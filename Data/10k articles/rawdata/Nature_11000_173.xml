      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2285">'''Archeio-Marxism''' ({{lang-el|αρχειομαρξισμός}}) was a radical left political movement that was active in [[interwar]] [[Greece]]. The main motto of its supporters was "first education and then action" and they were against mass demonstrations and [[Industrial unionism|unionism]]. They were named after the ''Archive of Marxism'' ({{lang-el|Αρχείο Μαρξισμού}}) magazine, that was published in 1921. 

From 1930 to 1934, the organization was a member of [[Trotsky]]'s [[International Left Opposition]], renaming itself officially as the '''Bolshevist–Leninist Organization of Greece – Archeio-Marxists''' (Κομμουνιστική Οργάνωση Μπολσεβίκων Λενινιστών Ελλάδας - Αρχειομαρξιστών). With some 2,000 members, it constituted the ILO's largest member group, and its leader, [[Dimitris Giotopoulos]] (alias: "Witte") occupied an important position in its secretariat. 

Following Giotopoulos' quarrel with Trotsky in 1933-1934, the Archeio-Marxists left the ILO, and by the late 1930s, they became affiliated with the so-called "[[London Bureau]]", having formed the [[Communist Archio-Marxist Party of Greece]]. The organization survived the repression of the [[Metaxas Regime]], but its members came under increasing attack from both right-wing groups and the [[Communist Party of Greece|KKE]]-led [[EAM-ELAS]] resistance front at the end of World War II and during the [[Greek Civil War]].

'''Artificial Life''' is a free and [[Open-source software|open source]]d [[Java (programming language)|Java]] [[Software framework|framework]] created to simulate [[Life]]. It is a multi-agents framework where each agent runs its own Thread.

The agents are split into two different categories: the services and the processes. The services deliver services to other agents and the processes execute specific tasks.

The agents are organized in a [[tree structure]] called Instance. Within an Instance, the services and the processes are grouped together and unlimited groups can be defined. Each node of the Instance tree can have a collection of views used to monitor the activity of the node or interact with the node. The definition of Java classes used within the Instance (i.e. processes, services or views) is defined in the Instance Model.

In order to avoid dead locking, [[Artificial life|Artificial Life]] implements a messaging system, a method invocation mechanism based on the messaging system and an event mechanism also based on the messaging system.

A '''biological rule''' or '''biological law''' is a generalized [[law (science)|law]], [[principle]], or [[rule of thumb]] formulated to describe patterns observed in living organisms. Biological rules and laws are often developed as succinct, broadly applicable ways to explain complex phenomena or salient observations about the [[ecology]] and [[biogeography|biogeographical]] distributions of plant and animal [[species]] around the world, though they have been proposed for or extended to all types of organisms. Many of these regularities of ecology and biogeography are named after the biologists who first described them.&lt;ref name="Jørgensen2002"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jørgensen |first1=Sven Erik |title=Explanation of ecological rules and observation by application of ecosystem theory and ecological models|journal=Ecological Modelling |volume=158 |issue=3 |year=2002 |pages=241–248 |doi=10.1016/S0304-3800(02)00236-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Allee |first=W.C. |last2=Schmidt |first2=K.P. |date=1951 |title=Ecological Animal Geography |edition=2nd |pages=457, 460–472}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the birth of their science, biologists have sought to explain apparent regularities in observational data. In [[Aristotle's biology|his biology]], [[Aristotle]] inferred rules governing differences between live-bearing [[tetrapod]]s (in modern terms, terrestrial placental [[mammal]]s). Among his rules were that [[brood size]] decreases with adult body mass, while [[life expectancy|lifespan]] increases with [[gestation period]] and with body mass, and [[fecundity]] decreases with lifespan. Thus, for example, elephants have smaller and fewer broods than mice, but longer lifespan and gestation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Leroi |first=Armand Marie |authorlink=Armand Marie Leroi |title=The Lagoon: How Aristotle Invented Science |titlelink=Aristotle's Lagoon |publisher=Bloomsbury |date=2014 |isbn=978-1-4088-3622-4 |page=408}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rules like these concisely organized the sum of knowledge obtained by early scientific measurements of the natural world, and could be used as [[scientific model|models]] to predict future observations. Among the earliest biological rules in modern times are those of [[Karl Ernst von Baer]] (from 1828 onwards) on [[embryogenesis|embryonic development]],&lt;ref name=Lovtrup/&gt; and of [[Constantin Wilhelm Lambert Gloger]] on animal pigmentation, in 1833.&lt;ref name=Gloger/&gt;
There is some [[scepticism]] among biogeographers about the usefulness of general rules. For example, J.C. Briggs, in his 1987 book ''Biogeography and Plate Tectonics'', comments that while [[Willi Hennig]]'s rules on [[cladistics]] "have generally been helpful", his progression rule is "suspect".&lt;ref name="Briggs1987"&gt;{{cite book |last=Briggs |first=J.C. |title=Biogeography and Plate Tectonics |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vCNG2e5K-YgC&amp;pg=PA11 |year=1987 |publisher=Elsevier |isbn=978-0-08-086851-6 |page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The competition leads either to the extinction of the weaker competitor or to an [[evolution]]ary or behavioral shift toward a different [[ecological niche]].&lt;ref name=hardin60&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hardin, Garrett |title=The competitive exclusion principle |journal=Science |volume=131 |pages=1292–1297 |issue=3409 |year=1960 |url=http://www.esf.edu/efb/schulz/seminars/hardin.pdf |format=PDF |doi=10.1126/science.131.3409.1292 |pmid=14399717}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Gloger's rule]]''' states that within a species of [[Warm-blooded|endotherms]], more heavily [[biological pigment|pigmented]] forms tend to be found in more [[humid]] environments, e.g. near the [[equator]].

* '''[[Haldane's rule]]''' states that if in a [[species]] [[hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] only one sex is [[Sterility (physiology)|sterile]], that sex is usually the [[heterogametic sex]]. The heterogametic sex is the one with two different sex chromosomes; in mammals, this is the male, with XY chromosomes. It is named after [[J.B.S.

* '''[[Van Valen's law]]''' states that the probability of [[extinction]] for species and higher taxa (such as families and orders) is constant for each group over time; groups grow neither more resistant nor more vulnerable to extinction, however old their lineage is.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10432">The '''Carnot method''' is an allocation procedure for dividing up fuel input ([[primary energy]], end energy) in joint production processes that generate two or more energy products in one process (e.g. [[cogeneration]] or trigeneration). It is also suited to allocate other streams such as [[CO2 emissions|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-emissions]] or variable costs. The potential to provide physical work ([[exergy]]) is used as the distribution key. For heat this potential can be assessed the [[Carnot efficiency]]. Thus, the Carnot method is a form of an exergetic allocation method. It uses mean heat grid temperatures at the output of the process as a calculation basis. The Carnot method's advantage is that no external reference values are required to allocate the input to the different output streams; only endogenous process parameters are needed. Thus, the allocation results remain unbiased of assumptions or external reference values that are open for discussion. 

== Fuel allocation factor ==

The fuel share a&lt;sub&gt;el&lt;/sub&gt; which is needed to generate the combined product electrical energy W (work) and a&lt;sub&gt;th&lt;/sub&gt; for the thermal energy H (useful heat) respectively, can be calculated accordingly to the first and second [[laws of thermodynamics]] as follows:

a&lt;sub&gt;el&lt;/sub&gt;= (1 &amp;middot; η&lt;sub&gt;el&lt;/sub&gt;) / (η&lt;sub&gt;el&lt;/sub&gt; + η&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;middot; η&lt;sub&gt;th&lt;/sub&gt;)

a&lt;sub&gt;th&lt;/sub&gt;= (η&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;middot; η&lt;sub&gt;th&lt;/sub&gt;) / (η&lt;sub&gt;el&lt;/sub&gt; + η&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;middot; η&lt;sub&gt;th&lt;/sub&gt;)

Note: a&lt;sub&gt;el&lt;/sub&gt; + a&lt;sub&gt;th&lt;/sub&gt; = 1&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt; 
with&lt;br&gt;
a&lt;sub&gt;el&lt;/sub&gt;: allocation factor for electrical energy, i.e. the share of the fuel input which is allocated to electricity production&lt;br&gt;
a&lt;sub&gt;th&lt;/sub&gt;: allocation factor for thermal energy, i.e. the share of the fuel input which is allocated to heat production&lt;br&gt;

η&lt;sub&gt;el&lt;/sub&gt; = W/Q&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;br&gt;
η&lt;sub&gt;th&lt;/sub&gt; = H/Q&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;br&gt;
W: electrical work &lt;br&gt;
H: useful heat &lt;br&gt;
Q&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;: Total heat, fuel or primary energy input&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
and &lt;br&gt;
η&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;: Carnot factor 1-T&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;/T&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; (Carnot factor for electrical energy is 1)&lt;br&gt;
T&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;: lower temperature, inferior (ambient) &lt;br&gt;
T&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;: upper temperature, superior (useful heat) &lt;br&gt;

In heating systems, a good approximation for the upper temperature is the average between forward and return flow on the distribution side of the heat exchager.&lt;br&gt;
T&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; = (T&lt;sub&gt;FF&lt;/sub&gt;+T&lt;sub&gt;RF&lt;/sub&gt;) / 2 &lt;br&gt;
or - if more thermodynamic precision is needed - the logarithmic mean temperature&lt;ref&gt;

If process steam is delivered which condenses and evaporates at the same temperature, T&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; is the temperature of the [[Water_(data_page)#Water/steam_equilibrium_properties|saturated steam of a given pressure]].

== Fuel factor ==

The fuel intensity or the fuel factor for electrical energy f&lt;sub&gt;F,el&lt;/sub&gt; resp. thermal energy f&lt;sub&gt;F,th&lt;/sub&gt; is the relation of specific input to output.

f&lt;sub&gt;F,el&lt;/sub&gt;= a&lt;sub&gt;el&lt;/sub&gt; / η&lt;sub&gt;el&lt;/sub&gt; =  1 / (η&lt;sub&gt;el&lt;/sub&gt; + η&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;middot; η&lt;sub&gt;th&lt;/sub&gt;)

f&lt;sub&gt;F,th&lt;/sub&gt;= a&lt;sub&gt;th&lt;/sub&gt; / η&lt;sub&gt;th&lt;/sub&gt; = η&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; / (η&lt;sub&gt;el&lt;/sub&gt; + η&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;middot; η&lt;sub&gt;th&lt;/sub&gt;)

== Primary energy factor ==

To obtain the primary energy factors of cogenerated heat and electricity, the energy prechain needs to be considered.

f&lt;sub&gt;PE,el&lt;/sub&gt; = f&lt;sub&gt;F,el&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;middot; f&lt;sub&gt;PE,F&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;br&gt;
f&lt;sub&gt;PE,th&lt;/sub&gt; = f&lt;sub&gt;F,th&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;middot; f&lt;sub&gt;PE,F&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
with &lt;br&gt;
f&lt;sub&gt;PE,F&lt;/sub&gt;: primary energy factor of the used fuel&lt;br&gt;

== Effective efficiency ==

The reciprocal value of the fuel factor (f-intensity) describes the effective efficiency of the assumed sub-process, which in case of CHP is only responsible for electrical or thermal energy generation. This equivalent efficiency corresponds to the effective efficiency of a "virtual boiler" or a "virtual generator" within the CHP plant.
 
η&lt;sub&gt;el,eff&lt;/sub&gt; = η&lt;sub&gt;el&lt;/sub&gt; / a&lt;sub&gt;el&lt;/sub&gt; = 1 / f&lt;sub&gt;F,el&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;br&gt;
η&lt;sub&gt;th,eff&lt;/sub&gt; = η&lt;sub&gt;th&lt;/sub&gt; / a&lt;sub&gt;th&lt;/sub&gt; = 1 / f&lt;sub&gt;F,th&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
with &lt;br&gt; 
η&lt;sub&gt;el,eff&lt;/sub&gt;: effective efficiency of electricity generation within the CHP process&lt;br&gt;
η&lt;sub&gt;th,eff&lt;/sub&gt;: effective efficiency of heat generation within the CHP process&lt;br&gt;

== Performance factor of energy transformation ==

Next to the efficiency factor which describes the quantity of usable end energies, the quality of energy transformation according to the [[Second law of thermodynamics|entropy law]] is also important. With rising [[entropy]], [[exergy]] declines. Exergy does not only consider energy but also energy quality. It can be considered a product of both. Therefore any energy transformation should also be assessed according to its exergetic efficiciency or loss ratios. The quality of the product "thermal energy" is fundamentally determined by the mean temperature level at which this heat is delivered. Hence, the exergetic efficiency η&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; describes how much of the fuel's potential to generate physical work remains in the joint energy products. With cogeneration the result is the following relation:  

η&lt;sub&gt;x,total&lt;/sub&gt; = η&lt;sub&gt;el&lt;/sub&gt; + η&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;middot; η&lt;sub&gt;th&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The allocation with the Carnot method always results in:&lt;br&gt; 
η&lt;sub&gt;x,total&lt;/sub&gt; = η&lt;sub&gt;x,el&lt;/sub&gt; = η&lt;sub&gt;x,th&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
with&lt;br&gt;
η&lt;sub&gt;x,total&lt;/sub&gt; = exergetic efficiency of the combined process&lt;br&gt;
η&lt;sub&gt;x,el&lt;/sub&gt; = exergetic efficiency of the virtual electricity-only process&lt;br&gt;
η&lt;sub&gt;x,th&lt;/sub&gt; = exergetic efficiency of the virtual heat-only process&lt;br&gt; 

The main application area of this method is cogeneration, but it can also be applied to other processes generating a joint products, such as a chiller generating cold and producing [[waste heat]] which could be used for low temperature heat demand, or a refinery with different liquid fuels plus heat as an output.

== Mathematical derivation == 

Let's assume a joint production with Input ''I'' and a first output ''O&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' and a second output ''O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''. ''f'' is a factor for rating the relevant product in the domain of primary energy, or fuel costs, or emissions, etc. 

evaluation of the input = evaluation of the output

f&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;middot; I  =  f&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;middot; O&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + f&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;middot; O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; 

The factor for the input ''f&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' and the quantities of ''I'', ''O&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'', and ''O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' are known. An equation with two unknowns ''f&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''f&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' has to be solved, which is possible with a lot of adequate tuples. As second equation, the physical transformation of product ''O&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' in ''O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' and vice versa is used.    

O&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = η&lt;sub&gt;21&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;middot; O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

''η&lt;sub&gt;21&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the transformation factor from ''O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' into ''O&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'', the inverse ''1/η&lt;sub&gt;21&lt;/sub&gt;''=''η&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;'' describes the backward transformation. A reversible transformation is assumed, in order not to favour any of the two directions. Because of the exhangeability of ''O&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'', the assessment of the two sides of the equation above with the two factors ''f&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''f&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' should therefore result in an equivalent outcome. Output ''O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' evaluated with ''f&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' shall be the same as the amount of ''O&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' generated from ''O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' and evaluated with ''f&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''.  

f&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;middot; (η&lt;sub&gt;21&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;middot; O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) = f&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;middot; O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; 

If we put this into the first equation, we see the following steps:

f&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;middot; I = f&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;middot; O&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + f&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;middot; (η&lt;sub&gt;21&lt;/sub&gt; × O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)

f&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;middot; I = f&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;middot; (O&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + η&lt;sub&gt;21&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;middot; O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) 

f&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; = f&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;middot; (O&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/I + η&lt;sub&gt;21&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;middot; O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/I) 

f&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; = f&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;middot; (η&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + η&lt;sub&gt;21&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;middot; η&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) 

f&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = f&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; / (η&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + η&lt;sub&gt;21&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;middot; η&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)
or respectively
f&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  = η&lt;sub&gt;21&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;middot; f&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; / (η&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + η&lt;sub&gt;21&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;middot; η&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) 

with ''η&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''O&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/I'' and ''η&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/I''

{{Notability|Org|date=February 2015}}

The '''Centers for Space Oceanography''' (CSO) are an operating division of the [http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/phod/argo/ Argos Foundation], Inc. CSO was established in August 2004 by a Memorandum of Understanding between the Argos Foundation, the [[Florida]] Aerospace Finance Corporation, the Florida Space Research Institute, and North American CLS, Inc. While operating under the corporate umbrella of the Argos Foundation, an executive appointee from each of the founding organizations form the Steering Committee of CSO. The first Chairman of the Steering Committee was Stephen Lee Morgan; the first Executive Director of CSO was Lawrence M. Harvey. In December 2005, NACLS withdrew from the Steering Committee, and was replaced by Gladius, LLC.

CSO exists to develop and operate "data fusion" capabilities involving the observation of the Earth's oceans from space, and tracking items (ranging from man-made assets such as ships, to [[marine mammal]]s and other animals) from space, enabling researchers to examine and understand the relationship of such "mobiles" with respect to physical [[oceanography|oceanographic]] elements (such as currents, waves, ocean temperature gradients, etc.). Working with a number of Industrial Team partners, CSO and its associated university and agency researchers develop capabilities, which are then made available to the general public at no charge or at cost.  Regionally specific affiliated centers are established to focus attention and resources upon a given region on the [[Earth]]'s surface. The first such regional center was the Caribbean Center for Ocean Management &amp; Research, established in Florida in 2006.

On 31 January 2006, CSO conducted its First CSO Symposium at [[Kennedy Space Center]], Florida, hosting over 30 attendees from Government, universities, U.S. Federal and Florida agencies, and Industrial Team executives.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nasa.gov/centers/kennedy/news/oceanography-sls.html "Monitoring the Seas from Space"] (NASA press release, February 16, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; CSO continues as a division of the not-for-profit Argos Foundation, while the affiliated regional centers are established as separate legal entities controlled by CSO, but in some cases are for-profit organizations.

      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9042">'''Contact electrification''' was an erroneous scientific theory from the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] that attempted to account for all the sources of [[Electrical charge|electric charge]] known at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Willem Hackmann,  "[http://ppp.unipv.it/Collana/Pages/Libri/Saggi/Nuova%20Voltiana3_PDF/cap5/5new.pdf The Enigma of Volta's "Contact Tension" and the Development of the "Dry Pile"]", appearing in ''[http://ppp.unipv.it/PagesIT/NuovaVoltFrame.htm Nuova Voltiana: Studies on Volta and His Times] Volume 3'' (Fabio Bevilacqua; Lucio Frenonese (Editors)), (2000) pp. 103-119&lt;/ref&gt; It has since been [[superseded scientific theory|superseded]] by more modern notions.  In the late 18th century, scientists developed sensitive instruments for detecting 'electrification', otherwise known as [[Electrostatics|electrostatic charge]] imbalance. The phenomenon of electrification by contact, or ''contact tension'',  was quickly discovered. When two objects were touched together, sometimes the objects became spontaneously charged. One object developed a net negative charge, while the other developed an equal and opposite positive charge. Then it was discovered that 'piles' of dissimilar metal disks separated by acid-soaked cloth, [[Voltaic pile]]s, could also produce charge differences.  Although it was later found that these effects were caused by different physical processes - [[triboelectricity]], the Volta effect, differing [[work function]]s of metals, and others - at the time they were all thought to be caused by a common 'contact electrification' process.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

The contact electrification phenomenon allowed the construction of so-called 'frictional' [[electrostatic generator]]s such as Ramsden's or Winter's machines, but it also led directly{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} to the development of useful devices such as [[Battery (electricity)|batteries]], [[fuel cell]]s, [[electroplating]], [[thermocouple]]s. Contact between materials is responsible for such modern electrical technology as semiconductor junction devices including [[crystal radio receiver|radio detector diodes]], [[solar cell|photocell]]s, [[light-emitting diode|LED]]s, and [[thermoelectric cell]]s.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

== History ==

The theory held that static electricity was generated by means of contact between dissimilar materials, and was in close agreement with the principles of [[static electricity]] as then understood. It was eventually replaced by the current theory of [[electrochemistry]], namely, that electricity is generated by the action of [[chemistry]] and the exchange of [[electron]]s between [[atom]]s making up the battery.  An important fact leading to the rejection of the theory of contact tension was the observation that [[corrosion]], that is, the chemical degradation of the battery, seemed unavoidable with its use, and that the more electricity was drawn from the battery, the faster the corrosion proceeded.

The Volta effect (described below) corresponds to a weak [[electric potential]] difference developed by the contact of different metals. Nowadays, this is often known as a [[contact potential difference]]. This effect was first discovered by [[Alessandro Volta]], and can be measured using a [[capacitance electroscope]] comprising different metals. However, this effect does not, by itself, account for the action of electric batteries.

A number of [[high voltage]] [[dry pile]]s were invented between the early 19th century and the 1830s in an attempt to determine the answer to this question, and specifically to support Volta’s hypothesis of contact tension. The [[Oxford Electric Bell]] is one example. [[Francis Ronalds]] in 1814 was one of the first to realise that dry piles also worked through chemical reaction rather than metal to metal contact, even though corrosion was not visible due to the very small currents generated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sir Francis Ronalds: Father of the Electric Telegraph|last=Ronalds|first=B.F.|publisher=Imperial College Press|year=2016|isbn=978-1-78326-917-4|location=London|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ronalds|first=B.F.|date=July 2016|title=Francis Ronalds (1788-1873): The First Electrical Engineer?|url=|journal=Proceedings of the IEEE|doi=10.1109/JPROC.2016.2571358|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Triboelectric contact==
{{main|Triboelectric effect}}
If two different [[Insulator (electricity)|insulators]] are touched together, such as when a piece of rubber is touched against a piece of glass, then the surface of the rubber will acquire an excess negative charge, and the glass will acquire an equal positive charge.  If the surfaces are then pulled apart, a very [[high voltage]] is produced.  This so-called "tribo" or "rubbing" effect is not well understood.  It may be caused by electron-stealing via [[quantum tunneling]], or by transfer of surface ions.  Friction is not required, although in many situations it greatly increases the phenomenon.  Certain phenomena related to frictionally generated electrostatic charges have been known since antiquity, though of course the modern theory of electricity was developed after the [[Scientific Revolution]].

==Electrolytic-metallic contact==
If a piece of metal is touched against an [[electrolyte|electrolytic]] material, the metal will spontaneously become charged, while the electrolyte will acquire an equal and opposite charge.  Upon first contact, a chemical reaction called a '[[half-cell reaction]]' occurs on the metal surface.  As metal ions are transferred to or from the electrolyte, and as the metal and electrolyte become oppositely charged, the increasing voltage at the thin insulating [[electrical double layer|layer]] between metal and electrolyte will oppose the motion of the flowing ions, causing the chemical reaction to come to a stop.  If a second piece of a different type of metal is placed in the same electrolyte bath, it will charge up and rise to a different voltage.  If the first metal piece is touched against the second, the voltage on the two metal pieces will be forced closer together, and the chemical reactions will run constantly.  In this way the 'contact electrification' becomes continuous.  At the same time, an electric current will appear, with the path forming a closed loop which leads from one metal part to the other, through the chemical reactions on the first metal surface, through the electrolyte, then back through the chemical reactions on the second metal surface.  In this way, contact electrification leads to the invention of the [[Galvanic cell]] or [[Battery (electricity)|battery]]. ''See also: [[Dry pile]]''

==Metallic contact==
{{main|Galvani potential}}
{{main|Volta potential}}
If two metals having differing [[work function]]s are touched together, one steals electrons from the other, and the opposite net charges grow larger and larger; this is the Volta effect.  The process is halted when the difference in [[electric potential]] (electrostatic potential) between the two metals reaches a particular value, namely the difference in work function values - usually less than one volt.  At this point, the Fermi levels for the two metals are equal, and there is no voltage difference between them. [If there were a voltage difference between them, then a current would flow between them:  so "zero current" implies "zero voltage difference".]

==Semiconductor contact==
If a metal touches a semiconductor material, or if two different semiconductors are placed into contact, one becomes charged slightly positive and the other slightly negative.  It is found that if this junction between semiconductors is connected to a power supply, and if the power supply is set to a voltage slightly higher than the natural voltage appearing because of contact electrification, then for one polarity of voltage there will be a current between the two semiconductor parts, but if the polarity is reversed, the current stops.  Thus contact between materials lead to the invention of the semiconductor [[diode]] or [[rectifier]] and triggered the revolution in [[Semiconductor device|semiconductor electronics]] and [[Semiconductor physics|physics]].

In materials with a [[direct band gap]], if bright light is aimed at one part of the contact area between the two semiconductors, the voltage at that spot will rise, and an electric current will appear.  When considering light in the context of contact electrification{{what|date=April 2014}}, the light energy is changed directly into electrical energy, allowing creation of [[solar cell]]s.  Later it was found that the same process can be reversed, and if a current is forced backwards across the contact region between the semiconductors, sometimes light will be emitted, allowing creation of the [[light-emitting diode]] (LED).

'''Cooks Monument and Reserve''' is a heritage-listed [[memorial]] at Charlotte Street, [[Cooktown, Queensland|Cooktown]], [[Shire of Cook]], [[Queensland]], Australia. It was designed in the office of the [[Queensland Colonial Architect]] and built by Hobbs and Carter in 1887. It was added to the [[Queensland Heritage Register]] on 30 April 1997.&lt;ref name=qhr&gt;{{cite QHR|16891|Cooks Monument and Reserve|601044|accessdate=1 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Captain Cook Memorial, Cooktown.jpg|thumb|Original design of the monument included a statue of Cook at the top]]
The Cook Monument at Cooktown was erected in 1887 by Hobbs and Carter of [[South Brisbane, Queensland|South Brisbane]], to designs prepared in the office of the Queensland Colonial Architect, [[George St Paul Connolly]].&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

Cooktown had been established in September 1873 as the [[Endeavour River]] port for the [[Palmer River]] goldfields. By the mid-1880s it was serving one of the most significant goldfields in Queensland. A railway was constructed from Cooktown to [[Laura, Queensland|Laura]] between 1884 and 1888, further opening the port to development. By the late 1880s Cooktown had become the important centre not only of a thriving mining district (boosted by the 1887 discovery of tin along the [[Annan River]]), but also of [[Pearl diving|pearling]], [[Sea cucumber as food|beche-de-mer]], and pastoral activity. After 1885, Cooktown was also the main port for Queensland trade with [[New Guinea]].&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

In May 1886, the then [[Premier of Queensland]], Sir [[Samuel Walker Griffith]], travelled to Cooktown and other northern ports on a tour of inspection, partly associated with defence issues, more with political strategy. The [[Separation of North Queensland|Separation]] movement was gaining momentum in [[Townsville]] and the far north, and Griffith was keen to demonstrate his government's commitment to, and concern for, northern Queensland. The [[Cooktown Municipal Council]] at this time was seeking to commemorate [[James Cook]]'s encampment at the Endeavour River in the winter of [[1770, Queensland|1770]], and it appears that Griffith, as political expediency, committed the Colonial Architect's office to designing the Cook monument at Cooktown.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

The Cooktown Municipal Council had intended that the monument include a statue of James Cook, but when tenders were called in June 1886, then again in September 1886 and February 1887 with different materials specified, they were for the column only. In December 1887 Sir Samuel Griffith re-visited Cooktown, and when requested by the mayor to provide assistance in commissioning the statue, refused, stating that it was more important to commemorate the event than the person.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

The contract had been let in February 1887 to Hobbs and Carter of South Brisbane, with a price of {{A£|1,059}} and completion time of 8 months. It appears that the memorial was not constructed on the site originally proposed, which necessitated an additional foundation, bringing the final cost to {{A£|1,297}}. The foundation stone was laid on 1 September 1887 by the Mayor of Cooktown, John Savage, and the work had been completed by January 1888. [[Sandstone]] used in the construction came from [[Murphys Creek, Queensland|Murphys Creek]] in southeast Queensland, and it was reputedly the first stone structure erected in Cooktown.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

Around the monument, a small ({{convert|1.5|acre}}) reserve for municipal purposes was gazetted in June 1888. A brick-lined town well, believed to have been built by the Cooktown Municipal Council to service ships berthed at the nearby Cooktown wharves, was constructed in the reserve, south of the monument. This work probably was undertaken post-1888, as the Council filled in much of the Cook Monument Reserve in 1889. A small vertical boiler engine pumped water from the well to the wharves through a 3" diameter pipe. It is understood that the well has also supplied adjacent Charlotte Street businesses from time to time.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

In the 20th century, several other memorials were erected within the reserve:&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;
* Kennedy Memorial: a granite cairn erected in 1948 to honour British explorer [[Edmund Besley Court Kennedy]], who was killed by Aborigines on [[Cape York Peninsula]] (part of Cook Shire) in December 1848. Kennedy's exploratory work helped to open far north Queensland to pastoral settlement in the mid-19th century. The memorial was unveiled on 25 September 1948 by the Chair of the [[Shire of Cook|Cook Shire Council]], Mayor WCH Hodges.&lt;ref name="qhr" /&gt;
* National Horse Trail Marker: a small granite cairn erected in August 1977 to mark the beginning of the [[The National Horse Trail|National Horse Trail]] from Cooktown to Melbourne, and the epic ride of Dan Seymour, who in the early 1970s demonstrated the feasibility of such a trail. The trail was mapped between 1974 and the 1980s, when it was made a bi-centennial project. Sections are used regularly, but few people have ridden the full distance. The marker was erected by the Australian Trail Horse Riders' Association and was unveiled by Henry Tranter, President of the Tablelands Trail Horse Riders' Club.&lt;ref name="qhr" /&gt;
* Annan River Water Supply Memorial Fountain: in 1989 the old town well on the reserve was cleaned out and a fountain constructed over it to commemorate the inauguration in November 1989 of a new permanent water supply from the [[Annan River]] to Cooktown. The Annan River pipeline was a joint federal, state and local government project, replacing Cooktown's previous water supply from the bore fields on the southern outskirts of the town.&lt;ref name="qhr" /&gt;
* 1803 Cannon: There is now located in the reserve a cannon cast in 1803 in [[Carron, Falkirk|Carron]], Scotland, and bearing the royal monogram GR. During the height of the "Russian invasion" scare of 1885, the Cooktown Municipal Council telegraphed to the [[Premier of Queensland]], requesting him to supply arms, ammunition and an officer to take charge of the Cooktown volunteer defence force. This cannon was sent, along with 3 cannonballs, 2 rifles and 1 officer. Initially the cannon was located on the foreshore near the [[Cooktown Powder Magazine]] on Webber Esplanade, overlooking the entrance to Cooktown Harbour on the Endeavour River estuary. It is fired once a year as part of the annual Cook's landing re-enactment celebrations.&lt;ref name="qhr" /&gt;

== Description ==
Cook's Monument is situated in a small reserve located between Charlotte Street and the Endeavour River estuary, on a slight rise adjacent to the site where James Cook beached the barque Endeavour for repairs in mid-1770. The reserve is grassed, with palms and mature trees around the perimeter.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

The monument comprises a tall, slender sandstone [[column]], topped with a detailed capital, which rises from a square [[pedestal]] resting upon a granite base and [[plinth]]. The steps of the plinth lead to a square dado incorporating drinking [[fountain]]s on each side. These fountains were once linked to a regular water supply [possibly an internal tank], and the water outlets emerge from the mouths of sculpted animal heads. The dado is set beneath a modest [[entablature]] and the [[pediment]] is flanked by sandstone urns at each corner.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

To the north of the Cook Monument is the 1803 cannon sent in 1885 to Cooktown by the Queensland colonial government, for the use of the local volunteer defence force. It stands on a concrete platform. Adjacent to the gun is an interpretative sign.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

To the south of the Cook Monument, but within the same reserve, are three more recent memorials and the early town well:&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;
* Kennedy Memorial: a conical-shaped granite cairn, approximately {{convert|1.2|m}} high, resting on a concrete base, with an embossed brass plaque in the face addressing Charlotte Street.&lt;ref name="qhr" /&gt;
* National Horse Trail Marker: a simple granite cairn or marker approximately {{convert|0.5|m}} high, conical in shape, with an embossed brass plaque in the face addressing Charlotte Street.&lt;ref name="qhr" /&gt;
* Annan River Water Supply Memorial Fountain and Early Town Well: The fountain comprises a series of metal water pipes constructed over an early, brick-lined town well. The well has a diameter of {{convert|23|ft}} at ground level, from which the shaft is bricked down {{convert|16|ft}} to a {{convert|4|ft|6|in|adj=on}} wide ledge, after which it narrows to {{convert|14|ft|adj=on}} diameter, and is bricked down a further {{convert|8|ft|4|in}}, at the bottom of which are granite slabs. In the wall of the upper shaft are two arched entrances, now filled in with rubble, leading to underground spider channels or aqueducts which formerly fed the well with storm water run-off, in addition to the ground water from below. Formerly there were three cross-logs let into the walls near the top, for roof joist supports. Adjacent to the well was a tank stand with engine and boiler beneath. Water was pumped form the well to the tank, then from the tank to the wharves via a galvanised pipe along the foreshore. .Above the bricks are several courses of cement blocks [added at a later date], topped by a metal railing added in 1989 as part of the conversion to a fountain. The capacity of the well is approximately {{convert|47,000|impgal}}.&lt;ref name="qhr" /&gt;

== Heritage listing ==
Cooks Monument and Reserve was listed on the [[Queensland Heritage Register]] on 30 April 1997 having satisfied the following criteria.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

'''The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history.'''

Cook's Monument and Reserve is significant historically for its commemoration of Cook's encampment below Grassy Hill, at the mouth of the Endeavour River, in mid-1770 - the first official British sojourn on the east coast of Australia. The place is significant also as Queensland's earliest memorial to James Cook and the crew of the Endeavour, and illustrates Cooktown's early developed sense of historical importance.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

The site contains an early brick-lined town well, which is important in illustrating the establishment of municipal services in early Cooktown.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

'''The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places.'''

The monument is a fine example of its type and one of the finest sandstone public memorials in Queensland. It is also an excellent example of the work of the Queensland colonial architect's office under George St Paul Connolly.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

'''The place is important because of its aesthetic significance.'''

Its aesthetic setting within a grassy, treed reserve contributes significantly to the townscape of Cooktown, and from the Endeavour River estuary is a Cooktown landmark.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

'''The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons.'''

The place has a special association for the people of Cooktown with their sense of historical identity. A number of other memorials have been placed in the reserve, illustrating this continued association.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

'''Ecoult''' is an [[energy storage]] company based out of [[Australia]].

==Company history==
Ecoult was originally formed in 2007 by the Australian Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation ([[CSIRO]]). CSIRO invented the [[UltraBattery]], a hybrid [[ultracapacitor]] and [[lead-acid battery]] technology, and formed a subsidiary company, Ecoult, to commercialize the technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Australia's Largest Battery Based Renewable Energy|url=http://www.pacetoday.com.au/news/australia-s-largest-battery-based-renewable-energy|publisher=Pace Today|accessdate=10 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2010, East Penn Manufacturing acquired Ecoult from CSIRO, along with the global license to manufacture the UltraBattery (outside Japan and Thailand where [[Furukawa Co.|Furukawa Battery]] holds the head license).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ultrabattery|url=http://www.csiro.au/Outcomes/Energy/Storing-renewable-energy/Ultra-Battery/Commercialisation.aspx|publisher=[[CSIRO]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ecoult was named in the Cleantech Group's 2013 Global Cleantech 100 in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Cleantech top 100 list|url=http://www.cleantech.com/global100/global-cleantech-100/|publisher=Cleantech|accessdate=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Global Cleantech top 100 list|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ecoult-makes-the-global-cleantech-top-100-list-227145011.html|accessdate=12 December 2013|newspaper=[[PR Newswire]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''erosion index''' ('''EI''', also called the '''[[erodibility]] index''') is created by dividing potential erosion (from all sources except gully erosion) by the [[T value]], which is the rate of [[soil erosion]] above which long term productivity may be adversely affected. The [[erodibility]] index is used in conjunction with conservation compliance and the [[Conservation Reserve Program]]. For example, one of the eligibility requirements for the CRP is that land have an EI greater than 8.

[[Image:Ibm-tube.jpg|thumb|right|The evacuation tips of these tube are the narrow points at the top.]]
The '''evacuation tip''' is a port on any glass envelope or vessel inside of which specific gasses or a vacuum must be held. They are very often seen on [[nixie tube|nixies]] or [[vacuum tube]]s. It used to evacuate gases from the tube, and in the case of nixies, add the proper mix of gases before being sealed. It provides a convenient port for the amateur [[glasshacker]] to introduce gases to alter the performance of the tube. It is also known as the "tubulation" or "pip".

'''Freshwater ecosystems''' are a subset of Earth's [[aquatic ecosystem]]s. They include [[Lake ecosystem|lakes]] and [[pond]]s, [[River ecosystem|rivers]], [[stream]]s, [[spring (hydrosphere)|spring]]s, and [[wetland]]s&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Limnology : lake and river ecosystems|last=G.|first=Wetzel, Robert|date=2001|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=978-0127447605|edition=3rd|location=San Diego|oclc=46393244}}&lt;/ref&gt;. They can be contrasted with [[marine ecosystem]]s, which have a larger [[salt]] content. Freshwater habitats can be classified by different factors, including temperature, light penetration, nutrients, and vegetation.

Freshwater ecosystems can be divided into [[lentic ecosystem]]s (still water) and [[lotic ecosystem]]s (flowing water)&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;.

[[Limnology]] (and its branch [[freshwater biology]]) is a study about freshwater ecosystems&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;. It is a part of [[hydrobiology]].

Original attempts to understand and monitor freshwater ecosystems were spurred on by threats to human health&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rudolfs|first=Willem|last2=Falk|first2=Lloyd L.|last3=Ragotzkie|first3=R. A.|date=1950|title=Literature Review on the Occurrence and Survival of Enteric, Pathogenic, and Relative Organisms in Soil, Water, Sewage, and Sludges, and on Vegetation: I. Bacterial and Virus Diseases|journal=Sewage and Industrial Wastes|volume=22|issue=10|pages=1261–1281|jstor=25031419}}&lt;/ref&gt; (ex. Cholera outbreaks due to sewage contamination). Early monitoring focused on chemical indicators, then bacteria, and finally algae, fungi and protozoa. A new type of monitoring involves quantifying differing groups of organisms ([[macroinvertebrate]]s, [[macrophyte]]s and fish) and measuring the stream conditions associated with them&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Citation|last=Friberg|first=Nikolai|title=Biomonitoring of Human Impacts in Freshwater Ecosystems|date=2011|work=Advances in Ecological Research|pages=1–68|publisher=Elsevier|doi=10.1016/b978-0-12-374794-5.00001-8|isbn=9780123747945|last2=Bonada|first2=Núria|last3=Bradley|first3=David C.|last4=Dunbar|first4=Michael J.|last5=Edwards|first5=Francois K.|last6=Grey|first6=Jonathan|last7=Hayes|first7=Richard B.|last8=Hildrew|first8=Alan G.|last9=Lamouroux|first9=Nicolas}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

== Threats to freshwater ecosystems ==
Five broad threats to freshwater biodiversity include overexploitation, water pollution, flow modification, destruction or degradation of habitat, and invasion by exotic species&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dudgeon|first=David|last2=Arthington|first2=Angela H.|last3=Gessner|first3=Mark O.|last4=Kawabata|first4=Zen-Ichiro|last5=Knowler|first5=Duncan J.|last6=Lévêque|first6=Christian|last7=Naiman|first7=Robert J.|last8=Prieur-Richard|first8=Anne-Hélène|last9=Soto|first9=Doris|date=2005-12-12|title=Freshwater biodiversity: importance, threats, status and conservation challenges|journal=Biological Reviews|language=en|volume=81|issue=2|pages=163–82|doi=10.1017/s1464793105006950|pmid=16336747|issn=1464-7931|citeseerx=10.1.1.568.4047}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Recent extinction trends can be attributed largely to sedimentation, stream fragmentation, chemical and organic pollutants, dams, and invasive species&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;. Common chemical stresses on freshwater [[ecosystem health]] include acidification, [[eutrophication]] and copper and pesticide contamination&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Xu|first=F|date=2001-09|title=Lake Ecosystem Health Assessment: Indicators and Methods|journal=Water Research|volume=35|issue=13|pages=3157–3167|doi=10.1016/s0043-1354(01)00040-9|issn=0043-1354}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Extinction of freshwater fauna==

Over 123 freshwater fauna species have gone extinct in North America since 1900. Of North American freshwater species, an estimated 48.5% of mussels, 22.8% of [[gastropod]]s, 32.7% of crayfishes, 25.9% of amphibians, and 21.2% of fish are either endangered or threatened&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ricciardi|first=Anthony|last2=Rasmussen|first2=Joseph B.|date=1999-10-23|title=Extinction Rates of North American Freshwater Fauna|journal=Conservation Biology|language=en|volume=13|issue=5|pages=1220–1222|doi=10.1046/j.1523-1739.1999.98380.x|issn=0888-8892}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Extinction rates of many species may increase severely into the next century because of invasive species, loss of keystone species, and species which are already functionally extinct (e.g., species which are not reproducing)&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;. Even using conservative estimates, freshwater fish extinction rates in North America are 877 times higher than background extinction rates (1 in 3,000,000 years)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Burkhead|first=Noel M.|date=2012-09|title=Extinction Rates in North American Freshwater Fishes, 1900–2010|journal=BioScience|language=en|volume=62|issue=9|pages=798–808|doi=10.1525/bio.2012.62.9.5|issn=1525-3244}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Projected extinction rates for freshwater animals are around five times greater than for land animals, and are comparable to the rates for rainforest communities&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;. 

== Biomonitoring ==
Current freshwater biomonitoring techniques focus primarily on community structure, but some programs measure functional indicators like biochemical (or biological) oxygen demand, sediment oxygen demand, and dissolved oxygen&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. Macroinvertebrate community structure is commonly monitored because of the diverse taxonomy, ease of collection, sensitivity to a range of stressors, and overall value to the ecosystem&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Freshwater biomonitoring and benthic macroinvertebrates, 40-158.|last=Johnson|first=R. K.|last2=Wiederholm|first2=T.|last3=Rosenberg|first3=D. M.|publisher=|year=1993|isbn=|location=|pages=40–158}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Additionally, algal community structure (often using diatoms) is measured in biomonitoring programs. Algae are also taxonomically diverse, easily collected, sensitive to a range of stressors, and overall valuable to the ecosystem&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Citation|last=Stevenson|first=R. Jan|title=USE OF ALGAE IN ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENTS|date=2003|work=Freshwater Algae of North America|pages=775–804|publisher=Elsevier|doi=10.1016/b978-012741550-5/50024-6|isbn=9780127415505|last2=Smol|first2=John P.}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Algae grow very quickly and communities may represent fast changes in environmental conditions&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;. 

In addition to community structure, responses to freshwater stressors are investigated by experimental studies that measure organism behavioural changes, altered rates of growth, reproduction or mortality&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. Experimental results on single species under controlled conditions may not always reflect natural conditions and multi-species communities&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;.  

The use of reference sites is common when defining the idealized "health" of a freshwater ecosystem. Reference sites can be selected spatially by choosing sites with minimal impacts from human disturbance and influence&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. However, reference conditions may also be established temporally by using preserved indicators such as [[diatom]] valves, macrophyte pollen, insect chitin and fish scales can be used to determine conditions prior to large scale human disturbance&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. These temporal reference conditions are often easier to reconstruct in standing water than moving water because stable sediments can better preserve biological indicator materials.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3785">A '''fuath''' (plural ''fuathan''; {{IPA-gd|fuə}}) or '''vough''' (phonetic transcription), literally meaning "hate" in [[Scottish Gaelic]] and [[Irish Gaelic]], designates a class of malevolent [[Highland]] [[Celtic mythology|Gaelic mythological]] water spirits, inhabiting the sea, rivers, fresh water, or sea lochs.&lt;ref name="MacKillop"/&gt;

As a generic term the ''fuath'' can include the [[beithir]] ([[behir]]), [[peallaidh]] and [[ùruisg]].&lt;ref name="MacKillop"/&gt;
The "fuath" in collected Gaelic folklore is substituted by the term "[[kelpie]]" in the English translation and commentary portions of [[John Francis Campbell]]'s ''[[Popular Tales of the West Highlands]]''. More broadly, this name is even given to highland or nature spirits. 

Their appearance ranges from covered in shaggy, yellow fur to just having a mane down its back, webbed toes, tails with spikes, and no nose.{{sfnp|Rose|2000|p=126|ps=}} They are prone to wearing green, whether it be a dress, robe, or [[kirtle]], as it is the colour of [[faeries]].

They sometimes intermarry with human beings (typically the female), whose offspring will share a mane, tail, and/or webbed digits. Their banes include sunlight and cold steel, which will kill them instantly. They grow restless upon crossing a stream.

An alternative name for this class of monsters is Arrachd.&lt;ref name="MacKillop"/&gt;

Similarity or equivalence to the [[bean nighe]] or Northern Ireland's ''[[Each uisge|uisges]]'' have been noted.{{cn|date=July 2014}}

==Tales==
In "The Brollachan" (''Popular Tales'' II, Tale #37), a fuath is represented as being the mother of the brollachan (or brollichan), as a creature with eyes and a mouth but no shape, and limited ability of speech.{{sfnp|Campbell|1860a|p=II, 190&amp;ndash;192|ps=}}{{sfnp|Campbell|1860|p=I, 64, 190|ps=}} When Murray or "Ally" of the mill stoked the fire with fresh peat, it caused severe burns to the brollachan lying there, prompting a fuath who was the brollachan's mother to appear, demanding vengeance for her son. But the misshapen brollachan, when asked about the identity of the culprit, could only answer "me" and "you," and the fuath abandoned. Campbell draws the parallel with the story of the [[Cyclops]], who when attempting to name the man who blinded him could only say that it was "No man" who harmed him, because that was the pseudonym that [[Odysseus|Odysseus]] had given. This motif is also used in the Northumbrian tale of [[Ainsel]] or "My Own Self".

A '''glory''' is an [[optical phenomenon]], resembling an iconic [[saint]]'s [[halo (religious iconography)|halo]] around the shadow of the observer's head, caused by [[sunlight]] or (more rarely) [[moonlight]] interacting with the tiny water [[drop (liquid)|droplets]] that compose [[mist]] or [[cloud]]s. The glory consists of one or more [[concentric]], successively dimmer rings, each of which is red on the outside and bluish towards the centre. Due to its appearance, the phenomenon is sometimes mistaken for a [[Rainbow#Full-circle rainbow|circular rainbow]], but the latter has a much larger diameter and is caused by different physical processes.

Glories arise due to [[interference (wave propagation)|wave interference]] of light [[total internal reflection|internally refracted]] within small droplets.

== Appearance and observation ==

Depending on circumstances (such as the uniformity of droplet size in the clouds), one or more of the glory's rings can be visible. The angular size of the inner and brightest ring is much smaller than that of a [[rainbow]], about 5° to 20°, depending on the size of the droplets. In the right conditions, a glory and a rainbow can occur simultaneously.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wunderground.com/blog/JeffMasters/the-360degree-rainbow&lt;/ref&gt;

Like a rainbow, a glory is centered on the [[antisolar point|antisolar]] (or, in case of the Moon, antilunar) point, which coincides with the shadow of the observer's head. Since this point is by definition diametrically opposed to the Sun's (or Moon's) position in the sky, it always lies below the observer's horizon when the Sun (Moon) is up. In order to see a glory, therefore, the clouds or fog causing it must be located ''below'' the observer, in a straight line with the Sun/Moon and the observer's eye. Hence, the glory is commonly observed from a high viewpoint such as a mountain, tall building or from an aircraft. In the latter case, if the plane is flying sufficiently low for its shadow to be visible on the clouds, the glory always surrounds it. This is sometimes called ''The Glory of the Pilot''.

=== Brocken spectre ===
{{Main|Brocken spectre}}
[[File:Solar glory and Spectre of the Brocken from GGB on 07-05-2011.jpg|Solar glory and Spectre of the Brocken|thumb]]
When viewed from a mountain or tall building, glories are often seen in association with a [[Brocken spectre]], also called '''Mountain Spectre''', the apparently enormously magnified shadow of an observer, cast (when the Sun is low) on clouds below the mountain on which the viewer is standing. The name derives from the [[Brocken]], the tallest peak of the [[Harz]] mountain range in Germany. Because the peak is above the cloud level and the area frequently misty, conditions conducive to casting a shadow on a cloud layer are common.  Giant shadows that seemed to move by themselves due to movement of the cloud layer (this movement is another part of the definition of the Brocken Spectre), and that were surrounded by glories, may have contributed to the reputation the Harz mountains hold as a refuge for witches and evil spirits.  In [[Goethe]]'s [[Goethe's Faust|Faust]], the Brocken is called the ''[[Blocksberg]]'' and is the site of the [[Witches' Sabbath]] on [[Walpurgis Night]].

== Theory ==

The scientific explanation is still the subject of debates and research.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} In 1947, the Dutch astronomer [[Hendrik van de Hulst]] suggested that [[surface waves]] are involved. He speculated that the colored rings of the glory are caused by two-ray interference between "short" and "long" path surface waves—which are generated by light rays entering the droplets at diametrically opposite points (both rays suffer one internal reflection).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| url=http://www.philiplaven.com/p2c1a.html | title=How are glories formed | date=15 July 2008 | accessdate=13 December 2008 | last=Laven | first=Philip| postscript= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A new theory by Brazilian physicist [[Herch Moysés Nussenzveig]], however, suggests that the light energy beamed back by a glory originates mostly from [[classical wave tunneling]] (synonymous in the paper to the [[Evanescent field#Total internal reflection of light|evanescent wave coupling]]), which is an interaction between an evanescent light wave traveling along the surface of the drop and the waves inside the drop.&lt;ref name="Moyses"&gt;{{Citation| url=http://www.opticsinfobase.org/abstract.cfm?URI=ol-27-16-1379 | title=Does the glory have a simple explanation? Opt. Lett. 27, 1379–1381 (2002) | date= January 2012 | accessdate=8 January 2012 | postscript= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In culture ==

[[Charles Thomson Rees Wilson|C. T. R. Wilson]] saw a glory while working as a temporary observer at the [[Ben Nevis]] weather station. Inspired by the impressive sight, he decided to build a device for creating clouds in the laboratory, so that he could make a synthetic, small-scale glory.  His work led directly to the [[cloud chamber]], a device for detecting [[ionizing radiation]] for which he and Arthur Compton received the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1927.

In China, the phenomenon is called '''Buddha's light''' (or halo). It is often observed on cloud-shrouded high mountains, such as [[Huangshan]] and [[Mount Emei]]. Records of the phenomenon at Mount Emei date back to A.D. 63. The colorful halo always surrounds the observer's own shadow, and thus was often taken to show the observer's personal enlightenment (associated with [[Buddha]] or divinity).

Stylized glories appear occasionally in Western [[heraldry]]. Two glories appear on the [[Great Seal of the United States]]: A glory breaking through clouds surrounding a cluster of 13 stars on the obverse, and a glory surrounding the [[Eye of Providence]] surmounting an unfinished pyramid on the reverse.

=== In literature ===
Leo Frankowski made glories a key plot element in his ''[[Conrad Stargard]]'' saga, where the [[protagonist]] and title character is sent back in time to the 13th century where he has to establish himself and cope with various crises including planning for the eventual [[Mongol invasion]] of Eastern Europe in 1241. In the third book, ''The Radiant Warrior'', Stargard begins building a modern army and uses the reliable glories along one stretch of his boot camp to invoke religious faith-backed ''[[esprit de corps]]'' and feelings of elite invincibility in his newly forming cadre. The same phenomenon dupes the highly pious heir apparent of the Polish duchy into strongly supporting the new model army's pragmatic departures from the day's [[chivalry|chivalristic practices]].

This atmospheric effect also makes at least one appearance in [[Gothic fiction]]. In [[James Hogg]]'s ''[[The Private Memoirs and Confessions of a Justified Sinner]]'', George Colwan walks to the top of [[Arthur's Seat]] on a foggy day, while his half-brother Robert Wringhim secretly follows him with murderous intent. George sees shimmering colored light in front of him. Then he sees the shadow of an enormous dark figure advancing toward him threateningly—the [[Brocken spectre]] created by the shadow of Robert sneaking up behind him. In other words, the "good" George is surrounded by a glory, while the "evil" Robert appears as a dark spectre.

In [[Masami Kurumada]]'s ''[[Saint Seiya]]'' comic book, which is inspired by Greek mythology, warriors belonging to divine armies battle each other for possession of the Earth. The main characters, warriors known as Saints, belong to [[Athena]]'s army, and one of the antagonistic armies they face belongs to the Olympic Gods, composed of warriors called the Angels. As the Saints wear protective armors called Cloths, which represent the 88 astronomical constellations, the Angels don similar attire, their armors being known as Glory, which Kurumada named after the optical phenomenon in reference to it being traditionally associated to angels in religious imagery, and the Glory armors represent angels in different poses and sizes.

'''Harry Frauca''' (born 14 October 1928) was an [[Australia]]n [[Natural history|naturalist]], [[writer]] and [[photography|photographer]].  Of  Catalan origin, he moved to Australia in the 1950s and became an Australian citizen.  From 1960 he became a full-time writer and photographer on natural history.  From 1970 he collected insects for the [[Australian National Insect Collection]]. The last years of his life were spent in [[Bundaberg, Queensland]], with his wife Claudia dying in 1979.

He has been honoured in the name of the Harry Frauca Walkway, a 200 m walkway at Baldwin Swamp, Bundaberg, as well as the Harry Frauca Walking Track and Harry Frauca Information Panel at the [[Mount Walsh National Park]], [[Biggenden, Queensland|Biggenden]].

The '''Hydrogen Council''' is a group of 39 companies within energy, transport and industry who are working together to promote hydrogen as a key component of the energy transition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hydrogen Council|url=http://hydrogencouncil.com/|website=http://hydrogencouncil.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formation==

The Hydrogen Council announced their formation at the [[World Economic Forum]] in Davos on January 7, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Smedly|first1=Mark|title=Hydrogen lobby launched at Davos|url=https://www.naturalgasworld.com/hydrogen-promoted-at-davos-35437|website=naturalgasworld.com|publisher=Natural Gas World|accessdate=17 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aims of the initiative are 'to explain why [[hydrogen]] emerges among the key solutions for the [[energy transition]], in the mobility as well as in the power, industrial and residential sectors' as expressed by the CEO of Air Liquide in one of two formal statements&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New Hydrogen Council launches in Davos|url=http://www.h2fcsupergen.com/news/new-hydrogen-council-launches-davos/|website=http://www.h2fcsupergen.com|publisher=Imperial College London|accessdate=17 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; made at the Forum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Davos Summit: New 'Hydrogen Council' vows to accelerate global fuel cell market|url=https://www.businessgreen.com/bg/news/3002756/davos-summit-new-hydrogen-council-vows-to-accelerate-global-fuel-cell-market|website=businessgreen.com|publisher=businessGreen|accessdate=17 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; $10.7 billion were announced as being made available to support the aims of the council over a 5-year period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lippert|first1=John|title=Toyota, Shell Among Giants Betting $10.7 Billion on Hydrogen|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-01-17/toyota-shell-among-auto-and-oil-giants-forming-hydrogen-council|website=https://www.bloomberg.com|publisher=Bloomberg|accessdate=17 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=LeSage|first1=John|title=Why Are Shell And Toyota Backing Hydrogen Fuel Cell Vehicles?|url=https://oilprice.com/Alternative-Energy/Fuel-Cells/Why-Are-Shell-And-Toyota-Backing-Hydrogen-Fuel-Cell-Vehicles.html|website=https://oilprice.com/|publisher=OilPrice.com|accessdate=17 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Members===

Steering members include 3M, Air Liquide S.A., Alstom, Anglo American plc, Audi AG, BMW Group, Bosch, China Energy, Daimler AG, Engie S.A., GM, Great Wall Motor, Honda Motor Co. Ltd, Hyundai Motor Company, Iwatani Corporation, JXTG Nippon Oil &amp; Energy Corporation, Kawasaki Heavy Industries Ltd., Plastic Omnium, Royal Dutch Shell, Statoil ASA, The Linde Group, Total S.A., Toyota Motor Corporation and Weichai.

==Reports==

Two reports have been released by the Council ('How hydrogen empowers the energy transition' January 2017,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How hydrogen empowers the energy transition|url=https://hydrogeneurope.eu/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/20170109-HYDROGEN-COUNCIL-Vision-document-FINAL-HR.pdf|website=https://hydrogeneurope.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt; and '[http://hydrogencouncil.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Hydrogen-scaling-up-Hydrogen-Council.pdf  Hydrogen scaling up: A sustainable pathway for the global energy transition]' November 2017&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hydrogen scaling up|url=http://hydrogencouncil.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Hydrogen-scaling-up-Hydrogen-Council.pdf|website=http://hydrogencouncil.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;) outlining a path towards increased use of hydrogen as an energy carrier and feedstock within transport, industry applications, for residential and commercial building heat and for electricity generation. The reports were authored by the Study Task Force of the Hydrogen Council with analytical support from McKinsey &amp; Company.

Scenarios outlined in the reports suggest that hydrogen technologies could contribute to meeting 18% of the world’s final energy demands, avoiding 6 Gt of CO2 emissions and creating a market with revenues of $2.5 trillion each year while providing 30 million jobs by mid-century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=11 more multinationals join Hydrogen Council|url=http://www.greencarcongress.com/2018/03/20180313-hc.html|website=greencarcongress.com|publisher=Green Car Congress|accessdate=3 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Investments of $20–25 billion annually for a total of $280 billion up to 2030 are outlined within the reports.

==Business overview==

===OnSite Generation===
The OnSite Generation business segment is based on [[electrolysis of water|water electrolysis]] technology, which involves the decomposition of water into oxygen (O2) and hydrogen gas (H2) by passing an electric current through a liquid [[electrolyte]].&lt;ref name=Edgar /&gt; The resultant [[hydrogen]] gas is then captured and used for industrial gas applications, hydrogen fueling applications, and is used to store renewable and surplus energy in the form of hydrogen gas.&lt;ref name=Edgar /&gt; Hydrogenics' HySTAT electrolyzer products can be used both indoors and outdoors.&lt;ref name=Edgar /&gt;

===Power Systems===
The Power Systems business segment is based on PEM fuel cell technology, which transforms chemical energy resulting from the electrochemical reaction of [[hydrogen]] and [[oxygen]] into electrical energy. (Edgar) Its HyPM products can handle electrical power outputs ranging from 1 [[kilowatt]] to 1 [[megawatt]].&lt;ref name=Edgar /&gt; The company also develops and delivers hydrogen generation products based on PEM water electrolysis.&lt;ref name=Edgar /&gt;

===Power to Gas===
{{Main article|Power to gas}}
Power-to-Gas is an energy process and storage technology, which takes the excess power generated by [[wind turbine]]s, [[solar power]], or [[biomass]] power plants and converts [[carbon dioxide]] and [[water]] into [[methane]] using [[electrolysis]], enabling it be stored.&lt;ref name=CleanTech&gt;{{cite news |title=Germany To Begin Renewable Power-To-Gas Research Project |author=Tim Tyler |publisher=Clean Technia |date=24 May 2013 |url=http://cleantechnica.com/2013/05/24/germany-to-begin-renewable-power-to-gas-research-project/ |accessdate=31 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GridGas&gt;{{cite web|title=Power to Gas |publisher=GridGas |url=http://www.gridgas.co.uk/power-to-gas.html |accessdate=31 July 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140601060853/http://www.gridgas.co.uk/power-to-gas.html |archivedate=1 June 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GTAI&gt;{{cite web |title=GTAI Power-to-Gas Technology |url=http://www.gtai.de/GTAI/Navigation/EN/Invest/Industries/Smarter-business/Smart-energy/power-to-gas.html |accessdate=31 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The excess [[electricity]] can then be held in existing reserves, including power and natural gas grids.&lt;ref name=GridGas /&gt;&lt;ref name=GTAI /&gt; This allows for seasonally adjusted storage of significant amounts of power and the provision of CO2-neutral fuels in the form of the resulting [[renewable energy]] source gas.&lt;ref name=GridGas /&gt;&lt;ref name=GTAI /&gt;

==History==
In 1988, Hydrogenics was founded under the name Traduction Militech Translation Inc.&lt;ref name=FuelCellsBook&gt;{{cite book |last=Hikosaka Behling |first=Noriko |title=Fuel Cells, Current Technology Challenges and Future Research Needs |publisher=[[Elsevier]] |date=2013 |ISBN=978-0-444-56325-5 |pages=435, 446–7, 456, 528, 558–560, 563}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995, it entered into the fuel cell technology development business and Traduction Militech Translation changed its name to Hydrogenics in 1990.&lt;ref name=FuelCellsBook /&gt;

In 2002, Hydrogenics acquired EnKAT GmbH, which formed its Hydrogenics Europe division.&lt;ref name=profit&gt;{{cite news |title=Generation H |author=Lee Oliver |date=1 June 2003 |publisher=Profit Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also acquired Greenlight Power Technologies, Inc., a competing fuel cell testing business, in 2003.&lt;ref name=profit /&gt; A year later, in 2004, the company acquired Stuart Energy, a manufacturer of hydrogen-generation products based on alkaline electrolyte technology.&lt;ref name=FuelCellsBook /&gt;&lt;ref name=FuelCellsBulletin&gt;{{cite news |title=Hydrogenics succeeds in Stuart Energy bid |date=February 2005 |publisher=Fuel Cells Bulletin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Hydrogenics narrowed the focus of its fuel cell activities by exiting the fuel cell testing business and working more on forklift power and backup power markets.&lt;ref name=FuelCellsBook /&gt; That same year, Heliocentris partnered with Hydrogenics and SMA Solar Technologie to incorporate Hydrogenics' fuel cell power modules into stationary backup power systems.&lt;ref name=FuelCellsBook /&gt;

In September 2010, Hydrogenics formed an alliance with [[CommScope Inc.]], a [[Hickory, North Carolina]]-based multinational [[telecommunication]]s company.&lt;ref name=iStock&gt;{{cite news|title=Hydrogenics (HYGS) Receives Power Modules Order From Commscope |date=5 December 2012 |url=http://www.istockanalyst.com/finance/story/6175387/hydrogenics-hygs-receives-power-modules-order-from-commscope |accessdate=31 July 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140814102857/http://www.istockanalyst.com/finance/story/6175387/hydrogenics-hygs-receives-power-modules-order-from-commscope |archivedate=14 August 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Per the alliance, CommScope invested US$8.5 million in Hydrogenics as part of a joint product development program.&lt;ref name=FuelCellsBook /&gt;&lt;ref name=CanadianMan&gt;{{cite news |title=Power-to-gas technology enables utility-scale storage of renewable energy |publisher=Clean Tech Canada |url=http://www.canadianmanufacturing.com/technology/power-to-gas-technology-enables-utility-scale-storage-of-renewable-energy-133691/#prclt-b5mi2t9U |accessdate=31 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Insulin''' (from [[Latin]] ''insula'', island) is a [[peptide hormone]] produced by [[beta cell]]s of the [[pancreatic islets]]; it is considered to be the main [[Anabolism|anabolic]] hormone of the body.&lt;ref name="Biochemistry"&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Voet D, Voet JG | title = Biochemistry | date = 2011 | publisher = Wiley | location = New York | edition = 4th }}&lt;/ref&gt; It regulates the [[metabolism]] of [[carbohydrate]]s, [[fat]]s and [[protein]] by promoting the absorption of carbohydrates, especially [[glucose]] from the blood into [[liver]], [[fat cell|fat]] and [[skeletal muscle]] cells.&lt;ref name=stryer&gt;{{cite book |last1= Stryer |first1= Lubert | name-list-format = vanc | title=Biochemistry. |edition= Fourth |location= New York |publisher= W.H. Freeman and Company|publication-date= 1995 |pages= 773–74|isbn= 0 7167 2009 4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In these tissues the absorbed glucose is converted into either [[glycogen]] via [[glycogenesis]] or [[Fatty acid metabolism#Glycolytic end products are used in the conversion of carbohydrates into fatty acids|fats]] ([[triglyceride]]s) via [[lipogenesis]], or, in the case of the liver, into both.&lt;ref name=stryer /&gt;  [[Glucose]] production and [[secretion]] by the liver is strongly inhibited by high concentrations of insulin in the blood.&lt;ref name="pmid10927996"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sonksen P, Sonksen J | title = Insulin: understanding its action in health and disease | journal = British Journal of Anaesthesia | volume = 85 | issue = 1 | pages = 69–79 | date = July 2000 | pmid = 10927996 | doi = 10.1093/bja/85.1.69 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Circulating insulin also affects the synthesis of proteins in a wide variety of tissues. It is therefore an anabolic hormone, promoting the conversion of small molecules in the blood into large molecules inside the cells. Low insulin levels in the blood have the opposite effect by promoting widespread [[catabolism]], especially of [[obesity|reserve body fat]].

&lt;!-- Regulation --&gt;
[[Beta cell]]s are sensitive to glucose concentrations, also known as [[blood sugar level]]s. When the glucose level is high, the beta cells secrete insulin into the blood; when glucose levels are low, secretion of insulin is inhibited.&lt;ref name=koeslag&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Koeslag JH, Saunders PT, Terblanche E | title = A reappraisal of the blood glucose homeostat which comprehensively explains the type 2 diabetes mellitus-syndrome X complex | journal = The Journal of Physiology | volume = 549 | issue = Pt 2 | pages = 333–46 | date = June 2003 | pmid = 12717005 | doi = 10.1113/jphysiol.2002.037895 | publication-date = 2003 | pmc=2342944}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Their neighboring [[alpha cell]]s, by taking their cues from the beta cells,&lt;ref name=koeslag /&gt; secrete [[glucagon]] into the blood in the opposite manner: increased secretion when blood glucose is low, and decreased secretion when glucose concentrations are high.&lt;ref name=stryer /&gt;&lt;ref name=koeslag /&gt; [[Glucagon]], through stimulating the liver to release glucose by [[glycogenolysis]] and [[gluconeogenesis]], has the opposite effect of insulin.&lt;ref name=stryer /&gt;&lt;ref name=koeslag /&gt; The secretion of insulin and glucagon into the blood in response to the blood glucose concentration is the primary mechanism of [[Blood sugar regulation|glucose homeostasis]].&lt;ref name=koeslag /&gt;

&lt;!-- Clinical significance --&gt;
If beta cells are destroyed by an [[autoimmunity|autoimmune reaction]], insulin can no longer be synthesized or be secreted into the blood. This results in [[Diabetes mellitus type 1|type 1 diabetes mellitus]], which is characterized by abnormally high blood glucose concentrations, and generalized body wasting.&lt;ref name="urlInsulin Injection - PubMed Health"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0000729 | title = Insulin Injection  | author = American Society of Health-System Pharmacists  | date = 2009-02-01 | work = PubMed Health | publisher = National Center for Biotechnology Information, U.S. National Library of Medicine | accessdate = 2012-10-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Diabetes mellitus type 2|type 2 diabetes mellitus]] the destruction of beta cells is less pronounced than in type 1 diabetes, and is not due to an autoimmune process. Instead there is an accumulation of [[amyloid]] in the pancreatic islets, which likely disrupts their anatomy and physiology.&lt;ref name=koeslag /&gt; The pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes is not well understood but patients exhibit a reduced population of islet beta-cells, reduced secretory function of islet beta-cells that survive, and peripheral tissue insulin resistance.&lt;ref name="Biochemistry"/&gt; Type 2 diabetes is characterized by high rates of glucagon secretion into the blood which are unaffected by, and unresponsive to the concentration of glucose in the blood. Insulin is still secreted into the blood in response to the blood glucose.&lt;ref name=koeslag /&gt; As a result, the insulin levels, even when the blood sugar level is normal, are much higher than they are in healthy persons.

&lt;!-- Structure --&gt;
The human insulin protein is composed of 51 [[amino acid]]s, and has a [[molecular mass]] of 5808 [[Dalton (unit)|Da]]. It is a [[protein dimer|dimer]] of an A-chain and a B-chain, which are linked together by [[disulfide bond]]s. Insulin's structure varies slightly between [[species]] of animals. Insulin from animal sources differs somewhat in effectiveness (in [[carbohydrate metabolism]] effects) from human insulin because of these variations. [[Pig|Porcine]] insulin is especially close to the [[human]] version, and was widely used to treat type 1 diabetics before human insulin could be produced in large quantities by [[Recombinant DNA#Applications of recombinant DNA technology|recombinant DNA]] technologies.&lt;ref name=recombination&gt;Drug Information Portal NLM – Insulin human USAN http://druginfo.nlm.nih.gov/drugportal/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="urlGenentech"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gene.com/media/press-releases/4160/1978-09-06/first-successful-laboratory-production-o|title=First Successful Laboratory Production of Human Insulin Announced | date=1978-09-06 |publisher=Genentech|access-date=|work=News Release|accessdate=2016-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="urlRecombinant DNA technology in the synthesis of human insulin"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.littletree.com.au/dna.htm | title = Recombinant DNA technology in the synthesis of human insulin | author = Tof I  | year = 1994 | work = | publisher = Little Tree Publishing | accessdate = 2009-11-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid23222785"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Aggarwal SR | title = What's fueling the biotech engine-2011 to 2012 | journal = Nature Biotechnology | volume = 30 | issue = 12 | pages = 1191–97 | date = December 2012 | pmid = 23222785| doi = 10.1038/nbt.2437 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- History, society and culture --&gt;
The [[crystal structure]] of insulin in the solid state was determined by [[Dorothy Hodgkin]]. It is on the [[WHO Model List of Essential Medicines]], the most important medications needed in a basic [[health system]].&lt;ref name=WHO2015E&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/medicines/publications/essentialmedicines/EML2015_8-May-15.pdf |title=19th WHO Model List of Essential Medicines (April 2015) |date=April 2015 |accessdate=May 10, 2015 |publisher=WHO }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[MafA]] is degraded by [[proteasomes]] upon low blood [[glucose]] levels. Increased levels of [[glucose]] make an unknown protein [[glycosylated]].

These transcription factors work synergistically and in a complex arrangement. Increased blood [[glucose]] can after a while destroy the binding capacities of these proteins, and therefore reduce the amount of insulin secreted, causing [[diabetes]]. The decreased binding activities can be mediated by [[glucose]] induced [[oxidative stress]] and [[antioxidants]] are said to prevent the decreased insulin secretion in glucotoxic pancreatic [[β cells]].

== Protein structure ==
{{See also|Insulin/IGF/Relaxin family|Insulin and its analog structure}}
Within vertebrates, the amino acid sequence of insulin is [[conserved sequence|strongly conserved]]. [[Cow|Bovine]] insulin differs from human in only three [[amino acid]] residues, and [[Pig|porcine]] insulin in one. Even insulin from some species of fish is similar enough to human to be clinically effective in humans. Insulin in some invertebrates is quite similar in sequence to human insulin, and has similar physiological effects. The strong homology seen in the insulin sequence of diverse species suggests that it has been conserved across much of animal evolutionary history. The C-peptide of [[proinsulin]] (discussed later), however, differs much more among species; it is also a hormone, but a secondary one.

Insulin is produced and stored in the body as a hexamer (a unit of six insulin molecules), while the active form is the monomer. The hexamer is an inactive form with long-term stability, which serves as a way to keep the highly reactive insulin protected, yet readily available. The hexamer-monomer conversion is one of the central aspects of insulin formulations for injection. The hexamer is far more stable than the monomer, which is desirable for practical reasons; however, the monomer is a much faster-reacting drug because diffusion rate is inversely related to particle size. A fast-reacting drug means insulin injections do not have to precede mealtimes by hours, which in turn gives people with diabetes more flexibility in their daily schedules.&lt;ref name="pmid16158220"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dunn MF | title = Zinc-ligand interactions modulate assembly and stability of the insulin hexamer – a review | journal = Biometals | volume = 18 | issue = 4 | pages = 295–303 | date = August 2005 | pmid = 16158220 | doi = 10.1007/s10534-005-3685-y }}&lt;/ref&gt; Insulin can aggregate and form [[fibrillar]] interdigitated [[beta-sheet]]s.

== Synthesis, physiological effects, and degradation ==

=== Synthesis ===
Insulin is produced in the [[pancreas]] and the Brockmann body (in some fish), and released when any of several stimuli are detected. These stimuli include ingested protein and glucose in the blood produced from digested food.&lt;ref name=MedicalPhysiology&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rhoades|first1=Rodney A.|last2=Bell|first2=David R.| name-list-format = vanc | title=Medical physiology : principles for clinical medicine|date=2009|publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|location=Philadelphia|isbn=978-0-7817-6852-8|pages=644–47|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Carbohydrate]]s can be polymers of simple sugars or the simple sugars themselves. If the carbohydrates include glucose, then that glucose will be absorbed into the bloodstream and blood glucose level will begin to rise. In target cells, insulin initiates a [[signal transduction]], which has the effect of increasing [[glucose]] uptake and storage. Finally, insulin is degraded, terminating the response.

[[File:Insulin path.svg|thumb|400px|Insulin undergoes extensive posttranslational modification along the production pathway. Production and secretion are largely independent; prepared insulin is stored awaiting secretion. Both C-peptide and mature insulin are biologically active. Cell components and proteins in this image are not to scale.]]

In mammals, insulin is synthesized in the pancreas within the beta cells. One million to three million pancreatic islets form the [[endocrine]] part of the pancreas, which is primarily an [[exocrine]] [[gland]]. The endocrine portion accounts for only 2% of the total mass of the pancreas. Within the pancreatic islets, beta cells constitute 65–80% of all the cells.

Insulin consists of two polypeptide chains, the A- and B- chains, linked together by disulfide bonds. It is however first synthesized as a single polypeptide called [[preproinsulin]] in beta cells. Preproinsulin contains a 24-residue [[signal peptide]] which directs the nascent polypeptide chain to the rough [[endoplasmic reticulum]] (RER).  The signal peptide is cleaved as the polypeptide is translocated into lumen of the RER, forming [[proinsulin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/?id=ohgjG0qAvfgC&amp;pg=PA66#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title= Joslin's Diabetes Mellitus | vauthors = Kahn CR, Weir GC | author-link = C. Ronald Kahn | edition = 14th |pages= |publisher= Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins |year=2005 |isbn=978-8493531836 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the RER the proinsulin folds into the correct conformation and 3 disulfide bonds are formed.  About 5–10 min after its assembly in the endoplasmic reticulum, proinsulin is transported to the trans-Golgi network (TGN) where immature granules are formed. Transport to the TGN may take about 30 min.

Proinsulin undergoes maturation into active insulin through the action of cellular endopeptidases known as [[prohormone convertase]]s ([[Proprotein convertase 1|PC1]] and [[proprotein convertase 2|PC2]]), as well as the exoprotease [[carboxypeptidase E]].&lt;ref name="pmid16591494"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Steiner DF, Oyer PE | title = The biosynthesis of insulin and a probable precursor of insulin by a human islet cell adenoma | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 57 | issue = 2 | pages = 473–80 | date = February 1967 | pmid = 16591494 | pmc = 335530 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.57.2.473 | bibcode = 1967PNAS...57..473S }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The endopeptidases cleave at 2 positions, releasing a fragment called the [[C-peptide]], and leaving 2 peptide chains, the B- and A- chains, linked by 2 disulfide bonds.  The cleavage sites are each located after a pair of basic residues (lysine-64 and arginine-65, and arginine-31 and −32). After cleavage of the C-peptide, these 2 pairs of basic residues are removed by the carboxypeptidase.&lt;ref name="creighton"&gt;{{cite book | first = Thomas E | last = Creighton | name-list-format = vanc | title = Proteins: Structures and Molecular Properties |edition=2nd |pages=81–83 |year=1993 |publisher=W H Freeman and Company |isbn=0-7167-2317-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[C-peptide]] is the central portion of proinsulin, and the primary sequence of proinsulin goes in the order "B-C-A"  (the B and A chains were identified on the basis of mass and the C-peptide was discovered later).

The resulting mature insulin is packaged inside mature granules waiting for metabolic signals (such as leucine, arginine, glucose and mannose) and vagal nerve stimulation to be exocytosed from the cell into the circulation.&lt;ref name = "Najjar_2001"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Najjar S | title = Insulin Action: Molecular Basis of Diabetes | journal = Encyclopedia of Life Sciences | publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons | year=2001 | doi = 10.1038/npg.els.0001402 | isbn = 0470016175 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The endogenous production of insulin is regulated in several steps along the synthesis pathway:
* At [[DNA transcription|transcription]] from the [[insulin gene]]
* In [[mRNA]] stability

Insulin release is stimulated also by beta-2 receptor stimulation and inhibited by alpha-1 receptor stimulation.  In addition, cortisol, glucagon and growth hormone antagonize the actions of insulin during times of stress.  Insulin also inhibits fatty acid release by hormone sensitive lipase in adipose tissue.&lt;ref name="stryer" /&gt;

=== Release ===
{{See also|Blood glucose regulation}}

[[Beta Cell|Beta cells]] in the [[islets of Langerhans]] release insulin in two phases. The first-phase release is rapidly triggered in response to increased blood glucose levels, and lasts about 10 minutes. The second phase is a sustained, slow release of newly formed vesicles triggered independently of sugar, peaking in 2 to 3 hours. Reduced first-phase insulin release may be the earliest detectable beta cell defect predicting onset of [[Diabetes mellitus type 2|type&amp;nbsp;2 diabetes]].&lt;ref name="pmid11815469"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gerich JE | title = Is reduced first-phase insulin release the earliest detectable abnormality in individuals destined to develop type 2 diabetes? | journal = Diabetes | volume = 51 | issue = Suppl 1 | pages = S117–21 | date = February 2002 | pmid = 11815469 | doi = 10.2337/diabetes.51.2007.s117}}&lt;/ref&gt; First-phase release and [[Insulin resistance|insulin sensitivity]] are independent predictors of diabetes.&lt;ref name="pmid20805282"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lorenzo C, Wagenknecht LE, Rewers MJ, Karter AJ, Bergman RN, Hanley AJ, Haffner SM | title = Disposition index, glucose effectiveness, and conversion to type 2 diabetes: the Insulin Resistance Atherosclerosis Study (IRAS) | journal = Diabetes Care | volume = 33 | issue = 9 | pages = 2098–103 | date = September 2010 | pmid = 20805282 | pmc = 2928371 | doi = 10.2337/dc10-0165 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The description of first phase release is as follows:
* Glucose enters the β-cells through the [[glucose transporters]], [[GLUT2]]. These glucose transporters have a relatively low affinity for glucose, ensuring that the rate of glucose entry into the β-cells is proportional to the extracellular glucose concentration (within the physiological range). At low blood sugar levels very little glucose enters the β-cells; at high blood glucose concentrations large quantities of glucose enter these cells.&lt;ref name=schuit&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Schuit F, Moens K, Heimberg H, Pipeleers D | title = Cellular origin of hexokinase in pancreatic islets | journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 274 | issue = 46 | pages = 32803–09 | date = November 1999 | pmid = 10551841 | publication-date = 1999 | doi=10.1074/jbc.274.46.32803}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The glucose that enters the β-cell is phosphorylated to [[glucose-6-phosphate]] (G-6-P) by [[glucokinase]] ([[Hexokinase#Types of mammalian hexokinase|hexokinase IV]]) which is not inhibited by G-6-P in the way that the hexokinases in other tissues (hexokinase I – III) are affected by this product. This means that the intracellular G-6-P concentration remains proportional to the blood sugar concentration.&lt;ref name=koeslag /&gt;&lt;ref name=schuit /&gt;
* Glucose-6-phosphate enters [[Glycolysis|glycolytic pathway]] and then, via the [[pyruvate dehydrogenase]] reaction, into the [[Krebs cycle]], where multiple, high-energy [[adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] molecules are produced by the oxidation of [[acetyl CoA]] (the Krebs cycle substrate), leading to a rise in the ATP:ADP ratio within the cell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Schuit F, De Vos A, Farfari S, Moens K, Pipeleers D, Brun T, Prentki M | title = Metabolic fate of glucose in purified islet cells.

* An increased intracellular ATP:ADP ratio closes the ATP-sensitive SUR1/[[Kir6.2]] [[potassium channel]] (see [[sulfonylurea receptor]]). This prevents potassium ions (K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) from leaving the cell by facilitated diffusion, leading to a buildup of intracellular potassium ions. As a result, the inside of the cell becomes less negative with respect to the outside, leading to the depolarization of the cell surface membrane.
* Upon [[depolarization]], voltage-gated [[calcium channels|calcium ion (Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) channels]] open, allowing calcium ions to move into the cell by facilitated diffusion.
* The cytosolic calcium ion concentration can also be increased by calcium release from intracellular stores via activation of ryanodine receptors.&lt;ref name="SP2015"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Santulli G, Pagano G, Sardu C, Xie W, Reiken S, D'Ascia SL, Cannone M, Marziliano N, Trimarco B, Guise TA, Lacampagne A, Marks AR | title = Calcium release channel RyR2 regulates insulin release and glucose homeostasis | journal = The Journal of Clinical Investigation | volume = 125 | issue = 5 | pages = 1968–78 | date = May 2015 | pmid = 25844899 | doi = 10.1172/JCI79273 | pmc=4463204}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The calcium ion concentration in the cytosol of the beta cells can also, or additionally, be increased through the activation of [[phospholipase|phospholipase C]] resulting from the binding of an extracellular [[ligand]] (hormone or neurotransmitter) to a [[G protein]]-coupled membrane receptor. Phospholipase C cleaves the membrane phospholipid, [[phosphatidyl inositol 4,5-bisphosphate]], into [[inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate]] and [[diglyceride|diacylglycerol]]. Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) then binds to receptor proteins in the plasma membrane of the [[endoplasmic reticulum]] (ER). This allows the release of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ions from the ER via IP3-gated channels, which raises the cytosolic concentration of calcium ions independently of the effects of a high blood glucose concentration. [[Parasympathetic nervous system|Parasympathetic]] stimulation of the pancreatic islets operates via this pathway to increase insulin secretion into the blood.&lt;ref name=stryer1&gt;{{cite book |last1= Stryer |first1= Lubert | name-list-format = vanc | title = Biochemistry. |edition= Fourth |location= New York |publisher= W.H.

* The significantly increased amount of calcium ions in the cells' cytoplasm causes the release into the blood of previously synthesized insulin, which has been stored in intracellular [[secretion|secretory]] [[vesicle (biology)|vesicles]].

This is the primary mechanism for release of insulin. Other substances known to stimulate insulin release include the amino acids arginine and leucine, parasympathetic release of [[acetylcholine]] (acting via the phospholipase C pathway), [[sulfonylurea]], [[cholecystokinin]] (CCK, also via phospholipase C),&lt;ref name="pmid19922535"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cawston EE, Miller LJ | title = Therapeutic potential for novel drugs targeting the type 1 cholecystokinin receptor | journal = British Journal of Pharmacology | volume = 159 | issue = 5 | pages = 1009–21 | date = March 2010 | pmid = 19922535 | pmc = 2839260 | doi = 10.1111/j.1476-5381.2009.00489.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the gastrointestinally derived [[incretins]], such as [[glucagon-like peptide-1]] (GLP-1) and [[glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide]] (GIP).

Release of insulin is strongly inhibited by [[norepinephrine]] (noradrenaline), which leads to increased blood glucose levels during stress.  It appears that release of [[catecholamines]] by the [[sympathetic nervous system]] has conflicting influences on insulin release by beta cells, because insulin release is inhibited by α&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-adrenergic receptors&lt;ref name="pmid6252481"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nakaki T, Nakadate T, Kato R | title = Alpha 2-adrenoceptors modulating insulin release from isolated pancreatic islets | journal = Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Archives of Pharmacology | volume = 313 | issue = 2 | pages = 151–53 | date = August 1980 | pmid = 6252481 | doi = 10.1007/BF00498572 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and stimulated by β&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-adrenergic receptors.&lt;ref name="Layden_2010"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Layden BT, Durai V, ((Lowe WL Jr)) | title = G-Protein-Coupled Receptors, Pancreatic Islets, and Diabetes | journal = Nature Education | volume = 3 | issue = 9 | pages = 13 | year = 2010 | url = http://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/g-protein-coupled-receptors-pancreatic-islets-and-14257267  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The net effect of [[norepinephrine]] from sympathetic nerves and [[epinephrine]] from adrenal glands on insulin release is inhibition due to dominance of the α-adrenergic receptors.&lt;ref name="sabyasachi"&gt;{{cite book  | vauthors = Sircar S | title = Medical Physiology | publisher = Thieme Publishing Group | location = Stuttgart | year = 2007 | pages = 537–38 | isbn = 3-13-144061-9  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the glucose level comes down to the usual physiologic value, insulin release from the β-cells slows or stops. If the blood glucose level drops lower than this, especially to dangerously low levels, release of hyperglycemic hormones (most prominently [[glucagon]] from islet of Langerhans alpha cells) forces release of glucose into the blood from the liver glycogen stores, supplemented by [[gluconeogenesis]] if the glycogen stores become depleted. By increasing blood glucose, the hyperglycemic hormones prevent or correct life-threatening hypoglycemia.

Evidence of impaired first-phase insulin release can be seen in the [[glucose tolerance test]], demonstrated by a substantially elevated blood glucose level at 30 minutes after the ingestion of a glucose load (75 or 100 g of glucose), followed by a slow drop over the next 100 minutes, to remain above 120&amp;nbsp;mg/100 ml after two hours after the start of the test. In a normal person the blood glucose level is corrected (and may even be slightly over-corrected) by the end of the test.

=== Oscillations ===

[[Image:Pancreas insulin oscillations.svg|thumb|250px|Insulin release from pancreas oscillates with a period of 3–6&amp;nbsp;minutes.&lt;ref name="hellman" /&gt;]]

Even during digestion, in general, one or two hours following a meal, insulin release from the pancreas is not continuous, but [[oscillates]] with a period of 3–6&amp;nbsp;minutes, changing from generating a blood insulin concentration more than about 800 [[pico-|p]] [[unit mole|mol]]/l to less than 100 pmol/l.&lt;ref name="hellman"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hellman B, Gylfe E, Grapengiesser E, Dansk H, Salehi A | title = [Insulin oscillations—clinically important rhythm.

=== Signal transduction ===
The effects of insulin are initiated by its binding to a receptor present in the cell membrane. The receptor molecule contains an α- and β subunits. Two molecules are joined to form what is known as a homodimer. Insulin binds to the α-subunits of the homodimer, which faces the extracellular side of the cells. The β subunits have tyrosine kinase enzyme activity which is triggered by the insulin binding. This activity provokes the autophosphorylation of the β subunits and subsequently the phosphorylation of proteins inside the cell known as insulin receptor substrates (IRS). The phosphorylation of the IRS activates a signal transduction cascade that leads to the activation of other kinases as well as transcription factors that mediate the intracellular effects of insulin.&lt;ref name="diabetesincontrol.com"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.diabetesincontrol.com/handbook-of-diabetes-4th-edition-excerpt-4-normal-physiology-of-insulin-secretion-and-action/|title=Handbook of Diabetes, 4th Edition, Excerpt #4: Normal Physiology of Insulin Secretion and Action|date=2014-07-28|work=Diabetes In Control.

The cascade that leads to the insertion of GLUT4 glucose transporters into the cell membranes of muscle and fat cells, and to the synthesis of glycogen in liver and muscle tissue, as well as the conversion of glucose into triglycerides in liver, adipose, and lactating mammary gland tissue, operates via the activation, by IRS-1, of phosphoinositol 3 kinase ([[phosphoinositide 3-kinase|PI3K]]). This enzyme converts a [[phospholipid]] in the cell membrane by the name of  [[phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate]] (PIP2), into [[Phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate|phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate]] (PIP3), which, in turn, activates [[AKT|protein kinase B]] (PKB). Activated PKB facilitates the fusion of GLUT4 containing [[endosome]]s with the cell membrane, resulting in an increase in GLUT4 transporters in the plasma membrane.&lt;ref name="pmid15791206"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = McManus EJ, Sakamoto K, Armit LJ, Ronaldson L, Shpiro N, Marquez R, Alessi DR | title = Role that phosphorylation of GSK3 plays in insulin and Wnt signalling defined by knockin analysis | journal = The EMBO Journal | volume = 24 | issue = 8 | pages = 1571–83 | date = April 2005 | pmid = 15791206 | pmc = 1142569 | doi = 10.1038/sj.emboj.7600633 }}&lt;/ref&gt; PKB also phosphorylates [[GSK-3|glycogen synthase kinase]] (GSK), thereby inactivating this enzyme.&lt;ref name="pmid11035810"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fang X, Yu SX, Lu Y, Bast RC, Woodgett JR, Mills GB | title = Phosphorylation and inactivation of glycogen synthase kinase 3 by protein kinase A | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 97 | issue = 22 | pages = 11960–75 | date = October 2000 | pmid = 11035810 | pmc = 17277 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.220413597 | bibcode = 2000PNAS...9711960F }}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that its substrate, [[glycogen synthase]] (GS), cannot be phosphorylated, and remains dephosphorylated, and therefore active. The active enzyme, glycogen synthase (GS), catalyzes the rate limiting step in the synthesis of glycogen from glucose. Similar dephosphorylations affect the enzymes controlling the rate of [[glycolysis]] leading to the synthesis of fats via [[malonyl-CoA]] in the tissues that can generate [[triglycerides]], and also the enzymes that control the rate of [[gluconeogenesis]] in the liver. The overall effect of these final enzyme dephosphorylations is that, in the tissues that can carry out these reactions, glycogen and fat synthesis from glucose are stimulated, and glucose production by the liver through [[glycogenolysis]] and [[gluconeogenesis]] are inhibited.&lt;ref name="stryer2"&gt;{{cite book|title=Biochemistry.|publisher=W.H.

After the intracellular signal that resulted from the binding of insulin to its receptor has been produced, termination of signaling is then needed.  As mentioned below in the section on degradation, endocytosis and degradation of the receptor bound to insulin is a main mechanism to end signaling.&lt;ref name="Najjar_2001" /&gt;  In addition, the signaling pathway is also terminated by dephosphorylation of the tyrosine residues in the various signaling pathways by tyrosine phosphatases.  Serine/Threonine kinases are also known to reduce the activity of insulin.

=== Physiological effects ===
[[File:Insulin glucose metabolism ZP.svg|thumbnail|400px|'''Effect of insulin on glucose uptake and metabolism.''' Insulin binds to its receptor (1), which starts many protein activation cascades (2). These include translocation of Glut-4 transporter to the [[plasma membrane]] and influx of glucose (3), [[glycogen]] synthesis (4), [[glycolysis]] (5) and triglyceride synthesis (6).]]

[[File:Signal Transduction Diagram- Insulin.svg|thumb|400px|The insulin signal transduction pathway begins when insulin binds to the insulin receptor proteins.

The actions of insulin on the global human metabolism level include:
* Increase of cellular intake of certain substances, most prominently glucose in muscle and [[adipose tissue]] (about two-thirds of body cells)&lt;ref name="pmid21864752"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dimitriadis G, Mitrou P, Lambadiari V, Maratou E, Raptis SA | title = Insulin effects in muscle and adipose tissue | journal = Diabetes Research and Clinical Practice | volume = 93 Suppl 1 | issue =  | pages = S52–59 | date = August 2011 | url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Eirini_Maratou/publication/221930616_Insulin_effects_in_muscle_and_adipose_tissue/links/00b7d527a370a8fd76000000.pdf  | pmid = 21864752 | doi = 10.1016/S0168-8227(11)70014-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Increase of [[DNA replication]] and [[protein synthesis]] via control of amino acid uptake
* Modification of the activity of numerous [[enzymes]].

The actions of insulin (indirect and direct) on cells include:
* '''Stimulates the uptake of glucose''' –  Insulin decreases blood glucose concentration by inducing intake of glucose by the cells. This is possible because Insulin causes the insertion of the GLUT4 transporter in the cell membranes of muscle and fat tissues which allows glucose to enter the cell.&lt;ref name="diabetesincontrol.com"/&gt;
* '''Increased [[Fatty acid metabolism#Glycolytic endy products are used in the conversion of carbohydrates into fatty acids|fat synthesis]]''' – insulin forces fat cells to take in blood glucose, which is converted into [[triglyceride]]s; decrease of insulin causes the reverse.&lt;ref name="pmid21864752" /&gt;
* Increased [[esterification]] of fatty acids – forces adipose tissue to make neutral fats (i.e., [[triglycerides]]) from fatty acids; decrease of insulin causes the reverse.&lt;ref name="pmid21864752" /&gt;
* Decreased [[lipolysis]] – forces reduction in conversion of fat cell lipid stores into blood fatty acids and glycerol; decrease  of insulin causes the reverse.&lt;ref name="pmid21864752" /&gt;
* Induce glycogen synthesis – When glucose levels are high, insulin induces the formation of glycogen by the activation of the hexokinase enzyme, which adds a phosphate group in glucose, thus resulting in a molecule that cannot exit the cell. At the same time, insulin inhibits the enzyme glucose-6-phosphatase, which removes the phosphate group. These two enzymes are key for the formation of glycogen. Also, insulin activates the enzymes phosphofructokinase and glycogen synthase which are responsible for glycogen synthesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vivo.colostate.edu/hbooks/pathphys/endocrine/pancreas/insulin_phys.html|title=Physiologic Effects of Insulin|website=www.vivo.colostate.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Decreased [[gluconeogenesis]] and [[glycogenolysis]] – decreases production of glucose from noncarbohydrate substrates, primarily in the liver (the vast majority of endogenous insulin arriving at the liver never leaves the liver); increase of insulin causes glucose production by the liver from assorted substrates.&lt;ref name="pmid21864752" /&gt;

Insulin also influences other body functions, such as [[compliance (physiology)#Blood vessels|vascular compliance]] and [[cognition]].

=== Degradation ===
Once an insulin molecule has docked onto the receptor and effected its action, it may be released back into the extracellular environment, or it may be degraded by the cell. The two primary sites for insulin clearance are the liver and the kidney. The liver clears most insulin during first-pass transit, whereas the kidney clears most of the insulin in systemic circulation. Degradation normally involves [[endocytosis]] of the insulin-receptor complex, followed by the action of [[insulin-degrading enzyme]]. An insulin molecule produced endogenously by the beta cells is estimated to be degraded within about one hour after its initial release into circulation (insulin [[biological half-life|half-life]] ~ 4–6&amp;nbsp;minutes).&lt;ref name="pmid"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Duckworth WC, Bennett RG, Hamel FG | title = Insulin degradation: progress and potential | journal = Endocrine Reviews | volume = 19 | issue = 5 | pages = 608–24 | date = October 1998 | pmid = 9793760 | doi = 10.1210/er.19.5.608 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="urlCarbohydrate and insulin metabolism in chronic kidney disease"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.uptodate.com/contents/carbohydrate-and-insulin-metabolism-in-chronic-kidney-disease | title = Carbohydrate and insulin metabolism in chronic kidney disease |vauthors=Palmer BF, Henrich WL | work = UpToDate, Inc }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Regulator of endocannabinoid metabolism ===
Insulin is a major regulator of [[Endocannabinoids|endocannabinoid]] (EC) [[metabolism]] and insulin treatment has been shown to reduce [[intracellular]] ECs, the [[2-Arachidonoylglycerol|2-arachidonylglycerol]] (2-AG) and [[anandamide]] (AEA), which correspond with insulin-sensitive expression changes in enzymes of EC metabolism. In insulin-resistant [[adipocyte]]s, patterns of insulin-induced enzyme expression is disturbed in a manner consistent with elevated EC [[Biosynthesis|synthesis]] and reduced EC degradation. Findings suggest that [[Insulin resistance|insulin-resistant]] adipocytes fail to regulate EC metabolism and decrease intracellular EC levels in response to insulin stimulation, whereby [[Obesity|obese]] insulin-resistant individuals exhibit increased concentrations of ECs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = D'Eon TM, Pierce KA, Roix JJ, Tyler A, Chen H, Teixeira SR | title = The role of adipocyte insulin resistance in the pathogenesis of obesity-related elevations in endocannabinoids | language = en | journal = Diabetes | volume = 57 | issue = 5 | pages = 1262–68 | date = May 2008 | pmid = 18276766 | doi = 10.2337/db07-1186 | url = http://diabetes.diabetesjournals.org/content/57/5/1262 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid26374449"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gatta-Cherifi B, Cota D | title = New insights on the role of the endocannabinoid system in the regulation of energy balance | journal = International Journal of Obesity | volume = 40 | issue = 2 | pages = 210–19 | date = February 2016 | pmid = 26374449 | doi = 10.1038/ijo.2015.179 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This dysregulation contributes to excessive [[Adipose tissue|visceral fat]] accumulation and reduced [[adiponectin]] release from abdominal adipose tissue, and further to the onset of several cardiometabolic risk factors that are associated with obesity and [[Diabetes mellitus type 2|type 2 diabetes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Di Marzo V | title = The endocannabinoid system in obesity and type 2 diabetes | journal = Diabetologia | volume = 51 | issue = 8 | pages = 1356–67 | date = August 2008 | pmid = 18563385 | doi = 10.1007/s00125-008-1048-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Hypoglycemia}}
[[Hypoglycemia]], also known as "low blood sugar", is when [[blood sugar]] decreases to below normal levels.&lt;ref name=NIH2008/&gt; This may result in a variety of [[symptoms]] including clumsiness, trouble talking, confusion, [[loss of consciousness]], [[seizures]] or death.&lt;ref name=NIH2008/&gt; A feeling of hunger, sweating, shakiness and weakness may also be present.&lt;ref name=NIH2008/&gt; Symptoms typically come on quickly.&lt;ref name=NIH2008&gt;{{cite web|title=Hypoglycemia|url=http://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/health-topics/Diabetes/hypoglycemia/Pages/index.aspx|website=National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases|accessdate=28 June 2015|date=October 2008|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150701034430/http://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/health-topics/Diabetes/hypoglycemia/Pages/index.aspx|archivedate=1 July 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Diseases and syndromes ==
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2018}}
There are several conditions in which insulin disturbance is pathologic:
* [[Diabetes mellitus]] – general term referring to all states characterized by hyperglycemia
** [[Diabetes mellitus type 1|Type 1]] – autoimmune-mediated destruction of insulin-producing β-cells in the pancreas, resulting in absolute insulin deficiency
** [[Diabetes mellitus type 2|Type 2]] – either inadequate insulin production by the β-cells or [[insulin resistance]] or both because of reasons not completely understood.
*** there is correlation with [[Diet (nutrition)|diet]], with sedentary lifestyle, with [[obesity]], with age and with [[metabolic syndrome]]. Causality has been demonstrated in multiple model organisms including mice and monkeys; Importantly, non-obese people do get Type 2 diabetes due to diet, sedentary lifestyle and unknown risk factors.
*** it is likely that there is genetic susceptibility to develop Type 2 diabetes under certain environmental conditions
** Other types of impaired glucose tolerance (see the [[Diabetes]])
* [[Insulinoma]] – a tumor of beta cells producing excess insulin or [[reactive hypoglycemia]].
* [[Metabolic syndrome]] – a poorly understood condition first called Syndrome X by [[Gerald Reaven]]. It is currently not clear whether the syndrome has a single, treatable cause, or is the result of body changes leading to type 2 diabetes. It is characterized by elevated blood pressure, dyslipidemia (disturbances in blood cholesterol forms and other blood lipids), and increased waist circumference (at least in populations in much of the developed world). The basic underlying cause may be the insulin resistance that precedes type 2 diabetes, which is a diminished capacity for [[Insulin#Physiological effects|insulin response]] in some tissues (e.g., muscle, fat). It is common for morbidities such as essential [[hypertension]], [[obesity]], type 2 diabetes, and [[cardiovascular disease]] (CVD) to develop.
* [[Polycystic ovary syndrome]] – a complex syndrome in women in the reproductive years where [[anovulation]] and [[androgen]] excess are commonly displayed as [[hirsutism]]. In many cases of PCOS, insulin resistance is present.

Several analogs of human insulin are available. These insulin analogs are closely related to the human insulin structure, and were developed for specific aspects of glycemic control in terms of fast action (prandial insulins) and long action (basal insulins).&lt;ref&gt;[[Insulin analog]]&lt;/ref&gt; The first biosynthetic insulin analog was developed for clinical use at mealtime (prandial insulin), [[Humalog]] (insulin lispro),{{citation needed|reason=Humulin first introduced in 1982 per humulin.com, I don't have any peer-reviewed lit though|date=April 2015}} it is more rapidly absorbed after subcutaneous injection than regular insulin, with an effect 15&amp;nbsp;minutes after injection. Other rapid-acting analogues are [[NovoRapid]] and [[Apidra]], with similar profiles. All are rapidly absorbed due to amino acid sequences that will reduce formation of dimers and hexamers (monomeric insulins are more rapidly absorbed). Fast acting insulins do not require the injection-to-meal interval previously recommended for human insulin and animal insulins. The other type is long acting insulin; the first of these was [[Lantus]] (insulin glargine). These have a steady effect for an extended period from 18 to 24&amp;nbsp;hours. Likewise, another protracted insulin analogue ([[Levemir]]) is based on a fatty acid acylation approach. A [[myristic acid]] molecule is attached to this analogue, which associates the insulin molecule to the abundant serum albumin, which in turn extends the effect and reduces the risk of hypoglycemia. Both protracted analogues need to be taken only once daily, and are used for type 1 diabetics as the basal insulin. A combination of a rapid acting and a protracted insulin is also available, making it more likely for patients to achieve an insulin profile that mimics that of the body´s own insulin release.

Insulin is usually taken as [[subcutaneous injection]]s by single-use [[syringe]]s with [[hypodermic needle|needles]], via an [[insulin pump]], or by repeated-use [[insulin pen]]s with disposable needles. [[Inhaled insulin]] is also available in the U.S. market now.

Synthetic insulin can trigger adverse effects, so some people with diabetes rely on animal-source insulin.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iddt.org/diabetic-commonsense/the-great-debate-natural-animal-or-artificial-human-insulin&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike many medicines, insulin currently cannot be taken orally because, like nearly all other proteins introduced into the [[Human gastrointestinal tract|gastrointestinal tract]], it is reduced to fragments, whereupon all activity is lost. There has been some research into ways to protect insulin from the digestive tract, so that it can be administered orally or sublingually.&lt;ref name="pmid27364922"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wong CY, Martinez J, Dass CR | title = Oral delivery of insulin for treatment of diabetes: status quo, challenges and opportunities | journal = The Journal of Pharmacy and Pharmacology | volume = 68 | issue = 9 | pages = 1093–108 | year = 2016 | pmid = 27364922 | doi = 10.1111/jphp.12607 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid27014614"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Shah RB, Patel M, Maahs DM, Shah VN | title = Insulin delivery methods: Past, present and future | journal = International Journal of Pharmaceutical Investigation | volume = 6 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–9 | year = 2016 | pmid = 27014614 | pmc = 4787057 | doi = 10.4103/2230-973X.176456 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of study ==

=== Discovery ===
In 1869, while studying the structure of the [[pancreas]] under a [[microscope]], [[Paul Langerhans]], a medical student in [[Berlin]], identified some previously unnoticed tissue clumps scattered throughout the bulk of the pancreas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sakula|first=A|title=Paul Langerhans (1847–1888): a centenary tribute|journal=Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine|date=July 1988|volume=81|pmc=1291675|pmid=3045317|issue=7|pages=414–15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The function of the "little heaps of cells", later [[eponym|known as]] the ''[[islets of Langerhans]]'', initially remained unknown, but [[Édouard Laguesse]] later suggested they might produce secretions that play a regulatory role in digestion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://musee.chru-lille.fr/Memoire/Medecins/48029.html |title=Edouard Laguesse (1861–1927) |last=Petit |first=Henri |language=fr |website=Museum of the Regional Hospital of Lille |access-date=2018-07-25 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paul Langerhans' son, Archibald, also helped to understand this regulatory role. The term "insulin" originates from ''insula'', the Latin word for islet/island.

In 1889, the physician [[Oskar Minkowski]], in collaboration with [[Joseph von Mering]], removed the pancreas from a healthy dog to test its assumed role in digestion. On testing the urine, they found sugar, establishing for the first time a relationship between the pancreas and diabetes. In 1901, another major step was taken by the American physician and scientist [[Eugene Lindsay Opie]], when he isolated the role of the pancreas to the islets of Langerhans: "Diabetes mellitus when the result of a lesion of the pancreas is caused by destruction of the islands of Langerhans and occurs only when these bodies are in part or wholly destroyed".&lt;ref name="Johns Hopkins Hosp. Bull. p.264)"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Opie EL | title = Diabetes Mellitus Associated with Hyaline Degeneration of the islands of Langerhans of the Pancreas | journal = Bulletin of the Johns Hopkins Hospital | volume = 12 | issue = 125 | pages = 263–64 | year = 1901 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="J.

Over the next two decades researchers made several attempts to isolate the islets' secretions. In 1906 [[George Ludwig Zuelzer]] achieved partial success in treating dogs with pancreatic extract, but he was unable to continue his work. Between 1911 and 1912, E.L. Scott at the [[University of Chicago]] tried aqueous pancreatic extracts and noted "a slight diminution of glycosuria", but was unable to convince his director of his work's value; it was shut down. [[Israel Kleiner (biochemist)|Israel Kleiner]] demonstrated similar effects at [[Rockefeller University]] in 1915, but [[World War I]] interrupted his work and he did not return to it.&lt;ref name="J. Nutrition 92"&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://jn.nutrition.org/cgi/reprint/92/4/507.pdf | author = The American Institute of Nutrition |title=Proceedings of the Thirty-first Annual Meeting of the American Institute of Nutrition | journal = Journal of Nutrition | volume = 92 | year = 1967 | page = 509 | format = PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1916, [[Nicolae Paulescu]] developed an [[aqueous]] [[Pancreas|pancreatic]] extract which, when injected into a [[Diabetes|diabetic]] dog, had a normalizing effect on [[blood sugar|blood-sugar]] levels. He had to interrupt his experiments because of [[World War I]], and in 1921 he wrote four papers about his work carried out in [[Bucharest]] and his tests on a diabetic dog. Later that year, he published "Research on the Role of the [[Pancreas]] in Food Assimilation".&lt;ref name="nrjs"&gt;{{Cite journal | author = Paulesco NC | journal = Archives Internationales de Physiologie | title= Recherche sur le rôle du pancréas dans l'assimilation nutritive|volume= 17|issue=|pages= 85–103| date=August 31, 1921 }}

&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Extraction and purification ===

In October 1920, Canadian [[Frederick Banting]] concluded that the digestive secretions that Minkowski had originally studied were breaking down the islet secretion, thereby making it impossible to extract successfully. A surgeon by training, Banting knew certain arteries could be tied off that would lead most of the pancreas to atrophy, while leaving the islets of Langerhans intact. He reasoned that a relatively pure extract could be made from the islets once most of the rest of the pancreas was gone. He jotted a note to himself: "Ligate pancreatic ducts of the dog. Keep dogs alive till acini degenerate leaving islets. Try to isolate internal secretion of these and relieve glycosuria."&lt;ref name="rosenfeld2002"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rosenfeld L | title = Insulin: discovery and controversy | journal = Clinical Chemistry | volume = 48 | issue = 12 | pages = 2270–88 | date = December 2002 | pmid = 12446492 | url = http://clinchem.aaccjnls.org/content/48/12/2270 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the spring of 1921, Banting traveled to [[Toronto]] to explain his idea to [[John James Rickard Macleod|J.J.R. Macleod]], Professor of Physiology at the [[University of Toronto]]. Macleod was initially skeptical, since Banting had no background in research and was not familiar with the latest literature, but he agreed to provide lab space for Banting to test out his ideas. Macleod also arranged for two undergraduates to be Banting's lab assistants that summer, but Banting required only one lab assistant. [[Charles Herbert Best|Charles Best]] and Clark Noble flipped a coin; Best won the coin toss and took the first shift. This proved unfortunate for Noble, as Banting kept Best for the entire summer and eventually shared half his Nobel Prize money and credit for the discovery with Best.&lt;ref name="pmid12473641"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wright JR | title = Almost famous: E. Clark Noble, the common thread in the discovery of insulin and vinblastine | journal = CMAJ | volume = 167 | issue = 12 | pages = 1391–96 | date = December 2002 | pmid = 12473641 | pmc = 137361 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 30 July 1921, Banting and Best successfully isolated an extract ("isleton") from the islets of a duct-tied dog and injected it into a diabetic dog, finding that the extract reduced its blood sugar by 40% in 1 hour.&lt;ref name="Krishnamurthy2002"&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Krishnamurthy K | title = Pioneers in scientific discoveries | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=dAXYzzDL_9oC&amp;pg=PA266 | accessdate = 26 July 2011 | year = 2002 | publisher = Mittal Publications | isbn = 978-81-7099-844-0 | page=266 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rosenfeld2002"/&gt;

Banting and Best presented their results to Macleod on his return to Toronto in the fall of 1921, but Macleod pointed out flaws with the experimental design, and suggested the experiments be repeated with more dogs and better equipment. He moved Banting and Best into a better laboratory and began paying Banting a salary from his research grants. Several weeks later, the second round of experiments was also a success, and Macleod helped publish their results privately in Toronto that November. Bottlenecked by the time-consuming task of duct-tying dogs and waiting several weeks to extract insulin, Banting hit upon the idea of extracting insulin from the fetal calf pancreas, which had not yet developed digestive glands. By December, they had also succeeded in extracting insulin from the adult cow pancreas. Macleod discontinued all other research in his laboratory to concentrate on the purification of insulin. He invited biochemist [[James Collip]] to help with this task, and the team felt ready for a clinical test within a month.&lt;ref name="rosenfeld2002"/&gt;

On January 11, 1922, [[Leonard Thompson (diabetic)|Leonard Thompson]], a 14-year-old diabetic who lay dying at the [[Toronto General Hospital]], was given the first injection of insulin.&lt;ref name="pmid8409364"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bliss M | title = Rewriting medical history: Charles Best and the Banting and Best myth | journal = Journal of the History of Medicine and Allied Sciences | volume = 48 | issue = 3 | pages = 253–74 | date = July 1993 | pmid = 8409364 | doi = 10.1093/jhmas/48.3.253 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the extract was so impure that Thompson suffered a severe [[anaphylaxis|allergic reaction]], and further injections were cancelled. Over the next 12&amp;nbsp;days, Collip worked day and night to improve the ox-pancreas extract. A second dose was injected on January 23, completely eliminating the [[glycosuria]] that was typical of diabetes without causing any obvious side-effects. The first American patient was [[Elizabeth Hughes Gossett|Elizabeth Hughes]], the daughter of U.S. Secretary of State [[Charles Evans Hughes]].&lt;ref name=miracle&gt;{{cite news |author = Zuger A | title = Rediscovering the First Miracle Drug | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/05/health/05insulin.html?_r=1&amp;hp=&amp;pagewanted=all | quote = Elizabeth Hughes was a cheerful, pretty little girl, five feet tall, with straight brown hair and a consuming interest in birds.

By then she had survived three years, far longer than expected. And then her mother heard the news: Insulin had finally been isolated in Canada. |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=October 4, 2010 |accessdate=2010-10-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first patient treated in the U.S. was future woodcut artist [[James D.

Banting and Best never worked well with Collip, regarding him as something of an interloper, and Collip left the project soon after. Over the spring of 1922, Best managed to improve his techniques to the point where large quantities of insulin could be extracted on demand, but the preparation remained impure. The drug firm [[Eli Lilly and Company]] had offered assistance not long after the first publications in 1921, and they took Lilly up on the offer in April. In November, Lilly's head chemist, [[George B. Walden]] discovered [[Protein precipitation#Isoelectric precipitation|isoelectric precipitation]] and was able to produce large quantities of highly refined insulin. Shortly thereafter, insulin was offered for sale to the general public.

=== Synthesis ===

Purified animal-sourced insulin was initially the only type of insulin available to diabetics. The amino acid structure of insulin was characterized in the early 1950s by [[Frederick Sanger#Sequencing insulin|Frederick Sanger]],&lt;ref name="Stretton_2002"/&gt; and the first synthetic insulin was produced simultaneously in the labs of [[Panayotis Katsoyannis]] at the [[University of Pittsburgh]] and [[Helmut Zahn]] at [[RWTH Aachen University]] in the early 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Costin GE | title = What is the advantage of having melanin in parts of the central nervous system (e.g. substantia nigra)? | journal = IUBMB Life | volume = 56 | issue = 1 | pages = 47–49 | date = January 2004 | pmid = 14992380 | doi = 10.1080/15216540310001659029 | publisher = Time Inc. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="isbn1-4020-0655-1"&gt;{{cite book |vauthors = Wollmer A, Dieken ML, Federwisch M, De Meyts P | title = Insulin &amp; related proteins structure to function and pharmacology | publisher = Kluwer Academic Publishers | location = Boston | year = 2002 | pages = | isbn = 1-4020-0655-1 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=Ula72_FSwy8C&amp;lpg=PP11&amp;dq=Panayotis%20Katsoyannis&amp;pg=PP11#v=onepage&amp;q=Panayotis%20Katsoyannis }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Synthetic crystalline bovine insulin]] was achieved by Chinese researchers in 1965.&lt;ref name=Zou2015&gt;{{cite journal|author=邹承鲁 ([[Zou Chenglu|Chenglu Zou]])|title=对人工合成结晶牛胰岛素的回忆 (Memory on the research of synthesizing bovine insulin)|journal=生命科学(Chinese Bulletin of Life Science)|year=2015|volume=27|issue=6|language=Simplified Chinese|pages=777–79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first genetically engineered, synthetic "human" insulin was produced using [[Escherichia coli|''E. coli'']] in 1978 by [[Arthur Riggs (geneticist)|Arthur Riggs]] and [[Keiichi Itakura]] at the [[Beckman Research Institute]] of the [[City of Hope National Medical Center|City of Hope]] in collaboration with [[Herbert Boyer]] at [[Genentech]].&lt;ref name="urlGenentech" /&gt;&lt;ref name="urlRecombinant DNA technology in the synthesis of human insulin" /&gt; Genentech, founded by Swanson, Boyer and [[Eli Lilly and Company]], went on in 1982 to sell the first commercially available biosynthetic human insulin under the brand name [[Humulin]].&lt;ref name="urlRecombinant DNA technology in the synthesis of human insulin"/&gt; The vast majority of insulin currently used worldwide is now biosynthetic recombinant "human" insulin or its analogues.&lt;ref name="pmid23222785" /&gt;

Recombinant insulin is produced either in yeast (usually ''[[baker's yeast|Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'') or ''E. coli''.&lt;ref name="pmid11030562"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kjeldsen T | title = Yeast secretory expression of insulin precursors | journal = Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology | volume = 54 | issue = 3 | pages = 277–86 | date = September 2000 | pmid = 11030562 | doi = 10.1007/s002530000402 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In yeast, insulin may be engineered as a single-chain protein with a KexII endoprotease (a yeast homolog of PCI/PCII) site that separates the insulin A chain from a c-terminally truncated insulin B chain.  A chemically synthesized c-terminal tail is then grafted onto insulin by reverse proteolysis using the inexpensive protease trypsin; typically the lysine on the c-terminal tail is protected with a chemical protecting group to prevent proteolysis.  The ease of modular synthesis and the relative safety of modifications in that region accounts for common insulin analogs with c-terminal modifications (e.g. lispro, aspart, glulisine).  The Genentech synthesis and completely chemical synthesis such as that by [[Bruce Merrifield]] are not preferred because the efficiency of recombining the two insulin chains is low, primarily due to competition with the precipitation of insulin B chain.

=== Nobel Prizes ===

[[File:C. H. Best and F. G. Banting ca. 1924.png|thumb|[[Frederick Banting]] (right) joined by [[Charles Herbert Best|Charles Best]] 1924]]

The [[Nobel Prize]] committee in 1923 credited the practical extraction of insulin to a team at the [[University of Toronto]] and awarded the Nobel Prize to two men: [[Frederick Banting]] and [[John James Rickard Macleod|J.J.R. Macleod]].&lt;ref name="urlThe Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1923"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1923/ | title = The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1923 | publisher = The Nobel Foundation }}&lt;/ref&gt; They were awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] in 1923 for the discovery of insulin. Banting, insisted that Best was not mentioned, shared his prize with him, and Macleod immediately shared his with [[James Collip]]. The patent for insulin was sold to the [[University of Toronto]] for one dollar.

Two other Nobel Prizes have been awarded for work on insulin. British molecular biologist [[Frederick Sanger]] determined the [[primary structure]] of insulin in 1955, making it the first protein to be sequenced.&lt;ref name="Stretton_2002"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Stretton AO | title = The first sequence. Fred Sanger and insulin | journal = Genetics | volume = 162 | issue = 2 | pages = 527–32 | date = October 2002 | pmid = 12399368 | pmc = 1462286 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sanger was awarded the 1958 [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] for this work. [[Rosalyn Sussman Yalow]] received the 1977 Nobel Prize in Medicine for the development of the [[radioimmunoassay]] for insulin.

Several Nobel Prizes also have an indirect connection with insulin. [[George Minot]], co-recipient of the 1934 Nobel Prize for the development of the first effective treatment for [[pernicious anemia]], had [[diabetes mellitus]].  Dr. [[William Bosworth Castle|William Castle]] observed that the 1921 discovery of insulin, arriving in time to keep Minot alive, was therefore also responsible for the discovery of a cure for [[pernicious anemia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Castle WB | title = The Gordon Wilson Lecture. A Century of Curiosity About Pernicious Anemia | journal = Transactions of the American Clinical and Climatological Association | volume = 73 | pages = 54–80 | year = 1962 | pmid = 21408623 | pmc = 2249021 | authorlink = William Bosworth Castle }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dorothy Hodgkin]] was awarded a Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1964 for the development of [[crystallography]]. In 1969, after decades of work, Hodgkin determined the spatial conformation of insulin, the so-called [[tertiary structure]], by means of [[X-ray diffraction]] studies.

==== Controversy ====
[[Image:Nicolae Paulescu - Foto03.jpg|thumb|100px|[[Nicolae Paulescu]]]]

The work published by Banting, Best, Collip and Macleod represented the preparation of purified insulin extract suitable for use on human patients.&lt;ref name="pmid20314060"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Banting FG, Best CH, Collip JB, Campbell WR, Fletcher AA | title = Pancreatic Extracts in the Treatment of Diabetes Mellitus | journal = Canadian Medical Association Journal | volume = 12 | issue = 3 | pages = 141–46 | date = March 1922 | pmid = 20314060 | pmc = 1524425 | doi =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Paulescu discovered the principles of the treatment, his saline extract could not be used on humans; he was not mentioned in the 1923 Nobel Prize. Professor Ian Murray was particularly active in working to correct "the historical wrong" against [[Nicolae Paulescu]]. Murray was a professor of physiology at the Anderson College of Medicine in [[Glasgow]], [[Scotland]], the head of the department of Metabolic Diseases at a leading Glasgow hospital, vice-president of the British Association of Diabetes, and a founding member of the [[International Diabetes Federation]]. Murray wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Insufficient recognition has been given to Paulescu, the distinguished [[Romania]]n scientist, who at the time when the Toronto team were commencing their research had already succeeded in extracting the antidiabetic hormone of the pancreas and proving its efficacy in reducing the hyperglycaemia in diabetic dogs.&lt;ref name="pmid4560502"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Drury MI | title = The golden jubile of insulin | journal = Journal of the Irish Medical Association | volume = 65 | issue = 14 | pages = 355–63 | date = July 1972 | pmid = 4560502 | doi =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In a private communication, Professor [[Arne Tiselius]], former head of the Nobel Institute, expressed his personal opinion that Paulescu was equally worthy of the award in 1923.&lt;ref name="pmid4930788"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Murray I | title = Paulesco and the isolation of insulin | journal = Journal of the History of Medicine and Allied Sciences | volume = 26 | issue = 2 | pages = 150–57 | date = April 1971 | pmid = 4930788 | doi = 10.1093/jhmas/XXVI.2.150 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Circum-Arctic Map of Permafrost and Ground Ice Conditions.png|thumb|Extent of permafrost in the [[Northern Hemisphere]].]]
The '''International Permafrost Association''' ('''IPA'''), founded in 1983, has as its objectives to foster the dissemination of knowledge concerning [[permafrost]] and to promote cooperation among persons and national or international organisations engaged in scientific investigation and engineering work related to permafrost and seasonally frozen ground. The IPA became an Affiliated Organisation of the [[International Union of Geological Sciences]] in July 1989.

[[Permafrost]] or perennially frozen ground is defined as earth material that remains at or below 0&amp;nbsp;°C for at least two consecutive years. As such, upwards of 25% of Planet Earth is underlain to some degree by permafrost and in extreme conditions reaches depths of 1500 meters. Permafrost occurs in the high latitudes and mountains and plateaus of both hemispheres.

==Objectives==
The Association’s primary responsibilities are to convene International Permafrost Conferences, undertake special projects such as preparing databases, maps, bibliographies, and glossaries, and coordinate international field programmes and networks. International conferences were held at: West Lafayette, Indiana, U.S.A. (1963); Yakutsk, Siberia (1973); Edmonton, Canada (1978); Fairbanks, Alaska (1983); Trondheim, Norway (1988); Beijing, China (1993); Yellowknife, Canada (1998); and Zurich, Switzerland (2003: ICOP 2003). The Ninth International Conference on Permafrost (NICOP) was held in [[University of Alaska Fairbanks|Fairbanks]], Alaska, June 29-July 3, 2008 and the Tenth took place in Salekhard, Russia, June 25–29, 2012 (TICOP 2012). The Eleventh International Conference on Permafrost will be held in Potsdam, Germany in 2016. Field excursions are an integral part of each Conference, and are organised by the host country. Regional conferences are organised between the main conferences (in Europe, Russia, China).

==Organization and structure==
Membership is through adhering national or multinational organisations or as Associate Members in countries where no Adhering Body exists. The IPA is governed by an Executive Committee and a Council consisting of representatives from 26 Adhering Bodies having interests in some aspect of theoretical, basic and applied frozen ground research, including [[permafrost]], [[periglacial]] phenomena, seasonal frost, and artificial [[ground freezing]]. Members are: Argentina, Austria, Canada, China, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Iceland, Italy, Japan, Kyrgyzstan, Mongolia, The Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russia, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom, United States of America. News from the IPA members are posted on the IPA webpage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://ipa.arcticportal.org/publications/frozen-ground |title=Frozen Ground, the News Bulletin of the IPA |language= |website=International Permafrost Association |date= |accessdate=2016-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The officers of the seven-member Executive Committee (2012–2016) are:

:President: Prof. Antoni Lewkowicz (Canada)

:Vice Presidents: Prof. Hanne Christiansen (Norway) and Prof. Vladimir Romanovsky (USA)

:Members: Dr. Hugues Lantuit (Germany), Prof. Lothar Schrott (Austria), Dr. Dmitry Sergeev (Russia) and Prof. Ma Wei (China)

The Executive Director is Dr. Inga May (Germany).

The IPA Constitution provides for three categories of Working Group Parties: standing committees (long-term), working groups (5–10 years) and action groups (1–2 years) that organise and coordinate research activities and special projects. The first category includes a Standing Committee for Data, Information and Communication, an International Advisory Committee for the International Permafrost Conferences, and a Standing Committee for Education and Outreach. There are ten Working Groups, each with two co-chairs and some with subgroups. These are:

The International Secretariat is based at the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research under the direction of Dr. Inga May (Germany). Annual membership contributions are used for producing and distributing ''Frozen Ground'', and support of Working Parties and committee activities and representations at international meetings.

==Publication and Information==
Proceedings of peer-reviewed papers are produced for each International Permafrost Conference by the host country, as are field trip guidebooks. A list of publications is found on the IPA website.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://ipa.arcticportal.org/publications |title=Publications |language= |website=International Permafrost Association |date= |accessdate=2016-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The News Bulletin [http://ipa.arcticportal.org/index.php/publications/frozen-ground.html ''Frozen Ground''] is published annually and has a distribution of over 2500. Current and back issues are posted online.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

The [http://nsidc.org/data/ggd318.html Circum-Arctic Map of Permafrost and Ground-Ice Conditions] at a scale of 1:10,000,000 was prepared by an international team and published in the Circum-Pacific map series in 1997.

The [http://nsidc.org/data/g01175.html CAPS: Circumpolar Active-Layer Permafrost System], version 2.0 CD-ROM is a compilation of global frozen ground data and information.

[http://nsidc.org/pubs/gd/Glaciological_Data_31.pdf Permafrost and Frozen Ground: Bibliography 1978 – 2003], Glaciological Data Report GD-31, is an online bibliography of the world’s literature. Both are produced in conjunction with the International Permafrost Conferences and available from the National Snow and Ice Data Center.

An illustrated [http://nsidc.org/fgdc/glossary/ Glossary of Permafrost and Related Ground-Ice Terms] in 12 languages (Chinese, English, French, German, Icelandic, Italian, Norwegian, Polish, Romanian, Russian, Swedish, and Spanish), 278 pages, was produced in 1998.

IPA cooperates with the [http://www.agiweb.org/ American Geological Institute] by providing literature to its Cold Regions Bibliography Project.

==Major activities==
The IPA coordinates and cooperates with several other major international programmes and organizations. Briefly these are:

[[Global Terrestrial Network for Permafrost|Global Terrestrial Network for Permafrost (GTN-P)]] is a WMO network for monitoring of the active layer and the [http://www.ipy.org/development/eoi/proposal-details.php?id=50 Thermal State of Permafrost (TSP).] The IPA manages the [http://gsc.nrcan.gc.ca/permafrost/gtnp/ GTN-P.] The [http://www.udel.edu/Geography/calm/ Circumpolar Active Layer Monitoring (CALM)] program has 125 reporting stations and [http://www.ipy.org/development/eoi/proposal-details.php?id=50 TSP] has identified over 800 boreholes; both include a total of over 15 participating countries.

[http://www.awi-potsdam.de/acd/ Arctic Coastal Dynamics (ACD)] is a joint programme with the [http://www.iasc.se/ International Arctic Science Committee (IASC)] and the [http://www.igbp.kva.se/cgi-bin/php/frameset.php IGBP](International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme) - [http://www.loicz.org/ LOICZ] (Land-Ocean Interactions in the Coastal Zone) programme to estimate the organic carbon content and mineral transfer for eroding permafrost onto the Arctic shelves. The IPA is collaborating with the [https://web.archive.org/web/20100623011144/http://www.inqua.tcd.ie/ International Union for Quaternary Research (INQUA)].

The IPA has a Memorandum of Understanding with the [http://clic.npolar.no/ Climate and Cryosphere (CliC)] programme of the [http://www.wmo.ch/web/wcrp/wcrp-home.html World Climate Research Programme (WCRP).] The main areas of cooperation are on the roles of permafrost on water and carbon balances, and [[data assimilation]] and modelling.

Beginning in 1995 the IPA and the [http://www.igu-net.org/ International Geographical Union (IGU)] developed an Agreement of Cooperation, thus making IPA an affiliate of the [http://www.igu-net.org/ IGU]. The current IGU collaboration is within its [http://www.geogr.uni-jena.de/cre/index.html Commission on Cold Regions Environments.]

The '''Kanzelhoehe Solar Observatory''' or KSO is an [[astronomy|astronomical]] [[observatory]] affiliated with the Institute of Geophysics, Astrophysics and Meteorology out of the [[University of Graz]]. It is located near [[Villach]] on the southern border of [[Austria]].

Its Web page at http://www.kso.ac.at/ usually posts current images of the sun, especially in the hydrogen-alpha line that is the strongest visible-light line of hydrogen and that reveals the solar chromosphere.

==History==
Founded in 1941 by the German [[Luftwaffe]] to research the effects of the Sun on the Earth's [[ionosphere]], the KSO focuses on multispectral synoptic observations of the sun using several telescope on the same mount.

[[Image:Northwoods 1.jpg|right|thumb|225px|Sunset  on a northern Minnesota lake.]]

The  '''Laurentian Mixed Forest Province''', also  known as the '''North  Woods''', is a [[forest]]ed [[ecoregion]] in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]]. Among others, this terminology has been adopted by the [[Minnesota Department of Natural Resources]].  Similar, though not necessarily entirely identical regions, are identified by the United States Environmental Protection Agency as [[Northern Lakes and Forests (ecoregion)|Northern Lakes and Forests]], and by the World Wildlife Fund by regions such as the [[Western Great Lakes forests]] and [[Eastern forest-boreal transition]].

==Geography==
In the United States, it consists of a broad region of northern [[Minnesota]], [[Wisconsin]] and [[Michigan]] ([[Northern Michigan]] and the [[Upper Peninsula]]) and the forested  areas of [[New England]]. In Canada, it is found in [[Ontario]] around the [[Great Lakes]] and the [[Saint Lawrence River]] through [[Quebec]] to [[Quebec City]].

Nearly all of the region was covered by glaciers during the last [[Ice age]], which created many lakes and wetlands throughout the region.  The poor soils and cool climate in this region were not conducive to farming for early settlers, which resulted in the regrowth of most of the forest after being cleared during the 19th and early 20th centuries.  With the abundant lakes and streams and regrowth of the forests, the region became a major tourist and recreation area for the larger population centers just to the south.

==Ecology==
[[File:USDA Hardiness zone map detail for northeast US.jpg|thumb|1990 USDA Hardiness zone map detail for the northeast US. Zone 3a is light orange, zone 4b is light lavender.]]

The area  is a [[Temperate broadleaf and mixed forests]] [[biome]] transition zone between the true [[boreal forest]]  to the north and the [[Big Woods]] and [[Carolinian forest]] to the south, with characteristics of each.  It has areas of both  broadleaf and [[coniferous|conifer]]  [[forest cover]], and bodies of water ranging from lakes to conifer bogs  and swamps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Laurentian Mixed  Forest Province | work = Ecological Classification System | publisher =  Minnesota Department of Natural Resources | date= 2007 | url = http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/ecs/212/index.html  | accessdate = 2007-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conifers  include [[pine]]s,  [[spruce]]s,  [[fir]]s, and [[juniper]]s; [[deciduous]] types include [[Populus tremuloides|aspens]], [[oak]]s, [[paper birch]]es, [[Sorbus|mountain ash]] and [[maple]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gibbon |first=Guy E. |last2=Johnson |first2=Craig M. |last3=Hobbes |first3=Elizabeth |chapter=Minnesota's Environment and Native American Culture History |title=A Predictive Model of Precontact Archaeological Site Location for the State of Minnesota |publisher=Minnesota Department of  Transportation |year=2002 |chapter-url=https://www.dot.state.mn.us/mnmodel/P3FinalReport/chapter3.html |accessdate=December 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Heinselman&gt;{{Citation | last =  Heinselman | first = Miron | title = The Boundary Waters Wilderness  ecosystem | place= Minneapolis | publisher =  University of Minnesota Press | year = 1996 | pages = 16–31 | isbn = 0-8166-2804-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It is often said to have a distinct smell, which is attributed partially to the presence of [[Comptonia (plant)|sweet fern]].

The climate for the region roughly corresponds with USDA Plant Hardiness Zones 3a through 4b, although in New England the region extends into zone 5a. The forest region is adapted to the [[Humid continental climate]] with warm, humid summers and cold, snowy winters. The [[Köppen climate classification]] is Dfb.

During the lumbering era, unrestricted logging and the resulting fires destroyed much of the forest.  With the advent of fire suppression and forest management, the resulting second-growth forest differed substantially from the original forest cover.  Conifer tree species became less common in the resulting forest. Early successional tree species such as [[Aspen]] and [[Birch]] became much more prevalent and replaced much of the mixed conifer and deciduous forests that originally existed prior to the logging era.

Major animal species inhabiting the forest include [[White-tailed deer]], [[Moose]], [[Porcupine]], [[Beaver]], the [[American red squirrel]], the [[Eastern gray squirrel]], [[Chipmunk]], [[Opossum]], [[Raccoon]], [[Bobcat]], [[Canada lynx]], [[Fisher (animal)]], [[American marten]], [[Long-tailed weasel]], [[Ruffed grouse]], [[Spruce grouse]], [[Bald eagle]], [[Red-tailed hawk]], [[Osprey]], [[Common loon]], [[Duck]], [[Canada goose]], [[Wild turkey]], [[Sandhill crane]], [[Snowshoe hare]], the [[American black bear]], [[Coyote]], [[Red fox]], and (in the Canadian and upper [[Great Lakes]] states regions) the [[Gray wolf]].  [[Elk]] have been reintroduced in northern [[Wisconsin]], [[Michigan]], and [[Ontario]] after having been extirpated prior to the 20th century by overhunting and habitat loss.  Lone [[Cougar]] have been documented moving through the region, but these appear to consist of solitary young males dispersing from the [[Great plains]], and little evidence of breeding populations is currently known to exist in the region.

The [[Boreal woodland caribou]] used to inhabit the American portions of the region, but with the destruction of the original forest during the late 19th and early 20th centuries and the resulting expansion of the [[White-tailed deer]] population (which carry the deadly [[Parelaphostrongylus tenuis]] brain worm parasite), the species is now confined to [[Canada]].

==History==
[[File:Gfp-wisconsin-governor-thompsons-state-park-left-side-of-wood-lake.jpg|thumb|Woods Lake and background mixed forest in Wisconsin's Governor Thompson State Park.]]
Early French, British, and American trappers exploited the large populations of furbearers in the region, especially the American [[Beaver]].  As a result, populations of these furbearers plummeted, only recovering after the institution of modern game management.

During the 19th century, [[Native Americans in the United States]] were forcibly removed from their lands and/or confined to small reservations after signing treaties with the U.S. government.  As a result of these treaties, most of the land in this region was opened to white settlement.  However, many of the treaties guaranteed off-reservation hunting, fishing, and gathering rights on the ceded lands.  After several court cases during the 20th century in which these rights were upheld, Native Americans continue to exercise their hunting and gathering rights.

The initial economy of the region was heavily dependent on logging.  The logging progressed from east to west across the region during the 19th and early 20th centuries as the supply of virgin timber was exhausted.  The logging provided the lumber necessary to build cities and towns throughout the eastern and central U.S., and communities sprang up around the saw mills that were built to process the lumber. The massive scale of the logging greatly reduced the prevalence of the large Eastern White Pines ([[Pinus strobus]]) and Red Pines ([[Pinus resinosa]]) formerly found throughout the region.

Major wildfires feeding on the [[Slash (logging)]] during the late 19th century resulted from the unrestricted lumbering throughout the region.  The [[Peshtigo Fire]] on October 8, 1871 in northeastern [[Wisconsin]] was the deadliest wildfire in American history, with more than 1,500 deaths resulting from the fire.

After  loggers left in late 19th century, lodges were built as fishing camps and  affluent sportsmen arrived by rail. In the 1920s, roads were built and  automobiles became more affordable. The next four decades were the  golden age of lake resorts of the North Woods. The influx of families  continued towards the north, and the now familiar log-cabin look with  massive beams, fieldstone [[fireplace]],  and boulder foundations became synonymous with the North Woods. In the  late 1940s and 1950s, the expansion continued. However, today, only a  few classic-styled  lodges survive to give a feel of the golden era.

In addition to the many private resorts in the region, many of the cutover forest lands were acquired by state and federal governments for forestry purposes after early attempts at farming the region mostly failed.  The resulting national, state, and county parks and forests throughout the region provide sustainable logging and recreational opportunities.

This is a '''list of the [[Sites of Special Scientific Interest]] (SSSIs) in [[West Yorkshire]]'''. [[English Nature]], the designating body for SSSIs in [[England]], uses the [[Metropolitan and non-metropolitan counties of England|1974–1996 county system]], and the same approach is followed here, rather than, for example, merging all [[Yorkshire]] sites into a single list.

For other counties, see [[List of SSSIs by Area of Search]].

This is not a complete list of all pipeline accidents. '''For natural gas alone''', the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), a United States Department of Transportation agency, has collected data on more than 3,200 accidents deemed serious or significant since 1987.

A "significant incident" results in any of the following consequences:
* fatality or injury requiring in-patient hospitalization
* $50,000 or more in total costs, measured in 1984 dollars
* liquid releases of five or more barrels (42 US gal/barrel)
* releases resulting in an unintentional fire or explosion

PHMSA and the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) post incident data and results of investigations into accidents involving pipelines that carry a variety of products, including natural gas, oil, diesel fuel, gasoline, kerosene, jet fuel, carbon dioxide, and other substances. Occasionally pipelines are repurposed to carry different products.&lt;ref&gt;Data sets of PHMSA Pipeline Safety-Flagged Incidents for 1986-2001, 2002-2009, and 2010-2017 can be downloaded from the tab by that name on the PHMSA's Pipeline Incident Flagged Files page at https://www.phmsa.dot.gov/data-and-statistics/pipeline/pipeline-incident-flagged-files, accessed 2018.01.10. PHMSA Corrective Action Orders are at https://primis.phmsa.dot.gov/comm/reports/enforce/CAO_opid_0.html. PHMSA Pipeline Failure Investigation Reports are at https://www.phmsa.dot.gov/safety-reports/pipeline-failure-investigation-reports. NTSB Pipeline Accident Reports are at https://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/AccidentReports/Pages/pipeline.aspx.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Incidents ==
* On January 25, a TEPPCO 8-inch propane pipeline failed, near [[Davenport, New York]]. The propane ignited, destroying a trailer house, and forcing evacuations. About 5,000 barrels of propane were burned. There were no injuries. The incident resulted from a through-wall failure of the pipe material at a fitting that was attached to the top of the pipe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CPF No.- 1-2004-5002-H |url=http://primis.phmsa.dot.gov/comm/reports/enforce/documents/120045002H/120045002H.pdf |accessdate=27 November 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170206191748/https://primis.phmsa.dot.gov/comm/reports/enforce/documents/120045002H/120045002H.pdf |archivedate=February 6, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CPF No. 1-2010-5008H |url=http://primis.phmsa.dot.gov/comm/reports/enforce/documents/120105008H/120105008H_CAO_09022010_text.pdf |accessdate=27 November 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170208200819/https://primis.phmsa.dot.gov/comm/reports/enforce/documents/120105008H/120105008H_CAO_09022010_text.pdf |archivedate=February 8, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On March 12, a TEPPCO pipeline spilled about 500 barrels of unleaded gasoline spilled into Moro Creek, which flows into the [[Sabine River (Texas–Louisiana)|Sabine River]] near [[Kingsland, Arkansas]]. The cause was corrosion of a 1/2-inch bleeder line, that was part of a 20-inch pipeline block valve used to equalize pressure across the valve.&lt;ref name="www2.epa.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2013-09/documents/teppco-cd.pdf |format=PDF |title=United States v TE Products Pipeline Company |website=Epa.gov |accessdate=January 18, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304095159/http://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2013-09/documents/teppco-cd.pdf |archivedate=March 4, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On April 28, a 14-inch diameter petroleum pipeline of [[Kinder Morgan Energy Partners]] ruptured, and spilled an estimated 103,000 gallons of diesel fuel into marshes, adjacent to [[Suisun Bay]], in Northern California. The line failed from external cossorosion. The company failed to notify California authorities about the spill for 18 hours, a failure for which it was later cited.&lt;ref name="nwf"&gt;{{cite web |title=Fuel Oil Incident List |url=http://www.nwf.org/News-and-Magazines/Media-Center/News-by-Topic/Global-Warming/2010/~/media/PDFs/Global%20Warming/Reports/Full-Oil-Incident-List.ashx |accessdate=October 30, 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100803143750/http://www.nwf.org/News-and-Magazines/Media-Center/News-by-Topic/Global-Warming/2010/~/media/PDFs/Global%20Warming/Reports/Full-Oil-Incident-List.ashx |archivedate=August 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2004/04/30/MNGQ46DALP47.DTL |work=The San Francisco Chronicle |first1=Demian |last1=Bulwa |first2=Kelly |last2=St. John |first3=Peter |last3=Fimrite |title=Pipeline spills {{convert|60,000|USgal|L}} of fuel into Suisun Marsh / Operators noticed the problem on Tuesday but waited to report it |date=June 24, 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090315191702/http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=%2Fc%2Fa%2F2004%2F04%2F30%2FMNGQ46DALP47.DTL |archivedate=March 15, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://projects.propublica.org/pipelines/incidents/271379 |title=April 27, 2004 – ProPublica |publisher= |accessdate=January 15, 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141206063357/http://projects.propublica.org/pipelines/incidents/271379 |archivedate=December 6, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kinder Morgan was fined $5.3 million for the spill, and agreed to enhance spill prevention, response and reporting practices.&lt;ref&gt;Scott Marshall, “Kinder-Morgan to pay $5.3 million for fuel spills,” ''Contra Costa Times'', May 21, 2007, http://www.contracostatimes.com/search/ci_5950251, accessed June 16, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;
* On May 23, a leak in a sampling tube on a pipeline in [[Renton, Washington]] spilled several thousand gallons of gasoline, which ignited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Gordy Holt|author2= Robert Mcclur |url=http://www.seattlepi.com/local/174862_olympic25.html |title=Wear caused gas leak in Olympic pipeline |publisher=Seattlepi.com |date=May 24, 2004 |accessdate=April 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* On August 19, a series of explosions hit an underground natural gas storage cavern in [[Moss Bluff, Texas]], resulting in evacuations for a 3-mile radius. The first blast, about 4&amp;nbsp;a.m., sent flames 150 to 200 feet into the air. The second explosion was seen as far as 20 miles away. Equipment failure was suspected. The cavern had just been expanded using the SMUG (solution mining under gas) process, which permits salt cavern expansion without interrupting gas storage operations. There were no injuries reported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/nation/2004-08-20-gas-explosion_x.htm?csp=36 |work=USA Today |title=Second explosion rocks gas storage facility in Texas |date=August 20, 2004 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130412204116/http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/nation/2004-08-20-gas-explosion_x.htm?csp=36 |archivedate=April 12, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On August 21, 2004, a natural gas explosion destroyed a home in [[DuBois, Pennsylvania]], killing the two residents and doing $800,000 in property damage. After the accident, the National Fuel Gas Distribution Corporation (National Fuel) probed the ground near the residence for gas leaks and found combustible readings in one area adjacent to the house, and in another area directly over the failed pipe on the front lawn. National Fuel began excavating the lawn and uncovered a leaking butt-fusion joint in a 2-inch-diameter plastic gas pipe. NTSB investigators concluded that the probable cause of the leak, explosion, and fire was the fracture of the defective joint.&lt;ref&gt;NTSB Pipeline Accident Brief, https://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/AccidentReports/Reports/PAB0601.pdf, accessed 2018.01.10.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DCA-04-MP-006 |url=http://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/AccidentReports/Reports/PAB0601.pdf |accessdate=27 November 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170201221613/https://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/AccidentReports/Reports/PAB0601.pdf |archivedate=February 1, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On September 26, vandals started up a trackhoe at a construction site in [[New Caney, Texas]], and dug into a propylene pipeline. The escaping propylene ignited, causing nearby residents to evacuate. There were no injuries reported. 2 men were later arrested for this incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/article/Trespassers-blamed-for-pipeline-explosion-1955274.php |title=Trespassers blamed for pipeline explosion – Houston Chronicle |publisher=Chron.com |date=September 27, 2004 |accessdate=April 2, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131028013412/http://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/article/Trespassers-blamed-for-pipeline-explosion-1955274.php |archivedate=October 28, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/article/New-Caney-men-arrested-in-pipeline-explosion-1654167.php|title=New Caney men arrested in pipeline explosion|date=September 29, 2004|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On September 27, 2004, near [[Blair, Nebraska]], an ammonia pipeline failed, releasing 193,213 pounds of ammonia, resulting in the hospitalization of one individual and emergency responders evacuated houses within a one-mile circumference of the break. An estimated 1,000 fish were killed along North Creek and in a golf course pond.&lt;ref name="justice"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2009/August/09-enrd-807.html |title=Pipeline Firms to Pay $3.65 Million to Settle Claims Related to 2004 Ammonia Spills in Nebraska and Kansas – OPA – Department of Justice |publisher= |accessdate=January 15, 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140713040002/http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2009/August/09-enrd-807.html |archivedate=July 13, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On September 28, a pipeline failed in [[Hughes County, Oklahoma]], spilling an estimated {{convert|1500|oilbbl|m3}} of diesel fuel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CPF No. 4-2004-5028H |url=http://primis.phmsa.dot.gov/comm/reports/enforce/documents/420045028H/420045028H_Corrective%20Action%20Order_10012004.pdf |accessdate=27 November 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170211183428/https://primis.phmsa.dot.gov/Comm/Reports/enforce/documents/420045028H/420045028H_Corrective%20Action%20Order_10012004.pdf |archivedate=February 11, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* On October 27, an anhydrous ammonia pipeline ruptured near [[Kingman, Kansas]], and released approximately {{convert|4858|oilbbl|m3}} of anhydrous ammonia. Nobody was killed or injured due to the release. The anhydrous ammonia leak killed more than 20,000 fish along a 12.5-mile section of [[Smoots Creek]], including some from threatened species. The pipeline had previous damage to it. The pipeline controller had misinterpreted the leak as other problems with the system operation, causing the leak to go on longer. As a result of this, and another ammonia pipeline leak the month before, the pipeline owner and its two operating companies were later fined $3.65&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name="justice"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ens-newswire.com/ens/aug2009/2009-08-14-093.asp |title=Ammonia Spills in Nebraska, Kansas Cost Pipeline Firms $3.65M |publisher=ENS-Newswire.com |date= |accessdate=April 2, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131028103937/http://www.ens-newswire.com/ens/aug2009/2009-08-14-093.asp |archivedate=October 28, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On November 1, construction crew ruptured a high-pressure gas line in [[Little Rock, Arkansas]], near one of the state's busiest intersections Monday, triggering a fire that melted traffic lights overhead. No one was injured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.firehouse.com/news/news/gas-line-explodes-west-little-rock-arkansas |title=Gas Line Explodes In West Little Rock, Arkansas |publisher=Firehouse |date=November 1, 2004 |accessdate=April 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On November 8, a NGL pipeline failed in a housing division in [[Ivel, Kentucky]]. The vapor cloud from the leak ignited, seriously burning a Kentucky State Trooper evacuating those living in the area. Eight others were injured and five houses were destroyed. The pipeline, only {{convert|65|mi|km}} long, had 11 previous corrosion failures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CPF No. 2-2004-5017H |url=http://primis.phmsa.dot.gov/comm/reports/enforce/documents/220045017H/CPF2_2004_5017H_CAO.pdf |accessdate=27 November 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170208110720/https://primis.phmsa.dot.gov/comm/reports/enforce/documents/220045017H/CPF2_2004_5017H_CAO.pdf |archivedate=February 8, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=266&amp;dat=20041111&amp;id=ONkrAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=GQUGAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1534,3752372|title=Kentucky New Era – Google News Archive Search|publisher=|accessdate=January 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Installed in the 1950s, the ruptured 4-inch steel transmission line belonged to Kentucky-West Virginia Gas Co., a division of Equitable Gas in Pittsburgh, but was operated by Colorado-based Mark West Hydrocarbon.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Alford, "Gas Explosion Destroys Kentucky Subdivision," November 9, 2004, http://www.firehouse.com/news/10508161/gas-explosion-destroys-kentucky-subdivision.&lt;/ref&gt; Investigators found external corrosion and a small hole in the pipeline.&lt;ref&gt;Greg Griffin, "Natural-gas explosion creates legal firestorm," ''Denver Post'', November 25, 2005 | UPDATED: May 8, 2016, https://www.denverpost.com/2005/11/25/natural-gas-explosion-creates-legal-firestorm/, accessed 2018.01.10.&lt;/ref&gt;
* On November 9, in [[Walnut Creek, California]], a petroleum pipeline carrying gasoline to [[San Jose, California]], owned and operated by [[Kinder Morgan Energy Partners]] (KMEP) was struck by a backhoe used by Mountain Cascade, Inc., a contractor operating in the construction of a water pipeline for the East Bay Municipal Utility District (EBMUD). A large gasoline spill was subsequently ignited, resulting in an explosive fireball that incinerated five workers, severely injuring four others. A Kinder Morgan worker had misread an as-built map, and had incorrectly marked the pipeline's route before the accident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://osfm.fire.ca.gov/pipeline/pdf/WCFinalReport/KMWCInvRep.pdf |title=Pipeline System |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=April 2, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130406122502/http://osfm.fire.ca.gov/pipeline/pdf/WCFinalReport/KMWCInvRep.pdf |archivedate=April 6, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; CalOSHA (California Occupational Safety and Health Administration) cited Kinder Morgan for failure to accurately mark or map the pipeline location.&lt;ref&gt;Officials Dole Out Fines In Fatal Pipeline Explosion, May 5, 2005, http://www.ktvu.com/news/news/officials-dole-out-fines-in-fatal-pipeline-explosi/nKYpc/, accessed June 18, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, the California Fire Marshal fined Kinder Morgan $500,000 for its role in this “completely preventable” disaster.&lt;ref&gt;Cal/OSHA Issues Multi-Employer Citation, http://www.dir.ca.gov/dirnews/2005/ir2005-20.html; California Fir Investigation Report, http://osfm.fire.ca.gov/pipeline/pdf/WCFinalReport/PenaltyLetter.pdf; “Kinder Morgan reaches safety deal,” April 10, 2006, http://www.marketwatch.com/story/kinder-morgan-energy-us-reach-safety-deal.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, Kinder Morgan was convicted on six felony charges related to the Walnut Creek explosion and was fined $15 million.&lt;ref&gt;Henry K.

== Incidents ==

This is not a complete list of all pipeline accidents. '''For natural gas alone''', the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), a United States Department of Transportation agency, has collected data on more than 3,200 accidents deemed serious or significant since 1987.

A "significant incident" results in any of the following consequences:
* fatality or injury requiring in-patient hospitalization
* $50,000 or more in total costs, measured in 1984 dollars
* liquid releases of five or more barrels (42 US gal/barrel)
* releases resulting in an unintentional fire or explosion

PHMSA and the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) post incident data and results of investigations into accidents involving pipelines that carry a variety of products, including natural gas, oil, diesel fuel, gasoline, kerosene, jet fuel, carbon dioxide, and other substances. Occasionally pipelines are repurposed to carry different products.&lt;ref&gt;Data sets of PHMSA Pipeline Safety-Flagged Incidents for 1986-2001, 2002-2009, and 2010-2017 can be downloaded from the tab by that name on the PHMSA's Pipeline Incident Flagged Files page at https://www.phmsa.dot.gov/data-and-statistics/pipeline/pipeline-incident-flagged-files, accessed 2018.01.10. PHMSA Corrective Action Orders are at https://primis.phmsa.dot.gov/comm/reports/enforce/CAO_opid_0.html. PHMSA Pipeline Failure Investigation Reports are at https://www.phmsa.dot.gov/safety-reports/pipeline-failure-investigation-reports. NTSB Pipeline Accident Reports are at https://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/AccidentReports/Pages/pipeline.aspx.&lt;/ref&gt;

* On January 1, an [[Enbridge]] pipeline that runs from [[Superior, Wisconsin]] to near [[Whitewater, Wisconsin]] failed, resulting in a spill of 1,500 barrels of crude oil onto farmland and into a drainage ditch. Incomplete fusion of a longitudinal weld at the pipe maker that failed as pressure cycle was established as the cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Content |first=Thomas |url=http://www.jsonline.com/business/29254864.html |title=Milwaukee Journal Sentinel: "Oil group cleans spill in Clark County" |publisher=Jsonline.com |date=January 4, 2007 |accessdate=April 2, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130520082146/http://www.jsonline.com/business/29254864.html |archivedate=May 20, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="phmsa.dot.gov"&gt;{{cite web|title=CPF No. 3-2012-5017H |url=http://www.phmsa.dot.gov/staticfiles/PHMSA/DownloadableFiles/Files/Pipeline/Corrective_Action_Order_073012.pdf |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130222200918/http://www.phmsa.dot.gov/staticfiles/PHMSA/DownloadableFiles/Files/Pipeline/Corrective_Action_Order_073012.pdf |archivedate=February 22, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* On February 17, in a rural area of [[Harris County, Texas]], a [[Tennessee Gas Pipeline]] transmission pipeline was damaged, and later exploded and burned. Grass fires spread across a three-square mile rural area.&lt;ref name="YouTube"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiWC5FMjHv8 |title=Pipeline Fire |website=[[YouTube]] |accessdate=January 15, 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140705194810/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiWC5FMjHv8 |archivedate=July 5, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 31-inch natural gas pipeline leaked after a bulldozer hit it.

* On April 27, a 22-inch gas transmission pipeline failed near [[Pawnee, Illinois]]. The failure ejected a 109 inch long section of pipe, and, releasing 38&amp;nbsp;mmcf of natural gas that ignited. The rupture and resulting fire required the evacuation of a residence and the death of farm animals. The failure was due to external corrosion.&lt;ref name="dot3"&gt;{{cite web|title=CPF No. 3-2014-10088 |url=http://primis.phmsa.dot.gov/comm/reports/enforce/documents/320141008S/320141008S_Notice%20of%20Proposed%20Safety%20Order_12242014.pdf |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150115105300/http://primis.phmsa.dot.gov/comm/reports/enforce/documents/320141008S/320141008S_Notice%20of%20Proposed%20Safety%20Order_12242014.pdf |archivedate=January 15, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On May 4, a backhoe helping to lay a gas pipeline hit another gas pipeline in [[Weatherford, Texas]]. The gas ignited, sending flames hundreds of feet into the air. Vehicles, equipment, and power lines in the area were destroyed, but there were no injuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2457&amp;dat=20070313&amp;id=PME8AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=JC4MAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1435,3195635|title=Bangor Daily News – Google News Archive Search|publisher=|accessdate=January 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On May 16, about {{convert|63,000|USgal|L}} of gasoline spilled into an old stripping pit that covers a three-acre area in [[Coal Township, Pennsylvania]]. The Kerris and Helfrick company owns the property where the gas leak occurred, and the excavator, was working for the company when he accidentally ruptured the Sunoco Logistics 14-inch petroleum pipeline. The gasoline was mostly absorbed into areas of soil, fill and coal strippings at the site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Leak in Jackson Township, Tioga County in the NCRO weekly report |url=http://dothemountain.wordpress.com/2009/10/16/spill-in-jackson-township-tioga-county-in-the-ncro-weekly-report/ |website=How Should We Do the Mountain? |accessdate=27 November 2016 |date=16 October 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161019064755/https://dothemountain.wordpress.com/2009/10/16/spill-in-jackson-township-tioga-county-in-the-ncro-weekly-report/ |archivedate=October 19, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Several residents made U.S. Rep. Christopher P. Carney aware of complaints about gasoline odors in residential basements. "Moreover, many residents are legitimately concerned about groundwater contamination as well as a host of future problems associated with the spill", Carney wrote to Department of Environmental Protection Secretary Kathleen McGinty.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} The pipeline was installed in 1964 by the Atlantic Richfield Co.(ARCO) and purchased in 1990 by Sunoco. On September 29, the PADEP Environmental Cleanup program finalized a consent order and agreement with Mallard Contracting, which included a $45,000 civil penalty covering both DEP's response costs and a fine for violations of the Pa. Solid Waste Management Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsitem.com/news/small-gas-leak-on-little-mountain-posed-no-danger-1.1604903 |title=Small gas leak on Little Mountain posed no danger |publisher= |accessdate=January 15, 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141020064607/http://newsitem.com/news/small-gas-leak-on-little-mountain-posed-no-danger-1.1604903 |archivedate=October 20, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In August, a gas compressor turbine caught fire inside BP's Gathering Center 1 in [[Alaska]], after an oil hose ruptured and spewed flammable liquid across the motor. A mechanic on patrol in the facility — seeing smoke — fled the room as the turbine burst into flames. Automatic fire and gas alarms were never triggered. A subsequent investigation by Alaska state authorities found that a ruptured hydraulic oil hose was Jerry-rigged in a position that chaffed against the turbine's hot engine. The investigation also found that the facility's fire and gas detectors were not powered on at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.alaskadispatch.com/article/bp-alaska-facilities-still-risk?page=0,1 |title=BP Alaska facilities still at risk |publisher=Alaska Dispatch |date=November 7, 2010 |accessdate=April 2, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131028011305/http://www.alaskadispatch.com/article/bp-alaska-facilities-still-risk?page=0%2C1 |archivedate=October 28, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On October 8, a gas pipeline at a gas storage facility in [[Salem, Michigan]] ruptured and caught fire. Siding was melted on nearby houses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wzzm13.com/news/article/82016/14/Investigation-begins-into-what-caused-natural-gas-explosion|archive-url=https://archive.is/20131218230754/http://www.wzzm13.com/news/article/82016/14/Investigation-begins-into-what-caused-natural-gas-explosion|dead-url=yes|archive-date=December 18, 2013|title=Investigation begins into what caused natural gas explosion|work=wzzm13.com|accessdate=January 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On October 18, an ethylene pipeline explosion early, was heard for miles around [[Port Arthur, Texas]], waking residents. The following fire spread to a nearby butadiene pipeline, causing it to rupture and burn. Later, over 300 residents sued the pipeline's owners for health issues claimed to be caused from the chemicals released by the accident. External corrosion of the ethylene pipeline caused the first pipeline failure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=84c_1192763205 |title=Dow Chemical Ethylene Pipe Explodes in Port Arthur, Texas |publisher=LiveLeak.com |date= |accessdate=April 2, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130426074056/http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=84c_1192763205 |archivedate=April 26, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ryan Myers |url=http://www.beaumontenterprise.com/news/article/Pipeline-explosion-spurs-lawsuit-770820.php |title=Pipeline explosion spurs lawsuit |publisher=Beaumont Enterprise |date=October 2, 2008 |accessdate=April 2, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131027214641/http://www.beaumontenterprise.com/news/article/Pipeline-explosion-spurs-lawsuit-770820.php |archivedate=October 27, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On November 1, a 12-inch propane pipeline exploded, killing two people, and injuring five others, near [[Carmichael, Mississippi|Carmichael]] in the southeast portion of [[Clarke County, Mississippi]]. The NTSB determined the probable cause was an LF-[[Electric resistance welding|ERW]] seam failure. During hydrostatic testing of the pipeline after repair, another LF-ERW seam failed nearby. Inadequate education of residents near the pipeline about the existence of this pipeline, and how to respond to a pipeline accident, were also cited as a factors in the deaths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/AccidentReports/Pages/PAR0901.aspx |title=Pipeline Accident Report PAR-09-01 |work=ntsb.gov |accessdate=January 18, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150922142551/http://ntsb.gov/investigations/AccidentReports/Pages/PAR0901.aspx |archivedate=September 22, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On November 12, three teenaged boys drilled into an ammonia pipeline, in [[Tampa Bay, Florida]], causing a major ammonia leak. They later claimed they did it due to stories of money being hidden inside that pipeline. The leak took two days to be capped. One of the teens had serious chemical burns from the ammonia. Residents within a half miles from the leak were evacuated. PHMSA later noted the pipeline company failed to adequately plan for emergencies with the local Fire Agency, as required by CFR 195.402(c)(12).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CPF No. 2-2008-6002 |url=http://primis.phmsa.dot.gov/comm/reports/enforce/documents/220086002/220086002_FinalOrder_04262010.pdf |accessdate=27 November 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170211114341/https://primis.phmsa.dot.gov/comm/reports/enforce/documents/220086002/220086002_FinalOrder_04262010.pdf |archivedate=February 11, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On November 13, [[Enbridge]] discovered a leak on their 34-inch Line 3, at Mile Post 912, near [[Clearbrook, Minnesota]]. Later, the pipeline exploded during repairs, on November 27, causing the deaths of two employees. DOT officials said that two Enbridge workers died in a crude oil explosion as they worked to make repairs on the former Lakehead system pipeline. Enbridge was cited for failing to safely and adequately perform maintenance and repair activities, clear the designated work area from possible sources of ignition, and hire properly trained and qualified workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chron.com/business/article/Enbridge-fined-in-fatal-Minnesota-accident-1705992.php |title=Enbridge fined in fatal Minnesota accident – Houston Chronicle |publisher=Chron.com |date=August 18, 2010 |accessdate=April 2, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131028012942/http://www.chron.com/business/article/Enbridge-fined-in-fatal-Minnesota-accident-1705992.php |archivedate=October 28, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Griese |first=Noel |url=http://energypipelinenews.blogspot.com/2009/05/enbridge-will-appeal-24-million-fine.html |title=Energy Pipeline News: Enbridge will appeal $2.4 million fine levied for fatal Minnesota accident |publisher=Energypipelinenews.blogspot.com |date=May 8, 2009 |accessdate=April 2, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131107012920/http://energypipelinenews.blogspot.com/2009/05/enbridge-will-appeal-24-million-fine.html |archivedate=November 7, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exceptionally long sentences in print==

One of the longest sentences in literature is contained in [[William Faulkner]]'s ''[[Absalom, Absalom!]]'' (1936). The sentence is composed of 1,288 words (In the 1951 Random House version).&lt;ref name=rebecca/&gt;

Another sentence that is often claimed to be the longest sentence ever written is Molly Bloom's soliloquy in the [[James Joyce]] novel ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'' (1922),  which contains a sentence of 3,687 words.&lt;ref name=rebecca/&gt; However, this sentence is simply many sentences without punctuation.

[[Jonathan Coe]]'s ''[[The Rotters' Club (novel)|The Rotters' Club]]'' appears to hold the record at 13,955 words.&lt;ref name=rebecca&gt;{{cite web |last=Jones |first=Rebecca |date=3 October 2014 |title=Longest Sentence |work=Today |publisher=BBC |accessdate=12 February 2015 |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/today/reports/archive/arts/sentence.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was inspired by [[Bohumil Hrabal]]'s ''[[Dancing Lessons for the Advanced in Age]]'': a [[Czech language]] novel written in one long sentence.

{{see also|Energy modeling#MARKAL/TIMES}}

'''MARKAL''' is a numerical model used to carry out economic analysis of different energy related systems at the country level to represent its evolution over a period of usually of 40–50 years. The word MARKAL was generated by concatenating two words (MARKet and ALlocation).  Various parameters such as energy costs, plant costs, plant performances, building performance and so on, can be input and the [[software]] will choose an optimal technology mix to meet that demand at minimum cost.  It is available from the [[International Energy Agency]].&lt;ref name="markal"&gt;

'''Marselisborg Forests''' ({{lang-da|Marselisborgskovene}}), or simply Marselisborg Forest, is a {{convert|1300|ha|acre}} forest to the south of [[Aarhus]] City in the [[Denmark|Kingdom of Denmark]]. Many present day sources now includes the forest of Fløjstrup, as part of the Marselisborg Forests, upping the total area with another {{convert|200|ha|acre}}. Marselisborg Forests runs along the coastline of the [[Aarhus Bay]] in a hilly terrain with steep slopes and deep gullies, especially at the shoreline. There are many traces of prehistoric activities here and the landscape have been covered by woodlands for thousands of years.

== History ==
Marselisborg Forests is comprised by a collection of small patches of [[woodland]], that have been allowed to merge into a single entity, mainly after 1820. The woodland patches originally belonged to the [[feudal barony|barony]] of [[Gabriel Marselis|Marselis]], residing at the now gone Marselisborg (meaning "Marselis-castle"), where [[Marselisborg Gymnasium]] is located today. Before 1820, there was an extensive [[forestry]] in the woods, so most of the trees are no more than 200 years old. Aarhus Municipality took ownership of the land and forests in 1896, when they acquired the Marselis [[estate (land)|estate]].

=== Cultural importance ===
[[File:Århus - set fra Moesgaard skov.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Aarhus seen from Moesgård. Painting from the 1800s by Peter Holm.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Holm was a painter and organist at the [[Church of Our Lady (Aarhus)|Church of Our Lady]] in Aarhus&lt;/ref&gt; ]]
Marselisborg Forests have a long cultural history as a recreational area for Aarhus and its citizens and today it is among the most frequented forests in Denmark. The forests are used heavily&lt;ref&gt;In a 2007 survey 21% of the questioned citizens said, that they used Marselisborg Forests more than once a month.

The forestry business is rather limited today. Marselisborg Forests are home to several important facilities for the citizens of the Aarhus area, such as:

In the old days the Varna stream was called [http://aarhuswiki.dk/wiki/Skamb%C3%A6kken Skambækken] - Aarhus Wiki&lt;/ref&gt; Initially a [[powder mill]] and with a history as a guesthouse and restaurant, tracing back to the 1700s.

The many sources to the cultural history and recreational use of the Marselisborg Forests through the ages, suggests that the forests were used even more extensively in previous times, than today. In the early 1900s, it even housed a [[zoo]], and two [[steamboat]]s regularly transported citizens from the Aarhus harbour to various spots, just for recreational purposes. Many of the historic documents of the booming restaurants and scenes, reports dramatic drops in turnovers, when [[television]] was introduced in the 1950-60's.

As one of the more popular and noteworthy happenings of our time, the northern parts of Marselisborg Forests housed a [[Sculpture by the Sea]] event once every second year in June from 2009 to 2015. The tradition was initiated by [[Mary, Crown Princess of Denmark|crown princess Mary]] and [[Frederik, Crown Prince of Denmark|crown prince Frederik of Denmark]], inspired by Australia; Mary's country of birth. The event called 'Sculpture by the Sea, Aarhus - Denmark' was financially and legally independent of 'Sculpture by the Sea Incorporated' and it was produced by the [[Aarhus Municipality|city of Aarhus]] in collaboration with [[ARoS Aarhus Kunstmuseum|ARoS Aarhus Artmuseum]] under the [[patronage]] of the crown prince couple. The exhibitions attracted an estimated half a million visitors each.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sculpturebythesea.com/exhibitions/aarhus.aspx 3rd Biennial Aarhus Exhibition] Sculpture by the Sea (2013)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://kunsten.nu/journal/aros-praesenterer-afloeseren-for-sculpture-by-the-sea/|title=Aros præsenterer afløseren for Sculpture by the Sea [Aros presents the successor of Sculpture by the Sea]|language=Danish|website=kunsten.nu|date=15 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Flora and fauna ==
[[File:Sti i Marselisborgskovene.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Beech (''[[Fagus sylvatica]]'') is prevalent]]
In spite of the high level of human activity, Marselisborg Forests does have an interesting flora and fauna and it is not impossible to find the peace and tranquillity, that one normally associates with wild nature. It is one of the few big forests in Denmark, that can present larger connected areas of [[natural beech wood]]. Most of the forest is a mixed [[Temperate deciduous forest|deciduous forest]], with species like [[beech]], [[Fraxinus|ash]] and [[maple]] as the most common. There are other areas dominated by [[conifer]], and [[oak]] trees are mixed in throughout the forest.

At Moesgård Museum, sections of the forest have been raised in the 1970s, to recreate various forest-types associated with different epochs since the [[last glacial period|last ice age]]. These sections includes  [[Fraxinus excelsior|ash]], [[birch]] and [[Alnus glutinosa|alder]] [[carr (landform)|swamps]], [[Tilia cordata|linden]], [[elm]] and [[oak]] woods. Mixed in is also the versatile [[hazel]] and [[Malus sylvestris|forest apple]].

Marselisborg Forests is home to very rich and varied [[fungi]] colonies, with several rare or threatened species. The forests is known for its [[Mycorrhiza]], but also the rare and poisonous [[Satan's mushroom]]s, [[Amanita strobiliformis|Warted Amanita]],&lt;ref&gt;''Amanita strobiliformis'' is called 'Flosset Fluesvamp' in Danish, meaning ''lit.'': frayed fly-mushroom&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ramaria sanguinea|bleeding coral]]s are to be found here. In some years, larger quantities of the edible [[Boletus edulis|porcino]], [[Craterellus cornucopioides|trumpet of the dead]] and [[Russula cyanoxantha|charcoal burner]] can be found, to mention a few examples.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.in2.dk/svampe/lokal.html Mushrooms in Eastern Jutland] private homepage (Flemming V. Larsen) {{da icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The forests supports a population of [[northern crested newt]]s. They are common in Denmark, preferring the south-eastern parts of the country, and is thus not a [[Red List]] species, but their [[habitats]] are threatened on an international scale. Based partly on these facts, a larger part of Marselisborg Forests is to be protected under the EU [[Habitats Directive]] and have been designated as area H234.

'''Mid-Atlantic Soft Matter Workshop''' or '''MASM''' is an interdisciplinary meeting on [[soft matter]] routinely hosted and participated in by research and educational organizations in the [[Mid-Atlantic states|mid-Atlantic region]] of the [[United States]].

The workshop consists of several talks relating to the field of soft matter given by invited lecturers, and these talks are interspersed with sessions of short, three-minute "sound-bite" talks that can be delivered by any participant.

==History==
MASM was started at Georgetown University and organized by Daniel Blair and Jeffrey Urbach of [[Georgetown University]].

There have been 16 MASM meetings.  The 16th MASM meeting was hosted at [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH) on July 29, 2015.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5995">'''Mobile metering''' (recording of data using a mobile meter) is a technology which enables mobile recording of metering data. While railway companies such as the German Deutsche Bahn have been using this technology for years in their trains, it is now also being used for recording the charging transactions of electric vehicles (EVs).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Weil/Neumann|first=|date=January 2017|title=Vergleichende Betrachtung der Sicherheitskonzepte von Mobile Metering und Smart Meter Gateways|url=|journal=PTB-Mitteilungen|volume=125|pages=53–58|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{Cite journal|last=Weil/Neumann|first=|date=January 2016|title=Vergleichende Betrachtung der Sicherheitskonzepte von Mobile Metering und Smart Meter Gateways|url=|journal=Physikalisch-technische Bundesanstalt (National Metrology Institute of Germany)|volume=125|pages=53–58|via=}}

In the latter case, a mobile electricity meter is integrated either into the vehicle itself or into the respective charging cable. This, together with the necessary communication technology (SIM card), makes it possible to transmit charging data (down to the kWh) to a matching backend. Lean, switchable system sockets suffice for charging – they serve as outlets for the power grid. These system sockets can be reduced to a technical minimum, as the vehicle or the cable, respectively, already carry the necessary billing and communication technology. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=PTB-Anforderungen 50.7 (PTB-A 50.7) Elektronische und softwaregesteuerte Messgeräte und Zusatzeinrichtungen für Elektrizität, Gas, Wasser und Wärme|last=|first=|publisher=Physikalisch-technische Bundesanstalt (National Metrogoly Institute of Germany)|year=2002|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{Cite book|title=PTB-Anforderungen 50.7 (PTB-A 50.7) Elektronische und softwaregesteuerte Messgeräte und Zusatzeinrichtungen für Elektrizität, Gas, Wasser und Wärme.|last=|first=|publisher=PTB (National Metrology Institute of Germany)|year=2002|isbn=|location=|pages=}} This makes these sockets especially affordable and avoids running costs compared to conventional charging infrastructure, such as costs for maintenance or meter point operation. 

As a result, precise metering, secure data transmission and efficient billing fulfill all preconditions for a comprehensive and future-proof charging and billing solution for electric mobility. 

== Development ==

The mobile meter was developed in the projects „On Board Metering I &amp; II“, that kicked off in March 2003, sponsored by the German ministry for economic affairs and technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Baustein für die Energiewende: 7 Eckpunkte für das „Verordnungspaket Intelligente Netze“|last=|first=|publisher=German Federal Ministry for Economy and Energy|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Participants of the project were:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.all-electronics.de/das-auto-lernt-zaehlen-mobile-metering/#|title=Das Auto lernt zählen: Mobile Metering|last=|first=|work=all-electronics.de|date=May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*ubitricity Gesellschaft für verteilte Energiesysteme mbH (Mobile electricity provider / project leader) 

== Aims of the project ==

The project’s approach to electric mobility was not tackling it as a singular challenge. The aim was rather to make a significant contribution to the energy transition by taking electric mobility one step further.

For this to happen, the EV was to become a system-relevant factor as an energy storage device. The goal was to create as much power grid connection points as possible while at the same time safeguarding exact metering and billing of electricity. This way, the vehicle could gain access to the grid anytime it is parked (ratio of EVs to grid connection points greater than 1). Up to that date, charging infrastructure for electric cars was thought of as stationary, similar to conventional gas stations for combustion cars. 

For this, a shift of technology from the infrastructure to the vehicle side (or the cable, respectively) was needed. Such a network of ubiquitous charging spots was only to be realized with charging infrastructure that would cause comparably low costs over longer periods of time. 

== Potentials of the model ==

The disruptive approach of mobile metering has by now opened up new possibilities and business models for electric mobility. 

*Contribution to grid stability. Electric cars can be integrated into the grid as intelligent storage devices. This makes it easier to incorporate the fluctuating electricity production from renewable resources into the overall grid architecture.
*The technology shift from the infrastructure to the vehicle/cable reduces the cost of charging spots. A ubiquitous roll-out of charging infrastructure can be executed with much lower capital investments.
*Free choice of electricity provider and exact billing. The electricity contract can be closed for the vehicle or cable thanks to the mobile meter, while the choice of the respective provider is free.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=On-Board Metering: Mobiles Messen von Tankstrom in Elektrofahrzeugen – sicher, eichgültig und abrechnungsrelevant.|last=Berg/Zisky|first=|publisher=Kahmann/Zayer|year=2012|isbn=978-3-8022-1058-7|location=Frankfurt am Main|pages=283–300}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''NOAAS ''Okeanos Explorer'' (R 337)''' is a converted [[United States Navy]] ship (formerly {{ship|USNS|Capable|T-AGOS-16}}), now an exploratory vessel for the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA), officially launched in 2010.&lt;ref name="mercurynews"/&gt;  Starting in 2010, NOAA entered into a five-year partnership with the [[San Francisco]] [[Exploratorium]]. The focus is on gathering scientific information about oceans for the public as well as for scientific uses. As much as 95% of the ocean remains unexplored, NOAA officials said.&lt;ref name="cnet"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The ship is named after [[Okeanos]], the Ancient Greek god of the sea, from which also comes the word "[[ocean]]".

==Description==
The {{convert|224|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} converted vessel is covered with cameras capable of high definition images, and sophisticated devices such as 3-D sonar mapping systems. It looks like an average ship, except for a {{convert|12|ft|m|adj=mid|-wide}} white ball, its satellite dome,  mounted high above its bridge.&lt;ref name="cnet"/&gt; The ''Okeanos Explorer'' is the only NOAA ship to have a dedicated [[Remotely operated underwater vehicle|ROV]]. Although ROVs have been used on other NOAA ships, they are typically removed at the end of a cruise. Having a permanent ROV makes it easier to deploy at any time throughout the field season. On the ''Okeanos Explorer'', there is an integrated control room for operating the multibeam, ROV and telepresence communication equipment. Having the screens and computers permanently wired to the ship makes it more efficient to sustain long-term exploration in remote areas of the world.

===INDEX 2010 Exploration (Indonesia) ===
[[Image:Euryalid on octocoral.jpg|thumb|An [[Euryalida|euryalid]] brittlestar observed in 2010 in Indonesia.]]
From June to August 2010, an international team led by scientists from the United States and Indonesia collaborated to explore the depths of Indonesian waters. The expedition, Indonesia-USA Deep-Sea Exploration of the Sangihe Talaud Region (INDEX 2010), featured a number of firsts including: the maiden voyage of the ''Okeanos Explorer''; the first joint Indonesia-USA ocean exploration expedition; and the first joint international mission with two ships sending live video to scientists in Exploration Command Centers ashore.

===Galápagos Rift Expedition 2011===
[[Image:Expl6380 (9737323118).jpg|thumb|An abyssal stingray (''[[Bathyraja abyssicola]]'') observed off Galapagos in 2011.]]
From June to July 2011, a team of scientists and technicians both at-sea and on shore conducted exploratory investigations on the diversity and distribution of deep-sea habitats and marine life in the vicinity of the Galápagos Islands. The 50-day expedition is divided into two ‘legs’ and includes work in Ecuador, Costa Rica, and international waters.
Mapping and water column information collected during Leg I identified a number of exciting targets to explore with the Institute for Exploration’s Little Hercules ROV during Leg II. Between July 11 and July 28, the ship explored seamounts, the oldest known vent fields, off-axis sulfide mounds, deep fracture zones, and newly discovered vents.
The expedition also marks the debut of a new camera sled and lighting platform named Seirios. When deployed from the ship with the Little Hercules, provided scientists and the audiences onshore with the very first video footage from a number of deepwater areas around the Galápagos.

===Mid-Cayman Rise Expedition 2011===
In August 2011, NOAA Ship Okeanos Explorer embarked on an expedition to the deepest part of the Caribbean Sea, where a team of international scientists both at-sea and on shore will conduct interdisciplinary investigations of the Mid-Cayman Rise – an ultra-slow spreading center where two plates gradually move apart and upwelling magma creates new crust and the adjacent Cayman Trough.  Our exploration will focus on the oceanic core complexes that appear to dominate construction of the rift valley walls along much of the Mid-Cayman Rise, and the inner wall of the Cayman Trough fracture zone immediately to the north – investigating the geology, marine life, and hydrothermal systems that these areas might host. 
Over the course of 10 days, the ship mapped the rift valley walls of the Mid-Cayman Rise and northern wall of the Cayman Trough Fracture zone using the ship’s deep-water multibeam sonar; explored the water column for hydrothermal activity using a CTD rosette, in situ sensors, and shipboard dissolved methane analysis; and conducted detailed seafloor investigations the ship’s ROV. During the expedition, live video of ongoing operations were to be streamed to shore where a team of scientists from the U.S. and U.K. joined the expedition remotely through the use of telepresence technology.

===Veatch Canyon Shakedown Cruise 2012===
"EX1201" was the first expedition of the 2012 field season for NOAA Ship Okeanos Explorer. The primary objective of this shakedown cruise was to operationally test the vessel, its systems, and all mission equipment. A secondary objective of the expedition was to use the ship’s technologically advanced multibeam sonar to map three Northeast and Mid-Atlantic canyon areas in support of the benthic habitat identification and management efforts of NOAA's Northeast Fisheries Science Center (NEFSC).After departing its homeport of Davisville, Rhode Island, on February 14, Okeanos Explorer proceeded offshore to Veatch Canyon where a sonar patch test was conducted to ensure the proper calibration of the vessel’s multibeam echosounder. As part of successful patch test operations, approximately 280 square kilometers of Veatch Canyon were bathymetrically mapped, including the majority of the first priority area identified by NEFSC.  Later in the cruise, focused survey operations conducted at Block, Ryan, and McMaster Canyons mapped approximately 900 square kilometers of seafloor, including 65 percent of the second NEFSC priority area.Focused mapping operations at Hendrickson, Toms, and Berkeley Canyons covered approximately 1,400 square kilometers of seafloor. Finally, focused mapping operations at Hendrickson, Toms, and Berkeley Canyons covered approximately 1400 square kilometers of seafloor, including 85 percent of the third NEFSC priority area.While transiting along the continental shelf break between focused mapping areas, multibeam, single beam, and sub-bottom sonar data was collected, adding to the seafloor mapping coverage established on Okeanos Explorer cruise EX1106. In addition to successful shakedown testing and mapping operations, EX1201 also yielded a number of positive educational outcomes. During the cruise, two graduate interns were trained in seafloor mapping operations as part of the Okeanos Explorer internship program. Additionally, approximately 50 high school students, educators, and local media toured the vessel and learned about its mission at the conclusion of the expedition, in Charleston, South Carolina.

===Gulf of Mexico 2012 Expedition===
[[Image:Harriotta raleighana. Golfo de México 2012.jpg|thumb|A [[Chimaeriformes|chimaera]] (''[[Harriotta raleighana]]'') observed in the Gulf of Mexico in 2012.]]
From March to April 2012, a team of scientists and technicians both at-sea and on shore will conducted exploratory investigations on the diversity and distribution of deep-sea habitats and marine life in the northern Gulf of Mexico. The 56-day expedition was divided into three 'legs.' Through discussions and information stemming from the May 2011 Atlantic Basin Workshop, Fall 2011 Gulf of Mexico mapping expedition, and Leg I of the 2012 Gulf of Mexico expedition, NOAA and the broader science community identified a number of exciting targets to explore during Legs II and III. We explored cold seeps, deep coral communities, undersea canyons, and shipwrecks.The expedition also marked the return of the Institute for Exploration’s Little Hercules remotely operated vehicle (ROV) and NOAA's Seirios camera sled and lighting platform to the NOAA Ship Okeanos Explorer. When these systems were deployed from the ship, we were able to provide scientists and the audiences onshore with real-time video footage from deepwater areas in important, yet largely unknown, U.S. waters.

===Northeast U.S. Canyons Expedition 2013===
[[Image:Expl9674 (14482341086).jpg|thumb|A ''[[Bathysaurus]]'' observed off USA east coast in 2013.]]
From July to August 2013, a team of scientists and technicians both at-sea and on shore will conduct exploratory investigations on the diversity and distribution of deep-sea habitats and marine life along the Northeast U.S. Canyons and at Mytilus Seamount, located within the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone. The 36-day expedition is composed of two cruise ‘legs.’The exploration area for this community-driven expedition was identified based on the discussions and information stemming from the May 2011 Atlantic Basin Workshop and priority area input received from other NOAA programs and the management community. Using this input, and data acquired during previous Atlantic Canyon Undersea Mapping Expeditions (ACUMEN Project), NOAA and the broader science community have identified a number of exciting targets to explore during the two cruise legs, commencing the next steps in systematic exploration. In the coming weeks, we expect to explore cold seeps, deep coral communities, undersea canyons, landslide features, and a seamount.The expedition also marks the first time NOAA’s new 6,000 meter remotely operated vehicle (ROV), Deep Discoverer and the Seirios camera sled and lighting platform will be used to in a full telepresence-enabled ocean exploration with NOAA Ship Okeanos Explorer. When these systems are deployed from the ship, we will be able to provide scientists and the audiences onshore with real-time video footage from deepwater areas in important, yet largely unknown, U.S. waters.

[[Image:Pelagothuria natatrix Samoa 2.jpg|thumb|A very rare swimming [[sea cucumber]] ''[[Pelagothuria natatrix]]'' observed in 2017.]]
From February to April 2017, NOAA and partners will conducted two telepresence-enabled ocean exploration cruises on NOAA Ship Okeanos Explorer to collect critical baseline information of unknown and poorly known deepwater areas in [[American Samoa]] and [[Samoa]], with an emphasis on [[Rose Atoll Marine National Monument]], [[National Marine Sanctuary of American Samoa]], and [[National Park of American Samoa]].

The 2017 American Samoa Expedition Part 1: Suesuega o le Moana o Amerika Samoa, was a 14-day telepresence-enabled expedition to explore unknown and poorly understood areas in American Samoa and Samoa with a focus on Rose Atoll Marine National Monument and National Marine Sanctuary of American Samoa. 11 ROV dives were conducted from 250 to 4,000 meters depth. 101 biological specimens (31 primary specimens and 80 associates), were collected including corals, anemones, [[Zoantharia |zoanthids]], [[Hydroid (zoology) |hydroids]], sponges, sea stars, feather stars, brittle stars, urchins, [[squat lobster]]s, [[Amphipoda |amphipods]], shrimp, barnacles, snails, and [[Polychaete |polychaete]] worms. As many as 30 of these specimens could represent new species, and most of the specimens from known species will represent new range records. Along with biological specimens, 30 rock samples for age dating and [[Geochemistry |geochemical]] analysis were collected to help reveal the geologic history of American Samoa seamounts, atolls, and islands. The dives also obtained samples from the youngest volcanic structures that formed in the Vailulu'u volcanic crater since the previous mapping survey in 2012. More than 12,000 square kilometers of seafloor was mapped, an area 60 times the land area of American Samoa.

===Windows the Deep 2018: Exploration of the Southeast U.S. Continental Margin  ===
From May 22 through July 2, NOAA and partners conducted a two-part, telepresence-enabled ocean exploration expedition on NOAA Ship Okeanos Explorer to collect critical baseline information about unknown and poorly understood deepwater areas of the Southeastern United States.&lt;ref name=WOD2018&gt;{{cite web|title = Windows of the Deep 2018: Exploration of the Southeast U.S. Continental Margin |url=https://oceanexplorer.noaa.gov/okeanos/explorations/ex1806/background/plan/welcome.html|publisher=NOAA|accessdate=27 June 2018}} {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Map_of_bathymetry_data_SE_US_2018.jpg|thumb|Map of [[bathymetry]] data collected during the first part of the two-part Windows to the Deep 2018: Exploration of the Southeast U.S. Continental Margin expedition.]]
The first leg of this expedition took place from May 22 to June 6 and involved the collection of seafloor and water column mapping data to further improve fundamental understanding in this region and to facilitate remotely operated vehicle (ROV) dive planning. Mapping operations were focused offshore Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina, in the South Atlantic Bight - and more specifically, the [[Blake Plateau]] - over some of the least explored ares along the [[East Coast of the United States]]. During the mission, the team mapped over 4,900 linear kilometers, resulting in complete seafloor bathymetric coverage of over 16,000 square kilometers- an area larger than the states of [[Connecticut]] and [[Rhode Island]] combined, or nearly the size of [[Lake Ontario]]. ROV dives were conducted from July 14 to July 1 during the expedition's second leg.&lt;ref name=WOD2018/&gt;&lt;ref name=Telepresence2018&gt;{{cite web|title = Telepresence Mapping of the Southeast U.S. Continental Margin |url=https://oceanexplorer.noaa.gov/okeanos/explorations/ex1806/background/ex1805/welcome.html|publisher=NOAA|accessdate=27 June 2018}} {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the second leg of the expedition, 24-hour operations consisting of daytime ROV dives with the Deep Discoverer(D2) and overnight mapping. Prior to the first leg of the expedition, there was limited high-resolution multibeam mapping in the deepwater areas offshore the southeastern U.S. Live feeds of the dives could be viewed online in real time.&lt;ref name=WOD2018/&gt;

This was the ninth expedition to test [[telepresence]]-enabled mapping operations on NOAA Ship Okeanos Explorer. For this expedition, the mapping team was split between shipboard and shore-based mission teams based at the Exploration Command Center (ECC) at the [[Center for Coastal &amp; Ocean Mapping|University of New Hampshire's Center for Coastal and Ocean Mapping (UNH CCOM)]].&lt;ref name=Telepresence2018/&gt;

[[File:Interior view - Swedish Museum of Natural History - Stockholm, Sweden - DSC00649.JPG|thumb|Exhibits at the [[Swedish Museum of Natural History]]]]
A '''natural history museum''' or '''museum of natural history''' is a scientific institution with [[natural history]] [[scientific collection|collections]] that include current and historical records of [[animal]]s, [[plant]]s, [[Fungus|fungi]], [[ecosystem]]s, [[geology]], [[paleontology]], [[climatology]], and more.

The primary role of a natural history museum is to provide the scientific community with current and historical specimens for their research, which is to improve our understanding of the natural world. Some museums have public exhibits to share the beauty and wonder of the natural world with the public; these are referred to as 'public museums'. Some museums feature non-natural history collections in addition to their primary collections, such as ones related to history, art, and science. 

Renaissance [[Cabinet of curiosities|cabinets of curiosities]] were private collections that typically included exotic specimens of natural history, sometimes faked, along with other types of object.  The first natural history museum was possibly that of Swiss scholar [[Conrad Gessner]], established in [[Zürich]] in the mid-16th century.&lt;ref name="Resh"&gt;Vincent H. Resh, Ring T. Cardé, ''Encyclopedia of Insects'' (2003), p. 771.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Museum of Natural History (France)|Muséum National d'Histoire Naturelle]], established in [[Paris]] in 1635, was the first natural history museum to take the form that would be recognized as a natural history museum today.&lt;ref name="Resh"/&gt; Early natural history museums offered limited accessibility, as they were generally private collections or holdings of scientific societies.&lt;ref name="Stein"&gt;Andi Stein, Beth Blingham Evans, ''An Introduction to the Entertainment Industry'' (2009), p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ashmolean Museum]], opened in 1683, was the first natural history museum to grant admission to the general public.&lt;ref name="Stein"/&gt;

'''Pharping Hydro Power Project''' is the first hydro-power project of [[Nepal]] and second of [[Asia]]. This is situated in [[Kathmandu]] district.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://trn.gorkhapatraonline.com/index.php/72-science-technology/8389-students-observe-pharping-hydropower-project-as-part-of-water-week.html|title=Students observe Pharping Hydropower Project as part of Water Week|publisher=Gorkhapatra Online (The Rising Nepal)|accessdate=25 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, it was declared a Living Museum by government of Nepal and was open for public.

==History==
Pharping Hydro Power was established in 1911 as '''Chandrajyoti Hydro-electric power station'''  by Prime Minister [[Chandra Shamsher Jang Bahadur Rana]].Plant was inaugurated by King [[Prithvi of Nepal|Prithvi Bir Bikram Shah Dev]] on Monday, 22 May, 1911 at around 6: 30 Pm by turning the lights  on during a program in [[Tudhikhel, Kathmandu]].

==Reservoir==
Currently water from the reservoir lake is  used  for drinking water supply for Lalitpur District. Water is supplied to places like Bhaisipati, Saindu,, Kupondole, etc.

==Nepal Electricity Authority==
[[Nepal Electricity Authority]] took over Chandrajyoti Hydro-electric Power Station and renamed it Pharping Hydro Power Station and had since been smoothly running the power station till the late 1990s when it was considered that the aging power station needed to be converted into a heritage site. In 2010, it was declared a Living Museum by government of Nepal and was open for public.

[[File:Tatry Mapa Plastyczna.JPG|thumb|350px|Hand-made raised-relief map of the [[High Tatras]] in scale 1: 50 000]]
A '''raised-relief map''' or '''terrain model''' is a three-dimensional representation, usually of terrain, materialized as a physical artifact. When representing terrain, the vertical dimension is usually exaggerated by a factor between five and ten; this facilitates the visual recognition of terrain features and velocity.

== History ==
If the account of [[Sima Qian]] (c. 145–86 BCE) in his ''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]'' is proven correct upon the unearthing of [[Qin Shi Huang]]'s tomb, the raised-relief map has existed since the [[Qin dynasty]] (221–206 BCE) of China. [[Joseph Needham]] suggests that certain pottery vessels of the [[Han dynasty]] (202 BCE – 220 CE) showing artificial mountains as lid decorations may have influenced the raised-relief map.&lt;ref name="needham 1986 volume 3 580 581"&gt;Needham (1986), Volume 3, 580–581.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Han dynasty general [[Ma Yuan (Han Dynasty)|Ma Yuan]] made a raised-relief map of valleys and mountains in a rice-constructed model of 32 CE.&lt;ref name="crespigny 2007 659"&gt;Crespigny (2007), 659.&lt;/ref&gt; Such rice models were expounded on by the [[Tang dynasty]] (618–907) author Jiang Fang in his ''Essay on the Art of Constructing Mountains with Rice'' (c. 845). A raised-relief map made of wood representing all the provinces of the empire and put together like a giant {{nowrap|0.93 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} ({{nowrap|10 ft&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}) [[jigsaw puzzle]] was invented by Xie Zhuang (421–466) during the [[Liu Song dynasty]] (420–479).

[[Shen Kuo]] (1031-1095) created a raised-relief map using sawdust, wood, beeswax, and wheat paste.&lt;ref name="sivin III 22"&gt;Sivin (1995), III, 22.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="needham 1986 volume 3 579 580"&gt;Needham (1986), Volume 3, 579–580.&lt;/ref&gt; His wooden model pleased [[Emperor Shenzong of Song]], who later ordered that all the prefects administering the frontier regions should prepare similar wooden maps which could be sent to the capital and stored in an archive.&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 580"&gt;Needham (1986), Volume 3, 580.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1130, Huang Shang made a wooden raised-relief map which later caught the attention of the [[Neo-Confucianism|Neo-Confucian]] philosopher [[Zhu Xi]], who tried to acquire it but instead made his own map out of sticky clay and wood.&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 580"/&gt; The map, made of eight pieces of wood connected by hinges, could be folded up and carried around by one person.&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 580"/&gt;

Later, [[Ibn Battuta]] (1304–1377) described a raised-relief map while visiting [[Gibraltar]]&lt;ref name="needham 1986 volume 3 579"&gt;Needham (1986), Volume 3, 579&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1665 paper for the ''[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society]]'', [[John Evelyn]] (1620–1706) believed that wax models imitating nature and bas relief maps were something entirely new from France.&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 579"&gt;Needham (1986), Volume 3, 579.&lt;/ref&gt; Some later scholars attributed the first raised-relief map to one Paul Dox, who represented the area of [[Kufstein]] in his raised-relief map of 1510.&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 579"/&gt;

==Construction==
There are a number of ways to create a raised-relief map. Each method has advantages and disadvantages in regards to accuracy, price, and relative ease of creation.
===Layer Stacking===
Starting with a [[topographic map]], one can cut out successive layers from some sheet material, with edges following the [[contour line]]s on the map. These may be assembled in a stack to obtain a rough approximation of the terrain. This method is commonly used as the base for architectural models, and is usually done without [[vertical exaggeration]]. For models of landforms, the stack can then be smoothed by filling with some material. This model may be used directly, or for greater durability a mold may be made from it. This mold may then be used to produce a plaster model.
===Vacuum Formed Plastic Maps===
A combination of [[numerical control|computer numerical control]] (CNC) machining a master model, and [[vacuum forming]] copies from this, can be been used to rapidly mass-produce raised-relief maps. The Vacuum Forming technique, invented in 1947 by the Army Map Service in Washington, D.C., uses vacuum-formed plastic sheets and heat to increase the production rate of these maps. To make the Vacuum-Formed plastic maps, first a master model made of resin or other materials is created with a computer guided milling machine using a digital terrain model. Then a reproduction mold is cast using the master mold and a heat and pressure resistant material. Fine holes are put into the reproduction mold so that the air can later be removed by a vacuum. Next, a plastic sheet is applied to the mold so that they are airtight, and a heater is placed above the plastic for about 10 seconds. The vacuum is then applied to remove the remaining air. After letting the plastic cool, it can be removed and the terrain is complete. After this step, a color map can be overlaid/printed onto the bases that were created to make it realistic. &lt;ref name=thermoplastic&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.terrainmodels.com/thermoplastic.html |title=Thermoplastic reliefs |access-date=September 16, 2014 |last= |first= |date= |work=Terrain Models |publisher=Institute of Cartography and Geoinformation, ETH Zurich |location=Zurich |language= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vacuum-formed plastic maps have many advantages and disadvantages. They can be quickly produced, which can be beneficial in time of war or disaster. However, the accuracy of certain points throughout the model can vary. The points that touch the mold first are the most accurate, while the points that touch the mold last can become bulged and slightly distorted. Also, the effectiveness of this particular construction method varies by the terrain being represented. They are not good at representing sharp-edged land forms like high mountain ranges or urban areas. &lt;ref name=thermoplastic /&gt;

===3D Printing===
[[File:mars_elevation.stl|thumb|right|[[STL (file format)|STL model]] of Mars with 20&amp;times; elevation exaggeration for 3D printing]]
Another method which is becoming more widespread is the use of [[3D printing]]. With the rapid development of this technology its use is becoming increasingly economic. In order to create a raised-relief map using a 3D printer, [[Digital Elevation Model]]s (DEM) are rendered into a 3D computer model, which can then be sent to a 3D printer. Most consumer-level 3D printers extrude plastic layer by layer to create a 3D object. However, if a map is needed for commercial and professional uses, higher-end printers can be used. These 3D printers use a combination of powders, resins, and even metals to create higher-quality models. After the model is created, color can be added to show different land cover characteristics, providing a more realistic view of the area.  Some benefits of using a 3D printed model include the technology and DEMs being more prevalent easier to find, and that they are easier to understand than a typical topographic map.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last1=Horowitz |first1=Seth |last2=Schultz |first2=Peter |title=Printing Space: Using 3D Printing of Digital Terrain Models in Geosciences, Education and Research |year= |date=February 26, 2014 |magazine=Journal of Geoscience Education |volume=62 |issue=1 |pages=138-145 |location= |publisher=National Association of Geoscience Teachers |language= |issn=1089-9995 |accessdate=July 30, 2018 |url=https://nasa3d.arc.nasa.gov/assets/static/HorowitzSchultz2014.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-terrain applications==
For appropriate [[mathematical function]]s and especially for certain types of [[statistics]] displays, a similar model may be constructed as an aid to understanding a function or as an aid to studying the statistical data.

==Notable examples==
The [[Great Polish Map of Scotland]] is claimed to be the largest terrain relief model, constructed out of brick and concrete in the grounds of a hotel near [[Peebles]], [[Scotland]]. It measures {{convert|50|x|40|m}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Bruce Gittings|author2=Royal Scottish Geographical Society|title=Polish Map of Scotland|url=http://www.scottish-places.info/features/featurefirst19323.html|work=Gazetteer for Scotland|publisher=The Editors of The Gazetteer for Scotland|accessdate=2012-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, a site in [[Ningxia province, China]] was spotted in 2006 using satellite imagery. It measured {{convert|900|x|700|m}}, had a {{convert|3|km|adj=on}} perimeter and appeared to be a large scale relief model of [[Aksai Chin]], a disputed territory between China and India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Chinese X-file not so mysterious after all|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/web/chinese-xfile-not-so-mysterious-after-all/2006/07/23/1153593217781.html|accessdate=2012-07-26|newspaper=The Age (Melbourne)|date=July 23, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Samoan tropical moist forests''' are a [[Tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests|tropical moist broadleaf forest]] [[ecoregion]] in the [[Samoan Islands]]. They cover an area of {{convert|3100|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}.

The '''Central Savai'i Rainforest''', comprising an area of {{convert|727|km2|sqmi}} on the island of [[Savai'i]] in the Samoan Islands, is the largest continuous patch of rainforest in [[Polynesia]]. The area contains more than 100 [[volcanic craters]] including recent lava flows. There are three broad types of rainforests, the most extensive is [[lowland]] forest, followed by montane and [[cloud forest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{WWF ecoregion|id=oc0112|name=Samoa tropical moist forests|accessdate=3 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rainforest spans the inland region of the island and contains most of [[Samoa]]'s [[Endemism|endemic]] native species, many of which are threatened or near extinction.&lt;ref name=sprep/&gt;

These include the rare and unusual [[tooth-billed pigeon]] (''Didinculus strigirostris'') known locally as manumea, the national bird of Samoa and other birds such as the [[Mao (bird)|maomao]] honeyeater&lt;ref name=sprep&gt;{{cite web|url=http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:4JBzHeBkkYcJ:www.sprep.org/att/IRC/eCOPIES/Countries/Samoa/191.pdf+Conservation+areas+in+Samoa&amp;cd=7&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=nz|work=Conservation International - Pacific Islands Programme, Samoa Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment, Secretariat of the Pacific Regional Environment Programme|title=Report:Vaega Fa’atauainamole Fa’asaoi Samoa, Priority Sites for Con-servation in Samoa: Key Biodiversity Areas|editor=James Atherton|year=2010|accessdate=3 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; (''Gymnomyza samoensis''). The [[Samoan white-eye]] (''Zosterops samoensis'') and [[Samoan wood rail|Samoan moorhen]] (''Gallinula pacifica'') are both endemic to Savai'i. The Samoan moorhen was last recorded in 1873 with possible sightings in 1984 at the upland forests and at [[Silisili|Mount Silisili]] in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.birdlife.org|work=Birdlife International|title=Species factsheet|year=2010|accessdate=3 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, [[Samoa]] ratified the international and legally binding treaty, the [[Convention on Biological Diversity]] to develop national strategies for conservation and sustainable use of [[biological diversity]]. As of 2010, protected areas in the country covered 5% of land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.islandsbusiness.com/home_samoa/index_dynamic/containerNameToReplace=MiddleMiddle/focusModuleID=130/focusContentID=19492/tableName=mediaRelease/overideSkinName=newsArticle-full.tpl |work=Islands Business |title=Samoa struggling with biodiversity goals |date=19 May 2010 |accessdate=3 July 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100526072315/http://islandsbusiness.com/home_samoa/index_dynamic/containerNameToReplace%3DMiddleMiddle/focusModuleID%3D130/focusContentID%3D19492/tableName%3DmediaRelease/overideSkinName%3DnewsArticle-full.tpl |archivedate=26 May 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Approximately 30% of Samoa's biodiversity is endemic, found only in Samoa, with new species still being discovered including two new butterflies in 2009 and freshwater fish new to science. The country has more native species of ferns and butterflies than [[New Zealand]], a country 85 times larger.&lt;ref name=sprep/&gt;

Most of Samoa's land is under [[customary land|customary]] ownership, about 81% of which is governed at the local level by ''[[fa'amatai|matai]]'', the chiefly heads of families.&lt;ref name=af&gt;{{cite encyclopedia

'''Solar power in India''' is a fast developing industry.

In addition to its large-scale grid-connected solar PV initiative, India is developing off-grid solar power for local energy needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/solar-water-pumps-can-help-india-surpass-100-gw-target-report/articleshow/65214158.cms|title=Solar water pumps can help India surpass 100 GW target: Report |accessdate= 2 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Solar products have increasingly helped to meet rural needs; by the end of 2015 just under one million [[Solar lamp|solar lanterns]] were sold in the country, reducing the need for kerosene.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mnre.gov.in/file-manager/annual-report/2015-2016/EN/Chapter%201/chapter_1.htm |title=Ministry of New and Renewable Energy, Annual Report 2015-2016 |date= |website= |publisher= |access-date=2017-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; That year, 118,700 solar home lighting systems were installed and 46,655 solar street lighting installations were provided under a national program;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; just over 1.4 million [[solar cooker]]s were distributed in India.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In January 2016, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and French President [[François Hollande]] laid the foundation stone for the headquarters of the [[Sunshine countries|International Solar Alliance]] (ISA) in [[Gwal Pahari]], [[Gurgaon]]. The ISA will focus on promoting and developing solar energy and solar products for countries lying wholly or partially between the [[Tropic of Cancer]] and the [[Tropic of Capricorn]]. The alliance of over 120 countries was announced at the Paris COP21 climate summit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.alternet.org/environment/india-unveils-global-solar-alliance-120-countries-paris-climate-summit |title=India Unveils Global Solar Alliance of 120 Countries at Paris Climate Summit |last=Neslen |first=Arthur |date=2015-12-04 |newspaper=AlterNet |access-date=2016-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; One hope of the ISA is that wider deployment will reduce production and development costs, facilitating the increased deployment of solar technologies to poor and remote regions.

A report published by the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA)&lt;ref&gt;[http://ieefa.org/ Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis]&lt;/ref&gt; found that India installed 10 GW of solar in 2017, almost double its record in 2016.

=={{anchor|Photovoltaic solar growth forecasts}}Solar photovoltaic growth forecasts==
In August 2016, the [[Growth of photovoltaics|forecast for solar photovoltaic]] installations was about 4.8 GW for the calendar year. About 2.8 GW was installed in the first eight months of 2016, more than all 2015 solar installations. India's solar projects stood at about 21 GW, with about 14 GW under construction and about 7 GW to be auctioned.&lt;ref&gt;http://mercomcapital.com/solar-installations-in-india-to-reach-4.8-gw-in-2016-with-a-21-gw-development-pipeline&lt;/ref&gt; The country's solar capacity  reached 19.7 GW by the end of 2017, making it the third-largest global solar market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://mercomindia.com/states-accounted-75-percent-indias-installations-2017/ |title=Four States Accounted for 75 Percent of India's Utility-Scale Solar Installations in 2017 |accessdate=14 March 2018|date=2018-03-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In mid-2018 the Indian power minister RK Singh flagged a tender for a 100GW solar plant at an event in Delhi, while discussing a 10GW tender due to be issued in July that year (at the time, a world record). He also increased the government target for installed renewable energy by 2022 to 227GW.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Safi |first1=Michael |title=India's huge solar ambitions could push coal further into shade |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/30/indias-huge-solar-ambitions-could-push-coal-further-into-shade |accessdate=30 June 2018 |work=The Guardian |agency=Guardian News and Media Limited}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Solar thermal power==
[[File:PS10 solar power tower.jpg|thumb|Solar thermal power plant with a field of [[heliostat]]s and a central [[solar power tower]].]]
The installed capacity of commercial [[concentrated solar power|solar thermal power]] plants (non storage type) in India is 227.5 MW with 50 MW in Andhra Pradesh and 177.5 MW in Rajasthan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.energystorageexchange.org/projects/669 |title=DOE Energy storage database |accessdate=2017-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S1364032116300570-gr8.jpg |title=Direct Normal Irradiance in India |accessdate=2017-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Solar thermal plants with thermal storage are emerging as cheaper (US 6.1 ¢/kWh or Rs 3.97/KWh) and clean [[load following power plant]]s to supply electricity round the clock,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://helioscsp.com/solarreserve-awarded-au78mwh-concentrated-solar-power-contract/|title=Solar Reserve awarded AU$78/MWh Concentrated Solar Power contract |accessdate= 23 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://helioscsp.com/15-gw-concentrated-solar-power-projects-to-compete-for-china-2nd-batch-pilot-projects/|title=15 GW Concentrated Solar Power projects to compete for China 2nd batch pilot projects |accessdate= 9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; working as [[dispatchable generation]].&lt;ref name=sther&gt;{{cite web |url=http://reneweconomy.com.au/aurora-what-you-should-know-about-port-augustas-solar-power-tower-86715/|title=Aurora: What you should know about Port Augusta's solar power-tower |accessdate= 22 August 2017|date=2017-08-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Proper mix of solar thermal (thermal storage type) and [[solar PV]] can fully match the load fluctuations without the need of costly battery storage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://solarthermalmagazine.com/2017/07/19/solarreserve-receives-environmental-approval-390-megawatt-solar-thermal-facility-storage-chile/|title=SolarReserve receives environmental approval 390 MW solar thermal facility storage in Chile |accessdate= 29 August 2017|date=2017-07-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://cleantechnica.com/2017/03/13/solarreserve-bids-24-hour-solar-6-3-cents-chile/|title=SolarReserve Bids 24-Hour Solar At 6.3 Cents In Chile |accessdate= 29 August 2017|date=2017-03-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The existing solar thermal power plants (non-storage type) in India, which are generating costly intermittent power on daily basis, can be converted into storage type solar thermal plants to generate 3 to 4 times more baseload power at cheaper cost and not depend on government subsidies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/is-csp-viable-without-storage#gs.9UN2YLg|title=Concentrating Solar Power Isn't Viable Without Storage, Say Experts |accessdate= 29 August 2017|date=November 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hybrid solar plants==
Solar power, generated mainly during the daytime in the non-monsoon period, complements wind which generate power during the monsoon months in India.{{cn|date=December 2018}}
Solar panels can be located in the space between the towers of [[Wind power in India|wind-power plants]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://energy.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/renewable/siemens-gamesa-bags-wind-solar-hydrid-energy-project-in-karnataka/60841883|title=Siemens Gamesa bags Wind-Solar hybrid energy project in Karnataka |accessdate= 28 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also complements hydroelectricity, generated primarily during India's monsoon months. Solar-power plants can be installed near existing hydropower and [[pumped-storage hydroelectricity]], utilizing the existing power transmission infrastructure and storing the surplus secondary power generated by the solar PV plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://energy.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/renewable/shapoorji-pallonji-bags-countrys-first-large-scale-floating-solar-project/66837326|title=Shapoorji Pallonji bags country's first large-scale floating solar project |accessdate= 28 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.powermag.com/integrated-solar-hydro-project-takes-float/|title=Integrated Solar-Hydro Project Takes Float |accessdate= 1 September 2017|date=September 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the daytime, the additional auxiliary power consumption of a solar thermal storage power plant is nearly 10% of its rated capacity for the process of extracting solar energy in the form of thermal energy.&lt;ref name=sther/&gt; This auxiliary power requirement can be made available from cheaper solar PV plant by envisaging hybrid solar plant with a mix of solar thermal and solar PV plants at a site. Also to optimise the cost of power, generation can be from the cheaper solar PV plant (33% generation) during the daylight whereas the rest of the time in a day is from the solar thermal storage plant (67% generation from [[Solar power tower]] and [[parabolic trough]] types) for meeting 24 hours baseload power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://cleantechnica.com/2015/08/25/cheap-baseload-solar-copiapo-gets-ok-chile-exclusive-info/|title=Cheap Baseload Solar At Copiapó Gets OK In Chile  |accessdate= 1 September 2017|date=2015-08-25  }}&lt;/ref&gt; When solar thermal storage plant is forced to idle due to lack of sunlight locally during cloudy days in monsoon season, it is also possible to consume (similar to a lesser efficient, huge capacity and low cost battery storage system) the cheap excess grid power when the grid frequency is above 50 [[Hertz|hz]] for heating the hot molten salt to higher temperature for converting stored thermal energy in to electricity during the peak demand hours when the electricity sale price is profitable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2017/apr/06/salt-silicon-or-graphite-energy-storage-goes-beyond-lithium-ion-batteries|title=Salt, silicon or graphite: energy storage goes beyond lithium ion batteries  |accessdate= 1 September 2017|newspaper=The Guardian  |date=2017-04-05  |last1=Lewis  |first1=Dyani  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/articles/print/volume-18/issue-110/features/thermal-renewable-energy/commercializing-standalone-thermal-energy-storage.html|title=Commercializing Standalone Thermal Energy Storage |accessdate= 1 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rural electrification==
The lack of an electricity infrastructure is a hurdle to rural India's development. India's power grid is under-developed, with large groups of people still living off the grid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.firstpost.com/living/dc-solar-products-are-lighting-up-rural-india-whats-driving-the-increased-demand-3386812.html |title=DC solar products are lighting up rural India: What's driving the increased demand? |accessdate=2017-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, about 80,000 of the nation's villages still did not have electricity; of them, 18,000 could not be electrified by extending the conventional grid. A target of electrifying 5,000 such villages was set for the [[Five-Year Plans of India#Tenth Plan (2002–2007)|2002–2007 Five-Year Plan]]. By 2004 more than 2,700 villages and hamlets were electrified, primarily with solar photovoltaic systems.&lt;ref name="SPSEPRIE" /&gt; The development of inexpensive solar technology is considered a potential alternative, providing an electricity infrastructure consisting of a network of local-grid clusters with distributed electricity generation.&lt;ref name="ecoworld" &gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ecoworld.com/products/electronics/indias-solar-power.html |title=India's Solar Power: Greening India's Future Energy Demand |publisher=Ecoworld.com |date=2007-05-15 |accessdate=2012-02-28 |first=Avilash |last=Roul}}&lt;/ref&gt; It could bypass (or relieve) expensive, long-distance, centralized power-delivery systems, bringing inexpensive electricity to large groups of people. In Rajasthan during FY2016-17, 91 villages have been electrified with a solar standalone system and over 6,200 households have received a 100W solar home-lighting system.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

==={{anchor|Solar lamps and lighting}}Lamps and lighting===
By 2012, a total of 4,600,000 solar lanterns and 861,654 solar-powered home lights were installed. Typically replacing kerosene lamps, they can be purchased for the cost of a few months' worth of kerosene with a small loan. The Ministry of New and Renewable Energy is offering a 30- to 40-percent subsidy of the cost of lanterns, home lights and small systems (up to 210 [[Nominal power (photovoltaic)#Watt-peak|W&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://pib.nic.in/newsite/pmreleases.aspx?mincode=28 Government Provides 30% subsidy for Solar Lanterns and Home Lights]&lt;/ref&gt; Twenty million solar lamps are expected by 2022.&lt;ref name=actionplan&gt;[http://pib.nic.in/newsite/erelease.aspx?relid=83632 Action Plan to Increase Renewable Energy]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Agricultural support===
Solar photovoltaic water-pumping systems are used for irrigation and drinking water.&lt;ref name= modpri&gt;{{cite web |url=https://cleantechnica.com/2017/10/23/indian-module-makers-beat-chinese-prices-300-megawatt-tender/ |title=Indian Module Makers Beat Chinese Prices In 300 Megawatt Tender |accessdate=23 October 2017|date=2017-10-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most pumps are fitted with a {{convert|200|–|3000|W|hp|abbr=on}} motor powered with a 1,800 W&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; PV array which can deliver about {{convert|140,000|l|USgal}} of water per day from a total [[hydraulic head]] of {{convert|10|m|ft|abbr=on}}.

===Rainwater harvesting===
In addition to solar energy, rainwater is a major [[renewable resource]] of any area. 
In India, large areas are being covered by solar PV panels every year. 
Solar panels can also be used for harvesting most of the rainwater falling on them and drinking-quality water, free from bacteria and suspended matter, can be generated by simple [[Water purification|filtration and disinfection]] processes, as rainwater is very low in [[salinity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rain fed solar-powered water purification systems. |url=http://www.windpowerengineering.com/environmental/wind-solar-powered-offgridbox-useful-hurricane-passes/|accessdate=21 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://inhabitat.com/new-rooftop-solar-hydropanels-harvest-drinking-water-and-energy-at-the-same-time/  |title=New rooftop solar hydro panels harvest drinking water and energy at the same time |accessdate=2017-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Good quality water resources, closer to populated areas, are becoming a scarcity and increasingly costly for consumers. 
Exploitation of rainwater for value-added products like bottled drinking water makes solar PV power plants profitable even in high rainfall and cloudy areas by the increased income from drinking water generation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Inverted Umbrella Brings Clean Water &amp; Clean Power To India |url=https://cleantechnica.com/2017/12/04/inverted-umbrella-brings-clean-water-clean-power-india/|accessdate=5 December 2017|date=2017-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thin-film solar cell]] panels offer better performance than crystalline silica solar panels in tropical hot and dusty places like India; there is less deterioration in conversion efficiency with increased ambient temperature, and no partial shading effect. These factors enhance the performance and reliability (fire safety) of thin-film panels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-educationplus/now-solar-energy-can-power-air-conditioner-refrigerator/article8378355.ece |title=Now, solar energy can power air conditioner, refrigerator |accessdate=2016-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Thin Film Solar PV vs Silicon Wafer – Which is Better? |url=http://www.solarblogger.net/2016/10/thin-film-solar-pv-vs-silicon-wafer.html |accessdate=2017-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Panasonic HIT solar module achieves world's best output temperature coefficient |url=http://www.solarpowerworldonline.com/2017/06/panasonic-hit-solar-module-achieves-worlds-best-output-temperature-coefficient/ |accessdate=2017-06-22|date=2017-06-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Maximum solar-electricity generation during the hot hours of the day can be used for meeting residential air-conditioning requirements regardless of other load requirements, such as refrigeration, lighting, cooking and water pumping. Power generation of photovoltaic modules can be increased by 17 to 20 percent by equipping them with a [[Solar tracker|tracking system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= The use of solar trackers is picking up fast in India |url=http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/specials/clean-tech/moving-with-the-sun/article8812097.ece |accessdate=2016-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Bifacial Plus Tracking Boosts Solar Energy Yield by 27 Percent |url=https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/bifacial-plus-tracking-boosts-solar-energy-yield-by-27-percent#gs.zVmaRi8 |accessdate=19 April 2018|date=2018-04-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Residential electricity consumers who are paying higher slab rates more than {{INRConvert|5}} per unit, can form in to local groups to install collectively roof top off-grid solar power units (without much battery storage) and replace the costly power used from the grid with the solar power as and when produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Solar power essential data |url=https://www.itsmysun.com/solar-essentials/ |accessdate=19 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence power drawl from the grid which is an assured power supply without much power cuts nowadays, serves as cheaper back up source when grid power consumption is limited to lower slab rate by using solar power during the day time. The maximum power generation of solar panels during the sunny daytime is complementary with the enhanced residential electricity consumption during the hot/summer days due to higher use of cooling appliances such as fans, refrigerators, air conditioners, desert coolers, etc. It would discourage the Discoms to extract higher electricity charges selectively from its consumers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title= Rs 3 per KWh – lowest tariff for third-party rooftop solar power installations |url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/chandigarh-himachal-uttarakhand-to-get-cheapest-power-gujarat-to-costliest/articleshow/54926741.cms |accessdate=2016-10-19|newspaper=The Economic Times |date=2016-10-19 |last1=Sengupta |first1=Debjoy }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no need of any permission from Discoms similar to [[Standby generator|DG power sets]] installation.

Fifty-one solar radiation resource assessment stations have been installed across India by the [[Ministry of New and Renewable Energy]] (MNRE) to create a database of solar-energy potential. Data is collected and reported to the Centre for Wind Energy Technology (C-WET) to create a solar atlas. In June 2015, India began a {{INRConvert|40|c}} project to measure solar radiation with a [[Angular resolution|spatial resolution]] of {{convert|3|x|3|km}}. This solar-radiation measuring network will provide the basis for the Indian solar-radiation atlas. According to National Institute of Wind Energy officials, the Solar Radiation Resource Assessment wing (121 ground stations) would measure solar radiation's three parameters—Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI), Direct Normal Irradiance (DNI) and Diffuse Horizontal Irradiance (DHI)—to accurately measure a region's solar radiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/chennai/Solar-Radiation-Measuring-Network-Atlas-Out-in-the-Open/2015/06/04/article2848559.ece |title=Solar radiation measuring network in India|accessdate=4 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://niwe.res.in/indian_solar_atlas.php|title=Solar radiation data collection agency in India|accessdate=4 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Indian government is promoting solar energy. It announced an allocation of {{INRConvert|1000|c}} for the [[Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar Mission]] and a clean-energy fund for the 2010-11 fiscal year, an increase of {{INRConvert|380|c}} from the previous budget. The budget encouraged private solar companies by reducing the import duty on solar panels by five percent. This is expected to reduce the cost of a rooftop solar-panel installation by 15 to 20 percent.

#Viability Gap Funding: Under the reverse bidding process, bidders who need least viability gap funding at the reference tariff (RS 4.93 per unit in 2016) is selected.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/cabinet-clears-viability-gap-funding-for-5-000-mw-solar-power-projects-116012000821_1.html|title=Cabinet clears viability gap funding for 5,000 Mw solar power projects|last=Jai|first=Shreya|date=2016-01-20|work=Business Standard India|access-date=2018-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Funding was Rs 1 Crore/MW for open projects on average in 2016. 
#Accelerated depreciation: For profit-making enterprises installing rooftop solar systems, 40 percent of the total investment could be claimed as depreciation in the first year (decreasing taxes).
#To protect the local solar panel manufacturers, 25% safe guard duty is imposed for two years period from August 2018 on the imports from China &amp; Malaysia who are suspected of dumping solar panels in to India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://energy.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/renewable/india-imposes-safeguard-duty-on-solar-cells-imports-for-two-years/65206347 |title=India imposes safeguard duty on solar cells imports for two years|accessdate=31 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Capital subsidies were applicable to rooftop solar-power plants up to a maximum of 500&amp;nbsp;kW. The 30-percent subsidy was reduced to 15 percent.
#Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs): Tradeable certificates providing financial incentives for every unit of green power generated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mnre.gov.in/pdf/MNRE_REC_Report.pdf Report On Development of Conceptual Framework For Renewable Energy Certificate Mechanism for India]&lt;/ref&gt;
#[[Net metering]] incentives depend on whether a net meter is installed and the utility's incentive policy. If so, financial incentives are available for the power generated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.solarmango.com/ask/2015/07/29/incentives-available-for-rooftop-solar-installations-in-india/ Government Incentives for Rooftop Solar Installation in India]&lt;/ref&gt;
#Assured Power Purchase Agreement (PPA): The power-distribution and -purchase companies owned by state and central governments guarantee the purchase of solar PV power when produced only during daylight. The PPAs offer fair market determined tariff for the solar power which is a secondary power or negative [[Load profile|load]] and an [[intermittent energy source]] on a daily basis.

[[File:Street in Trinidad 2.jpg|thumb|280px|A street in [[Trinidad (Cuba)|Trinidad]], Cuba, in 2006]]
The '''Special Period in Time of Peace''' ({{lang-es|Período especial}}) in [[Cuba]] was an extended period of [[economic crisis]] that began in 1989&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Henken |first=Ted |date=2008 |title=Cuba: A Global Studies Handbook |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Mv7anQoCbzgC&amp;lpg=PT467&amp;ots=v_i5kpr7cw&amp;dq=%22Per%C3%ADodo%20especial%22%20%221990%22%20-wikipedia&amp;pg=PT467#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Per%C3%ADodo%20especial%22%20%221990%22%20-wikipedia&amp;f=false |publisher=ABC-CLIO |page=438 |isbn=9781851099849 |accessdate=30 June 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; primarily due to the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] and, by extension, the [[Comecon]]. The [[economic depression]] of the Special Period was at its most severe in the early to mid-1990s before slightly declining in severity towards the end of the decade once [[Hugo Chávez]]'s [[Venezuela]] emerged as Cuba's primary trading partner and diplomatic ally and especially after the year 2000 once [[Cuba-Russia relations]] improved under the presidency of [[Vladimir Putin]]. It was defined primarily by the severe shortages of [[hydrocarbon]] energy resources in the form of [[gasoline]], [[Diesel fuel|diesel]], and other [[petroleum]] derivatives that occurred upon the implosion of economic agreements between the petroleum-rich [[Soviet Union]] and Cuba. The period radically transformed Cuban society and the economy, as it necessitated the successful introduction of [[sustainable agriculture]], decreased use of [[automobile]]s, and overhauled industry, health, and diet countrywide. People were forced to live without many goods they had become used to.

==Overview==
[[Image:Cuba-oil-production.png|right|thumb|350px|center|Cuban oil production and consumption]]

The [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] hit the [[economy of Cuba|Cuban economy]] severely. The country lost approximately 80% of its imports, 80% of its exports and its Gross Domestic Product dropped by 34%. [[Food]] and [[medicine]] imports stopped or severely slowed. The largest immediate impact was the loss of nearly all of the [[petroleum]] imports from the [[USSR]];&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; Cuba's oil imports dropped to 10% of pre-1990 amounts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historyofcuba.com/history/havana/lperez2.htm|title=Cuba's Special Period&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before this, Cuba had been re-exporting any Soviet petroleum it did not consume to other nations for profit, meaning that petroleum had been Cuba's second largest export product before 1990. Once the restored [[Russian Federation]] emerged from the former [[Soviet Union]], its administration immediately made clear that it had no intention of delivering petroleum that had been guaranteed the island by the USSR; this resulted in a decrease in Cuban consumption by 20% of its previous level within two years.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 &lt;/ref&gt; The effect was felt immediately. Entirely dependent on [[fossil fuel]]s to operate, the major underpinnings of Cuban society—its [[transport]], industrial and agricultural systems—were paralyzed. There were extensive losses of productivity in both [[Cuban agriculture]]—which was dominated by modern industrial [[tractor]]s, [[Combine harvester|combines]], and [[harvester (forestry)|harvesters]], all of which required petroleum to run—and in Cuban industrial capacity.

The early stages of the Special Period were defined by a general breakdown in transportation and agricultural sectors, fertilizer and pesticide stocks (both of those being manufactured primarily from petroleum derivatives), and widespread food shortages. [[Australia]]n and other [[permaculture|permaculturists]] arriving in Cuba at the time began to distribute aid and taught their techniques to locals, who soon implemented them in Cuban fields, raised beds, and urban rooftops across the nation. [[Organic agriculture]] was soon after mandated by the Cuban government, supplanting the old industrialized form of agriculture Cubans had grown accustomed to. [[Transformation in economics#Relocalization|Relocalization]], [[permaculture]], and innovative modes of [[mass transit]] had to be rapidly developed. For a time, waiting for a [[bus]] could take three hours, power outages could last up to sixteen hours, [[food]] consumption was cut back to one-fifth of its previous level and the average Cuban lost about nine kilograms (twenty pounds).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Donovan |first=Sandy |last2=Rao |first2=Sujay |last3=Sandmann |first3=Alexa L. |date=2008 |title=Teens in Cuba |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8YzDOtRjNlcC&amp;lpg=PT14&amp;dq=cuban%20lost%20kilograms&amp;pg=PT14#v=onepage&amp;q=cuban%20lost%20kilograms&amp;f=false |publisher=Capstone |page=26 |isbn=9780756538514 |accessdate=1 July 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although [[starvation]] was avoided, persistent [[hunger]], something not seen since before the [[Cuban Revolution]], suddenly became a daily experience, and initially, [[malnutrition]] in children under five was evident after just a few weeks of these food shortages.

At the time, United States law allowed [[humanitarian aid]] in the form of [[food]] and medicine by private groups. Then in March 1996, the [[Helms-Burton Act]] imposed further penalties on foreign companies doing [[business]] in Cuba, and allowed U.S. citizens to sue foreign investors who use American-owned property seized by the [[Cuba#Government and politics|Cuban government]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hillyard |first=Mick |last2=Miller |first2=Vaughne |date=14 December 1998 |title=Cuba and the Helms-Burton Act |url=http://www.parliament.uk/commons/lib/research/rp98/rp98-114.pdf |journal=House of Commons Library Research Papers |publisher=Great Britain.

The Cuban government was also forced to contract out more lucrative economic and [[tourism]] deals with various [[Western Europe]]an and [[South America]]n nations in an attempt to earn the foreign currency necessary to replace the lost Soviet petroleum via the international markets. Additionally faced with a near-elimination of imported [[steel]] and other [[ore]]-based supplies, Cuba closed refineries and factories across the country, eliminating the country's industrial arm and millions of jobs. The government then proceeded to replace these lost jobs with employment in [[industrial agriculture]] and other homegrown initiatives, but these jobs often did not pay as well, and Cubans on the whole became economically poorer. Alternative transport, most notably the Cuban "camels"—immense 18-wheeler tractor trailers retrofitted as passenger [[bus]]es meant to carry hundreds of Cubans each—flourished. Food-wise, meat and dairy products, having been extremely fossil fuel dependent in their former [[factory farming]] methods, soon diminished in the Cuban diet. In a shift notable for being generally anathema to [[Latin America]]n food habits, the people of the island by necessity adopted diets higher in [[fiber]], fresh produce, and ultimately more [[vegan]] in character. No longer needing [[sugar]] as desperately for a [[cash crop]]—the oil-for-sugar program the Soviets had contracted with Cuba had, of course, dissipated—Cuba hurriedly diversified its agricultural production, utilizing former [[sugarcane|cane]] fields to grow consumables such as [[orange (fruit)|oranges]] and other [[fruit]] and [[vegetable]]s. The Cuban government also focused more intensely on cooperation with [[Venezuela]] once the [[socialist]] [[Hugo Chávez]] was elected [[president]] in 1998.

===Famine===
Cubans had to resort to eating anything they could find.&lt;ref&gt;

Cows in the island were eaten. Before 1959, Cuba boasted as many cattle as people. Today meat is so scarce that it is a crime to kill and eat a cow.&lt;ref name="overdue"&gt;{{cite news|date=December 30, 2008|publisher=The Economist|title=Fifty years of the Castro regime – Time for a (long overdue) change|url=http://www.economist.com/opinion/displaystory.cfm?story_id=12853934}}&lt;/ref&gt; To combat illegal cow eating, the government established harsh penalties. A person can get more jail time for killing a cow (10 years in prison) than killing a human.&lt;ref name="slaughter"/&gt; Those who sell beef without government permission can get three to eight years in prison.&lt;ref name="slaughter"/&gt; Eaters of illegal beef can get three months to one year in prison.&lt;ref name="slaughter"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalexchange.org/countries/americas/cuba/2169.html|title=Drought and slaughter hurt Cuba's once-rich beef, milk industries|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090406145135/http://www.globalexchange.org/countries/americas/cuba/2169.html|archivedate=2009-04-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Special Period's malnutrition created epidemics, but it had positive effects too. Manuel Franco describes the Special Period as "the first, and probably the only, natural experiment, born of unfortunate circumstances, where large effects on diabetes, cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality have been related to sustained population-wide weight loss as a result of increased physical activity and reduced caloric intake".&lt;ref name="francocrisis"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/sep/27/cuba.international|title=Economic crisis boost to health of Cubans|publisher=The Guardian | location=London | first=Rory | last=Carroll | date=September 27, 2007 | accessdate=May 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A paper in the [[American Journal of Epidemiology]], says that "during 1997-2002, there were declines in deaths attributed to diabetes (51%), coronary heart disease (35%), stroke (20%), and all causes (18%). An outbreak of neuropathy and a modest increase in the all-cause death rate among the elderly were also observed."&lt;ref name="cubaHealth"&gt;{{cite journal|date=2007-09-19|journal= American Journal of Epidemiology|title=Impact of energy intake, physical activity, and population-wide weight loss on cardiovascular disease and diabetes mortality in Cuba, 1980-2005.|pmid=17881386|doi=10.1093/aje/kwm226|volume=166|issue=12|pages=1374–80 | last1 = Franco | first1 = M | last2 = Orduñez | first2 = P | last3 = Caballero | first3 = B | display-authors = 3 | last4 = et al}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was caused by how the population tried to reduce the energy store without reducing the nutritional value of the food.&lt;ref name="cubaHealth" /&gt;

A letter published in the [[Canadian Medical Association Journal]] (CMAJ) criticizes the American Journal of Epidemiology for not taking all factors into account and says that "The famine in Cuba during the Special Period was caused by political and economic factors similar to the ones that caused a [[North Korean famine|famine in North Korea]] in the mid-1990s. Both countries were run by authoritarian regimes that denied ordinary people the food to which they were entitled when the public food distribution collapsed; priority was given to the elite classes and the military. In North Korea, 3%–5% of the population died; in Cuba the death rate among the elderly increased by 20% from 1982 to 1993." All editorial matter in CMAJ represents the opinions of the authors and not necessarily those of the Canadian Medical Association or its subsidiaries. In this article the author's name has been withheld in order to safeguard her or his right to free communication&lt;ref name="cmajspecialperiod"/&gt;. The regime did not accept American donations of food, medicines and cash until 1993.&lt;ref name="cmajspecialperiod"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=2474886|title=Health consequences of Cuba's Special Period|publisher=Canadian Medical Association Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thirty thousand Cubans fled the country; thousands drowned or were killed by sharks."&lt;ref name="cmajspecialperiod"/&gt;

Nutrition fell from 3,052&amp;nbsp;calories per day in 1989 to 2,099&amp;nbsp;calories per day in 1993. Other reports indicate even lower figures, 1,863&amp;nbsp;calories per day. Some estimated that the very old and children received only 1,450&amp;nbsp;calories per day.&lt;ref name="fas"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fas.usda.gov/itp/cuba/CubaSituation0308.pdf |title=Cuba’s Food &amp; Agriculture Situation Report |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130312234248/http://www.fas.usda.gov/itp/cuba/CubaSituation0308.pdf |archivedate=2013-03-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The recommended minimum is 2,100–2,300&amp;nbsp;calories

==August 5, 1994 protest==
{{Main article|August 1994 protest in Cuba}}
Hundreds of Cubans protested in Havana on August 5, 1994, some chanting "Libertad!" ("Freedom"). The protest, in which some threw rocks at police, was dispersed by the police after a few hours.&lt;ref name="cancubachange"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.journalofdemocracy.org/articles/gratis/Gutierrez-20-1.pdf|title=Can Cuba Change?|author=Carl Gershman and Orlando Gutierrez|journal=Journal of Democracy January 2009| volume = 20 |issue = 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; A paper published in the ''Journal of Democracy'' argues that this was the closest that the Cuban opposition could come to asserting itself decisively.&lt;ref name="cancubachange"/&gt;

==Government response==
Immediate actions taken by the government included televising an announcement of the expected [[energy crisis]] a week before the [[USSR]] notified the [[Cuba#Government and politics|Cuban government]] that they would not be delivering the expected quota of [[crude oil]]. [[Citizen]]s were asked to reduce their [[consumption (economics)|consumption]] in all areas and to use [[public transport]] and [[carpooling]]. As time went on, the administration developed more structured strategies to manage the long-term energy/economic crisis as it stretched into the 21st century.&lt;ref name="poc_cuba"/&gt;

===Food rationing===
{{See also|Rationing in Cuba}}

[[Food rationing]] intensified. Monthly allocations for families were based on basic minimum requirements as recommended by the [[United Nations]]. However, at the worst of times, the rations comprised only one fifth of these consumption amounts.

=== Housing, land distribution, and urban planning ===
The cost of producing [[cement]] and the scarcity of [[tool]]s and of building materials increased the pressure on already overcrowded housing. Even before the [[energy crisis]], extended families lived in small apartments (many of which were in very poor condition) to be closer to an urban area. To help alleviate this situation, [[Cuba#Government and politics|the government]] engaged in land-distribution where they supplemented larger government-owned [[farm]]s with privately owned ones. Small homes were built in rural areas and land was provided to encourage families to move, to assist in [[food]] production for themselves, and to sell in local farmers' [[Market (place)|markets]]. As the film ''[[The Power of Community: How Cuba Survived Peak Oil]]'' discusses, [[cooperative|co-ops]] developed which were owned and managed by groups, as well as creating opportunities for allowing them to form "service co-ops" where credit was exchanged and group purchasing-power was used to buy [[seed]]s and other scarce items.&lt;ref name="poc_cuba"&gt;[http://www.powerofcommunity.org/cm/index.php ''[[The Power of Community: How Cuba Survived Peak Oil]]''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101016235947/http://www.powerofcommunity.org/cm/index.php |date=2010-10-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transportation===
&lt;gallery&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

Cubans were accustomed to [[car]]s as a convenient mode of [[transport]]. It was a difficult shift during the Special Period to adjust to a new way of managing the [[transport]] of thousands of people to [[school]], to [[employment|work]] and to other daily activities. With the realization that food was the key to [[wikt:survival|survival]], transport became a secondary worry and [[walking]], [[hitchhiking|hitch-hiking]], and carpooling became the norm. Privately owned [[vehicles]] are not common; ownership is not seen as a right but as a privilege awarded for performance. [[Public transport]] is creative and takes on the following forms:
* Cars – old US cars common in Cuba are used as [[Taxicab|taxis]] to transport from six to eight passengers, stopping at locations as needed.
* [[Truck]]s – canopies and steps were added to accommodate more passengers and protect them from the natural elements; or open "dump-truck buses" are used.
* [[bicycle|Bikes]] – 1.2 million bicycles were purchased from [[China]] and distributed as well as another half a million produced in Cuba.
* "Camels" – Conversion of semi-truck flatbeds into bus-like vehicles that hold up to 300 passengers.
* Government vehicles pick up passengers as needed.
* [[Horse]]s and [[mule]]s are used as well as bike- and horse-drawn carriages with taxi licenses are numerous both in rural and [[urban areas]].
* Convenience for the individual is secondary to efficient use of energy.

===Agriculture===

[[History of Cuba#Conquest of Cuba|Cuba's history of colonization]] included [[deforestation]] and overuse of its agricultural land. Before the [[crisis]], [[Cuba]] used more [[pesticide]]s than the [[United States|U.S.]] Lack of fertiliser and agricultural machinery caused a shift towards organic farming and urban farming. Cuba still has food rationing for basic staples. Approximately 69% of these rationed basic staples (wheat, vegetable oils, rice, etc.) are imported.&lt;ref name="The Paradox of Cuban Agriculture"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://monthlyreview.org/2012/01/01/the-paradox-of-cuban-agriculture|title=The Paradox of Cuban Agriculture |work=[[Monthly Review]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, however, approximately 16% of food is imported from abroad.&lt;ref name="The Paradox of Cuban Agriculture"/&gt;
{{Quotation|The grip of the state on Cuban farming has been disastrous. State farms of various kinds hold 75% of Cuba's 6.7&amp;nbsp;m hectares of agricultural land. In 2007 some 45% of this was lying idle, much of it overrun by marabú, a tenacious weed. Cuba is the only country in Latin America where killing a cow is a crime (and eating beef a rare luxury). That has not stopped the cattle herd declining from 7&amp;nbsp;m in 1967 to 4&amp;nbsp;m in 2011.|[[The Economist]]&lt;ref&gt;cite web|url=http://www.economist.com/node/21550416|title=Edging Towards Capitalism&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Initially, this was a very difficult situation for Cubans to accept; many came home from studying abroad to find that there were no jobs in their fields. It was pure survival that motivated them to continue and contribute to survive through this crisis. The documentary, ''The Power of Community: How Cuba Survived Peak Oil'', states that today, farmers make more money than most other occupations.&lt;ref name="poc_cuba"/&gt;

Due to a poor economy, there were many crumbling buildings that could not be repaired. These were torn down and the empty lots lay idle for years until the food shortages forced Cuban citizens to make use of every piece of land. Initially, this was an ''ad-hoc'' process where ordinary Cubans took the initiative to grow their own food in any available piece of land. The government encouraged this practice and later assisted in promoting it. Urban gardens sprung up throughout the capital of Havana and other urban centers on roof-tops, patios, and unused parking lots in raised beds as well as "squatting" on empty lots. These efforts were furthered by Australian agriculturalists who came to the island in 1993 to teach [[permaculture]], a sustainable agricultural system, and to "train the trainers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://members.optusnet.com.au/~cohousing/cuba/an95rpp1.htm |title=AIDAB/NGO Cooperation Program, Food Gardener Education in Urban Havana, 1995, Final Report from the Field |last1=Tiller |first1=Adam |date=1995 |website=Australian Conservation Foundation, Cuba |accessdate=21 July 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090816231941/http://members.optusnet.com.au/~cohousing/cuba/an95rpp1.htm |archivedate=16 August 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://members.optusnet.com.au/~cohousing/cuba/gt_esp.htm |title=Información sobre la dirección del proyecto en Cuba: el Green Team. |last1=Tiller |first1=Adam |date=1996 |website=Foundation for Nature and Humanity's Permaculture Project |accessdate=30 June 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090816232016/http://members.optusnet.com.au/~cohousing/cuba/gt_esp.htm |archivedate=16 August 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://members.optusnet.com.au/~cohousing/cuba/havad02.htm |title=Job Advertisement, Permaculture Development Officer, Urban Permaculture Program Havana, Cuba |last1=Tiller |first1=Adam |date=1997 |website=Foundation for Nature and Humanity's Permaculture Project |accessdate=30 June 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090816232026/http://members.optusnet.com.au/~cohousing/cuba/havad02.htm |archivedate=16 August 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite podcast |last1=Fenderson |first1=Adam |last2=Morgan |first2=Pamela |date=14 September 2006 |title=Interview with Pamela Morgan |url=http://www.radio4all.net/index.php/program/21578 |accessdate=12 July 2014 |format=mp3 |time=3:09 |location=Melbourne, Australia |publisher=A-Infos Radio Project }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Cuban government then sent teams throughout the country to train others.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

==Other effects==
The ideological changes of the Special Period had effects on Cuban society and culture, beyond those on the country. A comprehensive review of these effects concerning ideology, art and popular culture can be found in [[Ariana Hernandez-Reguant]]'s ''Cuba in the Special Period''. As a result of increased travel and [[tourism in Cuba|tourism]], popular culture developed in new ways. [[Lisa Knauer]], in that volume, describes the circulation of [[rumba]] between New York and Havana, and their mutual influences. [[Antonio Eligio Tonel]] has described the contemporary art networks that shaped the Cuban art market, and [[Esther Whitfield]] the channels through which [[Cuban literature]] accessed the wider Spanish speaking world during that period. Elsewhere, [[Deborah Pacini]], [[Marc Perry]], [[Geoffrey Baker]] and [[Sujatha Fernandes]] extensively wrote about [[Cuban rap]] music as a result of these transnational exchanges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baker | first1 = Geoffrey | authorlink = Geoffrey Baker | year = | title = ¡Hip hop, Revolución! Nationalizing Rap in Cuba | url = | journal = Ethnomusicology | volume = 49 | issue = 3| page = 369 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, that is, not in the 1990s which is the period identified with the Special Period, [[reggaeton]] has replaced [[timba]] as the genre of choice among youth, taking on the explicitly sexual dance moves that originated with timba.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ariana Hernandez-Reguant|Hernandez-Reguant, Ariana]]. "A Macho Sound for Black Sex." in [[Kamari Clarke]] and [[Deborah Thomas]], ''Globalization and Race'', Duke University Press. [[Jan Fairley|Fairley, Jan]]. "'Como hacer el amor con ropa' (As making love with your clothes on): Dancing regeton and hip-hop in Cuba." In ''Reading Reggaeton'' (forthcoming, Duke University Press), 2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reggaeton-in-cuba.com/en/dance.htm|title=Reggaeton in Cuba}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whereas timba music was a Cuban genre that evolved out of traditional son and jazz, emphasizing blackness and sexuality through sensual dancing, with lyrics that reflected the socio-cultural situation of the period with humor [Hernandez-Reguant 2006], [[Cuban hip hop]] evolved as a socially conscious movement influenced heavily by its kin genre [[American hip-hop|in the United States]]. Thus it was not so much a product of the Special Period—as timba was—as one of globalization.[Fernandes 2004] The Revolution and the blockage of all imports from the US had made the dissemination of American music difficult during the sixties and seventies, as it was often "tainted as music of the enemy and began to disappear from the public view." But all of that changed in the 1990s, when American rappers flocked regularly to Cuba, tourists brought CDs, and North American stations, perfectly audible in Cuba, brought its sounds. Nonetheless, hip hop circulated through informal networks, thus creating a small underground scene of rap enthusiasts located mostly in Havana's Eastern neighborhoods that called the attention of foreign scholars and journalists. Eventually, rappers were offered a space within state cultural networks. The lack of resources to purchase the electronic equipment to produce beats and tracks gives Cuban rap a raw feel that paralleled that of "[[old school rap|old school]]" music in the US.&lt;ref&gt;Pacini-Hernandez, Deborah and [[Reebee Garofalo]]''. "The emergence of rap Cubano: An historical perspective." In ''Music, Space, and Place'', editors Whitely, Bennett, and Hawkins, 89–107. Burlington, Vermont: Ashgate, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Temperate Northern Pacific''' is a [[biogeography|biogeographic]] region of the Earth's seas, comprising the temperate waters of the northern [[Pacific Ocean]].

The Temperate Northern Pacific connects, via the [[Bering Sea]], to the [[Arctic marine realm]], which includes the polar waters of the [[Arctic Sea]]. To the south, it transitions to the tropical marine realms of the Pacific, including the [[Tropical Eastern Pacific]] along the Pacific coast of the Americas, the Eastern Indo-Pacific in the central Pacific Ocean, and the [[Central Indo-Pacific]] of the western Pacific basin. The [[Taiwan Strait]] forms the boundary between the Temperate Northern Pacific and the Central Indo-Pacific.

Characteristic fauna include the Pacific salmon and trout ''([[Oncorhynchus]]'' spp.), [[gray whale]] ''(Eschrichtius robustus)'', and [[North Pacific right whale]] ''(Eubalaena japonica).''

==Subdivisions==
The Temperate Northern Pacific is further subdivided into marine provinces, and the marine provinces divided into marine ecoregions:

===Cold Temperate Northwest Pacific===

*[[Sea of Okhotsk]]
*[[Kamchatka Shelf and Coast]]
*[[Oyashio Current]]
*[[Northern Honshu]]
*[[Sea of Japan]]
*[[Yellow Sea]]

===Warm Temperate Northwest Pacific===

[[File:Anvil shaped cumulus panorama edit crop.jpg|thumb|[[Cumulonimbus cloud]]s often form [[thunderstorm]]s.]]
'''Thunder''' is the sound caused by [[lightning]]. Depending on the distance from and nature of the lightning, it can range from a sharp, loud crack to a long, low rumble (brontide). The sudden increase in [[pressure]] and [[temperature]] from lightning produces rapid [[Thermal expansion|expansion of the air]] surrounding and within a bolt of lightning. In turn, this expansion of air creates a sonic shock wave, similar to a [[sonic boom]], often referred to as a "thunderclap" or "peal of thunder".

{{Listen|filename=Thunder.ogg|title=Thunder|description=A short sample of a ''crack of thunder'' during the sound of falling rain|format=[[Ogg]]}}

==Cause==
The cause of thunder has been the subject of centuries of speculation and scientific [[inquiry]]. The first recorded theory is attributed to the Greek philosopher [[Aristotle]] in the fourth century BC, and an early speculation was that it was caused by the collision of [[clouds]]. Subsequently, numerous other theories were proposed. By the mid-19th century, the accepted theory was that lightning produced a [[vacuum]].

In the 20th century a consensus evolved that thunder must begin with a [[shock wave]] in the air due to the sudden thermal expansion of the [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] in the lightning channel.&lt;ref name="UmanVladimir A. Rakov2007"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rakov|first1=Vladimir A. |last2=Uman|first2=Martin A.|authorlink2=|title=Lightning: Physics and Effects|year=2007|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|location=Cambridge, England|isbn=978-0-521-03541-5|page=378}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The temperature inside the lightning channel, measured by [[Spectroscopy|spectral analysis]], varies during its 50 [[Microsecond|μs]] existence, rising sharply from an initial temperature of about 20,000&amp;nbsp;[[Kelvin|K]] to about 30,000&amp;nbsp;K, then dropping away gradually to about 10,000&amp;nbsp;K. The average is about {{convert|20400|K|C F}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cooray|first=Vernon|title=The lightning flash|publisher=[[Institution of Electrical Engineers]]|location=London|year=2003|pages=163–164|isbn=978-0-85296-780-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; This heating causes a rapid outward expansion, impacting the surrounding cooler air at a speed faster than sound would otherwise travel. The resultant outward-moving pulse is a shock wave,&lt;ref name="britannica"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | url =http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/594339/thunder | title =Thunder | encyclopedia =Encyclopædia Britannica | accessdate =2008-09-12 | deadurl =no | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20080607020659/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/594339/thunder | archivedate =2008-06-07 | df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
similar in principle to the shock wave formed by an [[explosion]], or at the front of a [[supersonic]] [[aircraft]].

Experimental studies of simulated lightning have produced results largely consistent with this model, though there is continued debate about the precise physical mechanisms of the process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = MacGorman | first1 = Donald R. | last2 = Rust | first2 = W.

Inversion thunder results when lightning strikes between cloud and ground occur during a temperature inversion. In such an inversion, the air near the ground is cooler than the higher air. The sound energy is prevented from dispersing vertically as it would in a non-inversion and is thus concentrated in the near-ground layer. Inversions often occur when warm moist air passes above a cold front; the resulting thunder sound is significantly louder than it would be if heard at the same distance in a non-inversion condition.&lt;ref&gt;Dean A. Pollet and Micheal M.

[[File:Lightning 14.07.2009 20-42-33.JPG|thumb|Thunder is the sound produced by [[lightning]].]]

==Etymology==
The ''d'' in Modern English ''thunder'' (from earlier [[Old English]] ''þunor'') is [[epenthetic]], and is now found as well in Modern Dutch ''donder'' (cp [[Middle Dutch]] ''donre'', and [[Old Norse]] ''[[þorr]]'', [[Old Frisian]] ''þuner'', [[Old High German]] ''donar'' descended from [[Proto-Germanic]] *''þunraz''). In [[Latin]] the term was ''tonare'' "to thunder". The name of the Germanic god [[Thor]] comes from the [[Old Norse language|Old Norse]] word for thunder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Oxford English Dictionary|edition=2|year=1989|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford, England|chapter=thunder|title-link=Oxford English Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The shared [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] [[Proto-Indo-European root|root]] is [[wikt:Appendix:List of Proto-Indo-European roots#t|*''tón-r̥'']] or ''*{{PIE|tar-}}'', also found Gaulish ''[[Taranis]]'' and Hittite ''[[Tarhunt]]''.

==Distance calculation==
A flash of lightning, followed after some time by a rumble of thunder, illustrates the fact that [[sound]] travels significantly slower than [[light]]. Using this difference, one can estimate how far away the bolt of lightning is by timing the interval between seeing the flash and hearing thunder. The [[speed of sound]] in dry air is approximately 343&amp;nbsp;m/s or 1,127&amp;nbsp;ft/s or {{convert|768|mph|abbr=on}} at 20&amp;nbsp;°C (68&amp;nbsp;°F).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 72nd edition, special student edition |page=14.36|publisher=The Chemical Rubber Co. |year=1991 |location=Boca Raton |isbn=978-0-8493-0486-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This translates to approximately 3 seconds per kilometer (or 5 seconds per mile); saying "One-Mississippi... Two-Mississippi..." (or "One One-thousand... Two One-Thousand...)&lt;ref name="One One-Thousand"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.philtulga.com/thunder.html|title=Thunderstorm Stopwatch|last=Tulga|first=Phil|date=|website=Music Through the Curriculum|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a useful method of counting the seconds from the perception of a given lightning flash to the perception of its thunder (which can be used to gauge the proximity of lightning for the sake of safety).&lt;ref name="One-Mississippi"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://eo.ucar.edu/webweather/lightningact2.html|title=Web Weather for Kids|last=|first=|date=|website=Web Weather for Kids|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
  
The [[speed of light]] is high enough that it can be taken as [[Infinity|infinite]] in this calculation because of the relatively small distance involved. Therefore, the lightning is approximately one kilometer distant for every three seconds that elapse between the visible flash and the first sound of thunder (or one mile for every five seconds). In the same five seconds, the light could have traveled the Lunar distance four times. (In this calculation, the initial shock wave, which travels at a rate faster than the speed of sound, but only extends outward for the first {{convert|30|ft|m|0}}, is ignored.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lightningsafety.com/nlsi_info/thunder2.html|title=The Science of Thunder - National Lightning Safety Institute|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071015104133/http://lightningsafety.com/nlsi_info/thunder2.html|archivedate=2007-10-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thunder is seldom heard at distances over {{convert|20|km|mi|sp=us}}.&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt; A very bright flash of lightning and an almost simultaneous sharp "crack" of thunder, a ''thundercrack'', therefore indicates that the lightning strike was very near.

The '''tree of life''' ({{lang-he-n|עֵץ הַחַיִּים}}, &lt;small&gt;[[Modern Hebrew language|Standard]]&lt;/small&gt;: ''{{transl|he|[[Etz Chaim|Etz haChayim]]}}'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:https://israelstudycenter.com/the-power-of-hebrew/+%22tree+of+life%22%22Etz+haChayim%22%22%D7%A2%D6%B5%D7%A5+%D7%94%D6%B7%D7%97%D6%B7%D7%99%D6%BC%D6%B4%D7%99%D7%9D%22 |title=The Power of Hebrew |website=Israel Study Center |first=Eli |last=Lizorkin-Eyzenberg |date=July 7, 2016 |accessdate=March 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a term used in the [[Hebrew Bible]] that is a component of the [[world tree]] motif.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=world tree|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/648638/world-tree|encyclopedia=''[[Encyclopædia Britannica Online|''Encyclopædia Britannica'' Online]]'' |date=July 20, 1998 |accessdate=March 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Book of Genesis]], the tree of life is first described in {{bibleverse|Genesis|2:9|HE|chapter 2, verse 9}} as being "in the midst of the [[Garden of Eden]]" with the [[tree of the knowledge of good and evil]] ({{lang-he-n|עֵץ הַדַּעַת}}). After the [[fall of man]], "lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever",&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Genesis|3:22|KJV}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[cherubim]] are placed at the east end of the Garden to guard the way to the tree of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Genesis|3:24|KJV}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tree of life has become the subject of some debate as to whether or not the tree of the knowledge of good and evil is the same tree.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mettinger|2007|pp=5–11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Bible outside of Genesis, the term "tree of life" appears in [[Book of Proverbs|Proverbs]] ({{Bibleref2-nb|Prov|3:18; 11:30; 13:12; 15:4|NRSV}}) and [[Book of Revelation|Revelation]] ({{Bibleref2-nb|Rev|2:7; 22:2,14,19|NRSV}}). It also appears in [[2 Esdras]] ({{Bibleref2-nb|2Esd|2:12; 8:52|NRSV}}) and [[4 Maccabees]] ({{Bibleref2-nb|4Mac|18:16|NRSV}}), which are included among the [[Jewish apocrypha]].

== Number of trees ==
[[Karl Budde]], in his [[Historical-critical method|critical research]] of 1883, outlined that there was only one tree in the body of the [[Book of Genesis|Genesis narrative]] and it qualified in two ways: one as the tree in the middle of the Garden, and two as the [[Tree of the knowledge of good and evil|forbidden tree]]. [[Claus Westermann]] gave recognition to Budde's theory in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mettinger|2007|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ellen van Wolde]] noted in her 1994 survey that among [[Bible scholar]]s "the trees are almost always dealt with separately and not related to each other” and that “attention is almost exclusively directed to the tree of knowledge of good and evil, whereas the tree of life is paid hardly any attention."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mettinger|2007|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christianity===

The [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] has traditionally understood the tree of life in Genesis as a [[Typology (theology)|prefiguration]] of the [[Christian cross|Cross]], which humanity could not partake of until after the [[Incarnation (Christianity)|incarnation]], [[death and resurrection of Jesus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Roman |first=Dr. Alexander |author-link= |contribution= |year= |title=Tree of Life in the Garden of Eden |editor-last= |editor-first= |volume= |pages= |place= |publisher=Ukrainian Orthodoxy |id= |url=http://www.unicorne.org/orthodoxy/automne2004/treeoflife.htm |accessdate= |format=&amp;ndash; &lt;sup&gt;[https://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=author%3ARoman+intitle%3ATree+of+Life+in+the+Garden+of+Eden&amp;as_publication=&amp;as_ylo=&amp;as_yhi=&amp;btnG=Search Scholar search]&lt;/sup&gt; |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070227172919/http://www.unicorne.org/orthodoxy/automne2004/treeoflife.htm |archivedate=February 27, 2007 }}

In ''[[The City of God (book)|The City of God]]'' (xiii.20-21), [[Augustine of Hippo]] offers great allowance for "spiritual" interpretations of the events in the garden, so long as such allegories do not rob the narrative of its historical reality. Enlightenment theologians (culminating perhaps in Brunner and Niebuhr in the twentieth century) sought for figurative interpretations because they had already dismissed the historical possibility of the story.

Others sought very pragmatic understandings of the tree. In the ''[[Summa Theologica]]'' (Q97), [[Thomas Aquinas]] argued that the tree served to maintain Adam's biological processes for an extended earthly animal life. It did not provide immortality as such, for the tree, being finite, could not grant infinite life. Hence after a period of time, the man and woman would need to eat again from the tree or else be "transported to the spiritual life." The common fruit trees of the garden were given to offset the effects of "loss of moisture" (note the doctrine of the [[humors]] at work), while the tree of life was intended to offset the inefficiencies of the body. Following [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] in the ''[[City of God (book)|City of God]]'' (xiv.26), “man was furnished with food against hunger, with drink against thirst, and with the tree of life against the ravages of old age.”

[[John Calvin]] (''Commentary on Genesis'' 2:8), following a different thread in Augustine (''City of God'', xiii.20), understood the tree in sacramental language. Given that humanity cannot exist except within a covenantal relationship with God, and all covenants use symbols to give us "the attestation of his grace", he gives the tree, "not because it could confer on man that life with which he had been previously endued, but in order that it might be a symbol and memorial of the life which he had received from God." God often uses symbols - He doesn’t transfer his power into these outward signs, but "by them He stretches out His hand to us, because, without assistance, we cannot ascend to Him." Thus he intends man, as often as he eats the fruit, to remember the source of his life, and acknowledge that he lives not by his own power, but by God's kindness. Calvin denies (contra Aquinas and without mentioning his name) that the tree served as a biological defense against physical [[aging]]. This is the standing interpretation in modern Reformed theology as well.

===Judaism===
According to [[Jewish mythology]], in the [[Garden of Eden]] there is a tree of life or the "tree of souls"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9dRi8v-j7OMC&amp;lpg=PA153&amp;pg=PA153#v=snippet&amp;q=%22Tree%20of%20Souls%22&amp;f=false |title=Origins of the Kabbalah |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2014-05-01|isbn=0691020477 |year=1990 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that blossoms and produces new [[souls]], which fall into the [[Guf]], the ''Treasury of Souls''. The Angel [[Gabriel]] reaches into the treasury and takes out the first soul that comes into his hand. Then [[Lailah]], the Angel of Conception, watches over the embryo until it is born.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/95135842/224/THE-TREASURY-OF-SOULS |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121030044612/http://www.scribd.com/doc/95135842/224/THE-TREASURY-OF-SOULS |archivedate=2012-10-30 |title=200_ THE TREASURY OF SOULS for Tree of Souls: The Mythology of Judaism |work=Scribd. |deadurl=yes |accessdate=15 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Soil Temperature Regimes (STR) ==
[[File:Global Distribution of Soil Temperature Regimes.jpg|thumb|Global Distribution of Soil Temperature Regimes]]
Soil temperature regimes, such as frigid, mesic, and thermic, are used to classify soils at some of the lower levels of the Soil Taxonomy. The cryic temperature regime distinguishes some higher-level groups. These regimes are based on the mean annual soil temperature (MAST), mean summer temperature, and the difference between mean summer and winter temperatures all at a soil depth of 50&amp;nbsp;cm. It is normally assumed that the MAST (in °C) equals the sum of the mean annual air temperature plus 2°C. If the difference between mean summer and winter temperatures is less than 6°C, then add "Iso" at the front of the name of the Soil Temperature Class.

[[File:Global Distribution of Soil Moisture Regimes.jpg|thumb|200px|upright|Map of Global Distribution of Soil Moisture Regimes]]

The soil moisture regime, often reflective of climatic factors, is a major determinant of the productivity of terrestrial ecosystems, including agricultural systems. The soil moisture regimes are defined based on the levels of the groundwater table and the amounts of soil water available to plants during a given year in a particular region. Several moisture regime classes are used to characterize soils.

|-
! scope="col" style="width:100px;" rowspan="1.5"| Soil Moisture Regime
! scope="col" style="width:850px;" colspan="1.5"| Major Characteristics
|-
| Aquic || Soil is saturated with water and virtually free of gaseous oxygen for sufficient periods of time, such that there is evidence of poor aeration (gleying and mottling); Common in wetlands
|-
| [[Udic moisture regime|Udic]] || Soil moisture is sufficiently high year-round in most years to meet plant requirement; Common in humid regions
|-
| [[Ustic]] || Soil moisture is intermediate between Udic and Aridic regimes; generally, plant-available moisture during the growing season, but severe periods of drought may occur; Common in semi-arid regions
|-
| Aridic || Soil is dry for at least half of the growing season and moist for less than 90 consecutive days; Common in arid (desert-like) regions
|-
| Xeric || Soil moisture regime is found in Mediterranean-type climates, with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. Like the Ustic Regime, it is characterized as having long periods of drought in the summer

&lt;div style="clear: right; float: right; margin: 0em 0em 1em 1em;"&gt;{{Xiazhi}}&lt;/div&gt;
The traditional East Asian calendars divide a year into 24 [[solar term]]s. '''''Xiàzhì''''', ''Geshi'', ''Haji'', or ''Hạ chí'' is the 10th solar term, and marks the [[summer solstice]]. It begins when the Sun reaches the [[celestial longitude]] of 90° and ends when it reaches the longitude of 105°. It more often refers in particular to the day when the Sun is exactly at the celestial longitude of 90°.

==Western correlation==
In the [[Gregorian calendar]], it usually begins around 21 June and ends around 7 July.

==The solstices==
The solstices (as well as the [[equinox]]es) mark the middle of the seasons in traditional East Asian calendars. Here, the Chinese character [[wikt:至|至]] means "extreme", which implies "solstices", so the term for the summer solstice directly signifies the summit of summer.
