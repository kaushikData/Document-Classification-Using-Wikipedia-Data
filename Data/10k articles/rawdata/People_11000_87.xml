The 14th Dalai Lama was born in [[Taktser]], [[Amdo]], [[Tibet]],  and was selected as the [[tulku]] of the [[13th Dalai Lama]] in 1937 and formally recognized as the 14th Dalai Lama at a public declaration near the town of Bumchen in 1939.&lt;ref name="dlce"&gt;{{cite web |title = Chronology of Events |url = http://www.dalailama.com/biography/chronology-of-events|website=The 14th Dalai Lama of Tibet |publisher = Office of the Dalai Lama |accessdate = 29 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; His enthronement ceremony as the Dalai Lama was held in Lhasa on 22 February 1940, and he eventually assumed full temporal (political) duties on 17 November 1950, at the age of 15, after [[Battle of Chamdo|the People's Republic of China's incorporation of Tibet]].&lt;ref name="dlce" /&gt; The Gelug school's government administered an area roughly corresponding to the [[Tibet Autonomous Region]] just as the nascent PRC wished to assert control over it.

The eldest was his sister Tsering Dolma, eighteen years his senior. His eldest brother, [[Thupten Jigme Norbu]], had been recognised at the age of eight as the reincarnation of the high [[Lama]] [[Taktser Rinpoche]]. His sister, [[Jetsun Pema (activist)|Jetsun Pema]], spent most of her adult life on the [[Tibetan Children's Villages]] project. The Dalai Lama has said that his first language was "a broken [[Xining]] language which was (a [[varieties of Chinese|dialect of]]) the [[Chinese language]]", a form of [[Central Plains Mandarin]], and his family did not speak the [[Amdo Tibetan language|Tibetan language]].&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Laird, [https://books.google.com/books?id=NH5vuMA7LYcC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=snippet&amp;q=%22broken%20Chinese%20regional%20dialect%22&amp;f=false ''The Story of Tibet: Conversations With the Dalai Lama''], p. 262 (2007) "At that time in my village", he said, "we spoke a broken Chinese.

The Dalai Lama and his family didn't learn Tibetan until they moved to Lhasa in 1939."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dalai Lama boy.jpg|thumb|left|The Dalai Lama as a boy]]

Following reported signs and visions, three search teams were sent out to the north-east, the east, and the south-east to locate the new [[incarnation]] when the boy who was to become the 14th Dalai Lama was about two years old.&lt;ref name=bell397&gt;Bell 1946, p. 397.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sir Basil Gould]], British delegate to Lhasa in 1936, related his account of the north-eastern team to Sir [[Charles Alfred Bell]], former British resident in Lhasa and friend of the 13th Dalai Lama. Amongst other omens, the head of the embalmed body of the [[thirteenth Dalai Lama]], at first facing south-east, had turned to face the north-east, indicating, it was interpreted, the direction in which his successor would be found. The [[Regent]], [[Jamphel Yeshe Gyaltsen|Reting Rinpoche]], shortly afterwards had a [[vision (religion)|vision]] at the sacred lake of [[Lhamo La-tso]] which he interpreted as Amdo being the region to search. This vision was also interpreted to refer to a large monastery with a gilded roof and turquoise tiles, and a twisting path from it to a hill to the east, opposite which stood a small house with distinctive eaves. The team, led by Kewtsang [[Rinpoche]], went first to meet the [[Thubten Choekyi Nyima, 9th Panchen Lama|Panchen Lama]], who had been stuck in [[Jyekundo]], in northern Kham.&lt;ref name=bell397 /&gt; The Panchen Lama had been investigating births of unusual children in the area ever since the death of the 13th Dalai Lama.&lt;ref name="Laird 2006, p. 265"&gt;Laird 2006, p. 265.&lt;/ref&gt; He gave Kewtsang the names of three boys whom he had discovered and identified as candidates. Within a year the Panchen Lama had died. Two of his three candidates were crossed off the list but the third, a "fearless" child, the most promising, was from Taktser village, which, as in the vision, was on a hill, at the end of a trail leading to Taktser from the great [[Kumbum Monastery]] with its gilded, turquoise roof. There they found a house, as interpreted from the vision—the house where Lhamo Dhondup lived.&lt;ref name=bell397 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Laird 2006, p. 265" /&gt;

According to the 14th Dalai Lama, at the time the village of [[Taktser]] stood right on the "real border" between the region of [[Amdo]] and China.&lt;ref&gt;Laird 2006, pp. 262–263.&lt;/ref&gt; When the team visited, posing as pilgrims, its leader, a Sera Lama, pretended to be the servant and sat separately in the kitchen. He held an old [[Buddhist prayer beads|rosary]] that had belonged to the 13th Dalai Lama, and the boy Lhamo Dhondup, aged two, approached and asked for it. The monk said "if you know who I am, you can have it." The child said "Sera Lama, Sera Lama" and spoke with him in a Lhasa accent, in a dialect the boy's mother could not understand. The next time the party returned to the house, they revealed their real purpose and asked permission to subject the boy to certain tests. One test consisted of showing him various pairs of objects, one of which had belonged to the [[13th Dalai Lama]] and one which had not. In every case, he chose the Dalai Lama's own objects and rejected the others.&lt;ref&gt;Laird 2006, pp. 265–266.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, it was the Panchen Lama who first discovered and identified the 14th Dalai Lama.

From 1936 the Hui '[[Ma Clique]]' Muslim warlord [[Ma Bufang]] ruled [[Qinghai]] as its governor under the nominal authority of the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]] central government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=drGGEsi1fFEC&amp;pg=PA36&amp;dq=ma+bufang+paintings&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=3I_lTbDEK8LOgAfQ67nGBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CEgQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=ma%20bufang%20paintings&amp;f=false|title=Beyond the Great Wall: urban form and transformation on the Chinese frontiers|author=Piper Rae Gaubatz|year=1996|publisher=[[Stanford University Press]]|location=|page=36|isbn=0-8047-2399-0|accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to an interview with the 14th Dalai Lama, in the 1930s, Ma Bufang had seized this north-east corner of Amdo in the name of [[Chiang Kai-shek]]'s weak government and incorporated it into the Chinese province of [[Qinghai]].&lt;ref&gt;Laird 2006, p. 262.&lt;/ref&gt; Before going to Taktser, Kewtsang had gone to Ma Bufang to pay his respects.&lt;ref name="Laird 2006, p. 265" /&gt; When Ma Bufang heard a candidate had been found in Taktser, he had the family brought to him in Xining.&lt;ref&gt;Mullin 2001, p. 459.&lt;/ref&gt; He first demanded proof that the boy was the Dalai Lama, but the Lhasa government, though informed by Kewtsang that this was the one, told Kewtsang to say he had to go to Lhasa for further tests with other candidates. They knew that if he was declared to be the Dalai Lama, the Chinese government would insist on sending a large army escort with him, which would then stay in Lhasa and refuse to budge.&lt;ref name=bell398&gt;Bell 1946, p. 398.&lt;/ref&gt; Ma Bufang, together with Kumbum Monastery, then refused to allow him to depart unless he was declared to be the Dalai Lama, but withdrew this demand in return for 100,000 Chinese dollars ransom in silver to be shared amongst them, to let them go to Lhasa.&lt;ref name=bell398 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richardson 1984, p. 152.&lt;/ref&gt; Kewtsang managed to raise this, but the family was only allowed to move from Xining to Kumbum when a further demand was made for another 330,000 dollars ransom: one hundred thousand each for government officials, the commander-in-chief, and the Kumbum Monastery; twenty thousand for the escort; and only ten thousand for Ma Bufang himself, he said.&lt;ref&gt;Bell 1946, pp. 398–399.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two years of diplomatic wrangling followed before it was accepted by Lhasa that the ransom had to be paid to avoid the Chinese getting involved and escorting him to Lhasa with a large army.&lt;ref&gt;Richardson 1984, pp. 152–153.&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, the boy was kept at Kumbum where two of his brothers were already studying as monks and recognised incarnate lamas.&lt;ref name=laird267&gt;Laird 2006, p. 267.&lt;/ref&gt; The payment of 300,000 silver dollars was then advanced by Muslim traders en route to Mecca in a large caravan via Lhasa. They paid Ma Bufang on behalf of the Tibetan government against promissory notes to be redeemed, with interest, in Lhasa.&lt;ref name=laird267 /&gt;&lt;ref name=rich153&gt;Richardson 1984, p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt; The 20,000-dollar fee for an escort was dropped, since the Muslim merchants invited them to join their caravan for protection; Ma Bufang sent 20 of his soldiers with them and was paid from both sides since the Chinese government granted him another 50,000 dollars for the expenses of the journey. Furthermore, the Indian government helped the Tibetans raise the ransom funds by affording them import concessions.&lt;ref name=rich153 /&gt;

Released from Kumbum, on 21 July 1939 the party travelled across Tibet in an epic journey to Lhasa in the large Muslim caravan with Lhamo Thondup, now 4 years old, riding with his brother Lobsang in a special palanquin carried by two mules, two years after being discovered. As soon as they were out of Ma Bufang's area, he was officially declared to be the 14th Dalai Lama by the Central Government of Tibet, and after ten weeks of travel he arrived in Lhasa on 8 October 1939.&lt;ref&gt;Laird 2006, pp. 268–269.&lt;/ref&gt; The ordination ([[pabbajja]]) and giving of the monastic name of Tenzin Gyatso were handled by [[Reting Rinpoche]]. There was very limited Chinese involvement at this time.&lt;ref name="Banyan"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/news/china/21646795-even-china-accepts-only-dalai-lama-can-legitimise-its-rule-tibet-golden-urn|title=The Golden Urn: Even China Accepts That Only the Dalai Lama Can Legitimise Its Rule in Tibet|last=Banyan|website=The Economist|date=19 March 2015|accessdate=29 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan Buddhists]] normally refer to him as Yishin Norbu (''Wish-Fulfilling Gem''), Kyabgon (''Saviour''), or just Kundun (''Presence''). His devotees, as well as much of the Western world, often call him ''His Holiness the Dalai Lama'', the [[style (manner of address)|style]] employed on the Dalai Lama's website. According to the Dalai Lama, he had a succession of tutors in Tibet including [[Jamphel Yeshe Gyaltsen|Reting Rinpoche]], Tathag Rinpoche, [[Ling Rinpoche]] and lastly [[Trijang Rinpoche]], who became junior tutor when he was nineteen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lama|first1=Dalai |title = Freedom in Exile: The Autobiography of the Dalai Lama. |date = 1990 |publisher = HarperCollins|location=New York, NY |ISBN = 0-06-039116-2 |page = 18|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the age of 11 he met the [[Austrians|Austrian]] mountaineer [[Heinrich Harrer]], who became his [[videographer]] and tutor about the world outside [[Lhasa]].

In 1959, at the age of 23, he took his final examination at [[Lhasa]]'s [[Jokhang]] Temple during the annual [[Monlam]] or Prayer Festival.

Historically the Dalai Lamas or their [[regent]]s held political and religious leadership over [[Tibet]] from [[Lhasa]] with varying degrees of influence depending on the regions of Tibet and periods of history. This began with the [[5th Dalai Lama]]'s rule in 1642 and lasted until the 1950s (except for 1705–1750), during which period the Dalai Lamas headed the Tibetan government or [[Ganden Phodrang]]. Until 1912 however, when the [[13th Dalai Lama]] declared the complete independence of [[Tibet (1912–1951)|Tibet]], their rule was generally subject to [[priest and patron|patronage and protection]] of firstly Mongol kings (1642–1720) and then the [[Manchu people|Manchu]]-led [[Qing dynasty]] (1720–1912).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Smith, Warren W. Jr.|title=Tibetan Nation: A History of Tibetan Nationalism and Sino-Tibetan Relations|date=1997|publisher=HarperCollins|location=New Delhi|isbn=0-8133-3155-2|pages=107–149}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1939, at the age of four, the present Dalai Lama was taken in a procession of lamas to Lhasa. The Dalai Lama's childhood was then spent between the [[Potala Palace]] and [[Norbulingka]], his summer residence, both of which are now [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage sites]].

China claims that the [[Kuomintang]] government ratified the 14th Dalai Lama and that a Kuomintang representative, General [[Wu Zhongxin]], presided over the ceremony. The British Representative [[Basil Gould|Sir Basil Gould]] was also at the ceremony and bore witness to the falsity of the Chinese claim to have presided over it. He criticised the Chinese account as follows: 
{{quote|The report was issued in the Chinese Press that Mr Wu had escorted the Dalai Lama to his throne and announced his installation, that the Dalai Lama had returned thanks, and prostrated himself in token of his gratitude. Every one of these Chinese claims was false. Mr Wu was merely a passive spectator. He did no more than present a ceremonial scarf, as was done by the others, including the British Representative. But the Chinese have the ear of the world, and can later refer to their press records and present an account of historical events that is wholly untrue. Tibet has no newspapers, either in English or Tibetan, and has therefore no means of exposing these falsehoods.&lt;ref&gt;Bell 1946, p. 400.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Tibetan scholar Nyima Gyaincain wrote that based on Tibetan tradition, there was no such thing as presiding over an event, but two things are clear, first, the word "主持 (preside or organize)" was used in many places in communication documents. The meaning of the word was different than what we understand today. Second, [[Wu Zhongxin]] spent a lot of time and energy on the event, his effect of presiding over or organizing the event was very obvious.&lt;ref name="王家伟尼玛坚赞1997_preside"&gt;{{cite book|author1=王家伟|author2=尼玛坚赞|title=中国西藏的历史地位|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eWCa0NSILSsC&amp;pg=PA133|year=1997|publisher=五洲传播出版社|isbn=978-7-80113-303-8|pages=133–}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to Goldstein:

In October 1950 the army of the [[People's Republic of China]] marched to the edge of the Dalai Lama's territory and sent a delegation after defeating a legion of the Tibetan army in [[warlord]]-controlled [[Kham]]. On 17 November 1950, at the age of 15, the 14th Dalai Lama was enthroned formally as the temporal ruler of Tibet.

=== Cooperation and conflicts with the People's Republic of China ===

Panchen Lama and Dalai Lama had many conflicts in Tibetan history. Dalai Lama's formal rule was brief. He sent a delegation to Beijing, which, without his authorization,&lt;ref name="bio" /&gt; ratified the [[Seventeen Point Agreement for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet]].&lt;ref&gt;Gyatso, Tenzin, Dalai Lama XIV, interview, 25 July 1981.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein, Melvyn C., ''A History of Modern Tibet, 1913–1951'', University of California Press, 1989, pp. 812–813.&lt;/ref&gt; He worked with the Chinese government: in September 1954, together with the [[10th Panchen Lama]] he went to the Chinese capital to meet [[Mao Zedong]] and attend the first session of the [[National People's Congress]] as a delegate, primarily discussing [[Constitution of the People's Republic of China|China's constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein, M.C., ''A History of Modern Tibet, Volume 2 – The Calm before the Storm: 1951–1955'', p. 493.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2005-08/30/content_3422747.htm Ngapoi recalls the founding of the TAR]'', [[Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme]], ''[[China View]]'', 30 August 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; On 27 September 1954, the Dalai Lama was selected as a [[Vice Chairperson of the National People's Congress|Vice chairman]] of the [[Standing Committee of the National People's Congress|Standing Committee]] of the [[National People's Congress]],&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein, M.C., ''A History of Modern Tibet, Volume 2 – The Calm before the Storm: 1951–1955'', p. 496.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://voyage.typepad.com/china/2007/01/chairman_mao_lo.html |title=Chairman Mao: Long Live Dalai Lama! |publisher=Voyage.typepad.com |date=21 January 2007 |accessdate=2 May 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100505143746/http://voyage.typepad.com/china/2007/01/chairman_mao_lo.html |archivedate=5 May 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; a post he officially held until 1964.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url = http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/90001/90776/90883/6284184.html |title = Official: Dalai Lama's U.S. award not to affect Tibet's stability |date = 2007-10-16 |accessdate = 28 August 2010 |publisher = [[People's Daily]]|work=[[17th National Congress of the Communist Party of China]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1956, on a trip to India to celebrate the [[Buddha's Birthday]], the Dalai Lama asked the [[Prime Minister of India]], [[Jawaharlal Nehru]], if he would allow him [[political asylum]] should he choose to stay. Nehru discouraged this as a provocation against peace, and reminded him of the Indian Government's [[Non-interventionism|non-interventionist]] stance agreed upon with its [[Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence|1954 treaty with China]].&lt;ref name="bio" /&gt;

=== Exile to India ===

[[File:IMG 1206 Lhasa Potala.jpg|thumb|left|Abandoned former quarters of the Dalai Lama at the Potala. The empty vestment placed on the throne symbolises his absence]]

At the outset of the [[1959 Tibetan uprising]], fearing for his life, the Dalai Lama and his retinue fled Tibet with the help of the CIA's [[Special Activities Division]],&lt;ref&gt;The CIA's Secret War in Tibet, Kenneth Conboy, James Morrison, The University Press of Kansas, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; crossing into India on 30 March 1959, reaching [[Tezpur]] in [[Assam]] on 18 April.&lt;ref&gt;Richardson (1984), p. 210.&lt;/ref&gt; Some time later he set up the [[Government of Tibet in Exile]] in [[Dharamshala, Himachal Pradesh|Dharamshala]], India,&lt;ref&gt;"Witness: Reporting on the Dalai Lama's escape to India."

After the founding of the government in exile he re-established the approximately 80,000 Tibetan refugees who followed him into exile in agricultural settlements.&lt;ref name="bbcprofile" /&gt; He created a Tibetan educational system in order to teach the Tibetan children the [[Tibetic languages|language]], [[History of Tibet|history]], [[Tibetan Buddhism|religion]], and [[Tibet#Culture|culture]]. The [[Tibetan Institute of Performing Arts]] was established&lt;ref name="bbcprofile" /&gt; in 1959 and the [[Central Institute of Higher Tibetan Studies]]&lt;ref name="bbcprofile" /&gt; became the primary university for Tibetans in India in 1967. He supported the refounding of 200 monasteries and nunneries in an attempt to preserve Tibetan Buddhist teachings and the Tibetan way of life.

The Dalai Lama appealed to the [[United Nations]] on the rights of Tibetans. This appeal resulted in three resolutions adopted by the [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly]] in 1959, 1961, and 1965,&lt;ref name="bbcprofile" /&gt; all before the People's Republic [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 2758|was allowed representation at the United Nations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.upi.com/Audio/Year_in_Review/Events-of-1971/12295509436546-1/ |title=Events of 1971 |work=Year in Review |year=1971 |publisher=United Press International |accessdate=28 August 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5gYCuqxqS?url=http://www.upi.com/Audio/Year_in_Review/Events-of-1971/12295509436546-1/ |archivedate=5 May 2009 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The resolutions called on China to respect the human rights of [[Tibetan people|Tibetans]].&lt;ref name="bbcprofile" /&gt; In 1963, he promulgated a democratic constitution which is based upon the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], creating an elected [[Parliament of the Central Tibetan Administration|parliament]] and an [[Central Tibetan Administration|administration]] to champion his cause. In 1970, he opened the [[Library of Tibetan Works and Archives]] in Dharamshala which houses over 80,000 manuscripts and important knowledge resources related to Tibetan history, politics and culture. It is considered one of the most important institutions for [[Tibetology]] in the world.&lt;ref name="LTWA"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.tibet.com/ltwa.html |title = Library of Tibetan Works and Archives|year=1997 |publisher = [[Government of Tibet in Exile]] |accessdate = 23 September 2008 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080421150024/http://www.tibet.com/ltwa.html |archivedate=21 April 2008 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, there were demands from Indian politicians of different political parties and citizens to confer His Holiness The Dalai Lama the prestigious [[Bharat Ratna]], the highest civilian honour of India which has only been awarded to a Non-Indian citizen twice in its history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Bharat-Ratna-demanded-for-Dalai-Lama/articleshow/55877372.cms|title=Bharat Ratna demanded for Dalai Lama – Times of India|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== International advocacy ===

At the [[Congressional Human Rights Caucus]] in 1987 in [[Washington, D.C.]], the Dalai Lama gave a speech outlining his ideas for the future status of Tibet. The plan called for Tibet to become a democratic "zone of peace" without [[nuclear weapons]], and with support for [[human rights]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} The plan would come to be known as the "Strasbourg proposal", because the Dalai Lama expanded on the plan at [[Strasbourg]] on 15 June 1988. There, he proposed the creation of a self-governing Tibet "in association with the People's Republic of China." This would have been pursued by negotiations with the PRC government, but the plan was rejected by the Tibetan Government-in-Exile in 1991. {{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} The Dalai Lama has indicated that he wishes to return to Tibet only if the People's Republic of China agrees not to make any precondition for his return.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/sep/05/china.lukeharding Interview] with ''[[The Guardian]]'', 5 September 2003&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1970s, the then-[[Paramount leader]] [[Deng Xiaoping]] set China's sole return requirement to the Dalai Lama as that he "must [come back] as a Chinese citizen  ... that is, patriotism".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url = http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2009-03/01/content_10921943_3.htm |title = Origin of the title of "Dalai Lama" and its related background |date = 2009-03-01 |accessdate = 28 August 2010 |first=Jiang|last=Yuxia |publisher = [[Xinhua]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dalai Lama celebrated his seventieth birthday on 6 July 2005. About 10,000 Tibetan refugees, monks and foreign tourists gathered outside his home. [[Patriarch Alexius II]] of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] alleged positive relations with Buddhists. However, later that year, the Russian state prevented the Dalai Lama from fulfilling an invitation to the traditionally Buddhist republic of [[Kalmykia]].&lt;ref&gt;Fagan, Geraldine.

The Dalai Lama is an advocate for a world free of nuclear weapons, and currently serves on the Advisory Council of the [[Nuclear Age Peace Foundation]].

The Dalai Lama has voiced his support for the [[Campaign for the Establishment of a United Nations Parliamentary Assembly]], an organisation which campaigns for democratic reformation of the United Nations, and the creation of a more accountable international political system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://en.unpacampaign.org/supporters/overview/?mapcountry=allnob&amp;mapgroup=nob|title=Overview|date=|work=Campaign for a UN Parliamentary Assembly|access-date=2017-09-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;

Giving [[public talks]] for non-Buddhist audiences and interviews and teaching Buddhism to large public audiences all over the world, as well as to private groups at his residence in India, appears to be the Dalai Lama's main activity.&lt;ref name="Schedule"&gt;{{cite web |title = Schedule |url = http://www.dalailama.com/teachings/schedule |publisher = Office of the Dalai Lama |accessdate = 19 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite becoming 80 years old in 2015 he maintains a busy international lectures and teaching schedule.&lt;ref name="Schedule" /&gt; His [[public talks]] and [[teachings]] are usually [[webcast]] live in multiple languages, via an inviting organisation's [[website]], or on the Dalai Lama's own website.

In Dalai Lama's essay, "The Ethic of Compassion" (1999), he expresses his belief that if we only reserve compassion for those that we love, we are ignoring the responsibility of sharing these characteristics of respect and empathy with those we do not have relationships with, which cannot allow us to "cultivate love." He elaborates upon this idea by writing that although it takes time to develop a higher level of compassion, eventually we will recognize that the quality of empathy will become a part of life and promote our quality as humans and inner strength.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dalai Lama XIV|title="The Ethic of Compassion."|date=1999|publisher=Riverhead Books|pages=123–31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As examples of other teachings, in London in 1984 he was invited to give teachings on the Twelve Links of Dependent Arising, and on [[Dzogchen]], which he gave at Camden Town Hall; in 1988 he was in London once more to give a series of lectures on Tibetan Buddhism in general, called 'A Survey of the Paths of Tibetan Buddhism'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = A Survey of the Paths of Tibetan Buddhism |url = http://www.lamayeshe.com/index.php?sect=article&amp;id=421 |publisher = Lama Yeshe Wisdom Archive |accessdate = 18 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Again in London in 1996 he taught the [[Four Noble Truths]], the basis and foundation of Buddhism accepted by all Buddhists, at the combined invitation of 27 different Buddhist organisations of all schools and traditions belonging to the Network of Buddhist Organisations UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Tseten Samdup |title = His Holiness the Dalai Lama will visit the UK from July 15–22 1996 |url = http://www.tibet.ca/en/library/wtn/archive/old?y=1996&amp;m=7&amp;p=7_2 |publisher = World Tibet Network News |date = 7 July 1996 |quote = For the first time in the West, His Holiness the Dalai Lama will give two exclusive days of teaching on 17 and 18 July 1996 on the Four Noble Truths – the heart of the Buddha's teachings.

=== Interfaith dialogue ===

The Dalai Lama met [[Pope Paul VI]] at the [[Vatican City|Vatican]] in 1973. He met [[Pope John Paul II]] in 1980, 1982, 1986, 1988, 1990, and 2003. In 1990, he met a delegation of Jewish teachers in Dharamshala for an extensive interfaith dialogue.&lt;ref&gt;Kamenetz, Rodger (1994)[https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060645741 The Jew in the Lotus] Harper Collins: 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; He has since visited Israel three times, and in 2006 met the Chief Rabbi of Israel. In 2006, he met [[Pope Benedict XVI]] privately. He has met the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], Dr. [[Robert Runcie]], and other leaders of the Anglican Church in London, [[Gordon B. Hinckley]], who at the time was the president of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (Mormons), as well as senior [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], [[Muslim]], [[Hindu]], [[Jewish]], and [[Sikh]] officials.
The Dalai Lama is also currently a member of the Board of World Religious Leaders as part of [[The Elijah Interfaith Institute]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.elijah-interfaith.org/?id=729 |title = The Elijah Interfaith Institute – Buddhist Members of the Board of World Religious Leaders |publisher = Elijah-interfaith.org |date = 2006-12-24 |accessdate = 17 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and participated in the Third Meeting of the Board of World Religious Leaders in [[Amritsar]], India, on 26 November 2007 to discuss the topic of Love and Forgiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elijah-interfaith.org/programs/board-of-world-religious-leaders/third-meeting-of-the-bwrl.html |title=Third Meeting of the Board of World Religious Leaders |publisher=Elijah-interfaith.org |date=2013-04-07 |accessdate=17 July 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131227160915/https://www.elijah-interfaith.org/programs/board-of-world-religious-leaders/third-meeting-of-the-bwrl.html |archivedate=27 December 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 January 2009, the Dalai Lama inaugurated an [[interfaith]] "World Religions-Dialogue and Symphony" conference at [[Gujarat]]'s [[Mahuva (Bhavnagar district)|Mahuva]] religions", according to [[Morari Bapu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.indianexpress.com/news/dalai-Lama-inaugurates-6day-world-religions-.../407503 |title = Dalai Lama inaugurates 6-day world religions meet at Mahua |publisher = Indianexpress.com |date = 7 January 2009 |accessdate = 2 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author = Canada Tibet Committee |url = http://www.tibet.ca/en/newsroom/wtn/5137 |title = Dalai Lama to inaugurate inter-faith conference |publisher = Tibet.ca |accessdate = 2 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 May 2010 the Dalai Lama, joined by a panel of select scholars, officially launched the [[Common Ground Project]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://islambuddhism.com/ |title = Islam and Buddhism |publisher = Islambuddhism.com |date = 2010-05-12 |accessdate = 17 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Bloomington, Indiana]] (USA),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://islambuddhism.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=22:dalai-lama-muslim-leaders-seek-peace-in-bloomington&amp;catid=6:in-the-news&amp;Itemid=4 |title = Dalai Lama, Muslim Leaders Seek Peace in Bloomington |publisher = Islambuddhism.com |date = 2010-05-31 |accessdate = 17 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was planned by himself and [[Prince Ghazi bin Muhammad]] of [[Jordan]] during several years of personal conversations.

His growing wish to develop meaningful scientific dialogue to explore the [[Buddhism and science]] interface led to invitations for him to attend relevant conferences on his visits to the west, including the [[Alpbach]] Symposia on Consciousness in 1983 where he met and had discussions with the late Chilean neuroscientist [[Francisco J.

Apart from time spent teaching Buddhism and fulfilling responsibilities to his Tibetan followers, the Dalai Lama has probably spent, and continues to spend, more of his time and resources investigating the interface between [[Buddhism and science]] through the ongoing series of [[Mind and Life Institute|Mind and Life]] dialogues and its spin-offs than on any other single activity.&lt;ref name=Grnd /&gt; As the Institute's Cofounder and the Honorary chairman he has personally presided over and participated in all its dialogues, which continue to expand worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Dialogues with the Dalai Lama |url = https://www.mindandlife.org/dialogues-dalai-lama/ |publisher = Mind and Life Institute |accessdate = 6 May 2015 |quote = These Dialogues will expand as Mind and Life grows to include Europe, Asia, and beyond}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These activities have given rise to dozens of DVD sets of the dialogues and books he has authored on them such as '''Ethics for the New Millennium''' and '''The Universe in a Single Atom''', as well as scientific papers and university research programmes.&lt;ref name=pdf&gt;{{cite web |title = A 25 Years History of Accomplishment |url = https://www.dropbox.com/sh/gns1ff0ziu9ikx3/AAAH3rqan1jP_RyksNVOYl0Da/MLI%2025%20years%20of%20Accomplishment.pdf?dl=0 |publisher = Mind and Life Institute |accessdate = 6 May 2015|format=PDF |date = 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the Tibetan and Buddhist side, science subjects have been added to the curriculum for Tibetan monastic educational institutions and scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Dalai Lama and Western Science |url=http://www.investigatingthemind.org/hhdl.science.html |publisher=Mind and Life Institute |accessdate=6 May 2015 |quote=he has led a campaign to introduce basic science education in Tibetan Buddhist monastic colleges and academic centers, and has encouraged Tibetan scholars to engage with science as a way of revitalizing the Tibetan philosophical tradition |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150219190156/http://investigatingthemind.org/hhdl.science.html |archivedate=19 February 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the Western side, university and research programmes initiated by these dialogues and funded with millions of dollars in grants from the Dalai Lama Trust include the Emory-Tibet Partnership,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Emory-Tibet Science Initiative receives $1&amp;nbsp;million grant from Dalai Lama Trust |url=https://tibet.emory.edu/news-and-media/news/2014/emory-tibet-science-initiative-receives-1-million-grant-from-dalai-lama-trust/index.html |publisher=Emory University |location=Georgia, USA |date=2014 |quote=For more than 30 years I have been engaged in an ongoing exchange with scientists, exploring what modern scientific knowledge and time-honored science of mind embodied by the Tibetan tradition can bring to each other's understanding of reality |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518083919/https://tibet.emory.edu/news-and-media/news/2014/emory-tibet-science-initiative-receives-1-million-grant-from-dalai-lama-trust/index.html |archivedate=18 May 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stanford School of Medicine]]'s Centre for Compassion and Altruism Research and Education (CCARES)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = His Holiness the XIVth Dalai Lama, Tenzin Gyatso Founding Patron, CCARE |url = http://ccare.stanford.edu/about/people/patron-committee/#150 |publisher = Stanford University School of Medicine |accessdate = 7 May 2015|location=Palo Alto, California |quote = He has been a strong supporter of the neurosciences for over two decades.

In particular, the Mind and Life Education Humanities &amp; Social Sciences initiatives have been instrumental in developing the emerging field of Contemplative Science, by researching, for example, the effects of contemplative practice on the human brain, behaviour and biology.&lt;ref name="pdf" /&gt;

In his 2005 book ''The Universe in a Single Atom'' and elsewhere, and to mark his commitment to scientific truth and its ultimate ascendancy over religious belief, unusually for a major religious leader the Dalai Lama advises his Buddhist followers: "If scientific analysis were conclusively to demonstrate certain claims in Buddhism to be false, then we must accept the findings of science and abandon those claims."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lama|first1=Dalai |title = The Universe in a Single Atom |date = 2005 |publisher = Random House|location=New York |ISBN =978-0-375-72845-7 |page = 3|edition=First Large Print}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has also cited examples of archaic Buddhist ideas he has abandoned himself on this basis.&lt;ref name="nyt" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=James Kingsland |title = Dalai Lama enlightens and enraptures contemplative scientists in Boston |url = https://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2014/nov/03/dalai-lama-scientists-boston-international-symposium-contemplative-studies |publisher = The Guardian|location=Boston, USA |date = 3 November 2014 |quote = He   ... had long since abandoned Buddhist ideas about cosmology after reading about the findings of modern astronomers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These activities have even had an impact in the Chinese capital. In 2013 an 'academic dialogue' with a Chinese scientist, a Tibetan 'living Buddha' and a Professor of Religion took place in Beijing. Entitled "High-end dialogue: ancient Buddhism and modern science" it addressed the same considerations that interest the Dalai Lama, described as 'discussing about the similarities between Buddhism and modern science'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Lethe Guo |title=High-end dialogue: ancient Buddhism and modern science |url=http://eng.tibet.cn/2010zj/zjhd/201312/t20131219_1960457.html |publisher=China Tibet Online |date=18 December 2013 |quote=crossover between Buddhism and science has become a hot topic in the academic and cultural circles over the recent decades |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151005160313/http://eng.tibet.cn/2010zj/zjhd/201312/t20131219_1960457.html |archivedate=5 October 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Abortion ===

The Dalai Lama has shown a nuanced position on [[abortion]]. He explained that, from the perspective of the Buddhist precepts, abortion is an act of killing.&lt;ref&gt;Gary Stivers [https://web.archive.org/web/20081025010504/http://www.sunvalleyonline.com/news/article.asp?ID_Article=1146 Dalai Lama meets Idaho’s religious leaders], sunvalleyonline.com, 15 September 2005&lt;/ref&gt; He has also clarified that in certain cases abortion could be considered ethically acceptable "if the unborn child will be retarded or if the birth will create serious problems for the parent", which could only be determined on a case-by-case basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=[[Claudia Dreifus]] |work=New York Times |date=28 November 1993 |url=http://www.tibet.ca/en/newsroom/wtn/archive/old?y=1993&amp;m=12&amp;p=5_1 |title=New York Times Interview with the Dalai Lama |accessdate=31 March 2009 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5gQKhCcto?url=http://www.tibet.ca/en/newsroom/wtn/archive/old?y=1993&amp;m=12&amp;p=5_1 |archivedate=30 April 2009 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Democracy, nonviolence, religious harmony, and Tibet's relationship with India ===

[[File:Vienna 2012-05-26 - Europe for Tibet Solidarity Rally 194 HH sequence s.jpg|thumb|Tenzin Gyatso in Vienna, Austria, in&amp;nbsp;2012]]

The Dalai Lama says that he is active in spreading India's message of [[nonviolence]] and religious harmony throughout the world. "I am the messenger of India's ancient thoughts the world over." He has said that democracy has deep roots in India. He says he considers India the master and Tibet its disciple, as great scholars went from India to Tibet to teach Buddhism. He has noted that millions of people lost their lives in violence and the economies of many countries were ruined due to conflicts in the 20th century. "Let the 21st century be a century of tolerance and dialogue."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indianexpress.com/news/im-messenger-of-indias-ancient-thoughts-dalai-lama/541448 I'm messenger of India's ancient thoughts: Dalai Lama], [https://archive.is/20120903155544/http://www.hindustantimes.com/rssfeed/arunachalpradesh/I-m-messenger-of-India-s-ancient-thoughts-the-Dalai-Lama/Article1-476436.aspx I'm messenger of India's ancient thoughts: The Dalai Lama – Hindustan Times], [http://content.usatoday.com/topics/quote/Religion+and+beliefs/Leaders,+Experts/Dalai+Lama/07vj4sKh2wbTR/06zWaNQ1qJ3u0/1 Dalai Lama Story Page – USATODAY.com] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121003140427/http://content.usatoday.com/topics/quote/Religion+and+beliefs/Leaders,+Experts/Dalai+Lama/07vj4sKh2wbTR/06zWaNQ1qJ3u0/1 |date=3 October 2012 }}, [http://tibet.ca/en/newsroom/wtn/7998 Canada Tibet Committee|Newsroom|WTN] "I'm messenger of India's ancient thoughts": Dalai Lama; 14 November 2009; Itanagar.

In 2001, he answered the question of a girl in a [[Seattle]] school by saying that it is permissible to shoot someone with a gun in self-defense if that person was "trying to kill you," and he emphasized that the shot should not be fatal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bernton|first=Hal |url = http://archives.seattletimes.nwsource.com/cgi-bin/texis.cgi/web/vortex/display?slug=dalai15m0&amp;date=20010515 |title = Dalai Lama urges students to shape the world |publisher = Archives.seattletimes.nwsource.com |date = 15 May 2001 |accessdate = 2 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2013, the Dalai Lama openly criticised Buddhist monks' [[2013 Burma anti-Muslim riots|attacks on Muslims]] in [[Myanmar]] "Buddha always teaches us about forgiveness, tolerance, compassion. If from one corner of your mind, some emotion makes you want to hit, or want to kill, then please remember Buddha's faith. We are followers of Buddha." He said that "All problems must be solved through dialogue, through talk.

In response to the death of [[China|Chinese]] [[2010 Nobel Peace Prize|Nobel Peace Prize]] laureate [[Liu Xiaobo]], who died of organ failure while in government custody, the Dalai Lama issued the following statement on 14 July 2017, "I am deeply saddened to learn that fellow Nobel Laureate Liu Xiaobo has passed away while undergoing a lengthy prison sentence  ... It is my belief that Nobel Laureate Liu Xiaobo's unceasing efforts in the cause of freedom will bear fruit before long."&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.dalailama.com/news/2017/message-from-his-holiness-the-dalai-lama His Holiness the Dalai Lama Deeply Saddened by Liu Xiaobo's Passing…"].

=== Diet and animal welfare ===
{{quote|People think of animals as if they were vegetables, and that is not right. We have to change the way people think about animals.

The Dalai Lama advocates compassion for animals and frequently urges people to try [[vegetarianism]] or at least reduce their consumption of meat. In Tibet, where historically meat was the most common food, most monks historically have been [[omnivore]]s, including the Dalai Lamas. The Fourteenth Dalai Lama was raised in a meat-eating family but converted to vegetarianism after arriving in India, where vegetables are much more easily available. He spent many years as a [[vegetarianism|vegetarian]], but after contracting [[hepatitis]] in India and suffering from weakness, his doctors ordered him to eat meat on alternating days, which he did for several years. He tried switching back to a vegetarian diet, but once again returned to limited consumption of meat. This attracted public attention when, during a visit to the White House, he was offered a vegetarian menu but declined by replying, as he is known to do on occasion when dining in the company of non-vegetarians, "I'm a Tibetan monk, not a vegetarian".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Iyer |first=Pico |title=The Open Road: The Global Journey of the Fourteenth Dalai Lama |publisher=Knopf Publishing Group |date=2008 |page=203 |url=https://books.google.co.za/books?id=ExP5VoHTyzgC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; His own home kitchen, however, is completely vegetarian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.shabkar.org/teachers/tibetanbuddhism/dalai_lama.htm |title = H.H.

=== Economics ===
The Dalai Lama has referred to himself as a [[Marxism|Marxist]] and has articulated [[Criticism of capitalism|criticisms of capitalism]].&lt;ref name="angrymarxist"&gt;{{cite web |title = The (Justifiably) Angry Marxist: An interview with the Dalai Lama |url = http://www.tricycle.com/blog/justifiably-angry-marxist-interview-dalai-lama |publisher = [[Tricycle: The Buddhist Review]] |accessdate = 6 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GuardMarx" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Catherine Phillips (15 January 2015).

He reports hearing of [[communism]] when he was very young, but only in the context of the destruction of [[Mongolian People's Republic|Communist Mongolia]].

{{quote|Of all the modern economic theories, the economic system of [[Marxism]] is founded on moral principles, while [[capitalism]] is concerned only with gain and profitability. Marxism is concerned with the distribution of wealth on an equal basis and the equitable utilisation of the [[means of production]].

The Dalai Lama is outspoken in his concerns about [[environmental problem]]s, frequently giving public talks on themes related to the environment.

A monk since childhood, the Dalai Lama has said that sex offers fleeting satisfaction and leads to trouble later, while chastity offers a better life and "more independence, more freedom".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.news24.com/World/News/Dalai-Lama-Sex-spells-trouble-20081128 |title=Dalai Lama: Sex spells trouble |date=2008-11-28 |agency=[[News24.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has observed that problems arising from conjugal life sometimes even lead to suicide or murder.&lt;ref name=Teleg&gt;{{cite news |author = Published: 5:18&amp;nbsp;pm GMT 29 November 2008 |url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/religion/3534994/Sexual-intercourse-spells-trouble-says-Dalai-Lama.html |title = Sexual intercourse spells trouble, says Dalai Lama |publisher = Telegraph.co.uk |date = 29 November 2008 |accessdate = 2 May 2010|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has asserted that all religions have the same view about adultery.&lt;ref name="foxsports1"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://msn.foxsports.com/golf/story/The-Dalai-Lama-comments-on-Tiger-Woods%2527-scandal?GT1=39002 |title = The Dalai Lama comments on Tiger Woods' scandal |publisher = FOX Sports |date = 2010-02-20 |accessdate = 9 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation not found}}

In his discussions of the traditional Buddhist view on appropriate sexual behavior, he explains the concept of "right organ in the right object at the right time," which historically has been interpreted as indicating that oral, manual and anal sex (both homosexual and heterosexual) are not appropriate in Buddhism or for Buddhists. However, he also says that in modern times all common, consensual sexual practices that do not cause harm to others are ethically acceptable and that society should accept and respect people who are [[gay]] or [[transgender]] from a secular point of view.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/hom_budd2.htm|title=Buddhism and homosexuality|website=www.religioustolerance.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1994 interview with ''[[OUT Magazine]]'', the Dalai Lama clarified his personal opinion on the matter by saying, "If someone comes to me and asks whether [[homosexuality]] is okay or not, I will ask 'What is your companion's opinion?' If you both agree, then I think I would say, 'If two males or two females voluntarily agree to have mutual satisfaction without further implication of harming others, then it is okay.'"&lt;ref&gt;OUT Magazine February/March 1994&lt;/ref&gt; However, when interviewed by Canadian TV news anchor [[Evan Solomon]] on ''[[CBC News: Sunday]]'' about whether homosexuality is acceptable in Buddhism, the Dalai Lama responded that "it is sexual misconduct".&lt;ref&gt;The Huffington Post, 07/13/09, Gay Marriage: What Would Buddha Do?, http://www.huffingtonpost.com/james-shaheen/gay-marriage-what-would-b_b_230855.html&lt;/ref&gt; This was an echo of an earlier response in a 2004 ''[[The Vancouver Sun]]'' interview when asked about homosexuality in Buddhism, where the Dalai Lama replied "for a Buddhist, the same sex, that is sexual misconduct".&lt;ref&gt;LifeSiteNews, 11/02/07/, The Dalai Lama, Like the Pope, Says Gay Sex is "Sexual Misconduct", http://www.lifesitenews.com/news/archive/ldn/2007/nov/07110208&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1996 book ''Beyond Dogma'', he described a traditional Buddhist definition of an appropriate sexual act as follows: "A sexual act is deemed proper when the couples use the organs intended for sexual intercourse and nothing else [  ... ] Homosexuality, whether it is between men or between women, is not improper in itself. What is improper is the use of organs already defined as inappropriate for sexual contact."&lt;ref&gt;Beyond Dogma by the Dalai Lama&lt;/ref&gt; He elaborated in 1997, explaining that the basis of that teaching was unknown to him. He also conveyed his own "willingness to consider the possibility that some of the teachings may be specific to a particular cultural and historic context".&lt;ref&gt;"Dalai Lama Urges 'Respect, Compassion, and Full Human Rights for All', including Gays". Conkin, Dennis. ''Bay Area Reporter'', 19 June 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dalai Lama has expressed concern at "reports of violence and discrimination against gay, [[bisexual]], and [[transgender]] people" and "urges respect, tolerance and the full recognition of human rights for all".&lt;ref&gt;Press Release in WORLD, 24/04/2006, HIS HOLINESS THE DALAI LAMA ISSUES STATEMENT IN SUPPORT OF HUMAN RIGHTS OF LESBIAN, GAY, BISEXUAL AND TRANSGENDER PEOPLE, {{cite web|url=http://ilga.org/ilga/en/article/782 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-11-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130623030316/http://ilga.org/ilga/en/article/782 |archivedate=23 June 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, he said that the next Dalai Lama could possibly be a woman, remarking "If a woman reveals herself as more useful the lama could very well be reincarnated in this form".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Spencer |first=Richard |url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/1571850/Dalai-Lama-says-successor-could-be-a-woman.html |title = Dalai Lama says successor could be a woman |publisher = Telegraph.co.uk |date = 2007-12-07 |accessdate = 2010-11-19 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, on [[gender equality]] and sexism, the Dalai Lama proclaimed at the [[National Civil Rights Museum]] in [[Memphis, Tennessee]]: "I call myself a [[feminist]]. Isn't that what you call someone who fights for [[women's rights]]?" He also said that by nature, women are more compassionate "based on their biology and ability to nurture and birth children". He called on women to "lead and create a more compassionate world", citing the good works of nurses and mothers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/tamara-conniff/the-dalai-lama-proclaims_b_297285.html |title = Tamara Conniff: The Dalai Lama Proclaims Himself a Feminist: Day Two of Peace and Music in Memphis |publisher = Huffington Post |date = 23 September 2009 |accessdate = 17 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, the Dalai Lama attended the inauguration of the Secular Ethics for Higher Education Course at the [[Tata Institute of Social Sciences]] (TISS) in Mumbai, where he was reported to have stated that, "Since women have been shown to be more sensitive to others' suffering, their leadership may be more effective. His Holiness suggested it's time for men to withdraw and for women to step forward."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Secular Ethics for Higher Education |url=https://www.dalailama.com/news/2017/launch-of-tata-institute-of-social-sciences-course-in-secular-ethics-for-higher-education/amp |website=HIS HOLINESS The 14th DALAI LAMA of TIBET |publisher=THE OFFICE OF HIS HOLINESS THE DALAI LAMA |accessdate=13 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, he said in a BBC interview that if a female succeeded him, "that female must be attractive, otherwise it is not much use," and when asked if he was joking, replied, "No. True!" He followed with a joke about his current success being due to his own appearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Dalai Lama Says If Successor Is Female, She Must Be Very Attractive |url = http://www.tricycle.com/blog/dalai-lama-says-if-successor-female-she-must-be-very-attractive |publisher = [[Tricycle: The Buddhist Review]] |date = 22 September 2015 |accessdate = 24 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Health ===

In April 2013, at the Culture of Compassion event in Ebrington Square in [[Derry]], [[Northern Ireland]], the Dalai Lama asserted, stressing the importance of peace of mind: "Warm-heartedness is a key factor for healthy individuals, healthy families and healthy communities [  ... ] Scientists say that a healthy mind is a major factor for a healthy body. If you're serious about your health, think and take most concern for your peace of mind. That's very, very important."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/18/dalai-lama-culture-of-com_n_3111216.html |title = Dalai Lama 'Culture of Compassion' Talk: Key To Good Health Is 'Peace Of Mind' (VIDEO) |work = Huffington Post |date = 2013-04-18 |accessdate = 17 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Immigration ===

In September 2018, speaking at a conference in Sweden's third-largest city, Malmo, home to a large immigrant population, the Dalai Lama said "I think Europe belongs to the Europeans," he said, adding they should make clear to refugees that "they ultimately should rebuild their own country".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.france24.com/en/20180912-dalai-lama-says-europe-belongs-europeans|title=Dalai Lama says 'Europe belongs to Europeans'|date=12 September 2018|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/government-economy/dalai-lama-says-europe-belongs-to-europeans|title=Dalai Lama says 'Europe belongs to Europeans'|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, Speaking to German reporters the Dalai Lama said "too many" refugees are seeking asylum in Europe," adding that "Europe, for example Germany, cannot become an Arab country". He also said that Germany is Germany. "There are so many that in practice it becomes difficult."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2016/05/31/the-dalai-lama-says-too-many-refugees-are-going-to-germany/|title=The Dalai Lama says 'too many' refugees are going to Germany|first=|last=https://www.facebook.com/max.bearak|website=Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/world/migrant-crisis-dalai-lama-says-germany-cannot-become-an-arab-country-20160601-gp8mhr.html|title=Migrant crisis: Dalai Lama says Germany 'cannot become an Arab country'|first=Max|last=Bearak|date=31 May 2016|website=The Sydney Morning Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Retirement and succession plans ==

On 29 May 2011, the Dalai Lama retired from the [[Central Tibetan Administration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = His Holiness the Dalai Lama's Remarks on Retirement – March 19th, 2011 |url = http://dalailama.com/messages/retirement/retirement-remarks |accessdate = 14 September 2014 |date = 19 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 September 2011, the Dalai Lama issued the following statement concerning his reincarnation:
&lt;blockquote&gt;When I am about ninety I will consult the high Lamas of the Tibetan Buddhist traditions, the Tibetan public, and other concerned people who follow Tibetan Buddhism, and re-evaluate whether the institution of the Dalai Lama should continue or not. On that basis we will take a decision. If it is decided that the reincarnation of the Dalai Lama should continue and there is a need for the Fifteenth Dalai Lama to be recognized, responsibility for doing so will primarily rest on the concerned officers of the Dalai Lama's Gaden Phodrang Trust. They should consult the various heads of the Tibetan Buddhist traditions and the reliable oath-bound Dharma Protectors who are linked inseparably to the lineage of the Dalai Lamas. They should seek advice and direction from these concerned beings and carry out the procedures of search and recognition in accordance with past tradition. I shall leave clear written instructions about this. Bear in mind that, apart from the reincarnation recognized through such legitimate methods, no recognition or acceptance should be given to a candidate chosen for political ends by anyone, including those in the People's Republic of China.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dalailama.com/news/post/753-statement-of-his-holiness-the-fourteenth-dalai-lama-tenzin-gyatso-on-the-issue-of-his-reincarnation Statement of His Holiness the Fourteenth Dalai Lama, Tenzin Gyatso, on the Issue of His Reincarnation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130204002812/http://www.dalailama.com/news/post/753-statement-of-his-holiness-the-fourteenth-dalai-lama-tenzin-gyatso-on-the-issue-of-his-reincarnation |date=4 February 2013 }} [http://www.dalailama.com/ Website of His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama of Tibet] 24 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On 3 October 2011, the Dalai Lama repeated his statement in an interview with Canadian [[CTV News]]. He added that Chinese laws banning the selection of successors based on reincarnation will not impact his decisions. "Naturally my next life is entirely up to me. No one else. And also this is not a political matter," he said in the interview. The Dalai Lama also added that he was not decided on whether he would reincarnate or be the last Dalai Lama.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher = CTV |title = CTV Exclusive: Dalai Lama will choose successor |date = 3 October 2011 |url = http://www.ctvnews.ca/old-ctv-national-news/ctv-exclusive-dalai-lama-will-choose-successor-1.706189 |accessdate = 27 June 2014 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20141006101945/http://www.ctvnews.ca/old-ctv-national-news/ctv-exclusive-dalai-lama-will-choose-successor-1.706189 |archive-date = 6 October 2014 |dead-url = yes |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with the German newspaper ''Welt am Sonntag'' published on 7 September 2014 the Dalai Lama stated "the institution of the Dalai Lama has served its purpose", and that "We had a Dalai Lama for almost five centuries. The 14th Dalai Lama now is very popular.

Gyatso has also expressed fear that the Chinese government would manipulate any reincarnation selection in order to choose a successor that would go along with their political goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/916409066|title=Religions in the modern world : traditions and transformations|others=Woodhead, Linda,, Partridge, Christopher H.

== Controversies ==

=== CIA Tibetan program ===
{{Main|CIA Tibetan program}}

In October 1998, the Dalai Lama's administration acknowledged that it received $1.7&amp;nbsp;million a year in the 1960s from the U.S. government through the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA).&lt;ref name="tnyt 10-2-1998"&gt;{{cite news |title = World News Briefs; Dalai Lama Group Says It Got Money From C.I.A. |url = http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F3061EF73E5C0C718CDDA90994D0494D81&amp;n=Top%2fReference%2fTimes%20Topics%2fPeople%2fD%2fDalai%20Lama |date = 2 October 1998|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; When asked by CIA officer John Kenneth Knaus in 1995 to comment on the [[CIA Tibetan program]], the Dalai Lama replied that though it helped the morale of those resisting the Chinese, "thousands of lives were lost in the resistance" and further, that "the U.S. Government had involved itself in his country's affairs not to help Tibet but only as a Cold War tactic to challenge the Chinese."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author = William Blum |url = http://members.aol.com/superogue/intro.htm |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080321053809/http://members.aol.com/superogue/intro.htm |archivedate=21 March 2008 |title = Rogue State: A Guide to the World's Only Superpower |publisher = Zed Books|year=2006 |accessdate = 2 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his autobiography ''[[Freedom in Exile]]'', the Dalai Lama criticized the CIA again for supporting the [[Tibetan independence movement]] "not because they (the CIA) cared about Tibetan independence, but as part of their worldwide efforts to destabilize all [[communist]] [[Executive (government)|governments]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = CIA Gave Aid to Tibetan Exiles in '60s, Files Show |url = http://articles.latimes.com/1998/sep/15/news/mn-22993|work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |accessdate = 8 September 2013 |quote = In his 1990 autobiography, 'Freedom in Exile', the Dalai Lama explained that his two brothers made contact with the CIA during a trip to India in 1956.

In 1999, the Dalai Lama said that the [[CIA Tibetan program]] had been harmful for Tibet because it was primarily aimed at serving American interests, and "once the [[Foreign policy of the United States|American policy]] toward China changed, they stopped their help."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Jonathan Mirsky |title = Tibet: The CIA's Cancelled War |url = http://www.nybooks.com/blogs/nyrblog/2013/apr/09/cias-cancelled-war-tibet/ |work=[[The New York Review of Books]] |accessdate = 3 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ties to India ===
[[File:Plaque at AP Museum, Amaravathi.jpg|250px|thumb|Stone Plaque at a plantation by Tenzin in Amaravathi]]
The [[Media of the People's Republic of China|Chinese press]] has criticized the Dalai Lama for his close ties with India. His 2010 remarks at the [[International Buddhist Conference]] in [[Gujarat]] saying that he was "Tibetan in appearance, but an Indian in spirituality" and referral to himself as a "son of India" in particular led the ''[[People's Daily]]'' to opine, "Since the Dalai Lama deems himself an Indian rather than Chinese, then why is he entitled to represent the voice of the Tibetan people?"&lt;ref name="heart"&gt;{{Cite news |url = http://chinatibet.people.com.cn/6876597.html |title = A look at the Dalai Lama's ridiculous Indian heart |date = 2010-01-22 |accessdate = 17 August 2010 |publisher = China Tibet Information Center}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dhundup Gyalpo of the ''[[Tibet Sun]]'' shot back that Tibetan religion could be traced back to [[Nalanda]] in India, and that Tibetans have no connection to Chinese "apart  ... from a handful of culinary dishes".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url = http://www.tibetsun.com/opinions/2010/02/09/why-is-the-dalai-lama-son-of-india |title = Why is the Dalai Lama "son of India"? |first = Dhundup |last = Gyalpo |location = Dharamshala |date = 2010-02-09 |accessdate = 18 August 2010 |publisher = [[Tibet Sun]] |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110717053610/http://www.tibetsun.com/opinions/2010/02/09/why-is-the-dalai-lama-son-of-india |archive-date = 17 July 2011 |dead-url = yes |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''People's Daily'' stressed the links between [[Chinese Buddhism]] and [[Tibetan Buddhism]] and accused the Dalai Lama of "betraying [[South Tibet|southern Tibet]] to India".&lt;ref name="heart" /&gt; In 2008, the Dalai Lama said for the first time that the territory India claims as part of [[Arunachal Pradesh]] is part of India, citing the disputed [[Simla Accord (1914)|1914 Simla Accord]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = Tawang is part of India: Dalai Lama |publisher = TNN |date = 4 June 2008 |url = http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/India/Tawang_is_part_of_India_Dalai_Lama_/articleshow/3097568.cms |accessdate = 4 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Shugden controversy ===
{{Main|Dorje Shugden controversy}}
The Dorje Shugden Controversy reappeared in the Gelug school by the publication of the ''Yellow Book'' in 1976, containing stories about wrathful acts of ''Dorje Shugden'' against Gelugpas who also practiced [[Nyingma]] teachings. In response, the 14th Dalai Lama, a Gelugpa himself and advocate of an "inclusive" approach to the teachings of Tibetan Buddhism,{{sfn|Mills|2003}}{{sfn|Kay|2004}} started to speak out against the practice of Dorje Shugden in 1978.{{sfn|Kay|2004|p=47}}

The controversy has attracted attention in the West because of demonstrations held in 2008 and 2014 by Dorje Shugden practitioners. A 2015 [[Reuters]] investigation determined "that the religious sect behind the protests has the backing of the Communist Party" and that the "group has emerged as an instrument in Beijing's long campaign to undermine support for the Dalai Lama".&lt;ref&gt;Lague, David.

=== Gedhun Choekyi Nyima ===
In April 2018, the [[Dalai Lama]] confirmed the official Chinese claims about [[Gedhun Choekyi Nyima]] by saying that he knew from "reliable sources" that the Panchen Lama he had recognized was alive and receiving normal education. He said he hoped that the official Panchen Lama ([[Gyaincain Norbu]]) studied well under the guidance of a good teacher, adding that there were instances in Tibetan Buddhist tradition, of a reincarnated lama taking more than one manifestation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thestatesman.com/india/11th-panchen-lama-alive-receiving-education-dalai-lama-1502627372.html 11th Panchen Lama alive, receiving education: Dalai Lama], ''The Statesman'', April 25, 2018: "Tibetan spiritual leader Dalai Lama on Wednesday said 11th Panchen Lama Gedhun Choekyi Nyima "according to reliable source is alive and receiving normal education".

"Then the Panchen Lama, which I recognised sometime back, there was no news, but then according to reliable information, he is still alive and receiving normal education. So we will see," he said.

The Dalai Lama's appeal is variously ascribed to his charismatic personality, international fascination with Buddhism, his [[universalist]] values, international sympathy for the Tibetans, and western [[sinophobia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url = https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2010/dec/15/china-dalai-lama-exile-tibetans |title = The Next Dalai Lama: China has a choice|first=Dibyesh|last=Anand |publisher = The Guardian |date = 2010-12-15 |accessdate = 19 December 2010 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1990s, many films were released by the [[Cinema of the United States|American film industry]] about Tibet, including [[biopics]] of the Dalai Lama. This is attributed to both the Dalai Lama's 1989 Nobel Peace Prize as well as to the euphoria following the [[Fall of Communism]]. The most notable films, ''[[Kundun]]'' and ''[[Seven Years in Tibet (1997 film)|Seven Years in Tibet]]'' (both released in 1997), portrayed "an idyllic pre-1950 Tibet, with a smiling, soft-spoken Dalai Lama at the helm – a Dalai Lama sworn to [[non-violence]]": portrayals the Chinese government decried as [[ahistorical]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title = Tibet |first=Michael |last=Buckley |publisher = [[Bradt Travel Guides]] |year=2006 |edition=2 |ISBN = 978-1-84162-164-7 |page = 35 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=VrMcNDdB5-MC&amp;pg=PA35 |accessdate = 5 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Raden Ahmad Soebardjo Djojoadisoerjo''' ([[Karawang Regency]], [[West Java]], 23 March 1896 – 15 December 1978) was a diplomat, one of [[Indonesia]]'s [[founding father]]s, and an Indonesian national hero. He was the first [[Foreign Minister]] of [[Indonesia]]. In 1933, he received the degree ''[[Master of Law|Meester in de Rechten]]'' from [[Leiden University]], [[Netherlands]].

==Early life==
Ahmad Soebardjo was born in Teluk Jambe, [[Karawang Regency]], [[West Java]], on 23 March 1896. His father's name was Teuku Muhammad Yusuf,&lt;ref name=Tempo75/&gt; an [[Acehnese people|Acehnese]] patrician from [[Pidie]].&lt;ref name=Ikbal/&gt;&lt;ref name=Tempo78/&gt; His paternal grandfather was an [[ulama]] and his father was the chief of police in Teluk Jambe, Karawang.&lt;ref name=Ikbal/&gt; His mother's name was Wardinah.&lt;ref name=Ikbal&gt;''[http://ikbalblog.blogspot.com/2010/04/normal-0-false-false-false-en-us-x-none.html Ahmad Soebardjo Djoyoadisuryo, SH.]'', Source: Otobiografi Ahmad Soebardjo, Seputar Proklamasi Mohammad Hatta, data online, ''in'' Catatan 'Seorang' Ikbal, 19 April 2010.

Retrieved 7 February 2011. {{id icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was daughter from ''Camat'' in Telukagung, [[Cirebon]].&lt;ref name=Ikbal/&gt;

Initially, his father gave him the name '''Teuku Abdul Manaf''', but his mother gave him the name Ahmad Subardjo.&lt;ref name=Tempo75/&gt; Djojoadisoerjo was added by himself after he was arrested and imprisoned in [[Ponorogo]] Prison because of his involvement with the "[[July 3, 1946 Incident]]".&lt;ref name=Tempo78&gt;''[http://majalah.tempointeraktif.com/id/arsip/1978/12/23/NAS/mbm.19781223.NAS73505.id.html Ahmad Subardjo (1896–1978)]'', 23 December 1978. Retrieved 7 February 2011. {{id icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He studied at [[Hogere Burger School]], [[Jakarta]] in 1917. He continued to [[Leiden University]], Netherlands and obtained the degree ''[[Master of Law|Meester in de Rechten]]'' title in the field of law in 1933.

==Struggle==
As a student, he was active in the fight for [[Indonesian independence]] through several organizations such as [[Jong Java]] and the Indonesian Students Association in the Netherlands, the [[Perhimpoenan Indonesia]]. In February 1927, Soebardjo, [[Mohammad Hatta]], and three other students represented Indonesia at the conferences of the [[League against Imperialism]] in Brussels and later in Germany. At the founding congress in Brussels, Soebardjo and the others met [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] and others nationalist leaders from Asia and Africa. Soebardjo even spent a couple of months in Berlin and Moscow working for the International Secretariat of the League against Imperialism. Upon return to Indonesia, he became a member of the [[Investigating Committee for Preparatory Work for Independence]] (BPUPK).

On 19 August 1945, two days after the [[Proclamation of Indonesian Independence]] on 17 August 1945, Sukarno appointed Soebardjo as the [[Minister of Foreign Affairs]] of the [[Presidential Cabinet (Indonesia)|Presidential Cabinet]], Indonesia's first cabinet for 4 months and immediately started the first Foreign Ministry office at his own residence in Jalan Cikini raya. Subardjo served as Minister of Foreign Affairs once again from 1951 to 1952 in [[Sukiman Cabinet|Sukiman's Cabinet]]. In addition, he also became the Ambassador of the Republic of Indonesia to [[Switzerland]] from 1957 to 1961.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://menluri.info/web/mr-ahmad-subardjo-djojoadisurjo.html |title=Mr. Ahmad Subardjo Djojoadisurjo |date=16 January 2010 |accessdate=3 June 2011 |language=id |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100528142558/http://menluri.info/web/mr-ahmad-subardjo-djojoadisurjo.html |archivedate=28 May 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
Ahebi Ugbabe was born in the later part of the 19th cetnury to Ugbabe Ayibi, a farmer and palm wine tapper, and Anekwu Ameh, a farmer and trader, in Umuida, [[Enugu-Ezike]]. She had two brothers and no sisters.&lt;ref name="Achebe38"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Achebe|first1=Nwando|title=The Female King of Colonial Nigeria: Ahebi Ugbabe|date=2010|publisher=Indiana University Press|location=Bloomington|isbn=0253222486|pages=38–39}}&lt;/ref&gt; She lived with her mother's family in Unadu for a brief period before returning to Umuida. After her return, she did not stay long before running away.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Masculinities-Modern-Africa-Social-History/dp/0325002541|title=Men and Masculinities in Modern Africa|last=Lindsay|first=Lisa A.|date=2003-06-20|publisher=Heinemann|isbn=9780325002545|editor-last=Miescher|editor-first=Stephan|location=Portsmouth, NH|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Exile ==
She later had to escape to [[Igala Kingdom|Igalaland]]. Ahebi was running from an order for her to be married to a female deity as punishment for her father's crime. This punishment was known as ''igo mma ogo'' (to become the inlaw of a deity). Her family had gone through a series of unfortunate events when she thirteen and fourteen. The farm yielded little, illness spread, and trading was slow. Her father had gone to a diviner, someone who was perceived as knowing the unknown. This man had correlated the events to the wrath of the goddess Ohe due to his crime. &lt;ref name="Achebe2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jell-Bahlsen|first=Sabine|date=2012|title=Review of The Female King of Colonial Nigeria, Ahebi Ugbabe|jstor=24392949|journal=The International Journal of African Historical Studies|volume=45|issue=2|pages=305–310}}&lt;/ref&gt; During her forced exile, Ahebi became a prostitute and used this form of work to her advantage. Along her travels, Ahebi learned to speak numerous languages, such as "Igala, Nupe, and Pidgin English. Her success and independence helped to redefine sex work in Igbo culture, from servitude to a voluntary profession. Chinua Achebe wrote that "Achebe furthermore sets out to introduce 'the concept of 'wife of a deity' and extends the analytical category of 'autonomous sex worker' as models through which to engage with continuities and change in conceptions of female enslavement as well as competing and overlapping definitions of prostitution in an African context" &lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  Her sex work and linguistic skills gave her access to the Attah-Igala (king) and the British divisional officer, who not only facilitated her return to Enugu-Ezike, but supported her claim to the office of headman, warrant chief, and, later, eze."

== Ahebi's Rule ==
Ahebi's reign began a few months after she returned to Igboland from exile.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cDYL4unSDHkC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q=few%20months%20of%20her%20return&amp;f=false|title=The Female King of Colonial Nigeria: Ahebi Ugbabe|last=Achebe|first=Nwando|date=2011|publisher=Indiana University Press|year=|isbn=0253222486|location=|pages=99–100|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ahebi was the only person in her village able to speak with the British. She replaced "the aged (and increasingly incompetent)"&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cDYL4unSDHkC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q=few%20months%20of%20her%20return&amp;f=false|title=The Female King of Colonial Nigeria: Ahebi Ugbabe|last=Achebe|first=Nwando|date=2011|publisher=Indiana University Press|year=|isbn=0253222486|location=|pages=172|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; headman Ugwu Okegwu who was unable to communicate with the British. She was made the only woman warrant chief in all of colonial Nigeria in the British Native court. British District Officer W. H. Lloyd said Ahebi was "a lady of influence and power. She is intelligent and of a quiet disposition. When she does speak, it is usually to the point and sensible."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Although Ahebi commanded the respect of her people, she sewed seeds of resentment by conscripting forced labor and imposing a census and a British tax. The Igbo people "did not believe that human beings should ever be counted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cDYL4unSDHkC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q=few%20months%20of%20her%20return&amp;f=false|title=The Female King of Colonial Nigeria: Ahebi Ugbabe|last=Achebe|first=Nwando|date=2011|publisher=Indiana University Press|year=|isbn=0253222486|location=|pages=122|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This census caused the [[Women's War|Woman's War]] in southern Igboland.

At first, "Ahebi easily quelled whatever resistance to her kingship existed" because of her British backing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cDYL4unSDHkC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q=few%20months%20of%20her%20return&amp;f=false|title=The Female King of Colonial Nigeria: Ahebi Ugbabe|last=Achebe|first=Nwando|date=2011|publisher=Indiana University Press|year=|isbn=0253222486|location=|pages=133|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ahebi amassed wealth and power, but ultimately fell from grace when the extent of her multiple—gender and power—transgressions became too much for her community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Achebe|first=Nwando|date=June 2012|title=The Female King of Colonial Nigeria, Ahebi Ugbabe|url=www.jstor.org/stable/2439294|journal=International Journal of African Historical Studies|volume=vol. 45|pages=306|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt; She overreached in her ambition and violated a social more by attending a spiritual masquerade ritual with her own mask.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; This ritual was only for people assigned male at birth. The male elders and Ahebi went to court to settle the case and the British sided with the male elders, undermining Ahebi's rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cDYL4unSDHkC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q=few%20months%20of%20her%20return&amp;f=false|title=The Female King of Colonial Nigeria: Ahebi Ugbabe|last=Achebe|first=Nwando|date=2011|publisher=Indiana University Press|year=|isbn=0253222486|location=|pages=183|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ahebi Ugbabe cultivated an aura of mysticism to solidify an image of all powerful rule. She used pre-colonial traditions to push this mysticism and therefore power. She also used this to augment her gender to effectively make herself king. Another way that Ahebi asserted herself as a man was she collected multiple wives, many of whom were runaways from abusive husbands. She also had multiple servants who would help her. These wives would bear children to continue Ahebi's name.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cDYL4unSDHkC&amp;pg=PA232&amp;lpg=PA232&amp;dq=and+she+became+a+man+nwando+achebe&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=oLXoSXod1e&amp;sig=je8Bc9rM_m0PT4bq_HMDjcO9r4k&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjTuYiEh8TXAhVF7WMKHdrhBBkQ6AEIQzAF#v=onepage&amp;q=and%20she%20became%20a%20man%20nwando%20achebe&amp;f=false|title=The Female King of Colonial Nigeria: Ahebi Ugbabe|last=Achebe|first=Nwando|date=2011|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=0253222486|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Death ==
Before Ahebi died, she performed her own burial rites. She "did not trust that her society would accord her a befitting burial."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cDYL4unSDHkC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q=few%20months%20of%20her%20return&amp;f=false|title=The Female King of Colonial Nigeria: Ahebi Ugbabe|last=Achebe|first=Nwando|date=2011|publisher=Indiana University Press|year=|isbn=0253222486|location=|pages=187|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; She intended to perform the rites "in such a magnificent manner that her society would never forget that an incredible being such as herself had lived."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Her living funeral included gunfire, animal sacrifice, and glorious music of remembrance.

Ahebi died in 1948.&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt; Although she was a woman, she was buried according to the local customs for burying men.&lt;ref name="Achebe189"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Achebe|first1=Nwando|title=The Female King of Colonial Nigeria: Ahebi Ugbabe|date=2010|publisher=Indiana University Press|location=Bloomington|isbn=0253222486|page=189}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ahmadou Babatoura Ahidjo''' (24 August 1924 – 30 November 1989) was a [[Cameroon|Cameroonian]] politician who was the first [[List of Presidents of Cameroon|President of Cameroon]], holding the office from 1960 until 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Ahmadou-Ahidjo|title=Ahmadou Ahidjo {{!}} president of Cameroon|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-11-03|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Ahidjo was born in [[Garoua]], a major [[river port]] along the [[Benue River]] in northern [[Cameroun]], which was at the time a [[France|French]] [[mandate territory]].&lt;ref name="Glickman1"&gt;{{Harvnb|Glickman|1992|p=1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  His mother was a Fulani of slave descent, while his father was a [[Fula people|Fulani]] village chief.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

Ahidjo's mother raised him as a [[Muslim]] and sent him to [[Qur'an|Quranic]] school as a child. In 1932, he began attending local government primary school. After failing his first school certification examination in 1938, Ahidjo worked for a few months in the veterinary service. He returned to school and obtained his school certification a year later.&lt;ref name="Glickman1"/&gt; Ahidjo spent the next three years attending secondary school at the Ecole Primaire Supérieur in [[Yaoundé]], the capital of the mandate, studying for a career in the civil service. At school, Ahidjo also played [[soccer]] and competed as a [[cyclist]].&lt;ref name="Glickman1"/&gt;

In 1942, Ahidjo joined the [[civil service]] as a [[radio operator]] for a [[postal administration|postal service]]. As part of his job, he worked on assignments in several major cities throughout the country, such as [[Douala]], [[Ngaoundéré]], [[Bertoua]], and [[Mokolo]]. According to his official biographer, Ahidjo was the first civil servant from northern Cameroun to work in the southern areas of the territory.&lt;ref name="Glickman1"/&gt; His experiences throughout the country were, according to Harvey Glickman, [[professor emeritus]] of [[political science]] at [[Haverford College]] and scholar of African politics, responsible for fostering his sense of national identity and provided him the sagacity to handle the problems of governing a [[multiethnic state]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Glickman|1992|pp=1–2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political career==
In 1946, Ahidjo entered territorial politics. From January 28, 1957, to May 10, 1957, Ahidjo served as President of the Legislative Assembly of Cameroon. In the same year he became Deputy Prime Minister in ''de facto'' head of state [[André-Marie Mbida]]'s government. While serving as Prime Minister, Ahidjo had administrative goals to move toward independence for Cameroon while reuniting the separated factions of the country and cooperating with French colonial powers. On June 12, with a motion from the [[National Assembly (Cameroon)|National Assembly]], Ahidjo became involved in negotiations with France in Paris. These negotiations continued through October, resulting in formal recognition of Cameroonian plans for independence. &lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{cite book |last1=LeVine |first1=Victor |title=The Cameroons from Mandate to Independence |date=1964 |publisher=Greenwood Press |location=Westport, Connecticut |isbn=0-8371-8764-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The date for the simultaneous termination of French trusteeship and Cameroonian independence was set by Cameroon's National Assembly for January 1, 1960.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Awasom|first1=Nicodemus Fru|date=Winter 2002|title=Politics and Constitution-Making in Francophone Cameroon, 1959-1960|journal=Africa Today|volume=49|issue=4|pages=3-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

Ahidjo's support and collaboration in allowing for continued French influence economically and politically was faced with opposition from radicals who rejected French influence. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Middleton|first1=John|last2=Miller|first2=Joseph|date=2008|title=Ahidjo, El Hajj Ahmadou (1924-1989)|journal=New Encyclopedia of Africa|volume=1|pages=29-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; These radicals were sympathetic to a more revolutionary, procommunist approach to decolonization. They formed their own political party, [[Union des populations du Cameroun|Union des Populations du Cameroun.]] In March 1959, Ahidjo addressed the [[United Nations]] General Assembly in order to gather support for France's independence plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brennan|first1=Carol|date=2010|title=Ahidjo, Ahmadou|journal=Contemporary Black Bioraphy|volume=81|pages=1-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Influenced by [[Cold War]] tensions, the United Nations expressed concern about the UPC due to the party's pro-communist disposition. The United Nations moved to end French trusteeship in Cameroon without organizing new elections or lifting the ban that France had imposed on the UPC. Ahidjo experienced a rebellion in the 1960s from the UPC, but defeated it by 1970 with the aid of French military force. Ahidjo proposed and was granted four bills to gather power and declare a state of emergency in order to end the rebellion.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Following the independence of the French-controlled area of Cameroon, Ahidjo's focus turned on reuniting the British-controlled area of Cameroon with its newly independent counterpart. In addressing the United Nations, Ahidjo and his supporters favored integration and reunification whereas more radical players such as the UPC preferred immediate reunification. However, both sides were seeking a [[plebiscite]] for reunification of the separated Cameroons. The UN decided on the integration and reunification plebiscite. The plebiscite resulted in northern area of the [[British Cameroons]] voting to join [[Nigeria]] and the southern area voting to reunite with the rest of Cameroon.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chem-Langhëë|first=Bongfen|date=1995|title=The Road to the Unitary State of Cameroon 1959-1972|url=|journal=Paideuma: Mitteilungen zur Kultukunde|publisher=Frobenius Institute|volume=41|pages=17-25|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ahidjo worked with Premier [[John Ngu Foncha|John Foncha]] of the Anglophone Cameroon throughout the process of integrating the two parts of Cameroon. In July 1961, Ahidjo attended a conference at which the plans and conditions for merging the Cameroons were made and later adopted by both the National Assemblies of the Francophone and Anglophone Cameroons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=March 2014|title=Cameroon: A country united|url=|journal=New African London|volume=537|pages=36-39|via=ProQuest}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ahidjo and Foncha met in Bamenda in order to create a constitution for the united territories. In their meetings, Ahidjo and Foncha agreed not to join the French community or the [[Commonwealth]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In the summer of 1961, Ahidjo and Foncha resolved any issues between them and agreed upon the final draft for the constitution, which was drawn in [[Foumban]], a city in West Cameroon.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1027808253|title=Post-colonial Cameroon : politics, economy, and society|others=Takougang, Joseph,, Amin, Julius A.,|isbn=9781498564632|location=Lanham, Maryland|oclc=1027808253}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Anglophone Cameroon Predicament|last=Atanga|first=Mufor|publisher=Langaa Research &amp; Publishing Common Initiative Group|year=2011|isbn=9956-717-11-8|location=Mankon, Bamenda|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; On October 1, 1961, the two separate Cameroons were merged, establishing the Federal Republic of Cameroon with Ahidjo as the president and Foncha as the Vice President.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ten African Heroes: The sweep of independence in Black Africa|last=Melady|first=Thomas|last2=Melady|first2=Margaret Badum|publisher=Orbis Books|year=2011|isbn=978-1-57075-929-1|location=Maryknoll, NY|pages=152-163}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On March 12, 1962, Ahidjo issued a decree that prevented criticism against his regime, giving the government the authority to imprison anyone found guilty of subversion against government authorities or laws.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Takougang|first=Joseph|date=Fall 1993|title=The Post-Ahidjo Era in Cameroon: Continuity and Change|url=|journal=Journal of Third World Studies|volume=10|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1962, a group of opposition party leaders who had served in the government with Ahidjo, André-Marie Mbida, Charles Okala, Marcel Bey Bey Eyidi, and Theodore Mayi Martip, challenged Ahidjo's call for a single-party state, saying that it was dictatorial. These leaders were arrested, tried, and imprisoned on the grounds of subversion against the government.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The arrest of these leaders resulted in many other opposition leaders joining Ahidjo's Party, the [[Union Camerounaise]].&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; On September 1, 1966, Ahidjo achieved his goal of creating a single-party state. The [[Cameroon National Union]] was established, with Ahidjo maintaining that it was essential to the unity of Cameroon.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; 

Placing the blame for Cameroon's underdevelopment and poorly implemented town and public planning policies on Cameroon's federal structure, as well as charging federalism with maintaining cleavages and issues between the Anglophone and Francophone parts of Cameroon, Ahidjo announced on May 6, 1972, that he wanted to abolish the federation and put a unitary state into place if the electorate supported the idea in a referendum set for May 20, 1972.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/53284933|title=The leadership challenge in Africa : Cameroon under Paul Biya|date=2004|publisher=Africa World Press|others=Mbaku, John Mukum, 1950-, Takougang, Joseph.|isbn=9781592211784|location=Trenton, NJ|oclc=53284933}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ahidjo issued Presidential Decree No. 72-720 on June 2, 1972, which established the United Republic of Cameroon and abolished the federation.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; A [[Constitution of Cameroon|new constitution]] was adopted by Ahidjo's government in the same year, abolishing the position of Vice President, which served to further centralize power in Cameroon. Ahidjo's power presided over not only the state and government, but also as commander of the military.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kum Bao|first=Sammy|date=March 1, 1973|title=President Ahidjo's fifteen years|url=|journal=Africa Report|volume=18|pages=32, 33|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1975, however, Ahidjo instituted the position of Prime Minister, which was filled by [[Paul Biya]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In 1979, Ahidjo initiated a change in the constitution designating the Prime Minister as successor.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; 

In 1972, when Cameroon hosted the [[Africa Cup of Nations]], Ahidjo ordered the construction of two new stadiums, the [[Ahmadou Ahidjo Stadium|Ahmadou Ahidjo stadium]] and the Unification Stadium. The Unification Stadium was named in celebration of the country being renamed as the United Republic of Cameroon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/822227488|title=Fractures and reconnections : civic action and the redefinition of African spaces : studies in honor of Piet J.J. Konings|others=Abbink, J., Konings, Piet.|isbn=3643902565|location=Zürich|oclc=822227488}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Though many of his actions were dictatorial, Cameroon became one of the most stable in Africa. He was considered to be more conservative and less charismatic than most post-colonial African leaders, but his policies allowed Cameroon to attain comparative prosperity. Courtiers surrounding Ahidjo promoted the myth that he was "father of the nation."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Post-presidency ==
[[File:JFKWHP-KN-C20436.jpg|left|thumb|220px|Ahmadou Ahidjo at the [[White House]] with [[President Kennedy]], 1962]]

Ahidjo resigned, ostensibly for health reasons, on 4 November 1982 (there are many theories surrounding the resignation; it is generally believed that his French doctor "tricked" Ahidjo about his health)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.waado.org/nigerian_scholars/archive/debates/constitution/OmoigCoup.html On The Question of Preventing Coups in Nigeria by Nowamagbe A. Omoigui&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://dawodu.com/bakassi3.htm The Bakassi Story&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and was succeeded by Prime Minister Paul Biya two days later.&lt;ref name=Nature&gt;Joseph Takougang, "The Nature of Politics in Cameroon", ''The Leadership Challenge in Africa: Cameroon Under Paul Biya'' (2004), ed. John Mukum Mbaku and Joseph Takougang, page 78.&lt;/ref&gt; That he stepped down in favor of Biya, a [[Christianity|Christian]] from the south and not a [[Islam|Muslim]] from the north like himself, was considered surprising.  Ahidjo's ultimate intentions are unclear; it is possible that he intended to return to the presidency at a later point when his health improved, and another possibility is that he intended for [[Maigari Bello Bouba]], a fellow Muslim from the north who succeeded Biya as Prime Minister, to be his eventual successor as President, with Biya in effectively a caretaker role. Although the Central Committee of the ruling [[Cameroon National Union]] (CNU) urged Ahidjo to remain President, he declined to do so, but he did agree to remain as the President of the CNU. However, he also arranged for Biya to become the CNU Vice-President and handle party affairs in his absence. During the first few months of Biya's administration, there was cooperation between Biya and Ahidjo. In January 1982, Ahidjo dismissed four CNU members who opposed Biya's presidency.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cameroon: Dependence and Independence|last=DeLancey|first=Mark W.|publisher=Westview Press|year=1989|isbn=0-89158-882-5|location=Boulder, Colorado|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally that month, Ahidjo and Biya both went on separate speaking tours to different parts of Cameroon in order to address the public's concerns.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Later that year, however, a major feud developed between Ahidjo and Biya. On July 19, 1983, Ahidjo went into exile in [[France]], and Biya began removing Ahidjo's supporters from positions of power and eliminating symbols of his authority, removing official photographs of Ahidjo from the public as well as removing Ahidjo's name from the anthem of the CNU.&lt;ref name="KT"&gt;Milton H. Krieger and Joseph Takougang, ''African State and Society in the 1990s: Cameroon's Political Crossroads'' (2000), Westview Press, pages 65&amp;#x2013;73.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; On August 22, Biya announced that a plot allegedly involving Ahidjo had been uncovered. For his part, Ahidjo severely criticized Biya, alleging that Biya was abusing his power, that he lived in fear of plots against him, and that he was a threat to national unity. The two were unable to reconcile despite the efforts of several foreign leaders, and Ahidjo announced on August 27 that he was resigning as head of the CNU.&lt;ref name=KT/&gt; In exile, Ahidjo was sentenced to death ''[[trial in absentia|in absentia]]'' in February 1984, along with two others, for participation in the June 1983 coup plot, although Biya commuted the sentence to life in prison. Ahidjo denied involvement in the plot. A [[1984 Cameroonian coup attempt|violent but unsuccessful coup attempt in April 1984]] was also widely believed to have been orchestrated by Ahidjo.&lt;ref name=WP&gt;Jonathan C. Randal, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/07/19/AR2006071901340_pf.html "Tales of Ex-Leader's Role In Revolt Stun Cameroon"], ''The Washington Post'', April 15, 1984, page A01.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his remaining years, Ahidjo divided his time between France and [[Senegal]]. He died of a heart attack &lt;ref&gt;Glenn Fowler, [https://www.nytimes.com/1989/12/02/obituaries/ahmadou-ahidjo-of-cameroon-dies-ex-leader-was-65.html "Ahmadou Ahidjo Of Cameroon Dies; Ex-Leader Was 65"], The New York Times, 2 November 1989&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Dakar]] on 30 November 1989 and was buried there.&lt;ref name=Ten&gt;[http://www.gaboneco.com/show_article.php?IDActu=13988 "Cameroun : Ahidjo rentrera au pays en 2010"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090702015200/http://www.gaboneco.com/show_article.php?IDActu=13988 |date=2009-07-02 }}, GabonEco, 29 June 2009 {{fr icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He was officially rehabilitated by a law in December 1991.&lt;ref&gt;Mamadou Diouf, [https://books.google.com/books?id=tAywnB3pQI0C&amp;pg=PA84&amp;dq=ahidjo+rehabilitated+1991&amp;ei=eMhMStrSApjeyASE4uTYDw ''Les figures du politique en Afrique''] (1999), page 84 {{fr icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Biya said on 30 October 2007 that the matter of returning Ahidjo's remains to Cameroon was "a family affair". An agreement on returning Ahidjo's remains was reached in June 2009, and it was expected that they would be returned in 2010.&lt;ref name=Ten/&gt;

'''Anna Kéthly'''  (16 November 1889 –  7 September 1976) was a [[Hungarian people|Hungarian]] [[social democracy|social democratic]] politician. Her fellow party member [[Vilmos Böhm]] called her the "Joan of Arc of Hungarian politics".

{{Social democracy sidebar |expanded=People}}

==Early career==
She was one of nine children born into a poor family in [[Budapest]], [[Hungary]]. At the age of fifteen she started working in a garment factory but soon found more appealing work in the editorial office of a women's magazine and this gave her the chance to further her education. In 1917, she joined the [[Hungarian Social Democratic Party]] and became an active Party member. In 1919, Kéthly was elected onto a committee of the Party. In subsequent years she was a frequent contributor to the Party's newspaper ''[[Népszava]]''. In 1922 Kéthly was elected to Parliament as a member of the Social Democratic Party, and represented her Party in parliament without a break until the [[Operation Margarethe|German invasion of Hungary]] in March 1944. After the German invasion, Kéthly left Budapest and lived in the country with false papers under an assumed identity. 

After the [[Second World War]], Kéthly again became politically active and helped to reorganize the Hungarian Social Democratic Party and she was elected to the Party's Political Committee. In April 1945, she was elected a member of the Provisional National Assembly and in the [[Hungarian parliamentary election, 1945|general elections in November of same year]], she was re-elected to parliament, this time as head of the Social Democratic faction, and was made Deputy Speaker of Parliament. Kéthly made frequent contributions of articles to Socialist papers and was active in maintaining contact with international socialist Parties in the West. In post-war Hungary, she was a leading opponent of her Party's merger with the [[Hungarian Communist Party]] and in the internal power-struggle that ensued, in March 1948, she was dismissed from the Party and soon after she also lost her seat in Parliament and placed under house arrest for two years.
 
==Arrest==
In June 1950, Kéthly, together with several other members of the Social Democratic Party, was arrested by the Communists, who had in the meantime gained control of Hungary. In January 1954, after more than three years in prison, she was charged with spying and activities directed against the state and sentenced to life imprisonment. Following international pressure from Western socialist parties she was granted a pardon and released, but kept under permanent 'observation'.

==Role in the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 and life in exile==
On 31 October 1956, following the revival of the Hungarian Social Democratic Party during the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Revolution]], she became president of the Party. On 1 November she attended the Socialist International Meeting in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]]. The following day, 2 November The Hungarian Government appointed her a delegate to the [[United Nations General Assembly]]. On 3 November her Party nominated Kéthly for a ministerial position in the new coalition government of [[Imre Nagy]] but at dawn the following day, 4 November 1956, the Soviet Union invaded Hungary and she was advised to fly to [[New York City]] and appeal to the U.N. General Assembly on behalf of Hungary. Eventually she settled in [[London]], [[United Kingdom]], where she carried on writing and editing Socialist publications. In 1962 the Hungarian Supreme Court reviewed Kéthly's 1954 pardon and, [[trial in absentia|''in absentia'']], imposed on her a three-year prison sentence for anti-state activities. 

Anna Kéthly died on 7 September 1976, in [[Blankenberge]], [[Belgium]].

In October, 1990, her ashes were returned to Hungary and laid to rest. A full rehabilitation of Anna Kéthly took place on 7 July 1994, when the Hungarian Supreme Court annulled the 1962 verdict against her.

==Movie==

'''Augustin Bizimungu''' (born 28 August 1952) is a former general in the [[Rwandan Armed Forces]] (FAR). In 1994, he briefly served as chief of staff of the army. During this time, he trained the soldiers and militiamen who carried out the [[Rwandan Genocide]].&lt;ref name=ictr-pressrelease&gt;{{cite news|url=http://unictr.unmict.org/en/news/augustin-bizimungu-transferred-arusha|title=ICTR press release about Bizimungu|publisher=ICTR|date=15 August 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Bizimungu was born in Byumba préfecture, Mukaranje Commune, Mugina Secteur, Nyange Cellule, [[Rwanda]].&lt;ref name="ictr-indictment"/&gt;

An ethnic [[Hutu]], Bizimungu held the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel in the FAR on 6 April 1994. Some days later, in the wake of [[Déogratias Nsabimana]]'s death alongside [[Juvénal Habyarimana]], Bizimungu was promoted to Major-General and appointed as chief of staff of the armed forces, replacing [[Marcel Gatsinzi]].&lt;ref name=dallaire&gt;{{cite book

Upon fleeing the country following the RPF (Rwandan Patriotic Front) victory, he reportedly declared that "The RPF will rule over a desert."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/2195666.stm

On 12 April 2002, the [[International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda]] (ICTR) issued an arrest warrant for Bizimungu, who was apparently working with the [[Angola]]n rebel movement [[UNITA]]. In August 2002, he was arrested by the Angolan government and taken to the U.N. [[War crime|War Crimes]] Tribunal in [[Tanzania]].&lt;ref name=globeandmail20020815a&gt;{{cite news

'''Bobby Lounge''' (born '''Dub Brock''', 1950) is an American singer-songwriter from [[McComb, Mississippi]], United States.

In the 1980s, Lounge played a handful of shows at Ruby's Roadhouse in [[Mandeville, Louisiana]]. He stopped playing professionally for many years while he battled [[Chronic Fatigue Syndrome]].&lt;ref name="Gundersen"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/music/news/2009-04-27-bobby-lounge_N.htm|title=A love song for Bobby Lounge, a N'awlins original|last=Gundersen|first=Edna|date=28 April 2009|work=[[USA Today]]|accessdate=26 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He launched a comeback from a short lived career when he appeared on stage at the 2005 [[New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival]], [[Tipitina's]], and the New Orleans [[House of Blues]].  That performance was enthusiastically received and subsequently glowing reviews appeared in ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[Living Blues]]'', ''Blues Review'', ''[[Down Beat]]'', ''[[USA Today]]'' and other magazines and newspapers.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="36072">This is a simplified '''family tree of the House of Bourbon'''. The [[House of Bourbon]] is a cadet branch of the Capetian dynasty that descended from a younger son of King [[Louis IX of France]]. Louis IX's grandson was the first duke of Bourbon, whose descendants would later become Kings of France in accordance to the [[Salic law]]. In the present day, family representatives are the King of [[Spain]] and the Grand Duke of [[Luxembourg]]. Several others are pretenders to the thrones of France, Two Sicilies, and Brazil.

'''Carlos Peña Romulo''', {{post-nominals|list=[[Quezon Service Cross|QSC]], [[Philippine Legion of Honor|CLH]], [[National Artist of the Philippines|NA]]}} (14 January 1898 – 15 December 1985) was a [[Filipino people|Filipino]] diplomat, statesman, soldier, journalist and author. He was a reporter at 16, a newspaper editor by the age of 20, and a publisher at 32. He was a co-founder of the [[Boy Scouts of the Philippines]], a general in the US Army and the Philippine Army, university president, President of the UN General Assembly, was eventually named one of the Philippines' [[National Artist of the Philippines|National Artists]] in Literature, and was the recipient of many other honors and honorary degrees. His hometown is [[Camiling, Tarlac]] and he studied at the Camiling Central Elementary School during his basic education.

==Diplomatic career==
Romulo served eight Philippine presidents, from [[Manuel L. Quezon]] to [[Ferdinand Marcos]], as the  [[Department of Foreign Affairs (Philippines)|Secretary of Foreign Affairs]] of the [[Philippines]] and as the country's representative to the [[United States]] and to the [[United Nations]]. He also served as the [[Resident Commissioners from the Philippines|Resident Commissioner to the U.S. House of Representatives]] during the Commonwealth era. In addition, he served also as the [[Department of Education (Philippines)|Secretary of Education]] in President [[Diosdado P. Macapagal]]'s and President [[Ferdinand E. Marcos]]'s Cabinet through 1962 to 1968.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.uprotc.org/alumni/general-carlos-romulo.html# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-10-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110919025943/http://www.uprotc.org/alumni/general-carlos-romulo.html# |archive-date=2011-09-19 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://carlospromulo.org/bio/curriculum-vitae/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Resident Commissioner===
Romulo served as [[United States Congressional Delegations from Philippines|Resident Commissioner of the Philippines]] to the [[United States Congress]] from 1944 to 1946. This was the title of the non-voting Delegate to the US House of Representatives for lands taken in the [[Spanish–American War]], and as such, he is the only member of the US Congress to end his tenure via a legal secession from the Union.

===United Nations===
In his career in the United Nations, Romulo was a strong advocate of human rights, freedom and decolonization. In 1948 in Paris, France, at the third UN General Assembly, he strongly disagreed with a proposal made by the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] delegation headed by [[Andrei Vishinsky]], who challenged his credentials by insulting him with this quote: "You are just a little man from a little country." In return, Romulo replied, "It is the duty of the little Davids of this world to fling the pebbles of truth in the eyes of the blustering Goliaths and force them to behave!", leaving Vishinsky with nothing left to do but sit down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Metin |first1=Aris |title=What is the Filipino Leader? |url=http://www.edistaffbuilders.com/EDIZine/2014/April/fil_lead.html |website=EDIzine: EDI-Staffbuilder's Official Online Newsletter |accessdate=22 January 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160129062753/http://www.edistaffbuilders.com/EDIZine/2014/April/fil_lead.html |archivedate=29 January 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====President of the UN General Assembly====
He served as the [[President of the United Nations General Assembly|President]] of the Fourth Session of [[United Nations General Assembly]] from 1949 to 1950—the first Asian to hold the position—and served as president of the [[United Nations Security Council]] four times, twice in 1957, 1980 and 1981.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unmultimedia.org/oralhistory/category/charter-review/ ''Dag Hammarskjöld Library'']. Retrieved 7 September 2013&lt;/ref&gt; He had served with General [[Douglas MacArthur]] in the [[Pacific]], and became the first non-American to win the [[Pulitzer Prize]] in Correspondence in 1942. The Pulitzer Prize website says Carlos P. Romulo of Philippine Herald was awarded "For his observations and forecasts of Far Eastern developments during a tour of the trouble centers from Hong Kong to Batavia."

====Campaign for Secretary-General====

{{See also|United Nations Secretary-General selection, 1953}}

Romulo ran for the office of [[United Nations Secretary-General]] in the [[United Nations Secretary-General selection, 1953|1953 selection]]. He fell two votes short of the required 7-vote majority in the Security Council, finishing second to [[Lester B. Pearson]] of Canada. His ambitions were further dashed by negative votes from France and the Soviet Union, both of whom were [[Permanent members of the United Nations Security Council|permanent members]] with veto power.&lt;ref name="nytimes19530313"&gt;{{cite news | last1=Hamilton | first1=Thomas J. | title=Soviet Veto Blocks Pearson U.N. Boom; Romulo Also Fails | work=The New York Times | page= | date=13 March 1953}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Security Council eventually settled on a [[dark horse]] candidate and selected [[Dag Hammarskjöld]] as Secretary-General of the United Nations.

===Ambassador to the United States===
From Jan 1952 to May 1953, Romulo became only the second former member of Congress to become the Ambassador to the United States from a foreign country, following [[Joaquin M. Elizalde]], who had been his immediate predecessor in both posts. He later served as Ambassador again from Sept 1955 to Feb 1962.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.philippineembassy-usa.org/philippines-dc/embassy-dc/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philippine Presidential Aspiration===
Instead, he returned to the Philippines and was a candidate for the nomination as the presidential candidate for the [[Liberal Party (Philippines)|Liberal Party]], but lost at the party convention to the incumbent [[Elpidio Quirino]], who ran unsuccessfully for re-election against [[Ramon Magsaysay]]. Quirino had agreed to a secret ballot at the convention, but after the convention opened, the president demanded an open roll-call voting, leaving the delegates no choice but supporting Quirino, the candidate of the party machine. Feeling betrayed, Romulo left the Liberal Party and became national campaign manager of Magsaysay, the candidate of the opposing [[Nacionalista Party (Philippines)|Nacionalista Party]] who won the [[Philippine general election, 1953|election]].

===Minister of Foreign Affairs===
He was the signatory for the Philippines to the United Nations Charter when it was founded in 1945. He was the Philippines' Secretary (Minister from 1973 to 1984) of Foreign Affairs under President [[Elpidio Quirino]] from 1950 to 1952, under President Diosdado Macapagal from 1963 to 1964 and under President Ferdinand Marcos from 1968 to 1984. In April 1955 he led the Philippines' delegation to the [[Asian-African Conference]] at [[Bandung]].

===Resignation from the Marcos Cabinet===
Romulo supported President [[Ferdinand Marcos]] through most of his presidency. But he resigned soon after the assassination of [[Benigno Aquino Jr.|Benigno Aquino]], citing poor health.  Gregorio Brillantes interviewed him in 1984, and he said he resigned "heartsick" because of the assassination of Aquino, whom he considered a "friend", and the resulting freefall of the Philippines' economy and international reputation.&lt;ref&gt;Brillantes, Gregorio. The Twilight of the General. National Midweek Vol. 1 No. 9. January 1, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Published books==
Romulo, in all, wrote and published 22 books, which includes ''The United'' (novel), ''I Walked with Heroes'' (autobiography), ''I Saw the Fall of the Philippines'', ''Mother America'' and ''I See the Philippines Rise'' (war-time memoirs).

==Death==
He died, at 87, in Manila on 15 December 1985 and was buried in the Heroes' Cemetery ([[Libingan ng mga Bayani]]). He was honored as "one of the truly great statesmen of the 20th century."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/12/16/world/carlos-p-romulo-of-philippines-dies.html?pagewanted=all|title=CARLOS P.

==Anecdotes from Beth Romulo through ''Reader's Digest'' (June 1989)==
At the third UN General Assembly, held in [[Paris]] in 1948, the [[USSR]]'s deputy foreign minister, [[Andrei Vishinsky]], sneered at Romulo and challenged his credentials: "You are just a little man from a little country." "It is the duty of the little Davids of this world," cried Romulo, "to fling the pebbles of truth in the eyes of the blustering Goliaths and force them to behave!"

During his meeting with [[Josip Broz Tito]] of [[Yugoslavia]], Marshal Tito welcomed Gen. Romulo with drinks and cigars, to which the general kindly refused. Their conversation went as follows:

{{quote|Tito: "Do you drink?"

Romulo: "No, I don't."

Tito: "Do you smoke?"

Romulo: "No, thank you."

Tito: "What do you do then?"

Romulo: "I etcetera."}}

At this, Marshal Tito was tickled by his reply and loudly exclaimed around the room, "I etcetera, etcetera, etcetera!"

Romulo was a dapper little man (barely five feet four inches in shoes). When they waded in at Leyte beach in October 1944, and the word went out that [[General MacArthur]] was waist deep, one of Romulo's journalist friends cabled, "If MacArthur was in water waist deep, Romulo must have drowned!"

In later years, Romulo told another story himself about a meeting with MacArthur and other tall American generals who disparaged his physical stature. "Gentlemen," he declared, "When you say something like that, you make me feel like a dime among nickels."

[[Image:Memorial of Murato on Pelister.JPG|300px|thumb|right|Memorial of Dimitar Ilievski - Murato on [[Pelister]] near the dormitory "Kopanki".]]

'''Dimitar Ilievski - Murato''' ({{lang-mk|Димитар Илиевски - Мурато}}) (1953 in [[Bitola]] &amp;ndash; May 10, 1989 in [[Mount Everest]]) was an alpinist from the [[Republic of Macedonia]] representing [[SFR Yugoslavia]], the first [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonian]] ever to climb the highest peak of the world, [[Mount Everest]]. He died on the descent of Mt. Everest.

Murato, as he was known in his native town [[Bitola]], reached the top of [[Mount Everest]] on May 10, 1989 as part of a larger [[SFR Yugoslavia|Yugoslavian]] expedition, of which only few alpinists succeeded to reach the peak. He is noted as the 264th summiter of [[Mount Everest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.everesthistory.com/everestsummits/summits89.htm|title=List of climbers who conquered Mount Everest in 1989|publisher=EverestHistory|accessdate=2008-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After reaching the summit, he put the flags of both former [[SFR Yugoslavia]] and [[SR Macedonia]].

In his honour, a traditional memorial march to [[Pelister]] named after him is organized every year around the date of his biggest achievement and tragedy.

'''Eva de la Caridad Méndez''' (born March 5, 1974),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2786904/Their-little-princess-Eva-Mendes-Ryan-Gosling-baby-daughter-Disney-inspired-name.html|title=Their little princess! Eva Mendes and Ryan Gosling give baby daughter a Disney inspired name|website=[[Daily Mail]]|date=October 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; known professionally as '''Eva Mendes''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|ɛ|n|d|ɛ|z}}), is an American actress, model and businesswoman. Her acting career began in the late 1990s, with a series of roles in B films such as ''[[Children of the Corn V: Fields of Terror]]'' (1998) and ''[[Urban Legends: Final Cut]]'' (2000).

Mendes's performance in ''[[Training Day]]'' (2001) marked a turning point in her career, and led to parts in the commercially successful films ''[[2 Fast 2 Furious]]'' (2003) and ''[[Hitch (film)|Hitch]]'' (2005), the latter of which made her one of the first minority actors to play the lead in a mainstream romantic comedy. She starred in ''[[Ghost Rider (2007 film)|Ghost Rider]]'' (2007) and ''[[The Spirit (film)|The Spirit]]'' (2008), both film adaptations of comics, and ventured into more dramatic territory with ''[[We Own the Night (film)|We Own the Night]]'' (2007), ''[[The Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call New Orleans|Bad Lieutenant]]'' (2009), ''[[Last Night (2010 film)|Last Night]]'' (2010), and ''[[The Place Beyond the Pines]]'' (2012). Her other films include ''[[Out of Time (2003 film)|Out of Time]]'' (2003), ''[[The Women (2008 film)|The Women]]'' (2008), ''[[The Other Guys]]'' (2010), and ''[[Girl in Progress]]'' (2012).

Mendes has appeared in several music videos for artists like [[Will Smith]], and has also been an ambassador for brands, including [[Calvin Klein]], [[Cartier S.A.|Cartier]], [[Reebok]], [[Pantene]] shampoo, [[Morgan (clothing)|Morgan]], and [[Peek &amp; Cloppenburg]]. She has designed for [[New York &amp; Company]] and is the creative director of CIRCA Beauty, a makeup line sold at [[Walgreens]].

==Early life==
Mendes was born in [[Miami]], [[Florida]], to [[Cubans|Cuban]] parents Eva Pérez Suárez and Juan Carlos Méndez, and raised by her mother in the [[Los Angeles]] suburb of [[Glendale, California|Glendale]] after her parents' divorce. Mendes was raised a Roman Catholic and at one time even considered becoming a [[Roman Catholic|Catholic]] [[nun]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/film/viva-eva--one-gutsy-cool-chick/2007/02/18/1171733603175.html|title=Viva Eva – one gutsy, cool gal|website=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|first=Sal|last=Morgan|date=February 19, 2007|accessdate=February 18, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her mother worked at [[TCL Chinese Theatre|Mann's Chinese Theatre]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.violetgrey.com/violet-files/cover-story/eva-mendes-on-beauty|title=EVA MENDES|website=Violet Grey|date=November 2014|first=Evelyn|last=Crowley|accessdate=November 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later for an aerospace company, and her father ran a meat distribution business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/film/latina-bonita/2008/02/17/1203190640058.html|title=Latina Bonita|website=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|first=Helen|last=Barlow|date=February 18, 2008|accessdate=May 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mendes had one older brother, Juan Carlos Méndez, Jr. (1963–2016), who died from throat cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etonline.com/news/187683_eva_mendes_brother_dead_at_53/|title=Eva Mendes and Family Remember 'Amazing' Brother Juan Carlos After He Dies of Throat Cancer at 53|website=[[Entertainment Tonight]]|first=John|last=Boone|date=April 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also has an older sister, Janet, and a younger paternal half-brother, Carlos Alberto "Carlo" Méndez.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2585861/Eva-Mendes-brings-personal-cheer-squad-celebrates-launch-New-York-Company-spring-line.html|title=Three generations!

==Acting career==
===Beginnings and breakthrough (1998–2001)===
Mendes began her acting career after a talent manager saw her photo in a friend's portfolio.&lt;ref name="People Bio"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.people.com/people/eva_mendes/biography/0,,20058805,00.html|title=Eva Mendes Biography|website=People|accessdate=March 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her first film role was that of one in a group teenagers who become lost in middle America in the direct-to-video horror film ''[[Children of the Corn V: Fields of Terror]]''. Mendes was disappointed in her performance and soon hired an acting coach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bahcecik.ipower.com/evamendes/interviews6.htm|title=Eva Mendes Interview: Hitch is a rising star|website=Bahcecik.ipower.com|accessdate=March 3, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120414052129/http://bahcecik.ipower.com/evamendes/interviews6.htm|archivedate=April 14, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She subsequently took on the roles of a bridesmaid in the comedy ''[[A Night at the Roxbury]]'' (1998), with [[Will Ferrell]] and [[Chris Kattan]], a housekeeper in the fantasy family film ''[[My Brother the Pig]]'' (1999), with [[Scarlett Johansson]], and that of an ill-fated film student in the slasher film ''[[Urban Legends: Final Cut]]'' (2000).

Mendes starred opposite [[Steven Seagal]] in the action thriller ''[[Exit Wounds]]'' (2001), which made over US$73 million worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=exitwounds.htm&lt;/ref&gt; According to Mendes, her voice was dubbed in the editing, with a producer telling her that she "didn’t sound intelligent enough".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/news/a12282/eva-mendes-voice-dubbed/&lt;/ref&gt; Her breakthrough though came later in 2001 with her performance as the mistress of a corrupt cop in [[Antoine Fuqua]]'s crime thriller ''[[Training Day]]'', alongside [[Denzel Washington]] and [[Ethan Hawke]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biography.com/people/eva-mendes-21056489|title=Eva Mendes|website=Biography.com|accessdate=December 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; She described her role as "privotal" in her career, stating that it motivated her to keep going as an actress, as she was "bored"  doing "terrible cheesy horrible" films before she obtained it.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cinemablend.com/new/Interview-Eva-Mendes-6615.html&lt;/ref&gt; ''Training Day'' was a box office hit, grossing US$104.5 million.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.the-numbers.com/movie/Training-Day#tab=summary&lt;/ref&gt;

===Worldwide exposure (2002–2009)===
Her role in ''Training Day'' led to larger film parts and Mendes soon established herself as a [[Hollywood]] actress. While her sole film release in 2002 was the crime comedy ''[[All About the Benjamins]]'', in which she played the girlfriend of a con artist, Mendes had roles on four studio feature films released throughout 2003. ''[[2 Fast 2 Furious]]'' teamed her with [[Paul Walker]] and [[Tyrese Gibson]], portraying a [[United States Customs Service]] agent working undercover for a notorious Argentine drug lord. The film gave Mendes a much wider exposure, grossing over US$236 million globally.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=2fast2furious.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The Western action film ''[[Once Upon a Time in Mexico]]'' saw her star with [[Antonio Banderas]] and [[Salma Hayek]], as the daughter of a Mexican drug lord. While reviews for the film were mixed, it made US$98.1 million.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=onceuponatimeinmexico.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Mendes reunited with Danzel Washington for the thriller ''[[Out of Time (2003 film)|Out of Time]]'', in which she played the soon-to-be ex-wife of a well-respected chief of police. The film was a moderate commercial success,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/out_of_time/&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Roger Ebert]], in his review for the film, described Mendes' role as a "curiously forgiving character, who feels little rancor for the straying [husband] and apparently still likes him; maybe there would have been more suspense if she were furious with him".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/out-of-time-2003&lt;/ref&gt; Her last 2003 film was the comedy ''[[Stuck on You (2003 film)|Stuck on You]]'', with [[Matt Damon]] and [[Greg Kinnear]], in which she played an aspiring actress. She starred with [[Will Smith]], as the love interest of a professional dating consultant, in her next film, ''[[Hitch (film)|Hitch]]'' (2005), making her one of the first minority actors to play the lead in a mainstream romantic comedy.&lt;ref name="People Bio"/&gt; ''USA Today'' described it as "her best screen role to date",&lt;ref&gt;https://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/movies/reviews/2005-02-10-hitch_x.htm&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Detroit Free Press'' remarked: "Smith and Mendes are terrific together. He brings her game up so high you'd think she has had as many good parts as Smith".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/hitch&lt;/ref&gt; ''Hitch'' was the highest-grossing comedy in North America until 2018, and made US$368.1 million in its global theatrical run.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=hitch.htm&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, Mendes also starred in the little-seen films ''[[The Wendell Baker Story]]'' and ''[[Guilty Hearts]]''.
[[File:Eva Mendes Venice09-3.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Mendes at the 66th Venice Film Festival]]
In the romantic comedy ''[[Trust the Man]]'' (2006), Mendes starred with [[David Duchovny]], [[Billy Crudup]], [[Julianne Moore]], and [[Maggie Gyllenhaal]], playing what ''The A.V. Club'' described as a "vapid sexpot".&lt;ref&gt;https://film.avclub.com/trust-the-man-1798201929&lt;/ref&gt; The much criticized ''[[Ghost Rider (film)|Ghost Rider]]'' (2007), based on the [[Ghost Rider (Johnny Blaze)|Marvel Comics character]], featured Mendes as the love interest of the titular character ([[Nicolas Cage]]). The film fared well commercially, opening atop at the North American box office, with earnings of more than US$45&amp;nbsp;million; it eventually made over US$228&amp;nbsp;million worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Ghost Rider| url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=main&amp;id=ghostrider.htm| publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]]| accessdate=20 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; She starred opposite [[Joaquin Phoenix]] and [[Mark Wahlberg]] in the thriller ''[[We Own the Night (film)|We Own the Night]]'' (also 2007), as the girlfriend of an [[NYPD]] captain. Critic [[Peter Travers]] found the film to be "defiantly, refreshingly unhip" and noted that "sizzle comes naturally" from Mendes.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/movie-reviews/we-own-the-night-249634/&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, she also starred in the films ''[[Live! (2007 film)|Live!]]'' and ''[[Cleaner (film)|Cleaner]]'', both of which went unnoticed by audiences, and made an uncredited cameo appearance in the comedy ''[[Knocked Up]]''.

In 2008, Mendes took on the role of a perfume salesgirl in Saks Fifth Avenue in the all-female comedy ''[[The Women (2008 film)|The Women]]'', opposite [[Meg Ryan]], [[Annette Bening]], [[Debra Messing]], and [[Jada Pinkett Smith]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.welt.de/english-news/article3070137/Golden-Raspberry-Awards-list-of-nominees.html|title=2009 Razzies: Golden Raspberry Awards list of nominees|website=[[Die Welt]]|date=January 22, 2009|accessdate=March 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though a commercial success, ''The Women'' was panned by critics, with Mendes earning a  nomination for the [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actress]] for her performance. She also played the ''[[femme fatale]]''  Sand Saref in 2008's ''[[The Spirit (film)|The Spirit]]'', based on the newspaper [[comic strip]] of [[Spirit (comics)|the same name]] by [[Will Eisner]]. It received lackluster reviews from critics, who deemed it melodramatic, unoriginal, and sexist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_spirit|title=The Spirit (2008)|publisher=Rotten Tomatoes|accessdate=August 8, 2009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090321173043/http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_spirit/|archivedate=March 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her only 2009 film release was the crime drama ''[[Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call New Orleans]]'', which reunited her with Nicolas Cage,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2008/film/markets-festivals/eva-mendes-eyes-bad-lieutenant-1117987505/|title=Eva Mendes eyes 'Bad Lieutenant'|website=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|first=Tatiana|last=Siegel|date=June 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; playing a prostitute, and again, his love interest. While the film found a limited audience in theaters, it garnered acclaim, appearing on many top ten lists of the year.&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20100810232736/http://blogs.suntimes.com/ebert/2009/12/the_best_films_of_2009.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recent roles and hiatus (2010s)===
Mendes reunited with previous collaborators [[Will Ferrell]] and Mark Wahlberg for the action comedy ''[[The Other Guys]]'' (2010), in which she portrayed the wife of a mild-mannered forensic NYPD accountant (Farrell).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.empireonline.com/movies/news/mendes-keaton-join-guys/|title=Mendes And Keaton Join The Other Guys|website=[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]|first=Chris|last=Hewitt|date=September 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was a commercial success, grossing US$170.4 million globally.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=ferrellwahlberg2010.htm&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, she also played the co-worker and the love interest of a committed man in [[Massy Tadjedin]]'s  romantic drama ''[[Last Night (2010 film)|Last Night]]'', alongside [[Keira Knightley]] and [[Sam Worthington]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalledger.com/ledgerpop/article_272633738.shtml|title=Eva Mendes Sex Tape, Funny or Die Night Vision Promo|website=National Ledger|first1=Daniela|last1=Elser|first2=Julie|last2=Pike|date=August 4, 2010|accessdate=August 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; While she was initially reluctant to star, worrying that the character would "lack originality" and was "too seductive", she agreed to play the role after meeting with Tadjedin; she said: "It was great to connect with a female director and talk about this woman and not objectify her as the other woman but give her a real true life and make her honest[...]. Thank God I did."&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.latimes.com/2011/may/07/entertainment/la-et-last-night-director-20110510&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cinemablend.com/new/Interview-Massy-Tadjedin-Directing-Keira-Knightley-Sam-Worthington-Last-Night-24678.html&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Eva Mendes TIFF 6, 2012.jpg|thumb|upright|Mendes at the 2012 [[Toronto International Film Festival|TIFF]] premiere of ''[[The Place Beyond the Pines]]'']]
In 2011, Mendes appeared in an uncredited cameo in ''[[Fast Five]]'', reprising her role from ''2 Fast 2 Furious''. In 2012, she starred in the dramedy ''[[Girl in Progress]]'', as a single mom raising her fourteen-year-old daughter, and in the art fantasy drama ''[[Holy Motors]]'', as Kay M, a role originally written for [[Kate Moss]]. While ''Girl in Progress'' earned Mendes an [[ALMA Award]] nomination for Favorite Movie Actress, she described ''Holy Motors'' as "the coolest, most creative thing I've ever done".&lt;ref name="telegraph.co.uk"&gt;https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/starsandstories/9855693/Eva-Mendes-interview-Im-an-anti-actress.html&lt;/ref&gt;  In ''[[The Place Beyond the Pines]]'' (also 2012), a generational drama directed by [[Derek Cianfrance]] and alongside [[Ryan Gosling]] and [[Bradley Cooper]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://collider.com/the-place-beyond-the-pines-release-date/203904 THE PLACE BEYOND THE PINES, Starring Ryan Gosling and Bradley Cooper, Set for Release on March 29, 2013 | Collider | Page 203904] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121019171109/http://collider.com/the-place-beyond-the-pines-release-date/203904/ |date=October 19, 2012}}. Collider.&lt;/ref&gt; Mendes portrayed the former lover of a motorcycle stuntman. The film was a moderate commercial success, and ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', in its review, described her performance as "quietly heartbreaking".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20483133_20657989,00.html|title=The Place Beyond the Pines|website=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|first=Chris|last=Nashawaty|date=April 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She also visited Sierra Leone and was featured in the PBS documentary ''[[Half the Sky: Turning Oppression into Opportunity for Women Worldwide]]'', which aired in October 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.torontosun.com/2011/10/24/mendes-visits-sierra-leone|title=Mendes visits Sierra Leone|website=[[Toronto Sun]]|date=October 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Mendes appeared in the [[HBO]] comedy film ''[[Clear History]]'', as a formerly heavy-set woman,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2012/09/larry-david-assembles-all-star-cast-for-hbo-movie-jon-hamm-kate-hudson-danny-mcbride-eva-mendes-amy-ryan-bill-hader-335715/|title=Larry David Assembles All-Star Cast For HBO Movie: Jon Hamm, Kate Hudson, Danny McBride, Eva Mendes, Amy Ryan, Bill Hader|website=Deadline Hollywood|first=Nellie|last=Andreeva|date=September 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2014, she starred as a cabaret show performer in Ryan Gosling's directorial debut ''[[Lost River (film)|Lost River]]'', which competed in the [[Un Certain Regard]] section at the [[Cannes Film Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2014/04/17/cannes-festival-to-premiere-films-by-jean-luc-godard-ryan-gosling/ |title=Cannes Festival to Premiere Films by Jean-Luc Godard, Ryan Gosling |work=The Wall Street Journal |date=April 17, 2014 |accessdate=April 17, 2014 |first=Erich |last=Schwartzel |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140418221958/https://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2014/04/17/cannes-festival-to-premiere-films-by-jean-luc-godard-ryan-gosling/ |archivedate=April 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Creepy, Uncle.

Mendes' public image is strongly tied to her perceived beauty and sex appeal. Many media outlets have cited her as one of the world's most beautiful Latin women, and she has been often considered a [[sex symbol]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/sexy-eva-mendes-says-shes-more-than-a-pretty-face&lt;/ref&gt; She once embraced that status, saying it was "partially self-created [...] I think at times I play up my sexiness. And there's times where I don't",&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nbcnewyork.com/blogs/niteside/Eva-Mendes-on-Being-Dubbed-a-Sex-Symbol-Im-Cool-With-It---120678559.html&lt;/ref&gt; though she does not let it to interfere with her film work: "I like it when it doesn't limit my career. It's a part of my life, but on a secondary plane".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.europapress.es/chance/gente/noticia-eva-mendes-estoy-orgullosa-ser-sex-symbol-20100614175351.html&lt;/ref&gt; Her professional trajectory throughout the 2000s, nevertheless, tended to gravitate towards parts that relied heavily on her looks.&lt;ref name="telegraph.co.uk"/&gt;

Mendes ranked 54th, 12th, 7th, 7th, and 11th in ''[[Maxim (magazine)|Maxim]]'' magazine's Hot 100 issue in 2002, 2005, 2007, 2008, and 2010 respectively,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://maxim.com/Girls/Evamendes/slideshow/1131/47.aspx?|title=Hot 100|website=[[Maxim (magazine)|Maxim]]|year=2006|accessdate=January 11, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maxim.com/girls/articles/90539/2010-hot-100.html |title=2010 Hot 100 |language=German |website=Maxim |accessdate=August 16, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100813180816/http://www.maxim.com/girls/articles/90539/2010-hot-100.html |archivedate=August 13, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and appeared several times on the cover.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maximonline.com/Evamendesnovember2007photo2/girls_of_maxim/7307/75.aspx? |title=November Issue Preview |website=Maxim |date=November 2007 |accessdate=October 13, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071123191546/http://www.maximonline.com/Evamendesnovember2007photo2/girls_of_maxim/7307/75.aspx? |archivedate=November 23, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; She also ranked 80th, 23rd and 44th in ''[[FHM]]'' magazine's "100 Sexiest Women in the World" supplement in 2004, 2005, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0578949/bio?&lt;/ref&gt; She was voted number four in the 2008 edition, and number one in the 2009 edition, of [[AskMen.com]]'s Top 99 Most Desirable Women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.askmen.com/specials/2009_top_99/eva-mendes-1.html|title=Eva Mendes Top 99 Women 2009|website=AskMen.com|accessdate=August 16, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110102132949/http://www.askmen.com/specials/2009_top_99/eva-mendes-1.html|archivedate=January 2, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[People (magazine)|People]]'' also named her one of 2012's Most Beautiful at Every Age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2012 Most Beautiful at Every Age – Eva Mendes|url=http://www.people.com/people/package/gallery/0,,20360857_20360861,00.html#20612434|website=People|first=Karen J.|last=Quan|date=April 20, 2012|accessdate=April 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1936">'''Francis Fuller the younger''' (1670–1706), was an [[English people|English]] [[Medical writing|medical writer]].

Fuller was the second son of [[Francis Fuller the Elder|Francis Fuller]], nonconformist divine, and his wife Bridget. He was born at [[Bristol]], and entered at [[St. John's College, Cambridge]], in 1687. He graduated B.A. at [[Cambridge University|Cambridge]] in 1691, and M.A. in 1704.&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=FLR687F|name=Fuller, Francis}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had severe [[hypochondriasis]] following his too vigorous external treatment of an attack of [[itch]]. The hypochondriasis was accompanied by [[dyspepsia]], and he cured himself by exercise on horseback and by [[emetic]]s. This led him to write a book on the use of exercise in the treatment of disease, called ''Medicina Gymnastica, or a Treatise concerning the power of Exercise with respect to the Animal Œconomy, and the great necessity of it in the Cure of several Distempers'', 1704. A second edition was published in the same year, a third in 1707, a fifth in 1718, a sixth in 1728, and a ninth and last in 1777. Sydenham had been an advocate for fresh air and exercise as remedies in [[Tuberculosis|consumption]] and hypochondriasis, and Fuller enlarges upon his suggestions. He shows but little knowledge of disease; he thought highly of [[millipede]]s in the treatment of [[rheumatism]], and of [[liquorice]] in that of consumption, but has the merit of recommending the regular use of chafing, or, as it is now called, [[massage]], where exercise by locomotion is impossible. He died in June 1706.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3825">'''François-Nicolas Vincent''' (born 1766 or 1767; died March 24, 1794) was the Secretary General of the War Ministry in the [[First French Republic]], and a significant figure in the [[French Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=f5JfQgAACAAJ&amp;dq=The%20Oxford%20History%20of%20the%20French%20Revolution&amp;source=gbs_book_other_versions ''The Oxford History of the French Revolution'']; William Doyle; Clarendon Press, 1989; p.267. |"...Vincent, secretary general of the war ministry...."&lt;/ref&gt; A member of the [[Cordelier]] Club, he is best known as a radical [[sans-culottes]] leader and prominent member of the [[Hébertists|Hébertist faction]].

==Leadership==
The son of a prison concierge and a native [[Paris]]ian, Vincent worked as a lawyer's clerk and is believed to have lived in substantial poverty until 1792, at which point he became an active participant in the radical Revolutionary effort. The youngest of the men to follow [[Jacques Hébert]], Vincent, along with fellow Hébertist [[Charles-Philippe Ronsin]], took the Revolution to the country, becoming revolutionaries-on-a-mission. Upon his return to Paris, Vincent became more active in the [[Cordelier]] Club and was soon elected Orator. After this advancement, Vincent was eventually made General Secretary of the War Ministry under [[Jean Baptiste Noël Bouchotte]]. It is this job that allowed Vincent to bring more power to the sans-culottes.

==Downfall==
Jacques Hébert, writer and publisher of the ''La Pere Duchesne'', led Vincent, among others, on a campaign against what they deemed the soft 'moderation' of the [[Committee of Public Safety]], along with attempts to aid in the 'de-Christianization' of [[France]]. Vincent supported the overthrow of [[Maximilien Robespierre]] and when he and his fellow Hébertists became active enough in their opposition, Robespierre reacted with an arrest and trial for 'treasonous activity'. The Hébertists, along with some of their close friends and companions, were charged with attempting to overthrow the Committee of Public Safety to ensure the re-establishment of the [[monarchy]] and conspiring with foreigners to take down the Republic. No physical evidence was given to support these allegations but, even so, Vincent and his fellow Hébertists were found guilty and sentenced to death. On March 24, 1794, at the age of twenty-seven, François-Nicolas Vincent was beheaded at the [[guillotine]] along with Hébert, Ronsin, [[Antoine-François Momoro|Momoro]], and the other leaders of the Hébertist faction.&lt;ref&gt;Doyle, 1989; p.270. |"The trial took place on 21–4 March, its result a foregone conclusion. Among those who went to the scaffold with Pere Duchesne on the afternoon of the twenty-fourth were Vincent, Ronsin, and the leader of section Marat, Momoro."&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gennadiy Nikolayevich Nikonov''' ({{lang-ru|Геннадий Николаевич Никонов}}; August 11, 1950 - May 14, 2003) was a [[Russia]]n gun engineer.  His most famous accomplishments were probably as the designer of the [[AN-94]] [[assault rifle]], and the "straight-back bolt."  Nikonov held 44 Copyright Certificates,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.peoples.ru/military/design/nickonov/&lt;/ref&gt; and was awarded the titles of "The Best Designer of the Company" and "The Best Designer of the Ministry." &lt;ref&gt;http://alibudm.narod.ru/pis/pisuch.html&lt;/ref&gt; In memory of the outstanding designer, a memorial plaque on the building design and weapons center of "Izhmash" (2003), and at the place of his burial (2007).&lt;ref&gt;http://alibudm.narod.ru/pis/pisuch.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life and education ==

Nikonov was born in [[Izhevsk]]. His father and mother were employed at [[Izhmash]], a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] arms factory.  His father was a mechanic. Nikonov graduated from technical school in 1968 .  At Izhmash, he took evening classes.  In 1975  he graduated from the [[Izhevsk Mechanical Institute]] certified as a gun engineer.

== Design career ==

He started work at Izhmash in the Department of the Chief Arms Designer.  His first position was as a technician. In technical school, Nikonov became obsessed with underwater rifles. He won his first professional recognition by designing a trigger mechanism for an underwater rifle.

He designed various rifles, including [[air gun]]s and sporting firearms. One of the most praised was the stylish, accurate "Izjubr" (Buck Deer) carbine - a limited edition luxury weapon. Nikonov was appointed as a senior project engineer to design single-shot bolt action rifles and fully automatic weapons. In this assignment he patented a number of mechanisms and components. One of the most significant was the "straight-pull bolt," first used in a winter [[biathlon]] target [[rifle]].

Nikonov also worked on research projects. In the middle 1970s he entered a post-graduate Ph.D course. From 1980  to 1985  he worked on projects for the Soviet Ministry for Defense Industry.  Examples of his innovation include his [[Nikonov machine gun|twin-barreled machine gun]] and the "blow back shifted pulse (BBSP)" used on the AN-94. It is said that his high quality and quantity of work helped him advance to higher positions at work.

He was married with two sons, Nikolay and Yuri.  Tatiana, Nikonov's wife, works as an arms designer in the same bureau.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15627">'''George Feyer''' ([[Hungary]], 27 October 1908 – New York, 21 October 2001) was a classically trained [[pianist]] who turned to 'light' music upon graduating, and released a series of top-selling "Echoes of..." records on [[Vox Records]]. Feyer was born György Fejér, but westernised his name after leaving Europe. (''Feher'' means 'white' in Hungarian, and ''"Fejér'' is thus the equivalent of the antiquated spelling of the English name "Whyte".)

==Life==
===Early life and career in Europe===
Feyer remembered as a young boy hating his piano practice so much that his mother, a piano teacher, had to tie his legs to the piano stool.  He studied at the [[Franz Liszt Academy of Music]] in [[Budapest]] [alongside conductor Sir [[Georg Solti]]], and at the [[Budapest Conservatory of Music]].  Among his teachers were [[Ernő Dohnányi]], [[Zoltán Kodály]] and [[Béla Bartók]].  By this time he was developing an interest in light music and was playing in the evenings in many of the boîtes around Budapest, such as the Cafe Dunacorso where he accompanied [[Zsuzsa Darvas]], a popular [[diseuse]].

Feyer graduated, aged 23, in 1932 and caused a minor scandal by turning to [[pop music]] full-time.  It is ironic that he became a pianist after having been a student of composition and conducting, whereas his classmate Georg Solti, a piano prodigy, became one of the world's most acclaimed conductors.

One of Feyer's first jobs was accompanying [[silent films]], but he soon moved to night clubs, and it was not long before he and his drummer began working around Europe.  His first trip away from Budapest was in 1934, to [[Barcelona, Spain]].

For the next five years he toured Europe. In Paris a great fan was the exiled [[Edward VIII of the United Kingdom|Duke of Windsor]] (previously [[Edward VIII of the United Kingdom]], who had abdicated the throne of England in December 1936, and who lived in France from 1937 to 1939).  The Duke particularly liked the [[accordion]], so Feyer and his drummer drew straws to decide which of them would have to learn to play it.  The drummer lost, and Feyer was able to continue playing the piano.

In 1939 Feyer returned to Hungary to be with his family, but was moved to German factories in a forced labour brigade.  He was imprisoned in [[Bergen-Belsen concentration camp]] in the last year of the war, from where he was rescued in 1945 by the Allies.

Feyer returned to Budapest, and in late 1945 married Judith Hoffman, whom he had met during the war.  The couple had a son (Robert, b. Budapest, November 1946), and Feyer continued his musical career, playing in the Allied Officers' Club in Budapest (there was four-power nominal occupation in all the former [[Axis powers]], although in [[Eastern Europe]] the bulk of the troops were [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]).  After the establishment of Russian [[Stalinist]] [[Communist]] rule, Feyer fled to [[Switzerland]] in January 1948, where he had found a job playing at a resort hotel.  He persuaded the owners to allow him to bring his family.  At the time he played in a duo with a drummer, whose wife came too.

By the time the original contract was fulfilled, the [[Iron Curtain]] had truly dropped and Feyer and his drummer (also named George) decided not to return to Hungary, fearing persecution based on their contact with Western powers. They stayed in Switzerland, gaining popularity through successive jobs at the big hotels.  By 1950, when Hungary revolted, Switzerland would not allow them to become permanent residents on old Hungarian passports.

===Career in New York City===
Feyer’s younger brother Paul had left Europe before the war, and went to [[Venezuela]].  While there Paul won a [[lottery]], and used the money to come to [[New York City]], where he settled with the existing Hungarian community.  He quickly married a young woman from within that community, and thereby got permanent U.S. residency and later [[citizenship]].  Feyer's father had died during the war, probably of [[alcoholism]], and Paul had brought their mother to the U.S. in 1947.  Having two immediate family members in the U.S. helped George Feyer to obtain a [[visa (document)|visa]].  (Feyer's mother lived for another forty years in New York, dying at the age of 102, in 1987.)  The family arrived and settled in New York in January, 1951, changing the spelling of the name to Feyer almost immediately, as his brother Paul had done, to make it easier to pronounce, and to get work.  George's family became U.S. citizens in 1956 after the requisite five-year waiting period.  Feyer lived there for the rest of his life. (Feyer's drummer and his wife were also able to come to the United States, but they did not continue to work together in New York.)

Within a few months of arrival he made his New York debut at the famous Gogi's La Rue, in The Plush Room.  From 1951 to 1954 Feyer had a regular spot in [[Park Avenue (Manhattan)|Park Avenue]]'s [[Delmonico Hotel]] [now known as [[Trump Park Avenue]]].  It was during this period that Feyer began his recording career, making his first record [[Echoes of Paris]] in 1953. (Although Feyer made his recordings with light accompaniment, all his hotel and nightclub shows were solo.)

A handful more such records appeared in the next couple of years, and in 1955 Feyer signed a contract with New York's luxurious boutique hotel [[Carlyle Hotel|The Carlyle]] to appear in their [[Carlyle Hotel|Café Carlyle]].  He performed there for 13 years in a room specially set up for him, with decor provided by a Hungarian interior designer.  In August 1968, when he took his usual vacation on [[Nantucket]] Island, [[Bobby Short]] was hired to cover for him.  In Short's words, "He took off two weeks that summer, and Peter Sharp, who owns The Carlyle, asked [[Ahmet Ertegün|Ahmet]] and [[Nesuhi Ertegün]], of [[Atlantic Records]], who to get as a replacement.  They said, ‘Get Bobby Short.’  I did my best to make those two weeks as successful as anything I’d done, and when Feyer’s contract ran out they offered me half a year.  Feyer found a better deal elsewhere, and I work there now eight months of the year."  The management had changed, and the move turned out to be permanent. Short was to remain at The Carlyle for a fabled uninterrupted run until 2004, the year before his death.

Feyer joked that he had "taken the most expensive vacation of them all," and his son later said that he never set foot in The Carlyle again.  However he soon found work in the [[Stanhope Hotel]]'s Rembrandt Room.  Feyer remained there for 12 years, until 1980.  He spent his remaining two years of active performing at the Hideaway Room in the [[Waldorf-Astoria]], another famous hotel in New York.

Feyer retired in December 1982, after the death of his wife.  In 1985 he remarried the former Marta Kleyman (a cousin of his brother Paul's first wife), and continued to appear at private parties and occasional hotel engagements, mostly as favours to friends, particularly in [[Palm Springs, California]], where his second wife owned a home.  For many years, until no longer physically able to do so (in 1999), he played weekly at the [[Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center]], where he had been volunteering since 1961.

Feyer died just six days before his 93rd birthday, at [[Lenox Hill Hospital]] in [[Manhattan]]'s [[Upper East Side]].  He was survived by his son (who lives in [[San Francisco]]), three grandsons, and second wife (who died within the year after he died).

The Department of Music at [[Princeton University]] dedicated a "George and Judith Feyer Practice Room" to their memory on 2 June 2003.

==Recordings==

From 1953 to 1956, Feyer released a series of [[LP album|LPs]] on the [[Vox Records|VOX]] record label.  The records were all similarly entitled ''Echoes of ...''.  The first, ''Echoes of Paris'', was a huge hit, leading to 12 others.  The music consisted of popular songs and melodies, played by Feyer on the piano in his own inimitable arrangements, with light guitar and rhythm accompaniment.

In 1957 Feyer released his only two records with orchestra: one each of the songs of [[Cole Porter]] and [[Jerome Kern]]. From 1958 to 1959 Feyer recorded four albums for [[RCA Victor]], and in 1960 he recorded his first live album ''An Evening At The Café Carlyle'', for  [[Cadence Records]].

From the early 1960s onwards Feyer recorded a series of albums [including a second live album] for [[Decca Records|Decca]], who also reissued three of his VOX records.

In 1969 Feyer recorded an LP for [[Kapp Records]].  Sometime after 1970 he recorded his third live album, ''At The Stanhope'', which was available only from The Stanhope itself. Feyer's final three recordings were for [[Vanguard Records]]: ''The Essential [[George Gershwin]]'' (1974), ''The Essential [[Cole Porter]]'' (1976), and ''The Essential [[Jerome Kern]]'' (1978).  These three double-albums are the only of Feyer's recordings subsequently to have been officially issued on [[CD]].  However the issue of the Jerome Kern CD is missing the six tracks from the original LP which had contained an integral [[cello]] part throughout.  In addition, various other tracks on the original LP had contained briefer cello parts, and these sections of those tracks were also all cut from the CD issue.  The cello player was [[Evangeline Benedetti]], a cellist with the [[New York Philharmonic]] since 1967.  She has said that she knows nothing about why her parts were comprehensively edited out of the CD issue of the recording.

==In literature==

The 10-inch release of Feyer's first record, ''Echoes of Paris'', is mentioned in Chapter 5 of [[Ian Fleming]]'s fourth [[James Bond]] novel, ''[[Diamonds Are Forever (novel)|Diamonds Are Forever]]'' (published 1956). Tiffany calls it the “Best light record ever made.”

'''Henry Whitney Bellows''' (June 11, 1814 &amp;ndash; January 30, 1882) was an American clergyman, and the planner and president of the [[United States Sanitary Commission]], the leading soldiers' aid society, during the [[American Civil War]]. 
Under his leadership, the USSC became the major source of spiritual and physical aid for wounded [[Union army|Union]] soldiers.

==Life==
Bellows was born in [[Boston, Massachusetts]]. He graduated at [[Harvard College]] in 1832, and at the [[Harvard Divinity School]] in 1837, held a brief pastorate (1837&amp;ndash;1838) at [[Mobile, Alabama]], and in 1839 became pastor of the First Congregational (Unitarian) church in New York City (afterwards All Souls church), in charge of which he remained until his death.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=705}}

Here Bellows acquired a high reputation as a pulpit orator and lyceum lecturer, and was a recognized leader in the [[American Unitarian Association|Unitarian Church]] in America. For many years after 1846 he edited ''The Christian Inquirer'', a Unitarian weekly paper, and he was also for some time an editor of ''The Christian Examiner''. In 1849, he was elected into the [[National Academy of Design]] as an Honorary member. In 1857 he delivered a series of lectures in the [[Lowell Institute]] course, on The Treatment of Social Diseases.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=705}}

At the outbreak of the Civil War, he planned the [[United States Sanitary Commission]], of which he was the only president (1861 to 1878). He inspired the organization of chapters of the USSC in cities across the country, and the recruiting of thousands of volunteers to help Union soldiers. The organization raised millions of dollars for the war effort and to support soldiers and veterans.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=705}}

He was the first president of the first Civil Service Reform Association organized in the United States (1877), and was an organizer of the [[Union League Club of New York]] and of the [[Century Association]] in New York City. Together with his parishioner and friend, Peter Cooper, he established [[Cooper Union]], the design school that was free for students until the 21st century. In 1865 he proposed and organized the [[National Conference of Unitarian Churches|National Conference of Unitarian and other Christian churches]], and from 1865 to 1880 was chairman of its council.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=705}}

He died in New York City on 30 January 1882. A bronze memorial tablet by [[Augustus Saint-Gaudens]] was unveiled in All Souls church in 1886.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=705}}

==Works==

His published writings include:{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=705}}
*''Restatements of Christian Doctrine in Twenty-Five Sermons'' (1860)
*''Unconditioned Loyalty'' (1863), a strong pro-Union sermon, which was widely circulated during the Civil War

'''Hua Guofeng''' ({{IPAc-en|hw|ɑː}}; born '''Su Zhu'''; 16 February 1921 – 20 August 2008)&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=EWERAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=Hua+Guofeng+20+August+2008&amp;dq=Hua+Guofeng+20+August+2008&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwisk76fuoXWAhUIMZoKHUDSDoEQ6AEIMjAE Profile of Hua Guofeng]&lt;/ref&gt; was a Chinese politician who served as [[Chairman of the Communist Party of China]] and [[Premier of the People's Republic of China|Premier]] of the [[People's Republic of China]].  Hua held the top offices of the government, party, and the military after Premier [[Zhou Enlai |Zhou]] and Chairman [[Mao Zedong|Mao]]'s death, but was forced from power by more established party figures in 1978 and thereafter retreated from the political scene.

Originally from [[Shanxi]] province, Hua rose to power as a regional official in [[Hunan]] between 1949 and 1971, first serving as the prefecture [[Party Committee Secretary]] of the [[Xiangtan]], Mao's home area, then as the party secretary in the province during the latter stages of the [[Cultural Revolution]]. Hua was elevated to the national stage in early 1976, and was mainly known for his unswerving loyalty to Mao. After the death of [[Zhou Enlai]], Mao elevated Hua to the position of [[Premier of the State Council]], overseeing government work, and of [[Vice Chairman of the Communist Party of China|First Vice Chairman of the Communist Party]], which made him Mao's designated successor.

On 6 October 1976, shortly after the death of Mao, Hua removed the [[Gang of Four]] from political power by arranging for their arrests in Beijing. Afterwards he took on the titles of [[Chairman of the Communist Party of China|party chairman]] and [[Chairman of the Central Military Commission]]. Hua is thus far the only leader to have simultaneously held the offices of party leader, premier and CMC chairman.

Hua attempted moderate reforms and reversing some of the excesses of Cultural Revolution-era policies. However, because of his insistence on continuing the [[Maoist]] line and refusal to adopt large-scale reforms, he faced resistance in the upper echelons of the party. In December 1978, a group of party veterans led by [[Deng Xiaoping]], a pragmatic reformer, forced Hua from power but allowed him to retain some titles. Hua gradually faded into political obscurity, but continued to insist on the correctness of Maoist principles. He is remembered as a largely benign transitional figure in modern Chinese political history.

==Early life==
Born in [[Jiaocheng County]], [[Shanxi]] province, Hua joined the [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC) in 1938 as a part of counter-Japanese resistance, after having joined the [[Long March]] in 1936.&lt;ref name="palm"&gt;Palmowski, Jan: "Hua Guofeng" in ''A Dictionary of Contemporary World History''. [[Oxford University Press]], 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Like many Communists of the era who took on revolutionary names, he changed his name to '''Huá Guófēng''' as an abbreviation of "Zhōng'''huá''' kàngrì jiù'''guó''' xiān'''fēng''' duì" ({{lang|zh-hant|中華抗日救國先鋒隊}}, Chinese Anti-Japanese National Salvation Vanguard). After having served in the [[Eighth Route Army|8th Route Army]] during 12 years under General [[Zhu De]]'s command,&lt;ref name="palm" /&gt; he became propaganda chief for the county Party committee in 1947.

Hua moved with the PLA to [[Hunan]] in 1949, where he married Han Zhijun in January, and remained there as a local official until 1971. He was appointed Party secretary for [[Xiangyin County]] in August, just before the establishment of the People's Republic of China. In 1952, he was appointed secretary of Xiangtan Special District, which included Mao's hometown, [[Shaoshan]]. In this role, he built a memorial hall dedicated to Mao. When Mao visited the site, in June 1959, he was favorably impressed.&lt;ref name="Wang"&gt;Wang, James C.F., ''Contemporary Chinese Politics: An Introduction'' (Prentice-Hall, New Jersey: 1980), p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mao Zedong]] first met Hua in 1955, and apparently was impressed by his simplicity.{{clarify|date=June 2016}}

Hua participated in the 1959 [[Lushan Conference]] (an enlarged plenary session of the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of China|CPC Central Committee]]) as a member of the Hunan Provincial Party delegation, and wrote two investigative reports defending [[People's commune|communes]] and the [[Great Leap Forward]]. He denounced Defense Minister [[Peng Dehuai]] and other critics of the Great Leap, and argued that the death toll, said to number up to 30-40 million people, was exaggerated. Hua's sycophantic loyalty to Mao thus ensured his political future.

Hua's influence increased with the [[Cultural Revolution]], as he supported it and led the movement in Hunan. He organized the preparation for the establishment of the local [[Revolutionary Committee (PRC)|Revolutionary Committee]] in 1967, of which he was a deputy chairman, and gained wide attention for suppressing a hard-line extremist faction. In December 1970, he was elected new chairman of the Revolutionary Committee as well as first secretary of the CPC Hunan Committee.

He was elected a full member of the [[9th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China|9th Central Committee]] in 1969.

==Rise to power==
Hua was called to Beijing to direct [[Zhou Enlai]]'s State Council staff office in 1971, but only stayed for a few months before returning to his previous post in Hunan.&lt;ref name="Wang" /&gt; Later that year, he was appointed as the most junior of the seven-member committee investigating the [[Lin Biao]] Affair, a sign of the strong trust Mao had in him. Hua was re-elected to the [[10th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China|10th Central Committee]] in 1973 and elevated to membership in the [[Politburo of the Communist Party of China|Politburo]]; in the same year, he was put in charge by Zhou Enlai of agricultural development. He became minister of public security and vice-premier in 1975, but his duties were far broader, as he was also chosen to deliver a speech on modernizing agriculture in October of that year which echoed the views of Zhou Enlai.&lt;ref&gt;Wang, James C.F., ''Contemporary Chinese Politics: An Introduction'' (Prentice-Hall, New Jersey: 1980), p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

Zhou Enlai died on 8 January 1976, at a time when Deng Xiaoping's reformist alliance was not yet strong enough to stand up to both the ailing Mao Zedong and his Cultural Revolution allies, the [[Gang of Four]] ([[Jiang Qing]], Zhang Chunqiao, Wang Hongwen, and Yao Wenyuan). After reading the late premier's eulogy a week later, Deng left Beijing along with several close allies for the relative safety of Guangzhou.&lt;ref&gt;Hollingworth, Clare, ''Mao and the Men Against Him'' (Jonathan Cape, London: 1985), p. 291ff&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Mao Zedong had reportedly wanted to appoint Wang Hongwen as Zhou Enlai's successor, he ended up naming Hua as acting premier. At the same time, the leftist-controlled media began denouncing Deng once again (he had been purged during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and was only returned to power in 1973). Popular affection for Zhou was underestimated, however, leading to a confrontation between the radicals' militia allies and Beijing citizens seeking to honor Zhou during the traditional [[Qingming]] festival. At the same time, Hua delivered speeches on the "official line for criticizing Deng Xiaoping", which were approved by Mao and the Party Central Committee.

During the [[Tiananmen Incident]] of 1976, thousands of people protested at the militia's removal of wreaths honoring Zhou in front of the [[Monument to the People's Heroes]]. Vehicles were burned, offices ransacked and there were reports of many injuries but no deaths.&lt;ref&gt;Hollingworth, Clare, ''Mao and the Men Against Him'' (Jonathan Cape, London: 1985), pp. 297–298&lt;/ref&gt; In the aftermath, Deng Xiaoping was blamed for inciting the protests and stripped of all his party and government posts, albeit his party membership was retained at Mao's behest. Shortly thereafter, Hua was elevated to First Vice Chairman of the CPC Central Committee and Premier of the State Council.

Following the [[Tangshan Earthquake]] in July, Hua visited the devastated area and helped direct relief efforts, while the Gang of Four were nowhere to be seen.

==Removing the Gang of Four==
Mao died on September 9, 1976. At the time, the highest power organ of the country, the Politburo Standing Committee, consisted of Hua, Ye Jianying, Zhang Chunqiao, and Wang Hongwen; Ye was in semi-retirement, and Zhang and Wang were part of the [[Gang of Four]]. Hua knew that in the post-Mao power vacuum, his position vis-a-vis the Gang of Four's would be a zero sum game. That is, if the Gang of Four were not removed through use of force, the Gang may attempt to oust him pre-emptively.&lt;ref name="koushu"&gt;{{cite news|title=华国锋口述：怀仁堂事变真实经过|url=http://culture.dwnews.com/history/news/2016-11-03/59779675.html|work=Duowei|date=November 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hua made contact with Ye days after Mao's death to discuss plans about the Gang of Four. Ye had grown disillusioned with the Gang before Mao's death, so he and Hua came to a quick agreement to conspire against the Gang. The two enlisted the support of [[Wang Dongxing]], who had command of the elite [[Central Security Bureau of the Communist Party of China|Unit 8341]], as well as other leading figures on the Politburo, including [[Wu De]] and [[Chen Xilian]].&lt;ref name="koushu"/&gt; The group discussed different ways to remove the Gang, including holding a Politburo or Central Committee meeting to oust them through established party procedure, but the idea was shot down because the Central Committee was, at the time, composed of many of the Gang's supporters. Eventually, the group decided to use force.

The members of the Gang were arrested on October 6, soon after midnight.&lt;ref name=hsü/&gt; Hua had summoned Zhang Chunqiao, Wang Hongwen, and Yao Wenyuan to a meeting at Zhongnanhai, ostensibly to discuss the fifth volume of Mao's "Selected Works". They were arrested while walking into the meeting at Huairen Hall. According to Hua's own recollection of events, he and Marshal Ye were the only two leaders present at the "meeting", awaiting the arrival of the members of the Gang. Upon the arrest of each of the three, Hua personally announced to them the reasons for their detention. Hua said that they had engaged in "anti-party and anti-socialism" acts and "conspired to usurp power". Jiang Qing and [[Mao Yuanxin]] were arrested at their respective residences.&lt;ref&gt;Hsin, Chi. ''The Case of the Gang of Four.'' Revised ed. Hong Kong: Cosmo, 1978. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; A task force led by [[Geng Biao]] occupied the headquarters of the party's main propaganda organs, which were considered a part of the Gang's turf at the time.  Another group was dispatched to stabilize Shanghai, the Gang's main regional power base. At a Politburo meeting the next day, Hua Guofeng assumed the posts of [[Chairman of the Communist Party of China|Chairman of the CPC Central Committee]] and the [[Central Military Commission (People's Republic of China)|Central Military Commission]].&lt;ref name=hsü&gt;{{Citation| last       = Hsü| first      = Immanuel Chung-yueh| year       = 1990| title      = China Without Mao: the Search for a New Order| publisher  = Oxford University Press| isbn       = 0-19536-303-5| page       = 18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Party Chairman and Premier==

During his relatively short leadership, Hua was credited for quickly ousting the Gang of Four from political power and thus became the leader whose emergence marked the end of the [[Cultural Revolution]]. The jubilation following the incarceration of the Gang of Four and the popularity of the new ruling triumvirate (Hua Guofeng, [[Ye Jianying]], and [[Li Xiannian]], a temporary alliance of necessity) were succeeded by calls for the restoration to power of Deng Xiaoping and the elimination of leftist influence throughout the political system.&lt;ref name="The Post-Mao Period, 1976-78"&gt;[http://www.ibiblio.org/chinesehistory/contents/01his/c05s03.html#02The Post-Mao Period, 1976-78 http://www.ibiblio.org/chinesehistory/contents/01his/c05s03.html#02The Post-Mao Period, 1976-78], additional text.&lt;/ref&gt; Hua's economic and political programs involved the restoration of Soviet-style industrial planning and party control similar to that followed by China before the [[Great Leap Forward]]. However, this model was rejected by supporters of [[Deng Xiaoping]], who argued for a more market-based economic system. This argument was decisively resolved in Deng's favor in late 1978, which is generally taken as the start of the era of [[Chinese economic reform]]. Hua also attempted reforming state protocol as a method of elevating his prestige. In 1978 all party meetings were to hang portraits of Mao and Hua side-by-side, including at the National People's Congress and CPC Party Congress meetings. All schools were required to hang Hua's picture next to Mao's. Hua also changed the [[March of the Volunteers|Chinese national anthem]] to incorporate [[Mao Zedong]] and the [[Chinese Communist Party]], switching the tone from being war-rallying to purely Communist propaganda. These lyrics were eventually rejected. Hua Guofeng continued to use the terminology of the Cultural Revolution, but he criticized certain aspects of it, including the education reform, the revolutionary committees' activity and other excesses, blaming the Gang of Four. State media referred to him as "the wise leader".

In February 1978, the party met to approve a new state constitution, which Hua was heavily involved in drafting. This document, which attempted to restore some rule of law and planning mechanisms from the PRC's original 1956 constitution, still contained references to continuous revolution and proletarian internationalism; it was replaced only four years later with a different constitution that dropped all mentions of Maoism. Hua and other party conservatives such as Li Xiannian also drafted an ambitious ten year economic plan which sought to create a Soviet-style economy based around heavy industry and energy, but it was quickly scrapped in favor of a cheaper and more doable five-year plan which prioritized light industry and consumer goods.

Hua's weak personality and continued loyalty to Maoism did not inspire a nation and party leadership weary of the Cultural Revolution, and he quickly came to be seen as a Mao sycophant with no real ideas of his own. His slogan "Whatever Chairman Mao said, we will say and whatever Chairman Mao did, we will do" was soon referred to sarcastically as "the Two Whatevers" and became one of the major reasons for his fall from grace. Although Hua later distanced himself from Maoism and began to support some reformist ideas, his unrealistic economic plans proved a further strike against him.

On October 1979, Hua went on a European tour, the first of its kind for a Chinese leader after 1949. He traveled to West Germany and France. On 28 October Hua visited the United Kingdom and met with British Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]]. The two engaged in friendly talks and discussed the future of Hong Kong, which was a [[British Overseas Territories|British Overseas Territory]] at the time.

Chairman Hua visited Derby's [[British Rail]] [[Railway Technical Centre]] to observe the development of the [[Advanced Passenger Train]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.huaguofeng.org/tuji_xq.php?cid=6&amp;id=1801 |work=Hua Guofeng Memorial Website | title=Chairman Hua Officially Visits the UK | date=28 October 1979 | accessdate=27 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; His visit coincided with the donation of the Chinese Government Railways Steam Locomotive 4-8-4 KF Class No 7 to the [[National Railway Museum]] in York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nrm.org.uk/OurCollection/LocomotivesAndRollingStock/CollectionItem?objid=1987-7001 |work=National Railway Museum | title=Chinese Government Railways Steam Locomotive 4-8-4 KF Class No 7 | date=10 April 2017 | accessdate=10 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chairman Hua also went to a farm in Oxfordshire and visited [[Oxford University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/october/28/newsid_4114000/4114964.stm |work=BBC News | title=1979: Chairman Hua arrives in London | date=28 October 1979 | accessdate=27 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hua was one of the last foreigners to visit [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]], the Shah of Iran, before he was [[Iranian Revolution|overthrown in 1979]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A55414-2004Nov16.html | work=The Washington Post | title=Iran's New Alliance With China Could Cost U.S. Leverage | first=Robin | last=Wright | date=17 November 2004 | accessdate=4 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His interpretation of the [[Three Worlds Theory]], leading to a general rapprochement with Western powers, divided Maoist parties throughout the world. Many of them, including [[Shining Path]], criticized him for this and accused him of being a traitor for ousting Jiang Qing and alinging the Party to the interests of Western imperialists.{{Citation needed|reason=Dubious|date=October 2018}}

At the [[3rd Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China]], after which [[Deng Xiaoping]] became the ''de facto'' leader of China as his idea for economic reform was adopted by the Party, Hua Guofeng was implicitly criticized for serving concurrently as Chairman of the Central Committee, Chairman of the Central Military Commission and Premier of the State Council. This was reverted between 1980 and 1981, as the three posts were assigned to three different people, but this system was re-established by [[Jiang Zemin]] as he became "[[paramount leader]]" of China.

==Ousting and death==

[[File:Tomb of Hua Guofeng 4.JPG|thumb|Tomb of Hua Guofeng]]
As [[Deng Xiaoping]] gradually gained control over the CCP, Hua was denounced for promoting the [[Two Whatevers]] policy. As early as January 1979, state media had stopped referring to him as "the wise leader" and he was replaced by [[Zhao Ziyang]] as Premier in 1980, by [[Hu Yaobang]] as Party Chairman and by Deng himself as chairman of the Central Military Commission in 1981. Hua gave [[self-criticism]] sessions and eventually renounced the Two Whatevers policy as a mistake. Both Zhao and Hu were protégés of Deng who were dedicated to [[Chinese economic reform]]. Hua Guofeng was demoted to junior Vice Chairman; and when this post was abolished in 1982, he remained as an ordinary member of the Central Committee, a position which he held until the 16th Party Congress of November 2002, despite having passed the mandatory retirement age of 70 in 1991.

After Hua's downfall in 1980-81, the party's official verdict was that he had done good work by removing the Gang of Four, but afterwards committed "serious errors".

The ousting of Hua was significant in at least two respects. First, it demonstrated the unimportance of official titles in the Chinese Communist Party during the late-1970s and early-1980s. Despite being the official leader of the party, the state, and the army, Hua was unable to defeat a leadership challenge by Deng Xiaoping. Second, Hua's ousting reflected the more enlightened policies initiated by Deng Xiaoping in which disgraced party members would merely be stripped of their position, but not jailed or otherwise physically harmed.

In early 2002, Hua officially lost his seat on the Central Committee of the CPC. It was reported that he retired voluntarily for age and health reasons, although the party did not officially confirm this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Pakistan Daily Times Article |work=[[Daily Times (Pakistan)|Daily Times]] |url=http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=story_15-11-2002_pg4_1 |accessdate=10 February 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was, however, invited to the [[17th National Congress of the Communist Party of China|17th Party Congress]] in 2007 as a special delegate and he appeared at a ceremony in December 2008 to commemorate the 115th anniversary of Mao Zedong's birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = 十七大之后拜访华国锋 (Visiting Hua Guofeng after the 17th Congress)|work = Sohu|url=http://cul.sohu.com/20080505/n256668060.shtml |accessdate=22 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite retaining formal party positions, Hua distanced himself from active participation in politics. His main hobby was grape cultivation, and he kept up with current affairs by subscribing to a host of newspapers. Hua's health deteriorated in 2008, and he was hospitalized for kidney and heart complications.&lt;ref&gt;[http://politics.people.com.cn/GB/99014/8080963.html 简单的晚年生活 华国锋远离政治的日子] (A simple late life: Hua Guofeng's days away from politics), ''China News Weekly'', 21 September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; He died in Beijing on 20 August 2008.&lt;ref&gt;Keith Bradsher and William J.

==Family==
Hua married Han Zhijun in January 1949. They had four children, all of whom are surnamed "Su" (苏/蘇), in accordance with Hua's birth name. Their first son, Su Hua, is a retired [[People's Liberation Army Air Force|Air Force]] officer. Their second son, Su Bin, is a retired army officer. Their older daughter, Su Ling, is a party and union official at the [[Civil Aviation Administration of China]]. Their younger daughter, Su Li, works for the [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|State Council]].

'''[[Junius]]''' was the [[nom de plume|pseudonym]] of a writer who contributed a series of political letters critical of the government of [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]] to the ''[[Public Advertiser]]'',&lt;ref&gt;The ''Public Advertiser'' was a political newspaper run by [[Henry Sampson Woodfall]], presumably based in London. His brother of William Woodfall later established the ''Daily'', a paper that reported on parliamentary debates.&lt;/ref&gt; from 21 January 1769 to 21 January 1772 as well as several other London newspapers such as the ''[[London Evening Post]]''.

Charges were brought against several people, of whom two were convicted and sentenced. Junius himself was aware of the advantages of concealment, as he wrote in a letter to [[John Wilkes]] dated 18 September 1771. Two generations after the appearance of the letters, speculation as to the authorship of Junius was rife. [[Philip Francis (politician)|Sir Philip Francis]] is now generally, but not universally, believed to be the author.

==Current scholarly views==

According to Alan Frearson&lt;ref&gt;Alan Frearson, "The Identity of Junius", ''Journal for Eighteenth-Century Studies''
Volume 7 Issue 2, Pages 211 – 227, Published Online: 1 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; there is scholarly consensus in favour of [[Philip Francis (politician)|Sir Philip Francis]]; he divides the evidence into four classes, and reports that each class "points most strongly to Francis".

This scholarly theory has been called the "Franciscan theory", at least since [[Abraham Hayward]]'s ''More about Junius: The Franciscan theory unsound'' (1868). Numerous subsequent publications have been written by those sceptical about the identification with Francis. [[John Cannon (historian)|John Cannon]], editor of an edition of the ''Letters'' published in 1978, adhered to the Franciscan theory. As [[Francesco Cordasco]] puts it, "while the Franciscan theory has recently enjoyed new life, it remains contested and impossible to demonstrate categorically".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite ODNB |first=Francesco |last=Cordasco |title=Junius (fl. 1768–1773)|origyear=2004|date=January 2008 |id=45912}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early guesses==
[[Joseph Parkes]], author with [[Herman Merivale]] of the ''Memoirs of Sir Philip Francis'' (1867), gave a list of more than forty persons who had been supposed to be Junius.{{sfn|Hannay|1911|p=558}}&lt;ref&gt;An 1855 edition of ''Junius'' by John Wade has over 30 names in common, but adds: [[Charles Pratt, 1st Earl Camden|Lord Camden]], [[Samuel Dyer (translator)|Samuel Dyer]]. Dyer was believed to be Junius by [[Edmond Malone]] and [[Joshua Reynolds]].({{Cite DNB |first=Alsager Richard |last=Vian |wstitle=Dyer, Samuel |volume=16|page=288–289}})&lt;/ref&gt;

Taylor approached to Sir Philip for leave to publish, and received evasive answers. [[Charles Chabot]] was convinced of the identity of Junius and Francis, based on the handwriting and other collateral evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Chabot |first=C. |title=The Handwriting of Junius Professionally Investigated |year=1871 |location=London |publisher=John Murray}}&lt;/ref&gt; The similarity of his handwriting to the disguised hand used by the writer of the letters is close. His family maintained that Sir Philip addressed a copy of verses to a Miss Giles in the handwriting of Junius. The similarity of Junius and Francis in regard to their opinions, their likes and dislikes, their knowledge, and their known movements are also close.

[[Edward Turner Boyd Twistleton]] employed Chabot to report again on the handwriting, based on manuscripts in the British Museum. He published Chabot's evidence that Francis was the writer as ''Handwriting of Junius professionally investigated'' (1871).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite DNB |first=George Clement |last=Boase |authorlink = George Clement Boase|wstitle=Twisleton, Edward Turner Boyd |volume=57 |page=390}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1962, a computer-aided analysis by [[Alvar Ellegård]] examined the styles and word-usages of the Junius letters. This allowed some statistical conclusions to be drawn about the author—they used "among" thirty-five times, but never used "amongst", for example. Comparing this to the writings of some of the suspects proved informative; Sir Philip Francis used "among" 66 times, and "amongst" only once. A group of general writers of the time, tested as a control, used "among" 512 times and "amongst" 114. Several hundred such words and phrases were found that could be tests of style—"farther" or "further", for example. Ellegård concluded that it was 30,000 times more likely than not that Junius was, in fact, Francis.

The communication was copied into the 'St. James's Chronicle' (London, 1803), and the idea was afterwards worked up with much ingenuity by Dr. [[Thomas Girdlestone]] [q.v.] in 'Facts tending to prove that General Lee was never absent from this country for any length of time during the years 1767–72, and that he was the author of "Junius's Letters,"' London, 1813."

His debut solo album ''[[Queen of Denmark]]'' was named in 2010 the best album of the year by ''[[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo]]''.&lt;ref name=numberone /&gt; In 2015, his third studio album, ''[[Grey Tickles, Black Pressure]]'' received widespread critical acclaim,&lt;ref name=charts&gt;[http://www.metacritic.com/music/grey-tickles-black-pressure/john-grant/critic-reviews Grey Tickles, Black Pressure - Metacritic].

== Early life ==
Grant was born in Buchanan, Michigan but later raised in Parker, [[Colorado]] by his engineer father and housewife mother.&lt;ref name="Grundy"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/jun/20/john-grant-queen-of-denmark|title=John Grant: 'It was horrifying. I got out just in time' {{!}} Interview|last=Grundy|first=Gareth|date=2010-06-19|website=the Guardian|access-date=2018-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was brought up in an orthodox Methodist household, at odds with his emerging sexuality. At high school he was, on occasion, bullied both physically and emotionally by his fellow pupils.&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0848bll|title=Reykjavik, Series 3, Reimagining the City - BBC Radio 4|website=BBC|access-date=2018-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grant now sings openly, often with caustic candour, about the landmark experiences that have pained and shaped his complex life to date; It took Grant until his mid-twenties to feel comfortable with his sexuality, having been raised in an environment where it was "clear that those people were going to hell".&lt;ref name="Grundy"/&gt; Grant moved to Germany in 1988 to continue his study of languages and is fluent in German, Russian and Spanish, as well as Icelandic, the language of his newly adopted home.&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"/&gt;

==The Czars==
{{main article|The Czars}}
After some years in Germany studying and working Grant returned to the US in 1994. Along with Chris Pearson, Andy Moneley, Jeff Linsenmaier and Roger Green he formed the alternative, [[Denver]]-based rock band [[The Czars]]. They enjoyed critical success, releasing six studio albums, but commercial recognition proved elusive. These were troubling years for Grant as he battled with drug and alcohol addictions. On top of this he struggled with severe anxiety, a condition that has stalked him throughout his adult life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/mar/03/john-grant-interview-singer-songwriter|title=John Grant: 'I wanted to let some of the anger out'|last=Lynskey|first=Dorian|date=2013-03-03|website=the Guardian|access-date=2018-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; While still with The Czars, Grant, who had always been a huge fan of [[Cocteau Twins]], met with [[Simon Raymonde]]. Raymonde had recently started the record label [[Bella Union]] and although not particularly looking for new acts at that time he sensed the potential. He agreed to produce two Czars albums. Unfortunately the alcohol and substance abuse continued for Grant and after releasing ''Sorry I Made You Cry'' in 2004 the band split.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/jun/20/john-grant-queen-of-denmark|title=John Grant: 'It was horrifying. I got out just in time' {{!}} Interview|last=Grundy|first=Gareth|date=2010-06-19|website=the Guardian|access-date=2018-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the demise of the band, Grant moved to New York and "returned to mainstream society", as he put it at the time.&lt;ref name="Grundy"/&gt; He worked for a while as a waiter before taking up work as a medical interpreter for Russian in a city hospital. He felt compelled to continue writing music during this time. It was also during this time that Grant began the process of confronting the addictions that had been so destructive during his time with the Czars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/music/what-to-listen-to/john-grant-interview-miss-drugs-time/|title=John Grant interview: 'I miss drugs all the time'|last=Smith|first=Patrick|date=2017-04-26|work=The Telegraph|access-date=2018-02-24|issn=0307-1235}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Best Of (The Czars album)|Best Of]]'' was released in December 2014 on the [[Bella Union]] label.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.musicomh.com/reviews/albums/czars-best|title=The Czars – Best Of {{!}} Album Reviews |website=Musicomh.com|access-date=2018-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Solo career ==
=== ''Queen of Denmark'' (2010-2012) ===
While still working and writing in New York, it was the Texan folk rock group [[Midlake]] who eventually persuaded Grant to return to the recording studio.&lt;ref name="The Independent"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/john-grant-this-addictive-personality-permeates-my-entire-being-8547573.html|title=John Grant: 'This addictive personality permeates my entire being'|date=2013-03-24|work=The Independent|access-date=2018-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; They joined him to record and produce what would be his first solo album; ''[[Queen of Denmark (album)|Queen of Denmark]]''. It was released on the [[Bella Union]] label in April 2010. Described as a "deeply personal album" it explores Grant's struggles with alcohol and drug addiction as well as his personal struggle to reconcile his sexuality. "Brothers" was how Grant described Midlake when interviewed at a later date for the publication MusicOhm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.musicomh.com/features/interviews/john-grant|title=Interview: John Grant {{!}} Interviews |website=Musicomh.com|access-date=2018-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Queen of Denmark (album)|Queen of Denmark]]'' received critical acclaim and was chosen as Best Album Of 2010 by the British music magazine [[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo]].&lt;ref name=numberone&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.albumoftheyear.org/list/43-mojos-top-50-albums-of-2010/|title=MOJO's Top 50 Albums of 2010|work=Album of The Year|access-date=2018-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grant was also nominated as Best Breakthrough Act at the Mojo Awards and won Best Live Act for Mojo.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.brooklynvegan.com/mojos-top-album/|title=MOJO’s Top Albums of 2010 + John Grant tour dates &amp; stream|website=BrooklynVegan|access-date=2018-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Filmmaker [[Andrew Haigh]] used several songs from his album ''Queen of Denmark'' are used in Haigh's 2011 movie ''[[Weekend (2011 film)|Weekend]]''.&lt;ref name=out&gt;[http://www.out.com/entertainment/music/2013/01/30/listen-john-grant-pale-green-ghosts LISTEN: John Grant's 'Pale Green Ghosts']. ''[[Out (magazine)|Out]]'', January 30, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2012 at London's Meltdown Festival while performing on stage with [[Hercules and Love Affair|Hercules &amp; Love Affair]], Grant announced that he was HIV positive.&lt;ref name="The Independent"/&gt;

===''Pale Green Ghosts'' (2013-2014)===
During a trip to Iceland to perform at the [[Airwaves Festival]], Grant met Birgir Þórarinsson aka Biggi Veira of Icelandic electronic pop group [[GusGus]]. The electronic, synthesized dance sounds that Grant was looking for and experimented with in Veira's studio formed much of the backdrop to his second album ''[[Pale Green Ghosts]]'', which Veira himself produced. [[Sinéad O'Connor]] was guest vocalist on three of the tracks, including "It Doesn't Matter To Him". Grant was quickly and deeply touched by the people and landscape of Iceland, so much so that he now has a permanent home in [[Reykjavík]].

''Pale Green Ghosts'' was released in March 2013 to critical acclaim. ''Pale Green Ghosts'' was [[Rough Trade Records]] Album Of The Year,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/nov/20/rough-trade-poll-2013-john-grant-pale-green-ghosts|title=John Grant's Pale Green Ghosts tops Rough Trade shops poll of the best albums of 2013|date=2013-11-20|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=2018-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and number 2 in ''[[The Guardian]]'s'' Best Album of 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2013/dec/19/best-albums-2013-john-grant-pale-green-ghosts-number-2|title=John Grant's Pale Green Ghosts tops Rough Trade shops poll of the best albums of 2013|date=2013-11-20|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=2018-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; A nomination for Best Solo Artist at the [[Q Awards]] followed (with [[David Bowie]] and [[Laura Marling]] among the other nominees).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/rockandpopmusic/10288729/David-Bowie-nominated-for-Q-Awards-2013.html|title=David Bowie nominated for Q Awards 2013|last=Vincent|first=Alice|date=2013-09-05|access-date=2018-02-26|issn=0307-1235}}&lt;/ref&gt; A nomination for Best International Male Solo Artist at the [[Brit Awards]] in 2014 followed,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/brit-awards/10560925/Brit-Awards-nominations-2014-full-list.html|title=Brit Awards nominations 2014: full list|last=Reporters|first=Telegraph|date=2014-02-18|access-date=2018-02-26|issn=0307-1235}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Attitude (magazine)|''Attitude'']] named Grant Man of The Year 2014.

In 2013 Grant put his linguistic skills to effect by translating [[Ásgeir Trausti]]'s album ''[[Dýrð í dauðaþögn]]''. The English version titled ''In the Silence'' was released in October of that year. In 2014 he co-wrote "No Prejudice", the Icelandic entry for the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2014|Eurovision Song Contest]] performed by [[Pollapönk]].

In 2014 Grant guested on the 40th anniversary release of [[Elton John]]'s ''[[Goodbye Yellow Brick Road]]'', covering the song "Sweet Painted Lady". Always on the lookout for likely or unlikely collaborations, Grant has been keen to explore his passion for electronic and dance music, guesting on the album ''[[The Feast of The Broken Heart]]'', by [[Hercules and Love Affair|Hercules &amp; Love Affair]] and released on [[Moshi Moshi Records]].

In the first half of 2014, Grant joined British group [[Elbow (band)|Elbow]] on the North American leg of their tour. In October 2014, accompanied by the [[BBC Philharmonic Orchestra]], Grant recorded tracks from his first two albums for a concert on [[BBC Radio 6 Music]] arranged by [[Fiona Brice]]. This was released as an album: ''John Grant And The BBC Philharmonic Orchestra: Live In Concert''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.clashmusic.com/reviews/john-grant-live-in-concert-with-the-bbc-philharmonic-orchestra|title=John Grant - Live In Concert (With The BBC Philharmonic Orchestra)|work=[[Clash Magazine]]|access-date=2018-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grant concluded 2014 with rave reviews following his UK concert hall tour with the [[Royal Northern Sinfonia]]. [[Clash (magazine)|ClashMusic.com]] wrote that the concert "could honestly be one of the greatest gigs of all time at London's [[Royal Festival Hall]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.clashmusic.com/live/live-report-john-grant-with-the-royal-northern-sinfonia-at-royal-festival-hall-london|title=Live Report: John Grant with The Royal Northern Sinfonia, at Royal Festival Hall, London|work=Clash Magazine|access-date=2018-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; That night, he duetted with [[Alison Goldfrapp]] on (the [[Nancy Sinatra]] and [[Lee Hazlewood]] song) "[[Some Velvet Morning]]" at the Royal Albert Hall.

=== ''Grey Tickles, Black Pressure'' (2015-2017)===
2015 saw Grant release his third solo album ''[[Grey Tickles, Black Pressure]]''. Recorded in [[Dallas]] and produced by [[John Congleton]], it featured guest vocalists [[Tracey Thorn]] ([[Everything But The Girl]]) and [[Amanda Palmer]] ([[The Dresden Dolls]]), and former [[Siouxsie and the Banshees]] drummer [[Budgie (musician)|Budgie]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/john-grant-mn0000218781/biography |title=John Grant Biography|website=AllMusic|access-date=2018-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon its release, the album was hailed by the likes of ''[[NME]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= |url=http://www.nme.com/reviews/john-grant/16276 |title=NME Reviews – John Grant – 'Grey Tickles, Black Pressure' |publisher=Nme.Com |date= |accessdate=2015-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Guardian]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Alexis Petridis |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/oct/01/john-grant-grey-tickles-black-pressure-review |title=John Grant: Grey Tickles, Black Pressure review – trauma, jokes and joy &amp;#124; Music |publisher=The Guardian |date= |accessdate=2015-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Trynka |first=Paul |url=http://www.mojo4music.com/21897/john-grant-grey-tickles-black-pressure/ |title=John Grant – Grey Tickles, Black Pressure &amp;#124; MOJO |publisher=Mojo4music.com |date=2015-10-02 |accessdate=2015-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before embarking on a worldwide tour, Grant appeared on UK TV show ''[[Later with Jools Holland]]'' in early October.

'''John Barrett Hasted''' (February 17, 1921 – May 4, 2002) was a [[British people|British]] physicist and [[folk music]]ian.&lt;ref&gt;David Gregory. (2002). ''In Memoriam: John Hasted, 1921-2002''. Canadian Folk Music/Bulletin de musique folklorique canadienne, Vol 36, No. 2. pp. 3-8.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Hasted was born in Woodbridge, Suffolk. He attended [[Winchester College]] and won a choral scholarship to [[New College, Oxford]], where he read chemistry and later focused on atomic physics.&lt;ref name=Hunt/&gt;

From 1968 until his retirement he was head of experimental physics at Birkbeck College, London. He was the author of ''Physics Of Atomic Collisions'' (1964), ''Aqueous Dielectrics'' (1973), ''The Metal Benders'' (1981), and his autobiography, ''Alternative Memoirs'' (1992).

He was also active as a folk singer, folk club organiser, and leading light of the Second British [[Folk Revival]].&lt;ref name=Hunt&gt;Ken Hunt. [https://www.theguardian.com/news/2002/sep/09/guardianobituaries.obituaries "John Hasted"]. ''The Guardian''. September 9, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Parapsychology==

Hasted was a believer in [[psychokinesis]]. He endorsed the [[spoon bending]] feats of [[Uri Geller]] and other alleged psychics. A 1987 report by the [[National Academy of Sciences|United States National Academy of Sciences]] investigated the paranormal claims of Hasted and chided him for his naiveté for playing into the hands of anyone intending on deceiving him. The report wrote that the conditions of his 1974 tests with Geller did not rule out the possibility of trickery.&lt;ref&gt;[[Kendrick Frazier]]. (1990). ''The Hundredth Monkey and Other Paradigms of the Paranormal''. Prometheus Books. pp. 159–160. {{ISBN|978-0-87975-655-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hasted believed that children could paranormally bend paperclips inside a glass sphere, provided the sphere had a hole in it and were allowed to take the sphere into a room unobserved. [[Martin Gardner]] wrote Hasted was incapable of devising simple controls such as videotaping the children secretly.&lt;ref&gt;[[Martin Gardner]]. (1991). ''The New Age: Notes of a Fringe-Watcher''. Prometheus Books. pp. 28-29. {{ISBN|0-87975-644-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stephen North, a British psychic, was tested by Hasted in the late 1970s. Hasted claimed North had the psychokinetic ability to bend spoons and [[teleportation|teleport]] objects in and out of sealed containers.&lt;ref&gt;John Hasted. (1981). ''The Metal-Benders''. Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul. {{ISBN|0-7100-0597-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; North was tested in [[Grenoble]] on 19 December 1977 in scientific conditions and the results were negative.&lt;ref&gt;Marcel Blanc. (1978). [https://books.google.com/books?id=rTTswrb4YRMC&amp;pg=PA431&amp;dq=Jean-Pierre+Girard+psychokinesis&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=yH4fU8OaNcHT7AbQ3IHgBQ&amp;ved=0CDcQuwUwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Jean-Pierre%20Girard%20psychokinesis&amp;f=false "Fading Spoon Bender"]. ''New Scientist''. p. 431.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[James Randi]], during a test at [[Birkbeck, University of London|Birkbeck College]] North was observed to have bent a metal sample with his bare hands. Randi wrote "I find it unfortunate that [Hasted] never had an epiphany in which he was able to recognize just how thoughtless, cruel, and predatory were the acts perpetrated on him by fakers who took advantage of his naivety and trust."&lt;ref&gt;[[James Randi]]. (1982). Chapter ''Off the Deep End'' in ''[[Flim-Flam! Psychics, ESP, Unicorns, and Other Delusions]]''. Prometheus Books. {{ISBN|0-87975-198-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The physicist [[John G. Taylor|John Taylor]] gave ''The Metal Benders'' (1981) a negative review. According to Taylor the metal bending tests had poor controls and Hasted was not in the same room as the subjects for some of the tests. Taylor wrote "not only are the tests not watertight but the conjectured theory is monumentally silly." Hasted suggested in the book that paranormal effects arise through telepathy from the individual in a parallel universe.&lt;ref&gt;[[John G. Taylor|John Taylor]]. (1981). [https://books.google.com/books?id=Y_ZOoWgEMvgC&amp;pg=PA438&amp;dq=%22The+Metal+Benders+by+John+Hasted%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=MKUoU_y4H-jX0QXJpYGoAw&amp;ved=0CEcQuwUwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22The%20Metal%20Benders%20by%20John%20Hasted%22&amp;f=false "The Metal Benders by John Hasted"].

'''João Maria''' was the name given to three lay monks who were in turn active in southern Brazil during the second half of the 19th century and early 20th century, although two originally had other names and the third was only called João Maria after his death. They were all ascetic wanderers and preachers who healed with herbs. The third led a peasant revolt in 1912. Their followers think they were the same person in different incarnations, a saint. The [[Monge State Park]]{{efn|The [[Monge State Park]] is named after the first monk ({{lang-pt|Monge João Maria}}).{{sfn|Lapa: Parque Estadual do Monge ... Paraná Turismo}} }} maintains a cave where the first monk once lived, visited by thousands of pilgrims annually.

==João Maria D’Agostini==
[[File:O monge João Maria em 1861.jpg|thumb|João Maria D’Agostini in 1861]]
{{main|João Maria D’Agostini}}
The first João Maria was born in [[Piemont]], Italy.{{sfn|Cueto|Palmer|2014|p=94}}
As a young man he entered the seminary in Rome, but left before being ordained priest.
He wandered in Europe, then came to South America where he travelled in Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and finally Brazil.
There are records from 1844 of João Maria going from [[Pará]] to [[Rio de Janeiro]], where he became famous as a healer and counselor.
He moved to [[Sorocaba]] and continued to practice medicine and give advice.{{sfn|Olhos d'água do monge João Maria ... Prudentópolis}}

João Maria left the city of [[São Paulo]] and disappeared for a while before showing up in [[Rio Grande do Sul]].{{sfn|Olhos d'água do monge João Maria ... Prudentópolis}}
Thousands of people came to him at Cerro Campestre, in [[Santa Maria, Rio Grande do Sul]], drawn by word of the miraculous power of his waters.
The authorities of Rio Grande do Sul analyzed the water and found it was potable but no different from any other water.{{sfn|Silva|Kunrath|2015|p=1911}}
He then continued through Santa Catarina and [[Paraná (state)|Paraná]], where he lived in a cave near [[Lapa, Paraná|Lapa]] in 1847.
There he performed marriages, baptisms, healings and gave blessings to the local people.{{sfn|Olhos d'água do monge João Maria ... Prudentópolis}}
João Maria was not a revolutionary, but tried to improve the condition of the peasants.{{sfn|Feldman|Hata|1989|p=257}}
He organized processions, built chapels, blessed cattle and baptized children.
He cared for the sick, and his herbal teas became famous.{{sfn|Cueto|Palmer|2014|p=94}}

In 1848 João Maria was deported to Santa Catarina, then to Rio de Janeiro, where he was lost from sight for a while.{{sfn|Silva|Kunrath|2015|p=1911}}
He reappeared in [[Buenos Aires]] in 1853 and walked through Bolivia and all of south and central America until 1861, arriving in [[New Mexico]] in the United States in 1862, where he lived in the mountains.
He was assassinated there on 17 April 1869 at the age of 69.{{sfn|Silva|Kunrath|2015|p=1911}}
His tomb may be seen in New Mexico.{{sfn|Olhos d'água do monge João Maria ... Prudentópolis}}

==João Maria de Jesus==
[[File:Monge João Maria d. 1869.jpg|thumb|João Maria de Jesus in 1898]]
{{main|João Maria de Jesus}}
In 1890 João Maria de Jesus began to travel in southern Brazil.
His appearance, with a long white beard, and way of life were similar to Agostini.{{sfn|Silva|Kunrath|2015|p=1911}}
João Maria de Jesus was famous as a healer, and his medicine was thought to be miraculous.
It was said he could cure a person simply by praying for their health and prescribing a tea from a common herb called "monk's broom".{{sfn|Silva|Kunrath|2015|p=1912}}
He was quoted as saying , "He who does not know how to read the book of nature is illiterate in God's eyes."{{sfn|Cueto|Palmer|2014|p=94}}
His devotees thought that all objects or places that he touched became sacred, and would provide the hermit's blessings after he had disappeared.{{sfn|Silva|Kunrath|2015|p=1912}}

During the [[Federalist Riograndense Revolution|Federalist Revolution]] of 1893–95 he attended wounded rebels.{{sfn|Cueto|Palmer|2014|p=94}}
His teachings were prophetic and apocalyptic.
He said God would punish mankind with plagues of insects and bloody wars.
He thought the  [[First Brazilian Republic]] of 1889 was the work of the devil, and defended restoration of the monarchy as the "order of God".
He may have died in 1908 in hospital in [[Ponta Grossa]], Paraná, or may be buried in [[Lagoa Vermelha]], Rio Grande do Sul, but his devotees think he is still living in the Morro Taió, a hill in Santa Catarina.{{sfn|Silva|Kunrath|2015|p=1912}}

[[File:José Maria Monge do Contestado.jpg|thumb|José Maria de Santo Agostinho]]

==José Maria de Santo Agostinho==
{{main|José Maria de Santo Agostinho}}
[[José Maria de Santo Agostinho]] was formerly the soldier Miguel Lucena de Boaventura.
He settled in Taquaraçu, Santa Catarina, where he gained a reputation for healing powers.
He established a "people's pharmacy" where he would provide herbs, seeds and roots as well as prayers.{{sfn|Cueto|Palmer|2014|p=93}}
José Maria claimed to be the first João Maria's brother.{{sfn|Feldman|Hata|1989|p=257}}
He was the religious leader of the rebels during the "[[Contestado War]]" of 1912–16, in which small farmers and settlers in [[Paraná (state)|Paraná]] and Santa Catarina who had been expelled from their lands fought against the large capitalist landowners and companies.{{sfn|Cueto|Palmer|2014|p=94}}
He organized the dispossessed peasants and sharecroppers from his base at the Fazenda do Irani.{{sfn|Feldman|Hata|1989|p=257}}

The state government's security regiment marched to Taquaruçu to disperse his followers.
In a clash on 22 October 1912 the troops were defeated, but José Maria, who was leading the rebels, was killed.
In their religious excitement the rebels sanctified José Maria and began to call him São João Maria, thinking he would return in a few months with an enchanted army commanded by Saint Sebastian.{{sfn|Silva|Kunrath|2015|p=1913}}

==Legacy==
The people of the region began to conflate José Maria and the João Marias, uniting them as one person.
A socio-religious movement led by André Ferreira França began in [[Soledade]], Rio Grande do Sul, in 1935.
The group was persecuted and André França decided to withdraw, but was shot in a clash with the city's military brigade.{{sfn|Silva|Kunrath|2015|p=1913}}

There is a large literature about the monks called João Maria, but the devout population have little interest in their historicity and are much more concerned with the sacred characteristics attributed to them.{{sfn|Alves|2010|p=36}}
There are people today who think that João Maria, now more than 200 years old, still wanders in the region and works his miracles.
There are many places in the center and east of [[Paraná (state)|Paraná]] and Santa Catarina, the south of [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo]] and the north of [[Rio Grande do Sul]], where a small altar or cross marks a place where one of the "João Marias" would have passed.{{sfn|Kubaski|2012}}

The various wanderers recognized as the monk or prophet João Maria  all have strong similarities.
They are pilgrims, without home or family. They have withdrawn from the pleasures of the world to do penance by serving God.
They preach the [[Apocalypse]], when God will punish all sinners.
They have the miraculous power of healing, and they are immortal.{{sfn|Welter |2007|p=47}}

The [[Monge State Park]] was created in [[Lapa, Paraná|Lapa]] in 1960.
The main attraction is the monk's cave, a place of religious pilgrimage for thousands of faithful. 
It includes a source of water that it considered to be miraculous.{{sfn|Lapa: Parque Estadual do Monge ... Paraná Turismo}}
In 2015 Paraná Turismo was considering definition of a tourist circuit to visit the ''olhos d'água'' in places where the monk was present.
As of December 2015 the secretariat of tourism had identified 38 municipalities where the monk was present.{{sfn|Olhos d'água do monge João Maria ... Prudentópolis}}

The '''''Lalitavistara Sūtra''''' is a [[Mahayana sutras|Mahayana Buddhist sutra]] that tells the story of [[Gautama Buddha]] from the time of his descent from [[Tushita]] until his first sermon in the [[Sarnath|Deer Park]] near [[Varanasi]]. The term ''Lalitavistara'' has been translated "The Play in Full" or "Extensive Play," referring to the Mahayana view that the Buddha’s last incarnation was a "display" or "performance" given for the benefit of the beings in this world.

==Outline of the text==
The sutra consists of twenty-seven chapters:{{sfn|Dharmachakra Translation Committee|2013|p=iii-x}}
[[File:Lalitavistara - 136 N-104, The Gods offer the Buddha four Bowls (8599472134).jpg|thumb|270px|The Offering of the Four Bowls to the Buddha, [[Borobudur]], [[Indonesia]].]]

* Chapter 1: In the first chapter of the sutra, the Buddha is staying at [[Jetavana]] with a large gathering of disciples. One evening, a group of [[Deva (Buddhism)|divine beings]] visit the Buddha and request him to tell the story of his awakening for the benefit of all beings. The Buddha consents.
* Chapter 2: The following morning, the Buddha tells his story to the gathered disciples. He begins the story by telling of his previous life, in which the future Buddha was living in the heavenly realms surrounded by divine pleasures. In this previous life, he was known as the [[Bodhisattva]]. The Bodhisattva is enjoying the immense pleasures of his heavenly life, but due to his past aspirations, one day the musical instruments of the heavenly palace call out to him, reminding him of his prior commitment to attain awakening.
* Chapter 3: Upon being reminded of his previous commitments, the Bodhisattva announces, to the despair of the gods in this realm, that he will abandon his divine pleasures in order take birth in the human realm and there attain complete awakening.
* Chapter 4: Before leaving the heavenly realms, the Bodhisattva delivers one final teaching to the gods.
* Chapter 5: The Bodhisattva installs [[Maitreya]] as his regent in the heavenly realms and sets out for the human realm accompanied by great displays of divine offerings and auspicious signs.
* Chapter 6: The Bodhisattva enters into the human world via the womb of [[Maya (mother of the Buddha)|Queen Māyā]], where he resides for the duration of the pregnancy within a beautiful temple, enjoying the happiness of absorption.
* Chapter 7: The Bodhisattva takes birth at the grove in [[Lumbini|Lumbinī]] and declares his intention to attain complete awakening.
* Chapter 8: The infant Bodhisattva visits a temple where the stone statues rise up to greet him.
* Chapter 9: His father, [[Śuddhodana]], commissions marvelous jewelry for him.
* Chapter 10: The Bodhisattva attends his first day at school, where he far surpasses even the most senior tutors. This chapter is notable in that it contains a list a scripts known to the Bodhisattva which has been of great importance in the history of Indic scripts, particularly through the comparison of various surviving versions of the text.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Falk|first1=Harry|title=Schrift im alten Indien: ein Forschungsbericht mit Anmerkungen|date=1993|publisher=Gunter Narr Verlag|language=German|ref=harv|p=84}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Chapter 11: On a visit to the countryside as a young boy, he attains of the highest levels of [[samadhi]].
* Chapter 12: As a young man, he demonstrates his incredible prowess in the traditional worldly arts, and wins the hand of Gopā, a [[Shakya|Śākya]] girl whose father requires proof of the Bodhisattva’s qualities as a proper husband.
* Chapter 13: The Bodhisattva reaches maturity and is able enjoy life in the palace, where he is surrounded by all types of pleasure, including a large harem to entertain him. Seeing this, the gods gently remind him of his vows to awaken.
* Chapter 14: The Bodhisattva takes a trip outside of the palace walls to visit the royal parks. On this trip, he encounters a sick person, an old man, a corpse, and a religious mendicant.  Deeply affected by these sights, the Bodhisattva renounces his royal pleasures.
* Chapter 15: The Bodhisattva departs from the palace to begin the life of a religious seeker on a spiritual journey.
* Chapter 16: The Bodhisattva seeks out the foremost spiritual teachers of his day, and he quickly surpasses each of his teachers in understanding and meditative concentration. His extraordinary charisma also attracts many beings, such as the king of [[Magadha|Magadhā]], who requests the Bodhisattva to take up residence in his kingdom, but without success.
* Chapter 17: The Bodhisattva follows Rudraka, a renowned spiritual teacher. He quickly masters the prescribed trainings, but once again he is disappointed with the teachings. The Bodhisattva concludes that he must discover awakening on his own, and he sets out on a six-year journey of extreme [[asceticism]]. These practices take him to the brink of death.
* Chapter 18: The Bodhisattva concludes that the austere practices do not lead to awakening and, encouraged by some protective gods, he begins to eat a normal diet once again, and regains his health.
* Chapter 19: Sensing that he is on the verge of attaining his goal, the Bodhisattva sets out for the [[bodhimaṇḍa]], the sacred place where all bodhisattvas in their last existence attain full and complete awakening.
* Chapter 20: He arrives at the seat of awakening, and the gods perform a variety of miraculous displays, transforming the area so that it resembles a divine realm, fit for the epic achievement that awaits the Bodhisattva.
* Chapter 21: [[Mara (demon)|Māra]], the most powerful demon in the desire realm, arrives with the aim of preventing the Bodhisattva from attaining his goal. Māra attempts to terrify the Bodhisattva with his powerful army, and to seduce him with his seductive daughters, but he is unable to divert the Bodhisattva from his goal. Māra gives up, defeated.
* Chapter 22: Now the stage is set for the Bodhisattva to attain awakening under the [[Bodhi Tree]], a gradual process that unfolds throughout the night until he fully and perfectly awakens at dawn to become the Buddha ("awakened") or [[Tathāgata]], as he is known subsequent to his awakening.
* Chapter 23: Recognizing his epic achievement, the entire pantheon of divine beings visits the Thus-Gone One, making offerings and singing his praise.
* Chapter 24: For seven weeks following his awakening, the Buddha remains alone in the forest and does not teach. He is concerned that the truth he has discovered might be too profound for others to comprehend. Sensing this dilemma, the demon Māra tries to trick the Buddha one last time. Māra visits the Buddha and suggests that perhaps this would be a suitable time to pass into [[Parinirvana|parinirvāṇa]]! The Buddha rejects Māra’s advice, and finally Māra retreats. During these first seven weeks, the Buddha also encounters some local passersby, but no teaching is given.
* Chapter 25: The gods [[Brahmā]], [[Śakra (Buddhism)|Śakra]], and the other gods sense the Buddha’s hesitation. They visit the Buddha and formally request him to teach the Dharma. They repeat the request four times before the Buddha eventually consents. Upon his consent to teach, the Buddha says, “O Brahmā, the gates of nectar are opened”.
* Chapter 26: The Buddha determines that the most suitable students for his first teaching are his five former companions from the days when he was practicing austerities. The Buddha travels to Deer Park outside of [[Varanasi]], to meet his former companions. Initially, the companions are suspicious of the Buddha for having given up their austerity practices, but they are soon rendered helpless by his majestic presence and request teachings from him. The five companions instantly receive ordination and, in a seminal moment, the Buddha teaches them the [[Four Noble Truths]]: suffering, the origin of suffering, the cessation of suffering, and the path that leads to the cessation of suffering. Thus this occasion constitutes the birth of the Three Jewels: the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Saṅgha.
* Chapter 27: This marks the end of the teaching proper. Finally, in the epilogue, the Buddha encourages his retinue of gods and humans to take this sūtra as their practice and propagate it to the best of their abilities.

The story ends at the very moment when the Buddha has finally manifested all the qualities of awakening and is fully equipped to influence the world, as he did over the next forty-five years by continuously teaching the Dharma and establishing his community of followers.

==The Borobudur reliefs==
[[File:023 Lalitavistara, Bodhisattva in Tusita Heaven.jpg|thumb|375px|The [[Bodhisattva]] in [[Tushita]] before his birth as Siddhartha Gautama. [[Borobudur]]]]
The [[Borobudur]] reliefs contain a series of panels depicting the life of the Buddha as described in the ''Lalitavistara Sutra''.&lt;ref name="p21"&gt;Soekmono (1976), pp 21-22.&lt;/ref&gt; In these reliefs, the story starts from the glorious descent of the Buddha from the [[Tushita]] heaven, and ends with his first sermon in the Deer Park.

As an example of how widely the sutra was disseminated, the ''Lalitavistara Sutra'' was known to the Mantranaya ([[Vajrayana]]) practitioners of Borobudur,&lt;ref&gt;Miksic, J. (1990). ''Borobudur: Golden Tales of the Buddhas''. Singapore: Periplus Editions Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt; who had the text illustrated by stonemasons.{{refn|group=lower-alpha|The indigenous term ''Mantranaya'' is not a corruption or misspelling of ''mantrayana'', although it is largely synonymous. Mantranaya is the earlier term for the esoteric Mahayana teachings emphasizing [[mantra]]s. The clearly Sanskrit sounding ''Mantranaya'' is evident in [[Old Javanese]] tantric literature, particularly as documented in the oldest esoteric Buddhist tantric text in Old Javanese, the ''Sang Kyang Kamahayanan Mantranaya'' see Kazuko Ishii (1992).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://repository.tufs.ac.jp/bitstream/10108/23547/1/acs044014.pdf |title=The Correlation of Verses of the 'Sang Kyang Kamahayanan Mantranaya' with Vajrabodhi's 'Japa-sutra' |author=Ishii Kazuko | journal =Area and Culture Studies | volume =44 | year = 1992 | pages = |accessdate=2010-12-13 |quote= |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Historical context==
In the early 20th century, [[P. L. Vaidya]] believed that the finished [[Sanskrit]] text dated to the 3rd century A.D.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-ENG/wadd.htm | title=The So-Called "Mahapadana" Suttanta and the Date of the Pali Canon | author=L. A. Waddell | journal=The Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland| date=1914| pages=661–680 | accessdate=2011-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The text is also said to be a compilation of various works by no single author and includes materials from the [[Sarvastivada]] and the [[Mahayana]] traditions.

Concerning the origins of the text, the Dharmachakra Translation Committee states:{{sfn|Dharmachakra Translation Committee|2013|p=xii}}
:This scripture is an obvious compilation of various early sources, which have been strung together and elaborated on according to the Mahāyāna worldview. As such this text is a fascinating example of the ways in which the Mahāyāna rests firmly on the earlier tradition, yet reinterprets the very foundations of Buddhism in a way that fit its own vast perspective. The fact that the text is a compilation is initially evident from the mixture of prose and verse that, in some cases, contains strata from the very earliest Buddhist teachings and, in other cases, presents later Buddhist themes that do not emerge until the first centuries of the common era. Previous scholarship on ''The Play in Full'' (mostly published in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries) devoted much time to determining the text’s potential sources and their respective time periods, although without much success. [...] Although this topic clearly deserves further study, it is interesting to note that hardly any new research on this sūtra has been published during the last sixty years. As such the only thing we can currently say concerning the sources and origin of ''The Play in Full'' is that it was based on several early and, for the most part, unidentified sources that belong to the very early days of the Buddhist tradition.

==Numerals==
In the ''Lalitavistara'', the Buddha explains to a mathematician named Arjuna the system of numerals in multiples of 100, starting from a [[Indian numbering system|koti]] (in later literature 10^7 but this is uncertain) to a tallakshana (10^53 then).

This is a '''list of Haitians''', born in [[Haiti]] or possessing Haitian citizenship, notable in Haiti and abroad. Due to [[History of Haitian nationality and citizenship|Haitian nationality laws]], dual citizenship is now permitted by the [[Constitution of Haiti]], therefore people of [[Haitian diaspora|Haitian ancestry born outside of the country]] are not included in this list, unless they have renounced their foreign citizenship or have resided extensively in Haiti and made significant contributions to Haitian government or society. The list includes both native-born and naturalized Haitians, as well as permanent foreign residents who have been recognized internationally for artistic, cultural, economic, historical, criminal, or political reasons, among others. If not indicated here, their birth in Haiti and notability are mentioned in their main article. This list does '''not''' include fictional characters or Haitian associations and organizations.
{{rightTOC}}
{{dynamic list}}
&lt;!--

DO NOT add yourself, non-notable people or fictional characters to this list. You MUST add valid citations from reliable secondary sources (no personal/official websites) showing notability and Haitian birth/ancestry for any names added per [[WP:LISTPEOPLE]] and [[WP:NLIST]]. Any name placed here that doesn't have a Wikipedia article or article section about them, and who doesn't have a referenced statement in their article of their Haitian birth/ancestry will be immediately removed. Please consider using Wikipedia: Requested Articles, instead of this list, for listing notable people without articles, to avoid having otherwise notable names without articles removed from this list. Names without articles, even with references, may be removed if no article is written about them in a timely manner.

Even notable people need to be known OUTSIDE of Haiti for listing at this high level. Otherwise consider listing them under applicable province or municipality. Citation for this high level should be outside of Haiti such as Associated Press, Reuters, London Times, etc.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28507">One of  [[France]]'s '''Secretaries of State''' under the [[ancien régime]] was entrusted with control of the [[French Navy]] ([[Secretary of State of the Navy (France)]]. In 1791, this title was changed to '''Minister of the Navy'''. Before January 1893, this position also had responsibility for [[French colonial empire|France's colonies]], and was usually known as '''Minister of the Navy and Colonies'''.  In 1947 the naval ministry was absorbed into the [[Minister of Defence (France)|Ministry of Defence]] and reports to the [[Prime Minister of France]] and the [[President of the French Republic]] at the [[Elysee Palace]].

== History ==
The two French royal fleets (the [[Ponant fleet]] and [[Levant fleet]]) were put under the control of [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert|Colbert]] from 1662, whilst he was "[[intendant des finances]]" and "minister of state" – but not "secretary of state" : he only became secretary of state in 1669 after having bought his way into the post. From then on, right up to the [[French Revolution]], a secretary of state had responsibility for the fleet.

The secretary of state was responsible for the administration of both the navy (the "marine royale") and civilian (merchant marine) fleets, and for all France's ports, arsenals, consulates, and colonies, as well as the guardianship for all her commercial companies.

To his two original offices (the bureau du Ponant and bureau du Levant) other services were added over time:

*archives department, 1669 ; 
*office of the [[Ponant fleet|Ponant]] consulates, 1709 ; 
*office of the colonies, 1710 ; 
*bureau des classes, 1711 ; 
*department of maps and plans, 1720 ; 
*Office of the Levant Consulates, 1738, which was in 1743 merged with the Office of the Ponant Consulates under the name of Office of Commerce and Consulates 

These different offices and departments were regrouped into four super-departments by [[marshal of France|marshal]] [[Charles Eugène Gabriel de La Croix de Castries|de Castries]] in 1786.

[[File:ItzhakPerlmanWhitehouse2.jpg|thumb | right | [[Itzhak Perlman]], a polio survivor, plays the violin while seated.]]
This is a '''list of notable people who have survived paralytic poliomyelitis'''. [[Poliomyelitis]] (often simply called polio) is an acute [[virus|viral]] [[infectious disease|infection]] that involves the [[gastrointestinal tract]] and occasionally the [[central nervous system]]. [[Poliovirus]] is acquired by [[fecal-oral route|faecal-oral]] or oral transmission. Prior to the introduction of a [[polio vaccine|vaccine]] in 1955, infection was common, with [[epidemic]]s during the summer and autumn of [[temperate countries]]. An [[Poliomyelitis eradication|eradication]] programme has reduced the number of reported polio cases worldwide by more than 99% since the mid-1980s. Most infections are [[asymptomatic]]; a small number cause a minor illness that is indistinguishable from many other viral illnesses; less than 1% result in [[acute flaccid paralysis]]. This list only includes notable persons who had the paralytic form of polio. The extent of paralysis varies from part of a limb to [[quadriplegia]] and [[respiratory failure]]. The latter was often treated with an [[Negative pressure ventilator|iron lung]] until, it was hoped, the patient recovered. Around 30–40 years after contracting paralytic poliomyelitis, about 25–40% of cases lead to [[post-polio syndrome]]. Symptoms include muscle pain, further weakening of muscles and paralysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |quote="President Roosevelt played a meaningful role in the lives of untold numbers of citizens of the world – but especially for those who contracted polio at a young age. He was convinced that if the American people worked together to solve a problem, there was no obstacle that could not be conquered. In 1938, FDR established the March of Dimes, creating a network of volunteers and researchers that eventually yielded the Salk vaccine. Consequently, polio has been virtually eliminated from the planet", said Skelton.

'''Marcelo Costa de Andrade''' (born January 2, 1967), [[pseudonym|a.k.a.]] "The Vampire of Niterói", is a [[Brazil]]ian [[serial killer]] convicted of raping and killing 14 boys.

==Biography==
Marcelo Costa de Andrade was born on January 2, 1967 in [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Rio de Janeiro (state)|RJ]], [[Brazil]] and grew up in the [[Rocinha]] [[favela]]. He was beaten  and sexually abused regularly by the age of ten and began to prostitute himself at the age of fourteen. He was sent to a reform school but later escaped. At 16, Andrade began a relationship with an older man and tried to rape his ten-year-old brother at 17. At 23, he broke up with his lover and moved back in with his family. He found a low-paying job and began to attend the [[Universal Church of the Kingdom of God]].

From April to December 1991, Andrade raped and killed 14 young boys aged 6 to 13. He would lure the boys to secluded spots and rape them, then strangle or beat them to death. He had sex with the corpses and decapitated one of his victims.  He believed that doing so would send them to heaven. He also drank some of the victims' blood to "become as beautiful as them".

In December 1991, Andrade encountered ten-year-old Altair Abreu and his six-year-old brother Ivan. They were offered $20 to follow him to a church where he was going to light candles. Andrade then strangled Ivan to death and told Altair that he loved him and had sent Ivan to heaven. Andrade asked Altair to spend the night with him and Altair escaped the next morning after Andrade was going to take him to work with him.

Andrade was arrested on December 18, 1991, and declared insane on April 26, 1993.{{clarify|date=September 2018|reason=Was he tried for criminal offenses? Was he declared guilty or not guilty? Was he acquitted by reason of insanity or was he considered unfit for trial by reason of insanity? I see no mention of a trial or judicial declaration of guilt or innocence in the one cited source.}}

He voiced all of the major male [[Warner Bros.]] cartoon characters except for [[Elmer Fudd]], whose voice was provided by fellow radio personality [[Arthur Q. Bryan]], although Blanc later voiced Fudd as well after Bryan's death.&lt;ref name="BTVA"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/Mel-Blanc/ | title = Mel Blanc | accessdate = February 5, 2013 | publisher = Behind the Voice Actors}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He later voiced characters for [[Hanna-Barbera]]'s television cartoons, including [[Barney Rubble]] on ''[[The Flintstones]]'' and [[List of The Jetsons characters#Mr. Spacely|Mr. Spacely]] on ''[[The Jetsons]]''. Blanc was also the original voice of [[Woody Woodpecker]] for [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]] and provided vocal effects for the ''[[Tom and Jerry]]'' cartoons directed by [[Chuck Jones]] for [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]], replacing [[William Hanna]]. During the [[Old-time radio|golden age of radio]], Blanc also frequently performed on the programs of famous comedians from the era, including [[Jack Benny]], [[Abbott and Costello]], [[Burns and Allen]] and [[Judy Canova]].&lt;ref name="BTVA"/&gt;

==Early life==
Blanc was born in [[San Francisco]], [[California]] to [[History of the Jews in Russia|Russian-Jewish]] parents Frederick and Eva Blank, the younger of two children. He grew up in the [[Western Addition]] neighborhood in San Francisco,&lt;ref&gt;Mintun, Peter (April 13, 1993) [http://www.amacord.com/fillmore/museum/mintun01.html "Look Back to the Upper Fillmore"] ''The Fillmore Museum''&lt;/ref&gt; and later in [[Portland, Oregon]], where he attended [[Lincoln High School (Portland, Oregon)|Lincoln High School]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pdxhistory.com/html/mel_blanc.html |title=Mel Blanc |work=pdxhistory.com|accessdate=July 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Growing up, he had a fondness for voices and dialect which he began voicing at the age of 10. He claimed that he changed the spelling of his name when he was 16, from "Blank" to "Blanc", because a teacher told him that he would amount to nothing and be like his name, a "blank". Blanc joined the [[DeMolay International|Order of DeMolay]] as a young man, and was eventually inducted into its Hall of Fame.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://demolay.org/halloffame/bio.php?id=8|title=DeMolay Hall of Fame|author=DeMolay International|publisher=|accessdate=July 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; After graduating from high school in 1927, he split his time between leading an orchestra, becoming the youngest conductor in the country at the age of 19, and performing ''[[shtick]]'' in [[vaudeville]] shows around Washington, Oregon, and northern California.&lt;ref name="Blanc"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Blanc|first=Mel|first2=Philip|last2=Bashe|title=That's Not All, Folks!|location=Clayton South, VIC, Australia|publisher=Warner Books|year=1989|isbn=0-446-51244-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===Radio work===
Blanc began his radio career at the age of 19 in 1927, when he made his acting debut on the [[KGW]] program ''The Hoot Owls'', where his ability to provide voices for multiple characters first attracted attention. He moved to Los Angeles in 1932, where he met Estelle Rosenbaum (1909–2003), whom he married a year later, before returning to Portland. He moved to [[KEX (AM)|KEX]] in 1933 to produce and co-host his ''Cobweb and Nuts'' show with his wife Estelle, which debuted on June 15. The program played Monday through Saturday from 11:00 pm to midnight, and by the time the show ended two years later, it appeared from 10:30 pm to 11:00 pm.

With his wife's encouragement, Blanc returned to Los Angeles and joined Warner Bros.–owned [[KFWB]] in [[Hollywood, Los Angeles, California|Hollywood]] in 1935. He joined ''The Johnny Murray Show'', but the following year switched to [[CBS]] Radio and ''The [[Joe Penner]] Show''.

[[File:Jack Benny group photo.jpg|thumb|left|300px|The cast of ''[[The Jack Benny Program]]'', from left to right: [[Eddie Anderson (comedian)|Eddie Anderson]], [[Dennis Day]], [[Phil Harris]], [[Mary Livingstone]], [[Jack Benny]], [[Don Wilson (announcer)|Don Wilson]], and Mel Blanc]]

Blanc was a regular on the [[NBC]] Red Network show ''[[The Jack Benny Program]]'' in various roles, including voicing Benny's [[Maxwell automobile]] (in desperate need of a tune-up), violin teacher Professor LeBlanc, Polly the Parrot, Benny's pet polar bear Carmichael, the tormented department store clerk, and the train announcer. The first role came from a mishap when the recording of the automobile's sounds failed to play on cue, prompting Blanc to take the microphone and improvise the sounds himself. The audience reacted so positively that Benny decided to dispense with the recording altogether and have Blanc continue in that role. One of Blanc's most memorable characters from Benny's radio (and later TV) programs was "Sy, the Little Mexican", who spoke one word at a time. The famous "Sí ... Sy ... Sue ... sew" routine was so effective that no matter how many times it was performed, the laughter was always there, thanks to the comedic timing of Blanc and Benny.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|vIa7GYstYOQ|Video of Mel and Jack with one version of the Sy The Little Mexican routine}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blanc continued to work with him on radio until the series ended in 1955 and followed the program into television from Benny's 1950 debut episode through guest spots on NBC specials in the 1970s. They last appeared together on a [[Johnny Carson]] ''[[Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson|Tonight Show]]'' in January 1974. A few months later, Blanc spoke highly of Benny on a [[Tom Snyder]] ''[[Tomorrow (TV series)|Tomorrow]]'' show special aired the night of the comedian's death.

By 1946, Blanc appeared on over 15 radio programs in supporting roles. His success on ''The Jack Benny Program'' led to his own radio show on the [[CBS Radio Network]], ''[[The Mel Blanc Show]]'', which ran from September 3, 1946, to June 24, 1947. Blanc played himself as the hapless owner of a fix-it shop, as well as his young cousin Zookie.

Blanc also appeared on such other national radio programs as ''The [[Abbott and Costello]] Show'', the Happy Postman on ''[[Burns and Allen]]'', and as August Moon on ''Point Sublime''. During World War II, he appeared as Private Sad Sack on various radio shows, including ''G.I. Journal''. Blanc recorded a song titled "Big Bear Lake".

===Animation voice work during the golden age of Hollywood===
[[File:Private Snafu - Spies.ogv|thumb|[[Private Snafu]]: ''[[Spies (1943 film)|Spies]]'', voiced by Blanc in 1943]]
In December 1936, Mel Blanc joined [[Warner Bros. Cartoons#1933–44: Leon Schlesinger Productions|Leon Schlesinger Productions]], which was producing theatrical cartoon shorts for Warner Bros. After sound man [[Treg Brown]] was put in charge of cartoon voices, and [[Carl Stalling]] became music director, Brown introduced Blanc to animation directors [[Tex Avery]], [[Bob Clampett]], [[Friz Freleng]], and [[Frank Tashlin]], who loved his voices. The first cartoon Blanc worked on was ''Picador Porky'' (1937) as the voice of a drunken bull.&lt;ref name="Blanc"/&gt; He soon after received his first starring role when he replaced [[Joe Dougherty]] as Porky Pig's voice in ''[[Porky's Duck Hunt]]'', which marked the debut of Daffy Duck, also voiced by Blanc.

Following this, Blanc became a very prominent vocal artist for Warner Bros., voicing a wide variety of the "Looney Tunes" characters. Bugs Bunny, whom Blanc made his debut as in ''[[A Wild Hare]]'' (1940),&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Barrier (historian)|Barrier, Michael]] (2003), [https://www.amazon.com/dp/0195167295 ''Hollywood Cartoons: American Animation in Its Golden Age''], Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-19-516729-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bugs Bunny 1990"&gt;Adamson, Joe (1990). ''Bugs Bunny: 50 Years and Only One Grey Hare''. New York: Henry Holt. {{ISBN|978-0-8050-1190-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; was known for eating carrots frequently (especially while saying his catchphrase "Eh, what's up, doc?"). To follow this sound with the animated voice, Blanc would bite into a carrot and then quickly spit into a [[spittoon]]. One oft-repeated story is that Blanc was allergic to carrots, which Blanc denied.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tim Lawson (writer)|Tim Lawson]], ''The Magic Behind The Voices: A Who's Who of Cartoon Voice Actors'' University Press of Mississippi, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/2820/did-mel-blanc-hate-carrots "Did Mel Blanc hate carrots?"] A Straight Dope column by Science Advisory Board Member Rico November 4, 2008 (accessed November 20, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]]'s ''[[Pinocchio (1940 film)|Pinocchio]]'', Blanc was hired to perform the voice of Gideon the Cat. However, Gideon eventually was decided to be a mute character (similar to Dopey from ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]''), so all of Blanc's recorded dialogue was deleted except for a solitary hiccup, which was heard three times in the finished film.&lt;ref&gt;''No Strings Attached: The Making of Pinocchio'', Pinocchio DVD, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Blanc also originated the voice and laugh of [[Woody Woodpecker]] for the theatrical cartoons produced by [[Walter Lantz]] for [[Universal Pictures]], but stopped voicing Woody after the character's first three shorts when he was signed to an exclusive contract with Warner Bros. (his laugh was used in the cartoons until 1951, while his "Guess who!?" signature line was used until the end of the series in 1972).&lt;ref name="Blanc"/&gt;

During World War II, Blanc served as the voice of the hapless [[Private Snafu]] in various war-themed animated shorts.&lt;ref name="looney.goldenagecartoons.com"&gt;{{cite web | work = Looney | url = http://looney.goldenagecartoons.com/miscelooneyous/snafu/ | title = Misce-Looney-Ous: Situation Normal All Fouled Up | publisher = Golden age cartoons | accessdate = February 20, 2012 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080512092007/http://looney.goldenagecartoons.com/miscelooneyous/snafu/ | archivedate = May 12, 2008 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout his career, Blanc, aware of his talents, protected the rights to his voice characterizations contractually and legally. He, and later his estate, never hesitated taking civil action when those rights were violated. Voice actors at the time rarely received screen credits, but Blanc was an exception; by 1944, his contract with Warner Bros. stipulated a credit reading "Voice characterization(s) by Mel Blanc." According to his autobiography, Blanc asked for and received this screen credit from studio boss [[Leon Schlesinger]] after he was denied a salary raise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://movies2.nytimes.com/gst/movies/filmography.html?p_id=6641|title=''New York Times'' filmography|publisher=|accessdate=November 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, Blanc's screen credit was limited only to cartoons where he voiced Bugs Bunny, with any other shorts he worked on being uncredited. In the middle of 1945, the contract was amended to include a screen credit for cartoons featuring Porky Pig and/or Daffy Duck as well, save for any shorts made before that amendment occurred (''[[Book Revue]]'' and ''[[Baby Bottleneck]]'' are examples, despite being released after the fact). But by the end of 1946, Blanc began receiving a screen credit in any subsequent Warner Bros. cartoon for which he provided voices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mel Blanc: From Anonymity To Offscreen Superstar (The advent of on-screen voice credits)|url=http://cartoonresearch.com/index.php/mel-blanc-from-anonymity-to-offscreen-superstar-the-advent-of-on-screen-voice-credits/|accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Voice work for Hanna-Barbera and others===
In 1960, after the expiration of his exclusive contract with Warner Bros., Blanc continued working for WB, but also began providing voices for the TV cartoons produced by [[Hanna-Barbera]]; his most famous roles during this time were Barney Rubble of ''The Flintstones'' and [[List of The Jetsons characters#Mr. Spacely|Cosmo Spacely]] of ''The Jetsons''. His other voice roles for Hanna-Barbera included [[Dino (The Flintstones)|Dino the Dinosaur]], [[Secret Squirrel]], [[Speed Buggy]], and [[Captain Caveman and the Teen Angels|Captain Caveman]], as well as voices for ''[[Wally Gator]]'' and ''[[The Perils of Penelope Pitstop]].''

Blanc also worked with former "Looney Tunes" director Chuck Jones, who by this time was directing shorts with his own company Sib Tower 12 (later [[MGM Animation/Visual Arts]]); doing vocal effects for the ''[[Tom and Jerry]]'' series from 1963 to 1967. Blanc was the first voice of [[Toucan Sam]] in [[Froot Loops]] commercials.

Blanc reprised some of his Warner Bros. characters when the studio contracted him to make [[DePatie-Freleng Enterprises|new theatrical cartoons]] in the mid-to-late 1960s. For these, Blanc voiced Daffy Duck and Speedy Gonzales, the characters who received the most frequent use in these shorts (later, newly introduced characters such as Cool Cat and Merlin the Magic Mouse were voiced by [[Larry Storch]]). Blanc also continued to voice the "Looney Tunes" for the bridging sequences of ''[[The Bugs Bunny Show]]'', as well as in numerous animated advertisements and several compilation features, such as ''[[The Bugs Bunny/Road Runner Movie]]'' (1979). He also voiced [[Granny (Looney Tunes)|Granny]] in ''Bugs Bunny’s High-Fructose Christmas Record'' (in place of [[June Foray]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cartoonresearch.com/index.php/bugs-bunnys-high-fructose-christmas-record/|title=Bugs Bunny’s High-Fructose Christmas Record {{!}}|website=cartoonresearch.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Car accident and aftermath===
On January 24, 1961, Blanc was involved in a near-fatal car accident. He was driving alone when his sports car [[head-on collision|collided head-on]] with a car driven by 18-year-old college student Arthur Rolston on [[Sunset Boulevard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last= |first= |date=January 25, 1961 |title=Mel Blanc, Man of Many Voices, Badly Injured |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/7806040// |newspaper=The Terre Haute Tribune |location=Terre Haute, IN |agency=[[United Press International|UPI]] |via=[[Newspapers.com]] |accessdate=December 10, 2016 }} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rolston suffered minor injuries, but Blanc was rushed to the [[UCLA Medical Center]] with a triple skull fracture that left him in a coma for two weeks, along with sustaining fractures to both legs and the pelvis.&lt;ref name="bio"&gt;''That's Not All, Folks!'', 1988, by Mel Blanc and Philip Bashe.

Four days later, Blanc filed a US$500,000 lawsuit against the city of Los Angeles. His accident, one of 26 in the preceding two years at the intersection known as [[Dead Man's Curve#Other sharp curves|Dead Man's Curve]], resulted in the city funding the restructuring of curves at the location.

Years later, Blanc revealed that during his recovery, his son [[Noel Blanc|Noel]] "ghosted" several Warner Bros. cartoons' voice tracks for him. Warner Bros. had also asked [[Stan Freberg]] to provide the voice for Bugs Bunny, but Freberg declined, out of respect for Blanc. At the time of the accident, Blanc was also serving as the voice of Barney Rubble in ''The Flintstones''. His absence from the show was relatively brief; [[Daws Butler]] provided the voice of Barney for a few episodes, after which the show's producers set up recording equipment in Blanc's hospital room and later at his home to allow him to work from there. Some of the recordings were made while he was in full-body cast as he lay flat on his back with the other ''Flintstones'' co-stars gathered around him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1828&amp;dat=19880904&amp;id=EsMnAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=cL4EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1214,1135635|title="Blanc laments lack of cartoon quality"|publisher=|accessdate=November 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also returned to ''The Jack Benny Program'' to film the program's 1961 Christmas show, moving around by crutches and a wheelchair.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last= |first= |date=November 24, 1961 |title=Mel Blanc Is Back at Work |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/7812606// |newspaper=The Vernon Daily Record |location=Vernon, TX |agency=[[Associated Press|AP]] |via=[[Newspapers.com]] |accessdate=December 11, 2016 }} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later career==
In the 1970s, Blanc gave a series of college lectures across the US and appeared in commercials for [[American Express]]. Mel’s production company, Blanc Communications Corporation, collaborated on a special with the Boston-based Shriners Burns Institute called ''Ounce of Prevention,'' which became a 30-minute TV special.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://library.nfpa.org/surpass/websafari.exe/detail?sid=84E152E6-849C-449D-AB27-22DA2C07555B&amp;database=database&amp;list=R&amp;rec=29&amp;marc=9208|title=Ounce of prevention|accessdate=October 8, 2017|website=Charles S. Morgan Technical Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the 1980s, Blanc performed his [[Looney Tunes]] characters for bridging sequences in various compilation films of [[Golden age of American animation|Golden-Age-era]] Warner Bros. cartoons, such as ''[[The Looney Looney Looney Bugs Bunny Movie]]'', ''[[Bugs Bunny's 3rd Movie: 1001 Rabbit Tales]]'', ''[[Daffy Duck's Fantastic Island]]'', and ''[[Daffy Duck's Quackbusters]]''. His final performance of his "Looney Tunes" roles was in ''Bugs Bunny's Wild World of Sports'' (1989). After spending most of two seasons voicing the diminutive robot Twiki in ''[[Buck Rogers in the 25th Century (TV series)|Buck Rogers in the 25th Century]],'' Blanc's last original character was [[Heathcliff (comic strip)|Heathcliff]], in the early 1980s.

In the 1983 live-action film ''[[Strange Brew]]'', Blanc voiced the father of [[Bob and Doug MacKenzie]], at the request of comedian [[Rick Moranis]].

In the 1988 live-action/animated movie ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]],'' Blanc reprised several of his classic "Looney Tunes" roles (Bugs, Daffy, Porky, Tweety, and Sylvester), but left Yosemite Sam to [[Joe Alaskey]] (who later became one of Blanc's regular replacements until his death in 2016).  The film was one of the few [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] projects Blanc was involved in. Blanc died just a year after the film's release. His final recording session was for ''[[Jetsons: The Movie]]'' (1990).&lt;ref&gt;[[Jerry Beck|Beck, Jerry]]. ''The Animated Movie Guide'' (2005).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1962, Mel and his son Noel formed Blanc Communications Corporation,&lt;ref name="Banc_Bio"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Blanc | first = Mel.| year = 1988 | title = That's not all Folks!| publisher = Warner Books| isbn = 0-446-51244-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|228, 252}} a media company which remains in operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.melblanccommunications.com/|title=Blanc Communications Corporation official site|accessdate=October 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mel and his son Noel produced over 5000 public service announcements and commercials, appearing with [[Kirk Douglas]], [[Lucille Ball]], [[Vincent Price]], [[Phyllis Diller]], [[Liberace]], and [[The Who]].

==Death==
[[File:Mel Blanc 4-15-05.JPG|thumb|Blanc's gravesite marker]]
&lt;!-- Please seek consensus at the Talk page before editing the Death section and adding reasons other than emphysema and heart disease --&gt;
Blanc began [[Tobacco smoking|smoking cigarettes]] when he was nine years old. He continued his pack-a-day habit until he was diagnosed with [[Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease|emphysema]], which pushed him to quit at age 77.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mel Blanc: His Voice Is His Fortune|first=Aljean|last=Harmetz|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1988-11-27/features/8803090392_1_noel-blanc-mel-blanc-bugs-bunny|date=November 27, 1988|work=[[Sun-Sentinel]]|publisher=[[Tribune Company]]|accessdate=July 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 19, 1989, Blanc was checked into [[Cedars-Sinai Medical Center]] in Los Angeles by his family &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://onefoggy.tripod.com/blancobit.html|title= Mel Blanc - Obituary|publisher=|accessdate=November 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; when they noticed he had a bad cough while shooting a commercial; he was originally expected to recover. Blanc's health then took a turn for the worse and doctors found that he had advanced [[coronary artery disease]]. He died on July 10 at Cedars-Sinai, at the age of 81.&lt;ref name=NYTobit/&gt; He is interred in [[Hollywood Forever Cemetery]] in Hollywood. Blanc's will stated his desire to have the inscription on his gravestone read, "THAT'S ALL FOLKS," the phrase that was the hallmark of Blanc's character, Porky Pig.

==Legacy==
Blanc is regarded as the most prolific voice actor in the history of the industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yImkNboc4tsC&amp;pg=PA217 |page=217 |title=Raised by the Stars: Interviews with 29 Children of Hollywood Actors |last=Thomas |first=Nick |publisher=McFarland |year=2011 |isbn=0786464038}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the first voice actor to receive on-screen credit.&lt;ref name="Blanc"/&gt;

Blanc's death was considered a significant loss to the cartoon industry because of his skill, expressive range, and sheer volume of continuing characters he portrayed, which are currently taken up by several other voice talents. Indeed, as movie critic [[Leonard Maltin]] once pointed out, "It is astounding to realize that Tweety Bird and Yosemite Sam are the same man!"

According to Blanc, Sylvester the Cat was the easiest character to voice because "It's just my normal speaking voice with a spray at the end." Yosemite Sam was the hardest because of his loudness and raspiness.&lt;ref name="Blanc"/&gt;

A doctor who once examined Blanc's throat found that he possessed unusually thick, powerful vocal cords that gave him an exceptional range. The doctor reported that they rivaled those of opera singer [[Enrico Caruso]].&lt;ref name="Blanc"/&gt;

After his death, Blanc's voice continued to be heard in newly released productions, such as recordings of Dino the Dinosaur in the live-action films ''[[The Flintstones (film)|The Flintstones]]'' (1994) and ''[[The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas]]'' (2000). Similarly, recordings of Blanc as Jack Benny's Maxwell were featured in ''[[Looney Tunes: Back in Action]]'' (2003). More recently, archive recordings of Blanc have been featured in new [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]]-animated "Looney Tunes" theatrical shorts; ''[[I Tawt I Taw a Puddy Tat]]'' (shown with ''[[Happy Feet Two]]'') and ''[[Daffy's Rhapsody]]'' (shown with ''[[Journey 2: The Mysterious Island]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=78492 |title=More 3D Looney Tunes Shorts On The Way |publisher=ComingSoon.net |date= |accessdate=October 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Vary |first=Adam B. |url=http://insidemovies.ew.com/2011/11/14/tweety-bird-sylvester-looney-tunes-clip-exclusive/#more-53075 |title=Looney Tunes short with Tweety Bird, Sylvester - EXCLUSIVE CLIP|work=Entertainment Weekly |date= |accessdate=October 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Blanc trained his son Noel in the field of voice characterization. Although the younger Blanc has performed his father's characters (particularly Porky Pig) on some programs, he has chosen not to become a full-time voice artist.

For his contributions to the radio industry, Mel Blanc has a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] at 6385 [[Hollywood Boulevard]]. His character Bugs Bunny also has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame (the only others to have received this honor are [[Walt Disney]] as both himself and [[Mickey Mouse]], [[Jim Henson]] as both himself and [[Kermit the Frog]], and [[Mike Myers]] as both himself and [[Shrek (character)|Shrek]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bugs Bunny|url=http://www.walkoffame.com/bugs-bunny|publisher=Hollywood Chamber of Commerce|accessdate=June 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Welsh mythology]], '''Olwen''' (or '''Olwyn''') is the daughter of the giant [[Ysbaddaden]] and cousin of [[Goreu fab Custennin|Goreu]]. She is the heroine of the story ''[[Culhwch and Olwen]]'' in the [[Mabinogion]]. Her father is fated to die if she ever marries, so when [[Culhwch]] (sometimes spelled as Kilhwch) comes to court her, he is given a series of immensely difficult tasks which he must complete before he can win her hand. With the help of his cousin [[King Arthur]], Culhwch succeeds and the giant dies, allowing Olwen to marry her suitor.

The name "Olwen" reappears in the non-Arthurian [[Folklore|folktale]] ''Einion and Olwen'', about a sheep herder who travels to the [[Otherworld]] to marry Olwen; they later have a son named [[Taliesin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3gaBAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA384|title=The Arthurian Name Dictionary|first=Christopher W.|last=Bruce|date=21 August 2013|publisher=Routledge|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/celt/ffcc/ffcc124.htm|title=The Fairy-Faith in Celtic Countries: Section I: The Living Fairy-Faith: Chapter II. Taking of Evidence: V. In Wales|website=www.sacred-texts.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tale was collected at the turn of the 20th century but is related to ''Culhwch and Olwen''.

The meaning of the name Olwen is "white footprint".&lt;ref&gt;"Welsh ''ol'' "footprint, track" and ''gwen'' "white, fair, blessed"", cited from http://www.behindthename.com/name/olwen&lt;/ref&gt; According to legend, she was so gentle and fragile that white [[lilies]] would grow in her footprints. Some authorities consider her to have been originally a [[solar goddess]], based on the etymology of her name and light-related attributes.&lt;ref&gt;Simon Andrew Stirling, The Grail: Relic of an Ancient Religion, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Patricia Monaghan, The Encyclopedia of Celtic Mythology and Folklore, page 433.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9733">'''Paul Adriaan Jan, Baron Janssen''' (12 September 1926, [[Turnhout]] – 11 November 2003, [[Rome]]) was a Belgian doctor. He was the founder of [[Janssen Pharmaceutica]], a pharmaceutical company with over 20,000 employees.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Lewi, Obituary of Dr Paul Janssen (1926–2003), Drug Discovery Today, Volume 9, Issue 10, 15 May 2004, Pages 432–433&lt;/ref&gt;

==Birth and education==
Paul Janssen was the son of [[Constant Janssen]] and Margriet Fleerackers. On 16 April 1957, he married Dora Arts.

He attended secondary school at the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] St Jozef college in Turnhout, after which he decided to follow in his father's footsteps and become a doctor. During World War II, Janssen studied physics, biology and chemistry at the [[Facultés universitaires Notre-Dame de la Paix]] (FUNDP) in [[Namur (city)|Namur]]. He then studied medicine at the [[Catholic University of Leuven (1834–1968)|Catholic University of Leuven]] and the [[University of Ghent]]. In 1951, Janssen graduated in medicine from the University of Ghent.

==Career==
During his military service, he worked at the [[University of Cologne]] in Germany at the Institute of Pharmacology of J. Schuller, where he worked until 1952. After he returned to Belgium he worked part-time at the Institute of Pharmacology and Therapeutics (University of Ghent) of Professor [[Corneille Heymans]], who had won the [[Nobel Prize]] for medicine in 1938. Janssen founded his own research laboratory in 1953, with a loan of 50,000 Belgian [[francs]] from his father. In 1953 he also discovered his first drug [[ambucetamide]], an [[antispasmodic]] found to be particularly effective for the relief of [[menstrual]] pain.&lt;ref&gt;I. Oransky, Paul Janssen, The Lancet, Volume 363, Issue 9404, Pages 251–251&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Beerse Statue Paul Janssen 070225.JPG|thumb|200px|right|Statue of Dr. Paul Janssen in [[Beerse]], Belgium]]In 1956, Janssen received his teaching certificate for higher education in pharmacology (the [[habilitation]] and the official ''pro venia legendi'' (Latin, ''for permission to lecture'')) with a thesis on ''Compounds of the R 79 type''. He then left the university and in 1956 established the company which would become ''Janssen Pharmaceutica''. On 11 February 1958 he made [[haloperidol]] a major breakthrough in the treatment of [[schizophrenia]].&lt;ref&gt;B. Granger, S. Albu, The Haloperidol Story, Annals of Clinical Psychiatry (after 1 Jan 2004), Volume 17, Number 3, Number 3/July–September 2005, pp. 137–140(4)&lt;/ref&gt; Paul Janssen and his team developed the [[fentanyl]] family of drugs, and many other anesthesia-related drugs, such as [[droperidol]] and [[etomidate]] which made a significant contribution to [[anesthesiology]].&lt;ref name=Stanley2008&gt;{{cite journal

Janssen and the scientists at [[Janssen Pharmaceutica]] discovered more than 80 new medicines. Four of his medicines are on the [[WHO list of essential medicines]]; this is an absolute world record. The majority of the drugs he and his teams developed were for human medicine and are being used to treat infestations by fungi and worms, [[mental illnesses]], [[cardiovascular]] diseases, [[allergy|allergies]], and [[gastrointestinal disorder]]s.

==Death==
Paul Janssen died in Rome, Italy, in 2003, while attending the celebration of the 400th anniversary of the founding of the [[Pontifical Academy of Sciences]], of which he had been a member since 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Neuropsychopharmacology |url=http://www.nature.com/npp/journal/v29/n8/full/1300423a.html |title=Thomas A Ban, Paul Adriaan Jan Janssen, 1926–2003, Neuropsychopharmacology (2004) 29, 1579–1580 |publisher=Nature.com |date= |accessdate=2012-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was survived by his widow, Dora Arts Janssen, two sons, three daughters and 13 grandchildren.

==Popularity polls==
*In 2005 he finished as runner up, after [[Father Damien]], in the poll for [[De Grootste Belg|The Greatest Belgian]] organized by the regional [[Flanders|Flemish]] television.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=De Grootste Belg|url=http://www.standaard.be/kanaal/index.aspx?kanaalid=54|accessdate=4 October 2011|newspaper=De Standaard|language=Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6574">[[Image:Pierre Taittinger.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Taittinger in 1929.]]
'''Pierre-Charles Taittinger''' (4 October 1887 &amp;ndash; 22 January 1965) was the founder of the [[Taittinger family|Taittinger champagne house]] and chairman of the municipal council of Paris in 1943&amp;ndash;1944 during the [[German occupation of France during World War II|German occupation of France]], in which position he played a role during the [[Liberation of Paris]].

==Personal life==
Born in Paris, Pierre Taittinger's family were originally from [[Lorraine (province)|Lorraine]] and had left the [[Moselle]] ''[[département in France|département]]'' when it had been annexed by the [[German Empire]] in 1871 in order to remain French citizens. An officer in the cavalry during the First World War, Taittinger received several citations and was decorated with the ''[[Légion d'honneur]]''. In 1919 he was elected [[French National Assembly|deputy]] of the [[Charente-Inférieure]] département.

Taittinger married Gabrielle Guillet (1893–1924) in 1917. In 1925, he married Anne-Marie Mailly (1887–1986). He died in Paris in 1965 and was buried in Reims at the ''cimetière du Nord'' with his third son [[François Taittinger|François]] (1921–1960) who had run the Taittinger champagne house between 1945 and 1960.

His son Michel, a French military hero and second lieutenant in the 66th African Artillery Regiment of the French Army, died on 15 June 1940 at the age of 20 in the city of Saint Parres-aux-Tertres, near Troyes in the Champagne region. He had held off for five hours a Panzer division of General von Kleist with his fellow soldiers, many of whom were of Moroccan, Algerian and West African units. Michel had been a student in the French military academy Ecole Polytechnique.

Another of Taittinger's sons, [[Jean Taittinger]], was deputy mayor of Reims from 1959 to 1977, Secretary of State for Budget from 1971 to 1973 and State Minister of Justice from 1973 to 1974 in the administration of [[Georges Pompidou]].

==Political career==
He was mayor of [[Saint-Georges-des-Coteaux]], in the same département, from 1919 until 1937, and again from 1953 until his death in 1965. In 1924 he was elected deputy of the [[1st arrondissement of Paris]], and held this mandate until 1940.

In 1924, Taittinger founded the ''[[Jeunesses Patriotes|Jeunesses patriotes]]'' (Patriotic Youths), a right-wing group, recruited mostly from university students and financed by industrialists. Taittinger took inspiration for the group's creation in the [[Boulangist]] ''[[Ligue des Patriotes|Ligue des patriotes]]''. Taittinger was also deeply influenced by the Bonapartist movement, during which he was a member of the French Parliament. In the end of the 1920s, the ''Jeunesses patriotes'' became one of the far-right's major anti-Communist movements, challenging the ''[[Action Française|Action française]]'' and the Croix de Feu under Colonel de Laroque.

In 1937, he was elected to the municipal council of Paris and to the departmental council of the [[Seine (département)|Seine]]. In March 1940, he was elevated to the rank of Commander in the Order of the ''Légion d'honneur''. He became president of the municipal council of Paris in May 1943, as the Germans occupied the city, and held this position until the Liberation of Paris in August 1944.

On August 17, 1944, concerned that explosives were being placed at strategic points around Paris by the Germans, Taittinger met with the German military governor [[Dietrich von Choltitz]]. On being told that Choltitz intended to slow up as much as possible the Allied advance, Taittinger, along with the Swedish consul general [[Raoul Nordling]], attempted to persuade Choltitz not to destroy Paris. As the Allies rolled into the Paris Basin, Pierre Taittinger made an incredible change from collaborator to a member of the resistance. After the war, he published a book called ''...et Paris ne fut pas détruit'' ("...and Paris was not destroyed") which was awarded a prize by the [[Académie française|French Academy]]. In 1954 he became honorary deputy (a title given to ex-members of the [[French National Assembly]]).

==Champagne business==
Taittinger, who, before the First World War, had run a business involved in the distribution and export of  [[Champagne (wine)|champagne]] with one of his brothers-in-law, acquired in 1931 the venerable champagne firm of Forest-Fourneaux, founded in 1734 by [[Jacques Fourneaux]] and the third oldest champagne house in existence. The next year he bought the [[Château de la Marquetterie]] and its champagne estate, near [[Épernay]], which he had first visited during the war while stationed in the area. In the following years, he bought hundreds of acres of vineyards in the finest producing areas of Champagne, taking advantage of the cheap price of land caused by the 1930s economic crisis.

Forest-Fourneaux, renamed Ets Taittinger Mailly &amp; Cie, was transformed by Taittinger into a world-famous champagne house, Champagne Taittinger, operating from the cellars of the Saint-Nicaise Abbey in [[Reims]]. Pierre Taittinger restored the House of the Counts of Champagne in the center of Reims, damaged by the Germans during the First World War, which had been the residence of the [[Count of Champagne|Counts of Champagne]] during the Middle Ages, now the property of Champagne Taittinger. He bequeathed  his estate of La Grainetière, on the [[Île de Ré|Isle of Rhé]], to the city of Reims, which has become a summer camp for the children of Reims.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5568">The '''religious views of Samuel Johnson''' are expressed in both his moralistic writings and his sermons.

==Moralistic writings==
[[Samuel Johnson]] regarded himself as a moralist during his career between 1748 and 1760. Although Johnson wrote a poem, many essays, and a short novel, all of these works are connected by a common intent and each relates to others. The works during this period cannot be separated without disregarding Johnson's major ideas and themes.&lt;ref name="Bate p. 296"&gt;Bate p. 296&lt;/ref&gt;

As David Greene points out, Johnson's moral writings contain no "predetermined and authorized pattern of 'good behavior,'" although they do emphasize certain kinds of conduct.&lt;ref name="Greene p. 87"&gt;Greene p. 87&lt;/ref&gt; To be moral, in Johnson's view, an individual must always be self-aware and self-critical.&lt;ref name="Greene p. 87"/&gt;  Johnson respected committed Christians of other denominations than his own High Church Anglicanism. {{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}. His aversion to Milton's politics entails no attack Milton's religious beliefs. He defended [[Thomas Browne]] by saying, in his ''Life of Browne'':&lt;ref&gt;Greene p. 88&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Men may differ from each other in many religious opinions, and yet all may retain the essentials of Christianity; men may sometimes eagerly dispute, and yet not differ much from one another: the rigorous prosecutors of error should, therefore, enlighten their zeal with knowledge, and temper their orthodoxy with charity; that charity without which orthodoxy is vain.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
He attacks other religions or their adherents on the grounds that they betray Christ's teachings.&lt;ref&gt;Greene p. 89&lt;/ref&gt; This is not to say that Johnson was passive in his religious observance; instead, he was an 18th-century evangelical, which, as he defines in his ''Dictionary'', means "Agreeable to gospel; consonant to the Christian law contained in the holy gospel".&lt;ref&gt;Greene p. 90&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Vanity of Human Wishes===
{{main|The Vanity of Human Wishes}}
''The Vanity of Human Wishes'' is a sort of prologue to Johnson's career as a moralist.&lt;ref name="Bate p. 296"/&gt;

===The Rambler===
{{main|The Rambler}}

===The Idler===
{{main|The Idler (1758–1760)}}

===Rasselas===
{{main|The History of Rasselas, Prince of Abissinia}}
''Rasselas'' is a sort of epilogue to Johnson's career as a moralist.&lt;ref name="Bate p. 296"/&gt;

==Sermons==
Johnson's sermons, according to David Greene, are "a neglected but important and rewarding section of his writings".&lt;ref&gt;Greene p. 92&lt;/ref&gt; They are dry and formally organized because Johnson did not approve of the emotionally charged rhetoric of 17th century preachers at the pulpit.&lt;ref&gt;Greene p. 93&lt;/ref&gt; Christian religion and ethics are the primary topic of the sermons with emphasis on marriage, repentance, hardening the heart, charity, pride, wisdom, and compassion. Sometimes Johnson discussed theological topics like the nature of God or political topics like morality's role in governmental action.&lt;ref&gt;Greene pp. 94–95&lt;/ref&gt;

==Views==
Johnson was a rationalist and believed that rational thought was vital to morality.

===On poverty===
In his review of [[Soame Jenyns]]'s ''A Free Enquiry into the Nature and Origin of Evil'' and its argument that those "born to poverty" should not be educated so they could enjoy the "opiate of ignorance", Johnson wrote, "To entail irreversible poverty upon generation after generation only because the ancestor happened to be poor, is, in itself, cruel, if not unjust".&lt;ref name="Green p. 97"&gt;Greene p. 97&lt;/ref&gt;

===On madness===
When Jenyns claimed that madness was a way God ensured that the poor would be content with life, Johnson responded:
&lt;blockquote&gt;On the happiness of madmen, as the case is not very frequent, it is not necessary to raise a disquisition, but I cannot forbear to observe that I never yet knew disorders of mind increase felicity; every madman is either arrogant and irascible, or gloomy and suspicious, or possessed by some passion or notion destructive to his quiet. He has always discontent in his look, and malignity in his bosom. And, if we had the power of choice, he would soon repent who should resign his reason to secure his peace.&lt;ref name="Green p. 97"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===On education===
Johnson responds to Jenyns's final argument, that the ends justify the means when it comes to keeping the poor uneducated, by saying:
&lt;blockquote&gt;I am always afraid of determining on the side of envy or cruelty. The privileges of education may sometimes be improperly bestowed, but I shall always fear to withhold them lest I should be yielding to the suggestions of pride, while I persuade myself that I am following the maxims of policy; and under the appearance of salutary restraints, should be indulging the lust of dominion, and that malevolence which delights in seeing others depressed.&lt;ref&gt;Greene p. 98&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===On slavery===
At Oxford Johnson gave a toast and said, "Here's to the next insurrection of the Negroes in the West Indies".&lt;ref&gt;Boswell p. 200&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sidney Darlington''' (July 18, 1906 &amp;ndash; October 31, 1997) was an electrical engineer and inventor of a [[transistor]] configuration in 1953, the [[Darlington transistor|Darlington pair]]. He advanced the state of [[network theory]], developing the insertion-loss synthesis approach, and invented [[pulse compression|chirp radar]], [[bombsight]]s, and gun and rocket [[Guidance system|guidance]].

Darlington was awarded a B.S. in Physics, Magna Cum Laude, from Harvard in 1928 where he was elected to [[Phi Beta Kappa]]. He also received a B.S. in E.E. from MIT in 1929, and a Ph.D. in Physics from Columbia in 1940.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ieeeghn.org/wiki/index.php/Sidney_Darlington&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1945, he was awarded the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]], the United States' highest civilian honor, for his contributions during World War II. He was an elected member of the [[National Academy of Engineering]], which cited his contributions to electrical network theory, radar, and guidance systems. In 1975, he received [[IEEE]]'s [[Edison Medal]] "For basic contributions to network theory and for important inventions in radar systems and electronic circuits" and the [[IEEE Medal of Honor]] in 1981 "For fundamental contributions to filtering and signal processing leading to chirp radar".

He died at his home in [[Exeter, New Hampshire]], USA, at the age of 91.

'''Suna Kıraç''' (born '''Suna Koç''' on June 3, 1941) is a [[Turkish people|Turkish]] businesswoman and a billionaire.&lt;ref name="f"/&gt;

==Early years==
Suna Koç was born to [[Vehbi Koç]] (1901-1996), the wealthiest businessman of Turkey, and his wife Sadberk (1908–1973) on June 3, 1941. She is the vice president of the [[Koç Holding]]. She married to İnan Kıraç, then a high-level executive of the Koç Holding. As they were unable to have a baby, they adopted a four-month old baby girl named İpek in their 15th marriage year.&lt;ref name="h1"/&gt;

==Illness==
She experienced the first symptoms of her illness shortly after her father's death and her involvement in the family business. In 1996, she suffered [[aphonia]]. The next year, her hands began to fall asleep, and one year later, she began to lisp. She was diagnosed [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]] (ALS), a specific disease that causes the death of neurons which control voluntary muscles, in the [[Houston Methodist Hospital]].

Kıraç was paralyzed throughout her entire body in 2000. She can not make any movement, walk, or talk, and she communicates only by eye movement. When she wants to express a will, she winks for the right letter on a Turkish alphabet show card.

==Museum==
Suna and Kıraç established a foundation for culture and education. The foundation opened the [[Pera Museum]] in 2005, which exhibits three valuable art collections of Kıraç Family.&lt;ref name="s1"/&gt;

== Awards ==
Suna Kıraç was awarded the [[State Medal of Distinguished Service]] by the Turkish Council of Ministers for her contributions to education, health and social services in the country on 23 September 1997. She received the award from President [[Süleyman Demirel]] on 27 October 1997.

In 2008, she was awarded an honorary doctorate degree from the [[Boğaziçi University]] for her contribution to education.&lt;ref name="h2"/&gt;

==Autobiography==
In 1998, she published an autobiography, in which she wrote her life, her marriage, how she adopted her daughter İpek, her professional years, her illness and her dreams.&lt;ref name="h1"/&gt;

==Early years==
Roberts, alternately nicknamed "Tec" and "Tex", was born 10 October 1925 at Trefnant Bach cottage in [[Llanddaniel Fab]], [[Anglesey]], [[Wales]]. He received his early education  at ''Ysgol Parc y Bont'', the small local [[primary school]] there. He left the school in 1938 after a successful [[Scholarship Examination]] and continued his studies at the [[Beaumaris Grammar School]], from which he graduated in 1942.&lt;ref name="Tecwynearly"&gt;[http://www.llanddaniel.co.uk/Tecwyn_early_years.html "Roberts’ early years in Llanddaniel."] ''llanddaniel.co.uk.'' Retrieved: 5 May 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; After leaving Beaumaris Grammar School, he began an engineering [[apprenticeship]] with the  aero- and marine-engineering company [[Saunders-Roe]] at Fryars Bay, [[Llanfaes]], Anglesey, some eight miles from Llanddaniel Fab.&lt;ref name="Saunders-Roe"&gt;[http://www.llanddaniel.co.uk/saunders_roe_beaumaris.html "Roberts’ Engineering Apprenticeship with Saunders-Roe."] ''llanddaniel.co.uk.''

==Aerospace career==

===United Kingdom===
After serving briefly in the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF), Roberts was released in 1944 and resumed work with Saunders-Roe at their [[Southampton]] works, from where he was transferred to the [[Isle of Wight]] in 1946. At that time, he also attended the [[University of Southampton]] where he obtained a degree in [[Aeronautical Engineering]] in 1948 and was awarded the [[Institute of Mechanical Engineers]] Special Award. Whilst working for Saunders-Roe on the Isle of Wight, Roberts met Doris Sprake whom he later married.&lt;ref name="degree"&gt;[http://www.llanddaniel.co.uk/saunders_roe_isle_of_white.html "Roberts’ in Southampton and the Isle."] ''llanddaniel.co.uk.''

===Canada===
In December 1952, Roberts and his wife left England for [[Canada]] to take up a position with the [[aircraft manufacturer|aircraft manufacturing]] company [[A.V. Roe and Company|Avro Canada]] near [[Toronto]].&lt;ref&gt;Gainor 2001, pp. 44–45.&lt;/ref&gt; From 1952 to 1959, he was a member of the engineering team that developed the [[Avro Canada CF-105 Arrow|CF-105 Arrow]],&lt;ref&gt;Whitcomb 2001, p. 214.&lt;/ref&gt; a highly advanced [[delta-wing]]ed [[interceptor aircraft]].&lt;ref name="avro"&gt;[http://www.llanddaniel.co.uk/avro_canada.html "Roberts’ with Avro Canada."] ''llanddaniel.co.uk.''

===United States===

====Langley Research Center====
Created in November 1958, the [[Space Task Group]] under the leadership of [[Robert Gilruth]] was tasked with superintending America's [[manned spaceflight]] program, [[Project Mercury]], having been given the responsibility of placing a man in orbit around the Earth. Of its original 37 engineers, 27 were from [[Langley Research Center]] and 10 had been assigned from [[Lewis Research Center]] in [[Cleveland, Ohio]]. In 1959, Gilruth's group was greatly expanded by the addition of the engineers from Canada who had been left without jobs when the Avro Arrow project was cancelled.&lt;ref name="SpaceTaskGroup"&gt;[http://www.llanddaniel.co.uk/space_task_group.html "Roberts in America's Space Task Group."] ''llanddaniel.co.uk.''

In 1962, Roberts was appointed head of the Mission Control Center Requirements Branch,&lt;ref name="thoughts"/&gt; as which he played a key role in the design and further development of the Mercury Control Center at [[Cape Kennedy]] and also at the subsequent [[Mission Control Center]] at the Manned Spacecraft Center (later [[Johnson Space Center]]) in [[Houston, Texas]],&lt;ref name="mercury"/&gt; where NASA's manned spaceflight program had been transferred in 1961. NASA's concept of [[Mission Control]] had previously been developed under the leadership of [[Christopher C. Kraft, Jr.|Christopher C. Kraft]]. When Roberts assumed his new position, [[Glynn Lunney]] succeeded him as Flight Dynamics Officer. As head of the Mission Control Center Requirements Branch, he was assigned responsibilities for determination, coordination and implementation of all design requirements for the construction of the new Mission Control Center in Houston. For his accomplishments in that area, Roberts received the NASA Outstanding Achievement Award.&lt;ref name="obituary"/&gt;

On 21 May 1962, Roberts was appointed head of Manned Flight Division at the [[Goddard Space Flight Center]] in [[Greenbelt, Maryland]].&lt;ref name="mercury"/&gt; At that time, Roberts and his wife also resided in Maryland. Their only child, Michael (born about 1960), attended [[Archbishop Spalding High School|Spalding High School]] in [[Severn, Maryland]].&lt;ref name="mercury"/&gt;

====Goddard Space Flight Center====
In July 1964, Roberts became Technical Assistant to the Deputy Assistant Director of Tracking and Data systems at Goddard Space Flight Center,&lt;ref name="obituary"/&gt; and chief of the Manned Flight Engineering Division.&lt;ref name="Network"/&gt; This put Roberts in charge of NASA's [[Manned Space Flight Network]], a set of [[tracking station]]s built to support the American space efforts of [[Project Mercury|Mercury]], [[Project Gemini|Gemini]], [[Apollo program|Apollo]] and [[Skylab]]. There were two other space communication networks at this time, the [[Spacecraft Tracking and Data Acquisition Network]] (STADAN) for tracking unmanned satellites in low Earth orbit, and the [[Deep Space Network]] (DSN) for tracking more distant unmanned missions.

[[File:Apollo Road in Tennent, ACT.jpg|thumb|right|Apollo Road - The road to Honeysuckle Creek.]]
Roberts became chief of the Manned Flight Support Division at the Goddard Space Flight Center during the [[Apollo Program]] in 1965. To support the Apollo program, Goddard commissioned three 85&amp;nbsp;ft, (26 m) antennas that would be equally spaced around the world. These were in Madrid (Spain), [[Goldstone Deep Space Communications Complex|Goldstone in California (USA)]] and at [[Honeysuckle Creek Tracking Station|Honeysuckle Creek]] in Australia. Roberts was present when the [[Honeysuckle Creek Tracking Station]] was opened by Australian Prime Minister [[Harold Holt]] on 17 March 1967.&lt;ref name="Honeysuckle"&gt;[http://www.llanddaniel.co.uk/Honeysuckle_creek.html "Roberts at the Opening of Honeysuckle Creek Tracking Station."] ''llanddaniel.co.uk.''

Later in 1967, Roberts became Chief of the Network Engineering Division,&lt;ref name="thoughts"/&gt; which he headed during the first [[landing on the moon]]. In 1969, he received the [[NASA Exceptional Service Medal]] for his work in support of the [[Apollo 8]] flight.&lt;ref name="obituary"/&gt; In 1972,&lt;ref name="thoughts"/&gt; Roberts became Director of Networks at the Goddard Space Flight Center,&lt;ref name="Network"/&gt; a position he still held by the time of the [[Apollo–Soyuz Test Project]] in July 1975. His chief responsibility in this role was to ensure that contact was maintained between the orbiting [[United States|U.S.]] and [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] spacecraft. This was to be his last direct involvement with NASA's manned space flights.

In 1976, Roberts and Robert S. Cooper, the Director of the Goddard Space Flight Center, were elected Fellows of the [[American Astronautical Society]].&lt;ref name="Network"&gt;[http://www.llanddaniel.co.uk/network_engineering_division.html "Roberts at the Network Engineering Division."] ''llanddaniel.co.uk.''

==Retirement and death==
In 1979, Roberts retired as Director of Networks at Goddard and from NASA and became a consultant to the Bendix Field Engineering Corporation.&lt;ref name="obituary"/&gt;

On 26 November 1984, the Goddard Space Center honoured a group of 34 individuals including Roberts with the Robert H. Goddard Award of Merit, the highest level of recognition the Goddard Space Center can bestow on its employees.&lt;ref name="TDRS"&gt;[http://www.llanddaniel.co.uk/tecwyn_retirement.html "Roberts at the Network Engineering Division."] ''llanddaniel.co.uk.''

The '''Wabanaki Confederacy''' (''Wabenaki, Wobanaki'', translated roughly as "People of the First Light" or "People of the Dawnland") are a [[First Nations]] and [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] confederation of five principal nations: the [[Mi'kmaq]], [[Maliseet]], [[Passamaquoddy]], [[Abenaki]], and [[Penobscot]].

Members of the Wabanaki Confederacy, the '''Wabanaki peoples''', are in and named for the area which they call ''Wabanahkik'' ("Dawnland"), generally known to [[Europe|European]] settlers as [[Acadia]]. It is made up of most of present-day [[Maine]] in the United States, and [[New Brunswick]], mainland [[Nova Scotia]], [[Cape Breton Island]], [[Prince Edward Island]] and some of [[Quebec]] south of the [[St. Lawrence River]] in Canada. The Western Abenaki live on lands in [[New Hampshire]], [[Vermont]], and [[Massachusetts]] of the United States.&lt;ref name="ICT"&gt;Toensing, Gale Courey.  [http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/node/93141 "Sacred fire lights the Wabanaki Confederacy"]{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, ''Indian Country Today'' (June 27, 2008), ICT Media Network&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent official statements, the Confederacy has emphasized common cause with, and acceptance of, alliances with environmental activists toward the goal of protecting their land and waters.  They gained powers under the United Nations 2010 [[Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples]] (DRIP) and related treaties which major powers have signed.&lt;ref name="Rebuilding"&gt;Howe, Miles. [http://halifax.mediacoop.ca/story/rebuilding-wabanaki-confederacy/12494 "Rebuilding the Wabanaki Confederacy"], ''Halifax Media Co-op'' (September 3, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The confederacy has historically united five North American [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian language]]-speaking [[First Nations]] peoples. It played a key role in supporting the colonial rebels of the [[American Revolution]] via the [[Treaty of Watertown]], signed in 1776 by the [[Mi'kmaq]] and [[Passamaquoddy]], two of its constituent tribes. Under this treaty, Wabanaki soldiers from [[Canada]] are still permitted to join the [[United States|US]] [[United States Armed Forces|military]]. They have done so in 21st-century conflicts in which the US has engaged, including the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–14)|Afghanistan War]] and the [[Iraq War]].

Members of the Wabanaki Confederacy are:

* ''(Eastern) [[Abenaki]]'' or ''Penawapskewi'' ([[Penobscot]])
* ''(Western) [[Abenaki]]'' 
* ''Míkmaq'' ([[Mi'kmaq people|Mi'kmaq]], L'nu, or Micmac)
* ''Pestomuhkati'' ([[Passamaquoddy]])
* ''Wolastoqiyik'' ([[Maliseet]] or Malicite)

Nations in the Confederacy are also closely allied with the [[Innu]] and [[Algonquin people|Algonquin]] and with the [[Iroquoian]]-speaking [[Wyandot people|Wyandot]]. Wabanaki were also allies of the [[Wyandot people|Huron]] in the past. Together they jointly invited the colonization of [[Quebec City]] and [[LaHave, Nova Scotia|LaHave]] and the formation of [[New France]] in 1603, in order to put French guns, ships, and forts between themselves and the powerful [[Mohawk people]] to the west. Today the only remaining Huron [[First Nation]] resides mostly in the suburbs of [[Quebec City]], a legacy of this protective alliance.

The Wabanaki ancestral homeland stretches from Newfoundland, Canada to the [[Merrimack River]] valley in New Hampshire and Massachusetts, United States. This became a hotly contested borderland between the English of colonial New England and French Acadia following the European settlement in the early 17th century. Members of the Wabanaki Confederacy of Acadia participated in six major wars, beginning with [[King William's War]] in 1688, before the British defeated the French in North America:

*[[King William's War]] (1688–1697)
*[[Queen Anne's War]] (1702–1713)
*[[Dummer's War]] (1722–1725)
*[[King George's War]] (1744–1748)
*[[Father Le Loutre's War]] (1749–1755) 
*[[French and Indian War]] (1754–1763)

During this period, their population was radically decimated due to many decades of warfare, but also because of famines and devastating epidemics of [[infectious disease]].&lt;ref&gt;Prins, Harald E.L., and McBride, Bunny, [http://www.nps.gov/acad/historyculture/ethnography.htm "Asticou's Island Domain: Wabanaki Peoples at Mount Desert Island 1500–2000]," (National Park Service, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

Wabanaki people freely intermarried with French [[Catholics]] in Acadia starting in 1610 after the conversion of Chief [[Henri Membertou]]. After 1783 and the end of the American Revolutionary War, [[Black Canadians|Black Loyalists]], [[freedmen]] from the British colonies, were resettled by the British in this historical territory. They had promised slaves freedom if they left their rebel masters and joined the British. Three thousand freedmen were evacuated to Nova Scotia by British ships from the colonies after the war. 

Many intermarriages occurred between these peoples, especially in southwest Nova Scotia from [[Yarmouth, Nova Scotia|Yarmouth]] to [[Halifax (former city)|Halifax]]. Suppression of Acadian, Black, Mi'kmaq, and [[Irish Canadian|Irish]] people under British rule tended to force these peoples together as allies of necessity. Some white and black parents abandoned their [[mixed-race]] children on reserves to be raised in Wabanaki culture, even as late as the 1970s.{{cn|date=March 2018}}

The British declared the Wabanaki Confederacy forcibly disbanded in 1862. However the five Wabanaki nations still exist, continued to meet, and the Confederacy was formally re-established in 1993.

== Contemporary==
The Wabanaki Confederacy gathering was revived in 1993. The first reconstituted confederacy conference in contemporary time was developed and proposed by Claude Aubin and Beaver Paul and hosted by the Mi'kmaq community of [[Listuguj]] under the leadership of Chief Brenda Gideon Miller. The sacred Council Fire was lit again, and embers from the fire have been kept burning continually since then.&lt;ref name="ICT"/&gt; The revival of the Wabanaki Confederacy brought together the Passamaquoddy Nation, Penobscot Nation, Maliseet Nation, the Mi'kmaq Nation, and the Abenaki Nation

Following the 2010 UN DRIP declaration (Declaration of Rights of Indigenous Peoples),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://bangordailynews.com/2010/12/19/news/bangor/wabanaki-tribes-cheer-un-declaration-that-defends-their-rights/ |title=Wabanaki tribes cheer UN declaration that defends their rights |work=Bangor Daily News — BDN Maine |publisher=Bangordailynews.com |date=2010-12-19 |accessdate=2016-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; the tribes began to assert their rights as defined in it. They invited non-Indian people to participate in the Confederacy meetings, especially [[environmental activist]]s.&lt;ref name="Rebuilding"/&gt; The Wabanaki leadership emphasized the continuing role of the Confederacy in protecting [[natural capital]]. 

Some key quotes from leading participants:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"When we talk about Wabanaki people, we're also talking about Wabanaki people being the land, being the trees, being the animals, because in that cultural perspective, we're all related...The Wabanaki are in a far better position to defend the land," says gkisedtanamoogk. "No land was ever ceded, and that's acknowledged by both the province and the federal government. So on the basis of the treaties, what we're suggesting is that you and I have a common responsibility to the land under those treaties." – gkisedtanamoogk, the Gathering's fire keeper.&lt;ref name="Rebuilding"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Within the Wabanaki territory we're looking for allies that are going to stand against the total annihilation of our land and water and air. We're looking for allies who will help us to put our nation back together, and put it back in order. And we're asking our allies to help us empower that. And in the process of doing that, they will be decolonizing us and they will be decolonizing themselves." – Jeaba-weay-quay (roughly translated from Obijway to 'The woman whose voice pierces').&lt;ref name="Rebuilding"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"We're going to rebuild the Wabanaki Confederacy," says LaPorte. "We also invited some non-Natives...to come and be with us and to help us build an alliance, so that when we...come into conflict with the government and some of their decisions and policies...to have them stand beside us and to let their government know that it's not only Native people who are worried about the water, the land, the air. But it's also people from their nation that are concerned." – Harry LaPorte, grand chief of the [[Maliseet]] First Nation&lt;ref name="Rebuilding"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The final press release indicated that "the grandmothers" would decide the next step in reconstructing the confederacy as a legal and sovereign entity. The structure resembles that of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indigenous Peoples]] in [[Chiapas]].

[[Alma Brooks]] represented the Confederacy at the June 2014 [[UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Warden |first=Rachel |url=http://rabble.ca/blogs/bloggers/kairos-canada/2014/06/indigenous-women-unite-un-permanent-forum-on-indigenous-issues |title=Indigenous women unite at UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues |website=Rabble.ca |date=2014-06-06 |accessdate=2016-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; She discussed the Wabanaki/Wolostoq position on the [[Energy East]] pipeline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nbmediacoop.org/2013/10/14/energy-east-pipeline-poses-enormous-threat-to-environment-advocates-for-renewable-energy-hold-parallel-summit |title=“Energy East pipeline poses ‘enormous threat’ to environment:” Advocates for renewable energy hold parallel summit |publisher=NB Media Co-op |date=2013-10-14 |accessdate=2016-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Opposition to its construction has been a catalyst for organizing:
:"On May 30 [2015], residents of [[Saint John, New Brunswick|Saint John]] will join others in [[Atlantic Canada]], including Indigenous people from the Wolastoqiyik (Maliseet), Passamaquoddy and Mi'kmaq, to march to the end of the proposed pipeline and draw a line in the sand."

===2015 Grandmothers' Declaration===
These and other preparatory meetings set an agenda for the August 19–22, 2015, meeting&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abenakitribe.org/uploads/wabanakiconfederacy2015flyer.pdf|format=PDF|title=WABANAKI CONFEDERACY CONFERENCE|date=August 2015|website=Abenakitribe.org|accessdate=2016-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; which produced the promised Grandmothers' Declaration&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://willinolanspeaks.com/shares/peoples-lawsuit-related-media-coverage/peoples-lawsuit-plaintiffs-present-to-nb-fracking-commission/wabanaki-confederacy-conference-statement-2015/ |title=Wabanaki Confederacy Conference Statement 2015 |website=Willinolanspeaks.com |date= |accessdate=2016-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; "adopted unanimously at N'dakinna ([[Shelburne, Vermont|Shelburne, VT]]) on August 21, 2015". The Declaration included mention of:

*Revitalization and maintenance of indigenous languages
*Article 25 of the [[United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples]] on land, food and water
*A commitment to "establish decolonized maps"
*The [[Wingspread Statement]] on the [[Precautionary Principle]]s
*Obligation of governments to "obtain free, prior, and informed consent" before "further infringement"
*A commitment to "strive to unite the Indigenous Peoples; from coast to coast", e.g. against [[Tar Sands]].
*Protecting food, "seeds, waters and lands, from chemical and genetic contamination"
*Recognizes and confirms the unique decision-making structures of the Wabanaki Peoples in accordance with Article 18 of the UN DRIP indigenous decision-making institutions:
**"Our vision is to construct a Lodge, which will serve as a living constitution and decision-making structure for the Wabanaki Confederacy."
*Recognizes the Western Abenaki living in Vermont and the United States as a "People" and member nation
*Peace and friendship with "the Seven Nations of [[Iroquois]]"

=== Position on ecological and health issues ===
On October 15, 2015, Alma Brooks spoke to the New Brunswick Hydrofracturing Commission, applying the Declaration to current provincial industrial practices:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.willinolanspeaks.com/shares/?p=1124 |title=Alma Brooks: Statements to New Brunswick Hydrofracturing Commission Oct 2015 |website=Willinolanspeaks.com |date=2013-10-18 |accessdate=2016-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*She criticized the "industry of [[hydro-fracturing]] for natural gas in our territory" because "our people have not been adequately consulted... have been abused and punished for taking a stand," and cited traditional knowledge of floods, quakes and salt lakes in New Brunswick;
*Criticized [[J. D. Irving|Irving Forestry Companies]] for having "clear cut our forests [and] spraying poisonous carcinogenic herbicides such as [[glyphosate]] all over 'our land', to kill hardwood trees, and other green vegetation," harming human and animal health:
*Noted "Streams, brooks and creeks are drying up; causing the dwindling of [[Atlantic salmon]] and trout. Places where our people gather medicines, hunt deer and moose is being contaminated with poison. We were not warned about the use of these dangerous herbicides; but since then cancer rates have been on the rise in Maliseet Communities; especially [[breast cancer]]s in women and younger people are dying from cancer."
*[[Open pit mining]] "for [[tungsten]] and [[molybdenum]] [which] require [[tailing pond]]s; this one designated to be the largest in the world [which] definitely will seep out into the environment. A spill or leak from the [[Sisson Brook]] open pit mine will permanently contaminate the [[Nashwaak River]]; which is a tributary of the Wolastok ([[Saint John River (Bay of Fundy)|St. John River]]) and surrounding water ways. This is the only place left clean enough for the survival of the [[Atlantic salmon]]."
*"[[Oil pipeline]]s and "refineries ... bent on contaminating and destroying the very last inch of (Wəlastokok) Maliseet territory."
*Rivers, lakes, streams, and lands.. contaminated "to the point that we are unable to gather our annual supply of [[fiddlehead]]s [an edible fern], and medicines."
*The "duty to consult with aboriginal people...has become a meaningless process,"... "therefore governments and/or companies do not have our consent to proceed with hydro-fracturing, open pit mining, or the building of pipelines for gas and oil bitumen."

=== 2016 ===
The Passamaquoddy will host the 2016 Wabanaki Confederacy Conference.

==Biography==

Poon began writing novels and plays in her early teens&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://goodbooksguide.blogspot.com/2008/03/words-come-easy-to-wena-poon.html |title=Eric Forbes's book addict's guide to good books: Words come easy to Wena POON |publisher=Goodbooksguide.blogspot.com |date=17 March 2008 |accessdate=15 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=March 2014}}.

According to Poon her grandmother and the story of her family as well as her home country during [[World War II|WWII]] served as a major inspiration to her as a writer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.japantimes.co.jp/culture/2014/08/23/books/wena-poon-life-death-occupied-kyoto/|title=Wena Poon on life and death in occupied Kyoto {{!}} The Japan Times|work=The Japan Times|access-date=2018-01-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; She speaks English, French, [[Modern Standard Mandarin|Mandarin]], [[Teochew dialect|Teochew]], [[Cantonese]] and [[Hokkien]] {{clarify|date=September 2017}} and reads [[Japanese writing system|Japanese]] script.  These languages are sometimes used in her English-language fiction. She claimed that she had grown up with multilingual radio broadcasts and television series including [[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]. Poon herself described her childhood as "audio-visual". She is a photography enthusiast and has incorporated some of her photographs as illustration to her novella "Kami and Kaze".

In 2009, Poon released ''The Proper Care of Foxes''.  Using Voltaire's "Il fault cultiver notre jardin" as a theme, the stories take place in Singapore, Hanoi, Hong Kong, London, New York, and Palo Alto.  The title story is about a high-flying young London banker who was laid off during the recession and his chance encounter with an old classmate from Malaysia.  Published by Ethos Books, it earned her a second longlist nomination for the [[Frank O'Connor International Short Story Award]] and another nomination for the Singapore Literature Prize.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.asiaone.com/print/News/Latest%2BNews/Showbiz/Story/A1Story20100624-223724.html |title=Asiaone – S'pore firm offers |publisher=News.asiaone.com |date=24 June 2010 |accessdate=15 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Poon released ''Maxine, Aoki, Beto + Me'', her third short fiction collection featuring stories and her black and white photographs from around the world. Most of the stories have been previously published in international literary anthologies&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://asiancha.blogspot.com/2011/07/wena-poon-and-blair-reeve-in-asia.html |title=: Wena Poon and Blair Reeve in Asia Literary Review |publisher=Asiancha.blogspot.com |date=7 July 2011 |accessdate=15 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and journals in 2010–2012, including "The Architects", winner of the Willesden Herald Prize in London&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.willesdenherald.com/competition/previousyears.php |title=The Willesden Herald short story competition – Previous years |publisher=Willesden Herald |accessdate=15 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "Dialogue Between Novillera and Minotaur", shortlisted for the Prix Hemingway in France.

==Theater==
Poon's novel ''Alex y Robert'' was commissioned by a Singapore theatre director originally for the stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.palgrave.com/products/title.aspx?pid=478556 |title=Writing a First Novel &amp;#124; Karen Stevens &amp;#124; Palgrave Macmillan |publisher=Palgrave.com |date=27 January 2014 |accessdate=15 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was acquired by [[BBC Radio 4]] and made into a 10 episode radio drama starring veteran BBC American actress [[Lorelei King]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00tl4h6 |title=BBC Radio 4 – Book at Bedtime, Alex y Robert, Episode 1 |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=6 September 2010 |accessdate=15 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A short story spinoff from ''Alex y Robert'', ''Dialogue Between Novillera &amp; Minotaur'', was translated in French and performed in the ancient Roman amphitheater in [[Nimes]], France. It was shortlisted for France's Hemingway Prize and later published by Avocats du Diable in a French anthology called ''Pas De Deux'' (September 2011).

Poon's great-granduncle was the head of a Chinese [[Teochew people|Teochew]] opera troupe in [[Malaysia]] during the golden era of [[Chinese opera]] in the 1930s. Poon incorporated Teochew opera in her latest English play ''The Wood Orchid'', which was performed at [[Westminster Abbey]], London, as part of the [[Bush Theatre]]'s October 2011 project "[[Sixty Six Books]]". The authentic Chinese opera costumes in the play were sourced from Manchester. The play is for 4 actors, based upon a chapter of the [[King James Bible]].&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web

|accessdate=6 May 2012
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The title refers to [[Hua Mulan]], the Chinese woman warrior.  The play was published by [[Oberon Books]] London in a book called ''66 Books: 21st Century Writers speak to the King James Bible'' (October 2011).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oberonbooks.com/66-books |title=Sixty-Six Books &amp;#124; Bush Theatre a contemporary response to the King James Bible Bush Theatre |publisher=Oberon books |accessdate=15 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Novels==

In 2016, Poon released 4 new novels, among which are "Chang'an: A Story of China &amp; Japan" (長安）, about a Mandarin-speaking Japanese army doctor who hides in Communist China for decades as a Chinese man,  and "Shonanto no Ramen" （吃麵民族）, about the shared love of ramen noodles between the Chinese and the Japanese, set against the backdrop of war during the Japanese Occupation of Singapore. The novels explore the history of China and Japan's intimate but fractious relationship.

Poon is bilingual and writes in English. However, "Shonanto no Ramen" is her first book written in both English and Chinese.

In 2015, Poon published a novel, "Cafe Jause: A Story of Viennese Shanghai", about a Viennese cafe run by Hungarian and Viennese Jews in 1936 Shanghai. It was launched at the China Bookworm Literary Festival in Beijing, Chengdu and Suzhou. In 2014, Poon released a novel called "Kami and Kaze" (神と風). Set in 1948 Kyoto, the novel is about the [[American occupation of Japan]] and the relationship between an Allied administrator, Kate Schroeder, and her young Japanese driver, Nakamura Shinji. It examines white racism against the Japanese and the power of the words "[[kamikaze]]" in the Western imagination.

Poon's 2010 novel, ''Alex y Robert'', is a 21st-century novel about a young woman from [[Texas]] who goes to Spain to break into the male-dominated world of [[bullfighting]].&lt;ref&gt;

In 2012–2015, Poon wrote a trilogy of Chinese-Japanese sword fighting novels&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://prestige-singapore.com.sg/node/814/40%20Under%2040%202013 |title=Wena Poon |publisher=Prestige Singapore |accessdate=15 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a humorous, modern response to classical Ming plays, [[Kunqu|Kun opera]], [[wuxia]] television shows, and samurai films. They are published as "The Adventures of Snow Fox &amp; Sword Girl", "Voyage to the Dark Kirin", and "The Marquis of Disobedience". The trilogy is a rumination on the history of the Chinese diaspora and their idea of a mythic China. It also examines the warrior or bushido code and its meaning for modern society and for women.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/ttVlgB8Z4Rn0lZrhLSV2WT/deadlier-than-the-male-female-warriors-in-chinese-wuxia&lt;/ref&gt;
