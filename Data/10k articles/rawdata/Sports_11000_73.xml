1738 was the 42nd English [[cricket]] season since the earliest known [[First-class cricket#Important matches classification|important match]] was played. Details have survived of eight [[First-class cricket#Important matches classification|important matches]].

As in 1737, [[Kent county cricket teams|Kent]] seems to have been the strongest county, again defeating the combined [[London &amp; Surrey cricket team|London &amp; Surrey]] team. [[London Cricket Club]] is featured in most of the surviving match reports. [[Chislehurst Cricket Club]] and [[Horsmonden Cricket Club]] became prominent. The earliest reference to cricket in the county of [[Dorset]] has been found.

== Important matches ==
The following matches are classified as [[First-class cricket#Important matches classification|important]]:&lt;ref name="status" group="note"&gt;First-class cricket was officially defined in May 1894 by a meeting at [[Lord's]] of [[Marylebone Cricket Club]] (MCC) and the [[county cricket|county clubs]] which were then competing in the [[County Championship]]. The ruling was effective from the beginning of the 1895 season. Pre-1895 matches of the same standard have no official definition of status because the ruling is not retrospective and the [[First-class cricket#Important matches classification|important matches]] designation, as applied to a given match, is based on the views of one or more substantial historical sources. For further information, see [[First-class cricket]], [[Forms of cricket]] and [[History of cricket]].&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7383">[[Image:40s Topps Logo.jpg|thumb|right|Brand name printed on the merchandise in the 1940s]]
The 1940s was both the beginning and end of an era for [[trading cards]]. There was virtually nothing produced in the great divide caused by [[World War II]]. Up to 1941 manufacturers like [[Bowman Gum|Gum Inc.]] (later Bowman) and [[Goudey]], had raised the bar on the confection industry by leaving behind the tobacco age of marketing to adults and bringing forth the bubble gum age and marketing to children. [[Topps]] had been primarily a gum company but took up adding premiums to their products after the war. Their first sets featured various sizes and numerous topics, mostly non-sport. The most notable is the [[Bazooka (chewing gum)|Bazooka Gum]] comics although the earlier issues did not yet feature [[Bazooka Joe|Joe]] and his gang. Below are descriptions of Topps products that were issued in the 1940s.

==Multi-sport==
'''1948 Topps Magic Photos (R714-27)'''

This set contains 252 small individual cards featuring sport and non-sport subjects. They were issued in 19 lettered series with cards numbered within each series. The 'magic' of the cards were the fact that they came out of the pack blank until the image was revealed by moistening the surface and applying the developing agent which was supplied by the wrapper in a one cent pack or a piece of orange mystery paper supplied in the five cent packs. The subsets by group letter are:  A Boxing Champions, B All-American Basketball, C All-American Football, D Wrestling Champions, E Track &amp; Field Champions, F Stars of Stage &amp; Screen, G American Dogs, H General Sports, I ''None issued'', J Movie Stars, K Baseball Hall of Fame, L Aviation Pioneers, M Famous Landmarks, N American Inventors, O American Military Leaders, P American Explorers, Q Basketball Thrills, R Football Thrills, S Figures of the Wild West, T General Sports. Size: {{frac|7|8}} × {{frac|1|7|16}} in (2.2 × 3.7&amp;nbsp;cm) 

'''1949 Spalding Sports Show''' 

These are a set of rust colored cartoons that deal with numerous sports. The illustrator of the cartoons is [[Willard Mullin]]. They were found on the inside of the foil wrapper of Bazooka gum. Size: 2 × {{frac|2|3|4}}&amp;nbsp;inches

==Non-sport==
'''1947-49 Bazooka Comics''' As a way to boost sales Topps began putting small comic strips as inner wrappers for their gum. These comics were reprints of strips from [[DC Comics|DC]] and [[Fawcett Comics|Fawcett]]. Titles such as 'Doc Sorebones' and 'Peg' were found in varying sizes in Bazooka Gum from 1947 to 1948. In 1949 Topps began using a character called 'Bazooka, The Atom Bubble Boy' that represented something of a personage of the product. These comics that featured the Bubble Boy were done in a dull rust color making them hard to read. Despite their quality they would represent the precursor to the famous Bazooka Joe comics.

'''1948 Tattoo Bubble Gum''' (150) These items are transfers that feature various generic sport and non-sport drawings. Size: {{frac|1|3|8}} × {{frac|2|5|8}}&amp;nbsp;inches.

'''1948 It Happened to a President''' (20) These comics are printed on thin tissue which was the interior wrapper of 'Golden Coin Bubble Gum'. The stories are done in rust color and tell of a true event in the life of a president. Size: {{frac|4|5|8}} × {{frac|6|3|16}}&amp;nbsp;in.

'''1949 President Coins''' (34) The coins in this set are made of gold colored plastic. Each coin is numbered in sequence of each subject's presidency. Like most coins these items feature a bust of the president on the front with an eagle atop a shield on the back. The term of each president is depicted in relief around the portrait of each coin. Size: {{frac|1|1|8}}&amp;nbsp;in. diameter

'''1949 Famous Events''' (~60) This set was a series of comics that doubled as a gum wrapper. Alternately titled 'On This Day in History' the rust colored comics feature artwork of a special event on a particular day in history. Above the picture is a panel describing the event while a panel below the artwork offers astrological data for people born on the respective day. Size: 2 × {{frac|2|7|8}}&amp;nbsp;inches

'''1949 Flags of all Nations &amp; Soldiers of the World''' (~32) These cards are double features in that they have two fronts. The Soldiers appeared on the glossy cardboard side while the Flags were printed on shiny patterned cloth on the other side. Size:{{frac|7|8}} × {{frac|1|7|16}}&amp;nbsp;inches

'''1949 Flags of the World Parade''' (100) These Flags are a larger size as well as an expanded version of the above Flags &amp; Soldiers set. This issue has five subsets divided by continent. There are flags of countries as well as service branches, naval standards, and confederated republics. The cards have both a set number and a subset number. The backs have a brief explanation of the flag. To the left of the text and below the set number is a line drawing of the soldier. Size: {{frac|1|3|4}} × {{frac|2|7|8}}&amp;nbsp;inches

'''1949 Flip-O-Vision''' (50)  This is a set of flip books that make a mini movie. Out of the packs the books were 30 pages folded like an accordion. The pages had to be separated and then bound together with string or thread to be used as a flip movie. The subjects featured are various celebrities performing their craft. Size: {{frac|1|7|8}} × 4&amp;nbsp;inches

'''1949 License Plates''' (75) This set offered another double feature type card for the consumer. One side of the cards are license plates for every state as well as District of Columbia and Quebec while the other side posed a question about a car or landmark. The question side of the cards had a gray coating over 70 percent of it while the remainder had the question. The answer to the question was underneath the coating.  Size: {{frac|7|8}} × {{frac|1|7|16}}&amp;nbsp;inches

'''1949 Play Coins of the World''' (120) These play coins are plastic coated with either brass, copper, or nickel depending on their denomination. There are three different denominations for each country which are 25, 50 and 100. The coins were distributed with either gum or lollipops. Size: {{frac|7|8}}&amp;nbsp;inch diameter

'''1949 The Story of the Atom Bomb''' (18) The A-Bomb set was printed on the inside of the gum trays instead of the actual gum wrappers. The stories are printed on one half of the panel while the other half had a mail-in premium offer. Size:{{frac|7|8}} × {{frac|2|1|4}}&amp;nbsp;inches

'''1949 X-Ray Round Up''' (200) This issue was a series of well colored and nicely detailed small size cards. The set had four subsets of fifty cards each. The subsets are Figures of the Wild West, Indian Chiefs, Pirates of the Spanish Main, and Savage Tribesmen. The X-Ray concept deals with the images on the back of the cards which were drawn with wavy orange lines. Also visible on the picture are very fine blue-green lines. A red X-Ray slip that was included could be used over the picture where the blue-green lines would reveal a hidden picture with a caption. Size: {{frac|7|8}} × {{frac|1|7|16}}&amp;nbsp;inches

'''Alizanda bin Sitom''' (born 29 July 1970) is a retired [[Brunei]]an [[Association football|footballer]] who played as a [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=RHB Singapore Cup - Know your foreign teams |url=http://www.sleague.com/news-features/news/2016/january/amri-takes-on-big-brother-role-at-young-lions/-rhb-singapore-cup---know-your-foreign-teams|date=27 April 2007|publisher=S.League|accessdate=16 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having played for the [[Brunei (Malaysia Premier League team)|Brunei national representative team]] in Malaysia's [[M-League|M-League System]] at the turn of the century,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Penang Rout KL, Terengganu Beat Brunei|url=http://ww1.utusan.com.my/utusan/info.asp?y=2000&amp;dt=0726&amp;pub=Utusan_Express&amp;sec=Sports&amp;pg=so_04.htm|date=26 July 2000|publisher=Utusan Malaysia|accessdate=16 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; he is notable for returning to DPMM for a third spell at the age of 46.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=DPMM FC finalise squad for new S League season|url=http://borneobulletin.com.bn/dpmm-fc-finalise-squad-new-s-league-season/|date=16 February 2017|publisher=Borneo Bulletin|accessdate=16 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the year 2000, Alizanda was brought into the national representative team to replace [[Yunos Yusof]] who had retired after winning the [[Malaysia Cup]] the previous year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://homepage1.nifty.com/fumiki/games/mal_ml00.html|title=2000年　Ｍリーグ　DUNHILL PREMIRE [sic] 1|publisher=ASIAN FOOTBALL SHOW|date=|deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050830201638/http://homepage1.nifty.com/fumiki/games/mal_ml00.html|archivedate=30 August 2005|accessdate=16 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was rotated with [[Jefry Mohammad]] and [[Ibrahim Abu Bakar]] as Brunei suffered relegation, and in the following season competed with a young [[Wardun Yussof]] for the goalkeeper position as Brunei began life in [[Malaysia Premier League 2|Malaysia's Premier Two]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=M-League - Crunch time for Brunei|url=http://www.e-borneo.com/cgi-bin/np/viewnews.cgi?category=2&amp;id=996814585|date=3 August 2001|publisher=Borneo Bulletin|accessdate=16 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also made appearances for his future club [[Brunei DPMM FC|DPMM FC]] in the [[AFC Champions League]] against [[Geylang International|Geylang FC]] in [[2002–03 AFC Champions League qualification#Round 2 2|2002]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eteamz.com/dpmmfc/&lt;/ref&gt; When DPMM replaced Brunei in the [[Malaysia Premier League]] at the start of the [[2005–06 Malaysia Premier League|2005–06 season]], Alizanda transferred immediately to the royally-owned club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=UPBFC Perak And Kuala Lumpur Win Big |url=http://web6.bernama.com/bernama/v3/printable.php?id=170369|date=11 December 2005|publisher=Bernama|accessdate=16 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He gained promotion to the [[Malaysia Super League]] with DPMM but was largely second fiddle to Wardun. He was released in early 2009 following DPMM's signing of [[Azman Ilham Noor]] from [[NBT FC]].

In the 2016 close season, DPMM announced that Alizanda had signed a contract after the release of Azman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Ex-Hammer trainee set for DPMM FC move|url=http://borneobulletin.com.bn/ex-hammer-trainee-set-dpmm-fc-move/|date=22 October 2016|publisher=Borneo Bulletin|accessdate=16 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to his age, he was assumed to be holding a coaching role but his head coach [[Steve Kean]] has confirmed that Alizanda will compete for the goalkeeping position with Wardun, rekindling a rivalry last occurred eight years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Kean satisfied with tour of Bangkok|url=http://borneobulletin.com.bn/kean-satisfied-tour-bangkok/|date=8 February 2017|publisher=Borneo Bulletin|accessdate=16 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 2 April 2017, Alizanda started the match against [[Hougang United]] and kept a clean sheet in a 2–0 victory. It was his first competitive match in 8 years and made him the oldest player to play in the [[S.League]] aged 46 years, 8 months and 4 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Wasps Secure First Victory Of The Season Against Cheetahs|url=http://www.sleague.com/match-report/s-league/2017/April/2017-04-02/brunei-dpmm-fc|date=2 April 2017|publisher=S.League|accessdate=3 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made four league appearances in total, the last being a 9–3 drubbing by [[Home United FC|Home United]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Faris tears DPMM to shreds in Home United’s extraordinary 9-3 mauling|url=https://www.fourfourtwo.com/sg/news/faris-tears-dpmm-shreds-home-uniteds-extraordinary-9-3-mauling|date=25 May 2017|publisher=[[FourFourTwo]] Singapore|accessdate=29 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; His age was 46 years, 9 months and 26 days on that date.

The '''Biloxi Dragway''' was a [[National Hot Rod Association|NHRA]]/[[American Hot Rod Association|AHRA]]-sanctioned Quarter-Mile Drag Strip located in [[Biloxi]], Mississippi, United States and operated from August 18, 1957 to July 1, 1967.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Biloxi Dragway » Official Site » NHRA Hall Of Fame|url=http://biloxidragwayarchive.x10host.com/|website=biloxidragwayarchive.x10host.com|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Davis|first1=Larry|title=Super Stock: Drag Racing the Family Sedan|date=2010|publisher=CarTech Inc|isbn=9781934709481|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RYGA8YxPpxoC&amp;pg=PA208&amp;dq=biloxi+dragway&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=VkhlUorqHJKa8wTMioD4Dg&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=biloxi%20dragway&amp;f=false|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mississippi Drag Strip History|url=http://dragstriplist.com/mississippi|website=dragstriplist.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Clark Griffith Park''' or better known as '''Griffith Park''' was a [[stadium]] in [[Charlotte, North Carolina]], located at 400 Magnolia Avenue in the Dilworth section of town.  The park opened in 1941 and held as many as 5,000 people in a covered grandstand which extended from first base to third base.  It was primarily used for [[baseball]], and served as the home field for the [[Charlotte Hornets (baseball)|Charlotte Hornets]], the farm team for the [[History of the Washington Senators (1901–60)|Washington Senators]] from 1937 to 1961, and [[Minnesota Twins]] from 1961 to 1972, and the [[Charlotte Knights|Charlotte Orioles]], a AA Southern League farm team of the [[Baltimore Orioles]] from 1976 to 1987.  After a renovation of the park in 1976 for the O's, the park was renamed '''Jim Crockett Memorial Park''' in 1977 (but was mostly called '''Crockett Park'''), both in honor of [[Jim Crockett Sr.|the promoter who brought the team]], and to distance themselves from the former owners. The park was almost completely burned down on March 16, 1985. Investigators determined the fire was set by juveniles.

The Crockett family built a 3,000-seat makeshift stadium soon after the fire.  However, it was completely exposed to the elements.  The O's attendance fell off over the next 2 seasons, 1986, and 1987, because there was no protection for the fans. When the Charlotte O's last season was over [[George Shinn]] bought the team, and the stadium, and renamed it Knights Park.  The team was renamed Knights out of a naming contest to distance the similarity between the major league affiliate. The new Charlotte "Knights" only played there for their first season in 1988, and in 1989, the team switched affiliates to the Chicago White Sox, and moved to the new and much bigger ballpark in Fort Mill SC, the "Castle" or  [[Knights Stadium]].

'''Carter Gymnasium''' is a 947-seat multi-purpose [[arena]] in [[Buies Creek, North Carolina]]. It was previously home to the [[Campbell University]] [[Campbell Fighting Camels|Fighting Camels]] [[Campbell Fighting Camels men's basketball|men's basketball]] and women's basketball teams.  It was one of the smallest college basketball venues in [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]] (the [[G. B. Hodge Center]], home to the [[University of South Carolina Upstate]]'s program, is the current smallest Division I men's basketball arena). The building was named for textile executive Howard Carter.  Built in 1952 and opened in 1953, the dimensions of the basketball court are smaller than regulation, but a grandfather clause allowed Campbell University to continue its tenure in the division. The [[Campbell Fighting Camels|Fighting Camels]] began play in 2008 in the new [[John W. Pope, Jr. Convocation Center]]. The new $30 million arena seats 3,000 spectators for athletic events.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.campbell.edu/news/releases/fa06/fa06/ns_rel.0007.html Campbell breaks ground on the John W.

'''Centennial Bank Stadium''' (formerly known as '''Liberty Bank Stadium''') is located on the campus of [[Arkansas State University]] and is home to their [[college football]] team, the Red Wolves.  The stadium was named after the old nickname of the school, the Indians, until the 2007 season when it was renamed ASU Stadium. The venue was again renamed in September 2012 after Liberty Bank donated approximately $5 million to the university, and was renamed in 2013 after Liberty Bank was bought by [[Centennial Bank]]. The stadium currently has a [[Seating capacity|capacity]] of 30,406.

==History==
The stadium opened in 1974 however construction was not completely finished until prior to the 1975 season. Not all bleachers had been installed by the start of the 1974 season and lights were not installed until after the season. Despite not being fully completed, the Arkansas State football team began play there in 1974.  The original cost of the [[stadium]] was $2.5 million of which $1.4 million was raised by friends and [[alumni]] of the university. The first game played in the stadium was on September 28, 1974 against [[Louisiana Tech University]] and Arkansas State lost 21–7.  The first victory in the stadium was a 14–7 win over [[Eastern Michigan University]] on October 5, 1974.  A dedication game was played on November 2, 1974 against [[Northeast Louisiana University]] and Arkansas State won the game 17–14.

The stadium originally had a capacity of 16,343 when it first opened.  This was upgraded in 1980 to a capacity of 18,709.  Further expansion was completed in 1991, when Arkansas State moved up from [[Division I-AA|Division I-AA (FCS)]] to [[NCAA Division I-A|Division I-A (FBS)]] and new capacity requirements had to be met to keep up with this status, making the capacity 30,708.  The grandstand was double-decked with seats and Indian Stadium had a four level press area that includes the [[press box]] and two donor levels: Happy Hunting Grounds and Chiefs Council.  The area also includes a photo deck complete with an area for filming, Visiting Team AD Suite and coaches booths for both teams.  In 2001, a video/scoreboard was erected in the South end zone which cost more than a million dollars to purchase and construct.

In 2013, Liberty Bank was bought by Centennial Bank, and the naming rights were also absorbed. Liberty Bank Stadium was renamed Centennial Bank Stadium for the  [[2014 Arkansas State Red Wolves football team|2014]] football season.

===Renovations===
In 2002, more improvements were added to the stadium.  Luxury suites were added, increasing capacity to its current figure of 30,964. The players and coaches of the school moved into a brand new complex that included office space for coaches, dressing rooms, meeting rooms, and player lounges. When these areas are not being used by staff and players they are used for several different purposes.   These areas become suites used during football games, academic study areas for players and students, conference rooms, alumni functions, booster meetings, and recruitment purposes.  The complex now houses a place known as the Performance Enhancement Center. Inside this center there are several different areas that include the Athletic Training Center, Strength and Conditioning Center, Student-Athletic Academic Success Center, a computer lab, and other various offices and rooms.  In 2005, it was announced that Arkansas State University would replace the natural [[Cynodon|Bermuda grass]] field with [[FieldTurf]] at a cost of $500,000. However, Pro Green synthetic grass was installed in the stadium prior to the start of the 2006 season.

Thanks to a $5 million gift – the largest individual donation in A-State Athletics history – by alumnus Johnny Allison, a “Centennial Expansion” construction and renovation project to the stadium’s press box and west-side concourse took place during the nine-month period between the 2014 and 2015 seasons.

The entire project, including the press box and concourse, covered 40,000 square feet.  The Centennial Expansion project included a complete overhaul to the stadium press box, expanding it from 7,120 to 36,000 square feet. The project also included improvements and additions to the concourse bathrooms, concessions, gating and ticketing areas.

In 2013, Arkansas State University announced plans to build a $27 million Football Operations Center with an indoor practice field, weight rooms, lockers, medical centers, and staff offices. The plans originally called for the north end zone seating to be removed, but with average attendance being higher than ever, new seating with concession stands and television screens are to be added.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=ASU Announces $22 Million Football Facility Project|url=http://www.astateredwolves.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=7200&amp;ATCLID=205680819|publisher=Arkansas State University|date=September 6, 2012|accessdate=December 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, a [[Daktronics]] LED video display/scoreboard measuring approximately 32 feet high by 50 feet wide was erected in the south end zone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Daktronics to Install New Video Display and Sound System for Arkansas State University|url=http://www.daktronics.com/news/Pages/Daktronics-to-Install-New-Video-Display-and-Sound-System-for-Arkansas-State-University-.aspx|publisher=Daktronics|date=June 6, 2014|accessdate=August 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This replaces the scoreboard erected in 2001.

==Features==
Centennial Bank Stadium features a multi-level press box, which houses media areas, coaching booths, broadcasting locations, a video control booth, camera areas, suites, a club area and more. The face of the stadium has been redesigned to include 42 loge boxes, 20 suites, a club area covering close to 8,000 square feet and 344 club seats in its revenue-generating areas. Not only has depth been added to the press box, it now spans from approximately the 15-to-15 yard lines, allowing for enhanced media, coaching, broadcasting, control booth, visiting athletics director suite, and camera areas.

==Other uses==
The stadium was also used for a very brief period to showcase a game between the two largest high schools in the Jonesboro-area.  The game pitted [[Jonesboro High School (Arkansas)|Jonesboro High School]] against cross-town rival Nettleton High School.  The game was suspended temporarily after Jonesboro won the first two games in blowouts.  The average stadium attendance for these games were over 7,000.  The rivalry was renewed for the 2006 high school football season and the two schools again played the game in Indian Stadium.  Jonesboro won the 2006 game, but it was closer than the previous games; the final score was 44–38.  In 2010 a new rivalry started with the [[Greene County Tech High School|Greene County Tech Golden Eagles]].  This rivalry was known as the "Border Bowl" as the counties in which the schools are located (Craighead and Greene) border each other. The series was discontinued as Jonesboro swept the series 4–0.  In 2014, a new rivalry was formed with cross-town rival [[Valley View High School (Arkansas)|Valley View High School]].

==Attendance Records==
The largest crowd to see an Arkansas State football game in Centennial Bank Stadium was 31,243 on December 1, 2012, when the Red Wolves hosted Middle Tennessee State University. The highest average attendance in the stadium's history was during the [[2012 Arkansas State Red Wolves football team|2012]] season when Arkansas State drew an average of 26,398 spectators per game.

The '''Chester Cup''' is a [[Flat racing|flat]] [[Handicap (horse racing)|handicap]] [[Horse racing|horse race]] in Great Britain open to horses aged four years or older. It is run over a distance of 2&amp;nbsp;miles, 2&amp;nbsp;furlongs and 147&amp;nbsp;yards ({{convert|4100|yd|m|0|disp=out|abbr=off}}) at [[Chester Racecourse|Chester]] in May.

==History==
The event was established in 1824, and it was originally called the Tradesmen's Cup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Weatherby|first1=Edward|last2=Weatherby|first2=James|title=Racing Calendar for 1824|url=http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=nyp.33433066591193;seq=82;size=50;view=2up;page=root;orient=1;num=24|year=1825|publisher=C. H. Reynell|location=London|pages=25–26}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was initially a limited handicap with a minimum weight of {{nowrap|8 st 2 lb}}.

For a period the race was known as the Tradesmen's Plate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = 1873 Tradesmen's Plate | url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=bktEAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=ubEMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4230%2C437530 | newspaper = [[The Herald (Glasgow)|Glasgow Herald]] | date = 8 May 1873 | accessdate = 1 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time it was open to horses aged three or older.

The race was renamed the Chester Trades' Cup in 1874.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = 1874 Chester Trades' Cup | url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=O05EAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=trEMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4950%2C759600 | newspaper = Glasgow Herald | date = 13 May 1874 | accessdate = 1 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; From this point it was often referred to as the Chester Cup,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = The victory of Organist | url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=O05EAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=trEMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4890%2C756705 | newspaper = Glasgow Herald | date = 13 May 1874 | accessdate = 1 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that became its usual title in 1884.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = 1884 Chester Cup | url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=YJxEAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=orUMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5040%2C2873600 | newspaper = Glasgow Herald | date = 8 May 1884 | accessdate = 1 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chester Cup was formerly contested over 2&amp;nbsp;miles, 2&amp;nbsp;furlongs and 77&amp;nbsp;yards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = 1968 Chester Cup | url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=sG1AAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=pqMMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5246%2C1409525 | newspaper = Glasgow Herald | date = 8 May 1968 | accessdate = 1 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was abandoned in 1969,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Chester programmes abandoned | url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=SpZAAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=IqUMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5250%2C1217000 | newspaper = Glasgow Herald | date = 7 May 1969 | accessdate = 1 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and extended by 20&amp;nbsp;yards in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = 1970 Chester Cup | url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=hpVAAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=DqUMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6346%2C1030605 | newspaper = Glasgow Herald | date = 6 May 1970 | accessdate = 1 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The distance of the race was changed to 2&amp;nbsp;miles, 2&amp;nbsp;furlongs and 117&amp;nbsp;yards in 1992. It was increased to its present length in 1994.

'''Clenbuterol''', marketed as '''Dilaterol''', '''Spiropent''', '''Ventipulmin''',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/animalveterinary/products/approvedanimaldrugproducts/foiadrugsummaries/ucm054881.htm|title=FOIA Drug Summaries - NADA 140-973 VENTIPULMIN® SYRUP - original approval|last=Medicine|first=Center for Veterinary|website=www.fda.gov|language=en|access-date=2016-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[sympathomimetic]] [[amine]] used by sufferers of breathing disorders as a [[decongestant]] and [[bronchodilator]]. People with chronic breathing disorders such as [[asthma]] use this as a bronchodilator to make breathing easier. It is most commonly available as the [[hydrochloride]] [[salt (chemistry)|salt]], clenbuterol hydrochloride.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.inchem.org/documents/jecfa/jecmono/v38je02.htm|title=874. Clenbuterol (WHO Food Additives Series 38)|website=www.inchem.org|access-date=2016-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects and dosage==
Clenbuterol is a [[Beta2-adrenergic agonist|β&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; agonist]] with some structural and pharmacological similarities to [[epinephrine]] and [[salbutamol]], but its effects are more potent and longer-lasting as a stimulant and [[thermogenic]] drug.{{cn|date=August 2017}} It causes an increase in [[Aerobic exercise|aerobic]] capacity, [[central nervous system]] stimulation, [[blood pressure]], and [[oxygen]] transportation. It increases the rate at which body fat is metabolized while increasing the body's [[basal metabolic rate]] (BMR).{{cn|date=August 2017}} It is commonly used for [[smooth muscle]]-relaxant properties as a bronchodilator and [[tocolytic]].

It is classified by the World Athletic Doping Association as an anabolic agent, not as a β&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; agonist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Pluim |first1=BM |last2=de Hon |first2=O |last3=Staal |first3=JB |last4=Limpens |first4=J |last5=Kuipers |first5=H |last6=Overbeek |first6=SE |last7=Zwinderman |first7=AH |last8=Scholten |first8=RJ |title=β₂-Agonists and physical performance: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials. |journal=Sports medicine (Auckland, N.Z.) |date=1 January 2011 |volume=41 |issue=1 |pages=39-57 |doi=10.2165/11537540-000000000-00000 |pmid=21142283}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clenbuterol is also prescribed for treatment of respiratory diseases [[horse]]s, and not in dogs and cats; it is illegal in most countries to use in livestock used for food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Dowling |first1=Patricia M. |title=Systemic Therapy of Inflammatory Airway Disease |url=https://www.msdvetmanual.com/pharmacology/systemic-pharmacotherapeutics-of-the-respiratory-system/systemic-therapy-of-inflammatory-airway-disease |publisher=Merck Veterinary Manual |accessdate=14 November 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Human use==
Clenbuterol is approved for use in some countries, free or via prescription, as a bronchodilator for asthma patients.{{mcn|date=November 2018}}

===Legal status===
{{Expand section|date=December 2017}}
====United States====
Clenbuterol is not an ingredient of any therapeutic drug approved by the US [[Food and Drug Administration]]{{cn|date=November 2018}} and is now banned for [[IOC]]-tested athletes.&lt;ref name="independent"&gt;{{cite news |first=Katy |last=Guest |title=Clenbuterol: The new weight-loss wonder drug gripping Planet Zero |url=http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/health_medical/article2375069.ece |work=The Independent |date=2007-04-10 |accessdate=2007-04-10 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the US, administration of clenbuterol to any animal that could be used as food for human consumption is banned by the FDA.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.farad.org/eldu/prohibit.asp FDA's Prohibited Drug List], Food Animal Residue Avoidance &amp; Depletion Program&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/animaldrugsatfda/details.cfm?dn=140-973|title=Animal Drugs @ FDA|website=www.accessdata.fda.gov|access-date=2016-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Weight-loss drug===
Although often used by [[bodybuilder]]s during their "cutting" cycles,{{cn|date=June 2016}} the drug has been more recently known to the mainstream, particularly through publicized stories of use by celebrities such as [[Victoria Beckham]],&lt;ref name="independent"/&gt; [[Britney Spears]], and [[Lindsay Lohan]],
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Clenbuterol Weight Loss Hollywood Secret | url=http://www.prbuzz.com/health-a-fitness/63324-clenbuterol-weight-loss-hollywood-secret.html#.UYFkZUqU5qM | work=PRBuzz | date=2012-05-17 | accessdate=2012-04-10 | location= London}}&lt;/ref&gt; for its [[off-label use]] as a weight-loss drug similar to usage of other sympathomimetic amines such as [[ephedrine]], despite the lack of sufficient clinical testing either supporting or negating such use.

===Notable cases of use as performance-enhancing drug===
{{Example farm|date=June 2016}}
As a β&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; [[sympathomimetic]], clenbuterol has also been used as a [[performance-enhancing drug]].

A three-year suspension for taking clenbuterol kept sprinter [[Katrin Krabbe]] from competing in the [[1992 Summer Olympics]], and effectively ended her athletic career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.runnersweb.com/running/philip_hersh3.html|title=Philip Hersh - Series on Athletics in the GDR|author=|date=|website=www.runnersweb.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/athletics/1960281.stm | work=BBC News | title=Krabbe receives IAAF settlement | date=2002-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, [[San Francisco Giants]] pitcher Guillermo Mota, while a member of the New York Mets, received a 50-game suspension after testing positive for clenbuterol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/7902044|title=Giants reliever Mota gets 100-game suspension|author=|date=7 May 2012|website=ESPN.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2012, MLB officials announced they were again suspending Mota for 100 games due a positive test for clenbuterol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Dittmeier |first=Bobbie |url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20120507&amp;content_id=30646892&amp;vkey=news_mlb&amp;c_id=mlb |title=Mota suspended 100 games for positive test |publisher=Major League Baseball |work=[[MLB.com]] |date=May 7, 2012 |accessdate=May 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

American swimmer [[Jessica Hardy]] tested positive at the US trials in 2008. She was subject to a one-year suspension, having claimed she unknowingly took the drug in a contaminated food supplement.  Former [[New York Mets]] clubhouse employee [[Kirk Radomski]] admitted  in his plea deal to distributing clenbuterol to dozens of current and former Major League Baseball players and associates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/09/30/alberto-contador-tests-po_n_744711.html | title = Alberto Contador Tests Positive For Banned Substance  | date = 2010-09-30 | publisher = Huffington Post | first=Whitney | last=Snyder}}&lt;/ref&gt; After finishing fourth in the [[Canoeing at the 2008 Summer Olympics – Men's K-2 1000 metres|K-2 1000-m]] event at the [[2008 Summer Olympics]] in [[Beijing]], [[Poland|Polish]] [[canoe racing|sprint canoer]] [[Adam Seroczyński]] was disqualified for taking this drug, and Chinese cyclist [[Li Fuyu]] tested positive for it at the [[Dwars door Vlaanderen]] race in Belgium on March 24, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cyclingnews.com/news/radioshack-suspends-li-after-doping-positive|title=Radioshack suspends Li after doping positive - Cyclingnews.com|author=|date=|website=cyclingnews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In  2010, [[St. Louis Cardinals]] minor-league shortstop Lainer Bueno received a 50-game suspension for the 2011 season as a result of testing positive for clenbuterol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20100930&amp;content_id=15261378&amp;vkey=news_mlb&amp;c_id=mlb | work=MLB.com | title=Three Minor League players suspended | date=September 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cyclist [[Alberto Contador]] of Spain was banned for two years from professional cycling after testing positive for the drug at the 2010 Tour de France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

In April 2014, the [[Union Cycliste Internationale]] announced that it accepted Rogers' explanation that the substance had been ingested by him after consuming contaminated meat whilst competing at the [[2013 Tour of Beijing]], upholding Rogers' disqualification from the Japan Cup, but declining to impose any further sanctions on him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/apr/23/michael-rogers-uci-contaminated-meat |title=Michael Rogers cleared to race as UCI accepts contaminated meat claim |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=23 April 2014 |website=[[theguardian.com]] |accessdate=24 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, players of the [[Mexico national football team]] were found with clenbuterol in their [[bloodstream]]s, but were acquitted by WADA after they claimed the clenbuterol came from contaminated food. FIFA has also claimed 109 players from multiple countries
who were participating in the Under-17 World Cup in Mexico tested positive for this drug. However, FIFA and the World Anti-Doping Agency declined to prosecute any cases because the weight of evidence pointed to contamination from Mexican meat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://sports.yahoo.com/news/soccer-fifa-alarmed-food-supplements-084922095--sow.html | title=FIFA alarmed by use of food supplements | date=September 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/sports/soccer/news/_/id/7115036/clenbuterol-found-most-players-17-world-cup|title=Clenbuterol found in most players at Under-17 World Cup - ESPN&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|author=|date=|website=go.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] Forward Carter Ashton was suspended from the NHL for 20 games without pay for violating the NHL/NHL Players' Association Performance Enhancing Substances Program after it was determined that he had ingested clenbuterol. Carter claimed he used an unprescribed asthma inhaler.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.tsn.ca/leafs-ashton-suspended-20-games-for-violating-ped-policy-1.127003|title=Leafs' Ashton suspended 20 games for violating PED policy - TSN.ca|author=|date=6 November 2014|website=tsn.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, South Korean swimmer [[Kim Ji-heun]] has tested positive for clenbuterol at an out-of-competition test on May 13, 2014.

In 2016, the California State Athletic Commission decided to issue [[Francisco Vargas (Mexican boxer)|Francisco Vargas]]  a temporary boxing license on a probationary basis after he tested positive for clenbuterol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ringtv.craveonline.com/news/420539-francisco-vargas-issued-a-temporary-license-after-failed-drug-test|title=The Ring - The Bible of Boxing - News, Videos, Events and Ratings|author=|date=|website=The Ring}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, British Olympic sprinter [[Nigel Levine]] was provisionally suspended for failing a drug test.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/athletics/42972647|title=Nigel Levine: British sprinter provisionally suspended for failing drugs test|date=2018-02-07|work=BBC Sport|access-date=2018-02-07|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2018, champion boxer [[Canelo Alvarez]] tested positive for clenbuterol on two consecutive urine tests in February 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.tmz.com/2018/03/05/canelo-alverez-peds-gennady-golovkin-clenbuterol-boxing/|title=Canelo Alverez Tests Positive for Banned Substance, Blames Mexican Cows|work=TMZ|access-date=2018-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; This violation led to the cancellation of a heavily anticipated [[Canelo Álvarez vs. Gennady Golovkin#Rematch|rematch]] between Alvarez and [[Gennady Golovkin]], which was to be held on May 5, 2018. Alvarez blamed the positive tests on consumption of contaminated meats from Mexico. Notably, some Mexican beef farmers are known to add clenbuterol to cattle feed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/boxing-mma-wrestling/canelo-alvarez-gennady-golovkin-bout-canceled-following-doping-allegations/2018/04/03/a1ced0d2-375c-11e8-9c0a-85d477d9a226_story.html|title=Canelo Alvarez-Gennady Golovkin bout canceled following doping allegations|work=Washington Post|access-date=2018-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Side effects and dangers===
Clenbuterol can cause these side effects:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.steroidabuse.com/Profiles/clenbuterol-clen.html|title=Clenbuterol - SteroidAbuse .com|website=www.steroidabuse.com|access-date=2016-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Nervousness
* [[Thyrotoxicosis]]
* [[Tachycardia]]
* Subaortic [[stenosis]]
* [[High blood pressure]]

===Overdosage===
Use over the recommended dose of about 120 μg can cause muscle tremors, headache, dizziness, and gastric irritation. Persons self-administering the drug for weight loss or to improve athletic performance have experienced nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis, palpitations, tachycardia, and myocardial infarction.   Use of the drug may be confirmed by detecting its presence in semen or urine.&lt;ref&gt;R. Baselt, ''Disposition of Toxic Drugs and Chemicals in Man'', 8th edition, Biomedical Publications, Foster City, CA, 2008, pp. 325–326.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Food contamination===
Clenbuterol is occasionally referred to as "[[bute (disambiguation)#Drugs|bute]]" and this risks confusion with [[phenylbutazone]], also called "bute". Phenylbutazone, which is a drug also used with horses, was tested for in the [[2013 European meat adulteration scandal]].&lt;ref name=fsa&gt;{{cite web|title=Horse meat investigation. Advice for consumers|url=http://www.food.gov.uk/enforcement/monitoring/horse-meat/horse-meat-consumer-advice/|work=Enforcement and regulation|publisher=[[Food Standards Agency]]|accessdate=19 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Intended to result in leaner meat with a higher muscle-to-fat ratio, the use of clenbuterol has been banned in meat since 1991 in the US and since 1996 in the European Union. The drug is banned due to health concerns about symptoms noted in consumers. These include increased heart rate, muscular tremors, headaches, nausea, fever, and chills. In several cases in Europe, these adverse symptoms have been temporary.&lt;ref name="FSIS1995"&gt;[http://www.fsis.usda.gov/oa/background/clenbute.htm "Clenbuterol"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120829112146/http://www.fsis.usda.gov/oa/background/clenbute.htm |date=2012-08-29 }}, [[Food Safety and Inspection Service]] (FSIS), July 1995, Retrieved 8 April 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Clenbuterol is a growth-promoting drug in the [[Beta-adrenergic agonist|β agonist]] class of compounds. It is not licensed for use in China,&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/china/2011-09/30/c_131169759.htm China bans production, sale of clenbuterol to improve food safety] Retrieved 08/22/2012&lt;/ref&gt; the United States,&lt;ref name="FSIS1995" /&gt; or the EU&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/food/food/animalnutrition/contaminants/index_en.htm European Commission] Retrieved 08/22/2012&lt;/ref&gt; for food-producing animals, but some countries have approved it for animals not used for food, and a few countries have approved it for therapeutic uses in food-producing animals.

Not just athletes are affected by contamination. In Portugal, 50 people were reported as affected by clenbuterol in liver and pork between 1998 and 2002, while in 1990, veal liver was suspected of causing clenbuterol poisoning in 22 people in France and 135 people in Spain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.antidoping.hk/index.php/lang-en/precautions/advisory-notes/1530-the-clenbuterol-fear Anti Doping Advisory Notes] Retrieved 08/22/2012&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2006, some 330 people in [[Shanghai]] suffered from [[food poisoning]] after eating clenbuterol-contaminated [[pork]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite work|title=Research Brief: Food Safety in China|publisher=China Environmental Health Project, [[Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars]]|url=https://www.wilsoncenter.org/sites/default/files/food_safety%20_june28.pdf|date=June 28, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2009, at least 70 people in one [[Chinese province]] ([[Guangdong]]) suffered food poisoning after eating pig organs believed to contain clenbuterol residue.  The victims complained of stomachaches and diarrhea after eating pig organs bought in local markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/asiapcf/02/22/china.poisonings/index.html | work=CNN | title=China: 70 ill from tainted pig organs| date=2009-02-23 | accessdate=2010-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2009-02/23/content_7501017.htm | title = 70 ill after eating tainted pig organs | author = Wang Ying | publisher = China Daily | date = 2009-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2011, [[China's Ministry of Agriculture]] said the government would launch a one-year crackdown on illegal additives in pig feed, after a subsidiary of [[Shuanghui Group]], China's largest meat producer, was exposed for using clenbuterol-contaminated pork in its meat products. A total of 72 people in central Henan Province, where Shuanghui is based, were taken into police custody for allegedly producing, selling, or using clenbuterol.&lt;ref name=xinhuanet&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/china/2011-03/28/c_13802146.htm | work=Xinhua | title=China to launch one-year crackdown on contaminated pig feed  – xinhuanet.com | date=2011-03-28 | accessdate=2011-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The situation has dramatically improved in China since September 2011, when a ban of clenbuterol was announced by China's Ministry of Agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foodsafetynews.com/2011/04/amidst-scandal-china-expands-food-additive-blacklist/#.UDTUVKCdjRQ |work=[[Food Safety News]]|accessdate=August 22, 2012|title=Amid Scandal, China Bans More Food Additives|first=helena|last=Bottemiller|date=April 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Authorities around the world appear to be issuing stricter food safety requirements, such as the [[Food Safety Modernization Act]] in the United States, Canada's revision of their import regulations, China's new food laws published since 2009, South Africa's new food law, and many more global changes and restrictions.

==Veterinary use==
The US and the [[European Union|EU]] prohibit the use of clenbuterol in food-producing animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/cms_ia/importalert_210.html|title=Import Alert 68-03|website=www.accessdata.fda.gov|access-date=2016-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is, however, for the treatment of [[Recurrent airway obstruction|allergic respiratory disease]] in horses, as it is a [[bronchodilator]]. It can be used both orally and [[intravenously]]. It is also used in cattle to relax the uterus in cows, usually at the time of [[parturition]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.noahcompendium.co.uk/Boehringer_Ingelheim_Limited/Planipart_Solution_for_Injection_30_micrograms_ml/-37725.html Planipart Solution for Injection 30 micrograms/ml:  Uses] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721000033/http://www.noahcompendium.co.uk/Boehringer_Ingelheim_Limited/Planipart_Solution_for_Injection_30_micrograms_ml/-37725.html |date=2011-07-21 }}, National Office of Animal Health&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Japanese Language Proficiency Test]] is offered in three cities in Thailand; at first, it was just offered in Bangkok and Chiang Mai, but an additional test site was added in Songkhla in 2003.&lt;ref name="JLPT2003"/&gt; The Level 4 examination, aimed at beginning students with 150 contact hours of construction, is the most widely attempted; numbers of examinees decrease at higher levels. The number of examinees nearly quintupled between 1998 and 2006.&lt;ref name="JLPT1999"/&gt;&lt;ref name="JLPT2006"/&gt; Bangkok is the only city in [[Southeast Asia]] in which [[JETRO]]'s [[Business Japanese Proficiency Test]] is offered. In 2006, 232 candidates attempted the examination; their performance, measured by the proportion of examinees who were assessed as having each of the six possible levels of business Japanese proficiency, was similar to the average for examinees in all countries outside Japan. Thai students formed 13% of all candidates attempting the examination outside Japan.&lt;ref name="JETROStats"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jetro.go.jp/en/bjt/data/jlrt/pdf/res13report_en.pdf |format=[[PDF]] |title=13th JLRT (2006): A Summary Report |publisher=Japan External Trade Organization |date=2006 |accessdate=2008-01-12 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927192906/http://www.jetro.go.jp/en/bjt/data/jlrt/pdf/res13report_en.pdf |archivedate=2007-09-27 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Little Fauss and Big Halsy''''' is a 1970 American [[comedy-drama film]] directed by [[Sidney J. Furie]], starring [[Robert Redford]] and [[Michael J. Pollard]], also featuring [[Lauren Hutton]], [[Noah Beery, Jr.]] and [[Lucille Benson]].

A comedy-drama featuring the exploits of two [[motorcycle]] riders, this is one of Redford's lesser known works. [[Johnny Cash]] contributed the title song and soundtrack along with [[Carl Perkins]] and [[Bob Dylan]]. The title song, "The Ballad of Little Fauss and Big Halsy", written by Perkins, was nominated for a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song]].

The movie is the story of two motorcycle racers, the inept, unsuspecting Little Fauss (Pollard) and the opportunistic, womanizing Halsy Knox (Redford). Hutton played the role of Rita Nebraska, a role originally offered to [[Grace Slick]].

==Plot==

Halsy Knox, a professional motorcycle racer, runs into Little Fauss, an amateur racer, after a race held near Phoenix, Arizona. They strike up a friendship as Fauss is attracted to Halsy's carefree lifestyle. Fauss's father, however, regards Halsy as a bad influence on his son and refuses to help Halsy when his truck breaks down. When Halsy arrives later at the motorcycle repair shop where Fauss is employed he tricks the admiring Fauss into repairing his motorcycle for free. Halsy, who has been barred from racing for drinking on the track, When Fauss breaks his leg, Halsey proposes that they form a partnership in which Halsy would race under Fauss's name with Fauss serving as the mechanic. Fauss joins Halsy on the motorcycle racing circuit despite his parent's disapproval. Fauss is constantly confronted with his inferiority to Halsy, both on and off the racetrack. Their partnership is finally broken when Rita Nebraska, a drop-out from a wealthy background, arrives at the racetrack and immediately attaches herself to Halsy, despite the attention Fauss pays her. Fauss returns home to his parents to find his father has died. Several months later, Halsy visits him and attempts to ditch Rita, who is now pregnant. Fauss, however, refuses to take her. He informs Halsy that he plans to reenter the racing circuit. The two men race against each other a short time later at the Sears Point International Raceway. Halsy's motorcycle breaks down. As he leaves the track, he hears the announcement that Fauss has taken the lead.

In addition to the above Plot summary, at the Sears Point meeting Fauss tells Halsy that he has been drafted. The difference between these two characters is further defined.

[[Bangladesh Cricket Board]] (BCB) president, Nazmul Hassan, stated on 30 May 2013 that a Bangladesh player was questioned by the [[International Cricket Council|ICC]]'s Anti-Corruption and Security Unit (ACSU). He later confirmed the identity of the player as [[Mohammad Ashraful]],&lt;ref name=ibn&gt;{{cite web|title=BCB to investigate BPL fixing allegations|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/bangladesh/content/story/638574.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; the youngest centurion in test cricket.

== Initial allegation ==
The [[Bangladesh Premier League]] ([[Bangladesh Premier League|BPL]]) had its first brush with controversy in 2012, before the tournament had even begun. [[Mashrafe Mortaza]], one of Bangladesh's leading fast bowlers and captain of the [[Dhaka Gladiators]], reported to team management that [[Bangladesh Premier League|BPL]] matches could be [[Match fixing|fixed]] using a potential spot-fixing approach by a fellow cricketer. According to Gladiators media manager [[Minhaz Uddin Khan]], this information was relayed to the [[Bangladesh Premier League|BPL]]. Furthermore, an ICC ACSU officer was already in [[Dhaka]] to examine the situation.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.espncricinfo.com/bangladesh-premier-league-2012/content/current/story/552692.html Mashrafe reports spot-fixing approach] ESPNCricinfo. Retrieved 9 February 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, in [[Bangladesh Premier League|BPL]] 2013 additional allegations about match fixing emerged. The alleged match took place on 2 February, between the Dhaka Gladiators and the [[Chittagong Kings]] teams. The 28-year-old Ashraful was allegedly paid about one million taka (USD 12,800) to lose the match. However, according to local media, the check he received was returned for insufficient funds. He was also allegedly involved in fixing another match 10 days later against the [[Barisal Burners]]: his team lost by seven wickets.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.espncricinfo.com/bangladesh/content/story/639097.html Three international matches under cloud] ESPNCricinfo. Retrieved 5 June 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

== Investigation ==
[[Mohammad Ashraful]] was investigated several times by ACSU and confessed to the media that he had revealed everything to the ICC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=I have revealed all the details to ICC' says Mohammad Ashraful|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/sport/1843798/report-bpl-match-fixing-row-i-have-revealed-all-details-to-icc-said-mohammad-ashraful}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later apologised to the nation for his misbehaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=‘Forgive me,’ says Ashraful after confession|url=http://www.wisdenindia.com/cricket-news/forgive-me-ashraful-fixing-confession/64990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Action against fixing ==
Former Bangladesh spinner [[Shariful Haque]] was banned in September 2012 after an inquiry found him guilty of spot-fixing during the first edition of the [[Bangladesh Premier League|BPL]].

A Pakistani national was arrested in separate spot-fixing charges in 2012. In March 2013, the BCB handed down a 10-year ban to umpire [[Nadir Shah (umpire)|Nadir Shah]] after a sting operation by an Indian TV channel found him apparently willing to fix matches for cash.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fixing in Bangladesh Cricket|url=http://www.timesnow.tv/Ashraful-suspended-by-BCB-for-match-fixing/articleshow/4428988.cms}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) has decided "not to involve" former captain Mohammad Ashraful in any form of cricket until the ICC's ACSU submits its report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BCB 'not to involve' Ashraful in any form of cricket|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/bangladesh/content/story/638948.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mathare Youth Football Club''' was a [[association football|football]] club based in [[Nairobi]], [[Kenya]].&lt;ref name="RSSSF"&gt;[http://www.rsssf.com/tablesk/kenya07.html RSSSF]&lt;/ref&gt; They played in the [[Kenyan Premier League]],&lt;ref name="RSSSF" /&gt; but were relegated in 2008. They last competed in the [[FKF Division One]].

The team was owned by the [[Mathare Youth Sports Association]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kpl.co.ke/content.asp?id=15242 KPL website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081218181603/http://www.kpl.co.ke/content.asp?id=15242 |date=2008-12-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The team was a feeder team for [[Mathare United F.C.|Mathare United]], until Mathare Youth were promoted to the Premier League to rival them.

On 31 August 2012, the team disbanded and therefore pulled out of the [[2012 FKF Division One]], after which the [[Football Kenya Federation]] decided to nullify all of their second round results.&lt;ref name="Mathare Youth disband"&gt;{{cite web|title=FKF makes decision after Mathare Youth pullout|url=http://www.futaa.com/football/article/fkf-makes-decision-after-mathare-youth-pullout|author=Patrick Korir|publisher=Futaa.com|date=21 September 2012 |accessdate=23 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This meant that all teams that had played against them had their points revoked or given back, depending on the results of the matches,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Celtic disappointed by FKF's decision |url=http://www.futaa.com/football/article/celtic-disappointed-by-fkfs-decision |author=Brian Moseti |publisher=Futaa.com |date=22 September 2012 |accessdate=23 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and all upcoming fixtures involving them were cancelled.

'''Morris Park Racecourse''' was an American [[Thoroughbred horse race|thoroughbred horse racing]] facility from 1889 until 1904. It was located in a part of [[Westchester County, New York]] that was annexed into [[the Bronx]] in 1895 and later became known as [[Morris Park, Bronx|Morris Park]]. The racecourse was the site of the [[Belmont Stakes]] from 1890 through 1904 as well as the [[Preakness Stakes]] in 1890.

==History==
Morris Park Racecourse was conceived and built by majority shareholder [[John Albert Morris]] as a result of the planned closure of the nearby [[Jerome Park Racetrack]], where racing ended in 1894 to make way for the [[Jerome Park Reservoir]]. Principal owner John Morris had extensive business interests in [[Louisiana]] and the prominent New York businessman and horseracing enthusiast [[Leonard W. Jerome]] served as the racecourse's president. [[African-American]] [[National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame|Racing Hall of Fame]] jockey [[Isaac Burns Murphy|Isaac Murphy]] rode on opening day at the new facility—August 20, 1889—and Morris Park was described as "the finest race track in the world."&lt;ref&gt;[[#DiBrino|DiBrino 1977]], p.5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Geraldine's New Record; Made Yesterday at the New Race Track.

The track held the [[USA Cross Country Championships]] from 1890 to 1892 and 1897 to 1898.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.therealxc.com|title=The Accurate Database of U.S. National Champions|publisher=therealxc.com|accessdate=2018-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 10, 1890, Morris Park Racecourse hosted both the Preakness and Belmont Stakes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Burlington a Racehorse; He Wins the Twenty-Third Belmont in Good Style |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1890/06/11/archives/burlington-a-racehorse-he-wins-the-twentythird-belmont-in-good.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=June 11, 1890 |accessdate=2009-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the Preakness Stakes was canceled for three years then restarted in 1894 at [[Gravesend Race Track]] on [[Coney Island]], the Belmont Stakes was held at Morris Park until it moved to [[Belmont Park]] on [[Long Island]] in 1905. During this same period of 1890 through 1904, the [[Champagne Stakes (United States)|Champagne Stakes]] and the [[Ladies Handicap]] were also raced here. The [[Metropolitan Handicap]] was inaugurated here in 1891 as was the [[Matron Stakes (United States)|Matron Stakes]] the following year.

A few days before he died in May 1895, John Morris leased the racecourse, with an option to purchase, to the Westchester Racing Association. Although the 1½ mile racecourse was modified to a one-mile circuit to allow for better spectator viewing, a lack of patronage by [[upper class|high society]] members meant the clubhouse was usually empty. By 1902, the decline in attendance resulted in the decision to close Morris Park Racecourse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=New Race Track Planned; Morris Park to be Abandoned for a Course on Long Island |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=November 26, 1902 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1902/11/26/archives/new-race-track-planned-morris-park-to-be-abandoned-for-a-course-on.html |accessdate=2009-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The final day of races was held on October 15, 1904, and racing shifted to the new Belmont Park the following year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Record Was Broken at Morris Park's Last Day; Artful Set a New World's Mark for Six Furlongs Down the Hill |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=October 16, 1904 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1904/10/16/archives/record-was-broken-at-morris-parks-last-day-artful-set-a-new-worlds.html |accessdate=2009-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After its closure, the Morris Park Racecourse was used for [[automobile racing]] but a few years later the Morris heirs sold the property to real estate developers. The new owners ran into financial problems which resulted in the track being taken over by the City of New York in 1907. The city then leased it for two years to the Aeronautic Society of New York who hosted the first public [[air show]] on the grounds. In June 1909, [[Glenn H. Curtiss]] put on a flying exhibition at Morris Park.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Curtiss Flies Here; In the Air a Minute at Morris Park Race Course |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=June 17, 1909 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1909/06/17/archives/curtiss-flies-here-in-the-air-a-minute-at-morris-park-race-course.html |accessdate=2009-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 10, 1910 a fire ravaged much of the stables and nearby facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Flames Sweep Old Morris Park Track; Westchester Village Endangered by Fire Which Destroys Famous Stables |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=April 11, 1910 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1910/04/11/archives/flames-sweep-old-morris-park-track-westchester-village-endangered.html |accessdate=2009-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three years later the property was auctioned off to developers who would subdivide the land into building lots. As late as 1921 the clubhouse was still intact when it was sold as part of a 14-lot package to a company who converted it for use as a factory to manufacture [[ornamental iron]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Bronx Market; Part of Old Morris Park Race Track for Iron Factory |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=July 21, 1921 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1921/07/21/archives/the-bronx-market-part-of-old-morris-park-race-track-for-iron.html |accessdate=2009-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physical attributes==
Morris Park Racecourse was situated in the area bounded on the south by Sackett Avenue and by what is today the [[Amtrak]] [[Northeast Corridor]] railroad right-of-way, on the east by Williamsbridge Road, on the west by what is now Bronxdale Road, and on the north by [[Pelham Parkway (road)|Pelham Parkway]]. The grandstand stood at the intersection of Bogart and Fowler Avenues and the clubhouse was near the intersection of Fowler and Van Nest Avenues.&lt;ref&gt;[[#DiBrino|DiBrino 1977]], p.3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite map |publisher=[[United States Geological Survey]] |title=New York-New Jersey Harlem Quadrangle |url=http://docs.unh.edu/nhtopos/Harlem.htm|year=1900|scale=1:62,500 |series=15&amp;nbsp;Minute Series (Topographic) |section=SE |accessdate=2009-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The racetrack covered {{convert|360|acre|km²}} and had a grandstand {{convert|650|ft|m}} long that could accommodate up to 15,000 attendees. The main track had circumference of {{convert|1+1/2|mi|km|abbr=on}}, with a stretch that was {{convert|2250|ft|m}} long and widened from {{convert|80|ft|m}} at the top of the homestretch to {{convert|240|ft|m}} at the finish line. The north end of the track was located on a hill so horses had to run uphill on the backstretch and downhill on the homestretch. A [[Chute (racecourse)|chute]] on the main track permitted races of {{convert|1+1/8|mi|km|abbr=on}} to be run with one turn. Another track called the Eclipse course ran diagonally across the main track on a straightaway of {{convert|3/4|mi|km|abbr=on}}, joining the main track at its finish line. It was named after Eclipse, a horse owned by Francis Morris. A six furlongs race on the Eclipse course was nicknamed the "Toboggan Slide" and continues to be run today at [[Aqueduct Racetrack]] as the [[Toboggan Handicap]]. The stables at Morris Park Racecourse held a total of 1,000 stalls, more than any two of the other American racetracks combined.&lt;ref name="nyt1889-05-12"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#DiBrino|DiBrino 1977]], p.4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Worman |editor-first=James H. |title=Outing |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q6vQAAAAMAAJ |accessdate=2009-08-23 |volume=20 |year=1892 |publisher=The Outing Company, Ltd. |location=New York |pages=131–132}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Moscow Raceway''' is an [[Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile|FIA]]-approved [[Motorsport#Motor racing|motor racing]] venue, which is situated in the [[Volokolamsk|Volokolamsky District]] of [[Moscow Oblast]], near the villages of Sheludkovo and Fedyukovo, {{convert|97|km}} from [[Moscow]], [[Russia]]. It opened on 13 July 2012 for its first event as the fifth round of the [[World Series by Renault]] becoming the first major international motor-sport [[race track]] event in [[Russia]].

==History==
In September 2008, it was revealed that work was to begin on a Formula One circuit to be located at the village of Fedyukovo, Volokolamsky District. Official presentation of the project and laying of the first stone was held at the site on 1 October 2008, attended by architect [[Hermann Tilke]] and [[Formula One]] driver [[David Coulthard]]. Hans Geist, who at that time was the managing director of the project, stated that the track could pass an FIA inspection by June 2010, and that even without Formula 1 the project would be profitable staging either [[Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters|DTM]] or [[Grand Prix motorcycle racing|MotoGP]]. The cost of the project overall was 4.5 billion [[Russian ruble|rub]] when it opened on 13 July 2012.

===Design===
Moscow Raceway was designed to be categorized FIA 1T and FIM A, which would allow motorsport competition at any level, from national championships in auto and motorcycle racing, to Formula 1 and MotoGP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.gpupdate.net/en/f1-news/199780/moscow-to-start-construction-work-this-week/ |title=Moscow to start construction work this week |publisher=GPUpdate |date=30 September 2008 |accessdate=31 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The total designed track length is {{convert|4070|m|mi}}, with widths of between {{convert|12|m}} and {{convert|21|m}}. The start/finish line has a width of {{convert|15|m}} at an elevation of {{convert|22|m}}. The longest straight of {{convert|873|m}} is designed to allow Formula 1 cars to reach a speed of {{convert|311|km/h}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://moscowraceway.ru/ Moscow Raceway]&lt;/ref&gt; The circuit was finally classified as a FIM B grade course following inspections on 18 July 2012, one grade down from what was expected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FIM Inspection: Moscow Raceway gets homologation for Eni FIM Superbike World Championship|url=http://www.moscowraceway.com/eng/index.php?pid=2&amp;record_id=66|work=www.moscowraceway.com|accessdate=2012-08-07|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130129235951/http://www.moscowraceway.com/eng/index.php?pid=2&amp;record_id=66#|archive-date=2013-01-29|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Construction===
Built under a Russian–[[Germany|German]] joint venture named "Autobahn", the general contractor for construction of buildings and race track to international level was Stroytech-5, a member of a group of companies Stroytech.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}} Sub-contract partners included [[Siemens]]{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}, while [[Sergei Krylov (racing driver)|Sergei Krylov]] was working as an adviser.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rbth.ru/articles/2008/11/27/271108_formula.html |title=Fast tracking Formula One |date=2008-11-27 |accessdate=2018-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After initially signing a deal with [[Bernie Ecclestone]] in 2008, the project was dropped from the 2010 Formula 1 calendar in early 2009, and construction stopped. Construction resumed in June 2010, with the new contractor agreeing to complete the road section of the track by the end of 2011. By September 2011, all asphalt laying had been completed, and construction of the associated pit, support and medical buildings was being undertaken.

==Race history==
[[File:Eurocup Formula Renault 2.0 Moscow Raceway 2012.JPG|thumb|right|[[Eurocup Formula Renault 2.0]] race at Moscow Raceway in 2012.]]
The first events held at the circuit were part of the [[World Series by Renault]] on 13–15 July 2012, where it also became the second international motor-sport event in Russian history after the FIA European Truck Racing Championship event took place in the Smolenskring in July 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World Series by Renault a big hit in Russia|url=http://www.worldseriesbyrenault.fr/en/tv_news/news/Pages/WorldSeriesbyRenaultabighitinRussia.aspx|work=worldseriesbyrenault.fr|publisher=Renault Group|accessdate=2012-07-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120821093041/http://www.worldseriesbyrenault.fr/en/tv_news/news/Pages/WorldSeriesbyRenaultabighitinRussia.aspx#|archive-date=2012-08-21|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first race itself was the 5th round of the [[2012 Formula Renault 3.5 Series season|Formula Renault 3.5 series]], which was won by Dutchman [[Robin Frijns]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Flying Frijns first to win in Russia|url=http://www.worldseriesbyrenault.fr/en/tv_news/news/Pages/FlyingFrijnsfirsttowininRussia.aspx|work=worldseriesbyrenault.fr|publisher=Renault Group|accessdate=2012-07-14}}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first Russian to win a race there soon followed with [[Daniil Kvyat]] winning both races of the [[Eurocup Formula Renault 2.0|Eurocup Formula Renault 2.0 series]] round in a row.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Home win for Russia’s Kvyat|url=http://www.worldseriesbyrenault.fr/en/tv_news/news/Pages/HomewinforRussiasKvyat.aspx|work=worldseriesbyrenault.fr|publisher=Renault Group|accessdate=2012-07-14|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120826221918/http://www.worldseriesbyrenault.fr/en/tv_news/news/Pages/HomewinforRussiasKvyat.aspx|archivedate=2012-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kvyat does it again|url=http://www.worldseriesbyrenault.fr/en/tv_news/news/Pages/Kvyatdoesitagain.aspx|work=worldseriesbyrenault.fr|publisher=Renault Group|accessdate=2012-07-15|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120815070846/http://www.worldseriesbyrenault.fr/en/tv_news/news/Pages/Kvyatdoesitagain.aspx|archivedate=2012-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; A total of 10 Russian drivers were at the event including former 3.5 series Champion [[Mikhail Aleshin]]; many taking over other drivers for just this event.

On 21 July 2013, during the [[2013 Superbike World Championship season|World Superbike]] weekend, Italian rider [[Andrea Antonelli]] was killed in the [[2013 Supersport World Championship season|World Supersport]] race after being hit on the back straight by fellow rider [[Lorenzo Zanetti]]. Antonelli was airlifted to hospital where he died of massive head trauma, and the rest of the weekend's action was cancelled due to the torrential downpour that unquestionably contributed to the fatal crash.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13959">The '''National Operating Committee on Standards for Athletic Equipment''' (NOCSAE) is a [[non-profit organization]] operating in the [[United States]], whose mission is to reduce athletic injuries and death through standards and certification for [[athletic equipment]].  Schools and universities look to NOCSAE certification of equipment, particularly [[football helmet|helmets]], to protect players and reduce liability. NOCSAE data indicate a significant reduction in athlete fatalities and brain injuries when using NOCSAE-certified equipment.  NOCSAE has been criticized for stifling innovation, holding a conflict of interest, and not furthering true player safety.

==Creation and early years==
NOCSAE was organized in 1969 with the purpose of reducing death and injuries through the establishment of standards and certification for athletic equipment.&lt;ref name=Wong /&gt;&lt;ref name=Magee /&gt; It does this through researching and testing equipment, developing new standards, and improving existing ones.&lt;ref name=Wong /&gt; 

NOCSAE's commissioning came in the wake of the death of 32 players in [[professional football (gridiron)|organized football]] in 1968 and subsequent concerns over safety of athletic equipment.&lt;ref name=Magee /&gt; Based on its limited funding, NOCSAE has narrowed its efforts from protective athletic equipment in all sports toward helmets' effectiveness in reducing injury, particularly in football, [[lacrosse]], and [[baseball]].&lt;ref name=Magee /&gt;&lt;ref name=Lipsey /&gt;

==NOCSAE standards, adoption, and effects==
As a general matter, to be approved by NOCSAE, helmets must resist brain-injuring, concussive forces.&lt;ref name=Magee /&gt; Research from NOCSAE, in addition to targeting helmet safety standards, has also increased understanding of the mechanisms of head and neck injuries and the design and structure of helmets, headgear, and [[face mask (gridiron football)|face mask]]s.&lt;ref name=Lipsey /&gt;

NOCSAE standards are adopted, if at all, on a voluntary basis.  While a sport governing body may mandate that a piece of equipment be "NOCSAE approved", that is a rule or mandate of the governing body, not NOCSAE.&lt;ref name=Hillman /&gt;

By 1973, NOCSAE had finalized and published a standard testing criteria for football helmets.&lt;ref name=Magee /&gt;  The [[NCAA]] began advising its members to purchase helmets certified by NOCSAE beginning in 1975.&lt;ref name=Nelson /&gt; NOCSAE helmet standards were required in colleges in 1978 and in high schools in 1980.&lt;ref name=Hillman /&gt;

Stickers indicating NOCSAE certification are placed onto helmets.&lt;ref name=Amato /&gt;  Attorneys specializing in sports law advise schools and universities to purchase appropriate athletic equipment for the athletic activities offered that is of satisfactory quality, specifically football helmets that adhere to NOCSAE guidelines.&lt;ref name=Wong /&gt;  School athletic staff are advised by experts to search for NOCSAE certification stickers, both as part of their athletic training education and day-to-day activities .&lt;ref name=Wong /&gt;&lt;ref name=Amato /&gt;  They are warned to do this, in particular, for liability reasons, as "serious legal reprecussions may occur if a helmet is issued to a student athletic " lacking an approval sticker.&lt;ref name=Eaves /&gt;

NOCSAE reports that by 1985, the number of head injury fatalities had fallen significantly, with zero deaths in 1990, the first season with no deaths since reporting began in 1931.&lt;ref name=Wong /&gt; It also claims that the incidence of serious head injuries had fallen from 4.25 players per 100,000 in the late 1960s to 0.68 players per 100,000 in the late 1980s.&lt;ref name=Wong /&gt;

==Board membership==
The voting members of the NOCSAE board consists of representatives selected by their professional organizations, including:

* [[American Academy of Pediatrics]]
* [[American College of Sports Medicine]]
* [[American Medical Society for Sports Medicine]]
* [[Athletic Equipment Managers Association]]
* [[National Athletic Equipment Reconditioners Association]]
* [[National Athletic Trainers' Association]]
* [[Sporting and Fitness Industry Association]]
* [[American Football Coaches Association]]
* [[American Orthopedic Society for Sports Medicine]]
and a non-voting representative from each the National Collegiate Athletic Association and
the National Federation of State High School Associations.

==Criticisms==
Critics note that NOCSAE has "a close working relationship with" the sporting goods industry,&lt;ref name=Lipsey /&gt; and that because NOCSAE is funded by those few companies, it has "an inherent conflict of interest".&lt;ref name=Culverhouse /&gt; They also claim that NOCSAE is not effective at lessening concussions and improving safety.&lt;ref name=Culverhouse /&gt;  U.S. Senator [[Tom Udall]] of New Mexico requested that a federal agency, the [[Consumer Products Safety Commission]], assume an official role in helmet safety testing and certification, effectively displacing NOCSAE.&lt;ref name=Culverhouse /&gt;  

NOCSAE's certification standards have been criticized for authorizing helmet models that are "archaic or did not score well on specific impact tests."&lt;ref name=Borden /&gt;  In addition, NOCSAE's tests focus on preventing [[Catastrophic injury|catastrophic injuries]] like skull fractures, not concussions.&lt;ref name=Borden /&gt;  Observers note that such testing is equivalent to judging a car's safety based on its seat belts, with no consideration given to air bags.&lt;ref name=Borden /&gt;

The sole reliance of the [[NFL]] on NOCSAE certification, without considering the tested safety results and other data on helmet models, has been criticized by the players' union.&lt;ref name=Borden /&gt;

Critics note that while NOCSAE standards call for equipment to be reconditioned, where possible, and recertified every year,&lt;ref name=Magee /&gt; a school may keep its helmets as NOCSAE-certified simply by never submitting them for re-certification.&lt;ref name=Nowinski /&gt;

The inflexible nature of NOCSAE guidelines, stemming from the hesitance of helmet manufacturers to take any risks that could lead to lawsuits,&lt;ref name=Lipsey /&gt; leads some to argue that innovative helmet designs may be underdeveloped.&lt;ref name=Nowinski /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7253">The '''New York State Athletic Commission''' or '''NYSAC''', also known as the '''New York Athletic Commission''', is a division of the [[New York State Department of State]] which regulates all contests and exhibitions of [[unarmed combat]] within the state of [[New York (state)|New York]], including licensure and supervision of promoters, [[boxing|boxers]], [[professional wrestling|professional wrestlers]], seconds, ring officials, managers, and matchmakers. In 2016, the NYSAC was authorized to oversee all [[mixed martial arts]] contests in New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://espn.go.com/mma/story/_/id/15046063/new-york-state-assembly-passes-bill-lifts-ban-mma|title=New York State Assembly passes bill that lifts ban on MMA|last1=Okamoto|first1=Brett|date=22 March 2016|website=espn.go.com|publisher=ESPN|access-date=11 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The commission is based in [[New York City]].

==NBA rivalry==
The NYSAC was founded in 1920, when the [[Walker Law]] legalized prizefighting.&lt;ref name="guin1"&gt;
{{cite book |last=Morrison |first=Ian |title=The Guinness World Championship Boxing book |publisher=Guinness Publishing |date=1990 |pages=14–15 |isbn=0-85112-900-5}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  The National Boxing Association (NBA) was established in 1921 by other U.S. states to counter the influence of the NYSAC.&lt;ref name="guin1"/&gt;  Sometimes the NYSAC and the NBA recognized different boxers as World Champion,&lt;ref name="guin1"/&gt; especially in 1927–40.&lt;ref&gt;Morrison, pp.126–137&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1962, the NBA renamed itself the [[World Boxing Association]], and in 1963 the NYSAC supported the formation of the [[World Boxing Council]].&lt;ref name="guin1"/&gt;

*Should a contestant who is "down" arise before count of ten is reached and again go down intentionally, without being struck, the referee and timekeeper shall resume count where it left off.
*Should a contestant leave the ring during the one-minute rest period between rounds and fail to be in ring when gong rings to resume boxing, the referee shall count him out, the same as if he were "down."
*If a contestant is down, his opponent shall retire to the farthest corner and remain there until the count is completed. Should he fail to do so, the referee and timekeeper may cease counting until he has so retired.
*Referee shall decide all questions arising during a contest which are not specifically covered by these rules.

===Judges===
*The two judges shall be stationed at opposite sides of the ring. The decisions of the judges shall be based primarily on effectiveness, taking into account the following points:
**1. A clean, forceful hit, landed on any vulnerable part of the body above the belt should be credited in proportion to its damaging effect.
**2. Aggressiveness is next in importance and points should be awarded to the contestant who sustains the action of a round by the greatest number of skillful attacks.
**3. Defensive work is relatively important and points should be given for cleverly avoiding or blocking a blow.
**4. Points should be awarded where ring generalship is conspicuous. The comprises such points as the ability to quickly grasp and take advantage of every opportunity offered, the capacity to cope with all kinds of situations which may arise; to foresee and neutralize an opponent's method of attack; to force an opponent to adopt a style of boxing at which he is not particularly skillful.
**5. It is advisable to deduct points when a contestant persistently delays the action of a contest by clinching and lack of aggressiveness.
**6. Points should be deducted for a foul even though it is unintentional and not of a serious nature to warrant disqualification.
**7. A contestant should be given credit for sportsmanlike actions in the ring, close adherence to the spirit as well as the letter of the rules and for refraining from taking technical advantage of situations unfair to an opponent.
**8. In order to arrive at a true conclusion every point should be carefully observed and noted as the contest progresses, the decision going to the contestant who scores the greatest number of effective points regardless of the number of rounds won or lost.
*When neither contestant has a decided margin in effectiveness, the winner should be determined on points scored and aggressiveness.

The '''Nigeria bobsled team''' or '''Nigerian bobsleigh team''', represents [[Nigeria]] in [[bobsledding]]. The first team was established in 2016 by [[Seun Adigun]], as a women's team for the 2-women event. In 2017, they qualified to be the first Nigerians at the Winter Olympics, and first Africans in bobsled at the Winter Olympics.&lt;ref name=NYT-2018-03-06&gt; {{cite news |url= https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/01/31/magazine/winter-olympics-bobsled-nigerian-seun-adigun.html |title= The First African Team to Compete in Bobsled |author= Jaime Lowe |publisher= New York Times |date= 6 March 2018 }} &lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The first national team was established in 2016 by [[Seun Adigun]], in [[2-Person Bobsled|2-woman bobsleigh]]. The team was entirely self-funding, without financial support from Nigerian authorities. Raising the money to run the team showed the Nigerian government that they needed to establish a governing federation for bobsled, which they did, the [[Bobsled &amp; Skeleton Federation of Nigeria]] (BSFN). The team's first attempt to qualify for the [[Winter Olympics]], was in 2017, for the [[2018 Winter Olympics]] in [[Bobsleigh at the 2018 Winter Olympics|bobsledding]], the [[Bobsleigh at the 2018 Winter Olympics – Two-woman|two-women]] event. The 2018 Olympic team consisted of driver [[Seun Adigun]], and brakemen [[Ngozi Onwumere]] and [[Akuoma Omeoga]]. In November 2017, the team met the basic standard to participate in the qualifications. If the team qualifies, this would represent the first appearance of [[Nigeria at the Olympics|Nigeria]] at the Winter Olympics; and the first African team in bobsled. The team qualified for the Olympics, being [[Nigeria at the 2018 Winter Olympics|its representatives at the Winter Games]]. Nigeria became one of eight African countries to be represented at the 2018 Winter Olympics.&lt;ref name=ABCau-2017-11-17&gt; {{cite news |url= http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-11-17/nigerias-bobsled-team-off-to-winter-olympics/9163162 |title= Nigerian bobsled team will be country's first-ever Winter Olympics representatives |date= 17 November 2017 |publisher= ABC News (Australia) }} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; {{cite episode |airdate= 16 November 2017 |network= CTV |series= CTV National News }} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CBC-2017-11-17&gt; {{cite news |url= http://www.cbc.ca/sports/olympics/winter/bobsleigh/nigerian-womens-bobsled-team-olympics-1.4405884 |title= Nigerian women's bobsleigh team hope to make history in Pyeongchang |author= Wendy-Anne Clarke |date= 17 November 2017 |publisher= CBC News }} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WashPost-2017-11-17&gt; {{cite news |url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/early-lead/wp/2017/11/17/nigerian-women-become-first-african-bobsled-team-to-qualify-for-olympics/?tid=sm_tw |title= Nigerian women become first African bobsled team to qualify for Olympics |author= Marissa Payne |date= 17 November 2017 |publisher= Washington Post }} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NPR-2018-02-20&gt; {{cite news |author= Linus Unah |title= So How Excited Is Nigeria About Its History-Making Women's Bobsled Team? |url= https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2018/02/20/587252058/so-how-excited-is-nigeria-about-its-history-making-womens-bobsled-team |date= 20 February 2018 |publisher= NPR }} &lt;/ref&gt; Onwumere carried the Nigerian flag at the [[2018 Winter Olympics opening ceremony]] [[2018 Winter Olympics Parade of Nations|Parade of Nations]], and marched with her two teammates, along with fellow Nigerian [[Simidele Adeagbo]], who qualified for women's skeleton.&lt;ref name=Time-2018-02-10&gt; {{cite news |url= http://time.com/5142773/nigerian-bobsled-team-opening-ceremony-winter-olympics-2018/ |author= Jennifer Calfas |title= Nigeria’s First-Ever Bobsled Team Has Arrived at the Winter Olympics Opening Ceremony and People Are Really Excited |date= 10 February 2018 |publisher= Time Magazine }} &lt;/ref&gt; The team finished last among the 20 teams who competed.&lt;ref name=HoustonChronicle-2018-03-22&gt; {{cite news |url= https://www.houstonchronicle.com/sports/texas-sports-nation/article/As-one-journey-ends-another-begins-for-Nigerian-12773995.php |title= As one journey ends, another begins for Nigerian bobsledders |author= Melanie Hauser |date= 22 March 2018 |publisher= Houston Chronicle }} &lt;/ref&gt; After the Games, the 3 on the team retired from bobsled, but pledged to develop the sport in Nigeria, grow the Nigerian sporting federation, and grow winter sports and the Winter Olympics in Africa.&lt;ref name=HoustonChronicle-2018-03-22/&gt;

'''Pony''' is a brand of [[footwear]] and other [[clothing]]. It was founded in the [[United States]] and is now headquartered in [[Hong Kong]] under the company name '''Pony International'''.&lt;ref name="hk"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://pony-international.com/contact-us/ |title=Our Headquarter [sic] |publisher=Pony International |accessdate=10 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Founded in 1972 on Madison Avenue in [[New York City]], Pony was created by industry veteran (and Uruguayan-born&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nylon.com/articles/pony-spring-14-collection&lt;/ref&gt;) Roberto Muller, along with financing provided by adidas Chairman [[Horst Dassler]]. Pony became one of the top athletic brands worldwide. By the mid-1980s, Pony's sales volume reached US$800 million. The Pony brand has been worn by championship athletes in every major sport, including the [[FIFA World Cup]], the [[National Football League|NFL]]'s [[Super Bowl]], the [[Canadian Football League|CFL]]'s [[Grey Cup]], [[Major League Baseball|MLB]]'s [[World Series]], and the [[NBA Finals]].

Pony was owned by the English-based company Pentland in the 1990s before a sale to [[The Firm, Inc.|The Firm]] entertainment group, based in [[Santa Monica, California]]. The Firm relaunched the brand in 2001 with celebrity entertainers including [[Justin Timberlake]], [[Korn]], [[Snoop Dogg]] and [[Paris Hilton]].

In 2003, Global Brand Marketing, based in [[Santa Barbara, California]], acquired a majority share of Pony, along with Symphony Holdings and [[Itochu Corporation]]. In 2006, Pony was purchased by Symphony Holdings, a public company based in Hong Kong. Symphony brought in former partner Infinity Associates (Mardy Cason and Bill Simon), who were the principals who purchased [[Converse (shoe company)|Converse]] from bankruptcy in 2001, turned the brand around and sold to [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] in 2003 for $305 million. Jim Stroesser, who was the key partner in rebuilding Converse, was asked to be the CEO/President of Pony in 2006. Stroesser's team relocated Pony from Santa Barbara, CA, to downtown San Diego, CA. Pony was in need of a complete turnaround, and Stroesser's team rebuilt the company's infrastructure and positioned the brand as one of America's most authentic sports brands. In 2010 the company's U.S. headquarters were moved to [[Los Angeles]].

==Offerings==
Originally Pony was known for producing athletic footwear. The company expanded its offerings to include sports clothing, and has more recently produced [[streetwear]].

The '''Pyynikki Circuit''' or '''Tampere Circuit''' is a former [[street circuit]] in [[Tampere]], [[Finland]]. The circuit was a {{convert|3.608|km|sigfig=4}} long clockwise circuit in a park (or on public streets) in the district of [[Pyynikki]]. The roadraces were known as "Pyynikinajot" and were first run from 1932-1939. After an interruption caused by the [[Second World War]] they were revived in 1946, running until 1971. 

For the [[1962 Grand Prix motorcycle racing season|1962]] and [[1963 Grand Prix motorcycle racing season|1963]] seasons the [[Finnish motorcycle Grand Prix|Finnish Motorcycle Grand Prix]], a round of the [[Grand Prix motorcycle racing]] world championship, was held on the Pyynikki Circuit. The circuit was found to be too narrow, and therefore the Finnish Grand Prix was moved to the [[Imatra Circuit]] from [[1964 Grand Prix motorcycle racing season|1964]].

Races on the Pyynikki Circuit were banned in 1971 for safety reasons, but in the final year the future [[List of Grand Prix motorcycle racing World champions|World Champion]] [[Jarno Saarinen]] won two classes.

'''Richard Edmeads''' (dates unknown) was an English [[Amateur status in first-class cricket#Distinction between amateurs and professionals|professional]] [[cricket]]er who played in [[first-class cricket]] for [[Chertsey Cricket Club]] and [[Surrey county cricket teams|Surrey]] during the 1760s. The brother of [[John Edmeads]], he is recorded in the Richmond v. Chertsey match on [[Richmond Green]] in September 1765. He and his brother shared 108 runs in the match which Chertsey won by 106 runs.&lt;ref&gt;Waghorn, p.59.&lt;/ref&gt;

As Edmeads had established his reputation by 1765, he must have been active for some years previously and his career may have begun in the 1750s. He is not mentioned in 1770s reports although his brother continued to be a notable player in that decade. Very few players were mentioned by name in contemporary reports before the 1770s and there are no other references to Richard Edmeads.

[[File:Babe Ruth2.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Babe Ruth]] holds the [[Major League Baseball|MLB]] career slugging percentage record (.690).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/leaders/slugging_perc_career.shtml|title=Career Leaders &amp; Records for Slugging %|publisher=Baseball Reference|accessdate=2014-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In [[baseball statistics]], '''slugging percentage''' ('''SLG''') is a measure of the batting productivity of a [[batting (baseball)|hitter]]. It is calculated as [[total bases]] divided by [[at bat]]s, through the following formula, where ''AB'' is the number of at bats for a given player, and ''1B'', ''2B'', ''3B'', and ''HR'' are the number of [[single (baseball)|singles]], [[double (baseball)|doubles]], [[triple (baseball)|triples]], and [[home run]]s, respectively: 

: &lt;math&gt; \mathrm{SLG} = \frac{(\mathit{1B}) + (2 \times \mathit{2B}) + (3 \times \mathit{3B}) + (4 \times \mathit{HR})}{AB}&lt;/math&gt;

Unlike [[batting average]], slugging percentage gives more weight to [[Extra-base hit|extra-base hits]] such as doubles and home runs, relative to singles. [[Base on balls|Walks]] are specifically excluded from this calculation, as a [[plate appearance]] that ends in a walk is not counted as an at bat.

The name is a [[misnomer]], as the statistic is not a [[percentage]] but a scale of [[Measure (mathematics)|measure]] whose computed value is a number from 0 to 4. The statistic gives a double twice the value of a single, a triple three times the value, and a homerun four times.&lt;ref name="Baseball Scorekeeping: A Practical Guide, 2003"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=AikEnbLTOF0C&amp;pg=PA243&amp;dq=%22slugging+percentage%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjem9Hym-zZAhVHZawKHT3uAdwQ6AEIXTAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22slugging%20percentage%22&amp;f=false Baseball Scorekeeping: A Practical Guide to the Rules], Andres Wirkmaa, Jefferson, North Carolina, London: McFarland &amp; Company, Inc., Publishers, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

A slugging percentage is always expressed as a [[decimal]] to three decimal places, and is generally spoken as if multiplied by 1000. For example, a slugging percentage of .589 would be spoken as "five eighty nine."

In [[2016 Major League Baseball season|2016]], the mean average SLG among all batters in [[Major League Baseball]] was .417.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fangraphs.com/leaders.aspx?pos=all&amp;stats=bat&amp;lg=all&amp;qual=0&amp;type=8&amp;season=2016&amp;month=0&amp;season1=2016&amp;ind=0&amp;team=0,ss&amp;rost=0&amp;age=0&amp;filter=&amp;players=0|title=Major League Total Stats » 2016 » Batters » Dashboard {{!}} FanGraphs Baseball|website=www.fangraphs.com|access-date=2017-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Example calculation ==
For example, in 1920, [[Babe Ruth]] played his first season for the [[New York Yankees]]. In 458 at bats, Ruth had 172 hits, comprising 73 singles, 36 doubles, 9 triples, and 54 home runs, which brings the total base count to {{nowrap|1=(73 × 1) + (36 × 2) + (9 × 3) + (54 × 4) = 388}}. His total number of bases (388) divided by his total at-bats (458) is .847 which constitutes his slugging percentage for the season. This also set a record for Ruth which stood until [[2001 in baseball|2001]] when [[Barry Bonds]] achieved 411 bases in 476 at-bats bringing his slugging percentage to&amp;nbsp;.863, which has been unmatched since.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/leaders/slugging_perc_season.shtml|title=Single-Season Leaders &amp; Records for Slugging %|publisher=Baseball Reference|accessdate=2016-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance==
Long after it was first invented, slugging percentage gained new significance when baseball analysts realized that it combined with [[on-base percentage]] (OBP) to form a very good measure of a player's overall offensive production (in fact, OBP + SLG was originally referred to as "production" by baseball writer and statistician [[Bill James]]). A predecessor metric was developed by [[Branch Rickey]] in 1954. Rickey, in ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine, suggested that combining OBP with what he called "extra base power" (EBP) would give a better indicator of player performance than typical [[Major League Baseball Triple Crown|Triple Crown]] stats. EBP was a predecessor to slugging percentage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://old.nationalreview.com/weekend/play-ball/pb-lewis033101.shtml|title=Lies, Damn Lies, and RBIs|accessdate=2012-07-01|date=2001-03-31|first=Dan|last=Lewis|publisher=nationalreview.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020211628/http://old.nationalreview.com/weekend/play-ball/pb-lewis033101.shtml|archivedate=2012-10-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Allen Barra]] and [[George Ignatin]] were early adopters in combining the two modern-day statistics, multiplying them together to form what is now known as "SLOB" (Slugging × On-Base).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/news/sports/col/barra/2001/06/20/bonds/print.html|title=The best season ever?|accessdate= 2007-07-15|date= 2001-06-20|first=Allen|last= Barra|publisher=Salon.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bill James]] applied this principle to his [[runs created]] formula several years later (and perhaps independently), essentially multiplying SLOB × At-Bats to create the formula:

: &lt;math&gt;\text{RC}=\frac{(\text{hits}+\text{walks})\times(\text{total bases})}{(\text{at-bats}) + (\text{walks})}&lt;/math&gt;

In 1984, [[Pete Palmer]] and [[John Thorn]] developed perhaps the most widespread means of combining slugging and on-base percentage: [[On-base plus slugging]] (OPS), which is a simple addition of the two values. Because it is easy to calculate, OPS has been used with increased frequency in recent years as a shorthand form to evaluate contributions as a [[Batting (baseball)|batter]].

In a 2015 article, Bryan Grosnick made the point that "on base" and "slugging" may not be comparable enough to be simply added together. "On base" has a theoretical maximum of 1.000 whereas "slugging" has a theoretical maximum of 4.000. The actual numbers don't show as big a difference of course, with Grosnick listing .350 as a good "on base" and .430 as a good "slugging."  He goes on to say that OPS has the advantages of simplicity and availability and further states, "you'll probably get it 75% right, at least."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.beyondtheboxscore.com/2015/9/18/9329763/separate-but-not-quite-equal-why-ops-is-a-bad-statistic Separate but not quite equal: Why OPS is a "bad" statistic], Bryan Grosnick, Beyond the Box Score, Sept. 18, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Perfect slugging percentage==
The maximum numerically possible slugging percentage is 4.000.&lt;ref name="Baseball Scorekeeping: A Practical Guide, 2003"/&gt; A number of MLB players (117 through the end of the 2016 season) have momentarily had a 4.000 career slugging percentage by [[List of Major League Baseball players with a home run in their first major league at bat|homering in their first major league at-bat]]. Hundreds of other players have momentarily held a 4.000 percentage for a season by hitting a home run in their first at-bat of the season. 

No player has ever retired with a 4.000 slugging percentage, but four players tripled in their only MLB at-bat and therefore share the record of a career slugging percentage of 3.000 (when evaluated without regard to a minimum number of games played or plate appearances). The players are [[Eric Cammack]] (2000 Mets), [[Scott Munninghoff]] (1980 Phillies), [[Eduardo Rodríguez (right-handed pitcher)|Eduardo Rodríguez]] (1973 Brewers), and [[Charlie Lindstrom]] (1958 White Sox).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/baseball/2010/05/29/2010-05-29_baseballs_triple_threats.html |location=New York |work=[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]] |title=Ex-Met Eric Cammack is one of only four players to post career slugging percentage of 3.000 |first=Jesse |last=Spector |date=2010-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is played on a rectangular [[Billiard table#Snooker tables|table]] covered with a green cloth, or [[baize]], with [[Billiard table#Pockets 2|pockets]] at each of the four corners and in the middle of each long side. Using a [[cue stick|cue]] and 22 [[Billiard ball#Snooker|coloured ball]]s, players must strike the white ball (or "cue ball") to {{glossary link|glossary=Glossary of cue sports terms|pot}} the remaining balls in the correct sequence, accumulating points for each pot. An individual game, or frame, is won by the player who scores the most points. A match is won when a player wins a predetermined number of frames.

Snooker gained its own identity in 1884 when army officer [[Neville Francis Fitzgerald Chamberlain|Sir Neville Chamberlain]] (not the [[Neville Chamberlain|Prime Minister]] of that name), while stationed in [[Ooty]], devised a set of rules that combined [[pyramid pool|pyramid]] and [[life pool]].&lt;ref name="Neville Chamberlain disambiguation"&gt; {{cite web |url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neville_Chamberlain_(disambiguation) |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2018-05-03 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070601033451/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neville_Chamberlain_(disambiguation) |archivedate=1 June 2007 |df=dmy-all }}, retrieved 25 February 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The word "snooker" was a long-used military term used to describe inexperienced or first-year personnel. The game grew in popularity in England, and the Billiards Association and Control Club was formed in 1919. It is now governed by the [[World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association]] (WPBSA).

The [[World Snooker Championship]] has taken place since [[1927 World Snooker Championship|1927]], with [[Joe Davis]] becoming a key figure in the early growth of the sport with 15 championship wins from 1927 to 1946. The modern era began in 1969 after the [[BBC]] commissioned the snooker television show ''[[Pot Black]]'' and began to air the World Championship in [[1978 World Snooker Championship|1978]], leading to the sport's new peak in popularity. [[Ray Reardon]] dominated the game in the 1970s, [[Steve Davis]] in the 1980s, and [[Stephen Hendry]] in the 1990s; [[Ronnie O'Sullivan]] has won the most world titles since 2000.

==History==
{{Main article|History of snooker}}
[[File:Neville Francis Fitzgerald Chamberlain.png|thumb|right|upright|[[Neville Francis Fitzgerald Chamberlain|Sir Neville Chamberlain]], a British Army officer who devised the game and its rules in the late 19th century.]]
The origin of snooker dates back to the latter half of the 19th century.&lt;ref name="origins"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/sporting-vernacular-11-snooker-1089731.html|first=Chris|last=Maume|title=Sporting Vernacular 11.

One such variation originated at the officers' [[mess]] of the 11th [[Devonshire Regiment]] in 1875,&lt;ref name=heritage2008&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snookerheritage.co.uk/normans-articles/days-of-old/origins-of-snooker/|title=Origins of Snooker|first=Peter|last=Clare|date=2008|publisher=Snooker Heritage|accessdate=8 February 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170103150005/http://snookerheritage.co.uk/normans-articles/days-of-old/origins-of-snooker/|archivedate=3 January 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; which combined the rules of two [[pocket billiards]] games, [[pyramid pool|pyramid]] and [[life pool]]. The former was played with fifteen red balls and one black positioned in a triangle, while the latter involved the potting of designated coloured balls.&lt;ref name="jothiarun's balls book of billiards"&gt;Shamos, Mike (1993), ''The Complete Book of Billiards''. {{ISBN|0-517-20869-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game developed its own identity in 1884 when its first set of rules was finalised by [[Neville Francis Fitzgerald Chamberlain|Sir Neville Chamberlain]], an English officer who helped develop and popularise the game at [[Stone House, Ooty|Stone House]] in [[Ooty]] on a table built by Burroughes &amp; Watts that was brought over by boat.&lt;ref name=telegraph2014&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/asia/india/articles/Ooty-India-back-in-time-to-the-birthplace-of-snooker/|title=Ooty, India: back in time to the birthplace of snooker|date=16 June 2014|work=The Telegraph|first=Martin|last=Hughes-Games|accessdate=8 February 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170321074803/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/asia/india/articles/Ooty-India-back-in-time-to-the-birthplace-of-snooker/|archivedate=21 March 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The word "snooker" was a slang term for first-year cadets and inexperienced military personnel, but Chamberlain would often use it to describe the inept performance of one of his fellow officers at the table. The name instantly stuck with the players.&lt;ref name="origins"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jothiarun's balls book of billiards" /&gt;&lt;ref name="titan"&gt;{{cite web |author= |title=Origins of the Game of Snooker |url= http://www.titansports.co.uk/history/snooker.htm |work=TitanSports.co.uk |date= |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20051215154838/http://www.titansports.co.uk/history/snooker.htm |archive-date=15 December 2005 |dead-url=yes |access-date=13 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source|certain=y|date=November 2017|reason=Just some unknown-author rambling on vendor website. There are real sources for this out there.}} In 1887, snooker was given its first definite reference in England in a copy of ''[[Sporting Life (British newspaper)|Sporting Life]]'' which caused a growth in popularity.&lt;ref name=heritage2008/&gt; Chamberlain came out as the game's inventor in a letter to ''[[The Field (magazine)|The Field]]'' published on 19 March 1938, 63 years after the fact.&lt;ref name=heritage2008/&gt;

Snooker grew in popularity across the Indian colonies and the United Kingdom, but it remained a game mainly for the [[gentry]], and many gentlemen's clubs that had a billiards table would not allow non-members inside to play. To accommodate the growing interest, smaller and more open snooker-specific clubs were formed. In 1919, the Billiards Association and the Billiards Control Board merged to form the Billiards Association and Control Club (BA&amp;CC) and a new, standard set of rules for snooker first became official.{{sfn|Gadsby|Williams|2012|p=8}}

The game of snooker grew in the latter half of the 19th century and the early 20th century, and by [[1927 World Snooker Championship|1927]] the first [[World Snooker Championship]]&lt;ref name="origins" /&gt; had been organised by [[Joe Davis]] who, as a professional [[English billiards]] and snooker player, moved the game from a [[Hobby|pastime]] activity into a more professional sphere.&lt;ref name="CnVTimeline"&gt;unknown author [http://www.cuesnviews.co.uk/Snooker/timeline.htm "Snooker Timeline"] ''"Joe Davis will reinvent this after-dinner pastime and become world champion"'', cuesnviews.co.uk, unknown date, (Retrieved 24 February 2007), ([https://web.archive.org/web/20060216115629/http://www.cuesnviews.co.uk/Snooker/timeline.htm Archive Version])&lt;/ref&gt; Davis won every world championship until 1946 when he retired. The game went into a decline through the 1950s and 1960s with little interest generated outside of those who played. In 1959, Davis introduced a variation of the game known as "snooker plus" (see the ''Variations'' section below) to try to improve the game's popularity by adding two extra colours, but it never caught on.

A major advance occurred in 1969, when [[David Attenborough]] commissioned the snooker television series ''[[Pot Black]]'' to demonstrate the potential of [[Color television#Europe|colour television]] with the green table and multi-coloured balls being ideal for showing off the advantages of colour broadcasting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/snooker/4382776.stm "Pot Black returns"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061117104945/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/snooker/4382776.stm |date=17 November 2006 }}, BBC Sport, 27 October 2005.

==Rules==
{{Main article|Rules of snooker}}
[[File:Snooker table drawing 2.svg|thumb|[[Billiard table#Snooker tables|Snooker table]] with balls placed in their starting positions. At the start of the game, the cue ball (white) may be placed anywhere in the semicircle, known as the "D".]]
[[File:To pot the red.jpg|thumb|left|Game in progress on a half-size table. A red ball about to be potted.]]
The objective of the game is to score more {{Cuegloss|Point|points}} than one's opponent by potting {{Cuegloss|Object ball|object balls}} in the correct order. At the start of a frame, the balls are positioned as shown, and the players then take turns to hit shots by striking the cue ball with the {{Cuegloss|Cue tip|tip}} of the [[Cue stick|cue]], their aim being to pot one of the red balls into a pocket and thereby score a point, or, if this is not possible, to at least hit a red ball so as to avoid making a foul shot. If the striker pots a red ball, he or she must then pot one of the six "colours" (in snooker, the term ''colour'' is understood to exclude the red balls). If the player successfully pots a colour, the value of that ball is added to the player's score, and the ball is returned to its starting position on the table. After that, the player must pot another red ball, then another colour, and so on. This process continues until the striker fails to pot the desired ball, at which point the opponent comes to the table to play the next shot.

The game continues in this manner until all the reds are potted and only the six colours are left on the table. At this point the colours must be potted in the order from least to most valuable ball&amp;nbsp;– that is, yellow first (two points), then green (three points), brown (four points), blue (five points), pink (six points) and finally black (seven points), the balls not being returned to play. When the final ball is potted, the player with more points wins.&lt;ref name="wsrulessnooker"&gt;{{cite web|title=Official Rules of the Games of Snooker and English Billiards |url=http://www.wpbsa.com/sites/default/files/uploads/official_rules_edited_05.11.14_web_version_1.pdf |publisher=[[World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association|The World Professional Billiards &amp; Snooker Association Limited]] |date=November 2014 |accessdate=23 April 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304084316/http://www.wpbsa.com/sites/default/files/uploads/official_rules_edited_05.11.14_web_version_1.pdf |archivedate=4 March 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; If the scores are equal when all the balls have been potted, the black is placed back on its spot as a [[tiebreaker]]. A player may also concede a frame while on strike if he or she thinks there are not enough points available on the table to beat the opponent's score. In professional snooker this is a common occurrence.

Points may also be scored in a game when a player's opponent {{Cuegloss|Foul|fouls}}. A foul can occur for various reasons, most commonly for failing to hit the correct ball (e.g. hitting a colour first when the player was attempting to hit a red), or for sending the cue ball into a pocket. The former may occur when the player fails to escape from "{{Cuegloss|Snooker|a snooker}}"&amp;nbsp;– a situation in which the previous player leaves the cue ball positioned such that no legal ball can be struck directly without obstruction by an illegal ball. Points gained from a foul vary from a minimum of four, to a maximum of seven if the black ball is involved.&lt;ref name="wsrulessnooker" /&gt;

The total number of consecutive points (excluding fouls) that a player amasses during one {{Cuegloss|Visit|visit}} to the table is known as a "{{Cuegloss|Break|break}}". A player attaining a break of 15, for example, could have reached it by potting a red then a black, then a red then a pink, before failing to pot the next red. The traditional [[maximum break]] in snooker is achieved by potting all reds with blacks then all colours, yielding 147 points; this is often known as a "147" or a "maximum".&lt;ref name="BBC147"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/snooker/6260923.stm "Ding compiles maximum at Masters"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070207225605/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/snooker/6260923.stm |date=7 February 2007 }}, BBC Sport, (Retrieved 24 February 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; The highest possible break is a [[Maximum break#Breaks exceeding 147|155 break]], also known as a "super maximum". This is achieved via the opponent leaving a {{Cuegloss|free ball}}, with the black being potted as the additional colour, and then potting 15 reds and blacks with the colours. [[Jamie Cope]] has the distinction of being the first player in snooker history to post a verified 155 break, achieved in a practice frame in 2005.

One {{Cuegloss|Game|game}}, from the balls in their starting position until the last ball is potted, is called a "{{Cuegloss|Frame|frame}}". A {{Cuegloss|Match|match}} generally consists of a predetermined number of frames and the player who wins the most frames wins the match. Most professional matches require a player to win five frames, and are called "best of nine" as that is the maximum possible number of frames. Tournament finals are usually best of 17 or best of 19, while the world championship uses longer matches&amp;nbsp;– ranging from best of 19 in the qualifiers and the first round proper, up to 35 frames in length (first to 18), and is played over two days, extended if necessary until a winner is determined.&lt;ref name="BBCWSN1"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/snooker/4963842.stm "World title victory delights Dott"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070307030914/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/snooker/4963842.stm |date=7 March 2007 }}, BBC Sport, (Retrieved 24 February 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

Professional and competitive amateur matches are officiated by a referee who is the sole judge of fair play. The referee also replaces the colours on the table when necessary and calls out how many points the player has scored during a break. Professional players usually play the game in a sporting manner, declaring fouls the referee has missed, acknowledging good shots from their opponent, or holding up a hand to apologise for fortunate shots, also known as "flukes".

[[#Equipment|Accessories]] used for snooker include {{Cuegloss|Chalk|chalk}} for the tip of the cue, {{Cuegloss|Rest|rests}} of various sorts (needed often, due to the length of a full-size table), a [[Rack (billiards)|triangle]] to {{Cuegloss|Rack|rack}} the reds, and a scoreboard. One drawback of snooker on a full-size (12&amp;nbsp;ft × 6&amp;nbsp;ft) table is the size of the room ({{convert|22|x|16|ft|m}}), which is the minimum required for comfortable cueing room on all sides.&lt;ref name="roomsize"&gt;Peter Ietswaart, [http://www.thurstonsnooker.co.uk/Pages/Snookerfaq.html "Thurston Snooker Table makers"], ''Recommended room size for full size table 22&amp;nbsp;ft × 16&amp;nbsp;ft'', unknown date, (Retrieved 25 February 2007), ([https://web.archive.org/web/20060503151323/http://www.thurstonsnooker.co.uk/Pages/Snookerfaq.html Archive Version])&lt;/ref&gt; This limits the number of locations in which the game can easily be played. While [[Billiard table#Pool (pocket billiards) tables|pool tables]] are common to many [[Public house|pubs]], snooker tends to be played either in private surroundings or in public [[Billiard hall|snooker halls]]. The game can also be played on smaller tables using fewer red balls. The variants in table size are: 10&amp;nbsp;ft × 5&amp;nbsp;ft, 9&amp;nbsp;ft × 4.5&amp;nbsp;ft, 8&amp;nbsp;ft × 4&amp;nbsp;ft, 6&amp;nbsp;ft × 3&amp;nbsp;ft (the smallest for realistic play) and 4&amp;nbsp;ft × 2&amp;nbsp;ft. Smaller tables can come in a variety of styles, such as fold-away or dining-table convertible.

A traditional snooker scoreboard resembles an abacus, and records units, tens and hundreds via horizontal sliding pointers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sportsdefinitions.com/snooker/Scoreboard.html|title=What is Scoreboard in Snooker?

A simple scoring bead is also sometimes used, called a "scoring string", or "scoring wire". Each bead (segment of the string) represents a single point. Snooker players typically move one or several beads with their cue.

===Tournaments===
Professional snooker players can play on the [[World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association|World Snooker]] main tour ranking circuit. [[Snooker world rankings|Ranking points]], earned by players through their performances over the previous two seasons, determine the current world rankings.&lt;ref name="WSrankingchart"&gt;WPBSA [http://www.worldsnooker.com/pdfs/WSAPointsSchedule0910.pdf "Professional Tour ranking points"], ''World Snooker'', (Retrieved 25 January 2010)  {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; A player's ranking determines what level of qualification he or she requires for ranking tournaments.

[[File:World Snooker Championship Trophy edited.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|[[World Snooker Championship]] trophy]]
The most important event in professional snooker is the world championship,&lt;ref name="wsc1"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/snooker/4963842.stm "World title victory delights Dott"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070307030914/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/snooker/4963842.stm |date=7 March 2007 }}, BBC Sport, 2 May 2006, (Retrieved 25 February 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; held annually since 1927 (except during [[World War II]] and between 1958 and 1963). The tournament has been held at the [[Crucible Theatre]] in [[Sheffield]], England, since 1977, and was sponsored by [[Imperial Tobacco|Embassy]] from 1976 to 2005.&lt;ref name="GuardianSponsor" /&gt; Since 2005, tobacco companies have not been allowed to sponsor sporting events in the United Kingdom, and the world championship has had to find a new sponsor. It was announced in January 2006 that the 2006–2010 world championships would be sponsored by online casino [[888 Holdings|888.com]]. The championship is currently sponsored by [[Betfred]].com after 888.com pulled out of their five-year sponsorship deal after three years.&lt;ref name="sponsor"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/snooker/7544214.stm "Huge financial blow hits snooker"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090413043257/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/snooker/7544214.stm |date=13 April 2009 }}, BBC Sport, 6 August 2008, (Retrieved 6 August 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;
On 15 April 2009 the World Snooker Championship website announced that Betfred.com would be the new sponsor of the world championship for the next four years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/snooker/4614824.stm "Crucible event gets new sponsor"], BBC Sport, 15 January 2006, (Retrieved 25 February 2007), ([https://web.archive.org/web/20060213033340/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/snooker/4614824.stm Archive Version])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldsnooker.com/ws_announcements-54293.htm World Snooker Announcements: Betfred.com Named Title Sponsor for the World Snooker Championship] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120619152931/http://www.worldsnooker.com/ws_announcements-54293.htm |date=19 June 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The world championship is televised extensively in the UK by the [[BBC]]&lt;ref name="bbc_deal"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/snooker/4378346.stm "Snooker signs five-year BBC deal"], BBC Sport, 26 October 2005, (Retrieved 25 February 2007), ([https://web.archive.org/web/20060223074307/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/snooker/4378346.stm Archive Version])&lt;/ref&gt; and gains significant coverage in Europe on [[Eurosport]]&lt;ref name="eurosport_deal"&gt;[http://media.guardian.co.uk/broadcast/story/0,,1762954,00.html "Eurosport pots TV snooker rights"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070901023629/http://media.guardian.co.uk/broadcast/story/0,,1762954,00.html |date=1 September 2007 }}, ''The Guardian'', 27 April 2006, (Retrieved 25 February 2007, registration or [[BugMeNot]] required)&lt;/ref&gt; and in the Far East.

The group of tournaments that come next in importance are the other ranking tournaments. Players in these tournaments score [[Snooker world rankings|world ranking points]]. A high ranking ensures qualification for the next year's tournaments, opportunities to play in  invitational tournaments and an advantageous draw in tournaments.&lt;ref name="top16-1" /&gt; The most prestigious of these, after the world championship, is the [[UK Championship (snooker)|UK Championship]]. Third in line are the invitational tournaments, to which most of the highest ranked players are invited. The most important tournament in this category is [[Masters (snooker)|the Masters]],&lt;ref name=masters1&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/snooker/4611510.stm "Snooker finds new Masters sponsor"], BBC Sport, 13 January 2006, (Retrieved 25 February 2007, ([https://web.archive.org/web/20060213033334/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/snooker/4611510.stm Archive Version])&lt;/ref&gt; which to most players is the second or third most sought-after prize.&lt;ref name="dottmasters"&gt;Harris, N. [http://sport.independent.co.uk/general/article2154851.ece "An email conversation with Graeme Dott: 'We need an Abramovich to take the game to a new level"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071119182025/https://sport.independent.co.uk/general/article2154851.ece |date=19 November 2007 }}, ''The Independent'', 15 January 2007, (Retrieved 25 February 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

In an attempt to answer criticisms that televised matches can be slow or get bogged down in lengthy safety exchanges and that long matches cause problems for advertisers,&lt;ref name="yawn"&gt;Ronay, B. [https://www.theguardian.com/g2/story/0,,1932634,00.html "Too dull to miss"], ''The Guardian'', 27 October 2006, (Retrieved 25 February 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; an alternative series of timed tournaments has been organised by [[Matchroom Sport]] chairman [[Barry Hearn]]. The shot-timed [[Premier League Snooker]] was established, with seven players invited to compete at regular United Kingdom venues, televised on [[Sky Sports]]. Players had twenty-five seconds to take each shot, with five time-outs per player per match. While some success was achieved with this format, it generally did not receive the same amount of press attention or status as the regular ranking tournaments. However, this event has been taken out of the tour since 2013, when the [[Champion of Champions (snooker)|Champion of Champions]] was established.

There are also other tournaments that have less importance, earn no world ranking points and are not televised. These can change on a year-to-year basis depending on calendars and sponsors.

In 2015, the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association submitted an unsuccessful bid for snooker to be played at the [[2020 Summer Olympics]] in Tokyo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Snooker bids to be included in 2020 Olympics in Tokyo|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/snooker/30942350|accessdate=24 January 2015|work=BBC Sport|date=23 January 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150123151806/http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/snooker/30942350|archivedate=23 January 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Olympic Games: Snooker misses out on 2020 Tokyo place|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/olympics/33223492|work=BBC Sport | date =22 June 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another bid has been put forward for [[2024 Summer Olympics|Paris 2024]] through the newly formed '''[[World Snooker Federation]]'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Reuters staff | title = Snooker among cue sports targeting Paris 2024, federation chief says | url = https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-olympics-snooker/snooker-among-cue-sports-targeting-paris-2024-federation-chief-says-idUKKBN1D82AO | work = Reuters | date = 8 November 2017 | access-date = 8 May 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = About | url = https://www.worldsnookerfederation.org/about/ | website = worldsnookerfederation | publisher = World Snooker Federation | access-date = 8 May 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticism===
Several players, such as Ronnie O'Sullivan, Mark Allen and Steve Davis, have warned that there are so many tournaments that players risk burning out. In 2012, O'Sullivan played fewer tournaments in order to spend more time with his children, and ended the 2012–13 season ranked No. 19 in the world. Furthermore, he did not play any tournament in 2013 except the world championship, which he won.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/general/others/snooker-ronnie-osullivan-warns-of-players-burning-out-7718621.html Snooker: Ronnie O'Sullivan warns of players burning out] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171209044231/https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/general/others/snooker-ronnie-osullivan-warns-of-players-burning-out-7718621.html |date=9 December 2017 }}, The Independent, 7 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Anchor|List of snooker equipment}}

==Equipment==
[[File:London - Royal Automobile Club - 3024.jpg|thumb|right| Cue-tip chalk, cue, white chalk-board chalk, and a sliding score-keeper]]
; Table
: The playing surface, 11 feet 8.5 inches by 5 feet 10 inches for a standard full-size table, with six pocket holes, one at each corner and one at the centre of each of the longer side cushions. For further information see ''[[Billiard table]]'', specifically the section [[Billiard table#Snooker and English billiards tables|Snooker and English billiards tables]].
; Cloth
: The fully wool cloth is usually green, with a [[Billiard table#Cloth|directional nap]] running from the baulk end of the table towards the end with the black ball spot. The cloth is often called "baize"; however baize is a much inferior type of cloth sometimes used on pool tables. The nap will affect the direction of the cue ball depending on which direction the cue ball is shot and also on whether left or right side (spin) is placed on the ball. Even if the cue ball is hit in exactly the same way, the nap will cause a different effect depending on whether the ball is hit down table (towards the black ball spot) or up table towards the baulk line. The cloth on a snooker table is not vacuumed, as this can destroy the nap. The cloth is brushed in a straight line from the baulk end to the far end with multiple brush strokes that are straight in direction (i.e. not across the table). Some table men will also then drag a dampened cloth wrapped around a short piece of board (like a [[Dimensional lumber#Dimensional lumber|two by four]]), or straight back of a brush to collect any remaining fine dust and help lay the nap down. The table is then ironed. Strachan cloth as used in official snooker tournaments is made up of 100% wool. Some other cloths include a small percentage of nylon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wsptextiles.com/strachan-snooker-cloths|title=Strachan snooker cloths - WSP Textiles - Billiard and Tennis cloths|author=Milliken Industrials Limited - Woollen Speciality Products|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160209060450/http://www.wsptextiles.com/strachan-snooker-cloths|archivedate=9 February 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cues Cues"&gt;[Snooker], ''Cues Cues'', 10 July 2013, (Retrieved 20 July 2013), ([https://archive.is/20130720150135/http://www.cuescues.co.uk/snooker-cloth/Hainsworth-Smart-Snooker-Cloth?product_id=168])&lt;/ref&gt;
; Balls
:22 balls (15 red, 6 colour balls and a white cue ball), 52.5 mm or 2{{frac|1|16}} inches in diameter. For further information see ''[[Billiard ball]]'', particularly the section [[Billiard ball#Snooker|Snooker]].
; [[Cue stick|Cue]]
: A stick, made of wood or fibreglass, tapering to a tip, usually ending in leather, which is used to strike the cue-ball.
; [[Cue sports#Chalk|Cue-tip chalk]]
: The tip of the cue is "chalked" to ensure good contact between the cue and the cue-ball. This "chalk" is generally a silica-based compound rather than actual chalk of the type used on blackboards.
; Extension
: A shorter baton that fits over, or screws into, the back end of the cue, effectively lengthening it, used for shots where the cue ball is a long distance from the player.
; Rest
: A stick with an X-shaped head that is used to support the cue when the cue ball is out of reach at normal extension.
; Rest head adaptor
: An attachment that slips onto a conventional rest head to make a spider or to give a slightly different bridge.
; Hook rest
: Identical to the normal rest, yet with a hooked metal end. It is used to set the rest around another ball. The hook rest is the most recent invention in snooker.
; Spider
: Similar to the rest but with an arch-shaped head; it is used to elevate and support the tip of the cue above the height of the cue-ball.
; Swan (or swan-neck spider or giraffe)
: This equipment, consisting of a rest with a single extended neck and a fork-like prong at the end, is used to give extra cueing distance over a group of balls. If not available, a regular X rest can be placed on a spider so it in turn hangs the required distance beyond to provide similar support.
; Triangle/rack
: The piece of equipment is used for gathering the red balls into the formation required for the break to start a frame.
; Extended rest
: Similar to the regular rest, but with a mechanism at the butt end which makes it possible to extend the rest by up to three feet.
; Extended spider
: A hybrid of the swan and the spider. Its purpose is to bridge over large packs of reds. Is less common these days in professional snooker but can be used in situations where the position of one or more balls prevents the spider being placed where the striker desires.
; Half butt
: Usually housed underneath the side of the table, the half butt is a combination of a table length rest and cue which is rarely used unless the cue ball needs to be struck in such a way that the entire length of the table is the actual obstacle.
; Ball marker
: A multi-purpose instrument with a "D" shaped notch, which a referee can place next to a ball, in order to mark the position of it. They can then remove the ball to clean it; also used to judge if a ball is preventing a colour from being placed on its spot and to judge if the cue ball can hit the extreme edge of a "ball on" when awarding a free ball (by placing it alongside the potentially intervening ball).

In the professional era that began with [[Joe Davis]] in the 1930s and continues until the present day, a relatively small number of players have succeeded at the top level.&lt;ref name="number1"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/snooker/1980218.stm "O'Sullivan in exalted company"], BBC Sport, 10 May 2002, (Retrieved 25 February 2007), ([https://web.archive.org/web/20030827090701/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/snooker/1980218.stm Archive Version])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hardwork"&gt;Hunter, P. [http://news.bbc.co.uk/sportacademy/hi/sa/special_events/snooker/newsid_3986000/3986151.stm "Putting in the practice"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151215033918/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sportacademy/hi/sa/special_events/snooker/newsid_3986000/3986151.stm |date=15 December 2015 }}, BBC Sport, 5 November 2004, (Retrieved 25 February 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

Through the decades, certain players have tended to dominate the game, but none more than its original star player, Joe Davis. Davis was world champion for twenty years, retiring unbeaten after claiming his fifteenth world title in 1946 when the tournament was reinstated after the Second World War. Davis was unbeaten in world championship play, and was only ever beaten four times in his entire life, with all four defeats coming after his world championship retirement and inflicted by his own brother Fred. He did lose matches in handicapped tournaments, but on level terms these four defeats were the only losses of his entire career.&lt;ref&gt;Fred Davis Talking Snooker&lt;/ref&gt; He was also world billiards champion. It is regarded as highly unlikely that anyone will ever dominate the game to his level again.&lt;ref&gt;Clive Everton The history of snooker&lt;/ref&gt;
After Davis retired from world championship play, the next dominant force was his younger brother [[Fred Davis (snooker player)|Fred Davis]] who had lost the 1940 final by a single frame. By 1947 he was deemed ready by his brother to take over the mantle but lost the world final to the Scotsman [[Walter Donaldson]]. After this setback, Davis and Donaldson contested the next four finals, Davis proving the stronger player. After the abandonment of the world championship in 1953, with the 1952 final boycotted by British professionals, the Professional Match Play Championship became the unofficial world championship in all but name.&lt;ref&gt;Guinness Book of Snooker History of the World Championship&lt;/ref&gt; Fred Davis won the event every year until its penultimate one, when in 1957 he did not enter.
After winning three official and five unofficial world titles, his absence from the 1957 tournament was to prove vital, as its winner, John Pulman, was automatically awarded the official world title on resumption of the tournament in 1964. Davis would try, but never regain the world title again.

[[John Pulman]] was the king of the 1960s, when the world championship was played on a challenge basis. However, when the tournament reverted to a knockout formula in 1969, he did not prosper.  [[Ray Reardon]] became the dominant force in the 1970s, winning six titles, with [[John Spencer (snooker player)|John Spencer]] winning three.
[[Steve Davis]]' first world title in 1981 made him only the 11th world champion since 1927, including the winner of the boycotted 1952 title, Horace Lindrum. [[Stephen Hendry]] became the 14th in 1990 and dominated through the 1990s. Reardon won six (1970, 1973–1976 and 1978), Davis also six (1981, 1983, 1984 and 1987–1989) and Hendry seven (1990, 1992–1996 and 1999). [[Ronnie O'Sullivan]] is the closest to dominance in the modern era, having won the title on five occasions in the 21st century (2001, 2004, 2008, 2012 and 2013). [[Mark Williams (snooker player)|Mark Williams]] has won three times (2000, 2003, and 2018) and [[John Higgins (snooker player)|John Higgins]] four times (1998, 2007, 2009, 2011) but since the beginning of the century, there has not been a dominant force like in previous decades, and the modern era has seen many players playing to a similar standard, instead of one player raising the bar. Davis, for example, won more ranking tournaments than the rest of the top 64 players put together by 1985. By retaining his title in 2013, O'Sullivan became the first player to successfully defend the world championship since 1996 when Hendry won the sixth of his seven titles, his fifth in a row, and then later by [[Mark Selby]] in 2017.&lt;ref name="World Champions"&gt;[http://www.worldsnooker.com/world_championship10_history.htm?tid=154 "World Snooker Championship&amp;nbsp;– History"], ''World Snooker Official Site'', (Retrieved 9 April 2010) {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100528154608/http://www.worldsnooker.com/world_championship10_history.htm?tid=154 |date=28 May 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Variants==

'''Academia de Futbol Sporting San Miguelito''' is a [[Panama]]nian [[Football (soccer)|football]] team playing in [[Liga Panameña de Fútbol]] (the highest level of Panamanian football). It is based in [[San Miguelito, Panamá|San Miguelito]]. They played in [[Cancha de Entrenamiento Luis Tapia]]. They won their first Panamanian football title in [[2012-13 Liga Panameña de Fútbol season|Clausura 2013]]

==History==
===Sporting '89===
The club was founded in 1989 by Cesar Morales as ''Sporting '89''. They reached the top flight for the first time in [[Primera A 1997|1997]] by defeating [[Chorrillo F.C.|Chorrillo]] in a promotion playoff. They made their top tier debut on 19 July 1997 against [[Chiriquí F.C.|Chiriquí]].&lt;ref name=aniversario&gt;[http://sportingsm.com.pa/2014/02/el-sporting-san-miguelito-arriba-a-sus-veinticinco-aniversario/ EL SPORTING SAN MIGUELITO ARRIBA A SUS VEINTICINCO ANIVERSARIO]&amp;nbsp;– Sporting SM&lt;/ref&gt;

In the summer of 2002, the club changed its name to ''Sporting Coclé''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.panamaamerica.com.pa/content/sporting-cocl%C3%A9-busca-expandir-sus-horizontes Sporting Coclé busca expandir sus horizontes]&amp;nbsp;– Panamá América {{es|icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Five years later (2007), they changed their name again, adopting the name of San Miguelito, which remains the club title today.

Starting in 2011-2012, San Miguelito became a title contender.  They topped the table in the regular season of both Apertura 2011 and Clausura 2012 (although they were eliminated in the semifinals each time).  Then, in Clausura 2013, they claimed their first title by defeating San Francisco 4-1 in the championship final.  They also reached the finals of Apertura 2015.  Since then, results have declined, although the club has as of yet evaded relegation.

==Stadium==
They also played at different stadiums: starting at the [[Estadio Bernardo "Candela" Gil]], then the El Ciruelito” de Antón and the Estadio Luis Ernesto (Cascarita) Tapia but since the reign of chairman Lucas Aleman they play at the Estadio Oscar Suman Carrillo at Panama University.&lt;ref name=aniversario/&gt;

{{Education in the U.S.}}
'''Title&amp;nbsp;IX''' is a federal civil rights law in the United States of America that was passed as part of the [[Education Amendments of 1972]]. This is Public Law No. 92‑318, 86 Stat. 235 (June 23, 1972), codified at 20 U.S.C. §§ 1681–1688. It was co-authored and introduced by Senator [[Birch Bayh]] in the U.S. Senate, and Congresswoman [[Patsy_Mink|Patsy Mink]] in the House. It was later renamed the '''Patsy T. Mink Equal Opportunity in Education Act''' following Mink's death in 2002. The following is the original text as written and signed into law by President Richard Nixon in 1972:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/20/1681|title=20 U.S. Code § 1681 - Sex|website=LII / Legal Information Institute|language=en|access-date=2017-10-20|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171018225857/https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/20/1681|archivedate=2017-10-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical background==

===Foundations and hearings===
Title IX was enacted as a follow-up to passage of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]]. The 1964 Act was passed to end discrimination in various fields based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin in the areas of employment and public accommodation.&lt;ref&gt;Section 703(a)(1), Civil Rights Act of 1964, Pub. L. No. 88-352, 78 Stat. 241, 255 (July 2, 1964).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.archives.gov/education/lessons/civil-rights-act|title=The Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission|date=2016-08-15|work=National Archives|access-date=2017-10-20|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171020043707/https://www.archives.gov/education/lessons/civil-rights-act|archivedate=2017-10-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1964 Act did not prohibit sex discrimination against persons employed at educational institutions. A parallel law, Title VI, had also been enacted in 1964 to prohibit discrimination in federally funded private and public entities. It covered race, color, and national origin but excluded sex. Feminists during the early 1970s lobbied Congress to add sex as a protected class category. Title IX was enacted to fill this gap and prohibit discrimination in all federally funded education programs. Congressman John Tower then proposed an amendment to Title IX that would have exempted athletics departments from the scope of Title IX's coverage. 

The Tower amendment was rejected, but it led to widespread misunderstanding of Title IX as a sports-equity law, rather than an anti-discrimination, civil rights law.&lt;ref name="Suggs"&gt;Suggs, Welsh. ''A Place on the Team.'' Princeton, NJ.: Princeton University Press, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; While Title&amp;nbsp;IX is best known for its impact on high school and [[college athletics|collegiate athletics]], the original statute made no explicit mention of sports. The United States Supreme Court also issued decisions in the 1980s and 1990s, making clear that sexual harassment and assault is a form of sex discrimination. In 2011, President Barack Obama issued guidance reminding schools of their obligation to redress sexual assaults as civil rights matters under Title IX. Obama also issued guidance clarifying Title IX protections for LGBT students through [[Dear colleague letter (United States)|Dear Colleague]] letters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/letters/colleague-201010.pdf|title=Dear Colleague Letter on Harassment and Bullying|last=Office for Civil Rights|first=U.S. Department of Education|date=October 26, 2010|website=U.S. Department of Education|access-date=October 6, 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/letters/colleague-201605-title-ix-transgender.pdf|title=Dear Colleague Letter on Transgender Students|last=Office for Civil Rights|first=U.S. Department of Education|date=May 13, 2016|website=U.S. Department of Education|access-date=October 20, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171017204448/https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/letters/colleague-201605-title-ix-transgender.pdf|archivedate=October 17, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4067437-Sessions-memo-reversing-gender-identity-civil.html|title=Sessions memo reversing gender identity civil rights policy|last=Times)|first=Charles Savage (The New York|website=www.documentcloud.org|language=en|access-date=2017-10-20|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171020033440/https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4067437-Sessions-memo-reversing-gender-identity-civil.html|archivedate=2017-10-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/05/us/politics/transgender-civil-rights-act-justice-department-sessions.html|title=In Shift, Justice Dept.

The precursor to Title IX was an executive order, issued in 1967 by President [[Lyndon Johnson]], forbidding discrimination in federal contracts. Before these orders were issued, the [[National Organization for Women]] (NOW) had persuaded him through successful lobbying, or influencing, his personal aides or Members of Congress to include the addition of women.&lt;ref name="Suggs" /&gt; [[Executive Order 11375]] required all entities receiving federal contracts to end discrimination on the basis of sex in hiring and employment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=60553|title=Lyndon B.

August 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; She utilized university statistics to show how female employment at the University had plummeted as qualified women were replaced by men.&lt;ref name="Suggs" /&gt; Sandler then brought her complaints to the [[United States Department of Labor|Department of Labor]]'s [[Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs|Office for Federal Fair Contracts Compliance]], where she was encouraged to file a formal complaint; later citing inequalities in pay, rank, and admissions, among others. 

Sandler soon began to file complaints against the University of Maryland and against other colleges while working with NOW and the [[Women's Equity Action League]] (WEAL). Sandler later filed two hundred and sixty-nine (269) complaints against colleges and universities, which led to the events of 1970.&lt;ref name="Suggs" /&gt; In 1970, Sandler joined U.S. House Representative [[Edith Green]]'s [[United States House Education Subcommittee on Higher Education and Workforce Training|Subcommittee on Higher Education]] of the [[United States House Committee on Education and the Workforce|Education and Labor Committee]], and observed corresponding congressional hearings relating to women's issues on employment and equal opportunity. In these hearings, Green and Sandler initially proposed the idea of Title&amp;nbsp;IX. An early legislative draft was then authored by Representative [[Patsy Mink]] with the assistance of Representative [[Edith Green]].&lt;ref name="aauw"&gt;[http://www.aauw.org/advocacy/laf/lafnetwork/library/AthleticsHistory.cfm "Title&amp;nbsp;IX: A Brief History."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100415133530/http://www.aauw.org/advocacy/laf/lafnetwork/library/AthleticsHistory.cfm |date=2010-04-15 }} AAUW. 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  At the hearing, there were mentions of athletics. The idea behind the draft was a progressive one in somewhat instituting an affirmative action for women in all aspects of American education.&lt;ref name="Suggs" /&gt;

===Steps from a draft to legislative act to public law===
[[File:Birch bayh.jpg|thumb|Senator [[Birch Bayh]] of Indiana]]
Mink's initial draft of Title IX was formally introduced in Congress by Senator [[Birch Bayh]] of Indiana in 1971 who then was its chief Senate sponsor with respect to congressional debate. At the time, Bayh was working on numerous constitutional issues related to women's employment and sex discrimination—including but not limited to the revised draft of the [[Equal Rights Amendment]]. The ERA attempted to build "a powerful constitutional base from which to move forward in abolishing discriminatory differential treatment based on sex".&lt;ref name="Bayh"&gt;Cruikshank, Kate. ''[http://www.libraries.iub.edu/index.php?pageId=8621 The Art of Leadership; A Companion to an Exhibition from the Senatorial Papers of Birch Bayh] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121228194809/http://www.libraries.iub.edu/index.php?pageId=8621 |date=2012-12-28 }}''. (Indiana University Libraries, 2007), p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; As he was having partisan difficulty in later getting the ERA Amendment out of committee, the [[Higher Education Act of 1965]] was on the Senate Floor for re-authorization; and on 28 February 1972, Bayh re-introduced a provision found in the original/revised ERA bill as an amendment which would become Title IX.&lt;ref name="SenateIntro"&gt;118 Cong. Record 5802-3 (1972).&lt;/ref&gt; In his remarks on the Senate Floor, Bayh stated, "we are all familiar with the stereotype [that] women [are] pretty things who go to college to find a husband, [and who] go on to [[graduate school]] because they want a more interesting husband, and finally marry, have children, and never work again. 

The desire of many schools not to waste a 'man's place' on a woman stems from such stereotyped notions. But the facts absolutely contradict these myths about the 'weaker sex' and it is time to change our operating assumptions."&lt;ref name="SenateSpeech"&gt;118 Cong. Record 5804 (1972).&lt;/ref&gt; He continued: "While the impact of this amendment would be far-reaching, it is not a panacea. It is, however, an important first step in the effort to provide for the women of America something that is rightfully theirs—an equal chance to attend the schools of their choice, to develop the skills they want, and to apply those skills with the knowledge that they will have a fair chance to secure the jobs of their choice with equal pay for equal work".&lt;ref name="SenateSpeech2"&gt;118 Cong. Record 5808 (1972).&lt;/ref&gt; Title&amp;nbsp;IX became public law on 23 June 1972.&lt;ref name="now"&gt;[http://www.now.org/issues/title_ix/history.html "Legislative History of Title&amp;nbsp;IX"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100624070911/http://www.now.org/issues/title_ix/history.html |date=2010-06-24 }} National Organization for Women.

===Implementation===
[[File:BirchWorkout.jpg|thumb|Senator Bayh exercises with female athletes at Purdue University, ca. 1970s.]]Title IX's statutory language is brief. U.S. President Nixon therefore directed the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|Department of Health, Education and Welfare]] (HEW) to carry publish regulations clarifying the law's application.&lt;ref name="Suggs"/&gt; In 1974, U.S. Senator [[John Tower]] introduced the Tower Amendment which would have exempted revenue-producing sports from Title&amp;nbsp;IX compliance.&lt;ref name="cases"&gt;[http://bailiwick.lib.uiowa.edu/ge/historyRE.html "Landmark Title&amp;nbsp;IX Cases in History"] {{webarchive|url=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20110914080142/http://bailiwick.lib.uiowa.edu/ge/historyRE.html |date=2011-09-14 }} Gender Equity in Sport. February 23, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, Congress rejected the Tower Amendment and passed an amendment proposed by U.S. Senator [[Jacob Javits]] directly HEW to include "reasonable provisions considering the nature of particular sports" adopted in its place.&lt;ref name="Suggs" /&gt; In June 1975, HEW published the final regulations detailing how Title&amp;nbsp;IX would be enforced.&lt;ref name="Suggs" /&gt;  These regulations were codified in the [[Federal Register]] in the [[Code of Federal Regulations]] Volume 34, Part 106 ([https://www2.ed.gov/policy/rights/reg/ocr/edlite-34cfr106.html {{USCFR|34|106}}] [[Title 34 of the Code of Federal Regulations|34 C.F.R.]] [https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/34/106 106] [[Title 34 of the Code of Federal Regulations|34 C.F.R.]] [https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/34/106 106]).

===Further legislation===
[[File:Patsymink.jpg|thumb|Representative [[Patsy Mink]] of Hawaii, Title IX co-author, for whom the law was renamed in 2002]]
The Civil Rights Restoration Act of 1988 is tied to Title IX which was passed in response to the U.S. Supreme Court's 1984 ruling ''[[Grove City College v. Bell]].''&lt;ref name="oyez"&gt;[http://oyez.org/cases/1980-1989/1983/1983_82_792 "The Oyez Project, Grove City College v.

Encyclopædia Britannica Online. 19 Nov. 2009&lt;/ref&gt; This case was initially reached by the Supreme Court when [[Grove City College]] disagreed with the Department of Education's assertion that it was required to comply with Title&amp;nbsp;IX. Grove City College was not a federally funded institution; however, they did accept students who were receiving [[Basic Educational Opportunity Grant]]s through a Department of Education program.&lt;ref name="oyez"/&gt; The Department of Education's stance was that because some of its students were receiving federal grants, the school was thus receiving federal assistance and Title&amp;nbsp;IX applied to it. The Court decided that since Grove City College was only receiving federal funding through the grant program that only this program had to be in compliance. This ruling was a major victory for those opposed to Title&amp;nbsp;IX as it then made many athletic programs outside the purview of Title&amp;nbsp;IX, and thus reduced its scope.&lt;ref name="Suggs"/&gt;  

Grove City's victory, however, was short-lived. The Civil Rights Restoration Act successfully passed in 1988, which extended Title&amp;nbsp;IX coverage to all programs of any educational institution that receives ''any'' federal assistance, both direct and indirect.&lt;ref name="now" /&gt; In 1994, the Equity in Athletics Disclosure Act, sponsored by Congresswoman [[Cardiss Collins]] required that federally-assisted educational institutions disclose information on roster sizes for men's and women's athletic teams; as well as budgets for recruiting, scholarships, coaches' salaries, and other expenses, annually.&lt;ref name="cases" /&gt; In October 2002, less than a month after the death of U.S. Rep. Patsy Mink, the U.S. Congress passed a resolution to rename Title IX the "Patsy Takemoto Mink Equal Opportunity in Education Act," which President George W. Bush signed into law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bush signs resolution honoring Patsy Mink|url=http://the.honoluluadvertiser.com/article/2002/Oct/31/ln/ln41a.html|accessdate=20 May 2013|newspaper=Honolulu Advertiser|date=31 October 2002|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131018064617/http://the.honoluluadvertiser.com/article/2002/Oct/31/ln/ln41a.html|archivedate=18 October 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 24, 2006, Title&amp;nbsp;IX regulations were amended to provide greater flexibility in the operation of single-sex classes or extracurricular activities at the primary or secondary school level; this was largely to introduce federal abstinence-only programs, which may have been a partial basis for the support of President Bush.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.ed.gov/legislation/FedRegister/finrule/2006-4/102506a.html |title=Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Sex in Education Programs or Activities Receiving Federal Financial Assistance |journal=Federal Register |volume=71 |number=206 |date=October 25, 2006 |accessdate=2012-06-24 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120620084108/http://www2.ed.gov/legislation/FedRegister/finrule/2006-4/102506a.html |archivedate=June 20, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Impact on American Schools ==

=== Equity in athletics ===
Though views differ as respects the impact of Title&amp;nbsp;IX, discussion typically focuses on whether or not Title&amp;nbsp;IX has resulted in increased athletic opportunities for females, and whether and to what extent Title&amp;nbsp;IX has resulted in decreased athletic opportunities for males.{{By whom|date=July 2017}} In addition, the legislation had impacts on aspects other than athletes. The increased exposure of female sports led to increased dominance by males of the governance of female athletics. For example, the male-dominated NCAA, which had been content to let the female-dominated AIAW run female championships, decided to offer female championships, leading to the eventual demise of the AIAW.&lt;ref name="Hult 240"&gt;{{harvnb|Hult |p=240}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Advocates of Title&amp;nbsp;IX's current interpretation cite increases in female athletic participation, and attribute those increases to Title&amp;nbsp;IX.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Title&amp;nbsp;IX Athletic Statistics |publisher=[[American Association of University Women]] |url=http://www.aauw.org/advocacy/laf/lafnetwork/library/athleticStatistics.cfm |accessdate=2009-10-13 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091016045122/http://www.aauw.org/advocacy/laf/lafnetwork/library/athleticStatistics.cfm |archivedate=2009-10-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ncwge.org/PDF/TitleIXat35.pdf |title=Title&amp;nbsp;IX at 35: Beyond the Headlines |publisher=National Coalition of Women and Girls in Education |accessdate=2009-10-13 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090919181353/http://www.ncwge.org/PDF/TitleIXat35.pdf |archivedate=2009-09-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.titleix.info/ |title=TitleIX.info |accessdate=2009-10-13 |publisher=The MARGARET Fund of NWLC |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090621091142/http://www.titleix.info/ |archivedate=2009-06-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; One study, completed in 2006, pointed to a large increase in the number of women participating in athletics at both the high school and college level. The number of women in high school sports had increased by a factor of nine, while the number of women in college sports had increased by more than 450%.&lt;ref&gt;Linda Jean Carpenter and R. Vivian Acosta, ''Women in Intercollegiate Sport: A Longitudinal National Study Twenty-Nine Year Update 1977-2006'' (2006)).&lt;/ref&gt; A 2008 study of intercollegiate athletics showed that women's collegiate sports have grown to 9,101 teams, or 8.65 per school. The five most frequently offered college sports for women are, in order: (1) Basketball, 98.8% of schools have a team; (2) Volleyball, 95.7%; (3) Soccer, 92.0%; (4) Cross Country; 90.8%, and (5) Softball; 89.2%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://webpages.charter.net/womeninsport/2008%20Summary%20Final.pdf |title=Women in Intercollegiate Sport, a Longitudinal National Study |year=2008 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704090411/http://webpages.charter.net/womeninsport/2008%20Summary%20Final.pdf |archivedate=2008-07-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time, many contend that the current interpretation of Title&amp;nbsp;IX by the OCR has resulted in the dismantling of men's programs, despite strong participation in those sports.&lt;ref name="Shelton 2001"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Equally Bad is Not Good: Allowing Title&amp;nbsp;IX "Compliance" by the Elimination of Men's Collegiate Sports  |work=University of Michigan Journal of Law Reform |first=Donald E. |last=Shelton |year=2001 |volume=34 |number=1 |ssrn=1163230}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, though interest in the sport of wrestling has consistently increased at the high school level since 1990,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=USA Wrestling response to quotes by Donna Lopiano - Women's Sports Found. |year=2000 |url=http://www.themat.com/section.php?section_id=3&amp;page=showarticle&amp;ArticleID=2523 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120710041414/http://themat.com/section.php?section_id=3&amp;page=showarticle&amp;ArticleID=2523 |archivedate=2012-07-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; scores of colleges have dropped their wrestling programs during that same period.&lt;ref name="collegesportsscholarships.com"&gt;{{cite news |title=Title&amp;nbsp;IX has hurt the college sport, but it is now fighting back. |year=2003 |url=http://www.collegesportsscholarships.com/title-ix-fall-college-wrestling.htm |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100113131238/http://www.collegesportsscholarships.com/title-ix-fall-college-wrestling.htm |archivedate=2010-01-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="collegian.psu.edu"&gt;{{cite news|title=Wrestling programs threatened by Title&amp;nbsp;IX. |year=1997 |url=http://www.collegian.psu.edu/archive/1997/03/03-28-97tdc/03-28-97d03-017.htm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030105092313/http://www.collegian.psu.edu/archive/1997/03/03-28-97tdc/03-28-97d03-017.htm |archivedate=2003-01-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The OCR's three-prong test for compliance with Title&amp;nbsp;IX often is cited as the reason for these cuts.&lt;ref name="collegian.psu.edu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="usatoday.com"&gt;{{cite news |title=Bucknell to drop wrestling for Title&amp;nbsp;IX compliance. |year=2001 |url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/college/2001-05-02-bucknell-title9.htm.htm }} {{Dead link|date=September 2011|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wrestling historically was the most frequently dropped sport,&lt;ref name="usatoday.com"/&gt; but other men's sports later overtook the lead, such that according to the NCAA, the most-dropped men's sports between 1987 and 2002 were as follows:  Cross country (183), indoor track (180), golf (178), tennis (171), rowing (132), outdoor track (126), swimming (125) and wrestling (121).&lt;ref name="collegesportsscholarships.com"/&gt;

Some believe that the increase in athletic opportunity for girls in high school has come at the expense of boys' athletics. For example, the College Sports Council has stated, "Nationwide, there are currently 1.3&amp;nbsp;million more boys participating in high school sports than girls. Using a [[gender]] quota to enforce Title&amp;nbsp;IX in high school sports would put those young athletes at risk of losing their opportunity to play."&lt;ref name="McErlain"&gt;McErlain, Eric. [http://collegesportscouncil.org "College Sports Council Urges High Schools to Fight Use of Gender Quotas to Comply with Title&amp;nbsp;IX in Athletics."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160528101714/http://www.collegesportscouncil.org/ |date=2016-05-28 }}, College Sports Council, 8 Feb 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; High school participation rates from the [[National Federation of State High School Associations|National Federation of High School associations]] report that in 2010–11, there were 4,494,406 boys and 3,173,549 girls participating in high school athletics.&lt;ref name="NFHS"&gt;NFHS [http://www.nfhs.org/content.aspx?id=5752 "High School Sports Participation Continues Upward Climb."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120815140834/http://www.nfhs.org/content.aspx?id=5752 |date=2012-08-15 }}, National Federation of High School Associations, Aug. 24, 2011,&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been different interpretations regarding Title&amp;nbsp;IX's application to high school athletics.  The American Sports Council sued the Department of Education in 2011 seeking a declaratory judgment that its policy interpreting Title&amp;nbsp;IX's requirement for equity in participation opportunities is limited to colleges and universities.&lt;ref name="Frommer"&gt;Frederick J. Frommer. [http://abcnews.go.com/Sports/wireStory?id=14125030 "Group Sues Over Title&amp;nbsp;IX High School Enforcement."] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130124071600/http://abcnews.go.com/Sports/wireStory?id=14125030 |date=2013-01-24 }}, Associated Press, 21 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The American Sports Council argued that "The three-part test and its encouragement of quotas, has no relevance to high schools or high-school sports, and no federal regulation or interpretation has ever said that high schools must abide by the three-part test".&lt;ref name="McErlain" /&gt; On the other hand, the Department of Education insists that Title&amp;nbsp;IX is a "valuable tool" for ensuring a level playing field for all students" and "plays a critical role in ensuring a fundamental level of fairness in America's schools and universities".&lt;ref name="Frommer" /&gt;

Between 1981 and 1999 university athletic departments cut 171 men's [[wrestling]] teams, 84 men's [[tennis]] teams, 56 men's [[gymnastics]] teams, 27 men's [[track and field|track]] teams, and 25 men's [[swimming (sport)|swimming]] teams.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Alison.

Because teams vary widely in size, it is more appropriate to compare the number of total participation opportunities. Additionally, the total number of college participation opportunities has increased for both sexes in the Title&amp;nbsp;IX era, though solely for women when increased enrollment is accounted for, as men's participation remained static relative to university enrollment, and men's opportunities outnumber women's by a wide margin.&lt;ref name="GAO"&gt;GAO&lt;/ref&gt;

The Women's Sports Foundation reported in a 2007 study of athletic opportunities at NCAA institutions that over 150,000 female athletic opportunities would need to be added in order to reach participation levels proportional to the female undergraduate population.&lt;ref&gt;Cheslock, John.

===Sexual harassment and sexual violence===
Title IX applies to all educational programs and all aspects of a school's educational system. In the 1990s, the U.S. Supreme Court issued three decisions clarifying that Title IX requires schools to respond appropriately to reports of sexual harassment and sexual violence against students.  Civil rights activists and organizations such as the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU) likewise maintain that "when students suffer sexual assault and harassment, they are deprived of equal and free access to an education."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.aclu.org/womens-rights/title-ix-and-sexual-violence-schools |title=Title IX and Sexual Violence in Schools |publisher=American Civil Liberties Union |accessdate=2013-05-04 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502072043/http://www.aclu.org/womens-rights/title-ix-and-sexual-violence-schools |archivedate=2013-05-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Further, according to an April 2011 letter issued by the [[Department of Education]]'s [[Office for Civil Rights]], "The sexual harassment of students, including sexual violence, interferes with students' right to receive an education free from discrimination and, in the case of sexual violence, is a crime."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/letters/colleague-201104.html |title=Dear Colleague letter |publisher=Office of the Assistant Secretary, the Department of Education |accessdate=2013-05-04 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130509212653/http://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/letters/colleague-201104.html |archivedate=2013-05-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The letter, named the Dear Colleague Letter, states that it is the responsibility of institutions of higher education "to take immediate and effective steps to end sexual harassment and sexual violence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/letters/colleague-201104_pg2.html |title=Dear Colleague letter |publisher=Office of the Assistant Secretary, the Department of Education |accessdate=2013-05-04 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130423205929/http://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/letters/colleague-201104_pg2.html |archivedate=2013-04-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The letter illustrates multiple examples of Title IX requirements as they relate to sexual violence, and makes clear that, should an institution fail to fulfill its responsibilities under Title IX, the [[Department of Education]] can impose a fine and potentially deny further institutional access to federal funds.

On March 15, 2011, [[Yale]] undergraduate student and alleged sexual violence survivor Alexandra Brodsky filed a Title IX complaint along with fifteen fellow students alleging Yale "has a sexually hostile environment and has failed to adequately respond to sexual harassment concerns."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=John Christofferson |title=Yale Under Federal Investigation For 'Sexually Hostile Environment' |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/04/01/yale-title-ix_n_843570.html |work=The Huffington Post |date=2011-04-01 |accessdate=2013-05-04 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130825191009/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/04/01/yale-title-ix_n_843570.html |archivedate=2013-08-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2012, an [[Amherst College]] student, [[Angie Epifano]], wrote an explicit, personal account of her alleged sexual assault and the ensuing "appalling treatment" she received when coming forward to seek support from the College's administration.&lt;ref name="Epifano"&gt;{{cite news|last=Epifano|first=Angie|title=An Account of Sexual Assault at Amherst College|url=http://amherststudent.amherst.edu/?q=article/2012/10/17/account-sexual-assault-amherst-college|accessdate=June 23, 2013|newspaper=The Amherst Student|date=2012-10-17|deadurl=no|archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20121019215229/http://amherststudent.amherst.edu/?q=article%2F2012%2F10%2F17%2Faccount-sexual-assault-amherst-college|archivedate=October 19, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the narrative, Epifano alleged that she was raped by a fellow Amherst student and described how her life was affected by the experience; she stated that the perpetrator harassed her at the only dining hall, that her academic performance was negatively affected, and that, when she sought support, the administration coerced her into taking the blame for her experience and ultimately institutionalized her and pressured her to drop out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Richard|first=Perez-Pena|title=Student's Account Has Rape in Spotlight|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/27/education/amherst-account-of-rape-brings-tension-to-forefront.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0|accessdate=24 June 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=October 26, 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130104144332/http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/27/education/amherst-account-of-rape-brings-tension-to-forefront.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0|archivedate=4 January 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The fact that such a prestigious institution could have such a noxious interior fills me with intense remorse mixed with sour distaste. I am sickened by the Administration's attempts to cover up survivors' stories, cook their books to discount rapes, pretend that withdrawals never occur, quell attempts at change, and sweep sexual assaults under a rug. When politicians cover up affairs or scandals the masses often rise up in angry protestations and call for a more transparent government. What is the difference between a government and the Amherst College campus? Why can't we know what is really happening on campus? Why should we be quiet about sexual assault?"&lt;ref name="Epifano"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

When the Amherst case reached national attention, [[Annie E. Clark]] and [[Andrea Pino]], two women who were allegedly sexually assaulted at the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]] connected with Amherst student, [[Dana Bolger]], and Brodsky to address the parallel concerns of hostility at their institution, filing Title IX and [[Clery Act]] complaints against the university on January 2013, both leading to investigations by the [[U.S. Department of Education]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Perez-Pena|first=Richard|title=Students Initiate Inquiry Into Harassment Reports|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/08/education/students-initiate-inquiry-into-harassment-reports.html?hpw|accessdate=24 June 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=March 7, 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130527115019/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/08/education/students-initiate-inquiry-into-harassment-reports.html?hpw|archivedate=27 May 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the national prominence of the UNC Chapel Hill case, organizers Pino and Clark went on to coordinate with students at other schools; in 2013, complaints citing violations of Title IX were filed by [[Occidental College]] (on April 18), [[Swarthmore College]] and [[the University of Southern California]] (on May 22).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Tyler Kingkade |title=College Sexual Assault Survivors Form Underground Network To Reform Campus Policies |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/03/21/college-sexual-assault-survivors_n_2918855.html |publisher=The Huffington Post |date=2013-03-21 |accessdate=2013-05-04 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130508182458/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/03/21/college-sexual-assault-survivors_n_2918855.html |archivedate=2013-05-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Castellanos"&gt;{{cite news |author=Dalina Castellanos |title=Complaints filed against USC, UC Berkeley over rape reporting |url=http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-0523-college-rape-20130523,0,106833.story |date=2010-05-22 |accessdate=2013-05-23 |work=Los Angeles Times |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130523150800/http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-0523-college-rape-20130523,0,106833.story |archivedate=2013-05-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; These complaints, the resulting campaigns against sexual violence on college campuses, and the organizing of Bolger, Brodsky, Clark, Pino and other activists led to the formation of an informal national network of activists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Perez-Pena|first=Richard|title=College Groups Connect to Fight Sexual Assault|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/20/education/activists-at-colleges-network-to-fight-sexual-assault.html?pagewanted=all|accessdate=24 June 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=March 19, 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130524233543/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/20/education/activists-at-colleges-network-to-fight-sexual-assault.html?pagewanted=all|archivedate=24 May 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Stancill |first=Jane |title=UNC-CH women wage national campaign against sexual assault |url=http://www.newsobserver.com/2013/06/01/2932161/unc-ch-women-wage-national-campaign.html |accessdate=24 June 2013 |newspaper=The News &amp; Observer |date=1 June 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130609020944/http://www.newsobserver.com/2013/06/01/2932161/unc-ch-women-wage-national-campaign.html |archivedate=9 June 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bolger and Brodsky also started [[Know Your IX]], an organization of student activists focused on legal education and federal and state policy change.

In addition to its use within formal complaints submitted to the [[Department of Education]], Title IX has been utilized in civil litigation. In 2006, a federal court found that there was sufficient evidence that the [[University of Colorado]] acted with "deliberate indifference" toward students Lisa Simpson and Anne Gilmore, who were sexually assaulted by student football players. The university settled the case, promising to change its policies and pay $2.5 million in damages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.aclu.org/racial-justice-womens-rights/simpson-v-university-colorado |title=Simpson v.

Despite its claim that it bore no responsibility, the school settled the lawsuit, agreeing to revise and improve its official response to sexual misconduct and to pay the plaintiff $850,000 in damages and fees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.aclu.org/womens-rights/jk-v-arizona-board-regents |title=J.K. v.

The Trump administration has made changes to guidelines that were implemented during the Obama administration. These changes shift the determination of sexual assault from "preponderance of the evidence" to a "clear and convincing" evidence standard, which is typically used for civil cases in which serious allegations are made (as opposed to the standard of beyond reasonable doubt in criminal cases).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2018/06/20/how-have-obamas-k-12-policies-fared-under.html|title=How Have Obama's K-12 Policies Fared Under Trump?|last=Ujifusa|first=Andrew|work=Education Week|access-date=2018-06-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 22, 2017, US Secretary of Education Secretary Betsy Devos rescinded the Obama-era guidelines which had prodded colleges and universities to more aggressively investigate campus sexual assaults.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.latimes.com/politics/washington/la-na-essential-washington-updates-secretary-of-education-betsy-devos-1506092354-htmlstory.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transgender students===
{{main|Gender identity under Title IX}}
Between 2010 and 2016, under the [[Obama administration]] the U.S. Department of Education issued guidance explaining that [[transgender]] students are protected from sex-based discrimination under Title IX. It instructed public schools to treat transgender students consistent with their gender identity in academic life. A student who identifies as a transgender boy, for instance, is allowed entry to a boys-only class, and a student who identifies as a transgender girl is allowed entry to a girls-only class. This also applies to academic records if that student is over the age of eighteen at a university.&lt;ref name="Dominic Holden"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/dominicholden/department-of-education-issues-guidelines-to-protect-transge?s=mobile|title=Department Of Education Issues Guidelines To Protect Transgender Students In Single-Sex Classrooms|author=Dominic Holden|work=BuzzFeed|accessdate=2 December 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171121033755/https://www.buzzfeed.com/dominicholden/department-of-education-issues-guidelines-to-protect-transge?s=mobile|archivedate=21 November 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The memo states in part that "[a]ll students, including transgender students, or students who do not conform to sex stereotypes, are protected from sex-based discrimination under Title IX. Under Title IX, a recipient generally must treat transgender, or gender non-conforming, consistent with their gender identity in all aspects of the planning, implementation, enrollment, operation, and evaluation of single-sex classes."&lt;ref name="Dominic Holden"/&gt;

However, starting in 2017 with the [[Trump administration]], several of these policies have been rolled back. In February 2017, the Departments of Justice and Education withdrew the guidance on gender identity.&lt;ref name="guardian-23feb2017"&gt;{{cite news|author1=David Smith|author2=Molly Redden|title=Trump administration rescinds Obama-era protections for transgender students|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/feb/22/transgender-students-bathroom-trump-obama|accessdate=February 23, 2017|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=February 23, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170222220432/https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/feb/22/transgender-students-bathroom-trump-obama|archivedate=February 22, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Education Department headed by [[Betsy DeVos]] announced on 12 February 2018 that Title IX did not allow transgender students to use the bathroom of their gender identities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/education/wp/2018/02/12/education-department-will-no-longer-investigate-transgender-bathroom-complaints/|title=Education Department no longer investigating transgender bathroom complaints|first=Moriah|last=Balingit|date=12 February 2018|publisher=|accessdate=27 April 2018|via=www.washingtonpost.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180322084639/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/education/wp/2018/02/12/education-department-will-no-longer-investigate-transgender-bathroom-complaints/|archivedate=22 March 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2018, ''[[The New York Times]]'' obtained a memo issued by the Department of Health and Human Services that would propose a strict definition of gender for Title IX, using the person's sex as determined at birth and could not be changed, effectively limiting recognition of transgender students and potentially others. The memo stated that the government needed to define gender "on a biological basis that is clear, grounded in science, objective and administrable".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/21/us/politics/transgender-trump-administration-sex-definition.html?module=inline | title =‘Transgender’ Could Be Defined Out of Existence Under Trump Administration | first1 = Erica | last1= Green | first2=  Katie | last2=  Benner | first3 =  Robert | last3 = Pear | date = October 21, 2018 | accessdate = October 22, 2018 | work = [[The New York Times]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The news brought immediate protests in several locations as well as online social media under the "#WontBeErased" hashtag.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/22/us/transgender-reaction-rally.html | title = #WontBeErased: Transgender People and Allies Mobilize Against Trump Administration Proposal | first = Sarah | last = Mervosh | date = October 22, 2018 | accessdate = October 22, 2018 | work = [[The New York Times]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==OCR's test for Title IX compliance==
{{main|Office for Civil Rights}}
Title&amp;nbsp;IX has been a source of controversy in part due to claims that the OCR's current interpretation of Title&amp;nbsp;IX, and specifically its three-prong test of compliance, is no longer faithful to the anti-discrimination language in Title&amp;nbsp;IX's text, and instead discriminates against men and has contributed to the reduction of programs for male athletes.&lt;ref name="Shelton 2001"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Irving 2003"&gt;{{cite news |title=Wrestling With Title&amp;nbsp;IX |work=New York Times |first=John |last=Irving |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/01/28/opinion/28IRVI.html?pagewanted=3 |date=2003-01-28 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160311175231/http://www.nytimes.com/2003/01/28/opinion/28IRVI.html?pagewanted=3 |archivedate=2016-03-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gavora 2003"&gt;{{cite news |title=Tilting the Playing Field:  Schools, Sports, Sex and Title&amp;nbsp;IX |first=Jessica |last=Gavora |year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics of the three-prong test contend that it operates as a "quota" in that it places undue emphasis on the first prong (known as the "proportionality" prong), which fails to take into account any differences in the genders' respective levels of interest in participating in athletics (in spite of the third prong, which focuses on any differences in the genders' respective levels of interest in participation). Instead it requires that the genders' athletic participation be substantially proportionate to their enrollment, without regard to interest.  Prong two is viewed as only a temporary fix for universities, as universities may only point to past expansion of opportunities for female students for a limited time before compliance with another prong is necessary. Critics say that prong three likewise fails to consider male athletic interest in spite of its gender-neutral language, as it requires that the university fully and effectively accommodate the athletic interests of the "underrepresented sex", despite the fact that ED regulations expressly require that the OCR consider whether the institution "effectively accommodate[s] the interests and abilities of members of both sexes". As such, with a focus on increasing female athletic opportunities without any counterbalance to take male athletic interest into consideration, critics maintain that the OCR's three-prong test actually operates to discriminate against men.&lt;ref name="Shelton 2001"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gavora 2003"/&gt;

Defenders of the three-prong test counter that the genders' differing athletic interest levels are merely a product of past discrimination, and that Title&amp;nbsp;IX should be interpreted to maximize female participation in athletics regardless of any existing disparity in interest. Thus while defenders argue that the three-prong test embodies the maxim that "opportunity drives interest",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Smith professor speaks on Title&amp;nbsp;IX |work=The Smith College Sophian |year=2008 |url=http://media.www.smithsophian.com/media/storage/paper587/news/2008/12/04/Sports/Smith.Professor.Speaks.On.Title.Ix-3567623.shtml |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081207111650/http://media.www.smithsophian.com/media/storage/paper587/news/2008/12/04/Sports/Smith.Professor.Speaks.On.Title.Ix-3567623.shtml |archivedate=2008-12-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; critics argue that the three-prong test goes beyond Title&amp;nbsp;IX original purpose of preventing discrimination, and instead amounts to an exercise in which athletic opportunities are taken away from male students and given to female students, despite the comparatively lower interest levels of those female students. Author and self-described women's rights advocate [[John Irving]] opined in a ''[[New York Times]]'' column that on this topic, women's advocates were being "purely vindictive" in insisting that the current OCR interpretation of Title&amp;nbsp;IX be maintained.&lt;ref name="Irving 2003"/&gt;

On March 17, 2005, OCR announced a clarification of prong three of the three-part test of Title&amp;nbsp;IX compliance. The guidance concerned the use of web-based surveys to determine the level of interest in varsity athletics among the underrepresented sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Additional Clarification of Intercollegiate Athletics Policy: Three-Part Test – Part Three |url=http://www.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/title9guidanceadditional.html |publisher=[[U.S. Department of Education]] |accessdate=2009-10-13 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091018094908/http://www.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/title9guidanceadditional.html |archivedate=2009-10-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Opponents of the clarification – including the NCAA Executive Committee, which issued a resolution soon afterward asking Association members not to use the survey – claimed the survey was flawed in part because of the way it counted non-responses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=OCR rescinds 2005 Title&amp;nbsp;IX clarification |url=https://www.ncaa.org/wps/portal/ncaahome?WCM_GLOBAL_CONTEXT=/ncaa/ncaa/ncaa+news/ncaa+news+online/2010/association-wide/ocr+rescinds+2005+title+ix+clarification_04_20_10_ncaa_news |publisher=[[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] |accessdate=2010-04-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110416001218/http://www.ncaa.org/wps/portal/ncaahome?WCM_GLOBAL_CONTEXT=%2Fncaa%2Fncaa%2Fncaa+news%2Fncaa+news+online%2F2010%2Fassociation-wide%2Focr+rescinds+2005+title+ix+clarification_04_20_10_ncaa_news |archivedate=2011-04-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 20, 2010, the U.S. Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights abandoned the 2005 clarification that allowed institutions to use only Internet or e‑mail surveys to meet the interests and abilities (third prong) option of the three-part test for Title&amp;nbsp;IX compliance.

In February 2010, the [[United States Commission on Civil Rights]] weighed in on the OCR's three-prong test, offering several recommendations on Title&amp;nbsp;IX policy to address what it termed "unnecessary reduction of men's athletic opportunities".&lt;ref name="USCCR 2010 report"&gt;{{cite web |title=Title IX Athletics: Accommodating Interests and Abilities |url=http://www.usccr.gov/pubs/TitleIX-2010.pdf |publisher=[[U.S. Commission on Civil Rights]] |accessdate=2010-02-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101214210606/http://www.usccr.gov/pubs/TitleIX-2010.pdf |archivedate=2010-12-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Brady 2010"&gt;{{cite news |title=Commission: Title&amp;nbsp;IX interpretation unnecessarily hurts men's sports |work=USA Today |first=Erik |last=Brady |url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/college/2010-04-01-title-ix_N.htm |date=2010-04-02 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305151642/http://www.usatoday.com/sports/college/2010-04-01-title-ix_N.htm |archivedate=2012-03-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Commission advocated use of surveys to measure interest, and specifically recommended that the Department of Education's regulations on interest and abilities be revised "to explicitly take into account the interest of both sexes rather than just the interest of the underrepresented sex", almost always females.&lt;ref name="Brady 2010"/&gt;

==Legacy and recognition==
On the twenty-fifth anniversary of Title IX the [[National Women's Law Center]] lodged twenty-five complaints with the [[U.S. Department of Education]]'s [[Office for Civil Rights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reason.com/archives/2001/04/01/title-ixs-pyrrhic-victory/|title=Title IX's Pyrrhic Victory|author=Michael W.

There were several events praising the 40th anniversary of Title&amp;nbsp;IX in June 2012.

The '''Campeonato Anual Regional del Oeste''', commonly known as the '''Torneo Cuyano''' or '''Torneo del Oeste''', is a regional [[rugby union]] competition in [[Argentina]]. The competition started in 2000 and involves 10 clubs from the unions of [[Unión de Rugby de Cuyo|Cuyo]] (Mendoza), San Luis and San Juan [[provinces of Argentina|provinces]].

This annual tournament has traditionally been dominated by ''Mendocino'' clubs. As in other inter-provincial tournaments, such as the [[Torneo del Litoral]] or [[Torneo del Noroeste]], the best placed clubs in the Torneo del Oeste qualify for the [[Torneo del Interior]].

In addition, UCLA announced on November 22, 2014 that the number 42 would be retired across all university sports in honor of [[Jackie Robinson]], a four-sport star at UCLA who went on to a [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|Hall of Fame]] career in [[Major League Baseball]] and broke that sport's [[Baseball color line|20th-century color line]]. While Robinson wore several different numbers while at the school from 1939 to 1941, the number 42 was chosen because it was the number he wore during his [[History of the Brooklyn Dodgers|Brooklyn Dodgers]] career. The all-sports retirement had no effect on men's basketball since that number had already been retired for Hazzard; however, Robinson's  42 will be prominently displayed within all UCLA athletic venues, including Pauley Pavilion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.uclabruins.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=30500&amp;ATCLID=209775149 |title=UCLA Honors Jackie Robinson by Retiring #42 Across All Sports |publisher=UCLA Athletics |date=November 22, 2014 |accessdate=November 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''United States Equestrian Federation''' ('''USEF or US Equestrian''') is the national [[Sport governing body|governing body]] for most [[Equestrianism|equestrian]] sports in the [[United States]].  It began on January 20, 1917, as the Association of American Horse Shows, later changed to the '''American Horse Shows Association''' (AHSA). In 2001, the organization changed its name to USA Equestrian (USAE) and, in 2003 it merged with the [[United States Equestrian Team]] (USET). In 2017, USEF rebranded as US Equestrian. 

Competitions governed by US Equestrian include [[dressage]], [[driving]], [[endurance riding]], [[eventing]], [[equitation|hunt seat equitation]], [[hunt seat|hunter]], [[show jumping|jumper]], para-equestrian, [[reining]], roadster, [[equitation|saddle seat equitation]], [[Equestrian vaulting|vaulting]], and [[western riding]] competition including [[equitation]], [[western pleasure]], [[reining]], [[trail (horse show)|trail]], [[western dressage]], and related events.

The organization also governs breed shows held in the United States for the [[Andalusian horse|Andalusian]], [[Lusitano]], [[Arabian (horse)|Arabian]], [[Part-Arabian|Half-Arabian]]/[[Anglo-Arabian]], [[Connemara pony|Connemara]], [[Friesian horse|Friesian]], [[Hackney horse|Hackney]], [[Morgan horse|Morgan]], [[American Saddlebred]], [[National Show Horse]], [[Paso Fino]], [[Shetland pony|Shetland]], and [[Welsh pony and cob|Welsh]] breeds.

US Equestrian keeps track of yearly points accumulated at individual horse shows throughout the year and gives awards based on these points at the end of the year.  Horse shows governed under the USEF are given an AA, A, B, or C rating.  Shows with an AA rating are the most prestigious and often offer the most prize money, whereas shows with a C rating are more local, usually awarding less prize money. Competitions recognized by the USEF must follow its rules and bylaws.

Governing bodies working under the USEF include: 
*[[United States Hunter/Jumper Association]] (USHJA)
*[[United States Dressage Federation]] (USDF)
*[[United States Eventing Association]] (USEA)

*President: Murray Kessler
*Secretary/Treasurer: Chester Weber

==History==
On January 20, 1917, representatives of some fifty horse shows met in [[Manhattan]] under the leadership of [[Vanderbilt family|Reginald C. Vanderbilt]]. Their intention was to unite in order to assure clean competition in the show ring.  They formed the '''Association of American Horse Shows''', which by its first annual meeting on January 29, 1918, included the organizers of 26 well-known horse shows.  The association incorporated in June 1918.  Membership grew to list 35 member shows in 1919, and 67 shows by 1924.  By the time of Vanderbilt's death in 1925, the organization had enrolled almost 70 shows as members of the organization.

Alfred B. Maclay was the next individual elected president. Early in his term, in 1927, the association printed its first set of rules, consisting of a six-page pamphlet. The rules were revised continually and have been added to throughout the history of the association. When Maclay's term ended in 1936, membership included 183 shows.

Maclay was followed by [[Pierre Lorillard Jr.|Pierre Lorillard]] as president. He served a year before Adrian Van Sinderen was elected. Under Van Sinderen, the office was relocated to 90 Broad Street in Manhattan. By the end of Van Sinderen's tenure in 1960, the rule book had grown to one hundred and sixty-eight pages.

The need for show stewards, representatives of the association to be present at and report on recognized shows, was recognized in the minutes of a 1930 executive committee meeting.  It was not until the 1948 rule book that stewards were written in, however, and not until the 1960 rule book that licensing of stewards was in place and recognized in the rules.

In February 1933 the original name, the Association of American Horse Shows, Inc., was changed to the '''American Horse Shows Association, Inc.'''  At the same meeting, individual members were recognized in addition to show members.

In 1935, a committee reported on their investigation of the transfer of control of the United States' membership in the [[Fédération Équestre Internationale|International Equestrian Federation]] (FEI) membership from the United States Cavalry Association to the AHSA.  The transfer of membership took place after the [[1936 Summer Olympics]], and after that, in the United States, the FEI rules applied only to international military classes.  By this time, AHSA membership had grown to include 183 members and shows.

By 1937, the new rule book reflected the growth of the association by dividing the United States into five zones, each with a vice president and a five-member regional committee.

In 1939, the association began publication of the monthly magazine, ''Horse Show'', with an initial circulation of 1,200 copies.  By this time there were 187 recognized shows, and 800 individual members.

In 1960, the association began sending licensed [[horse show steward|stewards]] to each affiliated show to report and verify that the show was following the association's rules.

In 1999, the association moved from its Manhattan office to the [[Kentucky Horse Park]] in [[Lexington, Kentucky]].

In 2001, AHSA changed its name to '''USA Equestrian''' (USAE) to represent the organization's role more effectively in the United States.  At that time, the organization had over 80,000 individual members.  There were more than 2,700 member competitions, 100 affiliate organizations, and 26 breeds and disciplines were recognized.

In 2003, USA Equestrian and the [[United States Equestrian Team]] (USET) joined together to take on responsibilities as a national governing body and became the '''United States Equestrian Federation'''.

In 2017, USEF rebranded to US Equestrian under the new President, Murray Kessler, launching the new campaign "Discover the Joy of Horse Sports."
