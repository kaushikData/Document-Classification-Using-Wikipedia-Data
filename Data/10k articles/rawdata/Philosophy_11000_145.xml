'''Applied ontology''' involves the practical application of [[ontological]] resources to specific domains, such as [[management]], [[Interpersonal relationship|relationships]], [[biomedicine]] or [[geography]]. Much work in applied ontology is carried out within the framework of the [[semantic web]].

==Applying ontology to relationships==
The challenge of applying ontology is ontology's emphasis on a [[world view]] [[orthogonal]] to [[epistemology]].  The emphasis is on being rather than on doing (as implied by "[[applied science|applied]]") or on [[knowledge|knowing]].  This is explored by philosophers and pragmatists like [[Fernando Flores]] and [[Martin Heidegger]].

One way in which that emphasis plays out is in the concept of "[[speech acts]]": acts of promising, ordering, apologizing, requesting, inviting or sharing.  The study of these acts from an ontological perspective is one of the driving forces behind relationship-oriented applied ontology.&lt;ref&gt;

 | quote = Talk all you want to, Flores says, but if you want to act powerfully, you need to master 'speech acts': language rituals that build trust between colleagues and customers, word practices that open your eyes to new possibilities. Speech acts are powerful because most of the actions that people engage in -- in business, in marriage, in parenting -- are carried out through conversation.
 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; This can involve concepts championed by [[Ordinary-language philosophy|ordinary language]] philosophers like [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]].

Applying ontology can also involve looking at the relationship between a person's world and that person's actions.  The context or [[Heideggerian terminology#Clearing|clearing]] is highly influenced by the being of the subject or the field of [[Category of being|being]] itself.  This view is highly influenced by the philosophy of [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/phenomenology/ |title=Phenomenology |date=2013-12-16 |work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |publisher=Stanford University}}&lt;/ref&gt; the works of Heidegger, and others.&lt;ref&gt;

==Ontological perspectives==
Social scientists adopt a number of ontological approaches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Raddon|first1=Arwen|title=Epistemology &amp; Ontology in Social Science Research|url=https://www2.le.ac.uk/colleges/ssah/documents/research-training-presentations/EpistFeb10.pdf|website=le.ac.uk/|publisher=University of Leicster|accessdate=28 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some of these are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Research Methodology: Ontology|url=https://research-methodology.net/research-philosophy/ontology/|website=Research Methodologies|publisher=research-methodology.net|accessdate=28 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Best friends forever'''" ("'''BFF'''") is a phrase that describes a close [[friendship]].

==Definition==
A BFF is a term for someone's best friend&lt;ref&gt;New Oxford American Dictionary, 
[http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/bff  BFF], Official website, UK, retrieved August 30, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; and are characterized by  trust, and permanence.&lt;ref name=Levine_ch1&gt;{{citation |chapter=Ch. 1: Understanding Female Friendships |title=Best Friends Forever |author=Irene S. Levine |publisher=Penguin |year=2009 |isbn=9781590203705}}&lt;/ref&gt; BFFs are usually in close contact and have shared experiences, such as attending the same school or sharing musical tastes. Relationships described as BFF are common in [[high school]] and often decline when the parties go to college.&lt;ref name=Oswald&gt;{{citation |title=Best friends forever?: High school best friendships and the transition to college |author=Debra L. Oswald, Eddie M. Clark |year=2003 |doi=10.1111/1475-6811.00045 |journal=Personal Relationships |volume=10 |issue=2 |pages=187–196}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term BFF does not necessarily convey exclusivity; depending on a person's individual interpretation or philosophy of the concept of "BFF", an individual may not have more than one BFF simultaneously.&lt;ref name="psychologytoday.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-friendship-doctor/201009/bff-dob-1996-welcome-the-oxford-english-dictionary|title=BFF: DOB 1996 - Welcome to the Oxford English Dictionary|work=Psychology Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
Although the concept of having or being a "best friend" is ageless, the acronym BFF was popularized as a quick way for friends to sign off and express their positive feelings for one another while instant-messaging (IM-ing) on the computer or sending a text message on cell phones.&lt;ref name="psychologytoday.com"/&gt;

The acronym "BFF" was added to the [[New Oxford American Dictionary]] on 16 September 2010.&lt;ref name="oup.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.oup.com/2010/09/noad3/|title=My BFF just told me "TTYL" is in the dictionary. LMAO. - OUPblog|work=OUPblog}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dictionary states that the acronym BFF originated in 1996.&lt;ref name="oup.com"/&gt;

==Cultural perception==
According to a survey in [[France]], the BFF friendship is a concept that occupies a certain place on [[social networks]].&lt;ref&gt;Mina Soundiram, lexpress.fr, [http://www.lexpress.fr/styles/psycho/amitie-appartenir-a-une-bande-est-signe-d-un-bon-equilibre-de-vie_1745044.html Amitié: appartenir à une bande est devenu un signe de réussite sociale], France , December 14, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; This value is reassuring, especially for the millennial generation that experiences a divorce frequently. It is a sign of social success and a balanced life.

A large survey of friendship in the UK in 2003 found that on average, people had nine close friends.&lt;ref name=Levine_ch1/&gt; In elementary and middle school, best friendships often last less than one full academic year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Berndt | first1 = T.

[[Barbara Delinsky]] described a BFF as "someone you don't have to see every day to still connect with, someone who loves you whether you talk often or not, someone who would drop everything and catch the next flight if you needed her.  It's someone who couldn't care less where or what she eats, as long as she's with you."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://barbaradelinsky.com/2012/02/what-is-a-bff/|title=What is a BFF?|work=barbaradelinsky.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the media==
In a 1997 episode, season 3 episode 25, of ''[[Friends]]'', [[Lisa Kudrow]]'s character, [[Phoebe Buffay]], uses the term.

Michael Scott uses the abbreviation as well in S2E2 of "[[The Office (U.S. TV series)]]".

''[[Paris Hilton's My New BFF]]'', also known as ''[[My New BFF]]'', is a competitive reality television show in which Paris Hilton searches for her new BFF.

''[[Best Friends Forever]]'' was an American television comedy series that ran on [[NBC]] from April 4, to June 1, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2012/02/21/community-returns-march-15-at-8pm-premieres-for-bent-best-friends-forever-and-betty-whites-off-their-rockers/121031/ |title='Community' Returns March 15 at 8pm + Premieres for 'Bent,' 'Best Friends Forever' and 'Betty White's Off Their Rockers' |work=TV by the Numbers |last=Seidman |first=Robert |date=February 21, 2012 |accessdate=February 21, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120224030204/http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2012/02/21/community-returns-march-15-at-8pm-premieres-for-bent-best-friends-forever-and-betty-whites-off-their-rockers/121031/ |archivedate=February 24, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, [[social networking service]] [[Myspace]] launched "BFF", an online game show series that tested how well best friends knew each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |author= |publication-date=April 2, 2009 |title=MySpace Launches "BFF," Online Game Show Series |work= [[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]] |page= |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=a3fgJyRSZD6I |accessdate=March 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Best Friends Forever (South Park)]]'' is an episode of [[Comedy Central]]'s [[South Park]], which first aired 30 March 2005, based on the [[Terri Schiavo case]].

==Academic studies==
[[Eileen Kennedy-Moore]] says that parents can help children cope with a conflict between friends through strategies such as empathizing, discouraging retaliation, and encouraging relationship repair.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy-Moore, E. (2012). [http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/growing-friendships/201205/make-new-friends-keep-the-old-or-not Make new friends but keep the old...or not.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the BFF concept was a part of a BFF contract "to encourage the signatories to work through their differences before splitting up."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |author= |publication-date=February 11, 2010 |title=The BFF Contract makes friendships a lasting proposition |work= [[Sarasota Herald Tribune]] |page= B1|url= http://www.heraldtribune.com/article/20100211/ARTICLE/2111063|accessdate=March 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In their article "Friendship and Natural Selection" in July, 2014, Nicholas Christakis and James Fowler reported a positive correlation between close friendships and common genotypes, indicating that DNA similarities may be a causal factor in establishing friendships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/111/Supplement_3/10796.short|title=Friendship and natural selection|author=Nicholas A. Christakis | doi=10.1073/pnas.1400825111|volume=111|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|pages=10796–10801|arxiv=1308.5257|bibcode=2014PNAS..111S0796C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a study conducted at the University of Oxford, Tamas David-Barrett and his colleagues reported that there is an unusually large number of profile pictures on Facebook that depict two women.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Women Favour Dyadic Relationships, but Men Prefer Clubs: Cross-Cultural Evidence from Social Networking|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0118329|journal = PLoS ONE|date = 2015-03-16|pmc = 4361571|pmid = 25775258|pages = e0118329|volume = 10|issue = 3|doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0118329|first = Tamas|last = David-Barrett|first2 = Anna|last2 = Rotkirch|first3 = James|last3 = Carney|first4 = Isabel|last4 = Behncke Izquierdo|first5 = Jaimie A.|last5 = Krems|first6 = Dylan|last6 = Townley|first7 = Elinor|last7 = McDaniell|first8 = Anna|last8 = Byrne-Smith|first9 = Robin I.

After eliminating the alternative hypotheses, the study concluded that the finding suggests that (a) close friendship formation patterns are universal among humans, and (b) there is a marked gender difference in the propensity to form lasting friendship due to an evolutionary ultimate cause.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This suggests that the BFF concept, albeit with a different name, may exist in many cultures, going back to evolutionary times. Recent studies have also shown that close friends are treated as siblings&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rotkirch|first1=Anna|last2=Lyons|first2=Minna|last3=David-Barrett|first3=Tamas|last4=Jokela|first4=Markus|title=Gratitude for Help among Adult Friends and Siblings|journal=Evolutionary Psychology|date=1 October 2014|volume=12|url=http://evp.sagepub.com/content/12/4/147470491401200401.short}}&lt;/ref&gt; throughout the lifespan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=David-Barrett|first1=Tamas|last2=Behncke Izquierdo|first2=Isabel|last3=Carney|first3=James|last4=Nowak|first4=Katharina|last5=Launay|first5=Jacques|last6=Rotkirch|first6=Anna|title=Life course similarities on social networking sites|journal=Advances in Life Course Research|date=14 May 2016|doi=10.1016/j.alcr.2016.04.002|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1040260816300247|volume=30|pages=84–89}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Commercial use ==
Companies like [[Coca-Cola|Coca Cola]] have used the expression on some of their Cola products. Their cans say "Share a Diet Coke with your BFF".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coca-colacompany.com/press-center/press-releases/coca-cola-celebrates-a-summer-of-sharing#TCCC Coca-Cola Celebrates a Summer of Sharing], Coca Cola Press Release June 10, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Black Mass: Apocalyptic Religion and the Death of Utopia''''' is a [[non-fiction]] book by [[John N. Gray]] published in 2007. Gray was at the time the School Professor of European Thought at the [[London School of Economics]] and in the book he further develops his critique of [[social progress]]. In recent history he looks at the [[New Right]] government of [[Margaret Thatcher]] and the [[neoconservatism|neoconservative]] government of [[George W. Bush]]. He also connects [[totalitarianism]], that is [[communism]] and [[nazism]], with [[millenarianism|millenarianist]] movements in the [[Middle Ages]], citing examples such as that of [[John of Leiden]], who led [[Münster Rebellion|a rebellion]] in the German city of [[Münster]] in 1534. In here he is helped by the work of [[Norman Cohn]], ''[[The Pursuit of the Millennium]]''. His main thesis is that the influence of said religious movements created the secular, [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] belief in social progress. And this [[philosophy of history]], known as [[teleology]], has contaminated the contemporary ''isms'', including [[classical liberalism]].

The book is split into six chapters, each of which is around 40 pages and is in turn split into sub-chapters:
# The Death of Utopia
# Enlightenment and Terror in the Twentieth Century
# Utopia Enters the Mainstream
# The Americanization of the Apocalypse
# Armed Missionaries
# Post-Apocalypse

{{Mahayana Buddhism}}
The '''Bodhisattva Precepts''' ({{CJKV|t=菩薩戒|p=Púsà Jiè}}, [[Japanese language|Japanese]]: ''bosatsukai'') are a set of moral codes used in [[Mahayana]] Buddhism to advance a practitioner along the path to becoming a [[Bodhisattva]]. Traditionally, monastics observed the basic moral code in Buddhism, the [[Prātimokṣa]] (such as that of the [[Dharmaguptaka]]), but in the Mahayana tradition, monks may observe the Bodhisattva Precepts as well.

==Sets of Precepts==

===''Brahmajala Sutra''===
The ''[[Brahmajala Sutra (Mahayana)|Brahmajala Sutra]]'', translated by [[Kumārajīva]] (c. 400 CE), has a list of ten major and forty-eight minor Bodhisattva vows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|editor1-last=Buswell|editor1-first=Robert Jr|editor2-last=Lopez|editor2-first=Donald S. Jr.|editor1-link=Robert Buswell Jr.|editor2-link=Donald S. Lopez Jr.|title=Princeton Dictionary of Buddhism (bodhisattvaśīla)|date=2013|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|isbn=9780691157863|page=137}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bodhisattva Precepts may be often called the "Brahma Net Precepts" ({{zh|c=梵網戒|p=Fànwǎng Jiè}}), particularly in Buddhist scholarship, although other sets of bodhisattva precepts may be found in other texts as well. Typically, in East Asian Mahayana traditions, only the ten major precepts are considered the bodhisattva precepts. According to the sutra, the ten major bodhisattva precepts are in summary:&lt;ref name="Thanh 2000"&gt;{{cite web|last=Thanh |first=Minh |title=The Brahma Net Sutra |year=2000 |url=http://www.ymba.org/bns/bnstext.htm#m1 |publisher=New York: Sutra Translation Committee of the United States and Canada |accessdate=10 December 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110611151922/http://www.ymba.org/bns/bnstext.htm#m1 |archivedate=June 11, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Not to kill or encourage others to kill.
# Not to steal or encourage others to steal.
# Not to engage in licentious acts or encourage others to do so. A monk is expected to abstain from sexual conduct entirely.
# Not to use false words and speech, or encourage others to do so.
# Not to trade or sell alcoholic beverages or encourage others to do so.
# Not to broadcast the misdeeds or faults of the Buddhist assembly, nor encourage others to do so.
# Not to praise oneself and speak ill of others, or encourage others to do so.
# Not to be stingy, or encourage others to do so.
# Not to harbor anger or encourage others to be angry.
# Not to speak ill of the Buddha, the Dharma or the Sangha (lit. the Triple Jewel)) or encourage others to do so.

Breaking any of these precepts is described as a major offense in the sutra. A fuller description is as follows:&lt;ref name="Thanh 2000"/&gt;
{{quote|
# A disciple of the Buddha shall not himself kill, encourage others to kill, kill by expedient means, praise killing, rejoice at witnessing killing, or kill through incantation or deviant mantras. He must not create the causes, conditions, methods, or karma of killing, and shall not intentionally kill any living creature. As a Buddha's disciple, he ought to nurture a mind of compassion and filial piety, always devising expedient means to rescue and protect all beings. If instead, he fails to restrain himself and kills sentient beings without mercy, he commits a Parajika (major) offense. 
# A disciple of the Buddha must not himself steal or encourage others to steal, steal by expedient means, steal by means of incantation or deviant mantras. He should not create the causes, conditions, methods, or karma of stealing. No valuables or possessions, even those belonging to ghosts and spirits or thieves and robbers, be they as small as a needle or blade of grass, may be stolen. As a Buddha's disciple, he ought to have a mind of mercy, compassion, and filial piety -- always helping people earn merits and achieve happiness. If instead, he steals the possessions of others, he commits a Parajika offense. 
# A disciple of the Buddha must not engage in licentious acts or encourage others to do so. [As a monk] he should not have sexual relations with any female -- be she a human, animal, deity or spirit -- nor create the causes, conditions, methods, or karma of such misconduct. Indeed, he must not engage in improper sexual conduct with anyone. A Buddha's disciple ought to have a mind of filial piety -- rescuing all sentient beings and instructing them in the Dharma of purity and chastity. If instead, he lacks compassion and encourages others to engage in sexual relations promiscuously, including with animals and even their mothers, daughters, sisters, or other close relatives, he commits a Parajika offense. 
# A disciple of the Buddha must not himself use false words and speech, or encourage others to lie or lie by expedient means. He should not involve himself in the causes, conditions, methods, or karma of lying, saying that he has seen what he has not seen or vice versa, or lying implicitly through physical or mental means.  As a Buddha's disciple, he ought to maintain Right Speech and Right Views always, and lead all others to maintain them as well. If instead, he causes wrong speech, wrong views or evil karma in others, he commits a Parajika offense. 
# A disciple of the Buddha must not trade in alcoholic beverages or encourage others to do so. He should not create the causes, conditions, methods, or karma of selling any intoxicant whatsoever, for intoxicants are the causes and conditions of all kinds of offenses. As a Buddha's disciple, he ought to help all sentient beings achieve clear wisdom. If instead, he causes them to have upside-down, topsy-turvy thinking, he commits a Parajika offense. 
# A disciple of the Buddha must not himself broadcast the misdeeds or infractions of Bodhisattva-clerics or Bodhisattva-laypersons, or of [ordinary] monks and nuns -- nor encourage others to do so. He must not create the causes, conditions, methods, or karma of discussing the offenses of the assembly. As a Buddha's disciple, whenever he hears evil persons, externalists or followers of the Two Vehicles speak of practices contrary to the Dharma or contrary to the precepts within the Buddhist community, he should instruct them with a compassionate mind and lead them to develop wholesome faith in the Mahayana. If instead, he discusses the faults and misdeeds that occur within the assembly, he commits a Parajika offense. 
# A disciple of the Buddha shall not praise himself and speak ill of others, or encourage others to do so. He must not create the causes, conditions, methods, or karma of praising himself and disparaging others. As a disciple of the Buddha, he should be willing to stand in for all sentient beings and endure humiliation and slander -- accepting blame and letting sentient beings have all the glory. If instead, he displays his own virtues and conceals the good points of others, thus causing them to suffer slander, he commits a Parajika offense. 
# A disciple of the Buddha must not be stingy or encourage others to be stingy. He should not create the causes, conditions, methods, or karma of stinginess. As a Bodhisattva, whenever a destitute person comes for help, he should give that person what he needs. If instead, out of anger and resentment, he denies all assistance -- refusing to help with even a penny, a needle, a blade of grass, even a single sentence or verse or a phrase of Dharma, but instead scolds and abuses that person -- he commits a Parajika offense. 
# A disciple of the Buddha shall not harbor anger or encourage others to be angry. He should not create the causes, conditions, methods, or karma of anger. As a disciple of the Buddha, he ought to be compassionate and filial, helping all sentient beings develop the good roots of non-contention. If instead, he insults and abuses sentient beings, or even transformation beings [such as deities and spirits], with harsh words, hitting them with his fists or feet, or attacking them with a knife or club -- or harbors grudges even when the victim confesses his mistakes and humbly seeks forgiveness in a soft, conciliatory voice -- the disciple commits a Parajika offense. 
# A Buddha's disciple shall not himself speak ill of the Triple Jewel or encourage others to do so. He must not create the causes, conditions, methods or karma of slander. If a disciple hears but a single word of slander against the Buddha from externalists or evil beings, he experiences a pain similar to that of three hundred spears piercing his heart. How then could he possibly slander the Triple Jewel himself? Hence, if a disciple lacks faith and filial piety towards the Triple Jewel, and even assists evil persons or those of aberrant views to slander the Triple Jewel, he commits a Parajika offense.}}

===''Bodhisattvabhumi''===
[[Asanga]] (circa 300 AD) delineated 18 major vows and forty-six minor vows in the "Bodhisattvabhumi" section of the ''[[Yogacarabhumi-sastra|Yogācārabhūmi Śāstra]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Gyatso 1995, pp.13&amp;ndash;34&lt;/ref&gt; These Bodhisattva vows are still used in all four major traditions of [[Tibetan Buddhism]]. The eighteen major vows (as actions to be abandoned) are as follows:
# Praising oneself or belittling others due to attachment to receiving material offerings, praise and respect.
# Not giving material aid or (due to miserliness) not teaching the Dharma to those who are suffering and without a protector.
# Not listening to others' apologies or striking others.
# Abandoning the Mahayana by saying that Mahayana texts are not the words of Buddha or teaching what appears to be the Dharma but is not. 
# Taking things belonging to the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], [[Dharma]] or [[Sangha (Buddhism)|Sangha]].
# Abandoning the holy Dharma by saying that texts which teach the three vehicles are not the Buddha's word.
# With anger depriving ordained ones of their robes, beating and imprisoning them or causing them to lose their ordination even if they have impure morality, for example, by saying that being ordained is useless.
# Committing any of the five extremely negative actions: (1) killing one's mother, (2) killing one's father, (3) killing an [[arhat]], (4) intentionally drawing blood from a Buddha or (5) causing schism in the Sangha community by supporting and spreading sectarian views.
# Holding distorted views (which are contrary to the teaching of Buddha, such as denying the existence of the Three Jewels or the law of cause and effect etc.)
# Destroying towns, villages, cities or large areas by means such as fire, bombs, pollution or black magic.
# Teaching emptiness to those whose minds are unprepared.
# Causing those who have entered the Mahayana to turn away from working for the full enlightenment of Buddhahood and encouraging them to work merely for their own liberation from suffering.
# Causing others to abandon their [[Prātimokṣa]] vows.
# Belittling the [[Śrāvakayāna]] or [[Pratyekabuddhayāna]] (by holding and causing others to hold the view that these vehicles do not abandon attachment and other delusions).
# Falsely stating that oneself has realised profound [[Śūnyatā|emptiness]] and that if others meditate as one has, they will realize emptiness and become as great and as highly realized as oneself.
# Taking gifts from others who were encouraged to give you things originally intended as offerings to the Three Jewels. Not giving things to the Three Jewels that others have given you to give to them, or accepting property stolen from the Three Jewels.
# Causing those engaged in calm-abiding meditation to give it up by giving their belongings to those who are merely reciting texts or making bad disciplinary rules which cause a spiritual community not to be harmonious.
# Abandoning either of the two types of [[bodhicitta]] (aspiring and engaging).

According to [[Atiśa]], the Prātimokṣa vows are the basis for the Bodhisattva vows. Without keeping one of the different sets of Prātimokṣa vows (in one of the existing Vinaya schools), there can be no Bodhisattva vow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Great Kagyu Masters: The Golden Lineage Treasury |last=Gyaltsen |first=Konchog |year=1990 |publisher=Snow Lion Publications |location=Ithaca |isbn=9780937938881 | oclc=22210145 |pages=154&amp;ndash;86}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Sixteen Bodhisattva Precepts in Sōtō Zen===

In the [[Sōtō]] school of [[Zen]], the founder [[Dōgen]] established a somewhat expanded version of the Bodhisattva Precepts for use by both priests and lay followers, based on both Brahma Net Sutra and other sources.  Many various translations exist, the following is used by [[John Daido Loori]], [[rōshi]] at the [[Zen Mountain Monastery]]:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mro.org/mro.html Mountains and Rivers Order of Zen Buddhism] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070821220000/http://www.mro.org/mro.html |date=August 21, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== The Three Treasures ====
*Taking refuge in the Buddha
*Taking refuge in the Dharma
*Taking refuge in the Sangha

The Three Treasures are universally known in Buddhism as the Three Refuges or [[Three Jewels]].

==== The Three Pure Precepts ====
*Do not create Evil
*Practice Good
*Actualize Good For Others

These are also known as the ''Three Root Precepts'', and are mentioned in the [[Brahmajala Sutra (Mahayana)|Brahma Net Sutra]] as well.

==== The Ten Grave Precepts ====
*Respect life – Do not kill
*Be giving – Do not steal
*Honor the body – Do not misuse sexuality
*Manifest truth – Do not lie
*Proceed clearly – Do not cloud the mind
*See the perfection – Do not speak of others' errors and faults
*Realize self and others as one – Do not elevate the self and blame others
*Give generously – Do not be withholding
*Actualize harmony – Do not be angry
*Experience the intimacy of things – Do not defile the Three Treasures

==Traditional uses==

===Chinese, Korean, and Vietnamese traditions===
The Chinese [[Chan Buddhism|Chan]] monk, [[Yin Shun]], wrote of the Bodhisattva Precepts, "To cultivate [[bodhicitta|bodhi mind]] means to accept the bodhisattva precepts and practice the ten good deeds."&lt;ref name="yin-shun"&gt;{{cite book | last = Shih | first = Yin-Shun | title = The Way to Buddhahood | 
publisher = Wisdom Publications | year = 1998 | isbn = 0-86171-133-5 | page=329}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In practice, the acceptance of and ordination of the Bodhisattva Precepts varies greatly depending on the school of Mahayana Buddhism. In [[East Asian Buddhism]], a fully ordained monk or nun ordains under the traditional [[prātimokṣa]] precepts first according to the [[vinaya]] of the [[Dharmaguptaka]]. In the Chinese tradition, this is called the ''Four Part Vinaya'' ({{zh|c=四分律|p=Sìfēnlǜ}}). Then as a supplement, the same disciple would undertake the Bodhisattva Precepts as well.

Monks and nuns are not considered "ordained" by the Bodhisattva Precepts, but rather by the "Four Part Vinaya", while the Bodhisattva Precepts served to strengthen the Mahayana ideals.&lt;ref name="Ford"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ford|first=James L.|title=Jokei and Buddhist Devotion in Early Medieval Japan|year=2006|publisher=Oxford University Press, USA|isbn=0-19-518814-4|pages=131, 132}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the Bodhisattva Precepts are given to lay disciples to strengthen their devotion to Buddhism as well.&lt;ref name="Ford" /&gt; Such disciples often take the basic [[Five Precepts]] and then the Bodhisattva precepts as a supplement.

===Japanese traditions===
In [[Buddhism in Japan]], the "Four-Part Vinaya" was deemphasized with the rise of [[Saichō]] and the [[Tendai]] sect&lt;ref name="Ford" /&gt; and a new monastic community was set up exclusively using the ''Brahmajala Sutra''{{'}}s Bodhisattva Precepts. All Vinaya ordinations at the time were given at [[Tōdai-ji]] in [[Nara, Nara|Nara]] and Saichō had wanted to both undermine the power of the Nara Buddhist community and to establish a "purely Mahayana lineage",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Abe | first = Ryuichi | title = The Weaving of Mantra: Kukai and the Construction of Esoteric Buddhist Discourse | publisher = Columbia University Press | year = 1999 | isbn = 0-231-11286-6 | pages=40–44, 50–52}}&lt;/ref&gt; and made a request to the Emperor to Later Buddhist sects, which was granted 7 days after his death in 822.

Later Buddhist sects in Japan, including the [[Sōtō|Sōtō school of Zen]], [[Jōdo-shū]] and [[Shingon Buddhism]], adopted a similar approach to their monastic communities and exclusive use of the Bodhisattva Precepts. By this time in Japan, the Vinaya lineage had all but died out and Japan's remote location made it difficult to reestablish though limited efforts by [[Jōkei (monk)|Jōkei]] and the [[Shingon Risshu]] revived it for a time. This was further enforced during the [[Meiji period]], when the {{nihongo|Nikujiku Saitai Law|肉食妻帯||}} of 1872 decriminalized clerical marriage and meat-eating.&lt;ref&gt;Horii, Mitsutoshi (2006).

'''''Cahiers pour l'Analyse''''' was a [[magazine]] published in [[Paris]] in the 1960s. Ten issues appeared between 1966 and 1969. It was "guided by the examples of [[Georges Canguilhem]], [[Jacques Lacan]] and [[Louis Althusser]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Cahiers pour l'Analyse (An electronic edition) |url=http://cahiers.kingston.ac.uk/ |publisher=Centre for Research in Modern European Philosophy |accessdate=2018-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Edited by a small group of Althusser's students at the [[Ecole Normale Supérieure]], the magazine appeared during what were – arguably – the most fertile and productive years in French philosophy during the whole of the twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Overview - About the website |url=http://cahiers.kingston.ac.uk/overview.html |publisher=Centre for Research in Modern European Philosophy |accessdate=2018-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Carl Davidson''' is a former student leader of the [[New Left]] of the 1960s, serving as a Vice President and National Secretary of [[Students for a Democratic Society]]. From 1968 to 1976, he worked on the ''[[National Guardian|Guardian]]'' newsweekly as a writer and news editor. Born in 1943, he graduated with a B.A. in [[philosophy]] from [[Penn State]], and later taught and did graduate work at the [[University of Nebraska]], between 1965 and 1966.

[[File:NLN Carl Davidson.jpg|thumb|Carl Davidson at a new SDS convention, Chicago, 2006.]]

Today he is a national co-chair of the [[Committees of Correspondence for Democracy and Socialism]] and a national board member of [[Solidarity Economy Network]], advocating a mixture of [[market socialism]] and worker ownership. Recently Davidson led Progressives for Obama, now called Progressive America Rising,  as an independent left-progressive initiative, in part to convince those on the radical left to pursue what he considers more pragmatic alternatives. He has also worked on a leadership level with [[United for Peace and Justice]] and its local affiliates. After organizing for many years in New York City and Chicago, he now resides in Beaver County, PA, near Pittsburgh, where he was born and raised.

'''Carl A. Raschke'''  (1944&lt;ref&gt;https://viaf.org/viaf/51706472/&lt;/ref&gt;-) is an American philosopher and [[theology|theologian]]. Raschke is a Past Chair and Professor of [[Religious Studies]] Department at the [[University of Denver]], specializing in [[continental philosophy]], the [[philosophy of religion]] and the [[theory of religion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Carl |last=Raschke |jstor=1462219 |title=The End of Theology | work=Journal of the American Academy of Religion |volume=46 |issue=2 |date=June 1978 |pages=159–79 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also listed with the affiliated faculty of the [[Global Center for Advanced Studies]].  Raschke is known in part for his research on [[postmodern theology]], [[popular religion]], [[philosophy of culture]] and [[philosophy of technology]]. He received his B.A. from [[Pomona College]], his M.A. from [[Graduate Theological Union|The Graduate Theological Union,]] and his Ph.D. from [[Harvard University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.du.edu/ahss/religiousstudies/facultystaff/raschke.html |title=Carl Raschke &amp;#124; Faculty &amp; Staff &amp;#124; University of Denver |work=du.edu |year=2016 |accessdate=January 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Raschke is senior editor for ''The Journal for Cultural and Religious Theory'' and a regular contributor to ''Political Theology Today''.&lt;ref name="PTT"&gt;Raschke's contributions to ''Political Theology Today'' [http://www.politicaltheology.com/blog/author/craschke/ may be viewed on the publication's website].&lt;/ref&gt; A major focus of Raschke's work has been [[Postmodern philosophy|postmodernism]].  In recent years he has written on the [[theory of religion]] and [[political theology]].

During the late 1980s and 1990s, Raschke published works on (and made media appearances regarding) [[Satanism]], the [[occult]], [[heavy metal music]], and subjects such as ''[[Dungeons and Dragons]]''. In addition, Raschke was an [[expert witness]] on some cases involving Satanism, regularly made comments and appearances for the media on related topics, and advised the [[International Cultic Studies Association|American Family Foundation]]; Raschke's comments and work during this period, particularly his 1990 book ''Painted Black'', have been overwhelmingly condemned by scholars as inaccurate and repeatedly cited as having assisted in fueling the [[Satanic ritual abuse]] [[moral panic]] during the period, and Raschke's status as an "expert" on these topics has been criticized.

==Philosophical and Theological Contributions==
{{rewrite section|date=February 2016}}
A central focus of Raschke’s work has been on postmodern religious thought and postmodernism. According to ''The Encyclopedia of Postmodernism'', his “work has sought to expose a conceptual tangle in modernity’s approach to language, religion, and the body."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Encyclopedia of Postmodernism|last = Taylor|first = Victor E.|publisher = Psychology Press|year = 2003|isbn = |location = |pages = 330|last2 = Charles Winquist}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Raschke launched this project in the 1970s with the publication of an article in ''[[Harvard Theological Review|The Harvard Theological Review]]'' entitled “Meaning and Saying in Religion: Beyond Language Games,” in which he “argues that the failure of Anglo-American philosophy to adequately account for religious language reveals a deeper failure to account for the process of meaning-formation at the heart of language itself.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; His first major book, ''The Alchemy of the Word: Language and the End of Theology'' (1979), which was republished in 2000 as ''The End of Theology'', lays out this agenda in detail with reliance in particular on the philosophy of the later [[Martin Heidegger]]. ''Fire and Roses: Postmodernity and the Thought of the Body'' (1996) explores these interconnections by seeking to “reconcile erotic and tragic discourses through the thought of the Word made flesh.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; An earlier work, entitled ''Theological Thinking: An In-Quiry'' (1988), investigates the interconnections between the languages of religion and science.

After the turn of the millennium, Raschke turned his attention to the impact of [[Postmodernism/Philosophy|postmodernism]] on Christian evangelical thought. His book, ''The Next Reformation: Why Evangelicals Must Embrace Postmodernity,'' explained how postmodern philosophy might transform present day evangelical theology, comparing it to [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] thought, in particular Martin Luther’s key doctrines of ''[[sola fide]]'' (“by faith alone”) and ''[[Sola scriptura|sola Scriptura]]'' (“according to Scripture alone"). He writes in this book that “the postmodernist revolution in philosophy…has tendered an environment where the Christian gospel can at last be disentangled from the centuries-long gnarl of scientism, rationalism, secularism, humanism, and skepticism.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Next Reformation: Why Evangelicals Must Embrace Postmodernity|last = Raschke|first = Carl|publisher = Baker Academic|year = 2004|isbn = |location = |pages = 20–21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reviewing the book, Brian C. Smith notes in ''Library Journal'' that Raschke challenges the conventional evangelical view of "postmodernism" and "exudes an embracing and accepting spirit toward it."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Review of "The Next Reformation"|last = Smith|first = Brian C.|date = 2005|journal = Library Journal|pages=119|doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt; A later book, entitled ''GloboChrist,'' published as part of a general series by [[Baker Publishing Group|Baker Academic]] Books, argued that the theory of the “rhizome,” first advanced by twentieth century French philosophers [[Gilles Deleuze]] and [[Félix Guattari|Felix Guattari]], can be used to model the future of the Christian church in the new era of globalization. In an interview with the [[Evangelical Philosophical Society]] in 2009, Raschke explains he borrowed this term because “globalization is an ongoing, simultaneous transformation of nations, cultures, and religious outlooks and practices everywhere on the planet which they term ‘de-territorialization.’”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://blog.epsociety.org/2009/01/interview-with-carl-raschke-globochrist.asp|title = Interview with Carl Raschke: GloboChrist|date = January 18, 2009|access-date = 2016-01-13|website = Evangelical Philosophical Society Blog|publisher = Evangelical Philosophical Society|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Commenting on ''GloboChrist'' scholar Richard Haney criticizes the book for its "breezy terminology", but concludes the book "will challenge Christians to think missionally and philosophically at the same time."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Review of GloboChrist|last = Hanaey|first = Richard|journal = Interpretation |volume=64 |issue=2 |date=2010 |pages=216|doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In his contribution among three authors to the volume ''Faith and Reason: Three Views'',  Raschke has argued that the gospel represented a departure from Greek and Enlightenment philosophies, and that faith and reason are "in tension" with each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=6LzjAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA68&amp;dq=carl+raschke&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjhnYfOyZHKAhXKqR4KHaJ9AuA4ChDoAQhIMAY#v=onepage&amp;q=carl%20raschke&amp;f=false|title = Faith and Reason: Three Views|date = 2014|access-date = |website = |publisher = Intervarsity Press, p. 20.|last = Wilkens|first = Steve}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, Raschke has written on the general [[Theories about religions|theory of religion]]. His book,''The Revolution in Religious Theory: Toward A Semiotics of the Event,'' lays out how postmodern philosophy has impacted and reshaped both classical and contemporary paradigms of how we understand what is meant by the “religious.” In an interview with David Hale, Raschke criticizes many scholars of religion, particularly in regard to "cults", for approaching their subject as a "pseudo-phenomenology" that "does not seek to probe, or dialectically reflect, beyond the bare given."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Not Your Grandmother's Theory of Religion: An Interview With Carl Raschke.|last = Hale|first = David|date = 2014|journal = Journal for Cultural and Religious Theory |volume=14 |issue=2 |pages=2|doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In reviewing the book, McGill University scholar Nathan Strunk writes that Raschke criticizes the history of religious studies as colonializing with a tendency toward "Aryanization", and thus "readers should not be surprised if some areas they consider sacred are tread over lightly."&lt;ref&gt;Strunk, Nathan. Review of "The Revolution in Religious Theory," ''Religious Studies Review'' 3(2013), p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;  His latest book, ''Force of God: Political Theology and the Crisis of Liberal Democracy,'' leverages the philosophies of [[Michel Foucault]] and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] to analyze from what he terms a “genealogical” standpoint the ongoing global economic crisis and the dysfunctions of democracy.

Raschke has been credited with being "one of the first to register the importance of [[Jacques Derrida|Derrida]]'s work for postmodern philosophies of religion ."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=dLqvZPOecVUC&amp;pg=PA505&amp;dq=carl+raschke&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjhnYfOyZHKAhXKqR4KHaJ9AuA4ChDoAQg8MAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=carl%20raschke&amp;f=false The Blackwell Companion to Postmodern Theology, p 505.

Raschke has written and commented on topics such as [[Satanism]], ''[[Dungeons and Dragons]]'', [[heavy metal music]] and certain new religious movements. His work in this area as well as his role in the development of the [[Satanic ritual abuse]] [[moral panic]] of the late 1980s and early 1990s, in particular the book ''Painted Black'' (1990), have been much criticized in academia.

Particularly during the late 1980s and 1990s, Raschke regularly commented to the media on matters involving Satanism and the occult,&lt;ref name="MEDIA-COMMENTATOR"&gt;Stowers (1989).&lt;/ref&gt; advised the [[International Cultic Studies Association|American Family Foundation]] during the 1990s,&lt;ref name="ANSON-DARNELL"&gt;Anson &amp; Darnell (2006:115).&lt;/ref&gt; and appeared as an [[expert witness]] during trials purportedly involving Satanism.&lt;ref name="EXPERTWITNESS"&gt;Such as Missouri v. Roland. 808 S.W.2d 855 (1991) (viewable online: [http://www.leagle.com/decision/19911663808SW2d855_11627/STATE%20v.%20ROLAND#]), in which Raschke testified for the defense: "The court permitted witness Raschke to testify to the general tenets of satanism [''sic''], but, because he lacked any training in psychiatry or psychology, excluded his proffered testimony as to the effects of satanic beliefs on individuals. The professor did testify that satanic cults often employed violence and terror in enforcing secrecy and loyalty among their members."&lt;/ref&gt; Raschke has continued to accept media requests for comment on these topics, such as for an object purportedly involved in the murder of [[Jessica Ridgeway]] in 2012.&lt;ref name="REQUEST-FROM-MEDIA"&gt;Regarding an object purportedly connected with the murder of Jessica Ridgeway:&lt;br&gt;"Raschke notes that the cross contains three vertical scratches on one side and a zigzag and several nicks on the other. Raschke, who also studies cults, wouldn't speculate on the three vertical scratches, but said the zigzag and nicks could be significant. "The zigzag is a stylized 'S,'" he said. "It's like a lightning bolt. It probably has something to do with somebody who's into [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]] or wizardry or something like that. It could also be neo-Nazism." Raschke said the nicks adjacent to the zigzag are even more interesting. "Those look like somebody is stabbing the cross with a knife and may very well have been doing that because they hate Christians. It could be some kind of ritual way of showing (their) contempt for Christianity." (Hernandez 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

Reviewing ''Painted Black'' in 1991, scholar Jonathon S. Epstein writes: "''Painted Black'' adds additional fuel to the flames of hysteria surrounding satanism [''sic''] in America", that "what the book lacks is scholarship, it makes up for it in sweeping and unsupportable generalizations", and that … "''Painted Black'' cannot be taken seriously.&lt;ref name="EPSTEIN"&gt;Epstein (1991:439-440).&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995, scholar [[Wouter J. Hanegraaff]] writes "Raschke's eagerness to include everything "gnostic" into a "genealogy of darkness" (''Painted Black'', 133) inspires sloppy historical scholarship. … With a similar lack of sensitivity for the power of words and definitions, Raschke routinely uses "satanism" and "occultism" as synonyms (for instance, ''Painted Black'', 35-36). This careless attitude towards terminology leads to painfully inaccurate overviews (esp. ''Painted Black'', chapter 4)."&lt;ref name="HANEGRAAFF"&gt;Hanegraaff (1995:X).&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in 1998, scholar [[Phillip Jenkins]] cites Raschke's ''Painted Black'' next to [[Maury Terry]]'s ''Ultimate Evil'' and [[Larry Kahaner]]'s ''Cults That Kill'' along with an episode of [[Geraldo Rivera]]'s talk show (''[[Geraldo (TV series)|Geraldo]]'', "Devil Worship: Exposing Satan's Underground") as examples of major works that popularized the Satanic ritual abuse moral panic in the late 1980s and 1990s. Jenkins says "For several years, belief in the existence of satanic cults and ritual murder achieved wider credence in the United States than it had in any other society since that of sixteenth-century Europe", where the moral panic subsequently spread to areas of Europe, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa.&lt;ref name="JENKINS"&gt;Jenkins (1998:168-169).&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In an analysis of Raschke's role in adding fuel to the 1980s and early 1990s United States Satanic ritual abuse moral panic, scholar [[Eugene V. Gallagher]] (2004) notes that Raschke referred to critics of his works as "cult apologists" but says "the shrillness of Raschke's argument&amp;nbsp;... ultimately fails to compensate for the paucity of evidence behind it".&lt;ref name="GALLAGHER-188-189"&gt;Raschke (2004:188-189).&lt;/ref&gt; Referring to Raschke's ''Painted Black'', scholar [[Joshua Gunn]] (2005) writes that "Raschke's error-filled tome is frequently cited by seemingly secular academics who profess in a belief of Satanic ritual abuse".&lt;ref name="GUNN-283"&gt;Gunn (2005:283).&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholar [[Arthur Versluis]] (2006) is highly critical of Raschke's ''Painted Black'', which he describes as an "effort to awaken an American [[inquisition]]" and refers to the book as "breathless sensationalism".&lt;ref name=VERSLUIS-108&gt;Verlius (2006:108).&lt;/ref&gt; Versluis cites Raschke's description of the roleplaying game ''[[Dungeons and Dragons]]'' as a means of initiation into "[[black magic]]" as an example and says that "it is scarcely possible to exaggerate the hysterical nature of this book, nor the number of errors in it (although some have tried at least to chronicle them)."&lt;ref name="VERSLUIS-107"&gt;Versluis (2006:107).&lt;/ref&gt; Versluis is critical of Raschke's role in the Satanic ritual abuse moral panic, noting the false imprisonments that the moral panic resulted in, and says, regarding ''Painted Black'', "This is dangerous stuff indeed&amp;nbsp;... Fortunately, Raschke's book didn't have the kind of impact he so clearly wanted: to fully awaken the medieval Inquisitorial spirit. But&amp;nbsp;... the 1980s and the 1990s 'Satanic panic' was bad enough."&lt;ref name="VERSLUIS-109"&gt;Versluis (2006:109)&lt;/ref&gt;

Comparing Raschke's ''Painted Black'' to [[Tipper Gore]]'s 1987 book ''Raising PG Kids in an X-Rated Society'' in that Gore "invoked Satan as the seducer of youth", scholar [[Robert Latham (scholar)|Robert Latham]] (2007) refers to Carl Raschke as "a tabloid 'expert' on 'cults'". Latham is particularly critical of Raschke's claims that [[MTV]] "had put an entire generation of teens at risk of satanic contamination" and writes that "Raschke's indictment of the resultant '[[Apollonian and Dionysian|Dionysian]] frenzy'&amp;nbsp;... indiscriminately conflated acts of violence, sexual 'deviance', and supernaturalism in a millennial scenario of youth's spectacular degeneracy."&lt;ref name="LATHAM"&gt;Latham (2007:126).&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars Asbjørn Dyrendal, James R. Lewis, and Jesper AA. Petersen (2015) provide examples of Raschke "quoting&amp;nbsp;... misleadingly and out of context" and "hav[ing] forgotten all his academic training, and reverted, in a telling manner, to the folklore of evil". The scholars characterize Raschke as an "until-then well-reputed academic" (referring to the publication of ''Painted Black'').&lt;ref name="DYRENDAL-ET-AL"&gt;Dyrendal, Lewis, and Petersen (2015:102-104)&lt;/ref&gt; Scholar [[Joseph P. Laycock]] is highly critical of statements that Raschke made in the 1980s and early 1990s regarding Satanism in popular culture, noting that Raschke "is one of the few academics who embraced the moral panic over Satanism and role-playing games in the 1980s".&lt;ref name="LAYCOCK-59"&gt;Laycock (2015:59).&lt;/ref&gt; Analyzing Raschke's works on heavy metal, scholar [[Robert Walser (musicologist)|Robert Walser]] (2013) says that "the terrorism of Raschke and similar critics depends upon two tactics: anecdote and insinuation. Raschke himself cites a group of sociologists of religion who determined that there was 'not a shred of evidence' that Satanism is a problem in America, directly contradicting the thesis of Rashke's book."&lt;ref name="WALSER-142"&gt;Walser 2013: 142).&lt;/ref&gt;

Raschke's comments regarding [[Heathenry (new religious movement)|Heathenry]] have also been criticized. According to a 1998 interview with the [[Southern Poverty Law Center|SPLC]], Raschke claimed that "a recent [[bioterrorism|biological terrorism threat]] in New York City may have come from Asatrúers [''sic'']" (quote from SPLC 1998, reprinted in Gardell 2003). Citing this claim as an example of the reception of Heathenry in his overview, scholar [[Mattias Gardell]] (2003) says "I have found nothing to substantiate the alarmist allegations of Raschke".&lt;ref name="GARDELL"&gt;Gardell (2003:275). The 1998 SPLC interview Gardell refers to may be read online at the SPLC website: [https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/intelligence-report/1998/new-brand-racist-odinist-religion-march]&lt;/ref&gt;

In an article on [[Wicca]] and media for the ''Oxford Handbook of Religion and the News Media'' (2012), scholar [[Sarah M. Pike]] describes how a media report during the trial for the [[West Memphis Three]] "failed to consult experts on Wicca and Satanism" but rather referred to material by Raschke, who she describes as a "widely discredited 'Satanism expert'".&lt;ref name="PIKE-290"&gt;Pike (2012:289-290).&lt;/ref&gt;

Raschke has written and commented in the media extensively on contemporary religion, especially regarding the [[New Age|New Age Movement]]. His most cited and often controversial book on this is ''The Interruption of Eternity'' (1980). Other writings of this kind include "The New Age: The Movement Toward Self-Discovery",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|contribution = The New Age: The Movement Toward Self-Discovery |title=New Age Spirituality: An Assessment|last = Raschke|first = Carl|publisher = Westminster/John Knox Press|year = 1993|isbn = |location = Louisville, KY|pages = 121–43|editor-last = Ferguson|editor-first = Duncan}}&lt;/ref&gt; "New Age Spirituality"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|contribution = New Age Spirituality |title=Spirituality and the Secular Quest|last = Raschke|first = Carl|publisher = Crossroad Publishing|year = 1996|isbn = |location = New York|pages = |editor-last = Van Ness|editor-first = Peter}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "New Age Economics".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|contribution =New Age Economics |title=Not Necessarily the New Age: Critical Essays|last = Raschke|first = Carl|publisher = Prometheus Books|year = 1988|isbn = |location = Buffalo, NY|pages = |editor-last = Basil|editor-first = Robert}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Copenhagen School''' of security studies is a school of academic thought with its origins in [[international relations]] theorist [[Barry Buzan]]'s book ''[[People, States and Fear: The National Security Problem in International Relations]]'', first published in 1983. The Copenhagen School places particular emphasis on the non-military aspects of security, representing a shift away from traditional security studies.&lt;ref name="Collins"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/933606971 |title=Contemporary Security Studies |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2016 |isbn=9780198708315 |editor-last=Collins |editor-first=Alan |edition= 4th |location=Oxford, United Kingdom |oclc=933606971}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|168}} Theorists associated with the school include [[Barry Buzan]], [[Ole Wæver]] and [[Jaap de Wilde]]. Many of the school's members worked at the [[Copenhagen Peace Research Institute]]. A prominent critic of the Copenhagen School is Bill McSweeney.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Identity and Security: Buzan and the Copenhagen School|last = McSweeney|first = Bill|date = 1996|journal = Review of International Studies|doi = 10.1017/S0260210500118467|pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The primary book of the Copenhagen School is ''[[Security: A New Framework for Analysis]]'', written by Buzan, Wæver and de Wilde.&lt;ref name="Framework"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Buzan|first1=Barry|last2=Wæver|first2=Ole|last3=de Wilde|first3=Jaap|title=[[Security: A New Framework for Analysis]]|date=1998|publisher=Lynne Rienner Pub.|location=Boulder, Colo.|isbn=978-1-55587-603-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
[[Bill McSweeney]] is generally credited with coining the term 'Copenhagen School'.{{r|Collins|p=87}}

== Sectors ==
{{further|Societal security|Political security|Environmental security|Military security|Economic security}}
The concept of 'sectors' concerns the different arenas where we speak of security. The list of sectors is primarily an analytical tool created to spot different dynamics. In ''[[Security: A New Framework for Analysis]]'', the authors list the following sectors: military/state, political, societal, economic and environmental.&lt;ref name="Framework" /&gt; As such, CS theory can be regarded as 'widening' traditional [[Materialism|materialist]] security studies by looking at security in these 'new' sectors.&lt;ref name="Framework" /&gt;

== Regional security ==
{{main|Regional Security Complex Theory}}

The concept of regional security complexes covers how security is clustered in geographically shaped regions.&lt;ref name="BW03"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Buzan|first1=Barry|last2=Wæver|first2=Ole|title=Regions and Powers: The Structure of International Security|date=2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-89111-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|41}} Security concerns do not travel well over distances and threats are therefore most likely to occur in the region. The security of each actor in a region interacts with the security of the other actors. There is often intense security interdependence within a region, but not between regions, which is what defines a region and what makes regional security an interesting area of study. Insulator states sometimes isolate regions, such as Afghanistan's location between the Middle East and South Asia. Insulators mark boundaries of indifference, where security dynamics stand back to back. They contrast with the traditional idea of 'buffer states' which are located at points where security dynamics are intense (e.g. Belgium between Germany and France). Regions should be regarded as mini systems where all other IR theories can be applied, such as [[Balance of power in international relations|Balance of Power]], polarity, interdependence, alliance systems, etc.{{r|BW03|p=49}}

[[Regional Security Complex Theory]] should not be confused with [[Regionalism (international relations)|Regionalism]], a subset of IR from the 1970s concerned mostly with regional integration.

== Securitization ==

{{main|Securitization (international relations)}}

{{citation needed span|''Securitization'', developed by [[Ole Wæver]], is probably the most prominent concept of the Copenhagen School|date=October 2014}}, and the one that has generated the most literature. It is argued that 'security' is a [[speech act]] with distinct consequences in the context over international politics. {{By whom|date=October 2014}} By talking security an actor tries to move a topic away from politics and into an area of security concerns thereby legitimating extraordinary means against the socially constructed threat. {{citation needed span|The process of securitization is [[intersubjective]] meaning that it is neither a question of an objective threat or a subjective perception of a threat.|date=October 2014}} Instead securitization of a subject depends on an audience accepting a securitization move, undertaken by the securitizing actor.&lt;ref&gt;Buzan, Barry; Wæver, Ole; de Wilde, Jaap (1998). Security: A New Framework for Analysis. Boulder, Colo.: Lynne Rienner Pub. {{ISBN|978-1-55587-603-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the most detailed books on the subject are:
*Understanding Global Security, Peter Hough,Routledge, 2004
*Barry Buzan, People, States and Fear, ECPR, 2007
*The Empire of Security, William Bain, Routledge, 2006

==Criticism==
A criticism that has been advanced against the Copenhagen School is that it is a [[Eurocentrism|eurocentric]] approach to security. 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wilkinson|first1=Claire|title=The Copenhagen School on Tour in Kyrgyzstan: Is Securitization Theory Useable (sic) Outside Europe?|journal=Security Dialogue|date=March 2007|volume=38|issue=1|pages=5–25|doi=10.1177/0967010607075964|url=http://sdi.sagepub.com/content/38/1/5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Realists have also argued that the Copenhagen School's widening of the security agenda risks giving the discipline of [[security studies]] "intellectual incoherence".&lt;ref name="Framework" /&gt; [[Lene Hansen]] has criticized the absence of gender in the Copenhagen School's approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hansen|first1=Lene|title=The Little Mermaid's Silent Security Dilemma and the Absence of Gender in the Copenhagen School|journal=Journal of International Studies|date=June 2000|volume=29|issue=2|pages=285–306|doi=10.1177/03058298000290020501|url=http://mil.sagepub.com/content/29/2/285.full.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other critiques focus on the role of the security analyst and the potentially conservative nature of the theory.&lt;ref&gt;See  Huysmans, ‘Revisiting Copenhagen’; Johan Eriksson, ‘Observers or Advocates?: On the Political Role of Security Analysts’, Cooperation and Conflict 34, no. 3 (1999): 311-3; and Giovanni Arcudi, ‘La Sécurité Entre Permanence et Changement’, Relations Internationales, no. 125 (2006): 97-109&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2535">'''Dhati''' (Persian:ذاتی) -or essential affairs-is a prevalent conception in [[Islamic philosophy]].essential or Dhati attributes are those properties which originated from the thing and its essence. This attributes could separate one thing from other things.&lt;ref name="cgie"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cgie.org.ir/fa/publication/entryview/17293|publisher=cgie.org.ir|title=دائرة المعارف بزرگ اسلامی:آثار ذاتی|accessdate=2017-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==concept==
Dhati or something which is essential for a thing, applied in Islamic philosophy in opposition to [[Accidental property]].those things which are Dhati, are definite description for separation of one thing from other things. Dhati in Islamic philosophy has three uses:
*Dhati in opposition to Accidental or [[Aradhi]]
* existential phenomena in opposition to essential phenomena
*celestial phenomena versus sublunary phenomena&lt;ref name="cgie"/&gt;
this term also used as description for apprehension,&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=Self-Awareness in Islamic Philosophy|author=Kaukua, J.|date=2014|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781107088795|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=rZmiBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA53|page=53|accessdate=2017-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; creation.&lt;ref name="google2"&gt;{{cite book|title=Timing and Temporality in Islamic Philosophy and Phenomenology of Life|author=Tymieniecka, A.T.|date=2007|publisher=Springer Netherlands|isbn=9781402061608|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=y4rzvzNcSzUC&amp;pg=PA164|page=164|accessdate=2017-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; essential attribute is such that the described thing is along with it and is not outside of substance.&lt;ref name="google3"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Heart of Islamic Philosophy: The Quest for Self-Knowledge in the Teachings of Afdal al-Din Kashani|author=Chittick, W.C.|date=2001|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780198031864|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=TE8rCwtwPVwC&amp;pg=PA295|page=295|accessdate=2017-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dhati in philosophical usage==
according to [[Avicenna]], essential phenomena are to those predicates maintain their subjects. if the essential phenomena disappeared then the essence would be demolished. These phenomena are such a way that the subject is dependent to them in its existence. some times Muslim philosophers  used essential phenomena as requisites of quiddities. these requisites predicates on quiddities as such, not in respect to their existence.

'''Donald Allen Crosby''' (born 7 April 1932) is Professor Emeritus of Philosophy at Colorado State University, since January 2000. Crosby's interests focus on metaphysics, American pragmatism, philosophy of nature, existentialism, and philosophy of religion. He is a member of the Highlands Institute of American Religious and Philosophical Thought (HAIRPT)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hiarpt.org/ Highlands Institute of American Religious and Philosophical Thought]&lt;/ref&gt; and has been a leader in the discussions on [[Religious Naturalism]].

==Biography==
Crosby is a [[Religious Naturalist]] having contributed to the movement with six books and a number of journal articles and chapters in books. He argues that nature itself, without notions of God, gods, animating spirits, or supernatural beings or realms of any kind, is both metaphysically and religiously ultimate, and thus an appropriate and compelling focus of religious commitment and concern. Nature as a whole can be considered sacred. This is so despite the radical ambiguities of nature, or its intricate mixtures of goods and evils, to which he calls sustained attention in his 2008 book ''Living with Ambiguity: Religious Naturalism and the Menace of Evil''.

He was born in Mansfield, Ohio, and grew up in Pensacola, Florida. He attended Davidson College in North Carolina and trained for the Presbyterian ministry at Princeton Theological Seminary. He was minister of a Presbyterian church in Christiana, Delaware, for three years and decided after that time to study for a doctorate in religion, with emphasis on philosophy of religion and ethics, in the joint program in religion at Union Theological Seminary and Columbia University in New York City. During the first two years of his doctoral work he served as part-time assistant minister at the First Congregational Church on the Green in Norwalk, Connecticut. Following upon his doctoral studies, he became an assistant professor of philosophy and religion at Centre College in Danville, Kentucky. In the fall of 1965 he began teaching religious studies and philosophy in the philosophy department at Colorado State University, from which he retired as Emeritus Professor of Philosophy in 2001.

Crosby demitted the Presbyterian ministry in 1969 and began to develop his version of religious naturalism in writings dating from the early 1990s, reaching fuller expression in ''A Religion of Nature'' in 2002, and continuing to the present. Impetus for this process of development also dates from the writing of his book on philosophical nihilism, ''The Specter of the Absurd'', published in 1988 and from his study of, and constructive work on, theories of religion in ''Interpretive Theories of Religion'', published in 1981. The writing of his doctoral dissertation on [[Horace Bushnell’s]] theory of language, published in 1975 as ''Horace Bushnell’s Theory of Language in the Context of Other Nineteenth Century Philosophies of Language'', contributed greatly to the freeing of his mind from any vestiges of biblical or theological literalism, as did his studies of the origins and characters of the Hebrew and Christian scriptures at Princeton.

In addition, Crosby’s exposure to the field of world religions at Columbia helped to broaden his thought far beyond its earlier religious conservatism. The ''[[God is Dead]]'' movement in the 1960s, and especially its reflections on theological implications of the atrocities of the Nazi regime and the carnage of World War II, had an important influence on his abandonment of traditional theism. Finally, teaching courses on the philosophy of religion and on various philosophical systems in a secular university challenged him constantly to reflect on the relevance of religious and philosophical thought for his time and to continue to work out his own religious and philosophical outlook. He has been strongly influenced by the thought of [[William James]], [[John Dewey]], [[Alfred North Whitehead]], and [[Paul Tillich]] in doing so, but other great philosophical and religious thinkers of the Western tradition have made their decisive contributions to his outlook as well, as have important writers about Eastern ways of thinking and living. Still another major influence on Crosby’s outlook is the findings of contemporary science, especially in the fields of cosmology, evolutionary biology, and ecology.

Crosby summarizes much of his current mode of religious and philosophical thought with four “Ps”: [[Religious pluralism|pluralism]], [[perspectivism]], processism, and [[pragmatism]]. Discussion of the natures and interrelations of these four themes in his philosophy is presented, among other places, in his 2005 book ''Novelty'' and in the book ''Living with Ambiguity''. To these four major themes typifying Crosby’s philosophical and religious outlook should be added the theme of his religious and philosophical naturalism. A sixth basic theme, also developed in his book ''Novelty'', is the theme of emergentism, especially the [[emergence]] of life from non-life and of conscious life from organic life in general. A final important theme brought to the fore in this book is his defense of [[indeterminism]] and freedom. This theme is given further development in his books "Nature as Sacred Ground" and "Consciousness and Freedom." All these themes have far-reaching consequences for philosophy of nature and a religious naturalism.

The individual perspectives on Religious Naturalism of [[Loyal Rue]], [[Jerome A. Stone]], [[Ursula Goodenough]] and Crosby are discussed by Michael Hogue in his 2010 book'' The Promise of Religious Naturalism''.&lt;ref&gt;The Promise of Religious Naturalism - Michael Hogue, Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers, Inc., Sept.16, 2010, {{ISBN|0-7425-6261-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''FreeWRL''' is an [[open-source software|open-source]] compliant [[VRML]]/[[X3D]] [[Web browser|browser]] for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[Linux]] and [[Mac OS X]].

==History==
FreeWRL was originally developed by Tuomas Lukka in 1998. Also in 1998, [http://www.canarie.ca Canarie] funded a project titled "Distributed Interactive Virtual Environment (DIVE) over CA*net II", with three partners, the universities of
[https://www.uottawa.ca Ottawa] and [http://www.uwo.ca Western Ontario], and
[http://www.crc.ca CRC Canada]. FreeWRL was used by CRC in this project, as it ran on their platform of choice, Linux, and supported VRML additions (the EAI protocol) that allowed control of a VRML scene from outside entities.

At the end of the DIVE project, CRC took the knowledge gained from it, and combined this knowledge with other on-going projects (European Commission funded projects of Meccano, MERCI and MICE [http://www-mice.cs.ucl.ac.uk/multimedia/projects/]) and created a form of conferencing by designing a distributed multicast enabled virtual world with position-dependent audio capabilities. This project, MVIP [http://mvip.sourceforge.net], and the follow on, MVIP-II [http://mvip.sourceforge.net], leveraged VRML and Multicast to enable interaction in shared worlds where participants were physically distant, by removing both high bitrate applications (video) and  "time sinks" (client-server interaction) to best give the participants the feeling of being in a shared space.

MVIP and MVIP source is available [http://mvip.sourceforge.net], and papers describing MVIP can be found on acm.org [http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=330160.330194 here] and
[http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=636617 here].

MVIP-II tests were conducted between Ottawa, Canada, and Denmark, and between Ottawa, and Hawaii.

CRC, with the valued support of Open Source contributors, continued to develop FreeWRL during the MVIP and MVIP-II projects. CRC co-sponsored the Web3D Consortium's
Software Development Kit, and chaired the Web3D Consortium's Conformance Working Group, giving both industry and the public a common set of functionality to strive for.

As of the 2007-2008 timeframe, CRC was researching better ways of bridging audio, physical interfaces, and 3D visuals. To this end, FreeWRL now interfaces with [[MIDI]]
devices on both [[Linux]] and [[Mac OS X]]; and with Propellerheads [[Reason (program)|Reason]].

FreeWRL has been developed by Open Source contributors, and managed by John Stewart, [http://www.crc.ca/ CRC Canada]. It is believed to be the first sanctioned Open Source project
supported by the Federal Government of Canada, and gave CRC considerable in-depth knowledge on this and related technologies, in accordance with CRC's mandate. In April 2010 CRC cancelled its financial and official support of the project. The participants and project continued to thrive and in mid-2011 the list of ongoing improvements included smart phone and GPU initiatives.

FreeWRL follows the [http://www.web3d.org/ Web3D Consortium's] ISO standards, and is certified "Interchange Profile" Compliant by the Web3D Consortium.
It is in daily use worldwide. It is multi-threaded, written in C, and uses OpenGL for rendering. Source code is available [http://freewrl.sourceforge.net]. Development of FreeWRL has been continuous,
and is expected to continue, with focus on interactivity, usability, and rendering fidelity. As with most Open Source projects, help with code development and testing is
always welcome.

'''Friedrich Karl Forberg''' (30 August 1770, [[Meuselwitz]] – 1 January 1848, [[Hildburghausen]]) was a German philosopher and classical scholar.

== Biography ==
[[File:Forberg PdT ret.jpg|thumb|''Hermaphroditus'' (1824), title page.]]
[[File:Édouard-Henri Avril (28).jpg|thumb|Plate XVII by [[Édouard-Henri Avril]] for an edition of Forberg's ''De Figuris Veneris'']]
He studied under [[Karl Leonhard Reinhold]] at [[Jena]]. In 1791 he travelled to [[Klagenfurt]], writing to Reinhold that there was much sympathy for the [[French Revolution]], and to the followers of [[Immanuel Kant]] that the young ladies of Klagenfurt substituted Kant's writings (modestly bound in black) for their prayer books.

He was a headmaster at [[Saalfeld/Saale]], and from 1801 to 1826 Director of the Sächsische Landesbibliothek. His philosophical publications are less known now than his 1824 edition of an erotic poem sequence in renaissance Latin, ''Hermaphroditus'' by [[Antonio Beccadelli (poet)|Antonio Beccadelli]]. This was accompanied by Forberg's own learned commentary, which took the form of a catalogue and anthology of descriptions of sexual acts and postures in classical and later literature.

Forberg's journal article regarding religion and its effect on morality initiated the [[Atheism Dispute]] which resulted in [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]]'s dismissal from his professorship.

'''Idea art''', is an [[art]] form in which small individual [[idea]](s) and not the grand [[concept]](s) or ideologies involved in the work take precedence over generic [[Aesthetics|aesthetic]], material and disciplinary concerns.
Works of idea art may be in text, [[found object]], 2d, 3d, moving images, sound, performance, digital, interactive media and/ or as installations. This method was fundamental to Turkish artist [[Genco Gulan]]'s definition of idea art, one of the first to appear online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.openspaceistanbul.co.uk/genco-gulan/|title=Idea art definition by Genco Gulan| archivedate=June 2016|publisher=Open Space}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In idea art the idea is the most important aspect of the art work. It may be start a project and/ or maybe attached to it later, after he or she finishes the production. In this way, the artist not only works like and [[architect]] or an engineer, as in the case of [[conceptual art]] but also works like a [[curator]] and/ or an art writer.

Idea art should not be confused with idealism or in other words, perfectualism. Individual ideas for art should not be perfect or beautiful but appropriate.

'''James Wallace Heisig''' (born 1944)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mit.worldcat.org/identities/lccn-n78034915/ |title=Heisig, James W. 1944– |publisher=[[WorldCat]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a philosopher who specialises in the field of [[philosophy of religion]]. He has published a number of books on topics ranging from the notion of God in [[analytical psychology]], the [[Kyoto School]] of Philosophy (including the works of [[Nishida Kitaro]] and [[Tanabe Hajime]]) to contemporary inter-religious dialogue. His books, translations, and edited collections, which have appeared in 12 languages, currently number 78 volumes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nirc.nanzan-u.ac.jp/en/staff/jheisig/ |title= Nanzan Institute for Religion and Culture's faculty page}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He served as a lecturer at the [[Divine Word College]] (Epworth, Iowa) as a BA student and graduated with a BA degree in Philosophy from the same college in 1966. Then he received his master's degree in philosophy from [[Loyola University Chicago]] and another master's degree in Notre Dame University at the same time in 1969. After receiving a PhD in Religious studies at [[Cambridge University]] in 1973, he went back to Divine Word College to teach philosophy and religion as a lecturer. Between 1974 and 1978, he was a visiting lecturer at [[Catholic Theological Union]], [[Instituto Superior de Studios Eclesiásticos]] (Mexico City) and [[Old Dominion University]] (Norfolk, Virginia). In September 1978, he moved to Japan (first in [[Nagano Prefecture|Nagano]] and then to the city of Nagoya in Aichi Prefecture) and thereby became a Permanent Research Fellow at the [[Nanzan Institute for Religion and Culture]] at [[Nanzan University]]. He served as the director of the Nanzan Institute from 1991 to 2001 following in the footsteps of the former director and Belgian philosopher, [[Jan Van Bragt]]. In 2015, Heisig received an honorary doctoral degree from [[Tallinn University]] in Estonia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tlu.ee/en/News/3231/james-heisig-given-honorary-doctoral-degree-at-tu |title= Tallinn University Website}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heisig still resides in [[Nagoya]], where he continues to conduct research at the "Japanese Philosophy Reference Materials" at the Nanzan Institute, publishes a number of books and travels around the world to give his lectures on philosophy and religion. He is also famed among students of the Japanese and Chinese languages for his [[Remembering the Kanji and Remembering the Hanzi|''Remembering the Kanji'' and ''Remembering the Hanzi'']] series.

'''John Barker''' (fl. ca. 1471&amp;ndash;1482) was first recorded as a King's Scholar at [[Eton College]] about 1471. He went to King's College in 1474, was elected a fellow in 1477, and graduated MA in 1479.&lt;ref&gt;So the ''DNB'' and ''ODNB''. The original edition of Venn distinguished two men of the same name: {{acad|id=BRKR4..J|name=Barker, John}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His Etonian connection may indicate that he was from the south of England.

Barker taught logic to "sophisters" (second-year undergraduates) using his own text, the ''[[Scutum inexpugnabile]]''. No copy survives, but it was probably an introduction to [[Aristotle|Aristotelian]] [[logic]] and [[modal grammar]]. [[Brian Rowe]], who came up to King's in 1499, wrote a commendatory preface for it in the early 16th century, indicating that it was then still in use in the college. Barker left King's in 1482, approximately the year [[John Fisher]] and [[John Colet]] came to Cambridge, and later joined the Franciscans. The date and place of his death are unknown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Leader|first=Damian R.|title=Barker, John (fl. c.1471–1482), logician|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/1401?docPos=1|work=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=31 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''José Vasconcelos Calderón''' (28 February 1882 – 30 June 1959) has been called the "cultural {{lang|es|[[caudillo]]}}" of the [[Mexican Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;Krauze, ''Redeemers''; chapter 3 is subtitled "José Vasconcelos, the Cultural Caudillo"&lt;/ref&gt; He was an important  [[Mexico|Mexican]] writer, philosopher and politician.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=José Vasconcelos |url= http://www.biografiasyvidas.com/biografia/v/vasconcelos.htm |work=Biografías y Vidas: La enciclopedia biográfica en línea}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is one of the most influential and controversial personalities in the development of modern Mexico. His philosophy of the "'''[[La Raza|cosmic race]]'''" affected all aspects of Mexican sociocultural, political, and economic policies.

==Personal life, education, and career==
José Vasconcelos was born in [[Oaxaca, Oaxaca]] on February 28, 1882, the son of a customs official.&lt;ref&gt;Krauze, ''Redeemers''; p. 53&lt;/ref&gt; José's mother, who was a pious Catholic, died when José was sixteen. The family moved to the border town of [[Piedras Negras, Coahuila]], where he grew up attending school in [[Eagle Pass, Texas]].&lt;ref&gt;Krauze, ''Redeemers'', p. 53&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; He became bilingual in English and Spanish,&lt;ref&gt;Krauze, ''Redeemers'', p. 53&lt;/ref&gt; which opened doors to the English-speaking world. The family also lived in [[Campeche]] during a period when the northern border area was unstable. His time in living on the Texas border likely contributed to fostering his idea of the Mexican "'''cosmic race'''" and rejection of Anglo culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Margarita |last=Vera Cuspinera |chapter=José Vasconcelos |title=Encyclopedia of Mexico |location=Chicago |publisher=Fitzroy Dearborn |date=1997 |page=1519}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He married Serafina Miranda of [[Tlaxiaco]] in the [[Oaxaca|state of Oaxaca]] in 1906, when he was twenty-four. With her he had children José Ignacio and Carmen. He also had a long-term relationship with [[Elena Arizmendi Mejia]] and through life, many other shorter liaisons, including one with [[Berta Singerman]].&lt;ref&gt;Krauze, ''Redeemers'', pp. 55, 67.&lt;/ref&gt; His troubled relationship with [[Antonieta Rivas Mercado]] led to her suicide inside Paris' Notre Dame Cathedral in 1931. When his wife of forty years died in 1942, their daughter Carmen is reported saying "When the coffin was lowered into the ground, Vasconcelos sobbed bitterly. At that moment he must have known and felt who he really had as a wife; perhaps they were tears of belated repentance."&lt;ref&gt;quoted in Krauze, ''Redeemers'', p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt; He remarried pianist [[Esperanza Cruz]] and they had a child, Héctor.&lt;ref&gt;Krauze, ''Redeemers'', p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Participation in the Mexican Revolution===
Although Vasconcelos was interested in studying philosophy, Mexican universities during the Porfiriato focused on the sciences, influenced by French [[positivism]]. Vasconcelos attended the [[National Preparatory School]] in Mexico City, an elite high school, going on to Escuela de Jurisprudencia in [[Mexico City]] (1905). In law school, he became involved with radical students organized as the ''Ateneo de la Juventud'' (Youth Atheneum).&lt;ref name="Vera Cuspinera 1519"&gt;Vera Cuspinera, "José Vasconcelos", p. 1519.&lt;/ref&gt; The Ateneo de Juventud was led by a Dominican citizen, [[Pedro Henríquez Ureña]], who had read Uruguayan essayist [[José Enrique Rodó]]'s ''Ariel'', an influential work published in 1900 that was opposed to Anglo U.S. cultural influence, but also emphasized the redemptive power of education.&lt;ref&gt;Krauze, ''Redeemers'', p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; The Anteneo de la Juventud had a diverse membership, composed of university professors, artists, other professionals, and students. Some other members included [[Isidro Fabela]] and [[Diego Rivera]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=John Mason |last=Hart |title=Revolutionary Mexico: The Coming and Process of the Mexican Revolution |location=Berkeley and Los Angeles |publisher=[[University of California Press]] |date=1987 |page=95}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was opposed to the Díaz regime and formulated arguments against it and the regime's emphasis on positivism by employing French spiritualism, which articulated "a new vision of the relationship between individual and society."&lt;ref name="Vera Cuspinera 1519"/&gt;

After graduating from law school, he joined a law firm of Warner, John, and Galston in Washington, D.C. Vasconcelos joined the local Anti-Reelection Club in [[Washington, D.C.]].&lt;ref name="Vera Cuspinera 1519"/&gt; The Anti-Reelectionistas supported the democratic movement to oust long-time President of Mexico [[Porfirio Díaz]] 1910, and headed by [[Francisco I. Madero]], the presidential candidate of the Anti-Re-electionista Party. Vasconcelos returned to Mexico City to participate more directly in the anti-reelectionist movement, becoming one of the party's secretaries and editing its newspaper, ''El Antireelectionista''.&lt;ref name="Vera Cuspinera 1519"/&gt;

After Díaz was ousted by revolutionary violence followed by the election of Madero as elected president of Mexico, Vasconcelos led a structural change at the [[National Preparatory School]], where he changed the academic programs, breaking with the [[positivistic]] influence of the past.

After Madero's assassination in February 1913, Vasconcelos joined the broad based movement to defeat the military regime of [[Victoriano Huerta]]. Soon after, Vasconcelos was forced into exile in [[Paris]], where he met [[Julio Torri]], [[Doctor Atl]], [[Gabriele D'Annunzio]], and other intellectuals and artists of the time. After Huerta was ousted in July 1914, Vasconcelos returned to Mexico.

The [[Convention of Aguascalientes]] in 1914, the failed attempt of the factions that defeated the Huerta regime to find a political solution, but which split the factions. Leader of the Constitutionalists, [[Venustiano Carranza]] and General [[Álvaro Obregón]] split with more radical revolutionaries, especially [[Pancho Villa]] and [[Emiliano Zapata]].  Vasconcelos chose the side of the Convention and served as Minister of Education during the brief presidential period of [[Eulalio Gutiérrez]]. Pancho Villa was defeated by the Constitutionalist Army under Obregón in the [[Battle of Celaya]] in 1915 and Vasconcelos went into exile again. [[Venustiano Carranza]] became president of Mexico (1915–1920), but was ousted and killed by the Sonoran generals that had helped put him in power.

===Rector of the National University===
Vasconcelos returned to Mexico during the interim presidency of Sonoran [[Adolfo de la Huerta]] was named rector the [[National Autonomous University of Mexico]] (1920)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |work=Texas Archival Resources Online |title=José Vasconcelos |url=http://www.lib.utexas.edu/taro/utlac/00061/lac-00061.html |publisher=University of Texas Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Krauze, ''Redeemers'', p. 61&lt;/ref&gt; As rector, he had a great deal of power, but he accrued even more by ignoring the standard structures, such as the University Council, to govern the institution.&lt;ref&gt;Krauze, ''Redeemers'', p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; Rather, he exercised personalist power, and began implementing his vision of the function of the university. He redesigned the logo of the university to show a map of Latin America, with the phrase "Por mi raza hablará el espíritu" (The spirit will speak for my race), an influence of Rodó's ''arielismo''.&lt;ref&gt;Krauze, ''Redeemers'', p. 62&lt;/ref&gt; An eagle and a condor with a background of the volcanic mountains in central Mexico. Vasconcelos is said to have declared "I have not come to govern the University but to ask the University to work for the people."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Krauze, ''Redeemers'', p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Escudo-UNAM-escalable.svg|thumbnail|right|Logo of the [[National University of Mexico]] designed by Vasconcelos when he was rector]]

===Secretary of Public Education===
When Álvaro Obregón became president in 1920, he created the [[Secretariat of Public Education]] (SEP) in 1921 and named Vasconcelos as its head.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=José Vasconcelos |work=Encyclopaedia Britannica |edition=online |url= http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/623688/Jose-Vasconcelos}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under Obregón, the national budget had two key expeditures; not surprisingly the military was first, but the second was education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=John W. F. |last=Dulles |title=Yesterday in Mexico: A Chronicle of the Revolution, 1919-1936 |location=Austin |publisher=[[University of Texas Press]] |date=1961 |page=118}}&lt;/ref&gt; Creating the Secretariat entailed changing the [[Constitution of 1917]], and in order to do that, Obregón's government had to muster support from lawmakers.  Vasconcelos traveled through Mexico while he was rector of the university seeking that support. The effort succeeded and Vasconcelos was named head of the new cabinet level secretariat in July 1921.&lt;ref&gt;Dulles, ''Yesterday in Mexico'', p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt;

During his tenure at SEP he was in a powerful position to implement the vision of Mexico's history, especially the Mexican Revolution.

He printed huge numbers of texts for the expanded public school system, but in the 1920s there was no agreement about how the Mexican Revolution should be portrayed, so earlier history texts by [[Justo Sierra]], who headed the ministry of public education in the government of [[Porfirio Díaz]] continued to be used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Thomas |last=Benjamin |title=''La Revolución'': Mexico's Great Revolution as Memory, Myth, and History |location=Austin |publisher=University of Texas Press |date=2000 |page=141}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although he was no advocate of Mexican indigenous culture, as Secretary of Education he sent Brazil a statue of the last Aztec emperor [[Cuauhtemoc]] for their centennial celebrations of independence in 1923, to disdain and puzzlement of the South American recipients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Paul |last=Gillingham |title=Cuauhtémoc's Bones: Forging National Identity in Modern Mexico |location=Albuquerque |publisher=[[University of New Mexico Press]] |date=2011 |page=173}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Political Opposition===
He resigned in 1924 because of his opposition to President [[Plutarco Elías Calles]]. He worked in favor of the education of the masses and sought to make the nation's education secular, civic, and Pan-American (''americanista'') lines. He ran for [[President of Mexico|president]] in 1929 but lost to [[Pascual Ortiz Rubio]] in a controversial election and again left the country.

He later directed the [[National Library of Mexico]] (1940) and presided over the Mexican Institute of Hispanic Culture (1948).

==Philosophical thought==
Vasconcelos' first writings on philosophy are passionate reactions against the formal, [[Positivism|positivistic]] education at the National Preparatory School, formerly under the influence of [[Porfirio Díaz|porfirian]] thinkers like [[Justo Sierra]] and [[Gabino Barreda]].

A second period of productivity was fed by a first disappointment in the political field, after Madero's murder. Then he wrote, in 1919, a long essay on [[Pythagoras|Pythagorism]], as a dissertation on the links between [[harmony]] and [[rhythm]], and its eventual explanation into a frame of [[Aesthetics|aesthetic]] [[monism]]. As he argued that only by the means of rhythm is the human being able to know the world without any intermediation, he proposed that the minimal aspects of cognition are conditioned by a degree of sympathy with the natural "vibration" of things. In this manner, he thought that the auditive categories of knowledge were much higher than the visual ones.

During a later period, Vasconcelos developed an argument for the mixing of races, as a natural and desirable direction for humankind. This work, known as {{lang|es|[[La raza cósmica]]}} ('The Cosmic Race'), would eventually contribute to further studies on ethnic values as an [[Ethics|ethic]], and for the consideration of ethnic variety as an aesthetic source. Finally, between 1931 and 1940 he tried to consolidate his proposals by publishing his main topics organized in three main works: {{lang|es|Metafísica}} ('[[Metaphysics]]'), {{lang|es|Ética}} ('Ethics'), and {{lang|es|Estética}} ('[[Aesthetics]]').

In the final part of his life, he gradually fell into a deeply Catholic political conservatism. Before the Second World War, he began writing sympathetically about Franco, and he retracted some of his earlier liberal positions. One of his last published works, Letanías del atardecer (1957) is a pessimistic tract hinting that the use of nuclear weapons might be necessary given the post-war order.

==Influence==
[[File:Jose Vasconcelos Jose Urquidi Rafael Zubiran Peredo.jpg|right|thumb|250 px|José Vasconcelos (left) with José Urquidi, [[Rafael Zubarán Capmany]] and Peredo.]]

Vasconcelos is often referred to as the father of the "{{lang|es|indigenismo}}" philosophy. In recent times, this philosophy has come under criticism from Native Americans because of its negative implications concerning indigenous peoples. To an extent, his philosophy argued for a new, "modern" mestizo people, but at the cost of cultural assimilation of all ethnic groups. His research on the nature of Mexican modern identity had a direct influence on the young writers, poets, anthropologists and philosophers who wrote on this subject. He also influenced the point of view of [[Carlos Pellicer]] with respect to several aesthetic assumptions reflected in his books. Together, Pellicer and Vasconcelos made a trip through the [[Middle East]] (1928–29), looking for the "spiritual basis" of [[Byzantium|Byzantine]] architecture.

Other works, particularly {{lang|es|[[La raza cósmica]]}} and {{lang|es|Metafísica}}, had a decisive influence in [[Octavio Paz]]'s {{lang|es|[[El laberinto de la soledad]]}} ('The Labyrinth of Solitude'), with [[Cultural anthropology|anthropological]] and aesthetic implications. Paz wrote that Vasconcelos was "the teacher" who had educated hundreds of young [[Latin America]]n intellectuals during his many trips to [[Central America|Central]] and [[South America]]. Vasconcelos was guest lecturer at [[Columbia University]] and [[Princeton University]], but his influence on new generations in the United States became gradually less significant. Nevertheless, his work {{lang|es|La raza cósmica}} has been used by [[Chicano]] and [[Mexican-American]] movements since the 1970s, asserting the {{lang|es|[[reconquista]]}} ('retaking' or literally 'reconquest') of the [[American Southwest]], based on their Mexican ancestry.

==Contributions to the arts and education==
Thanks to Vasconcelos, the National Symphonic Orchestra (1920) and the Symphonic Orchestra of Mexico (1928) were officially endorsed. [[Muralism|Muralists]] [[Diego Rivera]], [[José Clemente Orozco]], and [[David Alfaro Siqueiros]] were given the right to paint the inner walls of the most important public buildings in Mexico (e.g., the [[National Palace (Mexico)|National Palace]] in [[Mexico City]]), creating the [[Mexican murals|Mexican mural]] movement.

==Quotations==
"[T]he leaders of Latin American independence ... strove to free the slaves, declared the equality of all men by natural law; the social and civic equality of whites, blacks and Indians. In an instant of historical crisis, they formulated the transcendental mission assigned to that region of the Globe: the mission of fusing the peoples ethnically and spiritually."  ({{lang|es|La raza cósmica}}, 1948)

"Each of the great nations of History has believed itself to be the final and chosen one. ... The Hebrews founded the belief in their superiority on oracles and divine promises. The English found theirs on observations relative to domestic animals. From the observation of cross-breeding and hereditary varieties in such animals, Darwinism emerged. First, as a modest zoological theory, then as social biology that confers definitive preponderance to the English above all races. Every imperialism needs a justifying philosophy". ({{lang|es|La raza cósmica}}, 1948)

"Hitler, although he disposes of absolute power, finds himself a thousand leagues from Caesarism. Power does not come to Hitler from the military base, but from the book that inspires the troops from the top.  Hitler's power is not owed to the troops, nor the battalions, but to his own discussions... Hitler represents, ultimately, an idea, the German idea, so often humiliated previously by French militarism and English perfidy. Truthfully, we find civilian governed 'democracies' fighting against Hitler. But they are democracies in name only". ("{{lang|es|italics=no|La Inteligencia se impone}}", ''Timon'' 16; June 8, 1940)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1504">'''Józef Supiński''' (village of Romanów, near [[Lwów]], 21 February 1804 – 16 February 1893, [[Lwów]]) was a [[Poland|Polish]] [[philosopher]], [[jurist]], economist and [[sociologist]].

==Life==
A student at [[Warsaw University]], Supiński in 1831 left for Paris, because he had participated in the [[November Uprising|November 1830 Uprising]] and feared repressions by the Russian authorities. In France, he worked as a factory manager. In 1844 he returned to Poland, settling in Lwów, where he remained until his death.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ieF7NYaEqQYC&amp;pg=PA130 Polish liberal thought before 1918 By Maciej Janowski, page 130]&lt;/ref&gt;

Supiński coined the expression "''praca organiczna''" ("organic work"), which was the foundation of [[Positivism in Poland|Polish Positivism]] in the latter 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=tlKbYdjLZ0wC&amp;pg=PA101 History derailed By Tibor Iván Berend, page 101]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="70044">{{Latin grammar|sidebar}}
The word order of classical Latin is relatively free. Subject, Object, and Verb can come in any order; adjectives and possessives can go before or after their noun, and so on. A commonly found feature of Latin is [[hyperbaton]], in which a phrase is split up by other words, e.g. ''Sextus est Tarquinius'' "it is Sextus Tarquinius".

A complicating factor in '''Latin word order''' is that there are variations between the style of different authors, and also between different genres of writing; in Caesar's historical writing the verb is much more likely to come at the end of the sentence than in Cicero's philosophy. The word order of poetry is even freer than prose, and examples of interleaved word order (double hyperbaton) are common.

In terms of [[word order]] typology, Latin is classified by some scholars as basically an SOV (Subject-Object-Verb) language, with Preposition-Noun, Noun-Genitive, and Adjective-Noun (but also Noun-Adjective) order. Others, however, argue that the word order of Latin is so variable that it is impossible to establish one order as more basic than another.

As will be seen in the examples below, the order of words in Latin is not random, but frequently indicates different nuances of meaning and emphasis. As the authors of ''Latin Word Order'', Devine and Stephens, put it: "Word order is not a subject which anyone reading Latin can afford to ignore. ... Reading a paragraph of Latin without attention to word order entails losing access to a whole dimension of meaning."&lt;ref&gt;D&amp;S, preface.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Word order and meaning==
One important advantage of studying word order in Latin is that it helps the reader to understand the author's meaning more clearly. Thus for example ''complosit Trimalchio manus'' doesn't merely mean "Trimalchio clapped his hands", but the initial verb implies a sudden action: "Trimalchio suddenly clapped his hands". In another sentence the initial verb functions as a topic: ''decessit Corellius Rufus'' doesn't mean "Corellius Rufus has died" but rather "The person who has died is Corellius Rufus."&lt;ref&gt;Sturtevant (1909), pp. 26–7.&lt;/ref&gt; In another sentence, the initial verb is emphatic: ''vidi forum'' doesn't simply mean "I saw the forum", but "with my own eyes I saw the forum".

The placement of adjectives also affects the emphasis. Thus ''mea fama'', with the possessive before the noun, means not "my fame" but "my ''own'' fame"; ''naves sunt combustae quinque'', with the number at the end of the sentence and separated from its noun, doesn't just mean "five ships were burnt" but "no fewer than five ships were burnt".

The use of [[hyperbaton]] (separation of words which normally go together) is also worth observing. Thus Caesar's ''hae permanserunt aquae dies complures'', with ''hae'' separated from ''aquae'' and ''complures'' at the end of the sentence, doesn't mean "These floods remained for several days" but "This time the flood waters, unlike the previous ones, remained for several days".

==Theoretical approaches==
In the past hundred years, but especially since the advent of computerised texts, Latin word order has been extensively studied, with a view to elucidating the principles on which it is based, and establishing what nuances of meaning or emphasis could be obtained by using different word orders. Two major recent works on Latin word order, based on different approaches, are those of Devine and Stephens (2006) and Olga Spevak (2010).

It is generally agreed that pragmatic factors play a major role in Latin word order, that is, factors such as topic and focus, contrast, emphasis, and heaviness. The topic (what is being talked about) often tends to come at the beginning of the sentence, and the focus (what is said about the topic) at the end or in penultimate position.&lt;ref&gt;Spevak (2010), pp. 29–31.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other factors that play a role in word order are semantic (for example, adjectives of size usually precede the noun, those of material more often follow it), and in some Latin authors consideration of such matters as euphony, assonance, and rhythm.

One major area of disagreement is how far syntax plays a role in word order. According to Devine and Stephens (2006), Latin has a basic neutral word order, which they state is as follows:&lt;ref&gt;D&amp;S, p. 79&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Subject (grammar)|Subject]] – Direct [[Object (grammar)|Object]] – Indirect Object / Oblique [[Argument (grammar)|Argument]] – [[Adjunct (grammar)|Adjunct]] – Goal or Source – Non-Referential Direct Object – [[Verb]]

A "non-referential object" is one like ''impetum'' in the phrase ''impetum facere'' ("to make an attack") which goes closely with the verb.

Following the theories of [[generative grammar]], Devine and Stephens assume that deviations from this basic unmarked order are made in order to put emphasis on different elements. They use the term "scrambling" if constituents come in a different order from the basic one, and assume that scrambling occurs when an element is moved leftwards, towards the beginning of the sentence. This leftwards movement is called "raising".&lt;ref&gt;D&amp;S, p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt;

Olga Spevak (2010), on the other hand, basing her work on theories of [[Functional theories of grammar|functional grammar]], rejects this approach. In her view, there are so many deviations from the so-called neutral order not only between authors but even in the works of the same author that it is not possible to discover what the neutral order must be; and therefore an approach which insists on a basic unmarked order "does not really help a Latinist to better understand Latin constituent order".&lt;ref&gt;Spevak (2010), pp. 3–4.&lt;/ref&gt; She stresses that according to the principles of functional grammar, as outlined by the Dutch linguist [[Simon C. Dik|Simon Dik]], words take their positions in a sentence according to a certain template, not by being moved from elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;Spevak (2010), p. 8, footnote 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, not all scholars are ready to dismiss syntactic factors entirely. J.G.F. Powell, in his review of Spevak's book, comments that "nobody has yet succeeded in unifying the insights of all the different scholarly approaches to the fascinating and peculiar problem of Latin word order". In his view an approach which combines the various schools of thought on Latin word order "may succeed in finding a more satisfactory solution".

==Topic and focus==
Several recent books, such as those of Panhuis and Spevak, have analysed Latin sentences from a pragmatic point of view. Syntactic approaches traditionally analyse a sentence into Subject and Predicate, but a pragmatic analysis considers a sentence from the point of view of Topic and Focus (or Theme and Rheme, as Panhuis (1982) puts it). This type of approach was also proposed by Sturtevant (1909), who referred to the topic as the "psychological subject".

As with Subject, Object and Verb, Topic and Focus can be arranged in different ways in a sentence.

===Topic===
====Types of topic====
The topic is the thing or person that is being talked about in the sentence. Spevak (2010) distinguishes various kinds of topic: discourse topic, sentence topic, sub-topic, future topic, theme, and so on. A sentence topic is one that picks up the immediately preceding context (e.g. ''ad ea'' below) and has precedence over the discourse topic (''Caesar'' below):&lt;ref&gt;Spevak (2010), p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt;
:''&lt;u&gt;ad ea&lt;/u&gt; Caesar respondit...''&lt;ref&gt;Caesar, ''B.C.'', 1.85.1&lt;/ref&gt;
:"To this Caesar replied..."

A topic will often take precedence over a conjunction, and the following word order where the topic (in this case the grammatical subject) precedes ''cum'' "when" is fairly common:&lt;ref&gt;Spevak (2010), p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;
:''&lt;u&gt;Tubero&lt;/u&gt;, cum in Africam venisset, invenit in provincia cum imperio Attium Varum.''&lt;ref&gt;Caesar, ''B.C.'' 1.31.2.&lt;/ref&gt;
:"As for Tubero, when he reached Africa, he found Attius Varus in the province with military command."

====Topicless sentences====
Not every sentence has a topic, but some present information which is entirely new. Pinkster gives the following as an example:&lt;ref&gt;Pinkster (1990b), §9.3.2.5.&lt;/ref&gt;
:''erant omnino itinera duo''.&lt;ref&gt;Caesar, ''B.G.'' 1.6.1.&lt;/ref&gt;
:"There were two roads in all."

Such sentences are sometimes called "presentative sentences" and often start with a verb.

===Focus===
The [[Focus (linguistics)|focus]] is the new information, i.e. the message which is being conveyed to the listener.

====Final focus====
Often in Latin the topic comes first, and then the focus. For example, in the sentence below, the topic is "in the bathhouse" (''balnearea''), which has been previously mentioned, and the sub-topic is the hot-room (''assa'') (since it can be assumed that all bath-houses have a hot room); the new information is that Cicero has moved the hot room, and the place to which he has moved it:

:''in balneariis assa &lt;u&gt;in alterum apodyteri angulum promovi&lt;/u&gt;.''&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''ad Qu. fr.'' 3.1.2.&lt;/ref&gt;
:"In the bath-house the hot room &lt;u&gt;I have moved into the other corner of the changing-room&lt;/u&gt;."

Similarly, in the following example, the new information is the sumptuousness of the funerals in question:

:''funera sunt ... &lt;u&gt;magnifica et sumptuosa&lt;/u&gt;''.&lt;ref&gt;Caesar, ''B.G.'' 4.19.4.&lt;/ref&gt;
:"Their funerals are &lt;u&gt;magnificent and expensive&lt;/u&gt;."

In the following example, where the adverb ''celeriter'' "quickly" is placed early in the sentence, the main information is the action "took up arms"; the speed is subsidiary information (Devine and Stephens use the terms "nuclear focus" and "weak focus" for this):&lt;ref&gt;D&amp;S, p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt;

:''nostri celeriter &lt;u&gt;arma ceperunt&lt;/u&gt;''.&lt;ref&gt;Caesar, ''B.G.'', 3.28.&lt;/ref&gt;
:"Our men quickly &lt;u&gt;took up arms&lt;/u&gt;."

Often the verb can be part of the topic,&lt;ref&gt;Sturtevant (1909), p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; as in the following example. The new information, or focus, is the person who followed and the number of ships he brought:

:''hunc secutus &lt;u&gt;Marcius Rufus quaestor navibus duodecim&lt;/u&gt;.''&lt;ref&gt;Caesar, ''B.C.'' 2.23.5.&lt;/ref&gt;
:"Following him came &lt;u&gt;the [[quaestor]] Marcius Rufus with twelve ships&lt;/u&gt;."

====Penultimate focus====
A very frequent place for the focus, however, is in penultimate position, just before the verb or another element. In the example below, Alba has been mentioned in the previous sentence, and the fact that cities have rulers can be assumed; the new information or focus is the name of the ruler at that time, Gaius Cluilius. In this sentence, as in the previous example, the verb itself acts as a topic:

:''imperitabat tum &lt;u&gt;Gaius Cluilius&lt;/u&gt; Albae.''&lt;ref&gt;Livy, 1.22.4.&lt;/ref&gt;
:"The ruler of Alba at that time was &lt;u&gt;Gaius Cluilius&lt;/u&gt;."

When an unemphatic argument, neither focus nor topic, such as ''Albae'' above, follows the focussed word in this way, it is known as a "tail".&lt;ref&gt;D&amp;S, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the following example the fact that northerly regions have winters is already known, and the new information is the fact that they come early:
:''in his locis ... &lt;u&gt;maturae sunt&lt;/u&gt; hiemes''.&lt;ref&gt;Caesar ''B.G.'' 4.20.1.&lt;/ref&gt;
:"In this region, winters (''hiemes'') are early"

In the following, the fire has already been mentioned; the new information is that it continued day and night, with the main emphasis on the fact that it was continuous:
:''&lt;u&gt;nocte ac die continuatum&lt;/u&gt; incendium fuit.''&lt;ref&gt;Livy, 26.27.&lt;/ref&gt;
:"The blaze was &lt;u&gt;continuous by night and day&lt;/u&gt;."

In the following, the fact that the road has been measured can be assumed (Cicero has just mentioned the measurement); the new information is that he measured it himself:
:''sum enim &lt;u&gt;ipse&lt;/u&gt; mensus''.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''ad Quintum fratrem'', 3.1.4.&lt;/ref&gt;
:"For I measured it &lt;u&gt;myself&lt;/u&gt;."

Similarly in the following, the fact that orders were given has already been mentioned, and the fact that they were carried out can be assumed; the new information is that they were carried out quickly:&lt;ref&gt;D&amp;S, p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt;
:''illi imperata &lt;u&gt;celeriter&lt;/u&gt; fecerunt.''&lt;ref&gt;Caesar, ''B.G.'', 5.20.&lt;/ref&gt;
:"They carried out his instructions &lt;u&gt;quickly&lt;/u&gt;."

In the following, the sentence answers the unspoken question "What did the general do with all the money he found in the captured city?", the answer being "He sent it to Rome" (with "Rome" being the most important word):
:''omnem pecuniam &lt;u&gt;Romam&lt;/u&gt; misit.''&lt;ref&gt;Livy, 26.40.13.&lt;/ref&gt;
:"He sent all the money &lt;u&gt;to Rome&lt;/u&gt;."

====Initial focus====
Occasionally, the focus can be given extra emphasis by being placed before the topic.&lt;ref&gt;Panhuis (1982), p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt; In the following pair of sentences, the focus of one is at the beginning, and of the other at the end:
:''&lt;u&gt;Samia&lt;/u&gt; mihi mater fuit; ea habitabat &lt;u&gt;Rhodi&lt;/u&gt;.''&lt;ref&gt;Terence, ''Eun.'' 107&lt;/ref&gt;
:"My mother was &lt;u&gt;[[Samos|Samian]]&lt;/u&gt;; (but at that time) she was living &lt;u&gt;in [[Rhodes]]&lt;/u&gt;."

In the sentence below from Livy, the sentence topic ("that year") and discourse topic ("the war") are in the middle of the sentence. The fact that war was waged on both land and sea is a weak focus placed in penultimate position; but the new and surprising information is that the number of [[Roman legions]] was no fewer than 23, and this comes at the beginning of the sentence before the topic:
:''&lt;u&gt;tribus et viginti&lt;/u&gt; legionibus Romanis eo anno bellum terra marique est gestum.''&lt;ref&gt;Livy, 26.1.1.&lt;/ref&gt;
:"That year war was waged on land and sea with &lt;u&gt;(no fewer than) 23&lt;/u&gt; Roman legions."

===Emphatic topics===
In the following sentence with [[antithesis]], two topics, "the land journey" and "the journey by sea", are contrasted. Because they are contrasted, the topics are more emphatic than the focus:
:''&lt;u&gt;breve&lt;/u&gt; terra iter eo, &lt;u&gt;brevis&lt;/u&gt; navigatio ab Naupacto est.''&lt;ref&gt;Livy 26.26.&lt;/ref&gt;
:"The journey there by land is &lt;u&gt;short&lt;/u&gt;, and the sea journey from Naupactus is also &lt;u&gt;short&lt;/u&gt;."

Similar is the following, where the contrasted topics are "when I was a young man" and "now that I am an old one":
:''&lt;u&gt;defendi rem publicam&lt;/u&gt; adulescens, &lt;u&gt;non deseram&lt;/u&gt; senex.''&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''Phil.'' 2.118.&lt;/ref&gt;
:"&lt;u&gt;I defended the republic&lt;/u&gt; as a young man, &lt;u&gt;I shall not desert her&lt;/u&gt; as an old one."

Devine and Stephens refer to such emphatic topics used contrastively as "co-focus".&lt;ref&gt;D&amp;S, p. 147.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example is the following, where the phrase "this place" (namely the city of Laurentum which was mentioned in the previous sentence) is in the emphatic penultimate position, as though it were the focus:
:''Troia &lt;u&gt;et huic loco&lt;/u&gt; nomen est''.&lt;ref&gt;Livy, 1.1&lt;/ref&gt;
:"The name Troy is also give to this place."

No recordings exist of Latin from the classical period, but it can be assumed that differences in emphasis in Latin were shown by intonation as well as by word order.&lt;ref&gt;D&amp;S, p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Skopeteas (2011), p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Euphony and rhythm==
{{see|Clausula (rhetoric)}}
Euphony and rhythm undoubtedly played a large part in Roman writers' choice of word order, especially in oratory, but also in historians such as Livy. Statements from the writers themselves make it clear that the important consideration was the [[Clausula (rhetoric)|clausula]] or rhythm of the final few syllables of each clause.

Cicero himself, commenting on a speech of the tribune [[Gaius Papirius Carbo (tribune 90 BC)|Gaius Carbo]], quotes the sentence below, which apparently caused the audience to burst into shouts of approval:&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''Orator'' 63.214, discussed by Cunningham (1957), p. 498.&lt;/ref&gt;
:''patris dictum sapiens &lt;u&gt;temeritas fili comprobavit&lt;/u&gt;.''
:"The wise words of the father have been proved by the rash behaviour of his son."

He notes that the sentence would be ruined rhythmically if the word order of the last three words were changed to ''comprobavit fili temeritas''. What was apparently admired here was the [[Clausula (rhetoric)|clausula]] of ''comprobavit'' with its double trochaic – u – – rhythm; whereas ''temeritas'' would make a rhythm of u u u –, which Cicero says would produce an unsatisfying effect in Latin, despite being recommended by Aristotle.

The 1st-century A.D. teacher of oratory, [[Quintilian]], remarks that [[hyperbaton]] (switching words round) is often used to make a sentence more euphonious. He gives the example of the following sentence from the opening of Cicero's ''pro Cluentio'':&lt;ref&gt;Quintilian, 8.6.65&lt;/ref&gt;
:''animadverti, iudices, omnem accusatoris orationem in duas &lt;u&gt;divisam esse partis&lt;/u&gt;''.
:"I noticed, judges, that accuser's speech is divided into two parts (''duas partis'')."

Quintilian says that ''in duas partis divisam esse'' would be correct, but "harsh and inelegant".

In another place he says that to end a sentence with the verb is best, because the verb is the most forceful part of the sentence (''in verbis enim sermonis vis est''); but if putting a verb finally is rhythmically harsh, the verb is frequently moved.&lt;ref&gt;Quintilian 9.4.26; quoted in Greene (1908b), p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example where euphonic considerations may have played a part in word order is the following, from a letter by Pliny the Younger:
:''magnum proventum poetarum &lt;u&gt;annus hic&lt;/u&gt; attulit.''&lt;ref&gt;Pliny, ''Letters'', 1.13.1.&lt;/ref&gt;
:"It is a big crop of poets &lt;u&gt;this year&lt;/u&gt; has brought."

Since ''hic'' was pronounced ''hicc'', the unusual order with the demonstrative following the noun produces a favourite double cretic clausula (– u – – u –).&lt;ref&gt;"a clausula of cretic plus cretic, a favorite with Pliny": Selatie E. Stout, ''Scribe and Critic at Work in Pliny's Letters'' (1954), p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a pleasing [[assonance]] of the vowels ''a-u-i a-u-i'' in the last three words.

==Individual style==
Another factor affecting word order was the individual style of different authors. Devine and Stephens note for example that Livy is fond of putting the object after the verb at the end of the clause (e.g. ''posuit castra'' "he placed a camp", rather than ''castra posuit'', which Caesar preferred).&lt;ref&gt;D&amp;S, pp. 125–6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other differences between authors have been observed. For example, Caesar frequently places a number after a noun (in about 46% of cases), but this is rarer in Cicero (only 10% of cases).&lt;ref&gt;Walker (1918), p. 648.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Verb position==
Several scholars have examined Latin sentences from a syntactic point of view, in particular the position of the verb.

===Final verb===
In sentences with Subject, Object, and Verb, any order is possible. However, some orders are more common than others. In a sample of 568 sentences of Caesar containing all three elements examined by Pinkster, the proportions were:&lt;ref&gt;Pinkster (1990a), reported in Skopeteas (2011), p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;
*SOV : 63%
*OSV : 21%
*OVS : 6%
*VOS : 5%
*SVO : 4%
*VSO : 1%

An example of the typical Subject-Object-Verb (SOV) word order in Caesar is:
:''Caesar suas copias in proximum collem &lt;u&gt;subducit&lt;/u&gt;.''&lt;ref&gt;Caesar, ''B.G.'', 1.22&lt;/ref&gt;
:"Caesar withdrew his forces to the nearest hill."

A dependent infinitive, such as ''interfici'' "to be killed" below, also in Caesar usually precedes its verb:&lt;ref&gt;D&amp;S, p. 143; Skopeteas (2011), p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;
:''magnam partem eorum interfici &lt;u&gt;iussit&lt;/u&gt;.''&lt;ref&gt;Caesar, ''B.C.'', 2.44.&lt;/ref&gt;
:"He ordered the majority of them to be killed."

However, in other genres of Latin, especially more colloquial types such as the comic dialogues of [[Plautus]], Cicero's letters, or [[Petronius]]'s satiric novel, the final position for the verb is much less common.&lt;ref&gt;Hopper (1985), p. 468.&lt;/ref&gt; [[:fr:Jules Marouzeau|Marouzeau]] comments: "In certain texts the medial position of the verb seems more normal than the final."&lt;ref&gt;Marouzeau (1938), p. 82, quoted in Panhuis (1982), p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

Linde (1923) counted the verb final clauses in various texts and produced the following figures:&lt;ref&gt;Linde (1923), pp. 154–156, as reported in Scrivner (2015), p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Author !! Main clauses !! Subordinate clauses
|-
| Caesar (book 2) || 84% || 93%
|-
| Sallust (ch. 1–36) || 75% || 87%
|-
| Cato (ch. 1–27) || 70% || 86%
|-
| Tacitus (ch. 1–37) || 64% || 86%
|-
| Livy (30.30–45) || 63% || 79%
|-
| Seneca (letters 1–9) || 58% || 66%
|-
| Cicero (''de Inventione'' 1–22) || 50% || 68%
|-
| Cicero (''de Re Publica'' 1–32) || 35% || 61%
|}

In all authors, the verb tends to be final more often in subordinate clauses than in main clauses.

Over the centuries, verb-final main clauses became less common. In the writing of [[Egeria (pilgrim)|Egeria]] (Aetheria) of about A.D. 380, only 25% of main clauses and 37% of subordinate clauses are verb-final.

The verb ''sum'' "I am" (or its parts) is an exception to the rule that verbs tend to come at the end of the sentence in Caesar and Cicero. According to one investigation, in Caesar, when the verb is ''sum'', only 10% of main clauses end with the verb.  With other verbs, the figure is 90%.&lt;ref&gt;Walker (1918), p. 654.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Cicero the verb ''sum'' is used at the end of a sentence slightly more often, in 20%–35% of main clauses. However, this is less than with other verbs, for which the figure is 55%–70%.

The above figures apply to sentences where ''sum'' is used as in independent verb (e.g. ''difficile est'' "it is difficult"), rather than as an [[Auxiliary verb|auxiliary]] to another verb (e.g. ''profectus est'' "he set out"), when it frequently ends the clause.

Different authors have different preferences. In [[Sallust]], who has a rather conservative style, the verb ''sum'' (except where existential) tends to go at the end of the sentence.&lt;ref&gt;D&amp;S, pp.
 216–7.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cato the Elder|Cato]] also usually puts the verb ''sum'' finally, except in specificational and identity sentences, such as the following:&lt;ref&gt;D&amp;S, pp. 218–9.&lt;/ref&gt;
:''haec erunt vilici officia''.&lt;ref&gt;Cato, ''de re Rus.'' 5.1.&lt;/ref&gt;
:"The following will be the duties of the farm-manager."

===Penultimate verb===
Quite commonly, especially in certain authors such as Nepos and Livy, the verb can come in penultimate position, followed by the object, as in this example:
:''Popilius virga quam in manu gerebat &lt;u&gt;circumscripsit&lt;/u&gt; regem.'' (Livy)&lt;ref&gt;Livy, 45.12.&lt;/ref&gt;
:"Popilius with a stick which he was holding in his hand drew a circle round the king."

This stylistic feature, consisting of Verb + Object at the end of a clause, is referred to by Devine and Stephens as "V-bar syntax". It is much less common in Caesar than in Livy. In Caesar the phrase ''castra posuit/ponit'' "placed a camp" always comes in that order, but in Livy it is found as ''posuit castra'' in 45 out of 55 examples (82%).&lt;ref&gt;D&amp;S, pp. 125-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Even in Caesar, however, it is not uncommon for a locative phrase of goal or source to follow the verb, especially when the locative is focussed:&lt;ref&gt;D&amp;S, p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt;
:''exercitum &lt;u&gt;reducit&lt;/u&gt; ad mare''.&lt;ref&gt;Caesar, ''B.G.'', 5.23.&lt;/ref&gt;
:"He led the army back to the sea."

:''Pompeius ... Luceria &lt;u&gt;proficiscitur&lt;/u&gt; Canusium''.&lt;ref&gt;Caesar, ''B.C.'', 1.24.1.&lt;/ref&gt;
:"Pompey from Luceria departed for Canusium."

:''nemo &lt;u&gt;egreditur&lt;/u&gt; e castris''.&lt;ref&gt;Caesar, ''B.G.'', 1.81.&lt;/ref&gt;
:"No one went out of the camp."

Other prepositional phrases can also sometimes follow the verb:
:''eo &lt;u&gt;proficiscitur&lt;/u&gt; cum legionibus.''&lt;ref&gt;Caesar, ''B.G.'', 5.21.&lt;/ref&gt;
:"He set off for that place with the legions."

Other types of phrases which can sometimes follow a verb are relative clauses:&lt;ref&gt;D&amp;S, p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt;
:''eadem &lt;u&gt;cogitans&lt;/u&gt; quae ante senserat.''&lt;ref&gt;Caesar, ''B.G.'', 7.53.&lt;/ref&gt;
:"Thinking the same as he had felt before."

Dependent clauses with ''ut'' almost always follow the verb:&lt;ref&gt;D&amp;S, p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt;
:''Ubiis &lt;u&gt;imperat&lt;/u&gt; ut pecora deducant.''&lt;ref&gt;Caesar, ''B.G.'', 6.10&lt;/ref&gt;
:"He orders the Ubii to bring in their cattle."

Another kind of situation where the verb commonly comes in penultimate position is when it is followed by a strongly focussed negative pronoun such as ''nemo'' "no one" or ''quisquam'' "anyone":&lt;ref&gt;D&amp;S, p. 172.&lt;/ref&gt;
:''quod ante id tempus &lt;u&gt;accidit&lt;/u&gt; nulli''.&lt;ref&gt;Caesar, ''B.G.'', 2.35.&lt;/ref&gt;
:"Which had never happened to anyone before."

:''emptor ... &lt;u&gt;inventus est&lt;/u&gt; nemo.''&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''Phil.'' 11.13.&lt;/ref&gt;
:"No buyer at all was found."

The grammatical subject can come after the verb in sentences of the following kind where it is focussed, and the verb itself forms part of the topic:&lt;ref&gt;D&amp;S, p. 177.&lt;/ref&gt;
:''Africam initio &lt;u&gt;habuere&lt;/u&gt; Gaetuli et Libyes.''&lt;ref&gt;Sallust, ''Jug.'', 18.1.&lt;/ref&gt;
:"The original inhabitants of Africa were the Gaetulans and Libyans."

Similarly in sentences such as the following, it is reasonable to suppose that the object is focussed:&lt;ref&gt;D&amp;S, p. 177.&lt;/ref&gt;
:''nos provinciae &lt;u&gt;praefecimus&lt;/u&gt; Caelium.''&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''ad Att.'', 6.6.3.&lt;/ref&gt;
:"The person I have put in charge of the province is Caelius."

This type of sentence where the focus is on the object at the end should be distinguished from sentences with V-bar syntax such as ''circumscripsit regem'' "he drew a circle round the king" mentioned above, in which the object is not focussed.

===Initial verb===
====Sudden actions====
Initial verbs are often used in sentences such as the following, which describe a sudden or immediate consequence of a previous event:&lt;ref&gt;D&amp;S, p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt;

:''&lt;u&gt;profugiunt&lt;/u&gt; statim ex urbe tribuni plebis.''&lt;ref&gt;Caesar, ''B.C.'' 1.5&lt;/ref&gt;
:"The tribunes immediately fled the city."

:''&lt;u&gt;videt&lt;/u&gt; imminere hostes ... &lt;u&gt;capit&lt;/u&gt; arma a proximis ...''&lt;ref&gt;Caesar, ''B.C.'' 6.38&lt;/ref&gt;
:"He sees the enemy threatening ... he immediately seizes weapons from those next to him ..."

:''dum titulos perlegimus, &lt;u&gt;complosit&lt;/u&gt; Trimalchio manus''.&lt;ref&gt;Petronius, ''Sat.'' 34.&lt;/ref&gt;
:"While we were reading the labels, Trimalchio suddenly clapped his hands."

:''&lt;u&gt;conclamat&lt;/u&gt; vir paterque!''&lt;ref&gt;Livy 1.58.12.&lt;/ref&gt;
:"There was an immediate shout from husband and father!"

Such sentences are of a type known as "thetic" sentences, which answer "What happened?" rather than "What did the subject do?" Frequently they are in the historic present tense (in Caesar the historic present is six times as common in verb-initial sentences as the perfect tense).&lt;ref&gt;D&amp;S, p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes, even if the verb does not come at the beginning, the suddenness of the action can be shown by raising it partially. Thus the final words of this sentence, which would normally be ''de loco superiore impetum faciunt'' "they make an attack from higher ground", are changed to ''faciunt de loco superiore impetum'' to emphasise the element of surprise:
:''statim complures cum telis in hunc &lt;u&gt;faciunt&lt;/u&gt; de loco superiore impetum''.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''in Milonem'' 29.&lt;/ref&gt;
:"Immediately several men with weapons make a (sudden) attack on my client from higher ground."

====Agentless verbs====
The agent of the verb in thetic sentences tends to be less important than the verb; consequently, verb-initial sentences often have a verb in the passive voice. In Caesar, the passive verb ''mittitur'' ("is sent") is much commoner sentence-initially than ''mittit'' ("he sends"):&lt;ref&gt;D&amp;S, p. 154.&lt;/ref&gt;
:''&lt;u&gt;defertur&lt;/u&gt; ea res ad Caesarem''.&lt;ref&gt;Caesar, ''B.G.'' 5.25.&lt;/ref&gt;
:"The matter was reported to Caesar."

:''&lt;u&gt;pugnatum est&lt;/u&gt; ab utrisque acriter''.&lt;ref&gt;Caesar, ''B.G.'' 3.21.&lt;/ref&gt;
:"There was fierce fighting on both sides."

:''&lt;u&gt;itur&lt;/u&gt; in antiquam silvam.''&lt;ref&gt;Virgil, ''Aeneid'' 6.175.&lt;/ref&gt;
:"They entered an ancient forest."

Intransitive verbs of the type called [[unaccusative verb]]s, that is, verbs which have no voluntary agent, such as ''maneo'' "remain", ''cresco'' "grow", ''sto'' "stand", ''pateo'' "be open", ''mano'' "spread", also often begin thetic sentences:&lt;ref&gt;D&amp;S, pp. 151–2.&lt;/ref&gt;
:''&lt;u&gt;manat&lt;/u&gt; tota urbe rumor.''&lt;ref&gt;Livy, 2.49.1.&lt;/ref&gt;
:"A rumour spread all over the city."

:''&lt;u&gt;fit&lt;/u&gt; magna caedes.''&lt;ref&gt;Caesar, ''B.G.'' 7.70&lt;/ref&gt;
:"A great slaughter took place."

====Situations====
Thetic sentences with initial verb can also be explanatory or give background information:&lt;ref&gt;D&amp;S, p. 161.&lt;/ref&gt;
:''&lt;u&gt;miserat&lt;/u&gt; enim Pharnaces coronam auream''.&lt;ref&gt;[[de Bello Alexandrino]] 70.&lt;/ref&gt;
:"For Pharnaces had sent a golden crown."

:''&lt;u&gt;crescebat&lt;/u&gt; interim urbs''.&lt;ref&gt;Livy, 1.8.4.&lt;/ref&gt;
:"Meanwhile the city was growing."

Presentational verbs (e.g. ''erat'' "there was") are also usually sentence-initial:&lt;ref&gt;D&amp;S, p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt;
:''&lt;u&gt;erat&lt;/u&gt; vallis inter duas acies''.&lt;ref&gt;Caesar, ''Civ.'' 2.24.1.&lt;/ref&gt;
:"There was a valley between the two battle-lines."

:''&lt;u&gt;venerat&lt;/u&gt; ad eum ... Laetilius quidam''.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''Verr.'' 2.2.64.&lt;/ref&gt;
:"There had come to him a certain Laetilius."

====Emphatic verb====
A verb at the beginning of the sentence is often emphatic, perhaps expressing something surprising:
:''&lt;u&gt;laudat&lt;/u&gt; Africanum Panaetius...; quidni laudet?''&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''de Off.'', 2.76.&lt;/ref&gt;
:"Panaetius praises Africanus...; why should he not praise him?"

Another situation favouring initial verb position is where the verb is in contrastive focus ([[antithesis]]), as in the following:&lt;ref&gt;D&amp;S, p, 147.&lt;/ref&gt;
:''&lt;u&gt;excisa est&lt;/u&gt; enim arbor, non evulsa.''&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''ad Att.'' 15.4.2&lt;/ref&gt;
:"For the tree was cut down, not uprooted."

The verbs also come initially in sentences like the one below, in which there is a double antithesis.&lt;ref&gt;D&amp;S, p, 147.&lt;/ref&gt; These are examples of sentences with initial focus (see above):

:''&lt;u&gt;contempsisti&lt;/u&gt; L. Murenae genus, &lt;u&gt;extulisti&lt;/u&gt; tuum''.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''pro Mur.'' 15.&lt;/ref&gt;
:"&lt;u&gt;You scorned&lt;/u&gt; Lucius Murena's family and &lt;u&gt;you exalted&lt;/u&gt; your own."

Another reason for using a sentence-initial verb is when the speaker is emphatically asserting the truth of a fact:&lt;ref&gt;D&amp;S, pp. 145–147.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Spevak (2010), p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt;
:''num negare audes? ... &lt;u&gt;fuisti&lt;/u&gt; igitur apud Laecam illa nocte, Catilina!''&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''Cat.'' 1.9.&lt;/ref&gt;
:"Do you dare deny it? ... &lt;u&gt;You were&lt;/u&gt; therefore at Laeca's house that night, Catiline!"

:''&lt;u&gt;erit&lt;/u&gt;, &lt;u&gt;erit&lt;/u&gt; illud profecto tempus''.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''pro Milone'', 69.&lt;/ref&gt;
:"&lt;u&gt;It will come&lt;/u&gt;, that time will certainly come."

:''&lt;u&gt;vidi&lt;/u&gt;, simul cum populo Romano, forum comitiumque adornatum...''.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''Verr.'' 2.1.58.&lt;/ref&gt;
:"(With my own eyes) I saw, together with the Roman people, the [[Roman forum|forum]] and [[comitium]] adorned..."

:''&lt;u&gt;est&lt;/u&gt; enim sine dubio domus iuris consulti totius oraculum civitatis''.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''de Orat.'' 1.200.&lt;/ref&gt;
:"For without doubt, the house of a legal expert is (like) an oracle of the whole city."

Verbs with meanings such as "move", "offend", "make anxious" etc., known as "psych" verbs, also often come sentence-initially. In Livy, the verb ''movit'' ("moved") frequently (although not always) comes first if it is used in the metaphorical sense:&lt;ref&gt;D&amp;S, p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt;
:''&lt;u&gt;movit&lt;/u&gt; aliquantum oratio regis legatos.''&lt;ref&gt;Livy, 39.29.&lt;/ref&gt;
:"The king's speech persuaded the ambassadors to a certain extent."

But when the sense is literal, it always come finally:
:''castra ab Thermopylis ad Heracleam &lt;u&gt;movit&lt;/u&gt;.''&lt;ref&gt;Livy, 36.22.&lt;/ref&gt;
:"He moved camp from Thermopylae to Heraclea."

====Verb as topic====
Another reason for putting the verb first is that it represents the topic of the sentence, while the grammatical subject which follows it is the focus.&lt;ref&gt;Sturtevant (1909), p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, after mentioning that he has been upset by the death of someone, Pliny goes on to say:
:''&lt;u&gt;decessit&lt;/u&gt; Corellius Rufus''.&lt;ref&gt;Pliny, ''Letters'', 1.12.&lt;/ref&gt;
:"The person who died was Corellius Rufus."

Other examples of this are given above in the section on topic and focus.

====Questions and imperatives====
An initial verb can also be used (without emphasis) in yes-no questions:
:''&lt;u&gt;est&lt;/u&gt;ne frater intus?''&lt;ref&gt;Terence, ''Adelphi'' 571.&lt;/ref&gt;
:"Is my brother inside?"

Imperatives also often (but not always) come at the beginning of a sentence:&lt;ref&gt;D&amp;S, p. 149.&lt;/ref&gt;
:''&lt;u&gt;da&lt;/u&gt; mi basia mille, deinde centum!''&lt;ref&gt;Catullus 5.&lt;/ref&gt;
:"Give me a thousand kisses, then a hundred!"

===The verb "to be"===
The verb ''sum'' ("I am") can be used as an auxiliary verb (e.g. ''interfectus est'' "he was killed"), as a copula (e.g. ''dives erat'' "he was rich") or as an existential verb, specifying the existence of something.

====Existential====
As an existential verb, ''est'' (or its past tense ''erat'') often goes at the beginning of the sentence:&lt;ref&gt;Skopeteas (2011), p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;
:''&lt;u&gt;erat&lt;/u&gt; a septentrionibus collis''.&lt;ref&gt;Caesar, ''B.G.'' 7.83.&lt;/ref&gt;
:"On the north side, there was a hill."

:''&lt;u&gt;erat&lt;/u&gt; vallis inter duas acies''.&lt;ref&gt;Caesar, ''B.C.'' 2.34.1.&lt;/ref&gt;
:"There was a valley between the two armies."

Of these two orders, the first (with the locative phrase between the verb and the noun) is by far the most common. The second example above is unusual in that it does not present new information but merely reminds the reader of what has already been said ("There was a valley, as mentioned above...").&lt;ref&gt;D&amp;S, pp. 209–10.&lt;/ref&gt;

In other sentences, the verb ''est'' or ''erat'' follows the word which it is presenting, or comes in the middle of a phrase in hyperbaton:&lt;ref&gt;D&amp;S, pp. 211–2.&lt;/ref&gt;
:''flumen &lt;u&gt;est&lt;/u&gt; Arar, quod ... in Rhodanum influit''.&lt;ref&gt;Caesar, ''B.G.'' 1.12.1.&lt;/ref&gt;
:"There is a river called the Arar, which flows into the Rhone."

:''in eo flumine pons &lt;u&gt;erat&lt;/u&gt;''.&lt;ref&gt;Caesar, ''B.G.'' 2.5&lt;/ref&gt;
:"On that river there was a bridge."

:''palus &lt;u&gt;erat&lt;/u&gt; non magna inter nostrum atque hostium exercitum.''&lt;ref&gt;Caesar, ''B.G.'' 2.9.&lt;/ref&gt;
:"There was a marsh, not particularly large, between our army and the enemies' one.''

:''apud eos magnae &lt;u&gt;sunt&lt;/u&gt; ferrariae.''&lt;ref&gt;Caesar, ''B.G.'' 7.22.&lt;/ref&gt;
:"In their country there are large iron-mines."

====Auxiliary====
When ''est'' is an auxiliary, it normally follows the participle which it is used with:
:''in summo otio rediens a cena Romae &lt;u&gt;occisus est&lt;/u&gt;''.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''pro Rosc.'' 126.&lt;/ref&gt;
:"In the middle of peace-time, he was killed in Rome while returning from dinner."

:''statim Romam &lt;u&gt;profectus est&lt;/u&gt;''.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''Att.'' 12.18.1.&lt;/ref&gt;
:"He immediately departed for Rome."

Sometimes, however, the auxiliary can move forward to follow some significant item of information, such as a quantity phrase or focussed word:&lt;ref&gt;D&amp;S, pp. 182, 189.&lt;/ref&gt;
:''magnusque eorum numerus &lt;u&gt;est occisus&lt;/u&gt;.''&lt;ref&gt;Caesar, ''B.G.'' 4.37.4.&lt;/ref&gt;
:"and a large number of them were killed."

:''inde Quinctius Corinthum &lt;u&gt;est profectus&lt;/u&gt;''.&lt;ref&gt;Livy, 32.40.&lt;/ref&gt;
:"From there Quinctius departed for Corinth."

In subordinate clauses the auxiliary frequently raises to the position directly after the conjunction or relative pronoun:&lt;ref&gt;D&amp;S, pp. 184–5.&lt;/ref&gt;
:''eodem unde &lt;u&gt;erant&lt;/u&gt; profectae''.&lt;ref&gt;Caesar, ''B.G.'' 4.28.&lt;/ref&gt;
:"to that same place from where they had set out"

But if there is a focus word following the conjunction or relative pronoun, the auxiliary follows that and does not raise to the second position:
:''quae ad ancoras &lt;u&gt;erant&lt;/u&gt; deligatae''.&lt;ref&gt;Caesar, ''B.G.'' 4.29&lt;/ref&gt;
:"which had been tied to anchors''

In a negative sentence, the auxiliary tends to attach itself to the word ''non'', and does not move forward of it. ''Non est'' can either precede or follow the participle:&lt;ref&gt;D&amp;S, pp. 183–4.&lt;/ref&gt;
:''qua perfectum opus &lt;u&gt;non erat&lt;/u&gt;''.&lt;ref&gt;Caesar, ''B.G.'' 3.63.&lt;/ref&gt;
:"where the work had not been completed".

:''conloquendi Caesari causa visa &lt;u&gt;non est&lt;/u&gt;''.&lt;ref&gt;Caesar, ''B.G.'' 1.47.2.&lt;/ref&gt;
:"There didn't seem to Caesar to be any reason for parlaying."

:''Pollicem, si adhuc &lt;u&gt;non est&lt;/u&gt; profectus, quam primum fac extrudas''.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''Fam.'' 14.6.&lt;/ref&gt;
:"If Pollux still hasn't departed, set him on his way as soon as you can."

====Copula====
When ''est'' is a copula, it tends to be unemphatic and to be placed after a stronger word, or between two strong words:&lt;ref&gt;D&amp;S, pp. 198–201.&lt;/ref&gt;
:''horum omnium fortissimi &lt;u&gt;sunt&lt;/u&gt; Belgae''&lt;ref&gt;Caesar, ''B.G.'' 1.1.&lt;/ref&gt;
:"Of all these the most warlike are the Belgae."

:''cuius pater Caesaris &lt;u&gt;erat&lt;/u&gt; legatus''&lt;ref&gt;Caesar, ''B.G.'' 1.8.&lt;/ref&gt;
:"whose father was a legate of Caesar"

This strong word which ''est'' follows can also be the subject:&lt;ref&gt;D&amp;S, p. 201.&lt;/ref&gt;
:''Gallia &lt;u&gt;est&lt;/u&gt; omnis divisa in partis tris.''&lt;ref&gt;Caesar, ''B.G.'' 1.1.&lt;/ref&gt;
:"Gaul, considered as a whole, is divided into three parts."

It is also possible for the subject to follow the copula:&lt;ref&gt;D&amp;S, p. 199.&lt;/ref&gt;
:''plena &lt;u&gt;erant&lt;/u&gt; omnia timoris et luctus''.&lt;ref&gt;Caesar, ''B.C' 2.41&lt;/ref&gt;
:"Everything was full of fear and mourning."

Or the order may be Adjective, Subject, Copula:&lt;ref&gt;D&amp;S, p. 200.&lt;/ref&gt;
:''quamquam regi infesta plebes &lt;u&gt;erat&lt;/u&gt;.''
:"Although the common people were hostile to the king.''&lt;ref&gt;Sallust, ''Jug.'' 33.3.&lt;/ref&gt;

In some sentences, the copula may begin the sentence:&lt;ref&gt;D&amp;S, p. 172.&lt;/ref&gt;
:''&lt;u&gt;erat&lt;/u&gt; eo tempore Antonius Brundisii''.&lt;ref&gt;Caesar, ''B.C.'' 3.24&lt;/ref&gt;
:"At that time, Antonius was in Brundisium."

When the sentence is negative, however, the verb ''est'' follows ''non'' and tends to be clause-final:&lt;ref&gt;D&amp;S, p. 202.&lt;/ref&gt;
:''id autem difficile &lt;u&gt;non est&lt;/u&gt;''.&lt;ref&gt;Caesar, ''B.G.'' 3.86.&lt;/ref&gt;
:"Moreover, this isn't difficult."

==Adjective position==
In Latin, an adjective can either precede or follow its noun: for example, "a good man" can be both ''bonus vir''&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Cicero ''Att.'' 7.7.1.&lt;/ref&gt; or ''vir bonus''.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Cicero, ''Verr.'' 2.3.166.&lt;/ref&gt; Some kinds of adjectives are more inclined to follow the noun, others to precede, but "the precise factors conditioning the variation are not always obvious".&lt;ref&gt;D&amp;S, p. 403.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Caesar and Cicero, it has been found that the majority (60%–80%) of ordinary adjectives, not counting pronominals and numerals, precede their nouns.&lt;ref&gt;See table by Mabel Merryman, reported in Walker (1918), p. 648.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Factors affecting adjective position===
====Semantic====
One factor affecting the order is semantic. As a general rule, adjectives which express an inherent property of the noun, such as "gold" in "gold ring", tend to follow it.&lt;ref&gt;D&amp;S, p. 411.&lt;/ref&gt; Where the adjective is more salient or important than the noun, as "Appian" in "Appian Way" (''via Appia''), it also tends to follow it.&lt;ref&gt;McFadden: review of Spevak (2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

Adjectives which express a subjective evaluation, such as ''gravis'' "serious", on the other hand, usually go before the noun.&lt;ref&gt;McFadden: review of Spevak (2014).&lt;/ref&gt; Adjectives of size and quantity also usually precede (in 91% of examples in Caesar, 83% in Cicero), as do demonstrative adjectives such as ''hic'' "this" and ''ille'' "that" (99% in Caesar, 95% in Cicero).&lt;ref&gt;Walker (1918), p. 648.&lt;/ref&gt;

Adjectives where there is a choice between two alternatives, such as "left" or "right", or "preceding" and "following", also tend to go before the noun. However, the opposite order (e.g. ''manu sinistra'' "with left hand", Catullus 12) is also found.

====Contrast and focus====
Other factors such as focus and contrast may also affect the order. When there is contrastive focus the adjective will precede, even if it is one such as a geographical name which normally follows:
:''utrum &lt;u&gt;bonus&lt;/u&gt; vir est an malus?''&lt;ref&gt;[[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]], ''de Ben.'' 4.40.3.&lt;/ref&gt;
:"Is he a good man or a bad one?"

:''unus in Falisco, alter in &lt;u&gt;Vaticano&lt;/u&gt; agro.''&lt;ref&gt;Livy, 10.26.15.&lt;/ref&gt;
:"One in the Faliscan and the other in Vatican territory."

Even when the contrast is not explicit, a strong focus may cause the adjective to come first:
:''&lt;u&gt;Aurelia&lt;/u&gt; via profectus est''.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''Cat.'' 2.6.&lt;/ref&gt;
:"It is the Aurelian Way that he has set out on (not any other)."

On the other hand, an adjective which normally precedes, such as a number, can follow the noun when it is focussed or emphasised:
:''naves sunt combustae &lt;u&gt;quinque&lt;/u&gt;''&lt;ref&gt;Caesar ''B.C.'' 3.101.4.&lt;/ref&gt;
:"No fewer than five ships were burnt out."

Contrast the following, where the emphasis is on ''triremes'':
:''praeterea &lt;u&gt;duae&lt;/u&gt; sunt depressae triremes''.&lt;ref&gt;Caesar ''B.C.'' 3.101.6.&lt;/ref&gt;
:"In addition, two [[trireme]]s were also sunk."

====Diachronic change====
Over time the position of adjectives can be seen changing, for example, between [[Cato the Elder]] (2nd century BC) and [[Columella]] (1st century AD). Adjectives describing the type of something, such as ''ligneus'' "wooden", ''olearius'' "designed for oil" or ''novus'' "new" always follow the noun in Cato, but can come either before or after in Columella.&lt;ref&gt;D&amp;S, pp. 405–14; 449-452.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Cato, the adjective ''magnus'' "big" follows its noun in 7 out of 9 examples, e.g. ''tempestates magnas'' "big storms", but in Caesar about 95% of examples go before the noun.&lt;ref&gt;D&amp;S, pp. 471–2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Livy uses this antique word order at a dramatic moment in his history when he reports the words of the magistrate announcing the news of the disaster at the [[battle of Lake Trasimene]] in 217 BC:
:''tandem haud multo ante solis occasum M. Pomponius praetor ‘&lt;u&gt;pugna&lt;/u&gt;’ inquit ‘&lt;u&gt;magna&lt;/u&gt; victi sumus’.''&lt;ref&gt;Livy, 22.7.&lt;/ref&gt;
:"At last not long before sunset, Marcus Pomponius the [[praetor]] announced: 'We have been defeated in a great battle'."

Another adjective which changes over time is ''omnis'' "all". In Cato this word goes before or after the noun with equal frequency, but in Cicero's speeches 80% of the time it precedes, and in Caesar it goes before the noun even more commonly.&lt;ref&gt;D&amp;S, p. 509.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Stylistic preferences====
As with other aspects of word order, stylistic preferences also play a part in adjective order. For example, the adjective ''superior'' in its literal sense of "higher" (e.g. ''ex loco superiore'' "from a higher place") usually comes after the noun in Cicero and in Caesar, but in Livy the position before the noun (''ex superiore loco'') is much commoner.&lt;ref&gt;D&amp;S, p. 452. (Their statistics omit some examples, however.)&lt;/ref&gt; Vitruvius and Seneca the Younger also preferred the earlier position.&lt;ref&gt;Perseus PhiloLogic search.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Commonly used phrases====
In certain commonly used phrases, the adjective comes after the noun without variation:&lt;ref&gt;Walker (1918), p. 649.&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
:''res publica'' 
:"the Republic"

:''populus Romanus'' 
:"the Roman people"

:''pontifex maximus'' 
:"the chief priest"

:''di immortales'' 
:"immortal gods"

In others, the position after the noun is more common but not fixed. The phrase ''bellum civile'' "civil war" has the adjective following in about 60% of Cicero's examples.&lt;ref&gt;D&amp;S, p. 442.&lt;/ref&gt;

In other commonly used phrases, the adjective always comes first. These include certain terms of relative position and certain adjectives of time:&lt;ref&gt;Walker (1918), p. 649.&lt;/ref&gt;

:''dextrum cornu'' 
:"the right wing"

:''novissimum agmen'' 
:"the rearmost (part of the) column of soldiers"

:''hesterno die'' 
:"yesterday"

:''postero die'' 
:"the following day"

In other common phrases, such as ''prima luce'' "at first light", the adjective usually comes first, but ''luce prima'' is also found.

===Hyperbaton===
{{main|Hyperbaton}}
Often adjectives are emphasised by separating them from the noun by other words (a technique known as [[hyperbaton]]). This is especially true of adjectives of size and quantity, but also superlatives, comparatives, demonstratives, and possessives.&lt;ref&gt;D&amp;S, pp. 542–44.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Premodifier hyperbaton====
Often the adjective precedes the noun:
:''&lt;u&gt;omnibus&lt;/u&gt; his adfuit &lt;u&gt;pugnis&lt;/u&gt;''.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''Phil.'' 2.75.&lt;/ref&gt;
:"He was present at &lt;u&gt;all these battles&lt;/u&gt;."

The separation can sometimes be a long one:

:''&lt;u&gt;multa&lt;/u&gt; de Hieronis regis fide perpetua erga populum Romanum &lt;u&gt;verba&lt;/u&gt; fecerunt.''&lt;ref&gt;Livy, 26.30.&lt;/ref&gt;
:"They spoke at great length about the constant loyalty of King Hiero towards the Roman people."

Premodifying adjectives in hyperbaton often have focus or contrastive emphasis.&lt;ref&gt;D&amp;S, p. 544.&lt;/ref&gt; In the following example, "these particular" floods are contrasted with some earlier ones which lasted a shorter time:
:''&lt;u&gt;hae&lt;/u&gt; permanserunt &lt;u&gt;aquae&lt;/u&gt; dies complures.''&lt;ref&gt;Caesar, ''B.C.'' 1.50.1.&lt;/ref&gt;
:"This time the flood waters lasted several days."

Sometimes they are merely brought to the front to emphasise them. So in the following example, the adjective ''cruentum'' "bloody" is raised to the beginning of the sentence to highlight it and make it stand out:
:''&lt;u&gt;cruentum&lt;/u&gt; alte tollens Brutus &lt;u&gt;pugionem&lt;/u&gt;''.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''Phil.'' 2.28.&lt;/ref&gt;
:"Brutus, raising high the &lt;u&gt;bloodstained dagger&lt;/u&gt; (''cruentum ... pugionem'')".

Sometimes both the noun and the adjective are important or focussed:&lt;ref&gt;D&amp;S, p. 547.&lt;/ref&gt;

:''&lt;u&gt;magnus&lt;/u&gt; omnium incessit &lt;u&gt;timor&lt;/u&gt; animis.''&lt;ref&gt;Caesar, ''B.C.'' 2.29.&lt;/ref&gt;
:"Great fear overcame the minds of all of them."

This last sentence is an example of double hyperbaton, since ''omnium ... animis'' "everyone's minds" is an example of genitive hyperbaton.

====Postmodifier hyperbaton====
Hyperbaton is also possible when the adjective follows the noun.&lt;ref&gt;D&amp;S, p. 534.&lt;/ref&gt; Often with postmodifier hyperbaton, the noun is indefinite:&lt;ref&gt;D&amp;S, p. 538.&lt;/ref&gt;
:''&lt;u&gt;tempestates&lt;/u&gt; coortae sunt &lt;u&gt;maximae&lt;/u&gt;''.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''Verr.'' 2.1.46.&lt;/ref&gt;
:"Some very great storms arose."

:''&lt;u&gt;praeda&lt;/u&gt; potitus &lt;u&gt;ingenti&lt;/u&gt; est''.&lt;ref&gt;Livy 40.49.1.&lt;/ref&gt;
:"He obtained &lt;u&gt;an enormous amount of booty&lt;/u&gt;."

If the noun is definite, the adjective can be predicative:&lt;ref&gt;D&amp;S, 539.&lt;/ref&gt;
:''&lt;u&gt;agros&lt;/u&gt; deseruit &lt;u&gt;incultos&lt;/u&gt;''.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''de Fin.'' 5.87.&lt;/ref&gt;
:"He abandoned the fields, leaving them uncultivated."

Sometimes the noun, not the adjective, is focussed, and the adjective is a mere tail, as in the following:&lt;ref&gt;D&amp;S, p. 540.&lt;/ref&gt;
:''multum te in eo &lt;u&gt;frater&lt;/u&gt; adiuvabit &lt;u&gt;meus&lt;/u&gt;, multum Balbus''.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''ad Fam.'' 7.7.2.&lt;/ref&gt;
:"My brother will help you a lot in this, and so will Balbus."

===Numbers===
Cardinal numbers tend to come before the noun in Cicero (90% of examples), but in Caesar only 54% come before the noun.&lt;ref&gt;Walker (1918), p. 648.&lt;/ref&gt; When following the noun, the numeral is often focussed, as in the following, where the important information is in the number "three":
:''Gallia est ... divisa in partis &lt;u&gt;tris&lt;/u&gt;.''&lt;ref&gt;Caesar, ''B.G.'' 1.1.1.&lt;/ref&gt;
:"Gaul is divided into three parts."

Distributive or ''[[plurale tantum|pluralia tantum]]'' numerals usually precede the noun, both in Cicero and Caesar:
:''Octavius &lt;u&gt;quinis&lt;/u&gt; castris oppidum circumdedit''.&lt;ref&gt;Caesar, ''B.C''. 3.9.4.&lt;/ref&gt;
:"Octavius surrounded the town with five camps."

Ordinals precede the noun in 73% of Caesar's examples. But when used with ''hora'', they follow:
:''ab hora &lt;u&gt;septima&lt;/u&gt; ad vesperum pugnatum sit''.&lt;ref&gt;Caesar, ''B.G.'' 1.26.2.&lt;/ref&gt;
:"The fight continued from the seventh hour until evening."

===Possessive adjectives===
====Personal possessives====
Possessive adjectives, such as ''meus'' "my", ''suus'' "his/their", are fairly evenly distributed (68% preceding in Caesar, 56% in a sample of Cicero speeches).&lt;ref&gt;Walker (1918), p. 648.&lt;/ref&gt; When a possessive follows the noun it is unemphatic:&lt;ref&gt;Ullman (1919), pp. 408–9.&lt;/ref&gt;
:''per C. Valerium, ... familiarem &lt;u&gt;suum&lt;/u&gt;, cum eo conloquitur''.&lt;ref&gt;Caesar, ''B.G.'' 1.19.3.&lt;/ref&gt;
:"He spoke with him through his friend Gaius Valerius."

:''quo usque tandem abutēre, Catilina, patientiā &lt;u&gt;nostrā&lt;/u&gt;?''&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''Cat.'' 1.1.&lt;/ref&gt;
:"For how long, Catiline, will you continue to abuse our patience?"

When it is more emphatic, or in contrastive focus, it precedes:
:''si, in tanta scriptorum turba, &lt;u&gt;mea&lt;/u&gt; fama in obscuro sit''.&lt;ref&gt;Livy, 1 pr. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;
:"If, in such a great crowd of writers, &lt;u&gt;my own&lt;/u&gt; fame is hidden..."

:''non ad alterius praescriptum, sed ad &lt;u&gt;suum&lt;/u&gt; arbitrium''.&lt;ref&gt;Caesar, ''B.G.'' 1.36.1.&lt;/ref&gt;
:"not according to someone else's dictation, but at &lt;u&gt;their own&lt;/u&gt; discretion".

However, the possessive adjective preceding the noun is not always emphatic: when it is tucked away between two more emphatic words it is usually unemphatic:&lt;ref&gt;Ullman (1919), p. 411.&lt;/ref&gt;
:''domum &lt;u&gt;mei&lt;/u&gt; fratris incenderat''.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''Mil.'' 87.&lt;/ref&gt;
:"He had set fire to my brother's house."

It is also usual for the possessive to precede the noun when vocative:
:'' 'Quid est,' inquit, '&lt;u&gt;mea&lt;/u&gt; Tertia? quid tristis es?' – '&lt;u&gt;Mi&lt;/u&gt; pater,' inquit,'Persa periit'.''&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''Div.'' 1.103.&lt;/ref&gt;
:"'What is it, my Tertia? Why are you sad?' – 'My father,' she said, 'Persa has died'."

====''eius'' and ''eorum''====
The 3rd person genitive pronouns, ''eius'' "his" and ''eorum'' "their", tend to precede their noun in Caesar (in 73% of instances).&lt;ref&gt;Ullman (1919), p. 414.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the possessive adjectives, however, there is often no particular emphasis when they are used before a noun:
:''eius adventu ... cognito''.&lt;ref&gt;Caesar, ''B.G.'' 7.88.1&lt;/ref&gt;
:"when his arrival was learnt about"

With certain nouns, such as ''frater eius'' "his brother" or ''familiaris eius'' "his friend", however, the position after the noun is slightly more usual.

===Pronominal adjectives===
Pronominal adjectives are those which can serve both as pronouns and adjectives, such as ''hic'' "this", ''alius'' "another", ''quidam'' "a certain (man)" and so on. These adjectives generally have genitive singular ''-ius'' and dative singular ''-i''.

The most frequent position for pronominal adjectives is before the noun.

====Demonstratives====
Demonstratives, such as ''ille'' ("that") and ''hic'' ("this"), almost always precede the noun in both in Caesar (99%) and in Cicero's speeches (95%).&lt;ref&gt;Walker (1918), p. 648.&lt;/ref&gt;

When it follows a noun in unemphatic position, ''hic'' can often mean "the aforementioned":&lt;ref&gt;D&amp;S, pp. 513–4.&lt;/ref&gt;
:''Gavius &lt;u&gt;hic&lt;/u&gt; quem dico Consanus''.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''Verr.'' 2.5.160.&lt;/ref&gt;
:"This Gavius of Consa that I am talking about."

:''status &lt;u&gt;hic&lt;/u&gt; non dolendi''.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''de Fin.'' 2.32.&lt;/ref&gt;
:"this state of freedom of pain (which we are discussing)"

In the same way, when it follows a noun, ''ille'' can sometimes mean "that famous":&lt;ref&gt;Ullman (1919), p. 417.&lt;/ref&gt;
:''marmorea Venus &lt;u&gt;illa&lt;/u&gt;''&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''Verr.'' 4.135&lt;/ref&gt;
:"&lt;u&gt;that famous&lt;/u&gt; marble statue of Venus"

But more frequently, even when it means "the aforementioned", and also when it means "this one here", ''hic'' will precede the noun:
:''&lt;u&gt;hoc&lt;/u&gt; nuntio''&lt;ref&gt;Caesar, ''B.G.'' 7.40.&lt;/ref&gt; 
:"with this news (just mentioned)"

:''&lt;u&gt;hic&lt;/u&gt; A. Licinius''&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''pro Arch.'' 1.&lt;/ref&gt;
:"this Aulus Licinius (whom you see here)"

====''alius'' and ''nullus''====
The pronouns ''alius'' "another", ''alter'' "another (of two)", ''ullus'' "any", and ''nullus'' "no", when used adjectivally, precede the noun in most cases (93% in both Caesar and Cicero).&lt;ref&gt;Walker (1918), p. 648.&lt;/ref&gt;

:''sine &lt;u&gt;ulla&lt;/u&gt; dubitatione'' 
:"without any hesitation"

:''&lt;u&gt;nullo&lt;/u&gt; modo''
:"in no way"

:''&lt;u&gt;alio&lt;/u&gt; loco''
"in another place"

:''illa &lt;u&gt;altera&lt;/u&gt; pars orationis'' 
:"that second part of the speech"

Occasionally, however, when emphatic, they may follow:

:''certe huic homini spes &lt;u&gt;nulla&lt;/u&gt; salutis esset.''&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''Verr.'' 2.3.168.&lt;/ref&gt;
:"Certainly this man would have no hope at all of being saved."

In the following, there is a [[chiasmus]] (ABBA order):

:''animus &lt;u&gt;alius&lt;/u&gt; ad alia vitia propensior''.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''Tusc.'' 4.81.&lt;/ref&gt;
:"Different minds are disposed towards different vices."

====''ipse''====
''Ipse'' in phrases such as ''ipse Alexander'' ("Alexander himself") usually precedes the noun in Caesar, as also in Cicero, although Cicero's preference is not as strong.&lt;ref&gt;Walker (1918), p. 650.&lt;/ref&gt;

====''quidam'' and ''aliquis''====
The word ''quidam'' "a certain" can either precede or follow its noun: 
:''quidam homo nobilis''&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''de Domo sua'' 111.&lt;/ref&gt;
:"a certain nobleman"

:''scriba quidam Cn. Flavius''&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''Murena'' 25.&lt;/ref&gt;
:"a certain scribe, by the name of Gnaeus Flavius"

When it is used with a person's name, it always follows, or else goes between forename and surname:
:''Epicrates quidam''&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''Verr.'' 2.2.53.&lt;/ref&gt;
:"a certain Epicrates"

:''Decimus quidam Verginius''&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''Rep.'' 2.63.&lt;/ref&gt;
:"a certain Decimus Verginius"

In such a position it is unemphatic, and the emphasis is on the name.

The other indefinite pronoun, ''aliqui'' (the adjectival form of ''aliquis''), similarly can either follow or precede its noun:
:''a Flamma, si non potes omne, partem &lt;u&gt;aliquam&lt;/u&gt; velim extorqueas''.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''Fam.'' 16.24.1.&lt;/ref&gt;
:"From Flamma, even if you can't get everything, at least I should  like you to extort some part of the money."

:''si non omnem at &lt;u&gt;aliquam&lt;/u&gt; partem maeroris sui deponeret''.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''Sest.'' 7.&lt;/ref&gt;
:"If not all, at least he should put aside some part of his grief"

Of these two, the phrase ''aliquam partem'' is slightly more common; and the phrase ''aliquo modo'' "somehow or other" is always in that order.&lt;ref&gt;Perseus PhiliLogic search.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stacked adjectives===
It is been noted that in various languages when more than one adjective precedes a noun, they tend to come in a particular order.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Flanagan (2014), [https://repository.edgehill.ac.uk/6167/1/Flanagan_Paul_-_Thesis_-_Input_-_Final_-_2014_03.pdf "A Cross-Linguistic Investigation of the Order of Attributive Adjectives"]. Edge Hill University PhD Thesis.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alexandra Teodorescu (2006), [http://www.lingref.com/cpp/wccfl/25/paper1473.pdf "Adjective Ordering Restrictions Revisited"]. ''Proceedings of the 25th West Coast Conference on Formal Linguistics'', ed. Donald Baumer, David Montero, and Michael Scanlon, 399-407.&lt;/ref&gt; In English the order usually given is: Determiner &gt; Number &gt; Opinion &gt; Size &gt; Quality &gt; Age &gt; Shape &gt; Colour &gt; Participle forms &gt; Origin &gt; Material &gt; Type &gt; Purpose (for example, "those two large brown Alsatian guard dogs").&lt;ref&gt;John Eastwoood (1994), ''Oxford Guide to English Grammar'', §202.&lt;/ref&gt; In general an adjective expressing a non-permanent state (such as "hot") will go further from the noun than an adjective of type or material which expresses an inherent property of the object.&lt;ref&gt;D&amp;S, p. 478.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Latin, when adjectives precede, they generally have the same order as in English:&lt;ref&gt;D&amp;S, pp. 476–81.&lt;/ref&gt;  
:''calida bubula urina'' 
:"warm cow urine"

:''virides pineas nuces''
:"green pine nuts"

:''multos formosos homines''
:"many handsome people".

When the adjectives follow, the opposite order is usually used:
:''patera aurea gravis''
:"a heavy gold dish"

:''ovum gallinaceum coctum''
:"a cooked hen's egg"

:''epigramma Graecum pernobile''
:"a famous Greek inscription"

There are some apparent exceptions, however, such as the following, in which the adjective ''sumptuosam'' "luxurious" is placed next to the noun:&lt;ref&gt;D&amp;S p. 481.&lt;/ref&gt;

:''nullam suburbanam aut maritimam sumptuosam villam'' 
:"no suburban or sea-side luxurious villa"&lt;ref&gt;Nepos ''Att.'' 14.3.&lt;/ref&gt;

The demonstrative ''hic'' "this" normally goes before a number, as in English. However, the reverse order is also possible:&lt;ref&gt;D&amp;S, p. 497.&lt;/ref&gt;

:''in &lt;u&gt;his tribus&lt;/u&gt; urbibus'' 
:"in these three cities"&lt;ref&gt;Livy, 10.45.11.&lt;/ref&gt;

:''una ex &lt;u&gt;tribus his&lt;/u&gt; rebus'' 
:"one of these three things"&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''de Orat.'' 2.310.&lt;/ref&gt;

When ''hic'' follows a noun, it goes close to it:&lt;ref&gt;D&amp;S, p. 516.&lt;/ref&gt;
:''avus &lt;u&gt;hic&lt;/u&gt; tuus'' 
:"this grandfather of yours/your grandfather here"

:''vitam &lt;u&gt;hanc&lt;/u&gt; rusticam'' 
:"this country life"

Adjectives of the same semantic class are usually joined by a conjunction in Latin:&lt;ref&gt;D&amp;S, pp. 477, 473.&lt;/ref&gt;

:''aquam bonam et liquidam'' 
:"good clear water"

:''nationes multae atque magnae''
:"many great nations"

Quite commonly also, one adjective precedes and another follows, as in:

:''eruditissimos homines Asiaticos'' 
:"very learned Asiatic men"

===Preposition, adjective, noun===
When a preposition, adjective and noun are used together, this order is the most common one (75% of Caesar's examples):&lt;ref&gt;Walker (1918), p. 648.&lt;/ref&gt;

:''ex humili loco ad summam dignitatem''&lt;ref&gt;Caesar, ''B.G.'' 7.39.1.&lt;/ref&gt;
:"from a humble position to the highest dignity"

More rarely, a monosyllabic preposition may come between an adjective and noun in [[hyperbaton]]:
:''hac de causa''&lt;ref&gt;Caesar, ''B.C.'' 1.82, 5.&lt;/ref&gt;
:"for this reason"

:''magno cum fremitu et clamore''&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''Att.'' 2.19.2&lt;/ref&gt;
:"with a great deal of noise and shouting"

However, this is mainly true only of the prepositions ''cum'', ''de'', ''ex'', and ''in'' and mainly with interrogatives and relatives and a limited number of adjectives.&lt;ref&gt;Walker (1918), p. 651.&lt;/ref&gt;

The order preposition, noun, adjective is also less common:
:''ad bellum Parthicum''&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''Att.'' 6.1.3.&lt;/ref&gt;
:"to the war against the Parthians"

==Genitive position==
===Possessive genitive===
Just as with adjectives, a [[Genitive case|genitive]] such as ''hostium'' "of the enemies" can either precede or follow its head-noun. Thus for "camp of the enemies", both ''castra &lt;u&gt;hostium&lt;/u&gt;'' and ''&lt;u&gt;hostium&lt;/u&gt; castra'' are found. Overall, however, there is a slight tendency for a genitive to come after a noun in both Caesar and Cicero (57% of examples).&lt;ref&gt;Walker (1918), p. 648.&lt;/ref&gt;

Individual preferences play a part in genitive position. In Livy books 1–10, ''castra hostium'' "the camp of the enemies" (74% of examples) is more common than ''hostium castra''.&lt;ref&gt;Perseus PhiloLogic search.&lt;/ref&gt; Caesar, on the other hand, seems to prefer ''hostium castra'' (69% of examples).&lt;ref&gt;D&amp;S, p. 365.&lt;/ref&gt; But when a name is used with ''castra'', Caesar usually puts it after the noun (86% of examples), for example ''castra Labieni'' "Labienus's camp".&lt;ref&gt;D&amp;S, p. 363.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relationship terms===
With relationship terms, such as ''uxor'' "wife", the genitive can go either before or after the noun. Often when it follows, the genitive is unemphatic:&lt;ref&gt;D&amp;S, p. 356.&lt;/ref&gt;

:''patruus &lt;u&gt;pueri&lt;/u&gt;'' 
:"the boy's uncle" (referring to a previously mentioned boy).

Often (but not always) when the genitive precedes, it is focussed:&lt;ref&gt;D&amp;S, p. 358.&lt;/ref&gt;

:''&lt;u&gt;Rosci&lt;/u&gt; fuit discipulus'' 
:"he was a pupil of Roscius".

One noun which almost always has a preceding genitive is ''filius/filia'' "son/daughter":&lt;ref&gt;D&amp;S, p. 352.&lt;/ref&gt;

:''Pericles &lt;u&gt;Xanthippi&lt;/u&gt; filius''
:"Pericles son of Xanthippus".

===Objective genitive===
When the genitive is an objective one, e.g. ''spem victoriae'' "hope of victory" or ''conservatorem Asiae'' "the saviour of Asia", it normally follows the noun. However, considerations of focus or emphasis can cause it to precede:&lt;ref&gt;D&amp;S, p. 349.&lt;/ref&gt;

:''&lt;u&gt;rerum&lt;/u&gt; auctores, non fabularum'' 
:"authors of &lt;u&gt;facts&lt;/u&gt;, not of fables".

===Subjective genitive===
Subjective genitives can precede or follow the noun. For example, with ''memoria'' "memory", a subjective genitive usually (but not always) precedes:&lt;ref&gt;D&amp;S, p. 317.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
:''hominum memoria'' 
:"in people's memory".

However, with ''spes'' "hope", a subjective genitive usually follows, unless focussed:&lt;ref&gt;D&amp;S, p. 317.&lt;/ref&gt;

:''spem Catilinae'' 
:"Catiline's hope".

If a phrase has both a subjective and objective genitive, the subjective one (whether it comes before or after the noun) will usually precede the objective one:&lt;ref&gt;D&amp;S, p. 316.&lt;/ref&gt;

:''in desperatione &lt;u&gt;omnium&lt;/u&gt; salutis'' 
:"in &lt;u&gt;everyone's&lt;/u&gt; despair of being saved".

===Partitive genitive===
Partitive genitives usually follow the noun:&lt;ref&gt;D&amp;S, pp.368–376.&lt;/ref&gt;
:''magna pars &lt;u&gt;militum&lt;/u&gt;''.&lt;ref&gt;Caesar, ''B.G.'' 5.30.1&lt;/ref&gt; 
:"the majority of the soldiers"

:''magnus numerus &lt;u&gt;hostium&lt;/u&gt;''.&lt;ref&gt;Caesar, ''B.G.'' 5.34.&lt;/ref&gt;
:"a large number of enemies"

However, the genitive can also sometimes precede, especially if it is a topic or sub-topic:&lt;ref&gt;D&amp;S, p. 370.&lt;/ref&gt;
:''&lt;u&gt;equitatus&lt;/u&gt; magnam partem ... praemisit'' "he sent the majority of the cavalry on ahead"&lt;ref&gt;Caesar, ''B.C.'' 3.38.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Adjective, genitive, noun===
Another place a genitive is often found is between an adjective and the head-noun, especially when the adjective is an emphatic one such as ''omnis'' "all":&lt;ref&gt;D&amp;S, p. 371.&lt;/ref&gt;

:''ex omnibus &lt;u&gt;urbis&lt;/u&gt; partibus''.&lt;ref&gt;Caesar, ''B.G.'' 7.47.&lt;/ref&gt; 
:"from all parts of the city"
 
:''magnas &lt;u&gt;Gallorum&lt;/u&gt; copias''&lt;ref&gt;Caesar, ''B.G.'' 5.53; D&amp;S, p. 366.&lt;/ref&gt; 
:"large forces of Gauls"

This also applies when a participle is used instead of an adjective:&lt;ref&gt;D&amp;S, p. 366.&lt;/ref&gt;
  
:''productis &lt;u&gt;Romanorum&lt;/u&gt; copiis''.&lt;ref&gt;Caesar, ''B.G.'' 3.24.&lt;/ref&gt;
:"the forces of the Romans having been led out".

The orders Adjective-Noun-Genitive and Adjective-Genitive-Noun are both common in Caesar and Cicero; but Genitive-Adjective-Noun is infrequent.&lt;ref&gt;Walker (1918), p. 648.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Enclitic words==
===Typical enclitic words===
There are certain words that are [[clitic|enclitic]], that is to say, they always follow a stronger word. Typical of these are ''enim'' "for", ''autem'' "however, moreover", and ''vero'' "indeed", which virtually always come after the first full word of the sentence (not counting prepositions), never first.&lt;ref&gt;Spevak (2010), p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;
:''est enim profectus in Hispaniam''.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''Fam.'' 7.23.4.&lt;/ref&gt;
:"for he has set out for Spain"

:''de morte enim ita sentit...''&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''Tusc.'' 5.88.&lt;/ref&gt;
:"for his view of death is the following..."

:''Quintus enim Ligarius...".&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''pro Lig.'' 2.&lt;/ref&gt;
:"indeed Quintus Ligarius..."

Other words which require a stronger word to lean on are ''quoque'' "also" and ''quidem'' "indeed". These can never begin a sentence, therefore.&lt;ref&gt;D&amp;S, p. 275.&lt;/ref&gt; Other words, such as ''fere'' "approximately" and ''etiam'', are frequently enclitic:

:''media fere nocte''
:"around the middle of the night"

In the phrase ''ne ... quidem'' "not even", the word ''quidem'' generally follows the first word of the emphasised phrase, rather than the whole phrase:&lt;ref&gt;D&amp;S, p. 271.&lt;/ref&gt;

:''ne deos quidem immortalis''.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''de Prov.'' 14.&lt;/ref&gt;
:"not even the immortal gods"

:''ne homines quidem probi''.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''de Div.'' 2.54.&lt;/ref&gt;
:"not even decent people"

===Weak pronouns===
Personal pronouns such as ''me'' "me" and ''mihi'' "to me" can have weak and strong forms in Latin. When weak they tend to be found early in the sentence, either after the first word (which can be a conjunction such as ''cum'' "when" or ''et'' "and") or after an enclitic such as ''enim'', if present:&lt;ref&gt;D&amp;S, pp. 277–292.&lt;/ref&gt;
:''interim venit Philotimus et &lt;u&gt;mihi a te&lt;/u&gt; litteras reddidit.''&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''Att.'' 10.11.1.&lt;/ref&gt;
:"Meanwhile Philotimus has just come and given me a letter from you."

:''hoc enim &lt;u&gt;sibi&lt;/u&gt; Staienus cognomen ... delegerat.''&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''Clu.'' 72.&lt;/ref&gt;
:"for this was the surname which Staienus had chosen for himself"

:''duas &lt;u&gt;sibi&lt;/u&gt; hereditates venisse arbitratus est''.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''Verr.'' 2.1.90.&lt;/ref&gt;
:"He considered that two inheritances had come to him."

Contrast sentences like the following, where the indirect object is a full noun, and follows the direct object (which according to Devine and Stephens is the neutral word order):&lt;ref&gt;D&amp;S, p. 281.&lt;/ref&gt;
:''quia obsides &lt;u&gt;Larisaeis&lt;/u&gt; dederant''.&lt;ref&gt;Livy 42.53.7.&lt;/ref&gt;
:"because they had given hostages to the Larisaeans"

Unlike true enclitics, however, pronouns can also sometimes begin a sentence:&lt;ref&gt;D&amp;S, p. 280.&lt;/ref&gt;
:''&lt;u&gt;ei&lt;/u&gt; statim rescripsi''.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''Att.'' 8.1.2.&lt;/ref&gt;
:"I wrote back to him at once."

As with the copula ''est'' (see above), when a focus phrase or emphatic delayed topic phrase intervenes, the weak pronoun will usually follow that, rather than the first word of the sentence:&lt;ref&gt;D&amp;S, p. 295.&lt;/ref&gt;
:''aliud enim vocis genus iracundia &lt;u&gt;sibi&lt;/u&gt; sumat''.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''de Orat.'' 3.217.&lt;/ref&gt;
:"Anger assumes for itself a different tone of voice."

However, sometimes the pronoun will be found in second position, leaving ''est'' to follow the focussed phrase:&lt;ref&gt;D&amp;S, 299.&lt;/ref&gt;
:''nunc &lt;u&gt;mihi&lt;/u&gt; tertius ille locus &lt;u&gt;est&lt;/u&gt; relictus orationis.'' (Cicero, ''pro Mur.'' 54)
:"Now what remains of my speech is that third topic."

And in the following example, the pronoun follows not the focussed word, but the conjunction ''si'' "if":&lt;ref&gt;D&amp;S, p. 303.&lt;/ref&gt;
:''haec si &lt;u&gt;tibi&lt;/u&gt; tuus parens diceret...''.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''Verr.'' 2.5.138.&lt;/ref&gt;
:"If your father were saying ''this'' to you..."

In terms of transformational grammar, the sentence can be analysed as being derived from *''si tuus parens haec tibi diceret'' by raising ''haec'' and ''tibi'' to earlier in the sentence. A functionalist, on the other hand, would say that ''haec'' naturally comes first as the topic, then ''si'' in its normal place, then the unemphatic pronoun, without anything being moved.

'''Marek Jan Siemek''' (November 27, 1942 &amp;ndash; May 30, 2011) was a Polish philosopher and historian of German [[transcendental philosophy]] ([[German idealism]]). He was a professor at the [[Institute of Philosophy, University of Warsaw|Institute of Philosophy]] of the [[University of Warsaw]] and the director of its Department of Social Philosophy.&lt;ref name="publication1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nowakrytyka.pl/spip.php?article170&amp;var_mode=calcul|title=Hegel i różnica epistemologiczna|language=Polish|accessdate=19 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marek Siemek was a disciple of [[Bronisław Baczko]], one of the main representatives of the [[Warsaw School of the History of Ideas]]. In his early works Siemek interprets [[marxism]] as a form of [[transcendental philosophy]]. In his later works ha abandons marxism for [[hegelianism]] interpreted as transcendental social philosophy.

From 1986 member of International Advisory Committee of [[The Internationale Hegel-Gesellschaft]]. Fellow of [[Collegium Invisibile]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ci.edu.pl/index.php?id=tutorzy&amp;kat=Czlonkowie |title=List of Fellows |publisher=ci.edu.pl |accessdate=25 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 10 February 2006 he received doctorate ''honoris causa'' of the [[University of Bonn]].

Marek Siemek had one son, currently residing in the United States.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21490">'''New legal realism''' ('''NLR''') is an emerging school of thought in American [[legal philosophy]].

Although it draws on the older [[legal realism]] from the first half of the twentieth century, new legal realism differs in important ways.  Notably, it moves beyond the older field’s emphasis on judges, courts, and formal legal systems.  New legal realism examines [[law]] in people’s everyday lives, using an [[interdisciplinary]] combination of current social science methods, including qualitative, quantitative, and experimental approaches.  It is characterized by a “ground-level up” perspective, which focuses on laypeople’s experiences with law as well as studying legal professionals and formal institutions. Research methods are chosen according to evolving research questions, responding to changing understandings as knowledge accumulates.  This and other features of NLR fit well with the American [[pragmatism|pragmatist]] philosophical tradition. Some NLR scholars&lt;ref name="nourse and shaffer"&gt;Nourse, Victoria, and Gregory Shaffer. ''Varieties of New Legal Realism: Can a New World Order Prompt a New Legal Theory?'' Cornell Law Review 95:62 (2009)&lt;/ref&gt; view their pragmatist approach as a way of bridging between more objective social science (describing how it "is') and more normative policy goals (how it "ought" to be).

In addition, NLR takes “law on the books” seriously as a subject of study, including it as part of the overall system of law.  The goal of NLR is to build an integrated social science research program on law that combines multiple methods and objects of study to give policymakers the most complete possible picture of how law operates.  This includes non-instrumental uses of law.  Some NLR scholars have focused on how to create the best translations of social science for law, based on the idea that law has its own priorities and special language that have to be taken into account (in addition to the technical and field-specific languages and approaches of the social sciences, which also create translation challenges of their own)(see, for example, the original LSI &lt;ref name="Law &amp; Social Inquiry"&gt;Law &amp; Social Inquiry ''New Legal Realism Symposium'' 2006(4)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Wisconsin Law Review]]&lt;ref name="Wisconsin Law Review"&gt;Wisconsin Law Review ''New Legal Realism Symposium'' 2005(2)&lt;/ref&gt; symposia, and also subsequent NLR publications&lt;ref name="Suchman and Mertz"&gt;Suchman, Mark and Mertz, Elizabeth (2010) "Toward a New Legal Empiricism: Empirical Legal Studies and New Legal Realism" Annual Review of Law and Social Science December 2010, Vol. 6, No. 1: 555-579&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dagan"&gt;Dagan, Hanoch (2013) Reconstructing American Legal Realism &amp; Rethinking Private Law Theory Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;).

==History==

The first New Legal Realist Conference held in North America took place in Madison, Wisconsin in June 2004.  The Conference was jointly funded by the [[American Bar Foundation]], an independent social science research institute in Chicago, and the [[University of Wisconsin Law School]]’s Institute for Legal Studies, a center for interdisciplinary research on law.  Scholars from these two institutions as well as from [[Harvard Law School]] and [[Emory Law School]] held initial meetings to plan for the conference.

Prior to this conference, several different strands of new legal realist thought were emerging in the U.S. legal and sociolegal academic communities.  In 1997, a group of scholars sponsored a panel entitled “Is It Time for a New Legal Realism?” at the 1997 [[Law and Society Association]] Meetings in St. Louis, Missouri.  The panel drew a large audience of sociolegal researchers, who debated the issues involved in achieving high-quality translations of [[qualitative research|qualitative]] and [[Quantitative data|quantitative]] empirical research in legal settings.  One particular topic of discussion was the sometimes difficult relationship between scholarly traditions in the social sciences and in the legal academy.  This strand of new legal realist thought led to the Madison conference, and to the first collaborative publication of research by a peer-reviewed social science journal (''[[Law &amp; Social Inquiry]]'') &lt;ref name="Law &amp; Social Inquiry"/&gt;  and a student-edited law review ([[Wisconsin Law Review]]).&lt;ref name="Wisconsin Law Review"/&gt;  These two publications examined problems such as poverty, globalization, and discrimination from the combined perspectives of law and social science, focusing on developing better methods for interdisciplinary translation.

Also in 1997, political scientist Frank Cross published an article entitled “Political Science and the New Legal Realism” &lt;ref name="cross"&gt;Cross, Frank B. ''Political Science and the New Legal Realism:  A Case of Unfortunate Interdisciplinary Ignorance.''  Northwestern University Law Review 92:251 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; and legal philosopher Brian Tamanaha wrote a book on pragmatism and “realistic socio-legal theory”&lt;ref name="tamanaha"&gt;Tamanaha, Brian. ''Realistic Socio-Legal Theory:  Pragmatism and a Social Theory of Law.'' Oxford:  Oxford University Press, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; The strand of new legal realist thought that originated with Cross examines judicial behavior using quantitative methods.  Tamanaha is concerned with bringing the philosophical foundations provided by pragmatist theory to bear on sociolegal research.

==Scholarship and events==

Since 1997, there have been numerous events and publications focusing on New Legal Realism.  After the initial NLR conference in 2004, subsequent NLR conferences have focused on methodology, on the relationship between empirical research and legal theory, on legal approaches to poverty and land ownership, on the legal treatment of gender-related issues in employment, and on statutory interpretation.   NLR scholarship has been presented in panels at the annual meetings of the [[Association of American Law Schools]] and the Law &amp; Society Association.  NLR scholars were active in forming a collaborative research network, supported by the Law and Society Association, focusing on “Realist and Empirical Legal Methods.”

New legal realist scholars utilize empirical methodologies to examine discrimination, judicial decision making, global law, and other topics (see Further Readings section below).  In the United States, several strands of New Legal Realism have been identified.,.&lt;ref name="nourse and shaffer"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Suchman and Mertz" /&gt; In particular, one dominant strand of the US New Legal Realist literature calls for a "bottom up" approach in which scholars pay attention to law on the ground, in everyday lives, using qualitative as well as quantitative methods.  In 2005, Erlanger et al. called for using "bottom up" as well as "top down" empirical research.&lt;ref name="erlanger et al."&gt;Erlanger, Howard, et al.''Is It Time for a New Legal Realism?'' Wisconsin Law Review 2005: 339 (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; Early symposia in US New Legal Realism demonstrated their "bottom up" approach by presenting actual examples of this kind of research in areas such as discrimination law and its effects in actual life, globalization and law, and law practice. By contrast, another strand proceeds using a more exclusively "top down" approach, focusing on courts and judicial opinions, and generally using quantitative methods.  Scholars in Scandinavia are also returning to an interest in legal realism, building on their own earlier legal realist tradition.&lt;ref name="bjarup"&gt;Bjarup, Jes.  ''The Philosophy of Scandinavian Legal Realism'' Ratio Juris 18:1-15 (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2012, the first European conference on new legal realism was held in Copenhagen, bringing together an international group of scholars from a variety of disciplines.  The conference was organized by Jakob v. H. Holtermann, Mikael Rask Madsen, and Henrik Palmer Olsen.  In 2014, the [http://www.law.uci.edu/events/legal-history/NLR-Conference-Program-2014.pdf 10th Anniversary U.S. NLR Conference] was held at the [[University of California, Irvine School of Law|University of California-Irvine Law School]].

{{Sri Aurobindo}}
'''Nolini Kanta Gupta''' (13 January 1889 – 7 February 1983) was a revolutionary, linguist, scholar, critic, poet, philosopher and yogi, and the most senior of [[Sri Aurobindo]]'s disciples. He was born in [[Faridpur District|Faridpur]], East Bengal, to a cultured and prosperous Vaidya-Brahmin family. While in his teens he came under the influence of Sri Aurobindo, then a well known revolutionary fighting for independence against the British. When in his fourth year at [[Presidency College, Kolkata|Presidency College, Calcutta]], he left a promising academic career and rejected a lucrative government job to join a small revolutionary group under Sri Aurobindo. In May 1908 he was among those arrested for conspiracy in the [[Alipore bomb case]]. Acquitted a year later, after having spent a year in jail, he worked as a sub-editor for the ''Dharma'' and the ''Karmayogin'', two of Sri Aurobindo's Nationalist newspapers, in 1909 and 1910.

He was taught Greek, Latin, French and Italian by Sri Aurobindo himself and was among the four disciples who were with Aurobindo in 1910 at [[Pondicherry (city)|Pondicherry]]. When the [[Sri Aurobindo Ashram]] was founded in 1926, he settled permanently in Pondicherry serving the Mother and Sri Aurobindo as secretary of the ashram and later as one of its trustees. A prolific writer on a wide range of topics, he has about 60 books to his credit of which about 16 are in English and 44 in Bengali, as well as many articles and poems in English, Bengali and French.

Nolini Kanta Gupta died at the Sri Aurobindo Ashram on 7 February 1984.

==Early life==

Pandurang Vaijnath Athavale was born on 19 October 1920 in Chittapavan Bramhin Family  in the village of [[Roha]] in [[Maharashtra]] (Konkan), [[India]]. He was one of five children born to the Sanskrit teacher Vaijanath Shastri Athavale and his wife Parvati Athavale.&lt;ref name=raf/&gt;

When Athavale was twelve years old, his grandfather set up an independent course of study for the young boy. Thus, Athavale was taught in a system very similar to that of the [[Tapovan]] system of ancient India. In 1942, he started to give discourses at the ''Srimad Bhagavad Gita Pathshala,Madhavbaug,Mumbai", a center set up by his father in 1926.&lt;ref name=raf/&gt;

Athavale read diligently in the Royal Asiatic Library for a period of 14 years; at a young age, he was well-known to have read every piece of non-fiction literature (ranging from Marx's philosophy to Whitehead's writings to ancient Indian philosophy). In 1954, he attended the Second World Philosophers' Conference, held in Japan. There, Athavale presented the concepts of Vedic ideals and the teachings of the Bhagavad Gita. Many participants were impressed by his ideas but wanted evidence of such ideals being put into practice in India. Nobel Prize–winning physicist Dr. Arthur Holly Compton was particularly enchanted with Athavale's ideas and offered him a lucrative opportunity in the United States, where he could spread his ideas. Athavale politely declined,&lt;ref name=raf&gt;[http://www.rmaf.org.ph/Awardees/Biography/BiographyAthavalePan.htm Biography] ''[[Ramon Magsaysay Award]]'' website.&lt;/ref&gt; saying that he had much to accomplish in his native India, where he planned to demonstrate to the world a model community peacefully practicing and spreading Vedic thoughts and the message of the Bhagavad Gita.

[[Swadhyaya Parivar]] established itself in [[India]] in 1978 with adherents meeting every Sunday, where prayers were sung and a video recording of Athavale was played.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Diwanji|first1=Amberish K.|title=Applause and abuse as Athavale is awarded the Templeton prize|url=http://www.rediff.com/news/may/08swad.htm|accessdate=2 May 2017|work=Rediff.com|date=8 May 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; Swadhyaya, which closely  translate to "in depth study of the self" is a process based upon Vedic philosophy, and the members of the Parivar are called "Swadhyayees". Over the years, Athavale's followers have taken the Bhagawad Gita's concepts of Indwelling God and God's universal love, to millions of people: transcending caste, socioeconomic barriers, and religious differences. Rev. Athavale personally visited tens of thousands of villages (on foot and rented bicycles), and his adherents have followed suit to roughly 100,000 villages across India, and at least 34 nations across the globe. In these villages, Rev. Athavale started various experiments (Prayogs) to impart social activism by means of a god-centric devotion, including cooperative farming, fishing and tree-planting projects in the spirit of collective, divine labor (bhakti), somewhat similar to the [[Antigonish Movement|Antigonish movement]] in Canada. Swadhyayees aim to fulfill Rev. Athavale's vision of eradicating the world's problems by creating a global family united under the principle of a universal blood maker. He felt that the universality of the Bhagavad Gita allows for it to a guide to all of humanity. As such, it's thoughts should reach unto the last person. Today, the millions of adherents can be found on every habitable continent in over 35 countries including the Caribbean, Americas, Asia, Europe, Australia, New Zealand, Middle East and Africa. It is the Swadhyaya Parivar's mission to complete Rev. Athavale's vision of a ''"Universal Brotherhood under the Divine Fatherhood of God."''&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9902E3DB1230F935A35750C0A961958260 Leader of Spiritual Movement Wins $1.2 Million Religion Prize] ''[[New York Times]]'', 6 March 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==

'''Patrick Lancaster Gardiner'''  (1922–1997) was a British academic [[philosopher]], a Fellow of [[Magdalen College, Oxford]].

==Biography==

Gardiner was born in [[Chelsea, London]], on 17 March 1922. His father was  [[Clive Gardiner]], a landscape artist and principal of [[Goldsmiths College]]; his mother was  [[Lilian Lancaster]], an artist and a pupil of [[Walter Sickert]]. His paternal grandfather was  [[Alfred George Gardiner]], editor of ''[[The Daily News (UK)|The Daily News]]''. His younger brother was the architect [[Stephen Gardiner (architect)|Stephen Gardiner]]. He was educated at [[Westminster School]], and then received a First in history from [[Christ Church, Oxford]]. After Army service in Italy, North Africa and Austria, he returned to Oxford for a second B.A., in PPE ([[politics, philosophy and economics]]).

He was appointed to [[Wadham College, Oxford]] (1949), and then [[St Antony's College, Oxford]] (1952). His first published book was ''The Nature of Historical Explanation'' in 1952 In 1958 he became a Fellow of Magdalen College, where he remained, becoming an Emeritus Fellow in 1989.

He married Susan Booth (1934–2006) in 1955, and had two daughters.

==Academic work==
He is best known for his studies of [[Schopenhauer]] published in 1963 and [[Kierkegaard]] in 1988.

According to his obituary in ''The Times''  by Richard Wollheim,   his most important contribution to philosophy was to reawaken interest in German Idealism at a time (the 1960s) when it was largely neglected in British philosophy departments. His books on Schopenhauer and Kierkegaard were  "models of how to respect the extremity of an author's thinking without condoning it" and "recaptured a whole philosophical terrain for the sophisticated reader"&lt;ref&gt;. Obituary, The Times,  June 27, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Philippa Ruth Foot''', [[Fellow of the British Academy|FBA]] ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|f|ɪ||l|ɪ|p|ə|_|ˈ|f|ʊ|t}}; née '''Bosanquet'''; 3 October 1920{{spaced ndash}} 3 October 2010) was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Philosophy|philosopher]]. She was one of the founders of contemporary [[virtue ethics]], inspired by the ethics of [[Aristotle]]. Her later career marked a significant change in view from her work in the 1950s and 1960s, and may be seen as an attempt to modernize [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] ethical theory, to show that it is adaptable to a contemporary world view, and thus, that it could compete with such popular theories as modern [[deontology|deontological]] and [[utilitarianism|utilitarian]] ethics.  Some of her work was crucial in the re-emergence of [[normative ethics]] within [[analytic philosophy]], especially her critique of [[consequentialism]] and of [[non-cognitivism]]. A familiar example is the continuing discussion of an example of hers referred to as the [[trolley problem]].&lt;ref name="Philippa Foot 1978"&gt;Philippa Foot, ''[http://www2.econ.iastate.edu/classes/econ362/hallam/Readings/FootDoubleEffect.pdf The Problem of Abortion and the Doctrine of the Double Effect]'' in ''Virtues and Vices'' (Oxford: Basil Blackwell, 1978) (originally appeared in the ''Oxford Review'', Number 5, 1967.)&lt;/ref&gt; Foot's approach was influenced by the later work of [[Wittgenstein]], although she rarely dealt explicitly with materials treated by him. She was the granddaughter of American President [[Grover Cleveland]].

==Personal life and education==
Born as '''Philippa Ruth Bosanquet''', Foot was the daughter of [[Esther Cleveland]] (1893–1980) and Captain William Sidney Bence Bosanquet (1893–1966) of the [[Coldstream Guards]] of the [[British Army]].  Her paternal grandfather was the barrister and judge, Sir [[Frederick Albert Bosanquet]], [[Common Serjeant of London]] from 1900 to 1917. Her maternal grandfather was the [[List of Presidents of the United States|22nd and 24th]] President of the United States, [[Grover Cleveland]].

Foot was educated privately and at [[Somerville College, Oxford]], 1939–42, where she obtained a first class in Philosophy, Politics and Economics ('PPE'). Her association with Somerville, interrupted only by government service as an economist from 1942 to 1947, continued for the rest of her life. She was a lecturer in Philosophy, 1947–50, fellow and tutor, 1950–69, senior research fellow, 1969–88, and honorary fellow, 1988–2010. She spent many hours there in debate with [[G.E.M. Anscombe]], who persuaded her that [[non-cognitivism]] was misguided.

In the 1960s and 1970s Foot held a number of visiting professorships in the United States – at Cornell, MIT, Berkeley, City University of New York. She was appointed Griffin Professor of Philosophy at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]], in 1976 and taught there until 1991, dividing her time between the United States and England.

Contrary to common belief, Foot was not a founder of [[Oxfam]] and joined the organization about 6 years after its foundation. She was an [[atheist]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hcs.harvard.edu/~hrp/issues/2003/Foot.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
She was once married to the historian [[M. R. D. Foot]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eilenberg|first=Susan|title=With A, then B, then C|journal=London Review of Books|volume=24|issue=17|date=5 September 2002|pages=3–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and at one time shared a flat with the novelist [[Iris Murdoch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Grimes|first=William|title=Philippa Foot, Renowned Philosopher, Dies at 90|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/10/us/10foot.html?_r=0|accessdate=25 April 2014|newspaper=The New York Times|date=9 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; She died in 2010, on her 90th birthday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/oct/05/philippa-foot-obituary|title=Philippa Foot obituary|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|date=5 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Critique of non-cognitivism ==
Foot's works of the late 1950s were [[meta-ethics|meta-ethical]] in character: that is, they pertained to the status of moral judgment and speech. The essays "Moral Arguments" and "Moral Beliefs", in particular, were crucial in overturning the rule of [[non-cognitivism]] in analytic approaches to ethical theory in the preceding decades.

The non-cognitivist approach may already be found in [[David Hume|Hume]], but it was given its most influential analytic formulations in works of [[Alfred Ayer|A. J. Ayer]], [[C. L. Stevenson]], and [[R. M. Hare]]. These writers focused on so-called "thin ethical concepts" such as "good" and "bad" and "right" and "wrong," arguing that they are not employed to affirm something true of the thing in question, but rather, to express an emotion or (in Hare's case) an imperative.

This sort of analysis of "thin" ethical concepts was tied to a special partitioning account of more concrete or "thick" concepts, such as "cowardly", "cruel", or "gluttonous." These were supposed to combine a non-cognitive "evaluative" element with the obvious, "merely descriptive" element.

Foot's purpose was to criticize this distinction and the underlying account of thin concepts. Because of the particular way she approached the defense of the cognitive and truth-evaluable character of moral judgment, these essays were crucial in bringing the question of the [[rationality]] of [[morality]] to the fore.

Practical considerations involving "thick" ethical concepts – ''but it would be cruel'', ''it would be cowardly'', ''it's hers'', or ''I promised her I wouldn't'' – move people to act one way rather than another, but they are as descriptive as any other judgment pertaining to human life. They differ from thought such as ''it would be done on a Tuesday'' or ''it would take about three gallons of paint'', not by the admixture of what she considers to be any non-factual, attitude-expressing "moral" element, but by the fact that human beings have reasons not to do things that are cowardly or cruel.

Her lifelong devotion to this question appears in all periods of her work.

== The rationality of morality ==

=== "Why be moral?" – early works ===
It is on this question – the "why be moral?" question (which for her may be said to divide into the questions "why be just?", "why be temperate?", etc.) – that her doctrine underwent a surprising series of reversals. In "Moral Beliefs," she had argued that the received virtues – courage, temperance, justice, and so on – are cultivated rationally, and that it was thus rational to act in accordance with them. The "thick" ethical concepts that she emphasized (without using this expression) in her defense of the cognitive character of moral judgment were associated with such rationally cultivated traits, i.e. virtues; this is how they differ from randomly chosen descriptions of action. The crucial point was that the difference between "just action" and "action performed on Tuesday" (for example) was not a matter of "emotive" meaning, as in Ayer and Stevenson, or a secret imperatival feature, as in Hare.

=== "Why be moral?" – middle works ===
Fifteen years later, in the essay "Morality as a System of Hypothetical Imperatives", she reversed this when it came to justice and benevolence, that is, the virtues that especially regard other people. Although everyone has reason to cultivate courage, temperance and prudence, whatever the person desires or values, still, the rationality of just and benevolent acts must, she thought, turn on contingent motivations.  Although many found the thesis shocking, on her (then) account, it is meant to be, in a certain respect, inspiring: in a famous reinterpretation of a remark of Kant,&lt;ref&gt;[[Critique of Practical Reason]], [[s:Critique of Practical Reason#CHAPTER III. Of the Motives of Pure Practical Reason|Book 1, Chapter 3]], "[W]e pretend with fanciful pride to set ourselves above the thought of duty, like volunteers.... [B]ut yet we are subjects in it, not the sovereign,"&lt;/ref&gt; she says that "we are not conscripts in the army of virtue, but volunteers";&lt;ref&gt;Virtues and Vices, p. 170&lt;/ref&gt; the fact that we have nothing to say in proof of the irrationality of at least some unjust people should not alarm us in our own defense and cultivation of justice and benevolence: "it did not strike the citizens of Leningrad that their devotion to the city and its people during the terrible years of the siege was contingent".

=== "Why be moral?" – later work ===
Her book ''Natural Goodness'' attempts a different line. The question what we have most reason to do, is tied to the idea of the good working of practical reason. This, in turn, is tied to the idea of the species of an animal as providing a measure of good and bad in the operations of its parts and faculties. Just as one has to know what kind of animal one is dealing with in order, for instance, to decide whether its eyesight is good or bad, the question of whether a subject's practical reason is well developed, depends on the kind of animal it is. (This idea is developed in the light of a conception of animal kinds or species as implicitly containing "evaluative" content, which may be criticized on contemporary biological grounds; although it is arguable, even on that basis, that it is very deeply entrenched in human cognition.) In our case, what makes for a well-constituted practical reason, depends on the fact that we are human beings characterized by certain possibilities of emotion and desire, a certain anatomy, neurological organization, and so forth.

Once this step is made, it becomes possible to argue for the rationality of moral considerations in a new way. Humans begin with the conviction that justice is a genuine virtue. Thus, the conviction that the well-constituted human practical reason operates with considerations of justice, means that ''taking account of other people in that sort of way'' is "how human beings live together." (The thought that this is how they live must be understood in a sense that is compatible with the fact that actual individuals often do not – just as dentists understand the thought that "human beings have n teeth" in a way that is compatible with many people having fewer).  There is nothing incoherent in the thought that practical calculation that takes account of others and their good might characterize some kind of rational and social animal.

Similarly, of course, there is nothing incoherent in the idea of a form of rational life within which such considerations are alien; where they can only be imposed by damaging and disturbing the individual person. There is nothing analytic about the rationality of justice and benevolence. Rather, human conviction that justice is a virtue and that considerations of justice are genuine reasons for action, is the conviction that the kind of rational being that we are, namely, human beings, is of the first type. There is no reason to think such a kind of rational animality is impossible, so there is no reason to suspect that considerations of justice are frauds.

Of course, it might be suggested that this is precisely not the case, that human beings are of the second kind, and thus that the justice and benevolence we esteem are artificial and false. Foot would hold that considerations of machismo and lady-likeness are artificial and false; they are matters of "mere convention," which tend to put one off of the main things. That being how it is with justice, was the position of the Platonic "immoralists" Callicles and Thrasymachus, and that being how it is with benevolence, was the view of [[Friedrich Nietzsche]].

In the case of Callicles and Nietzsche, this apparently is to be shown by claiming that justice and benevolence, respectively, can be inculcated only by warping the emotional apparatus of the individual.  Foot's book ends by attempting to defuse the evidence Nietzsche brings against what might be called, the common sense position. She proceeds by accepting his basic premise that a way of life that can only be inculcated by damaging the individual's passions, filling one with remorse, resentment, and so forth, is not true. She employs exactly the Nietzschean form of argument against certain forms of femininity, for example, or exaggerated forms of acceptance of etiquette. Justice and benevolence, she claims, however, "suit" human beings, and there is no reason to accept the critique of Callicles or Nietzsche in this case.

== Ethics, aesthetics and political philosophy ==
Nearly all Foot's published work relates to normative or meta-ethics. Only once did she move across the boundary into aesthetics. This was in her 1970 British Academy Hertz Memorial Lecture, ''Art and Morality'', in which certain contrasts are drawn between moral and aesthetic judgements.

Likewise, she appears never to have taken a professional interest in political philosophy. Geoffrey Thomas, of Birkbeck College, London, recalls approaching Foot in 1968, when he was a postgraduate student at Trinity College, Oxford, to ask if she would read a draft paper on the relation of ethics to politics. 'I've never found political philosophy interesting', she said. She added, 'One's bound to interest oneself in the things people around one are talking about', with the implication, perfectly correct, that political philosophy was largely out of favour with Oxford philosophers in the 1950s and 1960s. She still graciously agreed to read the paper. Thomas never sent it to her. {{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}

===By book===

====Book I====
While visiting the [[Piraeus]] with [[Glaucon]], [[Polemarchus]] asks [[Socrates]] to join him for a celebration. Socrates then asks [[Cephalus]], Polemarchus, and [[Thrasymachus]] their definitions of justice. Cephalus defines justice as giving what is owed. Polemarchus says justice is "the art which gives good to friends and evil to enemies." Thrasymachus proclaims "justice is nothing else than the interest of the stronger." Socrates overturns their definitions and says that it is to your advantage to be just and disadvantage to be unjust. The first book ends in [[aporia]] concerning its essence.

====Book II====
Socrates believes he has answered [[Thrasymachus]] and is done with the discussion of justice.

Socrates' young companions, [[Glaucon]] and [[Adeimantus of Collytus|Adeimantus]], continue the argument of Thrasymachus for the sake of furthering the discussion. Glaucon gives a speech in which he argues first that the origin of justice was in social contracts aimed at preventing one from suffering injustice and being unable to take revenge, second that all those who practice justice do so unwillingly and out of fear of punishment, and third that the life of the unjust man is far more blessed than that of the just man. Glaucon would like Socrates to prove that justice is not only desirable, but that it belongs to the highest class of desirable things: those desired both for their own sake and their consequences.

After Glaucon's speech, [[Adeimantus of Collytus|Adeimantus]] adds that, in this thought experiment, the unjust should not fear any sort of divine judgement in the afterlife, since the very poets who wrote about such judgement also wrote that the gods would grant forgiveness to those humans who made ample religious sacrifice. Adeimantus demonstrates his reason by drawing two detailed portraits, that the unjust man could grow wealthy by injustice, devoting a percentage of this gain to religious sacrifices, thus rendering him innocent in the eyes of the gods.

Socrates suggests that they look for justice in a city rather than in an individual man. After attributing the origin of society to the individual not being self-sufficient and having many needs which he cannot supply himself, they go on to describe the development of the city. Socrates first describes the "healthy state", but Glaucon asks him to describe "a city of pigs", as he finds little difference between the two. He then goes on to describe the luxurious city, which he calls "a fevered state".&lt;ref name="PlatoFowler1977"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Plato|author2=Harold North Fowler|author3=Paul Shorey|title=Plato in Twelve Volumes|url=http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0059.tlg030.perseus-eng1:2.372d|volume=5-6|year=1977|publisher=W. Heinemann|isbn=978-0-674-99040-1|location=372d}}&lt;/ref&gt; This requires a guardian class to defend and attack on its account. This begins a discussion concerning the type of education that ought to be given to these guardians in their early years, including the topic of what kind of stories are appropriate.  They conclude that stories that ascribe evil to the gods are untrue and should not be taught.

====Book III====
Socrates and his companions Adeimantus and Glaucon conclude their discussion concerning education. Socrates breaks the educational system into two. They suggest that guardians should  be educated in these four virtues: wisdom, courage, justice and temperance. They also suggest that the second part of the guardians' education should be in gymnastics. With physical training they will be able to live without needing frequent medical attention: physical training will help prevent illness and weakness. Socrates asserts that both male and female guardians be given the same education, that all wives and children be shared, and that they be prohibited from owning private property.

====Book IV====
Socrates and his companions conclude their discussion concerning the lifestyle of the guardians, thus concluding their initial assessment of the city as a whole. Socrates assumes each person will be happy engaging in the occupation that suits them best. If the city as a whole is happy, then individuals are happy. In the physical education and diet of the guardians, the emphasis is on moderation, since both poverty and excessive wealth will corrupt them (422a1). Without controlling their education, the city cannot control the future rulers. Socrates says that it is pointless to worry over specific laws, like those pertaining to contracts, since proper education ensures lawful behavior, and poor education causes lawlessness (425a-425c).&lt;ref&gt;Julia Annas, “Law in the Republic” from ''Virtue and Law in Plato and Beyond'', (Oxford Scholarship Online, 2017)

DOI:10.1093/oso/9780198755746.003.0002&lt;/ref&gt;

Socrates proceeds to search for wisdom, courage, and temperance in the city, on the grounds that justice will be easier to discern in what remains (427e). They find wisdom among the guardian rulers, courage among the guardian warriors (or auxiliaries), temperance among all classes of the city in agreeing about who should rule and who should be ruled. Finally, Socrates defines justice in the city as the state in which each class performs only its own work, not meddling in the work of the other classes (433b). 

The virtues discovered in the city are then sought in the individual soul. For this purpose, Socrates creates an analogy between the parts of the city and the soul (the city-soul analogy). He argues that psychological conflict points to a divided soul, since a completely unified soul could not behave in opposite ways towards the same object, at the same time, and in the same respect (436b).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Brown|first=Eric|title=Plato's Ethics and Politics in The Republic|date=2017|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2017/entries/plato-ethics-politics/|work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Fall 2017|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|access-date=2018-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; He gives examples of possible conflicts between the rational, “spirited,” and appetitive parts of the soul, corresponding to the rulers, auxiliaries, and producing classes in the city. 

Having established the tripartite soul, Socrates defines the virtues of the individual. A person is wise if he is ruled by the part of the soul that knows “what is beneficial for each part and for the whole,” courageous if his spirited part “preserves in the midst of pleasures and pains” the decisions reached by the rational part, and temperate if the three parts agree that the rational part lead (442c-d).&lt;ref&gt;Plato. Plato in Twelve Volumes, Vols. 5 &amp; 6 translated by Paul Shorey. Cambridge, MA, Harvard University Press; London, William Heinemann Ltd. 1969.&lt;/ref&gt; They are just if each part of the soul attends to its function and not the function of another. It follows from this definition that one cannot be just if one doesn’t have the other cardinal virtues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Brown|first=Eric|title=Plato's Ethics and Politics in The Republic|date=2017|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2017/entries/plato-ethics-politics/|work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Fall 2017|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|access-date=2018-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Book V====
Socrates, having to his satisfaction defined the just constitution of both city and psyche, moves to elaborate upon the four unjust constitutions of these. Adeimantus and Polemarchus interrupt, asking Socrates instead first to explain how the sharing of wives and children in the guardian class is to be defined and legislated, a theme first touched on in Book III. Socrates is overwhelmed at their request, categorizing it as three "waves" of attack against which his reasoning must stand firm. These three waves challenge Socrates' claims that 

* both male and female guardians ought to receive the same education
* human reproduction ought to be regulated by the state and all offspring should be ignorant of their actual biological parents
* such a city and its corresponding philosopher-king could actually come to be in the real world.

====Book VI====
Socrates' argument is that in the ideal city, a true philosopher with understanding of forms will facilitate the harmonious co-operation of all the citizens of the city. This philosopher-king must be intelligent, reliable, and willing to lead a simple life. However, these qualities are rarely manifested on their own, and so they must be encouraged through education and the study of The Good. Just as visible objects must be illuminated in order to be seen, so must also be true of objects of knowledge if light is cast on them. Just as light comes from the Sun, so does truth come from goodness. Goodness as the source of truth makes it possible for the mind to know, just as light from the Sun makes the eyes able to see.

====Book VII====
Socrates elaborates upon the immediately preceding Analogies [[Analogy of the Sun|of the Sun]] and of the [[Analogy of the Divided Line|Divided Line]] in the [[Allegory of the Cave]], in which he insists that the psyche must be freed from bondage to the visible/sensible world by making the painful journey into the intelligible world. He continues in the rest of this book by further elaborating upon the curriculum which a would-be philosopher-king must study. This is the origin of the [[quadrivium]]: arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, and music.

Next, they elaborate on the education of the philosopher king. Until age 18, would-be guardians should be engaged in basic intellectual study and physical training, followed by two years of military training. However, a correction is then introduced where the study of gymnastics (martial arts) and warfare - 3 plus 2 years, respectively - are supplanted by philosophy for 5 years instead. Next, they receive ten years of mathematics until age 30, and then five years of [[dialectic]] training. Guardians then spend the next 15 years as leaders, trying to "lead people from the cave". (This refers to "the [[Allegory of the Cave]]") Upon reaching 50, they are fully aware of the form of good, and totally mature and ready to lead.

====Book VIII====
Socrates discusses four unjust constitutions: [[timocracy]], [[oligarchy]], [[democracy]], and [[tyranny]]. He argues that a society will decay and pass through each government in succession, eventually becoming a tyranny, the most unjust regime of all.

The starting point is an imagined, alternate [[aristocracy]] (ruled by a philosopher-king); a just government dominated by the wisdom-loving element. When its social structure breaks down and enters civil war, it is replaced by timocracy. The timocratic government is dominated by the spirited element, with a ruling class of property-owners consisting of warriors or generals ([[Ancient Sparta]] is an example). As the emphasis on honor is compromised by wealth accumulation, it is replaced by oligarchy. The oligarchic government is dominated by the desiring element, in which the rich are the ruling class. The gap between rich and poor widens, culminating in a revolt by the underclass majority, establishing a democracy. Democracy emphasizes maximum freedom, so power is distributed evenly. It is also dominated by the desiring element, but in an undisciplined, unrestrained way. The populism of the democratic government leads to mob rule, fueled by fear of oligarchy, which a clever demagogue can exploit to take power and establish tyranny. In a tyrannical government, the city is enslaved to the tyrant, who uses his guards to remove the best social elements and individuals from the city to retain power (since they pose a threat), while leaving the worst. He will also provoke warfare to consolidate his position as leader. In this way, tyranny is the most unjust regime of all.

In parallel to this, Socrates considers the individual or soul that corresponds to each of these regimes. He describes how an aristocrat may become weak or detached from political and material affluence, and how his son will respond to this by becoming overly ambitious. The timocrat in turn may be defeated by the courts or vested interests; his son responds by accumulating wealth in order to gain power in society and defend himself against the same predicament, thereby becoming an oligarch. The oligarch's son will grow up with wealth without having to practice thrift or stinginess, and will be tempted and overwhelmed by his desires, so that he becomes democratic, valuing freedom above all.

====Book IX====
Having discussed the tyrannical constitution of a city, Socrates wishes to discuss the tyrannical constitution of a psyche. This is all intended to answer Thrasymachus' first argument in Book I, that the life of the unjust man (here understood as a true tyrant) is more blessed than that of the just man (the philosopher-king).

First, he describes how a tyrannical man develops from a democratic household. The democratic man is torn between tyrannical passions and oligarchic discipline, and ends up in the middle ground: valuing all desires, both good and bad. The tyrant will be tempted in the same way as the democrat, but without an upbringing in discipline or moderation to restrain him. Therefore, his most base desires and wildest passions overwhelm him, and he becomes driven by lust, using force and fraud to take whatever he wants. The tyrant is both a slave to his lusts, and a master to whomever he can enslave.

Because of this, tyranny is the regime with the least freedom and happiness, and the tyrant is most unhappy of all, since the regime and soul correspond. His desires are never fulfilled, and he always must live in fear of his victims. Because the tyrant can only think in terms of servant and master, he has no equals whom he can befriend, and with no friends the tyrant is robbed of freedom. This is the first proof that it is better to be just than unjust. The second proof is derived from the tripartite theory of soul. The wisdom-loving soul is best equipped to judge what is best through reason, and the wise individual judges wisdom to be best, then honor, then desire. This is the just proportion for the city or soul and stands opposite to tyranny, which is entirely satiated on base desires. The third proof follows from this. He describes how the soul can be misled into experiencing false pleasure: for example, a lack of pain can seem pleasurable by comparison to a worse state. True pleasure is had by being fulfilled by things that fit one's nature. Wisdom is the most fulfilling and is the best guide, so the only way for the three drives of the soul to function properly and experience the truest pleasure is by allowing wisdom to lead. To conclude the third proof, the wisdom element is best at providing pleasure, while tyranny is worst because it is furthest  removed from wisdom.

Finally, Socrates considers the multiple of how much worse tyranny is than the kingly/disciplined/wise temperament, and even quantifies the tyrant as living 729 times more painfully/less joyfully than the king. He then gives the example of a chimera to further illustrate justice and the tripartite soul.

The discussion concludes by refuting Thrasymachus' argument and designating the most blessed life as that of the just man and the most miserable life as that of the unjust man.

====Book X====
Concluding a theme brought up most explicitly in the Analogies of the Sun and Divided Line in Book VI, Socrates finally rejects any form of imitative art and concludes that such artists have no place in the just city. He continues on to argue for the immortality of the psyche and even espouses a theory of reincarnation. He finishes by detailing the rewards of being just, both in this life and the next. Artists create things but they are only different copies of the idea of the original. 
"And whenever any one informs us that he has found a man who knows all the arts, and all things else that anybody knows, and every single thing with a higher degree of accuracy than any other man—whoever tells us this, I think that we can only imagine to be a simple creature who is likely to have been deceived by some wizard or actor whom he met, and whom he thought all-knowing, because he himself was unable to analyze the nature of knowledge and ignorance and imitation."&lt;ref name="The Republic Book X"&gt;''The Republic'', Book X&lt;/ref&gt;

"And the same object appears straight when looked at out of the water, and crooked when in the water; and the concave becomes convex, owing to the illusion about colours to which the sight is liable. Thus every sort of confusion is revealed within us; and this is that weakness of the human mind on which the art of conjuring and deceiving by light and shadow and other ingenous devices imposes, having an effect upon us like magic."&lt;ref name="The Republic Book X"/&gt;

He speaks about illusions and confusion. Things can look very similar, but be different in reality. Because we are human, at times we cannot tell the difference between the two.

"And does not the same hold also of the ridiculous? There are jests which you would be ashamed to make yourself, and yet on the comic stage, or indeed in private, when you hear them, you are greatly amused by them, and are not at all disgusted at their unseemliness—the case of pity is repeated—there is a principle in human nature which is disposed to raise a laugh, and this which you once restrained by reason, because you were afraid of being thought a buffoon, is now let out again; and having stimulated the risible faculty at the theatre, you are betrayed unconsciously to yourself into playing the comic poet at home."

With all of us, we may approve of something, as long we are not directly involved with it. If we joke about it, we are supporting it.

"Quite true, he said. 
And the same may be said of lust and anger and all the other affections, of desire and pain and pleasure, which are held to be inseparable from every action—in all of them poetry feeds and waters the passions instead of drying them up; she lets them rule, although they ought to be controlled, if mankind are ever to increase in happiness and virtue."&lt;ref name="The Republic Book X"/&gt;

Sometimes we let our passions rule our actions or way of thinking, although they should be controlled, so that we can increase our happiness.

===Scholarly views===
[[File:P. Oxy. LII 3679.jpg|thumb|P. Oxy. 3679, manuscript from the 3rd century AD, containing fragments of Plato's Republic.]]
Three interpretations of the ''Republic'' are presented in the following section; they are not exhaustive in their treatments of the work, but are examples of contemporary interpretation.

====Bertrand Russell====
In his ''[[A History of Western Philosophy]]'' (1945), [[Bertrand Russell]] identifies three parts to the ''Republic'':&lt;ref&gt;[[Bertrand Russell|Russell, Bertrand]], ''[[History of Western Philosophy (Russell)|History of Western Philosophy]]'', begin of Book I, part 2, ch. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;
# Books I–V: from the attempt to define ''justice'', the description of an ideal community (''eutopia'') and the education of its Guardians;
# Books VI–VII: the nature of [[philosopher]]s, the ideal rulers of such a community;
# Books VIII–X: the pros and cons of various practical [[form of government|forms of government]].

The core of the second part is the [[Allegory of the Cave]] and the discussion of the [[Platonic realism|theory of ideal forms]]. The third part concerns the [[Five Regimes]] and is strongly related to the later dialogue ''[[Laws (Plato)|The Laws]]''; and the [[Myth of Er]].

The paradigm of the city—the idea of [[the Good]], the ''Agathon''—has manifold historical embodiments, undertaken by those who have seen the Agathon, and are ordered via the vision. The centerpiece of the ''Republic'', Part II, nos. 2–3, discusses the rule of the philosopher, and the vision of the Agathon with the [[Allegory of the Cave|allegory of the cave]], which is clarified in the [[theory of forms]]. The centerpiece is preceded and followed by the discussion of the means that will secure a well-ordered ''[[polis]]'' (City). Part II, no. 1, concerns marriage, the community of people and goods for the guardians, and the restraints on warfare among the Hellenes. It describes a partially [[Communism|communistic]] ''polis''. Part II, no. 4, deals with the philosophical education of the rulers who will preserve the order and character of the city-state.

In part II, the ''Embodiment of the Idea'', is preceded by the establishment of the economic and social orders of a ''polis'' (part I), followed by an analysis (part III) of the decline the order must traverse. The three parts compose the main body of the dialogues, with their discussions of the "paradigm", its embodiment, its genesis, and its decline.

The introduction and the conclusion are the frame for the body of the ''Republic''. The discussion of right order is occasioned by the questions: "Is justice better than injustice?" and "Will an unjust man fare better than a just man?" The introductory question is balanced by the concluding answer: "Justice is preferable to injustice". In turn, the foregoing are framed with the ''Prologue'' (Book I) and the ''Epilogue'' (Book X). The prologue is a short dialogue about the common public ''[[doxai]]'' (opinions) about justice. Based upon faith, and not reason, the ''Epilogue'' describes the new arts and the [[immortality]] of the [[soul]].

==== Leo Strauss ====
[[Leo Strauss]] identified a four-part structure to the ''Republic'',{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}} perceiving the dialogues as a drama enacted by particular characters, each with a particular perspective and level of intellect:
 
#Book I: Socrates is forcefully compelled to the house of [[Cephalus (person)|Cephalus]]. Three definitions of justice are presented, all are found lacking.
#Books II–V: [[Glaucon]] and [[Adeimantus of Collytus|Adeimantus]] challenge Socrates to prove why a perfectly just man, perceived by the world as an unjust man, would be happier than the perfectly unjust man who hides his injustice and is perceived by the world as a just man. Their challenge begins and propels the dialogues; in answering the challenge, of the "charge", Socrates reveals his behavior with the young men of Athens, whom he later was convicted of corrupting. Because Glaucon and Adeimantus presume a definition of justice, Socrates digresses; he compels the group's attempt to discover justice, and then answers the question posed to him about the intrinsic value of the just life.
#Books V–VI: The "Just City in Speech" is built from the earlier books, and concerns three critiques of the city. Leo Strauss reported that his student [[Allan Bloom]] identified them as: communism, communism of wives and children, and the rule of philosophers. The "Just City in Speech" stands or falls by these complications.
#Books VII–X: Socrates has "escaped" his captors, having momentarily convinced them that the just man is the happy man, by reinforcing their prejudices. He presents a rationale for political decay, and concludes by recounting [[The Myth of Er]] ("[[everyman]]"), consolation for non-philosophers who fear death.{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}

==Topics==

===Definition of justice===
{{Refimprove section|date=March 2010}}
In the first book, two definitions of justice are proposed but deemed inadequate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://classics.mit.edu/Plato/republic.1.introduction.html|title=The Internet Classics Archive - The Republic by Plato|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Returning debts owed, and helping friends while harming enemies, are commonsense definitions of justice that, Socrates shows, are inadequate in exceptional situations, and thus lack the rigidity demanded of a [[definition]]. Yet he does not completely reject them, for each expresses a commonsense notion of justice that Socrates will incorporate into his discussion of the just regime in books II through V.

At the end of Book I, Socrates agrees with Polemarchus that justice includes helping friends, but says the just man would never do harm to anybody. Thrasymachus believes that Socrates has done the men present an injustice by saying this and attacks his character and reputation in front of the group, partly because he suspects that Socrates himself does not even believe harming enemies is unjust. Thrasymachus gives his understanding of justice and injustice as "justice is what is advantageous to the stronger, while injustice is to one's own profit and advantage".&lt;ref&gt;Plato. Book I, 344c. Plato Republic. Indianapolis: Hackett, 2004. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Socrates finds this definition unclear and begins to question Thrasymachus. Socrates then asks whether the ruler who makes a mistake by making a law that lessens their well-being, is still a ruler according to that definition. Thrasymachus agrees that no true ruler would make such an error. This agreement allows Socrates to undermine Thrasymachus' strict definition of justice by comparing rulers to people of various professions. Thrasymachus consents to Socrates' assertion that an artist is someone who does his job well, and is a knower of some art, which allows him to complete the job well. In so doing Socrates gets Thrasymachus to admit that rulers who enact a law that does not benefit them firstly, are in the precise sense ''not'' rulers. Thrasymachus gives up, and is silent from then on. Socrates has trapped Thrasymachus into admitting the strong man who makes a mistake is not the strong man in the precise sense, and that some type of knowledge is required to rule perfectly. However, it is far from a satisfactory definition of justice.

At the beginning of Book II, Plato's two brothers challenge Socrates to define justice in the man, and unlike the rather short and simple definitions offered in Book I, their views of justice are presented in two independent speeches. Glaucon's speech reprises Thrasymachus' idea of justice; it starts with the legend of [[Gyges of Lydia|Gyges]],  who discovered a [[Ring of Gyges|ring]] that gave him the power to become invisible. Glaucon uses this story to argue that no man would be just if he had the opportunity of doing injustice with [[impunity]]. With the power to become invisible, Gyges is able to seduce the queen, murder the king, and take over the kingdom. Glaucon argues that the just as well as the unjust man would do the same if they had the power to get away with injustice exempt from punishment. The only reason that men are just and praise justice is out of fear of being punished for injustice. The law is a product of compromise between individuals who agree not to do injustice to others if others will not do injustice to them. Glaucon says that if people had the power to do injustice without fear of punishment, they would not enter into such an agreement. Glaucon uses this argument to challenge Socrates to defend the position that the unjust life is better than the just life. Adeimantus adds to Glaucon's speech the charge that men are only just for the results that justice brings one fortune, honor, reputation. Adeimantus challenges Socrates to prove that being just is worth something in and of itself, not only as a means to an end.

Socrates says that there is no better topic to debate. In response to the two views of injustice and justice presented by Glaucon and Adeimantus, he claims incompetence, but feels it would be impious to leave justice in such doubt. Thus the ''Republic'' sets out to define [[justice]]. Given the difficulty of this task as proven in Book I, [[Socrates]] in Book II leads his interlocutors into a discussion of justice in the city, which Socrates suggests may help them see justice not only in the person, but on a larger scale, "first in cities searching for what it is; then thusly we could examine also in some individual, examining the likeness of the bigger in the idea of the littler" (368e–369a).&lt;ref&gt;"Suppose that a short-sighted person had been asked by some one to read small letters from a distance; and it occurred to some one else that they might be found in another place which was larger and in which the letters were larger..." (368, trans. Jowett).&lt;/ref&gt;

For over two and a half millennia, scholars have differed on the aptness of the city-soul analogy Socrates uses to find justice in Books II through V.&lt;ref&gt;For an oft-cited argument that the analogy does not work, see T. Penner, “Thought and Desire in Plato.” in G Vlastos ed., Plato, Vol. 2. Anchor Books, 1971&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Republic'' is a dramatic dialogue, not a treatise. Socrates' definition of justice is never unconditionally stated, only versions of justice within each city are "found" and evaluated in Books II through Book V. Socrates  constantly refers the definition of justice back to the conditions of the city for which it is created. He builds a series of myths, or [[noble lie]]s, to make the cities appear just, and these conditions moderate life within the communities. The "earth born" myth makes all men believe that they are born from the earth and have predestined natures within their veins. Accordingly, Socrates defines justice as "working at that which he is naturally best suited", and "to do one's own business and not to be a busybody" (433a–433b) and goes on to say that justice sustains and perfects the other three [[cardinal virtues]]: Temperance, Wisdom, and Courage, and that justice is the cause and condition of their existence. Socrates does not include justice as a virtue within the city, suggesting that justice does not exist within the human soul either, rather it is the result of a "well ordered" soul. A result of this conception of justice separates people into three types; that of the soldier, that of the producer, and that of a ruler. If a ruler can create just laws, and if the warriors can carry out the orders of the rulers, and if the producers can obey this authority, then a society will be just.

The city is challenged by Adeimantus and Glaucon throughout its development: Adeimantus cannot find happiness in the city, and Glaucon cannot find honor and glory. This hypothetical city contains no private property, no marriage, or nuclear families. These are sacrificed for the common good and doing what is best fitting to one's nature. In Book V Socrates addresses the question of "natural-ness" of and possibility for this city, concluding in Book VI, that the city's ontological status regards a construction of the soul, not of an actual metropolis.

The rule of [[philosopher-king]]s appear as the issue of possibility is raised. Socrates never positively states what justice is in the human soul/city; it appears he has created a city where justice is not found, but can be lost. It is as though in a well-ordered state, justice is not even needed, since the community satisfies the needs of humans.

In terms of why it is best to be just rather than unjust for the individual, Plato prepares an answer in Book IX consisting of three main arguments.  Plato says that a tyrant's nature will leave him with "horrid pains and pangs" and that the typical tyrant engages in a lifestyle that will be physically and mentally exacting on such a ruler.  Such a disposition is in contrast to the truth-loving [[philosopher king]], and a tyrant "never tastes of true freedom or friendship".  The second argument proposes that of all the different types of people, only the philosopher is able to judge which type of ruler is best since only he can see the [[Form of the Good]].  Thirdly, Plato argues, "Pleasures which are approved of by the lover of wisdom and reason are the truest." In sum, Plato argues that philosophical pleasure is the only true pleasure since other pleasures experienced by others are simply a neutral state free of pain.

Socrates points out the human tendency to be corrupted by power leads down the road to [[timocracy]], [[oligarchy]], [[democracy]] and [[tyranny]]. From this, he concludes that ruling should be left to philosophers, who are the most just and therefore least susceptible to corruption. This "good city" is depicted as being governed by philosopher-kings; disinterested persons who rule not for their personal enjoyment but for the good of the city-state (polis). The paradigmatic society which stands behind every historical society is hierarchical, but social classes have a marginal permeability; there are no slaves, no discrimination between men and women. The men and women are both to be taught the same things, so they are both able to be used for the same things (451e). In addition to the ruling class of guardians ([[:wiktionary:φύλακες|φύλακες]]), which abolished riches, there is a class of private producers (demiourgoi), who may be rich or poor. A number of provisions aim to avoid making the people weak: the substitution of a universal educational system for men and women instead of debilitating music, poetry and theatre—a startling departure from Greek society. These provisions apply to all classes, and the restrictions placed on the philosopher-kings chosen from the warrior class and the warriors are much more severe than those placed on the producers, because the rulers must be kept away from any source of corruption.

In Books V-VI the abolition of riches among the guardian class (not unlike Max Weber's bureaucracy) leads controversially to the abandonment of the typical family, and as such no child may know his or her parents and the parents may not know their own children. Socrates tells a tale which is the "allegory of the good government". The rulers assemble couples for reproduction, based on breeding criteria. Thus, stable population is achieved through eugenics and social cohesion is projected to be high because familial links are extended towards everyone in the city. Also the education of the youth is such that they are taught of only works of writing that encourage them to improve themselves for the state's good, and envision (the) god(s) as entirely good, just, and the author(s) of only that which is good.

In Books VII-X stand Plato's criticism of the forms of government. It begins with the dismissal of timocracy, a sort of authoritarian regime, not unlike a military dictatorship. Plato offers an almost psychoanalytical explanation of the "timocrat" as one who saw his father humiliated by his mother and wants to vindicate "manliness". The third worst regime is oligarchy, the rule of a small band of rich people, millionaires that only respect money. Then comes the democratic form of government, and its susceptibility to being ruled by unfit "sectarian" demagogues. Finally the worst regime is tyranny, where the whimsical desires of the ruler became law and there is no check upon arbitrariness.

===Theory of universals===
{{see also|Problem of universals|Allegory of the Cave|Theory of Forms}}

The ''Republic'' contains Plato's [[Allegory of the Cave|''Allegory of the cave'']] with which he explains his concept of [[The Forms]] as an answer to the [[problem of universals]].

The allegory of the cave primarily depicts Plato's distinction between the world of appearances and the 'real' world of the Forms,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Silverman|first=Allan|title=Plato's Middle Period Metaphysics and Epistemology|date=2014|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2014/entries/plato-metaphysics/|work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Fall 2014|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|access-date=2018-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as helping to justify the philosopher's place in society as king. Plato imagines a group of people who have lived their entire lives as prisoners, chained to the wall of a cave in the subterranean so they are unable to see the outside world behind them. However a constant flame illuminates various moving objects outside, which are silhouetted on the wall of the cave visible to the prisoners. These prisoners, through having no other experience of reality, ascribe forms to these shadows such as either "dog" or "cat".

Plato then goes on to explain how the philosopher is akin to a prisoner who is freed from the cave. The prisoner is initially blinded by the light, but when he adjusts to the brightness he sees the fire and the statues and how they caused the images witnessed inside the cave. He sees that the fire and statues in the cave were just copies of the real objects; merely imitations. This is analogous to the Forms. What we see from day to day are merely appearances, reflections of the Forms. The philosopher, however, will not be deceived by the shadows and will hence be able to see the 'real' world, the world above that of appearances; the philosopher will gain knowledge of things in themselves. In this analogy the sun is representative of the Good. This is the main object of the philosopher's knowledge. The Good can be thought of as the form of Forms, or the structuring of the world as a whole.

The prisoner's stages of understanding correlate with the levels on the [[The divided line of Plato|divided line]] which he imagines. The line is divided into what the visible world is and what the intelligible world is, with the divider being the Sun. When the prisoner is in the cave, he is obviously in the visible realm that receives no sunlight, and outside he comes to be in the intelligible realm.

The shadows witnessed in the cave correspond to the lowest level on Plato's line, that of imagination and conjecture. Once the prisoner is freed and sees the shadows for what they are he reaches the second stage on the divided line, the stage of belief, for he comes to believe that the statues in the cave are real. On leaving the cave, however, the prisoner comes to see objects more real than the statues inside of the cave, and this correlates with the third stage on Plato's line, thought. Lastly, the prisoner turns to the sun which he grasps as the source of truth, or the Form of the Good, and this last stage, named as dialectic, is the highest possible stage on the line. The prisoner, as a result of the Form of the Good, can begin to understand all other forms in reality.

At the end of this allegory, Plato asserts that it is the philosopher's burden to reenter the cave. Those who have seen the ideal world, he says, have the duty to educate those in the material world. Since the philosopher recognizes what is truly good only he is fit to rule society according to Plato.

===The dialectical forms of government===
{{Main article|Plato's five regimes}}

While Plato spends much of the ''Republic'' having Socrates narrate a conversation about the city he founds with Glaucon and Adeimantus "in speech", the discussion eventually turns to considering four regimes that exist in reality and tend to degrade successively into each other: timocracy, oligarchy (also called plutocracy), democracy and tyranny (also called despotism).

'''Timocracy'''

Socrates defines a [[timocracy]] as a government of people who love rule and honor. Socrates argues that the timocracy emerges from aristocracy due to a civil war breaking out among the ruling class and the majority. Over time, many more births will occur to people who lack aristocratic, guardian qualities, slowly drawing the populace away from knowledge, music, poetry and "guardian education", toward money-making and the acquisition of possessions. This civil war between those who value wisdom and those who value material acquisition will continue until a compromise is reached. The timocracy values war insofar as it satisfies a love of victory and honor. The timocratic man loves physical training, and hunting, and values his abilities in warfare.

'''Oligarchy'''

Temptations create a confusion between economic status and honor which is responsible for the emergence of [[oligarchy]]. In Book VIII, Socrates suggests that wealth will not help a pilot to navigate his ship, as his concerns will be directed centrally toward increasing his wealth by whatever means, rather than seeking out wisdom or honor. The injustice of economic disparity divides the rich and the poor, thus creating an environment for criminals and beggars to emerge. The rich are constantly plotting against the poor and vice versa. The oligarchic constitution is based on property assessment and wealth qualification. Unlike the timocracy, oligarchs are also unable to fight war, since they do not wish to arm the majority for fear of their rising up against them (fearing the majority even more than their enemies), nor do they seem to pay mercenaries, since they are reluctant to spend money.

'''Democracy'''

As this socioeconomic divide grows, so do tensions between social classes. From the conflicts arising out of such tensions, the poor majority overthrow the wealthy minority, and [[democracy]] replaces the oligarchy preceding it. The poor overthrow the oligarchs and grant liberties and freedoms to citizens, creating a most variegated collection of peoples under a "supermarket" of constitutions. A visually appealing [[demagogue]] is soon lifted up to protect the interests of the lower class. However, with too much freedom, no requirements for anyone to rule, and having no interest in assessing the background of their rulers (other than honoring such people because they wish the majority well) the people become easily persuaded by such a demagogue's appeal to try and satisfy people's common, base, and unnecessary pleasures.

'''Tyranny'''

The excessive freedoms granted to the citizens of a democracy ultimately leads to a [[tyranny]], the furthest regressed type of government.  These freedoms divide the people into three socioeconomic classes: the dominating class, the elites and the commoners.  Tensions between the dominating class and the elites cause the commoners to seek out protection of their democratic liberties.  They invest all their power in their democratic demagogue, who, in turn, becomes corrupted by the power and becomes a tyrant with a small entourage of his supporters for protection and absolute control of his people.

==Reception and interpretation==

===Ancient Greece===
The idea of writing treatises on systems of government was followed some decades later by Plato's most prominent pupil [[Aristotle]], whose [[Politics (Aristotle)|''Politika'']] systematises many of Plato's concepts, in some cases differing from his conclusions.

It has been suggested that [[Isocrates]] parodies the ''Republic'' in his work ''[[Busiris (Greek mythology)|Busiris]]'' by showing Callipolis' similarity to the Egyptian state founded by a king of that name.&lt;ref&gt;Most recently, Niall Livingstone, ''A Commentary on Isocrates' Busiris''. ''Mnemosyne Supplement'' 223. Leiden:  Brill, 2001 (see review by David C. Mirhady in [http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/bmcr/2004/2004-09-37.html Bryn Mawr Classical Review]). For earlier consideration of the similarities, see H. Thesleff, ''Studies in Platonic Chronology'', Helsinki 1982, pp. 105f., and C. Eucken, ''Isokrates'', Berlin 1983, pp. 172 ff. Both Thesleff and Eucken entertain the possibility that Isocrates was responding to an earlier version of ''Republic'' than the final version we possess.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Zeno of Citium]], the founder of [[Stoicism]], wrote his own imitation of Plato's ''Republic'', c. 300 BC. ''[[The Republic (Zeno)|Zeno's Republic]]'' advocates a form of [[anarchism]] in which all of the citizens are philosophers, and advocates a more radical form of sexual communism than that proposed by Plato.

===Ancient Rome===

====Cicero====
The English title of Plato's dialogue is derived from [[Cicero]]'s ''[[De re publica]]'', written some three centuries later. Cicero's dialogue imitates Plato's style and treats many of the same topics, and Cicero's main character [[Scipio Africanus Minor|Scipio Africanus]] expresses his esteem for Plato and Socrates.

''Res publica'' is not an exact translation of Plato's Greek title ''politeia''. Rather, ''politeia'' is a general term for the actual and potential forms of government for a ''Polis'' or city-state, and Plato attempts to survey all possible forms of the state. Cicero's discussion is more parochial, focusing on the improvement of the participants' own state, the [[Roman Republic]] in its final stages.

====Tacitus====
In antiquity, Plato's works were largely acclaimed, but a few commentators regarded them as too theoretical. [[Tacitus]], commented on such works as ''The Republic'' and [[Politics (Aristotle)|Aristotle's ''Politics'']] in his ''[[Annals (Tacitus)|Ann.]]'' (IV, 33):

In this work, Tacitus undertakes the prosaic description and minute analysis of how real states are governed, attempting to derive more practical lessons about good versus bad governance than can be deduced from speculations on ideal governments.

====Augustine====
In the pivotal era of Rome's move from its ancient [[polytheism|polytheist]] religion to Christianity, [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] wrote his magnum opus ''[[City of God (book)|The City of God]]'': Again, the references to Plato, Aristotle and Cicero and their visions of the ideal state were legion: Augustine equally described a model of the "ideal city", in his case the eternal [[Jerusalem]], using a visionary language not unlike that of the preceding philosophers.

===Islam===
Islamic philosophers were much more interested in Aristotle than Plato, but not having access to Aristotle's [[Politics (Aristotle)|''Politics'']], Ibn Rushd ([[Averroes]]) produced instead a commentary on
Plato's ''Republic''. He advances an authoritarian ideal, following Plato's paternalistic model. Absolute monarchy, led by a philosopher-king, creates a justly ordered society. This requires extensive use of coercion,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Black|first=Antony|title=The History of Islamic Political Thought|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|edition=2nd|year=2011|isbn=978-0-7486-3987-8|page=122}}&lt;/ref&gt; although persuasion is preferred and is possible if the young are properly raised.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Fakhry |first=Majid |title=Averroes (Ibn Rushd) His Life, Works and Influence |publisher=[[Oneworld Publications]] |year=2001| p=106 |isbn=978-1-85168-269-0 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rhetoric, not logic, is the appropriate road to truth for the common man. Demonstrative knowledge via philosophy and logic requires special study.

Following Plato, Ibn Rushd accepts the principle of women's equality. They should be educated and allowed to serve in the military; the best among them might be tomorrow's philosophers or rulers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Averroës|first=Erwin I.J.|last=Rosenthal|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, inc.|date=2017-12-26|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Averroes|ref=harv}|p=xix}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvard citation|Fakhry|2001|p=110}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also accepts Plato's illiberal measures such as the censorship of literature. He uses examples from Arab history to illustrate just and degenerate political orders.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvard citation|Fakhry|2001|p=114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hegel===
[[Hegel]] respected Plato's theories of state and ethics much more than those of the early modern philosophers such as [[John Locke|Locke]], [[Hobbes]] and [[Rousseau]], whose theories proceeded from a fictional "[[state of nature]]" defined by humanity's "natural" needs, desires and freedom.  For Hegel this was a contradiction: since nature and the individual are contradictory, the  freedoms which define individuality as such are latecomers on the stage of history.  Therefore, these philosophers unwittingly projected man as an individual in modern society onto a primordial state of nature.  Plato however had managed to grasp the ideas specific to his time:

{{Quotation|Plato is not the man to dabble in abstract theories and principles; his truth-loving mind has recognized and represented the truth of the world in which he lived, the truth of the one spirit that lived in him as in Greece itself.  No man can overleap his time, the spirit of his time is his spirit also; but the point at issue is, to recognize that spirit by its content.&lt;ref&gt;Hegel, "Lectures on the Philosophy of History", vol II, p. 96&lt;/ref&gt;}}

For Hegel, Plato's Republic is not an abstract theory or ideal which is too good for the real nature of man, but rather is not ideal enough, not good enough for the ideals already inherent or nascent in the reality of his time; a time when Greece was entering decline. One such nascent idea was about to crush the Greek way of life: modern freedoms—or Christian freedoms in Hegel's view—such as the individual's choice of his social class, or of what property to pursue, or which career to follow. Such individual freedoms were excluded from Plato's Republic:

{{Quotation|Plato recognized and caught up the true spirit of his times, and brought it forward in a more definite way, in that he desired to make this new principle an impossibility in his Republic.&lt;ref&gt;Hegel, "Lectures on the Philosophy of History", vol II, p. 99&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Greece being at a crossroads, Plato's new "constitution" in the ''Republic'' was an attempt to preserve Greece: it was a reactionary reply to the new freedoms of private property etc., that were eventually given legal form through Rome. Accordingly, in ethical life, it was an attempt to introduce a religion that elevated each individual not as an owner of property, but as the possessor of an immortal soul.

===20th century===

====Gadamer====
In his 1934 ''Plato und die Dichter'' (''Plato and the Poets''), as well as several other works, [[Hans-Georg Gadamer]] describes the utopic city of the ''Republic'' as a [[heuristic]] [[utopia]] that should not be pursued or even be used as an orientation-point for political development. Rather, its purpose is said to be to show how things would have to be connected, and how one thing would lead to another—often with highly problematic results—if one would opt for certain principles and carry them through rigorously. This interpretation argues that large passages in Plato's writing are [[irony|ironic]], a line of thought initially pursued by [[Kierkegaard]].

====Popper====
The city portrayed in the ''Republic'' struck some critics as harsh, rigid, and unfree; indeed, as [[totalitarian]]. [[Karl Popper]] gave a voice to that view in his 1945 book ''[[The Open Society and Its Enemies]]'', where he singled out Plato's state as a dystopia. Popper divorced Plato's ideas from those of Socrates, claiming that the former in his later years expressed none of the [[humanitarian]] and [[democracy|democratic]] tendencies of his teacher. In particular, Popper accuses Plato of betraying Socrates. [[Gilbert Ryle]], reviewing Popper's text just two years after its publication&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=G. |last=Ryle |authorlink=Gilbert Ryle |title=Popper, K.R. - ''The Open Society and its Enemies'' |journal=[[Mind (journal)|Mind]] |date=1 April 1947 |volume=56 |issue=222 |page=167–172 |doi=10.1093/mind/LVI.222.167 |jstor=2250518}}&lt;/ref&gt; and agreeing with him, wrote that Plato "was Socrates' Judas."&lt;ref&gt;Ryle, G. (1947). p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=EgIxAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22was+Socrates'+Judas%22 169]. See also: {{cite book |first=T.E. |last= Burke |title=The Philosophy of Popper |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rIK7AAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover |year=1983 |publisher=[[Manchester University Press]] |location=Manchester |isbn=978-0-71900911-2 |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=rIK7AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=141&amp;dq=%22As+Gilbert+Ryle+put+it,+according+to+Popper,+Plato+was+Socrates'+Judas.+The+very+things+for+which+Socrates+lived+and+died+are+the+things+which+Plato+tries+to+demolish+with+words+put+into+Socrates'+mouth%22 141]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Popper thought Plato's envisioned state totalitarian as it advocated a government composed only of a distinct hereditary ruling class, with the working class—who Popper argues Plato regards as "human cattle"—given no role in decision making. He argues that Plato has no interest in what are commonly regarded as the problems of justice—the resolving of disputes between individuals—because Plato has redefined justice as "keeping one's place".&lt;ref name="popper"&gt;[[Karl Popper|Popper, Karl]] (1950) ''[[The Open Society and Its Enemies]], Vol. 1: The Spell of Plato'', New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Voegelin====
[[Eric Voegelin]] in ''Plato and Aristotle'' (Baton Rouge, 1957), gave  meaning to the concept of 'Just City in Speech' (Books II-V). For instance, there is evidence in the dialogue that [[Socrates]] himself would not be a member of his 'ideal' state. His life was almost solely dedicated to the private pursuit of [[knowledge]]. More practically, Socrates suggests that members of the lower classes could rise to the higher ruling class, and vice versa, if they had 'gold' in their veins—a version of the concept of [[social mobility]]. The exercise of power is built on the '[[noble lie]]' that all men are brothers, born of the earth, yet there is a clear hierarchy and class divisions. There is a tripartite explanation of human psychology that is extrapolated to the city, the relation among peoples. There is no [[family]] among the guardians, another crude version of [[Max Weber|Max Weber's]] concept of [[bureaucracy]] as the state non-private concern. Together with Leo Strauss, Voegelin considered Popper's interpretation to be a gross misunderstanding not only of the dialogue itself, but of the very nature and character of Plato's entire philosophic enterprise.

====Strauss and Bloom====

Some of [[Plato]]'s proposals have led theorists like [[Leo Strauss]] and [[Allan Bloom]] to ask readers to consider the possibility that [[Socrates]] was creating not a blueprint for a real city, but a learning exercise for the young men in the dialogue. There are many points in the construction of the "Just City in Speech" that seem [[contradictory]], which raise the possibility Socrates is employing [[irony]] to make the men in the dialogue question for themselves the ultimate value of the proposals. In turn, [[Plato]] has immortalized this 'learning exercise' in the ''Republic''.

One of many examples is that Socrates calls the marriages of the ruling class '[[sacred]]'; however, they last only one night and are the result of manipulating and drugging couples into predetermined intercourse with the aim of eugenically breeding guardian-warriors. Strauss and Bloom's interpretations, however, involve more than just pointing out inconsistencies; by calling attention to these issues they ask readers to think more deeply about whether Plato is being ironic or genuine, for neither Strauss nor Bloom present an unequivocal opinion, preferring to raise philosophic doubt over interpretive fact.

Leo Strauss's approach developed out of a belief that [[Plato]] wrote esoterically. The basic acceptance of the [[exoteric]]-[[esoteric]] distinction revolves around whether Plato really wanted to see the "Just City in Speech" of Books V-VI come to pass, or whether it is just an [[allegory]]. Strauss never regarded this as the crucial issue of the dialogue. He argued against Karl Popper's literal view, citing [[Cicero]]'s opinion that the ''Republic's'' true nature was to bring to light the nature of political things.&lt;ref&gt;''History of Political Philosophy'', co-editor with Joseph Cropsey, 3rd. ed., Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1987, p.68&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, Strauss undermines the justice found in the "Just City in Speech" by implying the city is not natural, it is a man-made conceit that abstracts away from the erotic needs of the body. The city founded in the ''Republic'' "is rendered possible by the abstraction from eros".&lt;ref&gt;''History of Political Philosophy'', co-editor with Joseph Cropsey, 3rd. ed., Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1987, p.60&lt;/ref&gt;

An argument that has been used against ascribing ironic intent to Plato is that [[Plato's Academy]] produced a number of [[tyrant]]s who seized political power and abandoned philosophy for ruling a city. Despite being well-versed in Greek and having direct contact with Plato himself, some of Plato's former students like [[Clearchus of Heraclea|Clearchus]], tyrant of [[Heraclea Pontica|Heraclea]]; [[Chaeron of Pellene|Chaeron]], tyrant of [[Pellene]]; [[Erastus of Scepsis|Erastus]] and [[Coriscus of Scepsis|Coriscus]], tyrants of [[Skepsis]]; [[Hermias of Atarneus]] and [[Assos]]; and [[Calippus of Syracuse|Calippus]], tyrant of [[Syracuse, Italy|Syracuse]] ruled people and did not impose anything like a philosopher-kingship. However, it can be argued whether these men became "tyrants" through studying in the Academy. Plato's school had an elite student body, some of whom would by birth, and family expectation, end up in the seats of power. Additionally, it is important to remember that it is by no means obvious that these men were tyrants in the modern, [[totalitarian]] sense of the concept.  Finally, since very little is actually known about what was taught at Plato's Academy, there is no small controversy over whether it was even in the business of teaching politics at all.&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm Schofield, "Plato and Practical Politics", in C. Rowe and M. Schofield (eds.), ''The Cambridge Companion to Greek and Roman Political Thought'', Cambridge University Press 2005, pp. 293-302.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Views on the city–soul analogy====
Many critics, both ancient and modern (like [[Julia Annas]]), have suggested that the dialogue's political discussion actually serves as an analogy for the individual soul, in which there are also many different "members" that can either conflict or else be integrated and orchestrated under a just and productive "government." Among other things, this analogical reading would solve the problem of certain implausible statements Plato makes concerning an ideal political republic. In a definitive treatment of the subject, Blössner (2007)&lt;ref&gt;Blössner, Norbert. The City-Soul Analogy, G. R. F. Ferrari (Translator). In: G. R. F. Ferrari (Ed.), ''The Cambridge Companion to Plato's Republic'', Cambridge University Press, 2007. (Ch. 13; pp. 345–385).&lt;/ref&gt; presents and argues for the case that the ''Republic'' is best understood as an analysis of the workings and moral improvement of the individual soul with remarkable thoroughness and clarity. This view, of course, does not preclude a legitimate reading of the ''Republic'' as a political treatise (the work could operate at both levels). It merely implies that it deserves more attention as a work on psychology and moral philosophy than it has sometimes received.

====Practicality====
The above-mentioned views have in common that they view the ''Republic'' as a theoretical work, not as a set of guidelines for [[good governance]]. However, Popper insists that the Republic, "was meant by its author not so much as a theoretical treatise, but as a topical political manifesto"&lt;ref&gt;Popper, Karl (1950) The Open Society and Its Enemies, Vol. 1: The Spell of Plato, New York: Routledge. p. 162.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Bertrand Russell]] argues that at least in ''intent'', and all in all not so far from what was possible in ancient Greek city-states, the form of government portrayed in the ''Republic'' was meant as a practical one by Plato.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, B. (2004) ''[[History of Western Philosophy (Russell)|History of Western Philosophy]]'', end of Book I, part 2, ch. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

===21st century===

One of Plato's recurring techniques in the ''Republic'' is to refine the concept of justice with reference to various examples of greater or lesser injustice.  However, in ''The Concept of Injustice'',&lt;ref&gt;''The Concept of Injustice'' (Routledge, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eric Heinze]] challenges the assumption that 'justice' and 'injustice' form a mutually exclusive pair.  Heinze argues that such an assumption traces not from strict deductive logic, but from the arbitrary etymology of the word 'injustice'.   Heinze critiques what he calls 'classical' Western justice theory for having perpetuated that logical error, which first appears in Plato's ''Republic'', but manifests throughout traditional political philosophy, in thinkers otherwise as different as [[Aristotle]], [[Aquinas]], Locke, [[Rousseau]], [[Hegel]] and [[Marx]].

In 2001, a survey of over 1,000 academics and students voted the ''Republic'' the greatest philosophical text ever written. [[Julian Baggini]] argued that although the work "was wrong on almost every point, the questions it raises and the methods it uses are essential to the western tradition of philosophy. Without it we might not have philosophy as we know it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2001/sep/07/books.humanities |title=The thinking person's favourite thinkers  |last=Gibbons |first=Fiachra |date=September 7, 2001 |accessdate=March 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In fiction, [[Jo Walton]]'s 2015 novel ''[[The Just City]]'' explored the consequences of establishing a city-state based on the ''Republic'' in practice.

==Place in Plato's corpus==
The ''Republic'' is generally placed in the ''[[Plato#Dialogues|middle period]]'' of Plato's dialogues—that is, it is believed to be written after the ''early period'' dialogues but before the ''late period'' dialogues.  However, the distinction of this group from the early dialogues is not as clear as the distinction of the late dialogues from all the others.  Nonetheless, Ritter, Arnim, and Baron—with their separate methodologies—all agreed that the ''Republic'' was well distinguished, along with ''Parmenides'', ''Phaedrus'' and ''Theaetetus''.&lt;ref&gt;Brandwood, Leonard, ''The Chronology of Plato's Dialogues'' (Cambridge University Press, 1990), p. 251.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the first book of the ''Republic'', which shares many features with earlier dialogues, is thought to have originally been written as a separate work, and then the remaining books were conjoined to it, perhaps with modifications to the original of the first book.&lt;ref&gt;Brandwood (1990), p. 251&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fragments==
Several [[Oxyrhynchus Papyri]] fragments were found to contain parts of the Republic, and from other works such as [[Phaedo]], or the dialogue [[Gorgias (dialogue)|Gorgias]], written around 200-300 CE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/oxyrhynchuspapyr15gren#page/186/mode/2up/search/plato|title=The Oxyrhynchus papyri|authors=Bernard Pyne Grenfell and Arthur Surridge Hunt|year=1898|page=187}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fragments of a different version of Plato's Republic were discovered in 1945, part of the [[Nag Hammadi library]], written ca. 350 CE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mountainman.com.au/essenes/plato_at_nag_hammadi.htm|title=Plato's Republic at Nag Hammadi c.350 CE|author=Mountain Man Graphics}}&lt;/ref&gt; These findings highlight the influence of Plato during those times in Egypt.

In the context of [[ecological stability]], '''resistance''' is the property of [[community (ecology)|communities]] or populations to remain "essentially unchanged"&lt;ref name="Grimm1997"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Grimm|first=Volker|author2=Christian Wissel |date=1997|title=Babel, or the ecological stability discussions: an inventory and analysis of terminology and a guide for avoiding confusion|journal=Oecologia|volume=109|pages=323–334|doi=10.1007/s004420050090}}&lt;/ref&gt; when subject to [[disturbance (ecology)|disturbance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Levin|first=Simon A.|title=The Princeton Guide to Ecology|publisher=Princeton University Press|date=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|789}}&lt;ref name="Allison2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Allison|first=Gary|date=2004|title=The Influence of Species Diversity and Stress Intensity on Community Resistance and Resilience|journal=Ecological Monographs|volume=74|issue=1|pages=117–134|jstor=4539048|doi=10.1890/02-0681}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Connell&amp;Sousa"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Connell|first=Joseph H.|author2=Wayne P.

==Stability and disturbance==
Resistance is one of the major aspects of [[ecological stability]]. Volker Grimm and Christian Wissel identified 70 terms and 163 distinct definitions of the various aspects of ecological stability, but found that they could be reduced to three fundamental properties: "staying essentially unchanged", "returning to the reference state...after a temporary disturbance" and "persistence through time of an ecological system". Resistant communities are able to remain "essentially unchanged" despite disturbance.&lt;ref name="Grimm1997"/&gt; Although commonly seen as distinct from [[resilience (ecology)|resilience]], [[Brian Walker (ecologist)|Brian Walker]] and colleagues considered resistance to be a component of resilience in their expanded definition of resilience,&lt;ref name="Walker2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Walker|first=Brian|author2=C.S. Holling |author3=Stephen R. Carpenter |author4= Ann Kinzig |date=2004|title=Resilience, Adaptability and Transformability in Social–ecological Systems|journal=Ecology and Society|volume=9|issue=2|pages=5|url=http://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol9/iss2/art5}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Fridolin Brand used a definition of resilience that he described as "close to the stability concept 'resistance', as identified by Grimm and Wissel (1997)".&lt;ref name="Brand2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brand|first=Fridolin|date=2009|title=Critical natural capital revisited: Ecological resilience and sustainable development|journal=Ecological Economics|volume=68|issue=3|pages=605–612|doi=10.1016/j.ecolecon.2008.09.013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inverse of resistance is sensitivity - sensitive species or communities show large changes when subject to environmental stress or disturbance.&lt;ref name="Grimm1997"/&gt;

==Examples==
In 1988, [[Hurricane Joan]] hit the rainforests along [[Nicaragua]]'s Caribbean coast. [[Douglas Boucher]] and colleagues contrasted the resistant response of ''[[Qualea paraensis]]'' with the [[resilience (ecology)|resilient]] response of ''[[Vochysia ferruginea]]''; the mortality rate was low for ''Q. paraensis'' (despite extensive damage to the trees), but the growth rates of surviving trees were also low and few seedlings established. Despite the disturbance, populations were essentially unchanged. In contrast, ''V. ferruginea'' experienced very high rates of mortality in the hurricane but showed very high rates of seedling recruitment. As a result, population densities of the species increased.&lt;ref name="Boucher1994"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Boucher|first=Douglas H.|author2=John H. Vandermeer |author3=Maria Antonia Mallona |author4=Nelson Zamora |author5= Ivette Perfecto |date=1994|title=Resistance and resilience in a directly regeneration rainforest: Nicaraguan trees of the Vochysiaceae after Hurricane Joan |journal=Forest Ecology and Management|volume=68|pages=127–136 |url=http://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/2027.42/31279/1/0000185.pdf|doi=10.1016/0378-1127(94)90040-x}}&lt;/ref&gt; In their study of [[Jamaica]]n montane forests affected by [[Hurricane Hugo]] in 1988, [[Peter Bellingham]] and colleagues used the degree of hurricane damage and the magnitude of the post-hurricane response to categorise tree species into four groups – resistant species (those with limited storm damage and low response), susceptible species (greater damage but low response), usurpers (limited damage but high response) and resilient species (greater damage and high response).&lt;ref name="Bellingham1995"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bellingham|first=P.J.|author2=E.V.J. Tanner |author3=J.R. Healey |date=1995|title=Damage and responsiveness of Jamaican montane tree species after disturbance by a hurricane|journal=Ecology|volume=76|issue=8|pages=2562–2580|jstor=2265828|doi=10.2307/2265828}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Introduced species==
English ecologist [[Charles Sutherland Elton|Charles Elton]] applied the term resistance to the ecosystem properties which limit the ability of  [[introduced species]] to successfully invade communities. These properties include both [[abiotic factors]] like temperature and drought, and [[biotic factors]] including [[competition (biology)|competition]], predation and the lack of necessary [[mutualism (biology)|mutualists]]. Higher [[species diversity]] and lower resource availability can also contribute to resistance.&lt;ref name="D'Antonio2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last=D'Antonio|first=Carla M.|author2=Meredith Thomsen |date=2004|title=Ecological Resistance in Theory and Practice|journal=Weed Technology|volume=18|issue=sp1|pages=1572–1577|url=http://www.bioone.org/doi/full/10.1614/0890-037X%282004%29018%5B1572%3AERITAP%5D2.0.CO%3B2|doi=10.1614/0890-037X(2004)018[1572:ERITAP]2.0.CO;2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3353">'''Rudi Supek''' ([[Zagreb]], 8 April 1913&amp;nbsp;– Zagreb, 2 January 1993) was a [[Croatia]]n [[sociologist]] and a member of the [[Praxis School]] of Marxism.

Supek studied philosophy in [[Zagreb]] and graduated in 1937. He went to study clinical psychology in [[Paris]], where he was when [[World War II]] erupted. He joined the [[French Resistance|resistance movement]], but soon was captured and deported to the [[Buchenwald concentration camp]], where he took part in the [[Buchenwald Resistance]]. After the liberation, Supek went back to Paris to continue living and studying there. In 1948, after the [[Informbiro]] Resolution against [[Josip Broz Tito]]'s [[Yugoslavia]], the leader of the French Communists [[Maurice Thorez]] asked Supek, who was a member of the [[French Communist Party]], to attack [[Titoism]]. Supek refused to comply and returned to Yugoslavia. However, he did not become a member of the [[Communist Party of Yugoslavia]].

Supek earned his PhD from the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]] in 1952 and started to work as a professor at the Department of Psychology of the [[Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences, University of Zagreb]], and at the Institute for Social Research in Zagreb. He founded the Department of Sociology at the Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences in 1963. Supek became the first president of the Yugoslav Society of Psychologists, and for a period he was the president of the Yugoslav Society of Sociologists.

Supek was chief editor of the journal ''Pogledi'' (''Viewpoints'') which was published from 1952 to 1954. In 1964 Supek and several colleagues from the Zagreb Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences founded the ''Praxis'' journal. Supek was co-editor of the journal from 1967 to 1973. He initiated and became president of the Management Board of the Korčula Summer School.

In 2004, the Croatian Sociological Association established the annual ''Rudi Supek Award'' for achievements in sociology in his honour.

==Major works==

Supek wrote many books and articles ranging from sociology to psychopathology, anthropology, and philosophy. His major works are:

*''Existentialism and Decadence'' (1950)
*''Sociology and Socialism'' (1962)
*''Herbert Spencer and the Biologism in Sociology'' (1965)
*''Humanist Intelligentsia and Politics'' (1969)
*''Social Prejudices'' (1973)
*''Participation, Workers’ Control and Self-management'' (1974)
*''Living after History'' (1986)

'''Scientists for Global Responsibility'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.gn.apc.org/portfolio/webprojects/scientists-global-responsibility | title=Scientists for Global Responsibility | publisher=[[GreenNet]] | location=UK | accessdate=29 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ('''SGR''') in the [[United Kingdom]] promotes the [[Ethics|ethical]] practice and use of [[Science, technology and society|science, design and technology]]. SGR is affiliated to the [[International Network of Engineers and Scientists for Global Responsibility]] (INES).  It is an independent UK-based membership organisation of hundreds of natural scientists, social scientists, engineers, IT professionals and architects.

SGR's work is focused on four main issues: security and disarmament; climate change and energy, including nuclear power; who controls science and technology?; emerging technologies.  The main areas of concern are arms and [[arms control]], including military involvement in UK universities; effect of excessive [[greenhouse gas emission]]s on climate; the nature of war and reducing barbarity; topsoil and water shortages resulting from modern agricultural methods; depletion of species of fish due to [[over-fishing]]; continual spread of [[nuclear weapon]]s, and reduction of occurrence of serious [[nuclear accident]]s.{{fact|date=March 2014}}

SGR evaluates the risk of new science and new technological solutions to older science-based problems and threats, while recognizing the enormous contribution science, design and technology has made to civilisation and human well-being.{{fact|date=March 2014}}

SGR promotes science, design and technology that contribute to peace, social justice and environmental sustainability.

[[Image:Taras Kermauner.jpg|thumb|200px|Taras Kermauner]]
'''Taras Kermauner''' (13 April 1930 – 11 June 2008) was a [[Slovenia]]n [[literary history|literary historian]], [[critic]], [[philosopher]], [[essayist]], [[playwright]] and [[translator]].

==Life==
Taras Kermauner was born in [[Ljubljana]] as the son of the [[Communist Party of Slovenia|Slovene communist]] politician and intellectual Dušan Kermauner. His younger brother, Aleš, was a poet and artist. Taras Kermauner attended the [[Poljane Grammar School|Ljubljana Classical Lyceum]] and later studied [[philosophy]] at the [[University of Ljubljana]], where he graduated in 1954. From 1957-58 he studied in [[Paris]] under the supervision of [[Henri Lefebvre]].{{cn|date=September 2017}}

During his college years, Kermauner started collaborating with a group of Slovene intellectuals and artists who became known as the [[Critical generation]]. They published several magazines, such as ''[[Revija 57]]'' and ''[[Perspektive]]'', which challenged the cultural policies of the [[Titoist]] system in the [[Socialist Republic of Slovenia]]. Among Kermauner's closest collaborators during this period were the writer and playwright [[Dominik Smole]], poet [[Dane Zajc]], essayist and playwright [[Primož Kozak]], literary historian [[Janko Kos]], and sociologist and dissident [[Jože Pučnik]].{{cn|date=September 2017}}

In the early 1960s, Kermauner started a long personal friendship with philosopher and literary theoretician [[Dušan Pirjevec]], who strongly influenced Kermauner's intellectual development. After the mid-1970s, Kermauner grew closer to [[Christianity]] and in the mid-1980s he converted to [[Roman Catholicism]] and left public life. {{cn|date=September 2017}}

He spent his last twenty years in a small village in the [[Karst Plateau|Karst]] region of the [[Slovene Littoral]], dedicating his time to writing and study. He obtained his PhD at the [[University of Sarajevo]] in 1981 with a thesis on the plays of [[Ivan Cankar]]. He dedicated most of his later study to the development of Slovenian theatre and dramatic works, in which he looked for deeper ideological and existential elements. During the same period, he expanded his intellectual interests to the sociological works of [[Raymond Aron]], [[Gilles Deleuze]] and [[Jean Baudrillard]].{{cn|date=September 2017}}

He returned to public life shortly before his death in early 2008. Among other things, he publicly supported the newly founded social liberal party ''[[Zares]]''. He died in Ljubljana in the spring of the same year.{{cn|date=September 2017}}

He was married to the writer [[Alenka Goljevšček]]. Their daughter is poet Aksinja Kermauner. Taras Kermauner was also the father of Matjaž Hanžek, political activist, poet and Slovenian [[Ombudsman]] (2001-07).{{cn|date=September 2017}}

== Work ==
Kermauner was considered the greatest researcher and expert on [[Slovene language|Slovene]] [[drama]]. His life work was a series of [[monograph]]s, published under the common title ''Reconstruction and/or reinterpretation of Slovene drama'', in which he analyzed all Slovene plays.

He also translated several works by [[György Lukács]], and [[Tzvetan Todorov]]'s book ''The Spirit of Enlightenment''.

'''''The Dial''''' was an American magazine published intermittently from 1840 to 1929. In its first form, from 1840 to 1844,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Mary Biggs|title=Women's Literary Journals|journal=The Library Quarterly: Information, Community, Policy|date=January 1983|volume=53|issue=1|jstor=4307573}}&lt;/ref&gt; it served as the chief publication of the [[Transcendentalist]]s. From the 1880s to 1919 it was revived as a political review and literary criticism magazine. From 1920 to 1929 it was an influential outlet for [[modernist literature]] in English.

==Transcendentalist journal==
[[File:The Great Lawsuit.jpg|thumb|July 1843 issue of ''The Dial'', featuring [[Margaret Fuller]]'s "[[Woman in the Nineteenth Century|The Great Lawsuit]]"]]
Members of the [[Transcendental Club|Hedge Club]] began talks for creating a vehicle for their essays and reviews in philosophy and religion in October 1839.&lt;ref name=Gura128&gt;Gura, Philip F. ''American Transcendentalism: A History''. New York: Hill and Wang, 2007: 128. {{ISBN|978-0-8090-3477-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other influential journals, including the ''[[North American Review]]'' and the ''[[Christian Examiner]]'' refused to accept their work for publication.&lt;ref&gt;Slater, Abby. ''In Search of Margaret Fuller''. New York: Delacorte Press, 1978: 51. {{ISBN|978-0-440-03944-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Orestes Brownson]] proposed utilizing his recently established periodical ''Boston Quarterly Review'' but members of the club decided a new publication was a better solution.&lt;ref name=VonMehren120&gt;Von Mehren, Joan. ''Minerva and the Muse: A Life of Margaret Fuller''. Amherst, Massachusetts: [[University of Massachusetts Press]], 1994: 120. {{ISBN|978-1-55849-015-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Frederick Henry Hedge]], [[Theodore Parker]], and [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] were originally considered for the editor role.&lt;ref name=Gura128/&gt; On October 20, 1839, [[Margaret Fuller]] officially accepted the editorship, though she was unable to begin work on the publication until the first week of 1840.&lt;ref name=VonMehren120/&gt; [[George Ripley (transcendentalist)|George Ripley]] served as the managing editor.&lt;ref&gt;Slater, Abby. ''In Search of Margaret Fuller''. New York: Delacorte Press, 1978: 61–62. {{ISBN|978-0-440-03944-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its first issue was published in July 1840 with an introduction by Emerson calling it a "Journal in a new spirit".&lt;ref&gt;Gura, Philip F. ''American Transcendentalism: A History''. New York: Hill and Wang, 2007: 129. {{ISBN|978-0-8090-3477-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this first form, the magazine remained in publication until 1844. Emerson wrote to Fuller on August 4, 1840, of his ambitions for the magazine:

{{quote|I begin to wish to see a different ''Dial'' from that which I first imagined. I would not have it too purely literary. I wish we might make a Journal so broad &amp; great in its survey that it should lead the opinion of this generation on every great interest &amp; read the law on property, government, education, as well as on art, letters, &amp; religion. A great Journal people must read. And it does not seem worth our while to work with any other than sovereign aims. So I wish we might court some of the good fanatics and publish chapters on every head in the whole Art of Living....I know the danger of such latitude of plan in any but the best conducted Journal. It becomes friendly to special modes of reform, partisan, bigoted, perhaps whimsical; not universal &amp; poetic. But our round table is not, I fancy, in imminent peril of party &amp; bigotry, &amp; we shall bruise each the other's whims by the collision.&lt;ref&gt;Emerson, Ralph Waldo. ''Emerson's Prose and Poetry'', ed. Porte and Morris. p. 549&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:Houghton MS Am 1506 (11b) - Cranch.jpg|thumb|"The moral influence of ''The Dial''", a caricature by [[Christopher Pearse Cranch]], ca. 1841-1844]]
The title of the journal, which was suggested by [[Amos Bronson Alcott]], intended to evoke a [[sundial]]. The connotations of the image were expanded upon by Emerson in concluding his editorial introduction to the journal's first issue:

{{quote|And so with diligent hands and good intent we set down our ''Dial'' on the earth. We wish it may resemble that instrument in its celebrated happiness, that of measuring no hours but those of sunshine. Let it be one cheerful rational voice amidst the din of mourners and polemics. Or to abide by our chosen image, let it be such a Dial, not as the dead face of a clock, hardly even such as the Gnomon in a garden, but rather such a Dial as is the Garden itself, in whose leaves and flowers the suddenly awakened sleeper is instantly apprised not what part of dead time, but what state of life and growth is now arrived and arriving.&lt;ref&gt;''The Transcendentalists'', ed. Miller, p. 251&lt;/ref&gt;}}

''The Dial'' was heavily criticized, even by Transcendentalists. Ripley said, "They had expected hoofs and horns while it proved as gentle as any sucking dove".&lt;ref&gt;Golemba, Henry L. ''George Ripley''. Boston: Twayne Publishers, 1977: 59. {{ISBN|978-0-8057-7181-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The journal was never financially stable. In 1843, [[Elizabeth Peabody]], acting as business manager, noted that the journal's income was not covering the cost of printing and that subscriptions totaled just over two hundred.&lt;ref name=Gura130&gt;Gura, Philip F. ''American Transcendentalism: A History''. New York: Hill and Wang, 2007: 130. {{ISBN|978-0-8090-3477-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; It ceased publication in April 1844. [[Horace Greeley]], in the May 25 issue of the ''New-York Weekly Tribune'', reported it as an end to the "most original and thoughtful periodical ever published in this country".&lt;ref name=Gura130/&gt;

==Political review and literary criticism magazine==
After a one-year revival in 1860, the third incarnation of ''The Dial'', this time as a journal of both politics and literary criticism, began publication in 1880. This version of the magazine was founded by [[Francis Fisher Browne]] in Chicago. Browne claimed it to be a legitimate offspring of Emerson and Fuller's ''Dial''. Brown would serve as its editor for over three decades. He envisioned his new literary journal in the genteel tradition of its predecessor, containing book reviews, articles about current trends in the sciences and humanities, and politics, as well as long lists of current book titles. It was in this form that [[Margaret C. Anderson|Margaret Anderson]], soon to be founder of ''[[The Little Review]]'', worked for the magazine. Although Chicago was a city reputedly indifferent to literary pursuits, ''The Dial'' attained national prominence, absorbing ''[[The Chap-Book]]'' in 1898.

Francis Browne died in 1913 after elevating the magazine by its unswerving standard in design and content. Control of the magazine shifted to his siblings, and under their control, the magazine lost prominence because they lacked the editing and managing abilities of Francis. In 1916, rather than continuing the failing magazine, the Browne family sold ''The Dial'' to Martyn Johnson, who "set the magazine on a liberal, even increasingly radical course in politics and the arts as well as in literature."&lt;ref name=Joost4&gt;Joost, Nicholas. ''Scofield Thayer and'' The Dial: ''An Illustrated History''. Carbondale: Southern Illinois University P, 1964: 4&lt;/ref&gt; Although ''The Dial'' was, at the time, a reputable magazine with a noted Midwestern influence, Johnson decided to move to New York in 1918 to distance the magazine from the Midwest and reconnect with the city because many of the magazine's new editors had connections there. Johnson's ''Dial'' soon encountered financial problems, but future editor Scofield Thayer, heir to a New England wool fortune, invested in the magazine.&lt;ref name=Joost6&gt;Joost, Nicholas. ''Scofield Thayer and'' The Dial: ''An Illustrated History''. Carbondale: Southern Illinois University P, 1964: 6&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, Thayer met [[Randolph Bourne]], a contributing editor to ''The Dial.''&lt;ref name=Hoffman198&gt;Hoffman, Frederick, Charles Allen, and Carolyn Ulrich. ''The Little Magazine: A History and a Bibliography''. Princeton: Princeton UP, 1946:198&lt;/ref&gt; Bourne's steadfast pacifism and aesthetic views of art inspired Thayer who reflected these philosophies in his life. After contributing to ''The Dial'' and sinking large sums of money into the company, Thayer hoped for some editorial control of the magazine. Johnson, however, would not yield any responsibilities, causing Thayer to leave the magazine in 1918.

During the latter stages of World War I, Bourne's followers at ''The Dial'' became opponents of John Dewey who advocated absolute violence as the sole means of ending the war. This, coupled with increasing financial problems, nearly ended the magazine. These internal conflicts over ideology and finances caused Johnson to put the magazine up for sale in 1919. Thayer had teamed with a friend from Harvard, James Sibley Watson, Jr., to buy ''The Dial'' late in 1919.&lt;ref name=Hoffman196&gt;Hoffman, Frederick, Charles Allen, and Carolyn Ulrich. ''The Little Magazine: A History and a Bibliography''. Princeton: Princeton UP, 1946:196&lt;/ref&gt; Watson, being an heir to the Western Union fortune, had ample money to buy the magazine with Thayer.&lt;ref name=Joost15&gt;Joost, Nicholas. ''Scofield Thayer and'' The Dial: ''An Illustrated History''. Carbondale: Southern Illinois University P, 1964: 15&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modernist literary magazine==
In 1920, [[Scofield Thayer]] and Dr. [[James Sibley Watson]]. Jr. re-established ''The Dial'' as a [[literary magazine]], the form for which it was most successful and best known. Under Watson's and Thayer's sway ''The Dial'' published remarkably influential artwork, poetry and fiction, including [[William Butler Yeats]]' [[The Second Coming (poem)|"The Second Coming"]] and the first United States publication of [[T. S. Eliot]]'s ''[[The Waste Land]]''. ''The Waste Land'', however, barely made it to the pages of ''The Dial''. [[Ezra Pound]], the magazine's foreign advisor/editor (1920–1923), suggested the poem for publication. Thayer, having never seen the work, approved it for the magazine based on this suggestion and because Eliot had been Thayer's classmate at Oxford.&lt;ref name=Seymour&gt;Seymour-Jones, Carol. ''Painted Shadow: The Life of Vivienne Eliot, First Wife of T. S. Eliot''. New York: Knopf, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Eliot became frustrated, however, at the small amount ''The Dial'' intended to pay for the poem. Thayer was relieved that Eliot was about to pull the deal off the table because he was weary of Eliot's style. Negotiations continued, however, until ''The Dial'' paid Eliot $2130 for the poem,&lt;ref name=Joost161&gt;Joost, Nicholas. ''Scofield Thayer and'' The Dial: ''An Illustrated History''. Carbondale: Southern Illinois University P, 1964: 161&lt;/ref&gt; by also awarding the magazine's second annual prize, which carried an award of $2,000 (£450).&lt;ref&gt;[http://world.std.com/~raparker/exploring/tseliot/reviews/the_dial_award_announcement_1922.html ''The Dial'' magazine's announcement of award to Eliot], Retrieved 28 February 2008&lt;/ref&gt; This was a substantial amount, approximately equal to Eliot's 1922 salary at Lloyds Bank (£500, $2,215),&lt;ref&gt;Eliot's 1922 salary: Gordon 2000 p. 165&lt;/ref&gt; and worth about $90,000 in 2006 dollars.&lt;ref&gt;Williamson, Samuel H. (2007) "Five Ways to Compute the Relative Value of a U.S. Dollar Amount, 1790&amp;ndash;2006", MeasuringWorth.Com&lt;/ref&gt;

The first year of the Watson/Thayer ''Dial'' alone saw the appearance of [[Sherwood Anderson]], [[Djuna Barnes]], [[Kenneth Burke]], [[William Carlos Williams]], [[Hart Crane]], [[E. E. Cummings]], [[Charles Demuth]], [[Kahlil Gibran]], [[Gaston Lachaise]], [[Amy Lowell]], [[Marianne Moore]], [[Ezra Pound]], Arthur Wilson [[later known as Winslow Wilson]], [[Odilon Redon]], [[Bertrand Russell]], [[Carl Sandburg]], [[Van Wyck Brooks]], and [[W. B. Yeats]].

''The Dial'' published art as well as poetry and essays, with artists ranging from [[Vincent van Gogh]], [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir|Renoir]], [[Henri Matisse]], and [[Odilon Redon]], through [[Oskar Kokoschka]], [[Constantin Brâncuși]], and [[Edvard Munch]], and [[Georgia O'Keeffe]] and [[Joseph Stella]]. The magazine also reported on the cultural life of European capitals, writers included T. S. Eliot from London, [[William Kirkpatrick Magee|John Eglinton]] initially from Dublin, but after 1922 reporting on Dublin from a self-imposed exile in England, Ezra Pound from Paris, [[Thomas Mann]] from Germany, and [[Hugo von Hofmannsthal]] from Vienna.

Scofield Thayer was the magazine's editor-in-chief from 1920 to 1926, and Watson was publisher and president from 1920 until its end in 1929. Several managing editors worked for ''The Dial'' during the twenties: Gilbert Seldes (1922–23), Kenneth Burke (1923), Alyse Gregory (1923–25). Due to Thayer's nervous breakdown, he left ''The Dial'' in 1925 and formally resigned in 1926. Marianne Moore, a contributor to ''The Dial'' and advisor, became Managing Editor in 1925. She became the magazine's editor-in-chief upon Thayer's resignation.&lt;ref name=Hoffman200&gt;Hoffman, Frederick, Charles Allen, and Carolyn Ulrich. ''The Little Magazine: A History and a Bibliography''. Princeton: Princeton UP, 1946:200&lt;/ref&gt;

Scofield Thayer's mental health continued to deteriorate, and he was hospitalized in 1927. Around this time, Watson began to delve in avant garde films, leaving Moore to her own auspices as editor-in-chief. Toward the end of the magazine's run, the staff felt that they were staying on because of an obligation to continue rather than a drive to be a strong, modern magazine. When the magazine ended in 1929, the staff was confident that the precedent they set would be carried on by other magazines.

===The Dial Award===
In June 1921, Thayer and Watson announced the creation of the '''Dial Award''', $2000 to be presented to one of its contributors, acknowledging their "service to letters" in hopes of providing the artist with "leisure through which at least one artist may serve God (or go to the Devil) according to his own lights." The first of these awards was granted in January 1922 to Sherwood Anderson for work he had published in the magazine in 1921. Eight Dial Awards were given in all.
* 1921. [[Sherwood Anderson]]
* 1922. [[T. S. Eliot]]
* 1923. [[Van Wyck Brooks]]
* 1924. [[Marianne Moore]]
* 1925. [[E. E. Cummings]]
* 1926. [[William Carlos Williams]]
* 1927. [[Ezra Pound]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2639">'''Vanja Sutlić''' (18 February 1925 – 15 December 1989) was a Croatian philosopher. He was regarded as the father of the [[Heidegger]]ian philosophy in Yugoslavia and its successor states, especially in Croatia and Slovenia.&lt;ref&gt;Vanja Sutlić, ''Delo in moč: razprava'' (Koper: Hyperion, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

He was born in [[Karlovac]], Yugoslavia. He graduated from philosophy at the [[University of Zagreb]], where he also obtained his PhD. In, he was hired as an assistant professor at the University, but in 1952 he was removed by the [[Yugoslav Communist]] authorities and forcibly transferred to [[Nova Gradiška]]. Already in 1953, he could return to Zagreb, continuing his teaching position. Between 1956 and 1964, he taught at the [[University of Sarajevo]]. Between 1964 until his death, he worked as a professor at the Faculty of Political Sciences of the University of Zagreb. He died in [[Zagreb]] in 1989.

Sutlić's main philosophical preoccupation was the thought of the German philosopher [[Martin Heidegger]].&lt;ref&gt;Vanja Sutlić, ''Delo in moč'' (Koper: hyperion, 2009), 41.&lt;/ref&gt; Through Hedeggerian [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], Sutlić engaged in reflections on the modern epoch, which he frequently referred to as "the world of Work". In dialogue with the philosophies of [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], he reflected on the meaning of modern [[nihilism]], and the possibilities of its overcoming.&lt;ref&gt;Vanja Sutlić, ''Delo in moč'' (Koper: Hyperion, 2009), 41.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sutlić's thought influenced several Yugoslav philosophers, including the [[Slovenes]] [[Ivo Urbančič]], [[Veljko Rus]] and [[Tine Hribar]], and the [[Serb]] [[Mihailo Đurić]].

His son, also called [[Vanja Sutlić (director)|Vanja Sutlić]], is a film director and former chairman of the [[Croatian Radiotelevision]].

[[Image:CanadaStatueTruth crop.jpg|thumb|Statue of Veritas outside the [[Supreme Court of Canada]]]]

In [[Roman mythology]], '''Veritas''', meaning ''truth'', is the [[goddess]] of [[truth]], a daughter of Chronos, the God of Time (who has been identified with [[Saturn (mythology)|Saturn-Cronus]], perhaps first by Plutarch), and the mother of [[Virtus (deity)|Virtus]]. She is also sometimes considered the daughter of [[Zeus]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Pindar]] ''Olympian Ode 10'': But come, Muse, you and the daughter of Zeus, unforgettable Truth: with the hand that puts things right, keep from me the blame for lying, for wronging my friend. Approaching from far away, the future has arrived and made me ashamed of my deep debt. Still, payment with interest has a way of dissolving the bitter reproach of men.[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0162%3Abook%3DO.%3Apoem%3D10]&lt;/ref&gt; or a creation of [[Prometheus]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Aesop]] ''[[Aesop's Fables|Fables]]'' 530 (from [[Phaedrus (fabulist)|Phaedrus]] Appendix 5): [[Prometheus]], that potter who gave shape to our new generation, decided one day to sculpt a statue of Truth, using all his skill so that she would be able to regulate people's behaviour. As he was working, an unexpected summons from mighty Jupiter called him away. Prometheus left cunning Trickery in charge of his workshop (Trickery had recently become one of the god's apprentices). Fired by ambition, Trickery used the time at his disposal to fashion with his sly fingers a figure of the same size and appearance as Truth with identical features. When he had almost completed the piece, which was truly remarkable, he ran out of clay to use for her feet. The master returned, so Trickery quickly sat down in his seat, quaking with fear. Prometheus was amazed at the similarity of the two statues and wanted it to seem as if all the credit were due to his own skill. Therefore, he put both statues in the kiln and when they had been thoroughly baked, he infused them both with life: sacred Truth walked with measured steps, while her unfinished twin stood stuck in her tracks.

Veritas is also the name given to the [[Roman virtue]] of [[Honesty|truthfulness]], which was considered one of the main virtues any good Roman should possess. The Greek goddess of truth is [[Aletheia]] ([[Ancient Greek language|Ancient Greek]]: {{lang|grc|ἀλήθεια}}). The German philosopher [[Martin Heidegger]] argues that the truth represented by ''aletheia'' (which essentially means "unconcealment") is different from that represented by ''veritas'', which is linked to a Roman understanding of rightness and finally to a Nietzschean sense of justice and a will to power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=B.

In [[Western culture]], the word may also serve as a [[motto]].

==Mottos==
This [[Latin]] word "''veritas''" now appears in the [[motto]]s of many [[college]]s and [[university|universities]]. It is typically capitalized in mottoes (as "''Veritas''") for being an ideal (such as: Truth, Kindness and Beauty).  ''Veritas'' is the motto of [[Hutchesons' Grammar School]], [[Harvard University]], [[The University of Western Ontario]], [[Drake University]], [[Knox College (Illinois)]], [[Bilkent University]], the University of California - Hastings College of the Law, as well as the [[Dominican Order]] of the [[Roman Catholic Church]], and [[Providence College]] and [[Molloy College]] which is run by the Dominicans. Additionally, the word appears in mottoes that are phrases, or lists e.g. the [[Buckley School (New York City)|Buckley School]] of the [[New York City|City of New York]] employs the phrase ''Honor et Veritas'', the [[University of Indonesia]]'s motto is "Veritas, Probitas, Iustitia", the [[University of Cape Coast]] in [[Ghana]]'s motto is "Veritas Nobis Lumen", the [[University of Michigan]]'s motto is: "Artes, Scientia, Veritas". [[Doshisha University]] in [[Kyoto]], [[Japan]]'s motto is "[[Veritas vos liberabit|Veritas Liberabit Vos]]".

[[Caldwell College]] in [[Caldwell, New Jersey]] issues a "Veritas Award" each year in honor of the [[Dominican Sisters]] who founded and administer the college. "Veritas" is included in the motto of [[Indiana University]] and [[Yale University]], ''Lux et Veritas'' ("Light and Truth"). It also appears on the [[California State University]]'s motto ''Vox Veritas Vita'' ("Speak the Truth as a way of Life"). "[[Veritas vos liberabit]]" ("The Truth Will Set You Free") is the motto of The [[Johns Hopkins University]]. ''Veritas Curat'' ("Truth Cures") is the motto of the [[JIPMER|Jawaharlal Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education and Research]], a medical school in [[Puducherry]], [[India]]. [[Howard University]], in [[Washington, D.C.]], goes by the motto "Veritas et Utilitas", translated to "Truth and Service", which is also a motto "Truth-Service" of [[Payap University]], [[Thailand]]. It also exists in the logo of [[Seoul National University]], Korea: "Veritas Lux Mea" &amp;ndash; meaning "Truth is my light". [[Villanova University]] also uses Veritas in its school motto, ''Veritas, Unitas, Caritas'' ("Truth, Unity, Love"). [[Uppsala University]] in Sweden also uses Veritas in its school motto, "Gratiae veritas naturae".

The [[Naval Criminal Investigative Service]], the U.S. Navy's primary counterintelligence arm and law enforcement agency, uses the motto on its official seal.

'''Vinciane Despret''' is a Belgian [[philosopher of science]], associate professor, at the [[University of Liège]], [[Belgium]].

== Biography ==

Vinciane Despret first graduated in philosophy. She studied psychology and graduated in 1991. She is most known for having provided a reflexive account on [[ethologists]], observing babblers in the [[Negev]] desert and the way they would interpret those birds' complex dance moves.&lt;ref&gt;A short profile introduction is to be found on the website of her editor, "La Découverte", in Paris: http://www.editionsladecouverte.fr/catalogue/index-Les_faiseuses_d_histoires-9782359250473.html&lt;/ref&gt;

She is considered to be a foundational thinker in what has now became the field of [[animal studies]].&lt;ref&gt;For instance, this podcast of Despret interviewing the primatologist [[Thelma Rowell]] — http://backdoorbroadcasting.net/2011/06/vinciane-despret-experimenting-with-politics-and-happiness-through-sheep-cows-and-pigs/&lt;/ref&gt; More generally, at the heart of her work lies the question of the relationship between observers and the observed during the conduct of scientific research.

Despret affiliates herself to such critical thinkers in philosophy and anthropology of science as [[Isabelle Stengers]], [[Donna Haraway]] and [[Bruno Latour]]. She undertakes a critical understanding of how science is fabricated, following scientists doing fieldwork and the way they actively create links and specific relationships to their objects of study.

Although she has mostly published books in French, some of her works are planned to be published in English in the course of late 2012.

'''William A. Earle''' (1919 – October 16, 1988) was a twentieth-century [[United States|American]] philosopher.

Earle was an important figure within the movements of [[existentialism]] and [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]].  He had particular expertise in the thought of [[Karl Jaspers]] and [[Georg W. F. Hegel]] and was an authority on [[surrealism]].  His interests included [[cultural criticism]], the [[history of ideas]], [[aesthetics]], [[film]], [[filmmaking]], and [[mysticism]].  Students and colleagues regarded him as a strikingly independent, richly provocative educator and thinker.

==Life==
Earle was born in [[Saginaw, Michigan]]. After service in World War II, he studied at the [[University of Aix-Marseilles]] under [[Gaston Berger]] and at the [[University of Chicago]] under [[Charles Hartshorne]] and received [[Ph.D.|PhDs]] from both institutions.

From 1948 to 1982 he taught philosophy at [[Northwestern University]], with visiting lectureships at [[Harvard University|Harvard]], [[Yale University|Yale]], and [[Stanford University|Stanford]].  In 1962 Earle, along with  [[John Daniel Wild]], [[James M. Edie]], and others, founded the [http://www.spep.org Society for Phenomenology and Existential Philosophy].

William Earle died in [[Evanston, Illinois|Evanston]], [[Illinois]].&lt;ref&gt;Edward S. Casey, "Memorial Minutes: William Earle 1919-1988," ''Proceedings and Addresses of the American Philosophical Association'', vol. 63, no. 1 (Sep/1989), pp. 31-2.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy==
Earle's thought is infused with an appreciation of the singularity of human existences and with a sensibility that is both aesthetic and ethical.  He wrote that he considered his books ''Objectivity'' (1955), ''The Autobiographical Consciousness'' (1972), and ''Mystical Reason'' (1980) as a continuous set of works in which one idea is examined from three successive points of view.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Mystical Reason'', Appendix V, pp. 201-203.&lt;/ref&gt;  In ''Objectivity'' he defended the objectivity of the being of the phenomenological object.  In ''The Autobiographical Consciousness'' he explored the phenomenological subject, the "I" or self conceived both as an embodied existence and as transcendental.  And in ''Mystical Reason'' he argued, in a "strictly philosophical" way, that the [[transcendental ego]] is identical with absolute being or [[God]] himself, proposing that there is a kind of mysticism at the core of all truly rational philosophy.

==Quotations from Earle's works==

===On the objective reality of the world===
:"The problem of knowledge is essentially, what does mind know?  Does it know what is, or does it know only what it creates in the very act of knowing it?  And the view for which I have argued is that all cognitive consciousness is an acquaintance with what is, or with reality....  The mind does not have to infer its way out of itself; it is always outside itself looking at an object....  If we must have a name for this old idea of the truth, it is perhaps an 'acquaintance' theory.  When we are aware of something, we are not aware of something that 'corresponds' to something else; nor is the awareness itself a correspondence to anything.  Nor is our view that of the coherence theory....  Our analysis finally is metaphysical....  The mind, in its cognitive dimension, intends Being."
::&amp;mdash; ''Objectivity'', pp. 153-7.

===On human nature and human life===
:"The very posing of the question 'What is man?' is itself an invitation to forget who we are."
::&amp;mdash; ''The Autobiographical Consciousness'', p. 91.

:"The laws of perception have been analysed ''ad nauseam''; but my life is not in the least concerned with the ''laws'' of perception, but rather with ''what'' I perceive, and that remains absolutely contingent, accidental, non-deducible, and therefore ''surprising'' in principle....  Surprise also happens to be the condition of jokes, love, zest, and in effect a general synonym for life itself."
::&amp;mdash; "The Invisibility of the World", in ''Evanescence'', p. 59.

===On value theory and ethics===
:"It would be a mistake to divorce the general consideration of value from ontology, by isolating it in some 'value theory.'  Values for me represent the way I finally want to be."
::&amp;mdash; ''The Autobiographical Consciousness'', p. 182.

===On literature===
:"When literature is purest, when it is not trying to do what it cannot do in any case, it never gives a scientific explanation of anything, it delivers no laws of human existence, it neither urges nor threatens us with anything....  At its best, literature simply presents or records singular human existences in their singular situations, making their absolute choices of life."
::&amp;mdash; ''The Autobiographical Consciousness'', p. 95.

===On God and truth===
:"The transcendental ego is... in its essence, the essential intuition of God by God.  This intuition itself constituting the ego may be explicit as in the perfection of mystic experience, or implicit, down through any number of grades of consciousness."
::&amp;mdash; ''Mystical Reason'', p. 100.

:"Truth... is related to ''troth'', which is the same as loyalty or faith.  When true, I am faithful to friends and the God in them and in me....  The passion for truth which men of good will manifest is certainly not a matter of ascertaining the exact chemical composition of water or the number of grains of sand on the beach.  It always was and remains a passion for recognizing and honoring the divinity in oneself and the other."
::&amp;mdash; ''Mystical Reason'', pp. 106-7.

'''William Thompson''' (1775 – 28 March 1833) was an Irish political and [[Philosopher|philosophical]] writer and [[Reform movement|social reformer]], developing from [[utilitarianism]] into an early critic of capitalist exploitation whose ideas influenced the [[Cooperative]], Trade Union and [[Chartism|Chartist]] movements as well as [[Karl Marx]]. Born into the [[Anglo-Irish]] [[Protestant Ascendancy|Ascendancy]] of wealthy landowners and merchants of [[Cork (city)|Cork]] society, his attempt to will his estate to the [[Agricultural cooperative|cooperative movement]] after his death sparked a long court case as his family fought successfully to have the will annulled.&lt;ref&gt;Fintan Lane, ‘William Thompson, bankruptcy and the west Cork estate, 1808-1834′, in Irish Historical Studies, vol. xxxix, no. 153 (May 2014), pp 24–39.&lt;/ref&gt; According to E. T. Craig, this decision to will his estate to the cooperative movement was taken after a visit to the pioneering [[Ralahine]] Commune. Marxist [[James Connolly]] described him as the "first Irish socialist" and  a forerunner to Marx.

== Life ==
Born in [[Cork (city)|Cork]], William was the son and heir of one of the most prosperous merchants of that city, [[Alderman]] John Thompson, who held, amongst other offices, that of Mayor in 1794. William inherited the small trading fleet and landed estate near [[Glandore]], West Cork after his father's death in 1814. Rejecting the role of [[absentee landlord]] commonly led by those of a similar situation, William based his living quarters on the estate and despite many travels, invested much time with the tenants on the estate introducing agricultural innovations, services and education for children aimed at improving the welfare and prosperity of the families present.

Victim of weak health from an early age, Thompson became a non-smoker, teetotaller and vegetarian for the last 13 years of his life. These abstemious habits, he explained, helped him to concentrate on his reading and writing. Nonetheless, by the 1830s, he was suffering from a chest affliction that finally killed him on 28 March 1833. He had never married and left no direct heir.

Thompson was an atheist.&lt;ref&gt;"Such actions established among the Catholic population of the area a long-lived reputation for kindness and fair dealing which persisted despite his professed atheism." Noel Thompson, 'Thompson, William (1775–1833)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 (accessed May 6, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ideas ==
An enthusiastic student of the writers and ideas of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], particularly [[Condorcet]], Thompson became a convinced egalitarian and democrat. His support for the [[French Revolution]] earned him the label of "Red Republican" from Cork society and his support for advocates of Catholic emancipation in elections further alienated him from the rest of his wealthy Protestant kith and kin.

Thompson was greatly impressed by the [[utilitarianism]] of [[Jeremy Bentham]], with whom he corresponded and established a friendship, later staying at the English philosopher's house for several months in 1821–22 while visiting London.
As well as Bentham, Thompson read and corresponded with other utilitarian contemporaries such as [[James Mill]], and was influenced, both positively and negatively, by [[William Godwin]] and [[Thomas Malthus]].
His desire to overcome the limitations of Godwin's "intellectual speculations" and Malthus's "mechanical speculations" led him to propose a new synthesis: [[social science]] – Thompson was the first to introduce this term – which would combine political economy's concern with scientific materialism with utilitarianism's concern with rational morality.

=== Contribution to political economy ===
It was the contrasting ideas of Godwin and Malthus that spurred Thompson into the project of research into the role of distribution in [[political economy]] that led him to London and, in 1824, the publication of ''An Inquiry into the Principles of the Distribution of Wealth'' (see biblio. for full title).{{sfn|Lee|1901}}
Thompson had also become acquainted with the work of the French utopian socialists including [[Charles Fourier]], [[Claude Henri de Rouvroy, Comte de Saint-Simon|Henri Saint-Simon]], and the economist [[Jean Charles Leonard de Sismondi|Sismondi]].

In the ''Inquiry'', Thompson follows the line of the [[labour theory of value]] put forward by [[Adam Smith]].
However he characterizes the appropriation of the lion's share of surplus value by the capitalist owner of the tools of production as exploitation.
He rejects the Malthus/Mill proposition that any increase in the wage of the workers can only result in their further [[immiseration]], noting the self-serving nature of this theory for capitalists pressing for legislation to outlaw workers efforts to raise their wages.
By applying the utilitarian principle of "the greatest good for the greatest number" to the existing and possible alternative schemes of distribution, Thompson comes down on the side of an egalitarian distribution of the product.

One of Thompson's colleagues in the Cooperative movement, [[John Minter Morgan]], made the observation that he was the first to coin the term ''competitive'' to describe the existing economic system. The case for the originality of this work is further made by [[Max Nettlau]] who states: ''"[Thompson's] book, however, discloses his own evolution; having started with a demand for the full product of labour as well as the regulation of distribution, he ended up with his own conversion to communism, that is, unlimited distribution."''

In 1827 fellow "[[Ricardian socialism|Ricardian socialist]]" [[Thomas Hodgskin]] published ''Labour Defended'' which also characterised the appropriation of the lion's share of the fruits of production by landlord and capitalist as exploitation defrauding the worker of the full product of their labour.
However, Hodgskin proposed that the road to economic justice for the labourer was through a reformed competitive system. Thompson replied with ''Labor Rewarded'' defending cooperative communism against Hodgskin's unequal wages.

=== Feminism ===
Although he rejected the political and economic implications of Malthus' essay on population, Thompson recognised that, particularly in Ireland, unrestrained population growth did pose the threat of rising poverty.
As such he was like Bentham and [[Francis Place]] an advocate of the benefits of [[contraception]].
Thompson's development of a critique of the contemporary status of women was most strongly influenced by his long-term close friendship with [[Anna Wheeler (author)|Anna Wheeler]].
He had met Wheeler while staying with Bentham and they moved in those utilitarian circles that included [[James Mill]].
It was the publication of the latter's "On Government" which called for the vote for men only, that aroused the fervent opposition of both Wheeler and Thompson and to the rebuttal in ''Appeal of One Half the Human Race...'' (see Bibliography for full title).{{sfn|Lee|1901}}

=== Influence on cooperative movement ===

==== Opposition to Robert Owen ====
Thompson and others of the [[cooperative|Cooperative movement]] have tended to be somewhat unfairly subsumed under the political label of [[Robert Owen|Owenism]]. In fact, although his writings and social experiments at [[New Lanark]] had helped to bring the cooperative movement together, many, Thompson included, were critical of Owen's authoritarian and anti-democratic tendencies. Thompson further distrusted Owen's courtship of rich and powerful patrons, believing that the rich as a class could never be expected to be in favour of any project of emancipation for the labouring poor as this would threaten their privilege. He also believed in the necessity of the workers in any co-operative community having eventual security of ownership of the community's land and capital property. He gained a considerable following within the cooperative movement for these positions and it was to distinguish themselves from Owen's positions that this wing of the movement began to adopt the label of "socialist or communionist" (Letter to "The Cooperative Magazine", London, November 1827, cited by OED as first documented use of socialist) rather than "Owenist".

These differences led to open confrontation between Thompson and Owen at the Third Cooperative Congress held in 1832 in London.
Owen, perhaps discouraged by the failure of his attempted community at [[New Harmony, Indiana|New Harmony]], maintained that it was necessary to wait for Government and Stock Exchange support and investment into large scale communities.
Thompson and his supporters contended that they must move towards establishing independent small scale communities based on the movement's own resources.
The argument was not resolved at that congress and by the following one Thompson was unable to attend probably as a result of the illness that was to lead to his death in another five months.

=== Influence on Karl Marx ===
[[Karl Marx]] had come across Thompson's work on a visit to Manchester in 1845, and cites it in passing in ''The Poverty of Philosophy'' (1847), and also in ''Capital'' itself.{{sfn|Marx|pp. 397–399}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2378">A '''Wittgenstein's ladder''' is a simplified explanation of a technical or complex subject that is used as a teaching tool, despite being technically wrong.

The term stems from proposition number 6.54 in Austrian philosopher [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]'s 1921 philosophical work ''[[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]]'', in which he states that although his propositions are at some level incorrect, they can be used like steps on a ladder to help one reach an understanding of higher level concepts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://people.umass.edu/klement/tlp/ |title=Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus Side-by-Side-by-Side Edition |publisher=People.umass.edu |accessdate=2014-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|'''6.54'''&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;My propositions serve as elucidations in the following way: anyone who understands me eventually recognizes them as nonsensical, when he has used them—as steps—to climb beyond them. (He must, so to speak, throw away the ladder after he has climbed up it.)&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;He must transcend these propositions, and then he will see the world aright.}}&lt;ref&gt;Original in [[German language|German]]:
{{quote|'''6.54'''&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Meine Sätze erläutern dadurch, dass sie der, welcher mich versteht, am Ende als unsinnig erkennt, wenn er durch sie—auf ihnen—über sie hinausgestiegen ist. (Er muss sozusagen die Leiter wegwerfen, nachdem er auf ihr hinaufgestiegen ist.)&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Er muss diese Sätze überwinden, dann sieht er die Welt richtig.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other philosophers before Wittgenstein including [[Schopenhauer]] and [[Fritz Mauthner]] had used a similar metaphor before him.&lt;ref name=gakis&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://wittgensteinrepository.org/agora-alws/article/view/2891/3506|title=Throwing Away the Ladder Before Climbing it|last=Gakis|first=Dimitris|work=Papers of the 33rd IWS (eds. E. Nemeth, R. Heinrich, W. Pichler)|volume=|issue=|page=|date=2010|accessdate=April 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1930, Wittgenstein rejected his own "ladder" idea, stating:&lt;ref name=gakis/&gt;
{{quote|Anything that can be reached with a ladder does not interest me.}}
