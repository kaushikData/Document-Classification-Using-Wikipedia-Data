      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1118">'''Academic job market''' refers to the pool of vacant teaching and administrative positions in [[Academia]], i.e. in institutions of Higher Education such as universities and colleges, and also to the competition for these positions, and the mechanisms for advertising and filling them. This job market differs somewhat from other job markets because of such institutions as tenure. It is frequently a subject of debate relating to questions of openness, discrimination and [[reverse discrimination]], and political interference.

The Academic job market, like the structure of academic careers, operates somewhat differently in different countries.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10307">The '''Agricultural Science and Technology Indicators (ASTI)''' is a comprehensive source of information on agricultural research and development (R&amp;D) statistics.

==Overview==
ASTI compiles, analyzes, and publicizes data on institutional developments, investments, and capacity trends in agricultural R&amp;D in [[Developing country|low- and middle-income countries]] worldwide. ASTI has published a broad set of country briefs and regional synthesis reports that describe general human and financial capacity trends in agricultural [[Research and development|R&amp;D]] at national, regional, and global levels. 

ASTI comprises a network of national, regional, and international agricultural R&amp;D agencies and is hosted and facilitated by the [[International Food Policy Research Institute]] (IFPRI). ASTI is currently funded by the [[Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation]].

==Importance of agricultural R&amp;D data==

Greater investment in [[Agricultural science|agricultural research]] could make a  significant contribution to increasing agricultural production to the levels required to feed the [[World population|world’s growing population]]. Furthermore, additional investments in agricultural research are required to address emerging challenges, such as increasing weather variability, adaptation to [[Global warming|climate change]], [[Water stress|water scarcity]], and increased price volatility in global markets. Despite this growing attention to the agricultural sector and the role of agricultural research, many low- and middle-income countries continue to struggle with serious and deepening capacity and funding constraints in their agricultural research and higher education systems. 

Quantitative information is fundamental to understanding the contribution of agricultural science and technology (S&amp;T) to agricultural growth. Indicators derived from such information allow the performance, inputs, and outcomes of agricultural S&amp;T systems to be measured, monitored, and benchmarked. These indicators assist S&amp;T stakeholders in formulating policy, setting priorities, and undertaking strategic planning, monitoring, and evaluation. They also provide information to governments, policy research institutes, universities, and private-sector organizations involved in public debate on the state of agricultural S&amp;T at national, regional, and international levels.

==Activities==

ASTI’s recent work has primarily focused on the following activities:
* initiating institutional survey rounds in [[Subsaharan Africa]], [[Latin America]] and the [[Caribbean]], the [[Asia Pacific]], and the [[Middle East]] and [[North Africa]];
* developing and maintaining a comprehensive, [http://www.asti.cgiar.org user-friendly website] offering access to primary data sources; and
* building a network of national, regional and international partners to facilitate data collection efforts and the dissemination of outputs.

===Products===

[[Image:ASTI-DataTool-snapshot.jpg|thumb|right|300x300px|Screenshot of the ASTI Datatool]]
In 2009 ASTI launched a [http://www.asti.cgiar.org/data/ web application] that allows its users to display different ASTI indicators by country and plot two indicators against each other.

ASTI’s current indicators include
* trend data on agricultural scientist numbers and total investments in agricultural research by the government, higher education, and nonprofit sectors of developing countries; and
* additional short-term or yearly data on numbers of scientists by degree status and gender, support-staff numbers, funding sources, categories of spending (salaries, operating costs, and capital investments), and research focus by agricultural subsector and theme, as well as by crop and livestock item.

Publications include regional and global analyses of agricultural R&amp;D investments, and country briefs and fact sheets presenting national data.

===How does ASTI collect its data?===

ASTI’s methodology is unique in that it combines first-hand data from a wide range of agricultural R&amp;D agencies in low- and middle-income countries with relevant, secondary data on [[Developed country|high-income countries]] for comparative purposes. 

ASTI datasets are collected and processed using internationally accepted definitions and statistical procedures developed by the [[OECD|Organisation for Economic Co-operation (OECD)]] and the [[UNESCO|United Nations Educational, Science, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO)]]. ASTI relies on its in-country partners to identify all agencies involved in agricultural R&amp;D, to disseminate ASTI survey forms to them, and to coordinate the necessary follow-up.

==Results and Impacts==

[[Image:Total-AgResearch-Spending.jpg|thumb|left|300x300px|Chart showing total spending on agricultural research]]
In 2000, the world spent 39.5 billion dollars (in 2005 PPP prices, that is in inflation-adjusted terms) on agricultural R&amp;D. The '''private''' sector was estimated to account for 41 percent of this total, the vast majority of which was performed in industrialized countries (96 percent). In contrast, only 6 percent of total investments in the developing world were derived from private firms. 

[[Image:Total-Public-AgResearch-Spending.doc.jpg|thumb|right|400x400px|Total public agricultural research expenditures by income class and region, 1981 and 2000]]
In 2000, global '''public''' agricultural research investments totaled $23 billion in 2005 PPP dollars. This sum represents a 47 percent increase over the 1981 total of $16 billion. Although spending by the high-income countries as a whole continued to grow in absolute terms, their share of global spending decreased from 62 to 57 percent over the 1981-2000 period. In contrast, the share of spending by low-income countries increased from 9 to 11 percent and the share of middle-income countries increased from 29 to 32 percent over the same timeframe. Of the 2000 global total, the developing countries in the Asia-Pacific region combined invested $4.8 billion in 2000, compared to $2.7 billion for Latin America and the Caribbean, $1.2 billion for West Asia and North Africa, and $1.2 billion for Sub-Saharan Africa. Agricultural R&amp;D spending for China and the Asia-Pacific region as a whole has grown considerably since 2000. After a period of declining investments in public agricultural R&amp;D, the Latin America and the Caribbean region also experienced an increase in total agricultural R&amp;D spending in 2006, comparable to the mid-1990s level.

The government sector is still providing most of the funding to agricultural research in the developing world, but funding sources can differ tremendously at the country level. Donor funding still plays an important role in most Sub-Saharan African countries and a handful of countries in Asia. In 2000/01 the main government agricultural research agencies in 23 Sub-Saharan African countries for which data were available obtained 35 percent of their funding through donor loans and contributions, which was considerably higher than the corresponding shares in the other regions. Funding generated through internally generated funds, including contractual arrangements with private and public enterprises, as well as funding by producer organizations have gained prominence in recent years across the developing world.

The institutional composition of agricultural R&amp;D has become increasingly diversified over the past few decades. Although the government sector continues to dominate the execution of public agricultural research, the higher-education sector has gained prominence in a large number of developing countries. Despite the increasing share of the higher-education sector as a whole, the individual capacity of many individual higher-education agencies remains small. Nonprofit organizations such as producer organizations, marketing boards, foundations, and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) are increasingly relevant elements of national and global agricultural research. Although in absolute numbers—total FTE researchers more than doubled in LAC and SSA during their respective periods—they continue to account for a small share of public agricultural research.

'''Angle-resolved low-coherence interferometry''' ('''a/LCI''') is an emerging{{when|date=May 2016}} [[medical imaging|biomedical imaging]] technology which uses the properties of [[scattering|scattered light]] to measure the average size of cell structures, including [[cell nucleus|cell nuclei]]. The technology shows promise as a clinical tool for ''[[In situ#Biology|in situ]]'' detection of [[dysplasia|dysplastic]], or [[Carcinoma in situ|precancerous]] tissue.

==Introduction==

A/LCI combines [[optical interferometry#Low-coherence interferometry|low-coherence interferometry]] with angle-resolved [[scattering]] to solve the [[inverse problem]] of determining scatterer geometry based on [[far field]] diffraction patterns. Similar to optical coherence domain reflectometry (OCDR) and [[optical coherence tomography]] (OCT), a/LCI uses a broadband light source in an [[interferometry]] scheme in order to achieve optical sectioning with a depth resolution set by the [[coherence length]] of the source. Angle-resolved scattering measurements capture [[light]] as a function of the scattering angle, and invert the angles to deduce the average size of the scattering objects via a [[Light scattering by particles|computational light scattering model]] such as [[Mie theory]], which predicts angles based on the size of the scattering [[sphere]]. Combining these techniques allows construction of a system that can measure average scatter size at various depths within a [[Biopsy|tissue sample]].

At present the most significant medical application of the technology is determining the state of tissue health based on measurements of average cell nuclei size. It has been found that as tissue changes from normal to cancerous, the average cell nuclei size increases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi= 10.1016/j.gie.2006.10.016|title= In situ detection of nuclear atypia in Barrett's esophagus by using angle-resolved low-coherence interferometry|pmid= 17321252|year= 2007|last1= Pyhtila|first1= J|last2= Chalut|first2= K|last3= Boyer|first3= J|last4= Keener|first4= J|last5= Damico|first5= T|last6= Gottfried|first6= M|last7= Gress|first7= F|last8= Wax|first8= A|journal= Gastrointestinal Endoscopy|volume= 65|issue= 3|pages= 487–91}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several recent studies &lt;ref name='Wax1'&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1117/1.2102767|title=Prospective grading of neoplastic change in rat esophagus epithelium using angle-resolved low-coherence interferometry|pmid=16292952|year=2005|last1=Wax|first1=Adam|last2=Pyhtila|first2=John W.|last3=Graf|first3=Robert N.|last4=Nines|first4=Ronald|last5=Boone|first5=Charles W.|last6=Dasari|first6=Ramachandra R.|last7=Feld|first7=Michael S.|last8=Steele|first8=Vernon E.|last9=Stoner|first9=Gary D.|journal=Journal of Biomedical Optics|volume=10|issue=5|pages=051604}}&lt;/ref&gt; have shown that via cell nuclei measurements, a/LCI can detect the presence of low- and high-grade dysplasia with 91% sensitivity and distinguish between normal and dysplastic with 97% specificity.

==History==

Since 2000, light scattering systems have been used for biomedical applications such as the study of cellular [[morphology (biology)|morphology]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1109/2944.983289|title=Measuring cellular structure at submicrometer scale with light scattering spectroscopy|year=2001|last1=Backman|first1=V.|last2=Gopal|first2=V.|last3=Kalashnikov|first3=M.|last4=Badizadegan|first4=K.|last5=Gurjar|first5=R.|last6=Wax|first6=A.|last7=Georgakoudi|first7=I.|last8=Mueller|first8=M.|last9=Boone|first9=C.W.|displayauthors=8|journal=IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics|volume=7|pages=887–893|issue=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the diagnosis of [[dysplasia]].&lt;ref name='Wallace'&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1053/gast.2000.16511|pmid=10982761|title=Endoscopic Detection of Dysplasia in Patients with Barrett's Esophagus Using Light-Scattering Spectroscopy|first9=I|last9=Itzkan|first8=SJ|last8=Shields|first7=K|last7=Badizadegan|first6=M|last6=Seiler|first5=M|last5=Fitzmaurice|first4=JM|last4=Crawford|first3=V|last3=Backman|first2=LT|year=2000|last2=Perelman|last1=Wallace|first1=M|displayauthors=8|journal=Gastroenterology|volume=119|issue=3|pages=677–82}}&lt;/ref&gt; Variations in scattering distributions as a function of [[angle]] or [[wavelength]] have been used to deduce information regarding the size of cells and subcellular objects such as nuclei and [[organelle]]s. These size measurements can then be used diagnostically to detect tissue changes—including [[neoplasia|neoplastic]] changes (those leading to cancer).

Light scattering spectroscopy has been used to detect dysplasia in the [[Colon (anatomy)|colon]], [[bladder]], [[cervix]], and [[esophagus]] of human patients.&lt;ref name='Wax1' /&gt; Light scattering has also been used to detect [[Barrett’s esophagus]], a metaplastic condition with a high probability of leading to dysplasia.&lt;ref name='Lovat'&gt;L. B. Lovat, D. Pickard, M. Novelli, P. M. Ripley, J. Francis, I. J. Bigio, and S. G. Bown, "A novel optical biopsy technique using elastic scattering spectroscopy for dysplasia and cancer in Barrett’s esophagus," ''Gastrointestinal Endoscopy'', vol. 51, p. Ab227, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in contrast with a/LCI, these techniques all rely on total intensity based measurements, which lack the ability to provide results as a function of depth in the tissue.

===Early a/LCI models===

[[File:Interferometer.svg|thumb|right|250px|Path of [[light]] in a Michelson interferometer.]]The first implementation of a/LCI&lt;ref name='Wax2'&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1364/JOSAA.19.000737|pmid=11934166|year=2002|last1=Wax|first1=A|last2=Yang|first2=C|last3=Backman|first3=V|last4=Kalashnikov|first4=M|last5=Dasari|first5=RR|last6=Feld|first6=MS|title=Determination of particle size by using the angular distribution of backscattered light as measured with low-coherence interferometry|volume=19|issue=4|pages=737–44|journal=[[Journal of the Optical Society of America A]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; used a [[Michelson interferometer]], the same model used in the famous [[Michelson-Morley experiment]]. The Michelson interferometer splits one beam of light into two paths, one reference path and one sampling path, and recombines them again to produce a waveform resulting from [[Interference (wave propagation)|interference]]. The difference between the reference beam and the sampling beam thus reveal the properties of the sample in the way it scatters light.

The early a/LCI device used a movable mirror and lens in the reference arm so that researchers could replicate different angles and depths in the reference beam as they occurred in the collected backscattered light. This allowed isolation of the backscattered light at varying depths of reflection in the sample. 
In order to transform the data into measurements of cell structure, angular scattering distributions are then compared to the predictions of [[Mie theory]]—which calculates the size of spheres relative to their light scattering patterns.

The a/LCI technique was first validated in studies of polystyrene microspheres,&lt;ref name='Wax2' /&gt; the sizes of which were known and relatively homogeneous. A later study expanded the signal processing method to compensate for the nonspherical and inhomogeneous nature of cell nuclei.&lt;ref name='Yang3'&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0006-3495(02)75571-9|pmc=1302018|pmid=11916880|title=Cellular organization and substructure measured using angle-resolved low-coherence interferometry|first7=MS|last7=Feld|first6=RR|last6=Dasari|first5=CW|last5=Boone|first4=K|last4=Badizadegan|first3=V|last3=Backman|first2=C|year=2002|last2=Yang|last1=Wax|first1=A|journal=Biophysical Journal|volume=82|issue=4|pages=2256–64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This early system required up to 40 minutes to acquire the data for a 1&amp;nbsp;mm² point in a sample, but proved the feasibility of the idea.

===Fourier-domain implementation===

[[File:ALCI Fourier domain results.JPG|thumb|150px|left|Example results of Fourier-domain a/LCI]]
Like OCT, the early implementations of a/LCI relied on physically changing the [[optical path length]] (OPL) to control the depth in the sample from which data are acquired. However, it has been demonstrated&lt;ref name='Choma'&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1364/OE.11.002183|url=http://authors.library.caltech.edu/3312/01/CHOoe03.pdf|pmid=19466106|year=2003|last1=Choma|first1=M|last2=Sarunic|first2=M|last3=Yang|first3=C|last4=Izatt|first4=J|title=Sensitivity advantage of swept source and Fourier domain optical coherence tomography|volume=11|issue=18|pages=2183–9|journal=Optics Express}}&lt;/ref&gt; that it is possible to use a [[Fourier domain]] implementation to yield depth resolution in a single data acquisition. A [[broadband]] light source is used to produce a spectrum of wavelengths at once, and the backscattered light is collected by a [[coherence (physics)|coherent]] [[optical fiber]] in the return path to capture different scattering angles simultaneously.&lt;ref name='Pyhtila'&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1364/OL.31.000772|pmid=16544619|title=Fourier-domain angle-resolved low coherence interferometry through an endoscopic fiber bundle for light-scattering spectroscopy|year=2006|last1=Pyhtila|first1=John W.|last2=Boyer|first2=Jeffrey D.|last3=Chalut|first3=Kevin J.|last4=Wax|first4=Adam|journal=Optics Letters|volume=31|issue=6|pages=772–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Intensity is then measured via a [[spectrometer]]: a single frame from the spectrometer contains scattering intensity as a function of [[wavelength]] and angle. Finally the data is [[Fourier transform]]ed on a line-by-line basis to generate scattering intensity as a function of OPL and angle. In the resulting image, the x axis represents the OPL and the y axis the angle of reflection, thus yielding a 2D map of reflection intensities.

Using this method, the acquisition speed is limited only by the integration time of the spectrometer and can be as short at 20 ms. The same data that initially required tens of minutes to acquire can be acquired ~10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; times faster.&lt;ref name='Pyhtila' /&gt;

==Schematic description==

[[File:ALCI Schematic.PNG|thumb|right|380px|Schematic of a/LCI system. Light is provided by [[superluminescent diode|SLD]], sample and reference light are generated by fiber splitter (FS), while [[lens (optics)|lenses]] L2, L3, and L4 provide [[collimated light|collimation]]. The [[beam splitting|beamsplitter]] (BS) combines sample and reference arm light, which is then incident on the imaging [[spectrometer]]. On the right is the [[Optics|optical geometry]] of probe tip with illumination fiber (DF), lens L1, and collection fiber (FB).]]The Fourier-domain version of the a/LCI system uses a [[superluminescent diode]] (SLD) with a fiber-coupled output as the light source. A fiber splitter separates the signal path at 90% intensity and the reference path at 10%.

The light from the SLD passes through an [[optical isolator]] and subsequently a [[polarizer|polarization controller]]. It has been shown that control of light polarization is important for maximizing optical signal and comparing angular scattering with the Mie scattering model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1364/AO.46.001735|pmid=17356616|title=Polarization effects on scatterer sizing accuracy analyzed with frequency-domain angle-resolved low-coherence interferometry|year=2007|last1=Pyhtila|first1=John W.|last2=Wax|first2=Adam|journal=Applied Optics|volume=46|issue=10|pages=1735–41}}&lt;/ref&gt; A polarization-maintaining fiber is used to carry the illumination light to the sample. A second polarization controller is similarly used to control the polarization of the light passing through the reference path.

The output of the fiber on the right is [[collimated light|collimated]] using lens L1 and illuminates the tissue. But because the delivery fiber is offset from the optical axis of the lens, the beam is delivered to the sample at an oblique angle. Backscattered light is then collimated by the same lens and collected by the fiber bundle. The fibers are one focal length from the lens, and the sample is one focal length on the other side. This configuration captures light from the maximum range of angles and minimizes light noise due to specular reflections.

At the distal end of the fiber bundle, light from each fiber is imaged onto the spectrometer. Light from the sample and reference arms are mixed by a [[beam splitter|beamsplitting]] cube (BS), and are incident on the entrance slit of an imaging spectrometer. Data from the imaging spectrometer are transferred to a computer via [[universal serial bus]] interface for signal processing and display of results. The computer also provides control of the imaging spectrometer.

==Clinical device prototype==
[[File:Alci clinical picture.jpg|thumb|295px|left|Picture of portable a/LCI system with handheld fiber probe on the right and the optical engine on the left. The computer is not shown.]]The a/LCI system has recently been enhanced to allow operation in a [http://www.oncoscope.com clinical setting] with the addition of a handheld wand. By carefully controlling the polarization in the delivery fiber, using polarization-maintaining fibers and inline polarizers, the new system allows manipulation of the handheld wand without signal degradation due to birefringence effects. In addition, the new system employed an [[Anti-reflective coating|anti-reflection coated]] ball lens in the probe tip, which reduces reflections that otherwise limit the depth range of the system.

The portable system uses a 2&amp;nbsp;ft by 2&amp;nbsp;ft [[optical table|optical breadboard]] as the base, with the source, fiber optic components, lens, beamsplitter, and imaging spectrometer mounted to the breadboard. An aluminum cover protects the optics. A fiber probe with a handheld probe enables easy access to tissue samples for testing. On the left side sits a white sample platform, where tissue is placed for testing. The handheld probe is used by the operator to select specific sites on the tissue from which a/LCI readings are acquired.

A '''biorhythm''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]] βίος - ''bios'', "life"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dbi%2Fos1 βίος], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; and ῥυθμός - ''rhuthmos'', "any regular recurring motion, rhythm"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dr%28uqmo%2Fs ῥυθμός], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt;) is an attempt to predict various aspects of a person's life through simple mathematical cycles. The theory was developed by [[Wilhelm Fliess]] in the late 19th century, and was popularized in the United States in late 1970s.

XYZ|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;|thumb]]According to the theory of biorhythms, a person's life is influenced by rhythmic biological cycles that affect his or her ability in various domains, such as mental, physical and emotional activity. These cycles begin at birth and oscillate in a steady (sine wave) fashion throughout life, and by modeling them mathematically, it is suggested that a person's level of ability in each of these domains can be predicted from day to day. The theory is built on the idea that the [[biofeedback]] chemical and hormonal secretion functions within the body could show a sinusoidal behavior over time.

Most biorhythm models use three cycles: a 23-day physical cycle, a 28-day emotional cycle, and a 33-day intellectual cycle.&lt;ref&gt;These cycles are to be adjusted based on the person's personal day clock which may run from 22 hours to 27 hours although 23-25 is the norm. Two ways you can find your personal day clock is grip test and body temperature every 15 minutes for a few days or easier same time each day for a few months.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the 28-day cycle is the same length as the average woman's [[menstrual cycle]] and was originally described as a "female" cycle (see below), the two are not necessarily in synchronization. Each of these cycles varies between high and low extremes sinusoidally, with days where the cycle crosses the zero line described as "critical days" of greater risk or uncertainty.

The numbers from +100% (maximum) to -100% (minimum) indicate where on each cycle the rhythms are on a particular day. In general, a rhythm at 0% is crossing the midpoint and is thought to have no real impact on your life, whereas a rhythm at +100% (at the peak of that cycle) would give you an edge in that area, and a rhythm at -100% (at the bottom of that cycle) would make life more difficult in that area. There is no particular meaning to a day on which your rhythms are all high or all low, except the obvious benefits or hindrances that these rare extremes are thought to have on your life.

In addition to the three popular cycles, various other cycles have been proposed, based on [[linear combination]] of the three, or on longer or shorter rhythms.&lt;ref name="skepdic.com"&gt;http://www.skepdic.com/biorhyth.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Calculation===
Theories published state the equations for the cycles as:
* physical: &lt;math&gt;\sin(2\pi t/23)&lt;/math&gt;,
* emotional: &lt;math&gt;\sin(2\pi t/28)&lt;/math&gt;,
* intellectual: &lt;math&gt;\sin(2\pi t/33)&lt;/math&gt;,
where &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; indicates the number of days since birth. Basic arithmetic shows that the combination of the simpler 23- and 28-day cycles repeats every 644 days (or 1-3/4 years), while the triple combination of 23-, 28-, and 33-day cycles repeats every 21,252 days (or 58.18+ years).

The notion of periodic cycles in human fortunes is ancient; for instance, it is found in [[natal astrology]] and in folk beliefs about "lucky days". The 23- and 28-day rhythms used by biorhythmists, however, were first devised in the late 19th century by [[Wilhelm Fliess]], a Berlin physician and patient of [[Sigmund Freud]]. Fliess believed that he observed regularities at 23- and 28-day intervals in a number of phenomena, including births and deaths. He labeled the 23-day rhythm "male" and the 28-day rhythm "female", matching the menstrual cycle.

In 1904, Viennese psychology professor Hermann Swoboda came to similar conclusions.  Alfred Teltscher, professor of engineering at the University of Innsbruck, developed Swoboda's work and suggested that his students' good and bad days followed a rhythmic pattern; he believed that the brain's ability to absorb, mental ability, and alertness ran in 33-day cycles.&lt;ref name="skepdic.com"/&gt; One of the first academic researchers of biorhythms was [[Estonia]]n-born [[Nikolai Pärna]], who published a book in German called ''Rhythm, Life and Creation'' in 1923.

The practice of consulting biorhythms was popularized in the 1970s by a series of books by [[Bernard Gittelson]], including ''Biorhythm — A Personal Science'', ''Biorhythm Charts of the Famous and Infamous'', and ''Biorhythm Sports Forecasting''. Gittelson's company, Biorhythm Computers, Inc., made a business selling personal biorhythm charts and calculators, but his ability to predict sporting events was not substantiated.&lt;ref&gt;Hoffmann, Frank W., and William G. Bailey, ''Mind and Society Fads'', 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

Charting biorhythms for personal use was popular in the [[United States]] during the 1970s; many places (especially [[video arcade]]s and amusement areas) had a biorhythm machine that provided charts upon entry of date of birth. Biorhythm programs were a common application on [[personal computer]]s; and in the late 1970s, there were also handheld biorhythm calculators on the market, the ''Kosmos 1'' and the [[Casio]] ''Biolator''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vintage-technology.info/pages/calculators/k/kosmos1.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://mycalcdb.free.fr/main.php?l=0&amp;id=326&lt;/ref&gt; Biorhythm charts appeared in the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' from 1977 to 1979, and Gittelson wrote daily biorhythm charts for the ''[[Toronto Star]]'' from 1981 to 1985.&lt;ref name="vice"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Heisel|first1=Andrew|title=Biorhythms: The 1970s Fad That Won a Super Bowl, Killed Clark Gable, and Made America Gaga for Computers {{!}} VICE Sports|url=https://sports.vice.com/en_us/article/biorhythms-the-1970s-fad-that-won-a-super-bowl-killed-clark-gable-and-made-america-gaga-for-computers|accessdate=27 December 2016|work=VICE Sports|date=15 September 2015|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although biorhythms have declined in popularity ([[popular culture|pop culture]] magazine [[Vice (magazine)|''Vice'']] considered them "dead" by the mid 2010s&lt;ref name="vice"/&gt;), there are free and proprietary [[Mobile app|app]]s and [[computer program]]s which have charting and analysis capabilities, as well as numerous websites that offer free biorhythm readings.

==Critical views==

There have been some three dozen studies supporting biorhythm theory, but according to a study by [[Terence Hines]], all of those had methodological and statistical errors.&lt;ref name='Hines_review'&gt;{{cite journal|title=Comprehensive Review of Biorhythm Theory |journal=Psychological Reports |year=1998 |first=Terence |last=Hines |volume=83 |pages=19–64 |doi=10.2466/PR0.83.5.19-64 |url=http://ammonsscientific.com/link.php?N=10326 |format=PDF (summary) |accessdate=2008-01-13 |pmid=9775660 |issue=1 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090212181753/http://ammonsscientific.com/link.php?N=10326 |archivedate=February 12, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hines rejected 134 biorhythm studies and concluded that the theory is not valid.&lt;ref name="Hines_review"/&gt;

Supporters continued to defend the theory after Hines' review, causing other scientists to consider the field as pseudoscience:
{{quote|text=An examination of some 134 biorhythm studies found that the theory is not valid (Hines, 1998). It is empirically testable and has been shown to be false. Terence Hines believes that this fact implies that biorhythm theory 'can not be properly termed a pseudoscientific theory'. However, when the advocates of an empirically testable theory refuse to give up the theory in the face of overwhelming evidence against it, it seems reasonable to call the theory pseudoscientific. For, in fact, the adherents to such a theory have declared by their behaviour that there is nothing that could falsify it, yet they continue to claim the theory is scientific. (from Carroll's "The Skeptic's Dictionary")&lt;ref name=ploch/&gt;{{rp|175}}}}

The physiologist [[Gordon Stein]] in the book ''Encyclopedia of Hoaxes'' (1993) has written: "Both the theoretical underpinning and the practical scientific verification of biorhythm theory are lacking. Without those, biorhythms became just another pseudoscientific claim that people are willing to accept without required evidence. Those pushing biorhythm calculators and books on a gullible public are guilty of making fraudulent claims. They are hoaxers of the public if they know what they are saying has no factual justification."&lt;ref&gt;[[Gordon Stein|Stein, Gordon]]. (1993). ''Encyclopedia of Hoaxes''. Gale Group. p. 161. {{ISBN|0-8103-8414-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1978 study of the incidence of industrial accidents found neither empirical nor theoretical support for the biorhythm model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 662540 | doi=10.2466/pms.1978.46.2.423 | volume=46 | title=No evidence for relationship between biorhythms and industrial accidents | journal=Percept Mot Skills | pages=423–6 | last1 = Persinger | first1 = MA | last2 = Cooke | first2 = WJ | last3 = Janes | first3 = JT}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Charles Alexander Shain''' (6 February 1922 &amp;ndash; 11 February 1960) was an [[Australia]]n pioneer in the field of [[radio astronomy]].

Shain entered the [[University of Melbourne]] in 1940, studying physics, where he won a non-resident Exhibition to [[Trinity College (University of Melbourne)|Trinity College]]. In 1942, for his final year, he moved into residence at Trinity on a Council Minor Scholarship, graduating at the end of the year with a BSc.&lt;ref&gt;"Obituaries", ''[http://www.trinity.unimelb.edu.au/Media/docs/fleur-de-lys-1960-de936db7-094e-4e3c-93c0-90d317e84d3f-0.pdf The Fleur-de-Lys]'', Nov. 1960, p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; 

With Australia at war, Shain joined the [[Second Australian Imperial Force]], but was discharged in 1943 on medical grounds. He then worked on radio countermeasures at the Australian [[Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation]] (CSIRO) Radiophysics Laboratory. Following the war, he entered the field of decametre [[radio astronomy]]. He was a pioneer in the study of absorption in [[H II region]]s as well as the effects of the [[ionosphere]] on radio signals. He died of cancer, leaving behind a wife and three children.&lt;ref name=qjras1_244/&gt;&lt;ref name=atfn55/&gt;

'''Congruence bias''' is a type of [[cognitive bias]] similar to [[confirmation bias]]. Congruence bias occurs due to people's overreliance on directly testing a given [[hypothesis]] as well as neglecting indirect testing.

==Examples==
Suppose that, in an [[experiment]]al setting, a subject is presented with two buttons and told that pressing one of those buttons, but not the other, will open a door. The subject adopts the hypothesis that the button on the left opens the door in question. A direct test of this hypothesis would be pressing the button on the left; an indirect test would be pressing the button on the right. The latter is still a valid test because once the result of the door's remaining closed is found, the left button is proven to be the desired button. (This example is parallel to Bruner, Goodnow, and Austin's example in the psychology classic, ''[[#CITEREFBrunerGoodnowAustin1956|A Study of Thinking]]''.)

It is possible to take this idea of direct and indirect testing and apply it to more complicated experiments in order to explain the presence of a congruence bias in people. In an experiment, a subject will test his own usually naive hypothesis again and again instead of trying to disprove it.

The classic example of subjects' congruence bias was discovered by [[Peter Cathcart Wason|Peter Wason]] ([[#CITEREFWason1960|1960]], [[#CITEREFWason1968|1968]]).  Here, the experimenter gave subjects the number sequence "2, 4, 6", telling the subjects that this sequence followed a particular rule and instructing subjects to find the rule underlying the sequence logic. Subjects provided their own number sequences as tests to see if they could ascertain the rule dictating which numbers could be included in the sequence and which could not. Most subjects respond to the task by quickly deciding that the underlying rule is "numbers ascending by 2", and provide as tests only sequences concordant with this rule, such as "3, 5, 7," or even "pi plus 2, plus 4, plus 6". Each of these sequences follows the underlying rule the experimenter is thinking of, though "numbers ascending by 2" is not the actual criterion being used. However, because subjects succeed at repeatedly testing the same singular principle, they naively believe their chosen hypothesis is correct. When a subject offers up to the experimenter the hypothesis "numbers ascending by 2" only to be told he is wrong, much confusion usually ensues. At this point, many subjects attempt to change the wording of the rule without changing its meaning, and even those who switch to indirect testing have trouble letting go of the "+ 2" convention, producing potential rules as idiosyncratic as "the first two numbers in the sequence are random, and the third number is the second number plus two". Many subjects never realize that the actual rule the experimenter was using was simply just to list ascending numbers, because of the subjects' inability to consider indirect tests of their hypotheses.

==Cognitive basis==
Wason attributed this failure of subjects to an inability to consider alternative hypotheses, which is the root of the congruence bias. [[Jonathan Baron]] explains that subjects could be said to be using a "congruence heuristic", wherein a hypothesis is tested only by thinking of results that would be found if that hypothesis is true. This heuristic, which many people seem to use, ignores alternative hypotheses.

Baron suggests the following heuristics to avoid falling into the congruence bias trap:
# Ask "How likely is a yes answer, if I assume that my hypothesis is false?" Remember to choose a test that has a high probability of giving some answer if the hypothesis is true, and a low probability if it is false.
# "Try to think of alternative hypotheses; then choose a test most likely to distinguish them—a test that will probably give different results depending on which is true." An example of the need for the heuristic could be seen in a doctor's attempting to diagnose [[appendicitis]]. In that situation, assessing a [[white blood cell]] count would not assist in diagnosis because an elevated white blood cell count is associated with a number of maladies.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1985">In [[fluid dynamics]], the '''Cunningham correction factor''' or '''Cunningham slip correction factor''' is used to account for noncontinuum effects when calculating the drag on small particles. The derivation of [[Stokes Law]], which is used to calculate the drag force on small particles, assumes a [[No-slip condition]] which is no longer correct at high [[Knudsen number]]. The Cunningham slip correction factor allows predicting the [[drag force]] on a particle moving a fluid with [[Knudsen number]] between the continuum regime and [[free molecular flow]].

The [[drag coefficient]] calculated with standard correlations is divided by the Cunningham correction factor, C given below.

[[Ebenezer Cunningham]]&lt;ref name="Cunningham"&gt;Cunningham, E., "On the velocity of steady fall of spherical particles through fluid medium," ''Proc. Roy. Soc. A'' 83(1910)357. {{doi|10.1098/rspa.1910.0024}}&lt;/ref&gt; derived the correction factor in 1910 and with [[Robert Andrews Millikan]], verified the correction in the same year.

:&lt;math&gt;C = 1+ \frac{2\lambda}{d}\cdot (A_1+A_2\cdot e^{\frac{-A_3\cdot d}{\lambda}})&lt;/math&gt;

where
:''C'' is the correction factor
:λ is the [[mean free path]]
:''d'' is the particle diameter
:''A&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' are experimentally determined coefficients.
:For air (Davies, 1945):&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Davies|first1=C.|title=Definitive equations for the fluid resistance of spheres|journal=Proceedings of the Physical Society|date=1945|volume=57|page=259|doi=10.1088/0959-5309/57/4/301|bibcode=1945PPS....57..259D}}&lt;/ref&gt;
::''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 1.257
::''A''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.400
::''A''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.55

The Cunningham correction factor becomes significant when particles become smaller than 15 micrometers, for air at ambient conditions.

For sub-micrometer particles, [[Brownian motion]] must be taken into account.

'''Deep-level traps''' or '''deep-level defects''' are a generally undesirable type of electronic defect in [[semiconductor]]s. They are "deep" in the sense that the energy required to remove an electron or hole from the trap to the [[valence band|valence]] or [[conduction band]] is much larger than the characteristic thermal energy ''kT'', where ''k'' is the [[Boltzmann constant]] and ''T'' is temperature. Deep traps interfere with more useful types of [[Doping (semiconductor)|doping]] by ''compensating'' the dominant [[charge carrier]] type, annihilating either free electrons or [[electron hole]]s depending on which is more prevalent.  They also directly interfere with the operation of [[transistor]]s, [[light-emitting diode]]s and other electronic and opto-electronic devices, by offering an intermediate state inside the band gap. Deep-level traps shorten the [[non-radiative life time]] of charge carriers, and—through the [[Carrier generation and recombination|Shockley–Read–Hall (SRH) process]]—facilitate recombination of [[minority carrier]]s, having adverse effects on the semiconductor device performance.

Common [[chemical element]]s that produce deep-level defects in [[silicon]] include [[iron]], [[nickel]], [[copper]], [[gold]], and [[silver]].  In general, [[transition metal]]s produce this effect, while light metals such as [[aluminium]] do not.

[[Surface state]]s and [[crystallographic defect]]s in the crystal lattice can also play role of deep-level traps.

'''Emotional geography'''  is a subtopic within [[human geography]], dealing with the relationships between [[emotion]]s and [[Location (geography)|geographic place]]s and their contextual environments.

Emotional geography specifically focuses on how human emotions relate to, or affect, the [[Social environment|environment]] around them.&lt;ref name=HumGeo&gt;{{cite book |last=Gregory |first=Derek |title=The Dictionary of Human Geography |year=2011 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |isbn=1-4443-5995-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ernst Stuhlinger''' (December 19, 1913 [[Niederrimbach]], [[Germany]] – May 25, 2008) was a [[Germany|German]]-American atomic, electrical, and rocket scientist. After being brought to the United States as part of [[Operation Paperclip]], he developed guidance systems with [[Wernher von Braun]]'s team for the [[US Army]], and later was a scientist with [[NASA]]. He was also instrumental in the development of the [[ion engine]] for long-endurance space flight, and a wide variety of scientific experiments.&lt;ref name="nytimes1"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/28/us/28stuhlinger.html?_r=1| title= Ernst Stuhlinger, Rocket Scientist Crucial in Space Race, Is Dead at 94 | work=The New York Times| author=  John Noble Wilford| date= May 28, 2008 |accessdate=2010-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/obituaries/article4028377.ece| title=Ernst Stuhlinger| work=The Times| date=May 30, 2008|accessdate=2010-08-29 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.al.com/news/huntsvilletimes/index.ssf?/base/news/1211793338287890.xml&amp;coll=1 |title=Ernst Stuhlinger dies, was space age 'giant' |work=The Huntsville Times |date=2008-05-26 |accessdate=2010-08-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100221182634/http://www.al.com/news/huntsvilletimes/index.ssf?%2Fbase%2Fnews%2F1211793338287890.xml&amp;coll=1 |archivedate=2010-02-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life ==
Stuhlinger was born in [[Niederrimbach]] (now part of [[Creglingen]]), [[Württemberg]], [[Germany]]. At age 23, he earned his doctorate in physics at the [[University of Tübingen]] in 1936, working with [[Otto Haxel]], [[Hans Bethe]] and  his advisor [[Hans Geiger]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/S/Stuhlinger.html |title=Stuhlinger, Ernst (1913-2008) |publisher=Daviddarling.info |date=2007-02-01 |accessdate=2010-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/id.php?id=142435 Mathematical Genealogy Entry]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Stuhlinger | first1 = E. | title = Das Ionisierungsvermögen kosmischer Ultrastrahlen| doi = 10.1007/BF01321924 |bibcode=1938ZPhy..108..444S| journal = Zeitschrift für Physik| volume = 108 | issue = 7–8 | pages = 444–453 | year = 1938 | pmid =  | pmc = }} (This is the publication reprising his PhD thesis.)&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1939 to 1941, he worked in Berlin, on cosmic rays and nuclear physics as an assistant professor at the [[Berlin Institute of Technology]] developing innovative nuclear detector instrumentation.&lt;ref name="astronautix1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.astronautix.com/astros/stuinger.htm |title=Stuhlinger |publisher=Astronautix.com |accessdate=2010-08-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101019094908/http://astronautix.com/astros/stuinger.htm |archivedate=2010-10-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite showing promise as a scientist, in 1941 Stuhlinger was drafted as a private in the German Army and sent to the Russian front, where he was wounded during the [[Battle of Moscow]]. Following this, he was in the [[Battle of Stalingrad]] and was one of the few members of his unit to survive and make the long, on-foot retreat out of Russia in the cold of winter.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.al.com/breaking/2008/05/celestial_irony_between_mars_a.html |title=Celestial irony between Mars and Stuhlinger &amp;#124; al.com |publisher=Blog.al.com |date=2008-05-26 |accessdate=2010-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon reaching German territory in 1943, Stuhingler was ordered to the rocket development center in Peenemunde where he joined Dr. [[Wernher von Braun]]'s team. For the remainder of the war, he worked in the field of guidance systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nysun.com/obituaries/ernst-stuhlinger-94-rocket-designer/78717/ |title=Ernst Stuhlinger, 94, Rocket Designer - May 28, 2008 - The New York Sun |publisher=Nysun.com |date=2008-05-28 |accessdate=2010-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1954, Stuhlinger assisted in the founding of the Rocket City Astronomical Association (Renamed to the [[Von Braun Astronomical Society]] following von Braun's death) where he served as one of the five original directors for the observatory built inside [[Monte Sano State Park]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vbas.org/index.php/vbas-history/20-how-it-all-began|title=How It All Began|publisher=vbas.org|accessdate=2014-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Research Scientist ===
Stuhlinger was one of the first group of 126 scientists who emigrated to the United States with von Braun after World War II as part of [[Operation Paperclip]].&lt;ref name="moniquegerman"&gt;{{cite book |last=Laney |first=Monique |date=2015 |title=German Rocketeers in the Heart of Dixie: Making Sense of the Nazi Past During the Civil Rights Era  |location=New Haven and London |publisher=Yale University Press |pages=23–24 |isbn=978-0-300-19803-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1945–50 years, he primarily worked on guidance systems in US Army missile programs at [[Fort Bliss, Texas]]. In 1950, von Braun's team and the missile programs were transferred to [[Redstone Arsenal]] at [[Huntsville, Alabama]]. For the next decade, Stuhlinger and other von Braun team members worked on Army missiles, but they also devoted efforts in building an unofficial space capability. He eventually served as director of the Advanced Research Projects Division of the [[Army Ballistic Missile Agency]] (ABMA).&lt;ref name="astronautix1"/&gt; On April 14, 1955, together with many other Paperclip members, he became a naturalized United States citizen.&lt;ref name="nytimes1"/&gt; 
[[File:Von Braun and Stuhlinger discuss Disney special.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Von Braun and Stuhlinger discuss particulars of the [[nuclear electric rocket]] at [[Walt Disney Studios (Burbank)|Walt Disney Studios]].]]

In the 1950s, Stuhlinger, along with von Braun, collaborated with [[Walt Disney Pictures]].  Together, they produced three films, [[Man in Space]] and [[Man and the Moon]] in 1955, and [[Mars and Beyond]] in 1957.  Stuhlinger worked as a technical consultant for these films.&lt;ref name="Disney"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://history.msfc.nasa.gov/special/disney.html | title=The Disney-Von Braun Collaboration and Its Influence on Space Exploration | accessdate=March 25, 2011 | author=Wright, Mike | publisher=NASA MSFC | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050129090424/http://history.msfc.nasa.gov/special/disney.html | archivedate=2005-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stuhlinger played a small but important role in the race to launch a US satellite after the success of [[Sputnik 1]]. There was little time to develop and test automated guidance or staging systems, so Stuhlinger developed a simple spring-powered staging timer that was triggered from the ground. On the night of January 31, 1958, Stuhlinger was at the controls of the timer when the [[Explorer 1]] was launched, triggering the device right on time. He became known as "the man with the golden finger."  This satellite discovered the  [[Van Allen radiation belt]] through a cosmic ray sensor, a felicitous intersection with his early physics expertise, included in a science package supervised by Stuhlinger.

In 1960, the major part of ABMA was transferred to NASA, forming the [[Marshall Space Flight Center]] (MSFC) in [[Huntsville, Alabama]]. Stuhlinger served as director of the MSFC Space Science Laboratory from its formation in 1960 until 1968, and then was MSFC's associate director for science from 1968 to 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=James Wray and Ulf Stabe |url=http://www.thetechherald.com/article.php/200822/1082/Ernst-Stuhlinger-space-program-pioneer-dies-aged-94 |title=Ernst Stuhlinger, space program pioneer, dies aged 94 - Science |publisher=Thetechherald.com |date=2008-05-26 |accessdate=2010-08-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717035955/http://www.thetechherald.com/article.php/200822/1082/Ernst-Stuhlinger-space-program-pioneer-dies-aged-94 |archivedate=2011-07-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Among his many other works at Marshall, he directed early planning for lunar exploration, worked on the [[Apollo Telescope Mount]] that produced a wealth of information about the Sun, led planning for the three [[High Energy Astronomical Observatory|High Energy Astronomical Observatorie]]s, and worked on the initial phases of what would become the [[Hubble Space Telescope]].

In 1970, shortly after the first lunar landing, Stuhlinger received a letter from Sister Mary Jucunda in [[Zambia]], Africa, asking how billions of dollars could be spent for space research when so many children on the Earth were starving to death. Stuhlinger's thoughtful response is often cited to justify such expenditures.&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Stuhlinger, [http://www.meaus.com/whyExplore.html    "Why Explore Space?"]. Retrieved 2012-02-08&lt;/ref&gt;

Stuhlinger spent much of his spare time developing designs for solar-powered spacecraft. The most popular of those designs relied on [[ion thrusters]], which ionize either [[caesium]] or [[rubidium]] vapor and accelerate the positively charged ions through gridded electrodes.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; The spacecraft would be powered by one kilowatt of solar energy. He referred to the concept as a "sunship". He is considered as one of the pioneers of [[Electrically powered spacecraft propulsion|electric propulsion]] having, among many contributions, authored the classic textbook ''Ion Propulsion for Space Flight'' (McGraw-Hill, New York, 1964). In 2005, he was honored by the Electric Rocket Propulsion Society, and awarded its highest honor "The Medal for Outstanding Achievement in Electric Propulsion", which was renamed the [[Stuhlinger Medal]] shortly following his death.

After retiring from NASA in January 1976, Stuhlinger became an adjunct professor and senior research scientist at the [[University of Alabama in Huntsville]] (UAH), holding this position for the next 20 years. In 1978, he was at the [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich|University of Munich]] for six months on a [[Alexander von Humboldt Foundation|Humboldt Fellowship]]. Ernst was especially proud of winning this award as an American scientist.  During 1984-89, he was also a senior research associate with [[Teledyne Brown Engineering]].

=== Historian ===
Starting in 1990, Stuhlinger and [[Frederick I. Ordway III]] collaborated on the two-volume biography ''Werhner von Braun: Crusader for Space'' (Krieger Publishing, 1994). In it, Stuhlinger downplayed claims that von Braun had mistreated prisoners working on the [[V-2]] program during the war. Michael J. Neufeld has questioned this version, maintaining that knowledge of V-2 production using [[forced labor]] is an established fact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/?id=07hgJbzQrt0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Von+Braun:+Dreamer+of+Space,+Engineer+of+War#v=onepage&amp;q=stuhlinger&amp;f=false| title= Von Braun: Dreamer of Space, Engineer of War| author=Michael J. Neufeld| publisher=Random House, Inc.| year= 2008| isbn= 978-0-307-38937-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Stuhlinger reiterated the point that their aim was ultimately peaceful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/ernst-stuhlinger-rocket-scientist-who-helped-the-us-become-the-leading-space-power-844178.html |title=Ernst Stuhlinger: Rocket scientist who helped the US become the leading space power - Obituaries, News |publisher=The Independent |date= 2008-06-11|accessdate=2010-08-29 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a newspaper article he wrote:[[File:Saturn V Dedication 9904850.jpg|thumb|Saturn V dedication]]
&lt;blockquote&gt;Yes, we did work on improved guidance systems, but in late 1944 we were convinced that the war would soon be over before new systems could be used on military rockets. However, we were convinced that somehow our work would find application in the future rockets that would not aim at London, but at the moon.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.al.com/news/huntsvilletimes/index.ssf?/base/news/1211793348287890.xml&amp;coll=1 "Von Braun no hero, but was a rocket genius," ''The Huntsville Times'', 14 Oct. 1995;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080531102713/http://www.al.com/news/huntsvilletimes/index.ssf?%2Fbase%2Fnews%2F1211793348287890.xml&amp;coll=1 |date=2008-05-31 }}.

Stuhlinger was interviewed in 1984 by fellow Operation Paperclip scientist [[Konrad Dannenberg]] and UAH professor Donald Tarter for an oral history series. This hour-long review of their experiences has information on early space programs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://media.uah.edu/nasa/new_nasa_archives/videos/tarter4.wmv. "A Future in Space: Messages from the Beginning" (opens in Microsoft Media Player)] Retrieved 2012-02-08&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, when he was 90, Stuhlinger helped to raise funds to preserve a Saturn V rocket display at Huntsville, Alabama.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Maney |first=Kevin |url=https://www.usatoday.com/money/industries/technology/2004-12-07-rocketeers_x.htm |title=Last rocketeers set sights on Mars |publisher=Usatoday.Com |date=2004-12-09 |accessdate=2010-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Ernst Stuhlinger died in Huntsville at age 94.

'''Explorer 28''' (or '''IMP-C''') was a satellite launched in May 1965 to study [[Space physics]]. It was powered by chemical batteries and [[Solar panels]]. There were 7 experiments onboard, all devoted to particle studies. Performance was normal until mid-April 1967, when intermittent problems began. It stayed in contact until May 12, 1967, when contact was lost. The orbit kept going lower and lower until it re-entered on July 4 1968.&lt;ref&gt;https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraftDisplay.do?id=1965-042A&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Graphene quantum dots''' ('''GQDs''') represent single-layer to tens of layers of [[graphene]] of a size less than 30 [[nanometer|nm]]. Due to its exceptional properties such as low toxicity, stable [[photoluminescence]], chemical stability and pronounced [[Potential well|quantum confinement]] effect, GQDs are considered as a novel material for biological, opto-electronics, energy and environmental applications.

==Properties==
The graphene quantum dot (GQD) is becoming an advanced multifunctional material for its unique [[optics|optical]], [[electronics|electronic]],&lt;ref name=pmid19219032&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/nmat2378 |pmid=19219032 |title=The influence of edge structure on the electronic properties of graphene quantum dots and nanoribbons |journal=Nature Materials |volume=8 |issue=3 |pages=235–42 |year=2009 |last1=Ritter |first1=Kyle A |last2=Lyding |first2=Joseph W |bibcode=2009NatMa...8..235R }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Spin (physics)|spin]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1103/PhysRevB.84.035425 |title=Electric-field controlled spin in bilayer triangular graphene quantum dots |journal=Physical Review B |volume=84 |issue=3 |year=2011 |last1=Güçlü |first1=A. D |last2=Potasz |first2=P |last3=Hawrylak |first3=P |arxiv=1104.3108 |bibcode=2011PhRvB..84c5425G }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[photoelectricity|photoelectric]] properties induced by the quantum confinement effect and edge effect. GQDs are fragments limited in size, or domains, of a single-layer two-dimensional graphene crystal. Spectral studies have found that in almost all cases, GQDs are not single-layer graphene domains, but multi-layer formations containing up to 10 layers of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) from 10 to 60&amp;nbsp;nm in size.

Presently, several techniques have been developed to prepare GQDs; these techniques mainly include [[electron beam lithography]], [[chemical synthesis]], electrochemical preparation, [[graphene oxide]] (GO) reduction, [[Buckminsterfullerene|C60]] [[catalyst|catalytic]] transformation, the [[microwave radiation|microwave]] assisted hydrothermal method (MAH),&lt;ref name=pmid22559247&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1021/nn300760g |pmid=22559247 |title=Deep Ultraviolet Photoluminescence of Water-Soluble Self-Passivated Graphene Quantum Dots |journal=ACS Nano |volume=6 |issue=6 |pages=5102–10 |year=2012 |last1=Tang |first1=Libin |last2=Ji |first2=Rongbin |last3=Cao |first3=Xiangke |last4=Lin |first4=Jingyu |last5=Jiang |first5=Hongxing |last6=Li |first6=Xueming |last7=Teng |first7=Kar Seng |last8=Luk |first8=Chi Man |last9=Zeng |first9=Songjun |last10=Hao |first10=Jianhua |last11=Lau |first11=Shu Ping }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid24848545&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1021/nn501796r |pmid=24848545 |title=Deep Ultraviolet to Near-Infrared Emission and Photoresponse in Layered N-Doped Graphene Quantum Dots |journal=ACS Nano |volume=8 |issue=6 |pages=6312–20 |year=2014 |last1=Tang |first1=Libin |last2=Ji |first2=Rongbin |last3=Li |first3=Xueming |last4=Bai |first4=Gongxun |last5=Liu |first5=Chao Ping |last6=Hao |first6=Jianhua |last7=Lin |first7=Jingyu |last8=Jiang |first8=Hongxing |last9=Teng |first9=Kar Seng |last10=Yang |first10=Zhibin |last11=Lau |first11=Shu Ping }}&lt;/ref&gt; the Soft-Template method,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/ppsc.201200131 |title=Size-Dependent Structural and Optical Characteristics of Glucose-Derived Graphene Quantum Dots |journal=Particle &amp; Particle Systems Characterization |volume=30 |issue=6 |pages=523–31 |year=2013 |last1=Tang |first1=Libin |last2=Ji |first2=Rongbin |last3=Li |first3=Xueming |last4=Teng |first4=Kar Seng |last5=Lau |first5=Shu Ping }}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Hydrothermal synthesis|hydrothermal method]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1039/C3TC31473A |title=Multicolour light emission from chlorine-doped graphene quantum dots |journal=Journal of Materials Chemistry C |volume=1 |issue=44 |pages=7308–13 |year=2013 |last1=Li |first1=Xueming |last2=Lau |first2=Shu Ping |last3=Tang |first3=Libin |last4=Ji |first4=Rongbin |last5=Yang |first5=Peizhi }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid23579482&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1039/C3NR33849E |pmid=23579482 |title=Focusing on luminescent graphene quantum dots: Current status and future perspectives |journal=Nanoscale |volume=5 |issue=10 |pages=4015–39 |year=2013 |last1=Li |first1=Lingling |last2=Wu |first2=Gehui |last3=Yang |first3=Guohai |last4=Peng |first4=Juan |last5=Zhao |first5=Jianwei |last6=Zhu |first6=Jun-Jie |bibcode=2013Nanos...5.4015L }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid24699893&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1039/C4NR00693C |pmid=24699893 |title=Sulphur doping: A facile approach to tune the electronic structure and optical properties of graphene quantum dots |journal=Nanoscale |volume=6 |issue=10 |pages=5323–8 |year=2014 |last1=Li |first1=Xueming |last2=Lau |first2=Shu Ping |last3=Tang |first3=Libin |last4=Ji |first4=Rongbin |last5=Yang |first5=Peizhi |bibcode=2014Nanos...6.5323L }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ultrasonic exfoliation method.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1063/1.4896278 |bibcode=2014ApPhL.105k1116Z |title=Chlorine doped graphene quantum dots: Preparation, properties, and photovoltaic detectors |journal=Applied Physics Letters |volume=105 |issue=11 |pages=111116 |year=2014 |last1=Zhao |first1=Jianhong |last2=Tang |first2=Libin |last3=Xiang |first3=Jinzhong |last4=Ji |first4=Rongbin |last5=Yuan |first5=Jun |last6=Zhao |first6=Jun |last7=Yu |first7=Ruiyun |last8=Tai |first8=Yunjian |last9=Song |first9=Liyuan }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Hale telescope''' is a {{convert|200|in|m|sing=on}}, [[F-number|{{f/}}3.3]] [[reflecting telescope]] at the [[Palomar Observatory]] in [[California]], US, named after astronomer [[George Ellery Hale]]. With funding from the [[Rockefeller Foundation]] in 1928, he orchestrated the planning, design, and construction of the observatory, but with the project ending up taking 20 years he did not live to see its commissioning. The Hale was groundbreaking for its time, with double the diameter of the next largest [[telescope]], and pioneered many new technologies in [[telescope mount]] design and in the design and fabrication of its large aluminum coated "honeycomb" low [[thermal expansion]] [[Pyrex]] mirror.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.astro.caltech.edu/palomar/about/telescopes/hale.html&lt;/ref&gt;. It was completed in 1948 and is still in active use.

The Hale Telescope represented the technological limit in building large optical telescopes for over 30 years. It was the [[List of largest optical reflecting telescopes|largest telescope in the world]] until the Russian [[BTA-6]] was built in 1976, and the second largest until the construction of the [[Keck Observatory]] Keck 1 in 1993.

== History ==

Hale supervised the building of the telescopes at the [[Mount Wilson Observatory]] with grants from the [[Carnegie Institution of Washington]]: the {{convert|60|in|m|adj=on}} telescope in 1908 and the {{convert|100|in|m|adj=on}} telescope in 1917. These telescopes were very successful, leading to the rapid advance in understanding of the scale of the [[Universe]] through the 1920s, and demonstrating to visionaries like Hale the need for even larger collectors.

The chief optical designer for Hale's previous 100-inch telescope was [[George Willis Ritchey]], who intended the new telescope to be of [[Ritchey–Chrétien telescope|Ritchey–Chrétien]] design. Compared to the usual parabolic primary, this design would have provided sharper images over a larger usable field of view. However, Ritchey and Hale had a falling-out. With the project already late and over budget, Hale refused to adopt the new design, with its complex curvatures, and Ritchey left the project. The Mount Palomar Hale telescope turned out to be the last world-leading telescope to have a parabolic [[primary mirror]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

In 1928 Hale secured a grant of $6 million from the [[Rockefeller Foundation]] for "the construction of an observatory, including a 200-inch reflecting telescope" to be administered by the [[California Institute of Technology]] (Caltech), of which Hale was a founding member. In the early 1930s, Hale selected a site at {{convert|1700|m|ft|abbr=on}} on [[Palomar Mountain]] in [[San Diego County, California]], US, as the best site, and less likely to be affected by the growing light pollution problem in urban centers like [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]]. The [[Corning Glass Works]] was assigned the task of making a {{convert|200|in|m|adj=on}} primary mirror. Construction of the observatory facilities and dome started in 1936, but because of interruptions caused by [[World War II]], the telescope was not completed until 1948 when it was dedicated.&lt;ref name="NYTimes1948b"&gt;{{cite news

The telescope continues to be used every clear night for scientific research by astronomers from Caltech and their operating partners, [[Cornell University]], the [[University of California]], and the [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]]. It is equipped with modern optical and infrared array imagers, spectrographs, and an [[adaptive optics]]&lt;ref name="Fienberg" /&gt; system. It has also used [[lucky cam]] imaging, which in combination with adaptive optics pushed the mirror close to its [[Diffraction-limited system|theoretical resolution]] for certain types of viewing.&lt;ref name="Fienberg"&gt;{{cite web

== Components ==

=== Mounting structures ===

The Hale telescope uses a special type of [[equatorial mount]] called a "horseshoe mount", a modified yoke mount that replaces the polar bearing with an open "horseshoe" structure that gives the telescope full access to the entire sky, including [[Polaris]] and stars near it. The optical tube assembly (OTA) uses a [[Serrurier truss]], then newly invented by [[Mark Serrurier|Mark U. Serrurier]] of Caltech in Pasadena in 1935, designed to flex in such a way as to keep all of the optics in alignment.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia of Astronomy and Physics'', "Reflecting Telescopes", Paul Murdin and Patrick Moore&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Theodore von Karman]] designed the lubrication system to avoid potential issues with turbulence during tracking.

Originally, the Hale telescope was going to use a primary mirror of fused quartz manufactured by General Electric,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=4OIDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=-PA97&amp;dq=Popular+Science+1930+plane+%22Popular+Mechanics%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=NCt4TtDKIqnf0QG65_3-Cw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=book-thumbnail&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CEIQ6wEwBTge#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true "Frozen Eye to Bring New Worlds into View" ''Popular Mechanics'', June 1931]&lt;/ref&gt; but instead the primary mirror was cast in 1934 at [[Corning Glass Works]] in New York State using Corning's then new material called [[Pyrex]] ([[borosilicate glass]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=200-inch Hale Telescope, Palomar Observatory|url=http://www.space.com/businesstechnology/technology/top5_telescopes_021023-2.html|work=The Top 5 Telescopes of All Time|publisher=[[Space.com]]|accessdate=20 December 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090819025158/http://www.space.com/businesstechnology/technology/top5_telescopes_021023-2.html|archivedate=19 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pyrex was chosen for its low expansion qualities so the large mirror would not distort the images produced when it changed shape due to temperature variations (a problem that plagued earlier large telescopes).

[[File:Hartmann Screen.jpg|thumb|275px|The [[Hartmann mask]] used for the 200" mirror.]]

The mirror was cast in a mold with 36 raised mold blocks (similar in shape to a [[waffle iron]]). This created a [[honeycomb mirror]] that cut the amount of Pyrex needed down from over {{convert|40|ST|MT|abbr=on}} to just {{convert|20|ST|MT|abbr=on}}, making a mirror that would cool faster in use and have multiple "mounting points" on the back to evenly distribute its weight (note – see external links 1934 article for drawings).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|bibcode=1941Obs....64..129S |author=Spencer Jones, H. |journal=The Observatory |volume=64 |pages=129–135 |date=1941 |title=The 200-inch telescope}}&lt;/ref&gt; The shape of a central hole was also part of the mold so light could pass through the finished mirror when it was used in a [[Cassegrain reflector|Cassegrain]] configuration (a Pyrex plug for this hole was also made to be used during the grinding and polishing process&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu//full/1948PASP...60..221A/0000222.000.html Anderson, J.

While the glass was being poured into the mold during the first attempt to cast the 200-inch mirror, the intense heat caused several of the molding blocks to break loose and float to the top, ruining the mirror. The defective mirror was used to test the annealing process. After the mold was re-engineered, a second mirror was successfully cast.

After cooling several months, the finished mirror blank was transported by rail to Pasadena, California.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cmog.org/dynamic.aspx?id=5720 The Hale Reflecting Telescope] Corning Museum of Glass&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.astro.caltech.edu/observatories/palomar/history/ Caltech Astronomy : History: 1908–1949] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511172200/http://www.astro.caltech.edu/observatories/palomar/history/ |date=2008-05-11 }}.

The ''Cornell Mid-Infrared Asteroid Spectroscopy'' (MIDAS) survey used the Hale telescope with a spectrograpgh to study spectra from  29 asteroids.&lt;ref name="mit.edu"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.icarus.2004.08.005 |url=http://www.mit.edu/people/lucylim/2005_Icarus_LimMcConnochie_Thermal_infrared_8-13_micron_spectra.pdf|title=Thermal infrared (8?13 ?m) spectra of 29 asteroids: The Cornell Mid-Infrared Asteroid Spectroscopy (MIDAS) Survey|journal=Icarus|volume=173|issue=2|pages=385|year=2005|last1=Lim|first1=L|last2=McConnochie|first2=T|last3=Belliii|first3=J|last4=Hayward|first4=T|bibcode=2005Icar..173..385L}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Direct imaging of exoplanets ===

Up until the year 2010, [[telescope#Research telescopes|telescopes]] could only [[Direct imaging|directly image]] exoplanets under exceptional circumstances. Specifically, it is easier to obtain images when the planet is especially large (considerably larger than [[Jupiter]]), widely separated from its parent star, and hot so that it emits intense infrared radiation. However, in 2010 a team from [[NASA]]'s [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] demonstrated that a [[vortex coronagraph]] could enable small scopes to directly image planets.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, Andrea. (2010-04-14) [http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/36528711/ns/technology_and_science-space/ New method could image Earth-like planets]. MSNBC. Retrieved on 2011-07-01.&lt;/ref&gt; They did this by imaging the previously imaged [[HR 8799]] planets using just a 1.5 m portion of the Hale telescope.

The Hale had four times the light-collecting area of the next largest scope when it was commissioned in 1949. Other contemporary telescopes were the [[Hooker Telescope]] at the Mount Wilson Observatory and the [[Otto Struve Telescope]] at the McDonald Observatory.

'''Health Systems Engineering''' or '''Health Engineering''' (often known as "Health Care Systems Engineering (HCSE)") is an academic and a pragmatic discipline that approaches the [[health care]] industry, and other industries connected with health care delivery, as [[complex adaptive system]]s, and identifies and applies engineering design and analysis principles in such areas. This can overlap with [[biomedical engineering]] which focuses on design and development of various medical products; [[industrial engineering]] and [[operations management]] which involve improving organizational operations; and various health care practice fields like [[medicine]], [[pharmacy]], [[dentistry]], [[nursing]], etc.  Other fields participating in this interdisciplinary area include [[public health]], [[information technology]], [[management]] studies, and regulatory [[law]].

People whose work implicates this field in some capacity can include members of all the above-noted fields, many of which have sub-fields targeted toward health care matters even if health or health care is not a principal focus of the overall field (e.g. management, law). Areas of [[biomedical engineering]] (BME) in this area often include [[clinical engineering]] (sometimes also called "hospital engineering") as well as those BMEs developing [[medical devices]] and [[pharmaceutical drug]]s.  The [[industrial engineering]] (IE) principles employed tend to include optimization, decision analysis, [[human factors engineering]], quality engineering, and value engineering.

[[Image:HubbleTuningFork.jpg|thumb|350px|Tuning-fork style diagram of the Hubble sequence]]

Hubble’s scheme divides regular galaxies into three broad classes – [[elliptical galaxy|ellipticals]], [[lenticular galaxy|lenticulars]] and [[spiral galaxy|spirals]] – based on their visual appearance (originally on [[photographic plate]]s). A fourth class contains galaxies with an [[irregular galaxy|irregular]] appearance. To this day, the Hubble sequence is the most commonly used system for classifying galaxies, both in professional astronomical research and in [[amateur astronomy]].

==Classes of galaxies==

===Ellipticals===

[[Image:Abell S740, cropped to ESO 325-G004.jpg|thumb|The giant elliptical galaxy ESO 325-G004.]]
On the left (in the sense that the sequence is usually drawn) lie the [[elliptical galaxy|ellipticals]]. Elliptical galaxies have relatively smooth, featureless light distributions and appear as ellipses in photographic images. They are denoted by the letter E, followed by an integer ''n'' representing their degree of [[Flattening|ellipticity]] in the sky. By convention, ''n'' is ten times the ellipticity of the galaxy, rounded to the nearest integer, where the ellipticity is defined as {{nowrap|''e'' {{=}} 1 − {{sfrac|''b''|''a''}}}} for an ellipse with semi-major and semi-minor axes of lengths ''a'' and ''b'' respectively.&lt;ref name="binney_merrifield"&gt;{{cite book |last=Binney |first=J. |authorlink=James Binney |author2=Merrifield, M. |title=Galactic Astronomy |date=1998 |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=Princeton |isbn=978-0-691-02565-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ellipticity increases from left to right on the Hubble diagram, with near-circular (E0) galaxies situated on the very left of the diagram. It is important to note that the ellipticity of a galaxy on the sky is only indirectly related to the true 3-dimensional shape (for example, a flattened, discus-shaped galaxy can appear almost round if viewed face-on or highly elliptical if viewed edge-on). Observationally, the most flattened "elliptical" galaxies have ellipticities ''e'' = 0.7 (denoted E7).  However, from studying the light profiles and the ellipticity profiles, rather than just looking at the images, it was realised in the 1960s that the E5–E7 galaxies are probably misclassified lenticular galaxies with large-scale disks seen at various inclinations to our line-of-sight.&lt;ref&gt;Martha Liller (1966), [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1966ApJ...146...28L The Distribution of Intensity in Elliptical Galaxies of the Virgo Cluster.

===Lenticulars===
[[Image:Ngc5866 hst big rotated.jpg|thumb|The [[NGC 5866|Spindle Galaxy]] (NGC 5866), a lenticular galaxy with a prominent [[dust lane]] in the [[Draco (constellation)|constellation of Draco]].]]
At the centre of the Hubble tuning fork, where the two spiral-galaxy branches and the elliptical branch join, lies an intermediate class of galaxies known as [[lenticular galaxy|lenticulars]] and given the symbol S0. These galaxies consist of a bright central [[bulge (astronomy)|bulge]], similar in appearance to an [[elliptical galaxy]], surrounded by an extended, [[galaxy disk|disk]]-like structure. Unlike [[spiral galaxy|spiral galaxies]], the disks of lenticular galaxies have no visible spiral structure and are not actively forming stars in any significant quantity. 

When simply looking at a galaxy's image, lenticular galaxies with relatively face-on disks are difficult to distinguish from ellipticals of type E0–E3, making the classification of many such galaxies uncertain. When viewed edge-on, the disk becomes more apparent and prominent dust-lanes are sometimes visible in [[absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]] at optical wavelengths.

At the time of the initial publication of Hubble's galaxy classification scheme, the existence of lenticular galaxies was purely hypothetical. Hubble believed that they were necessary as an intermediate stage between the highly flattened "ellipticals" and spirals. Later [[observational astronomy|observations]] (by Hubble himself, among others) showed Hubble's belief to be correct and the S0 class was included in the definitive exposition of the Hubble sequence by [[Allan Sandage]].&lt;ref name="sandage"&gt;{{cite conference |first = A. |last = Sandage |authorlink = Allan Sandage |date = 1975 |title = Classification and Stellar Content of Galaxies Obtained from Direct Photography |booktitle = Galaxies and the Universe |editor = A. Sandage |others = M. Sandage and J. Kristian |url = http://nedwww.ipac.caltech.edu/level5/Sandage/frames.html |accessdate = 2007-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Missing from the Hubble sequence are the early-type galaxies with intermediate-scale disks, in between the E and S0 type, Martha Liller denoted them '''ES''' galaxies in 1966.

Lenticular and spiral galaxies, taken together, are often referred to as [[disk galaxy|disk galaxies]].  The bulge-to-disk flux ratio in lenticular galaxies can take on a range of values, just as it does for each of the spiral galaxy morphological types (Sa, Sb, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Graham |first=A. |author2=Worley, C. |date=August 2008 |title=Inclination- and dust-corrected galaxy parameters: bulge-to-disc ratios and size-luminosity relations |journal=[[Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society]] |volume=388 |issue=4 |pages=1708–1728 |bibcode=2008MNRAS.388.1708G |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2966.2008.13506.x|arxiv = 0805.3565 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spirals===
[[Image:M101 hires STScI-PRC2006-10a.jpg|thumb|The [[Pinwheel Galaxy]] (Messier 101/NGC 5457): a spiral galaxy classified as type Scd on the Hubble sequence]]
[[Image:Hubble2005-01-barred-spiral-galaxy-NGC1300.jpg|thumb|right|The barred spiral galaxy [[NGC 1300]]: a type SBbc]]
On the right of the Hubble sequence diagram are two parallel branches encompassing the [[spiral galaxy|spiral galaxies]]. A spiral galaxy consists of a flattened [[galaxy disk|disk]], with [[star]]s forming a (usually two-armed) [[spiral]] structure, and a central concentration of stars known as the [[bulge (astronomy)|bulge]]. Roughly half of all spirals are also observed to have a bar-like structure, extending from the central bulge, at the ends of which the spiral arms begin. In the tuning-fork diagram, the regular spirals occupy the upper branch and are denoted by the letter S, while the lower branch contains the barred spirals, given the symbol SB. Both type of spirals are further subdivided according to the detailed appearance of their spiral structures. Membership of one of these subdivisions is indicated by adding a lower-case letter to the morphological type, as follows:
* Sa (SBa) – tightly wound, smooth arms; large, bright central bulge
* Sb (SBb) – less tightly wound spiral arms than Sa (SBa); somewhat fainter bulge
* Sc (SBc) – loosely wound spiral arms, clearly resolved into individual stellar clusters and nebulae; smaller, fainter bulge

Hubble originally described three classes of spiral galaxy. This was extended by [[Gérard de Vaucouleurs]]&lt;ref name="devaucouleurs"&gt;{{cite journal |last=de Vaucouleurs |first=G. |authorlink=Gérard de Vaucouleurs |date=1959 |title=Classification and Morphology of External Galaxies |journal=Handbuch der Physik |volume=53 |pages=275 |bibcode=1959HDP....53..275D |last2=Oemler |first2=Augustus, Jr. |last3=Butcher |first3=Harvey R. |last4=Gunn |first4=James E.}}&lt;/ref&gt; to include a fourth class:
* Sd (SBd) – very loosely wound, fragmentary arms; most of the luminosity is in the arms and not the bulge

Although strictly part of the [[Galaxy morphological classification#De Vaucouleurs system|de Vaucouleurs system]] of classification, the Sd class is often included in the Hubble sequence. The basic spiral types can be extended to enable finer distinctions of appearance. For example, spiral galaxies whose appearance is intermediate between two of the above classes are often identified by appending two lower-case letters to the main galaxy type (for example, Sbc for a galaxy that is intermediate between an Sb and an Sc).

Our own [[Milky Way]] is generally classed as SBb or SBc&lt;ref&gt;Paul Hodge (1983), [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1983PASP...95..721H The Hubble type of the Milky Way Galaxy]&lt;/ref&gt;, making it a barred spiral with well-defined arms. 

Examples of regular spiral galaxies: [[Andromeda Galaxy|M31]] (Andromeda Galaxy), [[Messier 74|M74]], [[Messier 81|M81]], [[Sombrero Galaxy|M104]] (Sombrero Galaxy), [[Whirlpool Galaxy|M51a]] (Whirlpool Galaxy), [[NGC 300]], [[NGC 772]].

Examples of barred spiral galaxies: [[Messier 91|M91]], [[Messier 95|M95]], [[NGC 1097]], [[NGC 1300]], [[NGC1672]], [[NGC 2536]], [[NGC 2903]].

===Irregulars===
[[Image:large.mc.arp.750pix.jpg|thumb|The [[Large Magellanic Cloud]] (LMC) - a dwarf [[irregular galaxy]]]]
Galaxies that do not fit into the Hubble sequence, because they have no regular structure (either disk-like or ellipsoidal), are termed [[irregular galaxy|irregular galaxies]]. Hubble defined two classes of irregular galaxy:&lt;ref name="longair"&gt;{{cite book |last=Longair |first=M. S. |authorlink=Malcolm Longair |title=Galaxy Formation |date=1998 |publisher=Springer |location=New York |isbn=3-540-63785-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Irr I galaxies have asymmetric profiles and lack a central bulge or obvious spiral structure; instead they contain many individual clusters of young stars
* Irr II galaxies have smoother, asymmetric appearances and are not clearly resolved into individual stars or stellar clusters
In his extension to the Hubble sequence, de Vaucouleurs called the Irr I galaxies 'Magellanic irregulars', after the [[Magellanic Clouds]] – two satellites of the Milky Way which Hubble classified as Irr I. The discovery of a faint spiral structure&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=de Vaucouleurs |first=G. |authorlink=Gérard de Vaucouleurs |date=1955 |title=Studies of Magellanic Clouds. I. Dimensions and structure of the Large Cloud |journal=The Astronomical Journal |volume=160 |pages=126–140 |bibcode=1955AJ.....60..126D |doi=10.1086/107173 |last2=Oemler |first2=Augustus, Jr. |last3=Butcher |first3=Harvey R. |last4=Gunn |first4=James E.}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Large Magellanic Cloud]] led de Vaucouleurs to further divide the irregular galaxies into those that, like the LMC, show some evidence for spiral structure (these are given the symbol Sm) and those that have no obvious structure, such as the [[Small Magellanic Cloud]] (denoted Im). In the extended Hubble sequence, the Magellanic irregulars are usually placed at the end of the spiral branch of the Hubble tuning fork.

Examples of irregular galaxies: [[Messier 82|M82]], [[NGC 1427A]], [[Large Magellanic Cloud]], [[Small Magellanic Cloud]].

==Physical significance==

Elliptical and lenticular galaxies are commonly referred to together as “early-type” galaxies, while spirals and irregular galaxies are referred to as “late types”. This nomenclature is the source of the common,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Baldry |first=I. K. |date=2008 |title=Hubble's Galaxy Nomenclature |journal=Astronomy &amp; Geophysics |volume=49 |issue=5 |pages=5.25 |doi=10.1111/j.1468-4004.2008.49525.x |bibcode=2008A&amp;G....49e..25B|arxiv = 0809.0125 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but erroneous, belief that the Hubble sequence was intended to reflect a supposed [[evolution (term)|evolutionary]] sequence, from [[elliptical galaxy|elliptical galaxies]] through [[lenticular galaxy|lenticulars]] to either [[barred spiral galaxy|barred]] or [[spiral galaxy|regular spirals]]. In fact, Hubble was clear from the beginning that no such interpretation was implied:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The nomenclature, it is emphasized, refers to position in the sequence, and temporal connotations are made at one's peril. The entire classification is purely empirical and without prejudice to theories of evolution...&lt;ref name="hubble27"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hubble |first=E. P. |authorlink=Edwin Hubble |date=1927 |title=The Classification of Spiral Nebulae |journal=The Observatory |volume=50 |pages=276 |bibcode=1927Obs....50..276H}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The evolutionary picture appears to be lent weight by the fact that the disks of spiral galaxies are observed to be home to many young [[star]]s and regions of active [[star formation]], while elliptical galaxies are composed of predominantly old stellar populations. In fact, current evidence suggests the opposite: the early Universe appears to be dominated by spiral and irregular galaxies. In the currently favored picture of [[galaxy formation]], present-day ellipticals formed as a result of mergers between these earlier building blocks; while some lenticular galaxies may have formed this way, others may have accreted their disks around pre-existing spheroids.&lt;ref&gt;Graham, Alister W.; Dullo, Bililign T.; Savorgnan, Giulia A.

==Shortcomings==

A common criticism of the Hubble scheme is that the criteria for assigning galaxies to classes are subjective, leading to different observers assigning galaxies to different classes (although experienced observers usually agree to within less than a single Hubble type).&lt;ref name=dressler_et_al&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dressler|first=A. |last2=Oemler, Jr.|first2=A. |last3=Butcher|first3=H.

(1995), [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1995Sci...267..859L Galaxies, Human Eyes, and Artificial Neural Networks]&lt;/ref&gt;  Although not really a short-coming, since the 1961 Hubble Atlas of Galaxies, the primary criteria used to assign the morphological type (a, b, c, etc.) has been the nature of the spiral arms, rather than the bulge-to-disk flux ratio, and thus a range of flux ratios exist for each morphological type&lt;ref&gt;Allan Sandage (1961), [The Hubble Atlas of Galaxies]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vorontsov-Vel'Yaminov, B. A.; Arkhipova, V. P. (1962), [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1962MCG...C01....0V Morphological catalogue of galaxies. Part 1.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vorontsov-Vel'Yaminov, B. A.; Noskova, R. I. (1973) [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1973SvA....16..824V Photometric Parameters of Flat Galaxies.]&lt;/ref&gt;, as with the lenticular galaxies.

Another criticism of the Hubble classification scheme is that, being based on the appearance of a galaxy in a two-dimensional image, the classes are only indirectly related to the true physical properties of galaxies. In particular, problems arise because of [[orientation (geometry)|orientation]] effects. The same galaxy would look very different, if viewed edge-on, as opposed to a face-on or ‘broadside’ viewpoint.  As such, the early-type sequence is poorly represented: the ES galaxies are missing from the Hubble sequence, and the E5–E7 galaxies are actually S0 galaxies.  Furthermore, the barred ES and barred S0 galaxies are also absent.

Visual classifications are also less reliable for faint or distant galaxies, and the appearance of galaxies can change depending on the [[wavelength]] of light in which they are observed.

Nonetheless, the Hubble sequence is still commonly used in the field of [[extragalactic astronomy]] and Hubble types are known to correlate with many physically relevant properties of galaxies, such as [[Luminosity|luminosities]], colours, masses (of stars and gas) and star formation rates.&lt;ref name=roberts_haynes&gt;{{cite journal |last=Roberts |first=M.

'''Hugh Bamford Cott''' (6 July 1900 – 18 April 1987) was a British [[zoologist]], an authority on both natural and military [[camouflage]], and a scientific illustrator and [[photographer]]. Many of his field studies took place in [[Africa]], where he was especially interested in the [[Nile crocodile]], the evolution of pattern and colour in animals. During the [[World War II|Second World War]], Cott worked as a camouflage expert for the British Army and helped to influence War Office policy on camouflage. His book ''[[Adaptive Coloration in Animals]]'' (1940), popular among serving soldiers, was the major textbook on camouflage in zoology of the twentieth century. After the war, he became a Fellow of [[Selwyn College, Cambridge]]. As a Fellow of the Zoological Society of London, he undertook expeditions to Africa and the Amazon to collect specimens, mainly reptiles and amphibians.

==Life and career==

Cott was born in [[Ashby Magna]], [[Leicestershire]], [[England]], on 6 July 1900; his father was the [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|rector]] there.&lt;ref&gt;Forsyth, 2012. Page 67.&lt;/ref&gt; He was schooled at [[Rugby School|Rugby]]. In 1919, he graduated from the [[Royal Military College, Sandhurst]], and was commissioned into the [[Leicestershire Regiment]]. Between 1922 and 1925, he studied at [[Selwyn College, Cambridge|Selwyn College]], [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]].&lt;ref name=Janus&gt;{{cite web | url=http://janus.lib.cam.ac.uk/db/node.xsp?id=EAD%2FGBR%2F0276%2FSEPP%2FCOT | title=Papers of Hugh Cott | publisher=Janus | work=SEPP/COT (formerly HC/1-2) | accessdate=25 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He had intended to become a priest, and went to Cambridge to read theology, but after his first year he went on the university expedition to [[South America]], where he studied natural forms in eastern [[Brazil]] in 1923, led by the [[entomologist]] [[William Alexander Francis Balfour Browne|Frank Balfour Browne]], where he became fascinated by [[natural history]], and changed his studies to zoology on his return.&lt;ref&gt;Forsyth, 2012. Page 127.&lt;/ref&gt; He then went on an expedition to the lower [[Amazon Basin|Amazon]] (1925–1926), and on research trips to the [[Zambesi river]] area in [[Africa]] (1927),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Zoological Society's Expedition to the Zambesi, 1927: No. 5. On a Collection of Lizards, mainly from Portuguese East Africa, with Descriptions of new Species of Zonurus, Monopeltis, and Chirindia.|author=Cott, Hugh B.|doi=10.1111/j.1469-7998.1934.tb06228.x|journal=Proceedings of the Zoological Society of London|volume =104|issue=1|pages=145–173|year=1934}}&lt;/ref&gt; including [[Mozambique]], [[Zambia]] and [[East Africa]], and [[Lanzarote]] (1930). He married Joyce Radford in 1928. He was a lecturer in Zoology at [[Bristol University]] from 1928 until 1932, when he moved to [[Glasgow University]]. He studied under another advocate of [[military camouflage]], [[John Graham Kerr]]. His thesis, which he completed in 1935 under a [[Carnegie Fellowship]], was on 'adaptive coloration' – both camouflage and [[warning coloration]] – in the [[Anura (frog)|Anura]] (frogs).&lt;ref name=Glasgow/&gt; In 1938 he was made a [[Doctor of Science]] at Glasgow, and he became a Zoology lecturer at [[Cambridge University]] and Strickland Curator of Birds at the [[Cambridge University Museum of Zoology|university's Museum of Zoology]].&lt;ref name=Glasgow/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kZqJAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT24&amp;lpg=PT24 | title=A Dictionary of Birds | publisher=A &amp; C Black |author1=Campbell, Bruce |author2=Lack, Elizabeth | year=2013 | pages=Entry: H.B.C. - Hugh Bamford Cott}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cott served in the Leicestershire Regiment of the [[British Army]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/31754/supplements/1086/page.pdf London Gazette 26 January 1920. Cott is in the Leicestershire Regiment.]&lt;/ref&gt; as a camouflage expert from 1919–1922, and, during the [[World War II|Second World War]], with the [[Royal Engineers]] as a camouflage instructor from 1939–1945.&lt;ref name=Glasgow&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.universitystory.gla.ac.uk/biography/?id=WH23977&amp;type=P | title=Hugh Bamford Cott | publisher=University of Glasgow | accessdate=17 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cott was chief instructor at the [[Camouflage Development and Training Camp]] at [[Helwan]], [[Egypt]], under filmmaker [[Geoffrey Barkas]] from its inception in November 1941.&lt;ref&gt;Forbes, Peter. (2009) Pages 155-156.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war, Cott returned to Cambridge, becoming a Fellow of Selwyn College in 1945; he worked there until he retired in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;Forsyth, 2012. Page 124.&lt;/ref&gt; He gave the Fison Memorial Lecture of 1958 on 'Protective Coloration in Animals'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.kcl.ac.uk/campuslife/services/grad/Memorial/memorial/fisonlectures.pdf | title=Fison Memorial Lectures | publisher=King's College London | accessdate=5 January 2014 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140106033004/http://www.kcl.ac.uk/campuslife/services/grad/Memorial/memorial/fisonlectures.pdf | archivedate=6 January 2014 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He continued to work from time to time after his retirement, for instance conducting a survey of [[crocodile]] nests on the Victoria [[Nile]] for the [[Uganda National Parks]] in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Scientific results of an inquiry into the ecology and economic status of the Nile Crocodile (Crocodilus niloticus) in Uganda and Northern Rhodesia|author=Cott, Hugh B.|year=1961|doi= 10.1111/j.1096-3642.1961.tb00220.x|journal=The Transactions of the Zoological Society of London|volume =29|issue=4|pages=211–356}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.iucncsg.org/365_docs/attachments/protarea/CSG%20-462a34a8.pdf | title=Newsletter No. 4 | publisher=IUCN Crocodile Specialists Group | date=April 1972 | accessdate=15 January 2014 | author=Pooley, Tony}}&lt;/ref&gt; He died at the age of 86 on 18 April 1987.&lt;ref name=Janus/&gt;

==Camouflage==
{{further|Adaptive Coloration in Animals|Camouflage}}
[[File:Disruptive Coloration by Hugh Cott 1940.jpg|thumb|[[Disruptive coloration]] by Hugh Cott, from ''[[Adaptive Coloration in Animals]]'' (1940)]]

While trying to photograph a hen [[red-legged partridge|partridge]] on her nest, Cott waited for hours for the bird to return, finally taking some pictures of the empty nest before giving up. On developing the photographs, he realized the bird had been there all along, perfectly camouflaged.&lt;ref&gt;Forsyth, 2012. Pages 122–123.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a [[camouflage]] expert during the [[Second World War]], Cott likened the functions of [[military camouflage]] to those of [[protective coloration]] in nature. The three main categories of coloration in his book ''[[Adaptive Coloration in Animals]]'' are [[crypsis|concealment]], [[mimicry|disguise]], and [[advertising coloration|advertisement]]. He studied, described and presented examples of such diverse camouflage effects as [[countershading|obliterative shading]], [[disruptive coloration|disruption]], differential blending, high contrast, [[coincident disruption]], [[disruptive eye mask|concealment of the eye]], contour obliteration, [[shadow]] elimination, and mimicry. In his wartime lectures at [[Farnham Castle]], he described nine categories of visual [[Deception in animals|deception]]:&lt;ref name=Forbes152&gt;Forbes, Peter. (2009) Page 152-3. Farnham Lecture No. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

# merging, e.g. hare, [[polar bear]]&lt;ref name=Forbes152/&gt;
# disruption, e.g. [[ringed plover]]&lt;ref name=Forbes152/&gt;
# disguise, e.g. [[stick insect]]&lt;ref name=Forbes152/&gt;
# mis-direction, e.g. butterfly and fish [[eyespot (mimicry)|eyespot]]s&lt;ref name=Forbes152/&gt;
# dazzle, e.g. some [[grasshopper]]s&lt;ref name=Forbes152/&gt;
# decoy, e.g. [[angler fish]]&lt;ref name=Forbes152/&gt;
# smokescreen, e.g. [[cuttlefish]]&lt;ref name=Forbes152/&gt;
# the dummy, e.g. flies, ants&lt;ref name=Forbes152/&gt;
# false display of strength, e.g. toads, lizards&lt;ref name=Forbes152/&gt;

[[File:Countershaded Rail-mounted Gun Camouflaged by Hugh Cott 1940.jpg|thumb|Two rail-mounted guns are shown in the photograph. A [[Countershading|countershaded]] one camouflaged by Hugh Cott (above) and one in conventional style (below), August 1940&lt;ref name=Forbes150/&gt;]]

Cott's account of all this (illustrated by his own pen and ink drawings) is the 550-page book ''Adaptive Coloration in Animals'' (1940).&lt;ref&gt;Cott, Hugh. (1940)&lt;/ref&gt; It was proof-read by Kerr, who commented on its publication 'It is by far the finest thing of the kind in existence'.&lt;ref&gt;Forsyth, 2012. Page 140.&lt;/ref&gt; His co-workers' first-hand accounts of his work in military camouflage can be found in the memoirs of two of his fellow camoufleurs: [[Julian Trevelyan]]&lt;ref&gt;Trevelyan, Julian. (1957)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Roland Penrose]].&lt;ref&gt;Penrose, Roland. (1981)&lt;/ref&gt;

Peter Forbes wrote of Cott's book:&lt;ref name=Forbes153&gt;Forbes, Peter. (2009) Page 153.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Cott's ''Adaptive Coloration in Animals'' must be the only compendious zoology tract ever to be packed in a soldier's kitbag. The book also marks the apotheosis of the descriptive [[natural history]] phase of mimicry studies. Although Cott does report experiments on predation to test the efficacy of mimicry and camouflage, the book is essentially a narrative of examples plus theory.&lt;ref name=Forbes153/&gt;}}

[[File:The Big Tower, Camouflaged (1943) (Art.IWM ART LD 3025).jpg|thumb|upright|Cott was critical of attempts at camouflage not based on "vigorous disruptive contrasts".&lt;ref name=Cott53/&gt; 1943 painting by Colin Moss of a cooling tower camouflaged with a landscape scene]]
The book was written as war loomed, and published in wartime. Cott makes use of his knowledge of natural history to draw parallels between survival in nature and in war,&lt;ref&gt;Forsyth, 2012. Pages 147–148.&lt;/ref&gt; and to advise on military camouflage, for example commenting:

{{quote|Various recent attempts to camouflage tanks, armoured cars, and the roofs of buildings with paint reveal an almost complete failure by those responsible to grasp the essential factor in the disguise of surface continuity and contour … in nature vigorous disruptive contrasts are frequently seen at work, and their wonderful effectiveness in hindering recognition needs to be experienced in the field to be fully appreciated.&lt;ref name=Cott53&gt;Cott, 1940. Pages 53–54. Cited in Forsyth, 2012. Page 149.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Forbes notes that ''Adaptive Coloration in Animals'' is a narrative, short on the experimentation that followed after the war, but Forbes continues:&lt;ref name=Forbes153/&gt;

{{quote|But Cott's book is still valuable today for its enormous range, for its passionate exposition of the theories of mimicry and camouflage.&lt;ref name=Forbes153/&gt;}}

Cott attempted to persuade the British army to use more effective camouflage techniques, including countershading. For example, in August 1940, with the [[Battle of Britain]] imminent, he painted two rail-mounted coastal guns, one in conventional style, one [[Countershading|countershaded]]. In [[aerial photograph]]s, the countershaded gun is essentially invisible.&lt;ref name=Forbes150&gt;Forbes, Peter. (2009) Pages 149-150.&lt;/ref&gt; Cott was triumphant, announcing:&lt;ref name=Forbes150/&gt;

{{quote|These photographs furnish most convincing proof of the effectiveness of countershading, and are especially valuable in that we have in them a direct comparison between the two methods.}}

However (like Kerr before him in the First World War), Cott did not succeed in influencing policy on camouflage, and he resigned from the Camouflage Advisory Panel in 1940.&lt;ref&gt;Forsyth, 2012. Page 173.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cott was a founding member of the [[Society of Wildlife Artists]], and a fellow of the [[Royal Photographic Society]].&lt;ref name=Glasgow/&gt; From material gathered in field expeditions, he made contributions to the Cambridge University zoological museum.

Cott possessed considerable artistic skill. Like [[Abbott Thayer]], he used his artistry in his scientific work, including in ''Adaptive Coloration in Animals'', to help argue the case he was making.&lt;ref name=Forbes153/&gt;  For example, his black-and-white potoo shows this rainforest bird sitting motionless on a mottled tree trunk, its behaviour and disruptive pattern combining to provide effective camouflage. The philosopher and jazz musician [[David Rothenberg]] wrote of Cott's art:&lt;ref name=Rothenberg&gt;{{cite book | title=Survival of the Beautiful: Art, Science and Evolution | publisher=Bloomsbury | author=Rothenberg, David | year=2011 | page=167}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In nature the visible and invisible dance back and forth with each other, depending on how much we have learned to see. The science and art of this magic merge into one at the moment we grasp it.&lt;ref name=Rothenberg/&gt;}}

==Writings==

In addition to ''Adaptive Coloration in Animals'', Cott wrote two essays on camouflage: “Camouflage in nature and in war” in the ''Royal Engineers Journal'' (December 1938), pp501–517; and ”Animal form in relation to appearance” in [[Lancelot Law Whyte]], ed. ''Aspects of form: a symposium on form in nature and art'' (London: Percy Lund Humphries, 1951). As a scientific illustrator and photographer, he also wrote three other books: ''Zoological photography in practice'' (1956); ''Uganda in black and white'' (1959); and ''Looking at animals: a zoologist in Africa'' (1975). He became interested in the relationship of bird colours with their role as warning colours, an idea that arose when he observed hornets attracted to some birds being skinned while ignoring others. This led him to study the palatability of birds and their eggs. Among his papers were several studies on the relative palatibility of the eggs based initially on the preferences of ferrets, rats and hedgehogs and later on the use of a panel of expert egg tasters. In one study he found that of 123 species of bird, the [[kittiwake]] eggs scored highly with 8.2 out of 10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.rspb.org.uk/community/placestovisit/bemptoncliffs/b/bemptoncliffs-blog/archive/2013/11/25/don-39-t-try-this-at-home.aspx | title=Don't try this at home | publisher=Royal Society for the Protection of Birds | date=25 November 2013 | accessdate=5 January 2014 | author=Prchlik, Maria}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The palatability of the eggs of birds: mainly based upon observations of an Egg Panel|author=Cott, Hugh B.|doi=10.1111/j.1469-7998.1954.tb07786.x| year=1954| journal=Proceedings of the Zoological Society of London|volume=124|issue= 2|pages=335–464}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Edibility of Birds: Illustrated by Five Years' Experiments and Observations (1941–1946) on the Food Preferences of the Hornet, Cat and Man;and considered with Special Reference to the Theories of Adaptive Coloration|author=Cott, Hugh B.|doi=10.1111/j.1096-3642.1947.tb00131.x|year=1947| journal=Proceedings of the Zoological Society of London|volume =116|issue=3-4|pages=371–524}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Ostrich: Journal of African Ornithology| volume =40|year=1969|title=The palatability of birds, mainly based upon observations of a tasting panel in Zambia|doi=10.1080/00306525.1969.9639135|author1=Cott, Hugh B.  |author2=C.

==Legacy==

The journalist and author Peter Forbes praised Cott's balance of science and artistry:&lt;ref name=Forbes153/&gt;

{{quote|..in the conflict between artists and biologists, he was both. Cott was a competent illustrator as well as a biologist. Without having [[Nabokov]]'s precisianism and anti-Darwinism, he brought an artistic sensibility to bear on these phenomena. His text is radiant with the wonder of these [[adaptation]]s.&lt;ref name=Forbes153/&gt;}}

Over 60 years after its publication, ''Adaptive Coloration in Animals'' remains a core reference on the subject; the
[[Evolutionary biology|evolutionary biologists]] [[Graeme Ruxton]], [[Thomas N. Sherratt]] and Michael Speed conclude their book on [[animal coloration]] by writing

{{quote|The study of animal coloration and associated [[anti-predator adaptation]]s has a long history... this field of research has been blessed from the earliest years with the insights of particularly gifted scientists. The writings of [[Alfred Russel Wallace|Wallace]], [[Henry Walter Bates|Bates]], [[Fritz Müller|Müller]], [[Edward Bagnall Poulton|Poulton]] and Cott truly stand up to the test of time: these individuals deserve even better renown not just as great [[Natural history|natural historians]] but as exceptional scientists too.&lt;ref&gt;Ruxton, Sherratt and Speed, 2004. p. 200.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The biologist [[Steven Vogel]] commented that:&lt;ref&gt;Vogel, Steven. [http://www.americanscientist.org/bookshelf/pub/the-deceptional-life The Deceptional Life].'' American Scientist. On the Bookshelf. September–October 2010. Volume 98, Number 5. Page: 436 DOI: 10.1511/2010.86.436&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The zoologist Hugh Cott had the final word in ''Adaptive Coloration in Animals'' (1940), a definitive synthesis of everything known about [[camouflage]] and [[mimicry]] in nature. Cott ruffled fewer feathers [than [[Trofim Lysenko]] or [[Vladimir Nabokov]]], and his well-organized and unfanatic ideas proved militarily effective, even under the scrutiny of improved techniques for target detection. [[Abbott Handerson Thayer|Thayer]]’s principles reemerged in more temperate and rational terms, and camouflage schemes based on them survived both photometric analyses and enemy encounters. [[Biomimetic]] camouflage took its place as yet another technique in a sophisticated armamentarium of visual deceptions.}}

An exhibition of his art, writing, and photographs, 'Life, Lines &amp; Illusion', was held at the [[Nature in Art]] gallery in Gloucester in September and October 2018.&lt;ref name="NiA"&gt;{{cite web |title=Life, Lines &amp; Illusion |url=https://natureinart.org.uk/event/life-lines-illusion/?instance_id=417 |publisher=[[Nature In Art]] |accessdate=12 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5129">'''Implicit leadership theory''' ('''ILT''') is a [[Cognitive psychology|cognitive theory]] of [[leadership]] developed by Robert Lord and colleagues.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Forsyth, D. R. (2009). ''Group dynamics.'' New York, New York: Wadsworth.&lt;/ref&gt; It is based on the idea that individuals create cognitive representations of the world, and use these preconceived notions to interpret their surroundings and control their [[Behavior|behaviors]].&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Schyns, B., &amp; Meindl, J. R. (2005). ''Implicit leadership theories: Essays and explorations.'' Information Age Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; ILT suggests that group members have implicit expectations and assumptions about the [[Personality|personal characteristics]], traits, and qualities that are inherent in a leader.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;  These assumptions, termed implicit leadership theories or leader prototypes, guide an individual's [[Perception|perceptions]] and responses to leaders.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; The term implicit is used because they are not outwardly stated and the term theory is used because it involves the generalization of past experiences to new experiences.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; ILTs allow individuals to identify leaders and aid them in responding appropriately to leaders in order to [[Conflict avoidance|avoid conflict]].&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

== Individual differences ==

Although ILTs vary between [[individual]]s, many overlap in terms of the task skills and relationship skills that leaders should possess in order to be successful.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; In terms of task skills, most people seek a leader that is in control, determined, influential, and continuously involved in the group activities. When considering relationship skills, most people tend to prefer a leader who is caring, honest, open to new ideas, and interested in the group work.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; In a study by Offermann, Kennedy, and Wirtz (1994), the content and factor structure variation of male and female ILTs were compared across three stimuli, being leaders, effective leaders, and supervisors. They found that eight factors of the ILTs were rather stable across all participants, between males and females, and across the three stimuli. These eight factors were [[charisma]], sensitivity, dedication, [[intelligence]], [[attractiveness]], [[masculinity]], [[tyranny]], and strength. The results from this study suggest that, although ILTs differ depending on the individual, this variation may be systematic and, at times, predictable.

== Biases ==

The [[social world]] is solely understood in terms of perceptions, thus people use these perceptions intuitively to effectively organize and guide [[social interactions]].&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; We observe the actions of other people, take note of their personal characteristics, compare them to our own ILTs, and make decisions regarding whether they make an appropriate or inappropriate leader.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Additionally, we use ILTs to evaluate the suitability and [[effectiveness]] of a group's leader.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; For example, if you believe that a good leader exerts control over the group, you may focus on this specific characteristic. Consequently, [[bias]] can result from noting only the instances when the leader was or was not in control. In a study by Foti and Lord (1987), participants were shown a videotape of a leader-group interaction. The participants were told to report the behaviors that the leader had or had not performed. The results of this study indicated that people are quicker to respond, more accurate, and more confident when they are judging behaviors that are both part of their ILTs and performed by the leader, in comparison to behaviors that were part of their ILTs and were not performed by the leader. Since ILTs are implicit theories, meaning the individual is likely unaware of their biases, it is difficult for ineffective ILTs to be recognized and discarded.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; For example, Offermann et al. (1994) found that masculinity was a stable ILT across participants, sex, and stimuli. However, males tend to be more [[autocratic]] and [[Task-oriented and relationship-oriented leadership|task-oriented]] in leadership style, while females tend to adopt a more [[Participative decision-making|participative]] and relationship-oriented style.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Consequently, females generally tend to make better leaders as they have a more collaborative approach. This bias would be difficult to correct, as people are typically not aware of their [[implicit assumption]]s.

'''James William Benson''' (12 April 1826 – 7 October 1878) was an English scientific instrument maker, gold/silversmith, and [[watchmaker]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/search_the_collection_database/term_details.aspx?bioId=91041|title=J W Benson Ltd (Biographical details)|work=britishmuseum.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
James William Benson was born in Reading, [[Berkshire]], England. He was the son of William Benson and Phoebe Suckley.

== Career ==
The Benson family had been watchmakers since 1749. A company, trading as S.S. &amp; J.W. Benson, was founded  in 1847 by James William Benson (born in 1826 in Reading) and his older brother Samuel Suckley Benson  (born in 1822 in London). The partnership was dissolved on 27 January 1855 and James William continued the business under the name, ‘J. W.  Benson’.  James William Benson died on 7 October 1878, aged 52, and  his sons James, Alfred and Arthur took over the running of the business.

Throughout  its history, J.W. Benson Ltd was official watchmaker to the Admiralty &amp; the War  Department and also held a number of royal warrants, being watchmakers to Queen  Victoria, the Prince of Wales, the Tsar of Russia and several other royal  families.

The  company's premises were: Cornhill (1847–64), Ludgate Hill (1854-1937), Old Bond  Street (1872-3), Royal Exchange (1892-1937) and their original workshop was at  4-5 Horseshoe Court (at the rear of their Ludgate Hill premises). In 1892 it  became a limited company and moved to their new 'steam' factory at 38 Belle Sauvage Yard.

During W.W.II. the factory was bombed, destroying thousands of timepieces and from this point on the company no  longer manufactured its own watches, but still continued as a retailer. The  timepieces bearing the company name used high quality Swiss movements supplied  by manufacturers such as, Vertex (Revue), Cyma/Tavannes, Longines and by the  English maker, S. Smith &amp; Sons.

J. W. Benson Ltd continued until 1973 at  which time the name was sold to the Royal jewellers, Garrards.

'''Lentisphaerae''' is a [[phylum]] of [[bacteria]] closely related to [[Chlamydiae]] and [[Verrucomicrobia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cho J, Vergin K, Morris R, Giovannoni S | title = Lentisphaera araneosa gen. nov., sp. nov, a transparent exopolymer producing marine bacterium, and the description of a novel bacterial phylum, Lentisphaerae | journal = Environ Microbiol | volume = 6 | issue = 6 | pages = 611–21 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15142250 | doi = 10.1111/j.1462-2920.2004.00614.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid20962908"&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Limam RD, Bouchez T, Chouari R, etal |title=Detection of WWE2-related Lentisphaerae by 16S rRNA gene sequencing and fluorescence in situ hybridization in landfill leachate |journal=Can.

It includes two monotypic orders [[Lentisphaerales]] and [[Victivallales]].  Phylum members can be [[Aerobic organism|aerobic]] or [[Anaerobic organism|anaerobic]] and fall under two distinct phenotypes.  One consists of terrestrial gut microbiota from mammals and birds.  The other phenotype includes marine micro-organisms: sequences from fish and coral microbiomes and marine sediment.

The '''maximum acceptable toxicant concentration''' (MATC) is a value that is calculated through [[Aquatic Toxicology|aquatic]] toxicity tests to help set [[water quality]] regulations for the protection of aquatic life. Using the results of a partial life-cycle [[chronic toxicity]] test, the MATC is reported as the [[geometric mean]] between the No Observed Effect Concentration ([[No-observed-adverse-effect level|NOEC]]) and the lowest observed effect concentration ([[Lowest-observed-adverse-effect level|LOEC]]).&lt;ref name="Rand1"/&gt;

The MATC is used to set regulatory standards for priority pollutants&lt;ref name="EPAPP"/&gt; under the US federal [[Clean Water Act]]. Regulatory guidelines give two acceptable concentrations of pollutants to protect against effects: chronic or acute. Since the MATC should only be reported in chronic toxicity tests, there is a widely accepted method to convert the chronic MATC to a concentration that protects against acute effects.&lt;ref name="Rand1"/&gt;

The MATC is calculated and reported from the results of a number of standard procedures designed by the United States [[Environmental Protection Agency]] (US EPA) and other organizations to maintain high accuracy and precision among all toxicity tests for regulatory purposes.

==Calculation==

===Chronic toxicity tests===
In a toxicity test, the NOEC and LOEC are derived as a comparison from the [[Scientific control|negative control]], or the experimental group that does not contain the chemical in question. The NOEC is the highest concentration that does not cause a statistically different effect than the negative control through [[statistical hypothesis testing]]. Likewise, the LOEC is the lowest concentration tested that does cause a statistically different effect than the negative control. The MATC is the geometric mean between these two values, such that: MATC={{math|{{radical|(NOEC)(LOEC)}}}}

The MATC is calculated to protect against chronic effects on overall function or health of an organism, not death. A partial life cycle test must be used. This type of toxicity test uses organisms in their most sensitive life stages, usually during times of early reproduction and growth, but not juveniles.&lt;ref name="Rand2"/&gt; The MATC is the highest concentration that should not cause chronic effects, however, for regulatory purposes, a maximum concentration to protect against acute effects must exist as well.

===Applying MATC to acutely toxic concentrations===
The MATC can be applied to the results of an acute toxicity test to obtain a concentration that would protect against adverse effects during an acute exposure. An [[Median lethal dose|LC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;]], or the concentration at which 50% of the organisms die during an acute toxicity test is used to derive a value called the acute to chronic ratio (ACR).

The MATC can be used to calculate the ACR as follows: &lt;math&gt; ACR= LC50/MATC &lt;/math&gt;

The ACR is useful for estimating an MATC for species in which only acute toxicity data exists, or for setting regulatory guidelines for the protection of aquatic life through water quality criteria by the US EPA.&lt;ref name="Rand2"/&gt;

==Regulatory uses==

===United States===
The US EPA is the governmental organization responsible for writing and enforcing environmental regulations passed by Congress. The [[Clean Water Act]] was passed in 1972.

Section 304(a)(1) of the Clean Water Act is the Water Quality Criteria (WQC) developed for the protection of aquatic life and human health.&lt;ref name="EPAWQC"/&gt; The MATC and ACR are used in a sequence of calculations to obtain the Criterion Maximum Concentration and Criterion Continuous Concentration (CMC and CCC, respectively) for the chemicals being regulated.&lt;ref name="CCCCMC"/&gt;

The CMC and CCC are two of the six parts of the aquatic life criterion under the WQC, and are the actual regulatory values for all priority pollutants tested. The CMC is the highest concentration of a chemical in water that aquatic organisms can be exposed to acutely without causing an adverse effect. Likewise, the CCC is the highest concentration of a chemical in water that aquatic organisms can be exposed to indefinitely without resulting in an adverse effect. Typically, the CMC is higher than the CCC.&lt;ref name="CCCCMC"/&gt;

===Canada===
[[Environment Canada]] is the regulatory agency for environmental protection in Canada. Under the Canada Water Act of 1970, the Canadian Water Quality Guidelines (CWQG) for the Protection of Aquatic Life give regulatory guidelines of maximum concentrations of pollutants that are acceptable in freshwater and marine environments.&lt;ref name="CCME"/&gt;

The CWQG's long and short-term exposure concentrations are derived in a similar way as the methods used by the US EPA, and are the CMC or CCC equivalents.&lt;ref name="CCMEDERV"/&gt; When an MATC is reported with toxicity tests, it has sometimes been called a threshold-observed-effect-concentration (TOEC). The MATC and TOEC are both calculated as the geometric mean of the NOEC and LOEC, and are often used interchangeably.&lt;ref name="CCMEDERV"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CASTAT"/&gt;

===Standard methods===

Standard methods are designed and used widely to maximize precision and accuracy for all toxicity tests. Values derived from toxicity tests such as the MATC are reported to regulatory organizations like the US EPA and Environment Canada so more confident regulations can be designed.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

Some common standard methods include those designed by the governmental organizations like Environment Canada, the US EPA, or the United States [[Food and Drug Administration|Food and Drug Administration (FDA)]]. Others are designed by scientific organizations such as [[ASTM International]], or the [[OECD]].

Many of these methods use the same test organism or are designed for the same exposure time. Common test organisms include, but are not limited to, [[daphnia]], [[fathead minnow]], [[rainbow trout]], and [[mussel]]s. Acute toxicity tests are normally 24–96 hours, whereas chronic tests will typically run for a week or longer.

==Advantages and limitations==

Using the MATC to derive regulatory guidelines has been accompanied with some debate. Hypothesis testing, or statistical tests performed with data sets that only report a significant difference, are not considered the most statistically robust. There are no confidence intervals to show a measure of uncertainty in a NOEC and LOEC. In addition, the NOEC and LOEC can only be concentrations in the test, and nothing in between.&lt;ref name="RAND3"/&gt; Because of these reasons, values that are derived through curve fitting methods, such as an LC50, or EC10 (the concentration that causes the measured effect in 10% of organisms) would be preferred if it was possible more often.

From a regulatory standpoint, there are advantages to using results from hypothesis tests. NOEC and LOEC’s were used more often in the past, and there are more test results reporting NOEC and LOEC’s than EC10’s. The time and effort required to perform all of the previous tests to derive a different value is not seen as a good use of resources. In addition, the use of NOEC and LOEC’s allows for reporting of one number to regulatory agencies.&lt;ref name="CASTAT"/&gt; Water Quality Criteria are reported as one number that the actual concentration must remain below. If the MATC were reported as a range of values to account for uncertainty, the regulatory guidelines would not be presented as a single value.

'''[[Mercury program|Mercury]]-[[Mercury-Redstone Launch Vehicle|Redstone]] 1A''' (MR-1A) was launched on December 19, 1960 from [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Launch Complex 5|LC-5]] at [[Cape Canaveral]], [[Florida]]. The mission objectives of this unmanned suborbital flight were to [[flight qualify|qualify]] the spacecraft for space flight and qualify the system for an upcoming primate suborbital flight. The spacecraft tested its instrumentation, posigrade rockets, [[retrorocket]]s and recovery system. The mission was completely successful. The Mercury capsule reached an altitude of {{convert|130|mi|km}} and a range of {{convert|235|mi|km}}. The launch vehicle reached a slightly higher velocity than expected - {{convert|4909|mph|km/h}}. The Mercury spacecraft was recovered from the [[Atlantic Ocean]] by recovery helicopters about 15 minutes after landing. Serial numbers: Mercury Spacecraft #2 was reflown on MR-1A, together with the escape tower from Capsule #8 and the antenna fairing from Capsule #10. Redstone MRLV-3 was used. The flight time was 15 minutes and 45 seconds.

==Current location==
Mercury spacecraft #2, used in both the [[Mercury-Redstone 1]] and Mercury-Redstone 1A missions, is currently displayed at the [[NASA Ames Exploration Center]], [[Moffett Federal Airfield]], near [[Mountain View, California|Mountain View]], [[California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=NASA Ames Exploration Center |url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/ames/home/exploration.html |publisher=[[NASA Ames Research Center]] |accessdate=2009-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''normalized difference red edge index''' ('''NDRE''') is a [[wikt:metric#Noun|metric]] that can be used to analyse whether images obtained from [[Multispectral image|multi-spectral image]] sensors contain healthy vegetation or not. It is similar to [[Normalized Difference Vegetation Index]] (NDVI) but uses the ratio of Near-Infrared and the edge of Red as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;\mbox{NDRE}=\frac{(\mbox{NIR}-\mbox{RE})}{(\mbox{NIR}+\mbox{RE})}&lt;/math&gt;

The red edge is the term used to describe the part of the spectrum centred around 715&amp;nbsp;nm.

 |-
 !style="background:#ffdead;" | Name&lt;ref group=note&gt;The US, France and Great Britain have code-named their test events, while the USSR and China did not, and therefore have only test numbers (with some exceptions &amp;ndash; Soviet peaceful explosions were named). Word translations into English in parentheses unless the name is a proper noun. A dash followed by a number indicates a member of a salvo event.  The US also sometimes named the individual explosions in such a salvo test, which results in "name1 &amp;ndash; 1(with name2)". If test is canceled or aborted, then the row data like date and location discloses the intended plans, where known.&lt;/ref&gt;
 !style="background:#efefef;" | Date time ([[Universal Time|UT]])
 !style="background:#ffdead;" | Local [[Time Zone|time zone]]&lt;ref group=note&gt;To convert the UT time into standard local, add the number of hours in parentheses to the UT time; for local daylight saving time, add one additional hour. If the result is earlier than 00:00, add 24 hours and subtract 1 from the day; if it is 24:00 or later, subtract 24 hours and add 1 to the day. All historical timezone data are derived from here:&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Timezone Historical Database| publisher=iana.com| url=http://www.ietf.org/timezones/| accessdate=March 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some locations are extremely accurate; others (like airdrops and space blasts) may be quite inaccurate. "~" indicates a likely pro-forma rough location, shared with other tests in that same area.&lt;/ref&gt;
 !style="background:#ffdead;" | [[Elevation]] + height&lt;ref group=note&gt;Elevation is the ground level at the point directly below the explosion relative to sea level; height is the additional distance added or subtracted by tower, balloon, shaft, tunnel, air drop or other contrivance. For rocket bursts the ground level is "N/A". In some cases it is not clear if the height is absolute or relative to ground, for example, ''Plumbbob/John''.  No number or units indicates the value is unknown, while "0" means zero. Sorting on this column is by elevation and height added together.&lt;/ref&gt;
 !style="background:#efefef;" | Delivery&lt;ref group=note&gt;Atmospheric, airdrop, balloon, gun, cruise missile, rocket, surface, tower, and barge are all disallowed by the [[Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty]]. Sealed shaft and tunnel are underground, and remained useful under the PTBT. Intentional cratering tests are borderline; they occurred under the treaty, were sometimes protested, and generally overlooked if the test was declared to be a peaceful use.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Purpose&lt;ref group=note&gt;Include weapons development, weapon effects, safety test, transport safety test, war, science, joint verification and industrial/peaceful, which may be further broken down.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Our Synthetic Environment''''' is a 1962 book by [[Murray Bookchin]], published under the pseudonym "Lewis Herber".

==Summary==
Bookchin warns of the dangers of [[pesticide]] use, and espouses an [[ecological]] and [[environmentalist]] worldview.

==Influence==
''Our Synthetic Environment'' was one of the first books of the modern period in which an author espoused an ecological and environmentalist worldview. It predates ''[[Silent Spring]]'' (1962) by [[Rachel Carson]], a more widely known book on the same topic widely credited as starting the environmental movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The '''POlarization Emission of Millimeter Activity at the Sun (POEMAS)''' is a solar patrol system composed of two radio telescopes with [[superheterodyne receiver|superheterodyne]] [[polarization (waves)|circular polarization]] receivers at 45 and 90&amp;nbsp;GHz. Since their [[half power beam width]] is around 1.4°, they observe the full sun. The acquisition system allows to gather 100 values per second at both frequencies and polarizations, with a sensitivity of around 20 [[solar flux units|solar flux units (SFU)]] (1 SFU ≡ 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; [[Jansky|Jy]]). The telescope saw [[First light (astronomy)|first light]] in November 2011, and showed excellent performance during two years, when it observed many [[solar flare|flares]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11207-013-0237-4 Válio, A., Kaufmann, P., Giménez de Castro, C.G., Raulin, J.-P., Fernández, L.O.T., Marún, A., ''POlarization Emission of Millimeter Activity at the Sun (POEMAS): New Circular Polarization Solar Telescopes at Two Millimeter Wavelength Ranges, Solar Phys., 283(2), 651, DOI:10.1007/s11207-013-0237-4]&lt;/ref&gt; Since November 2013 is stopped for repairing. The main interest of POEMAS is the observation of [[solar flare]]s in a frequency range where there are very few detectors and fill the gap between [[microwave]]s observed with the [[Radio Solar Telescope Network]] (1 to 15.4&amp;nbsp;GHz) and submillimeter observations of the [[Solar Submillimeter Telescope]] (212 and 405&amp;nbsp;GHz). Moreover, POEMAS is the only current telescope capable of carrying on circular polarization [[solar flare]] observations at 90&amp;nbsp;GHz. (Although, in principle, [[Atacama Large Millimeter Array|ALMA]] band 3 may also observe at 90&amp;nbsp;GHz with circular polarization&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.almaobservatory.org/en/about-alma/how-does-alma-work/technology/front-end ALMA Front End]&lt;/ref&gt;).

==Science==

POEMAS was designed to ''fill the gap'' between microwaves and submillimeter (less than 1&amp;nbsp;mm) [[wavelength]] observations of the solar activity. There are a number of different instruments around the world that monitors the sun at microwaves. The [[Nobeyama radio observatory|Nobeyama Radio Heliograph (NoRH)]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1994IEEEP..82..705N Nakajima, H., et al., Proc. IEEE, 82(5),705, 1994]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Takano, T., et al., ''An Upgrade of Nobeyama Radioheliograph to a Dual-Frequency (17 and 34 GHz) System'', in ''Coronal Physics from Radio and Space Observations''; Proceedings of the CESRA Workshop held in Nouan le Fuzelier, France 3–7 June 1996, edited by Gerard Trottet, Published by Springer, p.183,(1997)&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Nobeyama]], [[Japan]]) makes daily maps at 17&amp;nbsp;GHz (1.7&amp;nbsp;cm) with circular left and right polarizations and 34&amp;nbsp;GHz (8.8&amp;nbsp;mm), total intensity.  The Nobeyama Radio Polarimeters (NoRP),&lt;ref&gt;[http://solar.nro.nao.ac.jp/norp/ NoRP Official Site]&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Nobeyama]], [[Japan]]) is a set of patrol telescopes with receivers from 1&amp;nbsp;GHz (λ≈30&amp;nbsp;cm) to 80&amp;nbsp;GHz (λ≈3.7&amp;nbsp;mm) at selected frequencies and circular polarization detection (except at 80&amp;nbsp;GHz) with full sun disk spatial resolution. The [[Radio Solar Telescope Network|Radio Solar Telescope Network (RSTN)]] is worldwide network of telescopes with receivers at selected bands from few hundred MHz (λ≈75&amp;nbsp;cm) to 15.4&amp;nbsp;GHz (λ≈2&amp;nbsp;cm). At the other end of the band, the [[Solar Submillimeter Telescope| Solar Submillimeter Telescope (SST)]] installed at [[Complejo Astronomico El Leoncito]] in [[San Juan Province, Argentina]] observes the sun at 212&amp;nbsp;GHz (λ≈1.4&amp;nbsp;mm) and 405&amp;nbsp;GHz (λ≈0.7&amp;nbsp;mm).  Since there is no observational time overlap between Japan and Argentina, the NoRH and NoRP cannot be used together with SST, and only data from some RSTN observatories have times in common with the SST.

The relevance of observing at 45 and 90&amp;nbsp;GHz comes from the necessity to determine the ''upturn'' frequency in the so-called ''THz events'': if the main radiation mechanism is [[synchrotron radiation]] from accelerated electrons emitting at [[chromosphere|chromospheric]] or [[corona]]l heights, it is expected a spectrum with a long and descending logarithmic tail towards millimeter wavelengths.  In some cases this classical (''textbook'') shape is broken and an ''upturn'' or ''spectral reversion'' is observed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://iopscience.iop.org/1538-4357/603/2/L121/ Kaufmann, P., et al., ''A New Solar Burst Spectral Component Emitting Only in the Terahertz Range'', Astrophys. Jour, 603, L121 (2004)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aanda.org/index.php?option=com_article&amp;access=bibcode&amp;Itemid=129&amp;bibcode=2004A%2526A...420..361LFUL Lüthi, T., Lüdi, A., Magun, A., Astron. &amp; Astrophys., 420, 361 (2004)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11207-007-9044-0 Silva, A.V.R., et al., ''Evidence that Synchrotron Emission from Nonthermal Electrons Produces the Increasing Submillimeter Spectral Component in Solar Flares'', Sol. Phys, 241(2),311 (2007)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11207-008-9312-7 Kaufmann, P. et al. ''Sub-terahertz, Microwaves and High Energy Emissions During the 6 December 2006 Flare, at 18:40 UT'', Sol. Phys., 255(1),131 (2009)]&lt;/ref&gt; Since the reversion or ''upturn'' frequency has been estimated around 50 to 100&amp;nbsp;GHz for the observed cases, the importance of POEMAS is justified.

In [[psychology]] and [[cognitive science]], the '''positivity effect''' is the ability to constructively analyze a situation where the desired results are not achieved; but still obtain positive feedback that assists our future progression. When a person is considering people they like (including themselves), the person tends to make situational attributions about their negative behaviors and dispositional attributions about their positive behaviors. The reverse may be true for people that the person dislikes. This may well be because of the [[cognitive dissonance|dissonance]] between liking a person and seeing them behave negatively.
Example: If a friend hits someone, one would tell them the other guy deserved it or that he had to defend himself.

== In attribution==
{{Main article|Selective perception}}
The positivity effect pertains to the tendency of people, when evaluating the causes of the behaviors of a person they like or prefer, to attribute the person's inherent disposition as the cause of their positive behaviors and the situations surrounding them as the cause of their negative behaviors. The positivity effect is the inverse of the ''[[negativity effect]]'', which is found when people evaluate the causes of the behaviors of a person they dislike. Both effects are [[attributional bias]]es.

== In perception ==
On online social networks like [[Twitter]], users prefer to share positive news, and are emotionally affected by positive news more than twice than by negative news.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title = Measuring Emotional Contagion in Social Media |journal = [[PLoS ONE]] |volume = 10 |issue = 1 |year = 2015 |pages = e0142390 |doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0142390|last1 = Ferrara |first1 = Emilio |last2 = Yang |first2 = Zeyao |pmid=26544688 |pmc=4636231}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |title = Quantifying the effect of sentiment on information diffusion in social media |journal = Peer J Computer Science |volume = 1 |year = 2015 |pages = e26 |doi = 10.7717/peerj-cs.26|last1 = Ferrara |first1 = Emilio |last2 = Yang |first2 = Zeyao }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Project Ozma''' was a pioneering [[SETI]] experiment started in 1960 by [[Cornell University]] astronomer [[Frank Drake]], at the [[National Radio Astronomy Observatory]] at [[Green Bank, West Virginia]]. The object of the experiment was to search for signs of life in distant [[planetary system]]s through interstellar radio waves.  The program was named after [[Princess Ozma]], ruler of the fictional [[land of Oz]], inspired by [[L. Frank Baum]]'s supposed communication with Oz by radio to learn of the events in the books taking place after ''[[The Emerald City of Oz]]''.&lt;ref name="SETI"&gt;SETI Institute. "Early SETI: Project Ozma, Arecibo Message." Web page at https://www.seti.org/seti-institute/project/details/early-seti-project-ozma-arecibo-message.&lt;/ref&gt;  The search was publicized in articles in the popular media of the time, such as [[Time (magazine)|''Time'' magazine]].&lt;ref&gt;"Science: Project Ozma," [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,874057,00.html ''Time,'' Apr. 18, 1960]&lt;/ref&gt;

Drake used a radio telescope with a diameter of {{convert|85|ft|m|sp=us}} to examine the stars [[Tau Ceti]] and [[Epsilon Eridani]] near the 1.420 gigahertz marker frequency.&lt;ref name="SETI" /&gt; Both are nearby Sun-like stars that then seemed reasonably likely to have inhabited planets.  A 400 kilohertz band was scanned around the marker frequency, using a single-channel receiver with a bandwidth of 100 hertz. The information was stored on tape for off-line analysis. Some 150 hours of intermittent observation during a four-month period detected no recognizable signals.  A false signal was detected on April 8, 1960, but it was determined to have originated from a high-flying aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Jean | last=Heidmann |author2=Dunlop, Storm| title=Extraterrestrial intelligence | year=1995 | publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]| isbn=0-521-58563-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The receiver was tuned to wavelengths near 21&amp;nbsp;cm, which is the wavelength of radiation emitted naturally by interstellar hydrogen; it was thought that this would be familiar, as a kind of universal standard, to anyone attempting interstellar radio communication.&lt;ref name="Darling"&gt;Darling, David. "Ozma, Project," in The Internet Encyclopedia of Science. Web page at http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/O/Ozma.html.&lt;/ref&gt;

A second experiment, called Ozma II, was conducted with a larger ({{convert|300|ft|m|sp=us}}) telescope at the same observatory by [[Patrick Palmer (astronomer)|Patrick Palmer]] and [[Benjamin Zuckerman]], who intermittently monitored 670 nearby stars for about four years (1972–76).&lt;ref name="PZ"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zuckerman|first1=B.|last2=Tarter|first2=J.|title=Microwave searches in the U.S.A. and Canada|journal=Strategies for the search for life in the universe (Proceedings)|date=1980|pages=81–92|bibcode=1980ASSL...83...81Z|doi=10.1007/978-94-009-9115-6_10}}&lt;/ref&gt; They examined a 10&amp;nbsp;MHz bandwidth with 52&amp;nbsp;kHz resolution and a 625&amp;nbsp;kHz bandwidth with 4&amp;nbsp;kHz resolution.  The spectrometer was centered on the 21&amp;nbsp;cm hydrogen line in the rest frame of each observed star.&lt;ref name="PZ"/&gt;

'''Pseudoscience''' consists of statements, [[belief]]s, or practices that are claimed to be both scientific and factual, but are incompatible with the [[scientific method]].&lt;ref name="Cover_Curd_1998"/&gt;{{refn|group=Note|Definition:
* "A pretended or spurious science; a collection of related beliefs about the world mistakenly regarded as being based on scientific method or as having the status that scientific truths now have," ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', second edition 1989.
* "Many writers on pseudoscience have emphasized that pseudoscience is non-science posing as science. The foremost modern classic on the subject (Gardner 1957) bears the title ''[[Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science]]''. According to Brian Baigrie (1988, 438), '[w]hat is objectionable about these beliefs is that they masquerade as genuinely scientific ones.' These and many other authors assume that to be pseudoscientific, an activity or a teaching has to satisfy the following two criteria (Hansson 1996): (1) it is not scientific, and (2) its major proponents try to create the impression that it is scientific."&lt;ref name="SEP section SciPse"/&gt;
* '"claims presented so that they appear [to be] scientific even though they lack supporting evidence and plausibility"(p. 33). In contrast, science is "a set of methods designed to describe and interpret observed and inferred phenomena, past or present, and aimed at building a testable body of knowledge open to rejection or confirmation"(p. 17)'&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Shermer|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; (this was the [https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/seind02/c7/c7s5.htm definition adopted by] the [[National Science Foundation]])}} Pseudoscience is often characterized by contradictory, exaggerated or [[falsifiability|unfalsifiable claims]]; reliance on [[confirmation bias]] rather than rigorous attempts at refutation; lack of openness to evaluation by other experts; and absence of systematic practices when developing theories, and continued adherence long after they have been experimentally discredited. The term ''pseudoscience'' is considered [[pejorative]]&lt;ref name="Freitsch"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Frietsch|first1=Ute|name-list-format=vanc|title=The boundaries of science / pseudoscience|journal=European History Online (EGO)|date=7 April 2015|url=http://ieg-ego.eu/en/threads/crossroads/knowledge-spaces/ute-frietsch-the-boundaries-of-science-pseudoscience|access-date=15 April 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170415202501/http://ieg-ego.eu/en/threads/crossroads/knowledge-spaces/ute-frietsch-the-boundaries-of-science-pseudoscience|archivedate=15 April 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; because it suggests something is being presented as science inaccurately or even deceptively.

The [[demarcation problem|demarcation]] between science and pseudoscience has [[philosophical]] and [[scientific]] implications.&lt;ref name=Imre-Lakatos/&gt; Differentiating science from pseudoscience has practical implications in the case of [[health care]], [[Expert witness|expert testimony]], [[Environmental policy|environmental policies]], and [[science education]].&lt;ref name="Stanford-Demarcations"/&gt; Distinguishing scientific facts and theories from pseudoscientific beliefs, such as those found in [[astrology]], [[alchemy]], [[alternative medicine]], [[occult]] beliefs, and [[creation science]], is part of science education and [[scientific literacy]].&lt;ref name="Stanford-Demarcations"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hurd/&gt;

Pseudoscience can cause negative consequences in the real world. [[Antivaccine]] activists present pseudoscientific studies that falsely call into question the safety of vaccines. [[Homeopathy|Homeopathic]] remedies with no active ingredients have been promoted as treatment for deadly diseases.

==Etymology==
The word ''pseudoscience'' is derived from the Greek root ''pseudo'' meaning false&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=The Free Dictionary |chapter=pseudo |publisher=Farlex, Inc. |year=2015 |chapter-url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/pseudo |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Online Etymology Dictionary | url = https://www.etymonline.com/search?q=pseudo |year=2015 |publisher=Douglas Harper}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the English word ''science'', from the Latin word ''scientia'', meaning "knowledge". Although the term has been in use since at least the late 18th century (e.g. in 1796 by [[James Pettit Andrews]] in reference to alchemy&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|pseudoscience}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Andrews|Henry|1796|p=87}}&lt;/ref&gt;) the concept of pseudoscience as distinct from real or proper science seems to have become more widespread during the mid-19th century. Among the earliest uses of "pseudo-science" was in an 1844 article in the ''Northern Journal of Medicine'', issue 387:
{{quote|text=That opposite kind of innovation which pronounces what has been recognized as a branch of science, to have been a pseudo-science, composed merely of so-called facts, connected together by misapprehensions under the disguise of principles.}}

An earlier use of the term was in 1843 by the French physiologist [[François Magendie]].&lt;ref name="Magendie1843"&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Magendie F  |year=1843 |title=An Elementary Treatise on Human Physiology |edition=5th |location=New York |publisher=Harper |page=150 |ref=harv |others=John Revere}} Magendie refers to phrenology as "''a pseudo-science of the present day''"&lt;/ref&gt; During the 20th century, the word was used pejoratively to describe explanations of phenomena which were claimed to be scientific, but which were not in fact supported by reliable experimental evidence.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=Still/&gt; --&gt; From time-to-time, though, the usage of the word occurred in a more formal, technical manner in response to a perceived threat to individual and institutional security in a social and cultural setting.&lt;ref name=Still&gt;{{cite journal |journal=J Theory Soc Behav |year=2004 |volume=34 |issue=3 |pages=265–90 |title=The Social Psychology of "Pseudoscience": A Brief History | vauthors = Still A, Dryden W | doi = 10.1111/j.0021-8308.2004.00248.x |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Classification ==
Philosophers classify types of [[knowledge]].  In English, the word ''[[science]]'' is used to indicate specifically the [[Natural science|natural sciences]] and related fields, which are called the [[Social science|social sciences]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2017/entries/pseudo-science/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|last=Hansson|first=Sven Ove|date=2017|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Summer 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Different philosophers of science may disagree on the exact limits – for example, is mathematics a [[formal science]] that is closer to the empirical ones, or is pure mathematics closer to the philosophical study of [[logic]] and therefore not a science?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Philosophy of Science: From Problem to Theory|author=Bunge, Mario Augusto|publisher=Transaction Publishers|year=1998|isbn=978-0-7658-0413-6|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; – but all agree that all of the ideas that are not scientific are non-scientific.  The large category of [[non-science]] includes all matters outside the natural and social sciences, such as the study of [[history]], [[metaphysics]], [[religion]], [[art]], and the [[humanities]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Dividing the category again, unscientific claims are a subset of the large category of non-scientific claims.  This category specifically includes all matters that are directly opposed to good science.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[Unscience|Un-science]] includes both [[Bad science (philosophy)|bad science]] (such as an error made in a good-faith attempt at learning something about the natural world) and pseudoscience.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Thus pseudoscience is a subset of un-science, and un-science, in turn, is subset of non-science.

==Relationship to science==
Pseudoscience is differentiated from science because – although it claims to be science – pseudoscience does not adhere to accepted scientific standards, such as the scientific method, falsifiability of claims, and Mertonian norms.

===Scientific method===
{{Main|Scientific method}}
[[File:The_Scientific_Method_(simple).png|thumb|The scientific method is a continuous cycle of hypothesis, prediction, testing and questioning.]]
[[File:PhrenologyPix.jpg|thumb|A typical 19th-century [[phrenology]] chart: During the 1820s, phrenologists claimed the mind was located in areas of the brain, and were attacked for doubting that mind came from the nonmaterial soul. Their idea of reading "bumps" in the skull to predict personality traits was later discredited.&lt;ref name="bowler"&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Bowler J |authorlink=Peter J. Bowler | name-list-format = vanc |title=Evolution: The History of an Idea |edition=3rd |publisher=[[University of California Press]] |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-520-23693-6 |ref=harv |page=128}}&lt;/ref&gt; Phrenology was first termed a pseudoscience in 1843 and continues to be considered so.&lt;ref name="Magendie1843"/&gt;]]

A number of basic principles are accepted by scientists as standards for determining whether a body of knowledge, method, or practice is scientific. Experimental results should be [[reproducibility|reproducible]] and [[intersubjective verifiability|verified]] by other researchers.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. {{harvp|Gauch|2003|pp=3–5 ff}}&lt;/ref&gt; These principles are intended to ensure experiments can be reproduced measurably given the same conditions, allowing further investigation to determine whether a [[hypothesis]] or [[theory]] related to given [[phenomena]] is [[validity (statistics)|valid]] and reliable. Standards require the scientific method to be applied throughout, and [[bias]] to be controlled for or eliminated through [[Randomized experiment|randomization]], fair sampling procedures, [[double blind|blinding]] of studies, and other methods. All gathered data, including the experimental or environmental conditions, are expected to be documented for scrutiny and made available for [[peer review]], allowing further experiments or studies to be conducted to confirm or falsify results. Statistical quantification of [[statistical significance|significance]], [[confidence interval|confidence]], and [[margin of error|error]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Gauch|2003|pp=191 ''ff''}}, especially Chapter 6, "Probability", and Chapter 7, "inductive Logic and Statistics"&lt;/ref&gt; are also important tools for the scientific method.

===Falsifiability===
{{Main|Falsifiability}}
During the mid-20th century, the philosopher [[Karl Popper]] emphasized the criterion of [[falsifiability]] to distinguish [[science]] from nonscience.&lt;ref name="Popper"&gt;{{cite book |last= Popper |first= Karl | name-list-format = vanc |author-link= Karl Popper |date= 1959 |title= The Logic of Scientific Discovery |isbn= 978-0-415-27844-7 |publisher= Routledge |ref= harv|title-link= The Logic of Scientific Discovery }} The German version is currently in print by Mohr Siebeck ({{ISBN|3-16-148410-X}}).&lt;/ref&gt; [[proposition|Statements]], [[hypothesis|hypotheses]], or [[theory|theories]] have falsifiability or refutability if there is the inherent possibility that they can be proven [[False (logic)|false]]. That is, if it is possible to conceive of an observation or an argument which negates them. Popper used astrology and [[psychoanalysis]] as examples of pseudoscience and Einstein's [[theory of relativity]] as an example of science. He subdivided nonscience into philosophical, mathematical, mythological, religious and metaphysical formulations on one hand, and pseudoscientific formulations on the other, though he did not provide clear criteria for the differences.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Popper|1963|pp=43–86}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example which shows the distinct need for a claim to be falsifiable was stated in [[Carl Sagan|Carl Sagan's]] publication ''[[The Demon-Haunted World]]'' when he discusses an invisible dragon that he has in his garage. The point is made that there is no physical test to refute the claim of the presence of this dragon. No matter what test you think you can devise, there is then a reason why this does not apply to the invisible dragon, so one can never prove that the initial claim is wrong. Sagan concludes; "Now, what's the difference between an invisible, incorporeal, floating dragon who spits heatless fire and no dragon at all?". He states that "your inability to invalidate my hypothesis is not at all the same thing as proving it true",&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Sagan|1994|p=171}}&lt;/ref&gt; once again explaining that even if such a claim were true, it would be outside the realm of [[science|scientific inquiry]].

===Mertonian norms===
{{Main|Mertonian norms}}
During 1942, [[Robert K. Merton]] identified a set of five "norms" which he characterized as what makes a real science. If any of the norms were violated, Merton considered the enterprise to be nonscience. These are not broadly accepted by the scientific community. His norms were:
* Originality: The tests and research done must present something new to the scientific community.
* Detachment: The scientists' reasons for practicing this science must be simply for the expansion of their knowledge. The scientists should not have personal reasons to expect certain results.
* Universality: No person should be able to more easily obtain the information of a test than another person. Social class, religion, ethnicity, or any other personal factors should not be factors in someone's ability to receive or perform a type of science.
* Skepticism: Scientific facts must not be based on faith. One should always question every case and argument and constantly check for errors or invalid claims.
* Public accessibility: Any scientific knowledge one obtains should be made available to everyone. The results of any research should be published and shared with the scientific community.&lt;ref name="Paradigms Lost"&gt;{{cite book |last=Casti |first=John L. | name-list-format = vanc |title=Paradigms lost: tackling the unanswered mysteries of modern science|year=1990 |publisher=Avon Books |location=New York |isbn=978-0-380-71165-9 |pages=51–52 |edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Refusal to acknowledge problems===
During 1978, [[Paul Thagard]] proposed that pseudoscience is primarily distinguishable from science when it is less progressive than alternative theories over a long period of time, and its proponents fail to acknowledge or address problems with the theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Thagard|1978|pp=223 ff}}&lt;/ref&gt; During 1983, [[Mario Bunge]] has suggested the categories of "belief fields" and "research fields" to help distinguish between pseudoscience and science, where the former is primarily personal and subjective and the latter involves a certain systematic method.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Bunge|1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticism of the term===
Philosophers of science such as [[Paul Feyerabend]] argued that a distinction between science and nonscience is neither possible nor desirable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |vauthors= Feyerabend P |date= 1975 |title= Against Method: Outline of an Anarchistic Theory of Knowledge |isbn= 978-0-86091-646-8 |chapter-url= http://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/philosophy/works/ge/feyerabe.htm |chapter= Table of contents and final chapter |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071212002717/http://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/philosophy/works/ge/feyerabe.htm |archivedate= 2007-12-12 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=Note|'A particularly radical reinterpretation of science comes from Paul Feyerabend, "the worst enemy of science"... Like Lakatos, Feyerabend was also a student under Popper. In an interview with Feyerabend in ''Science'', [he says] "Equal weight... should be given to competing avenues of knowledge such as astrology, acupunture, and witchcraft..."'&lt;ref name="Gauch2003"&gt;{{harvp|Gauch|2003|p=88}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Among the issues which can make the distinction difficult is variable rates of evolution among the theories and methods of science in response to new data.{{refn|name=fredb|group=Note|"We can now propose the following principle of demarcation: A theory or discipline which purports to be scientific is pseudoscientific if and only if: it has been less progressive than alternative theories over a long period of time, and faces many unsolved problems; but the community of practitioners makes little attempt to develop the theory towards solutions of the problems, shows no concern for attempts to evaluate the theory in relation to others, and is selective in considering confirmations and non confirmations."&lt;ref name="harvp|Thagard|1978|pp=227–228"&gt;{{harvp|Thagard|1978|pp=227–228}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Larry Laudan]] has suggested pseudoscience has no scientific meaning and is mostly used to describe our emotions: "If we would stand up and be counted on the side of reason, we ought to drop terms like 'pseudo-science' and 'unscientific' from our vocabulary; they are just hollow phrases which do only emotive work for us".&lt;ref name = "Laudan_1996"&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Laudan L |date=1996 |chapter= The demise of the demarcation problem | veditors = Ruse M | title = But Is It Science?: The Philosophical Question in the Creation/Evolution Controversy |pages= 337–350}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, [[Richard McNally]] states, "The term 'pseudoscience' has become little more than an inflammatory buzzword for quickly dismissing one's opponents in media sound-bites" and "When therapeutic entrepreneurs make claims on behalf of their interventions, we should not waste our time trying to determine whether their interventions qualify as pseudoscientific. Rather, we should ask them: How do you know that your intervention works? What is your evidence?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors= McNally RJ |url= http://www.srmhp.org/0202/pseudoscience.html |title= Is the pseudoscience concept useful for clinical psychology? |journal= The Scientific Review of Mental Health Practice |volume= 2 |issue= 2 |date= 2003 |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100430162007/http://www.srmhp.org/0202/pseudoscience.html |archivedate= 2010-04-30 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alternative definition===
For philosophers [[Silvio Funtowicz]] and [[Jerome R. Ravetz]] "pseudo-science may be defined as one where the uncertainty of its inputs must be suppressed, lest they render its outputs totally indeterminate". The definition, in the book ''[[Uncertainty and quality in science for policy]]'' (p.&amp;nbsp;54),&lt;ref name="PNS0"&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Funtowicz S, Ravetz J | year = 1990 | title = Uncertainty and quality in science for policy | location = Dordrecht | publisher = Kluwer Academic Publishers | title-link = Uncertainty and quality in science for policy }}&lt;/ref&gt; alludes to the loss of craft skills in handling quantitative information, and to the bad practice of achieving precision in prediction (inference) only at the expenses of ignoring uncertainty in the input which was used to formulate the prediction. This use of the term is common among practitioners of [[post-normal science]]. Understood in this way, pseudoscience can be fought using good practices to assesses uncertainty in quantitative information, such as [[NUSAP]] and – in the case of mathematical modelling – [[sensitivity auditing]].

==History==
{{main article|History of pseudoscience}}
The history of pseudoscience is the study of pseudoscientific theories over time. A pseudoscience is a set of ideas that presents itself as science, while it does not meet the criteria to be properly called such.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |quote = Pseudoscientific – pretending to be scientific, falsely represented as being scientific |chapter = Pseudoscientific |chapter-url = |title = Oxford American Dictionary |publisher = [[Oxford English Dictionary]] |ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter-url = http://skepdic.com/pseudosc.html |title = The Skeptic's Dictionary |chapter = Pseudoscience |ref = harv |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090201091026/http://www.skepdic.com/pseudosc.html |archivedate = 2009-02-01 |df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Distinguishing between proper science and pseudoscience is sometimes difficult. One proposal for demarcation between the two is the falsification criterion, attributed most notably to the philosopher [[Karl Popper]]. In the [[history of science]] and the [[history of pseudoscience]] it can be especially difficult to separate the two, because some sciences developed from pseudosciences. An example of this transformation is the science [[chemistry]], which traces its origins to pseudoscientific or [[Prescientific|pre-scientific]] study of [[alchemy]].

The vast diversity in pseudosciences further complicates the history of science. Some modern pseudosciences, such as astrology and acupuncture, originated before the scientific era. Others developed as part of an ideology, such as [[Lysenkoism]], or as a response to perceived threats to an ideology. Examples of this ideological process are [[creation science]] and [[intelligent design]], which were developed in response to the scientific theory of [[evolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Greener M | title = Taking on creationism.

{{See also|List of topics characterized as pseudoscience}}
A topic, practice, or body of knowledge might reasonably be termed pseudoscientific when it is presented as consistent with the norms of scientific research, but it demonstrably fails to meet these norms.&lt;ref name="Cover_Curd_1998"&gt;{{citation | veditors = Cover JA, Curd M |date= 1998 |title= Philosophy of Science: The Central Issues |pages= 1–82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Karl Popper stated it is insufficient to distinguish science from pseudoscience, or from [[metaphysics]] (such as the philosophical question of what [[existence]] means), by the criterion of rigorous adherence to the [[Empiricism|empirical method]], which is essentially inductive, based on observation or experimentation.&lt;ref name="Popper, Karl 1963"&gt;{{cite book |last= Popper |first= Karl |name-list-format= vanc |author-link= Karl Popper |date= 1963 |title= Conjectures and Refutations |url= http://www.paul-rosenfels.org/Popper.pdf |ref= harv |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20171013124349/http://www.paul-rosenfels.org/Popper.pdf |archivedate= 2017-10-13 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; He proposed a method to distinguish between genuine empirical, nonempirical or even pseudoempirical methods. The latter case was exemplified by astrology, which appeals to observation and experimentation. While it had astonishing [[empirical research|empirical evidence]] based on observation, on [[horoscopes]] and [[biographies]], it crucially failed to use acceptable scientific standards.&lt;ref name="Popper, Karl 1963"/&gt; Popper proposed falsifiability as an important criterion in distinguishing science from pseudoscience.

To demonstrate this point, Popper&lt;ref name="Popper, Karl 1963"/&gt; gave two cases of human behavior and typical explanations from [[Sigmund Freud]] and [[Alfred Adler]]'s theories: "that of a man who pushes a child into the water with the intention of drowning it; and that of a man who sacrifices his life in an attempt to save the child."&lt;ref name="Popper, Karl 1963"/&gt; From Freud's perspective, the first man would have suffered from [[psychological repression]], probably originating from an [[Oedipus complex]], whereas the second man had attained [[Sublimation (psychology)|sublimation]]. From Adler's perspective, the first and second man suffered from feelings of [[inferiority]] and had to prove himself, which drove him to commit the crime or, in the second case, drove him to rescue the child. Popper was not able to find any counterexamples of human behavior in which the behavior could not be explained in the terms of Adler's or Freud's theory. Popper argued&lt;ref name="Popper, Karl 1963"/&gt; it was that the observation always fitted or confirmed the theory which, rather than being its strength, was actually its weakness.

In contrast, Popper&lt;ref name="Popper, Karl 1963"/&gt; gave the example of Einstein's [[gravitational theory]], which predicted "light must be attracted by heavy bodies (such as the Sun), precisely as material bodies were attracted."&lt;ref name="Popper, Karl 1963"/&gt; Following from this, stars closer to the Sun would appear to have moved a small distance away from the Sun, and away from each other. This prediction was particularly striking to Popper because it involved considerable risk. The brightness of the Sun prevented this effect from being observed under normal circumstances, so photographs had to be taken during an eclipse and compared to photographs taken at night. Popper states, "If observation shows that the predicted effect is definitely absent, then the theory is simply refuted."&lt;ref name="Popper, Karl 1963"/&gt; Popper summed up his criterion for the scientific status of a theory as depending on its falsifiability, refutability, or [[testability]].

[[Paul R. Thagard]] used astrology as a case study to distinguish science from pseudoscience and proposed principles and criteria to delineate them.&lt;ref name="Thagard 1978 astrology"/&gt; First, astrology has not progressed in that it has not been updated nor added any explanatory power since [[Ptolemy]]. Second, it has ignored outstanding problems such as the [[Axial precession (astronomy)|precession of equinoxes]] in astronomy. Third, alternative theories of [[Personality psychology|personality]] and behavior have grown progressively to encompass explanations of phenomena which astrology statically attributes to heavenly forces. Fourth, astrologers have remained uninterested in furthering the theory to deal with outstanding problems or in critically evaluating the theory in relation to other theories. Thagard intended this criterion to be extended to areas other than astrology. He believed it would delineate as pseudoscientific such practices as [[witchcraft]] and [[pyramidology]], while leaving [[physics]], chemistry and [[biology]] in the realm of science. [[Biorhythms]], which like astrology relied uncritically on birth dates, did not meet the criterion of pseudoscience at the time because there were no alternative explanations for the same observations. The use of this criterion has the consequence that a theory can be scientific at one time and pseudoscientific at a later time.&lt;ref name="Thagard 1978 astrology"&gt;{{harvp|Thagard|1978}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Science is also distinguishable from revelation, theology, or spirituality in that it offers insight into the physical world obtained by empirical research and testing.&lt;ref name=Gould&gt;{{Cite magazine |first = Stephen Jay |last = Gould | name-list-format = vanc |url = http://www.stephenjaygould.org/library/gould_noma.html |title = Nonoverlapping magisteria |magazine = Natural History |date = March 1997 |issue= 106 |pages= 16–22 |dead-url= yes |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20170104061453/http://www.stephenjaygould.org/library/gould_noma.html |archive-date= January 4, 2017 |ref = harv

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Systems of belief that derive from divine or inspired knowledge are not considered pseudoscience if they do not claim either to be scientific or to overturn well-established science. Moreover, some specific religious claims, such as [[Studies on intercessory prayer|the power of intercessory prayer to heal the sick]], although they may be based on untestable beliefs, can be tested by the scientific method.

Some statements and common beliefs of popular science may not meet the criteria of science. "Pop" science may blur the divide between science and pseudoscience among the general public, and may also involve science fiction.&lt;ref name=Pendle&gt;{{cite web |first=George |last=Pendle | name-list-format = vanc |url=http://www.popularscience.co.uk/features/feat20.htm |title=Popular Science Feature – When Science Fiction is Science Fact |ref=harv |deadurl=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060214144307/http://www.popularscience.co.uk/features/feat20.htm |archive-date=2006-02-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, pop science is disseminated to, and can also easily emanate from, persons not accountable to scientific methodology and expert peer review.

If the claims of a given field can be tested experimentally and standards are upheld, it is not pseudoscience, however odd, astonishing, or counterintuitive the claims are. If claims made are inconsistent with existing experimental results or established theory, but the method is sound, caution should be used, since science consists of testing hypotheses which may turn out to be false. In such a case, the work may be better described as ideas that are "not yet generally accepted". ''[[Protoscience]]'' is a term sometimes used to describe a hypothesis that has not yet been tested adequately by the scientific method, but which is otherwise consistent with existing science or which, where inconsistent, offers reasonable account of the inconsistency. It may also describe the transition from a body of practical knowledge into a scientific field.&lt;ref name="Popper"/&gt;

===Indicators of the possible presence of pseudoscience===

====Use of vague, exaggerated or untestable claims====
* Assertion of scientific claims that are vague rather than precise, and that lack specific measurements&lt;ref&gt;e.g. {{harvp|Gauch|2003|pp=211 ''ff''}} (Probability, "Common Blunders")&lt;/ref&gt;
* Assertion of a claim with little or no explanatory power.&lt;ref name="Popper, Karl 1963"/&gt;
* Failure to make use of [[operational definition]]s (i.e. publicly accessible definitions of the variables, terms, or objects of interest so that persons other than the definer can measure or test them independently){{refn|group=Note|'Most terms in theoretical physics, for example, do not enjoy at least some distinct connections with observables, but not of the simple sort that would permit operational ''definitions'' in terms of these observables. [..] If a restriction in favor of operational definitions were to be followed, therefore, most of theoretical ''physics'' would have to be dismissed as meaningless pseudoscience!'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first = Paul Montgomery |last = Churchland | name-list-format = vanc |title = Matter and Consciousness: A Contemporary Introduction to the Philosophy of Mind|year = 1999 |publisher = MIT Press |url = https://books.google.com/?id=_7CBvggqOE4C&amp;pg=PA90&amp;lpg=PA90&amp;dq=%22operational+definitions.%22+pseudoscience|page = 90 |ref = harv|isbn = 9780262530743 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}} (See also: [[Reproducibility]]).
* Failure to make reasonable use of the principle of [[Occam's razor|parsimony]], i.e. failing to seek an explanation that requires the fewest possible additional assumptions when multiple viable explanations are possible (''see'': [[Occam's razor]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Gauch|2003|pp=269 ff}}, "Parsimony and Efficiency"&lt;/ref&gt;
* Use of [[obscurantist]] language, and use of apparently technical jargon in an effort to give claims the superficial trappings of science.
* Lack of boundary conditions: Most well-supported scientific theories possess well-articulated limitations under which the predicted phenomena do and do not apply.&lt;ref name="Hines1988"/&gt;
* Lack of effective [[Scientific control|controls]], such as [[placebo]] and [[double-blind]], in experimental design.
* Lack of understanding of basic and established principles of physics and engineering&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Donald E. Simanek |url=http://www.lhup.edu/~dsimanek/pseudo/scipseud.htm |title=What is science? What is pseudoscience? |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090425202814/http://www.lhup.edu/~dsimanek/pseudo/scipseud.htm |archive-date=2009-04-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Over-reliance on confirmation rather than refutation====
* Assertions that do not allow the logical possibility that they can be shown to be false by observation or physical experiment (''see also'': [[Falsifiability]]).&lt;ref name="Popper"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lakatos_1970"&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Lakatos I |date= 1970 |chapter= Falsification and the Methodology of Scientific Research Programmes | veditors = Lakatos I, Musgrave A |title= Criticism and the Growth of Knowledge |pages= 91–195}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Assertion of claims that a theory predicts something that it has not been shown to predict.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. {{harvp|Gauch|2003|pp=178 ''ff''}} (Deductive Logic, "Fallacies"), and at 211 ''ff'' (Probability, "Common Blunders")&lt;/ref&gt; Scientific claims that do not confer any predictive power are considered at best "conjectures", or at worst "pseudoscience" (e.g. ''[[Ignoratio elenchi]]'')&lt;ref&gt;''Macmillan Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' Vol 3, "Fallacies" 174 ''ff'', esp. section on "Ignoratio elenchi"&lt;/ref&gt;
* Assertion that claims which have not been proven false must therefore be true, and vice versa (''see'': [[Argument from ignorance]]).&lt;ref&gt;''Macmillan Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' Vol 3, "Fallacies" 174 ''ff'' esp. 177–178&lt;/ref&gt;
* Over-reliance on testimonial, [[anecdotal evidence]], or [[personal experience]]: This evidence may be useful for the context of discovery (i.e. hypothesis generation), but should not be used in the context of [[Theory of justification|justification]] (e.g. [[Statistical hypothesis testing]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Bunge|1983|p=381}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Presentation of data that seems to support claims while suppressing or refusing to consider data that conflict with those claims.&lt;ref name="harvp|Thagard|1978|pp=227–228"/&gt; This is an example of [[selection bias]], a distortion of evidence or data that arises from the way that the data are collected. It is sometimes referred to as the selection effect.
* Promulgating to the status of facts excessive or untested claims that have been previously published elsewhere; an accumulation of such uncritical secondary reports, which do not otherwise contribute their own empirical investigation, is called the [[Woozle effect]].&lt;ref name="Gambrill2012"&gt;
{{cite book|author=Eileen Gambrill|title=Critical Thinking in Clinical Practice: Improving the Quality of Judgments and Decisions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NsuHtwciwQwC&amp;pg=PA109|date=1 May 2012|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-470-90438-1|page=109|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Evidence of absence|Reversed burden of proof]]: science places the burden of proof on those making a claim, not on the critic. "Pseudoscientific" arguments may neglect this principle and demand that [[skeptic]]s demonstrate beyond a reasonable doubt that a claim (e.g. an assertion regarding the efficacy of a novel therapeutic technique) is false. It is essentially impossible to prove a universal negative, so this tactic incorrectly places the burden of proof on the skeptic rather than on the claimant.&lt;ref name="Lilienfeld"&gt;Lilienfeld SO (2004) ''Science and Pseudoscience in Clinical Psychology'' Guildford Press (2004) {{ISBN|1-59385-070-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Appeals to [[holism]] as opposed to [[reductionism]]: proponents of pseudoscientific claims, especially in organic medicine, alternative medicine, naturopathy and mental health, often resort to the "mantra of holism" to dismiss negative findings.&lt;ref name="Ruscio"&gt;{{harvp|Ruscio|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Lack of openness to testing by other experts====
* Evasion of peer review before publicizing results (termed "[[science by press conference]]"):&lt;ref name="Lilienfeld"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gitanjali B | title = Peer review -- process, perspectives and the path ahead | journal = Journal of Postgraduate Medicine | volume = 47 | issue = 3 | pages = 210–4 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11832629 | url = http://www.senseaboutscience.org.uk/PDF/peerReview.pdf | ref = harv | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060623193431/http://www.senseaboutscience.org.uk/PDF/PeerReview.pdf | df =  | deadurl = yes | archive-date = 2006-06-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=Note|For an opposing perspective, e.g. [http://www.uow.edu.au/arts/sts/bmartin/dissent/documents/ss/ss5.html Chapter 5 of Suppression Stories by Brian Martin] (Wollongong: Fund for Intellectual Dissent, 1997), pp. 69–83.}} Some proponents of ideas that contradict accepted scientific theories avoid subjecting their ideas to peer review, sometimes on the grounds that peer review is biased towards established paradigms, and sometimes on the grounds that assertions cannot be evaluated adequately using standard scientific methods. By remaining insulated from the peer review process, these proponents forgo the opportunity of corrective feedback from informed colleagues.&lt;ref name="Ruscio"/&gt;
* Some agencies, institutions, and publications that fund scientific research require authors to [[Data sharing (Science)|share data]] so others can evaluate a paper independently. Failure to provide adequate information for other researchers to reproduce the claims contributes to a lack of openness.&lt;ref name="Gauch_2003"&gt;{{harvp|Gauch|2003|pp=124 ff}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Appealing to the need for secrecy or proprietary knowledge when an [[independent review]] of data or methodology is requested&lt;ref name="Gauch_2003"/&gt;
* Substantive debate on the evidence by knowledgeable proponents of all viewpoints is not encouraged.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Sagan|1994|p=210}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Absence of progress====
* Failure to progress towards additional evidence of its claims.&lt;ref name="Lakatos_1970"/&gt;&lt;ref name=fredb group=Note/&gt; [[Terence Hines]] has identified astrology as a subject that has changed very little in the past two millennia.&lt;ref name="Hines1988"&gt;{{cite book |author-link= Terence Hines |last= Hines |first= Terence | name-list-format = vanc |title= Pseudoscience and the Paranormal: A Critical Examination of the Evidence |publisher= Prometheus Books |location= Buffalo, NY |date= 1988 |isbn= 978-0-87975-419-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Thagard|1978|pp=223 ''ff''}}&lt;/ref&gt; (see also: [[Scientific progress]])
* Lack of self-correction: scientific research programmes make mistakes, but they tend to reduce these errors over time.&lt;ref name="Ruscio120"&gt;{{harvp|Ruscio|2001|p=120}}&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, ideas may be regarded as pseudoscientific because they have remained unaltered despite contradictory evidence. The work ''Scientists Confront Velikovsky'' (1976) Cornell University, also delves into these features in some detail, as does the work of [[Thomas Kuhn]], e.g. ''The Structure of Scientific Revolutions'' (1962) which also discusses some of the items on the list of characteristics of pseudoscience.
* Statistical significance of supporting experimental results does not improve over time and are usually close to the cutoff for statistical significance. Normally, experimental techniques improve or the experiments are repeated, and this gives ever stronger evidence. If statistical significance does not improve, this typically shows the experiments have just been repeated until a success occurs due to chance variations.

====Personalization of issues====
* Tight social groups and [[authoritarian personality]], [[suppression of dissent]] and [[groupthink]] can enhance the adoption of beliefs that have no rational basis. In attempting to confirm their beliefs, the group tends to identify their critics as enemies.&lt;ref name="Devilly_437"&gt;{{harvp|Devilly|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Assertion of claims of a conspiracy on the part of the scientific community to suppress the results{{refn|group=Note|e.g. [http://archivefreedom.org/ archivefreedom.org], which claims that "The list of suppressed scientists even includes Nobel Laureates!"}}
* Attacking the motives or character of anyone who questions the claims (see [[ad hominem|Ad hominem fallacy]])&lt;ref name="Devilly_437"/&gt;{{refn|group=Note|e.g. [http://philosophy.lander.edu/logic/person.html Philosophy 103: Introduction to Logic Argumentum Ad Hominem].}}

====Use of misleading language====
* Creating scientific-sounding terms to persuade nonexperts to believe statements that may be false or meaningless: For example, a long-standing hoax refers to water by the rarely used formal name "[[dihydrogen monoxide hoax|dihydrogen monoxide]]" and describes it as the main constituent in most [[poison]]ous solutions to show how easily the general public can be misled.
* Using established terms in idiosyncratic ways, thereby demonstrating unfamiliarity with mainstream work in the discipline

==Explanations==
In a report Singer and Benassi (1981) wrote that pseudoscientific beliefs have their origin from at least four sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |first1= Barry |last1= Singer |first2= Victor A. |last2= Benassi | name-list-format = vanc |title= Occult beliefs: Media distortions, social uncertainty, and deficiencies of human reasoning seem to be at the basis of occult beliefs |magazine= American Scientist |volume= 69 |issue= 1 |date= January–February 1981 |pages= 49–55 |jstor= 27850247}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Common cognitive errors from personal experience.
* Erroneous sensationalistic mass media coverage.
* Sociocultural factors.
* Poor or erroneous science education.

Another American study (Eve and Dunn, 1990) supported the findings of Singer and Benassi and found pseudoscientific belief being promoted by high school life science and biology teachers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |first1= Raymond A. |last1= Eve |first2= Dana |last2= Dunn |name-list-format= vanc |title= Psychic powers, astrology &amp; creationism in the classroom?

===Psychology===
The psychology of pseudoscience attempts to explore and analyze pseudoscientific thinking by means of thorough clarification on making the distinction of what is considered scientific vs. pseudoscientific. The human proclivity for seeking confirmation rather than refutation ([[confirmation bias]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Devilly|2005|p=439}}&lt;/ref&gt; the tendency to hold comforting beliefs, and the tendency to overgeneralize have been proposed as reasons for pseudoscientific thinking. According to Beyerstein (1991), humans are prone to associations based on resemblances only, and often prone to misattribution in cause-effect thinking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Beyerstein B, Hadaway P | year = 1991 | title = On avoiding folly | url = | journal = Journal of Drug Issues | volume = 20 | issue = 4| pages = 689–700 | doi=10.1177/002204269002000418}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Michael Shermer]]'s theory of belief-dependent realism is driven by the belief that the brain is essentially a "belief engine," which scans data perceived by the senses and looks for patterns and meaning. There is also the tendency for the brain to create [[cognitive bias]]es, as a result of inferences and assumptions made without logic and based on instinct — usually resulting in patterns in cognition. These tendencies of [[Apophenia|patternicity]] and agenticity are also driven "by a meta-bias called the [[bias blind spot]], or the tendency to recognize the power of cognitive biases in other people but to be blind to their influence on our own beliefs."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Shermer |first=Michael |name-list-format=vanc |authorlink=Michael Shermer |date=July 2011 |title=Understanding the believing brain: Why science is the only way out of belief-dependent realism |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-believing-brain/ |journal=Scientific American |access-date=14 August 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160830132644/http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-believing-brain/ |archivedate=30 August 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Lindeman states that social motives (i.e., "to comprehend self and the world, to have a sense of control over outcomes, to belong, to find the world benevolent and to maintain one's self-esteem") are often "more easily" fulfilled by pseudoscience than by scientific information.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=Lindeman/&gt; --&gt; Furthermore, pseudoscientific explanations are generally not analyzed rationally, but instead experientially.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=Lindeman/&gt; --&gt; Operating within a different set of rules compared to rational thinking, experiential thinking regards an explanation as valid if the explanation is "personally functional, satisfying and sufficient", offering a description of the world that may be more personal than can be provided by science and reducing the amount of potential work involved in understanding complex events and outcomes.&lt;ref name=Lindeman&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lindeman M | title = Motivation, cognition and pseudoscience | journal = Scandinavian Journal of Psychology | volume = 39 | issue = 4 | pages = 257–65 | date = December 1998 | pmid = 9883101 | doi = 10.1111/1467-9450.00085 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This system encourages one to accept the conclusions they believe, and reject the ones they do not. Further analysis of complex pseudoscientific phenomena require System 2, which follows rules, compares objects along multiple dimensions and weighs options. These two systems have several other differences which are further discussed in the [[Dual process theory|dual-process theory]].{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} The scientific and secular systems of morality and meaning are generally unsatisfying to most people.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=Shermer/&gt; --&gt; Humans are, by nature, a forward-minded species pursuing greater avenues of happiness and satisfaction, but we are all too frequently willing to grasp at unrealistic promises of a better life.&lt;ref name=Shermer&gt;{{cite book|first1=Michael|last1=Shermer|first2=Steven J.|last2=Gould|authorlink1=Michael Shermer | name-list-format = vanc |authorlink2=Stephen Jay Gould|year=2002|title=Why People Believe Weird Things: Pseudoscience, Superstition, and Other Confusions of Our Time|publisher=Holt Paperbacks|location=New York|isbn=978-0-8050-7089-7|title-link=Why People Believe Weird Things: Pseudoscience, Superstition, and Other Confusions of Our Time}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Boundaries with science==
{{Main article|Demarcation problem}}

In the [[philosophy of science|philosophy]] and history of science, [[Imre Lakatos]] stresses the social and political importance of the demarcation problem, the normative methodological problem of distinguishing between science and pseudoscience. His distinctive historical analysis of scientific methodology based on research programmes suggests: "scientists regard the successful theoretical prediction of stunning novel facts&amp;nbsp;– such as the [[Halley's comet#Computation of orbit|return of Halley's comet]] or the [[Tests of general relativity#Deflection of light by the Sun|gravitational bending of light rays]]&amp;nbsp;– as what demarcates good scientific theories from pseudo-scientific and degenerate theories, and in spite of all scientific theories being forever confronted by 'an ocean of counterexamples'".&lt;ref name=Imre-Lakatos/&gt; Lakatos offers a "novel [[fallibilist]] analysis of the development of Newton's celestial dynamics, [his] favourite historical example of his methodology" and argues in light of this historical turn, that his account answers for certain inadequacies in those of [[Karl Popper]] and Thomas Kuhn.&lt;ref name=Imre-Lakatos/&gt; "Nonetheless, Lakatos did recognize the force of Kuhn's historical criticism of Popper&amp;nbsp;– all important theories have been surrounded by an 'ocean of anomalies', which on a falsificationist view would require the rejection of the theory outright... Lakatos sought to reconcile the [[rationalism]] of Popperian falsificationism with what seemed to be its own refutation by history".&lt;ref name="Bird2008"&gt;{{cite book | first = Alexander | last = Bird | chapter = The Historical Turn in the Philosophy of Science | title = Routledge Companion to the Philosophy of Science | editor1-first = Stathis | editor1-last = Psillos | editor2-first = Martin | editor2-last = Curd | name-list-format = vanc | location = Abingdon | publisher = Routledge | year = 2008 | pages = 9, 14 | chapter-format = pdf | chapter-url = http://eis.bris.ac.uk/~plajb/research/papers/The-Historical-Turn.pdf | ref = harv | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130601030150/http://eis.bris.ac.uk/~plajb/research/papers/The-Historical-Turn.pdf | archivedate = 2013-06-01 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Many philosophers have tried to solve the problem of demarcation in the following terms: a statement constitutes knowledge if sufficiently many people believe it sufficiently strongly. But the history of thought shows us that many people were totally committed to absurd beliefs. If the strengths of beliefs were a hallmark of knowledge, we should have to rank some tales about demons, angels, devils, and of heaven and hell as knowledge. Scientists, on the other hand, are very sceptical even of their best theories. Newton's is the most powerful theory science has yet produced, but Newton himself never believed that bodies attract each other at a distance. So no degree of commitment to beliefs makes them knowledge. Indeed, the hallmark of scientific behaviour is a certain scepticism even towards one's most cherished theories. Blind commitment to a theory is not an intellectual virtue: it is an intellectual crime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Thus a statement may be pseudoscientific even if it is eminently 'plausible' and everybody believes in it, and it may be scientifically valuable even if it is unbelievable and nobody believes in it. A theory may even be of supreme scientific value even if no one understands it, let alone believes in it.&lt;ref name=Imre-Lakatos/&gt;|Imre Lakatos|Science and Pseudoscience}}

The boundary between science and pseudoscience is disputed and difficult to determine analytically, even after more than a century of study by philosophers of science and [[scientist]]s, and despite some basic agreements on the fundamentals of the scientific method.&lt;ref name="Cover_Curd_1998"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Gauch|2003|pp=3–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Gordin | first = Michael D. | name-list-format = vanc | article = That a clear line of demarcation has separated science from pseudoscience | editor-last1 = Numbers | editor-first1 = Ronald L. | editor-last2 = Kampourakis | editor-first2 = Kostas | title = Newton's Apple and Other Myths about Science | pages = 219–225 | publisher = Harvard University Press | year = 2015 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=pWouCwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=newton's+apple+and+other+myths+about+science#v=onepage&amp;q=newton's%20apple%20and%20other%20myths%20about%20science&amp;f=false | isbn = 9780674915473 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of pseudoscience rests on an understanding that the scientific method has been misrepresented or misapplied with respect to a given theory, but many philosophers of science maintain that different kinds of methods are held as appropriate across different fields and different eras of human history. According to Lakatos, the typical descriptive unit of great scientific achievements is not an isolated hypothesis but "a powerful problem-solving machinery, which, with the help of sophisticated mathematical techniques, digests anomalies and even turns them into positive evidence."&lt;ref name=Imre-Lakatos/&gt;

{{quote|To Popper, pseudoscience uses induction to generate theories, and only performs experiments to seek to verify them. To Popper, falsifiability is what determines the scientific status of a theory. Taking a historical approach, Kuhn observed that scientists did not follow Popper's rule, and might ignore falsifying data, unless overwhelming. To Kuhn, puzzle-solving within a paradigm is science. Lakatos attempted to resolve this debate, by suggesting history shows that science occurs in research programmes, competing according to how progressive they are. The leading idea of a programme could evolve, driven by its heuristic to make predictions that can be supported by evidence. Feyerabend claimed that Lakatos was selective in his examples, and the whole history of science shows there is no universal rule of scientific method, and imposing one on the scientific community impedes progress.&lt;ref name=Newbold&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Newbold D, Roberts J | title = An analysis of the demarcation problem in science and its application to therapeutic touch theory | journal = International Journal of Nursing Practice | volume = 13 | issue = 6 | pages = 324–30 | date = December 2007 | pmid = 18021160 | doi = 10.1111/j.1440-172X.2007.00646.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;|David Newbold and Julia Roberts|"An analysis of the demarcation problem in science and its application to therapeutic touch theory" in ''International Journal of Nursing Practice'', Vol. 13}} Laudan maintained that the demarcation between science and non-science was a pseudo-problem, preferring to focus on the more general distinction between reliable and unreliable knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Laudan L |authorlink=Larry Laudan | veditors = Cohen RS, Laudan L |title=Physics, Philosophy and Psychoanalysis: Essays in Honor of Adolf Grünbaum|series=Boston Studies in the Philosophy of Science|volume=76|year=1983| publisher=D.

{{quote|[Feyerabend] regards Lakatos's view as being closet anarchism disguised as methodological rationalism. It should be noted that Feyerabend's claim was not that standard methodological rules should never be obeyed, but rather that sometimes progress is made by abandoning them. In the absence of a generally accepted rule, there is a need for alternative methods of persuasion. According to Feyerabend, Galileo employed stylistic and rhetorical techniques to convince his reader, while he also wrote in Italian rather than Latin and directed his arguments to those already temperamentally inclined to accept them.&lt;ref name="Bird2008"/&gt;|Alexander Bird|"The Historical Turn in the Philosophy of Science" in ''Routledge Companion to the Philosophy of Science''}}

==Politics, health, and education==

===Political implications===
The demarcation problem between science and pseudoscience brings up debate in the realms of science, [[philosophy]] and [[politics]].&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=Imre-Lakatos/&gt; --&gt; Imre Lakatos, for instance, points out that the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] at one point declared that [[Mendelian genetics]] was pseudoscientific and had its advocates, including well-established scientists such as [[Nikolai Vavilov]], sent to a [[Gulag]] and that the "liberal Establishment of the West" denies freedom of speech to topics it regards as pseudoscience, particularly where they run up against social mores.&lt;ref name=Imre-Lakatos&gt;{{citation |first= Imre |last= Lakatos | name-list-format = vanc |url= http://www2.lse.ac.uk/philosophy/About/lakatos/scienceAndPseudoscience.aspx |dead-url= yes |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110725130745/http://richmedia.lse.ac.uk/philosophy/2002_LakatosScienceAndPseudoscience128.mp3 |archive-date= 25 July 2011 |format= mp3 |title= Science and Pseudoscience |page= [https://web.archive.org/web/20110728012423/http://www2.lse.ac.uk/philosophy/about/lakatos/scienceAndPseudoscienceTranscript.aspx (archive of transcript)] |nopp= yes |publisher= The London School of Economics and Political Science, Dept of Philosophy, Logic and Scientific Method |date= 1973}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It becomes pseudoscientific when science cannot be separated from [[ideology]], scientists misrepresent scientific findings to promote or draw attention for publicity, when politicians, journalists and a nation's intellectual elite [[politicization of science|distort the facts of science for short-term political gain]], or when powerful individuals of the public conflate causation and cofactors by clever wordplay.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=Makgoba/&gt; --&gt; These ideas reduce the authority, value, integrity and independence of science in [[society]].&lt;ref name=Makgoba&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Makgoba MW | title = Politics, the media and science in HIV/AIDS: the peril of pseudoscience | journal = Vaccine | volume = 20 | issue = 15 | pages = 1899–904 | date = May 2002 | pmid = 11983241 | doi = 10.1016/S0264-410X(02)00063-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health and education implications===
Distinguishing science from pseudoscience has practical implications in the case of health care, expert testimony, environmental policies, and science education. Treatments with a patina of scientific authority which have not actually been subjected to actual scientific testing may be ineffective, expensive and dangerous to patients and confuse health providers, insurers, government decision makers and the public as to what treatments are appropriate. Claims advanced by pseudoscience may result in government officials and educators making bad decisions in selecting curricula.{{refn|group=Note|"From a practical point of view, the distinction is important for decision guidance in both private and public life. Since science is our most reliable source of knowledge in a wide variety of areas, we need to distinguish scientific knowledge from its look-alikes. Due to the high status of science in present-day society, attempts to exaggerate the scientific status of various claims, teachings, and products are common enough to make the demarcation issue serious.  For example, creation science may replace evolution in studies of biology."&lt;ref name="Stanford-Demarcations"&gt;{{harvp|Hansson|2008|loc= Section 1: The purpose of demarcations}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The extent to which students acquire a range of social and [[cognitive]] thinking skills related to the proper usage of science and technology determines whether they are scientifically literate.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=Hurd/&gt; --&gt; Education in the sciences encounters new dimensions with the changing landscape of [[Science, technology and society|science and technology]], a fast-changing culture and a knowledge-driven era.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=Hurd/&gt; --&gt; A reinvention of the school science curriculum is one that shapes students to contend with its changing influence on human welfare.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=Hurd/&gt; --&gt; Scientific literacy, which allows a person to distinguish science from pseudosciences such as astrology, is among the attributes that enable students to adapt to the changing world.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=Hurd/&gt; --&gt; Its characteristics are embedded in a curriculum where students are engaged in resolving problems, conducting investigations, or developing projects.&lt;ref name=Hurd&gt;{{cite journal| vauthors = Hurd PD |title=Scientific literacy: New minds for a changing world|journal=Science Education|volume=82|issue=3|pages=407–416|date=June 1998|doi=10.1002/(SICI)1098-237X(199806)82:3&lt;407::AID-SCE6&gt;3.0.CO;2-G}}{{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Friedman mentions why most scientists avoid educating about pseudoscience, including that paying undue attention to pseudoscience could dignify it.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Efthimiou|2006|p=4}}&amp;nbsp;—&amp;nbsp;Efthimiou quoting Friedman: "We could dignify pseudoscience by mentioning it at all".&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, Park emphasizes how pseudoscience can be a threat to society and considers that scientists have a responsibility to teach how to distinguish science from pseudoscience.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Efthimiou|2006|p=4}}&amp;nbsp;—&amp;nbsp;Efthimiou quoting Park: "The more serious threat is to the public, which is not often in a position to judge which claims are real and which are ''voodoo''. ... Those who are fortunate enough to have chosen science as a career have an obligation to ''inform the public about voodoo science''".&lt;/ref&gt;

Pseudosciences such as homeopathy, even if generally benign, are used by charlatans.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=Haven/&gt; --&gt; This poses a serious issue because it enables incompetent practitioners to administer health care.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=Haven/&gt; --&gt; True-believing zealots may pose a more serious threat than typical con men because of their affection to homeopathy's ideology.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=Haven/&gt; --&gt; Irrational health care is not harmless and it is careless to create patient confidence in pseudomedicine.&lt;ref name=Haven&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ncahf.org/pp/homeop.html#haven |author=The National Council Against Health Fraud |title=NCAHF Position Paper on Homeopathy |year=1994 |ref=harv

On December 8, 2016, Michael V. LeVine, writing in ''[[Business Insider]]'', pointed out the dangers posed by the ''[[Natural News]]'' website: "Snake-oil salesmen have pushed false cures since the dawn of medicine, and now websites like ''Natural News'' flood social media with dangerous anti-pharmaceutical, anti-vaccination and anti-GMO pseudoscience that puts millions at risk of contracting preventable illnesses."&lt;ref name=LeVine&gt;{{Citation |last=LeVine |first=Michael |name-list-format=vanc |date=December 8, 2016 |title=What scientists can teach us about fake news and disinformation |publisher=''[[Business Insider]]'' |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/scientists-fake-news-and-disinformation-pseudoscience-2016-12 |access-date=December 15, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161210131026/http://www.businessinsider.com/scientists-fake-news-and-disinformation-pseudoscience-2016-12 |archivedate=December 10, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''School of Naturalists''' or the '''School of Yin-yang''' (陰陽家/阴阳家; ''Yīnyángjiā''; ''Yin-yang-chia''; "School of Yin-Yang") was a [[Warring States]] era philosophy that synthesized the concepts of [[yin-yang]] and the [[Five elements (Chinese philosophy)|Five Elements]].

==Overview==
[[Zou Yan]] is considered the founder of this school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/607826/Zou-Yan|title=Zou Yan|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=1 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; His theory attempted to explain the universe in terms of basic forces in nature: the complementary agents of yin (dark, cold, female, negative) and yang (light, hot, male, positive) and the Five Elements or Five Phases (water, fire, wood, metal, and earth). In its early days, this theory was most strongly associated with the states of [[Yan (state)|Yan]] and [[Qi (state)|Qi]]. In later periods, these epistemological theories came to hold significance in both philosophy and popular belief.  This school was absorbed into the [[Chinese alchemy|alchemic]] and magical dimensions of [[Taoism]] as well as into the [[Traditional Chinese medicine|Chinese medical framework]]. The earliest surviving recordings of this are in the [[Mawangdui Silk Texts|Ma Wang Dui]] texts and [[Huang Di Nei Jing]].

==Figures==
[[Zou Yan]] ({{zh|t=鄒衍}}; 305{{snd}}240 BC) was an ancient Chinese philosopher best known as the representative thinker of the [[Yin and Yang]] School (or School of Naturalists) during the [[Hundred Schools of Thought]] era in [[Chinese philosophy]]. Zou Yan was a noted scholar of the [[Jixia Academy]] in the state of [[Qi (Shandong)|Qi]]. [[Joseph Needham]], a British [[sinologist]], describes Zou as "The real founder of all Chinese scientific thought."{{cn|date=March 2018}} His teachings combined and systematized two current theories during the [[Warring States period]]: [[Yin-Yang]] and the [[Five elements (Chinese philosophy)|Five Elements/Phases]] ([[wood (classical element)|wood]], [[fire (classical element)|fire]], [[earth (classical element)|earth]], [[metal (classical element)|metal]], and [[water (classical element)|water]]).

During the Han dynasty, the concepts of the school were integrated into Confucian ideology, [[Zhang Cang]] (253-152 BCE) and [[Dong Zhongshu]] (179-104 BCE) being the chief instrumental figures behind this process.

The '''Seychelles sheath-tailed bat''' (''Coleura seychellensis'') is a [[sac-winged bat]] found in the central [[granitic Seychelles|granitic islands]] of the [[Seychelles]]. It is an insectivorous bat, feeding primarily in forest clearings at night and roosting in communal roosts by day. Although previously abundant across the island group, it now only occurs on three islands. Its numbers have been declining to such an extent that the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] has listed it as being [[critically endangered]]. Increases in the cultivation of coconut palms in plantations, and the introduction of alien plant species, seem to have reduced the availability of insect food.

==Ecology==
The weight of Seychelles sheath-tailed bats averages about {{convert|10|-|11|g}}. Bats in this genus generally roost in caves and houses, in crevices and cracks. In the 1860s, the Seychelles sheath-tailed bat was reported to fly around clumps of bamboo towards twilight, and in the daytime to be found roosting in the clefts of the mountainside facing the sea and with a more or less northern aspect. These hiding places were generally covered over with the large fronds of endemic palms. The Seychelles sheath-tailed bat is insectivorous. Its colonies are apparently divided into harem groups.

It has been the focus of recent intensive research, which has determined that it is a species associated with small clearings in forest where it feeds on a wide variety of insect species. Observations of coastal or marsh feeding are thought to be bats that have been forced into feeding in unusual situations due to habitat deterioration. Although the species is not a specialist and has a high reproductive potential, it is very vulnerable to disturbance and requires several roost sites within healthy habitat.

==Status==
It was probably abundant throughout the Seychelles in the past, but it has declined drastically and is now extinct on most islands. The [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] lists this bat as being [[critically endangered]].&lt;ref name=iucn/&gt; In 2013, [[Bat Conservation International]] listed this species as one of the 35 species of its worldwide priority list of conservation.&lt;ref name="2014 report"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.batcon.org/images/stories/annualreports/AnnualReport2014.pdf |title=Annual Report 2013-2014 |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=August 2014 |website=batcon.org |publisher=Bat Conservation International |access-date=May 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is one of the most endangered animals, fewer than 100 are believed to exist in the world. The Seychelles sheath-tailed bat has suffered from habitat deterioration due to the effects of cultivation of coconut plantations and the introduction of the [[kudzu vine]], both of which have reduced the incidence of scrub and the availability of insect prey.&lt;ref name=iucn/&gt; The largest surviving roost is on [[Silhouette Island]], although small roosts do exist in [[Mahé, Seychelles|Mahé]] and also [[Praslin]] and [[La Digue]] islands.&lt;ref name=iucn/&gt; Its lifespan is 20 years; its length is {{convert|55|-|65|mm|abbr=on}}.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} It finds its mates by fighting with another male bat in front of the females.

== Career and research ==
Silver is a professor of ecosystem ecology at [[University of California, Berkeley]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/18/magazine/dirt-save-earth-carbon-farming-climate-change.html|title=Can Dirt Save the Earth?|last=Velasquez-Manoff|first=Moises|access-date=2018-11-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; With a focus on ecosystem ecology and biogeochemistry, her research is often aimed at better understanding the soil system to mitigate the effects of climate change.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A significant portion of her work has focused on tropical ecosystems, their soils, plants,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=nEbQAtyUJt8C&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA1&amp;ots=I0jHcDX3tZ&amp;sig=w8AKtMI4r6ua00T5EpYFW3n_uek#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false%20https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00996995|title=Physiological Ecology of Tropical Plants|last=Lüttge|first=Ulrich|date=2007-12-14|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=9783540717935|language=en|doi=10.1007/bf00996995}}&lt;/ref&gt; and how nutrients and carbon cycle through them. 

Silver is the lead scientist at the [[Marin Carbon Project]], which she helped found in 2008. The Marin Carbon Project uses science to improve land management, to think about the whole system and thus consider and value ecosystem services such as soil's C sequestration ability,  and make farm and ranch management more centered around n carbon-sequestration.Through this project she is working with ranchers, using compost for carbon sequestration on ranch land in California, greatly improving the soil's ability to sequester carbon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.berkeley.edu/2015/09/29/to-the-rescue-berkeley-names-faculty-climate-action-champion/|title=To the rescue: Berkeley names Faculty Climate Action Champion|date=2015-09-29|work=Berkeley News|access-date=2018-11-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/18/magazine/dirt-save-earth-carbon-farming-climate-change.html|title=Can Dirt Save the Earth?|last=Velasquez-Manoff|first=Moises|access-date=2018-11-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://grist.org/climate-energy/just-add-compost-how-to-turn-your-grassland-ranch-into-a-carbon-sink/|title=Just add compost: How to turn your grassland ranch into a carbon sink|date=2014-01-16|work=Grist|access-date=2018-11-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;
