The '''2017 Macron e-mail leaks''' were [[news leak|leaks]] of more than 20,000 [[e-mails]] related to the campaign of [[Emmanuel Macron]] during the [[French presidential election, 2017|2017 French presidential elections]], two days before the final vote. The leaks garnered an abundance of media attention due to how quickly news of the leak spread throughout the [[Internet]], aided in large part by [[Internet bots|bots]] and [[spamming|spammers]]&lt;ref name="CNBC 2017"&gt;{{cite web | author=CNBC | title=US far-right activists, WikiLeaks and Twitter bots help amplify Macron email leaks, researchers say | website=CNBC | date=7 May 2017 | url=https://www.cnbc.com/2017/05/07/macron-email-leaks-far-right-wikileaks-twitter-bots.html | access-date=12 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and drew accusations that the government of [[Russia]] under [[Vladimir Putin]] was responsible. The e-mails were shared by [[WikiLeaks]] and several American [[alt-right]] activists&lt;ref name="Scottz 2017"&gt;{{cite web | last=Scott | first=Mark | title=U.S. Far-Right Activists Promote Hacking Attack Against Macron | website=The New York Times | date=6 May 2017 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/06/world/europe/emmanuel-macron-hack-french-election-marine-le-pen.html | access-date=12 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; through social media sites like [[Twitter]], [[Facebook]], and [[4chan]].&lt;ref name="Brandom 2017"&gt;{{cite web | last=Brandom | first=Russell | title=Emails leaked in 'massive hacking attack' on French presidential campaign | website=The Verge | date=5 May 2017 | url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/5/15564532/macron-email-leak-russia-hacking-campaign-4chan | access-date=12 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally posted on a filesharing site called [[Pastebin.com|PasteBin]], the e-mails had little to no effect on the final vote as they were dumped just hours before a 44-hour [[media blackout]] that is legally required by French electoral law.&lt;ref name="Almasy 2017"&gt;{{cite web | last=Almasy | first=Steve | title=France: Emmanuel Macron's presidential campaign hacked | website=CNN | date=6 May 2017 | url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/05/05/europe/france-election-macron-hack-allegation/index.html | access-date=12 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pastebin 2017"&gt;{{cite web | title=Emmanuel Macron Leaks | website=Pastebin | date=4 May 2017 | url=https://pastebin.com/gLpwpU2U | access-date=12 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The campaign said the e-mails had been "fraudulently obtained" and that false documents were mingled with genuine ones in order "to create confusion and misinformation."&lt;ref name="Press 2017"&gt;{{cite web | last=Press | first=Associated | title=French watchdog: Macron data mixed in with fake news in leak | website=Fox News | date=6 May 2017 | url=http://www.foxnews.com/world/2017/05/06/french-watchdog-macron-data-mixed-in-with-fake-news-in-leak.html | access-date=12 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Library 2017"&gt;{{cite web | last=Library | first=CNN | title=Emmanuel Macron Fast Facts | website=CNN | date=21 May 2017 | url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/05/21/europe/emmanuel-macron-fast-facts/index.html | access-date=12 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Numerama, an online publication focusing on digital life, described the leaked material as "utterly mundane", consisting of "the contents of a [[hard drive]] and several emails of co-workers and [[La République En Marche!|En Marche]] political officials."&lt;ref name="D dies in D 2017"&gt;{{cite web | title=Macron's emails got hacked.

Nonetheless, the Russian government denied all allegations of [[foreign electoral intervention]].&lt;ref name="BBC News 2017"&gt;{{cite web | title=Macron blasts 'massive' hacking attack | website=BBC News | date=6 May 2017 | url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-39827244 | access-date=12 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[File:Marine Le Pen and Vladimir Putin (2017-03-24) 01.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Marine Le Pen with [[Vladimir Putin]] in 2017.]]
After the first round of the [[French presidential election, 2017|2017 French presidential election]] produced no majority winner, the top two candidates proceeded to a [[Two-round system|runoff election]] to be held on 7 May of that year. [[Emmanuel Macron]] of the [[La République En Marche!|En Marche!]] party and [[Marine Le Pen]] of the [[National Front (France)|National Front]] both began campaigning across [[France]] on their competing points of view.&lt;ref name="Clarke Holder 2015"&gt;{{cite web | last=Clarke | first=Seán | last2=Holder | first2=Josh | title=French presidential election: first round results in charts and maps | website=the Guardian | date=24 June 2015 | url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2017/apr/23/french-presidential-election-results-2017-latest | access-date=12 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The election was characterized by widespread dissatisfaction with the administration of [[François Hollande|President François Hollande]] and the French governmental establishment as a whole.&lt;ref name="Beauchamp 2017"&gt;{{cite web | last=Beauchamp | first=Zack | title=The French election, explained in 9 maps and charts | website=Vox | date=25 April 2017 | url=https://www.vox.com/world/2017/4/25/15409924/french-election-charts | access-date=12 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The election was widely regarded as a [[referendum]] between the [[Internationalism (politics)|internationalist]] [[centrism]] of Macron and the [[populism|populist]] [[Far-right politics|far-right]] ideology of Le Pen. After a slew of events considered to be detrimental to [[globalization]] and a triumph of [[nationalism]] and [[isolationism]], such as the [[Brexit referendum]], and the [[United States presidential election, 2016|election of Donald Trump]], many international observers viewed the French election as another possible trendsetting event for [[Western world|Western]] politics.&lt;ref name="Horobin Kostov 2017"&gt;{{cite web | last=Horobin | first=William | last2=Kostov | first2=Nick | title=Macron and Le Pen Face Off in French Election Pitting Vision of Globalization Against Nationalism | website=WSJ | date=7 May 2017 | url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/macron-and-le-pen-face-off-in-french-election-pitting-vision-of-globalization-against-nationalism-1494136806 | access-date=12 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Le Pen's [[Opposition to immigration|anti-immigration]], anti-[[NATO]], and [[Euroscepticism|anti-European Union]] stances attracted her the widespread support of far-right politicians and activists as far as the [[United States]], like [[Donald Trump]], and raised questions about possible [[appeasement]] of [[Russia]].&lt;ref name="DW.COM 2017"&gt;{{cite web | title=Le Pen blasts EU, NATO, praises Trump - News - 24.02.2017 | website=DW.COM | date=24 February 2017 | url=http://www.dw.com/en/le-pen-blasts-eu-nato-praises-trump/a-37696454 | access-date=12 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russian arms of state propaganda such as [[Russia Today]] and [[Sputnik News]] consistently portrayed Le Pen in a positive light, and her campaign had even secured millions of [[Euro]]s from a Russian lender in 2014.&lt;ref name="Ferris-Rotman 2017"&gt;{{cite web | last=Ferris-Rotman | first=Amie | title=Russia ♥ Marine Le Pen | website=POLITICO | date=17 February 2017 | url=https://www.politico.eu/article/russia-%e2%99%a5-marine-le-pen-national-front-vladimir-putin-kremlin-france-elections/ | access-date=12 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United States]], Le Pen was praised by [[Donald J. Trump|President Donald Trump]] on several occasions,&lt;ref name="Quigley 2017"&gt;{{cite web | last=Quigley | first=Aidan | title=Trump expresses support for French candidate Le Pen | website=POLITICO | date=21 April 2017 | url=https://www.politico.com/story/2017/04/21/trump-supports-marine-le-pen-237464 | access-date=12 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Obeidallah 2017"&gt;{{cite web | last=Obeidallah | first=Dean | title=Why Putin and Trump both like Le Pen | website=CNN | date=23 April 2017 | url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/04/23/opinions/trump-support-le-pen-opinion-obeidallah/index.html | access-date=12 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and she saw widespread support and praise by large numbers of online conservative [[Internet trolls|trolls]] and [[Internet]] [[alt-right]] activists on [[social media]] platforms like [[Twitter]], [[Facebook]], [[Reddit]], and [[4chan]], who simultaneously attacked Macron.&lt;ref name="Scott 2017"&gt;{{cite web | last=Scott | first=Mark | title=In French Elections, Alt-Right Messages and Memes Don't Translate | website=The New York Times | date=1 May 2017 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/04/technology/french-elections-alt-right-fake-news-le-pen-macron.html | access-date=12 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
These trolls used spamming of [[Internet meme]]s and [[misinformation]] as tactics to assail Macron; accusing him of being a "[[Globalism|globalist]] puppet" and a supporter of [[Islam]]ic immigration.&lt;ref&gt;Inside Marine Le Pen's "Foreign Legion" of American Alt-Right Trolls https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/05/marine-le-pen-alt-right-american-trolls/&lt;/ref&gt; This was not a new strategy, it had been executed to much success during the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 United States presidential election]]. Legions of pro-Trump Internet users and bots had spammed social media and rapidly spread anti-Clinton news releases and leaks across the web as was the case with the [[2016 Democratic National Committee email leak|Democratic National Committee leaks]] and the [[Podesta emails|John Podesta e-mail leaks]], allegedly with aid from the [[Moscow Kremlin|Kremlin]].&lt;ref name="Washington Post 2017"&gt;{{cite web | title=Kremlin trolls burned across the Internet as Washington debated options | website=Washington Post | date=23 December 2017 | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/kremlin-trolls-burned-across-the-internet-as-washington-debated-options/2017/12/23/e7b9dc92-e403-11e7-ab50-621fe0588340_story.html | access-date=12 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Daily Beast 2017"&gt;{{cite web | title=Russia Turns WikiLeaks CIA Dump Into Disinformation | website=The Daily Beast | date=8 March 2017 | url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2017/03/08/who-s-behind-the-massive-cia-leak | access-date=12 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Shane 2017"&gt;{{cite web | last=Shane | first=Scott | title=The Fake Americans Russia Created to Influence the Election | website=The New York Times | date=7 September 2017 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/07/us/politics/russia-facebook-twitter-election.html | access-date=12 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russian-bots-still-interfering-in-u-s-politics-after-election-expert|title=Russian bots still interfering in U.S. politics after election, says expert witness|last=Watson|first=Kathryn|date=30 March 2017|publisher=[[CBS News]] |accessdate=20 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the election, American national security officials warned the French government of the high probability of Russian digital meddling in the election, according to the [[Director of the National Security Agency]], [[Michael S. Rogers|Mike Rogers]].&lt;ref name="Matishak 2017"&gt;{{cite web | last=Matishak | first=Martin | title=NSA chief: U.S. warned France about Russian hacks before Macron leak | website=POLITICO | date=9 May 2017 | url=https://www.politico.com/story/2017/05/09/us-warned-france-russia-hacking-238152 | access-date=12 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==E-mail leaks==

On Friday 5 May 2017, two days before the scheduled vote in the presidential election, the campaign of [[Emmanuel Macron]] claimed that it had been the target of a "massive hack". At the same time at least 9 [[gigabytes]] of data were dumped on an anonymous file sharing site called [[Pastebin]] using a profile called 'EMLEAKS'.&lt;ref name="EMLEAKS 2017"&gt;{{cite web | last=Editorial | first=Reuters | title=French candidate Macron claims massive hack as emails leaked | website=U.S. | date=6 May 2017 | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-france-election-macron-leaks/macron-campaign-emails-appear-to-be-leaked-online-idUSKBN1812AZ | access-date=12 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The drop was made just hours before an [[election silence|election media blackout]] was due to take place in advance of Sunday's elections, as legally mandated under French electoral law which prevented Macron from issuing an effective response but also limited media coverage of the hack and subsequent leak.&lt;ref name="EMLEAKS 2017" /&gt;&lt;ref name="France 24 2017"&gt;{{cite web | title=French media rules prohibit election coverage over weekend | website=France 24 | date=6 May 2017 | url=http://www.france24.com/en/20170506-france-media-rules-prohibit-election-coverage-over-weekend-presidential-poll | access-date=12 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The e-mails, totaling 21,075, along with other data was quickly posted to the anonymous message board, [[4chan]], where it was shared by [[alt-right]] activists, notably [[Jack Posobiec]], on Twitter.&lt;ref name="The New Yorker 2017"&gt;{{cite web | title=The Far-Right American Nationalist Who Tweeted #MacronLeaks | website=The New Yorker | date=7 May 2017 | url=https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-far-right-american-nationalist-who-tweeted-macronleaks | access-date=12 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The e-mail leak spread swiftly under the [[hashtag]] [[hashtag|#]]MacronLeaks on Twitter and Facebook. Within three and a half hours of first being used, #MacronLeaks had reached 47,000 tweets. On Jack Posobiec's [[Twitter]], the hashtag was retweeted 87 times within five minutes, likely pointing to the use of bots. [[WikiLeaks]] mentioned the leaks in subsequent tweets 15 times, contributing the most to the news' spread. Within a short period of time, #MacronLeaks was trending in France and was on a banner on the [[Drudge Report]] homepage. In another sign of bot use the ten most active accounts using the #MacronLeaks hashtag posted over 1,300 tweets in just over three hours. One particular account, posted 294 tweets in a span of two hours. Analysis shows that the hashtag was mentioned more times by American accounts than French ones, but posts concerning them were, by a slim margin, written more often in [[French language|French]] than [[English language|English]].&lt;ref name="@DFRLab 2017"&gt;{{cite web | author=@DFRLab | title=Hashtag Campaign: #MacronLeaks – DFRLab – Medium | website=Medium | date=5 May 2017 | url=https://medium.com/dfrlab/hashtag-campaign-macronleaks-4a3fb870c4e8 | access-date=12 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The New Yorker 2017" /&gt;

The leaked e-mails were claimed to show evidence of criminal wrongdoing by Macron and his campaign including the committing of [[tax evasion]] and [[election fraud]], though these claims have not been substantiated and are likely false.&lt;ref name="WIRED 2017"&gt;{{cite web | title=Hacked Macron Emails Leak Online Ahead of French Presidential Runoff Election | website=WIRED | date=5 May 2017 | url=https://www.wired.com/2017/05/macron-email-hack-french-election/ | access-date=12 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A less suggestive examination of the e-mails by [[Numerama]], a French online publication focusing on technological news, described the leaked emails as "utterly mundane", consisting of "the contents of a hard drive and several emails of co-workers and En Marche political officials." Leaked documents included "memos, bills, loans for amounts that are hardly over-the-top, recommendations and other reservations, amidst, of course, exchanges that are strictly personal and private — personal notes on the rain and sunshine, a confirmation email for the publishing of a book, reservation of a table for friends, etc."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Julien Cadot|title=#MacronLeaks : à 24h du vote, des opposants au candidat En Marche jouent leurs dernières cartes|url=http://www.numerama.com/politique/255850-macronleaks-a-24h-du-vote-des-opposants-au-candidat-en-marche-jouent-leurs-dernieres-cartes.html|publisher=Numerama|date=5 May 2017|accessdate=7 May 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170506180719/http://www.numerama.com/politique/255850-macronleaks-a-24h-du-vote-des-opposants-au-candidat-en-marche-jouent-leurs-dernieres-cartes.html|archivedate= 6 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reaction===

In response to the attack, [[Emmanuel Macron]] said it was "democratic [[destabilisation]], like that seen during the last presidential campaign in the United States" and said the hackers had mixed falsified documents with genuine ones, "in order to sow doubt and [[disinformation]]."&lt;ref name="AFP 2018"&gt;{{cite web | author=AFP | title=Macron says hacked documents have been mixed with false ones to 'sow doubt and disinformation' | website=TheJournal.ie | date=12 January 2018 | url=http://www.thejournal.ie/macron-emmanuel-hacking-documents-french-election-3376197-May2017/ | access-date=12 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vice President of the National Front [[Florian Philippot]] and Le Pen adviser said in a tweet, "Will [[hashtag|#]]MacronLeaks teach us something that [[investigative journalism]] has deliberately killed?"&lt;ref name="Trending 2017"&gt;{{cite web | last=Trending | first=BBC | title=Macron Leaks: the anatomy of a hack | website=BBC News | date=9 May 2017 | url=https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-39845105 | access-date=12 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The French election commission warned media in the country that publishing the e-mails or discussing them so close to the election would be a violation of the law and issued a statement that in part read, "On the eve of the most important election for our institutions, the commission calls on everyone present on internet sites and [[social media|social networks]], primarily the media, but also all citizens, to show responsibility and not to pass on this content, so as not to distort the sincerity of the [[ballot]]." &lt;ref name="Savransky 2017"&gt;{{cite web | last=Savransky | first=Rebecca | title=France warns publishing candidate's hacked emails may 'distort' election | website=TheHill | date=6 May 2017 | url=http://thehill.com/homenews/news/332204-france-warns-against-publishing-candidates-hacked-emails | access-date=12 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The leak did not appear to have any impact on the French presidential election which continued as scheduled and ended with a Macron victory by a margin of 32%.&lt;ref name="Chrisafis 2017"&gt;{{cite web | last=Chrisafis | first=Angelique | title=Emmanuel Macron vows unity after winning French presidential election | website=the Guardian | date=8 May 2017 | url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/may/07/emmanuel-macron-wins-french-presidency-marine-le-pen | access-date=12 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, French security officials commenced an investigation into the hacking shortly after the election.&lt;ref name="CYBERDETECTIVE"&gt;{{cite web | last=Editorial | first=Reuters | title=French prosecutors investigate hacking of Macron campaign | website=U.S. | date=9 May 2017 | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-france-election-cyber/french-prosecutors-investigate-hacking-of-macron-campaign-idUSKBN18525X | access-date=12 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United States]], U.S. Senator from [[Virginia]] and ranking member of the [[Senate Intelligence Committee]], [[Mark Warner]] said the hacking and subsequent leak only emboldened his committee's investigation, and former [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] and Democratic presidential candidate [[Hillary Clinton]] said in a tweet, "Victory for Macron, for France, the EU, &amp; the world. Defeat to those interfering w/democracy. (But the media says I can't talk about that)."&lt;ref name="Twitter 2018"&gt;{{cite web | title=Hillary Clinton on Twitter | website=Twitter | date=2 January 2018 | url=https://twitter.com/HillaryClinton/status/861317789537193988 | language=la | access-date=12 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An assessment by Flashpoint, an American [[Computer security|cybersecurity]] firm, stated that they determined with "moderate confidence" that the group behind the hacking and leak was [[APT28]], better known as 'Fancy Bear', a hacking group with ties to [[Main Intelligence Directorate|Russian military intelligence]].

[https://books.google.com/books?id=UBavSQq-2tEC&amp;pg=PA549&amp;dq=%22Arabs+For+Israel%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=YSkrTJHXAsH_lgei1ImqBA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Arabs%20For%20Israel%22&amp;f=false A Diary of Four Years of Terrorism and Anti-Semitism], 2005. pg. 549. {{ISBN|0-595-79301-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Darwish maintains there are Muslims in America who speak out against terrorism and are pro-Israel, who are shunned by the organized Muslim community and cannot speak in mosques.&lt;ref name="Acorn"/&gt;

When asked why she started ''Arabs for Israel'', she said "to support Israel doesn't mean being anti-Arab. I love my people, but for peace to happen, we need a big leap, a new attitude; forgiveness and compassion." Darwish further said that she is afraid Israel will give away too much territory, making the country too small to defend. She concluded that "My Arab people are beautiful people, and I pray to God that they will find forgiveness in their hearts."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=GILBERT |first=LELA|title=An 'infidel' in Israel|url=http://www.jpost.com/Home/Article.aspx?id=79372|accessdate=27 June 2010|newspaper=[[Jerusalem Post]]|date=2010-02-25 &lt;!--16:54--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The positions of ''Arabs For Israel'' include the acceptance for the existence of the State of Israel, a legitimate state that is not a threat but an asset in the [[Middle East]]. The group further states that "Every major World religion has a center of gravity. Islam has [[Mecca]], and [[Judaism]] has [[Jerusalem]]." The group says it is not "Anti-Islam, Anti-Arab, confrontational or hateful."

'''''As Farpas''''' (''The Barbs'') was a monthly publication started by the authors and journalists [[Ramalho Ortigão]] and [[Eça de Queirós]]. It first appeared in 1871, when the authors were, respectively, 35 and 26, and was published in [[Portugal]] until the end of 1882. Subtitled "The Country and Portuguese Society", the monthly issues presented a caricature of the society of the time and are considered an important contribution to Portuguese literature and the launching of critical journalism in the country.&lt;ref name="Luso"&gt;{{cite web|title=As Farpas|url=https://www.luso-livros.net/Livro/farpas/|website=Luso Livros|accessdate=13 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== History ==
''As Farpas'' was initiated in the same year in which the so-called [[:pt: Conferências do Casino|Casino Conferences]] were held in Lisbon. At these conferences a group of young writers and intellectuals presented their suggestions to revolutionize Portuguese literature and cultural society of the time, based on the [[Realism (arts)| realist]] and [[Naturalism (literature)|naturalist]] philosophies of the French writer, [[Gustave Flaubert]] and others. It was the censorship imposed by the authorities on the conferences that is considered to have motivated, in large part, the authors to publish ''As Farpas''.&lt;ref name="Luso"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Passei"&gt;{{cite web|title=As farpas, de Eça de Queirós e Ramalho Ortigão|url=https://www.passeiweb.com/estudos/livros/as_farpas|website=Passei Web|accessdate=13 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The magazine was published monthly, beginning in May 1871. At an early stage Eça left the publication to pursue a diplomatic career in [[Havana]], leaving responsibility with Ramalho, who continued with it until 1882. Articles in ''As Farpas'' were initially highly critical and ironic. They satirized the partisan journalism of the press; the economic, cultural, social and moral aspects of the so-called [[Regeneration (Portugal)| Regeneration period]] in the country; religion and the Catholic faith; the segregation of the social role of women; and [[Romanticism|romantic literature]]. For Portugal, ''As Farpas'' represented a new and innovative concept of journalism, one of ideas and social and cultural criticism. They provided an excellent sociological observation of day-to-day life in Portugal. For example, observations were made of markets and prisons and in administration offices. The authors observed fishermen at work and at home, families in church, people at the theatre and journalists in the newsrooms. Articles considered adultery, clerical life, economic decay, and political and cultural degradation, themes that would later be developed in the novels of Eça de Queirós.&lt;ref name="Luso"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Passei"/&gt;  

However, Eça's opinion about this work was not very positive. He said that they were “a collection of aged pimps that are not worth the paper on which they are printed” and described them as just a “huge laugh”. After his departure, the magazine under Ramalho Ortigão took on more of a pedagogical and moralizing tone, lacking the biting caricature provided by Eça de Queirós.&lt;ref name="Luso"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Passei"/&gt;  

From 1887 to 1890 the articles by Ramalho were reprinted in eleven volumes. The texts written by Eça were assembled in two volumes in 1890 with the title ''Uma Campanha Alegre'' (''A Cheerful Campaign'').

The '''Black Native Party''' ({{lang-es|Partido Autóctono Negro}}, abbreviated '''PAN''') was a [[political party]] in [[Uruguay]] seeking to defend the rights of the [[Afro-Uruguayan]] community. The founders of the party were Afro-Uruguayan intellectuals whom sought to develop the party as a platform to elect Afro-Uruguayans to Congress.&lt;ref name="u"&gt;UNHCR. ''[https://archive.is/20130416005302/http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/country,,MRGI,,URY,,49749c853c,0.html World Directory of Minorities and Indigenous Peoples - Uruguay : Afro-Uruguayans]''&lt;/ref&gt; The party was founded in 1936 and was close to the ''Nuestra Raza'' group.&lt;ref name="p"/&gt; The foundation of PAN followed the establishment of two other Black political parties in Latin America, in Cuba (1908) and Brazil (1931).&lt;ref name="p"/&gt;

==Founding==
A first reference of the project to launch a Black political party can be found in the October 24, 1935, issue of ''Nuestra Raza''. The following issues of the journal carried more editorials and articles arguing for the foundation of the party. On May 9, 1936, a preliminary assembly of the party was held. Some 30 people participated in the event. Two preparatory bodies were named, a Reporting Committee and a Provisional Board. On May 23, 1936, the manifesto of the party (drafted by the Reporting Committee) was adopted at a party meeting.&lt;ref name="u50"&gt;Gascue, Alvaro. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=fiDSEbKGSPMC&amp;pg=PA50 Un intento de organización política de la raza negra en Uruguay - Partido Autóctono Negro]'', pp. 50–53.&lt;/ref&gt; The manifesto of the party was formulated along [[Popular Front]] lines, calling for struggle against [[fascism]] and [[imperialism]].&lt;ref name="p"&gt;Andrews, George Reid.

Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 2010, pp. 103–105.&lt;/ref&gt;

Salvador Betervide was the founding chairman of the party.&lt;ref name="p2"/&gt; Other founders included Ventura Barrios and Elemo Cabral.&lt;ref&gt;[[Carole Boyce Davies|Boyce Davies, Carole]]. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=mb6SDKfWftYC&amp;pg=PA935 Encyclopedia of the African Diaspora: Origins, Experiences, and Culture]''. Santa Barbara, Calif: ABC-CLIO, 2008, p. 935.&lt;/ref&gt; After Betervide's death from [[tuberculosis]] in 1936 the chairmanship of the party was taken over by Mario Méndez.&lt;ref name="p2"&gt;Andrews, George Reid. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=EgyrwvOaXMgC&amp;pg=PA201&amp;lpg=PA96 Blackness in the white nation: a history of Afro-Uruguay]''. Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 2010. pp. 96–97, 201&lt;/ref&gt; On January 5, 1937, the party was recognized by the Electoral Court. In March 1937 a new manifesto was issued, following similar lines as the original party manifesto.&lt;ref name="u50"/&gt;

==Local committees==
On July 5, 1937, a local committee of the party was established in [[Rivera]]. On December 4, 1937, a General Assembly of the party was organized. On December 18, 1937, a local committee was set up in the town of [[Melo, Uruguay|Melo]].&lt;ref name="u50"/&gt;

==''Pan''==
The party published the journal ''Pan'' ('Bread') as its organ. The first issue was published on April 15, 1937. Nine issues were published until December 1937.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, Marvin A. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=PMVm-e6MyxEC&amp;pg=PA159 Afro-Uruguayan Literature: Post-Colonial Perspectives]''. Lewisburg, [Pa.]: Bucknell University Press, 2003, pp. 28, 159.&lt;/ref&gt; Sandalio del Puerto was the editor of ''Pan'', until being replaced by Carmelo Gentile in October 1937.&lt;ref name="u50"/&gt;

==Electoral debacle==
On March 5, 1938, the party convention was opened. The convention was a public event. The majority of the 22 participants came from Montevideo. The convention was chaired by Victoriano Rivero, Isabelino José Gares and Félix Tejera. At the meeting a draft candidate list for the upcoming elections was presented. On the second day of the convention (March 7), 16 people participated. The candidate list was approved with Mario Méndez as the top candidate. Other candidates were Carmelo Gentile, Pilar Barrios, Rufino Silva Gonzalez, Juan Carlos Martinez, Rolando R. Olivera, Victoriano Rivero, Cándido Guimaraes, Sandalio del Puerto and Roberto Sosa.&lt;ref name="u50"/&gt;

The party failed to win major support as the majority of Afro-Uruguayans preferred to vote for either of the two main parties.&lt;ref name="u"/&gt; The party launched a list of ten candidates ahead of the [[Uruguayan general election, 1938|1938 general election]]. The election campaign, carried out in Montevideo, centered around racial discrimination in employment in the state administration. The campaign had meager results, though, receiving a mere 87 votes. Following this humiliating experience, the party never contested elections again.&lt;ref name="p"/&gt;

==Split==
PAN suffered a split in 1941. A group of Executive Committee members met on August 13, 1941, and voted to demote Méndez from his post as party chairman. Effectively two groups emerged that claimed to be the legitimate PAN, the group led by Méndez and another led by Anibal Eduarte, Ignacio Suarez Peña (chairman) and Ismael Arribio. I. Bello served as general secretary of the Méndez faction. On August 15, 1941, Méndez reported to police that properties at the PAN office had been stolen by the Suarez Peña faction. The Suarez Peña group responded by appealing to the Electoral Court that they be recognized as the genuine PAN. The Suarez Peña faction held a party assembly on August 23, 1941. The declaration of the assembly was signed by 49 persons.&lt;ref name="u50"/&gt;

In January 1942 the Méndez faction adopted a party hymn, composed by Victor Irrazabal and Carlos Tarama.&lt;ref name="u50"/&gt;

On January 23, 1942, the Electoral Court declared that it would not take sides in the dispute in PAN, arguing that it was not possible to determine who was the legitimate claimant to the name PAN.&lt;ref name="u50"/&gt;

==Reunification and dissolution==
Méndez died on June 5, 1942. Following his death the two factions were reunited in October 1942.&lt;ref name="u50"/&gt;

The party was dissolved on June 11, 1944. The few properties of the party were donated to ''Nuestra Raza''.&lt;ref name="u50"/&gt;

The '''Broadmoor Sirens''' are a series of thirteen warning sirens based in towns and villages surrounding [[Broadmoor Hospital]] in [[Crowthorne]], [[Berkshire]], England. They were first installed in 1952 and are based on [[air raid sirens]] with the intention of warning residents living near the [[Psychiatric hospital#Secure units|high-security psychiatric hospital]] of an escaped patient.&lt;ref name=mail&gt;{{cite web|last=Hudson |first=Christopher |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1088801/Broadmoor-hospital-finally-gives-secrets.html |title=Broadmoor hospital finally gives up its secrets |work=Daily Mail |date=2008-12-10 |accessdate=2015-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The Broadmoor Sirens were installed in 1952 in response to [[John Straffen|a patient]] escaping from Broadmoor and murdering a child in [[Farley Hill, Berkshire]] before being recaptured. They are similar to air-raid sirens but employ shutters to produce an alternating "high - low" warning tone.&lt;ref name=star&gt;{{cite web|last=Lyons |first=Rick |url=http://www.dailystar.co.uk/news/latest-news/305181/Fears-for-kids-as-prison-sirens-axed |title=Fears for kids as prison sirens axed |work=Daily Star |date=2013-03-24 |accessdate=2015-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; More sirens were added in the 1960s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Slevin |first=Jennie |url=http://www.getreading.co.uk/news/councillors-hear-plans-future-broadmoor-7237837 |title=Councillors hear plans for future of Broadmoor sirens |publisher=Get Reading |date=2014-06-09 |accessdate=2015-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; after discussions in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] raised  the issue that the sirens' {{convert|2|mi|adj=on|spell=in}} radius was insufficient for nearby towns such as [[Camberley]] and [[Wokingham]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1960/feb/22/broadmoor-institution#column_25 |title=Broadmoor Institution (Hansard, 22 February 1960) |work=Hansard |date= |accessdate=2015-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The thirteen sirens, labelled A–M to distinguish each unit, were created with the intention of warning residents in surrounding towns and villages to remain in their homes and keep their children supervised following the escape of a Broadmoor patient. The sirens are activated as a test at 10am every Monday to ensure they are working.&lt;ref name=mail /&gt; The sirens are susceptible to electrical interference. In 2014, the Bracknell siren was activated accidentally during an electrical storm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bracknellnews.co.uk/news/roundup/articles/2014/07/18/102073-update-trust-apologises-after-three-hour-fault-with-broadmoor-siren-in-the-early-hours-of-this-morning/ |title=UPDATE: Trust apologises after three hour fault with Broadmoor siren in the early hours of this morning |work=Bracknell News |date=2014-07-18 |accessdate=2015-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The thirteen satellite sirens are due to be decommissioned during 2018, with one siren remaining in the hospital grounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wlmht.nhs.uk/bm/broadmoor-hospital/the-broadmoor-siren/ |title=The Broadmoor Siren |work=West London Mental Health, 6 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Future ==
The last time the Broadmoor Sirens were activated because of an escape was in 1991, although they were activated in 1993 because of an attack at the hospital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/dna/place-lancashire/A7414292 |title=The Broadmoor Siren |publisher=BBC |date=2007-11-19 |accessdate=2015-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, there were plans to remove seven of the thirteen sirens. This was because Broadmoor had added a second security fence around the hospital and intended to upgrade the remainder of the sirens so they had a {{convert|5|mi|adj=on|spell=in}} radius to improve on the two-mile radius of the 1952 sirens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-berkshire-28251712 |title=Plan to scrap Broadmoor Hospital satellite sirens |publisher=BBC News |date=2014-07-11 |accessdate=2015-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Local residents objected to this on safety grounds due to there being sixteen [[primary schools]] within the radius of the sirens.&lt;ref name=star /&gt;
It was reported on June 2, 2016 that the hospital plans to have twelve (possibly all thirteen) sirens scrapped by 2018 in favor of escape alerts via the [[internet]] and [[Twitter]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/06/02/broadmoors-plans-to-replace-warning-sirens-with-twitter-alerts-n/&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is possible that Siren G, the siren nearest to the hospital, will remain in operation, though it will most likely be scrapped as well and replaced by a newer siren.

The term '''business oligarch'''&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jul/09/oleg-deripaska-michael-cherney-high-court Gun battles and 'extortion' in latest Russian oligarch legal battle], The Guardian, July 9, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|reason=No mention of 'business oligarch'|date=April 2018}}  is almost a synonym of the term [[business magnate]],{{cn|date=April 2018}} borrowed by the English-speaking and western media from [[Russian language|post-Soviet]] parlance to label those [[businessmen]] who quickly acquired huge wealth in [[post-Soviet states]] (mostly [[Russia]] and [[Ukraine]]) during the [[privatization in Russia]] and in other post-Soviet states in the 1990s. Post-Soviet oligarchs are magnates who controls sufficient resources to influence national politics &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Guriev |first1= Sergei |last2= Rachinsky |first2= Andrei |title= The role of oligarchs in Russian capitalism |journal= Journal of Economic Perspectives |date=2005|pages=131-150|doi= 10.1257/0895330053147994|url= https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/0895330053147994 |volume=19|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Chern2018&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Chernenko|first1= Demid |title= Capital structure and oligarch ownership |journal= Economic Change and Restructuring |date=2018|pages=1–29|doi= 10.1007/S10644-018-9226-9|url= https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10644-018-9226-9 |volume=|issue= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Business group might be defined as an oligarch if it satisfies the following conditions:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
(1) owners are the largest private owners in the country 
(2) it possesses sufficient political power to promote its own interests
(3) owners control multiple businesses, which intensively coordinate their activities.&lt;ref name=Chern2018&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A typical example of a post-Soviet oligarch entity is the [[Privat Group]] - a large [[Ukraine]]-based transnational business conglomerate comprising dozens of industrial companies in several markets, controlled by only three stakeholders, and not through the [[stock exchange]]. For the history of business oligarchs in post-Soviet Union states see:

* [[Russian oligarch]]s
* [[Ukrainian oligarchs]]

More generally, an '''oligarch''' is a "member of an [[oligarchy]]; a person who is part of a small group holding power in a state".&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite OED | oligarch}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
Aristotle gave the concept of oligarchy some negative connotations, but the term does not necessarily imply wealth.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web
| url= http://global.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/427558/oligarchy
| title= Oligarchy
| publisher= Encyclopædia Britannica| date= June 20, 2013
| quote= Oligarchy, government by the few, especially despotic power exercised by a small and privileged group for corrupt or selfish purposes. [...] Aristotle used the term oligarchia to designate the rule of the few when it was exercised not by the best but by bad men unjustly. In this sense, oligarchy is a debased form of aristocracy, which denotes government by the few in which power is vested in the best individuals. Most classic oligarchies have resulted when governing elites were recruited exclusively from a ruling caste [...].

'''Calcium peroxide''' or '''calcium dioxide''' is the [[inorganic compound]] with the formula CaO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. It is the [[peroxide]] (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&amp;minus;&lt;/sup&gt;) salt of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;. Commercial samples can be yellowish, but the pure compound is white.  It is almost insoluble in [[water]].&lt;ref name = Ullmann&gt;{{Ullmann | title = Peroxo Compounds, Inorganic | author =  Harald Jakob, Stefan Leininger, Thomas Lehmann, Sylvia Jacobi, Sven Gutewort | doi = 10.1002/14356007.a19_177.pub2}}&lt;/ref&gt;   

==Structure and stability==
As a solid, it is relatively stable against decomposition.   In contact with water however it hydrolyzes with release of oxygen.  Upon treatment with [[acid]], it forms [[hydrogen peroxide]].

==Preparation==
Calcium peroxide is produced by combining [[calcium]] salts and [[hydrogen peroxide]]:
:Ca(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  +  H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;   →   CaO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  +  2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O
The octahydrate precipitates upon the reaction of [[calcium hydroxide]] with dilute [[hydrogen peroxide]].  Upon heating it dehydrates.

==Applications==
It is mainly used as an oxidant to enhance the extraction of precious metals from their ores.  In its second main application, it is used as a [[food additive]] under the [[E number]] E930 it is used as [[flour bleaching agent]] and [[improving agent]].&lt;ref name = Ullmann/&gt;

In agriculture it is used in the presowing treatments of [[rice seed]]. Also, calcium peroxide has found use in the [[aquaculture]] to oxygenate and disinfect water.  In the ecological restoration industry it is used in the treatment of soils. Calcium peroxide is used in a similar manner to [[magnesium peroxide]] for environmental restoration programs.  It is used to restore soil and groundwater contaminated with petroleum by the process of enhanced in-situ [[bioremediation]].

The '''Castle Hill rebellion''' of 1804 was a [[rebellion]] by [[Convictism in Australia|convicts]] against colonial authority of the [[British Empire|British colony]] of [[Colony of New South Wales|New South Wales]] in the [[Castle Hill, New South Wales|Castle Hill]] area, in [[Sydney]]. The rebellion culminated in a battle fought between convicts and the [[colonial forces of Australia]] on 5 March 1804 at [[Rouse Hill, New South Wales|Rouse Hill]], dubbed the '''Second Battle of Vinegar Hill''' after the first [[Battle of Vinegar Hill]] which had taken place in 1798 in [[Ireland]]. It was the first and only major convict uprising in [[History of Australia|Australian history]] suppressed under [[martial law]].

On 4 March 1804, according to the official accounts 233 convicts led by Philip Cunningham (a veteran of the [[Irish Rebellion of 1798]], as well as [[mutiny]] on the convict transport ship [[Anne (1799 ship)|''Anne'']]) escaped from a prison farm intent on "capturing ships to sail to Ireland". In response, martial law was quickly declared in the Colony of New South Wales. The mostly Irish rebels, having gathered reinforcements, were hunted by the colonial forces until they were sequestered on 5 March 1804 on a hillock nicknamed Vinegar Hill. Under a [[White flag|flag of truce]], Cunningham was arrested and troops charged and the rebellion was crushed by a [[Raid (military)|raid]]. Nine of the rebel leaders were executed and hundreds were punished before martial law was finally revoked a week after the battle.{{TOC limit|2}}

==Background==

Many convicts in the [[Castle Hill, New South Wales|Castle Hill]] area had been involved in the 1798 rebellions in Ireland and subsequently transported as exiles-without-trial to the Colony of New South Wales from late 1799. Phillip Cunningham, a veteran of the 1798 rebellion, and William Johnston, another Irish convict at Castle Hill, planned an uprising in which over 685 convicts at Castle Hill intended to meet with nearly 1,100 convicts from the [[Hawkesbury River]] area, rally at [[Constitution Hill, New South Wales|Constitution Hill]], and march on [[Parramatta, New South Wales|Parramatta]] and then [[Sydney]] (Port Jackson) itself.&lt;ref name=myplace/&gt; According to Helen Mackay, their goal was to establish Irish rule in the colony and obtain ships for those that wanted to return to Ireland to help revive the failed [[Irish Rebellion of 1803]].&lt;ref name=Mackay125&gt;Mackay 2016, p. 125.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=whitaker&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dictionaryofsydney.org/entry/castle_hill_convict_rebellion_1804 |title=Castle Hill convict rebellion 1804 |author=Whitaker, Anne-Maree |work=[[Dictionary of Sydney]] |year=2009 |accessdate=3 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the evening of 4 March 1804, John Cavenah set fire to his hut at Castle Hill at 8:00  as the signal for the rebellion to begin. While this fire was not seen by the convicts at Green Hills, today's Windsor, on the Hawkesbury River, Cunningham activated the plan to gather weapons, ammunition, food and recruits from local supporters and the government farm at Castle Hill.&lt;ref&gt;Silver 1989, p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt; With Cunningham leading, about 200 to 300 rebels broke into the Government Farm's buildings, taking firearms, ammunition, and other weapons.&lt;ref name="Coulthard2"/&gt; The constables and overseers were overpowered and the rebels then went from farm to farm on their way to Constitution Hill at Parramatta, seizing more weapons and supplies including rum and spirits, and recruiting others to join their cause.&lt;ref&gt;Silver 1989, pp. 82–86.&lt;/ref&gt; Their move had been informed from the intelligence gathered a year previous when 12 convicts de-camped from Castle Hill scouring the surrounding districts seeking out friends and sympathisers. On capture each and every one had the same story – they were heading to China by crossing over the [[Blue Mountains (New South Wales)|Blue Mountains]].&lt;ref name=Mackay125/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;According to Silver (p. 62), due to limited geographical knowledge, at the time many Irish convicts believed that China lay just beyond the Blue Mountains and that they could escape their incarceration by making their way over the mountains.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Initial government response===
[[File:Castle hill irish rebellion of 1804 australia.jpg|thumb|240px|[[Castle Hill, New South Wales|Castle Hill]] Irish rebellion.]]
When news of the uprising spread there was great panic amongst the colony of around 5,000 inhabitants with officials such as [[Samuel Marsden]] fleeing the area by boat, escorting [[Elizabeth Macarthur]] and her children, as an informer had advised that an attack would be made on the farm to draw troops away from Parramatta.&lt;ref&gt;Silver 1989, pp. 87–88.&lt;/ref&gt; In Sydney, following news from Parramatta, Governor [[Philip Gidley King|Philip King]] set off alone for Parramatta to assume command, while Lieutenant Colonel [[William Paterson (explorer)|William Paterson]], the lieutenant governor, called out the guard. One hundred and forty men from [[HMS Calcutta (1795)|HMS ''Calcutta'']], as well as the Sydney Loyal Association militia, took over guard duties, and a [[New South Wales Corps]] contingent of  56 personnel including Lieutenant William Davies&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.historyaustralia.org.au/ifhaa/bios/davis.htm |title= William Davis |author=Brown, Scott |work=IFHAA Biographies Library |accessdate=5 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Quartermaster Sergeant Thomas Laycock were dispatched to march through the night to bolster the garrison at Parramatta. Meanwhile, the provost marshal, Thomas Smyth, was sent ahead to contact Major [[George Johnston (British Marines officer)|George Johnston]] at Annandale. The troops from Sydney arrived at 1:30 am, and after a quick inspection an advanced guard was sent to the west of the town.&lt;ref&gt;Silver 1989, pp. 90&amp;ndash;91.&lt;/ref&gt; Johnston arrived at Government House in Parramatta about four hours later not long after  King had declared martial law under the Mansfield doctrine of [[posse comitatus]].&lt;ref&gt;In 1780, a series of riots in London were eventually suppressed by the use of soldiers. In discussing the legal ramifications of this action Parliament agreed with Lord Chief Justice Mansfield who declared that all civil riots should be put down by civil authorities and the posse comitatus, never by military authorities. Further that even if soldiers comprise the posse comitatus they are deemed to be acting in a civil capacity and are thus subject to civilian laws. This policy of soldier as civilian came to be known as the Mansfield Doctrine and was to be the controlling policy on the role of the posse comitatus in England.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Silver 1989, pp. 94 &amp; 106.&lt;/ref&gt;

King's proclamation of martial law applied to a wide area extending from Castle Hill to the Hawkesbury and Nepean areas, and empowered citizens in the area to detain those who lacked the appropriate passes. A curfew had also been enacted and an amnesty declared, which gave those who were involved 24 hours to surrender. On Johnston's arrival at Parramatta, King delivered his orders, in writing, to Johnston and then verbally to his small detachment. Johnston was to proceed to the western gate of the park around Government House, where the rebels had been seen a few hours earlier. If they were not there, he was ordered to exploit towards [[Toongabbie]] and Castle Hill to locate them and then await further orders. He was also empowered to fire upon anyone who did not obey his directions.&lt;ref&gt;Silver 1989, pp. 94–95.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after 5:00 am, Johnston set out to locate the main rebel force. In addition to the troops he had brought with him, a number of civilians volunteered along with the 36 armed members of the Parramatta [[Loyal Association]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lancers.org.au/site/The_Military_at_Parramatta.asp |title=The Military at Parramatta: A Talk Given to the Parramatta and District Historical Society on 19 September 1962  |author=Vernon, P |publisher= Royal New South Wales Lancers Lancer Barracks and Museum |accessdate=2 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; militia were also called out and took over defence of the town. Over 50 enrolled in a reserve militia combined with the NSW Corps to march out and confront the rebels.&lt;ref&gt;Silver 1989, pp. 97 &amp; 103.&lt;/ref&gt; Johnston decided to advance in two columns, one which he led himself towards Toongabbie, and another under a subaltern, Davies, which was sent along the Castle Hill Road.&lt;ref name="Silver 1989, p. 96"&gt;Silver 1989, p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rebels prepare ===

Meanwhile, the rebels at Constitution Hill ([[Toongabbie]]) were having difficulties co-ordinating their force as several parties, including one of around 70 men under Samuel Humes, had lost their way in the night. Nevertheless, Cunningham and William Johnston commenced drilling their men,&lt;ref&gt;Silver 1989, p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt; while a party unsuccessfully tried to enter Parramatta,&lt;ref&gt;Some accounts state that about 30 rebels were killed or wounded in fighting with government forces around the western gate. See Mackay 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; where they were to set fire to a building to signal other conspirators to begin converging on Constitution Hill.&lt;ref&gt;Silver 1989, pp. 88–90.&lt;/ref&gt; Cunningham, being involved in two previous rebellions and the [[Ann (ship)|mutiny on the ''Anne'']], knew from experience that the most important element of a rebellion or uprising would be secrecy. However, there were two defections: an Irish convict overseer named Sloane, and Lewis Bulger.&lt;ref&gt;Silver 1989, pp. 77–79.&lt;/ref&gt; The commandant at Parramatta, Captain Edward Abbott, who had warning of the rebellion as it was happening, commenced defensive measures and sent a message to the governor in Sydney.&lt;ref&gt;Silver 1989, p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:George Johnston.jpg |thumb|right|George Johnston, who led the military response to the rebellion, as a lieutenant colonel in 1810.]]

With their courier, John Griffen, having had second thoughts about passing on the instructions Cunningham had given him to pass on to Brian Furey and subsequently being arrested,&lt;ref&gt;Silver 1989, pp. 77–80.&lt;/ref&gt; the call out messages to [[Windsor, New South Wales|Windsor]], Parramatta and Sydney failed, and the uprising was confined to west of the Parramatta area. After fruitlessly waiting for a signal of a successful internal takeover of Parramatta, and the non-appearance of reinforcements, Cunningham was forced to withdraw from Parramatta to Toongabbie to re-assess his strategy.&lt;ref name="Silver 1989, p. 96"/&gt; Having already declared his hand, and deprived of both surprise and facing a superior and well disciplined force of [[Red coat (British army)|Red Coats]] and enthusiastic militia, the uprising under Cunningham had no recourse but to withdraw west towards the Hawkesbury hoping to pick up more recruits and meeting his missing forces on the way to add to his forces.&lt;ref name=Coulthard2&gt;Coulthard-Clark 1998, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Knowing that going forward would only see more death and possible routing, they quickly moved westward hoping to join up with those now heading east from Green Hills (Windsor) to meet in the area of today's [[Rouse Hill, New South Wales|Rouse Hill]] and [[Kellyville, New South Wales|Kellyville]], recruiting or impressing against their will a number of convicts along the way. (Those later giving evidence stated they were press-ganged into service&lt;ref&gt;Silver 1989, p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt; in hope of lessening their punishment.) During this phase they obtained around a third of the entire colony's armaments.&lt;ref name=Silver86&gt;Silver 1989, p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt; Their numbers had dwindled to several hundred, eventually reaching a total of 233.&lt;ref name=Silver103/&gt; During the short period of the rebellion, Cunningham was elected "King of the Australian Empire", and his followers declared the area "New Ireland".&lt;ref name=myplace&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.myplace.edu.au/decades_timeline/1800/decade_landing_20.html?tabRank=2&amp;subTabRank=4|title=Australia in the 1800s: Castle Hill Rebellion|work=My Place: For Teachers|publisher=Australian Children's Television Foundation and Education Services Australia|accessdate=3 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Battle ==

Major Johnston's contingent, wearied by their night march, needed time to close with the retreating rebels, who were reported to number around 400, so he rode after them with a small mounted party to implement delaying tactics, while the rest of his party completed the {{convert|4|mi|km}} march to Toongabbie. Initially, it was believed that the rebels were at Toongabbie, but on arrival Johnston was informed that they had moved on to Constitution Hill. A small party under a corporal was sent to outflank this position, while an assault force of around a dozen men advanced on the summit, only to find it abandoned, with the rebels having moved off towards the Hawkesbury, about {{convert|17|mi|km}} away. As the morning progressed, the heat of the day threatened to stymie the efforts of the marching troops who were poorly equipped for the pursuit.&lt;ref&gt;Silver 1989, p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, about {{convert|6|mi|km}} from Toongabbie,&lt;ref&gt;Silver 1989, p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt; Johnston located the main rebel party of around 230 to 260 men near Rouse Hill,&lt;ref name=Coulthard3&gt;Coulthard-Clark 1998, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Johnston first sent his mounted trooper on to call the rebels to surrender and take the benefit of the Governor's amnesty for early surrender. This failing, he dispatched Roman Catholic priest Father James Dixon to appeal to them. Next he rode up himself, appealing to them, then got their agreement to hear Father Dixon again.&lt;ref&gt;Silver 1989, pp. 100–101.&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, the pursuing forces had closed up and Major Johnston with Trooper Analzark came again to parley, calling down the leaders Cunningham and Johnston from the hill. Demanding their surrender, he received the response "Death or Liberty" from Cunningham,&lt;ref&gt;Silver 1989, p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt; to which some were reported to have added "and a ship to take us home".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nma.gov.au/online_features/defining_moments/featured/castle_hill_rebellion |title=Castle Hill Rebellion |work=Defining Moments in Australian History |publisher=National Museum Australia |accessdate=2 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the [[NSW Corps]] and militia now formed up in firing lines behind him Major Johnston and Analzark produced pistols duping, while under truce, the two leaders of the uprising, and escorting them back to the Red Coat's lines. Quartermaster Sergeant Thomas Laycock, on being given the order to engage, directed over fifteen minutes of musket fire, then charged cutting Cunningham down with his cutlass. The now leaderless rebels first tried to fire back, but then broke and dispersed.&lt;ref&gt;Silver 1989, pp. 102–104.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the battle (at least) fifteen rebels had fallen, according to the official reports, Major Johnston prevented further bloodshed and killings by threatening his troops with his pistol tempering their enthusiasm.&lt;ref&gt;Silver 1989, pp. 103–105.&lt;/ref&gt; Several convicts were captured and others killed in the pursuit which went up to Windsor all day until late in the night, with new arrivals of soldiers from Sydney joining in the search for rebels. On Wednesday, 7 March Governor King announced that those that surrendered before 10 March would receive leniency and following this large parties who lost their way in the night turned themselves in under the amnesty or made their way back to Castle Hill where a large party of about 70 under Samuel Humes were captured by a detachment of the Loyal Parramatta Association.&lt;ref&gt;Silver 1989, pp. 106–108.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aftermath ==
According to the official records of the day, around 230 were eventually brought in over next few days and of the convicts directly engaged in the battle, 15 were killed, and 9 including the ringleaders Cunningham and Johnston were executed,&lt;ref name=BOVHWho&gt;{{cite web|year=2004 |url=http://www.battleofvinegarhill.com.au/whofought.htm |title=Who fought at the Battle of Vinegar Hill |work=The Battle of Vinegar Hill |publisher=www.battleofvinegarhill.com.au |accessdate=19 July 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060813184804/http://www.battleofvinegarhill.com.au/whofought.htm |archivedate=13 August 2006 |df=dmy }} Derived from the book ''The Battle of Vinegar Hill'' by Lynette Ramsey Silver, published by Watermark Press, updated and expanded 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;According to Silver (p. 132): Phillip Cunningham (executed at Windsor), William Johnston (executed at Castle Hill), John Neale (executed at Castle Hill), George Harrington (executed at Castle Hill), Samuel Humes (executed at Parramatta), Charles Hill (executed at Parramatta), Jonothan Place (executed at Parramatta), John Brannan (executed at Sydney), Timothy Hogan (executed at Sydney)&lt;/ref&gt; with two, Johnson and Humes, subjected to [[gibbeting]]. Two men, John Burke and Bryan McCormack, were reprieved and detained at the Governor's pleasure,  seven were whipped with 200 or 500 lashes then allotted to the [[Coal River Precinct|Coal River]] chain gang,&lt;ref&gt;According to Silver (pp. 132–133): John Griffin, Neil Smith, Bryan Burne, Connor Dwyer, David Morrison, Cornelius Lyons and Owen McDermot.&lt;/ref&gt; while 23 others, including Cavenah were sent to the [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]] coal mines.&lt;ref&gt;Silver 1989, pp. 132–133.&lt;/ref&gt; Another 34 prisoners were placed in irons until they could be "disposed of". It is not known whether some, or all of them, were sent to the Coal River.&lt;ref name=BOVHWho/&gt; Of the remaining rebels, some were put on good behaviour orders against a trip to [[Norfolk Island]], while the majority were pardoned and allowed to return to their places of employment as having been coerced into the uprising.&lt;ref name=Mackay&gt;Mackay 2016, pp. 128.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Silver 1989, p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cunningham, badly wounded but still alive, was court martialled under the martial law and hanged at the Commissariat Store at Windsor, which he had bragged he would burn down.&lt;ref name="Silver 1989, p. 106"&gt;Silver 1989, p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, military officers were intent on hanging a token number of those captured having convened a military court at the Whipping Green&lt;ref&gt;Present day Prince Alfred Square, Parramatta.&lt;/ref&gt; but this was quickly stopped by Governor Gidley King fearful of the repercussions.&lt;ref&gt;Silver 1989, pp. 108–110.&lt;/ref&gt;

Martial law was eventually lifted on 10 March 1804,&lt;ref name="Silver 1989, p. 106"/&gt; but this did not end the insurgency. Irish plots continued to develop, keeping the Government and its informers vigilant, with military call out rehearsals continuing over the next three years. Governor King remained convinced that the real inspirers of revolt had kept out of sight, and had some suspects sent to Norfolk Island as a preventive measure.&lt;ref&gt;Silver 1989, pp. 114–118.&lt;/ref&gt;

The battle site is believed to be to the east of the site of the [[Rouse Hill House|Rouse Hill Estate]], and it is likely that [[Richard Rouse (Australian colonial settler)|Richard Rouse]], a staunch establishment figure, was subsequently given his grant at this site specifically to prevent it becoming a significant site for Irish convicts. "The Government Farm at Castle Hill", a plot of land around {{convert|60|ha|acre}}, was added in March 1986 to the (now defunct) [[Register of the National Estate]], as a special place of international and Australian significance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.environment.gov.au/cgi-bin/ahdb/search.pl?mode=place_detail;search=list_code%3DRNE%3Bplace_id%3D2964%3Bkeyword_PD%3Don%3Bkeyword_SS%3Don%3Bkeyword_PH%3Don%3Blatitude_1dir%3DS%3Blongitude_1dir%3DE%3Blongitude_2dir%3DE%3Blatitude_2dir%3DS%3Bin_region%3Dpart;place_id=2964 |title=Castle Hill Settlement Site, Old Castle Hill Rd, Castle Hill, NSW, Australia  |work=Australian Heritage Database |accessdate=3 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Residential development has significantly diminished the area of the prison town. Less than {{convert|20|ha|acre}} has remained undeveloped and conserved, as Castle Hill Heritage Park, established in 2004. There is a sculpture near the battle site at Castlebrook Cemetery commemorating the sacrifice. However, there is some debate as to where the battle actually occurred.&lt;ref name="Riley"&gt;{{cite web|last=Riley |first=Cameron |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2003 |url=http://www.hawkesburyhistory.org.au/articles/Battle_of_Vinegar.html |title=The 1804 Australian Rebellion and Battle of Vinegar Hill |work=Historical Influences on the Hawkesbury |publisher=The Hawkesbury Historical Society |accessdate=19 July 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060819034722/http://hawkesburyhistory.org.au/articles/Battle_of_Vinegar.html |archivedate=19 August 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Commemoration ===
The [[Anniversary|bicentenary]] of the rebellion was commemorated in 2004, with a variety of events.&lt;ref name="BOVHProg"&gt;{{cite web | year = 2004 | url = http://www.battleofvinegarhill.com.au/program.htm | title = Program | work = The Battle of Vinegar Hill | publisher = www.battleofvinegarhill.com.au | accessdate = 19 July 2006

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The re-enactment in 2004 was significant in that exact numbers were recruited to form the rebels, the militia and the military. The event was held in close proximity to the original site on a similar landscape. The re-enactment was recorded by the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://splash.abc.net.au/web/splash#!/media/2428320/the-second-battle-of-vinegar-hill |title=The Second Battle of Vinegar Hill  |publisher=ABC Splash |accessdate=2 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://splash.abc.net.au/home#!/media/2428288/what-is-living-history- |title=What is 'living history'? |publisher=ABC Splash |accessdate=2 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the battle has been depicted on screen. An Australian 1978 TV series, ''[[Against the Wind (TV series)|Against the Wind]]'', included a dramatization over two episodes of the build-up to and ultimate defeat of the rebellion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0076974/ |title=Against the Wind (TV mini-series) |work=Internet Movie Database |accessdate=2 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A monument commemorating the battle was erected at Castlebrook Memorial Park, on Windsor Road, Rouse Hill.

DCI works to implement its mission with a number of partner organizations including Rights and Sight for Children (Bangladesh), Diabetic Association of Bangladesh (Bangladesh), Ispahani Eye Hospital (Bangladesh), Tauri Foundation (Bangladesh),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bangladesh|url=http://distressedchildren.org/where-we-work/bangladesh|website=Distressed Children &amp; Infants International|accessdate=22 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kalinga Eye Hospital and Research Centre (India),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=India|url=http://distressedchildren.org/where-we-work/india|website=Distressed Children &amp; Infants International|accessdate=22 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nepal Netra Jyoti Sangh (Nepal),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nepal|url=http://distressedchildren.org/where-we-work/nepal|website=Distressed Children &amp; Infants International|accessdate=22 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and New Haven/León Sister City Project (Nicaragua).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nicaragua|url=http://distressedchildren.org/where-we-work/nicaragua|website=Distressed Children &amp; Infants International|accessdate=22 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission==
DCI describes its mission using two phrases: "Rights and Sight for Children" - to protect [[child rights]], stop [[child labor]], and help families lift themselves out of poverty through education, healthcare, vision care, and income generating opportunities; and "Children Helping Children" - to connect American youth to less fortunate children in other countries, educating them about the challenges facing children worldwide and inspiring them to take leadership roles in humanitarian causes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Our Mission|url=http://distressedchildren.org/mission/|website=Distressed Children &amp; Infants International|accessdate=22 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Distressed Children &amp; Infants International (DCI) was founded on May 23, 2003 at [[Yale University]] by current Executive Director Dr. [[Ehsan Hoque]] and President Dr. Brian DeBroff of the [[Yale School of Medicine]]. DCI was officially recognized as a non-profit charitable organization by the United States Government and the Office of the Connecticut Secretary of the State in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Our Story|url=http://www.distressedchildren.org/story/|website=Distressed Children &amp; Infants International|accessdate=22 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programs==

===Sun Child Sponsorship Program===
DCI's Flagship "Sun Child Sponsorship" Program was inaugurated in [[Bangladesh]] in 2005 and operates in the regions of [[Patuakhali]], [[Feni District|Feni]], [[Habiganj]], [[Nilphamari]] and [[Dhaka]]. According to DCI, the program utilizes a comprehensive poverty alleviation model that focuses on individual children while bringing lasting change on a community-wide scale. The program's primary objective is to provide severely underprivileged children with the resources they need to stay in school instead of having to enter the labor force, and thereafter keeping them on track to become independent and productive citizens through educational and training opportunities. In addition, the program provides health care as well as family and community support in the form of small business development and adult education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sun Child Sponsorship Program|url=http://www.distressedchildren.org/programs/sun-child-sponsorship|website=Distressed Children &amp; Infants International|accessdate=22 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Healthcare for the Underprivileged Program===
DCI's Health for the Underprivileged Program has operated in [[Dhaka]], [[Bangladesh]] since 2008. Through a free clinic located within Kallayanpur slum, DCI provides free preventive and curative treatment, including maternal health care, to a community of approximately 9000 slum residents. The clinic operates six days per week and provides free treatment and medicine. Additionally, DCI employs social workers who visit homes to identify health needs and connect patients, especially women and children, with appropriate treatment. The workers educate women on how to better take care of their health care needs and provides information about hospital delivery of newborns. The clinic also runs awareness classes for adolescent girls with the goal of preventing child marriage and teaching female health and hygiene skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Healthcare for the Underprivileged Program|url=http://www.distressedchildren.org/programs/healthcare-for-the-underprivileged|website=Distressed Children &amp; Infants International|accessdate=22 March 2016}}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Blindness Prevention Program===
DCI's Blindness Prevention Program was launched in 2007, with the objective of preventing and treating vision loss among underprivileged children and their families. Through this program, DCI conducts free eye screening camps and awareness campaigns for the visually disabled in all of its project locations in [[Bangladesh]], as well as providing eyeglasses to correct refractive errors and arranging free cataract surgeries for children and adults. Similar efforts are also supported with partner organizations in India and [[Nepal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Blindness Prevention Program|url=http://www.distressedchildren.org/programs/blindness-prevention|website=Distressed Children &amp; Infants International|accessdate=22 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Orphan Support Program===
DCI's Orphan Support Program was established in 2010 to provide comprehensive support to orphaned children to give them the opportunity to enjoy a normal childhood and grow into well-rounded, independent and productive adult citizens. The program delivers support through DCI's own orphanage facility in [[Dhaka]], [[Bangladesh]], as well as supplemental support to local government-run orphanages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Orphan Support Program|url=http://www.distressedchildren.org/programs/orphan-support|website=Distressed Children &amp; Infants International|accessdate=22 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Journey for Child Rights &amp; Sight" and International Conference===
DCI regularly holds events throughout the United States to raise awareness about issues affecting children such as child poverty, [[child labor]], and preventable childhood blindness.

In 2006, DCI hosted its first "Conference on Child Rights &amp; Sight" at [[Yale University]]: an international conference that gathers speakers and leaders from around the world to address issues of child rights - in particular [[child labor]] - and diseases that affect vision, and discuss creative solutions. As of 2016, DCI has held five international conferences at Yale University: in 2006, 2009, 2011, and 2013, and 2015. The most recent 5th International Conference on Child Rights &amp; Sight took place at [[Yale University]] on Saturday, October 24, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=5th Conference on Child Rights &amp; Sight|url=http://www.distressedchildren.org/conference|website=Distressed Children &amp; Infants International|accessdate=22 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Cheshire Citizen - Cheshire, CT {{!}} Locally based charity continues fight for world’s children|url = http://www.cheshirecitizen.com/news/allnews/7995041-129/story.html.html|website = www.cheshirecitizen.com|accessdate = 2015-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = ePaper {{!}} The Daily Sun|url = http://www.edailysun.com/~edailysun/arc/next_page/2015-11-08/14#tab1|website = www.edailysun.com|accessdate = 2015-12-14}}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Destressed Children &amp; Infants International Conference|url = http://www.shuspectrum.com/news/2015/11/11/destressed-children-infants-international-conference|website = Sacred Heart Spectrum|accessdate = 2015-12-14|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151222093207/http://www.shuspectrum.com/news/2015/11/11/destressed-children-infants-international-conference|archivedate = 2015-12-22|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Patrons and Goodwill Ambassadors==
DCI's Patrons and Goodwill Ambassadors include Bangladeshi actress [[Babita Akhtar]] and Bangladeshi singer [[Sabina Yasmin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Our Team|url=http://www.distressedchildren.org/team/|website=Distressed Children &amp; Infants International|accessdate=22 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Financial Accountability and Transparency==
According to DCI, 91% of its funds go to program services (childcare, orphan support, blindness prevention, etc.), 6% goes to fundraising, and 3% goes to management and administration. DCI states that 100 percent of all proceeds from program contributions are used to cover the costs of DCI programs and services, with no portion being used to cover administrative or fundraising costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Transparency|url=http://www.distressedchildren.org/transparency/|website=Distressed Children &amp; Infants International|accessdate=22 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DCI claims to follow rigorous standards of accountability and transparency to maximize the benefit to underprivileged communities and provide donors with full confidence in the positive impact of their charitable giving. All tax returns of the organization are published on DCI's website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Transparency|url=http://www.distressedchildren.org/transparency/|website=Distressed Children &amp; Infants International|accessdate=22 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Folkspartei''' ({{lang-yi|ייִדישע פֿאָלקספּאַרטײַ}}, ''yidishe folkspartei'', 'Jewish People's Party, folkist party) was founded after the 1905 [[pogrom]]s in the [[Russian Empire]] by [[Simon Dubnow]] and Israel Efrojkin. The party took part in several elections in [[Poland]] and [[Lithuania]] in the 1920s and 1930s and did not survive the [[Shoah]].

==Ideology==
According to the historian [[Simon Dubnow]] (1860-1941), [[Jew]]s are a [[nation]] on the spiritual and intellectual level and should strive towards their [[National personal autonomy|national and cultural autonomy]] in the [[Jewish diaspora|diaspora]] (''galuth'') in some way a secularized and modernized version of the [[Council of Four Lands]] under the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Henry Abramson]], [http://src-h.slav.hokudai.ac.jp/sympo/02summer/pdf2/abramson_large.pdf The end of intimate insularity: new narratives of Jewish history in the post-Soviet era], in Acts of Symposium “Construction and Deconstruction of National Histories in Slavic Eurasia,” at Sapporo, Japan, on July 10–13, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; He said, "How then should Jewish autonomy assert itself? It must, of course, be in full agreement with the character of the Jewish national idea. Jewry, as a spiritual or cultural nation, cannot in the Diaspora seek territorial or political separatism, but only a social or a national-cultural autonomy."&lt;ref&gt;Koppel S. Pinson, Simon Dubnow, Nationalism and History, The Jewish Publication Society of America, Philadelphia, 1958&lt;/ref&gt;

Close to the [[General Jewish Labour Bund in Lithuania, Poland and Russia|Bund]] for the emphasis on Yiddish and its culture, it differed from that party by its middle class, craftsmen and intellectual base, but also because of its ideological options. According to Dubnov, [[Jewish assimilation|assimilation]] was not a natural phenomenon and the Jewish political struggle should be centered on a Jewish autonomy based upon community, language and education, and not upon [[class struggle]] as advocated by Bundist theorists. It was a liberal party in economic matters, committed to political democracy and secularism.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} Annette Wieviorka, [http://www.anti-rev.org/textes/Wieviorka94a/index.html "Les Juifs de Varsovie à la veille de la Seconde Guerre mondiale"], in Les Cahiers de la Shoah n° 1, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

==Folkspartei in Ukraine==
The Folkist [[Zeev Latsky|Ya'akov Ze'ev Latsky ("Bertoldi")]] (former member of the [[Zionist Socialist Workers Party]]) was appointed Minister for Jewish Affairs in the [[Ukrainian People's Republic]] in April 1918, replacing [[United Jewish Socialist Workers Party|Fareynikte]] [[Moishe Zilberfarb]]. He was succeeded by [[Abraham Revutzky]] of [[Poale Zion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Frankel|first=Jonathan|title=Prophecy and politics: socialism, nationalism, and the Russian Jews, 1862-1917|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1984|pages=686|isbn=978-0-521-26919-3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-ycwctuCSpQC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Folkspartei in Poland==

A local organization and a newspaper, ''[[Warszawer Togblat]]'' (The Warsaw Daily), was set up in [[Warsaw]] in 1916 in order to contend for the municipal elections (under German occupation), where they gained 4 seats, including [[Noach Pryłucki]], one of the founders of the party's newspaper, later renamed as 'Der Moment'. He was also elected at the [[Polish legislative election, 1919|1919 Constituent Sejm]], but had to resign for a citizenship matter. In the 1922-27 [[Polish Parliament]] (Sejm) Noach Pryłucki was the only Folkist MP out of 35 Jewish MPs (25 Zionists, but no Bundist). He was elected on the list of the [[Bloc of National Minorities]]. The party split in 1927 between the Warsaw branch, led by Pryłucki, and the Vilnius (then a part of Poland) branch, led by Dr. [[Zemach Shabad]], less hostile to Zionism than the Warsaw branch but more Yiddish-centered. After the split the party seems to have declined, with an attempt to revitalize it in Warsaw in 1935. At the 1936 [[Kehilla (modern)#The Warsaw Kehilla during the Second Polish Republic|Jewish community elections in Warsaw]], the Folkspartei only got 1 seat out of 50, while the Bund got 15.

==Folkspartei in Lithuania==

Lawyer and banker [[Shmuel Landau]] (also spelled ''Landoi''), later municipal councillor in Ponevezh&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Rosin, [http://www.shtetlinks.jewishgen.org/Panevezys/pon2.html Panevezys (Ponevezh)]&lt;/ref&gt; (Lit. [[Panevėžys]]), was elected (or rather succeeded elected MP [[Naphtali Friedman]], a nonpartisan lawyer, after his death) for the Folkspartei on a common Jewish electoral list (with the Zionist parties and [[Agudat Israel]]) at the first elected Lithuanian Parliament ([[Seimas]]) in 1920 when there were 6 Jewish parties deputies out of 112.

Vilnius (Yiddish: Vilna), where Jews formed the majority of the population, was incorporated into Poland in 1922-1939, and also sent at least one Folkist to the Polish Parliament ([[Sejm]]), [[Zemach Shabad]] (Szabad)(1864-1935).

The next elections (1922) were rigged against the Polish and Jewish minorities, but the Seimas was dissolved and another Folkist, the lawyer [[Oizer Finkelstein]] (also spelled ''Euser''), was elected in 1923 on a national minorities bloc. In [[1926 Lithuanian coup d'état|1926 a coup d'état]] took place in Lithuania and the parliament was dissolved in 1927.

The Folkist newspaper in interwar Lithuania was the 'Folksblat', published in [[Kaunas]].

'''Frank Lawrence Owsley''' (January 20, 1890 – October 21, 1956) was an [[Americans|American]] [[historian]] who taught at [[Vanderbilt University]] for most of his career, where he specialized in southern history and was a member of the [[Southern Agrarians]].  He is notorious for his racist essay "The Irrepressible Conflict" (1930) in which he lamented the economic loss of slavery for the defeated Confederacy and wrote of the "half savage blacks" that had been freed. He is also known for his study of Confederate diplomacy based on the false myth of "[[King Cotton]]" and especially his quantitative social history of the middling folk—the "plain people" of the Old South.

==Life and career==
Born in rural Alabama, he attended [[Auburn University]] for his undergraduate degree.  He earned his Ph.D. in history at the [[University of Chicago]] in 1924 under the tutelage of [[William E. Dodd]]. He taught at [[Vanderbilt University]]. Owsley specialized in Southern history, especially the [[Antebellum era|antebellum]] and [[American Civil War|Civil War]] eras.&lt;ref&gt;Burton (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Confederacy===
Owsley argued in his dissertation ''State Rights and the Confederacy'' (1925) that the Confederacy "died of states' rights". Owsley held that during the [[United States|Civil War]], key Southern governors resisted the appeals of the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate government]] for soldiers. His book '' King Cotton Diplomacy: Foreign Relations of the Confederate States of America ''(1931) is the basic study of Confederate diplomacy. It emphasizes that Southerners before the war had a profound belief in the power of [[King Cotton]] to rule the industrial economy, so that Britain and France would enter the war on behalf of the Confederacy to get that cotton. The belief was not based on knowledge of Europe and failed in practice.

===Southern Agrarians===
As an active member of the [[Southern Agrarians]] group based in [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]], Owsley contributed "The Irrepressible Conflict" to the manifesto ''I'll Take My Stand'' (1930). In this work, he described "half-savage blacks . . . some of whom could still remember the taste of human flesh and the bulk of them hardly three generations removed from cannibalism."&lt;ref&gt;Frank L. Owsley. "The Irrepressible Conflict," in ''I'll Take My Stand'' (Nashville, 1930), 62&lt;/ref&gt; He lashed out at the North for what he alleged were attempts to dominate the South spiritually and economically. In "Scottsboro, the Third Crusade: The Sequel to Abolition and Reconstruction" (the ''American Review'' [1933]: 257–85), he criticized northern race reformers as the "grandchildren of abolitionists and [[Reconstruction era of the United States|reconstructionists]]."  He announced that the South was white man's country and that blacks must accommodate that reality. Serving as president of the [[Southern Historical Association]] in 1940, Owsley castigated the North for assuming its people and thinking represented the entire nation, and for violating what he called "the comity of section".&lt;ref&gt;Burton (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;

Owsley agreed with the other [[Southern Agrarians]] of the 1930s in espousing values which they saw being overtaken by the industrialism and modernism that had begun to influence the South. According to Owsley, the position of the South vis-à-vis the North was created not by slavery, the dominance of cotton and agriculture, or [[states' rights]], but by the two regions' misunderstanding of each other.&lt;ref&gt;Walter Kirk Wood, "Before Republicanism: Frank Lawrence Owsley and the Search for Southern Identity, 1865–1965." ''Southern Studies'' (1995) 6(4): 65–77&lt;/ref&gt;

===Plain Folk of the Old South===
After 1940, Owsley and his wife Harriet pioneered what came to be called the "new social history". They studied the historical demography of the South and social mobility and produced a history called ''Plain Folk of the Old South''.  Historian Vernon Burton described it as "one of the most influential works on Southern history ever written."&lt;ref&gt;Burton (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; The Owsleys culled data from federal census returns, tax and trial records, and local government documents and wills. In ''Plain Folk'', they argued that Southern society was not dominated by planter aristocrats, but that yeoman farmers played a significant role.  The religion, language, and culture of white common people created a democratic "plain folk" society, Owsley argued.&lt;ref&gt;Burton (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;

Owsley's work ''Plain Folk of the Old South'' (1949) was an answer to liberal historians' emphasis on the dominance of the planter class' social and political control of the South. He regarded the future of American civilization as dependent on the survival of southern regionalism and agrarian values. Owsley's ''Plain Folk'' instead depicts a complex social structure in the South, one featuring a large middle class of yeoman farmers and not just wealthy planters and poor whites. He argues that the South was devoted to [[Republicanism in the United States|republican values]] generally and was not locked into race and slavery. Owsley believed the Civil War's causes were rooted in both North and South.&lt;ref&gt;Burton (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;

In rejecting the [[Lost Cause of the Confederacy]] and the New South's romantic legends, Owsley sought to uncover a "real" South, what he called the plain folk.&lt;ref&gt;Walter Kirk Wood, "The Misinterpretation of Frank L. Owsley: Thomas J. Pressly and the Myth of a Neo-confederate Revival, 1930–1962." ''Southern Studies'' (2003) 10(3–4): 39–67&lt;/ref&gt;  He characterized the postwar South as made up of a broad class of yeoman farmers, between poor blacks, many of whom were sharecroppers in a kind of debt bondage, and poor whites at one end, and large plantation owners at the opposite end of the economic spectrum.  Owsley asserted that the real South was liberal, American, and [[Jeffersonian democracy|Jeffersonian]], not radical or reactionary.

Critics suggested Owsley was a reactionary defender of the Confederacy. They said he was attempting to rewrite the past to preserve white Southern culture.&lt;ref&gt;Wood (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; They said he overemphasized the size of the Southern landholding middle class, while excluding the large class of [[Poor White|poor white southerners]] who owned neither land nor slaves.  Further, they  suggested Owsley's theory assumed too much commonality in shared economic interests united Southern farmers.  Critics believed that he did not fully assess the vast difference between the planters' commercial agriculture and the yeoman's subsistence farming.&lt;ref&gt;Hyde (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

Biographer Priscilla Roberts argues that his work on the ''Plain Folk of the Old South'':
: suggested that the South’s middle-class yeomanry, the majority of whites in that section, enjoyed a relationship of mutual respect with the gentry and planters of the region and a common commitment to the South's existing socioeconomic system which united all of them. Increasingly vitriolic abolitionist attacks on slavery by northerners during the 1850s threatened the South’s  identity and domestic independence, to the point that such "plain folk" felt that, in defending their section, they were defending the same liberties that the thirteen colonies had defended in 1776: a viewpoint with which Owsley clearly sympathized.&lt;ref&gt;Priscilla M. Roberts, "Owsley, Frank Lawrence" in {{cite book|author=Kelly Boyd, ed.|title=Encyclopedia of Historians and Historical Writing, vol. 2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0121vD9STIMC&amp;pg=PA896|year=1999|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|pages=898}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vanderbilt===
At [[Vanderbilt University]] (1920–49), Owsley directed nearly 40 Ph.D. dissertations and was a popular teacher of undergraduates. In 1949 he went to the [[University of Alabama]] to build its history program.  Reacting to attacks by critics of Southern [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregation]], Owsley tried to refute what he saw as their misunderstanding of the true South.  He regarded the future of American civilization as dependent on the survival of southern regionalism.&lt;ref&gt;Burton (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;

Owsley served as the chairman of the history department of the [[University of Alabama]], 1951-54. Afterward, he was a guest lecturer at several universities. In 1956, Owsley embarked on a journey to Europe in the Summer of 1956, on a Fulbright Scholarship, to research in British and French archives, a task which he did not live to complete.&lt;ref&gt;Owsley, Frank. King Cotton Diplomacy. University of Chicago Press. 1931 &amp; 1959. (in Memorial Forward by William C. Brinkley, Tulane University)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7423">[[Image:GS logo.png|right|thumb|Logo of the 2007 General Synod of the Anglican Church of Canada]]
The '''General Synod of the Anglican Church of Canada''' is the chief governing and legislative body of the [[Anglican Church of Canada]] (ACC), the sole Canadian representative of the [[Anglican Communion]].  The first [[General Synod]] session was held in [[Toronto]] in 1893, with the proviso that the parameters of its authority would not undermine the local independence of [[diocese]]s.

==Composition and responsibilities==
[[File:General Synod 2010 - In debate (4690840801).jpg|thumb|General Synod debate, Halifax 2010]]Except in special instances when it may be called into session by the [[Primate of the Anglican Church of Canada]] or the Council of General Synod, the General Synod meets triennially at locations across Canada.  The Synod next meets in 2016 in Toronto, Ontario.  Other recent locales for General Synod have been:

*2013:  [[Ottawa|Ottawa, Ontario]] meeting in Joint Assembly with the National Church Council of the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in Canada]]
*2010:  [[Halifax Urban Area|Halifax, Nova Scotia]]
*2007:  [[Winnipeg|Winnipeg, Manitoba]]
*2004:  [[St. Catharines, Ontario]]
*2001:  [[Waterloo, Ontario]]
*1998:  [[Montreal|Montreal, Quebec]]
*1995:  Ottawa, Ontario

The General Synod is composed of three Orders:  [[Bishop]]s, [[Clergy]], and [[Laity]].  All bishops and [[archbishop]]s of the ACC are members of General Synod; clergy and lay delegates are elected from each of the church's thirty dioceses, as well as the [[Canadian Forces]] and the religious orders.  Unlike the [[Church of England]] or the [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America]], the Orders are not divided into Houses which meet separately according to different [[rules of order]].   Nonetheless, voting may be done by Orders with respect to certain issues, or on demand according to the rules of order, under which conditions a given Resolution would need to be approved in all three.

The General Synod is responsible for articulating the [[doctrine]], discipline, and [[liturgy|worship]] of the Anglican Church of Canada.  During its regular meetings, which generally span a week to nine days, members exchange information, set policy for the church, pass resolutions, and enact and amend [[canon law]].  Presently, there are twenty-two numbered canons, dealing with issues as prosaic as the name of the church, to ones touching on doctrine, such as [[matrimony]] and [[Anglican ministry|Holy Orders]], to judicial disciplinary proceedings.

==Officers of General Synod and the Council of General Synod==
General Synod elects three of the nine officers who maintain certain executive responsibilities at and between Synods.  Of those, one - the Primate - holds office until he or she resigns, is removed, retires, or dies.  The other officers, elected at each General Synod, are the [[Prolocutor]] and the Deputy Prolocutor.

The Prolocutor acts as the chief deputy to the Primate, and the second executive officer of General Synod.  As such, he chairs sessions of General Synod and meetings of the Council of General Synod in the absence of the Primate.  The current Prolocutor is Cynthia Haines Turner; the Deputy Prolocutor is Lynne McNaughton.

===Council of General Synod===
Between sessions of General Synod, the Council of General Synod (COGS) administers the affairs of the ACC.  COGS is composed of the Primate, the Prolocutor, the Deputy Prolocutor, the Chancellor, and representatives from the three Orders from each of the four [[Ecclesiastical provinces of the Anglican Church of Canada|ecclesiastical provinces]], chosen by the respective delegates at General Synod, the numbers of which vary according to a complicated electoral formula.  COGS appoints four of the nine officers of General Synod:
* The [[General Secretary]]
* The [[Treasurer]]
* The [[Chancellor (ecclesiastical)|Chancellor]]
* The Vice-Chancellor, if appointed
It also elects two Officers-at-large (one Clergy, one Laity).

==Committees of General Synod==
General Synod has six standing committees, consisting of members both elected at General Synod and appointed by the Primate:
* Faith, Worship and Ministry Committee:  Responsible for [[liturgy|liturgical]] issues;
* Partners in Mission Committee:  Responsible for relationships with Anglican and [[ecumenism|ecumenical]] churches and organisations overseas;
* Eco-Justice Committee:  Responsible for social and environmental issues;
* Pension Committee:  Responsible for clergy and staff pension administration;
* Financial Management and Development Committee:  Responsible for the ACC's financial affairs;
* Communications and Information Resources Committee:  Responsible for the communications and publications of the ACC, including the [[Anglican Journal]] newspaper.

==Important acts of recent General Synods==
*1995: General Synod approves the publication of a new hymnal, the first since 1971.  It is published in 1998, under the title ''Common Praise''.
*2001: General Synod approves full communion with the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in Canada]], under the provisions of the [[Waterloo Declaration]].
*2004:  [[Andrew Hutchison]] is elected twelfth Primate of the Anglican Church of Canada.  Synod votes to affirm "the integrity and sanctity of committed adult same-sex relationships."
*2007:  [[Fred Hiltz]] was elected the thirteenth primate of the Anglican Church of Canada. Synod approved the "St. Michael Report", accepting that the blessing of same-sex unions is not a matter of "core doctrine" but rejected a motion that would have authorized dioceses to bless same-sex unions.  The motion was passed by the clergy and laity, but was narrowly defeated by the House of Bishops.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anglican.ca/news/news.php?newsItem=2007-06-23_tt.news Synod approves St. Michael report]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anglican.ca/news/news.php?newsItem=2007-06-24_ssb.news Blessing of same-sex unions defeated]&lt;/ref&gt; General Synod, however, approved a motion calling for "pastoral care" of same-sex couples and called on the Primate's Theological Commission to recommend changes to the Marriage Canon to permit the marriage of all couples entitled under Canadian civil law (thus including gays and lesbians).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anglican.ca/news/news.php?newsItem=2007-06-25_n.news General Synod commits to pastoral care of same-sex couples]&lt;/ref&gt;
*2016: Same-sex Marriage received approval in first reading by two thirds majority requiring a second approval in second reading at General Synod 2019&lt;ref&gt;http://www.anglicanjournal.com/articles/voting-error-reveals-anglican-same-sex-marriage-motion-passed-after-all&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main article|Backup}}

The subject of computer backups is rife with jargon and highly specialized terminology.  This page is a '''glossary of backup terms''' that aims to clarify the meaning of such jargon and terminology.

== Terms and definitions ==
'''backup policy'''
: an organisation's procedures and rules for ensuring that adequate amounts and types of backups are made, including suitably frequent testing of the process for restoring the original production system from the backup copies.
'''[[backup rotation scheme]]'''
: a method for effectively backing up data where multiple media are systematically moved from storage to usage in the backup process and back to storage.  There are several different schemes.  Each takes a different approach to balance the need for a long retention period with frequently backing up changes.  Some schemes are more complicated than others.
'''[[backup site]]'''
: a place where business can continue after a data loss event.  Such a site may have ready access to the backups or possibly even a continuously updated mirror. 
'''[[backup software]]'''
: computer software applications that are used for performing the backing up of data, i.e., the systematic generation of backup copies. See also: [[List of backup software]].
'''backup window'''
: the period of time that a system is available to perform a backup procedure.  Backup procedures can have detrimental effects to system and network performance, sometimes requiring the primary use of the system to be suspended.  These effects can be mitigated by arranging a backup window with the users or owners of the system(s).
'''copy backup'''
: backs up the selected files, but does not mark the files as backed up (reset  the archive bit). This is found in the backup with Windows 2003.
'''cumulative incremental backup'''
: a differential backup used by NetBackup.
'''daily backup'''
: incremental backup of files that have changed today
'''[[data recovery|data salvaging/recovery]]'''
: the process of recovering data from storage devices when the normal operational methods are impossible.  This process is typically performed by specialists in controlled environments with special tools.  For example, a crashed hard disk may still have data on it even though it doesn't work properly.  A data salvage specialist might be able to recover much of the original data by opening it up in a clean room and tinkering with the internal parts. 
'''[[differential backup]]'''
: a cumulative backup of all changes made since the last full backup. The advantage to this is the quicker recovery time, requiring only a full backup and the latest differential backup to restore the system.  The disadvantage is that for each day elapsed since the last full backup, more data needs to be backed up, especially if a majority of the data has been changed.
'''[[disaster recovery]]'''
: the process of recovering after a business disaster and restoring or recreating data.  One of the main purposes of creating backups is to facilitate a successful disaster recovery.  For maximum effectiveness, this process should be planned in advance and [[Disaster recovery and business continuity auditing|audited]].
'''disk cloning'''
: the process of copying the contents of one computer hard disk to another disk or to an ''image file'' (see ''disk image'' below) for later recovery.
'''[[disk image]]'''
: single file or storage device containing the complete contents and structure representing a data storage medium or device, such as a hard drive, tape drive, floppy disk, CD/DVD/BD, or USB flash drive.  
'''FlashBackup'''
: a term used for ''raw partition backup'' used by NetBackup Advanced Client.  In NBAC, support is limited to the VxFS (Veritas), ufs (Solaris), Online JFS (HP-UX), and NTFS (Windows) filesystem types.  Similar to the UNIX utility ''dump''.
'''full backup'''
: a backup of all (selected) files on the system. In contrast to a drive image, this does not included the file allocation tables, partition structure and boot sectors.
'''[[hot backup]]'''
: a backup of a database that is still running, and so changes may be made to the data while it is being backed up. Some database engines keep a record of all entries changed, including the complete new value. This can be used to resolve changes made during the backup.
'''[[incremental backup]]'''
: a backup that only contains the files that have changed since the most recent backup (either full or incremental).  The advantage of this is quicker backup times, as only changed files need to be saved.  The disadvantage is longer recovery times, as the latest full backup, and all incremental backups up to the date of data loss need to be restored.
'''media spanning'''
: sometimes a backup job is larger than a single destination storage medium.  In this case, the job must be broken up into fragments that can be distributed across multiple storage media.  
'''multiplexing'''
: the practice of combining multiple backup data streams into a single stream that can be written to a single storage device.  For example, backing up 4 PCs to a single tape drive at once.
'''multistreaming'''
: the practice of creating multiple backup data streams from a single system to multiple storage devices.  For example, backing up a single database to 4 tape drives at once.
'''normal backup'''
: full backup used by Windows Server 2003.
'''near store'''
: provisionally backing up data to a local staging backup device, possibly for later archival backup to a remote store device.
'''open file backup'''
: the ability to back up a file while it is in use by another application.  See [[File locking]].
'''remote store'''
: backing up data to an offsite permanent backup facility, either directly from the live data source or else from an intermediate near store device.
'''restore time'''
: the amount of time required to bring a desired data set back from the backup media. 
'''retention time'''
: the amount of time in which a given set of data will remain available for restore.  Some backup products rely on daily copies of data and measure retention in terms of days.  Others retain a number of copies of data changes regardless of the amount of time.
'''site-to-site backup'''
: backup, over the internet, to an offsite location under the user's control. Similar to remote backup except that the owner of the data maintains control of the storage location.
'''synthetic backup'''
: a term used by NetBackup for a restorable backup image that is synthesized on the backup server from a previous full backup and all the incremental backups since then.  It is equivalent to what a full backup would be if it were taken at the time of the last incremental backup.  
'''[[tape library]]'''
: a storage device which contains [[tape drive]]s, slots to hold tape cartridges, a barcode reader to identify tape cartridges and an automated method for physically moving tapes within the device.  These devices can store immense amounts of data.
'''true image restore'''
: a term used by NetBackup and Backup Exec for the collection of file deletion and file movement records so that an accurate restore can be performed.  For instance, consider a system that has a directory with 5 documents in it on Friday.  On Saturday, the system gets a full backup that includes those 5 documents.  On Monday, the owner of those documents deletes 2 of them and updates 1 of the 3 remaining.  That updated document gets backed up as part of The Monday night incremental backup.  On Tuesday afternoon the system crashes.  If we perform a normal restore of the full backup from Saturday and the incremental backup from Monday to the fresh system, we will have restored the 2 documents that were intentionally deleted.  True image restore keeps track of the deletions with each incremental backup and prevents the deleted files from being inappropriately restored.
'''[[trusted paper key]]'''
: a machine-readable print of a cryptographic key.
'''[[virtual Tape Library]] (VTL)'''
: a storage device that appears to be a tape library to backup software, but actually stores data by some other means.   A VTL can be configured as a temporary storage location before data is actually sent to real tapes or it can be the final storage location itself.

The '''Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance''' (commonly known as the '''Rio Treaty''', the '''Rio Pact''', or by the [[Spanish-language]] acronym '''TIAR''' from '''''Tratado Interamericano de Asistencia Recíproca''''') was an agreement signed in 1947 in [[Rio de Janeiro]] among many countries of the [[Americas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia®.|date=2013|author=n.d. |publisher=Columbia University Press |url=https://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Inter-American+Treaty+of+Reciprocal+Assistance |accessdate=August 31, 2018 |chapter=Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The central principle contained in its articles is that an attack against one is to be considered an attack against them all; this was known as the "hemispheric defense" doctrine. The treaty was initially created in 1947 and came into force in 1948, in accordance with Article 22 of the treaty. The [[Bahamas]] was the most recent country to sign and ratify it in 1982.&lt;ref name=sign&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oas.org/juridico/english/sigs/b-29.html |title=B-29: INTER-AMERICAN TREATY OF RECIPROCAL ASSISTANCE (RIO TREATY) |accessdate=1 March 2014|work=Organization of American States}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several countries have however breached the treaty in multiple ocations.

==Background and history==
The [[United States]] maintained a hemispheric defense policy relative to European influence under the [[Monroe Doctrine]] since 1823, which became increasingly interventionist with the [[Roosevelt Corollary]] in 1904. During the 1930s the US had been alarmed by [[Axis Powers|Axis]] overtures toward military cooperation with Latin American governments; apparent strategic threats against the [[Panama Canal]] were of particular concern. These were discussed in a series of meetings of the [[International Conference of American States]] and the 1936 Inter-American Conference for the Maintenance of Peace.&lt;ref name="ChapAct"&gt;[http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Act_of_Chapultepec.aspx Act of Chapultepec] The Oxford Companion to World War II, 2001, I. C. B. Dear and M. R. D. Foot&lt;/ref&gt; During the war Washington had been able to secure [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] support from all individual governments except [[Uruguay]], which remained neutral, and [[Argentina]], whose government was not recognized by the Allied powers.&lt;ref name="ChapAct"/&gt; Some countries had signed the [[Declaration by United Nations]] in early 1942 and more had signed by the end of 1945. At the Inter-American Conference on the Problems of War and Peace, in [[Mexico City]] during February and March 1945, discussions of the post-war world order were held and produced the Act of Chapultepec.&lt;ref name="ChapAct"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibiblio.org/pha/policy/1945/1945-03-03a.html Act of Chapultepec: Declarations on Reciprocal Assistance and American Solidarity], March 3, 1945, Pillars of Peace, Documents Pertaining To American Interest In Establishing A Lasting World Peace: January 1941-February 1946, Book Department, Army Information School, Carlisle Barracks, Pa., May 1946&lt;/ref&gt;

In light of the developing [[Cold War]] and following the statement of the [[Truman Doctrine]], the US wished to make those new anti-communist commitments permanent. The Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance was the first of many so-called 'mutual security agreements',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Alliances, Coalitions, and Ententes - The american alliance system: an unamerican tradition |url=http://www.americanforeignrelations.com/A-D/Alliances-Coalitions-and-Ententes-The-american-alliance-system-an-unamerican-tradition.html |website=Encyclopedia of the New American Nation |publisher=Advameg, Inc. |accessdate=August 31, 2018 |date=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the formalization of the Act of Chapultepec. The treaty was adopted by the original signatories on 2 September 1947 in [[Rio de Janeiro]] (hence the colloquial name "Rio Treaty"). It came into force on 3 December 1948 and was registered with the [[United Nations]] on 20 December 1948.&lt;ref name=sign/&gt;

The treaty was invoked numerous times during the 1950s and 1960s, in particular supporting the United States' naval blockade unanimously during the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]]. With the exceptions of [[Trinidad and Tobago]] (1967) and the [[Bahamas]] (1982), no countries that became independent after 1947 have joined the treaty; [[Canada]] is yet to become a member, though it already has [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization|separate defense commitments]] with the US. During the [[Falklands War]] (''Malvinas'' in Spanish), the United States, despite having signed the Rio Treaty before the [[NATO]] alliance, arguing that Argentina was the aggressor, favored the [[United Kingdom]], as did Chile and Colombia. This was seen by most Latin American countries as the final failure of the treaty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sennes |first1=Ricardo |last2=Onuki |first2=Janina |last3=de Oliveira |first3=Amacio Jorge |title=The Brazilian foreign policy and the hemispheric security |journal=Revista Fuerzas Armadas y Sociedad |date=2006 |volume=1 |issue=SE |url=http://socialsciences.scielo.org/scielo.php?pid=S0717-14982006000100001&amp;script=sci_arttext |accessdate=1 September 2018 |location=Santiago |issn=0717-1498 |quote=Additionally, the deep weakening of hemispheric relations occurred due to the American support, without mediation, to the United Kingdom in the Malvinas war in 1982, which definitively turned TIAR in dead letter.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Malamud |first1=Carlos |title=México abandona el TIAR.

In September 2002, citing the Falklands example &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=OEA: México abandona el TIAR |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/spanish/latin_america/newsid_2242000/2242240.stm |accessdate=August 31, 2018 |work=BBC Mundo |agency=BBC |publisher=Servicio Mundial de la BBC |date=6 September 2002 |language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oas.org/OASpage/press2002/en/press2001/sept01/09007.htm OAS official document: ''He cited the 1982 conflict over the Malvinas Islands as a classic demonstration of the Treaty's failure'']&lt;/ref&gt; and anticipating the Iraq War, [[Mexico]] formally withdrew from the treaty; after the requisite two years, Mexico ceased to be a signatory in September 2004.

On 2008, the [[Union of South American Nations]] (UNASUR) created a new regional security council to take care of their own defence issues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.agenciaenpie.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=481&amp;Itemid=38 Nace UNASUR y alianza militar sin EE.UU.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=FILATINA |title=La defensa regional en manos propias: UNASUR |url=https://filatina.wordpress.com/2009/04/14/4474/ |website=BLOG DE FILATINA (Fundación Integradora Latinoamericana) |publisher=Fundación Integradora Latinoamericana Ambiental |accessdate=1 September 2018 |date=April 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 June 2012, [[Bolivarian Alliance for the Americas|ALBA]] countries [[Bolivia]], [[Ecuador]], [[Nicaragua]] and [[Venezuela]], under the leadership of leftist governments, initiated the retirement from the TIAR,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author1=Periódico La Jornada |authorlink1=La Jornada |title=Bolivia, Ecuador, Nicaragua y Venezuela dejan el mecanismo de defensa TIAR |url=http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2012/06/06/mundo/031n1mun|accessdate=1 September 2018 |work=La Jornada |agency=Afp, Dpa, Xinhua y Reuters |issue=Mundo |publisher=DEMOS S.A. de C.V. |date=6 June 2012 |page=31 |language=es-MX}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acercandonaciones.com/en/news/paises-del-alba-renunciaron-al-tiar-en-asamblea-de-oea.html ALBA countries renounced the TIAR in OAS Assembly]&lt;/ref&gt; a decision which the [[Obama Administration]] deplored as "unfortunate" but respected.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eluniversal.com/internacional/120606/eeuu-lamenta-que-bolivia-ecuador-nicaragua-y-venezuela-se-retiren-de-t EEUU lamenta que Bolivia, Ecuador, Nicaragua y Venezuela se retiren de TIAR]&lt;/ref&gt; The treaty has been denounced by Nicaragua on 20 September 2012, Bolivia on 17 October 2012, Venezuela on 14 May 2013, and Ecuador on 19 February 2014.

The '''Inter-Parliamentary Union''' ('''IPU'''; {{lang-fr|Union Interparlementaire [UIP]}}) is a global [[inter-parliamentary institution]] established in 1889 by [[Frédéric Passy]] ([[France]]) and [[William Randal Cremer]] ([[United Kingdom]]). It was the first permanent forum for political multilateral negotiations. Initially, the organization was for individual [[Member of Parliament|parliamentarians]], but has since transformed into an international organization of the parliaments of sovereign states. The national parliaments of 178 countries (the last three member countries are Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Vanuatu; Memberships were given during its 137th conference)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://tass.ru/politika/4646881|title=Матвиенко избрана председателем ассамблеи Межпарламентского союза|work=ТАСС|access-date=2017-10-17|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; are members of the IPU, and 12 regional parliamentary assemblies are associate members.&lt;ref name="Members"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ipu.org/about-us/members|title=Members|date=2016-05-13|work=Inter-Parliamentary Union|access-date=2017-12-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IPU has permanent [[United Nations General Assembly observers#Other entities|observer status at the United Nations General Assembly]].

==History==
Eight leading personalities of the IPU have received [[Nobel Peace Prize]]s:

*1901: [[Frédéric Passy]] (France)
*1902: [[Charles Albert Gobat]] (Switzerland)
*1903: [[Randal Cremer]] (United Kingdom)
*1908: [[Fredrik Bajer]] (Denmark)
*1909: [[Auguste Marie François Beernaert]] (Belgium)
*1913: [[Henri La Fontaine]] (Belgium)
*1921: [[Christian Lous Lange|Christian Lange]] (Norway)
*1927: [[Ferdinand Buisson]] (France)

The organisation's initial objective was the arbitration of conflicts. The IPU played an important part in setting up the [[Permanent Court of Arbitration]] in [[The Hague]]. Over time, its mission has evolved towards the promotion of [[democracy]] and inter-parliamentary dialogue. The IPU has worked for establishment of institutions at the inter-governmental level, including the [[United Nations]], an organization with which it cooperates and with which it has permanent observer status.

[[File:Inter-Parliamentary Union Members.png|thumb|right|300px|Map of IPU member states]]
Numerous bodies have expressed interest in the possibility of transforming the IPU into a [[United Nations Parliamentary Assembly]], among them the [[Committee for a Democratic UN]], the [[German Bundestag]] and the [[Socialist International]]. The [[Liberal International]] also considers this as an option.

The headquarters of the union have been moved several times since its inception.
Locations:
*1892–1911: [[Bern]] (Switzerland)
*1911–1914: [[Brussels]] (Belgium)
*1914–1920: [[Oslo]] (Norway)
*1921–present: [[Geneva]] (Switzerland)

The Assembly is assisted in its work by Standing Committees, whose number and terms of reference are determined by the Governing Council; Standing Committees shall normally prepare reports and draft resolutions for the Assembly.  No one delegate may record more than ten votes.
* Governing Council. The Governing Council normally holds two sessions a year. The Governing Council is composed of three representatives from each Member. The term of office of a member of the Governing Council lasts from one Assembly to the next and all the members of the Governing Council must be sitting members of Parliament. The Governing Council elects the President of the Inter-Parliamentary Union for a period of three years. It also elects the members of the Executive Committee and appoints the Secretary General of the Union.
* Executive Committee.  The Executive Committee is composed of the President of the Inter-Parliamentary Union, 15 members belonging to different Parliaments (elected by the Governing Council; not less than 12 are elected from among the members of the Governing Council) and the President of the Coordinating Committee of the Meeting of Women Parliamentarians. The fifteen elected seats are assigned to the geopolitical groups. Only parliamentarians from States where women have both the right to vote and the right to stand for election are eligible to the Executive Committee. The Executive Committee is the administrative organ of the Inter-Parliamentary Union.
* Secretariat. The Secretariat comprises the totality of the staff of the organisation under the direction of the Secretary General.

The Association of Secretaries General of Parliaments is a consultative body of the Inter-Parliamentary Union.

==The IPU and the United Nations==

The IPU marked the 50th anniversary of the United Nations, in 1995, by holding a special session in the [[United Nations Headquarters|General Assembly Hall]] before the start of the session,&lt;ref name="UN_A50561_page2"&gt;{{UN document |docid=A-50-561 |type=Document |body=General Assembly |session=50 |document_number=561 |highlight=rect_158,350_882,609 |page=2 |accessdate=2007-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; where they planned for closer cooperation with the United Nations.  The [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution|General Assembly Resolution]] passed during that session requested the Secretary-General to put this into action.&lt;ref name="UN_ARES5015"&gt;{{UN document |docid=A-RES-50-15 |type=Resolution |body=General Assembly |session=50 |resolution_number=15 |accessdate=2007-09-10|date=22 November 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An agreement was signed between the IPU and the Secretary-General on 24 July 1996 and subsequently ratified by a General Assembly Resolution, where the United Nations recognizes IPU as the world organization of parliaments.&lt;ref name="UN_A51402"&gt;{{UN document |docid=A-51-402 |type=Document |body=General Assembly |session=51 |document_number=402 |accessdate=2007-09-10| date=25 September 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UN_ARES517"&gt;{{UN document |docid=A-RES-51-7 |type=Resolution |body=General Assembly |session=51 |resolution_number=7 |accessdate=2007-09-10|date=7 November 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[wikt:Pursuant|Pursuant]] to this resolution, the Secretary-General submitted a report &lt;ref name="UN_A52456"&gt;{{UN document |docid=A-52-456 |type=Document |body=General Assembly |session=52 |document_number=456 |accessdate=2007-09-10| date=13 October 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was noted with appreciation by the General Assembly, who requested further strengthening of cooperation and another report.&lt;ref name="UN_ARES527"&gt;{{UN document |docid=A-RES-52-7 |type=Resolution |body=General Assembly |session=52 |resolution_number=7 |accessdate=2007-09-10|date=6 November 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This report detailed the measures that had been taken, including opening a liaison office in New York, and cooperation on issues such land-mines and the promotion of representative democracy.&lt;ref name="UN_A53458"&gt;{{UN document |docid=A-53-458 |type=Document |body=General Assembly |session=53 |document_number=458 |accessdate=2007-09-10|date=5 October 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Following an entire morning of debate&lt;ref name="UN_A53PV46_1998"&gt;{{UN document |docid=A-53-PV.46 |date=28 October 1998 |type=Verbatim Report |body=General Assembly |session=53 |meeting=46 |accessdate=2007-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; the General Assembly passed a resolution which simply stated that it "looks forward to continued close cooperation".&lt;ref name="UN_ARES5313"&gt;{{UN document |docid=A-RES-53-13 |type=Resolution |body=General Assembly |session=53 |resolution_number=13 |accessdate=2007-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following year (1999) the Secretary-General reported on an increased number of areas of cooperation,&lt;ref name="UN_A54379"&gt;{{UN document |docid=A-54-379 |type=Document |body=General Assembly |session=54 |document_number=379 |accessdate=2007-09-10|date=21 September 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; the issue was debated for an entire afternoon&lt;ref name="UN_A54PV41_1999"&gt;{{UN document |docid=A-54-PV.41 |date=27 October 1999 |type=Verbatim Report |body=General Assembly |session=54 |meeting=41 |accessdate=2007-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; (interrupted by a minute of silence held for tribute to [[Vazgen Sargsyan]], the Prime Minister of [[Armenia]] who had just at that time been [[1999 Armenian parliament shooting|killed by gunmen]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{ UN document |docid=A-54-PV.41 |body=General Assembly |type=Verbotim Report |session=54 |meeting=41 |page=20 |anchor=pg020-bk02 |date=27 October 1999 |meetingtime=15:00 |speakername=The President |accessdate=2007-09-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and passed a resolution requesting the IPU be allowed to address the Millennium General Assembly directly.&lt;ref name="UN_ARES5412"&gt;{{UN document |docid=A-RES-54-12 |type=Resolution |body=General Assembly |session=54 |resolution_number=12 |accessdate=2007-09-10| date=18 November 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Resolution ''59/19, Cooperation between the United Nations and the Inter-Parliamentary Union'', the UN General Assembly takes note of the recommendations in regard to engaging parliamentarians more systematically in the work of
the United Nations.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;[http://www.ipu.org/Un-e/a-res-59-19.pdf Resolution adopted by the General Assembly], 17 December 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

The final declaration of the Second World Conference of Speakers of Parliament, hosted at United Nations headquarters, took place in September 2005, was entitled ''Bridging the democracy gap in international relations: A stronger role for parliament''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipu.org/splz-e/sp-conf05/declaration.pdf Bridging the democracy gap in international relations: A stronger role for parliaments] UNO Second World Conference of Speakers of Parliaments, New York, 7 to 9 September 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Resolution adopted by the UN General Assembly, ''61/6, Cooperation between the United Nations and the Inter-Parliamentary Union'', on 27 November 2006, it calls for ''the further development of the annual parliamentary hearing at the United Nations and other specialized parliamentary meetings in the context of major United Nations meetings as joint United Nations-Inter-Parliamentary Union events''.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;[http://www.ipu.org/Un-e/a-61-L6-e.pdf Resolution 61/6: Cooperation between the United Nations and the Inter-Parliamentary Union], 27 November 2006, at IPU official website&lt;/ref&gt;

Every year during the fall session of the General Assembly the IPU organises a Parliamentary Hearing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipu.org/un-e/un-hearings.htm Cooperation with the UN: hearings] at IPU official website&lt;/ref&gt;  A resolution on cooperation between the United Nations and the IPU allowed for circulation of official IPU documents in the General Assembly.

UN and the IPU cooperate closely in various fields, in particular peace and security, economic and social development, international law, human rights, and democracy and gender issues, but IPU has not obtained the status of UN General Assembly subsidiary organ.

The '''National Inter-Union of the Galician Workers''' ({{lang-gl|Intersindical Nacional dos Traballadores Galegos}}, INTG) was a Galician union with an [[Anticapitalism|anticapiltalist]], [[Left-wing politics|leftist]] and [[Galician nationalism|Galician nationalist]] ideology, direct heir of the Intersindical Nacional Galega&lt;ref&gt;Galician National Inter-Union&lt;/ref&gt; (ING), and precursor of [[Confederación Intersindical Galega]] (CIG).

==Foundation==
The INTG was founded after the 1980 union elections, in which the two [[Galician nationalism|galician nationalist]] unions ran together; the [[Intersindical Nacional Galega]] (ING) and the [[Central de Traballadores Galegos]]&lt;ref&gt;in [[English language]]: Galician Workers Central&lt;/ref&gt; (CTG). Between both, they got 1679 delegates (17.5%), which was more than the 15% of the union representation required by the Spanish law to become a ''more representative union'' - which in practice, allows the presence of the union in the negotiations of the collective agreements. The strategic success represented by the unity of the ING and the CTG favored the consolidation of the unification of both unions into a single combative, [[Left-wing politics|leftist]] and [[Galician nationalism|Galician nationalist]] union, which occurred definitely in 1981 when both unions united and formed the INTG.

==Early years (1982-1984)==
In January 1982, the INTG celebrated its First Congress, where [[Lois Ríos]] was elected as general secretary. That same year, the Confederación Sindical Galega,&lt;ref&gt;Galician Union Confederation&lt;/ref&gt; a split of the Spanish [[Unión Sindical Obrera]] (USO) and linked with the [[Galician Socialist Party]]. In that year's election, the INTG got 1649 delegates (18.5%).

In 1983, [[Xan Carballo]], one of the main figures of the [[Communist Party of National Liberation]] (PCLN), was elected as the new general secretary of the INTG.

===The three strikes against naval conversion===
After the so-called [[Pactos de la Castellana]], the central government wanted to reconvert the public shipbuilding companies, the INTG, jointly with the Spanish trade unions [[CCOO]] and [[Unión General de Trabajadores|UGT]] called a strike in the [[comarca]] of [[Vigo]], one of the most affected cities by the new state policy., on April 15, 1983. The tension continued to grow in the following months, and the INTG, called for a [[general strike]] on February 14, 1984: the first [[general strike]] since the [[Spanish Civil War]],&lt;ref&gt;http://folgaxeral.info/&lt;/ref&gt; which was supported [[Galician Nationalist Bloc]] (BNG), [[Galiza Ceibe-OLN]], the [[PSG-EG]], the [[Communist Movement of Galicia|MCG]] and the [[Galician Revolutionary Students]]. CCOO and UGT also called to [[General strike|strike]], but only in the cities of [[Vigo]] and [[Ferrol, Spain|Ferrol]], where the main Galician [[shipyard]]s were located.

The success of the strike of February 14 made [[CCOO]] join INTG in to the call for another [[general strike]], to be celebrated on July 12. The [[Unión General de Trabajadores|UGT]] did not called to strike, due to its closed relationship with the [[PSOE]], which at the time ruled on [[Spain]]. Further, the UGT accused CCOO and the INTG of trying to create a climate of violence and unrest in [[Galicia, Spain|Galicia]], and compared the situation in Galicia to that in the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]]. The [[General strike|strike]] was considered a great success by the INTG and the rest of the [[Galician nationalism|galician nationalist]] organizations, which facilitated a third call to a general strike for November 29 of that same year (1984), then against the ''New social pact'' (AES) signed between UGT and the Spanish government, which advanced in line of the dismantling of the shipbuilding industry in the [[Ria de Vigo]] area. Again, CCOO joined the call of the INTG and the strike was a new success, mobilizing a large number of Galician [[comarcas]] and especially in [[Vigo]], where there were more than 100 000 protesters. The three general strikes generated a considerable increase in support for [[Galician nationalism|nationalist]] unionism through the figure of INTG.

==The split of the 1984 and the recovery of 1990==
Despite the great success of the [[general strike]]s led by the INTG, that same year of 1984 a critical internal current with the union leadership and its general secretary, [[Xan Carballo]], emerged. This current, called Converxencia Sindical Nacionalista&lt;ref&gt;Nationalist Union Convergence&lt;/ref&gt; (CSN), was linked with the PSG-EG, founded that year and directed by [[Camilo Nogueira]]. The CSN decided to abandon the INTG in 1985, forming the [[Confederación Xeral de Traballadores Galegos-Intersindical Nacional]] (CXTG), which celebrated in October of that year its first Congress. In it, [[Fernando Acuña]] was elected secretary general of the new union. In the union elections of 1986, the [[Confederación Xeral de Traballadores Galegos-Intersindical Nacional|CXTG]] won 1087 delegates and the INTG 1067 delegates.

On the other hand, the relationship with [[Confederación Xeral de Traballadores Galegos-Intersindical Nacional|CXTG]] also produced a fracture inside the INTG, that explained the four different candidates to the internal elections in the Third Congress, held in 1987. In it, the list close to the [[Galician Nationalist Bloc|BNG]] reached 6 representatives, the list close to the [[Galician People's Front|FPG]] reached 3 representatives and the candidacy close to the gained [[Assembleia do Povo Unido|APU]] 1 representative. [[Manuel Mera]] was elected secretary general.

==Recovering unity: creation of the CIG==
On April 2, 1990, the INTG and [[Confederación Xeral de Traballadores Galegos-Intersindical Nacional|CXTG]] made an unified list to the union elections, known as the Converxencia Intersindical Galega.&lt;ref&gt;Galician Unions Convergence&lt;/ref&gt;

After the unified candidacy in 1990, there was an organic unification in 1993, giving birth to the [[Confederación Intersindical Galega]]. [[Fernando Acuña]], who came from the [[Confederación Xeral de Traballadores Galegos-Intersindical Nacional|CXTG]], and that was linked to the [[Galician Unity]] party, was appointed as the general secretary in the first two conferences of the [[Trade union|union]].

On 27 June 1980, '''Itavia Flight 870''' (IH 870, AJ 421), a [[McDonnell Douglas DC-9]] passenger jet en route from [[Bologna]] to [[Palermo]], Italy, crashed into the [[Tyrrhenian Sea]] between the islands of [[Ponza]] and [[Ustica]], killing all 81 people on board. Known in Italy as the '''Ustica massacre''' ("strage di Ustica"), the disaster led to numerous investigations, legal actions and accusations, and continues to be a source of controversy, including claims of conspiracy by the Italian government and others. Former Italian President [[Francesco Cossiga]] attributed the crash to a missile fired from a [[French Navy]] aircraft, despite contrary evidence presented in a 1994 report. On 23&amp;nbsp;January 2013, Italy's top criminal court ruled that there was "abundantly" clear evidence that the flight was brought down by a missile.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost.com"&gt;{{Cite news |title=Italian court: Missile caused 1980 Mediterranean plane crash; Italy must pay compensation |agency=[[Associated Press]] |date=23 January 2013 |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/italian-court-missile-caused-1980-mediterranean-plane-crash-italy-must-pay-compensation/2013/01/28/8337ede8-6976-11e2-9a0b-db931670f35d_story.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The aircraft flown as Aerolinee Itavia Flight 870, a [[McDonnell Douglas DC-9|McDonnell Douglas DC-9-15]], was manufactured in 1966 and acquired by the airline on 27 February 1972 with the serial number CN45724/22 and registration I-TIGI (formerly N902H,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.planespotters.net/Production_List/McDonnell-Douglas/DC-9/45724,N902H-Hawaiian-Airlines.php
|title=I-TIGI Itavia McDonnell Douglas DC-9-15 – cn 45724 / ln 22 |publisher=planespotters.net |accessdate=2 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; operated by [[Hawaiian Airlines]]).

==Flight history==
On 27 June 1980 at 20:08 [[Central European Time|CET]], the plane departed with a delay of one hour and 53 minutes from [[Bologna Guglielmo Marconi Airport]] for a scheduled service to [[Palermo Punta Raisi Airport]], Sicily. With 77 passengers aboard, captain Domenico Gatti and first officer Enzo Fontana were at the controls, with two flight attendants.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zLUiLCx3vY&lt;/ref&gt; The flight was designated IH 870 by air traffic control, while the military radar system used AJ 421.

Contact was lost shortly after the last message from the aircraft was received at 20:37, giving its position over the  [[Tyrrhenian Sea]] near the island of Ustica, about {{convert|120|km|-1}} southwest of [[Naples]].&lt;ref&gt;"Italian DC-9 lost off Sicily." ''[[Flight International]]''. 5 July 1990. p. [http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1980/1980%20-%201610.html?search=Itavia 2]. ([http://www.flightglobal.com/FlightPDFArchive/1980/1980%20-%201610.PDF Direct PDF link], [https://www.webcitation.org/6S94UYSdp?url=http://www.flightglobal.com/FlightPDFArchive/1980/1980%20-%201610.PDF Archive])&lt;/ref&gt;
Two [[Italian Air Force]] [[F-104]]s were scrambled at 21:00 from [[Grosseto Airport|Grosseto Air Force Base]] to locate the accident area and search for any survivors, but failed to do so because of poor visibility.{{Citation needed|reason=two f-104 were in flight before the crash, landing at Grosseto air base. no information about F-104 crash-related take off from Grosseto, but hh3f helicopters from Ciampino.|date=June 2009}}

Floating wreckage and bodies were later found in the area. There were no survivors among the 81 people on board.

==Official investigation==
After years of investigations, no official explanation or final report has been provided by the [[Politics of Italy|Italian government]]. In 1989, the Parliamentary Commission on Terrorism, headed by Senator [[Giovanni Pellegrino]], issued an official statement concerning the disappearance of Flight 870, which became known as the "Ustica Massacre" (''Strage di Ustica'').

The definitive sentence asserted:
:"The DC9 incident occurred following a military interception action, the DC9 was shot down, the lives of 81 innocent citizens were destroyed by an action properly described as an act of war, real war undeclared, a covert international police action against our country, which violated its borders and rights."

:''"L'incidente al DC9 è occorso a seguito di azione militare di intercettamento, il DC9 è stato abbattuto, è stata spezzata la vita a 81 cittadini innocenti con un'azione, che è stata propriamente atto di guerra, guerra di fatto e non dichiarata, operazione di polizia internazionale coperta contro il nostro Paese, di cui sono stati violati i confini e i diritti."''

The perpetrators of the crime remain unidentified. The court, unable to proceed further, declared the case archived.

In July 2006, the re-assembled fragments of the DC-9 were returned to Bologna from [[Pratica di Mare Air Force Base]] near Rome.

In June 2008, Rome prosecutors reopened the investigation into the crash after former [[List of Presidents of the Italian Republic|Italian President]] [[Francesco Cossiga]] (who was prime minister when the incident occurred) said that the aircraft had been shot down by French warplanes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://uk.reuters.com/article/latestCrisis/idUKL2264892420080622 Italy Reopens Probe Into 1980 Plane Crash: Media], Reuters, 22 June 2008&lt;/ref&gt; On 7 July 2008, a claim for damages was served to the French President.

===High treason charges against Italian Air Force officials===
The role of [[Italian Air Force]] personnel in the tragedy is unclear. Several Air Force officials have been investigated and brought to court for a number of offenses, including falsification of documents, perjury, abuse of office and aiding and abetting. Four generals were charged with [[high treason]], on the allegations that they obstructed government investigation of the accident by withholding information about air traffic at the time of Ustica disaster.

The first ruling, on 30 April 2004, pronounced two of the generals, Corrado Melillo and Zeno Tascio, not guilty of high treason. Lesser charges against a number of other military personnel were also dropped. The abuse-of-office charge was no longer valid (because of legislative changes), and the other allegations could not be pursued further after the expiration of the [[statute of limitations]], as the disaster had occurred more than 15 years prior. For this same reason, action could not be taken against the other two generals, Lamberto Bartolucci and Franco Ferri. However, the ruling did not acquit them, and they were still alleged to be guilty of treason. In 2005, an appeals court ruled that the accusations were made on insufficient grounds. On 10 January 2007, the [[Court of Cassation (Italy)|Italian Court of Cassation]] upheld this ruling and conclusively closed the case, fully acquitting Bartolucci and Ferri of any wrongdoing.

In June 2010, Italian President [[Giorgio Napolitano]] urged all Italian authorities to cooperate in the investigation of the incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Troendle|first=Stefan|publisher=Tagesschau|title=Napolitano fordert Aufklärung des Absturzes von Ustica|date=27 June 2010|url=https://www.tagesschau.de/ausland/ustica108.html|accessdate=27 June 2010|quote=Zum Jahrestag der Flugzeugkatastrophe von Ustica hat Italiens Staatspräsident Giorgio Napolitano alle staatlichen Stellen aufgefordert, daran mitzuarbeiten, das Unglück endlich aufzuklären.

In September 2011, a Palermo civil tribunal ordered the Italian government to pay 100 million euros ($137 million) in civil damages to the relatives of the victims for failing to protect the flight, concealing the truth and destroying evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Italy court fines government $137 million over mysterious crash of plane over Ustica |agency=[[Associated Press]] |date=13 September 2011 |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/italy-court-fines-government-137-million-over-mysterious-crash-of-plane-over-ustica/2011/09/13/gIQArlRxPK_story.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 January 2013, the Civil Cassation Court ruled that there was "abundantly" clear evidence that the flight was brought down by a stray [[missile]], confirming the lower court's order that the Italian government must pay compensation.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost.com"/&gt;

In April 2015, an appeals court in Palermo confirmed the rulings of the 2011 Palermo civil tribunal and rejected an appeal by the state attorney.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Ustica, Corte d’Appello conferma: "Il Dc-9 venne abbattuto da un missile" |date=8 April 2015 |newspaper=[[Il Fatto Quotidiano]] |url=http://www.ilfattoquotidiano.it/2015/04/08/ustica-corte-dappello-conferma-dc-9-venne-abbattuto-missile/1573006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hypotheses on the causes==
{{refimprove section|date=June 2013}}
Speculation at the time and in the years since has been fueled in part by media reports, military officials' statements and [[Air traffic control|ATC]]/[[Flight recorder|CVR]] recordings. Adding to the widespread conjecture was the observation of radar images showing trails of objects moving at high speeds.

===Terrorist bomb===
After the [[Years of Lead (Italy)|series of bombings that hit Italy in the 1970s]], a terrorist act was the first explanation to be proposed. As the flight was delayed in Bologna by almost three hours, a bomb's timer may have been set to actually cause an explosion at the Palermo airport, or on a further flight of the same plane. The technical commission supporting a 1990 judicial enquiry reported that an explosion in the rear toilet, and not a missile strike, was the only conclusion supported by the wreckage analysis.&lt;ref name="taylorrep"&gt;[http://aviation-safety.net/pubs/other/Taylor_paper_Ustica_illustrated.pdf A. Frank Taylor, "A Case History Involving Wreckage Analysis:   Lessons from the Ustica investigations"] ([https://www.webcitation.org/6SAEPRdmq?url=http://aviation-safety.net/pubs/other/Taylor_paper_Ustica_illustrated.pdf Archive])&lt;/ref&gt;

Fourteen years after the accident, a 1994 joint investigation carried out by the British [[Air Accidents Investigation Branch]] (AAIB) and Italian investigators found conclusive physical evidence (as per the wreckage recovered) that a bomb had indeed exploded mid-flight in the rear lavatory. A large section of the aircraft's fuselage around the lavatory was never recovered (presumably having disintegrated in the explosion). A test explosion in a DC-9 lavatory showed the resulting deformation in the surrounding structure to be almost identical to that of the incident aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;See:

===Missile strike during military operation===
Major sources in the Italian media have alleged that the aircraft was shot down during a [[dogfight]] involving Libyan, United States, French and Italian Air Force fighters in an assassination attempt by NATO members on an important Libyan politician, perhaps even Libyan leader [[Muammar al-Gaddafi]], who was flying in the same airspace that evening.&lt;ref name="historicwings"&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Italy's Darkest Night |author=Thomas Van Hare |journal=Historic Wings |date=27 June 2012 |url=http://fly.historicwings.com/2012/06/italys-darkest-night/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; This version was supported in 1999 by investigative magistrate Rosario Priore,&lt;ref name=Guardian&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/elsewhere/journalist/story/0,,1825348,00.html The Mystery of Flight 870], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 21 July 2006 {{en icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; who said in his concluding report that his investigation had been deliberately obstructed by the Italian military and members of the secret service, in compliance with NATO requests.&lt;ref name=Guardian/&gt;

According to the Italian media, documents from the archives of the Libyan secret service passed on to [[Human Rights Watch]] after the [[Battle of Tripoli (2011)|fall of Tripoli]] show that Flight 870 and the Libyan MiG were attacked by two French jets.&lt;ref name="Malta"&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Libyan secret documents said to uncover Ustica tragedy… and how Gaddafi escaped to Malta unscathed |author=Noel Grima |date=18 September 2011 |journal=[[The Malta Independent]] |url=http://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2011-09-18/news/libyan-secret-documents-said-to-uncover-ustica-tragedy-and-how-gaddafi-escaped-to-malta-unscathed-298884/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 July 1980, 21 days after the Aerolinee Itavia Flight 870 incident, the wreckage of a Libyan MiG-23, along with its deceased pilot, was found on the Sila Mountains in Castelsilano, Calabria, southern Italy, according to official reports.&lt;ref name="Cooper Grandolini 2015 p. 41"&gt;{{cite book | last=Cooper | first=T. | last2=Grandolini | first2=A. | title=Libyan Air Wars: Part 1: 1973-1985 | publisher=Helion, Limited | series=Africa@War | year=2015 | isbn=978-1-910777-51-0 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aVbdCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA41 | language=ms | access-date=2018-03-14 | page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conspiracy theories==
Several [[conspiracy theories]] explaining the disaster persist.&lt;ref name="NYT 2013"&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Conspiracy Buffs Gain in Court Ruling on Crash |author=Elisabetta Povoledo |date=10 February 2013 |journal=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/11/world/europe/itavia-flight-870-ruling-adds-support-to-a-theory.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the vessel that carried out the search for debris on the ocean floor was French, but only US officials had access to the aircraft parts they found. 
Several radar reports were erased and several Italian generals were indicted 20 years later for obstruction of justice. The difficulty the investigators and the victims' relatives had in receiving complete, reliable information on the Ustica disaster has been popularly described as ''un muro di gomma'' (literally, a rubber wall),&lt;ref name="NYT 1992"&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Italian Obsession: Was Airliner Shot Down? |author=ALAN COWELL |date=10 February 1992 |journal=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/02/10/world/italian-obsession-was-airliner-shot-down.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; because investigations just seemed to "bounce back".

==Memorial==
[[File:Museo ustica.JPG|thumb|right|Remains of the plane at the Museum for the Memory of Ustica, Bologna, Italy]]
On 27 June 2007, the Museum for the Memory of Ustica was opened in Bologna. The museum is in possession of parts of the plane, which are assembled and on display, including almost all of the external fuselage. The museum also has objects belonging to those on board that were found in the sea near the plane. 
[[Christian Boltanski]] was commissioned to produce a site-specific installation.
The installation consists of:
* 81 pulsing lamps hanging over the plane
* 81 black mirrors
* 81 loudspeakers (behind the mirrors)
Each loudspeaker describes a simple thought/worry (e.g. "when I arrive I will go to the sea")
All the objects found are contained in a wooden box covered with a black plastic skin.
A small book with the photos of all objects and various information is available to visitors upon request.

==Dramatization==
{{refimprove section|date=January 2014}}
{{undue weight|date=January 2014}}
The accident was featured in the 13th season of the Canadian documentary series ''[[Mayday (Canadian TV series)|Mayday]]'' in an episode entitled "[[List of Mayday episodes#Season 13 .282013.29|Massacre Over The Mediterranean]]". The film examined the heavy public pressure placed upon investigators to uncover the cause of the accident, and also considered the three separate technical investigations that occurred. It ultimately advanced the conclusions of the third and final technical investigation, which concluded that the wreckage ruled out a missile and pointed to an explosion in or near the rear lavatory.&lt;ref name="taylorrep" /&gt;

The documentary was highly critical of the Italian judiciary's failure to officially release the third technical investigation to the public, or to consider its conclusion that missiles were not responsible. Interviewee David Learmount of [[Flight International]] magazine made the following comments:
* "The judiciary in Italy just found Frank Taylor's findings inconvenient. I don't think they ordered it not to be published, they just made a decision that they wouldn't publish it."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* "I'm sorry, but Italy is a dreadful place to have an aviation accident. If you want the truth, you're less likely to find it there than just about anywhere else in the world."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* "Frank Taylor's team didn't reach any conclusions except ones which were based on hard physical evidence. There was no theorizing going on."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Frank Taylor, a British investigator involved in the third technical inquest, also commented:

:"We discovered quite clearly that somebody had planted a bomb there, but nobody on the legal side, it would appear, believed us and therefore, so far as we are aware, there has been no proper search for who did it, why they did it, or anything else. As an engineer and an investigator I cannot see why anybody would want to consider anything other than the truth."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;2014-05-01. URL:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zLUiLCx3vY. Accessed: 1 May 2014. (Archived by WebCite® at https://www.webcitation.org/6PFsar96P?url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zLUiLCx3vY&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1991 Italian film by [[Marco Risi]], ''[[The Rubber Wall]]'', tells the story of a journalist in search of answers to the many questions left open by the accident. The film theorises on a few possible scenarios, including the possibility that the DC-9 was mistakenly shot down during an aerial engagement between NATO and Libyan jet fighters.

The '''Ivan Allen Jr. Prize for Social Courage''' is an international award established in 2010 by the [[Georgia Institute of Technology]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ivanallenprize.gatech.edu/home/ |title=Ivan Allen Jr. Prize for Social Courage |last=[[G. P. "Bud" Peterson]] President Georgia Institute of Technology |publisher=Georgia Institute of Technology |accessdate=4 February 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120909052514/http://ivanallenprize.gatech.edu/home/ |archivedate= 9 September 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; in recognition of the late [[Ivan Allen Jr.]]  A Georgia Tech alumnus, Allen became a pivotal leader during America's struggle for racial integration during the 1960s. While mayor of [[Atlanta, Georgia]], USA (1962–1970), Allen risked his place in society, his political future, and his life when he testified before the U.S. Senate Commerce Committee in support of what became the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]].&lt;ref&gt;Mayor: Notes on the Sixties. Ivan Allen Jr., Paul Hemphill. Simon and Schuster, New York 1971.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ivan Allen Jr. Prize for Social Courage recognizes individuals who, like Mayor Allen, stand up for moral principles and render service to humanity without regard for personal or professional peril. Recipients positively affect public discourse in spite of the risk to their careers, their livelihoods, and even their lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ivanallenprize.gatech.edu |title=President's Welcome &amp;#124; ivanallenprize2.gatech.edu &amp;#124; Georgia Institute of Technology &amp;#124; Atlanta, GA |publisher=Ivanallenprize.gatech.edu |date= |accessdate=2015-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The Prize is funded in perpetuity by a grant from the Wilbur and Hilda Glenn Family Foundation.  It was awarded for the first time on March 15, 2011, replacing the [[Ivan Allen Jr. Prize for Progress and Service]], which had been awarded from 2001–2010 to prominent Georgians.&lt;ref name="gatech1"&gt;[http://ivanallenprize.gatech.edu/news/release.php?nid=63120 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119201522/http://ivanallenprize.gatech.edu/news/release.php?nid=63120 |date=January 19, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prize recipients==
===Beatrice Mtetwa===
Prominent human rights attorney Beatrice Mtetwa has been named recipient of the Ivan Allen Jr. Prize for Social Courage, an award given to individuals who, by asserting moral principle, have positively affected public discourse at the risk of their careers, livelihoods, and sometimes lives.

The Ivan Allen Jr. Prize for Social Courage will be presented to Beatrice Mtetwa during a ceremony on the Georgia Tech campus on November 13, 2014. The presentation of this 2014 award is especially significant as Mtetwa, an advocate for women’s equality and advancement, will be the first woman to receive the prize. It also comes at a time when government leaders in Zimbabwe are persecuting human rights defenders such as Mtetwa.

===Congressman John Lewis===
On April 3, 2013, Congressman [[John Lewis (Georgia politician)|John Lewis]], an icon of American Civil Rights was honored as the third recipient of the Ivan Allen Jr. Prize for Social Courage.&lt;ref name="gatechcivil"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iac.gatech.edu/news-and-events/features/04/2013/an-unflinching-advocate-for-civil-rights-john |accessdate=June 24, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140112013415/http://www.iac.gatech.edu/news-and-events/features/04/2013/an-unflinching-advocate-for-civil-rights-john |archivedate=January 12, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lewis was one of the "[[Big Six (civil rights)|Big Six]]" leaders of the Civil Rights Movement. He was the keynote speaker for the [[March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom|1963 March on Washington]], of which he was a core architect. Lewis' impact on civil rights for African-Americans has included advocating for desegregation laws and voters’ rights. A founding member and president of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), Lewis planned and led many of their activities. His personal courage was first evident when he led student sit-ins that resulted in the public accommodation of African-Americans at Nashville restaurants. He was one of the original 13 Freedom Riders who challenged legally sanctioned segregation on interstate buses. Despite repeated attacks on his dignity, physical beatings, and arrests, Lewis has remained staunchly committed to nonviolent work for social change throughout his life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://johnlewis.house.gov/john-lewis/biography |title=Biography &amp;#124; The Website of Congressman John Lewis, Serving the 5th Congressional District of Georgia |publisher=Johnlewis.house.gov |date= |accessdate=2015-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"I always did what I could do to help other people," Lewis said at the ceremony while reflecting on his role in the civil rights movement. "I wanted to make a difference in order to meet the pressing need of people left out or left behind. I was inspired to find a way to a 'new way.' And this inspires me today, as I continue to keep pushing on."
Georgia Tech President G.P. "Bud" Peterson said, "Congressman Lewis made his mind up to accomplish many things throughout his lifetime, and his accomplishments will transcend generations. He has dedicated his life to protecting human rights, securing civil liberties, and building what he calls 'The Beloved Community' in America. His unflinching civil rights leadership and ongoing advocacy for social change throughout his career have elevated the cause of human rights around the world."&lt;ref name="gatechcivil"/&gt;

===Dr. William H. Foege===
In March 2012, [[William H. Foege]] was honored as the second recipient of the Ivan Allen Jr. Prize for Social Courage.&lt;ref name="gatech2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ivanallenprize.gatech.edu/news/release.php?nid=118371 |accessdate=September 20, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130128031359/http://ivanallenprize.gatech.edu/news/release.php?nid=118371 |archivedate=January 28, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
An American epidemiologist, Foege is best known as the architect of the surveillance and containment strategy that successfully eradicated the [[smallpox]] virus. He has also overseen, through leadership in the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]], The [[Carter Center]], and the Task Force for Child Survival (now the Task Force for Global Health), the eradication of [[Guinea worm disease]], [[polio]], and [[measles]], and the elimination of [[river blindness]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sph.emory.edu/GHI/aboutUs/advisoryBoard/foege.php |title=Rollins School of Public Health &amp;#124; Hubert Department of Global Health (GH) |publisher=Sph.emory.edu |date= |accessdate=2015-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="usnews2007"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/news/best-leaders/articles/2007/11/12/william-h-foege_print.html |accessdate=September 20, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110121174557/http://www.usnews.com/news/best-leaders/articles/2007/11/12/william-h-foege_print.html |archivedate=January 21, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At times risking his own health and safety, Dr. Foege’s efforts have brought about extraordinary progress across an astonishing breadth of health issues, literally saving millions of lives.&lt;ref name="usnews2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gatech2"/&gt;
Speaking about Foege’s merit in receiving the Prize, Jacqueline J. Royster, Dean of the Georgia Institute of Technology [[Ivan Allen College of Liberal Arts]] said,  “Like former Atlanta Mayor Ivan Allen Jr., Dr. Foege has envisioned a better world and created communities for realizing that dream in the face of seemingly insurmountable problems. His courage to do the right thing and his steadfastness, sometimes in the face of staunch opposition, has saved millions of lives and reshaped the global dialogue about what is possible in health and social progress.”
Georgia Tech President Peterson also commented. “Dr. Foege’s ability to develop and implement innovative health strategies has alleviated much human suffering in our world today and for generations to come.  It is our privilege to honor Dr. Foege for his deep moral commitment to humanitarian progress and his lifetime of service through Georgia Tech’s Ivan Allen Prize for Social Courage.”&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20121210104038/http://ivanallenprize.gatech.edu/news/release.php?nid=74321 ]&lt;/ref&gt;
Upon receiving the Prize, Foege said, “I use the occasion also to encourage everyone to believe that the health situation in the world is both dire and correctable.  It takes hope and action, and absolute tenacity.”&lt;ref&gt;Ivan Allen College of Liberal Arts, G. I. o. T. (2012). Founder's Day: Address - William H. Foege. Videos from Founder's Day 2012 events&lt;/ref&gt;

===Senator Sam Nunn===
The first recipient of the Ivan Allen Jr. Prize for Social Courage was [[Sam Nunn]] who served as a United States Senator from Georgia from 1972–1996.

In 1991, Nunn co-authored the Nunn-Lugar Act, which set up the [[Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction]] Program that is credited with aiding [[former Soviet republics]] in ridding their territories of nuclear weapons.  As of June 2014, the program had contributed to the deactivation of more than 7,600 [[nuclear warheads]], neutralized [[chemical weapons]], safeguarded [[fissile material]], converted weapons facilities for peaceful use, mitigated bio-threats, and redirected the work of former weapons scientists and engineers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://armscontrolcenter.org/publications/factsheets/fact_sheet_the_cooperative_threat_reduction_program/ |title=Fact Sheet: The Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction Program &amp;#124; Center for Arms Control &amp; Non-Proliferation |publisher=Armscontrolcenter.org |date= |accessdate=2015-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Senator Nunn is co-chairman and CEO of the [[Nuclear Threat Initiative]] (NTI), a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization that focuses on reducing global threats from weapons of mass destruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iac.gatech.edu/news-and-events/annual-founders-day/ivan-allen-jr-prize-recipients |accessdate=March 16, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120121134541/http://www.iac.gatech.edu/news-and-events/annual-founders-day/ivan-allen-jr-prize-recipients |archivedate=January 21, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When announcing Senator Nunn as the recipient of the Ivan Allen Jr. Prize for Social Courage, Georgia Institute of Technology President Peterson stated, “While some individuals talk about achieving world peace, Sam Nunn has actively pursued this vision and created a legacy that continues to reap results long after his exit from public office.” Peterson lauded Nunn for courage and commitment to his own moral compass, for standing up for his beliefs, and for enacting meaningful and sustainable solutions for making the world a better, and more peaceful place.&lt;ref name="gatech1"/&gt;

==Prize history==
The Ivan Allen Jr. Prize for Social Courage was established in 2010 by the Georgia Institute of Technology.  The international award honors individuals whose life and work embody the moral courage personified by former Atlanta Mayor Ivan Allen Jr.&lt;ref name="gatech3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ivanallenprize.gatech.edu/news/release.php?nid=58155 |accessdate=September 20, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320015108/http://ivanallenprize.gatech.edu/news/release.php?nid=58155 |archivedate=March 20, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Prize underscores the Institute’s mission to improve the human condition by recognizing those around the globe who, like Mayor Allen, have risked everything to stand up for moral principle and have made a positive difference in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ivanallenprize.gatech.edu/home/ |accessdate=September 20, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120909052514/http://ivanallenprize.gatech.edu/home/ |archivedate=September 9, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Prize is funded in perpetuity by a grant from the Wilbur and Hilda Glenn Family Foundation.&lt;ref name="gatech3"/&gt; 

The prize's forerunner was the [[Ivan Allen Jr. Prize for Progress and Service]], which was awarded annually from 2001–2010 by the Georgia Tech.&lt;ref name="gatech3"/&gt;

Jordan Jr.''' (1924 - 14 June 1991) was an [[African Americans|African American]] lawyer and [[Civil and political rights|civil rights activist]]. He worked as a lawyer and judge and was part of the lawsuit heard before the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] that ended [[Poll tax|poll taxes]].

== Biography ==
Jordan was raised in [[Norfolk, Virginia]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/17430524/the_pittsburgh_courier/|title=Paralyzed Vet Gets Degree; Plans Law Career, Matrimony|last=|first=|date=1949-07-02|work=The Pittsburgh Courier|access-date=2018-02-14|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|pages=6|via=Newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; He went to the [[Booker T.

In 1954, he set up a law practice in Norfolk.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 1955, when the state of [[Virginia]] planned to create a referendum to allow [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregation]], Jordan filed an [[injunction]] to block the vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/17431316/the_progressindex/|title=Virginia Faces Test on Plans for Referendum|last=|first=|date=1955-12-07|work=The Progress-Index|access-date=2018-02-14|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|pages=1|via=Newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Jordan and another civil rights activist, [[Evelyn Thomas Butts]], were restrained from picketing a supermarket for not hiring black people in high level jobs, Jordan fought the restraining order, but lost.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.lva.virginia.gov/public/trailblazers/res/Butts_Victor-Expects-Another-Fight.pdf|title=Victor Expects Another Fight|last=McAllister|first=Bill|date=25 March 1966|work=The Virginian-Pilot|access-date=14 February 2018|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|via=Library of Virginia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/17403158/daily_press/|title=Norfolk Judge Halts Pickets at Be-Lo Store|last=|first=|date=1960-03-15|work=Daily Press|access-date=2018-02-13|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|pages=9|via=Newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Jordan was involved in several anti-segregation cases in 1961, 1962 and 1964 in Virginia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/9238562/the_progressindex/|title=Massive Suit Hits Danville Segregation|last=|first=|date=1962-08-22|work=The Progress-Index|access-date=2018-02-13|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|pages=14|via=Newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/17451206/kingsport_news/|title=Store Hires Two Negro Clerks|last=|first=|date=1961-03-16|work=Kingsport News|access-date=2018-02-14|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|pages=14|via=Newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/17451388/the_news_leader/|title=Old Dominion News Briefs|last=|first=|date=1964-02-07|work=The News Leader|access-date=2018-02-14|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|pages=5|via=Newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November of 1963, Butts hired him to sue the state for requiring a [[poll tax]] to vote.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/17402384/daily_press/|title=Ceremony Marks Poll Tax Repeal|last=|first=|date=1996-03-27|work=Daily Press|access-date=2018-02-13|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|pages=13|via=Newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case was dismissed by the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit|4th Circuit Court of Appeals]] in 1964.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; In May of 1964, Jordan and Butts filed another suit which accused the state of violating four amendments of the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] with the poll tax.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Butts' case against the poll tax was appealed to the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] and was bundled with another case, ''[[Harper v.

When the case went before the Supreme Court, Jordan argued that the poll tax laws had successfully barred black people not only from voting, but from holding office.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://ideastations.org/radio/news/patriotism-perseverance-and-end-poll-tax|title=Patriotism, Perseverance and the End of the Poll Tax|last=Komp|first=Catherine|date=2016-03-17|work=Community Idea Stations|access-date=2018-02-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jordan said, "Almost like a magic wand after the passage of this law, these poll tax laws, not a single Negro has sat in the Virginia General Assembly, and not a single Negro has held a single elected state office in the state of Virginia."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The decision was made by the Supreme Court in two months and they decided that the poll tax or voting fee did violate the [[Equal Protection Clause]] of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th Amendment]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

In 1968, Jordan was elected to the Norfolk City Council and became the first black person to hold the seat since 1889.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/17452005/the_progressindex/|title=400 Marchers Hit Norfolk|last=|first=|date=1968-05-17|work=The Progress-Index|access-date=2018-02-14|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|pages=6|via=Newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1971, Jordan was the only black member of the city council.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/17426032/the_corpus_christi_callertimes/|title=Busing Blamed for Flight of Whites from Norfolk|last=|first=|date=1971-12-10|work=The Corpus Christi Caller-Times|access-date=2018-02-13|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|pages=2|via=Newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1972, he became the vice-mayor of Norfolk.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RcrzCQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA83&amp;dq=%22joseph%20a%20jordan%22&amp;pg=PA83#v=onepage&amp;q=%22joseph%20a%20jordan%22&amp;f=false|title=On This Day in Norfolk, Virginia History|last=Downing|first=Sarah|publisher=Arcadia Publishing|year=2015|isbn=9781626197039|location=|pages=83|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1974, Jordan resigned as vice-mayor in protest, "saying the city is being run by the Norfolk Redevelopment Authority rather than City Council."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/17452088/the_news_leader/|title=Norfolk Vice Mayor Resigns|last=|first=|date=1974-11-06|work=The News Leader|access-date=2018-02-14|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|pages=15|via=Newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16085">'''Kahrizak Detention Center''' (in Persian: بازداشتگاه کهریزک) is a detainment facility operated by the [[Judicial system of Iran]] in southern [[Tehran]].

==Before 2009 election protests==
Authorities first made plans for the Kahrizak detention center in 2001.   The center's cells, located underground, were apparently built without free access to fresh air and toilet facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |script-title=fa:گزارش تکان دهنده از برخوردهای صورت گرفته با متهمین با عنوان " اراذل و اوباش" |publisher= Committee of Human Rights Reporters |language = Persian|date= 2007-07-31 |url= http://www.schrr.net/spip.php?article302 |accessdate =2009-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  With the appointment of [[Ahmad-Reza Radan]] to the post of Tehran police chief, the center became a key site for carrying out the "Public Security Plan" targeting drug addicts and so-called "thugs and louts" endangering public morality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|script-title=fa:دستور تعطیلی گوانتاناموی ایران صادر شد |publisher=[[Rooz Online]] |date=2009-07-29 |language=Persian |url=http://www.roozonline.com/persian/news/newsitem/article/2009/july/29//-16183e1262.html |accessdate=2009-07-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090801044636/http://www.roozonline.com/persian/news/newsitem/article/2009/july/29/-16183e1262.html |archivedate=August 1, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reports of inhumane treatment of the prisoners at Kahrizak were released, with some comparing the conditions there unfavorably to even the notorious political [[Prison 209|ward 209]] of [[Evin prison]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |script-title=fa:افشای نام بازداشتگاهی در عمق زمین ومخوف تر از 209 اوین |publisher = Peik Net |date = 2007-07-30 |url = http://www.peiknet.com/1386/08mordad/10/page/32kahrizak.htm|language=Persian |accessdate = 2009-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Opposition groups have published unverified reports of human rights abuses and as many as 6,000 deaths inside the prison during the years 2007 and 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Shocking crimes in mullahs' medieval prison of Kahrizak unveiled |publisher = National Council of Resistance |date= 2008-12-13 |url = http://ncr-iran.org/content/view/5867/106/ |accessdate = 2009-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2009 election protests==
Several thousand civilians and activists were arrested after the [[2009 Iranian election protests|disputed presidential election in 2009]].  The head of the national security forces, [[Esmail Ahmadi-Moghaddam]], stated in an interview with state television on August 5, 2009 that only the most dangerous offenders involved in the election protests were to be delivered to the Kahrizak center, which has a 50 prisoner capacity.  The rest were to be taken to [[Evin prison]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Interview with Esmail Ahmadi-Moghaddam (audio only) |language=Persian |url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yg0atAMruPE&amp;eurl=http%3A%2F%2F |publisher=[[YouTube]] |accessdate=2009-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Tehran riot police and Basij members used other official and unofficial sites to detain suspects charged with endangering national security and public safety during the protests, including the [[Level -4 detention center]] in the [[Ministry of Interior (Iran)|Interior Ministry]] building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|script-title=fa:تایید وجود بازداشتگاه منفی 4 در وزارت کشور |publisher=[[Rooz Online]] |date=2007-07-30 |url=http://www.roozonline.com/persian/news/newsitem/article/2009/july/30//4-17.html |language=Persian |accessdate=2009-07-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090801035022/http://www.roozonline.com/persian/news/newsitem/article/2009/july/30/4-17.html |archivedate=August 1, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;   Ahmadi-Moghaddam further admitted in his television interview that many of the 140 prisoners he claimed to be housed at Kahrizak were low priority suspects.  [[Mohsen Ruholamini]], the son of a conservative politician who had supported pragmatic presidential candidate [[Mohsen Rezaei]], was among the Kahrizak prisoners.&lt;ref name=Straits&gt;{{cite web

On August 9, 2009, in a letter to the Chairman of the Expediency Discernment Council of Iran, [[Mehdi Karroubi]] demanded investigation of Iranian prisons for possible tortures and in particular sexual harassment of men and women.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etemademelli.ir/published/0/00/65/6571/]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/world/mideast-africa/displaystory.cfm?story_id=14222321 Iran and human rights: The crackdown]&lt;/ref&gt; On August 19, he wrote to parliament speaker Ali Larijani, asking to meet with him, President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, judiciary chief Ayatollah Sadeq Larijani, former president Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani and the state prosecutor to "personally present my documents and evidence over the cases of sexual abuse in some prisons specially Kahrizak."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ali Larijani]] and [[Sadeq Larijani]] (Judiciary committee) both officially rejected his claims and [[Ali Khamenei]]'s representatives, and Vice Chairman of National Security Commission of the parliament demanded Karroubi's arrest.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5ixeFBxfLzaSjs8Mb8cuFmtPOT6-wD9ALTVP00 dead link]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

==Detainee abuse==
The release of some prisoners from Kahrizak on July 28, 2009 was followed by a number of testimonials in the foreign and opposition press on conditions inside the prison. Various news articles have reported on cramped and squalid cells where prisoners were routinely [[verbally abused]] and beaten by guards, some to death. [[Ahmad-Reza Radan]], according to one account, daily took part in these beatings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==National reactions==
Following massive arrests of civilians and reformist activists by Iranian police, a number of Iranian intellectuals and reformist activists condemned the detentions, and called for the release of the imprisoned protesters.

In an exceptionally strong and critical speech,&lt;ref name=NYT20090728 &gt;{{cite news

Erstwhile prime minister Moussavi said, "How can it be that the leaders of our country do not cry out and shed tears about these tragedies? ... Can they not see it, feel it? These things are blackening our country, blackening all our hearts. If we remain silent, it will destroy us all and take us to hell."

Grand Ayatollah [[Hosein-Ali Montazeri]] on 29 July demanded prosecution of anybody responsible for abuses. "Can the government deceive people by closing a detention center and blaming all the faults on a building?" he said. "What benefit does the government gain from the crisis, except angering the majority of the people and weakening the Islamic republic?"&lt;ref name=TG20090729&gt;{{cite news

It was only after the death of the son of one of the conservative politicians, that the Iranian leader [[Ali Khamenei]] and head of Judicial System, [[Hashemi Shahroudi]] stepped in and ordered the closure of Kahrizak detention center.&lt;ref name=Reuters20090728 &gt;{{cite news

An official announcement was made on August 5, 2009 that three prison wardens were arrested in connection with the torture of detainees at Kahrizak.&lt;ref name=Straits /&gt;

On December 19, 2009, Iranian authorities acknowledged that at least three protesters had been beaten to death in the Kahrizak jail.  Twelve prison officials were charged with crimes, including murder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/20/world/middleeast/20iran.html?scp=1&amp;sq=kahrizak&amp;st=cse | work=The New York Times | title=Iran Charges 12 at Prison Over Death of Protesters | first=Robert F. | last=Worth | date=2009-12-20 | accessdate=2010-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Banned Books Week 2007 (1420101916).jpg|thumb|right|220px|A display of formerly banned books at a US library]]
'''Banned books''' are books or other printed works such as essays or plays which are prohibited by law or to which free access is not permitted by other means. The practice of banning books is a form of censorship, from political, legal, religious, moral, or (less often) commercial motives. This article lists notable banned books and works, giving a brief context for the reason that each book was prohibited. Banned books include fictional works such as novels, poems and plays and non-fiction works such as biographies and dictionaries.

Since there are a large number of banned books, some publishers have specialized in them. The best-known examples are the Parisian [[Obelisk Press]], which published [[Henry Miller]]'s sexually frank novel ''[[Tropic of Cancer (novel)|Tropic of Cancer]]'', and [[Olympia Press]], which published [[William Burroughs]]'s ''[[Naked Lunch]]''.  Both of these, the work of father [[Jack Kahane]] and son [[Maurice Girodias]], specialized in English-language books which were prohibited, at the time, in Great Britain and the United States. {{Interlanguage link multi|Ruedo ibérico|es}}, also located in Paris, specialized in books prohibited in Spain during the dictatorship of [[Francisco Franco]]. Russian literature prohibited during the Soviet period was published outside of Russia.

Books are still banned throughout the world. Nowhere in the world can everything be published, although the prohibitions vary strikingly from one country to another: [[hate speech]], for example, is prohibited in a number of countries, such as [[Censorship in Sweden|Sweden]], though the same books may be legal in the United States or United Kingdom, where the only prohibition is on [[child pornography]]. {{Citation needed|reason=Statement doesn't match with the current list|date=January 2018}}

In the United States, books have been and still are banned by school and public libraries, despite the opposition of the American Library Association to book bans. This is usually the result of complaints from parents, who find particular books not appropriate for their children (e.g., books about sexual orientation such as ''[[And Tango Makes Three]]''). In many libraries, including the [[British Library]] and the [[Library of Congress]], erotic books are housed in separate collections in restricted access reading rooms. In some libraries, a special application may be needed to read certain books.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Fryer, ''Private Case, Public Scandal'', London, Secker &amp; Warburg, 1966.&lt;/ref&gt; Libraries sometimes avoid purchasing controversial books, and the personal opinions of librarians have at times impacted book selection.

Figueroa]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newformulation.org/4Morse.htm Magonismo: An Overview]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon}} [http://www.antorcha.net/biblioteca_virtual/historia/beas/4.html History of Magonism]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Magonism and anarchism==
[[File:Regeneracion 1910.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Cover of ''[[Regeneración]]'', with portraits of the organizing board of PLM and European anarchists (1910)]]
The Mexican government and the press of the early 20th century called as ''magonistas'' people and groups who shared the ideas of the Flores Magón brothers, who inspired the overthrow of the dictatorship of [[Porfirio Díaz]] and performed an economic and political revolution. The fight against tyranny encouraged by the Flores Magón contravened official discourse of ''[[Porfiriato|Porfirian Peace]]'' by which the protesters were rated as the ''Revoltosos Magonistas'' (i.e. "Magonist rioters") to isolate any social basis and preserve the image of peace and progress imposed by force.&lt;ref&gt;National Archive of Mexico, Governance Branch: ''Revoltosos Magonistas'' (1906)&lt;/ref&gt;

Both of Flores Magón's brothers, like other members of the [[Mexican Liberal Party]] (PLM), used the term ''magonista''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxfordreference.com/search?q=Magonistas Magonistas] at [[Oxford University Press|Oxford Reference]]&lt;/ref&gt; to refer to the libertarian movement that promoted; as they felt they were fighting for an ideal and not to elevate in power to a boss or a group, they called themselves "liberals", as they were organized in the PLM, and later "anarchists". The same [[Ricardo Flores Magón]] affirmed: ''Liberal Party members are not magonistas, they are anarchists!''. In his literary work ''Verdugos y Víctimas'' (i.e. "Executioners and Victims"),&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon}} [http://www.archivomagon.net/ObrasCompletas/ObraLiteraria/Teatro/VerdugosVictimas/VerdugosVictimas.html ''Verdugos y Víctimas'' from the Ricardo Flores Magón Archive]&lt;/ref&gt; one of the characters responds indignantly when he was arrested and judged: ''I'm not a magonist, I am an anarchist. An anarchist has no idols.''

Magonist thinking was influenced by anarchist philosophers such as [[Mikhail Bakunin]] and [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], and others such as [[Élisée Reclus]], [[Charles Malato]], [[Errico Malatesta]], [[Anselmo Lorenzo]], [[Emma Goldman]], [[Fernando Tarrida del Mármol]] and [[Max Stirner]]. They were also influenced by the works of [[Karl Marx|Marx]], [[Maxim Gorky|Gorky]] and [[Henrik Ibsen|Ibsen]]. However, the most influential works were the ones of [[Peter Kropotkin]] ''[[The Conquest of Bread]]'' and ''[[Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution]]'', at the same time they were influenced by the Mexican liberal tradition of the 19th century and the self-government system of the [[Indigenous peoples of Mexico|indigenous people]].&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon}} [http://www.anarkismo.net/article/2494 Magonism; Historical Perspectives of a Mexican Anarchist Model]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Magonism and indigenous movement==
[[File:Magonistas en Tijuana.jpg|thumb|right|200px|''Magonistas'' in [[Tijuana]] in 1911]]
{{see also|Magonista rebellion of 1911}}
Indigenous peoples, since the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire|Spanish conquest of Mexico]],  searched to preserve the practice of [[direct democracy]], decision-making in [[Deliberative assembly|assembly]], rotation of administrative charges, the defense of communal property, [[Mutual aid (organization theory)|mutual aid]] as the community exploitation and rational use of [[natural resource]]s, shared anarchist principles raised by the magonists.&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon}} [https://web.archive.org/web/20080215020512/http://www.laneta.apc.org/magon/mymovind.htm Magonism and Indigenous Movement in Mexico]&lt;/ref&gt;

The direct influence of indigenous thought in magonism were the teachings of [[Teodoro Flores]],&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon}} [http://www.antorcha.net/biblioteca_virtual/politica/indio/lo_indio.html The Indian in the Magonist Movement]&lt;/ref&gt; [[mestizo]] [[Nahua peoples|Nahua]], father of the Flores Magón brothers, and the coexistence of other members of the PLM with indigenous groups during periods of organization and insurrection of PLM, between 1905 and 1910, such as the [[Popoluca]] in [[Veracruz, Veracruz|Veracruz]], the [[Yaqui people|Yaqui]] and [[Mayo people|Mayo]] in [[Sonora]], and the [[Cocopah people|Cocopah]] in [[Baja California]].

[[Fernando Palomares]], a Mayo indigenous, was one of the most active members of the Liberal Party who took part in the [[Cananea strike]] and [[Magonista rebellion of 1911|libertarian campaign of 1911]] in [[Mexicali]] and [[Tijuana]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://libcom.org/history/uprising-baja-california| title=The uprising in Baja California| publisher=Libcom.org/Organise| date=August 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.sandiegohistory.org/journal/99winter/magonista.htm| author=Lawrence D.

[[File:Ciudadano Flores Magon.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Citizen Year of Ricardo Flores Magón poster (1997)]]
After the end of the armed phase of [[Mexican Revolution]], and after the death of [[Ricardo Flores Magón]] in 1922, began the rescue of magonist thought, mainly due to trade unionists in Mexico and the United States. In the post-revolutionary Mexico, the figures of Flores Magón brothers was recollected by governments, considering them precursors of the revolution. Both the insurrection of 1910 as social rights enshrined in the [[Constitution of Mexico|Mexican Constitution of 1917]] was due largely to the ''magonistas'', which since 1906 took up arms and drafted an economic and social program.&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon}} [http://www.ordenjuridico.gob.mx/Constitucion/CH6.pdf Program of the PLM]&lt;/ref&gt;

However, although the demands that led to the revolution in theory were resolved in the Constitution and in the speeches of the revolutionary governments, there was no significant change in the lives of the most vulnerable populations. Also the ''magonistas'' considered not fighting to change the administrators of the state, but to abolish them. For this reason, the survived ''magonistas'' continued to spread anarchist propaganda. [[Librado Rivera]] was persecuted and imprisoned during the government of [[Plutarco Elías Calles]] and [[Enrique Flores Magón]], who believed that ''the Mexican social revolution is not yet over'',&lt;ref&gt;Enrique Flores Magón: ''Aclaraciones a la vida y obra de Ricardo Flores Magón'', La Protesta, Argentina, 30 March 1925&lt;/ref&gt; could enjoy security until the presidency of [[Lázaro Cárdenas]].

The [[Mexican Anarchist Federation]], founded in 1941 and active for about 40 years, edited the newspaper ''[[Regeneración]]'' and spread Magonist thought.

In the 1980s Magonism survived among some youth [[anarcho-punk]] groups. The ''Biblioteca Social Reconstruir'', founded in 1980 by the [[Spain|Spanish]] anarchist in exile [[Ricardo Mestre]] and located in [[Mexico City]], was a library where to find anarchist literature and works on Ricardo Flores Magón or copies of ''Regeneración''.&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon}} [http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2003/10/19/mas-molina.html Article about the ''Biblioteca Social Reconstruir'']&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, when the [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation]] (EZLN) took up arms in [[Chiapas]], claimed the ideas of the Flores Magón brothers. In 1997, indigenous organizations, social groups of libertarians and municipal councils of the state of [[Oaxaca]], declared the "Citizen Year of Ricardo Flores Magón" from 21 November (1997) to 16 September 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon}} [https://web.archive.org/web/20080509095210/http://www.laneta.apc.org/magon/razones.htm Article about the Citizen Year of Ricardo Flores Magón]&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2000, driven by indigenous organizations in the State of Oaxaca and libertarian groups in [[Mexico City]], the [[Magonistas Days]] (''Jornadas Magonistas'') were held for the 100 years of the founding of the newspaper ''[[Regeneración]]''. In the popular uprising of Oaxaca of 2006, took part organizations and youth groups also influenced by anarchist ''magonistas'' ideals.&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon}} [http://www.rebelion.org/noticia.php?id=52277 Anarchy and libertarian currents in the Oaxaca insurrectionary movement]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Massoud Foundation''' (founded as the '''Ahmad Shah Massoud Foundation'''; [[Dari (Persian dialect)|Dari Persian]]: {{lang|fa|بنیاد شهید احمد شاه مسعود}}) is a non-profit and non-governmental organization operating in [[Afghanistan]]. It was established in [[Kabul]] in 2003 to preserve and spread the values, leadership, and ideals of the late [[Ahmad Shah Massoud]], the '''Lion of the Panjshir,''' who was a founding father of the resistance against the Soviet invasion in the 1980s and then against the [[Taliban]] and [[Al-Qaeda]] in the 1990s until he was assassinated by Al-Qaeda just two days prior to 9/11.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.massoudhero.com/Biografie/biografie.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In Afghanistan, the Massoud Foundation has been involved in humanitarian and cultural efforts to improve the living standards of Afghan citizens, increase the literacy rate, and build schools, libraries, and computer labs. The Foundation funds [[Mandegar Daily]], an independent daily newspaper in Afghanistan&lt;ref&gt;http://www.elections.pajhwok.com/en/content/kabul-newspapers&lt;/ref&gt; that advocates for democracy, anti-terrorism, and for the elimination of government corruption and inefficiency. The Foundation has held numerous seminars and conferences in Kabul and London on anti-terrorism, democracy, education, and other political issues that the Afghan government is facing.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mandegardaily.com/%D8%A7%D8%B9%D9%84%D8%A7%D9%85%DB%8C%D9%87-%D8%A8%D9%86%DB%8C%D8%A7%D8%AF-%D8%B4%D9%87%DB%8C%D8%AF-%D8%A7%D8%AD%D9%85%D8%AF-%D8%B4%D8%A7%D9%87-%D9%85%D8%B3%D8%B9%D9%88%D8%AF-%D8%A8%D9%87-%D9%BE%DB%8C/د&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Meltwater''' is water released by the [[melting]] of [[snow]] or [[ice]], including [[glaciers|glacial ice]], tabular [[iceberg]]s and [[ice shelf|ice shelves]] over oceans. Meltwater is often found in the [[ablation zone]] of glaciers, where the rate of snow cover is reducing. Meltwater can be produced during [[volcanic eruptions]], in a similar way in which the more dangerous [[lahar]]s form.

When meltwater pools on the surface rather than flowing, it forms [[melt pond]]s. As the weather gets colder meltwater will often re-freeze. Meltwater can collect or melt under the ice's surface. These pools of water, known as [[subglacial lake]]s can form due to geothermal heat and friction.

==Water source==
{{Expand section|date=May 2008}}
Meltwater provides [[drinking water]] for a large proportion of the world's population, as well as providing water for [[irrigation]] and [[hydroelectricity|hydroelectric plants]].  Some cities around the world have large lakes that collect snow melt to supplement water supply. Cities that source water from meltwater include [[Melbourne]], [[Canberra]], [[Los Angeles]], [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]] amongst others.
{{see also|Water resources}}

==Glacial meltwater==
{{see also|Glacier ice accumulation}}
[[File:Fryxellsee Opt.jpg|thumb|right|Refrozen glacial meltwater from the [[Canada Glacier]], in Antarctica]] 
Glacial meltwater comes from glaciers that have receded over time. Often, there will be rivers flowing through glaciers into lakes. These brilliantly blue lakes get their color from "[[rock flour]]", [[sediment]] that has been transported through the rivers to the lakes. This sediment comes from rocks grinding together underneath the glacier. The fine [[Powder (substance)|powder]] is then suspended in the water and absorbs and scatters varying colors of [[sunlight]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Aas|first=Eyvind|last2=Bogen|first2=Jim|date=1988-04-01|title=Colors of glacier water|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/WR024i004p00561/abstract|journal=Water Resources Research|language=en|volume=24|issue=4|pages=561–565|doi=10.1029/WR024i004p00561|issn=1944-7973}}&lt;/ref&gt; giving a milky turquoise appearance.

[[File:Melting glacier (Skaftafellsjökull).jpg|thumb|Meltwater in Skaftafellsjökull, Iceland]]

Meltwater also acts as a [[lubricant]] in the [[basal sliding]] of glaciers. GPS measurements of ice flow have revealed that [[glacial motion|glacial movement]] is greatest in summer when the meltwater levels are highest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/content/goddard/like-butter-study-explains-surprising-acceleration-of-greenlands-inland-ice/|title='Like Butter': Study Explains Surprising Acceleration of Greenland's Inland Ice|last=Garner|first=Rob|date=2013-07-22|website=NASA|access-date=2016-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rapid changes==
Meltwater can be an indication of [[abrupt climate change]]. An instance of a large meltwater body is the case of the region of a tributary of Bindschadler Ice Stream, [[West Antarctica]] where rapid vertical motion of the ice sheet surface has suggested shifting of a subglacial water body. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Peters|first=Leo E.|last2=Anandakrishnan|first2=Sridhar|last3=Alley|first3=Richard B.|last4=Smith|first4=Andrew M.|date=2007-03-01|title=Extensive storage of basal meltwater in the onset region of a major West Antarctic ice stream|url=http://geology.geoscienceworld.org/content/35/3/251|journal=Geology|language=en|volume=35|issue=3|pages=251–254|doi=10.1130/G23222A.1|issn=0091-7613}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It can also destabilize glacial lakes leading to sudden [[flood]]s, and destabilize [[Snow#Snowpack|snowpack]] causing [[avalanche]]s.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unep.org/Documents.Multilingual/Default.asp?DocumentID=512&amp;ArticleID=5599&amp;l=en|title=Melting Ice—A Hot Topic? New UNEP Report Shows Just How Hot It's Getting|date=2007-06-04|website=United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP)|access-date=2016-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dammed glacial meltwater from a [[moraine-dammed lake]] that is released suddenly can result in the floods, such as those that created the granite chasms in [[Purgatory Chasm State Reservation]].

===Global warming===
In a report published in June 2007, the [[United Nations Environment Programme]] estimated that [[global warming]] could lead to 40% of the [[world population]] being affected by the loss of glaciers, snow and the associated meltwater in [[Asia]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Historically [[Meltwater pulse 1A]] was a prominent feature of the last deglaciation and took place 14.7-14.2 thousand years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Webster|first=Jody M.|last2=Clague|first2=David A.|last3=Riker-Coleman|first3=Kristin|last4=Gallup|first4=Christina|last5=Braga|first5=Juan C.|last6=Potts|first6=Donald|last7=Moore|first7=James G.|last8=Winterer|first8=Edward L.|last9=Paull|first9=Charles K.|title=Drowning of the −150 m reef off Hawaii: A casualty of global meltwater pulse 1A?|url=http://mr.crossref.org/iPage?doi=10.1130%2FG20170.1|journal=Geology|volume=32|issue=3|doi=10.1130/g20170.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until 1958, the ministry of national guidance dealt with the cultural affairs.&lt;ref name=jw&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Jessica Winegar|title=Culture is the Solution: The Civilizing Mission of Egypt’s Culture Palaces|journal=Romes|date=2009|volume=43|issue=2|url=http://www.anthropology.northwestern.edu/documents/people/Winegar7CultureIsTheSolution.pdf|accessdate=14 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ministry was established by [[President of Egypt|President]] [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] in 1958 under the name of the ministry of culture and national guidance.&lt;ref name=jw/&gt;&lt;ref name=mer&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Sonali Pahwa|author2=Jessica Winegar|title=Culture, State and Revolution|journal=MERIP|date=Summer 2012|volume=42|issue=263|url=http://www.merip.org/mer/mer263/culture-state-revolution|accessdate=14 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The French model was adopted by the establishment.&lt;ref name=mer/&gt;

The '''National Convention''' ([[Dutch language|Dutch]]: ''Nationale Conventie'', [[Afrikaans]]: ''Nasionale Konvensie''), also known as the '''Convention on the Closer Union of South Africa''' or the '''Closer Union Convention''', was a [[Constitutional convention (political custom)|constitutional convention]] held between 1908 and 1909 in [[Durban]] (12 October to 5 November 1908), [[Cape Town]] (23 November to 18 December 1908, 11 January to 3 February 1909) and [[Bloemfontein]] (3 May to 11 May 1909).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Minutes of Proceedings with Annexures (Selected) of the South African National Convention held at Durban, Cape Town and Bloemfontein, 12th October, 1908, to 11th May, 1909|last=|first=|publisher=Cape Times Limited Government Printers|year=1910|isbn=|location=Cape Town|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The convention led to the adoption of the [[South Africa Act 1909|South Africa Act]] by the [[British parliament|British Parliament]] and thus to the creation of the [[Union of South Africa]]. The four colonies of the area that would become South Africa - the [[Cape Colony]], [[Natal Colony]], the [[Orange River Colony]] and the [[Transvaal Colony]] - were represented at the convention, along with a delegation from [[Company rule in Rhodesia|Rhodesia]]. There were 33 delegates in total, with the Cape being represented by 12, the Transvaal eight, the Orange River five, Natal five, and Rhodesia three.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The South African Constitution|last=May|first=Henry John|publisher=Juta &amp; Co. Limited|year=1955|isbn=|location=Cape Town|pages=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The convention was held behind closed doors, in the fear that a public affair would lead delegates to refuse compromising on contentious areas of disagreement. All the delegates were [[White South Africans|white]] men, a third of them were farmers, ten were [[lawyer]]s, and some were [[academics]]. Two-thirds had fought on both sides of the [[Second Boer War]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The South African Constitution|last=May|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of the convention, the delegates had drawn up a constitution that would, subject to some amendments by the British government, become the South Africa Act, which was South Africa's constitution between 1910 and 1961, when the country became a [[South Africa|republic]] under the [[South African Constitution of 1961|Constitution of 1961]].

== Background ==
The first attempt to establish a union of the colonies of Southern Africa was in 1858, when [[Burgher (Boer republics)|burghers]] of the [[Orange Free State]] sent a petition to [[Sir George Grey]], the then [[Governor of the Cape Colony]], requesting the formation of a "compact union" including the Free State, the Cape, and Natal (but excluding the Transvaal). The [[Volksraad (Orange Free State)|Volksraad]] of the Orange Free State followed up the petition with a [[Resolution (law)|resolution]] requesting the [[State President of the Orange Free State|State President]], [[Jacobus Nicolaas Boshoff]], to communicate with Grey and proposing a conference. When Grey communicated this to the [[Secretary of State for the Colonies|Colonial Secretary]], [[Edward Bulwer-Lytton]] in [[London]], Lytton replied that the [[Government of the United Kingdom|British government]] was not prepared to resume [[sovereignty]] over the Free State, which it had previously controlled as the [[Orange River Sovereignty]] between 1848 and 1854.

In 1871, the [[Cape Parliament|Cape House of Assembly]] passed a resolution approving of the idea of union, and in 1872 the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] similarly resolved that it would be "desirable" for a [[confederation]] between the colonies and republics of South Africa to be established. In 1874, [[Henry Herbert, 4th Earl of Carnarvon|Lord Henry Carnarvon]], who had introduced the [[British North America Act (1867)|British North America Act]], sent [[James Anthony Froude]] to report on the situation in the region. Froude's presence was, however, resented, due to the South Africans' desire "that union should come from within, not dictated by [[Downing Street]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The South African Constitution|last=May|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Froude's report led to the British Parliament passing the South Africa Act, 1877, "for the Union under one Government of such of the South African Colonies and States as may agree thereto". It would have modeled the South African union on the [[Canadian Confederation|Canadian model]], but "South Africa had hardly been consulted" in its promulgation and no Cape parliamentarians were willing to sponsor it locally.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The South African Constitution|last=May|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=4–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Act expired in August 1882, without being implemented.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://api.parliament.uk/historic-hansard/commons/1882/jul/20/the-south-africa-act-1877-renewal#S3V0272P0_18820720_HOC_37|title=THE SOUTH AFRICA ACT, 1877— RENEWAL. (Hansard, 20 July 1882)|website=api.parliament.uk|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[First Boer War]] (1880 to 1881) intervened in the journey toward union, and it was not until 1889 when a [[Southern African Customs Union|customs union]] was formed between the Cape and the Free State, which were joined in 1899 by the other territories with the exception of the Transvaal. The Second Boer War (1899 to 1902), which the British won, led to the formerly-independent [[Boer Republics|Boer republics]] becoming British colonies. The customs union was renewed in 1903, now including the Transvaal.

In 1907, the [[High Commissioner for Southern Africa]], [[William Palmer, 2nd Earl of Selborne|Lord William Selborne]] was tasked with preparing a report on the disunion of the colonies, titled ''Review of the Present Mutual Relations of the British South African Colonies,'' described as an equivalent of the [[Report on the Affairs of British North America|Durham Report]]. The report regarded the disunion in the region as artificial, and noted the shared "[[Black South African|Native]] problem" and fiscal and economic matters. At this time the white population of the four colonies stood at around one million, with natives numbering five million. 

In May 1908, the Intercolonial Customs and Railways Conference met to discuss the issue of union as well as railway and customs.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Frederick Robert Moor, Prime Minister of Natal, was chosen as chairman of the conference. Each of the four self-governing colonies had three representatives: [[John Xavier Merriman]], [[Jacobus Wilhelmus Sauer]], and [[Francois Stephanus Malan]] representing the Cape Colony; Moor, Charles O'Grady Gubbins, and Charles Hitchins representing the Natal Colony; [[Louis Botha]], [[Jan Christiaan Smuts]], and [[Henry Charles Hull]] representing the Transvaal Colony; and [[Abraham Fischer]], [[James Barry Munnik|James Barry Munnik Hertzog]], and [[:af:Alfred_Ernest_William_Ramsbottom|Alfred Ernest William Ramsbottom]] [af] representing the Orange River Colony. Rhodesia and the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] province of [[province of Mozambique]] participated on the understanding that their delegates could not vote on or discuss anything that did not concern their territories directly or which they were not legally competent to address. Lewis Loyd Mitchell, [[Francis James Newton]], and EC Baxter represented Rhodesia; and TAG Rosado and BM d'Almeida represented Mozambique.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Unification of South Africa|last=Thompson|first=LM|publisher=Claredon Press|year=1961|isbn=|location=Oxford|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|84-90}} The conference unanimously accepted Smuts' motions, which read as follows:&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;{{Rp|91-92}}&lt;blockquote&gt;"(a) That in the opinion of this Conference the best interests and the permanent prosperity of South Africa can only be secured by an early union, under the Crown of Great Britain, of the several self-governing Colonies;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;(b) that to the union contemplated in the foregoing resolution Rhodesia shall be entitled to admission at such time and on such conditions as may hereafter be agreed upon;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;(c) that the members of this Conference agree to submit the foregoing resolutions to the Legislatures of their respective Colonies, and to take such steps as may be necessary to obtain their consent to the appointment of delegates to a National South African Convention, whose object shall be to consider and report on the most desirable form of South African Union and to prepare a draft constitution;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;(d) the Convention shall consist of not more than (12) twelve delegates from the Cape Colony, not more than (8) eight delegates from the Transvaal, not more than (5) five delegates from Natal and the Orange River Colony respectively, and it shall meet as soon as convenient after the next Sessions of all the Parliaments; provided that as soon as at least two Colonies shall have appointed their delegates the Convention shall be considered as constituted;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;(e) the Convention shall publish the draft constitution as soon as possible, and shall, in consultation with the Governments of the self-governing Colonies, determine the further steps to be taken in reference thereto;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;(f) in the Convention the voting shall be ''per capita'' and not by States. A Chairman shall be elected from the members who shall have the right of speaking and voting, and in the event of an equality of votes shall have a casting vote."&lt;/blockquote&gt;At this time public opinion was in favor of a union between the colonies, with the business community and especially the [[Mining in South Africa|mining houses]] being convinced of the financial and economic benefits union might entail. Disunion was widely blamed as a cause of much of the region's social and economic woes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The Closer Union Society was founded in Cape Town in mid-1908, with former Cape prime minister [[William Philip Schreiner]] as its president. The Society's aim was "to encourage the formation of similar societies throughout Cape Colony and South Africa and to disseminate information on all aspects and systems of closer Union", with several closer union societies being established across the colonies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kennedy Ross|first=Barrie|date=1950|title=A Study of Politics in the Cape Colony from January 1908 to May 1910|url=https://open.uct.ac.za/bitstream/item/16866/thesis_hum_1950_ross_barry_kennedy.pdf?sequence=1|journal=Master of Arts in History thesis|volume=|pages=72–73|via=University of Cape Town}}&lt;/ref&gt; It published ''The Framework of Union'' in 1908 which explained the constitutional structures of the [[United States]], Canada, [[Australia]], [[Germany]] and [[Switzerland]], with a view to propagate the idea of union among South Africans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Mechanism of the Modern State: A Treatise on the Science and Art of Government|last=Marriott|first=John Arthur Ransome|publisher=Clarendon Press|year=1927|isbn=|location=Oxford|pages=279}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mahatma Gandhi]] spoke at an event of the Transvaal Closer Union Society on the topic of immigration law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://lib.bjplibrary.org/jspui/bitstream/123456789/580/1/THE%20COLLECTED%20WORKS%20OF%20MAHATMA%20GANDHI%20-%20VOL%20%289%29.PDF|title=The Collected Works of Mahatma Gandhi|last=Gandhi|first=Mohandas Karamchand|publisher=CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform|year=2015|isbn=1508520437|volume=9|location=|pages=77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}
The main areas of contention at the National Convention were the following, with the first three being the most controversial:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The South African Constitution|last=May|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=7–15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Whether South Africa would be a [[federation]] or a [[unitary state]].
* What the [[Suffrage|franchise]] of the new union would be, with particular regard to the status of the black and [[Coloured South African|coloured]] races.
* How South Africa would be divided into [[administrative division]]s, especially the [[Provinces of South Africa|provinces]].
* The status of the two dominant European languages, [[Dutch language|Dutch]] (later [[Afrikaans]]) and [[South African English|English]].
* Where the [[capital city]] would be located.

The convention adopted equality between Dutch and English, with both becoming official languages of the new South Africa. It was also decided that South Africa would have three capitals: Cape Town would host the national Parliament, Pretoria would host the civil service, and the apex court would be located in Bloemfontein. Natal's consolation prize was securing a lucrative railway agreement for which it had been pressing since 1903.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Federal or unitary? ===
Leading up to the convention, most sought a federal dispensation. The Transvaal delegation was concerned that the Transvaal would ultimately be financially responsible for all the other provinces, given that its "treasury was full and overflowing, and the treasuries of the other three colonies were empty, faced with the problem of balancing their budgets".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Natal and the Orange River feared that, because they were the two smaller territories, the voting power of the Cape and the Transvaal would negate their representation. Natal, having been predominantly English among its white inhabitants and being the most fervent supporter of federalism, specifically feared that a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] culture and language culture would be forced upon it. The Cape sought to protect the [[Cape Qualified Franchise|qualified franchise]] it had adopted which allowed black and coloureds to stand for elections and vote.

Jan Smuts was the primary sponsor of the idea that South Africa should be a unitary state. He criticized the [[Constitution of the United States|American federal model]] as "ineffective for the essential purpose of civilized government" because individual states could make their own law, and South Africa had by that time already experienced too much legislative confusion, in Smuts' view. A strict federal model could also not respond quickly enough to pressing issues. Smuts also regarded Canadian federalism as emphasizing the jealousies and differences of race and religion, and felt [[Australia]]n federalism led to too much friction between the states. Smuts believed that a unitary state would allow South Africans to overcome the friction and racial strife they had thereinto experienced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The South African Constitution|last=May|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

But it was mainly the question of a national native policy that decided the issue, with the "unifiers" arguing that a strong central government would be necessary for dealing with this problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The South African Constitution|last=May|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; South Africa thus became a unitary state with a single central Parliament that has "[[Parliamentary sovereignty|unlimited legislative authority]]". Given this parliamentary sovereignty, the constitution itself could be amended with a simple majority of both houses of Parliament, with the potential exception of two "entrenched" clauses governing the equality of languages and the qualified franchise in the Cape.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://archive.spectator.co.uk/article/13th-february-1909/5/the-south-african-constitution|title=THE SOUTH AFRICAN CONSTITUTION. » 13 Feb 1909 » The Spectator Archive|work=The Spectator Archive|access-date=2018-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Franchise ===
Before unification, each of the four colonies that would become South Africa had their own franchise policy. The Cape had a franchise qualified by property and wages. By the time of the convention, there were 22,784 black and coloured voters in the Cape, out of a total electorate of 152,221. Natal had a similar policy, having had 200 black and coloured voters on the roll out of a total electorate of 22,686. In the Transvaal and Orange River, only white men could vote or stand for election.

Four potential solutions to the franchise problem were tabled at the convention:

* The Cape qualified franchise would be extended to all of South Africa.
* A standardized "civilization test" would be adopted for all voters.
* A single "colour-line" franchise, such as in the Transvaal and Orange River, would be adopted for all of South Africa.
* The Cape qualified franchise would be left alone, but the future [[Parliament of South Africa|Union Parliament]] would be allowed to decide the matter in the future.

A standardized "civilization test" would have meant legal equality between whites, blacks and coloureds in South Africa, which was unacceptable to the conservative electorate in the Transvaal, Orange River and Natal. Furthermore, neither the Cape nor the two former Boer republics were willing to compromise on their respective franchise systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The South African Constitution|last=May|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to the fourth option being adopted, with the Cape qualified franchise receiving constitutional protection in section 35 of the South Africa Act until such a time as it is amended by a joint sitting of Parliament with a supporting vote of two-thirds of the members.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The South African Constitution|last=May|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; This victory for the Cape delegation did however not extend to the ability of blacks and coloureds to sit in Parliament or provincial councils. While they could thus continue to vote in the Cape, blacks and coloureds could no longer be elected to legislative office.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The South African Constitution|last=May|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Administrative divisions ===
As South Africa was to be a unitary rather than a federal state, the provinces would have no legislatures of their own, but instead a system of provincial councils wholly subordinate to the national Parliament. No conflict would thus be possible between the councils and Parliament, as the provinces had no exclusive powers - only those assigned to them by the sovereign legislature.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

In their desire to keep the [[Provincial council (South Africa)|provincial council]] non-partisan, the delegates sought to model it largely on that of Switzerland. In this regard, choosing the executive committee of the council was made to be through [[proportional representation]], with the executive Administrator of each province being independently appointed.

Education was one of the key areas of jurisdiction added to the provincial council system, primarily for the fears raised by Natal and the Orange River that their language rights would be undermined. Their own provincial councils could thus set provincial language standards in education.

This desire for non-partisanship did not come to fruition, however, as every provincial election since the adoption of the South Africa Act would be fought along party political lines.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The South African Constitution|last=May|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Adoption ==

No such objection would exist to an Imperial Parliament Act.

After the draft constitution was formulated, it was tabled before the respective colonial legislatures for approval. [[Stephen Leacock]] wrote that its acceptance in the Transvaal was a foregone conclusion, as the dominant political parties in the legislature had both agreed to the constitution beforehand. The Cape Parliament, on the other hand, did propose some amendments, including the scrapping of the proportional representation system as adopted at the convention, the scrapping of which the Orange River Colony agreed with. Leacock continues:&lt;blockquote&gt;"In Natal, which as an ultra-British and ultra-loyal colony, was generally supposed to be in fear of union, many amendments were offered. The convention then met again at Bloemfontein, made certain changes in the draft of the constitution, and again submitted the document to the colonies. This time it was accepted. Only in Natal was it thought necessary to take a popular vote, and here, contrary to expectation, the people voted heavily in favor of union."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://historyweblog.com/2015/06/conflicts-of-interests-in-s-african/|title=Conflicts of Interests in S African Union|date=2015-06-03|work=History Moments|access-date=2018-06-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The Cape submitted 12 amendments, Natal 17 (in another attempt to secure a federal arrangement), and the Orange River three. 40 amendments were subsequently made by the convention between 3 and 11 May 1909 in Bloemfontein.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The South African Constitution|last=May|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final approval by the colonial governments happened between May and June. The Natal referendum returned 11,121 votes in favor of the draft constitution and 3,701 against.

The various colonial governments, after having approved the draft, agreed with the resolution taken at the convention that the constitution be referred to the British Parliament&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; for adoption, in which would become the [[South Africa Act 1909|South Africa Act]]. Each colonial legislature appointed delegates to go to London, empowered to agree to changes "not inconsistent with the provisions and principles of the draft act".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Minutes of the National Convention|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=355–359}}&lt;/ref&gt; In London, 53 amendments were made to the bill, most of which were procedural and not substantive, and Parliament passed the constitution in essentially the same form it had been submitted by the National Convention. It received royal assent on 20 September 1909 and the Union of South Africa came into being on 31 May 1910, "exactly eight years to the day on which the [[Peace of Vereeniging]] was signed".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The South African Constitution|last=May|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legacy ==
The decision of the National Convention to choose a unitary rather than a federal framework under a regime of [[parliamentary sovereignty]] led to the central government, and moreover the central Parliament, not having a specified list of enumerated powers, instead being able to govern essentially as it pleased over the whole of the country. This led to [[Afrikaners]] fearing language inequality in the years after the constitution was adopted, despite the equality provisions in the South Africa Act. In turn, this would partly cause Hertzog to establish the [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]] in 1912. It also led to the "flag controversy" of 1926 and 1927, and the imposition of racial [[apartheid]] by the National Party from [[South African general election, 1948|1948]] onward.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The South African Constitution|last=May|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=9–10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

That the South Africa Act was enacted by the British Parliament also led to controversy in later years, with some arguing that the constitution was "foisted on South Africa by a foreign parliament".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The South African Constitution|last=May|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1951, the National Party introduced the [[Separate Representation of Voters Act, 1951|Separate Representation of Voters Act]], which intended to remove coloured voters from the [[voters' roll]]. Because Parliament was legally sovereign, and because the [[Statute of Westminster 1931|Statute of Westminster]] had already come into effect, government felt it was lawful to change the entrenched clauses without adhering to the requirements of the South Africa Act (i.e. both houses of Parliament must sit jointly and pass an amendment with a two-thirds majority). The Separate Representation of Voters Act thus passed without the requisite two-thirds majority required, and without both houses sitting together, to amend the Cape qualified franchise, plunging South Africa into a [[Coloured vote constitutional crisis|constitutional crisis]] that would continue until 1955.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The South African Constitution|last=May|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Convention for a Democratic South Africa]] (Codesa), which transpired between 1991 and 1993 and led to the end of the apartheid system, was the second constitutional convention that occurred in South Africa to draft a new constitution. It led to the adoption of the [[Interim Constitution (South Africa)|1993 "interim" Constitution]], and at the same time the end of the parliamentary sovereignty that had started in 1910 when the South Africa Act came into being.

'''[[Nationalism#Sports nationalism|Nationalism]] and [[sport]]''' are often intertwined, as sports provide a venue for symbolic competition between nations; sports competition often reflects national conflict, and in fact has often been a tool of diplomacy. The involvement of political goals in sport is seen by some as contrary to the fundamental [[ethos of sport]] being carried on for its own sake, for the enjoyment of its participants, but this involvement has been true throughout the [[history of sport]].&lt;ref&gt;Grant Jarvie, ''Sport, culture and society: an introduction'' (2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

Most sports are contested between national teams, which encourages the use of sporting events for nationalist purposes, whether intentionally or not. The signaling of national solidarity through sport is one of the primary forms of [[banal nationalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Xypolia|first=Ilia|title=More than just a Game: football as the modern opium of the masses|journal=London Progressive Journal|date=June 2012|url=http://londonprogressivejournal.com/article/view/1167|accessdate=14 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several sporting events are a matter of national pride; [[The Ashes]] is a matter of national pride between England and Australia. Also in [[cricket]] an [[India versus Pakistan cricket rivalry|India versus Pakistan]] match puts both countries on a virtual standstill as if it were all about national pride during those matches.

The [[Olympic Games]] are the premier stage for nationalist competition, and its history reflects the history of political conflict since its inception at the end of the 19th century. The [[1936 Summer Olympics]] held in Berlin was an illustration, maybe best acknowledged in hindsight, where an ideology was developing which used the event to strengthen its spread through propaganda.  The boycott by the [[United States]] and politically aligned nations of the [[1980 Summer Olympics]] and the [[Soviet Union]] and politically aligned nations of the [[1984 Summer Olympics]] were part of the [[Cold War]] conflict.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher R. Hill, "The cold war and the Olympic movement." ''History Today'' 49.1 (1999): 19+ &lt;/ref&gt;

When [[apartheid]] was the official policy in South Africa, many sportspeople adopted the conscientious approach that they should not appear in competitive sports there. Some feel this was an effective contribution to the eventual demolition of the policy of apartheid, others feel that it may have prolonged and reinforced its worst effects. Many African nations boycotted the [[1976 Summer Olympics]] in [[Montreal]], as a result of then New Zealand Prime Minister [[Rob Muldoon]] allowing the All Blacks to tour South Africa. The issue would later come to a head during the [[1981 Springbok Tour]].&lt;ref&gt;Douglas Booth,  "Hitting apartheid for six? The politics of the South African sports boycott." ''Journal of Contemporary History'' 38.3 (2003): 477-493.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[George Orwell]]'s essay "The Sporting Spirit"[http://orwell.ru/library/articles/spirit/english/e_spirit] examines the effect nationalism plays on sport, where Orwell argues that various sporting events trigger violence between groups for the very reason of competition.

== Nationalist sports ==

In the [[history of Ireland]], [[Gaelic games|Gaelic sports]] were clearly carried on with nationalist overtones: for example, for most of the last century a person could have been banned from playing [[Gaelic football]], [[hurling]], or other sport, if the person was seen to have played [[Association football]], [[cricket]], [[Rugby football|rugby]] or any other game which was of British origin.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick F. McDevitt, "Muscular Catholicism: Nationalism, masculinity and Gaelic team sports, 1884–1916." ''Gender &amp; History'' 9.2 (1997): 262-284.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mike Cronin,  "Fighting for Ireland, playing for England? The nationalist history of the gaelic athletic association and the English influence on Irish sport." ''International Journal of the History of Sport'' 15.3 (1998): 36-56.&lt;/ref&gt;

The nationalistic Italian fascists also created [[Volata]] as their own home-grown alternative to soccer and rugby. It was intended to be a replacement for the popular games perceived to be of British origin that would be of a more local character, tracing its heritage back to the earlier Italian games of [[Harpastum]] and [[Calcio Fiorentino]]. However, unlike its Gaelic equivalents, Volata was short-lived and is no longer played.&lt;ref&gt;''Making the Rugby World: Race, Gender, Commerce'' edited by Timothy J L Chandler and John Nauright ({{ISBN|0-7146-4853-1}}). See especially pages 92-94.[https://books.google.com/books?ie=UTF-8&amp;vid=ISBN0714648531&amp;id=bT4R23yidcEC&amp;dq=volata&amp;pg=PP1&amp;printsec=0&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;sig=S-Ow7exL5UdLjL-x0PxYFVvs2hc]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Clubs as symbols of rival communities ==

In [[Scotland]], the [[Old Firm]] derby in [[Glasgow]] featuring [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]], historically linked to the city's Catholic community, and [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]], similarly linked to the city's Protestant community, have also historically seen trends along religio-political lines.

April 11, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; In the same vein, [[FC Barcelona]] have since the late 1990s promoted from youth ranks a series of Catalan players such as [[Xavi]] and [[Carles Puyol]]. Indeed, the club is widely seen as the de facto representative of [[Catalonia]], extending the [[Autonomous Community]]'s reach to areas it otherwise would not be able to influence.

In Canada, the [[Montreal Canadiens]], the world's oldest and most successful professional ice hockey team, has always been a symbol for [[Francophone Quebeckers]] in [[Montreal]].  The teams has had rivalries in succession with the [[Anlgophone Quebec]]'s [[Montreal Wanderers]] and [[Montreal Maroons]], as well as English Canada's [[Canadiens–Maple Leafs rivalry|Toronto Maple Leafs]].  As well, from 1975 to 1995 there was a rivalry with the [[Battle of Quebec (ice hockey)|Quebec Nordiques]] from [[Quebec City]], which took on political overtones, with Canadiens fans being more likely to be [[Quebec Liberal Party|Liberals]] and [[Quebec federalism|federalists]], and Nordiques fans more likely [[Pequist]]s and [[Quebec sovereigntist|sovereigntists]].

'''Pathology Messaging Implementation Project''' ('''PMIP''') is the project that introduced universal delivery of electronic pathology results to GPs in Great Britain. The standard used by the British [[National Health Service]] (NHS) to transmit [[pathology]] orders and pathology test results currently uses UN-EDIFACT based messages.

PMIP began in the United Kingdom as the PMEP (Pathology Messaging Enabling Project) under the control of the NHS Information Authority and was supported by the Royal College of Pathologists (Dr Rick Jones), the Royal College of GPs (Dr Stephen Pill) and the [[British Medical Association]]. PMIP was designed for the transmission of structured pathology orders and their associated results between pathology and primary care systems. Messages are encapsulated in [[EDIFACT]] rather than [[XML]] as this work had already been done.

Originally messages were to be encrypted end-to-end (organisation-to-organisation) using [[public key infrastructure]] (PKI). The NHS subsequently moved to an alternative strategy using Data Transfer Service (DTS). Messages are encrypted from the pathology laboratory to the DTS server, and again from the DTS server to the [[General Practitioner]] using the PMIP interim messaging cryptographic service. The DTS provides application-to-application messaging within the NHS as well as providing a replacement for the [[X.400]] service. It also provides easier development capability for the system suppliers at each end site.

All pathology tests and profiles are coded with [[Read code|Read Codes]] which had initially been developed by a General Practitioner, James Read, to describe all aspects of healthcare for his own use. These codes were subsequently adopted by the NHS. A subset, known as the Bounded Code List (BCL), was developed specifically for this project. Read Codes have been subsumed into Clinical Terms (CT), which is an enhancement of the American [[SNOMED]] (Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine) classification scheme.

The electronic delivery of test results from clinical laboratories to clinical users is rightly seen as a service that can provide clinical benefit by speeding up diagnostic processes and ensuring accurate and timely delivery of critical clinical information. Such electronic transfers were begun in the UK and Europe in the early 1990s using ad hoc message standards. In the mid-1990s the NHS in the UK took the bold step of making this a universal feature of result delivery to general practice (GPs) and embarked on two linked projects to achieve this. In the first, the Pathology Messaging Enabler Project, standards were defined and infrastructure installed to link 200 laboratory systems to 8,500 GP systems. In the second project, the Pathology Messaging Implementation Project, these standards and the associated software was rolled out. By 2004 more than 35 million results messages were being transmitted each year and in 2007 some 50 million such messages were safely and securely delivered.

A '''peace feeler''' is, in [[diplomacy]], a means of determining whether a warring party is prepared to end hostilities. [[William Safire]] defines it as "a diplomatic probe, real or imagined, to end hostilities."&lt;ref&gt;Safire's Political Dictionary, p. 528&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Hazara people}}
The [[Hazara people|Hazara]] community in [[Quetta]], in [[Pakistan]], has been the target of [[persecution]] and violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://samaa.tv/newsdetail.aspx?ID=37032&amp;CID=1|title=International commission demanded to probe Hazara killings|publisher=Samaa News|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111029183755/http://samaa.tv/newsdetail.aspx?ID=37032&amp;CID=1|archivedate=October 29, 2011|deadurl=yes|accessdate=April 2, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefridaytimes.com/beta2/tft/article.php?issue=20120302&amp;page=5.1|title=Insight: A brief history of Hazara persecution|publisher=The Friday Times|accessdate=April 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Pakistani Sunni Muslim extremist militant group, [[Lashkar-e-Jhangvi]], is assumed to be behind the attacks against Hazaras.

Hazaras have been living in Pakistan before partition since 1880s. Almost all migrated due to persecution by [[Abdur Rahman Khan|Emir Abdul Rahman Khan]] and a small part in 1990's due to ethnic cleansing by the Afghan Taliban. The Hazaras are mainly [[Shia Islam|Shiite]] Muslims, a minority in [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]]-dominated Pakistan. Their ethnicity is easily identifiable due to their physical features.&lt;ref name="Deserving of death" /&gt;

== Perpetrators ==
Acts of violence involving Sunni Muslims and their Shia counterparts in Pakistan have been evident since the 1980s. They are generally considered to have arisen from attempts by the then national leader, [[Zia ul-Haq]], to legitimise his [[military dictatorship]] and from the influx of weapons into the country following the [[Soviet invasion of Afghanistan]]. Although the perpetrators often do not claim responsibility for the attacks, expert analysis suggests that in recent times it is the Sunnis who are dominating the aggression and that they are motivated by the ideology of [[Al-Qaeda]].&lt;ref name="BBC20111004"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-south-asia-12278919|title=Pakistan's evolving sectarian schism|last=Lawson|first=Alastair|date=4 October 2011|accessdate=22 November 2012|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Quetta, which is the capital of the Pakistani province of Balochistan, has seen numerous of these violent incidents. This is in part because of a separatist movement involving militants from the ethnic minority who desire greater autonomy and also because the Pakistani military is engaged in counter-insurgency operations near to the province's border with Afghanistan, where there is tribal strife that involves the Taliban and allied groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-20425510|title=Taliban bomber kills Pakistan Shia marchers|date=22 November 2012|accessdate=22 November 2012|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is widely assumed that the Al-Qaeda-affiliated Sunni Muslim [[Extremist Groups|extremist militant group]], Lashkar-e-Jhangvi (LeJ) and Sipah-e-Sahaba, is behind the attacks on the Hazara community in the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurasiareview.com/26092011-pakistan-another-massacre-of-hazaras-in-balochistan-by-pro-al-qaeda-elements-analysis/|title=Pakistan: Another Massacre of Hazaras in Balochistan By Pro Al Qaeda Elements|author=B.

==Background==
{{Further|Indian MRCA competition}}
On 31 January 2012, Indian Ministry of Defence announced that [[Dassault Rafale]] had won the [[Indian MRCA competition|MMRCA]] competition to supply Indian Air Force with 126 aircraft along with an option for 63 additional aircraft. The first 18 aircraft were to be supplied by [[Dassault Aviation]] fully built and the remaining 108 aircraft were to be [[Licensed production|manufactured under license]] by [[Hindustan Aeronautics Limited]] (HAL) with transfer of technology from Dassault. Rafale was chosen as the lowest bidder based on life-cycle cost, which is a combination of cost of acquisition, operating cost over a duration of 40 years and cost of transfer of technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Pandit |first1=Rajat |title=French jet Rafale bags $20bn IAF fighter order; India 'briefs' losing European countries|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/French-jet-Rafale-bags-20bn-IAF-fighter-order-India-briefs-losing-European-countries/articleshow/11706551.cms |work=The Times of India |date=1 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The negotiations with Dassault dragged on over disagreements on warranty for aircraft produced by HAL. India wanted Dassault to ensure the quality of aircraft produced by HAL, but Dassault refused to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Prusty |first1=Nigam |last2=Kotoky |first2=Anurag |title=Government's $15 billion Rafale deal faces delays: sources |url=https://in.reuters.com/article/india-rafale-deal/governments-15-billion-rafale-deal-faces-delays-sources-idINDEE93403Z20130405 |work=Reuters |date=5 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Datt |first1=Gautam |title=HAL's poor track record overshadows IAF plans to buy 126 Dassault Rafale jets |url=https://www.indiatoday.in/india/north/story/rafale-jets-hal-hindustan-aeronautics-limited-iaf-dassault-aviation-158290-2013-04-05 |work=India Today |date=5 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2014, it was reported that the cost of the deal had escalated to $30 billion, with each aircraft costing $120 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Sagar |first1=Pradip R |title=dna exclusive: 100% price escalation on Rafale fighter aircraft to Rs 1.75 lakh crore likely to dent IAF's strike capability |url=https://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-dna-exclusive-100-price-escalation-on-rafale-fighter-aircraft-to-rs-175-lakh-crore-likely-to-dent-iaf-s-strike-capability-1957107 |work=Daily News and Analysis |date=26 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2014, defence minister [[A.

The agreement included a 50% "offset clause", which requires the companies involved in the agreement to invest 50% of the contract value back into India.

==Allegations==
The day after the signing of IGA between France and India, [[Indian National Congress]] spokesperson [[Manish Tewari]] asked for details of the agreement to be made public and questioned if there was an escalation of per-aircraft cost from {{INR|715}} [[crore]] to {{INR|1600}} crore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Cong critical of Rafale deal, wants contract to be made public |url=https://www.deccanherald.com/content/572223/cong-critical-rafale-deal-wants.html |work=Deccan Herald |agency=Press Trust of India |date=24 September 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2017, Congress alleged that procurement procedures were bypassed in acquisition of Rafale and questioned the presence of [[Anil Ambani]] in France during Modi's announcement to acquire 36 fully built aircraft. Congress leader [[Randeep Surjewala]] also alleged that HAL was bypassed in Rafale contract and questioned if there was an escalation of per-aircraft cost from {{INR|526.1}} crore to {{INR|1570}} crore.

He added that the agreement for 36 aircraft was cheaper than the previous proposal and had a better maintenance and weapons package. He said that most of the confusion over cost was due to comparison of prices from different base years and comparison of different deliverables. Elaborating on the differences between the IGA and the proposed acquisition under MMRCA tender, he said that the new agreement had provisions for training, a better performance-based logistics package and two aircraft maintenance and overhaul facilities that were not present in the original proposal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Diwakar |title=‘Contract for 36 Rafales include weapons suite superior to the earlier case … higher capability more apt for IAF’ |url=https://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/the-interviews-blog/contract-for-36-rafales-include-weapons-suite-superior-to-the-earlier-case-higher-capability-more-apt-for-iaf/ |work=The Times of India Blogs |date=13 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a controversy that has been ongoing for sometime, allegations in the controversy have resulted in a public incident in the [[Parliament of India]] during  a no-confidence motion debate on 21 July 2018. [[Rahul Gandhi]], president of the main opposition party, Indian National Congress, made what has been described as bold and direct accusations toward the [[Prime Minister of India]], [[Narendra Modi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.financialexpress.com/india-news/no-confidence-motion-modi-government-lying-on-rafale-says-rahul-gandhi-pm-rejects-charges/1252650/|title=No-Confidence Motion: Modi government lying on Rafale, says Rahul Gandhi; PM rejects&amp;nbsp;charges|date=2018-07-21|work=The Financial Express|access-date=2018-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prime minister dismissed the allegations as the program's interactions are between the governments of India and France, without any middlemen. Both governments have then officially refuted the charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.firstpost.com/politics/no-confidence-motion-dripping-sarcasm-narendra-modi-gives-rahul-gandhi-a-lesson-in-oratory-as-nda-wins-trust-vote-4786601.html|title=No-confidence motion: Dripping sarcasm, Narendra Modi gives Rahul Gandhi oratory lesson as NDA sails through - Firstpost|website=www.firstpost.com|access-date=2018-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/modi-no-confidence-motion-speech-highlights-point-lok-sabha-1291855-2018-07-21|title='Childish behaviour' and other things Modi said in Lok Sabha: 10 points|website=India Today|access-date=2018-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Indian National Congress directly blames the Indian Government led by Narendra Modi for overlooking the capabilities of government-owned [[Hindustan Aeronautics Limited]] (HAL) in favour of Reliance Defence for the offset deal with Dassault.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://newscentral24x7.com/hal-rafale-deal-nirmala-sitharaman-former-chief-ts-raju/|title=HAL has the capability to build Rafael jets in India, says former HAL chief TS Raju|website=www.newscentral24x7.com |access-date=2018-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indian defence minister Nirmala Sitharaman rejected these charges by saying that " Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) was dropped from the jet deal by the previous UPA regime after French manufacturer Dassault Aviation and the state-owned entity failed to agree on production terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=toi |title=toi |url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/nirmala-sitharaman-hits-back-says-upa-ousted-hal-from-rafale-deal/articleshow/65864076.cms |accessdate=22 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==French Government response==
Former French President [[Francois Hollande]] has been quoted by an article on a French [[Mediapart]], an online investigative and opinion journal as stating that the Indian government had asked the French government to nominate Anil Ambani's Reliance Defence Ltd. as its India partner in the Rafale deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/indian-government-wanted-anil-ambani-as-rafale-partner-francois-hollande-1920227|title=India Government Chose Anil Ambani For Rafale, Says Francois Hollande: 10 Facts|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ex-french-president-hollande-makes-stunning-claim-on-rafale-deal-mod-says-govt-had-no-role-in-commercial-decision/articleshow/65903020.cms|title=Ex-French President Hollande reportedly makes new claim on Rafale deal, MoD says 'govt had no role in commercial decision' - Times of India|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;but later Hollande clarified that "it on the sidelines of a meeting in Canada on Friday that France “did not choose Reliance in any way.” When asked whether India had put pressure on Reliance and Dassault to work together, Mr. Hollande said he was unaware and “only Dassault can comment on this.”as reported by AFP&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/rafale-deal-no-room-for-doubt-after-hollande-clarification-says-rajnath/article25028171.ece|title=Rafale deal: No room for doubt after Hollande ‘clarification,’ says Rajnath|date=2018-09-24|work=The Hindu|access-date=2018-11-09|others=PTI|language=en-IN|issn=0971-751X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contradicting Hollande's claim, French government issued a statement mentioning that  French companies have the full freedom to select Indian firms for the Rafale contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=ibn |title=ibn |url=https://www.news18.com/news/india/after-hollandes-bombshell-french-govt-says-not-involved-in-choice-of-indian-partners-for-rafale-deal-1885361.html?ref=hp_top_pos_2 |accessdate=22 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dassault also clarified that Anil Ambani was Dassault Aviation’s choice&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=indiatimes |title=rafael |url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/defence/rafale-controversy-france-dassault-aviation-denies-involvement-in-choosing-indian-partners/articleshow/65908715.cms |accessdate=22 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Indian Government response ==
Finance minister [[Arun Jaitley]] later dissmised the charges as factually false.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/arun-jaitley-says-congress-allegations-on-rafale-deal-pricing-factually-false-1907942|title=Arun Jaitley's Counter On Rafale Row Talks Of Rahul Gandhi "Misadventure"|work=NDTV.com|access-date=2018-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Indian government's Defence Ministry reiterated its earlier stand while responding to later claims of former French President Francois Hollande about involvement of a particular private firm's Rafale offset contract by saying "Neither government of India nor French government had any say in the commercial decision".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=NDTV |title=RAFELE |url=https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/no-say-in-rafale-decision-centre-on-frances-claim-of-favouring-reliance-1920256 |accessdate=21 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Allegations against Anil Ambani and Reliance Defence Ltd==
Indian National Congress accused Indian business magnate [[Anil Ambani]]'s [[Reliance Naval and Engineering Limited|Reliance Defence Ltd]] of getting the part of the contract by unfair means.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://indianexpress.com/article/india/reliance-defence-set-up-days-before-rafale-deal-announced-congress/|title=Reliance Defence set up days before Rafale deal announced: Congress|date=2018-07-28|work=The Indian Express|access-date=2018-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The offsets contracts in the deal is alleged as the biggest example of [[crony capitalism]]

In response, Anil Ambani threatened to sue Congress Party for defamation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/rafale-deal-fair-says-france-reliance-defence-warns-congress-1775923|title=Rafale Deal Fair, Says France; Reliance Says May Sue Congress: 10 Points|work=NDTV.com|access-date=2018-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A  'Recordable offence' should not be confused with a '[[Notifiable Offence|Notifiable Offenc]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;e'.

==Legislation==

The power for police to keep such records is contained in the National Police Records (Recordable Offences) Regulations 2000. This states that a 'crime recordable offence' is an offence which must be recorded as a conviction on the PNC.

Recordable offences include any offence punishable by imprisonment, plus a number of non-imprisonable offences, such as:

* nuisance communications (phone calls, letters)
* tampering with motor vehicles
* firearms, air weapons, knives
* football offences
* causing harm or danger to children
* drunkenness
* poaching
* squatting{{fact|date=December 2014}}
* failing to provide a specimen of breath, and
* taking a pedal cycle without owner's consent

A '''regent''' (from the [[Latin]] ''regens'':&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|regency|accessdate=2014-08-18}} "early 15c., "government by regents," from Medieval Latin regentia, from Latin regens (see regent). Notable instances were: France 1715-1723 (under Philip, Duke of Orleans), Britain 1811-1820 (under George, Prince of Wales, Prince Regent)..."&lt;/ref&gt; ruling, governing&lt;ref name="TCUDASL"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The cyclopaedia; or, Universal dictionary of arts, sciences, and literature|url=https://archive.org/details/cyclopaediaorun29rees|first=Abraham|last=Rees|authorlink=|publisher=Longman, Hurst, Rees, Orme &amp; Brown|location=London|date=1819|page=|at=REGENT|language=|volume=29|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ADOEL"&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Dictionary of the English Language ... Abstracted from the folio edition of the author ... Fourteenth edition, corrected, etc|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=O7P8wS-pau4C|first=Samuel|last=Johnson|authorlink=|publisher=A &amp; H Spottiswoode|location=London|date=1828|page=|at=REGENT|language=|volume=|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a person appointed to govern a state because the monarch is a minor, is absent or is incapacitated.&lt;ref name="TCUDASL" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''&lt;/ref&gt; The rule of a regent or regents is called a '''regency'''. A regent or regency council may be formed ''ad hoc'' or in accordance with a constitutional rule. "Regent" is sometimes a formal title. If the regent is holding his position due to his position in the [[order of succession|line of succession]], the compound term [[prince regent]] is often used; if the regent of a minor is his mother, she is often referred to as "queen regent".

If the formally appointed regent is unavailable or cannot serve on a temporary basis, a ''Regent ad interim'' may be appointed to fill the gap.

In a monarchy, a regent usually governs due to one of these reasons, but may also be elected to rule during the [[interregnum]] when the royal line has died out. This was the case in the [[Kingdom of Finland]] and the [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920–1946)|Kingdom of Hungary]], where the royal line was considered extinct in the [[aftermath of World War I]]. In [[Iceland]], the regent represented the [[King of Denmark]] as sovereign of Iceland until the country became a republic in 1944. In the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] (1569–1795), kings were [[Royal elections in Poland|elective]], which often led to a fairly long interregnum. In the interim, it was the [[primate (bishop)|Roman Catholic Primate]] (the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Gniezno|Archbishop of Gniezno]]) who served as the regent, termed the "[[Interrex (Poland)|interrex]]" ([[Latin]]: ruler "between kings" as in ancient Rome). In the small republic of [[San Marino]], the two [[Captains Regent]], or ''Capitani Reggenti'', are elected semi-annually (they serve a six-month term) as joint heads of state and of government.

Famous regency periods include that of the Prince Regent, later [[George IV of the United Kingdom]], giving rise to many terms such as [[Regency era]] and [[Regency architecture]]. Strictly this period lasted from 1811 to 1820, when his father [[George III]] was insane, though when used as a period label it generally covers a wider period. [[Philippe II, Duke of Orléans]] was Regent of France from the death of Louis XIV in 1715 until Louis XV came of age in 1723; this is also used as a period label for many aspects of French history, as "[[Régence]]" in French, again tending to cover a rather wider period than the actual regency.  The equivalent Greek term is '''epitropos''', meaning overseer. 

As of 2018, [[Liechtenstein]] (under [[Alois, Hereditary Prince of Liechtenstein]]) is the only country with an active regency.

==Other uses==
[[File:Frans Hals - De regentessen van het oudemannenhuis.jpg|{{largethumb}}|''[[Regentesses of the Old Men's Almshouse]]'' in [[Haarlem]], [[Frans Hals]], 1664]]
The term regent may refer to positions lower than the ruler of a country. The term may be used in the governance of organisations, typically as an equivalent of "director", and held by all members of a governing board rather than just the equivalent of the chief executive. Some [[university]] managers in [[North America]] are called regents and a management board for a [[college]] or [[university]] may be titled the "[[Board of Regents]]". In [[New York (state)|New York State]], all activities related to public and private education ([[P-12 (education)|P-12]] and [[Higher education|postsecondary]]) and professional licensure are administered by the [[Board of Regents of the University of the State of New York]], the appointed members of which are called regents. The term "regent" is also used for members of governing bodies of institutions such as the national banks of [[France]] and [[Belgium]]. 

In the [[Dutch Republic]], the members of the ruling class, not formally hereditary but forming a [[de facto]] [[patrician (post-Roman Europe)|patrician]] class, were informally known collectively as ''[[regenten]]'' (the [[Dutch language|Dutch]] plural for ''regent'') because they typically held positions as "regent" on the boards of town councils, as well as charitable and civic institutions. The [[regents group portrait]], ''regentenstuk'' or ''regentessenstuk'' for female boards in [[Dutch language|Dutch]], literally "regents' piece", is a [[group portrait]] of the board of trustees, called regents or regentesses, of a [[charitable organization]] or [[guild]]. This type of group portrait was popular in [[Dutch Golden Age painting]] during the 17th and 18th centuries. In the [[Dutch East Indies]], a regent was a native prince allowed to rule de facto colonized 'state' as a ''[[regentschap]]'' (see that term). Consequently, in the successor state of [[Indonesia]], the term regent is used in [[English language|English]] to mean a ''bupati'', the head of a ''kabupaten'' (second level local government).

Again in Belgium and France{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}, (''Régent'' in French, or in Dutch) Regent is the official title of a teacher in a lower secondary school ([[junior high school]]), who does not require a [[college degree]] but is trained in a specialized ''école normale'' ([[normal school]]). In the [[Philippines]], specifically, the [[University of Santo Tomas]], the Father Regent, who must be a [[Dominican Order|Dominican priest]] and is often also a teacher, serves as the institution's spiritual head. They also form the Council of Regents that serves as the highest administrative council of the university. In the Society of Jesus, a regent is an individual training to be a Jesuit and who has completed his Novitiate and Philosophy studies, but has not yet progressed to Theology studies. A regent in the Jesuits is often assigned to teach in a school or some other academic institution as part of the formation toward final vows.

[[Image:Verboten Zeitung 1933.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''[[Das Andere Deutschland]]'''s final issue, announcing its own prohibition (''Verbot'') by the police authorities on the basis of the Reichstag fire decree]]

The '''Reichstag Fire Decree''' ({{lang-de|Reichstagsbrandverordnung}}) is the common name of the '''Decree of the Reich President for the Protection of People and State''' ({{lang-de|Verordnung des Reichspräsidenten zum Schutz von Volk und Staat}}) issued by [[Germany|German]] [[President of Germany (1919–1945)|President]] [[Paul von Hindenburg]] on the advice of [[Chancellor of Germany|Chancellor]] [[Adolf Hitler]] on 28 February 1933 in immediate response to the [[Reichstag fire]]. The decree nullified many of the key [[civil liberties]] of German citizens. With [[Nazism|Nazis]] in powerful positions in the [[Government of Nazi Germany|German government]], the decree was used as the legal basis for the imprisonment of anyone considered to be opponents of the Nazis, and to suppress publications not considered "friendly" to the Nazi cause. The decree is considered by historians as one of the key steps in the establishment of a [[One-party state|one-party]] [[Nazi Germany|Nazi state]] in Germany.

== Background ==
Hitler had been appointed [[Chancellor of Germany (German Reich)|Chancellor of Germany]] only four weeks previously, on 30 January 1933, when he was invited by President von Hindenburg to lead a coalition government. Hitler’s government had urged von Hindenburg to dissolve the [[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]] and to call elections for 5 March.

On the evening of 27 February 1933 &amp;mdash; six days before the parliamentary election &amp;mdash; [[Reichstag fire|fire broke out in the Reichstag]] chambers. While the exact circumstances of the fire remain unclear to this day, what is clear is that Hitler and his supporters quickly capitalized on the fire as a means by which to speed their consolidation of power. Hitler almost immediately blamed the [[Communist Party of Germany]] (KPD) for causing the blaze, and believed the fire would result in more Germans supporting the Nazis. According to [[Rudolf Diels]], Hitler was heard shouting through the fire "these sub-humans do not understand how the people stand at our side. In their mouse-holes, out of which they now want to come, of course they hear nothing of the cheering of the masses."&lt;ref name="Gellately2001"&gt;{{cite book|author= Robert Gellately | title = Backing Hitler: Consent and Coercion in Nazi Germany | date = 8 March 2001 | publisher = Oxford University Press | isbn = 978-0-19-160452-2 | page = 18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seizing on the burning of the [[Reichstag (building)|Reichstag building]] as the supposed opening salvo in a communist uprising, the Nazis were able to throw millions of Germans into a convulsion of fear at the threat of Communist terror. The official account stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The burning of the Reichstag was intended to be the signal for a bloody uprising and [[civil war]].  Large-scale pillaging in Berlin was planned for as early as four o&amp;rsquo;clock in the morning on Tuesday.  It has been determined that starting today throughout Germany acts of [[terrorism]] were to begin against prominent individuals, against [[private property]], against the lives and safety of the peaceful population, and general civil war was to be unleashed&amp;hellip;&lt;ref name="fest_book"&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/blockquote&gt;


Within hours of the fire, dozens of Communists had been thrown into jail. The next day, officials in the [[Prussian Ministry of the Interior]], which was led by [[Hermann Göring]], discussed ways to provide legal cover for the arrests.  Ludwig Grauert, the chief of the Prussian state police, proposed an emergency presidential decree under [[Article 48]] of the [[Weimar Constitution]], which gave the president the power to take any measure necessary to protect [[public safety]] without the consent of the Reichstag.  It would have suspended most civil liberties under the pretence of preventing further Communist violence.  There had already been discussions within the Cabinet about enacting such measures.  Justice Minister [[Franz Gürtner]], a member of the Nazis' coalition partner, the [[German National People's Party]] (DNVP), had actually brought a draft decree before the cabinet on the afternoon of 27 February.&lt;ref name=Evans/&gt;

When the proposed decree was brought before the Reich Cabinet, Interior Minister [[Wilhelm Frick]], the only Nazi in the cabinet who had a portfolio, added a clause that would allow the cabinet to take over the state governments if they failed to maintain order.  Notably, the cabinet would have been allowed to do this on its own authority.  Frick was well aware that the Interior portfolio had been given to the Nazis because it was almost powerless; unlike his counterparts in the rest of Europe, he had no power over the police.  He saw a chance to extend his power over the states and thus begin the process of Nazifying the country.

At an emergency cabinet meeting, Hitler declared that the fire now made it a matter of "ruthless confrontation of the KPD"--a confrontation that could not be "made dependent on judicial considerations."  Though [[Vice Chancellor of Germany|Vice Chancellor]] [[Franz von Papen]] objected to the clause giving the Reich cabinet the power to take over the state governments if necessary, the decree was approved. Shortly thereafter, President von Hindenburg signed the decree into law.&lt;ref name=Evans/&gt;   

The decree consisted of six articles. Article 1 indefinitely suspended most of the civil liberties set forth in the Weimar Constitution, including [[habeas corpus]], [[freedom of expression]], [[freedom of the press]], the [[freedom of association|right of free association]] and [[freedom of assembly|public assembly]], the [[Secrecy of correspondence|secrecy of the post and telephone]], not to mention the protection of property and the home. Articles 2 and 3 allowed the Reich government to assume powers normally reserved for the [[States of Germany|federal states]]. Articles 4 and 5 established [[wikt:draconian|draconian]] penalties for certain offenses, including the [[death penalty]] for [[arson]] to public buildings. Article 6 simply stated that the decree took effect on the day of its proclamation.

==Text of the decree==
The preamble and Article 1 of the Reichstag Fire Decree show the methods by which the civil rights protections of the Weimar Republic’s democratic constitution were legally abolished by the Nazis:

== Effects ==
The decree was not accompanied by any written guidelines from the Reich government; this omission gave wide latitude in interpreting the decree to Nazis like Göring, who as [[Prussia]]n interior minister was the commander of the largest police force in Germany. The ''[[States of Germany|Länder]]'' not yet in the Nazis’ grasp largely restricted themselves to banning the Communist press, Communist meetings and demonstrations, and detaining leading KPD officials. In Prussia, however, summary arrests of KPD leaders were common, thousands were imprisoned in the days following the fire, and the total number of arrests in Prussia on the basis of the Reichstag Fire Decree in the two weeks following 28 February is believed to be in the vicinity of 10,000. Göring had actually employed such tactics even ''before'' the decree, only to have them thrown out by the courts &amp;mdash; a check that no longer had any effect with the decree in place.

Among the German communists arrested on the basis of the Reichstag Fire Decree was KPD chairman [[Ernst Thälmann]]; while KPD founding members [[Wilhelm Pieck]] and [[Walter Ulbricht]] &amp;mdash; later to be leaders in postwar [[East Germany]] &amp;mdash; were among those who escaped arrest and lived in exile.

Göring issued a directive to the Prussian police authorities on 3 March, stating that in addition to the constitutional rights stripped by the decree, “all other restraints on police action imposed by Reich and State law” were abolished “so far as this is necessary … to achieve the purpose of the decree.” Göring went on to say that

&lt;blockquote&gt;
In keeping with the purpose and aim of the decree the additional measures &amp;hellip; will be directed against the Communists in the first instance, but then also against those who co-operate with the Communists and who support or encourage their criminal aims&amp;hellip; I would point out that any necessary measures against members or establishments of other than Communist, [[anarchist]] or [[Social Democratic]] parties can only be justified by the decree &amp;hellip; if they serve to help the defense against such Communist activities in the widest sense.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Within two weeks of the Reichstag Fire Decree taking effect, Reich Commissars were sent out to take over the other states; the heavy-handed repression that was occurring in Prussia quickly spread to the rest of the Reich.

Despite the virulent rhetoric directed against the Communists, the Nazis did not formally ban the KPD right away.  Not only did they fear a violent uprising, but they hoped the KPD's presence on the ballot would siphon off votes from the Social Democratic Party (SPD).  However, while the KPD managed to win 81 seats, it was an open secret that the KPD deputies would never be allowed to take their seats; they were thrown in jail as quickly as the police could track them down.  Increasingly, the courts treated KPD membership as an act of treason.  Thus, for all intents and purposes, the KPD was banned as of 6 March, the day after the election.&lt;ref name=Evans&gt;{{cite book|last=Evans|first=Richard J.|authorlink=Richard J. Evans|title=[[The Third Reich Trilogy#The Coming of the Third Reich|The Coming of the Third Reich]]|publisher=[[Penguin Group|Penguin Press]]|location=[[New York City]]|date=2003|isbn=978-0141009759}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Just over three weeks after the passage of the Reichstag Fire Decree, Hitler’s National Socialists further tightened their grasp on Germany by the passage of the [[Enabling Act of 1933|Enabling Act]]. This act gave Hitler’s cabinet the legal power to decree laws without being passed by the Reichstag &amp;mdash; effectively making Hitler a dictator.  Leaving nothing to chance, the Nazis did not even count the arrested KPD deputies for the purposes of determining a quorum.  They also used the provisions of the Reichstag Fire Decree to detain several SPD deputies, ensuring that it would pass with two-thirds of those present and voting.  As it turned out, the highly intimidating atmosphere of that Reichstag session resulted in the Enabling Act passing with enough support that it would have garnered the required supermajority even if all KPD and SPD deputies had been present.

In theory, Article 48 gave the Reichstag the power to demand the cancellation of the measures taken to enforce the Reichstag Fire Decree.  However, any realistic chance of it being cancelled ended in July; by this time the other parties had either been banned outright or intimidated into dissolving themselves, and the Nazi Party had been declared the only legal party in Germany.

The Reichstag Fire Decree remained in force for the duration of the Nazi era, allowing Hitler to rule under what amounted to martial law. Along with the Enabling Act, it formed the legal basis for Hitler’s dictatorship. Thousands of Hitler’s decrees, such as those which turned Germany into a one-party state, were explicitly based on its authority, and hence on Article 48.  This was a major reason Hitler never formally abolished the Weimar Constitution, though it no longer had any substantive value after the passage of the Enabling Act.  It was also a major factor, combined with the broader misuse of Article 48, behind the framers of the postwar [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany]] opting to significantly curb the powers of the president, to the point that he has little de facto executive power.

{{Communist Parties}}
The '''Revolutionary Communist Group''' (RCG) is a [[communist]], Marxist and Leninist political organisation in the [[United Kingdom]].

According to its own statements, the group "exists in order to defend and develop an anti-imperialist trend within Britain, based on the long term interests of the entire working class and oppressed internationally. We stand for the creation of a society organised both to meet the needs of the entire population, and to ensure the fullest possible development of every individual."&lt;ref name="What We Stand For"&gt;[[#RCG|Revolutionary Communist Group]].&lt;/ref&gt; Emphasising a campaign against [[capitalism]] and the oppression of the [[working classes]], the group is also highly critical of British foreign policy, believing it to be [[imperialism|imperialistic]] in nature. In particular, they criticise British control of [[Northern Ireland]] and the [[Falkland Islands]], the involvement of British troops in [[Iraq]] and [[Afghanistan]], and the British government’s support for [[Israel]].&lt;ref name="What We Stand For"/&gt;

Believing that the British electoral system under capitalism cannot bring about any real change in society, and as it does not consider itself a party (believing that a communist party, led by a vanguard of the proletariat, has not yet developed in Britain), the RCG has not taken part in elections since 1979. The group also publish their own newspaper, which now appears every two months, entitled '''''Fight Racism! Fight Imperialism!''''', which has been running since November–December 1979.

== Political ideology ==

===Marxist position===
{{Quote box
| quote = "The RCG believes that the way for human society to progress – or even to survive – is for [[capitalism]] to be destroyed. The British ruling class will never allow the system which maintains its domination to be wished or voted away – it will take a [[revolution]] led by the working class. The only alternative to capitalism is [[Socialism (Marxism)|socialism]]: a conscious and organised process of constructing society in which people cooperate in order to meet their needs rather than serve the dictates of private profits; a society enabling the full development of every individual rather than privilege for a few."
|source=Statement by the RCG.&lt;ref name="What We Stand For"/&gt;
| align = right

| bgcolor = #C0C0C0
}}
The Revolutionary Communist Group is a [[communism|communist]] organisation. It believes that the United Kingdom is a [[Bourgeoisie|dictatorship of the bourgeoisie]] (i.e., a state where the ruling upper classes control the economic and political powers to the detriment of the working classes, in this case through a [[representative democracy]]), and believe that the only real way to enact social change is for the working classes to take power in a [[revolution]], thereby establishing a [[dictatorship of the proletariat]] (i.e., a state ruled through [[participatory democracy]] by the working classes for the benefit of the masses).&lt;ref name="What We Stand For"/&gt;

Writing in 2007, the British Trotskyist group Permanent Revolution characterised the RCG's position as being "distinctive on the British left by their open espousal of left [[Stalinism]], which essentially consists of an uncritical support for the leadership of anti-imperialist struggles, an uncritical support for the Cuban regime, a completely undemocratic internal structure, an active participation in anti-racist struggles and complete rejection of any united front work within the British labour movement, trade unions or Labour Party."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Per07|Permanent Revolution 2007]].&lt;/ref&gt; Group members see this as a caricature of the RCG, and instead claim that the RCG is a democratic-centralist organisation in the Leninist tradition.

=== Criticism of British imperialism ===
The RCG believes that the United Kingdom has been an imperialist power since the end of the nineteenth century, stating that "Britain is the oldest imperialist country in the world. It was the first to develop into finance monopoly capitalism – imperialism, and is still a major imperialist power, second only to the United States. Britain's imperialist character has been decisive in determining British economic, social and political developments." In this way they believe that the British state has interfered in foreign affairs, historically through the [[British Empire]] and continuing through foreign wars and corporate dominance, to the detriment to the working class masses living in these countries.&lt;ref name="What We Stand For"/&gt;

The group supports revolutionary national democratic governments in various [[Third World|Third]] and [[Second World]] countries such as the [[Bolivarianism|Bolivarian]] government of [[Hugo Chávez]] in Venezuela, and the government of [[Evo Morales]] in Bolivia. It supports socialist Cuba and the socialist government of Cuba. The RCG believes that such movements in alliance with Cuba have the ability to radically help the working class masses living in these nations, and fight against the imperialism of the United Kingdom, United States and other [[First World]] states who use them for cheap labour. As they make clear on their website, "The resistance movements in the oppressed nations are weakening imperialism; an anti-imperialist movement in this country in unity with these struggles can deal a decisive blow against British imperialism and the British ruling class. For this reason the RCG has always given complete and unconditional support to liberation movements fighting imperialism and we support their right to carry out their struggles by any means necessary."&lt;ref name="What We Stand For"/&gt;

The RCG argues that socialists should not give their support to the centre/centre-left [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], which is one of the major political parties in the United Kingdom. On this subject, David Yaffe stated the RCG's position that "no anti-imperialist or socialist movement can be built unless the British left makes a fundamental and irrevocable break with the British Labour Party." He went on to characterise the party's policies in government as being "openly racist, imperialist and warmongering".&lt;ref name="Yaffe 2004-2005"&gt;[[#Yaf04-05|Yaffe 2004-2005]].&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time it has remained critical of other socialist organisations in Britain such as the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]], [[Militant (Trotskyist group)|Militant]], the [[International Marxist Group]] and the [[Socialist Workers Party (UK)|Socialist Workers Party]] for what it sees as being "major obstacle[s]" to the building of an anti-imperialist movement in Britain. This is because many of these groups denounced the governments of socialist states such as the Soviet Union, China and Cuba, and instead encouraged their members to vote for the Labour Party.&lt;ref name="Yaffe 2004-2005"/&gt;

=== Criticism of racism, immigration controls and discrimination ===

The RCG has been firmly critical of [[racism]] and particularly the racism of the British government and state. It has supported groups of [[black nationalism|black nationalists]] in the United States in their attempt to defend themselves from racist attacks. It also opposes any constraints on [[immigration]], believing that any constraints on immigration are inherently racist in an imperialist country. It also criticises all other forms of discrimination in society, stating that "We oppose all discrimination against anyone on grounds of gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation and disability."&lt;ref name="What We Stand For"/&gt;

==History==

===Early years: 1970-1976===
Developing in the early 1970s, the RCG grew out of the "Revolutionary Opposition" faction of the [[International Socialists (UK)|International Socialists]] (IS), (forerunners of the [[Socialist Workers Party (UK)|Socialist Workers Party]]), being strongly influenced by the politics of Roy Tearse. When the leading figures of the "Revolutionary Opposition", the name itself only first appearing in print in their appeal document, were expelled from the IS its members met to decide on their course of action, and disagreements between Tearse's allies and the majority of the faction around David Yaffe rapidly surfaced. The result was that Tearse's supporters formed the Discussion Group which led a quiet life for a number of years inside the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] before dissolving. Meanwhile, Yaffe and his comrades proceeded to found the Revolutionary Communist Group in 1974.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Revolutionary Communist No 1 October 1974 p14&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1975, the RCG began publishing a theoretical journal called ''Revolutionary Communist'' in which it in part espoused a view of [[crisis theory]], a theme they had already addressed in the IS when challenging the work of the theoreticians of that group.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.revolutionarycommunist.org/marxism.html ''Revolutionary Communist'']&lt;/ref&gt; They developed [[Karl Marx]], [[Friedrich Engels]] and [[Vladimir Lenin]]'s analysis of the [[labour aristocracy]], and showed its relevance for politics in the period after the Second World War.  Their conclusions led them to call for no vote for the Labour Party.

The early years of the RCG saw the group lose a large part of its initial membership. For example, in September 1975 the Birmingham branch decamped in order to join the [[Workers' Socialist League]].{{citation needed|date=May 2011}}

[[File:Frank Furedi by David Shankbone.jpg|right|thumb|Hungarian sociologist [[Frank Furedi]] was an early member of the RCG before being ejected in 1976, following which he founding the Revolutionary Communist Tendency. In later life he rejected socialism and became a [[libertarianism|libertarian]].]]
A few years after the RCG's foundation, disagreements emerged amongst its members regarding such topics as [[Stalinism]] and the South African government. One group, dominated by [[Frank Furedi]] (1947-), a sociologist at the [[University of Kent]] who used the pseudonym of "Frank Richards", began to argue against the views put forward by David Yaffe and his supporters. Yaffe himself later remarked that Furedi had been "organising among a clique of middle-class members, and became their self-styled guru".&lt;ref name="Beckett"&gt;[[#Bec99|Beckett 1999]].&lt;/ref&gt; In November 1976, Furedi and his followers were expelled from the RCG, following which they went on to form their own rival organisation, the [[Revolutionary Communist Tendency]] (RCT). Soon, the RCT itself splintered, with a group calling itself the Committee for a Communist Programme (CPP) being founded by several dissenting members.&lt;ref name="Leversha 26"&gt;[[#Lev78|Leversha 1978]]. p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; Following this, the RCT went on to change its name to the [[Revolutionary Communist Party (Furedi)|Revolutionary Communist Party]] in 1981, and would publish the magazine ''[[Living Marxism]]'' from 1988 to 2000, in which their political position moved from [[Leninism]] to [[Libertarian Marxism]].&lt;ref name="Beckett"/&gt;

The RCG recognised the progressive role played by some of the traditional communist parties such as the [[South African Communist Party]] and from that position developed into a more orthodox communist grouping supporting the [[socialist]] revolution in [[Cuba]].{{citation needed|date=May 2011}}

Whilst many self-proclaimed [[socialist]] organisations, especially those regarding themselves as Trotskyist, in the UK welcomed the demise of the [[Eastern Bloc]] and then of the [[Soviet Union]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Reed|first=David|title=Uphold the banner of communism|newspaper=Fight Racism! Fight Imperialism!|date=October–November 1991|author2=Eddie Abrahams}}&lt;/ref&gt;  the RCG argued that these events were [[counterrevolutionary]] and constituted a setback in the [[class struggle]] internationally because many [[national liberation]] movements and socialist states in the [[Third World]] were supported by the Soviet Union and the [[Comecon]]. The RCG believed that while the Soviet Union was a [[socialist state]], as a result of both internal developments in the Soviet Union itself and the reactionary role of working class parties (social democratic and communist) in the imperialist countries, the revolution degenerated and the communist party became an elite party separate from the working class. These developments laid the foundation for the counterrevolution between 1989-91.{{citation needed|date=May 2011}}

===Solidarity with Ireland and South Africa: 1977-1989===

During the late 1970s and early 1980s, the RCG became heavily involved in support for the [[Ireland|Irish]] national liberation struggle, working with the Prisoners Aid Committee, [[Sinn Féin]] and the [[Troops Out Movement]] (TOM), and focussing particularly on support for [[Irish republican]] prisoners held in British prisons. The analysis which the RCG developed through this work, on the role of national liberation movements in opposing [[imperialism]], laid the foundations for much of its later positions, and its relationship to the rest of the British [[Left-wing politics|left]]. Unlike many other left organisations, the RCG consistently argued that British troops had no progressive role to play in Ireland, and called for total support for the Republican movement in the struggle against British imperialism. Their involvement with the prisoner support groups established a tradition of outspoken support for prison struggles which has continued to the present, with a page of every issue of their newspaper dealing with prison conditions and struggles. In 1990, when prisoners at [[Strangeways]] (see [[1990 Strangeways Prison riot]]) took over the prison in protest at conditions, the RCG was active together with other groups supporting them on the outside, and later published a book, 'Strangeways: A Serious Disturbance', largely written by prisoners and former prisoners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jameson|first=Nicki|title=Strangeways 1990: a serious disturbance|year=1995|publisher=Larkin Publications|location=London|isbn=0 905400 18 6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1980s, the RCG's most notable activity was its participation in the non-stop picket of the [[South Africa]]n embassy in [[London]] calling for the release of [[Nelson Mandela]].  This was organized by the [[City of London Anti-Apartheid Group]], within which the RCG played a leading role alongside elements of the [[Workers' Revolutionary Party (UK)|Workers' Revolutionary Party]], the [[Humanist Party (UK)|Humanist Party]] and members of the Kitson family. City AA, as it became known, had been founded by [[Norma Kitson]], the wife of the South African Communist activist David Kitson who served 19 years and 5 months in prison in a South African prison for his work in the National High Command of [[Umkhonto we Sizwe]] (MK), the military wing of the [[African National Congress]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Brown|first=Gavin|title=The ANC, the Kitsons and the City of London Anti-Apartheid Group|url=http://nonstopagainstapartheid.wordpress.com/2012/01/08/the-anc-the-kitsons-and-the-city-of-london-anti-apartheid-group-anc100years/|work=Non-Stop Against Apartheid|accessdate=17 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

City AA was eventually expelled by the national leadership of the [[Anti-Apartheid Movement]], over differences centering on City Group's insistence on making the link between British support for apartheid in South Africa, and racism within Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brickley|first=Carol|title=South Africa - Britain out of Apartheid; Apartheid out of Britain|year=1985|publisher=Larkin Publications|location=London|isbn=0-905400-07-0|url=http://revolutionarycommunist.org/images/pdf/rcg_south_africa_pamphlet_lq.pdf|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another significant campaign during the 1980s was the [[Viraj Mendis]] Defence Campaign, against the deportation of one of the group's members to [[Sri Lanka]]. This developed into a high-profile national campaign involving people from left-wing groups such as the RCG, local residents of [[Manchester]], and extending to church leaders and Labour Party [[Member of Parliament|Members of Parliament]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Viraj Mendis Defence Campaign|title=Viraj Mendis Will Stay!|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mxTPnEdEsg|accessdate=17 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Solidarity with Cuba and Palestine: 1990-present ===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:RCG Cuba badge.JPG|150px|thumb|Badge produced by the RCG to express solidarity with the socialist governments of Cuba and Venezuela.]] --&gt;

In 1995 the RCG set up [[Rock Around the Blockade]] (RATB), a solidarity organisation with the Cuban Revolution. As well as campaigning on issues such as the [[United States|US]] economic [[blockade]] and the [[Cuban Five]], and sending political solidarity brigades to Cuba, RATB raised funds to take sound systems out to Cuba. These were used with young people in cultural and political work, and the RATB has donated five sound systems over a ten-year period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rock Around the Blockade|title=The streets are ours: Revolutionary Cuba|year=2001|publisher=Larkin Publications|location=London|isbn=0-905400-19-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001 three members were asked to leave or resign because of what were described as their reactionary [[ultra-left]] views. One example of the division was over the [[September 11, 2001 attacks|September 11th attacks in 2001]], which the three people who left viewed as a victory against imperialism. They had previously alleged that the leadership was bureaucratic and failing to train the membership in [[Marxism-Leninism]]. The three left to form Communist Forum, often known by the name of their newsletter, ''Fightback''. They have ceased to be active.{{citation needed|date=May 2011}}

Following the start of the [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] [[Al-Aqsa Intifada|second intifada]] in September 2000, in October the RCG joined a group which had begun to picket [[Marks and Spencer]] in Manchester over their support for [[Israel]], and helped to spread this to other cities. Over the next six years pickets of Marks and Spencer were held in places including [[Glasgow]], [[Edinburgh]], [[Dundee]], [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]], [[Stockton-on-Tees|Stockton]], [[Middlesbrough]], [[Durham, England|Durham]], [[Rochdale]], [[Nottingham]], [[Leicester]], across London, Stratford and [[Brighton]]. Throughout this period the flagship store on [[Oxford Street]] in London was picketed weekly, and in many other places pickets were sustained on a regular basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Donovan|first=Fiona|title=10 years of boycotting M&amp;S|url=http://revolutionarycommunist.org/index.php/palestine/1926-10-years-of-boycotting-mas-frfi-217-octnov-2010|accessdate=17 April 2014|newspaper=Fight Racism!

In 2005 and 2006, the RCG stepped up their work in solidarity with [[asylum seekers]], supporting the setting up of [[UNITY (asylum seekers organisation)|UNITY]], an asylum seekers' union, in Glasgow,{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} and helping to establish Tyneside Community Action for Refugees (TCAR) in Newcastle and [[Gateshead]] and the North West Asylum Seekers Defence Group (NWASDG) in Manchester (for a selection of reports from this period see [http://www.revolutionarycommunist.org/index.php/fight-racism/1498-defend-asylum-seekers--frfi-189-feb--mar-2006.html 1], [http://www.revolutionarycommunist.org/index.php/round-up/458-frfi-round-up-events--frfi-192-aug--sep-2006.html 2]).

===Opposition to government spending cuts===
In October 2010 the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government announced cuts in state spending of £81bn, £11bn greater than the £70bn cuts which the preceding Labour government had said in autumn 2009 were necessary. There would be cuts in state benefits, central government departments and a 26% reduction in central government funding for local government. In its newspaper, the RCG said the ruling class "has declared class war.".&lt;ref&gt;FRFI 218, December 2010/January 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The RCG adopted a slogan "No cuts – full stop!" It condemned Labour-run councils implementing the cuts. It described Labour councillors voting for such cuts as "class enemies", opposing any alliance with them against the coalition government. It criticised those on the left who sought unity at any price with such politicians.&lt;ref&gt;FRFI 219, February/March 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

As a part of the government cuts, the coalition announced plans to simultaneously cut much university funding and dramatically increase the tuition fees charged to students. This move led to [[2010 UK student protests|widespread student protests taking place in November and December 2010]], during which demonstrators occupied the central [[Jeremy Bentham|Jeremy Bentham Room]] in [[University College London]] (UCL) for several weeks. The protesting UCL students (some of whom were RCG members or supporters) organised a panel discussion to be held during which representatives from several leftist organisations (including the RCG's David Yaffe as well as figures from the [[Green Party of England and Wales]], [[Socialist Appeal (UK, 1992)|Socialist Appeal]] and [[Workers Power (UK)|Workers Power]]) discussed the reforms then being made by the government and university authorities to higher education in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;[[#RCG10|Revolutionary Communist Group 2010]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Allegation of sexual harassment (2017)===

In October 2017 the RCG posted on their website "The Revolutionary Communist Group is aware of a historic allegation of sexual harassment by a member of the organisation. The RCG views such allegations with utmost seriousness. The comrade involved has been suspended from membership and will remain suspended until an internal enquiry completes an investigation into the matter and reports with recommendations on further action".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.revolutionarycommunist.org/9-uncategorised/5056-our-311217&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of that year in December, the RCG updated on their website "Following an investigation and a period of suspension, the comrade has been reinstated as of 1 January 2018. The comrade understands that his actions were unacceptable for a communist and a member of the RCG. Through the process we have undertaken, his consciousness and behaviour has changed, and continues to change to the extent that we have decided he can now be readmitted as a full member. The RCG takes seriously the sexism, discrimination and exploitation women face and is committed to building an organisation that opposes all such oppression."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Revolutionary Communist Group|title=Update on RCG statement regarding sexual harassment (31st December)|url=http://www.revolutionarycommunist.org/9-uncategorised/5056-our-311217|accessdate=4 January 2018|website=revolutionarycommunist.org|date=31 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fight Racism! Fight Imperialism! newspaper ==
[[File:Fight Racism Fight Imperialism.jpg|thumb|right|The April/May 2011 issue of ''FRFI'', with a headline commenting critically on the [[2011 military intervention in Libya]].]]
The newspaper of the Revolutionary Communist Group, ''Fight Racism! Fight Imperialism!'' (FRFI) commemorated 25 years of publication with issue Number 182 December 2004/January 2005. The paper is still published every two months.

Commenting on the reason for titling the paper as such, David Yaffe noted that it was chosen because it was in "itself a political statement. It declares that fighting racism and imperialism must be at the heart of any socialist movement in imperialist Britain."&lt;ref name="Yaffe 2004-2005"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8390">'''Security of the person''' is a basic entitlement guaranteed by the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], adopted by the [[United Nations]] in 1948.  It is also a [[human right]] explicitly mentioned and protected by the  [[European Convention on Human Rights]], the [[Constitution of Canada]], the [[Constitution of South Africa]] and other laws around the world.

In general, the right to the security of one's person is associated with [[liberty]] and includes the right, if one is imprisoned unlawfully, to a remedy such as ''[[habeas corpus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Rhona K.M. Smith, ''Textbook on International Human Rights'', second edition, Oxford University Press, 2005, p. 240.&lt;/ref&gt;  Security of person can also be seen as an expansion of rights based on prohibitions of [[torture]] and [[cruel and unusual punishment]].  Rights to security of person can guard against less lethal conduct, and can be used in regard to prisoners' rights.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, p. 245.&lt;/ref&gt;

==United Nations==
The right to security of the person is guaranteed by Article 3 of the ''[[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]]''. In this article, it is combined with the [[right to life]] and liberty. In full, the article reads, "Everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of person."

The United Nations treaty, the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] (1966), also recognizes a right to security of person.  Article 9 states that "Everyone has the right to liberty and security of person," and the section prohibits "arbitrary arrest or detention."  The section continues, "No one shall be deprived of his liberty except on such grounds and in accordance with such procedure as are established by law."

== Europe ==
The right to security of the person is mentioned in Article 5(1) of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] under the heading ''Right to liberty and security'' ("Everyone has the right to liberty and security of person. No one shall be deprived of his liberty save in the following cases and in accordance with a procedure prescribed by law") and in Article 6 of the [[Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union]] ("Everyone  has  the  right  to  liberty  and  security  of  person"). 

==Canada==
The right to security of the person was recognized in [[Canada]] in the [[Canadian Bill of Rights]] in 1960. Section 1(a) of this law recognized "the right of the individual to life, liberty, security of the person and enjoyment of property, and the right not to be deprived thereof except by [[due process]] of law." However, the Bill of Rights was a statute and not part of the Constitution.

In 1982, a right to security of the person was added to the Constitution.  It was included in [[Section Seven of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|section 7]] of the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]], which stipulates that "Everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of the person and the right not to be deprived thereof except in accordance with the principles of [[fundamental justice]]."  Security of the person in section 7 consists of rights to privacy of the body and its health&lt;ref&gt;Hogg, Peter W.  ''Constitutional Law of Canada.''  2003 Student Ed.  Scarborough, Ontario:  Thomson Canada Limited, 2003, 981.&lt;/ref&gt; and of the right protecting the "psychological integrity" of an individual. That is, the right protects against significant government-inflicted harm ([[Stress (medicine)|stress]]) to the mental state of the individual. (''[[Blencoe v. B.C. (Human Rights Commission)]]'', 2000)

This right has generated significant case law, as [[abortion in Canada]] was legalized in ''[[R. v. Morgentaler]]'' (1988) after the Supreme Court found the [[Therapeutic Abortion Committee]]s breached women's security of person by threatening their health.  Some judges also felt control of the body was a right within security of the person, breached by the abortion law.  In ''[[Operation Dismantle v. The Queen]]'' (1985) [[cruise missile]] testing was unsuccessfully challenged as violating security of the person for risking [[Nuclear warfare|nuclear war]]. In ''[[Chaoulli v. Quebec (Attorney General)]]'' (2005), some Supreme Court justices even considered [[Quebec]]'s ban on private [[health care]] to breach security of the person, since delays in medical treatment could have physical and stressful consequences.

There has been discussion within the [[Supreme Court of Canada|Supreme Court]] and among academics as to whether security of the person also guarantees some economic rights.  Theoretically, security of the person would be breached if the government limits a person's ability to make an income, by denying [[Social welfare provision|welfare]], taking away property essential to one's profession, or denying licenses.  However, section 7 is primarily concerned with legal rights, so this reading of economic rights is questionable.  Many economic issues could also be [[political question]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Hogg, 983.&lt;/ref&gt;

==South Africa==
In 1996 the government of [[South Africa]] adopted a constitutional [[Constitution of South Africa Chapter 2: Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]] which recognized a right to security of the person in section 12.  Here, it was combined with a "right to [[Freedom (political)|freedom]]."  Section 12 went on to define security of the person and the right to freedom more thoroughly, including within it bodily control and reproductive control, freedom from torture and cruel and unusual punishment and a right to trial. In full, section 12 reads,

{{quotation|
:12.  (1) Everyone has the right to freedom and security of the person, which includes the right
::(a) not to be deprived of freedom arbitrarily or without just cause;
::(b) not to be detained without trial;
::(c) to be free from all forms of violence from either public or private sources;
::(d) not to be tortured in any way; and
::(e) not to be treated or punished in a cruel, inhuman or degrading way.

:(2) Everyone has the right to bodily and psychological integrity, which includes the right
::(a) to make decisions concerning reproduction;
::(b) to security in and control over their body; and
::(c) not to be subjected to medical or scientific experiments without their informed consent.
}}

==Turkey==
The [[Constitution of Turkey]] guarantees security of person, along with the right to liberty, in Article 19, enacted in 1982 and amended in 2001.  The article spells out limits to these rights in the form of rulings of courts under the law, allowing for mental institutions and institutions for addicts, [[extradition]], etc.  The article also limits arrest and detention to cases in which a judge allows it, where there is not enough time for this, or the person is seen being responsible for a crime.  A person will then be told why they have been arrested, and their [[next of kin]] will also be told of the arrest. Finally, the article allows for government compensation if these rights are violated.

==New Zealand==
The [[New Zealand Bill of Rights Act]], adopted in 1990, guarantees "Life and security of the person" in sections 8 through 11.  Section 8 guarantees a right to life except when deprived in accordance with fundamental justice, while section 9 prohibits cruel and unusual punishment.  Section 10 prohibits a person being subjected to medical treatment against his or her will.  Finally, section 11 gives a [[New Zealand]]er the right to not take medical treatment.

==United Kingdom==
Security of person is mentioned in Schedule I Article 5 of the [[Human Rights Act 1998]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.opsi.gov.uk/ACTS/acts1998/ukpga_19980042_en_3#sch1&lt;/ref&gt;  This version is the latest incarnation of the Act, though there have been minor edits since.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/SearchResults.aspx?TYPE=QS&amp;Title=human+rights+act&amp;Year=&amp;Number=&amp;LegType=All+Legislation&lt;/ref&gt;  This new act represents one aspect of [[Tony Blair]]'s "Constitutional Reform".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8283">'''Sinhalisation''' is a term, derived from [[Sinhala (disambiguation)|Sinhala]], that has number of meanings in [[Sri Lanka]].

==Sociological==
In a sociological context it could refer to the [[cultural assimilation|assimilation]] of ethno-cultural minorities in Sri Lanka such as the [[Sri Lankan Tamils]], [[Colombo Chetties]] and indigenous [[Vedda people|Vedda]]s into the majority Sinhalese identity,&lt;ref&gt;Susantha Goonetilleke, ''Sinhalisation: Migration or Cultural Colonization?''

Many noted elite {{cref|elite}} families of foreign origins were supposedly Sinhalised during the pre-[[colony|colonial period]].&lt;ref&gt;"History of the Colombo Chetties"  by Deshabandu Reggie Candappa  published in December, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~lkawgw/gen3146.html Pilimatalavuva - Family], roots.web, Accessed 13-06-2015&lt;/ref&gt; (see [http://sundaytimes.lk/010708/plus6.html abstract here])

==Political==
In a political context it could refer to the [[Sinhala Only Act|Sinhala language-favouring policies]] {{cref|PS}}of the post colonial governments of Sri Lanka  that is considered to be a major cause &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.paradisepoisoned.com/PDFs/Preview21.pdf

It is termed as culturo-ideological [[exclusivism]] by some{{who|date=July 2014}} when one's cultural values and norms are absolutised in such a manner that a particular way of life is enshrined as superior to all others and must therefore be adopted by others (e.g. the [[Sri Lankan Tamil|Tamil]] reaction to the perceived "Sinhalisation" processes of the Sri Lankan state)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.wcc-coe.org/wcc/what/faith/kuala-docs13-makarios.pdf |title= Ethnic Identity, National Identity and the Search for Unity|accessdate=2006-03-30 |format= |work=World Council of Churches}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was said to be a cause of the abortive coup by disgruntled Catholic army officers in [[1962 Ceylonese coup d'état attempt|1962]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.hindustantimes.in/news/7752_1708229,004100180006.htm

Currently some observers note that Sri Lankan political parties such as [[Jathika Hela Urumaya|JHU]] and [[Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna|JVP]] adhere to a policy of political Sinhalisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.uthr.org/Briefings/Briefing6.htm

==Other Meanings==
Medias use the word "Sinhalisation" to refer to the process by which the Sri Lankan government funded and sponsored settlement of Sinhala people in Tamil-dominant regions in order to make Tamil as minorities. Some reports claims that the Sinhalese and Sinhala military families are settled in houses built by money from the Indian government that was intended to improve the welfare of the Tamil people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tamilnet.com/art.html?catid=13&amp;artid=36250

==Notes==
{{refbegin}}
 &lt;!-- See [[Template:cref]] and [[Template:cnote]] for an explanation of how to create content notes for this section --&gt;
{{cnote|elite|The late President [[J. R. Jayewardene]]'s first paternal ancestor was a Colombo Chetty and there is an excerpt from the biography of J.R., authored by Prof. K.M. De Silva &amp; Howard Wriggins, in support of this. Don Adrian Jayewardene, J.R.'s paternal great-grandfather, descended from a Chetty family, but two or three generations earlier, a male of this family had married a Sinhalese by the name of Jayewardene from the village of Walgama near Hanwella and had taken on the name of Jayewardene and by the time Don Adrian arrived on the scene at the tail-end of the 18th century, ''the process of 'Sinhalisation' of his family had been completed.''[http://sundaytimes.lk/010708/plus6.html]}}

{{cnote|PS|Sri Lanka’s nation-building programme became intimately linked with a Sinhalisation of the state directive. It was expected that the [[minorities]] would be assimilated into this new [[Sinhalese people|Sinhalese]] [[Buddhist]] nation-state. Moreover, the 1956 election marked the beginning of an era of ethnically-based party politics. [http://www.brad.ac.uk/acad/confres/assets/CCR2.pdf]}}

'''The New Party''' was a [[Neoliberalism|neoliberal]] political party in the United Kingdom active between 2003 and 2010. The party described itself as "a party of [[economic liberalism]], [[Reform movement|political reform]] and [[Internationalism (politics)|internationalism]]". It supported a smaller role for the state, a significant reduction in [[bureaucracy]], renegotiation with the [[European Union]] and a strengthening of the [[Special Relationship (US-UK)|special relationship]] with the United States.

The party was founded as the '''Scottish People's Alliance''', standing at the [[Scottish Parliamentary Election, 2003|2003 Scottish Parliamentary Elections]] and receiving 7,718 votes (0.4%).&lt;ref&gt;See individual regional results from [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/bsp/hi/vote2003/scottish_parliament/html/atoz.stm#w the BBC's results page]&lt;/ref&gt; 
The New Party did not stand in the [[United Kingdom general election, 2005|2005 general election]].

== History ==

===Founding===
The New Party has its origins in the initiative ''A New Party for Britain'' launched in late 2002, at a time when speculation about the possibility of a split in the UK [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] was rife, during the leadership of [[Iain Duncan Smith]]. Before the launch, the party announced in January 2003 that it planned to scrap the [[Scottish Parliament]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/smgpubs/access/278819431.html?dids=278819431:278819431&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Jan+19%2C+2003&amp;author=Exclusive+By+Douglas+Fraser%3B+Political+Editor&amp;pub=Sunday+Herald&amp;desc=New+Party%3A+we%27ll+scrap+Holyrood&amp;pqatl=google|title=New Party: we'll scrap Holyrood|last=Fraser|first=Douglas|date=19 January 2003|work=Sunday Herald|accessdate=13 February 2010|location=Glasgow}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it was decried by [[David McLetchie]], the leader of the Scottish Conservatives, as "fascist and undemocratic."&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt; The party was officially launched on 14 March 2003, when the party was founded under the name {{sic|'''People|s Alliance'''}}, with funerals businessman Howard Hodgson as its spokesman.&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/2848523.stm|title=New party pledges 'direct democracy'|last=Stone-Lee|first=Ollie|date=14 March 2003|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=13 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The launch was timed to coincide with the Conservative Party Spring Conference the next day in Harrogate.&lt;ref name=woos/&gt; Senior figures included Jenny Ungless, Iain Duncan Smith's former chief of staff, Charlotte Kenyon, a former Conservative Party press officer, and Mark Adams, a former Conservative Party official.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/breakaway-tory-party-launched-by-funeral-tycoon-600582.html|title=Breakaway Tory party launched by funeral tycoon|last=Russell|first=Ben|date=15 March 2003|work=The Independent|accessdate=13 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The head of policy in Scotland was Bruce Skivington.&lt;ref name=thanks&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1425769/Thanks-for-the-big-party-shame-about-the-policies.html|title=Thanks for the big party – shame about the policies|last=Cochrane|first=Alan|date=27 March 2003|work=The Daily Telegraph|accessdate=13 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scottish Parliament elections===
The initial policy programme of the party had two main planks: [[direct democracy]], with all legislation subject to popular referendum; and [[universal basic income|Universal Benefit]], a direct payment from the state to every citizen as a replacement for the current [[welfare state|benefits system]].&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt;&lt;ref name=launched&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2003/mar/27/scotland.elections2003|title=New party launched in Scotland|last=Scott|first=Kirsty|date=27 March 2003|work=The Guardian|accessdate=13 February 2010 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; A reduction of the voting age to 16 was also proposed.&lt;ref name=woos&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1424578/Peoples-Alliance-party-woos-Tories-with-radical-manifesto.html|title=People's Alliance party woos Tories with radical manifesto|last=Brogan|first=Benedict|date=14 March 2003|work=The Daily Telegraph|accessdate=13 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taxes would be cut by 3p.&lt;ref name=cut&gt;{{cite news|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/smgpubs/access/304779791.html?dids=304779791:304779791&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Mar+12%2C+2003&amp;author=Michael+Settle%3B+Chief+political%3B+correspondent&amp;pub=The+Herald&amp;desc=New+party+plans+to+sell+Holyrood%2C+cut+tax+and+MSPs&amp;pqatl=google|title=New party plans to sell Holyrood, cut tax and MSPs|last=Settle|first=Martin|date=12 March 2003|work=The Herald|accessdate=13 February 2010|location=Glasgow}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pledge to scrap the Scottish parliament was dropped,&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt; but the party pledged to sell the Holyrood [[Scottish Parliament Building]], and to reduce the number of parliamentarians, in Holyrood, Westminster and an all-elected Lords.&lt;ref name=launched/&gt;&lt;ref name=cut/&gt; [[Alan Cochrane]] in the ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' commented that "the Scottish People's Alliance appears to offer a mish-mash of policies, which are for the most part half-baked – but not all that more so than many of the offerings from parties of much longer standing. And if they get their act together in time they might well appeal. Their most immediate problem appears to be that they have not got their act together in anything like enough time."&lt;ref name=thanks/&gt;

The party decided to contest the [[Scottish Parliament election, 2003|Scottish Parliamentary Election in May 2003]], fielding 16 candidates. However, the party received a small proportion of the vote and won no seats. This was despite the fact that two of the Peoples Alliance candidates, [[Lyndsay McIntosh]] and [[Keith Harding]], were outgoing Conservative [[Members of the Scottish Parliament]] (MSPs).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/2908093.stm|title=Second Tory quits party|date=1 April 2003|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=13 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; They had defected after being ranked further down the Conservative list for the election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/2910835.stm|title=Tory defectors 'betrayed' party|date=2 April 2003|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=13 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1426456/McLetchie-attacks-pair-for-betraying-Conservatives.html|title=McLetchie attacks pair for 'betraying' Conservatives|last=Peterkin|first=Tom|date=3 April 2003|work=The Daily Telegraph|accessdate=13 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The New Party===
Disappointed with its performance after spending £188,889 on the election,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/3186211.stm|title=Figures reveal election spending|date=27 August 2003|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=13 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; the party was relaunched in October 2003 with a revamped manifesto (direct democracy and Universal Benefit were dropped) and a revised statement of philosophy and principles, under the name 'The New Party'.

The party took no part in the [[European Parliament election, 2004 (United Kingdom)|2004 European Parliament Elections]]. At the end of 2004, [[United Kingdom Independence Party]] [[Member of the European Parliament|MEP]] [[Robert Kilroy-Silk]] approached the New Party with a view to becoming leader.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/smgpubs/access/785542201.html?dids=785542201:785542201&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Jan+27%2C+2005&amp;author=DOUGLAS+FRASER+SCOTTISH+POLITICAL+EDITOR&amp;pub=The+Herald&amp;desc=Party+snubs+Kilroy-Silk+approach&amp;pqatl=google|title=Party snubs Kilroy-Silk approach|last=Fraser|first=Douglas|date=27 January 2005|work=The Herald|accessdate=13 February 2010|location=Scotland}}&lt;/ref&gt; The executive declined 5 to 4, and several senior members of the New Party subsequently departed to join Kilroy-Silk's [[Veritas (political party)|Veritas]] party at its launch in February 2005, including policy director Jonathan Lockhart,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/pandora/kilroy-starts-civil-war-in-yet-another-rightwing-party-488198.html|title=Kilroy starts civil war in yet another right-wing party|last=Adams|first=Guy|date=21 January 2005|work=The Independent|accessdate=13 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Richard Vass, the first party chairman of Veritas, and [[Patrick Eston]], Kilroy-Silk's successor as leader.

The New Party did not contest the [[United Kingdom general election, 2005|2005 General Election]].

In 2007 a member and two times local election candidate for the New Party, Stewart Dimmock, with backing from [[Christopher Monckton, 3rd Viscount Monckton of Brenchley|Viscount Monckton]], the author of the party's first manifesto,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/education/article2652851.ece Please, sir – Gore's got warming wrong], Jonathan Leake, Environment Editor, ''[[The Sunday Times]]'', 14 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt; launched a partly successful [[Dimmock v Secretary of State for Education and Skills|court case]] to seek to prevent the showing of the film ''[[An Inconvenient Truth]]'' in UK schools claiming that the film is political rather than scientific in nature. The court ruled that the film could be shown in schools only if teachers pointed out nine errors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/7037671.stm BBC (11 October 2007): Gore climate film's 'nine errors'.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2008 David Pinder, the national spokesman, became the party's first UK parliamentary candidate at the [[Haltemprice and Howden by-election, 2008|Haltemprice and Howden by-election]], polling 135 votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/news-articles/mirfield-reporter-dewsbury-england/mi_7899/is_2008_July_11/local-loses-davis-election/ai_n35160002/|title=Local man loses out in Davis by-election|date=11 July 2008|work=Mirfield Reporter|accessdate=13 February 2010|location=Dewsbury}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2009 Richard Vass was named leader, declaring the party's intention to contest the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|2010 General Election]].

On 1 July 2010, the New Party was de-registered with the Electoral Commission&lt;ref&gt;Search the [https://pefonline.electoralcommission.org.uk/search/searchintro.aspx Electoral Commission PEF Online Registers].&lt;/ref&gt; and is no longer able to field candidates.

== Policy ==
The New Party describes its philosophy as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The New Party is a party of economic liberalism, political reform and internationalism. We stand for individual freedom and personal responsibility in preference to state control. We believe that only by empowering individuals and their families to take more control of their lives can we promote a spirit of mutual responsibility and respect in society as a whole.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The New Party favours small government with a [[flat-tax]] regime and measures to increase individual freedom and self-reliance, as well as [[deregulation]] of business and industry. The party recommends wholesale reform of the [[welfare state]] with measures to reduce welfare dependency, and reduction of state control of public services, including reform of the [[National Health Service]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.newparty.co.uk/news/september2007/sacred-cow.html|title= The sacred cow}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The New Party proposes various reforms of parliament, including adopting the [[Instant-runoff voting|Alternative Vote]] system for electing the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]], an appointed and non-political [[House of Lords]], and measures to strengthen the independence of the [[Civil Service (United Kingdom)|Civil Service]].

The party regards itself as internationalist in outlook, which it interprets as support for democratic governments and human rights worldwide. The party is rather more cautious with regard to international organisations such as the [[European Union]] and the United Nations. After espousing a robust [[eurosceptic]] position, the party has latterly reverted to a more equivocal stance towards the European Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newparty.co.uk/articles/openeurope.html |title=Open Europe: New Party statement on Europe |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071016140937/http://newparty.co.uk/articles/openeurope.html |archivedate=16 October 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been critical of the United Nations as an undemocratic body without [[moral authority]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.newparty.co.uk/news/april2007/united-nations-what-moral-authority.html|title= The United Nations: What moral authority?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In foreign policy the party has adopted a [[liberal interventionist]] or [[neo-conservative]] approach and has been strongly supportive of the [[War on Terror]], and British and American military intervention in [[Iraq War|Iraq]] and [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|Afghanistan]].

The most recent published policy statement of the New Party is the ''Manifesto for a World Class Nation'', published in 2005.

== Organisation ==
The party chairman, founder and chief financial backer of the New Party was Scottish millionaire businessman Robert Durward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.scotsman.com/scotlandsnewparty/The-rich-recluse-masterminding-Britains.2395433.jp|title=The rich recluse masterminding Britain's new party|last=Chamberlain|first=Gethin|date=22 January 2003|work=The Scotsman|accessdate=13 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Party is governed by a National Policy Committee for the UK as a whole, and by a Scottish Policy Committee in Scotland.

The New Party was well-funded thanks to the financial support of its chairman, and the party had a small full-time staff from the outset, with three full-time staff at the offices at Almondvale football ground in Livingston and two at Mark Adams' office in London in 2003.&lt;ref name=cash&gt;{{cite news|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/smgpubs/access/388762981.html?dids=388762981:388762981&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Aug+24%2C+2003&amp;author=Douglas+Fraser%3B+Political+Editor&amp;pub=Sunday+Herald&amp;desc=His+%28pounds%29+500%2C000+won+few+votes%2C+but+party+backer+pledges+more+cash&amp;pqatl=google|title=His £500,000 won few votes, but party backer pledges more cash|last=Fraser|first=Douglas|date=24 August 2003|work=Sunday Herald|accessdate=13 February 2010|location=Glasgow}}&lt;/ref&gt; Duward's company Cloburn Quarry funded the Peoples Alliance with £490,000 in 2003, and gave the New Party £284,000 in 2004, £393,000 in 2005,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/smgpubs/access/1086143961.html?dids=1086143961:1086143961&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Jul+29%2C+2006&amp;author=PAUL+ROGERSON&amp;pub=The+Herald&amp;desc=Quarrying+millionaire+bankrolls+New+Party+Durward+donates+further+GBP393%2C000+to+rightwing+brainchild&amp;pqatl=google|title=Quarrying millionaire bankrolls New Party Durward donates further GBP393,000 to rightwing brainchild|last=Rogerson|first=Paul|date=29 July 2006|work=The Herald|accessdate=13 February 2010|location=Glagow}}&lt;/ref&gt; £135,000 in 2006,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/cloburn-quarry-bemoans-tough-trading-conditions-1.863579|title=Cloburn Quarry bemoans tough trading conditions|last=Smith|first=Mark|date=21 August 2007|work=The Herald|accessdate=13 February 2010|location=Scotland}}&lt;/ref&gt; £209,093 in 2007,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/cloburn-profiting-from-pre-crunch-demand-1.886083|title=Cloburn profiting from pre-crunch demand|last=Williamson|first=Mark|date=2 August 2008|work=The Herald|accessdate=13 February 2010|location=Scotland}}&lt;/ref&gt; and £125,000 in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/cloburn-cuts-cash-funds-for-political-party-1.916155|title=Cloburn cuts cash funds for political party|last=Smith|first=Mark|date=6 August 2009|work=The Herald|accessdate=13 February 2010|location=Scotland}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Friends of the Earth]] suggested when the party launched in 2003 that the motivation for the party was Duward's opposition to a tax on the extraction of [[construction aggregate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.scotsman.com/scotlandsnewparty/Doubts-grow-over-validity-of.2395591.jp|title=Doubts grow over validity of new party|last=Chamberlain|first=Gethin|date=22 January 2003|work=The Scotsman|accessdate=13 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Commercial passenger [[airliner]]s and [[cargo planes|cargo aircraft]] have been the subject of plots or attacks by bombs and fire since the near the start of air travel. Many early bombings were suicides or [[Insurance fraud|schemes for insurance money]], but in the latter part of the 20th century, assassination and political and religious militant terrorism became the dominant motive for attacking large jets. One list describes 86 cases related to airliner bombings, 53 of them resulting in deaths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aerospaceweb.org/question/planes/q0283.shtml|title=Aerospaceweb.org - Ask Us -  Commercial Airline Bombing History|publisher=|accessdate=17 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a '''chronological list of airliner bombing attacks'''. All entries on the list should have their own article. Explosions deemed to have not resulted from a bomb should not be included on this list. Bombings of small [[light aircraft]] and [[air taxi]]s and failed bombing plots may not be notable for inclusion. Commercial airliners contracted to military use may be included on this list, but bombings of [[military transport aircraft]] should not.

For airliners brought down by gunfire or missile attacks rather than terrorist bombings or sabotage, see [[List of airliner shootdown incidents]].

&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The University was established in 1973 and formally began its activities in 1976 following the signature of the permanent headquarters agreement between the United Nations and Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://treaties.un.org/Pages/showDetails.aspx?objid=0800000280102344|title=UNTC|work=un.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The creation of the United Nations University was set in motion by Secretary-General [[U Thant]] in 1969.&lt;ref name="UN_ARES2573XXIV"&gt;{{UN document |docid=A-RES-2573(XXIV) |type=Resolution |body=General Assembly |session=24 |resolution_number=2573 |accessdate=2008-05-02|date=13 December 1969|title=International university}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===UNU Institutes and Vice-Rectorate===
Over the years, several Institutes of UNU were created to help with the research initiatives of the United Nations. Most notably, in 2007, a vice-rectorate was established in Bonn (UNU-ViE), Germany, as a way of strengthening UNU's presence in Europe. UNU-ViE is dedicated to developing knowledge-based sustainable solutions for global problems and is, therefore, an active organizer of international science policy dialogues for sustainability.

===UNU as a degree-granting institution===

In December 2009, the [[UN General Assembly]] amended the UNU Charter to make it possible for UNU to "grant and confer master's degrees and doctorates, diplomas, certificates and other academic distinctions under conditions laid down for that purpose in the statutes by the Council."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unu.edu/about/charter#ART-1|title=UNU Charter|work=unu.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, UNU-ISP announced its intention to seek accreditation from the National Institution for Academic Degrees and University Evaluation (NIAD-UE) which is the Japanese accreditation agency for higher education institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://isp.unu.edu/about/jobs/2013/programme_administrative_consultant.html|title=Jobs {{!}} UNU Institute for Sustainability and Peace|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=|accessdate=14 September 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130922084737/http://isp.unu.edu/about/jobs/2013/programme_administrative_consultant.html|archivedate=22 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; UNU-IAS was formally accredited in April 2015, making it the first international organization to be recognized by the NIAD-UE.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://unu.edu/news/news/unu-ias-accredited-by-the-national-institution-for-academic-degrees-and-university-evaluation-japan.html|title=UNU-IAS Accredited by the National Institution for Academic Degrees and University Evaluation|last=|first=|date=May 1, 2015|website=unu.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2017-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Locations==
The university has several campuses spread over five continents. Its headquarters are located at the UNU Centre in Tokyo, Japan.

==Research ==

The role of the UN University is to generate new knowledge, educate, enhance individual and institutional capacities, and disseminate its useful information to relevant audiences. Within the scope of these five thematic clusters, the UN University undertakes:

*Cross-cultural, interdisciplinary research (utilizing innovative, science-based techniques and methodologies to study important global processes and elaborate forward-looking solutions) and targeted foresight and policy studies (aimed at developing policy-relevant prescriptions and evaluating the feasibility and comparative advantages of each option);
*Postgraduate-level education (degree-oriented programmes and specialized training focused on problems and solutions rather than academic disciplines) and capacity development activities (aimed at helping developing and transitional countries to enhance local potential to address current problems/confront emergent challenges); and
*Knowledge sharing and transfer (to deliver relevant information about UN University research, current scientific advances and best practices, in a timely manner and in a usable form, to those who most need it and can best utilize it).

As prescribed in the United Nations University Strategic Plan 2011–2014, the 26 major topics of focus of the UN University's academic work fall within five interdependent thematic clusters:
#Peace, Security and Human Rights; Peace building and peace keeping, Conflict resolution and human security, Fostering dialogue among civilizations, religions and cultures, Human rights and ethics, Gender equality and mainstreaming,
#Human and Socio-economic Development and Good Governance; Growth and economic development, Alleviating poverty and inequalities, Good governance, Enhancing educational capacities, Fair trade, Processes and consequences of regional integration and cooperation, Leadership, management and entrepreneurship.
#Global Health, Population and Sustainable Livelihoods; Global health, Safe water and sanitation, Food and nutrition for human and social development, Combating HIV/AIDS, Population changes and migration.
#Global Change and Sustainable Development; Climate change — adaptation and mitigation, Ecological health and biodiversity, New risk and vulnerabilities, Sustainable land, agriculture and natural resources management, Green economy.
#Science, Technology, Innovation and Society; Science, technology and innovation, Sustainable energy futures, Sustainable urban futures, Sustainable housing and construction.

Collectively, these thematic clusters define the programme space within which the UN University undertakes its academic activities. Some key perspectives (such as gender equality, human rights and sustainability) pervade all aspects of the UN University's work.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13536">The '''Women’s Equal Rights Law, 5711-1951''' was passed by the First Knesset of the State of Israel in order to explicitly guarantee the equal status of men and women in the newly established state. The law was enacted three years after Executive Chairman of the World Zionist Organization and Head of the Jewish Agency for Palestine, David Ben-Gurion, issued Israel’s Declaration of Independence, which promised “complete equality of social and political rights to all its inhabitants, irrespective of religion, race, or sex.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mfa.gov.il/mfa/foreignpolicy/peace/guide/pages/declaration%20of%20establishment%20of%20state%20of%20israel.aspx|title=Declaration of the Establishment of the State of Israel|last=|first=|date=May 14, 1948|website=Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since its inception, the Women’s Equal Rights Law, 5711-1951 has been met with both praise and criticism.

===Full Text===
English Version of Law:

#A man and woman shall have equal status with regard to any legal proceeding; any provision of the law which discriminates, with regard to any legal proceeding, against women and women, shall be of no effect.
# A married woman shall be fully competent to own and deal with property as if she were unmarried; her rights in property acquired to before marriage shall not be affected by her marriage.

(b) The Provisions of subsection (a) shall not derogate from the power of a competent court or tribunal to deal with matters of guardianship over the persons or property of children with the interest of the children as the sole consideration.
# (a) Notwithstanding anything contained in any other law, rights in an estate, being ''mulk'' land or movable property, shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of the Second Schedule or to the Succession Ordinance. (b) The provisions of subsection (a) shall apply to any estate the order for the distribution of which is made after the coming into force of this Law, even if the deceased died before such coming into force.

== Reception ==

=== Praise ===
Former Senior Deputy State Attorney for the Israeli Ministry of Justice Plea Albeck heralds the law for ensuring “most rights are enjoyed equally by men and women” and states “special provisions relating to women, for the most part, are regarded as benefits rather than disadvantages.”&lt;ref&gt;Albeck, Plea. “The Status of Women in Israel.” ''The American Journal of Comparative Law'', Vol. 20, No. 4 (Autumn, 1972): 693- 715. &lt;nowiki&gt;https://www.jstor.org/stable/839037&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; These “special provisions” grant women a “privileged status,” and include things such as women serve a shorter military service than men and mothers and pregnant women are exempt from service completely; married women are allowed to own and maintain property as if they were unmarried and their spouses have no claim to any profit from this property; and women are allowed to use contraceptives and seek a medical abortion without the consent of her husband.&lt;ref&gt;Albeck, Plea. “The Status of Women in Israel.” ''The American Journal of Comparative Law'', Vol. 20, No. 4 (Autumn, 1972): 693- 715. &lt;nowiki&gt;https://www.jstor.org/stable/839037&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; These examples of legal privileges for women are cited as positive outcomes of the Women’s Equal Rights Law. Albeck further explains in her 1972 article, “The Status of Women in Israel,” that the law is intended to both (1) ensure women share the same rights as men and (2) to preserve the special rights and privileges granted to women.&lt;ref&gt;Albeck, Plea. “The Status of Women in Israel.” ''The American Journal of Comparative Law'', Vol. 20, No. 4 (Autumn, 1972): 693- 715. &lt;nowiki&gt;https://www.jstor.org/stable/839037&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Criticism ===
While supporters of the law champion its provisions for ensuring special privileges for women, this section also garners criticism, as many aspects of “privileged status” come from religious law. [https://en.law.huji.ac.il/people/frances-raday Frances Raday], the currently head of the Concord Institute for the Study of the Absorption of International Law in Israel, explains “one of the main reasons for the demotion of the principle of equality in the Israeli legal system is deference to religious values.”&lt;ref&gt;Raday, Frances. “Women's Human Rights: Dichotomy between Religion and Secularism in Israel.” ''Israel Affairs'', 11, no. 1, (2005): 78-94. &lt;nowiki&gt;https://doi.org/10.1080/1353712042000324463&lt;/nowiki&gt; &lt;/ref&gt; The State of Israel identifies as a state that is both Jewish and Democratic, yet often finds its religious and political values at odds. Much of the criticism for the Women’s Equal Rights Law stems from the debate over religious versus secular democratic values. [http://www.bu.edu/law/profile/pnina-lahav/ Pnina Lahav], researcher and professor of law at Boston University, criticizes the law for both the “maintenance of religious jurisdiction over matters of marriage and divorce and the legitimation of a privileged status for women.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lahav|first=Pnina|date=1977|title=Raising the Status of Women through Law: The Case of Israel|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/3173092|journal=Signs|volume=3|issue=1|pages=193–209}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Criticism for the law largely stems from the notion that rather than foster true sex equality, the law’s declaration of a “privileged status” delineates women as “separate but equal.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lahav|first=Pnina|date=1974|title=The Status of Women in Israel-Myth and Reality|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/839057|journal=The American Journal of Comparative Law|volume=22|issue=1|pages=107–129|doi=10.2307/839057}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although people from across the religious and political spectrum applaud the law for guaranteeing a separate status for women, critics argue that this separate status undermines female equality. The term “equal” is used it is not understood the same as the term “equal” would be in the American sense of the word. The Israeli use of the term equal implies, according to feminist intellectual [[Catharine MacKinnon|Catherine MacKinnon]], the “Aristotelian notion that equality entails the treatment of likes alike and un-likes differently in accordance with their unlikeness”.&lt;ref name="Eisenstadt"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.vanderbilt.edu/jotl/manage/wp-content/uploads/Eisenstadt.pdf|title=Privileged but Equal? A Comparison of U.S. and Israeli Notions of Sex Equality in Employment Law|last1=Eisenstadt|first1=Leora F.|date=2007|publisher=Vaderbilt Transnational Law Vol. 40:357|pages=360|accessdate=18 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This interpretation of equality influences Israeli policy on gender equality and enabled the restrictive laws prohibiting women from entering combat positions in the [[Israeli Defense Forces]]. This "separate but equal" ideology also influenced Israel to create the Women's Corps [[Women's Affairs advisor]] as a separate unit.&lt;ref name="Halperin-Kaddari"&gt;{{cite book|title=Women in Israel: A State of Their Own|last1=Halperin-Kaddari|first1=Ruth|date=2004|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|location=Philadelphia|pages=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Legacy==
Israeli Law 5711-1951 has had a lasting legacy on the state of gender equality in Israel and Palestine. It has been revised once in 2000 updating much of the language and giving greater legal authority to the law. [[Halakha]] law remains the most difficult of equality issues to navigate today in Israel, even with the updated law 5711-1951. There is no civic marriage in Israel it must be done through the religious courts (Halakha, and [[Sharia]] law). However, in 2006 Gay Marriages done abroad were recognized as fit to be registered with the Official Registry in Israel, making what basically constitutes a "common law" marriage.&lt;ref name="Dotan, Yoav"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dotan|first1=Yoav|title=The Boundaries of Social Transformation through Litigation: Women's and LGBT Rights in Israel, 1970–2010|journal=Israel Law Review|date=January 29, 2015|volume=48|issue=1|page=10|doi=10.1017/S0021223714000284|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/download.php?file=%2F2046_44D5D47E9FC0D535FB3550605E42102E_journals__ISR_ISR48_01_S0021223714000284a.pdf&amp;cover=Y&amp;code=d00cf2df1a37feaf08c095f29250a990|accessdate=21 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Halima Brai v Qadi of the Sharia Muslim Court''===
In 1955, widowed mother of three Halima Bria, got remarried. Under Sharia Law (which she was married under and in Israel has legal authority in civil cases) a women with children who remarried was no longer seen in Israeli legal terms as the "natural guardian" for her very own children. She was brought to trial by her sister-in-law who was attempting to remove Halima's children from her custody. The only way in which Israeli law can trump a ruling by the religious courts (Islamic, Jewish, or Christian) is if the religious court "intentionally" ignored Law 5711-1951. The Israeli High Court did not side with Halima Bria and her children were removed from her custody.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Swirski|first1=Barbara|last2=Safir|first2=Marilyn P.|title=Calling the Equality Bluff: Women in Israel|date=1991|publisher=Pergamon Press|pages=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; This case was important because it set the legal standard of allowing the various religious courts to have what amounts to near full autonomy in their rulings. This separation of civil and criminal law still is a huge obstacle for those fighting for gender equality in Israel.
 
===''Steinberg v Attorney General''===
In 1951 shortly after 5711-1951 passed in the Knesset Israel's first sex discrimination case was brought to the High Court of Justice. In this case Haim Steinberg, who was part of the ultra-orthodox Jewish sect called Neturey-Karta, refused to serve in the new Israeli Defense Forces. His argument was that if he was a women of the Neturey-Karta sect he would be given a religious deferment, but because he was a man he was being denied that "right". The court rejected his appeal not because he was a man but on the grounds that his sect did not recognize the state of Israel as being legitimate or having any legal authority.&lt;ref name="Klosko, George"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Klosko|first1=George|title=Political Obligations|date=March 10, 2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|pages=170–171|accessdate=21 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This set important legal precedent for future cases of gender discrimination in the armed forces. It also put into layman's terms the Israel policy of favoring men in their military over women. Israel had/has many loopholes and ways for a women not wishing to serve to take, few such avenues are available for men in Israel.
   
===1986 Defense Service Law===
Was a Law that was amended in 1999 to allow all women access to any position in the Defense Forces that they qualify for. The Law stipulates that both men and women must perform military service for their country, however it is still far easier for a women to be exempted then it is for a man. Women can still be exempted for their own religious or conscientious reasons. They are then supposed to substitute military service for "national service" for their required two years, although this seems to be rarely implemented. Men are subjected to the IDF's discretion if they are allowed to be exempted or not.The only exception being those studying to be rabbis at the country's various [[yeshivas]].&lt;ref name=Halperin-Kaddari/&gt; These of course are male only and yet another source for dissatisfaction among those demanding gender equality in Israel.
