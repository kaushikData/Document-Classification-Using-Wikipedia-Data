'''''84, Charing Cross Road''''' is a 1970 book by [[Helene Hanff]], later made into a stage play, television play, and [[84 Charing Cross Road (film)|film]], about the twenty-year correspondence between the author and [[Frank Doel]], chief buyer of [[Marks &amp; Co]] antiquarian booksellers, located at the [[eponymous]] address in [[London]], England.

==Background==
Hanff was in search of obscure classics and British literature titles that she had been unable to find in [[New York City]] when she noticed an ad in the ''[[Saturday Review (US magazine)|Saturday Review of Literature]]''. She first contacted the shop in 1949 and it fell to Doel to fulfil her requests. In time, a long-distance friendship developed between the two and between Hanff and other staff members, as well, with an exchange of [[Christmas]] packages, birthday gifts and food parcels to help with the post-[[World War II]] [[Rationing in the United Kingdom#After World War II|food shortages in Britain]]. Their letters included discussions about topics as diverse as the sermons of [[John Donne]], how to make [[Yorkshire Pudding]], the [[Brooklyn Dodgers]] and the [[Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II|coronation of Elizabeth II]]. Hanff postponed visiting her English friends until too late; Doel died in December 1968 from [[peritonitis]] from a burst [[Vermiform appendix|appendix]], and the bookshop eventually closed in December 1970. Hanff did finally visit [[Charing Cross Road]] and the empty shop in the summer of 1971, a trip recorded in her 1973 book ''The Duchess of Bloomsbury Street''. 

==The shop's site today==
The five-story building where Marks &amp; Co. was located during the events of the book still exists {{nowrap|({{coord|51.51365|-0.12916|format=dms|type:landmark_region:GB}})}}. A circular brass plaque on a [[pilaster]] on the street frontage acknowledges the story and marks the site. The premises were occupied by a music and [[Compact disc|CD]] shop in the early 1990s, and later other retail outlets. In 2009 they housed a Med Kitchen restaurant; and now form part of a [[McDonald's]] restaurant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.84charingcrossroad.co.uk/hist2.html |title=A Brief History – Page 2|work=84charingcrossroad.co.uk|accessdate=20 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adaptations==

===Television===
[[Hugh Whitemore]] adapted ''84, Charing Cross Road'' for the BBC's ''[[Play for Today]]'', a television anthology series. It was first broadcast on 4 November 1975, starring [[Frank Finlay]] and [[Anne Jackson]].

===Theatre===
In 1981, [[James Roose-Evans]] adapted it for the stage in a two-character version first produced at the [[Salisbury Playhouse]] with [[Rosemary Leach]] and [[David Swift (actor)|David Swift]]. It transferred to the [[West End theatre|West End]], where it opened to universally ecstatic reviews.  A second production at the Playhouse ran from 5–28 February 2015, with [[Clive Francis]] and [[Janie Dee]] in the lead roles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=84 Charing Cross Road Programme|publisher=The Salisbury Playhouse|date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After fifteen previews, the [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] production opened to mixed reviews&lt;ref&gt;[http://theater2.nytimes.com/mem/theater/treview.html?res=9903EEDC1E39F93BA35751C1A964948260 ''New York Times'' review]&lt;/ref&gt; on 7 December 1982 at the [[Nederlander Theatre]] with [[Ellen Burstyn]] and [[Joseph Maher]]. It ran for 96 performances.

===Radio===
Virginia Browns adapted the story for BBC Radio drama, and it was broadcast on Radio 3 on 15 January 1976, with Margaret Robertson as Hanff and Lyndon Brook as Doel. The play was produced by Christopher Venning. 

James Roose-Evans again adapted the play for a 2007 radio production starring [[Gillian Anderson]] and [[Denis Lawson]], broadcast on Christmas Day on [[BBC Radio 4]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/nov/29/bbc.radio?gusrc=rss&amp;feed=media|title=X Files star Gillian Anderson to appear in Radio 4 play|author=John Plunkett|work=the Guardian|accessdate=20 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Film===
{{main|84 Charing Cross Road (film)}}
Whitemore returned to the project to write the [[screenplay]] for the [[84 Charing Cross Road (film)|1987 film adaptation]] starring [[Anne Bancroft]] and [[Anthony Hopkins]]. The ''dramatis personae'' were expanded to include Hanff's [[Manhattan]] friends, the bookshop staff, and Doel's wife Nora, played by [[Judi Dench]]. Bancroft won a [[BAFTA]] Award as Best Actress; Whitemore and Dench were nominated for Director and Supporting Actress, respectively.

The Chinese-Hong Kong film ''Book of Love'' or ''[[Finding Mr. Right 2]]'' (Chinese: 北京遇上西雅圖之不二情書) (2016) references, and is loosely inspired by, ''84, Charing Cross Road''.

The term '''Afro-Cuban''' refers to [[Cubans]] who mostly have [[West Africa]]n ancestry, and to historical or cultural elements in [[Cuba]] thought to emanate from this community. The term can refer to the combining of African and other cultural elements found in Cuban society such as [[Race (human classification)|race]], [[religion]], music, [[language]], the [[arts]], and [[social class|class]] culture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=Afro-Cuban&amp;r=66 The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language], Fourth Edition. Houghton Mifflin Company. Random House Unabridged Dictionary, Random House, Inc. 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demographics==
{{Main|Demographics of Cuba}}
According to a 2002 national census which surveyed 11.2 million Cubans, 1.1 million Cubans described themselves as [[Black people|Black]], while 5.8 million considered themselves to be "[[mulatto]]" or "[[mestizo]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cubagob.cu/otras_info/censo/tablas_html/ii_3.htm|title=Cuba census 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus a significant proportion of those living on the island affirm some African ancestry. The matter is further complicated by the fact that a fair number of people still locate their origins in specific African ethnic groups or regions, particularly the [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] (or [[Lucumí people|Lucumí]]), [[Akan people|Akan]], [[Arará]] and [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congo]], but also [[Igbo people|Igbo]], [[Efik people|Carabalí]], [[Mandinka people|Mandingo]], [[Kissi people|Kissi]], Fula, [[Makua (people)|Makua]] and others.

A study from 2014 estimated the [[genetic admixture]] of the population of Cuba to be 70% European, 22% African, and 8% Native American.&lt;ref&gt;Beatriz Marcheco-Teruel, Esteban J. Parra, Evelyn Fuentes-Smith, Antonio Salas, Henriette N. Buttenschøn, Ditte Demontis, María Torres-Español, Lilia C. Marín-Padrón, Enrique J. Gómez-Cabezas, Vanesa Álvarez-Iglesias, Ana Mosquera-Miguel, Antonio Martínez-Fuentes, Ángel Carracedo, Anders D. Børglum, Ole Mors, [http://www.plosgenetics.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pgen.1004488#pgen-1004488-g001 "Cuba: Exploring the History of Admixture and the Genetic Basis of Pigmentation Using Autosomal and Uniparental Markers"], July 24, 2014. PLOS Genetics.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Afro-Cubans can be found throughout Cuba, [[Oriente Province|Eastern Cuba]] has a higher concentration of blacks than other parts of the island, and [[Havana, Cuba|Havana]] has the largest population of blacks of any city in Cuba.&lt;ref name="OECD Data Sheet"&gt;OECD Data Sheet&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, many African immigrants have been coming to Cuba, especially from [[Angola]]. Also, immigrants from [[Jamaica]] and [[Haiti]] have been settling in Cuba, most of whom settle in the eastern part of the island, due to its proximity to their home countries, further contributing to the already high percentage of blacks on that side of the island.&lt;ref name="OECD Data Sheet"/&gt;
	
The percentage of Afro-Cubans on the island increased after the 1959 [[Cuban revolution]] led by [[Fidel Castro]] due to [[Cuban exile|mass migration from the island]] of the largely white Cuban professional class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://afrocubaweb.com/raceident.htm|title=Race &amp; Identity in Cuba|website=afrocubaweb.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; A small percentage of Afro-Cubans left Cuba, mostly for the United States, (particularly [[Florida]]), where they and their U.S.-born children are called [[Cuban Americans]], [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanic Americans]] and [[African Americans]]. Only a few of them resided in nearby Spanish-speaking country of [[Dominican Republic]] and the U.S. territory of [[Puerto Rico]].

The now-defunct Institute for Cuban and Cuban-American Studies at the University of Miami put the percentage of Cuba's black population at 62%.&lt;ref name="barrier"&gt;{{cite news|work=Miami Herald |url=http://www.miamiherald.com/multimedia/news/afrolatin/part4/index.html |title=A barrier for Cuba's black people – New attitudes on once-taboo race questions emerge with a fledgling black movement |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090701195606/http://www.miamiherald.com/multimedia/news/afrolatin/part4/index.html |archivedate=July 1, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Minority Rights Group International]] says that "An objective assessment of the situation of Afro-Cubans remains problematic due to scant records and a paucity of systematic studies both pre- and post-revolution".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.minorityrights.org/?lid=4116|title = Cuba – Afro-Cubans|date = 2008|accessdate = 29 December 2013|website = World Directory of Minorities and Indigenous Peoples|publisher = Minority Rights Group International}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Afro-Cuban descendants in Africa===
Countries such as [[Nigeria]], the home of the [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] and [[Igbo people|Igbo]] cultures, and [[Equatorial Guinea]] experienced an influx of ex-slaves from Cuba brought there as indentured servants during the 17th century, and again during the 19th century. In Equatorial Guinea, they became part of the ''[[Emancipados]]''; in Nigeria, they were called ''[[Saros (Nigeria)#Amaros in Lagos|Amaros]]''.  Despite being free to return to [[Cuba]] when their tenure was over, they remained in these countries marrying into the local indigenous population. The former slaves were brought to Africa by the ''Royal Orders of September 13, 1845'' (by way of voluntary arrangement) and a June 20, 1861, deportation from Cuba, due to the lack of volunteers. Similar circumstances previously occurred during the 17th century where ex-slaves from both [[Cuba]] and Brazil were offered the same opportunity.

[[Angola]] also has communities of Afro-Cubans, Amparos. They are descendants of Afro-Cuban soldiers brought to the country in 1975 as a result of the Cuban involvement in the [[Cold War]]. [[Fidel Castro]] deployed thousands of troops to the country during the [[Angolan Civil War]]. As a result of this era, there exists a small Spanish-speaking community in [[Angola]] of Afro-Cubans numbering about 100,000.

===Haitian-Cubans===
{{Main|Haitian Cuban}}
[[Haitian Creole]] and culture first entered Cuba with the arrival of Haitian immigrants at the start of the 19th century. Haiti was a French colony, and the final years of the 1791–1804 [[Haitian Revolution]] brought a wave of French settlers fleeing with their Haitian slaves to Cuba. They came mainly to the east, and especially [[Guantánamo]], where the French later introduced sugar cultivation, constructed sugar refineries and developed coffee plantations. By 1804, some 30,000 French were living in [[Baracoa]] and [[Maisí]], the furthest eastern municipalities of the province. Later, Haitians continued to come to Cuba to work as braceros (hand workers, from the Spanish word brazo, meaning "arm") in the fields cutting cane. Their living and working conditions were not much better than slavery. Although they planned to return to Haiti, most stayed on in Cuba. For years, many Haitians and their descendants in Cuba did not identify themselves as such or speak Creole. In the eastern part of the island, many Haitians suffered discrimination. 
After Spanish, Creole is the second most-spoken language in Cuba.  In addition to the eastern provinces, there are also communities in [[Ciego de Ávila]] and [[Camagüey]] provinces where the population still maintains Creole, their mother tongue. Classes in Creole are offered in Guantanamo, Matanzas and the City of Havana. There is a Creole-language radio program.

==Religion==
[[Image:Santeria.JPG|thumb|right|200px|[[Santería]] icons at an open place of worship in [[Havana]]. Santería is a [[syncretism]] practiced by many Afro-Cubans]]
Afro-Cuban religion can be broken down into three main currents: [[Santería]], [[Palo Monte]], and [[Abakuá]], and include individuals of all origins. Santería is syncretized with [[Catholicism|Roman Catholicism]].

The Abakuá religion is a secret society for men, similar to the freemason orders of Europe. It has not been syncretized with Roman Catholicism and remains close to its origins in southeastern [[Nigeria]] and southwestern [[Cameroon]], from the [[Ekpe]] society of the [[Efik people]] of [[Cross River State]] and nearby areas.

==Music==
{{Main|Music of African heritage in Cuba|Music of Cuba#African heritage}}
Afro-Cuban music involves two main categories of music, religious and profane. Religious music includes the chants, [[batá|rhythms]] and [[claves|instruments]] used in rituals of the above-mentioned religious currents, while profane music focuses largely on [[Cuban Rumba|rumba]], [[guaguancó]] and [[comparsa]] (carnival music) as well as several lesser styles such as the [[tumba francesa]]. Virtually all [[Music of Cuba|Cuban music]] has been influenced by African rhythms. Cuban popular music, and quite a lot of the art music, has strands from both Spain and Africa, woven into a unique Cuban cloth. The ''[[Son (music)|son]]'' is a typical example of this. While much of the music is often performed in cut-time, artists typically use an array of time signatures like 6/8 for drumming beats. [[Clave (rhythm)|Clave]], on the other hand, uses a polymetric 7/8 + 5/8 time signature &lt;ref&gt;King, Anthony (1961:14). ''Yoruba Sacred Music from Ekiti''. Ibadan University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Language==
Other cultural elements considered to be Afro-Cuban can be found in language (including syntax, vocabulary, and style of speech).

The Afro-Cuban religions all maintain some degree of use of African languages. [[Santería]] and [[Abakuá]] both have large parts of their liturgy in African languages ([[Lucumí language|Lucumí]], [[Igbo language|Igbo]] and Ñañigo, respectively) while [[Palo (religion)|Palo]] uses a mixture of [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Kikongo]], known as [[Habla Congo]].

==Racial consciousness==
{{main|Racism in Cuba}}
According to anthropologists dispatched by the [[European Union]], racism is entrenched in Cuba.&lt;ref name="obamaeffect"/&gt; Black people are systematically excluded from positions in tourism-related jobs, where they could earn tips in hard currencies.&lt;ref name="obamaeffect"/&gt; According to the EU study, black people are relegated to poor housing, and black Cubans are excluded from managerial positions.&lt;ref name="obamaeffect"&gt;{{cite web|date=December 15, 2008 |publisher=New America Media |title=‘Obama Effect’ Highlights Racism in Cuba |url=http://news.pacificnews.org/news/view_article.html?article_id=7b4ef8e52790034e043a37d170243f0f }}{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Enrique Patterson describes race as a "social bomb" and says that "If the Cuban government were to permit black Cubans to organize and raise their problems before [authorities] ... totalitarianism would fall".&lt;ref name="barrier"/&gt; Esteban Morales Domínguez, a professor at the University of Havana, says that "The absence of the debate on the racial problem already threatens ... the revolution's social project".&lt;ref name="barrier"/&gt; [[Carlos Moore (writer)|Carlos Moore]], who has written extensively on the issue, says that "There is an unstated threat, blacks in Cuba know that whenever you raise race in Cuba, you go to jail. Therefore the struggle in Cuba is different. There cannot be a civil rights movement. You will have instantly 10,000 black people dead. [...] The government is frightened to the extent to which it does not understand black Cubans today. You have a new generation of black Cubans who are looking at politics in another way."&lt;ref name="barrier"/&gt; [[Barack Obama]]'s victory has raised disturbing questions about the institutional racism in Cuba.&lt;ref name="obamaeffect"/&gt; ''[[The Economist]]'' noted "The danger starts with his example: after all, a young, black, progressive politician has no chance of reaching the highest office in Cuba, although a majority of the island's people are black"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=December 30, 2008|publisher=''The Economist''|title=Fifty years of the Castro regime – Time for a (long overdue) change|url=http://www.economist.com/opinion/displaystory.cfm?story_id=12853934}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the years between the triumph of the revolution and the victory at Playa Girón the Cuban government was one of the world's most proactive regimes in the fight against discrimination.  It achieved significant gains in racial equality through a series of egalitarian reforms early in the 1960s. [[Fidel Castro]]'s first public address on racism after his rise to power was on March 23, 1959, at a labor rally in Havana, less than three months after he defeated [[Fulgencio Batista]]. He is quoted as saying: "One of the most just battles that must be fought, a battle that must be emphasized more and more, which I might call the fourth battle--the battle to end racial discrimination at work centers. I repeat: the battle to end racial discrimination at work centers. Of all the forms of racial discrimination the worst is the one that limits the colored Cuban's access to jobs. "&lt;ref&gt;Speech at Havana Labor Rally . Transcript available on [http://www1.lanic.utexas.edu/project/castro/db/1959/19590323.html The University of Texas at Austin - Web Central]&lt;/ref&gt; Castro pointed to the distinction between social segregation and employment, while placing great emphasis on correcting the latter. In response to the large amount of racism that existed in the job market, Castro issued anti-discrimination laws. In addition, he attempted to close the class gap between wealthy white Cubans and Afro-Cubans with a massive literacy campaign among other egalitarian reforms in the early and mid-1960s.&lt;ref&gt;Perez, Louis A. ''Cuba: Between Reform and Revolution'', New York. 2006, p. 326.&lt;/ref&gt;
Two years after his 1959 speech at the Havana Labor Rally, Castro declared that the age of racism and discrimination was over. In a speech given at the [[Workers' Central Union of Cuba|Confederation of Cuban Workers]] in observance of [[International Workers' Day|May Day]], Castro declared that the "just laws of the revolution ended unemployment, put an end to villages without hospitals and schools, enacted laws which ended discrimination, control by monopolies, humiliation, and the suffering of the people."&lt;ref&gt;Speech given by Fidel Castro on April 8, 1961.  Text provided by Havana FIEL Network.&lt;/ref&gt; Although inspiring, many would consider the claim to be premature."&lt;ref name="Moore, C 1995"&gt;Moore, C. 1995. ''Afro-Cubans and the [[Communist Revolution]]''. Trenton, New Jersey: Africa World Press. Evidence collected in 2003 over proved.&lt;/ref&gt;

Research conducted by Yesilernis Peña, [[Jim Sidanius]] and Mark Sawyer in 2003, suggests that social discrimination is still prevalent, despite the low levels of economic discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;Pena, Y., Jim Sidanis and Mark Sawyer. 2003. ''Racial Democracy in the Americas: A Latin and US Comparison''. [[University of California]], Los Angeles.&lt;/ref&gt;
After considering the issue solved, the Cuban government moved beyond the issue of racism.  His message marked a shift in Cuban society's perception of racism that was triggered by the change in government focus."&lt;ref name="Moore, C 1995"/&gt;  The government's announcement easily allowed the Cuban public to deny discrimination without first correcting the stereotypes that remained in the minds of those who grew up in a Cuba that was racially and economically divided. Many who argue that racism does not exist in Cuba base their claims on the idea of Latin American [[Exceptionalism]]. According to the argument of Latin American Exceptionality, a social history of intermarriage and mixing of the races is unique to Latina America. The large [[mestizo]] populations that result from high levels of interracial union common to Latin America are often linked to [[racial democracy]]. For many Cubans this translates into an argument of "racial harmony", often referred to as racial democracy. In the case of Cuba, ideas of Latin American Exceptionalism have delayed the progress of true racial harmony.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Sawyer. ''Racial Politics in Post- Revolutionary Cuba''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the Latin population of [[Tampa, Florida|Tampa]] in the 1950s was working class and lived in restricted areas, ethnic enclaves in the vicinity of Tampa's hundreds of cigar factories. Black Cubans were tolerated to an extent in the Latin quarter (where most neighborhoods and cigar factories were integrated). [[Ybor City]] and its counterpart, [[West Tampa]], were areas that bordered on other restricted sections-areas for U.S. blacks or whites only. In this Latin quarter, there existed racial discrimination despite its subtleness.&lt;ref&gt;''Black Cuban, Black American''. Houston, Texas: Arte Publico Press, 130. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Afrocubanismo==
{{Main|Afrocubanismo}}
During the 1920s and 1930s Cuba experienced a movement geared towards Afro-Cuban culture called Afrocubanismo.&lt;ref&gt;Arnedo-Gómez, M. "Introduction." ''Writing Rumba''. Charlottesville: University of Virginia Press, 2006: 1.&lt;/ref&gt; The movement had a large impact on [[Cuban literature]], poetry, painting, music, and sculpture.  It was the first artistic campaign in [[Cuba]] that focused on one particular theme: black culture.  Specifically it highlighted the struggle for independence from Spain, black [[slavery]], and building a purely Cuban national identity.  Its goal was to incorporate African [[folklore]] and [[rhythm]] into traditional modes of art.

===History of the movement===
The movement evolved from an interest in the rediscovery of African heritage.  It developed in two very different and parallel stages.  One stage stemmed from European artists and intellectuals who were interested in African art and musical folk forms.&lt;ref&gt;"Afrocubanismo", ''Encyclopedia of World Literature in the 20th Century''. Ed. Lenard S Klein. Continuum: Continuum Publishing Company, 2008: 20.&lt;/ref&gt; This stage paralleled the [[Harlem Renaissance]] in New York, [[Négritude]] in the [[French Caribbean]], and coincided with stylistic European Vanguard (like Cubism and its representation of African masks).  It was characterized by the participation of white intellectuals such as Cubans [[Alejo Carpentier]], [[Rómulo Lachatañeré]], [[Fortunato Vizcarrondo]], [[Fernando Ortiz Fernández|Fernando Ortiz]] and [[Lydia Cabrera]], Puerto Rican [[Luis Palés Matos]] and Spaniards [[Pablo Picasso]] and [[Roger de Lauria]].  The African-inspired art tended to represent Afro-Cubans with cliché images such as a black man sitting beneath a palm tree with a cigar.

Poems and essays by black writers began to be published in the 1930s in newspapers, magazines and books, where they discussed their own personal heritage.  Afro-Cuban and Afro-Cuban heritage artists such as Nicolás Guillén, Alberto Arredondo and Emilio Ballagas brought light to the once-marginalized black race and culture.  It became a symbol of empowerment and individuality for Afro-Cubans within the established Western culture of the Americas and Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, R. "The Minorista Vanguard: Modernism and Afrocubanismo." ''Nationalizing Blackness: Afrocubanismo and artistic Revolution in Havana, 1920-1940''. Pittsburgh: University of Pittsburgh Press, 1997:200.&lt;/ref&gt;

This empowerment became a catalyst for the second stage to be characterized by Afro-Cuban artists making art that truly reflected what it meant to be Afro-Cuban. Beginning in the 1930s this stage depicted a more serious view of black culture like African religions and the struggles associated with slavery.  The main [[protagonist]] during this stage of the movement was [[Nicolás Guillén]].&lt;ref&gt;Henken, T. "Cuban Literature-The Avant-Garde vs the Vanguard: Colonial Literature", in ''Cuba: A Global Studies Handbook''. Santa Barbara: ABC_CLIO, 2008: 363.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Results of the movement===
The lasting reputation of the Afrocubanismo movement was the establishment of a [[New World]] art form that used aesthetics from both European and African culture.&lt;ref&gt;"Literature of the Revolutionary Era", ''Encyclopedia of Cuba: People, history, culture''. Ed. Luis Martinez Ternandez. Wesport: Greenwood Press, 2003: 345.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the actual movement of Afrocubanismo faded by the early 1940s, Afro-Cuban culture continues to play a vital role in the identity of Cuba.  It has been the [[Cuban Revolution]] that opened up a space for extended research of African ethnic roots in Cuba.&lt;ref&gt;Rodríguez-Mangual, E. "Introduction", ''Lydia Cabrera and the Construction of an Afro-Cuban Cultural Identity''. Chapel Hill: The University of North Carolina Press, 2004: 17.&lt;/ref&gt; The rhetoric of the Revolution incorporates black history and its contribution as an important [[stratum]] of Cuban identity.  The Revolution has funded many projects that restore the work of Afro-Cubans in an effort to accommodate an African-driven identity within the new anti-racist Cuban society.&lt;ref&gt;Rodríguez-Mangual, E. "Introduction", 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8456">The '''Al Jazeera effect''' is a term used in [[political science]] and [[media studies]] to describe the impact of [[new media]] and media sources on global politics, namely, reducing the government and mainstream media monopoly on information and empowering groups which previously lacked a global voice. The primary example is the effect's namesake – the impact of the [[Al Jazeera Media Network]] on the politics of the [[Arab world]]. {{citation needed|date=October 2018}}One of the most interesting facts about Al Jazeera is that it is supported by a Fascist Islamic Emir with Oil and Gas funds mainly from exports to unislamic countries, who in recent years has been a beacon of change everywhere except his own country.

==Origin and use==
Al Jazeera was created in 1996 with the combination of Emir of Qatar's money and talent from the defunct BBC Arabic service. It started as a response to the fact that governments in many countries from the Arab League strictly controlled most forms of newspaper and TV journalism, and there was a lack of free press available.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zingarelli|first=M|date=2010|title=The CNN effect and the Al-Jazeera effect in global politics and society|url=|journal=|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The viewing public did not respect journalism because it considered most reporters to be mouthpieces for dictators or political groups.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The Emir of Qatar sought to break the heavy handed media management by the government because he had progressive ideas of expanding political participation and allowing independent press.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Similarly, founders set up Al Jazeera to counter the dominant Western viewpoint of Arabs and Arabic culture throughout the 20th century. Arabs depended on the BBC and [[CNN International]] – but were frustrated they had to listen to the Western viewpoints about themselves.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; William Lafi Youmans attributes the first use of the term to Philip Seib, author of ''The Al Jazeera Effect: How the New Global Media Are Reshaping World Politics'' (2008).&lt;ref name="wly" /&gt; However, [[Simon Henderson]], who in turn attributes the term to "diplomats in the region", had used it as early as 2000.&lt;ref name="wi"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/view/the-al-jazeera-effect-arab-satellite-television-and-public-opinion |title=The 'al-Jazeera Effect': – The Washington Institute for Near East Policy |publisher=Washingtoninstitute.org |date=2000-12-08 |accessdate=2012-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; As used by Henderson, the Al Jazeera effect originally referred to Arab Middle East governments losing their [[State media|monopoly on information]] because of the popularity and easy access to the [[Al Jazeera]] [[satellite television]] media network,&lt;ref name="wi" /&gt; and scholars still often use it in such a limited context.&lt;ref name="SadriFlammia2011"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Houman A.|last1=Sadri|first2=Madelyn|last2=Flammia|title=Intercultural Communication: A New Approach to International Relations and Global Challenges|url=https://books.google.com/?id=zkK0YqB4cfQC&amp;pg=PA229|accessdate=24 October 2012|date=3 March 2011|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|isbn=978-1-4411-0309-3|page=229}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas L. McPhail used it to refer to the changes in all of the [[Arab media]].&lt;ref name="McPhail2010"&gt;{{cite book|first=Thomas L.|last=McPhail|title=Global Communication: Theories, Stakeholders, and Trends|url=https://books.google.com/?id=heEppDtfkNoC&amp;pg=PA290|accessdate=24 October 2012|date=16 March 2010|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-4443-3030-4|page=290}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seib generalized it to other, [[Internet]]-powered new media worldwide.&lt;ref name="wly" /&gt;

==Impact==
Al Jazeera ended the flow of information that followed the format of from the "West to the rest".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It follows a similar pattern to the CNN effect and includes the accelerant effect, impediment effect, and agenda-setting effect.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Seib noted that the Al Jazeera effect can be seen as parallel to the [[CNN effect]], which states that coverage of international events can force otherwise uninvolved governments to take action.&lt;ref name=wly/&gt; Whereas the CNN effect is used in the context of mainstream, traditional media networks such as [[CNN]], the Al Jazeera effect generalizes this to newer media such as [[citizen journalism|citizen journalist]] blogs, [[internet radio]], and [[satellite broadcasting]].&lt;ref name=wly/&gt; He also argues that new media strengthen the identity of and give voice to previously marginalized groups, which previously lacked their own media outlets; he cites the [[Kurdish people]] as an example.&lt;ref name=wly/&gt; Many of the new media organizations are affiliated with such groups, [[social movements]] or similar organizations. New media weaken the [[monopoly]] of many states on information, as even extensive [[Internet censorship]] in countries such as [[Internet censorship in the People's Republic of China|China]] is not wholly effective.&lt;ref name=wly/&gt; He concludes that the new media, while not beyond being abused, are largely contributing to [[democratization]] and [[political reform]] worldwide.&lt;ref name=wly/&gt; William Lafi Youmans notes that Seib's prediction that the Al Jazeera effect will lead to changes in the politics of the Middle East was realized in the early 2010s during the [[Arab Spring]], with new media provoking widespread debate and unrest within the region.&lt;ref name=wly&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia |first=William Lafi |last=Youmans |year=2013 |title=Al Jazeera Effect |url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00PYG9484/ |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Social Media and Politics |editor1-last=Kerric |editor1-first=Harvey |location=Los Angeles |publisher=CQ Press/SAGE Reference |pages=41–43 |isbn=9781483389004}} Search for "Al Jazeera effect".&lt;/ref&gt; The CNN effect and Al Jazeera effect have had a tremendous impact on policies and the government. They have both influenced foreign policies of the US. the existence of such news organizations is crucial for having global communications and is promising in terms of spreading democracy.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Subaltern ==
The Al Jazeera effect has also been referred to as a subaltern, in reference to [[Subaltern (postcolonialism)|Subaltern (post colonialism)]]. Subaltern, depending on the context and where the subaltern is present, resembles something of opposition to the status quo through the demographic that does not have the capital to have their voices be heard; this form of ''alternative media'' gives a "voice to the voiceless." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Chapter 6, Can the Subaltern Speak?|last = Sharp|first = J|date = 2008|journal = Geographies of Postcolonialism|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; This notion of the subaltern is discussed by scholars, such as [[Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak]].

In [[Greek mythology]], '''Amazonomachy''' ([[English language|English translation]]: "Amazon battle"; plural, '''Amazonomachiai''' ({{lang-grc|Ἀμαζονομαχίαι}}) or '''Amazonomachies''') was one of various mythical battles between the Ancient [[Greeks]] and the [[Amazons]], a nation of all-female warriors. Many of the myths portrayed were that of [[Heracles]]' ninth labor, which was the retrieval of the girdle of [[Hippolyta]], Queen of the Amazons, and of [[Theseus]]' abduction of Hippolyta, whom he claimed as his wife. Another famous scene portrayed is that of [[Achilles]]' victorious battle against [[Penthesilea]] during the [[Trojan war]].

The subject was popular in [[ancient Greek art]] and [[Roman art]].

==Symbolism of Amazonomachy==
[[File:Amazonomachy Met 31.11.13.jpg|thumb|Detail of vase, c. 420 BC]]
Amazonomachy represents the Greek ideal of civilization. The Amazons were portrayed as a savage and barbaric race, while the Greeks were portrayed as a civilized race of human progress. 
According to [[Bruno Snell]]'s view of Amazonomachy

&lt;blockquote&gt;For the Greeks, the [[Titanomachy]] and the battle against the giants remained symbols of the victory which their own world had won over a strange universe; along with the battles against the Amazons and [[Centaur]]s they continue to signalize the Greek conquest of everything barbarous, of all monstrosity and grossness.&lt;ref&gt;DuBois, Page (1982). ''Centaurs and Amazons: Women and the Pre-History of the Great Chain of Being''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[File:Produzione greca o magnogreca, sarcofago dipinto delle amazzoni, 350-325 a.C. ca, da tarquinia 09.jpg|thumb|Detail from painted [[sarcophagus]] found in Italy, 350-325 BC]]

Amazonomachy is also seen as the rise of [[feminism]] in Greek culture. In [[Quintus Smyrnaeus]]'s ''The Fall of Troy'', Penthesilea, an Amazonian queen, who joined on the side of the [[Troy|Trojan]]s during the Trojan war, was quoted at [[Troy]], saying:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Not in strength are we inferior to men; the same our eyes, our limbs the same; one common light we see, one air we breathe; nor different is the food we eat. What then denied to us hath heaven on man bestowed?&lt;ref&gt;Quintus Smyrnaeus. "The Fall of Troy." Translated by Way. A. S. Loeb Classical Library Volume 19. London: William Heinemann, 1913.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to [[Josine Blok]], Amazonomachy provides two different contexts in defining a Greek hero. Either the Amazons are one of the disasters from which the hero rids the country after his victory over a monster; or they are an expression of the underlying [[Attis]] motif, in which the hero shuns human sexuality in marriage and procreation.&lt;ref&gt;[[Josine Blok|Blok, Josine]] (1994). ''The Early Amazons: Modern and Ancient Perspectives on a Persistent Myth''&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 5th century, the [[Achaemenid Empire]] of [[Persia]] began a series of [[Greco-Persian Wars|invasions against Ancient Greece]]. Because of this, some scholars believe that on most 5th-century Greek art, the Persians were shown allegorically, through the figure of centaurs and Amazons.&lt;ref&gt;DuBois, Page (1982). ''Centaurs and Amazons: Women and the Pre-History of the Great Chain of Being''&lt;/ref&gt;

==In art==
Warfare was a very [[Warfare in ancient Greek art|popular subject in Ancient Greek art]], represented in grand sculptural scenes on temples but also countless [[Greek vases]].  On the whole fictional and mythical battles were preferred as subjects to the many historical ones available. Along with scenes from [[Homer]] and the [[Giants_(Greek_mythology)#The_Gigantomachy|Gigantomachy]], a battle between the race of Giants and the Olympian gods, the Amazonomachy was a [[Amazons#In_art|popular choice]].

Later, in [[Roman art]], there are many depictions on the sides of later Roman [[sarcophagus|sarcophagi]], when it became the fashion to depict elaborate reliefs of battle scenes.  Scenes were also shown on mosaics.  A trickle of medieval depictions increased at the Renaissance, and especially in the [[Baroque]] period.

===West metopes of Parthenon===
Kalamis, a Greek sculptor, is attributed to designing the west [[metope (architecture)|metope]]s of the [[Parthenon]], a temple on the [[Acropolis of Athens|Athenian Acropolis]] dedicated to the Greek goddess [[Athena]].&lt;ref name="Neils2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jenifer Neils|title=The Parthenon: From Antiquity to the Present|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gA81kINAI9cC&amp;pg=PA67|date=5 September 2005|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-82093-6|page=67|quote=The Parthenon (Plate 1, Fig. 17) is probably the most celebrated of all Greek temples. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HambidgeFund1924"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jay Hambidge|author2=Yale University. Rutherford Trowbridge Memorial Publication Fund|title=The Parthenon and other Greek temples: their dynamic symmetry|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xH9TAAAAMAAJ|year=1924|publisher=Yale university press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The west metopes of the Parthenon depict a battle between Greeks and Amazons. Despite its mutilated state, scholars generally concur that the scene represents the Amazon invasion of [[Attica]].&lt;ref&gt;Castriota, David (1992). ''Myth, Ethos, and Actuality: Official Art in Fifth Century B.C. Athens''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shield of Athena Parthenos===
The shield of [[Athena Parthenos]], sculpted by [[Phidias]], depicts a fallen Amazon. Athena Parthenos was a massive [[chryselephantine]] sculpture of Athena, the main [[cult image]] inside the [[Parthenon]] at Athens, which is now lost, though known from descriptions and small ancient copies.&lt;ref&gt;Castriota, David (1992). ''Myth, Ethos, and Actuality: Official Art in Fifth Century B.C. Athens''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bassae Frieze in Temple of Apollo===
[[File:The Bassai sculptures, marble block from the frieze of the Temple of Apollo Epikourios at Bassae (Greece), Greeks fight Amazons, about 420-400 BC, British Museum (14073518379).jpg|thumb|left|Block from the [[Bassae Frieze]], c. 420-400 BC]]
The [[Bassae Frieze]] in the Temple of [[Apollo]] at [[Bassae]] contains a number of slabs portraying Trojan Amazonomachy and Heraclean Amazonomachy. The Trojan Amazonomachy spans three blocks, displaying the eventual death of Penthesilea at the hands of Achilles. The Heraclean Amazonomachy spans eight blocks and represents the struggle of Heracles to seize the belt of the Amazon queen Hippolyta.&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, Frederick (1992). ''The Temple of Apollo Bassitas: The Sculpture, Volume 2''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Amazonomachy frieze from Mausoleum at Halicarnassus===
[[File:Amazon Frieze BM GR 1865.7-23.1 n01.jpg|thumb|[[Mausoleum at Halicarnassus]]]]
Several sections of an Amazonomachy [[frieze]] from the [[Mausoleum at Halicarnassus]] are now in the [[British Museum]].  One part depicts [[Heracles]] grasping an Amazon by the hair, while holding a club behind his head in a striking manner. This Amazon is believed to be the Amazon queen [[Hippolyta]]. Behind Heracles is a scene of a Greek warrior clashing shields with an Amazon warrior. Another slab displays a mounted Amazon charging at a Greek, who is defending himself with a raised shield. This Greek is believed to be [[Theseus]], who joined Heracles during his labours.

===Other===
[[Micon]] painted the Amazonomachy on the [[Stoa Poikile]] of the [[Ancient Agora of Athens]], which is now lost.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/biography/Micon#ref291408 Micon-Britannica]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Phidias]] depicted Amazonomachy on the footstool of the [[chryselephantine statue of Zeus]] at [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Woodard| first = Roger D.| title = The Cambridge Companion to Greek Mythology| url = https://books.google.gr/books?id=TQyRX6WmMUMC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=el#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false| publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]]|date=January 2008| page = 298| isbn = 978-0521607261}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, archaeologists discovered relief-decorated shoulder boards made from bronze that were part of a [[breastplate]] of a Greek warrior at a Celtic sacrificial place near the village of [[Slatina nad Bebravou]] in [[Slovakia]]. Deputy of director of Slovak Archaeological Institute said that it is the oldest original Greek art relic in the area of Slovakia. Researchers analyzed the pieces and determined they were once part of a relief that depicted the Amazonomachy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://spectator.sme.sk/c/20822300/archaeologists-find-oldest-greek-relic-in-slovak-area.html Archaeologists find oldest Greek relic in Slovak area]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Antigonia''' ({{lang-el|Αντιγόνεια}}) also [[transliterated]] as '''Antigonea''' and '''Antigoneia''' was a [[Hellenistic]] city in [[Seleucid Empire]], [[Syria]] (in modern [[Turkey]]), on the [[Orontes river|Orontes]], founded by [[Antigonus I Monophthalmus]] in 307 BC, and intended to be the capital of his empire; the site is approximately 7&amp;nbsp;km northeast of [[Antakya]], [[Hatay Province]], [[Turkey]]. After the [[Battle of Ipsus]], 301 BC, in which Antigonus perished, the inhabitants of Antigonia were removed by his successful rival [[Seleucus I Nicator]] to the city of [[Antioch]], which Seleucus founded a little lower down the river. ([[Strabo]] xvi. p.&amp;nbsp;750; [[Diodorus Siculus|Diod.]] xx. 47; Liban. Antioch. p.&amp;nbsp;349; Malalas, p.&amp;nbsp;256.) Diodorus erroneously says that the inhabitants were removed to [[Seleucia Pieria]]. Antigonia continued, however, to exist, and is mentioned in the war with the [[Parthia]]ns after the defeat of [[Crassus]]. ([[Cassius Dio|Dion Cass.]] xl. 29.)

'''Athena SWAN''' (Scientific Women’s Academic Network) is a charter established and managed by the British [[Equality Challenge Unit]] in 2005&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Home page |url=http://www.ecu.ac.uk/  |website=ecu.ac.uk |date=|publisher=Equality Challenge Unit |accessdate=14 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; that recognises and celebrates good practice towards the advancement of [[gender equality]]: representation, progression and success for all.

== Background ==
The Athena SWAN charter was established to encourage and recognise commitment to advancing the careers of women in [[science, technology, engineering, and mathematics]] (STEM) employment in higher education and research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Solomon | first = Tom | title = How to create a better future for women in science | url = https://www.theguardian.com/women-in-leadership/2014/nov/26/women-in-science-athena-swan-charter | work = [[The Guardian]] | date = 26 November 2014 | access-date = 20 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Expansion ==
In May 2015 the charter was expanded to include non-STEM schools, professional and support staff, technical staff, and trans staff and students. The first awards to non-STEM university departments were announced in April 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Grove | first = Jack | title = First non-STEM Athena SWAN winners named | url = https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/first-non-stem-athena-swan-winners-named | work = [[Times Higher Education]] | date = 28 April 2016 | access-date = 20 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The charter also recognises work undertaken to address gender equality more broadly, and not just barriers to progression that affect women.&lt;ref name="AS_Charter"&gt;{{cite web | title = Athena SWAN Charter |url=http://www.ecu.ac.uk/equality-charters/athena-swan/ |website=ecu.ac.uk |date=|publisher=Equality Challenge Unit |accessdate=14 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Award details ==
Members who sign up to the charter are expected to apply for an Athena SWAN award,&lt;ref name="AS_Charter" /&gt; at Bronze, Silver or Gold level. Each award is valid for four years under the post-2015 rules (three years where pre-2015 rules apply).

They commit to adopting ten principles,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = About ECU’s Athena SWAN Charter  |url= http://www.ecu.ac.uk/equality-charters/athena-swan/about-athena-swan/ |website=ecu.ac.uk |date=|publisher=Equality Challenge Unit |accessdate=11 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; which focus on promoting and supporting gender equality for women. In particular, the charter aims to address what is known as the “leaky pipeline” of women progressing to senior roles in science by removing obstacles to their advancement, ensuring equal pay and mainstreaming support, through action at all levels across the department or organisation.

== Reception ==
An exploratory study of women's and men's perceptions of Athena SWAN was broadly positive and highlighted the significance of government funding being linked to SWAN awards, but it also highlighted the limitations of whether the process can change longstanding and entrenched issues in society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ovseiko | first1 = Pavel V. | last2 = Chapple | first2 = Alison | last3 = Edmunds | first3 = Laurel D. | last4 = Ziebland | first4 = Sue | title = Advancing gender equality through the Athena SWAN Charter for Women in Science: an exploratory study of women's and men's perceptions | journal = [[BioMed Central#BMC journal series|Health Research Policy and Systems]] | volume = 15 | page = 12 | publisher = [[BioMed Central|BMC]] | doi = 10.1186/s12961-017-0177-9 | date = 21 February 2017 | url = https://doi.org/10.1186/s12961-017-0177-9 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout history, printers' errors and peculiar translations have appeared in [[Bible]]s published throughout the world.

==Manuscript Bibles==
[[File:KellsFol201rGeneolgyOfChrist.jpg|thumb|200px|right|A page from the [[genealogy of Jesus]], in [[Book of Kells|Kells]]]]

===The Book of Kells, circa 800===
{{main|Book of Kells}}
* The [[genealogy of Jesus]], in the [[Gospel of Luke]], has an extra ancestor at Luke 3:26 (the second name on this illustrated page). The reason for this error is that the transcriber of the Book of Kells read "QUI FUIT MATHATHIAE" as "QUI FUIT MATHATH | IAE," in which he considered ''IAE'' an additional individual (and so he added another QUI FUIT), rather than the Latin ending of "Matthew."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sullivan|first=Edward|title=The Book of Kells|year=1920|publisher=The Studio|pages=120|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/celt/bok/bok20.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 10:34b should read ''"I came [[But to bring a sword|not to send peace, but the sword]]"''.  However rather than "[[gladius|gladium]]" which means "[[sword]]", Kells has "gaudium" meaning "[[joy]]".  Rendering the verse: {{nowrap|''"I came not [only] to send peace, but [also] joy".''}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nathan|first=George Jean Nathan|title=The American Mercury|year=1951|pages=572|url=https://books.google.com/?id=pXgWAQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=%22refused%20to%20adopt%20St.%20Jerome's%20phrase%22|author2=Henry Louis Mencken|quote=The compilers of the late seventh century manuscript, The Book of Kells, refused to adopt St. Jerome's phrase "I come not to bring peace but a sword." (" . . . non pacem sed gladium.")To them the phrase made no sense and they altered it ...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Book of Deer, 10th-century===
The [[Book of Deer]] has a number of errors.  In the genealogy of Jesus in the Gospel of Luke, it has Seth as the first man and grandfather of Adam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stuart|first=John|title=The Book of Deer |year=1869|publisher=Spalding club|pages=xxxii|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LmMLAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PR32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Printed Bibles==
===Coverdale===
* '''"Bug Bible"''': [[Myles Coverdale]]'s 1535 Bible was known as the "Bug Bible" because the fifth verse of [[Psalm 91]] read: "Thou shall not nede to be afrayed for eny bugges by night". A competing claim to authorship comes from Stauffer's "The Queer, the Quaint, and the Quizzical", written in 1882.  In this book, Stauffer claims that the Bug Bible was "printed by John Daye, 1551, with a prologue by Tyndall."&lt;ref&gt;Stauffer - The Queer, The Quaint, &amp; The Quizzical, 1882, p. 8, Francis Henry Shauffer&lt;/ref&gt; The "Bug Bible" has also been claimed to have been written In Middle English, in which the word "[[Boggart|bugge]]" meant a "spectre that haunts" or a [[ghost]].&lt;ref name="McNab"&gt;McNab, Chris. ''Ancient Legends/Folklore.'' New York : Scholastic, Inc., 2007. ({{ISBN|0-439-85479-2}})&lt;/ref&gt; The [[King James Bible]] used the word "terror". The term was actually first used by [[George Joye]], whose translations of the [[Psalms]] were seen through the press by Coverdale before he translated the Old Testament.&lt;ref name="Butterworth"&gt;Charles C. BUTTERWORTH, &amp; Allan G. CHESTER, George Joye (1495?–1553). A Chapter in the History of the English Bible and the English Reformation, Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1962, pp. 139–142; p. 145. n. 25. Gerald HOBBS, "Martin Bucer and the Englishing of the Psalms: Pseudonimity in the Service of Early English Protestant Piety", in D.F. WRIGHT (ed.), Martin Bucer. Reforming Church and Community, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1994, pp. 169–170.)&lt;/ref&gt; This use of the word "bug" was repeated in the 1539 Great Bible and in Matthew's Bible, 1551.

=== Edmund Becke's Bibles ===
*'''"Wife-Beater's Bible" (1549; 1551)''': A footnote to [[I Peter]] 3:7, inserted by [[Edmund Becke|Becke]], reads "And if she be not obediente and healpeful unto hym, endevoureth to beate the fere of God into her heade, that thereby she may be compelled to learne her dutye and do it."&lt;ref name="Metzger2001"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pkB7pDKa_ZkC&amp;lpg=PA1&amp;vq=P64&amp;pg=PA1#v=snippet&amp;q=P%2064&amp;f=false|title=The Bible in Translation: Ancient and English versions|last=Metzger|first=Bruce M.|publisher=Baker Academic|year=2001|isbn=9780801022821|edition=Pbk.|location=Grand Rapids, MI|page=64|pages=|authorlink=Bruce M.

===The Great Bible===
[[File:Treacle Bible, St Mary’s, Banbury.jpg|thumb|right|The Treacle Bible opened at the page of the eponymous curiosity. St&amp;nbsp;Mary's Church, [[Banbury]].]]
* '''"Treacle Bible"''' (Beck's Bible): In the 1549 edition of the [[Great Bible]], [[Jeremiah]] 8:22 was translated "Is there no tryacle [treacle] in Gilead?" Modern translations usually render צֹ֫רִי (''tsorî'') as "[[Liniment|balm]]" or "medicine" instead. In [[Early Modern English]], "[[treacle]]" could mean "a cure-all" as well as "[[molasses]]."

===Geneva===
* '''"Breeches Bible"''' 1579: Whittingham, Gilby, and Sampson: translated in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 3:7 as "and they sowed figge-tree leaves together, and made themselves breeches." (This less precise translation was glossed in the margin with a more accurate, albeit longer, translation.) The accepted meaning of חֲגֹרֹֽת (''ḥăḡōrōṯ'') is "coverings" (the KJV has "aprons").
* '''"Place-makers' Bible"''' 1562: the second edition of the [[Geneva Bible]], [[Beatitudes|Matthew 5:9]] reads "Blessed are the placemakers: for they shall be called the children of God"; it should read "peacemakers".
** In its chapter heading for Luke 21 it has "Christ condemneth the poor widow" rather than "commendeth".
** The 1589 Geneva Bible, Chapter 24:15 in the gospel of Matthew that reads, "When ye therefore shal se the [[abomination of desolation]] spoken of by David the prophet..." It should read, "Daniel the prophet."{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

===Douai===
* '''"Rosin Bible"''' 1610: Jeremiah 8:22 reads "Is there noe rosen in Galaad?". "[[Rosin]]" is a brittle and sticky substance used on the [[bow (music)|bows]] of [[stringed instruments]] to provide friction with the strings. (The AKJV has a note at Ezekiel giving "rosin" as an alternative to "balme")
* '''"Manchester edition"''' 1793: The heading on Chapter 3 of Leviticus and the first verse has "bees" rather than "beeves" (plural of beef).  It reads: ''"How the pacifique hosts must be of bees, sheep, lambs and goats"'' ("pacifique hosts" = "peace offerings")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1409/1424529493_aeaafaad84_o.jpg|format=JPG|title=Photographic image of page of the Bible|publisher=Farm2.static.flickr.com|accessdate=21 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===King James===
[[Image:Wickedbible.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Wicked Bible]] renders Exodus 20:14 as "thou shalt commit adultery".]]
[[Image:Judas Bible2.jpg|thumb|left|The Judas Bible in St. Mary's Church, [[Totnes]], [[Devon]], UK. This is a copy of the second folio edition of the Authorized Version, printed by [[Robert Barker (printer)|Robert Barker]], Printer to King James I, in 1613, and given to the church for the use of the Mayor of Totnes. This edition is known as the Judas Bible because in Matthew 26:36 "Judas" appears instead of "Jesus". In this copy the mistake (in red circle) is corrected with a slip of paper pasted over the misprint.&lt;ref&gt;According to a note in St Mary's Church, Totnes, Cornwall, UK&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In various printings of the [[King James Version|King James Version of the Bible]], some of the more famous examples have been given their own names. Among them are:
* '''The Blasphemous Comma''': Several editions: Luke 23:32 reads "And there were also two other malefactors [crucified with Jesus]." It should have read "And there were also two others''',''' malefactors."
* '''"Judas Bible"''', from 1613: This Bible has Judas, not Jesus, saying "Sit ye here while I go yonder and pray." ([[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 26:36)
* '''"Printers Bible"''', from 1612: In some copies [[Psalm]] 119:161 reads "Printers have persecuted me without a cause" rather than "''Princes'' have persecuted me..."
* '''"[[Wicked Bible]]"''', '''"Adulterous Bible"''' or '''"Sinner's Bible"''', from 1631: Barker and Lucas: Omits an important "not" from [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 20:14, making the [[Ten Commandments|seventh commandment]] read "Thou shalt commit adultery." The printers were fined £300 and most of the copies were recalled immediately. Only 11 copies are known to exist today.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}
* '''"More Sea Bible"''', from 1641: "...the first heaven and the first earth were passed away and there was more sea" rather than "...the first heaven and the first earth were passed away and there was no more sea." ([[Book of Revelation|Revelation]] 21:1)
* '''"{{vanchor|Unrighteous Bible}}"''' or '''"Wicked Bible"''', from 1653: Cambridge Press: Another edition carrying this title omits a "not" before the word "inherit", making [[First Epistle to the Corinthians|I Corinthians]] 6:9 read "Know ye not that the unrighteous shall inherit the kingdom of God?..." In addition, [[Epistle to the Romans|Romans]] 6:13 reads "Neither yield ye your members as instruments of righteousness into sin..." where it should read "unrighteousness".
* '''"Sin On Bible"''', from 1716: Jeremiah 31:34&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Paul|first=William E.|date=April–June 2003|title=Curiosities in Bible Editions|url=http://www.biblecollectors.org/articles/curiosities.htm|journal=Bible Editions &amp; Versions|accessdate=March 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; reads "sin on more" rather than "sin no more".
* '''"Vinegar Bible"''', from 1717: J. Baskett, Clarendon Press: The chapter heading for [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] 20 reads "The Parable of the Vinegar" instead of "The Parable of the Vineyard." One reviewer called this particular edition "a Baskett full of errors," what with its being replete with numerous other specimens of typographical errata throughout. One copy sold for $5,000 in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.anglicanjournal.com/vinegar-bible-returns-to-lunenburg-8107/|title='Vinegar Bible' returns to Lunenburg|last=|first=|date=2008-10-01|work=Anglican Journal|accessdate=2008-10-15|issue=8|volume=134|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''"The Fools Bible"''', from 1763: [[Psalm]] 14:1 reads "the fool hath said in his heart there is a God", rather than "...there is no God". The printers were fined £3,000 and all copies ordered destroyed.{{cn|date=October 2016}}
* '''"Denial Bible"''', from 1792: The name Philip is substituted for Peter as the apostle who would deny Jesus in [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] 22:34.
* '''"Murderer's Bible"''', from 1801: "Murmurers" is printed as "murderers", making [[Epistle of Jude|Jude]] 16 read: "These are murderers, complainers, walking after their own lusts; and their mouth speaketh great swelling words, having men's persons in admiration because of advantage."
* '''"Lions Bible"''', from 1804: 1 [[Books of Kings|Kings]] 8:19 reads "thy son that shall come forth out of thy lions", rather than "loins". This edition had another error in [[Book of Numbers|Numbers]] 35:18 which read: "The murderer shall surely be put together" rather than "...put to death".
* '''"To-remain Bible"''', from 1805: In [[Epistle to the Galatians|Galatians]] 4:29 a proof-reader had written in "to remain" in the margin, as an answer to whether a comma should be deleted. The note inadvertently became part of the text, making the edition read "But as then he that was born after the flesh persecuted him that was born after the Spirit to remain, even so it is now."
* '''"Discharge Bible"''', from 1806: "Discharge" replaces "charge" making [[First Epistle to Timothy|I Timothy]] 5:21 read "I discharge thee before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, and the elect angels, that thou observe these things without preferring one before another, doing nothing by partiality."
* '''"Standing Fishes Bible"''', from 1806: "Fishes" replaced "fishers" making [[Book of Ezekiel|Ezekiel]] 47:10 read "And it shall come to pass, that the fishes shall stand upon it from Engedi even unto Eneglaim; they shall be a place to spread forth nets; their fish shall be according to their kinds, as the fish of the great sea, exceeding many."
* '''"Idle Shepherd"''', from 1809: [[Book of Zechariah|Zechariah]] 11:17 reads "the idle shepherd" rather than "idol shepherd".
* '''"Ears To Ear Bible"''', from 1810: Edition which makes [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 13:43 read: "...Who has ears to ear, let him hear." The correct phrase should be "ears to hear". In the same edition, Hebrews 9:14 comes out as "How much more shall the blood of Christ ... purge your conscience from good works [should be "dead works"] to serve the living God." 
* '''"Wife-hater Bible"''', from 1810: "Wife" replaces "life" in this edition, making [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] 14:26 redundantly read "If any man come to me, and hate not his father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brethren, and sisters, yea, and his own wife also, he cannot be my disciple."
* '''"The Large Family Bible"''', from 1820: [[Isaiah]] 66:9 reads: "Shall I bring to birth and not cease to bring forth?" rather than "Shall I bring to birth and not cause to bring forth?".
* '''"Rebecca's Camels Bible"''', from 1823: "Camels" replaces "damsels" in one instance, making [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 24:61 read "And Rebecca arose, and her camels, and they rode upon the camels, and followed the man: and the servant took Rebecca and went his way."
* '''"Affinity Bible"''', from 1927: Contains a table of family affinities that includes the line "A man may not marry his grandmother's wife."
* '''"Owl Bible"''', from 1944: "Owl" replaces "own", making [[First Epistle of Peter|1 Peter]] 3:5 read, "For after this manner in the old time the holy women also, who trusted God, adorned themselves, being in subjection to their owl husbands." The error was caused by a printing plate with a damaged letter ''n''.

==Fictional Bible errata==
* In the novel ''[[Good Omens]]'', [[Neil Gaiman]] and [[Terry Pratchett]] created the '''"Buggre Alle This Bible"''' of 1651 (and the '''Charing Cross Bible'''). The typesetter replaced [[Book of Ezekiel|Ezekiel]] 48:5 with a rant complaining about his job. It also has three extra verses at the end of [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 3 about the loss of the [[Flaming sword (mythology)|flaming sword]] by the [[angel]] Aziraphale, added by Aziraphale himself, a character in the story. 
* In the BBC science-fiction sitcom ''[[Red Dwarf]]'', one of the main characters, [[Arnold Rimmer]], tells of his family belonging to an obscure fundamentalist Christian sect, the "Seventh Day Advent Hoppists". According to Rimmer – who is revealed in another episode to have the middle name [[Judas]] due to his parents' unconventional take on Christianity – the Hoppists' unique form of worship arose from a misprinted Bible wherein [[1 Corinthians]] 13:13 reads "Faith, hop and charity, and the greatest of these is hop." The membership consequently spent every Sunday hopping. Rimmer says he never agreed with the faith, but claims to be liberal on religious matters.
* ''[[The Poisonwood Bible]]'' is a 1998 bestselling novel by [[Barbara Kingsolver]] which mentions some of the famous "misprint Bibles" such as the ''Camel Bible'', the ''Murderer's Bible'', and the ''Bug Bible''. The novel's title refers to the character of Nathan Price, a missionary in the 1950s [[Belgian Congo]] who creates his own "misprint" by mispronouncing the local expression "Tata Jesus is bängala", meaning "Jesus is most precious". In his pronunciation, he actually says "Jesus is [[poisonwood]]!"
* In the novel ''[[The Hundred-Year-Old Man Who Climbed Out the Window and Disappeared]]'', a Bible erratum plays heavily into the plot. The Bibles in question carry an extra verse (Revelation 22:22), reading "And they all lived happily ever after".
* In the ''[[Family Guy]]'' episode "[[Holy Crap]]", two cardinals discuss a fictional error in the bible. One cardinal remarks to another, "Hey, did you ever notice this? On page 375, it says 'Jebus'." The other cardinal replies, "It's supposed to say Jesus, right?"
* In the ''[[American Dad!]]'' episode [[The One That Got Away (American Dad!)|"The One That Got Away"]], Roger sabotages an alter ego character of himself who is a Bible salesman by sneaking an edit into a new print run of Bibles. The boss is not happy when Genesis starts "In the beginning God created the Heavens and a transvestite who pooped mozzarella dinosaurs."

'''Canada's first response''' to the disaster inflicted by [[Hurricane Katrina]] along the [[Gulf of Mexico]] coastline of the [[United States]] was the deployment of a [[Vancouver]] heavy urban search and rescue team, which arrived in [[Lafayette, Louisiana]] on the evening of August 31, 2005, arriving on a [[WestJet Airlines]] aircraft. Due to security and logistics issues in the disaster area surrounding New Orleans, the team started operations on September 3, saving 30 people that day.  They returned to Vancouver on September 6, reportedly saving over 110 people during their deployment. It has also accepted some evacuees to stay in [[Canada]].

==Official Canadian government response==

The official response by the Government of Canada to the Gulf coast disaster came on September 2, following discussions between [[Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness Canada]] and the U.S. [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]].  The federal government announced it was deploying a task force comprising three [[Canadian Forces Maritime Command|warships]]&amp;mdash;{{HMCS|Athabaskan|DDG 282|6}}, {{HMCS|Toronto|FFH 333|6}} and {{HMCS|Ville de Québec|FFH 332|6}}&amp;mdash;along with the [[Canadian Coast Guard|Coast Guard]] vessel {{ship|CCGS|Sir William Alexander}} and three [[Sikorsky CH-124 Sea King|Sea King helicopters]] and one [[Eurocopter BO 105|BO-105 helicopter]] to the area.

The Canadian Forces also provided several [[CH-146 Griffon|Griffon helicopters]] and crews to the [[New England]] States at the request of the [[United States Coast Guard]] whose search and rescue helicopters from that area have been assigned to Gulf Coast SAR operations. Canadian aircraft were deployed as part of a [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA) military assistance pact.

[[File:RCMP and US Infantry outside Canadian Embassy.jpg|thumb|left|U.S. infantry led by the RCMP outside the Canadian Embassy on September 7 to raise funds for Katrina victims.]]

The task force was organized under the name "Operation UNISON" and involved over 1,000 personnel from the Canadian Forces and Canadian Coast Guard who were placed under the operational command of their American counterparts who were coordinating relief operations. A precedent was established with a similar humanitarian aid response by the Government of Canada following [[Hurricane Andrew]] when the Auxiliary Oil Replenishment (AOR) ship {{HMCS|Protecteur|AOR 509|6}} participated in "Operation TEMPEST", providing relief supplies and personnel in southern Florida and the Bahamas.

The ships and aircraft had the capacity to relocate people and deliver a broad range of supplies, including tents, cots, water containers and items such as men's and women's toiletries, sun screen and insect repellent.  At the same time, the [[Public Health Agency of Canada]] was in contact with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and offered whatever support was required. "We are really prepared to operate on all fronts as requested and as co-ordinated by the United States," said Prime Minister [[Paul Martin]].

In an interview on [[National Public Radio]], Canada's Ambassador to the United States said that in addition to the basic desire to help a neighbor in need, many Canadians also remember the ancestors of Louisiana's Cajuns were [[Great Expulsion|expelled]] from what would become Canada by the British in the 18th century, which he felt gave an extra historical dimension to Canadians' desire to help the people of Louisiana during the recovery operation.

On September 4, following a request from U.S. [[Department of Health and Human Services]], the Government of Canada announced it was prepared to send thousands of beds, blankets, surgical gloves and dressings and other medical supplies. The Government of Canada announced it would also send 35 divers to help with the rescue effort. One of the divers' tasks would be to inspect levees.

[[File:Canadian relief transport.jpg|thumb|[[United States Navy]] personnel unload Canadian relief supplies from a [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] transport aircraft in [[Pensacola, Florida]].]]

On September 5, a team of 35 military divers was deployed from [[CFB Halifax]] and [[CFB Esquimalt]] to Pensacola, Florida. They were tasked with assisting their U.S. Navy counterparts to clear navigational hazards, including unsecured and sunken vessels and debris, and to inspect flood-damaged levees.

On September 6 the Operation UNISON task force of navy and coast guard ships departed [[Halifax Harbour]] for the U.S. Gulf Coast.  The naval ships arrived at Pensacola, Florida several days later, having been delayed by further tropical storm activity off the east coast of Florida.  The coast guard ship arrived several days later, due to its slower cruising speed.  The Operation UNISON task force unloaded relief supplies at Pensacola and was deployed to assist along the Mississippi coast.

On September 19 it was announced that the three warships from the Operation UNISON task force would be returning to Halifax, leaving CCGS ''Sir William Alexander'' to continue its mission of clearing navigation hazards and repairing buoys.  On September 28, the coast guard vessel was retasked to assist the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] in repairing the network of weather buoys along the Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic coasts of the United States, which had been severely damaged by the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season; these buoys are one of the most important tools for forecasting and gathering data from oceanic storms. CCGS ''Sir William Alexander'' returned to Canada on October 24.

* The [[Canadian Red Cross]]  launched an immediate nationwide appeal for donations to enable the organization to provide aid to its American counterpart.  37 [[Canadian Red Cross]] personnel were transported by Canadian military aircraft to assist with efforts in [[Houston, Texas]]; they were followed by dozens of other Red Cross personnel once the situation assessment was completed.  The American Red Cross asked Canadian Red Cross chapters in Quebec for cots for refugees staying at U.S. evacuation centres and other services were requested from chapters in Ontario.
* The Government of [[Nova Scotia]] donated $100,000 towards the Red Cross effort.  This was followed on September 8 when the Government of [[Alberta]] announced that it was donating $5 million to the Hurricane Katrina fund administered by former presidents [[George H. W. Bush|Bush]] and [[Bill Clinton|Clinton]].  The cheque was personally given by Premier [[Ralph Klein]] to former president Clinton during a visit to Alberta in October.
* Other provinces expressed interest in providing temporary housing to those left homeless.  Some residents of [[Nova Scotia]], [[New Brunswick]] and [[Prince Edward Island]] offered shelter to the homeless survivors of hurricane Katrina.  [[Anne McLellan]], the [[Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness]], announced that her department was discussing with the U.S. National Security Advisor the possibility of Canadians billeting American storm evacuees. Big cities like [[Calgary]], [[Ottawa]], [[Vancouver]], [[Toronto]], and [[Montreal]] accepted 1,200 evacuees in all .
* Universities across Canada offered to take in university students from New Orleans whose studies have been interrupted.  Some institutions went so far as to offer full tuition scholarships and free room and board.
* [[Hydro-Electric Power Commission of Ontario|Ontario Hydro]], [[Hydro-Québec]], and [[Manitoba Hydro]], along with other electrical utilities, sent repair crews to assist in restoring electrical power service.
* Canada increased oil exports as requested by the [[International Energy Agency|IEA]] to help stabilize the world market in the wake of the crisis and its impact on North American oil production and refining capacity.
* On September 2 [[Air Canada]] participated along with U.S. member airlines of the Air Transport Association, in a voluntary airline industry initiative to support rescue and relief operations. Air Canada was the first foreign carrier to land in New Orleans delivering water and supplies and lifting victims to safety.
* On September 7, the Canadian Embassy started a Hurricane Katrina fund to support victims in the Gulf region.  [[Frank McKenna]], Canadian ambassador to the United States, told Americans "you are our friends and together we are family &amp;ndash; you do not suffer alone."

'''Casa del Alabado''' is a Precolumbian Art Museum located in the historic downtown area of [[Quito, Ecuador]]. The museum is located in a colonial house built in the 17th century during the Spanish Colony. It houses a collection of over 5,000 archaeological pieces, 500 of which are on permanent display.

Casa del Alabado is unique in the sense that its display is organized thematically, not chronologically. The aim of the museum is to treat objects as works of art rather than archaeological remnants. 
The display is distributed along 8 rooms with 8 different themes, which serve as representations of cultural aspects of ancient Ecuadorian cultures: their cosmology, their relationship with their ancestors, their religious ideas and rituals, and their relationship with their environment. 

The museum has:

8 exhibit rooms, 1 room for temporary exhibits, 2 rooms for workshops, a museum shop and 2 courtyards.

'''Opening Hours'''

Open from Monday to Sunday, from 9:00am to 5:30pm.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1506">The '''[[Tumulus|tumuli]] of Cekeen''' are located in the [[Diourbel Department]] of the [[Diourbel Region]]. The Diourbel Region and the city of [[Diourbel]] were part of the precolonial [[Kingdom of Baol]], now part of present-day [[Senegal]]. 

==Purpose==
In this area, a tumulus was used as a burial mound for chiefs.  A deceased chief would be joined by other members of his court along with important objects such as furniture and other implements.&lt;ref name="whc.unesco.org"&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/2079/ Les tumulus de Cekeen - UNESCO World Heritage Centre]&lt;/ref&gt;  In this case, he and his escort would be situated in the chief's hut, whereupon the hut was buried with soil and rocks. Thousands of such tumuli exist in Senegal, but it is in Cekeen that the biggest and most densely scattered occur.

== World Heritage Status ==

This site was added to the [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage]] Tentative List on November 18, 2005 in the Cultural category.&lt;ref name="whc.unesco.org" /&gt;

'''Cennino &lt;!--NOTE--&gt;d&lt;!--The "d" remains lower-case except when at the start of a sentence ie. "D'Andrea is daring."--&gt;'Andrea Cennini''' (c. 1360 &amp;ndash; before 1427) was an [[Italy|Italian]] [[Painting|painter]] influenced by [[Giotto di Bondone|Giotto]]. He was a student of [[Agnolo Gaddi]] in [[Florence]]. Gaddi trained under his father, called Taddeo Gaddi, who trained with Giotto. 

Cennini was born in [[Colle di Val d'Elsa]], [[Tuscany]]. After training as an artist with Agnolo Gaddi in Florence he worked at the court of [[Francesco Novello da Carrara]] in Padua for some years before apparently returning to Colle di Val d'Elsa.

He is remembered mainly for having authored '''''Il libro dell'arte'''''. Thought to have been written around the turn of the 15th century, the book is a "how to" on late Medieval and early Renaissance painting. It contains information on [[pigment]]s, [[brush]]es, drawing, [[panel painting]], the art of [[fresco]], painting on fabrics and casting, amongst other techniques and tricks. Cennini also mentions oil painting in passing, which was important for dispelling the myth, propagated by [[Giorgio Vasari]] and [[Karel Van Mander]], that [[oil painting]] was invented by [[Jan van Eyck]] (although [[Theophilus Presbyter|Theophilus]] (Roger of Helmerhausen) clearly gives instructions for oil-based painting in his treatise, On Divers Arts, written in 1125).

The dates of Cennini's life are highly speculative. It is often falsely assumed that he was alive in 1437 because that date appears on the earliest of the four extant copies of his manuscript. However, an administrative document from Colle di Val d'Elsa dated 1427 probably refers to his son; if this is the case then the document makes it clear that Cennini was dead by this time. The techniques Cennini describes range from ones which were already in use in the 13th century to ones which were innovative in the late fourteenth century. However, there is no evidence in his writing of the exciting developments in oil painting taking place in the early 15th century, suggesting that his book was written not long after the turn of the century.

The extent to which Cennini intended to provide a practical handbook for the apprentice painter is disputed. Some scholars believe that his book was a presentation book or a guild book instead. Along with technical methods, Cennini offered advice on the sort of lifestyle to which a young painter should subscribe. "Your life should be arranged just as if you were studying [[theology]], or [[philosophy]], or other theories, that is to say, eating and drinking moderately, at least twice a day, electing digestible and wholesome dishes, and light wines; saving and sparing your hand, preserving it from such strains as heaving stones, crowbars, and many other things which are bad for your hand, from giving them a chance to weary it. There is another cause which, if you indulge it, can make your hand so unsteady that it will waver more, and flutter far more, than leaves do in the wind, and this is indulging too much in the company of women."

According to [[Victoria Finlay]], in her book ''Colour: Travels Through The Paintbox, the infamous UK forger'', [[Eric Hebborn]] was greatly influenced by Cennino Cennini. The last book Hebborn wrote before he was brutally murdered was ''The Art Forger's Handbook''. Finlay writes that he "used and adapted Cennino's advice extensively - preparing panels, tinting papers different colours, and making brand new works look as if they had been varnished some time before (by beating egg-white, left overnight and then applying it with a brush), just as the master advised."

In the 1970s, Boskovits established a small oeuvre for Cennini, which has been confirmed by later scholarship. This includes frescoes in the church of San Lucchese in Poggibonsi and a panel painting depicting the birth of the Virgin in the Museo Comunale in Colle di Val d'Elsa. The two paintings pictured above were added to the corpus at a later date.

The '''Chemtou Museum''' is an [[archaeological museum]] located in [[Chemtou]], [[Tunisia]]. The [[museum]] was designed by archaeologists with the [[Tunisian National Heritage Institute]] and the [[German Archaeological Institute]] with offices located in [[Rome]], [[Italy]]. It has the distinction of being located in the area of the old [[Roman Empire|Roman]] city of Simmithu, near the entrepot's [[marble]] quarry in what was the ancient [[Berbers|Berber]] kingdom of [[Numidia]].

==Marble quarries==
[[File:Funerary steles in Archaeological Museum of Chemtou.jpg|thumb|Funerary [[stele|stelae]] at the Chemtou Museum]]
The exploitation of [[marble]] began on site in the 2nd century and was operated by the [[Roman emperor]]s. The location of the area, not far from the [[Medjerda River]], allowed for mass production for export.

The museum presents the archaeological discoveries made nearby. Among the remains exposed, include sandstone green schist (dated from the 3rd century BC). A [[tiara]] has also been excavated, which belonged to the Numidian royal family. In addition, there is the restored [[facade|façade]] of a religious monument on a hill nearby.

A series of Roman mill races to horizontal [[water turbine]]s have also been discovered. This indicates that [[Roman technology|technologically]], part of the activities at the site had been mechanised.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11501">[[File:Mound 1.JPG|thumb|right|300px|Mound 1, Chiapa de Corzo, looking south toward the Grijalva River.]]

'''Chiapa de Corzo'''  (&lt;small&gt;Spanish&lt;/small&gt; {{Audio-IPA|Chiapa de Corzo.ogg|}})  is an [[archaeological site]] of [[pre-Columbian]] [[Mesoamerica]] located near the small town [[Chiapa de Corzo, Chiapas]].

It rose to prominence around 700-500 BC, during the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Middle Formative]] period, becoming a regional center. By then, its public precinct had reached 18-20 ha in size, with total settlement approaching 70 ha. Because of its position near [[Grijalva River]] in the Central Depression of Chiapas, it controlled the local trade routes.&lt;ref&gt;Pool, p. 272.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The modern township of [[Chiapa de Corzo, Chiapas]], founded in Colonial times and after which the site was named, is nearby.

==Site history==
[[File:SE Mesoamerican Formative Period sites.svg|thumb|left|Chiapa de Corzo and other Formative Period sites, approximately 900 BCE.]]

The site shows evidence of continual occupation since the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Early Formative period]] ([[circa|ca.]] 1200 [[Common Era|BCE]]).

The mounds and plazas at the site, however, date to approximately 700 BCE with temples and palaces constructed at the end of the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Late Formative]] or Protoclassic period, between 100 BCE and 200 CE.&lt;ref&gt;Lowe, p. 122-123.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lowe 1962&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, archaeologists discovered a massive Middle Formative [[Olmec]] axe deposit at the base of Chiapa de Corzo's Mound 11 pyramid. This deposit dates to around 700 BCE and is the second one of its kind found in Chiapas after nearby [[San Isidro (Chiapas)|San Isidro]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}  It is associated with one of the earliest [[E-Group]] astronomical complexes in Mesoamerica.

In April 2010, archaeologists discovered the 2,700-year-old tomb of a dignitary within Mound 11 that is the oldest pyramidal tomb yet discovered in Mesoamerica.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/18/science/18tomb.html In an Ancient Mexican Tomb, High Society] New York Times, 17 May 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/2010/may/25/science/la-sci-earliest-tomb-20100523 One of Mesoamerica's Oldest Tombs Found] Los Angeles Times, 25 May 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.sltrib.com/article.php?id=9337063&amp;itype=storyID&amp;keyword=&amp;qtype= BYU-led Team Finds Treasure-filled Tomb in Chiapas] Salt Lake Tribune, 21 May 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2010/05/100518-oldest-pyramid-tomb-zoque-mexico-science/ Pyramid Tomb Found: Sign of a Civilization's Birth?] National Geographic Society, 18 May 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

According to archaeologist Bruce Bachand, the tomb exhibits Olmec rather than Maya affinities. This tomb predates by 600 years any other such tomb found in Mesoamerica, such as those at [[Tikal]], and at [[Kaminaljuyu]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://popular-archaeology.com/issue/fall-2015/article/discovery-of-one-of-mesoamericas-oldest-known-ancient-pyramidal-tombs Discovery of one of Mesoamerica’s oldest known ancient pyramidal tombs] Popular Archaeology &lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural affiliation==
The site is believed to have been settled by [[Mixe–Zoque languages|Mixe–Zoquean]] speakers, bearers of the [[Olmec]] culture that populated the Gulf and Pacific Coasts of southern Mexico.

Chiapa de Corzo and a half dozen other western Depression centers appear to have coalesced into a distinct [[Zoque people|Zoque]] civilization by 700 BCE, an archaeological culture that became the conduit between late Gulf Olmec society and the early [[Maya civilization|Maya]].&lt;ref&gt;Clark 2000&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lowe 1977&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lowe 1999&lt;/ref&gt; Certain Mesoamerican traits such as planned cities, earthen pyramids, [[E-Group]] commemorative complexes, cloudy-resist waxy pottery, incensarios, and early logographic writing may have originated in the [[Zoque people|Zoque]] region.

==Regional centre==
Starting around 100 BCE, during its ''Guanacaste phase'', Chiapa de Corzo played the role of the regional capital. The city was linked with other areas across the Maya Lowlands, Maya Highlands, Pacific Coast, and Oaxaca. This is the time when the first hieroglyphic writing appeared on flat stamps, pottery vessels, stelae, and building panels.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chiapadecorzo.byu.edu/ The Chiapa de Corzo Project] chiapadecorzo.byu.edu&lt;/ref&gt;

Maya pottery types began to be included in elite burials, although utilitarian ceramics retained traditional patterns.&lt;ref&gt;Pool, p. 272.&lt;/ref&gt;  This has suggested to some researchers, that the Maya culture to the east exerted influence or even control over Chiapa de Corzo, although there seems to be a waning of that Maya influence in the first centuries [[Common era|CE]].&lt;ref&gt;See discussion in Pool, p. 272.&lt;/ref&gt;  It was during this time that the ancient platform mounds were covered with limestone and stucco.

==Decline==
Big changes occurred in the area during the ''Istmo phase'' (AD 300-400).  There was an economic decline, as craft activity diminished and long-distance ties contracted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chiapadecorzo.byu.edu/ The Chiapa de Corzo Project] chiapadecorzo.byu.edu&lt;/ref&gt;

Chiapa de Corzo and a number of western Depression sites were abandoned by the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Late Classic]] period, a population change that closely coincides with the invasion of a war like group of [[Manguean]]-speaking people known as the [[Chiapanec]].&lt;ref&gt;Lowe 2000, p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Navarrete 1966.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Warren, pp. 139-144.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chiapanec chose to occupy the adjacent floodplain of the Grijalva River where the modern town is now located, and they left the Zoque ruin on the nearby plateau untouched. The abandoned city now became a place of pilgrimage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chiapadecorzo.byu.edu/ The Chiapa de Corzo Project] chiapadecorzo.byu.edu&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern developments==
The site has been heavily encroached upon over the last 70 years with the construction of roads, homes, businesses, utility systems, and a cemetery. The Nestlé company constructed a large milk processing plant in the center of the ruin in the late 1960s, removing Mound 17, one of the major ceremonial mounds at the site. In recent years, the Instituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia ([[INAH]]) has purchased sections of the site from local land owners. INAH officially opened a small portion of the ruin to tourists on December 8, 2009. The site is currently under investigation by a collaborative team of researchers from Brigham Young University, INAH-Chiapas, and Mexico's UNAM (see http://chiapadecorzo.byu.edu/).

==Notable finds==
[[File:Ceramic vessels from Chiapa de Corzo.png|thumb|right|pottery from the site]]
[[File:Stela2,Chiapa de Corzo.JPG|thumb|right|Stela 2, showing the date of 7.16.3.2.13, or December 36 BCE, the earliest [[Mesoamerican Long Count calendar]] date yet found.]]
[[File:SkeletonChiapaRegMusTuxtla.JPG|thumb|Skeleton from Mound 5 on display at the [[Regional Museum of Anthropology and History of Chiapas]].]]
The oldest [[Mesoamerican Long Count calendar]] date yet discovered, December 36 BCE, was found on Stela 2 (which is not a [[stela]] at all, but rather a misnamed, inscribed wall panel).  All that survives of the original text is the day-name and the digits 7.16.3.2.13.  

Chiapa de Corzo is also notable for a pottery sherd containing what is likely [[Epi-Olmec script]].  Dated to as early as 300 BCE, this sherd would be the oldest instance of that [[Mesoamerican writing systems|writing system]] yet discovered.&lt;ref&gt;Justeson, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

The site possesses possibly the earliest example of a Mesoamerican palace complex in Mound 5.&lt;ref&gt;see Lowe 1962&lt;/ref&gt; This palace was constructed in the first century CE and ritually destroyed a couple centuries later.

More than 250 Formative period burials have been scientifically excavated at Chiapa de Corzo. Many derive from a unique Late Formative burial ground below the Mound 1 plaza. Chiapa de Corzo has the largest and perhaps the best chronologically subdivided Formative period burial sample in southern Mesoamerica. 

Chiapa de Corzo has more clay cylinder seals and flat stamps than any other Formative Mesoamerican site, save [[Tlatilco]].&lt;ref&gt;see Lee 1969&lt;/ref&gt; Hieroglyphs appear on examples made around 100 BCE.

'''Cliff inscriptions''' ({{zh|s=摩崖石刻|t=摩崖石刻|p=mó yá shíkè|l=rub cliff stone-inscription}}) are inscriptions on mountainsides of Chinese characters, often done by famous people on special occasions or as decorations. They are of tremendous historic importance as both evidence of the presence of certain people, such as famous writers, or events as well as of the Chinese script's regional, temporal, or personal variations. Being in stone they are less prone to destruction than paper and so preserve the time in which they were made offering posterity unique glimpses into the past. Additionally, along with [[Chinese calligraphy]], they are an art form meriting study and part of a highly specialized field within art which requires both skills in calligraphy and [[stone carving]]. The methods are likely similar to calligraphy stele or 碑 ''bēi'', such as can be found in Xi'an's [[Stele Forest]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2624">'''Cognitive hearing science''' is an [[interdisciplinary]] science field concerned with the physiological and cognitive basis of hearing and its interplay with [[signal processing]] in [[hearing aid]]s. The field includes [[genetics]], [[physiology]], medical and technical [[audiology]], cognitive [[neuroscience]], [[cognitive psychology]], [[linguistics]] and [[social psychology]].

Theoretically the research in cognitive hearing science combines a physiological model for the information transfer from the outer [[Ear|auditory]] organ to the auditory [[cerebral cortex]], and a cognitive model for how [[language comprehension]] is influenced by the interplay between the incoming language signal and the individual's [[cognition|cognitive]] skills, especially the [[long-term memory]] and the [[working memory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Project database |  url=http://vrproj.vr.se/detail.asp?arendeid=57495 | publisher=[[Swedish Research Council]] | accessdate=2010-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers examine the interplay between type of [[hearing impairment]] or [[deafness]], type of signal processing in different [[hearing aid]]s, type of listening environment and the individual's cognitive skills.

Research in cognitive hearing science has importance for the knowledge about different types of hearing impairment and its effects, as for the possibilities to determine which individuals can make use of certain type of signal processing in hearing aid or [[cochlear implant]] and thereby adapt hearing aid to the individual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=About Linnaeus Centre Head p. 3-4 |  url=http://www.ibl.liu.se/cdd/ihv/högerspalt-startsida-ihv/1.189512/broschyrHEADLinncentrum.pdf | publisher=[[Linköping University]] | accessdate=2010-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cognitive hearing science has been introduced by researchers at the [[Linköping University]] research centre Linnaeus Centre HEAD (HEaring And Deafness) in Sweden, created in 2008 with a major 10-year grant from the Swedish Research Council.

'''"Daybreak"''' is the three-part series finale of the reimagined [[science fiction]] [[television series]] ''[[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)|Battlestar Galactica]]'', and are the 74th (labeled "'''Daybreak, Part 1"''' on the DVD) and 75th (labeled "'''Daybreak, Parts 2 &amp; 3"''' on the DVD) episodes overall. The episodes aired on the U.S. [[Syfy|Sci Fi Channel]] and [[Space (Canadian TV channel)|SPACE]] in Canada respectively on March 13 and March 20, 2009. The second part ("'''Daybreak, Parts 2 &amp; 3"''') is double-length. The episodes were written by [[Ronald D. Moore]], and directed by [[Michael Rymer]]. The Season 4.5 DVD and Blu-ray releases for Region 1 feature an extended version of the finale, which not only combines all three parts as a single episode, but also integrates it with new scenes not seen in the aired version of either part. The survivor count shown in the title sequence for Part 1 is 39,516. The survivor count shown in the title sequence for Part 2 is 39,406. At the end of Part 2, Admiral Adama announces the survivor population at approximately 38,000.

The episodes portray the ''Galactica'' launching a rescue mission to retrieve [[Hera Agathon]] from the "colony", a heavily armed and defended Cylon base located near a [[black hole]]. They manage to rescue Hera, and in the end, the fleet finds a new planet to settle on, which they come to call Earth (revealed to be our [[Earth]]). The final episodes gave ''Battlestar Galactica'' the strongest ratings since its second season, though they received mixed reviews.

==Plot==
===Part 1===
[[File:DaybreakPart1.jpg|thumbnail|right|The Galactica crew members and civilians divide themselves between those joining the rescue attempt, and those staying behind with the fleet.]] The flashback sequences during the course of the first part take place a few years before the Cylon attack on Caprica. [[William Adama]] ([[Edward James Olmos]]) is reluctant to undergo a lie detector test in preparation for a civilian desk job. Elsewhere, [[Gaius Baltar]] ([[James Callis]]) is getting tired of his father, Julius, who is abusive to his nurse. However, [[Number Six (Battlestar Galactica)|Caprica Six]] ([[Tricia Helfer]]) soon informs Baltar that she took his father into a care home, where he will be happier. [[Laura Roslin]] ([[Mary McDonnell]]) is living happily with her two sisters, one of whom is pregnant. But later, Roslin receives distressing news that both her sisters and father were killed in a car accident. Three months after, she is set up for a blind date and is encouraged to join [[Richard Adar|Mayor Adar's]] presidential campaign. [[Lee Adama]] ([[Jamie Bamber]]) meets [[Kara Thrace]] ([[Katee Sackhoff]]) for the first time while she is seeing his brother, [[Zak Adama|Zak]] ([[Tobias Mehler]]). When Lee arrives home drunk, he notices a [[pigeon]] in his house, and he chases it away. Lastly, the flashbacks focus on [[Samuel Anders|Anders]] ([[Michael Trucco]]), who is interviewed during his sporting career, where he admits to playing for the joy of the pursuit of perfection rather than the winning.

Back in the present, ''[[Battlestar Galactica (ship)#Battlestar Galactica (2003)|Galactica]]'' is being stripped for parts to be used on other ships, while the military will be transferred to control the Rebel [[Basestar]]. The pictures of the fallen in the memorial hallway are also taken down. Baltar wants his people to have a seat on the quorum, but Lee refuses. Admiral Adama later decides to give [[amnesty]] to those who took part in the attempted [[coup d'état]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=Blood on the Scales |episodelink=Blood on the Scales |series=Battlestar Galactica |serieslink=Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series) |credits=[[Wayne Rose]] (director); [[Michael Angeli]] (writer) |network=[[Sci Fi Channel (United States)|Sci Fi Channel]] |season=4 |number=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as to [[Galen Tyrol|Tyrol]] ([[Aaron Douglas (actor)|Aaron Douglas]]), who is in the brig for helping [[Sharon Valerii|Boomer]] ([[Grace Park (actress)|Grace Park]]) escape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=Someone to Watch Over Me |episodelink=Someone to Watch Over Me (Battlestar Galactica) |series=Battlestar Galactica |serieslink=Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series) |credits=[[Michael Nankin]] (director); [[Bradley Thompson]] &amp; [[David Weddle]] (writers) |network=[[Sci Fi Channel (United States)|Sci Fi Channel]] |season=4 |number=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; This allows Tyrol to take part in the mission to retrieve [[Hera Agathon|Hera]] (Iliana Gomez-Martinez), who is being studied by the [[Cylon (reimagining)|Cylons]] to determine how Cylons can reproduce. Adama announces a plan to rescue the child Hera at the colony and that it will be a one-way trip for the Galactica, and requires all Galactica personnel to either volunteer for the mission or decline in person.  He and Starbuck lay a line down the center of the landing bay and personnel move to one side to volunteer or the other to remain with the Fleet.  [[Sherman Cottle|Doc Cottle]] ([[Donnelly Rhodes]]) attempts to join in, but is ordered back by Adama as the fleet cannot afford to lose a doctor. Several others join in the operation, including the original Cylon models, and a weakened Roslin. A Raptor is dispatched to the possible location of the "Colony", only to find it located very close to a [[black hole]], but despite the circumstance, Adama orders an attack to begin and planning commences.

===Part 2===
In flashback sequences, William Adama and [[Saul Tigh]] ([[Michael Hogan (Canadian actor)|Michael Hogan]]) celebrate their upcoming retirement, where Tigh convinces Adama to take his new job. Later, as  Adama is questioned in an interview, he complains that no job is worth questioning his loyalty and decides to rejoin the military. Lee has dinner with Zak and [[Kara Thrace|Starbuck]] again. When Zak passes out, drunk, the sexual tension between Kara and Lee nearly erupts before they are interrupted by a stirring Zak. Back home, Lee again encounters the pigeon, but this time he does not chase it. Roslin meets her blind date, who happens to be a former student of hers. After they go back to her apartment, she has second thoughts and ends the date; she then calls Adar's campaign, informing them of her intention to join it. Boomer meets Adama and Tigh for the first time, where she is warned that she is on the verge of ending her career due to her inability to land a Raptor. Given one last chance, Boomer gratefully tells the two that unlike other pilots, she will repay Adama one day. Meanwhile, Baltar, believing that Caprica Six is a corporate spy, allows her access to the military defense mainframe. He says that he is not doing this for her employers, but for her.

Back in the present of the series, Baltar decides to join the mission with Caprica Six at the last minute; she later admits to being proud of him for the first time. At that moment it is revealed that Baltar's Inner Six and Six's Inner Baltar are aware of each other, and the two real-life counterparts see both of them. [[Romo Lampkin]] ([[Mark Sheppard]]) is installed as president, and Hoshi (Brad Dryborough) is given command of the fleet while Adama and ''Galactica'' set off to rescue Hera. A battalion of the self-aware Cylon Centurions who are aligned with the fleet march down the flight deck  - red stripes painted diagonally on their chests to distinguish them from the others.

''Galactica'' jumps right next to the colony, where they are immediately fired upon. Some of the Raptors, which are armed with [[nuclear weapon]]s, make a short jump into the debris field and fly toward the back of the colony; in the process, [[Margaret Edmondson|Racetrack]] ([[Leah Cairns]]) and Skulls (Collin Lawrence) are killed by an asteroid. Anders has been installed into the CIC computers, and disables the Colony hybrids (Tiffany Lyndall-Knight). Starbuck's Raptor, carrying Athena and Helo, lands on the Colony - the only Raptor to make it through - and they enter to search for Hera. ''Galactica'' rams straight into the colony, where a strike team led by Apollo rappels in from ''Galactica'' to search for Hera, eventually meeting with Starbuck's squad. Hera is rescued by Boomer, who kills [[Number Four (Battlestar Galactica)|Simon]] ([[Rick Worthy]]) and finds Starbuck's team. Boomer hands Hera over to [[Sharon Agathon|Athena]] ([[Grace Park (actress)|Grace Park]]) and tells her to "tell the old man I owed him one."  After her daughter is returned, Athena kills Boomer.

''Galactica'' is set upon by Cylon boarding parties arriving in "platoon strength", as reported to Tigh and Adama in the CIC. As Starbuck, Apollo, Athena and Helo return to the battlestar and make their way to CIC, they encounter a boarding party composed of Cavil's modern Centurions and original Cylon War models.  Hera runs away in the confusion. She is spotted by Roslin, who had a vision of her while assisting with [[triage]], and is able to hide her from the Cylons, until she disappears again. While Roslin gives chase, Baltar and Caprica Six also spot Hera and give chase as well. The chase parallels the Opera House vision shared between Athena, Roslin and Caprica Six.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=Crossroads |episodelink=Crossroads (Battlestar Galactica) |series=Battlestar Galactica |serieslink=Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series) |credits=[[Michael Rymer]] (director); [[Michael Taylor (screenwriter)|Michael Taylor]] (writer) |network=[[Sci Fi Channel (United States)|Sci Fi Channel]] |season=3 |number=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The chase ends in the CIC, where [[John Cavil|Cavil]] ([[Dean Stockwell]]) takes her hostage and demands to leave with Hera so she can be dissected and establish a method for Cylons to reproduce. Inner Six and Inner Baltar again appear jointly to Baltar, inspiring him to make the speech his entire life has led to, saying, among other things, that he sees angels,&lt;ref name="The Final David Eick video blogs"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.scifi.com/battlestar/?clip=10| title=Do You Believe in Angels? | publisher=Scifi.com | accessdate=2009-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that a divine force ("whether God or Gods") has entwined the destinies of both sides. Tigh provides the final incentive, saying that the Final Five will give the Cylons back resurrection (a solution to the problem of Cylon extinction) if they vow to forever go separate ways from humanity and end their pursuit.  Combined, this convinces Cavil and Adama to end the war, Cavil gives Hera back and will let them leave in peace when the Final Five give the technology for resurrection.

===Part 3===

Cavil calls a cease fire in preparation for the data download and the boarding parties retreat.  Roslin and Adama look on as the Final Five begin the download of the technology for resurrection, with Saul and [[Ellen Tigh]] ([[Kate Vernon]]), [[Tory Foster]] ([[Rekha Sharma]]) and [[Galen Tyrol]] ([[Aaron Douglas (actor)|Aaron Douglas]]) dipping their hands into [[Samuel Anders]]' ([[Michael Trucco]]) tank to transfer the data to the Colony. Ellen warns that during the download they will briefly have full knowledge of each other's memories and experiences.  Tory asks that all bygones be left bygones.  The download commences and the Final Five experience flashbacks to each other's lives on Earth and in the colonies.  Tyrol learns then that Tory murdered his wife, [[Cally Tyrol|Cally]], and kills her in revenge before the downloading is complete. Feeling betrayed, the Cylons resume fighting; after the other Cylons in CIC are killed, Cavil commits [[suicide]]. At the same instant, a chance rock strike in the debris field causes Racetrack's dead hand to fall on the launch button for her Raptor's nuclear weapons, which were primed for launch before the Raptor's crew was lost.  The missiles strike directly into the Colony, knocking it out of orbit.  With ''Galactica'' still tangled in the Colony and being dragged toward the singularity along with it, Adama orders Starbuck to jump the ship away, anywhere. In a flash of inspiration, Starbuck mutters "[[All Along the Watchtower|there must be some kind of way out of here]]" and enters coordinates into the computer as if she were playing the [[All Along the Watchtower|mysterious music notes]] which Hera had written. ''Galactica'' jumps away and out of danger, leaving the Colony to fall to its destruction within the black hole.&lt;ref name="podcast"&gt;{{cite podcast|url=http://media.scifi.com/battlestar/downloads/podcast/mp3/421-423/bsg_ep421-423_FULL.mp3 |title=Podcast for "Daybreak" (56.3 MB) |website=[scifi.com] |publisher=[[Scifi.com]] |host=Ronald D Moore |accessdate=April 27, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090324221120/http://media.scifi.com/battlestar/downloads/podcast/mp3/421-423/bsg_ep421-423_FULL.mp3 |archivedate=March 24, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The war is over, and the Humans and their allies have prevailed.

''Galactica'' arrives at Kara's mysterious coordinates, its final destination as the damage caused in the battle has rendered the ship incapable of surviving any further jumps. Miraculously, the ''Galactica'' finds itself in orbit around a moon, close to a habitable world: our own [[Earth]].

Hours later, the rest of the fleet joins Galactica at this new world.  Lee makes the unorthodox suggestion that they abandon their technology and start afresh, while Adama and others discover primitive humans already occupying the planet. Since finding Earth had always been the goal of the Colonial Fleet, Adama suggests they call this new planet "Earth". The survivors - ''Galactica's'' crew, the remaining inhabitants of the fleet, and the Cylon Twos, Sixes and Eights - take basic supplies and spread out across the planet - not to colonize and impose cities like the [[Twelve Colonies]], but to blend in with primitive early humans, adding their own human and humanoid Cylon "genetics" to the early humans. Anders takes control of their abandoned fleet and pilots it into the Sun, so that the new arrivals "can give them the best part of ourselves... not the baggage... not the weapons... our hearts (rather than) our science". The Rebel Cylons decide that their Centurions have earned their freedom, and give them control of the Basestar, which jumps away to parts unknown.  Baltar and Caprica Six are visited by their [[Number Six (Battlestar Galactica)#Head/Inner/Messenger Six|Inner messengers]], who inform them that their destinies - to save Hera - have been fulfilled, and the two decide to live out the rest of their lives together.

While resting under a tree, Roslin suddenly begins to have difficulty breathing.  Adama quickly places her aboard a Raptor and says a short, final goodbye to Lee and Starbuck before taking off. While admiring the wildlife below and looking for a place to build a cabin for them, Roslin dies peacefully.  While Lee expresses his desire to venture off and explore the planet, Starbuck, her destiny as an Angel fulfilled, literally vanishes without a trace.  Lee promises to never forget her.  Tyrol decides to settle by himself on a remote northern island (implied to be the Scottish highlands). Helo ([[Tahmoh Penikett]]), Athena and Hera are reunited as a family. Tigh and Ellen stay with the rest of the survivors. Adama eventually finds the place where he will build the cabin, and buries Laura on a nearby hillside.

===Epilogue===
[[New York City]], 150,000 years later: humanity has reached the early 21st century, and the development of robotics and computerization continues unabated.  Inner Baltar and Inner Six (no longer tied to the long-deceased Gaius Baltar and Caprica Six)&lt;ref&gt;This is consistent with [[Ronald D. Moore]]'s statement in [http://video.scifi.com/player/?id=1063661#videoid=1063714 ''Battlestar Galactica: The Last Frakkin' Special''] that they are "... messenger(s) of a higher power"&lt;/ref&gt; comment on the recent discovery of what is believed to be "[[mitochondrial Eve]]" in [[Tanzania]]... the remains of Hera Agathon, progenitor of modern-day humanity.  Inner Six disagrees with her counterpart about humanity's next future: when a complex system repeats, something new is bound to happen, and ''this'' Earth—descendants of devastated planets [[Kobol]], the [[Twelve Colonies]], and the [[Earth (Battlestar Galactica)|original Earth]]—may escape the vicious cycle of technology, surmising it to be a part of God's plan.  Inner Baltar reminds her "It doesn't like that name," as the two stroll away.   The episode and series end with a montage showing the progress of robotics in modern society indicating that it all had happened before... and still might happen again.

Before entering coordinates on the FTL-drive control console, Starbuck says 'there must be some kind of way out of here' which is the opening lyric of [[Bob Dylan]]'s song "[[All Along the Watchtower]]".  The coordinates she enters are revealed through flashbacks to be the numerical representation of the opening notes of that same tune. The song is a recurring motif throughout the fourth season and the version sung by [[Jimi Hendrix]] is played at the end of the episode.&lt;ref name=starledger /&gt;

The episode was partially shot in the area of [[Kamloops]], [[British Columbia]], [[Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tnrdfilm.com/past-productions?p=bsgfinal |title=Past Productions &amp;#124; Thompson-Nicola Film Commission |publisher=Tnrdfilm.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original cut of the episode (all three parts) ran over four hours long.

Show creator Ronald D. Moore appears in a short cameo in the epilogue, as the long haired man reading the fictional edition of [[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]] in which the archaeological story is featured.

==Reception==
"Daybreak (Part 2)" was watched by 2.4 million total viewers, a 56% surge from the season three finale and the series' best numbers since the season 2.5 premiere, "[[Resurrection Ship|Resurrection Ship, Part 1]]."&lt;ref name="ratings"&gt;{{cite web|author=Mitovich, Matt |title=Ratings: How Many Went Along for Galactica's Final Trip? |work=[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]] |date=2009-03-21 |url=http://www.seattlepi.com/tvguide/404108_tvgif21.html }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cable"&gt;{{cite web |author=Weprin, Alex |title='Battlestar Galactica' Finale Delivers Most Viewers In Three Years |work=[[Broadcasting &amp; Cable]] |date=2009-03-21 |url= http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/190429-_Battlestar_Galactica_Finale_Delivers_Most_Viewers_In_Three_Years.php |accessdate=2011-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to a 1.7 [[Share (ratings)|household rating]].&lt;ref name="Cable" /&gt; The series finale also drew 1.5 million viewers in the key 18-to-49-year-old demographic, and 1.6 million viewers aged 25-to-54, the best in each demographic since "[[Resurrection Ship|Resurrection Ship, Part 2]]."&lt;ref name="Cable" /&gt; The numbers do not take into account timeshifting via [[digital video recorder]]s, which typically adds another 700,000 ''Battlestar Galactica'' viewers per episode.&lt;ref name="ratings" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cable" /&gt;

Critical reception of the finale varied. Alan Sepinwall of ''The Star Ledger'' wrote "so the amazing four-year journey of ''Battlestar Galactica'' comes to an end, and I feel very, very good about it–even as I suspect others may not."&lt;ref name=starledger /&gt; Mary McNamara of the ''Los Angeles Times'' praised Moore and the writing team for "not copping out" and commented that it was "hard to imagine a more visually and thematically satisfying finale".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=McNamara |first=Mary |title='Battlestar Galactica' finale is satisfying -- so say we all |publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=2009-03-20 |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2009/mar/20/entertainment/et-battlestar20 |accessdate=2011-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Richard Vine of ''The Guardian'' opined that "somehow, out of all the doom and gloom, death, destruction and nihilism we've had, ''Battlestar Galactica'' finished with something approaching a happy ending." He concluded that the episode was ultimately satisfying, noting that "most of the major questions were dealt with in some form or another."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Vine |first=Richard |title=Battlestar Galactica: season four, episode 22 |publisher=The Guardian |date=2009-04-11 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/tvandradioblog/2009/mar/24/battlestar-galactica-television |accessdate=2011-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Renowned fantasy author [[George R.R. Martin]] expressed his extreme dissatisfaction, commenting: "''Battlestar Galactica'' ends with 'God Did It.' Looks like somebody skipped Writing 101, when you learn that a deus ex machina is a crappy way to end a story.  Yeah, yeah, sometimes the journey is its own reward. I certainly enjoyed much of the journey with BSG.  But damn it, doesn't anybody know how to write an ending any more?  Writing 101, kids. Adam and Eve, God Did It, It Was All a Dream?

[[File:AngolaLAPrison.jpg|thumb|[[Louisiana State Penitentiary]], the setting of the work]]
'''''Dead Man Walking''''' (1993) is a work of non-fiction by Sister [[Helen Prejean]], a [[Roman Catholic nun]] and one of the [[Sisters of Saint Joseph of Medaille]] based in New Orleans. Arising from her work as a spiritual adviser to two convicted murderers on [[Death Row]], the book is set largely at the [[Louisiana State Penitentiary]] (Angola) in [[West Feliciana Parish, Louisiana]]. It examines moral issues related to the men's acknowledgement of their crimes and to the state's use of the death penalty.&lt;ref&gt;Schaller, Linda. "[https://www.pbs.org/kqed/onenight/about/producer.html The Producer's Journey]." [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]]. Retrieved on September 1, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Prejean has become a leading American advocate for the abolition of the death penalty. Her campaign was initiated following her correspondence and visits that she maintained with two convicted murderers. She started this ministry in 1982. The first man was [[Elmo Patrick Sonnier]], who was sentenced to death by electric chair. She visited Sonnier in prison and agreed to be his spiritual adviser in the months leading up to his death. The second was [[Robert Lee Willie]], for whom she also served as spiritual adviser.

Prejean gained insight into the minds of these convicted murderers and the process involved in executions, including its effects on the prison guards and other personnel. She became convinced that the state's use of the death penalty was morally wrong and began speaking out against [[capital punishment]]. At the same time, she founded ''Survive'', an organization devoted to providing counseling to the families of victims of violence.

==Name==
The title of the book comes from a phrase once traditional in American prisons, to designate a man condemned to death. They were held on what was known as Death Row, deprived of most social contact and unable to work or participate in prison programs. Prior to the 1960s, when guards would lead a condemned man down the prison hallway, they would call out, "Dead man walking! Dead man walking here!" The origin of the phrase is debated. It may have been to warn other staff or prisoners, to let them know they should be on their guard since a [[death row]] prisoner has nothing to lose and could be violent. It may also have been a kind of [[honorific]] declamation, to let other prisoners know that they should move out of the way - death row prisoners being seen as an [[elite]] within the prison system. Alternatively, the call may have been a [[Social stigma|stigma]] attached to the condemned man, to remind others within earshot not to touch him in order not to catch his bad luck. In any case, its symbolism is clear: the condemned prisoner, in the eyes of the law, was dead already.

==Adaptations==

===Film===
{{Main article|Dead Man Walking (film)}}
In 1995, a film based on the book was made, starring [[Susan Sarandon]] and [[Sean Penn]].

===Opera===
{{Main article|Dead Man Walking (opera)}}
The book was adapted as an [[Dead Man Walking (opera)|opera]] of the same name, composed by [[Jake Heggie]] with a libretto by playwright [[Terrence McNally]]. It premiered at the [[San Francisco Opera]] in October 2000. The international premiere of the opera was in August 2003, in Adelaide. It has been produced in several other cities, including by the [[Union Avenue Opera]] in St. Louis, Missouri.

{{Unreferenced|date=April 2008}}

'''Diminution''' is a [[satire|satirical]] technique. It reduces the size of something in order that it may be made to appear ludicrous, or in order to be closely examined. For example, if the Canadian Members of Parliament are portrayed as squabbling, spoiled little boys and girls, this would be diminution. A diminutive satire is ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5119">The '''English Broadside Ballad Archive''' ('''EBBA''') is a [[digital library]] of 17th-century English [[Broadside (music)#Broadside ballads|Broadside Ballads]], a project of the English Department of the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]]. The project archives ballads in multiple accessible digital formats.

==History==

The English Broadside Ballad Archive was created in 2003 by Patricia Fumerton, Professor of English at [[University of California, Santa Barbara|UCSB]] to digitize broadside ballads of the heyday of the 17th century. Many of these ballads are currently held in difficult to access libraries in both North America and the United Kingdom, often in fragile condition, and EBBA’s aim is to make them accessible to users in a variety of digital formats. Since then, EBBA has received six Collections and Resources grants from the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] (NEH), an NEH Digital Humanities Start-Up Grant, and Faculty Research Grants and Instructional Improvement Grants from the University of California, Santa Barbara. As of August 2015, the project has archived over 7000 of the estimated 11,000 extant broadside ballads.

==Scope==

As of August 2015, '''EBBA''' has archived 7,124 broadside ballads, from 20 different collections held at six different libraries worldwide. The collections range from the very well-known and recognized by name - such as those housed at the [[Pepys Library]] of [[Magdalene College, Cambridge]] - to the relatively unknown. The project has currently archived ballads from the following libraries, with partnerships in place to begin archiving ballads from several other libraries in the next two years.

===Holding Libraries and Named Collections===

* [[British Library]]
** [[Roxburghe Ballads]]
* [[Glasgow University Library]]
** Euing Collection
* [[Houghton Library]] of [[Harvard University]]
** [[Alfred Henry Huth|Huth]] Collection
* [[Huntington Library]]
** [[James Bindley|Bindley]] Collection
** Bridgewater Collection
** Britwell Collection
* [[Magdalene College, Cambridge]]
** [[Pepys Library|Pepys Ballads]]
* [[National Library of Scotland]]
** Crawford Collection
** Rosebery Collection

==Archival Formats==

In addition to cataloging all of its holdings exhaustively, '''EBBA''' archives ballads in up to five different formats, all designed to make the ballads more accessible to modern scholars and members of the public.

===Ballad Facsimile===

All ballads are archived on the website as a high quality, 600 dpi image of the ballad sheet, trimmed with a 2mm margin.

===Album Facsimile===

Those ballads that were pasted into albums or archived in any format other than loose-leaf are also archived on the website in another high quality photograph of the ballad sheet on its surrounding album page.

===Transcriptions===

All ballads, often originally rendered in difficult to read [[black letter]], or Gothic font, and other early modern typefaces, are transcribed into Times New Roman using a diplomatic double-keyed transcription process, and those transcriptions are included in the archive.

===Facsimile Transcriptions===

All ballads are archived in Facsimile Transcriptions, in which the original blocks of text from the Ballad Facsimile have been replaced with blocks of text from the modern transcription, resulting in an image that preserves the visual experience of the original ballad, including woodcut impression illustrations, yet is easily readable by a modern audience.

===Ballad Recording===

Many broadside ballads include a tune imprint, indicating to which well-known tune they were meant to be sung. For those ballads for which '''EBBA''' has been able to identify the tune, recordings of the sung ballad are available on the archive.

==Examples of Notable Holdings==

* [[Barbara Allen (song)|Barbara Allen]]
* [[The Ballad of Chevy Chase|Chevy Chase]]
* Unexpected Perspectives such as [[Lady Isabel's Tragedy]]
* Many Robin Hood Ballads including [[Robin Hood's Progress to Nottingham]]
* Examples of the [[Titus Andronicus (ballad)|Titus Andronicus]] tradition

The '''Fair Housing Assistance Program (FHAP)''' is a federal program that is administered by the [[Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity]] at the [[U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development]].  The FHAP program provides funding annually on a noncompetitive basis to State and local agencies that enforce fair housing laws that are substantially equivalent to the Fair Housing Act.  
	
Eligible grantees must be a state or local agency that enforces a fair housing law that is substantially equivalent to the [[Fair Housing Act]].  This means that the law provides substantive rights, procedures, remedies, and judicial review provisions that are similar to those under the Fair Housing Act.  In determining eligibility, HUD may also take into consideration whether the jurisdiction is already served by a FHAP agency.  
	
A number of activities are eligible for funding.  FHAP-funded activities may include fair housing administrative and enforcement activities, including complaint processing, training, implementation of data and information systems, and other special projects.

Details regarding the [[Federal government of the United States|federal]] definition of finance charge are found in the [[Truth-in-Lending Act]] and [[Regulation Z]], promulgated by the [[Federal Reserve Board]].

In personal finance, a finance charge may be considered simply the dollar amount paid to borrow money, while interest is a percentage amount paid such as [[annual percentage rate]] (APR).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kapoor |first1=Jack R. |first2=Les R. |last2=Dlabay |first3=Robert J. |last3=Hughes |title=Focus on Personal Finance |year=2007 |edition=2nd |series=Mcgraw-Hill/Irwin Series in Finance, Insurance and Real Estate |publisher=Mcgraw-Hill |isbn=0-07-353063-8 |page= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  These definitions are narrower than the typical dictionary definitions or accounting definitions.

Creditors and lenders use different methods to calculate finance charges.  The most common formula is based on the average daily balance, in which daily outstanding balances are added together and then divided by the number of days in the month.

In financial accounting, interest is defined as any charge or cost of borrowing money.  Interest is a synonym for finance charge.  In effect, the accountant looks at the entire cost of settlement on a [[United States Department of Housing and Urban Development|Housing and Urban Development]] (HUD) form 1 (the [[HUD-1 Settlement Statement]]) document as interest unless that charge can be identified as an escrow amount or an amount that is charged to current expenses or expenditures other than interest, such as payment of current or prorated real estate taxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Accredited Business Accountant Review Course |last=Giovetti |first=Al |year=2008 |publisher=Accreditation Council on Accounting and Taxation |isbn= |page= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The journal has no [[article processing charge]]s and no advertisements. &lt;ref name="Open Access success" /&gt; 

==History==
According to the chief editor, Edward Valauskas, the journal emerged before the open access model emerged:
&lt;blockquote&gt;“We didn’t call it open access in 1995 but we were certainly a precursor to the whole notion of open access. We felt very strongly that the journal should have all its content made freely available and we insisted with [the Danish publisher] Munksgaard that the scholars who contributed would retain copyright of their work that they published in the journal. We felt it would encourage scholars to contribute and then re-use their content in lots of different ways".&lt;ref name="Open Access success" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''First Monday'' originated in the summer of 1995 with a proposal to start a new Internet-only, peer-reviewed journal about the Internet by eventual [[editor-in-chief]] [[Edward J. Valauskas]] to [[Wiley-Blackwell|Munksgaard]], a [[Denmark|Danish]] publisher. Munksgaard agreed to publish the journal in September 1995. The first issue appeared on 6 May 1996, the first Monday of May, also the opening of the Fifth [[International World Wide Web Conference]] in Paris. The first issue was distributed at that conference on diskette as well as released on the Internet from a server in Copenhagen at the address www.firstmonday.dk.

In December 1998, Munksgaard sold the journal to three of the editors: Edward J. Valauskas, Esther Dyson, and Rishab Aiyer Ghosh. The server was moved from Copenhagen to the University of Illinois at Chicago’s Library. The first issue based on a server in Chicago appeared 4 January 1999.

===Conferences===
The first ''First Monday'' conference took place 4–6 November 2001 in [[Maastricht]] at the International Institute of [[Infonomics]]. To celebrate ''First Monday’s'' 10th birthday in 2006, a conference took place at the University of Illinois at Chicago, 15–17 May 2006. The theme of the conference was ''Openness: Code, science and content.'' Over 200 participants from over 30 countries took part in the meeting. Papers from the Conference were published in the June and July issues. The conference was sponsored by The [[Open Society Institute]], The [[John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation]], The University of Illinois at [[Chicago University Library]] and [[The Maastricht Economic Research Institute on Innovation and Technology]] (MERIT), [[University of Maastricht]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8257">'''Forensic rhetoric''', as coined in [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[On Rhetoric]]'', encompasses any discussion of past action including legal discourse—the primary setting for the emergence of [[rhetoric]] as a discipline and theory. This contrasts with [[deliberative rhetoric]] and [[epideictic|epideictic rhetoric]], which are reserved for discussions concerning future and present actions respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, On Rhetoric, 1.3.10-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

In contemporary times, the word ''forensic'' is commonly associated with [[Criminal law|criminal]] and [[Civil law (common law)|civil law]] referring specifically to [[forensic science]]. It is important to note that the term ''forensic'' associated with criminal investigation exists because forensic (or judicial) rhetoric first existed.&lt;ref&gt;George Kennedy, Aristotle On Rhetoric: A Theory of Civic Discourse, (New York: Oxford University Press, 1991), 87-118.&lt;/ref&gt;

==References in ''On Rhetoric''==

An introduction of the three types of rhetoric (forensic, deliberative, and epideictic) occurs in Book I Chapter III of Aristotle's ''On Rhetoric''.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy 1991, 87.&lt;/ref&gt;  Discussion of forensic rhetoric is found in Book I Chapters X-XV, outlined as follows:

* Chapter 10: "Topics about [[Wrongdoing]]" asserts: "Let wrongdoing be defined as doing harm willingly in contravention of the law."&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, 1.3.10.&lt;/ref&gt;  Aristotle also defines three considerations of forensic rhetoric: 1. For what purposes persons do wrong 2. How these persons are mentally disposed 3. What kind of persons they wrong and what these persons are like.
* Chapter 11: "Topics about Pleasure" categorizes pleasure as natural, not compulsive, and can be the cause of crime: gaining revenge, winning, or restoring honor.
* Chapter 12: "Topics about Wrongdoers and Those Wronged" includes many features of both the wrongdoers and the wronged that relate to criminalities:
**Wrongdoers: believe they will not be detected or punished, are likely to go unsuspected if their appearance is inconsistent with the charges (a weak man charged with assault), have either no enemy or many enemies.
**Those who are wronged: have something the wrongdoer lacks, do not live cautiously, have never been wronged, or have been often wronged with no retaliation.
* Chapter 13: "Topics about [[Justice]] and [[Injustice]]" discusses the [[law]] in two ways: specific (that which has been defined for each person) and common (that which is based on nature or common principle).
* Chapter 14: "The Koinon of Degree of Magnitude" proposes: "A wrong is greater insofar as it is caused by greater injustice. Thus the least wrong can sometimes be the greatest."&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''On Rhetoric'', 1.3.14.&lt;/ref&gt;  Aristotle asserts that varying degrees of wrong exist based on the accessibility of retribution from the wronged and [[punishment]] for the wrongdoer.
* Chapter 15: "Atechnic Pisteis in Judicial Rhetoric: Laws, Witnesses, Contracts, Tortures, Oaths" summarizes the objects listed in its title, including evidence that supports or refutes a case. These summaries and guidelines are very practical in law both in Aristotle's and in modern times. Aristotle also focuses on fairness and introduces the possibility that the [[defendant]] could be legally guilty yet morally justified.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy 1991, 87-118.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early connection between law and rhetoric==

According to [[George A. Kennedy (classicist)|George A. Kennedy]], rhetoric emerged as a response to legal freedoms introduced in Greece around 467BC. "Citizens found themselves involved in [[litigation]]... and were forced to take up their own cases before the courts. A few clever [[Sicilians]] developed simple techniques for effective presentation and [[argumentation]] in the law courts and taught them to others."&lt;ref name="Jasinski"&gt;James Jasinski, "Forensic Discourse," ''Sourcebook on Rhetoric'' (2001).&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, trained capacity in speech-making and the theory about such speech-making exists because of legal exigencies.

The Stasis Doctrine, proposed by [[Hermagoras of Temnos|Hermagoras]], is an approach to systematically analyze legal cases, which many scholars include in their treatises of rhetoric, most famously in [[Cicero]]’s "[[De Inventione]]."&lt;ref&gt;Jakes Jasinski, "Stasis," ''Sourcebook on Rhetoric'' (2001).&lt;/ref&gt;  Encyclopedia author [[James Jasinski]] describes this doctrine as taxonomy to classify relevant questions in a debate and the existence or nonexistence of a fact in law.&lt;ref name="Jasinski-p530"&gt;Jasinski 2001, 530.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Stasis Doctrine is incorporated in rhetoric handbooks today.&lt;ref name="Jasinski-p530" /&gt;

==Traditional connection between law and rhetoric==
Since forensic rhetoric’s original purpose was to win courtroom cases, legal aids have been trained in it since legal [[freedoms]] emerged. Because in early law [[courts]], citizens were expected to represent themselves and training in forensic rhetoric was very beneficial.&lt;ref&gt;George A. Kennedy, Classical Rhetoric &amp; its Christian and Secular Tradition from Ancient to Modern Times, (Chapel Hill: The University of North Carolina Press, 1999), 20-21.&lt;/ref&gt; In ancient Athens, litigants in a private law suit and defendants in a criminal prosecution were expected to handle their own case before the court - a practice that Aristotle approved of. The hearings would consist of questions addressed to the litigant/defendant and were asked by a member of the Court, or the litigants could ask one another; these circumstances did not call for legal or oratorical talent - therefore oratory or legalism was not expected, encouraged, or appreciated. After the time of Solon, the Court of Areopagus was replaced and the litigant/defendant would deliver a prepared speech before the courts to try and sway the jury; they expected dramatic and brilliant oratorical displays. Now, listeners appreciated oratorical and even legalistic niceties, such as appeals to passion, piety, and prejudice. It was at this point in Athens history where the forensic speech-writer made his first appearance. The speech-writer would prepare an address which the litigant/defendant memorized and delivered before the court. Forensic speech-writing and oratory soon became an essential part of general rhetoric.&lt;ref&gt;[[Anton-Hermann Chroust]], Legal Profession in Ancient Athens, 29 Notre Dame L. Rev. 339 (1954).&lt;/ref&gt;  After the nineteenth century, forensic rhetoric “became the exclusive province of lawyers,” as it essentially remains today.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy 1999, 28.&lt;/ref&gt;  These people were experts in the court system and dominated forensic rhetoric, since it is tied to past events—thus the relationship between law and rhetoric was solidified.&lt;ref&gt;Laurent Pernot, Rhetoric in Antiquity, (Washington, D.C.: The Catholic University of America Press, 2005), 190.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contemporary connection between law and rhetoric==

The [[critical legal studies]] movement occurred because as [[John Lucaites|John L. Lucaites]], a prominent author on the subject, concluded both [[legal studies]] and rhetorical scholars desire to demystify complex law discourse.&lt;ref&gt;J. L. Lucaites, "Between Rhetoric and "The Law": Power, Legitimacy, and Social Change,"Quarterly Journal, 76 (1990): 379-96.&lt;/ref&gt;  His task was to "explore how 'the law'—conceptualized as a series of institutional procedures and relationships—functions within a larger 'rhetorical culture'."&lt;ref name="Jasinski" /&gt;

Author [[James Boyd White]] cultivated the [[law and literature]] movement, promoting the relationship between law and rhetoric at the constitutive level of discourse.&lt;ref&gt;Jasinski 2001, 262.&lt;/ref&gt;  The name ''law and literature'' relates to both the study of law in literature (such as legal fiction) and law as literature (the community built from a discourse community).&lt;ref&gt;Steven Mailloux, ''Rhetorical Power'', (Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 1989).&lt;/ref&gt; This movement asserts that the process of interpretation, both in law and literature, is rhetorical: "interpretation is a process of constructing arguments and the meaning of a text emerges through rhetorical interaction."&lt;ref name="Jasinski" /&gt;

The '''Gambier Parry process''' is a development of the classical technique of [[fresco]] for painting [[mural]]s, named for [[Thomas Gambier Parry]].

True fresco is the technique of painting on fresh lime plaster whereby the pigments are fixed by the [[carbonatation]] of the lime (calcium hydroxide). The technique requires no other binding medium and the fixing process  produces a durable crystalline paint layer. However, only a limited range of pigments are suitable for true frescoes and the technique requires careful application under controlled conditions, and relatively low humidity thereafter. In some environments, conventional fresco colours can rapidly accumulate dirt and grime. The decoration of the new [[Houses of Parliament#Royal Gallery|Houses of Parliament]] in the mid-nineteenth century saw an embarrassing failure of true fresco in England but had generated a revival in mural painting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/journals/conservation-journal/issue-17/conservation-of-lord-leightons-spirit-frescoes-war-and-peace/ Conservation of Lord Leighton's Spirit Frescoes 'War' and 'Peace'] Stephen Rickerby&lt;/ref&gt; 

Gambier Parry developed a spirit medium for use on a specially prepared plaster or canvas ground and in 1862 he published his recipe. Originally it used [[beeswax]], [[Lavender oil|oil of spike lavender]], spirits of [[turpentine]], [[Canarium luzonicum|elemi resin]] and [[copal]] varnish, and was complex both in preparing the wall surface and applying the paint.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/journals/conservation-journal/issue-17/conservation-of-lord-leightons-spirit-frescoes-war-and-peace/ Conservation of Lord Leighton's Spirit Frescoes 'War' and 'Peace'] Stephen Rickerby&lt;/ref&gt; With commercialisation the process was simplified and became widely known.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.parishofmorpeth.org.uk/stjames/pc01.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The system was used by [[Frederic Leighton]] for ''[[Leighton Frescoes|The Arts of Industry as Applied to War]]'' and ''[[Leighton Frescoes|The Arts of Industry as Applied to Peace]]'' at the [[Victoria &amp; Albert Museum]] (1870-72)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/journals/conservation-journal/issue-17/conservation-of-lord-leightons-spirit-frescoes-war-and-peace/ Conservation of Lord Leighton's Spirit Frescoes 'War' and 'Peace'] Stephen Rickerby&lt;/ref&gt; and by [[Ford Madox Brown]] on the ''[[The Manchester Murals|Manchester Murals]]''  in [[Manchester Town Hall]] (1879-93).&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Arts and Crafts Essays/Of Mural Painting|''Of Mural Painting'']] F. Madox Brown&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most complete examples of the Gambier Parry process may be seen at St Leonard's Church, [[Newland, Worcestershire|Newland]], Worcestershire&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stleonardsnewland.org/murals.html&lt;/ref&gt; where frescoes cover the interior of the church;  St Leonard's is the private chapel of the Beauchamp Almshouses.

The '''Gezer calendar''' is a small inscribed limestone tablet discovered in 1908 by Irish archaeologist [[R. A. Stewart Macalister]] in the ancient [[Canaan]]ite city of [[Gezer]], 20 miles west of [[Jerusalem]]. It is commonly dated to the 10th century BCE, although the excavation was [[Stratigraphy (archaeology)|unstratified]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Tappy |first1=Ron E. |first2=P.

Quote: "The first thing to consider when examining an ancient inscription is whether it was discovered in context or not. It is obvious that a document purchased on the antiquities market is suspect. If it was found in an archeological site, one should note whether it was found in its primary context, as with the [[Ekron inscription|inscription of King Achish from Ekron]], or in secondary use, as with the Tel Dan inscription. Of course texts that were found in an archaeological site, but not in a secure archaeological context present certain problems of exact dating, as with the Gezer Calendar."&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars are divided as to whether the language is [[Phoenician language|Phoenician]] or [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and whether the script is [[Phoenician alphabet|Phoenician]] (or [[Proto-Canaanite alphabet|Proto-Canaanite]]) or [[Paleo-Hebrew alphabet|paleo-Hebrew]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Smith|first1=Mark S.|year=2002 |title=The Early History of God: Yahweh and the other deities in ancient Israel |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1yM3AuBh4AsC&amp;pg=PA20&amp;dq=Gezer+calendar+phoenician&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=0PJqTYylDoiahQfR7-zsDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Gezer%20calendar%20phoenician&amp;f=false |pages=20|publisher=Wm.

==Inscription==
The calendar is inscribed on a limestone plaque and describes monthly or bi-monthly periods and attributes to each a duty such as harvest, planting, or tending specific crops. 

The inscription is in [[Phoenician alphabet|Phoenician]] or [[Paleo-Hebrew alphabet|paleo-Hebrew]] script:&lt;br&gt;

Scholars have speculated that the calendar could be a schoolboy's memory exercise, the text of a popular [[folk song]] or a children's song. Another possibility is something designed for the collection of taxes from farmers.

The [[scribe]] of the calendar is probably "Abijah", which means "Yah (a shortened form of the [[Tetragrammaton]]) is my father". This name appears in the Bible for several individuals, including a king of Judah (1 Kings 14:31).

==History ==
The [[calendar]] was discovered in 1908 by [[R.A.S. Macalister]] of the [[Palestine Exploration Fund]] while excavating the  ancient [[Canaan]]ite city of [[Gezer]], 20 miles west of Jerusalem. 

The Gezer calendar is currently displayed at the Museum of the Ancient Orient, a [[Istanbul Archaeology Museums|Turkish archaeology museum]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.istanbularkeoloji.gov.tr/web/27-109-1-1/muze_-_en/collections/archaeological_museum_artifacts/gezer_calendar Gezer calendar] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121101043950/http://www.istanbularkeoloji.gov.tr/web/27-109-1-1/muze_-_en/collections/archaeological_museum_artifacts/gezer_calendar |date=2012-11-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.istanbularkeoloji.gov.tr/web/27-109-1-1/muze_-_en/collections/archaeological_museum_artifacts/gezer_calendar Istanbul Archaeological Museums, Artifacts] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121101043950/http://www.istanbularkeoloji.gov.tr/web/27-109-1-1/muze_-_en/collections/archaeological_museum_artifacts/gezer_calendar |date=2012-11-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as is the [[Siloam inscription]] and other archaeological artifacts unearthed before [[World War I]]. A replica of the Gezer calendar is on display at the [[Israel Museum]], Israel.

{{Atheism sidebar|types}}

'''Implicit atheism''' and '''explicit atheism''' are types of [[atheism]].&lt;ref name="smith"/&gt; In [[George H. Smith]]'s ''Atheism: The Case Against God'', "implicit atheism" is defined as "the absence of theistic belief without a conscious rejection of it",  while "explicit atheism" is "the absence of theistic belief due to a conscious rejection of it".&lt;ref name="smith"&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.positiveatheism.org/writ/smith.htm |title=Atheism: The Case Against God |first=George H. |last=Smith |location=Buffalo, New York |year=1979 |publisher=Prometheus |isbn=0-87975-124-X |pages=13–18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000831235652/http://www.positiveatheism.org/writ/smith.htm |archivedate=2000-08-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Explicit atheists have considered the idea of [[Deity|deities]] and have rejected belief that any exist. Implicit atheists, though they do not themselves maintain a belief in a god or gods, have not rejected the notion or have not considered it further.

== Implicit atheism ==
"Implicit atheism" is "the absence of theistic belief without a conscious rejection of it". "Absence of theistic belief" encompasses all forms of non-belief in deities. This would categorize as implicit atheists those adults who have never heard of the concept of deities, and those adults who have not given the idea any real consideration. Also included are agnostics who assert they do not believe in any deities (even if they claim not to be atheists), and children.  As far back as 1772, [[Baron d'Holbach]] said that "All children are born Atheists; they have no idea of God".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=d'Holbach |first=P. H. T. |authorlink=Baron d'Holbach |title=Good Sense |year=1772 |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/7319 |accessdate=2010-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smith is silent on newborn children, but clearly identifies as atheists some children who are unaware of any concept of any deity:
{{Quote
 | The man who is unacquainted with theism is an atheist because he does not believe in a god. This category would also include the child with the conceptual capacity to grasp the issues involved, but who is still unaware of those issues. The fact that this child does not believe in god qualifies him as an atheist.&lt;ref name="smith"/&gt;
}}

== Explicit atheism ==
Smith observes that some motivations for explicit atheism are rational and some not. Of the rational motivations, he says:
{{Quote
 | The most significant variety of atheism is explicit atheism of a philosophical nature. This atheism contends that the belief in god is irrational and should therefore be rejected. Since this version of explicit atheism rests on a criticism of theistic beliefs, it is best described as ''critical atheism''.&lt;ref name="smith"/&gt;
}}

For Smith, critical, explicit atheism is subdivided further into three groups:&lt;ref name="smith"/&gt;{{ssup|&amp;nbsp;p.17}}
# the view usually expressed by the statement "I do not believe in the existence of a god or supernatural being" after "the failure of theism to provide sufficient evidence in its favor. Faced with a lack of evidence, this explicit atheist sees no reason whatsoever for believing in a supernatural being";
# the view usually expressed by the statement "God does not exist" or "the existence of God is impossible" after "a particular concept of god, such as the God of Christianity, is judged to be absurd or contradictory";
# the view which "refuses to discuss the existence or nonexistence of a god" because "the concept of a 'god' is unintelligible".

For the purposes of his paper on "philosophical atheism", [[Ernest Nagel]] chose to attach only the explicit atheism definition for his examination and discussion:
{{Quote
 | I must begin by stating what sense I am attaching to the word "atheism," and how I am construing the theme of this paper. I shall understand by "atheism" a critique and a denial of the major claims of all varieties of theism. [...] atheism is not to be identified with sheer unbelief, or with disbelief in some particular creed of a religious group. Thus, a child who has received no religious instruction and has never heard about God, is not an atheist – for he is not denying any theistic claims. Similarly in the case of an adult who, if he has withdrawn from the faith of his father without reflection or because of frank indifference to any theological issue, is also not an atheist – for such an adult is not challenging theism and not professing any views on the subject. [...] I propose to examine some ''philosophic'' concepts of atheism...&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Basic Beliefs: The Religious Philosophies of Mankind |chapter=Philosophical Concepts of Atheism |first=Ernest |last=Nagel |authorlink=Ernest Nagel |year=1959 |publisher=Sheridan House}}&lt;br/&gt;reprinted in ''Critiques of God'', edited by Peter A. Angeles, Prometheus Books, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In Nagel's ''Philosophical Concepts of Atheism'', he very much agrees with Smith on the three-part subdivision of "explicit atheism" above, though Nagel does not use the term "explicit".

== Other typologies of atheism ==
{{further|Atheism#Definitions and distinctions}}

The specific narrow focus on [[Negative and positive atheism|positive atheism]] taken by some professional philosophers like Nagel on the one hand, compared with the scholarship on traditional negative atheism of freethinkers like [[Baron d'Holbach|d'Holbach]] and Smith on the other has been attributed to the different concerns of professional philosophers and layman proponents of atheism, {{Quote| "If so many atheists and some of their critics have insisted on the negative definition of atheism, why have some modern philosophers called for a positive definition of atheism -- atheism as the outright denial of God's existence? Part of the reason, I suspect, lies in the chasm separating freethinkers and academic philosophers. Most modern philosophers are totally unfamiliar with atheistic literature and so remain oblivious to the tradition of negative atheism contained in that literature. (see Smith (1990, Chapter 3, p.&amp;nbsp;51-60&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.positiveatheism.org/writ/smithdef.htm |title=Atheism, Ayn Rand, and Other Heresies |last=Smith |first=George H. |year=1990 |pages=51–60 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080713012926/http://www.positiveatheism.org/writ/smithdef.htm |archivedate=2008-07-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;))}}

Everitt (2004) makes the point that professional philosophers are more interested in the grounds for giving or withholding assent to propositions:
&lt;blockquote&gt; We need to distinguish between a ''biographical'' or ''sociological'' enquiry into why some people have believed or disbelieved in God, and an ''[[epistemological]]'' enquiry into whether there are any good reasons for either belief or unbelief... We are interested in the question of what ''good reasons'' there are for or against God's existence, and no light is thrown on that question by discovering people who hold their beliefs without having good reasons for them.&lt;ref&gt;Everitt, Nicholas, ''The Non-existence of God: An Introduction''. London: Routledge, 2004 ({{ISBN|0-415-30107-6}}), p.&amp;nbsp;10.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

So, sometimes in philosophy (Flew, Martin and Nagel notwithstanding), only the explicit "denial of theistic belief" is examined, rather than the broader, implicit subject of atheism.

The terms [[Weak and strong atheism|"weak atheism" and "strong atheism"]], also known as "negative atheism" and "positive atheism", are usually used by Smith as synonyms of the less well-known "implicit" and "explicit" categories. "Strong explicit" atheists assert that it is false that any deities exist. "Weak explicit" atheists assert they do not believe in deities, and do not assert it is ''true'' that deities do not exist. Those who do not believe any deities exist, and do not assert their non-belief are included among implicit atheists. Among weak implicit atheists are included the following: children and adults who have never heard of deities; people who have heard of deities but have never given the idea any considerable thought; and those agnostics who suspend belief about deities, but do not reject such belief.&lt;ref name="smith"/&gt;

'''Lead contamination in Oakland''' represents a serious and persistent public health threat. Significant portions of the City of [[Oakland, California]] have soil lead levels far in excess of 400 ppm, the level that the US EPA suggests remedial action be taken at, and far higher than 80 ppm, the level that California’s Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment suggests action should be taken at.&lt;ref name=80ppm&gt;{{cite news|last=Young|first=Alison|title=EPA fails to revise key lead-poisoning hazard standards|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/03/10/epa-has-not-revised-lead-hazard-standards-for-dust-and-soil/1971209/|accessdate=11 August 2013|newspaper=USA Today|date=10 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;   [[Lead contamination]] in modern Oakland comes from three primary sources: remnants from previous industry, deposits from pre-ban [[leaded gasoline]], and paint chips from pre-ban [[leaded paint]]s.&lt;ref name=coastguard&gt;{{cite web|last=Young|first=Stephanie|title=Battling lead contamination, one fish bone at a time|url=http://coastguard.dodlive.mil/2012/07/battling-lead-contamination-one-fish-bone-at-a-time/|publisher=Coast Guard|accessdate=11 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=usatoday&gt;{{cite news|last=Eisler|first=Peter|title=Ghost Factories: Smelting and Lead Contamination|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/nation/smelting-lead-contamination-ipad#sites/449|accessdate=11 August 2013|newspaper=USA Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;    Not all areas of Oakland are affected equally: West Oakland's contamination is especially severe, particularly near the former [[Oakland Army Base]], and many of Oakland's poorer neighborhoods also suffer disproportionately (since residents often lack the socioeconomic resources to remediate their lawns, or even to repaint their houses).&lt;ref name=nathan&gt;{{cite journal|last=McClintock|first=Nathan|title=Assessing soil lead contamination at multiple scales in Oakland, California: Implications for urban agriculture and environmental justice|journal=Applied Geography|date=1 November 2012|volume=35|issue=1–2|pages=460–473|doi=10.1016/j.apgeog.2012.10.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

High blood levels of lead have been linked to a [[lead poisoning|wide variety of health problems]], including severe gastrointestinal, neuromuscular, and neurological symptoms.&lt;ref name=medline/&gt;&lt;ref name=onorth/&gt;  These problems are especially significant in children, and childhood lead poisoning can lead to behavioral problems, developmental disorders, and permanent decreases in IQ.&lt;ref name=medline&gt;{{cite web|title=Lead poisoning|url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002473.htm|work=MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia|publisher=NIH|accessdate=10 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical context==
[[File:Oakland Chevrolet factory c.1917.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Oakland has long been a center of industry, serving for a time as home of the main Pacific Coast Chevrolet auto plant.]]

Oakland is a historical center of heavy industry, but much of this industry left the city during the 1980s and early 1990s.&lt;ref name=baycit&gt;{{cite news|last=Payton|first=Brenda|title=Oakland's Industry Disappeared—and So Did Middle Class|url=https://www.baycitizen.org/news/politics/oaklands-middle-class-going-down-drain/|accessdate=11 August 2013|newspaper=Bay Citizen|date=8 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This loss of a large number of well-paying blue collar jobs led to a significant decline in the financial situation of many Oaklanders,&lt;ref name=baycit/&gt; and most of the closed manufacturing plants did not perform [[environmental remediation]] before shutting down, leaving many former industrial areas heavily polluted with lead and other contaminants.  The [[Port of Oakland]] is the fourth busiest port in the United States in terms of container traffic,&lt;ref name=port&gt;{{cite web|title=Port of Oakland – Maritime|url=http://www.portofoakland.com/maritime/factsfig.asp|publisher=Port of Oakland|accessdate=11 August 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130808120846/http://portofoakland.com/maritime/factsfig.asp|archivedate=8 August 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Oakland was also historically one of the largest rail hubs on the west coast of the United States.

Oakland was also an early center of [[car culture]], and extensive highway development began to take place starting in the 1950s.&lt;ref name=temescal&gt;{{cite book|last=Norman|first=Jeff|title=Temescal legacies : narratives of change from a North Oakland neighborhood|year=2006|publisher=Shared Ground|location=Oakland, Calif.|isbn=9780977889303}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Leaded gasoline]] was in widespread use in the United States for much of the 20th century, with lead levels gradually being reduced starting in the early 1970s, and leaded gasoline finally being completely banned in 1996.&lt;ref name=epagas&gt;{{cite web|title=Leaded Gas Phaseout|url=http://yosemite.epa.gov/R10/airpage.nsf/webpage/Leaded+Gas+Phaseout|publisher=EPA|accessdate=11 August 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080603152013/http://yosemite.epa.gov/R10/airpage.nsf/webpage/Leaded%2BGas%2BPhaseout|archivedate=3 June 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The use of leaded gasoline contributed greatly to lead contamination in Oakland, especially in areas of the city near its highways.&lt;ref name=amcoepa/&gt;&lt;ref name=leadsurvey&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mielke|first=Howard W.|author2=Laidlaw, Mark A.S. |author3=Gonzales, Chris |title=Lead (Pb) legacy from vehicle traffic in eight California urbanized areas: Continuing influence of lead dust on children's health|journal=Science of the Total Environment|date=1 September 2010|volume=408|issue=19|pages=3965–3975|doi=10.1016/j.scitotenv.2010.05.017|pmid=20542539}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Specific areas==

===West Oakland===

====Oakland Army Base====
The former [[Oakland Army Base]], closed in 1999, is significantly polluted by a variety of substances, including lead.  Sources of lead contamination include the weathering of lead-based paint, repainting vehicles, leaded gasoline, and other factors.&lt;ref name=brac&gt;{{cite web|title=Final Environmental Baseline Survey for Transfer|url=http://www2.oaklandnet.com/oakca/groups/ceda/documents/report/oak031218.pdf|publisher=MWH Americas|accessdate=11 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;   During the time period when the Army was remediating the base, many areas of the base failed to meet their remediation goals.&lt;ref name=brac/&gt;

====Amco====
There was formerly a large chemical distribution facility run by [[AMCO Chemical]] at 1414 3rd Street, just one block south of the West Oakland [[BART]] station.&lt;ref name=amcoepa&gt;{{cite web|title=Superfund Site Overview Amco Chemica, Pacific Southwest, US EPA|url=http://yosemite.epa.gov/r9/sfund/r9sfdocw.nsf/vwsoalphabetic/Amco%20Chemical?OpenDocument|publisher=EPA|accessdate=10 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the 1960s until 1989, bulk chemicals were off-loaded from a rail spur onsite and stored in drums and storage tanks before being transferred to smaller containers for resale. Bulk chemical storage facilities included 12 aboveground tanks, two underground tanks, and numerous drums.&lt;ref name=amcoepa/&gt; AMCO's operations heavily contaminated the surrounding area with a variety of compounds, included chlorinated solvents, vinyl chloride, dioxins, PCBs volatile organic compounds, arsenic, manganese, and significant quantities of lead.&lt;ref name=amcoepa/&gt;  Some of these compounds have either contaminated nearby properties, seeped into the ground water, or both.&lt;ref name=amcoepa/&gt;  The facility has been declared a federal [[superfund]] site.&lt;ref name=amcoepa/&gt;

Soil lead levels both at the AMCO site itself and at many nearby residential properties exceed safety limits, and pose a threat to human safety.&lt;ref name=amcoepa/&gt;  Most other contaminants stemming from the AMCO plant have not spread as widely as the lead has.&lt;ref name=amcoepa/&gt;  As with most other lead contaminated areas, other sources of lead exist, such as lead paint and leaded gasoline.&lt;ref name=amcoepa/&gt;

===Verdese Carter Park===
Verdese Carter Park is a municipal park found at the corner of 96th Avenue and Bancroft, in the Elmhurst district of East Oakland, a primarily African-American and Latino community where most residents are below the poverty line.&lt;ref name=ecy&gt;{{cite journal|title=Final Report. Appendix F: Institutional Frameworks case Study|journal=Washington State Area-Wide Soil Contamination Task Force|year=2003|volume=B}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Verdese Carter Community Garden|url=http://www2.oaklandnet.com/Government/o/opr/s/cgardening/OAK031399|publisher=City of Oakland}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Between 1912 and 1975 the bottom half of the site was occupied by a plant that broke open used batteries and melted their lead to manufacture new batteries,&lt;ref name=ecy/&gt; while the top half of the site was occupied by a greenhouse.&lt;ref name=vcp&gt;{{cite web|title=Superfund Site Overview Verdese Carter Park, Pacific Southwest, USA EPA|url=http://yosemite.epa.gov/r9/sfund/r9sfdocw.nsf/vwsoalphabetic/Verdese+Carter+Park?OpenDocument|publisher=EPA|accessdate=10 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both properties were acquired by the City of Oakland in 1976, and, after two actions aimed at removing lead contaminated soil, the park opened to the public in 1978.&lt;ref name=vcp/&gt;  Before the initial city removal actions, testing found as much as 100,000 ppm lead in the soil of the park.&lt;ref name=verd79&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wesolowski|first1=Jerome J.|last2=Flessel|first2=C. Peter|last3=Twiss|first3=Suzanne|last4=Stanley|first4=Ronald L.|last5=Knight|first5=Melton W.|last6=Coleman|first6=Gordon C.|last7=Degarmo|first7=Thomas E.|title=The Identification and Elimination of a Potential Lead Hazard in an Urban Park|journal=Archives of Environmental Health|volume=34|issue=6|year=1979|pages=413–418|issn=0003-9896|doi=10.1080/00039896.1979.10667442}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These removal actions were ineffective at making the park safe, particularly because the protective dome the city installed had not been maintained or checked and had cracked.&lt;ref name=ecy/&gt;  In 1993, the [[African American Development Organization]] lead a drive to force the government to evaluate the safety of the park, after a yellow-white substance had begun to ooze out of cracks in basketball courts in the park.&lt;ref name=ecy/&gt;  Later that same year, the City of Oakland fenced off the park and began testing the area, the EPA was also involved.&lt;ref name=ecy/&gt;&lt;ref name=vcp/&gt; The EPA's evaluation of the site found that soil lead levels as high as 6,700 ppm were still present in the park, as well as zinc levels in excess of 7,450 ppm, and arsenic levels in excess of 700ppm.&lt;ref name=ecy/&gt; The evaluation also found that residential properties within seven blocks of the park also had significantly elevated levels of lead, in some cases as high as 10,000 ppm.&lt;ref name=ecy/&gt;&lt;ref name=vcp/&gt; (84% of houses in the area were built before 1950, and were thus extant while the battery plant was still operational.)&lt;ref name=ecy/&gt; Elevated levels of lead, presumably from the park, were also found at a nearby elementary school.&lt;ref name=ecy/&gt; Although much of the contamination in these areas was likely due to the park, lead paint and leaded gas from nearby highways probably contributed to the contamination as well.&lt;ref name=ecy/&gt; An additional series of actions were taken by joint local, state, and federal agencies between 1993 and 1996 aimed to remediate the park and surrounding residential properties.&lt;ref name=vcp/&gt;  The park reopened in 1996, and cleanup of all nearby residential properties with a soil lead concentration &gt;1000 ppm was performed by AlliedSignal (the owner of the plant, and its final completion was agreed to by the EPA in 2001 in a way that absolved AliedSignal of any future liability.&lt;ref name=ecy/&gt;&lt;ref name=vcp/&gt;

===South Prescott===
South Prescott is a hundred year old neighborhood in West Oakland; due to past industrial activity and leaded gas neighborhood soil averaged 800 ppm lead before a major EPA-led cleanup.&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite news|last=Barringer|first=Felicity|title=To Nullify Lead, Add a Bunch of Fish Bones|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/21/science/earth/21fishbones.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0|accessdate=11 August 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=20 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the most contaminated areas of the neighborhood had soil lead levels in excess of 2700 ppm.&lt;ref name=grist&gt;{{cite news|last=Seltenrich|first=Nate|title=How safe is your soil?|url=http://grist.org/urban-agriculture/2011-08-05-how-safe-is-your-soil/full/|accessdate=11 August 2013|newspaper=Grist|date=5 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The EPA-led cleanup used ground up bones from [[pollock]] to convert elemental lead in the soil to [[pyromorphite]], a compound that is harmless even if it is ingested.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;  The cleanup successfully remediated around 95% of residential properties in South Prescott, as well as all public right-of-ways.&lt;ref name=prescepa&gt;{{cite web|title=West Oakland Lead Cleanup Completed|url=http://www.epaosc.org/sites/5604/files/Fishbone2_13.pdf|publisher=EPA|accessdate=11 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cypress Freeway===
The [[Cypress Street Viaduct]] was an unconventional raised two-tiered portion of the [[Nimitz Freeway]] that ran through a 1.6 mile stretch of Oakland, bordering South Prescott.  The viaduct had been routed through a socio-economically depressed neighborhood originally, and during its construction community groups raised objections that it would destroy an existing vibrant neighborhood, and suggested that a freeway route would not be proposed in a similar way in a wealthier community.  Since leaded gasoline was not banned in the US until 1996, traffic through the original viaduct resulted in neighborhoods surrounding it becoming heavily contaminated with lead.&lt;ref name=asphalt/&gt;

The viaduct was extensively damaged during the [[1989 Loma Prieta earthquake]].  As part of its earthquake relief efforts, the federal government allocated some $700 million to reconstruct the viaduct, with its route shifted somewhat to the west into another pre-existing neighborhood.  A variety of community groups led by the Church of the Living God Faith Tabernacle and the Clean Air Alternative Coalition filed suit against the federal government in 1993 in an effort to require the reconstruction of the viaduct to reposition it in a way that would minimize its effect on the surrounding community, arguing that its suggested placement would have a disproportionate effect on predominately minority communities, including placing a heavy load of lead and other pollutants on them.&lt;ref name=ncr&gt;{{cite news|last=Jones|first=Arthur|title=Put no freeway in my backyard.|newspaper=National Catholic Reporter|date=26 March 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gee&gt;{{cite book|last=Low|first=Nicholas|title=Global ethics and environment|year=1999|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=978-0415197359|edition=1. publ.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lawsuit was not successful, but an out of court settlement did somewhat alter the placement of the reconstructed freeway.&lt;ref name=asphalt&gt;{{cite book|last=Kay|first=Jane Holtz|title=Asphalt nation : how the automobile took over America, and how we can take it back|year=1998|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley, Calif.

==Possible and informal empires==
These governments, confederations and other entities have sometimes been informally referred to as "empires". Some did not fit the modern definition of [[empire]] (e.g. the [[Delian League]]), some were self-proclaimed by their first and often last ruler, others were short-lived attempts to turn an existing government into an empire, and there are also instances of the word "empire" being used to refer to unofficial spheres of influence which do not consider themselves empires.

'''Luciano Petech''' (8 June 1914, [[Trieste]] – 29 September 2010, [[Rome]]) was an Italian scholar of [[Himalayas|Himalayan]] history and the early relations between [[Tibet]], [[Nepal]] and [[Italy]]. He was Chair of History of Eastern Asia at the [[Sapienza University of Rome|University of Rome]] from 1955 to 1984. He is the most renowned of the students of the Italian explorer, academic and Asian scholar [[Giuseppe Tucci]].

Luciano Petech was born in 1914 and retired in 1984. He learned almost all European languages, included [[Latin]], as well as [[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan]], Chinese, [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Nepal Bhasa|Newari]], [[Sanskrit]], [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Standard Hindi|Hindi]] and [[Urdu]].

Lach and van Kley's source is Luciano Petech, "La pretesa ambasciata di Shah Jahan alla Cina", ''Rivista degli studi orientali'',  XXVI (1951), 124-127&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Petech began his teaching career in [[India]] at 25 years old, as a reader in [[Italian language|Italian]] at the [[University of Allahabad]] from 1938 to 1946. His first recorded article is for the ''[[Calcutta Review]]'' in 1939. His subject was the dramas and stories of the great Italian author [[Luigi Pirandello]], who had recently died two years after being awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]]. He says “the people” in Italy had unfairly turned their backs on the intellectual Pirandello as unrepresentative of the times (Petech 1939: 13) and as not speaking to their hearts (idem: 24).

With the outbreak of World War II, as an Italian enemy alien in British India, Petech spent most of that time in a civil [[internment]] camp. Petech used this time to study [[Tibetan literature]] and write an article on the chronological system of the 15th-century [[Blue Annals]] of Tibet. Unlike Tucci, a staunch collaborator with the Fascist regime, Petech was apolitical.

Petech returned to Europe in 1947,to temporary teaching appointments at the [[Naples Eastern University|Istituto Orientale of Naples]] and [[Sapienza University of Rome|University of Rome]]. For the next 8 years, he wrote 30 pieces of varying length on Asia, always focused on the meeting of different cultures from Asia or Europe, in areas bordering India.

From 1955 to 1984, he held the chair of History of Eastern Asia in Rome University, publishing 14 books and over 80 articles on Asia. At the end of this period, the foreword to the anthology of his selected articles, made to mark his retirement, praised his ‘objective, calm and sensible judgment, his willingness to cooperate, and his learning’ (Petech 1988: viii).

These traits are evident in his many works. In his books on Ladakh, Nepal and Tibet from medieval to modern times, his approach has the outward appearance of “history”—unimpeded by philosophy or superstition—unlocked through a serious and critical engagement with historical sources that are described before any of the events described in them.

In his magisterial seven volume ''‘I Missionari Italiani nel Tibet e nel Nepal'', Petech made available a mine of contemporary missionary accounts which are still invaluable source materials. 

Petech’s monographs attempt to bring Himalayan history into the light of world history. This aim was always to be appreciated, and, as [[Herbert Franke (sinologist)|Herbert Franke]] noted in 1950 when Petech published “China and Tibet in the early 18th century”,

It may be considered as a fortunate coincidence... just now when the Chinese government tries to establish again its [[suzerainty]] over the land of snow because it will enable the reader to get a clear notion how the [[Chinese Protectorate|Chinese protectorate]] in Tibet came into being. (Franke 1950)

These are sentiments with which many would thoroughly agree. However, Petech’s early attempts also tend to subsume unique events within western explanatory frameworks. In 1947 he wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
As to [[Ladakh]], there is little to be said. It suffered the fate of all countries which tried to build an empire without that indispensable foundation, a sufficiently large population of the home country. (1988 [1947]: 39)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This attempt to universalise the process of [[empire-building]] also has politically loaded connotations in a time when Italy had just failed to regain the [[Roman Empire]], thwarted by the dwindling imperial powers of Britain and France and the new empire, America.

When he returned to the topic of [[Ladakh]] in 1977, he admitted that ‘I found my first effort hopelessly obsolete’ (1977: xi). His second treatment is more nuanced, and he finally explains the collapse of Ladakhi power with more of an emphasis on economic overstretch (idem: 79).

''Central Tibet and the Mongols'', Petech’s latest book-length study, is a more fluidly written narrative, character-led and more descriptive in tone. It is still authoritative, and has naturally overtaken Tucci’s work on the same period. As [[Elliot Sperling]] wrote in his 1995 review:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
...since the 1949 publication of Giuseppe Tucci’s Tibetan Painted scrolls [and in] the absence of any single monograph dedicated to the public, this last work was often taken by default as the main secondary source on the subject....[While] “Central Tibet and the Mongols” is a relatively short work and leaves a few subjects less than fully explored... [it] is now the basic secondary source to which students of [[Tibet under Yuan rule|Yuan-Tibetan relations]] must turn. (''Journal of the American Oriental Society'' 115.2 (1995): 342–3)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


Petech’s most prominent students are Piero Corradini in East Asian studies and [[Elena De Rossi Filibeck]]  in Tibetan studies.

Luciano Petech died in his home on 19 September 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ladakhstudies.org/news_files/15c579914c67c695306377987d28f3d3-44.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-10-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727012938/http://ladakhstudies.org/news_files/15c579914c67c695306377987d28f3d3-44.html |archivedate=2011-07-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''“Mairzy Doats”''' is a [[novelty song]] written and composed, in 1943, by [[Milton Drake]], [[Al Hoffman]], and [[Jerry Livingston]]. It was first played on radio station [[WOR (AM)|WOR]], New York, by [[Al Trace]] and his Silly Symphonists. The song made the pop charts several times, with a version by [[the Merry Macs]] reaching No. 1 in March 1944. The song was also a number one sheet music seller, with sales of over 450,000 within the first three weeks of release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Smith |first= Kathleen E.R. |date= |title=God Bless America: Tin Pan Alley Goes to War |url= |location= |publisher=The University Press of Kentucky |page=137 |isbn=0-8131-2256-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The song's refrain, as written on the sheet music, seems meaningless:
:''Mairzy doats and dozy doats and liddle lamzy divey''
:''A kiddley divey too, wouldn't you?''&lt;ref name="SheetMusic"&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://digitalcollections.baylor.edu/cdm/ref/collection/fa-spnc/id/104319 |title=Mairzy doats |last=Drake |first=Milton |last2=Hoffman |first2=Al |last3=Livingston |first3=Jerry |publisher=Miller Music Corporation  |year=1943 |location=New York |oclc=876125772  |access-date=2018-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the lyrics of the [[Bridge (music)|bridge]] provide a clue:
:''If the words sound queer and funny to your ear, a little bit jumbled and jivey,''
:''Sing "[[Mare]]s eat [[oat]]s and [[Deer|doe]]s eat oats and little lambs eat ivy."''&lt;ref name="SheetMusic"/&gt;

This hint allows the ear to translate the final line as "a [[Goat|kid]]'ll eat ivy, too; wouldn't you?"

==Meaning==
  
Milton Drake, one of the writers, said the song had been based on an English [[nursery rhyme]]. According  to this story, Drake's four-year-old daughter came home singing, "Cowzy tweet and sowzy tweet and liddle sharksy doisters."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Randall |first=Dale B. J. |year=1995 |title=American "Mairzy" Dottiness, Sir John Fastolf's Secretary, and the "Law French" of a Caroline Cavalier |journal=American Speech |volume=70 |issue=4 |pages=361–370 |doi=10.2307/455617 |jstor=455617 |publisher=Duke University Press }}&lt;/ref&gt; (Cows eat wheat and sows eat wheat and little sharks eat oysters.)

Drake joined Hoffman and Livingston to come up with a tune for the new version of the rhyme, but for a year no one was willing to publish a "silly song."  Finally, Hoffman pitched it to his friend [[Al Trace]], bandleader of the Silly Symphonists. Trace liked the song and recorded it.  It became a huge hit, most notably with the Merry Macs' 1944 recording.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.discogs.com/artist/1193177-The-Merry-Macs&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==

The scholars [[Iona and Peter Opie]] have noted that the last two lines of the song appear in an old [[Catch (music)|catch]] which, when said quickly, appears to be in Latin:&lt;ref name="OpieOpie"&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Oxford Dictionary of Nursery Rhymes |last=Opie |first=Iona |last2=Opie |first2=Peter |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1997 |isbn=978-0198600886 |edition=2nd |page=263}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;poem&gt;In fir tar is,
In oak none is,
In mud eels are,
In clay none are,
Goat eat ivy,
Mare eat oats.&lt;/poem&gt;

They trace the origin of the joke to a manuscript of about 1450 which has "Is gote eate yvy? Mare eate ootys".&lt;ref name="OpieOpie"/&gt;

== Other recordings ==

In 1958, [[New Orleans]] R&amp;B singer [[Tommy Ridgley]] released a rock and roll version of "Mairzy Doats" on the [[Herald Records]] label as a 7" 45 rpm single (number 526).

In 1959, [[Dodie Stevens]] released "Mairzy Doats" as her first recording under [[Dot Records]].

Also in 1959, [[The Mark IV]] released the song as a 7" single on [[Mercury Records]].

[[Bing Crosby]] included the song in a medley on his album ''[[Join Bing and Sing Along ]]'' (1959)

In 1963, an up-tempo [[rock and roll]] version of "Mairzy Doats" was also recorded by [[Carlo Mastrangelo]] of the [[Belmonts]] and released as a 7" record on [[Laurie Records]] the same year.

"Mairzy Doats" received a minor revival in 1967, when it was recorded by The Innocence, who took it to Number 75 on the Pop Top 100 on [[Kama Sutra Records]].

[[Spike Jones]] was among several other artists who covered it, characteristically substituting sound effects for the "food" words. 

Liverpool comedian Arthur Askey sang a version based on local names: "Mersey Docks and Harbour Board/And ferries to New Brighton..."

'''''Mémoires d'Outre-Tombe''''' ({{Lang-fr|'''Memoirs from Beyond the Grave'''}}) is the [[memoir]] of [[François-René de Chateaubriand]] (1768–1848), collected and published posthumously in two volumes in 1849 and 1850, respectively. Chateaubriand was a writer, politician, diplomat, and historian who is regarded as the founder of French [[Romanticism]].

Although the work shares characteristics with earlier French "memoirs" (like the ''Memoirs'' of [[Louis de Rouvroy, duc de Saint-Simon|Saint-Simon]]), the ''Mémoires d'Outre-Tombe'' are also inspired by the ''[[Confessions (Jean-Jacques Rousseau)|Confessions]]'' of [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]: in addition to providing a record of political and historical events, Chateaubriand includes details of his private life and his personal aspirations.

The work abounds in instances of the poetic prose at which Chateaubriand excelled. On the other hand, the melancholy of the autobiography helped establish Chateaubriand as the idol of the young French Romantics; a young [[Victor Hugo]] wrote: "I will be Chateaubriand or nothing."

== Genesis of the work ==
[[Image:Anne-Louis Girodet-Trioson 006.jpg|thumb|''Chateaubriand Meditating on the Ruins of Rome'' (c. 1810s) by [[Anne-Louis Girodet de Roussy-Trioson]]. Oil on canvas.]]
	
It was while in [[Rome]] at the close of 1803 that Chateaubriand decided to write his memoirs; however, he did not begin writing them until 1809, and even then demands from other projects slowed his progress. In 1817 he returned to the memoirs. The first manuscript, probably written while he was serving as ambassador to [[London]], did not reach completion until 1826. At this point, he intended to entitle the book ''Memories of My Life''.

In 1830, however, Chateaubriand decided to change the scope of the work, revising the title to ''Mémoires d'Outre-Tombe'', making a thorough revision of the original text, and writing several new volumes. He divided his life before 1830 into three periods: soldier and traveler, novelist, and statesman. The project had by now become more ambitious; indeed, he tried to reproduce not only his personal exploits, but the epic historical and political events of the era.

==Publication==
After fragmented public readings of his work in [[Salon (gathering)|salon]]s, in 1836 Chateaubriand yielded the rights to his work to a society that published it until his death, paying him accordingly. Having obtained this economic stability, he completed the work with a fourth set of volumes. In 1841 he wrote an ample conclusion.

Chateaubriand originally intended for the work to be published at least fifty years after his death, but his financial troubles forced him, in his words, "to mortgage [his] tomb".

==English translations==
There have been a number of English translations. British author Anthony Kline published a complete translation in 2005 that is freely available for non-commercial use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/MEMOIRESDOUTRETOMBE |title=Memoires D'Outre Tomb |publisher= |author=François de Chateaubriand |year=2005 |page= |accessdate=February 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Chateaubriand/Chathome.php |title=Mémoires d’Outre-Tombe |work=Poetry in Translation |author=Anthony Kline |date=2005 |accessdate=February 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; An abridged translation by Robert Baldick was first published by Alfred A. Knopf in 1961, and later, in paperback, by Penguin books in 1972. A [[New York Review of Books]] edition translated by Alex Andriesse was published in 2018, covering the years 1768-1800 (first 12 of 42 books).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2772">'''Open World''' is a ten-day program which brings emerging leaders from [[Eurasia]] to the [[United States]] to engage with professional counterparts. The program was established in 1999 to foster cultural and political ties with Russia but has since expanded outreach to other countries of the post-Soviet region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Open World Leadership Center|url=https://www.keystonehumanservices.org/global-vision/open-world-leadership-center/|website=Keystone Human Services|accessdate=8 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since its inception the program has brought over 24,000 delegates to 2,300 communities throughout all 50 states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Message from the Executive Director|url=http://openworld.gov/about-us/message-executive-director|website=Open World Leadership Center|accessdate=11 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Program Structure==

Open World provides programming in areas such as Rule of Law, Accountable Governance and Social Services. Delegates have a one-day orientation in [[Washington D.C.]] before travelling to a hosting community. The delegates home-stay with local families and participate in a series of meetings, interviews, presentations, and panel discussions with experts in their fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Open World Program Overview|url=http://www.americancouncils.md/open_world/program_overview|website=American Councils for International Education|accessdate=11 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Open World Leadership Center==
The Open World Leadership Center administers the Open World Program. The agency is part of the U.S. legislative branch and is housed in the [[Library of Congress]] in Washington D.C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Open World Awards Grant to the U.S.-Ukraine Foundation|url=http://www.usukraine.org/openworld.shtml|website=U.S.-Ukraine Foundation|accessdate=11 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Every year, through the Senate and House Subcommittees on Legislative Branch Appropriations, [[U.S. Congress]] decides upon funding for Open World. The agency then confers grants to a variety of national organizations including Rotary clubs and other service organizations, community colleges and universities, sister-city associations, and international visitor councils. 
 
The Open World Leadership Center has a Board of Directors with eleven members. The founding chairman of the Board is [[James H. Billington]], Librarian of Congress. There are three members from the House of Representatives and three members from the Senate. In addition, there are four individuals outside of the government who have an interest in improving relations between Open World’s focus countries and the United States.

'''''Philogelos''''' ({{lang-grc|Φιλόγελως, "Love of Laughter"}}) is the oldest existing collection of [[joke]]s.

The collection is written in Greek, and the language used indicates that it may have been written in the 4th century AD, according to William Berg, an American classics professor.&lt;ref name="DeadParrot"&gt;{{cite news| title = Dead Parrot sketch ancestor found| work = BBC News| publisher = BBC| date = 2008-11-13| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/7725079.stm | accessdate =2008-11-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is attributed to Hierocles and Philagrius, about whom little is known.&lt;ref name=Diatima&gt;{{cite web| last = Quinn| first = John T.| title = 45 Jokes from The Laughter Lover| publisher = Diotima| date = 2001| url = http://www.stoa.org/diotima/anthology/quinn_jokes.shtml | accessdate =2008-11-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the celebration of a thousand [[Founding of Rome|years of Rome]] is mentioned in joke 62, the collection perhaps dates from after that event in 248 AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Jennings| first = Victoria| title = R.D.

The collection contains 265 jokes categorised into subjects such as teachers and scholars, and eggheads and fools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Laes| first = Christian| title = M.

In 2008, British TV personality and comedian [[Jim Bowen]] tested the material on a modern audience.&lt;ref&gt;http://compendopedia.com/2012/11/12/philogelos-the-worlds-oldest-surviving-joke-book/{{Dead link|date=September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the jokes in ''Philogelos ''has been described as "an ancestor of Monty Python's famous Dead Parrot comedy sketch."&lt;ref name="DeadParrot" /&gt; Comedian [[Jimmy Carr]] has said that some of the jokes are "strikingly similar" to modern ones.&lt;ref&gt;http://metro.co.uk/2008/11/13/dead-parrot-sketch-is-1600-years-old-145569/&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Plain of [[Zgharta]]''' (or '''Plain of Zghorta''') is a [[Heavy Neolithic]] archaeological site approximately {{convert|7|km|mi}} east and southeast of [[Tripoli, Lebanon|Tripoli]] in [[Lebanon]]. It has historically been a region known for growing sumptuous [[olives]] owing to early [[Quaternary]], cemented fluvatile deposits that cover the land beneath the topsoil (known as the '''Conglomerates of Zgharta''' or the '''Conglomerates of Zghorta''').&lt;ref name="CopelandWescombe1966"&gt;{{cite book|author1=L.

'''Prajñāpāramitā of Java''' refer to a famous [[murti|depiction]] of [[Boddhisattva]]devi [[Prajnaparamita|Prajñāpāramitā]], originated from 13th century [[Singhasari kingdom|Singhasari]], [[East Java]], Indonesia.&lt;ref name="National Museum"&gt;{{cite web|title=Collectionː Prajnaparamita|publisher=National Museum of Indonesia|url=http://www.museumnasional.or.id/collections/arkeologi/prajnaparamita.html|accessdate=17 May 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20150109125052/http%3A//www.museumnasional.or.id/collections/arkeologi/prajnaparamita.html|archivedate=9 January 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The statue is of great aesthetical and historical value, and is considered as the masterpiece of classical Hindu-[[Buddhist art]] of ancient Java.&lt;ref name ="VCM"&gt;{{cite web|title = Prajnaparamita | publisher =Virtual Collections of Asian Masterpieces| url  =http://masterpieces.asemus.museum/masterpiece/detail.nhn?objectId=12147| accessdate=17 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the statue is one of the prized collection of the [[National Museum of Indonesia]], [[Jakarta]].

==Description==
The statue of Prajnaparamita of East Java is probably the most famous depiction of the goddess of transcendental wisdom. The serene expression and meditative pose and gesture suggest peace and wisdom, in contrast with rich and intricate jewelry and decorations. The goddess is in a perfect lotus meditative position called ''vajrasana'' posture, sitting on a double lotus cushion called ''padmasana'' (lotus pedestal) on top of a square base.&lt;ref name="National Museum"/&gt; The statue sits before a carved stela.

The goddess performs ''dharmachakra-mudra'' (the [[mudra]] symbolizing turning the wheel of dharma).&lt;ref name="National Museum"/&gt; Her left arm is placed around an ''utpala'' (blue lotus), on top of which sits her atrribute; the lontar palm leaf book [[Prajnaparamita Sutra]]. The head and face is perfectly chiseled, with downcast eyes and forehead ''urna''. The goddess wears her hair high arranged in ''Jatamakuta'' crown, and behind her head radiates ''prabhamandala'' a halo or aura of light to suggest a divinity that has reached the highest wisdom.&lt;ref name="Siva Buddha"&gt;{{cite book | title = Worshiping Siva and Buddha: The Temple Art of East Java |author1=Ann R. Kinney |author2=Marijke J. Klokke |author3=Lydia Kieven | publisher = University of Hawaii Press | year =2003 | url = https://books.google.co.id/books?id=sfa2FiIERLYC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;vq=#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |isbn =9780824827793 |accessdate =17 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The statue was discovered in almost perfect condition in the Cungkup Putri ruins near [[Singhasari temple]], [[Malang]], [[East Java]]. Local tradition links the statue to Queen [[Ken Dedes]] the first queen of Singhasari, probably as a deified portrayal of the queen.&lt;ref name="National Museum"/&gt; Another opinion links the statue with Queen [[Gayatri Rajapatni]], the consort of [[Kertarajasa]] the first king of [[Majapahit]].&lt;ref name ="VCM"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author =Drake, Earl| year =2012 |title =Gayatri Rajapatni, Perempuan di Balik Kejayaan Majapahit|publisher = Ombak| location =Yogyakarta}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Prajnaparamita is a goddess of high standing in Mahayana Tantric Buddhism; she is considered the [[shakti]], or consort, of the highest Buddha in the Buddhist pantheon known as [[Vajradhara]]; she symbolises perfect knowledge.&lt;ref name="National Museum"/&gt;

In the 13th century, the tantric Buddhism gained royal patronage of king [[Kertanegara]] of [[Singhasari]], and thereafter some of Prajnaparamita statues were produced in the region, such as the Prajnaparamita of Singhasari in East Java and Prajnaparamita of [[Muaro Jambi Regency|Jambi]], [[Sumatra]]. Both of East Java and Jambi Prajnaparamitas bear resemblance in style as they were produced in same period, however unfortunately Prajnaparamita of Jambi is headless and was discovered in poor condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Arca Prajnaparamitha | publisher = Balai Pelestaria Cagar Budaya Jambi |url = http://kebudayaan.kemdikbud.go.id/bpcbjambi/2014/08/20/arca-prajnaparamitha/| language = Indonesian |accessdate=17 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, the Prajnaparamita of Singhasari was discovered in almost perfect condition. The pristine condition of the statue indicates that it was buried for quite some time. It was found near Candi E, the southernmost structure in the temple complex near [[Singhasari temple]]. The structure is called Candi Wayang or Cungkup Putri by local inhabitants.&lt;ref name="Siva Buddha"/&gt;

The Prajnaparamita of Java was discovered in 1818 or 1819 by D. Monnereau, a [[Dutch East Indies]] official. In 1820 Monnereau gave the statue to C.G.C. Reinwardt, who later brought the statue to the [[Netherlands]], where it became a prized possession of the [[Rijksmuseum voor Volkenkunde]] in [[Leiden]].&lt;ref name ="VCM"/&gt; For more than 158 years the statue was resided in Leiden, the Netherlands.

In January 1978, the Government of the Netherlands returned the statue to the Republic of Indonesia, when [[Queen Juliana of the Netherlands]] visited the former Dutch colony. Today, the statue is placed in [[National Museum of Indonesia]]. The statue is displayed on 2nd floor Gedung Arca, Indonesian National Museum, [[Jakarta]]. It has become perhaps the best known icon of ancient Indonesian art, as one of the rare images that successfully combines aesthetic perfection and spirituality.&lt;ref name ="egregores"&gt;{{cite web|title =Worshipping the Source: The Buddhist Goddess Prajnaparamita | publisher =egregores| url =https://egregores.wordpress.com/2009/09/25/worshipping-the-source-the-buddhist-goddess-prajnaparamita/|accessdate=17 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13211">In the [[philosophy of language]] a '''proper name''', for example the names of persons or places, is a name which is ordinarily taken to uniquely identify its referent in the world. As such it presents particular challenges for [[Meaning (philosophy of language)|theories of meaning]] and it has become a central problem in [[analytical philosophy]].  The common sense view was originally formulated by [[John Stuart Mill]] in ''[[A System of Logic]]'' where he defines it as "a word that answers the purpose of showing what thing it is that we are talking about but not of telling anything about it". This view was criticized when philosophers applied principles of [[formal logic]] to linguistic propositions. [[Gottlob Frege]] pointed out that proper names may apply to imaginary and inexistent entities without becoming meaningless, and he showed that sometimes more than one proper name may identify the same entity without having the same ''sense'', so that the phrase "Homer believed the morning star was the evening star" could be meaningful and not tautological in spite of the fact that the morning star and the evening star identifies the same referent. This example became known as [[Frege's Puzzle]] and is a central issue in the theory of proper names.

[[Bertrand Russell]] was the first to propose a [[Descriptivist theory of names]], which held that a proper name refers not to a referent, but to a set of true propositions that uniquely describe a referent - for example "Aristotle" refers to "the teacher of Alexander the Great". Rejecting descriptivism [[Saul Kripke]] and [[Keith Donnellan]] instead advanced [[causal theory of reference|causal-historical theories of reference]] which hold that names come to be associated with individual referents because social groups who links the name to its reference in a naming event (e.g. a baptism) which henceforth fixes the value of the name to the specific referent within that community. Today a [[direct reference theory]] is common, which holds that proper names refer to their referents without attributing any additional information, connotative or of sense, about them.&lt;ref name=Stanford&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/names/#2.1 Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy - Names]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The problem==
The problem of proper names arise within a theory of meaning that is based on truth values and propositional logic, when trying to ascertain the criteria with which to determine if propositions that include proper names are true or false.

For example, in the proposition ''Cicero is Roman'' it is unclear what semantic content the proper name ''Cicero'' provides to the proposition. One may intuitively assume that the name refers to a person who may or may not be Roman, and that the truth value depends on whether that is the case or not. But from the point of view of a theory of meaning the question is ''how'' the word Cicero establishes its referent.

Another problem known as [[Frege's Puzzle]], asks why it can be the case that the two names can refer to the same referent, yet not necessarily be considered entirely synonymous. His example is that the proposition "Hesperus is Hesperus" (Hesperus being the Greek name of the morning star) is tautological and vacuous while the proposition "Hesperus is Phosphorus" (Phosphorus being the Greek name of the evening star) conveys information. This puzzle suggests that there is something more to the meaning of the proper name than simply pointing out its referent.

== Theories ==
Many theories have been proposed about proper names, each attempting to solve the problems of reference and identity inherent in the concept.

===Millian theory===
John Stuart Mill distinguished between [[connotation|connotative]] and [[denotation|denotative]] meaning, and argued that proper names included no other semantic content to a proposition than identifying the referent of the name and were hence purely denotative.&lt;ref name=Stanford/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Katz, J. J. (2001). The end of Millianism: multiple bearers, improper names, and compositional meaning. The Journal of philosophy, 137-166.&lt;/ref&gt; Some contemporary proponents of a Millian theory of naming argue that the process through which something becomes a proper name is exactly the gradual loss of connotation for pure denotation - such as the process that turned the descriptive propositions "long island" into the proper name [[Long Island]].&lt;ref&gt;Coates, R. (2009). A strictly Millian approach to the definition of the proper name. Mind &amp; Language, 24(4), 433-444.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sense based theory of names===
[[Gotlob Frege|Frege]] argued that one had to distinguish between the [[Sense and reference|sense]] (''Sinn'') and the reference of the name. And that different names for the same entity might identify the same referent without being formally synonymous. For example, although the Morning star and the evening star is the same astronomical object, the proposition "the morning star is the evening star" is not a [[tautology (grammar)|tautology]] but provides actual information to someone who did not know this. Hence to Frege the two names for the object must have a different sense.&lt;ref&gt;Frege, Gottlob. On Sense and Reference. In P. Geach, M. Black, eds. ''Translations from the Philosophical Writings of Gottlob Frege.'' Oxford: Blackwell. 1952.&lt;/ref&gt; Philosophers such as [[John McDowell]] have elaborated on Frege's theory of proper names.&lt;ref&gt;McDowell,J. 1977: 'On the sense and reference of a proper name'. Mind, 86, 159-85.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Descriptive theory ===
{{Main|Descriptivist theory of names}}
{{Quote box |width=300px |align=right |quoted=true |
|salign=right
|quote="The only kind of word that is theoretically capable of standing for a particular is a proper name, and the whole matter of proper names is rather curious."

}}
The ''descriptive'' theory of proper names is the view that the meaning of a given use of a proper name is a set of properties that can be expressed as a [[definite description|description]] that picks out an object that satisfies the description.  
[[Bertrand Russell]]  espoused such a view arguing that the name refers to a description, and that description, like a definition, ''picks out'' the bearer of the name.&lt;ref name=Stanford/&gt;  The description then functions as an abbreviation or a truncated form of the description. The distinction between the embedded description and the bearer itself is similar to that between the ''extension'' and the ''intension'' (Frege's terms) of a general term, or between [[Connotation (semiotics)|connotation]] and [[denotation]] (Mill's terms).

[[John Searle]] elaborated Russell's theory suggesting that the proper name refers to a cluster of propositions that in combination pick out a unique referent. This was meant to deal with the objection by some critics of Russell's theory that a descriptive theory of meaning would make the referent of a name dependent on the knowledge that the person saying the name has about the referent.&lt;ref name=Stanford/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Searle, J. R. (1958). II.—PROPER NAMES. Mind, 67(266), 166-173.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1973, [[Tyler Burge]] proposed a metalinguistic descriptivist theory of proper names which holds that names have the meaning that corresponds to the description of the individual entities to whom the name is applied.&lt;ref&gt;Burge, T. (1973). Reference and proper names. The Journal of Philosophy, 425-439.&lt;/ref&gt; This however opens up for the possibility that names are not proper, when for example more than one person shares the same name. This leads Burge to argue that plural usages of names, such as "all the Alfreds I know have red hair", support this view.&lt;ref name=Stanford/&gt;

=== Causal theory of names ===
{{main|Causal theory of reference}}
The [[causal theory of names|causal-historical theory]] originated by Saul Kripke in ''[[Naming and Necessity]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Kripke, Saul. ''Naming and Necessity.'' Basil Blackwell. Boston. 1980.&lt;/ref&gt; building on work by among others [[Keith Donnellan]],&lt;ref&gt;Donnellan, K. S. (1970). Proper names and identifying descriptions. Synthese, 21(3-4), 335-358.&lt;/ref&gt; combines the referential view with the idea that the name's referent is fixed by a baptismal act, whereupon the name becomes a [[rigid designation|rigid designator]] of the referent. Kripke did not emphasize causality, but rather the historical relation between the naming event and the [[speech community|community of speakers]] within which it circulates, but in spite of this the theory is often called "a causal theory of naming".&lt;ref&gt;Robert Audi. 2015. The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy. Cambridge University Press, pp.&lt;/ref&gt;

The pragmatic naming theory of [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] is sometimes considered a precursor of causal-historical naming theory. He described proper names in the following terms: "A proper name, when one meets with it for the first time, is existentially connected with some percept or other equivalent individual knowledge of the individual it names. It is then, and then only, a genuine Index. The next time one meets with it, one regards it as an Icon of that Index. The habitual acquaintance with it having been acquired, it becomes a Symbol whose Interpretant represents it as an Icon of an Index of the Individual named." Here he notes out that the baptismal event takes place for each person when a proper name is first associated with a referent (for example by pointing and saying "this is John", establishing an [[indexicality|indexical relation]] between the name and the person) who is henceforth considered to be a conventional ("symbolic" in Peircean terms) references to the referent.&lt;ref&gt;Pietarinen, A. V. (2007). Peirce on Proper Names. Psychology, 1, 127.&lt;/ref&gt; [ "who is...a conventional....references to the referent" is grammatically incorrect, rendering the whole sentence incoherent]

===Direct reference theories===
{{main|Direct reference theory}}
Rejecting sense-based, descriptivist and causal-historical theories of naming, theories of direct reference hold that names together with demonstratives are a class of words that refer directly to their referent.&lt;ref&gt;Hale, B., &amp; Wright, C. (Eds.). (1997). A Companion to the Philosophy of Language (p. 660). Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Devitt, M., &amp; Hanley, R. (Eds.). (2008). The Blackwell guide to the philosophy of language. John Wiley &amp; Sons. p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''[[Tractatus Logico Philosophicus]]'' [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] also held a direct reference position, arguing that names refer to a particular directly, and that this referent is its only meaning.&lt;ref name=Blackwell/&gt; In his later work however he has been attributed a cluster-descriptivist position based on the idea of [[family resemblance]]s (for example by Kripke), although it has been argued that this misconstrues Wittgenstein's argument.&lt;ref&gt;Boersema, D. B. (2000). Wittgenstein on Names. Essays in Philosophy, 1(2), 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Particularly his later view has been compared to that of Kripke's own view which recognizes names as stemming from a social convention and pragmatic principles of understanding others utterances.&lt;ref&gt;Cappio, J. (1981). Wittgenstein on proper names or: Under the circumstances. Philosophical Studies, 39(1), 87-105.&lt;/ref&gt;

Direct reference theory is similar to Mill's theory in that it proposes that the only meaning of a proper name is its referent. Modern proposals such as those by [[David Kaplan (philosopher)|David Kaplan]], which distinguish between Fregean and non-Fregean terms, the former which have both sense and reference and the latter which include proper names and have only reference.&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan, David. 1979: On the logic of demonstratives. Journal of Philosophical Logic, 8, 81-98.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Continental philosophy===
Outside of the analytic tradition few [[Continental philosophy|continental philosophers]] have approached the proper name as a philosophical problem. In ''[[Of Grammatology]]'' [[Jacques Derrida]] specifically refutes the idea that proper names stand outside of the social construct of language as a binary relation between referent and sign. Rather he argues, the proper name as all words are caught up in a context of social, spatial and temporal differences that make it meaningful. He also notes that there are subjective elements of meaning in proper names, since they connect the bearer of a name with the sign of their own identity.&lt;ref&gt;Barry Stocker. 2006. Routledge Philosophy Guidebook to Derrida on Deconstruction. Routledge,  2006 pp. 50-58&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Semonides of [[Amorgos]]''' ({{IPAc-en|s|ɪ|ˈ|m|ɒ|n|ɪ|ˌ|d|iː|z}}; {{lang-grc-gre|Σημωνίδης ὁ Ἀμοργῖνος}}, variantly {{lang|grc|Σιμωνίδης}}; fl. 7th century BC) was a [[Greeks|Greek]] [[Iambus (genre)|iambic]] and [[elegiac couplet|elegiac]] poet who is believed to have lived during the seventh century BC. Fragments of his poetry survive as quotations in other ancient authors, the most extensive and well known of which is a [[Types of Women|satiric account of different types of women]] which is often cited in discussions of [[misogyny]] in [[Archaic Greece]]. The poem takes the form of a catalogue, with each type of woman represented by an animal whose characteristics—in the poet's scheme—are also characteristic of a large body of the female population. Other fragments belong to the registers of [[gnomic poetry]] and [[wisdom literature]] in which the [[Hesiodic]] ''[[Works and Days]]'' and the ''[[Theognidea]]'' are classed, and reflect a similarly pessimistic view of the human experience. There is also evidence that Semonides composed the sort of personal invective found in the work of his near contemporary iambographer [[Archilochus]] and the later [[Hipponax]], but no surviving fragment can be securely attributed to such a poem.

==Name and biography==
The name "Semonides" ({{lang|grc|Σημωνίδης}}, ''Sēmōnídes'') is attested by an entry transmitted in two ancient lexica—the ''[[Etymologicum Genuinum]]'' and ''[[Etymologicum Magnum]]''—which apparently had [[Choeroboscus]] as its immediate source:

{{col-begin}}
{{col-break}}
{{lang|grc|Σιμωνίδης. ἐπὶ μὲν τοῦ ἰαμβοποιοῦ διὰ τοῦ η γράφεται, καὶ ἴσως παρὰ τὸ σῆμα ἐστί· τὸ δὲ ἐπὶ τοῦ λυρικοῦ, διὰ τοῦ ι, καὶ ἴσως παρὰ τὸ σιμὸς ἐστί. Χοιροβοσκός.}}
{{col-break}}
Simonides: in the case of the iambic poet is written with an [[eta]], as in "sign" (''sēma''); the name of the lyric poet is written with an [[iota]], as in "snub-nosed" (''sīmos''). —&amp;nbsp;Choeroboscus&lt;ref&gt;The entry is identical in the ''[[Etymologicum Genuinum|Et. Gen.]]'' and ''[[Etymologicum Magnum|Et. Mag.]]'', save for the attribution to Choeroboscus which is only found in the latter ({{harvtxt|West|1992|p=98}}).&lt;/ref&gt;
{{col-end}}

The lyric poet mentioned herein is [[Simonides of Ceos]] (6th–5th centuries BC). Despite the testimony of the etymologica, every source that quotes the iambic poet spells his name identically with that of his more famous namesake,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Barron|Easterling|Knox|1985|p=153 n. 1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and the only other author who uses the form "Semonides" is [[Philodemus]].&lt;ref&gt;Philodemus, ''On Poems'', quoted by {{harvtxt|Asmis|1995|pp=172–3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Whatever the poet's name actually was, modern scholarship has adopted Choeroboscus' distinction between the two forms as a means of distinguishing the two poets.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Campbell|1982|p=184}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Still, the homophony of their names in ancient quotations leaves open the possibility that some fragments attributed to Simonides might actually belong to Semonides.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Barron|Easterling|Knox|1985|pp=153–4}}; cf. {{harvtxt|West|1992|p=114}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two notices in the tenth-century encyclopedia known as the ''[[Suda]]'' provide most of the extant details of Semonides' life. His primary lemma reads: "Simonides [sic], son of Crines, of [[Amorgos]], iambic writer. He wrote elegiac poetry in two books and iambics. He was born (or 'flourished': {{lang|grc|γέγονε}}) 490 years after the [[Trojan War]] [i.e. 693 BC]. He was the first to write iambics according to some."&lt;ref&gt;''Suda'' s.v. [http://www.stoa.org/sol-bin/search.pl?db=REAL&amp;search_method=QUERY&amp;login=guest&amp;enlogin=guest&amp;user_list=LIST&amp;page_num=1&amp;searchstr=sigma,446&amp;field=adlerhw_gr&amp;num_per_page=1 {{lang|grc|Σιμωνίδης (Σ}} 446)], trans. {{harvtxt|Campbell|1982|pp=183–4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Further information has been conflated with the entry on [[Simmias of Rhodes]]; the relevant portion is:
{{quote|He was originally a Samian, but in the colonisation of Amorgos he was sent as leader by the Samians.  He founded Amorgos in three cities, Minoa, Aegialus and Arcesime. He was born (or "flourished") 406 years after the Trojan War [i.e. 777 BC]. According to some he was the first writer of iambics, and wrote various other things including an ''Early History of Samos''.&lt;ref&gt;''Suda'' s.v. [http://www.stoa.org/sol-bin/search.pl?db=REAL&amp;search_method=QUERY&amp;login=guest&amp;enlogin=guest&amp;user_list=LIST&amp;page_num=1&amp;searchstr=sigma,431&amp;field=adlerhw_gr&amp;num_per_page=1 {{lang|grc|Σιμμίας (Σ}} 431)], trans. after {{harvtxt|Campbell|1982|p=184}}. One manuscript of gives the year of Semonides' floruit as 490 years after the Trojan War, matching the entry quoted above ({{harvtxt|West|1992|p=99}}).&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Other contradictory dates for Semonides' birth or [[floruit]] are found in the chronographic tradition relying upon [[Eusebius]]' ''[[Chronicon (Eusebius)|Chronicon]]'' ([[Olympiad]] 29.1&amp;nbsp;= 664 BC), [[Cyril of Alexandria]] (29th Olympiad&amp;nbsp;= 664–661), and [[Clement of Alexandria]] (20th Olympiad&amp;nbsp;= 700–697).&lt;ref&gt;The Eusebian date is found in [[Jerome]]'s [[Chronicon (Jerome)|translation]], the Armenian text of Eusebius gives the year 665; Cyril, ''Contra Iulianum'' 1.14; Clement, ''[[Stromata]]'' 1.21.131.&lt;/ref&gt; Semonides' role in the colonisation of Amorgos and his identification as a contemporary of [[Archilochus]] in the ancient testimonia recommend accepting the later dates of Eusebius and Cyril, and today he is almost universally considered to have lived in the middle and latter half of the seventh century.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|West|1996}}, {{harvtxt|Bowie|2008}}, {{harvtxt|Campblell|1982|p=184}}, {{harvtxt|Barron|Easterling|Knox|p=154}}. {{harvtxt|Hubbard|1994}} believes that the ancient testimonia represent pure conjecture and argues that Semonides lived in the late sixth century on the basis of what he perceives as modish (relatively speaking) thought in a passage of Semonides fr. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Based upon a perceived allusion to Archilochus at Semonides {{abbr|fr.|fragment}} 7.51–2 some have refined the chronology further, arguing that Semonides either lived after Archilochus or was his younger contemporary.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. {{harvtxt|Campbell|1982|p=184}}.&lt;/ref&gt; If the ''Suda''{{'}}s testimony that Semonides participated in the [[Colonies in antiquity|colonization]] of Amorgos is true, he likely had a political career similar to that of Archilochus, who was among the colonists of [[Thasos]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Campbell|1982|p=184}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Poetry==
Although the ''Suda'' states that Semonides composed elegy as well iambus, none of his elegiac poetry has survived.&lt;ref&gt;An elegiac quotation in [[Stobaeus]] was formerly attributed to Semonides by some (e.g. {{harvtxt|Campbell|1982|pp=184, 191}}), but is now known to be the work of [[Simonides]] by virtue of its overlapping the text of a [[papyrus]] fragment securely assigned to that poet. The text now stands as Simonides frr. 19 and 20.5–12 in [[#{{harvid|West|1992}}|West's edition]]; cf. {{harvtxt|Bowie|2008}}. {{harvtxt|Hubbard|1996}} alone has continued to argue that, despite the papyrological evidence, this fragment is the work of Semonides.&lt;/ref&gt; If the encyclopedia's information is to be trusted, it is probable that the first entry's "elegiac poetry in two books" refers to the ''Early History of Samos'' in the second.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Bowie|1986|p=31}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This work would belong to the genre of ''ktisis'' ("foundation") poetry which [[Mimnermus]]' elegiac ''Smyrneis'' might also have represented.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Bowie|1986|pp=28 n. 78, 31}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Semonides' poetry, as is the case with archaic elegy and iambus in general, is composed in a literary [[Ionic dialect]] largely reminiscent of [[Homeric Greek]] and occasionally includes echoes of [[Homeric]] and [[Hesiodic]] poetry.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Campbell|1982|p=184}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The extant fragments are written in [[iambic trimeter]]s, a [[stichic]] verse form also employed by Archilochus which would later be the primary meter of dialogue in [[Greek tragedy|tragedy]]. To judge from the admittedly small sample of his work, Semonides was a conservative metrician: in 180 lines there is not a single certain instance of [[resolution (meter)|resolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|West|1983|p=41}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Archaeology Discover Centre formerly '''Sunken Secrets''', formerly the '''Underwater Archaeology Centre''' is a [[museum]] located in [[Fort Victoria (Isle of Wight)|Fort Victoria]] on the [[Isle of Wight]], [[England]].

The museum is run by archaeologists based on the Isle of Wight.  It is housed in five of the fort's former [[casemate]]s. Since it was opened in 1990 the museum has been used to display exhibits recovered from several local [[shipwreck]]s and the submerged landscapes of the [[Solent]]. These include the wrecks of [[HMS Pomone (1805)|HMS ''Pomone'']], [[HMS Invincible (1747)|HMS ''Invincible'']], the [[Yarmouth Roads Wreck]] and [[Bouldnor Cliff]].  The museum also houses an exhibition about the history of Fort Victoria itself.

Like most attractions in the fort the museum only operates from Easter to autumn, during which time it opens daily and occasionally holds activity and community events which are advertised at the fort, on Twitter and in local press.

==History==
After the wreck of [[HMS Pomone (1805)|HMS ''Pomone'']] was discovered at [[The Needles]] in 1969, the [[Isle of Wight Council]] funded a team to research and excavate the site.&lt;ref name=M52&gt;Medland, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1984 another wreck was discovered immediately offshore of [[Yarmouth, Isle of Wight|Yarmouth]] and work began excavating that site as well.&lt;ref name=M52/&gt; In 1990 the Isle of Wight Trust for Maritime Archaeology was founded and began operating a museum at [[Fort Victoria (Isle of Wight)|Fort Victoria]] called the '''Maritime Heritage Exhibition'''. Several finds from the excavations were displayed in the museum, whilst others went to the [[Royal Naval Museum]] in Portsmouth and [[Bembridge Maritime Museum]].&lt;ref name=M52/&gt;

In 1991 the Trust expanded into the [[Hampshire and Wight Trust for Maritime Archaeology]], a charity which went on to investigate more maritime archaeology in the local area and discovered the site of [[Bouldnor Cliff]] in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/hampshire/6928293.stm|title=Fight on to save Stone Age Atlantis|publisher=BBC| date=2007-08-08|accessdate=2010-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Trust refurbished the museum which was re-opened in 2006 as the Underwater Archaeology Centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite sign|title=The Underwater Archaeology Centre|url= |date=2006|medium=Plaque outside museum|publisher=The Hampshire and Wight Trust for Maritime Archaeology|location=[[Fort Victoria (Isle of Wight)|Fort Victoria]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 it was renamed Sunken Secrets. In 2017 the ownership of the centre passed into local hands.

==Exhibits==
'''Shipwrecks''': The shipwrecks exhibition explores why there are so many wrecks in the Solent area, why wrecks are seen as acting as time capsules of the past, and displays finds from Trust excavations.&lt;ref name=B113&gt;Burdett &amp; Insole, p 113&lt;/ref&gt; It includes the stories of HMS ''Pomone'', HMS ''Invincible'', the [[Yarmouth Roads Wreck]] (believed to be the Spanish Galleon ''Santa Lucia''),&lt;ref name=M52/&gt; and other wrecks at the Needles and [[Alum Bay]].&lt;ref name=SS&gt;{{cite web |title= Sunken Secrets - Current Exhibitions|url=http://sunkensecrets.hwtma.org.uk/currentexhibitions |publisher= Maritime Archaeology Trust|accessdate=2013-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Submerged landscapes''': The submerged landscapes exhibits explain the history of the Solent as a dry river valley before rising sea levels flooded it and created the [[strait]] that exists today.&lt;ref name=B113/&gt; It focuses on the Trust's excavations at Bouldnor Cliff and includes artefacts recovered from the sea bed.&lt;ref name=SS/&gt;

'''History of Fort Victoria''': Fort Victoria does not have a museum of its own, but an exhibition within Sunken Secrets details its history and its role in the defence of the [[Needles Passage]].&lt;ref name=SS/&gt;

The museum also contains information about the actual practice of maritime archaeology.&lt;ref name=SS/&gt;

'''''{{lang|de|Süddeutsche Monatshefte}}''''' ("South German Monthly", also credited as ''{{lang|de|Süddeutscher Monatshefte}}'') was a German magazine published in [[Munich]] between January 1904 and September 1936. After beginnings as an art and literary venue, liberal but highly critical of [[modernism]], it made a turn toward politics before World War I. Especially supportive of [[Conservatism in Germany|German conservatism]], it was also sympathetic toward ''[[Völkisch movement|Völkisch]]'' ideologists, and published propaganda in favor of militarist politicians such as [[Alfred von Tirpitz]]. Having for its founder and editor [[Paul Nikolaus Cossmann]], an [[Jewish assimilation|assimilated Jew]], ''{{lang|de|Süddeutsche Monatshefte}}'' was generally [[Antisemitism|antisemitic]]—strongly so after 1920, when it hosted calls for [[racial segregation]].

Its publication of conspiracy theories such as the [[stab-in-the-back myth]] paved the way for [[Nazi propaganda]], but ''{{lang|de|Süddeutsche Monatshefte}}'' was more closely aligned with the mainstream right. It played a part in conspiratorial alliances supporting the policies of [[Gustav Ritter von Kahr|Gustav von Kahr]], although it also had [[Conservative Revolutionary movement|Conservative Revolutionaries]] among its core contributors. In its late years, ''{{lang|de|Süddeutsche Monatshefte}}'' turned to [[Bavarian nationalism]] and [[House of Wittelsbach|Wittelsbach loyalism]], becoming a target for the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi regime]]. Cossmann was imprisoned for dissidence, then deported for his Jewishness; {{Interlanguage link multi|Leo Hausleiter|de}} took over, leading ''{{lang|de|Süddeutsche Monatshefte}}'' until its disestablishment in 1936.

==Beginnings==
Established as a mainly [[Social liberalism|social-liberal]] tribune by Cossmann, a Jewish writer who had converted to Catholicism, ''{{lang|de|Süddeutsche Monatshefte}}'' initially sought to reaffirm the cultural importance of [[Southern Germany]] and solidify its symbiotic relationship with [[Prussia]], creating cultural bridges between Catholics and Protestants.&lt;ref&gt;Alexandre, pp. 195–196, 210–212&lt;/ref&gt; Joining the directorial staff in the first edition was liberal pastor-politician [[Friedrich Naumann]] (its political director to 1913),&lt;ref&gt;Alexandre, p. 196, 199–200, 210–212&lt;/ref&gt; who shared editorial oversight with painter [[Hans Thoma]] and composer [[Hans Pfitzner]].&lt;ref name="chr.all"&gt;"Chronique allemande", ''Bibliothèque Universelle et Revue Suisse'', Vol. 39, Issue 115, pp. 635–636&lt;/ref&gt; Protestant social reformer {{Interlanguage link multi|Martin Rade|de}} and [[Joseph Schnitzer]], a [[Modernism (Roman Catholicism)|Modernist Catholic]], were noted guest writers, with Cossmann acting as neutral host.&lt;ref&gt;Alexandre, pp. 196–198&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[German federal election, 1907|federal election of 1907]], the magazine hosted debates between Schnitzer and [[Centre Party (Germany)|Center Party]] militant {{Interlanguage link multi|Martin Spahn|de}}, on [[Political Catholicism]] and its role in society (a divisive one, according to Schnitzer).&lt;ref&gt;Alexandre, p. 206&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to historian Adam R. Seipp, ''{{lang|de|Süddeutsche Monatshefte}}'' was mainly an interface for traditional Munich—Catholic, "deeply conservative", "suspicious of outside influences", and antithetical to the modernist ''[[Simplicissimus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Adam R. Seipp, ''The Ordeal of Peace: Demobilization and the Urban Experience in Britain and Germany, 1917–1921'', p. 39. Farnham: [[Ashgate Publishing]], 2009.  {{ISBN|978-0-7546-6749-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cossmann managed to attract important writers to the magazine's permanent staff, including {{Interlanguage link multi|Josef Hofmiller|de}} and [[Karl Alexander von Müller (historian)|Karl Alexander von Müller]].&lt;ref name="hchk"/&gt; In its early issues, ''{{lang|de|Süddeutsche Monatshefte}}'' hosted mainly essays by the likes of Hofmiller (such as his 1909 putdown of the modernist author [[Robert Walser (writer)|Robert Walser]]),&lt;ref&gt;Bernhard F. Malkmus, ''The German Picaro and Modernity: Between Underdog and Shape-shifter'', p. 65. New York: [[Continuum International Publishing Group]], 2011.  {{ISBN|978-1-4411-9723-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Carl Spitteler]], and {{Interlanguage link multi|Karl Voll|de}}, and poetry by {{Interlanguage link multi|Paul Ilg|de}}.&lt;ref name="chr.all"/&gt;

Some of the cultural and social chronicles had nationalist undertones, debating over the requirements of German modernization. As [[Anglophilia|Anglophiles]], Hofmiller, [[Lujo Brentano]], and {{Interlanguage link multi|Theodor Vogelstein|de}} suggested fusing Anglo–American lessons in modernity with the German ''[[Volkstum]]'', to make Germany a more competitive capitalist nation; in 1906, a Dr. Paul Tesdorf went further, promoting [[eugenics]] as a means to engineer a better people.&lt;ref&gt;Alexandre, pp. 197–198, 200–202&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, Naumann and other authors worried about [[finance capitalism]] and [[Oligopoly|oligopolies]], exhorting a German nationalism based on "[[democratic capitalism]]" or [[syndicalism]], and following closely the development of [[Revisionism (Marxism)|Marxist revisionism]].&lt;ref&gt;Alexandre, pp. 202–204. See also Struve, p. 90&lt;/ref&gt; In a February 1906 obituary for the "legal socialist" [[Anton Menger]], [[Eugen Ehrlich]] commented that the term "socialism" had virtually lost its mystique.&lt;ref&gt;Thilo Ram, "Juristensozialismus in Deutschland", in ''Quaderni Fiorentini per la Storia del Pensiero Giuridico Moderno'', Vols. 3–4 ("Il 'Socialismo giuridico': ipotesi e letture. I"), 1974–1975, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

The magazine took a distinctly liberal position on education reform, with Rade supporting the [[Wissenschaft des Judentums|Jewish studies movement]].&lt;ref&gt;Christian Wiese, "'The Best Antidote to Anti-Semitism'? ''Wissenschaft des Judentums'', Protestant Biblical Scholarship, and Anti-Semitism in Germany before 1933", in [[Andreas Gotzmann]], Christian Wiese (eds.), ''Modern Judaism and Historical Consciousness: Identities, Encounters, Perspectives'', pp. 153–154. Leiden: [[Brill Publishers]], 2007.  {{ISBN|978-90-04-15289-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the contributors, in particular [[Gustav Wyneken]], were critics of the [[Herbartianism|Herbartian educational tradition]]; Wyneken's polemics with the more conservative [[Friedrich Wilhelm Foerster]] were taken up by ''{{lang|de|Süddeutsche Monatshefte}}''.&lt;ref&gt;Alexandre, pp. 207–208&lt;/ref&gt; In 1909, the journal was also one of the first to host [[Hans Driesch]]'s philosophical tracts, discussing the concept of [[Becoming (philosophy)|becoming]] in history and nature.&lt;ref&gt;Caterina Zanfi, ''Bergson e la filosofia tedesca, 1907–1932'', p. 151. Macerata: Quodlibet, 2013.  {{ISBN|978-88-7462-549-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1913, it aired [[Moritz Geiger]]'s grievances against [[experimental psychology]], implicitly a defense of classical [[Phenomenology (psychology)|phenomenology]].&lt;ref&gt;Martin Kusch, ''Psychologism. A Case Study in the Sociology of Philosophical Knowledge'', p. 195. London: [[Routledge]], 1995.  {{ISBN|0-415-12555-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Debates about innovation were carried into the artistic realm. An early contributor, [[Henry Thode]], wrote articles which censured [[modern art]] from conservative and antisemitic positions, attacking modernist critics such as [[Julius Meier-Graefe]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas W. Gaehtgens]], "Les rapports de l'histoire de l'art et de l'art contemporain en Allemagne à l'époque de Wölfflin et de Meier-Graefe", ''Revue de l'Art'', Vol. 88, 1990, pp. 35, 38&lt;/ref&gt; In 1911, the debate was taken further: ''{{lang|de|Süddeutsche Monatshefte}}'' hosted both {{Interlanguage link multi|Carl Vinnen|de}}'s manifesto against French "invasion" in German art, as well as the more cautious, pro-modernist, replies to Vinnen, from: Thoma, [[Lovis Corinth]], [[Gustav Klimt]], [[Max Klinger]], [[Max Slevogt]], [[Leopold Graf von Kalckreuth|Count Kalckreuth]], [[Wilhelm Trübner]], and [[Auguste Rodin]].&lt;ref&gt;"Revue des revues. ''Süddeutsche Monatshefte''", ''La Chronique des Arts et de la Curiosité. Supplément à la Gazette des Beaux-arts'', No. 23/1911, p. 182&lt;/ref&gt; In various other issues, ''{{lang|de|Süddeutsche Monatshefte}}'' carried polemical essays by [[Aestheticism|aestheticists]] such as {{Interlanguage link multi|Rudolf Borchardt|de}}&lt;ref&gt;[[Heinz Politzer]], "[https://www.commentarymagazine.com/article/rudolf-borchardt-poet-of-assimilationthe-extreme-case-of-an-extreme-tendency/ Rudolf Borchardt, Poet of Assimilation. The Extreme Case of an Extreme Tendency]", in ''[[Commentary (magazine)|Commentary]]'', January 1950&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Paul Zarifopol]].&lt;ref&gt;Aurel Sasu (ed.), ''Dicționarul biografic al literaturii române'', Vol. II, p. 868. Pitești: [[Editura Paralela 45]], 2004.  {{ISBN|973-697-758-7}}; [[Paul Zarifopol]], "Tehnica artistică și cealaltă tehnică", ''[[Viața Românească]]'', Nr. 7–8/1930, pp. 3–4&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wartime and revolution==
In January 1913, ''{{lang|de|Süddeutsche Monatshefte}}'' made official its doctrinal links with anti-democratic conservatism: [[Robert von Pöhlmann]] published an article condemning [[majoritarianism]], demanding instead the remodeling of Germany into a ''{{lang|de|Kulturstaat}}'' ("civilization-state"), with a politically-enshrined [[social stratification]]. Naumann resigned in protest against veiled accusations him in Pöhlmann's article, but also because the magazine had discarded [[liberal democracy]].&lt;ref&gt;Alexandre, pp. 211–212&lt;/ref&gt;

''{{lang|de|Süddeutsche Monatshefte}}'' saluted the [[July Crisis|July 1914 Crisis]] and the outbreak of World War I: in the September issue, [[Karl Mayr]] wrote that the war signified "internal transformation".&lt;ref&gt;Verhey, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; The magazine's nationalism became extreme over the following months, with Cossmann arguing in favor of ''{{lang|de|Siegfriede}}'' ("victory peace")&lt;ref name="wjc107"&gt;Cahnman, p. 107&lt;/ref&gt; and Müller celebrating Prussia as a "heroic-aristocratic warrior state";&lt;ref&gt;[[John C. G. Röhl]], "Hof und Hofgesellschaft unter Kaiser Wilhelm II.", in ''Pariser Historische Studien'', Vol. 21, 1985, p. 257&lt;/ref&gt; similarly, [[Hermann Oncken]] and [[Friedrich Meinecke]] wrote praises of militarism and [[Prussian virtues]].&lt;ref&gt;Christoph Cornelißen, "Politische Historiker und deutsche Kultur. Die Schriften und Reden von Georg v. Below, Hermann Oncken und Gerhard Ritter im Ersten Weltkrieg", in [[Wolfgang Mommsen]], Elisabeth Müller-Luckner (eds.), ''Kultur und Krieg: Die Rolle der Intellektuellen, Künstler und Schriftsteller im Ersten Weltkrieg (Schriften des Historischen Kollegs. Herausgegeben von der Stiftung Historisches Kolleg. Kolloquien 34)'', pp. 119, 136. Munich: R. Oldenbourg Verlag, 1996.  {{ISBN|3-486-56085-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''{{lang|de|Süddeutsche Monatshefte}}'' promoted an increasingly radical right-wing platform, supporting militarists [[Alfred von Tirpitz]] and [[Erich Ludendorff]] while excoriating more moderate military and political elements.&lt;ref name="hchk"/&gt; In 1916, Cossmann and his magazine defended Tirpitz's [[U-boat Campaign (World War I)|submarine war policy]], submitting evidence that Tirpitz critic [[Veit Valentin]] had falsified military reports.&lt;ref&gt;Scheck, pp. 51–52&lt;/ref&gt; These were times of notoriety for the magazine: prior to the war, ''{{lang|de|Süddeutsche Monatshefte}}'' circulation stood at a few hundred copies,&lt;ref&gt;Alexandre, p. 96&lt;/ref&gt; rising to 3000-5000 ca. 1914, and increasing sharply after that, reaching 100,000 at times.&lt;ref name="hchk"/&gt;

[[File:Kriegshefte der Süddeutschen Monatshefte.jpg|thumb|200px|October 1918 issue of the ''{{lang|de|Süddeutsche Monatshefte}}'' "war book"]]
The journal hosted topical literature on war politics and alarming reports from the field, including Spahn's coverage of civilian defeatism in [[Alsace-Lorraine]].&lt;ref&gt;Verhey, p. 95&lt;/ref&gt; In 1915, [[Eduard Meyer]], [[Georg Kerschensteiner]], and [[Ludwig Curtius]] published here their thoughts on the political and historical revelations of war, introducing theses about nationalist rivalry as the source of progress and European civilization.&lt;ref&gt;Jürgen von Ungern-Sternberg, "Wie gibt man dem Sinnlosen einen Sinn? Zum Gebrauch der Begriffe 'deutsche Kultur' und 'Militarismus' im Herbst 1914", in [[Wolfgang Mommsen]], Elisabeth Müller-Luckner (eds.), ''Kultur und Krieg: Die Rolle der Intellektuellen, Künstler und Schriftsteller im Ersten Weltkrieg (Schriften des Historischen Kollegs. Herausgegeben von der Stiftung Historisches Kolleg. Kolloquien 34)'', pp. 77–78, 83–85. Munich: R. Oldenbourg Verlag, 1996.  {{ISBN|3-486-56085-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aiming to strengthen German propaganda in [[Spain and World War I|neutral Spain]], the magazine hosted exposes depicting [[Iberian Federalism]] as a product of French intrigues, and homages to the conservative [[Liberal-Conservative Party (Spain)|Mauristas]].&lt;ref&gt;Étienne Martin Saint-Léon, "Mélanges et notices. La légende de Ferrer. Une calomnie allemande réfutée", ''La Réforme Sociale'', Vol. 76, July–December 1918, pp. 138–140&lt;/ref&gt;

Taking much interest in the "[[Jewish Question]]" in [[Kingdom of Poland (1916–18)|German-occupied Poland]], ''{{lang|de|Süddeutsche Monatshefte}}'' exaggerated the magnitude of conflicts between Jews and Poles.&lt;ref&gt;"Affaires intérieures", ''Bulletin Périodique de la Presse Polonaise'', No. 8/1916, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; A special issue of February 1916 was dedicated to [[Ashkenazi Jews]]. It included a piece by {{Interlanguage link multi|Eugen Fuchs|de}} of the Jewish ''[[Centralverein deutscher Staatsbürger jüdischen Glaubens|Centralverein]]'', who urged for assimilation, the "unwavering cultivation of German sentiments".&lt;ref&gt;Christel Goldbach, ''Distanzierte Beobachtung: Theodor Wolff und das Judentum (Oldenburgische Beiträge zu Jüdischen Studien Band 11)'', p. 38. Oldenburg: [[University of Oldenburg]], 2002. {{ISBN|3-8142-0795-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also featured were articles by [[Zionism|Zionists]] [[Max Bodenheimer]] and [[Franz Oppenheimer]], who purported that "Eastern Jews" were natural allies of German nationalism. More radical Jewish intellectuals, primarily [[Kurt Blumenfeld]] and {{Interlanguage link multi|Moses Calvary|de}}, reacted against this juxtaposition, accusing Bodenheimer of having given up on Zionist ideals.&lt;ref&gt;Aschheim, pp. 163, 286–287&lt;/ref&gt; Cossmann was also irritated by the "uncritical" views of Bodenheimer and his followers, which, he argued, were essentially "platitudes".&lt;ref&gt;Aschheim, pp. 170–171&lt;/ref&gt;

The editorship viewed the [[German Revolution of 1918–19|November 1918 Revolution]] and consequent fall of the monarchy as a disaster; its nationalist agitation was strengthened in the wake of the [[Bavarian Council Republic|Munich Soviet Republic]] and the establishment of the [[Weimar Republic]].&lt;ref name="hchk"/&gt; In that context, its antisemitism also became more radical, integrating notions about "[[Jewish Bolshevism]]", and dropping ethical distinctions between assimilated and non-assimilated Jews,&lt;ref&gt;Aschheim, pp. 233, 300&lt;/ref&gt; although Cossmann remained rather critical of such analogies.&lt;ref name="wjc108"&gt;Cahnman, p. 108&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1919, it became the first mainstream publication to host an article by Müller's brother-in-law [[Gottfried Feder]]. The self-taught economist and [[German Workers' Party]] ideologue explained his fight against "[[Predatory lending|interest slavery]]", soon after developed into an explicitly antisemitic program.&lt;ref&gt;Albrecht Tyrel, "Gottfried Feder and the NSDAP", in [[Peter D. Stachura]] (ed.), ''The Shaping of the Nazi State'', pp. 50–54. London: [[Croom Helm]], 1978. {{ISBN|0-85664-471-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; At around the same time, the ''{{lang|de|Süddeutsche Monatshefte}}'' press put out a brochure by {{Interlanguage link multi|Elias Hurwicz|de}}, a Jewish Russian refugee in Berlin. Its pessimistic prognosis was that [[world revolution]] had become an unstoppable "torrent".&lt;ref&gt;[[Ralf Georg Reuth]], "Woher kam Hitlers Judenhass?", in Tobias Daniel Wabbel (ed.), ''Das Heilige Nichts. – Gott nach dem Holocaust'', pp. 116, 268. Düsseldorf: Patmos Verlag, 2007.  {{ISBN|978-3-491-72510-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Versailles and "stab-in-the-back" claim==
Circulation remained high in 1918–1920, before steadily declining over the subsequent decade.&lt;ref name="hchk"/&gt; Cossmann found backing from powerful industrialists, aristocrats, and [[Bavarian People's Party]] (BVP) figures, who also sponsored him and his secretary Franz von Gebsattel to buy and publish the daily ''{{lang|de|Münchner Neuste Nachrichten}}'', overbidding their Jewish competitors.&lt;ref&gt;Cahnman, pp. 107–109. See also Struve, pp. 240–241&lt;/ref&gt; This circle included Tirpitz, Prince {{Interlanguage link multi|Eugen zu Oettingen-Wallerstein|de|3=Eugen Fürst zu Oettingen-Wallerstein}} of the secretive ''Gäa-Club'', [[Gustav Ritter von Kahr|Gustav von Kahr]], [[Albert Vögler]], and corporate backers from the ''[[Gute Hoffnungshütte]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Cahnman, pp. 107–109; Scheck, pp. 89–91, 148&lt;/ref&gt; Although Kahr's ally, Cossmann did not support its regionalist platform, and was only interesting to [[Bavarian nationalism|Bavarian nationalists]] as an enemy of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democratic Party]] (SPD).&lt;ref&gt;Cahnman, pp. 108–109&lt;/ref&gt; He was sympathetic toward [[Karl Jarres]] of the mainstream [[German People's Party]], trying to obtain him votes from the BVP.&lt;ref&gt;Scheck, p. 196&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1922, however, he and other ''{{lang|de|Süddeutsche Monatshefte}}'' men were involved in Tirpitz's conspiratorial project against Weimar, which discussed the creation of a German dictatorship under Kahr.&lt;ref&gt;Scheck, pp. 96, 98–102. See also Struve, pp. 243–245&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1921, Cossmann's magazine took notice of the emerging [[Conservative Revolutionary movement]], accepting its critique of ''[[Völkisch movement|Völkisch]]'' traditionalism, and bringing in the radical sociologist {{Interlanguage link multi|Max Hildebert Boehm|de}} as a contributor.&lt;ref&gt;[[Klemens von Klemperer]], ''Germany's New Conservatism. Its History and Dilemma in the Twentieth Century'', pp. 110–111, 236. Princeton: [[Princeton University Press]], 1957.  {{OCLC|27968987}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ricarda Huch]] also contributed, in March 1923, with ''{{lang|de|Schlagwörterkrieg}}'' ("War of Slogans"), a [[National-Anarchism|national-anarchist]] satire of the [[League of Nations]].&lt;ref&gt;Claudia Bruns, "Ricarda Huch und die Konservative Revolution", in ''WerkstattGeschichte'', Vol. 25, 2000, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; Another noted presence was philosopher [[Oswald Spengler]], whose writings for ''{{lang|de|Süddeutsche Monatshefte}}'' talked about recapturing the "spirit of 1914", theorized as a [[Voluntarism (metaphysics)|voluntarist]] reshaping of power relations.&lt;ref&gt;Verhey, pp. 94–95&lt;/ref&gt; Spengler reassured Cossmann's readers that the [[Treaty of Versailles]] was a mere "pause for breath" in the otherwise unstoppable progress of [[Pan-Germanism]].&lt;ref&gt;Struve, p. 251&lt;/ref&gt;

The journal railed above all against Versailles' [[Article 231 of the Treaty of Versailles|War Guilt Clause]],&lt;ref name="hchk"/&gt; campaigning for the return of [[German colonial empire|German colonies]], and publishing in 1924 [[Heinrich Schnee]]'s highly popular tract, ''{{lang|de|Die koloniale Schuldlüge}}'' ("The Lie of the Colonial Guilt").&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, pp. 203–205, 320&lt;/ref&gt; It also explored in depth the crisis of [[German nobility]], with essays by aristocrats such as {{Interlanguage link multi|Otto von Taube|de}}&lt;ref&gt;Dina Gusejnova, "Noble Continent? German-speaking Nobles as Theorists of European Identity in the Interwar Period", in Mark Hewitson, Matthew D'Auria (eds.), ''Europe in Crisis: Intellectuals and the European Idea, 1917–1957'', pp. 121, 130. New York: [[Berghahn Books]], 2012. {{ISBN|978-0-85745-727-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ewald von Kleist-Schmenzin]]. In his contribution, the latter also sketched out a plan for [[Drang nach Osten|German settlement in the East]].&lt;ref&gt;Stephan Malinowski, "From King to Führer: The German Aristocracy and the Nazi Movement", in ''GHIL Bulletin'', Vol. 27, Issue 1, 2005, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

''{{lang|de|Süddeutsche Monatshefte}}'' also became notorious by advocating for the [[stab-in-the-back myth]], according to which Germany had not been truly defeated in 1918, but betrayed from within. The accusation, backed by the Spenglerian philosophical stance (defeat was a failure of national will),&lt;ref&gt;Verhey, p. 223&lt;/ref&gt; was notably taken up by Cossmann—with a focus on the wartime Social Democrats. The ''[[Münchener Post]]'' responded by criticizing Cossmann, and Cossmann sued the ''Post'' editor, Martin Gruber, for libel; it became a celebrity trial.&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Ziemann, ''Contested Commemorations: Republican War Veterans and Weimar Political Culture'', p. 202. Cambridge: [[Cambridge University Press]], 2013.  {{ISBN|978-1-107-02889-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cossmann won when Judge [[Hans Frank]], himself a radical nationalist, ruled that he had acted in the public interest by publishing wartime letters attributed to SPD pacifist [[Felix Fechenbach]].&lt;ref&gt;Cahnman, pp. 107–108&lt;/ref&gt; ''{{lang|de|Süddeutsche Monatshefte}}'' helped instigate the political trial against Fechenbach.&lt;ref&gt;Scheck, p. 183&lt;/ref&gt;

==Late 1920s polemics==
In its final decade, ''{{lang|de|Süddeutsche Monatshefte}}'' became "mainstream",&lt;ref name="dtm18"&gt;Murphy, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; a "serious journal of the conservative bourgeoisie", hosting contributions by right-wing assimilated Jews such as [[Leo Baeck]], alongside antisemitic Germans like [[Theodor Fritsch]], [[Ernst Jünger]], and [[Ernst Graf zu Reventlow|Count Reventlow]].&lt;ref name="be121–2"&gt;Bernd Weisbrod, "Violence guerrière et fondamentalisme masculin: Ernst Jünger", ''Genèses'', Vol. 33, 1998, pp. 121–122&lt;/ref&gt; Like the BVP, it was ambiguous toward the nascent [[Nazism|Nazi movement]] in the wake of the Nazis' [[Beer Hall Putsch]]. Spengler, who felt that Nazi adventurism had ruined his own budding project for an industrialist [[timocracy]], broke with the Cossmann club, denouncing its failure to preclude the Putsch.&lt;ref&gt;Struve, pp. 244–246&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1927, the magazine again had a focus on eugenics, as well as [[racial hygiene]] and [[natalism]]. Hosting a topical essay by Spengler, it had contributions by eugenicists [[Otmar Freiherr von Verschuer]], [[Alfred Ploetz]], and [[Fritz Lenz]].&lt;ref&gt;Liliane Crips, "Du féminisme comme décadence. Le discours sur les femmes des droites conservatrices et révolutionnaires sous la République de Weimar et le IIIe Reich", ''L'Homme et la Société'', Vol. 99, 1991, p. 93&lt;/ref&gt; Issuing predictions about the "fate of our race", Lenz discussed the [[Nordic race]] in relation to the German people, while statistician [[Richard Korherr]] contributed ''Geburtenrückgank'' ("Birth Rate"), a much-read study of the West's [[population decline]].&lt;ref&gt;Andrea D'Onofrio, ''Razza, sangue e suolo. Utopie della razza e progetti eugenetici nel ruralismo nazista'', pp. 12, 122. Naples: ClioPress, 2007.  {{ISBN|978-88-88904-08-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; These works were complimented in 1929 by a {{Interlanguage link multi|Friedrich Burgdörfer|de}} essay on [[biopolitics]] and the alleged Slavic population pressure on Germany's [[Former eastern territories of Germany|eastern frontier]], suggesting counteraction through German recolonization.&lt;ref name="dtm18"/&gt; In other ways the magazine contradicted ''Völkisch'' tenets. Sexologist [[Max von Gruber]] wrote that most of the "greatest men of our race" were not purely Nordic, but "hybrids", and that productive [[miscegenation]] was in the national character.&lt;ref&gt;[[Rudolf Rocker]], ''Nationalismus und Kultur'', p. 309. Münster: Bibliothek Thélème, 1999.  {{ISBN|3-930819-23-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Franz Spina]]'s 1928 piece on the [[Sudeten Germans]] expressed support for a rapprochement between Germany and the [[First Czechoslovak Republic|Czechoslovak Republic]].&lt;ref&gt;Johann Wolfgang Brügel, ''Czechoslovakia before Munich. The German Minority Problem and British Appeasement Policy'', p. 30. London: [[Cambridge University Press]], 1973.  {{ISBN|0-521-08687-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, as noted by historian Bernd Weisbrod, ''{{lang|de|Süddeutsche Monatshefte}}''{{'}}s [[racial antisemitism]] was of the moderate variety embraced by the [[German National People's Party|National Populists]]. This was notably illustrated by its hosting, in September 1930, of an article by Jünger, in which the novelist suggested that [[Auto-segregation|self-segregation]] was "the most efficient weapon" against Jews.&lt;ref name="be121–2"/&gt;

Returning to its critique of cultural imports at the height of the international [[Jazz Age]], the magazine was focusing its attacks on modern American culture, and especially its [[Negermusik|African component]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael H. Kater, "The Impact of American Popular Culture on German Youth", in Jonathan Huener, Francis R. Nicosia (eds.), ''The Arts in Nazi Germany: Continuity, Conformity, Change'', pp. 35–36. New York: [[Berghahn Books]], 2006.  {{ISBN|978-1-84545-209-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Korherr and {{Interlanguage link multi|Wilhelm von Schramm|de|3=Wilhelm Ritter von Schramm}} took up Spenglerian themes about the "inconsiderate", "nihilistic", "Americanized" architecture of [[1920s Berlin|modern Berlin]].&lt;ref&gt;Christian Sieg, "Heimat Berlin. Siegfried Kracauer und Alfred Döblin als urbane Ethnografen der klassischen Moderne", in Friederike Eigler, Jens Kugele (eds.), ''Heimat. At the Intersection of Memory and Space'', pp. 94–95. Berlin: [[Walter de Gruyter]], 2012.  {{ISBN|978-3-11-029187-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jünger's articles, however, showed leniency toward modernization and a more critical stance against ''Völkisch'' tropes: he conceived of the "German national revolution" as an urban uprising, and decried peasant conservatism as outdated, "doomed to failure".&lt;ref&gt;Elliot Y. Neaman, ''A Dubious Past: Ernst Jünger and the Politics of Literature after Nazism'', p. 44. Berkeley: [[University of California Press]], 1999.  0-520-21628-8&lt;/ref&gt; ''{{lang|de|Süddeutsche Monatshefte}}'' writers were also undecided about the import of [[physical education]] and the Weimar youth's emphasis on recreational sport: [[Ulrich von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff|Ulrich von Wilamowitz]] deplored these developments, while [[Wilhelm Wien]] saw in them signs of recovery from "the postwar chaos".&lt;ref&gt;[[Hans Ulrich Gumbrecht]], ''In 1926: Living on the Edge of Time'', pp. 314, 318. Cambridge: [[Harvard University Press]], 1997.  {{ISBN|0-674-00056-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The popularity of [[Esotericism in Germany and Austria|German occultism]] and [[alternative medicine]] was examined by Cossmann's journal, over several issues. Astrologers such as {{Interlanguage link multi|Oscar A. H. Schmitz|de}} were allowed to introduce their work to the magazine's middle-class readership, although their essays generally refrained from making astrological inferences.&lt;ref&gt;Treitel, pp. 133–134, 306, 308&lt;/ref&gt; With articles by [[Sven Hedin]] and others, the magazine expressed skepticism against the fantastic travel accounts of [[Ferdynand Antoni Ossendowski|F. Ossendowski]], and against modern mysticism in general.&lt;ref&gt;Wim Coudenys, "Bêtes, hommes et dieux: les chimères de F. Ossendowski pendant la révolution", in Eddy Stols, Werner Thomas, Johan Verberckmoes (eds.), ''Naturalia, mirabilia &amp; monstrosa en los Imperios Ibéricos: siglos XV-XIX'', pp. 323–327. Leuven: [[Leuven University Press]], 2006.  {{ISBN|978-90-5867-556-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nazi ascendancy to power==
Shortly after the onset of the [[Great Depression]], ''{{lang|de|Süddeutsche Monatshefte}}'' resumed campaigning for "the revival of war generation" and the fulfillment of its "historical destiny"—themes central to the essays of [[Edgar Julius Jung]], which saw print in Cossmann's magazine.&lt;ref&gt;Herbert F. Ziegler, ''Nazi Germany's New Aristocracy. The SS Leadership, 1925–1939'', p. 67. Princeton: [[Princeton University Press]], 1989.  {{ISBN|0-691-05577-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1920s, Jung was outlining here his vision of [[neo-feudalism]], [[communalism]] and [[grassroots democracy]], as conservative resources against centralizing SPD governments.&lt;ref&gt;Struve, pp. 331, 337–338&lt;/ref&gt; With monarchism on the decline, the journal still gave exposure to [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Wilhelm II]]'s apologists, hosting {{Interlanguage link multi|Adalbert Wahl|de}}'s 1929 study "The Monarchy in German History".&lt;ref&gt;Struve, p. 221&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the journal's contributors looked into new forms of authoritarianism. Jünger's 1930 text lambasted liberalism and [[Italian Fascism]], noting that the latter only existed as a "simplified and shortened" version of the former. He envisaged a "stricter solution" to Germany's political and economic woes.&lt;ref&gt;Maurizio Bach, Stefan Breuer, ''Faschismus als Bewegung und Regime: Italien und Deutschland im Vergleich'', p. 192. Wiesbaden: [[VS Verlag]], 2010.  {{ISBN|978-3-531-17369-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The economic crisis brought in opportunities for [[Corporatism|corporatist]] and [[social credit]] schemes, which were taken up by {{Interlanguage link multi|Ludwig Reiners|de}}, who proposed creating a national labor conscription service on such grounds. After a republican [[Reichsarbeitsdienst|Voluntary Labor Service]] came into force in 1932, an article by {{Interlanguage link multi|Werner Beumelburg|de}} celebrated its role in national pedagogy and social advancement.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wolfgang Benz]], "Vom freiwilligen Arbeitsdienst zur Arbeitsdienstpflicht", in ''Vierteljahrshefte für Zeitgeschichte'', Vol. 16, Issue 4, 1968, pp. 320, 332&lt;/ref&gt;

The journal's conservative position was at odds with Nazism, just as the latter was growing in popularity and numerical strength. Reventlow, who had since adhered to the [[Nazi Party]], still frequented the ''{{lang|de|Süddeutsche Monatshefte}}'', where, in September 1930, he published a Nazi manifesto that called not just for "complete separation" from the Jews, but also for their "annihilation".&lt;ref&gt;Cahnman, p. 111&lt;/ref&gt; Cossmann himself rejected [[Nazism and race|Nazi racial theory]] but, as sociologist Werner Jacob Cahnman has noted, his earlier work in propaganda had unwittingly given the Nazis "a rousing slogan and terrific impetus". According to Cahnman, Cossmann "just did not wish to see the writing on the wall".&lt;ref name="wjc107"/&gt;

In early 1933, Cossmann and his collaborator {{Interlanguage link multi|Erwein von Aretin|de}}, who had openly criticized [[Adolf Hitler]] in 1923, called for a monarchist coup against the nascent [[Nazi Germany|Nazi regime]] that would see [[Rupprecht, Crown Prince of Bavaria|Crown Prince Rupprecht]] placed on the throne. Setting out its platform, the magazine's January cover bore the title "King Rupprecht". The pair were arrested and imprisoned.&lt;ref name="hchk"/&gt; Cossmann, described by scholar Steven E. Aschheim as "a tragic victim of the breakdown of the German–Jewish symbiosis",&lt;ref&gt;Aschheim, p. 170&lt;/ref&gt; was sent to the ghetto of [[Berg am Laim]] in 1941, and died at [[Theresienstadt concentration camp]] in 1942.&lt;ref name="wjc108"/&gt;

The magazine continued to run to 1936 under Nazi publisher {{Interlanguage link multi|Leo Hausleiter|de}}, but became both insignificant and apolitical during this last phase.&lt;ref name="hchk"/&gt; A late controversy came in October 1933, when {{Interlanguage link multi|Paul Wentzcke|de}} commemorated in his articles [[Rhenish Republic|1920s Rhenish separatism]], depicting it as a popular self-help movement against Weimar incompetence.&lt;ref&gt;S. A. Schuker, "Bayern und der rheinische Separatismus", in ''Jahrbuch des Historischen Kollegs 1997'', 1998, pp. 105–106&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the final issues had encomiums of [[Nazi architecture]], penned by art reviewers such as {{Interlanguage link multi|Hubert Schrade|de}} (who celebrated the [[Nuremberg Rally]] as a "sacred space").&lt;ref&gt;Steffen Krämer, "Achsen für den Aufmarsch. Zur politischen Inszenierung des urbanen Raumes im Dritten Reich", in ''Schriftenreihe der Winckelmann Akademie für Kunstgeschichte München Textbeitrag Nr. 18'', February 2014, pp. 8, 16&lt;/ref&gt; Having already hosted comments by {{Interlanguage link multi|Erwin Liek|de}} on [[holistic health]] in November 1932,&lt;ref&gt;Treitel, pp. 157, 312&lt;/ref&gt; other such issues had contributions by Nazified [[Neo-Adlerian]] therapists: [[Fritz Künkel]], who favored reintegrating patients within the "greater community"; and [[Harald Schultz-Hencke]], who talked about a "rediscovery of the soul" by psychiatric science.&lt;ref&gt;[[Laurence A. Rickels]], ''Nazi Psychoanalysis. Volume II'', pp. 189–190, 209. Minneapolis: [[University of Minnesota Press]], 2002.  {{ISBN|0-8166-3699-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''{{lang|de|Süddeutsche Monatshefte}}'' also published, in February 1936, the first version of [[Carl Jung]]'s introductory essay, "Psychological Typology".&lt;ref&gt;[[Herbert Read]], [[Michael Fordham]], [[Gerhard Adler]] (eds.), ''General Bibliography of C.G. Jung's Writings. Volume Nineteen'', p. 29. Princeton &amp; Hove: [[Princeton University Press]] &amp; [[Routledge]], 1979.  {{ISBN|978-0-415-04558-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2750">:''The Norka is also the name of a restaurant in Akron, Colorado.''

'''The Norka''' is a fairy tale from [[Andrew Lang]]'s ''[[The Red Fairy Book]]''. Lang gives no source for the tale, but it is taken verbatim from the book Russian Folk-tales by W. R. S. Ralston, published in 1873 by Smith, Elder, &amp; co. and re-published by [[Kessinger Publishing]] in 2004.

The King is unable to destroy the Norka, a huge beast who is devouring his animals. He offers half his kingdom to any one of his sons who kills the Norka. The two eldest sons drink and revel instead of hunting the beast. The youngest third son, a simpleton, wounds and chases the beast. The beast escapes under a great stone. The third son descends to the underworld and meets a talking horse who calls him Ivan and takes him to a copper palace owned by a beautiful woman, a sister of the Norka. He travels to a silver palace and a golden palace, also owned by the sisters of the Norka. The third and youngest sister tells him that Norka is asleep on the sea. She gives him a sword and the Water of Strength, and tells him to cut off her brother's head with a single stroke. He cuts off the Norka's head, which says "Well, I'm done for now!", and rolls into the sea. 

The three sisters are in love with him, so he takes them with him to the surface world. They change their palaces into eggs with magic, teach him how to do it, and give him the eggs. His brothers pull the three maidens up, but try to kill the third son by cutting the rope halfway up. He substituted a stone for himself, however, so he was not killed. Stranded in the underworld, he sadly wandered away as it rains. He covers some baby birds with his coat to protect them from the rain. The giant mother bird is grateful and carries him to the surface.

A tailor tells him that the two princes are going to marry the maidens from the underworld, but the maidens refuse to be married until wedding dresses are made in the underworld style, and without measuring them. The third son tells the tailor to accept the job to make the clothes for the wedding. At night, the third son turns the eggs into palaces, takes the maiden's clothes from the palaces, and turns the palaces into eggs again. He gives the dresses to the tailor who is paid richly by the King. He visits the shoemaker and other artificers and does the same thing. The youngest maiden recognizes him (in rags), grabs him, and takes him to the palace. She explains to the king what happened and that the brothers threatened to kill them if they said the third son was alive. The King punishes the two brothers. Three weddings are celebrated.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6510">{{for|the book by Marshall McLuhan|The Medium Is the Massage}}
{{Primary sources|date = July 2013}}"'''The medium is the message'''" is a phrase coined by [[Marshall McLuhan]] meaning that the form of a [[media (communication)|medium]] embeds itself in any [[message]] it would transmit or convey, creating a symbiotic relationship by which the medium influences how the message is perceived.

== Publications ==
The phrase was introduced in McLuhan's book ''[[Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man]]'', published in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;Originally published in 1964 by Mentor, New York; reissued 1994, MIT Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts with an introduction by [[Lewis H. Lapham|Lewis Lapham]]&lt;/ref&gt; McLuhan proposes that a medium itself, not the content it carries, should be the focus of study. He said that a medium affects the society in which it plays a role not only by the [[Content (media)|content]] delivered over the medium, but also by the characteristics of the medium itself.

McLuhan frequently punned on the word "message", changing it to "mass age", "mess age", and "massage"; a later book, ''[[The Medium Is the Massage]]'' was originally to be titled ''The Medium is the Message'', but McLuhan preferred the new title, which is said to have been a [[The Medium Is the Massage#Origin of the title|printing error]].

Concerning the title, McLuhan wrote "The title “The Medium Is the Massage" is a teaser—a way of getting attention. There’s a wonderful sign hanging in a Toronto junkyard which reads, “Help Beautify Junkyards. Throw Something Lovely Away Today.” This is a very effective way of getting people to notice a lot of things. And so the title is intended to draw attention to the fact that a medium is not something neutral—it does something to people. It takes hold of them. It rubs them off, it massages them and bumps them around, chiropractically, as it were, and the general roughing up that any new society gets from a medium, especially a new medium, is what is intended in that title."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=McLuhan |first=Marshall |date=1967-03-19 |title=McLuhan: Now The Medium Is The Massage |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1967/03/19/107185353.html?action=click&amp;contentCollection=Archives&amp;module=LedeAsset&amp;region=ArchiveBody&amp;pgtype=article&amp;pageNumber=179 |work=New York Times |access-date=2018-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Key concepts ==

For McLuhan, it was the medium itself that shaped and controlled "the scale and form of human association and action".&lt;ref&gt;McLuhan, ''Understanding Media'', p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Taking the movie as an example, he argued that the way this medium played with conceptions of speed and time transformed "the world of sequence and connections into the world of creative configuration and structure."&lt;ref name="page-12"&gt;McLuhan, ''Understanding Media'', p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the message of the movie medium is this transition from "lineal connections" to "configurations".&lt;ref name="page-12" /&gt;

Extending the argument for understanding the medium as the message itself, he proposed that the "content of any medium is always another medium"&lt;ref name="page-8"&gt;McLuhan, ''Understanding Media'', p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; – thus, speech is the content of writing, writing is the content of print, and print itself is the content of the telegraph.

McLuhan understood "medium" in a broad sense. He identified the light bulb as a clear demonstration of the concept of "the medium is the message". A light bulb does not have content in the way that a newspaper has articles or a television has programs, yet it is a medium that has a social effect; that is, a light bulb enables people to create spaces during nighttime that would otherwise be enveloped by darkness. He describes the light bulb as a medium without any content. McLuhan states that "a light bulb creates an environment by its mere presence."&lt;ref name="page-8" /&gt;

Likewise, the message of a newscast about a heinous crime may be less about the individual news story itself — the content — and more about the change in public attitude towards crime that the newscast engenders by the fact that such crimes are in effect being brought into the home to watch over dinner.&lt;ref name="Federman" /&gt;

Hence in ''Understanding Media'', McLuhan describes the "content" of a medium as a juicy piece of meat carried by the burglar  to distract the watchdog of the mind.&lt;ref&gt;McLuhan, Marshall (1964) Understanding Media, Routledge, London&lt;/ref&gt; This means that people tend to focus on the obvious, which is the content, to provide us valuable information, but in the process, we largely miss the structural changes in our affairs that are  introduced subtly, or over long periods of time.&lt;ref name="Federman"&gt;Federman, M. (2004, July 23). What is the Meaning of the Medium is the Message? Retrieved &lt;Oct 9, 2008&gt; from http://individual.utoronto.ca/markfederman/article_mediumisthemessage.htm .&lt;/ref&gt; As society's values, norms, and ways of doing things change because of the technology, it is then we realize the social implications of the medium.  These range from cultural or religious issues and historical precedents, through interplay with existing conditions, to the secondary or tertiary effects in a cascade of interactions&lt;ref name="Federman" /&gt; that we are not aware of.

On the subject of [[art history]], McLuhan interpreted [[Cubism]] as announcing clearly that the medium is the message. For him, Cubist art required "instant sensory awareness of the whole"&lt;ref name="page-13"&gt;McLuhan, ''Understanding Media'', p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; rather than perspective alone. In other words, with Cubism one could not ask what the artwork was about (content),&lt;ref name="page-13" /&gt; but rather consider it in its entirety.

The '''three-martini lunch''' or '''noontime three-martini''' is a term used in the [[United States]] to describe a leisurely, indulgent [[lunch]] enjoyed by [[businessperson|businesspeople]] or [[lawyer]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2010-06-01|title=Lunch with a twist: one writer asks what became of the noontime three-martini extravaganza-and discovers what happens when you try it.|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-227881937.html}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; It refers to a common belief that many people in such professions have enough leisure time and wherewithal to consume more than one [[martini (cocktail)|martini]] during the work day.  

As business matters may be discussed at them, three-martini lunches are considered a business expense (which includes travel, meals, etc.) and thus can qualify for a [[tax deduction]] if such lunches occur infrequently.&lt;ref name="kunztman"&gt;Kuntzman, Gersh, [http://www.newsweek.com/id/75472/output/print "Martinis for Victory!"], ''[[Newsweek]]'', October 22, 2006 (URL last accessed March 13, 2008). {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090305132133/http://www.newsweek.com/id/75472/output/print |date=March 5, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Death of the Income Tax: A Progressive Consumption Tax and the Path to Fiscal Reform|first=Daniel S. |last=Goldberg|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2013|ISBN=9780199948819|OCLC=854753803|pp=25-26|quote=Consider the business lunch, made famous by former President Carter labeling it the "three martini lunch" ... presumably the business nature of the meal requires expenditure in excess of what the lawyer would spend on his usual lunch ... Suppose, however, that the lawyer and client have lunch together every day of the week...[s]hould either of them be able to deduct those everyday meals? Likely not, even for 50% of the cost of the meals. At least one U.S. Court of Appeals has said no in a case involving members of a law firm who met at lunchtime every day...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Decline ==

The three-martini lunch is no longer common practice for several reasons, including the implementation of "fitness for duty" programs by numerous companies, the decreased tolerance of [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] use,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sorich|first=Sonya|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070206104758/http://www.ledger-enquirer.com/mld/ledgerenquirer/15848970.htm|archivedate=February 6, 2007|url=http://www.ledger-enquirer.com/mld/ledgerenquirer/15848970.htm|title=Business drinkers walk fine line|work=[[Ledger-Enquirer|Columbus Ledger-Enquirer]]|date=October 26, 2006}} Internet Archive; URL last accessed June 4, 2010).''&lt;/ref&gt; a general decrease in available [[leisure time]] for business executives,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Drummond, Mike|url=http://www.hotel-online.com/News/PR2005_1st/Mar05_MartiniLunch.html|title=What Ever Happened to the 3 Martini Lunch?|publisher=[[The Charlotte Observer]]|date=March 14, 2005|accessdate=October 30, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; an increase in the size of the martini, and a decrease in the size of the tax deduction.&lt;ref name="kunztman" /&gt;

President [[John F. Kennedy]] of the US called for a crackdown on such tax breaks in 1961, but nothing was done at the time.&lt;ref name="Gruber"&gt;{{cite book|title=Public Finance and Public Policy|author=Jonathan Gruber|page=500|publisher=Macmillan|date=December 21, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jimmy Carter]] condemned the practice during the [[United States presidential election, 1976|1976 presidential campaign]].&lt;ref name="kunztman" /&gt;  Carter portrayed it as part of the unfairness in the nation's [[tax law]]s, claiming that the [[working class]] was subsidizing the "$50 martini lunch".&lt;ref name="stratton"&gt;{{cite news|last=Stratton|first=Jeremy|url=http://www.journalmpls.com/node/3918|title=The decline of the three-martini lunch|newspaper=Downtown Journal|location=Minneapolis-St. Paul|date=January 2, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This was because a "rich businessman" could write off this type of lunch as a business expense. After the election his opponent, incumbent [[President of the United States|President]] [[Gerald Ford]], in a 1978 speech to the [[National Restaurant Association]], responded with: "The three-martini lunch is the epitome of American efficiency. Where else can you get an earful, a bellyful and a snootful at the same time?"&lt;ref name="kunztman" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gray|first=W.

It was once popular in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington, D.C]]. but has declined since the early 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2002-04-02|title=The Three-Martini Lunch: It Used to Happen|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-342817.html}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; The practice has also been affected by changing views to alcohol consumption, while others have chosen to go with new drinks like [[Vodka Martini]] and [[Cosmopolitan (cocktail)|Cosmopolitan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2006-07-16|title=A new twist on the three-martini lunch: Times have changed and so have attitudes toward drinking and then going back to work.|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-148243451.html}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cost of some drinks have increased three times faster than the inflation rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2005-12-01|title=Nowadays, a three martini lunch puts you in the poor house.(News)|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-139313440.html}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The entertainment deduction, which includes meals, was reduced to 80 percent in 1987&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=1988-07-04|title=CHANGES IN TAX LAWS DILUTE THE THREE-MARTINI LUNCH|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1N1-1085380DC103D675.html}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to 50 percent in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://partners.nytimes.com/library/politics/072499tax-congress.html | title=House Puts 'Three-Martini Lunch' Tax Break Back on the Table | author=Alison Mitchell | date=24 July 1999 | work=[[The New York Times]] | accessdate=14 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Corporatism sidebar}}
{{Toryism|General}}
'''Tory corporatism'''&lt;ref name="WilliamStewart"&gt;William Stewart (1988). ''Understanding Politics: The Cultures of Societies and the Structures of Governments''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailyglobe.co.uk/comment/corporatism-a-daring-dream-part-i/ "Corporatism: A Daring Dream, Part I"].&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Corporatism|corporatist]] [[political culture]] that is distinct from [[fascist corporatism]] in that rather than having a [[dictatorship]] impose order through force, the Tory corporatist culture is already settled and ongoing. The Tory corporatist culture relies on existing shared values of its members and therefore does not feature a large [[police]] force. The theoretical source of legitimacy of a Tory corporatist culture is [[tradition]] and [[Social stratification|hierarchy]] of birth. 

While its members are [[Rational animal|rational beings]], the culture itself does not attempt to justify itself by [[reason]] as for instance a fascist corporatist culture does, but rather appeals to the way it has always been done. Tory corporatists feel that tradition is the rightful basis of [[society]]. The Tory corporatist culture is organized with rigid [[Social stratification|hierarchy]] defined by [[birth]] and [[Ageing|age]]. Tory corporatists view this hierarchy as fundamental to the proper functioning of the society. They do not value or seek to achieve [[Egalitarianism|equality]] because they believe it is an illusion and detrimental. Any [[Power (social and political)|power]] attained by those who seek equality is considered an illegitimate replacement. Merit does play a limited role in who has influence, but hierarchy of birth takes precedence over merit whenever there is a conflict between the two.{{citation needed|date=March 2009}}

The Tory corporate culture is based on the [[family]]. Small [[Corporate group (sociology)|corporate groups]] as well as the whole society are seen as a big family. For this reason, Tory corporatists tend to view time and goals in terms longer than one's own lifetime. Specialization of skills by small corporate groups tend to perpetuate the [[culture]] because it causes members to feel a sense of [[self-government]] and [[self-sufficiency]].

'''Valerius Josephus''' (Latin; Flemish: Valeer Jozef; French: Valère Joseph) '''Coucke''', 1888–1951, was a Belgian scholar and priest who was professor at the Grootseminarie Brugge (Grand Séminaire de Bruges) in the 1920s. His importance to modern scholarship comes from his writings in the field of Old Testament chronology. His study of the methods of the authors of the books of Kings and Chronicles led him to conclusions that were later discovered, independently, by [[Edwin R. Thiele]]. A distinctive of his approach was the use of citations in classical authors in order to obtain fixed dates in biblical history, most notably the date for the beginning of construction of [[Solomon’s Temple]].

== Biography ==
Coucke was born on 2 February 1888, in Poperinge, in the province of West-Flanders in Belgium. He studied in Leuven, where he obtained a bachelor's degree in theology (S.T.B.). He was ordained a priest of the Roman Catholic Church in 1912 and was appointed to several parishes: Bredene, Staden, and Hooglede (all in the diocese of Bruges in Belgium). In 1919, he became a professor at the Grootseminarie in Brugge/Bruges (Le Grand Séminaire de Bruges), where he taught sacramental theology and moral theology. In 1927 he became the seminary’s librarian and also bursar, responsible for the finances of the seminary. In 1928, he was appointed canon of the Holy Savior’s Cathedral of Bruges. He died on 20 December 1951, in Bruges.

== Academic Contributions ==

=== Comparison of his chronology to that of Thiele ===
Coucke broke precedent with the approach of the [[Documentary hypothesis|Documentary Hypothesis]] that was popular among European scholars in his day by starting with the working proposition that the chronological data of Kings and Chronicles represented authentic traditions that could be understood once the methods of the ancient scribes were determined. This was in contrast to the skepticism to such an approach inherent in the postulates of the prevalent higher-critical methodology, which assumed that the chronological and other historical data of the Bible’s historical books were the product of late-date editors, and hence were of little or no historical value.&lt;ref&gt;"Wellhausen has shown, by convincing reasons, that the synchronisms within the Book of Kings cannot possibly rest on ancient tradition, but are on the contrary simply the products of artificial reckoning." R. Kittel, ''A History of the Hebrews'', (London, 1986), II, P. 234.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The numerical errors in the Books of Kings have defied every attempt to ungarble them. Those errors are largely the creation of the editors who set out to write a synchronistic history of Judah and Israel, using as sources two sets of unrelated court chronicles . . . the editors did not execute the synchronisms skillfully." Cyrus Gordon, ''The World of the Old Testament'' (New York: 1958), p. 194.&lt;/ref&gt; Coucke departed from this presupposition-based approach, using instead the data of the biblical texts as his starting place (an inductive approach). From those data, he came to the following conclusions: 1) During the period of the divided kingdom, Judah’s regnal year began in the fall month of Tishri, whereas that of the northern kingdom, Israel, began in Nisan. (Coucke also allowed that the northern kingdom may have begun its calendar in the Egyptian month of Thoth, since Jeroboam resided in Egypt for many years before becoming the first king of Israel, but Coucke was wrong in assuming that at the time of Egypt’s [[Third Intermediate Period of Egypt|Third Intermediate Period]], Thoth came in the spring at the same time as the Hebrew Nisan.) 2) For the first few years of the divided kingdom, Judah used accession reckoning for its kings, whereas Israel used nonaccession reckoning.&lt;ref&gt;Accession reckoning counts the partial calendar year in which a king came to the throne as his "zero" year, whereas nonaccession reckoning counts it as his first year. Both methods were used in the ancient Near East. When reckoning spans of time counted by nonaccession reckoning, one year must be subtracted from the total for each monarch.&lt;/ref&gt; 3) During the rapprochement between the two kingdoms in the ninth century BC, Judah adopted Israel’s nonaccession reckoning. 4) Later, both kingdoms used accession reckoning until the end of their respective kingdoms, and 5) In order to make sense of the biblical data, coregencies, both those expressed explicitly in the text and those implied by the data, must be taken into account. This last principle has been much criticized when espoused by Thiele, but it is widely used by Egyptologists in their computations of Egyptian chronology.&lt;ref&gt;William J. Murnane, ''Ancient Egyptian Coregencies'' (Chicago: The Oriental Institute, 1977), esp. pp. 39, 44, 49, 81, 95, 169, 189–193, and 239.&lt;/ref&gt;

These five principles are identical to those later discovered by [[Edwin R. Thiele]], who was unaware of Coucke’s work when he published the results of his doctoral dissertation in 1944.&lt;ref&gt;Edwin R. Thiele, "The Chronology of the Kings of Judah and Israel," ''[[Journal of Near Eastern Studies]]'' 3 (1944), pp. 137–186.&lt;/ref&gt; It apparently was Thiele’s colleague, [[Siegfried Horn]], who introduced Thiele to the writings of Coucke when Horn came to America in 1946.&lt;ref&gt;Siegfried H. Horn, "The Chronology of King Hezekiah’s Reign," ''[[Andrews University Seminary Studies]]'' 2 (1964), p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; In his subsequent writings, Thiele acknowledged the earlier work of Coucke, and he was gratified that the discovery of these basic principles by two scholars working independently served to authenticate the soundness of their respective approaches.&lt;ref&gt;Edwin R. Thiele, ''The Mysterious Numbers of the Hebrew Kings'' (3d ed.; Grand Rapids: Kregel, 1981), p. 59, n. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; The two authors, however, differed somewhat on how to apply the principles they had discovered, so that their chronologies disagree in several places. They are in exact agreement at the beginning of the divided monarchy, which both Coucke and Thiele placed in the year starting in Nisan of 931 BC. Coucke’s method of deriving this date differed radically from Thiele’s method, as explained in the next two sections. For the end of the kingdom period, Coucke placed the fall of Jerusalem to the Babylonians in the summer of 587 BC, whereas Thiele put it a year later, in 586.

=== His use of the Parian Marble to date construction of Solomon’s Temple ===
Coucke had some difficulty in determining dates for Ahab, king of Israel, and so he did not place the [[Battle of Qarqar]], at which Ahab was present, as the last year of Ahab, as Thiele did in assigning absolute (BC) dates to the first kings of Israel. His date for the battle, 854 BC, was also one year too early, although that was the date used by most Assyriologists when he wrote. He knew that it would be unwise to assign absolute dates to the kings in this time frame based on his proposed emendations of their reign lengths, and so he sought a more reliable method of finding a fixed date for the early monarchic period.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} He developed such a method in just three sentences of his ''Supplément'' article, using classical authors with no utilization of any biblical text. His starting place was the end of the [[Trojan War]], which the [[Parian Marble]] dated to the year 1208 BC, seven days before the end of the month of Thargelion, that is, 10 June 1208 BC&lt;ref&gt;For the determination of the Julian date, see Rodger C. Young and Andrew E. Steinmann, “Correlation of Select Classical Sources Related to the Trojan War with Assyrian and Biblical Chronologies,” ''Journal for the Evangelical Study of the Old Testament'' 1.2 (2012) 235 n. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; (Coucke mistakenly thought that the Marble gave the year as 1207 BC, but the correct year of 1208 BC, as given at the Ashmolean Web site,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ashmolean.org/ash/faqs/q004/q004006.html&lt;/ref&gt; will be used in what follows). He then cited a statement of [[Gnaeus Pompeius Trogus|Pompeius Trogus/Justin]] (18:3:5) that said that Tyre was founded (or refounded)&lt;ref&gt;Tyre was in existence in the Amarna period (middle of 14th century BC), as shown by letters from its king to the pharaoh. However, it apparently had become abandoned and was subsequently resettled at the time of the invasion by the Sea Peoples, according to W. F. Albright, "The Role of the Canaanites in the History of Civilization" in G. E. Wright, ed., ''The Bible and the Ancient Near East'' (New York, 1961), p. 340, and H. J. Katzenstein, ''The History of Tyre from the Second Millennium B.C.E. until the Fall of the Neo-Babylonian Empire in 538 B.C.E.'' (Jerusalem, 1973), pp. 59–61. The first invasion of the Sea People was in the reign of [[Merneptah]] (ca. 1213–1203 BC). Coucke’s date of 1209 BC for the (re)founding of Tyre, as derived from Josephus, would place it in this first invasion of the Sea Peoples when, according to Pompeius Trogus, the people of Ashkelon were driven from their city, after which they occupied Tyre. The [[Merneptah stele]] from Merneptah’s fifth year says that "Carried off is Ashkelon."&lt;/ref&gt; one year before the fall of Troy, that is, in 1209 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Coucke assumed that the founding of Tyre was in the summer preceding the fall of Troy. With his date of May 1207 BC for the fall of Troy, the founding of Tyre would be the summer of 1208 BC. Using the Tishri-based years that Coucke assumed for Tyre, this would be the year starting in Tishri of 1209 BC.&lt;/ref&gt; From [[Josephus]], who apparently was using the archives of Tyre as his source, he determined that it was either 240 years (''[[Antiquities of the Jews|Antiquities]]'' 8:3:1/62) or 241 years (''[[Against Apion]]'' 1:18/126) from Tyre’s founding to the 11th or 12th year of [[King Hiram I|Hiram, King of Tyre]], at which time Hiram sent assistance to Solomon at the beginning of construction of the Temple in Jerusalem. Coucke therefore determined that Temple construction began in either (1209 BC – 240 =) 969 BC or (1209 BC – 241 =) 968 BC, depending on whether it was in the eleventh year of Hiram (so ''Antiquities'') or his twelfth year (so ''Against Apion'').&lt;ref&gt;V. Coucke, "Chronologie biblique" in ''Supplément au Dictionnaire de la Bible'' (ed. Louis Pirot; Paris: Librairie Letouzey et Ané, 1928), Vol. 1, col. 1251.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== His use of the Tyrian King List to refine this date ===
Coucke had another avenue of approach to the date of construction of Solomon’s Temple. Like the first approach that started from the Parian Marble’s date for the fall of Troy, his second method was also derived from classical writings, with no utilization of biblical texts. It made use of the [[List of Kings of Tyre|list of Tyrian kings]] recorded in Josephus’s [[Against Apion]] 1:17/108 and 1:18/117–126. In providing the list of kings, Josephus said he was taking his information from [[Menander of Ephesus]], who translated the records of the Tyrian archives from Phoenician into Greek. Although the individual reign lengths of the various kings in the list show considerable variation due to copying errors over the centuries since Josephus wrote, the total number of years given from the time that Hiram sent assistance to Solomon at the beginning of Temple construction to the flight of [[Dido (Queen of Carthage)|Dido/Elissa]] from Tyre, after which she and her associates founded [[Carthage]], has been preserved intact due to its three-fold repetition. This figure is given twice as 143 years and eight months, and once as 155 years from the accession of Hiram, minus the 12 years until he began to help Solomon. This redundancy of expression has preserved the total of years in virtually all extant copies of the Tyrian King List, so that Coucke and other scholars have felt confident in using it in their calculations.

Coucke derived either 825 or 824 BC as the possible dates for the founding of Carthage, based on Pompeius Trogus’s statement that it was founded 72 years before the founding of Rome, for which Coucke accepted either 753 BC ([[Marcus Terentius Varro|Varro]]) or 752 BC ([[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]]). Using the statement of Josephus/Menander that placed the founding of Solomon’s Temple 143 years earlier than the founding of Carthage, Coucke derived 968 or 967 BC as the dates for the founding of Solomon’s Temple. Since only the first of these agreed with the two dates he had derived when starting from the Parian Marble (969 and 968), he decided on 968/67 BC as the time of foundation of the Temple. He assumed Tyre used Tishri-based years, since the use of Phoenician month-names (Ziv, Bul, Ethanim) in the time of Solomon suggested that Israel and Tyre were using the same calendar at this time in their histories.&lt;ref&gt;V. Coucke, "Chronologie des rois de Juda et d’Israël," ''Revue bénedictine'' 37 (1925), p. 327.&lt;/ref&gt; With this assumption, he then turned to the biblical datum that construction began in the spring month of Ziv, deriving the date for the beginning of construction as the spring of 967 BC, with Solomon’s fourth year (1 Kings 6:1) starting in Tishri of 968 BC.

== Writings ==
Only two publications by Coucke are known. The earlier is the article "Chronologie des rois de Juda et d’Israël," ''Revue bénedictine'' 37 (1925), pp.&amp;nbsp;325–364. The ideas and chronology of this article were expanded and included in his contribution to the article "Chronologie biblique" in ''Supplément au dictionnaire de la Bible'', ed. Louis Pirot, vol. 1 (Paris: Librairie Letouzey et Ané, 1928), cols. 1245-1279. In late 2010, a search by the principal librarian of the Grootseminarie library, where Coucke had been principal librarian several decades previously, failed to find any further publications for which he was the author.
