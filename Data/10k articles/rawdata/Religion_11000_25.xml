The '''Adyar Library and Research Centre''' was founded in 1886 by theosophist [[Henry Steel Olcott]]. The library is at the [[Theosophical Society Adyar]] in Adyar, near [[Chennai]].

== History ==
[[Henry Steel Olcott]] founded the "library Olcott" in December 1886. Olcott's small private collection of approx. 200 books in 24 languages was the core of library. During his travels in Asia, Olcott acquired more and often rare books for the library. After Olcott's death in 1907, the library was continued by other theosophists. Today, the library has approx. 250,000 books and 20,000 palm leaves. The library is today among the most important orientalist libraries in the world.

The library was at first situated inside the headquarters of the Theosophical Society. In 1966 it was moved to a separate building, ''the Adyar Library Building''. It also has a public museum that shows old books and manuscripts. The Adyar library is also used by post-graduate students in [[Sanskrit]] and [[Indology]] of the [[University of Madras]].

In 1990, a bequest by the  [[Australian]] [[philanthropist]] [[Elliston Campbell]] (1891 – 1990) further funded the Adyar Library and founded the Campbell Theosophical Research Library, in [[Sydney]], [[Australia]].&lt;ref name="ctrl"&gt;[http://www.austheos.org.au/clibrary/newsletters/clnews200509.htm Campbell Theosophical Research Library] Retrieved 25 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[University of Chicago]] is trying to preserve the old works in the Adyar library with modern techniques.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.lib.uchicago.edu/e/su/southasia/soa3.html Projects on South Asia&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Published works==
LaHaye wrote ''The Spirit-Controlled Woman'' and ''The Desires of a Woman's Heart''.

==Concerned Women for America (CWA)==
LaHaye formed Concerned Women for America in 1979.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.salon.com/2014/07/29/how_conservative_christian_women_came_to_claim_true_feminism_partner/|title=How conservative Christian women came to claim "true" feminism|work=Salon.com|last=Smith|first=Leslie|date=29 July 2014|access-date=15 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, CWA was a reaction to the [[National Organization for Women]] and a 1978 [[Barbara Walters]] interview with feminist [[Betty Friedan]].&lt;ref name="gardiner"&gt;Gardiner, S., "[http://feminism.eserver.org/cw-of-a.txt Concerned Women for America: A Case Study] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130926115512/http://feminism.eserver.org/cw-of-a.txt |date=2013-09-26 }}", Feminism and Women's Studies, 28 August 2006. Online as of 19 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding the Friedan interview, LaHaye stated that she believed Friedan’s goal was "to dismantle the bedrock of American culture: the family,"&lt;ref name="Christian Examiner"/&gt; and that Christian women were not included in discussions of [[women's rights]]. LaHaye held a rally in a local [[San Diego]] auditorium which marked the beginning of CWA.&lt;ref name="Christian Examiner"&gt;[http://www.christianexaminer.com/Articles/Articles%20Dec09/Art_Dec09_06.html Beverly LaHaye marks three decades of promoting traditional values through CWA ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130919182256/http://www.christianexaminer.com/Articles/Articles%20Dec09/Art_Dec09_06.html |date=2013-09-19 }} ''Christian Examiner.com,'' 20 December 09.

'''Buddhism in Buryatia'''—a regional form of [[Buddhism]].

==The Spread of Buddhism into [[Buryatia]]&lt;ref name="a"&gt;Александр Берзин, Тибетский буддизм: история и перспективы развития, M., 1992 (Alexandr Berzin, ''Tibetan Buddhism: History and Future Prospects'', Moscow 1992; Буддизм, Л. Л. Абаева, М., Республика, 1991 (''Buddhism'', L.L. Abaeva, Respublika, Moscow 1991)&lt;/ref&gt;==
Historical evidence gives reason to believe that, from the 2nd century BCE, proto-Mongol peoples (the [[Xiongnu]], [[Xianbei]], and [[Khitan people|Khitans]]) were familiar with Buddhism. On the territory of the Ivolginsk Settlement, remains of Buddhist [[prayer beads]] were found in a Xiongnu grave.

At the beginning of the 17th century, [[Tibetan Buddhism]] penetrated northward from [[Mongolia]] to reach the [[Buryat people|Buryat]] population of [[Transbaikal]]ia (the area just east of [[Lake Baikal]]). Initially, Buddhism disseminated primarily among the ethnic groups that had recently migrated out of [[Khalka Mongols|Khalkha Mongolia]] (the Selenga and Zede Buryats). At the end of the 17th to the beginning of the 18th centuries, it spread throughout the Transbaikal region. A second branch came directly from [[Tibet]], from the [[Labrang Monastery]] in [[Amdo]].

==The Establishment of Buddhism==
[[File:Цогчен-дуган в Иволгинском дацане.jpg|thumb|300px|Dzogchen Dugan (temple) at the Ivolga Datsan, 2012]]
[[File:Иволгинский дацан - Зеленая Тара.jpg|thumb|300px|Green Tara Dugan at the Ivolga Datsan, 2012]]
* In 1701 there were eleven dugans (small Buryat Buddhist temples) in Transbaikalia.
* In 1722 the border was delineated between Mongolia and Russia. Buryat tribes living nomadically in the northern part of Mongolia then became part of Russia. The Russian government closed off the border, induced the Buryat nomads to take on a relatively settled lifestyle, and made itself the authority on the region's religious matters.
* Buddhist monastic universities, called [[datsans]], were built in Buryatia—including the one at Tsongol, completed in the early 1740s.
* In 1741 [[Elizabeth of Russia|Empress Elizabeth (Yelizaveta Petrovna)]] adopted a decree recognizing the existence of a "lamaist faith": She legally recognized the existence of eleven datsans, and with them 150 [[lama]]s. Buddhism was formally accepted as an official religion in the Russian Empire. (In July 1991 the Buddhists of Buryatia commemorated 250 years of official recognition of their religion).&lt;ref name="a" /&gt;
* For a long time in Buryat Buddhism there was a struggle for dominance between the Tsongol and Tamchinsky (Gusinoozyorsk) datsans. In 1764 the chief lama of the Tsongol Datsan became Supreme Lama of the Buryats of Transbaikalia, having received the title Pandit Hambo Lama ("learned prior"). Starting in 1809, supremacy passed to the priors of the [[Tamchinsky datsan]].
* By 1846, thirty-four datsans had been established in Buryatia. Applying a great deal of effort and material resources, the Buryats managed to import from Tibet, China, and Mongolia a large quantity of esoteric literature and to adopt many living traditions from the [[Gelug]]pa lineage and other schools of Buddhism.
* In 1869, the Mongolian lama Choi-Manramba began to lead instruction in Indo-Tibetan medicine at the Tsugol Datsan, and from there it spread.
* In 1878 the Duynhor Kalachakra School was founded at Aga Datsan, and this completed the establishment of the basic schools of spiritual higher education based on the Tibetan model.
* [[Printing|Book printing]] developed quickly. In 1887, twenty-nine [[Printer (publishing)|print shops]] were already in operation, which until their destruction in the 1930s published about 2000 book titles, written in [[Tibetic languages|Tibetan]] and [[Mongolian language|Mongolian]].
* At the end of the 19th century, Buddhism began a thorough penetration into Cisbaikalia (now Northern Buryatia), where it met fierce resistance from shamans and Christian missionaries.&lt;ref name="a" /&gt;
* In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, a great renewal movement began in Buryat Buddhism, and it gained additional impetus after the establishment of Soviet power in Buryatia.

==To the Present Day==

* In 1918 a law was adopted, the Decree on the Separation of Church from State and School from Church,&lt;ref&gt;[http://istrorijarossii.narod.ru/oreligii.htm Декрет Совета Народных Комиссаров (23 января 1918 г.) Об отделении церкви от государства и школы от церкви, Решения КПСС и Советского Государства о Религии и Церкви, История Нашей Страны] ("Decree of the Council of People's Commissars (23 January 1918) on the Separation of Church from State and School from Church," in "Resolutions of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet State on Religion and Church," ''The History of Our Country'')&lt;/ref&gt; which abolished religious education. In Buryatia this law came into effect in 1925. It destroyed the spiritual culture of the peoples of the new Soviet state, and for the Buryats specifically it meant the destruction of their Buddhist culture. Spiritual values created and accumulated over centuries were destroyed and erased in a short period of time. Of the forty-seven datsans and dugans operating at the beginning of the 20th century, almost nothing now remains. One thousand eight hundred and sixty-four highly learned lamas were sent to prison, into exile, or to hard labor; hundreds were shot to death.
* In the 1920s some Buryats resettled from Transbaikalia (mostly from Aga) to the Shenehen area of Inner Mongolia, and then continued their Buddhist traditions in addition to those which already existed in the region.&lt;ref name="a" /&gt;
* The Council of People's Commissars of the Buryat Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic passed a resolution on 2 May 1945 to open a Buddhist temple, Hambyn Sume, in a place called Srednyaya Ivolga. Ivolga Datsan in Buryatia and Aga Datsan in the Aga Buryat national district of Chita Oblast, have been open and operational since 1946.
* In 1991 a religious institution of higher education called Dashi Choynhorlin was opened at Ivolga Datsan for the training of priests, instructors, translators of canonical texts, artists, and iconographers. Training is carried out in accordance with the Goman Datsan monastic education system. In 1991 the number of operational datsans in Buryatia reached twelve.

==Local characteristics==
Buddhism in Buryatia is the northernmost extension of [[Vajrayana]] Buddhism in Central Asia. It is primarily the [[Gelug]] tradition from Tibet, although there are signs of influence from the [[Nyingma]] tradition as well. Buddhist followers in Buryatia revere the founder of the Gelug school, the great guru [[Je Tsongkhapa|Tsongkhapa]] (called Zonhobo in Buryat), on par with the founder of the entire Buddhist tradition, [[Gautama Buddha|Shakyamuni Buddha]]. Gelug adherents in Buryatia prefer to either use this self-designation for the tradition, or the general terms "teachings of the Buddha" or "Mahayana doctrine."

Buryat Buddhism shows slight deviations from general Mahayana tradition mainly in its system of religious practice, in its rituals and magical practices, and are due to the influence of traditional, more ancient and archaic beliefs, practices, and rituals of the Tibetans and of the Buryat-Mongols. In particular, the religious system of Buddhism incorporated and assimilated traditional folk ceremonies, rituals, and beliefs associated with the honoring of [[ovoo]]s, paying homage to spirits of the land, mountains, rivers, and trees. Among monastic religious practices, those of tantric origin, forming the basis of [[Vajrayana]] Buddhism, play an important role. In its philosophical, psychological and ethical teachings, Buryat Buddhism does not differ significantly from the fundamental provisions of Mahayana Buddhism as presented in the Tibetan version of the Buddhist canon referred to as the [[Kangyur]] (Ganzhuur in Buryat; 108 volumes) and the [[Tengyur]] (Danzhuur in Buryat; 225 volumes).

Buddhism has had a tremendous impact on the development of culture and scholarship among the Buryat-Mongols, particularly on the formation and development of philosophical thought, norms of morality, mental development, fictional literature, art, [[cooking]], and aspects of alternative medicine including chronobiology and bioenergetics.

Among the great variety of religious practices at Buryat datsans, there are six large ceremonies that take place: [[Tsagaan Sar|Sagaalgan]] (New Year); Duynher ([[Kalachakra]]); Gandan-Shunserme (the birth, enlightenment and parinirvana of Shakyamuni Buddha); Maidari-Hural (the anticipated coming of [[Maitreya]], the buddha of the next world epoch); Lhabab-Duysen (Buddha's descent from the heaven called [[Tushita]]); and Zul-Hural (commemoration of Tsongkhapa).

The Buddhist Society is an inter-denominational and non-sectarian lay organization. It offers talks and classes on the teachings of all the different major mainstream Buddhist schools and traditions, as well as a structured programme of courses on general Buddhism, for both the public and members. It has a publishing programme and in its premises houses one of the main libraries in Britain on Buddhism. It is managed by an elected council and its patron is the [[14th Dalai Lama]].

Among other publications, it produces ''The Buddhist Directory'', a reference book which lists the vast majority of Buddhist groups, centres and other related organisations in the United Kingdom and Ireland, and ''The Middle Way'', a quarterly journal.&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Buddhist Society: History|url=https://www.thebuddhistsociety.org/page/history|publisher=The Buddhist Society|accessdate=November 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
&lt;!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[File:Christmas-humphreys.jpg|thumb|170px|[[Christmas Humphreys]].]] --&gt;

The Society was created in 1924 in [[London]] as an offshoot of a [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophical]] Lodge by [[Christmas Humphreys]], a British judge and convert to [[Buddhism]].&lt;ref name="Bluck"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bluck|first=Robert|title=British Buddhism: Teachings, Practice and Development|publisher=[[Routledge]]|year=2006|pages=7-9|ISBN=978-0415483087}}&lt;/ref&gt; It became an independent body in 1926 and Humphreys remained its president until his death in 1983. In 1961 the 14th Dalai Lama became patron of the Society, the first organisation in the West to be so honoured.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;

The Buddhist Society was one of the first Buddhist organisations outside Asia and remains one of the oldest in Europe to date.

== Activities ==

The Buddhist Society runs a number of classes, courses and lectures, many of which are open to the general public. This includes Saturday meditation classes and popular Tuesday and Thursday lunchtime sessions. More specific members classes are offered in the Zen, Theravadan and Tibetan traditions. The Society is open on occasional Sundays to the public for 'Zen Sundays', 'Theravadan Sundays' and a Pure Land class.

Three courses are taught at the Society representing three levels of Buddhist study, the first of which, ‘Introducing Buddhism’, is free and open to the public. This can be followed by the Intermediate and advanced, 'Great Way' courses. A Correspondence Course is also available to those who are unable to study at a Buddhist centre.

Free public lectures are held at least once a month on a Wednesday evening. Topics are varied and concern not only the practical application of Buddhism but its cultural and historical aspects too. The guest speakers include academic as well as spiritual scholars of Buddhism. Special function days are held four times a year on Saturdays and are intended for those who do not live in London.
A Summer School is held annually in August, too. This one-week residential course is open to members of all Buddhist schools and explores the major aspects of the Buddha’s teachings and their practice. The Summer School is highly popular and is now in its 63rd year (2014).

== Publishing ==
 {{buddhism}}
For more than 50 years The Buddhist Society has published Buddhist works and continues to do so today. The Buddhist Directory is a comprehensive directory of Buddhist groups and organisations in the UK and Ireland. It also gives details of sizeable library collections, publishers and retailers of Buddhist literature and items.

The Society continues to print a selection of Buddhist classics and important new works including some titles by its founder Christmas Humphreys. Books can be bought by mail-order or in person at the Society.

''The Middle Way'' is the quarterly journal of the Buddhist Society and has been in print since 1926 originally under the title ''Buddhism in England''.&lt;ref name="Bluck"/&gt; The journal is respected worldwide and contains news and articles on Buddhist practice and history as well as details of the Society’s programme. Non-members can take out a subscription without joining the society.

== Facilities ==

In 1956 the Buddhist Society moved to its present location at 58 Eccleston Square in south-west London. The library on the ground floor, which began with just a few volumes in 1926, is now a collection in excess of 4,500 volumes. Members can request books by post and renew them by email and there is an online catalogue on the Society's website. The library also houses a small bookstall and offers items such as incense and cards for sale.

The Society’s Audio Department offers CDs and tapes of public lectures and courses for sale at a small cost and there is a free tape library for the registered blind.

The building also has a lecture hall and two shrine rooms and is a treasure house of Buddhist statuary and artefacts presented to the Society by donors from around the world.

== Membership ==

Membership includes subscription to ''The Middle Way'', access to all lectures, classes and courses and full use of the library services.

The Buddhist Society is located close to Victoria Station and is open to all Monday to Friday from 2pm to 6pm and on Saturdays until 5pm.

'''Chinese temples''' are sacred sites for the practice of [[Chinese folk religion]]. [[Kolkata]] has a significant population of Indian nationals of [[Chinese community in India|Chinese ethnic origin]] (immigrants and their descendants that emigrated from China starting in the late 18th century to work at the [[Port of Kolkata|Kolkata port]] as well as the [[Chennai port]]). Unofficial estimates puts the population of Indian nationals of Chinese-origin in Kolkata anywhere from 5,000 to 200,000, most of whom live in or near [[Chinatown, Calcutta|Tangra]].&lt;ref name="Banglapedia"&gt;{{cite book |last=Ray |first=Haraprasad |year=2012 |chapter=Chinese, The |chapter-url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Chinese,_The |editor1-last=Islam |editor1-first=Sirajul |editor1-link=Sirajul Islam |editor2-last=Jamal |editor2-first=Ahmed A. |title=Banglapedia: National Encyclopedia of Bangladesh |edition=Second |publisher=[[Asiatic Society of Bangladesh]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IPS News"&gt;{{cite web| last = Biswas| first = Ranjita| year = 2005| url = http://www.ipsnews.net/print.asp?idnews=30346| title = Little China Stays Alive in Eastern India| accessdate = 26 September 2006| work = IPS News| publisher = Inter Press Service News Agency| quote=Though most of the local Chinese are Christians, they celebrate the traditional Chinese New Year with gusto and many who emigrated from Kolkata make it a point to return at this time.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chinese brought with them their culture.

==Temples==
Though the places of worship are referred to as "churches", they are sites of veneration that adhere to [[Chinese traditional religion]] and have nothing to do with Christianity.

'''Chinmaya Mission''' is a [[Hindu]] spiritual organization engaged in the dissemination of [[Vedanta]], the science of the self as expounded in the [[Vedas]], particularly the [[Upanishads]], and other important Hindu scriptures including the [[Bhagavad Gita]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://chinmayala.org/content/chinmaya-mission|title=Chinmaya  Mission {{!}} CMLA|website=chinmayala.org|access-date=2017-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~venkat/Chinmaya%20Mission%20Delhi.htm|title=History of Chinmaya Mission|website=cseweb.ucsd.edu|access-date=2017-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chinmaya Mission was established in India in 1953 by devotees of the renowned Vedanta teacher Swami [[Chinmayananda Saraswati]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.chinmayavvdelhi.ac.in/history.php|title=Chinmaya|website=www.chinmayavvdelhi.ac.in|access-date=2017-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Administered by the Central Chinmaya Mission Trust in Mumbai, India, the mission was later headed by Swami [[Tejomayananda]] and is now headed by Swami Swaroopananda. There are over 313 mission centres all over India and abroad. North America had more than 30 centres.&lt;ref&gt;[http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/2059111871.cms today it has over 300 centres across the world..] ''[[Times of India]]'', December 25, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

The motto of Chinmaya Mission is "to give maximum happiness to maximum people for maximum time."

==History==
===Foundation===
Swami [[Chinmayananda Saraswati]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mapsofindia.com/on-this-day/8-may-1916-chinmayananda-saraswati-indian-spiritual-leader-was-born|title=8 May 1916: Chinmayananda Saraswati, Indian spiritual leader, was born|website=www.mapsofindia.com|access-date=2017-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dlshq.org/saints/chinmaya.htm|title=His Holiness Sri Swami Chinmayananda Saraswati Maharaj|website=www.dlshq.org|access-date=2017-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; the founder of Chinmaya Mission, taught spirituality as the art of living. Through [[jnana yoga]] (the Vedantic path of spiritual knowledge), he emphasized the balance of head and heart, pointing out selfless work, study, and meditation as the cornerstones of spiritual practice.

Not satisfied by worldly aspirations or his degrees in literature and law, Balakrishna Menon pursued spiritual studies for nine years in the Himalayas, under the guidance of [[Swami Sivananda]] ([[Divine Life Society]]) and the tutelage of Swami Tapovanam ([[Tapovan Maharaj]]). He eventually came to share this Vedantic knowledge with the masses, in the form of the dynamic teacher known as Swami Chinmayananda.

Swamiji is a teacher of Shrimad Bhagavad Gita. He is credited with the renaissance of spirituality and cultural values in India, and with the spreading of [[Advaita Vedanta]], as expounded by [[Adi Shankaracharya]], throughout the world.

===After Chinmayananda===
After Chinmayananda attained [[mahasamadhi]] in 1993, his disciple [[Swami Tejomayananda]] (known as ''Guruji'') became the global head of Chinmaya Mission. Under Guruji, projects such as the [[Chinmaya International Foundation]] and the [[Chinmaya International Residential School]] were taken up.

In January 2017, Swami Tejomayananda assigned the headship  of Chinmaya Mission Worldwide to sri [[Swami Swaroopananda]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.chinmayauk.org/news/official-handover-pujya-guruji-swami-tejomayananda-watch-live-stream/|title=Official handover by Swami Tejomayananda on 19 January 2017 – watch the live streamChinmaya Mission UK|website=www.chinmayauk.org|access-date=2017-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.indiandownunder.com.au/2016/12/pujay-guruji-swami-tejomayananda-hands-over-the-reins-of-chinamaya-mission-to-swami-swaroopnanada-on-january-19-2017/|title=Pujya Guruji Swami Tejomayananda hands over the reins of Chinamaya Mission to Swami Swaroopnanada on January 19, 2017 {{!}} The Indian Down Under|website=www.indiandownunder.com.au|language=en-US|access-date=2017-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Church of Scientology v. Sweden''''' (8282/78) was a case decided by the [[European Commission of Human Rights]] in 1980.

==Background==

In 1975, a Swedish newspaper published certain statements made in the course of lecture by a professor of theology, including that "Scientology in the most untruthful movement there is. It is the cholera of spiritual life. That is how dangerous it is".

Request by the [[Church of Scientology]] to start proceedings against the publisher was rejected by the [[Supreme Court of Sweden|Supreme Court]].

==Decision==

The commission declared the application inadmissible. Concerning [[Article 9 of the European Convention on Human Rights|Article 9]] of the [[European Convention on Human Rights|Convention]] ([[freedom of religion]]), it noted that ''the Commission does not exclude the possibility of criticism or 'agitation' against a church or religious group reaching such a level that it might endanger freedom of religion and where a tolerance of such behaviour by the authorities could engage State responsibility. However, the Commission does not consider that such an issue arises on the facts of the present case'' (Para. 5).

Concerning [[Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights | Article 6]] (access to court), the Commission reaffirmed that the right of an individual to protect his reputation can be regarded as a civil right protected by Article 6, but did not extend this protection to a group, when the national legislation didn't foresee that (Para. 19).

During the first session of the Council, they acted informally as an unnamed "study group" of individual Council fathers of traditionalist orientation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Roy | first = Philippe | publication-date = 2012 | title =  Le ''Coetus Internationalis Patrum'' au concile Vatican II: genèse d’une dissidence ? | journal = Histoire@Politique.

== Issues ==

As a member of the Preparatory Commission for the [[Second Vatican Council]], [[Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre]] had taken part in the discussions about the draft documents submitted to the bishops for consideration at the Council. His concerns with these proposals led to the formation of the study group to deal with a number of issues at the Council. A primary element of their agenda was opposition to the principle of episcopal [[Collegiality (Catholic Church)|collegiality]], which they feared could undermine [[Primacy of the Roman Pontiff|papal primacy]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Wrighton | first = Basil | year = 1984 | title = Collegiality: error of Vatican II ''(2)'' | publisher = Society of Saint Pius X (District of the USA) | publication-place = | url = http://www.sspx.org/en/collegiality-error-vatican-ii-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the rights of individual bishops.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Wilde | first = Melissa J. | year = 2004 | title = How Culture Mattered at Vatican II: Collegiality Trumps Authority in the Council's Social Movement Organizations | journal = American Sociological Review | volume = 69 | issue = 4 | pages = 582–583 | url = https://sociology.sas.upenn.edu/sites/sociology.sas.upenn.edu/files/Wilde%20How%20Culture%20Mattered%20at%20VII.pdf | doi=10.1177/000312240406900406}}&lt;/ref&gt; They thought there should be a specific condemnation of [[communism]]&lt;ref name = OMalley_Communism/&gt; and that there should be a separate Council document elevating the status of the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]], not merely a chapter in ''[[Lumen gentium]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Wilde | first = Melissa J. | year = 2004 | title = How Culture Mattered at Vatican II: Collegiality Trumps Authority in the Council's Social Movement Organizations | journal = American Sociological Review | volume = 69 | issue = 4 | pages = 594–596 | url = https://sociology.sas.upenn.edu/sites/sociology.sas.upenn.edu/files/Wilde%20How%20Culture%20Mattered%20at%20VII.pdf | doi=10.1177/000312240406900406}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Continuing complaints from the group about the presence of Protestant observers led Pope Paul VI, who was "concerned not to alienate the [[Traditionalist Catholic|traditionalists]]", to ask Cardinal [[Augustin Bea]] "if perhaps the presence of the 'separated brethren' and their 'mentality' were 'excessively dominating the council, thus diminishing its psychological freedom.' (He) emphasized that protecting 'the coherence of the teaching of the Catholic Church' was more important than pleasing the observers.'" After thus consulting Cardinal Bea, the Pope decided not to disinvite the observers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nationalcatholicreporter.org/word/word0131.htm Priest who was present at the start reviews bold ecumenical vision of Vatican II], John L Allen Jr, January 31, 2003, Word from Rome, [[National Catholic Reporter]]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Influence ==

Their influence on the outcome of the Council was decidedly mixed.  Their opposition to the principle of episcopal collegiality, and specifically to the granting of greater authority to conferences of bishops, made it difficult for them to work effectively with the national and regional bishops' conferences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Wilde | first = Melissa J. | year = 2004 | title = How Culture Mattered at Vatican II: Collegiality Trumps Authority in the Council's Social Movement Organizations | journal = American Sociological Review | volume = 69 | issue = 4 | pages = 577, 590–591 | url = https://sociology.sas.upenn.edu/sites/sociology.sas.upenn.edu/files/Wilde%20How%20Culture%20Mattered%20at%20VII.pdf | doi=10.1177/000312240406900406}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some have seen the Group's opposition to collegial decision-making also had an effect on their reluctance to achieve consensus by developing compromise positions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Wilde | first = Melissa J. | year = 2004 | title = How Culture Mattered at Vatican II: Collegiality Trumps Authority in the Council's Social Movement Organizations | journal = American Sociological Review | volume = 69 | issue = 4 | page = 599 | url = https://sociology.sas.upenn.edu/sites/sociology.sas.upenn.edu/files/Wilde%20How%20Culture%20Mattered%20at%20VII.pdf | doi=10.1177/000312240406900406}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They did, however, have more success using other channels.  The Group had many contacts in the [[Papal Curia]] who shared their traditionalist point of view, and in the early years of the Council they were effective in using these back channels to make their opinions known at the highest levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Roy | first = Philippe | publication-date = 2012 | title =  Le ''Coetus Internationalis Patrum'' au concile Vatican II: genèse d’une dissidence ? | journal = Histoire@Politique. Politique, culture, société | issue = 18 | publisher = Presses de Sciences Po (P.F.N.S.P.) | place = Paris | language = French | pages = 8 [49] | issn = 1954-3670 | url = http://www.cairn.info/load_pdf.php?ID_ARTICLE=HP_018_0042 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the later years of the Council, they produced an almost uninterrupted flood of ''modi'' (amendments) to the proposals before the Council.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Roy | first = Philippe | publication-date = 2012 | title =  Le ''Coetus Internationalis Patrum'' au concile Vatican II: genèse d’une dissidence ? | journal = Histoire@Politique.

On specific issues, they failed to defeat the constitution on the liturgy, which introduced the vernacular and gave greater authority to episcopal conferences, or the decree on ecumenism, which some say undermined the traditional belief that the Catholic Church was the unique path to salvation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Roy | first = Philippe | publication-date = 2012 | title =  Le ''Coetus Internationalis Patrum'' au concile Vatican II: genèse d’une dissidence ? | journal = Histoire@Politique.

Comprising about ten to fifteen per cent of the total population in Egypt, Coptic Orthodox Christians (usually referred to as [[Copts]]) rely on the many services of the Orthodox Church and its dogma. Because the Copts compromise a small percentage of the population, most live in remote areas around Egypt mostly in the Zabbaleen, a poverty stricken area located in the Mokattam Village, Assuit, Akhmim, Girgeh, Luxor, Kuft and Nagada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kamil |first=Jill |title=Coptic Egypt: History and Guide |year=1987 |publisher=American University in Cairo Press |location=Cairo |pages=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of their core belief, Copts practice and accept the “Seven Sacrament,” which are explained as channels in which believers receive the sanctifications of the Holy Spirit. In Greek, the word “Sacrament” translates to “mystery” and Copts use this term specifically because of the unexplainable absolution that may derive from it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Doctrine of the Orthodox Church: Worship and Sacraments |url=http://orthodoxinfo.com/general/doctrine3.aspx |work=Orthodox Info |publisher=Callistos Ware |accessdate=20 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Seven Sacraments are affirmed and derived by contemporary Orthodox Catechisms and textbooks. Although there are more than seven official Sacraments of the church, the Orthodox Confessions in the 17th century, endorsed by local councils against [[the Reformation]] such as Metrophanes Critopoulos in 1625, Peter Mogila in 1638 and Dostheos of Jerusalem in 1672, determined that there were seven important Sacraments to a spiritual life and the Orthodox Church accepted this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Doctrine of the Orthodox Church |url=http://orthodoxinfo.com/general/doctrine3.aspx|work=Orthodox Info|publisher=Callistoes Ware |accessdate=20 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Seven Sacraments are in order of: baptism, confirmation, repentance and confession, communion, matrimony, anointing of the sick, and priesthood.&lt;ref name="Kamilpp"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kamil|pages=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here, we will further examine the sixth Sacrament, ‘anointing of the sick’, but first we must briefly contextualize Orthodoxy in Egypt to understand the hierarchy of the Church among Egyptians in Egypt and worldwide.

== Background ==

Many Historians and Church Fathers suggest that there are two main reasons why Christian Egyptians live in secluded areas such as stated above. First, the social condition in which they face has pushed them in such isolated locations and second, among these areas reside Orthodox Churches. Living close to a Church is not only important to Copts but it is necessary. The Coptic Church in Egypt is not only a spiritual temple but also a central foundation for all resources. Amongst these resources, Jill Kamil explains in her book; Coptic Egypt: History and Guide, that there are over 150 Coptic organizations in Cairo alone, institutions including but not limited to: schools, orphanages, retirement homes, hospitals and social service centers, all run on Church grounds.&lt;ref name="Kamilpp" /&gt; With these exterior sources, Copts (along with Muslims) are permitted the opportunity to go to school and most importantly be a healthy enabled person. However, instead of thanking the Church for these services, Copts are more inclined to thank the grace of God for His work within the Church. Kamil further explains that for Egyptians a sense of the supernatural was, and remains, strong.&lt;ref name="Kamilpp_a"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kamil|pages=58}}&lt;/ref&gt; Copts believe in both miracles and an element of magic: miracles like visitations of Saint Mary or healing of the sick and magic like the efficacy of the Seven Sacraments.&lt;ref name="Kamilpp_a" /&gt;   
With the belief in both miracles and magic, Egyptians believe that their most unfortunate circumstance could be solved by God, as well as the patron of Saints that could intercede on the supplicant's behalf. In between the miracles and heavenly mysteries, Copts have an interesting perception on sickness and its execution as well as spiritual remedies. The next few sections will explain in great detail the spiritual rituals in which Copts partake in during the process of anointing and healing of the sick.

== The Role of the Spiritual Fathers ==
The Coptic Orthodox experience is accurately described when the congregation of the devout is gathered together in worship. Without that description, Alexander a-Malek explains in an article called Sacraments of the Church, that it becomes impossible to understand the fundamentals of Church structure in Orthodoxy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=A-Malek|first=Alexander|title=Sacraments of the Church|url=http://www.copticheritage.org/orthodoxy/sacraments_of_the_church|work=The Heritage of the Coptic Orthodox Church|accessdate=20 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A-Malek further explains that the practices of Orthodoxy have not changed much over the centuries like many other Christian communities in the world do.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=A-Malek|first=Alexander|title=Sacraments of the Church|url=http://www.copticheritage.org/orthodoxy/sacraments_of_the_church|work=The Heritage of the Coptic Orthodox|accessdate=20 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tradition has always played a very important role in how the Church performs its liturgies, baptisms, Sacraments, etc. Its important to note that within the Orthodox community, Copts believe that all humanity are equal under God, however, the fathers/priests have jurisdiction which normal lay men do not. Paul Evdokimov explains in his book Orthodoxy, that based on spiritual gifts and the order of their ministries, tradition makes clear distinction between the congregation and the Fathers of the Church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Evdokimov|first=Paul|title=Ages of the Spiritual Life|year=1998|publisher=St. Vladimir's Seminary Press|location=Crestwood|pages=172}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Sacrament means something secret or hidden, Evdokimov explains that the mysteries of Christ are hidden from the profane, even from the prophets, for Christ has communicated them only in parables.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Evdokimov|pages=271}}&lt;/ref&gt; The performance of a sacrament is also considered a mystery because while it is believed that God performs it, He does it through the action of a Priest.  The sacrament of Priesthood is considered to be an important and crucial duty. When elected, it is believed that the Father receives the Holy Spirit after an intense period of fasting, prayers and education. After ordination, the Priest is sent to a needed congregation and is given the authority to officiate the Sacraments of the Church.&lt;ref name="Mettaous 2000"&gt;{{cite book |last=Mettaous|first=H.H.|title=Sacramental Rites in the Coptic Orthodox Church|year=2000|publisher=St. Mina Monastery Press|location=Alexander}}&lt;/ref&gt; Egyptians are known to be pious people; Kamil explains that Copts depend on Priests to pray over certain situations in their lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kamil|pages=56}}&lt;/ref&gt; Situations vary but the frequent calling for priests are usually due to sickness or disease of a member.

== Healing of the Sick ==
Healing of the sick, which is also referred to as the “Unction”, is one of the divine mysteries belonging to the Orthodox belief, where the sick who are faithful become healed from psychological and/or physical illnesses. Carl S. Tyneh writes in Orthodox Christianity: Overview and Bibliography, that there are visible and invisible elements to thus sacrament. The visible elements are the oil, the prayer of the Church, the congregation and the actual performance of the anointing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Tyneh|first=Carl S.|title=Orthodox Christianity: Overview and Bibliography|year=2003|publisher=Nova Science Publishers|location=New York|pages=117}}&lt;/ref&gt; The invisible element is that where the Holy Spirit works to cure the sick. Tyneh explains however, that only if God permits will, will the sick be granted healing.&lt;ref name="Tynehpp"&gt;{{cite book |last=Tyneh|pages=117}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Orthodox Confession of Peter Mogila clarifies this point by noting; “it is not always good that the healing of the body should occur; nonetheless, the forgiveness of the soul’s sins always takes place with him who repents.”&lt;ref name="Tynehpp"/&gt;   Although some branches of Christianity only perform this unction to those who are fatally ill, Orthodoxy celebrates this mystery at any time even for minor illnesses. It is important to note that this sacrament is optional and not mandatory.&lt;ref name="Tynehpp"/&gt; Tyneh clarifies that participation are for those who desire and feel the need.&lt;ref name="Tynehpp" /&gt; However, it is strongly urged that the anointing of the sick is performed for the dying so that their soul be strengthened during their final struggle against death.&lt;ref name="Tynehpp"/&gt; The importance of this sacrament was stated by Saint James when he wrote in the Bible; “Is any sick among you? Let him call for the elders of the church; and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord: and the prayer of faith shall save the sick…”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Holy Bible|year=2000|publisher=New King James Version|pages=James 5, 14–15}}&lt;/ref&gt; With specific orders, this sacrament is commonly referred to as the sacrament of Kendeel, in Arabic that literally translates to the ‘Sacrament of Lamps’. This name was adopted because the early Christians used to place oil in a lamp, from which hung seven other lamps.&lt;ref name="Mettaous 2000"/&gt; Each lamp was then lit and followed with a specific prayer. This ritual still exists, however, the seven lamps are now replaced by seven wicks made out of cotton wool and sits in a plate of oil.&lt;ref name="Mettaous"&gt;{{cite book|last=Mettaous}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is then believed that the Holy Spirit sanctifies the oil in order to heal those anointed by it. However, before this sacrament could take place Bishop Mettaous explains that the sick must partake in confessions.&lt;ref name="Mettaous"/&gt; After a private confession, both the priest and their family members are gathered to attend the Sacrament of Unction to witness the diseased be anointed and prayed on. A full recovery is not usually expected immediately after service, the patient has to continue being devout and believe in God’s miracles. In the Orthodox Church, this sacrament can be administered to any baptized person; the Church does not have a special unction for larger cases.  It's important to note that throughout the Orthodox history, monasteries were among the first hospitals in Egypt and monks tended to treat the sick by providing the appropriate medication, as well as administering the Sacrament by praying for the diseased. This demonstrates that Orthodoxy does not condone Western medicine but suggests the balance of both human and spiritual healing. For example, St. Pachomious in his Koinonia II, 40, wrote: "If some sickness is alleged, the housemaster shall proceed to the minister of the sick and receive from them whatever medicine is necessary." A- Malek explains that although the Church does not discourage any believer from seeking proper medical attention, it is important to have God in their hearts as their only true Provider and Healer.&lt;ref name="MalekError"&gt;{{citation |last=A-Malek}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, medical alternatives are considered as tools but God is the one who fills and completes the medicine ministered by human.

== The Motivation ==
Daniel B. Clendenin affirms in his book, Eastern Orthodox Theology: A Contemporary Reader, that this Unction is not limited to the number of times one receives it; he goes in so far to say, “It should be used as medicine, whenever there is need.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Clendenin|first=Daniel B |title=Eastern Orthodox Theology: A Contemporary Reader|year=1995|publisher=Baker Books |location=Michigan|pages=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many explanations and reasons as to why Copts seek spiritual healing instead or in addition to medical practices. A-Malek explains that while the sixth sacrament is certainly practiced and healing may come from it, it should not replace the practices of Western medicine.&lt;ref name="MalekError"/&gt; It is argued that Copts seek spiritual healing from the Church for three main motives: First, as previously explained above, Egyptian Christians are devout, religious people and truly believe in God’s grace and miracles. Second, Egyptians are very traditional people and do not appreciate Western influence so many resort to using spiritual folk remedies. And finally, many Coptic Egyptians live in remote areas where doctors are inconvenient and are not affordable. From the beginning of time, Egyptian medicine contained a strong element of religious magic. From ancient civilization, Egypt acquired the first physician, [[Imhotep]], as well as the first medical textbook Ebers Papyrus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Barnum|first=Barbara Stevens|title=Spirituality in Nursing: From Traditional to New Age|year=1996|publisher=Springer Pub Co.|location=New York|pages=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; While offering prayers and sacrifices to religious deities, they also took preventive measures such as storing grain against future need. Researchers have also founded a school offering education to Egyptian physicians that dated as early as 1100 b.c.&lt;ref name="Barnumpp"&gt;{{cite book|last=Barnum|pages=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Here, a number of practical therapeutic remedies of care for the sick were developed and still exercised.&lt;ref name="Barnumpp" /&gt;   Since medicine has a long history in Egypt, Egyptians feel that there is no specific need to Western medicine. With this in mind, Egyptians still partake in traditional remedies and believe that religious powers are beyond the most influential. Other than tradition, most Egyptians view public health as a burden.  The Oxford Business Group provides essential information in The Report: Egypt 2010, and further identifies the overburden of the health system in Egypt. For example, making an appointment at a public clinic requires the patients to fill out a substantial amount of paperwork.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Report: Egypt 2010|year=2010|publisher=Oxford Business Group|location=Cairo|pages=118}}&lt;/ref&gt;   This is problematic for two main reasons: First lower-class citizens may be illiterate and not able to fill forms and most importantly, many Egyptians don’t have sufficient documentation or money to see a physician. Another key information that is presented is that the public health facilities are centered in urban areas – around two-thirds of facilities are located in Cairo and Alexandria.&lt;ref name="OxfordBusiness"&gt;{{cite book|publisher=Oxford Business Group|pages=118}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Of course, this benefits the wealthy patients since it is readily available to them and some may even receive private care more regularly than the less affluent.&lt;ref name="OxfordBusiness" /&gt;   “The population is very price-sensitive,” said Hazen Adlan, the medical director of Dar El Mona Hospital, “oftentimes if they can't afford care, they just don’t go to the doctor’s office,” he added.&lt;ref name="OxfordBusiness" /&gt;  These conditions along with many others push and motivate most Copts to rely on the Church for its consistent therapeutical and medical support. However, the most significant factor of Church reliance is the passing of folklores. Since there have been many stories of healings, Egyptians pass certain traditions and stories among their friends and families. In recent time, a 
Priest named Father Makary Younan has performed many spiritual healings in his church Saint Mary and Saint Makar in Oleya. Although he’s widely recognized for his excursions of exorcism, Father Makary has also provided instant healing among Christians and Muslims. His performance started with a small crowd and by word of mouth and many success stories later, the Church is now surrounded by thousands people every Thursday as he performs the Sacrament of healing to hundreds of people within the society and worldwide.

==Early life and education==
Brooks was born in Toronto, [[Ontario]], where his father was working on a PhD, and spent his early years in the middle-income [[Stuyvesant Town]] housing development in [[Lower Manhattan]]. His father taught English literature at [[New York University]], while his mother studied nineteenth-century British history at [[Columbia University]]. Brooks is Jewish but rarely attends synagogue.&lt;ref name="chicagomag_interview"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Felsenthal|first1=Carol|title=David Brooks Doesn't Pay Attention to Your Criticism|url=http://www.chicagomag.com/Chicago-Magazine/Felsenthal-Files/May-2015/David-Brooks/|accessdate=February 14, 2016|date=May 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="weeklystandard2003"&gt;[http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/002/268jlqme.asp It's Back], ''[[The Weekly Standard]]'', February 20, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimes1"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/17/opinion/17brooks.html?_r=1 A Loud and Promised Land], ''[[The New York Times]]'', April 16, 2009. "As an American Jew, I was taught to go all gooey-eyed at the thought of Israel ..."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Beam 2010"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Beam|first1=Christopher|title=A Reasonable Man|url=http://nymag.com/news/media/67010/index5.html#print|website=[[New York magazine]]|date=Jul 4, 2010|accessdate=November 14, 2014|quote=His wife is devoutly Jewish—she converted after they married and recently changed her name from Jane Hughes to the more biblical-sounding Sarah Brooks—but he rarely attends synagogue.}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a young child, Brooks attended the [[Grace Church School]], an independent [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal]] primary school in [[Greenwich Village]]. When he was 12, his family moved to the [[Philadelphia Main Line]], the affluent suburbs of Philadelphia. He graduated from [[Radnor High School]] in 1979. In 1983, Brooks graduated from the [[University of Chicago]] with a degree in history.&lt;ref name="pbsbio"/&gt; His senior thesis was on popular science writer [[Robert Ardrey]].&lt;ref name="Beam 2010" /&gt;

As an undergraduate, Brooks frequently contributed reviews and satirical pieces to campus publications. His senior year, he wrote a spoof of the lifestyle of wealthy conservative [[William F. Buckley Jr.]], who was scheduled to speak at the university: "In the afternoons he is in the habit of going into crowded rooms and making everybody else feel inferior. The evenings are reserved for extended bouts of name-dropping."&lt;ref&gt;University of Chicago ''Maroon'', April 5, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt; To his piece, Brooks appended the note: "Some would say I'm envious of Mr. Buckley. But if truth be known, I just want a job and have a peculiar way of asking. So how about it, Billy? Can you spare a dime?" When Buckley arrived to give his talk, he asked whether Brooks was in the lecture audience and offered him a job.&lt;ref&gt;[http://magazine.uchicago.edu/0402/features/index-brooks.shtml "Everybody's a Critic", Mary Ruth Yoe, ''University of Chicago Magazine''(February, 2004).]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early career==
Upon graduation, Brooks became a police reporter for the [[City News Bureau of Chicago]], a wire service owned jointly by the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' and ''[[Chicago Sun Times]]''.&lt;ref name="pbsbio" /&gt; He says that his experience on Chicago's crime beat had a conservatizing influence on him&lt;ref name="Beam 2010" /&gt; In 1984, mindful of the offer he had received from Buckley, Brooks applied and was accepted as an intern at Buckley's ''[[National Review]]''. According to Christopher Beam, the internship included an all-access pass to the affluent lifestyle that Brooks had previously mocked, including yachting expeditions, Bach concerts, dinners at Buckley's [[Park Avenue]] apartment and villa in [[Stamford, Connecticut]], and a constant stream of writers, politicians, and celebrities.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Brooks was an outsider in more ways than his relative inexperience. ''National Review'' was a Catholic magazine, and Brooks is not Catholic. [[Sam Tanenhaus]] later reported in ''The New Republic'' that Buckley might have eventually named Brooks his successor if it hadn't been for his being Jewish. "If true, it would be upsetting," Brooks says.&lt;ref name="Beam 2010" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After his internship with Buckley ended, Brooks spent some time at the conservative [[Hoover Institution]] at [[Stanford University]] and then got a job writing movie reviews for ''[[The Washington Times]]''.

==Career==
[[File:PBS-Rehearsal-David Brooks.jpg|thumb|Brooks and PBS staff at rehearsal for ''[[PBS Newshour]]'' in 2012.]]
In 1986, Brooks was hired by ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', where he worked first as an editor of the book review section, enlisting [[William Kristol]] to review [[Allan Bloom]]'s ''[[The Closing of the American Mind]]'', which helped raise the book to national prominence. He also filled in for five months as a movie critic. From 1990–94, ''The Wall Street Journal'' posted Brooks as an op-ed columnist to [[Brussels]], where he covered Russia (making numerous trips to Moscow); the Middle East; South Africa; and European affairs. On his return, Brooks joined the neo-conservative ''[[Weekly Standard]]'' when it was launched in 1994. In 1996, he edited an anthology, ''Backward and Upward: The New Conservative Writing.''&lt;ref name="pbsbio" /&gt;&lt;ref name="nytbio" /&gt;

In 2000, Brooks published a book of cultural commentary titled ''[[Bobos in Paradise|Bobos in Paradise: The New Upper Class and How They Got There]]'' to considerable acclaim. The book, a [[paean]] to consumerism, argued that the new managerial or "new upper class" represents a marriage between the liberal idealism of the 1960s and the self-interest of the 1980s.

According to a 2010 article in ''New York Magazine'' written by Christopher Beam, ''New York Times'' editorial-page editor [[Gail Collins]] called Brooks in 2003 and invited him to lunch.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Collins was looking for a conservative to replace outgoing columnist [[William Safire]], but one who understood how liberals think. "I was looking for the kind of conservative writer that wouldn't make our readers shriek and throw the paper out the window," says Collins. "He was perfect." Brooks started writing in September 2003. "The first six months were miserable," Brooks says. "I'd never been hated on a mass scale before."&lt;ref name="Beam 2010" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 2004, Brooks' book ''[[On Paradise Drive: How We Live Now (And Always Have) in the Future Tense]]'' was published as a sequel to his 2000 best seller, ''Bobos in Paradise'', but it was not as well received as its predecessor. Brooks is also the volume editor of ''The Best American Essays'' (publication date October 2, 2012), and authored [[The Social Animal (David Brooks book)|''The Social Animal: The Hidden Sources of Love, Character and Achievement'']].&lt;ref name='socialanimal' &gt;[http://www.randomhouse.com/catalog/display.pperl?isbn=9781400067602 Random House website] The Social Animal: The Hidden Sources of Love, Character and Achievement.&lt;/ref&gt; The book was excerpted in ''The New Yorker'' magazine in January 2011&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Brooks describes himself as having originally been a [[Modern American liberalism|liberal]] before, as he put it, "coming to my senses."

On August 10, 2006, Brooks wrote a column for ''The New York Times'' titled "Party No. 3". The column imagined a moderate [[John McCain|McCain]]-[[Joe Lieberman|Lieberman]] Party in opposition to both [[Two-party system|major parties]], which he perceived as [[Polarization (politics)|polarized]] and beholden to [[special interests]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=David | last=Brooks | title=Party No. 3 | date=August 10, 2006 | work=New York Times | p=A23 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/10/opinion/10brooks.html | accessdate=October 13, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a March 2007, article published in ''The New York Times'' titled "No U-Turns",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=No U-Turns|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/29/opinion/29brooks.html?_r=1&amp;hp&amp;oref=slogin|website=The New York Times|date=March 3, 2007 |last=Brooks|first=David|accessdate=September 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brooks explained that the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] must distance itself from the minimal-government conservative principles that had arisen during the [[Barry Goldwater]] and [[Ronald Reagan]] eras. He claims that these core concepts had served their purposes and should no longer be embraced by Republicans in order to win elections. [[Alex Pareene]] commented that Brooks "has been trying for so long to imagine a sensible Republican Party into existence that he can't still think it's going to happen soon."&lt;ref name="Blow up the Times Op-Ed page, and start again!"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pareene|first1=Alex|title=Blow up the Times Op-Ed page, and start again!|url=http://www.salon.com/2014/04/22/blow_up_the_times_op_ed_page_and_start_again_why_friedman_brooks_and_dowd_must_go/|website=Salon|accessdate=August 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brooks has frequently expressed admiration for President [[Barack Obama]]. In an August 2009, profile of Brooks, ''[[The New Republic]]'' describes his first encounter with Obama, in the spring of 2005: "Usually when I talk to senators, while they may know a policy area better than me, they generally don't know political philosophy better than me. I got the sense he knew ''both'' better than me. ... I remember distinctly an image of – we were sitting on his couches, and I was looking at his pant leg and his perfectly creased pant, and I'm thinking, a) he's going to be president and b) he'll be a very good president."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Sherman |first=Gabriel |title=The Courtship: The story behind the Obama-Brooks bromance |website=[[The New Republic]] |url=http://www.tnr.com/article/politics/the-courtship |date=August 31, 2009 |accessdate=September 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brooks appreciates that Obama thinks "like a writer", explaining, "He's a very writerly personality, a little aloof, exasperated. He's calm. He's not addicted to people."&lt;ref name="chicago maroon"/&gt; Two days after Obama's second autobiography, ''[[The Audacity of Hope]]'', hit bookstores, Brooks published a column in ''The New York Times'', titled "Run, Barack, Run", urging the Chicago politician to run for president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=David |last=Brooks |title=Run, Barack, Run |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/19/opinion/19brooks.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=October 19, 2006 |accessdate=September 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in December 2011, during a C-SPAN interview, Brooks expressed a more tempered opinion of Obama's presidency, giving Obama only a "B-", and saying that Obama's chances of re-election would be less than 50–50 if elections were held at that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=''In Depth'' with David Brooks|url=http://www.c-span.org/video/?302718-1/depth-david-brooks|publisher=[[C-SPAN]]|accessdate=April 25, 2015|date=December 4, 2011|quote=Host: So how is the president doing?

I was a little disappointed in the way the [[National debt of the United States|debt]] has run up, and I don't blame him for running up the debt in the [[Recession of 2008|recession]], but I think we needed an exit strategy to get out of it. I think he could have done a little more to promote [[Economic growth|growth]], though I think given all the bad things it was going to be tough no matter who was president, no matter who did anything, it was going to be tough to promote growth. So I don't particularly blame him for that. I think he's conducted himself in pretty much an honest way. He's had very little [[Corruption in the United States|corruption]]. I still have great personal admiration for him. I'm more to his [[Conservatism in the United States|right]], but I give him no worse than a B-. I think he's made some mistakes, but i wouldn't say he's been a bad president.}}&lt;/ref&gt; He stated, "I don't think he's integrated himself with people in Washington as much as he should have."&lt;ref name="chicago maroon"/&gt; However, in a February 2016 ''New York Times'' op-ed, Brooks admitted that he missed Obama during the 2016 primary season, admiring the president's "integrity" and "humanity" among other characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/09/opinion/i-miss-barack-obama.html|title=I Miss Barack Obama|date=February 9, 2016|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In writing for ''The New York Times'' in January 2010, Brooks described Israel as "an astonishing success story".&lt;ref name=tel&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/12/opinion/12brooks.html | work=The New York Times | title=The Tel Aviv Cluster | first=David | last=Brooks | date=January 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote that "Jews are a famously accomplished group," who, because they were "forced to give up farming in the Middle Ages ... have been living off their wits ever since".&lt;ref name=tel /&gt; In Brooks' view, "Israel's technological success is the fruition of the [[Zionist]] dream. The country was not founded so stray [[Israeli settlements|settlers]] could sit among thousands of angry Palestinians in [[Hebron]]. It was founded so Jews would have a safe place to come together and create things for the world."&lt;ref name=tel /&gt;&lt;ref name="David Brooks Was Right: Anti-Semitism Is a Different Evil"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Maltz Bovy|first1=Phoebe|title=David Brooks Was Right: Anti-Semitism Is a Different Evil|url=https://newrepublic.com/article/121372/david-brooks-nyt-column-anti-semitism-wasnt-entirely-wrong|website=The New Republic|accessdate=August 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Brooks issued his commentary on poverty reform in the United States. His op-ed in ''The New York Times''  titled "The Nature of Poverty" specifically followed the social uproar caused by the death of [[Death of Freddie Gray|Freddie Gray]], and concluded that federal spending is not the issue impeding the progress of poverty reforms, but rather that the impediments to upward mobility are "matters of [[social psychology]]".&lt;ref name="nytpoverty"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/01/opinion/david-brooks-the-nature-of-poverty.html|title=The Nature of Poverty|last=Brooks|first=David|date=May 1, 2015|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; When discussing Gray in particular, Brooks claimed that Gray as a young man was "not on the path to upward mobility".&lt;ref name="nytpoverty" /&gt;

In regard to the 2016 election, Brooks spoke in support of [[Hillary Clinton]], applauding her ability to be "competent" and "normal" in comparison to her Republican counterpart, [[Donald Trump]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2016/06/11/david_brooks_people_will_be_sick_of_trump_and_vote_for_hillary_she_will_be_competent_and_normal.html|title=David Brooks: People Will Be Sick Of Trump And Vote For Hillary, "She Will be Competent And Normal"|last=Schwartz|first=Ian|date=June 11, 2016|work=|access-date=September 20, 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;PBS News Hour. "Shields and Brooks on 'anticlimactic' Clinton victory, Trump's 'moral chasm'." Online video clip. YouTube. YouTube, 10 June 2016. Web. 20 September 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Brooks noted that he believed Clinton would eventually be victorious in the election, as he foresaw that the general American public would become "sick of" Trump.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

When discussing the political emergence of Trump, Brooks has been strong in his critiques of the candidate, most notably by authoring a ''New York Times'' op-ed he titled "No, Not Trump, Not Ever". In this piece, Brooks attacked Trump by arguing he is "epically unprepared to be president" and by pointing out Trump's "steady obliviousness to accuracy".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/18/opinion/no-not-trump-not-ever.html|title=No, Not Trump, Not Ever|last=Brooks|first=David|date=18 March 2016|work=The New York Times|access-date=20 September 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social views==
Brooks opposes what he sees as self-destructive behavior, such as the prevalence of teenage sex and [[divorce]]. His view is that "sex is more explicit everywhere barring real life. As the entertainment media have become more sex-saturated, American teenagers have become more sexually abstemious" by "waiting longer to have sex ... [and] having fewer partners". He sees the culture war as nearly over, because "today's young people ... seem happy with the frankness of the left and the wholesomeness of the right." As a result, he is optimistic about the United States' social stability, which he considers to be "in the middle of an amazing moment of improvement and repair".&lt;ref&gt;''The New York Times'', April 17, 2005, 4-14&lt;/ref&gt;

As early as 2003, Brooks wrote favorably of [[same-sex marriage]], pointing out that marriage is a traditional conservative value. Rather than opposing it, he wrote: "We should insist on gay marriage. We should regard it as scandalous that two people could claim to love each other and not want to sanctify their love with marriage and fidelity ... It's going to be up to conservatives to make the important, moral case for marriage, including gay marriage."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last1=Brooks | first1=David | title=The Power Of Marriage | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/11/22/opinion/the-power-of-marriage.html | date=November 22, 2003 | website=The New York Times | accessdate=May 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brooks also takes a moderate position on abortion, which he thinks should be legal, but with parental consent for minors, during the first four or five months, and illegal afterward, except in extremely rare circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=David |last=Brooks |title=Postures in Public, Facts in the Womb |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0DE6D9163EF931A15757C0A9619C8B63 |newspaper=The New York Times |date=April 22, 2007 |accessdate=December 31, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the legalization of drugs, he has expressed opposition to the liberalization of marijuana, advocating that it encourages morally reprovable behavior. Brooks relates that he smoked it in his youth but quit after a humiliating incident: Brooks smoked marijuana during lunch hour at school and felt embarrassed during a class presentation that afternoon in which he says he was incapable of intelligible speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/03/opinion/brooks-weed-been-there-done-that.html?hp&amp;rref=opinion&amp;_r=0 | work=The New York Times | first=David | last=Brooks | title=Weed: Been There. Done That | date=January 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==
Brooks' writing on sociology has been criticized for being based on [[stereotype]]s and presenting false claims as factual.&lt;ref name="David Brooks Has Some Notions About the Programs on Your Television Machine"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Scocca|first1=Tom|title=David Brooks Has Some Notions About the Programs on Your Television Machine|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/scocca/2010/10/22/david_brooks_has_some_notions_about_the_programs_on_your_television_machine.html|website=Slate|accessdate=August 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="David Brooks Is Nostalgic for a World Without Himself in It"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Scocca|first1=Tom|title=David Brooks Is Nostalgic for a World Without Himself in It|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/scocca/2011/03/14/david_brooks_is_nostalgic_for_a_world_without_himself_in_it.html|website=Slate|accessdate=August 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, [[Sasha Issenberg]], writing for ''[[Philadelphia magazine|Philadelphia]]'' magazine, fact-checked ''Bobos in Paradise'', concluding that many of its comments about [[Middle America (United States)|middle America]] were misleading or the exact reverse of the truth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Issenberg|first1=Sasha|title=Boo-Boos in Paradise|url=http://www.phillymag.com/articles/booboos-in-paradise/|website=Philadelphia magazine|accessdate=November 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He reported Brooks as insisting that the book was not intended to be factual but to report his impressions of what he believed an area to be like: "He laughed ... '[The book was] partially tongue-in-cheek' ... I went through some of the other instances where he made declarations that appeared insupportable. He accused me of being 'too pedantic,' of 'taking all of this too literally,' of 'taking a joke and distorting it.' 'That's totally unethical', he said." Brooks later said the article made him feel that "I ''suck'' ... I can't remember what I said but my mother told me I was extremely stupid."&lt;ref name="Beam 2010" /&gt; In 2015, ''[[Salon (website)|Salon]]'' found that Brooks had got "nearly every detail" wrong about a poll of high-school students.&lt;ref name="The facts vs. David Brooks: Startling inaccuracies raise questions about his latest book"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Zweig|first1=David|title=The facts vs. David Brooks: Startling inaccuracies raise questions about his latest book|url=http://www.salon.com/2015/06/15/the_facts_vs_david_brooks_startling_inaccuracies_raise_questions_about_his_latest_book/|website=Salon|accessdate=August 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Michael Kinsley]] argued that Brooks was guilty of "fearless generalizing ... Brooks does not let the sociology get in the way of the shtick, and he wields a mean shoehorn when he needs the theory to fit the joke".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kinsley|first1=Michael|title=Suburban Thrall|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/23/books/suburban-thrall.html|website=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=November 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing for ''[[Gawker Media|Gawker]]'', which consistently criticized Brooks' work, opinion writer Tom Scocca argued that Brooks does not use facts and statistics to support his policy positions, noting "possibly that is because he perceives facts and statistics as an opportunity for dishonest people to work mischief".&lt;ref name="David Brooks Has Noticed Hillary Is a Soviet Dictator"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Scocca |first1=Tom |title=David Brooks Has Noticed Hillary Is a Soviet Dictator |url=http://gawker.com/neutral-observer-david-brooks-has-noticed-hillary-is-a-1717779151 |website=Gawker |accessdate=August 15, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150815094043/http://gawker.com/neutral-observer-david-brooks-has-noticed-hillary-is-a-1717779151 |archivedate=August 15, 2015 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, [[Annie Lowrey]], in writing for the ''[[New York (magazine)|New York Magazine]]'', criticized Brooks' statistical methods when arguing his stance on political reform, claiming he used "some very tricksy, misleading math".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2015/05/david-brooks-is-not-buying-it-poor-people.html|title=David Brooks Is Not Buying Your Excuses, Poor People|last=Lowery|first=Annie|date=1 May 2015|website=New York Magazine|publisher=|access-date=20 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, Sean Illing of ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' criticized the same article from Brooks, claiming he argued his point by framing his sources' arguments out of context and routinely making bold "half-right" assumptions regarding the controversial issue of poverty reform.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/05/david_brooks_shouldn_t_talk_about_the_poor_the_new_york_times_columnist.html|title=Why David Brooks Shouldn't Talk About Poor People|last=Illing|first=Sean|date=1 May 2015|website=Slate|publisher=|access-date=20 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[http://althouse.blogspot.com/2016/01/the-best-conservatism-balances-support.html?m=1 "Althouse"] (January 13, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; Brooks was previously criticized by [[Lyle Denniston]] with regard to another case, for having "scrambled the actual significance of what the Supreme Court has done".&lt;ref&gt;[[Lyle Denniston|Denniston, Lyle]]. [http://blog.constitutioncenter.org/2012/03/constitution-check-did-the-supreme-court-give-us-super-pacs/ "Constitution Check: Did the Supreme Court give us Super PACs?"], ''Constitution Daily'' (May 7, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==

===Sidney Awards===
{{About|the Sidney Awards given each December by David Brooks|the award presented by the The Sidney Hillman Foundation|The Sidney Award}}
In 2004 Brooks created an award to honor the best political and cultural journalism of the year. Named for philosopher [[Sidney Hook]] and originally called "The Hookies", the honor was renamed "The Sidney Awards" in 2005. The awards are presented each December.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =Brooks | first =David | title =The Sidney Awards, 2005 | newspaper =The New York Times | date =December 29, 2005 | url =https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0DE2DC1330F93AA15751C1A9639C8B63 | accessdate = December 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Dumalla''' or full name '''Chand Tora Dumalla''' is the style of [[turban]] generally worn by [[Nihang]] [[Khalsa]] [[Sikh]]s. This is a [[warrior]] style turban which was worn by Sikhs in battle.
The "Chand Tora" is a metal symbol consisting of a crescent sword and a double edged sword, it is held in place at the front of the turban by a woven [[chainmail]] cord tied in a pattern within the turban to protect the head from slashing weapons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Guides|first1=Insight|title=Insight Guides: India|date=2013|publisher=APA|location=London|isbn=1-78005-687-7|edition=Tenth|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fKsxBgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PT302&amp;dq=Dumalla&amp;pg=PT302#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ferdinand Christian Baur''' (21 June 1792 – December 1860) was a [[Germany|German]] Protestant theologian and founder and leader of the (new) '''Tübingen School of [[theology]]''' (named for the [[University of Tübingen]] where Baur studied and taught). Following [[Hegel]]'s theory of [[dialectic]], Baur argued that [[Early Christianity|second century Christianity]] represented the synthesis of two opposing theses: [[Jewish Christian]]ity (Petrine Christianity) and Gentile Christianity ([[Pauline Christianity]]). This and the rest of Baur's work had a profound impact upon [[higher criticism]] of biblical and related texts.

[[Adolf Hilgenfeld]] followed Baur's lead and edited the Tübingen School's journal, though he was less radical than Baur.&lt;ref&gt;"Hilgenfeld, Adolf" and "Tübingen School." Cross, F. L., ed. The Oxford dictionary of the Christian church. New York: Oxford University Press. 2005&lt;/ref&gt; A patristic scholar and philosopher at Tübingen, [[Albert Schwegler]], gave the School's theories their most vigorous expression.&lt;ref&gt;"Schwegler, Albert" and "Tübingen School." Cross, F. L., ed. The Oxford dictionary of the Christian church. New York: Oxford University Press. 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The School's influence peaked in the 1840s, but was waning by the early twentieth century.&lt;ref name="Cross"&gt;"Tübingen School." Cross, F. L., ed. The Oxford dictionary of the Christian church. New York: Oxford University Press. 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Baur's views were revolutionary, but "one thing is certain: New Testament study, since his time, has had a different colour" (H.S. Nash). He had a number of followers, who in many cases modified his positions, and the groundwork laid by Baur continues to be built upon in the twenty-first century.

==Early years==
Baur was born at [[Schmiden]], near [[Cannstatt]].  After training at the theological seminary of [[Blaubeuren]], he went in 1809 to the [[University of Tübingen]]. Here he studied for a time under [[Ernst Bengel]], grandson of the eminent [[New Testament]] [[critic]], [[Johann Albrecht Bengel]], and at this early stage in his career he seems to have been under the influence of the old Tübingen School. But at the same time the philosophers [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]] and [[Friedrich Schelling]] were creating a wide and deep impression. In 1817 Baur returned to the [[Evangelical Seminaries of Maulbronn and Blaubeuren|theological seminary at Blaubeuren]] as professor. This move marked a turning-point in his life, for he now set to work on the investigations on which his reputation rests. He had already, in 1817, written a review of [[Gottlieb Philipp Christian Kaiser|G. Kaiser]]'s ''Biblische Theologie'' for Bengel's ''Archiv für Theologie'' (ii. 656); its tone was moderate and conservative.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

==Early works==
When, a few years after his appointment at Blaubeuren, he published his first important work, ''Symbolik und Mythologie oder die Naturreligion des Altertums'' ("Symbol and mythology: the natural religion of Antiquity", 1824–1825), it became evident that he had made a deeper study of [[philosophy]], and had come under the influence of Schelling and more particularly of [[Friedrich Daniel Ernst Schleiermacher|Friedrich Schleiermacher]]. The learning of the work was fully recognized, and in 1826 the author was called to Tübingen as professor of theology. It is with Tübingen that his greatest literary achievements are associated. His earlier publications here treated of [[mythology]] and the history of [[dogma]]. ''Das manichäische Religionssystem'' ("The [[Manichaeism|Manichaean]] religious system") appeared in 1831, ''[[Apollonius of Tyana|Apollonius von Tyana]]'' in 1832, ''Die christliche Gnosis'' ("Christian [[Gnosis]]") in 1835, and ''Über das Christliche im Platonismus oder Socrates und Christus'' ("On Christianity in Platonism: Socrates and Christ") in 1837. As [[Otto Pfleiderer]] (Pflederer 1890 p.&amp;nbsp;285) observes, "the choice not less than the treatment of these subjects is indicative of the large breadth of view and the insight of the historian into the [[Comparative religion|comparative history of religion]]."{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

==Simon Magus and Paul==
[[File:FerdinandChristianBaur.jpg|thumb|Ferdinand Christian Baur]]
Ferdinand Christian Baur, the founder of the "Tübingen School" of New Testament criticism, rested his ideas about the New Testament on the Clementines, and his ideas about the Clementines on St. Epiphanius, who found the writings used by an [[Ebionite]] sect in the 4th century. This Judeo-Christian sect at that date rejected St. Paul as an apostate. It was assumed that this 4th century opinion represented the Christianity of the Twelve Apostles; Paulinism was originally a heresy, and a schism from the Jewish Christianity of James and Peter and the rest; [[Marcion]] was a leader of the Pauline sect in its survival in the 2nd century, using only the Pauline Gospel, St. Luke (in its original form), and the Epistles of St. Paul (without the Pastoral Epistles). The Clementine literature had its first origin in the Apostolic Age, and belonged to the original Jewish, Petrine, legal Church. It is directed wholly against St. Paul and his sect. [[Simon Magus]] never existed; it is a nickname for St. Paul. The Acts of the Apostles, compiled in the 2nd century, have borrowed their mention of Simon from the earliest form of the Clementines. Catholicism under the presidency of Rome was the result of the adjustment between the Petrine and Pauline sections of the Church in the second half of the 2nd century. The Fourth Gospel is a monument of this reconciliation, in which Rome took a leading part, having invented the fiction that both Peter and Paul were the founders of her Church, both having been martyred at Rome, and on the same day, in perfect union.

Throughout the middle of the 19th century this theory, in many forms, was dominant in Germany. The demonstration, mainly by English scholars, of the impossibility of the late dates ascribed to the New Testament documents (four Epistles of St. Paul and the Apocalypse were the only documents generally admitted as being of early date), and the proofs of the authenticity of the Apostolic Fathers and of the use of St. John's Gospel by Justin, Papias, and Ignatius, gradually brought Baur's theories into discredit. Of the original school, [[Adolf Hilgenfeld]] may be considered the last survivor (died 1907). He was induced to admit that Simon Magus was a real personage, though he persisted that in the Clementines he is meant for St. Paul. In 1847 Hilgenfeld dated the original nucleus (Kerygmata Petrou) soon after the Jewish war of 70; successive revisions of it were anti-Basilidian, anti-Valentinian, and anti-Marcionite respectively. Baur placed the completed form, ‘‘H’’, soon after the middle of the 2nd century, and Schliemann (1844) agreed, placing ‘‘R’’, as a revision, between 211 and 230. Other writers dated both ‘‘H’’ and ‘‘R’’ to between the 2nd and 4th centuries:

* R. 2nd century: [[Sixtus Senensis]] (Sixtus of Siena) (1520-1569), David Blondel (David Blondellus Catalaunensis) (1590-1655), [[Jean-Baptiste Cotelier]] (1629-1686), [[William Cave]] (1637-1713), Casimir Oudin (1638-1717), [[Noël Alexandre]] (Natalis Alexander) (1639-1724), [[Denis-Nicolas Le Nourry]] (Nourri) (1647-1724), Johann Georg Heinsius (d. 1733), [[Ernst Friedrich Karl Rosenmüller]] (1768-1835), Christian Wilhelm Flügge (1773-1828), [[Karl Gottlieb Bretschneider]] (1776-1848), [[Johann Georg Veit Engelhardt]] (1791-1855), [[Johann Karl Ludwig Gieseler]] (1792-1854), [[Friedrich August Gottreu Tholuck]] (1799-1877), and [[August Friedrich Gfrörer]] (1803-1861).
* R. 2nd or 3rd century: Schröck, Stark, Lumper, Krabbe, Locherer, Gersdorf.
* R. 3rd century: Strunzius (on Bardesanes, 1710), Weismann (17l8), Mosheim, Kleuker, Schmidt (Kirchengesch.)
* R. 4th century: Corrodi, Lentz (Dogmengesch.).
* H. 2nd century (beginning): Credner, Bretschneider, Kern, Rothe.
* H. 2nd century: Clericus, Beausobre, Flügge, Münscher, Hoffmann, Döllinger, Hilgers; (middle of 2nd) Hase.
* H. end of 2nd century: Schröck, Cölln, Gieseler (3rd ed.), Schenkel, Gfrörer, Lücke.
* H. 3rd century: Mill, Mosheim, [[Gallandi]], Gieseler (2nd ed.).
* H. 2nd or 3rd century: Neander, Krabbe, Baur, Ritter, Paniel, Dähne.
* H. 4th century: Lentz.

==Hegel's influence==
Meantime Baur had exchanged one master in philosophy for another, Schleiermacher for [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]]. In doing so, he had adopted completely the Hegelian philosophy of history. "Without philosophy," he has said, "history is always for me dead and dumb." The change of view is illustrated clearly in the essay, published in the ''Tübinger Zeitschrift'' for 1831, on the Christ-party in the [[Apollos|Corinthian Church]], ''Die Christuspartei in der korinthischen Gemeinde, der Gegensatz des paulinischen und petrinischen Christentums in der ältesten Kirche, der Apostel Petrus in Rom'', the trend of which is suggested by the title (in English, 'The Christ Party in the Corinthian Community, the Opposition of Pauline and Petrine Christianity in the earliest Church, the apostle Peter in Rome'). Baur contends that the apostle [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]] was opposed in [[Corinth]] by a [[Jewish Christian]] party that wished to set up its own form of Christian religion instead of his universal Christianity. He found traces of a keen conflict of parties in the post-apostolic age, which have passed into the mainstream of [[Early Christian]] historiography.

==Pauline epistles==
{{see also|Paul of Tarsus and Judaism}}

The theory is further developed in a later work (1835, the year in which [[David Strauss]]' ''Leben Jesu'' was published), ''Über die sogenannten Pastoralbriefe''. In this Baur attempts to prove that the false teachers mentioned in the [[Second Epistle to Timothy]] and [[Epistle to Titus]] are the [[Gnosticism|Gnostics]], particularly the [[Marcion]]ites, of the 2nd century, and consequently that the Pastoral Epistles were produced in the middle of the 2nd century in opposition to Gnosticism.

He next proceeded to investigate other [[Pauline epistles]] and the ''[[Acts of the Apostles]]'' in the same manner, publishing his results in 1845 under the title ''Paulus, der Apostel Jesu Christi, sein Leben und Wirken, seine Briefe und seine Lehre''. In this he contends that only the [[Epistle to the Galatians]], [[First Epistle to the Corinthians|First]] and [[Second Epistle to the Corinthians]] and [[Epistle to the Romans]] are genuinely Pauline, and that the Paul of the [[Acts of the Apostles]] is a different person from the Paul of these genuine Epistles, the author being a Paulinist who, with an eye to the different parties in the Church, is at pains to represent Peter as far as possible as a [[Pauline Christianity|Paulinist]] and Paul as far as possible as a [[Primacy of Simon Peter|Petrinist]].

==Early Christian conflicts==
{{rquote|right|We are rich in our Christian faith, we become poor if we enter into a compromise with anti-Trinitarianism in any form. F. C. Baur, the father of the Tubingen School, who cannot be accused of being a friend of traditional orthodoxy, was correct in his statement that Christianity would have lost its character as the universal religion of mankind if Arianism had been triumphant at Nicea.|[[s:Modern Anti-Trinitarianism and Islam|Modern Anti-Trinitarianism and Islam]], 1912}}
Baur was prepared to apply his theory to the whole of the [[New Testament]]; in the words of [[H. S. Nash]], "he carried a sweeping hypothesis into the examination of the New Testament." He considers those writings alone genuine in which the conflict between Jewish-Christians and Gentile-Christians is clearly marked. In his ''Kritische Untersuchungen über die kanonischen Evangelien, ihr Verhältniss zu einander, ihren Charakter und Ursprung'' (1847) he turns his attention to the Gospels, and here again finds that the authors were conscious of the conflict of parties; the Gospels reveal a mediating or conciliatory tendency (''Tendenz'') on the part of the writers or redactors. The Gospels, in fact, are adaptations or redactions of an older Gospel, such as the [[Gospel of the Hebrews]], [[Gospel of Peter|of Peter]], [[Greek Gospel of the Egyptians|of the Egyptians]], or [[Gospel of the Ebionites|of the Ebionites]]. The Petrine [[Matthew the Evangelist|Matthew]] bears the closest relationship to this original Gospel (''Urevangelium''); the Pauline [[Luke the Evangelist|Luke]] is later and arose independently; Mark represents a still later development according to Baur; the account in John is idealistic: it "does not possess historical truth, and cannot and does not really lay claim to it."

Baur's theory starts with the supposition that Christianity was gradually developed out of [[Judaism]], see also [[List of events in early Christianity]]. Before it could become a universal religion, it had to struggle with Jewish limitations and to overcome them. The early Christians were Jewish-Christians, to whom Jesus was the [[Messiah]]. Paul, on the other hand, represented a [[Supersessionism|breach with Judaism, the Temple, and the Law]]. Thus there was some antagonism between the Jewish apostles [[Saint Peter|Peter]], [[Saint James the Just|James]] and [[John the Apostle|John]], and Paul the "Apostle to the Gentiles", and this struggle continued down to the middle of the 2nd century. In short, the conflict between Petrinism and Paulinism is, as [[Karl Schwarz]] puts it, the key to the literature of the 1st and 2nd century.

==Theology==
Baur was a theologian and historian as well as a Biblical critic. As early as 1834 he published a strictly theological work, ''Gegensatz des Katholicismus und Protestantismus nach den Prinzipien und Hauptdogmen der beiden Lehrbegriffe'', a strong defence of [[Protestantism]] on the lines of Schleiermacher's ''Glaubenslehre'', and a vigorous reply to [[Johann Adam Möhler|J. Möhler]]'s ''Symbolik'' (1833). This was followed by his larger histories of [[dogma]], ''Die christliche Lehre von der Versöhnung in ihrer geschichtlichen Entwicklung bis auf die neueste Zeit'' (1838), ''Die christliche Lehre von der Dreieinigkeit und Menschwerdung Gottes in ihrer geschichtlichen Entwicklung'' (3 vols., 1841–1843), and the ''Lehrbuch der christlichen Dogmengeschichte'' (1847). The value of these works is impaired somewhat by Baur's habit of making the history of dogma conform to the formulae of Hegel's philosophy, a procedure "which only served to obscure the truth and profundity of his conception of history as a true development of the human mind" (Pfleiderer). Baur, however, soon came to attach more importance to personality, and to distinguish more carefully between religion and philosophy.
The change is noticeable in his ''Epochen der kirchlichen Geschichtschreibung'' (1852), ''Das Christenthum und die christiche Kirche der drei ersten Jahrhunderte'' (1853), and ''Die christliche Kirche von Anfang des vierten bis zum Ende das sechsten Jahrhunderts'' (1859), works preparatory to his ''Kirchengeschichte'', in which the change of view is specially pronounced.

==Death and posthumous publication==
Baur died, aged 68, in [[Tübingen]].  The ''Kirchengeschichte'' was published in five volumes during the years 1853-1863, partly by Baur himself, partly by his son, Ferdinand Baur, and his son-in-law, [[Eduard Zeller]], from notes and lectures which the author left behind him. Pfleiderer describes this work, especially the first volume, as a classic for all time. "Taken as a whole, it is the first thorough and satisfactory attempt to explain the rise of Christianity and the Church on strictly historical lines, i.e. as a natural development of the religious spirit of our race under the combined operation of various human causes" (''Development of Theology'', p.&amp;nbsp;288). Baur's lectures on the history of dogma, ''Ausführlichere Vorlesungen uber die christliche Dogmengeschichte'', were published later by his son (1865–1868).

==Tübingen School==
The Tübingen School was at the height of its influence in the 1840s, but lost ground to historical fact.&lt;ref name="Cross"/&gt; Since [[Adolf von Harnack]] proposed very early dates for the synoptics and Acts (c. 1910), the Tübingen School has been generally abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;"Harnack, Adolf" and "Tübingen School."

{{Zoroastrianism}}

'''Frashokereti''' (''{{lang|ae-Latn|frašō.kərəti}}'') is the [[Avestan language|Avestan-language]] term (corresponding to [[Zoroastrian Middle Persian|Middle Persian]] ''fraš(a)gird'' &lt;plškrt&gt;) for the [[Zoroastrian]] doctrine of a final renovation of the universe, when evil will be destroyed, and everything else will be then in perfect unity with God ([[Ahura Mazda]]). 

The doctrinal premises are (1) good will eventually prevail over evil; (2) creation was initially perfectly good, but was subsequently corrupted by evil; (3) the world will ultimately be restored to the perfection it had at the time of creation; (4) the "salvation for the individual depended on the sum of [that person's] thoughts, words and deeds, and there could be no intervention, whether compassionate or capricious, by any divine being to alter this." Thus, each human bears the responsibility for the fate of his own soul, and simultaneously shares in the responsibility for the fate of the world.&lt;ref name="Boyce"&gt;{{citation|last=Boyce|first=Mary|authorlink=Mary Boyce|title=Zoroastrians: Their Religious Beliefs and Practices|year=1979|location=London|publisher=Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul|isbn=978-0-415-23902-8|pages=27–29|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a6gbxVfjtUEC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology and Meaning ==
The name suggests  "making wonderful, excellent". &lt;ref group="n"&gt;The second part ''kərəti'' in Avestan means "making" (''kardan'' in New Persian), but the meaning of the adjective ''fraša-'' is not certain; it probably indicates, and is usually translated as, "wonderful, excellent".&lt;/ref&gt; D. N. MacKenzie in ''A Concise Dictionary of Pahlavi'' gives the meaning as "the Restoration (at the end of time)". &lt;ref name="MacKenzie"&gt;{{citation|last=MacKenzie|first=D.N. (David Neil)|title=A Concise Dictionary of Pahlavi|year=1971|location=London|publisher=Oxford University Press|pages=33}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Considering this meaning, the first part could indicate "early, first, initial", related to ''fra'' prefix, cognate with ''pro'' in Greek and Latin. Then the overall meaning being "making into initial state", hence "restoration".  

==Eschatology==
The [[eschatology|eschatological]] ideas are only alluded to in the surviving texts of the [[Avesta]], and are known of in detail only from the texts of Zoroastrian tradition, in particular in the ca. 9th century ''[[Bundahishn]]''. The accompanying story, as it appears in the ''Bundahishn'' (''GBd'' 30.1ff), runs as follows:&lt;ref name="Boyce" /&gt; At the end of the "third time" (the first being the age of creation, the second of mixture, and the third of separation), there will be a great battle between the forces of good (the [[yazata|''yazata''s]]) and those of evil (the [[daeva|''daeva''s]]) in which the good will triumph. On earth, the [[Saoshyant]] will bring about a [[resurrection of the dead]] in the bodies they had before they died. This is followed by a [[last judgment]] through ordeal. The ''yazata''s [[Airyaman]] and [[Atar]] will melt the metal in the hills and mountains, and the molten metal will then flow across the earth like a river. All mankind—both the living and the resurrected dead—will be required to wade through that river, but for the righteous (''[[ashavan]]'') it will seem to be a river of warm milk, while the wicked will be burned. The river will then flow down to hell, where it will annihilate [[Angra Mainyu]] and the last vestiges of wickedness in the universe.

The narrative continues with a projection of [[Ahura Mazda]] and the six [[Amesha Spenta]]s solemnizing a final act of worship (''yasna''), and the [[Ab-Zohr|preparation of ''parahaoma'']] from "white [[haoma]]". The righteous will partake of the ''parahaoma'', which will confer immortality upon them. Thereafter, humankind will become like the Amesha Spentas, living without food, without hunger or thirst, and without weapons (or possibility of bodily injury). The material substance of the bodies will be so light as to cast no shadow. All humanity will speak a single language and belong to a single nation without borders. All will share a single purpose and goal, joining with the divine for a perpetual exaltation of God's glory.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Taylor|first=Richard P.|title=Death and Afterlife: A Cultural Encyclopedia|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year=2000|page=312}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although ''frashokereti'' is a restoration of the time of creation, there is no return to the uniqueness of the primordial plant, animal and human; while in the beginning there was one plant, one animal and one human, the variety that had since issued would remain forever.&lt;ref name="Boyce" /&gt; Similarly, the host of divinities brought into existence by Mazda continue to have distinct existences, "and there is no prophecy of their re-absorption into the Godhead."&lt;ref name="Boyce" /&gt;

The [[Basic Law]], in accordance with tradition, declares that [[Islam in Oman|Islam]] is the [[state religion]] and that [[Shari'a]] is the source of legislation. It also prohibits discrimination based on religion and provides for the freedom to practice religious rites as long as doing so does not disrupt public order. The Government generally respected this right, but within defined parameters that placed limitations on the right in practice. While the Government continued to protect the free practice of religion in general, it formalized previously unwritten prohibitions on religious gatherings in locations other than government-approved houses of worship, and on non-Islamic institutions issuing publications within their communities, without prior approval from the [[Ministry of Endowments and Religious Affairs (Oman)|Ministry of Endowments and Religious Affairs]] (MERA). There were no reports of societal abuses or discrimination based on religious belief or practice.

==Religious demography==
{{main|Religion in Oman}}

The country has an area of {{convert|310000|km2|sqmi}} and a population of 2.5 million, of whom 1.9 million are [[citizens]]. The government does not keep official statistics on religious affiliation, but three quarters of [[Omanis]] adhere to the [[Ibadi]] sect of Islam, while the remaining 25% are either [[Sunni]] or [[Shia]] Muslims. There are small communities of 5% ethnically [[India]]n [[Hindu]]s and [[Christians]] that have been naturalized. Ibadism historically has been Oman's dominant religious sect, and the [[Sultan of Oman|Sultan]] is a member of the Ibadi community. The Government, however, does not give official preference to any particular religious group.

Non-Ibadi and non-Sunni religious communities individually constitute less than 5 percent of the population and include, Hindus, [[Buddhist]]s, [[Sikh]]s, and Christians. Christian communities are centered in the major urban areas of [[Muscat, Oman|Muscat]], [[Sohar]], and [[Salalah]] and are represented by [[Roman Catholic]], [[Eastern Orthodox]], and various [[Protestant]] congregations. These groups tend to organize along linguistic and ethnic lines. More than 50 different Christian groups, fellowships, and assemblies are active in the Muscat metropolitan area. Shi'a Muslims are a small but well-integrated minority, concentrated in the capital area and along the northern coast. The majority of non-Muslims, however, are noncitizen immigrant workers from [[South Asia]]. There are also communities of ethnic [[Indian people|Indian]] [[Hindus]]. Muscat has two Hindu temples. One of them is over a hundred years old. There is also a significant [[Sikh]] community in Oman. Though there are no permanent [[gurudwaras]], many smaller gurudwaras in makeshift camps exist and are recognised by the government. The Government of India had signed an accord in 2008 with the Omani government to build a permanent [[gurudwara]] but little progress has been made on the matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sify.com/news/oman-to-allow-temple-gurdwara-news-national-klytaydgdgd.html|title=Oman to allow temple, gurdwara|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Status of religious freedom==

===Legal and policy framework===
The Basic Law declares that Islam is the state religion and that Shari'a (Islamic law) is the source of legislation. It also prohibits discrimination against individuals on the basis of religion or religious identity and provides for the freedom to practice religious rites so long as doing so does not disrupt public order. In May 2006 the MERA issued a circular to non-Muslim religious leaders and diplomatic missions, reaffirming the individual's right to practice his or her own religious activities according to his or her values, customs, and traditions; however, the circular informed them that gatherings of a religious nature are not allowed in private homes or any other locations except government-approved houses of worship. The circular, which formalized existing, but unwritten, government policy, also prohibits non-Islamic institutions from issuing publications within their communities without prior ministerial approval.

All religious organizations must be registered and licensed by the MERA. The Ministry recognizes the [[Protestant Church of Oman]], the [[Catholic Diocese of Oman]], the [[al Amana Center]] (interdenominational Christian), the [[Hindu Mahajan Association]], and the [[Anwar al-Ghubaira Trading Company in Muscat]] (Sikh) as the official sponsors for non-Islamic religious communities. Groups seeking licensure must request meeting and worship space from one of these sponsor organizations, which are responsible for recording the group's doctrinal adherence, the names of its leaders, and the number of active members and submitting this information to the Ministry. Members of non-Islamic communities were free to maintain links with fellow adherents abroad and undertake foreign travel for religious purposes. The Government permitted clergy from abroad to enter the country, under the sponsorship of licensed religious organizations, for the purposes of teaching or leading worship.

Officials at the MERA claim that there is no limit on the number of groups that can be licensed. New religious groups unaffiliated with one of the main communities must gain ministerial approval before receiving a license. While the Government has not published the rules, regulations, or criteria for approval, the Ministry generally considers the group's size, theology or belief system, and availability of other worship opportunities before granting approval. The Ministry employs similar criteria before granting approval for new Muslim groups to form. According to government regulations, mosques must be built at least 1 kilometer apart and only on government-owned land.

Religious leaders of all faiths must be licensed with the MERA. The Ministry has a formal licensing process for Muslim imams, however unlicensed lay members are not prohibited from leading prayers in mosques. Lay members of non-Islamic communities may lead worship if they are specified as leaders in their group's licensing application. Foreigners on tourist visas are prohibited from preaching, teaching, or leading worship.

[[Apostasy]] is not a criminal offense under Omani law. Citizens who convert from Islam to another faith, however, generally face problems under Oman's [[Personal Status and Family Legal Code]], which specifically prohibits a father who leaves the Islamic faith from retaining paternal rights over his children. The law does not prohibit proselytizing, but the MERA will stop individuals or groups from engaging in it if the Ministry receives complaints. The Government uses immigration regulations and laws against harassment to enforce the Ministry's policy. Article 209 of the Penal Code assigns a prison sentence and fine to anyone who publicly blasphemes God or His prophets, commits an affront to religions and faiths by spoken or written word, or breaches the peace of a lawful religious gathering; this could be used to limit religious expression. However, there were no reports of any prosecutions under this statute during the reporting period. The Ministry reviews all imported religious material for approval.

Laws governing family and personal status are adjudicated by Oman's civil courts, according to the Personal Status and Family Legal Code, which is based on the principles of Shari'a. Some aspects of the code discriminate against women, particularly by favoring male heirs in adjudicating inheritance claims. While there was continuing reluctance to take an inheritance dispute to court, for fear of alienating the family, women increasingly were aware of, and took steps to protect and exercise, their rights as citizens. Article 282 of the code exempts non-Muslims from the code's provisions, allowing them to follow their own religious rules pertaining to family or personal status.

Instruction in Islam is mandatory in the basic curriculum in all [[State school|public school]] grades [[Kindergarten|K]]-[[Grade 12|12]]. Non-Muslim students are allowed to opt out of the public school system and attend [[private schools]] that do not offer instruction in Islam. Non-Muslim members of the military are also exempt from otherwise mandatory Islamic studies. Military bases maintain at least one [[mosque]] and one [[imam]] for the convenience of military personnel. Training facilities dedicate approximately three sessions per week for the study of Islamic subjects. While non-Muslim members of the military were not prohibited from practicing their own religion, the military did not provide them with alternative places of worship on base.

The Government sponsored fora for examining differing interpretations of Islam, and government-sponsored interfaith dialogues took place on a regular basis. Private groups that promote [[interfaith]] dialogue were permitted to exist, as long as discussions did not constitute an attempt to cause Muslims to recant their Islamic beliefs. During the reporting period, the MERA hosted several Christian and Muslim scholars and lecturers of various schools of thought to discuss interfaith relations and tolerance in Islamic traditions.

The [[Islamic holy days]] of [[Eid al-Adha]], Islamic ([[Hijri year|Hijra]]) New Year, the [[Birth of the Prophet Muhammad]], [[Isra and Mi'raj|Ascension Day]], and [[Eid al-Fitr]] are national holidays.

===Restrictions on religious freedom===
While the Government generally respected the [[freedom of religion]], some government procedures and policies placed limitations on religious practice.

The prohibition on group worship in private homes or other locations limited the ability of some adherents who were physically distant from those locations or who lacked reliable transportation to practice their faith collectively. There were reports that government officials monitored and stopped several small groups from meeting in unsanctioned locations during the reporting period. On the whole, [[church (building)|churches]] and temples voluntarily abided by the May 2006 circular, taking steps to enforce the prohibitions among groups under their sponsorship and provide space on their compounds for worship; however, the lack of sufficient space in the existing locations sanctioned by the Government for collective worship, as well as long waiting lists for use of these facilities, effectively limited the number of groups that could operate.

The MERA approved a limited number of "church visas" to professional clergy of non-Islamic congregations. Some leaders in these congregations claimed, however, that the number of approved clergy was insufficient to handle the demand for worship and therefore limited the natural growth of these congregations.

The MERA monitored sermons at mosques to ensure that imams did not discuss political topics. The Government expected all imams to preach sermons within the parameters of standardized texts distributed monthly by the Ministry. While the MERA did not control the content of sermons in non-Islamic communities, groups were prohibited from issuing any publications without obtaining the Ministry's prior approval.

There were no reports of religious prisoners or detainees in the country.

===Forced religious conversion===
There were no reports of [[forced religious conversion]], including of minor U.S. citizens who had been abducted or illegally removed from the United States, or of the refusal to allow such citizens to be returned to the United States.

===Improvements and positive developments in respect for religious freedom===
During the reporting period, the MERA met with visiting leaders of some non-Islamic faiths regarding the state of their communities in Oman and discussed the possibility of allowing groups to establish new places of worship in other metropolitan areas. The Ministry provided an additional 10,000 square meters of space to one of the Christian compounds in Muscat to facilitate its expansion, which could help ease space constraints that limit religious practice.

==Societal abuses and discrimination==
There were no reports of societal abuses or discrimination based on religious belief or practice.

[[Image:Mucius Scaevola Deseine Louvre RF2987.jpg|thumb|200px|'''Mucius Scævola''' by [[Louis-Pierre Deseine]], 1791, [[Louvre]] Museum]]
'''Gaius Mucius Scaevola''' was an [[Ancient Rome|Ancient Roman]] youth, possibly mythical, famous for his bravery.

In 508 BC, during the [[Roman-Etruscan_Wars#War_with_Clusium_in_508_BC|war between Rome and Clusium]], the Clusian king [[Lars Porsena]] laid siege to Rome. Mucius, with the approval of the [[Roman Senate]], snuck into the Etruscan camp with the intent of murdering Porsena. Since it was the soldiers' pay day, there were two similarly dressed people, one of whom was the king, on a raised platform speaking to the troops. This caused Mucius to misidentify his target, and he killed Porsena's scribe by mistake. After being captured, he famously declared to Porsena: "I am Gaius Mucius, a citizen of Rome. I came here as an enemy to kill my enemy, and I am as ready to die as I am to kill. We Romans act bravely and, when adversity strikes, we suffer bravely." He also declared that he was the first of three hundred Roman youths to volunteer for the task of assassinating Porsena at the risk of losing their own lives.&lt;ref&gt;[[Livy]],''[[Ab Urbe Condita (book)|Ab Urbe Condita]]'', 2.12&lt;/ref&gt;

"Watch", he is said to have declared, "so that you know how cheap the body is to men who have their eye on great glory". Mucius thrust his right hand into a fire which was lit for sacrifice and held it there without giving any indication of pain, thereby earning for himself and his descendants the [[cognomen]] ''Scaevola'', meaning "left-handed". Porsena was shocked at the youth's bravery, and dismissed him from the Etruscan camp, free to return to Rome, saying "Go back, since you do more harm to yourself than me". At the same time, the king also sent ambassadors to Rome to offer peace.&lt;ref&gt;Livy, ''Ab Urbe Condita'', 2.12-3&lt;/ref&gt;

Mucius was granted farming land on the right-hand bank of the Tiber, which later became known as the ''Mucia Prata'' (Mucian Meadows).&lt;ref&gt;[[Livy]], ''Ab Urbe Condita'', 2.12-13&lt;/ref&gt;

It is not clear whether the story of Mucius is historical or mythical.  Parallels noted by Georges Dumezil with the Germanic [[Týr]] suggest the possibility the Scaevola story is a pseudo-historical version of an older Indo-European myth involving an act of divine perjury to overcome an existential threat to the gods or the world (or in the Scaevola story, human perjury to preserve the Roman state).{{cn|date=June 2018}}

The story of Mucius inspired a punishment in Rome's [[Colosseum]] for condemned prisoners where they would be forced to reenact this tale.&lt;ref&gt;Angela, A. (2009) ''A Day in the Life of Ancient Rome'' Europa Editions. p. 260&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Dante Alighieri]] refers to Mucius and the sacrifice of his hand within the ''[[Divine Comedy]]''. In ''[[Paradiso (Dante)|Paradiso]]'' Canto 4: 82–87, along with [[St. Lawrence]], Mucius is depicted as a person possessing the rarest and firmest of wills. 
*[[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] mentions in Book One of his ''[[Confessions (Rousseau)|Confessions]]'' that as a child, he attempted to replicate Mucius' action by placing his hand over a [[chafing dish]].
* At the age of twelve, [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], attempting to prove the story could be true to his classmates at [[Schulpforte]], burnt his outstretched palm over a book of burning matches without expression of pain and was only saved from serious harm by the school's prefect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Nietzsche and the Modern Crisis of the Humanities|author=Peter Levine|page=3|publisher=State University of New York Press|year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Gordon Scott]] portrayed Mucius in the [[sword-and-sandal]] film ''[[Hero of Rome]]'' (1964), which was loosely based on this story.
*Since 1991 Spanish cultural association Fuerzas de Choque Extraordinarii from the [[Carthaginians and Romans]] festivities of [[Cartagena, Spain|Cartagena]] has Gaius Mucius Scaevola as their commander.

On the 18th of Safar, the second month of the [[Islamic calendar]], pilgrims gather in the holy Mouride city of [[Touba, Senegal|Touba]] to celebrate the life and teachings of [[Amadou Bamba|Cheikh Amadou Bamba]], the founder of the brotherhood.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bava|first=Sophie|last2=Gueye|first2=Cheikh|date=2001-09-01|title=Le grand magal de Touba: exil prophétique, migration et pèlerinage au sein du mouridisme|url=http://scp.sagepub.com/content/48/3/421|journal=Social Compass|language=en|volume=48|issue=3|pages=421–438|doi=10.1177/003776801048003008|issn=0037-7686}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Grand Magal has been recognized as "one of the most popular pilgrimages in the world," with over 3 million participating in 2011.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The pilgrimage dates back to 1928 (one year after Bamba's death) and commemorates his 1895 exile to [[Gabon]] by the [[French colonial empire|French colonial government]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Etymology and history ==
"Magal" is a [[Wolof language|Wolof]] word derived from the verb "mag," which means "to be important" or "to be old"; the noun form is translated as "celebration" or "anniversary."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Coulon|first=Christian|date=1999-01-01|title=The Grand Magal in Touba: A Religious Festival of the Mouride Brotherhood of Senegal|jstor=723626|journal=African Affairs|volume=98|issue=391|pages=195–210}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are other Mouride magals annually, such as the Magal of [[Saint-Louis, Senegal|Saint Louis]], which commemorates a prayer performed by the saint in 1895 in defiance of colonial authorities.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=29782748|title=Remembering the Nation The Murid Maggal of Saint-Louis Senegal (Mémoire de la nation. Les Maggal mourides de Saint-Louis, Sénégal) on JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Grand Magal is the most important and widely attended of the Mouride magals - indeed, it is the largest celebration in Senegal, religious or secular.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The Grand Magal originates in a request of Cheikh Amadou Bamba's in which he asked that his followers celebrate the anniversary of his exile to Gabon.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, after the Cheikh's death in 1927, his son and successor Serigne Moustapha Mbacke organized the first Mouride gathering on the anniversary of his death rather than his exile (the first of these early Magals occurred in 1928, with an estimated participation of 70,000).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This date remained until 1946, when Serigne Moustapha Mbacke's successor, Falilou Mbacke, changed the date of the Magal to the anniversary of Bamba's exile, in accordance with the Cheikh's original wishes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The period of exile in Gabon holds great importance to Mourides: it is seen as a time of persecution and testing of Bamba's spiritual strength and resolve.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://toubaexposition.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/magal-fr.pdf|title=Grand Magal de Touba: Dimension religieuse et sociale|last=Abdour-Rahmane|first=Sam Bousso|date=2012|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Grand Magal has grown over the years, from hundreds of thousands of pilgrims attending in the later decades of the twentieth century to nearly 2 million in 2000 and over 3 million in 2011.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.icrc.org/eng/resources/documents/feature/2012/senegal-feature-2012-02-01.htm|title=Senegal: helping lost children at the Magal in Touba - ICRC|date=2012-02-20|website=www.icrc.org|language=en-us|access-date=2016-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The event is televised, with coverage in part serving the Mouride Brotherhood's proselytizing mission; video cassettes of the Magal are sold domestically and internationally as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=4007009|title=New Information &amp; Communication Technology Use by Muslim Mourides in Senegal on JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Dates of the Grand Magal ==
The date of the Grand Magal is determined by the [[Islamic calendar]] (known as the Hijri calendar), which is based on the [[lunar year]]. Each year, the events of the pilgrimage begin on the 18th of Safar and last for two days. Because the Islamic calendar is [[lunar calendar|lunar]] and the Islamic year is about eleven days shorter than the [[Gregorian calendar|Gregorian]] year, the date for the Grand Magal changes from year to year. Thus, each year in the Gregorian calendar, the pilgrimage starts eleven days (sometimes ten days) earlier than the preceding year. This makes it possible for the pilgrimage season to fall twice in one Gregorian year, and it does so every 33 years, most recently in 2013. The Grand Magal of 2017 will begin on November 7, 2017 (with the small possibility of a one-day error).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.islamicfinder.org/islamic-date-converter/|title=Islamic Date Converter, Hijri calculator {{!}} IslamicFinder|website=www.islamicfinder.org|access-date=2016-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The table below shows the Gregorian dates of the Grand Magal of recent years:

== Rites and rituals ==
The Grand Magal is at once a ceremony and a festival, containing both religious rituals and entertainment. "No other event in Senegal, religious or secular, attracts as much attention", writes Villalón;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Islamic Society and State Power in Senegal: Disciples and Citizens in Fatick|last=Villalón|first=Leonardo A.|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1995|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is "anticipated for weeks and generates a general effervescence."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The rites of the pilgrimage bear similarities to those of the Islamic [[Hajj]] pilgrimage to Mecca: the two central events of the Magal are visits to the [[Great Mosque of Touba]], which involves a partial circumambulation of the mosque,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and to the mausoleum of Cheikh Amadou Bamba, which is believed to be infused with the ''[[barakah]]'', or spiritual power, of the Cheikh. Pilgrims pray with outstretched hands and touch the walls and doors of the mausoleum, and some drop coins inside the area around the tomb, which is fenced off.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=422024|title=Sufi Rituals as Rallies: Religious Ceremonies in the Politics of Senegalese State-Society Relations on JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt; They may wait for over six hours for a few minutes of prayer at these locations.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Pilgrims also visit the mausoleums of other important Mouride leaders, many of whose tombs are located near the mosque. Other common sites to visit include the "Well of Mercy," said to have been created by God to flow for Cheikh Amadou Bamba, and the central library of Touba, which contains the many writings of the Cheikh and other influential Mourides.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Lastly, pilgrims visit their personal Mouride spiritual guides, or [[marabout]]s. Each prominent Mouride marabout has a residence in the city from which he accepts visits. During the night, pilgrims gather to sing Arabic poetry (or [[Qasā'id|qaṣāʾid]]) written by the Cheikh.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dang|first=Christine Thu Nhi|date=2013-06-03|title=Pilgrimage Through Poetry: Sung Journeys Within the Murid Spiritual Diaspora|url=http://booksandjournals.brillonline.com/content/journals/10.5192/21540993040169|journal=Islamic Africa|volume=4|issue=1|pages=69–101|doi=10.5192/21540993040169|issn=2154-0993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also a political dimension to the Grand Magal, in which the most prominent Mouride leaders - including the head of the Brotherhood, or Caliph General (currently Serigne Sidy Mokhtar Mbacké&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mourides.info/serigne-sidy-mokhtar-mbacke/|title=Qui est qui : Serigne Sidy Mokhtar MBACKÉ – Mourides.info|website=www.mourides.info|access-date=2016-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;) – grant audiences to official government delegations and others of political importance. The tradition has roots in the colonial period, when it was created to defuse tension and demonstrate mutual recognition between the powerful Mourides and the French colonial government.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Informally, pilgrims also visit Touba's renowned marketplace, one of the biggest in the country. Because of the minimal government presence in the city (due to its religious character), business is conducted with little state regulation or oversight; a wide range of products can thus be found with prices lower than those of any other market in Senegal.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Logistics and facilities ==
The large number of pilgrims in Touba during the Grand Magal demands an intense degree of organization and logistical management. Traffic jams and road accidents are common as heavy crowds descend on Touba each year; during the November 2016 Magal, 16 people were killed and 572 injured while travelling to the pilgrimage, according to the lieutenant-colonel of the National Fire Brigade.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/least-16-killed-travelling-sufi-muslim-pilgrimage-senegal-town-tuba-1592656|title=At least 16 killed travelling to Sufi Muslim pilgrimage in Senegal town of Tuba|last=Buchanan|first=Elsa|date=2016-11-21|newspaper=International Business Times UK|access-date=2017-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Touba, workers must act with a high degree of discipline, solidarity, and single-mindedness. The Mouride [[Mouride#Baye Fall|Baye Fall]] sect are the principle drivers of this effort and provide much of the logistical manpower.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Additionally, different local associations of Mourides (called da'iras) are responsible for maintaining different pilgrimage sites&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; and residents of Touba house and feed the pilgrims.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-senegal-pilgrimage-idUKL0867640420070308|title=Million Muslim pilgrims flock to Senegal's "Mecca"|last=Editorial|first=Reuters|newspaper=Reuters UK|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Senegalese government also provides some technical support, although this is generally kept to a minimum due to the religious nature of the event and site. In 2014, 1300 policemen and 160 healthcare workers were deployed to Touba during the Magal, and the army gave out bread rolls and coffee.&lt;ref name="Trichet" /&gt;

Preparations for the pilgrimage begin officially on 1 Safar each year, seventeen days prior to the pilgrimage, and are led by the Committee of Organization of the Grand Magal of Touba.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.magal-touba.org/|title=Touba / Mbacké|website=www.magal-touba.org|access-date=2016-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== International Presence ==
By the late 1970s, significant numbers of Mourides were living abroad;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ross|first=E.|date=2011-02-09|title=Globalising Touba: Expatriate Disciples in the World City Network|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0042098010391300|journal=Urban Studies|language=en|volume=48|issue=14|pages=2929–2952|doi=10.1177/0042098010391300}}&lt;/ref&gt; this presence has only grown with the intensifying globalization of the past decades. Community associations of disciples, known as dahiras (a Wolof term derived from the Arabic word for "circle"), have arisen in many international cities with robust Mouride communities: in 2011, researchers found 47 cities across western Europe and 16 cities in North America with active Mouride dahiras.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; According to Ross, "Murid ''dahiras'' abroad are intended as both extensions of, and conduits to, the holy city itself" and they organize celebrations of the Grand Magal annually.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

In these gatherings, the singing of sacred Mouride poetry and watching of televised footage from Touba is especially important, as these practices connect expatriate Mourides to their spiritual brethren in Touba.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; With the organizational support of the dahiras, the Grand Magal and can now be accurately characterized as a truly global phenomenon.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

[[File:Piacenza Bronzeleber.jpg|thumb|Diagram of the sheep's liver found near [[Piacenza]] with [[Etruscan language|Etruscan]] inscriptions on the bronze sheep's [[Liver of Piacenza]]]]

In the [[Ancient Roman religion|religion of Ancient Rome]], a '''haruspex''' (plural '''haruspices'''; also called '''aruspex''') was a person trained to practice a form of [[divination]] called '''haruspicy''' (''haruspicina''), the inspection of the entrails (''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#exta|exta]]''&amp;mdash;hence also '''extispicy''' (''extispicium'')) of [[Animal sacrifice|sacrificed animal]]s, especially the [[liver]]s of sacrificed [[domestic sheep|sheep]] and [[poultry]]. 
The reading of omens specifically from the liver is also known by the Greek term  '''hepatoscopy''' (also '''hepatomancy''').

The Roman concept is directly derived from [[Etruscan religion]], as one of the three branches of the ''[[disciplina Etrusca]]''. Such methods continued to be used well into the [[Middle Ages]], especially among [[Christian apostates]] and pagans, with [[Thomas Becket]] apparently consulting both an aruspex and a [[Palmistry|chiromancer]] prior to a royal expedition against [[Brittany]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/historyofmagicex02thor|title=A history of magic and experimental science|last=Thorndike|first=Lynn|date=1923|publisher=New York, Macmillan|volume=2|page=167}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Latin terms ''[[:wikt:haruspex|haruspex]]'', ''haruspicina'' are from an archaic word ''haru'' "entrails, intestines" (cognate with ''hernia''  "protruding viscera", and ''hira''  "empty gut"; PIE ''[[:wikt:Appendix:Proto-Indo-European/ǵʰer-|*ǵʰer-]]'') and from the root  ''[[:wikt:specio#Latin|spec-]]'' "to watch, observe". The Greek ἡπατοσκοπία ''hēpatoskōpia'' is from ''[[:wikt:ἧπαρ|hēpar]]'' "liver" and ''[[:wikt:σκοπέω|skop-]] "to examine".

==Ancient Near East==

The Babylonians were famous for [[hepatoscopy]]. This practice is mentioned in the [[Book of Ezekiel]] 21:21:

"For the king of Babylon standeth at the parting of the way, at the head of the two ways, to use divination; he [[belomancy|shaketh the arrows]] to and fro, he inquireth of the teraphim, he looketh in the liver".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mechon-mamre.org/e/et/et1221.htm|title = Ezekiel 21|publisher = Mechon-Mamre|website = Hebrew Bible in English}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also: Darshan, Guy, [https://www.academia.edu/19691541/The_Meaning_of_%D7%91%D7%A8%D7%90_Ezek_21_24_and_the_Prophecy_Concerning_Nebuchadnezzar_at_the_Crossroads_Ezek_21_23_29_18_24_ZAW_128_2016_83_95 “The Meaning of bārēʾ (Ez 21,24) and the Prophecy Concerning Nebuchadnezzar at the Crossroads (Ez 21,23-29),”] ZAW 128 (2016), 83-95.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Nineveh]] library texts name more than a dozen liver-related terms. The liver was considered the source of the blood and hence the basis of life itself. From this belief, the Babylonians thought they could discover the will of the gods by examining the livers of carefully selected sheep. A priest known as a ''[[bārû]]'' was specially trained to interpret the "signs" of the liver, and Babylonian scholars assembled a monumental compendium of omens called the [[Bārûtu]]. The liver was divided into sections, with each section representing a particular deity.

One Babylonian clay model of a sheep's liver, dated between 1900 and 1600 BC, is conserved in the [[British Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details/collection_image_gallery.aspx?partid=1&amp;assetid=32437&amp;objectid=361996 The Liver tablet 92668].&lt;/ref&gt; The model was used for divination, which was important to Mesopotamian medicine. This practice was conducted by priests and seers who looked for signs in the stars, or in the organs of sacrificed animals, to tell them things about a patient’s illness. Wooden pegs were placed in the holes of the clay tablet to record features found in a sacrificed animal's liver. The seer then used these features to predict the course of a patient's illness.

Haruspicy was part of a larger study of organs for the sake of divination, called ''extispicy'', paying particular attention to the positioning of the organs and their shape. There are many records of different peoples using the liver and spleen of various domestic and wild animals to forecast weather. There are hundreds of ancient architectural objects, labyrinths composed of cobblestones in the northern countries that are considered to be a model of the intestines of the sacrificial animal, i.e. the colon of ruminants.

The Assyro-Babylonian tradition was also adopted in [[Hittite religion]]. At least thirty-six liver-models have been excavated at [[Hattusa]]. Of these, the majority are inscribed in Akkadian,  but a few examples also have inscriptions in the native [[Hittite language]], indicating the adoption of haruspicy as part of the native, vernacular cult.&lt;ref&gt;four specimens are known to Güterbock (1987): [[Catalogue des Textes Hittites|CTH]] 547 II, KBo 9 67, KBo 25, KUB 4 72 (VAT 8320 in [[Vorderasiatisches Museum Berlin]]), for which see also [[George Sarton]], ''Ancient Science Through the Golden Age of Greece'' (1952, 1970), [https://books.google.ch/books?id=VcoGIKlHuZcC&amp;pg=PA93 p. 93], citing Alfred Boissier, ''Mantique babylonienne et mantique hittite'' (1935).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etruscan and Roman haruspicy==
The Etruscans were also well known for the practice of divining by the entrails of sheep. A [[bronze sculpture]] of a liver known as the "[[Liver of Piacenza]]", dating to around 100 BC, was discovered in 1877 near the town of [[Piacenza]] in northern [[Italy]]. It is marked with the name of regions assigned to various [[List of Etruscan mythological figures|deities of Etruscan religion]].

The striking parallel not just of the prevalence of the practice of haruspicy, but the specific artifact type of liver models recording the significance of the various parts of the liver has given rise to the hypothesis of a strong cultural connection between Etruria and the Ancient Near East. From as early as 1900, [[Ludwig Stieda]]{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} sought to compare the Etruscan with the Babylonian artifacts. The parallel is taken as one of the main pieces of evidence by those arguing for [[Etruscan origins]] in Anatolia, alongside [[Herodotus]]' (1.94) claim that the  "[[Tyrrhenians]]" descended from the [[Lydia]]ns, and the linguistic relationship between Etruscan and [[Lemnian language|Lemnian]].&lt;ref&gt;"it is possible that the mysterious Etruscan brought Babylonian hepatoscopy with them from Western Asia"
 [[George Sarton]], ''Ancient Science Through the Golden Age of Greece'' (1952, 1970), [https://books.google.ch/books?id=VcoGIKlHuZcC&amp;pg=PA93 p. 93]&lt;/ref&gt;

The art of haruspicy was taught in the ''Libri Tagetici'', a collection of texts attributed to [[Tages]], a childlike being who figures in [[Etruscan mythology]], and who was discovered in an open field by [[Tarchon]]; the ''Libri Tagetici'' were translated into Latin and employed in reading omens.

The continuity of the Etruscan tradition among the Romans is indicated by several ancient literary sources, perhaps most famously in the incident related by [[Suetonius]]&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''Divus Julius'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Julius*.html 81.]&lt;/ref&gt; in which a haruspex named [[Spurinna]] warned [[Julius Caesar]] to beware the [[Ides of March]].

The emperor [[Claudius]] was a student of the [[Etruscan language]] and [[Antiquarian#Antiquarianism in ancient Rome|antiquities]], and opened a college to preserve and improve their art, which lasted until the reign of [[Theodosius I]], the Christian emperor who dismantled the last active vestiges of the traditional state cult. Further evidence has been found of haruspices in [[Bath, Somerset|Bath, England]] where the base of a statue was dedicated by a haruspex named Memor.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

'''Isetsuhiko-no-mikoto''' (伊勢都彦命 or 伊勢都比古命) is an obscure Japanese [[Kami|god]] of [[List of wind deities|the wind]] who appears in both the ''[[Fudoki]]'' of [[Ise Province]] (surviving only in the form of excerpts found in other writings) and the ''Fudoki'' of [[Harima Province]].

:At the time when Amenohiwake-no-mikoto accompanied the Sovereign (''[[Emperor of Japan|Sumera-mikoto]]'') [[Emperor Jimmu|Kamu-Yamato-Iwarehiko]] when he set out from [[Hyūga Province|the western palace]] in order to conquer this eastern land, he arrived with the Sovereign in [[Kumano, Mie|the village of Kumano]] in [[Kii Province|the land of Kii]]. Then, under the guidance of a golden crow, they entered [[Kinai|the central land]], arriving at Shimotsu-agata in [[Uda, Nara|Uda]].&lt;br&gt;
:The Sovereign commanded Ōtomo-no-Hiomi-no-mikoto, 'Quickly subjugate the rebellious Nagasune of [[Mount Ikoma|Ikoma]].' He then ordered Amenohiwake-no-mikoto, 'There is a land in the east&lt;ref&gt;Translation follows the conjecture of Kurita, Hiroshi (1903), ''[http://dl.ndl.go.jp/info:ndljp/pid/993515/66 Kofudoki itsubun kōshō (古風土記逸文考証)]''. Dai-Nippon-tosho. p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; (lit. 'in the direction of heaven (?)'); pacify that land.'&lt;br&gt;
:He then bequeathed to him a sword as a symbol of his commission (''shirushi-no-tsurugi''). Upon receiving the command, Amenohiwake-no-mikoto went several hundreds of ''[[Japanese units of measurement|ri]]'' east.&lt;br&gt;
:There was a ''kami'' in that area whose name was Isetsuhiko. Amenohiwake-no-mikoto asked him, 'Will you give your land to the Heavenly Grandson?'&lt;br&gt;
:He answered, 'I have sought for this land and have lived here long. I will not obey your command.'&lt;br&gt;
:Amenohiwake-no-mikoto then dispatched troops to kill that god. At once, [Isetsuhiko] gave in out of fear and said submissively, 'I surrender the whole land to the Heavenly Grandson. I will not live in it any longer.'&lt;br&gt;
:Amenohiwake-no-mikoto asked, 'When you leave, how can I be sure [of your departure]?'&lt;br&gt;
:[Isetsuhiko] said, 'Tonight I shall cause the eight winds to blow over the waters of the sea and ride the waves to go east. Thus will I depart.' Amenohiwake-no-mikoto, making ready his troops, kept watch on him.&lt;br&gt;
:Around midnight, a great wind blew from all four directions, creating strong waves shining like the sun、so that both land and sea became bright. Riding upon the waves, [Isetsuhiko] then headed east—whence comes the old saying,&lt;br&gt;
::''The land of Ise, of the [[Kamikaze (typhoon)|divine wind]], whither waves from eternal Tokoyo repair.''
:&lt;small&gt;(The god Isetsuhiko was made to live in the nearby province of Shinano.)&lt;/small&gt; Upon taming this land, Amenohiwake-no-mikoto sent word back to the Sovereign. The Sovereign, greatly pleased, ordered the land be called 'Ise' after the god of the land's name and gave it to Amenohiwake-no-mikoto to govern, granting him [[:ja:耳成村|the village of Miminashi]] in [[Yamato Province|Yamato]] as his residence."&lt;br&gt;
&lt;small&gt;(In a certain volume it is said:&lt;br&gt;
:Amenohiwake-no-mikoto, upon receiving the command, immediately went from the village of Kumano to the land of Ise. Killing the unruly ''kami'' and punishing the insubordinate, he set mountains and rivers as boundaries and established the districts of the land. Afterwards he sent word back to [[Kashihara Shrine|the palace at Kashihara]].")&lt;/small&gt;{{efn|「夫伊勢國者。天御中主尊之十二世孫。天日別命之所平。治天日別命。神倭磐餘彥天皇。自彼西宮。征此東州之時。隨天皇到紀伊國熊野村。于時隨金烏之導。入中州而到於菟田下縣。天皇敕大部日臣命曰。逆黨膽駒長髓宜早征罰。且敕天日別命曰。國有天津之方宜平其國。即賜標劒。天日別命奉敕。東入數百里。其邑有神名曰伊勢津彥。天日別命問曰。汝國獻於天孫哉。答曰。吾覓此國居住日久。不敢聞命矣。天日別命發兵欲戮其神。于時畏伏啟云。吾國悉獻於天孫。吾敢不居矣。天日別命令問云。汝之去時。何以爲驗。啟曰。吾以今夜起八風。吹海水乘波浪將東入。此則吾之却由也。天日別命整兵窺之。比及中夜。大風四起。扇擧波瀾。光耀如日。陸國海共朗。遂乘波而東焉。古語云神風伊勢國者。常世浪寄國者蓋此謂之也。&lt;small&gt;伊勢津彥神、近令住信濃國。&lt;/small&gt;天日別命、懷柔此國、復命天皇。天皇大歡詔曰。國宜取國神之名。號伊勢。即爲天日別命之之村。此國賜宅地于大倭耳梨之村焉。&lt;small&gt;或本云。天日別命奉詔自熊野村直入伊勢國。殺戮荒神。罰平不遵。堺山川定地邑。然後復命橿原宮焉。&lt;/small&gt;」}}}}

===Isetsuhiko's stone fortress===

A second excerpt from the Ise ''Fudoki''&lt;ref name="Fudoki" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kurita (1927). pp. 44-45.&lt;/ref&gt; relates another legend about the god and the origin of the name 'Ise'.

{{quote|quote=It is said in the Ise ''Fudoki'':&lt;br&gt;

:'Ise' derives from the ''kami'' residing at [[:ja:穴石神社 (伊賀市)|Anashi shrine]] in [[Iga, Mie|Iga]], Izumonotakeko-no-mikoto (出雲建子命), a son of a (or 'the') ''kami'' of [[Izumo Province|Izumo]], also known as Isetsuhiko-no-mikoto (伊勢都彦命) and Amenokushitama-no-mikoto (天櫛玉命).&lt;br&gt;
:Long ago, this god made a fortress out of stone and dwelt therein. Abeshihiko-no-kami (阿倍志彦神) came [to conquer it], but he did not prevail and so retreated. This is where [Ise] gets its name.{{efn|「伊勢國風土記云。伊勢云者。伊賀穴志社坐神。出雲神子出雲建子命。又名伊勢都彥命。又名天櫛玉命。此神昔石造城坐。於芝阿倍志彥神來集。不勝而還却。因以為名也。」}}{{efn|i.e. 'Ise' is derived from the word for 'stone fortress' (石城 ''iwa-ki'' or ''ishi-ki'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mizuno|first1=Yū|title=Nyūmon: Kofudoki jō (入門・古風土記 (上))|date=1987|publisher=Yūzankaku|isbn=978-4639006695|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}}}

==In the Harima ''Fudoki''==

Isetsuhiko-no-mikoto (伊勢都比古命) is also mentioned in passing in the ''Fudoki'' of [[Harima Province]] as the son of Iwa-no-ōkami (伊和大神), god of [[Iwa Shrine]], believed to dwell in Iseno (伊勢野, part of modern [[:ja:林田町|Hayashida-chō]], [[Himeji, Hyōgo|Himeji City]]) with his sister, Isetsuhime-no-mikoto (伊勢都比売命).&lt;ref name="Palmer"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Palmer|first1=Edwina|title=Harima Fudoki: A Record of Ancient Japan Reinterpreted, Translated, Annotated, and With Commentary|date=2015|publisher=Brill|isbn=978-90-04-26936-1|page=127|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rWzsCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA127}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Inoue|first1=Michiyasu|title=Harima-no-kuni fudoki shinkō (播磨風土記新考)|date=1931|publisher=Ōokayama-shoten|page=223|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N8f9JyeYcmEC&amp;pg=PA42-IA89}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Matsuoka|first1=Shizuo|title=Harima Fudoki monogatari (播磨風土記物語)|date=1927|publisher=Tōkō-shoin|page=56|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8ND7EJyBUjUC}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|「所以名伊勢野者。此野毎在人家。不得静安。於是衣縫猪手。漢人刀良等祖。将居此処。立社山本敬。祭在山岑神伊和大神子。伊勢都(比)古命。伊勢都比売命矣。自此以後。家々静安。遂得成里。即号伊勢(野)。」}}

==Identification with Takeminakata==
Since the [[Edo period]], a number of authors - among them the ''[[Kokugaku]]'' scholar [[Motoori Norinaga]]&lt;ref name="Norinaga1"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Motoori|first1=Norinaga|title=古事記伝 (Kojiki-den), vol. 14|date=1764–1798|url=http://dl.ndl.go.jp/info:ndljp/pid/2556374/35}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Norinaga2"&gt;Motoori, Norinaga (1937). [http://dl.ndl.go.jp/info:ndljp/pid/1109355/81 古事記傳 (''Kojiki-den''), vol. 14] in Motoori Toyokai (ed.), 本居宣長全集 (''Motoori Norinaga Zenshū''), vol. 2. Tokyo: Yoshikawa Kōbunkan. pp. 683–684. (Original work written 1764–1798)&lt;/ref&gt;  - have attempted to identify Isetsuhiko with the god [[Takeminakata]] who briefly appears in the ''[[Kojiki]]'', due to perceived parallels between the two deities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Miyachi, Naokazu|title=諏訪史 第二卷 後編 (Suwa-shi, vol. 2, part 2)|date=1931|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UHYSgY4lTZcC&amp;pg=PR178|publisher=信濃教育会諏訪部会 (Shinano kyōikukai Suwa-bukai)|pages=28–37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Isetsuhiko is said to be the son of a god of [[Izumo Province]], with his father being identified in the Harima ''Fudoki'' as Iwa-no-ōkami, a god often conflated with [[Ōkuninushi]], Takeminakata's father in the ''Kojiki''. In addition, he is also considered to be a god of the wind like Takeminakata.
*The account of Isetsuhiko's surrender to Amenohiwake shows a thematic similarity to Takeminakata's surrender to Takemikazuchi in the ''Kojiki'', both accounts even ending with the deity in question being sent to exile in [[Shinano Province]]. (Note, however, that the detail about Isetsuhiko being going to Shinano was an addition by a later hand.)

'''''Islamophobia/Islamophilia: Beyond the Politics of Enemy and Friend''''' is a 2010 book edited by Andrew Shryock, published by [[Indiana University Press]].

Schryock argues that [[Islamophilia]] and [[Islamophobia]] both come from a similar logic in Western cultures.&lt;ref name=FaddaConreyp277&gt;Fadda-Conrey, p. 277.&lt;/ref&gt;

The book originated from the first conference of the [[Islamic Studies Institute]] (ISI), which was held in 2007 at the [[University of Michigan]].&lt;ref&gt;Law, p. 156.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The editor, Andrew Schryock, is a codirector of the ISI and an Associate Professor of Anthropology of the [[University of Michigan]].&lt;ref&gt;"''[http://quod.lib.umich.edu/j/jii/4750978.0015.102/--islamophobia-islamophilia-beyond-the-politics-of-enemy?rgn=main;view=fulltext Islamophobia/Islamophilia: Beyond the Politics of Enemy and Friend]''" ([https://www.webcitation.org/6dSI2uVbQ Archive]). ''[[The Journal of the International Institute]]''. Retrieved on December 2, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contents==
The editor wrote the introduction. As the ISI is based in the United States, over half of the content is related to the U.S., and there is one chapter each about France and Germany,&lt;ref name=Lawp157&gt;Law, p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as content about Lebanon.&lt;ref name=FaddaConreyp277/&gt; Zareena A. Grewal of [[Yale University]] wrote that the wide amount of social settings and topics covered by the book is "One of the great strengths".&lt;ref&gt;Grewal, p. 218.&lt;/ref&gt; The book is divided into multiple parts.

Part I, "Continuities and Transformations":&lt;ref name=Hammerp138&gt;Hammer, p. 138.&lt;/ref&gt;
*An essay by Tomaž Mastnak - Stated that modern Islamophobia originates from a historical trajectory,&lt;ref name=Hammerp138/&gt; stemming from anti-Muslim sentiment held by European Christians&lt;ref name=FaddaConreyp278&gt;Fadda-Conrey, p. 278.&lt;/ref&gt;
*An essay by Naamah Paley - Discusses the [[Khalil Gibran International Academy]] in New York City;&lt;ref name=Lawp157/&gt; even though the school was secular, criticism was focused on a [[Yemeni American]] principal&lt;ref name=FaddaConreyp278/&gt;
Part II, "Modern (Self) Criticism"
*"The God That Failed" by Moustafa Bayoumi - In the essay he criticizes people who he refers to as neo-Orientalists,&lt;ref name=Grewalp219&gt;Grewal, p. 219.&lt;/ref&gt; including [[Reza Aslan]], [[Ayaan Hirsi Ali]], and [[Irshad Manji]];&lt;ref name=Hammerp138/&gt; he accuses them of taking advantage of prejudices already held by Western audiences.&lt;ref name=FaddaConreyp279&gt;Fadda-Conrey, p. 279.&lt;/ref&gt;
*"Gendering Islamophobia and Islamophilia: The Case of Shi‘i Muslim Women in Lebanon" by Lara Deeb&lt;ref name=Grewalp219/&gt; - Discusses [[Hezbollah]]-affiliated gender activists,&lt;ref name=Lawp157/&gt; who reside in southern Beirut, and how they face accusations of an Islamophobic character from Sunni Muslims and Christians.&lt;ref name=FaddaConreyp279/&gt;
*"Bridging Traditions: Madrasas and Their Internal Critics" by Muhammad Qasim Zaman&lt;ref name=Grewalp219/&gt; - Discusses [[madrassas]] in the Middle East and South Asia,&lt;ref name=Lawp157/&gt; and Muslim intellectual critiques of them&lt;ref name=Hammerp138139&gt;Hammer, p. 138-139.&lt;/ref&gt;
Part III, "Violence and Conversion in Europe"&lt;ref name=Hammerp139&gt;Hammer, p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt;
*"The Fantasy and Violence of Religious Imagination" by Paul Silverstein&lt;ref name=Grewalp219/&gt; - Discusses French Muslims,&lt;ref name=Lawp157/&gt; and Franco-Maghrebians,&lt;ref name=Grewalp219/&gt; and French colonial history and attitudes.&lt;ref name=FaddaConreyp280&gt;Fadda-Conrey, p. 280.&lt;/ref&gt;
*"German Converts to Islam and Their Ambivalent Relations with Immigrant Muslims" by Esra Özyürek&lt;ref name=Grewalp219/&gt; - Discusses Muslim converts in [[Berlin]],&lt;ref name=Lawp157/&gt; and how they nonetheless had negative attitudes towards [[Turkish Germans]] even though they were fellow Muslims&lt;ref name=FaddaConreyp280/&gt;
Part IV, "Attraction and Revulsion in Shared Space" - Discusses U.S. and Canadian Islamophobia&lt;ref name=Hammerp139/&gt;
*"Competing for Muslims: New Strategies for Urban Renewal" by Sally Howell&lt;ref name=Grewalp219/&gt; - Discusses school reform in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]]&lt;ref name=Grewalp219/&gt;
*An essay by [[Mucahit Bilici]] in which he discusses ethnic comedy&lt;ref name=Hammerp139/&gt;

Carol Fadda-Conrey of [[Syracuse University]] wrote that "What these essays in Islamophobia/Islamophilia make evident, both individually and collectively, is that the discourse of hate and love mobilized in constructions of Muslims as enemies and friends should be examined, and challenged, within the specific historical, local, and political frameworks from which they emerge."&lt;ref name="FaddaConreyp280"/&gt;

==Reception==
Grewal stated that "Overall, the volume is an impressive collection of serious discursive analyses that heighten our sensitivities to the forms arguments about Islam take".&lt;ref name=Grewalp219/&gt;

Ian Law of the School of Sociology and Social Policy of the [[University of Leeds]] stated that the book was an "excellent collection" that "contains vivid case study material" and that "should be recognized for both its new approach to theorizing the complex and ambivalent relations between Muslims and non-Muslims, and for advancing our understanding of how to move forward in this field."&lt;ref name=Lawp157/&gt;

Juliane Hammer of the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]] wrote that the book successfully integrates the individual essays together,&lt;ref name=Hammerp139/&gt; and that the book is "highly recommended for a range of scholars and students in disciplines interested in identity construction, dynamics of media representations, the interplay of religious self-understanding, praxis, and public perception, and the implications of "Islam and modernity" discourses in contemporary global politics.&lt;ref&gt;Hammer, p. 139-140.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Jewish National Bloc''' ({{lang-lv|Ebreju nacionālais bloks}}) was a political alliance in [[Latvia]] in the 1920s. It consisted of Histadruth Hacionith, the Jewish National Democratic Party and [[Mizrachi (Latvia)|Mizrachi]].&lt;ref name=NS&gt;[[Dieter Nohlen]] &amp; Philip Stöver (2010) ''Elections in Europe: A data handbook'', p1134 {{ISBN|978-3-8329-5609-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The bloc contested the [[Latvian Constitutional Assembly election, 1920|1920 Constitutional Assembly elections]] as the '''Jewish Bloc''', winning five seats.&lt;ref&gt;Nohlen &amp; Stöver, p1137&lt;/ref&gt; For the [[Latvian parliamentary election, 1922|1922 elections]] it changed its name to the '''Jewish National Bloc''', but won only two seats in the [[1st Saeima]]. The bloc was later disbanded, with the three parties contesting the [[Latvian parliamentary election, 1925|1925 elections]] alone. Mizrachi won a single seat in the [[2nd Saeima]], whilst the other two failed to pass the [[electoral threshold]].

'''John Gray''' (born December 28, 1951) is an American relationship counselor, lecturer and author. In 1969, he began a nine-year association with [[Maharishi Mahesh Yogi]] before beginning his career as an author and personal relationship counselor. In 1992 he published the book ''[[Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus]]'', which became a long term best seller and formed the central theme of all his subsequent books and career activities. His books have sold millions of copies.

==Early life and education==

In 1997, Gray began opening Mars &amp; Venus Counseling Centers, where he trains therapists in his "Mars &amp; Venus technique" in exchange for a one time licensing fee and monthly "royalty payments". [[Dorothy Cantor]], a former president of the [[American Psychological Association]], has questioned the ethics of creating a franchise for what is essentially a therapeutic process.&lt;ref name="Time"/&gt;

===Interviews and appearances===
Gray has made numerous media appearances including ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show|Oprah]]'', ''[[The Phil Donahue Show]]'',&lt;ref name="Guardian"/&gt; and ''[[Larry King Live]].''

In a June 2014 interview with [[Agence France-Presse]], Gray was quoted as saying with regard to [[feminism]], "The reason why there's so much divorce is that feminism promotes independence in women. I'm very happy for women to find greater independence, but when you go too far in that direction, then who's at home?"&lt;ref name=2014AFPInterview&gt;{{cite web |last1=Staff |title='Mars, Venus' author warns over sex in online world |url=http://www.afp.com/en/node/2470223 |website=[[AFP.com]] |publisher=[[Agence France-Presse]]] |accessdate=9 June 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140609181028/http://www.afp.com/en/node/2470223 |archivedate=June 9, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also stated that "feminism in America holds back sales of [his] books", while other parts of the world - he cited Australia and Latin America notably - are more in tune with his basic message.&lt;ref name=2014NZHerald&gt;{{cite web|last1=Staff|title=Feminism and free porn are ruining relationships - author|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/lifestyle/news/article.cfm?c_id=6&amp;objectid=11268800|website=nzherald.co.nz|publisher=New Zealand Herald|accessdate=9 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; With regard to [[online pornography]] Gray stated, "With free internet porn, there's a massive addiction happening," adding that there are "just millions and millions of people... experiencing their sexual satisfactions through total fantasy. The effect that porn has on the brain is like taking heroin." With regard to the rise of infidelity sites like [[Ashley Madison]] and [[Arrangement Finders]] he states, "When you have impersonal sex.... 'It's OK, here are these cheating wives, men, they want to have sex with you'... So you go have sex with someone that you don't know and someone you don't love... impersonal sex does promote addiction to sex," he adds, "it's along the same line of pornography."&lt;ref name=2014AFPInterview/&gt;&lt;ref name=2014AVNGrayInterviews&gt;{{cite web|last1=Staff|title='Men Are From Mars' Author Blames Free Online Porn, Feminists|url=http://business.avn.com/articles/video/Men-Are-From-Mars-Author-Blames-Free-Online-Porn-Feminists-563972.html|website=AVN.com|publisher=Adult Video News|accessdate=9 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
In 2002, author [[Julia T.

Gray was accused of borrowing from the work of author [[Deborah Tannen]] and he acknowledges some similarities but says, "I was teaching those ideas before I'd heard of her" and that he did not read her book.&lt;ref&gt;Conversation with HarperCollins editor Nancy Peske, 1994&lt;/ref&gt; Other critics have accused Gray of limiting human psychology to [[stereotypes]].&lt;ref name="GM"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2002/feb/14/20020214-035728-1618r/ |title=Mars and Venus at work; Critics aim to bring Gray back down to Earth |last=Murphy |first=Lauren |date=February 14, 2002 |newspaper=[[The Washington Times]] |accessdate=January 7, 2014}} = [http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-83549879.html ''Mars and Venus at work; Critics aim to bring Gray back down to Earth''].

[[File:KarlHaushofer RudolfHess.jpg|thumb|325px|General Karl Haushofer and [[Rudolf Hess]], c.1920]]

'''Karl Ernst Haushofer''' (27 August 1869&amp;nbsp;– 10 March 1946) was a German general, geographer and politician. Through his student [[Rudolf Hess]], Haushofer's ideas influenced the development of [[Adolf Hitler]]'s expansionist strategies, although Haushofer denied direct influence on the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi regime]]. Under the [[Nuremberg Laws]], Haushofer's wife and children were categorized as ''[[Mischling]]e''. His son, [[Albrecht Haushofer|Albrecht]], was issued a [[German Blood Certificate]] through the help of Hess.

==Life and career==
{{refimprovesect|date=May 2018}}
Haushofer belonged to a family of artists and scholars. He was born in [[Munich]] to Max Haushofer, a professor of economics, and Adele Haushofer (née Fraas). On his graduation from the Munich Gymnasium (high school), Haushofer contemplated an academic career. However, service with the [[Bavarian Army]] proved so interesting that he stayed to work, with great success, as an instructor in military academies and on the general staff.

In 1887, Haushofer entered the 1st Field Artillery regiment "Prinzregent Luitpold" and completed ''[[Kriegsschule (Wehrmacht)|Kriegsschule]]'', ''Artillerieschule'' and ''[[War Academy (Kingdom of Bavaria)]]''. In 1896, he married Martha Mayer-Doss (1877–1946) whose father was Jewish. They had two sons, [[Albrecht Haushofer]] and Heinz Haushofer (1906–1988).

Haushofer continued his career as a professional soldier, serving in the army of [[Imperial Germany]] and rising through the Staff Corp by 1899. In 1903, he began teaching at the Bavarian ''War Academy''.

In November 1908, the army sent him to [[Tokyo]] to study the [[Japan]]ese [[Imperial Japanese Army|army]] and to advise it as an [[artillery]] instructor. He travelled with his wife via India and South East Asia and arrived in February 1909. He was received by the Japanese emperor and became acquainted with many important people in politics and the armed forces. In autumn 1909, he travelled with his wife for a month to [[Korean Empire|Korea]] and [[Manchuria]] on the occasion of a railway construction. In June 1910, they returned to Germany via [[Russia]] and arrived one month later.

Shortly afterwards, he began to suffer from several severe diseases and was given a leave from the army for three years. From 1911 to 1913, Haushofer would work on his [[Ph.D.|doctorate of philosophy]] from [[Munich University]] for a thesis on Japan titled ''Dai Nihon, Betrachtungen über Groß-Japans Wehrkraft, Weltstellung und Zukunft'' ("Reflections on Greater Japan's Military Strength, World Position, and Future"). By [[World War I]], he had attained the rank of [[General]], and commanded a [[brigade]] on the [[Western Front (World War I)|western front]]. He became disillusioned after Germany's loss and severe sanctioning; he retired with the rank of major general in 1919. At this time, he forged a friendship with the young [[Rudolf Hess]], who would become his scientific assistant.

Haushofer entered academia with the aim of restoring and regenerating Germany. Haushofer believed the Germans' lack of geographical knowledge and geopolitical awareness to be a major cause of Germany’s defeat in World War I, as Germany had found itself with a disadvantageous alignment of allies and enemies. The fields of political and geographical science thus became his areas of specialty. In 1919, Haushofer became [[Privatdozent]] for [[political geography]] at Munich University and in 1933 professor.

[[Louis Pauwels]], in his book ''Monsieur Gurdjieff'', describes Haushofer as a former student of [[George Gurdjieff]]. Others, including Pauwels, said that Haushofer created a [[Vril#Vril Society|Vril society]] and that he was a secret member of the [[Thule Society]].&lt;ref&gt;Pauwels, Louis and Bergier, Jacques. ''The Morning of the Magicians''. Avon Books, 1973&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stefan Zweig]] speaks warmly of him &lt;ref&gt;[[Stefan Zweig|Zweig, Stefan]]. ''[[The World of Yesterday]]'' New York: Viking, 1943&lt;/ref&gt; but says history will have to judge how far he knowingly contributed to Nazi doctrine, as more documentation becomes available. Zweig credits him with the concept of [[Lebensraum]], used in a psychological sense of a nation's relative energies.

After the establishment of the Nazi regime, Haushofer remained friendly with Hess, who protected Haushofer and his wife from the racial laws of the Nazis{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}, which deemed her a "half-Jew". During the prewar years, Haushofer was instrumental in linking Japan to the [[Axis powers of World War II|Axis powers]], acting in accordance with the theories of his book ''Geopolitics of the Pacific Ocean''.

After the [[July 20 Plot]] to assassinate Hitler, Haushofer's son [[Albrecht Haushofer|Albrecht]] (1903–1945) went into hiding but was arrested on 7 December 1944 and put into the [[Moabit]] prison in [[Berlin]]. During the night of 22–23 April 1945, he and other selected prisoners, such as [[Klaus Bonhoeffer]], were walked out of the prison by an [[SS]]-squad and were shot. Beginning on 24 September 1945, Karl Haushofer was informally interrogated by Father [[Edmund A. Walsh]] on behalf of the Allied forces to determine whether he should stand trial at Nuremberg for war crimes; Walsh determined that he had not committed any.

On the night of 10–11 March 1946, he and his wife committed suicide in a secluded hollow on their Hartschimmelhof estate at [[Pähl]]/Ammersee. Both drank [[arsenic]] and his wife then hanged herself while Haushofer was obviously too weak to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,888139,00.html |title=Germany: Haushofer's Heritage |newspaper=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=March 25, 1946 |accessdate=2012-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Walsh, Edmund A. [https://books.google.com/books?id=WEkEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA107 "The Mystery of Haushofer"] ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' (September 16, 1946) pp. 107–120&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geopolitics==
{{Main|Geopolitik}}

Haushofer developed Geopolitik from widely varied sources, including the writings of [[Oswald Spengler]], [[Alexander Humboldt]], [[Carl Ritter|Karl Ritter]], [[Friedrich Ratzel]], [[Rudolf Kjellén]], and [[Halford J. Mackinder]].&lt;ref name="Geopolitics of the World System"&gt;{{cite web|author=Saul Bernard Cohen|title=Geopolitics of the World System|year=2003|publisher=Rowman and Littlefield Publishers Inc|ISBN=0-8476-9907-2 |pages=21–23|accessdate=2014-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Geopolitik contributed to Nazi foreign policy chiefly in the strategy and justifications for [[lebensraum]]. The theories contributed five ideas to German foreign policy in the [[interwar period]]:
* [[organic state]]
* [[lebensraum]]
* [[autarky]]
* [[pan-region]]s
* land power/[[sea power]] [[dichotomy]].

Geostrategy as a [[political science]] is both descriptive and analytical like political geography but adds a [[norm (sociology)|normative]] element in its strategic prescriptions for national policy.&lt;ref&gt;Mattern, pp.40–41&lt;/ref&gt; While some of Haushofer's ideas stem from earlier American and British [[geostrategy]], German geopolitik adopted an essentialist outlook toward the national interest, oversimplifying issues and representing itself as a [[panacea]].&lt;ref name="Walsh41"/&gt; As a new and essentialist [[ideology]], geopolitik found itself in a position to prey upon the [[Weimar Republic|post-World War I insecurity]] of the populace.&lt;ref name = Matern32&gt;Mattern, p.32&lt;/ref&gt;

Haushofer's position in the [[University of Munich]] served as a platform for the spread of his geopolitical ideas, magazine articles, and books. In 1922, he founded the Institute of Geopolitics in Munich, from which he proceeded to publicize geopolitical ideas. By 1924, as the leader of the German geopolitik school of thought, Haushofer would establish the ''Zeitschrift für Geopolitik'' monthly devoted to geopolitik. His ideas would reach a wider audience with the publication of ''Volk ohne Raum'' by [[Hans Grimm]] in 1926, popularizing his concept of lebensraum.&lt;ref&gt;Dorpalen, pp.16–17&lt;/ref&gt; Haushofer exercised influence both through his academic teachings, urging his students to think in terms of [[continent]]s and emphasizing motion in [[international politics]], and through his political activities.&lt;ref&gt;Walsh (1949), pp.4–5&lt;/ref&gt; While Hitler's speeches would attract the masses, Haushofer's works served to bring the remaining [[intellectual]]s into the fold.&lt;ref name="Beukema, pxiii"&gt;Beukema, Col. Herman. "Introduction" to Dorpalen, p.xiii&lt;/ref&gt;

Geopolitik was essentially a consolidation and codification of older ideas, given a scientific gloss:

*[[Lebensraum]] was a revised colonial imperialism;
*Autarky a new expression of tariff [[protectionism]];
*Strategic control of key geographic territories exhibiting the same thought behind earlier designs on the [[Suez Canal|Suez]] and [[Panama Canal]]s; a view of controlling the land in the same way as those choke points control the sea
*Pan-regions (''Panideen'') based upon the [[British Empire]], and the American [[Monroe Doctrine]], [[Pan-American Union]] and [[hemispheric defense]],&lt;ref&gt;Mattern, p.37&lt;/ref&gt; whereby the world is divided into spheres of influence.
*Frontiers&amp;nbsp;– His view of barriers between peoples not being political (borders) or natural placements of races or ethnicities but as being fluid and determined by the will or needs of ethnic/racial groups.
The key reorientation in each [[:wikt:dyad|dyad]] is that the focus is on land-based [[empire]] rather than naval imperialism.

Ostensibly based upon the geopolitical theory of [[United States Navy|American naval]] expert [[Alfred Thayer Mahan]], and British geographer [[Halford J. Mackinder]], German geopolitik adds older German ideas. Enunciated most forcefully by Friedrich Ratzel and his Swedish student Rudolf Kjellén, they include an organic or [[anthropomorphize]]d conception of the state, and the need for self-sufficiency through the top-down organization of society.&lt;ref name = Matern32/&gt; The root of uniquely German geopolitik rests in the writings of Karl Ritter who first developed the [[organic state|organic conception of the state]] that would later be elaborated upon by Ratzel and accepted by Hausfhofer. He justified lebensraum, even at the cost of other nations' existence because conquest was a biological necessity for a state's growth.&lt;ref&gt;Walsh (1949), p.39&lt;/ref&gt;

Ratzel's writings coincided with the [[Second Industrial Revolution#Germany|growth of German industrialism]] after the [[Franco-Prussian war]] and the subsequent search for markets that brought it into competition with [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]]. His writings served as welcome justification for imperial expansion.&lt;ref&gt;Mattern, p.60&lt;/ref&gt; Influenced by Mahan, Ratzel wrote of aspirations for German naval reach, agreeing that sea power was self-sustaining, as the profit from trade would pay for the [[merchant marine]], unlike land power.&lt;ref&gt;Dorpalen, pp.66–67&lt;/ref&gt; Haushofer was exposed to Ratzel, who was friends with Haushofer's father, a teacher of [[economic geography]],&lt;ref&gt;Dorpalen, p.52&lt;/ref&gt; and would integrate Ratzel's ideas on the division between sea and land powers into his theories, saying that only a country with both could overcome this conflict.&lt;ref&gt;Dorpalen, pp.68–69&lt;/ref&gt;

Haushofer's geopolitik expands upon that of Ratzel and Kjellén. While the latter two conceive of geopolitik as the state as an organism in space put to the service of a leader, Haushofer's Munich school specifically studies geography as it relates to [[war]] and designs for [[empire]].&lt;ref&gt;Dorpalen, pp.23–24&lt;/ref&gt; The behavioral rules of previous geopoliticians were thus turned into dynamic normative [[doctrine]]s for action on lebensraum and world power.&lt;ref&gt;Dorpalen, p.54&lt;/ref&gt;

Haushofer defined geopolitik in 1935 as "the duty to safeguard the right to the soil, to the land in the widest sense, not only the land within the frontiers of the [[Reich]], but the right to [[Volksdeutsche|the more extensive ''Volk'']] and cultural lands."&lt;ref&gt;Walsh (1949), p.48&lt;/ref&gt; Culture itself was seen as the most conducive element to dynamic special expansion. It provided a guide as to the best areas for expansion, and could make expansion safe, whereas projected [[military]] or [[commerce|commercial]] power could not.&lt;ref&gt;Dorpalen, p.80&lt;/ref&gt; Haushofer even held that [[urbanization]] was a symptom of a nation's decline, evidencing a decreasing soil mastery, [[birthrate]] and effectiveness of centralized rule.&lt;ref&gt;Dorpalen, p.78&lt;/ref&gt;

To Haushofer, the existence of a state depended on living space, the pursuit of which must serve as the basis for all policies. Germany had a high [[population density]], but the old colonial powers had a much lower density, a virtual [[mandate (politics)|mandate]] for German expansion into resource-rich areas.&lt;ref&gt;Dorpalen, pp.38–39&lt;/ref&gt; Space was seen as military protection against initial assaults from hostile neighbors with long-range weaponry. A buffer zone of territories or insignificant states on one's borders would serve to protect Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Dorpalen, pp.94–95&lt;/ref&gt; Closely linked to that need was Haushofer's assertion that the existence of small states was evidence of political regression and disorder in the [[international relations|international system]]. The small states surrounding Germany ought to be brought into the vital German order.&lt;ref&gt;Dorpalen, pp.205–06&lt;/ref&gt; These states were seen as being too small to maintain practical [[Wiktionary:autonomy|autonomy]] even if they maintained large colonial possessions and would be better served by protection and organization within Germany. In Europe, he saw [[Belgium]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Portugal]], [[Denmark]], [[Switzerland]], [[Greece]] and the "mutilated alliance" of [[Austro-Hungary]] as supporting his assertion.&lt;ref&gt;Dorpalen, pp.207, 209&lt;/ref&gt;

Haushofer's version of autarky was based on the quasi-[[Malthusian]] idea that the earth would become saturated with people and no longer able to provide food for all. There would essentially be no increases in [[productivity (economics)|productivity]].&lt;ref&gt;Dorpalen, p.231&lt;/ref&gt;

Haushofer and the Munich school of geopolitik would eventually expand their conception of lebensraum and autarky well past the borders of 1914 and "a place in the sun" to a [[Neuropa|New European Order]], then to a New Afro-European Order, and eventually to a [[Eurasia]]n Order.&lt;ref&gt;Mattern, p.17&lt;/ref&gt; That concept became known as a pan-region, taken from the American Monroe Doctrine, and the idea of national and continental self-sufficiency.&lt;ref&gt;Mattern, p.39&lt;/ref&gt; That was a forward-looking refashioning of the drive for [[colony|colonies]], something that geopoliticians did not see as an economic necessity but more as a matter of prestige, putting pressure on older colonial powers. The fundamental motivating force would be not economic but cultural and spiritual.&lt;ref&gt;Dorpalen, pp.235-6&lt;/ref&gt; Haushofer was, what is called today, a proponent of "[[Eurasia Party|Eurasianism]]", advocating a policy of German–Russian hegemony and alliance to offset an Anglo-American power structure's potentially dominating influence in Europe.

Beyond being an economic concept, pan-regions were a strategic concept as well. Haushofer acknowledges the strategic concept of the [[Heartland Theory]] put forward by the British geopolitician Halford Mackinder.&lt;ref&gt;Dorpalen, p.218&lt;/ref&gt; If Germany could control Eastern Europe and subsequently Russian territory, it could control a strategic area to which hostile seapower could be denied.&lt;ref&gt;Mackinder, p.78&lt;/ref&gt; Allying with [[Italy]] and [[Japan]] would further augment German strategic control of Eurasia, with those states becoming the naval arms protecting Germany's insular position.&lt;ref&gt;Walsh (1949), p.9&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contacts with Nazi leadership==

Evidence points to a disconnect between the advocates of geopolitik and Hitler, although their practical tactical goals were nearly indistinguishable.&lt;ref name="Beukema, pxiii"/&gt;

[[Rudolf Hess]], Hitler's secretary who would assist in the writing of ''[[Mein Kampf]]'', was a close student of Haushofer's. While Hess and Hitler were imprisoned after the [[Munich Beer Hall Putsch]] in 1923, Haushofer spent six hours visiting the two, bringing along a copy of Friedrich Ratzel's ''Political Geography'' and [[Carl von Clausewitz|Clausewitz]]'s ''[[On War]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Walsh (1949), pp.14–15&lt;/ref&gt; After [[World War II]], Haushofer would deny that he had taught Hitler, and claimed that the [[National Socialist German Workers Party|National Socialist Party]] perverted Hess's study of geopolitik. Hitler's biographers disagree somewhat on the extent of Haushofer's influence on Hitler: [[Ian Kershaw]] writes that "[his] influence was probably greater than the Munich professor was later prepared to acknowledge,"&lt;ref&gt;[[Ian Kershaw|Kershaw, Ian]] ''Hitler: 1889-1936: Hubris'' New York: Norton, 1998. pp.248-249. {{ISBN|0-393-04671-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Joachim C. Fest]] says that "Hitler's version of [Haushofer's] ideas was distinctly his own."&lt;ref&gt;[[Joachim C, Fest|Fest, Joachim C.]] and [[Richard and Clara Winston|Winston, Richard and Winston, Clara]] (trans.) ''Hitler''. New York: Vantage, 1975. (orig. published in German in 1973), p.217. {{ISBN|0-394-72023-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Haushofer himself viewed Hitler as a half-educated man who never correctly understood the geopolitik principles explained by Hess, and saw Foreign Minister [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]] as the principal distorter of geopolitik in Hitler's mind.&lt;ref&gt;Walsh (1949), p.15&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Haushofer accompanied Hess on numerous [[propaganda]] missions, and participated in consultations between Nazis and Japanese leaders, he claimed that Hitler and the Nazis only seized upon half-developed ideas and  [[Catchphrase|catchwords]].&lt;ref&gt;Walsh (1949), p.8&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the Nazi party and government lacked any official organ that was receptive to geopolitik, leading to selective adoption and poor interpretation of Haushofer's theories. Ultimately, Hess and [[Konstantin von Neurath]], Nazi Minister of Foreign Affairs, were the only officials Haushofer would admit had a proper understanding of geopolitik.&lt;ref&gt;Walsh (1949), pp.35–36&lt;/ref&gt;

Father [[Edmund A. Walsh]], professor of [[geopolitics]] and [[dean (education)|dean]] at [[Georgetown University]], who interviewed Haushofer after the [[V-E Day|allied victory]] in preparation for the [[Nuremberg trials]], disagreed with Haushofer's assessment that geopolitik was terribly distorted by Hitler and the Nazis.&lt;ref name = Walsh41&gt;Walsh (1949), p.41&lt;/ref&gt; He cites Hitler's speeches declaring that small states have no right to exist, and the Nazi use of Haushofer's maps, language and arguments. Even if distorted somewhat, Walsh felt that was enough to implicate Haushofer's geopolitik.&lt;ref&gt;Walsh (1949), pp.41, 17&lt;/ref&gt;

Haushofer also denied assisting Hitler in writing ''Mein Kampf'', saying that he only knew of it once it was in print, and never read it.&lt;ref&gt;Walsh (1949), p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; Walsh found that even if Haushofer did not directly assist Hitler, discernible new elements appeared in ''Mein Kampf'', as compared to previous speeches made by Hitler. Geopolitical ideas of lebensraum, space for depth of defense, appeals for [[natural frontier]]s, balancing land and seapower, and geographic analysis of [[military strategy]] entered Hitler's thought between his imprisonment and publishing of ''Mein Kampf''.&lt;ref name = Walsh41/&gt; Chapter XIV, on German policy in [[Eastern Europe]], in particular displays the influence of the materials Haushofer brought Hitler and Hess while they were imprisoned.&lt;ref&gt;Walsh (1949), p.42&lt;/ref&gt;

Haushofer was never a member of the Nazi Party, and did voice disagreements with the party, leading to his brief imprisonment. Haushofer came under suspicion because of his contacts with left wing socialist figures within the Nazi movement (led by [[Gregor Strasser]]) and his advocacy of essentially a German–Russian alliance. This Nazi left wing had some connections to the [[Communist Party of Germany]] and some of its leaders, especially those who were influenced by the [[National Bolshevism|National Bolshevist]] philosophy of a German–Russian revolutionary alliance, as advocated by [[Ernst Niekisch]], [[Julius Evola]], [[Ernst Jünger]], Hielscher and other figures of the "conservative revolution." He did profess loyalty to the [[Führer]] and make [[anti-Semitism|anti-Semitic]] remarks on occasion. However, his emphasis was always on space over [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], believing in [[Environmental determinism|environmental]] rather than racial determinism.&lt;ref&gt;Mattern, p.20&lt;/ref&gt; He refused to associate himself with anti-Semitism as a policy, especially because his wife was half-Jewish.&lt;ref&gt;Walsh (1949), pp.40, 35&lt;/ref&gt; Haushofer admits that after 1933 much of what he wrote was distorted under duress: his wife had to be protected by Hess's influence (who managed to have her awarded 'honorary German' status); his son was implicated in the July 20 plot to assassinate Hitler and was executed by the [[Gestapo]]; he himself was imprisoned in [[Dachau concentration camp]] for eight months; and his son and grandson were imprisoned for two-and-a-half months.&lt;ref&gt;Walsh (1949), p.16&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of contact between Haushofer and the Nazi establishment has been stressed by several authors.&lt;ref&gt;for example:

*Berzin, Alexander. [http://studybuddhism.com/en/advanced-studies/history-culture/shambhala/the-nazi-connection-with-shambhala-and-tibet "The Nazi Connection with Shambhala and Tibet"] (May 2003)
*FitzGerald, Michael. ''Storm Troopers of Satan'' (Robert Hale, 1990)
*FitzGerald, Michael. ''Adolf Hitler: A Portrait'' (Spellmount, 2006)
*Sklar, Dusty. ''The Nazis and the Occult'' (Dorset Press, 1977)
*Webb, James. ''The Occult Establishment'' (Richard Drew, 1981)&lt;/ref&gt; These authors have expanded Haushofer's contact with Hitler to a close collaboration while Hitler was writing ''[[Mein Kampf]]'' and made him one of the 'future Chancellor's many mentors'. Haushofer may have been a short-term student of [[Gurdjieff]], that he had studied [[Zen Buddhism]], and that he had been initiated at the hands of [[Tibet]]an [[lama]]s, although these notions are debated.

The influence of Haushofer on Nazi ideology is dramatized in the 1943 short documentary film, ''[[Plan for Destruction]]'', which was nominated for an Academy Award.

'''Kodiyettru Thirunal''' is the festival celebrated in [[Swamithoppepathi]] for eleven days by the followers of the [[Ayyavazhi]]. This is celebrated three times annually during the Tamil months of [[Tamil calendar|Aavani]], [[Tamil calendar|Thai]] and [[Tamil calendar|Vaikaasi]]. The festival for the month of Vaikasi is considered the most sacred and is celebrated in a grand scale. 

The festival starts on the first Friday of Avani and Thai. In Vaikasi, the festival begins on the second Friday of the month. The festival starts with the hoisting of the Saffron coloured holy Flag, early in the morning. In the evening the elunetru is carried around the Pathi and through the four car streets in Vahanas.

{{Hinduism}}
'''Hinduism''' is the dominant and native/original [[religion]] of the [[Indian subcontinent]]. It comprises three major traditions, [[Saivism]],[[Vaishnavism]] and [[Shaktism]],{{sfn|Nath|2001|p=31}} whose followers considered [[Shiva]], [[Vishnu]] and [[Shakti]] (also called as [[Devi]]) to be the supreme deity respectively. Most of the other deities were either related to them or different forms (incarnations) of these deities. [[Hinduism]] has been called the "[[oldest religion]]" in the world, and many practitioners refer to Hinduism as "the eternal [[dharma|law]]". (''{{IAST|Sanātana Dharma}}'').{{sfn|Knott|1998|p=5}} Given below is a list of the chief Hindu deities followed by a list of Hindu deities (including demi-gods).
[[Smartism]], an older tradition and later reestablished by Jagadguru Adi Shankaracharya, invites the worship of more than one god including Shiva like that, Vishnu, Brahma, Shakti and  
Ganesha (the elephant god)  among other gods and goddesses. It is not as overtly sectarian as either Vashnavism or Saivism and is based on the recognition that [[Brahman]] (God) is the highest principle in the universe and pervades all of existence.&lt;ref name="Himalaya Academy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.himalayanacademy.com/readlearn/basics/four-sects|title=The Four Denominations of Hinduism  |accessdate=7 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Iskcon&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iskconeducationalservices.org/HoH/tradition/1200.htm|title=The Four Main Denominations|accessdate=7 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hindus in SA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hinduism.co.za/hindu3.htm|title=Hindu Sects |accessdate=7 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dubois"&gt;{{cite book|last=Dubois|title=Hindu Manners, Customs and Ceremonies|publisher=Cosimo|page=111|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4zMY2qURR-8C&amp;pg=PA111&amp;dq=hindu+sects&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=MLD0UpvBNsLulAXmq4C4DA&amp;ved=0CDsQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=hindu%20sects&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Main deities==
The Hindu [[Trimurti|trinity]] consists of [[Brahma]] the Creator, [[Vishnu]] the Preserver, and [[Shiva]] the Destroyer. Their feminine counterparts are [[Saraswati]], the wife of Brahma, [[Lakshmi]], the wife of Vishnu, and [[Parvati]] the wife of Shiva. The followers of the last two form two major sects. 

===Devi (goddess)===
{{main|Devi}}

Cults of goddess worship are ancient in India. In the Rigveda, the most prominent goddess is Ushas, the goddess of dawn. In modern Hinduism, goddesses are widely revered. [[Shaktism]] is one of the major sects of Hinduism. Followers of Shaktism believe that the goddess ([[Devi]]) is the power ([[Shakti]]) that underlies the female principle, and that Devi is the supreme being, one and the same with [[Para Brahman]]. Devi is believed to manifest in peaceful forms, such as Parvati the consort of Shiva and Lakshmi the consort of Vishnu, and also in fierce forms, such as Kali and Durga. In Shaktism, [[Adi Parashakti]] is regarded as Ultimate Godhead or [[Para Brahman]]. She is formless i.e. [[Nirguna]] in reality, but may take many forms i.e. Saguna. [[Durga]] and Lalita [[Tripura Sundari|Tripurasundari]] are regarded as the Supreme goddess in the Kalikula and Srikula systems respectively. Shaktism is closely related with Tantric Hinduism, which teaches rituals and practices for purification of the mind and body.&lt;ref name="Himalaya Academy"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Iskcon/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hindus in SA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dubois"/&gt; Some different forms of [[Shakti]] (Devi) the Mother Goddess:
* [[Durga]] and her [[navadurgas]]
* [[Kali]](as[[Bhadrakali]], an auspicious form of [[Kali]] and [[Bharavi]]/[[Chamundikeshwari]][often known as [[Chandi]]], as a ferocious form) and her 10 [[mahavidyas]]
* [[Lakshmi]] and her [[ashtalakshmi]]
* [[Parvati]]
* [[Saraswati]] and [[Matrikas]]
* [[Gayatri]],the supreme life giving goddess.
* [[Ganges in Hinduism|Ganga]], the goddess personification of the Ganges River.
* [[Tulsi]],the personified godly form of Tulsi plant.
* [[Annapurna Devi Mata|Annapoorna]]
* [[Santoshi Mata]],Considered to be the goddess of happiness and long life and the daughter of Ganesha.
* [[Abirami]],a goddess of boons who is considered to be the incarnation of Lord Shakti who is widely worshiped in south India.

===Shiva===
{{Main|Shiva}}
[[Shaivism]] is one of the major Hindu sects. Adherents of Shaivism believe that the god Shiva is the supreme being. Shiva is the destroyer god among the [[Trimurti]], and so is sometimes depicted as the fierce god [[Bhairava]]. Shaivists are more attracted to asceticism than adherents of other Hindu sects, and may be found wandering with ashen faces performing self-purification rituals.&lt;ref name="Himalaya Academy" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Iskcon" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hindus in SA" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Dubois" /&gt; Some alternative forms of Shiva:

===Brahma ===
As compared to other Hindu deities,Brahma is considered to be less significant yet worshipped by some North Indian Brahmins. As Brahma worships to Lord [[Shiva]] so following to him they also like [[Shaiva]] worships to Shiva. It is said that Brahma was punished by Lord Shiva in the form of Bhairavnath that he would not be worshipped by any being on the earth and he would not have temples on earth. According to Hindu mythology,Brahma is considered to be the creator of the entire cosmos. Some alternative forms of Brahma are:

Most of the Hindu temples are dedicated to [[Shiva|Siva]], [[Vishnu]] (including his incarnations [[Krishna]] and [[Rama]]), [[Brahma]], [[Shakti]] (the mother goddess, hence including the forms of [[Durga]] and [[Kali]] and the goddesses [[Lakshmi]] and [[Saraswati]]), [[Ganesh]] and [[Hanuman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sanatansociety.org/hindu_gods_and_goddesses.htm#.UvSQeEKSy18|title=Hindu Gods &amp; Goddesses |publisher=Sanatan Society|accessdate=7 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hinduism|url=http://hinduism.about.com/od/godsgoddesses/tp/deities.htm|publisher=About.com|accessdate=7 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hindu gods and goddesses|url=http://www.usefulcharts.com/religion/main-hindu-gods-chart.html|publisher=usefulcharts|accessdate=7 February 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203215148/http://www.usefulcharts.com/religion/main-hindu-gods-chart.html|archivedate=3 February 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Hinduism|Hindu]] scriptures claimed that there were '''33 KOTI''' or '''33 category''' gods, ''koti'' meaning in Sanskrit ''crore'' (33 कोटि  = 10 prakar, tarah ). Crore also translates to 10,000,000 or 10 million.

One theory is that the number 330 million (33 crore) gods refers to the total count of the then known population of all the humans and living beings that ever walked on this planet including the 84 lakh (8.4 million) jeeva rasi (living species) signifying that god exists in every living being. This is in line with the belief of Indians to respect all living beings as gods. It is estimated that the world population was around this number about a 1000 years ago when this number would have originated. It also explains the many gods (e.g. the grama devatas or village gods who were clearly living persons at one time and many of the other gods who were believed to have been persons, e.g. Rama and Krishna)

Another theory is that the number might be figurative but there are several names and forms for the multitude of gods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lynn Foulston, Stuart Abbott|title=Hindu goddesses: beliefs and practices|pages=1–2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XgwVgPx5G5UC&amp;pg=PA2&amp;dq=%22330+million%22+infinity&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=hheXTpuMNfHb4QSFxpWkBA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22330%20million%22%20infinity&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Given below is an incomplete list of deities.

Most human civilizations - [[History of India|India]], [[History of China|China]], [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]], [[Ancient Near East|Mesopotamia]], [[Maya civilization|Maya]], and [[Inca Empire|Inca]], among others - based their culture on complex systems of [[astrology]], which provided a link between the cosmos with the conditions and events on earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ayurvedic Astrology: Self-healing Through the Stars|last=Frawley|first=David|publisher=Lotus Press|year=2005|isbn=8120831349|location=Twin Lakes, Wisconsin|pages=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; For these, the astrological practice was not mere divination because it also served as the foundation for their spiritual culture and knowledge-systems used for practical purposes such as the calendar (see [[Mesoamerica|Mesoamerican]] calendrical shamans&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Astrology through History: Interpreting the Stars from Ancient Mesopotamia to the Present|last=Burns|first=William|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year=2018|isbn=9781440851421|location=Santa Barbara, CA|pages=225}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and medicine (e.g. ''[[I Ching]]''). Astrological tradition even contributed to the development of [[astronomy]] as the study of the skies provided invaluable insights about celestial bodies. For instance, the [[Ptolemaic Kingdom|Ptolemaic]] astrological tradition has already listed some of the planets in the [[Solar System|solar system]] and their movements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sefer Ḥakhmoni|last=Mancuso|first=Piergabriele|publisher=BRILL|year=2010|isbn=9789004167629|location=Leiden|pages=321}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Maban''' or '''Mabain''' is a material that is held to be [[magic (paranormal)|magic]]al in [[Australian Aboriginal mythology]]. It is the material from which the [[shaman]]s and elders of indigenous Australia supposedly derive their magical powers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mudrooroo |doi=10.1080/02560049685310111 |title=Maban reality and shape-shifting the past: Strategies to sing the past our way |journal=Critical Arts |volume=10 |issue=2 |pages=1–20 |year=1996 |pmid= |pmc=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Chinese folk religion}}
'''Nuo folk religion''', or extendedly '''Chinese popular exorcistic religion''', is a variant of [[Chinese folk religion]] with its own system of temples, rituals, orders of priests and gods, which is interethnic and practiced across central and southern [[China]] but is also intimately connected to the [[Tujia people]].{{sfnb|Li|2003}} It arose as an [[exorcism|exorcistic]] religious movement, which is the original meaning of ''nuó'' ({{zh|s=傩|t=[[wikt:儺|儺]]}}), and it spread even outside the boundaries of China exporting such practices in [[Japan]] and [[Korea]]. It has strong influences from [[Taoism]].{{sfnb|Li|2016|p=63}}

One of the most distinguishing characters of Nuo folk religion is its iconographic style, which represents the gods as wooden masks or heads. This is related to its own mythology, which traces the origin of Nuo to the two very first humans, who were unjustly killed by beheading and are since then worshipped as responsive divine ancestors.{{sfnb|Li|2016|pp=55-58}} Nuo rituals began as efficacious methods to worship them, Lord Nuo and Lady Nuo.{{sfnb|Li|2016|p=58}} Since the 1980s Nuo folk religion has undergone a revitalisation in China, and today is a folk religion endorsed by the central government.{{sfnb|Li|2010}} Nuo priests are classified as 巫 ''[[wu (shaman)|wu]]'' (shamans) and their historical precursors were the 方相氏 ''[[fangxiangshi]]'' ("masters who assist the [[circumpolar star|(astral) square]]").

==General theory==
===Cosmology===
Nuo cosmology is based on a [[yin and yang]] theory, clearly represented in mythology, otherwise explainable as a world in which potentiality and actuality, supernature and nature, form a complementary and dialectical duality which is the order of the universe. Man is an active participant within this order, interplaying with the world of divinity in a creative manner. Nuo mythology also tells of a highest goddess,''Tiānxiān'' (天仙 "Heavenly Immortal"), who is directly involved since the origin of humanity in triggering this dialogue between the spiritual and the material.{{sfnb|Li|2016|pp=57-58}} The primary form of dialogue is the worship of ancestors, and this is reflected in the patriarchal structure of Tujia society.{{sfnb|Li|2016|p=58}}

===Gods===
====Ancestral couple: Nuogong and Nuopo====
The highest deities in the Nuo pantheon are Lord Nuo (傩公 ''Nuógōng'') and Lady Nuo (''Nuópó'' 傩婆), the two ancestors of humanity, according to mythology, whose sacrifice gave origin to Nuo practices.{{sfnb|Li|2016|p=58}} When a Nuo ceremony is performed, the ancestral couple is represented by carved wooden statues erected in front of the temple, while all lesser gods are placed behind them. In simpler rituals, they are seen as embodiments of all the other gods.{{sfnb|Li|2016|p=58}}

====Three Purities and the Jade Deity====
Generally, right below the ancestral couple of Nuogong and Nuopo come the [[Three Pure Ones]] (三清 ''Sānqīng''). These are the main trinity of Taoist theology, and were introduced among the Tujia by [[Han Chinese]] who moved to their areas. Apart from the trinity and some elaborate ritual styles, Nuo folk religion has not acquired the philosophical contents of Taoism, as the purpose of Nuo practices is mainly to "nourish" Nuo gods.{{sfnb|Li|2016|pp=63-64}} Directly below the Three Pure Ones there is the [[Jade Emperor|Jade Deity]] (玉帝 ''Yùdì''), another deity from Taoist theology, who is invoked by Nuo priests by blowing into a peculiar ritual instrument, an ox horn. The Jade Deity is conceived as the commander of all lesser gods, so in order to communicate with them it is necessary to call upon him first.{{sfnb|Li|2016|pp=64-65}}

====Three Worlds' Deities, Five Directions' Deities and the Enthroned Deity====
Below the Jade Deity come the [[Deities of the Three Worlds]] (三皇 ''Sānhuáng'') and then the [[Deities of the Five Directions]] (五方帝 ''Wǔfāngdì''), both groups common to pre-Taoist Chinese religion. The triplet is formed by the patron of heaven (天皇 ''Tiānhuáng'', who is [[Fuxi]]), the patron of earth (地皇 ''Dehuáng'', who is [[Nuwa]]) and the patron of humanity (人皇 ''Rénhuáng'', who is [[Shennong]]).{{sfnb|Li|2016|p=65}}

The other group is formed by the [[Yellow Emperor|Yellow Deity]] of the centre of the cosmos, the Green or Blue Deity of the east, the Red Deity of the south, the White Deity of the east, and the Black Deity of the north. As in Chinese religion they have a cosmological significance corresponding to various aspects of nature and are believed to have been incarnated in historical personages.{{sfnb|Li|2016|p=65}}

Below the Three Patrons and the Five Deities there is the Enthroned Deity, who is considered to be incarnated in the present time. The most prominent contemporary government figure of China is believed to be the Enthroned God. In Nuo shrines there is often a tablet with the inscription "a long life to the god on the throne".{{sfnb|Li|2016|p=66}}

====Founders of priestly orders====
Every order of Nuo priests has its own founders, who are honoured at dedicated altars (师坛 ''shītán'', "order's altar"). The ancestors of the order are invoked during every ritual performance and in the divine hierarchy they come right below the Enthroned Deity. The three earliest Nuo ritualists common to nearly all the orders are Yan Sanlang, Liu Wulang and Huang Wanlang.{{sfnb|Li|2016|pp=66-67}}

There are also a [[Chinese gods and immortals|variety of gods of nature and of human affairs]], such as the Door Gods, the Well God, the Hearth God, the Land God and the Wealth God, which are those with an immediate relationship with people despite their lower rank in the Nuo pantheon.{{sfnb|Li|2016|p=67}}

==Temples and ceremonies==
The setting of Nuo activities are distinct temples (傩庙 ''nuómiào'', "exorcism's temple") and private altars (傩坛 ''nuótán'').{{sfnb|Li|2016|p=62}} The main task of Nuo practices is to strengthen the power of gods as much as possible so that they can exorcise malevolent beings.{{sfnb|Li|2016|p=64}}

Nuo ceremonies (傩仪 ''nuó yí'') can involve dance performance (傩舞 ''nuó wǔ''), songs (傩歌 ''nuó gē''), sacrifices (傩祭 ''nuó jì'') and the [[Nuo opera]] ({{lang|zh-hans|{{linktext|傩戏}}}} ''{{linktext|nuóxì}}'').

==Japanese Shinto rituals with Nuo origins==
[[File:Hososhi.jpg|thumb|150px|Japanese Shinto ceremonial ''hōsōshi'' at [[Heian Shrine]] (2010).]]
During the [[Heian period]] (794-1185), the [[Japan]]ese adopted into [[Shinto]] many [[Tang dynasty]] (618-907) Chinese customs, including the ''[[fangxiangshi]]'' (the precursor of Nuo priests) known in [[Japanese language|Japanese]] as ''hōsōshi'' 方相氏  who would lead a funeral procession and exorcise demons from a burial mound. This practice was merged with traditional Japanese exorcistic rites such as the Shinto ''[[ofuda]]'' ("talisman with the name of a ''[[kami]]''").

The earliest record was the (c. 797) ''[[Shoku Nihongi]]'' history,&lt;ref&gt;Gras, Alexandre (2004), "[https://www.lang.nagoya-u.ac.jp/nichigen/issue/pdf/5/5-03.pdf 追儺における呪文の名称と方相氏の役割の変化について]", ''Issues in Language and Culture'' 5: 35-53.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|45}} which mentions a ''hōsōshi'' exorcist officiating at the burial ceremonies for [[Emperor Shōmu]] (756), [[Emperor Kōnin]] (781), and [[Emperor Kanmu]] (806).

The [[Kyōgen]] actor Nomura Mannojō noted that Chinese ''nuo'' 儺 practices were the 8th-century source for the Japanese ''tsuina'' [[wikt:追儺|追儺]] or ''[[setsubun]]'' ("ritual to exorcise evil spirits on the last day of winter"), and proposed that supernatural power links the Chinese ''nuo'' performer ''fangxiangshi'' and the Japanese ''[[gigaku]]'' masked character ''Chidō'' 治道 ("govern the way") who leads a ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;Fukushima, Yoshiko (2005), "Masks, Interface of Past and Future: Nomura Mannojō's ''Shingigaku''", ''Asian Theatre Journal'' 22.2: 249-268.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|258}} In Japanese tradition and art, the ''hōsōshi'' wears a four-eyed mask rather than the original four-eyed bearskin.

The '''Orthodox Bahá'í Faith''' is a small [[Bahá'í divisions|Bahá'í sect]] that formed in 1960 by [[Mason Remey]], and subsequently was the name used by Joel Marangella after he claimed to be Remey's successor. The basis of the dispute is over the identity of the Guardian, a term referring to the appointed head of the religion, an executive hereditary office held by [[Shoghi Effendi]] from 1921 to 1957.

Other than on the matter of leadership and organization, there are few differences between the orthodox and mainstream Bahá'ís in matters of doctrine. As a group who believe that Mason Remey was the second Guardian of the Bahá'í Faith, they are considered heretical [[Covenant-breaker]]s by the majority of Bahá'ís who follow the leadership of the [[Universal House of Justice]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://bahai-library.com/uhj_mason_remey_followers Published by the Universal House of Justice]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Membership data of the Orthodox Bahá'ís is scarce. One source estimated them at no more than 100 members as of 1988.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.momen.org/relstud/covenant.htm THE COVENANT], [[Moojan Momen]]. Quoting ''Chicago Tribune'', 10 June 1988, section 1, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;  Memorandums from an Illinois court case in 2007 state their membership in the United States at 40.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120321004528/http://www.truebahai.info/court/49-1-reply-public.pdf], US District Court for Northern District Court of Illinois Eastern Division, Civil Action No. 64 C 1878: NSA’s Reply Memorandum to the Response of Franklin D. Schlatter, Joel B. Marangella and Provisional National Bahá'í Council, p8 para 2 line 5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120219232042/http://www.truebahai.info/court/54-1-surreply-brief.pdf], US District Court for Northern District Court of Illinois Eastern Division, Civil Action No. 64 C 1878: Orthodox Bahá'í Respondents' Surreply Memorandum to NSA's Reply Memorandum, p2 para 2 line 15&lt;/ref&gt; Websites claiming to represent the Orthodox community indicate followers in the United States and India. Joel Marangella died in San Diego, California on Sept 1, 2013.

==Background==
Following the unexpected death of the Bahá'í Faith's first Guardian [[Shoghi Effendi]] in 1957, the 27 living [[Hands of the Cause]], having the responsibility to acknowledge any appointment of a successor, gathered and decided that he had died "without having appointed his successor," and that the [[Universal House of Justice]] would decide on the situation after its first election.&lt;ref&gt;''Ministry of the Custodians'', [http://bahai-library.com/uhj_ministry_custodians#28 pp. 28-30]&lt;/ref&gt; Charles Mason Remey, one of the Hands, declared himself the successor to Shoghi Effendi in 1960.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.charlesmasonremey.net/1960_proclamation.htm Proclamation of Mason Remey] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120062722/http://www.charlesmasonremey.net/1960_proclamation.htm |date=2008-11-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His claim was rejected by the 26 remaining Hands, on the basis that he was not a descendant of Bahá'u'lláh, nor was he appointed to the position by Shoghi Effendi. Remey based his claim on his being the president of the [[International Bahá'í Council]] appointed by Shoghi Effendi in 1951. The result was that Remey was unanimously expelled from the Bahá'í community by the Hands of the Cause.

In 1962 Remey asked his supporters in the United States to organize themselves and elect a "National Spiritual Assembly Under the Hereditary Guardianship" (NSAUHG), first elected in 1963. The Assembly of 9 members was incorporated in New Mexico in 1964.&lt;ref name="OBF findings of fact"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120219232038/http://www.truebahai.info/court/87-obf-proposed-findings-of-fact-conclusions.pdf], US District Court for Northern District Court of Illinois Eastern Division, Civil Action No. 64 C 1878: Proposed Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law by Respondents Joel B. Marangella, Franklin D. Schlatter, and Provisional National Bahá'í Council.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1964 the NSAUHG filed a lawsuit against the National Spiritual Assembly (NSA) of the Bahá'ís of the United States to receive the legal title to the Bahá'í House of Worship in Illinois, and all other property owned by the NSA.&lt;ref name="1966 court"&gt;[http://bahai-library.com/bahais_vs_new-mexico_covenant-breakers Bahá'ís vs New Mexico Group] District Court, N.D. Illinois, E. Div. No. 64 C 1878. Decided June 28, 1966&lt;/ref&gt; The NSA counter-sued, and in August 1966 Remey instructed the NSAUHG to withdraw from any action in the matter "regardless of the consequences."&lt;ref name="OBF findings of fact" /&gt; Later that year, Remey asked the NSAUHG to dissolve, as well as the International Bahá'í Council that he had appointed with Joel Marangella as president, residing in France. Marangella previously served on the National Spiritual Assembly of France in 1961, and was declared a Covenant-breaker when he accepted Mason Remey as the next Guardian.

Over the years following 1966 the followers of Mason Remey were not organized; with some of his followers concluding that Remey was suffering from  [[dementia]]{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}, until several of the individuals involved began forming their own groups based on different understandings of succession.

In 1962 Remey gave Marangella a sealed envelope, with instructions to open it when the time was right. In 1965 Mason Remey called for the International Bahá'í Council, of which Marangella was president, to become active. Marangella then opened the sealed letter, which was a hand-written note by Remey appointing Marangella as his successor.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} Marangella looks upon that time as the time of his official appointment. Remey then changed his mind, deactivated the International Bahá'í Council in 1966, and in 1969 Marangella announced that he was the third Guardian. All of the members of the 1966 NSAUHG accepted Marangella's claim.&lt;ref name="OBF findings of fact" /&gt; 

In 1970 Marangella appointed members to a "National Bureau of the Orthodox Bahá'ís in New York", which two years later was moved to New Mexico, and subsequently changed its name to "Mother Bahá'í Council of the United States" (1978) and "Provisional National Bahá'í Council" (2000), with all members appointed by Joel Marangella..&lt;ref name="OBF findings of fact" /&gt; Marangella died in San Diego, CA on Sept 1, 2013.

The third Guardian of the Baha'i Faith Joel Bray Marangella in his Proclamation of 22 September 2006  appointed a Persian Nosrat'u'llah Bahremand the eldest son of Hassan Bahremand, a prominent member of the Orthodox Baha'i Faith as the Fourth Guardian of Orthodox Baha'i Faith. &lt;ref name="Nosrat'u'llah Bahremand"&gt;[http://www.orthodoxbahai.de/46.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

His other attributes were [[fire]], [[mountains]], [[wind]], the [[oak]], [[iris (plant)|iris]], [[eagle]], [[firmament]] (in [[Indo-European languages]], this was joined with the notion of the ''sky of stone''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = Indo-European and the Indo-Europeans: A Reconstruction and Historical Analysis of a Proto-Language and a Proto-Cuture|last = Gamkrelidze|first = Thomas V.|publisher = Mouton de Gruyter|year = 1995|isbn = 3-11-009646-3|location = Berlin, New York|pages = 575|last2 = Ivanov|first2 = Vjaceslav V.}}&lt;/ref&gt;), [[horse]]s and [[cart]]s, [[weapon]]s ([[hammer]], [[axe]] ([[Axe of Perun]]), and [[arrow (weapon)|arrow]]), and [[war]]. He was first associated with weapons made of [[Rock (geology)|stone]] and later with those of [[metal]].

== Sources ==
Of all historic records describing Slavic gods, those mentioning Perun are the most numerous.  As early as the 6th century, he was mentioned in [[De Bello Gothico]], a historical source written by the [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern Roman]] historian [[Procopius]]. A short note describing beliefs of a certain South Slavic tribe states they ''acknowledge that one god, creator of lightning, is the only lord of all: to him do they sacrifice an ox and all sacrificial animals.''  While the name of the god is not mentioned here explicitly, 20th century research has established beyond doubt that the god of thunder and lightning in Slavic mythology is Perun.&lt;ref name=katicic2008&gt;{{cite book |last=Katičić |first=Radoslav |title=Božanski boj: Tragovima svetih pjesama naše pretkršćanske starine |year=2008 |publisher=IBIS GRAFIKA |location=Zagreb |isbn=978-953-6927-41-8 |url=http://ir.nmu.org.ua/bitstream/handle/123456789/120570/96db5654f2d3025b46454ace91716506.pdf |ref=Katičić 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151018000746/http://ir.nmu.org.ua/bitstream/handle/123456789/120570/96db5654f2d3025b46454ace91716506.pdf |archivedate=2015-10-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; To this day the word ''perun'' in a number of Slavic languages means "thunder," or "lightning bolt".

The [[Primary Chronicle]] relates that in the year 6415 (907 AD) prince [[Oleg of Novgorod|Oleg]] (Scandin.: Olaf) made a peace treaty with the Byzantine Empire and by taking his men to the shrines and swearing by their weapons and by their god Perun, and by [[Veles (god)|Volos]], the god of cattle, they confirmed the treaty. We find the same form of confirmation of a peace treaty by prince [[Igor Svyatoslavich|Igor]] in 945. In 980, when prince [[Vladimir the Great]] came to the throne of [[Kiev]], he erected statues of five pagan gods in front of his palace which he soon thereafter discarded after his Christianization in 988. Perun was chief among these, represented with a silver head and a golden moustache.&lt;ref name=katicic2008/&gt;{{Rp|page=133-}} Vladimir's uncle Dobrinja also had a shrine of Perun established in his city of [[Novgorod]]. After the Christianization of [[Kievan Rus]], this place became a monastery, which, quite remarkably, continued to bear the name of Perun.

[[File:Thundermarks.svg|right|thumb|270px|''Gromoviti znaci'' or thunder marks are considered by some scholars as "ancient symbols of Perun", which are often engraved upon roof beams or over entries of village houses, to protect them from lightning bolts. Their circular shape symbolises [[ball lightning]]. Identical symbols were discovered on [[Early Slavs|Slavic]] pottery of 4th century [[Chernyakhov culture]].&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia of Ukraine'', vol. 3 (''1993'')&lt;/ref&gt;]]

[[File:Axe Perun.jpg|right|thumb|270px|Drawings of Slavic axe amulets based on archaeological findings dating between the 11th and 12th century.]]

Perun is not mentioned directly in any of the records of Western Slavic traditional religion, but a reference to him is perhaps made in a short note in [[Helmold]]'s [[Chronica Slavorum]], written in the latter half of the 12th century, which states (quite similarly to Procopius some six centuries earlier) that Slavic tribes, even though they worship many various gods, all agree there is a supreme god in heaven which rules over all other on earth.  This could be a reference to Perun, but since he is not named, nor any of his chief attributes (thunder or lightning) mentioned, we cannot be certain.

Moreover, the name of Perun is also commonly found in Southern Slavic toponymy. The [[Bulgaria]]n and [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonian]] people believe that the name of the Bulgarian mountain [[Pirin]], one of the highest mountains of the Balkan Peninsula, was named after Perun. There are also places called: Perun (the famous mountain in [[Bosnia Herzegovina]], [[Vareš]]), Perunac, Perunovac, Perunika, Perunička Glava, Peruni Vrh, Perunja Ves, Peruna Dubrava, Perunuša, Perušice, Perudina and Perutovac. The word "Pero" means feather and the names of mountains and cities could refer to poultry. 
These names today mostly represent mountain tops, but in medieval times, large oaks, sacred groves and even entire villages or citadels were named Perun. Among South Slavs, a mountain plant ''[[Iris germanica]]'' is known in folklore as ''perunika'' ("Perun's plant") and sometimes also as ''bogisha'', ("god's plant"), and was believed to grow from ground that had been struck by lightning. Also the Serbian surname Peruničić and the Macedonian Перуновски (Perunovski) are derived from Perun.

The [[Bulgaria]]n people believe that the name of city [[Pernik]] is thought to have originated from that of Slavic god Perun with the Slavic placename suffix –nik (or –ik) added, and was first mentioned in the 9th century. The medieval town was a key Bulgarian stronghold during Bulgarian tsar Samuil's wars against the Byzantine Empire in the 11th century, when it was governed by the local noble [[Krakra of Pernik]], withstanding Byzantine sieges a number of times.

Some places in Central Europe possibly named after Perun are the villages of [[Parndorf]] (formerly known as Perun) and [[Pernitz]] in the [[Parndorf Plain]], [[Perná]] in [[Moravia]], [[Beroun]] in [[Bohemia]], and [[Pernek]] in [[Slovakia]].
&lt;!-- Missing image removed: [[File:Klimenko perun.jpg|thumb|right|275px|''Perun by Andrei Klimenko'']] --&gt;

== Etymology ==
{{Main|Perkwunos}}
Perun is strongly correlated with the near-identical ''[[Perkūnas]]''/''Pērkons'' from [[Baltic mythology]], suggesting either a common derivative of the [[Proto-Indo-European religion|Proto-Indo European]] thunder god (whose original name has been reconstructed as [[Perkwunos]]), or that one of these cultures borrowed the deity from the other. The root ''*perkwu'' originally probably meant ''oak'', but in [[Proto-Slavic]] this evolved into ''per-'' meaning "to strike, to slay".
The Lithuanian word "Perkūnas" has two meanings: "thunder" and the name of the god of thunder and lightning.

Artifacts, traditions and toponyms show the presence of the cult of Perun among all [[Slavs|Slavic]], [[Balts|Baltic]] and [[Finno-Ugric languages|Ugro-Finnic]] peoples. Perun was also related to an archaic form of [[astronomy]] – the [[Pole star]] was called Perun's eye and countless Slavic and Hungarian astronomers continued this tradition – most known ones are [[Nicolaus Copernicus]], and [[Franz Xaver von Zach]].

== Myth ==
In Slavic mythology, much like in Norse and Baltic mythologies, the world was represented by a [[Slavic mythology#Cosmology|sacred tree]], usually an oak, whose branches and trunk represented the living world of heavens and mortals, whilst its roots represented the underworld, i.e. the realm of the dead.  Perun was the ruler of the living world, sky and earth, and was often symbolised by an eagle sitting on the top of the tallest branch of the sacred tree, from which he kept watch over the entire world.  Deep down in the roots of the tree was the place of his opponent, symbolised by a serpent or a dragon: this was [[Veles (god)|Veles]], watery god of the underworld, who continually provoked Perun by creeping up from the wet below up into the high and dry domain of Perun, stealing his cattle, children, or wife.  Perun pursued Veles around the earth, attacking him with his lightning bolts from the sky.  Veles fled from him by transforming himself into various animals, or hiding behind trees, houses, or people; wherever a lightning bolt struck, it was believed that this was because Veles hid from Perun under or behind that particular place.  In the end, Perun managed to kill Veles, or to chase him back down into his watery underworld.  The supreme god thus reestablished order in the world, which had been disrupted by his chaotic enemy.  He then returned to the top of the World tree and proudly informed his opponent down in the roots ''"Well, there is your place, remain there!"'' (Ну, там твое место, там сабе будь!).  This line came from a [[Belarusians|Belarusian]] folk tale.  To the Slavs, the mythological symbolism of a supreme heavenly god who battles with his underworldly enemy through storms and thunder was extremely significant, and from Perun and Veles, this idea of cosmic battle was passed onto [[God]] and the [[Devil]] following Christianization.

While the exact pantheon characterization differed between the various Slavic tribes, Perun is generally believed to have been considered as the supreme god by the majority, or perhaps by nearly all Slavs, at least towards the end of Slavic paganism. The earliest supreme god was probably [[Rod (god)|Rod]]; it is unclear precisely how and why his worship as the head of the pantheon evolved into the worship of Perun. Another candidate for supreme deity among at least some Slavs is [[Svarog]].

== Weapons ==
In the [[Trifunctional hypothesis|classification scheme]] of [[Georges Dumézil]], Perun was the god of the second function (physical and military power), a [[List of war deities|god of war]], and as such, he was armed with several fantastic weapons.  Perun's lightning bolts were believed to be [[Rock (geology)|stones]] and stone [[arrow (weapon)|arrows]].  According to folk beliefs, [[fulgurite]]s, [[belemnite]]s, and sometimes even the remains of prehistoric stone [[tool]]s found in the ground are remains of these weapons.  Various Slavic countries also call these deposits "Perun's stones", "thunderbolt stones", "thunderbolt wedges" and "Perun's arrow"; other unrelated names for these include "devil's finger", "God's finger", and "Mother of God finger", and in [[Lithuania]], "Perkun's finger" ([[Belemnitida]]).{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}  These thunderbolt stones were sometimes said to be transferred back to the sky by the [[wind]] after being under earth for a period of seven years.  The weapons of Perun protected against bad [[luck]], evil [[magic (paranormal)|magic]], [[disease]], and – naturally enough – lightning itself.

Perun also had another type of weapon in his arsenal, as destructive as his firestone arrows, but even more unusual: mythical golden apples. While this may not seem to be much of a weapon, in many{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} Slavic folk accounts, the [[golden apple]] appears as a [[Amulet|talisman]] of ultimate destruction. An example from a Serbian folk song from Montenegro with strong mythical elements relates:

''…Те извади три јабуке златне'' &lt;br /&gt;
''И баци их небу у висине...'' &lt;br /&gt;
''…Три муње од неба пукоше'' &lt;br /&gt;
''Једна гађа два дјевера млада,'' &lt;br /&gt;
''Друга гађа пашу на дорину,'' &lt;br /&gt;
''Трећа гађа свата шест стотина,'' &lt;br /&gt;
''Не утече ока за свједока,'' &lt;br /&gt;
''Ни да каже, како погибоше.''

"…He grabbed three golden apples &lt;br /&gt;
And threw them high into the sky... &lt;br /&gt;
…Three lightning bolts burst from the sky, &lt;br /&gt;
The first struck at two young grooms, &lt;br /&gt;
The second struck a horse in a stall, &lt;br /&gt;
The third struck six hundred wedding guests, &lt;br /&gt;
Not an eyewitness left &lt;br /&gt;
Not even to say how they died."

It is conjectured{{by whom|date=January 2014}} that the mythical golden apples of Perun were symbols of a rare but notorious form of atmospheric discharge, [[ball lightning]]. The same is probably true{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} for the thunder marks of East Slavic folklore, of which two examples are shown above.

== Characteristics ==

{{See also|Peryn#The heathen shrine}}

Remains of an ancient shrine to Perun discovered in [[Peryn]] consisted of a wide circular platform centred around a statue, encircled by a trench with eight [[apse]]s, which contained sacrificial altars and possibly additional statues. The overall plan of the shrine shows clear symbolism of the number nine.  This is sometimes interpreted that Perun, in fact, had nine sons (or eight sons, with himself, the father, being the ninth Perun).  It should also be noted that in some Slavic folk songs, nine unnamed brothers are mentioned.

Similarly to [[Perkūnas]] of [[Baltic mythology]], Perun was considered to have multiple aspects. In one [[Lithuania]]n song, it is said there are in fact nine versions of Perkūnas. From comparison to the Baltic mythology, and also from additional sources in Slavic folklore, it can also be shown that Perun was married to the Sun.  He, however, shared his wife with his enemy Veles, as each night the Sun was thought of as diving behind the horizon and into the underworld, the realm of the dead over which Veles ruled.

Like many other Indo-European thunder gods, Perun's vegetative [[Hypostasis (linguistics)|hypostasis]] was the [[oak]], especially a particularly distinctive or prominent one.  In Southern Slavic traditions, marked oaks stood on country borders; communities at these positions were visited during village [[religious holiday|holidays]] in the late spring and during the summer.  Shrines of Perun were located either on top of mountains or hills, or in sacred groves underneath ancient oaks.  These were a general place of worship and holding of sacrifices (with a [[bull]], an [[ox]], a [[ram (sheep)|ram]], and [[Egg (food)|eggs]]).

In addition to the tree association, Perun had a day association (Thursday) as well as the material association (tin).&lt;ref&gt;[http://paganism.msk.ru/gods/gods31.htm "Язычество славян" – Боги славян&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-Christian Perun ==

With the arrival of Christianity, the old gods fared poorly  amongst the Slavs.  Grand prince [[Vladimir the Great]], who had once been a very vocal and lavish patron of Perun, converted to [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christianity]].  In 998 he, his family and the people of the [[Kievan Rus']] were collectively baptized.  He ordered that the statues of Perun which he himself had erected formerly, be dethroned, torn down in with great dishonor and dragged through the streets as they were beaten with sticks.  The idols were then cast into rivers and not permitted to land on the shore.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fatheralexander.org/booklets/english/saints/vladimir_prince.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  Three of Vladimir's sons are also recognized as saints.  Modern scholarship on the [[syncretism]] (or dvoeverie) of the Christian and pagan gods seems to be more of an academic construct.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.worldhistory.biz/modern-history/83028-chapter-5-belief.html&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18469">'''Political theology in China''' includes responses from Chinese government leaders, scholars, and religious leaders who deal with the relationship between religion and politics. For two millennia, this was organized based on a Confucian understanding of religion and politics, often discussed in terms of Confucian political philosophy.{{sfn|Wong|2011}} At various points throughout its history, Chinese Buddhism presented an alternative to the political import of Confucianism. However, since the mid-twentieth century, [[Communist Party of China|communist]] understandings of religion have dominated the discourse.

For Christianity, this relationship can be seen from the religion's earliest encounters in the country during the imperial period, with the [[Church of the East in China|Church of the East]]'s interaction with the [[Emperor Taizong of Tang|Emperor Taizong]] and [[Jesuit missions to China|Jesuit missionaries]] in the Ming court. But it has developed the most in the 20th and 21st centuries after the establishments of the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]] and [[People's Republic of China]]. This is particularly true through the establishment of the Protestant [[Three-Self Patriotic Movement]] and the [[Chinese Catholic Patriotic Association]], the rise of [[underground church|underground]] and [[House church (China)|house church]]es, and interactions with the secular academy.

== Imperial China ==
[[File:Nestorians-1-.jpg|thumb|The [[Nestorian Stele]], erected in 781, recording interactions between the [[Church of the East in China|Church of the East]] and [[Emperor Taizong of Tang|Emperor Taizong]]]]
For over two millennia, from the [[Han dynasty]] (206&amp;nbsp;BC&amp;nbsp;– AD&amp;nbsp;220) until the [[Qing dynasty]] (1636–1912), the dominant ideology that was upheld as state orthodoxy was [[Confucianism]]. During much of this time, all other religions needed to be registered and administered under the Confucian political system.{{sfn|Bays|2004}} This would shape the history of the relationship between Christianity and politics in China could be traced to [[Tang dynasty|Tang Dynasty]] (618–907), when scholars believe that Christianity first came to China.{{sfn|Bays|2012|pp=4–16}} [[Emperor Taizong of Tang|Emperor Taizong]] and his successors of adopted the policy of religious tolerance. They allowed the mission of [[Church of the East in China|Church of the East]] monks and invited them to translate scriptures for the empire. In 845, during the [[Great Anti-Buddhist Persecution]], the Church of the East was misunderstood as a sect of Buddhism and was banned by [[Emperor Wuzong of Tang|Emperor Wuzong]]. In [[Yuan dynasty|Yuan Dynasty]] (1271–1368), several Mongol tribes converted to Christianity through the Church of the East. During this time, the Pope of the Roman Catholic Church also sent envoys to the Mongol Empire capital [[Khanbaliq]] (present-day Beijing).

In [[Ming dynasty|Ming Dynasty]] (1368–1644), [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]] initiated mission in China. [[Matteo Ricci]] would be the most well-known among these missionaries. Jesuits exerted considerable influence at court via the policy of accommodation and converted several senior officials, such as [[Xu Guangqi]]. In [[Qing dynasty]] (1636–1912), Catholic missionaries still played important roles at court as consultants of emperors. In the 18th century, the [[Chinese Rites controversy]] had raised tension between the Vatican and Qing dynasty's Emperors. [[Yongzheng Emperor|Emperor Yongzheng]] was formally against Christian converts among Manchu people and banned the mission again.

After the [[First Opium War]] (1839–1842), with the aid of several unequal treaties, Christian missionaries were allowed to evangelize in China and continue to import the Western civilization to China. Due to an impression that missionaries were allies with foreign colonial governments, many Chinese became hostile to Christianity. This further influenced the relationship between Christianity and politics. Many [[Anti-missionary riots in China|anti-missionary riots]] (''Jiao'an''), the [[Boxer Rebellion]], and the [[Anti-Christian Movement (China)|anti-Christian movement]] can be considered as the consequences of such relationship.

== Republic of China ==
{{Expand section|date=December 2017}}
The 20th century witnessed the emergence of new Chinese political thinkers. The [[May Fourth movement]] emphasized a climate of strong political engagement, under the mantra of "Mr. Science" and "Mr. Democracy," and the growing ferment around the national salvation movement.

[[Kang Youwei]] advocated the idea of a [[Confucian church]] as the [[state religion]] of China.{{sfn|Goossaert|2011|pp=45-47, 95}} [[Taixu]] would seek to reform [[Chinese Buddhism]], to contribute to the building of Chinese society and politics.{{sfn|Goossaert|2011|pp=80-82}} Christian leaders like [[Y. T. Wu|Y.&amp;nbsp;T. Wu]], in the face of the [[Anti-Christian Movement (China)|anti-Christian movement]], appealed to revolutionary theory and constructed a Chinese Christian theology.{{sfn|Kwok|2016}}

==People's Republic of China ==

=== Protestantism ===
After 1949, the founding of the [[China|People's Republic of China]], the Chinese Protestant leaders encountered new challenges&amp;nbsp;– the new regime of the communist government is based on atheistic ideology of Marxism. They had to decide how to deal with the relationship with the atheistic government. There were different attitudes and theologies among Chinese Christians. Some of them, such as Y.&amp;nbsp;T. Wu, who were willing to support the new government, helped to pen the [[Three-Self Patriotic Movement#Christian Manifesto|Christian Manifesto]] and initiated the [[Three-Self Movement|Three-Self movement]] (TSPM) in 1950s; they reconstructed theology in terms of cooperation. Others, such as [[Wang Ming-Dao|Wang Mingdao]], were unwilling to endorse the radical TSPM and refused to support the new government, are regarded as the forerunners of the present-day [[House church (China)|house church]].{{sfn|Brook|1996|p=334}}

In the 1950s Denunciation Campaigns, some Christian leaders, such as Wang Mingdao, [[Watchman Nee]], from the opposing camp were arrested and sentenced in the name of counter-revolutionaries. During the ten years of [[Cultural Revolution]] (1966–1976), all the religious activities were banned and many Christians met and worshiped in the Christians' houses.

In 1980s, religious activities recovered and churches gradually opened. However, Christians who were unwilling to joined the TSPM churches and chose to gather in unregistered [[House church (China)|house church]]es which gather in personal houses or apartments.{{sfn|Liu|Wang|2012|pp=37–45}} [[K. H. Ting]] and [[Wang Weifan]] were leaders and representatives of the TSPM church. [[Wang Ming-Dao|Wang Mingdao]] and [[Wang Yi (pastor)|Wang Yi]] would be representatives of the house church; the latter Wang is the pastor in the urban church in Chengdu which is not a traditional house church, but who still claims the link to the house church.{{sfn|Chow|2014}}

=== Catholicism ===
In the 1950s, after [[Zhou Enlai]] saw the possibilities in Protestantism with the TSPM, a similar approach was taken with Catholicism leading to the formation in 1957 of the [[Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association]] (CPCA), severing ties with the Vatican. Those who chose not to affiliate with the CPCA and remain loyal to the Pope and the Vatican are often considered part of the [[underground church]].{{sfn|Bays|2012|pp=192–193}}

[[Ignatius Kung Pin-Mei]], the Catholic bishop of Shanghai, opposed the formation of the CPCA and, along with several hundred bishops and church leaders, was arrested on 8 September 1955.{{sfn|Mariani|2011|pp=148–151}} He viewed the CPCA as being schismatic and, therefore, not in union with the universal [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Kung Pin-Mei |first=Ignatius |author-link=Ignatius Kung Pin-Mei |year=1988 |title=A Call to Fidelity to the Church |url=http://www.cardinalkungfoundation.org/ck/CKacalltofidelity.php |location=Stamford, Connecticut |publisher=Cardinal Kung Foundation |access-date=24 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kung criticized China's lack of religious freedom and reckoned that Chinese Catholics "do not have the freedom to worship."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Kung Pin-Mei |first=Ignatius |author-link=Ignatius Kung Pin-Mei |year=1991 |title=Speech of Ignatius Cardinal Kung on the Occasion of Receiving the Proclamation and the Key to the City of Stamford from Mayor Thomas Serrani, Mayor of Stamford, Connecticut |url=http://www.cardinalkungfoundation.org/ck/CKspeech.php |location=Stamford, Connecticut |publisher=Cardinal Kung Foundation |access-date=24 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; When he was interviewed by the ''Soul Magazine'' in 1993, [[Ignatius Kung Pin-Mei|Kung]] expressed his sympathy for the underground Catholics and Bishops under the Communist government and claimed that, "The government should understand from history that every time the Church was persecuted, the Church has always survived and grown out of the persecution."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Kung Pin-Mei |first=Ignatius |author-link=Ignatius Kung Pin-Mei |date=July 1993 |title=An Interview with Cardinal Ignatius Kung of Shanghai |url=http://www.cardinalkungfoundation.org/ck/CKinterview.php |magazine=Soul Magazine |pages=18–21 |access-date=24 February 2018 |via=Cardinal Kung Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another significant figure was [[Aloysius Jin Luxian]], who was arrested alongside Kung on 8 September 1955. However, after being released from prison in 1982, he took several leadership roles within the CPCA, including becoming founding rector of the Sheshan Seminary and bishop of Shanghai in 1988, without Vatican approval.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Clark |first=Anthony E. |date=30 April 2013 |title=The Death of China's Most Famous &amp; Powerful Bishop |url=http://www.catholicworldreport.com/2013/04/30/the-death-of-chinas-most-famous-powerful-bishop/ |work=Catholic World Report |access-date=8 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Confucianism ===
{{Expand section|date=December 2017}}
Despite the [[Criticize Lin, Criticize Confucius|Anti-Confucius]] developments of the Cultural Revolution, since the 1980s, there has been a restored interest in Confucianism as offering a renewed political ideology for mainland China. Part of this has included the introduction of [[New Confucianism]] from Taiwan and North America. Some have advocated for the building of new [[Confucian church]]es in the country.{{sfn|Billioud|Thoraval|2015|p=201}} Others, such as [[Jiang Qing (Confucian)|Jiang Qing]] have advocated for a new form of constitutional Confucianism.{{sfn|Jiang|2012}}

=== Academy ===
Since the late 1980s there has been a growing interest in Christianity among academics in China's secular universities. Often described as [[Cultural Christian#China|Cultural Christians]], many of whom are not self-identified Christians, these scholars have been drawn to Christianity as a source for the modernization of China. One of the key figures of this movement, [[Liu Xiaofeng (academic)|Liu Xiaofeng]] at [[Renmin University of China]], in the 2000s began to draw on the [[political theology]] of [[Carl Schmitt]] for engaging the Chinese political arena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Sapio |first=Flora |date=7 October 2015 |title=Carl Schmitt in China |url=https://www.thechinastory.org/2015/10/carl-schmitt-in-china/ |website=The China Story |location=Canberra |publisher=Australian National University |access-date=15 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others, such as Xie Zhibin from [[Tongji University]] in Shanghai, has attempted to offer a [[public theology|public theological]] engagement based on the theology of [[Max Lynn Stackhouse|Max Stackhouse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Zhibin Xie |url=http://www.ctinquiry.org/program/bio_zhibin-xie |location=Princeton, New Jersey |publisher=Center of Theological Inquiry |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171215221225/https://www.ctinquiry.org/program/bio_zhibin-xie |archive-date=15 December 2017 |access-date=15 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Zhibin Xie |date=30 June 2015 |title=Zhibin Xie Interview |url=https://blog.ctinquiry.org/2015/06/30/zhibin-xie-interview/ |dead-url=no |interviewer-last=Mauldin |interviewer-first=Josh |work=Fresh Thinking |location=Princeton, New Jersey |publisher=Center of Theological Inquiry |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171215221307/https://blog.ctinquiry.org/2015/06/30/zhibin-xie-interview/ |archive-date=15 December 2017 |access-date=15 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most recently, Zhuo Xinping of the [[Chinese Academy of Social Sciences]] has advocated for the sinicization or Chinization ({{zh|s=中国化|p=Zhongguo hua}}) of Christianity both politically and culturally.{{sfn|Zhuo|2014}}

== Key documents ==

=== The Christian Manifesto ===
"[[The Christian Manifesto]]" was published in July 1950 and its original title was "Direction of Endeavor for Chinese Christianity in the Construction of New China." The founding group of the Three-Self Patriotic Movement, including Y.&amp;nbsp;T. Wu, drafted the document in consultation with Premier [[Zhou Enlai]]. During the 1950s, 400,000 Protestant Christians publicly endorsed and signed this document.{{sfn|Merwin|Jones|1963|pp=19–20}}

=== The 95 Theses of the Chinese Reformed Church ===
In August 2015 Wang Yi posted a document titled "Reaffirming Our Stance on the House Churches: 95 Theses" in an attempt to reaffirm the Chinese house church's position in the relationship between government and society. Echoing [[Martin Luther]]'s [[95 theses]], these Chinese 95 theses demonstrate his opinion of the church-state relationship from the perspective of the house church.{{sfn|Starr|2016}}

'''Pseudo-Bonaventure''' ({{lang-la|Pseudo-Bonaventura}}) is the name given to the authors of a number of medieval devotional works which were believed at the time to be the work of [[Bonaventure]]: "It would almost seem as if 'Bonaventura' came to be regarded as a convenient label for a certain type of text, rather than an assertion of authorship".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=5LyCLsJNdV4C&amp;pg=PA128&amp;lpg=PA128&amp;dq=%22Pseudo+Bonaventura%22&amp;source=web&amp;ots=wHhVCfrqCd&amp;sig=Up0u3oZvfPLZwILNKQ0nF_sJRtA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ct=result Medieval texts and their first appearance in print, E. P. Goldschmidt, p. 128]&lt;/ref&gt; Since it is clear a number of actual authors are involved, the term "Pseudo-Bonaventuran" is often used.  Many works now have other attributions of authorship which are generally accepted, but the most famous, the ''[[Meditations on the Life of Christ]]'', remains usually described only as a work of  Pseudo-Bonaventure.

==Other works==
*"[[Biblia pauperum]]" ("Poor Man's Bible" – a title only given in the 20th century) a short [[typology (theology)|typological]] version of the Bible, also extremely popular, and often illustrated. There were different versions of this, the original perhaps by the [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] [[Nicholas of Hanapis]]. 
*''Speculum Beatæ Mariæ Virginis'' by [[Conrad of Saxony]]
*''Speculum Disciplinæ'', ''Epistola ad Quendam Novitium'' and ''Centiloquium'', all probably by Bonanventura's secretary, [[Bernard of Besse]]

The '''Society of Saint Pius X''' ({{lang-la|Fraternitas Sacerdotalis Sancti Pii X}};  also known as the '''SSPX''' or the '''FSSPX''') is an international priestly fraternity founded in 1970 by [[Marcel Lefebvre]], the [[France|French]] [[titular bishop|titular archbishop]] of the Roman Catholic diocese of [[Synnada in Phrygia]].

The Society is known for rejecting many of the ecclesiastical reforms both influenced or institutionalized by the [[Second Vatican Council]], and maintaining the [[Tridentine Mass]] among its followers. The present [[superior general]] of the Society is Father Davide Pagliarani, succeeding Bishop [[Bernard Fellay]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=New Superior of the SSPX - Father Davide Pagliarini |url=https://gloria.tv/article/9bq9FBq6x8uL6NNc76641ve68 |publisher=Gloria.tv |date=July 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tensions between the society and the [[Holy See]] reached their height in 1988, when Archbishop Lefebvre consecrated four bishops without the Apostolic Mandate and against a personal warning by [[Pope John Paul II]], known as the "[[Écône consecrations]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1988/06/16/Vatican-threatens-dissident-priest-with-excommunication/3546882320320/|title=Vatican threatens dissident priest with excommunication|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in Rome issuing a declaration of excommunication against the bishops who consecrated or were consecrated.&lt;ref name="ewtn"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ewtn.com/library/CURIA/CBISLEFB.HTM|title=Office of Congregation for Bishops - Excommunication|publisher=|accessdate=21 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the priestly fraternity denied that the bishops incurred any penalty, claiming canon law in their defense, the declared excommunication of the surviving bishops was at their request removed in January 2009 with a hope expressed that all members of the society would quickly return to [[full communion]].&lt;ref name="catholicnewsagency"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/new.php?n=14881|title=Pope Benedict lifts excommunication of bishops ordained by Lefebvre|agency=Catholic News Agency|accessdate=21 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, the Society has seen a growing recognition of its sacramental and pastoral activities by the [[Holy See]].  The Holy See extended, on 20 November 2016, permanent canonical recognition to confessions heard by Society priests (''Misericordia et Misera, 12'')&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://w2.vatican.va/content/francesco/en/apost_letters/documents/papa-francesco-lettera-ap_20161120_misericordia-et-misera.html|title=Apostolic Letter Misericordia et misera (20 November 2016) {{!}} Francis|website=w2.vatican.va|access-date=2017-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later, on 4 April 2017, also allowed local ordinaries to grant delegation to priests of the Society for officially witnessing marriages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://press.vatican.va/content/salastampa/en/bollettino/pubblico/2017/04/04/170404d.html|title=Letter of the Pontifical Commission “Ecclesia Dei” to the Ordinaries of the Episcopal Conferences concerned on the faculties for the celebration of marriages of the faithful of the Society Saint Pius X, 04.04.2017|access-date=2018-09-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The significance of these recognitions is that, unique among the sacraments of the Catholic Church, both confession and marriage require canonical jurisdiction for their validity (it was a long-standing contention by the Society's critics that confessions could not be heard or marriages witnessed by a Society priest, due to defect-of-form).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.catholicculture.org/commentary/otc.cfm?id=1080&amp;repos=6&amp;subrepos=2&amp;searchid=1707557|title=Warning: An SSPX Priest Is Incapable of Absolving You from Sin|website=www.catholicculture.org|access-date=2017-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the Vatican named Bishop Fellay judge in a canonical trial against one of the Society's priests.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.catholicculture.org/news/headlines/index.cfm?storyid=25155&amp;repos=4&amp;subrepos=2&amp;searchid=1707558|title=Vatican names Bishop Fellay to hear canonical charge against SSPX priest, despite bishop's suspension : News Headlines|website=www.catholicculture.org|access-date=2017-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of the SSPX==
[[File:Marcel Lefebvre 1981.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Lefebvre, the society's founder, celebrating Tridentine Mass]]
Like the [[Traditionalist Catholicism]] in general, the SSPX was born out of opposition to changes in the Catholic Church that followed the [[Second Vatican Council]] (1962–1965). The founder and central figure of the society was the [[French people|French]] [[Archbishop]] [[Marcel Lefebvre]], who had served the Catholic Church as [[Apostolic Delegate]] for French-speaking Africa, [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Dakar|Archbishop of Dakar]], and Superior General of the [[Congregation of the Holy Spirit]], a missionary order of priests.

=== Foundation of the Society ===
In May 1970, shortly after his retirement as Superior General of the Congregation of the Holy Spirit, Lefebvre was approached by eleven members of the [[Pontifical French Seminary]] in [[Rome]] who had been criticized for their adherence to the traditional doctrines of the Catholic Church. They sought Lefebvre's advice on a conservative seminary where they could complete their studies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://la.revue.item.free.fr/interview_aulagnier_wanderer_anglais.htm The Wanderer Interviews Fr. Aulagnier, SSPX], Luc Gagnon, September 18, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; He directed them to the still conservative [[University of Fribourg]], in [[Switzerland]]. However, soon the University had become as liberal as anywhere else.

In late 1970, at age 65, urged by the [[abbot]] of [[Hauterive Abbey]] and the [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] theologian Father Marie-Dominique Philippe to teach the seminarians personally, Lefebvre, feeling too old to undertake such a large project, told them he would visit François Charrière, Bishop of [[Lausanne]], [[Geneva]] and [[Fribourg]], with a request to set up a religious society. He told them, if he said to go through with it, he would see in it a sign of [[divine providence]]. Charrière granted Lefebvre's request and, with a document predated by six days to 1 November 1970, he established the Society of St. Pius X as a ''pia unio'' (Latin, for "pious, or holy, union") on a provisional (''ad experimentum'') basis for six years. ''Pia unio'' status was the first stage through which a Catholic organisation passed prior to gaining official recognition as a [[religious institute]] or [[society of apostolic life]]. (Since 1983, the term "association of the faithful" has replaced "''pia unio''".) The Society of Saint Pius X was formally founded, adhering to all canonical norms, and receiving the episcopal blessing and encouragement of the local ordinary. Some Swiss laymen offered the [[International Seminary of Saint Pius X]] at [[Écône]] to the newly-formed group, and in 1971 the first 24 candidates entered, followed by a further 32 in October 1972.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.holycrossseminary.com/Most_Asked_Questions_Appendix_III_page2.htm|title=Short History Of The Society Of Saint Pius X|publisher=|accessdate=21 August 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924031048/http://www.holycrossseminary.com/Most_Asked_Questions_Appendix_III_page2.htm|archivedate=24 September 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Normally, after a suitable period of experience and consultation with the [[Holy See]], a bishop would raise a ''pia unio'' to official status at diocesan level. Lefebvre attempted to bypass this stage, and contacted three different Vatican departments in order to secure early recognition for his society. He succeeded in obtaining a letter of encouragement from [[John Wright (cardinal)|Cardinal John Wright]], [[prefect]] of the [[Congregation for the Clergy]], but there was no approval from the Vatican congregation responsible for raising an association to the level desired by Lefebvre. Cardinal Wright's letter, dated 18 February 1971, said with regard to the field of competence of Cardinal Wright's own Congregation, that the association "will be able to contribute much to accomplishing the plan drawn up by this Congregation for worldwide sharing of clergy". Cardinal Wright was still recommending prospective seminarians to apply to Écône as late as 1973.&lt;ref name=Davies&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sspxasia.com/Documents/Archbishop-Lefebvre/Apologia/Vol_one/Chapter_2.htm|title=SSPXAsia.com: Apologia pro Marcel Lefebvre: chp 2: A New Apostolate|publisher=|accessdate=21 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The establishment of the SSPX was unwelcome to a number of churchmen, most notably to the French bishops, whose theological outlook was quite different from that of Lefebvre and who had important connections with the Vatican Cardinal Secretary of State, [[Jean-Marie Villot]]. Much of the tension between Lefebvre and his critics must be seen in the context of long-term theological, cultural and political divisions between opposing elements of French society. According to Michael Davies, a defender of Lefebvre, at the meeting of the French episcopal conference at Lourdes in 1972, the seminary at Écône acquired the nickname "le séminaire sauvage"&amp;nbsp;– the "wildcat seminary",&lt;ref name=Davies/&gt; and by November 1974 the French episcopate had indicated that they would not [[incardinate]] any of Lefebvre's priests in their dioceses. They also publicly criticised Catholics who remained attached to the Tridentine Mass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sspxasia.com/Documents/Archbishop-Lefebvre/Apologia/Vol_one/Chapter_4.htm|title=SSPXAsia.com: Apologia pro Marcel Lefebvre: Chapter 4: The Campaign Against Econe|publisher=|accessdate=21 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; By this time, the SSPX had opened additional seminaries in [[Armada, Michigan]], (1973) and in [[Rome]] (1974).

=== Canonical Visitation of Seminary ===
The first sign of intervention by curial authorities was a meeting held in the Vatican on 26 March 1974. By June 1974, a commission of cardinals had been formed to inquire into the SSPX. The cardinals decided that a canonical visitation of the seminary should be undertaken and, from 11–13 November 1974, two Belgian priests carried out a visitation. Franz Schmidberger, later superior general of the Society in 1990, said that their report was favourable.&lt;ref&gt;"Archbishop Lefebvre was told that this examination was very positive and that he just had to come to Rome and clarify some questions."[https://blogs.wsj.com/tech-europe/2012/03/08/attacks-on-spanish-and-vatican-sites-after-lulzsec-arrests/tab/comments/#comment-24165 Conference of Father Franz Schmidberger, superior general of the Society of St. Pius X] at Rockdale, Sydney, Australia, October 16, 1990, by Father Gerard Hogan and Father François Laisney&lt;/ref&gt; However, the seminarians and staff at Écône judged some theological opinions that the two priests expressed there to be excessively liberal and greatly shocking. In what he later described as a mood of "doubtlessly excessive indignation", Lefebvre wrote a "Declaration" in which he strongly attacked what he considered to be liberal trends apparent in the contemporary Church, which (he said) were "clearly evident" in the Council and in the reforms that had followed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archives.sspx.org/archbishop_lefebvre/1974_declaration_of_archbishop_lefebvre.htm The 1974 Declaration of Archbishop Lefebvre]，November 21, 1974&lt;/ref&gt; This document was leaked and published in January 1975, in the French Traditionalist Catholic journal ''Itinéraires''.

By now, Lefebvre was in serious difficulties.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt; In January 1975, Monsignor [[Pierre Mamie]], the Bishop of Fribourg, wrote to Rome stating his intention to withdraw the ''pia unio'' status that his predecessor had granted. In the same month, Lefebvre was asked by the cardinals to come to the Vatican. He met with them twice, on 13 February and 3 March. To Lefebvre's declared surprise, the meetings were hostile in tone: at one point a French cardinal, [[Gabriel-Marie Garrone]], reportedly called him a "fool".&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt;

=== Growing Tensions ===
On 6 May 1975, with the approval of the cardinals, Bishop Mamie withdrew the SSPX's ''pia unio'' status. Lefebvre instructed his lawyer to lodge appeals and he ultimately petitioned the [[Apostolic Signatura]], the highest court of the Catholic Church, which turned down the complaint. From this point onwards, the SSPX was no longer recognised as a canonical organization.

Lefebvre and the leadership of the society have always maintained that he was treated unfairly by the [[Roman Curia]], that the suppression of the SSPX was unjust and also that the procedures followed in its suppression violated the provisions of the [[1917 Code of Canon Law]].

The SSPX continued to operate in spite of its dissolution. In the [[papal consistory|consistory]] of 24 May 1976, [[Pope Paul VI]] rebuked Archbishop Lefebvre by name&amp;nbsp;– reportedly the first time in 200 years that a pope had publicly reprimanded a Catholic bishop&amp;nbsp;– and appealed to him and his followers to change their minds.&lt;ref&gt;Nos igitur iterum adhortamur hos Nostros fratres ac filios, eosque exoramus, ut conscii fiant gravium vulnerum quae secus Ecclesiae illaturi sunt.

Lefebvre announced that he intended to confer ordination on some of his students at the end of June 1976. On 12 June 1976, the Nuncio in Switzerland was given instructions to inform Lefebvre that, by special order of Pope Paul VI, he was forbidden to do so.&lt;ref name=suspension1&gt;[http://www.catholicculture.org/culture/library/view.cfm?id=1392&amp;CFID=29273879&amp;CFTOKEN=13104187#SUSPENSION%20AB%20ORDINUM The suspension ''ab ordinum collatione'' of Archbishop Lefebvre]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Text given in English translation in M. Davies, Apologia Pro Marcel Lefebvre, p. 194&lt;/ref&gt; On 25 June 1976, Archbishop [[Giovanni Benelli]], the deputy [[Secretariat of State (Holy See)|Secretary of State]], wrote directly to Lefebvre, confirming, by special mandate of the Pope, the prohibition to administer the holy orders, and warning him of the canonical penalties for Lefebvre himself and those whom he would ordain.&lt;ref name=suspension1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;English translation in M. Davies, Apologia Pro Marcel Lefebvre, p. 197-199&lt;/ref&gt; Lefebvre ignored the warnings, and went ahead with the ordinations on 29 June 1976.

In the sermon that he delivered on that occasion, Lefebvre explicitly recognized the possibility that he himself would be struck with suspension and the new priests with an irregularity that should theoretically prevent them from saying Mass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sspxasia.com/Documents/Archbishop-Lefebvre/Apologia/Vol_one/Chapter_11.htm|title=The Ordinations of 29 June 1976|publisher=|accessdate=21 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the next day, 1 July 1976, the Press Office of the Holy See declared that in accordance with canon 2373 of the then Code of Canon Law, Lefebvre was automatically suspended for one year from conferring ordination, and that those whom he had ordained were automatically suspended from the exercise of the order received. It was also announced that the Holy See was examining Lefebvre's disobedience to the orders of the Pope that were communicated by the above-mentioned letters of the Secretariat of State dated 12 and 15 June 1976.&lt;ref name=suspension1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;English translation of the statement in M. Davies, Apologia Pro Marcel Lefebvre, pp. 215-216&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 July 1976, Lefebvre signed a certificate of receipt of a letter from Cardinal [[Sebastiano Baggio]], Prefect of the [[Congregation for Bishops]], intimating to him a canonical warning that further penalties would be inflicted on him in accordance with canon 2331 §1 of the then Code of Canon Law concerning obstinate disobedience to legitimate precepts or prohibitions of the Roman Pontiff, unless within ten days of receipt of the letter he took steps "to repair the scandal caused". In a letter of 17 July to Pope Paul VI, Lefebvre declared that he judged his action of 29 June to be legitimate. The Pope considered this response inadequate and on his instructions the Congregation for Bishops, on 22 July 1976, suspended Lefebvre for an indefinite time from all exercise of holy orders- he could not confer any of the Sacraments, save Reconciliation or Baptism in a dire emergency (suspension "a divinis").&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholicculture.org/culture/library/view.cfm?id=1392&amp;CFID=29273879&amp;CFTOKEN=13104187#SUSPENSION%20A%20DIVINIS The suspension ''a divinis'' of Archbishop Lefebvre]&lt;/ref&gt;

===1988 Écône consecrations===
{{main|Écône consecrations}}
A central controversy surrounding the SSPX concerns the [[consecration]] by Archbishop Lefebvre and Brazilian bishop [[Antônio de Castro Mayer]] of four SSPX priests as bishops in 1988 in violation of the orders of [[Pope John Paul II]].

By 1987, Archbishop Lefebvre was 81. At that point, if Lefebvre had died, the SSPX would have become dependent upon non-SSPX bishops to ordain future priests&amp;nbsp;– and Lefebvre did not regard them as properly reliable and orthodox. In June 1987, Lefebvre announced his intention to consecrate a successor to the episcopacy. He implied that he intended to do this with or without the approval of the [[Holy See]].&lt;ref&gt;"The situation is such, the work placed in our hands by the good Lord is such, that faced with this darkness in Rome, faced with the Roman authorities' pertinacity in error, faced with this refusal to return to truth or tradition on the part of those who occupy the seats of authority in Rome, faced with all these things, it seems to us that the good Lord is asking for the Church to continue. This is why it is likely that before I give account of my life to the good Lord, I shall have to consecrate some bishops" ([http://www.sspxasia.com/Documents/Archbishop-Lefebvre/Bishops-to-save-the-church.htm Sermon on 29 June 1987])&lt;/ref&gt; Under canons 1013 and 1382 of the Catholic [[Canon law (Catholic Church)#Codification|Code of Canon Law]], the consecration of a bishop requires papal approval. Consecration of bishops without papal approval had been condemned by [[Pope Pius XII]] in his encyclical ''[[Ad Apostolorum principis]]'', which described the sacramental activity of bishops who had been consecrated without such approval as "gravely illicit, that is, criminal and sacrilegious".&lt;ref name="Ad"&gt;(Encyclical [http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/pius_xii/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-xii_enc_29061958_ad-apostolorum-principis_en.html Ad Apostolorum Principis], 41)&lt;/ref&gt; The Roman authorities were unhappy with Lefebvre's plan, but they began discussions with him and the SSPX which led to the signing on 5 May 1988, of a skeleton agreement between Lefebvre and Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, the prefect of the [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]] and the future [[Pope Benedict XVI]].

On [[Pope John Paul II]]'s instructions, Cardinal Ratzinger replied to Lefebvre on 30 May, insisting on observance of the agreement of 5 May and adding that, if Lefebvre carried out unauthorized consecrations on 30 June, the promised authorization for the ordination to the episcopacy would not be granted.

On 3 June, Lefebvre wrote from International Seminary of Saint Pius X, stating that he intended to proceed. On 9 June, the Pope replied with a personal letter, appealing to him not to proceed with a design that "would be seen as nothing other than a [[Schism (religion)|schismatic act]], the theological and canonical consequences of which are known to you". Lefebvre did not reply and the letter was made public on 16 June. For the first time the Holy See stated publicly that Lefebvre was in danger of being excommunicated.

On 30 June 1988, Archbishop Lefebvre proceeded to ordain to the episcopate four priests of the SSPX. Monsignor [[Antônio de Castro Mayer]], the retired Bishop of [[Campos dos Goytacazes]], [[Brazil]], assisted in the ceremony.  Those consecrated as Bishops were: [[Bernard Fellay]], [[Bernard Tissier de Mallerais]], [[Alfonso de Galarreta]], and [[Richard Williamson (bishop)|Richard Williamson]].

The following day, the Congregation for Bishops issued a decree declaring that Archbishop Lefebvre and the four newly ordained bishops had incurred the automatic canonical penalty of excommunication reserved to the Holy See.&lt;ref name="excommunication"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cin.org/users/james/files/l-excomm.htm|title=Decree of excommunication on Marcel Lefebvre|publisher=|accessdate=21 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the following day, 2 July, [[Pope John Paul II]] issued an apostolic letter known as ''[[Ecclesia Dei]]'' in which he condemned the Archbishop's action.&lt;ref name="Ecclesia"&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/motu_proprio/documents/hf_jp-ii_motu-proprio_02071988_ecclesia-dei_en.html Ecclesia Dei] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150129194411/http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/motu_proprio/documents/hf_jp-ii_motu-proprio_02071988_ecclesia-dei_en.html |date=January 29, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Pope stated that, since schism is defined in the [[Code of Canon Law]] as "withdrawal of submission to the Supreme Pontiff or from communion with the members of the Church subject to him" (canon 751),&lt;ref name="canon751"&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/_INDEX.HTM Canon 751] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080220062727/http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/_INDEX.HTM |date=February 20, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the consecration "constitute[d] a schismatic act", and that, by virtue of canon 1382 of the Code,&lt;ref name="canon1382"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P54.HTM|title=Code of Canon Law - IntraText|publisher=|accessdate=9 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; it entailed ipso facto excommunication for all the bishops involved.

Lefebvre argued that his actions had been necessary because the traditional form of the Catholic faith and sacraments would become extinct without Traditionalist clergy to pass them on to the next generation. He called the ordinations "''opération survie''" ("Operation Survival"), citing in his defense canons 1323 and [[canon 1324|1324]] of the 1917 Code of Canon Law, the first of which says that "a person who acted coerced by grave fear, even if only relatively grave, or due to necessity or grave inconvenience unless the act is intrinsically evil or tends to the harm of souls" is not subject to penalty for violating a law or precept, while the other says "the perpetrator of a violation is not exempt from a penalty, but the penalty established by law or precept must be tempered or a penance employed in its place if the delict was committed ... by a person who thought in culpable error that one of the circumstances mentioned in can. 1323, nn. 4 or 5 was present".&lt;ref name="canon1323"&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P4W.HTM Canon 1323] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071224152526/http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P4W.HTM |date=December 24, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some members of the SSPX disassociated themselves from the Society as a result of Lefebvre's actions and, with the approval of the Holy See, formed a separate society called the [[Priestly Fraternity of Saint Peter]].

===Discussions with the Holy See===
{{Main|Dialogue between the Holy See and the Society of Saint Pius X}}
Discussions between the Holy See and the Society of Saint Pius X towards an eventual reconciliation have been ongoing. For years after the 1988 consecrations, there was little if any dialogue between the SSPX and the Holy See. This state of affairs ended when the Society led a large pilgrimage to Rome for the [[Jubilee (Christianity)#"Great Jubilee" of 2000|"Great Jubilee" of 2000]].

Nine years later, on January 21, 2009 the Holy See remitted the excommunications of the Society's bishops that it had declared at the time of the 1988 consecrations and expressed the hope that all members of the society would follow this up by speedily returning to full communion with the Church.

Discussions since then have been complex, stemming from the Society's insistence that the teachings of the [[Second Vatican Council]] on [[ecumenism]], [[freedom of religion|religious liberty]], and [[collegiality]] are inconsistent with Catholic teaching and doctrine, a claim that the Holy See views as unacceptable, but recent discussions have indicated the possibility of an understanding. In an interview on 4 March 2017 with DICI, the official news organ of the Society, Bishop [[Bernard Fellay]] stated "Whether it is a question of religious liberty, collegiality, ecumenism, the new Mass, or even the new rites of the sacraments…. all of a sudden, on these points that have been stumbling blocks, the emissaries from Rome tell us that they are open questions."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dici.org/en/news/interview-with-bp-bernard-fellay-march-4-2016-menzingen-switzerland/|title=Interview with Bp. Bernard Fellay|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same month of March 2017, Archbishop Guido Pozzo, the prelate in charge of the [[Pontifical Commission Ecclesia Dei|Pontifical Commission ''Ecclesia Dei'']], the [[Roman Curia]]'s organ for traditionalist societies, stated that the Holy See and the Society were close to an agreement regularizing the Society's status.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.catholicculture.org/news/headlines/index.cfm?storyid=31058|title=Vatican official confirms: agreement with SSPX is close : News Headlines|website=www.catholicculture.org|access-date=2017-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a letter of the same month it was announced that Pope Francis authorized diocesan bishops to grant to SSPX priests faculties to officiate at a marriage valid in the Catholic Church in cases where no priest in good standing could do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.news.va/en/news/new-pastoral-provisions-for-sacrament-of-marriage|title=New pastoral provisions for Sacrament of Marriage for SSPX|access-date=2017-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2017 Bishop Fellay signed a document along with a number of other clergy and academics labeled as a "Fraternal Correction" of Pope Francis. The twenty-five page document, which was made public in September after receiving no reply from the Holy See, criticized the Pope for allegedly promoting heresy through various words, actions and omissions during his pontificate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.correctiofilialis.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Correctio-filialis_English_1.pdf|title=Correctio filialis de haeresibus propagates}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Conservative Theologians Accuse Pope of Spreading Heresy"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2017/09/23/world/europe/ap-eu-rel-vatican-heresy.html|title=Conservative Theologians Accuse Pope of Spreading Heresy|work=New York Times|access-date=September 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Canonical situation==
{{Main|Canonical situation of the Society of Saint Pius X}}
The canonical situation of the SSPX and of its clergy has been the subject of controversy since the 1988 Écône consecrations.  While the Society is not listed in ''Annuario Pontificio'' as a recognized society of apostolic life, it has nonetheless benefited from many significant allowances normally granted only to recognized orders and societies.  In the November–December 2017 edition of ''The Angelus'', Fr. Francois Knittel, SSPX, wrote "The Church authorities have gradually recognized the liceity and the validity of the ministry performed by the priests of the SSPX."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Knittel|first=Francois|date=November–December 2017|title=Canon Law and Pastoral Theology of Marriage|url=|journal=The Angelus|volume=40|pages=77-82|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Marriage ===
On 27 March 2017, the [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]] communicated that Pope Francis had decided to grant local ordinaries the right to give to a priest in good standing the faculty to preside at the marriage of followers of the Society, immediately after which they will participate in a Mass celebrated by an SSPX priest, or, if no priest in good standing can receive the consent of the couple, to give the faculty instead to an SSPX priest.  Previously, in 2008, the Pontifical Commission ''Ecclesia Dei'' had stated "The priests of the Society of St. Pius X are... prohibited from exercising their priestly functions," going on to conclude that, in the case of matrimony, "these sacraments are invalid," since a suspended priest lacks the proper delegation from the bishop.&lt;ref name="McNamara" /&gt; 

=== Confession ===
On 20 November, 2016, Pope Francis personally extended an allowance he created during the Holy Year of 2015, whereby penitents confessing to priests affiliated with the SSPX "shall validly and licitly receive the absolution of their sins."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iubilaeummisericordiae.va/content/gdm/en/giubileo/lettera.html|title=Letter|website=www.iubilaeummisericordiae.va}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Ordination and Holy Orders ===
During an interview with ''TV Libertes'' on 29 January, 2017, Bishop Fellay announced that theological discussions with the Vatican had led to permission for the Society to licitly ordain priests: "This summer it was confirmed that the Superior General can freely ordain the priests of the Society without having to ask permission from the local bishop."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.catholicculture.org/news/headlines/index.cfm?storyid=31663|title=SSPX Bishops Authorized to Ordain Priests Without Permission of Local Bishops|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mass ===
In 2011, Father Edward McNamara, professor of liturgy and dean of theology at the Regina Apostolorum university in Rome, said that, for Catholics, assistance at Mass celebrated by priests of the Society is not necessarily a sin: "It would only become so if a person attended this Mass with the deliberate intention of separating himself from communion with the Pope and those in communion with him." However, he concluded: "Only if there is objectively no alternative should one attend the Mass celebrated by a priest from the Society of St. Pius X. If one has to do so, then I would say that one may go in good conscience."&lt;ref name="McNamara"&gt;[https://zenit.org/articles/mass-with-the-society-of-st-pius-x/ Father Edward McNamara, ''Mass with the Society of St Pius X'']&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Jurisdiction ===
When told by a journalist of InfoVaticana, a provider of religious information founded in Madrid in October 2013,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infocif.es/ficha-empresa/infovaticana-sl|title=INFOVATICANA SL, MADRID - Informe comercial, de riesgo, financiero y mercantil.|website=www.infocif.es}}&lt;/ref&gt; that what Pope Francis had decided in March 2017 was instead that, "from now on, the weddings celebrated by the priests from the FSSPX are going to be recognized", Cardinal [[Raymond Leo Burke]], who had not seen the actual document, remarked: "That is a very significant action of the Holy Father, and it also indicates that in some way there must be a reconciliation of the FSSPX because basically what the Pope is saying is that the priests in this society, when they witness marriages, are exercising jurisdiction in the Roman Catholic Church."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://infovaticana.com/2017/04/10/interview-burke/|title=Burke: 'There is a very dangerous confusion and also with the confusion come divisions'|date=2017-04-10|website=Infovaticana|access-date=2017-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In reality, it is [[Ordinary (officer)#Local ordinaries/hierarchs|local ordinaries]], not the Society, that in the document are authorized, if they wish, to delegate jurisdiction to SSPX priests to assist canonically at some marriages.

The Society's view is that, before Pope Francis's authorizations, their priests held "supplied" jurisdiction (power of governance) for confessions and marriages. They received this supplied jurisdiction by law and not "by delegation or by mandate of the Sovereign Pontiff or the diocesan bishops or of regularly appointed parish priests".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://archives.sspx.org/miscellaneous/supplied_jurisdiction/supplied_jurisdiction.htm |title=Supplied jurisdiction &amp; traditional priests|first=Tissier |last=de Mallerais|publisher=Society of Saint Pius X, United States District|access-date=2017-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=jurisdiction1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sspx.org/en/faq-page/do-sspx-priests-have-jurisdiction-1992|title=Do SSPX Priests Have Jurisdiction|author=SSPX|accessdate=2014-07-13|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714195421/http://sspx.org/en/faq-page/do-sspx-priests-have-jurisdiction-1992|archivedate=2014-07-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=jurisdiction2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sspx.org/en/validity-sspxs-confessions-marriages|title=Validity of SSPX Confessions and Marriages|author=Fr Ramon Angles|accessdate=2014-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the grants by Pope Francis, the Society says, its priests have or can have ordinary jurisdiction for the sacraments of confession and marriage. It adds that, in cases where a diocesan bishop refuses to grant delegation for a marriage, SSPX priests can still use extraordinary jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sspx.org/en/news-events/news/sspx-marriages-are-incontestable-29003|title=SSPX Marriages are Incontestable - District of the USA|website=sspx.org|language=en|access-date=2017-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International Seminary of Saint Pius X|first seminary]] founded by the Society (St. Pius X Seminary) is located in Écône, Switzerland. Its largest,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://rorate-caeli.blogspot.com/2016/11/sspx-exclusive-bp-fellay-speaks-to.html|title=RORATE CÆLI: SSPX Exclusive - Bp.

The seminary, having outgrown its previous facilities, recently relocated from Winona, Minnesota; the former seminary complex continues to house the novitiate of the religious brothers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://stas.org/en/news-events/news/new-future-winona-moving-day|title=A New Future for Winona &amp; Moving Day! - St. Thomas Aquinas Seminary|website=stas.org|language=en|access-date=2017-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other seminaries are located in France ([[Flavigny-sur-Ozerain]]), Germany (Zaitzkofen), Australia (Goulburn), and Argentina (La Reja).  The Society also runs pre-seminaries for prospective priestly vocations in Italy (Albano Laziale), and the Philippines (Santa Barbara).

If the Society's canonical situation were to be regularized, it would be the Church's 4th largest society of apostolic life (similar to a religious order, but without vows), according to the three criteria published annually in ''Annuario Pontificio'': Number of erected houses (median 31; SSPX 167), number of members in the society (median 229; SSPX 971), and number of priests in the society (median 149; SSPX 640).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Annuario Pontificio, 2016|last=|first=|publisher=Libreria Editrice Vaticana|year=2016|isbn=|location=|pages=1467–1476}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Allies and Supporters ===
The SSPX has received explicit support from the following diocesan bishops:
* [[Salvador Lazo Lazo]], [[Roman Catholic Diocese of San Fernando de La Union|Bishop of San Fernando de La Unión]], Philippines (''deceased'')
* [[John Bosco Manat Chuabsamai]], [[Diocese of Ratchaburi|Bishop of Ratchaburi]], Thailand (born {{birth date and age|1935|10|31|df=yes}} resigned on 24 July 2003)
* [[Antônio de Castro Mayer]], bishop of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Campos]], Brazil (''deceased'')

Bishop Mayer resigned canonically on 20 August 1981; he later participated in the 1988 Écône consecrations, declaring "my presence here at this ceremony is a matter of conscience: It is the duty of a profession of the Catholic Faith before the entire Church."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mayer|first=Castro|date=1993|title=Declaration|url=|journal=Is Tradition Excommunicated?|volume=|pages=95–96|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his retirement, Bishop Mayer founded the [[Personal Apostolic Administration of Saint John Mary Vianney|Priestly Union of St Jean-Marie Vianney]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adapostolica.org/modules/wfsection/article.php?articleid=301 Nossa pequena história dentro da história da Igreja] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716180753/http://www.adapostolica.org/modules/wfsection/article.php?articleid=301 |date=July 16, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which remained closely associated with the SSPX until 2001, when it reconciled with the Holy See.

The Society now has close links with the [[Priestly Society of Saint Josaphat]], led by Father [[Basil Kovpak]], a priest formerly of the [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church]], who was definitively excommunicated from the Catholic Church in November 2007&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cwnews.com/news/viewstory.cfm?recnum=54919|title=Catholic News|publisher=|accessdate=21 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; after having Bishop [[Richard Williamson (bishop)|Richard Williamson]], then of the SSPX but expelled from the Society five years later,&lt;ref&gt;{{webarchive |url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20121205203505/http://www.catholicnews.com/data/stories/cns/1204487.htm |title=Cindy Wooden, "SSPX expels Bishop Williamson, who opposed talks with Vatican" in ''Catholic News Service'', 24 October 2012 |date=2012-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; illicitly ordain two priests and seven deacons for his society in violation of [http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P3N.HTM canons 1015 §1 and 1017] of the Code of Canon Law.

Several religious institutes, mostly based in France, are associated with the Society. A specific article, [[SSPX-affiliated religious orders]], is devoted to them.

===Notable groups that have split from the SSPX===
&lt;!--This is not to be a list of every group breaking off from the SSPX, but rather the most material/meaningful ones.--&gt;
There have been two major kinds of splits from the SSPX. Two notable splits of the first kind involved priests who viewed the SSPX as too liberal and who use the form that the Mass had before [[Pope John XXIII]]. The other kind involved groups who have reconciled with the Holy See and who, like the SSPX, use the 1962 edition of the Roman Missal.

Groups which broke with the SSPX and ''are not'' recognized by the Holy See include:
* [[Society of Saint Pius V]]&amp;nbsp;— In 1983, nine U.S. SSPX priests broke with or were forced to leave the SSPX's Northeast USA District partly because they were opposed to Lefebvre's instructions that Mass be celebrated according to the 1962 edition of the Roman Missal issued by Pope John XXIII.  Those in SSPX circles refer to these priests as "the nine".  They began their organization by refusing to complete a transaction of a church that the SSPX was attempting to purchase, using one of the nine priests as the buyer.  The founding priests took the money intended for the purchase of the church and kept the church for themselves.{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}  A number of the SSPV's priests and the lay people who go to their Masses are openly [[Sedevacantism|Sedevacantist]], a thesis rejected by the SSPX.  Other issues occasioning the split were: Lefebvre's order that Society priests must accept the decrees of nullity handed down by diocesan marriage tribunals; the insistence that all Society Masses be celebrated according to the 1962 edition of the Roman Missal; the acceptance of new members into the group who had been ordained to the priesthood according to the revised sacramental rites of [[Pope Paul VI]].&lt;ref&gt;Additional objections can be found at the "anti-Vatican II" Traditional Mass Organisation's [http://www.traditionalmass.org/articles/article.php?id=48&amp;catname=12I website]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Istituto Mater Boni Consilii]] — (English: "Institute of the Mother of Good Counsel") is a traditionalist congregation of priests that follows the [[Sedeprivationism|Sedeprivationist]] school of thought. The founders of the institute seceded in 1985 from the Society of St. Pius X under the leadership of Fr. Francesco Ricossa, onetime faculty member of the seminary at Écône. In contrast to the North American-based SSPV, this Institute is based in Europe.
* [[SSPX Resistance]] — Concern that the discussions with the Holy See that began in 2009 were leading the Society towards acceptance of the Second Vatican Council as the price of obtaining recognition led to the defection not only of Bishop Williamson but also of several priest members, in both North America and France. These referred to themselves variously as "the Resistance", the Society of St. Pius X Marian Corps (SSPX-MC), or l'Union Sacerdotale Marcel Lefebvre (USML, [[French language|French]]).

Groups which broke with the SSPX and reconciled with Rome include:
* [[Priestly Fraternity of Saint Peter]]&amp;nbsp;– It was established in 1988 after the Écône consecrations. Responding to the Holy See's declaration that these constituted a schismatic act and that those involved were thereby automatically excommunicated, twelve priests left the Society and established the Fraternity, in full communion with the Holy See.
* [[Institute of the Good Shepherd]]&amp;nbsp;– (''Institut du Bon-Pasteur'', IBP) was established as a papally-recognised society of apostolic life on 8 September 2006 for a group of SSPX members who maintained it was time for the Society to accept reconciliation with Pope Benedict XVI.

==Controversies==
{{Main|Controversies surrounding the Society of Saint Pius X}}

=== Political ===
{{Wikinews|Holocaust denial bishop apologizes}}
The Society unequivocally condemn Nazism, confirming the principles in [[Pope Pius XI]]'s 1937 encyclical ''Mit brennender Sorge'' which explicitly denounces the Nazis.

The Society also points out that Archbishop Lefebvre's own father, Renè Lefebvre, met his death in the concentration camp at Sonnenburg in February, 1944, three years after his arrest by the Gestapo; he died, "his rosary in hand, a victim of Nazi insanity."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fsspx.org/en/priest-and-missionary|title=Founder: Priest and Missionary|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Bishop Richard Williamson, the subject of the complaint by the Anti-Defamation League, denied in an interview published in 2009 (for which he was later convicted of [[Holocaust denial]] by a German court)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/jewish-world/jewish-world-news/german-court-convicts-british-holocaust-denying-bishop-1.494439 "German court convicts British Holocaust-denying bishop"], ''Haaretz''/Associated Press, 16 January 2013&lt;/ref&gt; the use of Nazi gas chambers to massacre Jews, the superior general of the Society said that, if he repeated his denial, he would be expelled.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.catholicculture.org/news/headlines/index.cfm?storyid=2170&amp;repos=4&amp;subrepos=2&amp;searchid=1706950|title=Bishop Fellay to Expel Bishop Williamson if He Denies Holocaust Again|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; His actual expulsion in 2012 was for refusing to show due respect and obedience to the SSPX authorities and calling on the superior general to resign.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.catholicculture.org/news/headlines/index.cfm?storyid=16028&amp;repos=4&amp;subrepos=2&amp;searchid=1706950|title=Bishop Williamson Ousted from SSPX|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was in an SSPX priory that French [[Collaboration with the Axis Powers|Nazi collaborator]] and [[war crime|war criminal]] [[Paul Touvier]] was arrested. The superiors of the priory had granted him asylum as "an act of charity to a homeless man".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.angelusonline.org/print.php?sid=831 AngelusOnline Page 831] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928040757/http://www.angelusonline.org/print.php?sid=831 |date=2007-09-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They had no knowledge about the man’s background when he first appeared in the priory, and Touvier was indeed homeless at the time. On his death, in 1996, a [[Requiem Mass]] was offered for his soul, upon his request.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.liberation.fr/portrait/010162986-vade-retro-soutanas "Vade retro Soutanas"], ("[[Temptation of Christ|Get Thee Behind me, Satan]]"), ''[[Libération]]'', 11  October 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ncronline.org/news/lefebvre-movement-long-troubled-history-judaism "Lefebvre movement: long, troubled history with Judaism"], ''[[National Catholic Reporter]]'', 26  January 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 October 2013, the Society offered to perform a funeral for Nazi [[war crimes|war-criminal]] [[Erich Priebke]]. However, Erich Priebke, who was baptized a Protestant, in the post-war years converted to Catholicism with his wife and had his children baptized.&lt;ref&gt;Erich Priebke, Autobiografia (Rome: Associazione uomo e liberta, 2003), 150, 160, 161, 170.&lt;/ref&gt; On the occasion of the public audience in front of the Military Tribunal of Rome held on April 3, 1996, he read a letter in the presence of the families of the victims, in which he manifested his grief, deploring the horrible act of obedience that he had had to perform in those circumstances:&lt;blockquote&gt;From the depths of my heart I feel the need to express my condolences for the sorrow of the relatives of the victims of the Ardeatine Caves.... As a believer I have never denied this tragic fact; for me the order to participate in the action was a great personal tragedy.... I think of the dead with reverence and I feel united with the living in their sorrow."&lt;ref&gt;Exclusive interview granted to Francesco Giorgino, after Priebke was sentenced to prison. See YouTube, “Guai ai vinti, storia di Erich Priebke 10/11” [“Woe to the defeated, the story of Erich Priebke 10/11”].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; He rejected the cult of race as a “mistake that led down a path of no return”.&lt;ref&gt;Erich Priebke, Autobiografia (Rome: Associazione uomo e liberta, 2003), 150, 160, 161, 170.&lt;/ref&gt;
Despite all of that the ceremony did not take place due to protests by some 500 people, mostly unaware of the circumstances of his personal life, outside the Society's Italian district house in [[Albano Laziale|Albano]], near Rome. The local authorities of the Catholic Church had refused him a public funeral, citing a rule of canon law that, unless they gave some signs of repentance before death, a public funeral must be refused to manifest sinners to whom it cannot be granted without public scandal of the faithful.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ncronline.org/news/global/nazi-war-criminals-sspx-funeral-stopped-protests "Nazi war criminal's SSPX funeral stopped by protests"] by Cindy Wooden, [[Catholic News Service]],16 October 2013,&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P4C.HTM|title=Code of Canon Law - IntraText|publisher=|accessdate=9 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Alleged cover-up of abuse ===
On April 5, 2017, [[Uppdrag granskning]], a Swedish television program focused on investigative journalism, alleged that four members of the SSPX—three priests and a former seminarian—had molested at least a dozen young people in several countries.&lt;ref name="ipppavagh"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicculture.org/news/headlines/index.cfm?storyid=31222|title=SSPX accused of abuse cover-up : News Headlines|website=www.catholicculture.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.svt.se/nyheter/granskning/ug/new-cover-ups-of-assaults-by-catholic-priests|accessdate=2018-10-16|date=2017-04-05|title=New cover-ups of assaults by Catholic priests|publisher=SVT Nyheter Gransking}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=[[Sveriges Television|SVT Nyheter]]|url=https://www.svt.se/nyheter/granskning/ug/pope-helped-sspx-after-scandal-with-holocaust-denying-bishop|accessdate=2018-10-16|date=2017-04-05|title=Pope helped SSPX after scandal with Holocaust-denying bishop}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program also stated that evidence of abuse was kept secret by the SSPX and that the priests were allowed to continue in ministry.&lt;ref name="ipppavagh" /&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mediapart.fr/en/journal/international/050417/hidden-sex-abuse-cases-franco-swiss-catholic-priest-fraternity|title=The hidden sex abuse cases at a Franco-Swiss Catholic priest fraternity|first=Mathieu Martiniere, Mathieu Périsse, Daphné Gastaldi (We report) et Ali Fegan|last=(SVT1)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, three of the four had been expelled from the Society by the time that the program was aired.

Kevin Gerard Sloniker, the former seminarian and the only person accused by name in the program, was expelled from the Society's St. Thomas Aquinas Seminary in 2005, and began serving a life-sentence in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2015/10/30/former-seminarian-anti-semitic-church-charged-sexual-abuse-boys|title=Former Seminarian for Anti-Semitic Church Charged with Sexual Abuse of Boys|work=Southern Poverty Law Center|access-date=2017-04-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.spokesman.com/stories/2016/oct/28/trucker-who-molested-boys-from-his-church-will-spe/|title=Trucker who molested boys from his church will spend at least 35 years in prison|work=Spokesman.com|access-date=2017-04-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The remaining three accusations regard priests whose names have been withheld (referred to in the program as Fathers P, S, and M); their accusers have likewise remained anonymous.  Nonetheless, P was the subject of a canonical trial presided over by Bishop Fellay, authorized by the Vatican in 2013; he was found guilty, and subsequently ordered to retire to a monastery.  Crux reports "P refused to go and, according to officials of the SSPX, joined [Bishop] [[SSPX Resistance|Williamson's Resistance]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cruxnow.com/global-church/2017/04/05/report-charges-cover-traditionalist-society/|title=Report charges cover-up of sexual abuse by traditionalist society|date=5 April 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He along with "Father S" were expelled from the Society, and are now affiliated with Williamson's group.  "Father M" is currently serving in France, though no criminal charges have been brought against him and the Society denies that they are aware of any credible accusations of abuse against the priest.

=== SSPX priests sentenced for abuse ===

Mexican SSPX priest and former headmaster Fr. Uribe Silviano Bernabé was sentenced in September 2004 by a Bordeaux criminal court to one year for sexual assaults on a grown up woman and a 13-year old girl&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cronica.com.mx/notas/2005/172361.html|title=EU considera pedófilos a dos curas que ofician en México|website=www.cronica.com.mx|language=es-MX|access-date=2018-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

He then brought the case to the [[Court of Cassation (France)|Court of Cassation]] in Paris, which upheld the sentence on April 26, 2006&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Cour de Cassation, Chambre criminelle, du 26 avril 2006, 05-84.841, Inédit|url=https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichJuriJudi.do?idTexte=JURITEXT000007637891|access-date=2018-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

On December 13, 2017, Fr. Frédéric Abbet was sentenced to 5 years by a Brussels appeal court for sexual abuse on a young boy in an SSPX boarding school.

The '''Sukerchakia'''  [[Misl]]  was one of 12 Sikh Misls in [[Punjab region|Punjab]] during the 18th century concentrated in [[Gujranwala]] and [[Hafizabad]] district in Western [[Punjab region|Punjab]] (in modern-[[Pakistan]]) and ruled from (1752-1801).this misl was [[Sandhawalia]] [[Jat]] misl. The Sukerchakia last Misldar (commander of the Misl) was Maharaja [[Ranjit Singh]]. Towards the end of the eighteenth century, Maharaja [[Ranjit Singh]] united all the [[misls]] and established an independent kingdom in Punjab.

== History ==
[[File:Maharaja Ranjit Singh family.jpg|left|200px|thumb|Maharaja Ranjit Singh's family genealogy.]]
Sardar Naudh Singh on becoming Khalsa was given a petty tract of land around [[Gujranwala]] that he renamed as Shukar Chak i.e. Thanks for the land.  Sardar [[Charat Singh]] was the eldest son of Sardar Naudh Singh, the father of Maha Singh, and the grandfather of Ranjit Singh.  Charat Singh created the Shukarchakia band or Misl.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Khushwant Singh |first= |editor-last= |editor-first= |title=Ranjit Singh, Maharaja of the Punjab |publisher=Penguin Books, India |date=2008 |pages=1–3 |chapter=Chapter 1: Ranjit Singh's Ancestors, Birth and the Years of Tutelage |isbn=9780143065432 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sikh-history.com/sikhhist/warriors/charat.html&lt;/ref&gt;

He extended his rule in [[Rohtas, Pakistan|Rohtas]], [[Chakwal]], Pind Dadan Khan which Stood in Pothohar Region of Northern Punjab and took [[Wazirabad]] under his control. Then came Sardar Maha Singh (d.1792) who also expanded the Misl further.

A Svikiro is an ancestral spirit primarily known to possess a living human  and will give advice based on that communication.&lt;ref name="ogot-1992"/&gt;

The word comes from the verb ''kusvika'' meaning 'to arrive at or reach a place'.It also stems from "kusvikirwa" meaning 'to arrive upon' , as it is believed that the ancestral spirits arrive in the bodies of the mediums.  &lt;ref name="ogot-1992"/&gt;

Other types of mediums (svikiro) include "mhondoro" which are possessed by the ancestor spirits of the same name. Mhondoro means lion in the Shona Language.

The '''''Tashahhud''''' ({{lang-ar|تَشَهُّد}}), meaning the testimony of [[Iman (concept)|faith]], also known as '''Attahiyat''') is the portion of the [[Salah|Muslim prayer]] where the precant sits on the ground facing the ''[[qibla]]'', [[Tasbih|glorifies]] [[God in Islam|God]], and greets the [[Muhammad|messenger]] and the righteous people of God followed by the [[Shahada|two testimonials]]. The recitation is followed by an invocation of the blessings and peace upon the prophet known as [[Salawat|''Salawat'' or ''Darood'']].

{{Islam|prayer}}

==Origins==
There is a ''[[Hadith]]'', thought to be [[Sahih|authentic]] that states:&lt;ref name="Bukhari"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://sunnah.com/urn/153690 |title=Hadith - Asking Permission  - Sahih al-Bukhari -  Sunnah.com - Sayings and Teachings of Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم) |website=sunnah.com |access-date=2017-11-14 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171115015608/https://sunnah.com/urn/153690 |archivedate=2017-11-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|Narrated Ibn Mas`uud: 
Ibn Mas'ud is reported to have said that the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) taught me tashahhud taking my hand within his palms, in the same way as he taught me the chapter of the Quran, and we also read it after his passing away.}}

== Sunni tradition ==
=== Hanafi and Hanbali ===
[[Sunni Muslims]] from both the [[Hanafi]] and the [[Hanbali]] schools of thought and the minority [[Ibadi]] sect recite the Tashahhud (attributed to [[Abdullah ibn Masud]]) as:
{{quote|At-taḥiyyātu lillāhi, wa -ṣ-ṣalawātu wa -ṭ-ṭayyibātu. As-salāmu ʿalayka ayyuhā n-nabīyyu wa-raḥmatu llāhi wa-barakātuh. As-salāmu ʿalaynā wa-ʿalā ʿibādi llāhi ṣ-ṣāliḥīn. Ašhadu an lā ilāha illā llāhu wa-ašhadu anna Muḥammadan ʿabduhu wa-rasūluh.}}
{{script/Arabic|التَّحِيَّاتُ لِلّٰهِ وَالصَّلَوَاتُ وَالطَّيِّبَاتُ، اَلسَّلَامُ عَلَيْكَ أَيُّهَا النَّبِيُّ وَرَحْمَةُ اللهِ وَبَرَكَاتُهُ، اَلسَّلَامُ عَلَيْنَا وَ عَلٰى عِبَادِ اللهِ الصَّالِحِيْنَ، أَشْهَدُ أَنْ لَا إِلٰهَ إِلَّا اللهُ، وَأَشْهَدُ أَنَّ مُحَمَّدًا عَبْدُهُ وَ رَسُوْلُهُ}}

This translates as:
"Salutations to God and prayers and good deeds. Peace be upon you, O Prophet, and the mercy of God and his blessings. Peace be on us and on the righteous servants of God. I bear witness that there is no god but Allah, and I bear witness that Muhammad is His servant and His messenger."

=== Maliki ===
A variant attributed to [[Umar]] (preferred by the [[Maliki]] school of thought) is:
{{quote|At-taḥiyyātu li-llāh az-zakiyyātu li-llāh aṭ-ṭayyibātu-ṣ-ṣalawātu li-llāh. As-salāmu ʿalayka ʾayyuha-n-nabiyyu wa raḥmat Allāhi wa barakātuhu. As-salāmu ʿalayna wa ʿalā ʿibād illāhi-ṣ-ṣalihīn. ʾAsh-hadu ʾan lā ʾilāha ill-Allāh wa ash-hadu anna Muḥammadan ʿabduhu wa rasūluhu.}} 
{{script/Arabic|التَّحِيَّاتُ لِلَّهِ الزَّاكِيَاتُ لِلَّهِ الطَّيِّبَاتُ الصَّلَوَاتُ لِلَّهِ السَّلاَمُ عَلَيْكَ أَيُّهَا النَّبِيُّ وَرَحْمَةُ اللَّهِ وَبَرَكَاتُهُ السَّلاَمُ عَلَيْنَا وَعَلَى عِبَادِ اللَّهِ الصَّالِحِينَ أَشْهَدُ أَنْ لاَ إِلَهَ إِلاَّ اللَّهُ وَأَشْهَدُ أَنَّ مُحَمَّدًا عَبْدُهُ وَرَسُولُهُ}}

This translates as:
"Blessed salutations, pure actions, good words and prayers to God. Peace be upon you, O Prophet, and the mercy of God and His blessings. Peace be on us and on the righteous servants of God. I  bear witness that there is no god other than ALLAH and I  bear witness that Muhammad is His servant and messenger."

=== Shafii ===
Another variant preferred by Sunni Muslims belonging to [[Shafii]] school of thought is:
{{quote|at-tāḥīyyātu-l-mubārakātu ṣ-ṣalawātu ṭ-ṭayyibātu li-llāh. as-salāmu ʿalayka ʾayyuhā n-nabī wa-raḥmat allāhi wa-barakātuhu. as-salāmu ʿalayna wāʿala ʿibād illāhi ṣ-ṣāliḥīn. ʾashhadu ʾan lā ʾilāha illā -llāh wa-ʾashhadu ʾanna muḥammadan rasūlu -llāh.}}
{{script/Arabic|التحيات المباركات الصلوات الطيبات لله، السلام عليك أيها النبي ورحمة الله وبركاته، السلام علينا، وعلى عباد الله الصالحين، أشهد أن لا إله إلا الله، وأشهد أن محمداً رسول الله}}
&lt;br /&gt;

This translates as:
"Blessed salutations, prayers, good deeds to God. Peace be upon you, O Prophet, and the mercy of God and His blessings. Peace be on us and on the righteous servants of God. I bear witness that there is no god but God, and I bear witness that Muhammad is His  messenger."

== Shi'ite tradition ==
[[File:Meeting of the 7th Cabinet members with Leader Ali Khamenei - Praying - August 28, 2000 (Cropped on Khatami).jpg|150px|thumb|President [[Mohammad Khatami]], who is a Shia cleric, in Tashahhud during a Salat.]]

=== Jafari ===
The [[Twelver|Imami]] [[Shi'ites]] of the [[Ja'fari]] school recite the Tashahhud as:
{{quote|ʾashhadu ʾan lā ilāha illā -llāh waẖdahu lā sharīka lahu wa-ʾashhadu ʾanna muḥhammadan ʿabduhu wa-rasūluhu. allāhumma ṣalla ʿala muḥammadin wa-ʾāl muḥammad.&lt;ref name="sistani.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sistani.org/english/book/49/2406/|title=Dialogue on prayer (1) - Jurisprudence Made Easy - The Official Website of the Office of His Eminence Al-Sayyid Ali Al-Husseini Al-Sistani|website=www.sistani.org|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160424235226/http://www.sistani.org/english/book/49/2406/|archivedate=2016-04-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
أشهد أن لا إله إلا الله وحده لا شريك له, وأشهد أنّ محمدا عبده ورسوله. اللهم صلى على محمد وآل محمد 
&lt;br /&gt;

This translates as:
"I  bear witness that there is no god but God the One and no partner to Him, and I  bear witness that Muhammad is His servant and His prophet. O God bestow blessings upon Muhammad and the household of Muhammad."

The Tashahhud is followed by the Taslim.

The bare minimum is to say 
"Assalamu Alaikum" (Peace be with you) السَّلاَمُ عَلَيْكُمْ.
It is highly recommended, though, to add "Wa Rahmatul Lahi wa Barakatuh" (and God’s mercy and blessings) وَرَحْمَةُ اللهِ  وَبَرَكَاتُهُ.&lt;ref name="sistani.org"/&gt;

It is highly recommended, though, to recite
{{quote|Assalmu Alaika Ayyuhan Nabiyu wa Rahmatul Lahi wa Barakatuh, Assalamu Alaina wa Ala Ibadil Lahis Saliheen Assalamu Alaikum wa Rahmatul Lahi wa Barakatuh&lt;ref name="sistani.org"/&gt;}}
السلام عليك أيها النبي ورحمة الله وبركاته
السلام علينا وعلى عباد الله الصالحين
السَّلاَمُ عَلَيْكُمْ وَرَحْمَةُ اللهِ  وَبَرَكَاتُهُ
&lt;br /&gt;

This translates as:
"May peace, mercy of the Almighty and His blessings be with you, Oh Prophet. May peace be with us and the good among Allah’s servants. May peace, mercy, and blessings of the Almighty be with you."

=== Zaidi ===
For the [[Zaidiyyah|Zaidi]], the middle Tashahhud after the second rakʿah is recited as:
{{quote|Bismillahi wa Billahiwa alhamdulillahi wal-asmā`ul-husna kulluhā lillahi. Ashhadu an lā ilāha ila Allāhu wahdahu lā sharīka lahu wa ashhadu anna Muhammadan abduhu wa rasūluhu&lt;ref name="Zaydi" /&gt;}}

After the last rakʿah, the Zaidi recite the Tashahhud in its full formula:
{{quote|Bismillahi wa Billahi wa alhamdulillahi wal-asmā`ul-husna kulluhā lillahi.&lt;ref name="Zaydi"&gt;}} This aforementioned wording ("Bismillah wa Billahi...") does appear in Zaydi books of hadith such as the Musnad of Imam Zayd (as), Amaali of Ahmed bin Isa bin Zayd (as), Sharh at-Tajreed and other books of hadith with complete chains of narrators. Its legitimacy and authenticity does not depend on whether Sunni narrators report it or not. If you peruse the Sunni books of hadith, you will find variant wordings for the tashahhud. As for the Sunni reports that narrate some of the wording of the Zaidi tashahhud: The wording "Bimillah wa Billahi" on the authority of Jabir (ra) appears in Sunan an-Nisa`i and Al-Mustadrak. Imam Hakim authenticated the report. There is another wording that says: "Bismillahi wa khayr al-Asmaa." This is narrated from Umar in Al-Mustadrak and Al-Hakim said that it is authentic according to the criteria of Muslim. It also appears in the Sunan of al-Bayhaqi. There is also "Bismillah wa Billahi wa khayr al-Asmaa" narrated from Ibn Zubayr in the Mu'jam al-Kabeer and al-Mu'jam al-Aswat of at-Tabaraani.&lt;/ref&gt;(Or alternatively: At-tahiyyātu lillāhi was-šalawāt waŧ-ŧayyibātu.) Ashhadu an lā ilāha ila Allāhu wahdahu lā sharīka lahu wa ashhadu anna Muhammadan abduhu wa rasūluhu. Allāhumma salli ‘ala Muhammad wa āli Muhammad. Wa bārik ‘ala Muhammad wa āli Muhammad. Ka mā salayta wa bārakta ‘ala Ibrāhīm wa ‘ala āli Ibrāhīm. Innaka Hamīdun Majīd}}

== Quranism ==
The minority [[Quranist|Quranist sect]] reject the practice of Tashahhud as an [[Bid'ah|innovation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.quran-islam.org/main_topics/islam/pillars/al-salat/salat_innovations_(P1206).html |title=True Islam - Salat Innovations |website=True Islam - Salat Innovations |access-date=2017-11-14 |quote=Reciting a prayer (called "At-Tahiyaat" or "Tashahud") during the Salat to commemorate Prophets Muhammad and Abraham and their families and friends! The Quran commands believers to dedicate their Salat and all worship practices to the name of God alone (6:162, 20:14). To praise or commemorate any other name during the Salat immediately invalidates the Salat and turns it into an act of shirk. Reciting a corrupt Shahada during Salat: God gave us the correct Shahada (Testimony) in the Quran (3:18). The Quranic Shahada is the one uttered by God Himself, the angels and all those endowed with knowledge. The corrupt innovation of adding the name of Muhammad to the Shahada is once again, an act of shirk. This corrupt Shahada is uttered during the Salat when the Quranic Shahada should be recited instead. |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170311082506/http://www.quran-islam.org/main_topics/islam/pillars/al-salat/salat_innovations_(P1206).html |archivedate=2017-03-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5417">'''Theodora of Emesa''' was a member of an intellectual group of Neoplatonists in late fifth and early sixth century Alexandria, and a disciple of [[Isidore of Alexandria|Isidore]]. [[Damascius]] dedicated his ''Life of Isidore'', also known as the ''Philosophical History'', to Theodora, having written it at her request.&lt;ref&gt;Photius, ''Bibliotheca Codex'' 181&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

The daughter of Kyrina and Diogenes, Theodora was, like [[Iamblichus]], descended from royal line of [[Royal Family of Emesa|Emesa]].

The Athenian Neoplatonic school had developed a following among Syrian and Egyptian pagan students at the turn of the fifth century,&lt;ref&gt;Edward Watts, ''Where to Live the Philosophical Life in the Sixth Century? Damascius, Simplicius, and the Return from Persia'' in the ''Journal of Greek, Roman and Byzantine Studies'' 45 (2005), p289&lt;/ref&gt; and Theodora, along with her younger sisters, had studied philosophy at the school of Isidore in Alexandria. This could have been in the 480s when Isidore was already well established within the intellectual Alexandrian millieu, or in the 490s after his return from Athens. She was also accomplished at poetics and grammar, a mathematician versed in geometry and higher arithmetic.&lt;ref&gt;[[Maria Dzielska]], ''Learned Women in the Alexandrian Scholarship'' in ''What Happened to the Ancient Library of Alexandria?'', ed. Mostafa el-Abaddi and Omnia Mounir Fathallah (Brill, Leiden) 2008, p146&lt;/ref&gt;

She was a Neoplatonist of the Iamblichean type, so a devout [[pagan]]. According to [[Photius]], writing three centuries later, she performed pagan rites and [[Theurgy|theurgical]] operations: he describes her as a ‘Hellene by religious persuasion,’ and her ancestors as ‘all of them first prize winners in idolatrous impropriety.’ &lt;ref&gt;[[Maria Dzielska]], ''Learned Women in the Alexandrian Scholarship'', in ''What Happened to the Ancient Library of Alexandria?'', ed. Mostafa el-Abaddi and Omnia Mounir Fathallah (Brill, Leiden) 2008, p146, footnote&lt;/ref&gt;

Damascius’s ''Life of Isidore'' illustrates the ease with which the philosophical circle to which Theodora belonged moved in the late fifth and early sixth centuries between Athens, Alexandria and Aphrodisias.&lt;ref&gt;Polymnia Athanadassi, ''Persecution and Response in Late Paganism: The Evidence of Damascius'', in the ''Journal of Hellenic Studies'' Vol. 113 (1993), p2&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no record of Theodora fleeing to Persia after [[Justinian I|Justinian]]’s order to close the Platonic school in Athens in 529, along with Isidore, Damascius, Simplicius, Priscianus Lydus, Eulamius of Phrygia, Hermias the Phoenician, and Diogenes the Phoenician.&lt;ref&gt;Cristina D’Ancona, Review of ''Damascius: the Philosophical History'', by P Athanadassi, in ''Mnemosyne'' Fourth Series, Vol. 55, Fasc. 2 (2002), p252&lt;/ref&gt;

==The ''Life of Isidore''==
Theodora was also taught by [[Damascius]], who was another disciple of Isidore and the last head of the Neoplatonic school in Athens.
It was at Theodora’s request that Damascius wrote the ''Life of Isidore'', and to her that he dedicated it. This work, also known as the ''Philosophical History'', was composed between 517-526, and provides an account of the lives and times of the pagan Neoplatonic communities in Alexandria and Athens at the very end of antiquity, structured around the biography of Isidore.

All that are left of its 60 chapters are excerpts, preserved in Photius’s ''[[Bibliotheca (Photius)|Bibliotheca]]'' and ''[[Suda]]'', which, generally regarded as the revised version of notes that he had made in the course of his reading over the previous 20 years, are not necessarily accurate transcripts.&lt;ref&gt;L. D. Reynolds and N. G. Wilson, ''Scribes and Scholars: A Guide to the Transmission of Greek and Latin Literature'', p55&lt;/ref&gt; Photius remarks that Damascius ‘does not so much write the life of Isidore, as that of many other people, both his contemporaries and his predecessors; he collects together their activities and also tales about them through a generous and even excessive use of digression’.&lt;ref&gt;trans. Polymnia Athanassiadi, ''Damascius: The Philosophical History'' (Athens: Apaea Cultural Association) 1999, p337&lt;/ref&gt;

Polymnia Athanadassi describes the work as ‘a critical, often humorous, appreciation of the character and achievement of individual men and women… Set firmly against a wide geographical, historical and political background, these people are shown to move in two disparate and often clashing worlds, those of paganism and Christianity.’&lt;ref&gt;Polymnia Athanadassi, ''Persecution and Response in Late Paganism: The Evidence of Damascius'', in the ''Journal of Hellenic Studies'' Vol. 113 (1993), p3&lt;/ref&gt;  But Edward Watts claims that ‘Ancient philosophical culture was not defined exclusively by religious concerns and doctrinal ties… Platonists shaped themselves into an intellectual community held together by doctrinal commonalities, a shared history, and defined personal relationships.’&lt;ref&gt;Edward Watts, ''Doctrine, Anecdote, and Action: Reconsidering the Social History of the Last Platonists (c. 430 – c. 550 C.E.)'', in ''Classical Philology'' Vol. 106, No. 3 (July 2011), p226&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Who's in the House'''" was a [[novelty song]] and hit single by [[Brendan O'Connor (media personality)|Fr. Brian and the Fun Lovin' Cardinals]]. It reached number three in the [[Irish Singles Chart]], and spent 12 weeks in the top 40 in 2000.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}

The song came from [[Brendan O'Connor (media personality)|Brendan O'Connor]]'s satirical character "Fr. Brian" on ''[[Don't Feed the Gondolas]]'' (a comedy game show shown on [[RTÉ]] in the late 90s). A rap style song, it parodies the [[Catholic Church]]'s attempts to be "cool" and "down with the kids" and contains the immortal chorus: ''"Who's in the House? [[Jesus]] in the House"''.

'''Xing Yi Quan''' ({{zh| c = 形意拳 | p = Xíng Yì Quán | w = Hsing I Ch'üan}}) is classified as one of the [[Wudang chuan|Wudang]] styles of [[Chinese martial arts]].&lt;ref name="Sun Lu Tang 2000 3"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sun Lu Tang|title=Xing Yi Quan Xue|year=2000|page=3|publisher=Unique Publications|isbn=0-86568-185-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name of the art translates approximately to "Form-Intention Fist", or "Shape-Will Fist".&lt;ref&gt;The name is pronounced 'Sheeng E Chwen?' in English (the word Quan has a tone that sounds like one is asking a question)&lt;/ref&gt;

Xing Yi is characterized by aggressive, seemingly linear movements and explosive power that's most often applied from a short range. A practitioner of Xing Yi uses coordinated movements to generate bursts of power intended to overwhelm the opponent, simultaneously attacking and defending. Methods vary from school to school, but always include bare-handed fighting training (mostly in single movements/combinations and sometimes in forms) and the training of weapons usage with similar or identical body mechanics to that used for bare-handed fighting. The most basic notions of movement and body mechanics in the art were heavily influenced by the practice of staffs and spears.
Historically and technically related martial arts include [[Dai Xin Yi Liu He Quan]], [[Liu He Xin Yi Quan]] and [[Yiquan|Yi Quan]].

==Origins==

===Legends===
[[File:Four Generals of Song.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The "Four Generals of Zhongxing" painted by ''Liu Songnian'' during the [[Southern Song Dynasty]]. [[Yue Fei]] is the second person from the left. This portrait is believed to be the "truest portrait of Yue in all extant materials."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = Shao Xiaoyi | title= Yue Fei's facelift sparks debate | url= http://zjxz.gov.cn/gb/node2/node138665/node139012/node139015/userobject15ai2978830.html | publisher = China Daily | accessdate=2007-08-09 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070929194758/http://zjxz.gov.cn/gb/node2/node138665/node139012/node139015/userobject15ai2978830.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-09-29|language=zh}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The earliest written records of Xing Yi can be traced to the 18th century, and are attributed to Ma Xueli of [[Henan Province]] and Dai Long Bang of [[Shanxi Province]]. Legend credits the creation of Xing Yi to renowned [[Song Dynasty]] (960-1279 AD) general [[Yue Fei]],&lt;ref name="kennedy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ejmas.com/jalt/jaltart_kennedy_1001.htm|title=InYo: hsingi training: Kennedy|website=Ejmas.com|accessdate=2016-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this is disputed.&lt;ref name="Zhang Fang" /&gt;

According to the book ''Henan Orthodox Xingyi Quan'' written by Pei Xirong ({{zh|裴錫榮}}) and Li Ying’ang ({{zh|李英昂}}), [[Xingyiquan|Xing Yi]] Dai Long Bang"''...wrote the Preface to Six Harmonies Boxing in the 15th reign year of the [[Qianlong Emperor]] [1750]. Inside it says, '...when [[Yue Fei]] was a child, he received special instructions from [[Zhou Tong (archer)|Zhou Tong]]. Extremely skilled in spearfighting, he used the spear to create fist techniques and established a skill called Yi Quan'' (意拳).'' Meticulous and unfathomable, this technique far outstripped ancient ones."

According to legend, throughout the [[Jin Dynasty, 1115–1234|Jin]], [[Yuan Dynasty|Yuan]] and [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] Dynasties few individuals had studied this art, one of them being ''Ji Gong'' (also known as [[Ji Longfeng]] and [[Ji Jike]]) of [[Shanxi Province]]. After Yue Fei's death, the art was 'lost' for half a millennium. Then, during the Ming and [[Qing]] Dynasties in [[Shaanxi Province]]'s Zhongnan Mountains, Yue Fei's boxing manual was said to have been discovered by Ji Gong. It is more likely though that Ji Jike had created the art based on prior martial arts experience, or passed on an art that had already existed.
{{Chinese martial arts}}

===General history (ancient times - 20th century)===
Yang Jwing-Ming (who is not a practitioner of the art) argues that aspects of Xing Yi Quan (particularly the animal styles) are identifiable as far back as the [[Liang Dynasty]] at the Shaolin Temple.&lt;ref name=Yang&gt;{{cite book | author=Yang,, Jwing-Ming &amp; Liang Shou-Yu | title=Xingyiquan : Theory, Applications, Fighting Tactics and Spirit | publisher=YMAA Pubn | year=2003 | isbn=0-940871-41-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Jwing-Ming, [[Yue Fei]] therefore did not strictly invent Xing Yi Quan, but synthesized and perfected existing Shaolin principles into his own style of gongfu which he popularized during his military service. Nonetheless, according to Jwing-Ming, Yue Fei is usually identified as the creator because of his considerable understanding of the art (as shown in the work ''The Ten Theses of Xingyiquan'', credited to Yue) and his cultural status as a Chinese war hero. It ought be noted that in Chinese culture, it is common to attribute the creation of great traditions to legendary individuals. In such a way, the art of [[Tai Ji Quan]] is attributed to the legendary Zhang Sanfeng, and [[Daoism]] to [[Laozi]], even though as in the case with Yue Fei, there exists no proof for such claim.

Other martial artists and [[Chinese martial art]] historians, such as Dan Miller, [[Tim Cartmell|Cartmell]], and Brian Kennedy, hold that this story is largely legendary; while Xing Yi Quan may well have evolved from military spear techniques, there is no evidence to support that Yue Fei was involved or that the art dates to the Song dynasty. These authors point out that the works attributed to Yue Fei's role long postdate his life, some being as recent as the [[Republican China|Republican]] era, and that it was common practice in China to attribute new works to a famous or legendary person, rather than take credit for oneself.&lt;ref name=Kennedy&gt;{{cite book | last = Kennedy | first = Brian |author2=Elizabeth Guo  | year = 2005 | title = Chinese Martial Arts Training Manuals: A Historical Survey | publisher = North Atlantic Books | location = Berkeley, California | isbn = 1-55643-557-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Miller&gt;{{cite book | last = Miller | first = Dan |author2=Tim Cartmell  | year = 1999 | title = Xing Yi Nei Gong | publisher = Unique Publications | location = Burbank, California | isbn = 0-86568-174-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; One source claims that the author of the "preface" is unknown, since no name is written on the manuscript. Most practitioners just assume it was written by Dai Long Bang. Some researchers of [[martial arts]] believe that it was actually written in [[Shanxi]] during the final years of the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = Jarek Szymanski | title= Dai Family Xinyiquan - The Origins and Development | url=http://www.chinafrominside.com/ma/xyxy/daihistory.html | publisher = China From Inside | accessdate=2007-08-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, historical memoirs and scholarly research papers only mention [[Zhou Tong (archer)|Zhou Tong]] teaching Yue archery and not spear play.&lt;ref&gt;Toktoghan (脱脱).

''Yueh Fei and the founding of the Southern Sung''. Thesis (Ph. D.) -- University of Iowa, 1970. Ann Arbor: University Microfilms International, 1970., pg. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; Yue historically learned spear play from Chen Guang (陳廣), who was hired by the boy’s paternal grandfather, Yao Daweng (姚大翁).&lt;ref&gt;Yue, Ke (岳柯). ''Jin Tuo Xu Pian'' (金佗續編), 1234 - Chapter 28, pg. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan: pg. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in the late Ming era and [[Ji Jike|Ji Longfeng]]'s time, evidence for the art's history grows firmer. Ji Longfeng, also known as Ji Jike, is the first person which all agree had both existed and practiced the art. Ji Longfeng's contributions to the art are described in the ''Ji Clan Chronicles'' (姬氏族譜; [[pinyin]]: Ji Shi Jiapu). Like the ''Preface'', the ''Chronicles'' describes Xing Yi Quan as a martial art based on the combat principles of the spear. The ''Chronicles'', however, attributes this stylistic influence to Ji himself, who was known as the "Divine Spear" (神槍; [[pinyin]]: Shén Qiāng) for his extraordinary skill with the weapon. Nowadays, many believe that the style Ji Longfeng was taught had been [[Shaolin Xin Yi Ba]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://benotdefeatedbytherain.blogspot.co.il/2013/09/xinyi-quan-and-xingyi-quan.html|title=Be not Defeated by the Rain: Xinyi Quan 心意拳 and Xingyi Quan 形意拳|website=Benotdefeatedbytherain.blogspot.co.il|accessdate=2016-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; (a style which still exists today, and bears minute resemblance to XinYi LiuHe Quan). Ji Longfeng referred to his art as Liu He, The Six Harmonies, a reference to the most highly developed spear style practiced in the late Ming military.

Some speculate that during that period in the development of the art, either Ji Longfeng or some of his students had a connection with monks at the famous [[Shaolin Temple]] on [[Song Mountain]]. There exists a martial art called 'Xin Yi Ba', which is still taught at the general location of the temple, and bears a few similarities to Xing Yi related styles. Some claim that [[Shaolin Xin Yi Ba]] had been taught to the Shaolin monks by Ji Longfeng's line, while others hold the view that Ji Longfeng was taught martial arts by the monks.

From Ji Longfeng, the art was passed down to [[Cao Jiwu]]. From Cao Jiwu, the art split into its two biggest branches. One branch came down from Cao's student Ma Xueli,&lt;ref&gt;Some historians believe Ma Xueli was taught by Ji Longfeng himself. However, the traditions of the Ma family itself say only that Xueli learned from a wandering master whose name is unknown.&lt;/ref&gt; and became Xin Yi Liu He Quan - an art still widely practiced today, which compared to other lineages, have not undergone many changes over the generations.&lt;ref&gt;Ma Xueli was of the Chinese Muslim Hui minority, and to this day, most of the practitioners of this art are of that minority&lt;/ref&gt; The other branch that came down from Cao Jiwu was through his other student, Dai Longbang.&lt;ref&gt;The ''Preface'' identifies Cao Ji Wu as a student of Ji Longfeng and the master who taught Xing Yi Quan to Dai Long Bang. However, other sources identify Dai's teacher variously as Li Zheng or Niu Xixian.&lt;/ref&gt; The latter passed the art into the Dai clan, which had made many changes to it, mixing it with several arts and skills that had already existed in the Dai family. The art remains in the Dai clan to this day, but has also spread elsewhere in China and around the world.

The art remained fairly obscure until [[Li Luoneng]] (also known as Li Nengran) learned the art from the Dai family in the 19th century. It was [[Li Luoneng]] and his successors — which include [[Guo Yunshen]], [[Song Shirong]], [[Che Yizhai]], [[Liu Qilan]] and [[Li Taihe]] (who would popularize Xing Yi Quan across Northern [[China]]).

It is known that [[Li Luoneng]] was proficient in other martial arts before studying Dai clan's Xin Yi. Some claim his original art was ''Qimen Quan (奇門拳)'', perhaps his family's style, while others believe he actually studied [[Tongbei Quan]] and [[Gongli Quan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smilingtiger.net/Laonong.html|title=Li Laonong|website=Smilingtiger.net|accessdate=2016-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Li came to study under the Dai family either because he heard of their fame in the martial arts and business, or maybe as suggested by others, after having fought and lost to a practitioner of their art. It is generally agreed he then settled in the area of their village, and grew and sold vegetables, which earned him the nickname 'Li Lao Nong' 李老農 (Old Farmer Li, but also 'Respectable Farmer Li'). Initially, members of the Dai clan refused to teach him, but he eventually won over their trust, and he was taught by Dai Wenxiong, Guo Weihan, or both. After learning Dai Xin Yi for a number of years, perhaps over a decade, Li left the Dai territories and traveled across Shanxi and Hebei provinces, teaching for many years his own elaboration on the art, now called 'Xing Yi Quan'. No reasons were ever recorded for the many changes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cookdingskitchen.blogspot.co.il/2015/10/the-history-of-xingyiquan-and-yiquan.html|title=Cook Ding's Kitchen: The History of Xingyiquan and Yiquan|website=Cookdingskitchen.blogspot.co.il|accessdate=2016-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Li made to the art, but there are those who claim that Li wished to compete with the Dai clan's fame, perhaps because of some grudge. Li and many of his students and grand-students were famous for offering bodyguard and caravan escort services.

===Recent history (20th and 21st centuries)===
A condensed version of Xing Yi Quan was taught to Chinese officers at the Military Academy at Nanjing during the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] for [[Close combat|close quarters combat]]. This included armed techniques such as bayonet and sabre drills alongside unarmed techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Rovere | first = Dennis | year = 2008 | title = The Xingyi Quan of the Chinese Army: Huang Bo Nien's Xingyi Fist and Weapon Instruction | publisher = Blue Snake Books | location = Berkeley, California | isbn = 978-1-58394-257-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sun Lutang]], a later exponent of the art, became famous in the early 20th century for his skills (chiefly in the [[Beijing]] and [[Tianjin]] areas), and for the martial books he had written about the [[Neijia|Internal]] arts. During Sun Lutang's lifetime and martial 'career', he and several of his contemporaries began to classify Xing Yi, together with [[Taijiquan|Taiji Quan]] and [[Baguazhang|Bagua Zhang]], as '[[Wudang chuan|Wudang Martial Arts]]' style.&lt;ref name="Sun Lu Tang 2000 3"/&gt; Sun also exchanged knowledge with his friend and colleague [[Fu Chen Sung|Fu Zhensong]], who subsequently took this branch of the art to southern [[China]] (after it had been mostly practiced in the northern parts of the country for centuries). Later, many others have spread the art across China and the world. [[Yiquan|Yi Quan]], which had been evolved from Xing Yi Quan by Wang Xiangzhai, became especially widespread during the 20th century, in China and across the world.

Following the [[Cultural Revolution]] in China, some Xing Yi forms have been adapted to fit the needs of modern practitioners of the competitive sport of [[Wushu (sport)|Wushu]]. This meant that various movement forms from the art were adapted to a competitive format, in which the emphasis was put on aesthetics and flowery movements, rather than on fighting. The style is nonetheless relatively rare in wushu competitions because all wushu practitioners must compete in several mandatory events, which make Xing Yi, a non-mandatory art, a secondary priority in wushu competitive circles.

As there had never been a single organizational body governing the teaching of the art, several variant styles and sub-styles developed. Although there are [[Xingyiquan#The Xing Yi Classics - Important texts in the art|classical texts]] which include specific encoded instructions and general guidelines for practice, many of these are ignored by most modern practitioners, and interpreted in different ways by those who follow their instruction (this is depicted in the [[Xing Yi Quan#Lineage chart|lineage chart]] further down this page). As a result, over the decades and especially over the last few dozen years, branches of the art have considerably differentiated and diverged. This trend was strengthened by [[Xing Yi Quan#Cross influences with other martial arts|cross influences various Xing Yi teachers had from other martial arts and martial artists]], and the spread of Xing Yi to the [[Western World]].

The art began to be taught in the West somewhere along the 1960s-1970s. However, it only rose to prominence among martial arts communities worldwide during the first decade of the 21st century. Currently, it is still not well known among the general public. One explanation for this situation is that unlike other traditional oriental martial arts, Xing Yi was not a notable style in movies which became popular in the West (and though a modified 'wushu' version of it appeared in [[The One (2001 film)|The One]], starring Jet Li, this was not told or hinted to the viewers as part of that film's script).

Arguably, the most common Xing Yi Quan lineage in the West today is of the Yi Zong branch,&lt;ref name="luo dexiu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yizong.org/uk/nei-jia-quan.htm#xingyiquan|title=Yizong school 易宗八卦門 Luo Dexiu - Nei Jia Quan - Bagua, Hsing Yi, Tai Chi, Chi Gong, Internal Martial Arts|website=Yizong.org|accessdate=2016-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; which came down from [[Zhang Junfeng]]. Many of Zhang's students and grand-students, such as [[Kenneth Fish (martial artist)]], [[Hung I-Hsiang]], [[Su Dongchen]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.essenceofevolution.com/16su%20rireki.htm|title=Resume|website=Essenceofevolution.com|accessdate=2016-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Luo Dexiu]], [[Hsu Hung-Chi|Xu Hongji]] and others have been teaching his Xing Yi to Westerners since the 1980s - especially Americans. This branch became the most popular because Taiwan was open to Westerners during the 20th century, while throughout much of that century, the Communist regime on mainland China did not allow Westerners to visit regularly, and thus people were not exposed to branches of the art from the mainland. Contrary to popular belief, spread by some Taiwanese teachers, the art had not 'died out' on the mainland, but was simply inaccessible to outsiders for several decades (proof of this is that many lineages of the art discussed and referenced on this page had survived [[The Great Leap Forward]] and The Cultural Revolution). Another popular Taiwanese branch in the West is [[Wang Shujin]]'s lineage, which was chiefly transmitted by his student Wang Fulai.

There are also several lineages from [[Tianjin]] which are nowadays taught in the West, namely in [[Canada]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://internalstyle.com/martial-art/xing-yi|title=Xing Yi - Master Yang's Internal Training System|author=Super User|website=Internalstyle.com|accessdate=2016-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Israel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://internalarts.weebly.com|title=Shang Wu Zhai שאנג וו ג'אי - ביס לאמנויות לחימה|work=Shang Wu Zhai שאנג וו ג'אי - ביס לאמנויות לחימה}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lines of Dai XinYi and XinYi LiuHe are still rare in the West, and can be said to even be relatively rare in China, though they are not at risk of becoming 'extinct'. In the United States, Dai XinYi is taught by [[Li Tailiang]] and several of his students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/site/xinyidaousa/Home/master-li-tai-liang |title=Archived copy |accessdate=May 21, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081016110552/http://sites.google.com/site/xinyidaousa/Home/master-li-tai-liang |archivedate=October 16, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Yi Quan, on the other hand, has become exceedingly popular in the West, being taught in many schools, especially in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yiquan.info/|title=Yiquan Academy International Network|author=Andrzej Kalisz|website=Yiquan.info|accessdate=2016-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are no statistics as to the number of practitioners in any of these arts in either China or other countries.

===Disputed history===
Ancient Chinese texts, like those which make up the 'Xing Yi Classics', often contain characters whose meanings are obscure or have disappeared completely from the Chinese language. Specialized terms which describe historically specific concepts (names of ancient weapons for example) are commonly interpreted with regards for their closest, modern linguistic equivalent. The results can be problematic, producing translations which are linguistically correct but inconsistent within a fighting or martial context.

The recognized founder of [[Bagua Zhang]], [[Dong Hai Chuan]], was reputed to have fought [[Guo Yunshen]] with neither able to defeat the other - though it is possible that they were training together. It would have been controversial at the time for Dong Hai Chuan to have studied under [[Guo Yunshen]], since Dong was the older of the two. The most neutral viewpoint would be to say that they trained ''together'', which may explain the stylistic similarities between Bagua Zhang and the Xing Yi Quan monkey shape. [[Bruce Kumar Frantzis|Frantzis]]&lt;ref name=Frantzis&gt;{{cite book | author=Frantzis, Bruce Kumar | title=The Power of Internal Martial Arts | location=Berkeley, CA | publisher=North Atlantic Books|year=1998|isbn=1-55643-253-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; argues that this encounter never took place and that Guo and Dong had little contact with each other. Frantzis argues that a Xing Yi - Bagua exchange was more likely to have occurred in [[Tianjin]] c. 1900 where xingyi masters Li Cunyi and Zhang Zhaodong, Bagua master Cheng Tinghua, and four other xingyi and bagua teachers lived together (Frantzis, 1998, p.&amp;nbsp;179).
Sun Lutang states in his autobiography that the legendary fight between [[Guo Yunshen]] and Dong Hai Chuan never happened.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Sun Lu Tang (tran, Albert Liu) | title=Xing Yi Quan Xue: The Study of Form-Mind Boxing | publisher=Unique Publications | year=2000 | isbn=0-86568-185-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book states that the truth of the matter is that [[Guo Yunshen]] actually fought one of his older xingyi brothers and lost. Sun Lutang was a student of both [[Guo Yunshen]] and Cheng Tinghua so this stance on the subject seems to be one of the most accurate.
Treating the story of Dong Hai Chuan and Guo Yunshen as allegory, however, reveals a common training protocol among Xing Yi Quan and Bagua Zhang practitioners. Often, because Bagua Zhang requires significantly more time for a practitioner's skill to mature, it is acceptable to learn Xing Yi Quan first or simultaneously. Such a practitioner develops a tactical vocabulary that is more readily apparent than the core Bagua Zhang movements.

==Branches of Xing Yi Quan==
From Cao Jiwu, the art split into two branches:
* Ma family's Xin Yi Liu He Quan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinafrominside.com/ma/xyxy/xylhhistory.html|title=ChinaFromInside.com presents...  XINYI &amp; XINGYI - Xinyi Liuhe Quan|website=Chinafrominside.com|accessdate=2016-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Dai family's Liu He Xin Yi Quan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinafrominside.com/ma/xyxy/daihistory.html|title=ChinaFromInside.com presents...  XINYI &amp; XINGYI -Dai Family Xinyiquan - The Origins and Development|website=Chinafrominside.com|accessdate=2016-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These two branches survive to this day. Later, [[Li Luoneng]] developed Xing Yi Quan out of the Dai family branch. From [[Li Luoneng]]'s time onward, the art has been said to have three main developmental branches:
*Shanxi  (including the Song-family sub-branch)
*Hebei (Most commonly practiced Xing Yi Quan, and the branch [[Yiquan|Yi Quan]] evolved from).
*Henan (an alternative name for Ma family's Xin Yi Liu He Quan).

However, the identification of three separate branches is tenuous because of the extensive cross-training that occurred across their lineages. This suggests that the branches did not evolve in isolation, thus diluting any major differences between them.

Year 2004. The student being demonstrated upon is late master Yang's disciple, Sudan Jeffers.]]

Schools of the Shanxi branch have a narrower stance, lighter footwork and tend to be more evasive. They emphasize the development of relaxation before the practice of intention (Yi). Schools of the [[Hebei]] branch emphasize Xing and Yi before developing a higher level of relaxed structure, and have a slightly different evasive footwork. Schools of the [[Henan]] branch are typically the most aggressive of the three.

The [[Henan]] branch is known as the [[Muslim]] branch because it was handed down within the [[Muslim]] community in [[Luoyang]] to which its founder, Ma Xueli, belonged. Henan branch is sometimes referred to by practitioners as XinYi LiuHe Quan instead of simply Xing Yi Quan. This may be attributed to the fact that the Muslim community of [[China]] was historically a very closed culture in order to protect themselves as a minority, thus retaining the older addition to the name of Xingyi. Liuhe means "Six Harmonies" and refers to the six harmonies of the body (three external harmonies: wrists-ankles, elbows-knees, shoulders-hips; three internal harmonies: xin-yi, yi-qi, qi-li i.e. spirit or "emotional mind" (xin) harmonises with your intention (yi), intention harmonises with your breath and physical momentum (qi), breath and physical momentum harmonise with your physical strength (li) that contribute to correct posture.) This is not to be confused with the separate internal art [[Liuhebafa]].

Both the Shanxi and [[Hebei]] branches use a twelve animal system with five elements while the [[Henan]] branch uses ten animals. Depending on the lineage, it may or may not use five elements. Due to the historical complexity and vagueness of the lineages, it is uncertain which branch would constitute the "authentic" Xing Yi Quan.

In all of the following sections under this paragraph is chiefly discussed the art of Xing Yi Quan that had come down from Li Luoneng. These sections are not representative of Dai XinYi Quan or [[Liu He Xin Yi Quan|LiuHe XinYi Quan]].

==Characteristics and principles==

Xing Yi Quan features aggressive shocking attacks and direct footwork. Most of the training and footwork are practiced on straight lines. The linear nature of the art hints at both the military origins and the influence of spear technique alluded to in its mythology. The goal of the Xing Yi exponent is to reach the opponent quickly and drive power through them in a single burst. The analogy with spear fighting is useful here. This is achieved by coordinating one's body as a single unit, and the intense focusing of one's Intent (Yi 意) and coordinated power (Jin 勁) utilizing tight circles (usually in a forward direction). Issuing explosive power in Xing Yi is referred to as 'Fa Jin' (發勁), the same term used in many other traditional [[Chinese Martial Arts]].

Despite its hard, angular appearance, cultivating [[Hard and soft (martial arts)|"soft"]] [[neijin|internal strength]] is essential to achieving power in Xing Yi Quan. Also, the advanced practitioner always contains tight spirals within his movements, so even the seemingly direct and linear ones are circular on a very small scale. Such circles and spirals also exist in other martial arts, but Xing Yi (like [[Southern Praying Mantis (martial art)|Southern Praying Mantis]]) likes to keep them smaller than others.

Efficiency and economy of movement are the qualities of a Xing Yi stylist, and its direct fighting philosophy advocates simultaneous attack and defense. There are few kicks except for extremely low foot kicks (which avoids the hazards of balance involved with higher kicks) and some mid-level kicks, and techniques are prized for their working within key principles rather than aesthetic value.

Xing Yi Quan favours a fighting stance called Sān Tǐ Shì (三體勢 / 三体势),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ymaa.com/articles/fundamental-moving-patterns-of-xingyiquan|title=Fundamental Moving Patterns of Xingyiquan|website=Ymaa.com|accessdate=2016-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3iefvePUf8|title=Xing Yi Quan: SAN TI SHI|first=|last=Freedom Martial Art|date=12 March 2008|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; literally "three bodies power," referring to how the stance holds the head, torso and feet along the same vertical plane (As a Zhan Zhuang method, this stance is trained lower). Though usually held shorter and higher in actual fighting, in training San Ti is more often trained at middle-low heights.

Like other [[Neijia|Internal Arts]], much of the training in Xing Yi Quan is done in slow-motion. This is true for almost all the movements in the art, though the majority of them can and are also trained explosively.

==Overview of the art and its training methods==

===Zhan Zhuang (站樁)===
This is a general name given to postures which one holds in place for prolonged periods of time - anywhere between 2 minutes and 2 hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smilingtiger.net/pangen.html|title=Pangen|website=Smilingtiger.net|accessdate=2016-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; These postures are related to postures used in actual fighting, and are sometimes identical to them. Initially, these postures are taught as static training stances. After a short amount of time though, the practitioner would be taught how to move the muscles and connective tissues on a minute level from the inside of the body, making these stances very dynamic internally and more challenging to train. The most common Zhan Zhuang among all Xing Yi schools is San Ti Shi (it is the stance demonstrated by Sun Lutang in the picture at the beginning of the article). Other common stances are:  Hun Yuan Zhuang, Wu Ji Zhuang, Fu Hu Zhuang, Xiang Long Zhuang and their many variants. There are many reasons for training Zhan Zhuang. Among them are, in general:
[[File:Nitzan Oren practicing Zhan Zhuang.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Shifu Nitzan Oren, demonstrating a Zhan Zhuang posture which combines the San Ti stance and a Hun Yuan hand variation]]
- It is the simplest method to work on the training of one's Intent (Yi).

- They are used to develop one's martial structure.

- One can learn the bodily alignments of the art and perfect them in a more relaxed state.

- Correct breathing can be trained more methodically while holding Zhan Zhuang.

- There are certain health benefits involved in such training.

Some teachers consider Zhan Zhuang to be the most important practice in Xing Yi; whereas, others neglect to train and teach them altogether. The use of the Santi Shi (三體勢) Zhan Zhuang as the main training method in Xing Yi dates back to Li Luoneng, the founder of modern version of the art. In Dai XinYi, the central and most important training method is called 'Squatting Monkey' - a dynamic movement exercise rather than a static posture held in place. In the Geng Jishan/Deng Yunfeng/Rose Li tradition, the phrase Santi is sometimes replaced by "central equilibrium stance".

Since the 1980s, Zhan Zhuang has become more and more popular in other martial arts; many of which, such as some schools of Chen style Taiji, borrowed these methods from Xing Yi schools. Other martial arts sometimes had their own Zhan Zhuang methods beforehand. Today, the posture Hun Yuan Zhuang in particular has become a mainstay of many styles; its spread probably owing to the growing popularity of Yi Quan.

===Plow Stepping===
Also called 'Friction Stepping' (Mo Ca Bu; 摩擦步), This exercise is meant to ingrain in the practitioner the correct forward-stepping habits and methods of Xing Yi, which are different from those of other arts (though similar to those found in some styles of Bagua Zhang). Plow stepping is a precursor to Xing Yi's 'Chicken Stepping', which is the faster and more explosive stepping method in the art. In Yi Quan, Plow Stepping had been replaced with 'Mud Stepping'.

===Shi Li (試力) / Mo Jin===
In many lineages, there is an intermittent stage between the stationary Zhan Zhuang and the more complex Five Elements (though this stage might also be taught following the Five Elements). The two names above are interchangeable for a few exercises developed to fulfill that purpose. Shi Li movements are basically simplified versions of the more advanced body mechanics and circles found in the Five Elements and the Animals. Their focus is on training one's structure and Yi, and can be thought of as 'Zhan Zhuang in movement'. They are usually trained very slowly, one movement at a time, repeating the same movement for many minutes on end. The more advanced practitioner many also spontaneously link up and flow between different Shi Li movements, or train them more explosively with Fa Jin (发劲). In Yi Quan, the original Five Elements and 12 Animals have all been 'condensed' and 'refined' into forms of Shi Li, which replace them as the core exercises in the art (together with Zhan Zhuang).

There also exists in certain lineages a type of Shi Li drill called Si Bu Pan Gen. It originated from Bagua Zhang, and is a form of tight Circle Walking - encircling a small square rather than a circle. The main purposes of it is to train evasive stepping and stretch the hip and groin regions (the Kua).

===Five Element Shapes (Wǔ Xíng 五行)===
Xing Yi uses movements called [[Five elements (Chinese)|the five classical Chinese elements]] to metaphorically represent five different states of combat.&lt;ref name="luo dexiu"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinafrominside.com/ma/xyxy/dongxiusheng.html|title=ChinaFromInside.com presents...  XINYI &amp; XINGYI - Five Elements Essentials of Yue's Intention Boxing|website=Chinafrominside.com|accessdate=2016-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also called the "Five Fists" or "Five Phases," the Five Elements are related to [[Taoist]] [[cosmology]] although the names do not literally correspond to the cosmological terms. These five movements make the 'base' of the art,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://taiji-europa.eu/other-chinese-internal-arts/basics-of-xingyiquan/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=April 3, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140319213844/http://taiji-europa.eu/other-chinese-internal-arts/basics-of-xingyiquan/ |archivedate=March 19, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; upon which all further combative knowledge and skill is built upon. Most schools will teach the five elements before the twelve animals because they are easier and shorter to learn (though eventually more difficult to master). The Five Elements do not appear in Henan XinYi LiuHe Quan, though similar movements and methods exist in that art's curriculum.

Each of the Five Element movements has many vectors of movement contained within it. Together, they are used to explore all the useful ways through which one could advance on a straight line. Each of the Elements may be used as a Zhan Zhuang in-itself, and in some schools this is encouraged.

A common saying originating from the Xing Yi classics is: "The hands do not leave the heart and the elbows do not leave the ribs".&lt;ref name=Miller/&gt; This is most evident in the Five Elements.

Some Xing Yi practitioners also use the five elements as an interpretative framework for reacting and responding to attacks. This follows the five element theory, a general combat formula which assumes two types of cyclic interactions and three types of adverse interactions. The two cyclic interactions are the mutual nourishment (constructive) and mutual restraint (destructive) cycles. The adverse reactions are lesser known and rarely trained but exist from the understanding that nothing would exist if the mutual nourishment and restraint cycles existed alone, the adverse reactions are mutual over-restraint (overwhelming destructive interaction), mutual reverse restraint (reversal of the destructive cycle), and mutual burdening (unbalancing or reversal of the constructive cycle). Practitioners abiding by these concepts train to react to and execute specific techniques in such a way that a desirable cycle will form based on these interactions of the five element theory. Where to aim, where to hit and with what technique—and how those motions should work defensively, is determined by what point of which cycle they see themselves in. Each of the elements has many variant applications that allow it to be used to defend against all of the elements (including itself), so any set sequences are ultimately entirely arbitrary in real combat but present a frame work for developing a more practical skill, the destructive cycle is often taught to 'beginners' as it is generally easier to visualize and consists of easier applications.

===Animal Shapes (Shí'èr Xíng 十二形)===
Xing Yi Quan is based on twelve distinct Animal Shapes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chiflow.com/Xingyiquan.htm|title=chiflow Nei Jia Kungfu Taiji, Xingyquan, Baguazhang Qigung and Liangong|website=Chiflow.com|accessdate=2016-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; (of which, ten animals are more common - see table below). Present in all regional and family styles, these animal movements emulate the techniques and tactics of the corresponding animal rather than just their physical movements. Many schools of Xing Yi Quan have only small number of movements for each animal, though some teach extended sequences of movements.

===Ba Zi Gong===
These are 8 fighting combinations that exist in some lineages of the art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smilingtiger.net/Ba%20Zi%201.pdf |format=PDF |title=Xingyi Quan Ba Zi Gong : Xingyi Quan Eight Characters Skills |author=Liu Xiaoling |website=Smilingtiger.net |accessdate=2016-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; They emphasize direct combat applicability, and elaborate further on the movements vectors and powers explored and trained with the Five Elements. Sometimes, there exist two variations for the Ba Zi Gong - one for gongfu development, and another for actual fighting usage. There might also exist in a lineage a linking form for all 8 combinations. The eight Ba Zi Gong are:  Zhǎn 斬 (Cutting Down/Severing), Jié 截 (Intercepting), Guǒ 裹 (Wrapping), Kuà 挎 (Carrying), Tiāo 挑 (Lifting/Raising), Dǐng 頂 (Pushing Upwards), Lìng 令 (Leading) and Yún 雲 (Cloud).

===Linking forms===
[[File:Zuan quan.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Master Di Guoyong of Beijing demonstrating a Zuan Quan application as part of a partner practice form (dui lian). Shot in Beijing, September 2014.]]
Additionally to the Five Fists and animal shapes, many lineages employ the training of several additional movement forms - from a handful to a few dozen.&lt;ref name="luo dexiu"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wudangdanpai.com/?page_id=18|title=Xingyiquan 形意拳 - International Wudang Internal Martial Arts Academy|website=Wudangdanpai.com|accessdate=2016-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the more common forms are partner forms, which simulate combat scenarios. Once the individual animal shapes are taught, a student is often taught an animal linking form (''shi'er xing lianhuan'') which connects all the taught animals together in a sequence. Some styles have longer, or multiple forms for individual animals, such Eight Tiger Forms ''Huxing bashi''. Other forms often link movements from the Five Fists, the different animal shapes, or both, and commonly include additional movements and techniques not found elsewhere. There also exist a Ba Zi Gong linking form and many weapons forms.

===Weapons===
Xing Yi Quan emphasizes a close relationship between the movements of armed/unarmed techniques. This technical overlap aims to produce greater learning efficiency.

Traditionally Xing Yi was an armed art. Students would train initially with the spear, progressing to shorter weapons and eventually empty-handed fighting. This gradually changed throughout the 20th century, as the emphasis in most traditional [[Chinese Martial Arts]] shifted from the use of weapons to fighting empty-handed. Weapon diversity is great in many lineages, with the idea being that an experienced Xing Yi fighter would be able to pick up almost any weapon available (or an object to use as such) irrespective of its exact length, weight and shape.

Common weapons in the art:

*[[Qiang (spear)|Spear]]. This is the most synonymous weapon with the art. Spears are usually 1.8–5 meters in length, though those over 3 meters long are meant solely for increasing training intensity and challenge, and historically people would not commonly fight with spears that large. The Five Fists of Xing Yi have variations which are trained with the spear.&lt;ref name=Miller/&gt;
*[[Jian|Chinese Straight sword]]
*[[Dao (sword)|Chinese Sabre]]

Less common weapons:

*[[Zhanmadao|Large Sabre]] (used by infantry against mounted opponents)
*Long [[Gun (staff)|Staff]]
*Short Staff (at maximum length you could hold between the palms of your hands at each end - techniques with this weapon may have been used with a spear that had been broken)
*Needles (much like a double ended [[Rondel (dagger)|rondel]] gripped in the centre - on the battlefield this would mostly have been used like its western equivalent to finish a fallen opponent through weak points in the armour)
*[[Halberd|Fuyue]] (halberds of various types)
*[[Chicken Sickles|Chicken-Sabre Sickle]]. This weapon was supposedly created by Ji Longfeng and became the special weapon of the style. Its alternate name is "Binding Flower Waist Carry".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Yang,, Jwing-Ming|title=Ancient Chinese Weapons: A Martial Artist’s Guide|location=Boston, MA|publisher=YMAA|year=1999|isbn=1-886969-67-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Xing Yi Classics===
[[File:Wu Mu Quan Pu.jpeg|thumb|''Wu Mu Quan Pu (武穆拳譜)''|right]]
A variety of Important texts have survived throughout the years, often called "Classics", "Songs" or "Theories". These texts use intentionally vague language to describe the principles and methods of practice in LiuHe XinYi Quan, Dai XinYi Quan and Xing Yi Quan. They are less relevant to more modern interpretations of these arts, such as Yi Quan. In the past, these text were copied by hand, and were kept secret.&lt;ref name="kennedy" /&gt;

The following is a list of the most commonly referred-to classical texts:

*Classic of Unification
*Classic of Fighting
*Classic of Stepping
*Classic of Six Harmonies

Much of these texts can be read in English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Joseph Crandall |url=http://www.smilingtiger.net/xingyi.htm |title=Xingyi |website=Smilingtiger.net |date= |accessdate=2016-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Below is a picture of one book containing the classics, which belongs to Li Bo (李博) from [[Shijiazhuang]], a teacher who claims to be a descendant of Li Luoneng, the founder of the art. This book is titled ''Wu Mu Quan Pu (武穆拳譜）''.

Generally speaking, it is accepted that in Xing Yi (at least in Hebei-derived lineages), there are three stages to a practitioner's development of power and overall skill.&lt;ref name="luo dexiu"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinafrominside.com/ma/xyxy/diguoyongBIS.html|title=ChinaFromInside.com presents...  XINYI &amp; XINGYI - BAGUAZHANG - Interview with Mr. Di Guoyong (Part 2)|website=Chinafrominside.com|accessdate=2016-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
These three stages develop and change in parallel to all other training methods, and dictate the quality of one's training methods. The following is a description of these three stages (a translation of classic texts&lt;ref name="HuangST"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smilingtiger.net/huangst.htm|title=HuangST|website=Smilingtiger.net|accessdate=2016-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liuhexinyi.com/yaoling.htm |title=É½Î÷Áùºïðäòâè |publisher=Liuhexinyi.com |date= |accessdate=2016-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hi.baidu.com/252765201/item/86575071466deb106dc37cd4|title=百度--您的訪問出錯了|website=Hi.baidu.com|accessdate=2016-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Devlin G. Horrinek):

*  Ming Jin 明勁 ('Clear-to-see Jin') - The strength and form must be strong, precise, and clear. Extend outward with force. When putting out force it must pass through, penetrate, pierce, connect, be pliant, ferocious, round, firm, have a shaking-cutting strength, and deliver explosive force. Practice and drill the hand techniques to develop the external 5-Elements and the elbows to develop the internal 5-Elements. Advancing and retreating with bent legs as if wading through mud (tang ni; refers to the practice and intent of Plow/Mud Stepping) like "walking while plowing through mud". This is the stage of Ming Jin.
*  An Jin 暗勁 ('Hidden Jin') - One must have already grasped and have a strong foundation in the Ming Jin stage. Then you can start on the second stage. Now when using strength you contain it and don't reveal it on the outside. Store up (xu) but don't emit (fa). Deliberately store up your Jin. The power to 'fa' emit is held back but not released, to the opponent this feels very powerful and strange and then you can emit. This is called "Treading on thin Ice" [And the feeling is like when walking on an iced-over lake and never knowing when, or if, you're going to break through the ice.]. This is the stage of An Jin.
*  Hua Jin 化勁 ('Transforming Jin') - This is considered the highest stage of practice. You must have already grasped the stages of Ming Jin and An Jin and have a very strong foundation in them. You should have a lot of experience in fighting as you must know that this stage is 'Sheji Cong Ren' (same as in [[Taijiquan]]). Give up yourself and comply with the opponent. Use 'Zhan, Lian, Nian, and Sui' (sticky, link, adhering, and complying). Everywhere you need to be empty and not exerting strength. The whole body must be blending and smooth (hun yuan - smooth roundness) and not starting and stopping. This is the skill of 'The opponent does not know me, I alone know the opponent.' At any time, place, or moment you can emit (fa), but only emitting force at the precise moment. This is the Hua Jing stage.

==Lineage chart==
The following chart, created by Shifu Jonathan Bluestein and Shifu Nitzan Oren, demonstrates the historical connections between most known lineages of Xing Yi Quan, and related martial arts. The chart is a collaborative project between Mr. Bluestein, who created the bulk of it, and several dozen Xing Yi Quan teachers from the West, who contributed information on their lineages and those of others. The chart project is well known in the Xing Yi Quan community, and the information contained in it has never been disputed (further contributions, suggestions and objections may be made by directly contacting Mr. Bluestein, at:  jonathan.bluestein{{@}}gmail.com). An attempt was made to include as many notable teachers as possible, but due to the obvious constraints of space, not all could have been included. Disciples are marked by a direct, full, downward-flowing line. Regular students are marked with a broken line.

Please note that a few minor details on the chart concerning people who had lived and taught prior to the 20th century are still somewhat controversial. This is due to a lack of profound historical documentation.

One of the more debated questions in this regard is who had been the teacher of Li Luoneng, the founder of modern Xing Yi Quan. It is known that Li studied with the Dai clan, but remains unclear who taught him. Some people and lineages have traditionally claimed that he was taught by master Dai Longbang. However, many others point to the fact that Longbang had died before Luoneng was born, or when Luoneng was quite young. Combined with the fact that Luoneng only arrived at Dai territory as a traveling adult, others argue that it would have been impossible for him to have studied under Longbang, and suggest his teacher was actually Longbang's student, [[Guo Weihan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinafrominside.com/ma/xyxy/guoweihan.html|title=ChinaFromInside.com presents...  XINYIQUAN &amp; XINGYIQUAN - Guo Weihan's Xinyiquan|website=Chinafrominside.com|accessdate=2016-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another historical controversy relates to who had been the teacher of the founder of Yi Quan, late master [[Wang Xiangzhai]] (~1886-1963). Most Yi Quan oral traditions have it that [[Guo Yunshen]], a student of the founder of modern Xing Yi (Li Luoneng), had been Wang Xiangzhai's teacher. However, since Wang was not yet alive (or been a young child) by the time of [[Guo Yunshen]]'s death, others suggest he must have learnt from Guo's other disciples ([[Li Bao]] 李豹 is thought to have been his true main teacher). The chart lists [[Li Bao]] as Wang's teacher, and [[Guo Yunshen]] as an indirect teacher due to the controversy surrounding the matter (until further historical evidence surfaces).

==Cross influences with other martial arts==

During the course of the late 19th century and 20th century, there had been a lot of cross-fertilization between notable masters of Xing Yi, and those of [[Bagua Zhang]] and [[Taijiquan|Taiji Quan]]. This has yielded many mutual influences.

[[Chen Panling]]'s Taiji Quan (originating from [[Taiwan]]) has been influenced by Xing Yi and Bagua.

Shanxi style Xing Yi in the line of Song Shirong has incorporated Bagua's Circle Walking practice, in either a circle, or tight squares or triangles (the latter practice referred to as 'Si Bu Pan Gen' - Four Step Base Encirclement).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wulinmingshi.wordpress.com/2011/09/18/xingyis-pangen-walking/|title=Xingyi’s Pangen walking|work=Masters of the IMA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cheng Tinghua]], a famous student of Bagua founder Dong Hai Chuan, is said to have taught his Bagua to many Xing Yi masters (including [[Gao Yisheng]], Geng Jishan and [[Sun Lutang]], of whom is written in the paragraphs below).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bagua.freehostia.com/chengtinghua.html|title=Cheng Ting Hua, Baguazhang Master|website=Bagua.freehostia.com|accessdate=2016-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gao Yisheng]]'s [[Gao Style Baguazhang|Gao Style Bagua Zhang]] has incorporated a lot of material from Xing Yi Quan, and his lineage, known as 'Yi Zong', includes the teaching of both arts.

Sun Lutang, one of the most famous practitioner of Xing Yi in the 20th century, had learnt Cheng style [[Bagua Zhang]] and Wu/Hao style [[Taijiquan|Taiji Quan]] after many decades of practicing Xing Yi. He then later went to develop his own unique forms of Bagua and Taiji, which were heavily influenced by his former experience training in Xing Yi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chinesemartialstudies.com/2013/01/07/lives-of-the-chinese-martial-artists-4-sun-lutang-and-the-invention-of-the-traditional-chinese-martial-arts-part-i/|title=Lives of Chinese Martial Artists (4): Sun Lutang and the Invention of the "Traditional" Chinese Martial Arts (Part I).|work=Kung Fu Tea}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many martial arts lines, notably that of Chen style [[Taijiquan|Taiji Quan]] from Chen village, have begun to practice the Zhan Zhuang posture known as Hun Yuan Zhuang (or Cheng Bao Zhuang) in recent decades. The origin of that posture in modern times is probably either Xing Yi Quan or Yi Quan, as it is basic in the arts' practices.

Contrary to some modern hypothesis proposed by [[Karate]] practitioners,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/notes/jonathan-bluestein/an-open-letter-of-reply-concerning-a-thorough-article-on-the-history-of-karate/10153842693494583|title=An open letter of reply concerning a thorough article on the history of Karate|website=Facebook.com|accessdate=2016-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Xing Yi was not "created based on Baji Quan and did not "influence greatly the development of Okinawan Karate". Rather, Okinawan Karate was most heavily influenced by southern-Chinese arts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://irkrs.blogspot.com.au/2013/04/siamese-boxing-original-source-of.html?m=1|title=International Ryukyu Karate Research Society/琉球唐手術国際研究會: Siamese Boxing - The original source of Okinawa-te [Ti'gwa/手小]?|website=Irkrs.blogspot.com.au|accessdate=2016-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is well substantiated in historical Karate literature, such as in the works of Patrick McCarthy sensei.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Bubishi-Classic-Manual-Patrick-McCarthy/dp/4805313846/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1464526805&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=bubishi|title=Bubishi: The Classic Manual of Combat|first1=search|last1=results|first2=Jesse|last2=Enkamp|first3=Joe|last3=Swift|date=21 June 2016|publisher=Tuttle Publishing|via=Amazon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural aspects of Xing Yi==

===Relationship with Chinese culture===
Like all traditional Chinese martial arts, Xing Yi too features a strong bond to the military, religious, philosophical and cultural traditions of [[China]].

Xing Yi's weapons are mostly ones which were used on Chinese battlefields throughout the centuries, with the [[Dao (sword)|dao]] and [[spear]] being the most prominent members of that group. Many consider the style to have originally been a 'military art' (as opposed to a sport like [[boxing]], or an urban self-defense system like [[Wing Chun]]).

Xing Yi's Five Shapes ('Five Elements') are a borrowed concept from [[Traditional Chinese Medicine]] (which is turn had borrowed them from [[Daoism]]).

The 12 Animal shapes were influenced, in part, by the [[Chinese zodiac]]. The [[Dragon (zodiac)|Dragon]], being the Chinese mythical animal, begets its supposed physical description and attributes from Chinese lore.

Like all [[Nei Jia]] arts, Xing Yi is heavily influenced by [[Daoism]]. Its combat meditation methods (Zhan Zhuang) existed in similar forms in Daoism before being integrated into martial arts in later centuries. The whole theory behind "using softness to overcome hardness" and similar ideas have their origins in the [[Dao De Jing]]. Daoist concepts are readily implemented into actual training in the practice of Xing Yi. This can be discerned in the following paragraph by [[Sun Lutang]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Sun Lu Tang (tran, Albert Liu)|title=Xing Yi Quan Xue: The Study of Form-Mind Boxing|page=68|publisher=Unique Publications|year=2000|isbn=0-86568-185-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; “Before training,  there is no thought or intention, no figure or image, no self or others, only Qi exists in the chaos of the body. The state is called WuJi in Xing Yi. Without knowing the principle of “inverse motion,” people always rigidly adhered to the principle of the “direct motion nature.” Hence the internal Qi is restrained and things cannot be properly realized due to an obscure mind that causes the body to be weak. They do not know the principle of health that extreme Yang leads to Yin and extreme Yin leads to death. However, sages can be versed in the way of inverse motion, and control the relation between Yin and Yang, manage the principal of creation, direct Liang Yi (another name for Yin and Yang), grasp the key points, and go back to the pre-natal from the post-natal realm to settle at the original position as the body becomes an integral unit. Its way is nothing more than the principle of stretching and contracting as in post-natal Wu Xing and Bagua boxing. This is called the generation of Qi from WuJi.”

===Popular culture appearances in modern times===
Xing Yi Quan has been featured in various media through the years.

*  In the ''[[Dead or Alive (series)|Dead or Alive]]'' series of video games, Gen Fu and Eliot employ the style.

*  In the ''[[Tekken]]'' series, Wang Jinrei uses Xing Yi Quan, while Michelle Chang and her daughter, Julia Chang, use Xing Yi mixed with wrestling and other Chinese martial arts.

*  In the Mortal Kombat series, Shao Kahn employs Xing Yi Quan as well as Tai Tsu Chang Quan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.screwattack.com/shows/originals/death-battle/death-battle-shao-kahn-vs-m-bison |title=Archived copy |accessdate=November 5, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105173916/http://www.screwattack.com/shows/originals/death-battle/death-battle-shao-kahn-vs-m-bison |archivedate=November 5, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Jet Li]] performed a modern Wushu adaptation of Xing Yi in the 2001 action movie ''[[The One (2001 film)|The One]]'' (seen used by the hero's evil alternate dimensional self in a multiverse).

*  In the manga series ''[[Negima!]]'', the title character studies Xing Yi as part of his Chinese martial arts training.

*  Xing Yi, as well as XinYi LiuHe Quan, are also featured in the manga series ''[[Kenji (manga)|Kenji]]''.

'''"Yusuf and Zulaikha"''' (the English transliteration of both names varies greatly) refers to a medieval Islamic version of the story of the prophet [[Joseph (Genesis)|Joseph]] and [[Potiphar's wife]] which has been told and retold countless times in many languages spoken in [[Muslim world]], such as [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]] and [[Urdu language|Urdu]]. Its most famous version was written in Persian language by [[Jami]] (1414-1492), in his [[Haft Awrang]] ("Seven Thrones").  The story has by then many elaborations, and is capable of a [[Sufi]] interpretation, where Zulaikha's longing for Yusuf represents the soul's quest for God.

== Other versions of the story ==
Other writers to have retold the story include: [[Mahmud Gami]] ([[Kashmiri language|Kashmiri]]). It is a standard tale used in [[Punjabi Qisse]].

There exists as well a long poem on the subject, titled as Yusuf and Zalikha, which used to be attributed to [[Ferdowsi]], the great Persian poet of the tenth and eleventh century, however, the scholars have rejected this book based on its low quality and the time line of Ferdowsi's life.&lt;ref&gt;'Yusuf and Zalikha: The Biblical Legend of Joseph and Potiphar's Wife in the Persian Version Ascribed to Abul-Mansur Qasim, Called Firdausi, ca. 932-1021 A.D.,' Edited by Hermann Ethé, Philo Press, Amsterdam, 1970&lt;/ref&gt;

== Yousuf and Zulaikha in Asia ==
As in many other [[Muslim]] countries, the narrative of the epic love of Yousuf and Zulaikha was covered in classic literary works of [[East Bengal]] (modern day [[Bangladesh]]): in the 14th century A.D. (during the reign of [[Sultan]] [[Ghiyasuddin Azam Shah]]), [[Shah Muhammad Sagir]] wrote in [[Bengali language|Bengali]] a version of ''[[Yusuf-Zulekha]]'' which is considered one of the greatest literary works of medieval "golden era" of [[Bengali literature]].

'''''Zodiac and Swastika: How Astrology Guided Hitler's Germany''''' ({{lang-de|Tierkreis und Hakenkreuz: Als Astrologe an Himmlers Hof}}) is a 1968 book by Wilhelm Wulff. It was released in 1973 in the United States by [[Coward, McCann &amp; Geoghegan]] and in the United Kingdom by [[Arthur Barker Limited]] of London. The English edition has a foreword by [[Walter Laqueur]].

[[Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke]] takes the book as evidence that Wulff was consulted by [[Heinrich Himmler]] in the last weeks of the war.&lt;ref&gt;(''[[The Occult Roots of Nazism]]'', p.&amp;nbsp;165)&lt;/ref&gt; However, Goodrick-Clarke does not deal with Wulff's claim that as early as 1943 he got the assignment to locate [[Benito Mussolini]], who had disappeared after being ousted from power.

Wulff claims that [[Arthur Nebe]] and [[Walter Schellenberg]] had assigned him various astrological tasks. He also mentions that they had used pendulum [[dowsing|dowsers]] like [[Ludwig Straniak]] for similar purposes.

At least one other book also makes allegation that a pendulum dowser called Dr. Wilhelm Gutberlet had been one of [[Adolf Hitler]]'s closest friends.&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Levenda]], ''Unholy Alliance''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thebirdman.org/Index/NetLoss/Irving/Irving-OcculticAspectsOfWW2-Levenda.html |title=Occultic Aspects of WW2: Four Excerpts from Peter Levenda's Unholy Alliance |publisher=Thebirdman.org |date=1943-07-25 |accessdate=2012-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; These claims, however, strongly appear to be just another example of the modern mythology of [[Nazism and occultism|Nazi occultism]].
