'''''1177 B.C.: The Year Civilization Collapsed''''' is a nonfiction ancient history book written by [[Eric H. Cline]] and published in 2014 by [[Princeton University Press]]. The book focuses on his hypothesis for the [[Late Bronze Age collapse]] of civilization,  a transition period that affected the Egyptians, [[Hittites]], [[Canaanites]], [[Cyprus|Cypriots]], Minoans, [[Mycenaeans]], Assyrians and Babylonians; varied heterogeneous cultures populating eight powerful and flourishing states intermingling via trade, commerce, exchange and "cultural piggybacking", despite "all the difficulties of travel and time".&lt;ref name=Gopnik/&gt; He presents evidence to support a "perfect storm" of "multiple interconnected failures", meaning that more than one natural and man-made cataclysm caused the disintegration and demise of an ancient civilization that incorporated "empires and globalized peoples".&lt;ref name=Gopnik/&gt;&lt;ref name=prince/&gt; This ended the [[Bronze Age]], and ended the Mycenaean, Minoan, Trojan, Hittite, and Babylonian cultures.&lt;ref name=prince/&gt; Before this book, the leading hypothesis during previous decades attributed the civilization collapse mostly to [[Sea Peoples]] of unknown origin.&lt;ref name=Gopnik&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4763">{{DISPLAYTITLE:2006 ''Idomeneo'' controversy}}
On September 26, 2006, the [[Deutsche Oper Berlin]] announced the cancellation of four performances of [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart's]] opera ''[[Idomeneo|Idomeneo, re di Creta]]'', planned for November 2006, citing concerns that the production's [[Depictions of Muhammad|depictions]] of the severed head of the [[Islam]]ic prophet [[Muhammad]] raised an "incalculable security risk." "To avoid endangering its audience and employees, the management has decided against repeating ''Idomeneo'' in November 2006," the opera house said in a press release.

The ''Idomeneo'' production, directed by [[Hans Neuenfels]], shows King Idomeneo staggering on stage carrying a bag of the severed heads of [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune]], [[Jesus]], [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] and Muhammad and placing each on chairs; a departure from the [[libretto]], in which the action is set in the aftermath of the [[Trojan War]]. Only Neptune features in the plot, and his power is never destroyed. The scene was intended to symbolize the people's release into freedom without gods or idols.

According to the [[BBC]], the German press agency DPA said Berlin police have so far recorded no direct threat to the opera house.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/5382554.stm "Religious fears force off opera"], BBC News. Retrieved September 26, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; However, ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that there was an anonymous threat in August against the theatre.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/27/world/europe/27germany.html?hp&amp;ex=1159416000&amp;en=b63d4e8f371503b6&amp;ei=5094&amp;partner=homepage "Opera Canceled Over a Depiction of Muhammad"], ''The New York Times''. Retrieved September 26, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

The cancellation sparked a great deal of debate in Europe on the issue of [[self-censorship]] and the nature of [[free speech]] in a multicultural community that includes potentially [[violent Muslims]]. On September 27, 2006, Germany's [[Chancellor of Germany (Federal Republic)|Chancellor]] [[Angela Merkel]] stated: "I think the cancellation was a mistake. I think self-censorship does not help us against people who want to practise violence in the name of Islam ... It makes no sense to retreat."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2006/09/28/story_28-9-2006_pg4_4 "Merkel warns against bowing to fear of Muslim violence"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131215012812/http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2006%2F09%2F28%2Fstory_28-9-2006_pg4_4 |date=2013-12-15 }}, ''[[Daily Times (Pakistan)|Daily Times]]''/[[Reuters]], 28 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Interior Minister [[Wolfgang Schäuble]], after a government-sponsored conference with Muslim representatives held independently of the incident, told reporters that "[t]o send a signal, we could all go to the performance together," and the Muslim representatives agreed that the performance should not be cancelled.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-407370/Muslims-agree-wrong-silence-Mozart-opera.html "Muslims agree it was wrong to silence Mozart opera"], ''[[Daily Mail]]'' (28 September 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 18, 2006, the Berlin Opera staged Mozart's work with the newly added controversial ending scene amid mixed reactions, but no incidents (with a small security force and large foreign media contingent). Demonstrators were present outside, as well, including supporters of [[religious tolerance]] and [[Christian]] protesters (presumably relating to the inclusion of the severed head of [[Jesus]]). Various members of German government attended with German Muslim groups, with the notable exception of the central Muslim Council's general secretary, Iman Mazyek, who was quoted by [[Al Jazeera English]] as saying, "It's part of the concept of freedom of opinion and thought that you also have the right to say you are not going.".&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/60DDFE0C-FB12-4212-BD70-0505EAAC14BA.htm Berlin police protect Mozart opera] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080103043631/http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/60DDFE0C-FB12-4212-BD70-0505EAAC14BA.htm |date=2008-01-03 }}, ''Al Jazeera English''&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Interlanguage link multi|Kirsten Harms|de}}, director of the Deutsche Opera, said that the public's reaction to the scene was "very civilized".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1478">The '''Agave''' (also '''Crophy''') are an ethnic group of [[Ghana]], belonging to the [[Ewe people]]s. They are mainly farmers living in the eastern [[Accra Plain]], west of the [[Volta River]] and north of the [[Songaw Lagoon]].&lt;ref name="Olson1996"&gt;{{cite book|last=Olson|first=James Stuart|title=The Peoples of Africa: an Ethnohistorical Dictionary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MdaAdBC-_S4C&amp;pg=PA10|accessdate=30 March 2012|year=1996|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-27918-8|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Agave people are one of the largest Ewe subgroups. They live in the southern part of the Volta region of the republic of Ghana. Currently, they are located around the delta and estuary of the Volta River on both the east and the west banks.

The Agave people have fifteen clans and are traditionally ruled by a paramount chief, surrounded by warrior chiefs.

Originally, they were part of the Agasuvi dynasty of the Adza Kingdom. Agave led the breakaway faction through many places including Ngortsie, Tsevie, Gafe, Agavedzi, Tsiame, Klidziand, and finally Agave Fedome. 

They brought the divine elephant Ivory Royal Stool from Adza to Agave which is the soul of the Agave people.

The Agave have specialised in riverine and wetland activity. They share the same culture with the Ewes of Togo and Dahomey.

The '''Ancient Order of Froth-Blowers''' was a humorous [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] charitable organisation "to foster the noble Art and gentle and healthy Pastime of [[froth]] blowing amongst Gentlemen of-leisure and ex-Soldiers". Running from 1924-1931, it was founded by Bert Temple, an ex-soldier and silk-merchant, initially to raise £100 (equal to £{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|100|1924}}}} today) for the children's [[charities]] of the [[surgeon]] [[Alfred Downing Fripp (surgeon)|Sir Alfred Fripp]]. One of the Order's first meeting places was the Swan, Fittleworth, W. Sussex - the 'No. 0 Vat'.&lt;ref&gt;The pubs that made history, Ian Herbert and Danielle Dwyer, ''The Independent'', London, February 10, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Temple founded the organisation in gratitude for life-saving stomach surgery by Fripp. Membership of this spoof order cost 5 [[shilling]]s (equal to £{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|0.25|1924}}}} today), each member receiving a pair of silver, enamelled [[cuff-link]]s and a membership booklet and card entitling them to blow froth off any member's beer "and occasionally off non-members' beer provided they are not looking or are of a peaceful disposition". The motto was "Lubrication in Moderation".

The idea was to meet regularly in [[Public house|pub]]s or clubs ("Vats") to enjoy "beer, beef and [[tobacco|baccy]]", possibly a memory of the [[Skeleton_Army]] of the 1880s, and there to be fined for heinous sins, such as not wearing the cuff-links (dinners opened with the highest-ranking member, the "Senior Blower", giving the command "Gentlemen, shoot your linen" at which point all members showed their cuffs&lt;ref&gt;Olden Times column "What was the Ancient Order of Froth Blowers", ''The Oldie'', January 2010&lt;/ref&gt;).  All fines and residual membership fees to be sent to Sir Alfred and Lady Fripp for their "Wee Waifs" of the [[East End of London]].

In late 1925, the [[editing|editor]] of ''[[The Sporting Times]]'' started to publish articles on the Order's gatherings, and the idea took hold of the public imagination. The now-retired Fripp travelled around the country as guest speaker at over 200 of these Vats, and thousands clamoured to join: men ("Blowers"), women ("Fairy Belles"), their children and their dogs ("Faithful Bow-Wows") were all enrolled. Those who enrolled others received titles such as  Blaster (25 members recruited), Tornado (100), up to Grand Typhoon (1000).

For five years the Froth Blowers extolled [[Britishness]] and "Lubrication in Moderation". Their song ''[[The More We Get Together|The More We Are Together]]'', an adaptation of ''[[Oh du lieber Augustin]]'' specially written by the pseudonymous [[Irving King]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.btinternet.com/~ianb/fofb/anthem.htm |title=The Ancient Order Of Froth Blowers Anthem |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929134818/http://www.btinternet.com/~ianb/fofb/anthem.htm |archivedate=September 29, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was heard everywhere.[https://scontent-jnb1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/36580721_10217158246256220_4569960222168186880_o.jpg?_nc_cat=0&amp;oh=1656e8c88f97d9a8ce160bd29db75baf&amp;oe=5BA29481]

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

By late 1928, 700,000 had joined, raising over £100,000 (equal to £{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|100000|1928}}}} today) for [[hospital]] cots, outings to the country, invalid children, etc. It endowed 40 hospital cots, funded holidays for thousands of needy children, and in 1929 established a roof garden for mothers and children on the Marylebone Housing Association's first block of [[slum clearance]] [[Apartment|flat]]s.

A plaque designed by artist and illustrator [[Henry Charles Innes Fripp]], cousin of Arthur Fripp, was created to accompany donations of £500 (about £20,000 in today's money) to fund the costs of 50 children's hospital beds.&lt;ref&gt;http://sculpture.gla.ac.uk/view/person.php?id=msib4_1245239565&lt;/ref&gt;

Their popularity was particularly upsetting to the [[Temperance movement|Temperance]] activists who believed that it was [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] which caused the "wee waifs'" suffering; not something a doctor and surgeon-to-the-King should be sponsoring. In 1927, Walter Greville of the [[International Organisation of Good Templars|Good Templars]] described it as "the latest recruited ally of the liquor trade", saying that "for ridiculous vulgarity and foolish methods it took the first prize".&lt;ref&gt;Back Bite: April 21, 1927, ''The Herald'', ''Sunday Herald'', Glasgow, April 21, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; Sir George Hunter, speaking for the Fellowship of Freedom and Reform in 1929, called the Froth Blowers "a disgrace to the country".&lt;ref&gt;Order Of Good Templars, ''The Times'', April 2, 1929&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, the [[Lord Chancellor]], [[Douglas Hogg, 1st Viscount Hailsham|Viscount Hailsham]], described it as "a great charitable organisation", and when Fripp died in 1930 his ''Times'' obituary said of the Froth Blowers, "These, by their innocent mirth, assisted by a catchy tune, have contributed largely to charities, and have entertained and brightened the lives of innumerable children".&lt;ref&gt;Sir Alfred Fripp, A Man Of Many Friends, ''The Times'', February 27, 1930&lt;/ref&gt;

The movement came to a natural end shortly after Fripp's death, when ''The Sporting Times'' folded and finally Bert Temple died in 1931. In that year the Ancient Order of Froth Blowers Limited went into voluntary liquidation. Residual money was used by Lady Fripp and her family to fund "Heartsease", a [[Girlguiding UK|Girl Guide]] retreat in the grounds of the West Wickham Home of Recovery for Children with Heart Disease, a hospital which had been partially funded by Froth Blower gifts in 1927.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ezitis.myzen.co.uk/cheyneww.html Lost Hospitals of London]&lt;/ref&gt; The Ancient Order of Froth Blowers Girl Guide and Boy Scout Charity Limited&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.creditgate.com/companysearch/ANCIENT+ORDER+OF+FROTH+BLOWERS+GIRL+GUIDE+AND+BOY+SCOUT+CHARITY+LTD.aspx ANCIENT ORDER OF FROTH BLOWERS GIRL GUIDE AND BOY SCOUT CHARITY LTD]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708203912/http://www.creditgate.com/companysearch/ANCIENT%2BORDER%2BOF%2BFROTH%2BBLOWERS%2BGIRL%2BGUIDE%2BAND%2BBOY%2BSCOUT%2BCHARITY%2BLTD.aspx |date=July 8, 2011 }} creditgate.com&lt;/ref&gt; still administers this site.

The '''Antemoro''' (or '''Antaimoro''') are an [[ethnic groups of Madagascar|ethnic group of Madagascar]] living on the southeastern coast, mostly between [[Manakara]] and [[Farafangana]]. Numbering around 500,000, this ethnic group traces its origins back to Arab settlers who arrived from Mecca in the 15th or 16th century. Upon settling in Madagascar, these Arabs converted the Antemoro to Islam; the religion was soon abandoned in favor of traditional beliefs and practices associated with respect for the ancestors, although remnants of Islam remain in ''[[Fady (taboo)|fady]]'' such as the prohibition against consuming pork. In the 16th century an Antemoro kingdom was established, supplanting the power of the earlier [[Zafiraminia]], who also descended from Arab seafarers. 

The Antemoro soon developed a reputation as powerful sorcerers and astrologers, in large part owing to their monopoly on knowledge of writing, termed ''[[sorabe]]'', which uses the Arabic script to transcribe the [[Malagasy language]]. Antemoro ''ombiasy'' (astrologer sages) migrated throughout the island, where they practiced their arts for local communities, served as advisers to kings, and even founded new principalities. This Antemoro mobility and their creation of a network of powerful spiritual advisers across the island is credited with forcing an awareness among Malagasy of communities beyond their own and sparking a sense of a common Malagasy identity. The Antemoro kingdom was disbanded in the late 19th century following an uprising of the Antemoro commoners against the noble class.

Today the Antemoro remain clustered around the southeast coastal homeland, where they grow rice and coffee, produce salt, and manufacture charms. The Antemoro often leave their homeland for six to ten months out of the year or more to work as ombiasy offering charms, spells, divinations and other arcane services.  Nearly every village in Madagascar has an ombiasy, and many are either Antemoro themselves or have traveled to the Antemoro homeland to receive training. The community's historic production of Antemoro paper, a flower-embedded paper traditionally used to record secret knowledge using sorabe, is another major source of income as the paper is commonly sold to tourists and exported overseas.

==Ethnic identity==
[[File:Ethnic groups of Madagascar Map.png|thumb|Distribution of Malagasy ethnic groups]]
"Antemoro", in the [[Malagasy language]], means "people of the coast". They live on the southeastern coast, mostly between [[Manakara]] and [[Farafangana]].{{sfn|Bradt|Austin|2007|p=23}} The Antemoro are descendants of [[Muslim]]s who settled in Madagascar in the 14th century and intermarried with the local population. In 2013 the Antemoro population was estimated at 500,000.{{sfn|Diagram Group|2013}} While there are claims that link them to Arabia, other scholars argue these people are more likely linked to groups originating in the Swahili coast.&lt;ref&gt;Solofo Randrianja and Stephen Ellis, ''Madagascar: A Short History'' (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2009), p. 57&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Antemoro figure among the more recent settlers on the island of Madagascar.{{sfn|Bradt|Austin|2007|p=23}} They are descended from Muslim seafarers who are believed to have arrived on the southeast coast around 1500. Boats carrying Muslim settlers had arrived on Madagascar's shores in the past, but there was a marked uptick in arrivals around this time. Upon arrival they encountered several other [[ethnic groups of Madagascar|Malagasy ethnic groups]] including the Zafiraminia, who also traced their origins back to [[Mecca]] by way of East Africa, although some scholars suggest that the origins of the Zafiraminia was in Sumatra&lt;ref&gt;Randrianja and Ellis, ''Madagascar'', p. 62&lt;/ref&gt; and who had developed a high status among Malagasy communities for the knowledge and technology they had carried with them from overseas, and who had the prerogative of practicing ritual animal sacrifice for the ancestors (''sombili''), a highly powerful and important rite among Malagasy communities. Oral and written historical traditions of the Antemoro describe their desire to secure marriages between the two communities, but these efforts were rejected by the Zafiraminia. A conflict developed between the two groups for supremacy, which the oral histories of other Malagasy groups describe as a battle between two giants. The conflict evolved as additional Arab settlers arrived and joined with their fellow newcomers to become Antemoro themselves.{{sfn|Ogot|1992|p=853}}

[[File:Ambalavao Papier Antaimoro.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Antemoro paper is still commonly produced in Madagascar in centers such as [[Ambalavao]] (pictured).]]
Around 1550 the mounting conflict seems to have reached a turning point with the Zafikasimambo noble family rising to power in Matitana following the family leader's marriage to a local woman. Historical texts tie the lineage of the family's leader, Zafikazimambobe, to Anteony noble Ramarohala, who had settled there at least three generations before. Other historical sources confirm however that the genealogy described in these texts is not factual, and that the Zafikazimambo family had only newly arrived and so had no demonstrable descent from local nobles. Rather, these texts suggest that it took over three generations for the Antemoro to successfully integrate into the society through intermarriage and other means, and also reflect an awareness among the Antemoro of the importance of local caste and lineage traditions and their need to find a place within them. Upon rising to power, the Zafikasimambo clan absorbed the ritual privileges of the former Zafiraminia clan and had established themselves as the premier ''ombiasy'' (wise men) who practiced astrology and served as scribes; they regularly left the Antemoro homeland to provide their services where needed. These ombiasy also often trained the spiritual leaders of other communities, further reinforcing the preeminence of the Matitana ombiasy as masters of arcane knowledge and those outside their clan who sought to learn or dispense it. The Zafikasimambo used their right to conduct ''sombily'' (ritual sacrifice) to shape and increasingly control political and economic activities in the area. To end the conflict with the Zafiraminia, they executed as many males of the group as possible and relegated the women and children to restricted areas. In this way they established the first strong Antemoro kingdom.{{sfn|Ogot|1992|p=853}} They are rare among Malagasy clans as newcomers who successfully established their own kingdom within a short time after landing on the island.{{sfn|Ogot|1992|p=856}}

Under Antemoro Zafikasimambo leadership, the commoners' freedom was significantly reduced and religion became a central feature of social and political life. The conflict between the Antemoro and Zafiraminia nobles and the resulting Zafikasimambo rule also established a tradition of emigration from this part of the island. Unlike the majority of Malagasy who generally seek to return to their ancestral land, the Antemoro initially felt no such call to remain linked to a geographic area. As a result, the ombiasy of the Antemoro traveled widely, some moving from place to place and others settling permanently at royal courts and elsewhere. Their arcane knowledge of writing, medicine, technology and other areas both established their reputation as indispensable advisers to nobles and commoners alike, and instilled the island-wide feature of the community astrologer who shapes daily life. The ombiasy of Matitana were According to historian Bethwell Ogot, the network of stationary and itinerant Antemoro ombiasy were key in transforming the societies of Madagascar from an amalgam of insular clans to outward looking communities with greater awareness of others, leading to territorial expansion and larger, more complex kingdoms.{{sfn|Ogot|1992|p=854}} In addition, oral histories suggest that sovereigns among the [[Kingdom of Imerina|Merina]], [[Tanala]] and [[Antanosy]] may have had ancestors who migrated away from Antemoro country.{{sfn|Ogot|1992|p=855}}

By the early 18th century, the Antemoro had established themselves as major rice and slave exporters.{{sfn|Ogot|1992|p=885}} Throughout the 1700s, the Antemoro were embroiled in a conflict with the Ikongo-[[Tanala]] that culminated in a bloody Tanala invasion of the eastern coastal plain. Shortly afterward, a major Antemoro leader named Andriamamohotra established an alliance and vassal relationship with the king then ruling Imerina, [[Andrianampoinimerina]], to reestablish peace.{{sfn|Ogot|1992|p=880}}

==Society==
Antemoro villages are primarily clustered in the southeastern coastal area near [[Vohipeno]] and [[Manakara]].{{sfn|Bradt|Austin|2007|p=23}} Society was traditionally divided into two broad categories: the ''mpanombily'' (or ''tompomenakely''), who were nobles said to be descended from Arabs from Mecca, and the ''menakely'', composed of the working and slave classes, who were said to have descended from the local Malagasy who submitted to the Arabs' rule, or alternately from slaves that the Arabs had brought with them.{{sfn|Gennep|1904|p=130}} The mpanombily comprised many noble clans such as the Anakara, Onjatsy, Tsimaito, Antaiony, Antalaotra, Antaisambo, Antaimahazo and others.{{sfn|Gennep|1904|p=130}} Particular clans within Antemoro society historically held distinct privileges and responsibilities. The butchering of certain animals for human consumption was assigned to specific clans.{{sfn|Gennep|1904|p=139}}

Antemoro kings (''andrianony''{{sfn|Hamès|2007|page=242}}) were selected by popular decision from among the Anakara clan, originally clustered around the mouth of the Matitanana river near the town of Manakara that shares their name. Once selected, these rulers were accorded a near-sacred status. The ''[[Fady (taboo)|fady]]'' they established were scrupulously observed for centuries after the ruler's death.{{sfn|Gennep|1904|p=81}} The Anakara were responsible for safeguarding the sacred Antemoro idols and texts, spoke a secret language for communicating arcane knowledge amongst themselves, and rarely intermarried with other Antemoro clans.{{sfn|Ferrand|1902|p=12}}  This clan was believed to be in communication with powerful [[djinn|genies]] (''ziny'') and other spirits and was reputed to produce the most powerful sorcerers and astrologers on the island.{{sfn|Gennep|1904|p=42}} They knew how to manufacture charms, cast spells, and practice geomancy using local gemstones.{{sfn|Hamès|2007|page=242}} To maintain their distinction from other members of Antemoro society, the Anakara lived in villages sealed off by spiked wooden palisades where none could enter without permission.{{sfn|Gennep|1904|p=42}} Rulers were further distinguished by ''fady'' forbidding them to wear shirts or hats.{{sfn|Gennep|1904|p=113}}

===Family affiliation===
Each Antemoro clan was endogamous and marriage outside the clan was deeply taboo.{{sfn|Gennep|1904|p=136}} Those who transgressed were mourned as if dead and were entirely cut off from the community.{{sfn|Gennep|1904|p=160}}

===Religious affiliation===
The Antemoro adhere to the traditional spiritual beliefs and practices common throughout the island, although different Antemoro clans and families incorporate aspects of Islam to varying degrees.{{sfn|Gennep|1904|p=5}}  They commonly make and wear amulets upon which verses of the Qur'an are written using the ''[[sorabe]]'' script.{{sfn|Bradt|Austin|2007|p=23}} Before converting to Islam in the seventh or eighth century, the Malagasy clans that later intermarried with Arabs to found the Antemoro dynasty were monotheists who believed in a creator god and numerous spirits that served as intermediaries between living beings and the creator. By the time of conversion to Islam, the creator god had been all but forgotten, with much greater focus placed on the spirits, who had been raised to the level of deities. The arrival of Arab settlers prompted large scale conversion to Islam, but the core tenets were soon lost and gave way to the honoring of ancestors and their ''fady''.{{sfn|Gennep|1904|p=5}}

==Culture==
Arab and Islamic influences strongly mark Antemoro culture. Traditionally, Antemoro men's clothing included a turban or fez style hat and long, loose robes similar to those worn in many other parts of the Muslim world.{{sfn|Bradt|Austin|2007|p=302}} ''Harefo'' reeds were woven to form mats (''tafitsihy'') that were sewn together to form jackets and tunics (with long sleeves for older men); a loincloth made of ''fanto'' (beaten [[barkcloth]]) was worn beneath the ensemble. Women wore sleeveless sheath dresses made from two or three reed mats sewn together and belted at the waist or drawn over one shoulder. Adolescent and adult women often also wore a mat bandeau or halter top.{{sfn|Condra|2013|p=456}} It was historically forbidden for women to wear lambas made of cotton or any other material than woven raffia mats, as it was believed this could render them more attractive to men outside their clan, with whom they were forbidden to marry.{{sfn|Gennep|1904|p=160}}

The Antemoro were reputed across the island for being the only ethnic group to have developed a written form of the Malagasy language, sorabe, which used Arabic script; this form of writing was largely replaced elsewhere by the Latin alphabet under the [[Kingdom of Imerina|Merina monarchy]] in the 19th century.{{sfn|Bradt|Austin|2007|p=23}}  The Antemoro were also widely reputed in the pre-colonial period for their [[astrology|astrologers]], who would predict the future based on [[lunar phases]]. They were known all across Madagascar and acted as advisers at the court of many [[List of Malagasy monarchs|Malagasy kings]], including the celebrated [[Merina people|Merina]] king [[Andrianampoinimerina]], whose Antemoro astrologers advised him and taught him sorabe writing. The pan-Madagascar tradition of the ombiasy  is rooted in this element of Antemoro culture.{{sfn|Bradt|Austin|2007|p=17}}  The introduction of royal ''[[sampy]]'' (idols) into the [[Kingdom of Imerina]] is likewise attributed to an Antemoro ombiasy.{{sfn|Gennep|1904|p=131}}

===''Fady''===
Taboos (''[[fady (taboo)|fady]]'') among the Antemoro derive from ancestral traditions as well as from aspects of Islamic and Arab culture.  An Antemoro taboo against dogs as unclean, although shared by Islam, actually predates the arrival of the religion on the island.{{sfn|Gennep|1904|p=6}} The prohibition against eating pork, however, originated with the introduction of Islam. Traditionally, members of a given Antemoro clan could only eat with others of the same clan.{{sfn|Gennep|1904|p=137}}

===Funeral rites===
The death of any member of the community is mourned in the same way, regardless of social class. All community members participate in a week-long period of mourning for the deceased, during which time they are forbidden to wash or change clothing.  On the eighth day, the mourning period is broken and everyone bathes and dresses in fresh attire. A female widow must continue the mourning period until the parents of the deceased declare it completed. A male widower remains shut away in his home for a period of one or two weeks, during which time the parents of the deceased send a female family member to care for him and keep him company.{{sfn|Gennep|1904|p=63}}
&lt;!--===Dance and music===--&gt;

==Language==
The Antemoro speak a dialect of the [[Malagasy language]], which is a branch of the [[Malayo-Polynesian languages|Malayo-Polynesian language group]] derived from the [[Barito languages]], spoken in southern [[Borneo]].  The language is traditionally written using the sorabe script, and those who master this form of writing are called ''katibo'' and are considered to possess unusual power.  Sorabe writings traditionally ranged from instructional texts for teaching astrology, to historical records and other forms of documentation, and materials written using the sorabe script were considered to be sacred.{{sfn|Bradt|Austin|2007|p=302}}

==Economy==
Many Antemoro work as ombiasy and earn their livelihood selling their services as astrologers, sorcerers, or crafters of powerful amulets; it is common for men to travel for six to ten months out of the year.{{sfn|Gennep|1904|p=169}} Coffee production is widespread in the Antemoro homeland and generates income for many families.  Those who own little or no land often emigrate to work as agricultural laborers in the north and west.{{sfn|Thompson|Adloff|1965|page=264}} The Antemoro Ampanira clan was historically a main producer and trader of sea salt.{{sfn|Campbell|2012|page=455}} The Antemoro are well known for their handmade paper, which is often decorated using pressed fresh flowers and leaves. Antemoro paper is a major product marketed to tourists.{{sfn|Bradt|Austin|2007|p=302}}

==Notable Antemoro==
The first formal school in the [[Kingdom of Imerina]] was established and run from 1800 to 1804 by two Antemoro ombiasy, Andriamahazonoro and Ratsilikaina, who taught the future King [[Radama I]] and four or five other children to read using sorabe, trained them to manufacture ink and paper, and educated them in the art of astrology and divination.{{sfn|Campbell|2012|page=527}} Andriamahazonoro was among the party of three who served as the first ambassadors to Britain and Mauritius; he died in 1838 from ''[[tangena]]'' poison administered in a trial by ordeal during the reign of Queen [[Ranavalona I]].{{sfn|Campbell|2012|page=627}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1337">The '''Anti-Corruption and Governance Research Center''' of [[Tsinghua University]] was established in November 2000. It is [[China]]'s first university-based institute devoted to anti-[[Political corruption|corruption]] research.

The center has formed a [[multidisciplinary]] research team and it also benefits from its advisors, including Professor [[Susan Rose-Ackerman]] of [[Yale University]].

The Center aims to assist China's ongoing anti-corruption campaign with high quality research on corruption control, corruption prevention and [[good governance]]. 

Most of the Center's current research projects concentrate on how China can prevent various types of corruption from happening through [[institutional reform]]s. The center has successfully carried out a number of important research projects on topics such as China's corruption prevention strategies, corruption prevention strategies of the [[2008 Beijing Olympic Games]], etc.

The Center aspires to become an important [[think tank]] on anti-corruption policies both in China and worldwide.

[[Nuclear weapons tests in Australia|Nuclear weapons testing]], [[Uranium mining in Australia|uranium mining]] and export, and [[Nuclear power in Australia|nuclear power]] have often been the subject of public debate in Australia, and the '''anti-nuclear movement in Australia''' has a long history. Its origins date back to the 1972–73 debate over [[French nuclear testing]] in the Pacific and the 1976–77 debate about [[uranium mining in Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Jim Green (activist)|Green, Jim]] (26 August 1998).

Several groups specifically concerned with nuclear issues were established in the mid-1970s, including the Movement Against Uranium Mining and [[Campaign Against Nuclear Energy]] (CANE), cooperating with other environmental groups such as [[Friends of the Earth Australia|Friends of the Earth]] and the [[Australian Conservation Foundation]].&lt;ref name=bau&gt;McLeod, Roy (1995).

"Resistance to Nuclear Technology: Optimists, Opportunists and Opposition in Australian Nuclear History" in Martin Bauer (ed) ''Resistance to New Technology'', Cambridge University Press, pp. 175–177.&lt;/ref&gt;

About 2003, proponents of nuclear power advocated it as a solution to [[global warming]] and the Australian government began taking an interest.  [[Anti-nuclear]] campaigners and some scientists in Australia argued that nuclear power could not significantly substitute for other power sources, and that [[uranium mining]] itself could become a significant source of greenhouse gas emissions.&lt;ref name=md/&gt;&lt;ref name=jg/&gt;

As of 2015, Australia has no nuclear power stations and five uranium mines, four of which are located in South Australia. [[Olympic Dam, South Australia|Olympic Dam]] (Roxby Downs) is a large underground mine, [[Beverley Uranium Mine|Beverley]], [[Four Mile uranium mine|Four Mile]] and [[Honeymoon]] are [[in-situ leach]] mines and [[Ranger Uranium Mine|Ranger]] in an [[open pit]] mine in the Northern Territory.&lt;ref name="ABC News 2010"&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/04/24/2552242.htm?section=justin Work begins on Honeymoon uranium mine] (24 April 2009), ''ABC News''.

==History==

===1950s and 1960s===
{{See also|Nuclear weapons tests in Australia}}
[[File:AusNucTestSites.svg|300px|thumb|Map showing nuclear test sites in Australia]]

In 1952 the Australian Government established the [[Rum Jungle, Northern Territory|Rum Jungle Uranium Mine]] 85 kilometres south of Darwin. Local aboriginal communities were not consulted and the mine site became an environmental disaster.&lt;ref name=jv/&gt;

Also in 1952, the [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal Government]] passed legislation, the ''Defence (Special Undertakings) Act 1952'', which allowed the British Government access to remote parts of Australia to undertake atmospheric nuclear weapons tests. The general public were largely unaware of the risks from the testing program, stemming from official secrecy about the testing program and the remote locations of the test sites.&lt;ref name=brit&gt;Australian Government. [http://www.aic.gov.au/en/publications/previous%20series/lcj/1-20/wayward/ch16.aspx A toxic legacy: British nuclear weapons testing in Australia].&lt;/ref&gt; But as the "Ban the Bomb" movement gathered momentum in Western societies throughout the 1950s, so too did opposition to the British tests in Australia. An opinion poll taken in 1957 showed 49 per cent of the Australian public were opposed to the tests and only 39 per cent in favour.&lt;ref name=brit/&gt;

In 1963, Australia was one of the first signatories to a [[Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www3.austlii.edu.au/au/other/dfat/treaties/1963/26.html "Treaty banning Nuclear Weapon Tests in the Atmosphere, in Outer Space and Under Water ATS 26 of 1963"]. Australasian Legal Information Institute, Australian Treaties Library. Retrieved on 15 April 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1964, Peace Marches which featured "Ban the bomb" placards, were held in several Australian capital cities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:114192 Women with Ban the Bomb banner during Peace march on Sunday 5 April 1964, Brisbane, Australia] Retrieved 15 December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:114194 Girl with placard Ban nuclear tests during Peace march on Sunday 5 April 1964, Brisbane, Australia] Retrieved 15 December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1969, a 500 MW nuclear power plant was [[Jervis Bay Nuclear Power Plant|proposed for the Jervis Bay Territory]], 200&amp;nbsp;km south of [[Sydney]].&lt;ref name=bau/&gt; A local opposition campaign began, and the South Coast Trades and Labour Council (covering workers in the region) announced that it would refuse to build the reactor.&lt;ref&gt;Falk, Jim (1982). ''Gobal Fission:The Battle Over Nuclear Power'', p. 260.&lt;/ref&gt; Some environmental studies and site works were completed, and two rounds of tenders were called and evaluated, but in 1971 the Australian government decided not to proceed with the project, citing economic reasons.&lt;ref name=bau/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'Gorton gave nod to nuclear power plant', (1 January 2000), ''The Age''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1972–73 debate over [[French nuclear testing]] in the Pacific mobilised several groups, including some trade unions.&lt;ref name="Martin" /&gt; In 1972 the [[International Court of Justice]] in a case launched by Australia and New Zealand, and advocated by Dr [[Helen Caldicott]], ordered that the French cease atmospheric nuclear testing at [[Mururoa]] atoll.&lt;ref&gt;Dewes, Kate and Green, Robert (1999). [http://www.disarmsecure.org/Aotearoa_New_Zealand_At_The_World_Court.pdf Aotera/ New Zealand at the World Court] The Raven Press, pp. 11–15.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1973 Australia's concerns saw it as a champion and an early adopter of the [[Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www3.austlii.edu.au/au/other/dfat/treaties/1973/3.html “Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons .

Retrieved on 15 April 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; and around this time, the Government ratified the [[Seabed Arms Control Treaty]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www3.austlii.edu.au/au/other/dfat/treaties/1973/4.html “Treaty on the Prohibition of the Emplacement of Nuclear Weapons and other Weapons of Mass Destruction on the Sea-Bed and the Ocean Floor and in the Subsoil Thereof . ATS 4 of 1973”]. Australasian  Legal Information Institute, Australian Treaties Library. Retrieved on 15 April 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after this, the Government negotiated with the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] to put in safeguards to ensure Australia could mine and export nuclear material but not breach the intent of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www3.austlii.edu.au/au/other/dfat/treaties/1974/16.html "Agreement between Australia and the International Atomic Energy Agency for the Application of Safeguards in connection with the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons of 1 July 1968 ATS 16 of 1974 "]. Australasian Legal Information Institute, Australian Treaties Library. Retrieved on 15 April 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1974 and 1975 concern came to focus on uranium mining in Australia and several [[Friends of the Earth]] groups were formed.&lt;ref name="Martin" /&gt; The [[Australian Conservation Foundation]] also began voicing concern about uranium mining and supporting the activities of the grass-roots organisations. Concern about the environmental effects of uranium mining was a significant factor and poor management of waste at an early uranium mine, [[Rum Jungle, Northern Territory|Rum Jungle]], led it to become a significant pollution problem in the 1970s.&lt;ref name="Martin" /&gt; The Australian anti-nuclear movement also acquired initial impetus from notable individuals who publicly voiced nuclear concerns, such as nuclear scientists Richard Temple and Rob Robotham, and poets [[Dorothy Auchterlonie|Dorothy Green]] and [[Judith Wright]].&lt;ref name="Martin"&gt;Martin, Brian (Summer 1982). [http://www.bmartin.cc/pubs/82alternatives.html The Australian anti-uranium movement] ''Alternatives: Perspectives on Society and Environment'', Volume 10, Number 4, pp. 26–35. Retrieved 15 December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1975, [[Moss Cass]], [[Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts (Australia)|Minister for the Environment and Conservation]], led parliamentarians and ALP branch members in expressing concerns about the effects of [[uranium mining]]. A key concern was the adverse effect that uranium mining would have on the northern Aboriginal people. Cass said: "nuclear energy creates the most dangerous, insidious and persistent waste products, ever experienced on the planet".&lt;ref&gt;[[Jim Falk]] (1982). ''Global Fission: The Battle Over Nuclear Power'', Oxford University Press, pp. 258-259.&lt;/ref&gt;

The years 1976 and 1977 saw uranium mining become a major political issue, with the [[Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry|Ranger Inquiry (Fox) report]] opening up a public debate about uranium mining.&lt;ref name="mb"&gt;Bauer, Martin (ed) (1995). ''Resistance to New Technology'', Cambridge University Press, p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt; Several groups specifically concerned with nuclear issues were established, including the Movement Against Uranium Mining (founded in 1976) and [[Campaign Against Nuclear Energy]] (formed in South Australia in 1976), cooperating with other environmental groups such as Friends of the Earth (which came to Australia in 1975) and the Australian Conservation Foundation (formed in 1975).&lt;ref name="Hutton"&gt;Hutton, Drew and Connors, Libby (1999). ''A History of the Australian Environmental Movement'', Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mb" /&gt;

In November and December 1976, 7,000 people marched through the streets of Australian cities, protesting against uranium mining. The Uranium Moratorium group was formed and it called for a five-year moratorium on uranium mining.  In April 1977 the first national demonstration co-ordinated by the Uranium Moratorium brought around 15,000 demonstrators into the streets of Melbourne, 5,000 in Sydney, and smaller numbers elsewhere.&lt;ref name="jf"&gt;Falk, Jim (1982). ''Global Fission:The Battle Over Nuclear Power'', pp. 264–5.&lt;/ref&gt; A National signature campaign attracted over 250,000 signatures calling for a five-year moratorium.  In August, another demonstration brought 50,000 people out nationally and the opposition to uranium mining looked like a potential political force.&lt;ref name="jf" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cawte, Alice (1992). ''Atomic Australia 1944–1990'', New South Wales University Press, p. 156.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1977, the [[Australian Labor Party National Conference|National Conference]] of the [[Australian Labor Party]] (ALP) passed a motion in favour of an indefinite moratorium on uranium mining, and the anti-nuclear movement acted to support the Labor Party and help it regain office. However, a setback for the movement occurred in 1982 when another ALP conference overturned its anti-uranium policy in favour of a "one mine policy". After the ALP won power in 1983, its 1984 National Conference voted in favour of a "[[Three mine policy]]".&lt;ref&gt;Burgmann, Verity (2003).

Labor &amp; uranium: an evolution, ''Labor E-herald''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1977-78, the West Australian Government, under the leadership of [[Charles Court]], announced plans for a nuclear power reactor near Perth. 1977 was seen as the year of mass mobilization in WA, with 300 at the first anti-nuclear demonstration to 9,000 at the third protest in the inner city of Perth. Despite public protest, the WA Government selected a first site for a nuclear reactor in 1979 at Wilbinga, 70 kilometres north of Perth. Court predicted that at least another 20 nuclear power plants would be needed by the end of the century to meet rapidly growing power demand, but all of this never eventuated.&lt;ref name="Martin" /&gt;

From the late 1970s, a number of agreements were signed enabling the potential peaceful export (and import) of nuclear material:
* In July 1978 with [[Finland]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www3.austlii.edu.au/au/other/dfat/treaties/1980/4.html “Agreement between the Government of Australia and the Government of the Republic of Finland concerning the Transfer of Nuclear Material between Australia and Finland.

These International agreements created a market for Australia to mine and export uranium.

===1980s and 1990s===
Between 1979 and 1984, the majority of what is now [[Kakadu National Park]] was created, surrounding but not including the Ranger uranium mine. Tension between mining and conservation values led to long running [[Uranium mining in Kakadu National Park|controversy around mining in the Park region]].

The two themes for the 1980 [[Hiroshima Day]] march and rally in Sydney, sponsored by the [[Movement Against Uranium Mining]] (MAUM), were:  "Keep uranium in the ground" and "No to nuclear war."  Later that year, the Sydney city council officially proclaimed Sydney nuclear-free, in an action similar to that taken by many other local councils throughout Australia.&lt;ref name="lsw" /&gt;

In the 1980s, academic critics (such as [[Jim Falk]]) discussed the "deadly connection" between uranium mining, nuclear reactors and nuclear weapons, linking Australia's nuclear policy to [[nuclear proliferation]] and the "plutonium economy".&lt;ref name="mc" /&gt;

In the 1980s, Australia experienced a significant growth of nuclear disarmament activism: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
On Palm Sunday 1982, an estimated 100,000 Australians participated in anti-nuclear rallies in the nation's biggest cities. Growing year by year, the rallies drew 350,000 participants in 1985.&lt;ref name="lsw" /&gt; The movement focused on halting Australia's uranium mining and exports, abolishing nuclear weapons, removing foreign military bases from Australia's soil, and creating a nuclear-free Pacific. Public opinion surveys found that about half of Australians opposed uranium mining and export, as well as the visits of U.S. nuclear warships, that 72 percent thought the use of nuclear weapons could never be justified, and that 80 percent favoured building a nuclear-free world.&lt;ref name="lsw"&gt;Wittner, Lawrence S. (22 June 2009). [http://www.japanfocus.org/-Lawrence_S_-Wittner/3179 Nuclear Disarmament Activism in Asia and the Pacific, 1971–1996] ''The Asia-Pacific Journal'', Vol. 25-5-09.&lt;/ref&gt;  
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[Nuclear Disarmament Party]] won a Senate seat in 1984, but soon faded from the political scene.&lt;ref name="chron" /&gt; The years of the Hawke-Keating ALP governments (1983–1996) were characterised by an "uneasy standoff in the uranium debate". The ALP acknowledged community feeling against uranium mining but was reluctant to move against the industry.&lt;ref name="past"&gt;Martin, Brian (Second Quarter 2007). [http://www.bmartin.cc/pubs/07sa.html Opposing nuclear power: past and present] ''Social Alternatives'', Vol. 26, No. 2, pp. 43–47. Retrieved 15 December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bb" /&gt;

The 1986 Palm Sunday anti-nuclear rallies drew 250,000 people.  In Melbourne, the seamen's union boycotted the arrival of foreign nuclear warships.&lt;ref name="lsw" /&gt;

Australia's only nuclear energy education facility, the former School of Nuclear Engineering at the [[University of New South Wales]], closed in 1986.&lt;ref name="agelidis"&gt;Agelidis, Vassilios (7 December 2010). [http://www.abc.net.au/unleashed/41882.html Too late for nuclear] ''ABC News''.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the late 1980s, the price of uranium had fallen, and the costs of nuclear power had risen, and the anti-nuclear movement seemed to have won its case. The Campaign Against Nuclear Energy disbanded itself in 1988,&lt;ref name="mc" /&gt; two years after the [[Chernobyl Disaster]].

The government policy preventing new uranium mines continued into the 1990s, despite occasional reviews and debate. Following protest marches in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane during 1998, a proposed mine at [[Jabiluka]] was blocked.&lt;ref name="past" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bb" /&gt;

Also in 1998, there was a proposal from an international consortium, [[Pangea Resources]], to establish a [[nuclear waste]] dump in Western Australia. The plan, to store 20 per cent of the world's spent nuclear fuel and weapons material, was "publicly condemned and abandoned".&lt;ref name="chron"&gt;[[Four Corners (Australian TV program)|Four Corners]].

In 2000, the [[Ranger Uranium Mine]] in the [[Northern Territory]] and the [[Olympic Dam, South Australia|Roxby Downs/Olympic Dam]] mine in [[South Australia]] continued to operate, but [[Nabarlek Uranium Mine]] had closed. A third uranium mine, [[Beverley Uranium Mine]] in SA, was also operating. Several advanced projects, such as Honeymoon in SA, Jabiluka in the Northern Territory and Yeelirrie in WA were on hold because of political and indigenous opposition.&lt;ref name=chron/&gt;&lt;ref name=bb&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/74196.stm Anti-uranium demos in Australia] (5 April 1998), ''BBC News''.

In May 2000 there was an anti-nuclear demonstration at the [[Beverley Uranium Mine]], which involved about 100 protesters.

Following the [[McClelland Royal Commission]], a large clean-up was completed in outback South Australia in 2000, after [[British nuclear tests at Maralinga|nuclear testing at Maralinga]] during the 1950s contaminated the region. The cleanup lasted three years, and cost over A$100&amp;nbsp;million, but there was controversy over the methods used and success of the operation.&lt;ref name="chron" /&gt;

On 17 December 2001, 46 Greenpeace activists occupied the Lucas Heights facility to protest the construction of a second research reactor. Protestors gained access to the grounds, the HIFAR reactor, the high-level radioactive waste store and the radio tower. Their protest highlighted the security and environmental risks of the production of nuclear materials and the shipment of radioactive waste from the facility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/science/articles/2001/12/18/443080.htm|title=Greenpeace raid on Australian nuclear reactor|date=18 December 2001|website=www.abc.net.au|accessdate=4 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As uranium prices began rising from about 2003, proponents of nuclear power advocated it as a solution to [[global warming]] and the Australian government began taking an interest. However, in June 2005, the Senate passed a motion opposing nuclear power for Australia.&lt;ref name="chron" /&gt; Then, in November 2006, the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry and Resources released a pro-nuclear report into Australia's uranium.&lt;ref&gt;House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry and Resources (2006).

Western Australia has a significant share of the Australia's uranium reserves, but between 2002 and 2008, a statewide ban on uranium mining was in force. The ban was lifted when the Liberal Party was voted into power in the state and, as of 2010, many companies are exploring for uranium in Western Australia. One of the industry's major players, the mining company [[BHP Billiton]], planned to develop the [[Yeelirrie uranium project]] in a 17&amp;nbsp;billion dollar project.&lt;ref&gt;Boylan, Jessie (9 August 2010).

As of late 2010, there are calls for Australians to debate whether the nation should adopt nuclear power as part of its energy mix. Nuclear power is seen to be "a divisive issue that can arouse deep passions among those for and against".&lt;ref name=agelidis/&gt;

Following the March 2011 [[Fukushima I nuclear accidents|Fukushima nuclear emergency]] in Japan, where three nuclear reactors were damaged by explosions, [[Ian Lowe]] sees the nuclear power option as being risky and unworkable for Australia. Lowe says nuclear power is too expensive, with insurmountable problems associated with waste disposal and weapons proliferation. It is also not a fast enough response to address climate change. Lowe advocates [[renewable energy]] which is "quicker, less expensive and less dangerous than nuclear".&lt;ref name=lowenuke&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theage.com.au/opinion/politics/no-nukes-now-or-ever-20110319-1c1ed.html |title=No nukes now, or ever |author=Ian Lowe  |date=20 March 2011 |work=The Age }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2011, the sale of uranium to India was a contentious issue. MPs clashed over the issue and protesters were marched from Sydney's convention centre before Prime Minister [[Julia Gillard]]'s motion to remove a party ban on uranium sales to India was narrowly supported 206 votes to 185. Long-time anti-nuclear campaigner [[Peter Garrett]] MP spoke against the motion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/more-news/anti-nuclear-protesters-interrupt-labors-national-conference/story-fn7x8me2-1226213375804 |title=Labor supports Julia Gillard's plan to sell uranium to India |author=Matthew Johnston  |date=4 December 2011 |work=Herald Sun }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2012, hundreds of anti-nuclear demonstrators converged on the Australian headquarters of global mining giants BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto. The 500-strong march through southern Melbourne called for an end to uranium mining in Australia, and included speeches and performances by representatives of the expatriate Japanese community as well as Australia's Indigenous communities, who are concerned about the effects of uranium mining near tribal lands. There were also events in Sydney.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.voanews.com/english/news/asia/east-pacific/Australian-Rallies-Remember-Fukushima-Disaster-142242575.html |title=Australian Rallies Remember Fukushima Disaster |author=Phil Mercer |date=11 March 2012 |work=VOA News |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120312194611/http://www.voanews.com/english/news/asia/east-pacific/Australian-Rallies-Remember-Fukushima-Disaster-142242575.html |archivedate=12 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

More than 400 people joined a "Lizard's Revenge march" to the Olympic Dam site in July 2012. The anti-nuclear activists, including Elder [[Kevin Buzzacott]], protested against the mine expansion and the uranium industry. They say the company and the government have put short-term economic gain ahead of environmental and health concerns. Organiser Nectaria Calan said police harassed protesters, demanding identification and controlling access to and from their campsite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/state-politics/police-accused-over-olympic-dam-protest/story-e6frgczx-1226426656207 |title=Police accused over Olympic Dam protest  |author=Sarah Martin |date=16 July 2012 |work=The Australian }}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2012, BHP Billiton announced that the expansion was being postponed indefinitely pending investigation of a "new and cheaper design".&lt;ref name="abc.net.au"&gt;http://www.abc.net.au/news/2012-08-22/bhp-billiton-profit-falls-a-third/4215638&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, many prospective Australian uranium mines have been constrained by active antinuclear opposition, but state governments have now approved mine development in Western Australia and Queensland. But it is unlikely that any new projects will enter active development until the market improves. As of 2013 uranium prices are very low. [[Cameco]] placed the [[Kintyre]] project on hold until market prices improve and [[Paladin]] has stated that its project proposals (Bigrlyi, Angela/Pamela, Manyingee, Oobagooma, and Valhalla/Skal) need higher uranium market prices before they can proceed. [[Toro Energy|Toro]] wants to take the [[Wiluna uranium mine|Wiluna]] proposal to the development phase, but has not been successful in attracting equity investors. When market prices go up again, so that mine development is justified, most projects would need at least five years to proceed to production.&lt;ref name="Uranium supply: a troubled market"/&gt;

In 2013, Prime Minister [[Tony Abbott]] supported nuclear power, saying: "nuclear power is the only proven way of generating the base load power Australia needed without producing carbon pollution". Abbott's  Coalition’s Resources and Energy policy says "the Coalition will formalise the agreement to sell uranium to India".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.foe.org.au/sites/default/files/Chain%20Reaction%20%23119%20Nov%202013%204MB.pdf |title=Election aftermath: Full speed in reverse |author=Cam Walker |date=November 2013 |work=Chain Reaction }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016 under [[Malcolm Turnbull]], both Australian political parties opened the door for uranium exports to India,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sweeney|first1=Dave|title=Major parties push a losing uranium sector to India at great risk|url=http://www.smh.com.au/comment/major-parties-push-a-losing-uranium-sector-to-india-at-great-risk-20161128-gszld4.html|accessdate=21 April 2017|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|agency=The Sydney Morning Herald|publisher=Fairfax|date=29 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; with trade potentially starting in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bearup|first1=Greg|title=First Aussie uranium shipment to India flagged for next year|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/world/first-aussie-uranium-shipment-to-india-flagged-for-next-year/news-story/63d71c24223bd3c0890105b897f89c56|accessdate=21 April 2017|work=www.theaustralian.com.au|agency=The Australian|publisher=News Corp|date=16 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, South Australian Premier [[Jay Weatherill]] announced that a Royal Commission would be held to investigate the state's role in the nuclear fuel cycle. South Australia is currently home to four of Australia's five uranium mines, and the possibility of the state developing nuclear power generation, enrichment and waste storage facilities have previously proven to be contentious issues. The Royal Commission comes at a time of economic contraction for South Australia, which is suffering from job losses in mining and manufacturing sectors. Immediately following the announcement of the Royal Commission, emeritus Prof. [[Ian Lowe]]  suggested that the current inquiry risks retreading old ground already covered by several previous public inquiries and proposals for nuclear industrialisation. Lowe referred to the 2006 UMPNER review's finding that substantial government subsidies would be required to support nuclear industrial development in Australia, and the 1976-78 [[Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry]] (Fox Report), which drew attention to the problems of [[nuclear weapons proliferation]] and [[nuclear waste]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://theconversation.com/weve-already-had-the-nuclear-debate-why-do-it-again-37420|title = We've already had the nuclear debate: why do it again?|date = 11 February 2015|accessdate = 27 May 2015|website = The Conversation|publisher = |last = Lowe|first = Ian}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 17 April 2015, Lowe was selected as one of five members of the Nuclear Fuel Cycle Royal Commission Expert Advisory Committee.

[[File:Tilman Ruff speaks in Adelaide 2015.jpg|alt=Tilman Ruff speaks in Adelaide, 2015|thumb|Tilman Ruff AM is an Australian medical doctor who has focused on "the global health imperative to eradicate [[nuclear weapons]]".]]

The case against nuclear power and uranium mining in Australia has been concerned with the environmental, political, economic, social and cultural impacts of nuclear energy; with the shortcomings of nuclear power as an energy source; and with presenting a [[sustainable energy]] strategy. The most prominent adverse impact of nuclear power is seen to be its potential contribution towards proliferation of nuclear weapons. For example, the 1976 Ranger Inquiry report stated that "The nuclear power industry is unintentionally contributing to an increased risk of nuclear war. This is the most serious hazard associated with the industry".&lt;ref name=Martin/&gt;

The health risks associated with nuclear materials have also featured prominently in Australian anti-nuclear campaigns. This has been the case worldwide because of accidents like the [[Chernobyl disaster]], but Australian concerns have also involved specific local factors such as controversy over the health effects of [[nuclear testing]] in Australia and the South Pacific, and the emergence of prominent anti-nuclear campaigners [[Helen Caldicott]] and [[Tilman Ruff]], who are medical practitioners.

The economics of nuclear power has been a factor in anti-nuclear campaigns, with critics arguing that such power is uneconomical in Australia,&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Brian Martin (1982). Nuclear Power and the Western Australia Electricity Grid, ''Search'', Vol. 13, No. 5-6.&lt;/ref&gt; particularly given the country's abundance of coal resources.

According to the anti-nuclear movement, most of the problems with nuclear power today are much the same as in the 1970s. Nuclear reactor accidents still occur and there is no convincing solution to the problem of long-lived radioactive waste. Nuclear weapons proliferation continues to occur, notably in Pakistan and North Korea, building on facilities and expertise from civilian nuclear operations. The alternatives to nuclear power, [[efficient energy use]] and [[renewable energy]] (especially [[wind power]]), have been further [[Renewable energy commercialization|developed and commercialised]].&lt;ref name=past/&gt;

==Public opinion==
A 2009 poll conducted by the [[Uranium Information Centre]] found that Australians in the 40 to 55 years age group are the "most trenchantly opposed to nuclear power".&lt;ref name=gf/&gt; This generation was raised during the [[Cold War]], experienced the [[anti-nuclear movement]] of the 1970s, witnessed the 1979 partial meltdown of the [[Three Mile Island accident|Three Mile Island]] reactor in the USA, and the 1986 [[Chernobyl disaster]]. It was the generation which was also subject to cultural influences including feature films such as the "nuclear industry conspiracies" ''[[The China Syndrome]]'' and ''[[Silkwood]]'' and the apocalyptic ''[[Dr Strangelove]]''. Younger people are "less resistant" to the idea of [[nuclear power in Australia]].&lt;ref name=gf&gt;Strong, Geoff and  Munro, Ian (13 October 2009).

'''Atlantic Canadian English''' is a class of [[Canadian English]] dialects spoken in the [[Atlantic Canada|Atlantic provinces of Canada]] and is notably distinct from [[Standard Canadian English]].&lt;ref&gt;[[William Labov|Labov, William]]; Sharon Ash; Charles Boberg (2006). ''[[The Atlas of North American English]]''. Berlin: Mouton de Gruyter. pp. 141, 148.&lt;/ref&gt; Atlantic Canadian English comprises '''Canadian Maritime English''' and [[Newfoundland English]]. It is mostly influenced by [[British English|British]] and [[Hiberno-English|Irish English]], and some [[Acadian French]]. Atlantic Canada is the Easternmost region of Canada, comprising four provinces located on the Atlantic coast - the three [[Maritime provinces]]: [[Nova Scotia]], [[New Brunswick]], and [[Prince Edward Island]], as well as [[Newfoundland and Labrador]].&lt;ref name="Chambers 2010" /&gt; The population of the Atlantic Provinces in 2016 was about 2,300,000 on a land area of approximately half a million square kilometers&lt;ref name="Chambers 2010" /&gt;, with Nova Scotia being the most populous province, and its capital, [[Halifax Nova Scotia|Halifax]], the most populous city.

== History ==
Canadian English owes its very existence to important historical events, especially: the Treaty of Paris of 1763. English was first spoken in Canada in the 17th century, in seasonal fishing communities along the Atlantic coast, including the island of Newfoundland, and at fur trade posts around Hudson Bay.&lt;ref name="Chambers 2010" /&gt; Treated as a marker of upper-class prestige in the 19th century and the early part of the 20th, Canadian dainty was marked by the use of some features of British English pronunciation, resulting in an accent similar to the Mid-Atlantic accent known in the United States. This accent faded in prominence following World War II, when it became stigmatized as pretentious, and is now almost never heard in contemporary Canadian life outside of archival recordings used in film, television or radio documentaries.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

==Phonology==
''[[The Atlas of North American English]]'' (2006) revealed many of the sound changes active within Atlantic Canadian English, including the fronting of {{IPAc-en|ɑr}} and full [[Canadian raising]]. This means the diphthongs {{IPA|/aɪ/}} and {{IPA|/aʊ/}} are raised to, respectively, {{IPA|[ʌɪ]}} and {{IPA|[ʌʊ]}} before [[voiceless consonant]]s like {{IPA|/p/}}, {{IPA|/t/}}, {{IPA|/k/}}, {{IPA|/s/}}, {{IPA|/f/}}. In all Atlantic Canadian English, {{IPAc-en|æ}} (the "short ''a'' sound") is raised before [[nasal consonant]]s. This is strongly true in Nova Scotia's Sydney English specifically, which also features a merger of {{IPAc-en|æ|g}} and {{IPAc-en|eɪ|g}} (e.g. making ''haggle'' sound like ''Hagel'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Labov|Ash|Boberg|2006|p=182}}&lt;/ref&gt; This merger, typical of Standard Canadian English as well, is not typical however of the rest of Atlantic Canadian English. Nova's Scotia's Halifax English and New Brunswick's [[Saint John, New Brunswick|Saint John]] English show a New York City-like [[/æ/ tensing|''æ'' split]] (so ''bad'' and ''bag'' have a different vowel sound than ''bat'' and ''back'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Labov|Ash|Boberg|2006|p=182}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nova Scotia's [[Lunenburg English]] may show [[rhoticity in English|non-rhotic behaviour]].&lt;ref name="Chambers 2010"&gt;{{cite web|last=Chambers |first=Jack K. |title=English in Canada |url=http://www.queensu.ca/strathy/apps/OP6v2.pdf |accessdate=2012-07-20 |format=pdf |year=2010 |page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; An influence of [[Hiberno-English|Irish]] and [[Scottish English]] features is noticeable in [[Newfoundland English]], including a fronting of {{IPAc-en|ɑː}}~{{IPAc-en|ɒ}},&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Labov|Ash|Boberg|2006|p=89}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[cheer–chair merger]], the [[line–loin merger]], and a distinct lack of the [[Mary–marry–merry merger|marry–merry merger]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Labov|Ash|Boberg|2006|p=219}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nova Scotia English generally has a conservative {{IPAc-en|u:}} compared with other Canadian English.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Labov|Ash|Boberg|2006|p=103}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[flapping]] of intervocalic {{IPA|/t/}} and {{IPA|/d/}} to an [[alveolar tap]] {{IPA|[ɾ]}} between vowels, as well as pronouncing it as a [[glottal stop]] {{IPA|[ʔ]}}, is less common in the Maritimes than elsewhere in Canada, so that "battery" is pronounced {{IPA|[ˈbætɹi]}} instead of with a glottal stop. The varied, but similar, Maritimer accents are influenced by an overwhelming majority of early Scottish and Irish immigration namely in the regions of [[Saint John, New Brunswick|Saint John]], Miramichi, [[Cape Breton]] and parts of Halifax.

===Maritimes===

The phonology of Maritimer English has some unique features:
* Cot-caught merger in effect, but toward a central vowel {{IPA|ä}}.
* No [[Canadian Shift]] of the short [[front vowel]]s
* Pre-consonantal {{IPA|/r/}} is sometimes (though rarely) deleted.
* The flapping of intervocalic {{IPA|/t/}} and {{IPA|/d/}} to alveolar tap {{IPA|[ɾ]}} between vowels, as well as pronouncing it as a glottal stop {{IPA|[ʔ]}}, is less common in the Maritimes. Therefore, ''battery'' is pronounced {{IPA|[ˈbætɹi]}} instead of {{IPA|[ˈbæɾ(ə)ɹi]}}.
* Especially among the older generation, {{IPA|/w/}} and {{IPA|/hw/}} are not merged; that is, the beginning sound of why, white, and which is different from that of witch, with, wear.
* Like most varieties of CanE, Maritimer English contains Canadian raising.

== Canadian Raising ==
[[File:Canadian raising on a vowel chart.svg|thumb|Canadian Rising Vowel Chart]]
Canadian raising affects vowels before [[voicelessness|voiceless]] consonants like {{IPAc-en|f}}, {{IPAc-en|θ}}, {{IPAc-en|t}}, and {{IPAc-en|s}}. Vowels before voiced consonants like {{IPAc-en|v}}, {{IPAc-en|ð}}, {{IPAc-en|d}}, and {{IPAc-en|z}} are usually not raised.

Since Canadian Raising only occurs before the voiceless consonants /p/, /t/, /k/, /f/, /th/ and /s/, Canadian English distinguishes the raised and unraised vowels in pairs of words like type v. tie, write v. ride, spike v. spy, shout v. loud, south v. sound, or house v. how.

==Lexicon==

The interrogative "right?", raised to {{IPA|[ˈrʌɪt]}}, is also used as an [[adverb]], as in "It was right foggy today!". This sense may be influenced by Welsh word "reit" {{IPA|[ˈrəɪt]}},&lt;ref name="Chambers 2010" /&gt; which means "very, rather, or considerably". "Right" is often, though less today than before,{{when|date=June 2015}} used with this meaning in the [[Southern American English|American South]], too. "Some" is used as an adverb as well, especially in Nova Scotia, as in "This cake is some good!". Another example is "s'pose" or "s'poseda" for "suppose" or "supposed to". Such expressions tend to be widely used in the rural Maritimes, but are less common in urban areas.

Terminal hard consonants are often dropped from pronunciation when found in sentences.  "Ol'" rather than "old", "col'" rather than "cold", "tha'" rather than "that", "suppose'" rather than "supposed." (with the -s pronounced softly, rather than as a -z).  When it is pronounced it is softly, almost imperceptibly.

Common in New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island and Nova Scotia, but also found in downeast Maine, is aspirated speech; i.e.,"Yeah" or "No", spoken while inhaling. (colloquial pronunciation). This speech pattern bears no particular significance, other than its unusual nature. Competitive aspirated speech has been observed, with the intensity of aspiration increasing as conversation passes from one person to the next. The speaker is generally unaware of using this technique, and will frequently deny using it, when confronted. This is often referred to as a "Gaelic Gasp."&lt;ref name="Chambers 2010" /&gt;

Individual words and dialects may vary between provinces, and indeed, will vary between towns. On Prince Edward Island or Nova Scotia, "mouth" may be pronounced "mewth". In Newfoundland, "Mouth" may be pronounced as "Mout". Either province may also pronounce "Look" as simply "Luh", but only if the word was not used as part of a bigger sentence, such as pointing in a direction and saying "luh!", otherwise the letter "k" is pronounced, "Look here!". The phrase (for eating) "get it into you" is spoken quickly and almost as one word, "giggit-inta-ya". The phrase "Go away with you" (a phrase of disbelief) would be pronounced "go-way-with-ya" or "go-wee-witch-ya" spoken quickly as if all of one word. Having a big meal may be called "having a big feed" or "having a big scoff". Slang terms that would otherwise be considered insults in other parts of Canada are almost terms of endearment within Atlantic Canada; such as inquiring where "shitty-arse" is, or calling someone who works for you "my Kunta Kinti". Other examples are nearly endless.

Terms of [[British English|British]] origin are very much still a part of Maritime English, depending on dialects.  ''[[Couch|Chesterfield]],'' ''[[Living room|front room]],'' ''gob'', and ''[[parlour]]'' are examples of this.  Another is the use of the somewhat vulgar "arse" in place of the American and central and western Canadian form, "ass".   Other examples of British terms that may be heard in the rest of Canada, but less frequently than in the Maritimes, include "holiday" for vacation, "sweets" for candy, "Mum" for Mom and "cellar" for basement. Prince Edward Islanders often use more British terms than any other Maritimers, due to the overwhelming homogeneity of the province's Scottish and Irish ethnicity.&lt;ref name="Chambers 2010" /&gt;  Examples include referring to the hood of a car as an "engine bonnet" and a barn as a "byre." The latter is much more common amongst older speakers.  The arse end of a car may also be referred to as the "boot". "Go to the arse end of the car, lift the bonnet, and check inside the boot. Luh! I found the tire iron! Right where it's s'poseda be!".  Going for a "ramble" would refer to going for a long walk for pleasure.  

Truancy is often referred to as playing hookey, skipping, ditching, or jigging.  Some Maritimers, particularly Prince Edward Islanders, will describe treacherous winter roads as "slippy" rather than "slippery". Some Maritimers will also add an /s/ to the end of "somewhere" and "anywhere", producing "somewheres" and "anywheres"&lt;ref name="Chambers 2010" /&gt;

The names of meals are not always used in the same way as in other parts of the country: "dinner" may refer to the meal eaten at midday; "supper" is the evening meal; and occasionally, particularly with older speakers, "lunch" refers to a snack eaten outside of regular meal times (for example, a "bed lunch" is a bedtime snack). "Breakfast" is used for the morning meal, as it is elsewhere in Canada.

Many terms and phrases that are derived from the region's nautical background and are often shared with Britain, Ireland and New England.  Examples of this include terms such as "reef" in place of "pull" and a deckhand on a boat being referred to as a "cork." A common way to describe drunkenness is to state that someone is "three sheets to the wind," which is a phrase used to describe a ship swaying in the wind due to loose sheets (ropes) in the rigging. A "jigger" can refer to any object, "I can't change the TV channel without the jigger!" The phrase "I like the cut of your jib" (a [[jib]] is a forward sail which cuts or draws into the wind) means to understand or agree what someone is talking about in a conversation, or to approve of ones actions. It is not uncommon to hear one use the word "downstream" to refer to any location being a distance or direction to head to; such as "Im heading downstream into town". The word "Landed" (a boat landing on shore) can refer to arriving at a location by any means; "I landed at my neighbours house last night".

== Spelling ==
[[File:International English Spelling.png|thumb|International English Spelling Chart]]
Canadian English shows a more balanced mixture of American and British standards is spelling.
* Words such as ''real'''ize''''' and ''paral'''yze''''' are usually spelled with ''-ize'' or ''-yze'' rather than ''-ise'' or ''-yse''. (The etymological convention that verbs derived from [[Greek language|Greek]] roots are spelled with -ize and those from [[Latin]] with -ise is preserved in that practice.&lt;ref&gt;Sir Ernest Gowers, ed., ''Fowler's Modern English Usage'', 2nd ed. (Oxford: OUP, 1965), 314.&lt;/ref&gt;)
* French-derived words that in American English end with ''-or'' and ''-er'', such as ''col'''or''''' or ''cent'''er''''', often retain British spellings (''col'''our''''' and ''cent'''re'''''). 
* While the United States uses the Anglo-French spelling ''defen'''se''''' and ''offen'''se''''' (noun), most Canadians use the British spellings ''defen'''ce''''' and ''offen'''ce'''''. (Note that ''defen'''sive''''' and ''offen'''sive''''' are universal.)
* Some nouns, as in British English, take ''-ice'' while matching verbs take ''-ise''&amp;nbsp;– for example, ''pract'''ice''''' and ''licen'''ce''''' are nouns while ''pract'''ise''''' and ''licen'''se''''' are the respective corresponding verbs. (Note that ''adv'''ice''''' and ''adv'''ise''''' are universal across all forms of English in this respect.)

The '''Barnim Panorama''', owned by the [[municipality]] [[Wandlitz]], was created in September 2013 by combining the Agrarmuseum Wandlitz and the [[visitor center]] of the [[Barnim Nature Park]]. It has the largest [[Agriculture|agricultural]] collection in [[Brandenburg]] and offers six themed rooms to give visitors an insight into the 200-year-old history of agriculture in Brandenburg. The museum in the [[Quarter (urban subdivision)|quarter]] Wandlitz was built in 1955 and could only use provisional arrangements until 2013. Because of the growing demand for more exhibition space and better opportunities to present its collection, the quarter decided to construct a new building across the street from the original museum.

== Founding of the museum ==

In 1955 the [[Heimatforscher]] (somebody researching his homeland, home town or region) and owner of the [[Meierhof]] Walter Blankenburg (1901-1984) from Wandlitz opened the so-called “Heimatstube”. He and his wife Margot had been collecting various commonly used items from rural households with the help of other residents over the course of several years that could now be shown for the first time raising a lot of public interest. Over time and with public funding the “Heimatstube” was expanded into a museum by repurposing two [[barn]]s, a [[stable]], and a 5,381 square foot (500m²) large auditorium gifted by the [[Free German Trade Union Federation]] was added to cope with the fast growing collection, now largely consisting of agricultural equipment and machinery. The museum staff was supported on an academic level by the [[Berlin State Museums]].

In 1975 the museum was renamed to "Museum der agraren Produktivkräfte"&lt;ref&gt;Museum der agraren Produktivkräfte, ... p.&amp;nbsp;1/2.&lt;/ref&gt; (approximate translation: Museum of the Agricultural Workforce).

The sculpture, created by [[Walter Arnold (sculptor)|Walter Arnold]], positioned in front of the multi-purpose building in the 1980s was a long-time loan to the museum from a museum in Berlin. The sculpture was given back to its original museum in Berlin in 2011.

== Agricultural Museum Wandlitz (from 1990) ==

After the [[German reunification]] the museum would continue to exist with the financial support of the [[municipality]] Wandlitz and a newly founded [[booster club]]. In 1990 the state [[Brandenburg]] changed the museum’s name to “Agrarmuseum Wandlitz” (Agricultural Museum Wandlitz). Throughout the following years its collection has become the biggest, historic agricultural collection in Brandenburg. Until spring 2013 the total exhibition space was about 21,571 square foot (2000m²) large. One of the most noticeable exhibits is the historic “Dampfpflug” (a [[plough]] working with a steam engine), which was situated outside the museum under a separate roof. Many functional [[tractors]] and other agricultural machinery from different eras can be seen at the museum. In other areas of the exhibition, traditional [[craft]] and the historic rural household are portrayed. The exhibits of the “Heimatstube” give special insight into the history of the village and its residents.

The museum once owned a farm in the village, where different kind of potatoes were grown.&lt;ref&gt;''Government gazette of the municipality Wandlitz'' Juli 15, 2006; Picture of the museum's curator Christine Papendiek standing on the farm.&lt;/ref&gt;

The museum is financed only by the municipality Wandlitz.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.barnim-panorama.de/ueber-uns.html "About us" section of the Barnim Panorama website] (in German), Retrieved July 25, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

== New buildings and names ==
The museum had planned a new building which would replace the run-down architecture of the old one, and for a long time the museum could not build it, but in 2011 those plans were realized. In close proximity to the old museum, the [[municipality]] Wandlitz started the construction of a new complex of buildings, known as the Barnim Panorama, which would house the “Agrarmuseum Wandlitz” (Agricultural Museum Wandlitz), as well as the visitor center of the [[Barnim Nature Park]].

A foundation stone ceremony for the Barnim Panorama was held during the annual museum festival on May 15, 2011. The new complex of buildings has the same appearance as the rest of the villages’ stables, barns, and the main building, which is made from stone. The building also resembles a historic “Dreiseithof” (a square farm complex that has buildings on three of its sides). The neighboring landmarked school was integrated into the complex of buildings that form the Barnim Panorama, which is now the new headquarter of the [[Barnim Nature Park]], and provides offices for the management of the museum.

The architects of "Reese Lubic Woehrlin" from [[Prenzlauer Berg|Berlin-Prenzlauer Berg]] won the architectural design competition, and designed the new museum.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lubic-woehrlin.de/ Homepage of R-L-W with visualization of new Building] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120219150347/http://www.lubic-woehrlin.de/ |date=February 19, 2012 }} (in German), Retrieved July 25, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; In total the project cost an estimated 6.2 million €, including approximately 5 million € for the construction. The [[European Union]] and the state [[Brandenburg]] contributed with 3.7 million € in [[Subsidy|subsidies]].&lt;ref name="MOZ1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Government gazette of the municipality Wandlitz May 28, 2011: ''Grundstein für neues Besucherzentrum gelegt. Agrarmuseum und Naturpark Barnim ab 2013 unter einem Dach.'', p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mlul.brandenburg.de/cms/detail.php/bb1.c.303901.de Ministerium für Ländliche Entwicklung, Umwelt und Landwirtschaft des Landes Brandenburg]{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} (in German), Retrieved July 25, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 local residents suggested naming the new museum after its founder Walter Blankenburg. The Cultural Affairs Director of the municipality then drafted a resolution to name the Barnim Panorama “Walter-Blankenburg-Hof” (Walter-Blankenburg-Farm), but the booster club of the museum denied the resolution because the lot was not owned by the Blankenburg family. Instead, the booster club wanted to name the whole plaza after Walter Blankenburg. Finally the municipality Wandlitz decided to name a street after Walter Blankenburg: the "Walter-Blankenburg-Weg".&lt;ref&gt;Sabine Rakitin: ''[http://www.moz.de/heimat/lokalredaktionen/eberswalde/buergerbildungszentrum/artikelansicht/dg/0/1/1038065/ Wandlitz streitet um Ehrung für Museumsgründer] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131108224005/http://www.moz.de/heimat/lokalredaktionen/eberswalde/buergerbildungszentrum/artikelansicht/dg/0/1/1038065/ |date=November 8, 2013 }}'' In: ''Märkische Oderzeitung'', 18.

The Barnim Panorama was officially opened on September 7, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moz.de/galerie/uebersicht/g3/236657/ ''Eröffnung Barnim Panorama''] with many pictures (in German), Retrieved July 25, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; The Brandenburg Department of Construction awarded Stefan Woehrlin’s team of architects with the “Baukulturpreis” (an award from the state of Brandenburg for architects and civil engineers) on October 12, 2013. The reasons for giving the award to Stefan Woehrlin’s team especially underlined their predominant use of environmentally sustainable construction materials, and the design towards building a [[low-energy house]] with zero emissions. The awarded money of 2,500 € was gifted to the booster club and the [[Barnim Nature Park]] by the architects.&lt;ref&gt;''Preis für Barnim Panorama'' from the newspaper ''Der Blitz'' October 26/27, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

What is especially notable are the walk-on-able map of the local area, and the large outside area with a lot of space for children to play in. The tractor collection is inside an exhibit hall made mostly from glass. Other exhibit objects were rearranged in the new museum.

The whole new building complex provides [[Universal design|universal access]].

== Exhibition ==

The complete former museum now uses three stories of the new building, and the whole exposition is unified under the motto “Geformte und genutzte Landschaft” (Shaped and Formed Landscape). The foyer, a shop, as well as the exhibits “Wild Barnim” (a multimedia installation from fall 2014), “Moving Soil”, and the “Tractor herd” are situated on the bottom floor. Visitors will also find the exit to the garden and a depot containing various [[combine harvesters]] on the bottom floor. On the upper floor there are two major topics presented: “Stories from the Barnim,” and “Rural Life.” A portion of the available space is reserved only for special exhibits. Lastly there is a panoramic window that gives the visitors a view upon the [[Wandlitzer See]] (lake), and a walk-on-able map of the [[Barnim Nature Park]] which simulates a [[Birds-eye view|bird’s-eye view]].&lt;ref&gt;Flyer ''Natur und Technik erleben.'' summer 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Barnim Panorama is open every day (except Friday) from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. The admission fee for adults is 6 € with lower prices for children, families, and groups.

== Exhibits (Selection) ==

=== Wild Barnim ===

This modern media presentation was created after a limited competition held by the ''“Bärlin Team Eventdesign”'' corporation, and produced in cooperation with the filmmakers ''“filmfritzen.tv”''. An infinitely looped movie is projected onto a 45 x 10 foot (14 x 3 m) large, curved surface. It shows the shaping of the Barnim landscape in impressive images. Seven different scenes are shown without the use of a commentator but rather with the sounds of nature and other self-composed sound effects. It aims to teach visitors about the Ice Age and the following melting of the glaciers as well as the adjacent formation of lakes, forests, and swamps. The multimedia installation is rounded off by special coordinated light effects.&lt;ref&gt;Government gazette of the municipality Wandlitz Issue 11/2014, p. 18: ''Den Schlussstein setzen''&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Special exhibitions ===
2014 - 2015: '''''Out into the Nature''''' (from the German: ''“Raus ins Grüne”'') deals with the early tourism in the region at the beginning of the 20th century. It especially highlights the influence of the rail road “[[Heidekrautbahn]]”, the [[Liepnitzsee]] (lake), and the [[Wandlitzer See]] (lake) as catalysts for the tourism boom that is still noticeable today.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20150511125452/http://www.barnim-panorama.de/museum-garten/aktuelle-sonderausstellung.html Archive of the homepage of the museum with information about the special exhibition "Out into the Nature"] (in German), Retrieved June 20, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

2015 - 2016: '''''Wolf and Human – Searching for Traces in Brandenburg''''' (from the German ''“Wolf und Mensch – auf Spurensuche in Brandenburg”'') The once very dense wolf [[population]] in [[Brandenburg]] was for the last 200 years almost nonexistent. But as the wolf population is starting to grow again and the animals are returning to their historic habitat, many questions arise about how humans and wolves can live together peacefully. The exhibition shows both historic and current aspects of their relationship and aims to provide a platform for the current public discussion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.barnim-panorama.de/images/angebote-service/NaturparkBarnim_WolfMensch_2015_web.pdf Flyer for the wolf exhibition] (in German), Retrieved March 9, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20151013021746/http://www.barnim-panorama.de/museum-garten/aktuelle-sonderausstellung.html Archive of the homepage of the museum with information about the special exhibition "Wolf and Human"] (in German), Retrieved June 20, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

2016: '''''Waldsiedlung Wandlitz - A Landscape of Power''''' (from the German ''“Waldsiedlung Wandlitz - Eine Landschaft der Macht”'') aims to give an [[Historical criticism|historical-critical]] overview of the [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|SED]] history of the housing-complex used by the political leadership of the [[East Germany|German Democratic Republic]] from 1958 to 1990.

Visitors are getting insight into the day-to-day life of the SED officials, their families, and their security staff living inside the locked off complex. The exhibition asks about the impact of the housing-complex on the region and provides a geopraphical overview on its large walk-on-able map. It also highlights the connections between the growing media coverage of the housing-complex in the last years of the German Democratic Republic to the [[Peaceful Revolution]] of 1989. The exhibition is accompanied by multiple informative installations on the area of the former housing complex.

It was funded by the state [[Brandenburg]] and the [[Federal Foundation for the Reappraisal of the SED Dictatorship]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.barnim-panorama.de/museum-garten/aktuelle-sonderausstellung/waldsiedlung-wandlitz.html homepage of the museum with information about the special exhibition "Waldsielung Wandlitz - A Landscape of Power"] (in German), Retrieved November 30, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Events ==

The first museum festival took place in 1979. It was celebrated with live music and a parade of all the exhibits, that were still in tact. The festival became an annual event that takes place in May and offers insight into traditional craft and presentations of special items from the museum’s collection to up to 2,500 visitors in the historic center of the [[quarter (urban subdivision)|quarter]] Wandlitz. Many small [[artisans]], [[Artisan|craftsmen]], and [[artists]], as well as [[voluntary associations]] participate in the festival.&lt;ref name="ABW 7-09"&gt;Government gazette of the municipality Wandlitz June 27, 2009 p. 21: ''Ländliches Leben heute und gestern. Eine runde Sache: 30 Jahre Museumsfest, 10 Jahre Naturpark Barnim''&lt;/ref&gt;

Since approximately 1983, annual summer concerts invite visitors to experience the museum in a different way.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.barnim-panorama.de/images/angebote-service/Barnim_Panorama_MiM_2016_web_2.pdf Flyer for the summer concerts in 2016] (in German), Retrieved June 20, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Musicians play at the museum on four different dates between June and September inside a scenic installation in the museum. In July, 2009, for example, melodies from [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]] and [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] could be heard by the visitors.&lt;ref name="ABW 7-09"/&gt;

'''''Beur''''' (or alternatively, '''''Rebeu''''') is a colloquial term to designate European-born people whose parents or grandparents are immigrants from [[North Africa]], more specifically [[Maghreb]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.larousse.com/en/dictionaries/french-english/beur/8912 Beur] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721205639/http://www.larousse.com/en/dictionaries/french-english/beur/8912 |date=July 21, 2011 }}. Larousse Dictionary. Accessed 2011-04-25&lt;/ref&gt; The equivalent term for a female beur is a '''beurette'''. The term ''rebeu'' is neither applicable to females nor does it have a female version.

The word beur was coined using [[verlan]] for the word ''arabe'', which means Arabic or Arab in French. Since the late 1990s, a lot of young people have used the twice-[[verlan]]ised term ''rebeu'' as a synonym. This term is now the dominant term used by the younger generations (under 30). The word ''beurette'', the female version of ''beur'', is created by adding the -ette female suffix in French. In French many slang words are created by simply reversing the word in terms of spelling and then reading it out. Because of French grammar rules, the new word is usually completely different than reversing the word phonetically. The word ''[[beurgeois]]'' is derived from a combination of the words ''beur'' and ''[[Bourgeoisie|bourgeois]]''.

The term is slightly familiar and not advised in formal speech with respect to [[etiquette]] though it will be used in the media. The term ''beur'' is used to refer to all the [[Arabs]] from either [[Maghreb]] or [[Mashreq]] areas of the [[Arab world]] born in [[France]].

The term ''beur'' is of French origin, and as such was traditionally mostly used in French-speaking European countries such as France (where the term originates), Belgium, Monaco, Luxembourg and Switzerland, as well as in North Africa. Due to cultural integration between such peoples across Europe, the term is now popular in other parts of Europe with a large North African community, such as the UK, Spain, the Netherlands and Italy.

Someone who is a North African from Europe is not necessarily a ''beur'': the term is applied to those who have a hybrid culture between their North African roots and their status as someone who was born and raised in Europe. There is a big difference between a French Moroccan and a ''beur'', for instance. There is a strong identity and solidarity between these people that exists irrespective of which North African country one comes from, nor the European country they were raised in: a French Algerian will see another French Algerian as they would a French Moroccan, a Belgium Moroccan or a Belgian Algerian. The term can apply to people of any race or religion, such as [[North African Arabs|Arabs]], [[Berbers]], [[Pied-Noir]] or [[Moroccan Jews|Jews]] or even [[Black people|Blacks]] who originate from North Africa.

Since 1992, the [[Beur FM|BEUR.FM]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beurfm.net/ BEUR.FM]. Accessed 201-01-11&lt;/ref&gt; radio station has broadcast nationwide (106.7 [[FM broadcast band|FM]] in [[Paris]]). It specializes in  North African Arab music and other genres (funk, rap, ... ) discussion, and news.

[[Julia Gillard]], who ousted Rudd from office in June 2010, stated that she did not support Rudd's position shortly after taking over on the grounds that a "big Australia" would be unsustainable.&lt;ref&gt;

The omission of population targets from the 2011 Sustainable Population Strategy doesn’t mean they didn’t exist. In effect, the Strategy took as read the near doubling of Net Overseas Migration (NOM) implemented in the closing years of the Howard Government. 

The official population policies and targets continued to be published elsewhere.  Treasury Budget Paper No. 3 of 2011 “assumes” Net Overseas Migration (NOM) of 175,000 plus, with population growth on 1.5 per cent. The 2015 Intergenerational Report makes similar or even higher assumptions about migration and population growth than that of 2010, leading to a population of nearly 40 million by 2054-55.  Under Coalition Government, Budget Paper No. 3 of 2018 “assumes” 230,000 plus for NOM and population growth of 1.6 per cent. This is one of the highest percentages in the OECD.  

Demographic projections released by the [[Queensland Centre for Population Research]] in 2011 found that there is a 50 per cent likelihood of Australia's population being larger than 35 million by 2050.&lt;ref name="Even Bigger Australia" /&gt;

Cannabis is known as "matekoane" in [[Sesotho language]].&lt;ref name="LabrousseLaniel2013"/&gt;

==History==
Cannabis use dates back to at least the 16th century in Lesotho, when the [[Koena people]] traded cannabis to the local [[San tribe]]s in exchange for land around 1550. By the 19th century, cannabis was a staple crop in the kingdom.&lt;ref name="LabrousseLaniel2013"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Alain Labrousse|author2=Laurent Laniel|title=The World Geopolitics of Drugs, 1998/1999|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x2kcBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA246|date=29 June 2013|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-94-017-3505-6|pages=246–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultivation==
Cannabis is cultivated almost everywhere in Lesotho, including the capital, but the primary cultivation is in the central mountain zones and western foothills.&lt;ref name="LabrousseLaniel2013"/&gt;

===Medical cannabis===
In 2017, the Lesotho Ministry of Health licensed a South African firm to grow cannabis in Lesotho for medical and scientific purposes, the first such authorized establishment in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.okayafrica.com/lesotho-granted-first-legal-marijuana-license-africa/ Lesotho Just Granted Africa's First Legal Marijuana License - OkayAfrica&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2017/early 2018, the Lesotho government licensed 5 companies to produce medical marijuana.  Three of these companies have been partially, or entirely acquired by established licensed Canadian producers: 

* Verve Dynamics - roughly 30% ownership by Aphria (Canada)&lt;ref&gt;https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/aphria-forms-landmark-venture-with-south-african-company-verve-group-of-companies-683849711.html&lt;/ref&gt;
* MediGrow Lesotho - 10% acquired by Supreme Cannabis (Canada)&lt;ref&gt;https://mjbizdaily.com/lesotho-attracts-another-major-medical-cannabis-investment/&lt;/ref&gt;
* Daddy-Cann - 100% acquired by Canopy Growth (Canada)&lt;ref&gt;https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/canopy-growth-corporation-announces-entry-into-the-african-market-with-acquisition-of-daddy-cann-lesotho-684037281.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Enforcement==
In one joint South African-Lesotho operation in 2006, 47 tons of cannabis were seized.&lt;ref name="Board2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=United Nations: International Narcotics Control Board|title=Report of the International Narcotics Control Board 2006|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qGjTNqElWJoC&amp;pg=PA38|date=1 February 2007|publisher=United Nations Publications|isbn=978-92-1-148218-8|pages=38–}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cultivation is for the most part tolerated, however, due to the high rate of poverty in the nation and the economic benefits that the cannabis trade provides.&lt;ref name="sensi"&gt;{{cite web |title=Cannabis in Lesotho |url=https://sensiseeds.com/en/blog/cannabis-lesotho-en/ |website=Sensi Seeds |accessdate=2 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legislation==
In 2001, Lesotho drafted the [[Drugs of Abuse Bill]], which brought Lesotho into line with numerous international drugs law standards, including the 1961 [[Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs]].&lt;ref name="Newman2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Graeme R.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8113">The '''Philippine census of population and housing''' is a regularly occurring and official inventory of the [[human]] population as well as housing units in the [[Philippines]]. The population is enumerated every 5 years (beginning on 1970, except in 2005 where it was moved to 2007 due to budgetary constraints) and the results are used to allocate Congressional seats (congressional apportionment) and government program funding.  

By virtue of Republic Act No. 10625 known as the Philippine Statistical Act of 2013,  censuses in the Philippines are administered by the [[Philippine Statistics Authority]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lawphil.net/statutes/repacts/ra2013/ra_10625_2013.html|title=Republic Act  No. 10625|website=www.lawphil.net|access-date=2017-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==History==
The first census in the Philippines in 1591, was based on tributes collected and yielded about 666,712 people in the islands. In 1799, Friar Manuel Buzeta estimated the population count as 1,502,574. However, the first official census in the Philippines was carried out by the [[Spain|Spanish]] government pursuant to a royal decree calling for the counting of persons living as of the midnight of December 31, 1877. Based on this census, the Philippines had a population of 5,567,685 as of the reference date.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://psa.gov.ph/statistics/census/2015-census-of-population|title=Census of Population {{!}} Philippine Statistics Authority|website=psa.gov.ph|language=en|access-date=2017-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by another censuses, the 1887 census that yielded a count of 5,984,727,&lt;ref name=TroiGawpo&gt;

The first census conducted by the U.S. military forces took place in 1903 to fulfill Public Act 467 which was approved by the United States Philippine Commission on October 6, 1902.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

A four-volume description of this census was on hand some years ago at the National Archives in San Bruno, California, but the volumes appear to have since been misplaced.

==Statistics==
For years between the censuses, the Philippine Statistics Authority issues estimates made using surveys and statistical systems. 

Based on the population census in 2015, the national population is 100,981,437 as of August 1, 2015. From 2010 to 2015, the population grew by 1.72% per year on the average.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.psa.gov.ph/content/highlights-philippine-population-2015-census-population|title=Highlights of the Philippine Population  2015 Census of Population {{!}} Philippine Statistics Authority|website=www.psa.gov.ph|language=en|access-date=2017-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Santos said the Philippines’ population expanded from 1960 to 1970 at an annual rate of 3.01 percent. This slowed to 2.75 percent for the decade from 1970 to 1980, and further to 2.34 percent from 1990 to 2000.

From 2001 to 2006, the Philippine population growth rate was similar to Malaysia with an average 2 per cent growth rate; but higher than Vietnam, 1.4 percent from 2001 to 2006; Indonesia, 1.3 percent; and Thailand, 0.8 percent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dbm.gov.ph/index.php?pid=3&amp;nid=1044] Manila Times&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;2007 Census Results CD-ROM, DISDiv NSO, Manila&lt;/ref&gt;

The next census is scheduled for the year 2020.

A '''courtesy name''' ({{zh|s=字}}, ''zi''), also known as a '''style name''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Chinese Medical Qigong|author=Tianjun Liu, Xiao Mei Qiang |year=2013 |page=590 |isbn=978-1848190962 |quote=Mencius (371—289 BCE), born in Zou county (Shandong province), first name Ke, style name Zi Yu, was a famous philosopher, educator, politician, and expert on the Qigong life nurturing of Confucius in the Zhanguo Period.}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a name bestowed upon one at adulthood in addition to one's given name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Origins of Chinese Names |page=142 |year=2007 |isbn=978-9812294623 |quote=In ancient times, besides having a surname and a given name, one would have a courtesy name "Zì" as well. The courtesy name was the proper form of address for an adult. On reaching 20 years of age, young men would "put on the hat" as ...}}&lt;/ref&gt; This practice is a tradition in [[East Asian cultural sphere|East Asian cultures]], including [[China]], [[Japan]], [[Korea]] and [[Vietnam]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chinaknowledge.de/History/Terms/titles.html Names of Persons and Titles of Rulers]&lt;/ref&gt;

Formerly in China, the ''zi'' would replace a male's given name when he turned twenty, as a symbol of adulthood and respect.{{citation needed|reason=Is it so in every country mentioned above? The notion of "20", "male" and "respect" also needs citation.|date=November 2013}} It could be given either by the parents or by the first personal teacher on the first day of family school. Females might substitute their given name for a ''zi'' upon marriage. One also may adopt a self-chosen courtesy name.

In China the popularity of the custom has declined to a large extent since the [[May Fourth Movement]] in 1919.{{citation needed|reason=I suppose it refers to China only.|date=November 2013}}

A courtesy name is not to be confused with an [[art name]] (''hào'', {{zh|t=號}}, [[Hangul|Korean]]: 호), another frequently mentioned term for an alternative name in Asian culture-based context. An art name is usually associated with art and is more of a [[literary name]] or a [[pseudonym]] that is more spontaneous, compared to a courtesy name.

==Usage==
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2013}}
The ''zì'', sometimes called the ''biǎozì''（表字）or "courtesy name", is a name traditionally given to Chinese males at the age of 20, marking their [[coming of age]]. It was sometimes given to females upon marriage. The practice is no longer common in modern Chinese society. According to the ''[[Book of Rites]]'', after a man reaches adulthood, it is disrespectful for others of the same generation to address him by his given name, or ''míng''. Thus, the given name was reserved for oneself and one's elders, while the '''zì''' would be used by adults of the same generation to refer to one another on formal occasions or in writing; hence the term "courtesy name".

The ''zì'' is mostly [[disyllabic]], consisting of two [[Chinese character]]s, and is usually based on the meaning of the ''míng'' or [[Chinese given name|given name]]. [[Yan Zhitui]] of the [[Northern Qi]] dynasty believed that while the purpose of the ''míng'' was to distinguish one person from another, he asserted that the ''zì'' should express the bearer's moral integrity.

The relation which often exists between a person's ''zì'' and ''míng'' may be seen in the case of [[Chiang Kai-shek]] (蔣介石), whose ''ming'' was Zhōngzhèng (中正，[[romanized]] as Chung-cheng) and ''zi'' was Jieshi (介石，romanized as Kai-shek). Thus he was also called 蔣中正 (Chiang Chung-cheng) in some contexts.{{clarify|date=May 2015}}

Another way to form a ''zì'' is to use the homophonic character ''zǐ'' (子) – a respectful title for a male – as the first character of the disyllabic ''zì''. Thus, for example, [[Gongsun Qiao]]'s ''zì'' was Zǐchǎn (子產), and [[Du Fu]]'s: Zǐměi (子美).

It is also common to construct a ''zì'' by using as the first character one which expresses the bearer's birth order among male siblings in his family. Thus [[Confucius]], whose name was Kǒng Qiū (孔丘), was given the ''zì'' Zhòngní (仲尼), where the first character ''zhòng'' indicates that he was the second son born into his family. The characters commonly used are bó (伯) for the first, zhòng (仲) for the second, shū (叔) for the third, and jì (季) typically for the youngest, if the family consists of more than three sons. General [[Sun Jian]]'s four sons, for instance, were [[Sun Ce]] (伯符, Bófú), [[Sun Quan]] (仲謀, Zhòngmóu), [[Sun Yi]] (叔弼, Shūbì) and [[Sun Kuang]] (季佐, Jìzuǒ).

The use of ''zì'' began during the [[Shang dynasty]], and slowly developed into a system which became most widespread during the succeeding [[Zhou dynasty]]. During this period, women were also given ''zì''. The ''zì'' given to a woman was generally composed of a character indicating her birth order among female siblings and her surname. For example, Mèng Jiāng (孟姜) was the eldest daughter in the Jiāng family.

Prior to the twentieth century, [[sinicization|sinicize]]d [[Korea]]ns, [[Vietnam]]ese, and [[Japan]]ese were also referred to by their ''zì''. The practice was also adopted by some [[Mongols]] and [[Manchus]] after the Qing conquest of China.

'''DontDateHimGirl.com''' is a [[website]] launched in July 2005. It originally hosted anonymously submitted relationship stories about cheating partners. In 2010, the website said it was removing the "database of alleged cads" and currently hosts dating advice and tips.

In an article in ''[[The New York Times]]'', the site's founder Tasha Joseph likened it to a "dating credit report" for women.&lt;ref name="name_here"&gt;{{cite news | title=(Name Here) Is a Liar and a Cheat | last=Alvarez|first=Lizette | date= February 16, 2006 | work = The New York Times | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/16/fashion/thursdaystyles/16WEB.html|accessdate= March 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DontDateHimGirl.com was founded in 2005 by Tasha Joseph. Members were able to post anonymous reviews and photographs of cheating men to the site. When asked about the accuracy of reviews, Joseph said that the website terms and conditions required posted content to be true, and said that men could also join the website to respond to messages.&lt;ref name="cheating men" /&gt;

In July 2010, the site issued a [[press release]] that it would be removing the "database of alleged cads" to refocus on "putting out quality content such as articles, videos and podcasts that help women learn to date better, forming content partnerships and creating engaging mobile platforms".&lt;ref name=BWPR&gt;{{cite press release | title=DontDateHimGirl.com Set to Remove Postings of Alleged Cheaters from Site in 30 Days|publisher= [[Business Wire]] | date=July 19, 2010| url=http://eon.businesswire.com/portal/site/eon/permalink/?ndmViewId=news_view&amp;newsId=20100719006160&amp;newsLang=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of July 2011, much of the database was still available to be accessed, but as of February 2016 the database has been removed.

==Controversies==
The site has received criticism as a "[[reputation management]] system" which provides a venue for anonymously posting false, malicious or fraudulent profiles of men without an adequate means to correct them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Reputation Management Systems, Like 'Don't Date Him Girl' Have Several Flaws to Work Out|url=http://www.onlinedatingmagazine.com/columns/industry/09-reputationmanagement.html|publisher=OnlineDatingMagazine.com|last=Tracey|first=Joe|accessdate= March 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A September 2006 article in the ''[[Miami New Times]]'' elaborated on a fabricated profile created to demonstrate that the "website is dangerous".&lt;ref name=MNT&gt;{{cite news|title=Blind Date, Tasha Joseph's Website Shows Fiction Is Stranger Than Truth|last=Green|first=Joanne| work = [[Miami New Times]]|url=http://www.miaminewtimes.com/2006-09-14/news/blind-date/1/|date=September 14, 2006|accessdate= March 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''New Times'' investigated a number of profiles and found claims made were on the whole, fallacious. One profile the ''New Times'' uncovered supposedly of a philandering ex-boyfriend was actually a gay man who had spurned a woman's advances.

In an August 2007 feature, [[ABC News]] referred to DontDateHimGirl as a "revenge site".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Internet Revenge Sites Challenge the Theory 'No Press Is Bad Press'|url=http://abcnews.go.com/icaught/Story?id=3452908&amp;page=1|publisher= [[ABC News]] |date= August 8, 2007 |accessdate= March 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the same day, ''[[The O'Reilly Factor]]'' referenced DontDateHimGirl as a "hate site".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|title=The O'Reilly Factor|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ih0wsMBtJc|publisher= [[Fox News Channel]] |date= August 8, 2007|medium=television production|people= [[Bill O'Reilly (political commentator)|O'Reilly, Bill]] (host); [[Mary Katharine Ham|Ham, Mary Katharine]] (guest)|accessdate= May 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While it was announced in July 2010 that the profiles of the men on the site would be removed, as of June 2011, the database could still be accessed through the site's "posts" directory which are linked extensively on other websites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=DontDateHimGirl.com|title=Start of Database Posts|accessdate=June 3, 2011|url=http://www.dontdatehimgirl.com/posts/63/|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120730190650/http://www.dontdatehimgirl.com/posts/63/|archivedate=July 30, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DontDateHimGirl.com/posts/ Google links|url=http://www.google.com/search?q=%22dontdatehimgirl.com%2Fposts%2F%22|publisher= [[Google Search]] |accessdate= June 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, on an unknown date consequent to this, the database was removed as promised and as of February 2016 is not accessible.

'''Earl Pearly Paulk, Jr.''' (May 30, 1927 – March 29, 2009) was the founder of the Cathedral at Chapel Hill, a [[charismatic movement|charismatic]]/[[Pentecostal]] [[megachurch]] in [[Decatur, Georgia]], a suburb of [[Atlanta]]. Noted as "one of the country’s first great independent megachurches", it gained an international reputation for combining [[liturgical]] arts, such as [[dance]] and [[drama]], with [[:wikt:cutting edge|cutting edge]] [[Wiktionary:social ministry|social ministry]].&lt;ref name="one"/&gt;  He was also known for his lifelong crusade against [[racism]].

Paulk's reputation was severely tarnished in his later years by allegations of sexual misconduct, including several illicit relationships and accusations that he had molested children.

==Early life and training==
Paulk was born on May 30, 1927, in [[Appling County, Georgia]], near [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]], to Earl Pearly Paulk, Sr. and Addie Mae Tomberlin Paulk.  His father was a minister in the [[Church of God (Cleveland, Tennessee)]], eventually rising to assistant general overseer of the denomination. At 17, Paulk said he received a call from God to enter ministry.

Paulk graduated from [[Furman University]] in [[Greenville, South Carolina]] in the 1940s,&lt;ref name="NYTObituary"&gt;Weber, Bruce. [https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/04/us/04paulk.html Earl Paulk, Founder of a Megachurch, Is Dead at 81].  ''[[The New York Times]]'', 2009-04-04.&lt;/ref&gt; and earned his divinity degree from [[Emory University]]'s [[Candler School of Theology]], becoming the first Pentecostal to attend the historically [[United Methodist Church|Methodist]] [[seminary]]. While at Candler, he married Norma Davis, a girl who had attended his father's church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sites.silaspartners.com/CC_Content_Page/0,,PTID303846%7CCHID544974%7CCIID,00.html|title=Bishop Earl Paulk - CathedralOnline.tv|publisher=|accessdate=15 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Civil rights work==
While attending Furman, Paulk served as an associate pastor at his father's church in Greenville.&lt;ref name="NYTObituary"/&gt;  While at Candler, he was called to his first pulpit, a Church of God in [[Buford, Georgia]]; north of Atlanta.  It was during this time that he began preaching against racism.  Years later, he said that he was influenced by seeing his uncle shoot a black friend in the back for cutting corners while plowing [[cotton]].  Paulk's stance was not typical for his time; it had long been common for white Southern preachers to use the Bible to justify support for racial bars.&lt;ref name="Pete"&gt;Pete, Revé M.  [http://www.revempete.us/research/holiness/legacy.html The Impact of Holiness Preaching as Taught by John Wesley and the Outpouring of the Holy Ghost on Racism].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1952, Paulk was named pastor of Hemphill Avenue Church of God (now Mount Paran Church of God) in Atlanta just as the [[civil rights movement]] was getting underway. He was one of the few white pastors who marched with [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]]  Not long after taking over at Hemphill, Paulk became a member of "Concerned Clergy," an interracial group of Atlanta pastors who opposed [[racial segregation]].  The group was led by King's father, [[Martin Luther King, Sr.]], and met in the basement of the elder King's church, Ebenezer Baptist Church.  During this time, he served on a committee that observed Georgia's then-segregated schools, and determined that "[[separate but equal]]" was a fiction.&lt;ref name="Pete"/&gt;

Earl Paulk said that he signed ''[[The Atlanta Manifesto|The Atlanta Ministers' Manifesto]]'', a statement prepared in the fall of 1957 by a group of 80 clergymen in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], relating specifically to the violence in [[Little Rock]], [[Arkansas]], and in general to issues of [[racial integration]] from the point of view of [[Christian]] [[social responsibility]].,&lt;ref&gt;Copy available through ''Theology Today'', published by [[Princeton Theological Seminary]] in [[Princeton, New Jersey]].&lt;/ref&gt; but examination of that document does not include Earl Paulk's signature. His name does, however, appear in the second Ministers' Manifesto of 1958.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Manifesto Signers|last=|first=|date=23 Nov 1958|work=The Atlanta Journal and the Atlanta Constitution|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paulk resigned from Hemphill in 1960.  Officially, it was due to differences of opinion with Church of God leaders regarding his stance on racial integration, as well as the fact he allowed women in his church to wear [[jewelry]] (at the time, the Church of God, like many Pentecostal denominations, strongly admonished women against wearing makeup or jewelry).  However, it later emerged that he'd had an extramarital affair with a woman in his church.

==Church &amp; Ministry==
In 1960, Paulk founded the Gospel Harvesters Evangelistic Association with his wife, his brother Don (also a former Church of God pastor), and his sister-in-law Clariece.  During its early years, the church held services at St. John's Lutheran Church in the [[Little Five Points]] section of Atlanta.&lt;ref name="Pete"/&gt;  It later moved to its own building in nearby [[Inman Park]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.religionnewsblog.com/19934/earl-paulk-3 Earl Paulk timeline].  [[Atlanta Journal-Constitution]], 2007-11-20.&lt;/ref&gt;

From the first day, Paulk was committed to opening the doors of his church to all people, regardless of racial or economic background.  Not surprisingly given his opposition to segregation, he was one of the first white pastors to open the doors of his church to blacks.  This stance wasn't popular even with some members of his own church; when the first blacks set foot in the church in the early 1960s, several whites walked out in protest.  In response, one of the whites who remained, Ida Williams, gave a 15-minute sermon in which she said, "It is not the will of God that we should have prejudice."&lt;ref name="Pete"/&gt;  To this day, the church has a fairly large black membership for a church led by a white pastor.

Paulk remained active in the civil rights movement during this time.  For instance, at a meeting of Concerned Clergy, he was one of the pastors who blessed the first [[Selma to Montgomery marches|civil rights march]] in [[Selma, Alabama]].  Later, he and his brother picketed a produce market which sold food to blacks at inflated prices.  The resulting public outcry caused the store's closure.&lt;ref name="Pete"/&gt;

In 1972, the church moved to the southern part of [[DeKalb County, Georgia|DeKalb County]] and became known as Chapel Hill Harvester Church. While there, the church experienced massive growth, enlarging the building several times, having services in a tent, then moving its services into a building known as the "K-Center."  In 1989, the church broke ground on a large, [[Gothic Architecture|Gothic]]-like building off [[Interstate 285 (Georgia)|Interstate 285]] in Decatur.  Dedicated in 1991, this building was known as the "Cathedral of the Holy Spirit," and eventually the church changed its name to "the Cathedral at Chapel Hill."

The church was famed for combining visual arts (particularly with the dance team) with a [[liturgy|liturgical]] style. Under his sister Clariece, who headed the church's arts ministry for many years, it became known for its music ministry as well.  Paulk, who had previous television and radio ministry experience, later expanded his media ministry and for many years his show aired on [[Trinity Broadcasting Network|TBN]]. He also was a semi-regular guest on TBN's "Praise the Lord."

In 1982, Paulk was ordained as a bishop in the International Communion of Charismatic Churches. His public housing ministry was named one of a "[[thousand points of light]]" by President [[George H. W. Bush]].&lt;ref name="one"/&gt;  He ultimately gave up the senior pastor's title to his brother Don, but was still acknowledged as the real power.

In later years, he became one of the few mainstream Pentecostal/charismatic leaders to welcome openly gay and lesbian members.&lt;ref name="highbeam.com"&gt;http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-11306009.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Paulk's church population numbers exploded during the 1990s; at its height it had 12,000 members. Recent scandals and changes in doctrine (see below) have significantly diminished its numbers; as of 2018 it has barely 100 members.

In August 2009, with the church property facing foreclosure, the campus was sold to another local growing church;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ajc.com/news/local/huge-church-founded-earl-paulk-sells-for/dpJvwTXp96GYPJyT80H9jN/|title=Huge church founded by Earl Paulk sells for $17.6M|last=Stafford|first=Leon|website=ajc|access-date=2017-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; who then allowed Chapel Hill to use their old sanctuary.  In 2012, it changed its name to Spirit and Truth Sanctuary, and moved their heretical ministry&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://imspeakingtruth.wordpress.com/2008/06/19/the-mind-of-de-paulk/|title=A Closer Look Into The Mind Of Neph-son Donnie Earl Paulk|date=2008-06-19|work=I'm Speaking Truth...|access-date=2017-12-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; to another part of Decatur.

==Controversies==
Paulk was involved with many [[sex scandal]]s spanning several decades.&lt;ref name="one"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.religionnewsblog.com/13430/sex-charges-cast-pall-on-bishop-paulk|title=Sex charges cast pall on Bishop Paulk|accessdate=August 31, 2007|publisher=[[Atlanta Journal-Constitution]]|year=2006|author=Gayle White}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tricia Weeks and others===
In 1992, six women accused Earl Paulk, Don Paulk and two other nephews who were ministers at the church, of sexual manipulation.  One of them was Tricia Weeks, who had [[ghostwriter|ghostwritten]] Paulk's autobiography.  The story received considerable national coverage.  Earl Paulk denied the allegations, claiming Weeks was either mentally unstable or under evil influences.  However, he admitted the adulterous affair which forced him out of Hemphill Church of God 32 years earlier.&lt;ref name="one"/&gt;

=== Jessica Battle ===
In 2001, Jessica Battle, a college student who had been part of the church’s arts ministry dance group, sued Paulk, accusing him of molesting her between the ages of 7 and 11, and later of forcing himself on her when she was 17.&lt;ref name="one"/&gt;  The suit was settled out of court in 2003 for $400,000, allegedly using money from [[#Mona Brewer|Mona]] and Bobby Brewer.&lt;ref name="one"/&gt;

=== Cindy Hall ===
Cindy Hall was born in 1960 and was one of the first children born into Chapel Hill Harvester.&lt;ref name="one"/&gt; In 2003, she claimed that Paulk had convinced her into a lengthy affair that also included her having sex with Paulk's brother, Don.&lt;ref name="one"/&gt;  Hall alleges that the affair began in 1983&lt;ref name="one"/&gt; (in a manner very similar to [[#Mona Brewer|Mona Brewer]]'s a few years later) when Paulk prayed for her, then kissed her. He then would say he intended to "make love" to her.&lt;ref name="one"/&gt; At one point, Paulk supposedly would tell her that they had a "special gift of love outside holy matrimony".&lt;ref name="one"/&gt;  The relationship became a weekly occurrence.&lt;ref name="one"/&gt;  She left the church in 2003 after being convinced that Jessica Battle was telling the truth about being molested by Paulk.&lt;ref name="one"/&gt;

Hall chose not to become involved in the [[#Mona Brewer|Brewer]]s' lawsuit in part because of the length of time since her relationship with Paulk.  Hall also claims that at Paulk’s request, she denied having sex with him, lying under oath at her deposition for the Battle case.&lt;ref name="one"/&gt;

===Mona Brewer===
Mona Manning Brewer came to the church at the age of 19, four years after her conversion to [[Christianity]]. She was a Sunday School teacher who married Bobby Brewer, a minister at the church, in 1987. She was also featured regularly as a soloist on Paulk's television program.  Brewer claimed that on September 11, 1989; Paulk felt "'impressed of the Lord' to get to know her better".&lt;ref name="one"/&gt;  She stopped by his office the next day, becoming a regular visitor. She alleged that a church official stated that there had been a "[[word of knowledge]]" claiming that she was about to enter a new relationship that would benefit her.  That relationship became an extramarital affair that lasted 14 years.&lt;ref name="one"/&gt;

She didn't break the relationship off until September 2003, years later, and didn't tell anyone until hearing about Cindy Hall.&lt;ref name="one"/&gt;  She then told her husband, who bided his time until the refinancing of the church was finished.  In March 2004, Bobby Brewer angrily confronted Earl and Don Paulk at the Brewers' house, at one point hitting them both.&lt;ref name="one"/&gt;

The Brewers eventually sued Paulk and his church on August 31, 2005, claiming Paulk misused his position to manipulate her into a sexual relationship for fourteen years and claiming Paulk owed US$400,000 for a loan Brewer issued to settle the Jessica Battle suit.&lt;ref name="one"/&gt;

Paulk denied the allegations from Brewers but his attorney acknowledged a sexual relationship between the bishop and Mona Brewer.&lt;ref name="one"/&gt;  Paulk claimed that the relationship was brief and that she was the initiator.&lt;ref name="DropsSuit"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Couple Drops Suit against Paulk|year=2007|author=Gayle White | work = Atlanta Journal Constitution}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Monday, March 5, 2007, at a pretrial hearing, the Brewers' lawyer wrote out a request for dismissal of the case by hand and handed it to lawyers for Paulk and the church.  This was just as a ruling was about to come on a motion by Paulk's lawyers to dismiss the allegations. By dropping the case before the ruling, the Brewers left open the possibility of filing another suit with the same allegations.   "We were having difficulty even at this point getting witnesses to speak out against the acts of Bishop Paulk and the church," Levenson said. "Sometimes you just have to do this."&lt;ref name="DropsSuit"/&gt;&lt;ref name="three"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.charismamag.com/display.php?id=15629|title=Sex-Assault Lawsuit Against Earl Paulk Refiled|accessdate=August 31, 2007|publisher=charismamag.com|year=2007|author=charismamag.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Brewers did, in fact, refile the suit with another judge.  However, in February 2008, DeKalb County Judge Mark Anthony Scott threw the case into limbo when he ruled that she was "of sound mind" when she and Paulk began their relationship.  Scott ordered the Brewers to reimburse Paulk for $1 million in legal expenses for filing a frivolous suit.  Under Georgia law, the second suit they filed couldn't continue until the attorneys' fees were paid.  However, in February 2009, the [[Georgia Court of Appeals]] reversed Scott's decision, citing numerous instances where Paulk himself stated under oath that he was Mona Brewer's "spiritual adviser, minister, pastor and reverend."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.myfoxatlanta.com/dpp/news/iteam_paulk_lawsuit_appeal_021609|title=FOX 5 Atlanta - Breaking Atlanta News, Weather, SKYFOX Traffic - WAGA|first=|last=FOX|publisher=|accessdate=15 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Paulk's death removed him from the suit, Mona Brewer said she fully intended to continue her suit against the church.

=== Donnie Earl Paulk ===
On October 14, 2007, Donnie Earl (D.E.) Paulk, who had become senior pastor of the church a few months earlier, informed a shocked congregation that a DNA test had revealed he was Earl Paulk's son, and not his nephew as he had believed for all his life.&lt;ref name="five"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20071119/ap_on_re_us/preacher_paternity_1|title=The Sex scandal hits Atlanta-area megachurch|accessdate=November 19, 2007|publisher=Associated Press|year=2007|author=Dorie Turner}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

D.E. Paulk had been raised as the son of Don Paulk, Earl Paulk's brother.  However, the test confirmed that he was the product of an illicit relationship between Earl Paulk and his sister-in-law, Clariece Paulk, who was married to Don. During the Brewer case, Earl Paulk had denied sleeping with anyone other than Mona Brewer.  However, prosecutors and the [[Georgia Bureau of Investigation]] suspected he was lying, and triggered an investigation that led to a court-ordered paternity test on Donnie Earl Paulk.  As a result, Paulk was charged with [[perjury]] on January 14, 2008.&lt;ref name="highbeam.com"/&gt;  Two days later, Paulk pleaded guilty to the charges, for which he was sentenced to ten years probation and a thousand-dollar fine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-15121319.html|title=Archbishop sentenced to 10 years probation|date=17 January 2008|publisher=|accessdate=15 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Don Paulk later said that he has forgiven his brother, and said D.E.'s paternity "made no difference in my love for my brother or my son."&lt;ref name="NYTObituary"/&gt;

=== Allegations by daughter and granddaughter ===
Paulk's daughter, Beth Bonner, appeared on [[WAGA (TV)|WAGA]] in Atlanta on December 11, 2007 and apologized on behalf of her family for her father's misdeeds.  She claimed to have confronted him as far back as the 1980s about his immorality.  According to her, he had confessed and promised to reform, but reneged on his promise. Revelations that D.E. Paulk was her half-brother rather than her cousin had come as no surprise to her, she said.[http://www.myfoxatlanta.com/myfox/pages/Home/Detail;jsessionid=E1B2CBD42EC4E8FB89D94E6F21D1CA9A?contentId=5187652&amp;version=1&amp;locale=EN-US&amp;layoutCode=VSTY&amp;pageId=1.1.1&amp;sflg=1]

Interviewed on the same station the next day, Bonner's daughter, Penny White (née Penielle Brooke Bonner) went public with allegations, previously made only in court papers, that her grandfather Earl Paulk had sexually abused her as a child.  Earl Paulk issued a statement through his lawyer denying the charge. [http://www.myfoxatlanta.com/myfox/pages/Home/Detail;jsessionid=7502AEC046B019719695F7D03814B719?contentId=5198774&amp;version=1&amp;locale=EN-US&amp;layoutCode=VSTY&amp;pageId=1.1.1&amp;sflg=1]

==Theological concerns==
Paulk found his theology criticized concerning accusations of promoting [[Dominionism]] and [[Word of Faith]] teaching.&lt;ref name="four"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iclnet.org/pub/resources/text/cri/cri-jrnl/web/crj0022a.html|title=The Gospel According to Paulk: A Critique of "Kingdom Theology"|accessdate=August 31, 2007|publisher=Christian Research Institute Journal|year=1994|author=Robert M. Bowman, Jr.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Before opening his doors to the gay and lesbian community, he had close ties to the [[Christian Reconstructionism|Reconstructionist]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-174749565.html|title=Ga.

==Death==
Paulk died early on the morning of March 29, 2009, at [[Atlanta Medical Center]] after a long battle with cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ajc.com/404/XQ0r5JpZQy8oY6ivdh3R8L/|title=AJC Homepage|publisher=|accessdate=15 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Emily Harris''' (born February 11, 1947 as '''Emily Montague Schwartz''') was, along with her husband [[William Harris (Symbionese Liberation Army)|William Harris]] (1945-), a member of the [[Symbionese Liberation Army]] (SLA), an [[United States|American]] left-wing terrorist group involved in bank robberies, kidnapping and murder. In the 1970s, she was convicted of kidnapping [[Patty Hearst]]. In 2003, she was convicted of murder in the second degree for being the shooter in a 1975 slaying that occurred while she and other SLA members were robbing a bank in California. She was sentenced to eight years in prison for the murder.

==Early life==
Born in [[Baltimore, Maryland]],&lt;ref name="fbi wanted poster"&gt;The [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Patti_Hearst_et._al._wanted_poster_01.jpg FBI poster] gives some biographical details. Place of birth is given as Baltimore, Maryland, although with the note "not supported by birth records"&lt;/ref&gt; and raised in [[Clarendon Hills, Illinois]],&lt;ref name="usatoday"&gt;{{cite web |date=1975-10-06|url = http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20065714,00.html|title = Sara, Patty, Emily, Squeaky: Four Women in California Who Took Trips into Terror|publisher = [[USA Today]]| accessdate = 2012-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harris was the daughter of Frederick Schwartz, an engineer, and had a middle-class upbringing. She graduated from [[Indiana University]] with a bachelor's degree in language arts.

==Founding the Symbionese Liberation Army==
Emily and Bill Harris arrived in [[Berkeley, California]] in 1973 from [[Bloomington, Indiana]]. They came with their friends [[Gary Atwood]] and [[Angela Atwood]]. They soon joined a left-wing group that, among other things, visited prisoners in northern California. The Harrises met an escaped prisoner, [[Donald DeFreeze]]. They joined the SLA, created by [[Patricia Soltysik|Mizmoon Soltysik]], [[Nancy Ling Perry]], [[Joe Remiro]], [[Russ Little (SLA)|Russ Little]], [[Willie Wolfe]], Angela Atwood, [[Thero Wheeler]] and Camilla Hall. Emily Harris's ''[[nom de guerre]]'' was Yolanda.&lt;ref name="maebrussell"&gt;{{cite web |date=February 1974|url = http://www.maebrussell.com/Mae%20Brussell%20Articles/Why%20Was%20Hearst%20Kidnapped%201.html|title = Why Was Patricia Hearst Kidnapped?|publisher = ''The Realist''| accessdate = 2007-08-18 | last=Mae Brussell}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 6, the SLA committed its first public act, the assassination of popular [[Oakland, California]] school superintendent [[Marcus Foster]]. The SLA mistakenly thought Foster was behind a plan to create student identification cards for Oakland high schools. Subsequently, they kidnapped [[Patricia Hearst]], the college student heir to the Hearst newspaper chain. &lt;ref name="Toobin"&gt;{{cite book| last = Toobin | first =Jeffrey | authorlink = | title =American Heiress: The Wild Saga of the Kidnapping, Crimes and Trial of Patty Hearst | publisher = Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group | year = 2016| page = | isbn = 978-0385536714}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later SLA and Opsahl murder==
Emily and Bill Harris took over the leadership of the SLA after six other SLA members died in a [[Los Angeles]] shootout with police and the house fire it triggered. After the fire, the Harrises spent over a year eluding the authorities with Hearst, and new members [[Kathleen Soliah]], Josephine Soliah, Steven Soliah, Mike Bortin, Jim Kilgore, and [[Wendy Yoshimura]]. Hearst herself had since become a participant in SLA crimes.  Yoshimura, Patty's closest friend while underground, was a fugitive for her involvement with explosives that were stored in a garage she rented.  During that year the SLA committed a string of crimes, including an April 21, 1975, robbery of [[Crocker National Bank]] in [[Carmichael, California]].  During the robbery, 42-year-old Myrna Opsahl was shotgunned to death. Opsahl was depositing a church collection at the time.  Patty Hearst stated in her 1982 autobiography ''[[Every Secret Thing (Hearst book)|Every Secret Thing]]'' that Emily was the shooter. Hearst also stated that Harris said, "Oh, she's dead, but it doesn't really matter. She was a bourgeois pig anyway.  Her husband is a doctor."  Other SLA members had urged Harris not to bring the shotgun to the robbery, as it had accidentally discharged twice during preparations. 

The Harrises were eventually arrested and served eight years in prison for the Hearst kidnapping. 
Imprisoned at the [[California Institution for Women]] at [[Frontera, California]], Emily Harris spent the first half of her term in solitary confinement. Emily learned computer programming in prison.

==Life after first prison term==
After her release from prison in 1983, Harris became a computer programmer and began a successful computer consulting company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=20020615&amp;slug=sla15 | work=The Seattle Times | first=Mitchell | last=Landsberg | title=New life, old murder: Ex-radical Emily Harris faces charges 19 years after release from prison | date=June 15, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She worked  at MGM Studios until her second conviction. She divorced her husband.

==Opsahl murder charges==
For over 25 years no one was charged in the Opsahl murder.  The SLA wore wigs and masks during the Crocker Bank robbery, and left little evidence behind.&lt;ref name="metroactive"&gt;{{cite web |year=2007 |url = http://www.metroactive.com/papers/metro/04.11.02/cover/sla1-0215.html|title = Patty Cakes - Terror, nostalgia and the SLA  Gordon Young|publisher = metroactive| accessdate = 2007-08-18 | last=Gordon Young |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, with new forensics techniques, the FBI was eventually able to link shotgun pellets removed from Opsahl's body to shotgun shells found in an SLA hideout.&lt;ref name="rickross"&gt;{{cite web |date=2002-01-18|url = http://www.culteducation.com/reference/symbionese/symbionese16.html|title = New Evidence Paved Way for Arrests in a '75 Killing|work=[[The New York Times]]| accessdate = 2007-08-18 | last=James Sterngold}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additional evidence mounted, and in January 2002 Harris and three other SLA members were charged with the Opsahl murder.  Harris's bail was set at one million US dollars, which her supporters quickly gathered.

Three former SLA members who had been granted immunity - Hearst, [[Steven Soliah]], and [[Wendy Yoshimura]] - were set to testify for the prosecution in the Opsahl case. 

Facing a possible conviction, Harris and the others pleaded guilty to second-degree murder in November 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2002-11-08/news/0211080283_1_bank-slaying-sara-jane-olson-bank-robbery|title=4 ex-SLA members plead guilty to '75 bank slaying|last=|first=|date=November 8, 2002|work=Chicago Tribune|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Harris was sentenced to eight additional years in prison; Bill Harris was sentenced to seven years and [[Kathleen Soliah]] and [[Michael Bortin]] were each sentenced to six years for their roles.

Emily Harris was paroled in February 2007 after having served four years in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/2009/03/17/convicted-domestic-terrorist-freed-from-california-prison.html|title=Convicted Domestic Terrorist Freed From California Prison|last=|first=|date=2009-03-17|work=Fox News|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''English-language radio''' refers to radio stations that broadcast primarily in the English language and are located in countries where English is not an official language or majority language. Often referred to as "English-speaking radio" or "Expat radio" the broadcasts enables expats, vacationers and travelers to listen to radio in their native language while traveling abroad. The idea is that stations broadcast in English to popular holiday destinations such as [[Pattaya]] or the [[French Riviera]] or places with high [[Expatriate|expat]] communities. English language broadcasting also takes the form of military-backed radio such as the [[American Forces Network]]. However English-language radio based in foreign countries has to now compete with the introduction of [[internet radio]] and satellite technology that has increased listener's access to English-language radio based in "home" counties.

==History==

The first English-language radio in a foreign country transmission was thought to be in 1925 when Radio Paris broadcast from the [[Eiffel Tower]], a show about fashion design, sponsored by [[Selfridges]] of London.

With end of [[World War II]] [[American military|American]] and [[British military|British]] forces began occupation of bases within regions of conquered [[Axis powers|Axis]] countries such as [[Germany]] and [[Okinawa]] for the enjoyment and informative power radio bring to both the troops and their families. Today traditions remain as the [[American Forces Network]] and the [[British Forces Broadcasting Service]] continue to provide English-language entertainment and information to troops stationed abroad in their respective countries or areas.

Non-military English broadcasting gained momentum with the increase in [[globalization]] after World War II. As English-speaking business personnel and [[Expatriate|expat]] communities grew because of international trade and investment, so did the demand for English language entertainment. As the number of global English speakers has grown, demand from the local native market has grown as well. Stations that actively reach out to the local community such as [[International Community Radio Taipei]] have been on the rise.

==Location==

The location of most English-language radio stations can be determined by their proximity to large populations of English speakers. [[Geneva, Switzerland]], for example, has many English speakers and [[expatriate]]s, also the Spanish coastal areas, and thus English radio broadcasts. Radio stations in places such as [[Baja California]] and [[Costa Rica]] also serve the increasing number of English speakers.

'''European Moroccans''' are [[Demographics of Morocco|Moroccans]] whose ancestry lies within the continent of [[Europe]], most notably [[France]] and [[Spain]]. Many European families settled in the country during [[French protectorate in Morocco|French]] and [[Spanish Morocco|Spanish]] rule, from 1912 to 1955.

Prior to independence, Morocco was home to half a million [[Europeans]],&lt;ref&gt;De Azevedo, Raimondo Cagiano (1994) ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=N8VHizsqaH0C&amp;pg=PA25 Migration and development co-operation.]''.

Harvard University Press. p.323. {{ISBN|0-674-01017-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the kingdom's independence in 1955, the European population has decreased substantially.

At the beginning of the 20th century, 250,000 [[Spaniards]] lived in Morocco. Most left Morocco after its independence and their numbers were reduced to 13,000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.migrationinformation.org/Profiles/display.cfm?id=97 Spain: Forging an Immigration Policy], Migration Information Source&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.joshuaproject.net/countries.php?rog3=MO Joshua Project - Ethnic People Groups of Morocco&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Freechild Institute for Youth Engagement''' is a nonprofit organization focused on creating connections between adults and young people through programs, technical assistance, publications, training, and curriculum. [[Adam Fletcher (activist)|Adam Fletcher]] is the executive director, and the institute is located in [[Olympia, Washington]].&lt;ref name="planning.org"&gt;Mullahey, R. (2007) [http://www.planning.org/resourceszine/articleview.htm?ArticleID=8925 "The FreeChild Project: Youth-led Social Change"], [[American Planning Association]].

== History ==
Fletcher started the organization as "The Freechild Project" in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nylc.org/rc_downloaddetail.cfm?emoid=14:176 "The Youth Voice Movement: A New Vision for the Future, or a Lost Dream of the Past?"] [[National Youth Leadership Council]].

Retrieved 15 August 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Activities ==
The mission of Freechild is "to advocate, inform, and celebrate social change led by and with young people around the world, particularly those who have been historically denied the right to participate. They provide examples and resources to youth and their adult allies."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freechild.org/aboutus.htm "About Us"], The Freechild Project website. Retrieved 17 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The group advocates "radical democracy."&lt;ref&gt;David E. Lowes.

Freechild believes it is completely unethical to exclude young people from [[Youth participation|participating]] in the actions that affect them most. Their programs include [[service-learning]], topic-specific workshops and [[Youth activism|activist group]] incubation.  The group consults with local and national nonprofit groups in strategic planning, capacity building and product development with [[youth empowerment]] at the center of their priorities. They also perform networking services through conferences and online communications.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.netsquared.org/freechild "Youth and the Web: Adam Fletcher from the Free Child Project".] Netsquared, a project of [[TechSoup.org]].

The organization is coordinated by one full-time staff member, offers activities through a network of trainers, and is advised by youth and adult experts from across the US.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mediarights.org/organization/freechild_project "Freechild Project."] MediaRights.org.

'''Gas depletion''' is the decline in [[natural gas]] production of a well, gas field, or geographic area.&lt;ref&gt;US Energy Information Administration, [http://www.eia.gov/oiaf/servicerpt/depletion/ Accelerated depletion]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Depletion "date"==
According to the US [[Energy Information Administration]], in 1980 the world had enough proved gas reserves to last 48 years at the 1980 rate of production. Cumulative world gas production from 1980 through 2011 was greater than the proved gas reserves in 1980. In 2011, world proved gas reserves were enough to last 58 years at 2011 production levels, even though the 2011 production rate was more than double the 1980 rate.&lt;ref&gt;US Energy Information Administration, [http://www.eia.gov/cfapps/ipdbproject/IEDIndex3.cfm?tid=3&amp;pid=26&amp;aid=1 International energy statistics], accessed 16 Sept. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role of new technology==
As new technologies for natural gas production are discovered, the world's ultimate reserves can grow.  Although some predictions of ultimate reserve recovery include provisions for new technology, not every magnitude of breakthrough can be accurately accounted for.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}

More than half the increase in US natural gas production from 2006 to 2008 came from Texas, where production rose 15% between the first quarter of 2007 and the first quarter of 2008. This was mostly due to improved technology, which allowed the production of deepwater offshore and "unconventional" resources. Important new developments were [[horizontal drilling]] and [[fracking]] in a geologic formation known as the [[Barnett Shale]], underlying the city of [[Fort Worth]], which is a highly [[permeability (earth sciences)|impermeable]] formation and difficult to produce by conventional means. The Barnett Shale now produces 6% of US natural gas. Other [[shale gas]] formations in the lower 48 states are widely distributed, and are known to contain large resources of natural gas.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;!-- EDIT BELOW THIS LINE --&gt;

'''The Gender and Sexuality in Information Studies Colloquium''' took place at [[University of Toronto Faculty of Information]] on October 18, 2014. The conference was the result of book four, '''[http://litwinbooks.com/fqis-reader.php ''Feminist and Queer Information Studies Reader'']''' of the [[Litwin Books, LLC|Litwin Books]] series Gender and Sexuality in Information Studies. The book was published in October 2013.  The event was hosted by one of the book editors,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Keilty|first1=Patrick|website=patrickkeilty.com |url=http://www.patrickkeilty.com|accessdate=22 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Patrick Keilty, and the editor of the book series, [[Emily Drabinski]].

[[File:Gender and Sexuality in Information Studies, University of Toronto Faculty of Information.jpg|thumb|Poster for Gender and Sexuality in Information Studies Colloquium, University of Toronto Faculty of Information]]

The conference emphasized topics in gender, sexuality, LGBTQ, race, and legal studies in the library and information science and archival science professions. The presenters analyzed prevailing practices in library and archival cataloging, classification, organization, and appraisal. Library and archive collections of difference using [[queer theory]], [[critical race theory]] ([[intersectionality]]), [[standpoint theory]], and [[appraisal theory]], to name a few, were used to develop arguments. Presenters also discussed the right to disappear online, print and digital resources, and institutional and community archives.

There were approximately 100 attendees.

== Format ==

The day began with the opening session, "Queering Order." All conference participants attended the opening panel. The day was then organized into nine breakout sessions that took place in assigned rooms.

The breakout sessions were organized as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Collquium Agenda|website=http://litwinbooks.com/2014agenda.php|accessdate=22 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Porn in the Library
* Gendering Information Technology
* Technology and the Body
* Affect and Information
* Gender, Sexuality, and Collections
* Gender and Sexuality in Library Praxis
* Gender and the Profession
* Archives of Difference
* Description and its Discontents

All paper titles, abstracts, and some presentations can be found on the colloquium agenda page, which will serve as an open access repository.
Some papers will be selected for publishing in a special issue of the peer-reviewed academic journal, [[Library Trends]].

The organizers were not certain if the conference was a one-time event, or if it would be the first of many.

== Controversy ==
Many attendees noted a lack of diversity in language and attendance. Attendance and participation was particularly low among [[transgender]] black people, transgender people of color, [[cisgender]] black people, and cisgender people of color. Further, there was a critique of the emphasis on [[normative]] perspective, i.e. the white female librarian, or archivist perspective was emphasized in most presentations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Robertson|first1=Tara|title=Digesting the Gender and Sexuality in Information Studies Colloquium|website=http://tararobertson.ca/2014/digesting-the-gender-and-sexuality-in-information-studies-colloquium/|accessdate=22 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:US gender pay gap, by sex, race-ethnicity-2009.png|thumb|Median weekly earnings of full-time wage and salary workers, by sex, race, and ethnicity, 2009.&lt;ref name="bls 2009"&gt;U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.

The '''gender pay gap in the United States''' is the ratio of female-to-male median or average (depending on the source) yearly earnings among full-time, year-round workers.

The average woman's unadjusted annual salary has been cited as 78%&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://money.cnn.com/2015/04/13/news/economy/equal-pay-day-2015/ | title=78 cents on the dollar: The facts about the gender wage gap | work=CNN Money | date=April 14, 2015 | accessdate=May 28, 2015 | author=O'Brien, Sara Ashley | location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; to 82%&lt;ref name="BLS2014"&gt;U.S. Department of Labor, U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, [http://www.bls.gov/opub/reports/cps/women-in-the-labor-force-a-databook-2014.pdf Women in the Labor Force: A Databook], December 2014 Report 1052 (accessed June 4, 2015)&lt;/ref&gt; of that of the average man's. However, after adjusting for choices made by male and female workers in college major, occupation, working hours, and parental leave, multiple studies find that pay rates between males and females varied by 5–6.6% or, females earning 94 cents to every dollar earned by their male counterparts. The remaining 6% of the gap has been speculated to originate from gender discrimination and a difference in ability and/or willingness to negotiate salaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=An Analysis of Reasons for the Disparity in Wages Between Men and Women|url=http://www.hawaii.edu/religion/courses/Gender_Wage_Gap_Report.pdf|publisher=US Department of Labor; CONSAD Research Corp|accessdate=February 16, 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160327195224/http://www.hawaii.edu/religion/courses/Gender_Wage_Gap_Report.pdf|archivedate=March 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.factcheck.org/2012/06/obamas-77-cent-exaggeration/|website=FactCheck.org|title=Obama's 77-Cent Exaggeration|author=Jackson, Brooks|date=June 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.aauw.org/files/2013/02/graduating-to-a-pay-gap-the-earnings-of-women-and-men-one-year-after-college-graduation.pdf|format=PDF|title=Graduating to a Pay Gap – The Earnings of Women and Men One Year after College Graduation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The extent to which discrimination plays a role in explaining gender wage disparities is somewhat difficult to quantify, due to a number of potentially confounding variables. A 2010 research review by the majority staff of the [[United States Congress Joint Economic Committee]] reported that studies have consistently found unexplained pay differences even after controlling for measurable factors that are assumed to influence earnings – suggestive of unknown/unmeasurable contributing factors of which gender discrimination may be one.&lt;ref name="jec p80"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[United States Congress Joint Economic Committee]] |url=http://jec.senate.gov/public/?a=Files.Serve&amp;File_id=9118a9ef-0771-4777-9c1f-8232fe70a45c |title=Invest in Women, Invest in America: A Comprehensive Review of Women in the U.S. Economy |location=Washington, DC |date=December 2010 |page=80}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other studies have found direct evidence of discrimination – for example, more jobs went to women when the applicant's sex was unknown during the hiring process.&lt;ref name="jec p80" /&gt;

==Statistics==
Women's median yearly earnings (which is used by the Census Bureau to calculate its gap includes bonuses, while the Bureau of Labor Statistics uses weekly earnings which does not&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Women in the Labor Force, A Databook|url=http://www.bls.gov/opub/reports/cps/women-in-the-labor-force-a-databook-2014.pdf|website=Bureau of Labor Statistics|publisher=US Dept of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics|accessdate=17 November 2016|ref=Report 1052}}&lt;/ref&gt;) relative to men's rose rapidly from 1980 to 1990 (from 60.2% to 71.6%), and less rapidly from 1990 to 2000 (from 71.6% to 73.7%) and from 2000 to 2009 (from 73.7% to 77.0%).&lt;ref name="census 2009"&gt;{{cite web|author-last1=DeNavas-Walt |author-first1=Carmen |author-first2=Bernadette D. |author-last2=Proctor |author-first3=Jessica C. |author-last3=Smith |url= https://www.census.gov/prod/2010pubs/p60-238.pdf |title= Income, Poverty, and Health Insurance Coverage in the United States: 2009. |publisher= U.S. Census Bureau, Current Population Reports, P60-238, U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, DC |date= 2010 |pages= 7, 50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===By state===

In 2016, women's earnings were lower than men's earnings in all states and the [[District of Columbia]] according to a survey conducted by the [[United States Census Bureau|U.S. Census Bureau]].&lt;ref name="survey2016"&gt;{{cite web|title= Highlights of women's earnings in 2016 |date= August 2017 |publisher= U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics |url= https://www.bls.gov/opub/reports/womens-earnings/2016/pdf/home.pdf |pages= 53–55 |format= PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; The national female-to-male earnings ratio was 81.9%. Utah ranked lowest at 69.9% and Vermont ranked highest at 90.2%.&lt;ref name="survey2016"/&gt; 

===By industry and occupation===

[[File:US Gender Pay Gap by industry .001.png|thumb|350px|left|Women's median usual weekly earnings as percentage of men's, for full-time workers, by industry, 2009.&lt;ref name="by industry"&gt;Bureau of Labor Statistics.

Women's median weekly earnings were lower than men's median weekly earnings in all industries in 2009. The industry with the largest gender pay gap was financial activities. Median weekly earnings of women employed in financial activities were 70.5% of men's median weekly earnings in that industry. Construction was the industry with the smallest gender pay gap, with women earning 92.2% of what men earned.&lt;ref name="by industry"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bureau of Labor Statistics. [http://www.bls.gov/opub/ted/2011/ted_20110216.htm ''Women's earnings and employment by industry, 2009.''] TED article, February 16, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, women's weekly median earnings were higher than men's in only four of the 108 occupations for which sufficient data were available to the [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]]. The four occupations with higher weekly median earnings for women than men were "Other life, physical, and social science technicians" (102.4%), "bakers" (104.0%), "teacher assistants" (104.6%), and "dining room and cafeteria attendants and bartender helpers" (111.1%). The four largest gender wage gaps were found in well-paying occupations such as "Physicians and surgeons" (64.2%), "securities, commodities and financial services sales agents" (64.5%), "financial managers" (66.6%), and "other business operations specialists" (66.9%).&lt;ref name="bls 2009"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ariane Hegewisch, Claudia Williams, and Amber Henderson.

The [[Bureau of Labor Statistics|BLS]] report ''Highlights in Women's Earnings in 2003'' showed that there were only two occupations in 2003 where women's median weekly earnings exceeded men's. The two occupations were "Packers and packagers, hand" (101.4%) and "Health diagnosing and treating
practitioner support technicians" (100.5%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| publisher= Bureau of Labor Statistics, Report 978|url= http://www.bls.gov/cps/cpswom2003.pdf |title= Highlights in Women's Earnings in 2003 |date= September 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009 [[Bloomberg News]] reported that the sixteen women heading companies in the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 Index averaged earnings of $14.2&amp;nbsp;million in their latest fiscal years, 43 percent more than the male average. Bloomberg News also found that of the people who were S&amp;P 500 CEOs in 2008, women got a 19 percent raise in 2009 while men took a 5 percent cut.&lt;ref&gt;Bloomberg.

Several studies of women in the legal profession reveal persistent gaps in partnership numbers at major American Law Firms.  Despite the fact that women have graduated from law schools in equal numbers for over twenty years, only 16–19% of law firm partners are women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Joan C. |last1=Williams |first2=Veta |last2=Richardson |title=New Millennium, Same Glass Ceiling?

On August 26, 2016 [[USAtoday]] reported that the [[Hollywood]] gender pay gap is wider than that for average working women and that it is worse for older women stars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2016/08/25/why-men-make-more-than-women-hollywood/89340644/|title=Why men make more than women in Hollywood|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that, in 2013, female full-time workers had median weekly earnings of $706, compared to men's median weekly earnings of $860. Women aged 35 years and older earned 74% to 80% of the earnings of their male counterparts. Among younger workers, the earning differences between women and men were smaller, with women aged 16 to 24 earning 88.3% of men's earnings in the same age group ($423 and $479, respectively).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.bls.gov/opub/reports/cps/highlights-of-womens-earnings-in-2013.pdf |title= Highlights of women's earnings in 2013|publisher= U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, Report 1051|date= December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Andrew Beveridge, a Professor of Sociology at [[Queens College]], between 2000 and 2005, young women in their twenties earned more than their male counterparts in some large urban centers, including Dallas (120%), New York (117%), Chicago, Boston, and Minneapolis. A major reason for this is that women have been graduating from college in larger numbers than men, and that many of those women seem to be gravitating toward major urban areas. In 2005, 53% of women in their 20s working in New York were college graduates, compared with only 38% of men of that age. Nationwide, the wages of that group of women averaged 89% of the average full-time pay for men between 2000 and 2005.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, Sam.

According to an analysis of Census Bureau data released by Reach Advisors in 2008, single childless women between ages 22 and 30 were earning more than their male counterparts in most United States cities, with incomes that were 8% greater than males on average. This shift is driven by the growing ranks of women who attend colleges and move on to high-earning jobs.&lt;ref&gt;Dougherty, Conor.

=== By race ===
In the U.S., using median hourly earnings statistics (not controlling for job type differences), disparities in pay relative to white men are largest for [[Latino (demonym)|Latina]] women (58% of white men's hourly earnings) and second-largest for [[Black people|Black]] women (65%), while white women have a pay gap of 82%. However, Asian women earn 87% as much as white men, making them the group of women with the smallest pay gap relative to white men.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/07/01/racial-gender-wage-gaps-persist-in-u-s-despite-some-progress/|title=Racial, gender wage gaps persist in U.S. despite some progress|date=2016-07-01|newspaper=Pew Research Center|access-date=2016-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The average woman is expected to earn $430,480 less than the average white man over a lifetime. Native American women can expect to earn $883,040 less, Black women earn $877,480 less, and Latina women earn $1,007,080 less over a lifetime.

==Explaining the gender pay gap==
{{tone||date=January 2016}}
Any given raw wage gap can be dissected into an ''explained'' part, due to differences in characteristics such as education, hours worked, work experience, and occupation, and/or an ''unexplained'' part, which is typically attributed to discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;Eagly, A.H., &amp; Carli, L. L. ''Through the labyrinth: The truth about how women become leaders.'' Boston, Mass.: Harvard Business School Press, 2007, {{ISBN|978-1-4221-1691-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This may be further explained when America takes into account that men are more likely to negotiate for higher pay.  According to a study by Carnegie Mellon, when negotiating pay, 83% of men negotiated for a higher wage compared to the 58% of women who asked for more.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Salary, Gender and the Social Cost of Haggling|url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/07/29/AR2007072900827.html|newspaper = The Washington Post|date = 2007-07-30|access-date = 2015-08-30|issn = 0190-8286|language = en|first = Shankar|last = Vedantam}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers say that women who do request either a raise or a higher starting salary are more likely than men to be penalized for those actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://hbr.org/2015/02/why-network-more-is-bad-advice-for-women&amp;cm_sp=Article-_-Links-_-Top+of+Page+Recirculation|title=Why "Network More" Is Bad Advice for Women|publisher=|date=2015-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cornell University economists [[Francine Blau]] and [[Lawrence Kahn]] stated that while the overall size of the wage gap has decreased somewhat over time, the proportion of the gap that is unexplained by human capital variables is increasing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Blau |first1=Francine D |last2=Kahn |first2=Lawrence M |year=2007 |title=The Gender Pay Gap|journal=The Economists' Voice |volume=4 |issue=4 |pages= |doi=10.2202/1553-3832.1190}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Using [[Current Population Survey]] (CPS) data for 1979 and 1995 and controlling for education, experience, personal characteristics, parental status, city and region, occupation, industry, government employment, and part-time status, Yale University economics professor Joseph G. Altonji and the United States Secretary of Commerce [[Rebecca M. Blank]] found that only about 27% of the gender wage gap in each year is explained by differences in such characteristics.&lt;ref name="Altonji, Joseph G 1999"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Altonji |first1=Joseph G. |last2=Blank |first2=Rebecca M. |year=1999 |chapter=Race and gender in the labor market |pages=3143–259 |editor1-first=Orley C. |editor1-last=Ashenfelter |editor2-first=David |editor2-last=Card |title=Handbook of Labor Economics |volume=3 |issue=C |doi=10.1016/S1573-4463(99)30039-0 |isbn=978-0-444-50189-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1993 study of graduates of the [[University of Michigan Law School]] between 1972 and 1975 examined the gender wage gap while matching men and women for possible explanatory factors such as occupation, age, experience, education, time in the workforce, childcare, average hours worked, grades while in college, and other factors. After accounting for all that, women were paid 81.5% of what men "with similar demographic characteristics, family situations, work hours, and work experience" were paid.&lt;ref name="Wood, Robert G. 1993. pp. 417–41"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wood |first1=Robert G.|last2= Corcoran |first2= Mary E. |last3= Courant|first3= Paul| year= 1993 |title= Pay Differences Among the Highly Paid: the Male-Female Earnings Gap in Lawyers' Salaries |journal= Journal of Labor Economics |volume= 11 |issue= 3 |pages= 417–41 |doi= 10.1086/298302|url= http://davideharrington.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/R22-Earnings-Gap-in-Lawyers-Salaries.pdf|accessdate=March 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, a comprehensive study by the staff of the [[U.S. Government Accountability Office]] found that the gender wage gap can only be partially explained by human capital factors and "work patterns." The GAO study, released in 2003, was based on data from 1983 through 2000 from a representative sample of Americans between the ages of 25 and 65. The researchers controlled for "work patterns," including years of work experience, education, and hours of work per year, as well as differences in industry, occupation, race, marital status, and job tenure. With controls for these variables in place, the data showed that women earned, on average, 20% less than men during the entire period 1983 to 2000. In a subsequent study, GAO found that the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and the Department of Labor "should better monitor their performance in enforcing anti-discrimination laws."&lt;ref&gt;GAO.

Using CPS data, U.S. Bureau of Labor economist Stephanie Boraas and [[College of William &amp; Mary]] economics professor William R. Rodgers III report that only 39% of the gender pay gap is explained in 1999, controlling for percent female, schooling, experience, region, [[Metropolitan Statistical Area]] size, minority status, part-time employment, marital status, union, government employment, and industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Stephanie |last1=Boraas |first2=William M. |last2=Rodgers |year=2003 |title=How does gender play a role in the earnings gap?

Using data from longitudinal studies conducted by the U.S. Department of Education, researchers Judy Goldberg Dey and Catherine Hill analyzed some 9,000 college graduates from 1992–93 and more than 10,000 from 1999–2000. The researchers controlled for a multitude of variables, including: occupation, industry, hours worked per week, workplace flexibility, ability to telecommute, whether employee worked multiple jobs, months at employer, marital status,  whether employee had children, and whether employee volunteered in the past year. The study found that wage inequities start early and worsen over time. "The portion of the pay gap that remains unexplained after all other factors are taken into account is 5 percent one year after graduation and 12 percent 10 years after graduation. These unexplained gaps are evidence of discrimination, which remains a serious problem for women in the work force."&lt;ref name="denverpost.com"&gt;Carman, Diane.

In a 1997 study, economists Francine Blau and Lawrence Kahn took a set of human capital variables such as education, labor market experience, and race into account and additionally controlled for occupation, industry, and unionism. While the gender wage gap was considerably smaller when all variables were taken into account, a substantial portion of the pay gap (12%) remained unexplained.&lt;ref name="aysps.gsu.edu"&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Francine D. |last1=Blau |first2=Lawrence M. |last2=Kahn |date=January 1997 |title=Swimming Upstream: Trends in the Gender Wage Differential in the 1980s |journal=Journal of Labor Economics |volume=15 |issue=1 |pages=1–42 |jstor=2535313 |ssrn=10786 |doi=10.1086/209845}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study by John McDowell, Larry Singell and James Ziliak investigated faculty promotion on the economics profession and found that, controlling for quality of PhD training, publishing productivity, major field of specialization, current placement in a distinguished department, age and post-PhD experience, female economists were still significantly less likely to be promoted from assistant to associate and from associate to full professor—although there was also some evidence that women's promotion opportunities from associate to full professor improved in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=McDowell |first1=John M |last2=Singell |first2=Larry D |last3=Ziliak |first3=James P |year=1999 |title=Cracks in the Glass Ceiling: Gender and Promotion in the Economics Profession |journal=American Economic Review |volume=89 |issue=2 |pages=392–96 |jstor=117142 |doi=10.1257/aer.89.2.392}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Economist June O'Neill, former director of the Congressional Budget Office, found an unexplained pay gap of 8% after controlling for experience, education, and number of years on the job. Furthermore, O'Neill found that among young people who have never had a child, women's earnings approach 98 percent of men's.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=O'Neill |first1=June |last2=O'Neill |first2=Dave |year=2005 |title=What Do Wage Differentials Tell Us about Labor Market Discrimination? |ssrn=697165 |doi=10.3386/w11240}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a stance rejecting discrimination, a 2009 study for the Department of Labour by the CONSAD Research Corporation concluded, "it is not possible now, and doubtless will never be possible, to determine reliably whether any portion of the observed gender wage gap is not attributable to factors that compensate women and men differently on socially acceptable bases, and hence can confidently be attributed to overt discrimination against women." and continued "In addition, at a practical level, the complex combination of factors that collectively determine the wages paid to different individuals makes the formulation of policy that will reliably redress any overt discrimination that does exist a task that is, at least, daunting and, more likely, unachievable. The conclusion was based largely on a study by Eric Solberg &amp; Teresa Laughlin (1995), who found that "occupational selection is the primary determinant of the gender wage gap" (as opposed to discrimination) because "any measure of earnings that excludes fringe benefits may produce misleading results as to the existence magnitude, consequence, and source of market discrimination." They found that the average wage rate of females was only 87.4% of the average wage rate of males; whereas, when earnings were measured by their index of total compensation (including fringe benefits), the average value of the index for females was 96.4% of the average value for males.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.consad.com/content/reports/Gender%20Wage%20Gap%20Final%20Report.pdf "Gender Wage Gap Final Report] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131008051216/http://www.consad.com/content/reports/Gender%20Wage%20Gap%20Final%20Report.pdf |date=October 8, 2013 }}, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2010 study by [[Catalyst (nonprofit organization)|Catalyst]], a nonprofit that works to expand opportunities for women in business, of male and female MBA graduates found that after controlling for career aspirations, parental status, years of experience, industry, and other variables, male graduates are more likely to be assigned jobs of higher rank and responsibility and earn, on average, $4,600 more than women in their first post-MBA jobs.This affects women's ability to pay off student loan debt since college isn't cheaper for a woman even though she can expect to make less after she earns a degree than her male peers. This results in women being in disproportionately more debt than men. This extra debt makes having less income even more debilitating as women have a harder time paying off student loan debt.&lt;ref&gt;Stark, Betsy.

A 2014 study found that the gender pay gap in the United States decreased in size significantly from 1970 to 2010, mainly because the unexplained portion of the gap decreased significantly during this period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mandel|first=Hadas|last2=Semyonov|first2=Moshe|date=2014-10-01|title=Gender Pay Gap and Employment Sector: Sources of Earnings Disparities in the United States, 1970–2010|journal=Demography|language=en|volume=51|issue=5|pages=1597–1618|doi=10.1007/s13524-014-0320-y|pmid=25149647|issn=0070-3370}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, economists at the [[University of Chicago]] and [[Stanford University]], working with [[Uber]] analyzing the gender pay gap of Uber drivers demonstrated an average 7% pay gap in a context where gender discrimination was not possible and pay was not negotiated, showing the difference entirely explainable as the difference in average productivity between men and women as a result of driving styles (the average man drove faster),  experience (the mean male had more experience driving with Uber than the mean female), and driver choices (men on average worked hours and locations with higher returns).&lt;ref name=uber&gt;https://web.stanford.edu/~diamondr/UberPayGap.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/6/16980072/uber-driver-gender-earnings-gap-study | title=Female Uber drivers earn $1.24 per hour less than men: Study| date=2018-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The factors above explained 50%, 30%, and 20% of the variance respectively.

==Sources of disparity==

===Hours worked===
A report in 2014 by the [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]] stated that employed men worked 52 minutes more than employed women on the days they worked, and that this difference partly reflects women's greater likelihood of working part-time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bls.gov/news.release/atus.nr0.htm|title=American Time Use Survey|date=June 24, 2015|publisher=[[Bureau of Labor Statistics]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the book ''Biology at Work: Rethinking Sexual Equality'', Browne writes: "Because of the sex differences in hours worked, the hourly earnings gap [...] is a better indicator of the sexual disparity in earnings than the annual figure. Even the hourly earnings ratio does not completely capture the effects of sex differences in hours, however, because employees who work more hours also tend to earn more per hour."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

However, numerous studies indicate that variables such as hours worked account for only part of the gender pay gap and that the pay gap shrinks but does not disappear after controlling for all human capital variables known to affect pay.&lt;ref name="Altonji, Joseph G 1999"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wood, Robert G. 1993. pp. 417–41"/&gt;&lt;ref name="usgovinfo.about.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="denverpost.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="aysps.gsu.edu"/&gt; Moreover, [[Gary Becker]] argued in a 1985 article that the traditional division of labor in the family disadvantages women in the labor market as women devote substantially more time and effort to housework and have less time and effort available for performing market work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Gary S. |last1=Becker |date=January 1985 |title=Human Capital, Effort, and the Sexual Division of Labor |journal=Journal of Labor Economics |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=S33–58 |jstor=2534997}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[OECD]] (2002) found that women work fewer hours because in the present circumstances the "responsibilities for child-rearing and other unpaid household work are still unequally shared among partners."&lt;ref name="oecd.org"&gt;{{cite book |publisher=Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development |year=2002 |chapter=Women at work: who are they and how are they faring? |pages=61–125 |chapterurl=http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/28/58/18960381.pdf |title=Employment Outlook |location=Paris |isbn=978-92-64-19778-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Occupational segregation===

{{Main|Occupational segregation}}
{{Further|Pink collar}}

Occupational segregation refers to the way that some jobs (such as truck driver) are dominated by men, and other jobs (such as child care worker) are dominated by women. Considerable research suggests that predominantly female occupations pay less, even controlling for individual and workplace characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Blau |first1=Francine D |last2=Kahn |first2=Lawrence M |year=2000 |title=Gender Differences in Pay |journal=Journal of Economic Perspectives |volume=14 |issue=4 |pages=75–99 |doi=10.1257/jep.14.4.75}}&lt;/ref&gt; Economists Blau and Kahn stated that women's pay compared to men's had improved because of a decrease in occupational segregation. They also argued that the gender wage difference will decline modestly and that the extent of discrimination against women in the labor market seems to be decreasing.&lt;ref&gt;Cicarelli, James and Julianne Cicarelli. [https://books.google.com/books?id=Liu8A8KjDR0C&amp;pg=PA38&amp;lpg=PA38 ''Distinguished women economists''.] Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 2003, pp. 36–40, {{ISBN|978-0-313-30331-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, a group of researchers examined occupational segregation and its implications for the salaries assigned to male- and female-typed jobs. They investigated whether participants would assign different pay to 3 types of jobs wherein the actual responsibilities and duties carried out by men and women were the same, but the job was situated in either a traditionally masculine or traditionally feminine domain. The researchers found statistically significant pay differentials between jobs defined as "male" and "female," which suggest that gender-based discrimination, arising from occupational stereotyping and the devaluation of the work typically done by women, influences salary allocation. The results fit with contemporary theorizing about gender-based discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Alksnis |first1=Christine |last2=Desmarais |first2=Serge |last3=Curtis |first3=James |year=2008 |title=Workforce Segregation and the Gender Wage Gap: Is 'Women's' Work Valued as Highly as 'Men's'? |journal=Journal of Applied Social Psychology |volume=38 |issue=6 |pages=1416–41 |doi=10.1111/j.1559-1816.2008.00354.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vedantam, Shankar.

A study showed that if a white woman in an all-male workplace moved to an all-female workplace, she would lose 7% of her wages. If a black woman did the same thing, she would lose 19% of her wages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=England |first1=Paula |last2=Reid |first2=Lori L. |last3=Kilbourne |first3=Barbara Stanek |year=1996 |title=The Effect of the Sex Composition of Jobs on Starting wages in an Organization: Findings from the NLSY |journal=Demography |volume=33 |issue=4 |pages=511–21 |pmid=8939422 |jstor=2061784 |doi=10.2307/2061784}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study calculated that if female-dominated jobs did not pay lower wages, women's median hourly pay nationwide would go up 13.2% (men's pay would go up 1.1%, due to raises for men working in "women's jobs").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Figart |first1=Deborah M. |last2=Lapidus |first2=June |year=1996 |title=The Impact of Comparable Worth on Earnings Inequality |journal=Work and Occupations |volume=23 |issue=3 |pages=297–318 |doi=10.1177/0730888496023003004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerous studies indicate that the pay gap shrinks but does not disappear after controlling for occupation and a host of other human capital variables.&lt;ref name="Altonji, Joseph G 1999"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wood, Robert G. 1993. pp. 417–41"/&gt;&lt;ref name="usgovinfo.about.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="denverpost.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="aysps.gsu.edu"/&gt;

====Workplace flexibility====
It has been suggested that women choose less-paying occupations because they provide flexibility to better [[Work–life balance|manage work and family]]. Harvard economist Claudia Goldin has made this case in reviews of the literature in 2014 and 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://freakonomics.com/podcast/the-true-story-of-the-gender-pay-gap-a-new-freakonomics-radio-podcast/|title=The True Story of the Gender Pay Gap - Freakonomics|work=Freakonomics|access-date=2018-06-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Goldin|first=Claudia|date=2014|title=A Grand Gender Convergence: Its Last Chapter|journal=American Economic Review|language=en|volume=104|issue=4|pages=1091–1119|doi=10.1257/aer.104.4.1091|issn=0002-8282|citeseerx=10.1.1.708.4375}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2009 study of high school [[valedictorian]]s in the U.S. found that female valedictorians were planning to have careers that had a median salary of $74,608, whereas male valedictorians were planning to have careers with a median salary of $97,734. As to why the females were less likely than the males to choose high paying careers such as surgeon and engineer, the New York Times article quoted the researcher as saying, "The typical reason is that they are worried about combining family and career one day in the future."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first1=Jacques |last1=Steinberg |url=http://thechoice.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/06/01/valedictorians/ |title=Do the Ambitions of High School Valedictorians Differ by Gender? |work=New York Times |date=June 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, studies in 1990 by [[Jerry A. Jacobs]] and Ronnie Steinberg, as well as Jennifer Glass separately, found that male-dominated jobs actually have more flexibility and autonomy than female-dominated jobs, thus allowing a person, for example, to more easily leave work to tend to a sick child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Glass |first1=Jennifer |year=1990 |title=The Impact of Occupational Segregation on Working Conditions |journal=Social Forces |volume=68 |issue=3 |pages=779–96 |jstor=2579353 |doi=10.1093/sf/68.3.779}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jacobs |first1=Jerry A. |last2=Steinberg |first2=Ronnie J. |year=1990 |title=Compensating Differentials and the Male-Female Wage Gap: Evidence from the New York State Comparable Worth Study |journal=Social Forces |volume=69 |issue=2 |pages=439–68 |jstor=2579667 |doi=10.1093/sf/69.2.439}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[Heather Boushey]] stated that men actually have more access to workplace flexibility and that it is a "[[political myth|myth]] that women choose less-paying occupations because they provide flexibility to better manage work and family."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Center for Economic and Policy Research |url=http://www.cepr.net/index.php/strengthening-the-middle-class-ensuring-equal-pay-for-women-testimony/ |title=Strengthening the Middle Class: Ensuring Equal Pay for Women |last=Boushey |first=Heather |date=April 24, 2007 |accessdate=March 26, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320025328/http://www.cepr.net/index.php/strengthening-the-middle-class-ensuring-equal-pay-for-women-testimony/|archivedate=March 20, 2012|df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on data from the 1980s, economists Blau and Kahn and Wood et al. separately argue that "free choice" factors, while significant, have been shown in studies to leave large portions of the gender earnings gap unexplained.&lt;ref name="Wood, Robert G. 1993. pp. 417–41"/&gt;&lt;ref name="aysps.gsu.edu"/&gt;

====Gender stereotypes====
Research suggests that gender stereotypes may be the driving force behind occupational segregation because they influence men and women's educational and career decisions.

Studies by Michael Conway et al., David Wagner and [[Joseph Berger (sociologist)|Joseph Berger]], John Williams and Deborah Best, and [[Susan Fiske]] et al. found widely shared cultural beliefs that men are more socially valued and more competent than women at most things, as well as specific assumptions that men are better at some particular tasks (e.g., math, mechanical tasks) while women are better at others (e.g., nurturing tasks).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Conway |first1=Michael |last2=Pizzamiglio |first2=M.

These "biased self-assessments" shape men and women's educational and career decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Correll |first1=Shelley J. |year=2001 |title=Gender and the Career Choice Process: The Role of Biased Self-Assessments |journal=American Journal of Sociology |volume=106 |issue=6 |pages=1691–730 |doi=10.1086/321299}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Correll |first1=Shelley J. |year=2004 |title=Constraints into Preferences: Gender, Status, and Emerging Career Aspirations |journal=American Sociological Review |volume=69 |pages=93–113 |jstor=3593076 |doi=10.1177/000312240406900106|citeseerx=10.1.1.520.8370 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, the [[OECD]] states that women's labour market behaviour "is influenced by learned cultural and social values that may be thought to discriminate against women (and sometimes against men) by stereotyping certain work and life styles as 'male' or 'female'." Further, the OECD argues that women's educational choices "may be dictated, at least in part, by their expectations that [certain] types of employment opportunities are not available to them, as well as by gender stereotypes that are prevalent in society."&lt;ref name="oecd.org"/&gt;

====Direct discrimination====
{{Further|Occupational sexism}}
Economist [[David Neumark]] argued that discrimination by employers tends to steer women into lower-paying occupations and men into higher-paying occupations.&lt;ref name="neumark"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Neumark|first1=David |last2=Bank |first2=Roy J. |last3=Van Nort |first3=Kyle D. |year=1996 |title=Sex Discrimination in Restaurant Hiring: An Audit Study |journal=The Quarterly Journal of Economics |volume=111 |issue=3 |pages=915–41 |jstor=2946676 |doi=10.2307/2946676}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bias favoring gender roles===
Several authors suggest that members of low-status groups are subject to negative [[stereotypes]] and attributes concerning their work-related competences.&lt;ref&gt;Fernandez, John P.

[[David R. Hekman]] and colleagues found that men receive significantly higher customer satisfaction scores than equally well-performing women. Customers who viewed videos featuring a female and a male actor playing the role of an employee helping a customer were 19% more satisfied with the male employee's performance and also were more satisfied with the store's cleanliness and appearance although the actors performed identically, read the same script, and were in exactly the same location with identical camera angles and lighting. In a second study, they found that male doctors were rated as more approachable and competent than equally well performing female doctors. They interpret their findings to suggest that customer ratings tend to be inconsistent with objective indicators of performance and should not be uncritically used to determine pay and promotion opportunities. They contend that customer biases have potential adverse effects on female employees' careers.&lt;ref&gt;Bakalar, Nicholas.

Similarly, a study (2000) conducted by economic experts [[Claudia Goldin]] from [[Harvard University]] and [[Cecilia Rouse]] from [[Princeton University]] shows that when evaluators of applicants could see the applicant's gender they were more likely to select men. When the applicants gender could not be observed, the number of women hired significantly increased.&lt;ref&gt;Weiner, Joann M. [http://www.politicsdaily.com/2009/12/07/no-its-not-your-imagination-were-biased-against-women/ "No, It's Not Your Imagination; We're Biased Against Women."] ''Politics Daily'', Retrieved on July 13, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Goldin |first1=Claudia |last2=Rouse |first2=Cecilia |year=1997 |title=Orchestrating Impartiality: The Impact of 'Blind' Auditions on Female Musicians |journal=American Economic Review |volume=90 |issue=4 |pages=715–42 |ssrn=225685 |jstor=117305 |doi=10.3386/w5903}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Neumark]], a Professor of Economics at the [[University of California, Irvine]], and colleagues (1996) found statistically significant evidence of sex discrimination against women in hiring. In an audit study, matched pairs of male and female pseudo-job seekers were given identical résumés and sent to apply for jobs as waiters and waitresses at the same set of restaurants. In high priced restaurants, a female applicant's probability of getting an interview was 35 percentage points lower than a male's and her probability of getting a job offer was 40 percentage points lower. Additional evidence suggests that customer biases in favor of men partly underlie the hiring discrimination. According to Neumark, these hiring patterns appear to have implications for sex differences in earnings, as informal survey evidence indicates that earnings are higher in high-price restaurants.&lt;ref name="neumark"/&gt;

On the other hand, a 2007 study showed that for identical resumes fewer replies were sent to men compared with women (it also showed that women do worse when they have children, while men do worse when they don't).&lt;ref name="Correll"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Getting a Job: Is There a Motherhood Penalty?|author1=Shelley J.

===Barriers in science===
In 2006, the [[United States National Academy of Sciences]] found that women in science and engineering are hindered by bias and "outmoded institutional structures" in academia. The report ''[[Beyond Bias and Barriers]]'' says that extensive previous research showed a pattern of unconscious but pervasive bias, "arbitrary and subjective" evaluation processes and a work environment in which "anyone lacking the work and family support traditionally provided by a 'wife' is at a serious disadvantage."&lt;ref&gt;Dean, Cornelia. [https://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/19/science/19women.html "Bias Is Hurting Women in Science, Panel Reports."] ''The New York Times'', September 19, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, a 1999 report on faculty at [[MIT]] finds evidence of differential treatment of senior women and points out that it may encompass not simply differences in salary but also in space, awards, resources and responses to outside offers, "with women receiving less despite professional accomplishments equal to those of their male colleagues."&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.mit.edu/fnl/women/women.html "A Study on the Status of Women Faculty in Science at MIT."] ''The MIT Faculty Newsletter'', Vol. XI, No. 4, March 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

Research finds that work by men is often subjectively seen as higher-quality than objectively equal or better work by women compared to how an actual scientific review panel measured scientific competence when deciding on research grants. The results showed that women scientists needed to be at least twice as accomplished as their male counterparts to receive equal credit&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wennerås |first1=Christine |last2=Wold |first2=Agnes |year=1997 |title=Nepotism and sexism in peer-review |journal=Nature |volume=387 |issue=6631 |pages=341–43 |pmid=9163412 |bibcode=1997Natur.387..341W |doi=10.1038/387341a0}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that among grant applicants men have statistically significant greater odds of receiving grants than equally qualified women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bornmann |first1=Lutz |last2=Mutz |first2=Rüdiger |last3=Daniel |first3=Hans-Dieter |year=2007 |title=Gender differences in grant peer review: A meta-analysis |journal=Journal of Informetrics |volume=1 |issue=3 |pages=226–38 |doi=10.1016/j.joi.2007.03.001|arxiv=math/0701537 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anti-female bias and perceived role incongruency===
Research on competence judgments has shown a pervasive tendency to devalue women's work and, in particular, prejudice against women in male-dominated roles which are presumably incongruent for women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Eagly |first1=Alice H. |last2=Makhijani |first2=Mona G. |last3=Klonsky |first3=Bruce G. |year=1992 |title=Gender and the evaluation of leaders: A meta-analysis |journal=Psychological Bulletin |volume=111 |issue=1 |pages=3–22 |doi=10.1037/0033-2909.111.1.3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Organizational research that investigates biases in perceptions of equivalent male and female competence has confirmed that women who enter high-status, male-dominated work settings often are evaluated more harshly and met with more hostility than equally qualified men.&lt;ref&gt;Collinson, David, David Knights, and Margaret Collinson.

Alice H. Eagly and Steven J. Karau (2002) argue that "perceived incongruity between the female gender role and leadership roles leads to two forms of prejudice: (a) perceiving women less favorably than men as potential occupants of leadership roles and (b) evaluating behavior that fulfills the prescriptions of a leader role less favorably when it is enacted by a woman. One consequence is that attitudes are less positive toward female than male leaders and potential leaders. Other consequences are that it is more difficult for women to become leaders and to achieve success in leadership roles."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Eagly |first1=Alice H. |last2=Karau |first2=Steven J. |year=2002 |title=Role congruity theory of prejudice toward female leaders |journal=Psychological Review |volume=109  |issue=3 |pages=573–98 |pmid=12088246 |doi=10.1037/0033-295X.109.3.573|citeseerx=10.1.1.460.315 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, research suggests that when women are acknowledged to have been successful, they are less liked and more personally derogated than equivalently successful men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Heilman |first1=Madeline E. |last2=Wallen |first2=Aaron S. |last3=Fuchs  |first3=Daniella |last4=Tamkins |first4=Melinda M. |title=Penalties for Success: Reactions to Women Who Succeed at Male Gender-Typed Tasks |journal=Journal of Applied Psychology |volume=89 |issue=3 |pages=416–27 |year=2004 |pmid=15161402 |doi=10.1037/0021-9010.89.3.416}}&lt;/ref&gt; Assertive women who display masculine, agentic traits are viewed as violating prescriptions of feminine niceness and are penalized for violating the status order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rudman |first1=Laurie A. |last2=Glick |first2=Peter |year=2001|title=Prescriptive Gender Stereotypes and Backlash Toward Agentic Women |journal=Journal of Social Issues |volume=57 |issue=4 |pages=743–62 |doi=10.1111/0022-4537.00239}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, a 2018 study analyzing the pay gap of [[Uber]] drivers showed the existence of a 7% gender disparity in hourly wages in a context where gender discrimination was impossible at the employer level (contracts and algorithms were gender blind) and where there was no evidence of discrimination at the rider level.&lt;ref name=uber/&gt;

===Maternity leave===
{{Further|Parental leave}}
The economic risk and resulting costs of a woman possibly leaving jobs for a period of time or indefinitely to nurse a baby is cited by many to be a reason why women are less common in the higher paying occupations such as CEO positions and upper management{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}.  It is much easier for a man to be hired in these higher prestige jobs than to risk losing a female job holder. In a survey conducted of about 500 managers in the Slater &amp;Gordon law firm, more than 40% of the managers agreed they generally hesitate to hire woman who fall in the age group of potentially bearing children or woman who already have children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/money/2014/aug/12/managers-avoid-hiring-younger-women-maternity-leave|title=40% of managers avoid hiring younger women to get around maternity leave|last=Association|first=Press|date=2014-08-11|newspaper=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas Sowell argued in his 1984 book ''Civil Rights'' that most of pay gap is based on marital status, not a "glass ceiling" discrimination. Earnings for men and women of the same basic description (education, jobs, hours worked, marital status) were essentially equal. That result would not be predicted under explanatory theories of "sexism".&lt;ref&gt;Sowell, Thomas, "Civil Rights: Rhetoric or Reality", 1984 (see Chapter 5, "The Special Case of Women") and "Markets and Minorities", 1981.{{page needed|date=October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it can be seen as a symptom of the unequal contributions made by each partner to child raising.

[[Stanford University]] professor Shelley Correll and colleagues (2007) sent out more than 1,200 fictitious résumés to employers in a large Northeastern city, and found that female applicants with children were significantly less likely to get hired and if hired would be paid a lower salary than male applicants with children. This despite the fact that the qualification, workplace performances and other relevant characteristics of the fictitious job applicants were held constant and only their parental status varied. Mothers were penalized on a host of measures, including perceived competence and recommended starting salary. Men were not penalized for, and sometimes benefited from, being a parent. In a subsequent audit study, Correll et al. found that actual employers discriminate against mothers when making evaluations that affect hiring, promotion, and salary decisions, but not against fathers.&lt;ref&gt;Folbre, Nancy.

Research has also shown there to be a "marriage premium" for men with labor economists frequently reporting that married men earn higher wages than unmarried men, and speculating that this may be attributable to one or more of the following causes: (1) more productive men marry at greater rates (attributing the marriage premium to selection bias), (2) men become more productive following marriage (due to labor market specialization by men and domestic specialization by women), or (3) employers favor married men. Lincoln (2008) found no support for the specialization hypothesis among full-time employed workers.&lt;ref name="Lincoln, Anne E 2008"/&gt; Some studies have suggested this premium is greater for men with children while others have shown fatherhood to have no effect on wages one way or the other.&lt;ref name="Lincoln, Anne E 2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="law.harvard.edu"&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Joni |last1=Hersch |first2=Leslie S. |last2=Stratton |date=October 2000 |title=Household Specialization and the Male Marriage Wage Premium |journal=Industrial and Labor Relations Review |volume=54 |issue=1 |pages=78–94 |jstor=2696033 |ssrn=241067 |doi=10.2307/2696033}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Eng Seng |last1=Loh |date=Summer 1996 |title=Productivity Differences and the Marriage Wage Premium for White Males |journal=The Journal of Human Resources |volume=31 |issue=3 |pages=566–89 |jstor=146266 |ssrn=3295 |doi=10.2307/146266}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Sanders |last1=Korenman |first2=David |last2=Neumark |date=Spring 1991 |title=Does Marriage Really Make Men More Productive? |journal=The Journal of Human Resources |volume=26 |issue=2 |pages=282–307 |jstor=145924 |doi=10.2307/145924}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hill, Martha 1979"&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Martha S. |last1=Hill |date=Autumn 1979 |title=The Wage Effects of Marital Status and Children |journal=The Journal of Human Resources |volume=14 |issue=4 |pages=579–94 |jstor=145325 |doi=10.2307/145325}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Orloff |first1=Ann |year=1996 |title=Gender in the Welfare State |journal=Annual Review of Sociology |volume=22 |pages=51–78 |jstor=2083424 |doi=10.1146/annurev.soc.22.1.51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Consciousness of gender stereotypes about negotiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Battle of the sexes: Stereotype confirmation and reactance in negotiations |last1=Kray |first1=Lara J. |last2=Thompson |first2=Leigh |last3=Galinsky |first3=Adam |year=2001 |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume=80 |issue=6 |pages=942–58 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.80.6.942 |pmid=11414376}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Small et al. suggest that "framing situations as opportunities for negotiation is particularly intimidating to women, as this language is inconsistent with norms for politeness among low-power individuals, such as women". Their study of pay negotiations found that women were less likely than men to negotiate when the behavior was labeled as "negotiating" but equally likely when the behavior was labeled as "asking".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Who goes to the bargaining table?

Riley and Babcock found that women are penalized when they try to negotiate starting salaries. Male evaluators tended to rule against women who negotiated but were less likely to penalize men; female evaluators tended to penalize both men and women who negotiated, and preferred applicants who did not ask for more. The study also showed that women who applied for jobs were not as likely to be hired by male managers if they tried to ask for more money, while men who asked for a higher salary were not negatively affected.&lt;ref&gt;Shankar, Vedantam.

However, a 2018 study analyzing the pay gap of [[Uber]] drivers showed that men earned 7% more than women in a context where salaries were not negotiated.&lt;ref name=uber/&gt;

===Danger wage premium===
The [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]] investigated job traits that are associated with wage premiums, and stated: "The duties most highly valued by the marketplace are generally cognitive or supervisory in nature.  Job attributes relating to interpersonal relationships do not seem to affect wages, nor do the attributes of physically demanding or dangerous jobs."&lt;ref&gt;Bureau of Labor Statistics. [http://www.bls.gov/opub/ted/1999/Oct/wk1/art02.htm ''Knowledge gets the biggest pay premium.''] TED article, October 5, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Economists Peter Dorman and Paul Hagstrom (1998) state that "The theoretical case for wage compensation for risk is plausible but hardly certain. If workers have utility functions in which the expected likelihood and cost of occupational hazards enter as arguments, if they are fully informed of risks, if firms possess sufficient information on worker expectations and preferences (directly or through revealed preferences), if safety is costly to provide and not a public good, and if risk is fully transacted in anonymous, perfectly competitive labor markets, then workers will receive wage premia that exactly offset the disutility of assuming greater risk of injury or death. Of course, none of these assumptions applies in full and if one or more of them is sufficiently at variance with the real world, actual compensation may be less than utility-offsetting, nonexistent, or even negative – a combination of low pay and poor working conditions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dorman |first1=Peter |last2=Hagstrom |first2=Paul |year=1998 |title=Wage Compensation for Dangerous Work Revisited |journal=Industrial and Labor Relations Review |volume=52 |issue=1 |pages=116–35 |ssrn=100330 |jstor=2525246 |doi=10.2307/2525246}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact==

===Economy===
An October 2012 study by the [[American Association of University Women]] found that over the course of a 35-year career, an American woman with a college degree will make about $1.2&amp;nbsp;million less than a man with the same education. Therefore, closing the pay gap by raising women's wages would have a stimulus effect that would grow the U.S. economy by at least 3% to 4%.&lt;ref&gt;Christianne Corbett and Catherine Hill (October 2012) [http://www.aauw.org/GraduatetoaPayGap/upload/AAUWGraduatingtoaPayGapReport.pdf "Graduating to a Pay Gap: The Earnings of Women and Men One Year after College Graduation"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121114190344/http://www.aauw.org/GraduatetoaPayGap/upload/AAUWGraduatingtoaPayGapReport.pdf |date=November 14, 2012 }} (Washington, DC: American Association of University Women)&lt;/ref&gt; Women currently make up 70 percent of Medicaid recipients and 80 percent of welfare recipients. Increasing women's workplace participation from its present rate of 76% to 84%, as it is in Sweden, the U.S. could add 5.1 million women to the workforce, again, 3% to 4% of the size of the U.S. economy.&lt;ref&gt;Laura Bassett (October 24, 2012) [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/24/gender-wage-gap-economic-stimulus_n_2007588.html "Closing The Gender Wage Gap Would Create 'Huge' Economic Stimulus, Economists Say"] ''Huffington Post''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pensions===
According to a report by the [[United States Congress Joint Economic Committee]], the gender pay gap jeopardizes women's retirement security. Of the multiple sources of income Americans rely on later in life, many are directly linked to a worker's earnings over his or her career. These include [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] benefits, based on lifetime earnings, and defined benefit pension distributions that are typically calculated using a formula based on a worker's tenure and salary during peak-earnings years. The persistent gender pay gap leaves women with less income from these sources than men. For example, older women's Social Security benefits are 71% of older men's benefits ($11,057 for women versus $15,557 for men in 2009). Incomes from public and private pensions based on women's own work were just 60% and 48% of men's pension incomes, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Congress Joint Economic Committee. [http://jec.senate.gov/public/?a=Files.Serve&amp;File_id=f6fda396-2623-4e99-817e-bf9387360326 ''The Gender Wage Gap Jeopardizes Women’s Retirement Security.''] April 12, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current policy solutions==

===Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009===
In 2009, President Barack Obama signed the [[Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act]]. This law extended the statute of limitations on cases where a worker found that they were receiving discriminatory pay, allowing them to sue and receive recompense more than six months after they received the pay. This was seen as a victory for those fighting against the gender wage gap, because if a woman at the end of her career found that she had been making less money than men who were doing the same work, she now had more than six months from the date of her last pay check to file a claim and possibly receive the wages that were denied.

==Popular culture reactions==
[[File:Genderpaystore.jpg|thumb|right|upright|A [[Pop-up retail|pop-up store]] titled "76 is Less Than 100", which promotes awareness on the gender pay gap, operated in [[Pittsburgh]], Pennsylvania during the month of April 2015.]]
To help raise awareness on the pay gap, a [[Pop-up retail|pop-up store]] named "76 is Less Than 100" operated during the month of April 2015 in the [[Garfield (Pittsburgh)|Garfield]] neighborhood of [[Pittsburgh]]. The nonprofit store, which sells arts and crafts designed by women, charges men full price while women get a 24% discount to reflect the pay gap between men and women in [[Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://pittsburgh.cbslocal.com/2015/04/24/discount-for-women-full-price-for-men-woman-opens-store-to-make-point-about-wage-gap/ Discount For Women, Full Price For Men: Woman Opens Store To Make Point About Wage Gap] [[KDKA-TV]] (April 24, 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wpxi.com/news/news/pittsburgh-pop-shop-taking-stand-women-equal-pay-d/nktM2/ Pittsburgh pop-up shop taking a stand for women on Equal Pay Day] [[WPXI]] (April 14, 2015)&lt;/ref&gt; The store made national headlines in the wake of [[Patricia Arquette]] referencing the pay gap at the [[87th Academy Awards]] two months before.&lt;ref&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com/Lifestyle/pittsburgh-pop-shop-charges-men-women/story?id=30612771 Pittsburgh Pop-Up Shop Charges Men More Than Women] [[ABC News]] (April 27, 2015)&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2015 the operators opened a second iteration in [[New Orleans]], titled "66&lt;100" to reflect the pay gap in [[Louisiana]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nola.com/business/index.ssf/2015/11/new_orleans_wage_inequality_sh.html Women get a deal, men pay full price at New Orleans pop-up highlighting gender wage gap] [[The Times-Picayune]] (November 12, 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Public figure reactions ===
[[Sheryl Sandberg]], COO of Facebook, is a strong advocate of closing the gender pay gap. In her book, ''[[Lean In]]'', she urges professional women to "lean in" to their careers, negotiate for higher salaries to decrease the pay gap, and to find supportive partners who will actively help raise children to help lessen the [[motherhood penalty]].&lt;ref&gt;Sandberg, Sheryl (2013). ''Lean In: Women, Work, and the Will to Lead''. New York: Alfred A. Knopf. {{ISBN|0385349947}}.&lt;/ref&gt; She is also the founder of [[LeanIn.Org]], which has run national social media campaigns using the hashtags #[[Ban Bossy|BanBossy]] and #LeanInTogether.

Oscar-winning American actress [[Jennifer Lawrence]] has also brought international attention to the gender pay gap with an essay in fellow pay gap advocate [[Lena Dunham]]'s ''[[Lenny Letter]].'' In her essay, she addresses the fact that she was paid less than her ''[[American Hustle]]'' co-stars, which was made public by the [[Sony Pictures Entertainment hack|Sony hacking scandal]]. She largely blamed herself for having "failed as a negotiator" and being focused on being liked. The essay highlighted that the gender pay gap exists for every industry and all across Hollywood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/10/18/opinions/burns-jennifer-lawrence-women-pay/index.html|title=What Jennifer Lawrence reveals about women, equal pay|last=Burns|first=Dasha|website=CNN|access-date=2016-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, these public reactions have been criticized for embodying [[white feminism]] because they do not take into account [[intersectionality]] and the increased obstacles that women of color face.&lt;ref&gt;"Demarginalising the Intersection of Race and Sex: A Black Feminist Critique of Anti-discrimination Doctrine, Feminist Theory, and Anti-racist Politics" by Kimberlé Crenshaw in ''Framing Intersectionality'', edited by Helma Lutz et al. (Ashgate, 2011).
&lt;/ref&gt; Intersectional feminists often find that white feminists attempt to speak for all women when relaying their experiences of the gender pay gap, when in reality their problems are not relatable to women of color who face an additional barrier of [[racism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Burgin | first1 = Say | year = 2016 | title = White Women, Anti-Imperialist Feminism And The Story Of Race Within The US Women's Liberation Movement | url = | journal = [[Women's History Review]] | volume = 25 | issue = 5| pages = 756–770 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Judeo-Moroccan Arabic''' is a [[Varieties of Arabic|variety]] of the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] Language spoken by [[Jew|Jewish]] people living or formerly living in [[Morocco]] and [[Algeria]]. Speakers of the language are usually older adults.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond G. Gordon Jr., ed.  2005.  ''Ethnologue:  Languages of the World''.  15th edition.  Dallas:  Summer Institute of Linguistics.&lt;/ref&gt;

The vast majority of [[Moroccan Jews]] and [[Algerian Jews]] have [[Moroccan Jews in Israel|relocated to Israel]] and have [[language shift|switched]] to using Hebrew as their [[home language]]. Those in France typically use French as their first language, while the few still left in Morocco and Algeria tend to use either French, Moroccan or Algerian Arabic in their everyday lives.

==History and composition==

===Historically===
Widely used in the Jewish community during [[History of the Jews in Morocco|its long history there]], the Moroccan dialect of [[Judeo-Arabic]] has many influences from languages other than [[Arabic]], including [[Spanish language|Spanish]] (due to the close proximity of [[Spain]]), [[Haketia]] or Moroccan Judeo-Spanish, due to the  influx of [[Sephardic]] refugees from Spain after the 1492 expulsion, and [[French language|French]] (due to the period in which Morocco was colonized by [[France]]), and, of course, the inclusion of many [[Hebrew]] loanwords and phrases (a feature of all [[Jewish languages]]). The dialect has considerable [[mutual intelligibility]] with [[Judeo-Tunisian Arabic]], and some with [[Judeo-Tripolitanian Arabic]], but almost none  with [[Judeo-Iraqi Arabic]].

===Today===
The vast majority of Morocco's 265,000 Jews emigrated to Israel after 1948, with significant emigration to Europe (mainly France) and North America as well. Although about 3,000 Jews remain in Morocco today,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ejpress.org/article/58013 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-05-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120518012629/http://www.ejpress.org/article/58013 |archivedate=2012-05-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; most of the younger generations speak French as their first language,{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} rather than Arabic, and their Arabic is more akin to [[Moroccan Arabic]] than to Judeo-Arabic. There are estimated to be 8,925 speakers in Morocco, mostly [[Casablanca]] and [[Fes]], and 250,000 in [[Israel]] (where speakers reported bilingualism with Hebrew). Most speakers, in both countries, are elderly. There is a Judeo-Arabic radio program on Israeli radio.

'''Julita Abbey''' was a [[monastery]] for [[Cistercian]] monks in the parish of [[Julita, Sweden|Julita]] in [[Oppunda Hundred]], [[Södermanland]], [[Sweden]].

The monastery was founded in 1160 at Viby, close to [[Sigtuna]], but under the patronage of King [[Knut Eriksson]], who donated land and a right to parts of the fishing at [[Älvkarleby]], it was moved in 1180 to ''Säby'' by the lake [[Öljaren]] in Julita. The monastery was therefore also known as ''Säby'', or ''Saba'' in Latin. It continued to receive rich donations from King [[Erik Knutsson]] (1210-1216), and later from other members of the aristocracy and royal circles. It was finally the owner of some 80 farms, mostly in Södermanland. At the time of the [[Protestant Reformation]], King [[Gustav I of Sweden|Gustavus Vasa]] appropriated the abbey in accordance with the [[Reduction of Gustav I of Sweden]] and gave it in [[fief]] to Olof Arvidsson, a bailiff in [[Nyköping]], in 1527. The secular estate thus created later had various possessors, including members of the [[Palbitzki]] and [[Lewenhaupt (Swedish noble family)|Lewenhaupt]] families.&lt;ref&gt;Torvald Höjer and Wbg (signatures), "Julita", ''Nordisk familjebok'', vol. 13 (1910), [http://runeberg.org/nfbm/0150.html col. 268 f]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1944, the [[Nordic Museum]] assumed the ownership of the estate in accordance with the will of the last private owner, Artur Bäckström.

== Origins ==
The system of [[bonded labour]] existed in Nepal since the 18th century; following the [[unification of Nepal]], members of the ruling elite received land grants in the Terai and were entitled to collect revenue from those who cultivated the land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Regmi, R. R. |year=1994 |title=Deforestation and rural society in the Nepalese Terai |journal=Occasional Papers in Sociology and Anthropology |issue=4 |pages=72–89 |url=https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/1325105.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kamaiya system bonds males to labour, and the Kamlari system bonds females.

== Kamaiya system ==
=== Kamaiya history ===
Traditionally, people without land or work could get loans from landowners allowing them to sustain a minimum livelihood. In exchange to this, they had to live and work on the landowner's land as quasi [[slaves]]. Exorbitant debts were charged, and whole families were forced to slave labour for years and even generations, bonded by indebtedness to the landowner and bonded by unequal social relations to sell labour in lieu of the loan taken.&lt;ref name="omct06"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.omct.org/files/interdisciplinary-study/ii_b_3_nepal_case_study.pdf |author=World Organization Against Torture (2006) |title=The Kamaiya System of Bonded Labour in Nepal |publisher=A study prepared by the World Organization Against Torture for the International Conference ''Poverty, Inequality and Violence: is there a human rights response?'' Geneva, 4–6 October 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the eradication of [[malaria]] in the [[Terai]] region in the 1950-60s, the large influx of hill migrants marginalized traditionally landowning [[Tharu people]] by occupying their lands. While the Tharus had no records of the land they were cultivating, the settlers registered the land in their name, forcing the Tharus to work as agricultural labourers. The customary practice of obtaining a "helping hand for family business" was gradually replaced by the forced labour system called Kamaiya, which in Tharu parlance is tantamount to hardworking hired farm labour.&lt;ref name="omct06"/&gt;
The Kamaiya system existed in particular in western Nepal and affects especially the Tharu people and [[Dalit]]s.

=== Kamaiya abolition ===
Increasing protests against the kamaiya system, organized by the "Kamaiya movement", led to its abolition in 2000. On 17 July that year, the Government of Nepal announced the Kamaiya system be banned, all Kamaiyas be freed and their debts be cancelled.&lt;ref name="omct06" /&gt; Although most Kamaiya families were freed, the system has persisted. Many Kamaiyas were evicted by their former landlords and released into poverty without any support. Others received land that was unproductive.&lt;ref name="msnepal"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ms.dk/sw14583.asp |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060904234645/http://www.ms.dk/sw14583.asp |archive-date=2006-09-04 |title=Kamaiya: Slavery and Freedom in Nepal |publisher=MS Nepal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To alleviate the poverty of the affected people&amp;nbsp;– the main cause of the system&amp;nbsp;– rehabilitation and distribution of land were promised to ex-Kamaiya families. To put action behind the attempts to discuss the land issue with the government, the ex-Kamaiyas started occupying land in [[Kailali District|Kailali]] and [[Bardiya District|Bardiya]] districts in the winter of 2005-06.&lt;ref name="msnepal"/&gt; But a decade after being liberated, the freed Kamaiyas are forced to live a very difficult life as the government has still not fulfilled its promises of providing a proper rehabilitation and relief package.&lt;ref name="nepalnews"&gt;{{cite news |title=Freed Kamaiyas still live difficult lives a decade after being liberated |url=http://www.nepalnews.com/index.php/sports-archive/19-news/general/7655-freed-kamaiyas-still-live-difficult-lives-a-decade-after-being-liberated |publisher=nepalnews.com |date=18 July 2010|access-date=23 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Kamlari system ==
=== Practice === 
In its modern form, girls and young women are sold by their parents into [[indentured servitude]] under contract for periods of one year with richer, higher-[[caste]] buyers, generally from outside their villages.&lt;ref name=chron/&gt; 

=== Campaigns for kamlari abolition ===
Several activist groups including the Nepal Youth Foundation (NYF) and the Friends of Needy Children (FNC) have campaigned for abolition of the system since 2000, and worked to free kamlaris by paying off their parents' debts.&lt;ref name="NYF"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.nepalyouthfoundation.org.uk/latest-news/nyf-celebrates-kamlari-freedom-day-27th-june/ |title=NYF celebrates Kamlari Freedom Day – 27th June |publisher=Nepal Youth Foundation |date=30 June 2016 |accessdate=2 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 10 September 2006,&lt;ref name="NYF"/&gt; the [[Supreme Court of Nepal]] affirmed that this practice known as kamlari was illegal,&lt;ref name="IPS"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ipsnews.net/2006/09/nepal-land-reforms-key-to-social-harmony/ |publisher=IPS |author=Pradhan, S. |title=Nepal: Land Reforms, Key to Social Harmony |date=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that former kamlaris were entitled to governmental compensation, education and rehabilitation.&lt;ref name="NYF"/&gt; However, the interim-government of Nepal (formed during the last stage of the [[Nepalese Civil War]] following the successful April 2006 revolution against the autocratic monarchy) failed to comply with the Supreme Court's ruling, and the practice continued to exist.&lt;ref name="NYF"/&gt;

Anti-kamlari organisations launched new campaigns and protests to demand the government to comply, which in 2009 resulted in financial compensation for freed kamlaris.&lt;ref name="NYF"/&gt; The system was still not abolished, however, and thousands of girls served forcefully for several more years.&lt;ref name="NYF"/&gt; Various charitable organizations have mitigated the ''kamlari'' practice by offering grants larger than prospective masters to families who promise not to sell their daughters, as well as funds for the girls' education.&lt;ref name=chron&gt;{{cite news |publisher=San Francisco Chronicle |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2009/02/08/MN7P15HD60.DTL |title=Olga's Girls |author=Meredith May |date=8 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The next year the Freed Kamlari Development Forum (FKDF) was formed by former slave girls with the help of NYF and FNC.&lt;ref name="NYF"/&gt; The suspicious death 12-year-old kamlari Srijana Chaudhary in March 2013 revived the movement and saw mass protests taking place to demand the practice's immediate end.&lt;ref name="Mottin"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Mottin |first=Monica |date=2018 |title=Rehearsing for Life: Theatre for Social Change in Nepal |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YHhTDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA166 |location=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=166 |isbn=9781108641036 |accessdate=2 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; After images of police hitting the protesting girls were seen in national and international media, outrage against the Nepalese government soared.&lt;ref name="Mottin"/&gt; In June 2013, the government finally gave in and officially abolished the kamlari system&lt;ref name="Mottin"/&gt; and agreed to a 10 point plan involving compensation, rehabilitation and justice for victims of abuse.&lt;ref name="NYF"/&gt;

=== Post-abolition practice ===
Despite the 2013 official prohibition on putting girls into indentured servitude, the NYF estimated in October 2017 that hundreds of girls were still living in slave-like conditions, many in the homes of prominent politicians and businessmen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2017/oct/18/i-lived-in-fear-nepalese-official-sold-as-a-slave-at-10-years-old-domestic-worker |title='My dream is coming true': the Nepalese woman who rose from slavery to politics |author=Kate Hodal |work=The Guardian |date=18 October 2017 |accessdate=2 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{History of Italy}}
The '''Kingdom of Italy''' ([[Latin language|Latin]]: ''Regnum Italiae'' or ''Regnum Italicum'', [[Italian language|Italian]]: ''Regno d'Italia'') was one of the constituent kingdoms of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], along with the kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Germany|Germany]], [[Kingdom of Bohemia|Bohemia]], and [[Kingdom of Arles|Burgundy]]. It comprised [[northern Italy|northern]] and [[central Italy]], but excluded the [[Republic of Venice]]. Its original capital was [[Pavia]] until the 11th century.

In 773, [[Charlemagne]], the [[King of the Franks]], crossed the Alps to invade the [[Kingdom of the Lombards]], which encompassed all of Italy except the [[Duchy of Rome]] and some [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] possessions in the south. In June 774, [[Siege of Pavia (773–74)|the kingdom collapsed]] and the Franks became masters of northern Italy. The southern areas remained under Lombard control as the [[Duchy of Benevento]] is changed into the rather independent Principality of Benevento. Charlemagne adopted the title "King of the Lombards" and in 800 was crowned [[Holy Roman Emperor|"Emperor of the Romans"]] in Rome. Members of the [[Carolingian dynasty]] continued to rule Italy until the deposition of [[Charles the Fat]] in 887, after which they once briefly regained the throne in 894–896. Until 961, the rule of Italy was continually contested by several aristocratic families from both within and outside the kingdom.

In 961, King [[Otto I of Germany]], already married to [[Adelaide of Italy|Adelaide]], widow of a previous king of Italy, invaded the kingdom and had himself crowned in Pavia on 25 December. He continued on to Rome, where he had himself crowned emperor on 7 February 962. The union of the crowns of Italy and Germany with that of the so-called "Empire of the Romans" proved stable. Burgundy was added to this union in 1032, and by the twelfth century the term "Holy Roman Empire" had come into use to describe it. From 961 on, the Emperor of the Romans was usually also King of Italy and Germany, although emperors sometimes appointed their heirs to rule in Italy and occasionally the Italian bishops and noblemen elected a king of their own in opposition to that of Germany. The absenteeism of the Italian monarch led to the rapid disappearance of a central government in the [[High Middle Ages]], but the idea that Italy was a kingdom within the Empire remained and emperors frequently sought to impose their will on the evolving [[Italian city-states]]. The resulting wars between [[Guelphs and Ghibellines]], the anti-imperialist and imperialist factions, respectively, were characteristic of Italian politics in the 12th–14th centuries. The [[Lombard League]] was the most famous example of this situation; though not a declared separatist movement, it openly challenged the emperor's claim to power.

By the 15th century, the power of the city-states was largely broken. A series of [[wars in Lombardy]] from 1423 to 1454 further reduced the number of competing states in Italy. The next forty years were relatively peaceful in Italy, but in 1494 the peninsula was invaded by [[Kingdom of France|France]]. The resulting [[Great Italian Wars]] lasted until 1559 as control of most of the Italian states passed to King [[Philip II of Spain]]. The [[Peace of Westphalia]], in 1648, formally ended the rule of the Holy Roman Emperors in Italy. But the Spanish branch of the [[Habsburg dynasty]]—the same dynasty of which another branch provided the Emperors—continued to rule most of Italy down to the [[War of the Spanish Succession]] (1701–1714). After the [[Imperial Reform]] of 1495–1512, the Italian kingdom corresponded to the [[Imperial Circle|unencircled]] territories south of the Alps. Juridically the emperor maintained an interest in them as nominal king and overlord, but the "government" of the kingdom consisted of little more than the plenipotentiaries the emperor appointed to represent him and those governors he appointed to rule his own Italian states. The Habsburg rule in Italy came to an end with the [[Italian campaigns of the French Revolutionary Wars|campaigns of the French Revolutionaries]] in 1792–1797, when a series of [[French client republic|client republics]] were set up. In 1806, the Holy Roman Empire was dissolved by the last emperor, [[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis II]], after its defeat by [[Napoleon]] at the [[Battle of Austerlitz]].

==Lombard kingdom==
{{main|Kingdom of the Lombards}}
After the [[Battle of Taginae]], in which the Ostrogoth king [[Totila]] was killed, the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] general [[Narses]] captured [[Rome]] and besieged [[Cumae]]. [[Teia]], the new Ostrogothic king, gathered the remnants of the Ostrogothic army and marched to relieve the siege, but in October 552 Narses ambushed him at ''Mons Lactarius'' (modern [[Monti Lattari]]) in [[Campania]], near [[Mount Vesuvius]] and [[Nuceria Alfaterna]]. The battle lasted two days and Teia was killed in the fighting. Ostrogothic power in Italy was eliminated, but according to Roman historian [[Procopius of Caesarea]], Narses allowed the Ostrogothic population and their Rugian allies to live peacefully in Italy under Roman sovereignty.&lt;ref&gt;De Bello Gothico IV 32, pp. 241-245&lt;/ref&gt; The absence of any real authority in Italy immediately after the battle led to an invasion by the [[Franks]] and [[Alemanni]], but they too were defeated in the [[Battle of the Volturnus (554)|battle of the Volturnus]] and the peninsula was, for a short time, reintegrated into the empire.
[[File:Iron Crown.JPG|thumb|left|The [[Iron Crown of Lombardy]], now at [[Monza Cathedral]]]]
The Kings of the [[Lombards]] ({{lang-la|reges Langobardorum|links=no}}, singular ''{{lang|la|rex Langobardorum|links=no}}'') ruled that [[Germanic people]] from their invasion of Italy in 567–68 until the Lombardic identity became lost in the ninth and tenth centuries. After 568, the Lombard kings sometimes styled themselves [[King of Italy|Kings of Italy]] ({{lang-la|rex totius Italiæ|links=no}}). Upon the Lombard defeat at the 774 [[Siege of Pavia (773–774)|Siege of Pavia]], the kingdom came under the Frankish domination of [[Charlemagne]]. The [[Iron Crown of Lombardy]] (''Corona Ferrea'') was used for the coronation of the Lombard kings, and the kings of Italy thereafter, for centuries.

The primary sources for the Lombard kings before the Frankish conquest are the anonymous 7th-century ''[[Origo Gentis Langobardorum]]'' and the 8th-century ''[[Historia Langobardorum]]'' of [[Paul the Deacon]]. The earliest kings (the pre-Lethings) listed in the ''Origo'' are almost certainly legendary. They purportedly reigned during the [[Migration Period]]; the first ruler attested independently of Lombard tradition is [[Tato]].

The actual control of the sovereigns of both the major areas that constitute the kingdom – ''[[Langobardia Major]]'' in the centre-north (in turn divided into a western, or [[Neustria (Lombard)|Neustria]], and one eastern, or [[Austria (Lombard)|Austria]] and [[Tuscany|Tuskia]]) and ''[[Langobardia Minor]]'' in the centre-south, was not constant during the two centuries of life of the kingdom. An initial phase of strong autonomy of the many constituent duchies developed over time with growing regal authority, even if the dukes' desires for autonomy were never fully achieved.

The Lombard kingdom proved to be more stable than its [[Ostrogothic kingdom|Ostrogothic]] predecessor, but in 774, on the pretext of defending the [[Papacy]], it was conquered by the [[Franks]] under [[Charlemagne]]. They kept the Italo-Lombard realm separate from their own, but the kingdom shared in all the partitions, divisions, civil wars, and succession crises of the [[Carolingian Empire]] of which it became a part until, by the end of the ninth century, the Italian kingdom was an independent, but highly decentralised, state.

==Constituent of the Carolingian Empire==
The death of the Emperor [[Lothair I]] in 855 led to his realm of [[Middle Francia]] being split among his three sons.  The eldest, [[Louis II of Italy|Louis II]], inherited the Carolingian lands in Italy, which were now for the first time (save the brief rule of [[Charlemagne]]'s son [[Pepin of Italy|Pepin]] in the first decade of the century), ruled as a distinct unit. The kingdom included all of Italy as far south as [[Rome]] and [[Spoleto]], but the rest of Italy to the south was under the rule of the [[Lombards|Lombard]] [[Principality of Benevento]] or of the [[Byzantine Empire]].

Following Louis II's death without heirs, there were several decades of confusion. The [[Holy Roman Empire|Imperial]] crown was initially disputed among the Carolingian rulers of [[West Francia]] ([[France]]) and [[East Francia]] ([[Germany]]), with first the western king ([[Charles the Bald]]) and then the eastern ([[Charles the Fat]]) attaining the prize. Following the deposition of the latter, local nobles – [[Guy III of Spoleto]] and [[Berengar I of Italy|Berengar of Friuli]] – disputed over the crown, and outside intervention did not cease, with [[Arnulf, Holy Roman Emperor|Arnulf]] of Eastern Francia and [[Louis the Blind]] of [[Provence]] both claiming the Imperial throne for a time. The kingdom was also beset by Arab raiding parties from [[Sicily]] and [[North Africa]], and central authority was minimal at best.

In the 10th century, the situation hardly improved, as various Burgundian and local noblemen continued to dispute over the crown. Order was only imposed from outside, when the German king [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto I]] invaded Italy and seized both the Imperial and Italian thrones for himself in 962.

==Imperial Italy==
In 951 King [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto I of Germany]] had married [[Adelaide of Italy|Adelaide of Burgundy]], the widow of late King [[Lothair II of Italy]]. Otto assumed the Iron Crown of Lombardy at [[Pavia]] despite his rival Margrave [[Berengar II of Italy|Berengar of Ivrea]]. When in 960 Berengar attacked the [[Papal States]], King Otto, summoned by [[Pope John XII]], conquered the Italian kingdom and on 2 February 962 had himself crowned [[Holy Roman Emperor]] at Rome. From that time on, the Kings of Italy were always also Kings of Germany, and Italy thus became a constituent kingdom of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], along with the [[Kingdom of Germany]] (''regnum Teutonicorum'') and – from 1032 – [[Kingdom of Arles|Burgundy]]. The [[List of German monarchs|German king]] (''[[King of the Romans|Rex Romanorum]]'') would be crowned by the [[Archbishop of Milan]] with the [[Iron Crown of Lombardy|Iron Crown]] in Pavia as a prelude to the visit to Rome to be crowned Emperor by the [[Pope]].

In general, the monarch was an absentee, spending most of his time in Germany and leaving the Kingdom of Italy with little central authority. There was also a lack of powerful landed magnates – the only notable one being the [[March of Tuscany|Margraviate of Tuscany]], which had wide lands in [[Tuscany]], [[Lombardy]], and the [[Emilia (region of Italy)|Emilia]], but which failed due to lack of heirs after the death of [[Matilda of Canossa]] in 1115. This left a power vacuum – increasingly filled by the Papacy and by the bishops, as well as by the increasingly wealthy Italian cities, which gradually came to dominate the surrounding countryside. Upon the death of Emperor [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto III]] in 1002, one of late Berengar's successors, Margrave [[Arduin of Ivrea]], even succeeded in assuming the Italian crown and in defeating the Imperial forces under Duke [[Otto I, Duke of Carinthia|Otto I of Carinthia]]. Not until 1004 could the new German King [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry II of Germany]], by the aid of Bishop [[Leo of Vercelli]], move into Italy to have himself crowned ''rex Italiae''. Arduin ranks as the last domestic "King of Italy" before the accession of [[Victor Emmanuel II of Italy|Victor Emmanuel II]] in 1861.

Henry's [[Salian dynasty|Salian]] successor [[Conrad II, Holy Roman Emperor|Conrad II]] tried to confirm his dominion against Archbishop [[Aribert (archbishop of Milan)|Aribert of Milan]] and other Italian aristocrats (''seniores''). While besieging [[Milan]] in 1037, he issued the ''[[Constitutio de feudis]]'' in order to secure the support of the ''vasvassores'' petty gentry, whose [[fief]]s he declared hereditary. Indeed, Conrad could stable his rule, however, the Imperial supremacy in Italy remained contested.

===Staufer===
[[File:12citaly.jpg|thumb|Imperial Italy (outlined in red) in the 12th and 13th centuries]]
The cities first demonstrated their increasing power during the reign of the [[Hohenstaufen]] Emperor [[Frederick Barbarossa]] (1152–1190), whose attempts to restore imperial authority in the peninsula led to a series of wars with the [[Lombard League]], a league of northern Italian cities, and ultimately to a decisive victory for the League at the [[Battle of Legnano]] in 1176, which forced Frederick to recognize the autonomy of the Italian cities.

Frederick's son [[Henry VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry VI]] actually managed to extend Hohenstaufen authority in Italy by his conquest of the Norman [[Kingdom of Sicily]], which comprised Sicily and all of Southern Italy. Henry's son, [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor]] – the first emperor since the 10th century to actually base himself in Italy – attempted to return to his father's task of restoring imperial authority in the northern Italian Kingdom, which led to fierce opposition not only from a reformed Lombard League, but also from the Popes, who had become increasingly jealous of their temporal realm in central Italy (theoretically a part of the Empire), and concerned about the hegemonic ambitions of the Hohenstaufen emperors.

Frederick II's efforts to bring all of Italy under his control failed as signally as those of his grandfather, and his death in 1250 marked the effective end of the Kingdom of Italy as a genuine political unit. Conflict continued between [[Ghibelline]]s (Imperial supporters) and [[Guelfs]] (Papal supporters) in the Italian cities, but these conflicts bore less and less relation to the origins of the parties in question.

===Decline===
The Italian campaigns of the Holy Roman Emperors decreased, but the Kingdom did not become wholly meaningless. In 1310 the [[House of Luxembourg|Luxembourg]] King [[Henry VII, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry VII of Germany]] with 5,000 men again crossed the Alps, moved into Milan and had himself crowned with the Iron Crown of Lombardy, sparking a Guelph rebellion under Lord [[Guido della Torre]]. Henry restored the rule of [[Matteo I Visconti]] and proceeded to Rome, where he was crowned Holy Roman Emperor by three cardinals in place of [[Pope Clement V]] in 1312. His further plans to restore the Imperial rule and to invade the [[Kingdom of Naples]] were aborted by his sudden death the next year.

Successive emperors in the 14th and 15th centuries were bound in the struggle between the rivaling Luxembourg, [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg]] and [[House of Wittelsbach|Wittelsbach]] dynasties. In the conflict with [[Frederick the Fair]], King [[Louis IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Louis IV]] (reigned until 1347) had himself crowned Emperor in Rome by [[Antipope Nicholas V]] in 1328. His successor [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]] also returned to Rome to be crowned in 1355. None of the Emperors forgot their theoretical claims to dominion as Kings of Italy. Nor did the Italians themselves forget the claims of the Emperors to universal dominion: writers like [[Dante Alighieri]] (died 1321) and [[Marsilius of Padua]] (c. 1275 – c. 1342) expressed their commitment both to the principle of universal monarchy, and to the actual pretensions of Emperors Henry VII and Louis IV, respectively.

The Imperial claims to dominion in Italy mostly manifested themselves, however, in the granting of titles to the various strongmen who had begun to establish their control over the formerly republican cities. Most notably, the Emperors gave their backing to the [[House of Visconti|Visconti]] of [[Milan]], and King [[Wenceslaus, King of the Romans|Wenceslaus]] created [[Gian Galeazzo Visconti]] [[Duke of Milan]] in 1395. Other families to receive new titles from the emperors included the [[House of Gonzaga|Gonzaga]] of [[Mantua]], and the [[House of Este|Este]] of [[Ferrara]] and [[Modena]].

==Aftermath: Shadow Kingdom==
By the beginning of the early modern period, the Kingdom of Italy still existed but was a mere shadow. Its territory had been significantly limited – the conquests of the [[Republic of Venice]], which considered itself independent of the Empire, in the "[[domini di Terraferma]]" had taken most of northeastern Italy outside the jurisdiction of the Empire, while the Popes claimed full sovereignty and independence in the [[Papal States]] in Central Italy. Nevertheless, the Emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], owing more to his inheritance of Spain and Naples than to his position as Emperor, was able to establish his dominance in Italy to a greater extent than any Emperor since [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]]. He drove the French from Milan, prevented an attempt by the Italian princes, with French aid, to reassert their independence in the [[League of Cognac]], [[Sack of Rome (1527)|sacked Rome]] and brought the Medici pope [[Pope Clement VII|Clement VII]] to submission, conquered Florence where he reinstalled the [[Medici]] as [[Duchy of Florence|Dukes of Florence]] (and later, [[Grand Duchy of Tuscany|Grand Dukes of Tuscany]]), and, upon the extinction of the [[Sforza]] line in Milan, claimed the territory as an imperial fief and installed his son [[Philip II of Spain|Philip]] as the new Duke.

This new Imperial dominance, however, did not remain with the Empire, in which Charles was succeeded by his brother [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand]], but rather was transferred by Charles to his son, who became [[King of Spain]].

Nevertheless, the Imperial claims to suzerainty remained, and were actually called forth in the early 17th century when the [[Duchy of Mantua]] fell vacant in 1627. Emperor [[Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand II]] used his rights as feudal overlord to prevent the heir, the French [[Duke of Nevers]], from taking over the Duchy, leading to the [[War of the Mantuan Succession]], a part of the much larger [[Thirty Years' War]]. In the early 18th century, during the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], imperial claims to [[suzerainty]] were used again to seize Mantua in 1708, which was now attached by the [[Austria]]n [[Habsburg]]s to the newly conquered [[Duchy of Milan]].

This was the last notable usage of Imperial power, as such, in Italy. The Austrians retained control of Milan and Mantua, and intermittently, other territories (notably [[Tuscany]] after 1737), but the claims to feudal overlordship had become practically meaningless. The imperial claims to Italy remained only in the secondary title of the [[Archbishop of Cologne|Archbishop-Elector of Cologne]] to be "Arch-Chancellor of Italy" and in the formal adherence of Emperor and Diet to various treaties resolving the succession of various northern Italian states which were still considered to be imperial fiefs. During the [[French Revolutionary Wars]], the Austrians were driven from Italy by [[Napoleon]], who set up republics throughout northern Italy, and by the [[Treaty of Campo Formio]] of 1797, Emperor [[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis II]] relinquished any claims over the territories that made up the Kingdom of Italy. The imperial reorganization carried out in 1799–1803 left no room for Imperial claims to Italy – even the Archbishop of Cologne was gone, [[German Mediatisation|secularized]] along with the other ecclesiastical princes. In 1805, while the Empire was still in existence, Napoleon, by now Emperor Napoleon I, claimed the crown of Italy for himself, putting the [[Iron Crown of Lombardy|Iron Crown]] on his head at [[Milan]] on 26 May 1805. The Empire itself was abolished the next year.

In [[Aztec mythology]], '''Metztli''' ({{IPA-nah|metstɬi|lang}}; '''Meztli''', '''Metzi''') was a god or goddess of the [[lunar deity|moon]], the night, and farmers. She or they were probably the same deity as [[Yohaulticetl]] and [[Coyolxauhqui]] and the male moon god [[Tecciztecatl]]; like the latter, she feared the sun because she feared its fire. Also referred to as the lowly god of worms who failed to sacrifice himself to become the sun, and became the moon instead, his face darkened by a rabbit.

== Mexican traces ==
The origin of the name of the [[Mexica]] probably derived from Metztli. For more detailed explanation see [[Toponymy of Mexico]].

== Legend ==
The Moon and Sun were at one time equally bright. It not being appropriate for gods to be equals, one of them threw a rabbit in the face of the other, and the one struck darkened to become today's moon. Henceforth it is possible to distinguish a figure of a rabbit on the moon's surface. During a full moon, the "Rabbit in the Moon" becomes readily visible.

== Otomi mythology ==
For the [[Otomi people]], Zäna was the Moon, the Queen of the Night, probably the main deity. They called her the Old Mother, who represented both Moon and Earth simultaneously. Her spouse, the Old Father, was the god of fire. The Otomi counted lunar months as a period from new moon to new moon. They gave every month 30 days.{{cn|date=January 2015}}

'''Mexican immigration to Cuba''' comprises people who emigrated from [[Mexico]] to [[Cuba]] and their descendants. Cuba is home to the most Mexicans living in the [[Caribbean]]. The waves of migration from Mexico to Cuba started from the 1970s, attracted by a mild climate and political stability.

The resident embassy of Mexico reported 2,752 Mexican citizens in Cuba in 2010, but estimates approximately 4,000 Mexican citizens crossing into the neighboring country for educational, business, commercial, industrial and tourist activities. The Mexican community has been primarily established in the city of [[Havana]].

Many people from Yucatán, Campeche, Quintana Roo, Veracruz, Jalisco, and Tamaulipas share ties of familiarity with Cubans following the [[Caste War]] and industrial trade ([[Porfiriato]]) that drove Mexicans to migrate to the island. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eclac.cl/migracion/imila/seleccion.asp?parametro=M%C9XICO_|N|M%C9XICO Investigación de la Migración Internacional en Latinoamérica (IMILA).]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Mayans were separated from their work, and they surreptitiously left with fugitive status prosecuted by the local authority. On the other hand, there were inherited debts, so that the children had to pay what the father could not have covered. This created a pattern, perpetuating dependence on the family and as the father came close to paying off his debt, the landowner was allowed to trade with their workers, establishing the slave market in Cuba.&lt;ref&gt;[[Carlos R. Menéndez]], ''"Historia del infame comercio de indios en Yucatán"'', 1922, Mérida, Yucatán&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, entire families formed indigenous human chains moved in from the mainland to the island. Under these conditions they lived and suffered, especially many Yucatán Mayans in the mid-nineteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Kenneth Turner]], [[México Bárbaro]], 1965, Costa Amic editores, México, D.F.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Nelson Reed]], The Caste War of Yucatan, Stanford University Press, 1964&lt;/ref&gt; Most were brought to [[Havana]] but others were brought to Cuba as farmers of sisal, sugarcane, and fodder in the provinces of [[Pinar del Río]], [[Matanzas]] and [[Camagüey]].

==Mexican communities==

===Yucatecans===
The [[Yucatán (state)|Yucatecans]], the largest Mexican community on Cuban soil, are distributed in [[Havana]], [[Pinar del Río]], and [[Matanzas]]. This community arrived in Mexico from the Spanish colonial period, as slaves were brought to the island to work the sugar plantations. Many other Yucatecans came during the [[Caste War]] in the nineteenth century. Migration from the Yucatán decreased in the twentieth century. 

The majority of the [[Korean diaspora]] in Cuba are descendants of immigrants from Yucatán.

'''Naŋa dama''', also known as '''Naŋa tegu''', is a [[Dogon language]] spoken in [[Mali]] that is only known from one report from 1953. Roger Blench reports that its nearest relative is the recently described [[Walo–Kumbe Dogon]], "with which it shares both lexicon and the feature that many nouns have a final -m." Hochstetler thinks they may be the same language. It may be close to [[Yanda Dogon]] (Blench) or [[Jam sai dialect|Jamsai tegu]] (Hochstetler).

'''New Zealand Association of Rationalists and Humanists''' (or '''NZARH''') is an organisation, established in 1927 in [[New Zealand]] for the promotion of [[rationalist movement|rationalism]] and [[secular humanism]].

The principal aims are stated as:
* To advocate a rational, humane, and secular view of life without reference to supernatural agencies and which is compatible with the scientific method.
* To promote a tolerant, responsible, and open society.
* To encourage open-minded enquiry into matters relevant to human co-existence and well-being.

NZARH is an associate member of the [[International Humanist and Ethical Union]].

==IHEU's Minimum statement on Humanism==

All member organisations of the IHEU are required by IHEU bylaw 5.1 to accept [http://www.iheu.org/bylaws] the IHEU Minimum statement on Humanism:

:"''Humanism is a democratic and ethical life stance, which affirms that human beings have the right and responsibility to give meaning and shape to their own lives. It stands for the building of a more humane society through an ethic based on human and other natural values in the spirit of reason and free inquiry through human capabilities. It is not theistic, and it does not accept supernatural views of reality''."

==Awards==
In 2000, NZARH was awarded a Bravo award by the [[New Zealand Skeptics]] for "issuing a challenge to visiting Australian Ellen Greve, aka [[Jasmuheen]], who claims to survive by breathing air and eating nothing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bravo Awards|url=http://skeptics.nz/awards/bravo|publisher=New Zealand Skeptics|accessdate=7 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Omoluabi''' is a philosophical and cultural concept that's native to the 
[[Yoruba people]]. It's used to describe a person of good character. The omoluabi concept signifies courage, hard work, humility and respect.&lt;ref&gt;Fola Kareem Olajoku - "''Nigeria: The Omoluabi Terminology''"&lt;/ref&gt; An omoluabi is a person of [[honor]] who believes in hard work, respects the rights of others, and gives to the community in deeds and in action. Above all, an omoluabi is a person of integrity.&lt;ref&gt;Dolapo Adeniji-Neill, PH.D. Adelphi University Ruth S. Ammon School of Education Garden City, NY - "''Omoluabi: The Way Of Human Being: An African Philosophy's Impact On Nigerian Voluntary Immigrants Educational And Other Life Aspirations''"&lt;/ref&gt;

The Omoluabi concept is an adjectival [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]] phrase, which has the words - "''Omo + ti + Olu-iwa + bi''" as its components. Literally translated and taken separately, ''omo'' means 'child', ''ti'' means 'that or which', ''Olu-iwa'' means the chief or master of ''Iwa'' (character), ''bi'' means 'born'. When combined, Omoluabi translates as "the baby begotten by the chief of iwa". Such a child is thought of as a paragon of excellence in character.&lt;ref&gt;Fayemi, Ademola Kazeem, Department of Philosophy, Lagos State University Ojo, Lagos - "''Human Personality and the Yoruba Worldview: An Ethico-Sociological Interpretation''"&lt;/ref&gt;

An omoluabi demonstrates and exhibits the inherent virtue and value of ''Iwapele''. Iwapele is ultimately the basis of moral conduct in [[Yoruba culture]] and a core defining attribute of an omoluabi. The most fundamental of these principles demonstrated by an omoluabi are;&lt;ref&gt;Abimbola, Wande (1975) ''“Iwapele: The Concept of Good Character in Ifa Literary Corpus”, Wande Abimbola (ed.) Yoruba Oral Tradition: Poetry in Music Dance and Drama'' (Ibadan: University of Ibadan Press).&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''Oro Siso'' (Spoken word, the Yoruba accord great respect for intelligent and expert use of language)
* ''Iteriba'' (Respect)
* ''Inu Rere'' (Good will, Having a good mind towards others)
* ''Otito'' (Truth)
* ''Iwa'' (Character)
* ''Akinkanju'' (Bravery)
* ''Ise'' (Hardwork)
* ''Opolo Pipe'' (Intelligence)

An individual can be termed an omoluabi irrespective of the religion the person adheres to. Consequently, some of the characteristics and traits of an omoluabi are considered virtues in many religions, for example, humility, truth and honesty are [[Christian]] and [[Muslim]] virtues.

'''Reddy''' (also [[transliterated]] as ''Raddi'', ''Reddi'', ''Reddiar'', ''Reddappa'', ''Reddy'') is a caste that originated in India, predominantly settled in [[Andhra Pradesh]] and [[Telangana]]. They are classified as a [[forward caste]].

The origin of the Reddy has been linked to the [[Rashtrakuta dynasty|Rashtrakutas]], although opinions vary. At one time they were a warrior caste and later became feudal overlords and peasant proprietors.&lt;ref name="Frykenberg1965"&gt;{{cite book |first=Robert Eric |last=Frykenberg |authorlink=Robert Eric Frykenberg |title=Guntur district, 1788–1848: A History of Local Influence and Central Authority in South India |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IUs1AQAAIAAJ |year=1965|publisher=Clarendon Press |page=275}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Subrahmanyam1975"&gt;{{cite book|author=Y.

==Origin theories==

According to [[Alain Daniélou]] and Kenneth Hurry, the Rashtrakuta and Reddy dynasties may both have been descended from the earlier dynasty of the Rashtrikas.&lt;ref name="DaniélouHurry2003"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Alain |last1=Daniélou |authorlink1=Alain Daniélou |first2=Kenneth |last2=Hurry |title=A Brief History of India |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Kwnv3I6qIosC&amp;pg=PA114 |year=2003 |publisher=Inner Traditions / Bear &amp; Co|isbn=978-0-89281-923-2|page=114}}&lt;/ref&gt; This common origin is by no means certain: there is evidence suggesting that the Rashtrakuta line came from the [[Yadava]]s in northern India and also that they may simply have held a common title. Either of these alternate theories might undermine the claim to a connection between them and the Reddys.&lt;ref name="Chopra2003"&gt;{{cite book |first=Pran Nath |last=Chopra |authorlink=Pran Nath Chopra |title=A Comprehensive History of Ancient India |volume=3 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gE7udqBkACwC&amp;pg=PA202 |accessdate=4 July 2011 |year=2003 |publisher=Sterling Publishers Pvt. Ltd |isbn=978-81-207-2503-4 |page=202}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Varna status==

The [[Varna (Hinduism)|varna]] designation of Reddys is a contested and complex topic. Even after the introduction of the varna concept to [[south India]], caste boundaries in south India were not as marked as in [[north India]], where the four-tier varna system placed the priestly [[Brahmin]]s on top followed by the [[Kshatriyas]], [[Vaishyas]], and [[Shudras]]. In south India, on the other hand, there existed only three distinguishable classes, the [[Brahmins]], the non-Brahmins and the [[Dalit]]s. The two intermediate [[dvija]] varnas&amp;nbsp;— the Kshatriyas and Vaishyas&amp;nbsp;— did not exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Ayesha |last=Jalal |title=Democracy and Authoritarianism in South Asia: A Comparative and Historical Perspective |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GNJHlFTPBT0C&amp;pg=PA204 |year=1995 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-47862-5 |page=204}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Jean Alphonse |last=Bernard |title=From Raj to the Republic: A Political History of India, 1935–2000 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dP9tAAAAMAAJ |year=2001 |publisher=Har Anand Publications |page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=M.

The dominant castes of south India, such as Reddys and [[Nair]]s, held a status in society analogous to the Kshatriyas and Vaishyas of the north with the difference that religion did not sanctify them,&lt;ref name="Lohia1964"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Joseph2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=M.

Historically, land-owning castes like the Reddys have belonged to the regal ruling classes and are analogous to the Kshatriyas of the Brahmanical society.&lt;ref name="Richman2001"&gt;{{cite book |first=Paula |last=Richman |title=Questioning Rāmāyaṇas: a South Asian tradition |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7RW6MrAiJ-0C&amp;pg=PA176 |year=2001 |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=978-0-520-22074-4 |page=176}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Brahmins, on top of the hierarchical social order, viewed the ruling castes of the south like the Reddys, Nairs and [[Vellalar]]s as sat-Shudras meaning shudras of "true being”. Sat-shudras are also known as clean shudras, upper shudras, pure or high-caste shudras.&lt;ref name="Hudson2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=D.

==History==
===Medieval history===

====Kakatiya period====

[[File:Kondavid-drug. Signed 'W.R.'.jpg|thumb|right|Water colour painting&amp;nbsp;– Kondavidu fort, Reddy Kingdom]]

During the [[Kakatiya dynasty|Kakatiya period]], ''Reddi'', together with its variant ''Raddi'', was used as a status title (''gaurava-vachakamu''). The title broadly represented the category of village headmen irrespective of their hereditary background.{{sfn|Talbot, Pre-colonial India in Practice|2001|pp=55,&amp;nbsp;59}}

The [[Kakatiya dynasty|Kakatiya]] prince Prola I (c. 1052 to 1076) was referred to as "Prola Reddi" in an inscription.&lt;ref name="Diskalkar1993"&gt;{{citation|last=Diskalkar|first=D. B.|title=Sanskrit and Prakrit Poets Known from Inscriptions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S_gHAQAAMAAJ|year=1993|publisher=Anandashram Samstha|p=122}} Quote: "Balasarasvati, author of an inscription dated S. 1135 [c. 1057 CE] had lived at the court of Prola Reddi, ruler of the same Kakatiya [dynasty]."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Archaeological Survey of India |authorlink=Archaeological Survey of India |title=Indian Archaeology: A Review |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y_9tAAAAMAAJ |year=2000|publisher=Archaeological Survey of India |page=123}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the Kakatiyas became independent rulers in their own right, various subordinate chiefs under their rule are known to have used the title Reddi.&lt;ref name="Devi1993"&gt;{{citation|last=Devi|first=Yashoda|title=The History of Andhra Country, 1000 A.D.-1500 A.D.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-d9IAvFOUHsC&amp;pg=PA100|date=1 January 1993|publisher=Gyan Publishing House|isbn=978-81-212-0438-5|page=65}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Talbot, Pre-colonial India in Practice|2001|p=98}} Reddy chiefs were appointed as generals and soldiers under the Kakatiyas. Some Reddys were among the feudatories of Kakatiya ruler Pratapa Rudra.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} During this time, some of the Reddys carved out feudal principalities for themselves. Prominent among them were the [[Munagala]] Reddy chiefs. Two inscriptions found in the [[Zamindar]]i of Munagala at Tadavayi, two miles west of Munagala—one dated 1300 CE, and the other dated 1306 CE  show that the Munagala Reddy chiefs were feudatories to the Kakatiya dynasty. The inscriptions proclaim Annaya Reddy of Munagala as a chieftain of Kakatiya ruler Pratapa Rudra.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

The Reddy feudatories fought against attacks from the [[Delhi sultanate]] and defended the region from coming under the Turkic rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Giri S. |last1=Dikshit |first2=Saklespur |last2= Srikantaya |first3=Bi.

====Reddy dynasty====
{{Main article|Reddy dynasty}}

[[File:Upstairs at the palace, Kondapalli, Kistna District.jpg|thumb|right|Palace ruins, Kondapalli fort, Reddy Kingdom]]
After the death of Pratapa Rudra in 1323 CE and the subsequent fall of the [[Kakatiya dynasty|Kakatiya empire]], some Reddy chiefs became independent rulers.

====Vijayanagara period====

[[File:Vellorefort.jpg|thumb|right| Vellore fort built by Bommi Reddi in the 16th Century]]

The post-Kakatiya period saw the emergence of [[Vijayanagara Empire]] as well as the Reddy dynasty.&lt;ref name="Sriramamurti1972"/&gt; Initially, the two kingdoms were locked up in a territorial struggle for supremacy in the coastal region of Andhra. Later, they united and became allies against their common archrivals—the [[Bahmani Sultanate|Bahmani sultans]] and the Recherla Velamas of Rachakonda who had formed an alliance. This political alliance between Vijayanagara and the Reddy kingdom was cemented further by a matrimonial alliance. [[Harihara II]] of Vijayanagara gave his daughter in marriage to [[Reddy dynasty#Kataya Vema Reddy|Kataya Vema Reddy]]’s son Kataya. The Reddy rulers exercised a policy of annexation and invasion of [[Kalinga (historical region)|Kalinga]] (modern day [[Odisha]]). However, the [[suzerainty]] of Kalinga rulers was to be recognised. In 1443 CE, determined to put an end to the aggressions of the Reddy kingdom, the [[Gajapati Kingdom|Gajapati]] ruler [[Kapilendradeva|Kapilendra]] of Kalinga formed an alliance with the Velamas and launched an attack on the Reddy kingdom. [[Reddy dynasty#Veerabhadra Reddy|Veerabhadra Reddy]] allied himself with Vijayanagara ruler [[Deva Raya II|Devaraya II]] and defeated Kapilendra. After the death of Devaraya II in 1446 CE, he was succeeded by his son, [[Mallikarjuna Raya]]. Overwhelmed by difficulties at home, Mallikarjuna Raya recalled the Vijayanagara forces from Rajahmundry. Veerabhadra Reddy died in 1448 CE. Seizing this opportunity, Kapilendra sent an army under the leadership of his son Hamvira into the Reddy kingdom, took Rajahmundry and gained control of the Reddy kingdom.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}} The Gajapatis eventually lost control after the death of Kapilendra, and the territories of the former Reddy kingdom came under the control of the Vijayanagara Empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Hermann |last1=Kulke |authorlink1=Hermann Kulke |first2=Dietmar |last2= Rothermund |authorlink2=Dietmar Rothermund |title=A history of India |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TPVq3ykHyH4C|accessdate=16 August 2011|year=2004|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-32919-4|page=189}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, Reddys became the military chieftains of the Vijayanagara rulers. They along with their private armies accompanied and supported the Vijayanagara army in the conquest of new territories. These chieftains were known by the title of [[Palaiyakkarar|Poligar]]s.&lt;ref name="Reddy2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=A. Ranga Reddy|title=The State of Rayalaseema |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_g9T8UoCeO4C&amp;pg=PA215|accessdate=15 July 2011|year=2003|publisher=Mittal Publications|isbn=978-81-7099-814-3|pages=215, 333}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Reddy poligars were appointed to render military services in times of war, collect revenue from the populace and pay to the royal treasury. The chieftains exercised considerable autonomy in their respective provinces. The ancestors of the legendary [[Uyyalawada Narasimha Reddy]]&amp;nbsp;– who led an armed rebellion against the [[East India Company|British East India company]], were poligars.&lt;ref name="Dept1992"&gt;{{cite book|author=Andhra Pradesh (India).

Once independent, the erstwhile chiefs of the Vijayanagara empire indulged in several internal squabbles for supremacy in their areas. This constant warring between powerful feudal warlords for fiefdoms and power manifests itself even in modern-day Rayalaseema in the form of a brutally violent phenomenon termed as “[[Rayalaseema#Factionism|factionalism]]”, “factional violence” or simply “faction”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Seshan in Kurnool |first=K. |last=Balagopal |journal=Economic and Political Weekly |volume=29 |issue=30 |date=23 July 1994 |page=1905 |jstor=4401511 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern history===

====Golkonda period====
During this period, Reddys ruled several "samsthanams" (tributary estates)&lt;ref name="dsal.uchicago.edu" /&gt; in the [[Telangana]] area. They ruled as [[vassal]]s of [[Golkonda]] sultans. Prominent among them were Ramakrishna Reddy, Pedda Venkata Reddy and Immadi Venkata Reddy. In the 16th century, the Pangal fort situated in [[Mahbubnagar]] district of Andhra Pradesh was ruled by Veera Krishna Reddy. Immadi Venkata Reddy was recognised by the Golkonda sultan [[Abdullah Qutb Shah]] as a regular provider of military forces to the Golkonda armies.&lt;ref name="Cohen2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=Benjamin B.

====British period====
One of most prominent figures from the community during the British period is Uyyalawada Narasimha Reddy. He challenged the British and led an armed rebellion against the [[East India Company|British East India company]] in 1846. He was finally captured and hanged in 1847. His uprising was one of the earlier rebellions against the British rule in India, as it was 10 years before the famous [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]].&lt;ref name="Ramachandran2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=D.

Reddys were the [[landed gentry]] known as the [[deshmukh]]s and part of the [[Nizam of Hyderabad|Nizam of Hyderabad's]] administration.&lt;ref name="Chhotray2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Vasudha Chhotray|title=The Anti-Politics Machine in India: State, Decentralization and Participatory Watershed Development |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Kx1N6tyVXtwC&amp;pg=PA96&amp;dq=reddy+deshmukhs&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=N5gmTpD2KYPRrQfO3tnYDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=book-thumbnail&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCsQ6wEwADgK#v=onepage&amp;q=reddy%20deshmukhs&amp;f=false |accessdate=20 July 2011 |date=1 March 2011 |publisher=Anthem Press|isbn=978-0-85728-767-0|pages=96–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Reddy landlords styled themselves as ''Desais'', ''Doras'' and ''Patel''. Several Reddys were noblemen in the court of Nizam [[Nawab]]s and held many high positions in the Nizam's administrative set up. Raja Bahadur Venkatarama Reddy was made [[Kotwal]] of [[Hyderabad, India|Hyderabad]] in 1920 CE during the reign of the seventh Nizam [[Osman Ali Khan, Asaf Jah VII]]. Raja Bahadur Venkatarama Reddy was the first Hindu to be made kotwal of Hyderabad as in the late 19th and early 20th century, during the Islamic rule of the Nizams, the powerful position of Kotwal was held only by Muslims. His tenure lasted almost 14 years and he commanded great respect among the public for his outstanding police administration.&lt;ref name="Bawa1992"&gt;{{cite book|author=Basant K.

Several Reddys were at the forefront of the anti-Nizam movement. In 1941, communist leaders [[Raavi Narayana Reddy]] and [[Baddam Yella Reddy]] transformed the [[Andhra Mahasabha]] into an anti-Nizam united mass militant organisation and led an armed struggle against the Nizam's regime.&lt;ref name="Sundarayya2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Puccalapalli Sundarayya|title=Telangana People's Struggle and Its Lessons |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TPjIh1G0TmcC&amp;pg=PA12 |accessdate=21 July 2011|date=6 March 2006|publisher=Foundation Books|isbn=978-81-7596-316-0|pages=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Fascism in Romania}}
The '''Romanian Youth Labor''' (Munca Tineretului Român – MTR) was a [[paramilitary]] movement present in [[Romania]] during 1942-1944.

==History==
Having as an inspiration source the German [[Reichsarbeitsdienst]] (Reich Labour Service) organization (1934–1945), the Romanian political system ruled by gen. [[Ion Antonescu]] tried to avoid the Romanian youth to enroll in the [[Iron Guard]].&lt;ref&gt;prof. Dr. Stelian Neagoe, ''[http://www.jurnalul.ro/stire-istorie-politica/din-insemnarile-zilnice-ale-lui-constantin-argetoianu-vi-539101.html Din însemnările zilnice ale lui Constantin Argetoianu]'', Jurnalul, Mar. 21, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The Law no. 425 from 15 May 1941 regulated the unemployed compulsoriness to work for civic use (for both the Romanians and Jews).&lt;ref&gt;Dan Grecu, ''[http://membres.multimania.fr/dgrecu/EvreiCFR.html Detașamentele exterioare de muncă pentru evrei din județul Hunedoara (1941-1943)]'', The Romanian Postal-History&lt;/ref&gt; Being focused on the youth paramilitary training, Romanian Youth Labour aimed at educating its members in the spirit of the social labor and training them for building civil works: viaducts, aqueducts, tunnels, bridges and roads.&lt;ref name="enciclopedia sportiva"&gt;prof. dr. Nicu Alexe și colectiv, ''Enciclopedia Educației Fizice și Sportului din România'',vol.II - {{ISBN|973-85940-0-6}}, p.51, Editura Aramis, București, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization headquarters was in [[Breaza]], in the same building where the Military High School is placed today. The Commanders’ Center of [[Straja Ţării]] was also located there between 1937-1940.
The center was coordinated by gen. Emil Pălăngeanu and lt. col. [[Ioan Dem. Dimăncescu]].&lt;ref name="enciclopedia sportiva"/&gt;

The organization ceased its activity after August 23, 1944 when [[King Michael Coup|Romania switched sides]] from the [[Axis powers|Axis]] to [[Allies of World War II|the Allies]].

'''Stereotypes of indigenous peoples of Canada and the United States''' include many [[ethnic stereotype]]s found worldwide which include historical misrepresentations and the oversimplification of hundreds of indigenous cultures. Negative stereotypes are associated with prejudice and discrimination that continue to impact the lives of [[indigenous peoples]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.hcn.org/articles/tribal-affairs-why-dont-anti-indian-groups-count-as-hate-groups| title=Why don’t anti-Indian groups count as hate groups?| author=Anna V.

[[Indigenous peoples of the Americas]] are commonly called [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]], [[Alaska Natives]] or [[First Nations]] (in [[Canada]]).&lt;ref name="fleming"&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1G1-154514926/myths-and-stereotypes-about-native-americans-most|author=Walter C.

Eskimo itsef is an [[Exonym and endonym|an exonym]], deriving from phrases that [[Algonquin people|Algonquin tribes]] used for their northern neighbors.&lt;ref name="Waite2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Maurice Waite|title=Pocket Oxford English Dictionary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xqKcAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA305|year=2013|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-966615-7|page=305|quote=Some people regard the word Eskimo as offensive, and the peoples inhabiting the regions of northern Canada and parts of Greenland and Alaska prefer to call themselves Inuit}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is believed that some portrayals of natives, such as their depiction as bloodthirsty [[Barbarian|savages]] have disappeared. However, most portrayals are oversimplified and inaccurate; these stereotypes are found particularly in popular media which is the main source of mainstream images of Indigenous peoples world-wide.&lt;ref name="Media Smarts"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://mediasmarts.ca/diversity-media/aboriginal-people/common-portrayals-aboriginal-people|title = Common Portrayals of Aboriginal People|date = |accessdate = October 19, 2018|website = Media Smarts: Canada's center for digital and media literacy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mihesuah"&gt;{{cite book|title=American Indians: Stereotypes and Realities|author=Devon A. Mihesuah|isbn=0-932863-22-1|publisher=Clarity Press, Inc|location=Atlanta, GA|year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stereotyping of Native Americans must be understood in the context of history which includes [[Conquest (military)|conquest]], [[forced displacement]], and organized efforts to eradicate native cultures, such as the [[Native American boarding schools|boarding schools]] of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, which separated young Native Americans from their families in order to educate and to [[Cultural assimilation|assimilate]] them as [[European Americans]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apa.org/pi/oema/resources/policy/mascots-justif.pdf|title=APA Resolution Justifications|year=2005|publisher=American Psychological Association|accessdate=2013-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Indigenous terminology==
{{further|Native American name controversy}}
The first difficulty in addressing stereotypes is the terminology to use when referring to Indigenous peoples, which is an ongoing controversy. The truly stereotype-free names would be those of individual nations. A practical reference to Indigenous peoples in general is "Native American" in the United States and "First Nations" or "Aboriginal" in Canada.&lt;ref name="fleming" /&gt; The peoples collectively referred to as [[Inuit]] have their own unique stereotypes. The communities to which Indigenous peoples belong also have various names, typically "nation" or "tribe" in the United States, but "comunidad" (Spanish for "community") in South America.&lt;ref name="NMAI"&gt;{{cite book |author=National Museum of the American Indian |title=Do All Indians Live in Tipis? |location=New York |publisher=HarperCollins |date=2007 |isbn=978-0-06-115301-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All global terminology must be used with an awareness of the stereotype that "Indians" are a single people, when in fact there are hundreds of individual [[ethnic group]], who are all native to the [[Americas]]. This type of awareness is obvious when European Americans refer to [[Ethnic groups in Europe|Europeans]] with an understanding that there are some similarities, but many differences between the peoples of an entire continent.&lt;ref name="mihesuah"/&gt;

==American Indians / Native Americans==
{{further|Racism in the United States#Native Americans}}
{{quote box|width=50%|align=right|quote=Since the first Europeans made landfall in North America, native peoples have suffered under a weltering array of stereotypes, misconceptions and caricatures. Whether portrayed as ''[[noble savage]]s'', ''ignoble savages'', ''teary-eyed environmentalists, drunken, living off the Government, [[Indian princess]]/[[Squaw]]'' or most recently, simply as ''casino-rich'', native peoples find their efforts to be treated with a measure of respect and integrity undermined by images that flatten complex tribal, historical and personal experience into one-dimensional representations that tells us more about the depicters than about the depicted.|author=Carter Meland (Anishinaabe heritage) and David E. Wilkins (Lumbee), professors of Native American Studies at the University of Minnesota.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=The Star Tribune|title=Stereotypes in sports, chaos in federal policy|author1=Carter Meland | author2=David E. Wilkins|date=November 22, 2012|url=http://www.startribune.com/opinion/commentaries/180435801.html?refer=y|accessdate=2013-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
All of the [[myth]]s about Native Americans can be understood in the context of the [[metanarrative]] of the United States, which was originally "[[manifest destiny]]" and has now become "[[American exceptionalism]]". Myths and stereotypes persist because they fit into these narratives, which Americans use to understand their own history.&lt;ref name=Dunbar-Ortiz.2016&gt;{{cite book| title=All the Real Indians Died Off: And 20 Other Myths About Native Americans| first1=Roxanne | last1=Dunbar-Ortiz| first2=Dina | last2=Gilio-Whitaker| ISBN=978-080706265-4| year=2016| publisher=Beacon Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stereotypes may be grouped with regard to different characteristics: historical, cultural, and racial.

===Historical misconceptions===
There are numerous distortions of history, many of which continue as stereotypes.

There is the myth that Indians are a dying race, i.e. "The Vanishing Red Man", when in fact census data shows an increase in the number of individuals who were American Indians and Alaska Natives or American Indian and Alaska Native in combination with one or more other races.&lt;ref name="fleming" /&gt;

There is an assumption that Indians lost possession of their land because they were inferior,&lt;ref name="mihesuah"/&gt; when the reality is:
#Many of the indigenous peoples died from diseases to which they had no immunity
#There were a number of advanced civilizations in the Americas,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus|author=Charles C. Mann|publisher=Knopf|year=2005|isbn=1-4000-3205-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; but they did lack two important resources: a [[pack animal]] large enough to carry a human; and the ability to make [[steel]] for tools and weapons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Diamond, J. | title=Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies | publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Company | date=March 1997 | isbn=0-393-03891-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One stereotype held by non-Indians is that Indians receive special privileges that other American citizens do not. This view is based upon failure to understand the nature of the relationship between Native tribes and the [[Federal government of the United States]]. Tribes signed treaties that grant certain rights in exchange for the cession of land, therefore, many of these "privileges" are considered treaty obligations. So education and health care have been "bought and paid for" by Native ancestors.&lt;ref name="fleming" /&gt;

Today, Native Americans are perceived to have become wealthy due to casino revenues. Not all tribes own tribal gaming operations/establishments and many tribal groups have issues related to tribal ancestry, such as not being able to obtain paychecks unless they can not prove their tribal membership roll.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

====Purchase of Manhattan====
The "purchase" of [[Manhattan island]] from Indians is a cultural misunderstanding. In 1626 the director of the Dutch settlement, [[Peter Minuit]], traded sixty guilders worth of goods with the Lenni [[Lenape]], which they would have accepted as a gifts in exchange for allowing the settlers to occupy the land. Native Americans had no conception of private ownership of natural resources.&lt;ref name="NMAI"/&gt;

====Pocahontas====
The story told by [[John Smith (explorer)|John Smith]] of his rescue by the daughter of [[Powhatan]] is generally agreed to be untrue. [[Pocahontas]] would have been eleven or twelve at the time, so this popular tale of the "Indian Princess" and the Englishman has no basis in known facts.&lt;ref name="NMAI"/&gt;

===Cultural and ethnic misconceptions===
The Media Awareness Network of Canada (MNet) has prepared a number of statements about the portrayals of American Indians, First Nations of Canada and Alaskan Natives in the media. [[Western (genre)|Westerns]] and documentaries have tended to portray Natives in stereotypical terms: the wise elder, the aggressive drunk, the Indian princess, the loyal sidekick, obese and impoverished. These images have become known across North America. Stereotyped issues include simplistic characterizations, romanticizing of Native culture and stereotyping by omission—showing American Indians in a historical rather than modern context.&lt;ref name="Media Smarts"/&gt;

Native Americans were also portrayed as fierce warriors and braves, often appearing in school sports teams' names until such team names fell into disfavor in the later 20th century. Many school team names have been revised to reflect current sensibilities, though professional teams such as American football's [[Kansas City Chiefs]] and [[Washington Redskins]], baseball's [[Atlanta Braves]], and ice hockey's [[Chicago Blackhawks]] continue. Some [[Native American Mascot Controversy|controversial upper-level Native American team mascots]] such as [[Chief Noc-A-Homa]] and [[Chief Illiniwek]] have been discontinued, while some such as [[Chief Osceola and Renegade]] remain. A controversy over the [[Fighting Sioux]] nickname and logo was resolved in 2012.

There have been ongoing issues with the continuation of professional team names and mascots especially in the [[Washington Redskins name controversy]]. In 2013, President Obama and NBC sportscaster Bob Costas voiced their objection to the name. After a petition, the Trademark and Trial Appeal Board ordered the cancellation of six federal trademark registrations in 2014. The Redskins are appealing this ruling.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/apps/g/page/local/timeline-the-furor-over-the-redskins-name/2035/|title=Timeline: The furor over the Redskins' name|website=Washington Post|language=en|access-date=2018-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The use of [[Geronimo]] [[Code name Geronimo controversy|as the code name]] for [[Osama bin Laden]] in the [[Death of Osama bin Laden|operation that killed him]] is seen by some Native Americans as the continued stereotyping of Indians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://newsfeed.time.com/2011/05/03/why-geronimo-for-some-bin-laden-code-name-holds-anti-native-american-implications/|title=Why ‘Geronimo?’ For Some, Bin Laden Code Name Holds Anti-Native American Implications|author=Allie Townsend|date=May 3, 2011|publisher=Time Magazine|accessdate=November 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is the outdated stereotype that American Indians and Alaskan Natives live on reservations when in fact only about 25% do, and a slight majority now live in urban areas.&lt;ref name="fleming" /&gt;

There is an assumption that Indians somehow have an intuitive knowledge of their culture and history, when the degree of such knowledge varies greatly depending upon the family and community connections of each individual.&lt;ref name="fleming"/&gt;

=== Indigenous women ===
Native American women are frequently sexually objectified and are often stereotyped as being promiscuous. Such misconceptions lead to murder, rape and violence against Native American women and girls by non-Native men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Killing the Indian Maiden: Images of Native American Women in Film|author=M. Marubbio|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M46Orra4exoC&amp;pg=PA231&amp;lpg=PA231&amp;dq=rape+and+stereotypes+of+native+american+women&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=GkuklPp8FT&amp;sig=-iVNZxzNae-xUFu5lEw02DFmU20&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=vNfOUof_KvOmsQTsj4GADA&amp;ved=0CFYQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=rape%20and%20stereotypes%20of%20native%20american%20women&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An [[Algonquian languages|Algonquin]] word, the term "squaw" is now widely deemed offensive due to its use for hundreds of years in a derogatory context. However, there remains more than a thousand locations in the U.S. that incorporate the term in its name.&lt;ref name="NMAI"/&gt;

===Substance abuse===
{{main|Native Americans and reservation inequality#Substance abuse}}
Because of the high frequency of [[American Indian alcoholism]], a [[stereotype]] has been applied to all American Indians. As with most groups, the incidence of substance abuse is related to issues of poverty and mental distress, both of which may be, in part, the result of racial stereotyping and discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/arh22-4/253.pdf|title=American Indians and Alcohol|author=Fred Beauvais, Ph.D.|journal=Alcohol Health &amp; Research World|year=1998|volume=22|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Treatment for substance abuse by Native Americans is more effective when it is community-based, and addresses the issues of cultural identification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Preventing Substance Abuse in American Indian and Alaska Native Youth:Promising Strategies for Healthier Communities|author1=Elizabeth H.

==Inuit stereotypes==
{{refimprove section|date=January 2013}}
[[Inuit]], often referred to as [[Eskimo]]s (which many see as derogatory), are usually depicted dressed in [[parka]]s, paddling kayaks, which the Inuit people invented, carving out trinkets, living in [[igloo]]s, going fishing with a [[harpoon]], [[whaling|hunting whales]], traveling by [[sleigh]] and [[husky|huskies]], eating [[cod-liver oil]] and the men are called [[Nanook]] in reference to the documentary ''[[Nanook of the North]]''. Eskimo children may have a [[Pinniped|seal]] for a best friend.

Eskimos are sometimes shown rubbing noses together in greeting ritual, referred to as [[Eskimo kissing]] or preferably "Inuit kissing" in Western culture, and only loosely based on an authentic Inuit practice known as ''kunik''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.southcoasttoday.com/article/20050216/life/302169966|title=An 'Eskimo kiss' is a kunik, and maybe not what you think|work=southcoasttoday.com|access-date=2018-10-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are also often depicted surrounded by [[polar bear]]s, [[walrus]]es and inaccurately, with [[penguin]]s, which do not live in the [[Arctic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://scholar.colorado.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://www.google.com/&amp;httpsredir=1&amp;article=1796&amp;context=honr_theses|title=Fourth World Film: Politics of Indigenous Representation in Mainstream and Indigenous Cinema|last=Herrington|first=Laura|date=October 3, 2018|website=University of Colorado Boulder|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effect of stereotyping==
Stereotypes harm both the victims and those that perpetuate them, with effects of the society at large. Victims suffer the emotional distress; anger, frustration, insecurity, and feelings of hopelessness. Most of all, Indian children exposed at an early age to these mainstream images internalize the stereotypes paired with the images, resulting in lower self-esteem, contributing to all of the other problems faced by Native Americans. Stereotypes become discrimination when the assumptions of being more prone to violence and alcoholism limit job opportunities. This leads directly to Indians being viewed less stable economically, making it more difficult for those that have succeeded to fully enjoy the benefits in the same way that non-Indians do, such as obtaining credit. For those that maintain them, stereotypes prevent a more accurate view of Indians and the history of the United States.&lt;ref name="mihesuah"/&gt;

Research also demonstrates the harm done to society by stereotyping of any kind. Two studies examined the effect of exposure to an American Indian sports mascot on the tendency to endorse stereotypes of a different minority group. A study was first done at the University of Illinois, and then replicated at The College of New Jersey with the same results. Students were given a paragraph to read about Chief Illiniwek adapted from the University of Illinois' official website; while the control group was given a description of an arts center. In both studies the students exposed to the sports mascot were more likely to express stereotypical views of Asian-Americans. Although Chief Illiniwek was described only in terms of positive characteristics (as a respectful symbol, not a mascot), the stereotyping of Asian-Americans included negative characteristics, such as being "socially inept". This was indicative of a spreading effect; exposure to any stereotypes increased the likelihood of stereotypical thinking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kim-Prieto|first=Chu|title=Effect of Exposure to an American Indian Mascot on the Tendency to Stereotype a Different Minority Group|journal=Journal of Applied Social Psychology|date=March 2010|volume=40|number=3|page=534|doi=10.1111/j.1559-1816.2010.00586.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-hidden-brain/201003/native-american-imagery-sports-mascots-new-problem|work=Psychology Today|title=Native American imagery as sports mascots: A new problem|date=March 25, 2010|first=Shankar|last=Vedantam|accessdate=February 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Alabama, at a game between the [[Pinson Valley High School]] "Indians" and [[McAdory High School]], the latter team displayed a banner using a disparaging reference to the [[Trail of Tears]] for which the principal of the school apologized to Native Americans, stated that the cheerleader squad responsible would be disciplined, and that all students would be given a lesson on the actual history of the Trail of Tears. Native Americans responded that it was an example of the continuing insensitivity and stereotyping of Indians in America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://usnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/11/18/21523300-alabama-principal-apologizes-for-trail-of-tears-banner-at-high-school-football-game|title=Alabama principal apologizes for 'Trail of Tears' banner at high school football game|author=Simon Moya-Smith|publisher=NBC News|date=2013-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.upi.com/Odd_News/Blog/2013/11/19/McAdory-High-School-in-Alabama-apologizes-for-Trail-of-Tears-sign/5471384871891/|title=McAdory High School in Alabama apologizes for 'Trail of Tears' sign|author=Evan Bleier|date=November 19, 2013|publisher=UPI}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar sign was displayed in Tennessee by the [[Dyersburg, Tennessee|Dyersburg]] Trojans when they played the [[North Side High School (Jackson, Tennessee)|Jackson Northside Indians]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.motherjones.com/mojo/2013/11/heres-another-high-school-football-team-promoting-trail-tears|title=Here's Another High School Football Team Promoting the "Trail of Tears"|author=Tim Murphy|date=November 21, 2013|publisher=Mother Jones}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern perpetuation of stereotypes===
The mainstream media makes a lot of money making movies that play along with stereotypes; while accurate portrayals may be critically acclaimed they are not often made or widely distributed.&lt;ref name="mihesuah"/&gt;

===Overcoming stereotypes===
In the 1980s and 1990s, the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] (CBC) made efforts to improve the portrayals of Aboriginal people in its television dramas. ''[[Spirit Bay]]'', ''[[The Beachcombers]]'', ''[[North of 60]]'' and ''[[The Rez]]'' used Native actors to portray their own people, living real lives and earning believable livelihoods in identifiable parts of the country.

''[[Imagining Indians]]'' is a 1992 documentary film produced and directed by Native American filmmaker, Victor Masayesva, Jr. (Hopi). The documentary attempts to reveal the misrepresentation of Indigenous Native American culture and tradition in Classical Hollywood films by interviews with different Indigenous Native American actors and extras from various tribes throughout the United States.

===21st century===
[[Reel Injun]] is a 2009 Canadian documentary film directed by Cree filmmaker Neil Diamond, Catherine Bainbridge, and Jeremiah Hayes that explores the portrayal of Native Americans in film. Reel Injun is illustrated with excerpts from classic and contemporary portrayals of Native people in Hollywood movies and interviews with filmmakers, actors and film historians, while director Diamond travels across the United States to visit iconic locations in motion picture as well as American Indian history.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.pbs.org/independentlens/films/reel-injun/|title=Reel Injun {{!}} Native Americans Portrayal in Hollywood {{!}} Independent Lens {{!}} PBS|work=Independent Lens|access-date=2018-10-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reel Injun explores many stereotypes about Natives in film, from the Noble savage to the Drunken Indian. It profiles such figures as Iron Eyes Cody, an Italian American who reinvented himself as a Native American on screen. The film also explores Hollywood's practice of using Italian Americans and American Jews to portray Indians in the movies and reveals how some Native American actors made jokes in their native tongue on screen when the director thought they were simply speaking gibberish.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

''[[Inventing the Indian]]'' is a 2012 BBC documentary first broadcast on 28 October on BBC 4 exploring the stereotypical view of Native Americans in the United States in cinema and literature.

'''''The Climate Monologues''''' is an episodic one-woman play, created and performed by Sharon Abreu. Inspired by [[The Vagina Monologues]], ''The Climate Monologues'' consists of a series of monologues and original songs from the point of view of people affected by and working to prevent [[climate change]].

The play premiered at the Orcas Island Grange in [[Eastsound, WA]], on May 16, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://orcasissues.com/climate-monologues-free-premiere-on-orcas//|title=Climate Monologues Free Premiere on Orcas|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 11, 2011, Abreu received The Spirit of Nature, Ecology and Society Environmental Justice Award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://opencuny.org/nature/psc-ej-awards/|title=PSC CUNY Environmental Justice Awards|date=17 February 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; at ''The Culture of Climate Change'' colloquium&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://opencuny.org/nature/|title=Nature, Ecology &amp; Society Network|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[City University of New York]] (CUNY) Graduate Center in New York City, for her presentation of ''The Climate Monologues''.

Abreu performed an updated version of the show on March 27, 2016, in the Los Angeles Women's Theatre Festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.laprogressive.com/the-climate-monologues/|title=Changing the Course of Climate Change with Song|date=9 March 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She listens to the stories of [[West Virginia]]n [[coal mining]] families, NW activists, Tribal leaders, Mississippi teachers, a Colorado [[cowgirl]] and Orcas’ own Lea Bossler and tells them back to us in compelling, non-scientific language about the world we live in."

Theater reviewer Lexi Orphanos wrote, "Abreu’s monologues bring a humanity to the statistics that plaster our newspapers and Facebook feeds. She doesn’t just give you the facts, she gives you a human life, bent and reshaped by environmental abuse."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theasy.com/Reviews/2016/C/theclimatemonologues.php/|title=The Climate Monologues|publisher=Theatre Is Easy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The play was featured in chapter 6, ''Orcas Island's Irthlingz: Community Art as Activism'' in the 2016 book, ''A Song to Save the Salish Sea: Musical Performance as Environmental Activism'', by Mark Pedelty, published by Indiana University Press.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iupress.indiana.edu/product_info.php?products_id=808133|title=A Song to Save the Salish Sea|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plot/Structure ==

''The Climate Monologues'' is made up of a varying number of monologues in the voices of real people affected by or working to address [[climate change]].  Each of the monologues deals with a topic related to [[climate change]], such as health and [[mountaintop removal mining]], [[alternative energy]], [[rail freight transport]] of coal and oil, and citizen [[activism]]. A recurring theme is the individual citizen taking successful action to address issues related to climate change and energy.

New monologues have been added over the years to highlight emerging issues relating to climate change. The number and order of the monologues has been varied to accommodate time limitations and dramatic considerations.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5420">'''Transferable development rights''' (TDR) is a method for controlling land use to complement [[land-use planning]] and [[zoning]] for more effective urban growth management and land conservation. The TDR process can be considered a tool for controlling [[urban sprawl]] by concentrating development. TDR is a legal mechanism offered in some local government jurisdictions as a form of [[land development|development]] control. The procedure offers landowners financial incentives or bonuses for the conservation and maintenance of the environmental, heritage or agricultural values of their land. TDR is based on the concept that with land ownership comes the right of use of land, or [[land development]]. These land-based development rights can in some jurisdictions be used, unused, sold, or otherwise transferred by the owner of a parcel.&lt;ref name="Handbook"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Nelson |first1=Arthur C. |last2=Pruetz |first2=Rick |last3=Woodruff |first3=Doug |year=2011 |title=The TDR Handbook: Designing and Implementing Transfer of Development Rights Programs |location=Washington, D.C. |publisher=Island Press |isbn=9781610911597}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|3}} &lt;ref name="Farmland Trust"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.farmland.org//programs/states/wa/documents/APPENDIXH-Transferofdevelopmentrights.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110116082248/http://www.farmland.org//programs/states/wa/documents/APPENDIXH-Transferofdevelopmentrights.pdf |title=Transfer of Development Rights; Fact Sheet |date=April 2008 |archive-date=2011-01-16 |publisher=American Farmland Trust |location=Washington, D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Developers can purchase the development rights of certain parcels within a designated "sending district" and transfer the rights to another "receiving district" to increase the density of their new development. Alternatively, parcels with buildings that do not use all of their available size have "excess" developable capacity that can be conveyed to other parcels, possibly adjoining the first parcels.  A widely-noted example of districted TDRs is the [[Montgomery County, Maryland Agricultural Reserve]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://montgomeryplanning.org/planning/agricultural-reserve/ |title=Agricultural Reserve |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2018-02-23 |publisher=Montgomery County Planning Department |location=Silver Spring, Maryland}}&lt;/ref&gt; TDR programs have been implemented in over 200 U.S. communities,&lt;ref name="Handbook"/&gt;{{rp|25}} in several states, including [[Colorado]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bouldercounty.org/property-and-land/land-use/planning/transferable-development-rights-tdr/ |title=Transferable Development Rights Program |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website=Property &amp; Land |publisher=Boulder County, Colorado |access-date=2018-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Massachusetts]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.mass.gov/service-details/case-studies-transfer-of-development-rights-tdr |title=Case Studies — Transfer of Development Rights |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website=Energy and Environmental Affairs |publisher=Commonwealth of Massachusetts |access-date=2018-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Virginia]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Lloyd, Jr. |first=T.

TDR credit banks can be used to store development rights that have been purchased if there is not yet a receiving area development identified. This mechanism is used when the time of the sale in the sending area is not concurrent with a development in the receiving area. It is also useful in communities that have the opportunity to purchase the rights from an area of high conservation interest but do not have a development that can receive higher density at the time. TDR credit banks should be operated by a third party organization that is empowered to negotiate the sale of development rights such as a non-profit organization or an agency operating within the community.&lt;ref&gt;Massachusetts Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs, [http://www.mass.gov/envir/smart_growth_toolkit/bylaws/TDR-Bylaw.pdf "Transfer of Development Rights"] Massachusetts Smart Growth/Smart Energy Toolkit Bylaw, 2005.
