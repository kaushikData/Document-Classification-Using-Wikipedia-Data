'''53''' ('''fifty-three''') is the [[natural number]] following [[52 (number)|52]] and preceding [[54 (number)|54]]. It is the 16th [[prime number]].

==In mathematics==
*'''Fifty-three''' is the [[16 (number)|16]]th [[prime number]]. It is also an [[Eisenstein prime]], and a [[Sophie Germain prime]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite OEIS|1=A005384|2=Sophie Germain primes|accessdate=2016-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The sum of the first 53 primes is 5830, which is divisible by 53, a property shared by few other numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite OEIS|1=A045345|2=Numbers n such that n divides sum of first n primes A007504(n). }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.primepuzzles.net/puzzles/puzz_031.htm Puzzle 31.- The Average Prime number, APN(k) = S(Pk)/k] from The Prime Puzzles &amp; Problems Connection website&lt;/ref&gt;
*53 written in [[hexadecimal]] is 35, that is, the same characters used in the [[decimal representation]], but reversed. Four additional multiples of 53 share this property: 371 = {{hexadecimal|371}}, 5141 = {{hexadecimal|5141}}, 99481 = {{hexadecimal|99481}}, and 8520280 = 0{{hexadecimal|8520280}}.  Apart from the trivial case of single-digit decimals, no other number has this property.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1327887/decimal-hex-palindromes-why-multiples-of-53 |title=elementary number theory - Decimal/hex palindromes: why multiples of 53?|date=June 16, 2015|website=Mathematics Stack Exchange|access-date=29 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*53 cannot be expressed as the sum of any integer and its base-10 digits, making 53 a [[self number]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite OEIS|1=A003052|2=Self numbers|accessdate=2016-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5234">In mathematical physics, the '''ADHM construction''' or '''monad construction''' is the construction of all [[instanton]]s using methods of linear algebra by [[Michael Atiyah]], [[Vladimir Drinfeld]], [[Nigel Hitchin]], [[Yuri I. Manin]] in their paper "Construction of Instantons."

== ADHM data ==
The ADHM construction uses the following data:

* complex [[vector space]]s ''V'' and ''W'' of dimension ''k'' and ''N'',
* ''k''&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;''k'' complex matrices ''B''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''B''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, a ''k''&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;''N'' complex matrix ''I'' and a ''N''&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;''k'' complex matrix&amp;nbsp;''J'',
* a [[real number|real]] [[moment map]] &lt;math&gt;\mu_r = [B_1,B_1^\dagger]+[B_2,B_2^\dagger]+II^\dagger-J^\dagger J,&lt;/math&gt;
* a [[complex number|complex]] moment map &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\mu_c = [B_1,B_2]+IJ.&lt;/math&gt;

Then the ADHM construction claims that, given certain regularity conditions,
* Given ''B''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''B''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''I'', ''J'' such that &lt;math&gt;\mu_r=\mu_c=0&lt;/math&gt;, an anti-self-dual [[instanton]] in a [[special unitary group|SU(''N'')]] [[gauge theory]] with instanton number ''k'' can be constructed,
* All anti-self-dual [[instantons]] can be obtained in this way and are in one-to-one correspondence with solutions up to a U(''k'') rotation which acts on each ''B'' in the [[adjoint representation]] and on ''I'' and ''J'' via the [[fundamental representation|fundamental]] and antifundamental representations
* The [[metric (mathematics)|metric]] on the [[moduli space]] of instantons is that inherited from the flat metric on ''B'',  ''I'' and ''J''.

==Generalizations==

===Noncommutative instantons===
In a [[noncommutative geometry|noncommutative]] gauge theory, the ADHM construction is identical but the moment map &lt;math&gt;\vec\mu &lt;/math&gt;  is set equal to the self-dual projection of the noncommutativity matrix of the spacetime times the [[identity matrix]].  In this case instantons exist even when the gauge group is U(1). The noncommutative instantons were discovered by  [[Nikita Nekrasov]] and [[Albert Schwarz]] in 1998.

===Vortices===
Setting ''B''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and ''J'' to zero, one obtains the classical moduli space of nonabelian [[Abrikosov vortex|vortices]] in a [[supersymmetry|supersymmetric]] gauge theory with an equal number of colors and flavors, as was demonstrated in [http://inspirehep.net/record/621372  Vortices, instantons and branes].  The generalization to greater numbers of flavors appeared in [http://inspirehep.net/record/710805  Solitons in the Higgs phase: The Moduli matrix approach].  In both cases the [[Fayet-Iliopoulos term]], which determines a [[squark]] [[top quark condensate|condensate]], plays the role of the noncommutativity parameter in the real moment map.

== The construction formula ==
Let ''x'' be the 4-dimensional [[Euclidean space|Euclidean]] [[spacetime]] coordinates written in [[quaternion]]ic notation
&lt;math&gt;x_{ij}=\begin{pmatrix}z_2&amp;z_1\\-\bar{z_1}&amp;\bar{z_2}\end{pmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;

Consider the 2''k''&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;(''N''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;2''k'') matrix

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta= \begin{pmatrix}I&amp;B_2+z_2&amp;B_1+z_1\\J^\dagger&amp;-B_1^\dagger-\bar{z_1}&amp;B_2^\dagger+\bar{z_2}\end{pmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;

Then the conditions &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\mu_r=\mu_c=0&lt;/math&gt; are equivalent to the factorization condition 
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta\Delta^\dagger=\begin{pmatrix}f^{-1}&amp;0\\0&amp;f^{-1}\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt; where ''f''(''x'') is a ''k'' &amp;times; ''k'' [[Hermitian matrix]].

Then a hermitian [[projection (linear algebra)|projection]] operator ''P'' can be constructed as 
:&lt;math&gt;P=\Delta^\dagger\begin{pmatrix}f&amp;0\\0&amp;f\end{pmatrix}\Delta.&lt;/math&gt;

The [[nullspace]] of Δ(''x'') is of dimension ''N'' for generic ''x''. The basis vectors for this null-space can be assembled into an (''N''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;2''k'')&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;''N'' matrix ''U''(''x'') with orthonormalization condition ''U''&lt;sup&gt;†&lt;/sup&gt;''U''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1.

A regularity condition on the rank of Δ guarantees the completeness condition 
:&lt;math&gt;P+UU^\dagger=1. \, &lt;/math&gt;

The anti-selfdual [[connection (mathematics)|connection]] is then constructed from ''U'' by the formula 
:&lt;math&gt;A_m=U^\dagger \partial_m U.&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4713">[[Image:Amalgamation property.svg|thumb|200px|alt=Amalgamation Property commutative diagram|A [[commutative diagram]] of the amalgamation property.]]
In the mathematical field of [[model theory]], the '''amalgamation property''' is a property of collections of [[structure (mathematical logic)|structures]] that guarantees, under certain conditions, that two structures in the collection can be regarded as substructures of a larger one.

This property plays a crucial role in [[Fraïssé's theorem]], which characterises classes of finite structures that arise as
[[Age_(model_theory)|age]]s of countable homogeneous structures.

The [[diagram (category theory)|diagram]] of the amalgamation property appears in many areas of [[mathematical logic]]. Examples include in [[modal logic]] as an incestual accessibility relation, and in [[lambda calculus]] as a manner of [[Lambda calculus#Reduction|reduction]] having the [[Church–Rosser property]].

==Definition==
An ''amalgam'' can be formally defined as a 5-tuple (''A,f,B,g,C'') such that ''A,B,C'' are structures having the same [[signature (logic) |signature]], and ''f:&amp;nbsp;A''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;''B, g'':&amp;nbsp;''A''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;''C'' are injective morphisms that are referred to as ''embeddings''.

A class ''K'' of structures has the amalgamation property if for every amalgam with ''A,B,C''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''K'' and ''A''&amp;nbsp;≠&amp;nbsp;Ø, there exist both a structure ''D''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''K'' and embeddings ''f':''&amp;nbsp;''B''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;''D, g':''&amp;nbsp;''C''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;''D'' such that

:&lt;math&gt;f'\circ f = g' \circ g. \, &lt;/math&gt;

==Examples==
* The class of sets, where the embeddings are injective functions, and if they are assumed to be inclusions then an amalgam is simply the union of the two sets.
* The class of [[free group]]s where the embeddings are injective homomorphisms, and (assuming they are inclusions) an amalgam is the [[quotient group]] &lt;math&gt;B*C/A&lt;/math&gt;, where * is the [[free product]].
* The class of finite [[linear order]]ings.

A similar but different notion to the amalgamation property is the [[joint embedding property]]. To see the difference, first consider the class ''K'' (or simply the set) containing three models with linear orders, ''L''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; of size one, ''L''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; of size two, and ''L''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; of size three. This class ''K'' has the joint embedding property because all three models can be embedded into ''L''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. However, ''K'' does not have the amalgamation property. The counterexample for this starts with ''L''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; containing a single element ''e'' and extends in two different ways to ''L''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, one in which ''e'' is the smallest and the other in which ''e'' is the largest. Now any common model with an embedding from these two extensions must be at least of size five so that there are two elements on either side of ''e''.

Now consider the class of [[algebraically closed field]]s. This class has the amalgamation property since any two field extensions of a prime field can be embedded into a common field. However, two arbitrary fields cannot be embedded into a common field when the [[Characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]] of the fields differ.

==Strong amalgamation property==

A class ''K'' of structures has the ''strong amalgamation property'' (SAP), also called the ''disjoint amalgamation property'' (DAP), if for every amalgam with ''A,B,C'' ∈ ''K'' there exist both a structure ''D'' ∈ ''K'' and embeddings ''f&lt;nowiki&gt;':&lt;/nowiki&gt;'' ''B''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;''D, g': C''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;''D'' such that

:&lt;math&gt;f' \circ f = g' \circ g \, &lt;/math&gt;

::and

:&lt;math&gt;f '[B] \cap g '[C] = (f ' \circ f)[A] = (g ' \circ g)[A] \, &lt;/math&gt;

::where for any set ''X'' and function ''h'' on ''X,''

:&lt;math&gt;h \lbrack X \rbrack = \lbrace h(x) \mid x \in X \rbrace. \, &lt;/math&gt;

The '''auxiliary particle filter''' is a [[particle filter]]ing algorithm introduced by Pitt and Shephard in 1999 to improve some deficiencies of the [[particle filter#Sequential importance resampling .28SIR.29|sequential importance resampling]] (SIR) algorithm when dealing with tailed observation densities.

Assume that the filtered [[Posterior probability|posterior]] is described by the following ''M'' weighted samples:

: &lt;math&gt;
p(x_t|z_{1:t}) \approx \sum_{i=1}^M \omega^{(i)}_t \delta \left( x_t - x^{(i)}_t \right).
&lt;/math&gt;

Then, each step in the [[algorithm]] consists of first drawing a sample of the particle index &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; which will be propagated from &lt;math&gt;t-1&lt;/math&gt; into the new step &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;. These indexes are auxiliary [[variable (mathematics)|variables]] only used as an intermediary step, hence the name of the algorithm. The indexes are drawn according to the likelihood of some reference point &lt;math&gt;\mu^{(i)}_t&lt;/math&gt; which in some way is related to the transition model &lt;math&gt;x_t|x_{t-1}&lt;/math&gt; (for example, the mean, a sample, etc.):

: &lt;math&gt;
k^{(i)} \sim P(i=k|z_t) \propto \omega^{(i)}_t p( z_t | \mu^{(i)}_t )
&lt;/math&gt;

This is repeated for &lt;math&gt;i=1,2,\dots,M&lt;/math&gt;, and using these indexes we can now draw the conditional samples:

: &lt;math&gt;
x_t^{(i)} \sim p( x | x^{k^{(i)}}_{t-1}).
&lt;/math&gt;

Finally, the weights are updated to account for the mismatch between the likelihood at the actual sample and the predicted point &lt;math&gt;\mu_t^{k^{(i)}}&lt;/math&gt;:

: &lt;math&gt;
\omega_t^{(i)} \propto \frac{p( z_t | x^{(i)}_t) } { p( z_t | \mu^{k^{(i)}}_t) }.
&lt;/math&gt;

In mathematics, the '''bracket ring''' is the [[subring]] of the ring of [[polynomial]]s ''k''[''x''&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''x''&lt;sub&gt;''dn''&lt;/sub&gt;] generated by the ''d'' by ''d'' [[Minor (linear algebra)|minors]] of a [[generic matrix|generic]] ''d'' by ''n'' [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] (''x''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt;).

The bracket ring may be regarded as the ring of polynomials on the image of a [[Grassmannian]] under the [[Plücker embedding]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last1=Björner | first1=Anders | last2=Las Vergnas | author2-link=Michel Las Vergnas | first2=Michel | last3=Sturmfels | first3=Bernd | author3-link=Bernd Sturmfels | last4=White | first4=Neil | last5=Ziegler | first5=Günter | title=Oriented matroids | edition=2nd | series=Encyclopedia of Mathematics and Its Applications | volume=46 | publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] | year=1999 | isbn=0-521-77750-X | zbl=0944.52006 | page=79 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For given ''d'' ≤ ''n'' we define as formal variables the ''brackets'' [λ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; λ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ... λ&lt;sub&gt;''d''&lt;/sub&gt;] with the λ taken from {1,...,''n''}, subject to [λ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; λ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ... λ&lt;sub&gt;''d''&lt;/sub&gt;] = − [λ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; λ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ... λ&lt;sub&gt;''d''&lt;/sub&gt;] and similarly for other transpositions.  The set Λ(''n'',''d'') of size &lt;math&gt;\binom{n}{d}&lt;/math&gt; generates a polynomial ring ''K''[Λ(''n'',''d'')] over a field ''K''.  There is a homomorphism Φ(''n'',''d'') from ''K''[Λ(''n'',''d'')] to the polynomial ring ''K''[''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i'',''j''&lt;/sub&gt;] in ''nd'' indeterminates given by mapping 
[λ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; λ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ... λ&lt;sub&gt;''d''&lt;/sub&gt;] to the determinant of the ''d'' by ''d'' matrix consisting of the columns of the ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i'',''j''&lt;/sub&gt; indexed by the λ.  The ''bracket ring'' ''B''(''n'',''d'') is the image of Φ.  The kernel ''I''(''n'',''d'') of Φ encodes the relations or ''syzygies'' that exist between the minors of a generic ''n'' by ''d'' matrix.  The projective variety defined by the ideal ''I'' is the (''n''−''d'')''d'' dimensional Grassmann variety whose points correspond to ''d''-dimensional subspaces of an ''n''-dimensional space.&lt;ref&gt;Sturmfels (2008) pp.78–79&lt;/ref&gt;

To compute with brackets it is necessary to determine when an expression lies in the ideal ''I''(''n'',''d'').  This is achieved by a ''straightening law'' due to Young (1928).&lt;ref&gt;Sturmfels (2008) p.80&lt;/ref&gt;

*Adding the decimal digits of a [[integer#Order-theoretic properties|positive whole number]], while optionally ignoring any 9s or digits which sum to a multiple of 9. The result of this procedure is a number which is smaller than the original whenever the original has more than one digit, leaves the same remainder as the original after division by nine, and may be obtained from the original by subtracting a multiple of 9 from it.   The name of the procedure derives from this latter property.
*Repeated application of this procedure to the results obtained from previous applications until a single-digit number is obtained.  This single-digit number is called the "[[digital root]]" of the original.  If a number is divisible by 9, its digital root is 9.   Otherwise, its digital root is the remainder it leaves after being divided by 9.
*A  [[sanity test]] in which  the above-mentioned procedures are used to check for errors in arithmetical calculations.  The test is carried out by applying the same sequence of arithmetical operations to the digital roots of the operands as are applied to the operands themselves.  If no mistakes are made in the calculations, the digital roots of the two resultants should be the same.  If they are different, therefore, one or more mistakes must have been made in the calculations.

==Digit sums==
{{Main|Digit sum}}

To "cast out nines" from a single number, its decimal digits can be simply added together to obtain its so-called [[digit sum]].   The digit sum of 2946, for example is 2 + 9 + 4 + 6 = 21.   Since 21 = 2946 − 325 × 9, the effect of taking the digit sum of 2946 is to "cast out" 325 lots of 9 from it.  If the digit 9 is ignored when  summing the digits, the effect is to "cast out" one more 9 to give the result 12.

More generally, when casting out nines by summing digits, any set of digits which add up to 9, or a multiple of 9, can be ignored.  In the number 3264, for example, the digits 3 and 6 sum to 9.  Ignoring these two digits, therefore, and summing the other two, we get 2 + 4 = 6.  Since 6 = 3264 − 362 × 9, this computation has resulted in casting out 362 lots of 9 from 3264.

For an arbitrary number, &lt;math&gt;10^n d_n + 10^{n-1} d_{n-1} + \cdots + d_0&lt;/math&gt;, normally represented by the sequence of decimal digits, &lt;math&gt;d_nd_{n-1} \dots d_0&lt;/math&gt;, the digit sum is &lt;math&gt;d_n + d_{n-1} + \cdots + d_0&lt;/math&gt;.  The difference between the original number and its digit sum is 

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
&amp; 10^n d_n + 10^{n-1} d_{n-1} + \cdots + d_0 - \left(d_n + d_{n-1} + \cdots + d_0\right) \\
= {} &amp; \left(10^n-1\right)d_n +  \left(10^{n-1}-1\right)d_{n-1} + \cdots + 9 d_1.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Because numbers of the form &lt;math&gt;10^i -1&lt;/math&gt; are always divisible by 9 (since &lt;math&gt;10^i -1 = 9\times\left(10^{i-1} + 10^{i-2} + \cdots + 1\right)&lt;/math&gt;), replacing the original number by its digit sum has the effect of casting out 

: &lt;math&gt;
\frac{10^n -1}{9}d_n + \frac{10^{n -1}-1}{9}d_{n-1} + \cdots + d_1
&lt;/math&gt;

lots of 9.

==Digital roots==
{{Main|Digital root}}
If the procedure described in the preceding paragraph is repeatedly applied to the result of each previous application, the eventual result will be a single-digit number from which ''all'' 9s, with the possible exception of one, have been "cast out".  The resulting single-digit number is called the ''digital root'' of the original. The exception occurs when the original number has a digital root of 9, whose digit sum is itself, and therefore will not be cast out by taking further digit sums.

The number 12565, for instance, has digit sum 1+2+5+6+5 = 19, which, in turn, has digit sum 1+9=10, which, in its turn has digit sum 1+0=1, a single-digit number.  The digital root of 12565 is therefore 1, and its computation has the effect of casting out (12565 - 1)/9 = 1396 lots of 9 from 12565.

==Checking calculations by casting out nines==

To check the result of an arithmetical calculation by casting out nines, each number in the calculation is replaced by its digital root and the same calculations applied to these digital roots.  The digital root of the result of this calculation is then compared with that of the result of the original calculation.  If no mistake has been made in the calculations, these two digital roots must be the same. Examples in which casting-out-nines has been used to check [[addition]], [[subtraction]], [[multiplication]], and [[Division (mathematics)|division]] are given below.

==Examples==
===Addition===
In each [[addend]], cross out all 9s and pairs of digits that total 9, then add together what remains. These new values are called ''excesses''. Add up leftover digits for each addend until one digit is reached. Now process the [[summation|sum]] and also the excesses to get a ''final'' excess.
{|
|-
|align="right"| &lt;math&gt;\bcancel{3}\ \ 2\ \bcancel{6}\ 4\ &lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; 
|&lt;math&gt;\bcancel{6}&lt;/math&gt;
|2 and 4 add up to 6.
|-
|align="right"| &lt;math&gt;\bcancel{8} \bcancel{4} \bcancel{1} \bcancel{5}&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;\ 0&lt;/math&gt;
|8+1=9 and 4+5=9; there are no digits left.
|-
|align="right"| &lt;math&gt;2\ \bcancel{9}\ 4\ \ 6\ &lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;\bcancel{3}&lt;/math&gt;
|2, 4, and 6 make 12; 1 and 2 make 3.
|-
|align="right"| &lt;math&gt;\underline{+\bcancel{3}\ 2\ \ 0\ \bcancel{6}}&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;\ 2&lt;/math&gt;
|2 and 0 are 2.
|-
|align="right"| &lt;math&gt;\bcancel{1}\ 7\ \bcancel{8}\ 3\ \ 1\ &lt;/math&gt;
|
|rowspan="2"| &lt;math&gt;\bigg\Downarrow&lt;/math&gt;
|7, 3, and 1 make 11; 1 and 1 add up to 2.
|-
|align="center"|&lt;math&gt;\Downarrow&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|align="center"|&lt;math&gt;{2}&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;\Leftrightarrow&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;2&lt;/math&gt; 
|The excess from the sum should equal the final excess from the addends.
|}

===Subtraction===
{|
|-
|align="right"| &lt;math&gt;\bcancel{5}\bcancel{6}\bcancel{4}\bcancel{3}&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; 
|&lt;math&gt;0(9)&lt;/math&gt;
|First, cross out all 9s and digits that total 9 in both [[minuend]] and [[subtrahend]] (italicized).
|-
|align="right"| &lt;math&gt;\underline{-\ 2\ \bcancel{8}\bcancel{9}\bcancel{1}}&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;-2&lt;/math&gt;
|Add up leftover digits for each value until one digit is reached.
|-
|align="right"| &lt;math&gt;\bcancel{2}\ 7\ \bcancel{5}\bcancel{2}&lt;/math&gt;
|
|rowspan="2"| &lt;math&gt;\bigg\Downarrow&lt;/math&gt;
|Now follow the same procedure with the difference, coming to a single digit.
|-
|align="center"|&lt;math&gt;\Downarrow&lt;/math&gt;
|
|Because subtracting 2 from zero gives a negative number, borrow a 9 from the minuend.
|-
|align="center"|&lt;math&gt;{7}&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;\Leftrightarrow&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;7&lt;/math&gt; 
|The difference between the minuend and the subtrahend excesses should equal the difference excess.
|}

===Multiplication===
{|
|-
|align="right"| &lt;math&gt;\bcancel{5} \bcancel{4}\ 8\ &lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; 
|&lt;math&gt;8&lt;/math&gt;
|First, cross out all 9s and digits that total 9 in each [[Coefficient|factor]] (italicized).
|-
|align="right"| &lt;math&gt;\underline{\ \ \ \ \ \ \times\ 6\ \ 2\ \bcancel{9}}&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;8&lt;/math&gt;
|Add up leftover digits for each multiplicand until one digit is reached.
|-
|align="right"| &lt;math&gt;{\bcancel{3}\ 4\ \ 4\ \bcancel{6}\bcancel{9}\ 2\ }&lt;/math&gt;
|
|rowspan="2"| &lt;math&gt;\bigg\Downarrow&lt;/math&gt;
|Multiply the two excesses, and then add until one digit is reached.
|-
|align="center"|&lt;math&gt;\Downarrow&lt;/math&gt;
|
|Do the same with the [[Product (mathematics)|product]], crossing out 9s and getting one digit.
|-
|align="center"|&lt;math&gt;{1}&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;\Leftrightarrow&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;
|The excess from the product should equal the final excess from the factors.
|}

&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;8 times 8 is 64; 6 and 4 are 10; 1 and 0 are 1.

===Division===
{|
|-
|align="center"|&lt;math&gt;\bcancel{27}\bcancel{54}62&lt;/math&gt;
|align="center"|&lt;math&gt;\div&lt;/math&gt;
|align="center"|&lt;math&gt;877&lt;/math&gt;
|align="center"|&lt;math&gt;=&lt;/math&gt;
|align="center"|&lt;math&gt;314&lt;/math&gt;
|align="center"|&lt;math&gt;r.&lt;/math&gt;
|align="center"|&lt;math&gt;84&lt;/math&gt;
|Cross out all 9s and digits that total 9 in the [[divisor]], [[quotient]], and [[remainder]].
|-
|align="center"|&lt;math&gt;\Downarrow&lt;/math&gt;
||
|align="center"|&lt;math&gt;\Downarrow&lt;/math&gt;
||
|align="center"|&lt;math&gt;\Downarrow&lt;/math&gt;
||
|align="center"|&lt;math&gt;\Downarrow&lt;/math&gt;
|Add up all uncrossed digits from each value until one digit is reached for each value.
|-
|align="center"|&lt;math&gt;8&lt;/math&gt;
|align="center"|&lt;math&gt;\Leftrightarrow&lt;/math&gt;
|align="center"|&lt;math&gt;(4&lt;/math&gt;
|align="center"|&lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt; 
|align="center"|&lt;math&gt;8)&lt;/math&gt;
|align="center"|&lt;math&gt;+&lt;/math&gt;
|align="center"|&lt;math&gt;3&lt;/math&gt;
|The dividend excess should equal the final excess from the other values. 
In other words, you are performing the same procedure as in a multiplication, only backwards. 8x4=32 which is 5, 5+3 = 8. And 8=8.
|}

==How it works==

The method works because the original numbers are 'decimal' (base 10), the modulus is chosen to differ by 1, and casting out is equivalent to taking a [[digit sum]]. In general any two 'large' integers, ''x'' and ''y'', expressed in any smaller ''modulus'' as ''x''' and ''y' '' (for example,  modulo 7) will always have the same sum, difference or product as their originals. This property is also preserved for the 'digit sum' where the base and the modulus differ by 1.

If a calculation was correct before casting out, casting out on both sides will preserve correctness. However, it is possible that two previously unequal integers will be identical modulo 9 (on average, a ninth of the time).

The operation does not work on fractions, since a given fractional number does not have a unique representation.

== A variation on the explanation ==

A nice trick for very young children to learn to add nine is to add ten to the digit and to count back one.  Since we are adding 1 to the ten's digit and subtracting one from the unit's digit, the sum of the digits should remain the same. For example, 9 + 2 = 11 with 1 + 1 = 2.  When adding 9 to itself, we would thus expect the sum of the digits to be 9 as follows: 9 + 9 = 18, (1 + 8 = 9) and 9 + 9 + 9 = 27, (2 + 7 = 9).  Let us look at a simple multiplication: 5×7 = 35, (3 + 5 = 8).  Now consider (7 + 9)×5 = 16×5 = 80, (8 + 0 = 8) or 7×(9 + 5) = 7×14 = 98, (9 + 8 = 17, (1 + 7 = 8).  

Any non-negative integer can be written as 9×n + a, where 'a' is a single digit from 0 to 8, and 'n' is some non-negative integer.
Thus, using the distributive rule, (9×n + a)×(9×m + b)= 9×9×n×m + 9(am + bn) + ab.  Since the first two factors are multiplied by 9, their sums will end up being 9 or 0, leaving us with 'ab'.  In our example, 'a' was 7 and 'b' was 5.  We would expect that in any base system, the number before that base would behave just like the nine.

== Limitation to casting out nines ==

While extremely useful, casting out nines does not catch all errors made while doing calculations. For example, the casting-out-nines method would not recognize the error in a calculation of 5 × 7 which produced any of the erroneous results 8, 17, 26, etc. (that is, any result congruent to 8 modulo 9).    In other words, the method only catches erroneous results whose digital root is one of the 8 digits that is different from that of the correct result.

==History==
A form of casting out nines known to ancient Greek mathematicians was described by the Roman bishop [[Hippolytus_of_Rome|Hippolytus]] (170–235) in ''[[Refutation of All Heresies|The Refutation of all Heresies]]'', and more briefly by the Syrian Neoplatonist philosopher [[Iamblichus]] (c.245–c.325) in his commentary on the ''[[Introduction to Arithmetic]]'' of  [[Nicomachus|Nicomachus of Gerasa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Heath|1921|pp=[https://archive.org/stream/cu31924008704219#page/n134/mode/1up 113–117]}}, {{harvtxt|Hippolytus of Rome|1919|pp=[https://archive.org/stream/antenicenefather05robe#page/30/mode/1up 30–32]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Both Hippolytus's and Iamblichus's descriptions, though, were limited to an explanation of how repeated digital sums of [[Greek numerals]] were used to compute a unique "root"&lt;ref&gt;The Greek term used by Hippolytus was "''πυθμήν''" ("''pythmen''").&lt;/ref&gt; between 1 and 9.  Neither of them displayed any awareness of how the procedure could be used to check the results of arithmetical computations.

The earliest known surviving work which describes how casting out nines can be used to check the results of arithmetical computations is the ''Mahâsiddhânta'', written around 950 by the Indian mathematician and astronomer, [[Aryabhata II]] (c.920–c.1000 ).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Datta|Singh|1962|pp=[https://archive.org/stream/HinduMathematics#page/n191/mode/1up 180–184]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Writing about 1020, the Persian polymath, Ibn Sina ([[Avicenna]]) (c.980–1037), also gave full details of what he called the "Hindu method" of checking arithmetical calculations by casting out nines.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Datta|Singh|1962|p=[https://archive.org/stream/HinduMathematics#page/n195/mode/1up 184]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Synergetics (Fuller)|Synergetics]]'', [[Buckminster Fuller|R. Buckminster Fuller]] claims to have used casting-out-nines "before World War I."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Fuller|1982|p=765}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Fuller explains how to cast out nines and makes other claims about the resulting 'indigs,' but he fails to note that casting out nines can result in false positives.

The method bears striking resemblance to standard [[signal processing]] and computational [[error detection]] and [[error correction]] methods, typically using similar modular arithmetic in [[checksum]]s and simpler [[check digit]]s.

==Generalization==
This method can be generalized to determine the remainders of division by certain prime numbers.

Since 3&amp;middot;3 = 9,
: &lt;math&gt; n \mod 3 = ( n \mod 9 ) \mod 3 &lt;/math&gt;.
So we can use the remainder from casting out nines to get the remainder of division by three.

Casting out ninety nines is done by adding groups of two digits instead just one digit.

Since 11&amp;middot;9 = 99,
: &lt;math&gt; n \mod 11 = ( n \mod 99 ) \mod 11 &lt;/math&gt;.
So we can use the remainder from casting out ninety nines to get the remainder of division by eleven. This is called '''casting out elevens'''.

Casting out nine hundred ninety nines is done by adding groups of three digits.

Since 37&amp;middot;27 = 999,
: &lt;math&gt; n \mod 37 = ( n \mod 999 ) \mod 37 &lt;/math&gt;.
So we can use the remainder from casting out nine hundred ninety nines to get the remainder of division by thirty seven.

In [[quantum information]] and [[quantum computing]], a '''cluster state'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=H. J. Briegel |author2=R. Raussendorf | title=Persistent Entanglement in arrays of Interacting Particles |journal=[[Physical Review Letters]]| year=2001 |volume=86 | doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.86.910 | pmid=11177971 | issue=5 | bibcode=2001PhRvL..86..910B | pages=910–3|arxiv = quant-ph/0004051 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is a type of highly entangled state of multiple [[qubit]]s. Cluster states are generated in [[lattice (group)|lattice]]s of qubits with [[Ising model|Ising]] type interactions. A cluster ''C'' is a connected subset of a d-dimensional lattice, and a cluster state is a pure state of the qubits located on ''C''. They are different from other types of entangled states such as [[GHZ state]]s or [[W state]]s in that it is more difficult to eliminate [[quantum entanglement]] (via [[projective measurement]]s) in the case  of cluster states. Another way of thinking of cluster states is as a particular instance of [[graph state]]s, where the underlying graph is a connected subset of a d-dimensional lattice. Cluster states are especially useful in the context of the [[one-way quantum computer]]. For a comprehensible introduction to the topic see.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Briegel |first=Hans J. |editor-last1=Greenberger |editor-first1=Daniel |editor-last2=Hentschel |editor-first2=Klaus |editor-last3=Weinert |editor-first3=Friedel |title=Compendium of Quantum Physics - Concepts, Experiments, History and Philosophy |publisher=Springer |pages=96–105 |chapter=Cluster States |isbn=978-3-540-70622-9|lastauthoramp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Formally, cluster states &lt;math&gt;|\phi_{\{\kappa\}}\rangle_{C}&lt;/math&gt; are states which obey the set eigenvalue equations:

: &lt;math&gt;K^{(a)} {\left|\phi_{\{\kappa\}}\right\rangle_{C}} =(-1)^{\kappa_{a}} {\left|\phi_{\{\kappa\}}\right\rangle_{C}} &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;K^{(a)}&lt;/math&gt; are the correlation operators

: &lt;math&gt;K^{(a)} = \sigma_x^{(a)} \bigotimes_{b\in \mathrm{N}(a)} \sigma_z^{(b)} &lt;/math&gt;

with &lt;math&gt;\sigma_x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sigma_z&lt;/math&gt; being [[Pauli matrices]], &lt;math&gt;N(a)&lt;/math&gt; denoting the [[Neighbourhood (graph theory)|neighbourhood]] of &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\{\kappa_a\in\{0,1\}|a\in C\}&lt;/math&gt; being a set of binary parameters specifying the particular instance of a cluster state.

Cluster states have been realized experimentally. They have been obtained in photonic experiments using

Sometimes there are several words of equal minimum weight in a coset, and in that case, any one of those words may be chosen to be the coset leader.

Coset leaders are used in the construction of a [[standard array]] for a [[linear code]], which can then be used to decode received vectors. For a received vector ''y'', the decoded message is ''y - e'', where ''e'' is the coset leader of ''y''. Coset leaders can also be used to construct a fast decoding strategy. For each coset leader ''u'' we calculate the syndrome ''uH&amp;prime;''. When we receive ''v'' we evaluate ''vH&amp;prime;'' and find the matching [[Decoding methods#Syndrome decoding|syndrome]]. The corresponding coset leader is the most likely error pattern and we assume that ''v''+''u'' was the codeword sent.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14154">In [[mathematics]] the '''cotangent complex''' is roughly a universal linearization of a [[morphism]] of geometric or algebraic objects.  Cotangent complexes were originally defined in special cases by a number of authors. [[Luc Illusie]], [[Daniel Quillen]], and M. André independently came up with a definition that works in all cases.

==Motivation==
Suppose that ''X'' and ''Y'' are [[algebraic variety|algebraic varieties]] and that {{nowrap|''f'' : ''X'' → ''Y''}} is a morphism between them.  The cotangent complex of ''f'' is a more universal version of the relative [[Kähler differentials]] Ω&lt;sub&gt;''X''/''Y''&lt;/sub&gt;. The most basic motivation for such an object is the exact sequence of Kähler differentials associated to two morphisms. If ''Z'' is another variety, and if {{nowrap|''g'' : ''Y'' → ''Z''}} is another morphism, then there is an exact sequence
:&lt;math&gt;f^*\Omega_{Y/Z} \to \Omega_{X/Z} \to \Omega_{X/Y} \to 0.&lt;/math&gt;
In some sense, therefore, relative Kähler differentials are a [[right exact functor]]. (Literally this is not true, however, because the category of algebraic varieties is not an [[abelian category]], and therefore right-exactness is not defined.) In fact, prior to the definition of the cotangent complex, there were several definitions of functors that might extend the sequence further to the left, such as the [[Lichtenbaum–Schlessinger functor]]s ''T''&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt; and [[imperfection module]]s. Most of these were motivated by [[deformation theory]].

This sequence is exact on the left if the morphism ''f'' is smooth. If Ω admitted a first [[derived functor]], then exactness on the left would imply that the [[connecting homomorphism]] vanished, and this would certainly be true if the first derived functor of ''f'', whatever it was, vanished. Therefore, a reasonable speculation is that the first derived functor of a smooth morphism vanishes. Furthermore, when any of the functors which extended the sequence of Kähler differentials were applied to a smooth morphism, they too vanished, which suggested that the cotangent complex of a smooth morphism might be equivalent to the Kähler differentials.

Another natural exact sequence related to Kähler differentials is the [[conormal exact sequence]]. If ''f'' is a closed immersion with ideal sheaf ''I'', then there is an exact sequence
:&lt;math&gt;I/I^2 \to f^*\Omega_{Y/Z} \to \Omega_{X/Z} \to 0.&lt;/math&gt;
This is an extension of the exact sequence above: There is a new term on the left, the conormal sheaf of ''f'', and the relative differentials Ω&lt;sub&gt;''X''/''Y''&lt;/sub&gt; have vanished because a closed immersion is [[formally unramified]]. If ''f'' is the inclusion of a smooth subvariety, then this sequence is a short exact sequence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Grothendieck|year = 1967|loc = Proposition 17.2.5|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests that the cotangent complex of the inclusion of a smooth variety is equivalent to the conormal sheaf shifted by one term.

==Early work on cotangent complexes==
The cotangent complex dates back at least to SGA 6 VIII 2, where [[Pierre Berthelot]] gave a definition when ''f'' is a ''smoothable'' morphism, meaning there is a scheme ''V'' and morphisms {{nowrap|''i'' : ''X'' → ''V''}} and {{nowrap|''h'' : ''V'' → ''Y''}} such that {{nowrap|''f'' {{=}} ''hi''}}, ''i'' is a closed immersion, and ''h'' is a smooth morphism. (For example, all projective morphisms are smoothable, since ''V'' can be taken to be a projective bundle over ''Y''.) In this case, he defines the cotangent complex of ''f'' as an object in the [[derived category]] of [[coherent sheaf|coherent sheaves]] ''X'' as follows:
*&lt;math&gt;L^{X/Y}_0 = i^*\Omega_{V/Y},&lt;/math&gt;
*If ''J'' is the ideal of ''X'' in ''V'', then &lt;math&gt;L^{X/Y}_1 = J/J^2 = i^*J&lt;/math&gt;,
*&lt;math&gt;L^{X/Y}_i = 0&lt;/math&gt; for all other ''i'',
*The differential &lt;math&gt;L^{X/Y}_1 \to L^{X/Y}_0&lt;/math&gt; is the pullback along ''i'' of the inclusion of ''J'' in the structure sheaf &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{O}_V&lt;/math&gt; of ''V'' followed by the universal derivation &lt;math&gt;d : \mathcal{O}_V \to \Omega_{V/Y}&lt;/math&gt;.
*All other differentials are zero.
Berthelot proves that this definition is independent of the choice of ''V''&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Berthelot|year = 1966|loc = VIII Proposition 2.2|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that for a smoothable complete intersection morphism, this complex is perfect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Berthelot|year = 1966|loc = VIII Proposition 2.4|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, he proves that if {{nowrap|''g'' : ''Y'' → ''Z''}} is another smoothable complete intersection morphism and if an additional technical condition is satisfied, then there is an [[exact triangle]]
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{L}f^*L^{Y/Z}_\bullet \to L^{X/Z}_\bullet \to L^{X/Y}_\bullet \to \mathbf{L}f^*L^{Y/Z}_\bullet[1].&lt;/math&gt;

==The definition of the cotangent complex==
The correct definition of the cotangent complex begins in the [[homotopic algebra|homotopical setting]]. Quillen and André worked with the [[simplicial set#Simplicial objects|simplicial]] commutative rings, while Illusie worked with simplicial ringed [[topos|topoi]]. For simplicity, we will consider only the case of simplicial commutative rings. Suppose that ''A'' and ''B'' are [[simplicial ring]]s and that ''B'' is an ''A''-algebra. Choose a resolution {{nowrap|''r'' : ''P''&lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt; → ''B''}} of ''B'' by simplicial free ''A''-algebras. Applying the Kähler differential functor to ''P''&lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt; produces a simplicial ''B''-module. The total complex of this simplicial object is the '''cotangent complex''' ''L''&lt;sup&gt;''B''/''A''&lt;/sup&gt;. The morphism ''r'' induces a morphism from the cotangent complex to Ω&lt;sub&gt;''B''/''A''&lt;/sub&gt; called the '''augmentation map'''. In the homotopy category of simplicial ''A''-algebras (or of simplicial ringed topoi), this construction amounts to taking the left derived functor of the Kähler differential functor.

Given a commutative square as follows:

there is a morphism of cotangent complexes {{nowrap|''L''&lt;sup&gt;''B''/''A''&lt;/sup&gt; ⊗&lt;sub&gt;''B''&lt;/sub&gt; ''D'' → ''L''&lt;sup&gt;''D''/''C''&lt;/sup&gt;}} which respects the augmentation maps. This map is constructed by choosing a free simplicial ''C''-algebra resolution of ''D'', say {{nowrap|''s'' : ''Q''&lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt; → ''D''}}. Because ''P''&lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt; is a free object, the composite ''hr'' can be lifted to a morphism {{nowrap|''P''&lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt; → ''Q''&lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;}}. Applying functoriality of Kähler differentials to this morphism gives the required morphism of cotangent complexes. In particular, given homomorphisms {{nowrap|''A'' &amp;rarr; ''B'' &amp;rarr; ''C''}}, this produces the sequence
:&lt;math&gt;L^{B/A} \otimes_B C \to L^{C/A} \to L^{C/B}.&lt;/math&gt;
There is a connecting homomorphism &lt;math&gt;L^{C/B} \to (L^{B/A} \otimes_B C)[1]&lt;/math&gt; which turns this sequence into an exact triangle.

The cotangent complex can also be defined in any combinatorial [[model category]] ''M''. Suppose that &lt;math&gt;f\colon A\rightarrow B&lt;/math&gt; is a morphism in ''M''.  The cotangent complex &lt;math&gt;L^f&lt;/math&gt; (or &lt;math&gt;L^{B/A}&lt;/math&gt;) is an object in the category of spectra in &lt;math&gt;M_{B//B}&lt;/math&gt;.  A pair of composable morphisms &lt;math&gt;A\xrightarrow{f} B\xrightarrow{g} C&lt;/math&gt; induces an exact triangle in the homotopy category, &lt;math&gt;L^{B/A}\otimes_BC\rightarrow L^{C/A}\rightarrow L^{C/B}\rightarrow (L^{B/A}\otimes_BC)[1]&lt;/math&gt;.

==Properties of the cotangent complex==

===Flat base change===
Suppose that ''B'' and ''C'' are ''A''-algebras such that {{nowrap|Tor&lt;sup&gt;''A''&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;''q''&lt;/sub&gt;(''B'', ''C'') {{=}} 0}} for all {{nowrap|''q'' &gt; 0}}. Then there are quasi-isomorphisms&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Quillen|year = 1970|loc = Theorem 5.3|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;L^{B \otimes_A C/C} \cong B \otimes_A L^{C/A},&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;L^{B \otimes_A C/A} \cong (L^{B/A} \otimes_A C) \oplus (B \otimes_A L^{C/A}).&lt;/math&gt;
If ''C'' is a flat ''A''-algebra, then the condition that {{nowrap|Tor&lt;sup&gt;''A''&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;''q''&lt;/sub&gt;(''B'', ''C'')}} vanishes for {{nowrap|''q'' &gt; 0}} is automatic. The first formula then proves that the construction of the cotangent complex is local on the base in the [[flat topology]].

===Vanishing properties===
Let {{nowrap|''f'' : ''A'' &amp;rarr; ''B''}}. Then:&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Quillen|year = 1970|loc = Theorem 5.4|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Quillen|year = 1970|loc = Corollary 6.14|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*If ''B'' is a [[localization of a ring|localization]] of ''A'', then {{nowrap|''L''&lt;sup&gt;''B''/''A''&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} 0}}.
*If ''f'' is an [[étale morphism]], then {{nowrap|''L''&lt;sup&gt;''B''/''A''&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} 0}}.
*If ''f'' is a [[smooth morphism]], then {{nowrap|''L''&lt;sup&gt;''B''/''A''&lt;/sup&gt;}} is quasi-isomorphic to Ω&lt;sub&gt;''B''/''A''&lt;/sub&gt;. In particular, it has [[projective dimension]] zero.
*If ''f'' is a [[local complete intersection morphism]], then {{nowrap|''L''&lt;sup&gt;''B''/''A''&lt;/sup&gt;}} has projective dimension at most one.
*If ''A'' is Noetherian, {{nowrap|''B'' {{=}} ''A''/''I''}}, and ''I'' is generated by a regular sequence, then &lt;math&gt;I/I^2&lt;/math&gt; is a [[projective module]] and ''L''&lt;sup&gt;''B''/''A''&lt;/sup&gt; is quasi-isomorphic to &lt;math&gt;I/I^2[1]&lt;/math&gt;.

==Examples==
*Let &lt;math&gt;X \in \text{Sch}/S&lt;/math&gt; be smooth. Then the cotangent complex is &lt;math&gt;\Omega_{X/S}&lt;/math&gt;. In Berthelot's framework, this is clear by taking &lt;math&gt;V=X&lt;/math&gt;. In general, étale locally on &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a finite dimensional affine space and the morphism &lt;math&gt;X\to S&lt;/math&gt; is projection, so we may reduce to the situation where &lt;math&gt;S=\text{Spec}(A)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;X = \text{Spec}(A[x_1,\ldots,x_n])&lt;/math&gt;. We can take the resolution of &lt;math&gt;\text{Spec}(A[x_1,\ldots,x_n])&lt;/math&gt; to be the identity map, and then it is clear that the cotangent complex is the same as the Kähler differentials.
*Let &lt;math&gt;i:X \to Y&lt;/math&gt; be a closed embedding of smooth schemes in &lt;math&gt;\text{Sch}/S&lt;/math&gt;. Using the exact triangle corresponding to the morphisms &lt;math&gt;X \to Y \to S&lt;/math&gt;, we may determine the cotangent complex &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{L}_{X/Y}&lt;/math&gt;. To do this, note that by the previous example, the cotangent complexes &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{L}_{X/S}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{L}_{Y/S}&lt;/math&gt; consist of the Kähler differentials &lt;math&gt;\Omega_{X/S}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Omega_{Y/S}&lt;/math&gt; in the zeroth degree, respectively, and are zero in all other degrees. The exact triangle implies that &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{L}_{X/Y}&lt;/math&gt; is nonzero only in the first degree, and in that degree, it is the kernel of the map &lt;math&gt;i^*\mathbf{L}_{X/S} \to \mathbf{L}_{Y/S}&lt;/math&gt;. This kernel is the conormal bundle, and the exact sequence is the conormal exact sequence, so in the first degree, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{L}_{X/Y}&lt;/math&gt; is the conormal bundle &lt;math&gt;C_{X/Y}&lt;/math&gt;.
*More generally, a local complete intersection morphism &lt;math&gt;X \to Y&lt;/math&gt; with a smooth target has a cotangent complex perfect in amplitude &lt;math&gt;[-1,0]&lt;/math&gt;. This is given by the complex
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{I}{I^2} \to \Omega_{Y}|_X&lt;/math&gt;
For example, the cotangent complex of the twisted cubic &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{P}^3&lt;/math&gt; is given by the complex
:&lt;math&gt;
\mathcal{O}(-2)\oplus\mathcal{O}(-2)\oplus\mathcal{O}(-2) \xrightarrow{s} \Omega_{\mathbb{P}^3}|_X
&lt;/math&gt;

[[File:Portrait daniel mccartney.jpg|thumb|left]]
'''Daniel McCartney''' (September 10, 1817 – November 15, 1887) was an American who had what is now known as [[Hyperthymesia|HSAM--Highly Superior Autobiographical Memory]], formerly Hyperthymesia.

McCartney was born in [[Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania]]. He was [[legally blind]] and lived with relatives throughout his lifetime. For a large part of his life, he resided in [[Morrow County, Ohio]], before his final days in [[Muscatine, Iowa]]. He never married.

McCartney was famous for his mental ability in two specific areas. First, he remembered every single day in his life from the age of nine until his death. Given any specific calendar date, McCartney in seconds could give the day of the week, describe the weather conditions, describe what he did during the day, describe what he ate during the day, and could provide details of local, regional and national events on that day. In a similar case as McCartney's, noted neurobiologist [[James McGaugh]] of the [[University of California, Irvine]], one of the world's leading experts on [[human memory]], reports on a woman, [[Jill Price]], with the astonishing ability to clearly remember events that happened to her decades ago. McGaugh labels this one-of-a-kind ability as [[Hyperthymesia]] (National Public Radio, 2006). McCartney's mental aptitude appears to be nearly identical to this recent case reported in McGaugh's study. McCartney, however, had an additional mental ability:  mathematical computation.

McCartney could mentally compute difficult mathematical computations in seconds, and extremely difficult ones in minutes. McCartney was tested several times by panels of university mathematicians in which he was given a battery of mathematical questions. On one such examination in July 1870 in [[Salem, Ohio]], McCartney was asked to take 89 to the sixth power, which he mentally computed in ten minutes, giving the correct answer of 496,981,290,961. On another examination he was asked to provide the [[cube root]] of 4,741,632 for which he answered correctly in three minutes-(168); and 389,017 for which he answered correctly in fifteen seconds-(73).

On occasion, special sessions for the general public were held to witness mental examinations of McCartney's unique abilities. During these public exhibitions, he was always correct in his responses, and would provide a response in a matter of seconds to the amazement of audiences.

He died at the age of 70 in [[Wilton, Iowa]]. McCartney was reported to be one of a number of great [[mental calculators]] (Henkle, 1871).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1245">In physics, the '''differential coefficient''' of a function ''f''(''x'') is what is now called its [[derivative]] ''df''(''x'')/''dx'', the (not necessarily constant) multiplicative factor or ''[[coefficient]]'' of the [[differential (mathematics)|differential]] ''dx'' in the differential ''df''(''x'').  

A ''coefficient'' is usually a [[constant (mathematics)|constant]] quantity, but the ''differential coefficient'' of ''f'' is a ''constant function'' only if ''f'' is a [[linear function]].  When ''f'' is ''not'' linear, its differential coefficient is a function, call it ''f''&amp;prime;, ''derived'' by the [[Derivative#Differentiation and the derivative|differentiation]] of ''f'', hence, the modern term, derivative.

The older usage is now rarely seen. 

Early editions of [[Silvanus P. Thompson]]'s ''[[Calculus Made Easy]]'' use the older term.  In his 1998 update of this text, [[Martin Gardner]] lets the first use of "differential coefficient" stand, along with Thompson's criticism of the term as a needlessly obscure phrase that should not intimidate students, and substitutes "derivative" for the remainder of the book.

In [[mathematics]], and specifically in [[number theory]], a '''divisor function''' is an [[arithmetic function]] related to the [[divisor]]s of an [[integer]]. When referred to as ''the'' divisor function, it counts the ''number of divisors of an integer'' (including 1 and the number itself). It appears in a number of remarkable identities, including relationships on the [[Riemann zeta function]] and the [[Eisenstein series]] of [[modular form]]s. Divisor functions were studied by [[Ramanujan]], who gave a number of important [[Modular arithmetic|congruences]] and [[identity (mathematics)|identities]]; these are treated separately in the article [[Ramanujan's sum]].

A related function is the [[divisor summatory function]], which, as the name implies, is a sum over the divisor function.

==Definition==
The '''sum of positive divisors function''' σ&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;(''n''), for a real or complex number ''x'', is defined as the [[summation|sum]] of the ''x''th [[Exponentiation|powers]] of the positive [[divisor]]s of ''n''.  It can be expressed in [[Summation#Capital-sigma notation|sigma notation]] as

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_x(n)=\sum_{d\mid n} d^x\,\! ,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;{d\mid n}&lt;/math&gt; is shorthand for "''d'' [[divides]] ''n''".
The notations ''d''(''n''), ν(''n'') and τ(''n'') (for the German ''Teiler'' = divisors) are also used to denote σ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(''n''), or the '''number-of-divisors function'''&lt;ref name="Long 1972 46"&gt;{{harvtxt|Long|1972|p=46}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Pettofrezzo|Byrkit|1970|p=63}}&lt;/ref&gt; ({{OEIS2C|id=A000005}}). When ''x'' is 1, the function is called the '''sigma function''' or '''sum-of-divisors function''',&lt;ref name="Long 1972 46"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Pettofrezzo|Byrkit|1970|p=58}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the subscript is often omitted, so σ(''n'') is the same as σ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''n'') ({{OEIS2C|id=A000203}}).

The '''aliquot sum''' ''s''(''n'') of ''n'' is the sum of the [[proper divisor]]s (that is, the divisors excluding ''n'' itself, {{OEIS2C|id=A001065}}), and equals σ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''n'')&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''n''; the [[aliquot sequence]] of ''n'' is formed by repeatedly applying the aliquot sum function.

==Example==
For example, σ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(12) is the number of the divisors of 12:

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\sigma_{0}(12) &amp; = 1^0 + 2^0 + 3^0 + 4^0 + 6^0 + 12^0 \\
&amp; = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 6,
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

while σ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(12) is the sum of all the divisors:

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\sigma_{1}(12) &amp; = 1^1 + 2^1 + 3^1 + 4^1 + 6^1 + 12^1 \\
&amp; = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 12 = 28,
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

and the aliquot sum s(12) of proper divisors is:

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
s(12) &amp; = 1^1 + 2^1 + 3^1 + 4^1 + 6^1 \\
&amp; = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 = 16.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

==Properties==

===Formulas at prime powers===

For a [[prime number]] ''p'',

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\sigma_0(p) &amp; = 2 \\
\sigma_0(p^n) &amp; = n+1 \\
\sigma_1(p) &amp; = p+1
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

because by definition, the factors of a prime number are 1 and itself.  Also, where ''p&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''# denotes the [[primorial]],

:&lt;math&gt; \sigma_0(p_n\#) = 2^n \, &lt;/math&gt;

since ''n'' prime factors allow a sequence of binary selection (&lt;math&gt;p_{i}&lt;/math&gt; or 1) from ''n'' terms for each proper divisor formed.

Clearly, &lt;math&gt;1 &lt; \sigma_0(n) &lt; n&lt;/math&gt; and σ(''n'')&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;''n'' for all&amp;nbsp;''n''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;2.

The divisor function is [[multiplicative function|multiplicative]], but not [[Completely multiplicative function|completely multiplicative]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\gcd(a, b)=1 \Longrightarrow \sigma_x(ab)=\sigma_x(a)\sigma_x(b).&lt;/math&gt;

The consequence of this is that, if we write

:&lt;math&gt;n = \prod_{i=1}^r p_i^{a_i}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''r''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''ω''(''n'') is the number of distinct [[prime factor]]s of ''n'', ''p&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the ''i''th prime factor, and ''a&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the maximum power of ''p&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' by which ''n'' is [[divisible]], then we have: {{sfnp|Hardy|Wright|2008|pp=310 f|loc=§16.7}}
:&lt;math&gt;
\sigma_x(n) = \prod_{i=1}^r \sum_{j=0}^{a_i} p_i^{j x} = 
\prod_{i=1}^r (1 + p_i^x + p_i^{2x} + \cdots + p_i^{a_i x}).
&lt;/math&gt;

which is equivalent to the useful formula: {{sfnp|Hardy|Wright|2008|pp=310 f|loc=§16.7}}
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_x(n) = \prod_{i=1}^{r} \frac{p_{i}^{(a_{i}+1)x}-1}{p_{i}^x-1}.&lt;/math&gt;

It follows (by setting ''x'' = 0) that ''d''(''n'') is: {{sfnp|Hardy|Wright|2008|pp=310 f|loc=§16.7}}
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_0(n)=\prod_{i=1}^r (a_i+1).&lt;/math&gt;

For example, if ''n'' is 24, there are two prime factors (''p&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' is 2; ''p&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' is 3); noting that 24 is the product of 2&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;×3&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is 3 and ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is 1.  Thus we can calculate &lt;math&gt;\sigma_0(24)&lt;/math&gt; as so:

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\sigma_0(24) &amp; = \prod_{i=1}^{2} (a_i+1) \\
&amp; = (3 + 1)(1 + 1) = 4 \cdot 2 = 8.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

The eight divisors counted by this formula are 1, 2, 4, 8, 3, 6, 12, and 24.

===Other properties and identities===
Euler proved the remarkable recurrence:
&lt;ref&gt;https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0411587, &lt;i&gt;An observation on the sums of divisors&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://eulerarchive.maa.org//pages/E175.html, &lt;i&gt;Decouverte d'une loi tout extraordinaire des nombres par rapport a la somme de leurs diviseurs&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{array}{rcl}
\sigma(n) &amp; = &amp; \sigma(n{-}1)+\sigma(n{-}2)-\sigma(n{-}5)-\sigma(n{-}7)+\sigma(n{-}12)+\sigma(n{-}15)+ \cdots
\\
&amp; = &amp;\sum_{i\in\mathbb{Z}} (-1)^{i+1}\left(\sigma(n{-}\frac12(3i^2{-}i))+\delta(n,\frac12(3i^2{-}i))\,n\right)
\end{array}
&lt;/math&gt;

where we set &lt;math&gt;\sigma(i)=0&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;i\leq0&lt;/math&gt;,
we use the Kronecker delta &lt;math&gt;\delta(\cdot,\cdot)&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\tfrac12(3i^2{-}i)&lt;/math&gt; are the [[pentagonal numbers]].  Indeed, Euler proved this by logarithmic differentiation of the identity in his [[Pentagonal number theorem]].

For a non-square integer, ''n'', every divisor, ''d'', of ''n'' is paired with divisor ''n''/''d'' of ''n'' and &lt;math&gt;\sigma_{0}(n)&lt;/math&gt; is even; for a square integer, one divisor (namely &lt;math&gt;\sqrt n&lt;/math&gt;) is not paired with a distinct divisor and &lt;math&gt;\sigma_{0}(n)&lt;/math&gt; is odd.  Similarly, the number &lt;math&gt;\sigma_{1}(n)&lt;/math&gt; is odd if and only if ''n'' is a square or twice a square.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

We also note ''s''(''n'') = ''σ''(''n'')&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''n''. Here ''s''(''n'') denotes the sum of the proper divisors of ''n'', that is, the divisors of ''n'' excluding ''n'' itself.
This function is the one used to recognize [[perfect number]]s which are the ''n'' for which ''s''(''n'') =&amp;nbsp;''n''.  If ''s''(''n'') &gt; ''n'' then ''n'' is an [[abundant number]] and if ''s''(''n'') &lt; ''n'' then ''n'' is a [[deficient number]].

If n is a power of 2, for example, &lt;math&gt;n = 2^k&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\sigma(n) = 2 \cdot 2^k - 1 = 2n - 1,&lt;/math&gt; and ''s(n) = n - 1'', which makes ''n'' [[Almost perfect number|almost-perfect]].

As an example, for two distinct primes ''p'' and ''q'' with ''p &lt; q'', let

:&lt;math&gt;n = pq. \, &lt;/math&gt;

Then
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma(n) = (p+1)(q+1) = n + 1 + (p+q), \, &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\varphi(n) = (p-1)(q-1) = n + 1 - (p+q), \, &lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;n + 1 = (\sigma(n) + \varphi(n))/2, \, &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;p + q = (\sigma(n) - \varphi(n))/2, \, &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\varphi(n)&lt;/math&gt; is [[Euler phi|Euler's totient function]].

Then, the roots of:
:&lt;math&gt;(x-p)(x-q) = x^2 - (p+q)x + n = x^2 - [(\sigma(n) - \varphi(n))/2]x + [(\sigma(n) + \varphi(n))/2 - 1] = 0 \, &lt;/math&gt;
allow us to express ''p'' and ''q'' in terms of ''σ''(''n'') and ''φ''(''n'') only, without even knowing ''n'' or ''p+q'', as:
:&lt;math&gt;p = (\sigma(n) - \varphi(n))/4 - \sqrt{[(\sigma(n) - \varphi(n))/4]^2 - [(\sigma(n) + \varphi(n))/2 - 1]}, \, &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;q = (\sigma(n) - \varphi(n))/4 + \sqrt{[(\sigma(n) - \varphi(n))/4]^2 - [(\sigma(n) + \varphi(n))/2 - 1]}. \, &lt;/math&gt;

Also, knowing n and either &lt;math&gt;\sigma(n)&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\varphi(n)&lt;/math&gt; (or knowing p+q and either &lt;math&gt;\sigma(n)&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\varphi(n)&lt;/math&gt;) allows us to easily find ''p'' and ''q''.

In 1984, [[Roger Heath-Brown]] proved that the equality

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_0(n) = \sigma_0(n + 1)&lt;/math&gt;

is true for an infinity of values of n, see {{OEIS2C|A005237}}.

==Series relations==
Two [[Dirichlet series]] involving the divisor function are: {{sfnp|Hardy|Wright|2008|pp=326-328|loc=§17.5}}

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{\sigma_{a}(n)}{n^s} = \zeta(s) \zeta(s-a)\quad\text{for}\quad s&gt;1,s&gt;a+1,&lt;/math&gt;

which for ''d''(''n'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''&amp;sigma;''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(''n'') gives: {{sfnp|Hardy|Wright|2008|pp=326-328|loc=§17.5}}

: &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{d(n)}{n^s} = \zeta^2(s)\quad\text{for}\quad s&gt;1,&lt;/math&gt;

and {{sfnp|Hardy|Wright|2008|pp=334-337|loc=§17.8}}

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{\sigma_a(n)\sigma_b(n)}{n^s} = \frac{\zeta(s) \zeta(s-a) \zeta(s-b) \zeta(s-a-b)}{\zeta(2s-a-b)}.&lt;/math&gt;

A [[Lambert series]] involving the divisor function is: {{sfnp|Hardy|Wright|2008|pp=338-341|loc=§17.10}}

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^\infty q^n \sigma_a(n) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \sum_{j=1}^\infty n^a q^{j\,n} = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{n^a q^n}{1-q^n}&lt;/math&gt;

for arbitrary [[complex number|complex]] |''q''|&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;1 and&amp;nbsp;''a''.  This summation also appears as the Fourier series of the [[Eisenstein series]] and the invariants of the [[Weierstrass elliptic functions]].

For &lt;math&gt;k&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; exists an explicit series representation with [[Ramanujan sum]]s &lt;math&gt; c_m(n) &lt;/math&gt; as :&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=E. Krätzel |title=Zahlentheorie |publisher=VEB Deutscher Verlag der Wissenschaften |place =Berlin |year=1981 |pages=130}} (German)&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_k(n) = \zeta(k+1)n^k\sum_{m=1}^\infty \frac {c_m(n)}{m^{k+1}}.&lt;/math&gt;
The computation of the first terms of &lt;math&gt;c_m(n)&lt;/math&gt; shows its oscillations around the "average value" &lt;math&gt;\zeta(k+1)n^k&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_k(n) = \zeta(k+1)n^k \left[ 1 + \frac{(-1)^n}{2^{k+1}} + \frac{2\cos\frac {2\pi n}{3}}{3^{k+1}} + \frac{2\cos\frac {\pi n}{2}}{4^{k+1}} + \cdots\right]&lt;/math&gt;

==Growth rate&lt;!--linked from 'Thomas Hakon Grönwall'--&gt;==
In [[Big O notation#Little-o notation|little-o notation]], the divisor function satisfies the inequality:{{sfnp|Apostol|1976|p=296}}{{sfnp|Hardy|Wright|2008|pp=342-347|loc=§18.1}}
:&lt;math&gt;\mbox{for all }\varepsilon&gt;0,\quad d(n)=o(n^\varepsilon).&lt;/math&gt;
More precisely, [[Severin Wigert]] showed that:{{sfnp|Hardy|Wright|2008|pp=342-347|loc=§18.1}}
:&lt;math&gt;\limsup_{n\to\infty}\frac{\log d(n)}{\log n/\log\log n}=\log2.&lt;/math&gt;
On the other hand, since [[Euclid's theorem|there are infinitely many prime numbers]],{{sfnp|Hardy|Wright|2008|pp=342-347|loc=§18.1}}
:&lt;math&gt;\liminf_{n\to\infty} d(n)=2.&lt;/math&gt;

In [[Big-O notation]], [[Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet]] showed that the [[Average order of an arithmetic function|average order]] of the divisor function satisfies the following inequality:{{sfnp|Apostol|1976|loc=Theorem 3.3}}{{sfnp|Hardy|Wright|2008|pp=347-350|loc=§18.2}}
:&lt;math&gt;\mbox{for all } x\geq1, \sum_{n\leq x}d(n)=x\log x+(2\gamma-1)x+O(\sqrt{x}),&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is [[Euler–Mascheroni constant|Euler's gamma constant]]. Improving the bound &lt;math&gt;O(\sqrt{x})&lt;/math&gt; in this formula is known as [[Divisor summatory function#Dirichlet's divisor problem|Dirichlet's divisor problem]].

{{anchor|Robin's theorem|Robin's inequality|Grönwall's theorem}}

The behaviour of the sigma function is irregular. The asymptotic growth rate of the sigma function can be expressed by: {{sfnp|Hardy|Wright|2008|pp=469-471|loc=§22.9}}
:&lt;math&gt;
\limsup_{n\rightarrow\infty}\frac{\sigma(n)}{n\,\log \log n}=e^\gamma,
&lt;/math&gt;

where lim sup is the [[limit superior]].  This result is '''[[Thomas Hakon Grönwall|Grönwall]]'s theorem''', published in 1913 {{harv|Grönwall|1913}}. His proof uses [[Mertens' theorems|Mertens' 3rd theorem]], which says that:

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{1}{\log n}\prod_{p\le n}\frac{p}{p-1}=e^\gamma,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''p'' denotes a prime.

In 1915, Ramanujan proved that under the assumption of the [[Riemann hypothesis]], the inequality:
:&lt;math&gt;\ \sigma(n) &lt; e^\gamma n \log \log n &lt;/math&gt; (Robin's inequality)
holds for all sufficiently large ''n'' {{harv|Ramanujan|1997}}.  The largest known value that violates the inequality is ''n''=[[5040 (number)|5040]]. In 1984, [[Guy Robin]] proved that the inequality is true for all ''n'' &gt; 5040 [[if and only if]] the Riemann hypothesis is true {{harv|Robin|1984}}.  This is '''Robin's theorem''' and the inequality became known after him.  Robin furthermore showed that if the Riemann hypothesis is false then there are an infinite number of values of ''n'' that violate the inequality, and it is known that the smallest such ''n'' &gt; 5040 must be [[superabundant number|superabundant]] {{harv|Akbary|Friggstad|2009}}. It has been shown that the inequality holds for large odd and square-free integers, and that the Riemann hypothesis is equivalent to the inequality just for ''n'' divisible by the fifth power of a prime {{Harv|Choie|Lichiardopol|Moree|Solé|2007}}.

Robin also proved, unconditionally, that the inequality:
:&lt;math&gt;\ \sigma(n) &lt; e^\gamma n \log \log n + \frac{0.6483\ n}{\log \log n}&lt;/math&gt;
holds for all ''n'' ≥ 3.

A related bound was given by [[Jeffrey Lagarias]] in 2002, who proved that the Riemann hypothesis is equivalent to the statement that:
:&lt;math&gt; \sigma(n) &lt; H_n + \ln(H_n)e^{H_n}&lt;/math&gt;
for every [[natural number]] ''n'' &amp;gt; 1, where &lt;math&gt;H_n&lt;/math&gt; is the ''n''th [[harmonic number]], {{harv|Lagarias|2002}}.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16886">The '''eight-point algorithm''' is an algorithm used in [[computer vision]] to estimate the [[essential matrix]] or the [[Fundamental matrix (computer vision)|fundamental matrix]] related to a stereo camera pair from a set of corresponding image points.  It was introduced by [[Christopher Longuet-Higgins]] in 1981 for the case of the essential matrix.  In theory, this algorithm can be used also for the fundamental matrix, but in practice [[#The normalized eight-point algorithm|the normalized eight-point algorithm]], described by Richard Hartley in 1997, is better suited for this case.

The algorithm's name derives from the fact that it estimates the essential matrix or the fundamental matrix from a set of eight (or more) corresponding image points.  However, variations of the algorithm can be used for fewer than eight points.

== Coplanarity constraint ==
[[File:Epipolar Geometry1.svg|thumb|right|300px|'''Example of epipolar geometry.''' Two cameras, with their respective centers of projection points '''O'''&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; and '''O'''&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;, observe a point '''P'''.  The projection of '''P''' onto each of the image planes is denoted '''p'''&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; and '''p'''&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;.  Points '''E'''&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; and '''E'''&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; are the epipoles.]]
One may express the [[epipolar geometry]] of two cameras and a point in space with an algebraic equation. Observe that, no matter where the point &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is in space, the vectors  &lt;math&gt;\overline{O_L P}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\overline{O_R P}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \overline{O_R O_L}&lt;/math&gt; belong to the same plane.  Call &lt;math&gt;X_L&lt;/math&gt; the coordinates  of point &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; in the left eye's reference frame and call  &lt;math&gt;X_R&lt;/math&gt; the coordinates of &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; in the right eye's reference frame and call &lt;math&gt;R, T&lt;/math&gt; the rotation and translation between the two reference frames s.t. &lt;math&gt;X_R = R (X_L-T) &lt;/math&gt; is the relationship between the coordinates of &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; in the two reference frames. The following equation always equals to zero because the vector generated from &lt;math&gt;T \wedge X_L &lt;/math&gt; is orthogonal to both  &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; and  &lt;math&gt;X_L&lt;/math&gt; :
:&lt;math&gt;
 X_L^T T \wedge X_L -  T^T T \wedge X_L =  (X_L-T)^T  T \wedge X_L  = 0
&lt;/math&gt;

Because &lt;math&gt; I = R^T R &lt;/math&gt;, we get 
:&lt;math&gt;
 (X_L-T)^T R^T R T \wedge X_L  = 0
&lt;/math&gt;.

Replacing &lt;math&gt;(X_L-T)^TR^T &lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;X_R^T&lt;/math&gt;, we get
:&lt;math&gt;
 X_R^T R T \wedge X_L =  X_R^T R S X_L =  X_R^T E X_L = 0
&lt;/math&gt;

Observe that &lt;math&gt;T \wedge &lt;/math&gt; may be thought of as a matrix; Longuet-Higgins used the symbol &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; to denote it. The product &lt;math&gt; R T \wedge = R S &lt;/math&gt; is often called [[essential matrix]] and denoted with &lt;math&gt; E &lt;/math&gt;.

The vectors &lt;math&gt;\overline{O_L p_L}, \overline{O_R p_R}&lt;/math&gt; are parallel to the vectors &lt;math&gt; \overline{O_L P}, \overline{O_R P}&lt;/math&gt; and therefore the coplanarity constraint holds if we substitute these vectors. If we call &lt;math&gt;y, y'&lt;/math&gt; the coordinates of the projections of &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; onto the left and right image planes, then the coplanarity constraint may be written as

:&lt;math&gt;
 y'^T \mathbf{E} y = 0
&lt;/math&gt;

== The basic algorithm ==

The basic eight-point algorithm is here described for the case of estimating the essential matrix &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{E} &lt;/math&gt;.  It consists of three steps.  First, it formulates a [[homogeneous linear equation]], where the solution is directly related to &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{E} &lt;/math&gt;, and then solves the equation, taking into account that it may not have an exact solution.  Finally, the internal constraints of the resulting matrix are managed.  The first step is described in Longuet-Higgins' paper, the second and third steps are standard approaches in estimation theory.

The constraint defined by the essential matrix &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{E} &lt;/math&gt; is

:&lt;math&gt; (\mathbf{y}')^{T} \, \mathbf{E} \, \mathbf{y} = 0&lt;/math&gt;

for corresponding image points represented in normalized image coordinates &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{y}, \mathbf{y}' &lt;/math&gt;.  The problem which the algorithm solves is to determine &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{E} &lt;/math&gt; for a set of matching image points.  In practice, the image coordinates of the image points are affected by noise and the solution may also be over-determined which means that it may not be possible to find &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{E} &lt;/math&gt; which satisfies the above constraint exactly for all points.  This issue is addressed in the second step of the algorithm.

=== Step 1: Formulating a [[homogeneous linear equation]] ===

With

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{y} = \begin{pmatrix} y_{1} \\ y_{2} \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} &lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp; and &amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{y}' = \begin{pmatrix} y'_{1} \\ y'_{2} \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} &lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp; and &amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{E} = \begin{pmatrix} e_{11} &amp; e_{12} &amp; e_{13} \\ e_{21} &amp; e_{22} &amp; e_{23} \\ e_{31} &amp; e_{32} &amp; e_{33} \end{pmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;

the constraint can also be rewritten as

:&lt;math&gt; y'_1 y_1 e_{11} + y'_1 y_2 e_{12} + y'_1 e_{13} + y'_2 y_1 e_{21} + y'_2 y_2 e_{22} + y'_2 e_{23} + y_1 e_{31} + y_2 e_{32} + e_{33} = 0 \, &lt;/math&gt;

or

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{e} \cdot \tilde{\mathbf{y}} = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt; \tilde{\mathbf{y}} = \begin{pmatrix} y'_1 y_1 \\ y'_1 y_2 \\ y'_1 \\ y'_2 y_1 \\ y'_2 y_2 \\ y'_2 \\ y_1 \\ y_2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} &lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp; and &amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{e} = \begin{pmatrix} e_{11} \\ e_{12} \\ e_{13} \\ e_{21} \\ e_{22} \\ e_{23} \\ e_{31} \\ e_{32} \\ e_{33} \end{pmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;

that is, &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{e} &lt;/math&gt; represents the essential matrix in the form of a 9-dimensional vector and this vector must be orthogonal to the vector &lt;math&gt; \tilde{\mathbf{y}} &lt;/math&gt; which can be seen as a vector representation of the &lt;math&gt; 3 \times 3 &lt;/math&gt; matrix &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{y}' \, \mathbf{y}^{T} &lt;/math&gt;.

Each pair of corresponding image points produces a vector &lt;math&gt; \tilde{\mathbf{y}} &lt;/math&gt;. Given a set of 3D points &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{P}_k &lt;/math&gt; this corresponds to a set of vectors &lt;math&gt; \tilde{\mathbf{y}}_{k} &lt;/math&gt; and all of them must satisfy

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{e} \cdot \tilde{\mathbf{y}}_{k} = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

for the vector &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{e} &lt;/math&gt;. Given sufficiently many (at least eight) linearly independent vectors &lt;math&gt; \tilde{\mathbf{y}}_{k} &lt;/math&gt; it is possible to determine &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{e} &lt;/math&gt; in a straightforward way. Collect all vectors &lt;math&gt; \tilde{\mathbf{y}}_{k} &lt;/math&gt; as the columns of a matrix &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{Y} &lt;/math&gt; and it must then be the case that

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{e}^{T} \, \mathbf{Y} = \mathbf{0} &lt;/math&gt;

This means that &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{e} &lt;/math&gt; is the solution to a [[homogeneous linear equation]].

=== Step 2: Solving the equation ===

A standard approach to solving this equation implies that &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{e} &lt;/math&gt; is a [[Singular value decomposition|left singular vector]] of &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{Y} &lt;/math&gt; corresponding to a [[Singular value decomposition|singular value]] that equals zero.  Provided that at least eight linearly independent vectors &lt;math&gt; \tilde{\mathbf{y}}_{k} &lt;/math&gt; are used to construct &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{Y} &lt;/math&gt; it follows that this singular vector is unique (disregarding scalar multiplication) and, consequently, &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{e} &lt;/math&gt; and then &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{E} &lt;/math&gt; can be determined.

In the case that more than eight corresponding points are used to construct &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{Y} &lt;/math&gt; it is possible that it does not have any singular value equal to zero.  This case occurs in practice when the image coordinates are affected by various types of noise.  A common approach to deal with this situation is to describe it as a [[total least squares]] problem; find &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{e} &lt;/math&gt; which minimizes

:&lt;math&gt; \| \mathbf{e}^{T} \, \mathbf{Y} \| &lt;/math&gt;

when &lt;math&gt; \| \mathbf{e} \| = 1 &lt;/math&gt;.  The solution is to choose &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{e} &lt;/math&gt; as the left singular vector corresponding to the ''smallest'' singular value of &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{Y} &lt;/math&gt;.  A reordering of this &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{e} &lt;/math&gt; back into a &lt;math&gt; 3 \times 3 &lt;/math&gt; matrix gives the result of this step, here referred to as &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{E}_{\rm est} &lt;/math&gt;.

=== Step 3: Enforcing the internal constraint ===

Another consequence of dealing with noisy image coordinates is that the resulting matrix may not satisfy the internal constraint of the essential matrix, that is, two of its singular values are equal and nonzero and the other is zero.  Depending on the application, smaller or larger deviations from the internal constraint may or may not be a problem.  If it is critical that the estimated matrix satisfies the internal constraints, this can be accomplished by finding the matrix &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{E}' &lt;/math&gt; of rank 2 which minimizes

:&lt;math&gt; \| \mathbf{E}' - \mathbf{E}_{\rm est} \| &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{E}_{\rm est} &lt;/math&gt; is the resulting matrix from Step 2 and the [[Matrix norm#Frobenius norm|Frobenius matrix norm]] is used.  The solution to the problem is given by first computing a [[singular value decomposition]] of &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{E}_{\rm est} &lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{E}_{\rm est} = \mathbf{U} \, \mathbf{S} \, \mathbf{V}^{T} &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{U}, \mathbf{V} &lt;/math&gt; are orthogonal matrices and &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{S} &lt;/math&gt; is a diagonal matrix which contains the singular values of &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{E}_{\rm est} &lt;/math&gt;.  In the ideal case, one of the diagonal elements of &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{S} &lt;/math&gt; should be zero, or at least small compared to the other two which should be equal.  In any case, set

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{S}' = \begin{pmatrix} s_1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; s_2 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \end{pmatrix} ,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; s_1, s_2 &lt;/math&gt; are the largest and second largest singular values in &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{S} &lt;/math&gt; respectively. Finally, &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{E}' &lt;/math&gt; is given by

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{E}' = \mathbf{U} \, \mathbf{S}' \, \mathbf{V}^{T} &lt;/math&gt;

The matrix &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{E}' &lt;/math&gt; is the resulting estimate of the essential matrix provided by the algorithm.

== Determining R and t from E ==
This topic is covered in the page on the [[Essential matrix]] [[Essential matrix#Determining R and t from E|(section on determining R and t from E)]].

== The normalized eight-point algorithm ==

The basic eight-point algorithm can in principle be used also for estimating the fundamental matrix &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{F} &lt;/math&gt;.  The defining constraint for &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{F} &lt;/math&gt; is

:&lt;math&gt; (\mathbf{y}')^{T} \, \mathbf{F} \, \mathbf{y} = 0&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{y}, \mathbf{y}' &lt;/math&gt; are the homogeneous representations of corresponding image coordinates (not necessary normalized).  This means that it is possible to form a matrix &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{Y} &lt;/math&gt; in a similar way as for the essential matrix and solve the equation

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{f}^{T} \, \mathbf{Y} = \mathbf{0} &lt;/math&gt;

for &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{f} &lt;/math&gt; which is a reshaped version of &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{F} &lt;/math&gt;.  By following the procedure outlined above, it is then possible to determine &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{F} &lt;/math&gt; from a set of eight matching points.  In practice, however, the resulting fundamental matrix may not be useful for determining epipolar constraints.

=== The problem ===

The problem is that the resulting &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{Y} &lt;/math&gt; often is [[ill-conditioned]].  In theory, &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{Y} &lt;/math&gt; should have one singular value equal to zero and the rest are non-zero.  In practice, however, some of the non-zero singular values can become small relative to the larger ones.  If more than eight corresponding points are used to construct &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{Y} &lt;/math&gt;, where the coordinates are only approximately correct, there may not be a well-defined singular value which can be identified as approximately zero.  Consequently, the solution of the homogeneous linear system of equations may not be sufficiently accurate to be useful.

=== What's causing the problem ===

Hartley addressed this estimation problem in his 1997 article.  His analysis of the problem shows that the problem is caused by the poor distribution of the homogeneous image coordinates in their space, &lt;math&gt; \mathbb{R}^{3} &lt;/math&gt;.  A typical homogeneous representation of the 2D image coordinate &lt;math&gt; (y_{1}, y_{2}) \, &lt;/math&gt; is

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{y} = \begin{pmatrix} y_{1} \\ y_{2} \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;

where both &lt;math&gt; y_{1}, y_{2} \, &lt;/math&gt; lie in the range 0 to 1000-2000 for a modern digital camera.  This means that the first two coordinates in &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{y} &lt;/math&gt; vary over a much larger range than the third coordinate.  Furthermore, if the image points which are used to construct &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{Y} &lt;/math&gt; lie in a relatively small region of the image, for example at &lt;math&gt; (700,700) \pm (100,100) \, &lt;/math&gt;, again the vector &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{y} &lt;/math&gt; points in more or less the same direction for all points.  As a consequence, &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{Y} &lt;/math&gt; will have one large singular value and the remaining are small.

=== How it can be solved ===

As a solution to this problem, Hartley proposed that the coordinate system of each of the two images should be transformed, independently, into a new coordinate system according to the following principle.

* The origin of the new coordinate system should be centered (have its origin) at the centroid (center of gravity) of the image points.  This is accomplished by a translation of the original origin to the new one.
* After the translation the coordinates are uniformly scaled so that the mean distance from the origin to a point equals &lt;math&gt; \sqrt{2} &lt;/math&gt;.

This principle results, normally, in a distinct coordinate transformation for each of the two images.  As a result, new homogeneous image coordinates &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{\bar y}, \mathbf{\bar y}' &lt;/math&gt; are given by

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{\bar y} = \mathbf{T} \, \mathbf{y} &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{\bar y}' = \mathbf{T}' \, \mathbf{y}' &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{T}, \mathbf{T}' &lt;/math&gt; are the transformations (translation and scaling) from the old to the new ''normalized image coordinates''.  This normalization is only dependent on the image points which are used in a single image and is, in general, distinct from normalized image coordinates produced by a normalized camera.

The epipolar constraint based on the fundamental matrix can now be rewritten as

:&lt;math&gt; 0 = (\mathbf{\bar y}')^{T} \, ((\mathbf{T}')^{T})^{-1} \, \mathbf{F} \, \mathbf{T}^{-1}\, \mathbf{\bar y} = (\mathbf{\bar y}')^{T} \, \mathbf{\bar F} \, \mathbf{\bar y} &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{\bar F} = ((\mathbf{T}')^{T})^{-1} \, \mathbf{F} \, \mathbf{T}^{-1} &lt;/math&gt;.  This means that it is possible to use the normalized homogeneous image coordinates &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{\bar y}, \mathbf{\bar y}' &lt;/math&gt; to estimate the transformed fundamental matrix &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{\bar F} &lt;/math&gt; using the basic eight-point algorithm described above.

The purpose of the normalization transformations is that the matrix &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{\bar Y} &lt;/math&gt;, constructed from the normalized image coordinates, in general has a better condition number than &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{Y} &lt;/math&gt; has.  This means that the solution &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{\bar f} &lt;/math&gt; is more well-defined as a solution of the homogeneous equation &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{\bar Y} \, \mathbf{\bar f} &lt;/math&gt; than &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{f} &lt;/math&gt; is relative to &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{Y} &lt;/math&gt;.  Once &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{\bar f} &lt;/math&gt; has been determined and reshaped into &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{\bar F} &lt;/math&gt; the latter can be ''de-normalized'' to give &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{F} &lt;/math&gt; according to

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{F} = (\mathbf{T}')^{T} \, \mathbf{\bar F} \, \mathbf{T} &lt;/math&gt;

In general, this estimate of the fundamental matrix is a better one than would have been obtained by estimating from the un-normalized coordinates.

== Using fewer than eight points ==

Each point pair contributes with one constraining equation on the element in &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{E} &lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{E} &lt;/math&gt; has five degrees of freedom it should therefore be sufficient with only five point pairs to determine &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{E} &lt;/math&gt;. Though possible from a theoretical point of view, the practical implementation of this is not straightforward and relies on solving various non-linear equations.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4876">[[David Hilbert|Hilbert]]'s '''epsilon calculus''' is an extension of a [[formal language]] by the epsilon operator, where the epsilon operator substitutes for [[Quantification (logic)|quantifiers]] in that language as a method leading to a [[consistency proof|proof of consistency]] for the extended formal language.  The ''epsilon operator'' and ''epsilon substitution method'' are typically applied to a [[first-order logic|first-order predicate calculus]], followed by a showing of consistency. The epsilon-extended calculus is further extended and generalized to cover those mathematical objects, classes, and categories for which there is a desire to show consistency, building on previously-shown consistency at earlier levels.&lt;ref&gt;Stanford, overview paragraphs&lt;/ref&gt;

==Epsilon operator==

===Hilbert notation===
For any formal language ''L'', extend ''L'' by adding the epsilon operator to redefine quantification:

*&lt;math&gt; (\exists x) A(x)\ \equiv \ A(\epsilon x\ A) &lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt; (\forall x) A(x)\ \equiv \ A(\epsilon x\ (\neg A)) &lt;/math&gt;

The intended interpretation of ε''x'' ''A'' is ''some x'' that satisfies ''A'', if it exists.  In other words, ε''x'' ''A'' returns some term ''t'' such that ''A''(''t'') is true, otherwise it returns some default or arbitrary term.  If more than one term can satisfy ''A'', then any one of these terms (which make ''A'' true) can be [[Axiom of Choice|chosen]], non-deterministically.  Equality is required to be defined under ''L'', and the only rules required for ''L'' extended by the epsilon operator are modus ponens and the substitution of ''A''(''t'') to replace ''A''(''x'') for any term ''t''.&lt;ref&gt;Stanford, the epsilon calculus paragraphs&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bourbaki notation===
In tau-square notation from [[Nicolas Bourbaki|N. Bourbaki's]] ''Theory of Sets'', the quantifiers are defined as follows:

*&lt;math&gt; (\exists x) A(x)\ \equiv \ (\tau_x(A)|x)A &lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt; (\forall x) A(x)\ \equiv \ \neg (\tau_x(\neg A)|x)\neg A\ \equiv \ (\tau_x(\neg A)|x)A&lt;/math&gt;

where ''A'' is a relation in ''L'', ''x'' is a variable, and &lt;math&gt;\tau_x(A)&lt;/math&gt; juxtaposes a &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; at the front of ''A'', replaces all instances of ''x'' with &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;, and links them back to &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;.  Then let ''Y'' be an assembly, ''(Y|x)A'' denotes the replacement of all variables ''x'' in ''A'' with ''Y''.

This notation is equivalent to the Hilbert notation and is read the same. It is used by Bourbaki to define [[cardinal assignment]] since he does not use the [[axiom of replacement]].

Defining quantifiers in this way leads to great inefficiencies. For instance, the expansion of Bourbaki's original definition of the number one, using this notation, has length approximately 4.5&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;, and for a later edition of Bourbaki that combined this notation with the Kuratowski definition of [[ordered pair]]s, this number grows to approximately 2.4&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;54&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

==Modern approaches==

[[Hilbert's program]] for mathematics was to justify those [[formal system]]s as consistent in relation to constructive or semi-constructive systems. While Gödel's results on incompleteness mooted Hilbert's Program to a great extent, modern researchers find the epsilon calculus to provide alternatives for approaching proofs of systemic consistency as described in the epsilon substitution method.

===Epsilon substitution method===
A theory to be checked for consistency is first embedded in an appropriate epsilon calculus. Second, a process is developed for re-writing quantified theorems to be expressed in terms of epsilon operations via the epsilon substitution method. Finally, the process must be shown to normalize the re-writing process, so that the re-written theorems satisfy the axioms of the theory.&lt;ref&gt;Stanford, more recent developments paragraphs&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8018">'''Finitism''' is a [[philosophy of mathematics]] that accepts the existence only of [[finite set|finite]] [[mathematical object]]s. It is best understood in comparison to the mainstream philosophy of mathematics where infinite mathematical objects (e.g., [[infinite set]]s) are accepted as legitimate.

== Main idea ==
The main idea of finitistic mathematics is not accepting the existence of infinite objects such as infinite sets. While all natural numbers are accepted as existing, the set of all natural numbers is not considered to exist as a mathematical object. Therefore [[quantifier (logic)|quantification]] over infinite domains is not considered meaningful. The mathematical theory often associated with finitism is [[Thoralf Skolem]]'s [[primitive recursive arithmetic]].

== History ==
The introduction of infinite mathematical objects occurred a few centuries ago when the use of infinite objects was already a controversial topic among mathematicians. The issue entered a new phase when [[Georg Cantor]] in 1874 introduced what is now called [[naive set theory]] and used it as a base for his work on [[transfinite numbers]]. When paradoxes such as [[Russell's paradox]], [[Berry's paradox]] and the [[Burali-Forti paradox]] were discovered in Cantor's naive set theory, the issue became a heated topic among mathematicians.

There were various positions taken by mathematicians. All agreed about finite mathematical objects such as natural numbers. However there were disagreements regarding infinite mathematical objects. 
One position was the [[intuitionistic mathematics]] that was advocated by [[L. E. J. Brouwer]], which rejected the existence of infinite objects until they are constructed.

Another position was endorsed by [[David Hilbert]]: finite mathematical objects are concrete objects, infinite mathematical objects are ideal objects, and accepting ideal mathematical objects does not cause a problem regarding finite mathematical objects. More formally, Hilbert believed that it is possible to show that any theorem about finite mathematical objects that can be obtained using ideal infinite objects can be also obtained without them. Therefore allowing infinite mathematical objects would not cause a problem regarding finite objects. This led to [[Hilbert's program]] of proving consistency of set theory using finitistic means as this would imply that adding ideal mathematical objects is conservative over the finitistic part. Hilbert's views are also associated with [[Formalism (mathematics)|formalist philosophy of mathematics]]. Hilbert's goal of proving the consistency of set theory or even arithmetic through finitistic means turned out to be an impossible task due to [[Kurt Gödel]]'s [[incompleteness theorems]]. However, by [[Harvey Friedman]]'s [[Elementary function arithmetic#Friedman.27s grand conjecture|grand conjecture]] most mathematical results should be provable using finitistic means.

Hilbert did not give a rigorous explanation of what he considered finitistic and refer to as elementary. However, based on his work with [[Paul Bernays]] some experts such as [[William W. Tait|William Tait]] have argued that the [[primitive recursive arithmetic]] can be considered an upper bound on what Hilbert considered finitistic mathematics.

In the years following Gödel's theorems, as it became clear that there is no hope of proving consistency of mathematics, and with development of [[axiomatic set theory|axiomatic set theories]] such as [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]] and the lack of any evidence against its consistency, most mathematicians lost interest in the topic. Today most classical mathematicians are considered [[Platonist]] and readily use infinite mathematical objects and a set-theoretical universe.{{cn|date=July 2014}}

== Classical finitism vs. strict finitism ==
In her book ''Philosophy of Set Theory'', [[Mary Tiles]] characterized those who allow ''potentially infinite'' objects as '''classical finitists''', and those who do not allow potentially infinite objects as '''strict finitists''': for example, a classical finitist would allow statements such as "every natural number has a [[successor function|successor]]" and would accept the meaningfulness of infinite [[series (mathematics)|series]] in the sense of limits of finite partial sums, while a strict finitist would not. Historically, the [[recorded history|written history]] of mathematics was thus classically finitist until Cantor discovered the hierarchy of [[transfinite number|transfinite]] [[cardinal number|cardinals]] at the end of the 19th century.

== Views regarding infinite mathematical objects ==
[[Leopold Kronecker]] remained a strident opponent to Cantor's set theory:&lt;ref&gt;Eriksson, K., Estep D., and Johnson C. ''Applied Mathematics: Body and Soul''. Volume 1. Springer, 2004, p. 230-232.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote
|God created the natural numbers; all else is the work of man.&lt;ref&gt;
From an 1886 lecture at the  'Berliner Naturforscher-Versammlung', according to [[H. M. Weber]]'s memorial article, [http://gdz.sub.uni-goettingen.de/dms/load/img/?PPN=PPN37721857X_0002&amp;DMDID=dmdlog6 ''Leopold Kronecker'', in Jahresbericht der Deutschen Mathematiker-Vereinigung, Vol. 2 1891-92]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Reuben Goodstein]] is another proponent of finitism.  Some of his work involved building up to [[Mathematical analysis|analysis]] from finitist foundations.

Although he denied it, much of [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]'s writing on mathematics has a strong affinity with finitism.

If finitists are contrasted with [[Transfinite number|transfinitists]] (proponents of e.g. [[Georg Cantor]]'s hierarchy of infinities), then also [[Aristotle]] may be characterized as a strict finitist. Aristotle especially promoted the [[potential infinity]] as a middle option between strict finitism and [[actual infinity]] (the latter being an actualization of something never-ending in nature, in contrast with the Cantorist actual infinity consisting of the transfinite [[cardinal number|cardinal]] and [[ordinal number|ordinal]] numbers, which have nothing to do with the things in nature):

{{quote
|But on the other hand to suppose that the infinite does not exist in any way leads obviously to many impossible consequences: there will be a beginning and end of time, a magnitude will not be divisible into magnitudes, number will not be infinite. If, then, in view of the above considerations, neither alternative seems possible, an arbiter must be called in.
|Aristotle, Physics, Book 3, Chapter 6}}

== Other related philosophies of mathematics ==
'''[[Ultrafinitism]]''' (also known as '''ultraintuitionism''') has an even more conservative attitude towards mathematical objects than finitism, and has objections to the existence of finite mathematical objects when they are too large.

Towards the end of the 20th century [[John Penn Mayberry]] developed a system of finitary mathematics which he called "Euclidean Arithmetic". The most striking tenet of his system is a complete and rigorous rejection of the special foundational status normally accorded to iterative processes, including in particular the construction of the natural numbers by the iteration "+1". Consequently Mayberry is in sharp dissent from those who would seek to equate finitary mathematics with Peano Arithmetic or any of its fragments such as [[primitive recursive arithmetic]].

'''George Peacock''' [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]] (9 April 1791 – 8 November 1858) was an English [[mathematician]].

==Early life==
Peacock was born on 9 April 1791 at [[Thornton Hall, High Coniscliffe|Thornton Hall]], Denton, near [[Darlington]], County Durham.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey W. Becher, ‘Peacock, George (1791–1858)’, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, May 2009 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/21673, accessed 2 May 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; His father, Thomas Peacock, was a priest of the [[Church of England]], incumbent and for 50 years curate of the parish of Denton, where he also kept a school. In early life Peacock did not show any precocity of genius, and was more remarkable for daring feats of climbing than for any special attachment to study. Initially, he received his elementary education from his father and then at [[Sedbergh School]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.books.google.ca/books?id=_BMOAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq |title=The Sedbergh School Register (1546-1895) }}{{dead link|date=January 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and at 17 years of age, he was sent to [[Richmond School]] under [[James Tate (headmaster)|James Tate]], a graduate of [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]]. At this school he distinguished himself greatly both in classics and in the rather elementary mathematics then required for entrance at Cambridge. In 1809 he became a student of [[Trinity College, Cambridge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=PCK809G|name=Peacock, George}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1812 Peacock took the rank of [[Second Wrangler]], and the second [[Smith's prize]], the senior wrangler being [[John Herschel]]. Two years later he became a candidate for a fellowship in his college and won it immediately, partly by means of his extensive and accurate knowledge of the classics. A fellowship then meant about pounds 200 a year, tenable for seven years provided the Fellow did not marry meanwhile, and capable of being extended after the seven years provided the Fellow took clerical orders, which Peacock did in 1819.

==Mathematical career==
The year after taking a Fellowship, Peacock was appointed a tutor and lecturer of his college, which position he continued to hold for many years. Peacock, in common with many other students of his own standing, was profoundly impressed with the need of reforming Cambridge's position ignoring the differential notation for calculus, and while still an undergraduate formed a league with [[Charles Babbage|Babbage]] and [[John Herschel|Herschel]] to adopt measures to bring it about. In 1815 they formed what they called the ''Analytical Society'', the object of which was stated to be to advocate the ''d'' 'ism of the Continent versus the ''dot''-age of the University.

The first movement on the part of the [[Analytical Society]] was to translate from the French the smaller work of [[Sylvestre François Lacroix|Lacroix]] on the differential and integral calculus; it was published in 1816.&lt;ref&gt;G. Peacock (translator)(1816) [https://archive.org/details/anelementarytre00babbgoog An Elementary Treatise on the Differential and Integral Calculus] by [[Sylvestre Lacroix]], link from [[Internet Archive]]&lt;/ref&gt; At that time the [[French language]] had the best manuals, as well as the greatest works on mathematics. Peacock followed up the translation with a volume containing a copious ''Collection of Examples of the Application of the Differential and Integral Calculus'', which was published in 1820.&lt;ref&gt;G. Peacock (1820) [https://books.google.ca/books?id=2f43AAAAMAAJ Collection of Examples of the Application of the Differential and Integral Calculus], link from [[Google Books]]&lt;/ref&gt; The sale of both books was rapid, and contributed materially to further the object of the Society. In that time, high wranglers of one year became the examiners of the mathematical tripos three or four years afterwards. Peacock was appointed an examiner in 1817, and he did not fail to make use of the position as a powerful lever to advance the cause of reform. In his questions set for the examination the differential notation was for the first time officially employed in Cambridge. The innovation did not escape censure, but he wrote to a friend as follows: "I assure you that I shall never cease to exert myself to the utmost in the cause of reform, and that I will never decline any office which may increase my power to effect it. I am nearly certain of being nominated to the office of Moderator in the year 1818-1819, and as I am an examiner in virtue of my office, for the next year I shall pursue a course even more decided than hitherto, since I shall feel that men have been prepared for the change, and will then be enabled to have acquired a better system by the publication of improved elementary books. I have considerable influence as a lecturer, and I will not neglect it. It is by silent perseverance only, that we can hope to reduce the many-headed monster of prejudice and make the University answer her character as the loving mother of good learning and science." These few sentences give an insight into the character of Peacock: he was an ardent reformer and a few years brought success to the cause of the Analytical Society.

Another reform at which Peacock labored was the teaching of [[algebra]]. In 1830 he published a ''Treatise on Algebra'' which had for its object the placing of algebra on a true scientific basis, adequate for the development which it had received at the hands of the Continental mathematicians.  To elevate astronomical science the Astronomical Society of London was founded, and the three reformers Peacock, Babbage and Herschel were again prime movers in the undertaking. Peacock was one of the most zealous promoters of an astronomical observatory at Cambridge, and one of the founders of the Philosophical Society of Cambridge.

In 1831 the British Association for the Advancement of Science (prototype of the American, French and Australasian Associations) held its first meeting in the ancient city of [[York]].  One of the first resolutions adopted was to procure reports on the state and progress of particular sciences, to be drawn up from time to time by competent persons for the information of the annual meetings, and the first to be placed on the list was a report on the progress of mathematical science. Whewell, the mathematician and philosopher, was a Vice-president of the meeting: he was instructed to select the reporter. He first asked [[William Rowan Hamilton]], who declined; he then asked Peacock, who accepted. Peacock had his report ready for the third meeting of the Association, which was held in Cambridge in 1833; although limited to [[Algebra]], [[Trigonometry]], and the Arithmetic of Sines, it is one of the best of the long series of valuable reports which have been prepared for and printed by the Association.

In 1837 Peacock was appointed [[Lowndean Professor of Astronomy]] in the University of Cambridge, the chair afterwards occupied by [[John Couch Adams|Adams]], the co-discoverer of [[Neptune]], and later occupied by [[Robert Stawell Ball|Robert Ball]], celebrated for his ''Theory of Screws''. An object of reform was the statutes of the University; he worked hard at it and was made a member of a commission appointed by the Government for the purpose.

He was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] in January 1818.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://royalsociety.org/DServe/dserve.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&amp;dsqApp=Archive&amp;dsqCmd=Show.tcl&amp;dsqDb=Persons&amp;dsqPos=5&amp;dsqSearch=%28%28text%29%3D%27peacock%27%29|title=Library Archive|publisher=The Royal Society|accessdate=28 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Clerical career==

He was ordained as a deacon in 1819, a priest in 1822 and appointed Vicar of [[Wymeswold]] in Leicestershire in 1826 (until 1835).&lt;ref&gt;{{CCEd |type=person |id=53533 |name=Peacock, George |year1=1819 |year2=1835) |accessed=6 October 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1839 he was appointed [[Dean of Ely]] cathedral, Cambridgeshire, a position he held for the rest of his life, some 20 years. Together with the architect [[George Gilbert Scott]] he undertook a major restoration of the cathedral building. This included the installation of the boarded ceiling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.elycathedral.org/history/the_story_cathedral.html| title = The Story of Ely Cathedral History &amp; Heritage| accessdate = 2012-08-29| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120826163145/http://www.elycathedral.org/history/the_story_cathedral.html| archivedate = 26 August 2012| df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While holding this position he wrote a text book on algebra in two volumes, the one called ''Arithmetical Algebra'', and the other ''Symbolical Algebra''.

==Private life==
Politically he was a [[Whig (British political party)|Whig]].&lt;ref&gt;Radicals, Whigs and Conservatives: The Middle and Lower Classes in the Analytical Revolution at Cambridge in the Age of Aristocracy&lt;/ref&gt;

His last public act was to attend a meeting of the university reform commission. He died in Ely on 8 November 1858 in the 68th year of his age  and was buried in Ely cemetery. He had married Frances Elizabeth, the daughter of [[William Selwyn (QC)|William Selwyn]], but had no children.

==Algebraic theory==

Peacock's main contribution to mathematical analysis is his attempt to place algebra on a strictly logical basis. He founded what has been called the philological or symbolical school of mathematicians; to which [[Duncan Farquharson Gregory|Gregory]], [[Augustus De Morgan|De Morgan]] and [[George Boole|Boole]] belonged. His answer to Maseres and Frend was that the science of algebra consisted of two parts—arithmetical algebra and symbolical algebra—and that they erred in restricting the science to the arithmetical part. His view of arithmetical algebra is as follows: "In arithmetical algebra we consider symbols as representing numbers, and the operations to which they are submitted as included in the same definitions as in common arithmetic; the signs &lt;math&gt;+&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;-&lt;/math&gt; denote the operations of addition and subtraction in their ordinary meaning only, and those operations are considered as impossible in all cases where the symbols subjected to them possess values which would render them so in case they were replaced by digital numbers; thus in expressions such as &lt;math&gt;a + b&lt;/math&gt; we must suppose &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; to be quantities of the same kind; in others, like &lt;math&gt;a - b&lt;/math&gt;, we must suppose &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; greater than &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; and therefore homogeneous with it; in products and quotients, like &lt;math&gt;ab&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\frac{a}{b}&lt;/math&gt; we must suppose the multiplier and divisor to be abstract numbers; all results whatsoever, including negative quantities, which are not strictly deducible as legitimate conclusions from the definitions of the several operations must be rejected as impossible, or as foreign to the science.''

Peacock's principle may be stated thus: the elementary symbol of arithmetical algebra denotes a [[Digital data|digital]], i.e., an integer number; and every combination of elementary symbols must reduce to a digital number, otherwise it is impossible or foreign to the science. If &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; are numbers, then &lt;math&gt;a + b&lt;/math&gt; is always a number; but &lt;math&gt;a - b&lt;/math&gt; is a number only when &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; is less than &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;.  Again, under the same conditions, &lt;math&gt;ab&lt;/math&gt; is always a number, but &lt;math&gt;\frac{a}{b}&lt;/math&gt; is really a number only when &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; is an exact divisor of &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;. Hence the following dilemma: Either &lt;math&gt;\frac{a}{b}&lt;/math&gt; must be held to be an impossible expression in general, or else the meaning of the fundamental symbol of algebra must be extended so as to include rational fractions. If the former horn of the dilemma is chosen, arithmetical algebra becomes a mere shadow; if the latter horn is chosen, the operations of algebra cannot be defined on the supposition that the elementary symbol is an integer number. Peacock attempts to get out of the difficulty by supposing that a symbol which is used as a multiplier is always an integer number, but that a symbol in the place of the multiplicand may be a fraction. For instance, in &lt;math&gt;ab&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; can denote only an integer number, but &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; may denote a rational fraction. Now there is no more fundamental principle in arithmetical algebra than that &lt;math&gt;ab = ba&lt;/math&gt;; which would be illegitimate on Peacock's principle.

One of the earliest English writers on [[arithmetic]] is [[Robert Record]], who dedicated his work to King Edward the Sixth. The author gives his treatise the form of a dialogue between master and scholar. The scholar battles long over this difficulty, -- that multiplying a thing could make it less. The master attempts to explain the anomaly by reference to proportion; that the product due to a fraction bears the same proportion to the thing multiplied that the fraction bears to unity. But the scholar is not satisfied and the master goes on to say: "If I multiply by more than one, the thing is increased; if I take it but once, it is not changed, and if I take it less than once, it cannot be so much as it was before. Then seeing that a fraction is less than one, if I multiply by a fraction, it follows that I do take it less than once." Whereupon the scholar replies, "Sir, I do thank you much for this reason, -- and I trust that I do perceive the thing."

The fact is that even in arithmetic the two processes of [[multiplication]] and [[division (mathematics)|division]] are generalized into a common multiplication; and the difficulty consists in passing from the original idea of multiplication to the generalized idea of a ''[[tensor]]'', which idea includes compressing the [[magnitude (mathematics)|magnitude]] as well as stretching it. Let &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; denote an integer number; the next step is to gain the idea of the [[Multiplicative inverse|reciprocal]] of &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;, not as &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{m}&lt;/math&gt; but simply as &lt;math&gt;/m&lt;/math&gt;. When &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;/n&lt;/math&gt; are compounded we get the idea of a rational fraction; for in general &lt;math&gt;m/n&lt;/math&gt; will not reduce to a number nor to the reciprocal of a number.

Suppose, however, that we pass over this objection; how does Peacock lay the foundation for general algebra? He calls it symbolical algebra, and he passes from arithmetical algebra to symbolical algebra in the following manner: "Symbolical algebra adopts the rules of arithmetical algebra but removes altogether their restrictions; thus symbolical subtraction differs from the same operation in arithmetical algebra in being possible for all relations of value of the symbols or expressions employed. All the results of arithmetical algebra which are deduced by the application of its rules, and which are general in form though particular in value, are results likewise of symbolical algebra where they are general in value as well as in form; thus the product of &lt;math&gt;a^{m}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;a^{n}&lt;/math&gt; which is &lt;math&gt;a^{m+n}&lt;/math&gt; when &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; are whole numbers and therefore general in form though particular in value, will be their product likewise when &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; are general in value as well as in form; the series for &lt;math&gt;(a+b)^{n}&lt;/math&gt; determined by the principles of arithmetical algebra when &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is any whole number, ''if it be exhibited in a general form, without reference to a final term'', may be shown upon the same principle to the equivalent series for &lt;math&gt;(a+b)^n&lt;/math&gt; when &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is general both in form and value."

The principle here indicated by means of examples was named by Peacock the "principle of the permanence of equivalent forms," and at page 59 of the ''Symbolical Algebra'' it is thus enunciated: "Whatever algebraic forms are equivalent when the symbols are general in form, but specific in value, will be equivalent likewise when the symbols are general in value as well as in form."

For example, let &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; denote any integer numbers, but subject to the restrictions that &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; is less than &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; less than &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;; it may then be shown arithmetically that &lt;math&gt;(a - b)(c - d)=ac + bd - ad - bc&lt;/math&gt;.  Peacock's principle says that the form on the left side is equivalent to the form on the right side, not only when the said restrictions of being less are removed, but when &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; denote the most general algebraic symbol. It means that &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; may be rational fractions, or surds, or imaginary quantities, or indeed [[Operator (mathematics)|operators]] such as &lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx}&lt;/math&gt;. The [[Equivalence relation|equivalence]] is not established by means of the nature of the [[quantity]] denoted; the equivalence is assumed to be true, and then it is attempted to find the different interpretations which may be put on the symbol.

It is not difficult to see that the problem before us involves the fundamental problem of a rational logic or theory of knowledge; namely, how are we able to ascend from particular truths to more general truths. If &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; denote integer numbers, of which &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; is less than &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; less than &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;(a - b)(c - d)=ac + bd - ad - bc&lt;/math&gt;.

It is first seen that the above restrictions may be removed, and still the above equation holds. But the antecedent is still too narrow; the true scientific problem consists in specifying the meaning of the symbols, which, and only which, will admit of the forms being equal. It is not to find "some meanings", but the "most general meaning", which allows the equivalence to be true. Let us examine some other cases; we shall find that Peacock's principle is not a solution of the difficulty; the great logical process of generalization cannot be reduced to any such easy and arbitrary procedure. When &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; denote integer numbers, it can be shown that&lt;math&gt;a^{m}a^{n} = a^{m+n}&lt;/math&gt;.

According to Peacock the form on the left is always to be equal to the form on the right, and the meanings of &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; are to be found by interpretation. Suppose that &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; takes the form of the incommensurate quantity &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt;, the base of the natural system of [[logarithm]]s. A number is a degraded form of a complex quantity &lt;math&gt;p+q^{\sqrt{-1}}&lt;/math&gt; and a complex quantity is a degraded form of a [[quaternion]]; consequently one meaning which may be assigned to &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is that of quaternion. Peacock's principle would lead us to suppose that &lt;math&gt;e^{m}e^{n} = e^{m+n}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; denoting quaternions; but that is just what [[William Rowan Hamilton|W.R. Hamilton]], the inventor of the quaternion generalization, denies. There are reasons for believing that he was mistaken, and that the forms remain equivalent even under that extreme generalization of &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;; but the point is this: it is not a question of conventional definition and formal truth; it is a question of objective definition and real truth.  Let the symbols have the prescribed meaning, does or does not the equivalence still hold? And if it does not hold, what is the higher or more complex form which the equivalence assumes? Or does such equivalence form even exist?

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1222">In [[category theory]], a branch of mathematics, a '''globular set''' is a higher-dimensional generalization of a [[directed graph]]. Precisely, it is a sequence of sets &lt;math&gt;X_0, X_1, X_2, \dots&lt;/math&gt; equipped with pairs of functions &lt;math&gt;s_n, t_n: X_n \to X_{n-1}&lt;/math&gt; such that
* &lt;math&gt;s_n \circ s_{n+1} = s_n \circ t_{n+1},&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;t_n \circ s_{n+1} = t_n \circ t_{n+1}.&lt;/math&gt;
(Equivalently, it is a presheaf on the category of “globes”.) The letters "''s''", "''t''" stand for "source" and "target" and one imagines &lt;math&gt;X_n&lt;/math&gt; consists of directed edges at level&amp;nbsp;''n''.

A variant of the notion was used by [[Grothendieck]] to introduce the notion of an [[∞-groupoid]]. Extending Grothendieck's work, {{harv|Maltsiniotis|2010}} gave a definition of a [[weak ∞-category]] in terms of globular sets.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9698">In [[mathematics]], the '''Hardy–Littlewood maximal operator''' ''M'' is a significant non-linear [[Operation (mathematics)|operator]] used in [[real analysis]] and [[harmonic analysis]]. It takes a [[locally integrable]] function ''f'' : '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''d''&lt;/sup&gt; → '''C''' and returns another function ''Mf'' that, at each point ''x'' ∈ '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''d''&lt;/sup&gt;, gives the maximum [[average|average value]] that ''f'' can have on balls centered at that point. More precisely,

:&lt;math&gt; Mf(x)=\sup_{r&gt;0} \frac{1}{|B(x, r)|}\int_{B(x, r)} |f(y)|\, dy &lt;/math&gt;

where ''B''(''x'', ''r'')  is the ball of radius ''r'' centred at ''x'', and |''E''| denotes the [[Lebesgue measure|''d''-dimensional Lebesgue measure]] of ''E'' ⊂ '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''d''&lt;/sup&gt;.

The averages are jointly [[Continuous function|continuous]] in ''x'' and ''r'', therefore the maximal function ''Mf'', being the supremum over ''r''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0, is [[Measurable function|measurable]]. It is not obvious that ''Mf'' is finite almost everywhere. This is a corollary of the '''Hardy–Littlewood maximal inequality'''

==Hardy–Littlewood maximal inequality==
This theorem of [[G. H. Hardy]] and [[J. E. Littlewood]] states that ''M'' is [[bounded operator|bounded]] as a [[sublinear operator]] from the [[Lp space|''L&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;''('''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''d''&lt;/sup&gt;)]] to itself for ''p'' &gt; 1. That is, if ''f'' ∈ ''L&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;''('''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''d''&lt;/sup&gt;) then the maximal function ''Mf'' is weak ''L''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;-bounded and ''Mf'' ∈ ''L&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;''('''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''d''&lt;/sup&gt;). Before stating the theorem more precisely, for simplicity, let {''f'' &gt; ''t''} denote the set {''x'' | ''f''(''x'') &gt; ''t''}. Now we have:

&lt;blockquote&gt;'''Theorem (Weak Type Estimate).''' For ''d''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;1 and ''f''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''L''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;('''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''d''&lt;/sup&gt;), there is a constant ''C&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0 such that for all λ&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0, we have:

:&lt;math&gt;\left |\{Mf &gt; \lambda\} \right |&lt; \frac{C_d}{\lambda} \Vert f\Vert_{L^1 (\mathbf{R}^d)}.&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

With the Hardy–Littlewood maximal inequality in hand, the following ''strong-type'' estimate is an immediate consequence of the [[Marcinkiewicz theorem|Marcinkiewicz interpolation theorem]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;'''Theorem (Strong Type Estimate).''' For ''d''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;1, 1&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''p''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;∞, and ''f''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''L&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;''('''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''d''&lt;/sup&gt;),
there is a constant ''C&lt;sub&gt;p,d&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0 such that

:&lt;math&gt; \Vert Mf\Vert_{L^p (\mathbf{R}^d)}\leq C_{p,d}\Vert f\Vert_{L^p(\mathbf{R}^d)}.&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the strong type estimate the best bounds for ''C&lt;sub&gt;p,d&lt;/sub&gt;'' are unknown.&lt;ref name=Tao/&gt; However subsequently [[Elias M. Stein]] used the Calderón-Zygmund method of rotations to prove the following:

&lt;blockquote&gt;'''Theorem (Dimension Independence).''' For 1&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''p''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;∞ one can pick ''C&lt;sub&gt;p,d&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''C&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;'' independent of ''d''.&lt;ref name=Tao&gt;{{cite web|last=Tao|first=Terence|title=Stein’s spherical maximal theorem|url=http://terrytao.wordpress.com/2011/05/21/steins-spherical-maximal-theorem/|work=What's New|accessdate=22 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Stein82&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stein|first=E. M.|title=The development of square functions in the work of A. Zygmund.|journal=Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society |series=New Series|date=S 1982|volume=7|issue=2|pages=359–376}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Proof==
While there are several proofs of this theorem, a common one is given below: For ''p''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;∞, the inequality is trivial (since the average of a function is no larger than its [[essential supremum]]). For 1&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''p''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;∞, first we shall use the following version of the [[Vitali covering lemma]] to prove the weak-type estimate. (See the article for the proof of the lemma.)

&lt;blockquote&gt;'''Lemma.''' Let ''X'' be a separable metric space and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; family of open balls with bounded diameter. Then &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; has a countable subfamily &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}'&lt;/math&gt; consisting of disjoint balls such that
:&lt;math&gt;\bigcup_{B \in \mathcal{F}} B \subset \bigcup_{B \in \mathcal{F'}} 5B&lt;/math&gt;
where 5''B'' is ''B'' with 5 times radius.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

If ''Mf''(''x'') &gt; ''t'', then, by definition, we can find a ball ''B&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'' centered at ''x'' such that
:&lt;math&gt;\int_{B_x} |f|dy &gt; t|B_x|.&lt;/math&gt;
By the lemma, we can find, among such balls, a sequence of disjoint balls ''B&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'' such that the union of 5''B&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'' covers {''Mf'' &gt; ''t''}.
It follows:
:&lt;math&gt;|\{Mf &gt; t\}| \le 5^d \sum_j |B_j| \le {5^d \over t} \int |f|dy.&lt;/math&gt;
This completes the proof of the weak-type estimate. We next deduce from this the ''L&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;'' bounds. Define ''b'' by ''b''(''x'') = ''f''(''x'') if |''f''(''x'')| &gt; ''t''/2 and 0 otherwise. By the weak-type estimate applied to ''b'', we have:
:&lt;math&gt;|\{Mf &gt; t\}| \le {2C \over t} \int_{|f| &gt; \frac{t}{2}} |f|dx, &lt;/math&gt;
with ''C'' = 5&lt;sup&gt;''d''&lt;/sup&gt;. Then
:&lt;math&gt;\|Mf\|_p^p = \int \int_0^{Mf(x)} pt^{p-1} dt dx = p \int_0^\infty t^{p-1} |\{ Mf &gt; t \}|  dt&lt;/math&gt;
By the estimate above we have:
:&lt;math&gt;\|Mf\|_p^p \leq  p \int_0^\infty t^{p-1} \left ({2C \over t} \int_{|f| &gt; \frac{t}{2}} |f|dx \right ) dt = 2C p \int_0^\infty \int_{|f| &gt; \frac{t}{2}} t^{p-2} |f| dx dt = C_p \|f\|_p^p&lt;/math&gt;
where the constant ''C&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;'' depends only on ''p'' and ''d''. This completes the proof of the theorem.

Note that the constant &lt;math&gt;C=5^d&lt;/math&gt; in the proof can be improved to &lt;math&gt;3^d&lt;/math&gt; by using the [[Inner regular measure|inner regularity]] of the [[Lebesgue measure]], and the finite version of the [[Vitali covering lemma#Statement of the lemma|Vitali covering lemma]]. See the [[Hardy-Littlewood maximal function#Discussion|Discussion section]] below for more about optimizing the constant.

==Applications==
Some applications of the Hardy–Littlewood Maximal Inequality include proving the following results:
* [[Lebesgue differentiation theorem]]
* [[Rademacher's theorem|Rademacher differentiation theorem]]
* [[Fatou's theorem]] on nontangential convergence.
* [[Fractional integration theorem]]

Here we use a standard trick involving the maximal function to give a quick proof of Lebesgue differentiation theorem. (But remember that in the proof of the maximal theorem, we used the Vitali covering lemma.) Let ''f'' ∈ ''L''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;('''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;) and

:&lt;math&gt;\Omega f (x) = \limsup_{r \to 0} f_r(x) - \liminf_{r \to 0} f_r(x)&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;f_r(x) = \frac{1}{|B(x, r)|} \int_{B(x, r)} f(y) dy.&lt;/math&gt;

We write ''f'' = ''h'' + ''g'' where ''h'' is continuous and has compact support and ''g'' ∈ ''L''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;('''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;) with norm that can be made arbitrary small. Then

:&lt;math&gt;\Omega f \le \Omega g + \Omega h = \Omega g&lt;/math&gt;

by continuity. Now, Ω''g'' ≤ 2''Mg'' and so, by the theorem, we have:

:&lt;math&gt;\left | \{ \Omega g &gt; \varepsilon \} \right | \le \frac{2A}{\varepsilon} \|g\|_1&lt;/math&gt;

Now, we can let &lt;math&gt;\|g\|_1 \to 0&lt;/math&gt; and conclude Ω''f'' = 0 almost everywhere; that is, &lt;math&gt;\lim_{r \to 0} f_r(x)&lt;/math&gt; exists for almost all ''x''. It remains to show the limit actually equals ''f''(''x''). But this is easy: it is known that &lt;math&gt;\|f_r - f\|_1 \to 0&lt;/math&gt; ([[approximation of the identity]]) and thus there is a subsequence &lt;math&gt;f_{r_k} \to f&lt;/math&gt; almost everywhere. By the uniqueness of limit, ''f&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;'' → ''f'' almost everywhere then.

==Discussion==
It is still unknown what the smallest constants ''C&lt;sub&gt;p,d&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''C&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;'' are in the above inequalities. However, a result of [[Elias Stein]] about spherical maximal functions can be used to show that, for 1&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''p''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;∞, we can remove the dependence of ''C&lt;sub&gt;p,d&lt;/sub&gt;'' on the dimension, that is, ''C&lt;sub&gt;p,d&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''C&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;'' for some constant ''C&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0 only depending on ''p''.  It is unknown whether there is a weak bound that is independent of dimension.

There are several common variants of the Hardy-Littlewood maximal operator which replace the averages over centered balls with averages over different families of sets. For instance, one can define the ''uncentered'' HL maximal operator (using the notation of Stein-Shakarchi)

:&lt;math&gt; f^*(x) = \sup_{x \in B_x} \frac{1}{|B_x|} \int_{B_x} |f(y)| dy&lt;/math&gt;

where the balls ''B&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'' are required to merely contain x, rather than be centered at x. There is also the ''dyadic'' HL maximal operator

:&lt;math&gt;M_\Delta f(x) = \sup_{x \in Q_x} \frac{1}{|Q_x|} \int_{Q_x} |f(y)| dy&lt;/math&gt;

where ''Q&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'' ranges over all [[dyadic cubes]] containing the point ''x''. Both of these operators satisfy the HL maximal inequality.

In [[econometrics]], a '''hedonic index''' is any [[price index]] which uses information from [[hedonic regression]], which describes how product price could be explained by the product's characteristics. Hedonic price indexes have proved to be very useful when applied to calculate price indices for information and communication products (e.g. personal computers) and housing,&lt;ref name="Hill, R. OECD (2011)"&gt;[https://dx.doi.org/10.1787/5kghzxpt6g6f-en Hill, R. “Hedonic Price Indexes for Housing”], OECD Statistics Working Papers , 2011/01, OECD Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; because they can successfully mitigate problems such as those that arise from there being new goods to consider and from rapid changes of quality.

==Motivation==

In the last two decades considerable attention has been drawn to the methods of computing [[price index]]es. The [[Boskin Commission]] in 1996 asserted that there were biases in the price index: traditional matched model indexes can substantially overestimate [[inflation]], because they are not able to measure the impact of peculiarities of specific industries such as fast rotation of goods, huge quality differences among products on the market, and short product life cycle. The Commission showed that the usage of matched model indexes (traditional [[price index]]es) leads to an overestimation of inflation by 0.6% per year in the US official CPI (CPI-U).  [[Information and Communications Technology]] (ICT) products led both to an increase in capital stock and labor productivity growth.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;(Bosworth and Triplett, 2001) What's New About the New Economy? IT, Economic Growth and Productivity [https://econpapers.repec.org/article/slsipmsls/v_3a2_3ay_3a2001_3a3.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; Similar results were obtained by Crawford for Canada,&lt;ref name="Crawford, BoC"&gt;[http://www.bankofcanada.ca/1998/05/boc-review-article/measurement-biases-in-the-canadian-cpi-an-update/ Crawford, Allan, ”Measurement biases in the Canadian CPI: An update?”], English and French, Bank of Canada Review, Spring, 1998, pp. 38-56.&lt;/ref&gt;  by Shiratsuka for Japan,&lt;ref name="Shiratsuka, FRB"&gt;[http://www.chicagofed.org/webpages/publications/working_papers/1999/wp_02.cfm Shiratsuka, Shigenori, ”Measurement errors in Japanese Consumer Price Index”], Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, February 1, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; and by Cunningham for the UK.&lt;ref name="Cunningham,BoE"&gt;[http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/workingpapers/wpabst96.aspx Cunningham, Alastair, ”Measurement Bias in Price Indexes: An Application to the UKs RPI”], Bank of England, Publications, Working Papers, 1996, No. 47.&lt;/ref&gt;  By reversing hedonic methodology, and pending further disclosure from commercial sources, bias has also been enumerated annually over five decades, for the U.S.A.&lt;ref&gt; Farrell C.J. 'Commercial Knowledge On Innovation Economics' A Report, p8 [http://www.techmatt.com/techmatt/Commercial_Knowledge_On_Innovation_Economics_p8.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Quality adjustments are also important for understanding national accounts deflators (see [[GDP deflator]]).  In the USA, for example, growth acceleration after 1995 was driven by the increased investment in ICT products that lead both to an increase in capital stock and labor productivity growth.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;  This increases the complexity of international comparisons of deflators. Wyckoff &lt;ref name="Wyckoff,EINT"&gt;[http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10438599500000007 Wyckoff, Andrew W., ”The Impact of Computer Prices on International Comparisons of Labour Productivity”], Economics of Innovation and New Technology, 1995, Vol. 3 Issue 3-4, pp. 277-93&lt;/ref&gt; and Eurostat&lt;ref&gt;Eurostat Task Force, ”Volume Measures for Computers and Software”, June, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; show that there is a huge dispersion in ICT deflators in [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) and European countries, accordingly.

These differences are so huge that it cannot be explained by any means of market conditions, regulation, etc. As both studies suggest, most of the discrepancy comes from the differences in quality adjustment procedures across countries and that, in turn, makes international comparison of investment in ICT impossible (as it is calculated through deflation). This also makes it difficult to compare the impact of ICT on economies (countries, regions, etc.) that use different methods to compute GDP numbers.

==Hedonic regression==
{{main|Hedonic regression}}

For example, for a linear econometric model, assume that at each period ''t'' we have &lt;math&gt;n_{t}&lt;/math&gt; goods, which could be described by a vector of ''k'' characteristics &lt;math&gt;(z_{1it},...,z_{kit}\;)^T&lt;/math&gt;. Thus the hedonic (cross-sectional) regression is:

:&lt;math&gt;P_{it}=c_{0t}+\sum_{j=1}^{k}c_{it}z_{jit}+\xi_{it} ,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;c_{it}&lt;/math&gt; is a set of coefficients and &lt;math&gt;\xi_{it}&lt;/math&gt; are [[independent and identically distributed]], having a [[normal distribution]] &lt;math&gt;N(0,\sigma^{2})&lt;/math&gt;.

==Hedonic price index==

There are several ways the hedonic price indexes can be constructed. Following Triplett,&lt;ref&gt;Jack Triplett, 2006. ''Handbook on Hedonic Indexes and Quality Adjustments in Price Indexes: Special Application to Information Technology Products''. OECD. [http://www.oecdbookshop.org/oecd/display.asp?sf1=identifiers&amp;st1=9264028153 Description] and [https://books.google.com/books?id=yIa8z0-F9TYC&amp;printsec=find&amp;pg=PA5#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Contents].&lt;/ref&gt; two methods can be distinguished&amp;mdash;direct and indirect. The direct method uses only information obtained from the hedonic regression, while the second method combines information derived from the hedonic regression and matched models (traditional [[price index]]es). In indirect method, data used for estimating hedonic regression and calculating matched models indexes are different.

The ''Direct method'' could be divided into the ''Time Dummy Variable'' and ''Characteristic methods''. 

===Time dummy variable method===
The Time Dummy Variable is simpler, because it assumes implicit prices (coefficients of the hedonic regression - &lt;math&gt;c_{it}&lt;/math&gt;) to be constant over adjacent time periods. This assumption generally does not hold &lt;ref&gt;Berndt, Ernst R. and Neal J. Rappaport (2001), ”Price and Quality of Desktop and Mobile Personal Computers: A Quarter-Century Historical Overview”, American Economic Review, 91(2) (May), pp. 268-273.&lt;/ref&gt; since implicit prices reflect both demand and supply.&lt;ref&gt;Pakes A. (2002), ”A Reconsideration of hedonic price indexes with an application to PC’s”. NBER Working Paper No.8715 (2002), January.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Characteristic method===
Characteristic method, relaxes this assumption, based on the usage of fitted prices from hedonic regression. This method generally should lead to a more stable estimates, because ordinary least squares (OLS) estimates guarantee that the regression always passes through its mean.

The corresponding ''characteristic chain'' hedonic price index looks for period from ''0'' to ''T'',

:&lt;math&gt;\prod_{t=0}^{T}\frac{\widehat{P}_{t+1}(z^{\tau})}{\widehat{P}_{t}(z^{\tau})},&lt;/math&gt;

and &lt;math&gt;\widehat{P}_{t+1}(z^{\tau})&lt;/math&gt; is an estimate of price obtained from hedonic regression at period ''t''+1 with mean characteristics of period &lt;math&gt;\tau: \ z^{\tau}&lt;/math&gt;.

The corresponding ''characteristic base'' hedonic price index looks for period from ''0'' to ''T'':

:&lt;math&gt;HPI(0,T)=\frac{\widehat{P}_{T}(z^{\tau})}{\widehat{P}_{0}(z^{\tau})}.&lt;/math&gt;

A specification of &lt;math&gt;\ z^{\tau}&lt;/math&gt; - mean characteristics for the certain period, determines the type of index. For example, if we set &lt;math&gt;\ z^{\tau}&lt;/math&gt; equal to the mean of the characteristics for the previous period &lt;math&gt;t: \ z^t&lt;/math&gt;, we would get a Laspeyres-type index. Setting &lt;math&gt;\ z^{\tau}&lt;/math&gt; equal to &lt;math&gt;t+1:\ z^{t+1}&lt;/math&gt; gives Paasche-type index and so on. The Fisher-type index is defined as a square root of product of Laspeyres- and Paasche-type indexes. The Edgeworth-Marshall index uses the arithmetic mean of mean characteristics of two periods ''t'' and ''t''+1. A Walsh-type index uses the geometric average of two periods. And finally, the base quality index does not update characteristics (quality) and uses fixed base characteristics - &lt;math&gt;\  z^0&lt;/math&gt;.

==Hedonic quality indexes==

Hedonic quality index is similar to quantity index in traditional index theory—it measures how the price of obtaining set of characteristics had changed over time. For example, if we are willing to estimate the effect that characteristic growth (or decline) has had on the price of a computer for one period - from ''t'' to ''t+1'', then the hedonic quality index would look like:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\widehat{P}_{\eta}(z^{t+1})}{\widehat{P}_{\eta}(z^{t})},&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\ \eta&lt;/math&gt;, as in the case with price indexes, determines the type of the index. So, the chain quality index for the period from ''0'' to ''T'' would look like:

:&lt;math&gt;\prod_{t=0}^{T}\frac{\widehat{P}_{\eta}(z^{t+1})}{\widehat{P}_{\eta}(z^{t})}&lt;/math&gt;

and the base index:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\widehat{P}_{\eta}(z^{T})}{\widehat{P}_{\eta}(z^{0})}.&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9661">:''Not to be confused with [[Uniform distribution (continuous)|uniform distribution]]''
In [[mathematics]], a '''homogeneous distribution''' is a [[distribution (mathematics)|distribution]] ''S'' on [[Euclidean space]] '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; or {{nowrap|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; \ {0}}} that is [[homogeneous function|homogeneous]] in the sense that, roughly speaking,
:&lt;math&gt;S(tx) = t^m S(x)\,&lt;/math&gt;
for all ''t'' &gt; 0.

More precisely, let &lt;math&gt;\mu_t : x\mapsto x/t&lt;/math&gt; be the scalar division operator on '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;.  A distribution ''S'' on '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; or {{nowrap|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; \ {0}}} is homogeneous of degree ''m'' provided that
:&lt;math&gt;S[t^{-n}\varphi\circ\mu_t] = t^mS[\varphi]&lt;/math&gt;
for all positive real ''t'' and all test functions &amp;phi;.  The additional factor of ''t''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; is needed to reproduce the usual notion of homogeneity for locally integrable functions, and comes about from the [[integration by substitution|Jacobian change of variables]].  The number ''m'' can be real or complex.

It can be a non-trivial problem to extend a given homogeneous distribution from '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; \ {0} to a distribution on '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, although this is necessary for many of the techniques of [[Fourier analysis]], in particular the [[Fourier transform]], to be brought to bear.  Such an extension exists in most cases, however, although it may not be unique.

==Properties==
If ''S'' is a homogeneous distribution on '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; \ {0} of degree &amp;alpha;, then the [[weak derivative|weak]] [[partial derivative|first partial derivative]] of ''S''
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial S}{\partial x_i}&lt;/math&gt;
has degree &amp;alpha;&amp;minus;1.  Furthermore, a version of [[Euler's homogeneous function theorem]] holds: a distribution ''S'' is homogeneous of degree &amp;alpha; if and only if
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^n x_i\frac{\partial S}{\partial x_i} = \alpha S.&lt;/math&gt;

==One dimension==
A complete classification of homogeneous distributions in one dimension is possible.  The homogeneous distributions on {{nowrap|'''R''' \ {0}}} are given by various [[power function]]s.  In addition to the power functions, homogeneous distributions on '''R''' include the [[Dirac delta function]] and its derivatives.

The Dirac delta function is homogeneous of degree &amp;minus;1.  Intuitively,
:&lt;math&gt;\int_{\mathbb{R}} \delta(tx)\varphi(x)\,dx = \int_{\mathbb{R}} \delta(y)\varphi(y/t)\,\frac{dy}{t} = t^{-1}\varphi(0)&lt;/math&gt;
by making a change of variables ''y'' = ''tx'' in the "integral".  Moreover, the ''k''th weak derivative of the delta function &amp;delta;&lt;sup&gt;(''k'')&lt;/sup&gt; is homogeneous of degree &amp;minus;''k''&amp;minus;1.  These distributions all have support consisting only of the origin: when localized over {{nowrap|'''R''' \ {0}}}, these distributions are all identically zero.

===''x''{{su|p=&amp;alpha;|b=+}}===
In one dimension, the function
:&lt;math&gt;x_+^\alpha = \begin{cases}x^\alpha&amp;\text{if }x&gt;0\\ 0&amp;\text{otherwise}\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;
is locally integrable on {{nowrap|'''R''' \ {0}}}, and thus defines a distribution.  The distribution is homogeneous of degree &amp;alpha;.  Similarly &lt;math&gt;x_-^\alpha = (-x)_+^\alpha&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;|x|^\alpha = x_+^\alpha + x_-^\alpha&lt;/math&gt; are homogeneous distributions of degree &amp;alpha;.

However, each of these distributions is only locally integrable on all of '''R''' provided Re(&amp;alpha;) &gt; &amp;minus;1.  But although the function &lt;math&gt;x_+^\alpha&lt;/math&gt; naively defined by the above formula fails to be locally integrable for Re &amp;alpha; &amp;le; &amp;minus;1, the mapping
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha\mapsto x_+^\alpha&lt;/math&gt;
is a [[holomorphic function]] from the right half-plane to the [[topological vector space]] of tempered distributions.  It admits a unique [[meromorphic function|meromorphic]] extension with simple poles at each negative integer {{nowrap|1=&amp;alpha; = &amp;minus;1, &amp;minus;2, ...}}.  The resulting extension is homogeneous of degree &amp;alpha;, provided &amp;alpha; is not a negative integer, since on the one hand the relation
:&lt;math&gt;x_+^\alpha[\varphi\circ\mu_t] = t^{\alpha+1}x_+^\alpha[\varphi]&lt;/math&gt;
holds and is holomorphic in &amp;alpha; &gt; 0.  On the other hand, both sides extend meromorphically in &amp;alpha;, and so remain equal throughout the domain of definition.

Throughout the domain of definition, ''x''{{su|p=&amp;alpha;|b=+}} also satisfies the following properties:
* &lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx} x_+^\alpha = \alpha x_+^{\alpha-1}&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;x x_+^\alpha = x_+^{\alpha+1}&lt;/math&gt;

===Other extensions===
There are several distinct ways to extend the definition of power functions to homogeneous distributions on '''R''' at the negative integers.

;&amp;chi;{{su|p=&amp;alpha;|b=+}}

The poles in ''x''{{su|b=+|p=&amp;alpha;}} at the negative integers can be removed by renormalizing.  Put
:&lt;math&gt;\chi_+^\alpha = \frac{x_+^\alpha}{\Gamma(1+\alpha)}.&lt;/math&gt;
This is an [[entire function]] of &amp;alpha;.  At the negative integers,
:&lt;math&gt;\chi_+^{-k} = \delta^{(k-1)}.&lt;/math&gt;
The distributions &lt;math&gt;\chi_+^a&lt;/math&gt; have the properties
* &lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx} \chi_+^\alpha =  \chi_+^{\alpha-1}&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;x \chi_+^\alpha = \alpha\chi_+^{\alpha+1}.&lt;/math&gt;

;&lt;math&gt;\underline{x}^k&lt;/math&gt;

A second approach is to define the distribution &lt;math&gt;\underline{x}^{-k}&lt;/math&gt;, for {{nowrap|1=''k'' = 1, 2, ...,}}
:&lt;math&gt;\underline{x}^{-k} = \frac{(-1)^{k-1}}{(k-1)!}\frac{d^k}{dx^k}\log |x|.&lt;/math&gt;
These clearly retain the original properties of power functions:
* &lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx} \underline{x}^{-k} = -k \underline{x}^{-k-1}&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;x \underline{x}^{-k} = \underline{x}^{-k+1},\quad\text{if }k&gt;1.&lt;/math&gt;
These distributions are also characterized by their action on test functions
:&lt;math&gt;\underline{x}^{-k} = \int_{-\infty}^\infty \frac{\phi(x) - \sum_{j=0}^{k-1}x^j\phi^{(j)}(0)/j!}{x^k}\,dx,&lt;/math&gt;
and so generalize the [[Cauchy principal value]] distribution of 1/''x'' that arises in the [[Hilbert transform]].

;(''x'' ± i0)&lt;sup&gt;&amp;alpha;&lt;/sup&gt;
Another homogeneous distribution is given by the distributional limit
:&lt;math&gt;(x + i0)^\alpha = \lim_{\epsilon\downarrow 0} (x+i\epsilon)^\alpha.&lt;/math&gt;
That is, acting on test functions
:&lt;math&gt;(x + i0)^\alpha[\varphi] = \lim_{\epsilon\downarrow 0} \int_{\mathbb{R}} (x+i\epsilon)^\alpha\varphi(x)\,dx.&lt;/math&gt;
The branch of the logarithm is chosen to be single-valued in the upper half-plane and to agree with the natural log along the positive real axis.  As the limit of entire functions, {{nowrap|(''x'' + i0)&lt;sup&gt;&amp;alpha;&lt;/sup&gt;[&amp;phi;]}} is an entire function of &amp;alpha;.  Similarly,
:&lt;math&gt;(x-i0)^\alpha = \lim_{\epsilon\downarrow 0} (x-i\epsilon)^\alpha&lt;/math&gt;
is also a well-defined distribution for all &amp;alpha;

When Re &amp;alpha; &gt; 0,
:&lt;math&gt;(x\pm i0)^\alpha = x_+^\alpha + e^{\pm i\pi \alpha}x_-^\alpha,&lt;/math&gt;
which then holds by analytic continuation whenever &amp;alpha; is not a negative integer.  By the permanence of functional relations,
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx} (x\pm i0)^\alpha =  \alpha(x\pm i0)^{\alpha-1}.&lt;/math&gt;

At the negative integers, the identity holds (at the level of distributions on '''R''' \ {0})
:&lt;math&gt;(x\pm i0)^{-k}=x_+^{-k} + (-1)^kx_-^{-k}\pm\pi i(-1)^k \frac{\delta^{(k-1)}}{(k-1)!},&lt;/math&gt;
and the singularities cancel to give a well-defined distribution on '''R'''.  The average of the two distributions agrees with &lt;math&gt;\underline{x}^{-k}&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{(x + i0)^{-k}+ (x- i0)^{-k}}{2} = \underline{x}^{-k}.&lt;/math&gt;
The difference of the two distributions is a multiple of the delta function:
:&lt;math&gt;(x + i0)^{-k} - (x- i0)^{-k} = 2\pi i (-1)^k \frac{\delta^{(k-1)}}{(k-1)!},&lt;/math&gt;
which is known as the [[Plemelj]] jump relation.

===Classification===
The following classification theorem holds {{harv|Gel'fand|Shilov|1966|loc=§3.11}}.  Let ''S'' be a distribution homogeneous of degree &amp;alpha; on {{nowrap|'''R''' \ {0}}}.  Then &lt;math&gt;S = a x_+^\alpha + b x_-^\alpha&lt;/math&gt; for some constants ''a'', ''b''.  Any distribution ''S'' on '''R''' homogeneous of degree  {{nowrap|&amp;alpha; ≠ &amp;minus;1, &amp;minus;2, ...}} is of this form as well.  As a result, every homogeneous distribution of degree {{nowrap|&amp;alpha; ≠ &amp;minus;1, &amp;minus;2, ...}} on {{nowrap|'''R''' \ {0}}} extends to '''R'''.

Finally, homogeneous distributions of degree &amp;minus;''k'', a negative integer, on '''R''' are all of the form:
:&lt;math&gt;a\underline{x}^{-k} + b\delta^{(k-1)}.&lt;/math&gt;

==Higher dimensions==
Homogeneous distributions on the Euclidean space {{nowrap|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; \ {0}}} with the origin deleted are always of the form
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;S(x) = f(x/|x|)|x|^\lambda\,&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|1}}}}
where ''&amp;fnof;'' is a distribution on the unit sphere ''S''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;.  The number &amp;lambda;, which is the degree of the homogeneous distribution ''S'', may be real or complex.

Any homogeneous distribution of the form ({{EquationNote|1}}) on {{nowrap|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; \ {0}}} extends uniquely to a homogeneous distribution on '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; provided {{nowrap|Re &amp;lambda; &gt; &amp;minus;''n''}}.  In fact, an analytic continuation argument similar to the one-dimensional case extends this for all {{nowrap|&amp;lambda; ≠ &amp;minus;''n'', &amp;minus;''n''&amp;minus;1, ...}}.

"'''How Long Is the Coast of Britain? Statistical Self-Similarity and Fractional Dimension'''" is a paper by [[mathematician]] [[Benoît Mandelbrot]], first published in [[Science (journal)|''Science'']] in 5 May 1967.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mandelbrot|first1=B.|authorlink1=Benoît Mandelbrot|title=How Long Is the Coast of Britain? Statistical Self-Similarity and Fractional Dimension|journal=Science|date= 1967|volume=156|issue=3775|pages=636–638|doi=10.1126/science.156.3775.636}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this paper, Mandelbrot discusses [[self-similarity|self-similar]] curves that have [[Hausdorff dimension]] between 1 and 2. These curves are examples of ''[[fractal]]s'', although Mandelbrot does not use this term in the paper, as he did not coin it until 1975. The paper is one of Mandelbrot's first publications on the topic of fractals.&lt;ref&gt;"Dr. Mandelbrot traced his work on fractals to a question he first encountered as a young researcher: how long is the coast of Britain?": Benoit Mandelbrot (1967). "[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/17/us/17mandelbrot.html?adxnnl=1&amp;adxnnlx=1332064840-/vD0Sjafcl9t9BNghRf8Qw Benoît Mandelbrot, Novel Mathematician, Dies at 85]", ''The New York Times''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The paper examines the [[coastline paradox]]: the property that the measured length of a stretch of coastline depends on the scale of measurement.  Empirical evidence suggests that the smaller the increment of measurement, the longer the measured length becomes.  If one were to measure a stretch of coastline with a [[yardstick]], one would get a shorter result than if the same stretch were measured with a one-foot (30.48 cm) [[ruler]].  This is because one would be laying the ruler along a more curvilinear route than that followed by the yardstick. The empirical evidence suggests a rule which, if extrapolated, shows that the measure length increases without limit as the measurement scale decreases towards zero. 

This discussion implies that it is meaningless to talk about the length of a coastline; some other means of quantifying coastlines are needed. Mandelbrot discusses an empirical law discovered by [[Lewis Fry Richardson]], who observed that the measured length ''L''(''G'') of various geographic borders was a function of the measurement scale ''G''. Collecting data from several different examples, Richardson conjectured that ''L''(''G'') could be closely approximated by a function of the form

:&lt;math&gt;L(G)=MG^{1-D}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''M'' is a positive constant and ''D'' is a constant, called the dimension, greater than or equal to 1. Intuitively, if a coastline looks smooth it should have dimension close to 1; and the more irregular the coastline looks the closer its dimension should be to 2. The examples in Richardson's research have dimensions ranging from 1.02 for the coastline of [[South Africa]] to 1.25  for the West coast of [[Great Britain|Britain]]. 

Mandelbrot then describes various mathematical curves, related to the [[Koch snowflake]], which are defined in such a way that they are strictly self-similar. Mandelbrot shows how to calculate the Hausdorff dimension of each of these curves, each of which has a dimension ''D'' between 1 and 2 (he also mentions but does not give a construction for the space-filling [[Peano curve]], which has a dimension exactly 2). He notes that the approximation of these curves with segments of length ''G'' have lengths of the form &lt;math&gt;G^{1-D}&lt;/math&gt;. The resemblance with Richardson's law is striking. The paper does not claim that any coastline or geographic border actually ''has'' fractional dimension. Instead, it notes that Richardson's empirical law is compatible with the idea that geographic curves, such as coastlines, can be modelled by random self-similar figures of fractional dimension.

Near the end of the paper Mandelbrot briefly discusses how one might approach the study of fractal-like objects in nature that look random rather than regular. For this he defines statistically self-similar figures and says that these are encountered in nature.

The paper is important because it is a "turning point" in Mandelbrot's early thinking on fractals.&lt;ref&gt;"What is the essence of a coastline, for example ? Mandelbrot asked this question in a paper that became a turning point for his thinking: 'How Long Is the Coast of Britain'": James Gleick (1988) ''[[Chaos: Making a New Science]]'', p.94. {{ISBN|978-0747404132}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It is an example of the linking of mathematical objects with natural forms that was a theme of much of his later work.

{{Pi box}}
The '''Indiana Pi Bill''' is the popular name for bill #246 of the 1897 sitting of the [[Indiana General Assembly]], one of the most notorious attempts to establish [[mathematical truth]] by [[legislative fiat]]. Despite its name, the main result claimed by the bill is a method to [[Squaring the circle|square the circle]], rather than to establish a certain value for the mathematical constant [[pi|{{pi}}]], the ratio of the [[circumference]] of a circle to its [[diameter]]. The bill, written by amateur mathematician Edward J. Goodwin, does imply various incorrect values of {{pi}}, such as 3.2.

The bill never became law, due to the intervention of Professor [[C. A. Waldo]] of [[Purdue University]], who happened to be present in the legislature on the day it went up for a vote.

The impossibility of squaring the circle using only [[compass and straightedge constructions]], suspected since ancient times, was rigorously proven in 1882 by [[Ferdinand von Lindemann]]. Better approximations of {{pi}} than those implied by the bill have been known since ancient times.

== Legislative history ==
In 1894, [[Indiana]] physician and amateur mathematician Edward J. Goodwin (ca. 1825–1902&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dudley|1992|p=195}}, citing an obituary&lt;/ref&gt;) believed that he had discovered a correct way of squaring the circle.&lt;ref&gt;Edward J. Goodwin (July 1894) "Quadrature of the circle," ''American Mathematical Monthly'', '''1'''(7):  246–248.

*  See also:  Edward J. Goodwin (1895) "(A) The trisection of an angle; (B) Duplication of the cube," ''American Mathematical Monthly'', '''2''': 337.&lt;/ref&gt; He proposed a bill to state representative Taylor I. Record, which Record introduced in the House under the long title "A Bill for an act introducing a new mathematical truth and offered as a contribution to education to be used only by the State of Indiana free of cost by paying any royalties whatever on the same, provided it is accepted and adopted by the official action of the Legislature of 1897".

The text of the bill consists of a series of mathematical claims (detailed below), followed by a recitation of Goodwin's previous accomplishments:

{{quote|... his solutions of the [[trisection of the angle]], [[doubling the cube]] and [[squaring the circle|quadrature of the circle]] having been already accepted as contributions to science by the ''[[American Mathematical Monthly]]'' ... And be it remembered that these noted problems had been long since given up by scientific bodies as unsolvable mysteries and above man's ability to comprehend.}} 

Goodwin's "solutions" were indeed published in the ''American Mathematical Monthly'', though with a disclaimer of "published by request of the author".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.math.rutgers.edu/~zeilberg/mamarim/mamarimhtml/ClearAFJ "Clearing the Misunderstanding Re My April Fool's `Joke'"], math.rutgers.edu.&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon its introduction in the [[Indiana House of Representatives]], the bill's language and topic occasioned confusion among the membership; a member from [[Bloomington, Indiana|Bloomington]] proposed that it be referred to the Finance Committee, but the Speaker accepted another member's recommendation to refer the bill to the Committee on Swamplands, where the bill could "find a deserved grave".&lt;ref name=hallerburg&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://journals.iupui.edu/index.php/ias/article/download/8180/8139 |title=House Bill No. 246 Revisited|first=Arthur E.|last=Hallenberg|journal=Proceedings of the Indiana Academy of Science|pages=376–399|year=1974|volume=84}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|385}}  It was transferred to the Committee on Education, which reported favorably;&lt;ref name=purdue&gt;[http://www.agecon.purdue.edu/crd/Localgov/Second%20Level%20pages/Indiana_Pi_Story.htm Indiana pi story] at a Purdue server&lt;/ref&gt; following a motion to [[Suspension of the rules|suspend the rules]], the bill passed on February 6,&lt;ref name=hallerburg /&gt;{{rp|390}} without a dissenting vote.&lt;ref name=purdue /&gt;  The news of the bill occasioned an alarmed response from ''Der Tägliche Telegraph'', a [[German language|German-language]] newspaper in Indianapolis, which viewed the event with significantly less favor than its English-speaking competitors.&lt;ref name=hallerburg /&gt;{{rp|385}}  As this debate concluded, [[Purdue University]] Professor [[C. A. Waldo]] arrived in [[Indianapolis]] to secure the annual appropriation for the [[Indiana Academy of Science]]. An assemblyman handed him the bill, offering to introduce him to the genius who wrote it. He declined, saying that he already met as many crazy people as he cared to.&lt;ref name=purdue /&gt;&lt;ref name="waldo-ref"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Waldo|first1=C. A.|title=What Might Have Been|journal=Proceedings of the Indiana Academy of Science|date=1916|pages=445–446|url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/14641808#page/455/|accessdate=24 April 2017|ref=waldo-ref}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When it reached the [[Indiana Senate]], the bill was not treated so kindly, for Waldo had coached the senators previously.  The committee to which it had been assigned reported it unfavorably, and the Senate [[Table (parliamentary procedure)|tabled]] it on February 12;&lt;ref name=hallerburg /&gt;{{rp|386}} it was nearly passed, but opinion changed when one senator observed that the General Assembly lacked the power to define mathematical truth.&lt;ref name=hallerburg /&gt;{{rp|391}}  Influencing some of the senators was a report that major newspapers, such as the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', had begun to ridicule the situation.&lt;ref name=hallerburg /&gt;{{rp|390}}

According to the ''Indianapolis News'' article of February 13, page 11, column 3:&lt;ref name="indianapolis-news"&gt;{{cite news|title=THE MATHEMATICAL BILL. Fun-Making In the Senate Yester-day Afternoon--Other Action.|url=https://newspapers.library.in.gov/cgi-bin/indiana?a=d&amp;d=INN18970213-01.1.11|accessdate=24 April 2017|work=Indianapolis News|date=13 February 1897|ref=indianapolis-news}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;... the bill was brought up and made fun of.  The Senators made bad puns about it, ridiculed it and laughed over it.  The fun lasted half an hour.  Senator Hubbell said that it was not meet for the Senate, which was costing the State $250 a day, to waste its time in such frivolity.  He said that in reading the leading newspapers of Chicago and the East, he found that the Indiana State Legislature had laid itself open to ridicule by the action already taken on the bill.  He thought consideration of such a proposition was not dignified or worthy of the Senate.  He moved the indefinite postponement of the bill, and the motion carried.&lt;ref name=purdue /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Mathematics ==

=== Approximation of π ===

Although the bill has become known as the "Pi Bill", its text does not mention the name "pi" at all, and Goodwin appears to have thought of the ratio between the circumference and diameter of a circle as distinctly secondary to his main aim of squaring the circle. Towards the end of Section 2 the following passage appears:

{{quote|Furthermore, it has revealed the ratio of the chord and arc of ninety degrees, which is as seven to eight, and also the ratio of the diagonal and one side of a square which is as ten to seven, disclosing the fourth important fact, that the ratio of the diameter and circumference is as five-fourths to four[.]&lt;ref name="bill_text"&gt;[http://www.agecon.purdue.edu/crd/Localgov/Second%20Level%20pages/indiana_pi_bill.htm Text of the bill]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This comes close to an explicit claim that &lt;math&gt;\pi = \frac{4}{1.25} = 3.2&lt;/math&gt;, and that &lt;math&gt; \sqrt{2} = \frac{10}{7} \approx 1.429&lt;/math&gt;.

This quotation is often read as three mutually incompatible assertions, but they fit together well if the statement about {{radic|2}} is taken to be about the inscribed square (with the circle's diameter as diagonal) rather than the square on the radius (with the chord of 90° as diagonal). Together they describe the circle shown in the figure, whose diameter is 10 and circumference is 32; the chord of 90° is taken to be 7. Both of the values 7 and 32 are within a few percent of the true lengths for a diameter-10 circle (which does not justify Goodwin's presentation of them as exact). The circumference should be nearer to 31.4159 and the diagonal "7" should be the [[square root]] of 50 (=25+25), or nearer to 7.071.

=== Area of the circle ===

Goodwin's main goal was not to measure lengths in the circle but to ''square'' it, which he interpreted literally as finding a square with the same area as the circle. He knew that [[Archimedes]]' formula for the area of a circle, which calls for multiplying the diameter by one fourth of the circumference, is not considered a solution to the ancient problem of [[squaring the circle]]. This is because the problem is to ''construct'' the area using [[compass and straightedge]] only, and Archimedes did not give a method for constructing a straight line with the same length as the circumference. Apparently, Goodwin was unaware of this central requirement; he believed that the problem with the Archimedean formula is that it gives wrong numerical results, and that a solution of the ancient problem should consist of replacing it with a "correct" formula. In the bill he proposed, without argument, his own method:

{{quote|It has been found that a circular area is to the square on a line equal to the quadrant of the circumference, as the area of an equilateral rectangle is to the square on one side.&lt;ref name="bill_text" /&gt;}}

This appears needlessly convoluted, as an "[[equilateral]] rectangle" is, by definition, a [[square]]. In simple terms, the assertion is that the area of a circle is the same as that of a square with the same perimeter. This claim results in other mathematical contradictions to which Goodwin attempts to respond. For example, right after the above quote the bill goes on to say:

{{quote|The diameter employed as the linear unit according to the present rule in computing the circle's area is entirely wrong, as it represents the circle's area one and one-fifth times the area of a square whose perimeter is equal to the circumference of the circle.}}

In the model circle above, the Archimedean area (accepting Goodwin's values for the circumference and diameter) would be 80, whereas Goodwin's proposed rule leads to an area of 64. Now, 80 exceeds 64 by one fifth ''of 80'', and Goodwin appears to confuse 64 = 80×(1−{{frac|5}}) with 80 = 64×(1+{{frac|5}}), an approximation that works only for fractions much smaller than {{frac|5}}.

The area found by Goodwin's rule is {{frac|{{pi}}|4}} times the true area of the circle, which in many accounts of the Pi Bill is interpreted as a claim that {{pi}} = 4. However, there is no internal evidence in the bill that Goodwin intended to make such a claim; on the contrary, he repeatedly denies that the area of the circle has anything to do with its diameter.

The relative ''area'' error of 1−{{frac|{{pi}}|4}} works out to about 21 percent, which is much more grave than the approximations of the ''lengths'' in the model circle of the previous section. It is unknown what made Goodwin believe that his rule could be correct. In general, figures with identical perimeters do not have identical area (see [[isoperimetry]]); the typical demonstration of this fact is to compare a long thin shape with a small enclosed area (the area approaching zero as the width decreases) to one of the same perimeter that is approximately as tall as it is wide (the area approaching the square of the width), obviously of much greater area.

{{Functions}}
{{Distinguish|Multiplicative inverse}}
In [[mathematics]], an '''inverse function''' (or '''anti-function'''&lt;ref name="Hall_1909"/&gt;) is a [[function (mathematics)|function]] that "reverses" another function: if the function {{mvar|f}} applied to an input {{mvar|x}} gives a result of {{mvar|y}}, then applying its inverse function {{mvar|g}} to {{mvar|y}} gives the result {{mvar|x}}, and vice versa, i.e., {{math|1=''f''(''x'') = ''y''}} [[if and only if]] {{math|1=''g''(''y'') = ''x''}}.&lt;ref name="Keisler"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Scheinerman_2013"/&gt;

As an example, consider the real-valued function of a real variable given by {{math|1=''f''(''x'') = 5''x'' − 7}}. Thinking of this as a step-by-step procedure (namely, take a number {{mvar|x}}, multiply it by 5, then subtract 7 from the result), to reverse this and get {{mvar|x}} back from some output value, say {{mvar|y}}, we should undo each step in reverse order. In this case that means that we should add 7 to {{mvar|y}} and then divide the result by 5. In functional notation this inverse function would be given by,
:&lt;math&gt;g(y) = \frac{y + 7}{5}.&lt;/math&gt;
With {{math|1=''y'' = 5''x'' − 7}} we have that {{math|1=''f''(''x'') = ''y''}} and {{math|1=''g''(''y'') = ''x''}}.

Not all functions have inverse functions. In order for a function {{math|''f'': ''X'' → ''Y''}} to have an inverse,&lt;ref group="nb" name="NB1"/&gt; it must have the property that [[for every]] {{mvar|y}} in {{mvar|Y}} there must be [[uniqueness quantification|one, and only one]] {{mvar|x}} in {{mvar|X}} so that {{math|1=''f''(''x'') = ''y''}}. This property ensures that a function {{math|''g'': ''Y'' → ''X''}} will exist having the necessary relationship with {{mvar|f}}.

==Definitions==
[[Image:Inverse Functions Domain and Range.png|thumb|right|240px|If {{mvar|f}} maps {{mvar|X}} to {{mvar|Y}}, then {{math|''f''&lt;sup&gt; −1&lt;/sup&gt;}} maps {{mvar|Y}} back to {{mvar|X}}.]]

Let {{mvar|f}} be a function whose [[domain of a function|domain]] is the [[Set (mathematics)|set]] {{mvar|X}}, and whose [[Range (mathematics)|image (range)]] is the set {{mvar|Y}}. Then {{mvar|f}} is ''invertible'' if there exists a function {{mvar|g}} with domain {{mvar|Y}} and image {{mvar|X}}, with the property:
:&lt;math&gt;f(x) = y\,\,\Leftrightarrow\,\,g(y) = x.&lt;/math&gt;

If {{mvar|f}} is invertible, the function {{mvar|g}} is [[unique (mathematics)|unique]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Devlin|2004|loc=p. 101, Theorem 4.5.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; which means that there is exactly one function {{mvar|g}} satisfying this property (no more, no less). That function {{mvar|g}} is then called ''the'' inverse of {{mvar|f}}, and is usually denoted as {{math|''f''&lt;sup&gt; −1&lt;/sup&gt;}}.&lt;ref group="nb" name="NB2"/&gt;

Stated otherwise, a function, considered as a [[binary relation]], has an inverse if and only if the [[converse relation]] is a function on the range {{mvar|Y}}, in which case the converse relation is the inverse function.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|Eggen|St. Andre|2006|loc=p. 202, Theorem 4.9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all functions have an inverse. For a function to have an inverse, each element {{math|''y'' ∈ ''Y''}} must correspond to no more than one {{math|''x'' ∈ ''X''}}; a function {{mvar|f}} with this property is called one-to-one or an [[injective function|injection]]. If {{math|''f''&lt;sup&gt; −1&lt;/sup&gt;}} is to be a [[function (mathematics)|function]] on {{mvar|Y}}, then each element {{math|''y'' ∈ ''Y''}} must correspond to some {{math|''x'' ∈ ''X''}}. Functions with this property are called [[surjective function|surjections]]. This property is satisfied by definition if {{mvar|Y}} is the image (range) of {{mvar|f}}, but may not hold in a more general context. To be invertible a function must be both an injection and a surjection. Such functions are called [[bijections]]. The inverse of an injection {{math| ''f'': ''X'' → ''Y''}} that is not a bijection, that is, a function that is not a surjection, is only a [[partial function]] on {{mvar|Y}}, which means that for some {{math|''y'' ∈ ''Y''}}, {{math|''f''&lt;sup&gt; −1&lt;/sup&gt;(''y'')}} is undefined. If a function {{mvar|f}} is invertible, then both it and its inverse function {{math|''f''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;}} are bijections.

There is another convention used in the definition of functions. This can be referred to as the "set-theoretic" or "graph" definition using [[ordered pair]]s in which a [[codomain]] is never referred to.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wolf|1998|loc=p.198}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under this convention all functions are surjections,&lt;ref group="nb" name="NB3"/&gt; and so, being a bijection simply means being an injection. Authors using this convention may use the phrasing that a function is invertible if and only if it is an injection.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fletcher|Patty|1988|loc=p. 116 Theorem 5.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two conventions need not cause confusion as long as it is remembered that in this alternate convention the codomain of a function is always taken to be the range of the function.

===Example: Squaring and square root functions===
The function {{math|''f'': ℝ → [0,∞)}} given by {{math|1=''f''(''x'') = ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} is not injective since each possible result ''y'' (except 0) corresponds to two different starting points in {{mvar|X}} – one positive and one negative, and so this function is not invertible. With this type of function it is impossible to deduce an input from its output. Such a function is called non-[[Injective function|injective]] or, in some applications, information-losing.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

If the domain of the function is restricted to the nonnegative reals, that is, the function is redefined to be {{math|''f'': [0, ∞) → [0, ∞)}} with the same ''rule'' as before, then the function is bijective and so, invertible.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lay|2006|loc=p.69 Example 7.24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inverse function here is called the ''(positive) square root function''.
&lt;!-- Repetitive. To be held for a short time until refactor is finished. 
===Inverses in higher mathematics===
The definition given above is commonly adopted in [[set theory]] and [[calculus]]. In higher mathematics, the notation
:&lt;math&gt;f\colon X \to Y &lt;/math&gt;
means "{{mvar|f}} is a function mapping elements of a set {{mvar|X}} to elements of a set {{mvar|Y }}".  The source, {{mvar|X}}, is called the domain of {{mvar|f}}, and the target, {{mvar|Y}}, is called the [[codomain]].  The codomain contains the range of {{mvar|f}} as a [[subset]], and is part of the definition of {{mvar|f}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|Eggen|St. Andre|2006|loc=p. 179}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When using codomains, the inverse of a function {{math| ''f'': ''X'' → ''Y''}} is required to have domain {{mvar|Y}} and codomain {{mvar|X}}.  For the inverse to be defined on all of {{mvar|Y}}, every element of {{mvar|Y}} must lie in the range of the function {{mvar|f}}.  A function with this property is called ''onto'' or ''[[Surjective function|surjective]]''.  Thus, a function with a codomain is invertible if and only if it is both ''[[Injective function|injective]]'' (one-to-one) and surjective (onto).  Such a function is called a one-to-one correspondence or a [[bijection]], and has the property that every element {{math| ''y'' ∈ ''Y''}} corresponds to exactly one element {{math| ''x'' ∈ ''X''}}.

==={{anchor|Compositional inverse}}Inverses and composition===
{{See also|Inverse element}}

If {{mvar|f}} is an invertible function with domain {{mvar|X}} and range {{mvar|Y}}, then

:&lt;math&gt; f^{-1}\left( \, f(x) \, \right) = x&lt;/math&gt;, for every &lt;math&gt;x \in X. &lt;/math&gt;

Using the [[composition of functions]] we can rewrite this statement as follows:

:&lt;math&gt; f^{-1} \circ f = \operatorname{id}_X, &lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|id&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the [[identity function]] on the set {{mvar|X}}; that is, the function that leaves its argument unchanged. In [[category theory]], this statement is used as the definition of an inverse [[morphism]].

Considering function composition helps to understand the notation {{math|''f''&lt;sup&gt; −1&lt;/sup&gt;}}. Repeatedly composing a function with itself is called [[iterated function|iteration]]. If {{mvar|f}} is applied {{mvar|n}} times, starting with the value {{mvar|x}}, then this is written as {{math|''f''&lt;sup&gt; ''n''&lt;/sup&gt;(''x'')}}; so {{math|''f''&lt;sup&gt; 2&lt;/sup&gt;(''x'') {{=}} ''f'' (''f'' (''x''))}}, etc. Since {{math|''f''&lt;sup&gt; −1&lt;/sup&gt;(''f'' (''x'')) {{=}} ''x''}}, composing {{math|''f''&lt;sup&gt; −1&lt;/sup&gt;}} and {{math|''f''&lt;sup&gt; ''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} yields {{math|''f''&lt;sup&gt; ''n''−1&lt;/sup&gt;}}, "undoing" the effect of one application of {{mvar|f}}.

===Note on notation===

While the notation {{math|''f''&lt;sup&gt; −1&lt;/sup&gt;(''x'')}} might be misunderstood, {{math|(''f''(''x''))&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;}} certainly denotes the [[multiplicative inverse]] of {{math|''f''(''x'')}} and has nothing to do with the inverse function of {{mvar|f}}.

In keeping with the general notation, some English&lt;ref name="Hall_1909"/&gt; authors use expressions like {{math|sin&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;(''x'')}} to denote the inverse of the sine function applied to {{mvar|x}} (actually a [[#Partial inverses|partial inverse]]; see below)&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Thomas|1972|loc=pp. 304-309}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other authors feel that this may be confused with the notation for the multiplicative inverse of {{math|sin (''x'')}}, which can be denoted as {{math|(sin (''x''))&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;}}. To avoid any confusion, an [[inverse trigonometric function]] is often indicated by the prefix "[[arc (function prefix)|arc]]" (for Latin ''arcus'').&lt;ref name="Hall_1909"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Korn_2000"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Atlas_2009"/&gt; For instance, the inverse of the sine function is typically called the [[arcsine]] function, written as {{math|[[arcsin]](''x'')}}.&lt;ref name="Hall_1909"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Korn_2000"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Atlas_2009"/&gt; Similarly, the inverse of a [[hyperbolic function]] is indicated by the prefix "[[ar (function prefix)|ar]]" (for Latin ''area'').&lt;ref name="Atlas_2009"/&gt; For instance, the inverse of the [[hyperbolic sine]] function is typically written as {{math|[[arsinh]](''x'')}}.&lt;ref name="Atlas_2009"/&gt; Other inverse special functions are sometimes prefixed with the prefix "inv" if the ambiguity of the {{math|''f''&lt;sup&gt; −1&lt;/sup&gt;}} notation should be avoided.&lt;ref name="Hall_1909"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Atlas_2009"/&gt;

==Properties==
Since a function is a special type of [[binary relation]], many of the properties of an inverse function correspond to properties of [[converse relation]]s.

===Uniqueness===
If an inverse function exists for a given function {{mvar|f}}, then it is unique.&lt;ref name="Wolf72"&gt;{{harvnb|Wolf|1998|loc=p. 208 Theorem 7.2}}&lt;/ref&gt; This follows since the inverse function must be the converse relation which is completely determined by {{mvar|f}}.

===Symmetry===
There is a symmetry between a function and its inverse. Specifically, if {{mvar|f}} is an invertible function with domain {{mvar|X}} and range {{mvar|Y}}, then its inverse {{math|''f''&lt;sup&gt; −1&lt;/sup&gt;}} has domain {{mvar|Y}} and range {{mvar|X}}, and the inverse of {{math|''f''&lt;sup&gt; −1&lt;/sup&gt;}} is the original function {{mvar|f}}. In symbols, for functions {{math|''f'':''X'' → ''Y''}}  and {{math|''f''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;:''Y'' → ''X''}},&lt;ref name=Wolf72 /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;f^{-1}\circ f = \operatorname{id}_X &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; f \circ f^{-1} = \operatorname{id}_Y.&lt;/math&gt;

This statement is a consequence of the implication that for {{mvar|f}} to be invertible it must be bijective. The [[involution (mathematics)|involutory]] nature of the inverse can be concisely expressed by&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|Eggen|St. Andre|2006|loc=pg. 141 Theorem 3.3(a)}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
:&lt;math&gt;\left(f^{-1}\right)^{-1} = f.&lt;/math&gt;

[[Image:Composition of Inverses.png|thumb|right|240px|The inverse of {{math| ''g'' ∘ ''f'' }} is {{math| ''f''&lt;sup&gt; −1&lt;/sup&gt; ∘ ''g''&lt;sup&gt; −1&lt;/sup&gt;}}.]]
The inverse of a composition of functions is given by&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lay|2006|loc=p. 71 Theorem 7.26}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
:&lt;math&gt;(g \circ f)^{-1} = f^{-1} \circ g^{-1}.&lt;/math&gt;
Notice that the order of {{mvar|g}} and {{mvar|f}} have been reversed; to undo {{mvar|f}} followed by {{mvar|g}}, we must first undo {{mvar|g}} and then undo {{mvar|f}}.

For example, let {{math|1= ''f''(''x'') = 3''x''}} and let {{math|1= ''g''(''x'') = ''x'' + 5}}.  Then the composition {{math| ''g'' ∘ ''f''}} is the function that first multiplies by three and then adds five,
:&lt;math&gt;(g \circ f)(x) = 3x + 5.&lt;/math&gt;
To reverse this process, we must first subtract five, and then divide by three,
:&lt;math&gt;(g \circ f)^{-1}(x) = \tfrac13(x - 5).&lt;/math&gt;
This is the composition
{{math| (''f''&lt;sup&gt; −1&lt;/sup&gt; ∘ ''g''&lt;sup&gt; −1&lt;/sup&gt;)(''x'')}}.

===Self-inverses===
If {{mvar|X}} is a set, then the [[identity function]] on {{mvar|X}} is its own inverse:

:&lt;math&gt;{\operatorname{id}_X}^{-1} = \operatorname{id}_X.&lt;/math&gt;

More generally, a function {{math| ''f'' : ''X'' → ''X''}} is equal to its own inverse if and only if the composition {{math| ''f'' ∘ ''f''}} is equal to {{math|id&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;}}. Such a function is called an [[Involution (mathematics)|involution]].

==Inverses in calculus==
Single-variable [[calculus]] is primarily concerned with functions that map [[real number]]s to real numbers. Such functions are often defined through [[formula]]s, such as:
:&lt;math&gt;f(x) = (2x + 8)^3 .&lt;/math&gt;
A surjective function {{mvar|f}} from the real numbers to the real numbers possesses an inverse as long as it is one-to-one, i.e. as long as the graph of {{math|1=''y'' = ''f''(''x'')}} has, for each possible {{mvar|y}} value only one corresponding {{mvar|x}} value, and thus passes the [[horizontal line test]].

The following table shows several standard functions and their inverses:

===Formula for the inverse===
One approach to finding a formula for {{math|''f''&lt;sup&gt; −1&lt;/sup&gt;}}, if it exists, is to solve the [[equation]] {{math|1= ''y'' = ''f''(''x'') }} for {{mvar|x}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Devlin|2004|loc=p. 101}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, if {{mvar|f}} is the function

:&lt;math&gt;f(x) = (2x + 8)^3 &lt;/math&gt;

then we must solve the equation {{math|1= ''y'' = (2''x'' + 8)&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}} for {{mvar|x}}:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
      y         &amp; = (2x+8)^3 \\
  \sqrt[3]{y}   &amp; = 2x + 8   \\
\sqrt[3]{y} - 8 &amp; = 2x       \\
\dfrac{\sqrt[3]{y} - 8}{2} &amp; = x .
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Thus the inverse function {{math|''f''&lt;sup&gt; −1&lt;/sup&gt;}} is given by the formula

:&lt;math&gt;f^{-1}(y) = \frac{\sqrt[3]{y} - 8} 2.&lt;/math&gt;

Sometimes the inverse of a function cannot be expressed by a formula with a finite number of terms.  For example, if {{mvar|f}} is the function

:&lt;math&gt;f(x) = x - \sin x ,&lt;/math&gt;

then {{mvar|f}} is a bijection, and therefore possesses an inverse function {{math|''f''&lt;sup&gt; −1&lt;/sup&gt;}}.  The [[Kepler's equation#Inverse Kepler equation|formula for this inverse]] has an infinite number of terms:

:&lt;math&gt; f^{-1}(y) =
\sum_{n=1}^\infty
 \frac{y^{n/3}}{n!} \lim_{ \theta \to 0} \left(
 \frac{\mathrm{d}^{\,n-1}}{\mathrm{d} \theta^{\,n-1}} \left(
 \frac \theta { \sqrt[3]{ \theta - \sin( \theta )} } \right)^n
\right).
&lt;/math&gt;

===Graph of the inverse===
[[Image:Inverse Function Graph.png|thumb|right|The graphs of {{math|1= ''y'' = ''f''(''x'') }} and {{math|1= ''y'' = ''f''&lt;sup&gt; −1&lt;/sup&gt;(''x'')}}. The dotted line is {{math|1= ''y'' = ''x''}}.]]
If  {{mvar|f}} is invertible, then the graph of the function

:&lt;math&gt;y = f^{-1}(x)&lt;/math&gt;

is the same as the graph of the equation

:&lt;math&gt;x = f(y) .&lt;/math&gt;

This is identical to the equation {{math|1= ''y'' = ''f''(''x'')}} that defines the graph of {{mvar|f}}, except that the roles of {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|y}} have been reversed.  Thus the graph of {{math|''f''&lt;sup&gt; −1&lt;/sup&gt;}} can be obtained from the graph of {{mvar|f}} by switching the positions of the {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|y}} axes.  This is equivalent to [[Reflection (mathematics)|reflecting]] the graph across the line
{{math|1= ''y'' = ''x''}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Briggs|Cochran|2011|loc=pp. 28-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inverses and derivatives===
A [[continuous function]] {{mvar|f}} is invertible on its range (image) if and only if it is either strictly [[monotonic function|increasing or decreasing]] (with no local [[maxima and minima|maxima or minima]]).  For example, the function

:&lt;math&gt;f(x) = x^3 + x&lt;/math&gt;

is invertible, since the [[derivative]]
{{math|1= ''f&amp;prime;''(''x'') = 3''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 1 }} is always positive.

If the function {{mvar|f}} is [[Differentiable function|differentiable]] on an interval {{mvar|I}} and {{math| ''f&amp;prime;''(''x'') ≠ 0}} for each {{math|''x'' ∈ ''I''}}, then the inverse {{math|''f''&lt;sup&gt; −1&lt;/sup&gt;}} will be differentiable on {{math|''f''(''I'')}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lay|2006|loc=p. 246 Theorem 26.10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  If {{math|1= ''y'' = ''f''(''x'')}}, the derivative of the inverse is given by the [[inverse function theorem]],
:&lt;math&gt;\left(f^{-1}\right)^\prime (y)  = \frac{1}{f'\left(x \right)}. &lt;/math&gt;
Using [[Leibniz's notation]] the formula above can be written as
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dx}{dy} = \frac{1}{dy / dx}. &lt;/math&gt;
This result follows from the [[chain rule]] (see the article on [[inverse functions and differentiation]]).

The inverse function theorem can be generalized to functions of several variables.  Specifically, a differentiable [[real multivariable function|multivariable function]] {{math| ''f '': '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; → '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} is invertible in a neighborhood of a point {{mvar|p}} as long as the [[Jacobian matrix and determinant|Jacobian matrix]] of {{mvar|f}} at {{mvar|p}} is [[invertible matrix|invertible]].  In this case, the Jacobian of {{math|''f''&lt;sup&gt; −1&lt;/sup&gt;}} at {{math|''f''(''p'')}} is the [[matrix inverse]] of the Jacobian of {{mvar|f}} at {{mvar|p}}.

== Real-world examples ==
* Let {{mvar|f}} be the function that converts a temperature in degrees [[Celsius]] to a temperature in degrees [[Fahrenheit]],
::&lt;math&gt; F = f(C) = \tfrac95 C + 32 ;&lt;/math&gt;
:then its inverse function converts degrees Fahrenheit to degrees Celsius,
::&lt;math&gt; C = f^{-1}(F) = \tfrac59 (F - 32) ,&lt;/math&gt;
:since
::&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
f^{-1} (f(C)) = {} &amp; f^{-1}\left(  \tfrac95 C + 32 \right) = \tfrac59 \left( (\tfrac95 C + 32 ) - 32 \right) =  C, \\
&amp; \text{for every value of } C, \text{ and } \\[6pt]
f\left(f^{-1}(F)\right) = {} &amp; f\left(\tfrac59 (F - 32)\right) = \tfrac95 \left(\tfrac59 (F - 32)\right) + 32 = F, \\
&amp; \text{for every value of } F.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

* Suppose {{mvar|f}} assigns each child in a family its birth year. An inverse function would output which child was born in a given year. However, if the family children born in the same year (for instance, twins or triplets, etc.) then the output cannot be known when the input is the common birth year. As well, if a year is given in which no child was born then a child cannot be named. But if each child was born in a separate year, and if we restrict attention to the three years in which a child was born, then we do have an inverse function. For example,
::&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
 f(\text{Allan})&amp;=2005 , \quad &amp; f(\text{Brad})&amp;=2007 , \quad &amp; f(\text{Cary})&amp;=2001 \\
 f^{-1}(2005)&amp;=\text{Allan} , \quad &amp; f^{-1}(2007)&amp;=\text{Brad} , \quad &amp; f^{-1}(2001)&amp;=\text{Cary}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

* Let {{mvar|R}} be the function that leads to an {{mvar|x}} percentage rise of some quantity, and {{mvar|F}} be the function producing an {{mvar|x}} percentage fall. Applied to $100 with {{mvar|x}} = 10%, we find that applying the first function followed by the second does not restore the original value of $100, demonstrating the fact that, despite appearances, these two functions are not inverses of each other.

==Generalizations==

===Partial inverses===
[[Image:Inverse square graph.svg|thumb|right|The square root of {{mvar|x}} is a partial inverse to {{math|1= ''f''(''x'') = ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}.]]
Even if a function {{mvar|f}} is not one-to-one, it may be possible to define a '''partial inverse''' of {{mvar|f}} by [[Function (mathematics)#Restrictions and extensions|restricting]] the domain.  For example, the function

:&lt;math&gt;f(x) = x^2&lt;/math&gt;

is not one-to-one, since {{math|1= ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = (−''x'')&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}.  However, the function becomes one-to-one if we restrict to the domain {{math| ''x'' ≥ 0}}, in which case

:&lt;math&gt;f^{-1}(y) = \sqrt{y} . &lt;/math&gt;

(If we instead restrict to the domain {{math| ''x'' ≤ 0}}, then the inverse is the negative of the square root of {{mvar|y}}.)  Alternatively, there is no need to restrict the domain if we are content with the inverse being a [[multivalued function]]:

:&lt;math&gt;f^{-1}(y) = \pm\sqrt{y} . &lt;/math&gt;

[[File:Inversa d'una cúbica gràfica.png|right|thumb|The inverse of this [[cubic function]] has three branches.]]
Sometimes this multivalued inverse is called the '''full inverse''' of {{mvar|f}}, and the portions (such as {{sqrt|{{mvar|x}}}} and −{{sqrt|{{mvar|x}}}}) are called ''branches''.  The most important branch of a multivalued function (e.g. the positive square root) is called the ''[[principal branch]]'', and its value at {{mvar|y}} is called the ''principal value'' of {{math|''f''&lt;sup&gt; −1&lt;/sup&gt;(''y'')}}.

For a continuous function on the real line, one branch is required between each pair of [[minima and maxima|local extrema]].  For example, the inverse of a [[cubic function]] with a local maximum and a local minimum has three branches (see the adjacent picture).

[[Image:Gràfica del arcsinus.png|right|thumb|The [[arcsine]] is a partial inverse of the [[sine]] function.]]
These considerations are particularly important for defining the inverses of [[trigonometric functions]].  For example, the [[sine function]] is not one-to-one, since

:&lt;math&gt;\sin(x + 2\pi) = \sin(x)&lt;/math&gt;

for every real {{mvar|x}} (and more generally {{math|1= sin(''x'' + 2{{pi}}''n'') = sin(''x'')}} for every [[integer]] {{mvar|n}}).  However, the sine is one-to-one on the interval
{{closed-closed|−{{sfrac|{{pi}}|2}}, {{sfrac|{{pi}}|2}}}}, and the corresponding partial inverse is called the [[arcsine]].  This is considered the principal branch of the inverse sine, so the principal value of the inverse sine is always between −{{sfrac|{{pi}}|2}} and {{sfrac|{{pi}}|2}}.  The following table describes the principal branch of each inverse trigonometric function:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Briggs|Cochran|2011|loc=pp. 39-42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If {{math|''f'': ''X'' → ''Y''}}, a '''left inverse''' for {{mvar|f}} (or ''[[retract (category theory)|retraction]]'' of {{mvar|f}} ) is a function {{math| ''g'': ''Y'' → ''X''}} such that

: &lt;math&gt;g \circ f = \operatorname{id}_X . &lt;/math&gt;

That is, the function {{mvar|g}} satisfies the rule

: &lt;math&gt;\text{If } f(x) = y, \text{ then } g(y) = x .&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, {{mvar|g}} must equal the inverse of {{mvar|f}} on the image of {{mvar|f}}, but may take any values for elements of {{mvar|Y}} not in the image. A function {{mvar|f}} with a left inverse is necessarily injective. In classical mathematics, every injective function {{mvar|f}} with a nonempty domain necessarily has a left inverse; however, this may fail in [[constructive mathematics]]. For instance, a left inverse of the inclusion {{math|{0,1} → '''R'''}} of the two-element set in the reals violates [[indecomposability]] by giving a [[Retract (category theory)|retraction]] of the real line to the set {{math|{0,1} }}.

A '''right inverse''' for {{mvar|f}} (or ''[[section (category theory)|section]]'' of {{mvar|f}} ) is a function {{math| ''h'': ''Y'' → ''X''}} such that

:&lt;math&gt;f \circ h = \operatorname{id}_Y . &lt;/math&gt;

That is, the function {{mvar|h}} satisfies the rule

:If &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle h(y) = x&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle f(x) = y .&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, {{math|''h''(''y'')}} may be any of the elements of {{mvar|X}} that map to {{mvar|y}} under {{mvar|f}}.  A function {{mvar|f}} has a right inverse if and only if it is surjective (though constructing such an inverse in general requires the [[axiom of choice]]).

An inverse which is both a left and right inverse must be unique. However, if {{mvar|g}} is a left inverse for {{mvar|f}}, then {{mvar|g}} may or may not be a right inverse for {{mvar|f}}; and if {{mvar|g}} is a right inverse for {{mvar|f}}, then {{mvar|g}} is not necessarily a left inverse for {{mvar|f}}. For example, let {{math|''f'': '''R''' &amp;rarr; {{closed-open|0, ∞}}}} denote the squaring map, such that {{math|1=''f''(''x'') = ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} for all {{mvar|x}} in {{math|'''R'''}}, and let  {{math|{{mvar|g}}: {{closed-open|0, ∞}} &amp;rarr; '''R'''}} denote the square root map, such that {{math|''g''(''x'') {{=}} }}{{radic|{{mvar|x}}}} for all {{math|''x'' ≥ 0}}. Then {{math|1=''f''(''g''(''x'')) = ''x''}} for all {{mvar|x}} in {{closed-open|0, ∞}}; that is, {{mvar|g}} is a right inverse to {{mvar|f}}. However, {{mvar|g}} is not a left inverse to {{mvar|f}}, since, e.g., {{math|1=''g''(''f''(−1)) = 1 ≠ −1}}.

===Preimages===
If {{math|''f'': ''X'' → ''Y''}} is any function (not necessarily invertible), the '''preimage''' (or '''inverse image''') of an element {{math| ''y'' &amp;isin; ''Y''}} is the set of all elements of {{mvar|X}} that map to {{mvar|y}}:

:&lt;math&gt;f^{-1}(\{y\}) = \left\{ x\in X : f(x) = y \right\} . &lt;/math&gt;

The preimage of {{mvar|y}} can be thought of as the [[image (mathematics)|image]] of {{mvar|y}} under the (multivalued) full inverse of the function {{mvar|f}}.

Similarly, if {{mvar|S}} is any [[subset]] of {{mvar|Y}}, the preimage of {{mvar|S}} is the set of all elements of {{mvar|X}} that map to {{mvar|S}}:

:&lt;math&gt;f^{-1}(S) = \left\{ x\in X : f(x) \in S \right\} . &lt;/math&gt;

For example, take a function {{math|''f'': '''R''' → '''R'''}}, where {{math|''f'': ''x'' ↦ ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}. This function is not invertible for reasons discussed [[#Example: squaring and square root functions|above]]. Yet preimages may be defined for subsets of the codomain:

:&lt;math&gt;f^{-1}(\left\{1,4,9,16\right\}) = \left\{-4,-3,-2,-1,1,2,3,4\right\}&lt;/math&gt;

The preimage of a single element {{math| ''y'' &amp;isin; ''Y''}} – a [[singleton set]] {{math|{''y''} }} – is sometimes called the ''[[fiber (mathematics)|fiber]]'' of {{mvar|y}}.  When {{mvar|Y}} is the set of real numbers, it is common to refer to {{math|''f''&lt;sup&gt; −1&lt;/sup&gt;({''y''})}} as a ''[[level set]]''.

==Notes==
{{reflist|group="nb"|refs=
&lt;ref group="nb" name="NB1"&gt;It is a common practice, when no ambiguity can arise, to leave off the term function and just refer to an inverse.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref group="nb" name="NB2"&gt;Not to be confused with numerical exponentiation such as taking the multiplicative inverse of a nonzero real number.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref group="nb" name="NB3"&gt;So this term is never used in this convention.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Issai Schur''' (January 10, 1875 – January 10, 1941) was a [[Russia]]n [[mathematician]] who worked in [[Germany]] for most of his life. He studied at the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|University of Berlin]]. He obtained his [[doctorate]] in 1901, became [[lecturer]] in 1903 and, after a stay at the [[University of Bonn]], [[professor]] in 1919.

As a student of [[Ferdinand Georg Frobenius]], he worked on [[group representation]]s (the subject with which he is most closely associated), but also in [[combinatorics]] and [[Quadratic residue#The Pólya–Vinogradov inequality|number theory]] and even [[theoretical physics]]. He is perhaps best known today for his result on the existence of the [[Schur decomposition]] and for his work on group representations ([[Schur's lemma]]).

Schur published under the name of both I. Schur, and J. Schur, the latter especially in ''[[Journal für die reine und angewandte Mathematik]]''. This has led to some confusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ledermann|first=W.|title=Issai Schur and his school in Berlin|journal=Bull. London Math. Soc.|year=1983|volume=15|issue=2|pages=97–106|doi=10.1112/blms/15.2.97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Childhood==
Issai Schur was born into a [[Jewish]] family, the son of the businessman Moses Schur and his wife Golde Schur (née Landau). He was born in [[Mogilev]] on the [[Dnieper River]] in what was then the [[Russian Empire]]. Schur used the name ''Schaia ''rather than ''Issai'' up in his middle twenties.&lt;ref&gt;Vogt, Annette. Issai Schur: als Wissenschaftler vertrieben. In Schoeps, Grozinger &amp; Mattenklott [401, S. 217–235 (1999)]&lt;/ref&gt; Schur's father may have been a wholesale merchant.&lt;ref&gt;The Kopelman Foundation. Mogiljow. JewishGen Belarus SIG, on ''The Jewish Encyclopedia Web site'' www.jewishgen.org/belarus/je_mogilev.htm conceived, created, and funded by The Kopelman Foundation, accessed 28 December 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1888, at the age of 13, Schur went to [[Liepāja]] ([[Courland]], now in [[Latvia]]), where his married sister and his brother lived, 640&amp;nbsp;km north-west of Mogilev. Kurland was one of the three [[Baltic governorates]] of Tsarist Russia, and since the Middle Ages the Baltic Germans were the trend-setting social class.&lt;ref&gt;Blaushild, Immanuel. Libau. In Snyder [423, §1 (c. 1995)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Snyder, Stephen, project coordinator. ''A Town Named Libau (Liepaja, Latvia)''. JewishGen Web site www.Jewlshgen.org/ylzkor/libau/libau.html accessed 27 December 2003. (Translation of the 36-page booklet: ''A Town Named Libau in English, German and Hebrew and additional material about Libau'', Editor and Publisher of booklet unknown, believed to have been published in Israel, 1985.)&lt;/ref&gt; The local Jewish community spoke mostly German and not Yiddish.&lt;ref&gt;Beare, Arlene, ed. ''History of Latvia and Courland'' Web site accessed 1 March 2004: www.jewishgen.org/Latvia/SIG_History_of_Latvia_and_Courland.html (This history is derived from a few sources including [38] but mainly edited from the presentation made by Ruvin Ferber at the 21st International Conference of Jewish Genealogy held in London in July 2001.)&lt;/ref&gt;

Schur attended the German-speaking [[Nicolai Gymnasium in Libau]] from 1888–1894 and reached the top grade in his final examination, and received a gold medal.&lt;ref&gt;vgl. Vogt, Anne&lt;/ref&gt; Here he became fluent in German.

==Education==
In October 1894, Schur attended the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|University of Berlin]], with concentration in mathematics and physics. In 1901, he graduated ''summa cum laude'' under Frobenius and [[Lazarus Immanuel Fuchs]] with his dissertation ''On a class of matrices that can be assigned to a given matrix'',&lt;ref&gt;Schur, Issai. Über eine Klasse von Matrizen, die sich einer gegebenen Matrix zuordnen lassen. Doctoral dissertation, Universität Berlin, 1901; reprinted in Brauer k Rohrbach [71, Band I, pp. 1–72 (1973)]&lt;/ref&gt; which contains a general theory of the representation of [[linear group]]s. According to Vogt,&lt;ref&gt;vgl. Vogt, Anne&lt;/ref&gt; he began to use the name ''Issai'' at this time. Schur thought that his chance of success in the Russian Empire was rather poor,&lt;ref&gt;Chandler, Bruce; Magnus, Wilhelm. The History of Combinatorial Group Theory: A Case Study in the History of Ideas. Studies in the History of Mathematics and Physical Sciences 9. Springer-Verlag, New York, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; and because he spoke German so perfectly, he remained in Berlin. He graduated in 1903 and was a lecturer at the University of Berlin. Schur held a position as professor at the Berlin University for the ten years from 1903 to 1913.&lt;ref&gt;vgl. Biographie der Leopoldino Carolina&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1913 he accepted an appointment as associate professor and successor of [[Felix Hausdorff]] at the [[University of Bonn]]. In the following years Frobenius tried various ways to get Schur back to Berlin. Among other things, Schur's name was mentioned in a letter dated June 27, 1913&lt;ref&gt;Hermann Weyl: Nachlaß. Handschriften und Nachlässe, ETH Bibliothek, 1006:1.&lt;/ref&gt; from Frobenius to Robert Gnehm (the School Board President of the ETH)  as a possible successor to [[Carl Friedrich Geiser]].&lt;ref&gt;Carl Friedrich Geiser (1843–1934), der bei Ludwig Schläfli in Bern promoviert hatte, war von 1873 bis 1913 ordentlicher Professor am Eidgenössischen Polytechnikum in Zürich.&lt;/ref&gt; Frobenius complained that they had never followed his advice before and then said: "That is why I can't even recommend Prof. J. Schur (now in Bonn) to you. He's too good for Zurich, and should be my successor in Berlin". [[Hermann Weyl]] got the job in Zurich. The efforts of Frobenius were finally successful in 1916, when Schur succeeded Johannes Knoblauch as adjunct professor. Frobenius died a year later, on August 3, 1917. Schur and Carathéodory were both named as the frontrunners for his successor. But they chose [[Constantin Carathéodory]] in the end. In 1919 Schur finally received a personal professorship, and in 1921 he took over the chair of the retired [[Friedrich Hermann Schottky]]. In 1922, he was also added to the Prussian Academy of Sciences.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

==During the time of National Socialism==
After the takeover by the [[National Socialists]] and the elimination of the parliamentary opposition, the Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service on 7 April 1933, prescribed the release of all distinguished public servants that held unpopular political opinions or who were "Jewish" in origin; a subsequent regulation&lt;ref&gt;3. Verordnung zur Durchführung des Berufsbeamtengesetzes. Vom 6. Mai 1933, RGBl.I S.245f.&lt;/ref&gt; extended this to professors and therefore also to Schur. Schur was suspended and excluded from the university system. His colleague [[Erhard Schmidt]] fought for his reinstatement, and since Schur had been a Prussian official before the [[First World War]],&lt;ref&gt;Diese sogenannten "Altbeamten" waren von der Entlassung wegen jüdischer Abstammung vorerst ausgenommen, 1. Verordnung zur Durchführung des Berufsbeamtengesetzes. Vom 11. April 1933, RGBl.I S.195.&lt;/ref&gt; he was allowed to participate in certain special lectures on teaching in the winter semester of 1933/1934 again. Schur withdrew his application for leave from the Science Minister and passed up the offer of a visiting professorship at the [[University of Wisconsin-Madison]] for the academic year 1933–34.&lt;ref&gt;Walter Ledermann, Peter M. Neumann: The Life of Issai Schur through Letters and other Documents. In Anthony Joseph et al. ''Studies in Memory of Issai Schur'', Birkhäuser 2003. Brief des Ministeriums vom 11. September 1933, Brief von Schur vom 15. September 1933&lt;/ref&gt; One element that likely played a role in the rejection of the offer was that Schur no longer felt he could cope with the requirements that would have come with a new beginning in an English-speaking environment.&lt;ref&gt;Diese Ansicht vertritt Alfred Brauer in seiner Gedenkrede&lt;/ref&gt;

Already in 1932, Schur's daughter Hilde had married the doctor Chaim Abelin in Bern.&lt;ref&gt;Schur war sein 1906 mit der Ärztin Regina Frumkin verheiratet. Der Ehe entsprossen zwei Kinder Georg und Hilde. Georg, der etwas älter als Hilde war, studierte Physik und war später als Versicherungsmathematiker in Israel tätig.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, Issai Schur visited his daughter in Bern several times. In Zurich he met often with [[George Pólya]], with whom he was on friendly terms since before the First World War.&lt;ref&gt;George Pólya (1887–1985) hatte sich nach seinem Studium in Budapest 1914 und nach Aufenthalten in Göttingen und Paris an der ETH habilitiert. 1928 wurde er zum ordentlichen Professor ernannt. Ab 1940 war er dann in den USA tätig, zuletzt an der Stanford University. – Seine Bekanntschaften mit Schur geht auf die Zeit vor dem Ersten Weltkrieg zurück: Es existieren zahlreiche Briefe von Schur an Pólya aus den Jahren 1913/14, die in den Stanford University Libraries aufbewahrt werden&lt;/ref&gt;

On such a trip to Switzerland in the summer of 1935, a letter reached Schur from [[Ludwig Bieberbach]] signed on behalf of the Rector's, stating that Schur should urgently seek him out in the University of Berlin.&lt;ref&gt;Mitteilung von Frau Susanne Abelin der Enkelin von Issai Schur, Sommer 2001. Der Brief vom 20. August 1935 ist in Walter Ledermann, Peter M. Neumann: The Life of Issai Schur through Letters and other Documents. In Anthony Joseph et al. ''Studies in Memory of Issai Schur'', Birkhäuser 2003. Seite lxxii&lt;/ref&gt; They needed to discuss an important matter with him. It involved Schur's dismissal on September 30, 1935.&lt;ref&gt;Die von Hitler und Göring unterschriebene ''Entpflichtungsurkunde'' datiert vom 28. September 1935. Siehe Walter Ledermann, Peter M. Neumann: The Life of Issai Schur through Letters and other Documents. In Anthony Joseph et al. ''Studies in Memory of Issai Schur'', Birkhäuser 2003. Seite lxxiv. Die Entlassung wäre anhand des [[Reichsbürgergesetz]]es ohnehin spätestens zum 31. Dezember 1935 verfügt worden&lt;/ref&gt;

Schur remained a member of the Prussian Academy of Sciences after his release as a professor, but a little later he lost this last remnant of his official position. Due to an intervention from Bieberbach in the spring of 1938 he was forced to explain his resignation from the commission of the Academy.&lt;ref&gt;Der Vorgang ist beschrieben im Buch von Reinhard Siegmund-Schultze: ''Mathematiker auf der Flucht vor Hitler.'' Dokumente zur Geschichte der Mathematik, Band 10. Deutsche Mathematiker Vereinigung, Vieweg, 1998. Seite 69/70; die Austrittserklärung datiert vom 6. April 1938. Das Buch enthält darüber hinaus weitere interessante Angaben über die Situation von Schur in den dreißiger Jahren&lt;/ref&gt; His membership in the Advisory Board of the Mathematical Journal was ended in early 1939.&lt;ref&gt;Siehe Volker R. Remmert: ''Mathematical Publishing in the Third Reich.'' Math. Intelligencer 22 (3) 2000, Seite 22–30&lt;/ref&gt;

==Emigration==
[[File:Schur tomb.jpg|250px|thumb|Schur's grave at [[Trumpeldor Cemetery]]]]
Schur found himself lonely after the flight of many of his students and the expulsion of renowned scientists from his previous place of work. Only Dr. Helmut Grunsky had been friendly to him, as Schur reported in the late thirties to his expatriate student Max Menachem Schiffer.&lt;ref&gt;"Long after the war, I talked to Grunsky about that remark and he literally started to cry: You know what I did? I sent him a postcard to contratulate him on his sixtieth birthday. I admired him so much and was very respectful in that card. How lonely he must have been to remember such a small thing", Schiffer, Menachem Max; Issai Schur. Some Personal Reminiscences (1986); 1998 in: Begehr, H. (Hrsg.), Mathematik in Berlin. Geschichte und Dokumentation, 1998 Aachen.&lt;/ref&gt; The Gestapo was everywhere. Since Schur had announced to his wife his intentions to commit suicide in case of a summons to the Gestapo,&lt;ref&gt;Siehe dazu und für das Folgende: Alfred Brauers Gedenkrede&lt;/ref&gt; in the summer of 1938 his wife took his letters, and with them a summons from the Gestapo, sent Issai Schur to a relaxing stay in a home outside of Berlin and went with medical certificate allowing her to meet the Gestapo in place of her husband. There they flatly asked why they were still staying in Germany. But there were economic obstacles to the planned emigration: emigrating Germans had a pre-departure Reich Flight Tax to pay, which was a quarter of their assets. Now Schur's wife had inherited a mortgage on a house in Lithuania, which because of the Lithuanian foreign exchange determination could not be repaid. On the other hand, Schur was forbidden to default or leave the mortgage to the German Reich. Thus the Schurs lacked cash and cash equivalents. Finally, the missing sum of money was somehow supplied, and to this day it does not seem to be clear who were the donors.

Schur was able to leave Germany in early 1939.&lt;ref&gt;Vergleiche den Brief des Reichsministers für Wissenschaft, Erziehung und Volksbildung an Issai Schur vom 24. Februar 1939. Walter Ledermann, Peter M. Neumann: The Life of Issai Schur through Letters and other Documents. In Anthony Joseph et al. ''Studies in Memory of Issai Schur'', Birkhäuser 2003. Seite lxxxi&lt;/ref&gt; His health, however, was already severely compromised. He traveled in the company of a nurse to his daughter in Bern, where his wife also followed a few days later. There they remained for several weeks and then emigrated to Palestine.  Two years later, on his 66th birthday, on January 10, 1941, he died in Tel Aviv of a heart attack.

==Work==
Schur continued the work of his teacher Frobenius with many important works for [[group theory]] and [[representation theory]]. In addition, he published important results and elegant proofs of known results in almost all branches of classical algebra and number theory. His collected works&lt;ref&gt;veröffentlicht von Alfred Brauer und Hans Rohrbach&lt;/ref&gt; are an impressive proof of this. There, his work on the theory of integral equations and infinite series can be found.

===Linear groups===
In his doctoral thesis ''Über eine Klasse von Matrizen, die sich einer gegebenen Matrix zuordnen lassen'' Issai Schur determined the polynomial representations of the general linear group &lt;math&gt;GL(n, \mathbb{C})&lt;/math&gt; on the field &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt; of [[complex number]]s. The results and methods of this work are still relevant today.&lt;ref&gt;See Festschrift der DMV Seite 549&lt;/ref&gt; In his book, [[Sandy Green (mathematician)|J.A. Green]] determined the polynomial representations of &lt;math&gt;GL (n, \mathbb{K})&lt;/math&gt; over infinite fields &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{K}&lt;/math&gt; with arbitrary characteristic.&lt;ref&gt;''Polynomial representations of &lt;math&gt;GL(n)&lt;/math&gt;'' {{ISBN|978-0-387-10258-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is mainly based on Schur's dissertation. Green writes, "This remarkable work (of Schur) contained many very original ideas, developed with superb algebraic skill. Schur showed that these (polynomial) representations are completely reducible, that each one is "homogeneous" of some degree &lt;math&gt;r \geq 0&lt;/math&gt;, and that es equivalence types of irreducible polynomial representations of &lt;math&gt;GL_n(\mathbb{C})&lt;/math&gt;, of fixed homogeneous degree &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;, are in one-to-one correspondence with the partitions &lt;math&gt;\lambda = (\lambda_1, \ldots, \lambda_n)&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; into not more than &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; parts. Moreover, Schur showed that the character of an irreducible representation of type &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is given by a certain symmetric function &lt;math&gt;{\underline{S}}_{\lambda}&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; variables, since described as a Schur function.'' According to Green, the methods of Schur's dissertation today are important for the theory of algebraic groups.

In 1927 Schur, in his work ''On the rational representations of the general linear group'', gave new proofs for the main results of his dissertation. If &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is the natural &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt; vector space on which &lt;math&gt;GL(n, \mathbb{C})&lt;/math&gt; operates, and if &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; is a natural number, then the &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;-fold tensor product &lt;math&gt;V^{\otimes r}&lt;/math&gt; over &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt; is a &lt;math&gt;GL(n, \mathbb {C})&lt;/math&gt;-module, on which the symmetric group  &lt;math&gt;S_r&lt;/math&gt; of degree &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; also operates by permutation of the tensor factors of each generator &lt;math&gt;v_1 \otimes \ldots \otimes v_r&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;V^{\otimes r}&lt;/math&gt;. By exploiting these &lt;math&gt;S_r - GL(n, \mathbb{C})&lt;/math&gt;-bimodule actions on &lt;math&gt;V^{\otimes r}&lt;/math&gt;, Schur manages to find elegant proofs of his sentences. This work of Schur was once very well known.

===Professorship in Berlin===
Schur lived in Berlin as a highly respected member of the academic world, an apolitical scholar. A leading mathematician and outstanding and very successful teacher, he held a prestigious chair at the University of Berlin for 16 years.&lt;ref&gt;vgö. Chandler, Bruce; Magnus, Wilhelm.&lt;/ref&gt; Until 1933, his research group had an excellent reputation at the University of Berlin in Germany and beyond. With Schur in the center, his faculty worked with representation theory, which was extended by his students in different directions (including solvable groups, combinatorics, matrix theory).&lt;ref&gt;Briining, Jochen; Ferus, Dirk; Siegmund-Schultze; Reinhard. Terror and Exile: Persecution and Expulsion of Mathematicians from Berlin between 1933 and 1945. An Exhibition on the Occasion of the International Congress of Mathematicians, Technische Universitat Berlin, August 19 to 27, 1998, Deutsche Mathematiker-Vereinigung, Berlin, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;  Schur made fundamental contributions to algebra and group theory which, according to [[Hermann Weyl]], were comparable in scope and depth to those of Emmy Amalie Noether (1882–1935).&lt;ref&gt;Pinl, Max; Furtmiiller, Lux. Mathematicians under Hitler. Seite 178&lt;/ref&gt;

When Schur's lectures were canceled in 1933, there was an outcry among the students and professors who appreciated him and liked him.&lt;ref&gt;vgl. Briining, Jochen Seite 27&lt;/ref&gt; By the efforts of his colleagues [[Erhard Schmidt]] Schur was allowed to continue lecturing until the end of September 1935 for the time being.&lt;ref&gt;Pinl, Max; Furtmiiller, Lux.

===Zurich lecture===
In Switzerland, Schur's colleagues Heinz Hopf and George Pólya were informed of the dismissal of Issai Schur in 1935. They tried to help as best they could.&lt;ref&gt;Urs Stammbach ''Die Zürcher Vorlesung von Issai Schur über Darstellungstheorie'' Seite xiii, ETH-Bibliothek 2004&lt;/ref&gt; On behalf of the Mathematical Seminars chief Michel Plancherel, on December 12, 1935&lt;ref&gt;''Schulratsarchiv der ETH-Zürich.'' Akten 1935/36, ETH-Bibliothek.&lt;/ref&gt; the school board president Arthur Rohn invited Isay Schur to ''une série de conférences sur la théorie de la représentation des groupes finis''. At the same time he asked that the formal invitation should come from President Rohn, ''comme le prof. Schur doit obtenir l'autorisation du ministère compétent de donner ces conférences''. George Pólya arranged from this invitation of the Mathematical Seminars the Conference of the Department of Mathematics and Physics on December 16.&lt;ref&gt;''Protokoller der Abteilung IX, Mathematik und Physik.'' Protokolle der Konferenzen der Abt. IX, Hs 1079:3, Handschriften und Nachlässe, ETH-Bibliothek Zürich&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, on 14 December the official invitation letter from President Rohn had already been dispatched to Issai Schur.&lt;ref&gt;''Schulratsarchiv der ETH-Zürich.'' Missiven 1935, 3119, ETH-Bibliothek&lt;/ref&gt; Schur was promised for his guest lecture a fee of CHF 500.

Schur did not reply until January 28, 1936, on which day he was first in the possession of the required approval of the local authority.&lt;ref&gt;''Schulratsarchiv der ETH-Zürich.'' Akten 1935/36, ETH-Bibliothek&lt;/ref&gt; He declared himself willing to accept the invitation. He envisaged beginning the lecture on 4 February.&lt;ref&gt;Gemäß einem später geschriebenen Lebenslauf – siehe Walter Ledermann, Peter M. Neumann: The Life of Issai Schur through Letters and other Documents. In Anthony Joseph et al. ''Studies in Memory of Issai Schur.'' Seite lxxvii, Birkhäuser 2003. – fanden die Vorlesungen zwischen dem 4. und dem 18. Februar statt&lt;/ref&gt; Schur spent most of the month of February in Switzerland. Before his return to Germany he visited his daughter in Bern for a few days, and on 27 February he returned via Karlsruhe, where his sister lived, to Berlin. In a letter to Pólya from Berne, he concludes with the words: ''From Switzerland I take farewell with a heavy heart''.&lt;ref&gt;Siehe Department of Special Collections and University Archives, Stanford University Libraries, 26. Februar 1936.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Berlin, meanwhile, Ludwig Bieberbach, in a letter dated February 20, 1936, informed the Reich Minister for Science, Art, and Education on the journey of Schur, and announced that he wanted to find out what was the content of the lecture in Zurich.&lt;ref&gt;Der Vorgang wird beschrieben in Charles Curtis: ''Pioneers of representation theory.'' History of Mathematics vol. 15, Amer. Math. Soc./London Math. Soc. 1999, Seite 131&lt;/ref&gt;

===Quotes===
In his commemorative speech, Alfred Brauer (PhD candidate Schur) spoke about Issai Schur as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Gedenkrede vom 8. November 1960 anlässlich der Schur-Gedenkfeier im Rahmen der 150-Jahrfeier der Universität Berlin. Siehe Issai Schur: Gesammelte Abhandlungen, Seiten v–xiv. Alfred Brauer hat 1928 bei Schur promoviert.&lt;/ref&gt; ''As a teacher, Schur was excellent. His lectures were very clear, but not always easy and required cooperation – During the winter semester of 1930, the number of students who wanted to attend Schur's theory of numbers lecture, was such that the second largest university lecture hall with about 500 seats was too small. His most human characteristics were probably his great modesty, his helpfulness and his human interest in his students.''

Heinz Hopf, who had been in Berlin before his appointment to Zurich at the ETH Privatdozent, held – as is clear from oral statements and also from letters – Issai Schur as a mathematician and greatly appreciated man. Here, this appreciation was based entirely on reciprocity: in a letter of 1930 to George Pólya on the occasion of the re-appointment of Hermann Weyl, Schur says of Hopf: ''Hopf is a very excellent teacher, a mathematician of strong temperament and strong effect, a master's discipline, trained excellent in other areas. – If I have to characterize him as a man, it may suffice if I say that I sincerely look forward to each time I meet with him''.

Schur was, however, known for putting a correct distance in personal affairs. The testimony of Hopf is in accordance with statements of Schur's former students in Berlin, by Walter Ledermann and Bernhard Neumann.&lt;ref&gt;Siehe ''Interview with Bernhard Neumann'', [[Newsletter of the European Mathematical Society]], 39, March 2001, 9–11; Walter Ledermann: ''Issai Schur and his school in Berlin'', Bull. London Math. Soc. 15 (1983), 97–106. Bernhard Neumann doktorierte 1932, Walter Ledermann bestand das Examen für Lehramtskandidaten im Jahre 1933&lt;/ref&gt;

He made many contributions to the science of [[photography]], and investigated [[colour blindness]] and the chemical power of [[ultraviolet]] rays; his ''Preliminary Discourse'' (1831), which advocated an [[Inductive reasoning|inductive approach]] to scientific experiment and theory building, was an important contribution to the philosophy of science.{{sfn|Cobb|2012|pp=409-439}}

== Early life and work on astronomy ==
[[File:Lunar Copernicus crater - Herschel 1842.jpg|thumb|left|A [[Calotype]] of a model of the lunar crater Copernicus, 1842]]

Herschel was born in [[Slough]], [[Buckinghamshire]], the son of Mary Baldwin and [[William Herschel]].  He was the nephew of astronomer [[Caroline Herschel]]. He studied shortly at [[Eton College]] and [[St John's College, Cambridge]], graduating as [[Senior Wrangler]] in 1813.&lt;ref name="Venn" /&gt; It was during his time as an undergraduate that he became friends with the mathematicians [[Charles Babbage]] and [[George Peacock]].&lt;ref name=HersNAH/&gt;  He left Cambridge in 1816 and started working with his father. He took up astronomy in 1816, building a reflecting telescope with a mirror {{convert|18|in|mm}} in diameter, and with a {{convert|20|ft|m|adj=on}} focal length. Between 1821 and 1823 he re-examined, with [[James South]], the double stars catalogued by his father.&lt;ref name="EB1911" /&gt;  He was one of the founders of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1820. For his work with his father, he was presented with the [[Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society]] in 1826 (which he won again in 1836), and with the [[Lalande Medal]] of the [[French Academy of Sciences]] in 1825, while in 1821 the [[Royal Society]] bestowed upon him the [[Copley Medal]] for his mathematical contributions to their Transactions. Herschel was made a Knight of the [[Royal Guelphic Order]] in 1831.&lt;ref name=HersNAH/&gt;

He served as [[President of the Royal Astronomical Society]] three times: 1827–29, 1839–41 and 1847–49.&lt;ref name="RoyAstrSoc" /&gt;{{sfn |Dreyer |Turner |2014|p=250}}

His ''A preliminary discourse on the study of natural philosophy'', published early in 1831 as part of ''[[Dionysius Lardner's Cabinet cyclopædia]]'', set out methods of scientific investigation with an orderly relationship between observation and theorising. He described nature as being governed by laws which were difficult to discern or to state mathematically, and the highest aim of [[natural philosophy]] was understanding these laws through [[inductive reasoning]], finding a single unifying explanation for a phenomenon. This became an authoritative statement with wide influence on science, particularly at the [[University of Cambridge]] where it inspired the student [[Charles Darwin]] with "a burning zeal" to contribute to this work.{{sfn|Darwin|1958|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1497&amp;pageseq=69 67–68]}}{{sfn|Browne|1995|pp=128, 133}}{{sfn|Darwin|1985a|loc=[http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/letter/DCP-LETT-94.xml#mark-94.f2 Letter No. 94]}}

Herschel published a catalogue of his astronomical observations in 1864, as the ''[[General Catalogue of Nebulae and Clusters]]'', a compilation of his own work and that of his father's, expanding on the senior Herschel's ''[[Catalogue of Nebulae]]''. A further complementary volume was published posthumously, as the ''General Catalogue of 10,300 Multiple and Double Stars''.

Herschel correctly considered astigmatism to be due to irregularity of the cornea and theorised that vision could be improved by the application of some animal jelly contained in a capsule of glass against the cornea. His views were published in an article entitled Light in 1828 and the ''Encyclopædia Metropolitana'' in 1845.&lt;ref name="anti_Cont" /&gt;

[[File:Disa cornuta00.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Disa cornuta]] (L.) Sw.'' by Margaret &amp; John Herschel]]

Declining an offer from the [[Duke of Sussex]] that they travel to South Africa on a Navy ship, Herschel and his wife paid £500 for passage on the S.S. ''Mountstuart Elphinstone'', which departed from Portsmouth on 13 November 1833.

The voyage to South Africa was made in order to catalogue the stars, nebulae, and other objects of the southern skies.&lt;ref name=HersNAH/&gt; This was to be a completion as well as extension of the survey of the northern heavens undertaken initially by his father [[William Herschel]]. He arrived in [[Cape Town]] on 15 January 1834 and set up a private {{convert|21|ft|m|abbr=on}} telescope at Feldhausen at Claremont, a suburb of Cape Town. Amongst his other observations during this time was that of the return of [[Comet Halley]]. Herschel collaborated with [[Thomas Maclear]], the Astronomer Royal at the Cape of Good Hope and the members of the two families became close friends. During this time, he also witnessed the Great Eruption of [[Eta Carinae]] (December, 1837).

In addition to his astronomical work, however, this voyage to a far corner of the British empire also gave Herschel an escape from the pressures under which he found himself in London, where he was one of the most sought-after of all British men of science. While in southern Africa, he engaged in a broad variety of scientific pursuits free from a sense of strong obligations to a larger scientific community. It was, he later recalled, probably the happiest time in his life.

In an extraordinary departure from astronomy, he combined his talents with those of his wife, Margaret, and between 1834 and 1838 they produced 131 botanical illustrations of fine quality, showing the Cape flora. Herschel used a [[camera lucida]] to obtain accurate outlines of the specimens and left the details to his wife. Even though their portfolio had been intended as a personal record, and despite the lack of floral dissections in the paintings, their accurate rendition makes them more valuable than many contemporary collections. Some 112 of the 132 known flower studies were collected and published as ''Flora Herscheliana'' in 1996.

As their home during their stay in the Cape, the Herschels had selected 'Feldhausen' ("Field Houses"), an old estate on the south-eastern side of [[Table Mountain]]. Here John set up his reflector to begin his survey of the southern skies.

Herschel, at the same time, read widely. Intrigued by the ideas of gradual formation of landscapes set out in [[Charles Lyell]]'s ''Principles of Geology'', he wrote to Lyell on 20 February 1836 praising the book as a work that would bring "a complete revolution in [its] subject, by altering entirely the point of view in which it must thenceforward be contemplated" and opening a way for bold speculation on "that mystery of mysteries, the replacement of extinct species by others." Herschel himself thought [[catastrophism|catastrophic extinction and renewal]] "an inadequate conception of the Creator" and by analogy with other [[Physical law|intermediate causes]], "the origination of fresh species, could it ever come under our cognizance, would be found to be a natural in contradistinction to a miraculous process".{{sfn|van Wyhe|2007|p=197}}{{sfn|Babbage|1838|pp=225–227}} He prefaced his words with the couplet:

{{poemquote|He that on such quest would go must know not fear or failing
To coward soul or faithless heart the search were unavailing.}}

Taking a gradualist view of development and referring to the evolution of language, he commented: 

{{quote|Words are to the Anthropologist what rolled pebbles are to the Geologist — battered relics of past ages often containing within them indelible records capable of intelligent interpretation — and when we see what amount of change 2000 years has been able to produce in the languages of Greece &amp; Italy or 1000 in those of Germany France &amp; Spain we naturally begin to ask how long a period must have lapsed since the Chinese, the Hebrew, the Delaware &amp; the Malesass [Malagasy] had a point in common with the German &amp; Italian &amp; each other — Time! Time! Time! — we must not impugn the Scripture Chronology, but we ''must'' interpret it in accordance with ''whatever'' shall appear on fair enquiry to be the ''truth'' for there cannot be two truths. And really there is scope enough: for the lives of the Patriarchs may as reasonably be extended to 5000 or 50000 years apiece as the days of Creation to as many thousand millions of years.{{sfn|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp=214–215}}{{sfn|Darwin|1985b|loc=[http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/letter/DCP-LETT-346.xml#mark-346.f5 Letter No. 346]}} }}

The document was circulated, and [[Charles Babbage]] incorporated extracts in his ninth and unofficial ''[[Bridgewater Treatise]]'', which postulated laws set up by a divine programmer.{{sfn|van Wyhe|2007|p=197}} When [[The Voyage of the Beagle|HMS ''Beagle'']] called at [[Cape Town]], Captain [[Robert FitzRoy]] and the young naturalist [[Charles Darwin]] visited Herschel on 3 June 1836. Later on, Darwin would be influenced by Herschel's writings in developing his theory advanced in ''[[The Origin of Species]]''. In the opening lines of that work, Darwin writes that his intent is "to throw some light on the origin of species — that mystery of mysteries, as it has been called by one of our greatest philosophers," referring to Herschel.  However, Herschel ultimately rejected the theory of natural selection.&lt;ref&gt;John Herschel, ''Physical Geography'' (1861), p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Herschel returned to England in 1838, was created a [[Herschel baronets|baronet]], of Slough in the County of Buckingham,&lt;ref name=HersNAH/&gt; and published ''Results of Astronomical Observations made at the Cape of Good Hope'' in 1847. In this publication he proposed the names still used today for the seven then-known satellites of [[Saturn]]: [[Mimas (moon)|Mimas]], [[Enceladus]], [[Tethys (moon)|Tethys]], [[Dione (moon)|Dione]], [[Rhea (moon)|Rhea]], [[Titan (moon)|Titan]], and [[Iapetus (moon)|Iapetus]].{{sfn|Lassell|1848|p=}} In the same year, Herschel received his second Copley Medal from the Royal Society for this work.  A few years later, in 1852, he proposed the names still used today for the four then-known satellites of [[Uranus]]: [[Ariel (moon)|Ariel]], [[Umbriel (moon)|Umbriel]], [[Titania (moon)|Titania]], and [[Oberon (moon)|Oberon]].

Herschel made numerous important contributions to photography.  He made improvements in [[photographic processes]], particularly in inventing the [[cyanotype]]&lt;ref name="WDL1" /&gt; process, which became known as [[blueprint]]s.&lt;ref name="EncycBrit" /&gt;&lt;ref name="columbia" /&gt;&lt;ref name="vernacu"/&gt; and variations, such as the [[chrysotype]]. In 1839, he made a photograph on glass, which still exists, and experimented with some color reproduction, noting that rays of different parts of the spectrum tended to impart their own color to a photographic paper. Herschel made experiments using photosensitive emulsions of vegetable juices, called [[phytotype]]s, also known as [[anthotype]]s, and published his discoveries in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London in 1842.{{sfn|Herschel|1842|pp=182-214}}  He collaborated in the early 1840s with [[Henry Collen]], portrait painter to Queen Victoria.  Herschel originally discovered the platinum process on the basis of the light sensitivity of platinum salts, later developed by [[William Willis (inventor)|William Willis]].&lt;ref name= "KNAW" /&gt;

Herschel coined the term ''photography'' in 1839.{{sfn|Schaaf|1979|pp=47–60}}{{sfn|Peres|2008|p=}} Herschel was also the first to apply the terms ''negative'' and ''positive'' to photography.&lt;ref name=HersNAH/&gt;

He discovered [[sodium thiosulfate]] to be a solvent of silver [[halide]]s in 1819,{{sfn|Herschel|1819|p=}} and informed [[Henry Fox Talbot|Talbot]] and [[Louis Daguerre|Daguerre]] of his discovery that this "hyposulphite of soda" ("hypo") could be used as a [[photographic fixer]], to "fix" pictures and make them permanent, after experimentally applying it thus in early 1839.

His ground-breaking research on the subject was read at the Royal Society in London in March 1839 and January 1840.

Herschel wrote many papers and articles, including entries on meteorology, physical geography and the telescope for the eighth edition of the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]''.&lt;ref name=HersNAH/&gt; He also translated the ''[[Iliad]]'' of Homer.
{{further|English translations of Homer#Herschel}}

He invented the [[actinometer]] in 1825 to measure the direct heating power of the sun's rays,{{sfn|Anon|1884|p=527}} and his work with the instrument is of great importance in the early history of [[photochemistry]].

He proposed a correction to the Gregorian calendar, making years that are multiples of 4000 not leap years, thus reducing the average length of the [[calendar year]] from 365.2425 days to 365.24225.{{sfn|Herschel | 1876|p=712}} Although this is closer to the [[mean tropical year]] of 365.24219 days, his proposal has never been adopted because the Gregorian calendar is based on the mean time between vernal [[equinox]]es (currently {{gaps|365.242|374}} days).{{sfn|Steel|2000|p=185}}

Herschel was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1832,&lt;ref name="AAAS" /&gt; and in 1836, a foreign member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]].

In 1835, the ''[[New York Sun (historical)|New York Sun]]'' newspaper wrote a series of satiric articles that came to be known as the [[Great Moon Hoax]], with statements falsely attributed to Herschel about his supposed discoveries of animals living on the Moon, including batlike winged humanoids.

The village of Herschel in western Saskatchewan Canada, [[Mount Herschel]] Antarctica, the crater [[J. Herschel (crater)|J. Herschel]] on the Moon, and the [[Herschel Girls' School]] in [[Cape Town]] South Africa, are all named after him.

While it is commonly accepted that Herschel Island, in the Arctic Ocean, part of the [[Yukon Territory]], was named after him, the entries in the expedition journal of Sir [[John Franklin]] state that the latter wished to honour the Herschel family, of which John Herschel's father, Sir [[William Herschel]], and his aunt, [[Caroline Herschel]], are as notable as John.{{sfn|Burn|2009|pp=317–323}}

Herschel died on 11 May 1871 at age 79 at Collingwood, his home near [[Hawkhurst]] in Kent.  On his death, he was given a national funeral and buried in [[Westminster Abbey]].&lt;ref name="ODNB" /&gt; His obituary by [[Henry W Field]] of London was read to the [[American Philosophical Society]] on 1 December 1871.{{sfn|Field|1871|pp=217-223}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="39957">[[File:Jordan blocks.svg|right|thumb|250px|An example of a matrix in Jordan normal form. The grey blocks are called Jordan blocks.]]
In [[linear algebra]], a '''Jordan normal form''' (often called '''Jordan canonical form''')&lt;ref&gt;
Shilov defines the term ''Jordan canonical form'' and in a footnote says that ''Jordan normal form'' is synonymous.
These terms are sometimes shortened to ''Jordan form''. (Shilov)
The term ''Classical canonical form'' is also sometimes used in the sense of this article. (James &amp; James, 1976)
&lt;/ref&gt;
of a [[linear operator]] on a [[finite-dimensional]] [[vector space]] is an [[upper triangular matrix]] of a particular form called a [[Jordan matrix]], representing the operator with respect to some [[Basis (linear algebra)|basis]]. Such a matrix has each non-zero off-diagonal entry equal to&amp;nbsp;1, immediately above the main diagonal (on the [[superdiagonal]]), and with identical diagonal entries to the left and below them.

Let ''V'' be a vector space over a [[field (mathematics)|field]] ''K''. Then a basis with respect to which the matrix has the required form exists [[if and only if]] all [[eigenvalue]]s of the matrix lie in ''K'', or equivalently if the [[characteristic polynomial]] of the operator splits into linear factors over ''K''. This condition is always satisfied if ''K'' is [[algebraically closed]] (for instance, if it is the field of [[complex number]]s). The diagonal entries of the normal form are the eigenvalues (of the operator), and the number of times each eigenvalue occurs is called the [[algebraic multiplicity]] of the eigenvalue.&lt;ref name="Beauregard 1973 310–316"&gt;{{harvtxt|Beauregard|Fraleigh|1973|pp=310–316}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Golub 1996 354"&gt;{{harvtxt|Golub|Van Loan|1996|p=355}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nering 1970 118–127"&gt;{{harvtxt|Nering|1970|pp=118–127}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the operator is originally given by a [[square matrix]] ''M'', then its Jordan normal form is also called the Jordan normal form of ''M''. Any square matrix has a Jordan normal form if the field of coefficients is extended to one containing all the eigenvalues of the matrix. In spite of its name, the normal form for a given ''M'' is not entirely unique, as it is a [[block diagonal matrix]] formed of [[Jordan block]]s, the order of which is not fixed; it is conventional to group blocks for the same eigenvalue together, but no ordering is imposed among the eigenvalues, nor among the blocks for a given eigenvalue, although the latter could for instance be ordered by weakly decreasing size.&lt;ref name="Beauregard 1973 310–316"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Golub 1996 354"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nering 1970 118–127"/&gt;

The [[Jordan–Chevalley decomposition]] is particularly simple with respect to a basis for which the operator takes its Jordan normal form. The diagonal form for [[diagonalizable]] matrices, for instance [[normal matrix|normal matrices]], is a special case of the Jordan normal form.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Beauregard|Fraleigh|1973|pp=270–274}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Golub|Van Loan|1996|p=353}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Nering|1970|pp=113–118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jordan normal form is named after [[Camille Jordan]], who first stated the Jordan decomposition theorem in 1870.&lt;ref name="Brechenmacher-thesis"&gt;Brechenmacher, [https://tel.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-00142786 "Histoire du théorème de Jordan de la décomposition matricielle (1870-1930). Formes de représentation et méthodes de décomposition"], Thesis, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
=== Notation ===
Some textbooks have the ones on the [[subdiagonal]], i.e., immediately below the main diagonal instead of on the superdiagonal.  The eigenvalues are still on the main diagonal.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Cullen|1966|p=114}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Franklin|1968|p=122}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Motivation ===
An ''n'' &amp;times; ''n'' matrix ''A'' is [[diagonalizable matrix|diagonalizable]] if and only if the sum of the dimensions of the eigenspaces is ''n''. Or, equivalently, if and only if ''A'' has ''n'' [[linearly independent]] [[eigenvectors]]. Not all matrices are diagonalizable. Consider the following matrix:

&lt;math&gt;A=
\left[\!\!\!\begin{array}{*{20}{r}}
  5 &amp;  4 &amp;  2 &amp;  1 \\[2pt]
  0 &amp;  1 &amp; -1 &amp; -1 \\[2pt]
 -1 &amp; -1 &amp;  3 &amp;  0 \\[2pt]
  1 &amp;  1 &amp; -1 &amp;  2
\end{array}\!\!\right].&lt;/math&gt;

Including multiplicity, the eigenvalues of ''A'' are λ = 1, 2, 4, 4. The [[Hamel dimension|dimension]] of the eigenspace corresponding to the eigenvalue 4 is 1 (and not 2), so ''A'' is not diagonalizable. However, there is an invertible matrix ''P'' such that ''A'' = ''PJP''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;, where

:&lt;math&gt;J = \begin{bmatrix}
1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\[2pt]
0 &amp; 2 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\[2pt]
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 4 &amp; 1 \\[2pt]
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 4 \end{bmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;

The matrix J is almost diagonal. This is the Jordan normal form of ''A''. The section [[#Example|''Example'']] below fills in the details of the computation.

== Complex matrices ==

In general, a square complex matrix ''A'' is [[similar (linear algebra)|similar]] to a [[block diagonal matrix]]

:&lt;math&gt;J = \begin{bmatrix}
J_1 &amp; \;     &amp; \; \\
\;  &amp; \ddots &amp; \; \\ 
\;  &amp; \;     &amp; J_p\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

where each block ''J''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; is a square matrix of the form

:&lt;math&gt;J_i = 
\begin{bmatrix}
\lambda_i &amp; 1            &amp; \;     &amp; \;  \\
\;        &amp; \lambda_i    &amp; \ddots &amp; \;  \\
\;        &amp; \;           &amp; \ddots &amp; 1   \\
\;        &amp; \;           &amp; \;     &amp; \lambda_i       
\end{bmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;
 
So there exists an invertible matrix ''P'' such that ''P&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;AP'' = ''J'' is such that the only non-zero entries of ''J'' are on the diagonal and the superdiagonal. ''J'' is called the '''Jordan normal form''' of ''A''. Each ''J''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is called a [[Jordan block]] of ''A''. In a given Jordan block, every entry on the superdiagonal is 1.

Assuming this result, we can deduce the following properties:

* Counting multiplicity, the eigenvalues of ''J'', therefore ''A'', are the diagonal entries.
* Given an eigenvalue λ&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, its '''[[geometric multiplicity]]''' is the dimension of Ker(''A'' &amp;minus; λ&lt;sub&gt;''i'' &lt;/sub&gt;'''[[identity matrix|I]]'''), and it is the number of Jordan blocks corresponding to λ&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name="HJp321"&gt;{{harvtxt|Horn|Johnson|1985|loc=§3.2.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The sum of the sizes of all Jordan blocks corresponding to an eigenvalue λ&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is its '''[[algebraic multiplicity]]'''.&lt;ref name="HJp321" /&gt;
* ''A'' is diagonalizable if and only if, for every eigenvalue λ of ''A'', its geometric and algebraic multiplicities coincide.
* The Jordan block corresponding to λ is of the form λ '''I''' + ''N'', where ''N'' is a [[nilpotent matrix]] defined as ''N''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt; = δ&lt;sub&gt;''i'',''j''&amp;minus;1&lt;/sub&gt; (where δ is the [[Kronecker delta]]). The nilpotency of ''N'' can be exploited when calculating ''f''(''A'') where ''f'' is a complex analytic function. For example, in principle the Jordan form could give a closed-form expression for the exponential exp(''A'').
* The number of Jordan blocks corresponding to λ of size at least ''j'' is dim Ker(''A - λI)&lt;sup&gt;j&lt;/sup&gt; -'' dim Ker''(A - λI)&lt;sup&gt;j-1&lt;/sup&gt;''. Thus, the number of Jordan blocks of size exactly ''j'' is
:&lt;math&gt;2 \dim \ker (A - \lambda_i I)^j - \dim \ker (A - \lambda_i I)^{j+1} - \dim \ker (A - \lambda_i I)^{j-1}&lt;/math&gt;
* Given an eigenvalue λ&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, its multiplicity in the minimal polynomial is the size of its largest Jordan block.

=== Generalized eigenvectors ===
{{main|Generalized eigenvector}}
Consider the matrix ''A'' from the example in the previous section. The Jordan normal form is obtained by some similarity transformation ''P''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;''AP'' = ''J'', i.e.,

:&lt;math&gt;\; AP = PJ.&lt;/math&gt;

Let ''P'' have column vectors ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''i'' = 1, ..., 4, then

: &lt;math&gt;A \begin{bmatrix} p_1 &amp; p_2 &amp; p_3 &amp; p_4 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} p_1 &amp; p_2 &amp; p_3 &amp; p_4 \end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 2 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 4 &amp; 1 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 4 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} p_1 &amp; 2p_2 &amp; 4p_3 &amp; p_3+4p_4 \end{bmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;

We see that
:&lt;math&gt;\; (A - 1 I) p_1 = 0 &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\; (A - 2 I) p_2 = 0 &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\; (A - 4 I) p_3 = 0 &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\; (A - 4 I) p_4 = p_3. &lt;/math&gt;

For ''i'' = 1,2,3 we have &lt;math&gt;p_i \in \operatorname{Ker}(A-\lambda_{i} I)&lt;/math&gt;, i.e., ''p''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; is an eigenvector of ''A'' corresponding to the eigenvalue λ&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;. For ''i''=4, multiplying both sides by &lt;math&gt;(A-4I)&lt;/math&gt; gives
:&lt;math&gt;\; (A-4I)^2 p_4 = (A-4I) p_3. &lt;/math&gt;
But &lt;math&gt;(A-4I)p_3 = 0&lt;/math&gt;, so
:&lt;math&gt;\; (A-4I)^2 p_4 = 0. &lt;/math&gt;
Thus, &lt;math&gt;p_4 \in \operatorname{Ker}(A-4 I)^2.&lt;/math&gt;

Vectors such as &lt;math&gt;p_4&lt;/math&gt; are called [[generalized eigenvector]]s of ''A''.

Thus, given an eigenvalue λ, its corresponding Jordan block gives rise to a '''[[Jordan chain]]'''. The '''generator''', or '''lead vector''', say ''p&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;'', of the chain is a generalized eigenvector such that (''A'' &amp;minus; λ '''I''')&lt;sup&gt;''r''&lt;/sup&gt;''p''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt; = 0, where ''r'' is the size of the Jordan block. The vector ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; =  (''A'' &amp;minus; λ '''I''')&lt;sup&gt;''r''&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;''p''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt; is an eigenvector corresponding to λ. In general, ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is a preimage of ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&amp;minus;1&lt;/sub&gt; under ''A'' &amp;minus; λ '''I'''. So the lead vector generates the chain via multiplication by (''A'' &amp;minus; λ '''I''').&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Bronson|1970|pp=189,194}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Holt|Rumynin|2009|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Therefore, the statement that every square matrix ''A'' can be put in Jordan normal form is equivalent to the claim that there exists a basis consisting only of eigenvectors and generalized eigenvectors of ''A''.

=== A proof ===
{{multiple issues|section=yes|{{disputed section|date=October 2017}}{{unreferenced section|date=October 2017}}}}
We give a proof by induction that any complex-valued matrix A may be put in Jordan normal form. The 1 &amp;times; 1 case is trivial. Let ''A'' be an ''n'' &amp;times; ''n'' matrix. Take any eigenvalue λ of ''A''. The range of ''A'' &amp;minus; λ '''I''', denoted by Ran(''A'' &amp;minus; λ '''I'''), is an [[invariant subspace]] of ''A''. Also, since λ is an eigenvalue of ''A'', the dimension of Ran(''A'' &amp;minus; λ '''I'''), ''r'', is strictly less than ''n''. Let ''A' '' denote the restriction of ''A'' to Ran(''A'' &amp;minus; λ '''I'''), By inductive hypothesis, there exists a basis {''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt;} such that ''A' '', expressed with respect to this basis, is in Jordan normal form.

Next consider the subspace Ker(''A'' &amp;minus; λ '''I'''). If

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Ran}(A - \lambda I) \cap \mathrm{Ker}(A - \lambda I) = \{0\},&lt;/math&gt;

the desired result follows immediately from the [[rank–nullity theorem]]. This would be the case, for example, if ''A'' was Hermitian.

Otherwise, if

:&lt;math&gt;Q = \mathrm{Ran}(A - \lambda I) \cap \mathrm{Ker}(A - \lambda I) \neq \{0\},&lt;/math&gt;

let the dimension of ''Q'' be ''s'' ≤ ''r''. Each vector in ''Q'' is an eigenvector of ''A' '' corresponding to eigenvalue ''λ''. So the Jordan form of ''A' '' must contain ''s'' Jordan chains corresponding to ''s'' linearly independent eigenvectors. So the basis {''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt;} must contain ''s'' vectors, say {''p''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&amp;minus;''s''+1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt;}, that are lead vectors in these Jordan chains from the Jordan normal form of ''A'''. We can "extend the chains" by taking the preimages of these lead vectors. (This is the key step of argument; in general, generalized eigenvectors need not lie in Ran(''A'' &amp;minus; λ '''I''').) Let ''q''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; be such that

:&lt;math&gt;\; (A - \lambda I) q_i = p_i \mbox{ for } i = r-s+1, \ldots, r.&lt;/math&gt;

Clearly no non-trivial linear combination of the ''q''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; can lie in Ker(''A'' &amp;minus; λ I). Furthermore, no non-trivial linear combination of the ''q''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; can be in Ran(''A'' &amp;minus; λ '''I'''), for that would contradict the assumption that each ''p&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' is a lead vector in a Jordan chain. The set {''q''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}, being preimages of the linearly independent set {''p''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;} under ''A'' &amp;minus; λ '''I''', is also linearly independent.

Finally, we can pick any linearly independent set {''z''&lt;sub&gt;''1''&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''z''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt;} that spans

:&lt;math&gt;\; \mathrm{Ker}(A - \lambda I) / Q.&lt;/math&gt;

By construction, the union of the three sets {''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt;}, {''q''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&amp;minus;''s'' +1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''q''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt;}, and  {''z''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''z''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt;} is linearly independent. Each vector in the union is either an eigenvector or a generalized eigenvector of ''A''. Finally, by the rank–nullity theorem, the cardinality of the union is ''n''. In other words, we have found a basis that consists of eigenvectors and generalized eigenvectors of ''A'', and this shows ''A'' can be put in Jordan normal form.

=== Uniqueness ===

It can be shown that the Jordan normal form of a given matrix ''A'' is unique up to the order of the Jordan blocks.

Knowing the algebraic and geometric multiplicities of the eigenvalues is not sufficient to determine the Jordan normal form of ''A''. Assuming the algebraic multiplicity ''m''(λ) of an eigenvalue λ is known, the structure of the Jordan form can be ascertained by analyzing the ranks of the powers (''A'' &amp;minus; λ I)&lt;sup&gt;''m''(λ)&lt;/sup&gt;. To see this, suppose an ''n'' &amp;times; ''n'' matrix ''A'' has only one eigenvalue λ. So ''m''(λ) = ''n''. The smallest integer ''k''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; such that

:&lt;math&gt;(A - \lambda I)^{k_1} = 0&lt;/math&gt;

is the size of the largest Jordan block in the Jordan form of ''A''. (This number ''k''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is also called the '''index''' of λ. See discussion in a following section.) The rank of

:&lt;math&gt;(A - \lambda I)^{k_1 - 1}&lt;/math&gt;

is the number of Jordan blocks of size ''k''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. Similarly, the rank of

:&lt;math&gt;(A - \lambda I)^{k_1 - 2}&lt;/math&gt;

is twice the number of Jordan blocks of size ''k''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; plus the number of Jordan blocks of size ''k''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;minus;1. The general case is similar.

This can be used to show the uniqueness of the Jordan form. Let ''J''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''J''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; be two Jordan normal forms of ''A''. Then ''J''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''J''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are similar and have the same spectrum, including algebraic multiplicities of the eigenvalues. The procedure outlined in the previous paragraph can be used to determine the structure of these matrices. Since the rank of a matrix is preserved by similarity transformation, there is a bijection between the Jordan blocks of ''J''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''J''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. This proves the uniqueness part of the statement.

== Real matrices ==
If ''A'' is a real matrix, its Jordan form can still be non-real. Instead of representing it with complex eigenvalues and 1's on the superdiagonal, as discussed above, there exists a real invertible matrix ''P'' such that ''P&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;AP'' = ''J'' is a real [[block diagonal matrix]] with each block being a real Jordan block.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Horn|Johnson|1985|loc=Theorem 3.4.5}}&lt;/ref&gt; A real Jordan block is either identical to a complex Jordan block (if the corresponding eigenvalue &lt;math&gt;\lambda_i&lt;/math&gt; is real), or is a block matrix itself, consisting of 2&amp;times;2 blocks (for non-real eigenvalue &lt;math&gt;\lambda_i = a_i+ib_i&lt;/math&gt; with given algebraic multiplicity) of the form

:&lt;math&gt;C_i = 
\begin{bmatrix}
a_i  &amp; b_i \\
-b_i &amp; a_i \\ 
\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

and describe multiplication by &lt;math&gt;\lambda_i&lt;/math&gt; in the complex plane. The superdiagonal blocks are 2&amp;times;2 identity matrices and hence in this representation the matrix dimensions are larger than the complex Jordan form. The full real Jordan block is given by

:&lt;math&gt;J_i = 
\begin{bmatrix}
C_i    &amp; I       &amp; \;     &amp; \;    \\
\;     &amp; C_i     &amp; \ddots &amp; \;    \\     
\;     &amp; \;      &amp; \ddots &amp; I     \\
\;     &amp; \;      &amp; \;     &amp; C_i   \\
\end{bmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;

This real Jordan form is a consequence of the complex Jordan form. For a real matrix the nonreal eigenvectors and generalized eigenvectors can always be chosen to form [[complex conjugate]] pairs. Taking the real and imaginary part (linear combination of the vector and its conjugate), the matrix has this form with respect to the new basis.

== Consequences ==

One can see that the Jordan normal form is essentially a classification result for square matrices, and as such several important results from linear algebra can be viewed as its consequences.

=== Spectral mapping theorem ===

Using the Jordan normal form, direct calculation gives a spectral mapping theorem for the [[functional calculus|polynomial functional calculus]]: Let ''A'' be an ''n'' &amp;times; ''n'' matrix with eigenvalues λ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., λ&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, then for any polynomial ''p'', ''p''(''A'') has eigenvalues ''p''(λ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;), ..., ''p''(λ&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;).

=== Cayley–Hamilton theorem ===

The [[Cayley–Hamilton theorem]] asserts that every matrix ''A'' satisfies its characteristic equation: if {{math|''p''}} is the [[characteristic polynomial]] of {{math|''A''}}, then {{math|''p''(''A'') {{=}} 0}}. This can be shown via direct calculation in the Jordan form, since any Jordan block for {{math|''&amp;lambda;''}} is annihilated by {{math|(''X'' − &amp;lambda;)&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt;}} where {{math|''m''}} is the multiplicity of the root {{math|''&amp;lambda;''}} of {{math|''p''}}, the sum of the sizes of the Jordan blocks for {{math|''&amp;lambda;''}}, and therefore no less than the size of the block in question. The Jordan form can be assumed to exist over a field extending the base field of the matrix, for instance over the [[splitting field]] of {{math|''p''}}; this field extension does not change the matrix {{math|''p''(''A'')}} in any way.

=== Minimal polynomial ===

The [[Minimal polynomial (linear algebra)|minimal polynomial]] P of a square matrix ''A'' is the unique [[monic polynomial]] of least degree, ''m'', such that ''P''(''A'') = 0. Alternatively, the set of polynomials that annihilate a given ''A'' form an ideal ''I'' in ''C''[''x''], the [[principal ideal domain]] of polynomials with complex coefficients. The monic element that generates ''I'' is precisely ''P''.

Let λ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., λ&lt;sub&gt;''q''&lt;/sub&gt; be the distinct eigenvalues of ''A'', and ''s''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; be the size of the largest Jordan block corresponding to λ&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;. It is clear from the Jordan normal form that the minimal polynomial of ''A'' has degree {{math|''&amp;Sigma;''}}''s''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;.

While the Jordan normal form determines the minimal polynomial, the converse is not true. This leads to the notion of '''elementary divisors'''. The elementary divisors of a square matrix ''A'' are the characteristic polynomials of its Jordan blocks. The factors of the minimal polynomial ''m'' are the elementary divisors of the largest degree corresponding to distinct eigenvalues.

The degree of an elementary divisor is the size of the corresponding Jordan block, therefore the dimension of the corresponding invariant subspace. If all elementary divisors are linear, ''A'' is diagonalizable.

=== Invariant subspace decompositions ===

The Jordan form of a ''n'' &amp;times; ''n'' matrix ''A'' is block diagonal, and therefore gives a decomposition of the ''n'' dimensional Euclidean space into [[invariant subspace]]s of ''A''. Every Jordan block ''J''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; corresponds to an invariant subspace ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;. Symbolically, we put

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}^n = \bigoplus_{i = 1}^k X_i&lt;/math&gt;

where each ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is the span of the corresponding Jordan chain, and ''k'' is the number of Jordan chains.

One can also obtain a slightly different decomposition via the Jordan form. Given an eigenvalue λ&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, the size of its largest corresponding Jordan block ''s''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; is called the '''index''' of  λ&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; and denoted by ν(λ&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;). (Therefore, the degree of the minimal polynomial is the sum of all indices.) Define a subspace ''Y''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; by

:&lt;math&gt;\; Y_i = \operatorname{Ker} (\lambda_i I - A)^{\nu(\lambda_i)}.&lt;/math&gt;

This gives the decomposition

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}^n = \bigoplus_{i = 1}^l Y_i&lt;/math&gt;

where ''l'' is the number of distinct eigenvalues of ''A''. Intuitively, we glob together the Jordan block invariant subspaces corresponding to the same eigenvalue. In the extreme case where ''A'' is a multiple of the identity matrix we have ''k'' = ''n'' and ''l'' = 1.

The projection onto ''Y&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' and along all the other ''Y&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'' ( ''j'' ≠ ''i'' ) is called '''the spectral projection of ''A'' at λ&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;''' and is usually denoted by '''''P''(λ&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; ; ''A'')'''. Spectral projections are mutually orthogonal in the sense that ''P''(λ&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; ; ''A'') ''P''(λ&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; ; ''A'') = 0 if ''i'' ≠ ''j''. Also they commute with ''A'' and their sum is the identity matrix. Replacing every λ&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; in the Jordan matrix ''J'' by one and zeroising all other entries gives ''P''(λ&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; ; ''J''), moreover if ''U J U''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; is the similarity transformation such that ''A'' = ''U J U''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; then ''P''(λ&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; ; ''A'') = ''U P''(λ&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; ; ''J'') ''U''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;. They are not confined to finite dimensions. See below for their application to compact operators, and in [[holomorphic functional calculus]] for a more general discussion.

Comparing the two decompositions, notice that, in general, ''l'' ≤ ''k''. When ''A'' is normal, the subspaces ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;'s in the first decomposition are one-dimensional and mutually orthogonal. This is the [[spectral theorem]] for normal operators. The second decomposition generalizes more easily for general compact operators on Banach spaces.

It might be of interest here to note some properties of the index, ν(''λ''). More generally, for a complex number λ, its index can be defined as the least non-negative integer ν(λ) such that

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Ker}(\lambda - A)^{\nu(\lambda)} = \operatorname{Ker} (\lambda - A)^m, \; \forall m \geq \nu(\lambda) .&lt;/math&gt;

So ν(λ) &amp;gt; 0 if and only if λ is an eigenvalue of ''A''. In the finite-dimensional case, ν(λ) ≤ the algebraic multiplicity of λ.

Jordan reduction can be extended to any square matrix ''M'' whose entries lie in a [[field (mathematics)|field]] ''K''.  The result states that any ''M'' can be written as a sum ''D'' + ''N'' where ''D'' is [[semisimple operator|semisimple]], ''N'' is [[nilpotent matrix|nilpotent]], and ''DN'' = ''ND''. This is called the [[Jordan–Chevalley decomposition]]. Whenever ''K'' contains the eigenvalues of ''M'', in particular when ''K'' is [[algebraically closed]], the normal form can be expressed explicitly as the [[direct sum]] of Jordan blocks. 
 
Similar to the case when ''K'' is the complex numbers, knowing the dimensions of the kernels of (''M'' &amp;minus; λ''I'')&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; for 1 ≤ ''k'' ≤ ''m'', where ''m'' is the [[algebraic multiplicity]] of the eigenvalue λ, allows one to determine the Jordan form of ''M''. We may view the underlying vector space ''V'' as a ''K''[''x'']-[[module (mathematics)|module]] by regarding the action of ''x'' on ''V'' as application of ''M'' and extending by ''K''-linearity. Then the polynomials (''x''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;λ)&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; are the elementary divisors of ''M'', and the Jordan normal form is concerned with representing ''M'' in terms of blocks associated to the elementary divisors.

The proof of the Jordan normal form is usually carried out as an application to the [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] ''K''[''x''] of the [[structure theorem for finitely generated modules over a principal ideal domain]], of which it is a corollary.

=== Compact operators ===

In a different direction, for [[compact operator]]s on a [[Banach space]], a result analogous to the Jordan normal form holds. One restricts to compact operators because every point ''x'' in the spectrum of a compact operator ''T'', the only exception being when ''x'' is the limit point of the spectrum, is an eigenvalue. This is not true for bounded operators in general. To give some idea of this generalization, we first reformulate the Jordan decomposition in the language of functional analysis.

==== Holomorphic functional calculus ====
{{ Details|holomorphic functional calculus}}
Let ''X'' be a Banach space, ''L''(''X'') be the bounded operators on ''X'', and σ(''T'') denote the [[spectrum (functional analysis)|spectrum]] of ''T'' ∈ ''L''(''X''). The [[holomorphic functional calculus]] is defined as follows:

Fix a bounded operator ''T''. Consider the family Hol(''T'') of complex functions that is [[Holomorphic function|holomorphic]] on some open set ''G'' containing σ(''T''). Let Γ = {γ&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;} be a finite collection of [[Jordan curve]]s such that σ(''T'') lies in the ''inside'' of Γ, we define ''f''(''T'') by

: &lt;math&gt;f(T) = \frac{1}{2 \pi i} \int_{\Gamma} f(z)(z - T)^{-1} dz.&lt;/math&gt;

The open set ''G'' could vary with ''f'' and need not be connected. The integral is defined as the limit of the Riemann sums, as in the scalar case. Although the integral makes sense for continuous ''f'', we restrict to holomorphic functions to apply the machinery from classical function theory (e.g., the Cauchy integral formula). The assumption that σ(''T'') lie in the inside of Γ ensures ''f''(''T'') is well defined; it does not depend on the choice of Γ. The functional calculus is the mapping Φ from Hol(''T'') to ''L''(''X'') given by

: &lt;math&gt;\; \Phi(f) = f(T).&lt;/math&gt;

We will require the following properties of this functional calculus:
# Φ extends the polynomial functional calculus.
# The ''spectral mapping theorem'' holds: σ(''f''(''T'')) = ''f''(σ(''T'')).
# Φ is an algebra homomorphism.

==== The finite-dimensional case ====

In the finite-dimensional case, σ(''T'') = {λ&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;} is a finite discrete set in the complex plane. Let ''e''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; be the function that is 1 in some open neighborhood of λ&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; and 0 elsewhere. By property 3 of the functional calculus, the operator

:&lt;math&gt;\; e_i(T)&lt;/math&gt;

is a projection. Moreoever, let ν&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; be the index of λ&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; and

:&lt;math&gt;f(z)= (z - \lambda_i)^{\nu_i}.&lt;/math&gt;

The spectral mapping theorem tells us

:&lt;math&gt; f(T) e_i (T) = (T - \lambda_i)^{\nu_i} e_i (T)&lt;/math&gt;

has spectrum {0}. By property 1, ''f''(''T'') can be directly computed in the Jordan form, and by inspection, we see that the operator ''f''(''T'')''e&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''(''T'') is the zero matrix.

By property 3, ''f''(''T'') ''e''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;(''T'') = ''e''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;(''T'') ''f''(''T''). So ''e''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;(''T'') is precisely the projection onto
the subspace

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Ran} \; e_i (T) = \mathrm{Ker}(T - \lambda_i)^{\nu_i}.&lt;/math&gt;

The relation

:&lt;math&gt;\; \sum_i e_i = 1&lt;/math&gt;

implies

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}^n = \bigoplus_i \; \mathrm{Ran}\; e_i (T) = \bigoplus_i \; \mathrm{Ker}(T - \lambda_i)^{\nu_i}&lt;/math&gt;

where the index ''i'' runs through the distinct eigenvalues of ''T''. This is exactly the invariant subspace decomposition

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}^n = \bigoplus_i Y_i&lt;/math&gt;

given in a previous section. Each ''e&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''(''T'') is the projection onto the subspace spanned by the Jordan chains corresponding to λ&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; and along the subspaces spanned by the Jordan chains corresponding to λ&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; for ''j'' ≠ ''i''. In other words, ''e&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''(''T'') = ''P''(λ&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;;''T''). This explicit identification of the operators ''e&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''(''T'') in turn gives an explicit form of holomorphic functional calculus for matrices:

:For all ''f'' ∈ Hol(''T''),

:&lt;math&gt;f(T) = \sum_{\lambda_i \in \sigma(T)} \sum_{k = 0}^{\nu_i -1} \frac{f^{(k)}}{k!} (T - \lambda_i)^k e_i (T).&lt;/math&gt;

Notice that the expression of ''f''(''T'') is a finite sum because, on each neighborhood of λ&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, we have chosen the Taylor series expansion of ''f'' centered at λ&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;.

==== Poles of an operator ====

Let ''T'' be a bounded operator λ be an isolated point of σ(''T''). (As stated above, when ''T'' is compact, every point in its spectrum is an isolated point, except possibly the limit point 0.)

The point λ is called a '''pole''' of operator ''T'' with order ν if the [[Resolvent formalism|resolvent]] function ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''T''&lt;/sub&gt; defined by

:&lt;math&gt;\; R_T(\lambda) = (\lambda - T)^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;

has a [[pole (complex analysis)|pole]] of order ν at λ.

We will show that, in the finite-dimensional case, the order of an eigenvalue coincides with its index. The result also holds for compact operators.

Consider the annular region ''A'' centered at the eigenvalue λ with sufficiently small radius ε such that the intersection of the open disc ''B''&lt;sub&gt;ε&lt;/sub&gt;(λ) and σ(''T'') is {λ}. The resolvent function ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''T''&lt;/sub&gt; is holomorphic on ''A''.
Extending a result from classical function theory, ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''T''&lt;/sub&gt; has a [[Laurent series]] representation on ''A'':

:&lt;math&gt;R_T(z) = \sum _{- \infty} ^{\infty} a_m (\lambda - z)^m&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;a_{-m} = - \frac{1}{2 \pi i} \int_C (\lambda - z) ^{m-1} (z - T)^{-1} d z&lt;/math&gt; and ''C'' is a small circle centered at λ.

By the previous discussion on the functional calculus,

:&lt;math&gt;\; a_{-m} = -(\lambda - T)^{m-1} e_{\lambda} (T)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\; e_{\lambda}&lt;/math&gt; is 1 on &lt;math&gt;\; B_{\epsilon}(\lambda)&lt;/math&gt; and 0 elsewhere.

But we have shown that the smallest positive integer ''m'' such that

:&lt;math&gt;a_{-m} \neq 0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;a_{-l} = 0 \; \; \forall \; l \geq m&lt;/math&gt;

is precisely the index of λ, ν(λ). In other words, the function ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''T''&lt;/sub&gt; has a pole of order ν(λ) at λ.

== Example ==

This example shows how to calculate the Jordan normal form of a given matrix. As the next section explains, it is important to do the computation exactly instead of rounding the results.

Consider the matrix
:&lt;math&gt;A =
\begin{bmatrix}
 5 &amp;  4 &amp;  2 &amp;  1 \\
 0 &amp;  1 &amp; -1 &amp; -1 \\
-1 &amp; -1 &amp;  3 &amp;  0 \\ 
 1 &amp;  1 &amp; -1 &amp;  2
\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
which is mentioned in the beginning of the article.

The [[characteristic polynomial]] of ''A'' is
:&lt;math&gt; \chi(\lambda) = \det(\lambda I - A) = \lambda^4 - 11 \lambda^3 + 42 \lambda^2 - 64 \lambda + 32 = (\lambda-1)(\lambda-2)(\lambda-4)^2. \, &lt;/math&gt;
This shows that the eigenvalues are 1, 2, 4 and 4, according to algebraic multiplicity. The eigenspace corresponding to the eigenvalue 1 can be found by solving the equation ''Av'' = ''λ v''. It is spanned by the column vector ''v'' = (&amp;minus;1, 1, 0, 0)&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;. Similarly, the eigenspace corresponding to the eigenvalue 2 is spanned by ''w'' = (1, &amp;minus;1, 0, 1)&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;. Finally, the eigenspace corresponding to the eigenvalue 4 is also one-dimensional (even though this is a double eigenvalue) and is spanned by ''x'' = (1, 0, &amp;minus;1, 1)&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;. So, the [[geometric multiplicity]] (i.e., the dimension of the eigenspace of the given eigenvalue) of each of the three eigenvalues is one. Therefore, the two eigenvalues equal to 4 correspond to a single Jordan block, and the Jordan normal form of the matrix ''A'' is the [[Matrix addition#Direct sum|direct sum]]
:&lt;math&gt; J = J_1(1) \oplus J_1(2) \oplus J_2(4) = 
\begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 2 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 4 &amp; 1 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 4 \end{bmatrix}. &lt;/math&gt;
There are three chains. Two have length one: {''v''} and {''w''}, corresponding to the eigenvalues 1 and 2, respectively. There is one chain of length two corresponding to the eigenvalue 4. To find this chain, calculate
: &lt;math&gt;\ker{(A-4I)}^2 = \operatorname{span} \, \left\{ \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}, \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \right\}&lt;/math&gt;
 
where ''I'' is the &lt;!-- &lt;math&gt;4\times 4&lt;/math&gt; --&gt;4 x 4 identity matrix. Pick a vector in the above span that is not in the kernel of ''A''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;4''I'', e.g., ''y'' = (1,0,0,0)&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;. Now, (''A''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;4''I'')''y'' = ''x'' and (''A''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;4''I'')''x'' = 0, so {''y'', ''x''} is a chain of length two corresponding to the eigenvalue 4.

The transition matrix ''P'' such that ''P''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;''AP'' = ''J'' is formed by putting these vectors next to each other as follows
:&lt;math&gt; P = \Big[ \,v\, \Big| \,w\, \Big| \,x\, \Big| \,y\, \Big] = 
\begin{bmatrix}
-1 &amp;  1 &amp;  1 &amp;  1 \\
 1 &amp; -1 &amp;  0 &amp;  0 \\ 
 0 &amp;  0 &amp; -1 &amp;  0 \\
 0 &amp;  1 &amp;  1 &amp;  0
\end{bmatrix}. &lt;/math&gt;
A computation shows that the equation ''P''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;''AP'' = ''J'' indeed holds.

:&lt;math&gt;P^{-1}AP=J=\begin{bmatrix}
1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 2 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 4 &amp; 1 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 4 \end{bmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;

If we had interchanged the order of which the chain vectors appeared, that is, changing the order of ''v'', ''w'' and {''x'', ''y''} together, the Jordan blocks would be interchanged. However, the Jordan forms are equivalent Jordan forms.

== Numerical analysis ==

If the matrix ''A'' has multiple eigenvalues, or is close to a matrix with multiple eigenvalues, then its Jordan normal form is very sensitive to perturbations. Consider for instance the matrix
:&lt;math&gt; A = \begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 1 \\ \varepsilon &amp; 1 \end{bmatrix}. &lt;/math&gt;
If ε = 0, then the Jordan normal form is simply
:&lt;math&gt; \begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 1 \\ 0 &amp; 1 \end{bmatrix}. &lt;/math&gt;
However, for ε ≠ 0, the Jordan normal form is
:&lt;math&gt; \begin{bmatrix} 1+\sqrt\varepsilon &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 1-\sqrt\varepsilon \end{bmatrix}. &lt;/math&gt;
This [[condition number|ill conditioning]] makes it very hard to develop a robust numerical algorithm for the Jordan normal form, as the result depends critically on whether two eigenvalues are deemed to be equal. For this reason, the Jordan normal form is usually avoided in [[numerical analysis]]; the stable [[Schur decomposition]]&lt;ref&gt;See Golub &amp; Van Loan (2014), §7.6.5; or Golub &amp; Wilkinson (1976) for details.&lt;/ref&gt; or [[pseudospectrum|pseudospectra]]&lt;ref&gt;See Golub &amp; Van Loan (2014), §7.9&lt;/ref&gt; are better alternatives.

== Matrix functions ==
{{Main|Matrix function}}
The Jordan normal form is the most convenient for computation of the matrix functions (though it may be not the best choice for computer computations). Let ''f(z)'' be an analytical function of a complex argument. Applying the function on a ''n×n'' Jordan block ''J'' with eigenvalue ''λ'' results in an upper triangular matrix:

:&lt;math&gt;
f(J)
=\begin{bmatrix}
 f(\lambda) &amp; f'(\lambda) &amp; \tfrac{f''(\lambda)}{2} &amp; ...   &amp;  \tfrac{f^{(n-1)}(\lambda)}{(n-1)!}\\
 0  &amp; f(\lambda) &amp; f'(\lambda) &amp; ...   &amp; \tfrac{f^{(n-2)}(\lambda)}{(n-2)!} \\
 \vdots  &amp; \vdots  &amp; \ddots &amp; \ddots   &amp; \vdots \\ 
 0  &amp; 0  &amp; 0  &amp; f(\lambda) &amp; f'(\lambda) \\
 0  &amp; 0  &amp; 0  &amp; 0   &amp; f(\lambda)
\end{bmatrix},&lt;/math&gt;

so that the elements of the ''k''-th superdiagonal of the resulting matrix are &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{f^{(k)}(\lambda)}{k!}&lt;/math&gt;. For a matrix of general Jordan normal form
the above expression shall be applied to each Jordan block.

The following example shows the application to the power function ''f(z)=z&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;'':
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix}
 \lambda_1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
 0 &amp; \lambda_1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \lambda_1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 
 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \lambda_2 &amp; 1 \\
 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \lambda_2
\end{bmatrix}^n
=\begin{bmatrix}
 \lambda_1^n &amp; \tbinom{n}{1}\lambda_1^{n-1} &amp; \tbinom{n}{2}\lambda_1^{n-2} &amp; 0   &amp; 0 \\
 0  &amp; \lambda_1^n &amp; \tbinom{n}{1}\lambda_1^{n-1} &amp; 0   &amp; 0 \\
 0  &amp; 0  &amp; \lambda_1^n &amp; 0   &amp; 0 \\ 
 0  &amp; 0  &amp; 0  &amp; \lambda_2^n &amp; \tbinom{n}{1}\lambda_2^{n-1} \\
 0  &amp; 0  &amp; 0  &amp; 0   &amp; \lambda_2^n
\end{bmatrix},&lt;/math&gt;
where the binomial coefficients are defined as &lt;math&gt;\tbinom{n}{k}=\prod_{i=1}^k \tfrac{n+1-i}{i}&lt;/math&gt;. For integer positive ''n'' it reduces to standard definition
of the coefficients. For negative ''n'' the identity &lt;math&gt;\tbinom{-n}{k}=\left(-1\right)^k\tbinom{n+k-1}{k}&lt;/math&gt; may be of use.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1615">In [[set theory]], a '''Laver function''' (or '''Laver diamond''', named after its inventor, [[Richard Laver]]) is a function connected with [[supercompact cardinal]]s.

==Definition==
If κ is a supercompact cardinal, a Laver function is a function ''ƒ'':κ&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;''V''&lt;sub&gt;κ&lt;/sub&gt; such that for every set ''x'' and every cardinal λ&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;|TC(''x'')|&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;κ there is a supercompact measure ''U'' on [λ]&lt;sup&gt;&lt;κ&lt;/sup&gt; such that if ''j''&lt;sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;''U''&lt;/sub&gt; is the associated elementary embedding then ''j''&lt;sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;''U''&lt;/sub&gt;(''ƒ'')(κ) = ''x''. (Here ''V''&lt;sub&gt;κ&lt;/sub&gt; denotes the κ-th level of the [[cumulative hierarchy]], TC(''x'') is the [[transitive set|transitive closure]] of ''x'')

==Applications==
The original application of Laver functions was the following theorem of Laver.   
If κ is supercompact, there is a κ-c.c. [[forcing (mathematics)|forcing]] notion (''P'',&amp;nbsp;≤) such after forcing with (''P'',&amp;nbsp;≤) the following holds: κ is supercompact and remains supercompact after forcing with any κ-directed closed forcing.

There are many other applications, for example the proof of the consistency of the [[proper forcing axiom]].

{{hatnote|This article uses forms of [[Mathematical logic|logical]] notation. For a concise description of the symbols used in this notation, see [[List of logic symbols]].}}

In [[logic]], the '''law of excluded middle''' (or the '''principle of excluded middle''') states that for any [[proposition]], [[Exclusive or|either]] that proposition is [[Truth value|true]] or its [[negation]] is true. It is the third of the [[three classic laws of thought]].

The law is also known as the '''law''' (or '''principle''') '''of the excluded third''', in [[Latin]] '''''principium tertii exclusi'''''. Another Latin designation for this law is '''''tertium non datur''''': "no third [possibility] is given".

The earliest known formulation is in Aristotle's discussion of the [[principle of non-contradiction]], first proposed in ''[[On Interpretation]],''&lt;ref&gt;Geach p. 74&lt;/ref&gt; where he says that of two [[contradictory]] propositions (i.e. where one proposition is the negation of the other) one must be true, and the other false.&lt;ref&gt;''On Interpretation'', c. 9&lt;/ref&gt;  He also states it as a principle in the ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'' book 3, saying that it is necessary in every case to affirm or deny,&lt;ref&gt;''Metaphysics 2, 996b 26–30&lt;/ref&gt; and that it is impossible that there should be anything between the two parts of a contradiction.&lt;ref&gt;''Metaphysics 7, 1011b 26–27&lt;/ref&gt; The principle was stated as a [[theorem]] of [[propositional logic]] by [[Bertrand Russell|Russell]] and [[Alfred North Whitehead|Whitehead]] in  ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'' as:

&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{*2\cdot11}. \ \  \vdash . \ p \ \vee \thicksim p&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=[[Alfred North Whitehead]], [[Bertrand Russell]]|title=Principia Mathematica|publisher=[[Cambridge]]|year=1910|pages=105 |url=http://name.umdl.umich.edu/aat3201.0001.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The principle should not be confused with the semantical [[principle of bivalence]], which states that every proposition is either true or false.

== Classic laws of thought ==
The principle of excluded middle, along with its complement, the [[law of contradiction|law of non-contradiction]] (the second of the [[three classic laws of thought]]), are correlates of the [[law of identity]] (the first of these laws).

== Analogous laws ==
Some systems of logic have different but analogous laws. For some finite ''n''-valued logics, there is an analogous law called the '''law of excluded ''n''+1th'''. If negation is [[cyclic negation|cyclic]] and "∨" is a "max operator", then the law can be expressed in the object language by (P ∨ ~P ∨ ~~P ∨ ... ∨ ~...~P), where "~...~" represents ''n''−1 negation signs and "∨ ... ∨" ''n''−1 disjunction signs. It is easy to check that the sentence must receive at least one of the ''n'' [[truth value]]s (and not a value that is not one of the ''n'').

Other systems reject the law entirely.

== Examples ==
For example, if ''P'' is the proposition:

:''Socrates is mortal.''

then the law of excluded middle holds that the [[logical disjunction]]:

:''Either Socrates is mortal, or it is not the case that Socrates is mortal.''

is true by virtue of its form alone. That is, the "middle" position, that Socrates is neither mortal nor not-mortal, is excluded by logic, and therefore either the first possibility (''Socrates is mortal'') or its negation (''it is not the case that Socrates is mortal'') must be true.

An example of an argument that depends on the law of excluded middle follows.&lt;ref&gt;This well-known example of a non-constructive proof depending on  the law of excluded middle can be found in many places, for example: {{cite web |first=Norman |last=Megill |title=Metamath: A Computer Language for Pure Mathematics'', footnote on p. 17, |url=http://us.metamath.org/index.html#book}} and Davis 2000:220, footnote 2.&lt;/ref&gt; We seek to prove that there exist two [[irrational number]]s &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; such that

:&lt;math&gt;a^b&lt;/math&gt; is rational.

It is known that &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt; is irrational (see [[Square root of 2#Proofs of irrationality|proof]]). Consider the number

:&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}}&lt;/math&gt;.

Clearly (excluded middle) this number is either rational or irrational. If it is rational, the proof is complete, and
:&lt;math&gt;a=\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b=\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt;.

But if &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}}&lt;/math&gt; is irrational, then let

:&lt;math&gt;a=\sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b=\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt;.

Then

:&lt;math&gt;a^b = \left(\sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}}\right)^{\sqrt{2}} = \sqrt{2}^{\left(\sqrt{2}\cdot\sqrt{2}\right)} = \sqrt{2}^2 = 2&lt;/math&gt;,

and 2 is certainly rational. This concludes the proof.

In the above argument, the assertion "this number is either rational or irrational" invokes the law of excluded middle. An [[intuitionist]], for example, would not accept this argument without further support for that statement. This might come in the form of a proof that the number in question is in fact irrational (or rational, as the case may be); or a finite algorithm that could determine whether the number is rational.

=== The law in non-constructive proofs over the infinite ===

The above proof is an example of a ''[[non-constructive]]'' proof disallowed by intuitionists:
{{quote|The proof is non-constructive because it doesn't give specific numbers &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; that satisfy the theorem but only two separate possibilities, one of which must work. (Actually &lt;math&gt;a=\sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}}&lt;/math&gt; is irrational but there is no known easy proof of that fact.) (Davis 2000:220)}} (Constructive proofs of the specific example above are not hard to produce; for example &lt;math&gt;a=\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b=\log_2 9&lt;/math&gt; are both easily shown to be irrational, and &lt;math&gt;a^b=3&lt;/math&gt;; a proof allowed by intuitionists).

By ''non-constructive'' Davis means that "a proof that there actually are mathematic entities satisfying certain conditions would not have to provide a method to exhibit explicitly the entities in question." (p.&amp;nbsp;85). Such proofs presume the existence of a totality that is complete, a notion disallowed by intuitionists when extended to the ''infinite''—for them the infinite can never be completed:

{{quote|In classical mathematics there occur ''non-constructive'' or ''indirect'' existence proofs, which intuitionists do not accept. For example, to prove ''there exists an n such that P''(''n''), the classical mathematician may deduce a contradiction from the assumption for all ''n'', not ''P''(''n''). Under both the classical and the intuitionistic logic, by reductio ad absurdum this gives ''not for all n, not P''(''n''). The classical logic allows this result to be transformed into ''there exists an n such that P''(''n''), but not in general the intuitionistic... the classical meaning, that somewhere in the completed infinite totality of the natural numbers there occurs an ''n'' such that ''P''(''n''), is not available to him, since he does not conceive the natural numbers as a completed totality.&lt;ref&gt;In a comparative analysis (pp. 43–59) of the three "-isms" (and their foremost spokesmen)—Logicism (Russell and Whitehead), Intuitionism (Brouwer) and Formalism (Hilbert)—Kleene turns his thorough eye toward intuitionism, its "founder" Brouwer, and the intuitionists' complaints with respect to the law of excluded middle as applied to arguments over the "completed infinite".&lt;/ref&gt; (Kleene 1952:49–50)}}

Indeed, [[David Hilbert]] and [[Luitzen E. J. Brouwer]] both give examples of the law of excluded middle extended to the infinite. Hilbert's example: "the assertion that either there are only finitely many prime numbers or there are infinitely many" (quoted in Davis 2000:97); and Brouwer's: "Every mathematical species is either finite or infinite." (Brouwer 1923 in van Heijenoort 1967:336).

In general, intuitionists allow the use of the law of excluded middle when it is confined to discourse over finite collections (sets), but not when it is used in discourse over infinite sets (e.g. the natural numbers). Thus intuitionists absolutely disallow the blanket assertion: "For all propositions ''P'' concerning infinite sets ''D'': ''P'' or ~''P''" (Kleene 1952:48).

:''For more about the conflict between the intuitionists (e.g. Brouwer) and the formalists (Hilbert) see [[Foundations of mathematics]] and [[Intuitionism]].''

Putative counterexamples to the law of excluded middle include the [[liar paradox]] or [[Quine's Paradox]]. Certain resolutions of these paradoxes, particularly [[Graham Priest]]'s [[dialetheism]] as formalised in LP, have the law of excluded middle as a theorem, but resolve out the Liar as both true and false. In this way, the law of excluded middle is true, but because truth itself, and therefore disjunction, is not exclusive, it says next to nothing if one of the disjuncts is paradoxical, or both true and false.

== History ==

=== Aristotle ===

[[Aristotle]] wrote that ambiguity can arise from the use of ambiguous names, but cannot exist in the facts themselves:

{{quote|It is impossible, then, that "being a man" should mean precisely "not being a man", if "man" not only signifies something about one subject but also has one significance. ... And it will not be possible to be and not to be the same thing, except in virtue of an ambiguity, just as if one whom we call "man", and others were to call "not-man"; but the point in question is not this, whether the same thing can at the same time be and not be a man in name, but whether it can be in fact. (''Metaphysics'' 4.4, W.D. Ross (trans.), GBWW 8, 525–526).}}

Aristotle's assertion that "...it will not be possible to be and not to be the same thing", which would be written in propositional logic as ¬(''P'' ∧ ¬''P''), is a statement modern logicians could call the law of excluded middle (''P'' ∨ ¬''P''), as distribution of the negation of Aristotle's assertion makes them equivalent, regardless that the former claims that no statement is ''both'' true and false, while the latter requires that any statement is ''either'' true or false.

However, Aristotle also writes, "since it is impossible that contradictories should be at the same time true of the same thing, obviously contraries also cannot belong at the same time to the same thing" (Book IV, CH 6, p.&amp;nbsp;531). He then proposes that "there cannot be an intermediate between contradictories, but of one subject we must either affirm or deny any one predicate" (Book IV, CH 7, p.&amp;nbsp;531). In the context of Aristotle's [[traditional logic]], this is a remarkably precise statement of the law of excluded middle, ''P'' ∨ ¬''P''.

=== Leibniz ===

{{quote|Its usual form, "Every judgment is either true or false" [footnote 9]..."(from Kolmogorov in van Heijenoort, p. 421) footnote 9: "This is [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]]'s very simple formulation (see ''[[New Essays on Human Understanding|Nouveaux Essais]]'', IV,2)...." (ibid p 421)}}

=== Bertrand Russell and ''Principia Mathematica'' ===

[[Bertrand Russell]] asserts a distinction between the "law of excluded middle" and the "law of noncontradiction". In ''[[The Problems of Philosophy]]'', he cites three "Laws of Thought" as more or less "self-evident"  or "a priori" in the sense of Aristotle:

::1. [[Law of identity]]: "Whatever is, is."
::2. [[Law of noncontradiction]]: "Nothing can both be and not be."
::3. '''Law of excluded middle''': "Everything must either be or not be."

::These three laws are samples of self-evident logical principles... (p. 72)

It is correct, at least for bivalent logic—i.e. it can be seen with a [[Karnaugh map]]—that Russell's Law (2) removes "the middle" of the [[Logical disjunction|inclusive-or]] used in his law (3). And this is the point of Reichenbach's demonstration that some believe the [[Exclusive or|''exclusive''-or]] should take the place of the [[Logical disjunction|''inclusive''-or]].

About this issue (in admittedly very technical terms) Reichenbach observes:

::The tertium non datur
::29. (''x'')[''f''(''x'') ∨ ~''f''(''x'')]
::is not exhaustive in its major terms and is therefore an inflated formula. This fact may perhaps explain why some people consider it unreasonable to write (29) with the inclusive-'or', and want to have it written with the sign of the ''exclusive''-'or'

::30. (''x'')[''f''(''x'') ⊕ ~''f''(''x'')],  where the symbol "⊕" signifies [[exclusive-or]]&lt;ref&gt;The original symbol as used by Reichenbach is an upside down V, nowadays used for AND. The AND for Reichenbach is the same as that used in Principia Mathematica -- a "dot" cf p. 27 where he shows a truth table where he defines "a.b". Reichenbach defines the exclusive-or on p. 35 as "the negation of the equivalence". One sign used nowadays is a circle with a + in it, i.e. ⊕ (because in binary, a ⊕ b yields modulo-2 addition -- addition without carry). Other signs are ≢ (not identical to), or ≠ (not equal to).&lt;/ref&gt;
::in which form it would be fully exhaustive and therefore nomological in the narrower sense. (Reichenbach, p. 376)

In line (30) the "(x)" means "for all" or "for every", a form used by Russell and Reichenbach; today the symbolism is usually &lt;math&gt;\forall&lt;/math&gt; ''x''. Thus an example of the expression would look like this:

* (''pig''): (''Flies''(''pig'') ⊕ ~''Flies''(''pig''))
* (For all instances of "pig" seen and unseen): ("Pig does fly" or "Pig does not fly" but not both simultaneously)

==== A formal definition from ''Principia Mathematica'' ====

''[[Principia Mathematica]]'' (''PM'') defines the law of excluded middle formally:

{{quote|*2.1 : ~p ∨ p    (''PM'' p. 101)
Example: Either it is true that "this is red", or it is true that "this is not red". Hence it is true that "this is red or this is not red". (See below for more about how this is derived from the primitive axioms).}}

So just what is "truth" and "falsehood"? At the opening ''PM'' quickly announces some definitions:

{{quote|''Truth-values''. The "truth-values" of a proposition is ''truth'' if it is true and ''falsehood'' if it is false* [*This phrase is due to Frege]...the truth-value of "p ∨ q" is truth if the truth-value of either p or q is truth, and is falsehood otherwise ... that of "~ p" is the opposite of that of p..." (p. 7-8)}}

This is not much help. But later, in a much deeper discussion, ("Definition and systematic ambiguity of Truth and Falsehood" Chapter II part III, p.&amp;nbsp;41 ff ) ''PM'' defines truth and falsehood in terms of a relationship between the "a" and the "b" and the "percipient". For example "This 'a' is 'b'" (e.g. "This 'object a' is 'red'") really means "'object a' is a sense-datum" and "'red' is a sense-datum", and they "stand in relation" to one another and in relation to "I". Thus what we really mean is: "I perceive that 'This object a is red'" and this is an undeniable-by-3rd-party "truth".

''PM'' further defines a distinction between a "sense-datum" and a "sensation":
{{quote|That is, when we judge (say) "this is red", what occurs is a relation of three terms, the mind, and "this", and "red". On the other hand, when we perceive "the redness of this", there is a relation of two terms, namely the mind and the complex object "the redness of this" (pp. 43–44).}}

Russell reiterated his distinction between "sense-datum" and "sensation" in his book ''The Problems of Philosophy'' (1912) published at the same time as ''PM'' (1910–1913):
{{quote|Let us give the name of "sense-data" to the things that are immediately known in sensation: such things as colours, sounds, smells, hardnesses, roughnesses, and so on. We shall give the name "sensation" to the experience of being immediately aware of these things... The colour itself is a sense-datum, not a sensation. (p. 12)}}

Russell further described his reasoning behind his definitions of "truth" and "falsehood" in the same book (Chapter XII ''Truth and Falsehood'').

==== Consequences of the law of excluded middle in ''Principia Mathematica'' ====
From the law of excluded middle, formula ✸2.1 in ''[[Principia Mathematica]],'' Whitehead and Russell derive some of the most powerful tools in the logician's argumentation toolkit. (In ''Principia Mathematica,'' formulas and propositions are identified by a leading asterisk and two numbers, such as "✸2.1".)

✸2.1 ~''p'' ∨ ''p'' "This is the Law of excluded middle" (''PM'', p.&amp;nbsp;101).

The proof of ✸2.1 is roughly as follows: "primitive idea" 1.08 defines ''p'' → ''q'' = ~''p'' ∨ ''q''. Substituting ''p'' for ''q'' in this rule yields ''p'' → ''p'' = ~''p'' ∨ ''p''. Since ''p'' → ''p'' is true (this is Theorem 2.08, which is proved separately), then ~''p'' ∨ ''p'' must be true.

✸2.11 ''p'' ∨ ~''p'' (Permutation of the assertions is allowed by axiom 1.4)&lt;br&gt;
✸2.12 ''p'' → ~(~''p'') (Principle of double negation, part 1: if "this rose is red" is true then it's not true that "'this rose is not-red' is true".)&lt;br&gt;
✸2.13 ''p'' ∨ ~{~(~''p'')} (Lemma together with 2.12 used to derive 2.14)&lt;br&gt;
✸2.14 ~(~''p'') → ''p'' (Principle of double negation, part 2)&lt;br&gt;
✸2.15 (~''p'' → ''q'') → (~''q'' → ''p'') (One of the four "Principles of transposition". Similar to 1.03, 1.16 and 1.17. A very long demonstration was required here.)&lt;br&gt;
✸2.16 (''p'' → ''q'') → (~''q'' → ~''p'') (If it's true that "If this rose is red then this pig flies" then it's true that "If this pig doesn't fly then this rose isn't red.")&lt;br&gt;
✸2.17 ( ~''p'' → ~''q'' ) → (''q'' → ''p'') (Another of the "Principles of transposition".)&lt;br&gt;
✸2.18 (~''p'' → ''p'') → ''p'' (Called "The complement of ''reductio ad absurdum''. It states that a proposition which [[Logical consequence|follows from]] the hypothesis of its own falsehood is true" (''PM'', pp.&amp;nbsp;103–104).)

Most of these theorems&amp;mdash;in particular ✸2.1, ✸2.11, and ✸2.14&amp;mdash;are rejected by intuitionism. These tools are recast into another form that Kolmogorov cites as "Hilbert's four axioms of implication" and "Hilbert's two axioms of negation" (Kolmogorov in van Heijenoort, p.&amp;nbsp;335).

Propositions ✸2.12 and ✸2.14, "double negation":
The [[Intuitionism|intuitionist]] writings of [[L. E. J. Brouwer]] refer to what he calls "the ''principle of the reciprocity of the multiple species'', that is, the principle that for every system the correctness of a property follows from the impossibility of the impossibility of this property" (Brouwer, ibid, p.&amp;nbsp;335).

This principle is commonly called "the principle of double negation" (''PM'', pp.&amp;nbsp;101–102). From the law of excluded middle (✸2.1 and ✸2.11), ''PM'' derives principle ✸2.12 immediately. We substitute ~''p'' for ''p'' in 2.11 to yield ~''p'' ∨ ~(~''p''), and by the definition of implication (i.e. 1.01 p → q = ~p ∨ q) then ~p ∨ ~(~p)= p → ~(~p). QED (The derivation of 2.14 is a bit more involved.)

== The Logicists versus the Intuitionists ==

In late 1800s through the 1930s a bitter, persistent debate raged between Hilbert and his followers versus [[Hermann Weyl]] and [[L. E. J. Brouwer]]. Brouwer's philosophy, called [[Intuitionism]], started in earnest with [[Leopold Kronecker]] in the late 1800s.

Hilbert intensely disliked Kronecker's ideas:

{{quote|...Kronecker insisted that there could be no existence without construction. For him, as for [[Paul Gordan]] [another elderly mathematician], Hilbert's proof of the finiteness of the basis of the invariant system was simply not mathematics. Hilbert, on the other hand, throughout his life was to insist that if one can prove that the attributes assigned to a concept will never lead to a contradiction, the mathematical existence of the concept is thereby established (Reid p. 34)}}

{{quote|It was his [Kronecker's] contention that nothing could be said to have mathematical existence unless it could actually be constructed with a finite number of positive integers (Reid p. 26)}}

The debate had a profound effect on Hilbert. Reid indicates that [[Hilbert's second problem]] (one of [[Hilbert's problems]] from the Second International Conference in Paris in 1900) evolved from this debate (italics in the original):

::In his second problem [Hilbert] had asked for a ''mathematical proof'' of the consistency of the axioms of the arithmetic of real numbers.
::To show the significance of this problem, he added the following observation:
::"If contradictory attributes be assigned to a concept, I say that ''mathematically the concept does not exist''"... (Reid p. 71)

Thus Hilbert was saying: "If ''p'' and ~''p'' are both shown to be true, then ''p'' does not exist" and he was thereby invoking the law of excluded middle cast into the form of the law of contradiction.

{{quote|And finally constructivists ... restricted mathematics to the study of concrete operations on finite or potentially (but not actually) infinite structures; completed infinite totalities ... were rejected, as were indirect proof based on the Law of Excluded Middle. Most radical among the constructivists were the intuitionists, led by the erstwhile topologist L. E. J. Brouwer ... (Dawson p. 49)}}

The rancorous debate continued through the early 1900s into the 1920s; in 1927 Brouwer complained about "polemicizing against it [intuitionism] in sneering tones" (Brouwer in van Heijenoort, p. 492). However, the debate had been fertile: it had resulted in ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'' (1910–1913), and that work gave a precise definition to the law of excluded middle, and all this provided an intellectual setting and the tools necessary for the mathematicians of the early twentieth century:

{{quote|Out of the rancor, and spawned in part by it, there arose several important logical developments...Zermelo's axiomatization of set theory (1908a) ... that was followed two years later by the first volume of ''Principia Mathematica'' ... in which Russell and Whitehead showed how, via the theory of types, much of arithmetic could be developed by logicist means (Dawson p. 49)}}

Brouwer reduced the debate to the use of proofs designed from "negative" or "non-existence" versus "constructive" proof:
::According to Brouwer, a statement that an object exists having a given property means that, and is only proved, when a method is known which in principle at least will enable such an object to be found or constructed...
::Hilbert naturally disagreed.
::"...pure existence proofs have been the most important landmarks in the historical development of our science," he maintained. (Reid p. 155)

::Brouwer ... refused to accept the Logical Principle of the Excluded Middle... His argument was the following:

::"Suppose that A is the statement "There exists a member of the set ''S'' having the property ''P''." If the set is finite, it is possible&amp;mdash;in principle&amp;mdash;to examine each member of ''S'' and determine whether there is a member of ''S'' with the property ''P'' or that every member of ''S'' lacks the property ''P''. For finite sets, therefore, Brouwer accepted the Principle of the Excluded Middle as valid. He refused to accept it for infinite sets because if the set ''S'' is infinite, we cannot&amp;mdash;even in principle&amp;mdash;examine each member of the set. If, during the course of our examination, we find a member of the set with the property ''P'', the first alternative is substantiated; but if we never find such a member, the second alternative is still not substantiated -- perhaps we have just not persisted long enough!
::Since mathematical theorems are often proved by establishing that the negation would involve us in a contradiction, this third possibility which Brouwer suggested would throw into question many of the mathematical statements currently accepted.
::"Taking the Principle of the Excluded Middle from the mathematician," Hilbert said, "is the same as ... prohibiting the boxer the use of his fists."
::"The possible loss did not seem to bother Weyl... Brouwer's program was the coming thing, he insisted to his friends in Zürich." (Reid, p. 149)}}

In his lecture in 1941 at Yale and the subsequent paper [[Gödel]] proposed a solution: "...that the negation of a universal proposition was to be understood as asserting the existence ... of a counterexample" (Dawson, p. 157))

Gödel's approach to the law of excluded middle was to assert that objections against "the use of 'impredicative definitions'" "carried more weight" than "the law of excluded middle and related theorems of the propositional calculus" (Dawson p. 156). He proposed his "system Σ ... and he concluded by mentioning several applications of his interpretation. Among them were a proof of the consistency with [[intuitionistic logic]] of the principle ~ (∀A: (A ∨ ~A)) (despite the inconsistency of the assumption ∃ A: ~ (A ∨ ~A)..." (Dawson, p. 157)

The debate seemed to weaken: mathematicians, logicians and engineers continue to use the law of excluded middle (and double negation) in their daily work.

=== Intuitionist definitions of the Law (Principle) of Excluded Middle ===
The following highlights the deep mathematical and philosophic problem behind what it means to "know", and also helps elucidate what the "law" implies (i.e. what the law really means). Their difficulties with the law emerges: that they do not want to accept as true, implications drawn from that which is unverifiable (untestable, unknowable) or from the impossible or the false. (All quotes are from van Heijenoort, boldface added).

'''Brouwer''' offers his definition of "principle of excluded middle"; we see here also the issue of "testability":

::On the basis of the testability just mentioned, there hold, for properties conceived within a specific finite main system, the "principle of excluded middle", that is, '''the principle that for every system every property is either correct [richtig] or impossible''', and in particular the principle of the reciprocity of the complementary species, that is, the principle that for every system the correctness of a property follows from the impossibility of the impossibility of this property. (335)

'''Kolmogorov''''s definition cites Hilbert's two Axioms of Negation
&lt;ol start="5"&gt;&lt;li&gt;''A'' → (~''A'' → ''B'')&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(''A'' → ''B'') → { (~''A'' → ''B'') → ''B''}&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;

::Hilbert's first axiom of negation, "Anything follows from the false", made its appearance only with the rise of symbolic logic, as did, incidentally, the first axiom of implication.... while... '''the axiom under consideration [axiom 5] asserts something about the consequences of something impossible: we have to accept ''B'' if the true judgment ''A'' is regarded as false'''...
::Hilbert's second axiom of negation expresses the principle of excluded middle. The principle is expressed here in the form in which is it used for derivations: if ''B'' follows from ''A'' as well as from ~''A'', then ''B'' is true. Its usual form, "Every judgment is either true or false" [footnote 9] is equivalent to that given above [footnote 10]"
::Clearly from the first interpretation of negation, that is, the interdiction from regarding the judgment as true, it is impossible to obtain the certitude that the principle of excluded middle is true... Brouwer showed that in the case of such transfinite judgments the principle of excluded middle cannot...be considered obvious
::footnote 9: "This is Leibniz's very simple formulation (see ''Nouveaux Essais'', IV,2). The formulation "''A'' is either ''B'' or not-''B''" has nothing to do with the logic of judgments.
::footnote 10: "Symbolically the second form is expessed thus
:''A'' ∨ ~''A''
where ∨ means "or". The equivalence of the two forms is easily proved... (p. 421)
--&gt;

== Criticisms ==
Many modern logic systems replace the law of excluded middle with the concept of [[negation as failure]]. Instead of a proposition's being either true or false, a proposition is either true or not able to be proved true.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Clark | first = Keith | title = Logic and Data Bases | publisher = [[Springer-Verlag]] | date = 1978 | pages = 293–322 (Negation as a failure) | url = http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~klc/NegAsFailure.pdf | doi = 10.1007/978-1-4684-3384-5_11}}&lt;/ref&gt; These two dichotomies only differ in logical systems that are not [[Completeness (logic)|complete]]. The principle of negation as failure is used as a foundation for [[autoepistemic logic]], and is widely used in [[logic programming]]. In these systems, the programmer is free to assert the law of excluded middle as a true fact, but it is not built-in ''a priori'' into these systems.

Mathematicians such as [[Luitzen Egbertus Jan Brouwer|L.&amp;nbsp;E.&amp;nbsp;J. Brouwer]] and [[Arend Heyting]] have also contested the usefulness of the law of excluded middle in the context of modern mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;
[https://books.google.com/books?id=uUC30fqhdlAC&amp;pg=PA138 "Proof and Knowledge in Mathematics" by Michael Detlefsen]&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Mathematical logic===

In modern [[mathematical logic]], the excluded middle has been shown to result in possible [[self-contradiction]]. It is possible in logic to make well-constructed propositions that can be neither true nor false; a common example of this is the "[[Liar paradox|Liar's paradox]]",&lt;ref&gt;Graham Priest, "[https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/11/28/paradoxical-truth/ Paradoxical Truth]", ''The New York Times,'' November 28, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; the statement "this statement is false", which can itself be neither true nor false. In [[set theory]], such a self-referential paradox can be constructed by examining the set "the set of all sets that do not contain themselves". This set is unambiguously defined, but leads to a [[Russell's paradox]]&lt;ref&gt;Kevin C. Klement, {{cite IEP |url-id=par-russ |title=Russell's Paradox }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Graham Priest, "The Logical Paradoxes and the Law of Excluded Middle", ''The Philosophical Quarterly'', Vol. 33, No. 131, Apr., 1983, pp. 160-165. DOI: 10.2307/2218742. ([https://www.jstor.org/stable/2218742?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents abstract] at JSTOR._&lt;/ref&gt;: does the set contain, as one of its elements, itself? [[Gödel's incompleteness theorem|Gödel's incompleteness theorem]] shows that contradictions of this nature are inherent in mathematical systems.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4932">In [[number theory]], a '''Leyland number''' is a number of the form
:&lt;math&gt;x^y + y^x&lt;/math&gt;
where ''x'' and ''y'' are [[integer]]s greater than 1.&lt;ref name="CP2005"&gt;{{citation |author=[[Richard Crandall]] and [[Carl Pomerance]] |title=Prime Numbers: A Computational Perspective |publisher=Springer |year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are named after the mathematician [[Paul Leyland]]. The first few Leyland numbers are

:[[8 (number)|8]], [[17 (number)|17]], [[32 (number)|32]], [[54 (number)|54]], [[57 (number)|57]], [[100 (number)|100]], [[145 (number)|145]], [[177 (number)|177]], [[320 (number)|320]], [[368 (number)|368]], [[512 (number)|512]], [[593 (number)|593]], [[945 (number)|945]], [[1124 (number)|1124]] {{OEIS|id=A076980}}.

The requirement that ''x'' and ''y'' both be greater than 1 is important, since without it every positive integer would be a Leyland number of the form ''x''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; + 1&lt;sup&gt;''x''&lt;/sup&gt;. Also, because of the [[Commutativity|commutative]] property of addition, the condition ''x'' ≥ ''y'' is usually added to avoid double-covering the set of Leyland numbers (so we have 1 &lt; ''y'' ≤ ''x'').

==Leyland primes==
A '''Leyland prime''' is a Leyland number that is also a prime. The first such primes are:

:17, 593, 32993, 2097593, 8589935681, 59604644783353249, 523347633027360537213687137, 43143988327398957279342419750374600193, ... {{OEIS|id=A094133}}

corresponding to
:3&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+2&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, 9&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+2&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;, 15&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+2&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;, 21&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+2&lt;sup&gt;21&lt;/sup&gt;, 33&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+2&lt;sup&gt;33&lt;/sup&gt;, 24&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;+5&lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt;, 56&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;+3&lt;sup&gt;56&lt;/sup&gt;, 32&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;+15&lt;sup&gt;32&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name="Leyland"&gt;{{cite web |title=Primes and Strong Pseudoprimes of the form x&lt;sup&gt;y&lt;/sup&gt; + y&lt;sup&gt;x&lt;/sup&gt; |url=http://www.leyland.vispa.com/numth/primes/xyyx.htm |publisher=Paul Leyland |accessdate=2007-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One can also fix the value of ''y'' and consider the sequence of ''x'' values that gives Leyland primes, for example ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 2&lt;sup&gt;''x''&lt;/sup&gt; is prime for ''x'' = 3, 9, 15, 21, 33, 2007, 2127, 3759, ... ({{OEIS2C|id=A064539}}).

By November 2012, the largest Leyland number that had been proven to be prime was 5122&lt;sup&gt;6753&lt;/sup&gt; + 6753&lt;sup&gt;5122&lt;/sup&gt; with 25050 digits. From January 2011 to April 2011, it was the largest prime whose primality was proved by [[elliptic curve primality proving]].&lt;ref name="ECPP"&gt;{{cite web |title=Elliptic Curve Primality Proof |url=http://primes.utm.edu/top20/page.php?id=27 |publisher=Chris Caldwell |accessdate=2011-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2012, this was improved by proving the primality of the two numbers 3110&lt;sup&gt;63&lt;/sup&gt; + 63&lt;sup&gt;3110&lt;/sup&gt; (5596 digits) and 8656&lt;sup&gt;2929&lt;/sup&gt; + 2929&lt;sup&gt;8656&lt;/sup&gt; (30008 digits), the latter of which surpassed the previous record.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Mihailescu's CIDE | publisher = mersenneforum.org | date = 2012-12-11 | url = http://mersenneforum.org/showthread.php?t=17554 | accessdate = 2012-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many larger known [[probable prime]]s such as 314738&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; + 9&lt;sup&gt;314738&lt;/sup&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;Henri Lifchitz &amp; Renaud Lifchitz, [http://www.primenumbers.net/prptop/searchform.php?form=x%5Ey%2By%5Ex&amp;action=Search PRP Top Records search].&lt;/ref&gt; but it is hard to prove primality of large Leyland numbers. [[Paul Leyland]] writes on his website: "More recently still, it was realized that numbers of this form are ideal test cases for general purpose primality proving programs. They have a simple algebraic description but no obvious [[cyclotomic]] properties which special purpose algorithms can exploit."

There is a project called XYYXF to [[Integer factorization|factor]] [[Composite number|composite]] Leyland numbers.&lt;ref name="Kulsha"&gt;{{cite web |title=Factorizations of x&lt;sup&gt;y&lt;/sup&gt; + y&lt;sup&gt;x&lt;/sup&gt; for 1 &lt; y &lt; x &lt; 151 |url=http://www.primefan.ru/xyyxf/default.html |publisher=Andrey Kulsha |accessdate=2008-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Leyland number of the second kind==
A '''Leyland number of the second kind''' is a number of the form
:&lt;math&gt;x^y - y^x&lt;/math&gt;
where ''x'' and ''y'' are [[integer]]s greater than 1. 

A '''Leyland prime of the second kind''' is a Leyland number of the second kind that is also prime. The first few such primes are:

:7, 17, 79, 431, 58049, 130783, 162287, 523927, 2486784401, 6102977801, 8375575711, 13055867207, 83695120256591, 375700268413577, 2251799813682647, ... {{OEIS|id=A123206}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8025">In [[mathematics]], an [[operator (mathematics)|operator]] or [[transformation (mathematics)|transform]] is a [[function (mathematics)|function]] from one [[function space|space of functions]] to another. Operators occur commonly in [[engineering]], [[physics]] and mathematics. Many are [[integral operator]]s and [[differential operator]]s.

In the following ''L'' is an operator

Formal economic modeling began in the 19th century with the use of [[differential calculus]] to  represent and explain economic behavior, such as [[utility]] maximization, an early economic application of [[mathematical optimization]]. Economics became more mathematical as a discipline throughout the first half of the 20th century, but introduction of new and generalized techniques in the period around the [[World War II|Second World War]], as in [[game theory]], would greatly broaden the use of mathematical formulations in economics.&lt;ref name="DebreuNeumann"&gt;• [[Gérard Debreu|Debreu, Gérard]] ([1987] 2008).

This rapid systematizing of economics alarmed critics of the discipline as well as some noted economists.  [[John Maynard Keynes]], [[Robert Heilbroner]], [[Friedrich Hayek]] and others have criticized the broad use of mathematical models for human behavior, arguing that some human choices are irreducible to mathematics.

==History==
{{main article|History of economic thought}}
The use of mathematics in the service of social and economic analysis dates back to the 17th century.  Then, mainly in [[Holy Roman Empire|German]] universities, a style of instruction emerged which dealt specifically with detailed presentation of data as it related to public administration.  [[Gottfried Achenwall]] lectured in this fashion, coining the term [[statistics]].  At the same time, a small group of professors in England established a method of "reasoning by figures upon things relating to government" and referred to this practice as ''Political Arithmetick''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schumpeter|first=J.A.|title=History of Economic Analysis|editor=Elizabeth B. Schumpeter|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|year=1954|pages=209–212|isbn=978-0-04-330086-2|oclc=13498913|url=https://books.google.com/?id=xjWiAAAACAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[William Petty|Sir William Petty]] wrote at length on issues that would later concern economists, such as taxation, [[Velocity of money]] and [[Measures of national income and output|national income]], but while his analysis was numerical, he rejected abstract mathematical methodology.  Petty's use of detailed numerical data (along with [[John Graunt]]) would influence statisticians and economists for some time, even though Petty's works were largely ignored by English scholars.&lt;ref&gt;Schumpeter (1954) p. 212-215&lt;/ref&gt;

The mathematization of economics began in earnest in the 19th century.  Most of the economic analysis of the time was what would later be called [[classical economics]].  Subjects were discussed and dispensed with through [[algebra]]ic means, but calculus was not used.  More importantly, until [[Johann Heinrich von Thünen]]'s ''[[The Isolated State]]'' in 1826, economists did not develop explicit and abstract models for behavior in order to apply the tools of mathematics.  Thünen's model of farmland use represents the first example of marginal analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= Schnieder|first=Erich|title=Johann Heinrich von Thünen|journal=[[Econometrica]]|publisher=The Econometric Society|volume=2|issue=1|pages=1–12|issn=0012-9682|oclc=35705710|jstor=1907947|doi= 10.2307/1907947|year= 1934}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thünen's work was largely theoretical, but he also mined empirical data in order to attempt to support his generalizations.  In comparison to his contemporaries, Thünen built economic models and tools, rather than applying previous tools to new problems.&lt;ref&gt;Schumpeter (1954) p. 465-468&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, a new cohort of scholars trained in the mathematical methods of the [[physical science]]s  gravitated to economics, advocating and applying those methods to their subject,&lt;ref&gt;[[Philip Mirowski]], 1991. "The When, the How and the Why of Mathematical Expression in the History of Economics Analysis",  ''Journal of Economic Perspectives'', 5(1) pp. [http://www.fcs.edu.uy/multi/phes/mirowski_math_econ_JEP.pdf 145-157.]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and described today as moving from geometry to [[mechanics]].&lt;ref&gt;[[E.

[http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2008_M000372&amp;edition=current&amp;q=&amp;topicid=&amp;result_number=1 Abstract].&lt;/ref&gt;
These included [[William Stanley Jevons|W.S. Jevons]] who presented paper on a "general mathematical theory of political economy" in 1862, providing an outline for use of the theory of [[marginal utility]] in political economy.&lt;ref&gt;Jevons, W.S. (1866). "Brief Account of a General Mathematical Theory of Political Economy", ''Journal of the Royal Statistical Society'',  XXIX (June) pp.&amp;nbsp;282–87.

Jevons expected that only collection of statistics for price and quantities would permit the subject as presented to become an exact science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jevons|first=W.

&lt;/ref&gt;  At the time, it was thought that utility was quantifiable, in units known as [[util]]s.&lt;ref&gt;While the concept of [[Cardinal utility|cardinality]] has fallen out of favor in [[neoclassical economics]], the differences between cardinal utility and [[ordinal utility]] are minor for most applications.&lt;/ref&gt;  Cournot, Walras and [[Francis Ysidro Edgeworth]] are considered the precursors to modern mathematical economics.&lt;ref name="CWE"&gt;{{cite book|last=Nicola|first=PierCarlo|title=Mainstream Mathermatical Economics in the 20th Century|publisher=Springer|year=2000|page=4|isbn=978-3-540-67084-1|url=https://books.google.com/?id=KR0Rbi8o4QQC|accessdate=2008-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Augustin Cournot====
Cournot, a professor of mathematics, developed a mathematical treatment in 1838 for [[duopoly]]—a market condition defined by competition between two sellers.&lt;ref name="CWE"/&gt;  This treatment of competition, first published in ''[[Researches into the Mathematical Principles of Wealth]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Augustin Cournot (1838, tr. 1897) '' Researches into the Mathematical Principles of Wealth''. Links to [https://books.google.com/books?id=AGoGpyJY_SAC description] and  [https://books.google.com/books?id=AGoGpyJY_SAC&amp;printsec=titlepage#PPR9,M1 chapters.]&lt;/ref&gt; is referred to as [[Cournot competition|Cournot duopoly]]. It is assumed that both sellers had equal access to the market and could produce their goods without cost.  Further, it assumed that both goods were [[Homogeneous good|homogeneous]].  Each seller would vary her output based on the output of the other and the market price would be determined by the total quantity supplied.  The profit for each firm would be determined by multiplying their output and the per unit [[Market price]].  Differentiating the profit function with respect to quantity supplied for each firm left a system of linear equations, the simultaneous solution of which gave the equilibrium quantity, price and profits.&lt;ref name="Stability"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hotelling|first=Harold|authorlink=Harold Hotelling|title=The Collected Economics Articles of Harold Hotelling|editor=Darnell, Adrian C.|publisher=Springer|year=1990|pages=51, 52|chapter=Stability in Competition|isbn=3-540-97011-8|oclc=20217006|url=https://books.google.com/?id=dYbbHQAACAAJ|accessdate=2008-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cournot's contributions to the mathematization of economics would be neglected for decades, but eventually influenced many of the [[Marginalism|marginalists]].&lt;ref name="Stability"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cepa.newschool.edu/het/profiles/cournot.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20000709103727/http://cepa.newschool.edu/het/profiles/cournot.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2000-07-09 |title=Antoine Augustin Cournot, 1801-1877 |work=The History of Economic Thought Website |publisher=The New School for Social Research |accessdate=2008-08-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cournot's models of duopoly and [[Oligopoly]] also represent one of the first formulations of [[non-cooperative game]]s.  Today the solution can be given as a [[Nash equilibrium]] but Cournot's work preceded modern [[game theory]] by over 100 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gibbons|first=Robert|title=Game Theory for Applied Economists|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, New Jersey|year=1992|pages=14, 15|isbn=0-691-00395-5|url=https://books.google.com/?id=_6qgHgAACAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Léon Walras====
While Cournot provided a solution for what would later be called partial equilibrium, Léon Walras attempted to formalize discussion of the economy as a whole through a theory of [[General equilibrium|general competitive equilibrium]].  The behavior of every economic actor would be considered on both the production and consumption side.  Walras originally presented four separate models of exchange, each recursively included in the next.  The solution of the resulting system of equations (both linear and non-linear) is the general equilibrium.&lt;ref&gt;Nicola, p. 9-12&lt;/ref&gt;  At the time, no general solution could be expressed for a system of arbitrarily many equations, but Walras's attempts produced two famous results in economics.  The first is [[Walras' law]] and the second is the principle of [[Walrasian auction|tâtonnement]].  Walras' method was considered highly mathematical for the time and Edgeworth commented at length about this fact in his review of ''Éléments d'économie politique pure'' (Elements of Pure Economics).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Edgeworth |first=Francis Ysidro |authorlink=Francis Ysidro Edgeworth |date=September 5, 1889 |title=The Mathematical Theory of Political Economy: Review of Léon Walras, Éléments d'économie politique pure |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=40 |issue=1036 |pages=434–436 |issn=0028-0836 |doi=10.1038/040434a0 |url=http://cepa.newschool.edu/het/texts/edgeworth/edgewalras89.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030411130712/http://cepa.newschool.edu/het/texts/edgeworth/edgewalras89.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=April 11, 2003 |format=PDF |accessdate=2008-08-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Walras' law was introduced as a theoretical answer to the problem of determining the solutions in general equilibrium.  His notation is different from modern notation but can be constructed using more modern summation notation.  Walras assumed that in equilibrium, all money would be spent on all goods: every good would be sold at the market price for that good and every buyer would expend their last dollar on a basket of goods.  Starting from this assumption, Walras could then show that if there were n markets and n-1 markets cleared (reached equilibrium conditions) that the nth market would clear as well.  This is easiest to visualize with two markets (considered in most texts as a market for goods and a market for money).  If one of two markets has reached an equilibrium state, no additional goods (or conversely, money) can enter or exit the second market, so it must be in a state of equilibrium as well.  Walras used this statement to move toward a proof of existence of solutions to general equilibrium but it is commonly used today to illustrate market clearing in money markets at the undergraduate level.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholson, Walter; Snyder, Christopher, p. 350-353.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tâtonnement (roughly, French for ''groping toward'') was meant to serve as the practical expression of Walrasian general equilibrium.  Walras abstracted the marketplace as an auction of goods where the auctioneer would call out prices and market participants would wait until they could each satisfy their personal reservation prices for the quantity desired (remembering here that this is an auction on ''all'' goods, so everyone has a reservation price for their desired basket of goods).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.economics.unimelb.edu.au/rdixon/wlaw.html|title=Walras Law and Macroeconomics|last=Dixon|first=Robert|work=Walras Law Guide|publisher=Department of Economics, University of Melbourne|accessdate=2008-09-28 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080417102559/http://www.economics.unimelb.edu.au/rdixon/wlaw.html |archivedate = April 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Only when all buyers are satisfied with the given market price would transactions occur.  The market would "clear" at that price—no surplus or shortage would exist.  The word ''tâtonnement'' is used to describe the directions the market takes in ''groping toward'' equilibrium, settling high or low prices on different goods until a price is agreed upon for all goods.  While the process appears dynamic, Walras only presented a static model, as no transactions would occur until all markets were in equilibrium.  In practice very few markets operate in this manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.economics.unimelb.edu.au/rdixon/walproof.html|title=A Formal Proof of Walras Law|last=Dixon|first=Robert|work=Walras Law Guide|publisher=Department of Economics, University of Melbourne|accessdate=2008-09-28 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080430033548/http://www.economics.unimelb.edu.au/rdixon/walproof.html |archivedate = April 30, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Francis Ysidro Edgeworth====
Edgeworth introduced mathematical elements to Economics explicitly in ''[[Mathematical Psychics: An Essay on the Application of Mathematics to the Moral Sciences]]'', published in 1881.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rima|first=Ingrid H.|title=Modern Economic Thought|editor=Weintraub, Sidney|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|year=1977|pages=10, 11|chapter=Neoclassicism and Dissent 1890-1930|isbn=0-8122-7712-0|url=https://books.google.com/?id=s7cJAAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=find&amp;pg=PR5=onepage&amp;q#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He adopted [[Jeremy Bentham]]'s [[felicific calculus]] to economic behavior, allowing the outcome of each decision to be converted into a change in utility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Heilbroner|first=Robert L.|authorlink=Robert Heilbroner|title=The Worldly Philosophers |publisher=Simon and Schuster|location=New York|date=1953 [1999]|edition=Seventh|pages=172–175, 313|isbn=978-0-684-86214-9|url=https://books.google.com/?id=N_3cj4urgJcC}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Using this assumption, Edgeworth built a model of exchange on three assumptions: individuals are self-interested, individuals act to maximize utility, and individuals are "free to recontract with another independently of...any third party."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Edgeworth|first=Francis Ysidro|title=Mathematical Psychics|publisher=Kegan Paul [A. M. Kelley]|location=London|date=1881 [1961]|pages=15–19|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Q4WCGAAACAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Contract-curve-on-edgeworth-box.svg|right|thumb|350px|An [[Edgeworth box]] displaying the contract curve on an economy with two participants.  Referred to as the "core" of the economy in modern parlance, there are infinitely many solutions along the curve for economies with two participants&lt;ref&gt;Nicola, p. 14, 15, 258-261&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Given two individuals, the set of solutions where the both individuals can maximize utility is described by the ''contract curve'' on what is now known as an [[Edgeworth Box]].  Technically, the construction of the two-person solution to Edgeworth's problem was not developed graphically until 1924 by [[Arthur Lyon Bowley]].&lt;ref name="Bowley"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bowley|first=Arthur Lyon|title=The Mathematical Groundwork of Economics: an Introductory Treatise|publisher=Clarendon Press [Kelly]|location=Oxford|date=1924 [1960]|url=https://books.google.com/?id=_cgkAAAAMAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The contract curve of the Edgeworth box (or more generally on any set of solutions to Edgeworth's problem for more actors) is referred to as the [[Core (economics)|core]] of an economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gillies|first=D. B.|title= Contributions to the Theory of Games |editor=Tucker, A. W. |editor2=Luce, R. D.|publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]|location=Princeton, New Jersey|series=[[Annals of Mathematics]]|volume=40|pages=47–85|chapter=Solutions to general non-zero-sum games|isbn=978-0-691-07937-0|url=https://books.google.com/?id=9lSVFzsTGWsC|year=1969}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Edgeworth devoted considerable effort to insisting that mathematical proofs were appropriate for all schools of thought in economics.  While at the helm of ''[[The Economic Journal]]'', he published several articles criticizing the mathematical rigor of rival researchers,  including [[Edwin Robert Anderson Seligman]], a noted skeptic of mathematical economics.&lt;ref name="Moss"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Moss|first=Lawrence S.|year=2003|title=The Seligman-Edgeworth Debate about the  Analysis of Tax Incidence: The Advent of  Mathematical Economics, 1892–1910 |journal=History of Political Economy|publisher=Duke University Press|volume=35|issue=2|pages=207, 212, 219, 234–237|issn=0018-2702|doi=10.1215/00182702-35-2-205}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The articles focused on a back and forth over [[tax incidence]] and responses by producers.  Edgeworth noticed that a monopoly producing a good that had jointness of supply but not jointness of demand (such as first class and economy on an airplane, if the plane flies, both sets of seats fly with it) might actually lower the price seen by the consumer for one of the two commodities if a tax were applied.  Common sense and more traditional, numerical analysis seemed to indicate that this was preposterous.  Seligman insisted that the results Edgeworth achieved were a quirk of his mathematical formulation.  He suggested that the assumption of a continuous demand function and an infinitesimal change in the tax resulted in the paradoxical predictions.  [[Harold Hotelling]] later showed that Edgeworth was correct and that the same result (a "diminution of price as a result of the tax") could occur with a discontinuous demand function and large changes in the tax rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hotelling|first=Harold|authorlink=Harold Hotelling|title=The Collected Economics Articles of Harold Hotelling|editor=Darnell, Adrian C.|publisher=Springer|year=1990|pages=94–122|chapter=Note on Edgeworth's Taxation Phenomenon and Professor Garver's Additional Condition on Demand Functions|isbn=3-540-97011-8|oclc=20217006|url=https://books.google.com/?id=dYbbHQAACAAJ|accessdate=2008-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern mathematical economics==
From the later-1930s, an array of new mathematical tools from the differential calculus and differential equations, [[convex set]]s, and [[graph theory]] were deployed to advance  economic theory in a way similar to new mathematical methods earlier applied to physics.&lt;ref name="DebreuNeumann"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Herstein|first=I.N.|date=October 1953|title=Some Mathematical Methods and Techniques in Economics|journal=Quarterly of Applied Mathematics|publisher=[[American Mathematical Society]]|volume=11|issue=3|pages=249, 252, 260|issn=1552-4485}} [Pp.

===Differential calculus===
{{Main article|Foundations of Economic Analysis|Differential calculus}}
{{See also|Pareto efficiency|Walrasian auction}}

[[Vilfredo Pareto]] analyzed [[microeconomics]] by treating decisions by economic actors as attempts to change a given allotment of goods to another, more preferred allotment.  Sets of allocations could then be treated as [[Pareto efficiency|Pareto efficient]] (Pareto optimal is an equivalent term) when no exchanges could occur between actors that could make at least one individual better off without making any other individual worse off.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nicholson|first1=Walter|author2=Snyder, Christopher|title=Intermediate Microeconomics and Its Applications|publisher=Thompson|year=2007|edition=10th|pages=364, 365|chapter=General Equilibrium and Welfare|isbn=0-324-31968-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Pareto's proof is commonly conflated with Walrassian equilibrium or informally ascribed to [[Adam Smith]]'s [[Invisible hand]] hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1 =Jolink, Albert|chapter=What Went Wrong with Walras?|title=From Walras to Pareto|editor1=Backhaus, Juergen G. |editor2=Maks, J.A.

In the landmark treatise ''[[Foundations of Economic Analysis]]'' (1947), [[Paul Samuelson]] identified a common paradigm and mathematical structure across multiple fields in the subject, building on previous work by [[Alfred Marshall]]. ''Foundations'' took mathematical concepts from  physics and applied them to economic problems. This broad view (for example, comparing [[Le Chatelier's principle]] to [[Walrasian auction|tâtonnement]]) drives the fundamental premise of mathematical economics: systems of economic actors may be modeled and their behavior described much like any other system. This extension followed on the work of the marginalists in the previous century and extended it significantly. Samuelson approached the problems of applying individual utility maximization over aggregate groups with [[comparative statics]], which compares two different [[economic equilibrium|equilibrium]] states after an [[exogenous]] change in a variable. This and other methods in the book provided the foundation for mathematical economics in the 20th century.&lt;ref name="Samuelson"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Metzler|first=Lloyd |authorlink=Lloyd Metzler |year=1948|title=Review of ''Foundations of Economic Analysis''|journal=American Economic Review|volume=38|issue=5|pages=905–910|issn=0002-8282|jstor=1811704|publisher=The American Economic Review, Vol. 38, No. 5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Linear models===

{{See also|Linear algebra|Linear programming|Perron–Frobenius theorem}}

Restricted models of general equilibrium were formulated  by [[John von Neumann]] in 1937.&lt;ref name="Neumann1937"&gt;Neumann, J. von (1937). "Über ein ökonomisches Gleichungssystem und ein Verallgemeinerung des Brouwerschen Fixpunktsatzes", ''Ergebnisse eines Mathematischen Kolloquiums'', 8, pp.&amp;nbsp;73–83,  translated and published in 1945-46, as "A Model of General Equilibrium", ''Review of Economic Studies'', 13, pp. 1–9.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike earlier versions, the models of von Neumann had inequality constraints. For his model of an expanding economy, von Neumann proved the existence and uniqueness of an equilibrium using his generalization of [[Brouwer's fixed point theorem]]. Von Neumann's model of an expanding economy considered the [[generalized eigenvalue problem|matrix pencil]]&amp;nbsp;'' '''A''' - λ '''B''' '' with nonnegative matrices&amp;nbsp;'''A''' and '''B'''; von Neumann sought [[probability vector|probability]] [[generalized eigenvector|vector]]s&amp;nbsp;''p'' and&amp;nbsp;''q'' and a positive number&amp;nbsp;''λ'' that would solve the [[complementarity theory|complementarity]] equation
:'' p&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;('''A''' - λ&amp;nbsp;'''B''')&amp;nbsp;q = 0'',
along with two inequality systems expressing economic efficiency. In this model, the ([[transpose]]d) probability vector ''p'' represents the prices of the goods while the probability vector q represents the "intensity" at which the production process would run.  The unique [[generalized eigenvalue problem|solution]] ''λ'' represents the [[economic growth|rate of growth]] of the economy, which equals the [[interest rate]]. Proving the existence of a positive growth rate and proving that the growth rate equals the interest rate were remarkable achievements, even for von Neumann.&lt;ref&gt;For this problem to have a unique solution, it suffices that the nonnegative matrices&amp;nbsp;'''A''' and&amp;nbsp;'''B''' satisfy an [[Perron–Frobenius theorem|irreducibility condition]], generalizing that of the [[Perron–Frobenius theorem]] of nonnegative matrices, which considers the (simplified) [[eigenvalue|eigenvalue problem]]
:'' '''A''' - λ '''I''' q = 0'',
where the nonnegative matrix''&amp;nbsp;'''A''''' must be square and where the [[diagonal matrix]]''&amp;nbsp;'''I''' ''is the [[identity matrix]]. Von Neumann's irreducibility condition was called the "whales and [[wrangler (profession)|wrangler]]s" hypothesis by David Champernowne, who provided a verbal and economic commentary on the English translation of von Neumann's article. Von Neumann's hypothesis implied that every economic process used a positive amount of every economic good. Weaker "irreducibility" conditions were given by [[David Gale]] and by [[John George Kemeny|John Kemeny]], [[Oskar Morgenstern]], and [[Gerald L. Thompson]] in the 1950s and then by [[Stephen M. Robinson]] in the&amp;nbsp;1970s.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Gale. ''The theory of linear economic models''.

====Input-output economics====
{{Main article|Input-output model}}

In 1936, the Russian–born economist [[Wassily Leontief]] built his model of [[Input-output model|input-output analysis]] from the 'material balance' tables constructed by Soviet economists, which themselves followed earlier work by the [[physiocrat]]s.  With his model, which described a system of production and demand processes, Leontief described how changes in demand in one [[economic sector]] would influence production in another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Screpanti|first1=Ernesto|author2=Zamagni, Stefano|title=An Outline of the History of Economic Thought|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|location=New York|year=1993|pages=288–290|isbn=0-19-828370-9|oclc=57281275}}&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, Leontief  estimated the coefficients of his simple models, to address economically interesting questions. &lt;!-- Leontief's work made him a hero to [[George B.

====Linear optimization====
{{Main article|Linear programming|Simplex algorithm}}

[[Linear programming]] was developed to aid the allocation of resources in firms and in industries during the 1930s in Russia and during the 1940s in the United States. During the [[Berlin airlift|Berlin airlift (1948)]], linear programming was used to plan the shipment of supplies to prevent Berlin from starving after the Soviet  blockade.&lt;ref&gt;M. Padberg, ''Linear Optimization and Extensions'', Second Edition, Springer-Verlag, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dantzig, George B. ([1987] 2008).

====Nonlinear programming====
{{See also|Nonlinear programming|Lagrangian multiplier|Karush–Kuhn–Tucker conditions|Shadow price}}

Extensions to [[nonlinear programming|nonlinear optimization with inequality constraints]] were achieved in 1951 by [[Albert W. Tucker]] and [[Harold Kuhn]], who considered the nonlinear [[optimization problem]]:
:Minimize &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;(&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;) subject to &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''(&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;) ≤ 0 and &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt;''&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;''(&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;) = 0 where
:&lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;(&lt;sup&gt;'''.'''&lt;/sup&gt;) is the [[function (mathematics)|function]] to be minimized
:&lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''(''&lt;sup&gt;'''.'''&lt;/sup&gt;'') (&lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; = 1, ..., &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;) are the functions of the &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; ''inequality [[Constraint (mathematics)|constraints]]''
:&lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt;&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;(&lt;sup&gt;'''.'''&lt;/sup&gt;) (&lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; = 1, ..., &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt;) are the functions of the &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; equality constraints.

In allowing inequality constraints, the [[Karush–Kuhn–Tucker conditions|Kuhn–Tucker approach]] generalized the classic method of [[Lagrange multipliers]], which (until then) had  allowed only equality constraints.&lt;ref&gt;• Intriligator, Michael D. (2008). "nonlinear programming", ''The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics'', 2nd Edition.

====Variational calculus and optimal control====
{{See also|Calculus of variations|Optimal control|Dynamic programming}}

''Economic dynamics'' allows for changes in economic variables over time, including in [[dynamic systems]].  The problem of finding optimal functions for such changes is studied in [[variational calculus]] and in [[optimal control theory]].  Before the Second World War, [[Frank P. Ramsey|Frank Ramsey]] and [[Harold Hotelling]] used the calculus of variations to that end.

====Functional analysis====
{{See also|Functional analysis|Convex set|Supporting hyperplane|Hahn–Banach theorem|Fixed point theorem|Dual space|}}

It was in the course of proving of the existence of an optimal equilibrium in his 1937 model of [[economic growth]] that [[John von Neumann]] introduced [[functional analysis|functional analytic]] methods to include [[topology]] in economic theory, in particular,  [[fixed point theorem|fixed-point theory]] through his generalization of [[Brouwer's fixed-point theorem]].&lt;ref name="DebreuNeumann"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Neumann1937"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Andrew McLennan, 2008.

In Russia, the mathematician [[Leonid Kantorovich]] developed economic models in [[Riesz space|partially ordered vector space]]s, that emphasized the duality between quantities and prices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=L.&amp;nbsp;V|last=Kantorovich|authorlink=Leonid Kantorovich|chapter="My journey in science (supposed report to the Moscow Mathematical Society)" [expanding ''Russian Math.

Even in finite dimensions, the concepts of functional analysis have illuminated economic theory, particularly in clarifying the role of prices as [[normal vector]]s to a [[supporting hyperplane|hyperplane supporting]] a convex set, representing production or consumption possibilities. However, problems of describing optimization over time or under uncertainty require the use of infinite–dimensional function spaces, because agents are choosing among functions or [[stochastic process]]es.&lt;ref name="LK08"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Aliprantis |first1=Charalambos&amp;nbsp;D.|authorlink1=Charalambos D.

===Differential decline and rise===
{{See also|Global analysis|Baire category|Sard's lemma}}

[[John von Neumann]]'s work on [[functional analysis]] and [[topology]] broke new ground in mathematics and economic theory.&lt;ref name="Neumann1937"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NeumannMorgenstern"&gt;Neumann, John von, and Oskar Morgenstern (1944) ''[[Theory of Games and Economic Behavior]]'', Princeton.&lt;/ref&gt; It also left advanced mathematical economics with fewer applications of differential calculus. In particular, general equilibrium theorists used [[general topology]], [[convex geometry]], and [[mathematical optimization|optimization theory]] more than differential calculus, because the approach of differential calculus had failed to establish the existence of an equilibrium.

However, the decline of differential calculus should not be exaggerated, because differential calculus has always been used in graduate training and in applications. Moreover, differential calculus has returned to the highest levels of mathematical economics, [[general equilibrium theory]] (GET), as practiced by the "[[jet set|GET-set]]" (the humorous designation due to [[Jacques H. Drèze]]). In the 1960s and 1970s, however, [[Gérard Debreu]] and [[Stephen Smale]] led a revival of the use of differential calculus in mathematical economics. In particular, they were able to prove the existence of a general equilibrium, where earlier writers had failed, because of their novel mathematics: [[Baire category]] from [[general topology]] and [[Sard's lemma]] from [[differential topology]]. Other economists associated with the use of differential analysis include Egbert Dierker, [[Andreu Mas-Colell]], and [[Yves Balasko]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mas-Colell|first=Andreu|authorlink=Andreu Mas-Colell|year=1985|title=The Theory of general economic equilibrium: A ''differentiable'' approach|series=Econometric Society monographs|publisher=Cambridge&amp;nbsp;UP|isbn=0-521-26514-2|mr=1113262|issue=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Yves Balasko]]. ''Foundations of the Theory of General Equilibrium'', 1988, {{isbn|0-12-076975-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; These advances have changed the traditional narrative of the history of mathematical economics, following von Neumann, which celebrated the abandonment of differential calculus.

John von Neumann, working with [[Oskar Morgenstern]] on the [[Theory of Games and Economic Behavior|theory of games]], broke new mathematical ground in 1944 by extending [[functional analysis|functional analytic]] methods related to [[convex set]]s and [[topology|topological]] [[fixed point theorem (economics)|fixed-point theory]] to economic analysis.&lt;ref name="DebreuNeumann"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NeumannMorgenstern"/&gt; Their work thereby avoided the traditional [[differential calculus]], for which the [[maximum]]–operator did not apply to non-differentiable functions. Continuing von Neumann's work in [[cooperative game|cooperative game theory]], game theorists [[Lloyd S. Shapley]], [[Martin Shubik]], [[Hervé Moulin]], [[Nimrod Megiddo]], [[Bezalel Peleg]] influenced economic research in politics and economics. For example, research on the [[Shapley value|fair prices]] in cooperative games and [[Shapley value#Shapley-Shubik index|fair values]] for [[voting theory|voting game]]s led to changed rules for voting in legislatures and for accounting for the costs in public–works projects. For example, cooperative game theory was used in designing the water distribution system of Southern Sweden and for setting rates for dedicated telephone lines in the USA.

Earlier [[neoclassical economics|neoclassical]] theory had bounded only the ''range'' of bargaining outcomes and in special cases, for  example [[bilateral monopoly]] or along the [[contract curve]] of the [[Edgeworth box]].&lt;ref&gt;Creedy, John (2008).

Following von Neumann's program, however, [[John Forbes Nash, Jr.|John Nash]] used fixed–point theory to prove conditions under which the [[Bargaining#Game theory|bargaining problem]] and [[noncooperative game]]s can generate a unique [[Nash equilibria|equilibrium]] solution.&lt;ref&gt;• Nash, John F., Jr. (1950).

===Agent-based computational economics===
{{main article|Agent-based computational economics}}
Agent-based computational economics (ACE) as a named field is relatively recent, dating from about the 1990s as to published work. It studies economic processes, including whole [[economy|economies]], as [[dynamic systems]] of interacting [[Agent (economics)|agents]] over time. As such, it falls in the [[paradigm]] of [[complex adaptive system]]s.&lt;ref&gt;• Kirman, Alan (2008).  "economy as a complex system", ''The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics '', 2nd Edition.

"whose micro-level interactions create emergent patterns"   in space and time.&lt;ref&gt;Scott E. Page (2008), "agent-based models", ''The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics'', 2nd Edition.

==Econometrics==
{{main article|Econometrics}}
Between the world wars, advances in [[mathematical statistics]] and a cadre of mathematically trained economists &lt;!-- and  [[probability theory]] --&gt; led to [[econometrics]], which was the name proposed for the discipline of advancing economics by using mathematics and statistics. Within economics, "econometrics" has often been used for statistical methods in economics, rather than mathematical economics. Statistical econometrics features the application of linear regression and time series analysis to economic data.

[[Ragnar Anton Kittil Frisch|Ragnar Frisch]] coined the word "econometrics" and helped to found both the [[Econometric Society]] in 1930 and the journal ''[[Econometrica]]'' in 1933.&lt;ref name="Arrow bio of Frisch"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Arrow|first=Kenneth J.|authorlink=Kenneth Arrow|date=April 1960|title=The Work of Ragnar Frisch, Econometrician|journal=[[Econometrica]]|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|volume=28|issue=2|pages=175–192|jstor=1907716|issn=0012-9682|doi=10.2307/1907716}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bjerkholt|first=Olav|date=July 1995|title=Ragnar Frisch, Editor of Econometrica 1933-1954|journal=[[Econometrica]]|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|volume=63|issue=4|pages=755–765|issn=0012-9682|jstor=1906940|doi=10.2307/2171799}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A student of Frisch's, [[Trygve Haavelmo]] published ''The Probability Approach in Econometrics'' in 1944, where he asserted that precise statistical analysis could be used as a tool to validate mathematical theories about economic actors with data from complex sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lange|first=Oskar|year=1945|title=The Scope and Method of Economics|journal=Review of Economic Studies|publisher=The Review of Economic Studies Ltd.|volume=13|issue=1|pages=19–32|issn=0034-6527|jstor=2296113|doi=10.2307/2296113}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This linking of statistical analysis of systems to economic theory was also promulgated by the Cowles Commission (now the [[Cowles Foundation]]) throughout the 1930s and 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Aldrich|first=John|date=January 1989|title=Autonomy|journal=Oxford Economic Papers|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|volume=41|issue=1, History and Methodology of Econometrics |pages=15–34|issn=0030-7653 |jstor=2663180}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The roots of modern econometrics can be traced to the American economist [[Henry Ludwell Moore|Henry L. Moore]].  Moore studied agricultural productivity and attempted to fit changing values of productivity for plots of corn and other crops to a curve using different values of elasticity.  Moore made several errors in his work, some from his choice of models and some from limitations in his use of mathematics.  The accuracy of Moore's models also was limited by the poor data for national accounts in the United States at the time.  While his first models of production were static, in 1925 he published a dynamic "moving equilibrium" model designed to explain business cycles—this periodic variation from overcorrection in supply and demand curves is now known as the [[cobweb model]].  A more formal derivation of this model was made later by [[Nicholas Kaldor]], who is largely credited for its exposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Epstein|first=Roy J.|title=A History of Econometrics|publisher=North-Holland|series=Contributions to Economic Analysis|pages=13–19|isbn=978-0-444-70267-8|oclc=230844893|year=1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Application==
[[Image:Islm.svg|thumb|300 px|The [[IS/LM model]] is a [[Keynesian economics|Keynesian]] [[macroeconomics|macroeconomic]] model designed to make predictions about the intersection of "real" economic activity (e.g. spending, [[Measures of national income and output|income]], savings rates) and decisions made in the financial markets ([[Money supply]] and [[Liquidity preference]]).  The model is no longer widely taught at the graduate level but is common in undergraduate macroeconomics courses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Colander|first=David C.|authorlink=David Colander|year=2004|title=The Strange Persistence of the IS-LM Model|journal=History of Political Economy|publisher=Duke University Press|volume=36|issue=Annual Supplement|doi=10.1215/00182702-36-Suppl_1-305|pages=305–322|issn=0018-2702 }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Much of classical economics can be presented in simple geometric terms or elementary mathematical notation. Mathematical economics, however, conventionally makes use of [[calculus]] and [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix algebra]] in economic analysis in order to make powerful claims that would be more difficult without such mathematical tools. These tools are prerequisites for formal study, not only in mathematical economics but in contemporary economic theory in general. Economic problems often involve so many variables that [[mathematics]] is the only practical way of attacking and solving them.  [[Alfred Marshall]] argued that every economic problem which can be quantified, analytically expressed and solved, should be treated by means of mathematical work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brems|first=Hans|date=October 1975|title=Marshall on Mathematics|journal=Journal of Law and Economics|publisher=University of Chicago Press|volume=18|issue=2|pages=583–585|issn=0022-2186|jstor=725308|doi=10.1086/466825}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Economics has become increasingly dependent upon mathematical methods and the mathematical tools it employs have become more sophisticated.  As a result, mathematics has become considerably more important to professionals in economics and finance. Graduate programs in both economics and finance require strong undergraduate preparation in mathematics for admission and, for this reason, attract an increasingly high number of [[mathematician]]s. [[applied mathematics|Applied mathematicians]] apply mathematical principles to practical problems, such as economic analysis and other economics-related issues, and many economic problems are often defined as integrated into the scope of applied mathematics.&lt;ref name="Dow"/&gt;

This integration results from the formulation of economic problems as stylized models with clear assumptions and falsifiable predictions.  This modeling may be informal or prosaic, as it was in [[Adam Smith]]'s ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'', or it may be formal, rigorous and mathematical.

Broadly speaking, formal economic models may be classified as [[stochastic process|stochastic]] or deterministic and as discrete or continuous.  At a practical level, quantitative modeling is applied to many areas of economics and several methodologies have evolved more or less independently of each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Frigg|first1=R.|author2=Hartman, S.|title=Models in Science|editor=Edward N. Zalta |publisher=The Metaphysics Research Lab|location=Stanford, California|date=February 27, 2006|issn=1095-5054|series=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/models-science/#OntWhaMod|accessdate=2008-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Stochastic|Stochastic models]] are formulated using [[stochastic process]]es. They model economically observable values over time. Most of [[econometrics]] is based on [[statistics]] to formulate and test [[hypotheses]] about these processes or estimate parameters for them. Between the World Wars, [[Herman Wold]] developed a [[Wold decomposition|representation]] of stationary stochastic processes in terms of [[autoregressive]] models and a determinist trend. Wold and [[Jan Tinbergen]] applied time-series analysis to economic data. Contemporary research on [[time series]] [[statistics]] consider additional formulations of stationary processes, such as  [[autoregressive moving average model]]s. More general models include  [[autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity]] (ARCH) models and generalized ARCH ([[GARCH]]) models.
* [[Deterministic system (mathematics)|Non-stochastic mathematical models]] may be purely qualitative (for example, models involved in some aspect of [[social choice theory]]) or quantitative (involving rationalization of financial variables, for example with [[hyperbolic coordinates]], and/or specific forms of [[Function (mathematics)|functional relationships]] between variables).  In some cases economic predictions of a model merely assert the direction of movement of economic variables, and so the functional relationships are used only in a qualitative sense: for example, if the [[price]] of an item increases, then the [[demand]] for that item will decrease.  For such models, economists often use two-dimensional graphs instead of functions.
* [[Qualitative economics|Qualitative models]] are occasionally used. One example is qualitative [[scenario planning]] in which possible future events are played out. Another example is non-numerical decision tree analysis. Qualitative models often suffer from lack of precision.

==Classification==

According to the [[Mathematics Subject Classification]] (MSC), mathematical economics falls into the [[Mathematics Subject Classification#Applied mathematics / other|Applied mathematics/other]] classification of category 91:
:Game theory, economics, social and behavioral sciences

Another source with a similar distinction is ''[[The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics]]'' (1987, 4 vols., 1,300 subject entries).  In it, a "Subject Index" includes mathematical entries under 2 headings (vol. IV, pp.&amp;nbsp;982–3):
:Mathematical Economics (24 listed, such as "acyclicity", "[[aggregation problem]]", "[[comparative statics]]", "[[lexicographic ordering]]s", "[[linear models]]", "[[wikt:ordering|orderings]]", and "[[qualitative economics]]")
:Mathematical Methods (42 listed, such as "[[calculus of variations]]", "[[catastrophe theory]]", "[[combinatorics]]," "[[Computable general equilibrium|computation of general equilibrium]]", "[[convexity in economics|convexity]]", "[[convex programming]]", and "stochastic [[optimal control]]").

A widely used system in [[economics]] that includes mathematical methods on the subject is the [[JEL classification codes]].  It originated in the ''[[Journal of Economic Literature]]'' for classifying new books and articles. The relevant categories are listed below (simplified below to omit "Miscellaneous" and "Other" JEL codes), as reproduced from [[JEL classification codes#Mathematical and quantitative methods JEL: C Subcategories]]. ''[[The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics]]'' (2008, 2nd ed.) also uses the JEL codes to classify its entries.  The corresponding footnotes below have links to [[Abstract (summary)|abstracts]] of ''The New Palgrave [http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/dictionary Online]'' for each JEL category (10 or fewer per page, similar to [[Google]] searches).

==Criticisms and defences==

===Adequacy of mathematics for qualitative and complicated economics===
Friedrich Hayek contended that the use of formal techniques projects a scientific exactness that does not appropriately account for informational limitations faced by real economic agents. &lt;!-- CITATION NEEDED for this: Hayek's concern did not extend to a general critique of mathematical tools in economics. --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

{{quote|I guess the scientific approach began to penetrate and soon dominate the profession in the past twenty to thirty years. This came about in part because of the "invention" of mathematical analysis of various kinds and, indeed, considerable improvements in it. This is the age in which we have not only more data but more sophisticated use of data. So there is a strong feeling that this is a data-laden science and a data-laden undertaking, which, by virtue of the sheer numerics, the sheer equations, and the sheer look of a journal page, bears a certain resemblance to science . . . That one central activity looks scientific. I understand that. I think that is genuine. It approaches being a universal law. But resembling a science is different from being a science.}}
Heilbroner stated that "some/much of economics is not naturally quantitative and therefore does not lend itself to mathematical exposition."&lt;ref&gt;Beed &amp; Owen, 584&lt;/ref&gt;

===Testing predictions of mathematical economics===
Philosopher [[Karl Popper]] discussed the scientific standing of economics in the 1940s and 1950s. He argued that mathematical economics suffered from being tautological. In other words, insofar as economics became a mathematical theory, mathematical economics ceased to rely on empirical refutation  but rather relied on [[mathematical proof]]s and disproof.&lt;ref name="Boland"&gt;{{cite book|last=Boland|first=L.

Sharing Popper's concerns about assumptions in economics generally, and not just mathematical economics, [[Milton Friedman]] declared that "all assumptions are unrealistic".

{{quote|It is a great fault of symbolic pseudo-mathematical methods of formalising a system of economic analysis ... that they expressly assume strict independence between the factors involved and lose their cogency and authority if this hypothesis is disallowed; whereas, in ordinary discourse, where we are not blindly manipulating and know all the time what we are doing and what the words mean, we can keep ‘at the back of our heads’ the necessary reserves and qualifications and the adjustments which we shall have to make later on, in a way in which we cannot keep complicated partial differentials ‘at the back’ of several pages of algebra which assume they all vanish. Too large a proportion of recent ‘mathematical’ economics are merely concoctions, as imprecise as the initial assumptions they rest on, which allow the author to lose sight of the complexities and interdependencies of the real world in a maze of pretentious and unhelpful symbols.}}

===Defense of mathematical economics===
In response to these criticisms, Paul Samuelson argued that mathematics is a language, repeating a thesis of [[Josiah Willard Gibbs]]. In economics, the language of mathematics is sometimes necessary for representing substantive problems. Moreover, mathematical economics has led to conceptual advances in economics.&lt;ref&gt;Paul A. Samuelson (1952). "Economic Theory and Mathematics&amp;nbsp;— An Appraisal", ''American Economic Review'', 42(2), pp. [https://web.archive.org/web/20000914192525/http://cowles.econ.yale.edu/P/cp/p00b/p0061.pdf 56, 64-65] (press '''+''').&lt;/ref&gt;  In particular, Samuelson gave the example of [[microeconomics]], writing that "few people are ingenious enough to grasp [its] more complex parts... ''without'' resorting to the language of mathematics, while most ordinary individuals can do so fairly easily ''with'' the aid of mathematics."&lt;ref&gt;D.W. Bushaw and [[Robert W. Clower|R.W. Clower]] (1957). ''Introduction to Mathematical Economics'', p. [http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.b3513586;page=root;view=image;size=100;seq=11;num=vii vii.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some economists state that mathematical economics deserves support just like other forms of mathematics, particularly its neighbors in [[mathematical optimization]] and [[mathematical statistics]] and increasingly in [[theoretical computer science]]. Mathematical economics and other mathematical sciences have a history in which theoretical advances have regularly contributed to the reform of the more applied branches of economics. In particular, following the program of [[John von Neumann]], game theory now provides the foundations for describing much of applied economics, from  statistical decision theory (as "games against nature") and econometrics to general equilibrium theory and industrial organization. In the last decade, with the rise of the internet, mathematical economists and optimization experts and computer scientists have worked on problems of pricing for on-line services --- their contributions using mathematics from cooperative game theory, nondifferentiable optimization, and combinatorial games.

[[Robert M. Solow]] concluded that mathematical economics was the core "[[infrastructure]]" of contemporary economics:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Economics is no longer a fit conversation piece for ladies and gentlemen. It has become a technical subject. Like any technical subject it attracts some people who are more interested in the technique than the subject. That is too bad, but it may be inevitable. In any case, do not kid yourself: the technical core of economics is indispensable infrastructure for the political economy. That is why, if you consult [a reference in contemporary economics]  looking for enlightenment about the world today, you will be led to technical economics, or history, or nothing at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=The Wide, Wide World Of Wealth (''The New Palgrave:  A Dictionary of Economics''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3459">{{distinguish|Polynomial matrix}}

In mathematics, a '''matrix polynomial''' is a polynomial with [[square matrix|square matrices]] as variables. Given an ordinary, scalar-valued polynomial
: &lt;math&gt;P(x) = \sum_{i=0}^n{ a_i x^i} =a_0  + a_1 x+ a_2 x^2 + \cdots + a_n x^n, &lt;/math&gt;
this polynomial evaluated at a matrix ''A'' is
:&lt;math&gt;P(A) = \sum_{i=0}^n{ a_i A^i} =a_0 I + a_1 A + a_2 A^2 + \cdots + a_n A^n,&lt;/math&gt;
where ''I'' is the [[identity matrix]].{{sfn|Horn|Johnson|1990|p=36}}

A '''matrix polynomial equation''' is an equality between two matrix polynomials, which holds for the specific matrices in question.  A '''matrix polynomial identity''' is a matrix polynomial equation which holds for all matrices ''A'' in a specified [[matrix ring]] ''M&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''(''R'').

== Characteristic and minimal polynomial ==

The [[characteristic polynomial]] of a matrix ''A'' is a scalar-valued polynomial, defined by &lt;math&gt;p_A(t) = \det \left(tI - A\right)&lt;/math&gt;. The [[Cayley–Hamilton theorem]] states that if this polynomial is viewed as a matrix polynomial and evaluated at the matrix ''A'' itself, the result is the zero matrix: &lt;math&gt;p_A(A) = 0&lt;/math&gt;. The characteristic polynomial is thus a polynomial which annihilates ''A''. 

There is a unique [[monic polynomial]] of minimal degree which annihilates ''A''; this polynomial is the [[minimal polynomial (linear algebra)|minimal polynomial]]. Any polynomial which annihilates ''A'' (such as the characteristic polynomial) is a multiple of the minimal polynomial.{{sfn|Horn|Johnson|1990|loc=Thm 3.3.1}}

It follows that given two polynomials ''P'' and ''Q'', we have &lt;math&gt; P(A) = Q(A) &lt;/math&gt; if and only if 
:&lt;math&gt; P^{(j)}(\lambda_i) = Q^{(j)}(\lambda_i) \qquad \text{for } j = 0,\ldots,n_i-1 \text{ and } i = 1,\ldots,s, &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt; P^{(j)} &lt;/math&gt; denotes the ''j''th derivative of ''P'' and &lt;math&gt; \lambda_1, \dots, \lambda_s &lt;/math&gt; are the [[eigenvalue]]s of ''A'' with corresponding indices &lt;math&gt; n_1, \dots, n_s &lt;/math&gt; (the index of an eigenvalue is the size of its largest [[Jordan normal form|Jordan block]]).{{sfn|Higham|2000|loc=Thm 1.3}}

==Matrix geometrical series==

Matrix polynomials can be used to sum a matrix geometrical series as one would an ordinary [[geometric series]],

:&lt;math&gt;S=I+A+A^2+\cdots +A^n&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;AS=A+A^2+A^3+\cdots +A^{n+1}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;(I-A)S=S-AS=I-A^{n+1}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;S=(I-A)^{-1}(I-A^{n+1})&lt;/math&gt;

If ''I''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''A'' is nonsingular one can evaluate the expression for the sum&amp;nbsp;''S''.

In [[mathematics]], a '''multiplication table''' (sometimes, less formally, a '''times table''') is a [[mathematical table]] used to define a [[multiplication]] [[binary operation|operation]] for an algebraic system.

The [[decimal]] multiplication table was traditionally taught as an essential part of elementary arithmetic around the world, as it lays the foundation for arithmetic operations with base-ten numbers. Many educators believe it is necessary to memorize the table up to 9 × 9.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|journal=For the Learning of Mathematics|volume=1|issue=1|year=1980|title=The Multiplication Table: To Be Memorized or Mastered!|first=John|last=Trivett|pages=21–25|jstor= 40247697}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The multiplication table is sometimes attributed to the ancient Greek mathematician [[Pythagoras]] (570–495&amp;nbsp;BC). It is also called the Table of Pythagoras in many languages (for example French, Italian and at one point even Russian), sometimes in English.&lt;ref&gt;for example in [https://books.google.com/books?id=TBBKAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA17&amp;lpg=PA17&amp;dq=%22table+of+pythagoras%22+-Montessori&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=TaXIEXCAic&amp;sig=KiblQIMaPnnwRp-R0eW6CSEQUUk&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=IltFTezaDJH2sgatovGnDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22table%20of%20pythagoras%22%20-Montessori&amp;f=false ''An Elementary Treatise on Arithmetic'' by [[John Farrar (scientist)|John Farrar]]]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Greco-Roman]] mathematician [[Nichomachus]] (60–120&amp;nbsp;AD), a follower of [[Neopythagoreanism]], included a multiplication table in his ''[[Introduction to Arithmetic]]'', whereas the oldest surviving [[Greek mathematics|Greek]] multiplication table is on a wax tablet dated to the 1st century AD and currently housed in the [[British Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;David E. Smith (1958), ''History of Mathematics, Volume I: General Survey of the History of Elementary Mathematics''. New York: Dover Publications (a reprint of the 1951 publication), {{isbn|0-486-20429-4}}, pp. 58, 129.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 493&amp;nbsp;AD, [[Victorius of Aquitaine]] wrote a 98-column multiplication table which gave (in [[Roman numerals]]) the product of every number from 2 to 50 times and the rows were "a list of numbers starting with one thousand, descending by hundreds to one hundred, then descending by tens to ten, then by ones to one, and then the fractions down to 1/144."&lt;ref&gt;David W. Maher and John F. Makowski. "Literary evidence for Roman arithmetic with fractions". ''Classical Philology'', 96/4 (October 2001), p. 383.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1820 book ''The Philosophy of Arithmetic'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Leslie |first=John |year=1820 |title=The Philosophy of Arithmetic; Exhibiting a Progressive View of the Theory and Practice of Calculation, with Tables for the Multiplication of Numbers as Far as One Thousand |publisher=Abernethy &amp; Walker |location=Edinburgh}}&lt;/ref&gt; mathematician [[John Leslie (physicist)|John Leslie]] published a multiplication table up to 99 × 99, which allows numbers to be multiplied in pairs of digits at a time.  Leslie also recommended that young pupils memorize the multiplication table up to 25 × 25. The illustration below shows a table up to 12 × 12, which is a size commonly used in schools.

The traditional rote learning of multiplication was based on memorization of columns in the table, in a form like
{{div col|colwidth=30em}}
&lt;poem&gt;
   1 × 10 = 10
   2 × 10 = 20
   3 × 10 = 30
   4 × 10 = 40
   5 × 10 = 50
   6 × 10 = 60
   7 × 10 = 70
   8 × 10 = 80
   9 × 10 = 90
&lt;/poem&gt;
{{div col end}}

This form of writing the multiplication table in columns with complete number sentences is still used in some countries, such as Bosnia and Herzegovina,{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} instead of the modern grid above.

==Patterns in the tables==
There is a pattern in the multiplication table that can help people to memorize the table more easily. It uses the figures below:

Figure 1 is used for multiples of 1, 3, 7, and 9. Figure 2 is used for the multiples of 2, 4, 6, and 8. These patterns can be used to memorize the multiples of any number from 0 to 10, except 5. As you would start on the number you are multiplying, when you multiply by 0, you stay on 0 (0 is external and so the arrows have no effect on 0, otherwise 0 is used as a link to create a perpetual cycle). The pattern also works with multiples of 10, by starting at 1 and simply adding 0, giving you 10, then just apply every number in the pattern to the "tens" unit as you would normally do as usual to the "ones" unit.

[[File:Multiplication_mnemonic_7.svg|thumb|120px|Using the mnemonic to recall multiples of 7]]
For example, to recall all the multiples of 7:

# Look at the 7 in the first picture and follow the arrow.
# The next number in the direction of the arrow is 4. So think of the next number after 7 that ends with 4, which is 14.
# The next number in the direction of the arrow is 1. So think of the next number after 14 that ends with 1, which is 21.
# After coming to the top of this column, start with the bottom of the next column, and travel in the same direction. The number is 8. So think of the next number after 21 that ends with 8, which is 28.
# Proceed in the same way until the last number, 3, corresponding to 63.
# Next, use the 0 at the bottom. It corresponds to 70.
# Then, start again with the 7.  This time it will correspond to 77.
# Continue like this.

==In abstract algebra==
Tables can also define binary operations on [[group (mathematics)|group]]s, [[field (mathematics)|field]]s, [[ring (mathematics)|ring]]s, and other [[Abstract algebra|algebraic systems]]. In such contexts they can be called [[Cayley table]]s. Here are the addition and multiplication tables for the [[finite field]] '''Z&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;'''.

For every natural number ''n'', there are also addition and multiplication tables for the ring '''Z&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;'''.

==Chinese multiplication table==
{{Main|Chinese multiplication table}}
The Chinese multiplication table consists of eighty-one sentences with four or five Chinese characters per sentence, making it easy for children to learn by heart. A shorter version of the table consists of only forty-five sentences, as terms such as "nine eights beget seventy-two" are identical to "eight nines beget seventy-two" so there is no need to learn them twice.

A bundle of 21 bamboo slips dated 305&amp;nbsp;BC in the [[Warring States]] period in the [[Tsinghua Bamboo Slips]] (清华简) collection is the world's earliest known example of a decimal multiplication table.&lt;ref&gt;''Nature'' article [http://www.nature.com/news/ancient-times-table-hidden-in-chinese-bamboo-strips-1.14482 The 2,300-year-old matrix is the world's oldest decimal multiplication table]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Standards-based mathematics reform in the US==
In 1989, the [[National Council of Teachers of Mathematics]] (NCTM) developed new standards which were based on the belief that all students should learn higher-order thinking skills, and which recommended reduced emphasis on the teaching of traditional methods that relied on rote memorization, such as multiplication tables. Widely adopted texts such as [[Investigations in Numbers, Data, and Space]] (widely known as [[Technical Education Research Centers|TERC]] after its producer, Technical Education Research Centers) omitted aids such as multiplication tables in early editions. NCTM made it clear in their 2006 [[Principles and Standards for School Mathematics#Curriculum Focal Points|Focal Points]] that basic mathematics facts must be learned, though there is no consensus on whether rote memorization is the best method.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6402">The '''Noether Lecture''' is an award and lecture series that honors women "who have made fundamental and sustained contributions to the mathematical sciences". The [[Association for Women in Mathematics]] (AWM) established the annual lectures in 1980 as the [[Emmy Noether]] Lectures, in honor of one of the leading mathematicians of her time. In 2013 it was renamed the AWM-AMS Noether Lecture and since 2015 is sponsored jointly with the [[American Mathematical Society]] (AMS). The recipient delivers the lecture at the yearly American [[Joint Mathematics Meetings]] held in January.&lt;ref name=NoetherAWM&gt;{{cite web |title=Noether Lecture |url=https://sites.google.com/site/awmmath/programs/noether-lectures |publisher=Association for Women in Mathematics |accessdate=19 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''ICM Emmy Noether Lecture''' is an additional lecture series sponsored by the [[International Mathematical Union]]. Beginning in 1994 an additional Emmy Noether Lecture was delivered at the [[International Congress of Mathematicians]] held every four years. In 2010 the lecture series was made permanent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=ICM Emmy Noether Lecture |url=http://www.mathunion.org/activities/icm/emmy-noether-lecture/ |publisher=International Mathematical Union |accessdate=19 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="36181">This article collects together a variety of [[mathematical proof|proofs]] of [[Fermat's little theorem]], which states that
:&lt;math&gt;a^p \equiv a \pmod p &lt;/math&gt;
for every [[prime number]] ''p'' and every [[integer]] ''a'' (see [[modular arithmetic]]).

==Simplifications==
Some of the '''proofs of Fermat's little theorem''' given below depend on two simplifications.

The first is that we may assume that {{mvar|a}} is in the range {{math|0 ≤ ''a'' ≤ ''p'' − 1}}. This is a simple consequence of the laws of [[modular arithmetic]]; we are simply saying that we may first reduce {{mvar|a}} modulo&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|p}}. This is consistent with reducing &lt;math&gt;a^p &lt;/math&gt; modulo&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|p}}, as one can check.

Secondly, it suffices to prove that
:&lt;math&gt;a^{p-1} \equiv 1 \pmod p&lt;/math&gt;
for {{mvar|a}} in the range {{math|1 ≤ ''a'' ≤ ''p'' − 1}}. Indeed, if the previous assertion holds for such {{mvar|a}}, multiplying both sides by {{math|''a''}} yields the original form of the theorem,
:&lt;math&gt;a^p \equiv a \pmod p &lt;/math&gt;
On the other hand, if {{math|''a'' {{=}} 0}}, the theorem holds trivially.

==Combinatorial proofs==

===Proof by counting necklaces===
This is perhaps the simplest known proof, requiring the least mathematical background. It is an attractive example of a [[combinatorial proof]] (a proof that involves [[Double counting (proof technique)|counting a collection of objects in two different ways]]).

The proof given here is an adaptation of [[Solomon W. Golomb|Golomb]]'s proof.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last = Golomb|first = Solomon W.|authorlink = Solomon W. Golomb|url = http://www.cimat.mx/~mmoreno/teaching/spring08/Fermats_Little_Thm.pdf|title = Combinatorial proof of Fermat's "Little" Theorem|journal = [[American Mathematical Monthly]]|volume = 63|issue = 10|year =1956|pages = 718|jstor = 2309563|doi = 10.2307/2309563}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To keep things simple, let us assume that {{mvar|a}} is a [[positive integer]]. Consider all the possible [[string (computer science)|strings]] of {{math|''p''}} symbols, using an [[alphabet]] with {{mvar|a}} different symbols. The total number of such strings is {{math|''a&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;''}}, since there are {{mvar|a}} possibilities for each of {{mvar|p}} positions (see [[rule of product]]).

For example, if {{math|''p''&amp;nbsp;{{=}}&amp;nbsp;5}} and {{math|''a'' {{=}} 2}}, then we can use an alphabet with two symbols (say {{mvar|A}} and {{mvar|B}}), and there are {{math|2&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;{{=}}&amp;nbsp;32}} strings of length 5:
: {{math|''AAAAA''}}, {{math|''AAAAB''}}, {{math|''AAABA''}}, {{math|''AAABB''}}, {{math|''AABAA''}}, {{math|''AABAB''}}, {{math|''AABBA''}}, {{math|''AABBB''}},
: {{math|''ABAAA''}}, {{math|''ABAAB''}}, {{math|''ABABA''}}, {{math|''ABABB''}}, {{math|''ABBAA''}}, {{math|''ABBAB''}}, {{math|''ABBBA''}}, {{math|''ABBBB''}},
: {{math|''BAAAA''}}, {{math|''BAAAB''}}, {{math|''BAABA''}}, {{math|''BAABB''}}, {{math|''BABAA''}}, {{math|''BABAB''}}, {{math|''BABBA''}}, {{math|''BABBB''}},
: {{math|''BBAAA''}}, {{math|''BBAAB''}}, {{math|''BBABA''}}, {{math|''BBABB''}}, {{math|''BBBAA''}}, {{math|''BBBAB''}}, {{math|''BBBBA''}}, {{math|''BBBBB''}}.

We will argue below that if we remove the strings consisting of a single symbol from the list (in our example, {{math|''AAAAA''}} and {{math|''BBBBB''}}), the remaining {{math|''a&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;'' − ''a''}} strings can be arranged into groups, each group containing exactly {{mvar|p}} strings. It follows that {{math|''a&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;'' − ''a''}} is divisible by {{mvar|p}}.

====Necklaces====
[[Image:Proofs-of-Fermats-Little-Theorem-bracelet1.svg|frame|right|Necklace representing seven different strings ({{math|''ABCBAAC''}}, {{math|''BCBAACA''}}, {{math|''CBAACAB''}}, {{math|''BAACABC''}}, {{math|''AACABCB''}}, {{math|''ACABCBA''}}, {{math|''CABCBAA''}})]]
[[Image:Proofs-of-Fermats-Little-Theorem-bracelet2.svg|frame|right|Necklace representing only one string ({{math|''AAAAAAA''}})]]

Let us think of each such string as representing a [[necklace (combinatorics)|necklace]]. That is, we connect the two ends of the string together and regard two strings as the same necklace if we can [[circular shift|rotate]] one string to obtain the second string; in this case we will say that the two strings are ''friends''. In our example, the following strings are all friends:
: {{math|''AAAAB''}}, {{math|''AAABA''}}, {{math|''AABAA''}}, {{math|''ABAAA''}}, {{math|''BAAAA''}}.
Similarly, each line of the following list corresponds to a single necklace.
: {{math|''AAABB''}}, {{math|''AABBA''}}, {{math|''ABBAA''}}, {{math|''BBAAA''}}, {{math|''BAAAB''}},
: {{math|''AABAB''}}, {{math|''ABABA''}}, {{math|''BABAA''}}, {{math|''ABAAB''}}, {{math|''BAABA''}},
: {{math|''AABBB''}}, {{math|''ABBBA''}}, {{math|''BBBAA''}}, {{math|''BBAAB''}}, {{math|''BAABB''}},
: {{math|''ABABB''}}, {{math|''BABBA''}}, {{math|''ABBAB''}}, {{math|''BBABA''}}, {{math|''BABAB''}},
: {{math|''ABBBB''}}, {{math|''BBBBA''}}, {{math|''BBBAB''}}, {{math|''BBABB''}}, {{math|''BABBB''}},
: {{math|''AAAAA''}},
: {{math|''BBBBB''}}.
Notice that in the above list, some necklaces are represented by 5 different strings, and some only by a single string, so the list shows very clearly why {{math|32&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;2}} is divisible by {{math|5}}.

One can use the following rule to work out how many friends a given string {{math|''S''}} has:
: If {{math|''S''}} is built up of several copies of the string {{math|''T''}}, and {{math|''T''}} cannot itself be broken down further into repeating strings, then the number of friends of {{math|''S''}} (including {{math|''S''}} itself) is equal to the ''length'' of {{math|''T''}}.

For example, suppose we start with the string {{math|''S''&amp;nbsp;{{=}}&amp;nbsp;''ABBABBABBABB''}}, which is built up of several copies of the shorter string {{math|''T''&amp;nbsp;{{=}}&amp;nbsp;''ABB''}}. If we rotate it one symbol at a time, we obtain the following 3 strings:
: {{math|''ABBABBABBABB''}},
: {{math|''BBABBABBABBA''}},
: {{math|''BABBABBABBAB''}}.
There aren't any others, because {{mvar|ABB}} is exactly 3 symbols long and cannot be broken down into further repeating strings.

====Completing the proof====
Using the above rule, we can complete the proof of Fermat's little theorem quite easily, as follows. Our starting pool of {{math|''a&lt;sup&gt; p&lt;/sup&gt;''}} strings may be split into two categories:
* Some strings contain {{mvar|p}} identical symbols. There are exactly {{mvar|a}} of these, one for each symbol in the alphabet. (In our running example, these are the strings {{mvar|AAAAA}} and {{mvar|BBBBB}}.)
* The rest of the strings use at least two distinct symbols from the alphabet. If we can break up {{mvar|S}} into repeating copies of some string {{mvar|T}}, the length of {{mvar|T}} must divide the length of {{mvar|S}}. But, since the length of {{mvar|S}} is the prime {{mvar|p}}, the only possible length for {{mvar|T}} is also {{mvar|p}}. Therefore, the above rule tells us that {{mvar|S}} has exactly {{mvar|p}} friends (including {{mvar|S}} itself).

The second category contains {{math|''a&lt;sup&gt; p&lt;/sup&gt;'' − ''a''}} strings, and they may be arranged into groups of {{mvar|p}} strings, one group for each necklace. Therefore, {{math|''a&lt;sup&gt; p&lt;/sup&gt;'' − ''a''}} must be divisible by {{mvar|p}}, as promised.

===Proof using dynamical systems===
This proof uses some basic concepts from [[dynamical system]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last = Iga|first = Kevin|title = A Dynamical Systems Proof of Fermat's Little Theorem|journal = [[Mathematics Magazine]]|volume = 76|issue = 1|year = 2003|pages = 48–51|doi = 10.2307/3219132|jstor = 3219132}}&lt;/ref&gt;

We start by considering a family of [[function (mathematics)|functions]] ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x''), where ''n'' ≥ 2 is an [[integer]], mapping the [[interval (mathematics)|interval]] [0, 1] to itself by the formula
:&lt;math&gt;T_n(x) = \begin{cases}
 \{ nx \} &amp; 0 \leq x &lt; 1, \\
 1        &amp; x = 1,
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;
where {''y''} denotes the [[fractional part]] of ''y''. For example, the function ''T''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'') is illustrated below:

[[Image:Proofs-of-Fermats-Little-Theorem-dynamic1.png|200px|center|An example of a ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; function]]

A number ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is said to be a ''[[fixed point (mathematics)|fixed point]]'' of a function ''f''(''x'') if ''f''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) = ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;; in other words, if ''f'' leaves ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; fixed. The fixed points of a function can be easily found graphically: they are simply the ''x'' coordinates of the points where the [[Graph of a function|graph]] of ''f''(''x'') intersects the graph of the line ''y'' = ''x''. For example, the fixed points of the function ''T''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'') are 0, 1/2, and 1; they are marked by black circles on the following diagram:

[[Image:Proofs-of-Fermats-Little-Theorem-dynamic2.png|180px|center|Fixed points of a ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; function]]

We will require the following two lemmas.

'''Lemma 1.''' For any ''n'' ≥ 2, the function ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'') has exactly ''n'' fixed points.

'''Proof.''' There are 3 fixed points in the illustration above, and the same sort of geometrical argument applies for any ''n'' ≥ 2.

'''Lemma 2.''' For any positive integers ''n'' and ''m'', and any 0 ≤ x ≤ 1,
:&lt;math&gt;T_m(T_n(x)) = T_{mn}(x).&lt;/math&gt;
In other words, ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''mn''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'') is the [[function composition|composition]] of ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'') and ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'').

'''Proof.''' The proof of this lemma is not difficult, but we need to be slightly careful with the endpoint ''x'' = 1. For this point the lemma is clearly true, since
:&lt;math&gt;T_m(T_n(1)) = T_m(1) = 1 = T_{mn}(1).&lt;/math&gt;
So let us assume that 0 ≤ ''x'' &lt; 1. In this case,
:&lt;math&gt;T_n(x) = \{nx\} &lt; 1, &lt;/math&gt;
so ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;(''T''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'')) is given by
:&lt;math&gt;T_m(T_n(x)) = \{m\{nx\}\}.&lt;/math&gt;
Therefore, what we really need to show is that
:&lt;math&gt;\{m\{nx\}\} = \{mnx\}.&lt;/math&gt;
To do this we observe that {''nx''} = ''nx'' − ''k'', where ''k'' is the [[integer part]] of ''nx''; then
:&lt;math&gt;\{m\{nx\}\} = \{mnx - mk\} = \{mnx\},&lt;/math&gt;
since ''mk'' is an integer.

Now let us properly begin the proof of Fermat's little theorem, by studying the function ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;(''x''). We will assume that ''a'' ≥ 2. From Lemma 1, we know that it has ''a''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; fixed points. By Lemma 2 we know that
:&lt;math&gt;T_{a^p}(x) = \underbrace{T_a(T_a( \cdots T_a(x) \cdots ))}_{p\text{ times}},&lt;/math&gt;
so any fixed point of ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'') is automatically a fixed point of ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'').

We are interested in the fixed points of ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'') that are ''not'' fixed points of ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x''). Let us call the set of such points ''S''. There are ''a''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; − ''a'' points in ''S'', because by Lemma 1 again, ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'') has exactly ''a'' fixed points. The following diagram illustrates the situation for ''a'' = 3 and ''p'' = 2. The black circles are the points of ''S'', of which there are 3&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; − 3 = 6.

[[Image:Proofs-of-Fermats-Little-Theorem-dynamic3.png|250px|center|Fixed points in the set ''S'']]

The main idea of the proof is now to split the set ''S'' up into its [[orbit (dynamics)|orbits]] under ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt;. What this means is that we pick a point ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; in ''S'', and repeatedly apply ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt;(x) to it, to obtain the sequence of points
:&lt;math&gt; x_0, T_a(x_0), T_a(T_a(x_0)), T_a(T_a(T_a(x_0))), \ldots. &lt;/math&gt;
This sequence is called the orbit of ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; under ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt;. By Lemma 2, this sequence can be rewritten as
:&lt;math&gt; x_0, T_a(x_0), T_{a^2}(x_0), T_{a^3}(x_0), \ldots. &lt;/math&gt;
Since we are assuming that ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is a fixed point of ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;sup&gt; ''p''&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;(''x''), after ''p'' steps we hit ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;(''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) = ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, and from that point onwards the sequence repeats itself.

However, the sequence ''cannot'' begin repeating itself any earlier than that. If it did, the length of the repeating section would have to be a divisor of ''p'', so it would have to be 1 (since ''p'' is prime). But this contradicts our assumption that ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is not a fixed point of ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt;.

In other words, the orbit contains exactly ''p'' distinct points. This holds for every orbit of ''S''. Therefore, the set ''S'', which contains ''a''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''a'' points, can be broken up into orbits, each containing ''p'' points, so ''a''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''a'' is divisible by ''p''.

(This proof is essentially the same as the [[Proofs of Fermat's little theorem#Proof by counting necklaces|necklace-counting proof]] given above, simply viewed through a different lens: one may think of the interval [0,&amp;nbsp;1] as given by sequences of digits in base ''a'' (our distinction between 0 and 1 corresponding to the familiar distinction between representing integers as ending in ".0000..." and ".9999..."). ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; amounts to shifting such a sequence by ''n'' many digits. The fixed points of this will be sequences that are cyclic with period dividing ''n''. In particular, the fixed points of ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; can be thought of as the necklaces of length ''p'', with ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; corresponding to rotation of such necklaces by ''n'' spots.

This proof could also be presented without distinguishing between 0 and 1, simply using the half-open interval [0, 1); then ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; would only have ''n'' − 1 fixed points, but ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; − ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt; would still work out to ''a''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; − ''a'', as needed.)

===Multinomial proofs===

====Proof using the binomial theorem====
This proof, due to [[Leonhard Euler|Euler]],&lt;ref name="Dickson"/&gt; uses [[mathematical induction|induction]] to prove the theorem for all integers {{math|''a''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;0}}.

The base step, that {{math|0&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;≡&amp;nbsp;0 (mod&amp;nbsp;''p'')}}, is trivial. Next, we must show that if the theorem is true for {{math|''a''&amp;nbsp;{{=}}&amp;nbsp;''k''}}, then it is also true for {{math|''a''&amp;nbsp;{{=}}&amp;nbsp;''k''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1}}. For this inductive step, we need the following lemma.

'''Lemma'''. For any integers {{math|''x''}} and {{math|''y''}} and for any prime {{math|''p''}}, {{math|(''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''y'')&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;≡&amp;nbsp;''x&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''y&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;''&amp;nbsp;(mod&amp;nbsp;''p'')}}.

The lemma is a case of the [[freshman's dream]]. Leaving the proof for later on, we proceed with the induction.

'''Proof'''. Assume ''k''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; ≡ ''k'' (mod ''p''), and consider (''k''+1)&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt;. By the lemma we have

:&lt;math&gt;(k+1)^p \equiv k^p + 1^p \pmod{p}.&lt;/math&gt;

Using the induction hypothesis, we have that ''k''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; ≡ ''k'' (mod ''p''); and, trivially, 1&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; = 1. Thus

:&lt;math&gt;(k+1)^p \equiv k + 1 \pmod{p},&lt;/math&gt;

which is the statement of the theorem for ''a'' = ''k''+1. ∎

In order to prove the lemma, we must introduce the [[binomial theorem]], which states that for any positive integer ''n'',

:&lt;math&gt;(x+y)^n=\sum_{i=0}^n{n \choose i}x^{n-i}y^i,&lt;/math&gt;

where the coefficients are the [[binomial coefficients]],

:&lt;math&gt;{n \choose i}=\frac{n!}{i!(n-i)!},&lt;/math&gt;

described in terms of the [[factorial]] function, ''n''! = 1×2×3×⋯×''n''.

'''Proof of Lemma.''' We consider the binomial coefficient when the exponent is a prime ''p'':

:&lt;math&gt;{p \choose i}=\frac{p!}{i!(p-i)!}&lt;/math&gt;

The binomial coefficients are all integers.  The numerator contains a factor ''p'' by the definition of factorial.  When 0 &lt; ''i'' &lt; ''p'', neither of the terms in the denominator includes a factor of ''p'' (relying on the primality of ''p''), leaving the coefficient itself to possess a prime factor of ''p'' from the numerator, implying that

:&lt;math&gt;{p \choose i} \equiv 0 \pmod{p},\qquad 0 &lt; i &lt; p.&lt;/math&gt;

Modulo ''p'', this eliminates all but the first and last terms of the sum on the right-hand side of the binomial theorem for prime ''p''. ∎

The primality of ''p'' is essential to the lemma; otherwise, we have examples like

:&lt;math&gt;{4 \choose 2} = 6,&lt;/math&gt;

which is not divisible by 4.

====Proof using the multinomial expansion====
The proof, which was first discovered by [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] (who did not publish it)&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last = Vacca|first = Giovanni|author-link = Giovanni Vacca (mathematician)|journal = Bibliotheca Mathematica| series = 2nd series|volume = 8|issue = 2|pages = 46–48|language = italian|year = 1894|title = Intorno alla prima dimostrazione di un teorema di Fermat}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later rediscovered by [[Leonhard Euler|Euler]],&lt;ref name="Dickson"/&gt; is a very simple application of the [[multinomial theorem]] which is brought here for the sake of simplicity.

:&lt;math&gt;(x_1 + x_2 + \cdots + x_m)^n
 = \sum_{k_1,k_2,\ldots,k_m} {n \choose k_1, k_2, \ldots, k_m}
 x_1^{k_1} x_2^{k_2} \cdots x_m^{k_m}. &lt;/math&gt;

The summation is taken over all sequences of nonnegative integer indices {{math|''k''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} through {{math|''k&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;''}} such the sum of all {{math|''k&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is {{math|''n''}}.

Thus if we express {{math|''a''}} as a sum of 1s (ones), we obtain

:&lt;math&gt;a^p
 = \sum_{k_1,k_2,\ldots,k_a} {p \choose k_1, k_2, \ldots, k_a} &lt;/math&gt;

Clearly, if {{math|''p''}} is prime, and if {{math|''k&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is not equal to {{math|''p''}} for any {{math|''j''}}, we have

:&lt;math&gt;{p \choose k_1, k_2, \ldots, k_a} \equiv 0 \pmod p &lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;{p \choose k_1, k_2, \ldots, k_a} \equiv 1 \pmod p &lt;/math&gt;

if {{math|''k&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is equal to {{math|''p''}} for some {{math|''j''}}.

Since there are exactly {{math|''a''}} elements such that {{math|''k&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;nbsp;{{=}}&amp;nbsp;''p''}}, the theorem follows.

(This proof is essentially a coarser-grained variant of the [[Proofs of Fermat's little theorem#Proof by counting necklaces|necklace-counting proof]] given earlier; the multinomial coefficients count the number of ways a string can be permuted into arbitrary anagrams, while the necklace argument counts the number of ways a string can be rotated into cyclic anagrams. That is to say, that the nontrivial multinomial coefficients here are divisible by {{math|''p''}} can be seen as a consequence of the fact that each nontrivial necklace of length {{math|''p''}} can be unwrapped into a string in {{math|''p''}} many ways.

This multinomial expansion is also, of course, what essentially underlies the [[Proofs of Fermat's little theorem#Proof using the binomial theorem|binomial theorem-based proof]] above)

===Proof using power product expansions===

An additive-combinatorial proof based on formal power product expansions was given by Giedrius Alkauskas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last = Alkauskas|first = Giedrius|arxiv = 0801.0805|title = A Curious Proof of Fermat’s Little Theorem|journal = [[American Mathematical Monthly]]|volume = 116|issue = 4|year = 2009|pages = 362–364|jstor = 40391097|doi=10.4169/193009709x470236}}&lt;/ref&gt; This proof uses neither the [[Euclidean algorithm]] nor the [[binomial theorem]], but rather it employs [[formal power series]] with rational coefficients.

Let us assume that {{math|''a''}} is positive and not divisible by {{math|''p''}}.
&lt;!--
NOTE:
Of course this proof also works for negative ''a''. However, I'm really just trying to strip it down to the simplest possible version, that people only marginally familiar with modular arithmetic will understand. I didn't want to get stuck with stuff like "replace ka by its representative in the set {1, 2, ... p-1}. (Dmharvey)

What if a is divisible by p?
--&gt;
The idea is that if we write down the sequence of numbers
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;a, 2a, 3a, \ldots, (p-1)a&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|A}}}}
and reduce each one modulo {{math|''p''}}, the resulting sequence turns out to be a rearrangement of
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;1, 2, 3, \ldots, p-1.&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|B}}}}
Therefore, if we multiply together the numbers in each sequence, the results must be identical modulo {{math|''p''}}:
:&lt;math&gt;a \times 2a \times 3a \times \cdots \times (p-1)a \equiv 1 \times 2 \times 3 \times \cdots \times (p-1) \pmod p.&lt;/math&gt;
Collecting together the {{math|''a''}} terms yields
:&lt;math&gt;a^{p-1} (p-1)! \equiv (p-1)! \pmod p.&lt;/math&gt;
Finally, we may “cancel out” the numbers {{math|1, 2, ..., ''p'' − 1}} from both sides of this equation, obtaining
:&lt;math&gt;a^{p-1} \equiv 1 \pmod p.&lt;/math&gt;

There are two steps in the above proof that we need to justify:
* Why the elements of the sequence ({{EquationNote|A}}), reduced modulo {{mvar|p}}, are a rearrangement of ({{EquationNote|B}}), and
* Why it is valid to “cancel” in the setting of modular arithmetic.
We will prove these things below; let us first see an example of this proof in action.

===An example===

If {{math|''a''&amp;nbsp;{{=}}&amp;nbsp;3}} and {{math|''p''&amp;nbsp;{{=}}&amp;nbsp;7}}, then the sequence in question is
:&lt;math&gt;3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18;&lt;/math&gt;
reducing modulo&amp;nbsp;7 gives
:&lt;math&gt;3, 6, 2, 5, 1, 4,&lt;/math&gt;
which is just a rearrangement of
:&lt;math&gt;1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.&lt;/math&gt;
Multiplying them together gives
:&lt;math&gt;3 \times 6 \times 9 \times 12 \times 15 \times 18 \equiv 3 \times 6 \times 2 \times 5 \times 1 \times 4 \equiv 1 \times 2 \times 3 \times 4 \times 5 \times 6 \pmod 7;&lt;/math&gt;
that is,
:&lt;math&gt;3^6 (1 \times 2 \times 3 \times 4 \times 5 \times 6) \equiv (1 \times 2 \times 3 \times 4 \times 5 \times 6) \pmod 7.&lt;/math&gt;
Canceling out 1&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;2&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;3&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;4&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;5&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;6 yields
:&lt;math&gt;3^6 \equiv 1 \pmod 7, &lt;/math&gt;
which is Fermat's little theorem for the case {{math|''a''&amp;nbsp;{{=}}&amp;nbsp;3}} and&amp;nbsp;{{math|''p''&amp;nbsp;{{=}}&amp;nbsp;7}}.

===The cancellation law===

Let us first explain why it is valid, in certain situations, to “cancel”. The exact statement is as follows. If {{math|''u''}}, {{math|''x''}}, and&amp;nbsp;{{math|''y''}} are integers, and {{math|''u''}} is not divisible by a prime number {{math|''p''}}, and if
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;ux \equiv uy \pmod p,&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|C}}}}
then we may “cancel” {{math|''u''}} to obtain
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;x \equiv y \pmod p.&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|D}}}}
Our use of this '''cancellation law''' in the above proof of Fermat's little theorem was valid, because the numbers {{math|1, 2, ..., ''p''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1}} are certainly not divisible by {{math|''p''}} (indeed they are ''smaller'' than {{math|''p''}}).

We can prove the cancellation law easily using [[Euclid's lemma]], which generally states that if a prime {{math|''p''}} divides a product {{math|''ab''}} (where {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}} are integers), then {{math|''p''}} must divide {{math|''a''}} or {{math|''b''}}. Indeed, the assertion ({{EquationNote|C}}) simply means that {{math|''p''}} divides {{math|''ux'' − ''uy'' {{=}} ''u''(''x'' − ''y'')}}. Since {{math|''p''}} is a prime which does not divide {{math|''u''}}, Euclid's lemma tells us that it must divide {{math|''x''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''y''}} instead; that is, ({{EquationNote|D}}) holds.

Note that the conditions under which the cancellation law holds are quite strict, and this explains why Fermat's little theorem demands that {{mvar|p}} is a prime. For example, {{math|2×2 ≡ 2×5 (mod 6)}}, but it is not true that {{math|2 ≡ 5 (mod 6)}}. However, the following generalization of the cancellation law holds: if {{mvar|u}}, {{mvar|x}}, {{mvar|y}}, and {{mvar|z}} are integers, if {{mvar|u}} and {{mvar|z}} are [[Coprime integers|relatively prime]], and if
:&lt;math&gt;ux \equiv uy \pmod z,&lt;/math&gt;
then we may “cancel” {{mvar|''u''}} to obtain
:&lt;math&gt;x \equiv y \pmod z.&lt;/math&gt;
This follows from a [[Euclid's lemma#Proof|generalization of Euclid's lemma]].

===The rearrangement property===

Finally, we must explain why the sequence
:&lt;math&gt;a, 2a, 3a, \ldots, (p-1)a, &lt;/math&gt;
when reduced modulo ''p'', becomes a rearrangement of the sequence
:&lt;math&gt;1, 2, 3, \ldots, p-1.&lt;/math&gt;
To start with, none of the terms {{math|''a''}}, {{math|2''a''}}, ..., {{math|(''p''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1)''a''}} can be congruent to zero modulo {{math|''p''}}, since if {{math|''k''}} is one of the numbers {{math|1,&amp;nbsp;2,&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;''p''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1}}, then {{math|''k''}} is relatively prime with {{math|''p''}}, and so is {{math|''a''}}, so [[Euclid's lemma]] tells us that {{math|''ka''}} shares no factor with {{math|''p''}}. Therefore, at least we know that the numbers {{math|''a''}}, {{math|2''a''}}, ..., {{math|(''p''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1)''a''}}, when reduced modulo {{math|''p''}}, must be found among the numbers {{math|1,&amp;nbsp;2,&amp;nbsp;3,&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;''p''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1}}.

Furthermore, the numbers {{math|''a''}}, {{math|2''a''}}, ..., {{math|(''p''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1)''a''}} must all be ''distinct'' after reducing them modulo {{math|''p''}}, because if
:&lt;math&gt;ka \equiv ma \pmod p, &lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|''k''}} and {{math|''m''}} are one of {{math|1,&amp;nbsp;2,&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;''p''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1}}, then the cancellation law tells us that
:&lt;math&gt;k \equiv m \pmod p. &lt;/math&gt;
Since both {{math|''k''}} and {{math|''m''}} are between {{math|1}} and {{math|''p''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1}}, they must be equal. Therefore, the terms {{math|''a''}}, {{math|2''a''}}, ..., {{math|(''p''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1)''a''}} when reduced modulo {{math|''p''}} must be distinct. 
To summarise: when we reduce the {{math|''p''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1}} numbers {{math|''a''}}, {{math|2''a''}}, ..., {{math|(''p''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1)''a''}} modulo {{math|''p''}}, we obtain distinct members of the sequence {{math|1}},&amp;nbsp;{{math|2}},&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;{{math|''p''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1}}. Since there are exactly {{math|''p''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1}} of these, the only possibility is that the former are a rearrangement of the latter.

===Applications to Euler's theorem===

This method can also be used to prove [[Euler's theorem]], with a slight alteration in that the numbers from {{math|1}} to {{math|''p'' − 1}} are substituted by the numbers less than and coprime with some number {{mvar|m}} (not necessarily prime). Both the rearrangement property and the cancellation law (under the generalized form mentioned [[#The cancellation law|above]]) are still satisfied and can be utilized.

For example, if {{math|''m'' {{=}} 10}}, then the numbers less than&amp;nbsp;{{math|''m''}} and coprime with {{math|''m''}} are {{math|1}}, {{math|3}}, {{math|7}}, and {{math|9}}. Thus we have:
:&lt;math&gt;a \times 3a \times 7a \times 9a \equiv 1 \times 3 \times 7 \times 9 \pmod {10}. &lt;/math&gt;

Therefore,
:&lt;math&gt;{a^{\varphi(10)}} \equiv 1 \pmod {10}. &lt;/math&gt;

==Proofs using group theory==

===Standard proof===
This proof&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last = Weil|first = André|author-link = André Weil|last2 = Rosenlicht|first2 = Maxwell|authorlink2 = Maxwell Rosenlicht|title = Number Theory for beginners|year = 1979|publisher = [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer-Verlag]]|isbn = 978-0-387-90381-1|doi = 10.1007/978-1-4612-9957-8|section = §&amp;nbsp;VIII|zbl = 0405.10001}}&lt;/ref&gt; requires the most basic elements of [[group theory]].

The idea is to recognise that the set {{math|''G''&amp;nbsp;{{=}}&amp;nbsp;{1, 2, …, ''p'' − 1}}}, with the operation of multiplication (taken modulo {{math|''p''}}), forms a [[group (mathematics)|group]]. The only group axiom that requires some effort to verify is that each element of {{math|''G''}} is invertible. Taking this on faith for the moment, let us assume that {{math|''a''}} is in the range {{math|1 ≤ ''a'' ≤ ''p'' − 1}}, that is, {{math|''a''}} is an element of {{math|''G''}}. Let {{math|''k''}} be the [[order (group theory)|order]] of {{math|''a''}}, that is, {{math|''k''}} is the smallest positive integer such that {{math|''a&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt;''&amp;nbsp;≡&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;(mod&amp;nbsp;''p'')}}. Then the numbers {{math|1, ''a'', ''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, ..., ''a''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&amp;nbsp;−1&lt;/sup&gt;}} reduced modulo&amp;nbsp;{{math|''p''}} form a [[subgroup]] of&amp;nbsp;{{math|''G''}} whose [[Order (group theory)|order]] is&amp;nbsp;{{math|''k''}} and therefore, by [[Lagrange's theorem (group theory)|Lagrange's theorem]], {{math|''k''}} divides the order of {{math|''G''}}, which is {{math|''p''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1}}. So {{math|''p''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;{{=}}&amp;nbsp;''km''}} for some positive integer {{math|''m''}} and then
:&lt;math&gt;a^{p-1} \equiv a^{km} \equiv (a^k)^m \equiv 1^m \equiv 1 \pmod p. &lt;/math&gt;

To prove that every element {{math|''b''}} of {{math|''G''}} is invertible, we may proceed as follows. First, {{math|''b''}} is [[Coprime integers|coprime]] to {{math|''p''}}. Thus [[Bézout's identity]] assures us that there are integers {{math|''x''}} and {{math|''y''}} such that {{math|''bx''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''py''&amp;nbsp;{{=}}&amp;nbsp;1}}. Reading this equality modulo {{math|''p''}}, we see that {{math|''x''}} is an inverse for {{math|''b''}}, since {{math|''bx''&amp;nbsp;≡&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;(mod&amp;nbsp;''p'')}}. Therefore, every element of {{math|''G''}} is invertible. So, as remarked earlier, {{math|''G''}} is a group.

For example, when {{math|''p'' {{=}} 11}}, the inverses of each element are given as follows:
:{| border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="8"
| align="center" | {{math|''a''}}
| 1 || 2 || 3 || 4 || 5 || 6 || 7 || 8 || 9 || 10
|-
| align="center" | {{math|''a''&lt;sup&gt; −1&lt;/sup&gt;}}
| 1 || 6 || 4 || 3 || 9 || 2 || 8 || 7 || 5 || 10
|}

===Euler's proof===
If we take the previous proof and, instead of using Lagrange's theorem, we try to prove it in this specific situation, then we get Euler's third proof, which is the one that he found more natural.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last = Weil|first = André|author-link = André Weil|title = Number theory: An approach through history; from [[Hammurabi|Hammurapi]] to [[Adrien-Marie Legendre|Legendre]]|publisher = [[Birkhäuser]]|year = 2007|isbn = 978-0-8176-4565-6|section = §&amp;nbsp;III.VI|zbl = 1149.01013|origyear = 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last = Euler|first = Leonhard|author-link = Leonhard Euler|title = Theoremata circa residua ex divisione potestatum relicta|language = latin|url = http://math.dartmouth.edu/~euler/docs/originals/E262.pdf|journal = Novi Commentarii academiae scientiarum Petropolitanae|volume = 7|year = 1761|pages = 49–82}}&lt;/ref&gt; Let {{math|''A''}} be the set whose elements are the numbers {{math|1, ''a'', ''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, ..., ''a''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1&lt;/sup&gt;}} reduced modulo&amp;nbsp;{{math|''p''}}. If {{math|''A''&amp;nbsp;{{=}}&amp;nbsp;''G''}}, then {{math|''k''&amp;nbsp;{{=}}&amp;nbsp;''p''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1}} and therefore {{math|''k''}} divides {{math|''p''&amp;nbsp;−1}}. Otherwise, there is some {{math|''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''G''\''A''}}.

Let {{math|''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} be the set whose elements are the numbers {{math|''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''ab''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, &amp;hellip;, ''a''&lt;sup&gt;''k'' − 1&lt;/sup&gt;''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} reduced modulo&amp;nbsp;{{math|''p''}}. Then {{math|''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} has {{math|''k''}} distinct elements, because otherwise there would be two distinct numbers {{math|''m'', ''n''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;{0, 1, ..., ''k'' − 1}}} such that {{math|''a&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ≡ ''a&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; (mod ''p'')}}, which is impossible, since it would follow that {{math|''a&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;'' ≡ ''a&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;'' (mod ''p'')}}. On the other hand, no element of {{math|''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} can be an element of {{math|''A''}}, because otherwise there would be numbers {{math|''m'', ''n''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;{0, 1, &amp;hellip;, ''k''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1}}} such that {{math|''a&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ≡ ''a&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;'' (mod ''p'')}}, and then {{math|''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ≡ ''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''a&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;a''&lt;sup&gt;''k'' − ''m''&lt;/sup&gt; ≡ ''a''&lt;sup&gt;''n'' + ''k'' − ''m''&lt;/sup&gt; (mod ''p'')}}, which is impossible, since {{math|''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ∉ ''A''}}.

So, the set {{math|''A''∪''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} has {{math|2''k''}} elements. If it turns out to be equal to&amp;nbsp;''G'', then {{math|2''k''&amp;nbsp;{{=}}&amp;nbsp;''p''&amp;nbsp;−1}} and therefore {{math|''k''}} divides {{math|''p''&amp;nbsp;−1}}. Otherwise, there is some {{math|''b''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''G''\(''A''∪''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)}} and we can start all over again, defining {{math|''A''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} as the set whose elements are the numbers {{math|''b''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''ab''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''b''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''a''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1&lt;/sup&gt;''b''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} reduced modulo&amp;nbsp;{{math|''p''}}. Since {{math|''G''}} is finite, this process must stop at some point and this proves that {{math|''k''}} divides {{math|''p''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1}}.

For instance, if {{math|''a'' {{=}} 5}} and {{math|''p'' {{=}} 13}}, then, since
* {{math|5&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;{{=}}&amp;nbsp;25&amp;nbsp;≡&amp;nbsp;12&amp;nbsp;(mod&amp;nbsp;13)}},
* {{math|5&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;{{=}}&amp;nbsp;125&amp;nbsp;≡&amp;nbsp;8&amp;nbsp;(mod&amp;nbsp;13)}},
* {{math|5&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;{{=}}&amp;nbsp;625&amp;nbsp;≡&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;(mod&amp;nbsp;13)}},
we have {{math|''k''&amp;nbsp;{{=}}&amp;nbsp;4}} and {{math|''A''&amp;nbsp;{{=}}&amp;nbsp;{1,&amp;nbsp;5,&amp;nbsp;8,&amp;nbsp;12}}}. Clearly, {{math|''A''&amp;nbsp;≠&amp;nbsp;''G''&amp;nbsp;{{=}}&amp;nbsp;{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12}}}. Let {{math|''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} be an element of {{math|''G''\''A''}}; for instance, take {{math|''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;{{=}}&amp;nbsp;2}}. Then, since
* {{math|2×1&amp;nbsp;{{=}}&amp;nbsp;2}},
* {{math|2×5&amp;nbsp;{{=}}&amp;nbsp;10}},
* {{math|2×8&amp;nbsp;{{=}}&amp;nbsp;16&amp;nbsp;≡&amp;nbsp;3&amp;nbsp;(mod&amp;nbsp;13)}},
* {{math|2×12&amp;nbsp;{{=}}&amp;nbsp;24&amp;nbsp;≡&amp;nbsp;11&amp;nbsp;(mod&amp;nbsp;13)}},
we have {{math|''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;{{=}}&amp;nbsp;{2,&amp;nbsp;3,&amp;nbsp;10,&amp;nbsp;11}}}. Clearly, {{math|''A''∪''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ≠ ''G''}}. Let {{math|''b''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} be an element of {{math|''G''\(''A''∪''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)}}; for instance, take {{math|''b''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}}&amp;nbsp;4}}. Then, since
* {{math|4×1&amp;nbsp;{{=}}&amp;nbsp;4}},
* {{math|4×5&amp;nbsp;{{=}}&amp;nbsp;20&amp;nbsp;≡&amp;nbsp;7&amp;nbsp;(mod&amp;nbsp;13)}},
* {{math|4×8&amp;nbsp;{{=}}&amp;nbsp;32&amp;nbsp;≡&amp;nbsp;6&amp;nbsp;(mod&amp;nbsp;13)}},
* {{math|4×12&amp;nbsp;{{=}}&amp;nbsp;48&amp;nbsp;≡&amp;nbsp;9&amp;nbsp;(mod&amp;nbsp;13)}},
we have {{math|''A''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;{{=}}&amp;nbsp;{4,&amp;nbsp;6,&amp;nbsp;7,&amp;nbsp;9}}}. And now {{math|''G''&amp;nbsp;{{=}}&amp;nbsp;''A''∪''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;∪''A''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}.

Note that the sets {{math|''A''}}, {{math|''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}, and so on are in fact the [[coset]]s of {{math|''A''}} in {{math|''G''}}.

In mathematics, the '''''q''-Hahn polynomials'''  are a family of basic hypergeometric [[orthogonal polynomials]] in the basic [[Askey scheme]]. {{harvs|txt | last1=Koekoek | first1=Roelof | last2=Lesky | first2=Peter A. | last3=Swarttouw | first3=René F. | title=Hypergeometric orthogonal polynomials and their q-analogues | publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]] | location=Berlin, New York | series=Springer Monographs in Mathematics | isbn=978-3-642-05013-8 | doi=10.1007/978-3-642-05014-5 | mr=2656096 | year=2010|loc=14}} give a detailed list of their properties.

==Definition==

The  polynomials are given in terms of [[basic hypergeometric function]]s and the [[Pochhammer symbol]] by 
&lt;math&gt;Q_n(x;a,b,N;q)=\;_{3}\phi_2\left[\begin{matrix} 
q^-n &amp; abq^n+1 &amp;  x \\ 
aq &amp; q^-N  \end{matrix} 
; q,q \right] &lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8573">Quantum Readout is a method to verify the authenticity of an object. The method is secure provided that the object cannot be copied or physically emulated.

==Hands-off versus hands-on authentication of objects==
When authenticating an object, one can distinguish two cases.
* Hands-on athentication: The object is fully under the control of the verifier. The verifier can see if the object is of the correct type, size, weight etc.. E.g. he can see the difference between a real tooth and a hologram representing the tooth. 
* Hands-off authentication: The verifier does not have full control. E.g. he has line-of-sight but cannot touch the object.

In the hands-on scenario, [[Physical Unclonable Function]]s (PUFs) of various types can serve as great authentication tokens. Their physical unclonability, combined with the verifier's ability to detect spoofing, makes it exceedingly hard for an attacker to create an object that will pass as a PUF clone. However, hands-on authentication requires that the holder of the PUF relinquishes control of it, which may not be acceptable, especially if there is the risk that the verifier is an [[impostor]].

In the hands-off scenario, however, reliable authentication is much more difficult to achieve. It is prudent to assume that the challenge-response behavior of each PUF is known publicly. (An attacker may get hold of a genuine PUF for a while and perform a lot of measurements on it without being discovered.) This is a "worst case" assumption as customary in security research. It poses no problem in the hands-on case, but in the hands-off case it means that spoofing becomes a real danger. Imagine for instance authentication of an [[Physical Unclonable Function#Optical PUF|optical PUF]] through a glass fiber.
The attacker does not have the PUF, but he knows everything about it. He receives the challenge (laser light) through the fiber. Instead of scattering the light off a physical object, he does the following:
(i) measure the incoming wave front; 
(ii) look up the corresponding response in his database; 
(iii) prepare laser light in the correct response state and send it back to the verifier.
This attack is known as "digital emulation".

For a long time spoofing in the hands-off scenario has seemed to be a fundamental problem that
cannot be solved.
The traditional approach to remote object authentication is to somehow enforce a
hands-on environment, e.g. by having a tamper-proof trusted remote device probing the object.
Drawbacks of this approach are (a) cost and (b) unknown degree of security in the face of ever more sophisticated attacks.

==Quantum-physical readout of a PUF==

=== The basic scheme ===
The problem of spoofing in the hands-off case can be solved using two
fundamental information-theoretic properties of quantum physics:
(1) A single quantum in an unknown state cannot be cloned.&lt;ref&gt;
W.K. Wootters and W.H. Zurek. "A single quantum cannot be cloned". Nature, 299: 802–803, 
1982&lt;/ref&gt;
(2) When a quantum state is measured most of the information it contains
is destroyed.

Based on these principles, the following scheme was proposed.&lt;ref&gt;
B. &amp;#352;kori&amp;#263;, "Quantum Readout of Physical Unclonable Functions", International Journal of 
Quantum Information, 10(1):1250001–1 – 125001–31, 2012.
&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Enrollment'''. The usual PUF enrollment. No quantum physics needed. The enrollment data is considered public.
# '''Challenge'''. A single quantum (e.g. a photon) is prepared in a random state. It is sent to the PUF.
# '''Response'''. The quantum interacts with the PUF (e.g. coherent scattering), resulting in a unitary transform of the state.
# '''Verification'''. The quantum is returned to the verifier. He knows exactly what the response state should be. This knowledge enables him to perform a "yes/no" verification measurement. 
Steps 2-4 are repeated multiple times in order to exponentially lower the false accept probability.

The crucial point is that the attacker cannot determine what the actual challenge is, because
that information is packaged in a "fragile" quantum state. 
If he tries to investigate the challenge state by measuring it, he destroys part of the information.
Not knowing where exactly to look in his challenge-response database, the attacker cannot reliably produce correct responses. 

A continuous-variable quantum authentication of PUFs has been also proposed in the literature, which relies on standard wave-front shaping and homodyne detection techniques&lt;ref&gt;Georgios M. Nikolopoulos and E. Diamanti, [http://www.nature.com/articles/srep46047 "Continuous-variable quantum authentication of physical unclonable keys"], ''Scientific reports'', 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Security assumptions ===
The scheme is secure only if the following conditions are met,
* Physical unclonability of the PUF.
* The attacker cannot perform arbitrary unitary transformations on the challenge quantum (i.e. physical emulation of the PUF is supposed to be infeasible).

In multiple-scattering optical systems the above requirements can be met in practice.

Quantum Readout of PUFs is ''unconditionally'' secure against digital emulation, but 
''conditionally'' against 
physical cloning and physical emulation.

=== Special security properties ===
Quantum Readout of PUFs achieves
* Hands-off object authentication without trusted hardware at the side of the object.
* Authentication of a quantum communication channel ''without a priori shared secrets'' and ''without shared entangled particles''. The authentication is based on public information.

Imagine Alice and Bob wish to engage in [[Quantum key distribution]] on an ad hoc basis, i.e. without ever having exchanged data or matter in the past. They both have an enrolled optical PUF.
They look up each other's PUF enrollment data from a trusted source.
They run quantum key distribution ''through'' both optical PUFs;
with a slight modification of the protocol, they get quantum key distribution and
two-way authentication. 
The security of their key distribution is unconditional,
but the security of the authentication is conditional on the two assumptions mentioned above.

=== Experimental realization ===
Quantum Readout of speckle-based optical PUFs has been demonstrated in the lab.&lt;ref&gt;
S.A. Goorden, M. Horstmann, A.P. Mosk, B. &amp;#352;kori&amp;#263;, P.W.H. Pinkse,
"Quantum-Secure Authentication with a Classical Key",
https://arxiv.org/abs/1303.0142
&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;
S.A. Goorden, M. Horstmann, A.P. Mosk, B. &amp;#352;kori&amp;#263;, P.W.H. Pinkse,
"Quantum-secure authentication of a physical unclonable key",
http://www.opticsinfobase.org/optica/abstract.cfm?uri=optica-1-6-421
&lt;/ref&gt;
This realization is known under the name Quantum-Secure Authentication.

=== Security proofs ===
Security has been proven in the case of Challenge Estimation attacks,
in which the attacker tries to determine the challenge as best as he can using measurements.
There are proofs for n=1,&lt;ref&gt;
B. &amp;#352;kori&amp;#263;, "Quantum Readout of Physical Unclonable Functions", 
http://eprint.iacr.org/2009/369
&lt;/ref&gt;
for quadrature measurements on coherent states
&lt;ref&gt;
B. &amp;#352;kori&amp;#263;, A.P. Mosk, P.W.H. Pinkse, 
"Security of Quantum-Readout PUFs against quadrature based challenge estimation attacks",
http://eprint.iacr.org/2013/084
&lt;/ref&gt;
and for fixed number of quanta n&gt;1.
&lt;ref&gt;
B. &amp;#352;kori&amp;#263;, 
"Security analysis of Quantum-Readout PUFs in the case of challenge-estimation attacks",
http://eprint.iacr.org/2013/479
&lt;/ref&gt;
The result for dimension K and n quanta
is that the false acceptance probability in a single round
cannot exceed (n+1)/(n+K).

The security of the continuous-variable quantum authentication of PUFs against an emulation attack, has been also addressed in the framework of Holevo’s bound and Fano’s inequality&lt;ref&gt;Georgios M. Nikolopoulos, [https://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.97.012324 "Continuous-variable quantum authentication of physical unclonable keys: Security against an emulation attack"], ''Physical Review A'', 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;.

In [[game theory]], '''rationalizability''' is a [[solution concept]].  The general idea is to provide the weakest constraints on players while still requiring that players are [[rational]] and this rationality is [[common knowledge]] among the players. It is more permissive than [[Nash equilibrium]]. Both require that players respond optimally to some belief about their opponents' actions, but Nash equilibrium requires that these beliefs be correct while rationalizability does not.  Rationalizability was first defined, independently, by Bernheim (1984) and Pearce (1984).  

== Definition ==

Given a [[normal-form game]], the rationalizable set of actions can be computed as follows: Start with the full action set for each player. Next, remove all actions which are never a best reply to any belief about the opponents' actions -- the motivation for this step is that no rational player could choose such actions. Next, remove all actions which are never a best reply to any belief about the opponents' '''remaining''' actions -- this second step is justified because each player '''knows''' that the other players are rational. Continue the process until no further actions are eliminated. In a game with finitely many actions, this process always terminates and leaves a non-empty set of actions for each player. These are the rationalizable actions.

== Constraints on beliefs ==

|-
! ''a''
| 1, 1
| 0, 0
|-
! ''b''
| 0, 0
| 1, 1
|}

Consider a simple [[coordination game]] (the [[payoff matrix]] is to the right).  The row player can play ''a'' if she can reasonably believe that the column player could play ''A'', since ''a'' is a [[best response]] to ''A''.  She can reasonably believe that the column player can play ''A'' if it is reasonable for the column player to believe that the row player could play ''a''.  He can believe that she will play ''a'' if it is reasonable for him to believe that she could play ''a'', etc.

{| border="1" align=left cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" style="margin: 1em 1em 1em 1em; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;"

! ''D''
|-
! ''c''
| 2, 2
| 0, 3
|-
! ''d''
| 3, 0
| 1, 1
|}
This provides an infinite chain of consistent beliefs that result in the players playing (''a'', ''A'').  This makes (''a'', ''A'') a rationalizable pair of actions.  A similar process can be repeated for (''b'', ''B'').  

As an example where not all strategies are rationalizable, consider a [[prisoner's dilemma]] pictured to the left.  Row player would never play ''c'', since ''c'' is not a best response to any strategy by the column player.  For this reason, ''c'' is not rationalizable.   

{| border="1" align=right cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" style="margin: 1em 1em 1em 1em; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;"

! ''R''
|-
! ''t''
| 3, -
| 0, -
|-
! ''m''
| 0, -
| 3, -
|-
! ''b''
| 1, -
| 1, -
|}

Conversely, for two-player games, the set of all rationalizable strategies can be found by iterated elimination of strictly dominated strategies. For this method to hold however, one also needs to consider strict domination by [[Strategy (game theory)|mixed strategies]]. Consider the game on the right with payoffs of the column player omitted for simplicity. Notice that "b" is not strictly dominated by either "t" or "m" in the pure strategy sense, but it is still dominated by a strategy that would mix "t" and "m" with probability of each equal to 1/2. This is due to the fact that given any belief about the action of the column player, the mixed strategy will always yield higher expected payoff.&lt;ref name="Gibbons" /&gt; This implies that "b" is not rationalizable.

Moreover, "b" is not a [[best response]] to either "L" or "R" or any mix of the two. This is because an action that is not rationalizable can never be a best response to any opponent's strategy (pure or mixed). This would imply another version of the previous method of finding rationalizable strategies as those that survive the iterated elimination of strategies that are never a best response (in pure or mixed sense).

In games with more than two players, however, there may be strategies that are not strictly dominated, but which can never be the best response.  By the iterated elimination of all such strategies one can find the rationalizable strategies for a multiplayer game.

== Rationalizability and Nash equilibria ==

It can be easily proved that every Nash equilibrium is a rationalizable equilibrium; however, the inverse is not true.  Some rationalizable equilibria are not Nash equilibria.  This makes the rationalizability concept a generalization of Nash equilibrium concept.  

{| border="1" align=right cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" style="margin: 1em 1em 1em 1em; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;"

! ''H''
! ''T''
|-
! ''h''
| 1, -1
| -1, 1
|-
! ''t''
| -1, 1
| 1, -1
|}

As an example, consider the game [[matching pennies]] pictured to the right.  In this game the only Nash equilibrium is row playing ''h'' and ''t'' with equal probability and column playing ''H'' and ''T'' with equal probability.  However, all the [[pure strategy|pure strategies]] in this game are rationalizable.

Consider the following reasoning: row can play ''h'' if it is reasonable for her to believe that column will play ''H''.  Column can play ''H'' if its reasonable for him to believe that row will play ''t''.  Row can play ''t'' if it is reasonable for her to believe that column will play ''T''.  Column can play ''T'' if it is reasonable for him to believe that row will play ''h'' (beginning the cycle again).  This provides an infinite set of consistent beliefs that results in row playing ''h''.  A similar argument can be given for row playing ''t'', and for column playing either ''H'' or ''T''.

In [[mathematics]] and its applications, the '''signed distance function''' (or '''oriented distance function''') of a set ''Ω'' in a [[metric space]] determines the distance of a given point ''x'' from the [[boundary (topology)|boundary]] of ''Ω'', with the sign determined by whether ''x'' is in ''Ω''. The function has positive values at points ''x'' inside ''Ω'', it decreases in value as ''x'' approaches the boundary of ''Ω'' where the signed distance function is zero, and it takes negative values outside of ''Ω''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=1467575 | title=Level set based shape prior segmentation | author1=Chan, T. | author2=Zhu, W. | year=2005 | conference=IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the alternative convention is also sometimes taken instead (i.e., negative inside ''Ω'' and positive outside).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=368173 | title=Shape modeling with front propagation: a level set approach | author1=Malladi, R. | author2=Sethian, J.A. | author3=Vemuri, B.C. | journal=IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence | volume=17 | issue=2 | year=1995 | doi = 10.1109/34.368173 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==

If ''Ω'' is a subset of a [[metric space]], ''X'', with metric, ''d'', then the ''signed distance function'', ''f'', is defined by
:&lt;math&gt;f(x) = \begin{cases}
   d(x, \partial \Omega) &amp; \mbox{ if } x\in\Omega \\
  -d(x, \partial \Omega)&amp;  \mbox{ if } x\in\Omega^c
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\partial \Omega&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[boundary (topology)|boundary]] of &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;. For any &lt;math&gt;x \in X&lt;/math&gt;,

: &lt;math&gt; d(x, \partial \Omega) := \inf_{y \in \partial \Omega}d(x, y)&lt;/math&gt;

where ''inf'' denotes the [[infimum]].

==Properties in Euclidean space==

If ''Ω'' is a subset of the [[Euclidean space]] '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; with [[piecewise]] [[smooth function|smooth]] boundary, then the signed distance function is differentiable [[almost everywhere]], and its [[gradient]] satisfies the [[eikonal equation]]

: &lt;math&gt;|\nabla f|=1.&lt;/math&gt;

If the boundary of ''Ω'' is ''C''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; for ''k''≥2 (see [[differentiability classes]]) then ''d'' is ''C''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; on points sufficiently close to the boundary of ''Ω''.{{sfn|Gilbarg|1983|loc=Lemma 14.16}} In particular, '''''on''''' the boundary ''f'' satisfies

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla f(x) = N(x),&lt;/math&gt;

where ''N'' is the inward normal vector field. The signed distance function is thus a differentiable extension of the normal vector field. In particular, the [[Hessian matrix|Hessian]] of the signed distance function on the boundary of ''Ω'' gives the [[Weingarten map]].

If, further, ''Γ'' is a region sufficiently close to the boundary of ''Ω'' that ''f'' is twice continuously differentiable on it, then there is an explicit formula involving the Weingarten map ''W''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; for the Jacobian of changing variables in terms of the signed distance function and nearest boundary point. Specifically, if ''T''(∂''Ω'',''μ'') is the set of points within distance ''μ'' of the boundary of ''Ω'' (i.e. the [[tubular neighbourhood]] of radius ''μ''), and ''g'' is an absolutely integrable function on ''Γ'', then

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{T(\partial\Omega,\mu)} g(x)\,dx = \int_{\partial\Omega}\int_{-\mu}^\mu g(u+\lambda N(u))\, \det(I-\lambda W_u) \,d\lambda \,dS_u,&lt;/math&gt;

where det indicates the [[determinant]] and ''dS''&lt;sub&gt;''u''&lt;/sub&gt; indicates that we are taking the [[surface integral]].{{sfn|Gilbarg|1983|loc=Equation (14.98)}}

==Algorithms==
[[Algorithm]]s for calculating the signed distance function include the efficient [[fast marching method]], [[fast sweeping method]]&lt;ref&gt;[ZHAO, Hongkai. A fast sweeping method for eikonal equations. Mathematics of Computation, 2005, 74. Jg., Nr. 250, S. 603-627.&lt;/ref&gt;  and the more general [[level-set method]].

== Applications ==
Signed distance functions are applied, for example, in [[computer vision]].

They have also recently been used in a method (advanced by [[Valve Corporation]]) to render [[smooth font]]s at large sizes (or alternatively at [[Pixel density#Named pixel densities|high DPI]]) using [[GPU]] acceleration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1145/1281500.1281665 | title=Improved alpha-tested magnification for vector textures and special effects | journal=ACM SIGGRAPH 2007 courses on - SIGGRAPH '07 | pages=9 | date=2007 | first=Chris | last=Green| isbn=9781450318235 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Valve's method computed signed [[distance field]]s in [[Raster graphics|raster space]] in order to avoid the computational complexity of solving the problem in the (continuous) vector space. More recently piece-wise approximation solutions have been proposed (which for example approximate a Bézier with arc splines), but even this way the computation can be too slow for [[real-time rendering]], and it has to be assisted by grid-based [[discretization]] techniques to approximate (and cull from the computation) the distance to points that are too far away.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tHv6mcIIeo&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:LewinTransformationNetwork.png|thumb|300px|Figure 7.9 from Lewin's ''GMIT'']] --&gt;
'''Transformational theory''' is a branch of [[music theory]] [[David Lewin]] developed in the 1980s, and formally introduced in his 1987 work, ''Generalized Musical Intervals and Transformations''.  The theory—which models [[Transformation (music)|musical transformations]] as elements of a [[Group theory|mathematical group]]—can be used to analyze both [[tonality|tonal]] and [[atonal music]].

The goal of transformational theory is to change the focus from [[musical object]]s—such as the "C [[major chord]]" or "G major chord"—to relations between objects.  Thus, instead of saying that a C major chord is followed by G major, a transformational theorist might say that the first chord has been "transformed" into the second by the "[[dominant (music)|Dominant]] operation."  (Symbolically, one might write "Dominant(C major) = G major.")  While traditional [[set theory (music)|musical set theory]] focuses on the makeup of musical objects, transformational theory focuses on the [[interval (music)|intervals]] or types of musical motion that can occur.  According to Lewin's description of this change in emphasis, "[The transformational] attitude does not ask for some observed measure of extension between reified 'points'; rather it asks: 'If I am ''at'' s and wish to get to t, what characteristic ''gesture'' should I perform in order to arrive there?'" (from "Generalized Musical Intervals and Transformations", hereafter GMIT, p.&amp;nbsp;159)

==Formalism==

The formal setting for Lewin's theory is a set S (or "space") of musical objects, and a set T of transformations on that space.  Transformations are modeled as functions acting on the entire space, meaning that every transformation must be applicable to every object.

Lewin points out that this requirement significantly constrains the spaces and transformations that can be considered.  For example, if the space S is the space of diatonic triads (represented by the Roman numerals I, ii, iii, IV, V, vi, and vii°), the "Dominant transformation" must be defined so as to apply to each of these triads.  This means, for example, that some diatonic triad must be selected as the "dominant" of the diminished triad on vii.  Ordinary musical discourse, however, typically holds that the "dominant" relationship is only between the I and V chords.  (Certainly, no diatonic triad is ordinarily considered the dominant of the diminished triad.)  In other words, "dominant," as used informally, is not a function that applies to all chords, but rather describes a particular relationship between two of them.

There are, however, any number of situations in which "transformations" can extend to an entire space.  Here, transformational theory provides a degree of abstraction that could be a significant music-theoretical asset.  One transformational network can describe the relationships among musical events in more than one musical excerpt, thus offering an elegant way of relating them.  For example, figure 7.9 in Lewin's GMIT can describe the first phrases of both the first and third movements of [[Symphony No. 1 (Beethoven)|Beethoven's Symphony No. 1 in C Major, Op. 21]].  In this case, the transformation graph's objects are the same in both excerpts from the Beethoven Symphony, but this graph could apply to many more musical examples when the object labels are removed.  Further, such a transformational network that gives only the intervals between pitch classes in an excerpt may also describe the differences in the relative durations of another excerpt in a piece, thus succinctly relating two different domains of music analysis.  Lewin's observation that only the transformations, and not the objects on which they act, are necessary to specify a transformational network is the main benefit of transformational analysis over traditional object-oriented analysis.

==Transformations as functions==

The "transformations" of transformational theory are typically modeled as functions that act over some musical space S, meaning that they are entirely defined by their inputs and outputs: for instance, the "ascending major third" might be modeled as a function that takes a particular pitch class as input and outputs the pitch class a major third above it.

However, several theorists have pointed out that ordinary musical discourse often includes more information than functions.&lt;ref name=CQT&gt;Clifton Callender, Ian Quinn, and Dmitri Tymoczko. "Generalized Voice Leading Spaces," Science 320: 346-348.&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, a single pair of pitch classes (such as C and E) can stand in multiple relationships: E is both a major third above C and a minor sixth below it.  (This is analogous to the fact that, on an ordinary clockface, the number 4 is both four steps clockwise from 12 and 8 steps counterclockwise from it.)  For this reason, theorists such as [[Dmitri Tymoczko]] have proposed replacing Lewinnian "pitch class intervals" with "paths in pitch class space."&lt;ref name="Tymoczko VL"&gt;Tymoczko, Dmitri, "Scale Theory, Serial Theory, and Voice Leading," Music Analysis 27/1 (2008), 1-49.&lt;/ref&gt;  More generally, this suggests that there are situations where it might not be useful to model musical motion ("transformations" in the intuitive sense) using functions ("transformations" in the strict sense of Lewinnian theory).

Another issue concerns the role of "distance" in transformational theory.  In the opening pages of GMIT, Lewin suggests that a subspecies of "transformations" (namely, musical intervals) can be used to model "directed measurements, distances, or motions ".  However, the mathematical formalism he uses—which models "transformations" by group elements—does not obviously represent distances, since group elements are not typically considered to have size.  (Groups are typically individuated only up to isomorphism, and isomorphism does not necessarily preserve the "sizes" assigned to group elements.)  Theorists such as Ed Gollin, Dmitri Tymoczko, and Rachel Hall, have all written about this subject, with Gollin attempting to incorporate "distances" into a broadly Lewinnian framework.

Tymoczko's "Generalizing Musical Intervals"&lt;ref name="Tymoczko GMI"&gt;Tymoczko, Dmitri, "Generalizing Musical Intervals," Journal of Music Theory 53/2 (2009): 227–254.&lt;/ref&gt; contains one of the few extended critiques of transformational theory, arguing (1) that intervals are sometimes "local" objects that, like vectors, cannot be transported around a musical space; (2) that musical spaces often have boundaries, or multiple paths between the same points, both prohibited by Lewin's formalism; and (3) that transformational theory implicitly relies on notions of distance extraneous to the formalism as such.

==Reception==

Although transformation theory is more than thirty years old, it did not become a widespread theoretical or analytical pursuit until the late 1990s.  Following Lewin's revival (in GMIT) of [[Hugo Riemann]]'s three contextual inversion operations on triads ([[Parallel key|parallel]], [[Relative key|relative]], and Leittonwechsel) as formal transformations, the branch of transformation theory called [[Neo-Riemannian theory]] was popularized by Brian Hyer (1995), Michael Kevin Mooney (1996), [[Richard Cohn]] (1997), and an entire issue of the ''[[Journal of Music Theory]]'' (42/2, 1998).  Transformation theory has received further treatment by [[Fred Lerdahl]] (2001), [[Julian Hook]] (2002), David Kopp (2002), and many others.

The status of transformational theory is currently a topic of debate in music-theoretical circles.  Some authors, such as Ed Gollin, [[Dmitri Tymoczko]] and Julian Hook, have argued that Lewin's transformational formalism is too restrictive, and have called for extending the system in various ways.  Others, such as [[Richard Cohn]] and Steven Rings, while acknowledging the validity of some of these criticisms, continue to use broadly Lewinnian techniques.

==Research==
[[File:Chvátal graph.svg|thumb|The [[Chvátal graph]]]]
Chvátal first learned of graph theory in 1964, on finding a book by [[Claude Berge]] in a [[Plzeň|Pilsen]] bookstore &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

}},&lt;/ref&gt; and much of his research involves graph theory:

}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Another graph-theoretic result of Chvátal was the 1970 construction of the smallest possible [[triangle-free graph]] that is both 4-[[chromatic number|chromatic]] and 4-[[regular graph|regular]], now known as the [[Chvátal graph]].&lt;ref name="abcr"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{MathWorld | title = Chvátal Graph | urlname = ChvatalGraph}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}},&lt;/ref&gt; relating Hamiltonian cycles to connectivity and [[maximum independent set]] size of a graph, earned Chvátal his [[Erdős number]] of 1. Specifically, if there exists an ''s'' such that a given graph is ''s''-[[k-vertex-connected graph|vertex-connected]] and has no (''s''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)-vertex independent set, the graph must be Hamiltonian. Avis et al.&lt;ref name="abcr"/&gt; tell the story of Chvátal and [[Paul Erdős|Erdős]] working out this result over the course of a long road trip, and later thanking Louise Guy "for her steady driving."
*In a 1973 paper,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

}},&lt;/ref&gt;  Chvátal introduced the concept of [[graph toughness]], a measure of [[graph connectivity]] that is closely connected to the existence of [[Hamiltonian cycle]]s. A graph is ''t''-tough if, for every ''k'' greater than 1, the removal of fewer than ''tk'' vertices leaves fewer than ''k'' connected components in the remaining subgraph. For instance, in a graph with a Hamiltonian cycle, the removal of any nonempty set of vertices partitions the cycle into at most as many pieces as the number of removed vertices, so Hamiltonian graphs are 1-tough. Chvátal conjectured that 3/2-tough graphs, and later that 2-tough graphs, are always Hamiltonian; despite later researchers finding counterexamples to these conjectures, it still remains open whether some constant bound on the graph toughness is enough to guarantee Hamiltonicity.&lt;ref name="lesniak"&gt;{{Citation

Some of Chvátal's work concerns families of sets, or equivalently [[hypergraph]]s, a subject already occurring in his Ph.D. thesis, where he also studied [[Ramsey theory]].

}}&lt;/ref&gt; he suggested that, in any family of sets closed under the operation of taking [[subset]]s, the largest pairwise-intersecting subfamily may always be found by choosing an element of one of the sets and keeping all sets containing that element.
*In 1979,&lt;ref&gt;"A greedy heuristic for the set-covering problem", Mathematics of Operations Research, 1979&lt;/ref&gt; he studied a weighted version of the [[set cover problem]], and proved that a [[greedy algorithm]] provides good [[approximation algorithm|approximations]] to the optimal solution, generalizing previous unweighted results by [[David S. Johnson]] (J. Comp. Sys. Sci. 1974) and [[László Lovász]] (Discrete Math. 1975).

Chvátal first became interested in [[linear programming]] through the influence of [[Jack Edmonds]] while Chvátal was a student at Waterloo.&lt;ref name="abcr"/&gt; He quickly recognized the importance of [[cutting-plane method|cutting planes]] for attacking combinatorial optimization problems such as computing [[maximum independent set]]s and, in particular, introduced the notion of a cutting-plane proof.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2631">In mathematics, '''Ward's conjecture''' is the conjecture made by {{harvs|txt|last=Ward|authorlink=Richard S. Ward|year=1985|loc=p. 451}} that "many (and perhaps all?) of the [[ordinary differential equation|ordinary]] and [[partial differential equation]]s that are regarded as being integrable or solvable may be obtained from the self-dual [[gauge field equation]]s (or its generalizations) by reduction".

==Examples==

{{harvs||last1=Ablowitz|last2=Chakravarty|last3=Halburd|year=2003|txt}} explain how a variety of completely integrable equations such as the [[Korteweg-de Vries equation]] or KdV equation, the [[Kadomtsev–Petviashvili equation]] or KP equation, the [[nonlinear Schrödinger equation]], the [[sine-Gordon equation]], the [[Ernst equation]] and the [[Painlevé transcendents|Painlevé equations]] all arise as reductions or other simplifications of the [[self-dual Yang-Mills equation]]

They also obtain the equations of an integrable system known as the Euler–Arnold–Manakov top, a generalization of the [[Lagrange, Euler and Kovalevskaya tops#Euler Top|Euler top]], and they state that the [[Lagrange, Euler and Kovalevskaya tops#Kovalevskaya Top|Kowalevsaya top]] is also a reduction of the self-dual Yang-Mills equations.

Via the [[Penrose-Ward transform]] these solutions give the [[holomorphic vector bundle]]s often seen in the context of algebraic [[integrable systems]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19397">The '''X-machine''' (''XM'') is a theoretical model of [[computation]] introduced by [[Samuel Eilenberg]] in 1974.&lt;ref
  name="Eil74"&gt;S. Eilenberg (1974)
  ''Automata, Languages and Machines, Vol. A''. 
  Academic Press, London.&lt;/ref&gt;
The ''X'' in "X-machine" represents the fundamental data type on which the machine operates; for example, a machine that operates on databases (objects of type ''database'') would be a ''database''-machine. The X-machine model is structurally the same as the [[finite state machine]], except that the symbols used to label the machine's transitions denote [[Relation (mathematics)|relations]] of type ''X''→''X''. Crossing a transition is equivalent to applying the relation that labels it (computing a set of changes to the data type ''X''), and traversing a path in the machine corresponds to applying all the associated relations, one after the other.

==Original theory ==

Eilenberg's original X-machine was a completely general theoretical model of computation (subsuming the [[Turing machine]], for example), which admitted deterministic, non-deterministic and non-terminating computations.  His seminal work &lt;ref name="Eil74" /&gt; published many variants of the basic X-machine model, each of which generalized the [[finite state machine]] in a slightly different way.

In the most general model, an X-machine is essentially a "machine for manipulating objects of type X". Suppose that X is some [[datatype]], called the ''fundamental datatype'', and that Φ is a set of (partial) relations φ: X → X. An X-machine is a [[finite state machine]] whose arrows are labelled by relations in Φ. In any given state, one or more transitions may be ''enabled'' if the [[Domain (mathematics)|domain]] of the associated relation φ&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; accepts (a subset of) the current values stored in X.  In each cycle, all enabled transitions are assumed to be taken.  Each recognised path through the machine generates a list φ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ... φ&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; of relations. We call the composition φ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;small&gt;o&lt;/small&gt; ... &lt;small&gt;o&lt;/small&gt; φ&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; of these relations the ''path relation'' corresponding to that path. The ''behaviour'' of the X-machine is defined to be the union of all the behaviours computed by its path relations. In general, this is non-deterministic, since applying any relation computes a set of outcomes on X. In the formal model, all possible outcomes are considered together, in parallel.

For practical purposes, an X-machine should describe some finite computation.  An encoding function α: Y → X converts from some ''input'' data type Y into the initial state of X, and a decoding function β: X → Z, converts back from the final state(s) of X into some ''output'' data type Z.  Once the initial state of X is populated, the X-machine runs to completion, and the outputs are then observed.  In general, a machine may deadlock (be blocked), or livelock (never halt), or perform one or more complete computations.  For this reason, more recent research has focused on deterministic X-machines, whose behaviour can be controlled and observed more precisely.

=== Example ===

A compiler with a peep-hole optimizer can be thought of as a machine for optimizing program structure.  In this '''Optimizer'''-machine, the encoding function α takes source code from the input-type Y (the program source) and loads it into the memory-type X (a parse tree).  Suppose that the machine has several states, called '''FindIncrements''', '''FindSubExprs''' and '''Completed'''.  The machine starts in the initial state '''FindIncrements''', which is linked to other states via the transitions:

  '''FindIncrements''' →&lt;sup&gt;'''DoIncrement'''&lt;/sup&gt; '''FindIncrements'''
  '''FindIncrements''' →&lt;sup&gt;'''SkipIncrement'''&lt;/sup&gt; '''FindSubExprs'''
  '''FindSubExprs''' →&lt;sup&gt;'''DoSubExpr'''&lt;/sup&gt; '''FindSubExprs'''
  '''FindSubExprs''' →&lt;sup&gt;'''SkipSubExpr'''&lt;/sup&gt; '''Completed'''

The relation '''DoIncrement''' maps a parsed subtree corresponding to "x := x + 1" into the optimized subtree "++x".  The relation '''DoSubExpr''' maps a parse tree containing multiple occurrences of the same expression "x + y ... x + y" into an optimized version with a local variable to store the repeated computation "z := x + y; ... z ... z".  These relations are only enabled if X contains the domain values (subtrees) on which they operate.  The remaining relations '''SkipIncrement''' and '''SkipSubExpr''' are ''nullops'' (identity relations) enabled in the complementary cases.

So, the '''Optimizer'''-machine will run to completion, first converting trivial additions into in-place increments (while in the '''FindIncrements''' state), then it will move on to the '''FindSubExprs''' state and perform a series of common sub-expression removals, after which it will move to the final state '''Completed'''.  The decoding function β will then map from the memory-type X (the optimized parse-tree) into the output-type Z (optimized machine code).

=== Convention ===

When referring to Eilenberg's original model, "X-machine" is typically written with a lower-case "m", because the sense is "any machine for processing X".  When referring to later specific models, the convention is to use a capital "M" as part of the proper name of that variant.

==1980s==
Interest in the X-machine was revived in the late 1980s by Mike Holcombe,&lt;ref
  name="Hol88a"&gt;M. Holcombe (1988)
  'X-machines as a basis for dynamic system specification',
  ''Software Engineering Journal'' '''3'''(2), pp. 69-76.&lt;/ref&gt; who noticed that the model was ideal for software [[formal specification]] purposes, because it cleanly separates ''control flow'' from ''processing''. Provided one works at a sufficiently abstract level, the control flows in a computation can usually be represented as a finite state machine, so to complete the X-machine specification all that remains is to specify the processing associated with each of the machine's transitions. The structural simplicity of the model makes it extremely flexible; other early illustrations of the idea included Holcombe's specification of human-computer interfaces,&lt;ref
  name="Hol88b"&gt;M. Holcombe (1988)
  'Formal methods in the specification of the human-machine interface', 
  ''International J. Command and Control, Communications and Info. Systems.'' '''2''', pp. 24-34.&lt;/ref&gt;

==1990s==
X-machines have received renewed attention since the mid-1990s, when Gilbert Laycock's deterministic [[Stream X-Machine]]&lt;ref name="Lay"&gt;Gilbert Laycock (1993) ''The Theory and Practice of Specification Based Software Testing''. PhD Thesis, University of Sheffield.

== Major variants ==

The X-machine is rarely encountered in its original form, but underpins several subsequent models of computation.  The most influential model on theories of software testing has been the [[Stream X-Machine]].  [[NASA]] has recently discussed using a combination of [[Communicating X-Machine|Communicating Stream X-Machines]] and the process calculus WSCSS in the design and testing of ''swarm satellite'' systems.&lt;ref name="HRRT05" /&gt;

=== Analog X Machine (AXM) ===

The earliest variant, the continuous-time ''Analog X-Machine'' (''AXM''), was introduced by Mike Stannett in 1990 as a potentially "super-Turing" model of computation;&lt;ref
  name="Sta90"&gt;M. Stannett (1990) 
  'X-machines and the Halting Problem: Building a super-Turing machine'. 
  ''Formal Aspects of Computing'' '''2''', pp. 331-41.&lt;/ref&gt;
it is consequently related to work in [[hypercomputation]] theory.&lt;ref
  name="Cop02"&gt;B. J. Copeland (2002) 
  'Hypercomputation'. 
  ''Minds and Machines'' '''12''', pp. 461-502.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Stream X-Machine (SXM) ===
{{main|Stream X-Machine}}
The most commonly encountered X-machine variant is Gilbert Laycock's 1993 ''[[Stream X-Machine]]'' (''[[SXM (computational model)|SXM]]'') model,&lt;ref name="Lay" /&gt;
which forms the basis for Mike Holcombe and Florentin Ipate's theory of ''complete'' software testing, which guarantees known correctness properties, once testing is over.&lt;ref name="HI98" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IH98"&gt;F. Ipate and M. Holcombe (1998) 'A method for refining and testing generalised machine specifications'.
  ''Int. J. Comp. Math.'' '''68''', pp. 197-219.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Stream X-Machine differs from Eilenberg's original model, in that the fundamental data type X is of the form ''Out''* × ''Mem'' × ''In''*, where ''In''* is an input sequence, ''Out''* is an output sequence, and ''Mem'' is the (rest of the) memory.

The advantage of this model is that it allows a system to be driven, one step at a time, through its states and transitions, while observing the outputs at each step.  These are witness values, that guarantee that particular functions were executed on each step.  As a result, complex software systems may be decomposed into a hierarchy of Stream X-Machines, designed in a top-down way and tested in a bottom-up way.  This divide-and-conquer approach to design and testing is backed by Florentin Ipate's proof of correct integration,&lt;ref name="IpaHol97"&gt;F. Ipate and M. Holcombe (1997) 'An integration testing method that is proved to find all faults', ''International Journal of Computer Mathematics'' '''63''', pp. 159-178.&lt;/ref&gt; which proves how testing the layered machines independently is equivalent to testing the composed system.

=== Communicating X-Machine (CXM) ===
{{Redirect|CXM|the Angolan airport with that [[IATA]] code|Camaxilo Airport}}

The earliest proposal for connecting several X-machines in parallel is Judith Barnard's 1995 ''Communicating X-machine'' (''CXM'' or ''COMX'') model,&lt;ref
  name="BTWM95"&gt;J. Barnard, C. Theaker, J. Whitworth and M. Woodward (1995) 'Real-time communicating X-machines for the formal design of real-time systems', in ''Proceedings of DARTS '95, Universite Libre, Brussels, Belgium, 9–11 November 2005''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref
  name="Bar96"&gt;J. Barnard (1996)
  ''COMX: A methodology for the formal design of computer systems using Communicating X-machines''. 
  PhD Thesis, Staffordshire University.&lt;/ref&gt;
in which machines are connected via named communication channels (known as ''ports''); this model exists in both discrete- and real-timed variants.&lt;ref
  name="AldBarn97"&gt;A. Alderson and J. Barnard (1997)
  'On Making a Crossing Safe',
  ''Technical Report SOCTR/97/01'', School of Computing, Staffordshire University.
  [http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/alderson97making.html (Citeseer)]
&lt;/ref&gt;  Earlier versions of this work were not fully formal and did not show full input/output relations.

A similar Communicating X-Machine approach using buffered
channels was developed by Petros Kefalas.&lt;ref name="KEK00a"&gt;E. Kehris, G. Eleftherakis and P. Kefalas (2000) 'Using X-machines to model and test discrete event simulation programs', ''Proc. 4th World Multiconference on Circuits, Systems, Communications and Computers'', Athens.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="KEK00b"&gt;P. Kefalas, G. Eleftherakis and E. Kehris (2000) 'Communicating X-machines: a practical approach for modular specification of large systems', ''Technical Report CS-09/00, Department of Computer Science'', City College, Thessaloniki.&lt;/ref&gt;  The focus of this work was on expressiveness in the composition of components.  The ability to reassign channels meant that some of the testing theorems from Stream X-Machines did not carry over.

These variants are discussed [[Communicating X-Machine|in more detail]] on a separate page.

=== Communicating Stream X-Machine (CSXM) ===

The first fully formal model of concurrent X-machine composition was proposed in 1999 by Cristina Vertan and Horia Georgescu,&lt;ref name="GeoVer00"&gt;H. Georgescu and C.

  [http://www.dcs.shef.ac.uk/~ajc/csxms/papers/euromic94.html Abstract]&lt;/ref&gt;  In Vertan's model, the machines communicate indirectly, via a shared ''communication matrix'' (essentially an array of pigeonholes), rather than directly via shared channels.

Bălănescu, Cowling, Georgescu, Vertan and others have studied the formal properties of this CSXM model in some detail.  Full input/output relations can be shown.  The ''communication matrix'' establishes a protocol for synchronous communication.  The advantage of this is that it decouples each machine's processing from their communication, allowing the separate testing of each behaviour.  This compositional model was proven equivalent to a standard [[Stream X-Machine]],&lt;ref name="BCHGGV99"&gt;T.Balanescu, A. J. Cowling, H. Georgescu, M. Gheorghe, M. Holcombe and C. Vertan (1999) 'Communicating X-machines systems are no more than X-machines', ''Journal of Universal Computer Science'', '''5''' ''(9)'', pp. 494-507.&lt;/ref&gt; so leveraging the earlier testing theory developed by Holcombe and Ipate.

This X-machine variant is discussed [[Communicating X-Machine|in more detail]] on a separate page.

=== Object X-Machine (OXM) ===

Kirill Bogdanov and Anthony Simons developed several variants of the X-machine to model the behaviour of objects in object-oriented systems.&lt;ref name="SBH01"&gt;A. J. H. Simons, K. E. Bogdanov and W. M. L. Holcombe (2001) 'Complete functional testing using object machines', ''Technical Report CS-01-18, Department of Computer Science'', University of Sheffield&lt;/ref&gt;  This model differs from the [[Stream X-Machine]] approach, in that the monolithic data type X is distributed over, and encapsulated by, several objects, which are serially composed; and systems are driven by method invocations and returns, rather than by inputs and outputs.  
Further work in this area concerned adapting the formal testing theory in the context of inheritance, which partitions the state-space of the superclass in extended subclass objects.&lt;ref name="Simo06"&gt;A. J. H. Simons (2006) 'A theory of regression testing for behaviourally compatible object types', ''Software Testing, Verification and Reliability'', '''16''' ''(3)'', John Wiley, pp. 133-156.&lt;/ref&gt;

A "CCS-augmented X-machine" (CCSXM) model was later developed by Simons and Stannett in 2002 to support complete behavioural testing of object-oriented systems, in the presence of asynchronous communication&lt;ref

  'CCS-Augmented X-Machines', 
  ''Technical Report CS-2002-04, Department of Computer Science'', Sheffield University, UK.&lt;/ref&gt;  This is expected to bear some similarity with [[NASA]]'s recent proposal; but no definitive comparison of the two models has as yet been conducted.
