[[File:Alfred bruyas.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Portrait of Alfred Bruyas, [[Gustave Courbet]], 1854]]
'''Alfred Bruyas''' (15 August 1821 – 1 January 1876) was an art collector and a personal friend of many important artists of his time, among them [[Gustave Courbet]]. He donated his collection to the [[Musée Fabre]], in [[Montpellier]].

Born Jacques Louis Bruyas, he was the son of a wealthy banker in Montpellier. His interest in art was clear even at school.  In 1840 he studied at the studio of [[Charles Matet]], however he soon recognized the limits of his own talents and shifted his focus to the promotion and collection of contemporary art.

From 1849 to 1854 he spent most of his time in Paris. There he collected work by [[Louis Hector Allemand]], [[Camille Corot]], [[Thomas Couture]], [[Eugène Delacroix]], [[Narcisse Diaz de Peña]], [[Adrien Guignet]], [[Adolphe Hervier]], [[Prosper Marilhat]], [[Edouard-Antoine Marsal]], [[Jean-François Millet]], [[Théodore Rousseau]], [[Philippe-Joseph Tassaert]], [[Marcel Verdier]] and [[Constant Troyon]], but above all the work of [[Gustave Courbet]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5670">'''Alliance for California Traditional Arts (ACTA)''' is a private [[nonprofit organization]] that provides advocacy, connections, [[Grant (money)|grants]], and other resources for [[Folk art|folk]] and traditional artists in [[California]] to preserve the health and longevity of California’s diverse cultural communities. Amy Kitchener, a public folklorist, is the co-founder, founding director, and current Executive Director.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.myphilanthropedia.org/top-nonprofits/bay-area/arts-culture/alliance-for-california-traditional-arts&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Founded in 1997 by artists, arts administrators, and cultural arts enthusiasts, this organization began with a budget of $15,000, which has since grown to over 1.2 million annually. In 1999, ACTA became recognized as the official partner of the [[California Arts Council]] and has the distinction of being the only state organization that focuses solely on folk and traditional arts.  ACTA [[Incorporation (business)|incorporated]] in 2001 and achieved [[501(c)(3)]] status in December 2002.

== Mission ==
ACTA's stated mission is to ensure that “California’s future holds California’s past” by promoting and supporting ways for cultural traditions to thrive. Their main goals are to provide cultural organizations, which are often under-recognized or completely unrecognized, the necessary resources, advocacy, and connections to thrive for years to come, contributing to the cultural diversity, cultural continuity, and community health of California.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.actaonline.org/content/mission Mission statement], ACTA online&lt;/ref&gt;

== Community Involvement ==
ACTA is funded through a diverse network of [[Foundation (non-profit)|foundations]], [[arts council]]s, and [[philanthropists]]. There are numerous ways for nonprofit groups to receive benefits from ACTA. Among the simplest is by listing themselves in ACTA’s statewide database, by receiving the monthly e-newsletter ACTA publishes on traditional and folk arts, and by using their website as a forum to advertise their events as well as a vehicle to learn about other national and statewide agencies committed to helping the arts. 

In a more hands-on fashion, groups in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] can benefit from the Traditional Arts Roundtable Series that ACTA curates. These meetings foster an intercultural environment where tradition bearers and arts advocates can network, exchange ideas, learn from one another, and help each other with fundraising and technical assistance in community-based arts event planning. Recent roundtable discussions have been: “Borderlands: A Conversation about Immigration and the Arts,” “Worksample Laboratory for Traditional and Tradition-Based Artists,” and “Small Business Development for Traditional Artists.”

== Grant Programs ==
The crux of the support that ACTA gives to local arts communities is through three separate programs offered every year: The Apprenticeship Program, the Living Cultures Grants Program, and the Traditional Arts Development Program. A fourth grant program, the Traditional Arts Sustainability Grant, was offered for the first time in 2010. 

:'''Apprenticeship Program:''' Designed to facilitate a one-on-one training experience where apprentices can spend six months to a year under the tutelage of a master artist who resides in California. For this period of concentrated learning, ACTA provides up to $3,000 in compensation to the master artist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.cac.ca.gov/othergrants/ogdetail.php?id=76 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-07-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928055416/http://www.cac.ca.gov/othergrants/ogdetail.php?id=76 |archive-date=2011-09-28 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:'''Living Cultures Program:''' Nonprofit organizations that are undergoing a project that can demonstrate a “significant impact on a cultural tradition,” may receive up to $7,500 toward their expenses.&lt;ref&gt;http://foundationcenter.org/pnd/rfp/rfp_item.jhtml?id=251200006&lt;/ref&gt;

:'''Traditional Arts Development Program:''' Directed at both individuals as well as organizations, this program is intended to provide short term assistance for people to attend workshops, mentoring sessions, or specialized training activities that facilitate the strategic opportunity for growth of an artist or of an organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.cac.ca.gov/othergrants/ogdetail.php?id=77 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-07-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928055420/http://www.cac.ca.gov/othergrants/ogdetail.php?id=77 |archive-date=2011-09-28 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:'''Traditional Arts Sustainability Grants:''' The Community Leadership Project chose ACTA to offer 8 grants, of up to $30,000 a year, over a three-year period, to nonprofit organizations which focus on using traditional arts in order to contribute to high-concentration minority or low-income communities in the San Joaquin Valley and the Central Coast.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.mycalconnect.org/coachella/announcementdetail.aspx?id=13240 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-07-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120327205605/http://www.mycalconnect.org/coachella/announcementdetail.aspx?id=13240 |archive-date=2012-03-27 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Battle of Orsha''''' is a painting of the [[Battle of Orsha]], which was fought on September 8, 1514 between the allied forces of the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] and the [[Jagiellon Poland|Kingdom of Poland]] (to the right hand side of the painting) against the [[Vasili III]]'s army of the [[Grand Duchy of Moscow]] (left) as part of the [[Muscovite–Lithuanian Wars]].

The painting, the only work of its kind in Polish Renaissance painting, is in the [[National Museum in Warsaw]]. The anonymous "Master of the Battle of Orsha" was probably one of the court painters-cartographers, from his technique and style probably an artist from the circle of [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]]. Meticulous details suggest the artist was himself a witness to the battle. There is a self-portrait of the artist as an unarmed figure in German costume (near bottom, right of centre), sitting on a tree stump on the bank of the [[Dnieper river]], looking at the battle, while framing his fingers to compose a view.

According to one hypothesis the author of the picture was the German artist [[Hans Krell]], court painter of [[Louis II of Hungary]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=120|title=Polish Commonwealth Treasures: On the History of Polish Collecting from the 13th Century to the Late 18th|author1=Dorota Folga-Januszewska |author2=Andrzej Rottermund |author3=Lech Majewski |publisher=Wydawca Bosz |year=2008 |isbn=8387730815}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Analysis ==
The image shows a [[bird's eye view]] of several stages of the battle; the same characters appearing in different places - Hetman [[Konstanty Ostrogski]] is shown three times. Details of equipment and weapons and portraits of the commanders have been recreated realistically and with great accuracy, showing, among others, such scenes as emptying water from armor after crossing the river. Some scenes verge on the grotesque; others emphasize the cruelty of the battle.

The image has not been preserved in its entirety. Careful analysis suggests that it was initially taller and included the horizon. Its asymmetrical composition suggests that 1/5 of the width was trimmed from the left. The two conflicting columns of heavy infantry, presumably once the center of the image, are now shifted to the left. The established date of the image is 1520-1534.

'''''Cahiers d'Art''''' is a French artistic and literary journal founded in 1926 by [[Christian Zervos]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Serafin|first=Amy|title=Archive covers from relaunched French magazine Cahiers d'Art|url=http://www.wallpaper.com/art/archive-covers-from-relaunched-french-magazine-cahiers-dart/6237|work=Wallpaper*|accessdate=23 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Cahiers d'Art'' is also an eponymous publishing house which has published many monographs on artists living in France in the first half of the twentieth century. Publications include the definitive catalogue of works by [[Pablo Picasso]], ''Pablo Picasso par Christian Zervos'', in 33 volumes, with over 16,000 images.&lt;ref name=Cahiers /&gt;

''Cahiers d'Art'' carries no advertising and is published on an irregular schedule.&lt;ref name=FT /&gt;

== History ==
The journal, founded by the art critic [[Christian Zervos]] in Paris at 14, rue du Dragon in 1926, was published with an interruption from 1941 to 1943, until 1960. The first post-war issue was dated 1940-1944 and focused on poets and writers from the [[French Resistance|Resistance]], including [[Vercors (writer)|Vercors]]. ''Cahiers d'Art'' also published selections from poet [[Paul Éluard]]'s ''Open Book I'' (1940) and ''Open Book II'' (1942).

After World War II, the psychoanalyst [[Jacques Lacan]] was invited by Zervos to publish two articles on logic: ''Logical Time and the Assertion of Anticipated Certainty'' (1945) and ''The Number Thirteen and the Logical Form of Suspicion'' (1946). [[Samuel Beckett]] also contributed one of his earliest texts in French,''The Painting of Van de Velde or the World and the Pants.''

The journal has been noted for the quality of its articles and illustrations which promoted [[Modern Art]] in France for over thirty years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=36e année, n°1, 2012 : Renaissance des " Cahiers d’art " au détour d’une rue|url=http://www.artmediaagency.com/56319/36e-annee-n1-2012-renaissance-des-cahiers-dart-au-detour-dune-rue/|work=Art Media Agency|accessdate=23 January 2013}}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Artists represented include [[Picasso]], [[Matisse]], [[Fernand Léger]], [[Max Ernst]], [[Raoul Dufy]], [[Marc Chagall]], [[Brâncuși]], [[Van Gogh]], [[Paul Klee]], [[Henry Laurens]], [[Moholy-Nagy]], [[Jean Lurçat]], [[Joan Miró]], [[Alexander Calder|Calder]], [[Victor Brauner]], [[De Chirico]], [[Wolfgang Paalen]], [[Marcel Duchamp]], and [[Man Ray]].

==Since 2012==
*The first issue featured works by [[Ellsworth Kelly]], [[Cyprien Gaillard]], [[Sarah Morris]] and [[Adrián Villar Rojas]], and the architecture of [[Oscar Niemeyer]].&lt;ref name=Cahiers&gt;{{cite journal|title=Ellsworth Kelly|journal=Cahiers d'Art|date=October 2012|volume=1|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the re-launch of ''Cahiers d'Art,'' 14 rue du Dragon has reopened as a gallery and library, while 15 rue du Dragon now operates as an exhibition space for limited edition prints and editions by contemporary artists.
*In October 2013, ''Cahiers d'Art'' presented an exhibition of [[Philippe Parreno]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saywho.fr/mondanites/3226/vernissage-cahiers-d-art-philippe-parreno/164009|title=Vernissage Cahiers d'art - Philippe Parreno|work=SAYWHO}}&lt;/ref&gt; including recent drawings of the artist as well as a dozen master drawings : [[Francisco de Goya]], [[Victor Hugo]], [[Wassily Kandinsky]], [[Ad Reinhardt]], [[Richard Case]], [[Liam Gillick]], [[Matthew Barney]], Koo Jeong-A and [[John Cage]].
*In 2014 ''Cahiers d'Art'' released the newly published edition of the [[Pablo Picasso]] by [[Christian Zervos]] catalogue, known by many simply as 'the Zervos', in French and for the first time in English. This catalogue of more than 16,000 works in 33 volumes contains updates from the Picasso Administration.
*The second issue of the revue, N°1-2, 2013 features the work of [[Rosemarie Trockel]] who created especially for ''Cahiers d'Art'' a vinyl inserted in each revue that you can squeeze to make a sculpture. She also designed a plexiglass box for the limited edition. The publication also introduces the work of Peter Fischli and David Weiss, [[Le Corbusier]], Inge Mahn, [[:de:Absalon (Künstler)|Absalon]], and Riccardo Paratore, as well as texts by [[Hans Ulrich Obrist]], Brigid Doherty, Joan Simon, [[Jean-Louis Cohen|Jean Louis Cohen]] and poems by [[Rolf Dieter Brinkmann]].

[[File:Plan of Pompeii with Casa del Menandro marked.svg|thumb|Plan of Pompeii with the Casa del Menandro highlighted in red]]
The '''Casa del Menandro''' ('''House of Menander''') is a house in [[Pompeii]], [[Italy]].  It is located in Region I, Insula 10, Entrance 4 (I.10.4). It covers an area of about {{Convert|1800|m2|ft2}}. The house was excavated between November 1926 and June 1932.&lt;ref name="STOA"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.stoa.org/projects/ph/house?id=9|title=Casa del Menandro|website=www.stoa.org|access-date=2016-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ownership of the house==

Della Corte thought the owner could be Quintus Poppaeus Sabinus due to a seal and a graffito in the entrance corridor mentioning 'Quintus' and other graffiti in the house referring to 'Sabinus'.&lt;ref name="STOA"/&gt;

The nationality of the owner is more in dispute than their economic status.  [[Pompeii]]’s Mediterranean climate enticed many [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] to invest in holiday [[villa]]s there, so it is possible that the owner at the time of [[Vesuvius]]’ eruption in 79 AD was a wealthy tourist, not a local.&lt;ref name="PlanetWare"&gt;[http://www.planetware.com/tourist-attractions-/pompeii-pompei-i-cm-pp.htm No Author Listed, House of Menander, Tourist Attractions in Pompeii, Italy 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Art, architecture, and graffiti ==

===Fresco===

[[Image:Pompeii - Casa del Menandro - Menander.jpg|left|thumb|The fresco of [[Menander]] from which the house takes its name]]

The estate is referred to as “The House of Menander” because there is a well-preserved [[fresco]] of the ancient Greek Dramatist [[Menander]] in a small room off the [[peristyle]]. Some speculate the painting is not actually of Menander but rather of the owner of the house or another person reading works by Menander.

The house included other frescoes, including one depicting the death of [[Laocoon]].

=== Classical style and Hellenism ===

The large [[columns]] in the [[peristyle]] of the Casa del Menandro are representative of the [[Doric style]] of architecture, an offshoot of the [[Classical Style]], which also stems from [[Greece]].  The emphasis on Greek culture in Pompeian architecture is not surprising since Greek sailors had been using the port as a trading post before the [[Oscans]] founded the city in the 6th century BC.&lt;ref name="ClassicalArchitecture"&gt;Roberts, Adam, Classical Architecture. London, Penguin Books. 1990&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Peristyle"&gt;Curran, Leo, Pompeii: House of Pansa: Atrium and Peristyle, 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

===Graffiti===
Numerous examples of [[Roman graffiti]] can be observed on the exterior walls of the house.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pompeiana.org/Resources/Ancient/Graffiti%20from%20Pompeii.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-02-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303184129/http://www.pompeiana.org/resources/ancient/graffiti%20from%20pompeii.htm |archivedate=2016-03-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The gold '''Casco de Leiro''' ("[[Helmet]] of Leiro") is a ritual hemispherical [[cap]] probably dating to the end of the [[Bronze Age|Late Bronze Age]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://museos.xunta.gal/es/arqueoloxico-coruna Museo Arqueolóxico e Histórico webpage]; "We believe that the most coherent archaeological context for the dating of Leiro would correspond to the final centuries of the Late Bronze Age"  ([http://webs.uvigo.es/beacomendador/index_archivos/LEIRO.pdf Beatriz Comendador Rey, "The Leiro Hoard (Galicia, Spain): the lonely find?"], ''Gold und kult der Bronzezeit'', exhibition catalogue, Germanisches Nationalmuseum, Nuremberg, 2003:176-188)&lt;/ref&gt; (''circa'' 1,000 to 800 BC) in the town of [[Leiro, Rianxo|Leiro]] (municipality of [[Rianxo]], [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], [[Spain]]). The circumstances of its discovery show that technically it constitutes a [[hoard]].&lt;ref&gt;As remarked by Almeida ''et al.'', "Galicia Different Place: da cronoloxía do ouro precastrexo e ouros tópicos", ''Historia Nova: Contribución dos Xoves Historiadores do Galicis'' '''3''' (1994:30f), noted by Comendador Rey 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

The cap, hammered from a single casting of gold,&lt;ref&gt;Armbruster 1999:243f&lt;/ref&gt; is entirely covered with registers of repeated [[repoussé]] decoration, hammered over bronze molds, of repeated bosses alternating with bands of repeated concentric circles. The central point is applied with a flat-sided point in the form of a truncated cone. Its maximum diameter is 19.5&amp;nbsp;cm with a height of 15&amp;nbsp;cm to the base of the point, it weighs 270 grams.&lt;ref&gt;[[:gl:Casco de Leiro|Gallego Wikipedia]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Its registers of hammered decoration present parallels with the decors of late Bronze Age conical [[golden hats]] of the [[Golden Hat of Schifferstadt|Schifferstadt type]] and the gold bowls found at [[Axtroki|Axtroki, Guipúzcoa]], or the so-called  [[Treasure of Villena]], Alicante. There is a possibility that its uses were twofold: as a ritual basin, though it is decoratively pierced with an [[wikt:awl|awl]], and inverted as an emblem of authority.

The casque was a chance discovery made by a fisherman, José Vicente Somoza, on 7 April 1976 at a small rocky point called [[Curruncho dos Porcos]], by the beach at [[Leiro]] (Rianxo) in [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia, Spain]]. The site, on the large estuary called the Ría de Arousa, is part of the estuary system of the [[Ulla]],  which offers "optimum conditions for navigation" and has served since time immemorial as an easy passage into the heart of Galicia.&lt;ref&gt;Comendador Rey, 2003:&lt;/ref&gt; Removing some earth to flatten a space for a shed in which to beach his boat, he struck a coarsely made&lt;ref&gt;Comendador Rey 2003, judging from the few isolated [[sherd]]s suggests "a good-size hemispherical vessel with a coarse finish".&lt;/ref&gt; earthenware crock that broke as he struck it. He immediately saw that it contained a gold object, and he reported the find to the Guardia Civil of Rianxo and the Department of Archaeology at the [[Instituto Padre Sarmiento]]. The find was transferred to the Museo Arqueolóxico e Histórico of [[A Coruña]], where it is conserved.&lt;ref&gt;[http://museos.xunta.gal/es/arqueoloxico-coruna Museo Arqueolóxico e Histórico webpage]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Elmore John Leonard Jr.''' (October 11, 1925{{snd}}August 20, 2013) was an American novelist, short story writer, and screenwriter. His earliest novels, published in the 1950s, were [[Western fiction|Westerns]], but he went on to specialize in [[crime fiction]] and [[Suspense (genre)|suspense thriller]]s, many of which have been adapted into motion pictures.

Among his best-known works are ''[[Get Shorty]]'', ''[[Out of Sight (novel)|Out of Sight]]'', ''[[Swag (novel)|Swag]]'', ''[[Hombre (novel)|Hombre]]'', ''[[Mr. Majestyk]]'', and ''[[Rum Punch]]'' (adapted as the movie ''[[Jackie Brown]]''). Leonard's writings include short stories that became the films ''[[Three-Ten to Yuma|3:10 to Yuma]]'' and ''[[The Tall T]]'', as well as the [[FX (network)|FX]] television series ''[[Justified (TV series)|Justified]]''.

==Early life and education==
Leonard was born in [[New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]], the son of Flora Amelia (née Rive) and Elmore John Leonard, Sr.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|title = Elmore Leonard Jr.|date = January 31, 2011|encyclopedia = Encyclopedia of Louisiana|accessdate = 2013-08-21|publisher = Louisiana Endowment for the Humanities|url = http://www.knowla.org/entry/518/|deadurl = no|last = Ells|first = Kevin|publication-date = August 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because his father worked as a site locator for [[General Motors]], the family moved frequently for several years. In 1934, the family settled in [[Detroit]].

&lt;!--collapse synthesis lacking references:
In the 1930s, two major events occurred that would influence many of his works.{{cn|date=August 2013}} [[Gangsters]] such as [[Bonnie and Clyde]] were making national headlines, as were the [[Detroit Tigers]] baseball team. From about 1931 until they were killed in May 1934, Bonnie and Clyde were on a rampage. The Tigers made it to the [[World Series]] in 1934, winning the Series in 1935. Leonard developed lifelong fascinations with both sports and guns.--&gt;He graduated from the [[University of Detroit Jesuit High School]] in 1943 and, after being rejected for the Marines for weak eyesight, immediately joined the Navy, where he served with the [[Seabees]] for three years in the [[Seabees in World War II#The Pacific theater|South Pacific]] (gaining the nickname "Dutch", after pitcher [[Dutch Leonard (left-handed pitcher)|Dutch Leonard]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite podcast|url = http://www.maximumfun.org/blog/2007/07/podcast-tsoya-elmore-leonard.html|accessdate = 2013-08-21|title = Podcast: TSOYA: Elmore Leonard|host = [[Jesse Thorn]]|website = [[Maximum Fun]]|date = July 3, 2007|deadurl = no}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Enrolling at the [[University of Detroit]] in 1946, he pursued writing more seriously, entering his work in short story contests and sending it off to magazines. He graduated in 1950&lt;ref name="about"/&gt; with a bachelor's degree in English and philosophy. A year before he graduated, he got a job as a [[copy writer]] with Campbell-Ewald Advertising Agency, a position he kept for several years, writing on the side.&lt;ref name="about"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.randomhouse.com/features/elmoreleonard/about/|title = Elmore Leonard &gt; About the Author|accessdate = 2013-08-21|publisher = [[Random House]]|deadurl = no}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
{{expand section|date=October 2014}}
Leonard got his first break in the fiction market during the 1950s, regularly publishing [[pulp magazine|pulp]] Western novels. Leonard had his first success in 1951 when ''[[Argosy (magazine)|Argosy]]'' published the short story "Trail of the Apaches".&lt;ref name="tap"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Get Dutch! : a biography of Elmore Leonard|last = Challen|first = Paul C.|publisher = [[ECW Press]]|isbn = 1550224220|oclc = 44674355|year = 2000|location = Toronto}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|29}} During the 1950s and early 1960s, he continued writing [[Western fiction|Westerns]], publishing more than 30 short stories. He wrote his first novel, ''The Bounty Hunters'', in 1953 and followed this with four other novels. Five of his westerns were turned into major movies before 1972:&lt;ref name="el-imdb"&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001465/ "Elmore Leonard"], IMDb.&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Tall T]]''&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0051047/ "The Tall T (1957)"], IMDb.&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Randolph Scott]]), ''[[3:10 to Yuma (1957 film)|3:10 to Yuma]]''&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0050086/ "Trein van tien over drie (1957)"], IMDb.&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Glenn Ford]]), ''[[Hombre (film)|Hombre]]''&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0061770/ "Hombre (1967)"], IMDb.&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Paul Newman]]), ''[[Valdez Is Coming]]''&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0067921/ "Valdez Is Coming (1971)"], IMDb.&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Burt Lancaster]]), and ''[[Joe Kidd]]''&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0068768/ "Joe Kidd (1972)"], IMDb.&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Clint Eastwood]]).

He went on to write seventeen novels and stories in the [[Mystery fiction|mystery]], crime, and more topical genres which were made into movies between 1969 and 2013.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

In 1985, his breakout novel, ''[[Glitz (novel)|Glitz]]'' was published. At the time of his death he had sold tens of millions of copies of his novels.&lt;ref name="freep"&gt;"Novelist elevated crime thriller, mastered dialogue"; Julie Hinds; Detroit Free Press; August 21, 2013; page A1&lt;/ref&gt;

Among film adaptations of his work are ''[[Jackie Brown]]'' (starring [[Pam Grier]], directed by [[Quentin Tarantino]]) which is a "homage to the author’s trademark rhythm and pace";&lt;ref name="freep"/&gt; ''[[Get Shorty (film)|Get Shorty]]'' (1995, [[John Travolta]] and [[Gene Hackman]]); and ''[[Out of Sight]]'' (1998, [[George Clooney]] and [[Jennifer Lopez]], directed by [[Steven Soderbergh]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/08/20/showbiz/elmore-leonard-obit/index.html | work=CNN | title=Elmore Leonard, writer of sharp, colorful crime stories, dead at 87 - CNN.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
He married Beverly Clare Cline in 1949, and they had five children together—three daughters and two sons&lt;ref name="BookJacket"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Comfort to the enemy and other Carl Webster tales|url = https://books.google.com/books/about/Comfort_to_the_Enemy.html?id=UqIsAQAAIAAJ|last = Leonard|first = Elmore|isbn = 0297856685|oclc = 302068307|accessdate = 2013-08-20|publisher = [[Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson]]|year = 2009|location = London}}&lt;/ref&gt;—before divorcing in 1977.  His second marriage in 1979, to Joan Leanne Lancaster (aka Joan Shepard), ended with her death in 1993. Later that same year, he married Christine Kent, and they divorced in 2012.&lt;ref name="DetroitObit"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Elmore Leonard, the 'Dickens of Detroit,' wrote with gritty flair |date=August 20, 2013 |url=http://www.detroitnews.com/article/20130820/ENT09/308200051 |accessdate=2013-08-20 |last=Whitall |first=Susan |work=[[The Detroit News]] |department=Entertainment |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130820134935/http://www.detroitnews.com/article/20130820/ENT09/308200051 |archivedate=August 20, 2013 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT Obit"&gt;{{cite news|last=Stasio|first=Marilyn|title=Elmore Leonard, Who Refined the Crime Thriller, Dies|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/21/books/elmore-leonard-master-of-crime-fiction-dies-at-87.html|accessdate=2013-08-20|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=August 20, 2013|authorlink=Marilyn Stasio|department= Books|deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IMDb"&gt;{{cite web|title=Elmore Leonard - Biography| url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001465/bio|publisher=[[Internet Movie Database|IMDb.com]]|accessdate=2013-08-20|year=2013|deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leonard spent the last years of his life with his family in [[Oakland County, Michigan]]. He suffered a [[stroke]] on July 29, 2013. Initial reports stated that Leonard was recovering,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Elmore Leonard in hospital recovering from stroke |date=August 5, 2013 |url=http://www.detroitnews.com/article/20130805/ENT06/308050096 |last=Whitall |first=Susan |work=[[The Detroit News]] |accessdate=2013-08-21 |deadurl=yes |department=Entertainment |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130824154921/http://www.detroitnews.com/article/20130805/ENT06/308050096 |archivedate=August 24, 2013 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; but on August 20, 2013, Leonard died at his home in the [[Detroit]] suburb of [[Bloomfield Hills]] of stroke complications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://azstarnet.com/gallery/entertainment/books-and-literature/photos-elmore-leonard/collection_fc8e312a-05e3-11e3-85dc-0019bb2963f4.html |title=Photos: Elmore Leonard dies |work=[[Arizona Daily Star]] |date=August 20, 2013 |accessdate=2013-08-21|deadurl = no}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was 87 years old.&lt;ref name=DetroitObit/&gt; Leonard is survived by his five children, 13 grandchildren, and five great-grandchildren.&lt;ref name="NYT Obit" /&gt;

==Writing style==
Commended by critics for his gritty [[realism (arts)|realism]] and strong dialogue, Leonard sometimes took liberties with [[English grammar|grammar]] in the interest of speeding the story along.&lt;ref name="tenrules"/&gt; In his essay "Elmore Leonard's Ten Rules of Writing" he said: "My most important rule is one that sums up the 10: If it sounds like writing, I rewrite it."  He also hinted: "I try to leave out the parts that readers tend to skip."&lt;ref name="tenrules"&gt;{{cite news|last=Leonard|first=Elmore|title=Writers on Writing; Easy on the Adverbs, Exclamation Points and Especially Hooptedoodle|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/07/16/arts/writers-writing-easy-adverbs-exclamation-points-especially-hooptedoodle.html|accessdate=2013-08-20|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=July 16, 2001|department = Arts}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Elmore Leonard has been called "the [[Charles Dickens|Dickens]] of Detroit" because of his intimate portraits of people from that city, though he said, "If I lived in [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]], I'd write about Buffalo."&lt;ref name="tap" /&gt;{{Rp| 90}}  His favorite epithet was one given by Britain's ''[[New Musical Express]]'': "the poet laureate of wild assholes with revolvers".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/culture-obituaries/books-obituaries/10255566/Elmore-Leonard.html The Telegraph, 20 August 2013]. Retrieved 22 January 2017&lt;/ref&gt; His ear for [[dialogue]] has been praised by writers such as [[Saul Bellow]], [[Martin Amis]], and [[Stephen King]]. "Your prose makes [[Raymond Chandler]] look clumsy," Amis told Leonard at a [[Writers Guild of America, West|Writers Guild]] event in [[Beverly Hills]] in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite interview|last = Leonard|first = Elmore|interviewer = [[Martin Amis|Amis, Martin]]|title = Martin Amis interviews Elmore Leonard|date = January 23, 1998|url = http://www.martinamisweb.com/interviews_files/amis_int_leonard.pdf|format = PDF|accessdate = 2013-08-21|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130409202557/http://www.martinamisweb.com/interviews_files/amis_int_leonard.pdf|archivedate = 2013-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stephen King has called him "the great American writer."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = The Tao of Steve|date = February 1, 2007|url = http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,472359,00.html|last = King|first = Stephen|authorlink = Stephen King|work = [[Entertainment Weekly]]|accessdate = 2013-08-21|deadurl = no|publication-date = August 8, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Charles Rzepka of Boston University, Leonard's mastery of [[free indirect speech|free indirect discourse]], a third-person narrative technique that gives the illusion of immediate access to a character's thoughts, "is unsurpassed in our time, and among the surest of all time, even if we include Jane Austen, Gustave Flaubert, and Hemingway in the mix." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last = Rzepka| first = Charles|title = ''Being Cool: The Work of Elmore Leonard''|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|year= 2013|location= Baltimore| page= 21|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SaY-AAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leonard often cited [[Ernest Hemingway]] as perhaps his single most important influence, but at the same time criticized Hemingway for his lack of humor and for taking himself too seriously.&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;[[Mark Lawson]], [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/aug/20/novelist-elmore-leonard-60-years-publishing "Best-selling novelist Elmore Leonard, master of verbal tics and black humour"], ''[[The Guardian]]'', August 20, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;  Still, it was Leonard's affection for Hemingway, as well as [[George V. Higgins]], that led him to will his personal papers to the [[University of South Carolina]], where many of Hemingway's and Higgins' papers are archived.  Leonard's papers reside at the university's Irvin Department of Rare Books and Special Collections.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Elmore Leonard’s Papers (and Hawaiian Shirts) Go to University of South Carolina|date = October 16, 2014|url = http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/10/16/elmore-leonards-papers-and-hawaiian-shirts-go-to-university/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=From 'Get Shorty' to 'Glitz:'10000000002 USC acquires collections of crime novelist Elmore Leonard |date=October 15, 2014 |url=http://www.thestate.com/2014/10/15/3746411_from-get-shorty-to-glitz-usc-acquires.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141204220538/http://www.thestate.com/2014/10/15/3746411_from-get-shorty-to-glitz-usc-acquires.html |archivedate=December 4, 2014 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Elmore Leonard archive goes to South Carolina|date = October 15, 2014|url = http://www.detroitnews.com/story/entertainment/books/2014/10/15/elmore-leonard-archives-university-south-carolina-detroit-crime-author/17299509/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13234">Some individuals and organizations have promoted designs for a [[flag]] representing the planet [[Earth]], though none have been officially recognized as such by any governmental body. The most widely recognized flags associated with Earth are the [[flag of the United Nations]] and the [[Earth Day]] flag.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} Listed below are some of the unofficial contenders for a Flag of Earth:

==John McConnell's "Earth Day" flag==
[[File:Earth Day Flag.png|thumb|350px|The Earth Day flag, John McConnell's latest proposal]]
[[File:EarthFlag1.svg|thumb|350px|McConnell's original design]]

A flag designed by [[John McConnell (peace activist)|John McConnell]] in 1969 for the first [[Earth Day]] is a dark blue field [[Charge (heraldry)|charged]] with ''[[The Blue Marble]]'', a famous [[NASA]] photo of the [[Earth]] as seen from [[outer space]]. The first edition of McConnell's flag used [[screen-printing]] and used different colors: ocean and land were blue and the clouds were white. McConnell presented his flag to the United Nations as a symbol for consideration.&lt;ref name="Weir"&gt;{{cite book|last=Weir|title=Peace, Justice, Care of Earth|year=2007|publisher=Press On Publishing|isbn=0971749124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the political views of its creator and its having become a symbol of Earth Day, the flag is associated with [[Environmentalism|environmental awareness]], and the celebration of the global community.&lt;ref name="Weir"/&gt; It was offered for sale originally in the ''[[Whole Earth Catalog]]'', and is the only flag which was endorsed by McConnell.  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.earthflag.net |title=Authentic Earth Flag |publisher=Earthflag.net |date= |accessdate=2010-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Blue Marble'' image was placed in the public domain, and the public nature of this image was the basis of a legal battle that resulted in the invalidation of a trademark and copyright that was originally issued to the Earth Day flag through its original promotional entity, World Equity, Inc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tabberone.com/Trademarks/CopyrightLaw/Copyrightability/articles/EarthFlagVsAlamoFlag_A.shtml|title=Copyright Law - Copyrightability - Articles - Copyright Protection Not Available for Earth Flag|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This does not invalidate the official history of McConnell's flag, only the official documentation that was issued on it.&lt;ref name="Weir"/&gt;

===One Flag in Space===
The One Flag in Space initiative is an offshoot of the Space Generation Congress (SGC), the Space Generation Advisory Council's yearly world meeting. It promotes usage of the ''Blue Marble'' flag for [[space exploration]] (it does not explicitly mention it being McConnell's design).

==United Nations flag==
[[File:Flag of the United Nations.svg|thumb|350px|The [[Flag of the United Nations]]]]

Adopted in 1946, the [[flag of the United Nations]] has been used to indicate world unity, although it technically only represents the [[United Nations]] itself. It has a geographical representation of the planet, and its high visibility usage makes it a well-known contender for representing Earth. During the planning for NASA's moon landings of the 1960s, it was suggested that a UN flag be used in place of the flag of the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Platoff |first=Anne |title=Where No Flag Has Gone Before: Political and Technical Aspects of Placing a Flag on the Moon (NASA Contractor Report 188251) |publisher=[[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] |date=August 2003 |url=https://www.jsc.nasa.gov/history/flag/flag.htm |accessdate=2017-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=="World Peace Flag" of Universal Peace Congress==
{{main|Peace flag#Earth flag}}
[[File:Peace Congress flag.svg|thumb|350px|Van Kirk's World Peace Flag]]

James William van Kirk, a minister from Youngstown, Ohio, designed in 1913 a [[peace flag]] with [[Rainbow flag|rainbow stripes]], stars and a globe. With this flag, he twice made a peace tour through Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Corien Glaudemans, 'Een vredesapostel uit Ohio', in: ''Den Haag Centraal'', 16 oktober 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Universal Peace Congress]] adopted this flag as its World Peace Flag.&lt;ref&gt;Devere Allen, "The Fight for Peace". 1940. p.553.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Olympic flag ==
[[File:Olympic flag.svg|thumb|right|350px|[[Olympic flag]]]]
Designed by [[Pierre de Coubertin]] in 1914 and adopted in [[Olympic games]] since 1920, the [[Olympic flag]] represents all mankind and has a white bar with 5 interlocking rings of 5 colors. The five rings represent the five [[continent]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.olympic.org/Documents/Reports/EN/en_report_1303.pdf|title=The Olympic symbols|publisher=[[International Olympic Committee]]|accessdate=2014-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The six colors (including the white color of the background) represent all of the world's nations.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.olympic.org/Documents/Reports/EN/en_report_1303.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== "World Citizen" flag of World Service Authority ==
[[File:World Citizen Flag.svg|thumb|right|350px|World Citizen flag by Garry Davis]]
The [[Global citizenship#World citizen|World Citizen]] is a [[social movement]] for global [[citizenship]] under a proposed [[world government]]. In 1953, one of its activists, [[Garry Davis]], founded the [[World Service Authority]], which sells the [[World Passport]] (a fantasy travel document) with a proposed flag of the world.&lt;ref name="European Council"&gt;[http://register.consilium.europa.eu/pdf/en/08/st16/st16225.en08.pdf Table of travel documents entitling the holder to cross the external borders and which may be endorsed with a visa - (Parts II and II) and Part V (documents to which visas cannot be affixed].

===James W. Cadle's "Flag of Earth"===
[[File:Flag of Earth.svg|thumb|350px|Flag of Earth by James Cadle]]
Another Earth flag was created around the same time in 1970 by a farmer from [[Homer, Illinois]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flagofearth.org/flown.html|title=The Flag of Earth - Flown|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; named James W. Cadle. Cadle's version of the Earth flag consists of a blue circle representing Earth in the center of the flag, a segment of a large yellow circle representing the sun and a small white circle for the moon, all on a black background. It is particularly popular amongst [[SETI]] researchers and is used by SETI worldwide. {{cn|date=June 2018}} The flag flies at the [[Ohio State University Radio Observatory]] and was lowered to [[half mast]] when [[Carl Sagan]] died.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.xs4all.nl/~carlkop/sagan.html |title=Carl Sagan |publisher=Xs4all.nl |date= |accessdate=2010-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flag of Earth Co. International was also founded by Cadle which sold the flag. The Flag of Earth became [[public domain]] in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flagofearth.org/original.html|title=James Cadle's Flag of Earth Home Page|last=Cadle|first=James  W.|date=|website=|publisher=North American AstroPhysical Observatory (NAAPO)|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-02|quote="The Flag of Earth is now 34-years-old, and on November 1, 2003, became part of the public domain."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Paul Carroll's "World Flag"===
[[File:The world flag 2006.svg|thumb|right|350px|The combined World Flag in 2006]]
The World Flag is an international flag created in 1988 by Paul Carroll to act as a symbol to inspire "positive global change while continuing to embrace and celebrate cultural diversity.&lt;ref name="WorldFlagProjectVision"&gt;{{cite web|title=Vision|url=http://www.theworldflag.org/vision.php|website=WorldFlagProject.org|publisher=The World Flag Project|accessdate=30 November 2015|ref=World Flag Project Vision}}&lt;/ref&gt;"  The current 2008 version of the combined World Flag has a world map 216 flags; including the flags of every [[Member states of the United Nations|UN member state]], the [[United Nations]], and several territories of larger nations.&lt;ref name=WorldFlagProjectVision /&gt;

The World Flag has been flown at the [[Headquarters of the United Nations|UN Headquarters]] for the ''A Prayer for Peace'' event, [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|The World Trade Center]], [[Earth Day]] in [[Central Park]], and at various other events around the world.&lt;ref name=WorldFlagProjectHistory&gt;{{cite web|title=History|url=http://www.theworldflag.org/history.php|website=TheWorldFlag.org|publisher=The World Flag Project|accessdate=30 November 2015|ref=WorldFlagProjectHistory}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Custom Flags|url=http://www.australianflagmakers.com.au/custom-made-flags/|publisher=www.australianflagmakers.com.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oskar Pernefeldt's "International Flag of the Planet Earth"===
[[File:International Flag of Planet Earth.svg|thumb|350px|Oskar Pernefeldt’s proposal]]
In 2015 a Swedish artist, Oskar Pernefeldt,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The International Flag of the Planet Earth|url=http://www.flagofplanetearth.com/#intro-shift|accessdate=22 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; proposed the "International Flag of the Planet Earth".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Here’s what the flag of Planet Earth could look like | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2015/05/21/heres-what-the-flag-of-planet-earth-could-look-like/ | accessdate=23 May 2015 | publisher=[[Washington Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was conceived to be used in space expeditions and it has two main purposes: 
# To be used while representing planet Earth.
# To remind the people of Earth that we share this planet, no matter of national boundaries. That we should take care of each other and the planet we live on.

The creators predict that it will be eventually used in Mars landing in 2025 or in a future colony on that planet. The flag is used by space research groups with intent to implanting a base on [[Mars]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://g1.globo.com/fantastico/noticia/2017/11/pesquisador-brasileiro-visita-estacao-no-deserto-que-simula-planeta-marte.html Pesquisador brasileiro visita estação no deserto que simula planeta Marte], [[Fantástico]], November 12, 2017, 4 minutes and 26 seconds of video&lt;/ref&gt; The design of the flag consists of seven rings intersecting each other and a deep-blue-sea in the background. The rings are centered on the flag forming a flower in the middle, representing life on Earth. The intersection of the rings represent that all things on Earth are linked directly or indirectly. The rings are organized in a [[Borromean rings]]–like fashion, representing not only the [[seven continents]], but how no part of Earth can be removed without the whole structure collapsing. Finally, the deep-blue represents the ocean and the importance of water for life on Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Nusigma {{!}} This Could Become the Official Flag of Planet Earth|url = http://nusigma.in/official-flag-of-planet-earth/|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160210114338/http://nusigma.in/official-flag-of-planet-earth/|dead-url = yes|archive-date = 2016-02-10|website = nusigma.in|access-date = 2016-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Thomas Mandl's "One World Flag"===
[[File:OWF_One_World_Flag_by_Thomas_Mandl.svg|thumb|right|350px|One World Flag]]
The One World Flag is a concept published in 2018 by the German activist and visual artist Thomas Mandl. The design of the flag consists of a blue circle on a translucent blank background. Through the usage of [[Sheer fabrics]], the environment blends into the flag background and thus becomes an integral part of the flag design representing the ever-changing nature of culture, society, politics, and environment of the planet earth. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.br.de/puls/themen/welt/one-world-flag-thomas-mandl-interview-100.html|title=One World, one flag|publisher=Bavarian Broadcasting, BR|accessdate=2018-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Freeway II: Confessions of a Trickbaby''''' is a 1999 [[exploitation film]] and the sequel to ''[[Freeway (1996 film)|Freeway]]'', [[Film writer|written]] and [[film director|directed]] by [[Matthew Bright]]. It stars [[Natasha Lyonne]] as Crystal "White Girl" Van Meter, and [[María Celedonio]] as Angela "Cyclona" Garcia. As the original film was partly inspired by "[[Little Red Riding Hood]]", the second film is somewhat based on "[[Hansel and Gretel]]". The film achieved little attention or notoriety, unlike its predecessor.

==Plot==
Crystal "White Girl" Van Meter is a 15-year-old prostitute who is sentenced to 25 years for a long list of crimes which include beating up and robbing johns. Transferred to a minimum security hospital to seek treatment for [[bulimia]], White Girl teams up with Angela "Cyclona" Garcia, a lesbian teenage serial killer. Together, they escape from the hospital, despite White Girl injuring herself on a barbed-wire fence. Cyclona is convinced her beloved Sister Gomez can help "White Girl" with her eating disorder and they head to Tijuana. On the way, Cyclona murders a family and has sex with the dead bodies. "White Girl" is not happy that Cyclona has stopped taking her meds and insists she continue to take occasional doses should they continue together. They steal the family's car and make their way south. On the way, Cyclona reveals how Sister Gomez saved her from being molested by her father and possibly aliens. After drinking one too many beers and huffing some paint, they crash and fall down a hill laughing.

Undaunted, the two fugitives catch a ride on a freight train only to be assaulted by a transient crack addict. Cyclona kills him to protect White Girl, and the two make off with his bag of crack and guns. Venturing into the woods, they leave a trail of crack which is picked away by shady men with crow feathers on their hats. Lost and confused, they make it to the border only to have a stand-off with two customs officials, both of whom Cyclona kills. "White Girl" violently pistol-whips Cyclona and after making her point, the two race to the suburbs of Tijuana.

In Tijuana, Crystal/White Girl makes money by luring men to dark alleys on the promise of a good time, and mugging them. Cyclona and White Girl check into a run-down motel where they have a moment with beer, a shower and a vibrating bed. White Girl finally gives into Cyclona's sexual advances toward her and the two of them engage in some rampant lesbian sex.

After a few days, the two lovers find a poster that shows Sister Gomez is in town. Sister Gomez appears to be a Catholic/spiritualist healer; Cyclona is very keen that they visit her, for Sister Gomez has protected her from abuse in the past, and might be able to help them. They visit Sister Gomez at her gaudy mission house. Sister makes an enormous roast feast for her "little movie star" (Cyclona) and the friend "with the hungry demon" (Crystal), referring to her bulimia. Cyclona then disappears as White Girl is forced to work for Sister Gomez in the same way as she has been doing, in exchange for food. Finally, Crystal grows weary and makes her way to the basement, where she finds small children in a bondage room with a U.F.O shaped lantern. There is blood everywhere. Cyclona is hanging half-nude in a bondage style contraption. She tells Crystal that Sister Gomez made her watch while she chopped up children and made food out of them. She reveals that her ultimate plan for Crystal was to fatten her up with the meat of the children, and then, serve Crystal up for dinner as well. Crystal concludes that Sister Gomez is the witch-leader of a bizarre cult that rapes and eats children and then sells the child porn videos, protected by the front of a Catholic mission. Ready to deliver justice, White Girl/Crystal frees Cyclona and kills all the cult members; she also reveals Sister Gomez to be a rather well-endowed man. Not succumbing to bullets, Gomez is thrown in the oven. Burning, Gomez screams of his 100,000 years of terror and the revenge from his father Jupiter that will ensue. Crystal, keeping a promise made earlier, is forced to kill Cyclona in a tearful scene rather than allow her to be captured. Cyclona, wishing to leave behind a life of abuse and violence, hopes to be reincarnated as an eagle (we discover that Sister Gomez was her earliest abuser). White Girl makes a deal with the federales and leaves with her lawyer/pimp, stating "I'm not hungry anymore."

'''Gothic fashion''' is a clothing style marked by conspicuously dark, mysterious, antiquated and homogeneous features. It is worn by members of the [[Goth subculture]]. A dark, sometimes morbid fashion and style of [[clothing|dress]],&lt;ref name="grunenberg2"&gt;{{harvnb|Grunenberg|1997|p=172}}&lt;/ref&gt; typical gothic fashion includes a pale complexion with [[Hair colouring|colored]] black hair, black lips and black clothes.&lt;ref name="grunenberg2" /&gt; Both male and female goths can wear dark [[Eye liner|eyeliner]] and dark fingernail polish most especially black. Styles are often borrowed from the [[punk fashion]], [[Victorian fashion|Victorians]] and [[1550–1600 in Western European fashion#Elizabethan Style|Elizabethan]]s.&lt;ref name=grunenberg2/&gt; Goth fashion is sometimes confused with [[heavy metal fashion]] and [[emo#Fashion|emo fashion]].

==Characteristics==
[[Image:Whitby goth couple.jpg|thumb|right|A male and female Goth couple]]
Cintra Wilson declares that "The origins of contemporary goth style are found in the [[Victorian fashion|Victorian]] cult of mourning."&lt;ref name=cintra/&gt; [[Valerie Steele]] is an expert in the history of the style.&lt;ref name=cintra/&gt;

[[File:Model Sandi J., Goth Subculture in Cleveland, Ohio.jpg|thumb|Goth Model Sandi J.]]Goth fashion can be recognized by its stark [[black]] clothing. [[Ted Polhemus]] described goth fashion as a "profusion of black velvets, lace, fishnets and leather tinged with scarlet or purple, accessorized with tightly laced corsets, gloves, precarious stilettos and silver jewelry depicting religious or occult themes".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Polhemus|1994|p=97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nancy Kilpatrick's ''Goth Bible: A Compendium for the Darkly Inclined'' defines "[[poseur]]" for the goth scene as follows: "goth wannabes, usually young kids going through a goth phase who do not hold to goth sensibilities but want to be part of the goth crowd (...)". Kilpatrick contributor "Daoine O'" denigrates poseur goths as 'Batbabies' whose clothing is bought at [mall store] [[Hot Topic]] with their parents' money".&lt;ref&gt;Nancy Kilpatrick. ''Goth Bible: A Compendium for the Darkly Inclined''. St. Martin's Griffin, 2004, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;

==Icons==
One female role model is [[Theda Bara]], the 1910s [[femme fatale]] known for her dark eyeshadow.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hannaham|1997|p=93}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="steele26"&gt;{{harvnb|Steele|Park|2008|p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Siouxsie Sioux]] was particularly influential on the dress style of the [[Gothic rock]] scene; [[Paul Morley]] of ''[[NME]]'' described [[Siouxsie and the Banshees]]' 1980 gig at Futurama: "[Siouxsie was] modeling her newest outfit, the one that will influence how all the girls dress over the next few months. About half the girls at Leeds had used Sioux as a basis for their appearance, hair to ankle."&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, p. 425.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Smith (musician)|Robert Smith]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hannaham|1997|p=113}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Musidora]], [[Bela Lugosi]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Steele|Park|2008|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bettie Page]], [[Maila Nurmi|Vampira]], [[Morticia Addams]],&lt;ref name=steele26/&gt; [[Nico]], [[Rozz Williams]], [[David Bowie]],&lt;ref name=grunenberg2/&gt; [[Lux Interior]],&lt;ref name=grunenberg2/&gt; [[Dave Vanian]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Steele|Park|2008|p=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; are also style icons. The 1980s established designers such as [[Drew Bernstein|Drew Bernstein of Lip Service]], while the 1990s saw a surge of US-based gothic fashion designers, many of whom continue to evolve the style through the current day. Style magazines such as [[Gothic Beauty]] have given repeat features to a select few gothic fashion designers who began their labels in the 1990s, such as [[Kambriel]], [[Rose Mortem]], and Tyler Ondine of Heavy Red.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Holiday |first=Steven |date= 12 December 2014 |title= Gothic Beauty |url= http://www.gothicbeauty.com |journal= |location= Portland, OR |publisher=Holiday Media |access-date= 12 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Influential goth models include [[Wednesday Mourning]], [[Adora BatBrat]] and Lady Amaranth.

In 1977, [[Karl Lagerfeld]] hosted the Soirée Moratoire Noir party, specifying "tenue tragique noire absolument obligatoire" (black tragic dress absolutely required).&lt;ref name=steele35&gt;{{harvnb|Steele|Park|2008|p=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; The event included elements associated with [[leather subculture|leatherman]] style.&lt;ref name=steele35/&gt;

Goth fashion has a reciprocal relationship with the fashion world.

===Gothic lolita===
[[Gothic lolita]], sometimes shortened to {{Nihongo||ゴスロリ|''gosu rori''}} in [[Japanese language|Japanese]], is a combination of Gothic and [[lolita fashion]]s.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} The fashion originated in the late 1990s in [[Harajuku]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://uni.opole.pl/~wanke/masowe/Yuniya_Kawamura_-_Japanese_teens_as_producers_of_street_fashion_-_Current_Sociology_5_2006.pdf] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321002750/http://uni.opole.pl/~wanke/masowe/Yuniya_Kawamura_-_Japanese_teens_as_producers_of_street_fashion_-_Current_Sociology_5_2006.pdf |date=March 21, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gothic lolita fashion is characterized by darker make-up and clothing.&lt;ref name="interview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://manga.about.com/od/mangaartistswriters/a/JWinterberg.htm|title=Interview with the Editors of the Gothic and Lolita Bible|author=Aoki, Deb|publisher=[[About.com]]|accessdate=10 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Red lipstick and smokey or neatly defined eyes, created using black eyeliner, are typical styles, although as with all lolita sub-styles the look remains fairly natural.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Anonymous|title=Gothic Lolita Hair and Make Up|work=[[Gothic &amp; Lolita Bible]]|volume=4|publisher=Nuuberuguu|year=2002|page=79}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though Gothic make-up has been associated with a white-powdered face, this is usually considered poor taste within the (largely Japanese) lolita fashion scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Anonymous|title=Neo Gothic Style|work=[[Gothic &amp; Lolita Bible]]|volume=4|publisher=Nuuberuguu|year=2002|page=81}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brands which exemplify the Gothic lolita style include Atelier-Pierrot, Atelier Boz, Black Peace Now, [[H. Naoto|H. Naoto Blood]] and [[Moi-même-Moitié]]. Author and TV Host [[La Carmina]] is a popular model of Gothic lolita fashion.

===Aristocrat===
[[Aristocrat (fashion)|Aristocrat]] is a type of [[Japanese street fashion]], championed by the [[visual kei]] rock musician [[Mana (Japanese musician)|Mana]] with his fashion label [[Moi-même-Moitié]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Anonymous|title=Artist Brands: Part 1, Mana x Moi-mene-Moitie|work=[[Gothic &amp; Lolita Bible]]|volume=4|publisher=Nuuberguu|year=2002|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and influenced by gothic and [[Neo-Victorian]] fashions. A typical outfit will combine elements of [[fetish wear]] with Victorian and sometimes [[steampunk]] fashions, including [[tight pants]], velvet sportcoats, [[top hat]]s, [[cravat]]s, [[corset]]s, ankle length skirts, lace [[petticoat]]s, and the frilly [[pirate shirt]]s previously popularised by the [[New Romantics]] of the 1980s.

===Cybergoth===
[[File:Green ^ Lights - Flickr - SoulStealer.co.uk.jpg|thumb|right|Two cybergoths]]
The [[Cybergoth]] and [[rivethead]] subcultures emerged in America during the late 1990s, and combined classic gothic fashions such as leather [[duster coat]]s, [[tripp pants]] or Demonia brand [[platform boots]] with the clothing worn by fans of [[industrial metal]] and [[rave music]] to create a [[dystopian]], [[futuristic]] [[science fiction]] look.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2002/09/13/1031608320631.html Dead fashionable].

Russian Consul in Simferopol Vladimir Andreyev provoked public controversy for his comments that the film "distorts the truth" with its failure to mention alleged [[collaborationism]] by Crimean Tatars during [[Reichskommissariat Ukraine|Nazi Germany's occupation of Ukraine]]. Members of the public took offence, and on 23 May 2013 about 300 people held a protest outside the consulate demanding that Andreyev be declared ''[[persona non grata]]'', while the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Ukraine)|Ukrainian Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] described Andreyev's remarks as "inappropriate". Andreyev initially stood by his remarks and refused to retract them, but the following day the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Russia)|Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] also described Andreyev's words as inappropriate and incorrect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://en.ria.ru/russia/20130523/181312132-print/Crimean-Tatars-Rally-to-Expel-Russian-Consul.html|title=Crimean Tatars Rally to Expel Russian Consul|work=RIA Novosti|date=2013-05-23|accessdate=2013-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://rianovosti.com/russia/20130524/181317658.html|title=Russia Admits Crimea Consul's Words Were 'Incorrect'|work=RIA Novosti|date=2013-05-24|accessdate=2013-06-19|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20131023145924/http://rianovosti.com/russia/20130524/181317658.html|archivedate=23 October 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''International Gothic''' is a period of [[Gothic art]] which began in [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy]], France, and northern Italy in the late 14th and early 15th century.&lt;ref&gt;Ingo F. Walther, Robert Shia Lebouf Wundram, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=O7YSKD3scdcC&amp;pg=PA22 Masterpieces of Western Art: A History of Art in 900 Individual Studies from the Gothic to the Present Day]'', Taschen, 2002, {{ISBN|3-8228-1825-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; It then spread very widely across Western Europe, hence the name for the period, which was introduced by the French art historian [[Louis Courajod]] at the end of the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, 8&lt;/ref&gt;

Artists and portable works, such as [[illuminated manuscript]]s, travelled widely around the continent, leading to a common aesthetic among the royalty and higher nobility and considerably reducing the variation in national styles among works produced for the courtly elites. The main influences were northern France, the [[Netherlands]], the [[Duchy of Burgundy]], the [[Holy Roman Emperor|Imperial]] court in [[Prague]], and Italy. Royal marriages such as that between [[Richard II of England]] and [[Anne of Bohemia]] helped to spread the style.

It was initially a style of courtly sophistication, but somewhat more robust versions spread to art commissioned by the emerging mercantile classes and the smaller nobility.  In Northern Europe "Late Gothic" continuations of the style, especially in its decorative elements, could still be found until the early 16th century, as no alternative decorative vocabulary emerged locally to replace it before [[Renaissance]] revival of [[Classicism]].  
[[Image:Simone Martini 078.jpg|thumb|Detail of the ''[[Annunciation Triptych (Simone Martini)|Annunciation]]'' (1333) by the Sienese [[Simone Martini]], Uffizi]]

Usage of the terms by art historians varies somewhat, with some using the term more restrictively than others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wga.hu/tours/gothic/definiti.html WGA: Definition of the International Gothic style]&lt;/ref&gt;  Some art historians feel the term is "in many ways ... not very helpful ... since it tends to skate over both differences and details of transmission."&lt;ref&gt;Syson and Gordon, 58&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
The important [[Kingdom of Bohemia|Bohemian]] version of the style developed in the court of [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor]] in Prague, which for a brief period&lt;ref&gt;Prague's prominence as a style-setting center was repeated with the [[Mannerism]] of the court of [[Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Rudolph II]] in the late 16th century.&lt;/ref&gt; became a leading force in the development of European art. Charles came from the [[Luxembourg dynasty]], was tutored by the future [[Pope Clement VI]], and as a youth spent seven years at the French court, as well as visiting Italy twice. This and family relationships gave him intimate links with the various courts of France, including that of the [[Avignon Papacy]], and from 1363 the separate Valois [[Duchy of Burgundy]] under [[Philip the Bold]]. The Bohemian style initially lacked the elongated figures of other centres, but had a richness and sweetness in female figures that were very influential. Charles had at least one Italian altarpiece, apparently made in Italy and sent to Prague, near where it remains today in his showpiece [[Karlštejn Castle]]. For [[St. Vitus Cathedral]] in Prague, he first used a French architect, and then the German [[Peter Parler]].&lt;ref&gt;Levey, 24-7, 37 &amp; passim&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the development of the style occurred in Italy, and it probably spread north of the Alps to influence France partly through the colony of Italian artists attached to the Papal Court at Avignon, and the works displayed from the residence there in the 1330s and 1340s of [[Simone Martini]], a [[Sienese school|Sienese]] precursor of the style. [[Republic of Siena|Republican Siena]] had a large influence on the development of the style, but kept to its own dignified Gothic style throughout the period, and afterwards, while the flamboyant [[house of Visconti|Visconti]] court at Milan, also closely related to the French royal family, was the most important Italian centre of the courtly style.&lt;ref&gt;Syson &amp; Gordon, 59–60&lt;/ref&gt; As the style developed in Northern Europe, Italian artists were in turn influenced by it.

The marriage in 1384 between the young King [[Richard II of England]] and Charles IV's daughter [[Anne of Bohemia]] helped to connect [[Prague]] and London, and bring the style to England, although Anne died in 1394.

==Royal portraits==
A number of central works of International Gothic work are [[votive portrait]]s of monarchs with a sacred figure – in some cases being received into [[Heaven]] by them, as with a miniature of [[Jean, Duc de Berry]], and some of his relatives, being welcomed by Saint Peter in the ''[[Grandes Heures du Duc de Berry]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Levey, 12–38, discusses several of these. The Berry miniature is [[BnF]] MS. Lat. 919, f.96R. They also have [[Gian Galeazzo Visconti]] being received into Heaven on MSfonds. Lat. 5888&lt;/ref&gt;  From this period come the earliest surviving panel portraits of monarchs, and royal manuscripts show a greatly increased number of realistic portraits of the monarch who commissioned them.

=== Architecture ===
In [[Gothic architecture|architecture]], where the style was long-lasting, local varieties of it are often known as [[English Gothic architecture#Perpendicular Gothic|Perpendicular architecture]] in England, and as [[Sondergotik]] in Germany and Central Europe, [[Flamboyant Gothic]] in [[France]], and later the [[Manueline]] in [[Portugal]], and the [[Isabelline Gothic|Isabelline]] in [[Spain]].

=== Painting and sculpture ===
In painting and sculpture, the style is sometimes known in German as the "Schöne Stil" or "Weicher Stil" ("Beautiful style" or "Soft style").&lt;ref&gt;The German equivalent "Weicher Stil" was introduced by H. Börger and found wide reception through the works of Wilhelm Pinder. Czech art historians coined the term "Beautiful Style" (Schöner Stil), particularly because of a number of "Schöne Madonnen" or "Beautiful Madonnas".&lt;/ref&gt;  Stylistic features are a dignified elegance, which replaces monumentality, along with rich decorative colouring, elongated figures and flowing lines.  It also makes a more practised use of perspective, modelling, and setting. Figures begin to be given more space in their settings, and interest is taken in realistically depicted plants and animals.  In some works, above all the famous calendar scenes of the [[Très Riches Heures du Duc de Berry]], the beginnings of real landscape painting are seen.  Decoration became increasingly ornate as the style developed in Northern Europe, whereas in Italy the increased sophistication of figure painting was absorbed into [[Early Renaissance painting]].

In sculpture the leading Italian artists remained closer to classicism, and were less affected by the movement; [[Lorenzo Ghiberti]] is in many respects close to the style, but already seems infused with Early Renaissance classicism. [[Claus Sluter]] was the leading sculptor in Burgundy, and was one artist able to use the style with a strongly monumental effect.  Most sculptors are unknown, and the style tended to survive longer in Northern sculpture than painting, as the detailed realism of [[Early Netherlandish painting]] was harder to translate into sculpture. Smaller painted wood figures, most often of the Madonna, were significant, and being relatively portable, probably helped to disseminate the style across Europe.
[[Image:Folio 25v - The Garden of Eden.jpg|thumb|left|The ''Garden of Eden'' from the [[Très Riches Heures du Duc de Berry]] by the [[Limbourg Brothers]], 1410s]]

Notable painters included [[Master Theoderic]] and the [[Master of the Třeboň Altarpiece]] in Bohemia, the [[Master of the Parement]], [[Jacquemart de Hesdin]] and the Netherlandish [[Limbourg brothers]] in France, and [[Gentile da Fabriano]], [[Lorenzo Monaco]] and [[Pisanello]] in Italy, the last taking the style into the [[Early Renaissance]].  In Burgundy [[Jean Malouel]], [[Melchior Broederlam]] and [[Henri Bellechose]] were succeeded by [[Robert Campin]] and [[Jan van Eyck]] who took Early Netherlandish painting in the direction of greater illusionism. [[Master Bertram]] and [[Conrad von Soest]] were leading regional masters in Germany, working largely for city burghers.  Surviving panel paintings of the best quality from before 1390 are very rare except from Italy and the Prague court.  Many of these artists moved between countries or regions during their careers, exposing them to the styles of other centres.  In particular Broederlam had spent some years in Italy, and it has been speculated that the Master of the Parement was himself Bohemian, as his known French works are very few, and extremely close to Bohemian art.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, 12&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Illuminated manuscript]]s remained important vehicles of the style, and in works like the [[Sherborne Missal]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[British Library]]  |url=http://www.bl.uk/onlinegallery/sacredtexts/ttpbooks.html |title=Turn the pages of eight sacred texts on screen }}&lt;/ref&gt; were the main English contribution, apart from the [[stained glass]] of [[John Thornton (glass painter)|John Thornton]] in [[York Minster]] and of [[Thomas Glazier]] in [[Oxford]] and elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;Marks and Morgan, 29&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nottingham alabaster]] carvings, produced in considerable quantities by workshops to standard patterns, were exported all over Western Europe to value-conscious parish churches. The [[Hours of Gian Galeazzo Visconti]] from [[Milan]] was a key work, as was the [[Wenceslas Bible]] (with the text in German) of Charles IV's son. Both, like the Sherborne Missal, are marked by extravagantly decorated borders. [[John, Duke of Berry]], son and brother of French kings, was the most extravagant commissioner of manuscripts, and the main employer of the Limbourg Brothers and Jacquemart de Hesdin, as well as using many other artists.  Other large-scale collectors included [[Wenceslaus, King of the Romans|Wenceslas]], the son of Charles IV, [[John of Lancaster, 1st Duke of Bedford]], son of [[Henry IV of England]] and "Regent" of English-occupied France, and the Dukes of Burgundy.  In the fifteenth century the cities of [[Flanders]], especially [[Bruges]], came to outstrip Paris as a centre of both manuscript illumination and panel painting.

=== Tapestry ===
[[Image:Meister der Schule von Arras 001.jpg|thumb|[[Arras]] tapestry of about 1410 (the dog and rabbits signify lust)]]
A further vehicle of the International Gothic style was provided by the [[tapestry]]-weaving centers of [[Arras]], [[Tournai]] and Paris,&lt;ref&gt;This paragraph follows Roger-Armand Weigert, ''French Tapestry'' (1956, translated by Donald and Monique King, 1962). Secondary centres mentioned by Weigert are [[Lille]], [[Valenciennes]], [[Cambrai]], [[Enghien]], [[Oudenaarde]] and [[Brussels]]&lt;/ref&gt; where tapestry production was permanently disordered by the English occupation of 1418–36.  Under the consistent patronage of the [[Dukes of Burgundy]],&lt;ref&gt;Arras was attached to the Burgundian inheritance in 1384 and captured by Louis XI in 1470, after which Arras rapidly declined as a tapestry-weaving centre.&lt;/ref&gt; their courtly International Gothic style, elongated figures, rich details of attire, crowded composition, with figures disposed in tiers, owe their inspiration to manuscript illuminators and directly to painters: Baudouin de Bailleul, a painter established at Arras, supplied [[cartoon]]s for tapestry workshops there and at Tournai, where elements of a local style are hard to distinguish (Weigert, p.&amp;nbsp;44). The Chatsworth ''[[Devonshire Hunting Tapestries|Hunts]]'' ([[Victoria and Albert Museum]]) are inspired by [[Gaston III of Foix-Béarn|Gaston de Foix]]'s book on hunting and the many weavings of [[Trojan War]] cycles by contemporary romances.

Tapestry too was an art that was portable. Suites accompanied their seigneurial owners from one unheated and empty château to another. Tapestry weavers themselves could be induced to move workshops, though they remained tied to the accessibility of English wool. Religious and secular subjects vied in this essentially secular art.&lt;ref&gt;Tapestries that have been preserved in the treasuries of cathedrals have originally been the gifts of their owners, as have those in today's museums.&lt;/ref&gt;

A medium of Late Gothic style that is easily overlooked because it has virtually entirely disappeared is that of painted hangings, which served as a less expensive substitute for woven hangings but could be produced, with appropriate themes, on short notice.

==Peak of the movement==
In a period lasting approximately between 1390 and 1420 there was a particularly close correspondence between works produced far apart in Europe. In the north the miniatures of the ''Très Riches Heures'' Limbourg brothers, in Italy the ''[[Adoration of the Magi (Lorenzo Monaco)|Adoration of the Magi]]'' of Lorenzo Monaco, and sculpture and miniatures in many countries show very stylised tall figures, the older men with imposingly long beards and swaying figures.  Exotic clothes, based loosely on those of the contemporary Middle East or [[Byzantine Empire]], are worn by figures in biblical scenes; many figures seem to be included just to show off these costumes.  The number of figures in many standard religious scenes is greatly increased; the Magi have large retinues, and the Crucifixion often becomes a crowded event.  This innovation was to survive the style itself.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Ending of the International moment==
[[Image:Gentile da Fabriano 002.jpg|thumb|[[Gentile da Fabriano]]'s ''[[Adoration of the Magi (Gentile da Fabriano)|Adoration of the Magi]]'' (1423–5) &lt;br&gt; Tempera on wood, 300 x 282&amp;nbsp;cm.]] 
The unveiling of Gentile da Fabriano's ''[[Adoration of the Magi (Gentile da Fabriano)|Adoration of the Magi]]'' (below) in Florence in 1423, "the culminating work of International Gothic painting", was almost immediately followed by the painting of the [[Brancacci Chapel]] by [[Masolino]] and [[Masaccio]] (1424–26), which was recognised as a breakthrough to a new style.&lt;ref&gt;Hyman, pp. 139–140.  Quote p. 140&lt;/ref&gt;  In similar fashion the Limbourg brothers' masterpiece the [[Très Riches Heures du Duc de Berry]] was followed within a few years by the [[Turin-Milan Hours]], a continuation of a manuscript started decades before by the Parement Master for the Duke of Berry, which despite a Gothic framework pioneered a very different style of painting.

But outside Florence and the leading courts the International Gothic still held sway, gradually developing in directions that once again diverged considerably between Italy and Europe north of the Alps. The arts and architecture transitioned into the [[Early Renaissance]].

The history of '''Irish art''' starts around 3200 BC with [[Neolithic]] [[petroglyph|stone carvings]] at the [[Newgrange]] megalithic tomb, part of the [[Brú na Bóinne]] complex, County Meath. In early-[[Prehistoric Ireland#Copper and Bronze Ages (2500–500 BC)|Bronze Age Ireland]] there is evidence of [[Beaker culture]] and a widespread metalworking. Trade-links with Britain and Northern Europe introduced [[La Tène culture]] and [[Celtic art]] to Ireland by about 300 BC, but while these styles later changed or disappeared under the Roman subjugation, Ireland was left alone to develop Celtic designs: notably [[Celtic cross]]es, [[Triple spiral|spiral designs]], and the intricate [[Interlace (art)|interlaced]] patterns of [[Celtic knot]]work.
[[File:Blessington lunula.BM.WG.31 (cropped).jpg|thumb|300px|[[Gold lunula]] from [[Blessington]], Ireland, Late Neolithic/Early Bronze Age, c. 2400 BC – 2000 BC, Classical group]]

The [[Christianization of Ireland]] in the fifth century AD saw the establishment of monasteries, which acted as centres of scholarship, and led to the flowering of the [[Insular art]] style with its highly decorative [[Insular illumination|illuminated manuscripts]], metalwork and stonework ([[High cross]]es). From around 1200 to 1700, however, Irish art was relatively stagnant, and Irish culture was left comparatively untouched by the influence of [[Renaissance art]].

From the late 17th century, talented artists began to emerge in the fields of [[fine art]], particularly the painting of portraiture and landscapes. The early 18th century saw increased prosperity and establishment of new cultural institutions including the [[Royal Dublin Society]] (1731) and [[Royal Irish Academy]] (1785). In the Victorian era, with a lack of patronage and better opportunities to be found abroad, many Irish artists emigrated to London (portraitists) or Paris (landscapists), which stifled the nascent indigenous scene.  By the dawn of the 20th century, things began to improve. Opportunities began to spring up at home; the [[Celtic Revival]] movement saw a renewed interest in aspects of Celtic culture, [[Hugh Lane]] established the [[Hugh Lane Gallery|Municipal Gallery of Modern Art]], the first public gallery of its kind in the world, and with increased patronage a new generation of homegrown talent and returning emigres gradually formed a solid basis for the regrowth of art in Ireland.  The foundation of an independent Irish State in the early 1920s did not lead to vast improvement in the state of Irelands' visual arts; in the years following Independence, the arts establishment (exemplified by the committee of the [[Royal Hibernian Academy]]) was dominated by traditionalists who steadfastly opposed attempts to bring Irish art into line with modern  European styles.

==Early Irish art==

===Prehistory===
[[File:Ardagh chalice.jpg|thumb|240px|The [[Ardagh Chalice]], c.? 750]]
Irish gold personal ornaments began to be produced within about 200 years either side of 2000 BC, especially in the thin crescent-shaped disks known as [[gold lunula|lunulae]], which was probably first made in Ireland, where over eighty of the hundred odd known examples were found. A range of thin decorated gold discs, bands and plaques, often with pin-holes, were probably attached to clothing, and objects that appear to be earrings have also been found.  By around 1400–1000 BC, heavier thin [[torc]]s and bangles have been found.  The Late [[Bronze Age]] of 900–600 BC saw the peak of the surviving Irish prehistoric goldsmithing, with superbly worked pieces in simple but very sophisticated designs, notably in a type of dress-fastener that looks like a double-ended trumpet curved round so that the two bell mouths are roughly pointing in the same direction. There are also a series of grand gold collars, representing a development of the lunula, with round plates at either end, and a broad corrugated "U"-shaped body, decorated geometrically along the ridges and troughs of the corrugations. Goldwork all but disappears in the [[Iron Age]], except for the late and enigmatic [[Broighter Hoard]] of the 1st century BC, which appears to mix local and Roman pieces.

Although Ireland tends to be strongly associated in the popular mind with [[Celtic art]], the early Continental style of [[Hallstatt culture|Hallstatt]] style never reached Ireland, and the succeeding [[La Tène style]] reached Ireland very late, perhaps from about 300 BC, and has left relatively few remains, which are often described by art historians together with their British contemporaries as "Insular Celtic".  Buried ironwork does not last long in Irish conditions, and gold is very rare, so the survivals are normally in bronze.  The [[Petrie Crown]], [[Loughnashade Trumpet]] and a series of discs whose function is mysterious are among the most striking pieces. The decoration on a number of bronze scabbards, many found in the [[River Bann]], have inspired much discussion, as they seem close to other pieces from as far away as Hungary, and the possibility of an immigrant master has been raised.  The [[National Museum of Ireland]] in [[Dublin]] holds the majority of major finds from the whole prehistoric period, with others in the [[Ulster Museum]] in Belfast and the [[British Museum]] in London.

===Later Irish art===

In Ireland, "[[La Tène art|La Tène]] ornamented material from the third to fifth centuries AD is difficult to demonstrate [from Ireland]".&lt;ref&gt;NMI, 134&lt;/ref&gt; In the 6th to 8th centuries the art of the newly Christianised Irish mixed with Mediterranean and Germanic traditions through Irish missionary contacts with the [[Anglo-Saxons]], creating what is called [[Insular art]] (or the Hiberno-Saxon style) and such masterpieces as the [[Book of Kells]], the [[Ardagh Chalice]] and the [[Tara Brooch]], the most spectacular of about fifty elaborate [[Celtic brooch]]es in precious metal that have been found. The stone [[high cross]] was a distinctive insular type of monument, of which many examples survive. Later in the period, [[Scandinavia]]n influences were added through the [[Vikings]]. These earlier styles largely came to an end with the [[Norman invasion of Ireland|Norman invasion]] of 1169–1170 and the subsequent wide adoption of [[Romanesque art]]. Through the Gothic and Renaissance periods Irish art was essentially a regional variation of wider European styles, with many works imported from England or further afield, and some English artists and craftsmen active in Ireland. Many objects of a distinctively Irish form from the first millennium, such as bell or [[book shrine]] [[reliquaries]], were renovated or repaired in the contemporary style.&lt;ref&gt;NMI, Chapter, 7, ''Later Medieval Ireland''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early Modern period==
[[File:Hugh Douglas Hamilton - Cupid and Psyche in the nuptial bower.jpg|thumbnail|right|''Cupid and Psyche in the nuptial bower'' by [[Hugh Douglas Hamilton]], who trained in Dublin under [[Robert West (painter)|Robert West]]. Oil, 1792-93.]]

The visual arts were slow to develop in Early Modern Ireland, due to political disruption, and the lack of patrons in either government, the church, and wealthy resident landowners or business class interested in art.  Yet beginning in the late 17th century, Irish painting began to develop, especially in portraiture and [[landscape painting]].  These painters typically looked outside Ireland for influence, training and clients who were wealthy enough to afford the purchase of art.  For example, [[Walter Frederick Osborne]] developed his open air painting in France whereas [[William Orpen|Sir William Orpen]] studied in London.  However, what is now the [[National College of Art and Design]] in Dublin has existed since founded as the Dublin Art School in 1746.  Its founder [[Robert West (painter)|Robert West]] had studied drawing and painting at the [[French Academy]] under [[François Boucher]] and [[Jean-Baptiste van Loo]].&lt;ref name=18thC&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.visual-arts-cork.com/irish-artists-eighteenth-century.htm#robertwest |title=Irish Artists: 18th Century: Robert West |work=Encyclopedia of Irish &amp; World Art: 2010 |publisher=visual-arts-cork.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the second half of the 19th century a climate of cultural resurgence and nationalist ideals contributed to the development of an Irish style.  A revived interest in the [[Irish language]] and Celtic history prompted a revival in the Irish visual arts as well. [[Belfast]] born [[Sir John Lavery]] may be the most internationally known painter of this generation.  He trained in [[Glasgow]] and France, but unlike Orpen, maintained close ties to his native land.  In 1928 he was commissioned to paint the symbol of Éire which would be used as the central image on the bank note of the new [[Irish Free State]].  Other paintings embodied the call for independence, such as [[Beatrice Elvery]]'s ''Éire of 1907'' which depicts the history of [[Irish Catholic]]ism with the still-nascent [[Irish Republic]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.neh.gov/news/humanities/1999-01/irish_painting.html] Steward, James Christian.

===Artists===
Early Irish masters include: [[Garret Morphey]], [[Robert Carver (painter)|Robert Carver]], [[George Barrett, Sr.]], [[James Barry (painter)|James Barry]], [[Hugh Douglas Hamilton]].  The Irish impressionists included [[Roderic O'Conor]] and [[Walter Osborne]], with other landscape artists: [[Augustus Nicholas Burke]], [[Susanna Drury]], [[Paul Henry (painter)|Paul Henry]], [[Nick Miller (artist)|Nick Miller]], and Pat Harris.

Notable Irish sculptors have included [[Jerome Connor]], [[John Henry Foley]], [[Augustus Saint-Gaudens]] (born in Dublin, but emigrated to America at six months old), [[Mary Redmond]], [[John Behan (sculptor)|John Behan]] and [[Oliver Sheppard]].  [[Edward Delaney]], [[Rachel Joynt]], and [[Rowan Gillespie]] are contemporary sculptors.  [[Harry Clarke]], [[Sarah Purser]] and [[Evie Hone]] worked in stained glass.

Portraitists have included [[Daniel Maclise]], [[John Lavery]], [[William Orpen]] (both these War Artists in WWI), [[John Butler Yeats]] (father of Jack and William Butler), and [[Henry Jones Thaddeus]].

Apart from [[Francis Bacon (artist)|Francis Bacon]], who left Ireland as a young man, the best-known 20th-century Irish artist was [[Jack Yeats]], brother of the poet, also with an individual style that is hard to classify.  The art of [[Seán Keating]] was poised between Social Realism and Romanticism, and addressed public and political themes in an emerging nation.

Irish [[Modernism]] began with [[Mainie Jellett]], with later participants being [[The White Stag group]], The Exhibition of Living Art, [[Norah McGuinness]], [[Louis le Brocquy]], [[Patrick Scott (artist)|Patrick Scott]], [[Patrick Swift]], and [[John Kingerlee]].  [[Abstract expressionism|Abstract expressionists]] included [[Tony O'Malley]], [[Nano Reid]], [[Patrick Collins (painter)]])&lt;ref name="fallon"&gt;Irish Arts Review Spring 2009: "Patrick Collins: A Modern Celt", Brian Fallon {{cite web |url=http://www.irishartsreview.com/html/vol26_no1/vol26_01.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-07-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101027083620/http://www.irishartsreview.com/html/vol26_no1/vol26_01.htm |archivedate=2010-10-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kevin Samuel Murphy

In [[Northern Ireland]] notable artists have included [[John Luke (artist)|John Luke]], [[Colin Middleton]], [[William Scott (artist)|William Scott]], [[Neil Shawcross]], [[Gladys Maccabe (artist)]], [[Basil Blackshaw]]

===Contemporary art===
Ireland's best known living artists include [[Brian O'Doherty]] an art historian, sculptor, and [[conceptual artist]] who is based in [[New York City]], [[Sean Scully]] an abstract painter who lives and works in New York City, [[Dorothy Cross]], a sculptor and filmmaker and [[James Coleman (Irish artist)|James Coleman]], an installation and video artist.  [[Robert Ballagh]], [[Willie Doherty]], and [[Sean Hillen]] also work in modern media.

Interest in collecting Irish art has expanded rapidly with the economic expansion of the country, primarily focussing on investment in early twentieth century painters.  Support for young Irish artists is still relatively minor compared to their [[Europe]]an counterparts, as the Arts Council's focus has been on improving infrastructure and professionalism in venues.

An exhibition called 'The Art of a Nation: Irish Works from the Allied Irish Bank and Crawford Art Gallery Collection' was held between 13–31 May 2015 at the Mall Galleries, The Mall, London. It celebrated the story of Irish art from 1890s to the present day and included important works by Aloysius O'Kelly, Sir William Orpen, Jack B Yeats, William Scott, Sean Scully and Hughie O'Donoghue. Admission to the exhibition was free and a fully illustrated catalogue was for sale.

''[[Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPA-fr|saʁtʁ|lang}}; 21 June 1905 – 15 April 1980) was a French philosopher, playwright, novelist, political activist, biographer, and [[literary criticism|literary critic]]. He was one of the key figures in the philosophy of [[existentialist|existentialism]] and [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], and one of the leading figures in [[Twentieth-Century French Philosophy|20th-century French philosophy]] and [[Marxism]]. His work has also influenced [[sociology]], [[critical theory]], [[post-colonial theory]], and [[literary studies]], and continues to influence these disciplines.

Sartre was also noted for his [[open relationship]] with prominent feminist and fellow existentialist philosopher and writer [[Simone de Beauvoir]]. Together, Sartre and de Beauvoir challenged the [[culture|cultural]] and [[society|social]] assumptions and expectations of their upbringings, which they considered [[bourgeois]], in both lifestyle and thought. The conflict between oppressive, spiritually destructive [[conformity (psychology)|conformity]] (''mauvaise foi'', literally, "[[bad faith (existentialism)|bad faith]]") and an "[[authenticity (philosophy)|authentic]]" way of "[[being]]" became the dominant theme of Sartre's early work, a theme embodied in his principal philosophical work ''[[Being and Nothingness]]'' (''L'Être et le Néant'', 1943).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=McCloskey |first=Deirdre N.  |title=The Bourgeois Virtues: Ethics for an Age of Commerce |year=2006 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=0-226-55663-8 |page=297}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sartre's introduction to his philosophy is his work ''[[Existentialism Is a Humanism]]'' (''L'existentialisme est un humanisme'', 1946), originally presented as a lecture.

==Biography==

===Early life===

Jean-Paul Sartre was born on 21 June 1905 in [[Paris]] as the only child of Jean-Baptiste Sartre, an officer of the [[French Navy]], and Anne-Marie (Schweitzer).&lt;ref name="Baird1999"&gt;{{Cite book|author=Forrest E. Baird|title=Twentieth Century Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E5IbAQAAMAAJ|accessdate=4 December 2011|date=22 July 1999|publisher=Prentice Hall|isbn=978-0-13-021534-5|page=226}}&lt;/ref&gt; His mother was of [[Alsace|Alsatian]] origin and the first cousin of Nobel Prize laureate [[Albert Schweitzer]], whose father Louis Théophile was the younger brother of Anne-Marie's father.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://roglo.eu/roglo?lang=en&amp;m=NG&amp;n=Louis+Th%C3%A9ophile+Schweitzer&amp;t=PN |title=Louis Théophile Schweitzer |publisher=Roglo.eu |accessdate=18 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
When Sartre was two years old, his father died of an illness, which he most likely contracted in [[Indochina]]. Anne-Marie moved back to her parents' house in [[Meudon]], where she raised Sartre with help from her father Charles Schweitzer, a teacher of German who taught Sartre mathematics and introduced him to [[classics|classical literature]] at a very early age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Brabazon |first=James |title=Albert Schweitzer: A Biography |year=1975 |publisher=Putnam |page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; When he was twelve, Sartre's mother remarried, and the family moved to [[La Rochelle]], where he was frequently bullied.&lt;ref&gt;''Jean-Paul Sartre'', by Andrew N. Leak, (London 2006), page 16-18&lt;/ref&gt;

As a teenager in the 1920s, Sartre became attracted to philosophy upon reading [[Henri Bergson]]'s [[essay]] ''[[Time and Free Will: An Essay on the Immediate Data of Consciousness]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Jean-Paul |first1=Sartre |author2=Arlette Elkaïm-Sartre, Jonathan Webber |title=The Imaginary: A Phenomenological Psychology of the Imagination |origyear=1940 |year=2004 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=0-415-28755-3 |pages=viii}}&lt;/ref&gt; He attended the [[Cours Hattemer]], a private school in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|ref={{harvid|Quelques Anciens Celebres – Hattemar}} |url=http://www.hattemer.fr/fr/l-ecole/association-des-anciens-eleves/# |title=Quelques Anciens Celebres |publisher=Hattemer |accessdate=2015-06-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150618133955/http://www.hattemer.fr/fr/l-ecole/association-des-anciens-eleves/ |archivedate=18 June 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He studied and earned certificates in psychology, history of philosophy, logic, general philosophy, ethics and sociology, and physics, as well as his ''{{Interlanguage link multi|diplôme d'études supérieures|fr}}'' (roughly equivalent to an [[Master of Arts|MA]] thesis) in Paris at the [[École Normale Supérieure]], an institution of higher education that was the alma mater for several prominent French thinkers and intellectuals.&lt;ref name="Schrift"&gt;{{cite book |last=Schrift |first=Alan D. |editor= |others= |title=Twentieth-century French Philosophy: Key Themes and Thinkers |airdate= |origyear= |month= |url= |edition= |series= |year=2006 |publisher=Blackwell Publishing |isbn=1-4051-3217-5 |pages=174–5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (His 1928 MA thesis under the title "L'Image dans la vie psychologique: rôle et nature" ["Image in Psychological Life: Role and Nature"] was supervised by [[Henri Delacroix]].)&lt;ref name="Schrift"/&gt; It was at ENS that Sartre began his lifelong, sometimes fractious, friendship with [[Raymond Aron]].&lt;ref&gt;''Memoirs: fifty years of political reflection'', By Raymond Aron (1990)&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps the most decisive influence on Sartre's philosophical development was his weekly attendance at [[Alexandre Kojève]]'s seminars, which continued for a number of years.&lt;ref&gt;Auffret, D. (2002), Alexandre Kojeve. La philosophie, l'Etat, la fin de l'histoire, Paris: B. Grasset&lt;/ref&gt;

From his first years in the [[École Normale Supérieure|École Normale]], Sartre was one of its fiercest [[prank]]sters.&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Pierre Boulé (2005), [https://books.google.com/books?id=wlukeHj_TKEC&amp;pg=PA53 ''Sartre, self-formation, and masculinities''], p.,53&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cohen-Solal1988p61"&gt;[[Annie Cohen-Solal|Cohen-Solal, Annie]] (1988), [https://books.google.com/books?id=vWbWlhHG-PEC ''Sartre: A Life''], pp. 61–2 quote: "During his first years at the Ecole, Sartre was the fearsome instigator of all the revues, all the jokes, all the scandals."&lt;/ref&gt; In 1927, his [[antimilitarist]] [[satirical]] cartoon in the revue of the school, coauthored with [[Georges Canguilhem]], particularly upset the director [[Gustave Lanson]].&lt;ref name="Gerassi89p76"&gt;John Gerassi (1989), [https://books.google.com/books?id=XStvJEokm7gC&amp;pg=PA76 ''Jean-Paul Sartre: Protestant or protester?''], pp. 76–7&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, with his comrades Nizan, Larroutis, Baillou and Herland,&lt;ref&gt;Godo, Emmanuel (2005), [https://books.google.com/books?id=oT9lAAAAMAAJ ''Sartre en diable''], p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; he organized a [[media prank]] following [[Charles Lindbergh]]'s successful New York City–Paris flight; Sartre &amp; Co. called newspapers and informed them that Lindbergh was going to be awarded an honorary École degree.

In 1929 at the École Normale, he met [[Simone de Beauvoir]], who studied at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]] and later went on to become a noted philosopher, writer, and feminist. The two became inseparable and lifelong companions, initiating a romantic relationship,&lt;ref name="seattletimes.nwsource.com"&gt;{{cite news|first=Clark |last=Humphrey |title=The People Magazine approach to a literary supercouple |work=The Seattle Times |accessdate=20 November 2007 |url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/living/2002648627_teteatete28.html |date=28 November 2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071231192609/http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/living/2002648627_teteatete28.html |archivedate=31 December 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; though they were not [[Monogamy|monogamous]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Siegel |first=Liliane  |title=In the shadow of Sartre |year=1990 |publisher=Collins (London) |isbn=0-00-215336-X |page=182 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first time Sartre took the [[agrégation]], he failed.

Sartre was drafted into the [[French Army]] from 1929 to 1931 and served as a meteorologist for some time.&lt;ref&gt;Ann Fulton, ''Apostles of Sartre: Existentialism in America, 1945–1963'' (Evanston, IL: Northwestern University Press, 1999) 7.&lt;/ref&gt;  He later argued in 1959 that each French person was responsible for the collective crimes during the [[Algerian War of Independence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Le Sueur |first1=James D. |author2=Pierre Bourdieu |title=Uncivil War: Intellectuals and Identity Politics During the Decolonization of Algeria |origyear=2005 |year= 2005|publisher=University of Nebraska Press |isbn=0-8032-8028-9 |page=178}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1931 until 1945, Sartre taught at various [[lycées]] of [[Le Havre]] (at the Lycée de Le Havre, the present-day {{Interlanguage link multi|Lycée François-Ier (Le Havre)|fr}}, 1931–36), [[Laon]] (at the Lycée de Laon, 1936–37), and, finally, Paris (at the [[Lycée Pasteur (Neuilly-sur-Seine)|Lycée Pasteur]], 1937–39, and at the [[Lycée Condorcet]], 1941–44;&lt;ref&gt;[[Harold Bloom]] (ed.), ''Jean-Paul Sartre'', Infobase Publishing, 2009, p. 200.&lt;/ref&gt; see [[#World War II|below]]).

In 1932, Sartre discovered ''[[Voyage au bout de la nuit]]'' by [[Louis-Ferdinand Céline]], a book that had a remarkable influence on him.&lt;ref&gt;[[Simone de Beauvoir]], ''La Force de l'âge'', Gallimard, 1960, p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1933–34, he succeeded Raymond Aron at the [[Institut Français|Institut français d'Allemagne]] in [[Berlin]] where he studied [[Edmund Husserl]]'s phenomenological philosophy. Aron had already advised him in 1930 to read [[Emmanuel Levinas]]'s ''Théorie de l'intuition dans la phénoménologie de Husserl'' (''The Theory of Intuition in Husserl's Phenomenology'').&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Paul Sartre, "Merleau-Ponty vivant", in ''Situations, IV: portraits'', Gallimard, 1964, p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Neo-Hegelianism|Neo-Hegelian]] revival led by [[Alexandre Kojève]] and [[Jean Hyppolite]] in the 1930s inspired a whole generation of French thinkers, including Sartre, to discover Hegel's ''[[Phenomenology of Spirit]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Ursula Tidd, ''Simone de Beauvoir'', Psychology Press, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

===World War II===
In 1939 Sartre was drafted into the French army, where he served as a [[meteorologist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Van den Hoven |first1=Adrian |author2=Andrew N. Leak |others=Andrew N.

It was during this period of confinement that Sartre read [[Martin Heidegger]]'s ''[[Being and Time]]'', later to become a major influence on his own essay on [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenological]] [[ontology]]. Because of poor health (he claimed that his poor eyesight and [[exotropia]] affected his balance) Sartre was released in April 1941. According to other sources, he escaped after a medical visit to the ophthalmologist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bakewell |first=Sarah |authorlink=Sarah Bakewell |date=2016 |title=At the Existentialist Café |publisher=Chatto&amp;Windus |page=158 |isbn=9781473545328 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Given civilian status, he recovered his teaching position at Lycée Pasteur near Paris, settled at the Hotel Mistral. In October 1941 he was given a position at Lycée Condorcet in Paris, replacing a Jewish teacher who had been forbidden to teach by [[Statute on Jews|Vichy law]].

After coming back to Paris in May 1941, he participated in the founding of the underground group ''Socialisme et Liberté'' ("Socialism and Liberty") with other writers [[Simone de Beauvoir]], [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]], [[Jean-Toussaint Desanti]], [[Dominique Desanti]], Jean Kanapa, and École Normale students. In spring of 1941, Sartre suggested with "cheerful ferocity" at a meeting that the ''Socialisme et Liberté'' assassinate prominent war collaborators like [[Marcel Déat]], but de Beauvoir noted his idea was rejected as "none of us felt qualified to make bombs or hurl grenades".{{sfn|Ousby|2000|p=218}} The British historian [[Ian Ousby]] observed that the French always had far more hatred for collaborators than they did for the Germans, noting it was French people like Déat that Sartre wanted to assassinate rather than the military governor of France, General [[Otto von Stülpnagel]], and the popular slogan always was "Death to Laval!" rather than "Death to Hitler!".{{sfn|Ousby|2000|p=225}} In August Sartre and de Beauvoir went to the French Riviera seeking the support of [[André Gide]] and [[André Malraux]]. However, both Gide and Malraux were undecided, and this may have been the cause of Sartre's disappointment and discouragement. ''Socialisme et liberté'' soon dissolved and Sartre decided to write instead of being involved in active resistance. He then wrote ''[[Being and Nothingness]]'', ''[[The Flies]]'', and ''[[No Exit]]'', none of which were censored by the Germans, and also contributed to both legal and illegal literary magazines.

In his essay "Paris under the Occupation", Sartre wrote about the "correct" behavior of the Germans had entrapped too many Parisians into complicity with the occupation, accepting what was unnatural as natural, writing:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Germans did not stride, revolver in hand, through the streets. They did not force civilians to make way for them on the pavement. They would offer seats to old ladies on the Metro. They showed great fondness for children and would pat them on the cheek. They had been told to behave correctly and being well-disciplined, they tried shyly and conscientiously to do so. Some of them even displayed a naive kindness which could find no practical expression.{{sfn|Ousby|2000|p=54}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Sartre noted when Wehrmacht soldiers asked Parisians politely in their German-accented French for directions, people usually felt embarrassed and ashamed as they tried their best to help out the Wehrmacht which led Sartre to remark "We could not be ''natural''".{{sfn|Ousby|2000|p=57-58}} French was a language widely taught in German schools and most Germans could speak at least some French. Sartre himself always found it difficult when a Wehrmacht soldier asked him for directions, usually saying he did not know where it was that the soldier wanted to go, but still felt uncomfortable as the very act of speaking to the Wehrmacht meant he had been complicit in the Occupation.{{sfn|Ousby|2000|p=151}} Ousby wrote: "But, in however humble a fashion, everyone still had to decide how they were going to cope with life in a fragmenting society ... So Sartre's worries ... about how to react when a German soldier stopped him in the street and asked politely for directions were not as fussily inconsequential as they might sound at first. They were emblematic of how the dilemmas of the Occupation presented themselves in daily life".{{sfn|Ousby|2000|p=151}} Sartre wrote the very "correctness" of the Germans caused moral corruption in many people who used the "correct" behavior of the Germans as an excuse for passivity, and the very act of simply trying to live one's day-to-day existence without challenging the occupation aided the "New Order in Europe", which depended upon the passivity of ordinary people to accomplish its goals.{{sfn|Ousby|2000|p=54}}

Throughout the occupation, it was German policy to plunder France and food shortages were always a major problem as the majority of food from the French countryside went to Germany.{{sfn|Ousby|2000|p=70}} Sartre wrote about the "languid existence" of the Parisians as people waited obsessively for the one weekly arrival of trucks bringing food from the countryside that the Germans allowed, writing about how: "Paris would grow peaked and yawn with hunger under the empty sky. Cut off from the rest of the world, fed only through the pity or some ulterior motive, the town led a purely abstract and symbolic life".{{sfn|Ousby|2000|p=70}} Sartre himself lived on a diet of rabbits sent to him by a friend of de Beauvior living in Anjou.{{sfn|Ousby|2000|p=127}} The rabbits were usually in an advanced state of decay full of maggots, and despite being hungry, Sartre once threw out one rabbit as uneatable, saying it had more maggots in it than meat.{{sfn|Ousby|2000|p=127}} Sartre also remarked on conversations at the [[Café de Flore]] between intellectuals had changed, as the fear that one of them might be a ''[[wiktionary:mouche|mouche]]'' (informer) or a writer of the ''[[wiktionary:corbeau|corbeau]]'' (anonymous denunciatory letters) meant that no-one really said what they meant anymore, imposing self-censorship.{{sfn|Ousby|2000|p=148}} Sartre and his friends at the Café de Flore had reasons for their fear; by September 1940, the ''Abwehr'' alone had already recruited 32,000 French people to work as ''mouches'' while by 1942 the Paris ''Kommandantur'' was receiving an average of 1,500 letters/per day sent by the ''corbeaux''.{{sfn|Ousby|2000|p=146}}

Sartre wrote under the occupation Paris had become a "sham", resembling the empty wine bottles displayed in shop windows as all of the wine had been exported to Germany, looking like the old Paris, but hollowed out, as what had made Paris special was gone.{{sfn|Ousby|2000|p=161}} Paris had almost no cars on the streets during the occupation as the oil went to Germany while the Germans imposed a nightly curfew, which led Sartre to remark that Paris "was peopled by the absent".{{sfn|Ousby|2000|p=172}} Sartre also noted that people began to disappear under the occupation writing about how:

&lt;blockquote&gt;One day you might phone a friend and the phone would ring for a long time in an empty flat. You would go round and ring the doorbell, but no-one would answer it. If the ''concierge'' forced the door, you would find two chairs standing close together in the hall with the fag-ends of German cigarettes on the floor between their legs. If the wife or mother of the man who had vanished had been present at his arrest, she would tell you that he had been taken away by very polite Germans, like those who asked the way in the street. And when she went to ask what had happened to them at the offices in the Avenue Foch or the Rue des Saussaies she would be politely received and sent away with comforting words" [No. 11 Rue des Saussaies was the headquarters of the Gestapo in Paris].{{sfn|Ousby|2000|p=173}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Sartre wrote the ''feldgrau'' ("field grey") uniforms of the Wehrmacht and the green uniforms of the Order Police which had seemed so alien in 1940 had become accepted, as people were numbed into accepting what Sartre called "a pale, dull green, unobtrusive strain, which the eye almost expected to find among the dark clothes of the civilians".{{sfn|Ousby|2000|p=170}} Under the occupation, the French often called the Germans ''les autres'' ("the others"), which inspired Sartre's aphorism in his play ''Huis clos'' ("No Exit") of "''l'enfer, c'est les Autres''" ("Hell is other people").{{sfn|Ousby|2000|p=168}} Sartre intended the line  "''l'enfer, c'est les Autres''" at least in part to be a dig at the German occupiers.{{sfn|Ousby|2000|p=168}}

After August 1944 and the [[Liberation of Paris]], he wrote ''[[Anti-Semite and Jew]]''. In the book he tries to explain the [[etiology]] of "hate" by analyzing [[antisemitic|antisemitic hate]]. Sartre was a very active contributor to ''[[Combat (newspaper)|Combat]]'', a newspaper created during the clandestine period by [[Albert Camus]], a philosopher and author who held similar beliefs. Sartre and de Beauvoir remained friends with Camus until 1951, with the publication of Camus's ''[[The Rebel (book)|The Rebel]]''. Later, while Sartre was labeled by some authors as a resistant, the French philosopher and resistant [[Vladimir Jankelevitch]] criticized Sartre's lack of political commitment during the German occupation, and interpreted his further struggles for liberty as an attempt to redeem himself. According to Camus, Sartre was a writer who resisted; not a resister who wrote.

In 1945, after the war ended, Sartre moved to an apartment on the [[rue Bonaparte]] which was where he was to produce most of his subsequent work, and where he lived until 1962. It was from there that he helped establish a quarterly literary and political [[review]], ''[[Les Temps modernes]]'' (''Modern Times''), in part to popularize his thought.&lt;ref&gt;Ann Fulton, Apostles of Sartre: Existentialism in America, 1945–1963 (Evanston, IL: Northwestern University Press, 1999) 12.&lt;/ref&gt;  He ceased teaching and devoted his time to writing and political activism. He would draw on his war experiences for his great trilogy of novels, ''Les Chemins de la Liberté'' (''[[The Roads to Freedom]]'') (1945–1949).

===Cold War politics and anticolonialism===
[[File:Beauvoir Sartre - Che Guevara -1960 - Cuba.jpg|thumb|Jean-Paul Sartre (middle) and [[Simone de Beauvoir]] (left) meeting with [[Che Guevara]] (right) in Cuba, 1960]]
The first period of Sartre's career, defined in large part by ''Being and Nothingness'' (1943), gave way to a second period—when the world was perceived as split into communist and capitalist blocs—of highly publicized political involvement. Sartre tended to glorify the [[French Resistance|Resistance]] after the war as the uncompromising expression of morality in action, and recalled that the ''résistants'' were a "band of brothers" who had enjoyed "real freedom" in a way that did not exist before nor after the war.{{sfn|Bondy|1967|p=26}} Sartre was "merciless" in attacking anyone who had collaborated or remained passive during the German occupation; for instance, criticizing Camus for signing an appeal to spare the collaborationist writer [[Robert Brasillach]] from being executed.{{sfn|Bondy|1967|p=26}} His 1948 play ''Les mains sales'' (''[[Dirty Hands]]'') in particular explored the problem of being a politically "engaged"  intellectual. He embraced [[Marxism]] but did not join the [[French Communist Party|Communist Party]]. For a time in the late 1940s, Sartre described French nationalism as "provincial" and in a 1949 essay called for a "United States of Europe".{{sfn|Bondy|1967|p=29}} In an essay published in the June 1949 edition of the journal ''Politique étrangère'', Sartre wrote: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;If we want French civilization to survive, it must be fitted into the framework of a great European civilization. Why? I have said that civilization is the reflection on a shared situation. In Italy, in France, in Benelux, in Sweden, in Norway, in Germany, in Greece, in Austria, everywhere we find the same problems and the same dangers ... But this cultural polity has prospects only as elements of a policy which defends Europe's cultural autonomy vis-à-vis America and the Soviet Union, but also its political and economic autonomy, with the aim of making Europe a single force between the blocs, not a third bloc, but an autonomous force which will refuse to allow itself to be torn into shreds between American optimism and Russian scientificism.{{sfn|Bondy|1967|p=29-30}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

About the Korean War, Sartre wrote: "I have no doubt that the South Korean feudalists and the American imperialists have promoted this war. But I do not doubt either that it was begun by the North Koreans".{{sfn|Bondy|1967|p=34}} In July 1950, Sartre wrote in ''Les Temps Modernes'' about his and de Beauvoir's attitude to the Soviet Union:

&lt;blockquote&gt;As we were neither members of the [Communist] party nor its avowed sympathizers, it was not our duty to write about Soviet labor camps; we were free to remain aloof from the quarrel over the nature of this system, provided that no events of sociological significance had occurred.{{sfn|Bondy|1967|p=25}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Sartre held that the Soviet Union was a "revolutionary" state working for the betterment of humanity and could be criticized only for failing to live up to its own ideals, but that critics had to take in mind that the Soviet state needed to defend itself against a hostile world; by contrast Sartre held that the failures of "bourgeois" states were due to their innate shortcomings.{{sfn|Bondy|1967|p=26}} The Swiss journalist [[François Bondy]] wrote that, based on a reading of Sartre's numerous essays, speeches and interviews "a simple basic pattern never fails to emerge: social change must be comprehensive and revolutionary" and the parties that promote the revolutionary charges "may be criticized, but only by those who completely identify themselves with its purpose, its struggle and its road to power", deeming Sartre's position to be "existentialist".{{sfn|Bondy|1967|p=26}}

While a Marxist, Sartre attacked what he saw as abuses of freedom and human rights by the Soviet Union. In 1954, Sartre visited the Soviet Union, which he stated he found a "complete freedom of criticism" while condemning the United States for sinking into "prefascism".{{sfn|Bondy|1967|p=28}} Sartre wrote about those Soviet writers expelled from the Soviet Writers' Union "still had the opportunity of rehabilitating themselves by writing better books".{{sfn|Bondy|1967|p=41}} He was one of the first French journalists to expose the existence of the labor camps, and vehemently opposed the invasion of Hungary, Russian anti-Semitism, and the execution of dissidents. About the Hungarian revolt of 1956, Sartre wrote: "In spite of everything, the Rakosi regime stood for socialization. Only it did it badly and that is worse than not to do so at all".{{sfn|Bondy|1967|p=37}}  Sartre came to admire the Polish leader [[Władysław Gomułka]], a man who favored a "Polish road to socialism" and wanted more independence for Poland, but was loyal to the Soviet Union because of the Oder-Neisse line issue.{{sfn|Bondy|1967|p=38}} Sartre's newspaper ''Les Temps Modernes'' devoted a number of special issues in 1957 and 1958 to Poland under Gomułka, praising him for his reforms.{{sfn|Bondy|1967|p=38}} Bondy wrote of the notable contradiction between Sarte's "ultra Bolshevism" as he expressed admiration for the Chinese leader [[Mao Zedong]] as the man who lead the oppressed masses of the Third World into revolution while also praising more moderate Communist leaders like Gomułka.{{sfn|Bondy|1967|p=38}}

As an anti-colonialist, Sartre took a prominent role in the struggle against French rule in Algeria, and the use of torture and concentration camps by the French in Algeria. He became an eminent supporter of the [[National Liberation Front (Algeria)|FLN]] in the [[Algerian War]] and was one of the signatories of the ''[[Manifeste des 121]]''. Consequently, Sartre became a domestic target of the paramilitary [[Organisation armée secrète]] (OAS), escaping two bomb attacks in the early '60s.&lt;ref&gt;István Mészáros, ''The Work of Sartre: Search for Freedom and the Challenge of History,'' rev. ed. (New York: Monthly Review, 2012), p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; (He had an Algerian mistress, Arlette Elkaïm, who became his adopted daughter in 1965.) He opposed U.S. involvement in the [[Vietnam War]] and, along with [[Bertrand Russell]] and others, organized a [[tribunal]] intended to expose U.S. [[war crimes]], which became known as the [[Russell Tribunal]] in 1967.
[[File:Jean Paul Sartre by Gray.jpg|left|thumb|180px|Sketch of Sartre for the ''New York Times'' by [[Reginald Gray (artist)|Reginald Gray]], 1965]]

His work after Stalin's death, the ''Critique de la raison dialectique'' (''[[Critique of Dialectical Reason]]''), appeared in 1960 (a second volume appearing posthumously). In the ''Critique'' Sartre set out to give Marxism a more vigorous intellectual defense than it had received until then; he ended by concluding that Marx's notion of "class" as an objective entity was fallacious. Sartre's emphasis on the humanist values in the early works of Marx led to a dispute with a leading leftist intellectual in France in the 1960s, [[Louis Althusser]], who claimed that the ideas of the [[young Marx]] were decisively superseded by the "scientific" system of the later Marx. In the late 1950s, Sartre began to argue that the European working classes were too apolitical to carry out the revolution predicated by Marx, and influenced by [[Frantz Fanon]] stated to argue it was the impoverished masses of the Third World, the "real damned of the earth", who would carry out the revolution.{{sfn|Bondy|1967|p=27-28}} A major theme of Sarte's political essays in the 1960s was of his disgust with the "Americanization" of the French working class who would much rather watch American TV shows dubbed into French than agitate for a revolution.{{sfn|Bondy|1967|p=26}}

Sartre went to [[Cuba]] in the 1960s to meet [[Fidel Castro]] and spoke with [[Ernesto "Che" Guevara]]. After Guevara's death, Sartre would declare him to be "not only an intellectual but also the most complete human being of our age"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenews.com.pk/TodaysPrintDetail.aspx?ID=27548&amp;Cat=9&amp;dt=10/9/2006 |title="Remembering Che Guevara", 9 October 2006, '&amp;#39;The International News'&amp;#39;, by Prof Khwaja Masud |work=The News International |date=9 October 2006 |accessdate=27 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112210219/http://www.thenews.com.pk/TodaysPrintDetail.aspx?ID=27548&amp;Cat=9&amp;dt=10%2F9%2F2006 |archivedate=12 January 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the "era's most perfect man".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|isbn=1920888241 |title=Amazon Review of: 'The Bolivian Diary: Authorized Edition' |publisher=Amazon.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sartre would also compliment Guevara by professing that "he lived his words, spoke his own actions and his story and the story of the world ran parallel".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heyche.org/peopleaboutche.html HeyChe.org – People about Che Guevara]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080709042917/http://www.heyche.org/peopleaboutche.html |date=9 July 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However he stood against the persecution of gays by Castro's régime, which he compared to Nazi persecution of the Jews, and said: "In Cuba there are no Jews, but there are homosexuals".&lt;ref&gt;Conducta Impropria by [[Nestor Almendros]], 1983: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIQB5cI9b4A&amp;index=8&amp;list=PLD12AFBD33DDE5D99.&lt;/ref&gt;

During a collective hunger strike in 1974, Sartre visited [[Red Army Faction]] leader [[Andreas Baader]] in [[Stammheim Prison]] and criticized the harsh conditions of imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jean-Paul Sartre |url=http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/sartre/1974/baader.htm |title=The Slow Death of Andreas Baader |publisher=Marxists.org |date=7 December 1974 |accessdate=2 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Towards the end of his life, Sartre became an [[anarchism|anarchist]].&lt;ref name="nybooks4"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/1975/aug/07/sartre-at-seventy-an-interview/?page=4 |title=Sartre at Seventy: An Interview by Jean-Paul Sartre and Michel Contat |work=The New York Review of Books |date=7 August 1975 |accessdate=27 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="raforum1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://raforum.info/spip.php?article92 |title=R.A.

In 1964 Sartre renounced literature in a witty and sardonic account of the first ten years of his life, ''Les Mots'' (''[[The Words (book)|The Words]]''). The book is an ironic counterblast to [[Marcel Proust]], whose reputation had unexpectedly eclipsed that of [[André Gide]] (who had provided the model of ''littérature engagée'' for Sartre's generation). Literature, Sartre concluded, functioned ultimately as a bourgeois substitute for real commitment in the world. In October 1964, Sartre was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] but he declined it. He was the first Nobel laureate to voluntarily decline the prize,&lt;ref&gt;

Though his name was then a household word (as was "existentialism" during the tumultuous 1960s), Sartre remained a simple man with few possessions, actively committed to causes until the end of his life, such as the [[May 1968 in France|May 1968 strikes]] in Paris during the summer of 1968 during which he was arrested for [[civil disobedience]]. President [[Charles de Gaulle]] intervened and pardoned him, commenting that "you don't arrest [[Voltaire]]".&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE4DF1538F934A35755C0A961948260 "Superstar of the Mind"], by Tom Bishop in ''[[The New York Times]]'' 7 June 1987&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1975, when asked how he would like to be remembered, Sartre replied:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I would like &lt;nowiki&gt;[people]&lt;/nowiki&gt; to remember ''Nausea'', &lt;nowiki&gt;[my plays]&lt;/nowiki&gt; ''No Exit'' and ''The Devil and the Good Lord,'' and then my two philosophical works, more particularly the second one, ''[[Critique of Dialectical Reason]]''. Then my essay on [[Jean Genet|Genet]], ''Saint Genet''. ... If these are remembered, that would be quite an achievement, and I don't ask for more. As a man, if a certain Jean-Paul Sartre is remembered, I would like people to remember the milieu or historical situation in which I lived, ... how I lived in it, in terms of all the aspirations which I tried to gather up within myself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Charlesworth  |first=Max  |title=The Existentialists and Jean-Paul Sartre |year=1976 |publisher=University of Queensland Press |isbn=0-7022-1150-8 |page=154}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Sartre's physical condition deteriorated, partially because of the merciless pace of work (and the use of [[amphetamine]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New Criterion review of La Cérémonie des adieux by Simone de Beauvoir|url=http://www.newcriterion.com/articles.cfm/The-last-days-of-Jean-Paul-Sartre-6523}}&lt;/ref&gt; he put himself through during the writing of the ''Critique'' and a massive analytical biography of [[Gustave Flaubert]] (''The Family Idiot''), both of which remained unfinished. He suffered from hypertension,&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Hayman. ''Sartre: A Biography.'' Carroll &amp; Graf, 1992, p. 464.&lt;/ref&gt; and became almost completely blind in 1973. Sartre was a notorious [[chain smoker]], which could also have contributed to the deterioration of his health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Samuel|first=Henry|title=Hell is other people removing your cigarette|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/1485353/Hell-is-other-people-removing-your-cigarette.html|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=10 March 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sartre died on 15 April 1980 in Paris from [[edema]] of the lung. He had not wanted to be buried at [[Père-Lachaise Cemetery]] between his mother and stepfather, so it was arranged that he be buried at [[Montparnasse Cemetery]]. At his funeral on Saturday, 19 April, 50,000 Parisians descended onto Boulevard Montparnasse to accompany Sartre's cortege.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Histoire Du Monde|url=http://www.histoiredumonde.net/Jean-Paul-Sartre.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nat-2000-Singer"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenation.com/doc/20000605/singer/single |archive-url=https://archive.is/20080602061137/http://www.thenation.com/doc/20000605/singer/single |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2 June 2008 |title=Sartre's Roads to Freedom |last=Singer |first=Daniel |date=5 June 2000 |work=The Nation |accessdate=9 May 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The funeral started at "the hospital at 2:00 p.m., then filed through the fourteenth arrondissement, past all Sartre's haunts, and entered the cemetery through the gate on the Boulevard Edgar Quinet". Sartre was initially buried in a temporary grave to the left of the cemetery gate.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen-Solal, Annie. ''Sartre: A Life.'' Random House, Inc., 1987, p. 523.&lt;/ref&gt; Four days later the body was disinterred for cremation at Père-Lachaise Cemetery, and his ashes were reburied at the permanent site in Montparnasse Cemetery, to the right of the cemetery gate.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen-Solal, Annie, p. 523.

==Thought==
{{See also|Being and Nothingness}}
Sartre's primary idea is that people, as humans, are "condemned to be free".&lt;ref name="Existentialism and Humanism"&gt;''Existentialism and Humanism''&lt;/ref&gt; This theory relies upon his position that there is no creator, and is illustrated using the example of the [[paper cutter]]. Sartre says that if one considered a paper cutter, one would assume that the creator would have had a plan for it: an essence. Sartre said that human beings have no essence before their existence because there is no Creator. Thus: "existence precedes essence".&lt;ref name="Existentialism and Humanism"/&gt; This forms the basis for his assertion that because one cannot explain one's own actions and behavior by referring to any specific human nature, they are necessarily fully responsible for those actions. "We are left alone, without excuse." "We can act without being determined by our past which is always separated from us."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/8181406/Does_our_past_have_a_motivational_effect_Our_reasons_for_acting_Sartre_s_philosophy_of_action |title=Does our past have a motivational effect? Our reasons for acting: Sartre's philosophy of action. |author=[[Yoann Malinge]] |date= |website=[[Academia.edu]] |access-date=25 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sartre maintained that the concepts of authenticity and individuality have to be earned but not learned. We need to experience "death consciousness" so as to wake up ourselves as to what is really important; the authentic in our lives which is life experience, not knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Being and Nothingness, p. 246&lt;/ref&gt; Death draws the final point when we as beings cease to live for ourselves and permanently become objects that exist only for the outside world.&lt;ref&gt;Death. (1999). In Gordon Hayim (Ed.) Dictionary of Existentialism (p. 105). Westport, CT: Greenwood Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In this way death emphasizes the burden of our free, individual existence.

As a junior lecturer at the Lycée du [[Le Havre|Havre]] in 1938, Sartre wrote the novel ''[[Nausea (novel)|La Nausée]]'' (''Nausea''), which serves in some ways as a [[manifesto]] of [[existentialism]] and remains one of his most famous books. Taking a page from the [[Husserl|German]] [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenological]] movement, he believed that our ideas are the product of experiences of real-life situations, and that novels and plays can well describe such fundamental experiences, having equal value to discursive essays for the elaboration of philosophical theories such as existentialism. With such purpose, this novel concerns a dejected researcher (Roquentin) in a town similar to Le Havre who becomes starkly conscious of the fact that inanimate objects and situations remain absolutely indifferent to his existence. As such, they show themselves to be resistant to whatever significance human consciousness might perceive in them.

He also took inspiration from phenomenologist epistemology, explained by Franz Adler in this way: "Man chooses and makes himself by acting. Any action implies the judgment that he is right under the circumstances not only for the actor, but also for everybody else in similar circumstances."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = The Social Thought of Jean-Paul Sartre | journal = American Journal of Sociology | first = Franz | last = Adler | volume = 55 | issue = 3&lt;!--|accessdate=16 May 2013--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This indifference of "things in themselves" (closely linked with the later notion of "being-in-itself" in his ''[[Being and Nothingness]]'') has the effect of highlighting all the more the freedom Roquentin has to perceive and act in the world; everywhere he looks, he finds situations imbued with meanings which bear the stamp of his existence. Hence the "nausea" referred to in the title of the book; all that he encounters in his everyday life is suffused with a pervasive, even horrible, taste—specifically, his freedom. The book takes the term from [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]'s ''[[Thus Spoke Zarathustra]]'', where it is used in the context of the often nauseating quality of existence. No matter how much Roquentin longs for something else or something different, he cannot get away from this harrowing evidence of his engagement with the world.

The novel also acts as a terrifying realization of some of [[Immanuel Kant]]'s fundamental ideas about freedom; Sartre uses the idea of the autonomy of the will (that [[morality]] is derived from our ability to choose in reality; the ability to choose being derived from human freedom; embodied in the famous saying "Condemned to be free") as a way to show the world's indifference to the individual. The freedom that Kant exposed is here a strong burden, for the freedom to act towards objects is ultimately useless, and the practical application of Kant's ideas proves to be bitterly rejected.

Also important is Sartre's analysis of psychological concepts, including his suggestion that consciousness exists as something other than itself, and that the conscious awareness of things is not limited to their knowledge: for Sartre intentionality applies to the emotions as well as to cognitions, to desires as well as to perceptions.&lt;ref&gt;Farina, Gabriella (2014). [http://www.crossingdialogues.com/Ms-A14-07.pdf Some reflections on the phenomenological method.] ''Dialogues in Philosophy, Mental and Neuro Sciences'', '''7'''(2):50–62.&lt;/ref&gt; "When an external object is perceived, consciousness is also conscious of itself, even if consciousness is not its own object: it is a non-positional consciousness of itself."&lt;ref&gt;Yoann Malinge, ''"Sartre, « The Transcendance of the Ego »"'' (The Literary Encyclopedia: https://www.academia.edu/31648622/_Sartre_The_Transcendance_of_the_Ego_article_in_The_Literary_Encyclopedia_&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career as public intellectual==
[[File:Sartre and de Beauvoir at Balzac Memorial.jpg|thumb|upright|Jean-Paul Sartre and [[Simone de Beauvoir]] at the [[Honoré de Balzac|Balzac]] Memorial]]
While the broad focus of Sartre's life revolved around the notion of human freedom, he began a sustained intellectual participation in more public matters towards the end of the Second World War, around 1944-45.&lt;ref&gt;Baert 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Before World War II, he was content with the role of an apolitical liberal intellectual: "Now teaching at a lycée in Laon ... Sartre made his headquarters the Dome café at the crossing of Montparnasse and Raspail boulevards. He attended plays, read novels, and dined &lt;nowiki&gt;[with]&lt;/nowiki&gt; women. He wrote. And he was published."&lt;ref&gt;Gerassi 1989: 134&lt;/ref&gt; Sartre and his lifelong companion, de Beauvoir, existed, in her words, where "the world about us was a mere backdrop against which our private lives were played out".&lt;ref&gt;de Beauvoir 1958: 339&lt;/ref&gt;

Sartre portrayed his own pre-war situation in the character Mathieu, chief protagonist in ''[[The Age of Reason (Sartre)|The Age of Reason]]'', which was completed during Sartre's first year as a soldier in the Second World War. By forging Mathieu as an absolute [[rationalist]], analyzing every situation, and functioning entirely on reason, he removed any strands of authentic content from his character and as a result, Mathieu could "recognize no allegiance except to [him]self",&lt;ref&gt;Sartre 1942: 13&lt;/ref&gt; though he realized that without "responsibility for my own existence, it would seem utterly absurd to go on existing".&lt;ref&gt;Sartre 1942: 14&lt;/ref&gt; Mathieu's commitment was only to himself, never to the outside world. Mathieu was restrained from action each time because he had no reasons for acting. Sartre then, for these reasons, was not compelled to participate in the [[Spanish Civil War]], and it took the invasion of his own country to motivate him into action and to provide a crystallization of these ideas. It was the war that gave him a purpose beyond himself, and the atrocities of the war can be seen as the turning point in his public stance.

The war opened Sartre's eyes to a political reality he had not yet understood until forced into continual engagement with it: "the world itself destroyed Sartre's illusions about isolated self-determining individuals and made clear his own personal stake in the events of the time."&lt;ref&gt;Aronson 1980: 108&lt;/ref&gt; Returning to Paris in 1941 he formed the "Socialisme et Liberté" resistance group. In 1943, after the group disbanded, Sartre joined a writers' Resistance group,&lt;ref&gt;Aronson, Ronald (2004). ''Camus &amp; Sartre: The Story of a Friendship and the Quarrel That Ended It''. University of Chicago Press. p. 30. {{ISBN|0-226-02796-1}}, {{ISBN|978-0-226-02796-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; in which he remained an active participant until the end of the war. He continued to write ferociously, and it was due to this "crucial experience of war and captivity that Sartre began to try to build up a positive moral system and to express it through literature".&lt;ref&gt;Thody 1964: 21&lt;/ref&gt;

The symbolic initiation of this new phase in Sartre's work is packaged in the introduction he wrote for a new journal, ''[[Les Temps modernes]]'', in October 1945. Here he aligned the journal, and thus himself, with the Left and called for writers to express their political commitment.&lt;ref&gt;Aronson 1980: 10&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, this alignment was indefinite, directed more to the concept of the Left than a specific party of the Left.

Sartre's philosophy lent itself to his being a [[public intellectual]]. He envisaged culture as a very fluid concept; neither pre-determined, nor definitely finished; instead, in true [[existentialism|existential]] fashion, "culture was always conceived as a process of continual invention and re-invention." This marks Sartre, the intellectual, as a [[pragmatism|pragmatist]], willing to move and shift stance along with events. He did not dogmatically follow a cause other than the belief in [[liberty|human freedom]], preferring to retain a pacifist's objectivity. It is this overarching theme of freedom that means his work "subverts the bases for distinctions among the disciplines".&lt;ref&gt;Kirsner 2003: 13&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, he was able to hold knowledge across a vast array of subjects: "the international world order, the political and economic organisation of contemporary society, especially France, the institutional and legal frameworks that regulate the lives of ordinary citizens, the educational system, the media networks that control and disseminate information. Sartre systematically refused to keep quiet about what he saw as inequalities and injustices in the world."&lt;ref&gt;Scriven 1999: xii&lt;/ref&gt;

Sartre always sympathized with the Left, and supported the [[French Communist Party]] (PCF) until the 1956 Soviet invasion of Hungary. Following the [[Liberation of France|Liberation]] the PCF were infuriated by Sartre's philosophy, which appeared to lure young French men and women away from the ideology of communism and into Sartre's own existentialism.&lt;ref&gt;Scriven 1999: 13&lt;/ref&gt; From 1956 onwards Sartre rejected the claims of the PCF to represent the French working classes, objecting to its "authoritarian tendencies". In the late 1960s Sartre supported the [[Maoism|Maoists]], a movement that rejected the authority of established communist parties.&lt;ref name="SEP"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/sartre/ |title=Jean-Paul Sartre |work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=27 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, despite aligning with the Maoists, Sartre said after the May events: "If one rereads all my books, one will realize that I have not changed profoundly, and that I have always remained an anarchist."&lt;ref name="nybooks4"/&gt; He would later explicitly allow himself to be called an anarchist.&lt;ref name="raforum1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated21"/&gt;

In the aftermath of a war that had for the first time properly engaged Sartre in political matters, he set forth a body of work which "reflected on virtually every important theme of his early thought and began to explore alternative solutions to the problems posed there".&lt;ref&gt;Aronson 1980: 121&lt;/ref&gt; The greatest difficulties that he and all public intellectuals of the time faced were the increasing technological aspects of the world that were outdating the printed word as a form of expression. In Sartre's opinion, the "traditional bourgeois literary forms remain innately superior", but there is "a recognition that the new technological 'mass media' forms must be embraced" if Sartre's ethical and political goals as an authentic, committed intellectual are to be achieved: the demystification of [[bourgeois]] political practices and the raising of the consciousness, both political and cultural, of the working class.&lt;ref&gt;Scriven 1993: 8&lt;/ref&gt;

The struggle for Sartre was against the monopolising moguls who were beginning to take over the media and destroy the role of the intellectual. His attempts to reach a public were mediated by these powers, and it was often these powers he had to campaign against. He was skilled enough, however, to circumvent some of these issues by his interactive approach to the various forms of media, advertising his radio interviews in a newspaper column for example, and vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;Scriven 1993: 22&lt;/ref&gt;

The role of a public intellectual can lead to the individual placing himself in danger as he engages with disputed topics. In Sartre's case, this was witnessed in June 1961, when a plastic bomb exploded in the entrance of his apartment building. His public support of Algerian [[self-determination]] at the time had led Sartre to become a target of the campaign of terror that mounted as the colonists' position deteriorated. A similar occurrence took place the next year and he had begun to receive threatening letters from [[Oran|Oran, Algeria]].&lt;ref&gt;Aronson 1980: 157&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literature==
{{expand section|date=July 2018}}
Sartre wrote successfully in a number of literary modes and made major contributions to literary criticism and literary biography. His plays are richly symbolic and serve as a means of conveying his philosophy. The best-known, ''Huis-clos'' (''[[No Exit]]''), contains the famous line "L'enfer, c'est les autres", usually translated as "Hell is other people."&lt;ref name="rickontheater"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rickontheater.blogspot.com/2010/07/most-famous-thing-jean-paul-sartre.html |title= The Most Famous Thing Jean-Paul Sartre Never Said |last1=Woodward |first1=Kirk|date=9 July 2010 |work=Rick on Theater |publisher=Blogger (Google: blogspot.com) |accessdate=8 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aside from the impact of ''Nausea'', Sartre's major work of fiction was ''[[The Roads to Freedom]]'' trilogy which charts the progression of how World War II affected Sartre's ideas. In this way, ''Roads to Freedom'' presents a less theoretical and more practical approach to [[existentialism]].

[[John Huston]] got Sartre to script his film ''[[Freud: The Secret Passion]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Sartre, ''Le Scénario'', 10; Scenario. viii.&lt;/ref&gt; However it was too long and Sartre withdrew his name from the film's credits.&lt;ref name="Roudinesco"&gt;Roudinesco, Elisabeth. ''Jacques Lacan &amp; Co: A History of Psychoanalysis in France, 1925–1985''. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1990, p. 166&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, many key elements from Sartre's script survive in the finished film.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.asharperfocus.com/Freud.html&lt;/ref&gt;
Despite their similarities as polemicists, novelists, adapters, and playwrights, Sartre's literary work has been counterposed, often pejoratively, to that of Camus in the popular imagination. In 1948 the [[Roman Catholic Church]] placed Sartre's oeuvre on the [[Index Librorum Prohibitorum|''Index Librorum Prohibitorum'' (List of Prohibited Books)]].

==Criticism==
Some philosophers argue that Sartre's thought is contradictory. Specifically, they believe that Sartre makes metaphysical arguments despite his claim that his philosophical views ignore metaphysics. [[Herbert Marcuse]] criticized ''[[Being and Nothingness]]'' for projecting anxiety and meaninglessness onto the nature of existence itself: "Insofar as Existentialism is a philosophical doctrine, it remains an idealistic doctrine: it [[Reification (fallacy)|hypostatizes]] specific historical conditions of human existence into ontological and metaphysical characteristics. Existentialism thus becomes part of the very ideology which it attacks, and its radicalism is illusory."&lt;ref&gt;Marcuse, Herbert. "Sartre's Existentialism". Printed in ''Studies in Critical Philosophy''. Translated by Joris De Bres. London: NLB, 1972. p. 161&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Letter on Humanism]]'', Heidegger criticized Sartre's existentialism:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Existentialism says existence precedes essence. In this statement he is taking ''existentia'' and ''essentia'' according to their metaphysical meaning, which, from Plato's time on, has said that ''essentia'' precedes ''existentia''. Sartre reverses this statement. But the reversal of a metaphysical statement remains a metaphysical statement. With it, he stays with metaphysics, in oblivion of the truth of Being.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Heidegger, "Letter on Humanism", in ''Basic Writings: Nine Key Essays, plus the Introduction to ''Being and Time'' '', trans. David Farrell Krell (London, Routledge; 1978), 208. [https://books.google.com/books?id=kVc9AAAAIAAJ&amp;lpg=PA208 Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The philosophers [[Richard Wollheim]] and [[Thomas Baldwin (philosopher)|Thomas Baldwin]] have argued that Sartre's attempt to show that [[Sigmund Freud]]'s theory of the unconscious is mistaken was based on a misinterpretation of Freud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Thomas Baldwin |editor=Ted Honderich |title=The Oxford Companion to Philosophy |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |year=1995 |page=792 |isbn=0-19-866132-0 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wollheim, Richard. ''Freud''. London, Fontana Press, pp. 157–176&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Webster (British author)|Richard Webster]] considers Sartre one of many modern thinkers who have reconstructed Judaeo-Christian orthodoxies in secular form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Webster, Richard |title=Why Freud Was Wrong: Sin, Science and Psychoanalysis |publisher=The Orwell Press |location=Oxford |year=2005 |page=7 |isbn=0-9515922-5-4 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Intellectuals associated with the political [[Right-wing politics|right]] allege that Sartre's politics are indicative of [[authoritarianism]]. [[Brian C. Anderson]] denounced Sartre as an apologist for tyranny and terror and a supporter of [[Stalinism]], [[Maoism]], and Castro's regime in [[Cuba]].&lt;ref name="Anderson" /&gt; The historian [[Paul Johnson (writer)|Paul Johnson]] asserted that Sartre's ideas had inspired the [[Khmer Rouge]] leadership:  "The events in Cambodia in the 1970s, in which between one-fifth and one-third of the nation was starved to death or murdered, were entirely the work of a group of intellectuals, who were for the most part pupils and admirers of Jean-Paul Sartre – 'Sartre's Children' as I call them."&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Paul, "[http://www.fortfreedom.org/h11.htm The Heartless Lovers of Humankind]", ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', 5 January 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sartre, who stated in his preface to [[Frantz Fanon]]'s ''[[The Wretched of the Earth]]'' that, "To shoot down a European is to kill two birds with one stone, to destroy an oppressor and the man he oppresses at the same time: there remains a dead man and a free man," has been criticized by Anderson and [[Michael Walzer]] for supporting the killing of European civilians by the [[National Liberation Front (Algeria)|FLN]] during the [[Algerian War]]. Walzer suggests that Sartre, a European, was a hypocrite for not volunteering to be killed.&lt;ref name="Anderson"&gt;[http://www.hoover.org/publications/policy-review/article/6476 The Absolute Intellectual] Brian C. Anderson&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dissentmagazine.org/article/?article=598 Can There Be a Decent Left?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111118221640/http://www.dissentmagazine.org/article/?article=598 |date=18 November 2011 }} {{website=Kenyon.edu |url=http://www2.kenyon.edu/Depts/Religion/Fac/Adler/Politics/Waltzer.htm |date=18 November 2011 }} Michael Walzer&lt;/ref&gt;

The critic, poet, essayist and philosopher [[Clive James]] excoriated Sartre in his book of mini biographies ''[[Cultural Amnesia (book)|Cultural Amnesia]]'' (2007). James attacks Sartre's philosophy as being "all a pose".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/clives_lives/2007/03/jeanpaul_sartre.html|title=Jean-Paul Sartre|first=Clive|last=James|date=29 March 2007|publisher=|accessdate=16 August 2016|via=Slate}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Karmic Debts" is a 2013 [[novel]], the eight book by the [[Estonia]]n author Inga Raitar.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2017-06-21|title=Inga Raitar|url=https://et.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Inga_Raitar&amp;oldid=4676793|journal=Vikipeedia, vaba entsüklopeedia|language=et}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It consists of three entwined stories that takes the readers to a journey from a secluded [[Tibetan people|Tibetan Monastery]] in the 16th century, through the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Famine]] in the 1800s, all the way to present day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://legend.eu/toode/karmavolad/|title=Karmavõlad - Kirjastus Legend|work=Kirjastus Legend|access-date=2017-07-28|language=et-EE}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Karma|karmic]] threads start to twist and intertwine between the stories leaving you questioning - why does the fateful karma interfere with our lives and how far does it reach? How do we end up in the relationships that we have? What is the thing bringing them forward?

The book was translated to English in 2017, and can be found as a [[Kindle Store|Kindle e-book]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Karmic-Debts-Three-lives-destinies-ebook/dp/B0748LDBFQ/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1501233394&amp;sr=1-1|title=Karmic Debts: Three lives. Three destinies. Three eras.|last=Raitar|first=Inga|date=2017-07-25|publisher=Legend Kirjastus|edition=1|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview and linking themes ==
It would appear as if there are three distinct tales unraveling in this novel – one taking place long ago in a Tibetan monastery, another during the Great Famine in Ireland and the third somewhere in the present day. The book is presented by the main characters point of view and the stories are linked to one another in a way that makes it seem, as if time does not flow in a linear way.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://poltsamaaraamat.blogspot.com/2013/12/karmavolad.html|title=Põltsamaa Raamatukogu|last=nurmek|first=Postitaja:|access-date=2017-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In each story, the characters are looking for answers to questions about real love, and how or why does it come to our life? Why do you feel at times that you have known certain people for a lifetime before you even really meet? .

The [[book]] was originally published as a series of short-stories in the Estonian biggest [[List of women's magazines|women's magazine]] "Naised", but it was never finished. The author wanted to add an extra dimension to the story and stopped writing to the magazine each month.

Karmic Debts" is a romantic [[Romance novel|love story]] and, at the same time, an exciting [[Fantasy|fantasy tale]] about the mysterious strings of karma that are hidden behind all of our relationships.

== Plot ==
Iris, a young and successful woman, meets a stranger on a business trip, who is far from her “type”. Nonetheless, a spark ignites that turns her life as she knows it, upside down.

The beautiful bastard daughter of an Irish lord, Irene, falls in love with a poor farmers boy. This will determine the life of the whole village and set her fate.

A devotee named Ikaro bears witness to his best friend’s foul secret. The boy must choose, whether to betray everything he believes holy or acknowledge what he truly wants.

&lt;!-- no infobox, please --&gt;
'''''Kasumi-ori Musume Hinagata''''' ({{lang|ja|霞織娘雛形}}, "Model Young Women in Mist") is a print series by the Japanese [[ukiyo-e]] artist [[Kitagawa Utamaro]].  The theme is of beautiful women seen through different woven materials.  Three prints from the series are known; whether there were more is unknown.

==Background==

[[Ukiyo-e]] art flourished in Japan during the [[Edo period]] from the 17th to 19th centuries, and took as its primary subjects [[oiran|courtesans]], [[kabuki]] actors, and others associated with the "floating world" lifestyle of the [[Yūkaku|pleasure districts]].  Alongside paintings, mass-produced [[Woodblock printing|woodblock prints]] were a major form of the genre.{{sfn|Fitzhugh|1979|p=27}}  In the mid-18th century full-colour ''{{transl|ja|[[nishiki-e]]}}'' prints became common, printed using a large number of woodblocks, one for each colour.{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|pp=80–83}}  A prominent genre was ''{{transl|ja|[[bijin-ga]]}}'' ("pictures of beauties"), which depicted most often [[Oiran|courtesans]] and [[geisha]] at leisure, and promoted the entertainments of the pleasure districts.{{sfn|Harris|2011|p=60}}

[[Kitagawa Utamaro]] ({{circa|1753}}–1806) made his name in the 1790s with his ''bijin [[ōkubi-e]]'' ("large-headed pictures of beautiful women") portraits, focusing on the head and upper torso, a style others had previously employed in portraits of kabuki actors.{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|pp=87–88}}  Utamaro experimented with line, colour, and printing techniques to bring out subtle differences in the features, expressions, and backdrops of subjects from a wide variety of class and background.  Utamaro's individuated beauties were in sharp contrast to the stereotyped, idealized images that had been the norm.{{sfn|Kobayashi|1997|p=88}}

{{clear}}

==Publication==

The series was published in {{circa|1794–95}} by [[Tsutaya Jūzaburō]].  It is not known how many were in the series; three are known, of which very few copies are known.{{sfn|Fujimura|2016|p=29}}  The bear the seal ''Utamaro hitsu'' ({{lang|ja|歌麿筆}}, "the brush of Utamaro").{{sfn|Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, staff}}&lt;!-- and Tsutaya's publishing mark --&gt;

The series theme is of beautiful women seen through translucent woven materials.{{sfn|Fujimura|2016|p=29}}  Two women appear in each print, one in front and one behind and seen through the translucent materials.{{sfn|Yamaguchi|1991|p=85}} ''Kasumi-ori'' ({{lang|ja|霞織}}, "mist-woven") is a [[neologism]] Utamaro uses to refer to materials woven so that they can be seen through unclearly, as in a mist.{{sfn|Kobayashi|2006|p=45}}  The translucent effect in the prints required the highest level of skill from their carvers{{sfn|Kobayashi|2006|p=45}} and careful moderation of the ''[[Baren (printing tool)|baren]]'' burnishing tool by the printers.{{sfn|Fujimura|2016|p=31}}

===''Kachō''===

[[File:Utamaro (c. 1794–95) Kasumi-ori Musume Hinagata - Kachō (AIC).jpg|thumb|upright|alt=]]

In ''Kachō'' ({{lang|ja|蚊帳}}, "Mosquito net", the same characters also pronounced ''kaya''), a woman peers through a light yellowish-green{{efn|Such nets came in light yellowish green or in white.{{sfn|Yamaguchi|1991|p=142}} }} [[mosquito net]] of thin silk gauze, an item of great luxury at the time; commoners made such nets of hemp or cotton.  The woman wears a in a ''{{illm|narumi shibori|ja|有松・鳴海絞り}}'' [[tie-dye]]d komono patterned with scattered circles.  From above hang two ''[[hoso-obi]]'' sashes, one red and the other violet.{{sfn|Yamaguchi|1991|p=142}}  This is the only print in the series in which the woman face each other;{{sfn|Yamaguchi|1991|p=142}} they appear to be in conversation.{{sfn|Yamaguchi|1991|p=142}}

===''Sudare''===

[[File:Utamaro (c. 1794–95) Kasumi-ori Musume Hinagata - Sudare (MFA).jpg|thumb|upright|alt=]]

In ''Sudare'' ({{lang|ja|簾}}, "Reed screen"),  woman dressed as a daughter of a high-ranking [[samurai]] family sits behind a luxurious ''[[sudare]]'' reed screen hemmed with a flower pattern.  The woman who stands in front of the screen wears her hair in a {{illm|shiitake-tabo|ja|椎茸髱|lt=''shiitake-tabo''}}, a hairstyle asocciated with the women-in-waiting at high-ranked samurai homes.  Utamaro has posed the women so their hairstyles contrast—the woman behind the screen's is extravagantly tied and decorated, while the woman-in waiting's is much simpler.  The both have pleased, attentive expressions, and appear to be watching something—perhaps a show or presentation.{{sfn|Fujimura|2016|p=29}}

The collectors William&amp;nbsp;S. and John&amp;nbsp;T. Spaulding bought a copy of this print from the architect [[Frank Lloyd Wright]] while in Japan in 1913.{{sfn|Fujimura|2016|p=29}}  The Spaulding brothers donated their copy along with the rest of their collection to the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]] on 21 December 1921.{{sfn|Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, staff}}

===''Natsu Ishō''===

&lt;!-- [[File:|thumb|upright|alt=|]]
--&gt;
In ''Natsu Ishō'' ({{lang|ja|夏衣装}}, "Summer clothing"), an elegantly-dressed woman standing in the foreground holds a ''[[kanzashi]]'' hairpin with her right hand to her hair,{{sfn|Kobayashi|2006|p=45}} which is made up in a {{illm|Baimage|ja|貝髷|lt=''baimage''}} hairstyle.  She appears to have just gotten out of the bath.{{sfn|Fujimura|2016|p=31}}  Another young woman looks at her from behind a translucent cloth{{sfn|Kobayashi|2006|p=45}} hung on a clothes rack.  The pair appear to be in conversation.{{sfn|Fujimura|2016|p=31}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2840">'''Light Motion Dance Company''' is a two-woman integrated dance company based in [[Seattle]], combining a wheelchair dancer and an able-bodied dancer in performances.

==Overview==
Light Motion Dance Company was founded in 1988. The creative forces behind the company are Charlene Curtiss and Joanne Petroff. Performances feature both choreography and improvised dance. Light Motion Dance tours throughout the United States and internationally.&lt;ref name="NADC"&gt;{{cite web|title=Light Motion Dance Company|url=http://www.semel.ucla.edu/nadc/support-resource/light-motion-dance-company|publisher=National Arts and Disability Center, University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA)|accessdate=July 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Workshops for school children and adults are also part of Light Motion Dance's initiatives.&lt;ref name="NWRSCIS"&gt;{{cite web|title=Spinal Cord Injury Update (Fall 1997): Dancing on Wheels|url=http://sci.washington.edu/info/newsletters/articles/97f_dancing_on_wheels.asp|publisher=Northwest Regional Spinal Cord Injury System|accessdate=July 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Performances feature the choreography of Curtiss, who developed "front-end" wheelchair manoeuvers through her own experimentation and practise. Performances have been described as "virtuosic".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Albright|first=Ann Cooper|title=Choreographing Difference: The Body and Identity in Contemporary Dance|year=1997|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|isbn=9780819563156|pages=76}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Charlene Curtiss began using a wheelchair after a gymnastics accident resulted in her becoming paraplegic at age 17 (Curtiss has T12 paraplegia). She became a lawyer, but her interest in wheelchair dance led to her leaving law, and forming the Light Motion Dance Company. In 1990, Curtiss added able-bodied dancer Joanne Petroff to the company. Curtiss has several years' experience as a college-level competitive swimmer, and as a wheelchair athlete in track and field competitions. She also occasionally delivers training in wheelchair aerobics and front-end chair control techniques to inpatients and outpatients at the [[University of Washington Medical Center]].&lt;ref name="NWRSCIS"/&gt;

In addition to performance work, Light Motion Dance Company has helped in the establishment of other integrated dance companies in the United States and around the world.&lt;ref name="NADC"/&gt;

{{notability|Organizations|date=June 2014}}

The '''Logos Foundation''' is a professional artistic organisation founded in 1968. It focuses on the promotion of [[Contemporary classical music|new music]]s and audio related arts by means of new music production, concerts, performances, composition, technological research projects and other contemporary music related activities.

The Logos Foundation (and its concert hall, the [[Logos Tetrahedron]]) is based in [[Ghent]], [[Belgium]] ([[Flanders]] region).

[[Godfried-Willem Raes]] is the founder and major driving force behind the Logos Foundation.

Since the last decades of the 20th century the Logos Foundation encourages publication of music in a [[copyright-free]] format.&lt;ref name="copyright"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.logosfoundation.org/copyleft/copyrigh.html |title=The Absurdity of Copyright}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Logos Tetrahedron==
The ''Logos Tetrahedron'' is a concert hall in [[Ghent, Belgium]] adjacent to the foundation's recording studio and offices.  It has seating for 150 people and is equipped with sound and light infrastructure.  Since the concert hall is in the shape of a [[tetrahedron]], it has no straight angles and, as a result, no standing waves can occur.  Acoustic waves can never amplify one another in phase and are reflected by the walls under ever changing angles.

The hall is exclusively used for contemporary and experimental music, such as [[electronic music]] and [[computer music]] and holds approximately 65 concerts a year, primarily by the Logos Foundation. In 2012 they were host for the [[ISCM World Music Days]] &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iscm.org/activities/wmds/reports/report-iscm-world-music-days-2012-belgium-john-mclachlan |title=ISCM World Music Days 2012 in Belgium}}&lt;/ref&gt;
.

The concert hall was built in 1990 by [[Godfried-Willem Raes]] and the Logos workgroup using steel, concrete and plate-metal.  Construction took one year. The hall was opened in 1991 with a three-day festival.

==M&amp;M robot orchestra==
Logos houses the innovative music ensemble M&amp;M robot orchestra (man and machine).  All kinds of musical interfaces (wireless gesture control, real time sound analysis, microwave radar, acceleration sensors, pyrodetectors, lightsensors, myoelectric devices, brainwaves, EEG and ECG and so on) are combined with the results of experimental [[robot]] design. Collaborative concerts are organised involving interactive robots and musicians.
They made a ''[http://logosfoundation.org/instrum_gwr/manual.html manual]'' for composers who would like to write for this orchestra.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://designingsound.org/2016/05/news-aos-presents-dr-godfried-willem-raes-and-his-robot-orchestra/ |title=AOS Presents: Dr. Godfried-Willem Raes and His Robot Orchestra}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://architectofsound.wordpress.com/2016/03/08/aos-presents-dr-godfried-willem-raes-professor-composer-music-maker-and-president-of-the-logos-foundation-and-general-director-of-the-logos-mm-ensemble/ |title=AOS Presents: Dr. Godfried-Willem Raes – Professor, Composer, music maker and President of the Logos Foundation and general director of the Logos M&amp;M ensemble}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.flandersmusic.be/identity.php?ID=138399 |title=Kunstenpunt / Flanders Arts Institute &lt;M&amp;M&gt; Orchestra}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.flanderstoday.eu/living/orchestrations |title=flanderstoday}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Musical fiction''' is a genre of fiction in which music is paramount: both as subject matter, and through the rhythm and flow of the prose; that is, music is manifested through the language itself. 

Notable authors who have written novels of musical fiction include [[Don DeLillo]] (''Great Jones Street''), [[Tom Perotta]] (''The Wishbones''), [[Lewis Shiner]] (''Glimpses''), [[Roddy Doyle]] (''The Commitments''), [[Robert Dunn (novelist)|Robert Dunn]] (''Pink Cadillac''), [[Nick Hornby]] (''High Fidelity''), [[Ibi Kaslik]] (''The Angel Riots''), [[Scott Spencer (author)|Scott Spencer]] (''The Rich Man's Table''), Brian Paone (''Yours Truly, 2095''), and Randy Blazak (''The Mission of the Sacred Heart'').

==Description==
In her anthology The Best of Rock Fiction, editor June Skinner Sawyers writes, “Rock fiction has not received the proper respect it deserves, which is unfortunate given the caliber of writers who have captured its fleeting essence on the written page.”&lt;ref&gt;Sawyers, June Skinner (Ed.) (2005). ''The Best in Rock Fiction.'' Milwaukee: Hal Leonard, p. vii.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the same anthology, Rolling Stone writer Anthony DeCurtis talks about “the edgy relationship” between music and the written word. “Words are long-standing symbols of permanence. Music ultimately is ephemeral, evaporating into your unreliable memory once you’ve heard it. In taking music as their inspiration, writers seek to capture some of that immediacy, that spirit of the moment, and hold it still for their reader’s pleasure.”&lt;ref&gt;Sawyers, June Skinner (Ed.) (2005). ''The Best in Rock Fiction.'' Milwaukee: Hal Leonard, pp. xii-xiv.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Shams Palace''' ({{lang-fa|کاخ شمس (کاخ مروارید کنونی)}}; [[Romanize]]d as ''kakh-e Shams/ Kāx-e Šams'' , also known as ''kakh-e Morvarid/ Kāx-e Morvārid'' ) is a large estate designed by [[Taliesin Associated Architects]] on instructions from princess [[Shams Pahlavi]], elder sister of [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]], the last Shah of Iran. It was built in the early 1970s and it is located in [[Mehrshahr]] near [[Karaj]], [[Iran]].{{cn|date=April 2018}}

==Background==
The majority of the complex is currently occupied by a local [[Baseej]] chapter who are neglecting its upkeep. Small parts are open to the public as a result of pressure from the [[Cultural Heritage Organization of Iran]].{{cn|date=April 2018}}

The building was recognized as a cultural value only in 2002, and registered by the [[Cultural Heritage Organization of Iran]]. It is currently in need of massive repairs.{{cn|date=April 2018}}

'''Preppy''' (also spelled '''preppie''') or '''prep''' (all abbreviations of the word ''preparatory'') refers to a  [[subculture]] in the [[United States]] associated with old [[private education|private]] [[Northeastern United States|Northeastern]] [[university-preparatory school]]s. The terms are used to denote a person seen as characteristic of a student or [[alumnus]] of these schools. Characteristics of preps in the past include a particular [[Subculture|subcultural]] speech, vocabulary, dress, mannerisms, [[etiquette]], reflective of an [[American upper class|upper-class]] upbringing.&lt;ref name="colman"&gt;{{cite news |last=Colman |first=David |title=The All-American Back From Japan |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/17/fashion/18codes.html |work= [[The New York Times]] |date=17 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition ==
The term ''preppy'' derives from the private, university-preparatory or ''prep'' schools that some [[American upper class]] and [[American upper middle class|upper-middle-class]] children attend.&lt;ref name=FashionEncyclopedia&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.fashionencyclopedia.com/fashion_costume_culture/Modern-World-1946-1960/Preppy-Look.html |title= Preppy Look| work= Fashion Encyclopedia | access-date= December 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''preppy'' is commonly associated with the [[Ivy League]] and [[Colonial Colleges|oldest universities in the Northeast]] and the prep schools which fed students to them,&lt;ref name= Hogan&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.mensflair.com/style-advice/the-roots-of-american-preppy.php| first= Chris| last= Hogan| title=  The Roots of American Preppy| website= MensFlair.com| publisher= Men's Flair | date= | access-date= December 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; since traditionally a primary goal in attending a prep school was admittance into one of these institutions.&lt;ref name= FashionEncyclopedia /&gt; Preppy fashion derives from the fashions of these old Northeastern colleges in the early to mid-twentieth century. Lisa Birnbach's 1980 book ''[[Official Preppy Handbook]]'', which was written to poke fun at the rich lives of privileged Ivy League and socially elite liberal arts college students but ended up glamorizing the culture, portrays the preppy social group as well-educated, well-connected, and although exclusive, courteous to other social groups without fostering serious relationships with them. Being well-educated and well-connected is associated with an upper-class [[socioeconomic status]] that emphasizes [[higher education]] and high-income professional success.&lt;ref name= Hogan /&gt;

== Fashion ==
[[File:Clint Eastwood 1981.png|thumb|right|[[Clint Eastwood]] wearing white golfing [[V neck]] sweater and [[racing green]] polo shirt with oversized collar, 1981]]

For men, preppy fashion has its roots in the [[Ivy League (clothes)|Ivy League style of dress]], which started around 1912 and [[1945-1960 in fashion#Ivy League|became more established in the late 1950s]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title =Elements of Fashion and Apparel Design | publisher = New Age Publishers | isbn = 81-224-1371-4 |page=25 |quote=Ivy League: A popular look for men in the fifties that originated on such campuses as Harvard, Priceton {{sic}} and Yale; a forerunner to the preppie look; a style characterized by button down collar shirts and pants with a small buckle in the back.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[J. Press]] represented the quintessential Ivy League style, stemming from the collegiate traditions of [[Ivy League]] schools. In the mid-twentieth century [[J. Press]] and [[Brooks Brothers]] both had stores on [[Ivy League]] school campuses, including [[Harvard]], [[Princeton University|Princeton]], and [[Yale]]. Preppy fashion emerged in the late 1970s with cues from the original Ivy League style. Some typical preppy styles also reflect traditional upper-class leisure activities, once associated with the wealthy English who once had a strong political and social position in the Northeast and New England, such as [[polo]], [[sailing]], [[hunting]], [[fencing]], [[rowing (sport)|crew rowing]], [[lacrosse]], [[golf]], [[tennis]], [[rugby football|rugby]], [[squash (sport)|squash]]&lt;ref name= Hogan /&gt; and [[swimming (sport)|swimming]]. This association with old English inspired outdoor activities can be seen in preppy fashion, through stripes and colors, equestrian clothing, plaid shirts, field jackets, and nautical-themed accessories. By the 1980s, mass marketing of brands such as [[Lacoste]], [[Daniel Cremieux]], [[Izod]],&lt;ref name="Peterson Kellogg 285"&gt;{{cite book |author1= Peterson, Amy T. |author2=Ann T. Kellogg  |lastauthoramp=yes |title=The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Clothing Through American History 1900 to the Present: 1900–1949 |year=2008 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=978-0-313-04334-5 |page=285}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Dooney &amp; Bourke]] became associated with [[1980s in fashion#Preppy|preppy style]] in many areas of the US and Canada.{{citation needed|date = February 2016}}

For women, preppy-influenced fashions emerged in the 1960s, a trend led by designers such as [[Perry Ellis]] and [[Lilly Pulitzer]], influenced by designers such as [[Oleg Cassini]], and popularized by female students at the [[Seven Sisters (colleges)|Seven Sisters Colleges]], sister institutions to the [[Ivy League]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Encyclopedia of New York State |year=2005 |publisher=Syracuse University Press |isbn=978-0-8156-0808-0 |page=550 |editor1-first= Peter R.| editor1-last= Eisenstadt |editor2-first= Laura-Eve| editor2-last= Moss }}&lt;/ref&gt; These classic ensembles of the 1960s and 1970s include tailored skirt suits, low heels, wrap dresses, shift dresses, silk or cotton blouses, and jewelry with a refined style. Such clothing often includes elements drawn from typical preppy style, such as nautical stripes, pastel colours, or equestrian details.

Though traditional interest in preppy style fell in the 1990s,{{according to whom|date=October 2015}} some of the newer outfitters such as [[Polo Ralph Lauren|Ralph Lauren]], [[J. Crew]], [[Vineyard Vines]], [[Gant (retailer)|Gant]], and Elizabeth McKay are perceived as having preppy styles, with designers such as [[Marc Jacobs]] and [[Luella Bartley]] adding the preppy style into their clothes in the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Camille |date= December 2, 2010| title= The Preppy Look: A Brief History |url= http://www.camillereads.com/2010/12/preppy-look-brief-history.html| website= CamilleReads.com |accessdate= December 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of preppy attire include [[Argyle (pattern)|argyle]] [[sweater]]s, crewneck sweaters, [[grosgrain]] or woven leather belts, [[chinos]],&lt;ref name= Hogan /&gt; [[madras (cloth)|madras]],&lt;ref name= colman /&gt; [[Nantucket Reds]],&lt;ref name= colman /&gt; [[button down]]&lt;ref name= Hogan /&gt; [[Oxford (cloth)|Oxford cloth]] shirts,&lt;ref name="Peterson Kellogg 285" /&gt;  pearl necklaces and earrings, gold bangle or large chain bracelets, [[penny loafers]], polo shirts (often with a popped collar), and [[boat shoes]].&lt;ref name= colman /&gt;

[[File:EAW KF850s + SB1000s (Blacklight Party).jpg|thumb|right|200px|This photo illustrates some of the professional [[sound reinforcement system]] equipment which is sold or rented at pro audio stores. Each stack of speakers in this setup consists of two EAW SB1000 slanted baffle [[subwoofer]]s (each contains two 18" drivers) and two EAW KF850 full-range cabinets for the mid and high frequencies.]]
A '''professional audio store''' is a [[retail]] business that sells, and in many cases rents, [[sound reinforcement system]] equipment and [[PA system]] components used in music concerts, live shows, dance parties and speaking events. This equipment typically includes [[microphone]]s, [[power amplifier]]s, electronic [[effects unit]]s (e.g., reverb and compression effects), [[speaker enclosure]]s, [[Foldback (sound engineering)|monitor speakers]], [[subwoofer]]s and [[audio console]]s (mixers).&lt;ref&gt;http://www23.statcan.gc.ca/imdb/p3VD.pl?Function=getVD&amp;TVD=118464&amp;CVD=118471&amp;CPV=334310&amp;CST=01012012&amp;CLV=5&amp;MLV=5 &lt;/ref&gt; Some professional audio stores also sell [[sound recording]] equipment, [[DJ]] equipment, lighting equipment used in [[nightclub]]s and concerts and video equipment used in events, such as [[video projector]]s and screens. Some professional audio stores rent "backline" equipment used in rock and pop shows, such as [[stage piano]]s and [[bass amplifier]]s. While professional audio stores typically focus on selling new merchandise, some stores also sell used equipment, which is often the equipment that the company has previously rented out for shows and events.
==Terminology==
Professional audio stores are also called "pro audio stores", "pro sound stores", "sound reinforcement" companies, "PA system companies" or "audio-visual companies", with the latter name being used when a store supplies a significant amount of video equipment for events, such as video projectors and screens. Stores often use the word "professional" in their name or the description of their store, to differentiate their stores from consumer [[electronics store]]s, which sell consumer-grade [[loudspeaker]]s, [[home cinema]] equipment, and amplifiers, which are designed for private, in-home use.

==Products==
[[File:Various-microphones.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Pro audio stores carry a range of microphones that can be used for different live sound and recording applications.]]
Pro audio stores carry a range of [[microphone]]s used in live sound and recording, including specialized mics such as drum mics. Stores typically carry wireless systems which enable microphones and electric instruments to be played without cables. Recording gear includes audio interfaces, studio monitors, audio recorders, studio subwoofers, analog-digital and digital-analog converters, studio power amplifiers and duplication equipment. Live sound equipment includes sound reinforcement system [[loudspeaker enclosure]]s, [[loudspeaker]]s, monitor speakers, power amplifiers and subwoofers. Headphone equipment includes studio and DJ headphones, [[headphone amplifier]]s and headphone mixers. [[Audio console]]s include live sound mixers, powered mixers (which have a built-in power amplifier), unpowered mixers and digital mixers. Signal processing gear includes [[DI box]]es, crossovers and a range a
of electronic effects, which are typically [[rackmount]]able units, including: [[microphone preamplifier]]s, electronic vocal processors, exciters, equalizers, compressors and limiters, feedback suppressors and [[noise gate]]s. Some stores also sell audio software, such as DAW software, signal processing software and [[Software synthesizer|virtual instruments]].

==Other products==
While some pro audio stores only sell audio equipment, others also sell products in other categories that are used in [[rock concert]]s and [[DJ]] events, such as portable stages, [[stage light]]s, [[par can]]s and light stands. Some stores sell coloured lights, lasers and strobe lights which flash, change colours and/or move according to the beat of the music; these lights are used in [[nightclub]]s and [[rave]] dance events. Some stores also sell [[fog machine]]s, which are used in dances, concerts and theatre productions, often to enhance the appearance of the lighting and laser effects. Some pro audio stores sell a range of [[DJ]] equipment, such as direct drive turntables, record cartridges and styli, DJ CD players and DJ mixers.

==Other services==
Some professional audio stores sell the services of [[audio engineer]]s, audio technicians and delivery personnel who can deliver and set up professional sound equipment and/or oversee the audio mixing of the different instruments and voices during a show or event. Some professional audio stores offer paid [[consulting]] services on professional audio issues. These consultants can come to a customer's venue, which may be a [[nightclub]], [[church (building)|church]], [[conference center]], [[auditorium]] or [[stadium]], assess its professional audio needs, and recommend the types of components–speaker enclosures, mixing boards, microphone types, and so on–that would best suit this venue and the customer's budget.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1648">A [[book]] '''prospectus''' is a printed description of or [[advertisement]] for that book, usually issued before publication in an attempt to generate interest and advance orders. The word derives from Latin, meaning literally something which gives a view or prospect (in this case of a book). Some prospectuses are lavishly produced, especially for [[private press]] books.

Printed advertisements for and catalogues of books were produced in Europe as early as the 1470s, although very few survive and what we recognize today as prospectuses (containing information on the text, physical nature, price and availability of a forthcoming book) did not develop until the seventeenth century, when they were generally issued for books published by [[subscription]]. Prospectuses are of great interest to the historian and bibliographer because they often give information about a book, its author, publisher, printer or illustrator which is not available elsewhere.

[[File:St Martin's Hall.jpg|thumb|270px|c.1850 print of the interior of St Martin's Hall]]
The '''Queen's Theatre''' in London was established in 1867 as a theatre on the site of '''St Martin's Hall''', a large concert room that had opened in 1850. It stood on the corner of [[Long Acre]] (formerly Charles Street) and Endell Street, with entrances in Wilson Street and Long Acre. The site is within the modern [[London Borough of Camden|Camden]], part of [[Covent Garden]].&lt;ref name=Tufts&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2000.01.0004&amp;query=head%3D%2336 Walter Thornbury ''Old and New London: A Narrative of its History, its People and its Places. Illustrated with Numerous Engravings from the Most Authentic Sources.: Volume 3''], accessed 1 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

St Martin's Hall contained a 3,000-seat main hall and a 500-seat lecture hall. It was used for musical recitals, lectures and political meetings. The Queen's Theatre, one of the largest in London, had a capacity of 4,000 seats. The theatre closed after barely more than a decade, in 1878.

The name Queen's Theatre has been used for other theatres in central London, including the [[Queen's Theatre, Dorset Garden]] (from 1685 to 1705), [[Her Majesty's Theatre]] (from 1705 to 1714), [[Scala Theatre]] (during the period 1831&amp;ndash;1865) and the modern [[Queen's Theatre]] in [[Shaftesbury Avenue]] (since 1907).

==History==
===St Martin's Hall===
St Martin's Hall was built for [[John Pyke Hullah|John Hullah]], in 1847, by [[William Cubitt]], from a design by [[Richard Westmacott (the younger)|Richard Westmacott]]. The scheme was financed by subscription and it was built on a parallelogram of land, {{convert|149|ft|m|1}} by {{convert|61|ft|m|1}} wide, connected to a plot on Long Acre ({{convert|44|ft|m|1}} by {{convert|22|ft|m|1}}); and consisted of a main hall with connected anterooms, galleries and a 500&amp;ndash;seat lecture hall.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/QueensLongacre.htm ''St. Martin's Music Hall''] 16 February 1850 ''The Builder'', at Arthur Lloyd theatre history site, accessed 1 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt; It was built in the [[Tudor era|Elizabethan style]], with a large domed iron roof.  The music hall was capable of seating 3,000 persons and was opened in 1850 by Hullah, the founder of a new "school of choral harmony". In addition to his singing classes, Hullah directed oratorios and concerts, both instrumental and vocal, at the hall. The hall was then used for musical recitals, lectures and political meetings.&lt;ref name=Tufts/&gt;

The [[German Reed Entertainments]] were initially presented here in 1855 &amp;ndash; known as "Miss P. Horton's Illustrative Gatherings" &amp;ndash; before moving to the more intimate [[Gallery of Illustration]] and later [[St. George's Hall, London|St George's Hall]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Williamson|first=David, ed.|year=1895|title=The German Reeds and [[Richard Corney Grain|Corney Grain]]; records and reminiscences|location=London|publisher=A.D. Innes}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles Dickens]] first appeared as a public lecturer in St Martin's Hall, in April, 1858, speaking on behalf of the Hospital for Sick Children, in [[Great Ormond Street]]. A week or two later, he spoke on his own account.&lt;ref name=Tufts/&gt;

On 26 August 1860, a fire broke out in a nearby coach factory and the hall was destroyed, together with its organ.&lt;ref name="Tufts" /&gt; The hall was rebuilt as a concert hall, opening in 1862. The [[First International]] was founded in St Martin's Hall in 1864. The final musical entertainment was given in 1867.&lt;ref name="Tufts" /&gt;

===Queen's theatre===
In 1867, a 4,000-seat theatre was built within the shell of the existing building by [[Charles J. Phipps|C. J. Phipps]]&lt;ref name=Tufts/&gt; for [[Henry Labouchère]] and his partners, with interior decoration by [[Albert Joseph Moore|Albert Moore]] and Telbin.&lt;ref&gt;Sherson p. 201&lt;/ref&gt; A new company of players was formed, including [[Charles Wyndham (actor)|Charles Wyndham]], [[Henry Irving]], [[J. L. Toole]], [[Lionel Brough]], [[Ellen Terry]] and [[Henrietta Hodson]]. The theatre opened as the New Queen's Theatre, with a production of [[Charles Reade]]'s ''The Double Marriage'' on 24 October 1867.  An early success was ''Dearer Than Life'', by [[H. J. Byron]], with Brough, Toole, Wyndham, Hodson and Irving, coupled with [[W. S. Gilbert]]'s ''[[La Vivandière (Gilbert)|La Vivandière]]'', a [[Victorian burlesque|burlesque]] of ''[[La fille du régiment]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Sherson, p. 202&lt;/ref&gt;  The theatre continued with melodrama, adaptions and classic revivals, dropping the epithet 'new' the following year.

[[File:Turn-of-the-tide.jpg|thumb|left|1869 programme]]
Initially, the management was run by the actor [[Alfred Wigan]], who also appeared in its productions. By 1868, Hodson and Labouchère were living together out of wedlock,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.labouchere.co.uk/linkpages/labbyanddora.htm ''Labby and Dora''] (Labouchere genealogy site) accessed 1 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt; as they could not marry until her first husband finally died in 1887.&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1883/01/17/106245396.pdf ''London Facts and Gossip''] 17 January 1883 ''[[The New York Times]]'' accessed 1 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Labouchère bought out his partners and used the theatre to showcase Hodson's talents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gabrielleray.150m.com/ArchiveTextH/HenriettaHodson.html Feature on Hodson in Footlights Notes] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707060227/http://www.gabrielleray.150m.com/ArchiveTextH/HenriettaHodson.html |date=7 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The theatre hosted comedies, such as [[F. C. Burnand]]'s ''The Turn of the Tide'' (1869, starring [[Hermann Vezin]] and [[George Rignold]] with Hodson), historical dramas, such as [[Tom Taylor]]'s ''Twixt Axe and Crown'' (1870), popular revivals of [[Shakespeare]] (starring such famous actors as [[Samuel Phelps]]) and [[Tommaso Salvini]], dramatisations of Dickens novels, burlesques and [[extravaganza]]s. Although the theatre was among the largest and best equipped in London, and featured some of London's most famous stars, it lacked the guidance of an actor-manager of the stature of [[Henry Irving]] or [[Herbert Beerbohm Tree]].&lt;ref&gt;Sherson pp. 209&amp;ndash;10&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1877, the theatre became the National Theatre and hosted a series of promenade concerts under Riviere and [[Alfred Cellier]]&lt;ref&gt;Sherson p. 208&lt;/ref&gt; followed by an ambitious dramatisation of ''[[The Last Days of Pompeii]]'' ([[Edward Bulwer-Lytton, 1st Baron Lytton|Lord Lytton]]'s eponymous novel) that was meant to feature a staged eruption of Vesuvius, an earthquake and a sybriatic Roman feast.  However, the earth did not quake, the volcano did not erupt, acrobats fell onto the cast below, and the production was an expensive flop.&lt;ref&gt;Sherson p. 204&lt;/ref&gt; The same year, the theatre was joined by overhead wires to the [[Canterbury Music Hall]] in [[Lambeth]], and public demonstrations of the [[C. F. Varley|Cromwell Varley]] telephone were given. Several simple tunes were transmitted and emitted softly from a large drum-like apparatus suspended over the proscenium.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.victorianlondon.org/publications5/londoners-44.htm ''London and Londoners in the Eighteen-Fifties and Sixties''], Alfred Rosling Bennett (1924) Chapter 44 ''The Drama'' (The Victorian Dictionary) accessed 1 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The theatre was open for little more than a decade, closing in April 1878.  The interior was converted into a department store for the "Clerical Co-operative Society" and later occupied by the [[Odhams Press]]. The façade remained until redeveloped into a residential block in the 1970s.

'''Sa'at Tower''' also known as '''Tabriz Municipality Palace''' ({{lang-fa|کاخ شهرداری تبریز}}, also [[Romanize]]d as '''Sā'at Tower''') is building in Tabriz which used as the city hall and main office of the municipal government of [[Tabriz]], [[East Azarbaijan Province]], [[Iran]]. Saat tower or Saat in brief, as it briefed by locals in Tabriz, is a building with a hall, a tower with clock, and a small garden in Southwestern side of the building. A circular pool with fountains is located in the middle of the garden.

==History==
The municipality building was built in 1934 as the Tabriz municipal central office and its city hall. After [[Second World War|World War II]] it was used by the [[Azerbaijan People's Government|Azerbaijan Democrat Party]] as the Government Office, where cabinet meeting used to be held in its main hall. When Iranian troops regained control of Tabriz in 1947, the building was again used as the Tabriz municipal central offices, a function which has continued up to early 2000s when it is used as municipal museum.
===Current alterations===
During the 1990s, in an attempt for installing an elevator, one of ''Saat'''s patios was damaged. The dome in top of the tower of Saat was reconstructed on 2008 with a new khaki colored fiber glass instead of the original silver colored dome. Since 2007, part of the building houses the Municipal Museum.

==Museum of Municipality==
In recent years parts of the building is reorganized as municipality museum of Tabriz. The museum includes historical maps of Tabriz, photos of new establishments and major constructions works in Tabriz, and golden key of Tabriz. There are also some of early vehicles, equipment, and machinery used in the city including: first movie projector, first taxi cars, and firefighting tracks. The major hall of the museum includes Tabriz municipality collection of Tabriz rugs.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Ceremonies==
Since Saat Tower is located in the center of the city, it has been used for various ceremonies and gatherings in the city. During 1947 it was used as the seat of the Azerbaijan Peoples' Government.

* ''Iranian new year'', at the beginning of every new Iranian Year (20 March), a big [[Haft-Sin]] is made behind Saat.
* ''Earth hour'', since 2014 Tabriz celebrate the earth hour by turning off the lights for Saat Tower.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://shahryarnews.net/?MID=21&amp;Type=News&amp;TypeID=1&amp;id=11344|title=پایگاه اطلاع رسانی و فرهنگی شهریار|publisher=shahryarnews.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
Sa'at means "clock", which refers to the four face clock in top of the tower. Some calls the Saat building, Municipality Palace of Tabriz.

'''Saint Valentine''' ({{lang-it|San Valentino}}, {{lang-la|Valentinus}}), officially '''Saint Valentine of Rome''',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history.com/news/6-surprising-facts-about-st-valentine 6 surprising facts about St Valentine]&lt;/ref&gt; was a widely recognized 3rd-century Roman [[saint]] commemorated on February 14 and since the [[High Middle Ages]] is associated with a tradition of [[courtly love]].

All that is reliably known of the saint commemorated on February 14 is his name and that he was martyred and buried at a cemetery on the [[Via Flaminia]] close to the [[Ponte Milvio]] to the north of Rome on that day. It is uncertain whether Saint Valentine was one individual or a pseudonym for several. Several different [[Martyrology|martyrologies]] have been added to later [[Hagiography|hagiographies]] that are unreliable.

Because so little is reliably known of him, in 1969 the [[Catholic Church]] removed his name from the [[General Roman Calendar]], leaving his liturgical celebration to local calendars.&lt;ref&gt;''Calendarium Romanum'' Libreria Editrice Vaticana (1969), p. 117&lt;/ref&gt; The Roman Catholic Church continues to recognize him as a saint, listing him as such in the February 14 entry in the [[Roman Martyrology]],&lt;ref&gt;''[[Roman Martyrology]]'', Libreria Editrice Vaticana, 2001, p. 141&lt;/ref&gt; and authorizing liturgical veneration of him on February 14 in any place where that day is not devoted to some other obligatory celebration in accordance with the rule that on such a day the Mass may be that of any saint listed in the Martyrology for that day.&lt;ref&gt;[[General Instruction of the Roman Missal]], 355&lt;/ref&gt; Use of the pre-1970 liturgical calendar is also authorized under the conditions indicated in the motu proprio ''[[Summorum Pontificum]]'' of 2007. Saint Valentine's Church in Rome, built in 1960 for the needs of the [[Olympic Village]], continues as a modern, well-visited parish church.

Saint Valentine is commemorated in the [[Anglican Communion]],&lt;ref name=Anglican&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.churchofengland.org/prayer-worship/worship/texts/the-calendar/holydays.aspx|title=Holy Days|year=2012|publisher=[[Church of England]] (Anglican Communion)|accessdate=October 27, 2012|quote=February 14 Valentine, Martyr at Rome, c.269}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in [[Lutheranism]], on February 14.&lt;ref name="Pfatteicher2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=Pfatteicher|first=Philip H.|title=New Book of Festivals and Commemorations: A Proposed Common Calendar of Saints|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W82FOCZ4hmwC&amp;pg=PA86|accessdate=October 27, 2012|date=August 1, 2008|publisher=Fortress Press|isbn=9780800621285|page=86|quote=IO}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Lutheran Service Book, with its penchant for the old Roman calendar, commemorates Valentine on this date. By some of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], Saint Valentine the Presbyter of Rome is celebrated on July 6&lt;ref&gt;[http://ocafs.oca.org/FeastSaintsLife.asp?FSID=101926 ''Martyr Valentinus the Presbyter and those with him at Rome''].

==Identification==
The name ''Valentinus'' does not occur in the earliest list of Roman martyrs, the [[Chronography of 354]], although the patron of the Chronography's compilation was a wealthy Roman Christian named Valentinus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/index.htm#Chronography_of_354 Roger Pearse, ''The Chronography of 354'' in "Early Church Fathers" online.] ''Retrieved September 27, 2012''&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is found in the [[Martyrologium Hieronymianum]],&lt;ref&gt;''"XVI kalendas Martii Interamnae Via Flaminia miliario ab Urbe Roma LXIII natale Valentini."'' In J. B. de Rossi, p. 20 (XVI KL. MAR.). See also M. Schoepflin, p. 40: ''"the original text"''.&lt;/ref&gt; which was compiled between 460 and 544 from earlier local sources. The feast of St. Valentine of February 14 was first established in 496 by [[Pope Gelasius I]], who included Valentine among all those "... whose names are justly reverenced among men, but whose acts are known only to God." As Gelasius implies, nothing was then known about his life.

''The Catholic Encyclopedia''&lt;ref name=Thurston&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15254a.htm|title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: St. Valentine|work=newadvent.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other [[Hagiography|hagiographical]] sources&lt;ref&gt;René Aigrain, ''Hagiographie: Ses sources, ses méthodes, son histoire,'' (Paris 1953, pp 268–69; Agostino S. Amore, "S. Valentino di Roma o di Terni?", ''Antonianum'' '''41'''.(1966), pp 260–77.&lt;/ref&gt; speak of three Saint Valentines that appear in connection with February 14. One was a Roman priest, another the bishop of Interamna (modern [[Terni]], Italy) both buried along the [[Via Flaminia]] outside Rome, at different distances from the city. The third was said to be a saint who suffered on the same day with a number of companions in the [[Africa (Roman province)|Roman province of Africa]], of whom nothing else is known.

Though the extant accounts of the martyrdoms of the first two listed saints are of a late date and contain legendary elements, ''a common nucleus of fact'' may underlie the two accounts and they may refer to ''a single person''.&lt;ref&gt;Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church, 1983, p. 1423&lt;/ref&gt; According to the official biography of the Diocese of Terni, Bishop Valentine was born and lived in Interamna and while on a temporary stay in Rome he was imprisoned, tortured, and martyred there on February 14, 269. His body was hastily buried at a nearby cemetery and a few nights later his disciples retrieved his body and returned him home.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.diocesi.terni.it/sanvalentino/biografia/main.php?cat_id=1001&amp;subcat_id=240 ''San Valentino: Biografia.''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121229053757/http://www.diocesi.terni.it/sanvalentino/biografia/main.php?cat_id=1001&amp;subcat_id=240 |date=December 29, 2012 }}. [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Terni-Narni-Amelia|Diocese of Terni]]. 2009. English version, written probably after examining all previous sources.&lt;/ref&gt;

Τhe ''[[Roman Martyrology]]'', the Catholic Church's official list of recognized saints, for February 14 gives only one Saint Valentine: a martyr who died on the Via Flaminia.&lt;ref&gt;''Martyrologium Romanum 2001'', February 14, p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other saints with the same name==
The name "Valentine" derived from ''valens'' (worthy, strong, powerful), was popular in [[Late Antiquity]]. About eleven other saints having the name Valentine are commemorated in the Roman Catholic Church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholic.org/saints/stindex.php?lst=V|title=Saints A to Z: V|work=Catholic Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some Eastern Churches of the Western rite may provide still other different lists of Saint Valentines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orthodoxengland.btinternet.co.uk/saintsv.htm|title=''Latin saints of the Orthodox Patriarchate of Rome''|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120717032135/http://www.orthodoxengland.btinternet.co.uk/saintsv.htm|archivedate=July 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Roman martyrology lists only seven who died on days ''other'' than February 14: a priest from [[Viterbo]] (November 3); a bishop from [[Raetia]] who died in about 470 (January 7); a 5th-century priest and hermit (July 4); [[Saint Fructus|a Spanish hermit who died in about 715]] (October 25); Valentine Berrio Ochoa, martyred in 1861 (November 24); and Valentine Jaunzarás Gómez, martyred in 1936 (September 18). It also lists a virgin, Saint Valentina, who was martyred in 308 (July 25) in Caesarea, Palestine.&lt;ref&gt;''Martyrologium Romanum (Libreria Editrice Vaticana, 2001.'' Index, p. 768; Saint Valentina okay finep. 390.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hagiography and testimony==
[[File:Valentineanddisciples.jpg|thumb|left|Saint Valentine of Terni oversees the construction of his [[basilica]] at [[Terni]], from a 14th-century French manuscript ([[Bibliothèque National|BN]], Mss fr. 185)]]
The inconsistency in the identification of the saint is replicated in the various vitae that are ascribed to him.

A common hagiography describes Saint Valentine as a priest of Rome or as the former Bishop of [[Terni]], an important town of [[Umbria]], in central [[Italy]]. While under house arrest of Judge Asterius, and discussing his faith with him, Valentinus (the Latin version of his name) was discussing the validity of [[Jesus]]. The judge put Valentinus to the test and brought to him the judge's adopted blind daughter. If Valentinus succeeded in restoring the girl's sight, Asterius would do whatever he asked. Valentinus laid his hands on her eyes and the child's vision was restored. Immediately humbled, the judge asked Valentinus what he should do. Valentinus replied that all of the [[Idolatry|idols]] around the judge's house should be broken, and that the judge should fast for three days and then undergo [[baptism]]. The judge obeyed and, as a result, freed all the [[Christian]] inmates under his authority. The judge, his family, and his forty-four member [[household]] (family members and servants) were baptized.&lt;ref&gt;Castleden, Rodney, "The Book of Saints". 2006, p.28.&lt;/ref&gt; Valentinus was later arrested again for continuing to proselytize and was sent to the prefect of Rome, to the emperor [[Claudius Gothicus]] (Claudius II) himself. Claudius took a liking to him until Valentinus tried to convince Claudius to embrace Christianity, whereupon Claudius refused and condemned Valentinus to death, commanding that Valentinus either renounce his faith or he would be beaten with clubs, and beheaded. Valentinus refused and Claudius' command was executed outside the [[Piazza del Popolo|Flaminian Gate]] February 14, 269.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholic.org/saints/saint.php?saint_id=159|title=St. Valentine|work=Catholic Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Golden Legend|Legenda Aurea]]'' of [[Jacobus de Voragine]], compiled about 1260 and one of the most-read books of the High Middle Ages, gives sufficient details of the saints for each day of the liturgical year to inspire a homily on each occasion. The very brief ''vita'' of St Valentine has him executed for refusing to deny Christ by the order of the "Emperor Claudius"&lt;ref&gt;Under the circumstances, the Emperor Claudius was a detail meant to enhance verisimilitude. Attempts to identify him with the only 3rd-century Claudius, [[Claudius Gothicus]], who spent his brief reign (268–270) away from Rome winning his [[cognomen]], are illusions in pursuit of a literary phantom: "No evidence outside several late saints' legends suggests that Claudius II reversed the policy of toleration established by the policy of his predecessor [[Gallienus]]", Jack Oruch states, in "St. Valentine, Chaucer, and Spring in February", ''Speculum'' '''56'''.3 (July 1981), p 536, referencing [[William H. C. Frend]], ''Martyrdom and Persecution in the Early Church'' (New York, 1967, p 326.&lt;/ref&gt; in the year 269. Before his head was cut off, this Valentine restored sight and hearing to the daughter of his jailer. Jacobus makes a play with the etymology of "Valentine", "as containing valour".

A popularly ascribed hagiographical identity appears in the [[Nuremberg Chronicle]] (1493). Alongside a woodcut portrait of Valentine, the text states that he was a Roman priest martyred during the reign of [[Claudius Gothicus]].&lt;!--is the following in the Nuremberg Chronicle?--&gt; He was arrested and imprisoned upon being caught marrying Christian couples and otherwise aiding Christians who were at the time being persecuted by Claudius in Rome. Helping Christians at this time was considered a crime. Claudius took a liking to this prisoner. However, when Valentinus tried to convert the Emperor, he was condemned to death. He was beaten with clubs and stones; when that failed to kill him, he was beheaded outside the [[Piazza del Popolo|Flaminian Gate]]. Various dates are given for the martyrdom or martyrdoms: 269, 270, or 273.&lt;ref&gt;Jack Oruch, "St. Valentine, Chaucer, and Spring in February", ''Speculum'' '''56'''.3 (July 1981 pp 534–565) p 535.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many other legends behind Saint Valentine. One is that in the 3rd century AD{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} it is said that Valentine, who was a priest, defied the order of the emperor Claudius and secretly married couples so that the husbands wouldn't have to go to war. The legend claims that soldiers were sparse at this time so this was a big inconvenience to the emperor. Another legend is that Valentine refused to sacrifice to pagan gods. Being imprisoned for this, Valentine gave his testimony in prison and through his prayers healed the jailer's daughter who was suffering from blindness. On the day of his execution he left her a note that was signed, "Your Valentine".

==Churches named Valentine==
[[Image:St-Valentine-Kneeling-In-Supplication.jpg|thumb|''St Valentine Kneeling in Supplication'' ([[David Teniers III]], 1600s) - Valentine kneels to receive a [[rosary]] from the [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Virgin Mary]]]]

Saint Valentine was not exceptionally more venerated than other saints and it seems that in England no church was ever [[dedication|dedicated]] to him.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Ansgar Kelly, in ''Chaucer and the Cult of Saint Valentine''. 1986, p. 62, says: ''As Thurston has noted, no English church is known to have been dedicated to St. Valentine'' (Thurston, Butler's Lives, 2:217). '' I should add that we have no record of a large number of churches in England.''&lt;/ref&gt; There are many churches containing the name of Valentine in other countries such as Italy.

A 5th- or 6th-century work called ''Passio Marii et Marthae'' made up a legend about Saint Valentine's Basilica being dedicated to Saint Valentine in Rome. A later ''Passio'' repeated the legend and added the adornment that [[Pope Julius I]] (357–352) had built the ancient basilica ''S. Valentini extra Portam'' on top of his sepulchre, in the Via Flaminia.&lt;ref name="ansgar49"/&gt; This church was really named after a 4th-century tribune called Valentino, who donated the land on which it is built.&lt;ref name="ansgar49"&gt;Ansgar, 1986, pp. 49–50&lt;/ref&gt; It hosted the martyr's relics until the 13th century, when they were transferred to [[Santa Prassede]], and the ancient basilica decayed.&lt;ref name="hulsen"&gt;Christian Hülsen, ''Chiese di Roma nel Medio Evo'' (Florence: Olschki, ([http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/I/Gazetteer/Places/Europe/Italy/Lazio/Roma/Rome/churches/_Texts/Huelsen/HUECHI*/2/TZ.html On-line text]).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Saint Valentine's Day==
{{main article|Valentine's Day}}

English 18th-century antiquarians [[Alban Butler]] and [[Francis Douce]], noting the obscurity of Saint Valentine's identity, suggested that Valentine's Day was created as an attempt to supersede the pagan holiday of [[Lupercalia]] (mid-February in Rome). This idea has lately been dismissed by other researchers, such as Professor Jack B. Oruch of the [[University of Kansas]], Henry Ansgar Kelly of the [[University of California, Los Angeles]]&lt;ref name="Kelly1986"&gt;{{cite book|author=Henry Ansgar Kelly|title=Chaucer and the Cult of Saint Valentine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_bqdZbKPztMC&amp;pg=PA60|year=1986|publisher=BRILL|isbn=90-04-07849-5|pages=58–63}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Associate Professor Michael Matthew Kaylor of the [[Masaryk University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title= Secreted Desires: The Major Uranians: Hopkins, Pater and Wilde |author= Michael Matthew Kaylor |publisher= [[Masaryk University]] Press |year= 2006 |isbn= 80-210-4126-9 |edition= electronic |page= footnote 2 in page 235 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=-Wa7SIsAQgAC&amp;pg=PA235&amp;dq=saint+valentine's+day+lupercalia#v=onepage&amp;q=saint%20valentine's%20day%20lupercalia&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the current legends that characterize Saint Valentine were invented in the 14th century in England, notably by [[Geoffrey Chaucer]] and his circle, when the feast day of February 14 first became associated with [[romantic love]].&lt;ref&gt;Jack Oruch identified the inception of this possible connection in Butler's ''Lives of the... Saints'', 1756, and Douce's ''Illustrations of Shakespeare, and of Ancient Manner'', ''see'' {{cite journal|last1=Oruch|first1=Jack B.|title=St. Valentine, Chaucer, and Spring in February|journal=Speculum|date=July 1981|volume=56|issue=3|page=534|doi=10.2307/2847741}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oruch charges that the traditions associated with "Valentine's Day", documented in [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s ''[[Parlement of Foules]]'' and set in the fictional context of an old tradition, did not exist before Chaucer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Oruch|first1=Jack B.|title=St. Valentine, Chaucer, and Spring in February|journal=Speculum|date=July 1981|volume=56|issue=3|pages=534–565|doi=10.2307/2847741}}&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that the speculative explanation of sentimental customs, posing as historical fact, had their origins among 18th-century [[Antiquary|antiquaries]], notably [[Alban Butler]], the author of ''Butler's Lives of Saints'', and have been perpetuated even by respectable modern scholars. In the French 14th-century manuscript illumination from a ''Vies des Saints'' (''illustration above''), Saint Valentine, bishop of Terni, oversees the construction of his basilica at [[Terni]]; there is no suggestion here that the bishop was a patron of lovers.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bibliothèque nationale de France|BN]], Mss fr. 185. The book of ''Lives of the Saints'', with [[Illuminated manuscript|illuminations]] by Richard de Montbaston and collaborators, was among the manuscripts that [[Cardinal Richelieu]] bequeathed to the King of France.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Middle Ages, it was believed that birds paired in mid-February. This was then associated with the romance of Valentine. Although these legends differ, Valentine’s Day is widely recognized as a day for [[Romance (love)|romance]] and devotion.

==Relics and liturgical celebration==
[[File:St-valentine 110921-01.jpg|thumb|upright|Shrine of St. Valentine in Whitefriar Street Carmelite Church in Dublin, Ireland]]
[[File:Rom, Santa Maria in Cosmedin, Reliquien des Hl. Valentin von Terni.jpg|thumb|Relic of St. Valentine in the church of Santa Maria in Cosmedin, Rome.]]
The flower-crowned alleged skull of St. Valentine is exhibited in the Basilica of [[Santa Maria in Cosmedin]], Rome.

St. Valentine's remains are deposited in St Anton's Church, [[Madrid]], where they have lain since the late 1700s. They were a present from the Pope to King [[Carlos IV]], who entrusted them to the Order of Poor Clerics Regular of the Mother of God of the Pious Schools ([[Piarists]]). The relics have been displayed publicly since 1984, in a foundation open to the public at all times in order help people in need.

St. Valentine's remains are also claimed to be in Dublin. In 1836, some [[relic]]s that were exhumed from the [[catacombs]] of Saint Hippolytus on the [[Via Tiburtina]], then near (rather than inside) Rome, were identified with St Valentine; placed in a casket, and transported to the procession to the high altar for a special Mass dedicated to young people and all those in love. Also in 1836, Fr. John Spratt, an Irish priest and famous preacher, was given many tokens of esteem following a sermon in Rome. One gift from Pope Gregory XVI were the remains of St. Valentine and "a small vessel tinged with his blood." The Reliquary was placed in Whitefriar Street Church in [[Dublin]], Ireland, and has remained there until this day. This was accompanied by a letter claiming the relics were those of St. Valentine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.carmelites.ie/ireland/whitefriar%20st/valentine.htm ''Shrine of St Valentine, Whitefriar Street Church, Irish Province of the Order of Carmelites''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130126100202/http://www.carmelites.ie/ireland/whitefriar%20st/valentine.htm |date=January 26, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Another relic was found in 2003 in [[Prague]] in Church of St Peter and Paul at [[Vyšehrad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radio.cz/cz/rubrika/udalosti/ostatky-svvalentyna-jsou-ulozeny-na-prazskem-vysehrade|title=Radio Praha - Ostatky sv.Valentýna jsou uloženy na pražském Vyšehradě|work=radio.cz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A silver reliquary containing a fragment of St. Valentine's skull is found in the parish church of St. Mary's Assumption in Chelmno, Poland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chelmno.pl/index_en.php?cid=296|title=Chełmno - miasto zabytków i zakochanych|work=chelmno.pl|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150123191803/http://chelmno.pl/index_en.php?cid=296|archivedate=January 23, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atlasobscura.com/places/relics-st-valentine-chelmno|title=Skull bits of St. Valentine in Chelmno|work=Atlas Obscura}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Relics can also be found in the Greek island of Lesbos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://greece.greekreporter.com/2015/02/14/the-holy-relics-of-st-valentine-lie-on-lesbos-island/|title=The Holy Relics of St. Valentine Lie on Lesbos Island|work=Greek Reporter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another set of relics can also be found in [[Savona]], in the Cathedral of Santa Maria Assunta.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.informagiovani-italia.com/savona.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Alleged relics of St. Valentine also lie at the reliquary of [[Roquemaure, Gard]], France, in the [[St. Stephen's Cathedral, Vienna]], in [[Balzan]] in [[Malta]] and also in Blessed John [[Duns Scotus]]' church in the [[Gorbals]] area of [[Glasgow]], Scotland. There is also a gold reliquary bearing the words "Corpus St. Valentin, M" (Body of St. Valentine, Martyr) at [[Birmingham Oratory]], UK, in one of the side altars in the main church.

Saint Valentine remains in the Roman Catholic Church's official list of saints, the ''[[Roman Martyrology]]'', but, in view of the scarcity of information about him, his commemoration was removed from the [[General Roman Calendar]], when this was revised in 1969. It is included in local calendars of places such as [[Balzan]] in [[Malta]]. Some [[Traditionalist Catholic]]s observe earlier calendars of the Roman Rite, in which Saint Valentine was celebrated as a [[General Roman Calendar of 1954#Rank of Feasts|Simple Feast]] until 1955, when [[Pope Pius XII]] reduced the mention of him to a [[commemoration (liturgy)|commemoration]] in the [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] of the day, a position it kept in the [[General Roman Calendar of 1960]] incorporated in the 1962 edition of the [[Roman Missal]], use of which, as an [[extraordinary form of the Roman Rite]], is still authorized in accordance with [[Pope Benedict XVI]]'s 2007 [[motu proprio]] ''[[Summorum Pontificum]]''.

February 14 is also celebrated as St. Valentine's Day in other Christian Churches; in the Church of England, for example, it was included in Calendars before the Reformation, and S.Valentine, Bishop and Martyr, was restored to the Church's Calendar in the 1661–62 ''[[Book of Common Prayer]]''. He remains in the Calendars of the [[Church of England]] and in those of most other parts of the [[Anglican Communion]], albeit sometimes noted as an ancient memorial of obscure historical character&lt;ref&gt;See February calendar listed [http://www.churchofengland.org/prayer-worship/worship/texts/the-calendar/holydays.aspx here] on the Church of England website.&lt;/ref&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;http://prayerbook.ca/resources/bcponline/calendar/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Seth Siegelaub''' (born 1941, Bronx, New York - June 15, 2013, Basel, Switzerland) was an American-born [[art dealer]], [[curator]], author and [[researcher]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://galleristny.com/2013/06/seth-siegelaub-pioneering-dealer-and-curator-of-conceptual-art-dies-at-71/|title=Seth Siegelaub, Pioneering Dealer and Curator of Conceptual Art, Dies at 71|last=Russeth |first=Andrew|date=2013-06-17|publisher=GalleristNY.com (website of [[The New York Observer]])|accessdate=9 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is best known for his innovative promotion of [[conceptual art]] in New York in the 1960s and 70s.,&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Alberro and Blake Stimson, ''Conceptual Art: A Critical Anthology'', MIT Press, 1999, pxl. {{ISBN|0-262-51117-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; but has also been a political researcher and publisher, [[textile history]] bibliographer and collector, and a researcher working on a project on time and [[Causality (physics)|causality]] in physics.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20111008070113/http://egressfoundation.net/egress/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=62&amp;Itemid=77%2F "Who Is Seth Siegelaub?"]&lt;/ref&gt;

At his gallery, "Seth Siegelaub Contemporary Art", operating between the Fall 1964 and April 1966, for one exhibition Siegelaub encouraged visitors to lounge on couches and chairs to appreciate the show as an overall environment and hosted a four-day [[happening]] featuring the artist Arni Hendin.&lt;ref name=Alberro10&gt;Alexander Alberro, ''Conceptual Art and the Politics of Publicity'', MIT Press, 2003, pp10-11. {{ISBN|0-262-51184-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was an aggressive promoter and paid as much attention to press and publicity as to the content of exhibitions, showing that even unconventional art work could be sold.&lt;ref name=Alberro10/&gt;

He was also the originator and author, with lawyer Robert Projansky, of "The Artist's Reserved Rights Transfer and Sale Agreement," published in 1971, which has been translated and published in French, Italian, German and Dutch.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.primaryinformation.org/index.php?/projects/siegelaubartists-rights/ "The Artist's Rights Transfer and Sale Agreement"]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Shah Jo Risalo''''' ({{lang-sd|&lt;big&gt;'''شاھ جو رسالو'''&lt;/big&gt;}}) is a poetic compendium of famous [[Sindhi people|Sindhi]] Sufi poet [[Shah Abdul Latif Bhittai]]. In fact, it is many compendia, for Shah Abdul Latif's poetry in various forms of [[Beit|bayt]] and wai was compiled by many of his devotees during his lifetime and after his death. The devotees compiled his poetry and designated it as '''Shah Jo Risalo''' or '''Poetry of Shah'''.

[[Ernest Trumpp]] called it [[Diwan (poetry)|Diwan]] when he edited the ''Risalo'' and published it from [[Leipzig]], [[Germany]] in 1866 A.D. Afterwards, many scholars and linguists have published the Shah Jo Risalo with their own compilations, hence many editions are available.

Shah Jo Risalo, written in very pure and concise [[Sindhi language|Sindhi]] verses, is great storehouse for Muslims but also for the Hindus. Shah Abdul Latif has hidden his mystical ideas under layers of symbols taken from all spheres of life as well as from the classical Sufi tradition, and particularly from Maulana [[Rumi]]'s [[Mathnawi]].&lt;ref&gt;Annemarie Schimmel, ''Pearls from the Indus:Studies in Sindhi Culture'' Jamshoro, Sindh, Pakistan: Sindhi Adabi Board (1986). See pp. 111.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Surs (chapters) ==
The traditional compilations of Shah Jo Risalo include 30 Surs (chapters) which were compiled by renowned researchers. The oldest publications of Shah Jo Risalo contained some 36 Surs, but later most of the linguists discarded 6 Surs, as their language and content did not match the Shah's style. Recently, Dr. Nabi Bakhsh Baloch, a renowned linguist of the [[Sindhi language]], has compiled and printed a new edition after 32 years of research into folk culture, language and the history of Sindhi language. Another poet Dr Aurangzeb Siyal has recently launched a book named "Louk Zangeer" in which he has attempted to define three Surs i-e Momal Rano, Sasui Punho and Umar Marvi in an easy manner and in different poetic style.

The word "[[Svara|Sur]]", from [[Sanskrit]] word [[Svara]], means a mode of singing. The Surs are sung as [[Raga]]s In [[Indian classical music]], its "Ragas" and "Raginis" are sung at different times of day and night. In Risalo the Surs are named according to their subject matter. The underlying theme is how the individual is to cultivate the godly attributes, negate his ego so as to evolve to a better human being.

The traditional 30 Surs included in Shah Jo Risalo are:

These Surs contain [[Beit|Bayts]] which Shah latif sang in state of ecstasy. These Bayts in the Surs concerning the life-stories of his heroines, viz. Suhni, Sassui, Lila, Mumal, Marui, Nuri and Sorath, are not in chronological sequences, for the Sufi Poet in his state of "Wajd" or ecstasy, was concerned with the moments of denouncements in life-stories, which he used as allegories to express his mystical experiences.

== Shah's Heroines ==
{{Main|The Seven Queens of Sindh}}

The [[heroines]] of Shah Abdul Latif Bhittai's poetry are known as the Seven queens of [[Sindhi folklore]] who have been given the status of royalty in Shah Jo Risalo. The Seven Queens are celebrated throughout [[Sindh]] for their positive qualities: [[honesty]], [[integrity]], [[piety]] and [[loyalty]]. They are also valued for their [[bravery]] and their willingness to risk their lives in the name of [[love]]. The Seven Queens mentioned in Shah Jo Risalo are '''Marui, Momal, Sassui, Noori, Sohni, Sorath, and Lila'''. In his poetry Shah has alluded in elaborate way to these characters of Sindhi folktales and used them as metaphors for high spiritual life.

Perhaps what Shah Abdul Latif Bhittai saw in his tales of these [[women]] was an idealized view of [[womanhood]], but the truth remains that the Seven Queens inspired women all over Sindh to have the courage to choose love and freedom over tyranny and oppression. The lines from the Risalo describing their trials are sung at Sufi shrines all over Sindh, and especially at the ''[[urs]]'' of Shah Abdul Latif every year at Bhit Shah.

These romantic tales of Bhittai are commonly known as ''[[Momal Rano]]'', ''[[Umar Marvi|Umar Marui]]'', ''[[Sohni Mehar]]'', ''[[Lilan Chanesar]]'', ''[[Noori Jam Tamachi]]'', ''[[Sassui Punnhun]]'' and ''[[Raja Dhach]]'' or Seven Queens ({{lang|sd|&lt;big&gt;ست سورميون&lt;/big&gt;}}) of [[Shah Abdul Latif Bhittai]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thesindhuworld.com/lila_chanesar.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-06-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721224737/http://www.thesindhuworld.com/lila_chanesar.html |archivedate=2011-07-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://balochistan.bestforum.ca/t16-sassui-punnun |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-06-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110812045415/http://balochistan.bestforum.ca/t16-sassui-punnun |archivedate=2011-08-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://balochistan.bestforum.ca/t16-sassui-punnun |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-06-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110812045415/http://balochistan.bestforum.ca/t16-sassui-punnun |archivedate=2011-08-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Sassui Punnhun]]'' and ''Sohni Mehar'' aka [[Sohni Mahiwal]] in [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] are also celebrated in [[Punjab, India|Punjab]] along with ''[[Heer Ranjha]]'' and ''[[Mirza Sahiban]]'' and thus form part of Punjabi traditions.

These nine tragic romances from [[South Asia]] (all from present day [[Pakistan]]) have become part of the cultural identity of Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;http://punjabiworld.com/Creative-Punjab/Legends-of-Punjab/love-legends-of-punjab.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Translations ==
Shah Jo Risalo was first translated into [[German language|German]] in 1866 by Ernest Trump, a German scholar and missionary when in 1860s he became fascinated by [[Sindhi language]] and culture and the [[jogi]]s and singers who sang Shah Latif’s verses. With the help of Sindhi scholars he compiled a selection of the original verses and called it "Shah Jo Risalo" (the message of Shah). It was first translated in English by [[Elsa Kazi]], a German lady married to [[Allama I. I. Kazi]], who translated selections of Shah Jo Risalo in English prose. Later in 1940, Dr H.T Sorley, an English scholar learnt Sindhi, and published selections from the Risalo by the Oxford University Press entitled "Shah Abdul latif of Bhit - His Poetry, Life and Times".

The most recent work (1994) of translation of Risalo into English is that of Amena Khamisani, a professor in English Literature at the [[University of Sindh|Sindh University]]. [[Shaikh Ayaz]], the famous Sindhi poet, translated Risalo into [[Urdu]]. Risalo is also translated in [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] and more recently [[French language|French]] translation was also undertaken by Cultural department of Sindh. Part of Risalo is also translated in Arabic.
There is one more translation of Shah Abdul Latif by name "Seeking The Beloved" translated by Hari Daryani 'Dilgir' a noted Sindhi poet and Anju Makhija. This book was honoured with Sahitya Akademi Award for translation in the year 2012.

'''''Smith Journal''''' is a quarterly Australian magazine based in Melbourne, and founded in 2011. The publication focuses on history, photography, art, and design, but also features articles on architecture, fashion, science, DIY, adventure, and literature. ''Smith Journal'' is published by Frankie Press,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.frankiepress.com.au/|title=frankie press // frankie magazine // smith journal // Slow|website=www.frankiepress.com.au|access-date=2018-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; creators of popular Australian magazine '''''[[Frankie (magazine)|frankie]]'''.'' The magazine is lauded for sharing the same "inquisitive nature, intelligent copy and compelling stories"&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.pedestrian.tv/news/meet-frankies-mens-spinoff-smith-journal/|title=Meet Frankie's Men's Spinoff "Smith Journal" – Pedestrian TV|date=9 August 2011|work=Pedestrian TV|access-date=2018-01-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; as ''frankie''.

== History and profile ==
''Smith Journal'' was founded by frankie press editors-at-large Rick Bannister and Louise Bannister as a men’s magazine in the same vein as ''frankie.'' It was designed to attract readers interested in “real people doing real things, guys that are making stuff, creative thinkers, adventurers, whatever.”&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The magazine was initially planned to be published on a bi-annual schedule,&lt;ref name="adnews.com.au"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.adnews.com.au/adnews/frankie-launches-smith-journal-in-a-leap-of-faith|title=Frankie launches Smith Journal in a leap of faith – AdNews|access-date=2018-01-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; but adopted a quarterly publishing schedule following its positive reception.

Similar to ''frankie,'' the magazine is printed on premium matte paper stock, and marketed as a "bespoke"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://theconversation.com/why-the-saturday-papers-design-breeds-disappointment-24198|title=Why The Saturday Paper's design breeds disappointment|last=Sadokierski|first=Zoe|work=The Conversation|access-date=2018-01-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; title suitable as both a casual read and coffee table magazine.

''Smith Journal'' is owned and published by niche publisher Morrison Media, parent owners of Frankie Press who also publish ''frankie'' magazine.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Morrison Media moved production of its titles to [[Melbourne]] in February 2014 when it closed its [[Queensland]] based offices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://mumbrella.com.au/frankie-press-co-founders-depart-204965|title=Frankie Press co-founders depart as Morrison Media moves sales hub to Melbourne  – Mumbrella|date=7 February 2014|work=Mumbrella|access-date=2018-01-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, Morrison Media was acquired by Pacific Star Network in November 2014 for $10m AUD.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://mumbrella.com.au/frankie-publisher-morrison-media-bought-10m-deal-262164|title=Frankie publisher Morrison Media bought out in $10m deal – Mumbrella|date=12 November 2014|work=Mumbrella|access-date=2018-01-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Smith Journal's'' name is derived from the titles used for professional [[Writer|wordsmiths]] or [[blacksmith]]s; traditional artisans and craftsmen that embody the down-to-earth quality the magazine attempts to emulate.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.scout.com.au/Blog/Smith-Journal---a-smart-new-publication-from-Frankie-Magazine|title=Smith Journal:  a smart new publication from Frankie Magazine|work=Scout|access-date=2018-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Content ==
The magazine's somewhat niche content and minimalistic approach to topics is a direct response to the salacious "lad mags" of the magazine industry such as ''[[FHM]]'' and ''[[Zoo Weekly]].'' At the time of ''Smith Journal's'' launch, the men's magazine market largely consisted of [[Popular culture|populist]] focused titles with a very broad target audience such as ''[[Men's Health]]'', or hobby-specific titles dedicated to a singular topic. Instead of attempting to engage as many readers as possible through glossy pages filled with current events topics, the editors of ''Smith Journal'' felt that there was a "gap in the market for guys who felt that their magazines hadn't grown or changed with them."&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/comment/from-zoo-to-smith-journal-are-men-finally-choosing-brains-over-boobs-20140619-zsf9r.html|title=From Zoo to Smith Journal: Are men finally choosing brains over boobs?|last=Watson|first=Meg|date=28 June 2014|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|access-date=2018-01-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the founding editor Nadia Saccardo, the magazine was not created with an emphasis on a specific gender, but was instead focused on "unexpected, accessible storytelling coupled with great photography and illustration."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Many of the articles focus on topics and individuals related to history, photography, art and design. Volume 25 profiles photographer Daniel George, whose portfolio consists of household items used for [[target practice]]; an article discussing the cultural re-evaluation of [[Glam metal|1980s hair metal]] music; and an interview with former [[NASA]] scientist Robert Lang who now designs [[origami]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.smithjournal.com.au/this-volume|title=Volume 25|date=30 January 2018|access-date=2018-01-30|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180130074538/http://www.smithjournal.com.au/this-volume|archivedate=30 January 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previous issues have also included interviews with American musician [[Henry Rollins]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.smithjournal.com.au/past-volumes/2686-smith-journal-volume-20|title=Volume 20|website=www.smithjournal.com.au|language=en-gb|access-date=2018-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; and professional safe-cracker [[Jeff Sitar]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.smithjournal.com.au/past-volumes/2489-smith-journal-volume-17|title=Volume Seventeen|website=www.smithjournal.com.au|language=en-gb|access-date=2018-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; an historical article on Soviet rocket architect [[Galina Balashova]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.smithjournal.com.au/past-volumes/2701-volume-nineteen|title=Volume Nineteen|website=www.smithjournal.com.au|language=en-gb|access-date=2018-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Brazil's illegal [[hot air balloon]] subculture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.smithjournal.com.au/past-volumes/2385-volume-sixteen|title=Volume Sixteen|website=www.smithjournal.com.au|language=en-gb|access-date=2018-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stylistic design of the magazine makes use of a large amount of white space and very [[Minimalism (disambiguation)|minimalistic]] photographs and illustrations with text pairings. Many articles are presented on a stark white background, some without a headline or photo to accompany it. A number of photographs are presented on a [[two-page spread]]. All of the photographs adhere to a similar [[Image editing|editing]] style which includes faded blacks to complement the matte paper they are printed on.

Issues will often include tear-out posters of illustrations or diagrams. For example, Volume 25 features an illustrated diagram of the [[Lunar calendar|2018 lunar calendar]], and Volume 18 included a twenty-sided [[icosahedron]] globe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.smithjournal.com.au/past-volumes/2468-smith-journal-volume-18|title=Volume Eighteen|website=www.smithjournal.com.au|language=en-gb|access-date=2018-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These content and design choices are intentionally similar in style to ''[[Frankie (magazine)|frankie]],'' another Frankie Press publication. Editor-at-Large Louise Bannister stated that "they're from the same family – lots of white space…but the treatment of pictures and text is a little different."&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.broadsheet.com.au/melbourne/art-and-design/article/frankies-mens-spin-smith-journal-hits-stands|title=Frankie's Men's Spin-Off, Smith Journal, Hits The Stands|work=Broadsheet|access-date=2018-01-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; During its initial creation, ''Smith Journal'' was designed by ''frankie'' magazine's Creative Director, Lara Burke, with additional input from ''frankie's'' editor, Jo Walker and Senior Contributor, Benjamin Walker.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; However, Bannister was quick to point out that despite the similarities, "Smith is its own thing."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Launch ==
The first issue of ''Smith Journal'' was published in Australia on 5 September 2011. Frankie Press circulated 20,000 copies&lt;ref name="adnews.com.au"/&gt; of the first issue which contained 140 pages.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

When the magazine first launched in September 2011, it was during a period when a significantly large number of men's magazines were declining in sales and reader numbers. For example, ''FHM'' had posted a 20 percent drop from 2010 to 2011 to reach a record low of 40,000 circulated copies in Australia, and ''Zoo Weekly'' had dropped 18 percent to 83,000 circulated copies.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/national/size-doesnt-matter-in-a-shrinking-market-mens-magazines-try-new-models-to-stay-on-top-20110813-1is6i.html|title=Size doesn't matter. In a shrinking market, men's magazines try new models to stay on top|last=Lallo|first=Michael|date=14 August 2011|work=The Age|access-date=2018-01-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other men's titles such as ''Alpha, Sport &amp; Style,'' and ''Ralph'' all folded in the same span of time.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;'' ''

In response to the decision to launch a new men's magazine when a large number of others were closing, then editorial director Louise Bannister suggested ''Smith Journal''  was not intended to appeal to a mass audience, but instead to a smaller group of people interested in "something they can't get on the internet."&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

== Readership ==
''Smith Journal's'' readers are predominantly male, however, the magazine also holds a fairly sizable female reader base (70% male, 30% female).&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.smithjournal.com.au/media-kit|title=Media Kit|work=smithjournal.com.au|access-date=2018-01-30|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; The magazine's media kit states that 58% of its readers are between 25–44 years old, and that 70% are university educated or are currently studying.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Former editor Nadia Saccardo described the magazine's reader as curious and open-minded and that the content was designed to attract readers "who feel like they have been ignored, or would not traditionally pick up magazines."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Editor-at-Large Rick Bannister elaborated on this statement by describing the magazine's average reader as someone who is creative and interested in reviving old traditions such as "brewing, or making furniture, or restoring bikes."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Besides the quarterly issue, the magazine also features an online presence through its website ''smithjournal.com.au.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://smithjournal.com.au/|title=Australian Magazine in Blog Form {{!}} Smith Journal|website=smithjournal.com.au|language=en-gb|access-date=2018-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The website includes original articles and weekly blog posts not found in the magazine that cover a wider range of subjects and topics than the magazine usually focuses on. The website receives an average number of 19,900 unique visitors (six-month average), and 41,150+ average page views per month (media kit). ''Smith Journal'' also has an online shop where visitors can purchase individual copies (for domestic or international shipping), issues of the digital magazine, as well as past copies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.frankiepress.com.au/shop/|title=buy frankie magazine &amp; Smith Journal magazine {{!}} frankie press|website=www.frankiepress.com.au|language=en|access-date=2018-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3051">The '''Society of Gilders''' (SoG) is an international [[non-profit organization]] dedicated to the practice and preservation of the art of using [[gold]] and [[metal leaf]]. SoG offers technical help for gilders, restorers, conservators, craftsmen, and all those interested in the [[gilding]] arts. Classes and conferences held by SoG bring gilders together from around the globe to learn, discuss and share.

Membership is open to any interested individual, institution or corporation.

==Mission==
The Society of Gilders is a non-profit [[educational organization]] devoted to the art and craft of gilding. The society's mission is to preserve traditional gilding skills and techniques, and to promote the highest standards in the practice of gilding.

==History==
A landmark event in the world of gilding took place at the [[Newark Museum]] in [[New Jersey]] during the winter of 1986. While attending a week-long gilding course hosted by the museum’s Arts Workshop, gilders met and exchanged gilding recipes, anecdotes, techniques and ethical concerns. The participants expressed a unanimous desire to extend this collaboration into an organization patterned after the ancient craftsmen’s guilds. Originally called the Guild of Gilders, the group changed their name to the Society of Gilders, welcoming fellow gilders and anyone interested in the art of gilding to join their ranks.

Today the Society of Gilders continues to grow, and the Regional Education Program continues to teach the art of gilding in many disciplines. Conferences have been held in [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]], [[South Carolina]] (2000), [[Washington DC]] (2001, 2003, 2006 and 2008), and [[New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]] (2007 to 2013).

'''Spiderwoman Theater''' is an American, [[indigenous peoples|Indigenous]] women's [[Performance art|performance troupe]] that blends traditional art forms with Western theater. Their mission was to present exceptional theater performance, and to provide theatrical training and education in an urban Indigenous performance practice. The theater sprung out of the [[feminist movement]] in the 1970s. They questioned gender roles, cultural stereotypes, sexual and economic oppression.&lt;ref name="mysite"&gt;{{cite web |title=About Spiderwoman Theater |url=https://www.spiderwomantheater.org/blank-mpvle |website=Spiderwoman Theater |accessdate=24 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was founded in 1976, the core of the group is formed by sisters Muriel Miguel, Gloria Miguel, and Lisa Mayo. It was the first [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] women's theater troupe and is named after the Spiderwoman deity from [[Hopi mythology]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==History==
Muriel Miguel developed a piece with [[Lois Weaver]] based on three stories of the Hopi goddess [[Spider Grandmother|Spiderwoman]] teaching people how to weave. Miguel's sisters, Lisa Mayo and Gloria Miguel, joined the group.&lt;ref name="AWSDTC"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fliotsos|first1=Anne|last2=Vierow|first2=Wendy|chapter=Muriel Miguel|title=American Women Stage Directors of the Twentieth Century|date=2008|publisher=University of Illinois Press|location=Urbana|isbn=0-252-03226-8|pages=288–293|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EGOBtC_Jum0C&amp;lpg=PA290&amp;dq=%22spiderwoman%20theater%22&amp;pg=PA289}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spiderwoman Theater was founded in 1976&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women Artists of Color: A Bio-Critical Sourcebook to 20th Century Artists in the Americas|last=Farris|first=Phoebe|publisher=Greenwood Press|year=1999|isbn=0-313-30374-6|location=Westport, CT|pages=93}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the group premiered their first work, ''Women in Violence'', at Washington Square Methodist Church. The play combined the actors' stories of violence, contrasting serious subject matter with slapstick and sexual humor. For the piece they created a simple lighting design and a backdrop made out of Native American quilts. They toured the play in the United States and Europe. At a theatre in [[Nancy, France]], the women refused to sweep their performance space before their show.  Hecklers gathered at the performance, upset that a male producer had to sweep the floor. Organizers of a later performance in [[Bologna, Italy]] cancelled it for fear of riots.&lt;ref name="AWSDTC"/&gt;

Spiderwoman Theater debuted their second play, ''The Lysistrata Numbah!'', in 1977. The production melded [[Aristophanes]]' ''[[Lysistrata]]'' with group members' stories.&lt;ref name="AWSDTC"/&gt;

Schisms developed in the group that led to the theater dividing in two in 1981. The offshoot lesbian performance troupe [[Split Britches]] included Lois Weaver, [[Peggy Shaw]], and [[Deb Margolin]].&lt;ref name="Peterson (1997)"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Peterson|first1=Jane T.|last2=Bennett|first2=Suzanne|title=Women Playwrights of Diversity: A Bio-bibliographical Sourcebook|date=1997|publisher=Greenwood Press|location=Westport, Connecticut|isbn=0-313-29179-9|pages=318–319|url=https://books.google.com.mx/books?id=rE1TrrghzLIC&amp;lpg}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Spiderwoman Theater continued on with the three sisters and shifted its focus to Native American issues that year with the play ''Sun, Moon and Feather''.&lt;ref name="AWSDTC"/&gt;
Spiderwoman Theater's ''Winnetou's Snake Oil Show from Wigwam City'' is a satire of the European and particularly [[Native American hobbyism in Germany|German fascination with Native Americans]]. The play parodies the characters of dime-store novelist [[Karl May]], [[New Age]]ism, and individuals who pretend to be Native American. The play includes a phony shaman workshop where white people are transformed into Indians for a weekend for $3000.&lt;ref name="W&amp;P"/&gt; According to the troupe, it was an act of resistance meant to reclaim their identity as real Native Americans.&lt;ref&gt;Spiderwoman Theatre (1999).

Performance Documentation of the pieces "Women In Violence" (1976) and "Lysistrata Numbah!" (1977) were included in the WACK! Art and Feminist Revolution Exhibition, organized by Cornelia Butler and presented at The Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles, March 4-July 16, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/421897194|title=Wack! : Art and the feminist revolution : exposition présentée à Los Angeles, the Museum of Contemporary Art, du 4 mars au 16 juillet 2007|last=H.|first=Butler, Cornelia|last2=Calif.)|first2=Museum of contemporary art (Los Angeles,|date=2007-01-01|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=0914357999|oclc=421897194}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Spiderwoman founder Muriel Miguel was the subject about a short documentary by [[Theatre Communications Group]] in a series about theatre companies about people of color.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tcg.org/TheNext50Years/EDIInitiative/Legacy/News/MurielMiguelScreening.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, a repository for Spiderwoman Theater, the [[Native American Women Playwrights Archive]] (NAWPA), was created. It contains promotional and personal documents associated with the theater troupe and also holds a collection of manuscripts and related items pertaining to Native American women in theater.

== Founders ==
Spiderwoman Theater was founded by sisters Muriel, Gloria Miguel and Lisa Mayo (born Elizabeth Miguel). They are of Kuna and Rappahannock ancestry and were born and grew up in Brooklyn, New York. The sisters' mother and maternal grandmother also grew up in Brooklyn, but their father, a Kuna Indian, was a born in the San Blas Islands near Panama. According to Muriel, their father struggled to provide for his family via conventional means, and so the family would perform dances and snake oil shows for money. The three sisters were embarrassed by these performances and decided they would rather associate with more professional types of theater as opposed to being "spectacles of cliché." &lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://spec.lib.miamioh.edu/home/nawpa-spiderwoman-theater/|title=NAWPA: Spiderwoman Theater {{!}} Miami University Libraries                                           Steward &amp; Sustain Department|website=spec.lib.miamioh.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Muriel Miguel is a founder of the Native American Theatre Ensemble at [[La MaMa Experimental Theatre Club|La MaMa]].&lt;ref name="AWSDTC" /&gt; She is a choreographer, play writer, actor, educator, and [[Two-spirit]] woman. She gathered a diverse group of women including both of her sisters Gloria Miguel and Lisa Mayo, thus creating the Spiderwoman theater.&lt;ref name="mysite"/&gt; She also taught theater at Bard College. In addition to Spiderwoman Theater, she was a founding member of Joseph Chaikin's Open Theater.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ipl.org/div/natam/bin/browse.pl/A504|title=Muriel Miguel on Native American Authors|last=ipl2|website=www.ipl.org|access-date=2018-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gloria Miguel studied drama at Oberlin College.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; She has worked extensively in television and theater with the Spiderwoman, she has toured throughout New Zealand, Australia and Europe. She was a drama consultant for the Minnesota Native American AIDS, she was also a drama teacher at the YMCA eastern district in Brooklyn.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.spiderwomantheater.org/copy-of-muriel-miguel|title=About Muriel Miguel|website=|language=en|access-date=2018-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; she is also the mother of [[Monique Mojica]], another playwright and actress.

Lisa Mayo (1924-2013) was trained as a mezzo-soprano at the New York School of Music. Mayo also studied dance and musical comedy.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; She has written and performed in more than 20 plays that were produced by The Spiderwoman Theater, and toured New Zealand, Europe, Australia, China, United States and throughout Canada. She has created two one-woman shows ''The Pause That Refreshes'' and ''My Sister Ate Dirt.'' Mayo contributed to the Minnesota Native American AIDS by teaching theater crafts to young people. She served on the Board of Directors of [https://aich.org/ The American Indian Community House] from 1998-2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=About Gloria Miguel |url=https://www.spiderwomantheater.org/copy-of-gloria-miguel |website=Spiderwoman Theater |accessdate=24 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its headquarters were in the [[16th arrondissement of Paris|16th arrondissement]] of [[Paris]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.technip.com/sites/default/files/technip/page/attachments/Plan_acces_TCS.pdf Access map]." Technip. Retrieved on {{date|26|December |2012}}. "89 avenue de la Grande Armée Paris 16"&lt;/ref&gt; It has about 38,000 employees and operates in 48 countries.

== Overview ==
TECHNIP is primarily in the energy business and is active in three business segments, namely [[Subsea]], [[Offshore (hydrocarbons)|Offshore]] &amp; [[Onshore (hydrocarbons)|Onshore]]. It has around 38,000 employees and operates in 48 countries. It owns a fleet of 21 vessels in operation with 6 more under construction. As of the end of 2014, while the operating income of Technip Group from recurring activities stood at ~ Euros 825 million, the total revenues stood at more than Euros 10.7 billion.&lt;ref name="2014_results"&gt;[http://www.technip.com/sites/default/files/technip/fields/press/attachments/pr_fr_4qfy14_final.pdf Technip full Year 2014 results], sur "&lt;Technip.com&gt;".&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Technip HQ.jpg|thumb|Technip head office, 89 avenue de la Grande-Armée, Paris 16th arr.]]
Technip was established in 1958 by IFP, [[Institut français du pétrole]], as Compagnie française d'études et de construction Technip.

In the 1960s, the company completed its first international projects in Africa and Asia. In the 1970s Technip became an international group with the acquisition of an office in Rome and the creation of Technip Geoproduction, a subsidiary specialized in hydrocarbon field equipment. During this period, Coflexip – a firm specialized in the design, manufacture and supply of flexible subsea flowlines – was created by the [[French Institute of Petroleum|IFP]] (French Petroleum Institute) and opened a flexible flowline manufacturing plant in Le Trait, France, as well as offices in [[Houston]], [[Aberdeen]] and [[Rio de Janeiro]].

In the 1980s Technip opened operating centers in Kuala Lumpur and Abu Dhabi. Coflexip opened a second flowline manufacturing plant in Brazil and branched out into the manufacture of umbilicals with the establishment of the Duco plant in Newcastle, UK.

Coflexip acquired Stena Offshore while Technip acquired several companies with strong technological expertise: ''Speichim'', ''Krebs'' and ''KTI''. Already established in the United States, KTI enabled Technip to set up in [[North America]]. Coflexip established a presence in Australia and acquired the Norwegian company Stena Offshore.

In the 2000s, Technip merged with Coflexip, which had just acquired Aker Maritime's Deepwater Division. The unified group is now one of the top five companies worldwide in engineering, technology and services for the energy industry. Many major contracts are signed, notably in the Middle East in the liquefied natural gas (LNG), ethylene and refining sectors.

In 2010 three major assets came into operation: the Technip fleet expanded to 17 vessels with the addition of the Apache II, one of the most advanced pipelay vessels in the industry, and the Skandi Vitoria, a Brazilian-flagged vessel dedicated to the pre-salt market. Asiaflex Products, the Group’s third flexible pipe production plant, located in Tanjung Langsat, Malaysia was inaugurated.

In 2011, Technip acquired Global Industries, substantially expanding its addressable market in subsea.

In 2012 Technip acquired [[Stone &amp; Webster|Stone &amp; Webster Process Technologies]] and associated oil and gas engineering capabilities from [[The Shaw Group]].

In 2017, FMC Technologies Inc. and French oil-services Technip SA agreed to merge, forming a significant new player in an energy industry racked by a nearly two-year slump in crude prices.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fuelfix.com/blog/2017/01/17/technipfmc-launches-as-newly-merged-offshore-giant/|title=TechnipFMC launches as newly merged offshore giant {{!}} Fuel Fix|website=fuelfix.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The all-share deal would result in a new company named [[TechnipFMC]] with a market value of about $13 billion.

TechnipFMC has three [[headquarters]] in [[Houston]], [[Paris]] and [[London]] under new Houston-based CEO Doug Pferdehirt, who worked as FMC’s [[chief operating officer]]. Former Technip chairman and CEO Thierry Pilenko is the new executive chairman.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Listings ==
In the 1990s Technip was listed on the [[Paris Stock Exchange]] and Coflexip on the [[New York Stock Exchange]]. Technip was included in the CAC40 French benchmark index in September 2009.

== Controversies ==
In June 2010 Technip S.A. agreed to pay a $338 million criminal penalty to resolve charges related to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) for its participation in a decade-long scheme to bribe Nigerian government officials to obtain engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) contracts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703964104575334962621807130 | title=France's Technip Settles U.S. Bribery Charges | accessdate=18 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the US Securities &amp; Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a lawsuit in the federal Southern District of New York alleging insider trading.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2011-09-20/sec-alleges-insider-trading-in-global-industries-technip-deal | title=Bloomberg Business: SEC Alleges Insider Trading | accessdate=18 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The activities of the TMG include trade in [[license]]s, investments in television and radio stations and distribution and production of [[television film]]s and [[film|movies]]. TMG has one of the largest film libraries in Europe.{{cn|date=June 2018}}

== History ==
{{refimprove-section|date=June 2018}}
[[File:Tmg-haus.jpg|thumb|Headquarters of TMG in Munich]]
The ''Tele München GmbH'' was founded on April 27, 1970 by author and producer [[Walter Ulbrich]]. It was purchased in 1977 by Herbert Kloiber and his business partner Fritz Buttenstedt. In 1980 the ''[[Concorde Filmverleih]]'' (Concorde film distribution) was founded and a year later, in 1981, the company acquired along with the cinema operator Hans-Joachim Flebbe several movie theaters in [[Hamburg]], [[Berlin]] and [[Braunschweig]].

1985 TMG was partner at the television station [[Sat.1]], but after a year sold its shares, and started the TV station ''musicbox''. In the same year TMG took over the Munich private radio station ''Radio Xanadu'', which was later renamed to [[NRJ Group|Radio Energy]].

In 1987, [[Silvio Berlusconi]]’s company [[Fininvest]] acquired 50 percent of ''musicbox''. This was the basis for the channel [[Tele 5]]. In 1988, [[Axel Springer SE|Axel Springer Publishing House]] and [[RTL Group|CLT]] became partner at TMG. In 1989, 50 percent from the company  were sold to [[American Broadcasting Company|Capital Cities / ABC]].

1991 TMG sold its shares in Tele 5 to the Axel Springer Publishing House and in 1992 founded, together with CLT, [[Bertelsmann]], [[Bauer Media Group]] and [[The Walt Disney Company]], the TV channel [[RTL II]]. In 1995, the television station [[Tm3]] was founded by TMG and the Bauer Media Group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://info.rtl2.de/unternehmen/gesellschafterstruktur | title=Gesellschafterstruktur | author= | date= | website= | publisher=RTL II | language=German | accessdate=5 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, Herbert Kloiber bought back the TMG shares from Capital Cities / ABC, and took over the shares of Bauer Media Group on Tm3. In 1997, TMG participated in the Hungarian private broadcaster [[TV2 (Hungary)|TV2]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://variety.com/2001/tv/news/tele-munchen-revs-hit-194-mil-on-record-sales-1117796630/ | title=Tele Munchen revs hit $194 mil on record sales | author=Ed Meza | date=6 April 2001 | website= | publisher=Variety | language= | accessdate=5 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, [[Rupert Murdoch]]'s company [[News Corporation]] took over 66 percent of  Tm3 and two years later, in 2000, took over Tm3 completely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= https://www.handelsblatt.com/archiv/kloiber-plant-neuen-sender-tele-muenchen-gruppe-mit-rekordgewinn-nach-tm3-verkauf/2055474.html | title= Tele-München-Gruppe mit Rekordgewinn nach tm3-Verkauf | author= | date=5 April 2001 | website= | publisher=Handelsblatt | language=German | accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 April 2002, the channel Tele 5 was restarted by TMG.

'''''The St. Cecilia Altarpiece''''' is an [[oil painting]] by Italian [[High Renaissance]] painter [[Raphael]]. Completed in his later years, around 1516-1517, the painting depicts [[Saint Cecilia]], the [[patron saint]] of musicians and [[Church music]], listening to a choir of angels in the company of [[Paul of Tarsus|St. Paul]], [[John the Apostle|St. John the Evangelist]], [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]] and [[Mary Magdalene]]. Commissioned for a church in [[Bologna]], the painting now hangs there in the [[Pinacoteca Nazionale (Bologna)|Pinacoteca Nazionale]], or National Painting Gallery.  According to Vasari the musical instruments strewn about Cecilia's feet were not painted by Raphael, but by his student, [[Giovanni da Udine]].&lt;ref&gt;G. Vasari, ''Le vite de' piu eccellenti pittori, scultori ed architettori,'' ed. G. Milanesi, Milan, 1906, VI, 551.  Late in his career Raphael typically assigned portions of his works to assistants.  On this point see Andrea Emiliani," L'estasi di Santa Cecilia," in ''L'estasi di Santa Cecilia di Raffaello da Urbino nella Pinacoteca Nazionale di Bologna,'' ed. Andrea Emiliani, Bologna: Alfa, 1983, i-xciii,&lt;/ref&gt;

English [[Romantic poet]] [[Percy Bysshe Shelley|Percy Shelley]] described the painting as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The central figure, St. Cecilia, seems rapt in such inspiration as produced her image in the painter's mind; her deep, dark, eloquent eyes lifted up; her chestnut hair flung back from her forehead — she holds an organ in her hands — her countenance, as it were, calmed by the depth of its passion and rapture, and penetrated throughout with the warm and radiant light of life. She is listening to the music of heaven, and, as I imagine, has just ceased to sing, for the four figures that surround her evidently point, by their attitudes, towards her; particularly St. John, who, with a tender yet impassioned gesture, bends his countenance towards her, languid with the depth of emotion. At her feet lie various instruments of music, broken and unstrung.&lt;ref&gt;''Letters from Italy''; quoted in Singleton (1899), p. 288.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==History==
The altarpiece was commissioned for a chapel dedicated to St. Cecilia at the Augustinian church of [[San Giovanni in Monte]] in Bologna. According to [[Vasari]] the work was commissioned by [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] [[Lorenzo Pucci]] in 1513.&lt;ref&gt;Vasari, IV, 349, and III, 545; Vasari (1987), 303-304; Champlin and Perkins (1913), 261.  Pucci family documents ascribe the commission to Cardinal Lorenzo's nephew, Antonio, a canon of Florence Cathedral.  O. Pucci, "La santa Cecilia di Raffaello d'Urbino," ''Rivista Fiorentina'', I, June, 1908, 6-7.&lt;/ref&gt; Given the extraordinary popularity of the painter at this time in his career, it is likely that only such a highly placed church authority could have had any hope of hiring him.  The patron of the chapel itself, however, was Elena Duglioli dall'Olio, an aristocratic Bolognese woman who would later be beatified for her piety.  She was a close friend of Antonio Pucci, Cardinal Lorenzo's nephew, and most art historians today agree that the Pucci must have served as her agents and advisers with Raphael and that the painting was more likely commissioned for her around 1516, when construction on the chapel was completed.&lt;ref&gt;Stanislaw Mossakowski, "Raphael's ''St. Cecilia.'' An Iconographical Study," ''Zeitschrift für Kunstgeschichte,'' 31 (1968), 1-2; Gabriella Zarri, "L'altra Cecilia: Elena Duglioli dall'Olio (1472-1520)," in ''La Santa Cecilia di Raffaello: Indagini per un dipinto,'' ed. Andrea Emiliani (Bologna: Alfa, 1983), 81-118; Carla Bernardini, "Antefatti Bolognese: Una traccia," in ''L'estasi di Santa Cecilia di Raffaello da Urbino nella Pinacoteca Nazionale di Bologna,'' ed. Andrea Emiliani, Bologna: Alfa, 1983, 2-19. Historian [[Eugène Müntz]] suggested in his 1882 biography of the artist that Elena Duglioni was inspired to build a chapel by a vision, but conveyed her inspiration to her kinsman [[Antonio Pucci (cardinal)|Antonio Pucci]], who footed the bill for the chapel and convinced his uncle Lorenzo to commission the work. Müntz (1882), 525.&lt;/ref&gt; Duglioli had a particular devotion to the cult of St. Cecilia and had been given a relic (her knucklebone) by the papal legate to Bologna, [[Francesco Adiosi|Cardinal Francesco Alidosi]].  She struggled to live a chaste life in emulation of the early Christian saint and persuaded her husband not to consummate their marriage.&lt;ref&gt;Mossakowski, 2; Roger Jones and Nicholas Penny, ''Raphael,'' New Haven:  Yale University Press, 1983, 146.&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting was looted to [[Paris]] in 1798.&lt;ref&gt;Champlin and Perkins (1913), 261.&lt;/ref&gt; While there, it was [[Transfer of panel paintings|transferred to canvas]]. In 1815, the painting was returned to Bologna where, after cleaning, and was hung in the [[Pinacoteca Nazionale di Bologna]]. The painting's condition is poor, as it has been damaged by repainting over the years.

==Iconography==
St. Cecilia's companions are identified in part by their attributes. Immediately to her right, John the Evangelist has an eagle, his usual symbol,&lt;ref&gt;Nici (2008), 155.&lt;/ref&gt; peeking out around his robes. Beside him, Paul leans on the sword with which he had come to be identified in medieval art.&lt;ref&gt;Lowrie (2007), 148-149.&lt;/ref&gt; Augustine of Hippo holds his [[crosier]]. Mary Magdalene holds the alabaster jar by which she is most commonly identified.&lt;ref&gt;Gardner (2007), 209.&lt;/ref&gt;

The iconography of the altarpiece is unusual in that rather than portraying a figure or figures to be worshipped, it represents the act of worship itself. Each of the saints was associated with visions - as was Elena Duglioni herself - and the celestial choir that opens above the saints' heads is closely associated with the patron's own devotions, in which music was an important element.&lt;ref&gt;Mossakowski, 3-4; Jones and Penny, 146; Wolfgang Osthoff, "Raffael und die Musik", in ''Raffael in seiner Zeit'', ed. Volker Hoffman
Nurnberg: Verlag Hans Carl, 1987, 155-88.&lt;/ref&gt;  Cecilia was associated with music from the Middle Ages,&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Connolly, ''Mourning into Joy:  Music, Raphael, and St. Cecilia'', New Haven:  Yale University Press, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; but the broken instruments here appear to refer to the abandonment of earthly pleasures that resulted from Cecilia's devotion to the sacred.  In this painting she personifies religious music as a route to union with God.&lt;ref&gt;Mossakowski, 5-6, suggests the broken instruments represent "the secular music of the wedding rejected by St. Cecilia."  He goes on to note that instrumental music had, since the time of the Greeks, been less esteemed than vocal music.&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting further celebrates the theme of chastity.  St. Cecilia's simple belt is a traditional Renaissance symbol for chastity;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=E.|last= Wind|title= Pagan Mysteries in the Renaissance|location= New York City|year= 1958|page= 123, note 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; John the Evangelist was the patron saint of virginity; and Paul praised celibacy in I Corinthians.  Thus the painting's iconography is closely tied to the life of the patron on many levels.&lt;ref&gt;Mossakowski further analyzes the painting as an expression of erudite [[Humanism in Italy|humanist]] ideas,&lt;/ref&gt;

There is an engraving of the painting by [[Marcantonio Raimondi]]: it differs significantly from the work, and some scholars have suggested that it reflects a lost sketch for the altarpiece.&lt;ref&gt;Müntz (1882), p. 529.&lt;/ref&gt; In it Raphael depicted the angels with instruments as well — harp, triangle and violin — and the figures are in very different poses. Augustine (wearing his [[mitre]]) and Paul look downward; John looks out towards the viewer; the Magdalene looks upward to the angelic host, as Cecilia does.  Raimondi's engravings are frequently known to alter Raphael's works, however, so it is not impossible that it represents a free variant of the finished altarpiece rather than a copy of a sketch of Raphael's initial intentions.&lt;ref&gt;P. Kristeller, "Marc-Antonios Beziehungen zu Raffael",  ''Jahrbuch der Preussischen Kunstsammlungen'', XXVIII (1907), 219-221, 228; M. Pittaluga, ''L'incisione italiana nel Cinquecento,'' 1928, pp. 144, 197.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Toreby Church''' is the parish church of [[Toreby]] on the [[Denmark|Danish]] island of [[Lolland]]. It is an unusually large red-brick [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] building, the [[nave]] and [[chancel]] having been extended in the [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] period with a [[sacristy]] and lateral [[aisle]]. The tower is late Romanesque. There are [[fresco]]s from c. 1400 in the sacristy. The carved [[pulpit]] (1645) is the work of  [[Jørgen Ringnis]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Kunst_og_kultur/Arkitektur/Danske_kirker_T-T%C3%A5/Toreby_Kirke "Torby Kirke], ''Den Store Danske''. {{da icon}} Retrieved 27 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Dedicated to [[Michael (archangel)|St Michael]], the church was the property of the Crown in the [[Middle Ages]] and remained so after the [[Reformation in Denmark–Norway and Holstein|Reformation]]. In 1726, it was sold by auction to Chamberlain [[Christian Carl Gabel]] together with the [[Fuglsang Manor|Fuglsang]] and Priorskov estates. The Toreby market was moved to [[Sakskøbing]] in 1550.&lt;ref name=natmus&gt;[http://danmarkskirker.natmus.dk/uploads/tx_tcchurchsearch/Maribo_1001-1024.pdf Kirsten Weber-Andersen, Otto Norn, Aage Roussell, Gertrud Købke Knudsen, "Tingsted Kirke"], ''Danmarks kirker: Maribo amt, Volume 8'', 1951, Nationalmuseet, pages 1001-1024. {{da icon}} Retrieved 28 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architecture==
Built c. 1200, Toreby is one of the largest churches in the area. Built of brick with fieldstone foundations, it consists of a nave, two lateral aisles, a [[chancel]], a sacristy and a tower. The nave and part of the chancel remain from the original Romanesque building. Traces of the old [[apse]], removed in the Gothic period, can still be seen. The tower was constructed in late Gothic times, shortly after the church was built. The sacristy to the north of the chancel was built at the beginning of the 14th century. The aisles were added in the Gothic period, first the one on the northern side, then the one to the south. The Late-Gothic porch has been altered several times.&lt;ref name=nk&gt;[http://www.nordenskirker.dk/Tidligere/Toreby_kirke/Toreby_kirke.htm "Toreby kirke"], ''Nordens Kirker''. {{da icon}} Retrieved 28 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=natmus/&gt;

==Interior and fittings==
[[File:Nordenskirker Toreby08.jpg|thumb|Interior with Ringnis' pulpit]]
The chancel originally had a flat wooden ceiling, the vaulting was added later. Six-ribbed vaults were also added to the nave and the northern aisle. A fresco of a bassoon-playing angel was found on the chancel arch, probably part of a painting of the [[Last Judgment]].&lt;ref name=nk/&gt;

The [[altarpiece]] consists of a painting of the [[Entombment of Christ]], copied from [[Pietro Perugino]]'s original by [[Albert Küchler]] in 1849. The former altarpiece now stands at the west end of the church. The [[pulpit]] (1645) in the [[auricular style]] is the work of woodcarver [[Jørgen Ringnis]]. The north aisle contains a crucifix from c. 1250.&lt;ref name=nk/&gt;

==Frescos==
The frescos on the sacristy [[Vault (architecture)|vault]] were discovered in 1904 and restored in 1920. Probably dating from the early 14th century, they depict the Enthroned Christ, two angels, [[John the Baptist]] with the lamb, and the prophets [[Zechariah (Hebrew prophet)|Zechariah]] and [[Jeremiah]]. Traces of other figures can also be seen including Michael fighting the dragon, the [[Judgment of Solomon]] and the [[Binding of Isaac|Sacrifice of Isaac]]. There are also traces of frescos of [[Moses]], including [[Burning bush|Moses and the Burning Bush]].&lt;ref name=natmus/&gt;

[[File:Francesco Porzio, Monumento alla difesa di Casale, Piazza Castello, Casale Monferrato (Ian Spackman 199xC n25).jpg|thumb|200px|Bronze of a young female warrior in [[Lombards|Lombard]] costume. Francesco Porzio, ''Monumento alla difesa di Casale'', 1897]]

A '''virago''' is a woman who demonstrates exemplary and heroic qualities. The word comes from the Latin word ''virāgō'' (([[genitive case|genitive]] virāginis) meaning variously 'a man-like, vigorous, heroic maiden, a female warrior, heroine..'&lt;ref&gt;{{L&amp;S|virago|virāgō|ref}}&lt;/ref&gt; from ''vir'' meaning 'man' (cf. [[virile]] and [[virtue]]) to which the suffix ''-āgō '' is added, a suffix that creates a new noun of the [[Third declension|third declension]] with feminine [[grammatical gender]].

The word ''virago'' has almost always had an association with cultural [[gender role|gender transgression]]. A virago, of whatever excellence, was still identified by her gender. There are recorded instances of viragos (such as [[Joan of Arc]]) fighting battles, wearing men's clothing, or receiving the [[tonsure]].&lt;ref&gt;Jane Tibbetts Schulenburg. ''Forgetful of their sex: female sanctity and society, ca. 500-1100''. University Of Chicago Press, 2001. Page 50. {{ISBN|978-0-226-74054-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''virago'' could also be used disparagingly, to imply that a virago was not excellent or heroic, but was instead violating cultural norms. Thus ''virago'' joined [[pejorative]]s such as ''[[termagant]]'',&lt;ref name=MWdict&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/virago| title=Virago| accessdate=2011-11-25| publisher=Merriam-Webster Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''mannish'', ''amazonian'' and ''[[Shrew (archetype)|shrew]]'' to demean women who acted aggressively or like men.

==History==
Historically, the concept of a virago reaches back into antiquity where [[Hellenistic philosophy]] asserted that elite and exceptionally heroic men had ''[[virtus (virtue)|virtus]]'' ({{lang-el|ἀνδρεία|andreia}}). ''Virtus'' (once again linked to ''vir'', the brave man abiding by society's highest values and ethics as opposed to ''homo'', human being) defined the traits of excellence for a man in ancient Rome (and Greece), including valor and heroism, but also morality and physical strength. Women and non-elite or unheroic men (slaves, servants, craftsmen, merchants) were considered a lesser category, and believed to be less excellent in [[Mos maiorum|Roman morality]]. A woman, however, if exceptional enough could earn the title ''virago''. In doing so, she surpassed the expectations for what was believed possible for her [[gender]], and embodied masculine-like aggression&lt;ref&gt;Virginia Blanton. ''Signs of devotion: the cult of St. Æthelthryth in medieval England, 695-1615'' Pennsylvania State Univ Pr (Trd) (April 30, 2007). Page 168. {{ISBN|978-0-271-02984-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and/or excellence. Virago, then, was a title of respect and admiration. In [[Christianity]], a [[nun]] or holy woman who had become equal in divinity to male [[monks]] through practiced [[celibacy]], exemplary religious practice and devotion, and intact [[virginity]], was considered to have surpassed the limitations of her femaleness and was called ''virago''.&lt;ref&gt;Newman, Barbara. ''From Virile Woman to Woman Christ: Studies in Medieval Religion and Literature''. University of Pennsylvania Press, 1995. Page 5. {{ISBN|978-0-8122-1545-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Laurence Lux-Sterritt. Redefining Female Religious Life: French Ursulines And English Ladies in Seventeenth-Century Catholicism. Ashgate Pub Co (January 30, 2006). Page 61. {{ISBN|978-0-7546-3716-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Firmicus Maternus describes virago as women who take on a man's character and desire intercourse with women like men.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Love Between Women: early Christian responses to female homoeroticism|last=Brooten|first=Bernadette|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|year=1996|isbn=978-0-226-07591-4|location=Chicago|pages=135}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Standard modern dictionaries define ''virago'' as either, in order of definition, (1) a "loud overbearing woman"; a "shrew".&lt;ref&gt;{Merriam-Webster's Third New International Dictionary of the English Language Unabridged, Copyright (c) 1993 Merriam-Webster, Incorporated, first definition of "virago"}&lt;/ref&gt; or (2) a woman of "great stature, strength, and courage"&lt;ref  name=MWdict /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.answers.com/topic/virago&lt;/ref&gt; Thus virago continues to be associated with both the naming of a woman who has either (1) a domineering, abrasive and spiteful manner, or (2) has risen above cultural and [[sexism|gender stereotypes]] to embody a [[virility|virile]] heroism; for example, the [[British Royal Navy]] christened at least four warships ''[[HMS Virago|Virago]]''.

==Vulgate Bible==
The [[Vulgate]] Bible, translated by [[Jerome]] and others in the 4th century C.E., was an early Latin translation of the Hebrew Bible [[Hebrew Bible|Old Testament]]. In Genesis 2:23, Jerome uses the words ''Vir'' for man and ''Virago'' for "woman" attempting to reproduce a pun on "male" and "female" (''ish'' and ''ishah'') that existed in the Hebrew text.&lt;ref&gt;Saint Jerome, Robert Hayward. ''Saint Jerome's Hebrew questions on Genesis.'' Oxford University Press, USA (August 10, 1995) Page 113. {{ISBN|978-0-19-826350-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Helen Kraus. ''Gender Issues in Ancient and Reformation Translations of Genesis 1-4.'' Oxford University Press, USA (December 17, 2011). Page 182. {{ISBN|978-0-19-960078-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Vulgate reads:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
''Dixitque Adam hoc nunc os ex ossibus meis et caro de carne mea haec vocabitur '''virago''' quoniam de viro sumpta est.''
&lt;br&gt;
"And Adam said: This now is bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh; she shall be called woman, because she was taken out of man."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Middle English poem ''[[Cursor Mundi]]'' retains the Latin name for the woman in its otherwise Middle English account of the creation:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
''Quen sco was broght be-for adam, '''Virago''' he gaf her to nam; þar for hight sco '''virago''', ffor maked of the man was sco.'' (lines 631–34)
&lt;br&gt;
"When she was brought before Adam, Virago was the name he gave to her; Therefore she is called Virago, For she was made out of the man."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
