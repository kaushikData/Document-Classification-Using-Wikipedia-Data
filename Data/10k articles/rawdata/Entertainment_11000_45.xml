[[File:Logo dotHack.svg|right|thumb|250px|''.hack'' logo]]
'''''.hack''''' (pronounced "dot-hack") is a [[Japan]]ese multimedia franchise that encompasses two projects: '''Project .hack''' and '''.hack Conglomerate'''. Both projects were primarily created and developed by [[CyberConnect2]], and published by [[Bandai]]. The series franchise revolves around an alternative history setting in the rise of the new millennium regarding the technological rise of a new version of the internet following a major global computer network disaster in the year 2005, and the mysterious events regarding the wildly popular in-universe MMORPG series ''The World''. The series is mainly followed through [[anime]] and [[video game]] installations, and has been adapted through [[manga]], [[novels]] and other related media.

== Project .hack ==
'''Project .hack''' was the first project of the ''.hack'' series. It launched in 2002 with the [[anime]] series ''[[.hack//Sign]]'' in April 2002 and the [[PlayStation 2]] game ''[[.hack (video game series)|.hack//Infection]]'' in June 2002. Project developers included [[Koichi Mashimo]] ([[Bee Train]]), [[Kazunori Itō|Kazunori Ito]] (Catfish), and [[Yoshiyuki Sadamoto]] ([[Gainax]]). Since then, Project .hack has spanned television, video games, manga, and novels. Project .hack centers mainly on the events and affairs of the prime installment of ''The World''. The franchise began internationally when Bandai announced .hack//Infection, which was released in 2003 and .hack//Sign got an English dub, which was released on [[Cartoon Network]] in the same year.  

=== Games ===
* ''[[.hack (video game series)|.hack]]'', a series of four [[PlayStation 2]] games that follow the story of the .hackers, [[Kite (.hack)|Kite]] and [[BlackRose (.hack)|BlackRose]], and their attempts to find out what caused the sudden coma of Kite's friend, Orca, and BlackRose's brother, Kazu. The four volumes, in sequence, are ''.hack//Infection'', ''.hack//Mutation'', ''.hack//Outbreak'', and ''.hack//Quarantine''.
* ''[[.hack (video game series)#.hack//frägment|.hack//frägment]]'', the first ''.hack'' [[Massively multiplayer online game|ORPG]] (online role-playing game). It was released only in Japan, and the servers have since been closed, ending all official online gameplay.
* ''.hack//Enemy'', a [[collectible card game]] created by [[Decipher Inc.]] based on the ''.hack'' series. It was discontinued after running five separate expansions between 2003 and 2005.
*''.hack//Link''

=== Anime ===
*''[[.hack//Sign]]'' is an [[anime]] television series directed by [[Kōichi Mashimo]] and produced by studio [[Bee Train]] and [[Bandai Visual]]. ''.hack//Sign'' consists of twenty six original episodes and three additional bonus episodes  released on DVD as [[original video animation]]s (OVAs). The series focuses on a [[.hack#Primary 6 Classes|Wavemaster]] (magic user) named Tsukasa, a [[player character]] of a [[virtual reality|virtual-reality]] [[massively multiplayer online role-playing game]] (MMORPG) called ''[[The World (.hack)|The World]]''. Tsukasa wakes up to find himself in a dungeon in ''The World'', but he suffers from short-term memory loss as he wonders where he is and how he got there. The situation gets worse when he discovers he is unable to log out and is trapped in the game. From then on, along with other players Tsukasa embarks on a quest to figure out the truth behind his abnormal situation.  The series is influenced by psychological and sociological subjects such as [[anxiety]], [[escapism]], and [[interpersonal relationship]]s.&lt;ref name="proto-hack1"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Matsuda |first=Miyako |title=Presentation |journal=[[Protoculture Addicts]] |issue=75 |page=4 |date=April 2003 |isbn=978-2-9805759-8-3 |url=http://www.protoculture.ca/PA/PA75edito.htm |accessdate=August 14, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927225646/http://www.protoculture.ca/PA/PA75edito.htm |archivedate=September 27, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="proto-hack2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.protoculture.ca/eZine/hack.htm |title=''.hack//Sign'' Essay |work=[[Protoculture Inc.|Protoculture]] |last=Matsuda |first=Miyako |accessdate=August 14, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927225710/http://www.protoculture.ca/eZine/hack.htm |archivedate=September 27, 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The series premiered in Japan on [[TV Tokyo]] between April 4, 2002 and September 25, 2002. It was later broadcast across East Asia, Southeast Asia, South Asia, and Latin America by the anime television network, [[Animax]]; and across the United States, Nigeria, Canada, and United Kingdom by [[List of international Cartoon Network channels|Cartoon Network]], [[YTV (TV channel)|YTV]], and [[AnimeCentral]] (English and Japanese) respectively. It is distributed across North America by [[Bandai|Bandai Entertainment]].
*''[[.hack//Legend of the Twilight]]'' is a twelve episode anime adaption of the [[manga]] series written by Tatsuya Hamazaki and drawn by [[Rei Izumi]].  The series was directed by [[Koichi Mashimo]] and [[Koji Sawai]], and produced by [[Bee Train]]. Set in a fictional [[MMORPG]], ''[[The World (.hack)|The World]]'', the series focuses on twins Rena and Shugo, who receive chibi [[Avatar (virtual reality)|avatar]]s in the design of the legendary .hackers known as [[Kite (.hack)|Kite]] and [[BlackRose (.hack)|BlackRose]]. After Shugo is given the Twilight Bracelet by a mysterious girl, the two embark on a quest to find Aura and unravel the mystery of the Twilight Bracelet. The anime series features many of the same characters as the manga version, but with an alternative storyline. It was localized as ''.hack//Dusk'', among other names, in fan translations prior to the official English release.
*''[[.hack//Liminality]]'' is a set of four [[DVD]] [[OVA]]s included with the [[.hack (video game series)|''.hack'' video game series]] for the [[PlayStation 2]]. ''Liminality'' is focused on the real world as opposed to the games' [[MMORPG]] ''[[The World (.hack)|The World]]''. Separated into four volumes; each volume was released with its corresponding game. The initial episode is 45 minutes long and each subsequent episode is 30 minutes long. The video series was directed by [[Koichi Mashimo]], written by [[Kazunori Itō]] with music by [[Yuki Kajiura]]. Primary animation production was handled by Mashimo's studio [[Bee Train]] which collaborated for the four games as well as handled major production on [[.hack//Sign]]. ''Liminality'' follows the story of Mai Minase, Yuki Aihara, Kyoko Tohno, and ex-CyberConnect employee Junichiro Tokuoka as they attempt to find out why players are falling into comas when playing in ''The World''.
*''[[List of .hack//Sign episodes|.hack//Gift]]'', a self-deprecating, tongue-in-cheek, OVA that was created as a "gift" for those who had bought and completed all four ''.hack'' video games. It was released under Project .hack. In Japan, it was available when the Data Flag on the memory card file in ''[[.hack//Quarantine]]'' was present, whereas the American version included ''Gift'' on the fourth ''Liminality'' DVD. It is predominantly a comedy that makes fun of everything that developed throughout the series, even the franchise's own shortcomings. Character designs are deliberately simplistic.

It tells the story of [[Albireo (.hack)|Albireo]] and a prototype of the ultimate [[Artificial intelligence|AI]], Lycoris, and of how [[Orca (.hack)|Orca]] and [[Balmung (.hack)|Balmung]] defeated "The One Sin" and became the Descendants of Fianna.

The first scholarly edition of Northup's memoir, co-edited in 1968 by [[Sue Eakin]] and [[Joseph Logsdon]], carefully retraced and validated the account and concluded it to be accurate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Toplin | first1 = Robert Brent | year = 1969 | title = ''Twelve Years a Slave'' (review) | journal = Civil War History | volume = 15 | issue = 1 | pages = 66 | publisher =  | jstor =  | doi = 10.1353/cwh.1969.0065 | url =  | format =  | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other characters in the film were also real people, including Edwin and Mary Epps, and [[Patsey]].

==Plot==
In 1841, [[Solomon Northup]] is a free African-American man working as a violinist, living with his wife and two children in [[Saratoga Springs, New York]]. Two white men, Brown and Hamilton, offer him short-term employment as a musician if he will travel with them to Washington, D.C. However, once they arrive they drug Northup and deliver him to a [[Slavery in the United States|slave pen]] run by a man named Burch. Northup proclaims that he is a free man, only to be savagely beaten with a wooden paddle and then a leather belt. Northup is later shipped to [[New Orleans]] along with other captive African Americans. He is told by the others that if he wants to survive in the South, he must adapt to being a slave and not tell anyone he is a free man. A slave trader named Theophilus Freeman gives Northup the identity of "Platt", a runaway slave from Georgia, and sells him to plantation owner [[William Prince Ford|William Ford]]. Ford takes a liking to Northup and gives him a violin. However, tension grows between Northup and plantation overseer John Tibeats which ends with Northup savagely beating and whipping Tibeats. Tibeats and his group try to hang Northup. Although they are not successful, Northup is left on the noose for hours before he is finally cut down. To save Northup's life, Ford sells him to another slave owner named Edwin Epps. In the process, Northup attempts to explain that he is actually a free man, but Ford tells him he is too afraid and that he cannot help him now.

Edwin Epps, unlike Ford, is ruthless and unforgiving. Northup meets Patsey, a favored slave who can pick over 500 pounds of cotton a day, twice the usual quota, whom Epps regularly [[rape]]s and abuses. Sometime later, [[cotton worm]]s destroy Epps's cotton. Unable to work his fields, Epps leases his slaves to a neighboring plantation for the season. While there, Northup gains the favor of the plantation's owner, Judge Turner, who allows him to play the fiddle at a neighbor's wedding anniversary celebration and to keep his earnings. When Northup returns to Epps, he uses the money to pay a white field hand and former overseer, Armsby, to mail a letter to his friends in New York. Armsby agrees and accepts Northup's saved money, but immediately betrays him to Epps. In the middle of the night, a drunken Epps wakes Northup and questions him menacingly about the letter. Northup is narrowly able to convince Epps that Armsby is lying and Epps relents. Northup in a rage destroys his violin.

Northup begins working on the construction of a [[gazebo]] with a Canadian laborer named Samuel Bass. Bass is unsettled by the brutal way that Epps treats his slaves and expresses his opposition to American slavery, earning Epps's enmity. Northup overhears the conversation and decides to reveal his kidnapping to Bass. Once again, Northup asks for help in getting a letter to Saratoga Springs. Although Bass is hesitant at first because of the risks, he agrees to send it. One day, the local sheriff arrives in a carriage with another man. The sheriff asks Northup a series of questions to confirm that his answers match the facts of his life in New York. Northup recognizes the sheriff's companion as Mr. Parker, a shopkeeper he knew in Saratoga. Parker has come to free him, and the two embrace, though an enraged Epps furiously protests the circumstances and tries to prevent Northup from leaving. Northup gives an emotional farewell to Patsey and rides off to his freedom.

After being enslaved for 12 years, Northup is restored to freedom and returned to his family, leaving behind the other slaves. As he walks into his home, he sees his wife with their son and daughter (fully grown) and her husband, who present him with his grandson and namesake, Solomon Northup Staunton. Northup apologizes for his long absence while his family comforts him. The film's epilogue displays a series of graphics recounting Northup's unsuccessful suits against Brown, Hamilton, and Burch, along with the 1853 publication of Northup's [[slave narrative]] memoir, ''[[Twelve Years a Slave]]''. The memoir describes his role in the abolitionist movement and the mystery surrounding details of his death and burial. Patsey and Northup never met again.

[[File:John Ridley 12 Years A Slave.JPG|thumb|190px|[[John Ridley]] at the 2013 [[San Diego Film Festival]]]]
After meeting screenwriter [[John Ridley]] at a [[Creative Artists Agency]] screening of ''[[Hunger (2008 film)|Hunger]]'' in 2008, director [[Steve McQueen (director)|Steve McQueen]] got in touch with Ridley about his interest in making a film about "the slave era in America" with "a character that was not obvious in terms of their trade in slavery."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Thompson|first=Anne|title=John Ridley Talks Writing '12 Years a Slave' and Directing Hendrix Biopic 'All Is by My Side'|url=http://blogs.indiewire.com/thompsononhollywood/john-ridley-talks-writing-12-years-a-slave-and-directing-hendrix-biopic-all-is-by-my-side|work=[[IndieWire]]|publisher=[[Snagfilms]]|accessdate=October 25, 2013|date=October 16, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131013203658/http://blogs.indiewire.com/thompsononhollywood/john-ridley-talks-writing-12-years-a-slave-and-directing-hendrix-biopic-all-is-by-my-side|archive-date=October 13, 2013|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Developing the idea back and forth, the two did not strike a chord until McQueen's partner, Bianca Stigter, found [[Solomon Northup]]'s 1853 memoir ''[[Twelve Years a Slave]]''. McQueen later told an interviewer:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I read this book, and I was totally stunned. At the same time, I was pretty upset with myself that I didn't know this book. I live in [[Amsterdam]] where [[Anne Frank]] is a national hero, and for me, this book read like [[The Diary of a Young Girl|Anne Frank's diary]] but written 97 years before&amp;nbsp;– a firsthand account of slavery. I basically made it my passion to make this book into a film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='12 Years A Slave' Was A Film That 'No One Was Making'|url=https://www.npr.org/2013/10/24/240288057/12-years-a-slave-was-a-film-that-no-one-was-making|publisher=[[NPR]]|accessdate=October 25, 2013|date=October 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After a lengthy development process, during which Brad Pitt's production company [[Plan B Entertainment]] backed the project, which eventually helped get some financing from various film studios, the film was officially announced in August 2011 with McQueen to direct and [[Chiwetel Ejiofor]] to star as Solomon Northup, a [[free African-American]] who was kidnapped and sold into slavery in the [[Deep South]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Sneider | first=Jeff | title=McQueen tallying '12 Years' at Plan B | journal=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date=August 17, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; McQueen compared Ejiofor's conduct "of class and dignity" to that of [[Sidney Poitier]] and [[Harry Belafonte]].&lt;ref name="truitt"&gt;{{cite news | last=Truitt | first=Brian | url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2013/06/18/12-years-a-slave-movie-first-look/2429803/ | title=First look: 'Twelve Years a Slave' | work=[[USA Today]] | date=June 18, 2013 | accessdate=June 19, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2011, [[Michael Fassbender]] (who starred in McQueen's previous films ''Hunger'' and ''[[Shame (2011 film)|Shame]]'') joined the cast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Kroll | first=Justin | title=Duo team on 'Slave' | journal=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date=October 12, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In early 2012, the rest of the roles were cast, and filming was scheduled to begin at the end of June 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Sneider | first=Jeff | title=Thesps join McQueen's 'Slave' cast | journal=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date=May 24, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kroll|first=Justin|title=Giamatti, Paulson join 'Slave'|url=https://variety.com/2012/film/news/giamatti-paulson-join-slave-1118055057/|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|accessdate=October 30, 2013|date=June 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To capture the language and dialects of the era and regions in which the film takes place, dialect coach Michael Buster assisted the cast in altering their speech. The language has a literary quality related to the style of writing of the day and the strong influence of the [[King James Bible]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Scott|first=Mike|title='12 Years a Slave': Five cool things to know about the New Orleans-shot historical epic|url=http://www.nola.com/movies/index.ssf/2013/10/12_years_a_slave_five_cool_thi.html|work=[[The Times-Picayune]]|accessdate=October 29, 2013|date=October 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Buster explained:
&lt;blockquote&gt;We don't know what slaves sounded like in the 1840s, so I just used rural samples from Mississippi and Louisiana [for actors Ejiofor and Fassbender]. Then for [[Benedict Cumberbatch|Benedict [Cumberbatch]]], I found some real upper-class New Orleanians from the '30s. And then I also worked with [[Lupita Nyong'o]], who is Kenyan but she did her training at Yale. So she really shifted her speech so she could do American speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lytal|first=Cristy|title='12 Years a Slave' dialect coach Michael Buster speaks up|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2013/sep/28/entertainment/la-et-ct-working-hollywood-dialect-coach-michael-buster-20130929|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=October 29, 2013|date=September 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After both won Oscars at the [[86th Academy Awards]], it was reported that McQueen and Ridley had been in an ongoing feud over screenplay credit. McQueen reportedly had asked Ridley for shared credit, which he declined. McQueen appealed to Fox Searchlight, which sided with Ridley.

==Historical accuracy==
African-American history and culture scholar [[Henry Louis Gates Jr.]] was a consultant on the film, and researcher David Fiske, co-author of ''Solomon Northup: The Complete Story of the Author of Twelve Years a Slave,'' provided some material used to market the film.&lt;ref name="NYT9" /&gt; Nevertheless, news and magazine articles around the time of the film's release described a scholar alleging some license that Northup could have taken with his book, and liberties that McQueen definitely took with Northup's original, for dramatic, modernizing, or other reasons.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

Scott Feinberg wrote in ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' about a September 22 article in ''The New York Times'' that "dredged up and highlighted a 1985 essay by another scholar, James Olney, that questioned the 'literal truth' of specific incidents in Northup's account and suggested that David Wilson, the white [[amanuensis]] to whom Northup had dictated his story, had taken the liberty of sprucing it up to make it even more effective at rallying public opinion against slavery."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Feinberg|first=Scott|title=Oscar Whisper Campaigns: The Slurs Against '12 Years,' 'Captain Phillips,' 'Gravity' and 'The Butler' |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/race/12-years-a-slave-gravity-650261 |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|accessdate=November 19, 2013|date=October 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Olney, when [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionists]] invited an ex-slave to share his experience in slavery at an antislavery convention, and when they subsequently funded the appearance of that story in print, "they had certain clear expectations, well understood by themselves and well understood by the ex-slave, too."&lt;ref name="NYT9"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/23/business/media/an-escape-from-slavery-now-a-movie-has-long-intrigued-historians.html|title=An Escape From Slavery, Now a Movie, Has Long Intrigued Historians |last=Cieply |first=Michael |work=[[The New York Times]]|date=September 22, 2013|accessdate=November 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Noah Berlatsky wrote in ''[[The Atlantic]]'' about a scene in McQueen's adaptation. Shortly after Northup's kidnapping, he is sent on a slave ship. One of the sailors attempts to rape a female slave, but is stopped by a male slave. "The sailor unhesitatingly stabs and kills [the male slave]," he wrote, stating that "this seems unlikely on its face—slaves are valuable, and the sailor is not the owner. And, sure enough, the scene is not in the book."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2013/10/how-em-12-years-a-slave-em-gets-history-right-by-getting-it-wrong/280911/|title=How 12 Years a Slave Gets History Right: By Getting It Wrong|last=Berlatsky|first=Noah|work=[[The Atlantic]]|date=October 28, 2013|accessdate=November 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Forrest Wickman of ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' wrote of Northup's book giving a more favorable account of the author's onetime master, William Ford, than the McQueen film. In Northup's own words, "There never was a more kind, noble, candid, Christian man than William Ford," adding that Ford's circumstances "blinded [Ford] to the inherent wrong at the bottom of the system of Slavery." The movie, however, according to Wickham, "frequently undermines Ford."&lt;ref name="Slate"&gt;{{cite web|last=Wickman|first=Forrest|title=How Accurate Is 12 Years a Slave?|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2013/10/17/_12_years_a_slave_true_story_fact_and_fiction_in_mostly_accurate_movie_about.html|work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|accessdate=November 17, 2013|date=October 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; McQueen undercuts Christianity itself as well, in an effort to update the ethical lessons from Northup's story for the 21st century, by holding the institutions of Christianity up to the light for their ability to justify slavery at the time.&lt;ref name="WP"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/on-faith/wp/2013/11/15/in-12-years-a-slave-a-broken-christianity/|title=In 12 Years a Slave, a broken Christianity|last=Dixon|first=Valerie Elverton|work=The Washington Post|date=November 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Northup was a Christian of his time, writing of his former master being "blinded" by "circumstances"&lt;ref name="Slate" /&gt; that in retrospect meant a racist acceptance of slavery despite being a Christian, a position untenable to Christians now&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2013/september-web-only/12-years-slave.html|title=Movies &amp; TV: 12 Years a Slave|publisher=[[Christianity Today]]|date=October 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to [[Christian views on slavery#Christian abolitionism|Christian abolitionists]] of the 19th century but not contradictory to Northup himself. Valerie Elverton Dixon in ''[[The Washington Post]]'' characterized the Christianity depicted in the movie as "broken".&lt;ref name="WP" /&gt;

Emily West, an associate professor of history at the [[University of Reading]] who specializes in the history of slavery in the U.S., said she had "never seen a film represent slavery so accurately".&lt;ref name="historian" /&gt; Reviewing the film for ''History Extra'', the website of ''BBC History Magazine'', she said: "The film starkly and powerfully unveiled the sights and sounds of enslavement&amp;nbsp;– from slaves picking cotton as they sang in the fields, to the crack of the lash down people's backs.  We also heard a lot about the ideology behind enslavement. Masters such as William Ford and Edwin Epps, although very different characters, both used an interpretation of Christianity to justify their ownership of slaves. They believed the Bible sanctioned slavery, and that it was their 'Christian duty' to preach the scriptures to their slaves."&lt;ref name="historian"&gt;{{cite web|title=Historian at the Movies: 12 Years a Slave reviewed|url=http://www.historyextra.com/feature/historian-movies-12-years-slave-reviewed|publisher=History Extra|accessdate=January 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marketing===
Due to both the film's explicit nature and award contender status, ''12 Years a Slave'''s financial success was being watched closely. Many analysts compared the film's content to other drama films of a similar vein such as ''[[Schindler's List]]'' (1993) and ''[[The Passion of the Christ]]'' (2004), which became box office successes despite their respective subject matters.&lt;ref name="NYDN" /&gt;&lt;ref name="LAT-Market" /&gt; "It may be a tough subject matter, but when handled well&amp;nbsp;... films that are tough to sit through can still be commercially successful," said Phil Contrino of ''[[Boxoffice (magazine)|Boxoffice Magazine]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ryan|first=Joal|title=12 Years a Slave Could Win Best Picture, but About the Box Office&amp;nbsp;... |url=http://www.eonline.com/news/471562/12-years-a-slave-could-win-best-picture-but-about-the-box-office-|publisher=[[E!]]|accessdate=October 27, 2013|date=October 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite its content, the film's critical success has assisted its domestic distribution by [[Fox Searchlight]] that began with a limited released aimed primarily towards [[Art film|art house]] and African-American patrons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Horn|first=John|title=In first wider weekend, '12 Years a Slave' reaches key audiences|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-12-years-a-slave-box-office-20131029,0,4804167.story#axzz2jAR8mzBa|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=October 29, 2013|date=October 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film's release was gradually widened in subsequent weeks, similarly to how the studio had successfully done in years prior with films such as ''[[Black Swan (film)|Black Swan]]'' and ''[[The Descendants]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cunningham|first=Todd|title=Can '12 Years a Slave' Translate Oscar Buzz into Box Office?|url=http://www.thewrap.com/12-years-slave-oscar-buzz-box-office-steve-mcqueen|website=[[TheWrap]]|publisher=The Wrap News Inc.|accessdate=October 27, 2013|date=October 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; International release dates for ''12 Years a Slave'' were largely delayed to early 2014 in order to take advantage of the attention created by [[Film awards seasons|awards seasons]].&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{cite web|last=Cieply|first=Michael|title=The International Fate of '12 Years': Steve McQueen's Film Is a Box-Office Test Case|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/29/business/media/steve-mcqueens-film-is-a-box-office-test-case.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=October 29, 2013|date=October 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Film review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reports that 96% of critics gave the film a positive rating, based on 338 reviews with an [[Weighted mean|average score]] of 8.9/10, with the site's consensus stating, "It's far from comfortable viewing, but ''12 Years a Slave''{{'}}s unflinchingly brutal look at American slavery is also brilliant -- and quite possibly essential -- cinema."&lt;ref name="rt"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/12_years_a_slave/|title=''12 Years a Slave'' (2013)|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|publisher=[[Fandango Media]]|accessdate=February 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Metacritic]], another [[review aggregator]], assigned the film a weighted average score of 96 out of 100 based on 56 reviews from mainstream critics, considered to be "universal acclaim".

Richard Corliss of ''[[Time (magazine)|TIME]]'' wrote: "McQueen's film is closer in its storytelling particulars to such 1970s exploitation-exposés of slavery as ''[[Mandingo (film)|Mandingo]]'' and ''[[Goodbye Uncle Tom|Goodbye, Uncle Tom]]''. Except that McQueen is not a schlockmeister sensationalist but a remorseless artist". Corliss draws parallels with [[Nazi Germany]], saying, "McQueen shows that racism, aside from its barbarous inhumanity, is insanely inefficient. It can be argued that Nazi Germany lost the war both because it diverted so much manpower to the killing of Jews and because it did not exploit the brilliance of Jewish scientists in building smarter weapons. So the slave owners dilute the energy of their slaves by whipping them for sadistic sport and, as Epps does, waking them at night to dance for his wife's cruel pleasure."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://entertainment.time.com/2013/09/09/12-years-a-slave-and-mandela-two-tales-of-racism-survived/|title='12 Years a Slave' and 'Mandela': Two Tales of Racism Survived|last=Corliss|first=Richard|work=[[Time (magazine)|TIME]]|date=September 9, 2013|accessdate=October 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gregory Ellwood of [[HitFix]] gave the film an "A-" rating, stating, "''12 Years'' is a powerful drama driven by McQueen's bold direction and the finest performance of Chiwetel Ejiofor's career." He continued by praising the performances of Fassbender and Nyong'o, citing Nyong'o as "the film's breakthrough performance [that] may find Nyong'o making her way to the [[Dolby Theatre|Dolby Theater]] next [[86th Academy Awards|March]]". He also admired the film's "gorgeous" cinematography and the musical score, as "one of [[Hans Zimmer]]'s more moving scores in some time".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hitfix.com/in-contention/review-powerful-12-years-a-slave-wont-turn-away-from-the-brutality-of-slavery#~oj4x7coGBGboDz|title=Review: Powerful 12 Years a Slave won't turn away from the brutality of slavery|last=Ellwood|first=Gregory|work=[[HitFix]]|date=August 31, 2013|accessdate=October 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paul MacInnes of ''[[The Guardian]]'' scored the film five out of five stars, writing, "Stark, visceral and unrelenting, ''12 Years a Slave'' is not just a great film but a necessary one."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=MacInnes|first=Paul|title=12 Years a Slave: Toronto film festival - first look review|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/sep/07/twelve-years-a-slave-review-toronto|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=October 26, 2013|date=September 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Owen Gleiberman]] of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' praised it as "a new movie landmark of cruelty and transcendence" and as "a movie about a life that gets taken away, and that's why it lets us touch what life is". He also commented very positively about Ejiofor's performance, while further stating, "''12 Years a Slave'' lets us stare at the primal sin of America with open eyes, and at moments it is hard to watch, yet it's a movie of such humanity and grace that at every moment, you feel you're seeing something essential. It is Chiwetel Ejiofor's extraordinary performance that holds the movie together, and that allows us to watch it without blinking. He plays Solomon with a powerful inner strength, yet he never soft-pedals the silent nightmare that is Solomon's daily existence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://insidemovies.ew.com/2013/09/07/toronto-12-years-a-slave-is-a-landmark/|title=Toronto 2013: '12 Years a Slave' is a landmark of cruelty and transcendence|last=Gleiberman|first=Owen|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|publisher=[[CNN]]|date=September 7, 2013|accessdate=October 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peter Travers]] of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', gave the film a four-star rating and said: "you won't be able to tuck this powder keg in the corner of your mind and forget it. What we have here is a blistering, brilliant, straight-up classic." He later named the film the best movie of 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Travers|first=Peter|title='12 Years a Slave' Review|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/reviews/12-years-a-slave-20131017|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|publisher=Wenner Media LLC|accessdate=October 27, 2013|date=October 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Manohla Dargis]] wrote, in her review for ''[[The New York Times]]'', "the genius of ''12 Years a Slave'' is its insistence on banal evil, and on terror, that seeped into souls, bound bodies and reaped an enduring, terrible price".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dargis|first=Manohla|title=The Blood and Tears, Not the Magnolias: '12 Years a Slave' Holds Nothing Back in Show of Suffering|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/18/movies/12-years-a-slave-holds-nothing-back-in-show-of-suffering.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=October 27, 2013|date=October 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'s'' Tim Robey granted the film a maximum score of five stars, stating that "it's the nobility of this remarkable film that pierces the soul", while praising Ejiofor and Nyong'o's performances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Robey|first=Tim|title=12 Years A Slave, first review|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/filmreviews/10293267/12-Years-A-Slave-first-review.html|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|accessdate=October 27, 2013|date=October 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tina Hassannia of ''[[Slant Magazine]]'' said that "using his signature visual composition and deafening sound design, Steve McQueen portrays the harrowing realism of Northup's experience and the complicated relationships between master and slave, master and master, slave and slave, and so on".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hassannia|first=Tina|title=Toronto International Film Festival 2013: 12 Years a Slave Review|url=http://www.slantmagazine.com/house/2013/09/toronto-international-film-festival-2013-12-years-a-slave|work=[[Slant Magazine]]|accessdate=October 27, 2013|date=September 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Simon]], the creator of the TV series ''[[The Wire]]'', highly praised the movie, commenting that "it marks the first time in history that our entertainment industry, albeit with international creative input, has managed to stare directly at slavery and maintain that gaze".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://davidsimon.com/slavery-a-film-narrative-and-the-myth-of-original-intent/ |title=Slavery, a film narrative and the empty myth of original intent |publisher=DavidSimon.com |date=October 29, 2013 |accessdate=January 21, 2015 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6XPBx4z94?url=http://davidsimon.com/slavery-a-film-narrative-and-the-myth-of-original-intent/ |archivedate=March 30, 2015 |deadurl=no |df=mdy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film, however, was not without its criticisms. [[Stephanie Zacharek]] of ''[[The Village Voice]]'' was more critical of the film. While praising Ejiofor's work, she stated: "It's a picture that stays more than a few safe steps away from anything so dangerous as raw feeling. Even when it depicts inhuman cruelty, as it often does, it never compromises its aesthetic purity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Zacharek|first=Stephanie|title=12 Years a Slave Prizes Radiance Over Life|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/2013-10-16/film/12-years-a-slave/|work=[[The Village Voice]]|publisher=[[Voice Media Group]]|accessdate=October 28, 2013|date=October 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Malamud Smith of ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' criticized the story, saying, "''12 Years a Slave'' is constructed as a story of a man trying to return to his family, offering every viewer a way into empathizing with its protagonist. Maybe we need a story framed on that individual scale in order to understand it. But it has a distorting effect all the same. We're more invested in one hero than in millions of victims; if we're forced to imagine ourselves enslaved, we want to imagine ourselves as Northup, a special person who miraculously escaped the system that attempted to crush him." Describing this as "the hero problem", Malamud Smith concluded his review explaining, "We can handle ''12 Years a Slave''. But don't expect ''60 Years a Slave'' any time soon. And ''200 Years, Millions of Slaves''? Forget about it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Malamud Smith|first=Peter|title=We Can Be Heroes: 12 Years a Slave, Schindler's List, and the hero problem in American movies.|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/culturebox/2013/10/_12_years_a_slave_and_schindler_s_list_how_american_movies_valorize_those.single.html|work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|accessdate=October 28, 2013|date=October 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ignatiy Vishnevetsky of ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' opined that McQueen is "essentially tone-deaf when it comes to performance, and skirts by on casting". The film "lacks a necessary emotional continuity. I don't think it's something the movie is denying in the way it intentionally denies so many other conventions; it's still structured around an ending that's supposed to function as a release, but because it can’t organize that sense of catharsis it so badly needs, it just feels as though McQueen is scurrying for an exit. Also: The cast is wildly uneven."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = What didn't deserve to make our Best Films Of The Decade So Far list?|url = http://www.avclub.com/article/what-didnt-deserve-make-our-best-films-decade-so-f-217526|website = www.avclub.com|accessdate = 2015-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; At ''[[The Guardian]]'', black Canadian author [[Orville Lloyd Douglas]] said he would not be seeing ''12 Years a Slave'', explaining: "I'm convinced these black race films are created for a white, liberal film audience to engender [[white guilt]] and make them feel bad about themselves. Regardless of your race, these films are unlikely to teach you anything you don't already know."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/sep/12/why-im-not-watching-the-butler-12-years-a-slave|title=Why I won't be watching The Butler and 12 Years a Slave|first=Orville |last=Lloyd Douglas|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=September 12, 2013|accessdate=December 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Timothy Sneed said in ''[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]]'' the year after the film was released, "Doubts still lingered about its ability to truly bring about a newfound racial consciousness among a national, mainstream audience&amp;nbsp;... The film also was a period piece that featured a happy ending ushered in by a '[[white savior narrative in film|white savior]]' in the form of Brad Pitt's character."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Sneed | first=Timothy | url=https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2014/07/18/a-year-after-trayvon-martin-who-is-leading-the-race-conversation | title=A Year After Trayvon Martin, Who Is Leading the Race Conversation? | date=July 18, 2014 | work=[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==

=== Acting and filmmaking ===
Samberg majored in [[experimental film]]. He became a [[YouTube]] and [[Internet]] star and made his own comedy videos with his two friends [[Akiva Schaffer]] and [[Jorma Taccone]]. When YouTube was created in 2005, the streaming of their videos became much more widespread over the Internet. Samberg became a featured player on ''SNL'' in part because of the work he had done on their sketch comedy website TheLonelyIsland.com, which helped them land an agent and eventually get hired at ''SNL''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Yuval|last=Rosenberg|url=http://www.fastcompany.com/55984/target-dream-job|title=Target: Dream Job|work=''[[Fast Company (magazine)|Fast Company]]''|publisher=Fast Co.

The trio began writing for ''Saturday Night Live'' in 2005 and released their debut album, ''[[Incredibad]]'', in 2009. Samberg appeared in numerous theatrical films, commercials, music videos and hosted special events, including the [[2009 MTV Movie Awards]].

An '''animateur''' is a [[music]]al professional whose role is to engage audiences with a new or unfamiliar form of music,&lt;ref name="mediamatch" /&gt; "bringing it to life" beyond what might be expected in a traditional performance.

The role of animateur developed from the French concept of "animation socio-culturelle" and first became established in the 1980s as musical outreach activities were being formalised in the UK.&lt;ref name="Higgins2012" /&gt; Because the role has roots in the United Kingdom,&lt;ref name="polyphonic" /&gt; they are most common in the English-speaking world.

While an animateur is likely to have some skill in performance (with voice or instrument), conducting, teaching and possibly composition or arrangement, their principal role is to assist the communication of the performers and the audience. If working with a [[symphony orchestra]], for instance, they might accomplish this through running participatory workshops to introduce audience members to aspects of the music to be performed, or by facilitating dialogue between performers and audience members.

There are animateurs in a wide number of musical styles. While they are probably most common in [[classical music]], they also work in [[jazz]], [[gamelan]] and some forms of African traditional music. Often they are employed by an orchestra, concert hall or music education service, though some also work freelance accepting commissions from groups or organisations for a specific occasion. Animateurs also work with children (where the discipline can approach a form of musical [[youth work]]) as well as adults. Possibly the best known animateur in the United Kingdom is [[Gareth Malone]], who for some years ran the youth and community choirs at the [[London Symphony Orchestra]]'s music education center, [[LSO St Luke's]] prior to applying the same skills in a series of television programmes.

==Plot==
===Part One===
[[Katara (Avatar: The Last Airbender)|Katara]] and [[Sokka]] return to their home village in the Southern Water Tribe, discovering that it has been transformed into a bustling and thriving city reminiscent of the Northern Water Tribe, and that their father Hakoda has been elected leader of the entire south. Though Sokka is enthusiastic at the changes, Katara fears that their tribe is losing its cultural identity. While dining out with Malina and her brother Maliq, the northerners in charge of the redevelopment process, thieves steal a briefcase containing important documents from Maliq, with Malina getting injured in the struggle.

Katara and Sokka follow the thieves to a secret hideout occupied by a group of southern nationalists, who resent the northern tribe's imposition of their values onto the southern tribe, as well as Hakoda's complicity in the matter. Their leader, Gilak, expresses his belief that Malina and Maliq have a hidden agenda, before Katara and Sokka escape the group and return to the city. During their escape, the pair run into Thod, Gilak's second in command, who tells them of a story of a snow rat with the ability to talk and walk on two feet who endeared himself to a human tribe, only to be driven away by them when he asked to be treated as an equal. The siblings and Maliq enter the tent where Malina is recovering with Hakoda by her side, only to discover the pair of them kissing.

===Part Two===
Hakoda investigates the nationalists' hideout, only to discover it abandoned with a note informing him that he will soon see the truth. Elsewhere, Katara and Sokka learn from Malina and Maliq that, as part of the redevelopment process, they will be extracting from a massive [[oil reservoir]] recently discovered in the Southern Water Tribe, in order to enable a new age of machinery in which machines become part of everyday life. Katara continues to have issues with Malina and her relationship with Hakoda, owing to her plans and unintentionally offensive remarks towards the South. Further conversation reveals that Malina and Maliq are business partners of Toph's father, with Toph herself later arriving as a representative of her father.

At a festival thrown by Malina and Maliq, Katara and Sokka meet up with Aang, who has returned from helping to solve [[Avatar: The Last Airbender – Smoke and Shadow|the crisis in the Fire Nation]]. As Malina makes a speech about her plans, the festival is attacked by Gilak's nationalists, with Gilak accusing her and Maliq of attempting to seize the oil for the Northern Water Tribe, in order to make the Southern Tribe a [[puppet state]] of the North. As proof, he cites the documents that were stolen from Maliq. Malina admits that she had originally planned to give the oil to the North, out of fear the South would be unable to handle it properly, but changed her mind upon meeting Hakoda and seeing that the South was capable of doing so. Maliq however insists that they carry on with the original plan, decrying the South as culturally backwards and incapable of governing itself, let alone managing the oil.

Malina agrees to step down from the redevelopment project and leave the South Pole with all her people in an attempt to defuse the situation, but Gilak and the nationalists attack. In the ensuing battle, Thod reminds Katara of the story he told her, comparing the humans' treatment of the snow rat to the North's low opinion of the South, to convince her to join Gilak, but she refuses. Later on, Hakoda attempts to persuade Gilak to give up his crusade, but Gilak stabs Hakoda in the chest before he and his men are captured. The night following the battle, Sokka and Katara briefly argue over the South's future, Sokka pointing out that Malina and Maliq's plan of using the oil has merits, Katara unwilling to allow the South to lose its cultural identity. Elsewhere, as Gilak sits in his prison cell, one of Hakoda's officers smuggles him the key to his cell door, having been convinced of his opinions.

===Part Three===
To continue the redevelopment of the South, Toph brings her metalbending students over to help with construction, while Hakoda invites Fire Lord Zuko and Earth King Kuei over to discuss a collaborative reconstruction effort between the three nations. The meeting is interrupted when Gilak and his nationalists escape their imprisonment and force their way into the meeting room, kidnapping Kuei during the subsequent fight. Gilak, who by now considers Hakoda a traitor to the South due to his willingness to collaborate with foreigners, demands that Hakoda turn himself over in exchange for Kuei's return.

The two groups meet at the Bridge of No Return, a rope bridge once used to exile Southern Water Tribe criminals. As part of the exchange agreement, Aang, Katara, Toph and Zuko agree to be chi-blocked by the nationalists, before Hakoda and Kuei are sent across the bridge. Once the two men are in the middle of the bridge, Gilak attempts to collapse it and kill them both, but he is foiled by Malina and Toph's metalbending students, who had sneaked over to the other side of the bridge prior to the exchange. Aang, Katara and Toph then subdue the nationalists on their side of the bridge, having used chainmail armor designed by Sokka and the metalbending students to avoid being chi-blocked.

His forces beaten, Gilak destroys the bridge in order to kill Hakoda, while Malina tries to stop him. Aang barely manages to carry the three of them whilst flying his glider, but Gilak's attempts to kill Hakoda cause him to lose his grip and fall to his death. Fearing that Aang will not be able to carry both her and Hakoda, Malina attempts to sacrifice herself for the other two by letting go of Hakoda's hand, professing her love for him as she does so, but she is saved by Katara.

The next day, Katara and Sokka visits their mother Kya's grave, and Katara admits that her ideal Southern Water Tribe would be one where her beloved mother was still alive. She then states that she has felt her mother's spirit support her last night, and on her previous adventures, and with this belief that her mother has been with her all along, she is subsequently able to accept the changes happening in the South more easily. The characters then meet up in Gran-Gran's hut for a feast that includes cuisine from all of their cultures.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24832">The [[United Kingdom|British]] theatre company '''Complicite''' was founded in 1983 by [[Simon McBurney]], [[Annabel Arden]], and Marcello Magni. Its original name was '''Théâtre de Complicite'''. The company is based in London and uses extreme movement to represent their work. "The Company's inimitable style of visual and devised theatre [has] an emphasis on strong, corporeal, poetic and surrealist image supporting text" (Stephen Knapper, 2010, Contemporary European Theatre Directors). Its work has been influenced by [[Jacques Lecoq]]. The company produced their first work in 1983. In 1985 they won the [[Perrier Comedy Award]] at the [[Edinburgh Fringe Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Thorpe|first1=Vanessa|title=Sophie Hunter: The Opera Director Who Has to Dodge Paparazzie|url=http://sophiehunter.net/post/123849640525/sophie-hunter-the-opera-director-who-has-to-dodge|website=Sophie Hunter Central}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Edinburgh Comedy Awards|url=http://comedyawards.co.uk/comedyshow.asp}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their productions often involve dazzling use of technology, such as [[video design|projection]] and cameras, as well as lyrical and philosophical contemplation of serious themes.

The company's lineup changes frequently, though McBurney continues to be the artistic director. Complicite is currently more active as an international touring company than within the UK. The Company is currently led from their base in [[London]] by producer, [[Judith Dimant]]. 

Major productions include ''[[The Master and Margarita#Theatre|The Master and Margarita]]'' (2011/12), ''A Dog's Heart'' (2010) with [[De Nederlandse Opera]] and [[English National Opera]], ''Endgame'' (2009),  ''Shun-kin'' (2008), ''[[A Disappearing Number]]'' (2007), ''[[Measure for Measure]]'' (2004), ''[[The Elephant Vanishes]]'' (2003, 2004) (performed in Japanese, adapted from the work of the writer [[Haruki Murakami]]), ''[[The Noise of Time (play)|The Noise of Time]]'' (2000) (about the [[Russia]]n composer [[Dimitri Shostakovich]], title from the 1925 memoir and collected essays by the poet [[Osip Mandelstam]], published in English in 1993); ''[[Mnemonic (play)|Mnemonic]]'' (1999); and ''[[The Street of Crocodiles]]'' (1992) (inspired by the life and works of [[Bruno Schulz]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.complicite.org/productions/index.html Complicite Productions Index]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bruno Schulz {{google books|6yjLAgAAQBAJ|The Street Of Crocodiles}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Master and Margarita'', an adaptation of [[Mikhail Bulgakov]]’s novel, sold out its run at [[Barbican Centre|The Barbican]], London in March/April 2012 and tours Europe in 2012. In 2010 ''[[A Disappearing Number]]'' (2010, 2008, 2007) which played at the [[Novello Theatre]], [[Barbican Theatre]] and [[Theatre Royal, Plymouth]], is a play about the mathematicians [[Ramanujan]] and [[G. H. Hardy]], the study of pure mathematics, the concepts of [[infinity]] and [[string theory]]. It focuses on our "relentless compulsion to understand".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.complicite.org/productions/detail.html?id=43 A Disappearing Number] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070205115211/http://www.complicite.org/productions/detail.html?id=43 |date=February 5, 2007 }}, Complicite.org&lt;/ref&gt; The music was written by [[Nitin Sawhney]] and the dramaturge was [[Ben Power]]. The play won many awards, including the [[Laurence Olivier Award]] 2008 for Best New Play. It was produced at the [[Lincoln Center]] Festival in [[New York City]] in 2010 and toured to [[Mumbai]] and [[Hyderabad]]. In 2010 it was broadcast to over 300 cinema screens worldwide as part of NT Live. 

''Shun-kin'' (2008), performed in Japanese, was adapted from [[Junichiro Tanizaki]]. It was first performed in [[Tokyo]] (February 2008) and then toured to London. It was revived in Tokyo in March 2009 and in London, [[Paris]], Tokyo and [[Taipei]] in 2010. 

Their main principles of work are "seeing what is most alive, integrating text, music, image and action to create surprising, disruptive theatre".

==Funding==
Other than revenue from ticket sales, Complicite receives funding from two sources: [[Arts Council England]] and private donations. 

"Complicite creates inspirational physical-based theatre, which it tours both nationally and internationally to world-class venues and partners. The company also provides a programme of professional workshops and educational initiatives. Our funding supports core costs." Complicite received £370,021 in 2008/2009, £380,012 in 2009/2010 and £390,272 in 2010/2011 from the Council.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artscouncil.org.uk/rfo/complicite/ "Complicite"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111020174746/http://www.artscouncil.org.uk/rfo/complicite/ |date=2011-10-20 }}, Arts Council England&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="42136">The '''conservation and restoration of film''' is the physical care and treatment of film-based materials (plastic supports). These include photographic materials and motion picture.

== Film supports ==

=== Cellulose nitrate ===
[[Cellulose nitrate]] (circa 1889 - circa 1950) is the first of film supports. It can be found as roll film, motion picture film, and sheet film. It is difficult to determine the dates when all nitrate film was discontinued, however, Eastman Kodak last manufactured nitrate film in 1951.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.imagepermanenceinstitute.org/webfm_send/302|title=Photographic Negatives: Nature and Evolution of Process|last=Valverde|first=Maria Fernanda|date=2005|website=Image Permanence Institute|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cellulose nitrate is cellulose fibers modified with nitric acid to create a nitrocellulose solid.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Cellulose nitrate is extremely flammable and capable of burning even in the absence of oxygen and underwater. It has been the cause of many fires and losses of motion picture films, photographic materials, and archival records.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

=== Cellulose acetate ===
[[Cellulose acetate]] is also known as "safety" film and started to replace nitrate film in the 1920s.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; There are several types of acetate that were produced after 1925, which include diacetate (circa 1923-circa 1955), acetate propionate (1927-circa 1949), acetate butyrate (1936-present), and triacetate (circa 1950-present).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The earliest, diacetate, was found to be inferior to nitrate because it had high shrinkage rates.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Eastman Kodak then worked with mixed esters of cellulose to create acetate butyrate and acetate propionate, which were used for sheet film, X-rays, amateur roll film, and aerial maps, but they were still found to be inferior to nitrate by the motion picture industry.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Triacetate was then produced and is still in production for roll film today.

=== Polyester ===
[[Polyester]] (1955 - present) started to replace acetate as a film support for many types of sheet film; however, due to its rigidity, it cannot be used as roll film.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Polyester can also be identified as "safety" film. It is inherently more stable than both cellulose nitrate and cellulose acetate, because it is a synthetic polymer that is inert (chemically inactive). It shows exceptional chemical stability and physical performance.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; A '''[https://www.nps.gov/museum/coldstorage/pdf/2.3.1b.pdf polarization test]''' can be used to identify polyester from cellulose acetate or nitrate. When viewed between cross-polarized filters, polyester will exhibit red and green interference colors, similar to a rainbow moiré pattern. Nitrate and acetate films will not show these interference colors.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nedcc.org/free-resources/preservation-leaflets/5.-photographs/5.1-a-short-guide-to-film-base-photographic-materials-identification,-care,-and-duplication|title=5.1 A Short Guide to Film Base Photographic Materials: Identification, Care, and Duplication|website=Northeast Document Conservation Center|language=en|access-date=2017-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Agents of deterioration ==

=== Temperature and humidity ===
The deterioration of both cellulose nitrate and cellulose acetate negatives is highly dependent on temperature and relative humidity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nedcc.org/free-resources/preservation-leaflets/5.-photographs/5.1-a-short-guide-to-film-base-photographic-materials-identification,-care,-and-duplication|title=5.1 A Short Guide to Film Base Photographic Materials: Identification, Care, and Duplication|website=Northeast Document Conservation Center|language=en|access-date=2017-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Storing materials at room temperature or warmer, and with high humidity, will inevitably cause deterioration. Extreme fluctuations in temperature and relative humidity will rapidly increase the rate of deterioration.

=== Exposure to light ===
Permanent display of photographs is not recommended; most photographic materials are vulnerable in varying degrees to deterioration caused by light. Damage caused by light is cumulative and depends on the intensity, length of exposure, and the wavelength of the radiation. Visible light in blue part of the spectrum (400 to 500 nanometers), and ultraviolet (UV) radiation (300-to 400 nanometer region) are especially damaging. Sunlight and standard fluorescent light are both strong sources of UV. Color slides are particularly susceptible to fading when exposed to both visible and UV light.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/preservation/care/photolea.html|title=Information Leaflet on the Care, Handling, and Storage of Photographs - Collections Care - Resources {{!}}Preservation {{!}} Library of Congress|website=www.loc.gov|access-date=2017-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pollution ===
Air pollution attacks photographs in the form of oxidant gases, particulate matter, acidic and sulfiding gases, and environmental fumes. Oxidant gases are composed primarily of pollution created by burning fossil fuels such as coal and oil. This can cause photographic images to fade. Particulate matter, such as soot and ash particles from manufacturing processes, exists in abundance outdoors and can enter the library or archives through heating and cooling ducts, doors, and windows. [[Particulates]], which may be greasy, abrasive, and chemically or biologically active, settle on shelves and on collection materials and create dust that is spread to other materials when they are handled. The by-products of combustion combined with moisture in the atmosphere pose another risk to photographic materials. These acids attack all components of photographs and cause silver images to fade and paper and board supports to discolor and become brittle. Environmental fumes can be especially damaging to photographic images even in small quantities.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

=== Poor storage ===
Poor storage, such as lack of enclosures, can lead to deterioration through exposure to light and pollution. Additionally, materials that are not carefully and safely stored can rub against each other, causing scratching and abrasions. Storing film materials in basements, attics, or garages can cause rapid deterioration through extreme temperature and humidity fluctuations, but also through exposure to insects and rodents.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.filmpreservation.org/userfiles/image/PDFs/fpg_6.pdf|title=Improving Film Storage Conditions|last=|first=|date=2004|website=National Film Preservation Foundation|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Storing materials on the floor can also increase the risk of damage by water leaks, insects and rodents.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

=== Poor handling and use ===
Film can be mishandled causing physical damage. Working at dirty workstations or using bad rollers for motion picture film can cause dirt, scratches, and abrasions. Tears can occur when the film is stressed during winding or projection, in addition to improper threading.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.filmpreservation.org/userfiles/image/PDFs/fpg_2.pdf|title=Understanding Film and How It Decays|last=|first=|date=2004|website=National Film Preservation Foundation|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Repeated use, including the repeated insertion and removal of film from sleeves can also cause scratches and abrasions. Ignorance, neglect, and carelessness account for a significant percentage of damage to photographs.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

=== Improper chemical processing ===
Major silver deterioration occurs when photographs are not correctly processed and washed. Over time, residual fixer left in the photograph causes the image, binder, and support to turn yellow or brown and the silver image to fade. High temperature and humidity speed this process. Photographs that were not well fixed remain light sensitive and may darken when exposed to light.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

== Nitrate deterioration ==
Cellulose nitrate is chemically unstable; decay is irreversible and autocatalytic. When the film deteriorates, it turns yellow, brittle and sticky. The off-gassing of nitrate produces hazardous and corrosive products (nitrogen oxides form nitric acid) along with an acrid smell that cause fading of the silver image, decomposition of the gelatin binder, and the eventual destruction of the plastic support and image material.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; These products (nitric acid, nitric oxide and nitrogen dioxide) are destructive to other film-based negatives, and especially to photographic prints. Other artifacts, metals for instance, will be harmed by proximity to deteriorated nitrate material. Such gasses can cause skin, eye, and respiratory irritations. Allergic sensitivity has also been noted, as has dizziness and lightheadedness.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cool.conservation-us.org/byauth/messier/negrmcc.html|title=Preserving Your Collection of Film-Based Photographic Negatives|last=Paul|first=Messier,|website=cool.conservation-us.org|access-date=2017-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Nitrate Deterioration.jpg|thumb| A cellulose nitrate negative that has reached the later stages of deterioration; there is no image content remaining.]]

=== Types of deterioration ===

==== Embrittlement ====
Caused by the loss of elasticity in the plastic film base over time. The film can snap or break under strain, and will no longer have flexibility.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://filmcare.org/vd_embrittlement.php|title=FilmCare.org|website=filmcare.org|language=en|access-date=2017-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==== Shrinkage ====
The loss of the original dimensionality of the film and is irreversible.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://filmcare.org/vd_shrinkage.php|title=FilmCare.org|website=filmcare.org|language=en|access-date=2017-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Distortion ====
Distortion is caused by uneven shrinkage across a film's dimension and starts to warp or curl. This can be due to the difference in shrinkage between the film and emulsion layers, or areas of the film that start to shrink more than other areas. Temporary distortion can be reversed, but permanent distortion cannot.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://filmcare.org/vd_distortion.php|title=FilmCare.org|website=filmcare.org|language=en|access-date=2017-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Gelatin and base decomposition ====
As the film is exposed to moisture, heat, and acids, nitrogen oxides are produced, which creates nitric acid. These promote silver corrosion and decompose the gelatin emulsion layer. The chemical reactions that occur cause further nitrate decay. Softness and stickiness occur and the image starts to fade away. This is irreversible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://filmcare.org/vd_binder.php|title=FilmCare.org|website=filmcare.org|language=en|access-date=2017-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Silver mirroring and fading (black and white) ====
When exposed to moisture in the environment and various pollutants, the image silver will corrode, creating a reflective metallic sheen on the emulsion side. Typically starts at the edges of the film. Poor quality enclosures and storage can hasten the process.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://filmcare.org/vd_silvermirroring.php|title=FilmCare.org|website=filmcare.org|language=en|access-date=2017-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Redox blemishes ====
These small pink, orange or yellow spots can found in the image area and are often found in microfilm. These are created by local oxidation of metallic silver due to moisture and pollutants in the environment.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://filmcare.org/vd_redoxblemishes.php|title=FilmCare.org|website=filmcare.org|language=en|access-date=2017-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:N38 pre g 10 1 m.jpg|thumb|Deterioration of a cellulose nitrate negative that has adhered to its enclosure and degenerating.]]

=== Levels of deterioration ===
Deterioration of nitrate film is often categorized in six stages, or levels:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nedcc.org/free-resources/preservation-leaflets/5.-photographs/5.1-a-short-guide-to-film-base-photographic-materials-identification,-care,-and-duplication|title=5.1 A Short Guide to Film Base Photographic Materials: Identification, Care, and Duplication|website=Northeast Document Conservation Center|language=en|access-date=2017-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

* Level 1: No deterioration
* Level 2: The film turns yellow. The silver gelatin can begin to mirror
* Level 3: The film becomes sticky and emits a strong noxious odor (nitric acid)
* Level 4: The film becomes an amber color and the image starts to fade
* Level 5: The film is soft, can adhere to adjacent film, enclosures and other materials
* Level 6: The film degenerates into a brownish acid powder

== Acetate deterioration ==
While considered "safety film" as it produces less hazards than nitrate, cellulose acetate still faces stability issues. The deterioration of acetate is autocatalytic just like nitrate: once the deterioration process starts, the degradation products induce further deterioration.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; If not properly cared for and preserved, cellulose acetate will become acidic, and face many of the same issues that nitrate faces. Deteriorated acetate can also emit a noticeable odor, and can cause the same skin, eye, and respiratory irritations as nitrate does, in addition to dizziness and lightheadedness.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; 

=== Types of deterioration ===
[[File:AD strips.jpg|thumb|AD strips used to monitor the level of acetic acid and negative degradation; testing the level of "vinegar syndrome"]]

==== Vinegar syndrome ====
Vinegar Syndrome is the release of acetic acid which produces a strong vinegary odor.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; [https://www.imagepermanenceinstitute.org/imaging/ad-strips AD strips] are dye-coated paper strips that can detect and measure the severity of vinegar syndrome in film collections. The strips change color, shifting from a blue to green to level, based on the level of acidity found. If the AD strip level remains at blue, the film is in good condition and no deterioration is present. If the AD strip level turns yellow, the film condition is in critical condition, creating a possible handling hazard, and should be frozen immediately.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.imagepermanenceinstitute.org/imaging/ad-strips|title=Image Permanence Institute {{!}} A-D Strips|website=www.imagepermanenceinstitute.org|language=en|access-date=2017-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Embrittlement ====
Caused by the loss of elasticity in the plastic film base over time. The film can snap or break under strain, and will no longer have flexibility.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==== Anti-halation ====
The acetic acid that is released in cellulose acetate negatives can trigger the retrieval of the color dyes in the backing layer, known as the anti-halation layer, giving the negative a blue or pink appearance. This is irreversible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://filmcare.org/vd_antihalation.php|title=FilmCare.org|website=filmcare.org|language=en|access-date=2017-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==== Plasticizer exudation ====
Plasticizer additives that move to the surface of the film and form crystals or bubbles as the acetate film deteriorates. This is irreversible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://filmcare.org/vd_plasticizer_exudation.php|title=FilmCare.org|website=filmcare.org|language=en|access-date=2017-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Shrinkage ====
The loss of the original dimensionality of the film and is irreversible.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

==== Distortion ====
Distortion is caused by uneven shrinkage across a film's dimension and starts to warp or curl. This can be due to the difference in shrinkage between the film and emulsion layers, or areas of the film that start to shrink more than other areas. Temporary distortion can be reversed, but permanent distortion cannot.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;[[File:Acetate Deterioration.jpg|thumb|A cellulose acetate negative that is deteriorating; the gelatin layer is separating from the film support (channeling).]]

==== Channeling and delamination ====
As the film decays, acetic acid is released from the film support, which causes the gelatin layer to separate from the film support. This is a form of advanced acetate decay and can be accompanied by embrittlement and the exudation of plasticizers.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://filmcare.org/vd_delamination.php|title=FilmCare.org|website=filmcare.org|language=en|access-date=2017-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; While delamination is irreversible, skilled professionals can perform conservation treatments to save the image.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

==== Dye fade (color) ====
Found in color films, dye fading reduces the overall density of the image resulting in loss of contrast and shifts in color balance. This is irreversible, however, digital restoration techniques can be used to approximate the original color balance and information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://filmcare.org/vd_dyefade.php|title=FilmCare.org|website=filmcare.org|language=en|access-date=2017-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Silver mirroring and fading (black and white) ====
When exposed to moisture in the environment and various pollutants, the image silver will corrode, creating a reflective metallic sheen on the emulsion side. Typically starts at the edges of the film. Poor quality enclosures and storage can hasten the process.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

==== Redox blemishes ====
These small pink, orange or yellow spots can found in the image area and are often found in microfilm. These are created by local oxidation of metallic silver due to moisture and pollutants in the environment.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

=== Levels of deterioration&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nedcc.org/free-resources/preservation-leaflets/5.-photographs/5.1-a-short-guide-to-film-base-photographic-materials-identification,-care,-and-duplication|title=5.1 A Short Guide to Film Base Photographic Materials: Identification, Care, and Duplication|website=Northeast Document Conservation Center|language=en|access-date=2017-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; ===
Deterioration of cellulose acetate is often categorized into the following levels, or stages:

* Level 1: No deterioration 
* Level 2: Negatives start to curl and anti-halation colors released 
* Level 3: The onset of vinegar syndrome (vinegar odor) as well as shrinkage and brittleness. 
* Level 4: Warping 
* Level 5: Formation of bubbles and crystals 
* Level 6: Formation of channeling 

== Polyester deterioration ==
Because polyester is an inert and stable plastic, it does not possess the same deterioration concerns as celluloid films. Polyester can be stored at room temperature and does not need cold storage for preservation. Polyester is also used as an archival enclosure option for materials, such as [http://www.dictionary.com/browse/mylar Mylar] and Melinex brand products. 

=== Types of deterioration ===

==== Dye fade (color) ====
While polyester film is stable, the chromogenic dyes found in color negatives on polyester supports are not permanent and may fade rapidly at room temperature.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Preventive conservation strategies ==
Preventive conservation actions such as environmental monitoring, good storage, and promoting proper handling through staff and user education, will have a lasting, positive impact on the preservation of a collection.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;
[[File:Data Logger.jpg|thumb|Data logger used to monitor temperature and relative humidity]]

=== Temperature and humidity controls ===
Keeping film cold and dry is ideal; however, a cool environment (40 to 60 degrees) is better than room temperature or higher as it will slow down the deterioration process. The best storage conditions for both black &amp; white and color cellulose acetate film are cold (-15° to 4° C/ 5° to 39° F) and dry (30% to 40% relative humidity) environments for cellulose nitrate, cellulose acetate films in both color and black and white, and color on polyester supports.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Black and white film on polyester supports may be stored at a temperature of 18º C (65º F) or lower and a relative humidity of 30% to 40%.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;[[File:Cold Storage Cabinets.jpg|thumb|An example of storage cabinets within a large walk-in freezer for cold storage of celluloid film.]]

=== Cold storage ===
Freezing film is the ideal temperature to preserve film for the long-term. At freezing temperatures, the natural decomposition of cellulose nitrate and acetate is slowed down. Cold storage is predicted to extend the life of acetate negatives by a factor of ten or more.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
[[File:Archival Housing Materials.jpg|thumb|Archival housing enclosures for film-based materials]] In August 2017, Paramount Pictures opened a state-of-the-art frozen vault, constructed by Pro-Tek Vaults, to house approximately 500,000 reels of film that Paramount has produced since the 1950s and store it at 29 degrees Fahrenheit, freezing the film to stop almost all image deterioration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Hayley C. Cuccinello|title=Freeze-Frame: Paramount To Open The First Frozen Commercial Vault In The U.S.|journal=Forbes.com|date=14 August 2017|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/hayleycuccinello/2017/08/14/freeze-frame-paramount-to-open-the-first-frozen-commercial-vault-in-the-u-s/#702530c554bb}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://lac-group.com/paramount-pictures-pro-tek-featured-forbes/|title=PRO-TEK to develop state-of-the-art film preservation facility with Paramount Pictures (news release November 21, 2016)|access-date=2017-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Storage control ===
Three layers of protection are recommended for the storage of film base photographic materials.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Negatives and positives should be placed in sleeves or envelopes, which are then placed in a box or drawer, and these boxes or drawers on shelves or in a cabinet. Motion picture film and microfilm should be stored in unsealed containers in cabinets or on shelves.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Labels such as acid-free, lignin-free, or buffered do not guarantee that a material is safe to use with photographic materials. Chemically inert papers may be harmful to the photographic image; the only way to be certain of the stability of the paper is to purchase materials that have passed the Photographic Activity Test (PAT).&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nedcc.org/free-resources/preservation-leaflets/5.-photographs/5.6-storage-enclosures-for-photographic-materials|title=5.6 Storage Enclosures for Photographic Materials|website=Northeast Document Conservation Center|language=en|access-date=2017-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also considerations to be made regarding paper or plastic enclosures. Factors such as use, handling, and cost should be considered when selecting archival storage materials.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; There are several resources provided in the external links section below that can assist with the selection of proper storage materials for photographic materials. 

Film materials should be stored in interior rooms away from exterior walls and places that do not have extreme temperature fluctuations. Furthermore, film materials should not be stored near sources of heat (sunlight, radiators, heaters), water (bathrooms, sprinklers), or near chemical or exhaust fumes.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Storage environments should be regularly monitored to check temperature and humidity controls, HVAC systems, and pest-free.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Quantities of nitrate film in excess of 25 pounds are subject to storage and handling standards prescribed by the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/preservation/care/film.html|title=Care, Handling, and Storage of Motion Picture Film - Collections Care (Preservation, Library of Congress)|website=www.loc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2017-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Seriously deteriorated negatives of any type should be isolated from those in good condition.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

=== Light control ===
Photographic materials should always be covered when not in use. Storing film-based materials in containers and boxes will keep light away from the materials. When exhibiting or using these materials, a low light level should be used. The installation of low-UV-emitting bulbs or UV-absorbing fluorescent bulb sleeves can help eliminate this problem. UV filtering window glazing or the installation of window shades may also help. Low- UV-emitting bulbs and sleeves are available from several manufacturers. Light levels in storage areas can also be controlled by the use of timed shut-off switches. Dark cloths or sheets of folder stock (heavyweight paper) or mat board should be available in reading rooms for covering objects when not in use by readers.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

=== Pollution control ===
Air entering the storage area should be filtered and purified to remove particulate and gaseous matter. A well-designed filtration system includes cellulose or fiberglass filters that remove particulate matter, and chemical absorption system that filters out gaseous pollutants. Air filters must be changed regularly to be effective. Air circulation should also be checked periodically.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

=== Handling control ===
When handling film, the user should always have clean hands and wear gloves (cotton or nitrile) to avoid fingerprints or scratches. Always handle the film by the edge to avoid touching the image surface.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Users must be careful when removing film from enclosures to avoid scratches or abrasions. Never force rolled film flat if it is brittle, as it can snap or break. Always work in an uncluttered and clean environment that is well-lit and ventilated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.filmpreservation.org/userfiles/image/PDFs/fpg_3.pdf|title=Film Handling and Inspection|last=|first=|date=2004|website=National Film Preservation Foundation|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;   It's also beneficial to avoid wearing jewelry, such as long necklaces, that can accidentally scratch the film when being examined. Food and drinks should be kept in a separate room or a safe distance from the film materials. It is also advisable to limit exposure times to celluloid film, wear googles and a respirator.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; 

=== Digitization ===
Any negatives that show signs of deterioration should be digitized as soon as possible. Without immediate restoration followed by a change to proper long-term storage, the environmental factors that caused the early signs of damage will continue, leading eventually to irreparable damage and permanent loss of the film’s content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://protekvaults.com/nitrate-and-acetate-film-restoration/|title=Nitrate and acetate film restoration: Is it too late for your film to be restored? (PRO-TEK Vaults Blog)|access-date=2017-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nitrate and safety negatives that need to be handled but are in good condition should still generally be digitized. The digital image can then be used as an access copy while the original remains in cold storage.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; A wide array of digital systems are available for capturing and storing photographic images, and an institution should have a digital preservation policy in place. Digitization requires active management to ensure the digitized copies are not corrupted or lost. There are many factors to consider when digitizing photographic materials.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The Northeast Document Conservation Center provides information and resources on [https://www.nedcc.org/free-resources/digital-preservation Digital Preservation].

=== Duplication ===
Transferring negatives to a more stable support such as polyester is the best way to preserve the longevity of the images.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Conservation treatments ==
Deteriorated film that requires conservation work should be conducted by a photograph conservator. There are several resources available to aid in finding a conservator for your needs, including the [http://www.conservation-us.org/membership/find-a-conservator#.WNVocG8rK70 American Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works (AIC)], the [https://www.nedcc.org/free-resources/preservation-leaflets/7.-conservation-procedures/7.7-choosing-and-working-with-a-conservator Northeast Document Conservation Center (NEDCC)], and the [http://www.ccaha.org/publications/consultant-specialist-database Conservation Center for Art and Historic Artifacts (CCAHA)].

=== Conservation treatments for nitrate ===
It is not recommended to perform conservation treatments on nitrate. The best options are cold storage to prevent further deterioration (especially if the film is found to be in the lower levels of deterioration), digitize the nitrate film, or duplicate the nitrate film onto a more stable support like polyester. If the nitrate is found to be at the higher levels of deterioration, it is recommended that the original nitrate film be destroyed due to the health and safety hazards.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; 

=== Conservation treatments for acetate ===
Cold storage is the best option for preventive conservation of cellulose acetate film as it slows down the deterioration process. As with nitrate, it is also suggested that digitization and duplication efforts are useful in providing access copies. However, it is possible to perform some conservation treatments on acetate film. 

"Stripping" is a technique that is used by trained conservators on channeled acetate film. This process allows the conservator to separate the gelatin emulsion layer from the deteriorating acetate film base in a bath and then reattach or duplicate the gelatin emulsion layer onto another sheet of film. This process is quite tedious and expensive, and not always successful, therefore it is not always a viable option for everyone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://gawainweaver.com/images/uploads/Horvath_AcetateNegativeSurvey.pdf|title=The Acetate Negative Survey|last=Horvath|first=David G.|date=1987|website=Gawain Weaver Art Conservation|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Obstacles in conservation and restoration ==

=== Irreversible damage or deterioration ===
As described above, celluloid materials are chemically unstable and will naturally deteriorate over time.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Once the materials have reached high levels of deterioration, the film often faces irreversible damage, including image loss. It's important to digitize or duplicate these materials before they face irreversible damage.

=== Cost ===
Cold storage (freezers) can be costly and prohibitive for many institutions.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Digitization can also be costly; factors that need to be considered are size and use of collection, space available for storage, and financial resources.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; 

Deteriorated photographs may require specialized conservation treatment by a professional photograph conservator, often a costly, skill-demanding, and time-consuming procedure. For the majority of photographs in research collections, single-item conservation of deteriorated photographs is probably not a feasible or a cost-effective preservation solution.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

=== Access ===
Cold storage can be prohibitive for access due to the acclimation periods required to use the film.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

'''''CraftWorld''''' is a video game released as an alpha on [[Windows Phone Store]] on December 13, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wp7lab.com/news/craft-world-indie-game-launches-windows-phone/ |title=Craft World Indie Game Launches on Windows Phone |accessdate=May 4, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402143413/http://wp7lab.com/news/craft-world-indie-game-launches-windows-phone/ |archivedate=April 2, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://winsource.com/2011/12/14/minecraft-clone-craftworld-now-available-on-wp7/|title=Minecraft-clone Craftworld Now Available on WP7|work=Winsource.com|accessdate=2015-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''CraftWorld'' cites ''[[Minecraft]]'', ''[[Infiniminer]]'' and ''[[The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion]]'' as direct inspirations for the game. The game utilizes textured [[voxel]]s to simulate blended biomes based on temperature.

The game currently has two versions, paid and free, with a third mode (beta) to be added. Both the free and paid versions have been updated to version 2.5, which includes many new features, such as enemy characters that will attack the player. Crafting, building and collecting have all been added in the recent versions.

==Ports==
It has been announced that ''CraftWorld'' was to be released on the [[Xbox Live]] [[Xbox Live Marketplace|Marketplace]] and on the Seb P's iPad in June 2012.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} The Xbox 360 version of ''CraftWorld'', called ''Block World'' on the platform, was released on [[Xbox Live Indie Games]] on August 17, 2012.

In 2006, Madhouse's parent company [[Index Holdings]] invested 600 million yen.&lt;ref name="Company History"&gt;{{cite web |date= |last= |first= |publisher=DR Movie |accessdate=2009-06-11 |url=http://www.drmovie.biz/english/company3.htm |title=DR Movie Company History |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090220230959/http://www.drmovie.biz/english/company3.htm |archivedate=2009-02-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; DR Movie has been responsible for the animation production end of several Madhouse anime, starting with ''[[Tenjho Tenge]]'' in 2004 and continuing notably with ''[[Claymore (manga)#Anime|Claymore]]'' in 2007.

==Development==

''Dance Dance Revolution Hottest Party 2'' was announced on May 15, 2008 alongside ''[[Dance Dance Revolution Universe 3]]'' and ''[[Dance Dance Revolution X]]'' by Konami on the DDR Online Community website as part of [[Game Day 2008]]. A sequel to the 2007 ''[[Dance Dance Revolution Hottest Party]]'', Hottest Party 2 features many improvements. Konami promises an entirely new soundtrack featuring music from the "last four decades", more innovative [[Wii Remote]] and Nunchuk support, four-player multiplayer and brand new gameplay modes. Hottest Party 2 features a difficulty range that allows both new players and seasoned dancers to enjoy the game. [[Mii]] support will be added to the game, allowing players to incorporate their Mii avatars onto the dance floor. Courses, a mode featured in the mainstream ''Dance Dance Revolution'' series, will be introduced on the Wii for the first time. Dance gimmicks such as Triple Stomp and Dance N' Defend Battle Mode will add new dynamics to the standard gameplay. New dancing characters will be introduced and the dancers will show off realistic dance moves that players can watch and practice in special mode. New dancing stages with greater detail will be added to the game, more than 50 total environments for the characters to dance in. Konami also announced a sample of the music to be included in Hottest Party 2, including covers of "[[Black or White]]" by [[Michael Jackson]], [[Umbrella (song)|Umbrella]]" by [[Rihanna]], "[[We Got the Beat]]" by [[The Go-Go's]], and the inclusion of [[Justice (band)|Justice]]'s [[D.A.N.C.E.]]&lt;ref name="ddroc.hp2"/&gt; A teaser trailer and a series of gameplay screenshots were released by Konami alongside the announcement.&lt;ref name="ddroc.hp2media"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ddronlinecommunity.com/forums/8/forum_topics/298 |title=DDR Hottest Party 2 Media |accessdate=2008-08-02 |author=DDRcommunity |work=DDR Online Community |publisher=Konami |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080720152852/http://www.ddronlinecommunity.com/forums/8/forum_topics/298 |archivedate=2008-07-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 1, 2008 The ''Dance Dance Revolution Hottest Party 2'' teaser website was updated with a new trailer revealing additional information about the upcoming game, alongside the new song "Into Your Heart", by series producer Naoki Maeda. The updated dancers with new dance moves are featured, along with the detailed stages featuring club style lighting, video walls and live crowds, new gimmicks that shrink the size of the on-screen arrows to varying degrees, the first appearance of Training Mode on the Wii, Dance N' Defend Battle Mode in action and the 360 degree dancing character viewer.&lt;ref name="hp2website"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.konami.jp/bemani/ddr/na/gs/hp2/ |title=Dance Dance Revolution Hottest Party 2 |accessdate=2008-05-18 |publisher=Konami}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gameplay==
{{Main|Gameplay of Dance Dance Revolution}}

Gameplay remains relatively unchanged from the original game, as players must step on the marked arrows on a dance pad controller, or wave their [[Wii Remote]] or Nunchuck when the corresponding arrow or hand marker passes through a set of static arrows on-screen to the beat of a song. When played with the Wii Remote, a separate "hand combo" attached to the lifebar increases if the player can keep the beat of the song with the controller while in play. These hand combos can add a bonus to the player's score when a hand marker is eventually reached.&lt;ref name="hp2website"/&gt;&lt;ref name="worthplayingreview" /&gt;

New modes on Hottest Party 2 include a battle mode&lt;ref name="ddroc.hp2"/&gt; and the "Groove Arena", an updated version of Groove Circuit from the previous version. As with the previous game, songs can also contain special "gimmick" arrows with unique behaviors. New arrow gimmicks on ''Hottest Party 2'' include arrows that rebound when hit and must be hit three times in order for them to fully disappear, and arrows that only appear suddenly,.&lt;ref name="ddroc.hp2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="worthplayingreview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worthplaying.com/article.php?sid=56317|title=Wii Review- 'DanceDanceRevolution Hottest Party 2'|date=October 3, 2008|publisher=WorthPlaying|accessdate=2008-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Soundtrack album===
The [[original soundtrack]] for FuruFuru Party was bundled with the original soundtrack for ''[[Dance Dance Revolution X]]'', and was released on January 29, 2009. It was part of the pre-order bundles for the PlayStation 2 version of DDR X in Japan, which was released the same day.&lt;ref name="ddrxbundle"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bemanistyle.com/index.php/news/konamistyle-updates-1185 |title=konamistyle updates |date=2008-12-15 |publisher=Bemanistyle |accessdate=2008-12-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217102413/http://www.bemanistyle.com/index.php/news/konamistyle-updates-1185 |archivedate=2008-12-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Compatibility==
It has been discovered that DDR Hottest Party 2 is not compatible with some 3rd party dance mats made for ''[[Dance Dance Revolution Mario Mix]]'' and 3rd party mats made for ''[[Dance Dance Revolution Hottest Party]]''.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} Cable converters, such as those made by DDR Game, exist to get around this issue.&lt;ref name=converter&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ddrgame.com/wii-accessory-hp3-dance-pad-cable-adapter.html|title=Nintendo Wii Dance Pad Cable Converter for DDR Hottest Party 2 and Hottest Party 3 |publisher=DDR Game |accessdate=2010-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is compatible with most Gamecube pads, even when used as 2nd/3rd/4th player.

==Reception==
[[File:Dance Dance Revolution Hottest Party 2 gameplay 2.png|thumb|250px|left|A pre-release screenshot of ''Hottest Party 2'' displaying a Mii as a dancing character.]]

During its presentation at [[E3 2008]], critics praised ''Hottest Party 2'' for its ease of play. Chris Watters of [[GameSpot]] felt the training modes would be useful for newer players to learn the game's fundamentals,&lt;ref name="e32008.gamespot"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.gamespot.com/wii/puzzle/dancedancerevolutionhottestparty2/news.html?sid=6194174 |title=E3 2008: Dance Dance Revolution: Hottest Party 2 Hands-On |accessdate=2008-08-02 |author=Chris Watters |date=2008-07-16 |publisher=GameSpot}}&lt;/ref&gt; and while [[IGN]]'s Lucas M. Thomas noted that ''Hottest Party 2'' was not "drastically different" from the previous version (continuing a model of releasing yearly installments with greater emphasis on new content rather than making larger changes to the game), he still felt the game remained just as accessible to new players as earlier entries in the franchise, and sarcastically commented that the ability to have [[Mii]] heads on realistic bodies as dancers "doesn't look disturbing at all."&lt;ref name="e32008.ign"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://wii.ign.com/articles/891/891494p1.html |title=E3 2008: Feet-on Dance Dance Revolution: Hottest Party 2 |accessdate=2008-08-02 |author=Lucas M. Thomas |date=2008-07-17 |publisher=IGN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[1UP.com]] gave ''Hottest Party 2'' a "B" rating, concluding that the game "succeeds in several areas where last year's version fell short." Specific praise went to its use of full choreography for the on-screen characters rather than randomized moves, and to its soundtrack contained fewer "generic" songs than the previous game. The game's Battle mode was considered to be a "positively nightmarish" experience, and the ''Groove Arena'' mode was singled out for providing a "rewarding sense of progress" through its pace of providing new content.&lt;ref name=1upreview&gt;{{cite web|last=Walker|first=Torrey|title=Dance Dance Revolution: Hottest Party 2 Review|url=http://www.1up.com/reviews/dance-dance-revolution-hottest-party|publisher=1UP.com|accessdate=14 June 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515174414/http://www.1up.com/reviews/dance-dance-revolution-hottest-party|archivedate=15 May 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

WorthPlaying.com's Jesse Littlefield gave the game a 6.6/10, complimenting some of the additions to gameplay and Wii Remote support. However, the stages and characters were dubbed "poorly detailed" and the covered songs were declared to be "sub-standard", although the Konami Originals were considered the "better half" of the soundtrack. The lack of online play was also criticized.&lt;ref name="worthplayingreview"/&gt;

'''DarkOrbit''', later renamed to '''DarkOrbit: Reloaded''' is a [[massively multiplayer online game]] developed by [[Bigpoint Games]]. The game is set in outer space, where players control a spaceship to battle against [[non-player characters]] and other players. It is a three-dimensional isometric [[Adobe Flash|Flash]] game with over 100 million registered accounts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DarkOrbit main page|url=https://www.darkorbit.com|work=DarkOrbit.com|publisher=Bigpoint|accessdate=5 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
DarkOrbit was released on December 11, 2006, based on deleted [[WildTangent]]'s game with the same name.

Originally this game was created for German players.

== Gameplay ==
At the start of the game, the player chooses between three companies : Venus Resources Unlimited (VRU), Earth Industries Corporation (EIC) and Mars Mining Operations (MMO). In the story, one more company exists (Saturn Autonomous Technology) but not for the players.&lt;ref name=registration&gt;{{cite web|title=DarkOrbit registration|url=http://help.bigpoint.com/index.es?site=login&amp;sid=09deb5cd4bff6aca3195ba7ae19f6ec3|work=DarkOrbit Help|publisher=Bigpoint|accessdate=23 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Players are teleported to the home map to begin quests from Mission Control.

The object of the game is to gain wealth and power both individually and for the company.

=== Top User Points ===

This is a formula that will divide your Experience by 100,000 and Honor by 100, which will equal your top user points. Top user points show up in the hall of fame.

=== Rank Points ===
[[File:Rank list.jpg|thumb|Table of DarkOrbit ranks]]
Rank points are also based on a mathematical formula that is figured by a variety of factors, such as experience, level, honor, quests finished, Ships Points destroyed, Alien Points destroyed, and your ship type. There are also factors that will reduce your rank points such as times destroyed, own company kills, radiation zone destructions, and phoenix (starter) ships destroyed. Rank Points do not show up in the hall of fame.

=== Economy ===
DarkOrbit uses two types of [[Virtual economy|currencies]]: credits and uridium. Uridium, common abbreviated "Uri", is more valuable and harder to obtain. Some types of equipment and ammunition can be purchased using credits, however the most valuable or "elite" items can only be bought with uridium.&lt;ref name=pcworld /&gt;  However, for some of those elite items, there is an option to bid using credits. This auction system is used to control inflation of credits.&lt;ref name=trade&gt;{{cite web|title=Trading post|url=http://help.bigpoint.com/index.es?site=handel&amp;sid=09deb5cd4bff6aca3195ba7ae19f6ec3|work=DarkOrbit Help|publisher=Bigpoint|accessdate=23 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Many new items are not offered in trade. The P.E.T. 10 is a highly priced drone that increases with costs as the player levels it up. Ship designs are also available in the auction.However, certain valuable equipment such as Drone designs or Elite laser ammo are not available in the auction.
Uridium can be purchased in exchange for real money via PayPal, credit card, or another method of payment. Uridium can't be traded.

=== Combat ===
DarkOrbit utilizes a real-time combat system. In combat, a variety of weapons can be used to destroy aliens and other players. These include laser cannons, laser ammunition, rockets, rocket launchers, and mines. Players need to click on their target to lock on before they can begin shooting. Successfully destroying an enemy will result in a "cargo box" containing ore being dropped that the player can take. ''If the destroyed ship is a player, it will cost 500 Uridium to repair the ship, although the ship started with in the game is free to repair.'' This was available only before Darkorbit Reloaded. At the moment, you can choose to repair your ship for free, spawning at your home base, paying 700 Uridium (or one repair credit + 200 Uridium) to spawn at the nearest portal on the map (note that on 4-x maps there are not demilitarized zones, so be careful), or you can pay 800 Uridium (or one repair credit + 300 Uridium) to spawn at the same spot your ship got destroyed.

Players start of the game with a Phoenix, a free but easily destroyed ship. As the player advances in the game, he/she can buy better ships. There are a total of 53 different ships that can be bought, with the Goliath, the Aegis, the Citadel, and the Vengeance typically being regarded as the best ships. Some ships can only be purchased with real money during special events. Ships can be equipped with a variety of items, including shield generators, speed engines, laser cannons, rocket launchers, ammunition, and many other accessories.

=== Clans ===
Players can join a clan if they pay 1,500 credits. Benefits of joining a clan include help from clan mates and clan payouts in the form of credits. However, most clans have a clan tax (between 0% and 5%) that is collected into the clans treasury daily. Clans can help players level up, gain credits and compete against other rivals. In addition, a player can found a clan for 300,000 credits. There is also a page in the game that allows you to see which clan players are online, if they are ready for action on your map or if they are offline. The menu also allows you to invite them into  group without having to write their name.&lt;ref name=pcworld&gt;{{cite web|last=Robota|first=Damian|title=Kostenfalle Online-Spiele|url=http://www.pcwelt.de/news/PC-WELT-enthuellt-Kostenfalle-Online-Spiele-130183.html|publisher=PC Welt|accessdate=22 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=clan&gt;{{cite web|title=Clan|url=http://help.bigpoint.com/index.es?site=clan&amp;sid=09deb5cd4bff6aca3195ba7ae19f6ec3|work=DarkOrbit Help|publisher=Bigpoint|accessdate=23 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
also if you are part of a clan member you can have wars with others and fight against.

=== Skylab ===
The Skylab is a system used to produce and refine ores, such as Prometium, Endurium, and Terbium. These basic ores can be refined to Prometid and Duranium, which when combined with Xenomit can make Promerium. There is also a crystal named Seprom that can only be produced in the Skylab by further refining Promerium. Seprom cannot be sold however the ore can give weapons and shields a great power boost. These ores can then be sent to the player's ship and either sold for credits or equipped to enhance the ship.&lt;ref name=skylab&gt;{{cite web|title=Skylab|url=http://help.bigpoint.com/index.es?site=skylab&amp;sid=09deb5cd4bff6aca3195ba7ae19f6ec3|work=DarkOrbit Help|publisher=Bigpoint|accessdate=23 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The highest level is 20 for upgrading your Skylab.

=== Pilot Sheet ===
The Pilot Bio is a very powerful skill tree designed to give players extra advantages in-game. Pilot points are needed to work the Pilot Bio. Pilot Points can be obtained by buying log disks from the shop, shooting down boss or uber NPC's for a small chance, or even by completing Galaxy Gates. Each pilot point can be used to acquire certain [[Character point|abilities]] that help the player in battle or other game functions. A player can have up to fifty pilot points in their bio. When certain skills are maxed out, they generate special effects, such as brighter lasers, rocket trails, etc.&lt;ref name=pilotbio&gt;{{cite web|title=Pilot Bio|url=http://help.bigpoint.com/index.es?site=pilotsheet&amp;sid=09deb5cd4bff6aca3195ba7ae19f6ec3|work=DarkOrbit Help|publisher=Bigpoint|accessdate=23 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Most pilot points a player can spend is 50.

=== Galaxy Gates ===
For 100 Uridium or from Palladium, a resource which is converted into extra energy, players can "spin" a galaxy Gate Generator, which gives ammunition, free repairs, or parts for a "galaxy gate". Once you collect enough parts to build one of the many galaxy gates, you are sent through a portal into a map where enemies cannot reach you, only NPCs. Once in, the only way out is to be shot down, or to destroy the entire "wave" of aliens. These waves get progressively harder throughout the duration of the gate; they also become more difficult depending on the gate you have active. The reward for completing a gate without being shot down more than twice is quite substantial.

=== LoW Gate ===
Also called the Outfit Gate, the Lord of War map is found on every x-3 map. To enter this gate, one must be in an outfit. Once in the gate, players find there is no way out - they must "finish" the gate. The goal is to energize four probes at the corners of the map; once this is accomplished, the station at the center of the map gains the ability to heal any player that goes within range. In addition, a considerable horde of aliens spawns, along with the Century Falcon. Killing this extremely tough NPC awards the player the achievement "Falconer" and ejects them from the map. All destructions inside the map result in free repairs.

== Special Events ==

DarkOrbit has special events from time to time that can give players special rewards.

=== Jackpot Arena ===
Jackpot Arena is a monthly event on the second Sunday of every month, in which all players who sign up fight each other in 1 vs 1 until only one ship is left surviving. The winning player will receive real cash up to €10,000.&lt;ref name=jackpot&gt;{{cite web|title=Jackpot|url=http://help.bigpoint.com/index.es?site=jackpot&amp;sid=09deb5cd4bff6aca3195ba7ae19f6ec3|work=DarkOrbit Help|publisher=Bigpoint|accessdate=23 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  from DarkOrbit, based on how many "Jackpot euros" they had. Jackpot dollars can be found in bonus boxes that are scattered across space.

The Jackpot Arena has been suspended permanently. There are plans on re-introducing the Jackpot Arena, however it will not contain real-life prices.
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bigpoint.com/darkorbit/board/threads/note-from-the-producer-on-jpa-on-hold.105955/#post-858219 Jackpot Arena suspended]. Darkorbit Forums.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Team Death Match ===
The Team Death Match is an event that in which five ships from one company work together to kill five ships from an enemy company. The winning team receives rewards at the end and is taken to the next level. This keeps on continuing until you die (or your team loses).

=== Spaceball ===
Spaceball is an event that takes place in the map 4-4, with the objective of scoring goals by shooting an NPC ball to your x-5 portal.  After a goal has been scored cargo boxes are released around the portal containing assorted prizes such as uridium, ammunition, and jackpot dollars. The winning company wins prizes for 24 hours the next day such as x%EP, honor, bonus box rewards, and cargo selling price.

=== Invasion ===
A event that is taken place in different maps, depending on your level. This event is made up of waves, each wave harder to pass than the one before. This event lets you rack up millions of credits and thousands of uridium. Repairs are free as long as you die in the invasion map.

For levels 5-9 an invasion gate appears in the middle of x-1, in x-3 a gate appears for all those between levels 10-14 and in x-5 all players at levels 15 and above have to enter invasion here. The gate in x-1 typically contains NPCs that are easier to kill and they get harder as you move to the higher gates. You are unable to log out when in the invasion gate, the only way out is if your ship is destroyed, or you level beyond the parameters of the gate.

=== Capture The Beacon ===
Capture The Beacon, like the traditional game capture the flag, is an event where all 3 companies have beacons in their x-2 maps which must be protected by the defending company, and captured by the attacking company, and taken back to their own x-2 map.
Games are 1 hour long, company with most points gets a 1-hour prize such as x% more experience, honor, bonus box rewards, etc.

=== Scoremageddon ===
Players fight in PvP battles to gain points. You gain more points based on your combo, which rises as you kill other enemy players. The top 50 in points at the end will win various prizes such as UCB-100, PLD-8, Special Mines, and even Uridium. You lose a life every time you die from an original total of 5. Once all of your lives are depleted you are eliminated and can no longer earn more points (you are also not worth any for enemy players that destroy you)

=== Infiltration ===
NPCs will spawn every 10 minutes. The objective is to destroy all NPCs to earn a point for your company. The NPCs have camouflage and are marked as yellow on the minimap. Every map, except x-1, have varying amounts of NPCs, and once they are all destroyed there will be a message to all players on the map saying all the Infiltrators have been destroyed.

=== Birthday Gate ===
To commemorate the date that DarkOrbit went online, every year on December 11, a gate appears on the home map, given free to all players. Weakened aliens, usually at half-strength, are found in the gate. The rewards are not as large as other gates, since the enemies are weaker.
They also give you 35.000 uridium.

'''Dark cabaret''' may be a simple description of the theme and mood of a [[cabaret]] performance, but more recently has come to define a particular [[Music genre|musical genre]] which draws on the aesthetics of the decadent, risqué German [[Weimar Republic|Weimar-era]] cabarets, [[burlesque]] and [[vaudeville]] shows with the stylings of post-1970s [[Goth subculture|goth]] and [[Punk subculture|punk]] music.

==Sources==
[[Cabaret]] proper had long associations with counter-culture and dealt with disturbing themes, as exemplified by ''[[The Threepenny Opera]]'' by [[Bertolt Brecht]] and [[Kurt Weill]], with one of its best known songs "[[Mack the Knife]]" ("''Moritat von Mackie Messer''") which tells the story of a murderous [[anti-hero]], or the 1933 song "[[Gloomy Sunday]]" ("''Szomorú Vasárnap''") by Hungarian composer [[Rezső Seress]] with the more recent [[urban legend]]s which have grown up around it. It was therefore natural that later artists drew upon it for inspiration: [[Nico]]'s 1974 album ''[[The End...]]'' is an early example of such influence,{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} especially in songs such as "You Forgot to Answer" and "Secret Side", while influenced artists associated with goth and punk music specifically include [[Nina Hagen]],&lt;ref&gt;"The Seven Addictions and Five Professions of Anita Berber" Mel Gordon ''Voluptuous Panic: The Erotic World of Weimar Berlin'' (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sex Gang Children]] and [[The Virgin Prunes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mute.com/virgin-prunes/virgin-prunes-a-short-history|title=MUTE • Virgin Prunes • Virgin Prunes: A Short History|author=|date=|website=mute.com|accessdate=16 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dark cabaret as a style==
One of the earliest bands to play mainly or exclusively in a style which might now be described as dark cabaret were the [[Tiger Lillies]], formed in London in 1989. In the 1980s satirical cabaret had been revived and popularised by London-based bands such as [[Fascinating Aïda]] and [[Kit and The Widow]] but the Tiger Lillies incorporated themes of [[blasphemy]], [[prostitution]] and [[bestiality]] in their songs, sung by [[Martyn Jacques]] in a menacing style with a [[falsetto]] voice.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Goldsmith ''Criminal Castrati'' New York Press, 13 May 1998, quoted at http://www.tigerlillies.com, retrieved 4 June 09&lt;/ref&gt; A collaboration between [[Rozz Williams]] and [[Gitane Demone]] - both former members of [[Christian Death]] - entitled ''[[Dream Home Heartache]]'' after a [[In Every Dream Home a Heartache|song by Roxy Music]], was recorded in the Netherlands and released in the United States in 1995 and was described by reviewers as "cabaret ''noir''"&lt;ref&gt;Gitane Demone interviewed by Matthew Moyer, 1998/1999, http://www.ink19.com&lt;/ref&gt; or "glam cabaret".&lt;ref&gt;Rozz Williams interviewed by Johnny Walker, ''Vibe'', 1997, at http://thebluehour.free.fr&lt;/ref&gt; Following her 1996 debut solo album ''Quintessentially Unreal'', San Francisco-based singer/pianist [[Jill Tracy]] released her second CD, ''Diabolical Streak'', in 1999. Canada's ''[[Shift (magazine)|Shift]]'' magazine called the album one of the "Top 10 Neo-Cabaret albums of all time."{{citation needed|date=June 2009}}

==Emergence of the genre==
[[File:Amanda Palmer, Auckland, 2.jpg|thumb|right|145px|The Dresden Dolls' Amanda Palmer]]
The term ''dark cabaret'' appears to have become popularized with the release of a 2005 compilation album entitled ''Projekt Presents: A Dark Cabaret'' by [[Projekt Records]], a label chiefly associated with the [[dark wave]] genre.&lt;ref&gt;Reviews of ''A Dark Cabaret'' quoted at {{cite web|title=Projekt.com: Darkwave|url=http://www.projekt.com/projekt/product.asp?sku=PRO00176|accessdate=13 November 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101128235844/http://www.projekt.com/projekt/product.asp?sku=PRO00176|archivedate=28 November 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The album included "Flowers" from ''Dream Home Heartache'' sung by Rozz Williams together with, among others, "Evil Night Together" by [[Jill Tracy]],  "Sometimes, Sunshine" by Revue Noir, and "[[Coin-Operated Boy]]" by [[The Dresden Dolls]]. Formed by [[Amanda Palmer]] and [[Brian Viglione]] in 2000, The Dresden Dolls described their music as "Brechtian punk cabaret", a term coined by Amanda Palmer in early 2003 in part to preclude being labelled by the media as goths.&lt;ref&gt;Speer, Deborah "The Dresden Dolls" Pollstar, 3 April 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, with their musical style and appearance in white face makeup and reduced period clothing, The Dresden Dolls and their fans quickly became the most readily identified with the newly evident dark cabaret genre,&lt;ref&gt;''The Guardian'' Culture, review of ''Yes Virginia'' by Betty Clarke, 14 April 2006: https://www.theguardian.com/music/2006/apr/14/popandrock.shopping1&lt;/ref&gt; garnering the most mainstream attention. Subsequently, bands began categorising themselves and their performance as dark cabaret, such as [[San Diego|San Diego's]] The Tragic Tantrum in the US,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tragictantrum.com/presskit/ retrieved 8 June 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Katzenjammer Kabarett in France, or Ray Childish in [[Graz]], [[Austria]].&lt;ref&gt;Ray Childish on MySpace Music http://www.myspace.com/raychildish retrieved 11 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

New sects of dark cabaret have emerged from the previous theatrical dark cabaret. With a more aggressive side and a punk or metal background, with some bands also closely associated with the punk cabaret subgenre, for example: [[Stolen Babies]] or [[Harlequin Jones]].{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

The appearance of an identifiable dark cabaret scene coincided with the rise of [[Neo-Burlesque]] starting in the 1990s. The two have become linked following the appearance of performers such as the Chicago burlesque orchestra ''Apartment'' (1997–2005) and the emergence of [[gothic bellydance]]. Collaboration with burlesque performers was given by Brian Viglione as the inspiration for The Dresden Dolls' look.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Pope]] (Director) (2004) ''The Rise and Times of The Dresden Dolls'' [DVD] 8-ft Records&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3555">'''Douglas''' (hatched c. 1967) is the male [[scarlet macaw]] that played the parrot ''Rosalinda'' in the 1970 [[Pippi Longstocking]] movie [[Pippi in the South Seas (film)|''Pippi in the South Seas'']].

Douglas was imported from Brazil to Sweden in 1967. Three years later he starred as the female parrot ''Rosalinda'' in the popular movie ''Pippi in the South Seas''. Douglas is capable of singing and of speaking a few dozen words. In 2002, 32 years after the movie, Douglas garnered a lot of attention in the Swedish press, when the authorities were considering to put him to death due to its owner at the time not having the proper paperwork. A petition pleading for Douglas' life comprised over 50,000 signatures including one by the actress [[Inger Nilsson]], who played Pippi in the 1970 movie. Ultimately Douglas was spared after its first owner in Sweden produced the proper paper work, showing that he was legally imported from Brazil in 1967.&lt;ref name=spon1&gt;Sigrid Harms: [http://www.spiegel.de/panorama/malmoe-papagei-aus-pippi-langstrumpf-film-soll-sterben-a-1086025.html Papagei aus „Pippi Langstrumpf“: Douglas muss sterben]. [[Spiegel Online]], 7 April 2016 (German)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tagesspiegel&gt;[http://www.tagesspiegel.de/weltspiegel/tierischer-filmstar-aus-schweden-pippis-papagei-darf-weiterleben-in-karlsruhe/13450928.html Pippis Papagei darf weiterleben – in Karlsruhe]. [[Der Tagesspiegel]], 14 April 2016 (German)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005 Douglas moved to a small zoo in [[Malmö]], where he lived together with a female [[blue-and-yellow macaw]] called ''Gojan'' until 2016. Early in 2016 Douglas once more attracted the attention of the Swedish media and later of the German one as well. Swedish authorities had again plans to put Douglas to death due to its cage of 3 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; being too small and not allowing him to fly. The authorities requested an [[aviary]] of at least 30 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, which the zoo couldn't provide. The zoo's director Frank Madsen tried to get an exception arguing that due to its very old age Douglas was incapable of flying anyhow and that it made no sense to cut short his remaining final years. As the authorities were unwilling to grant an exception, Madsen turned to the press and received soon over 100 offers for a new home for Douglas and Gojan. Ultimately the [[Karlsruhe Zoo]] in [[Germany]] was selected and in April Madsen himself delivered Douglas and Gojan to Karlsruhe, where they were greeted with a public welcome party.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.taz.de/!5301680/ ''Pippis Papagei'']. Taz, 17 May 2016 (German)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tagesspiegel/&gt;&lt;ref name=spon1/&gt;

Five months later in September 2016 Gojan died at an age of 45 and the zoo is planning to pair Douglas with another macaw.&lt;ref name=spon2&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/panorama/papagei-aus-pippi-langstrumpf-ara-douglas-lebt-jetzt-allein-a-1113673.html '' Papagei aus "Pippi Langstrumpf" - Ara Douglas ist jetzt Witwer ''].

'''Dr. Sketchy's Anti-Art School''' is both a [[burlesque]] [[cabaret]] and [[life drawing]] event originating in [[Williamsburg, Brooklyn|Williamsburg]], [[Brooklyn]], at the Lucky Cat.  Dr. Sketchy's was founded in [[New York City]] in 2005, by [[illustrator]] and former artist's model [[Molly Crabapple]] and illustrator [[A.V. Phibes]] who later left to attend to her design studio.&lt;ref name=NewYorkTimes&gt;Kino, Carol (October 2, 2009).

Described as a cross between an old-fashioned life-drawing session and a new-wave cabaret, it usually meets every other Saturday at [[the Slipper Room]], a burlesque-themed bar on Orchard Street in Manhattan (though Crabapple has held it at other locations like Times Square), where approximately 50 artists, web designers, cartoonists and hipsters pay $12 each to draw a downtown personalities such as alternative model Raquel Reed or performance artist Amber Ray.&lt;ref name=NewYorkTimes/&gt; In a typical sketching session, artists will drink alcohol, sketch burlesque models, and play art games in a bar or venue like an art museum.  Crabapple will often travel around the world visiting different Dr. Sketchy's.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, Jennifer (2010).

Retrieved June 14, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2009 there are branches of Dr. Sketchy's Anti-Art School all over the world.&lt;ref name=NewYorkTimes/&gt;
  
''The Official Dr. Sketchy's Rainy Day Colouring Book'', by Molly Crabapple and John Leavitt, was released by Sepulculture Books in December 2006, and is in its second printing.  Other projects include a 2008 pin-up calendar, a series of YouTube comedy shorts, a national tour, an art show, and a 21-show run at the [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe]].

In 2010, a short documentary by Peter Bolte was made about ''Dr. Sketchy''.

Despite conservatism in continents such as Asia, Dr. Sketchy's appears to be widely accepted in Tokyo, Singapore and the Philippines.  The Singapore branch is headlined by the zesty{{weasel word|date=May 2014}} Becca D'Bus.  The Philippine branch is one of Crabapple's favorite new branches.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dontpaniconline.com/magazine/arts/molly-crabapple/ MOLLY CRABAPPLE] on [http://www.dontpaniconline.com Don't Panic Online Magazine]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Album information==
The cast album includes highlights from the musical's score; many numbers were truncated or excised in order to fit onto one long-playing vinyl record. A 2006 special edition remastered version, issued to tie-in with both the musical's 25th anniversary and the [[DreamWorks]]/[[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]]-produced [[Dreamgirls (film)|''Dreamgirls'' feature film adaptation]], adds three previously unissued tracks from the original recording sessions.

Pop music producer [[David Foster]] served as producer of the cast album, which peaked at #11 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], while peaking at #4 on Billboard's [[Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums|Black Albums Chart]]. It is the highest charting Broadway Cast Recording in history on the Billboard 200. http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6114223/idina-menzels-ifthen-scores-show-stopping-chart-debut  In 1983, the album won the [[Grammy Award for Best Musical Show Album]], and [[Jennifer Holliday]] received the [[Grammy Award for Best Female R&amp;B Vocal Performance|Grammy Award for Best R&amp;B Vocal Performance, Female]] for "And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going".

In 1993, the album was certified [[gold record|gold]] by the [[RIAA]], and to date has sold over 500,000 copies in the US.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2109">[[Image:GAMALogo.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Logo of the Game Manufacturers Association.]]
The '''Game Manufacturers Association''' ('''GAMA''') is a [[non-profit]] [[trade association]] based in [[Columbus, Ohio]], dedicated to the advancement of the non-electronic social [[game]]s [[industry]] - Board/Tabletop Games, Miniatures Games, Card Games, Collectable/Tradeable Card Games, Role-Playing Games, and Live-Action Role Playing Games. Its members are game manufacturers, retailers, distributors, suppliers, conventions, clubs, and independent professionals related to the games industry.

The association was formed in 1977 to protect the interests of the [[Origins Game Fair]], and was incorporated as a non-profit venture in 1982.

GAMA organizes two shows each year, the GAMA Trade Show (GTS) in [[Reno, Nevada]] - a professional trade show aimed at game retailers, and the [[Origins Game Fair]] in [[Columbus, Ohio]] - a 15,000 person consumer show that is aimed at the game-playing public. 

GAMA has a number of programs designed to advance hobby games as a business. The Games in Education program strives to teach educators how they can use games in their curricula. The retailer mentoring program is aimed at helping new game stores become successful businesses. The Industry Watch Committee helps stores and publishers deal with negative press about games. In all they do, they endeavor to strengthen the business of publishing and selling games.

In 2006 GAMA began the Games to Troops program, working with the [[Morale, Welfare and Recreation|MWR]] offices of all four US military service branches to establish a permanent games library at every MWR station on the US front lines. The social games industry has since sent over a quarter of a million dollars in games to the US troops through this program.

'''Giovanni Gabrielli''' (died between 1603 and 1611) was an Italian actor of the ''[[commedia dell'arte]]'', who performed under the name '''Sivello'''.&lt;ref name=LS&gt;Senelick, Laurence, p. 407 ("Gabrielli family") in Banham 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Gabrielli was particularly famous for portraying several characters talking together in different languages.&lt;ref name=LS/&gt; The 18th-century historian [[Francesco Saverio Quadrio]] relates that Gabrielli was able to impersonate women with his voice only, without the benefit of a costume change.&lt;ref&gt;Quadrio 1744, [https://archive.org/stream/bub_gb_20QBQ9HA22AC#page/n242/mode/1up p. 239], cited by Askew 1978, p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt; His portrait was engraved by [[Agostino Carracci]].&lt;ref&gt;Rasi 1897, [http://hdl.handle.net/2027/coo.31924091763502?urlappend=%3Bseq=435 vol. 1, p. 955].&lt;/ref&gt;

His son [[Francesco Gabrielli]] was also a well known actor.&lt;ref name=LS/&gt;

==Publications==
Two works of Gabrielli were published in Bologna in the early 17th century:&lt;ref&gt;Mahon 1947, p. 234, note 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Heroes of Kalevala''' is a [[puzzle game]] for mobile devices created by a Finnish game company 10tons Ltd. The game is a combination of [[tile-matching]] and [[City-building game|city-building]], with a well illustrated story behind it. The story is loosely based on [[Kalevala]], the [[national epic]] of [[Finland]].

Heroes of Kalevala was released in 2010 and works for [[iOS]], [[Android (operating system)|Android]], [[Windows]] and other [[mobile phone|mobile]] platforms. It uses [[match-3]] mechanics for tile matching and has over 140 hand-made [[Level (video gaming)|levels]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.10tons.com/Game/heroes_of_kalevala.html 10tons Heroes of Kalevala]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
The game begins when a drought hits your village and the village elders tell you to travel across the sea to start a new colony, at the land of Kalevala. Once you've found your new land, you must grow your village and keep your dwellers happy.

The player must collect coins to build new buildings and decoration to the village, by completing puzzles. When you've earned a certain amount of coins, you also attract heroes to help you protect the village from the evil crow sent to burn your village.

'''''King of Kensington''''' is a [[Television in Canada|Canadian]] television [[sitcom]] which aired on [[CBC Television]] from 1975 to 1980.

==Synopsis==
[[Al Waxman]] starred as Larry King, a convenience store owner in [[Toronto]]'s [[Kensington Market]] who was known for helping friends and neighbours solve problems. His multicultural group of friends consisted of Nestor Best ([[Ardon Bess]]), Max (John J. Dee), and Tony "Duke" Zarro (Bob Vinci), who hung around regularly to the perennial disapproval of King's mother Gladys (Helene Winston).

For the first three seasons, [[Fiona Reid]] played his wife Cathy. At the end of the third season, Reid decided to leave the series, so Larry and Cathy divorced. Larry then pursued other relationships, most notably with Gwen Twining ([[Jayne Eastwood]]) in the final season.

==Production==
The show was created by [[Perry Rosemond]], who also produced the first season. Other producers included [[Jack Humphrey (producer)|Jack Humphrey]] (1976–1980) and Joe Partington (1978–1980). The series featured many Canadian actors as guest stars, including [[Mike Myers]], [[John Candy]], [[Eugene Levy]], [[Dave Thomas (actor)|Dave Thomas]], [[Jeff Wincott]] and [[Mark Humphrey (actor)|Mark Humphrey]]. The show was popular with viewers; prior to the start of the fourth season, one of the producers noted the show drew 1.5 to 1.8 million viewers weekly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Ajc0AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=NfUIAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1052,1749516&amp;dq=fiona-reid&amp;hl=en |title=King to be bachelor|work= Ottawa Citizen |date=1978-01-25|accessdate=9 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The show's gentle but politically conscious humour is seen by some critics as a Canadian version of the topical [[Norman Lear]] sitcoms of the 1970s, such as ''[[All in the Family]]'' and ''[[Maude (TV series)|Maude]]''. The series was [[television syndication|syndicated]] to some [[United States|American]] stations during the height of its popularity, including [[WTTG]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]

After ''King of Kensington'' ended in 1980, many of the producers went on to create the new CBC sitcom ''[[Hangin' In]]'', while head writer [[Louis Del Grande]] went on to create and star in ''[[Seeing Things (TV series)|Seeing Things]]'', and Waxman was cast in the [[United States|American]] series ''[[Cagney &amp; Lacey]]''.

==Tributes==
In the ''[[Second City Television|SCTV]]'' episode "CCCP1-Russian television", one of the fake TV programs infiltrating the network is ''Hey Giorgiy'', about "everyone's favorite Cossack", intended as a Russian knockoff of ''King of Kensington''.

In the first episode of the 1990s television series ''[[Twitch City]]'', also set in Kensington, the character Nathan (played by [[Daniel MacIvor]]) was sent to prison for killing a homeless man with a can of cat food. The producers of ''Twitch City'' cast Al Waxman in the role of the murder victim, as a symbolic wink to ''King of Kensington'', although they claimed that they did not intend for the character to be seen as Larry King himself.&lt;ref name=weird&gt;"Twitch City a weird look at television addiction; Former King of Kensington gets whacked tonight". ''[[Edmonton Journal]]'', January 19, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1990s, ''[[This Hour Has 22 Minutes]]'' featured a sketch detailing the making of a film version of ''King of Kensington.''  In the sketch, director [[Atom Egoyan]] (played by [[Greg Thomey]]), re-imagines the series as a surreal crime thriller, with Larry King as a serial killer instead of a convenience store owner.  

Following Waxman's death on January 18, 2001, a memorial to him was erected in Kensington Market.

In one episode of the Canadian comedy program ''[[Puppets Who Kill]]'', the character Bill steals Al Waxman's preserved brain from CBC headquarters.

==DVD release==
On November 13, 2007, Morningstar Entertainment released ''King of Kensington – Season One'' on [[DVD]] in Region 1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/King-Kensington-Season-1/8344 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-05-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121019092321/http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/King-Kensington-Season-1/8344 |archivedate=2012-10-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This list includes those who have acted as '''presenters of the [[Eurovision Song Contest]]''', since the competitions inception in 1956. From 1988, it has been the norm to have two presenters for the contest. All contests before 1978 have had one presenter, and only a few after 1988 have had only one presenter (these being in 1993, 1995 and 2013). The 1999 contest was the first to consist of three presenters in one contest.

'''Michel Glotz''' (1 February 1931 – 15 February 2010) was a French classical music [[record producer]] and [[impresario]]. 

== Life ==
Glotz was a student of [[Marguerite Long]] and accomplice of [[Francis Poulenc]] with whom he had a long correspondence. [[Artistic director]] of several record companies ([[EMI Group|EMI]], [[Deutsche Grammophon]], [[RCA Victor]], [[Philips]], [[Sony]]), he had more than a thousand discs recorded, including a hundred operas. In this capacity, he obtained several [[Grammy Awards]] in Hollywood including [[Beethoven]]'s nine symphonies by [[Herbert von Karajan]] with the [[Berlin Philharmonic]] in 1978, or the "most beautiful opera of the year" award for Bizet's ''[[Carmen]]'' in 1984. In 1966, he and his collaborator Thérèse Darras founded a concert agency called Musicaglotz. He then turned his attention to the careers of legendary artists such as [[Maria Callas]], [[Herbert von Karajan]], [[Alain Lombard]], [[Alexis Weissenberg]]. Glotz received the insignia of [[Ordre des Arts et des Lettres|officier des Arts et Lettres]], and [[chevalier de la Légion d'honneur]] en 2007.

He died of a heart attack in 2010 at age 79.

KONI is responsible on sport development as well as organising sporting events within Indonesian national boundary on national level. Its biggest event is the [[Pekan Olahraga Nasional]] (PON), [[multi-sport event]] held every four years where Indonesian athletes compete. It is the largest sporting event in Indonesia.

In 2005, KOI (''Komite Olimpiade Indonesia'' or [[Indonesian Olympic Committee]]) was formed as a separate entity from KONI. KOI is responsible as Indonesian [[National Olympic Committee]], to organise Indonesian participation in international sporting events, such as [[Olympic Games]], [[Asian Games]], [[Southeast Asian Games]], etc. The KONI-KOI separation was based according to ''Undang-Undang Nomor 3 Tahun 2005'' about National Sport System, and further enforced with ''Peraturan Pemerintah Nomor 17 Tahun 2007'' about the organizing of sporting events.&lt;ref name="KOIHis"&gt;{{cite web | title=Sejarah KOI | url=http://www.nocindonesia.or.id/about-us/history.html# | publisher=Komite Olimpiade Indonesia | accessdate=May 17, 2014 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20140110171825/http://www.nocindonesia.or.id/about-us/history.html | archivedate=January 10, 2014 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18090">The '''National Toy Hall of Fame''' is an American [[Hall of Fame|hall of fame]] that recognizes the contributions of [[toy]]s and [[game]]s that have sustained their popularity for many years. Criteria for induction include: icon status (the toy is widely recognized, respected, and remembered); longevity (more than a passing fad); discovery (fosters learning, creativity, or discovery); and innovation (profoundly changed play or toy design).&lt;ref name="Hall of Famers: Easy-Bake, Lionel"&gt;{{cite web|author=staff |title=Hall of Famers: Easy-Bake, Lionel |publisher=[[Playthings (magazine)|Playthings]] |date=2006-11-09 |url=http://www.playthings.com/article/CA6389758.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20070619201252/http://www.playthings.com/article/CA6389758.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2007-06-19 |accessdate=2008-02-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Established in 1998 under the direction of Ed Sobey, it was originally housed at [[A.

"'''Nothing Human'''" is the 102nd episode of ''[[Star Trek: Voyager]]'', the eighth episode of the [[Star Trek: Voyager (season 5)|fifth season]]. This was the final episode to be written by series co-creator [[Jeri Taylor]].

==Plot==
''Voyager'' encounters an energy wave that turns out to be a distress call from a nearby ship. Arriving to help, they find the ship contains only one non-humanoid life form on the verge of dying. They transport the scorpion-like creature to Sickbay, and [[The Doctor (Star Trek)|The Doctor]] begins to try to treat it. [[B'Elanna Torres]], having learned of how the creature interacts with its ship, arrives to provide advice, but suddenly the creature leaps at her. It wraps itself around her, piercing her neck and other vital organs, creating a physical and biochemical bond between them. The Doctor finds that attempting to pull the creature off will likely kill Torres, and seeks another solution. When he exhausts his own knowledge, he searches through the ''Voyager'' databanks and discovers information on the brilliant [[Cardassian]] [[Astrobiology|exobiologist]] Crell Moset. The Doctor programs the holodeck to recreate Moset as to work out the solution for separating the creature from Torres together, and they develop a rapport with each other. Moset finds a method that they could separate the creature, likely killing it while leaving Torres alive, but the Doctor would rather save both patients.

Word of the Doctor's simulation spreads about the ship. Tabor, a [[Bajoran]] ensign, accosts the Doctor, telling him that the real Moset had indiscriminately experimented on hundreds of Bajoran lives during the [[Cardassian Occupation|Cardassian occupation of Bajor]], even though these ended up with beneficial treatments, and threatens to resign if Moset's program is allowed to continue. Torres, barely alive, also learns of Moset, and as a former Maquis member that was sympathetic to Bajor's cause, refuses to accept any procedure developed by the simulation. Moset does come across a procedure that should safely separate the creature from Torres without harming either, and after much deliberation with the senior staff, [[Kathryn Janeway|Captain Janeway]] orders the Doctor to proceed, overriding Torres' refusal.

The Doctor and Moset start the operation in the holodeck, which involves applying a high frequency pulse to the creature's primary neo-cortex to weaken its motor controls. Initially this appears to work but as the operation continues, the effect of the pulse weakens, and Moset insists on increasing the frequency to make it more potent but potentially damaging the creature's synapses, but the Doctor orders him to stop, and instead applies the pulse to the secondary neo-cortex.

During the operation, a ship similar in design to the creature arrives, and it attempts to communicate with ''Voyager'', but this only comes out as a series of high-pitched shrieks. ''Voyager'' is unable to provide a comprehensible reply, and the new ship grabs ''Voyager'' in a power-draining [[tractor beam]]. Though her senior staff suggest using weapons to disable the new ship, Janeway holds firm onto arriving at a peaceful solution. First Officer [[Chakotay]] reroutes power to the holodeck to assure the Doctor can complete the operation with Moset. Eventually, the Doctor's treatment works, and they are able to stabilize both Torres and the creature. Janeway has the creature transported back aboard the new ship. It disengages the tractor beam and flies off.

Janeway poses the question to the Doctor of whether they should retain the Moset program, as though his xenobiology knowledge would be of tremendous help, his presence has upset part of the crew; Torres herself is furious at Janeway for overriding her refusal even though it saved her life. The Doctor talks to Moset privately, and comes to learn Moset considers his [[Machiavellian]] methods necessary for ''Voyager''{{'}}s survival, and that itself requires them to experiment on "lower" animals for the greater good. The Doctor wavers, and Moset tries to plead with him, pointing out that  the Doctor himself has not lived up to the [[Hippocratic Oath]] by utilizing all available resources to save a life. The Doctor is not moved by Moset's argument and orders the program terminated and deleted from the computer, explaining he cannot in good conscience use Moset's knowledge knowing how it was obtained.

An '''Organist and Master of the Choristers''' is a title given to a [[Director of Music]] at a [[cathedral]], particularly a [[Church of England]] cathedral. The tradition dates back to the Middle Ages. They are often both the [[organist]] and the [[choirmaster]].

As Organist and Master of the Choristers, they are primarily occupied with the training and conducting of the cathedral choir. The sub-organist or assistant organist usually plays at cathedral services, although they will also be expected to take over the choral duties if the organist is unavailable.

One of the longest serving Organist and Master of the Choristers was Andrew Goodwin, who retired from [[Bangor Cathedral]] on 31 October 2009. He had served there for 37 years. He was the master of the choristers when [[Aled Jones]] was in the choir.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} Other long-serving holders of the title include Charles J Brennan who spent 60 years (1904-1964) at [[St Anne's Cathedral, Belfast|Belfast Cathedral]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newulsterbiography.co.uk/index.php/home/viewPerson/1820&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Pah Wongso Pendekar Boediman''''' (Malay for ''Pah Wongso the Righteous Warrior'') is a 1941 [[detective film]] from the [[Dutch East Indies]] (now Indonesia). The first production by [[Star Film (Dutch East Indies company)|Star Film]], it was produced by Jo Eng Sek and featured camerawork by Cho' Chin Hsin. Starring [[L. V. Wijnhamer, Jr.]], [[Elly Joenara]], and Mohamad Arief, it followed the social worker Pah Wongso as he investigated a murder to clear his protégé's name.

The first film of its genre to be produced in the Indies, ''Pah Wongso Pendekar Boediman'' was made to capitalize on the popularity of Wijnhamer and [[Hollywood]] characters such as [[Charlie Chan]] and [[Mr. Moto]]. Released in April 1941 to popular acclaim, it had a mixed critical reception; the reviewer [[Saeroen]] suggested that its success was entirely because of its star's renown. A sequel to this film, which is possibly [[lost film|lost]], ''[[Pah Wongso Tersangka]]'', was released later that year.

==Plot==
Pah Wongso is a nut seller, social worker, and schoolmaster who lives in [[Batavia, Dutch East Indies|Batavia]] and takes care of the local poor. One day, his young protégé Wisnoe saves the life of a young woman named Siti when she is almost hit by a carriage&lt;!--"sado" in the source; a two-wheeled carriage--&gt;. In thanks, her father [[Hajji|Haji]] Abdullah gives Wisnoe a job at his rice mill. Wisnoe's zeal and diligence quickly make him stand out from his fellow employees, and he begins to woo Siti, who returns his affections.

However, Wisnoe's cousin Bardja is envious of his newfound success. A gambler who frequents prostitutes, Bardja is smitten with Siti, who does not love him. Hoping to eliminate his competition, Bardja hires some thugs to kill Wisnoe; this attempt fails, and Bardja's financial situation becomes increasingly desperate. He decides to steal from his rich uncle, but is caught in the act. In the ensuing struggle, he kills the older man, then [[Frameup|frames]] Wisnoe for the murder.

Wisnoe is arrested, and soon Pah Wongso&amp;nbsp;– warned by Siti of Bardja's previous treachery&amp;nbsp;– begins to investigate the case. Ultimately he discovers that Bardja is the true murderer and confronts him, resulting in a battle to the death. Wongso emerges victorious, and Wisnoe's name is cleared.{{Efn|Plot summary derived from {{harvnb|Soerabaijasch Handelsblad 1941, Sampoerna}}.}}

==Production==
[[File:Pah Wongso Pendekar Budiman P&amp;K Apr 1953 p17 2.jpg|thumb|[[Pah Wongso]] teaching, in a scene from the film]]
''Pah Wongso Pendekar Boediman'' was produced by Jo Eng Sek, a businessman who had produced the film ''[[Si Tjonat]]'' in 1929. Cinematography on this black-and-white film was handled by Cho' Chin Hsin, who had recently immigrated from [[Shanghai]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Biran|2009|p=233}}; {{harvnb|Filmindonesia.or.id, Pah Wongso Pendekar}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was the first production of [[Star Film (Dutch East Indies company)|Star Film]], a studio which Jo and Cho' had established in Prinsenland, Batavia (now Mangga Besar, Jakarta).{{Sfn|Biran|2009|p=233}}

At the time, the [[Hollywood]] characters [[Charlie Chan]] and [[Mr. Moto]] were popular in the Indies, as were imported [[detective film]]s in general; however, no films in that genre had yet been produced domestically.{{Sfn|K. H.|Budiarto|2006|p=193}} This led Jo to make a detective film which he thought would be successful with [[Chinese Indonesians|ethnic Chinese]] audiences.{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=246}} For this, he approached [[Pah Wongso|L.&amp;nbsp;V. Wijnhamer, Jr.]], an [[Indo people|Indo]] man who was popular within the ethnic Chinese community for his social work; Wijnhamer, better known as Pah Wongso, helped educate abandoned children, ran an employment office, and raised funds for [[Red Cross]] aid in [[Second Sino-Japanese War|war-torn China]]. Wijnhamer accepted the role.{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=246}}

To support Wongso, stage actress [[Elly Joenara]] was cast as Siti, making her film debut, while Mohamad Arief appeared as Wisnu.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Biran|2009|p=246}}; {{harvnb|Filmindonesia.or.id, Pah Wongso Pendekar}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other cast members included Djoenaedi, R. Sukran, and Miss Satijem.{{sfn|Soerabaijasch Handelsblad 1941, Sampoerna}} To ensure that fight scenes went smoothly, Jo hired members of Primo Oesman's ''[[silat]]'' and boxing group to perform as criminals;{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=246}} Oesman, a professional boxer, also appeared in the film.{{sfn|Soerabaijasch Handelsblad 1941, Sampoerna}}

==Release and reception==
''Pah Wongso Pendekar Boediman'' was rated for audiences over the age of 17.{{sfn|Soerabaijasch Handelsblad 1941, (untitled)}} It premiered at the Rex Theatre in Batavia on 1 April 1941, following a short speech by Wijnhamer.{{sfn|Bataviaasch nieuwsblad 1941, Pah Wongso}} It had reached [[Surabaya]] by June, where it was advertised as a film of intrigue, life, and death.{{sfn|Soerabaijasch Handelsblad 1941, (untitled)}} Although intended predominantly for domestic consumption,{{sfn|Bataviaasch nieuwsblad 1941, Pah Wongso}} it was also screened in China, Singapore and [[British Malaya]].{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=247}} When the film reached Singapore in July 1941, it was touted as a "thrilling Malay detective story&amp;nbsp;... full of thrills and excitement from beginning to end".{{sfn|Barnard|2010|p=65}}

The Indonesian film historian [[Misbach Yusa Biran]] records ''Pah Wongso Pendekar Boediman'' as a commercial success.{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=247}} Critical reviews, however, were mixed. An anonymous reviewer in the ''[[Bataviaasch Nieuwsblad]]'' praised the quality of the film, particularly its cinematography, acting, and story.{{sfn|Bataviaasch nieuwsblad 1941, Pah Wongso}} In the Malayan magazine ''Film Melayu'', a reviewer considered the film of similar quality to Hollywood productions and praised its casting of a South East Asian as the titular detective.{{efn|This despite Wijnhamer's Eurasian descent {{harv|Barnard|2010|p=65}}.}}{{sfn|Barnard|2010|p=65}} The critic and filmwriter [[Saeroen]] expressed concern that the film's success was not because of its quality, and opined that it was only popular because of Wijnhamer's fame.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Biran|2009|p=247}}; {{harvnb|Filmindonesia.or.id, Pah Wongso Tersangka}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
[[File:Pah Wongso Tersangka P&amp;K Apr 1953 p17 2.jpg|thumb|Pah Wongso (left) with [[S Waldy]] and M Sarip in the sequel ''[[Pah Wongso Tersangka]]'']]
By September 1941,{{sfn|Pertjatoeran Doenia dan Film 1941, Warta dari Studio|p=27}} Jo had begun production of a second&amp;nbsp;– and final&amp;nbsp;– film starring Wongso, titled ''[[Pah Wongso Tersangka]]'' (''Pah Wongso Becomes a Suspect''). Directed by Wu Tsun, this late 1941 release featured Pah Wongso in four roles and showed him attempting to clear his name after being framed for a crime.{{sfn|Soerabaijasch Handelsblad 1942, (untitled)}} Arief, Primo, and Sukran were also recast in this film, which was billed as the colony's first [[comedy film]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|S.|1941|pp=14–15}}; {{harvnb|Soerabaijasch Handelsblad 1942, (untitled)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Joenara did not return for ''Pah Wongso Tersangka'', she acted in three further films for Star; her acting career continued into the 1950s, and she became a producer in the early 1970s.{{sfn|Biran|1979|p=159}}

''Pah Wongso Pendekar Boediman'' may be [[lost film|lost]]. Movies in the Indies were recorded on highly flammable [[nitrate film]], and after a fire destroyed much of [[Produksi Film Negara]]'s warehouse in 1952, old films shot on nitrate were deliberately destroyed.{{sfn|Biran|2012|p=291}} Thus, the American visual anthropologist [[Karl G. Heider]] wrote that all Indonesian films from before 1950 are lost.{{sfn|Heider|1991|p=14}} However, JB Kristanto's ''Katalog Film Indonesia'' (''Indonesian Film Catalogue'') records several as having survived at [[Sinematek Indonesia]]'s archives, and Biran writes that several Japanese propaganda films have survived at the [[Netherlands Government Information Service]].{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=351}}

A '''pet psychic''' is a person who claims to communicate by [[psychic]] means with animals, either living or dead. The term psychic refers to the claimed ability to [[perception|perceive]] information unavailable to the [[senses|normal senses]] by what is claimed to be [[extrasensory perception]]. It is the opinion of [[Skeptical movement|scientific skeptics]] that people believe in such abilities due to [[cognitive biases]] and the use of various techniques by the practitioners, including [[fraud|intentional deception]].&lt;ref name="gracely"&gt;Gracely, EJ. (1998) [http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/extraproof.html Why Extraordinary Claims Demand Extraordinary Proof] Quackwatch.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;New York Daily News. (2007) [http://www.nydailynews.com/news/told-boy-dead-crystal-ball-fails-psychic-mo-kidnap-article-1.263146 She Told Them Boy Was Dead. Crystal Ball Fails Psychic in MO. Kidnap]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alcock, James. (2003). ''Give the Null Hypothesis a Chance: Reasons to Remain Doubtful about the Existence of Psi''. ''[[Journal of Consciousness Studies]]'' 10: 29–50.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Claims==
Pet psychics rely on different techniques when doing an animal "reading". These psychics allegedly communicate with animals and connect with an animal's [[spirit]]. Some claim that the readings are done by communicating with their [[electromagnetic energy]], similar to [[reiki]] and/or [[therapeutic touch]] healing.&lt;ref name="carroll"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Skeptic's Dictionary: A Collection of Strange Beliefs, Amusing Deceptions, and Dangerous Delusions |last=Carroll |first=R |authorlink=Robert Todd Carroll |year=2011 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |isbn=978-0-471-27242-7 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6FPqDFx40vYC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others claim the animal does not need to be alive or physically close to the psychic, as phone readings are sometimes done.&lt;ref name="adamson"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Complete Idiot's Guide to Pet Psychic Communication |last=McGillivray |first=D |authorlink= |author2=E Adamson |year= 2004 |publisher=Alpha Books |isbn=978-1-59257-214-4 |page= Back cover |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ISnH9lrVYhYC }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="orey"&gt;{{cite book |title=202 Pets' Peeves: Cats and Dogs Speak Out on Pesky Human Behavior |last=Orey |first=C |year=2003 |publisher=Citadel |isbn=0806524421}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early twentieth century, the [[Association for Research and Enlightenment]] began researching [[paranormal]] and psychic abilities in humans.&lt;ref name="orey"/&gt; The first animal communicators claimed they could communicate telepathically with animals living or dead.&lt;ref name="orey"/&gt;&lt;ref name="carroll"/&gt;

==Distinction from "pet whisperers"==
A pet psychic is different from "pet whisperers", such as [[Cesar Millan]] or [[Monty Roberts]], who use body language and a claimed understanding of animal psychology to "communicate" with animals.

==Scientific analysis==
Skeptical investigator [[Joe Nickell]] reported on this topic in the [[Skeptical Inquirer]] in 2002. He reported that [[cold reading]] can explain why so many pet psychics appear to communicate with animals. Pet psychics like Gerri Leigh and [[Animal Planet]]'s [[Sonya Fitzpatrick]] work in front of audiences with the pets and owners present at the same time. Although appearing to be impressive, the conclusions and pronouncements are "validated" by the pet owners and not the pets themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nickell|first1=Joe|authorlink1=Joe Nickell|title=Psychic Pets and Pet Psychics|url=https://www.csicop.org/si/show/psychic_pets_and_pet_psychics|website=Csicop.org|publisher=CFI|accessdate=11 April 2018|archiveurl=https://archive.is/mW4iL|archivedate=11 April 2018|date=November 2002|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, linguistic professor [[Karen Stollznow]] tested a pet psychic with a cat named Jed. Not only was the psychic "completely inaccurate in her reading of Jed's age, place of birth, background, behavior, health, and my health ...", she was unable to tell that Jed was not her cat. Stollznow concluded that "language is human-species specific. We don't and can't 'know' what animals think."&lt;ref&gt;Stollznow, K. (2003) [http://www.csicop.org/sb/show/ballad_of_jed_and_the_pet_psychic The Ballad of Jed (and the Pet Psychic)].''Skeptical Inquirer''. 19.1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Skeptic [[Robert Todd Carroll]] has described the claims of pet psychics as [[quackery]]. According to Carroll "the king of the animal quackers has to be [[Rupert Sheldrake]], who thinks he's proved that some pets are psychic."&lt;ref name="carroll"/&gt;

Skeptical investigator [[Benjamin Radford]] wrote about this topic in 2012 and said:
{{Quote|text=Even though thousands of people claim to be able to communicate with animals, there hasn't been a single scientific test proving their abilities. Professional pet psychics often sell books and teach seminars about their power, but don't prove that they can actually do what they claim.&lt;ref name=Radford/&gt;}}

Radford also outlined a simple 3-step test that would provide proof of this claimed ability, but predicted that pet psychics would always fail such a test. He also reported that "The problem of pet psychics taking advantage of grieving pet owners plagues people like Dr. Wally Sife, founder of The Association for Pet Loss and Bereavement, a national nonprofit organization dedicated to providing grief counseling for people who have lost beloved animals."&lt;ref name=Radford&gt;{{cite web|last1=Radford|first1=Ben|authorlink1=Benjamin Radford|title=Are Pet Psychics Real?|url=https://www.culteducation.com/group/1104-psychics/22854-are-pet-psychics-real.html|website=culteducation.com|publisher=Cult Education Institute|accessdate=11 April 2018|archiveurl=https://archive.is/lrqWZ|archivedate=11 April 2018|date=24 April 2012|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2012, the hosts of the ''[[Oh No, Ross and Carrie!]]'' podcast investigated the efficacy of pet psychics and were unimpressed.&lt;ref&gt;Blocher, R, Poppy, C. (2012) [http://ohnopodcast.com/investigations/2012/4/1/ross-and-carrie-pet-the-psychic-the-case-of-the-transgendere.html Ross and Carrie Pet the Psychic: The Case of the Transgendered Dog].

At least three games were in production as of early 2010, "[[Hanuman]] Typing warrior", "Hanuman's Quiz Adventure" and the "Mosquito game".&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.iiit.ac.in/~harshit.dagaug08/documents/hci_2010.pdf Introducing the “$10 Computer” DESIGN CASE STUDY 1:“HANUMAN, TYPING WARRIOR” Designing Appropriate Educational Games for a $10 Computer in India] by Kishan Patel 1, Ashita Dadlani 2, Manushree Vijayvergiya 3, Aman Jain 3,  Harshit Daga 3, Jay Panda 3, Vipul Raheja 3 and Derek Lomas, 1 [[Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology]], 2 Netaji Subhas Institute of Information Technology, 3 International Institute of Information Technology Hyderabad, 4 [[Carnegie Mellon University]], USA&lt;/ref&gt; The project [[Open-source software|opened]] the [[source code]] for these three games, written in [[Assembly language|assembly]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hastac.org/blogs/derek-lomas/2010/01/24/games-playpowers-workshop-india Games from Playpower's workshop in India] by James Lomas (on January 24, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; One of them teaches players how to type, which can greatly improve their earning potential in the job market. Another is a multiple choice question game, somewhat similar to that featured in the film ''[[Slumdog Millionaire]]''. And finally, a different game was created to raise awareness of [[malaria]] (which infects 1.5 million people a year in India) by allowing players to kill mosquitoes and accumulate points toward [[antimalarial]] [[mosquito net]]s.&lt;ref name = "ppgFebruary102010"/&gt;

== History ==
The organization was founded in 2008 by [http://socialmovement.org Derek Lomas] and [http://danielrehn.com Daniel Rehn], who were students at the [[University of California, San Diego|University of California at San Diego]] at the time, and [http://jeremydouglass.com Jeremy Douglass], a [[Postdoctoral researcher|post doctoral]] [[research fellow]] at the same school at the time.&lt;ref name = "WiredMarch112009"/&gt;

In 2012 Daniel Rehn announced on his private homepage the PowerPlay project as "finished".&lt;ref&gt;[http://danielrehn.com/projekt/playpower/ Playpower Foundation (2008–2012)] on danielrehn.com "An open-source community for designing and distributing learning games to ultra-affordable computers in developing regions."&lt;/ref&gt;

After 2012 the Playpower project was transformed to "Playpower Labs, LLC" and offers now [[mobile platform]] educational games via Apple's [[Itunes store]] and Google's [[Google Play|play store]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://itunes.apple.com/US/app/id828398560?mt=8 Mathworld] on itunes.apple.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Playpower Playpower] on play.google.com&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==
PLAYPOWER won the [[John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation|MacArthur Foundation]]'s Digital Media and Learning Competition in 2009, for which it received $180,000 to help fund its activities. More than 100 volunteer programmers from around the world have signed up to help develop games.&lt;ref name = "ppgFebruary102010"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11842">In [[television]], a '''revival''' is a [[television program|television series]] that returns to produce new [[episode]]s after being off the air for a certain amount of time, particularly due to [[cancellation (television)|cancellation]].&lt;ref name="V-Wagmeister"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2015/tv/news/television-revival-series-heroes-coach-x-files-fuller-house-1201519079/|title=TV Revivals Making a Comeback: ‘Coach,’ ‘X-Files,’ ‘Fuller House’ &amp; More|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|first=Elizabeth|last=Wagmeister|date=15 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Television network|Network]] executives may decide to attempt to revive a [[television program]] when they feel that a [[Market (economics)|market]] once again exists for it. It is one of several programming strategies television networks employ to capitalize further on successful programs; among the other methods are [[Spin-off (media)|spin-offs]], [[Reboot (fiction)|reboots]], [[remakes]], [[Casting (performing arts)|cast]] reunions, and [[television film|television movies]].

Unlike spin-offs, in which a television network creates an entirely new series around an existing [[Fictional character|character]], a revival reintroduces most or many of the original program's [[Plot (narrative)|storylines]], characters, and locales. Revivals usually take place at some point after the original series ends. By contrast, [[Reboot (fiction)|reboots]] and [[remake]]s may feature many of the original characters, but are usually played by new cast members and without taking into account events or [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]] that occurred during the original series.&lt;ref&gt;http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/driving-resurgence-reboots-remakes-revivals-tv-film/story?id=47645549&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sandy Stone''' is a male character played by Australian comedian [[Barry Humphries]]. Described by [[John Betjeman]] as "this decent man from the suburbs", Stone is one of Humphries' more enduring characters.

The inspiration for Sandy came from a neighbour, a Mr Whittle, whom Humphries knew as a boy, and was portrayed in a short story, ''Sandy Stone's Big Week'', written by Humphries (under the [[pseudonym]] H. Grahame) in 1956 but not published until 1958 (in a Canberra student magazine ''Prometheus''). Humphries describes Sandy, originally called Dusty, as an "elderly, childless man" living in the suburbs of Melbourne. His vocal mannerisms came from an old codger Humphries met on [[Bondi Beach]].&lt;ref&gt;Humphries, B:"My Life as Me", page 234. Penguin Group, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Sandy's monologues was part of the recording ''A Nice Night's Entertainment'', which was particularly enjoyed by Humphries' friend, [[Peter Cook]].&lt;ref&gt;Humphries, B:"My Life as Me", Penguin Group, 2002, p. 170.&lt;/ref&gt; Humphries is still writing monologues for Sandy Stone "Australia’s most boring man". He said in 2016 that "slowly the character has deepened, so I begin to understand and appreciate him, and finally feel myself turning into him". He no longer requires makeup for the part, and plays Sandy in his own dressing gown.&lt;ref&gt; "The consummate amateur" by William Cook, ''The Oldie'' [London], September 2016 page 18 &lt;/ref&gt;   

Sandy's monologues were sometimes inspired by stories recounted to Humphries by friends or family, like the tale of Dot Swift who was handed over to the Twilight Home &lt;ref&gt;Humphries, B:"My Life as Me", page 239. Penguin Group, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; which may be the very same home, or perhaps a subsidiary of the one Dame Edna's mother resides in. Barry Humphries sometimes used the character to balance pathos with humor or satire: in one monologue having the ghost of Sandy Stone recall his four-year-old daughter who died in the 1930s and how his wife then suffered a breakdown. The Australian columnist [[Peter Craven (literary critic)|Peter Craven]] commented that Humphries in his Sandy Stone persona could "reduce an audience of young unbelieving cynics to tears with material that might have been written by James Joyce - delivered with wan, uncomprehending wonderment".&lt;ref&gt;Peter Craven, page X "The Spectator Australia 28 July 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The character is featured in the track ''Sandy Agonistes'' on Humphries' comedy recording ''Moonee Ponds Muse, Vol. 1''

The complete scripts (edited by Colin O'Brien) of all the Stone [[soliloquies]] were published in ''The Life and Death of Sandy Stone'' in 1990.

The artist [[Sidney Nolan]] painted a portrait of the character.

'''''Squeak the Mouse''''' is an Italian [[black comedy]] [[comic strip]] and later [[comic book]] created by artist [[Massimo Mattioli]]. The comic was set in a fictional [[funny animal]] setting, depicting attempts by its title character, Squeak the Mouse, to outwit a cat who is chasing him. The comic satirizes cartoon series such as ''[[Tom and Jerry]]'', taking the content to extreme levels, which includes [[Graphic violence|gory]] [[horror fiction|horror]] violence and explicit sexual content.

Two issues of a ''Squeak the Mouse'' comic book were produced in 1986 and 1992, the first written from the perspective of the cat, who murders the title character, and the second, written from the perspective of Squeak, who murders the cat. Each issue features a [[zombie]] plotline and a [[pornography|pornographic]] section depicting one of the main characters in an [[orgy]] with several funny animal women.

== Overview ==
''Squeak the Mouse'' is a parody of the cartoon series, ''[[Tom and Jerry]]''. Although the style of the drawing is typical of children comics, ''Squeak'' indulges in graphic violent, gore, splatter and pornographic scenes.&lt;ref name=jjj&gt;Domenico Marinelli, "Biblioteca storica: Squeak the Mouse", ''Sbam! Comics'', Vol. 8, April–May 2013, p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first issue of the series is written from the perspective of the cat, who is aggravated by Squeak the Mouse, and ultimately murders the title character. The cat goes to a party and unsuccessfully attempts to have sex with his girlfriend, and instead sleeps with another girl he meets at the party, Squeak the Mouse returns from the dead as a [[zombie]] and murders every one of the guests at the party, until the cat stops the mouse by murdering it with a blender. When the cat returns home, each of the party guests, revived as zombies, attempt to kill him, leading him to kill each of the undead in self-defense. The next day, the cat engages in an [[orgy]] with a number of beautiful women, but Squeak the Mouse returns once more and slaughters each of the women, leading the cat to kill Squeak once more before chasing after another mouse. The end of the issue assures readers that Squeak is really dead and will not return.

The second issue, ''Squeak the Mouse 2'', begins with a duck who revives Squeak from the pages of the first ''Squeak the Mouse'' comic book. Squeak proceeds to read his own comic, and is horrified by his own murder, and decides to track down the cat and murder him. However, when Squeak confronts the cat at a screening of ''[[The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2]]'', the cat tricks Squeak into feeling sympathy for him, which allows the cat to briefly escape before being murdered by the mouse. As Squeak boards a plane heading to a tropical island, the cat returns as a zombie and crashes the plane, killing all of the passengers except Squeak, who escapes, and swims to the nearest island, where a pair of women awaken him by performing [[oral sex]] on Squeak, leading to another orgy sequence. The cat turns up on the island and slaughters the women, and Squeak destroys the cat, leaving only its separated bones, which are found by a [[horror film]]-loving child, who brings the remains home and reassembles them. The skeleton cat slaughters the child and his family, and once again goes after Squeak, who finally gets rid of the cat for good, but decides to antagonize another cat.

== Publication history ==
The comic was first published in the underground comics magazine ''[[Frigidaire (magazine)|Frigidaire]]'' starting from 1982. The stories were later collected in an eponymous volume in 1984; initially intended to be an ended series, it had a sequel (''Squeak the Mouse 2'') published in 1992.&lt;ref name=jjj/&gt;

== Controversy ==
On August 1, 1985, New York harbor officials confiscated the comic publication on the grounds that it was pornographic, but a court later overturned that decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=M. Keith Booker|title=Encyclopedia of Comic Books and Graphic Novels|publisher=ABC-CLIO, 2010|isbn=0313357471|page=240}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DAK35"&gt;{{cite news | last = Sweeney | first = Bruce | date = August 1986 | title = Bernd Metz | work = [[Comics Interview]] | issue = 35 | pages = 38–45 | publisher = [[Fictioneer Books]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Bernd Metz of [[Catalan Communications]], the book's USA publisher, ''Squeak the Mouse'' was ruled not obscene "because it failed the third test of the law... the [[Miller test]] as it's called... in that it did not exceed the community standards."&lt;ref name="DAK35"/&gt;

== Legacy ==
The comics are considered to be an apparent inspiration for [[Matt Groening]]'s ''[[The Itchy &amp; Scratchy Show]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sergio Algozzino|title=Tutt'a un tratto.

'''Stuart Cumberland''' (1857&amp;ndash;1922) was an English [[Mentalism|mentalist]] known for his demonstrations of "thought reading".

Cumberland was famous for performing [[blindfold]]ed feats such as identifying a hidden object in a room that a person had picked out or asking someone to imagine a murder scene and then attempt to read the subject's thoughts and identify the victim and re-enact the crime. Cumberland claimed to possess no genuine psychic ability and his thought reading performances could only be demonstrated by holding the hand of his subject to read their muscular movements. He came into dispute with psychical researchers associated with the [[Society for Psychical Research]] who were searching for genuine cases of [[telepathy]]. Cumberland argued that both telepathy and communication with the dead were impossible and that the mind of man can not be read through telepathy, only by [[muscle reading]].&lt;ref&gt;Nicola Bown, Carolyn Burdett, Pamela Thurschwell. (2004). ''The Victorian Supernatural''. Cambridge University Press. pp. 87-108. {{ISBN|0-521-81015-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An opponent of [[spiritualism]], Cumberland would attribute all mediumship phenomena to muscle reading and trickery.&lt;ref&gt;Barry Wiley. (2012). ''The Thought Reader Craze: Victorian Science at the Enchanted Boundary''. McFarland. pp. 102-106. {{ISBN|978-0-7864-6470-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3988">'''Taliesin Williams''' (bardic name '''Taliesin ab Iolo''' or '''Ab Iolo'''; 9 July 1787 &amp;ndash; 16 February 1847) was a [[Welsh people|Welsh]] poet and author, and son of notable [[Literary forgery|literary forger]] [[Iolo Morganwg]].&lt;ref name="Merthyr-Tydfil.)1903"&gt;{{cite book|author=Charles Wilkins (of Merthyr-Tydfil.)|title=The history of the iron, steel, tinplate and ... other trades of Wales: with descriptive sketches of the land and the people during the great industrial era under review|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yJQ1AQAAIAAJ|accessdate=15 October 2012|year=1903|publisher=Joseph Williams}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was born in [[Cardiff]], went to school in [[Cowbridge]], and became an assistant teacher at a [[boarding school]] run by Reverend David Davies in [[Neath]]. He gradually took over leading the proceedings of regional [[Gorsedd]]au from 1814, when he was awarded the title of [[Neo-Druidism|Druid]]. He worked as a [[stonemason]] with his father in 1815.  In 1816 he opened a school in [[Merthyr Tydfil]], where he worked as a schoolmaster until the end of his life. He assisted with the publication of his father's work ''Cyfrinach Beirdd Ynys Prydain'' ("Mystery of the bards of the island of Britain") in 1829.

In 1834 he won the [[Chairing of the Bard|bardic chair]] at the [[Cardiff Eisteddfod]] with an [[awdl]] entitled ''Y Derwyddon'' (The [[Druid]]s). In 1838 he won the [[Crowning of the Bard|bardic crown]] at the [[Abergavenny Eisteddfod]] for an essay on the [[Coelbren y Beirdd]] (the alleged bardic alphabet) which was published in 1840.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Taliesin., (ab Iolo), Coelbren Y Beirdd; a Welsh Essay on the Bardic Alphabet, W. Rees, Llandovery, 1840.&lt;/ref&gt;

On his father's death he was left his father's archive of manuscripts, which he believed were all genuine. After much work compiling and editing 26 volumes,&lt;ref name="Waring1850"&gt;{{cite book|author=Elijah Waring|title=Recollections and anecdotes of Edward Williams the bard of Glamorgan; or, Iolo Morganwg|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0OIIAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA4|accessdate=15 October 2012|year=1850|publisher=Charles Gilpin|pages=4–}}&lt;/ref&gt; a selection was published in 1848 under the title of the [[Iolo Manuscripts]] by the [[Welsh Manuscripts Society]].&lt;ref name="MorganwgJones1848"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Iolo Morganwg|author2=Owen Jones|author3=Society for the Publication of Ancient Welsh Manuscripts, Abergavenny|title=Iolo manuscripts: A selection of ancient Welsh manuscripts, in prose and verse, from the collection made by the late Edward Williams, Iolo Morganwg, for the purpose of forming a continuation of the Myfyrian archaiology; and subsequently proposed as materials for a new history of Wales|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6jREAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PP1|accessdate=15 October 2012|year=1848|publisher=W. Rees; sold by Longman and co., London|pages=1–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of Taliesin's work was based on that of his father.

After his death in 1847 he was succeeded as [[Archdruid]] by Evan Davies ([[Myfyr Morganwg]]).

==Production==
In June 2014, a press conference was held at Shanghai and attended by representatives of H&amp;R Century Pictures, Beijing Enlight Media and Nanpai Investment. It was announced that a film, television series and online game would be adapted from the novel ''[[Daomu Biji]]'' by Nanpai Sanshu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinanews.com/yl/2014/06-13/6278361.shtml|title=《盗墓笔记》将拍电视剧 网友力荐原作者出演|work=People's Daily|language=zh}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, the television series would be divided into 8 seasons filmed over a period of 8 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ent.qq.com/a/20140721/065113.htm|title=李易峰出演《盗墓笔记》 卖身八年坦言很值得|work=Tencent|language=zh}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The series is directed by Cheang Pou-soi who directed the 2014 film ''[[The Monkey King (film)|The Monkey King]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinanews.com/yl/2014/06-13/6279672.shtml|title=剧版《盗墓笔记》海报曝光 场面宏大|work=China News|language=zh}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other notable production crew included [[Hong Kong Film Award]]-winners Angie Lam and Bill Lui.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ent.sina.com.cn/v/m/2014-12-02/doc-iawzunex4881364.shtml|title=《盗墓笔记》杀青 铁三角合影片场搞怪|work=Sina|language=zh}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chun Hung Mak, who worked on the ''[[Chinese Paladin]]'' series, composed the soundtrack of the series. 

[[Principal photography]] commenced in August 2014 and wrapped up on 30 November 2014 at [[Yamdrok Lake]], [[Tibet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ctibet.cn/culture/detail/CUL429863672864.html|title=《盗墓笔记》日前西藏杀青 将以羊湖美景开场|work=ctibet.cn|language=zh}}&lt;/ref&gt; Location filming took place at the Beijing Farm Animal Research Center and the Dagao International Art Unit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ent.ifeng.com/a/20140822/40261575_0.shtml|title=

===Casting===
On June 24, 2014, [[Li Yifeng]] confirmed through [[Sina Weibo|Weibo]] that he would be taking on the leading role of Wu Xie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ent.sina.com.cn/v/m/2014-06-26/11004165241.shtml|title=李易峰《盗墓》演吴邪 张起灵将选85后|work=Sina|language=zh}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 31, 2014, official posters of the main cast including Li, Yang Yang, Liu Tianzuo, Ken Chang and Wei Wei were released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.sina.com.tw/article/20140831/13246768.html|title=《盜墓筆記》人物海報 五大角色整裝出發|work=Sina|language=zh}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 5, 2014, [[Tiffany Tang]] was revealed to be the female lead of the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ent.sina.com.cn/v/m/2014-11-05/10564235764.shtml|title=《盗墓笔记》再曝海报 唐嫣饰演阿宁|work=Sina|language=zh}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Deviation from novel== 
In the novel, Wu Xie is the owner of an antique store but in the series, he is an overseas returnee who studied at a German University and returned to China to return an antique to the country. The rest of the team also became "protectors of the antique" instead of a "tomb-raiding team".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.jsnol.com/a/2015/0613/6505.html|title=《盗墓笔记》首播遭吐槽 网友：确定不是护宝笔记？|work=news.jsnol.com|language=zh}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two new characters, High Master and Cheng Chengcheng were also created for the web series.

==Reception==
''The Lost Tomb'' is the most watched web drama of 2015 with over 2.8 billion views.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ent.people.com.cn/n1/2016/0204/c1012-28110580.html|title=《上网看剧成时尚 《盗墓笔记》荣登2015网剧王|publisher=People's Daily|language=zh}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite its popularity, the series was criticized for its draggy story-line and poorly done special effects. Fans of the novel also commented that the plot and characters deviated too much from the original novel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.singtao.ca/toronto/2015-06-21/entertainment1434862090d5644124.html|title=《盜墓筆記》情節顛覆 特效劣質唐嫣李易峰新劇遭差評|work=news.singtao.ca|language=zh}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://culture.people.com.cn/BIG5/n/2015/0626/c87423-27210924.html|title=人民日報刊文評《盜墓筆記》：收視率雖高吐槽不少|work=People's Daily|language=zh}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Robert Weston Smith''', known as '''Wolfman Jack''' (January 21, 1938 – July 1, 1995), was an American [[disc jockey]].&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite news|work=[[The New York Times]]|title=Wolfman Jack, Raspy Voice Of the Radio, Is Dead at 57|first=David M.|last=Herszenhorn|date=July 2, 1995|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/07/02/obituaries/wolfman-jack-raspy-voice-of-the-radio-is-dead-at-57.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Famous for his gravelly voice, he credited it for his success, saying, "It's kept meat and potatoes on the table for years for Wolfman and Wolfwoman. A couple of shots of whiskey helps it. I've got that nice raspy sound."&lt;ref name="MRM"&gt;{{cite web|author=Bob Pinheiro |url=http://www.modestoradiomuseum.org/wolfman%20death.html |title=Wolfman Jack, pioneer disc jockey dies at 57 |publisher=Modestoradiomuseum.org |date=July 1, 1995 |accessdate=August 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early career==
Smith was born in [[Brooklyn]] on January 21, 1938, the younger of two children of Anson Weston Smith, an Episcopal Sunday school teacher, writer, editor, and executive vice president of the ''[[Financial World]]'', and his wife Rosamond Small. They lived on 12th Street and 4th Avenue in the [[Park Slope, Brooklyn|Park Slope]] section. His parents divorced while he was a child. To help keep him out of trouble, his father bought him a large [[Trans-Oceanic]] radio, and Smith became an avid fan of R&amp;B music and the disc jockeys who played it, including [["Jocko" Henderson]] of Philadelphia, New York's "Dr. Jive" ([[Tommy Smalls]]), the "Moon Dog" from Cleveland, [[Alan Freed]], and Nashville's "[[John R.]]" Richbourg, who later became his mentor. After selling [[encyclopedia]]s and [[Fuller Brush Company|Fuller brushes]] door-to-door, Smith attended the National Academy of Broadcasting in [[Washington, D.C.]] After he graduated in 1960, he began working as "Daddy Jules" at [[WTJZ|WYOU]] in [[Newport News, Virginia]]. When the station format changed to "beautiful music", Smith became known as "Roger Gordon and Music in Good Taste". In 1962, he moved to country music station KCIJ/1050 in [[Shreveport, Louisiana]], as the station manager and morning disc jockey, "Big Smith with the Records". He married Lucy "Lou" Lamb in 1961, and they had two children.&lt;ref&gt;John A. Drobnicki, "Wolfman Jack (Robert Weston Smith)", in ''The Scribner Encyclopedia of American Lives'', Vol. 4 (Scribner's, 2001), p. 581.&lt;/ref&gt;

Disc jockey [[Alan Freed]] had played a role in the transformation of black [[rhythm and blues]] into [[rock and roll]] music, and originally called himself the "Moon Dog" after [[New York City]] [[Busking|street musician]] [[Moondog]]. Freed both adopted this name and used a recorded howl to give his early broadcasts a unique character. Smith's adaptation of the Moondog theme was to call himself Wolfman Jack and add his own sound effects. The character was based in part on the manner and style of [[blues]]man [[Howlin' Wolf]]. It was at KCIJ in Shreveport, Louisiana that he first began to develop his famous alter ego Wolfman Jack. According to author Philip A. Lieberman, Smith's "Wolfman" persona "derived from Smith's love of horror films and his shenanigans as a 'wolfman' with his two young nephews. The 'Jack' was added as a part of the 'hipster' lingo of the 1950s, as in 'Take a page from my book, Jack,' or the more popular, 'Hit the road, Jack.'"&lt;ref&gt;Philip A. Lieberman, ''Radio's Morning Show Personalities: Early Hour Broadcasters and Deejays from the 1920s to the 1990s'' (McFarland &amp; Company, 1996), p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1963, Smith took his act to the border when the Inter-American Radio Advertising's Ramon Bosquez hired him and sent him to the studio and transmitter site of [[XERF-AM]] at [[Ciudad Acuña]] in Mexico, a station whose high-powered [[border blaster]] signal could be picked up across much of the United States. In an interview with writer [[Tom Miller (travel writer)|Tom Miller]], Smith described the reach of the XERF signal: "We had the most powerful signal in North America. Birds dropped dead when they flew too close to the tower. A car driving from New York to L.A. would never lose the station."&lt;ref&gt;[[Tom Miller (travel writer)|Tom Miller]]. ''On the Border: Portraits of America’s Southwestern Frontier'', pp. 84–85.&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the border stations broadcast at 250,000 watts, five times the U.S. limit, meaning that their signals were picked up all over North America, and at night as far away as Europe and the Soviet Union. It was at XERF that Smith developed his signature style (with phrases like "Who's this on the Wolfman telephone?") and widespread fame. The border stations made money by renting time to Pentecostal preachers and psychics, and by taking 50 percent of the profit from anything sold by mail order. The Wolfman did pitches for dog food, weight-loss pills, weight-gain pills, rose bushes, and baby chicks. There was even a pill called Florex, which was supposed to enhance one's sex drive. "Some zing for your [[Water caltrop|ling nuts]]," the Wolfman would say.&lt;ref&gt;Wes Smith, ''The Pied Pipers of Rock 'n' Roll'' (Longstreet Press, 1989), p. 272.&lt;/ref&gt;

That sales pitch was typical of Wolfman Jack's growling, exuberant on-air style.  In the spirit of his character name, he would punctuate his banter with howls, while urging his listeners to "get naked" or "lay your hands on the radio and squeeze my knobs".  Part of the persona was his nocturnal anonymity; listeners from coast to coast had no idea how to recognize the face behind the voice that said things like "Wolfman plays the best records in the business, and then he eats 'em!"

[[XEPRS-AM|XERB]] was the original call sign for the [[border blaster]] station in [[Rosarito Beach]], Mexico, which was branded as The Mighty 1090 in [[Hollywood]], [[California]]. The station boasted "50,000 watts of Boss Soul Power". That station continues to broadcast today with the call sign XEPRS-AM. XERB also had an office in the rear of a small [[strip mall]] on Third Avenue in [[Chula Vista]], [[California]]. It was not unlike the small broadcast studio depicted in the film ''[[American Graffiti]]'' (which was filmed at [[KVTO|KRE]] in [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]]). It was located only ten minutes from the [[Tijuana]]–[[San Diego]] border crossing. It was rumored that the Wolfman actually broadcast from this location during the early-to-mid-1960s. Smith left Mexico after eight months and moved to [[Minneapolis]], [[Minnesota]], to run station KUXL. Even though Smith was managing a Minneapolis radio station, he was still broadcasting as Wolfman Jack on XERF via taped shows that he sent to the station.  Missing the excitement, however, he returned to border radio to run XERB, and opened an office on [[Sunset Boulevard]] in the [[Los Angeles]] area in January 1966. The Wolfman recorded his shows in Los Angeles and shipped his tapes across the border into Mexico, where they would then be beamed across the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;Gene Fowler and Bill Crawford, ''Border Radio'' (Limelight Editions, 1990).&lt;/ref&gt; It was during his time broadcasting on XERB that Smith met Don Kelley, who became his personal manager and business partner for more than 20 years. It was Kelley who saw the potential for Wolfman Jack to become more than a radio personality. Kelley started to work on a strategy to transform Smith from a cult figure to a mainstream entertainer in film, recordings, and television. He promoted Smith to the major media and formed enduring relationships with key journalists.

In 1971, the Mexican government decided that its overwhelmingly Roman Catholic citizens should not be subjected to proselytizing and banned the Pentecostal preachers from the radio, taking away 80 percent of XERB's revenue. Smith then moved to station [[KBLA|KDAY]] 1580 in Los Angeles, which could only pay him a fraction of his former XERB income. However, Smith capitalized on his fame by editing his old XERB tapes and selling them to radio stations everywhere, becoming one of the first rock and roll [[broadcast syndication|syndicated]] programs (as the tapes began to age, they were eventually also marketed to [[oldies]] stations). He also appeared on [[Armed Forces Radio]] from 1970 to 1986. At his peak, Wolfman Jack was heard on more than 2,000 radio stations in 53 countries.&lt;ref&gt;John A. Drobnicki, "Wolfman Jack (Robert Weston Smith)". in ''The Scribner Encyclopedia of American Lives'', Vol. 4 (Scribner's, 2001), p. 582.&lt;/ref&gt; He was heard as far off as the Wild Coast, [[Transkei]], on a station based there, Capital Radio 604.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wildcoastradio.com/?p=647 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120716045022/http://wildcoastradio.com/?p=647|deadurl=yes|title=Wolfman Jack in Africa, 1980. - BORDERBLASTING IN A BANTUSTAN|date=July 16, 2012|archivedate=July 16, 2012 |publisher= |accessdate=September 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In a deal promoted by Don Kelley, The Wolfman was paid handsomely to join [[WNBC (AM)|WNBC]] in New York in August 1973, the same month that ''American Graffiti'' premiered, and the station did a huge advertising campaign in local newspapers stating that the Wolfman would propel their ratings over those of their main competitor, [[WABC (AM)|WABC]], which had "[[Cousin Brucie]]" (Bruce Morrow). The ads proclaimed, "Cousin Brucie's Days Are Numbered", and thousands of small tombstone-shaped paperweights were distributed that said, "Cousin Brucie is going to be buried by Wolfman Jack."&lt;ref&gt;Ben Fong-Torres, ''The Hits Just Keep on Coming: The History of Top 40 Radio'' (Miller Freeman Books, 1998), p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.academia.edu/30244852/Wolfman_Hits_the_Road_Jack |author=[[Paul Levinson]] |title=Wolfman Hits the Road, Jack |work=The Village Voice |date=4 July 1976 |page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; After less than a year, WNBC hired Cousin Brucie, and Wolfman Jack went back to California to concentrate on his syndicated radio show, which was carried on KRLA-Pasadena (Los Angeles) from 1984-1987. He moved to Belvidere, North Carolina, in 1989, to be closer to his extended family.&lt;ref&gt;James F. Mills, "Wolfman Turns into Country Gentleman: N.C. Mansion Home to Rock 'n' Roll DJ", ''Charlotte Observer'' (February 27, 1994), p. 8B.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 80s, he did a brief stint at XEROK 80, another border [[blaster station]] that was leased by Dallas investors Robert Hanna, Grady Sanders, and John Ryman. Ryman then moved Smith to Scott Ginsburg-owned Y95 in Dallas, Texas.

==Film, television, and music career==
In the early days, Wolfman Jack made sporadic public appearances, usually as a [[Master of Ceremonies]] for rock bands at local Los Angeles clubs. At each appearance he looked a little different because Smith had not decided what the Wolfman should look like. Early pictures show him with a [[goatee]]; however, sometimes he combed his straight hair forward and added dark makeup to look somewhat "ethnic". Other times he had a big [[afro]] wig and large sunglasses. The ambiguity of his race contributed to the controversy of his program. It was not until he appeared in the 1969 film, ''A Session with the Committee'' (a montage of skits by the seminal comedy troupe [[The Committee (improv group)|The Committee]]), that mainstream America got a good look at Wolfman Jack.

Wolfman Jack started his recording career in Minneapolis, Minnesota while working at KUXL Radio in 1965 with George Garrett.  Garrett would help record the album "Boogie With The Wolfman" by Wolfman Jack &amp; the Wolfpack on the Bread Label. The title tracks "Wolfman Boogie Pt. 1/Wolfman Boogie Pt. 2" was released as the first single and was written by Garrett and T.Caire. Garrett was also responsible for engineering, producing and assembling the band. A second single, "New Orleans" was also released.&lt;ref&gt;Minnesota Rocked, Tom Tourville, 2nd Edition, 1983, LOCCC# 82-074566&lt;/ref&gt; 

Wolfman Jack released two albums on the [[Wooden Nickel Records|Wooden Nickel]] label: ''Wolfman Jack'' (1972) and ''Through the Ages'' (1973).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Callahan| first = Mike| last2 = Edwards| first2 = David| last3 = Eyries| first3 = Patrice| title = Wooden Nickel Album Discography| date = October 26, 2005| url = http://www.bsnpubs.com/rca/woodennickel.html| accessdate = October 3, 2009| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100113140243/http://bsnpubs.com/rca/woodennickel.html| archive-date = January 13, 2010| dead-url = yes| df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; His 1972 single "I Ain't Never Seen a White Man" hit #106 on the Billboard [[Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles|Singles Charts]].

In 1973, he appeared in director [[George Lucas]]'s second feature film, ''[[American Graffiti]]'', as himself. His broadcasts tie the film together, and [[Richard Dreyfuss]]'s character catches a glimpse of the mysterious Wolfman in a pivotal scene. In gratitude for Wolfman Jack's participation, Lucas gave him a fraction of a "point" — the division of the profits from a film — and the extreme financial success of ''American Graffiti'' provided him with a regular income for life. He also appeared in the film's 1979 sequel, ''[[More American Graffiti]]'', though only through voice-overs. In 1978, Wolfman Jack appeared as Bob "The Jackal" Smith in a made-for-TV movie ''[[Deadman's Curve]],'' a film based on the musical careers of Jan Berry and Dean Torrence, aka [[Jan and Dean]].

Subsequently, Smith appeared in several television shows as Wolfman Jack. They included ''[[The Odd Couple (1970 TV series)|The Odd Couple]]''; ''[[What's Happening!!]]''; ''[[Vega$]]''; ''[[Wonder Woman (TV series)|Wonder Woman]]''; ''[[Hollywood Squares]]''; ''[[Married... with Children]]''; ''[[Emergency!]]''; and ''[[Galactica 1980]]''. He was the regular announcer and occasional host for ''[[The Midnight Special (TV series)|The Midnight Special]]'' on [[NBC]] from 1973 to 1981. He was also the host of his self-titled variety series, ''[[The Wolfman Jack Show]]'', which was produced in [[Canada]] by [[CBC Television]] in 1976, and syndicated to stations in the US.

He promoted [[Clearasil]] and [[Pabst Brewing Company|Olympia beer]] in radio and TV commercials in the 1970s. In the 1980s he promoted the "Rebel" Honda motorcycle in television commercials.

Listening to Wolfman Jack's broadcasting influenced [[Jim Morrison]]'s lyrics for "[[The WASP (Texas Radio and the Big Beat)]]" song.  He is also mentioned in the [[Grateful Dead]] song, "Ramble On Rose":  "Just like Crazy Otto/Just like Wolfman Jack/Sittin' plush with a royal flush/Aces back to back."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://artsites.ucsc.edu/GDead/agdl/ramble2.html |title=The Annotated "Ramble On Rose" |publisher=Artsites.ucsc.edu |date= |accessdate=August 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He also furnished his voice in [[The Guess Who]]'s 1974 tribute, the [[top 40]] hit single, "[[Clap for the Wolfman]]". A few years earlier, [[Todd Rundgren]] recorded a similar tribute, "Wolfman Jack", on the album ''[[Something/Anything?]]''; the single version of the track includes a shouted talk-over intro by the Wolfman but on the album version Rundgren performs that part himself. Canadian band [[The Stampeders]] also released a cover of "[[Hit the Road Jack]]" in 1975 featuring Wolfman Jack; the storyline of the song involved a man named "Cornelius" calling Jack on the phone, telling him the story of how his girlfriend had thrown him out of the house, and trying to persuade Jack to let him come and stay with him (at this point, Jack ended the call). His voice is also featured in the song  "Did You Boogie (With Your Baby)" by [[Flash Cadillac &amp; the Continental Kids]] (Billboard HOT 100 peak #29 in October 1976) and an imitation of him is featured as a cameo in "Don't Call Us, We'll Call You" by [[Sugarloaf (band)|Sugarloaf]] (Billboard HOT 100 peak #9 in March 1975). In September 1975, Wolfman Jack appeared on stage with the Stampeders (singing "Hit the Road Jack") as a warm-up act for the Beach Boys at the Canadian National Exhibition in Toronto, Canada and that same year he also performed "Don't Call Us, We'll Call You" with Sugarloaf on ''[[The Midnight Special (TV series)|The Midnight Special]]''.  He is mentioned in [[Tammy Wynette]]'s 1978 hit "I'd Like to See Jesus on ''The Midnight Special''".

In July 1974, Wolfman Jack was the MC for the [[Ozark Music Festival]] at the [[Missouri State Fair]] grounds, a huge three-day [[rock festival]] with an estimated attendance of 350,000 people, making it one of the largest music events in history.

In 1975-80, Wolfman Jack hosted Halloween Haunt at [[Knott's Berry Farm]], which transforms itself into [[Knott's Scary Farm]] each year for Halloween. It is the most successful special event of any theme park in the country, and has often sold out.&lt;ref&gt;Merritt, Christopher, and Lynxwiler, J. Eric.

1n 1980, he portrayed himself in the 2 part episode of ''[[Galactica 1980]]'' "The Night the Cylons Landed, Part II" as a Radio station DJ coerced by Cylons to gain access to the station's Transmitter equipment.

In 1980, he took the small role of Reverend Billy in the [[Cult film|cult]] horror comedy film ''[[Motel Hell]]''. From 1980 to 1982, Wolfman Jack voiced the intro to the cartoon ''[[The Fonz and the Happy Days Gang]]'' airing Saturday mornings on ABC.

Those radio advertisements were extracted from half-hour radio programs that were distributed to radio stations across the country.

==Radio Caroline==
When the one surviving ship in what had originally been a [[pirate radio]] network of [[Radio Caroline|Radio Caroline North and Radio Caroline South]] sank in 1980, a search began to find a replacement. Because of the laws passed in the UK in 1967, it became necessary for the sales operation to be situated in the US. For a time, Don Kelley, Wolfman Jack's business partner and personal manager, acted as the West Coast agent for the planned new [[Radio Caroline]], but the deal eventually fell apart.

As a part of this process, Wolfman Jack was set to deliver the morning shows on the new station. To that end, Wolfman Jack recorded a number of programs that never aired, because the station didn't come on air according to schedule. (It eventually returned from a new ship in 1983 which remained at sea until 1990.) Today those tapes are traded among collectors of his work.

==Death==
On July 1, 1995, Smith died from a heart attack at his house in [[Belvidere, North Carolina]], shortly after finishing a weekly broadcast.&lt;ref name="MRM"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wolfmanjack.org/wolfhistory.htm |title=A short synapses about Wolfman Jack, his accomplishments, and his life |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130727105619/http://www.wolfmanjack.org/wolfhistory.htm |archive-date=July 27, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He is buried at a family cemetery in Belvidere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Wolfman Jack |website=Find A Grave |url=https://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GRid=11176976 |access-date=October 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
