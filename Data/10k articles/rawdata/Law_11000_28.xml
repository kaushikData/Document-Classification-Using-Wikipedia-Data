      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6407">{{History of Argentina}}
The '''1989 riots''' were a series of [[riot]]s and related episodes of [[looting]] in stores and supermarkets in [[Argentina]], during the last part of the [[president of Argentina|presidency]] of [[Raúl Alfonsin]], between May and June 1989. The riots were caused by the rampant [[hyperinflation]] and food [[economic shortage|shortage]], and were associated with legal [[protest]]s and [[Demonstration (people)|demonstrations]].

The first riots started in [[Rosario]], the third-largest city in the country, when people demanded supermarkets to give away food; they quickly spread to other cities, specially in [[Greater Buenos Aires]]. The national government established a [[state of emergency]]. More than 40 people were arrested, and there were 14 dead (20 according to unofficial reports). Eventually President Alfonsín resigned, and president elect [[Carlos Menem]] took office six months in advance, in July.
&lt;ref&gt;[[Human Rights Watch]]. [https://www.hrw.org/reports/1989/WR89/Argentin.htm 1989 Argentina report].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Build-up==
In August 1988 the Alfonsín government launched a new economic plan, called ''Plan Primavera'', intended to contain inflation. It included [[price controls]], negotiated with 53 leading companies, and [[exchange rate]] controls, the freezing of state workers' wages, and negotiations with the labour unions. The plan soon proved a failure. Interest rates rose uncontrollably, and the Central Bank's foreign currency reserves were depleted, as it sold U.S. dollars to preserve the value of the [[Argentine austral]]. The economic establishment withdrew deposits from the banks, withheld the dollars brought in by exports, and purposefully delayed the paying of taxes.&lt;ref&gt;Portal Planeta Sedna. [http://www.portalplanetasedna.com.ar/alfonsin.htm Resumen del Gobierno de Alfonsín]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;Todo-Argentina. [http://www.todo-argentina.net/historia/democracia/alfonsin/1988.htm Año 1988].&lt;/ref&gt;

During May 1989, the exchange rate (while fixed in theory) rose from 80 to 200 australes to the dollar. In Rosario, the inflation rate of May reached 96.5%. There was a shortage of basic products in supermarkets and stores, and their price tags were updated several times in the same day.

The results of the general elections held on 14 May 1989 were overwhelmingly favourable to the [[Justicialist Party]]. The volatile situation prompted talks about the possibility of anticipating the assumption of the president elect. In Rosario, mayor [[Horacio Usandizaga]] resigned, fulfilling a promise that he would leave office if Menem got elected.

Wednesday, 24 May was a bank holiday. The first isolated riots erupted in Rosario and [[Córdoba, Argentina|Córdoba]]. On 28 May the president announced an emergency economic plan. That night the riots and episodes of looting became generalized in Rosario, especially in the southern neighbourhoods, where most of the larger supermarkets were concentrated at the time, and the next day they spread to the nearby industrial corridor and to other cities, accompanied in certain cases by road blockades and ''[[cacerolazo]]s''.
&lt;ref name="nhsf"&gt;Gabriela Águila. Nueva Historia de Santa Fe (2006). Vol. 11, ''De los cordones industriales a la integración del eje Mercosur (1940-2005).'' Ch. 12, pp. 183.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The riots in Rosario==
The rioters broke into supermarkets, food stores and smaller businesses, in groups of varying size (as small as 20 people and as large as 1,000). In most cases they were young, and included a significant proportion of women and children, who doubled as willing [[human shield]]s against the police. Though most were motivated by hunger and took only food, many also stole cash registers, furniture, refrigerators, etc. Common robbers as well as ostensibly middle-class people could be found among the crowd, as well as people who loaded stolen merchandise on cars and other motor vehicles. The violence was directed at the businesses, not the people, although there were some isolated incidents of owners being hurt or hurting others when trying to defend their shops, and attacks on some police stations.
&lt;ref name="nhsf"/&gt;

Police action was rather passive during the first two days, which contributed to the generalization of the riots. Whether they were overwhelmed by its massive dimensions is a matter of discussion; some hypotheses point to orders from a faction of the provincial government. Some neighbours claimed that the police was merely "guarding" the robbers, as the security forces only shot some rounds into the air and few arrests were made.

This changed on 29 May, when the president declared a [[state of emergency]] for 30 days. The city was militarized and divided into three operational areas. School classes were suspended, banks were closed, public transportation was shut down, and a [[curfew]] was imposed.

By the beginning of June the riots ceased, as the situation was controlled by the security forces and the municipal and national governments began to deliver food assistance. The national government also ordered the creation of hundreds of [[soup kitchen]]s.
&lt;ref&gt;Time.com. [http://jcgi.pathfinder.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,957935,00.html The Fall and Fall of Argentina].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Riots in 1990==
The beginning of 1990 saw a new, albeit much smaller wave of riots, mainly February and March, in Rosario and Greater Buenos Aires. The economic crisis had not abated, and many businesses had resumed operating with physical barriers. The riots were contained quickly, again with delivery of food assistance to the poorer neighbourhoods.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1509">In [[insurance]], an '''adjustment clause''' in a contract specifies how the amount of a [[Claim (legal)|claim]] (particularly a claim against an insurance company) will be determined for the purposes of a settlement, giving consideration to objections made by the debtor or insurance company, as well as the allegations of the claimant in support of his claim.

For example:
*In [[fire insurance]], an adjustment clause provides that in the event of loss or damage at any location mentioned in the policy, the amount of insurance in force at that location shall be prorated to the burned and unburned portions of the property.  Also known as a ''burned and unburned clause''.&lt;ref&gt;Indiana Lumbermen's Mutual Ins. Co. v Fair (CA5 Miss) 109 F2d 607.&lt;/ref&gt;
*In [[life insurance]], an ''age adjustment clause'' specifies that if the age of the insured has been understated, the amount payable upon his death shall be that amount which the premium charged would have purchased for the insured's correct age.

Adjustment of claims is not confined to claims against insurance companies. An allowance made by a creditor, particularly a [[Retailing|storekeeper]], in response to a complaint by the debtor respecting the accuracy of the account or other claim, or a reduction in the claim or account made to induce a prompt payment, is in a proper sense an adjustment.&lt;ref&gt;29A Am J Rev ed Ins § 1604.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Andrey Lyapchev Ivan Lukov Simeon Radev.jpg|right|thumb| The Bulgarian delegates: [[Major General]] [[Ivan Lukov]], [[Andrey Lyapchev]] and [[Simeon Radev]].]]
The '''Armistice of Salonica''' (also known as the '''Armistice of Thessalonica''') was signed on 29 September 1918 between [[Bulgaria during World War I|Bulgaria]] and the [[Allies of World War I|Allied Powers]] in [[Thessaloniki]]. The convention followed after a request by the Bulgarian  government on 24 September asking for a ceasefire. The armistice effectively ended Bulgaria's participation in [[World War I]] on the side of the [[Central Powers]] and came into effect on the Bulgarian front at noon on 30 September. The armistice regulated the demobilization and disarmament of the Bulgarian armed forces.

The signatories were, for the Allies, the French General [[Louis Franchet d'Espérey]], commander of the [[Allied Army of the Orient]], and a commission appointed by the Bulgarian government, composed of General [[Ivan Lukov]] (member of the Bulgarian Army HQ), [[Andrey Lyapchev]] (cabinet member) and [[Simeon Radev]] (diplomat).

==Terms==
The terms of the [[armistice]] called for the immediate demobilization of all Bulgarian military activities. It ordered the evacuation of Bulgarian-occupied Greek and Serbian territories, placed limits and restrictions to the size of Bulgaria's military employment and required Bulgaria to return military equipment that had been taken from the Greek [[IV Army Corps (Greece)|Fourth Army Corps]] during the Bulgarian [[Struma operation|occupation of Eastern Macedonia]] in 1916. German and Austrian-Hungarian troops had to leave Bulgaria within 4 weeks. Bulgaria and especially Sofia were not to be occupied, but the Allies had the right to temporarily occupy some strategic points and to transfer troops over Bulgarian territory. 

According to article five of the Armistice, about 150 000 Bulgarian soldiers that had been situated to the west of the [[Skopje]] meridian were to be delivered to the Entente as hostages.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/16751560/Bulgarian_Prisoners_of_War_and_Prisoners_of_War_in_Bulgaria_1915-1918_Law_Practices_and_Everyday_Life._In_Mustafa_Da%C5%9F_at_al._First_World_War_Centenary._Symposium_Papers_Book._Izmir_Dokuz_Eyl%C3%BCl_University_2015_pp._443-463 Dimitrova, Snezhana.

Izmir; Dokuz Eylül University, 2015, pp. 443-463, note 14.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The French would send troops to Romania and the British and Greeks to European Turkey, at that moment still at war with the Allies.  

The document would remain in effect until a final general peace treaty (the [[Treaty of Neuilly-sur-Seine]], in November 1919) was concluded.

'''The Bill of Rights''', also known as the '''English Bill of Rights''', is an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of England]] that sets out certain basic [[civil rights]] and clarifies who would be next to inherit [[the Crown]]. It received the [[Royal Assent]] on 16 December 1689 and is a restatement in [[Statute|statutory form]] of the [[Declaration of Right, 1689|Declaration of Right]] presented by the [[Convention Parliament (1689)|Convention Parliament]] to [[William III of England|William III]] and [[Mary II of England|Mary II]] in February 1689, inviting them to become joint sovereigns of [[Kingdom of England|England]]. The Bill of Rights lays down limits on the powers of the [[monarch]] and sets out the rights of Parliament, including the requirement for regular parliaments, free elections, and [[freedom of speech]] in Parliament. It sets out certain rights of individuals including the prohibition of [[cruel and unusual punishment]] and reestablished the right of [[Protestantism|Protestants]] to [[right to bear arms|have arms for their defence]] within the [[rule of law]]. Furthermore, the Bill of Rights described and condemned several misdeeds of [[James II]] of England.&lt;ref&gt;The key landmark is the Bill of Rights (1689), which established the supremacy of Parliament over the Crown. ... The Bill of Rights (1689) then settled the primacy of Parliament over the monarch’s prerogatives, providing for the regular meeting of Parliament, free elections to the Commons, free speech in parliamentary debates, and some basic human rights, most famously freedom from ‘cruel or unusual punishment’. {{cite web |title=Britain's unwritten constitution |url=http://www.bl.uk/magna-carta/articles/britains-unwritten-constitution |publisher=British Library |accessdate=27 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These ideas reflected those of the political thinker [[John Locke]] and they quickly became popular in England.{{sfn|Schwoerer|1990|pp=531–548}} It also sets out – or, in the view of its drafters, restates – certain constitutional requirements of [[the Crown]] to seek the consent of the people, as represented in Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Maurice Adams |author2=Anne Meuwese |author3=Ernst Hirsch Ballin |title=Constitutionalism and the Rule of Law: Bridging Idealism and Realism |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-oY7DgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA97 |via=Google Books |year=2017 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United Kingdom]], the Bill of Rights is further accompanied by [[Magna Carta]], the [[Petition of Right]], the [[Habeas Corpus Act 1679]] and the [[Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949]] as some of the basic documents of the uncodified [[Constitution of the United Kingdom|British constitution]]. A separate but similar document, the [[Claim of Right Act 1689]], applies in [[Scotland]]. The Bill of Rights 1689 was one of the inspirations for the [[United States Bill of Rights]].

Along with the [[Act of Settlement 1701]], the Bill of Rights is still in effect in all [[Commonwealth realm]]s. Following the [[Perth Agreement]] in 2011, legislation amending both of them came into effect across the Commonwealth realms on 26&amp;nbsp;March 2015.

===Glorious Revolution===
{{Main|Glorious Revolution}}
Objecting to the policies of [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|King]] [[James II of England]] (James&amp;nbsp;VII of Scotland and James&amp;nbsp;II of Ireland), a group of English Parliamentarians invited the [[Dutch Republic|Dutch]] [[stadtholder]] [[William III of England|William&amp;nbsp;III]] of [[House of Orange-Nassau|Orange-Nassau]] (William of Orange) to overthrow the King. William's successful invasion with a Dutch fleet and army led to James fleeing to France. In December&amp;nbsp;1688, William took over the provisional government by appointment of the peers of the realm, as was the legal right of the latter in circumstances when the King was incapacitated, and summoned an assembly of certain members of parliament. This assembly called for an [[Convention Parliament (1689)|English Convention Parliament]] to be elected, which convened on 22&amp;nbsp;January 1689.{{sfn|Anon.|2010|pp=2–4}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bill of Rights|url=http://www.bl.uk/onlinegallery/takingliberties/staritems/510billofrights.html|publisher= British Library|accessdate=23 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Declaration of Right===
{{Main|Declaration of Right, 1689}}
[[File:Samuel Wale, The Bill of Rights Ratified at the Revolution by King William, and Queen Mary, Previous to their Coronation (1783).jpg|thumb|An 18th&amp;nbsp;century engraving, based on a drawing by [[Samuel Wale]], of the Bill of Rights being presented to [[William III of England|William&amp;nbsp;III]] and [[Mary II of England|Mary&amp;nbsp;II]]]]
The proposal to draw up a statement of rights and liberties and James's violation of them was first made on 29&amp;nbsp;January 1689 in the [[House of Commons of England|House of Commons]], with members arguing that the House "cannot answer it to the nation or Prince of Orange till we declare what are the rights invaded" and that William "cannot take it ill if we make conditions to secure ourselves for the future" in order to "do justice to those who sent us hither". On 2&amp;nbsp;February a committee specially convened reported to the Commons 23&amp;nbsp;Heads of Grievances, which the Commons approved and added some of their own. However, on 4&amp;nbsp;February the Commons decided to instruct the committee to differentiate between "such of the general heads, as are introductory of new laws, from those that are declaratory of ancient rights". On 7&amp;nbsp;February the Commons approved this revised Declaration of Right, and on 8&amp;nbsp;February instructed the committee to put into a single text the Declaration (with the heads which were "introductory of new laws" removed), the resolution of 28&amp;nbsp;January and the Lords' proposal for a revised oath of allegiance. It passed the Commons without division.{{sfn|Horwitz|1977|p=12}}

On 13&amp;nbsp;February the clerk of the House of Lords read the Declaration of Right, and the [[George Savile, 1st&amp;nbsp;Marquess of Halifax|Marquess of Halifax]], in the name of all the estates of the realm, asked William and Mary to accept the throne. William replied for his wife and himself: "We thankfully accept what you have offered us". They then went in procession to the great gate at Whitehall. The [[Garter Principal King of Arms|Garter King at Arms]] proclaimed them King and Queen of England, France, and Ireland, whereupon they adjourned to the Chapel Royal, with the [[Henry Compton (bishop)|Bishop of London]] preaching the sermon.{{sfn |Carpenter|1956|pp=145–146}} They were crowned on 11&amp;nbsp;April, swearing an oath to uphold the laws made by Parliament. The [[Coronation Oath Act 1688]]  had provided a new coronation oath, whereby the monarchs were to "solemnly promise and swear to govern the people of this kingdom of England, and the dominions thereunto belonging, according to the statutes in parliament agreed on, and the laws and customs of the same". They were also to maintain the laws of God, the true profession of the Gospel, and the Protestant Reformed faith established by law.{{sfn|Williams|1960|pp=37–39}} This replaced an oath which had deferred more to the monarch. The previous oath required the monarch to rule based on "the laws and customs ... granted by the Kings of England".&lt;ref name=refUKPBoR&gt;{{cite web|title= The Convention and Bill of Rights|url=http://www.parliament.uk/about/living-heritage/evolutionofparliament/parliamentaryauthority/revolution/overview/billofrights/|publisher=UK Parliament|accessdate=2 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Provisions of the Act==
The Declaration of Right was enacted in an Act of Parliament, the Bill of Rights 1689, which received the [[Royal Assent]] in December&amp;nbsp;1689.{{sfn|Thatcher|1907|pp=10}} The Act asserted "certain ancient rights and liberties" by declaring that:{{sfn|Williams|1960|pp=28–29}}
* the pretended power of suspending the laws and dispensing with{{refn|group="nb"|i.e. ignoring}} laws by regal authority without consent of Parliament is illegal;
* the [[Ecclesiastical Commission of 1686|commission for ecclesiastical]] causes is illegal;
* levying taxes without grant of Parliament is illegal;
* it is the right of the subjects to [[petition]] the king, and prosecutions for such petitioning are illegal;
* keeping a [[standing army]] in time of peace, unless it be with consent of Parliament, is against law;{{refn|Arguably, this right is subject to continuing [[derogation]] in modern times; see, for example, [[Armed Forces Act]] and discussion of the same in [[Military Covenant]].|group="nb"}}
* Protestants may have [[Right to keep and bear arms|arms for their defence]] suitable to their conditions and as allowed by law;
* election of members of Parliament ought to be free;
* the [[freedom of speech]] and debates or proceedings in Parliament ought not to be [[Parliamentary privilege|impeached or questioned]] in any court or place out of Parliament;
* [[excessive bail]] ought not to be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor [[cruel and unusual punishment]]s inflicted;
* jurors in trials for high treason ought to be freeholders;
* promises of fines and forfeitures before conviction are illegal and void;
* for redress of all grievances, and for the amending, strengthening and preserving of the laws, Parliaments ought to be held frequently.

The Act declared James' flight from England following the [[Glorious Revolution]] to be an [[abdication]] of the throne. It listed twelve of James's policies by which James designed to "endeavour to subvert and extirpate the protestant religion, and the laws and liberties of this kingdom".{{sfn|Williams|1960|p=26}} These were:{{sfn|Williams|1960|p=27}}
* by assuming and exercising a power of dispensing with and suspending of laws and the execution of laws without consent of Parliament;
* by prosecuting the [[Seven Bishops]]; by establishing of the court of commissioners for ecclesiastical causes;
* by levying taxes for the use of the Crown by pretence of prerogative as if the same was granted by Parliament;
* by raising and keeping a standing army within this kingdom in time of peace without consent of Parliament;
* by causing Protestants to be disarmed at the same time when papists were both armed and employed contrary to law;
* by violating the freedom of election of members to serve in Parliament;
* by prosecutions in the Court of King's Bench for matters and causes cognizable only in Parliament, and by divers other arbitrary and illegal courses;
* by employing unqualified persons on juries in trials, and jurors in trials for high treason which were not freeholders;
* by imposing excessive bail on persons committed in criminal cases against the laws made for the liberty of the subjects;
* by imposing excessive fines and illegal and cruel punishments;
* by making several grants and promises made of fines and forfeitures before any conviction or judgment against the persons upon whom the same were to be levied;
* all which are utterly and directly contrary to the known laws and statutes and freedom of this realm.

In a prelude to the Act of Settlement to come twelve years later, the Bill of Rights barred [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholics]] from the throne of England as "it hath been found by experience that it is inconsistent with the safety and welfare of this Protestant kingdom to be governed by a papist prince"; thus [[William III of England|William&amp;nbsp;III]] and [[Mary II of England|Mary&amp;nbsp;II]] were named as the successors of James II and that the throne would pass from them first to Mary's heirs, then to her sister, [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Princess Anne of Denmark]] and her heirs (and, thereafter, to any heirs of William by a later marriage).

==Date and title==
The Bill of Rights is commonly dated in legal contexts to 1688. This convention arises from the [[legal fiction]] (prior to the passage of the [[Acts of Parliament (Commencement) Act 1793]]) that an [[Act of Parliament]] came into force on the first day of the session in which it was passed. The Bill was therefore deemed to be effective from 13&amp;nbsp;February 1689 ([[Old Style and New Style dates|New Style]]), or, under the [[Old Style and New Style dates|Old Style calendar]] in use at the time, 13&amp;nbsp;February 1688. Under the [[Short Titles Act 1896]], the Bill was given the official [[short title]] of "The Bill of Rights", without a calendar year suffix.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/aep/WillandMarSess2/1/2#reference-c2144673 |title=Bill of Rights [1688] |publisher=legislation.gov.uk |at=note X1 |accessdate=14 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Augmentation and effect==
{{See also|Glorious Revolution#Legacy}}
The Bill of Rights was later supplemented by the [[Act of Settlement 1701]] (which was agreed to by the [[Parliament of Scotland]] as part of the [[Treaty of Union]]). The Act of Settlement altered the line of succession to the throne laid out in the Bill of Rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Act of Settlement|url=http://www.parliament.uk/about/living-heritage/evolutionofparliament/parliamentaryauthority/revolution/overview/actofsettlement/|publisher=UK Parliament|accessdate=8 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, both the Bill of Rights and the Claim of Right contributed a great deal to the establishment of the concept of [[parliamentary sovereignty]] and the curtailment of the powers of the monarch.&lt;ref&gt;This vigorous assertion of the rights of the subject meant that the Bill of Rights is often seen as parallel in importance with Magna Carta itself. {{cite web |title=The Bill of Rights |url=http://www.bl.uk/collection-items/the-bill-of-rights |publisher=British Library |accessdate=27 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Although the Bill of Rights attacked the abuse of prerogative power rather than prerogative power itself, it had the virtue of enshrining in statute what many regarded as ancient rights and liberties. However, some historians maintain that a more profound change in the relationship between sovereign and Parliament emerged as a result of the financial settlement that Parliament negotiated with William and Mary. {{cite web |url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/pathways/citizenship/rise_parliament/making_history_rise.htm |title=Rise of Parliament |publisher=The National Archives |accessdate=22 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The earliest, and perhaps greatest, victory for liberalism was achieved in England. The rising commercial class that had supported the Tudor monarchy in the 16th&amp;nbsp;century led the revolutionary battle in the 17th, and succeeded in establishing the supremacy of Parliament and, eventually, of the House of Commons. What emerged as the distinctive feature of modern constitutionalism was not the insistence on the idea that the king is subject to law (although this concept is an essential attribute of all constitutionalism). This notion was already well established in the Middle Ages. What was distinctive was the establishment of effective means of political control whereby the rule of law might be enforced. Modern constitutionalism was born with the political requirement that representative government depended upon the consent of citizen subjects. ... However, as can be seen through provisions in the 1689 Bill of Rights, the English Revolution was fought not just to protect the rights of property (in the narrow sense) but to establish those liberties which liberals believed essential to human dignity and moral worth. The "rights of man" enumerated in the English Bill of Rights gradually were proclaimed beyond the boundaries of England, notably in the American Declaration of Independence of 1776 and in the French Declaration of the Rights of Man in 1789. {{cite web |title=Constitutionalism: America &amp; Beyond |url=http://www.ait.org.tw/infousa/zhtw/DOCS/Demopaper/dmpaper2.html |department=Bureau of International Information Programs |publisher=U.S. Department of State |accessdate=30 October 2014 |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141024130317/http://www.ait.org.tw/infousa/zhtw/DOCS/Demopaper/dmpaper2.html |archive-date=24 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leading, ultimately, to the establishment of [[constitutional monarchy]],{{sfn|Walker|2009|p=2: "thereby establishing a constitutional monarchy"}} while also (along with the [[Penal law (Britain)|penal laws]]) settling the political and religious turmoil that had convulsed Scotland, England and Ireland in the 17th&amp;nbsp;century.

The Bill of Rights (1689) reinforced the [[Petition of Right]] (1628) and the [[Habeas Corpus Act 1679|Habeas Corpus Act]] (1679) by codifying certain rights and liberties. Described by [[William Blackstone]] as ''[[Fundamental Laws of England]]'', the rights expressed in these Acts became associated with the idea of the [[rights of Englishmen]].{{sfn|Billias|2011|p=54}} The Bill of Rights directly influenced the 1776 [[Virginia Declaration of Rights#Drafting and adoption|Virginia Declaration of Rights]],{{refn|Section Seven of the Virginia Declaration of Rights reads,
:That all power of suspending laws, or the execution of laws, by any authority, without consent of the representatives of the people, is injurious to their rights and ought not to be exercised.
which strongly echoes the first two "ancient rights and liberties" asserted in the Bill of Rights 1689:
:That the pretended power of suspending the laws or the execution of laws by regal authority without consent of Parliament is illegal;
:That the pretended power of dispensing with laws or the execution of laws by regal authority, as it hath been assumed and exercised of late, is illegal;

And the Virginia Declaration's Section Nine, 
:That excessive bail ought not to be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted.
is borrowed word for word from the Bill of Rights 1689.|group="nb"}} which in turn influenced the [[United States Declaration of Independence#Influences and legal status|Declaration of Independence]].{{sfn|Maier|1997|pp=126–28}}

Although not a comprehensive statement of civil and political liberties, the Bill of Rights stands as one of the landmark documents in the development of [[civil liberties in the United Kingdom]] and a model for later, more general, statements of rights;&lt;ref name=refUKPBoR /&gt; these include the [[United States Bill of Rights]], the French [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]], the [[United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] and the [[European Convention on Human Rights]].&lt;ref name="unesco2011"&gt;All the main principles of the Bill of Rights are still in force today, and the Bill of Rights continues to be cited in legal cases in the UK and in Commonwealth countries. It has a primary place in a wider national historical narrative of documents which established the rights of Parliament and set out universal civil liberties, starting with Magna Carta in 1215. It also has international significance, as it was a model for the US Bill of Rights 1789, and its influence can be seen in other documents which establish rights of human beings, such as the Declaration of the Rights of Man, the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights and the European Convention on Human Rights. {{cite web |title=2011 UK Memory of the World Register |url=http://www.unesco.org.uk/2011-uk-memory-of-the-world-register |publisher=United Kingdom National Commission for UNESCO |date=23 May 2011 |accessdate=4 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.history.com/news/facts-about-the-bill-of-rights-on-its-220th-anniversary |title=Facts About the Bill of Rights on Its 220th Anniversary |date=15 December 2011 |publisher=History.com |accessdate=29 September 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004215342/http://www.history.com/news/facts-about-the-bill-of-rights-on-its-220th-anniversary |archivedate=4 October 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, as with the Bill of Rights 1689, the [[US Constitution#Influences|US Constitution]] prohibits excessive bail and "[[cruel and unusual punishment]]". Similarly, "cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment" is banned under Article 5 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and Article&amp;nbsp;3 of the European Convention on Human Rights.

==Legal status==
The Bill of Rights remains in statute and continues to be cited in legal proceedings in the United Kingdom and other [[Commonwealth realm]]s, particularly Article&amp;nbsp;9 on [[Parliamentary privilege|parliamentary freedom of speech]].{{sfn|Lock|1989|pp=540–561}}&lt;ref name=Topo&gt;{{cite web |author=Toporoski, Richard |url=http://www.monarchist.ca/mc/invisibl.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19970617074036/http://www.monarchist.ca/mc/invisibl.htm |archivedate=17 June 1997 |title=''Monarchy Canada'': The Invisible Crown |date=Summer 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the [[Perth Agreement]] in 2011, legislation amending the Bill of Rights and the Act of Settlement 1701 came into effect across the Commonwealth realms on 26&amp;nbsp;March 2015 which changed the laws of succession to the British throne.&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;In Quebec the validity of the Canadian parliament's [[Succession to the Throne Act, 2013|legislation]] is under [[Judicial review in Canada|judicial review]]. {{cite news |author=Blanchfield, Mike |date=22 July 2013 |title=Quebec government to mount legal challenge to new royal succession law |newspaper=National Post |url=http://news.nationalpost.com/news/world/quebec-government-to-mount-legal-challenge-to-new-royal-succession-law}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
The Bill of Rights applies in [[England and Wales]]; it was enacted in the [[Kingdom of England]] which at the time included Wales. [[Scotland]] has its own legislation, the [[Claim of Right Act 1689]], passed before the Act of Union between England and Scotland.

Section 13 of the [[Defamation Act 1996]], was subsequently enacted to permit [[Member of Parliament|MP]]s to waive their [[parliamentary privilege]] and thus cite their own speeches if relevant to litigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Alexander Horne |author2=Oonagh Gay |title=Ending the Hamilton Affair? |url=http://ukconstitutionallaw.org/2014/05/21/alexander-horne-and-oonagh-gay-ending-the-hamilton-affair/ |publisher=UK Constitutional Law Association Blog |accessdate=19 March 2015 |date=21 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, 2016|United Kingdom European Union membership referendum]] in 2016, the Bill of Rights was quoted in a court ruling on a legal challenge seeking a judicial declaration that [[R (Miller and Dos Santos) v Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union|triggering EU exit must first be authorised by an act of Parliament]].&lt;ref&gt;This subordination of the Crown (i.e. the executive government) to law is the foundation of the rule of law in the United Kingdom. It has its roots well before the war between the Crown and Parliament in the seventeenth century but was decisively confirmed in the settlement arrived at with the Glorious Revolution in 1688 and has been recognised ever since,&lt;br&gt;Sir Edward Coke reports the considered view of himself and the senior judges of the time in The [[Case of Proclamations]] (1610) 12&amp;nbsp;Co. Rep.&amp;nbsp;74, that:&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;blockquote&gt;the King by his proclamation or other ways cannot change any part of the common law, or statute law, or the customs of the realm"
and that:&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;blockquote&gt;the King hath no prerogative, but that which the law of the land allows him."
The position was confirmed in the first two parts of Section&amp;nbsp;1 of the Bill of Rights 1688:&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;blockquote&gt;Suspending power – That the pretended power of suspending of laws or the execution of laws by regall authority without consent of Parlyament is illegall.
:Late dispensing power – That the pretended power of dispensing with laws or the execution of laws by regall authoritie as it hath beene assumed and exercised of late is illegall."

Muldoon felt that the dissolution would be immediate and he would later introduce a bill in parliament to retroactively make the abolition legal. This claim was challenged in court and the [[Chief Justice]] declared that Muldoon's actions were illegal as they had violated Article&amp;nbsp;1 of the Bill of Rights, which provides "that the pretended power of dispensing with laws or the execution of laws by regal authority ... is illegal."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The legitimacy of judicial review of executive decision-making|url=http://www.lawsociety.org.nz/publications_and_submissions/lawtalk/2010_issues/lawtalk,_issue_743/the_legitimacy_of_judicial_review_of_executive_decision-making |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100204112322/http://www.lawsociety.org.nz/publications_and_submissions/lawtalk/2010_issues/lawtalk,_issue_743/the_legitimacy_of_judicial_review_of_executive_decision-making |archivedate=4 February 2010 |publisher=New Zealand Law Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15440">The '''1993 Brazilian constitutional referendum''' was held on April 21, 1993 to determine the [[form of government]] of the country.&lt;ref name="Nun"&gt;{{pt icon}} Nunes, Branca. [http://veja.abril.com.br/blog/caca-ao-voto/tag/comerciais/ "Entre o parlamentarismo e a monarquia, o Brasil resolveu continuar presidencialista"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615195338/http://veja.abril.com.br/blog/caca-ao-voto/tag/comerciais/ |date=June 15, 2011 }}. Blog Caça ao Voto. ''[[Veja (magazine)|Veja]]''. October 15, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; After the re-democratization of Brazil, an article in the [[Constitution of Brazil|new Constitution]] determined the holding of a referendum for voters to decide if the country should have a [[Republic|republican]] or a [[Monarchy|monarchical]] form of Government, and if the system of Government should be that of a [[Presidential system|presidential]] Executive or that of [[Parliamentary system|parliamentary]] government. 

The Constitution further specified that Congress, sitting in joint session, would be empowered to effect a revision of the Constitution in 1994 by a mere absolute majority, instead of the qualified majority procedure with separate votes in both Houses of Congress that is usually required for constitutional amendments; any change in the constitutional regime of Government decided during the referendum would be adopted during the said constitutional revision.

Federal Law n° 8.624, signed into law by President [[Itamar Franco]] on February 4, 1993, regulated the holding of the referendum.&lt;ref name="Pres"&gt;{{pt icon}} [http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/leis/L8624.htm Presidency of the Republic - Law N° 8624, 4 February 1993.]&lt;/ref&gt;

An overwhelming majority of voters favoured the republican regime and the presidential system, as the country had been ruled for 104 years since the Proclamation of the Republic on November 15, 1889 &amp;ndash; apart from a brief parliamentarian experience between 1961 and 1963,&lt;ref&gt;{{pt icon}} Agência Senado. [http://www.senado.gov.br/noticias/Especiais/eleicoes2010/historia/presidencialismo-nasceu-com-a-republica-e-foi-confirmado-por-plebiscito-em-1993.aspx "Presidencialismo nasceu com a República e foi confirmado por plebiscito em 1993"]. [[Senate of Brazil|Federal Senate]]. August 13, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; which had also been defeated in a [[Brazilian constitutional referendum, 1963|referendum]]. In spite of heavy campaigning on TV and radio, [[voter turnout|turnout]] was relatively small (74.3%), considering that [[Compulsory voting|voting is compulsory]] in the country.

==Origin==
The attempted resurrection of the [[Empire of Brazil|imperial regime]] came from [[Chamber of Deputies of Brazil|federal deputy]] Antônio Henrique Bittencourt da Cunha Bueno (from [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo]]'s [[Social Democratic Party (Brazil, 1987-2003)|Social Democratic Party]]), a member of the Constituent Assembly which approved the [[Constitution of Brazil|Constitution]] which put an end to the [[Brazilian military government|military regime]].&lt;ref name="Nun"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; A [[monarchist]] since a child, and son of Antônio Sílvio Cunha Bueno, one of SDP's founders in São Paulo, he decided to propose to his fellow deputies the hold of a referendum to give the people the possibility to choose the [[form of government]] they preferred.&lt;ref name="Nun"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; His main argument was that during the reign of [[Pedro II of Brazil|Pedro II]], Brazil had experienced a period of great stability.&lt;ref name="Nun"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Surprisingly, his proposal was included in the new Constitution.&lt;ref name="Nun"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Bueno managed to convince the Constituent Assembly that, since the Republic had been proclaimed in Brazil by means of a military coup d'état in 1889, without any say of the people, the Brazilian Nation should be given the chance of deciding the form of Government of their choice. Given that, when the Constitution was approved in 1988, the country was in a process of returning to democracy after a long military regime, the idea of giving the people the opportunity to decide their form of Government (either choosing the restoration of the Monarchy or opting for the Republic, an option that would give popular legitimacy to a form of Government that had been first imposed in a military coup) gained wide support in the Constituent Assembly. Also, several members of the Assembly were in favour of a parliamentary republic (the original drafts of the Constitution provided for a parliamentary system of Government within a republic, but a vote by the Assembly altered the draft so as to preserve the presidential Executive); those members of the Assembly who favored a parliamentary model and who had been defeated in the system of Government vote then supported the proposal that led to the inclusion in the Constitution of the provision summoning the referendum. The supporters of a parliamentary republic, who desired only a referendum on the system of Government (parliamentary or presidential) voted in favour of Bueno's proposal for a question also dealing with the form of Government (monarchy or republic), because they reckoned that all monarchists would also vote for a parliamentary model in the system of government question.

On May 1992, Bueno launched the ''Parliamentary Monarchist Movement'' alongside [[Prince Pedro Gastão of Orléans-Braganza|Pedro Gastão of Orléans-Braganza]], then head of the Petrópolis branch of the [[Brazilian Imperial Family]] and one of the two claimants to the [[Line of succession to the former Brazilian throne|defunct Brazilian throne]].&lt;ref name="Nun"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; According to him, only ''[[Workers' Party (Brazil)|petistas]]'' were able to rival the monarchist militancy.&lt;ref name="Nun"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; On February 4, 1993, President [[Itamar Franco]] signed into law the bill N° 8.624, which regulated the holding of the referendum.&lt;ref name="Pres"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campaign==
According to some polling institutes, the monarchist campaign was able to obtain the support of 22% of the voters in 1992. Concerned about this, the main political parties at that time, such as [[Workers' Party (Brazil)|PT]], [[Democrats (Brazil)|PFL]], [[Brazilian Democratic Movement Party|PMDB]] and [[Brazilian Labour Party (current)|PTB]] formed the so-called ''Presidential Front'' on one side and the ''Parliamentary Front'' ([[Brazilian Social Democratic Party|PSDB]]) at the other side in order to oppose the ambitions of [[royalist]] groups. In spite of the defeat obtained by the monarchist movement, their [[slogan]] ''Vote for the king'' ({{lang-pt|Vote no rei!}}) became one of the most well known in the history of Brazilian electoral campaigns, and 13.4% of the voters supported a monarchical regime.

'''Carter's Little Liver Pills''' ('''Carter's Little Pills''' after 1959) were formulated as a [[patent medicine]] by [[Samuel J. Carter]] of [[Erie, Pennsylvania]], in 1868.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= |coauthors= |title=Henry Hoyt, 96, Dies; Headed Drug Company |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/11/07/obituaries/henry-hoyt-96-dies-headed-drug-company.html |quote=Perhaps the company's best-known product was Carter's Little Liver Pills, which had been developed in the 1870s by Dr. Samuel J. Carter, a druggist in Erie, Pa. Mr. Hoyt changed the name to Carter's Little Pills in 1959 after the Federal Trade Commission objected to advertising claims that the pills increase the flow of bile from the liver, and the United States Supreme Court refused to intervene. |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=November 7, 1990 |accessdate=2011-09-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=time&gt;{{cite news |author= |coauthors= |title=Cut Out the Liver |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,814704,00.html#ixzz1YtSDgVtq |quote=One of the most familiar of all trade names was booked for a major operation last week. The Federal Trade Commission told the manufacturers of Carter's Little Liver Pills to cut the word "liver" out of the product name. ...  |work=[[Time magazine]] |date=April 16, 1951 |accessdate=2011-09-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The active ingredient was changed when it was renamed in 1959 to be the laxative [[bisacodyl]].

==History==
Carter's [[trademark]] was a [[Cape crow|black crow]]. By 1880 the business was incorporated as [[Carter Products]].  The pills were touted to cure [[headache]], [[constipation]], [[dyspepsia]], and [[bilious]]ness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Carter's Little Liver Pills |url=http://lcdl.library.cofc.edu/lcdl/catalog/lcdl:60447 |website=Lowcountry Digital Library |accessdate=1 September 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140903102116/http://lcdl.library.cofc.edu/lcdl/catalog/lcdl%3A60447 |archivedate=3 September 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the late 19th century, they were marketed in the UK by American businessman [[John Morgan Richards]].&lt;ref&gt;.''George Fulford and Victorian Patent Medicine Men: Quack Mercenaries or Smilesian Entrepreneurs?'' (Lori Loeb, CBMH/BHCM, Volume 16: 1999, pp. 125-45)&lt;/ref&gt;

Carter's Little Liver Pills predated the other available forms of [[bisacodyl]] and was a very popular and heavily advertised [[patent medicine]] up until the 1960s, spawning a common saying (with variants) in the first half of the 20th century: "He/She has more _________ than Carter has Little Liver Pills". In 1951 the [[Federal Trade Commission]] required the company to change the name to "Carter's Little Pills", since "liver" in the name was deceptive.&lt;ref name=time/&gt;

The senator [[Robert Byrd]], after winning re-election in 2000, is quoted as saying, "West Virginia has always had four friends, God Almighty, [[Sears Roebuck]], Carter's Liver Pills and Robert C. Byrd."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=81190288 | work=National Public Radio | title=Robert Byrd, Longest-Serving U.S. Senator, Dies At 92}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Colorado water courts''' are specialized [[State court (United States)|state courts]] of the [[U.S. state]] of [[Colorado]]. There are seven water courts, one in each of Colorado's seven major [[Drainage basin|river basins]]: [[South Platte River|South Platte]], [[Arkansas River|Arkansas]], [[Rio Grande]], [[Gunnison River|Gunnison]], [[Colorado River|Colorado]], [[White River (Green River)|White]], and [[San Juan River (Colorado River)|San Juan]]. The water courts are divisions of the [[Colorado district courts|district courts]] in that basin.

Water judges are district court judges appointed by the [[Colorado Supreme Court]]. The water courts have [[Exclusive jurisdiction|exclusive]] [[subject-matter jurisdiction]] in the determination of [[water right]]s, the use and administration of [[water]], and all other water matters within the [[jurisdiction]] of the water divisions.

The water courts were established by the Water Right Determination and Administration Act of 1969, a [[state law]] which created seven water divisions based upon the drainage patterns of Colorado's rivers. Each water division is staffed with a division [[engineer]], appointed by the state engineer; a water judge, appointed by the Supreme Court; a water [[Special referee|referee]], appointed by the water judge; and a water [[Clerk of court|clerk]], assigned by the district court.

The seven water courts are:

* Water Division One - South Platte River Basin (based at the [[Weld County, Colorado|Weld County]] Courthouse in [[Greeley, Colorado|Greeley]])
* Water Division Two - Arkansas River Basin (based at the [[Pueblo County, Colorado|Pueblo County]] Judicial Building in [[Pueblo, Colorado|Pueblo]])
* Water Division Three - Rio Grande River Basin (based at the [[Alamosa County, Colorado|Alamosa County]] Courthouse in [[Alamosa, Colorado|Alamosa]]
* Water Division Four - Gunnison River Basin (based at the [[Delta County Courthouse Delta, CO; Gunnison County Courthouse Gunnison, CO; Montrose County Courthouse Montrose, CO]])
* Water Division Five - Colorado River Basin (based at the [[Garfield County, Colorado|Garfield County]] Courthouse in [[Glenwood Springs, CO]])
* Water Division Six - White River Basin (based at the [[Routt County, Colorado|Routt County]] Justice Center in [[Steamboat Springs, Colorado|Steamboat Springs]])
* Water Division Seven - San Juan River Basin (based at La Plata Combined Courts in [[Durango, Colorado|Durango]])

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4050">'''Commercial bribery''' is a form of [[bribery]] which involves corrupt dealing with the agents or employees of potential buyers to secure an advantage over business competitors.&lt;ref&gt;[[Black's Law Dictionary]] 7th. ed. 1999, p. 187&lt;/ref&gt; It is a form of [[corruption]] which does not necessarily involve government personnel or facilities.

One common type of commercial bribery is the [[Kickback (bribery)|kickback]]. For example, a seller of goods or services from "Company A" who offers the [[purchasing manager]] of "Company B" a payment to his own account to help him secure a contract for Company B's continued business is engaging in a form of commercial bribery.

Other related offenses are [[payola]] in the [[entertainment industry]], [[match fixing]] in sports, corruption of [[labor union]] officials, and [[bid rigging]] in non-governmental contracts.

==United States law==
There is no [[United States Code|federal statute]] that by its terms expressly prohibits commercial bribery, though it is mentioned as part of the definition of [[aggravated felony]] for the purposes of [[List of United States immigration laws|United States immigration law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{usc|8|1101}}(a)(43)&lt;/ref&gt; It is usually punishable as a [[felony]] under [[State law (United States)|state law]], depending on circumstances, but only 36 U.S. states have laws specifically prohibiting commercial bribery.

New York's law against commercial bribery is contained in Article 180 of the state's penal code.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://codes.lp.findlaw.com/nycode/PEN/THREE/K/180|title=NY Code - Article 180: BRIBERY NOT INVOLVING PUBLIC SERVANTS, AND RELATED OFFENSES|work=Findlaw}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of the most extensive state laws against commercial bribery in the United States, and includes prohibitions against bribing labor officials, fixing sports contests, and rent gouging.

A '''conclusive presumption''' (in [[Latin]], ''praesumptio iuris et de iure''), also known as an '''irrebuttable presumption''',  is a type of [[presumption]] used in several legal systems.

==England and Wales==
In [[English law]], a conclusive presumption is a presumption of law that cannot be [[rebuttal|rebutted]] by [[evidence (law)|evidence]] and must be taken to be the case whatever the evidence to the contrary.

For example, a child below the age of [[defense of infancy|criminal responsibility]] cannot be held legally responsible for his or her actions, and so cannot be convicted of committing a [[criminal offence]]. The age has continually been under debate with adjustments being made in line with rulings, the results of psychological research and to some extent public pressure. The age was seven at [[common law]], and raised by the [[Children and Young Persons Act 1933]] to eight (section 50) and by the Children and Young Persons Act 1963 to ten, at which it remains.

==Australia==
In Australian law, it is a conclusive presumption that no child under the age of 10 can be held responsible for criminal action.&lt;ref&gt;Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 s5 http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/cpa1987261/s5.html&lt;/ref&gt; This presumption exists to protect children by acknowledging that they do not have sufficient development to understand the gravity and consequences of committing a criminal act.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Crofts, Doli Incapax: Why Children Deserve its Protection http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/MurUEJL/2003/26.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Convention on Transit Trade of Land-locked States''' is a multilateral [[treaty]] that addresses international rules allowing for [[land-locked countries]] to transport goods to and from [[seaport]]s. The convention imposes obligations on both land-locked states and on coastal states that ratify the treaty.

The convention was concluded at the United Nations Conference on Transit Trade of Land-locked Countries, which had been established by the [[United Nations General Assembly]]. It was concluded and signed on 8 July 1965. The treaty came into force on 9 June 1967.

Coastal states that ratify the convention (known as "transit states")&lt;ref&gt;A land-locked state may also be a "transit state" if another land-locked state is transporting goods across its territory in order to reach a seaport.)&lt;/ref&gt; agree to make arrangements with land-locked states that are party to the treaty that wish to transit goods across the territory of the transit state to or from a coastal port in the transit state. The transit states agree that they will not discriminate based on place of origin or destination of the goods being transported. The land-locked states agree to be responsible for any expenses that the transit states incur in supervising or protecting the transit of the land-locked state's goods.

The convention has been noted as the first international agreement to recognise the special disadvantaged position of land-locked states.&lt;ref&gt;R. Makil, "Transit Right of Landlocked Countries: An Appraisal of International Conventions", ''Journal of World Trade Law'' '''4''':35 at 46 (1970).&lt;/ref&gt;

As of June 2014, the treaty has been ratified by 43 states, made up of an approximately even split of land-locked and coastal states. The convention has essentially been superseded by the [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea]], which contains similar provisions for transit arrangements to be made between coastal and land-locked states.

{{update|date=March 2012}}
'''Courtesy tenure''' (or '''curtesy/courtesy of England''') is the legal term denoting  the life interest which a widower (i.e. former husband) may claim in the lands of his deceased wife, under certain conditions. The tenure relates only to those lands of which his wife was in her lifetime actually [[seisin|seised]] (or [[sasine]]d in Scots law) and not therefore to an [[estate (law)|estate]] of [[inheritance]].

The customs and the meaning of the word has considerable doubt. It has been said to be a tenure peculiar to [[England]] and to [[Scotland]], hence called the courtesy of England and the courtesy of Scotland, yet this is erroneous, for it is found also in [[Germany]] and [[France]]. The ''Mirroir des Justices'' ascribes its introduction to [[Henry I of England|King Henry I]](1100–1135). The historian K.E. Digby states it to be connected with [[curia]], having reference either to the attendance of the husband as tenant of the lands at the [[lord|lord's]] [[court]], or to mean simply that the husband is acknowledged tenant by the courts of England.

The requisites necessary to create a tenancy by courtesy are:
* A legal [[marriage]] must have existed;
* The estate claimed in courtesy must have been an estate in possession of which the wife must have been actually seised; and,
* Issue must have existed born alive and during the mother's existence, though it is immaterial whether the issue subsequently live or die, or whether it is born before or after the wife's seisin.

In the case of lands held under [[gavelkind|gavelkind tenure]] the husband has a right to courtesy tenure whether there is issue born or not but the courtesy extends only to a [[Moiety title|moiety]] (i.e. half) of the wife's lands and ceases if the husband marries again. The issue must have been capable of inheriting as heir to the wife, so that if for example  a wife were seised of lands in [[Entail|tail male]] the birth of a daughter would not entitle the husband to a tenancy by courtesy.
* The title to the tenancy vests only on the death of the wife.

The [[Married Women's Property Act 1882]] has not affected the right of courtesy so far as relates to the wife's undisposed-of realty, and the [[Settled Land Acts|Settled Land Act 1884]], section 8, provides that for the purposes of the [[Settled Land Acts|Settled Land Act 1882]] the estate of a [[Tenement (law)|tenant]] by courtesy is to be deemed an estate arising under a settlement made by the wife.

The application of Courtesy (as spelled in Scots law) was abolished by Section 10 of the Succession (Scotland) Act 1964, in respect of all deaths occurring after the date of that Act. The right of Terce (being the equivalent claim by a wife on her husband's estate) was also abolished by the same provision.

== Professional life ==
David A. Wiley is originally from [[Barboursville, West Virginia]], where he received his undergraduate degree in vocal performance from [[Marshall University]] in 1997. He later earned his doctoral degree in Instructional Psychology and Technology at BYU in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://education.byu.edu/news/2008/10/31/david-wiley/ David Wiley Faculty Spotlight]&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Open content norm.svg|thumb|[[Open Content Project]] logo (1998)]]
In 1998 by Wiley initiated the ''[[Open Content Project]]'' for evangelizing [[Open content]] with the [[Open Publication License]]. In 2003 Wiley announced, the Open Content Project has been succeeded by [[Creative Commons]], where he joined as "Director of Educational Licenses".&lt;ref&gt;[http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20021128121421/http://opencontent.org/ OpenContent is officially closed.

He was also Chief Openness Officer of [[Flat World Knowledge]] in 2007, founder of the [[Open High School of Utah]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.openhighschool.org/advisory-board-2/|title=Founding Board|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was Associate Professor of [[w:Instructional technology|Instructional Technology]], and Founder and Director of the Center for Open and Sustainable Learning (COSL), at [[Utah State University]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usu.edu/ust/index.cfm?article=10367 USU-Based COSL to Host International Conference on "Open Education"]&lt;/ref&gt; He has received the [[National Science Foundation]]'s CAREER award and served as a Nonresident Fellow of the [[Stanford Center for Internet and Society|Center for Internet and Society]] at [[Stanford Law School]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/archives/000358.shtml CIS Fellowship Program, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Fast Company (magazine)|Fast Company]]'' rated Wiley #78 in a list of the top 100 creative people for 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fastcompany.com/100/2009/david-wiley 100 Most Creative People in Business: #78 David Wiley]&lt;/ref&gt; Wiley was also named a Peery Social Entrepreneurship Fellow in the BYU Marriott School of Business in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://marriottschool.byu.edu/news/?article=799|title=BYU - Marriott School - News|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Center for Open and Sustainable Learning==
 
The Center for Open and Sustainable Learning (COSL) operates on the principle that "free and open access to educational opportunity is a basic human right". Because it is getting easier to develop and distribute electronic tools around the globe, COSL sees the use of learning objects as a way to bring "open education" to all areas in an effort to fulfill "a greater ethical obligation than ever before to increase the reach of opportunity".

==Reusability and learning objects==

Wiley's early work focused on the design and development of [[learning object]]s. On one website, reusability.org, he explains that learning objects are developed to be reused as a solution to the problem of "teacher bandwidth".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reusability.org/read/#1|title=The Instructional Use of Learning Objects -- Online Version|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "teacher bandwidth" problem is defined as "the number of students we are capable of serving with our distance education offerings".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://opencontent.org/docs/soc-n-scale.html|title=Sociability and Scalability in Online Learning Environments|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writings==
From 2001 to 2004, Wiley wrote a column in the [[Association for Educational Communications and Technology]] (AECT) academic journal TechTrends entitled "Back Burner."

'''Declaration by United Nations''' was the main treaty that formalized the [[Allies of World War II]]; the declaration was signed by 47 national governments between 1942 and 1945. The original signatories on 1–2 January 1942, at the [[Arcadia Conference]] in [[Washington DC]], included the so-called "[[Grand Alliance (World War II)|Big Three]]": the [[Soviet Union]] (USSR), [[United Kingdom]] and the [[United States]] (USA). Together with [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|China(Republic of China, ROC)]], the UK, USA and USSR were sometimes known as the "[[Four Policemen]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ma|first=Xiaohua|title=The Sino-American alliance during World War II and the lifting of the Chinese exclusion acts|jstor=41279769|date=2003|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=0-415-94028-1|pages=203–204}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UN_security"&gt;{{cite book|title=Yearbook of the United Nations 1946-1947|date=1947|publisher=United Nations|location=Lake Success, NY|oclc=243471225|page=3|url=http://www.unmultimedia.org/searchers/yearbook/page.jsp?volume=1946-47&amp;page=38|accessdate=25 April 2015|chapter=The Moscow Declaration on general security}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The other original signatories (1–2 January 1942) were: the four [[Dominion|Dominions]] of the [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]] ([[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[New Zealand]] and [[South Africa]]); eight European governments-in-exile ([[Belgian government in exile|Belgium]], [[Czechoslovak government-in-exile|Czechoslovakia]], [[Greek government in exile|Greece]], [[Luxembourg government-in-exile|Luxembourg]], [[Dutch government-in-exile|Netherlands]], [[Nygaardsvold's Cabinet|Norway]], [[Polish government-in-exile|Poland]] and [[Yugoslav government-in-exile|Yugoslavia]]); nine countries in [[The Americas]] ([[Costa Rica]], [[Republic of Cuba (1902–59)|Cuba]], [[Dominican Republic]], [[El Salvador]], [[Guatemala]], [[Republic of Haiti (1859–1957)|Haiti]], [[Honduras]], [[Nicaragua]], and [[Panama]]); and one [[Dependent territory|non-independent]] government, the British-appointed [[British Raj|Government of India]].

Declaration by United Nations became the basis of the [[United Nations]] (UN),&lt;ref name="FDR"/&gt; which was formalized in the [[United Nations Charter]] signed by 50 countries on 26 June 1945.

==Drafting the Declaration==
The earliest concrete plan for a new world organization began under the aegis of the [[United States Department of State|U.S. Department of State]] in 1939.&lt;ref&gt;Townsend Hoopes and Douglas Brinkley, ''[https://books.google.com.ar/books?id=OztJcfbnpDsC FDR and the Creation of the U.N.]'' (1997) pp 1-55&lt;/ref&gt; The Declaration was drafted at the [[White House]] on December 29, 1941, by [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|President Franklin D. Roosevelt]], [[Winston Churchill|Prime Minister Winston Churchill]], and Roosevelt aide [[Harry Hopkins]]. It incorporated Soviet suggestions, but left no role for France. Roosevelt first coined the term "United Nations" to describe the [[Allies of World War II|Allied countries]]. Roosevelt suggested "United Nations" as an alternative to the name "Associated Powers". Churchill accepted it, noting that the phase was used by [[Lord Byron]] in the poem ''[[Childe Harold's Pilgrimage]]'' (Stanza 35). The term was first officially used on 1–2 January 1942, when 26 governments signed the declaration. One major change from the [[Atlantic Charter]] was the addition of a provision for religious freedom, which Stalin approved after Roosevelt insisted.&lt;ref&gt;David Roll, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=Jg7cSwH2r7MC The Hopkins Touch: Harry Hopkins and the Forging of the Alliance to Defeat Hitler]'' (2013) pp 172–175&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert E. Sherwood, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=Nh8_IgAACAAJ Roosevelt and Hopkins, An Intimate History]'' (1948) pp 447–453&lt;/ref&gt; By spring 1945 it was signed by 21 more states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Osmańczyk, Edmund Jan|title=Encyclopedia of the United Nations and International Agreements: T to Z|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6AB2CadyN7QC&amp;pg=PA2445|year=2003|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|page=2445}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The principle of "complete victory" established an early precedent for the Allied policy of obtaining the Axis' powers' "unconditional surrender". The defeat of "Hitlerism" constituted the overarching objective, and represented a common Allied perspective that the totalitarian militarist regimes ruling Germany, Italy, and Japan were indistinguishable.&lt;ref&gt;Bevans, Charles I.

Washington, D.C.: Government Printing Office, 1969, p. 697.&lt;/ref&gt; The declaration, furthermore, "upheld the Wilsonian principles of self determination", thus linking U.S. war aims in both world wars.&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas A. Bailey]] ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=KByPwUfN_D8C The Marshall Plan Summer: An Eyewitness Report on Europe and the Russians in 1947.]'' Stanford: Hoover Institution Press, 1977, p. 227.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of the war, 21 other states had acceded to the declaration, including the Philippines (a non-independent, US [[Commonwealth (U.S. insular area)|commonwealth]] at the time), France, every Latin American state except Argentina,&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Act_of_Chapultepec.aspx Act of Chapultepec]". ''The Oxford Companion to World War II'', I. C. B. Dear and M. R. D. Foot (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; and the various independent states of the Middle East and Africa. Although most of the minor Axis powers had switched sides and joined the United Nations as co-belligerents against Germany by the end of the war, they were not allowed to accede to the declaration. Occupied [[Denmark]] did not sign the declaration, but because of the vigorous resistance after 1943, and because the Danish ambassador [[Henrik Kauffmann]] had expressed the adherence to the declaration of all free Danes, Denmark was nonetheless invited among the allies in the [[United Nations Conference on International Organization|San Francisco Conference]] in March 1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=MMC9UdWeO4qQ0QHGyYG4Ag&amp;id=BXotAQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=%22Free+Danes%22+%22Declaration+by+United+Nations%22&amp;q=%22Free+Danes%22+|via=Google Books|title=The Atlantic and United Nations Charters: common law prevailing for world peace and security|first=Philippe|last=Drakidis|publisher=Centre de recherche et d'information politique et sociale|year=1995|page=131}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=98U8YSrp1YUC&amp;q=%22Free+Danes%22+%22Declaration+by+United+Nations%22&amp;dq=%22Free+Danes%22+%22Declaration+by+United+Nations%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=MMC9UdWeO4qQ0QHGyYG4Ag&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAg|via=Google Books|title=Everyone's United Nations|volume=10|page=7|author=United Nations Department of Public Information|year=1986|isbn=9789211002737}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Decree of Themistocles''' or '''Troezen Inscription''' is an [[ancient Greek]] inscription, found at [[Troezen]], discussing Greek strategy in the [[Greco-Persian Wars]], purported to have been issued by the [[Athenian assembly]] under the guidance of [[Themistocles]]. Since the publication of its contents in 1960, the authenticity of the decree has been the subject of much academic debate. The decree directly contradicts [[Herodotus]]'s account of the evacuation of [[Attica]] in 480 BC, in which it is stated that the evacuation was an emergency measure taken only after the [[Peloponnese|Peloponnesian]] army failed to advance into [[Boeotia]] to fight the Persians.  If the decree is authentic, the abandonment of Attica was part of a considered strategy aiming to draw the Persians into naval combat at [[Artemisium]] or [[Salamis Island|Salamis]].

==Discovery==
The stone bearing the Themistocles decree (Epigraphical Museum, Athens, EM 13330)&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20050518125940/http://culture.gr/2/21/214/21402m/00/lm02m013.jpg Photo from Epigraphical Museum's website] &lt;br&gt; See also [https://web.archive.org/web/20050205200700/http://culture.gr/2/21/214/21402m/e21402m.html Epigraphical Museum]&lt;/ref&gt; was discovered at some point before 1959 by Anargyros Titiris, a local farmer at [[Troezen]], in the northeastern Peloponnese.  For some time, he used the inscribed marble slab as a doorstep.  In 1959, he donated the stone to a collection of artifacts from Troezen that a local schoolteacher was displaying at a coffeehouse. There, Professor [[Michael H. Jameson|M.H. Jameson]] of the University of Pennsylvania saw the slab, and, the next year, published its contents along with a translation and commentary.&lt;ref&gt;Original publication: Jameson, M. "A Decree of Themistocles from Troizen." ''Hesperia'' 29 (1960): 198-223. See also Fine, ''The Ancient Greeks'', 305.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contents==
The inscription begins with a statement that the contents are a resolution of the [[Athenian assembly]], proposed by Themistocles.  It then lays out a plan to evacuate the women, children, and elderly of Attica to Troezen and Salamis, while the men board [[trireme]]s and prepare to defend the city, leaving only the treasurers and priestesses on the [[Acropolis of Athens|Acropolis]].  The majority of the extant text then turns to the specifics of preparing the fleet, with the text on the slab becoming illegible before the end of the decree.

==Significance==
If the account of the evacuation of Athens implied by the Themistocles decree is accurate, the Herodotean account of the events of 480 BC must be revised to reflect a Greek strategy, agreed on in June, focused on stopping the Persian advance at Salamis and the [[Isthmus of Corinth]].  If this was indeed the Greek plan, then [[Battle of Thermopylae|Thermopylae]] and [[Battle of Artemisium|Artemisium]], which Herodotus describes as all-out attempts to defeat the Persian invasion, would in fact have been only holding actions intended to give time for the evacuation of Attica and the preparation of the defenses of the isthmus.&lt;ref name="Fine, The Ancient Greeks, 308"&gt;Fine, ''The Ancient Greeks'', 308&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic controversy==
Challenging as it did the prevailing interpretation of the Herodotean account that had up to that point stood as the definitive account of the Greco-Persian Wars, the authenticity of the Themistocles decree soon became the subject of heated scholarly debate.  A study of the letter forms used suggested that the marble slab on which the decree was inscribed had been carved in the first half of the 3rd century BC, raising the question of how the text had survived for two centuries, particularly given that Athens was sacked by the Persians in 480 and again in 479 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Fine, ''The Ancient Greeks'', 306-7&lt;/ref&gt;  The first extant mention of a decree that can be identified with the one found at Troezen comes from [[Demosthenes]], who records that [[Aeschines]] read the decree aloud in 347 BC, again leaving a gap of over a century to account for.&lt;ref&gt;Fine, ''The Ancient Greeks'', 307&lt;/ref&gt;   Scholars who support the authenticity of the decree point to the last two lines of the famous oracle given to the Athenians: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;Divine Salamis, you will bring death to women's sons&lt;br&gt;
When the corn is scattered, or the harvest gathered in.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus, ''Histories'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Hdt.+7.141.0 7.141]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The identification of Salamis as the site of slaughter would seem to suggest that a strategy calling for a battle there had already been agreed upon by the Greek commanders, which would indicate that the account supported by the Themistocles decree is correct.&lt;ref name="Fine, The Ancient Greeks, 308"/&gt;  Scholars skeptical of the decree however raise a number of arguments against its authenticity. The correlation provided by the oracle's mention of Salamis has been challenged by pointing out that oracles were sometimes altered after the fact;&lt;ref name="Fine, The Ancient Greeks, 308"/&gt; various anachronisms in phrasing have been pointed out, although supporters of the text's authenticity dismiss these, noting that Greek practice was to paraphrase documents rather than copy them verbatim;&lt;ref&gt;Fine, ''The Ancient Greeks'', 309&lt;/ref&gt; finally, more serious content issues, ranging from chronologically suspect passages to statements that seem out of place in an official decree to serious conflicts with Herodotus's detailed descriptions of Greek troop dispositions.&lt;ref&gt;Fine, ''The Ancient Greeks'', 310-11&lt;/ref&gt;  In light of these objections, John Fine has argued that it is best to treat the Themistocles decree, if authentic, as an amalgamation of several decrees released at different times.&lt;ref&gt;Fine, ''The Ancient Greeks'', 311&lt;/ref&gt;

It should be emphasized that nothing in the decree explicitly contradicts the narrative of Herodotus, only modern scholarly interpretations of Herodotus, which tended to see Thermopylae and Artemision as "all-out" efforts to stop the Persian advance. The historian himself nowhere explicitly ascribes definitive dates or strategic intention to the Greeks or the Athenians.  In fact, the narrative of Herodotus at 8.40, often pointed to as a crux of inconsistency between Herodotus and the decree, tends to support the authenticity of the decree.  "The Athenians requested them to put in at Salamis so that they take their children and women out of Attica and also take counsel what they should do. They had been disappointed in their plans, so they were going to hold a council about the current state of affairs. [2] They expected to find the entire population of the Peloponnese in Boeotia awaiting the barbarian, but they found no such thing. " The Athenians, cheated of their hopes of a longer holding action at Thermopylae and Artemision and finding no resistance to the Persian advance being prepared in Boeotia, ask the other Greeks to stop at Salamis so that their families, presumably prepared to evacuate by the terms of the decree, can be conveyed to Salamis and Troezen. The decree itself is mute as to preparation of fortifications at the Isthmus and so, again, there is no explicit contradiction with the narrative of Herodotus

'''Drug liberalization''' is the process of eliminating or reducing [[Prohibition of drugs|drug prohibition]] laws. Variations of drug liberalization include: '''drug legalization''', '''drug relegalization''' and '''drug decriminalization'''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parl.gc.ca/37/1/parlbus/commbus/senate/Com-e/ille-e/03evb-E.htm Proceedings of the Special Committee on Illegal Drugs], Senate of Canada, 28 May 2001&lt;/ref&gt;  Whilst many people would argue that decriminalization will only cause an increase in usage, studies from California and Colorado, two states who implemented the policy, found that '"decriminalization" of marijuana possession had little or no impact on rates of use, and found that it was effective in reducing drug usage due to better control.' (Winter, 1989). Drug liberalization may go hand in hand with or include measures to ensure [[responsible drug use]] and some state that its challenge is not in criticizing prohibition, but in designing something better.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Caulkins|first1=Jonathan|title=Is Responsible Drug Use Possible?|url=https://www.cato-unbound.org/2008/09/10/jonathan-caulkins/responsible-drug-use-possible|publisher=Cato Unbound|accessdate=23 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Policies ==
The 1988 [[United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances]] made it mandatory for the signatory countries to "adopt such measures as may be necessary to establish as criminal offences under its domestic law" (art. 3, §&amp;nbsp;1) all the activities related to the production, sale, transport, distribution, etc. of the substances included in the most restricted lists of the 1961 [[Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs]] and 1971 [[Convention on Psychotropic Substances]]. Criminalization also applies to the "cultivation of opium poppy, coca bush or cannabis plants for the purpose of the production of narcotic drugs". The Convention distinguishes between the intent to traffic and personal consumption, stating that the latter should also be considered a criminal offence, but "subject to the constitutional principles and the basic concepts of [the state’s] legal system" (art. 3, §&amp;nbsp;2).&lt;ref name=reform&gt;[https://www.tni.org/en/paper/drug-policy-reform-practice Drug Policy Reform in Practice: Experiences with alternatives in Europe and the US], Tom Blickman &amp; Martin Jelsma, Transnational Institute, July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction]] (EMCDDA) defines decriminalization as the removal of a conduct or activity from the sphere of criminal law; depenalisation signifying merely a relaxation of the penal sanction exacted by law. Decriminalization usually applies to offences related to drug consumption and may include either the imposition of sanctions of a different kind (administrative) or the abolition of all sanctions; other (noncriminal) laws then regulate the conduct or activity that has been decriminalized. Depenalisation usually consists of personal consumption as well as small-scale trading and generally signifies the elimination or reduction of custodial penalties, while the conduct or activity still remains a criminal offence. The term legalization refers to the removal of all drug-related offences from criminal law: use, possession, cultivation, production, trading, etc.&lt;ref name=reform /&gt;&lt;ref name=emcdda&gt;[http://eldd.emcdda.europa.eu/attachements.cfm/att_10080_EN_EMCDDATP_01.pdf Illicit drug use in the EU: legislative approaches], EMCDDA thematic papers, Lisbon 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Drug liberalization proponents hold differing reasons to support liberalization, and have differing policy proposals. The two most common positions are '''drug legalization''' (or re-legalization), and '''drug decriminalization'''.

=== Drug legalization ===
Drug legalization calls for a return to the pre-20th century situation in which almost all drugs were legal. This would require ending government-enforced prohibition on the distribution or sale and personal use of specified (or all) currently banned drugs. Proposed ideas range from full legalization which would completely remove all forms of government control, to various forms of regulated legalization, where drugs would be legally available, but under a system of government control which might mean for instance:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tdpf.org.uk/blueprint%20download.htm After the War on Drugs: Blueprint for Regulation], [[Transform Drug Policy Foundation]] (12 Nov 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;
* Mandated labels with dosage and medical warnings,
* Restrictions on advertising,
* Age limitations,
* Restrictions on amount purchased at one time,
* Requirements on the form in which certain drugs would be supplied,
* Ban on sale to intoxicated persons,
* Special user licenses to purchase particular drugs.
* A possible clinical setting for the consumption of some intravenous drugs and/or supervised consumption. 
The regulated legalization system would probably have a range of restrictions for different drugs, depending on their perceived risk, so while some drugs would be sold over the counter in pharmacies or other licensed establishments, drugs with greater risks of harm might only be available for sale on licensed premises where use could be monitored and emergency medical care made available. Examples of drugs with different levels of regulated distribution in most countries include: caffeine (coffee, tea), nicotine (tobacco),&lt;ref&gt;[http://transform-drugs.blogspot.com/2010/02/regulation-saves-lives.html Tobacco regulation: Saving livings vs personal freedom], [[Transform Drug Policy Foundation]] (3 Feb 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; and ethyl alcohol (beer, wine, spirits).

Full legalization is often proposed by groups such as [[libertarians]] who object to drug laws on moral grounds, while regulated legalization is suggested by groups such as [[Law Enforcement Against Prohibition]] who object to the drug laws on the grounds that they fail to achieve their stated aims and instead greatly worsen the problems associated with use of prohibited drugs, but who acknowledge that there are harms associated with currently prohibited drugs which need to be minimized. Not all proponents of drug re-legalization necessarily share a common ethical framework, and people may adopt this viewpoint for a variety of reasons. In particular, favoring drug legalization does not imply approval of drug use.&lt;ref&gt;[http://transform-drugs.blogspot.com/2009/12/reformers-are-not-pro-drug-mr-costa.html Reformers and not 'pro-drug' Mr Costa], [[Transform Drug Policy Foundation]] (7 Dec 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessinsider.com/portugal-drug-policy-decriminalization-works-2012-7 Portugal Decriminalized All Drugs Eleven Years Ago And The Results Are Staggering], [[Business Insider]] (17 Jul 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Boaz|first1=David|title=Let's Quit the Drug War|url=https://www.cato.org/publications/commentary/lets-quit-drug-war|website=Cato Institute|accessdate=24 April 2018|language=en|date=17 March 1988|quote=This article originally appeared in the New York Times on March 17, 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Drug decriminalization ===
Drug decriminalization calls for reduced control and penalties compared to existing laws. Proponents of drug decriminalization generally support the use of [[Fine (penalty)|fines]] or other punishments to replace [[prison]] terms, and often propose systems whereby illegal drug users who are caught would be fined, but would not receive a permanent criminal record as a result. A central feature of drug decriminalization is the concept of [[harm reduction]].

Drug decriminalization is in some ways an intermediate between prohibition and legalization, and has been criticized as being "the worst of both worlds", in that drug sales would still be illegal, thus perpetuating the problems associated with leaving production and distribution of drugs to the criminal underworld, while also failing to discourage illegal drug use by removing the criminal penalties that might otherwise cause some people to choose not to use drugs. However, there are many that argue that the decriminalization of possession of drugs would redirect focus of the law enforcement system of any country to put more effort into arresting dealers and big time criminals, instead of arresting minor criminals for mere possession, and thus be more effective.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

In 2001 Portugal began treating use and possession of small quantities of drugs as a public health issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/06/05/why-hardly-anyone-dies-from-a-drug-overdose-in-portugal/|title=Why hardly anyone dies from a drug overdose in Portugal|last=https://www.facebook.com/chrisingraham|website=Washington Post|language=en|access-date=2018-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means rather than incarcerating those in possession they are referred to a treatment program. The drugs are still illegal, the police just handles the situation differently. This also decreases the amount of money the government spends fighting a war on drugs and money spent keeping drug users incarcerated.
“As noted by the EMCDDA, across Europe in the last decades, there has been a movement toward “an approach that distinguishes between the drug trafﬁcker, who is viewed as a criminal, and the drug user, who is seen more as a sick person who is in need of treatment” (EMCDDA 2008, 22).6 A number of Latin American countries have similarly moved to reduce the penalties associated with drug use and personal possession” (Laqueur, 2015, p. 748).
[[Portugal]] is the first country that has decriminalized the possession of small amounts of drugs, to positive results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1893946,00.html | work=Time | first=Maia | last=Szalavitz | title=Drugs in Portugal: Did Decriminalization Work? | date=26 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anyone caught with any type of drug in Portugal, if it is for personal consumption, will not be imprisoned.

== Economics ==
There are numerous economic and social impacts of the criminalization of drugs. Prohibition increases crime (theft, violence, corruption) and drug price and increases potency.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

  | title = The Economics of Prohibition
  | url=http://mises.org/story/2269
   }}&lt;/ref&gt; In many developing countries the production of drugs offers a way to escape poverty. [[Milton Friedman]] estimated that over 10,000 deaths a year in the US are caused by the criminalization of drugs, and if drugs were to be made legal innocent victims such as those shot down in drive by shootings, would cease or decrease. The economic inefficiency and ineffectiveness of such government intervention in preventing drug trade has been fiercely criticised by drug-liberty advocates. The [[War on Drugs]] of the United States, that provoked legislation within several other Western governments, has also garnered criticism for these reasons.

=== Prices and consumption ===
Much of the debate surrounding the economics of drug legalization centers on the shape of the demand curve for illegal drugs and the sensitivity of consumers to changes in the prices of illegal drugs.&lt;ref name=Clark&gt;{{cite web|last=Clark|first=Andrew E.|title=The Economics of Drug Legalization|url=http://www.parisschoolofeconomics.com/clark-andrew/ecleg.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110809060914/http://www.parisschoolofeconomics.com/clark-andrew/ecleg.pdf|dead-url=no|archive-date=2011-08-09|accessdate=2016-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of drug legalization often assume that the quantity of addictive drugs consumed is unresponsive to changes in price; however, studies into addictive, but legal, substances like alcohol and cigarettes, have shown that consumption can be quite responsive to changes in prices.&lt;ref name=Grossman&gt;{{cite journal|last=Grossman|first=Michael|author2=Frank J. Chaloupka|title=The Demand for Cocaine by Young Adults: a Rational Addiction Approach|journal=Journal of Health Economics|year=1998|issue=17|pages=428}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same study, economists Michael Grossman and Frank J. Chaloupka estimated that a 10% reduction in the price of cocaine would lead to a 14% increase in the frequency of cocaine use.&lt;ref name="Grossman" /&gt;{{rp|459}} This increase indicates that consumers are responsive to price changes in the cocaine market. There is also evidence that in the long run, consumers are much more responsive to price changes than in the short run,&lt;ref name="Grossman" /&gt;{{rp|454}} but other studies have led to a wide range of conclusions.&lt;ref name=Levitt&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kuiemko|first=Ilyana|author2=Steven D. Levitt|title=Empirical Analysis of Imprisoning Drug Offenders|journal=Journal of Public Economics|year=2003|issue=9-10|volume=88|doi=10.1016/s0047-2727(03)00020-3|pages=2043–2066}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|2043}}

Considering that legalization would likely lead to an increase in the supply of drugs, the standard economic model predicts that the quantity of drugs consumed would rise and the prices would fall.&lt;ref name="Grossman" /&gt;{{rp|428}} However, Andrew E. Clark, an economist who has studied the effects of drug legalization, suggests that a [[specific tax]], or [[sin tax]], would counteract the increase in consumption.&lt;ref name="Clark" /&gt;{{rp|3}}

=== Associated costs ===
Proponents of drug prohibition argue that many negative [[externalities]], or third party costs, are associated with the consumption of illegal drugs.,&lt;ref name="Levitt" /&gt;{{rp|2043}}&lt;ref name=Miron&gt;{{cite journal|last=Miron|first=Jeffrey A.|author2=Jeffrey Zwiebel|title=The Economic Case Against Drug Prohibition|journal=Journal of Economic Perspectives|year=1995|volume=9|issue=4|doi=10.1257/jep.9.4.175|pages=175–192}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|183}} Externalities like violence, environmental effects on neighborhoods, increased health risks and, increased healthcare costs are often associated with the illegal drug market.&lt;ref name="Clark" /&gt;{{rp|3}} Opponents of prohibition argue that many of those externalities are created by current drug policies. They believe that much of the violence associated with drug trade is due to the illegal nature of drug trade, where there is no mediating authority to solve disputes peacefully and legally.&lt;ref name="Clark" /&gt;{{rp|3}}&lt;ref name="Miron" /&gt;{{rp|177}} The illegal nature of the market also affects the health of consumers by making it difficult to acquire syringes, which often leads to needle sharing.&lt;ref name="Miron" /&gt;{{rp|180–181}}
Prominent economist [[Milton Friedman]] argues that prohibition of drugs creates many negative externalities like increased incarceration rates, the undertreatment of chronic pain, corruption, disproportional imprisonment of African Americans, compounding harm to users, the destruction of inner cities and harm to foreign countries.&lt;ref name=Friedman&gt;{{cite news|last=Friedman|first=Milton|title=There's No Justice in the War on Drugs|newspaper=New York Times|date=1/11/98}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of legalization also argue that prohibition decrease the quality of the drugs made, which often leads to more physical harm, like accidental overdoses and poisoning, to the drug users.&lt;ref name="Miron" /&gt;{{rp|179}} [[Steven D. Levitt]] and Ilyana Kuziemko point to the over crowding of prisons as another negative side effect of the war on drugs. They believe that by sending such a large number of drug offenders to prison, the war on drugs has reduced the prison space available for other offenders. This increased incarceration rate not only costs tax payers more to maintain, it could possibly increase crime by crowding violent offenders out of prison cells and replacing them with drug offenders.&lt;ref name="Levitt" /&gt;{{rp|2043}}

=== Direct costs ===
A [[Harvard University|Harvard]] economist, [[Jeffrey Miron]], estimated that ending the war on drugs would inject 76.8 billion dollars into the US economy in 2010 alone.&lt;ref name=Bernd&gt;{{cite news|last=Debusmann|first=Bernd|title=Einstein, Insanity and the War on Drugs|url=http://blogs.reuters.com/great-debate/2008/12/03/einstein-insanity-and-the-war-on-drugs/|accessdate=4/1/12|newspaper=Reuter|date=12/3/08}}&lt;/ref&gt; He estimates that the government would save $41.3 billion for law enforcement and the government would gain up to $46.7 billion in tax revenue.&lt;ref name=Cato&gt;{{cite journal|last=Miron|first=Jeffrey A.|author2=Katherine Waldock|title=The Budgetary Impact of Ending Drug Prohibition|journal=The Cato Institute|url=http://www.cato.org/publications/white-paper/budgetary-impact-ending-drug-prohibition}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the war on drugs began under the [[Presidency of Richard Nixon|administration]] of [[President of the United States|President]] [[Richard Nixon]], the federal drug-fighting budget has increased from $100 million in 1970 to $15.1 billion in 2010, with a total cost estimated near 1 trillion dollars over 40 years. In the same time period an estimated 37 million nonviolent drug offenders have been incarcerated. $121 billion was spent to arrest these offenders and $450 billion to incarcerate them.&lt;ref name=AP&gt;{{cite news|last=The Associated Press|title=After 40 years, $1 trillion, US War on Drugs Has Failed to Meet Any of its Goals|url=http://www.foxnews.com/world/2010/05/13/ap-impact-years-trillion-war-drugs-failed-meet-goals/|accessdate=4/1/12|newspaper=The Associated Press|date=5/13/10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Size of the illegal drug market ===
According to 2013 data from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) and European crime-fighting agency Europol, the annual global drugs trade is worth around $435 billion a year, with the annual cocaine trade worth $84 billion of that amount.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.cnbc.com/id/100957882|title = CNBC|date = |accessdate = 11/10/15|website = Global drugs trade 'as strong as ever' as fight fails|publisher = CNBC|last = Ellyatt|first = Holly}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://irc.princeton.edu/pmunc/docs/UNODC%20BG%20formatted.pdf|title = UN Office on Drugs and Crime|date = |accessdate = 11/10/2015|website = |publisher = Princeton|last = Liebman|first = Jonathan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Drug bottle containing cannabis.jpg|thumb|right|Prior to prohibition, cannabis was available freely in a variety of forms]]
The cultivation, use and trade of [[psychoactive]] and other drugs has occurred since the dawn of civilization. In the 20th century, the United States government led a major renewed surge in drug prohibition called the "[[War on Drugs]]." It was only in the 20th Century that Britain and the United States outlawed cannabis. The British had gone to war with China in the 19th Century in what became known as the [[First Opium War|First]] and [[Second Opium War]]s to protect their valuable trade in narcotics.

Motivations claimed by supporters of drug prohibition laws across various societies and eras have included [[religious observance]], allegations of violence by [[racial minorities]], and [[public health]] concerns. Those who are not proponents of anti-drug legislation characterize these motivations as [[religious intolerance]], [[racism]], and [[public healthism]].

Various proponents of drug liberalization wish to repeal these laws for [[Arguments for and against drug prohibition|reasons]] ranging from [[individual rights]]-based defenses of [[liberty]], to [[consequentialist]] arguments against the economic and social outcomes of drug prohibition. Starting in the 20th century, large organized movements to overturn existing drug laws formed around the world. The most vocal of these groups exist in [[liberal democracies]], and typically attract [[Liberalism|liberal]] and [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] supporters, although drug liberalization itself is a non-partisan issue and may be supported by adherents of any ideology.

The campaign against [[alcohol prohibition]] culminated in the [[Twenty-first Amendment to the United States Constitution]] repealing prohibition on 5 December 1933, as well as liberalization in [[Canada]], and some but not all of the other countries that enforced prohibition. However, many laws controlling the use of alcohol continue to exist even in these countries.

Current proponents of drug liberalization seek the repeal or softening of drug prohibition laws, most commonly [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] but also including other [[controlled substance]]s such as [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]], [[tobacco]], [[opiate]]s, [[stimulant]]s, [[Psychedelic drug|psychedelics]], [[dissociative]]s, [[prescription drug]]s, and others.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

====Thailand====
Although [[Thailand]] has a strict [[drug policy]], in May 2018, the Cabinet approved draft legislation that allows for more research into the effects of drug marijuana on people. Thus, the Government Pharmaceutical Organization (GPO) will soon begin clinical trials of marijuana as a preliminary step in the production of drugs from this plant. These medical studies are considered exciting, new landmarks in the history of Thailand, because since 1979, marijuana is a drug and its use, storage and manufacture is illegal.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bangkokpost.com/news/general/1546686/medical-marijuana-trials-to-start-soon&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 9, 2018, the [[National Assembly of Thailand]] officially proposed to allow licensed medical use of marijuana, thereby legalizing what was previously considered a dangerous drug.

The National Assembly on Friday submitted its amendments to the Ministry of Health, which would place marijuana and vegetable kratom in the category allowing their licensed possession and distribution in regulated conditions. The ministry will review the amendments before sending them to the cabinet, which will return it to the National Assembly for a final vote. This process can be completed before the end of the year. Thus, Thailand may become the first Asian country to legalize medical [[cannabis]].&lt;ref&gt;https://420intel.com/articles/2018/11/09/where-do-thai-lawmakers-stand-legalizing-medical-marijuana&lt;/ref&gt;It is worth noting that the proposed changes will not allow recreational use of drugs. These actions were taken because of the growing interest in the use of marijuana and its components for the treatment of certain diseases.

Supporters of legalization argue that the legal market for marijuana in Thailand could increase to $ 5 billion by 2024.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.thestrategist.media/Thailand-Malaysia-to-legalize-medical-cannabis_a3309.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Czech Republic ====
In the Czech Republic, until 31 December 1998 only drug possession "''for other person''" (i.e. intent to sell) was criminal (apart from production, importation, exportation, offering or mediation, which was and remains criminal) while possession for personal use remained legal.&lt;ref name="Cz expl rep" /&gt;

On 1 January 1999, an amendment of the Criminal Code, which was necessitated in order to align the Czech drug rules with the [[Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs]], became effective, criminalizing possession of "''amount larger than small''" also for personal use (Art. 187a of the Criminal Code) while possession of small amounts for personal use became a misdemeanor.&lt;ref name="Cz expl rep"&gt;{{Citation

On 14 December 2009, the [[Government of the Czech Republic]] adopted Regulation No. 467/2009 Coll., that took effect on 1 January 2010, and specified what "''amount larger than small''" under the Criminal Code meant, effectively taking over the amounts that were already established by the previous judicial practice. According to the regulation, a person could possess up to 15&amp;nbsp;grams of marijuana or 1.5&amp;nbsp;grams of heroin without facing criminal charges. These amounts were higher (often many times) than in any other European country, possibly making the Czech Republic the most liberal country in the [[European Union]] when it comes to drug liberalization, apart from Portugal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.praguepost.com/news/3194-new-drug-guidelines-are-europes-most-liberal.html New drug guidelines are Europe's most liberal], The Prague Post, 23 December 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Czech Republic has also the highest prevalence of last years cannabis use among young adults (15-34) (18.5% in 2012) among the 30 counties reporting to the [[EMCDDA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/data/2014|title=EMCDDA – European Drug Report 2014: Data and statistics — the drug situation in Europe|work=europa.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the Regulation No. 467/2009 Coll, possession of the following amounts or less of illicit drugs was to be considered smaller than large for the purposes of the Criminal Code and was to be treated as a misdemeanor subject to a fine equal to a parking ticket:&lt;ref name="Cz reg"&gt;{{Citation

In 2013, a District Court in [[Liberec]] was deciding a case of a person that was accused of criminal possession for having 3.25 grams of methamphetamine (1.9 grams of straight methamphetamine base), well over the Regulation's limit of 2 grams. The court considered that basing a decision on mere Regulation would be unconstitutional and in breach of Article 39 of the [[Charter of Fundamental Rights and Freedoms|Czech Charter of Fundamental Rights and Freedoms]] which states that "''only a law may designate which acts constitute a crime and what penalties, or other detriments to rights or property, may be imposed for committing them''" and proposed to the [[Constitutional Court of the Czech Republic|Constitutional Court]] to abolish the Regulation. In line with the District Courts' argument, the Constitutional Court abolished the Regulation effective from 23 August 2013, noting that the "''amount larger than small''" within the meaning of the Criminal Code may be designated only by the means of an Act of Parliament, and not a Governmental Regulation. Moreover, the Constitutional Court further noted that the Regulation merely took over already existing judicial practice of interpretation of what constitutes "''amount larger than small''" and thus its abolishment will not really change the criminality of drug possession in the country.&lt;ref name="concourt"&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the above-mentioned amounts from the now-not-effective Regulation remain as the base for consideration of police and prosecutors, while courts are not bound by the precise grammage.

Sale of any amount (not purchase) remains a criminal act. Possession of "''amount larger than a small''" of marijuana can result in a jail sentence of up to one year. For other illicit drugs, the sentence is up to two years. Trafficking as well as production (apart from growing up to five plants of marijuana) offenses carry stiffer sentences.&lt;ref name="Cz criminal code"&gt;{{Citation

==== France ====
Following a contentious debate France opened its first supervised injection centre on 11 October 2016.  [[Marisol Touraine]], the Minister of Health, declared that the centre was "a strong political response, for a pragmatic and responsible policy that brings high-risk people back towards the health system rather than stigmatizing them."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-france-drugs-injectionroom-idUSKCN12B1KF|title=France opens its first supervised injection center for drug users|date=2016-10-11|newspaper=Reuters|access-date=2016-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The centre is located near the [[Gare du Nord]].

==== Germany ====
{{See also|Drug policy of Germany|Legality of cannabis by country#.C2.A0Germany}}
In 1994 the [[Bundesverfassungsgericht|Federal Constitutional Court]] ruled that drug addiction was not a crime, nor was the possession of small amounts of drugs for personal use. In 2000 the German narcotic law ("BtmG") was changed to allow for supervised drug injection rooms. In 2002, a pilot study was started in seven German cities to evaluate the effects of [[heroin-assisted treatment]] on addicts, compared to methadone-assisted treatment. The positive results of the study led to the inclusion of heroin-assisted treatment into the services of the mandatory health insurance in 2009. On 4 May 2016 the [[Cabinet of Germany]] decided to approve the measure for legal cannabis for seriously ill patients who have consulted with a doctor and "have no therapeutic alternative". German Health Minister, [[Hermann Gröhe]], presented the legal draft on the legalization of medical cannabis to the cabinet which is expected to take effect early 2017.&lt;ref name=cnn1&gt;{{cite web|last1=Berlinger|first1=Joshua|title=Germany to legalize medicinal marijuana by 2017|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2016/05/04/europe/germany-medicinal-marijuana/|publisher=CNN|accessdate=2 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Germany to legalise cannabis for medicinal purposes|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/05/03/germany-to-legalise-cannabis-for-medicinal-purposes/|publisher=The Telegraph|accessdate=2 December 2016|date=3 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kade|first1=Claudia|title=Ab 2017 gibt es Cannabis auf Kassenrezept|url=https://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/article154992002/Ab-2017-gibt-es-Cannabis-auf-Kassenrezept.html|publisher=Die Welt|accessdate=2 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cannabis als Medizin|url=https://www.bundesgesundheitsministerium.de/ministerium/meldungen/2016/cannabisarzneimittel-kabinett.html|publisher=Bundesministerium für Gesundheit|accessdate=2 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cannabis auf Kassenkosten|url=https://www.tagesschau.de/inland/kabinett-cannabis-101.html|publisher=Tagesschau|accessdate=2 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
==== Ireland ====
On 2 November 2015, Aodhán Ó Ríordáin, the minister in charge of the National Drugs Strategy, announced that Ireland planned to introduce supervised injection rooms.The minister also referenced that possession of controlled substances will be decriminalized although supply and production will remain criminalized.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Injection rooms for addicts to open next year in drug law change, says Minister|url = http://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/injection-rooms-for-addicts-to-open-next-year-in-drug-law-change-says-minister-1.2413509|website = The Irish Times|accessdate = 2015-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On July 12, 2017, the Health Committee of the Irish government rejected a bill that would have legalized medical cannabis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/health-committee-rejects-bill-to-legalise-medical-cannabis-1.3152230|title=Health committee rejects Bill to legalise medical cannabis|work=The Irish Times|access-date=2018-04-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Netherlands ====
{{See also|Drug policy of the Netherlands}}

The drug policy of the [[Netherlands]] is based on 2 principles:

# Drug use is a [[public health]] issue, not a [[criminal]] matter
# A distinction between ''[[hard drugs]]'' and ''[[soft drugs]]'' exists

Cannabis remains a controlled substance in the Netherlands and both possession and production for personal use are still [[misdemeanor]]s, punishable by fine. [[Cannabis coffee shop]]s are also illegal according to the statutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drugsweb.nl/drugsweb153.asp|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041212055950/http://www.drugsweb.nl/drugsweb153.asp|title=Landelijke wetgeving|archivedate=12 December 2004|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, a policy of non-enforcement has led to a situation where reliance upon non-enforcement has become common, and because of this the courts have ruled against the government when individual cases were prosecuted.

==== Norway ====
On 14 June 2010, the Stoltenberg commission recommended implementing heroin assisted treatment and expanding harm reduction measures.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encod.org/info/NORWEGIAN-COMMISSION-RECOMMENDS.html ENCOD.org: Norwegian commission recommends drug policy reform]&lt;/ref&gt; On 18 June 2010, [[Knut Storberget]], [[Minister of Justice and the Police (Norway)|Minister of Justice and the Police]] announced that the ministry was working on new drug policy involving decriminalization by the Portugal model, which was to be introduced to parliament before the next general election.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dagbladet.no/2010/06/18/nyheter/knut_storberget/narkotika/narkotikapolitikk/innenriks/12188316/ Dagbladet&lt;/ref&gt; However, Storberget later changed his statements, saying the decriminalization debate is "for academics", instead calling for coerced treatment.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.abcnyheter.no/borger/101228/justisministrenes-nei-til-avkriminalisering ABC Nyheter&lt;/ref&gt; In early March 2013, minister of health and care services [[Jonas Gahr Støre]] proposed to decriminalize the inhalation of heroin by 2014 as a measure to decrease drug overdoses.&lt;ref name=Dagsavis&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dagsavisen.no/samfunn/store-vil-gjore-det-l-ovlig-a-royke-heroin/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130504111356/http://www.dagsavisen.no/samfunn/store-vil-gjore-det-l-ovlig-a-royke-heroin/|title=Støre vil gjøre det lovlig å røyke heroin|archivedate=4 May 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 there were 294 fatal overdoses, in comparison to only 170 traffic related deaths.&lt;ref name=Dagsavis /&gt;

==== Portugal ====

In 2001, [[Portugal]] became the first European country to abolish all criminal penalties for personal drug possession, under Law 30/2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, drug users were to be provided with [[Drug therapy|therapy]] rather than prison sentences. Research commissioned by the [[Cato Institute]] and led by [[Glenn Greenwald]] found that in the five years after the start of decriminalization, illegal drug use by teenagers had declined, the rate of [[HIV]] infections among drug users had dropped, deaths related to heroin and similar drugs had been cut by more than half, and the number of people seeking treatment for drug addiction had doubled.&lt;ref name=cato&gt;[http://www.cato.org/pubs/wtpapers/greenwald_whitepaper.pdf Drug Decriminalization in Portugal: Lessons for Creating Fair and Successful Drug Policies], Glenn Greenwald, Cato Institute, April 2009&lt;/ref&gt; However, Peter Reuter, a professor of criminology and public policy at the [[University of Maryland, College Park]], suggests that the heroin usage rates and related deaths may have been due to the cyclical nature of drug epidemics, but conceded that "decriminalization in Portugal has met its central goal. Drug use did not rise."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Maia |last=Szalavitz|title=Drugs in Portugal: Did Decriminalization Work? |url=http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1893946,00.html|work=[[Time (magazine)|TIME]]|date=26 April 2009|accessdate=23 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ukraine====
The use of [[marijuana]] in [[Ukraine]] is not prohibited, but the manufacture, storage, transportation and sale of cannabis and its derivatives are under administrative and criminal liability.&lt;ref&gt;https://korrespondent.net/ukraine/3997959-v-oon-poschytaly-upotrebliavshykh-marykhuanu-ukrayntsev&lt;/ref&gt;

Speaking on the legalization of soft drugs in Ukraine has been going on for a long time. In June 2016, the Parliament received a bill on the legalization of marijuana for medical purposes. He dealt with changes to the current act “On narcotic drugs, psychotropic substances and precursors” and was registered number 4533.&lt;ref&gt;https://24tv.ua/ru/konoplja_protiv_maka_sostoitsja_li_v_ukraine_legalajz_n1053052&lt;/ref&gt; The document must examine the relevant committee, and then submit it to the government. It was expected that this would happen in the fall of 2016, but the bill was not considered.

In October 2018, a petition appeared on the website of electronic appeals to the President of Ukraine asking for the legalization of marijuana.&lt;ref&gt;https://dnepr.info/news/v-ukraine-podnyali-temu-legalizatsii-narkotikov&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2018, the State Service of Ukraine on Drugs and Drug Control issued the first license for the import and re-export of raw materials and products derived from cannabis. The corresponding licenses were obtained by the USA company C21. She is also in the process of applying for additional licenses, including the cultivation of cannabis.&lt;ref&gt;http://finance.bigmir.net/business/96326-Ykraina-vpervie-vidala-licenziu-na-proizvodstvo-prodyktov-iz-marihyani&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Latin America ===
{{Main|Latin American drug legalization}}

In the late 2000s and early 2010s, advocacy for drug legalization has increased in [[Latin America]]. Spearheading the movement [[Uruguay]]an government announced in 2012 plans to legalize state-controlled sales of marijuana in order to fight drug-related crimes. Some countries in this region have already advanced towards depenalization of personal consumption.

==== Argentina ====
In August 2009, the [[Supreme Court of Argentina|Argentine supreme court]] declared in a landmark ruling that it was unconstitutional to prosecute citizens for having drugs for their personal use - "adults should be free to make lifestyle decisions without the intervention of the state".&lt;ref name="N000645"&gt;{{cite news | first=Simon | last=Jenkins |authorlink= | title= The war on drugs is immoral idiocy.

==== Brazil ====
In 2002 and 2006, Brazil went through legislative changes, resulting in a partial decriminalization of possession for personal use. Prison sentences no longer applied and were replaced by educational measures and community services.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.druglawreform.info/index.php?option=com_flexicontent&amp;view=category&amp;cid=101&amp;Itemid=14&amp;lang=en Drug Law Reform in Latin America] (accessed 14 September 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; However, the 2006 law does not provide objective means to distinguish between users or traffickers. A disparity exists between the decriminalization of drug use and the increased penalization of selling drugs, punishable with a maximum prison sentences of 5 years for the sale of very minor quantities of drugs. Most of those incarcerated for drug trafficking are offenders caught selling small quantities of drugs, among them drug users who sell drugs to finance their drug habits. Since 2006, there's been a long debate whether the anti-drug law goes against the Constitution and principle of personal freedom. In 2009,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ocregister.com/articles/possession-678463-use-personal.html=en Brazil Supreme Court debates decriminalization of drugs], The Orange Conty Register, 19 August 2015&lt;/ref&gt; the Supreme Federal Court re-opened to vote if the law is Constitutional, or if it goes against the Constitution specifically against personal Freedom of choice. Since each Minister inside the tribunal can take a personal time to evaluate the law, the voting can take years. In fact, the voting was re-opened in 2015, 3 ministers voted in favor, and then the law was again paused by another minister.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120801044316/http://www.druglawreform.info/index.php?fid=45&amp;cid=574&amp;ord=1&amp;task=weblink&amp;option=com_flexicontent&amp;Itemid=37&amp;lang=en Too many in jail for drugs offenses in Brazil], Comunidad segura, 13 August 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Costa Rica]] has decriminalized drugs for personal consumption. Manufacturing or selling drugs is still a jailable offense.

==== Honduras ====
On 22 February 2008, [[Honduras]] President [[Manuel Zelaya]], called on the United States to legalize drugs, in order, he said, to prevent the majority of violent murders occurring in Honduras. Honduras is used by [[cocaine]] smugglers as a transiting point between [[Colombia]] and the US. Honduras, with a population of 7 million suffers an average of 8–10 murders a day, with an estimated 70% being as a result of this international drug trade. The same problem is occurring in [[Guatemala]], [[El Salvador]], [[Costa Rica]] and [[Mexico]], according to Zelaya.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080226143644/http://www.laprensahn.com/index.php/ediciones/2008/02/23/zelaya_sugiere_a_eua_legalizar_drogas Zelaya sugiere a EUA legalizar drogas]. laprensahn.com (23 February 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Mexico ====
In April 2009, the Mexican Congress approved changes in the General Health Law that decriminalized the possession of illegal drugs for immediate consumption and personal use allowing a person to possess up to 5&amp;nbsp;g of marijuana or 500&amp;nbsp;mg of cocaine. The only restriction is that people in possession of drugs should not be within a 300 meter radius of schools, police departments, or correctional facilities. Opium, heroin, LSD, and other synthetic drugs were also decriminalized, it will not be considered as a crime as long as the dose does not exceed the limit established in the General Health Law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elpensador.com.mx/2009/10/17/Ley-de-Narcomenudeo/ Ley de Narcomenudeo] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101130224127/http://www.elpensador.com.mx/2009/10/17/Ley-de-Narcomenudeo/ |date=30 November 2010 }}, ''El Pensador'' {{es icon}}, 17 October 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Many question this, as cocaine is as much synthesised as heroin, both are produced as extracts from plants.

==== Uruguay ====
{{Main|Legality of cannabis in Uruguay}}
Uruguay is one of few countries that never criminalized the possession of drugs for personal use. Since 1974, the law establishes no quantity limits, leaving it to the judge’s discretion to determine whether the intent was personal use. Once it is determined by the judge that the amount in possession was meant for personal use, there are no sanctions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.druglawreform.info/index.php?option=com_flexicontent&amp;view=category&amp;cid=108&amp;Itemid=21&amp;lang=en Drug Law Reform in Latin America], (accessed 14 September 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2012, the Uruguayan government announced plans to legalize state-controlled sales of marijuana in order to fight drug-related crimes. The government also stated that they will ask global leaders to do the same.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-18529993 Uruguay government aims to legalise marijuana]. ''[[BBC]]''. Retrieved 21 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 31 July 2013, the Uruguayan House of Representatives approved a bill to legalize the production, distribution, sale, and consumption of marijuana by a vote of 50 to 46. The bill then passed the Senate, where the left-leaning majority coalition, the Broad Front, holds a comfortable majority, the bill was approved by the Senate by 16 to 13 on 10-December-2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euronews.com/2013/12/11/uruguay-makes-history-by-legalising-entire-marijuana-market/|title=Uruguay makes history by legalising entire marijuana market|work=euronews}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill was presented to the President [[José Mujica]], also of the Broad Front coalition, who has supported legalization since June 2012. Relating this vote to the 2012 legalization of marijuana by the U.S. states Colorado and Washington, John Walsh, drug policy expert of the [[Washington Office on Latin America]], stated that "Uruguay's timing is right. Because of last year’s Colorado and Washington State votes to legalize, the U.S. government is in no position to browbeat Uruguay or others who may follow."&lt;ref&gt;Romero, Simon.

Retrieved 1 August 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2014, government officials announced that part of the implementation of the law (the sale of cannabis through pharmacies) is postponed to 2015, as "there are practical difficulties". Authorities will grow all the cannabis that can be sold legal. Concentration of THC shall be 15% or lower.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/uruguay-marijuana-sales-delayed-until-2015-president.aspx?pageID=238&amp;nID=68922&amp;NewsCatID=358|title=Uruguay marijuana sales delayed until 2015: president – AMERICAS|work=hurriyetdailynews.com|date=10 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2014 an opposition presidential candidate, who was not elected in the November 2014 presidential elections, claimed that the new law  was never going to be applied, as it was not workable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/uruguayan-pot-marketplace-smoke-24809375|title=Uruguayan Pot Marketplace May Go up in Smoke|author=ABC News|work=ABC News|date=1 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of 2016 the government announced that the sale through pharmacies will be fully implemented during 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.espectador.com/sociedad/344991/farmacias-conformes-con-demora-en-el-inicio-de-venta-de-marihuana|title=Farmacias, conformes con demora en el inicio de venta de marihuana|last=www.espectador.com|newspaper=ESPECTADOR.COM|access-date=2016-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{See also|Cannabis legalization in Canada}}
The cultivation of [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] is currently legal in [[Canada]], with exceptions only for Manitoba and Quebec. The recreational use of cannabis by the general public is legal with restrictions on smoking in public locations which vary by jurisdiction. The sale of marijuana [[seed]]s is also legal.

In 2001, ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' reported that a poll found 47% of Canadians agreed with the statement, "The use of marijuana should be legalized" in 2000, compared to 26% in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mapinc.org/drugnews/v01.n923.a01.html|title=Canada: Support Grows For Legalizing Marijuana|work=Media Awareness Project}}&lt;/ref&gt; A more recent poll found that more than half of Canadians supported legalization. However, in 2007 Prime Minister [[Stephen Harper]]'s government tabled Bill C-26 to amend the ''[[Controlled Drugs and Substances Act]]'', 1996 to bring forth a more restrictive law with higher minimum penalties for drug crimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=The Government of Canada Tables Legislation that Penalizes Producers and Traffickers of Illegal Drugs |date=11 November 2007 |publisher=[[Canadian Department of Justice]]|url=http://www.nationalantidrugstrategy.gc.ca/nr-cp/doc2007_11_20.html |accessdate= 6 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=39th Parliament – 2nd Session: Bill C-26 |encyclopedia=LEGISinfo |publisher=Parliament of Canada |date=30 August 2010 |url=http://www2.parl.gc.ca/Sites/LOP/LEGISINFO/index.asp?Language=E&amp;Chamber=N&amp;StartList=A&amp;EndList=Z&amp;Session=15&amp;Type=0&amp;Scope=I&amp;query=5330&amp;List=stat |accessdate=6 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bill-26 died in committee after the dissolution of the 39th Canadian Parliament in September 2008, but the Bill had subsequently been resurrected by the government twice. In 2016, the Liberal Party of Canada campaigned on a promise to legalize marijuana and has since passed legislation making marijuana legal across Canada on 17 October 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Government Re-Introduces Legislation to Fight Serious Drug Crimes |date=27 February 2010 |publisher=Canadian Department of Justice |url=http://www.nationalantidrugstrategy.gc.ca/nr-cp/doc2009_02_27.html |accessdate= 6 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Government Re-Introduces Legislation to Crack Down on Organized Drug Crime |date=5 May 2010 |publisher=Canadian Department of Justice |url=http://www.nationalantidrugstrategy.gc.ca/nr-cp/doc2010_05_05.html |accessdate= 6 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite |title=Trudeau says pot will be legal as of Oct. 17, 2018 |date=20 June 2018 |publisher=CBC |url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/cannabis-pot-legalization-bill-1.4713839 |accessdate= 24 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== United States ====
{{see|Decriminalization of non-medical cannabis in the United States}}
Throughout the United States, various people and groups have been pushing for the legalization of marijuana for medical reasons. Organizations such as [[NORML]] and the [[Marijuana Policy Project]] work to decriminalize possession, use, cultivation, and sale of marijuana by adults, even beyond medical uses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.norml.org/index.cfm?Group_ID=5059|title=NORML Policy on Personal Use|accessdate=26 August 2008 |publisher=NORML|date=3 October 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, 56% of California voters voted for [[Proposition 215|California Proposition 215]], legalizing the growing and use of marijuana for medical purposes. This created significant legal and policy tensions between federal and state governments. Since then, 20 more states and the District of Columbia have legalized and regulated medical marijuana. State laws in conflict with federal law about cannabis remain valid, and prevent state level prosecution, despite cannabis being illegal under federal law (see [[Gonzales v. Raich]]).

On 6 November 2012, Colorado and Washington state legalized possession of small amounts of marijuana for private recreational use, and created a process for writing rules for legal growing and commercial distribution of marijuana within each state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Legalization of Marijuana in Washington and Colorado|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/11/07/us-usa-marijuana-legalization-idUSBRE8A602D20121107|publisher=reuters|accessdate=10 January 2013|date=7 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2014 Midterms saw voters in Oregon, Alaska, and Washington, D.C. vote to legalize marijuana for recreational use.

In 2016, [[Adult Use of Marijuana Act|California Proposition 64]] was passed, legalizing private, recreational use of marijuana for those age 21 or older in the state of California.&lt;ref&gt;http://voterguide.sos.ca.gov/en/propositions/64/&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Australia ====
Australia has one of the highest percentages of marijuana smokers in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/australians-biggest-users-of-marijuana-and-speed-20120105-1pmyh.html | work=The Sydney Morning Herald | title=Australians biggest users of marijuana and speed}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993, HEMP (Help End Marijuana Prohibition) was established and continued the fight for law reform. In 2010, HEMP qualified as a political party and will be fielding candidates in elections where possible.

In 2011, the Cannabis Campaign seemed to experience a renaissance in Australia, no doubt due to developments worldwide, with many new groups appearing in different states, using social media as a conduit and forum. Since 1985, the Federal Government has run a declared "War on Drugs" and while initially Australia led the world in '[[Injecting room|harm-minimization]]' approach, they have since lagged. In 2012, the [[think tank]] Australia 21, released a report on the decriminalization of drugs in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.australia21.org.au/our_research/illicit_drugs_download.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130330145919/http://www.australia21.org.au/our_research/illicit_drugs_download.html|title=Australian Policy on Illicit Drugs, Downloads|archivedate=30 March 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'Harm-minimization' approaches towards [[MDMA]] and ecstasy have also met opposition. A trial of [[drug checking]] at the popular Spilt Milk festival was cancelled in October 2017. While organizers have blamed this on a lack of documentation sources allege that political pressure caused the cancellation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-10-13/pill-testing-advocate-says-pressure-to-blame-for-abandoned-trial/9045988|title=Music festival pressured to abandon pill testing trial, advocate says|date=2017-10-13|work=ABC News|access-date=2017-10-25|language=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents argue that pill testing is an important service considering Australia having the highest per capita use of ecstasy globally as well as some of the most adulterated pills.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.unodc.org/wdr2014/|title=World Drug Report|last=agt|website=www.unodc.org|access-date=2017-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2016, Australia legislated for some medicinal use cannabis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-10-29/medicinal-marijuana-to-become-legal-explainer/7975194 |title=Medicinal marijuana to become legal to grow in Australia — but how will it work? |first=Penny |last=Timms |work=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]] |date=28 October 2016 |accessdate=6 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Political parties ==
{{See also|Cannabis political parties}}

Many [[political parties]] support, to various degrees, and for various reasons, liberalising drug control laws, from [[liberalism|liberal]] parties to [[far-left]] movements, as well as some pragmatic [[right-wing]] intellectuals.  Drug liberalization is fundamental in the platforms of most [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] parties.

In the UK in March 2016, the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] became the first major political party in the country to support the legalisation of cannabis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.libdems.org.uk/liberal_democrats_call_for_a_legalised_cannabis_market# Liberal Democrats call for a legalised cannabis market].

'''Duncan Kennedy''' (born 1942) is the Carter Professor of General Jurisprudence (Emeritus) at [[Harvard Law School]]. He is best known as one of the founders of the [[critical legal studies|Critical Legal Studies]] movement in legal thought.

==Education and early career==

Kennedy received an [[Bachelor of Arts|A.B.]] from [[Harvard College]] in 1964 and then worked for two years in the [[CIA]] operation that controlled the [[National Student Association]].&lt;ref&gt;See [http://duncankennedy.net/documents/A%20Semiotics%20of%20Critique.pdf Duncan Kennedy, ''Symposium: Afterword, A Semiotics of Critique,'' 22 Cardozo L. Rev. 1147, 1166-67 (2001).]
&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1966 he rejected his "cold war liberalism."&lt;ref&gt;''Id.'' at 1167.&lt;/ref&gt;  He quit the CIA&lt;ref&gt;''Id.''&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1970 earned an [[Bachelor of Laws|LL.B.]] from [[Yale Law School]]. After completing a clerkship with [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] Justice [[Potter Stewart]], Kennedy joined the Harvard Law School faculty, becoming a full professor in 1976. In March 2010 he received an Honoris Causa (honorary degree) Ph.D. title from the [[University of the Andes (Colombia)|University of the Andes]] in [[Colombia]].

Kennedy has been a member of the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] since 1967. According to his own testimony, he has never forgotten to pay his dues.&lt;ref&gt;Duncan Kennedy, Harvard Law School Lecture, "Globalization of Legal Ideas and Ideology," April 14, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic work and influence==
In 1977, together with [[Karl Klare]], [[Mark Kelman]], [[Roberto Mangabeira Unger|Roberto Unger]], and other scholars, Kennedy established the [[critical legal studies|Critical Legal Studies movement]]. Outside legal academia, he is mostly known for his monograph ''[[Legal Education and the Reproduction of Hierarchy]]''*[http://www.duncankennedy.net/documents/Photo%20articles/Legal%20Education%20and%20the%20Reproduction%20of%20Hierarchy_J.%20Leg.%20Ed..pdf], famous for its trenchant critique of American legal education.

The '''Election Commission, Nepal''' ({{lang-ne|निर्वाचन आयोग, नेपाल}}; ''Nirvācana āyōg, Nēpāl'') is a constitutional body responsible for conducting and monitoring [[elections]], as well as registering parties and [[candidate]]s and reporting election outcomes, in [[Nepal]]. It was born out of the 1950 revolution in Nepal, and was established in law in 1951, although it has been changed somewhat by law over time. It has six members who serve for six-year terms, as established by the Constitution of Nepal. During the [[Nepalese Constituent Assembly election, 2008|Constituent Assembly elections in 2008]], it was criticized for not fully upholding its duties, but was acknowledged to have managed the elections well nonetheless.

The first election commissioner was Subarna Shumsher Rana in 1951 A.D.

The year 1950 was important in the [[history of Nepal]]: in that year, the [[Rana dynasty]], which had controlled the government for exactly 104 years, was overthrown.&lt;ref name=PG/&gt; The [[coup d'état]] marked Nepal's first attempt at democracy;&lt;ref name=PG&gt;{{Citation|last=Adhikari|first=Deepak|title=Nepal Takes Tenuous Step to Democracy|work=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]|date=2008-05-06|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/08097/870975-82.stm|accessdate=2009-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; one of the primary goals of the revolution was to eventually establish the [[Nepalese Constituent Assembly]].&lt;ref name=FIM&gt;{{Citation|last1=Skar|first1=Harald O.|last2=Cederroth|first2=Sven|title=Development Aid to Nepal: Issues and Options in Energy, Health, Education, Democracy and Human Rights|publisher=[[Routledge]]|year=1997|isbn=0-7007-1037-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The democratic experiment was short-lived; in less than ten years, [[Mahendra of Nepal|King Mahendra]] dissolved the government in favor of the [[Panchayati raj|Panchayat]] system.&lt;ref name=PG/&gt; However, another major accomplishment was the establishment of the National Election Commission in 1951.&lt;ref&gt;The Nepal Interim Government Act of 1951, Section VI, 69. states " The  superintendence,  direction  and  control  of  the preparation of the electoral rolls for, and the conduct of these election, and, including appointment of Election tribunals for the decision of doubts and disputes arising out of or in connection of with these election shall be vested in  this  Commission, which is referred to in this Act as the Election Commission."

The commission was declared by law to be independent of the government in 1966.&lt;ref name=EC&gt;{{Citation |publisher=Election Commission of Nepal |title=Historical Background&amp;nbsp;— Election Commission of Nepal |url=http://www.election.gov.np/EN/ec/historical.php |accessdate=2009-08-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090526112616/http://www.election.gov.np/EN/ec/historical.php |archivedate=2009-05-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This has been confirmed by Nepal's [[Constitution of Nepal|interim constitution]] in 2007.&lt;ref name=EU&gt;{{Citation |publisher=[[European Union]] |title=European Union Election Observation Mission to Nepal |year=2008 |url=http://www.eueomnepal.org/English/Legal.html |accessdate=2009-08-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091105195726/http://www.eueomnepal.org/English/Legal.html |archivedate=2009-11-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Composition==
It has five members, consisting of the Chief Election Commissioner and four others.&lt;ref name=EU/&gt; The members serve for 6 years.&lt;ref name=EU/&gt; In order to enforce its election guidelines, the commission employs a group of around 240,000 officials, mostly civil servants, to monitor elections.&lt;ref name=EU/&gt;

When the commission was established, the members were chosen by the King.&lt;ref name=EC/&gt; In 1989, [[Birendra of Nepal|King Birendra's]] constitution declared that the Chief Election Commissioner would still be appointed by the king, but the others would not.&lt;ref name=EC/&gt; The interim constitution further amended the body's composition in 2006: all five members were made under appointment of the Prime Minister.&lt;ref name=EU/&gt;

==Criticism==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4084">{{Politics of Guinea}}

A '''constitutional referendum''' was held in [[Guinea]] on 28 September 1958 as part of a [[French constitutional referendum, 1958|wider referendum]] across the [[French Union]] (and [[France]] itself) on whether to adopt the new [[Constitution of France|French Constitution]]; if accepted, colonies would become part of the new [[French Community]]; if rejected, the territory would be granted independence. 

Alongside [[Niger]], Guinea was one of only two territories where the major political party campaigned for a "no" vote,&lt;ref name=decalo97&gt;Samuel Decalo. Historical Dictionary of Niger (3rd ed.). Scarecrow Press, Boston &amp; Folkestone, (1997) {{ISBN|0-8108-3136-8}} pp. 56-59 ("Bakary"), 247-255 ("Political Parties"), 272 ("SAWABA")&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Fuglstad73&gt;Finn Fuglestad.

The results showed that more than 95% of voters voted against the constitution, with a turnout of 85.5%.&lt;ref name=AED&gt;{{cite web|url=http://africanelections.tripod.com/gn.html|title=Elections in Guinea|publisher=African Elections Database|date=12 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
Following the referendum, Guinea declared independence on 2 October. The French government reacted badly to the result, and although Touré had not been seeking it, withdrew totally from the country and halted any development assistance. As a result, the Guinean government turned to the Communist bloc to request aid, a step which the French government used in pressuring Western countries not to accept the Guinean independence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wilsoncenter.org/event/nationalism-and-decolonization-africa-during-the-cold-war|title=Nationalism and Decolonization in Africa during the Cold War|date=8 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon independence Touré assumed the office of [[List of heads of state of Guinea|President]], and the country soon became a [[one-party state]]. Despite various assassination attempts and coup plots, Touré ruled until 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sulima.com/pubs/guinea.htm|title=Guinea: A Historical Profile|publisher=Sulima|author=Mohamed Pathe Jalloh|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716162023/http://www.sulima.com/pubs/guinea.htm|archivedate=2011-07-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Harry Jacob Anslinger''' (May 20, 1892 &amp;ndash; November 14, 1975) was a United States government official who served as the first commissioner of the [[U.S. Treasury Department]]'s [[Federal Bureau of Narcotics]]. He was a supporter of prohibition and the criminalization of drugs, and played a pivotal role in [[cannabis]] prohibition.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John C. McWilliams |title=The Protectors: Anslinger and the Federal Bureau of Narcotics (1930–1962)|year=1990 |ISBN=978-0874133523|publisher=University of Delaware Press|page=187}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anslinger held office an unprecedented 32 years in his role as commissioner until 1962. He then held office two years as U.S. Representative to the [[Commission on Narcotic Drugs|United Nations Narcotics Commission]]. The responsibilities once held by Anslinger are now largely under the jurisdiction of the U.S. [[Office of National Drug Control Policy]].

==Early life and marriage==
Harry Anslinger's father, Robert J. Anslinger, was a barber by trade who was born in [[Bern]], [[Switzerland]]. His mother, Rosa Christiana Fladt, was born in [[Baden]], [[Germany]]. The family emigrated to the United States in 1881. Robert Anslinger worked in New York for two years, then moved to [[Altoona, Pennsylvania]]. In 1892, the year Harry was born, Anslinger went to work for the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]].

After attending local schools, Harry Anslinger enrolled at Altoona Business College at the age of 17. He followed his father in going to work for the Pennsylvania Railroad. In 1913, he was granted a furlough so he could enroll at [[Pennsylvania State University|Pennsylvania State College]], where he studied in a two-year associate degree program in business and engineering.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

==Rise to prominence==
Anslinger gained notoriety early in his career. At the age of 23 (in 1915), while working as an investigator for the Pennsylvania Railroad,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rowe|first=Thomas C.|title=Federal Narcotics Laws and the War on Drugs: Money Down a Rat Hole|year=2006|publisher=Haworth Press|location=Binghamton, NY|isbn=978-0-7890-2808-2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v1tz6nP6fdwC&amp;lpg=PA23&amp;dq=Harry%20J.%20Anslinger&amp;pg=PA50#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; he performed a detailed investigation that found the $50,000 claim of a widower in a railroad accident to be fraudulent. He saved the company the payout and was promoted to captain of railroad police.

From 1917 to 1928, Anslinger worked for various military and police organizations on stopping international drug trafficking. His duties took him all over the world, from [[Germany]] to [[Venezuela]] to [[Japan]]. He is widely credited with shaping not only America's domestic and international drug policies but influencing drug policies of other nations, particularly those that had not debated the issues internally.

By 1929, Anslinger returned from his international tour to work as an assistant commissioner in the United States [[United States Department of the Treasury|Treasury Department]]'s [[Bureau of Prohibition]]. Around this time, corruption and scandal gripped prohibition and narcotics agencies.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}} The ensuing shake-ups and re-organizations set the stage for Anslinger, perceived as an honest and incorruptible figure, to advance not only in rank but to great political stature.

In 1930, the 38 year-old Anslinger was appointed the founding commissioner of the Treasury's [[Federal Bureau of Narcotics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Filan|first=Kenaz|title=The Power of the Poppy: Harnessing Nature's Most Dangerous Plant Ally|publisher=Park Street Press|location=Rochester, Vt.|isbn=978-1-59477-399-0|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vDL9JQr_cCMC&amp;lpg=PA64&amp;dq=Harry%20J.%20Anslinger&amp;pg=PA64#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|page=64}}&lt;/ref&gt; Just as today, the illegal trade in alcohol (then still under Prohibition) and illicit drugs were targeted by the Treasury not primarily as social evils - that fell, if anywhere, under other government purview - but as losses of revenue since they could not be taxed. Appointed by department Secretary [[Andrew W. Mellon]], his wife's uncle, Anslinger was given a budget of $100,000 and turned loose.

==The campaign against marijuana (cannabis) 1930–1937==
{{Main|Legal history of marijuana in the United States }}

Restrictions on [[cannabis]] (''Cannabis indica'', often called "Indian Hemp" in documents before the 1940s) as a drug started in local laws in [[New York (state)|New York]] in 1860.  This was followed by local laws in many other states and by state laws in the 1910s and 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Senate.|newspaper=New York Times|date=February 15, 1860|location=New York City|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1860/02/16/news/senate-88150825.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The federal [[Pure Food and Drug Act]] of 1906 regulated the labeling of [[patent medicines]] that contained "cannabis indica". In 1925 [[United States]] supported regulation of "Indian hemp" as use as a drug, in the [[International Opium Convention]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.druglibrary.org/schaffer/history/e1920/willoughby.htm |first=W.W. |last=Willoughby |title=Opium as an International Problem |publisher=The Johns Hopkins Press |year=1925 |accessdate=February 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recommendations from the International Opium Convention inspired the work with the [[Uniform State Narcotic Act]] between 1925 and 1932.

Anslinger had not been active in this process until approximately 1930.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.druglibrary.org/schaffer/hemp/taxact/anslng1.htm |title=The Marihuana Tax Act of 1937: Statement of Harry J. Anslinger |publisher=Schaffer Library of Drug Policy |date= |accessdate=February 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.druglibrary.org/schaffer/hemp/taxact/t10a.htm |title=The Marihuana Tax Act, Additional Statement Of H. J. Anslinger |publisher=Schaffer Library of Drug Policy |date= |accessdate=February 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Prior to the end of alcohol prohibition, Anslinger had claimed that cannabis was not a problem, did not harm people, and "there is no more absurd fallacy"{{citation needed|reason=Quotation|date=November 2018}} than the idea it makes people violent.  His critics argue he shifted not due to objective evidence but self-interest due to the obsolescence of the Department of Prohibition he headed when alcohol prohibition ceased - campaigning for a new Prohibition against its use. Anslinger collected dubious anecdotes of marijuana causing crime and violence, and ignored contrary evidence such as doctor Walter Bromberg, who pointed out that substance abuse and crime are heavily confounded and that none of a group of 2,216 criminal convictions he examined were clearly done under marijuana's influence,&lt;ref&gt;pg44-46 of Sloman, ''Reefer Madness''&lt;/ref&gt; or a discussion forwarded to him by the American Medical Association in which 29 of 30 pharmacists and drug industry representatives objected to his proposals to ban marijuana. One such statement claimed that the proposal was "Absolute rot. It is not necessary. I have never known of its misuse.", although only the single dissenter (who noted he had once encountered a doctor who had been addicted to marijuana) was preserved in Bureau files.&lt;ref&gt;pg38-41 of Sloman, ''Reefer Madness''&lt;/ref&gt;

Anslinger sought and ultimately received, as head of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics, an increase of reports about smoking of marijuana in 1936 that continued to spread at an accelerated pace in 1937. Before, smoking of marijuana had been relatively slight and confined to the Southwest, particularly along the Mexican border.
 
The Bureau first prepared a legislative plan to seek from Congress a new law that would place marijuana and its distribution directly under federal control. Second, Anslinger ran a campaign against marijuana on radio and at major forums.&lt;ref name="anslinger"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.hempology.org/ALL%20HISTORY%20ARTICLES.HTML/1961%3B%20ANSLINGER%20MURDERERS.html |first=Harry J. |last=Anslinger | first2=Will |last2=Oursler |title=The Murderers, the story of the narcotic gangs |pages=541–554 |year=1961 |accessdate=February 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Erlen|first=Jonathon|last2=Spillane|first2=Joseph F.|title=Federal Drug Control: The Evolution of Policy and Practice|year=2004|publisher=Pharmaceutical Products Press|location=Binghamton, N.Y.

{{quote|By the tons it is coming into this country — the deadly, dreadful poison that racks and tears not only the body, but the very heart and soul of every human being who once becomes a slave to it in any of its cruel and devastating forms. ... Marihuana is a short cut to the insane asylum. Smoke marihuana cigarettes for a month and what was once your brain will be nothing but a storehouse of horrid specters. Hasheesh makes a murderer who kills for the love of killing out of the mildest mannered man who ever laughed at the idea that any habit could ever get him. ...&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://proxy.baremetal.com/www.drugsense.org/ds/reefermadnessrevisited_sample.pdf|title=Reefer Madness: Revisited|publisher=Doug Snead|accessdate=February 12, 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305055934/http://proxy.baremetal.com/www.drugsense.org/ds/reefermadnessrevisited_sample.pdf|archivedate=March 5, 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

By using the [[mass media]] as his forum (receiving much support from [[yellow journalism]] publisher [[William Randolph Hearst]]), Anslinger propelled the anti-marijuana sentiment from state level to a national movement. He used what he called his "Gore Files" - a collection of quotes from police reports - to graphically depict offenses caused by drug users. They were written in the terse and concise language of a police report. His most infamous story in ''[[The American Magazine]]'' concerned [[Victor Licata]] who killed his family:&lt;ref name="Licata"/&gt;

{{quote|An entire family was murdered by a youthful addict in Florida. When officers arrived at the home, they found the youth staggering about in a human slaughterhouse. With an axe he had killed his father, mother, two brothers, and a sister. He seemed to be in a daze ... He had no recollection of having committed the multiple crimes. The officers knew him ordinarily as a sane, rather quiet young man; now he was pitifully crazed. They sought the reason. The boy said that he had been in the habit of smoking something which youthful friends called "[[cannabis (drug)|muggles]]," a childish name for marijuana.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unclemikesresearch.com/victor-licata/ |title=Victor Licata |publisher=Uncle Mike's Library |accessdate=February 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The story is one of 200 violent crimes that were documented in Anslinger's "Gore Files" series.&lt;ref name="Licata"/&gt; However, it has since been proved that Licata never murdered his family because of cannabis use; the youth actually had a severe mental illness.&lt;ref name="Licata"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thursdayreview.com/VictorLicataPot.html|title=Victor Licata's Strange Legacy|publisher=''Thursday Review''|date=May 30, 2014|accessdate=February 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers have now proved that Anslinger wrongly attributed 198 of the "Gore Files" stories to marijuana usage and the remaining "two cases could not be disproved, because no records existed concerning the crimes."&lt;ref name="Licata"/&gt; During the [[Marihuana Tax Act of 1937|1937 Marijuana Tax Act]] hearings, Anslinger rehashed the 1933 Licata killings while giving testimony to congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.druglibrary.org/schaffer/history/e1930/licata/index.html|title=Research for Victor Licata|publisher=www.druglibrary.org|accessdate=February 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1930s Anslinger's articles often contained racist themes in his anti-marijuana campaign:&lt;ref name="Herrer 1985 Chapters 4 &amp; 5"/&gt;

One night, in 1939, [[Billie Holiday]] stood on stage in New York City and sang [[Strange Fruit]] and was instructed to stop singing the same song; it was provocation of Holiday's self-defence, to justify the [[existence]] and [[budget]] of Anslinger's Federal Bureau of Narcotics. When Anslinger was interviewed in 1954 about drug abuse, however, he mentioned nothing about race or sex. In his book ''The Protectors'' (1964), Anslinger has a chapter called "Jazz and Junk Don't Mix" about black jazz musicians [[Billie Holiday]] (who he had handcuffed on her death bed due to suspicion of drug use and possession&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hari|first1=Johann|title=The Hunting of Billie Holiday|url=http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/01/drug-war-the-hunting-of-billie-holiday-114298?o=0|publisher=Politico Magazine|accessdate=5 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and [[Charlie Parker]], who both died after years of illegal [[heroin]] and alcohol abuse:

{{quote|Jazz entertainers are neither fish nor fowl. They do not get the million-dollar protection Hollywood and Broadway can afford for their stars who have become addicted – and there are many more than will ever be revealed. Perhaps this is because jazz, once considered a decadent kind of music, has only token respectability. Jazz grew up next door to crime, so to speak. Clubs of dubious reputation were, for a long time, the only places where it could be heard. But the times bring changes, and as Billie Holiday was a victim of time and change, so too was Charlie Parker, a man whose music, like Billie's, is still widely imitated. Most musicians credit Parker among others as spearheading what is called modern jazz.&lt;ref name="Anslinger2"&gt;{{cite book|first=Harry Jacob|last=Anslinger|title=The protectors: the heroic story of the narcotics agents, citizens, and officials in their unending, unsuing battles against organized crime in America and abroad|publisher=Farrar, Straus|location=New York|LCCN=64016944|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P0JAAAAAIAAJ&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=%22hollywood+and+broadway%22|page=157|accessdate=December 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Anslinger hoped to orchestrate a nationwide dragnet of jazz musicians and kept a file called "Marijuana and Musicians."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Winter|first=Jessica|title=Pot, Porn, and Strawberries|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/2003-05-06/news/pot-porn-and-strawberries/|newspaper=Village Voice|date=May 6, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics of Anslinger believe the campaign against marijuana had a hidden agenda.&lt;ref name="Herrer 1985 Chapters 4 &amp; 5"&gt;{{cite book|last=Herrer|first=Jack|title=The Emperor Wears No Clothes|year=1985|publisher=Ah Ha Publishing, Quick American Archives|edition=11th|location=USA|isbn=0-9524560-0-1|chapter=4 &amp; 5|pages=330|url=http://www.jackherer.com/thebook/chapter-four/}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the [[DuPont|E. I.

However, the DuPont Company and industrial historians have disputed this link between development of [[nylon]] and changes in the laws for [[hemp]] (marijuana); the success for nylon was huge from start.&lt;ref name="Wolfe"&gt;{{cite journal|year=2008|title=Nylon: A Revolution in Textiles|url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/distillations/magazine/nylon-a-revolution-in-textiles|journal=Chemical Heritage Magazine|volume=26|issue=3|last1=Wolfe|first1=Audra J.|accessdate=20 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/fiberproductioni518dewe#page/68/mode/2up|title= Lyster Hoxie Dewey: Fiber production in the western hemisphere|publisher=United states printing office Washington|date=September 1, 1943|accessdate=February 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until 1934, and the fourth year in office, that Anslinger considered marijuana to be a serious threat to American society ([[Wallace Carothers]] first synthesized nylon on February 28, 1935). The [[League of Nations]] had already implemented restrictions for marijuana in the beginning of the 1930s and restrictions started in many states in the U.S years before Anslinger was appointed. Both president [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] and his attorney general publicly supported this development in 1935.&lt;ref name="rose"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=15024|title= Franklin D.

The [[La Guardia Committee]], promoted in 1939 by New York Mayor [[Fiorello La Guardia]], was the first in-depth study into the effects of smoking marijuana. It systematically contradicted claims made by the [[U.S. Treasury Department]] that smoking marijuana resulted in insanity, and determined that '"the practice of smoking marihuana does not lead to [[addiction]] in the medical sense of the word."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.druglibrary.net/schaffer/Library/studies/lag/conc1.htm The LaGuardia Report - Conclusions]&lt;/ref&gt; Released in 1944, the report infuriated Anslinger, who was campaigning against marijuana, and he condemned it as unscientific.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.druglibrary.net/schaffer/History/murd3.htm HARRY J. ANSLINGER: The Murderers THE STORY OF THE NARCOTIC GANGS, 1962]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later years==
Later in his career, Anslinger was scrutinized for insubordination by refusing to desist from an attempt to halt the [[American Bar Association|ABA]]/[[American Medical Association|AMA]] Joint Report on Narcotic Addiction, a publication edited by the sociology Professor [[Alfred R. Lindesmith]] of [[Indiana University Bloomington|Indiana University]]. Lindesmith wrote, among other works, ''Opiate Addiction'' (1947), ''The Addict and the Law'' (1965), and a number of articles condemning the criminalization of addiction. Nearly everything Lindesmith did was critical of the [[War on Drugs]], specifically condemning Anslinger's role. The AMA/ABA controversy is sometimes credited{{According to whom|date=September 2013}} with ending Anslinger's position of commissioner of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}

Anslinger was surprised to be re-appointed by President [[John F. Kennedy]] in February 1961. The new President had a tendency to invigorate the government with more youthful civil servants, and by 1962, Anslinger was 70 years old, the mandatory age for retirement in his position. In addition, during the previous year he had witnessed his wife Martha's slow and agonizing death due to heart failure, and had lost some of his drive and ambition.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} He submitted his resignation to President Kennedy on his 70th birthday, May 20, 1962. Since Kennedy did not have a successor, Anslinger stayed in his $18,500 a year ($145,733 when adjusted for inflation in 2014 dollars) position until later that year. He was succeeded by Henry Giordano. Following that, he was the United States Representative to the United Nations Narcotics Commission for two years after which he retired.

By 1973, Anslinger was completely blind, had a debilitatingly enlarged prostate gland and suffered from [[angina]].

On November 14, 1975, at 1 p.m., Anslinger died of heart failure at the former Mercy Hospital (now known as Bon Secours Hospital Campus of the [[Altoona Regional Hospital|Altoona Regional Health System]]) in [[Altoona, Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref name=obit&gt;{{cite news |author= |coauthors= |title=Harry J.

He was survived by his son, Joseph Leet Anslinger, and a sister. According to John McWilliams's 1990 book, ''The Protectors: Anslinger and the Federal Bureau of Narcotics (1930–1962),'' Anslinger's daughter-in-law Bea at that time still lived in Anslinger's home in [[Hollidaysburg, Pennsylvania]].

'''ImageMovers''' is an American independent film [[production company]] founded by director [[Robert Zemeckis]] and producers [[Jack Rapke]] and [[Steve Starkey]] in 1997. The company is known for producing such films as ''[[Cast Away]]'' (2000), ''[[What Lies Beneath]]'' (2000) and ''[[The Polar Express (film)|The Polar Express]]'' (2004). From 2007 to 2011, [[The Walt Disney Company]] and ImageMovers founded a [[joint venture]] animation facility known as ImageMovers Digital which produced two [[performance capture]]d animated films: ''[[A Christmas Carol (2009 film)|A Christmas Carol]]'' (2009) and ''[[Mars Needs Moms]]'' (2011) for [[Walt Disney Pictures]].

==History==
===Early years (1997-2007)===
ImageMovers' first seven films were ''[[What Lies Beneath]]'' (with [[Harrison Ford]] and [[Michelle Pfeiffer]]), ''[[Cast Away]]'' (with [[Tom Hanks]]), ''[[The Polar Express (film)|The Polar Express]]'' (also with [[Tom Hanks]]), ''[[The Prize Winner of Defiance, Ohio]]'' (with [[Julianne Moore]]), ''[[Last Holiday (2006 film)|Last Holiday]]'' (with [[Queen Latifah]]), ''[[Monster House (film)|Monster House]]'' (with [[Mitchel Musso]], [[Sam Lerner]], [[Spencer Locke]] and [[Steve Buscemi]])  and ''[[Beowulf (2007 film)|Beowulf]]'' (with [[Ray Winstone]], [[Anthony Hopkins]], [[John Malkovich]], [[Robin Wright (actress)|Robin Wright Penn]] and [[Angelina Jolie]]).

===Disney/ImageMovers Digital (2007-2010)===
[[Image:ImageMovers Digital logo.svg|thumb|245px|ImageMovers Digital logo]]
In 2007, [[The Walt Disney Company]] and ImageMovers set up a [[joint venture]] animation facility known as ImageMovers Digital, a Marin County-based film company where Zemeckis would produce and direct [[3D film|3D]] animated films using [[Motion capture|performance capture]] technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Reuters | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN0545679120070206 | title=Disney, "Polar Express" director in animation deal | publisher=[[Reuters]] | date=February 5, 2007 | accessdate=November 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 6, 2009, ImageMovers Digital released their first film ''[[A Christmas Carol (2009 film)|A Christmas Carol]]'', a performance capture film based on the [[Charles Dickens]] [[A Christmas Carol|book of the same name]] and starring [[Jim Carrey]], [[Gary Oldman]], [[Colin Firth]] and [[Cary Elwes]] each in multiple roles. On March 12, 2010, Disney and ImageMovers announced that ImageMovers Digital would close operations by January 2011 after production on ''[[Mars Needs Moms]]'' was completed.

The '''Free Imperial knights''' ({{lang-de|link=no|Reichsritter}} {{lang-la|Eques imperii}}) were free nobles of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], whose direct overlord was the [[Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor]]. They were the remnants of the medieval free nobility (''[[edelfrei]]'') and the [[ministerialis|ministeriales]]. What distinguished them from other knights, who were vassals of a higher lord, was the fact that they had been granted [[Imperial immediacy]], and as such were the equals in most respects to the other individuals or entities, such as the secular and ecclesiastical territorial rulers of the Empire (margraves, dukes, princes, counts, archbishops, bishops, abbots, etc.) and the [[Free imperial city|Free Imperial cities]], that also enjoyed Imperial immediacy. However, unlike all of those, the Imperial knights did not possess the status of [[Imperial State|Estates]] (''Stände'') of the Empire, and therefore were not represented, individually or collectively, in the [[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)|Imperial Diet]].&lt;ref&gt;Gagliardo, J. G., ''Reich and Nation: the Holy Roman Empire as Idea and Reality, 1763-1806'', Indiana University Press, 1980, p. 12-13&lt;/ref&gt;They tended to define their responsibilities to the Empire in terms of feudalized obligations to the Emperor, including personal service and strictly voluntary financial offerings paid to the Emperor himself.&lt;ref&gt;Gagliardo, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

To protect their rights and avoid vassalage to more powerful nobles, they organized themselves into three unions (Partheien) in the late 15th century and into a single body in 1577, and fought to win recognition. This status, beholden only to the Emperor himself rather than through a more powerful noble, meant the Imperial Knights were "immediate subjects" (their fealty was unmediated by another lord).  As such, the Imperial Knights exercised a limited form of sovereignty within their territories.

The Imperial Knighthood was a regional phenomenon limited to southwestern and south-central Germany—Swabia, Franconia and the Middle Rhine area—zones which were highly fragmented politically and where no powerful states were able to develop. In northern and northeastern Germany, as well as in Bavaria and Austria, the local nobles, facing larger states and stronger rulers, were incapable of developing and maintaining their independence. They formed the territorial nobility.&lt;ref&gt;Hillay Zmora, "The Formation of the Imperial Knighthood in Franconia: A Comparative European Perspective", in ''The Holy Roman Empire, 1495–1806'', Edited by R. J. W. Evans, Michael Schaich, and Peter H. Wilson, Oxford, 2011, p. 283–284.&lt;/ref&gt;

The immediate status of the Imperial Knights was recognized at the [[Peace of Westphalia]]. They never gained access to the [[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)|Imperial Diet]], the parliament of lords, and were not considered Hochadel, the high nobility, belonging to the [[Nobility|Lower Nobility]].

== History ==

=== Origins ===

The Free Imperial Knights arose in the 14th century, the fusion of the remnants of the old free lords ([[Edelfrei]]) and the stronger elements of the unfree [[Ministerialis|ministeriales]] that had won noble status.

Around 1300, the [[Manoralism|manoral economy]] suffered contraction due to the fluctuation in the price of agricultural foodstuffs. Ministeriales who were in a stronger economic position were better able to survive the weakening of their basis as landowners. The vast majority languished in poverty, resorting to selling lands to the Church, or to [[brigandage]].

The minority of ministeriales rich enough to weather the crises soon came to be identified with the remnants of the free nobility, and were thus seen as constituting one noble order. By 1422, some of these nobles had achieved jurisdictional autonomy under the Emperor (‘[[Imperial immediacy|immediacy]]’), and the corporation of free imperial knights was born. The other ministeriales that did not manage to receive the status of immediate [[vassal]]s of the Emperor were gradually transformed into a [[titled nobility]] of free status: the [[Freiherren]] (Barons). By 1577, the Imperial Knights achieved the status of a noble corporate body within the empire: the ''corpus equestre''.

In the [[Peace of Westphalia]], the privileges of the Imperial Knights were confirmed. The knights paid their own tax (voluntary) to the Emperor, possessed limited [[sovereignty]] (rights of legislation, taxation, civil jurisdiction, police, coin, tariff, hunt; certain forms of justice), and the ''ius reformandi'' (the right to establish an official Christian denomination in their territories).  The knightly families had the right of house legislation, subject to the Emperor's approval, and so could control such things as the marriage of members and set the terms of the inheritance of family property. Imperial knights did not, however, have access to the Imperial Diet.

Concerning the rights of Free Imperial Knights, Joseph Friederich von Ledersheim wrote in 1715 (De jure et privilegiis nobilium liberorum et immediatorum, Von des H. Röm. Reichs Freyen unmittelbahren Ritterschafft Discursus):

Section XII: “…they possess forestry rights (ius forestae)…the right of hunting (ius venandi); the right to establish an archive (ius archivi, a right of sovereignty); the capacity to make laws (facultatem leges atque statuas condendi); to send ambassadors (ius mittendi legatos) not only to the Emperor but to other kings and princes and those of whatever status; the right to establish pacts (ius constituendi foederae), of conducting war (bellum movendi), of constructing fortifications and walling forts (fortalitia extruendi et arces muniendi); without the need for permission they are able to call and hold assizes….they acknowledge no court but that of the Emperor, even though they hold no fiefs of the Emperor; the privilege against new fiefs being erected, the right to arbitration (ius Austregarum) no less than other states of the Empire have, even if they hold certain mediate fiefs from another prince.”

Section XV: “they enjoy the freedom of religion (pace religionis fruuntur) and therefore of establishing the Protestant Religion in churches and schools not only in their own hereditary territories but also in those fiefs held from another state…they are able whenever they wish to abolish and introduce either religion [Catholic or Protestant] if they hold the position of vogt over the possessions.”

All matters relating to the Imperial Knights' legal status as immediate vassals of the Emperor (house laws, debt, etc.) were managed by the [[Imperial Aulic Council]].

=== Organization ===
[[File:Estates of Imperial Knights.jpg|thumb|Estates of Imperial Knights (Mainz)]]
Lacking access to the Imperial Diet, in 1650 the immediate knights organized themselves into three circles (''Ritterkreise''): the Franconian, Swabian, and Rhenish Circles. The Circles in turn were divided into cantons (''Ritterkantone''), each of which exercised a high degree of autonomy. Each canon possessed a directorate (''Direktorium''), led by a director (''Ritterhauptmann''), who was elected by life, and a council (''Ritterräte''), whose members were elected for fixed terms. The director and councilors were knights themselves, but the daily activities of the ''Direktorium'' were carried out by legal experts (''Konsulenten'') and committees (''Ausschüsse'') staffed by non-nobles.&lt;ref name=Epstein&gt;Klaus Epstein, ''The Genesis of German Conservatism'' (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1966), 617–18.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Knights as a group were governed by the General Directorate (''Generaldirektorium''). This exercised the ''jus retractus'', the right to buy back any land sold to a non-knight for the original price within three years, and the ''just collectandi'', the right to collect taxes for the upkeep of the knightly order, even on estates that had been sold to non-knights. The knights also had the right to tax their subjects directly, and also possessed the feudal rights to the ''[[corvée]]'' and the ''[[Ban (medieval)|bannum]]''. The knights' reputation for heavy taxes (the maligned ''Rittersteuer'') and high judicial fines rendered them an anachronism in the eyes of imperial reformers.&lt;ref name=Epstein/&gt;

From 1577 on, the Imperial Knights met in a congress called the ''Generalkorrespondenztag'' ("General Correspondence Diet"), but the Circles and especially the Cantons became somewhat more important as their proximity meant that their interests were more closely aligned. Some immediate imperial fiefs, however, fell outside the structure of the Circles and their Cantons. The autonomous barony (''Freiherrschaft'') of Haldenstein (in modern-day Switzerland) is an example.

By the late eighteenth century, the organization of the circles was as following:

[[File:HEILIGENRÖMISCHENREICHS1720.jpg|thumb|The Franconian Circle from ''Des heiligen Römischen Reichs ohnmittelbahr = Freyer Ritterschafft Der Sechs Ort in Francken'', 1720]]

'''Franconian Circle''' (six cantons)

* Odenwald (seat: [[Kochendorf]] near Heilbronn)
* Steigerwald (seat: [[Erlangen]])
* Altmühl (seat: [[Wilhermsdorf]] near Emskirchen)
* [[Baunach]] (seat: [[Nuremberg]])
* Rhön-Werra (seat: [[Schweinfurt]])
* Gebürg (seat: [[Bamberg]])

'''Swabian Circle''' (five cantons)

* Danube (seat: [[Ehingen]])
* Hegau-Allgäu-Bodensee (seat: [[Radolfzell]])
* Kocher (seat: [[Esslingen am Neckar|Esslingen]])
* Kraichgau (seat: [[Heilbronn]])
* Neckar-Schwarzwald (seat: [[Tübingen]])

(Note: The semi-autonomous District Ortenau was affiliated with canton Neckar-Schwarzwald. District Ortenau served as the chief organizational connection to the empire for the Alsatian immediate nobility that had been absorbed by the French reunions of the seventeenth century.)

'''Rhenish Circle''' (three cantons)

* Upper Rhine (seat: [[Mainz]])
* Middle Rhine (seat: [[Friedberg, Hesse|Friedberg]])
* Lower Rhine (seat: [[Koblenz]])

=== Immediate and mediate status ===

Whether or not an individual, an institution, or an area was directly subject to the Emperor's authority defined the status of ‘immediate’ and ‘mediate’ subject of the Empire (reichsunmittelbar, reichsmittelbar).  The distinction was not restricted to noble subjects of the Emperor; for example, a number of high officials in the imperial courts and the chancery were immediate, whether noble or not.

Arising from the feudal connection between tenure of land and jurisdiction, the status of immediate subject was further distinct from that of a state of the Empire. There were many immediate territories that were not states of the Empire, and there could be states that were not immediate. Examples of tiny immediate territories include villages ([[Gochsheim]] and [[Sennfeld]] near [[Schweinfurt]]), and some farms in Upper Swabia. The status of immediate subject of the Emperor could be held by an institution: the family of Thurn und Taxis held the imperial post as an immediate fief from the Emperor.

Mediate entities were subjects arranged under an intermediate jurisdiction between the entity itself and the Emperor.

=== Role in the Empire ===

The Imperial Knights were called very often to war by the emperor and therefore won significant influence in the Military and the Administration of the Empire and also over the more powerful nobles.  Every Canton had its own ''Ritterhauptmann'' or Captain and kept detailed records of noble families and properties.  The Imperial Knights were exempt from imperial taxes and were not required to quarter troops.

=== Decline ===

Over time the title of Imperial Knight became a title of nobility rather than occupation.  Many Imperial Knights even as early as the 16th century are more famous for their scholarly, artistic, or diplomatic work than their military achievements. During the demise of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] in 1803, the Knights' estates, which were generally [[enclave]]s, were seized by the great [[territorial state]]s like [[Electorate of Bavaria|Bavaria]] and [[Duchy of Württemberg|Württemberg]] in the so-called ''[[Rittersturm]]''. In 1806, the [[Treaty of the Confederation of the Rhine]] gave the great states unilateral powers and the Imperial Knights' possessions, hitherto completely independent under the Emperor, formally became part of the territories of the higher rulers, by whose territory they were surrounded.  They, for the most part, took the title of ''[[Freiherr]]'' and submitted themselves to their new lords.

=== Numbers and membership ===
[[File:Estates of Imperial Knights (Fulda).jpg|thumb|Estates of Imperial Knights (Fulda)]]
Exact numbers of Free Imperial Knights are difficult to assess. It is often stated that there were 350 knightly families in all three Circles, owning around 1,500 estates (around 200 [[German obsolete units of measurement|German square miles]], or about 4,400 [[Imperial units|English square miles]]), with a total population of 350,000–450,000 inhabitants. These figures, however, are drawn from claims for compensation made after the upheavals of the French Revolution, and are more accurate for their description of geographical extent than of the total membership in the order. There were at least 400 families possessing land and many more of knightly rank that did not possess land, the so-called ''Personalisten''. With these latter included, the total number of knightly families rises to perhaps as high as 500. The discrepancies in the numbers stem from the list of membership for the Lower Rhenish canton being incomplete and from the absence of ''Personalisten'' from the claims of compensation.&lt;ref&gt;Godsey (2004), p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

From early on, the membership of the corporation of Imperial Knights controlled access to admission to its Circles and Cantons. There were two kinds of membership possible within the order: personal and landed. Landed members were families enrolled in a Circle and Canton who owned an immediate fief, and thus were subordinate to the Emperor directly.  The personal members (Personalisten) were non-landed members – regularly admitted – who had not yet acquired estates under knightly jurisdiction. As a result, the Personalisten were not included in claims made for compensation. Consequently, the numbers of landed families were probably closer to 400, with the Personalisten adding another 100, bringing the total number of knightly families to around 500 at the time of the corporation's dissolution.

'''Institute of Competition Law''' (or Institut de droit de la concurrence) is a [[think tank]] focused on bringing together government regulators, private practitioners, and [[academics]] to study and shape [[United States antitrust law|antitrust]] policy on an international scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Institute|url=http://www.concurrences.com/Institute-20/|website=Institute of Competition Law|accessdate=1 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Institute seeks to foster discussion about antitrust or [[competition law]] and [[law &amp; economics]] by producing antitrust publications and hosting related conferences and events.&lt;ref&gt;''Id.''&lt;/ref&gt;  The Institute's publications include the Concurrences journal, the e-Competitions Bulletin, and a series of books.&lt;ref&gt;''See'' {{cite web|title=Legal Publishers|url=http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/Sites/Editeurs|website=LegiFrance|accessdate=11 January 2015}} (naming the Institute as a source of information for law &amp; economics and related regulation by the French governmental entity responsible for publishing legal texts online).&lt;/ref&gt;  To encourage written scholarship, the Institute holds an annual writing competition and honors authors for well-written pieces in the area of antitrust and law &amp; economics at the Antitrust Writing Awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What are the Antitrust Writing Awards?|url=http://awards.concurrences.com/article/what-are-the-antitrust-writing|website=Antitrust Writing Awards|accessdate=1 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to written works, the Institute holds frequent events, including an annual conference and topical seminars, to discuss pressing issues in antitrust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Institute|url=http://www.concurrences.com/Institute-20/|website=Institute of Competition Law|accessdate=1 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==About the Institute==

After practicing competition law for many years, Nicolas Charbit founded the Institute in 2004 and currently serves as its CEO.&lt;ref&gt;''Id.''&lt;/ref&gt;  The organization maintains offices in [[Paris]], France and [[New York City]].

The Institute seeks to create an independent, objective platform for the development and discussion of antitrust law, [[economics]], and government regulation of competition.&lt;ref&gt;''Id.''&lt;/ref&gt;  The Institute works to maintain a balanced perspective by implementing [[editorial board]]s and scientific or [[steering committee]]s to oversee each of its publications and events.&lt;ref&gt;''Id.''&lt;/ref&gt;  These boards and committees are made up of international competition law experts coming from the government, private practice, and academia.&lt;ref&gt;''Id.''&lt;/ref&gt;  Such antitrust figures, including [[William Kovacic]], [[Mario Monti]], and Frédéric Jenny, serve on boards and committees for the Institute.&lt;ref&gt;''Id.''&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Concurrences''==

''Concurrences'' is a quarterly [[Peer review|peer-reviewed]] journal that is released in print and online to discuss national and [[European Union]] competition laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Concurrences?|url=http://www.concurrences.com/Journal/Details/What-is-Concurrences|website=Institute of Competition Law|accessdate=1 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The journal serves as a written forum for individuals in academia and private practice to analyze antitrust issues.&lt;ref&gt;''See, e.g.''{{cite web|last1=Wright|first1=Joshua D.|title=Revisiting antitrust institutions:The case for guidelines to recalibrate the Federal Trade Commission's section 5 unfair methods of competition authority|url=http://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/documents/public_statements/siting-antitrust-institutions-case-guidelines-recalibrate-federal-trade-commissions-section-5-unfair/concurrences-4-2013.pdf|website=Federal Trade Commission|accessdate=11 January 2015}}(reprinting Commissioner Wright's discussion of Section 5 guidelines, a hot regulatory issue at the time, in the Concurrences Journal on the FTC website); {{cite web|last1=Amelio|first1=Andrea &amp; Daniel Donath|title=Market definition in recent EC merger investigations: The role of empirical analysis|url=http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/competition/economist/merger_investigations.pdf|website=European Commission|accessdate=11 January 2015}}(reprinting an article from Concurrences Journal written by two members of the Chief Economist Team for DG Comp, the European Commission's agency regulating competition law, on the European Commission government website).&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, representatives of the Journal have interviewed influential figures in competition law, including [[François Hollande]], [[Christine Lagarde]], and [[Nicolas Sarkozy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Concurrences?|url=http://www.concurrences.com/Journal/Details/What-is-Concurrences|website=Institute of Competition Law|accessdate=11 January 2015}}; {{cite web|title=William Kovacic: A new Chairman for the US FTC|url=http://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/public_statements/417901/2008concurrencesinterview.pdf|website=Federal Trade Commission|accessdate=11 January 2015}} (reprinting a Concurrences Journal interview with Former Commissioner Bill Kovacic on the FTC website); {{cite web|title=Eleanor Fox: Networking the World|url=http://www.antitrustinstitute.org/sites/default/files/_02Concurrences_4-2011_-_Interview_E%20_Fox.pdf|website=American Antitrust Institute|accessdate=12 January 2015}} (reprinting an interview with Eleanor Fox, serving under Presidents Clinton and Carter on committees concerning competition policy, on the website of [[American Antitrust Institute]]).&lt;/ref&gt;  Since its inception, Concurrences has published approximately 14,000 articles from 1,000 authors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Concurrences?|url=http://www.concurrences.com/Journal/Details/What-is-Concurrences|website=Institute of Competition Law|accessdate=11 January 2015}} (statistics as of October 1, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;  One-quarter of these articles are printed in English, and the remaining three-quarters is printed in French because French is the official language of the [[General Court (European Union)|European Union General Court]].&lt;ref&gt;''Id.''&lt;/ref&gt;  All articles are accompanied by an [[Abstract (law)|abstract]] in English.&lt;ref&gt;''Id.''&lt;/ref&gt;

A Scientific Committee establishes strict editing and [[peer review]] requirements that an article must satisfy in order to be published.&lt;ref&gt;''Id.''&lt;/ref&gt;  Concurrences also categorizes each article into one of ten different formats, which signals to the reader the type of article that he/she is reading, particularly whether an article is academic or opinion in nature.&lt;ref&gt;''Id.''&lt;/ref&gt;  The ten article formats are as follows: (1) forewords (pure opinion pieces); (2) interviews of experts; (3) trends (several short articles on a current pressing issue in antitrust); (4) law &amp; economics (short papers by economists); (5) doctrines (longer academic papers); (6) case summaries (short analyses of recent antitrust cases); (7) legal practice (pieces for in-house counsel); (8) international (papers devoted to international antitrust policy); (9) [[book review]]s (of longer antitrust works); and (10) [[article review]]s (of prominent antitrust articles).&lt;ref&gt;''Id.''&lt;/ref&gt;  The Scientific Committee seeks to strike a balance between academic and opinion pieces and, thus, includes an article from most, if not all, of the ten formats in each issue.&lt;ref&gt;''Id.''&lt;/ref&gt;

==E-Competitions Bulletin==

The e-Competitions Bulletin is an online database of antitrust case summaries from 55 [[jurisdiction]]s, including the [[United States]], the European Union, and the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is e-Competitions?|url=http://www.concurrences.com/Bulletin/What-is-e-Competitions-14205|website=Institute of Competition Law|accessdate=1 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The goal of e-Competitions is to encourage direct comparison of antitrust case law and regulations across nations.&lt;ref&gt;''Id.''&lt;/ref&gt;  Each summary includes the following: key words to make it more easily searchable, the relevant law or regulation at issue, and a link to the full, original decision in a case or the original wording of a regulation.&lt;ref&gt;''Id.''&lt;/ref&gt;  The e-Competitions database contains over 10,000 case summaries with contributions from 2,500 authors, hailing from academia, private practice, corporations, and the government.&lt;ref&gt;''Id.'' (statistics as of October 1, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;  e-Competitions has received contributions from some antitrust figures, such as Claus-Dieter Ehlermann (former DG COMP Director General), William Kolasky ([[Hughes Hubbard &amp; Reed]]), and Ian Forrester ([[White &amp; Case]]), and has partnered with international law firms and 14 university research centers.&lt;ref&gt;''Id.''&lt;/ref&gt;  Like the Concurrences journal, e-Competitions is led by a diverse advisory board and editorial board.&lt;ref&gt;''Id.'' (see testimonials).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Books==

The Institute publishes two series of books, the e-Competitions series and the Concurrences series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Books|url=http://www.concurrences.com/Books-1381/Books|website=Institute of Competition Law|accessdate=1 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Each year, the e-Competitions series includes a Competition Digest and a [[Liber amicorum|Liber Amicorum]], which is a book that honors a well-respected figure in the field of antitrust and consists of stories contributed by the individual's close friends and colleagues.&lt;ref&gt;''Id.'' (''see'' William Kovacic - An Antitrust Tribute Vol. 1 and Vol. 2).&lt;/ref&gt;  The Concurrences series publishes multiple works, including a compilation of speeches and discussions from the Institute's conferences, the thesis chosen for the Concurrences Award, and books written by academics and attorneys in private practice.&lt;ref&gt;''Id.'' (''see'' Day to Day Competition Law by Patrick Hubert at Clifford Chance).&lt;/ref&gt;

After publishing the Concurrences journal for 10 years, the Institute released “Why Antitrust?”, a book featuring 100 short articles by both experts and non-experts of antitrust and law &amp; economics, including contributions from [[Joaquín Almunia]] (former EU Commissioner), [[Arnaud Montebourg]] (former Minister of the Economics), and [[Jean-Louis Debré]] (President of the Constitutional Council).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why antitrust? (Preface for the book "10th Anniversary of Concurrences")|url=http://www.concurrences.com/Journal/Issues/No-3-2014/Doctrines-1567/Why-antitrust-Preface-for-the-book?lang=en|website=Institute of Competition Law|accessdate=11 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Antitrust writing awards==

The Antitrust Writing Awards aim to encourage scholarship in the areas of antitrust and law &amp; economics by honoring excellent written pieces in the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What are the Antitrust Writing Awards?|url=http://awards.concurrences.com/article/what-are-the-antitrust-writing|website=Antitrust Writing Awards|accessdate=1 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Awards are given in two separate categories, academic articles and business articles.&lt;ref&gt;''Id.''&lt;/ref&gt;  Articles qualify for the academic category if they have been published in an [[academic journal]] during the last year.&lt;ref&gt;''Id.''&lt;/ref&gt;  Alternatively, articles are eligible for a business award if they have appeared in a [[professional magazine]] or newsletter in the previous year.&lt;ref&gt;''Id.''&lt;/ref&gt;  For each category, academic and business, the Institute awards the best article in each of the following eight substantive areas: (1) general topics (including articles on antitrust procedure); (2) [[anticompetitive practice]]s; (3) unilateral conduct; (4) [[Mergers and acquisitions|mergers]]; (5) [[intellectual property]]; (6) private enforcement; (7) Asian antitrust; and (8) economics.&lt;ref&gt;''Id.''&lt;/ref&gt;  The awards are announced at an annual gala, taking place the first night before the American Bar Association Annual Antitrust Spring Meeting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=62nd Antitrust Spring Meeting|url=http://www.americanbar.org/calendar/2014/03/antitrust_law_2014springmeeting62.html|website=American Bar Association}}; {{cite web|last1=Wright|first1=Joshua D.|title=FTC v.

All articles are subjected to an international peer review process and vetted by a steering committee before being considered for an award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=62nd Antitrust Spring Meeting|url=http://www.americanbar.org/calendar/2014/03/antitrust_law_2014springmeeting62.html|website=American Bar Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Institute assembles separate steering committees to review academic and business articles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jury|url=http://awards.concurrences.com/article/jury|website=Antitrust Writing Awards|accessdate=1 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Academic Steering Committee is made up of 18 antitrust figures in academia, and the Business Steering Committee is composed of 22 in-house counsels with antitrust expertise.&lt;ref&gt;''Id.''&lt;/ref&gt;  After each steering committee narrows down the pool of articles, the Board chooses the winners in both the academic and business categories.&lt;ref&gt;''Id.''&lt;/ref&gt;  The Board includes some of the most distinguished individuals in the fields of antitrust and law &amp; economics: [[Douglas Ginsburg]], Andreas Mundt, [[Howard Shelanski]], and [[Joshua D. Wright|Joshua Wright]].&lt;ref&gt;''Id.''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conferences==

The Institute hosts a series of conferences and events each year to encourage scholars, regulators, and practitioners to discuss antitrust policy in person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Institute|url=http://www.concurrences.com/Institute-20/|website=Institute of Competition Law|accessdate=1 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The biggest event put on by the Institute is its annual conference called New Frontiers of Antitrust.&lt;ref&gt;''Id.''&lt;/ref&gt;  The event is held in Paris at the [[National Assembly (France)|National Assembly]] or the Ministry of Economics with the EU Commissioner delivering the opening speech.&lt;ref&gt;''Id.''&lt;/ref&gt;  Regular speakers include Wouter Wills (EU Hearing Officer), [[William Kovacic]] (George Washington University), Bruno Lasserre (Autorité de la concurrence), and Laurence Idot (University Panthéon-Sorbonne).&lt;ref&gt;''See, e.g.,'' {{cite web|last1=De Coninck|first1=Raphael|title=Quantifying Antitrust Damages in Civil Proceedings: A Pragmatic Approach|url=http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/competition/economist/deconinck_at_damages.pdf|website=European Commission}}(reprinting a speech by a member of the Chief Economist Team for DG Comp, European Commission, given at the New Frontiers Antitrust Conference on the European Commission website).&lt;/ref&gt;  The Institute also organizes events specifically to enlighten in-house counsel about antitrust-related topics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Institute|url=http://www.concurrences.com/Institute-20/|website=Institute of Competition Law|accessdate=1 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  To that end, the Institute holds 10 seminars on the topic of [[industrial economics]] and 10 seminars on antitrust law procedures over the course of a year.&lt;ref&gt;''Id.''&lt;/ref&gt;  The Institute also arranges for dinners where government enforcers, private practitioners, and in-house counsel can discuss antitrust issues.&lt;ref&gt;''Id.''&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of its high level of immigration and emigration and its status as common source and destination for a large amount of international travel the United States has more incoming and outgoing [[international child abduction]]s per year than any other country.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}  To address this issue the United States played an active role in the drafting of the 1980 [[Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction]] (commonly referred to as the ''Hague Abduction Convention'' or simply the ''Abduction Convention''.)  Although the United States was one of the first nations to sign the Convention in 1981 the Convention did not enter into force for the US until 1988 with the enactment by Congress of the [[International Child Abduction Remedies Act]] which translated the Convention into US law.&lt;ref name="Hcch.net"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hcch.net/index_en.php?act=conventions.status&amp;cid=24 |title=Status Table of the Permanent Bureau of the Hague Conference |publisher=Hcch.net |date=1980-10-25 |accessdate=2010-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the [[Hague Abduction Convention]] the United States is required to fulfill many requirements designed to protect children from the harmful effects of international child abduction.  Domestic and foreign parents and attorneys have criticized the United States for its alleged failures to adequately fulfill these obligations on behalf of foreign and domestic families and children and in violation of international law.

==United States Legal System and International Abduction==
{{further|Law of the United States}}
[[File:Constitution of the United States, page 1.jpg|thumb|The [[United States Constitution]], the supreme law of the United States]]

The '''law of the United States''' consists of many levels&lt;ref&gt;See Stephen Elias and Susan Levinkind, ''Legal Research: How to Find &amp; Understand The Law'', 14th ed. (Berkeley: Nolo, 2005), 22.&lt;/ref&gt; of codified and uncodified forms of [[law]], of which the most important is the [[United States Constitution]], the foundation of the [[federal government of the United States|federal government]] of the [[United States]].  The Constitution sets out the boundaries of [[federal law]], which consists of constitutional [[acts of Congress]], constitutional [[treaty|treaties]] ratified by [[United States Congress|Congress]], constitutional regulations promulgated by the [[executive branch]], and [[case law]] originating from the [[United States federal courts|federal judiciary]].

The Constitution and federal law are the [[Supremacy Clause|supreme law of the land]], thus preempting conflicting state and territorial laws in the fifty [[U.S. state]]s and in the territories.&lt;ref&gt;William Burnham, ''Introduction to the Law and Legal System of the United States'', 4th ed. (St. Paul, MN: Thomson West, 2006), 41.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the scope of federal preemption is limited, because the scope of federal power is itself rather limited.  In the unique dual-sovereign system of [[Federalism in the United States|American federalism]]. Most U.S. law (especially the actual "living law" of [[contract]], [[tort]], [[criminal law|criminal]], and [[family law]] experienced by the majority of citizens on a day-to-day basis) consists primarily of state law, which can and does vary greatly from one state to the next.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence M. Friedman, ''A History of American Law'', 3rd ed. (New York: Touchstone, 2005), 307 and 504-505.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Graham Hughes, "Common Law Systems," in ''Fundamentals of American Law'', ed. Alan B. Morisson, 9-26 (New York: [[Oxford University Press]], 1996), 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

At both the federal and state levels, the law of the United States was originally derived largely from the [[common law]] system of [[English law]], which was in force at the time of the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]].&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, 12.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, U.S. law has since diverged greatly from its English ancestor both in terms of substance and procedure, and has incorporated a number of [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] innovations.

States are separate [[sovereignty|sovereigns]] with their own [[State constitution (United States)|state constitutions]], [[state government]]s, and [[State court (United States)|state courts]] (including [[state supreme court]]s).&lt;ref&gt;[[Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|U.S. Const., Amend. X]].&lt;/ref&gt; They retain [[plenary power]] to make laws covering anything not preempted by the federal Constitution, federal statutes, or international treaties ratified by the federal Senate.  Normally, state supreme courts are the final interpreters of state constitutions and state law, unless their interpretation itself presents a federal issue, in which case a decision may be appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court by way of a petition for writ of [[certiorari]].&lt;ref&gt;See {{UnitedStatesCode|28|1257}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1922, the Court applied the [[Supremacy Clause]] to international treaties, holding in the case of ''[[Missouri v. Holland]]'', [[Case citation|252 U.S. 416]] (1920), that the Federal government's ability to make [[treaty|treaties]] is supreme over any State concerns that such treaties might abrogate [[states' rights]] arising under the [[Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Tenth Amendment]].

==Hague Abduction Convention==
{{Main article|Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction}}
{{further|International Child Abduction Remedies Act}}
[[File:Members and Non Members of the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction Hague Convention.svg|thumb|alt=Hague Abduction Signatories|Hague Abduction Signatories {{legend|#4973C5|State parties to the convention (members of the [[Hague Conference on Private International Law|HCCH]])}}
                       {{legend|#14D9E1|State parties to the convention (non-members of the HCCH)}}|350px]]

The [[Hague Abduction Convention]] is a [[multilateralism|multilateral]] [[treaty]] (in force since 1 December 1983) aimed at providing an expeditious method to return children who are victim of international child abduction. The Convention was drafted to “to secure the prompt return of children wrongfully removed to or retained in any Contracting State" diverse from their country of [[habitual residence]], and "ensure that rights of [[child custody|custody]] and of access under the law of one Contracting State are effectively respected in the other Contracting States.”

Although the United States was one of the first nations to sign the Convention in 1981 the Convention did not enter into force for the United States until 1988 with the ratification of the treaty and enactment by Congress of the [[International Child Abduction Remedies Act]] which translated the Convention into US law.&lt;ref name="Hcch.net"/&gt; This was 5 years after the entry into force of the treaty.

===Courts empowered to hear Hague Abduction Convention cases===
The United States has two separate court systems, a Federal court system and a State court system. Both types of courts have authority to hear a Hague Abduction Convention case, as established by the International Child Abduction Remedies Act. It is up to the parents of abducted children and their attorneys to decide whether to file a petition for return in State or Federal court.

Although the exact implementation varies by state (also because states are free to adopt their own organizational scheme for judicial matters), trial courts are the general [[court of first instance]] to hear a Convention case within the State court system.

===United States legal precedents in Hague Convention cases===

Since the enactment of the [[International Child Abduction Remedies Act|ICARA]] and simultaneous ratification of the treaty by the [[United States Congress]] allowed it to enter into force in 1988, a number of important, and precedent setting decisions have been made on the Hague Convention's interpretation within the United States by federal courts.

====Abbott v. Abbott====
{{Main article|Abbott v. Abbott}}
The first [[Hague Abduction Convention]] case to be considered by the [[United States Supreme Court]] revolved around a whether or not a child from [[Chile]] was "wrongfully removed," as understood by the Convention, when a ''ne exeat'' order existing forbidding the custodial parent from removing the child from the country.  The Court found broad acceptance for the view that a ''ne exeat'' right, or a right to prevent a child's removal from his country of residence, is roughly equal to "[[joint custody]]" and is, thus, a "right of custody."   Accordingly, when the child was removed from Chile in violation of Mr. Abbott's ''ne exeat'' right, the child was "wrongfully removed" within the meaning of the Hague Convention.&lt;ref name="Abbott"&gt;{{cite court|litigants=Abbott v. Abbott|docket=08-645|date=2010|url=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.plnavby=CASE&amp;court=US&amp;vol=000&amp;page=08-64508-645}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States Abduction Statistics==
{{Main article|Hague Abduction Convention Compliance Reports}}
[[File:Report on the Compliance with the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction (2010 edition - front cover).jpg|thumb|150px|alt=2010 Report Covert|2010 Report Cover]]

The US State department publishes yearly reports are known as the [[Hague Abduction Convention Compliance Reports]] (or: Compliance Reports) in which statistics are presented on child abduction. The publication is a requirement by the US Congress and treats both compliance with the convention by member states and information on child abduction cases in non-member states. The reports highlight countries that they are non-compliant with the convention or exhibit a "pattern of noncompliance."  Since 1999, Mexico has been cited every year as being non-compliant or exhibiting "patterns of noncompliance". The reports form the basis for statistics on the United States and international child abduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://travel.state.gov/pdf/2010ComplianceReport.pdf |title=2010 Compliance Report |publisher=Travel.state.gov |date= |accessdate=2010-05-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100528014323/http://travel.state.gov/pdf/2010ComplianceReport.pdf# |archive-date=2010-05-28 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Asia===
Only Hong Kong, Macau, Israel, Thailand and Sri Lanka, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan are contracting states to the Child Abduction Convention. Of these, Israel has been named several years as having "enforcement problems" in the complicance reports.

====Japan====
{{Main article|International child abduction in Japan}}

[[Japan]] is -with India- one of only two non-contracting states to the convention to rank as one of the top ten destination countries for the abduction of American children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://travel.state.gov/pdf/2009HagueAbductionConventionComplianceReport.pdf |title=Report on Compliance with the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction |author=Assistant Secretary of State for Consular Affairs |date=April 2009 |work= |publisher=United States Department of State |accessdate=25 October 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091018220035/http://travel.state.gov/pdf/2009HagueAbductionConventionComplianceReport.pdf# |archive-date=2009-10-18 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, there is a  year by year increase in abduction cases. In 2009, 73 outstanding cases involving 104 children who have been abducted to or retained in Japan by parents were reported.&lt;ref name="dad released"/&gt;  An additional 29 cases involve American parties in Japan with one parent denied access to their child.&lt;ref name="dad released"&gt;{{Cite news |title=Dad Released From Japanese Jail in Custody Fight |author= |newspaper=ABC |date= |url=http://abcnews.go.com/International/father-released-japanese-jail/Story?id=8833610&amp;page=2 |accessdate=27 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2010 report 79 child abduction cases were mentioned involving 100 children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Child custody division set up |author=MINORU MATSUTANI |newspaper=The Japan Times |date=3 December 2009 |url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20091203a2.html |accessdate=3 December 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A State Department official stated in 2008 that no child has ever been returned to the United States from Japan as a result of diplomatic or legal means&lt;ref name="ABC1"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Spirited Away: Japan Won't Let Abducted Kids Go|newspaper=ABC News|url=http://i.abcnews.com/TheLaw/Story?id=4342760&amp;page=2}}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The official stated he knew of only three cases where children have returned to America, two involving reconciliation of parents, and one in which a 15-year-old child escaped to the American embassy.&lt;ref name="ABC1"/&gt;

====India====
&lt;!--the US-specifics of this section is unclear. Should it be here at all?--&gt;
[[India]] is not a signatory of the Hague Abduction Convention and India does not consider international child abduction a crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/us/2010/12/06/japan-india-pressed-curb-child-abductions/|title=Japan, India pressed to curb child abductions|work=Fox News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indian courts rarely recognize U.S. custody orders, preferring to exert their own jurisdiction in rulings that tend to favor the parent who wants to keep the child in India. In the rare scenario that a case is resolved, it is usually due to an agreement between the parents, rather than the result of court orders or arrest warrants.

Cultural factors often impact child custody decisions in India. For example, Indian courts rarely grant custody to a parent residing outside of India, even if both the child and abducting parent are American citizens. Additionally, the courts tend to favor mothers when determining custody.

India does require the signature of both parents for an Indian passport to be issued to children younger than 18 years. India also requires exit permits for children.&lt;ref&gt;https://travel.state.gov/abduction/country/country_4441.html&lt;/ref&gt;

====Saudi Arabia====
[[Saudi Arabia]] is not a signatory of the Hague Abduction Convention nor are there any international or bilateral treaties in force between Saudi Arabia and the United States dealing with international parental child abduction.

In Saudi Arabia, child custody is based on [[Sharia|Islamic law]]. The primary concern of Saudi courts in deciding child custody cases is that the child be raised in accordance with the [[Islam|Islamic faith]]. Most custody disputes in Saudi Arabia are handled by the Islamic [[Sharia]] courts. In rare cases, the Board of Grievances, the most senior non-Sharia court, has ruled on custody disputes.

Saudi courts generally do not award custody of children to non-Saudi women. If the mother is an Arab Muslim, judges will usually not grant her custody of children unless she is residing in Saudi Arabia, or the father is not a Muslim. All Saudi citizens are considered to be Muslim.

Since Saudi women are prohibited from marrying non-Muslims, custody disputes between a Saudi mother and American father would be heard by the Sharia court, which would usually apply Islamic rules of custody. If the mother wins custody, the father is usually granted visitation rights. According to Saudi law, a child whose mother is Saudi and father is non-Saudi is not granted Saudi citizenship. However, even if an American father wins custody of his children, he may still need permission from the Saudi mother to remove the children from Saudi Arabia.

Normally, under Sharia law, a mother can maintain custody of her male children until the age of nine, and female children until age seven. In practice the courts favor keeping children within a strict Islamic environment. Sharia court judges have broad discretion in custody cases and often make exceptions to these general guidelines.

Even when a mother who is residing in Saudi Arabia is granted physical custody of children, the father maintains legal custody and has the right to determine where the children live and travel. In many cases, the father has been able to assume legal custody of children against the wishes of the mother when she is unable or unwilling to meet certain conditions set by law for her to maintain her custodial rights. For example, if the mother moves to another country, the father is entitled to have custody. A court can sever a mother's custody if it determines that the mother is incapable of safeguarding the child or of bringing the child up in accordance with the appropriate religious standards. The mother can lose custody by remarrying a non-Muslim, or by residing in a home with non-relatives. Sharia law allows custody of children to be awarded to the closest male relative of a Saudi father in the case of death or imprisonment of the father, even if the Saudi father has made clear his wish that the children's mother have full custody.

Custody orders and judgments of foreign courts are generally not enforceable in Saudi Arabia.  Courts in Saudi Arabia will not enforce U.S. court decrees ordering a parent in Saudi Arabia to pay [[child support]].

Women entering Saudi Arabia with the intent of visiting their children may do so only with the written permission of the father of the children. The father must file a "statement of no objection" with the Saudi Ministry of Interior before the mother will be granted a [[visa (document)|visa]] to enter the Kingdom. This includes Muslim fathers who are non-Saudi nationals. If the father refuses to sponsor the mother, or to authorize a child’s travel to another country, there is little that can be done to effect a visit. The U.S. Embassy and Consulates General are not able to help American parents to obtain visas to Saudi Arabia without a no-objection letter. Neither the U.S. State Department nor the U.S. Mission in Saudi Arabia may serve as a woman's sponsor. Women visitors are required to be met by their sponsor upon arrival in Saudi Arabia.

If a non-Saudi father wants to enter the Kingdom to visit his children, he can do so by applying for a Saudi visa with proof that his children are living in Saudi Arabia. Saudi authorities may consult with the mother if she is Saudi, who may be able to prevent issuance of the visa.

Some American Muslim parents have considered traveling to Saudi Arabia on [[Umrah]] (religious pilgrimage to [[Mecca]]) as a means to visit their children. However, issuance of an Umrah visa does not guarantee that a parent will be permitted to see his or her children once in the Kingdom. If a woman is not divorced, the Saudi Embassy has the right to ask for her husband's permission for another family member (e.g. son) to act as the mother's Mahram. If the mother is divorced, the Saudi Embassy will ask to see the divorce certificate before granting the Umrah visa. Women married to Saudis should keep in mind that even when they enter the Kingdom on an Umrah visa, they would need their Saudi husband's permission to depart the country.

Persons who obtain a visa for business or religious visits (Hajj and Umrah) with the intention of visiting their children may face legal penalties including detention and/or deportation. While visitor visas are issued for approved tour groups following organized itineraries, these visitors are not permitted to travel outside the set itinerary.

Before traveling to Saudi Arabia to visit their children, women should consider whether they obtained a complete Islamic declaration of divorce from the Sharia court in Saudi Arabia. Secular, American divorce orders are not recognized by the Sharia courts. Although an Islamic divorce can be obtained from several mosques within the U.S., it has been the experience of several divorced spouses in the U.S. that the Sharia courts in Saudi Arabia will not recognize orders originating from an American mosque. The purpose of obtaining a Sharia declaration is to establish the legal personal status of the mother prior to traveling to the Kingdom. If an American woman is considered to still be married, the "husband" can prohibit the woman from departing Saudi Arabia.

Exit visas are required to leave Saudi Arabia. The U.S. Embassy or Consulates General cannot obtain exit visas for American citizens. Women must have permission from their husband or father to exit Saudi Arabia. The government of Saudi Arabia has been known to issue international arrest warrants against women who have taken their children from Saudi Arabia without the father's permission.&lt;ref name="SaudiArabiaFlyer"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://travel.state.gov/abduction/country/country_517.html |title=International Parental Child Abduction Saudi Arabia |publisher=[[United States Department of State]] |accessdate=2010-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Europe===
Most countries in Europe have are contracting parties to the Hague Abduction Convention, including all countries of the [[European Union]]. Most of these countries have never been mentioned in the compliance reports. Germany, Greece, Poland and Switzerland are notable exceptions.

====Germany====
The Hague Abduction Convention entered into force between Germany and the United States on December 1, 1990. According to the [compliance reports, 71 children abducted from the United States to Germany in 2009 and 20 children abducted from Germany to the United States during the same period.  Between 1999 and 2010 the reports have cited Germany as a "country of concern," having "enforcement problems," being "not fully compliant" or "demonstrated patterns of noncompliance" almost every year.

The Hague Convention came into force between the United States and Greece on June 1, 1993. Greece has been cited in the compliance Reports almost every year as either a "Country of Concern," having "Enforcement Problems," or "Demonstrating Patterns of Noncompliance."

Institutionally, the legal framework in Greece seems to support the necessary mechanisms for the Convention to function effectively. The Convention has force of law and has primacy over domestic law; first instance courts can hear Convention cases under expedited procedures (provisional or “emergency” measures), enforcement mechanisms exist and the Greek Central Authority will provide pro-bono legal assistance to victimized parents during Hague proceedings before the appropriate court in Greece.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://travel.state.gov/abduction/country/country_492.html |title=International Parental Child Abduction Greece |publisher=[[United States Department of State]] |accessdate=2010-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hague Abduction Convention came into force between the United States and [[Poland]] on November 11, 1992. Poland has been cited in the compliance Reports for every year from 2000 to 2008 as either a "country of concern," having "enforcement problems" or "demonstrating patterns of noncompliance" with the Hague Abduction Convention resulting in an ongoing dialogue between the Polish Consul General and the [[Office of Children's Issues]] Director in Washington, D.C. and U.S. Embassy officials and Ministry of Justice officials in Warsaw.  Several high-level meetings between U.S. Embassy Warsaw and the Polish Ministry of Justice have been held where Ministry representatives indicated an intent to address many of these compliance issues and improve Poland’s Convention performance.  Officials from the [[U.S. Department of State]] and the U.S. Embassy in Poland have raised compliance issues and individual abduction cases with high-ranking officials from the Polish Government through diplomatic notes, formal demarches, and communications with the Polish Central Authority with former assistant Secretary for Consular Affairs [[Maura Harty]] raising the issue during bilateral meetings with her Polish counterpart.

Among the issues cited in the Compliance Reports, there is no specific legislation that implements the Convention in Poland. Unless there is a voluntary return, children normally remain in Poland during the entire Hague process, which often takes years. There is a perception that there is a gender bias in favor of mothers when they are abducting parents. Even though enforcement legislation has been passed, there appears to be reluctance on the part of officials to follow through with enforcement.  A faulty translation into Polish of Article 13 of the Convention which radically lowers the standard for refusing returns by saying that return can be denied if it would put the child in an "unfavorable" rather than an "intolerable" situation that some courts still use four years after the Ministry of Justice agreed in 1999 to distribute an accurate translation. Furthermore, Polish law does not permit courts to consider resources for child welfare and protection in the country of habitual residence when asked to consider the grave risk defense.

Polish authorities are often unable to locate the children and their abductors after courts ordered the return of a child. Law enforcement in Poland is limited by the fact that neither parental abduction nor the failure to comply with a Convention return order is a criminal offense in Poland. Consequently, Polish authorities have fewer investigative resources available to locate children and their abducting parents.  The lack of an adequate domestic statutory framework with enforcement mechanisms (e.g., a parent who becomes a fugitive to avoid complying with a final return judgment does not commit a "crime"—and therefore cannot be the subject of a fugitive warrant—unless the parent has been stripped of parental rights.)

Refusing to obey an order seems to carry few negative consequences for the taking parent. In some instances, the court rewarded the taking parent who refused to comply with a court order by ultimately ruling that, because so much time had elapsed, it was not in the child's best interests to be returned after all.

Even in cases where the left-behind parent has provided specific information about where the child is located, the ability of the Polish authorities to verify it is ineffective.  Further, once a child is located, there does not appear to be any mechanism to ensure that abducting parents cannot further abscond or conceal the child's whereabouts.  This is largely due to the fact that international parental child abduction is merely a civil offense in Poland.

Courts routinely order psychological evaluations and home studies. In one U.S. case an abducting parent in hiding was able to protest a return order in court while also collecting child support payments from the government.  This situation indicates that institutionally there is a disturbing lack of coordination among local law enforcement, the Polish Central Authority, and social welfare agencies.

The Polish procedure does limit the number of courts that can hear Hague cases in an attempt to allow judges to develop Hague expertise and the Polish Central Authority will provide pro bono legal assistance for victim parents during Hague proceedings before the appropriate court in Poland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://travel.state.gov/abduction/country/country_515.html |title=International Parental Child Abduction Poland |publisher=[[United States Department of State]] |accessdate=2010-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Switzerland====
[[Switzerland]] has been frequently cited in the compliance reports as either a "Country of Concern," having "Enforcement Problems," or "Demonstrating Patterns of Noncompliance." In the 2010 report it was noted that: "delays in processing and enforcement often go on for weeks or months years{{clarify|date=January 2011}}, Swiss courts often treat Convention cases as custody decisions, invoking the child's “best interests” as a reason for denying return, and performing merits-based custody assessments, Swiss courts - up to and including Switzerland's highest court, often show bias toward the abducting parent, especially when the taking parent is the mother". High-level Swiss officials have defended this practice citing the “special relationship” between mothers and young children as influencing its decision to uphold the lower court's denial of the left-behind parent's application for return of an abducted child to the United States.  The report also observed that Swiss authorities are reluctant to actively enforce orders granting return to the United States or access to the child by the left-behind parent. Law enforcement has made only cursory efforts to locate taking parent and abducted children.{{clarify|is this according to the report?|date=January 2011}}

===Latin America===
[[File:Latin America (orthographic projection).svg|125px|left]]

According to the statistics in the [[US Department of State]]'s [[Hague Abduction Convention Compliance Reports|Compliance Reports]], as of 2010, 721 out of 1194, or 60%, of the children abducted from the United States to a Hague Convention partner were taken to [[Latin America]] with [[Mexico]] alone accounting for 474 or 40%.

The Child Abduction Convention entered into force between [[Brazil]] with the United States in 2003.  The US Department of State denoted Brazil as a country demonstrating "patterns of noncompliance" with the Hague Abduction Convention in 2008 and 2009.  In 2010 the status of Brazil's compliance was downgraded to that of "non-compliant." According to a 2009 [[New York Times]] report, there were at the time around fifty unsolved Convention cases for children abducted from the United States to Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;Semple, K (2009), ''Court Battle Over a Child Strains Ties in 2 Nations'', New York Times, 24 February 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The report states that Brazil has a history of non-compliance, and the Brazilian judiciary has a general inability to adjudicate a final and unappealable decision in Convention cases.

The subject of child abduction between the United States and Brazil received sustained media attention during 2009 and early 2010 as a result of the [[Goldman child abduction case]].  US Congress introduced H.R. 2702{{clarify|date=January 2011}}, legislation to suspend Brazil's [[Generalized System of Preferences]] trading benefit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h111-2702&amp;tab=summary|title=Suspend Brazil GSP Act (2009; 111th Congress H.R. 2702) - GovTrack.us|work=GovTrack.us}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case was also discussed on the US House of Representatives floor with a statement from Congressman [[Chris Smith (New Jersey politician)|Chris Smith]] (Republican, New Jersey), a staunch supporter of David Goldman, a New Jersey resident;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.govtrack.us/congress/record.xpd?id=111-h20090603-55 Rep Chrsi Smith: On Sean Goldman - Justice Delayed Again]{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. Secretary of State [[Hillary Clinton]] treated the case as a diplomatic issue of Brazil's obligations under the Hague Convention.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.gov/secretary/rm/2009a/12/134047.htm ''Return of Sean Goldman''] (Statement of Secretary of State Clinton, 2009-12-24)&lt;/ref&gt;  After nearly six years of litigation in Brazil, U.S. Senator [[Frank Lautenberg]] of [[New Jersey]] placed a hold on a trade bill which allows certain countries, including Brazil, to export certain products to the United States duty-free.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-5995670-503544.html | work=CBS News | first=Brian | last=Montopoli | title=David Goldman Custody Battle Leads to Block of Trade Bill | date=2009-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Days later, by a decision of [[Supreme Federal Court (Brazil)|Brazil's Supreme Court]], Sean was handed over to his father on December 24, 2009.

====Chile====
[[File:Coat of arms of Chile.svg|right|100px]]
[[Chile]] signed the [[Hague Abduction Convention]] in 1994 and it entered into force with the United States in the same year.  The [[US Department of State]] has denoted Chile as a country demonstrating "patterns of noncompliance" or a "not fully compliant" with the Hague Abduction Convention every year during the five period between 2005 and 2009 for its judicial Performance.  
Chilean courts delay Convention cases and often improperly treat them as [[child custody]] decisions, citing the [[UN Convention on the Rights of the Child]]. U.S. parents often experience bias by the courts in favor of Chilean parents, especially Chilean mothers. In addition, it is customary in Chilean courts to order psychological or social evaluations in all cases involving minor children, regardless of whether there is evidence of possible risk to the child in being returned to his or her country of habitual residence. Because the Hague Convention focuses on returning a child to his or her country of habitual residence, the United States [[Central Authority]] takes the view that psychological evaluations are unnecessary, and cause inappropriate delays in processing cases, if there is no evidence of risk to the child should the court order the child’s return.

Another trend is for Chilean courts to deny Convention applications upon finding that the child is well settled in the new environment. This result, which could be avoided if Chilean courts handled Convention cases more expeditiously, leaves the victim parent with the much less desirable option of filing an application under the Convention for mere access to the child, or for visitation, and even these applications in some cases have not resulted in contact between the left behind family and the child. In 2008, a Chilean court ordered a scheduled access visit by the LBP, and the left behind parent purchased and confirmed his plane ticket and accommodations for the trip. Hours before the parent was scheduled to board the plane for Chile, the Chilean Central Authority notified him that the Chilean judge had suspended the scheduled visitation.  In April 2008, the Chilean Central Authority sponsored a seminar on the Convention and its application in Chile, including topics such as the emotional impact of international child abduction on children and parents, and the role of “network judges” in promoting the correct application of the Convention in Chile.  Several months after the seminar, the Chilean Supreme Court designated a family court judge to serve as Chile’s network judge for Convention cases.

====Colombia====
[[File:Coat of arms of Colombia.svg|right|100px]]

The Hague Abduction Conventionentered into force in Colombia in 1996. According to the Convention Compliance Reports, Colombia ranks as one of the top ten destinations for the abduction of children from the United States. It has also been cited several times as a country demonstrating "patterns of noncompliance," being totally "noncompliant" and a "country of concern". In cases involving the Abduction Convention, recent legislation by the Colombian Congress has placed jurisdiction with the family courts. In remote areas of the country where there are no family courts, Hague Convention cases are heard by civil court circuit judges.  While Colombian courts can recognize or enforce U.S. custody orders, they generally refuse to do so and Colombian court orders prevail over foreign court orders.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}} Colombian courts favor parents of Colombian nationality and it is very rare for a court in Colombia to grant custody to a parent residing in the U.S. when there is a parent residing in Colombia.

International parental abduction is covered in the Colombian Penal Code as kidnapping, with circumstances that can increase or reduce the punishment. Colombia does not consider international parental kidnapping as an extraditable offense.

In contrast to United States requirements, a Colombian passport for a minor child can be obtained with only one parent's consent, though Colombia restricts the departure of Colombian children from the country when they are not in the company of both parents. Although this prevents misuse of a Colombian passport to abduct children from Colombia it facilitates abductions from countries like the United States who have no exit controls. If a parent wishes to prevent the issuance of a Colombian passport to their minor child, they  must submit a request to the Ministerio de la Proteccion Social, Instituto Colombiano de Bienestar Familiar (ICBF).  If the ICBF concurs with the parent's request, it will notify the Colombian passport office and Colombian Embassies and Consulates to place a hold on the issuance of a passport to the minor child.  Parents may only submit a request through ICBF, not through a Colombian Embassy or Consulate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.icbf.gov.co/icbf/directorio/portel/libreria/php/decide.php?patron=03 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-01-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120406085525/https://www.icbf.gov.co/icbf/directorio/portel/libreria/php/decide.php?patron=03 |archivedate=2012-04-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://travel.state.gov/abduction/country/country_3057.html |title=MIG: International Parental Child Abduction Colombia |publisher=[[United States Department of State]] |accessdate=2010-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Costa Rica====
[[File:Coat of arms of Costa Rica.svg|right|100px]]
Costa Rica has not ratified the Hague Abduction Convention and does not allow interstate enforcement of custody and visitation orders.&lt;!--would this be vice versa, i.e. the US not recognizing Costa rican court orders as well?--&gt; According to the US Department of state, Costa Rica is also well known to accept refugee applications from those mothers/fathers fleeing U.S. justice allowing abducting parents to claim some sort of legal problem with the US and seek asylum in Costa Rica.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ticotimes.com/costa-rica/child-abduction-custody-laws|title=Costa Rica, Child Custody and Abduction Laws |publisher=[[United States Department of State]] |accessdate=2010-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All children born in Costa Rica acquire Costa Rican citizenship at birth and, to prevent international child abduction, may only depart the country upon presentation of an exit permit issued by immigration authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/cis/cis_1093.html|title=Costa Rica Country Specific Information |publisher=ticotimes.com |accessdate=2010-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Dominican Republic====
[[File:Coat of arms of the Dominican Republic.svg|right|100px]]

In December 1997, the [[U.S. State Department]] targeted diplomatic entreaties at eight countries whose accession to the [[Hague Abduction Convention]] the Department judged would be most useful and effective to the United States, one of these was the [[Dominican Republic]].

The [[Dominican Republic]] signed and ratified the Abduction Convention in 2004 and it entered into force with the United States in 2007.  Since the treaty went into effect the Dominican Republic ranks in the top ten list of countries that are the source and destination of abducted children between the United States.

In their 2010 Compliance Report, the State Department added an outgoing child abduction case with the Dominican Republic to their new "Notable Cases" section.  They noted the Dominican Republic's Central authority evinced an "incorrect understanding of various articles of the Convention" and that requests for clarification from their Central Authority did not receive any substantive responses.

====Ecuador====
[[File:Coat of arms of Ecuador.svg|right|100px]]
The Hague Abduction Convention entered into force between [[Ecuador]] and the United States on March 1, 1992. Over the years Ecuador has been cited in a number of Compliance Reports as a "noncompliant" country or a country demonstrating a "pattern of noncompliance."  In the year period covered by the 2010 Report there were 24 children abducted from the U.S. to Ecuador and 7 children abducted from Ecuador to the U.S.

Ecuador has demonstrated noncompliance both in its judicial performance and its [[Central Authority]] performance. Convention case hearings are excessively delayed, in violation of the Convention’s principle of
promptly returning children to their habitual country of residence. In addition, courts treat cases as custody decisions, rather than a determination of the appropriate jurisdiction to decide custody.  Having delayed proceedings themselves, the courts of Ecuador have been known to determine that, due to the delay, children have resettled in their new environment.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

Efforts of the United States to communicate about cases with the Ecuadorian Central Authority (ECA) for the Abduction Convention have not been effective with ECA consistently being unresponsive to the US Central Authority's (USCA) requests for case updates and copies of court rulings. The USCA is not aware of any efforts by the ECA to train judges about the Convention.&lt;!--is that a requirement under the convention? if so, it adds to the strength of the point to add it--&gt;&lt;ref name="2008 Compliance Report"/&gt;

====Honduras====
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2011}}
[[File:Coat of arms of Honduras.svg|right|100px]]
The Hague Abduction Convention entered into force between [[Honduras]] and the United States in 1994.  Honduras is the only country to be listed in every singled Compliance Report as non-compliant since the reports began in 1999. The implementation of the Hague Convention in Honduras is broken on every level. It has an executive branch and legislature that is, at various times, unsure if it has actually signed the Convention. Its [[Central Authority]] sometimes does not exist at all{{clarify|date=January 2011}} and when it is reestablished does not fulfill any of its roles and is chronically understaffed.  The judiciary demonstrates a complete lack of understanding of the treaty and, even in the rare case that a return order is issued, it is not enforced.

In 11 years of reporting on Convention compliance in Honduras there has not been a single case where a return was judicially ordered and enforced.  Like with Mexico, would be abductors of children to Honduras can legally{{dubious|date=January 2011}} take children across the southern land border without the permission of the other parent or even a passport.

The [[Hague Abduction Convention]] entered into force between [[Mexico]] and the United States in 1991.&lt;ref name="Hcch.net"/&gt; Mexico is the number one destination for international child abductions from the United States and the United States is the number one destination for children abducted from Mexico. The [[U.S. State Department]] reports that 65% of all outgoing international parental abductions from the United States to Hague Convention countries are to Mexico, and that 41% of all incoming international parental abductions to the United States are from Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.missingkids.com/missingkids/servlet/NewsEventServlet?LanguageCountry=en_US&amp;PageId=4109|title=SPEECH OF Ernie Allen President &amp; CEO National Center for Missing &amp; Exploited Children International Centre for Missing &amp; Exploited Children Child Abductions: Globally, Nationally and Along the US/Mexico Border|publisher=Missingkids.com|date=2009-08-31|accessdate=2010-04-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101224040247/http://www.missingkids.com/missingkids/servlet/NewsEventServlet?LanguageCountry=en_US&amp;PageId=4109#|archive-date=2010-12-24|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mexico is the only country that has been found to be "Noncompliant, "Not Fully Compliant" or having a "Pattern of Noncompliance" in every single [[United States Hague Abduction Convention Compliance Reports|Compliance Report]] compiled by the [[US Department of State]] since they began in 2001.

One of the primary roadblocks to Mexico's successful implementation of the Hague Abduction Convention is its inability to locate children.  This issue has been cited numerous times in the US State Department's annual Compliance Reports. In some cases, the US State Department has reported providing Mexican authorities with detailed information on the whereabouts of abducted children including the exact address where they are living but Mexican authorities still report an inability to locate the children. In late 2009 the Mexican Central Authority gave a presentation at an international symposium on international child abduction where they cited improvements in this area as a result of turning over the responsibility of locating children to the Mexican Federal Police (AFI), rather than exclusively using Interpol who has no authority and must request the involvement of Mexican law enforcement to take any real measures in Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.auswaertiges-amt.de/diplo/de/Aussenpolitik/InternatRecht/Downloads/RedeLopez.pdf |title=THE EXPERIENCE OF MEXICO ON INTERNATIONAL CHILD ABDUCTION |author=Reyna Aurora Martínez López |accessdate=2010-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of particular relevance to Hague Convention litigation in Mexico is the Mexican [[Amparo (law)|Amparo]], which translates to "protection" or "help." It is a Mexican legal procedure to protect constitutional rights that was incorporated into the 1847 national constitution.&lt;ref&gt;Acta de Reformas, art. 25 (1847) (amending Constitution of 1824).&lt;/ref&gt;  Mexico's "''recurso de amparo''" is found in Articles 103 and 107 of the [[Mexican Constitution]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://services.inquirer.net/express/07/09/03/html_output/xmlhtml/20070903-86232-xml.html The Mexican amparo] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101015062605/http://services.inquirer.net/express/07/09/03/html_output/xmlhtml/20070903-86232-xml.html |date=2010-10-15 }}, Joaquin G. Bernas, Inquirer.net. Accessed 20-06-09&lt;/ref&gt; Any Mexican citizen can file an amparo claiming that a Mexican authority is violating their constitutional rights.  Federal District courts are available in every state in Mexico and always have secretaries available to receive an Amparo.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}  In cases of international child abduction an amparo can be filed at any point and effectively blocks progression of legal procedures until it has been heard, often many months, or even years later. The decision in an Amparo trial can also be further appealed and multiple amparos may be filed during legal proceedings under the Hague Convention.

Corruption is an intrinsic part of the problem with international child abduction in Mexico and affects every other aspect of the issue from locating children and judicial decisions to enforcing court orders for repatriation in the rare cases where the obstacles of locating children and judicial noncompliance have been overcome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lasvegastribune.com//index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=683:judge-steel-opens-door |title=Judge Steel Opens the Door for Abduction |publisher=Las Vegas Tribune |date=2010-03-30  |accessdate=2010-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is an Extradition Treaty between the United States of America and the United Mexican States (see 31 U.S.T. 5061) that, like many such treaties, provides for the extradition of a party who has been charged with or found guilty of an offense committed in one country. An offense is extraditable if it is a crime in both countries and punishable by incarceration for a period of one year or more. In theory this allows for the extradition of child abductors who have absconded to Mexico as child abduction is a federal crime there. In practice, US authorities rarely request extradition in preference of Hague Convention litigation, despite Mexico's gross noncompliance with the Convention and, even when they do, Mexico is not bound to deliver up its nationals and will frequently refuse to do so across the board, particularly in child abduction cases.

Additionally [[U.S.–Mexico border]] has the highest number of both legal and illegal crossings of any land border in the world.  Although the border is guarded on the United States' side by more than seventeen thousand border patrol agents, they only have "effective control" of less than 700 miles of the 1,954 mile border.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Terence P. |last=Jeffrey |authorlink= |title=Administration Will Cut Border Patrol Deployed on U.S-Mexico Border |url=http://www.cnsnews.com/news/article/54514 |newspaper= |publisher=Cybercast News Service |date=24 September 2009 |accessdate=25 September 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091209091814/http://www.cnsnews.com/news/article/54514 |archivedate=9 December 2009 |df= }} and&lt;br/&gt;{{cite news|first=Jonathon |last=Shacat |authorlink= |title=Fewer border agents in south |url=http://www.svherald.com/articles/2009/09/25/news/doc4abc7145ddcf8256922136.txt |newspaper= |publisher=The Sierra Vista Herald |date=25 September 2009 |accessdate=25 September 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In terms of international child abduction from the US into Mexico specifically, the problem of poor border security in general is compounded by the fact the United States does not have exit controls;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://travel.state.gov/family/abduction/prevention/prevention_560.html |title=US State Department: Child Abduction Prevention |publisher=Travel.state.gov |date= |accessdate=2010-04-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100408015216/http://travel.state.gov/family/abduction/prevention/prevention_560.html |archivedate=2010-04-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; American children may be taken across the southern border of the United States without having the necessary documentation to get back into the country and there is no accounting for children taken across the border into Mexico, leading to thousands of missing children posters with the words "may have traveled to Mexico" on them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/search?q=missing+"may+have+traveled+to+Mexico"|title=missing "may have traveled to Mexico" - Google Search|work=google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Panama====
[[File:Coat of Arms of Panama.svg|right|100px]]
Panama’s performance in implementing the Convention was previously cited as “non-compliant”.  However, progress has been noted in Panama’s handling of its Convention responsibilities during the 2005 reporting period and the United States presently considers Panama to be “not fully compliant” in its implementation of the Convention.  
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://travel.state.gov/abduction/hague_issues/hague_issues_2952.html |title=2006 Compliance Report |publisher=Travel.state.gov |date= |accessdate=2010-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Venezuela====
The Hague Abduction Convention entered into force between [[Venezuela]] and the United States at the start of 1997. According to the compliance Reports, Venezuela was cited as a country "non-compliant" with the Hague Convention in 2006 and as demonstrating "patterns of noncompliance" in 2008 and 2009. The Venezuelan [[Central Authority]] typically failed to be responsive to inquiries regarding abduction cases by the [[United States Department of State]], the US Embassy in Caracas, or victimized parents. Venezuelan judges often misinterpret return and access applications under the Convention as a request for them to determine custody or visitation rights and have been  observed to have a nationalistic bias in favor of the Venezuelan parent.

In addition, despite return orders issued by lower courts, the abducting parents can and do take advantage of prolonged appeals processes to significantly delay the return of children. These delays are particularly pronounced in cases in which the left-behind parent can not afford to retain a private attorney.  Without the use of a private attorney, cases take very long.

==United States Government handling of abduction cases==

The United States government generally, and the [[U.S. Department of State]] specifically, have been subject to sustained criticism for not doing enough to prevent the abduction of American children or support American parents of internationally abducted children in their recovery efforts.&lt;ref name="HalfTruth"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.uoregon.edu/faculty/mweiner/docs/halftruth.pdf |title=HALF-TRUTHS, MISTAKES, AND EMBARRASSMENTS: THE UNITED STATES GOES TO THE FIFTH MEETING OF THE SPECIAL COMMISSION TO REVIEW THE OPERATION OF THE HAGUE CONVENTION ON THE CIVIL ASPECTS OF INTERNATIONAL CHILD ABDUCTION |publisher=Utah Law Review |author=Merle H. Weiner |year=2007 |accessdate=2010-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They have also been criticized for, conversely, catering to foreign countries and parents with abducted children taken to the United States, and not doing enough to facilitate the recovery efforts of foreign parents.&lt;ref name="HalfTruth"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GlassHouse"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.internationalfamilylawfirm.com/2009/11/people-in-glass-houses.html |title=People in Glass Houses … Does the U.S. comply with the Hague Abduction Convention? |publisher=internationalfamilylawfirm.com |author=Jeremy D.

===United States Department of State===
{{further|Office of Children's Issues}}

American parents complain that they are essentially alone in dealing with foreign courts and legal systems.  The US State Department has a virtual monopoly on information in such cases, but refuses to act as a vigorous advocate for left-behind American parents while also preventing the [[National Center for Missing and Exploited Children]] or anyone else from playing that role. State Department attorney Thomas Johnson remarked that when he reminded one senior State Department official with Child Abduction Convention responsibilities that she works for the American people, her immediate response was: "I don’t work for the American people; I work for the Secretary of State",  demonstrating the Department’s inherent conflict of interest (i.e., a desire to maintain "good" bilateral foreign relations for their own sake that overrides assertive and effective advocacy on behalf of American citizens).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.findthekids.org/pdf/johnson.pdf |title=THE HAGUE CHILD ABDUCTION CONVENTION: DIMINISHING RETURNS AND LITTLE TO CELEBRATE FOR AMERICANS |publisher=NYU Journal of International Law and Politics, 33 N.Y.U. J. Int ' l L. &amp; Pol. 125 |year=2000 |accessdate=2010-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Dangerous Diplomacy ====

The journalist [[Joel Mowbray]] wrote the book "Dangerous Diplomacy" on the role and culture of the US State Department.  Mowbray's second chapter in "Dangerous Diplomacy", titled "Cold Shoulder: State's Smallest Victim's", is dedicated to an analysis of the assistance provided to American parents left in the wake of an international child abduction.  It describes State's overriding desire to appease foreign governments and maintain "good relations" as having a conflict of interest between their responsibility to internationally abducted children as the designated United States Central Authority under the Hague Convention.  This inherent conflict of interest between the two roles is magnified by what the book defines as the "culture of State", a culture characterized by extreme moral relativism, valuing process over substance and misplaced priorities that reward failures by promotions or high paying jobs "consulting" for the foreign government of the country that they'd previously been paid to advocate America's interests in.&lt;ref name="dangerous"&gt;{{cite book |title=Dangerous Diplomacy |author=Joel Mowbray |ISBN=0-89526-110-3|year=2003 |publisher=Regnery}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Extracts from Congressional testimony====

;[[Bernard W. Aronson]], Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs (1989–1993)&lt;ref name="TLC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bringseanhome.org/Bernard_Aronson_testimony.pdf |title=Statement of the Honorable Bernard Aronson, Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs (1989-1993) |publisher=Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission |date=2009-12-02 |accessdate=2010-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"..the current system to secure the return of these abducted American children does not work and will not work unless it is changed profoundly.  I don't doubt the sincerity or the dedication of the professionals in the State Department who have lead responsibility for this problem, but they do not have the tools and powers to do their job effectively.  And unless Congress gives them the power and the tools we will be back here in five years or 10 years with another set of hearings, another group of parents with broken hearts and devastated dreams, and we will be making the same statements we are making today."

"the principal reason other nations, whether they are signatories to the Hague Convention or not, refuse to cooperate with the United States in returning abducted American children is that there are no real consequences for failing to do so."

"Let me be blunt, a diplomatic request for which there are no consequences for refusal is just a sophisticated version of begging.  And there are no consequences today for Brazil or any other nation which refuses to return American children."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5876">The '''[[Interregnum]] of World Chess Champions''' was the period between March 24, 1946 (the date of [[Alexander Alekhine]]'s death) and May 17, 1948 (when [[Mikhail Botvinnik]] won [[World Chess Championship 1948|a special championship tournament]]).

==History==
When Alekhine suddenly died in 1946, the title of World Chess Champion became vacant for the first time in its 60-year history. Since the 19th century, the title was decided by [[List of chess world championship matches|matches]] between the current champion and a challenger, who by winning would become the new champion. Alekhine died holding the title, leaving no obvious method for a new player to succeed him.

The situation was very confused, with many respected players and commentators offering different solutions, for example: [[Max Euwe]] should be declared champion because he was the last player to win a championship match; [[Mikhail Botvinnik]] should be declared champion because Alekhine had accepted a challenge from Botvinnik before his death; or Euwe should play a match for the title against Botvinnik. [[FIDE]], the international chess federation, found it very difficult to organize the early discussions on how to resolve the ''interregnum'' because problems with money and travel so soon after the end of [[World War II]] prevented many countries from sending representatives – most notably the [[Soviet Union]]. The shortage of clear information resulted in otherwise responsible magazines publishing rumors and speculation, which only made the situation more confused.&lt;ref name="Winter2003Interregnum" /&gt;

FIDE's discussions mainly favored: A [[round-robin tournament|round-robin]] tournament involving the world's top players, to determine who would be the new World Champion (their first proposal in July 1946 nominated Euwe, Botvinnik, [[Paul Keres]], [[Vasily Smyslov]], [[Reuben Fine]], [[Samuel Reshevsky]] and one of the winners of the [[Groningen (city)|Groningen]] and [[Prague]] tournaments to be held later in 1946).   (Most of these were participants in the [[AVRO 1938 chess tournament|1938 AVRO tournament]].)  Afterwards, a match for the title every 3 years after that, the challenger being selected by a series of tournaments.&lt;ref name="Winter2003Interregnum"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; But some writers suggest that at the 1947 FIDE congress, Euwe was declared World Champion on a vote that took place just before the Soviet Union's delegates arrived, and the Soviet Union immediately supported the proposal for a World Championship Tournament – so Euwe was deposed after a two-hour "reign" as World Champion.&lt;ref name="Münninghoff2001EuweBiography"&gt;{{cite book

The [[World Chess Championship 1948|World Championship Tournament]] took place in 1948, the first half in [[The Hague]] and the second in Moscow. Botvinnik won by scoring 14 points out of 20 and making a plus score against each of the other players; in fact he clinched first place some days before the last round ended on 
May 17, 1948.&lt;ref name="chessgamesWorldChampionshipTournament1948"&gt;{{cite web
 | url=http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chesscollection?cid=1006692
 | title=World Championship Tournament 1948
 | publisher=chessgames.com
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus he became the new world champion and brought the ''interregnum'' to an end. Competitions for the World Chess Championship would be held exclusively under FIDE's auspices for the next 45 years.

The Interregnum was a unique period in modern chess history. Although there were gaps in the chain of succession of the title when a new champion did not play against the old one (e.g. [[Anatoly Karpov]] after [[Bobby Fischer]]), the Interregnum currently remains the only period in the history of modern chess in which there was no World Champion.

==Women==
There was a similar interregnum of the Women's World Chess Championship, between [[Vera Menchik|Vera Menchik's]] death in 1944 and [[Lyudmila Rudenko]] winning the championship in 1950.

__NOTOC__
[[Judicial review]], under which executive actions of the Government are subject to review, and possible invalidation, is used in [[New Zealand]]. Judicial review is carried out by a judge of the [[High Court of New Zealand]].  Legislative action is not justiciable in the High Court under New Zealand's Westminster constitutional arrangements; Parliament remains supreme in law.

The [[Judicature Act 1908]] and its amendments, especially the Judicature Amendment Act 1972, govern the process of judicial review.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nzlawyermagazine.co.nz/Archives/Issue100/N7/tabid/1398/Default.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-08-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120318144609/http://www.nzlawyermagazine.co.nz/Archives/Issue100/N7/tabid/1398/Default.aspx |archivedate=18 March 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Part 1 of that the Judicature Amendment Act 1972 was re-enacted by Parliament via the [http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/2016/0050/latest/whole.html Judicial Review Procedure Act 2016.]

It states in Section 3:
'3 Purpose of this Act
(1) The purpose of this Act is to re-enact Part 1 of the Judicature Amendment Act 1972, which sets out procedural provisions for the judicial review of—
(a) the exercise of a statutory power:
(b) the failure to exercise a statutory power:
(c) the proposed or purported exercise of a statutory power.
(2) The reorganisation in this Act of those provisions, and the changes made to their style and language, are not intended to alter the interpretation or effect of those provisions as they appeared in the Judicature Amendment Act 1972.'

The '''Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2016''' is an [[Act of the Scottish Parliament]] which continues the process of [[land reform in Scotland]] following the [[Community Empowerment (Scotland) Act 2015]]. It is notable for granting [[Scottish ministers]] the power to force the sale of private land to community bodies to further [[sustainable development]] in the absence of a willing seller.

==Provisions==

Under the provisions of the act there is to be a ‘Land Rights and Responsibilities Statement’, setting out the Scottish Government’s objectives for [[Land reform in Scotland|land reform]], a [[Scottish Land Commission]] is to take forward the land reform process, preparing a strategic plan, for the approval of Scottish ministers. One of the new land commissioners is to be a Tenant Farming Commissioner who must be neither an agricultural landlord nor a tenant but who is to be responsible for reviewing issues relating to [[tenant farming]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Blair|first1=Mike|title=A Brief Guide to Land Reform in Scotland|url=http://www.gillespiemacandrew.co.uk/media/340813/land-reform-act-2016.pdf|publisher=Gillespie Macandrew LLP|accessdate=5 March 2017|date=April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A further provision is the creation of the Community Right to Buy for Sustainable Development. This permits Scottish ministers to approve the purchase of privately owned land by a community body with a registered interest. Unlike the Community Right to Buy established by the [[Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003]] and extended by the [[Community Empowerment (Scotland) Act 2015]], the Community Right to Buy for Sustainable Development does not require a willing seller but allows ministers to compel landowners to sell if they decide that the sale will further sustainable development in the area. In this respect it is similar to the Crofting Community Right to Buy of the 2003 Act which allows [[crofting]] communities to purchase croft land and the Community Right to Buy abandoned or derelict land of the 2015 Act, neither of which require a willing seller.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Community rights to buy in Scotland – which is which, and what are they for?|url=http://www.brodies.com/node/8185|website=Brodies|accessdate=5 March 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Community bodies may also register an interest in allowing a 3rd party to purchase land on the same basis. 

Other provisions of the act include new regulations to require persons who control land to be identified, with information obtained to appear in the Land Register of Scotland; the removal of sporting rights exemption from rates, which are to be re-valued; and further powers for [[Scottish Natural Heritage]] to control deer management. It also makes provision for notice and consultation where core paths are to be amended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2016|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/asp/2016/18/pdfs/asp_20160018_en.pdf|accessdate=5 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The coffee that patrons bought at the [[drive-through]], it turns out, was heated to be much hotter than the coffee they served inside was. The jury found the conduct of McDonald's so objectionable that they not only awarded her compensatory damages, but awarded the woman millions of dollars in punitive damages.

'''Orion Pictures Corporation''' is an American [[List of film production companies|motion picture producer]] and [[Film distributor|distributor]] that produced and released films from 1978 until 1999 and was also involved in television production and syndication throughout the 1980s until the early 1990s. It was formed in 1978 as a [[joint venture]] between [[Warner Bros.]] and three former top-level executives of [[United Artists]]. Although it was never a large motion picture producer, Orion achieved a comparatively high reputation for [[Hollywood]] quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Whither Orion? : The Last of the Mini-Major Studios Finds Itself at a Crossroads|publisher= [[The Los Angeles Times]]|date=1990-07-19|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1990-07-19/entertainment/ca-363_1_studio-executives|accessdate=2010-12-28|first=Nina J.|last=Easton}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Woody Allen]], [[James Cameron]], [[Jonathan Demme]], [[Oliver Stone]], and several other prominent directors worked with Orion during its most successful years from 1978 to 1992. Of the films distributed by Orion, four won [[Academy Award]]s for [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]]: ''[[Amadeus (film)|Amadeus]]'' (1984), ''[[Platoon (film)|Platoon]]'' (1986), ''[[Dances with Wolves]]'' (1990), and ''[[The Silence of the Lambs (film)|The Silence of the Lambs]]'' (1991).&lt;ref name="variety" /&gt;  Two other Orion films, ''[[Hannah and Her Sisters]]'' (1986) and ''[[Mississippi Burning]]'' (1988), were nominated for that same category.

In 2013, [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] revived the Orion name for television; a year later, Orion Pictures was relaunched by the studio.

==History==

===Beginnings: 1978–1981===
In January 1978, three executives of [[Transamerica Corporation|Transamerica]] (TA)-owned studio [[United Artists]] (UA) – [[Arthur B. Krim]] (chairman), [[Eric Pleskow]] (president and chief executive officer), and [[Robert S. Benjamin]] (chairman of the finance committee) - quit their jobs. Krim and Benjamin had headed UA since 1951, and subsequently turned around the then-flailing studio with a number of critical and commercial successes. Change had begun once Transamerica purchased UA in 1967, and within a decade a rift formed between Krim and TA chairman Jack Beckett regarding the studio's operations. Krim suggested spinning off United Artists into a separate company, which was rejected by Beckett.&lt;ref name="may"&gt;Medavoy and Young, pp. 83-90&lt;/ref&gt;

The last straw came for Pleskow when he refused to collect and deliver the medical records of UA department heads to Transamerica's offices in San Francisco for the sake of confidentiality. The tensions only worsened when ''Fortune'' magazine reported an article on the clash between UA and TA, in which Beckett had stated that if the executives disliked the parent company's treatment of them, they should resign.&lt;ref name="may" /&gt; Krim, Benjamin, and Pleskow quit United Artists on January 13, 1978, followed by the exits of senior vice presidents William Bernstein and [[Mike Medavoy]] three days later. The week following the resignations, according to the website ''Reference for Business'', "63 important Hollywood figures took out an advertisement in a trade paper warning UA that it had made a fatal mistake in letting the five men leave. The 'fatal mistake' came true following the box office disaster of ''[[Heaven's Gate (film)|Heaven's Gate]]''"&lt;ref name="RFB"&gt;[http://www.referenceforbusiness.com/history2/48/ORION-PICTURES-CORPORATION.html "Orion Pictures Corporation."] ''Reference for Business''&lt;/ref&gt; which led to Transamerica selling UA to [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Champlin |first1=Charles |title=That's a Wrap: End of MGM/UA That Was |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-11-20/entertainment/ca-5110_1_mgm-lot |accessdate=2013-08-16 |work=Los Angeles Times |date=November 20, 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1978, the five men forged a deal with [[Warner Bros.]] The executives formed Orion Pictures Company, named after [[Orion (constellation)|the constellation]], which they claimed had five main stars (it actually has seven/eight). The new company intended only to finance projects, giving the filmmakers complete creative autonomy; this ideal was implemented with great success at United Artists.  Orion held a $100 million line of credit, and its films would be distributed by the [[Warner Bros.]] studio. Orion, however, was contractually given free rein over distribution and advertising, as well as the number and type of films the executives chose to invest in.&lt;ref&gt;Medavoy and Young, pp. 95-97&lt;/ref&gt;

In late March 1978, Orion signed its first contract; a two-picture deal with [[John Travolta]]'s production company. Contracts with actress and director [[Barbra Streisand]]; actors [[James Caan (actor)|James Caan]], [[Jane Fonda]], [[Peter Sellers]], [[Jon Voight]], and [[Burt Reynolds]]; directors [[Francis Ford Coppola]] and [[Blake Edwards]]; writer/director [[John Milius]]; singer [[Peter Frampton]]; and producer [[Ray Stark]] soon materialized.&lt;ref name="RFB" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press. [https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=HbssAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=LxMEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4846,4749317&amp;dq=orion+pictures&amp;hl=en "Top Stars Join Orion Pictures"] ''Wilmington Morning Star'' (November 22, 1978; page 10-A). Retrieved November 2, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Orion also developed a co-financing and distribution deal with [[EMI Films]].&lt;ref name="RFB" /&gt; In its first year, Orion had 15 films into productions plus were in production, and had a dozen more actors, directors and producers line up to sign up with Orion.&lt;ref name="RFB" /&gt;

In 1979, Benjamin died. Orion's first film, ''[[A Little Romance]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Medavoy and Young, p. 104&lt;/ref&gt; was released in April that year. That year, Orion released [[Blake Edwards]]' ''[[10 (film)|10]]'', which became a big critical and commercial success; the first for Edwards in over a decade (aside from installments of ''[[The Pink Panther (film series)|The Pink Panther]]'' franchise). Other films released in that period included ''[[Caddyshack]]''; ''[[The Great Santini]]'', a critically praised but underpromoted adaptation of a [[Pat Conroy]] novel; and ''[[Promises in the Dark (film)|Promises in the Dark]]''. Out of the 23 films Orion released between April 1979 and December 1981, only a third of them made a profit.&lt;ref&gt;Medavoy and Young, p. 115&lt;/ref&gt; Orion executives were conflicted over financing big-budgeted films and passed on ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'' for that reason.&lt;ref&gt;Medavoy and Young, p. 114-115&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acquisition of Filmways: 1981–1983===
By early 1982, Orion had severed its distribution ties with Warner. As part of the deal, the rights to Orion's films made up to that point were sold to Warner. Orion was now looking to have its own distribution network by acquiring another company with such capabilities. The four partners looked into [[Monogram Pictures|Allied Artists]] and [[Embassy Pictures]]&lt;ref&gt;Medavoy and Young, p. 122&lt;/ref&gt; before settling on [[Filmways]].&lt;ref name=aic&gt;{{cite book|last=Tzioumakis|first=Yannis|title=AMERICAN INDEPENDENT CINEMA|year=2006|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|location=Edinburgh|pages=228–229}}&lt;/ref&gt; Orion subsequently purchased Filmways and reorganized the flailing company. New employees were hired and all of Filmways' non-entertainment assets ([[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]] and [[Broadcast Electronics]]) were sold off.&lt;ref name="RFB" /&gt;&lt;ref name=aic/&gt; On August 31, 1982, Filmways was renamed as Orion Pictures Corporation.

Another result of the merger was that Orion entered television production. Orion's biggest TV hit was ''[[Cagney &amp; Lacey]]'', which lasted seven seasons on CBS. In 1983, Orion Pictures introduced art-house division [[Orion Classics]] with executives who had previously run [[United Artists|United Artists Classics]].&lt;ref name=aic/&gt;

===Problems arise: 1984–1986===
According to ''Reference for Business'': "Of the first 18 movies the company had released as Orion Pictures Corporation, ten had been profitable, five had broken even, and three had losses of less than $2 million."&lt;ref name="RFB" /&gt; One such film, [[Francis Ford Coppola]]'s ''[[The Cotton Club (film)|The Cotton Club]]'', was mired in legal troubles and Orion lost $3 million of its investment.&lt;ref name="RFB" /&gt; '"We've had some singles and doubles [but haven't] had any home runs," lamented Krim.&lt;ref name="RFB" /&gt; In September 1984, Orion distributed ''[[Amadeus (film)|Amadeus]]'', which garnered many accolades, winning eight [[Academy Awards]], including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]].&lt;ref name="RFB" /&gt;

For Orion, 1985 was a dismal year. All but two films, ''[[Desperately Seeking Susan]]'' and ''[[Code of Silence (film)|Code of Silence]]'', made less than $10 million in the United States box office, including an unsuccessful attempt at a [[James Bond]]-type franchise, ''[[Remo Williams: The Adventure Begins]]''.&lt;ref name="RFB" /&gt; Orion's haphazard distribution channels and unsuccessful advertising campaigns made it impossible to achieve a hit. Another factor was that Orion was about to venture into the video business and stopped selling off home use rights to its films. Furthermore, production of the [[Rodney Dangerfield]] comedy ''[[Back to School]]'' was put on hold when a co-producer died, taking the film off of its Christmas 1985 release slate.&lt;ref name="nyc"&gt;Kornbluth, Jesse (April 6, 1987). ''The Little Studio that Could'' (pp. 48-54). ''[[New York Magazine]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1986, [[Mario Kassar]] and [[Andrew Vajna]], producers of the ''[[Rambo (film series)|Rambo]]'' films (the first film, ''[[First Blood (film)|First Blood]]'', was distributed by Orion) attempted to buy $55 million worth of the studio's stock through the duo's company, [[Carolco Pictures|Anabasis]]. Had they succeeded, Kassar and Vajna would have controlled the board and laid off every executive save for Krim.&lt;ref name="nyc" /&gt; Warburg Pincus subsequently limited its 20% stake in Orion to 5%; the remaining stocks were acquired by [[Viacom (original)|Viacom International]].&lt;ref name="RFB" /&gt; Viacom hoped to use Orion's product for its pay-TV channel [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]].&lt;ref&gt;Medavoy and Young, p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt; Orion expanded into home video distribution with the formation of Orion Home Entertainment Corporation.&lt;ref name="RFB" /&gt;

===Metromedia era: 1986–1991===
On May 22, 1986, [[Metromedia]], a television and communications company controlled by billionaire (and a friend of Krim's) [[John Kluge]], which had just divested of its television station group to [[Rupert Murdoch]]'s [[News Corporation]] (which would form what is now the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox network]]), purchased a 6.5% stake in Orion. Kluge's investment in the company came at the right time- ''Back to School'' was a success and ultimately earned $90 million at the box office.&lt;ref name="RFB" /&gt; By March 1987, the studio's fortunes increased dramatically with a succession of critical and commercial hits, including ''[[Platoon (film)|Platoon]]'' (which ultimately won a Best Picture Oscar), Woody Allen's ''[[Hannah and Her Sisters]]'', and the sports film ''[[Hoosiers (film)|Hoosiers]]''. Orion's 1986 offerings totaled 18 Academy Award nominations, more than any other studio.&lt;ref name="RFB" /&gt; In 1987, Orion achieved further success with ''[[RoboCop]]'', and ''[[No Way Out (1987 film)|No Way Out]]''.&lt;ref name="RFB" /&gt; By this time, Orion's television division had expanded into the lucrative syndicated game show market under the name ''Century Towers Productions'', in reference to Orion's street address at the time. It produced revivals of format inherited from [[Heatter-Quigley Productions]] after the Filmways merger (as Filmways had previously acquired HQ in the late 1960s); this included ''[[Hollywood Squares|The New Hollywood Squares]]'', which ran from 1986 to 1989, and a revival of ''[[High Rollers]]'' which aired in the 1987-88 season.

In January 1987, Kluge faced big competition with the arrival of [[Sumner Redstone]]. His theater chain, [[National Amusements]], purchased 6.42 percent of the company's stock. National Amusements later acquired Viacom, increasing their Orion stake at 21%, then 26%. Soon Kluge started buying more Orion stock, leading to him and Redstone battling it out to take over the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= COMPANY NEWS; Orion Pictures Stake Increased|work= The New York Times|date=1987-12-17|url= https://www.nytimes.com/1987/12/17/business/company-news-orion-pictures-stake-increased.html?scp=1&amp;sq=Orion%20Pictures&amp;st=cse|accessdate=2010-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= A 6.5% Stake In Orion Pictures|work= The New York Times|date=1986-06-03|url= https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/03/business/a-6.5-stake-in-orion-pictures.html?scp=7&amp;sq=Orion%20Pictures&amp;st=cse|accessdate=2010-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kluge ultimately succeeded when Metromedia took over approximately 67% of Orion on May 20, 1988, effectively giving him control of the studio.&lt;ref name="RFB" /&gt; One analyst commented on the takeover to the ''Wall Street Journal'': "This amount is probably so small to Kluge it doesn't matter. He probably burns that up in a weekend."&lt;ref name="RFB" /&gt;

In 1989, Orion suffered from a disastrous slate of films, placing themselves dead last among the major Hollywood studios in terms of box office revenue. Among its biggest flops that year were ''[[Great Balls of Fire! (film)|Great Balls of Fire!]]'', the biography of [[Jerry Lee Lewis]] starring [[Dennis Quaid]] and [[Winona Ryder]]; ''[[She-Devil (film)|She-Devil]]'', a dark comedy starring [[Meryl Streep]] and [[Roseanne Barr]]; and [[Miloš Forman]]'s adaptation of ''[[Les Liaisons dangereuses]]'', ''[[Valmont (film)|Valmont]]'', which competed with ''[[Dangerous Liaisons]]'', also based on the same source material. Test screenings of the [["Weird Al" Yankovic]] comedy ''[[UHF (film)|UHF]]'' were so strong that Orion had high expectations for it. It flopped at first,&lt;ref name="RFB" /&gt; but it has since attained a strong cult following.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media notes

In February 1990, Orion signed a deal with [[Columbia Pictures|Columbia Pictures Entertainment]] in which the much larger studio would pay Orion $175 million to distribute Orion's movies and television programs overseas. Orion had previously licensed its films to individual distributors territory by territory.&lt;ref name="RFB" /&gt; That same month, Mike Medavoy left Orion and became head of [[Tri-Star Pictures]].&lt;ref&gt;Medavoy and Young, p. 201&lt;/ref&gt;

1990 was just as dismal for Orion as the year prior, with such failures as ''[[The Hot Spot]]'' and ''[[State of Grace (1990 film)|State of Grace]]''. The only bright spot that year was [[Kevin Costner]]'s western epic ''[[Dances with Wolves]]''. It won seven Academy Awards, including Best Picture,&lt;ref name="wb"&gt;{{cite news|title= BUSINESS PEOPLE; Chief at Orion Pictures Is Joining Paramount|work= The New York Times|date=1992-02-21|url= https://www.nytimes.com/1992/02/21/business/business-people-chief-at-orion-pictures-is-joining-paramount.html?scp=4&amp;sq=Orion%20Pictures&amp;st=cse|accessdate=2010-08-08 | first=Anthony | last=Ramirez}}&lt;/ref&gt; and grossed $400 million worldwide. A few months later, Orion garnered another winner with ''[[The Silence of the Lambs (film)|The Silence of the Lambs]]'', but these two films could not make up for years of losses. Only Kluge's continued infusions of cash were enough to keep the company afloat, but soon he had enough.

===Bankruptcy: 1991–1995===
After failing to sell Orion to businessman (and former 20th Century Fox owner) [[Marvin Davis]] ([[Sony]], which had recently purchased [[Columbia Pictures]] was also interested&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= COMPANY NEWS; Orion Pictures' Stock Increases|work= The New York Times|date=1991-02-09|url= https://www.nytimes.com/1991/02/09/business/company-news-orion-pictures-stock-increases.html?scp=5&amp;sq=Orion%20Pictures&amp;st=cse|accessdate=2010-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;), Kluge took drastic steps. First, Orion shut down production. Second, Kluge ordered the sale of several projects, such as ''[[The Addams Family (1991 film)|The Addams Family]]'' (which went to [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]], though the international rights to the film were retained by Orion), in order to accumulate much-needed cash. Finally, in the spring of 1991, Kluge's people took over the company, leading to the departure of Arthur Krim.&lt;ref&gt;Medavoy and Young, pp. 202-203.&lt;/ref&gt; Orion's financial problems were so severe, that at the 63rd Annual Academy Awards in March 1991, host [[Billy Crystal]] made reference to the studio's debt in his opening monologue, joking that "''[[Reversal of Fortune]]'' [is] about a woman in a coma, ''[[Awakenings (film)|Awakenings]]'' [is] about a man in a coma; and ''Dances with Wolves'' [was] released by Orion, a studio in a coma."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0lWrZL0EHE Billy Crystal Oscars Opening -- 1991 Academy Awards.] [[The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]]-YouTube Channel. Retrieved on June 11, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was during this time that [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] stepped in to co-finance and assume production over many of Orion TV's shows it had in production, such as ''[[American Detective]]'' and ''[[Equal Justice (TV series)|Equal Justice]]''.

On November 25, 1991, Orion sold its ''[[Hollywood Squares]]'' format rights to [[King World Productions]] after Orion closed down its television division.&lt;ref name="broadcasting19911125"&gt;{{cite journal|date=1991-11-25|title=King Gets the Square |journal=Broadcasting|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 11, 1991, Orion filed for [[Chapter 11 bankruptcy]] protection.&lt;ref name="RFB" /&gt;

In December 1991, Orion was in talks with [[New Line Cinema]], a successful independent film company, to acquire the bankrupt studio. By the following April, Orion and New Line Cinema cancelled their plans on the issue of price. [[Republic Pictures]] and the then-new [[Savoy Pictures]] also attempted to buy Orion, but no deal materialized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= THE MEDIA BUSINESS; New Line Breaks Off Talks On Buying Orion Pictures|work= The New York Times|date=1992-04-22|url= https://www.nytimes.com/1992/04/22/business/the-media-business-new-line-breaks-off-talks-on-buying-orion-pictures.html?scp=6&amp;sq=Orion%20Pictures&amp;st=cse|accessdate=2010-08-08 | first=Richard W. | last=Stevenson}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= COMPANY NEWS; 2d Company Makes Bid for Orion Pictures|work= The New York Times|date=1992-04-10|url= https://www.nytimes.com/1992/04/10/business/company-news-2d-company-makes-bid-for-orion-pictures.html?scp=2&amp;sq=Orion%20Pictures&amp;st=cse|accessdate=2010-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the Academy Awards ceremony, broadcast on March 30, 1992, Crystal yet made another reference to Orion, this time about its demise: {{cquote|Take a great studio like Orion: a few years ago Orion released ''Platoon'', it wins Best Picture. ''Amadeus'', Best Picture. Last year, they released ''Dances with Wolves'' wins Best Picture. This year ''The Silence of the Lambs'' is nominated for Best Picture. And they can't afford to have another hit! But there is good news and bad news. The good news is that Orion was just purchased, and the bad news is it was bought by the House of Representatives.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCAi1744Sa0 Billy Crystal Oscars Opening -- 1992 Academy Awards.] [[The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]]-YouTube Channel. Retrieved on June 11, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

''The Silence of the Lambs'' swept all five major Academy Awards; however, a majority of key executives, as well as the talent they had deals with, had left the studio. Hollywood observers had doubts that Orion would be resurrected to its former glory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Orion Pictures' Losses Widen|work= The New York Times|date=1992-04-08|url= https://www.nytimes.com/1992/04/08/business/orion-pictures-losses-widen.html?scp=8&amp;sq=Orion%20Pictures&amp;st=cse|accessdate=2010-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 5, 1992, Orion reemerged from bankruptcy. Its reorganization plan would allow for Orion to continue producing and releasing films, but financing for the features would be provided by outside sources, with the studio purchasing the distribution rights to them after their completion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/1992/biz/news/orion-emerges-from-chapter-11-100780/|title=Orion emerges from Chapter 11|last=Brennan|first=Paul Noglows, Judy|date=1992-11-06|work=Variety|access-date=2017-05-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yahoo.brand.edgar-online.com/displayfilinginfo.aspx?FilingID=343274-5759-53456&amp;type=sect&amp;tabindex=2|title=EDGAR Pro|website=yahoo.brand.edgar-online.com|access-date=2017-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Orion's bankruptcy also delayed the release of many films the studio had produced or acquired, among them: ''[[Love Field (film)|Love Field]]'' (1992), ''[[RoboCop 3]]'' (1993), ''[[The Dark Half (film)|The Dark Half]]'' (1993), ''[[Blue Sky (film)|Blue Sky]]'' (1994), ''[[Car 54, Where Are You? (film)|Car 54, Where Are You?]]'' (1994), ''[[Clifford (film)|Clifford]]'' (1994), ''[[The Favor]]'' (1994), and ''[[There Goes My Baby (film)|There Goes My Baby]]'' (1994). Orion started releasing these films after their reorganization. ''Blue Sky'' won star [[Jessica Lange]] an Academy Award for Best Actress in 1995.

===Metromedia International Group===
In November 1995, Orion and three other companies controlled by Kluge were merged to form the Metromedia International Group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/11/02/business/the-media-business-actava-group-seals-stock-swap.html|title=THE MEDIA BUSINESS;Actava Group Seals Stock Swap|last=Bloomberg Business News|first=|date=1995-11-02|work=|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-11-01|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Few of the films released during the four years after [[Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code|bankruptcy protection]] were successful either critically or commercially.

In 1996, Metromedia acquired production company [[Motion Picture Corporation of America]], and installed its heads, Brad Krevoy and Steve Stabler, as co-presidents of Orion. Both received a six picture put picture distribution deal as a part of their contracts.&lt;ref name=lat&gt;{{cite news|last1=Horn|first1=John|title=Coming soon, to very few theaters|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2005/feb/21/entertainment/et-mgm21|accessdate=June 10, 2016|work=Los Angeles Times|date=February 21, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the years ahead, Orion produced very few films, and primarily released films from other producers, including [[Artisan Entertainment|LIVE Entertainment]]. [[Orion Classics]], minus its founders (who had moved to [[Sony Pictures|Sony Pictures Entertainment]] and founded [[Sony Pictures Classics]]), continued to acquire popular [[art-house]] films, such as ''[[Boxing Helena]]'' (1993), before Metromedia merged the subsidiary with [[The Samuel Goldwyn Company|Samuel Goldwyn Entertainment]] in 1996.

===Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer subsidiary===
In July 1997, Metromedia shareholders approved the sale of Orion (as well as Samuel Goldwyn Entertainment and [[Motion Picture Corporation of America]]) to [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]. This led to the withdrawal of 85 employees, including Krevoy and Stabler, while 111 other employees were to be laid off within nine months, leaving 25 of them to work at MGM. Orion also brought with it, a two thousand film library, ten completed movies and five direct-to-video features for future release&lt;ref name=vty1&gt;{{cite news | last = Weiner | first = Rex | date = July 11, 1997 | title = MGM ends Orion orbit | url = https://variety.com/1997/film/news/mgm-ends-orion-orbit-1116676950/ | newspaper= Variety | location     =  | access-date  = Jun 10, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Krevoy and Stabler movie put picture distribution deal.&lt;ref name=lat/&gt; Krevoy and Stabler retained the right to the Motion Picture Corporation of America name and their three top movies. Metromedia retained Goldwyn Entertainment's Landmark Theatre Group.&lt;ref name=vty1/&gt;  ''[[One Man's Hero]]'' (1999) was the last film released by Orion for 15 years.

MGM kept Orion intact as a corporation thus to avoid its Warner Bros. video distribution agreement and began distributing Orion Pictures films under the Orion Home Video label. MGM acquired the 2/3 of pre-1996 [[PolyGram Filmed Entertainment]] library from [[Seagram]] in 1999 for $250&amp;nbsp;million, increasing their library holdings to 4,000. The PolyGram libraries were purchased by its Orion Pictures subsidiary so as to avoid its 1990 video distribution agreement with Warner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Eller|first=Claudia |title=MGM Agrees to Acquire PolyGram Movie Library|date=23 October 1998|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1998/oct/23/business/fi-35357 |accessdate=29 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1999, MGM bought out its distribution contract with Warner Bros. for $225 million, effectively ending the distribution problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thefreelibrary.com/MGM+REGAINS+VIDEO+RIGHTS%253B+$225+MILLION+DEAL+TO+HELP+SELL+DVDS.-a083605917|title=MGM REGAINS VIDEO RIGHTS; $225 MILLION DEAL TO HELP SELL DVDS. - Free Online Library|website=www.thefreelibrary.com|access-date=2018-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, MGM revived the Orion Television brand (after Orion's original TV unit was shut down during its bankruptcy era in the early 1990s) as Orion TV Productions with a new syndicated series, ''[[Lauren Lake's Paternity Court|Paternity Court]]''.&lt;ref name=vty0&gt;{{cite news|last1=Saval|first1=Malina|title=MGM TV Rides High With ‘Vikings’ and ‘Fargo’|url=https://variety.com/2014/tv/festivals/mgm-tv-rides-high-with-vikings-and-fargo-1201152961/|accessdate=October 28, 2015|work=Variety|issue=April 1, 2014|publisher=Penske Business Media, LLC|date=April 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Orion Pictures name, also as Orion Releasing, was extended in fourth quarter 2014 for smaller multi-platform video on demand and limited theatrical distribution. Its name was first seen again on September 10, 2014 in front of the trailer for ''[[The Town That Dreaded Sundown (2014 film)|The Town That Dreaded Sundown]]'' that was released in October. The label's first release was the Brazilian film ''Vestido pra Casar''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Torrelio|first1=Sebastian|title=Orion Pictures Label Returns for First Time in 15 Years|url=https://variety.com/2014/film/news/orion-pictures-label-returns-for-first-time-in-15-years-1201304184/|accessdate=March 10, 2017|work=Variety|date=September 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2015, [[Entertainment One Films]] relaunched the [[Momentum Pictures]] banner with an announced deal with Orion Pictures to co-acquire and co-distribute films in the United States and Canada, and selected foreign markets, such as the [[United Kingdom]] (Momentum's country of origin). The initial films under the deal were ''[[The Wannabe]]'', ''[[Fort Tilden (film)|Fort Tilden]]'' and ''[[Balls Out (2014 film)|Balls Out]]''.&lt;ref name=hwr&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/tiff-eone-relaunches-momentum-pictures-821351|title=TIFF: eOne Relaunches Momentum Pictures Label With Orion Releasing Deal|newspaper=The Hollywood Reporter|access-date=2016-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other films released by Orion Pictures and [[Momentum Pictures]] include ''[[Pocket Listing (film)|Pocket Listing]]'' and ''[[Diablo (2015 film)|Diablo]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Kay | first=Jeremy | url=http://www.screendaily.com/news/production/shoot-wraps-on-pocket-listing/5065176.article | title=Shoot wraps on Pocket Listing | website=ScreenDaily | date=January 8, 2014 | accessdate=February 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Busch | first=Anita | title=Orion Pictures Picks up ‘Pocket Listing’ For Limited Theatrical Release | url=http://deadline.com/2016/11/pocket-listing-theatrical-release-2016-rob-lowe-burt-reynolds-1201848696/ | website=Deadline | date=November 4, 2016 | accessdate=February 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hollywood Reporter"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Vlessing|first1=Ethan|title=Scott Eastwood's 'Diablo' Nabbed by Orion Releasing, Momentum|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/scott-eastwoods-diablo-nabbed-by-840589|accessdate=18 March 2016|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=16 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, Orion TV added another court series, ''Couples Court'', to its syndicated line up. The show is presided over by a husband wife team and deals with marital issues primarily cheating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Desk|first1=TV News|title=Orion Television's COUPLES COURT Coming to National Syndication This Fall|url=http://www.broadwayworld.com/bwwtv/article/Orion-Televisions-COUPLES-COURT-Coming-to-National-Syndication-This-Fall-20170113#|accessdate=March 10, 2017|website=Broadway World|publisher=Wisdom Digital Media|date=January 13, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 6, 2017, MGM officially revitalized the Orion Pictures brand as a standalone, US theatrical marketing and distribution arm with the hiring of John Hegeman, who had come from [[Blumhouse Productions|Blumhouse Tilt]] (distributor of Orion's ''[[The Town That Dreaded Sundown (2014 film)|The Town That Dreaded Sundown]]'' and ''[[The Belko Experiment]]'') and incidentally got his start working at the old Orion in the 1980s. Hegeman will serve as president of the expanded label and report to [[Jonathan Glickman]], president of MGM's motion picture group. Under his leadership, the "new" Orion will produce, market and distribute four to six modestly budgeted films a year across genres and platforms, both wide and limited releases for targeted audiences, and its first release, the young adult romance drama ''[[Every Day (2018 film)|Every Day]]'', was released in February 23, 2018.&lt;ref name="variety"&gt;{{cite web|author=Dave McNary |url=https://variety.com/2017/film/news/mgm-re-launching-orion-pictures-distributor-1202548889/ |title=MGM Relaunching Orion Pictures as Distributor |work=Variety |date=2017-09-06 |accessdate=2018-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="thr"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/mgm-relaunches-orion-pictures-under-john-hegeman-1035761 |title=MGM Relaunches Orion Pictures Under John Hegeman |work=The Hollywood Reporter |date= |accessdate=2018-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="deadline"&gt;{{cite web|last=Busch |first=Anita |url=http://deadline.com/2017/09/orion-pictures-relaunched-mgm-john-hegeman-president-1202162614/ |title=Orion Label Relaunched By MGM As Stand-Alone; John Hegeman President |website=Deadline |date=2017-09-06 |accessdate=2018-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Nick Romano |url=http://ew.com/movies/2017/12/06/angourie-rice-every-day-first-look-photos/ |title=Angourie Rice stars in Every Day movie first-look photos |website=EW.com |date=2017-12-06 |accessdate=2018-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Orion's library today===
Almost all of Orion's post-1982 releases, as well as most of the AIP and Filmways backlogs and all of the television output originally produced and distributed by Orion Television, now bear the MGM name. However, in most cases, the 1980s Orion logo has been retained or added, in the case of the Filmways and AIP libraries.

Most ancillary rights to Orion's back catalog from the 1978–1982 joint venture period remain with Warner Bros., including such movies as ''[[10 (film)|10]]'' (1979), ''[[Caddyshack]]'' (1980), ''[[Arthur (1981 film)|Arthur]]'' (1981), ''[[Excalibur (film)|Excalibur]]'' (1981), and ''[[Prince of the City (film)|Prince of the City]]'' (1981). Some post-1982 films originally released by Orion &amp;mdash; ''[[Lionheart (1987 film)|Lionheart]]'' (1987), ''[[The Unbearable Lightness of Being (film)|The Unbearable Lightness of Being]]'' (1988), and ''[[Amadeus (film)|Amadeus]]'' (1984) (the latter two being [[Saul Zaentz]] productions) &amp;mdash; are currently distributed by Warner Bros. as well. [[HBO]] also owns video distribution rights to ''[[Three Amigos]]'' (1986), which co-produced the film and owns pay-TV rights. However, MGM owns all other rights and the film's copyright.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} ''[[The Wanderers (1979 film)|The Wanderers]]'' is owned by the film's producers; however, the copyright is held by MGM/Orion.

Woody Allen's films ''[[A Midsummer Night's Sex Comedy]]'' (1982) and ''[[Zelig]]'' (1983) are the only Orion films from the original joint venture period now owned by MGM. Orion releases produced by the [[Hemdale Film Corporation]] and [[Barry Spikings|Nelson Entertainment]] are included in MGM's library as well, and are incorporated into the Orion library. MGM via [[PolyGram|Polygram Entertainment]] did not acquire the Hemdale films, (which include ''The Terminator'', ''Hoosiers'',  and ''Platoon'') or the Nelson films (including the ''Bill &amp; Ted'' films), until MGM via Polygram Entertainment bought the pre-1996 library of PolyGram Filmed Entertainment, which included both companies' libraries, although the television and digital rights to certain Nelson films are now held by [[Paramount Television]], with television syndication handled on behalf of Paramount Television by [[Trifecta Entertainment &amp; Media]].

Many of the film and television holdings of [[The Samuel Goldwyn Company]] have now also been incorporated into the Orion library (with ownership currently held by MGM), and the copyright on some of this material is held by Orion, except ''[[Flipper (1995 TV series)|The New Adventures of Flipper]]'' now carries the MGM Television Entertainment copyright.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

MGM still holds distribution rights to the 1980s revival of ''[[The Hollywood Squares|Hollywood Squares]]'' and ''[[High Rollers]]'' the company produced, as well as the remnants of the Heatter-Quigley library that was not erased, including all remaining episodes of the original ''Squares''; they do not own the rights to the format, which is currently owned by [[CBS Television Distribution]], successor-in-interest to King World, who purchased the format rights in 1991 and produced another syndicated revival from 1998 to 2004.

Orion distributed the first [[Rambo (film series)|Rambo film]], ''[[First Blood]]'' (1982).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Maslin|first=Janet|title=First Blood (1982) 'FIRST BLOOD'|date=22 October 1982|publisher=''[[The New York Times]]''|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9E0DE0DB143BF931A15753C1A964948260|accessdate=24 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; That film, like the rest of the ''Rambo'' franchise, is now owned by [[StudioCanal]] as a result of purchasing the library of its co-distributor, [[Carolco Pictures]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lambie|first=Ryan|title=The rise and fall of Carolco|date=11 March 2014|url=http://www.denofgeek.us/movies/carolco/233689/the-rise-and-fall-of-carolco|accessdate=24 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rat-baiting''' is a [[blood sport]], which involves placing [[Rat-catcher|captured rats]] in a pit or other enclosed area and then [[Gambling|betting]] on how long it takes a [[Bait (dogs)|dog]], usually a [[terrier]], to kill them. It is now [[Crime|illegal]] in most countries.

== History ==
In 1835, the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] implemented an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] called the [[Cruelty to Animals Act 1835]], which prohibited the baiting of some animals such as the [[bull]], [[bear]], and other large animals. However, rat baiting was not enforced and ratting competitions came to the forefront as a [[gambling]] sport. At one time, in London, there were at least 70 rat pits.&lt;ref name="nightattheratpit"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.hamiltonparanormal.com/rattery/history.html | title=Ratting History: A Night at the Rat Pit | author=C &amp; G's Crazy Critters Rattery | accessdate=14 July 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060323213510/http://www.hamiltonparanormal.com/rattery/history.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 23 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Rat-baiting2.jpg|thumb|325px|Turnspit Quakers Alley]]

== Atmosphere ==
[[James Wentworth Day]], a follower of the sport of rat baiting, described his experience and the atmosphere at one of the last old rat pits in London during those times.

{{quote|This was a rather dirty, small place, in the middle of the Cambridge Circus, London. You went down a rotten wooden stair and entered a large, underground cellar, which was created by combining the cellars of two houses. The cellar was full of smoke, stench of rats, dogs, and dirty human beings as well. The stale smell of flat beer was almost overpowering. Gas lights illuminated the centre of the cellar, a ring enclosed by wood barriers similar to a small Roman circus arena, and wooden bleachers, arranged one over the other, rose stepwise above it nearly to the ceiling. This was the pit for dog fights, cockfights, and rat killing. A hundred rats were put in it; large wagers went back and forth on whose dog could kill the most rats within a minute. The dogs worked in exemplary fashion, a grip, a toss, and it was all over for the rat. With especially skilful dogs, two dead rats flew through the air at the same time&amp;nbsp;...}}

[[File:RatBaiting1.jpg|thumb|left|350px|Rat-baiting competition]]

== Rules ==
The officials included a [[referee]] and [[timekeeper]]. Pits were sometimes covered above with wire mesh or had additional security devices installed on the walls to prevent the rats from escaping. Rules varied from match to match.

In one variation there was a weight handicap for each dog. The competing dog had to kill as many rats as the number of pounds the dog weighed, within a specific preset time.&lt;ref name="Drabble"&gt;{{cite book| author=Phil Drabble | title=The book of the dog | editor = Brian Vesey-Fitzgerald, ed. | chapter= Staffords and baiting sports | year=1948 | publisher=Borden Publishing | location=Los Angeles | chapterurl=http://www.staffordmall.com/stoutheart-rats.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prescribed number of rats was released and the dog was put in the ring. The clock started the moment the dog touched the ground. When the dog seized the last rat, his owner grabbed it and the clock stopped.

[[File:RatBaiting.jpg|thumb|225px|Dogs used in rat-baiting varied in size]]

Rats that were thought still to be alive were laid out on the table in a circle before the referee. The referee then struck the animals three times on the tail with a stick. If a rat managed to crawl out of the circle, it was considered to be alive.&lt;ref name="Drabble" /&gt; Depending on the particular rules for that match, the dog may be disqualified or have to go back in the ring with these rats and kill them. The new time was added to the original time.

A combination of the quickest time, the number of rats, and the dog's weight decided the victory. A rate of five seconds per rat killed was considered quite satisfactory; fifteen rats in a minute was an excellent result.

Cornered rats will attack and can deliver a very painful bite. It was not uncommon to see a ratter left with only one eye in its retirement.

== Rat-catcher ==
Before the contest could begin there was a requirement for the capture of potentially thousands of rats. The [[rat-catcher]] would be called upon to fulfill this requirement. [[Jack Black (rat catcher)|Jack Black]], a rat-catcher from [[Victorian era|Victorian]] [[England]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=London Labor and the London Poor | volume=3 | author=Henry Mayhew | location=London | publisher=Griffen, Bohn and Company | year=1851 | chapter=Jack Black | chapterurl=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2000.01.0028&amp;query=head%3D%236}}&lt;/ref&gt; supplied live rats for baiting.

== Technique ==
Faster dogs were preferred. They would bite once. The process was described as "rather like a sheepdog keeping a flock bunched to be brought out singly for dipping," where the dog would herd the rats together, and kill any rats that left the pack with a quick bite.&lt;ref name="Drabble" /&gt;

== Breeds ==
[[File:Rat-baiting6.jpg|thumb|325px|Terrier "Major"]]

The ratting dogs were typically [[working terrier]] breeds, which included, but were not limited to, the [[Bull and Terrier]], [[Bull Terrier]], [[Bedlington Terrier]], [[Fox Terrier]], [[Jack Russell Terrier]], [[Rat Terrier]], [[Black and Tan Terrier]], [[Manchester Terrier]], [[Yorkshire Terrier]] and [[Staffordshire Bull Terrier]]. The degree of care used in breeding these ratters is clear in their [[Pedigree (dog)|pedigree]] with good breeding leading to increased business opportunities. Successful breeders were highly regarded in those times. In modern times, the [[Plummer Terrier]] is considered a premiere breed for rat catching.

=== Billy ===
A celebrated [[Bull and Terrier]] named "Billy" weighing approximately 12&amp;nbsp;kg (26 pounds), had a proud fighting history and the pedigree reflects the build-up over a period of years. The dog was owned by Charles Dew and was bred by the breeder [[James Yardington]]. On the paternal side is "Old Billy" from the kennel of [[John Tattersal]] from [[Wotton-under-Edge]], [[Gloucestershire]] and was descended from the best line of all [[Old English Bulldog]]s. On the maternal side, is "Yardington's Sal" descended from the Curley line. The pedigree of all these dogs can be traced back more than forty years and there are numerous old accounts about them.

The October 1822, edition of ''[[The Sporting Magazine]]'' provided descriptions of two rat pit matches with Billy, quoted as follows:

[[File:Rat Killing Dog.jpg|thumb|325px|Billy, the celebrated Rat Killing Dog, London, c.&amp;nbsp;1823]]

{{quote|Thursday night, Oct. 24, at a quarter before eight o'clock, the lovers of rat-killing enjoyed a feast of delight in a prodigious raticide at the Cockpit, Westminster. The place was crowded. The famous dog Billy, of rat-killing notoriety, 26 lb. weight, was wagered, for twenty sovereigns, to kill one hundred rats in twelve minutes. The rats were turned out loose at once in a 12-feet square, and the floor whitened, so that the rats might be visible to all. The set-to began, and Billy exerted himself to the utmost. At four minutes and three quarters, as the hero's head was covered with gore, he was removed from the pit, and his chaps being washed, he lapped some water to cool his throat. Again he entered the arena, and in vain did the unfortunate victims labour to obtain security by climbing against the sides of the pit, or by crouching beneath the hero. By twos and threes they were caught, and soon their mangled corpses proved the valour of the victor. Some of the flying enemy, more valiant than the rest, endeavoured by seizing this Quinhus Flestrum of heroic dogs by the ears, to procure a respite, or to sell their life as dearly as possible; but his grand paw soon swept off the buzzers, and consigned them to their fate. At seven minutes and a quarter, or according to another watch, for there were two umpires and two watches, at seven minutes and seventeen seconds, the victor relinquished the glorious pursuit, for all his foes lay slaughtered on the ensanguined plain. Billy was then caressed and fondled by many; the dog is estimated by amateurs as a most dextrous animal; he is, unfortunately, what the French Monsieurs call borg-ne, that is, blind of an eye.-This precious organ was lost to him some time since by the intrepidity of an inimical rat, which as he had not seized it in a proper place, turned round on its murderer, and reprived him by one bite of the privilege of seeing with two eyes in future. The dog BILLY, of rat-killing notoriety, on the evening of the 13th instant, again exhibited his surprising dexterity; he was wagered to kill one hundred rats within twelve minutes; but six minutes and twenty five seconds only elapsed, when every rat lay stretched on the gory plain, without the least symptom of life appearing.' Billy was decorated with a silver collar, and a number of ribband bows, and was led off amidst the applauses of the persons assembled.}}

Billy's best competition results are as follows:

Billy's career was crowned on 22 April 1823, when a world record was set with a hundred rats killed in five-and-a-half minutes. This record stood until 1862 when it was claimed by another ratter named "Jacko". Billy continued in the rat pit until old age reportedly with only one eye and two teeth remaining.

=== Jacko ===
According to the ''[[Sporting Chronicle Annual]]'', the world record in rat killing is held by a black and tan [[Bull Terrier]] named "Jacko" weighing about thirteen pounds and owned by [[Jemmy Shaw]].&lt;ref&gt;Mayhew, H. (1851). ''[https://dl.tufts.edu/catalog/tei/tufts:UA069.005.DO.00079/chapter/c1s4 London Labour and the London Poor, Volume 3, Chp 1, Jimmy Shaw.]'' London: Griffen, Bohn and Company, Stationer's Hall Court.&lt;/ref&gt; Jacko had the following contest results:

|}

Jacko set two world records, the first on 29 July 1862, with a killing time of 2.7 seconds per rat and the second on 1 May 1862, with his fight against one hundred rats, where Jacko worked two seconds faster than the previous world record holder "Billy". The feat of killing 1,000 rats took place over a ten-week period, with one hundred rats being killed each week ending on 1 May 1862.

== Decline ==

The last public competition took place in [[Leicester]] in 1912. The owner was prosecuted, fined and had to give a promise to the court that he would never again promote such entertainment.&lt;ref name="nightattheratpit" /&gt; Toward the latter half of [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]]'s reign, a more humane attitude toward canines gradually emerged, the queen's love of animals setting the example.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} Baiting sports diminished in popularity and the [[Conformation show|exhibition of dogs]] slowly replaced the attractions of the dog pit.

== Ratting in modern times ==

Ratting and rat-baiting are not the same activities. Ratting is the [[legal]] use of dogs for [[pest control]] of non-captured rats in an unconfined space, such as a barn or field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2639">'''Royalty-free''', or '''RF''', refers to the right to use [[copyright]] material or [[intellectual property]] without the need to pay [[royalties]] or [[license|license fees]] for each use, per each copy or volume sold or some time period of use or sales.

==Computer standards==
Many computer industry standards, especially those developed and submitted by industry consortiums or individual companies, involve royalties for the actual implementation of these standards. These royalties are typically charged on a "per port"/"per device" basis, where the manufacturer of end-user devices has to pay a small fixed fee for each device sold, and also include a substantial annual fixed fee.  With millions of devices sold each year, the royalties can amount to several millions of dollars, which is a significant burden for the manufacturer. Examples of such royalties-based standards include IEEE 1394, [[HDMI]], and H.264/[[MPEG-1|MPEG]]-4 AVC. 

Royalty-free standards do not include any "per-port" or "per-volume" charges or annual payments for the actual implementation of the standard, even though the text of the actual specification is typically protected by copyright and needs to be purchased from the standards body. Most [[open standard]]s are royalty-free, and many proprietary standards are royalty-free as well. Examples of royalty-free standards include [[DisplayPort]], [[VGA]], [[VP8]], and [[Matroska]].

==Photography and illustrations==
In [[photography]] and the [[illustration]] industry, it refers to a [[copyright]] license where the user has the right to use the picture without many restrictions based on one-time payment to the licensor. The user can therefore use the image in several projects without having to purchase any additional licenses. RF licenses can not be given on an exclusive basis. In [[stock photography]], RF is one of the common licenses sometimes contrasted with [[Rights Managed]] licenses and often employed in [[Subscription business model|subscription-based]] or [[microstock photography|microstock]] photography business models.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Peres| first = Michael R| title = The Focal encyclopaedia of photography: digital imaging, theory and applications, history, and science| publisher = Focal Press| year = 2007| pages = 352–353| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=VYyldcYfq3MC&amp;dq=%22rights+managed%22+license&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn = 978-0-240-80740-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15791">The [[rule of law]] is one of the longest established [[common law]] fundamental principles of the governance of the [[United Kingdom]], dating to [[Magna Carta]] of 1215, particularly [[jurisprudence]] following its late 13th century re-drafting.  It as a minimum subjects an otherwise [[absolute monarch]] ([[executive (government)|executive]]) and all free people within its jurisdictions, primarily those of [[Jurisdiction of England and Wales|England and Wales]], [[Jurisdiction of Scotland|Scotland]] and [[Jurisdiction of Northern Ireland|Northern Ireland]] to [[legal doctrine]]s known as the general principles of law.  It has evolved to work only alongside equal application of the law to all free people 'equality before the law' and within the framework of the [[constitutional monarchy]] supports the legal doctrine of [[parliamentary sovereignty]].  Exactly what it entails beyond this and the way that different aspects of the rule of law principle are applied, depends on the specific situation and era.

Among recognised academics in this field are [[Albert Dicey]], [[Joseph Raz]] (building on thoughts by [[Friedrich Hayek]]) and [[Trevor Allan (legal philosopher)|Trevor Allan]], who have proposed contrasting ideas about the scope of the rule of law: specifically, whether the emphasis is on legal form or substantive content and normatively if it should be.

==Ideas==
The rule of law is emphasised through many separate ideas. Among them are that [[law and order (politics)|law and order]] in contrast to [[anarchy]]; the running of government in line with the law (i.e. "legal government") and normative discussion about the rights of the state as compared to the individual.&lt;ref name="bradley95"&gt;Bradley, Ewing (2011). p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Albert Venn Dicey]] described the rule of law as acting in three ways: the predominance of regular law as opposed to the influence of arbitrary power; equality before the law; and, that constitutional laws are not the source but the consequence of the [[human rights|rights of individuals]].&lt;ref name="dicey"&gt;Dicey (1914). Part 2, chapter 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

The specific checking of arbitrary power is its oldest and most definitive concept as a consequence of [[Magna Carta]] and its byproduct, the [[Model Parliament|first representative Parliament]] of England (and soon officially thereafter known as of England of Wales), which denied for the first time from the King the completely unfettered powers formerly exercised by the most powerful [[absolute monarch]]s on the throne.  The key clause in the document has been consistently translated from identical, though abbreviated, Latin.

:''To no one will we sell, to no one deny or delay right or justice.''

This was by the 14th century interpreted by Parliament as guaranteeing [[jury trial|trial by jury]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bl.uk/magna-carta/articles/magna-carta-an-introduction "Magna Carta an introduction"] The [[British Library]]. Retrieved 4 February 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wade/&gt;

Similarly in Scotland a Parliament evolved.  Before its union with England and Wales in 1707 it was long portrayed as a constitutionally defective body&lt;ref&gt;R. Rait, 'Parliaments of Scotland' (1928)&lt;/ref&gt; that acted merely as a [[Rubber stamp (politics)|rubber stamp]] for royal decisions, but research during the early 21st century has found that it played an active role in [[Politics of Scotland|Scottish affairs]], and was sometimes a thorn in the side of the [[List of Scottish monarchs|Scottish crown]].&lt;ref&gt;Brown and Tanner, passim; R. Tanner, ''The Late Medieval Scottish Parliament'', ''passim''; K. Brown and A. Mann, ''History of the Scottish Parliament'', ii, ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt;

The enforcement of the doctrine of [[habeas corpus]] was widely achieved in the 17th century, however with [[slavery]] primarily [[British Empire|in the colonies]] continuing, it was not until the successes of [[abolitionism in the United Kingdom]], the [[Slave Trade Act of 1807]] and [[Slavery Abolition Act 1833]], that equality before the law throughout the Empire was in a formal legal sense achieved in this respect.

The [[Bill of Rights 1689]] and two most recent [[Act of Settlement 1703|Acts of Settlement (1701 and 1703)]] imposed constraints on the monarch and it fell to Parliament under the doctrine of Parliamentary sovereignty to impose its own [[Constitutional convention (political custom)|constitutional convention]]s involving the people, the monarch (or Secretaries of State in cabinet and [[Privy Council]]) and the court system.  All of these three groups of institutions have proven wary of upsetting or offending the others, adopting conventions designed to ensure their long-term integrity and hence self-preservation.&lt;ref name=wade/&gt;

After ordinary executive decisions were delegated, such as to a [[Robert Walpole|recognised Prime Minister and cabinet system]] from the mid 18th century, following on from the [[Bill of Rights 1689]] in the [[Glorious Revolution]], the highest courts laid down [[jurisprudence]] entrenching the growing doctrines of the [[Enrolled bill]] rule and [[Parliamentary sovereignty]].  In return Parliament has acquiesced in the senior courts' ability to declare unlawful new legislation based on older [[Treaty]]-based legislation for instance the [[Merchant Shipping Act 1988]] in the [[Factortame|Factortame I and IV]] decisions and executive actions in [[judicial review]]s often based on the [[Human Rights Act 1998]] (and in turn or separately the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] and [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights|International Covenants]]).  These developments have entrenched the doctrine of the rule of law as part of the constitution.&lt;ref name=wade&gt;{{cite journal|title=Sovereignty - Evolution or Revolution?|journal=[[Law Quarterly Review]]|year=1996|first=Sir William|last=Wade|authorlink=Henry William Rawson Wade|volume=112|issue=|page=574|id= |format=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prevention of crime==
Law and order requires the prevention of crime as well as the contribution of authorities
, and, as such, it does not matter by what means these are achieved, or what the characteristics of the law are. This concept of the rule of the law can, therefore, be upheld by even the most tyrannical dictatorship. Such a regime may allow for the normal operation of courts between private parties, and the limited questioning of the government within the dictatorial framework.&lt;ref name="bradley95"/&gt; Whether the rule of law can truly exist without [[democracy]] is debated. [[Freedom of expression]] and action seems to be what the prevention of crime allows citizens; therefore, limiting it by autocratic means has been considered incompatible with the rule of law. However, the picture is much clearer in the other direction: for democracy to thrive, the rule of law (in this limited sense) must be observed.&lt;ref&gt;Bradley, Ewing (2011). pp. 95&amp;ndash;96.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal form==
[[Public authority|Public authorities]] must act within the law assigned to them, a second approach to the rule of law. Any actions taken outside the law are ''ultra vires'' and cannot be sanctioned by the courts. ''[[Entick v Carrington]]'' was a landmark case in terms of the English law, with the famous dictum of Camden LJ: "If this is law it would be found in our books, but no such law ever existed in this country".&lt;ref&gt;[1765] EWHC KB J98&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bradley96"&gt;Bradley, Ewing (2011). p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joseph Raz]] identifies government following the law as a [[tautology (rhetoric)|tautology]]: if the will of those inside the government were expressed outside their legal constraints, they would no longer be acting as the government. He therefore characterises this legal form argument as one of mere obedience to the law; ensuring those in government follow the laws as those outside it should. He rejects that as the sole conception of the rule of law.&lt;ref&gt;Raz (1977). pp. 196&amp;ndash;197.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2008 case of ''[[R (Bancoult) v Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs (No 2)]]'', an Order in Council of the British government was found to have no basis in law by a minority of judges on final appeal. Additional powers can be granted to actors on behalf of the government only through parliament. In the United Kingdom, sanctions for departing from these rules come through ordinary court procedure; in other countries they may be assigned to designated courts.&lt;ref name="bradley96"/&gt; Government departments are directly liable for damage caused by their acts; however, the sovereign retains immunity from prosecution. This immunity runs wider that the Head of State of other countries, for example, the [[President of the United States]] may be impeached then put on trial.&lt;ref&gt;Bradley, Ewing (2011). pp. 96&amp;ndash;97.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[M v Home Office]]'' the Home Secretary was found to be liable for [[contempt of court]]. On the other hand, Acts of Parliament that contravene basic rights &amp;ndash; such as the indefinite detention without trial of suspected terrorists &amp;ndash; whilst adhering to this concept of the rule of law.&lt;ref&gt;Bradley, Ewing (2011). p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt;

This is identified by Dicey as part of his first conception: "a man may with us be punished for a breach of law, but he can 		be punished for nothing else".&lt;ref name="dicey"/&gt;

==Substantive content==
Any substantive version of the rule of law as it applies to the United Kingdom asks normative questions about what rules the government ''should be'' under, rather than merely ensuring it follows those it ''is'' under. The rule of law is thus likely to be invoked when considering controversial powers of the government that stray from precedent, depart from the [[European Convention of Human Rights]] as embodied in the [[Human Rights Act 1998]], and break new legislative ground.&lt;ref&gt;Bradley, Ewing (2011). pp. 97&amp;ndash;98.&lt;/ref&gt;

This interpretation is particularly controversial. If the rule of law is to enforce specific "constitutional" or "core" rights, what they should be is difficult to decide. Among them are questions of whether ideas such as the right not to be held indefinitely without trial, deemed contrary to the Convention in ''[[A and Others v Secretary of State for the Home Department|A v Home Secretary]]'', could ever be deemed appropriate if circumstances changed.&lt;ref name="bradley98"&gt;Bradley, Ewing (2011). p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''R. ex parte (Corner House Research) v Director of the Serious Fraud Office (2008)'', the defendant public prosecution body chief was deemed to allow national security considerations to take precedence over a thorough investigation into alleged bribery in certain arms deals, which is that departure from completely equal application of the law (including its application to the Crown) in order to [[right to life|protect life]] may result in a perceived breach of the modern-day rule of law.&lt;ref name="bradley98"/&gt;

[[Trevor Allan (legal philosopher)|Trevor Allan]] sees the rule of law as, primarily, a vehicle for the protection of rights against "irresponsible legislative encroachment" in the face of a government with a large authority, backed by (normally) a significant majority in the [[House of Commons (UK)|House of Commons]].&lt;ref&gt;Allan (1985). pp. 111&amp;ndash;112.&lt;/ref&gt; The rule of law is contrasted with rule by men, and the arbitrary power one man might exercise over the other &amp;ndash; the people require protection from the government.&lt;ref&gt;Allan (1985). pp. 112&amp;ndash;113.&lt;/ref&gt; This leads him to support the "core" features of the rule of law, including government acting within its legal authority.&lt;ref&gt;Allan (1985). p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt; Noting that this is not incompatible with wide discretionary powers on the part of the government, Allan then goes on to accept Raz's complaint, below, that too wide a definition is to expound a complete social philosophy. He instead chooses a conception that is not so wide, whilst being not as limited as Raz's.&lt;ref&gt;Allan (1985). pp. 113&amp;ndash;114.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opposition to substantive content==
In particular, [[Joseph Raz]] has argued that the rule of law should be limited to formal values &amp;ndash; although formal values wider than merely maintaining law and order. These include transparency of law making, [[Ex post facto|non-retroactive law]], the [[independence of the judiciary]] and wide access to the courts, and the [[right to a fair trial]].&lt;ref name="bradley98"/&gt; He suggests that the rule of law has become a by-word  for general political ideals, separate from its actual meaning: "if the rule of law is the rule of good law then to explain its nature is to expound a complete social philosophy".&lt;ref&gt;Raz (1997). p. 195.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, he identifies principles of "open and relatively stable" lawmaking, and laws that the public can live their lives by. This concept is a merely formal one, he identifies, because this could be achieved through dictatorship, democracy, or any other means.&lt;ref name="raz198"&gt;Raz (1997). p. 198.&lt;/ref&gt; He expresses confidence that this conception is not so restricted an approach as to be meaningless.&lt;ref name="raz198"/&gt; Raz drew on similar ideas expressed by [[Friedrich Hayek]], including "stripped of all technicalities, [the rule of law] means that government in all its actions is bound by rules fixed and announced beforehand – rules which make it possible to foresee with fair certainty how the authority will use its coercive powers in given circumstances and to plan one’s individual affairs on the basis of this knowledge."&lt;ref&gt;Taken from ''[[The Road to Serfdom]]'' (1945): quoted in Raz (1977) p. 195.&lt;/ref&gt; Raz identifies eight principles instead: prospective, open and clear laws; relatively stable laws; laws based on stable, open and open and  clear rules; the [[independence of the judiciary]]; the principles of natural justice (unbiased judiciary); [[judicial review]] of implementation; accessible courts; and no perversion of the law by policing discretion.&lt;ref&gt;Raz (1977). pp. 198&amp;ndash;201.&lt;/ref&gt; However, he considers the list incomplete.&lt;ref&gt;Raz (1977). p. 202.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea''' ('''SOLAS''') is an international [[maritime law|maritime treaty]] which sets minimum safety standards in the construction, equipment and operation of [[merchant ships]]. The convention requires signatory [[flag state]]s to ensure that ships flagged by them comply with at least these standards.

The current version of SOLAS is the 1974 version, known as SOLAS 1974, which came into force on 25 May 1980.&lt;ref name=IMO-Conventionstatus/&gt; As of November 2018, SOLAS 1974 had 164 contracting states,&lt;ref name=IMO-Conventionstatus&gt;[https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20151118084506/http://www.imo.org/en/About/Conventions/StatusOfConventions/Documents/status-x.xls Status of multilateral Conventions]&lt;/ref&gt; which flag about 99% of merchant ships around the world in terms of gross tonnage.&lt;ref name=IMO-Conventionstatus/&gt;

SOLAS in its successive forms is generally regarded as the most important of all international treaties concerning the safety of merchant ships.&lt;ref name=IMO-1974/&gt;&lt;ref name=IMO-Implicatiins&gt;{{citation | title = Implications of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea for the International Maritime Organization, Study by the Secretariat of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) | publisher = [[International Maritime Organization]] | page = 11 | url = http://www.imo.org/ourwork/legal/documents/implications%20of%20unclos%20for%20imo.pdf | number = LEG/MISC.7 | date = 19 January 2012 | accessdate = 6 April 2013 | quote = As of December 2011, the three conventions that include the most comprehensive sets of rules and standards on safety, pollution prevention and training and certification of seafarers, namely, SOLAS, MARPOL and STCW, have been ratified by 159, 150 and 154 States, respectively (representing approximately 99% gross tonnage of the world's merchant fleet). | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20150109051954/http://www.imo.org/OurWork/Legal/Documents/Implications%20of%20UNCLOS%20for%20IMO.pdf | archivedate = 9 January 2015 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Provisions ==
SOLAS 1974 requires flag states to ensure that ships flagged by them comply with the minimum safety standards in the construction, equipment and operation of merchant ships. The treaty includes articles setting out general obligations, etc, followed by an annexe divided into twelve chapters, two new chapters were added in 2016 and 2017.&lt;ref name="IMO-1974"/&gt; Of these, chapter five (often called 'SOLAS V') is the only one that applies to all vessels on the sea, including private yachts and small craft on local trips as well as to commercial vessels on international passages. Many countries have turned these international requirements into national laws so that anybody on the sea who is in breach of SOLAS&lt;ref name=weighing/&gt; V requirements may find themselves subject to legal proceedings.&lt;ref name="RYA-SOLASV"/&gt;

;Chapter I – General Provisions: Surveying the various types of ships and certifying that they meet the requirements of the convention.&lt;ref name="IMO-1974"/&gt;

;Chapter II-1 – Construction – Subdivision and stability, machinery and electrical installations: The subdivision of passenger ships into watertight compartments so that after damage to its hull, a vessel will remain afloat and stable.&lt;ref name="IMO-1974"/&gt;

;Chapter II-2 – Fire protection, fire detection and fire extinction: [[FSS Code|Fire safety provisions for all ships with detailed measures for passenger ships, cargo ships and tanker.]]&lt;ref name="IMO-1974"/&gt;

;Chapter IV – Radiocommunications: The [[Global Maritime Distress Safety System]] (GMDSS) requires passenger and cargo ships on international voyages to carry radio equipment, including satellite [[Emergency position-indicating radiobeacon station|Emergency Position Indicating Radio Beacons]] (EPIRBs) and [[Search and Rescue Transponder]]s (SARTs).&lt;ref name="IMO-1974"/&gt;

;Chapter V – Safety of navigation: This chapter requires governments to ensure that all vessels are sufficiently and efficiently manned from a safety point of view. It places requirements on all vessels regarding voyage and passage planning, expecting a careful assessment of any proposed voyages by all who put to sea. Every mariner must take account of all potential dangers to navigation, weather forecasts, tidal predictions, the competence of the crew, and all other relevant factors.&lt;ref name="RYA-SOLASV"/&gt; It also adds an obligation for all vessels' masters to offer assistance to those in distress and controls the use of lifesaving signals with specific requirements regarding danger and distress messages. It is different from the other chapters, which apply to certain classes of commercial shipping, in that these requirements apply to all vessels and their crews, including yachts and private craft, on all voyages and trips including local ones.&lt;ref name="IMO-1974"/&gt;

;Chapter VI – Carriage of Cargoes: Requirements for the stowage and securing of all types of cargo and cargo containers except liquids and gases in bulk.&lt;ref name="IMO-1974"/&gt;

== History ==

=== Origin and early versions ===
The first version of SOLAS Treaty was passed in 1914 in response to the sinking of the [[RMS Titanic|RMS ''Titanic'']], which prescribed numbers of [[Lifeboat (shipboard)|lifeboats]] and other emergency equipment along with safety procedures, including continuous radio watches.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = https://archive.org/details/textofconvention00inte | title = Text of the Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, Signed at London, January 20, 1914 [with Translation.] | publisher = His Majesty's Stationery Office by Harrison and Sons | location = London | year = 1914}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1914 treaty never entered into force due to the outbreak of the [[First World War]].

Further versions were adopted in 1929 and 1948.&lt;ref name=IMO-1974/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = http://www.imo.org/KnowledgeCentre/ReferencesAndArchives/HistoryofSOLAS/Documents/SOLAS%201948%20UK%20Treaty%20Series.pdf | title = International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, 1948, London, 10th June, 1948 | publisher = Her Majesty's Stationery Office | location = London | date = January 1953}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1960 version ===
The 1960 Convention was adopted on 17 June 1960 and entered into force on 26 May 1965. It was the fourth SOLAS Convention and was the first major achievement for [[International Maritime Organization]] (IMO). It represented a considerable step forward in modernising regulations and keeping up with technical developments in the shipping industry.&lt;ref name=ukpandi&gt;[http://www.ukpandi.com/knowledge/article/new-amendments-into-force-from-1st-july-2014-for-solas-convention-130154/ New amendments into force from 1st July 2014 for SOLAS Convention]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1974 version ===
In 1974 a completely new Convention was adopted to allow SOLAS to be amended and implemented within a reasonable timescale, instead of the previous procedure to incorporate amendments, which proved to be very slow. Under SOLAS 1960, it could take several years for amendments to come into force since countries had to give notice of acceptance to IMO and there was a minimum threshold of countries and [[tonnage]]. Under SOLAS 1974, amendments enter into force via a tacit acceptance procedure – this allows an amendment to enter into force on a specified date, unless objections to an amendment are received from an agreed number of parties.

The 1974 SOLAS came into force on 25 May 1980,&lt;ref name=IMO-Conventionstatus/&gt; 12 months after its ratification by at least 50 countries with at least 50% of gross tonnage. It has been updated and amended on numerous occasions since then and the Convention in force today is sometimes referred to as SOLAS, 1974, as amended.&lt;ref name="IMO-1974"/&gt;&lt;ref name=ukpandi/&gt;

In 1975 the assembly of the IMO decided that the 1974 convention should in future use [[SI]] (metric) units only.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
|url = http://www.imo.org/blast/blastDataHelper.asp?data_id=24097&amp;filename=351(IX).pdf
|title = Resolution A.351(IX) Use of metric units in the SI system in the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, 1974, and other future instruments
|work = Assembly Resolutions
|date = 12 November 1975
|accessdate = 4 September 2012
|publisher = [[International Maritime Organization]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1988 version ===
In particular, amendments in 1988 based on amendments of International Radio Regulations in 1987 replaced [[Morse code]] with the [[Global Maritime Distress Safety System]] (GMDSS) and came into force beginning 1 February 1992. The issues covered by the treaty are set out in the list of sections (above).

=== Later amendments ===
The up-to-date list of amendments to SOLAS is maintained by the [[International Maritime Organization|IMO]]. Previous amendments were made in May 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SOLAS 1974: Brief History – List of amendments to date and where to find them |url=http://www.imo.org/KnowledgeCentre/ReferencesAndArchives/HistoryofSOLAS/Documents/SOLAS%201974%20-%20Brief%20History%20-%20List%20of%20amendments%20to%20date%20and%20how%20to%20find%20them.html|archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20140725015425/http://www.imo.org/KnowledgeCentre/ReferencesAndArchives/HistoryofSOLAS/Documents/SOLAS%201974%20-%20Brief%20History%20-%20List%20of%20amendments%20to%20date%20and%20how%20to%20find%20them.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=25 July 2014|publisher=[[International Maritime Organization]]|accessdate=6 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, another later amendment is the SOLAS Container Weight Verification Regulation VI/2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IMO Requirement For Container Weight Verification|url=http://www.worldshipping.org/industry-issues/safety/cargo-weight|publisher=[[International Maritime Organization]]|access-date=3 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This regulation, implemented by the [[International Maritime Organization#Maritime Safety Committee|IMO Maritime Safety Committee (MSC)]] requires that the full weight of loaded containers must be obtained prior to being onboarded on an ocean vessel. Communicating a weight value has called for the introduction of a new [[Electronic data interchange|Electronic Data Interchange (EDI)]] communication protocol called VGM (Verified Gross Mass) or VERMAS (Verification of Mass), and involves cooperation between [[List of freight ship companies|ocean carriers]], [[Freight forwarder|Freight Forwarders/NVOCCs]], [https://www.descartes.com/knowledge-center/solas-container-weight-verification-resource-center EDI providers] as well as exporters. The regulation states that [[Export|exporters (shippers)]] are ultimately responsible to obtain a verified container weight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= MSC 94th Session Summary of SOLAS Container Weight Requirements |url=http://www.worldshipping.org/industry-issues/safety/WSC_Summarizes_the_Basic_Elements_of_the_SOLAS_Container_Weight_Verification_Requirement___January_2015_-3-.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally scheduled for implementation on July 1, 2016,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IMO Implementation and Action Dates Including SOLAS|url=http://www.imo.org/en/About/Conventions/Pages/Action-Dates.aspx|publisher=[[International Maritime Organization]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; the regulation allows for flexibility and practical refinement according to the Maritime Safety Committee Memorandum #1548&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= IMO MSC.1/Circular 1548 Updating SOLAS Regulation VI2 Clauses |url=http://www.imo.org/en/MediaCentre/HotTopics/container/Documents/MSC.1Circ.1548%20Advice.pdf |publisher=[[International Maritime Organization]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; to October 1, 2016.

The '''Smith Commission''' was announced by Prime Minister [[David Cameron]] on 19 September 2014 in the wake of the 'No' vote in the 2014 [[Scottish independence referendum, 2014|Scottish independence referendum]]. The establishment of the commission was part of the process of fulfilling '''The Vow''' made by the leaders of the three main [[Unionism in the United Kingdom|unionist]] parties during the last days of the referendum campaign. The Vow promised the devolution of more powers from the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] to the [[Scottish Parliament]] in the event of a No vote.

Following the No vote, [[Robert Smith, Baron Smith of Kelvin|Lord Smith of Kelvin]] was given the task to "convene cross-party talks and facilitate an inclusive engagement process across Scotland to produce, by 30 November 2014, Heads of Agreement with recommendations for further devolution of powers to the [[Scottish Parliament]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.smith-commission.scot/about/ |title=About |publisher=The Smith Commission |accessdate=5 October 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006142736/https://www.smith-commission.scot/about/ |archive-date=6 October 2014 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ten representatives were nominated by the political parties with elected members in the Scottish Parliament; the Commission started its discussions on 22 October.&lt;ref name = "discussions"/&gt; Agreement was reached and the report published on 27 November 2014.&lt;ref name="Haroon Siddique"&gt;{{cite news|title=New powers for Scotland: key points from the Smith commission|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/nov/27/scottish-devolution-smith-commission-key-points|date=27 November 2014|author=Haroon Siddique|newspaper=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ben Riley-Smith"&gt;{{cite news|title=Everything you need to know about the Smith Commission|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/scotland/scottish-politics/11260014/Everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-Smith-Commission.html|date=28 November 2014|author=Ben Riley-Smith|newspaper=The Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the Conservative election victory at the [[United Kingdom general election, 2015|2015 UK General Election]], the [[Scotland Bill 2015–16]] was proposed in the first Queen's Speech, to put into effect the recommendations of the Smith Commission.

==The Vow==
The Vow was a joint statement by the leaders of the three main unionist parties, [[David Cameron]], [[Ed Miliband]] and [[Nick Clegg]], promising more powers for Scotland in the event of a No vote. Included in The Vow was that in the event of a No vote:
* The [[Scottish parliament]] would be permanent
* Extensive new [[devolution|devolved powers]] would be delivered
* The [[Barnett formula]] for funding Scottish Government expenditure would continue

The Vow was published in the ''[[Daily Record (Scotland)|Daily Record]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/politics/david-cameron-ed-miliband-nick-4265992|title=David Cameron, Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg sign joint historic promise which guarantees more devolved powers for Scotland and protection of NHS if we vote No|publisher=Daily Record|accessdate=22 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; one of the main tabloid newspapers in Scotland that also backed a No vote in the referendum. The explanation and background to the publication of The Vow was explained in the Daily Record itself one year after the referendum when it outlined that following a poll showing the 'Yes' side ahead, it was felt that firm promises of more powers were required from the 'No' side.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/politics/inside-vow-how-historic-daily-6464878|title=Inside THE VOW: How historic Daily Record front page which changed the course of Britain's constitutional settlement was born|newspaper=Daily Record|accessdate=28 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Membership of Smith Commission==
The five political parties with representation in the [[Scottish Parliament]] were each invited to nominate two representatives to the Commission. Those nominated were:

*[[Maggie Chapman]] ([[Scottish Green Party]])&lt;ref name = "reps2"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-29417162 |title=Scottish referendum: Iain Gray to join powers commission |work= BBC News |date=29 September 2014|accessdate=5 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[John Swinney]] ([[Scottish National Party]])&lt;ref name = "reps2"/&gt;
*[[Adam Tomkins]] ([[Scottish Conservatives|Scottish Conservative and Unionist Party]])&lt;ref name = "reps"/&gt;

==Written submissions==
The commission invited submissions from individuals and organisations before a deadline of 31 October.&lt;ref name = "submissions"/&gt; Approximately 14,000 emails and letters were received from the public, with a further 250 contributions from groups.&lt;ref name = "submissions"&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-29857267 Smith Commission receives more than 14,000 submissions], BBC News&lt;/ref&gt;

The Conservatives, Labour and Liberal Democrats, who had all supported a no vote in the referendum, each submitted proposals which were similar to the findings of commissions they had each established before the referendum.&lt;ref name = "max"/&gt; The SNP and Scottish Greens, who had supported a yes vote, called for what was described by BBC News as "devo max".&lt;ref name = "max"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-29564608 |title=SNP calls for major post-No powers|newspaper=BBC News|date=10 October 2014|accessdate=27 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Scottish Trades Union Congress]] called for the full devolution of income tax, many welfare benefits and a different immigration policy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-29848462 Scottish trade unions call for tax, welfare and immigration powers], BBC News&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland]] pointed to the possible risks and additional administration costs caused by having different tax systems and rates.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-29690096 Accountancy body warns over new tax powers for Scotland], BBC News&lt;/ref&gt;

Three Scottish airports ([[Edinburgh Airport|Edinburgh]], [[Glasgow Airport|Glasgow]] and [[Aberdeen Airport|Aberdeen]]) proposed that [[Air Passenger Duty]] (APD) should be devolved, with a view to it being abolished in Scotland.&lt;ref name = "airports"&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-29802846 Three Scottish airports call for end to Air Passenger Duty], BBC News&lt;/ref&gt; The airports cited the restrictive effect on tourism of APD, which raised about £200 million in revenue during the 2013/14 fiscal year.&lt;ref name = "airports"/&gt; [[World Wildlife Fund|WWF Scotland]] opposed the devolution of APD in its submission, citing the growth in carbon emissions from air travel.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-29858162 Charity WWF Scotland defends airport green tax], BBC News&lt;/ref&gt; The Scottish Government previously called for the devolution of APD in 2011, when it was devolved to Northern Ireland.&lt;ref name = "ni apd"&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-16055896 Scottish airports disappointed by tax decision], BBC News&lt;/ref&gt; This action had been taken in anticipation of a similar tax being abolished in the Republic of Ireland.&lt;ref name = "ni apd"/&gt;

==The Smith Report==
The report highlights three main Heads of Agreement. These are:

* ''Pillar 1'': Providing for a durable but responsive constitutional settlement for the governance of Scotland
* ''Pillar 2'': Delivering prosperity, a healthy economy, jobs, and social justice
* ''Pillar 3'': Strengthening the financial responsibility of the Scottish Parliament

The following list are the issues discussed within the Heads of Agreement:
*Welfare – excluding pensions
*VAT relief for charities
*[[Crown Estate]]
*Energy
*Asylum support
*Remaining powers over transport
*Charity regulation
*Employability
*Equality law
*Consumer protection
*Employment law
*[[Misuse of Drugs Act 1971|Misuse of Drugs Act]]
*Scottish elections and democracy
*Tax&lt;ref name="Issues in Smith Report"&gt;{{cite web|title=Quick guide to Smith Commission Report|url=http://www.scvo.org.uk/scvo-news/quick-guide-to-smith-commission-report/|website=SCVO|publisher=SCVO|accessdate=21 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recommendations===

On 27 November 2014 the commission published its recommendations, which included the following:&lt;ref name="Haroon Siddique"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ben Riley-Smith"/&gt;

* The Scottish Parliament to have complete power to set [[income tax]] rates and bands.
* The Scottish Parliament to receive a proportion of the [[Value Added Tax (United Kingdom)|VAT]] raised in Scotland, amounting to the first ten percentage points of the standard rate (so with the current standard VAT rate of 20%, Scotland would receive 50% of the receipts). However, the Scottish Parliament would not have power to influence the UK's overall VAT rate.
* The Scottish Parliament to have increased borrowing powers to support capital investment and ensure budgetary stability. These powers are to be agreed with the UK government.
* UK legislation to state that the Scottish Parliament and Scottish Government are permanent institutions. The parliament will also be given powers to legislate over how it is elected and run.
* The Scottish Parliament to have power to extend the vote to 16- and 17-year-olds, allowing them to vote in the [[Scottish Parliament general election, 2016]].
* The Scottish Parliament to have control over a number of benefits including [[Disability Living Allowance]], [[Personal Independence Payment]], winter fuel payments and the housing elements of [[Universal Credit]], including the [[under-occupancy penalty|under-occupancy charge]] (popularly known as ''the bedroom tax'').
* The Scottish Parliament to have new powers to make discretionary payments in any area of [[welfare]] without the need to obtain prior permission from the [[Department for Work and Pensions]].
* The Scottish Parliament to have all powers of support for unemployed people through employment programmes, mainly delivered at present through the [[Work Programme]].
* The Scottish Parliament to have control over [[Air Passenger Duty]] charged on passengers flying from Scottish airports.
* Responsibility for the management of the [[Crown Estate]]'s economic assets in Scotland, including the Crown Estate's seabed and mineral and fishing rights, and the revenue generated from these assets, to be transferred to the Scottish Parliament.
* The licensing of onshore oil and gas extraction underlying Scotland to be devolved to the Scottish Parliament.
* The Scottish Government will have power to allow [[public sector]] operators to bid for [[rail franchising in Great Britain|rail franchises]] funded and specified by Scottish ministers.
* The block grant from the UK government to Scotland will continue to be determined via the operation of the [[Barnett formula]]. New rules to define how it will be adjusted at the point when powers are transferred and thereafter to be agreed by the Scottish and UK governments and put in place prior to the powers coming into force. These rules will ensure that neither the Scottish nor UK governments will lose or gain financially from the act of transferring a power.
* MPs representing constituencies across the whole of the UK to continue to decide the UK's budget, including income tax.
* The Scottish and UK governments to draw up and agree on a memorandum of understanding to ensure that devolution is not detrimental to UK-wide critical national infrastructure in relation to matters such as defence and security, oil and gas and energy.

The commission also considered devolving the power to vary all elements of Universal Credit (rather than just its housing element) but this did not appear in the commission's final recommendations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Smith Commission: Scottish welfare controls watered down at eleventh hour|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/scottish-independence/smith-commission-scottish-welfare-controls-watered-down-at-eleventh-hour-9891752.html|author=Andrew Grice|newspaper=The Independent|date=28 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reaction==

===Before publication===
In October 2014 the House of Commons ''Political and Constitutional Reform Committee'' heard evidence that was critical of the timetable set for the Smith Commission. Professor Michael Keating said he believed that the condensed timetable, which called for draft legislation by January 2015, was unrealistic. He warned of the risk that agreement would unravel because there was insufficient time to consider technical issues. Both Professor Keating and Professor Nicola McEwen said this was due to political pressures, with the unionist party leaders having vowed to grant additional powers and a [[United Kingdom general election]] due to be held on 7th May 2015.&lt;ref name = "timetable risk"&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Smith Commission timetable 'unrealistic' |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-29653880 |newspaper=BBC News |location=London |date=16 October 2014 |access-date=28 May 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Scottish Socialist Party]] were not invited to be part of the Smith Commission, leaving them the only one of the six political parties that had registered with the [[Electoral Commission]] for the referendum campaign that were not able to send a representative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.holyrood.com/articles/news/ssp-welcomes-new-members-conference |title=SSP welcomes new members at conference |first=Tom |last=Freeman |work=[[Holyrood (magazine)|Holyrood magazine]] |date=27 October 2014 |accessdate=18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===After publication===
[[Nicola Sturgeon]], Scotland’s first minister, commented "I welcome what is being recommended" but argued that it "doesn’t deliver a modern form of home rule". Claiming that too little power would be devolved to Scotland, she added "I want to have the power in our hands to create a better system to lift people out of poverty, to get our economy growing. That’s the kind of powerhouse parliament I want. Sadly it’s not the one that’s going to be delivered."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Nicola Sturgeon: Smith commission fails to deliver ‘powerhouse parliament’|author= Libby Brooks|newspaper=The Guardian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/nov/27/nicola-sturgeon-smith-commission-fails-deliver-scotland-powerhouse-parliament|date=27 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Iain Macwhirter, writing in ''[[Glasgow Herald|The Herald]]'', argued that the lack of devolution of taxes other than income tax would "lock Scotland in economic decline".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Power over income tax only will doom Scotland to a downward spiral|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/comment/columnists/power-over-income-tax-only-will-doom-scotland-to-a-downward-spiral.25879072|author=Iain Macwhirter|newspaper=Herald Scotland|date=30 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Polling in November 2014 indicated that a majority of Scots wanted greater devolution than that recommended by the Smith Commission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/13191903.Most_Scots_want_more_powers_than_Smith_provides/|title=Most Scots want more powers than Smith provides|last=Gordon|first=Tom|date=30 November 2014|work=|newspaper=Herald Scotland|access-date=|via=|author=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===After the 2015 UK general election===
The SNP won 56 of the 59 seats contested in Scotland in the 2015 UK General Election, which was held on 7 May 2015. Speaking after the election, First Minister [[Nicola Sturgeon]] called for reforms greater than that proposed by Smith, particularly in respect of taxation and welfare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2015-scotland-32680698 |title=Election 2015: Sturgeon says Cameron must go further on devolution |work=BBC News |publisher=BBC |date=10 May 2015 |accessdate=11 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former First Minister [[Jack McConnell]] described Smith as a "shambles" and called on Cameron to lead a new constitutional convention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2015-scotland-32681339 |title=Election 2015: Smith Commission a 'shambles', says Jack McConnell |work=BBC News |publisher=BBC |date=10 May 2015 |accessdate=11 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Malcolm Rifkind]], a former Secretary of State for Scotland, also expressed support for the idea of some sort of new commission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-32681218 |title=Sir Malcolm Rifkind calls for powers commission |work=BBC News |publisher=BBC |date=10 May 2015 |accessdate=11 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, Cameron said he would "look at" any proposals for further powers for Scotland but wanted to get the Smith Commission plans implemented first.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Cameron will 'look at' proposals for further Scottish devolution |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-32746049 |newspaper=BBC News |location=Scotland |date= 15 May 2015|access-date=28 May 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legislation ==

Once the Smith Commission's recommendations had been published they were debated in the UK Parliament and a [[command paper]] was published in January 2015 putting forward draft legislative proposals. A Scottish Parliament committee report published in May 2015 said that the draft bill proposed in January 2015 did not meet the recommendations of the Smith Commission, specifically in relation to welfare payments. A spokesman for the UK Government said that a full Parliamentary discussion would follow.&lt;ref name = "SP committee"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-32731463 |title=Holyrood powers bill 'falls short' of Smith proposals |work=BBC News |publisher=BBC |date=14 May 2015 |accessdate=14 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A bill based on the Smith Commission's recommendations was announced by the UK government in the May 2015 [[Queen's Speech]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Scottish devolution: What next for Scotland? |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-32810553 |newspaper=BBC News |location=Scotland |date=27 May 2015 |access-date=28 May 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill subsequently became law as the [[Scotland Act 2016]] in March 2016.

'''Société des auteurs, compositeurs et éditeurs de musique''' ('''SACEM''') is a [[France|French]] [[professional association]] collecting payments of artists’ rights and distributing the [[copyright|right]]s to the original [[songwriter]]s, [[composer]]s, and [[Music publisher (popular music)|music publisher]]s.

==History==
Composers [[Ernest Bourget]], [[Victor Parizot]] and [[Paul Henrion]] in Paris in 1847 (see [[1847 in music]]) succeeded in having payment made for their works which were being played in the leading café-concert at the time, [[Les Ambassadeurs (restaurant)|Les Ambassadeurs]]. The French courts recognized these legitimate rights founded in revolutionary laws. The provisional union of authors, composers and publishers of music was thus established in 1850, and one year later, the professional union became a society (société civile) of authors, composers, and publishers who divided the author’s rights collected amongst the members, and this rule has been maintained to the present day.

Various '''sources of sharia''' are used by [[Fiqh|Islamic jurisprudence]] to [[elucidate]] the body of [[Islamic]] law.&lt;ref name="Jurisprudence"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.al-islam.org/jurisprudence/ |title=Jurisprudence and its Principles |accessdate=2008-07-26 |last=Mutahhari |first=Morteza |authorlink=Morteza Motahhari |publisher=Tahrike Tarsile Qur'an}}&lt;/ref&gt; The primary source accepted universally by all [[Muslims]] is the [[Qur'an]], the majority adhering also to the traditionally reported [[Sunnah]], but rejected by others; [[Quranism]]. The Qur'an is the [[holy scripture]] of Islam, believed by Muslims to be the direct and unaltered word of [[God in Islam|God]]. The Sunnah consists of the alleged religious actions and [[Hadith|quotations]] of the [[Islamic prophet]] [[Muhammad]], narrated through his [[Sahabah|Companions]] and the [[Imams]] (per the beliefs of the Sunni and Shi'ite schools respectively).&lt;ref name="Jurisprudence"/&gt;

As Islamic regulations stated in the primary sources do not explicitly deal with every conceivable eventuality, jurisprudence must refer to resources and authentic documents to find the correct course of action.&lt;ref name="Jurisprudence"/&gt; According to [[Sunni]] schools of law, secondary sources of Islamic law are [[Ijma|consensus]], the exact nature of which bears no consensus itself; [[Qiyas|analogical reason]]; pure reason; [[Istislah|seeking]] the [[Maslaha|public interest]]; [[Istihsan|juristic discretion]]; the [[Fatwā|rulings]] of the [[Sahabah|first generation]] of Muslims; and [[urf|local customs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/law/shariahintroduction.html |title=Shari`ah and Fiqh |accessdate=2008-07-26 |work=USC-MSA Compendium of Muslim Texts |publisher=University of Southern California |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080918043205/http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/law/shariahintroduction.html |archivedate=18 September 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hanafi]] school frequently relies on analogical deduction and independent reasoning, and [[Maliki]] and [[Hanbali]] generally use the [[Hadith]] instead. [[Shafi'i]] school uses Sunnah more than Hanafi and analogy more than two others.&lt;ref name="Jurisprudence"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ijtihad"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.al-islam.org/al-tawhid/ijtihad-legislation.htm |title=The Role of Ijtihad in Legislation |accessdate=2008-07-26 |last=Motahhari |first=Morteza |authorlink=Morteza Motahhari |publisher=Al-Tawhid}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among [[Shia]], [[Usuli]] school of [[Ja'fari jurisprudence]] uses four sources, which are Qur'an, Sunnah, consensus and the [['aql|intellect]]. They use consensus under special conditions and rely on the intellect to find general principles based on the Qur'an and Sunnah, and use the [[usul al-fiqh|principles of jurisprudence]] as a methodology to interpret the Qur'an and Sunnah in different circumstances. [[Akhbari]] Ja'faris rely more on tradition and reject [[ijtihad]].&lt;ref name="Jurisprudence"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Momen (1985), p.185–187 and 223–234&lt;/ref&gt; According to Momen, despite considerable differences in the principles of jurisprudence between Shia and the four Sunni schools of law, there are fewer differences in the practical application of jurisprudence to ritual observances and social transactions.&lt;ref&gt;Momen (1985), p.188&lt;/ref&gt;

==Primary sources==

=== Qur’an ===
{{further|Wikisource:Legislation Verses Of Quran}}
[[File:Opened Qur'an.jpg|thumb|right|A copy of the Qur'an, one of the primary sources of sharia.]]

The Qur'an is the first and most important source of Islamic law. Believed to be the direct word of God as revealed to Muhammad through angel [[Jibril|Gabriel]] in [[Mecca]] and [[Medina]], the scripture specifies the moral, philosophical, social, political and [[Islamic economics|economic]] basis on which a society should be constructed. The verses revealed in Mecca deal with [[Islamic philosophy|philosophical]] and [[Islamic theology|theological]] issues, whereas those revealed in Medina are concerned with socio-economic laws. The Qur'an was written and preserved during the life of Muhammad, and compiled soon after his death.&lt;ref name=NomaniQ/&gt;

The verses of the Qur'an are categorized into three fields: "science of speculative theology", "[[Islamic ethics|ethical principles]]" and "rules of human conduct". The third category is directly concerned with Islamic legal matters which contains about five hundred verses or one thirteenth of it. The task of interpreting the Qur'an has led to various opinions and judgments. The interpretations of the verses by Muhammad's companions for Sunnis and [[Shia Imams|Imams]] for Shias are considered the most authentic, since they knew why, where and on what occasion each verse was revealed.&lt;ref name="Jurisprudence"/&gt;&lt;ref name=NomaniQ&gt;Nomani and Rahnema (1994), p. 3–4&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sunnah ===
The Sunnah is the next important source, and is commonly defined as "the traditions and customs of Muhammad" or "the words, actions and silent assertions of him". It includes the everyday sayings and utterances of Muhammad, his acts, his tacit consent, and acknowledgments of statements and activities. According to [[Shi'ite]] jurists, the sunnah also includes the words, deeds and acknowledgments of the [[Imamah (Shi'a twelver doctrine)|twelve Imams]] and [[Fatimah]], Muhammad's daughter, who are believed to be [[The Fourteen Infallibles|infallible]].&lt;ref name="Jurisprudence"/&gt;&lt;ref name=NomaniH&gt;Nomani and Rahnema (1994), p. 4–7&lt;/ref&gt;

Justification for using the Sunnah as a source of law can be found in the Qur'an. The Qur'an commands Muslims to follow Muhammad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|59|7|style=ref}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his lifetime, Muhammad made it clear that his traditions (along with the Qur'an) should be followed after his death.&lt;ref&gt;Qadri (1986), p. 191&lt;/ref&gt; The overwhelming majority of Muslims consider the sunnah to be essential supplements to and clarifications of the [[Qur'an]]. In Islamic jurisprudence, the Qur'an contains many rules for the behavior expected of Muslims but there are no specific Qur'anic rules on many religious and practical matters. Muslims believe that they can look at the way of life, or ''[[sunnah]]'', of Muhammad and his companions to discover what to imitate and what to avoid.

Much of the sunnah is recorded in the [[Hadith]]. Initially, Muhammad had instructed his followers not to write down his acts, so they may not confuse it with the Qur'an. However, he did ask his followers to disseminate his sayings orally. As long as he was alive, any doubtful record could be confirmed as true or false by simply asking him. His death, however, gave rise to confusion over Muhammad's conduct. Thus the Hadith were established.&lt;ref name=NomaniH/&gt; Due to problems of authenticity, the [[Science of hadith|science of Hadith]] (Arabic: `Ulum al-hadith) is established. It is a method of textual criticism developed by early Muslim scholars in determining the veracity of reports attributed to Muhammad. This is achieved by analyzing the text of the report, the scale of the report's transmission, the routes through which the report was transmitted, and the individual narrators involved in its transmission. On the basis of these criteria, various Hadith classifications developed.&lt;ref name="H-EoI"&gt;"Hadith", ''Encyclopedia of Islam.''&lt;/ref&gt;

To establish the authenticity of a particular Hadith or report, it had to be checked by following the chain of transmission (''[[isnad]]''). Thus the reporters had to cite their reference, and their reference's reference all the way back to Muhammad. All the references in the chain had to have a reputation for honesty and possessing a good retentive memory.&lt;ref name=NomaniH/&gt;  Thus biographical analysis (''[[Ilm ar-Rijal|`ilm al-rijāl]]'', lit. "science of people"), which contains details about the transmitter are scrutinized. This includes analyzing their date and place of birth; familial connections; teachers and students; religiosity; moral behaviour; literary output; their travels; as well as their date of death. Based upon these criteria, the reliability (''thiqāt'') of the transmitter is assessed. Also determined is whether the individual was actually able to transmit the report, which is deduced from their contemporaneity and geographical proximity with the other transmitters in the chain.&lt;ref&gt;Berg (2000) p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of biographical dictionaries include [[Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani]]'s "''[[Tahdhib al-Tahdhib (Asqalani)|Tahdhīb al-Tahdhīb]]''" or [[al-Dhahabi]]'s "''[[Tadhkirat al-huffaz|Tadhkirat al-huffāz]]''."&lt;ref&gt;See:
*Robinson (2003) pp. 69–70;
*Lucas (2004) p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

Using this criterion, Hadith are classified into three categories:&lt;ref name=NomaniH/&gt;
#Undubitable (''[[mutawatir]]''), which are very widely known, and backed up by numerous references.
#Widespread (''mashhur''), which are widely known, but backed up with few original references.
#Isolated or Single (''wahid''), which are backed up by too few and often discontinuous references.

in a shariah court a qadi (judge ) hears a case, including witnesses and evidence . then the qadi makes a ruling . sometimes the qadi consults a mufti or scholar of law, for an opinion.

==Secondary sources==
All medieval Muslim jurists rejected arbitrary opinion, and instead developed various secondary sources, also known as juristic principles or doctrines{{Clarify|date=September 2008}}, to follow in case the primary sources (i.e. the Qur'an and Sunnah) are silent on the issue.&lt;ref&gt;Makdisi, John (1985). "Legal Logic and Equity in Islamic Law", The American Journal of Comparative Law, '''33''' (1): 63-92&lt;/ref&gt;

===Consensus===
{{main|Ijma}}
The ''ijma' '', or [[consensus]] amongst Muslim jurists on a particular legal issue, constitutes the third source of Islamic law. Muslim jurists provide many [[Ayah|verses]] of the Qur'an that legitimize ''ijma' '' as a source of legislation.&lt;ref name= Mahmasani&gt;Mahmasani, S. ''Falsafe-e Ghanoongozari dar Eslam''. Tehran: Amir Kabir. pg. 143&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Verses {{cite quran|2|143|style=ref}}, {{cite quran|3|103|style=ref}}, {{cite quran|3|110|style=ref}}, {{cite quran|4|59|style=ref}}, {{cite quran|4|115|style=ref}} and {{cite quran|9|119|style=ref}} are presented by Mahmasani.&lt;/ref&gt; Muhammad himself said:
*"My followers will never agree upon an error or what is wrong",
*"God's hand is with the entire community".&lt;ref name = Mahmasani/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Muslehuddin, M. ''Philosophy of Islamic Law and the Orientalists''. New Delhi: Taj printers, 1986. pg.146&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--The principle of ''ijma' '' emerged as soon as Muhammad passed away. Its first notable application was the election of [[Abu Bakr]] as the [[Caliph]]. [[Sunnis]] often regard the election as proof of the effectiveness of ''ijma' ''.&lt;ref name =NomaniI&gt;Nomani and Rahnema (1994), p. 7-9&lt;/ref&gt;{{Clarify|date=September 2008}}--&gt;In history, it has been the most important factor in defining the meaning of the other sources and thus in formulating the doctrine and practice of the Muslim community.&lt;ref name = britIjma&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica, ''Ijma''.&lt;/ref&gt; This is so because ''ijma' '' represents the unanimous agreement of Muslims on a regulation or law at any given time.&lt;ref&gt;"Id̲j̲māʿ", ''Encyclopaedia of Islam''&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--Sunni Muslims regard ''ijma' '' as the third fundamental source of sharia law, after the divine revelation of the Qur'an, the prophetic practice or Sunnah. The analogical reasoning or qiyas is described as fourth source in Sunni Islam, whereas Shi'a Islam uses 'aql (intellect). Many conservative Muslim writers have claimed that the use of ''ijma' '' makes Islamic law compatible with [[democracy]].--&gt;

There are various views on ''ijma' '' among Muslims. Sunni jurists consider ''ijma' '' as a source, in matters of legislation, as important as the Qur'an and Sunnah. Shiite jurists, however, consider ''ijma' '' as source of secondary importance, and a source that is, unlike the Qur'an and Sunnah, not free from error.&lt;ref name=NomaniI&gt;Nomani and Rahnema (1994), p. 7–9&lt;/ref&gt; ''Ijma' '' was always used to refer to agreement reached in the past, either remote or near.&lt;ref name = britIjma/&gt; Amongst the Sunni jurists there is diversity on who is eligible to participate in ''ijma' '', as shown in the following table:

In modern Muslim usage it is no longer associated with traditional authority and appears as democratic institution and an instrument of reform.&lt;ref name= britIjma/&gt;

===Analogical reason===
{{main|Qiyas}}
''Qiyas'' or analogical reason is the fourth source of the [[sharia]] for the majority of [[Sunni]] jurisprudence. It aims to draw analogies to a previously accepted decision. [[Shiite]]s do not accept analogy, but replace it with reason (''[['Aql|aql]]''); among Sunnis, the [[Hanbali]]tes have traditionally been reluctant to accept analogy while the [[Zahiri]]tes don't accept it at all. Analogical reason in Islam is the process of legal deduction according to which the jurist, confronted with an unprecedented case, bases his or her argument on the logic used in the [[Qur'an]] and [[Sunnah]]. Legally sound analogy must not be based on arbitrary judgment, but rather be firmly rooted in the primary sources.&lt;ref name=NomaniQ1&gt;Nomani and Rahnema (1994), p. 9–12&lt;/ref&gt;

Supporters of the practice of ''qiyas'' will often point to passages in the Qur'an that describe an application of a similar process by past Islamic communities. According to supporters of the practice, Muhammad said: "Where there is no revealed injunction, I will judge amongst you according to reason."&lt;ref&gt;Mahmasani, S. ''Falsafe-e Ghanoongozari dar Eslam''. Tehran: Amir Kabir. pg. 140&lt;/ref&gt; Further, supporters claim that he extended the right to reason to others. Finally, supporters of the practice claim that it is sanctioned by the [[ijma]], or [[consensus]], amongst [[Sahaba|Muhammad's companions]].&lt;ref name=NomaniQ1/&gt; Islamic studies scholar [[Bernard G. Weiss]] has pointed out that while analogical reason was accepted as a fourth source of law by later generations, its validity was not a foregone conclusion among earlier Muslim jurists.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bernard G. Weiss]], ''The Search for God's Law: Islamic Jurisprudence in the Writings of Sayf al-Din al-Amidi'', pg. 633. [[Salt Lake City]]: [[University of Utah Press]], 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the issue of analogical reason and its validity was a controversial one early on, though the practice eventually gained acceptance of the majority of Sunni jurists.

The success and expansion of Islam brought it into contact with different cultures, societies and traditions, such as those of [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]] and [[Persia]]ns. With such contact, new problems emerged for Islamic law to tackle. Moreover, there was a significant distance between [[Medina]], the Islamic capital, and the Muslims on the periphery on the Islamic state. Thus far off jurists had to find novel Islamic solutions without the close supervision of the hub of Islamic law (back in Medina). During the [[Umayyad dynasty]], the concept of ''qiyas'' was abused by the rulers. The [[Abbasid]]s, who succeeded the Umayyads defined it more strictly, in an attempt to apply it more consistently.&lt;ref name=NomaniQ1/&gt;

The general principle behind the process of ''qiyas'' is based on the understanding that every legal injunction guarantees a beneficial and welfare satisfying objective. Thus, if the cause of an injunction can be deduced from the primary sources, then analogical deduction can be applied to cases with similar causes. For example, [[Islam and alcohol|wine is prohibited in Islam]] because of its intoxicating property. Thus ''qiyas'' leads to the conclusion that all [[intoxicant]]s are forbidden.&lt;ref name=NomaniQ1/&gt;

The [[Hanafi]] [[maddhab|school of thought]] very strongly supports ''qiyas''. [[Imam]] [[Abu Hanifa]], an important practitioner of ''qiyas'', elevated ''qiyas'' to a position of great significance in [[Islamic law]]. Abu Hanifa extended the rigid principle of basing rulings on the Qur'an and Sunnah to incorporate opinion and exercise of free thought by jurists. In order to respond suitably to emerging problems, he based his judgments, like other jurists, on the explicit meanings of primary texts (the Qur'an and sunnah). But, he also considered the "spirit" of Islamic teachings, as well as whether the ruling would be in the interest of the objectives of Islam. Such rulings were based on public interest and the welfare of the Muslim community.&lt;ref name=NomaniQ1/&gt;

{{Rquote|right|The knowledge of ours is an opinion, it is the best we have been able to achieve. He who is able to arrive at different conclusions is entitled to his own opinion as we are entitled to our own.|[[Abu Hanifa]]&lt;ref name=NomaniQ1/&gt;}}

The [[Shafi'i]] [[maddhab|school of thought]] accepts ''qiyas'' as a valid source. Imam Shafi'i, however, considered it a weak source, and tried to limit the cases where jurists would need to resort to ''qiyas''. He criticized and rejected analogical deductions that were not firmly rooted in the [[Qur'an]] and [[sunnah]]. According to [[Shafi'i]], if analogical deductions were not strictly rooted in primary sources, they would have adverse effects. One such consequence could be variety of different rulings in the same subject. Such a situation, he argued, would undermine the predictability and uniformity of a sound legal system.
&lt;ref name=NomaniQ2&gt;Nomani and Rahnema (1994), p. 13–15&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Imam Malik]] accepted ''qiyas'' as a valid source of legislation. For him, if a parallel could be established between the effective cause of a law in the primary sources and a new case, then analogical deduction could be viable tool. Malik, however, went beyond his adherence to "strict analogy" and proposed pronouncements on the basis of what jurists considered was "public good".&lt;ref name=NomaniQ2/&gt;

===Juristic preference===
{{main|istihsan}}
[[Abu Hanifa]] developed a new source known as juristic preference.&lt;ref name= britIstihsan&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica, ''Istihsan''&lt;/ref&gt; Juristic preference is defined as:
*A means to seek ease and convenience,
*To adopt tolerance and moderation,
*To over-rule analogical reason, if necessary.&lt;ref name= Histihsan/&gt;

The source, inspired by the principle of conscience, is a last resort if none of the widely accepted sources are applicable to a problem. It involves giving favor to rulings that dispel hardship and bring ease to people.&lt;ref name=NomaniQ2/&gt;  The doctrine was justified directly by the Qur'anic verse stating: "Allah desires you ease and good, not hardship".&lt;ref name=Histihsan&gt;Hasan (2004), p.157–160&lt;/ref&gt; Though its main adherents were Abu Hanifa and his pupils (such as Abu Yusuf), Malik and his students made use of it to some degree. The source was subject to extensive discussion and argumentation,&lt;ref&gt;Hallaq, "Considerations on the Function and Character of Sunnī Legal Theory".&lt;/ref&gt; and its opponents claimed that it often departs from the primary sources.&lt;ref name=NomaniQ2/&gt;

This doctrine was useful in the [[Islamic world]] outside the Middle East where the Muslims encountered environments and challenges they had been unfamiliar with in [[Arabia]].&lt;ref name=britIstihsan/&gt; One example of isthisan is cited as follows: If a well is [[Najis|contaminated]] it may not be used for ritual purification. Istihsan suggests that withdrawing a certain number of buckets of water from the well will remove the impurities. Analogical reason, however, dictates that despite removing some of the water, a small concentration of contaminants will always remain in the well (or the well walls) rendering the well impure. The application of analogy means the public may not use the well, and therefore causes hardship. Thus the principle of justistic preference is applied, and the public may use the well for ritual purification.&lt;ref name=Histihsan/&gt;

===Public interest===
Malik developed a tertiary source called ''[[Istislah|al-maslahah al-mursalah]]'', which means that which is in the best interests of the general public. According to this source of Islamic law, rulings can be pronounced in accordance with the "underlying meaning of the revealed text in the light of public interest". In this case, the [[Ulema|jurist]] uses his wisdom to pursue public interest. This source is rejected by the Shafi'ites, Hanbalites and Zahirites from Sunni jurisprudence.&lt;ref name=NomaniQ2/&gt;

===Inference===
Shafi'i accepted cases in which he had to be more flexible with the application of Qisas. Similar to Abu Hanifa and Malik, he developed a tertiary source of legislation. The Shafi'i school adopted ''istidlal'' or [[inference]], a process of seeking guidance from the source. Inference allowed the jurists to avoid strict analogy in a case where no clear precedent could be found. In this case, public interest was distinguished as a basis for [[legislation]].&lt;ref name=NomaniQ2/&gt;

Muslim scholars divided inference into three types. The first is the expression of the connection existing between one proposition and another without any specific effective cause. Next, inference could mean presumption that a state of things, which is not proved to have ceased, still continues. The final type of inference is the authority as to the revealed laws previous to Islam.&lt;ref&gt;Hodkinson, Keith. ''Muslim Family Law: A Sourcebook''. [[India]]: [[Routledge]], 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reason===
{{main|Ijtihad}}
[[Shi'ite]] jurists maintain that if a solution to a problem can not be found from the primary sources, then ''aql'' or reason should be given free rein to deduce a proper response from the primary sources. The process, whereby rational efforts are made by the jurist to arrive at an appropriate ruling, when applied is called ''ijtihad'' (literally meaning "exerting oneself"). Shi'ite jurists maintain that qiyas is a specific type of ijtihad. The Sunni Shafi' school of thought, however, holds that both qiyas and ijtihad are the same.&lt;ref name =NomaniIj&gt;Nomani and Rahnema (1994), p.15–16&lt;/ref&gt;

Sunni jurists accepted ijtihad as a mechanism for deducing rulings. They, however, announced an end to its practice during the thirteenth century. The reason for this was that centers of Islamic learning (such as [[Baghdad]], [[Nishapur]], and [[Bukhara]]) had fallen into the hands of the Mongols. Thus, the "doors to ijtihad", were closed.&lt;ref name=NomaniIj/&gt; In Sunni Islam, thus, ijtihad was replaced by ''taqlid'' or the acceptance of doctrines developed previously.&lt;ref name=IjtEI&gt;Ijtihad, ''Encyclopaedia of Islam''&lt;/ref&gt; Later in Sunni history, however, there were notable instances of jurists using reason to re-derive law from the first principles. One was [[Ibn Taymiyya]] (d. 728/1328), another was [[Averroes|Ibn Rus̲h̲d]] (Averroes d. 595/1198).&lt;ref name = IjtEI/&gt;

There are many justifications, found in the Qur'an and sunnah, for the use of ijtihad. For example, during a conversation with Mu'ādh ibn Jabal, Muhammad asked the former how he would give judgments. Mu'ādh replied that he would refer first to the Qur'an, then to the Sunnah and finally commit to ijtihad to make his own judgment. Muhammad approved of this.&lt;ref&gt;ʻAlwānī (1973), p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

A lawyer who is qualified to use this source is called a ''mujtahid''. The founders of the Sunni [[madhab]]s (schools of law) were considered such lawyers. All ''mujtahid'' exercise at the same time the powers of a ''[[mufti]]'' and can give ''[[fatwa]]''. Some ''mujtahid'' have claimed to be ''muj̲addid'', or "renewer of religion." Such persons are thought to appear in every century. In Shi'ite Islam they are regarded as the spokespersons of the hidden Imam.&lt;ref name=IjtEI/&gt;

===Local custom===
{{main|Urf}}

The term urf, meaning "to know", refers to the customs and practices of a given society. Although this was not formally included in Islamic law,&lt;ref name=UrfEI&gt;"Urf", ''Encyclopaedia of Islam''&lt;/ref&gt; the sharia recognizes customs that prevailed at the time of Muhammad but were not abrogated by the Qur'an or the tradition (called "Divine silence"). Practices later innovated are also justified, since Islamic tradition says what the people, in general, consider good is also considered as such by [[Allah|God]]. According to some sources, urf holds as much authority as ijma (consensus), and more than qiyas (analogical deduction). Urf is the Islamic equivalent of "[[common law]]".&lt;ref name = Urf&gt;Hasan (2004), p. 169–71&lt;/ref&gt;

Local custom was first recognized by Abū Yūsuf (d. 182/798), an early leader of the Ḥanafī school. However, it was considered part of the Sunnah, and not as formal source. Later, al-Sarak̲h̲sī (d. 483/1090) opposed it, holding that custom cannot prevail over a written text.&lt;ref name=UrfEI/&gt;

According to Sunni jurisprudence, in the application of local custom, custom that is accepted into law should be commonly prevalent in the region, not merely in an isolated locality. If it is in absolute opposition to Islamic texts, custom is disregarded. However, if it is in opposition to analogical reason, custom is given preference. Jurists also tend to, with caution, give precedence to custom over doctoral opinions of highly esteemed scholars.&lt;ref name=Urf/&gt; Shi'ite scholars do not consider custom as a source of jurisprudence, nor do the Hanbalite or Zahirite schools of Sunni jurisprudence.

A '''tax advisor''' or '''tax consultant''' is a person with advanced training and knowledge of [[tax law]]. The services of a tax advisor are usually retained in order to minimize taxation while remaining compliant with the law in complicated financial situations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/taxadvisor.asp|title=Tax Advisor Definition|publisher=Investopedia|accessdate=10 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tax Advisors are also retained to represent clients before tax authorities and tax courts to resolve tax issues.

==World==
===Austria===
In [[Austria]], Steuerberater is the professional license for tax advisors.

===Germany===
{{See also|Steuerberater}}
In [[Germany]], Steuerberater is the professional license for tax advisors.&lt;ref name=bstbk&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bstbk.de/de/index.html|title=Bundessteuerberaterkammer|publisher=Bundessteuerberaterkammer|language=German|accessdate=10 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Italy===
In [[Italy]], tax advisors are called ''commercialisti'', and provide assistance on [[business management]], [[business law]], [[economics]], [[finance]], tax, [[accounting]], commercial, corporate and administrative matters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/growth/tools-databases/regprof/index.cfm?action=regprof&amp;id_regprof=18165&amp;cookies=disabled|title=Dottore commercialista (Italy)|publisher=[[European Commission]]|access-date=19 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Treccani, [http://www.treccani.it/vocabolario/commercialista/ commercialista]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Dottori commercialisti'', who have a degree in [[economics]], and ''ragionieri commercialisti'', who have a [[diploma]] from an ''[[istituto tecnico economico]]'', were members of two different [[Professional Order|professional orders]], but they were merged in 2008 and it is now impossible to become a ''commercialista'' without a ''[[Laurea#Second cycle: Laurea Magistrale|laurea magistrale]]''. ''Esperti contabili'', whose roles are similar to those of a ''commercialista'', must have a ''[[Laurea#First cycle: Laurea|laurea]]'', a first cycle degree that is equivalent to a [[bachelor's degree]]. According to the Italian law, the following activities are some of the roles of a ''commercialista'':
* the administration and liquidation of companies and assets;
* surveys and technical advice;
* inspections and administrative reviews;
* verifications and investigations regarding the reliability of [[financial statements]], [[financial accounts|accounts]] and records of a [[company]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lavoroeformazione.it/1/lavoro/il-dottore-commercialista-,138|title=Il dottore commercialista|publisher=lavoroeformazione.it|language=Italian|access-date=19 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unive.it/pag/10159/|title=Dottore commercialista, Esperto contabile, Revisore legale|publisher=[[Ca' Foscari University of Venice]]|language=Italian|access-date=19 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elenco-commercialisti.it/dottore-commercialista.html|title=Dottore commercialista e ragioniere commercialista|publisher=ItaliaWeb Srl|language=Italian||access-date=19 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Japan===
In [[Japan]], there is a specific license for tax advisors called {{nihongo|'''certified public tax accountant'''|税理士|zeirishi}}. In order to obtain this qualification, an individual must pass a special state examination, or already be qualified as an [[attorney at law (Japan)|attorney at law]] or [[certified public accountant]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nichizeiren.or.jp/eng/index.html Japan Federation of Certified Public Tax Accountants' Organizations]&lt;/ref&gt;

===South Korea===
In [[South Korea]], there is a specific license for tax advisors called '''certified tax accountant'''. In order to obtain this qualification, an individual must pass a special examination.

===United Kingdom===
In the [[United Kingdom|UK]], guidelines concerning professional conduct in relation to taxation are published in conjunction with the [[Chartered Institute of Taxation]], the [[Association of Taxation Technicians]], the [[Institute of Indirect Taxation]], the [[Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales]], the [[Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland]] and the [[Association of Chartered Certified Accountants]]. These were prepared for the assistance of members of the various associations both generally in dealing with clients and the tax authorities and specifically in relation to irregularities and errors. 

The guidelines, which include practical advice about a range of legal and ethical issues, are summarised as:

* A member's primary duty is to ensure that his actions comply with the law. He/she owes a contractual duty to the client to act for him/her with the requisite degree of skill and care, and the contractual relationship should be governed by a letter of engagement. The member also has duties to the tax authorities, notably of compliance with the law and the honest presentation of his client's circumstances.
* It is the taxpayer's responsibility to ensure that returns made to the tax authorities are correct and complete. It is for the member to assist him to decide on the extent and manner of disclosure of facts in relation to his tax affairs.
*Where a member becomes aware that irregularities have occurred in relation to a client's tax affairs he should advise the client of the consequences, and the manner of disclosure. If necessary, appropriate specialist advice should be taken.
* Where a client refuses to follow the advice of a member in relation to issues involving disclosure, the member should consider whether he should continue to act. If appropriate, specialist advice should be taken.
* If mistakes are made by the tax authorities there may be a need, and in some cases a duty, on the part of the client and sometimes the member, to put matters right.
* Members may have statutory duties of disclosure where they have suspicions of criminal activity.
* When approached for information on a client's affairs by another adviser the member should ensure that he has his client's authority before making any disclosure.

===United States===
In the United States, paid tax return preparers are regulated but not licensed by the [[Internal Revenue Service]] of the [[United States Department of the Treasury]]. There are penalties for failure to disclose the identity of the preparer on the return, for the failure to give the taxpayer a copy of the return, and for negligence in preparing the return.

Practice before the Internal Revenue Service is regulated by [[Circular 230|''Treasury Department Circular No. 230'']], ''Regulations Governing the Practice of Attorneys, Certified Public Accountants, Enrolled Agents, Enrolled Actuaries, and Appraisers before the Internal Revenue Service''.&lt;ref&gt;Codified in regulations at 31 C.F.R. subtitle A, part 10.&lt;/ref&gt; Most practice is limited to [[Attorney at law (United States)|attorneys]], [[Certified Public Accountant]]s (CPAs), [[enrolled agent]]s, and [[enrolled actuary|enrolled actuaries]]. Rendering tax advice is also regulated by [[Circular 230]].

Failure to uphold these standards can result in disciplinary action ranging from reprimand to permanent disbarrment from practice.

In the United States, the term "tax professional" is a generic term describing a variety of professions including enrolled agents, Certified Public Accountants (CPAs), [[financial planner]]s, [[accountant]]s, [[tax preparer]]s, and some [[lawyer]]s.

In the United States, by far the largest segment of tax professionals are individual tax preparers.

[[File:EC tyre label CA.svg|thumb|EU Tyre Label]]
The '''Tyre Label''' is a mark for motor vehicle [[tyres]]. Manufacturers of [[tyres]] for cars, light and heavy trucks must specify [[fuel consumption]], wet grip and noise classification of every tyre sold in EU market starting in November 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etrma.org/tyres/tyre-labelling]&lt;/ref&gt; 
For passenger car, light truck and truck tyres the information must be available in technical promotional literature (leaflets, brochures, etc.), including the manufacturer website 
For passenger and light truck tyres, the manufacturers or importers have the choice of either putting a sticker on the tyre tread or a label accompanying each delivery of batch of tyres to the dealer and to the end consumer
The tyre label will use a classification from the best (green category "A") to the worst performance (red category "G").

This initiative results from a regulation by the EU Commission released in 2009. It is part of the Energy Efficiency Action Plan, designed to improve the energy performance of products, buildings and services to reduce energy consumption by 20% until 2020. The EU has already created a system for marking of electrical household appliances such as refrigerators, washing machines and televisions with the intent to inform the European population better about the level of their consumption.

(Source: European Commission)

== Rolling resistance ==

Rolling resistance is the main key factor in measuring the energy efficiency of a tyre and has direct influence on the fuel consumption of a vehicle. A set of tyres of the green class "A" compared to a "G" class can reduce fuel consumption by 9%&lt;ref&gt;https://ec.europa.eu/energy/sites/ener/files/documents/FIN%20User%20guide%20-%20tyres.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; of a passenger car; even more for trucks.

'D' Grading is not used in rolling resistance grading for Passenger Cars and Light Trucks while it is used for Heavy Trucks

== Wet grip ==

Basis for wet grip is the absolute stopping distance when driving 80&amp;nbsp;km per hour. Between each class, there are 3–6 metres difference in braking distance. Classes "D" and "G" are not used.

== Noise emission ==

The driving by noise is quoted as an absolute value in decibel and as a 3 classes sound wave symbol. A continuous sound level above 80 decibel can cause health problems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.testsieger-reifen.de/news/das-neue-eu-reifenlabel/ German article on the tyre label] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120301214734/http://www.testsieger-reifen.de/news/das-neue-eu-reifenlabel/ |date=1 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tyres that must be labeled ==

=== The Tyre Label will generally apply to ===
* Car and SUV tyres
* Van tyres
* Truck tyres

=== Exceptions from labelling ===

* Tyres for cars made before 1 Oct 1990.&lt;ref name=eu&gt;[http://www.fleetfirst.eu/ff_home_en/news/eu-tire-label.jsp The New EU Tire Label - A step towards safer, more fuel-efficient tires]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Re-treaded tyres
* Motorcycle tyres
* Racing/sports car tyres
* Studded tyres
* Spare tyres
* Vintage car tyres
* Professional off-road tyres

== Tax on noisy tyres ==

Tyres that make too much [[roadway noise]] as determined by the EU, will have an extra tax/penalty imposed on them from November 2012.&lt;ref name="eu"/&gt;

== Reporting requirements ==

=== Tyre manufacturer ===
* For passenger car, light truck and truck tyres the information must be available in the technical promotional literature (leaflets, brochures, etc.), including the manufacturer website 
* For passenger and light truck tyres, the manufacturers or importers have the choice of either putting a sticker on the tyre tread or a label accompanying each delivery of batch of tyres to the dealer and to the end consumer

=== Tyre dealer ===
* Must ensure tyres which are visible to consumers at the point of sale carry a sticker or have a label in their close proximity which is shown to the end user before the sale 
* Must give the information during the purchase process when the tyres offered for sale are not visible to the end-user
* Must give the information on or with the bill

=== Car manufacturer ===
* Must declare the tyre wet grip and fuel efficiency class and external rolling noise measured value of the tyre type(s) that are offered in option, when different from those fitted normally on the basic vehicle.
* As soon as the customer is given a choice either in the size / type of tyres fitted on the basic rim or a choice of rim and tyre size, the labelling information must be provided before sale.
* There might be no obligation to provide information only in those cases where there is a choice of rim with tyres types and sizes that are strictly identical to those which are sold automatically with the new vehicle.

=== EU-Commission===
* Detailed information about contents and design of the label.
* Each EU member state is to organise monitoring and impose penalties in cases of non-compliance.

== Critical View ==

The new label is designed to show information regarding 3 criteria, however there are many other important performance factors to consider including:

* Resistance to [[aquaplaning]]
* Driving stability
* Handling and steering precision on wet and dry roads
* Durability
* Braking performance on dry roads
* Capabilities in winter conditions

Automotive manufacturers require the very highest standard across all these performance factors before they approve tyres for their new vehicles.
Furthermore, widely published tyre tests also take these performance factors into account and therefore continue to be an excellent source of independent information regarding the total performance of a tyre.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rezulteo-tyres.co.uk/tyre-label/the-label-doesnt-tell-the-whole-story-4740 "The label doesn't tell the whole story" Rezulteo tyres, Retrieved 7 Mars 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;
Tyres that make too much noise as determined by the EU, will have an extra tax/penalty imposed on them from November 2012.

== Driving Proviso ==

Actual fuel savings and road safety also depend heavily on the behaviour of drivers when using their cars, and in particular the following:

— Eco-driving can significantly reduce fuel consumption

— Tyre pressure should be regularly checked to optimise wet grip and fuel efficiency performance

— Stopping distances should always be strictly respected&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2009:342:0046:0058:EN:PDF]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21031">The '''Woodhead Commission''' (officially the '''Palestine Partition Commission'''&lt;ref name=Report&gt;''Palestine Partition Commission Report'', Command Paper 5854, Printed and published by His Majesty's Stationery Office, London, 1938 (310 pages and 13 maps)&lt;/ref&gt;) was a British technical commission established to propose "a detailed" partition scheme for [[Mandatory Palestine]], including recommending the partition boundaries and examination of economic and financial aspects of the [[Peel Plan]].&lt;ref name="Mandated Landscape"&gt;Mandated Landscape: British Imperial Rule in Palestine 1929-1948&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://unispal.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/0/BBBC9DD3AED1E0E2852570D20077E7DE Policy in Palestine, December 23, 1937]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Commission was appointed at the end of February 1938 and conducted its investigations from April to early August 1938.  It rejected the Peel Commission's plan mainly on the grounds that it required a large transfer of Arabs, and considered two other plans.  It preferred a modification of the partition, which forms a satisfactory basis of settlement, if the [[United Kingdom]] government accept "the very considerable financial liability involved,"&lt;ref name="archive.jta.org"/&gt; that balances the Arab state budget.&lt;ref name="WoodheadReport1938"/&gt; In this plan, the entire Galilee and a corridor from Jaffa to Jerusalem would remain under British mandate.

It published its conclusions on November 9, 1938, after which the British government rejected the imminent partition of Palestine as involving insurmountable "political, administrative and financial difficulties".&lt;ref name="MajestyStatement"/&gt; Britain called for a [[London Conference (1939)|conference in London]] for all relevant parties to work out a compromise.

==Overview==
The Arabs renewed their revolt after the publication of the [[Peel Commission]] report and the [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|British Cabinet]], taking fright, secretly voted against partition on 8 December 1937. The Woodhead commission was appointed with a formal duty of implementation of the  Peel proposals but in reality to bury them.&lt;ref name="Morris2004p49"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Galnoor2012p53"/&gt; The Commission comprised Sir John Woodhead, a former civil administrator in India; Sir Alison Russell, a lawyer; Percival Waterfield and Thomas Reid, also Indian civil servants.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.il/books?id=xZD_ZswA-VgC&amp;pg=PA162&amp;lpg=PA162&amp;dq=reid+woodhead+commission&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=BGlUCuKOE-&amp;sig=8BB0E9_e91IojPCBWa-OGiDD6c8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=c4IdT6D0Lcj98QP9sNSnBQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=reid%20woodhead%20commission&amp;f=false Conservative Party Attitudes to Jews, 1900-1950, Harry Defries]&lt;/ref&gt; It was charged with examining the [[Peel Commission]] plan in detail, in order "to recommend boundaries for the proposed Arab and Jewish areas and the enclaves to be retained permanently or temporarily under British Mandate" and "to examine and report on the economic and financial questions involved in partition upon which decisions will require to be taken."&lt;ref&gt;Report, p, 7&lt;/ref&gt; However, the appointment of the Commission was regarded by the Colonial Office as an instrument to free Britain from its obligation to the partition plan.&lt;ref&gt;''Palestine: Retreat from the Mandate: The Making of British Policy, 1936-1945'', Michael J. Cohen, pp. 44-45&lt;/ref&gt; In accordance with a decision of the British cabinet, Woodhead was secretly advised that it was within the commission's authority to decide that "no workable scheme could be produced".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Itzhak Galnoor | title = The Partition of Palestine: Decision Crossroads in the Zionist Movement | page = 53 | publisher = State University of New York Press | place = Albany | year = 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sir George Rendel, head of the Eastern Department of the Foreign Office, did his utmost to ensure that the  Commission would reach the "correct conclusion," by trying to influence the choice of personnel and placing his own memorandum before the Commission as evidence.&lt;ref&gt;''Palestine: Retreat from the Mandate: The Making of British Policy, 1936-1945'', Michael J. Cohen, pp. 46-47&lt;/ref&gt;

The Commission spent over three months in Palestine, taking evidence from witnesses in 55 sessions. No Arabs came forward to submit evidence, though king [[Abdullah I of Jordan|Abdullah]] of Transjordan wrote to Woodhead giving support for partition as well as receiving the Commission in Amman.&lt;ref&gt;Report, pp. 8–9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Yoav Gelber | title = Jewish-Transdanian Relations 1921–1948 | publisher = Frank Cass | year = 1997 | pages = 134–135}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Commission found that a self-supporting Arab State could only be established if it "contained a large number of Jews, whose contributions to tax-revenue would alone enabled that state to balance its budget."&lt;ref&gt;Report, p196.&lt;/ref&gt; As the  Arab State would need the mandated territories for farming and the Jewish State would need them for industry, the Commission proposed a customs union.&lt;ref name="archive.jta.org"&gt;[http://archive.jta.org/article/1938/11/10/2844036/britain-drops-partition-maps-peace-parleys-agency-rejects-woodhead-report-as-talks-basis Britain Drops Partition, Maps Peace Parleys; Agency Rejects Woodhead Report As Talks Basis]&lt;/ref&gt;

In their report, they examined three possible modifications of the Peel Commission [[:FIle:PeelMap.png|proposal]], which they called Plans A, B and C. These plans proposed the creation of a Jewish state surrounded by a larger Arab state and a British zone.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wymaninstitute.org/articles/2008-11-kristallnacht.php David Ben-Gurion’s Answer to Kristallnacht]&lt;/ref&gt; The three plans are as follows:

===Plan A===
[[File:WoodheadMapA.png|thumb|Woodhead Commission, Plan A]]
Plan A, was based on the [[Peel Plan]], with the boundaries redrawn "more exactly, taking their outline as a guide".&lt;ref&gt;Report, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; It proposed a coastal Jewish state, a British-mandated corridor from Jerusalem to the coastal city Jaffa, and the remainder of Palestine merged with [[Emirate of Transjordan|Transjordan]] into an Arab state.&lt;ref name="archive.jta.org"/&gt; Jaffa (without Tel Aviv) was included in the mandated corridor in the Peel Plan but in the Arab state in Plan A.&lt;ref&gt;Report, pp. 40–44, maps 3, 8.&lt;/ref&gt;
Under Plan A, it was estimated that the Arab state would have 7,200 Jews and 485,200 Arabs, and the Jewish state would have 304,900 Jews and 294,700 Arabs.&lt;ref&gt;Report, p. 81&lt;/ref&gt;

===Plan B===
[[File:WoodheadMapB.png|thumb|Woodhead Commission, Plan B]]
Plan B, same as Plan A, except that it reduced the size of the Jewish State by adding [[Galilee]] to the permanently mandated area and the southern part of the region south of [[Jaffa]] to the Arab State.&lt;ref name="avalon"&gt;[http://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/angap04.asp Anglo-American Committee of Inquiry - Appendix IV]&lt;/ref&gt;
Under Plan B, the Jewish state would have 300,400 Jews and 188,400 Arabs (50,000 in the [[Haifa]] district), while 90,000 Arabs and 76,000 Jews would continue to live under British rule.&lt;ref&gt;''The Arab-Israeli Conflict: Its History in Maps'', Martin Gilbert, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;

===Plan C===
[[File:WoodheadMapC.png|thumb|Woodhead Commission, Plan C]]
Plan C, a further modification, would reduce the Jewish State to the coastal region between [[Zikhron Yaakov]] and [[Rehovot]], while placing northern Palestine, including the [[Jezreel Valley]], and all the semi-arid part of southern Palestine, under a separate mandate&lt;ref name=avalon/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Palestine: Retreat from the Mandate: The Making of British Policy, 1936-1945'', Michael J. Cohen, p. 72&lt;/ref&gt; to be administered by the mandatory until the Arab and Jewish populations could agree on their final destination. An essential feature of the plan was a ''customs union'' of the Arab State, the Jewish State and the territories under Mandate.

Plan C recommended:&lt;ref&gt;Report, p. 109 and Map 10&lt;/ref&gt;

* A Jewish state of 1,258 square km, in two parts:  The northern part would be a coastal strip 15–20&amp;nbsp;km wide from Tel Aviv to above [[Zichron Ya'acov]], and the southern part would be a smaller region including [[Rehovot]].  The initial population would be about 226,000 Jews and 54,400 Arabs.
* An Arab state of 7,393 square km, consisting mostly of a segment approximating today's West Bank and Gaza Strip with a wide corridor connecting them.  The Arab state would also include the city of [[Jaffa]]. The initial population would be 8,900 Jews and 444,100 Arabs.
* Three mandated territories under British control: all of the Galilee (initial population 77,300 Jews and 231,400 Arabs), an enclave including [[Jerusalem]] and [[Lydda]] (initial population 80,100 Jews and 211,400 Arabs), and the Negev region from north of [[Beersheva]] (initially 60,000 Arabs).

==Conclusions==
The commission report was published on 9, November 1938, concluded that no plan of partition could be evolved within the terms of reference which would, in the view of the members of the Commission, offer much hope of success,&lt;ref name="avalon"/&gt; for eventual establishment of self-supporting Arab and Jewish states.&lt;ref name="archive.jta.org"/&gt; However, the commission devised possible alternative plans.

The commission rejected '''Plan A''', which was the Commission's interpretation of the Peel Plan, mainly on the grounds that it required a large transfer of Arabs to reduce the number of Arabs in the proposed Jewish state.&lt;ref&gt;Report, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; However, the British government had already rejected Peel's suggestion that the transfer be compulsory, and the Commission considered that a voluntary transfer was also not expected to occur because of the Arab population's "deep attachment to the land".&lt;ref&gt;Report, pp. 52–83.&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, development difficulties for the Arabs were expected.&lt;ref name="Mandated Landscape"/&gt; Second, the inclusion of Galilee in the Jewish state was considered undesirable as "the population is almost entirely Arab", the Arabs living there were likely to resist the inclusion by force, and the option would create a "minority problem" that threatened regional stability.&lt;ref name=planAreject&gt;Report, pp. 96–97&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Plan B''' was rejected but one member favored  it. The problem of Galilee was considered fatal to Plan B.&lt;ref name=planBreject&gt;Report, pp. 97–98&lt;/ref&gt; Including it in the Arab state would create a major security problem for the Jewish state, while keeping it indefinitely under mandate would deprive the large Arab population of its right to independence.&lt;ref name=planBreject/&gt; Major problems were also seen with the disposition of Haifa, whose population was approximately half Jewish, and the part of Palestine running from Haifa to Beisan and then north to the frontier.&lt;ref name=planBreject/&gt;

'''Plan C''' was preferred by the commission. This plan was a modification of the partition, which would form a satisfactory basis of settlement, if the [[United Kingdom]] was prepared to provide a sufficient assistance to enable the Arab State to balance its budget.&lt;ref name="WoodheadReport1938"/&gt; In this plan, the entire Galilee and a corridor from Jaffa to Jerusalem would remain under British mandate.

Two members of the Commission also added Notes of Reservation.  Russell argued that Plan B was preferred to Plan C, being more in accord with the Peel Commission's plan, more likely to secure peace, and more equitable and practical.&lt;ref&gt;Report, pp. 249–262.&lt;/ref&gt; Reid argued that all three plans were fatally flawed.&lt;ref&gt;Report, pp. 263–281&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economy and finance===
The Commission also declared that there were financial and economic difficulties "of such a nature that we can find no possible way to overcome them within our terms of reference."&lt;ref name=report246&gt;Report, p.246&lt;/ref&gt; It found that "it is not possible, under our terms of reference, to recommend boundaries which will afford a reasonable prospect of the eventual establishment of a self-supporting Arab State. This conclusion is, in our opinion, equally valid under plan C, plan B, and any other plan of partition which does not involve the inclusion in the Arab State of an area containing a large number of Jews, whose contributions to tax-revenue would alone enable that state to balance its budget".&lt;ref&gt;report, p. 196&lt;/ref&gt;  They suggested that the Arab and Jewish states not be given fiscal independence but instead the UK government accept "the very considerable financial liability"&lt;ref name=report246/&gt;{{Elucidate|date=December 2014}} and provide a sufficient assistance to enable the Arab State to balance its budget.&lt;ref name="WoodheadReport1938"/&gt;

In a published summary his findings, Woodhead identified two reasons for the financial infeasibility of an Arab state.&lt;ref name=WoodheadIA&gt;{{cite journal | author = John Woodhead | title = The Report of the Palestine Partition Commission | journal = International Affairs | volume = 18 | year = 1939 | pages = 171–193 | doi=10.2307/3019878}}&lt;/ref&gt;  First, Jewish citizens of Palestine made much higher ''per capita'' tax contribution than Arabs, yet any feasible partition would leave few Jews in the Arab state.&lt;ref name=WoodheadIA/&gt;  Second, the greater part of the Arab wealth lay in the places that would become part of the Jewish state due to their large Jewish populations.&lt;ref name=WoodheadIA/&gt; For example, although Arabs and Jews had about the same amount of land under citrus cultivation, less than one third of the Arab holding would be in the Arab state."&lt;ref name=WoodheadIA/&gt;

The Commission proposed a modified form of partition called "economic federalism" in which the two states would enter into a customs union with the territories that remained under mandate, leaving the Mandatory authorities to determine a fiscal policy. According to the report: "The customs revenue would be collected by the Mandatory, and the net surplus after meeting certain common charges would be distributed between the three areas according to an agreed formula, subject to periodic review...The Commission suggest that initially each area's share should be one-third...To enable the Arab State to balance its budget without subjecting it to external financial control, it should receive a supplementary share out of the share of the mandated territories, under conditions which will entitle it to share in the expansion of customs revenue resulting from an increase of prosperity in the rest of Palestine. This arrangement could be extended, if desired, to cover internal communications (railways, posts and telegraphs) thus removing certain obvious administrative difficulties consequent on partition. While this arrangement withholds fiscal autonomy from the Arab and Jewish states it seems to the Commission, subject to certain reservations, to form a satisfactory basis for settlement, provided his Majesty's Government are prepared to accept the considerable financial liability involved,"&lt;ref name="archive.jta.org"/&gt; in order to balance the Arab state budget.

==Criticism==
Former Colonial Secretary [[Leo Amery]] argued that partition had been rejected "for the wrong reasons." He said that the Peel Plan based its proposal on areas where "Jews and Arabs already preponderated," while fulfilling the Mandate required providing the Jews with sufficient territory for substantial immigration. The attempt of the Woodhead Commission to include the fewest number of Arabs in Jewish areas and vice versa led to plans that were not viable. Moreover, the implication was that a self-supporting Arab state must "continue to enjoy those amenities that Jewish enterprise and taxation had brought to undivided Palestine." According to Amery, no scheme could be implemented under such assumptions.&lt;ref&gt;''Palestine: Retreat from the Mandate: The Making of British Policy, 1936-1945'', Michael J. Cohen, pp. 164-165&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
The report of the Woodhead commission was presented to Parliament and published on November 9, 1938. As a consequence, the government issued a policy statement that "the political, administrative and financial difficulties involved in the proposal to create independent Arab and Jewish States inside Palestine are so great that this solution of the problem is impracticable."&lt;ref name="MajestyStatement"&gt;Palestine. Statement by His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom. Presented by the Secretary of State for the Colonies to Parliament by Command of His Majesty. November, 1938.  Cmd. 5893. {{cite web |url=https://unispal.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/0/4941922311B4E3C585256D17004BD2E2 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-11-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131103061306/http://unispal.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/0/4941922311B4E3C585256D17004BD2E2 |archivedate=2013-11-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Jewish Agency]] Executive responded that the Woodhead report could not "serve as the basis for any negotiations, either between the Jews and the Arabs or between the Jewish Agency and the [British] government."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.il/books?id=MAbY8v1UkDEC&amp;pg=PA238&amp;dq=woodhead+commission&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=5SYcT_rACsKb8gOAvKHJCw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=woodhead%20commission&amp;f=false ''The Partition of Palestine: Decision Crossroads in the Zionist Movement,'' Itzhak Galnoor]&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite Britain's announcement that the plan was impracticable, it suggested that Arab-Jewish agreement might still be possible.&lt;ref name="avalon" /&gt; In 1939 London invited the Palestine Arabs, the neighboring Arab states and the Jewish Agency to London to participate in a third attempt to resolve the crisis, the [[London Conference (1939)|St. James Conference]] (also known as the Round Table Conference of 1939).  The recommendations were eventually rejected by both Jews and Arabs.&lt;ref name="avalon" /&gt;
