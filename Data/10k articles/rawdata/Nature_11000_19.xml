'''2016 PQ''' is an approximately 20-meter sized [[asteroid]] and [[near-Earth object]] of the [[Apollo asteroid|Apollo group]], with one of the smallest known [[minimum orbital intersection distance]]s with Earth.

== Discovery ==

The asteroid was discovered by the [[Pan-STARRS]] telescope on 2 August 2016, when it had reached [[Magnitude (astronomy)|magnitude]] 20.5, and it had brightened by magnitude 19.0 three nights later, after which it became too close to the Sun to spot with ground-based telescopes. It reached its closest approach to the Earth on 7 August 2016, at 0.025&amp;nbsp;[[Astronomical unit|AU]], or 9.8 [[Lunar distance (astronomy)|lunar distances]].&lt;ref name="jpldata" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MPC-object" /&gt;

== Orbit ==

{{mp|2016 PQ}} orbits the Sun at a distance of 0.9–2.9&amp;nbsp;[[Astronomical unit|AU]] once every 2 years and 8 months (961 days). Its orbit has an [[orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]] of 0.54 and an [[orbital inclination|inclination]] of 3[[Degree (angle)|°]] with respect to the [[ecliptic]].&lt;ref name="jpldata" /&gt;

The asteroid's orbit is near that of a 3:8 [[Orbital resonance|resonance]] with Earth, meaning that for every 8 orbits the Earth makes, {{mp|2016 PQ}} makes roughly 3, contributing to the fact that it makes no significant close approaches in the next few decades.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

=== MOID ===

{{mp|2016 PQ}} has a very small [[minimum orbit intersection distance]] (MOID) to the Earth – only around {{convert|14693|km|mi|abbr=off}}, corresponding to 0.038 [[Lunar distance (astronomy)|lunar distances]] or 2.3 [[Earth radii]]. It has the 19th lowest MOID of any known asteroid, as well as the 7th lowest MOID of any object larger than it (after {{mpl|(433953) 1997 XR|2}}, {{mp|2006 QV|89}}, [[(85236) 1993 KH]], {{mpl|2013 TX|68}}, 2014 DA, and [[2004 FH]]).

Despite its very low MOID, it is not on the [[Sentry (monitoring system)|Sentry Risk Table]], as it is not going to make any nearby close approaches to Earth in the near future.&lt;ref name="jpldata" /&gt; It is too small to be classified as a [[potentially hazardous asteroid]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3769">'''Aisyt''' ('''Aysyt''', '''Ajsyt''' or '''Ajyhyt'''; '''{{lang-sah|Айыыһыт}}''' ''Ayııhıt'') is a fertility deity of the [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] [[Yakuts|Yakut]] people from the [[Lena River]] region of [[Siberia]]. The name means "birthgiver" and may also be called the "Mother of Cradles".&lt;ref name="Loar2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Julie Loar|title=Goddesses for Every Day: Exploring the Wisdom and Power of the Divine Feminine Around the World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OturV0aQa-IC&amp;pg=RA1-PA8|accessdate=3 January 2012|date=1 December 2010|publisher=New World Library|isbn=978-1-57731-950-4|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her full name is given as '''Ajysyt-ijaksit-khotan''', meaning "Birthgiving nourishing mother".{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} Aisyt brings the soul from heaven at the birth of a baby and records each one in the Golden Book of Fate and daughter of [[Yer Tanrı]].

==Role==
Ajysyt was responsible for conducting the [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] of a newborn child to its birth and attended every birth. Women would [[channeling (as a medium)|channel]] Ajysyt, believing that doing so would relieve them of pain during childbirth.&lt;ref name="Loar2010"/&gt; She kept a golden book in which she recorded each one. She is said to have lived on a mountain top in a house with seven stories,&lt;ref name="Loar2010"/&gt; from which she controlled the fate of the world.

==Versions==
The Yakut revere a variety of ajy ({{lang-sah|Айы}}). The primary manifestation, Nelbey Ajyhyt, is responsible for the birth of children; Dzhyësyëgyëy Toyon and Kieng Kieli-Baly Toyon govern the reproduction of horses; Isegey Ajyhyt has responsibility for oxen; and Noruluya manages dogs and foxes. &lt;ref name="Meletinskii"&gt;{{cite book|editor=E. M. Meletinskii|title=Mefologicheskii slovar'|date=1990|publisher=Sovetskaya entsiklopediya}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When referring to the fertility deity for the births of male animals, such as stallions or bulls, the word ''ajysyt'' is understood to be male. However, when relating to the birth of a mare or cow, the word is feminine.&lt;ref name="Jordan2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael Jordan|title=Dictionary of gods and goddesses|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aqDC5bwx4_wC&amp;pg=PA10|accessdate=3 January 2012|year=2004|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=978-0-8160-5923-2|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legends==
One legend recalls how she appeared from the roots of the [[Cosmic Tree]] (alternatively the [[world pillar]] of Yryn-al-tojon)to a pale young man; the tree stood beside a lake of milk. By [[suckling]] the youth she caused his strength to increase a hundredfold.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

Aisyt was a daughter of Gok-Tengri (Sky-God) and Toprak Ana (Mother Earth) and was viewed with both fear and affection. She represented the night and was pictured as a noble woman. The night's darkness heralded the emergence of malicious spirits from holes.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}}

==Contemporary representation==

Ajysyt is a featured figure on [[Judy Chicago]]'s installation piece ''[[The Dinner Party]]'', being represented as one of the 999 names on the ''[[List of women in the Heritage Floor|Heritage Floor]].''&lt;ref name="AjysytBM"&gt;{{cite web | author= | year=2007 | title=Ajysyt | work=Elizabeth A.

'''Akari''' ('''ASTRO-F''') is an [[infrared astronomy]] [[space observatory|satellite]] developed by [[Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency]], in cooperation with institutes of Europe and Korea.  It was launched on 21 February 2006, at 21:28 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]] (06:28, 22 February [[Japan Standard Time|JST]]) by [[M-V rocket]] into Earth [[sun-synchronous orbit]]. After its launch it was named ''Akari'' (明かり), which means ''light'' in Japanese. Earlier on, the project was known as '''IRIS''' (InfraRed Imaging Surveyor).

Its primary mission was to survey the entire sky in near-, mid- and [[far-infrared]], through its {{convert|68.5|cm|abbr=on}} aperture telescope.&lt;ref name="jaxa"&gt;{{cite news|title=JAXA Hopes To Keep Akari Going Despite Power Failure|url=http://www.spacenews.com/civil/110527-jaxa-keep-akari-going.html|accessdate=17 August 2011|newspaper=Space News International|date=27 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technical design==
Its designed lifespan, of far- and mid-infrared sensors, is 550 days, limited by its liquid [[helium]] coolant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The Infrared Astronomical Satellite AKARI and Nikon | url=http://www.nikon.com/about/technology/field/akari/index3.htm | publisher=Nikon | date=September 2007 | accessdate=26 November 2011 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130302192815/http://www.nikon.com/about/technology/field/akari/index3.htm | archivedate=2 March 2013 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its telescope mirror is made of [[silicon carbide]] to save weight. The budget for the satellite was [[Japanese yen|¥]]13,4 billion (~{{US$|110 million}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Editor | title=Fueling trust in rocket science | url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/ed20060228a1.html |work=The Japan Times  | date=28 February 2006 | accessdate=16 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
By mid-August 2006, Akari finished around 50 percent of the all sky survey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Issei Yamamura |title=AKARI Mission Lifetime |url=http://www.ir.isas.jaxa.jp/ASTRO-F/Observation/Newsletter/afnl_e_016.txt |work=AKARI Newsletter |volume=vol. 16 |date=August 2006 |accessdate=16 May 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110525172828/http://www.ir.isas.jaxa.jp/ASTRO-F/Observation/Newsletter/afnl_e_016.txt |archivedate=25 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the malfunction of sun-sensor after the launch, ejection of telescope [[aperture]] lid was delayed, resulting the coolant lifespan estimate to be shortened to about 500 days from launch. However, after JAXA estimated the remaining helium during early March 2007, observation time will be extended at least until 9 September.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Issei Yamamura |title=AKARI Cryogenic Lifetime |url=http://www.ir.isas.jaxa.jp/ASTRO-F/Observation/Newsletter/afnl_e_018.txt |work=AKARI Newsletter |volume=vol. 18 |date=9 March 2007 |accessdate=16 May 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110525172919/http://www.ir.isas.jaxa.jp/ASTRO-F/Observation/Newsletter/afnl_e_018.txt |archivedate=25 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 July 2007, JAXA informed that 90 percent of the sky was scanned twice. Also around 3,500 selected targets have been observed so far.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.isas.jaxa.jp/e/snews/2007/0711.shtml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-07-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20070731062113/http://www.isas.jaxa.jp/e/snews/2007/0711.shtml |archivedate=31 July 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 August 2007, liquid-Helium coolant depleted, which means the completion of far- and mid-infrared observation. More than 96 percent  of the sky was scanned and more than 5,000 pointed observations were done.&lt;ref name="UsuiKuroda2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Usui|first1=Fumihiko|last2=Kuroda|first2=Daisuke|last3=MÜLler|first3=Thomas G.|last4=Hasegawa|first4=Sunao|last5=Ishiguro|first5=Masateru|last6=Ootsubo|first6=Takafumi|last7=Ishihara|first7=Daisuke|last8=Kataza|first8=Hirokazu|last9=Takita|first9=Satoshi|last10=Oyabu|first10=Shinki|last11=Ueno|first11=Munetaka|last12=Matsuhara|first12=Hideo|last13=Onaka|first13=Takashi|title=Asteroid Catalog Using AKARI: AKARI/IRC Mid-Infrared Asteroid Survey|journal=Publications of the Astronomical Society of Japan|volume=63|issue=5|year=2011|pages=1117–1138|issn=0004-6264|doi=10.1093/pasj/63.5.1117|bibcode=2011PASJ...63.1117U}}&lt;/ref&gt;

British and Japanese project team members were awarded a [[Daiwa Adrian Prize]] in 2004, by [[The Daiwa Anglo-Japanese Foundation]] in recognition of their collaboration.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dajf.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/DAP-2013-fact-sheet.doc&lt;/ref&gt;

During December 2007, JAXA performed orbit correction manoeuvres to bring Akari back into its ideal orbit. This was necessary because the boiled off [[helium]] led to an increase in altitude. If this would have continued energy supply would have been cut off.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Issei Yamamura |title=Happy Birthday, AKARI! |url=http://www.ir.isas.jaxa.jp/ASTRO-F/Observation/Newsletter/afnl_e_021.txt |work=AKARI Newsletter |volume=vol. 21 |date=26 February 2008 |accessdate=16 May 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110525172923/http://www.ir.isas.jaxa.jp/ASTRO-F/Observation/Newsletter/afnl_e_021.txt |archivedate=25 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2011, Akari suffered a major electrical failure that rendered its science instruments inoperable when the satellite is in the Earth's shadow.&lt;ref name="jaxa"/&gt;  The operation of satellite was terminated officially on 24 November 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jaxa.jp/press/2011/11/20111124_akari_j.html |title=赤外線天文衛星「あかり」（ASTRO-F）の運用終了について |language=Japanese |publisher=JAXA |date=24 November 2011 |accessdate=24 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Amperex Electronic Corporation''' was a manufacturer of [[vacuum tube]]s and [[semiconductor]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Knight (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Brooklyn, New York ==
Originally located at 79 Washington Street in [[Brooklyn, New York]], Amperex was a long-established manufacturer of transmitting tubes when they were acquired by the Dutch firm, [[Philips]], (known more widely as Norelco in the US), around 1955. Philips continued to improve and enlarge the  tube plant in New York, but also used the Amperex name to distribute their new line of Dutch-made miniature tubes, ([[12AX7]], [[12AU7]], [[12AT7]]) to feed the booming U.S. [[High fidelity|hi-fi]] market. Classic hi-fi brands such as [[Marantz]], Fisher, and [[H. H. Scott, Inc.]], used these tubes. Amperex also produced the [[6DJ8]], 6922 and 7308 frame grid tubes. Developed by Amperex in 1958 when transistors were beginning to supplant tubes and originally developed for video and radar use, the 6DJ8 also excelled in audio amplifiers needing its high [[transconductance]], and it still has a niche market among [[audiophile]]s.

[[File:Amperex OA2.JPG|thumb|100px|right|A voltage regulator vacuum tube made by Amperex]]Amperex tubes were original equipment parts in many models of [[Tektronix]] and [[Hewlett-Packard]] test equipment. Although Amperex stopped making vacuum tubes long ago, hoards of [[new old stock]] (especially the original "Bugle Boy" series) are traded for profit, and other manufacturers produced compatible tubes more recently.

== Hicksville, New York ==
[[Image:Amperex Hicksville.jpg|thumb|Amperex facility in Hicksville, New York]]
A new factory was constructed at 230 Duffy Avenue, [[Hicksville, New York]], to manufacture electron tubes and semiconductors. Miniature receiving tubes, [[magnetron]]s, X-ray tubes, Geiger-Muller tubes, and large transmitting tubes were also manufactured at this location. This location became the headquarters for North American Philips (NAP). The factory was completed in 1953 and closed in 1989. All assets were then sold to Richardson Electronics of rural Lafox, near [[Batavia, Illinois]].

The Hicksville factory had a company-sponsored softball team that played at [[Eisenhower Park]] (then called Salisbury Park) in [[East Meadow, New York]].

== Slatersville, Rhode Island ==
[[Image:Ri1 Slatersville.jpg|thumb|Amperex facility in Slatersville, Rhode Island]]
[[Image:RI2 Slatersville.jpg|thumb|Amperex facility in Slatersville, Rhode Island]]
North American Philips Corporation built a {{convert|40000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} plant at 100 Providence Pike, [[North Smithfield, Rhode Island]] ([[Slatersville, Rhode Island|Slatersville]]) on a {{convert|15|acre|m2|adj=on}} plot in 1959. The 15-acre property is recorded by the Town of North Smithfield Tax Assessor as Lot No. 60 on Plat No. 4, and Lot No. 385 on Plat No. 5. There are five buildings located on the property. The property is bordered to the north by Industrial Drive; to the south by Comstock Road, to the east by a grassy area; and to the west by Providence Pike. The plant was operated by one of Philips' fully owned subsidiaries, Amperex Electronics, to supply [[IBM]], one of Philips' largest customers, with high speed, gold-doped [[germanium]] logic diodes. Millions of these diodes were manufactured at the Slatersville plant every year. With the advent of silicon diodes in 1962 there was a decreasing demand for these germanium diodes, so Philips transferred their germanium [[Alloy-junction transistor#Post-alloy diffused transistor|Post Alloy Diffused Transistor]] (PADT) manufacturing to Slatersville to take advantage of the site's capacity.

In 1960 Philips invented an imaging tube called the [[Video camera tube#Plumbicon|Plumbicon]] to replace the [[Video camera tube#Vidicon|vidicon]] and [[Video camera tube#Image orthicon|Image Orthicon]] tubes used in studio television cameras. The technical advantages of this new tube allowed true color fidelity to be seen in television broadcasts for the first time. In 1967 the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences presented Philips with an [[Emmy Award]] for "Outstanding Achievement in Engineering Development" for the invention of the Plumbicon tube.

The popularity of the Plumbicon tubes was so great that Amperex, built a second plant adjacent to the 1959 building on the Slatersville site to meet the demand. The new plant was {{convert|85000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}}, and at the time of construction employed the largest and cleanest clean room facilities in the world. The plant was officially opened in 1967 and is still making Plumbicon camera tubes today. Although the original use of Plumbicon camera tubes was in broadcast television, current demand is primarily in for use in medical imaging equipment.

In 1973, several years after its acquisition by Amperex, the manufacturing operations of Advanced Micro Electronics were transferred to Slatersville. The products transferred from Advanced Micro Electronics included small signal silicon planar transistors for military and industrial applications, Leadless Inverted Devices (LIDs) and [[hybrid circuit]]s using both thin and thick film technology. Manufacturing of these three products and the sales office for Philips Semiconductors were housed in Slatersville until 1992 when this business unit was sold.

In 1998 Philips Components purchased, from English Electric Valve (EEV), the only other lead oxide camera tube business still in existence and so became the World's sole lead oxide camera tube manufacturer.

== Cranston, Rhode Island ==
[[Image:Cranston.jpg|thumb|Amperex facility in Cranston, Rhode Island]]
Amperex had a {{convert|25000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} manufacturing facility at 99 Bald Hill Road, [[Cranston, Rhode Island]], that manufactured monolithic integrated circuits . 
It was acquired by Micro Components Corporation, later renamed Cherry Semiconductor,  moved to 1900 South County Trl, East Greenwich, RI.  then sold to [[ON Semiconductor]], a subsidiary of Motorola until 1999.

== Other divisions ==
Ferroxcube, in [[Saugerties (town), New York|Saugerties, New York]], manufactured components for data processing equipment, namely, electromagnetic cores, memory planes, stacks of memory planes with controlled networks, shielding beads, threaded slugs, choke coils, filters, resistors, magnetic recording head assemblies, memory systems, [[Thermoelectric battery|Peltier batteries]] with or without control networks, capacitors, and [[Magnetostriction|magnetostrictive]] ferrites.  Ferroxcube now belongs to [[Yageo|Yageo Corporation]].

Amperex also operated a site in North Smithfield, RI . In the 1980s it was used for marketing, sales, QC and Engineering R&amp;D of their discrete semi-conductor business. Before any components were shipped to US based customers QC staff would run some or all pieces through EATON testing equipment. Engineers at customer sites would work with Amperex engineers to determine the best use and components for the customer needs.

== Other products ==
[[Image:GP-300 Matrix Printer.jpg|thumb|GP-300_Matrix Printer]]
For a brief time Amperex distributed a dot matrix printer, model GP-300.

An '''atmospheric river''' ('''AR''') is a narrow corridor or filament of concentrated moisture in the [[atmosphere]]. Atmospheric rivers consist of narrow bands of enhanced [[water vapor]] transport, typically along the boundaries between large areas of divergent surface air flow, including some [[Weather front|frontal zone]]s in association with [[extratropical cyclone]]s that form over the oceans.&lt;ref name="ar94"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zhu |first=Yong |author2=Reginald E.

==Description==
[[File:DesmondAtmosphericRiver.png|thumb|left|Layered precipitable water imagery of particularly strong atmospheric rivers on 5 December 2015.]]

The term was originally coined by researchers Reginald Newell and Yong Zhu of the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] in the early 1990s, to reflect the narrowness of the moisture plumes involved.&lt;ref name="ar94" /&gt;&lt;ref name="sci06" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Newell|first=Reginald E.|author2=Nicholas E.

In the current research field of atmospheric rivers the length and width factors described above in conjunction with an integrated water vapor depth greater than 2.0&amp;nbsp;cm are used as standards to categorize atmospheric river events.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="grl06" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Guan|first=Bin|last2=Waliser|first2=Duane E.|last3=Molotch|first3=Noah P.|last4=Fetzer|first4=Eric J.|last5=Neiman|first5=Paul J.|date=2011-08-24|title=Does the Madden–Julian Oscillation Influence Wintertime Atmospheric Rivers and Snowpack in the Sierra Nevada?|url=http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/MWR-D-11-00087.1|journal=Monthly Weather Review|volume=140|issue=2|pages=325–342|doi=10.1175/MWR-D-11-00087.1|issn=0027-0644|bibcode=2012MWRv..140..325G}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Guan|first=Bin|last2=Waliser|first2=Duane E.|date=2015-12-27|title=Detection of atmospheric rivers: Evaluation and application of an algorithm for global studies|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2015JD024257/abstract|journal=Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres  |volume=120 |issue=24 |pages=2015JD024257 |doi=10.1002/2015JD024257|issn=2169-8996|bibcode=2015JGRD..12012514G}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As data modeling techniques progress, integrated water vapor transport (IVT) is becoming a more common data type used to interpret atmospheric rivers. Its strength lies in its ability to show the transportation of water vapor over multiple time steps instead of a stagnant measurement of water vapor depth in a specific air column (IWV). In addition IVT is more directly attributed to [[Orographic rain|orographic precipitation]], a key factor in the production of intense rainfall and subsequent flooding.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; For instance the water vapor image to the left shows two rivers on 5 December 2015: the first, stretching from the [[Caribbean]] to the [[United Kingdom]], caused by [[Storm Desmond]], and the second originating from the [[Philippines]] is crossing [[Pacific Ocean]] to the west coast of North America.

Atmospheric rivers have a central role in the global [[water cycle]]. On any given day, atmospheric rivers account for over 90% of the global meridional (north-south) water vapor transport, yet they cover less than 10% of the Earth's circumference.&lt;ref name="mwr98" /&gt; Atmospheric rivers are also known to contribute to about 22% of total global runoff.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Paltan|first=Homero|last2=Waliser|first2=Duane|last3=Lim|first3=Wee Ho|last4=Guan|first4=Bin|last5=Yamazaki|first5=Dai|last6=Pant|first6=Raghav|last7=Dadson|first7=Simon|date=2017-10-25|title=Global Floods and Water Availability Driven by Atmospheric Rivers|url=https://doi.org/10.1002/2017GL074882|journal=Geophysical Research Letters|language=en|volume=44|issue=20|pages=10,387–10,395|doi=10.1002/2017gl074882|issn=0094-8276|bibcode=2017GeoRL..4410387P}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6919">An '''atmospheric sounding''' is a measurement of vertical distribution of physical properties of the [[atmosphere|atmospheric]] column such as [[atmospheric pressure|pressure]], [[temperature]], [[wind speed]] and [[wind direction]] (thus deriving [[wind shear]]), liquid water content, [[ozone]] concentration, pollution, and other properties. Such measurements are performed in a variety of ways including [[remote sensing]] and [[in situ#Earth and atmospheric sciences|in situ]] observations.

The most common in situ sounding is a [[radiosonde]], which usually is a [[weather balloon]], but can also be a [[rocketsonde]].

Remote sensing soundings generally use passive [[infrared]] and [[microwave]] [[radiometer]]s:
* airborne instruments
* surface stations
* Earth-observing satellite instruments such as [[Atmospheric Infrared Sounder|AIRS]] and [[Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit|AMSU]]
* observation of atmospheres on different planets, such as the [[Mars climate sounder]] on the [[Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter]]

==Direct methods==

Sensors that measure atmospheric constituents directly, such as thermometers, barometers, and humidity sensors, can be sent aloft on balloons, rockets or [[dropsonde]]s. They can also be carried on the outer hulls of ships and aircraft or even mounted on towers. In this case, all that is needed to capture the measurements are storage devices and/or [[transponder]]s.

==Indirect methods==

The more challenging case involves sensors, primarily satellite-mounted, such as [[radiometers]], optical sensors, [[radar]], [[lidar]] and [[ceilometer]] as well as [[sodar]] since these cannot measure the quantity of interest, such as temperature, pressure, humidity etc., directly. By understanding emission and absorption processes, we can figure out what the instrument is looking at between the layers of atmosphere.
While this type of instrument can also be operated from ground stations or vehicles—optical methods can also be used inside in situ instruments—satellite instruments are particularly important because of their extensive, regular coverage. The [[Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit|AMSU]] instruments on three [[NOAA]] and two [[EUMETSAT]] satellites, for instance, can sample the entire globe at better than one degree resolution in less than a day.

We can distinguish between two broad classes of sensor: ''active'', such as [[radar]], that have their own source, and ''passive'' that only detect what is already there. There can be a variety of sources for a passive instrument, including scattered radiation, light emitted directly from the sun, moon or stars—both more appropriate in the visual or ultra-violet range—as well light emitted from warm objects, which is more appropriate in the microwave and infrared.

===Viewing geometry===
A limb sounder looks at the edge of the atmosphere where it is visible above the Earth.  It does this in one of two ways: either it tracks the sun, moon, a star, or another transmitting satellite through the limb as the source gets [[occultation|occultated]] behind the Earth, or it looks towards empty space, collecting radiation that is scattered from one of these sources. In contrast, a [[nadir]]-looking atmospheric sounder looks down through the atmosphere at the surface. The [[SCIAMACHY]] instrument operates in all three of these modes.

==Atmospheric inverse problem==

===Statement of the problem===

The following applies mainly to passive sensors, but has some applicability to active sensors.

Typically, there is a vector of values of the quantity to be retrieved, &lt;math&gt;\vec x&lt;/math&gt;, called the '''state vector''' and a vector of measurements, &lt;math&gt;\vec y&lt;/math&gt;. The state vector could be temperatures, ozone number densities, humidities etc. The measurement vector is typically counts, radiances or brightness temperatures from a radiometer or similar detector but could include any other quantity germain to the problem.
The '''forward model''' maps the state vector to the measurement vector:

:&lt;math&gt;
\vec y = \vec f (\vec x)
&lt;/math&gt;

Usually the mapping, &lt;math&gt;\vec f&lt;/math&gt;, is known from physical first principles, but this may not always be the case. Instead, it may only be known [[empirical]]ly, by matching actual measurements with actual states. Satellite and many other [[remote sensing]] instruments do not measure the relevant physical properties, that is the state, but rather the amount of radiation  emitted in a particular direction, at a particular frequency. It is usually easy to go from the state space to the measurement space—for instance with [[Beer's law]] or [[radiative transfer]]—but not the other way around, therefore we need some method of [[inverse problem|inverting]] &lt;math&gt;\vec f&lt;/math&gt; or of finding the '''inverse model''', &lt;math&gt;\vec f^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;.

===Methods of solution===

If the problem is [[linear]] we can use some type of matrix inverse method—often the problem is [[ill-posed]] or [[Numerical instability|unstable]] so we will need to [[regularization (mathematics)|regularize]] it: good, simple methods include the [[normal equation]] or [[singular value decomposition]]. If the problem is weakly nonlinear, an iterative method such [[Newton-Raphson]] may be appropriate.

Sometimes the physics is too complicated to model accurately or the forward model too slow to be used effectively in the inverse method. In this case, [[statistical]] or [[machine learning]] methods such as [[linear regression]], [[neural networks]], [[statistical classification]], [[kernel estimation]], etc. can be used to form an inverse model based on a collection of ordered pairs of samples mapping the state space to the measurement space, that is, &lt;math&gt;\lbrace \vec x: \vec y \rbrace&lt;/math&gt;. These can be generated either from models—e.g. state vectors from dynamical models and measurement vectors from radiative transfer or similar forward models—or from direct, empirical measurement. Other times when a statistical method might be more appropriate include highly [[nonlinear]] problems.

'''Bear worship''' (also known as the '''bear cult''' or '''arctolatry''') is the religious practice of the [[worship]]ing of [[bear]]s found in many North [[Eurasia]]n ethnic religions such as the [[Sami people|Sami]], [[Nivkh people|Nivkh]], [[Ainu people|Ainu]],{{sfn|Bledsoe|p=1}}, [[Christianization|pre-Christian]] [[Basques]], and [[Finnish Paganism|Finns]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilfred Bonser (2012) "The Mythology of the Kalevala, with Notes on Bear-Worship Among the Finns.", p. 344&lt;/ref&gt; There are also a number of [[artio|deities]] from [[Celtic Gaul]] and [[British Isles|Britain]] associated with the bear, and the [[Dacians]], [[Thracians]], and [[Getae|Getians]] were noted to worship bears and annually celebrate the bear dance festival. The bear is featured on many [[totem]]s throughout northern cultures that carve them.{{sfn|Wunn|2000|pp=434-435}}

==Palaeolithic cult==

The existence of an ancient bear cult among [[Neandertal]]s in [[Western Eurasia]] in the [[Middle Paleolithic]] has been a topic of discussion spurred by archaeological findings.{{sfn|Wunn|2000|pp=434-435}} The Neanderthals would have worshiped the [[cave bear]] (''Ursus spelaeus'') and ancient bear bones have been discovered in several different caves and are believed by some archaeologists to be evidence of a bear cult during the [[Paleolithic]]. It was not the mere presence of these bones that intrigued archaeologists, but their peculiar arrangement.{{sfn|Wunn|2000|p=435}} Upon excavation, archaeologists on site determined that the bones were found arranged in such a way that it was not naturally possible.{{sfn|Wunn|2000|p=435}} Emil Bächler, a main supporter of the argument for the presence of an ancient bear cult, found bear remains in Switzerland and at Mornova Cave in [[Slovenia]]. Along with Bächler’s discovery, bear skulls were found by André Leroi-Gourhan arranged in a perfect circle in [[Saône-et-Loire]].{{sfn|Wunn|2000|p=435}} The discovery of designs such as those found by [[André Leroi-Gourhan]] suggests that these bear remains were placed in their arrangement intentionally; an act which has been attributed to Neandertals and is assumed to have been a part of some sort of ceremony.{{sfn|Wunn|2000|p=435}}

While some of these findings have been interpreted to indicate the presence of an ancient bear cult, certain analyses and discussions have led to contradicting results. According to Ina Wunn, based on the information archaeologists have about primitive man and bear cults, if Neandertals did, in fact, worship bears, there should be evidence of it in their settlements and camps.{{sfn|Wunn|2000|p=436}} Most bear remains have been found in caves, however, and not within early human settlements.{{sfn|Wunn|2000|p=436}} This information has implied the non-existence of an ancient bear cult and has instigated the development of new theories. Many archaeologists, including Ina Wunn, have come to believe that since most bear species reside and hide their young in caves during the winter months for hibernation, it is possible that their remains were found in the caves because caves were their natural habitat.{{sfn|Wunn|2000|pp=436-437}} Bears lived inside these caves and perished for various reasons, whether it was illness or starvation.{{sfn|Wunn|2000|p=437}} Wunn argues that the placement of these remains, whether it appears to be an identified pattern or not, is due to natural causes such as wind, sediment, or water.{{sfn|Wunn|2000|pp=437-438}} Therefore, in Wunn’s opinion, the assortment of bear remains in caves did not result from human activities and there is no evidence for a bear cult during the Middle Paleolithic era.{{sfn|Wunn|2000|pp=438}} Certain archaeologists, such as Emil Bächler, continue to use their excavations to support that an ancient bear cult did exist.{{sfn|Wunn|2000}}

===Eastern Slavic culture===
Bear were the most worshipped animals of Ancient Slavs. During pagan times, it was associated with the god [[Veles (god)|Volos]], the patron of domestic animals. Slavic folklore describes the bear as a totem personifying a male: father, husband, or a fiance. Legends about turnskin bears appeared, it was believed that humans could be turned into bears for misbehavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Most Russian of All Beasts |url=https://scfh.ru/en/papers/the-most-russian-of-all-beasts/ |accessdate=21 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nivkh bear festival===
[[File:V.M. Doroshevich-Sakhalin. Part II. Nivkh Amusement.png|thumb|250px|A bear festival by Nivkh around 1903]]
The bear festival is a religious festival celebrated by the indigenous [[Nivkh people|Nivkh]] in Russia's far east. A Nivkh Shaman (ch'am) would preside over the Bear Festival, celebrated in the winter between January and February depending on the clan. Bears were captured and raised in a corral for several years by local women, treating the bear like a child. The bear is considered a sacred earthly manifestation of Nivkh ancestors and the gods in bear form. During the Festival the bear is dressed in a specially made ceremonial costume and offered a banquet to take back to the realm of gods to show benevolence upon the clans.{{sfn|Chaussonnet|1995|pp=35,81}} After the banquet the bear is killed and eaten in an elaborate religious ceremony. The festival was arranged by relatives to honor the death of a kinsman. The bear's spirit returns to the gods of the mountain 'happy' and rewards the Nivkh with bountiful forests.{{sfn|Sternberg|Grant|1999|p=160}} Generally, the Bear Festival was an inter-clan ceremony where a clan of wife-takers restored ties with a clan of wife-givers upon the broken link of the kinsman's death.{{sfn|Chaussonnet|1995|p=35}} The Bear Festival was suppressed in the Soviet period; since then the festival has had a modest revival, albeit as a cultural rather than a religious ceremony.{{sfn|Gall|1998|pp=4-6}}

==Ainu bear worship==
{{Main article|Iomante}}

[[File:Iomante1.JPG|250px|thumb|right|The [[Ainu people|Ainu]] ''[[Iomante]]'' ceremony around 1930]]
The [[Ainu people]], who live on select islands in the Japanese archipelago, call the bear “[[Kamuy|kamuy]]” in their language, which translates to mean "god". While many other animals are considered to be gods in the Ainu culture, the bear is the head of the gods.{{sfn|Kindaichi|Yoshida|1949|p=345}} For the Ainu, when the gods visit the world of man, they don fur and claws and take on the physical appearance of an animal. Usually, however, when the term “kamuy” is used, it essentially means a bear.{{sfn|Kindaichi|Yoshida|1949|p=345}} The Ainu people willingly and thankfully ate the bear as they believed that the disguise (the flesh and fur) of any god was a gift to the home that the god chose to visit.{{sfn|Kindaichi|Yoshida|1949|p=348}}&lt;ref&gt;O. Harrassowitz (2007) "Journal of Asian History, Volume 41", p. 134-135&lt;/ref&gt;

While on earth &amp;ndash; the world of man &amp;ndash; the Ainu believed that the gods appeared in the form of animals. The gods had the capability of taking human form, but they only took this form in their home, the country of the gods, which is outside the world of man.{{sfn|Kindaichi|Yoshida|1949|p=345}} To return a god back to his country, the people would sacrifice and eat the animal sending the god’s spirit away with civility. This ritual is called Omante and usually involves a deer or adult bear.{{sfn|Kindaichi|Yoshida|1949|p=348}}

Omante occurred when the people sacrificed an adult bear, but when they caught a bear cub they performed a different ritual which is called Iomante, in the Ainu language, or Kumamatsuri in Japanese. Kumamatsuri translates to “ bear festival” and Iomante means “sending off”.{{sfn|Kindaichi|Yoshida|1949|pp=348-349}} The event of Kumamatsuri began with the capture of a young bear cub. As if he was a child given by the gods, the cub was fed human food from a carved wooden platter and was treated better than Ainu children for they thought of him as a god.{{sfn|Kindaichi|Yoshida|1949|p=349}} If the cub was too young and lacked the teeth to properly chew food, a nursing mother will let him suckle from her own breast.{{sfn|Kindaichi|Yoshida|1949|p=349}} When the cub reaches 2–3 years of age, the cub is taken to the altar and then sacrificed. Usually, Kumamatsuri occurs in midwinter when the bear meat is the best from the added fat.{{sfn|Kindaichi|Yoshida|1949|p=349}} The villagers will shoot it with both normal and ceremonial arrows, make offerings, dance, and pour wine on top of the cub corpse.{{sfn|Kindaichi|Yoshida|1949|p=349}} The words of sending off for the bear god are then recited. This festivity lasts for three days and three nights to properly return the bear god to his home.{{sfn|Kindaichi|Yoshida|1949|p=349}}

==Bears in Korean mythology==

According to legend, [[Ungnyeo]] (literally "bear woman") was a bear who turned into a woman, and gave birth to [[Dangun]], the founder of the first Korean kingdom, [[Gojoseon]]. Along with the tiger, the bear plays an important role in [[Korean shamanism]].{{cn|date=July 2017}}

==Bear Worship Among Other Peoples==

==Altaic Peoples==
Between 1925-1927, [https://www.academia.edu/8095199/Dyrenkova-Bear_worship_among_the_Turkish_Tribes_of_Siberia Dyrenkova] made field observations of bear worship among the Altai, Tubalar (Tuba-Kiji), Telengit, and Shortsi of the Kuznetskaja Taiga as well as among the Sagai tribes in the regions of Minussinsk, near the Kuznetskaja Taiga (1927).

==Finns==

==Pyrenees==
There are annual bear festivals that take place in various towns and communes in the Pyrenees region. 

In [[Prats-de-Mollo-la-Preste|Prats-de-Mollo]], the {{illm|Fête de l’ours de Prats-de-Mollo-la-Preste{{!}}''Fête de l'Ours''|fr|Fête de l’ours de Prats-de-Mollo-la-Preste}} ("festival of the bear") held on [[Candlemas]] (February 2) is a ritual in which men dressed up as bears brandishing sticks terrorize people in the streets.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Webb |first=Mick |title=Bear Mountain: The battle to save the Pyrenean brown bear |publisher=Guardian Books |year=n.d. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Kp-bBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT6 |pages=&lt;!--unpaginated--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Formerly, the festival centered on the "bears" mock-attacking the women and trying to blacken their breasts (with soot), which seemed scandalous to outside first-time observers. But according to the testimony of someone who remembered the olden days before that, the festival that at Prats-de-Mollo involved elaborate staging, much like the version in [[Arles-sur-Tech|Arles]].&lt;ref name=fabre&gt;{{citation|last=Fabre |first=Daniel |title=Recherches sur Jean de l'Ours (2e partie)|journal=Folklore: revue d'ethnographie méridonale| volume=XXII |number=134 |year=1969 |url=http://garae.fr/Folklore/R52_134_ETE_1969.pdf |pages=10–11&lt;!--2-41--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Arles-sur-Tech]] version ({{illm|Fête de l’ours d’Arles-sur-Tech{{!}}''Fête de l’ours d’Arles-sur-Tech''|fr|Fête de l’ours d’Arles-sur-Tech}}) involves a female character named Rosetta (Roseta) who gets abducted by the "bear". Rosetta was traditionally played by a man or a boy dressed up as a girl.&lt;!--Mr. Mackintosh was writing in 1923~1927; they seem to use pantomime props now.--&gt; The "bear" would bring the Rosetta to a hut raised on the center square of town (where the victim would be fed sausages, cake, and white wine). The event finished with the "bear" being shaved and "killed".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|editor-last=Crichton |editor-first=Robin |title=Monsieur Mackintosh: the travels and paintings of Charles Rennie Mackintosh in the Pyrénées Orientales, 1923-1927 |publisher=Luath |year=2007 |url=https://books.google.co.jp/books?hl=ja&amp;id=7YNIAQAAIAAJ |page=41&lt;!--unpaginated--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=fabre/&gt;

A well-known bear festival also occurs at Haute-Vallespir ({{illm|Fêtes de l'ours en Vallespir{{!}}''Fêtes de l'ours en Vallespir''|fr|Fêtes de l'ours en Vallespir}}).&lt;ref name=fabre/&gt;

'''Birds Hill Provincial Park''' is a [[provincial park]] in [[Manitoba]], [[Canada]] located in the [[Boreal Plains Ecozone (CEC)|Boreal Plains ecozone]].&lt;ref name="CESIMap"&gt;{{cite web |title=Canadian Environmental Sustainability Indicators - Canada.ca |url=http://indicators-map.canada.ca/App/Detail?id=08460004017&amp;GoCTemplateCulture=en-CA |website=indicators-map.canada.ca |publisher=Government of Canada |accessdate=26 October 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The park protects areas representative  of Aspen/Oak parkland, as well as provides opportunities for recreation.&lt;ref name="MBMgmtPlan"&gt;{{cite web |title=Birds Hill Provincial Park Management Plan |url=https://www.gov.mb.ca/sd/parks/pdf/planning/2013/bird_hill_management_plan.pdf |publisher=Parks and Natural Areas Branch, Government of Manitoba |accessdate=24 October 2018 |date=Feb 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is located 24 kilometres north of [[Winnipeg]] on [[Manitoba Highway 59|Highway 59]], and covers approximately 8300 acres (35.1 square kilometres).&lt;ref name="GOM-SystemPlan"/&gt;  
[[Image:BirdsHillParkpano.jpg|thumb|right|Birds Hill Park overlooking lake]]
Birds Hill Provincial Park was designated a provincial park by the Government of Manitoba in 1964.&lt;ref name="GOM-SystemPlan"&gt;{{cite book|title=A System Plan for Manitoba's Provincial Parks|date=1998|publisher=Government of Manitoba|page=27|url=https://www.gov.mb.ca/sd/parks/pdf/planning/manitoba_parks_system_plan.pdf|accessdate=1 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The park is considered to be a [[IUCN protected area categories#Category III — Provincial Park|Class III protected area]] under the IUCN protected area management categories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Birds Hill Provincial Park|url=https://www.protectedplanet.net/birds-hill-provincial-park-provincial-park|website=Protected Planet|publisher=United Nations Environment World Conservation Monitoring Centre|accessdate=30 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
[[Image:BirdsHillParkpicnic.jpg|thumb|right|Picnic area beside lake at Birds Hill Provincial Park .]]
Birds Hill Provincial Park is a popular destination, receiving more than a million visitors annually.&lt;ref name="MBMgmtPlan"/&gt; In summer, festivals and sporting events are held, the main campground is heavily booked, and families enjoy the beach and picnic areas. In winter, trails are groomed for cross-country skiing, skijoring and kick-sledding and the riding stable offers horse-drawn sleigh rides.&lt;ref name="MBMgmtPlan"/&gt;

More than half of the park is set aside as backcountry, offering visitors trails for hiking, cross-country skiing, horseback riding and mountain biking. Almost 40% of the park is classified for recreational development use, including the campgrounds, the beach and picnic sites, the scenic roadways, the riding stable and other equestrian facilities, the festival site and the pioneer homesteads.&lt;ref name="MBMgmtPlan"/&gt;

Three scenic roadways were added when the park was developed, North Drive, South Drive and Festival Drive. The paved shoulders of these roads are frequently used for walking, running, roller sports, and cycling.&lt;ref name="MBMgmtPlan"/&gt; 

The park is surrounded on three sides by the [[Rural Municipality of Springfield]], and on the north by the [[Rural Municipality of St. Clements]].&lt;ref name="MBMgmtPlan"/&gt;
 
==Geology==
The park rises in a series of six low rounded hills. Those in the south and west stand 20 meters above the surrounding land while those in the north and east are more than 40 meters higher.&lt;ref name="MBGeologyMap"/&gt;  A lookout tower has been built on Griffiths Hill at about the halfway point of the Chickadee hiking trail.&lt;ref name="Chickadee"&gt;{{cite web |title=Chickadee Trail and Viewing Tower |url=https://www.gov.mb.ca/sd/parks/popular_parks/central/birds_chickadee.html |website=Find Your Favorite Park |publisher=Manitoba Parks and Protected Spaces |accessdate=23 October 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The park's landscape today is still defined by the events of 11,000 to 12,000 years ago as a [[Pleistocene]] glacier retreated and melted into glacial [[Lake Agassiz]].&lt;ref name="MBGeologyMap"&gt;{{cite web |title=Map AR84-5: Quaternary Geology Map of the Birds Hill Area |url=https://gov.mb.ca/iem/info/libmin/AR84-5.pdf |publisher=Province of Manitoba |accessdate=23 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ferguson"/&gt; Initially the glacier melt water deposited sand and gravel in a complex of [[esker|eskers]].&lt;ref name="MBGeologyMap"/&gt; &lt;ref name="Ferguson"/&gt; As the glacier continued to retreat, Lake Agassiz submerged the eskers adding silt and clay around them.&lt;ref name="Ferguson"/&gt; At the edge of the huge lake, spits and beaches formed and eroded as the lake slowly dropped.&lt;ref name="MBGeologyMap"/&gt;  Five major [[high water mark|strandlines]] of this glacial lake can be found within the park boundaries.&lt;ref name="Ferguson"/&gt;

The rock layers beneath Birds Hill Park are consistent with those in the surrounding region. Deepest of all are those of the [[Precambrian]] [[Superior Craton]], the [[intrusive rock|volcano-plutonic]] rocks of the Bird River subprovince.&lt;ref name="Ferguson"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Ferguson |first1=Ian |title=Geology of Birds Hill |url=https://home.cc.umanitoba.ca/~frederik/Teaching/Field_School/Birds%20Hill/Background%20Information/Birds%20Hill%20background.pdf |website=University of Manitoba: Geophysics Field School 2015 Birds Hill Project |publisher=University of Manitoba |accessdate=23 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The older rocks are overlaid by [[Paleozoic]] layers--the dolomitic limestone and dolostone of the [[Red River Formation]] on top of the shale and sandstone of the [[Winnipeg Formation]].&lt;ref name="Ferguson"/&gt; These two [[sedimentary]] layers contain [[aquifer|aquifers]] important to neighbouring communities, including Winnipeg.&lt;ref name="Ferguson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Stantec"/&gt; The glacial and post glacial deposits lying directly on the sedimentary layers within the park allow [[precipitation]] to recharge the aquifer beneath.&lt;ref name="Stantec"&gt;{{cite web |author1=Stantec Consulting Ltd. |title=Partnership of the Manitoba Capital Region Assessment of Water Infrastructure |url=https://winnipegmetroregion.ca/assets/docs/regional_strategies_and_plans/PMCR_RGS_Context_Report_WaterInfras.pdf |publisher=Winnipeg Metropolitan Region |accessdate=23 October 2018 |date=8 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

==Ecology==
[[File:Cedarbogtrail.JPG|thumb|right|Cedar bog self-guiding trail winds through an aspen forest in the park to descend into a bog of eastern white cedar. Cedar Bogs are uncommon in Manitoba.]]
[[Populus tremuloides|Trembling aspen]] and [[Quercus macrocarpa|bur oak]] forest is the dominant plant community found in the park. Prairie species are found in drier upland sites. Wetlands in the park include marshes, [[Picea mariana|black spruce]]/[[Larix laricina|tamarack]] bogs and a [[Thuja occidentalis|cedar]] bog. Other trees found within the park include [[Acer negundo|Manitoba maple]], [[jack pine]], [[Betula papyrifera|paper birch]], [[Picea glauca|white spruce]], and [[Populus balsamifera|balsam poplar]] .&lt;ref name="MBParkInfo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CedarBog"&gt;{{cite web |title=Cedar Bog Self Guiding Trail |url=https://www.gov.mb.ca/sd/parks/popular_parks/central/birds_cedarssf.html |website=www.gov.mb.ca |publisher=Manitoba Parks and Protected Spaces |accessdate=22 October 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Birds Hill Park is home to over 40 mammal species including [[White-tailed deer]].&lt;ref name="MBParkBackground"&gt;{{cite web |title=Birds Hill Provincial Park - Background Information |url=https://www.gov.mb.ca/sd/parks/pdf/public/birds_hill_news_letter_web.pdf |publisher=Manitoba Parks and Protected Spaces |accessdate=16 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over two hundred species of birds have been found within the park boundaries. These include [[Northern goshawk]], [[Northern shrike]], [[Boreal chickadee]], [[Red-breasted nuthatch]], [[American woodcock]], [[Northern saw-whet owl]], [[Sprague's pipit]], [[Indigo bunting]], [[Eastern towhee]], and [[Lark sparrow]].&lt;ref name="MNS"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cleveland |first1=Norman J. |last2=Edie |first2=Scott |last3=Grieef |first3=Gordon D. |last4=Holland |first4=George |last5=Koes |first5=Rudolf F. |last6=Maynard |first6=Julia W. |last7=Neily |first7=Wayne P. |last8=Taylor |first8=Peter |last9=Tkachuk |first9=Russell |title=Birder's Guide to Southeastern Manitoba |date=1988 |publisher=Manitoba Naturalists Society |location=Winnipeg |pages=9 |edition=Second revised and enlarged}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Symphyotrichum sericeum|Western Silvery Aster]], a species protected under federal and provincial Endangered Species laws has been found growing in the park.&lt;ref name="MBParkBackground"/&gt;

==History==
Since the area is higher than the surrounding terrain, what is now Birds Hill Park served early settlers as a refuge from flooding in the years 1826 and 1852.&lt;ref name="MBParkInfo"/&gt;

Between 1895 and 1899, the settlers of Pine Ridge built a [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] church on land then owned by John Uhrich, now within the park. The church closed in 1920 and its building was removed to another site, and later demolished.&lt;ref name=cemetery&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kraushar |first1=Aileen |last2=Beattie |first2=Marion |last3=Edie |first3=Florence |last4=Holland |first4=Edna |last5=Roberts |first5=Frances |last6=Van Slyck |first6=Wyn |title=Springfield : 1st rural municipality in Manitoba, 1873-1973 |date=1974 |publisher=Dugald's Women's Institute |location=Dugald, Manitoba |isbn=0-919212-40-9 |page=320}}&lt;/ref&gt; The church [[cemetery|graveyard]], Pine Ridge Cemetery, is located near Nimowin Road. Many early settlers of the area are buried there.&lt;ref name="MHSCemetery"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Goldsborough |first1=Gordon |title=Historic Sites of Manitoba: Pine Ridge Cemetery (Birds Hill Provincial Park, RM of Springfield) |url=http://www.mhs.mb.ca/docs/sites/pineridgecemetery.shtml |website=Manitoba History |publisher=Manitoba Historical Society |accessdate=21 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The park was formed from land expropriated from more than 150 local landowners in 1964.&lt;ref name="MHS"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Goldsborough |first1=Gordon |title=Historic Sites of Manitoba: Birds Hill Provincial Park Plaque (Birds Hill Provincial Park, RM of Springfield) |url=http://www.mhs.mb.ca/docs/sites/birdshill.shtml |website=Manitoba History |publisher=Manitoba Historical Society |accessdate=21 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The official opening date was marked by a ribbon cutting ceremony by Manitoba premier [[Duff Roblin]] on July 15, 1967.&lt;ref name=park&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kraushar |first1=Aileen |last2=Beattie |first2=Marion |last3=Edie |first3=Florence |last4=Holland |first4=Edna |last5=Roberts |first5=Frances |last6=Van Slyck |first6=Wyn |title=Springfield : 1st rural municipality in Manitoba, 1873-1973 |date=1974 |publisher=Dugald's Women's Institute |location=Dugald, Manitoba |isbn=0-919212-40-9 |page=324}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MHS"/&gt;

The park is named in honor of Dr. [[Curtis Bird]], first speaker of the Manitoba provincial legislature in 1873, whose father had been a factor in the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] and received a large land grant  at this location.&lt;ref name="MBParkInfo"&gt;{{cite web |title=Birds Hill Provincial Park, Park Information and Map |url=https://www.gov.mb.ca/sd/parks/popular_parks/central/birds_info.html |website=Find Your Favorite Park |publisher=Manitoba Parks and Protected Spaces |accessdate=16 October 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

==Events==
Equestrian and cycling events for the [[1967 Pan American Games]] hosted by Winnipeg were held in the park.&lt;ref name="MBNews"&gt;{{cite web |title=Birds Hill Provincial Park Celebrates Its 50th Anniversary |url=https://news.gov.mb.ca/news/index.html?item=41833 |website=News Releases |publisher=Province of Manitoba |accessdate=22 October 2018 |language=en-CA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Winnipeg Folk Festival 2006 (0092).jpg|thumb|right|Winnipeg Folk Festival, Main Stage, 2006.]]
Every July since 1974, the park has been the site of the [[Winnipeg Folk Festival]].&lt;ref name="MBNews"/&gt;  

September 16 1984, [[Pope John Paul II]] celebrated mass at the park during his visit to Manitoba.&lt;ref name="MBParkInfo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MBNews"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=John Paul II - 1984 Visit to Canada |url=http://www.cccb.ca/site/Files/Pope_speeches_1984.html |website=www.cccb.ca |publisher=Canadian Conference of Catholic Bishops |accessdate=22 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 29, 1992, [[Bryan Adams]] performed at the ''Waking Up the Nation Festival''  held at the park with the [[Music of Manitoba#Mid 1970s – mid-1990s|Deadbeat Honeymooners]], [[Extreme (band)|Extreme]], [[Sass Jordan]] and [[Steve Miller (musician)|Steve Miller]].&lt;ref name="WFPOstick"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ostick |first1=Stephen |title=Everything he does... |journal=Winnipeg Free Press |date=28 August 1992 |page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The park hosted the 1998 Canadian Triathlon Championships.&lt;ref name="CanadaGames"&gt;{{cite web |title=Venue: Birds Hill Provincial Park |url=https://www.canadagames.ca/2017/content/birds-hill-provincial-park |website=2017 Canada Games |accessdate=21 October 2018 |language=en |date=21 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The park was the location of the [[Road bicycle racing|road cycling]], [[triathlon]], and equestrian competitions during the [[1999 Pan American Games]].&lt;ref name="CanadaGames"/&gt;

In 2017, the park was the venue for the triathlon, road cycling and open water swimming events for the [[Canada Games]].&lt;ref name="CanadaGames"/&gt;

Retrieved on 2007-10-18&lt;/ref&gt; The Bravo Lake Formation is surprisingly undeformed by the Himalayan-scale forming event during the Trans-Hudsonian orogeny.

The [[stratigraphy]] of the Bravo Lake Formation starts with a basic section of iron-oxide rich [[sandstone]]s, [[psammite]]s, and semi-[[pelite]]s which cover a series of deformed [[pillow lava]]s which expand in viscosity towards the west, and volcanic/clastic deposits and [[ultramafic]] [[Sill (geology)|sills]]. The lower volcanic section is covered by [[garnet]] and [[diopside]] bearing [[Calc–silicate rock|calc–silicate]] layers and finely layered metasediments composed of coarse-grained [[actinolite]], [[hornblende]] and [[biotite]] followed by pelites and semi-pelites that are intruded by separate sills. In the [[Ridge Lake]] area, the volcanic belt includes an interlayered series of [[amphibolite]], [[gabbro]], [[Banded iron formation|iron formation]], sulfidic [[schist]] and metasediments.&lt;ref name="SI"/&gt;

Geochemical results of [[pillow lava]]s and chill boundaries along five transects across the volcanic belt suggest the existence of three chemically different [[magma]] types within the Bravo Lake Formation.&lt;ref name="SI"/&gt;

Lavas of the [[volcanic belt]] display [[Geochemistry|geochemical]] characteristics similar to modern ocean-island–basalt groups. They range from moderately to intensely fractionated. [[Rare-earth element|REE-profiles]] are similar to those from [[tholeiitic basalt]]s to extremely [[alkaline]] lavas in [[Hawaii]].&lt;ref name="SI"/&gt;

'''Canaan Valley Resort State Park''' is a [[state park]] in the [[Eastern United States|eastern]] [[United States]], within [[Canaan Valley, West Virginia|Canaan Valley]] in  [[Tucker County, West Virginia]].  Located in the highest valley east of the [[Mississippi River]], the park contains the second-largest inland [[wetland]] area in the United States.&lt;ref name=Phillips&gt;{{cite book | last = Phillips | first = John | title = Ski and Snowboard America - Mid-Atlantic: The Complete Guide to Downhill Skiing, Snowboarding, Cross Country Skiing, Snow Tubing, and More Throughout the Mid-Atlantic Region | publisher = Globe Pequot Press | year = 2001 | location = Guilford, Connecticut |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VckrqufkcpMC&amp;pg=PA201&amp;dq=isbn:076270845X| isbn = 0-7627-0845-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The valley featured the first commercial ski development in West Virginia.

==History==
In 1950 and 1951, members of the [[Washington Ski Club]] identified the Canaan Valley side of [[Cabin Mountain]] as an opportune place for ski development,&lt;ref name=Lesher&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whitegrass.com/downloads/CV.ski.history.story.pdf.pdf|title=The Early History of Skiing in Canaan Valley|publisher=Chronicles of the Tucker County Highlands History and Education Project|date=April 2008|accessdate=2009-02-27| last=Lesher |first=Dave}}&lt;/ref&gt; based on pilots' reports.  Because of its protection from the sun, snow on that side of the mountain often remains until April or later.

The club began slope development in the early 1950s,&lt;ref&gt;Fansler, Homer Floyd (1962), ''History of Tucker County, West Virginia'', [[Parsons, West Virginia]]: [[McClain Printing Company]], pg 595-6&lt;/ref&gt; signing a ten year operational lease with local landowners in 1954.&lt;ref name=Lesher/&gt;  Their slope, named '''Cabin Mountain Ski Area''', featured two [[rope tow]]s on {{convert|40|acre|km2}} of terrain stretching from route 32 to a height of {{convert|3600|ft|m}}.&lt;ref name=lost&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dcski.com/lostareas/viewlostprofile.php?id=31#comments|title=DCSki Lost Ski Area Profile: Weiss Knob Ski Area|publisher=www.dcski.com|accessdate=2009-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Runs extended {{convert|.25|mi|m}} down a slope with a vertical drop of {{convert|300|ft|m}}.  It was the first commercial ski establishment south of the [[Mason–Dixon line]].  The ski area closed in 1962.&lt;ref name=Lesher/&gt;

In 1955, [[University of Virginia School of Law]] student Robert Barton established '''Weiss Knob Ski Area''', climbing the slope of Weiss Knob above the Cabin Mountain site to a height of {{convert|3900|ft|m}}.  It featured {{convert|60|acre|km2}} of terrain serviced by a [[T-bar lift|T-bar]] as well as three [[Ski tow|rope tows]].&lt;ref name=lost/&gt;  This site was acquired by the state of West Virginia in 1959,&lt;ref name=Lesher/&gt; so Barton reopened "Weiss Knob Ski Area" at a new site on Cabin Mountain's Bald Knob.  Opening in fall 1959, the new site featured four rope tows and the first [[snowmaking]] equipment in West Virginia; in its first season, {{convert|412|in|cm}} of snow fell, burying the equipment and closing the facility for the year.&lt;ref name=Cox&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.com/static/specialsections/lookingback/lb0301b.htm |archive-url=https://archive.is/20060318140058/http://www.dailymail.com/static/specialsections/lookingback/lb0301b.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2006-03-18 |title=First came the springs then the rafting and skiing then the lure of the outdoors then the festivals, then the . . .|publisher=Charleston Daily Mail|date=1999-03-01|accessdate=2009-02-23|last=Cox|first=Therese S. }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The resort remained open until 1970, when the impending opening of Canaan Valley Resort prompted Barton to go out of business.&lt;ref name=Lesher/&gt;  This new ski area was actually a redevelopment of the original Weiss Knob site;&lt;ref name=lost/&gt; the second Weiss Knob site would be re-opened as the second home of [[White Grass Ski Touring Center]] in 1981.&lt;ref name=Taylor&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.roanoke.com/roatimes/news/story144279.html|title=Trail leads to good times|publisher=The Roanoke Times|date=2003-02-09|accessdate=2009-03-01|last=Taylor|first=Mark|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130201111842/http://www.roanoke.com/roatimes/news/story144279.html|archivedate=2013-02-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1957, the state of West Virginia made its first land acquisition with an eye toward further developing a ski industry in West Virginia. Sarah Maude Thompson Kaemmerling granted {{convert|3149|acre|km2}} to the state in the 1950s for the formation of a state park&lt;ref name=Lesher/&gt; with the stipulation that the state make a matching {{convert|3000|acre|km2|adj=on}} acquisition.&lt;ref name=Phillips/&gt;  The state would go on to claim more than 30 properties between 1964 and 1970.&lt;ref name=Lesher/&gt;  It was not until 1971, however, that the Canaan Valley Resort State Park was established centering on the ski slopes at the southern end of the Valley. In 1972, an 18-hole [[golf]] course was also constructed there. The lodge at Canaan Valley Resort State Park Lodge opened in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;Michael, Edwin Daryl (2002), ''A Valley Called Canaan: 1885-2002'', Parsons, West Virginia: McClain Printing Company, pp 221-222.&lt;/ref&gt;

The park has been very successful and several private ski operations have opened nearby and in other parts of the state as well.

Canaan Valley Resort opened for skiing in 1971, on the original site of Weiss Knob Ski Area.  It offers 49 ski trails, one [[terrain park]], and a [[snow tubing]] area.  A [[chairlift]] and magic carpet access the resort's beginner skiing area, on the far right of the mountain (facing up the slope).  Other than this terrain and one long green trail running from the summit to the resort base, practically all the mountain terrain is marked more difficult or most difficult.  These blue and black slopes generally descend the mountain at the same pitch, regardless of their difficulty marking.&lt;ref name=Phillips/&gt;  A triple chair and quad chair access the resort summit; the latter also has a mid-mountain station, which is the point beginners are encouraged to offload as the upper part of the mountain is steeper.

===Amenities and recreation===
Canaan Valley Resort State Park features a 160 room lodge, plus 23 cabins &amp; cottages, and 34 campsites.  The park also provides hiking trails, bike trails, ski area, and 18 hole championship-level golf course. In 2016, a paragliding launch site was opened on Cabin Mountain, and is accessible from the ski lift.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.parsonsadvocate.com/canaan-valley-resort-now-open-paragliding/|title=Canaan Valley Resort is now open to Paragliding|last=Advocate|first=Parsons|website=www.parsonsadvocate.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Cape Floristic Region''' is a [[floristic region]] located near the southern tip of [[South Africa]]. It is the only floristic region of the Cape (South African) Floristic Kingdom, and includes only one [[floristic province]], known as the Cape Floristic Province.

The Cape Floristic Region, the smallest of the six recognised [[Phytochorion|floral kingdoms]] of the world, is an area of extraordinarily high diversity and [[endemism]], and is home to over 9,000 vascular plant species, of which 69 percent are endemic.&lt;ref name="Odendaal 2008" /&gt; Much of this diversity is associated with the [[fynbos]] biome, a Mediterranean-type, fire-prone shrubland.&lt;ref name="Odendaal 2008" /&gt; The economical worth of fynbos biodiversity, based on harvests of fynbos products (e.g. [[wildflower]]s) and [[eco-tourism]], is estimated to be in the region of [[South African rand|R]]77 million a year.&lt;ref name="Odendaal 2008" /&gt; Thus, it is clear that the Cape Floristic Region has both economic and intrinsic biological value as a [[biodiversity hotspot]].&lt;ref name="Odendaal 2008"&gt;Odendaal L. J., Haupt T. M. &amp; Griffiths C. L. (2008). "The alien invasive land snail ''Theba pisana'' in the West Coast National Park: Is there cause for concern?". ''[[Koedoe – African Protected Area Conservation and Science]]'' '''50'''(1): 93-98. [http://www.koedoe.co.za/index.php/koedoe/article/view/153 abstract], {{DOI|10.4102/koedoe.v50i1.153}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

__TOC__

== Location and description ==
Home to the greatest non-tropical concentration of higher plant species in the world, the region is the only hotspot that encompasses an entire floral kingdom, and holds five of South Africa’s 12 endemic plant families and 160 endemic genera. Covering 78,555&amp;nbsp;km², Cape Floristic Region hotspot is located entirely within the borders of South Africa. It is one of the five temperate Mediterranean-type systems on the hotspots list, and is one of only two hotspots that encompass an entire floral kingdom (the other being [[New Caledonia]]){{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}. The Region covers the [[Mediterranean climate]] region of South Africa in the [[Western Cape]] in the southwestern corner of the country, and extends eastward into the [[Eastern Cape]], a transitional zone between the winter rainfall region to the west and the summer-rainfall region to the east in [[KwaZulu-Natal]].

== Flora ==
Most of the region is covered with [[fynbos]], a [[sclerophyllous]] [[shrubland]] occurring on acid sands or nutrient-poor soils derived from Table Mountain sandstones (Cape Supergroup). Fynbos is home to a diverse plethora of plant species including many members of the protea family ([[Proteaceae]]), heath family ([[Ericaceae]]), and reed family of restios ([[Restionaceae]]). Other vegetation types are [[sandveld]], a soft coastal [[scrubland]] found mostly on the west-facing coast of the [[Western Cape Province]], on tertiary sands. [[Renosterveld]] is a grassy shrubland dominated by members of the daisy family ([[Asteraceae]], particularly [[renosterbos]] (''Elytropappus rhinocerotis''), graminoids and geophytes, occurring on the base-rich shaley soils of the coastal forelands. Small pockets of [[Afromontane]] forest ([[Southern Afrotemperate Forest]]) can be found in humid and sheltered areas.

According to Takhtajan (1978), the following families are endemic or subendemic to the region: [[Grubbiaceae]], [[Roridulaceae]], [[Bruniaceae]], [[Penaeaceae]], [[Greyiaceae]], [[Geissolomataceae]], Retziaceae (''[[Retzia]]'') and [[Stilbaceae]].&lt;ref&gt;Тахтаджян А.

== Ecology ==
The [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] divides the Cape floristic region into three [[ecoregion]]s, the [[Lowland fynbos and renosterveld]], [[Montane fynbos and renosterveld]] and the [[Albany thickets]].

The fynbos ecoregions are designated one of the [[Global 200]] priority ecoregions for conservation. [[Conservation International]] declared the Cape floristic region to be a [[biodiversity hotspot]].

It is thought that the Cape Floristic Region is experiencing one of the most rapid rates of extinction in the world due to habitat loss, land degradation, and invasive alien plants.&lt;ref name="extincitionCap"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.iol.co.za/news/south-africa/western-cape/cape-is-world-s-extinction-capital-1.1735307#.U_Sh8PmSySo | title=Cape is world's extinction capital | date=14 August 2014 | accessdate=20 August 2014 | author=South African Press Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== World Heritage Site ==
[[File:Biodiversity Hotspots.svg|thumb|upright=1.2|[[Biodiversity hotspot]]s of the world showing the Cape Floristic Region (number 12)]]
In 2004, the "Cape Floral Region Protected Areas" were inscribed as a [[World Heritage Site]]. The site includes eight representative protected areas:
* [[Table Mountain National Park]]
* [[Cederberg Wilderness Area]]
* [[Groot Winterhoek Wilderness Area]]
* [[Boland, Western Cape|Boland]] Mountain Complex ([[Limietberg Nature Reserve]], [[Jonkershoek Nature Reserve]], [[Assegaaibosch Nature Reserve]], [[Hottentots Holland Nature Reserve]], [[Kogelberg Nature Reserve]])

According to classical sources{{who|date=April 2014}}, the ancient [[Celts]] were [[Animism|animists]]. They honoured the forces of nature, saw the world as inhabited by many spirits, and saw [[Celtic polytheism|the Divine]] manifesting in aspects of the natural world.&lt;ref name="Wood"&gt;Juliette Wood. 'Introduction.' In Squire, C. (2000). ''The mythology of the British Islands: an introduction to Celtic myth, legend, poetry and romance''. London &amp; Ware: UCL &amp; Wordsworth Editions Ltd. {{ISBN|1-84022-500-9}}. Pages 12&amp;ndash;13&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview: the sacred land==
The [[Celts]] of the ancient world believed that many [[animism|spirits]] and [[Polytheism|divine beings]] inhabited the world around them, and that humans could establish a rapport with these beings.&lt;ref name="GreenAnimals"&gt;[[Miranda Green (academic)|Miranda Green]]. (1992:196) ''Animals in Celtic life and myth''. London: Routledge. {{ISBN|0-415-05030-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[archaeology|archaeological]] and the [[Celtic literature|literary record]] indicate that ritual practice in Celtic societies lacked a clear distinction between the sacred and profane; rituals, offerings, and correct behaviour maintained a balance between gods, spirits and humans and harnessed supernatural forces for the benefit of the community.&lt;ref name="Wood"/&gt;

The [[Celtic polytheism|pagan Celts]] perceived the presence of the supernatural as integral to, and interwoven with, the material world. Every [[mountain]], [[river]], [[spring (hydrosphere)|spring]], [[marsh]], [[tree]] and [[cliff|rocky outcrop]] was inspirited.&lt;ref name="GreenExploring29"&gt;Miranda J. Green. (2005) ''Exploring the world of the druids.'' London: Thames &amp; Hudson. {{ISBN|0-500-28571-3}}. Page 29&lt;/ref&gt; While the polytheistic cultures of [[Culture of Greece|ancient Greece]] and [[Culture of ancient Rome|Rome]] revolved around [[Urban culture|urban life]], ancient Celtic society was predominantly [[Rural sociology|rural]]. The close link with the natural world is reflected in what we know of the religious systems of Celtic Europe during the late 1st millennium BCE and early 1st millennium CE. As in many [[polytheistic]] systems, the local spirits honoured were those of both the wild and cultivated landscapes and their inhabitants. As Anne Ross observed, "god-types, as opposed to individual universal Gaulish deities, are to be looked for as an important feature of the religion of the Gauls ... and the evidence of [[epigraphy]] strongly supports this conclusion."&lt;ref&gt;Anne Ross, "Chain Symbolism in Pagan Celtic Religion" ''Speculum'' '''34'''.1 (January 1959:39–59) p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; As what some may consider spirits are considered by other authors to be deities, the [[list of Celtic deities]] derived from local inscriptions can at times be rather long.

The ancient Celts venerated the spirits who inhabited local [[mountain]]s, [[forest]]s and springs. Certain animals were seen as messengers of the spirits or gods.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} In Tribal territories, the [[mortuary enclosure|ground and waters which received the dead]] were imbued with sanctity and revered by their living relatives.&lt;ref name="GreenExploring24"&gt;Miranda J. Green. (2005) ''Exploring the world of the druids.'' London: Thames &amp; Hudson. {{ISBN|0-500-28571-3}}. Page 24&lt;/ref&gt; Sanctuaries were sacred spaces separated from the ordinary world, often in natural locations such as springs, [[sacred grove]]s or lakes. Many [[topography|topographical]] features were honored as the abodes of powerful spirits or deities, with geographical features named for tutelary deities. Offerings of jewelry, weapons or foodstuffs were placed in offering pits and bodies of water dedicated to these beings. These offerings linked the donor to the place and spirits in a concrete way.&lt;ref name="Wood"/&gt;

== Honouring the waters ==
[[File:River Shannon from Drumsna bridge.jpg|thumb|250px|left|The River Shannon, ([[Irish language|Irish]]:''Abhainn na Sionainne'') [[County Leitrim]], [[Ireland]] ]]
The spirits of watery places were honoured as givers of life and as links between the physical realm and the [[other world]]. [[Sequana]], for example, seems to have embodied the [[River Seine]] at its spring source, and [[Sulis]] appears to have been one and the same as the [[hot spring]] at [[Bath, Somerset]], (Roman [[Aquae Sulis]]) not simply its guardian or possessor.&lt;ref name="GreenExploring24"/&gt; In Ireland, the tutelary goddesses [[Boann]] and Sionnan give their names to the rivers [[River Boyne|Boyne]] and [[River Shannon|Shannon]], and the tales of these goddesses are the origin stories of the rivers themselves. The threefold goddess [[Brigid|Brighid]] is associated with a number of [[clootie well|holy wells]] and [[Morrígan|The Morrígan]] is connected with the River Unius.&lt;ref name="Sjoestedt"&gt;[[Marie-Louise Sjoestedt|Sjoestedt, Marie-Louise]] (originally published in French, 1940, reissued 1982) ''Gods and Heroes of the Celts''. Translated by Myles Dillon, Berkeley, CA, Turtle Island Foundation {{ISBN|0-913666-52-1}}, pp. 24–46.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is abundant evidence for the veneration of water by the Celts and indeed by their Bronze Age forebears. In the [[Pre-Roman Iron Age]], [[lake]]s, [[river]]s, [[spring (hydrosphere)|springs]] and [[bog]]s received special offerings of metalwork, wooden objects, animals and, occasionally, of human beings. By the Roman period, the names of some water-deities were recorded on inscriptions or were included in contemporary texts. The ancient name for the [[River Marne]] was [[Dea Matrona|Matrona]] 'Great Mother;' the [[Seine]] was [[Sequana]]; the [[Severn]], Sabrina; the [[River Wharfe|Wharfe]], [[Verbeia]]; the [[Saône]], [[Souconna]], and there are countless others. Natural springs were foci for healing cults: Sulis was prayed to as a healer at [[Bath, Somerset|Aquae Sulis]] and the goddess [[Arnemetia]] was hailed as a healer at [[Buxton|Aquae Arnemetiae]].&lt;ref name="GreenExploring25"/&gt; [[Nemausus]], for example, was not only the [[Gaulish language|Gallic]] name for the town of [[Nîmes]] but also that of its presiding [[spring (hydrosphere)|spring]]-god. He had a set of three female counterparts, the [[Nemausicae]]. In the same region, the town of [[Glanum]] possessed a god called [[Glanis]]: an [[altar]] from a sacred spring is inscribed 'to Glanis and the [[Glanicae]]'.&lt;ref name="GreenExploring29"/&gt;

== Spirits of the weather and the skies ==
[[File:Corryvreckan.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The Corryvreckan whirpool ([[Scottish Gaelic]]: ''Coire Bhreacain'' - 'cauldron of the plaid') washtub of the [[Cailleach]] ]]
[[Meteorology|Meteorological]] patterns and phenomena, especially wind, rain and [[thunder]], were acknowledged as inspirited and propitiated. Inscribed dedications and iconography in the Roman period show that these spirits were personifications of natural forces. [[Taranis]]'s name indicates not that he was the god of thunder but that he actually was thunder.&lt;ref name="GreenExploring24"/&gt; Archaeological evidence suggests that the thunder was perceived as especially potent. Inscriptions to [[Taranis]] the 'Thunderer' have been found in [[Great Britain|Britain]], [[Gaul]], [[Germany]] and the former [[Yugoslavia]] and the Roman poet [[Marcus Annaeus Lucanus|Lucan]] mentions him as a savage god who demanded [[human sacrifice]]. In the insular Celtic lands, [[Lugh]] is seen as a god of the storms, as are the [[Cailleach]]an - Scottish storm hags&lt;ref name="McNeill"&gt;{{cite book | first =F. Marian | last =McNeill | authorlink = | year =1959 | title =The Silver Bough, Vol.2: A Calendar of Scottish National Festivals, Candlemas to Harvest Home  | chapter = | editor = | others = | edition = | pages =20–1 | publisher =William MacLellan | location =Glasgow| isbn =0-85335-162-7 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McNeill2"&gt;{{cite book | first =F.

This process is said to take three days, during which the roar of the coming tempest is heard as far away as {{convert|20|mi|km|spell=in}} inland. When she is finished, her plaid is pure white and snow covers the land.&lt;ref name="McNeill"/&gt;

From the early [[Bronze Age]], people in much of temperate Europe used the [[spoke]]d [[wheel]] to represent [[Taranis]]. The Romans imported their own celestial god, [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]], to continental Celtic lands by ''[[interpretatio romana]]'', and his imagery was merged with that of a native deity to produce a hybrid sky-deity who resembled the Roman god but who had additional solar attributes.&lt;ref name="GreenExploring25"&gt;Miranda J. Green. (2005) ''Exploring the world of the druids.'' London: Thames &amp; Hudson. {{ISBN|0-500-28571-3}}. Page 25&lt;/ref&gt; Altars decorated with wheels were set up by Roman soldiers stationed at [[Hadrian's Wall]], and also by supplicants in [[Cologne]] and [[Nîmes]].&lt;ref name="GreenExploring29"/&gt;

== Sacred trees ==
{{main|Celtic sacred trees}}
The Celts believed that trees had spirits and [[tree worship|revered certain trees]]. The most sacred trees of Ireland were the bíle trees - old, sacred trees that stood in a central area and were often the social and ceremonial meeting place for a tribe or village.&lt;ref name="Rees1"&gt;{{cite book | first =Alwyn | last =Rees | authorlink = |author2=Brinley Rees | year =1998 | title =Celtic Heritage: Ancient Tradition in Ireland and Wales  | chapter = | editor = | others = | edition = | pages =120 | publisher =Thames and Hudson | location =New York | isbn =0-500-27039-2 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Dindsenchas]] (lore of Irish places), the five sacred Bíles of Ireland were the [[Ash tree|Ash]] of Tortu, the Bole of Ross (a [[yew tree]]); the [[Oak tree|Oak]] of Mugna, and the Ash of Dathi. These trees were associated with the five Irish provinces then in existence.&lt;ref name="Rees1"/&gt;

== Animal omens ==
Among both the Continental and Insular Celts, the behaviour of certain animals and birds were observed for omens,{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} and certain spirits were closely associated with particular animals. The names of [[Artio]] the [[Ursidae|ursine]] goddess and [[Epona]] the [[equine]] goddess are based on [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] words for 'bear' and 'horse', respectively.&lt;ref name="GreenExploring24"/&gt; In Ireland, the [[Morrígan]] is associated with [[crows]], [[wolves]] and [[horse]]s, among other creatures, and in Scotland [[Brighid]]'s animals include [[snakes]] and [[cattle]]. Certain creatures were observed to have particular physical and mental qualities and characteristics, and distinctive patterns of behaviour. An animal like a [[stag]] or [[horse]] could be admired for its [[beauty]], [[speed]] or [[virility]]. [[Dog]]s were seen to be keen-scented, good at hunting, guarding and healing themselves. [[Snake]]s were seen to be emblematic of long (possibly eternal) life, being able to shed their skin and renew themselves. [[Deer]] (who shed antlers) suggest cycles of growth;&lt;ref name="Wood"/&gt; in Ireland they are sacred to the goddess [[Flidais]], while in Scotland they are guarded by the [[Cailleach]].  [[Beaver]]s were seen to be skillful workers in [[wood]]. Thus admiration and acknowledgment for a beast's essential nature led easily to reverence of those qualities and abilities which humans did not possess at all or possessed only partially.&lt;ref name="GreenAnimals"/&gt;

== The hunt ==
[[Hunting]] deities, whose role acknowledges the economic importance of animals and the ritual of the hunt, highlight a different relationship to nature. The animal elements in half-human, antlered deities suggest that the forest and its denizens possessed a numinous quality as well as an economic value.&lt;ref name="Wood"/&gt;

Hunter-gods were venerated among the Continental Celts, and they often seem to have had an ambivalent role as protector both of the hunter and the prey, not unlike the functions of [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]] and [[Artemis]] in [[Religion in ancient Greece|classical mythology]].&lt;ref name="GreenExploring29"/&gt; From [[Gaul]], the armed deer-hunter depicted on an image from the temple of [[Le Donon]] in the [[Vosges]] lays his hands in [[benediction]] on the antlers of his stag companion. The hunter-god from [[Le Touget]] in [[Gers]] carries a hare tenderly in his arms. [[Arduinna]], the eponymous boar-goddess of the [[Ardennes]], rides her ferocious quarry, knife in hand, whilst the boar-god of [[Euffigneix]] in the [[Haute-Marne]] is portrayed with the motif of a [[boar]] with [[bristle]]s erect, striding along his torso, which implies conflation between the human animal perception of divinity.&lt;ref name="GreenExploring29"/&gt; [[Arawn]] of [[Welsh mythology]] may represent the remnants of a similar hunter-god of the forests of [[Dyfed]]. Additionally, in Welsh mythology the hunting of a sacred stag often leads the hunters into the Otherworld.

As with many traditional societies, the hunt was probably hedged about with prohibitions and rituals. The Greek author [[Arrian]], writing in the 2nd century CE, said that the Celts never went hunting without the gods' blessing and that they made payment of domestic animals to the supernatural powers in reparation for their theft of wild creatures from the landscape. Hunting itself may have been perceived as a symbolic, as well as practical, activity in which the spilling of blood led not only to the death of the beast but also to the earth's nourishment and replenishment.&lt;ref name="GreenExploring30"&gt;Miranda J. Green. (2005) ''Exploring the world of the druids.'' London: Thames &amp; Hudson. {{ISBN|0-500-28571-3}}. Page 30&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Conflict minerals 961w.jpg|thumb|Four common conflict minerals, clockwise from top left: [[coltan]], [[cassiterite]], [[gold]] ore, and [[wolframite]].]]
'''Conflict resources''' are [[natural resource]]s extracted in a [[conflict zone]] and sold to perpetuate the fighting.&lt;ref&gt;p.8, Conflict and Development: Peacebuilding and Post-conflict Resolution; Sixth Report of Session 2005–06, Great Britain: Parliament: House of Commons: International Development Committee, The Stationery Office, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; There is both statistical and anecdotal evidence that belligerent accessibility to precious commodities can prolong conflicts (a "[[Resource curse#Conflict|resource curse]]").&lt;ref&gt;Philippe Le Billon, "Fuelling War: Natural Resources and Armed Conflicts", Adelphi Paper 373, IISS &amp; Routledge, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael Ross,"How Do Natural Resources Influence Civil War?

The four most commonly mined '''conflict minerals''' (known as 3TGs, from their initials)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.assentcompliance.com/conflict-minerals-consulting-services/|title=Assent Compliance|author=|date=|website=Assent Compliance}}&lt;/ref&gt; are [[cassiterite]] (for [[tin]]), [[wolframite]] (for [[tungsten]]), [[coltan]] (for [[tantalum]]), and [[gold]] ore, which are extracted from the eastern Congo, and passed through a variety of intermediaries before being purchased. These minerals are essential in the manufacture of a variety of devices, including [[consumer electronics]] such as mobile phones, laptops, and MP3 players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Elizabeth |last=Dias |date=July 24, 2009 |title=First Blood Diamonds, Now Blood Computers? |journal=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |publisher=[[Time Warner]] |url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1912594,00.html |accessdate=December 16, 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5v1B1lxV6?url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0%2C8599%2C1912594%2C00.html |archivedate=December 16, 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The extraction and sale of [[blood diamond]]s, also known as "conflict diamonds", is a better-known phenomenon which occurs under virtually identical conditions. Even [[petroleum]] can be a conflict resource; [[Oil production and smuggling in ISIL|ISIS used oil revenue]] to finance its military and terrorist activities.

International efforts to reduce trade in conflict resources, tried to reduce incentives to extract and fight over them. For example, in the United States, the 2010 [[Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act]]&lt;ref&gt;Section 1502, known as the "Conflict Mineral Law", to be enforced by the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]]&lt;/ref&gt; required manufacturers to audit their [[supply chain]]s and report use of conflict minerals.  In 2015 a US [[United States court of appeals|federal appeals court]] struck down some aspects of the reporting requirements as a violation of [[Corporate personhood|corporations’ freedom of speech]], but left others in place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R43639.pdf |title=Conflict Minerals and Resource Extraction: Dodd-Frank, SEC Regulations, and Legal Challenges |author=Michael V.

== History ==
The concept of 'conflict resource', or 'conflict [[commodity]]' emerged in the late 1990s, initially in relation to the '[[conflict diamonds]]' that were financing rebellions in Angola and [[Sierra Leone]]. (The media often called these '[[blood diamonds]]'.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

=== Conventions ===
The concept was first officially discussed by the [[UN General Assembly]] in the context of 'conflict diamonds':&lt;ref&gt;[http://mmsd1.mms.nrcan.gc.ca/kimberleyprocess/UN_Resolution_e.pdf UNGA Resolution 55/56 (2001)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061108001135/http://mmsd1.mms.nrcan.gc.ca/kimberleyprocess/UN_resolution_e.pdf |date=2006-11-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[UN Security Council]] has since referred to conflict resources in several resolutions.{{which|date=May 2016}}

[[Global Witness]] has called for an international standardized definition to facilitate a more systematic application of UN resolutions, the prevention of complicity in abuses during hostilities by commercial entities exploiting or trading in conflict resources, and the prosecution of [[war profiteer]]s suspected of supporting or abetting war criminals.[https://web.archive.org/web/20071010161842/http://www.humansecuritybulletin.info/page434.htm]"

== Conflict minerals ==

The four most prominent conflict minerals, for example codified in the U.S. Conflict Minerals Law, are:

*'''Columbite-tantalite''' (or ''[[coltan]]'', the colloquial African term) is the metal ore from which the element [[tantalum]] is extracted.  Tantalum is used primarily for the production of [[tantalum capacitor]]s, particularly for applications requiring high performance, a small compact format and high reliability, from [[hearing aid]]s and [[pacemaker]]s, to [[airbag]]s, [[GPS]], ignition systems and anti-lock braking systems in automobiles, through to laptop computers, mobile phones, video game consoles, video cameras and digital cameras.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tantalum – Raw Materials and Processing |url=http://tanb.org/tantalum |publisher=Tantalum-Niobium International Study Center |accessdate=December 16, 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5v1BooEpq?url=http://tanb.org/tantalum |archivedate=December 16, 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In its carbide form, tantalum possesses significant hardness and wear resistance properties. As a result, it is used in jet engine/turbine blades, drill bits, end mills and other tools.
*'''Cassiterite''' is the chief ore needed to produce [[tin]], essential for the production of tin cans and the [[solder]] on the circuit boards of electronic equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tin |url=http://www.mii.org/Minerals/phototin.html |publisher=Mineral Information Institute |accessdate=December 16, 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5v1C3xwLJ?url=http://www.mii.org/Minerals/phototin.html |archivedate=December 16, 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tin is also commonly a component of biocides, fungicides and as tetrabutyl tin/tetraoctyl tin, an intermediate in [[polyvinyl chloride]] (PVC) and high performance paint manufacturing.
*'''[[Wolframite]]''' is an important source of the element [[tungsten]]. Tungsten is a very dense metal and is frequently used for this property, such as in fishing weights, dart tips and golf club heads. Like [[tantalum carbide]], [[tungsten carbide]] possesses hardness and wear resistance properties and is frequently used in applications like metalworking tools, drill bits and milling. Smaller amounts are used to substitute lead in "green ammunition".&lt;ref name="production"&gt;{{cite web|title=Tungsten |first=Kim B. |last=Shedd |url=http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/tungsten/680400.pdf |publisher=[[United States Geological Survey]] |year=2000 |accessdate=June 18, 2008 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5v1CK1wyQ?url=http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/tungsten/680400.pdf |archivedate=December 16, 2010 |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Minimal amounts are used in electronic devices, including the vibration mechanism of cell phones.
*'''Gold''' is used in jewelry, electronics, and dental products. It is also present in some chemical compounds used in certain semiconductor manufacturing processes.

These are sometimes referred to as "''the 3T's and gold''", ''3TG'', or even simply the "''3T's''".  Under the US Conflict Minerals Law, additional minerals may be added to this list in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-40-10/s74010-26.htm |title=Remarks on not adding niobium to the list |publisher=Sec.gov |date=2011-01-18 |accessdate=2014-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Armed conflict and mineral resource looting by the [[Military of the Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congolese National Army]] and various armed rebel groups, including the [[Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda]] (FDLR) and the [[National Congress for the Defense of the People]] (CNDP), a proxy Rwandan militia group, has occurred throughout the late 20th century and the early 21st century. Additionally, the looting of the Congo's natural resources is not limited to domestic actors. During the Congo Wars ([[First Congo War]] (1996–1997) and [[Second Congo War]] (1998–2003)), Rwanda, Uganda and Burundi particularly profited from the Congo's resources. These governments continued to smuggle resources out of the Congo to this day.{{Citation needed|reason=likely true, but a serious charge that requires proof|date=May 2016}}

The profits from the sale of these minerals have financed fighting in the Second Congo War and ongoing follow-on conflicts. Control of lucrative mines has also itself become a military objective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Witness Report: 'Faced with a gun, what can you do?' |url=http://www.globalwitness.org/sites/default/files/pdfs/report_en_final_0.pdf |publisher=[[Global Witness]] |date=July 21, 2009 |accessdate=December 16, 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5v1AhKWsY?url=http://www.globalwitness.org/sites/default/files/pdfs/report_en_final_0.pdf |archivedate=December 16, 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mines ===
Mines, in eastern Congo, are often located far from populated areas in remote and dangerous regions. A recent study by International Peace Information Service (IPIS) indicates that armed groups are present at more than 50% of mining sites. At many sites, armed groups illegally tax, extort, and coerce civilians to work.  Miners, including children, work up to 48-hour shifts amidst mudslides and tunnel collapses that kill many.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = Congo's Riches, Looted by Renegade Troops |first = Lydia |last = Polgreen |url = https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/16/world/africa/16congo.html?&amp;st=cse&amp;scp=1&amp;pagewanted=all |newspaper = [[The New York Times]] |publisher = [[The New York Times Company]] |date = November 15, 2008 |accessdate = December 16, 2010 |archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/5v1BQBTW8?url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/16/world/africa/16congo.html?_r=1&amp;&amp;st=cse&amp;scp=1&amp;pagewanted=all |archivedate = December 16, 2010 |deadurl = yes |df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The groups are often affiliated with rebel groups, or with the Congolese National Army, but both use rape and violence to control the local population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rape Crisis in East Congo Tied to Mining Activity |first=Dominique |last=Soguel |url=http://www.womensenews.org/story/090601/rape-crisis-in-east-congo-tied-mining-activity |work=[[Women's eNews]] |date=June 1, 2009 |accessdate=December 16, 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5v1Bd15JZ?url=http://www.womensenews.org/story/090601/rape-crisis-in-east-congo-tied-mining-activity |archivedate=December 16, 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== United States law ==
In April 2009, Senator [[Sam Brownback]] (R-KS) introduced the Congo Conflict Minerals Act of 2009 (S. 891)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/111th-congress/senate-bill/891|title=S.891 - 111th Congress (2009-2010): Congo Conflict Minerals Act of 2009|first=Brownback,|last=Sam|date=23 April 2009|website=www.congress.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; to require electronics companies to verify and disclose their sources of cassiterite, wolframite, and tantalum. This legislation died in committee. However, Brownback added similar language as Section 1502 of the [[Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act]], which passed Congress and was signed into law by President [[Barack Obama]] on July 21, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.steptoe.com/publications-7050.html New Corporate Social Responsibility Mandate Related to Conflict Materials in the New Financial Reform Bill Could Affect Many Companies]" (July 20, 2010). Steptoe &amp; Johnson LLP.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC) draft regulations to implement the Conflict Mineral Law, published in the [[Federal Register]] of December 23, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;75 Fed. Reg. 80948 – 80975&lt;/ref&gt; would have required U.S. and certain foreign companies to report and make public their use of so-called "conflict minerals" from the Democratic Republic of the Congo or adjoining countries in their products. Comments on this proposal were extended until March 2, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.sec.gov/rules/proposed/2011/34-63793.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The comments on the proposal were reviewable by the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-40-10/s74010.shtml |title=Comments on File No. s7-40-10 |publisher=Sec.gov |date= |accessdate=November 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One report on the proposal&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://elmconsultinggroup.wordpress.com/2011/03/25/sec-provides-preview-of-april-15-final-rules-on-conflict-minerals-supply-chain-traceability/ |title=SEC Provides Preview of April 15 Final Rules on Conflict Minerals Supply Chain Traceability &amp;#124; Your EHS Connection |publisher=Elmconsultinggroup.wordpress.com |date=March 25, 2011 |accessdate=November 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; stated the following statistics for the submitted comments:
* Slightly more than 700 comment letters were submitted to SEC on the proposal;
* Approximately 65% of those were form letters or basic letters from the general public supporting the rule's intent;
* The remaining 35% (roughly 270) represent views of businesses, trade/industry associations, the investment/financial community, professional auditing firms, and other relevant governmental entities; and
* Of those 270 comments, an estimated 200 contained substantive and/or technical comments.
That report also contained what it calls a "preview of the final SEC regulations" synthesized from their detailed research and analysis of a large body of documents, reports and other information on the law, proposed regulation and the current budget/political setting facing the SEC in the current administration.

The final rule went into effect 13 November 2012.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/2012/34-67716.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The SEC rule did not go unnoticed by the international community, including entities seeking to undermine traceability efforts.  A report published by a metals trading publication illustrated one DRC ore/mineral flow method that has apparently been devised to thwart detection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://agmetalminer.com/2011/02/24/loophole-in-conflict-minerals-law-creates-opportunity-for-scrap-dealers/ |title=Loophole in Conflict Minerals Law Creates Opportunity for Scrap Dealers |publisher=Agmetalminer.com |date= |accessdate=November 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 15, 2011, the US State Department issued a statement&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/e/eeb/diamonds/docs/168632.htm |title=Statement Concerning Implementation of Section 1502 of the Dodd-Frank Legislation Concerning Conflict Minerals Due Diligence |publisher=State.gov |date= |accessdate=November 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the subject.  Section 1502(c) of the Law mandates that the [[United States Department of State|State Department]] work in conjunction with SEC on certain elements of conflict minerals policy development and support.

On October 23, 2012 U.S. State Dept Officials asserted that ultimately, it falls on the U.S. State Dept. to determine when this rule would no longer apply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=US Dept of State &amp; Intelleges Webinar |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h8H947wuCNI|publisher=Intelleges|accessdate=2013-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2014, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit struck down several parts of the SEC Rules as unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/04/14/us-court-sec-conflictminerals-idUSBREA3D13U20140414|title=U.S. appeals court finds conflict-minerals rule violates free speech|first=Sarah N.|last=Lynch|date=|website=reuters.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Auditing and reporting requirements ===
US Conflict Minerals Law contains two requirements that are closely connected: 
*independent third party supply chain traceability audits
* reporting of audit information to the public and SEC.

Even companies not directly regulated by the SEC will be impacted by the audit requirements because they will be pushed down through entire supply chains, including privately held and foreign-owned companies.

SEC estimated that 1,199 "issuers" (i.e., companies subject to filing other SEC reports) will be required to submit full conflict mineral reports.  This estimate was developed by finding the amount of tantalum produced by the DRC in comparison to global production (15% – 20%).  The Commission selected the higher figure of 20% and multiplied that by 6,000 (the total number of "issuers" SEC will be required to do initial product/process evaluations).&lt;ref&gt;75 Fed. Reg 80966&lt;/ref&gt;  This estimate does not account for the companies who supply materials to the "issuers" (but are not themselves SEC-regulated) but who will almost certainly be required to conduct conflict minerals audits to meet the demands of those customers.  Other estimates indicate that the total number of US companies likely impacted may exceed 12,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://agmetalminer.com/2011/02/25/conflict-minerals-law-supply-chain-due-diligence-and-impact-on-metal-buying-organizations-part-three/ |title=Conflict Minerals Law, Supply Chain Due Diligence and Impact on Metal Buying Organizations – Part Three |publisher=Agmetalminer.com |date= |accessdate=November 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study of the potential impact of the regulation in early 2011 by the ''[[IPC (electronics)|IPC – Association Connecting Electronic Industries]]'' trade association.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipc.org/ |title=Association Connecting Electronics Industries |publisher=IPC |date= |accessdate=November 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; was submitted with the association's comments to the SEC.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ipc.org/3.0_Industry/3.3_Gov_Relations/2011/IPC-SEC-NPRM-Comments-030311.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  The study states that the IPC survey respondents had a median of 163 direct suppliers.  Applying that number to the SEC's estimated number of impacted issuers results in the possibility of over 195,000 businesses that could be subject to some level of supply chain traceability effort.

==== Applicability in general ====
Under the law, companies have to submit an annual conflict minerals report to the SEC if: 
*(a) they are required to file reports with the SEC under the Exchange Act of 1934 
*(b) conflict minerals are ''necessary to the functionality or production of a product that they manufacture or contract to be manufactured.'' That statement contains two separate – but critical concepts: the purpose of the conflict mineral in the product/process, and the control that the company exerts over the manufacturing process/specifications.

A company would be deemed to contract an item to be manufactured if it:
*Exerts any influence over the manufacturing process; or,
*Offers a generic product under its own brand name or a separate brand name (regardless of whether the company has any influence over the manufacturing process) and the company contracted to have the product manufactured specifically for itself.

This language implied that some retailers who are not manufacturers might be subject to the audit and disclosure requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Sandler, Travis  |author2=Rosenberg, P.A. |title=Client Advisory: Retailers May Be Subject to Proposed SEC Conflict Mineral Reporting Requirements |date=December 23, 2010 |accessdate=May 1, 2016|url=http://www.strtrade.com/advisory.aspx?id=425}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Contracting to manufacture" a product requires some actual influence over the manufacturing of process that product, a determination based on facts and circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SEC Adopts Rule for Disclosing Use of Conflict Minerals|url=https://www.sec.gov/news/press/2012/2012-163.htm|publisher=SEC|accessdate=April 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A company is not to be deemed to have influence over the manufacturing process if it merely:
* Affixes its brand, marks, logo, or label to a generic product manufactured by a third party.
* Services, maintains, or repairs a product manufactured by a third party.
* Specifies or negotiates contractual terms with a manufacturer that do not directly relate to the manufacturing of the product.

The proposed regulations attempted to clarify that tools used in assembly and manufacturing will not trigger the law.&lt;ref&gt;75 Fed. Reg. 80953&lt;/ref&gt;  The intent was to cover minerals/metals in the final product only. Nothing specifically addresses intermediate chemical processes that use chemicals that contain conflict minerals.&lt;ref&gt;For instance, some electronic components use chemical solutions containing gold at some point in the manufacturing processes.  Tin is used during the chemical processes for manufacturing PVC and certain high performance paints/coatings.&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, neither the law nor the proposed regulation established a [[de minimis]] quantity or other form of materiality threshold that would preclude the applicability of the auditing/reporting requirements.&lt;ref&gt;75 Fed. Reg. 80963&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Supply chain traceability auditing ====

The law mandates the use of an "independent private sector auditor" to conduct the audits. SEC has proposed two different standards for the audits: the "reasonable inquiry" and the "[[due diligence]]".&lt;ref&gt;75 Fed. Reg. 80956&lt;/ref&gt;  Should the final rule include this structure, the reasonable inquiry would be the first step to determine if the company can on its own, using reasonable efforts and trustworthy information, make a reliable determination as to the source/origin of its tin, tantalum, tungsten and/or gold.  Where companies are unable to make such a determination for any reason, they would then be required to take the next step of the "due diligence", which is the independent private sector audit.

The statute specified that the audits be "conducted in accordance with standards established by the [[Comptroller General of the United States]], in accordance with rules promulgated by the Commission." This means that the same auditing standards that apply to other SEC auditing requirements will apply to conflict minerals audits &lt;ref name="Section 1502b"&gt;Section 1502(b).&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this language, SEC will have little discretion to allow companies to issue self-generated statements or certifications to satisfy the law.

Third party audits for conflict minerals supply chain traceability began in summer 2010 under the Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition (EICC), a US-based electronics manufacturing trade association.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eicc.info/PDF/PR%20Extractives%20Smelter%20Audit%20Launch%20FINAL.pdf] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111102203237/http://www.eicc.info/PDF/PR%20Extractives%20Smelter%20Audit%20Launch%20FINAL.pdf |date=November 2, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Under this program, EICC selected three audit firms to conduct the actual audits, with two of the three participating in the pilot audits in 2010. After concluding the pilot, one of the two firms involved in 2010 withdrew from the program specifically in response to the SEC's proposal and to reduce potential legal risks to the audited entities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sdcexec.com/web/online/Global-Focus-News/Conflict-Minerals-Sustainability-and-Audit-Services-to-Align-with-US-SEC-Audit-Standards/50$13230 |title=Find It: |publisher=Sdcexec.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neither the law nor the proposed regulations provide guidance on what will be considered an acceptable audit scope or process, preferring to allow companies the flexibility meeting the requirement in a manner that is responsive to their own individual business and supply chain.&lt;ref&gt;75 Fed. Reg. 80957&lt;/ref&gt;  At the same time, the law contains a provision that preserves the government's rights to deem any report, audit or other due diligence processes as being unreliable, and in such cases, the report shall not satisfy the requirements of the regulations,&lt;ref&gt;Section 1502(b)&lt;/ref&gt; further emphasizing the need for such audits to conform to established SEC auditing standards. Comments on the proposed regulation pointed out that, should SEC not specify an applicable audit standard, it cannot also be silent or ambiguous on the auditor standards as well, or the Commission will violate the plain language of the Law mandating "standards established by the Comptroller General of the United States".&lt;ref name="sec.gov"&gt;See numerous comments filed at https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-40-10/s74010.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;  It is generally expected that SEC will provide specificity on both the audit standard and the auditor standard.  SEC's proposal attempted to clarify its position on auditor requirements.&lt;ref&gt;75 Fed. Reg. 80958&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/home/0,3675,en_2649_201185_1_1_1_1_1,00.html |title=Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development |doi=10.1787/factbook-2010-en |publisher=Oecd.org |date=November 3, 2011 |accessdate=November 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; published its Guidance on conflict minerals supply chain traceability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/document/36/0,3746,en_2649_34889_44307940_1_1_1_1,00.html |title=OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict-Affected and High-Risk Areas |publisher=Oecd.org |date= |accessdate=November 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This guidance is gaining much momentum as "the" standard within US policy.  However, a recent critical analysis of the standard in comparison to existing US auditing standards under SEC highlighted a number of significant inconsistencies and conflict with relevant US standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://elmconsultinggroup.wordpress.com/2011/07/07/oecd-to-sec-make-us-the-conflict-minerals-due-diligenceaudit-standard-for-the-us/ |title=OECD to SEC: Make us the Conflict Minerals Due Diligence/Audit Standard for the US &amp;#124; Your EHS Connection |publisher=Elmconsultinggroup.wordpress.com |date=July 7, 2011 |accessdate=November 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Companies subject to the US law who implement the OECD Guidance without regard for the SEC auditing standards may face legal compliance risks.

==== Reporting and disclosure ====
Companies subject to the SEC reporting requirement would be required to disclose whether the minerals used in their products originated in the DRC or adjoining countries (as defined above). The law mandates that this reporting be submitted/made available annually. Many comments to the proposed regulation asked SEC to clarify whether the report must be "furnished"—meaning it is made available to SEC but not directly incorporated within the company's formal financial report—or "submitted"—meaning the report is directly incorporated into the financial report.&lt;ref name="sec.gov" /&gt;  At first glance, this may appear to be a minor point; however, this difference is very important in determining the audit/auditor standards and related liabilities.

If it is determined that none of the minerals originated in the DRC or adjoining countries, the report must include a statement to that effect and provide an explanation of the country of origin analysis that was used to arrive at the ultimate conclusion. On the other hand, if conflict minerals originating in the DRC or adjoining countries were used (or if it is not possible to determine the country of origin of the conflict minerals used), companies would be required to state as such in the annual report. In either case, companies would also be required to make this information public by posting their annual conflict minerals report on their websites, and providing the SEC with the internet addresses where the reports may be found. Further, the proposed regulations would require companies to maintain records relating to the country of origin of conflict minerals used in their products.

Media outlets have reported that many companies required to file Specialized Disclosure Reports to the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC) and any necessary conflict minerals reports for 2013 under the SEC’s conflict minerals rule are struggling to meet the June 2, 2014 report filing deadline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hills|first=Mark E.|title=Deadline Looms for Conflict Mineral Disclosure Requirements: Update for Suppliers of Reporting Companies|url=http://www.natlawreview.com/article/deadline-looms-conflict-mineral-disclosure-requirements-update-suppliers-reporting-c|accessdate=18 May 2014|newspaper=The National Law Review|date=16 May 2014|author2=Jacob A.

=== Criticism of the law ===
The law has been criticised for not addressing the root causes of the conflict, leaving to the Congolese government the responsibility for providing an environment in which companies can practice due diligence and legitimately purchase the minerals they need, when the reality is that mechanisms for transparency do not exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.undispatch.com/digging-deeper-into-the-dodd-frank-congo-blood-minerals-controversy | accessdate=Oct 17, 2011 | title=Digging Deeper Into the Dodd-Frank Congo ‘Blood Minerals’ Controversy | date=Aug 9, 2011 | work=UN Dispatch }}&lt;/ref&gt; The effect has been to halt legitimate mining ventures that provided livelihoods for people, reducing the Congo's legal exports of tantalum by 90%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/a-rule-aimed-at-warlords-upends-african-mines-08042011.html | accessdate=Oct 17, 2011 | title=A Rule Aimed at Warlords Upends African Mines | date=Aug 4, 2011 | work=Bloomberg Businessweek }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An investigation by the U.S. [[Government Accountability Office]] (GAO) found that most companies were unable to determine the source of their conflict minerals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gao.gov/assets/680/672051.pdf ''SEC CONFLICT MINERALS RULE: Initial Disclosures Indicate Most Companies Were Unable to Determine the Source of Their Conflict Minerals''], GAO-15-561: Published: Aug 18, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Technology manufacturers criticized a law which required them to label a product as not "DRC Conflict Free" as [[Government speech|compelled speech]], and in violation of the [[First Amendment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/opinions.nsf/D3B5DAF947A03F2785257CBA0053AEF8/$file/13-5252-1488184.pdf| accessdate=Nov 19, 2014 | title=National Association of Manufacturers v.

== Proposed law in Europe ==
The European Parliament passed legislation in 2015; negotiations are currently underway among member states as to specific wording details.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/news-room/20150513IPR55318/Conflict-minerals-MEPs-ask-for-mandatory-certification-of-EU-importers |title=Conflict minerals: MEPs ask for mandatory certification of EU importers |date=May 20, 2015 |accessdate=May 2, 2016 |author=European Parliament}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 June 2016 the European Parliament confirmed that "mandatory due diligence" would be required for "all but the smallest EU firms importing tin, tungsten, tantalum, gold and their ores".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/news-room/20160615IPR32320/Conflict-minerals-MEPs-secure-mandatory-due-diligence-for-importers Conflict minerals: MEPs secure mandatory due diligence for importers], Press Release issued 16 June 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 17, 2017 the EU passed Regulation (EU) 2017/821 of the Parliament and of the Council on the supply chain due diligence obligations for importers of tin, tantalum, tungsten, their ores, and gold from conflict-affected and high risk areas. The regulation will take effect in January 2021, and will directly apply to companies that import 3TG metals into the EU, no matter where they originate.&lt;ref&gt;https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/LSU/?uri=CELEX:32017R0821&amp;qid=1542740800246 Content is copied from this source, which is (c) European Union, 1995-2018.

== Conflict resources in supply chains ==
Increases in business process outsourcing to globally dispersed production facilities means that social problems and human rights violations are no longer only an organization matter, but also often occur in companies’ supply chains, and challenge for supply chain managers.&lt;ref name="SCDD"&gt;Hannes Hofmann, Martin C. Schleper, Constantin Blome: ''Conflict Minerals and Supply Chain Due Diligence: An Exploratory Study of Multitier Supply Chains.'' In: ''Journal of Business Ethics.'' DOI 10.1007/s10551-015-2963-z&lt;/ref&gt; Besides the harm conflict minerals do where they are produced, human rights violations also raise an enormous risk to corporate reputations. Consumers, mass media and employees expect companies to behave responsibly and have become intolerant of those who don't.

Consequently, firms that are located downstream in the supply chain and that are more visible to stakeholders are particularly threatened by social supply chain problems. The recent debate concerning conflict minerals illustrates the importance of social and human rights issues in supply chain management practice as well as the emerging need to react to social conflicts. Conflict minerals are processed in many different components throughout various industries and hence have a high overall impact on business.
 
Initiatives like the [[Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act]] or the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict-Affected and High-Risk Areas&lt;ref name ="OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict-Affected and High-Risk Areas"&gt;[http://www.oecd.org/daf/inv/mne/GuidanceEdition2.pdf OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict-Affected and High-Risk Areas]&lt;/ref&gt; demand that supply chain managers verify purchased goods as ‘‘conflict-free’’ or implement measures to better manage any inability to do so.

Minerals mined in Eastern Congo pass through the hands of numerous middlemen as they are shipped out of Congo, through neighboring countries such as [[Rwanda]] or [[Burundi]], to East Asian processing plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=DR-CONGO: Firms Fuelling 'Conflict Minerals' Violence, Report Says |first=Marina |last=Litvinsky |url=http://www.ips.org/africa/2009/07/dr-congo-firms-fuelling-conflict-minerals-violence-report-says/ |agency=[[Inter Press Service]] |date=July 21, 2009 |accessdate=December 16, 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5v1CoG37B?url=http://www.ips.org/africa/2009/07/dr-congo-firms-fuelling-conflict-minerals-violence-report-says/ |archivedate=December 16, 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Because of this, the US Conflict Minerals Law applies to materials originating (or claimed to originate) from the DRC as well as the nine adjoining countries: [[Angola]], [[Burundi]], [[Central African Republic]], [[Congo Republic]], [[Rwanda]], [[South Sudan]], [[Zimbabwe]], [[Uganda]], and [[Zambia]].

Firms have begun to apply governance mechanisms to avoid adverse effects of conflict mineral sourcing. However, the mere transfer of responsibilities upstream in the supply chain apparently will not stop the trade with conflict minerals, notably due to two reasons: 
*On the one hand, globalization has created governance gaps in a sense that companies are able to abuse human rights without being sanctioned by independent third parties. This gap results in a non-allocation of responsibility that makes the problem of human rights abuses and social conflicts within dispersed supply chains very likely to endure, particularly without collaborative approaches to remedy these deficiencies. 
*On the other hand, conflict minerals usually originate from globally diverse deposits and are difficult to track within components and manufactured products. This is the case because they are mixed with minerals of different origin and added to metal alloys.&lt;ref name="SCDD" /&gt; Consequently, although the share of these minerals in single end products may be negligible, they are prevalent in numerous products and commodities. Together, these circumstances leave downstream firms nearly incapable of detecting risks associated with conflict minerals. Hence, the topic of conflict minerals becomes one of supply chain management rather than of individual companies’ legal or compliance divisions alone. What is needed is effective and supply-chain wide-mechanisms of traceability and due diligence that allow firms to take individual and collective responsibility as parts of supply chains.&lt;ref name="SCDD" /&gt;

In the context of mineral supply chains, due diligence represents a holistic concept that aims at providing a chain of custody tracking from mine to export at country level, regional tracking of mineral flows through the creation of a database on their purchases, independent audits on all actors in the supply chain, and a monitoring of the whole mineral chain by a mineral chain auditor. In this sense, due diligence transcends conventional risk management approaches that usually focus on the prevention of direct impacts on the core business activities of companies. Moreover, due diligence focuses on a maximum of transparency as an end itself while risk management is always directed towards the end of averting direct damages. However, besides the [[Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act]] and the OECD Guidance, there is still a gap in due diligence practices as international norms are just emerging. Studies found that the motivation for supply chain due diligence as well as expected outcomes of these processes vary among firms.&lt;ref name="SCDD" /&gt; Furthermore, different barriers, drivers, and implementation patterns of supply chain due diligence have been identified in scholarly research.&lt;ref name="SCDD" /&gt;

Moreover, [[FairPhone]] Foundation raises awareness of conflict minerals in the mobile industry and is a company which tries to produce a smart phone with 'fair' conditions along the supply chain. Various industry and trade associations are also monitoring developments in conflict minerals laws and traceability frameworks.  Some of these represent electronics, retailers, jewelry, mining, electronics components, and general manufacturing sectors.  One organization – ITRI (a UK-based international non-profit organization  representing the tin industry and sponsored/supported by its members, principally miners and smelters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itri.co.uk/bfora/systems/xmlviewer/default.asp?arg=DS_ITRI_ABOUTART_16/_firsttitle.xsl/4 |title=Tin Markets, Technology and Sustainability |publisher=ITRI |date= |accessdate=2014-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;) had spearheaded efforts for the development and implementation of a "bag and tag" scheme at the mine as a key element of credible traceability.&lt;ref&gt;An overview and timeline of ITRI's activities on conflict minerals can be seen here – {{cite web |url=http://www.itri.co.uk/POOLED/ARTICLES/BF_PARTART/VIEW.ASP?Q=BF_PARTART_310250 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-04-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101206154403/http://www.itri.co.uk/POOLED/ARTICLES/BF_PARTART/VIEW.ASP?Q=BF_PARTART_310250 |archivedate=2010-12-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The program and related efforts were initially not likely to extend beyond the pilot phase due to a variety of implementation and funding problems that occurred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itri.co.uk/pooled/articles/BF_NEWSART/view.asp?Q=BF_NEWSART_322557 |title=Tin Markets, Technology and Sustainability |publisher=ITRI |date= |accessdate=2014-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the end however, the device did enter the market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fairphone.com/#roadmap|title=Fairphone|author=|date=|website=Fairphone}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late March 2011, the UK government launched an informational section on its Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office website dedicated to conflict minerals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Foreign Office launches conflict minerals information for businesses |url=http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/news/latest-news/?view=News&amp;id=575312582 |date=March 29, 2011 |accessdate=April 25, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120929120441/http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/news/latest-news/?view=News&amp;id=575312582 |archivedate=September 29, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This information resource is intended to assist British companies in understanding the issues and, specifically, the US requirements.

== Commercial reporting solutions ==

Manufacturers and supply chain partners needing to comply with the ever-increasing reporting regulations have a few commercial options available.

A major research report from November 2012 by the Southern Africa Resource Watch revealed that gold miners in the east of the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]] were being exploited by corrupt government officials, bureaucrats and security personnel, who all demand illegal tax, fees and levies from the miners without delivering any services in return. Despite the alleged gold rush in regions of the country, none of the population and workforce is benefiting from this highly lucrative industry.&lt;ref name="ALL" /&gt;

When two particles interact, their mutual '''cross section''' is the area [[transversality (mathematics)|transverse]] to their relative motion within which they must meet in order to [[scattering|scatter]] from each other. If the particles are hard [[Elasticity (physics)|inelastic]] [[spheres]] that interact only upon contact, their scattering cross section is related to their geometric size. If the particles interact through some action-at-a-distance force, such as [[electromagnetism]] or [[gravity]], their scattering cross section is generally larger than their geometric size. When a cross section is specified as a function of some final-state variable, such as particle angle or energy, it is called a '''differential cross section'''. When a cross section is integrated over all scattering angles (and possibly other variables), it is called a '''total cross section'''. Cross sections are typically denoted {{math|''σ''}} ([[sigma]]) and measured in units of area.

Scattering cross sections may be defined in [[nuclear physics|nuclear]], [[atomic physics|atomic]], and [[particle physics]] for collisions of accelerated beams of one type of particle with targets (either stationary or moving) of a second type of particle. The probability for any given reaction to occur is in proportion to its cross section. Thus, specifying the cross section for a given reaction is a proxy for stating the probability that a given scattering process will occur.

The measured [[reaction rate]] of a given process depends strongly on experimental variables such as the density of the target material, the intensity of the beam, the detection efficiency of the apparatus, or the angle setting of the detection apparatus. However, these quantities can be factored away, allowing measurement of the underlying two-particle collisional cross section.

Differential and total scattering cross sections are among the most important measurable quantities in [[nuclear physics|nuclear]], [[atomic physics|atomic]], and [[particle physics]].

== Collision among gas particles ==
[[File:CrossSectionFig1.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|'''Figure 1.''' In a gas of particles of individual diameter {{math|2''r''}}, the cross section {{math|''σ''}}, for collisions is related to the particle number density {{math|''n''}}, and mean free path between collisions {{math|''λ''}}.]]

In a [[gas]] of finite-sized particles there are collisions among particles that depend on their cross-sectional size. The average distance that a particle travels between collisions depends on the density of gas particles. These quantities are related by

: &lt;math&gt;\sigma = \frac{1}{n \lambda},&lt;/math&gt;

where
: {{math|''σ''}} is the cross section of a two-particle collision ([[SI]] units: m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;),
: {{math|''λ''}} is the [[mean free path]] between collisions (SI units: m),
: {{math|''n''}} is the [[number density]] of the target particles (SI units: m&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;).

If the particles in the gas can be treated as hard spheres of radius {{math|''r''}} that interact by direct contact, as illustrated in Figure 1, then the effective cross section for the collision of a pair is

: &lt;math&gt;\sigma = \pi \left(2r\right)^2&lt;/math&gt;

If the particles in the gas interact by a force with a larger range than their physical size, then the cross section is a larger effective area that may depend on a variety of variables such as the energy of the particles.

Cross sections can be computed for atomic collisions but also are used in the subatomic realm. For example, in [[nuclear physics]] a "gas" of low-energy [[neutrons]] collides with nuclei in a reactor or other nuclear device, with a [[Neutron cross section|cross section that is energy-dependent]] and hence also with well-defined [[mean free path]] between collisions.

== Attenuation of a beam of particles ==

If a beam of particles enters a thin layer of material of thickness {{math|d''z''}}, the flux {{math|''Φ''}} of the beam will decrease by {{math|d''Φ''}} according to

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\mathrm d \Phi}{\mathrm d z} = -n \sigma \Phi,&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''σ''}} is the total cross section of ''all'' events, including [[scattering]], [[absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]], or transformation to another species. The number density of scattering centers is designated by {{math|''n''}}. Solving this equation exhibits the exponential attenuation of the beam intensity:

:&lt;math&gt;\Phi = \Phi_0 e^{-n \sigma z},&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''Φ''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the initial flux, and {{math|''z''}} is the total thickness of the material. For light, this is called the [[Beer–Lambert law]].

== Differential cross section ==

Consider a [[classical mechanics|classical]] measurement where a single particle is scattered off a single stationary target particle. Conventionally, a [[Spherical coordinate system]] is used, with the target placed at the origin and the {{math|''z''}} axis of this coordinate system aligned with the incident beam. The angle {{math|''θ''}} is the '''scattering angle''', measured between the incident beam and the scattered beam, and the {{math|''φ''}} is the [[azimuthal angle]].

:[[Image:Differential cross section.svg|none|600px]]

The [[impact parameter]] {{math|''b''}} is the perpendicular offset of the trajectory of the incoming particle, and the outgoing particle emerges at an angle {{math|''θ''}}. For a given interaction ([[Coulomb's law|Coulombic]], [[magnetism|magnetic]], [[gravitation]]al, contact, etc.), the impact parameter and the scattering angle have a definite one-to-one functional dependence on each other. Generally the impact parameter can neither be controlled nor measured from event to event and is assumed to take all possible values when averaging over many scattering events. The differential size of the cross section is the area element in the plane of the impact parameter, i.e. {{math|d''σ'' {{=}} ''b'' d''φ'' d''b''}}. The differential angular range of the scattered particle at angle {{math|''θ''}} is the solid angle element {{math|d''Ω'' {{=}} sin ''θ'' d''θ'' d''φ''}}. The differential cross section is the quotient of these quantities, {{math|{{sfrac|d''σ''|d''Ω''}}}}.

It is a function of the scattering angle (and therefore also the impact parameter), plus other observables such as the momentum of the incoming particle. The differential cross section is always taken to be positive, even though larger impact parameters generally produce less deflection. In cylindrically symmetric situations (about the beam axis), the [[azimuthal angle]] {{math|''φ''}} is not changed by the scattering process, and the differential cross section can be written as

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\mathrm{d} \sigma}{\mathrm{d}(\cos \theta)} = \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_0^{2\pi} \frac{\mathrm{d} \sigma}{\mathrm{d} \Omega} \,\mathrm{d}\varphi &lt;/math&gt;.

In situations where the scattering process is not azimuthally symmetric, such as when the beam or target particles possess magnetic moments oriented perpendicular to the beam axis, the differential cross section must also be expressed as a function of the azimuthal angle.

For scattering of particles of incident flux {{math|''F''&lt;sub&gt;inc&lt;/sub&gt;}} off a stationary target consisting of many particles, the differential cross section {{math|{{sfrac|d''σ''|d''Ω''}}}} at an angle {{math|(''θ'',''φ'')}} is related to the flux of scattered particle detection {{math|''F''&lt;sub&gt;out&lt;/sub&gt;(''θ'',''φ'')}} in particles per unit time by

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{\mathrm d \sigma}{\mathrm d \Omega}(\theta,\varphi) = \frac{1}{n t \Delta\Omega} \frac{F_\text{out}(\theta,\varphi)}{F_\text{inc}}.&lt;/math&gt;

Here {{math|Δ''Ω''}} is the finite angular size of the detector (SI unit: [[steradian|sr]]), {{math|''n''}} is the [[number density]] of the target particles (SI units: m&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;), and {{math|''t''}} is the thickness of the stationary target (SI units: m). This formula assumes that the target is thin enough that each beam particle will interact with at most one target particle.

The total cross section {{math|''σ''}} may be recovered by integrating the differential cross section {{math|{{sfrac|d''σ''|d''Ω''}}}} over the full [[solid angle]] ({{math|4π}} steradians):

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma = \oint_{4\pi} \frac{\mathrm d \sigma}{\mathrm d \Omega} \, \mathrm d \Omega = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^\pi \frac{\mathrm d \sigma}{\mathrm d \Omega} \sin \theta \, \mathrm d \theta \, \mathrm d \varphi.&lt;/math&gt;

It is common to omit the “differential” [[qualifier]] when the type of cross section can be inferred from context. In this case, {{math|''σ''}} may be referred to as the ''integral cross section'' or ''total cross section''. The latter term may be confusing in contexts where multiple events are involved, since “total” can also refer to the sum of cross sections over all events.

The differential cross section is extremely useful quantity in many fields of physics, as measuring it can reveal a great amount of information about the internal structure of the target particles. For example, the differential cross section of [[Rutherford scattering]] provided strong evidence for the existence of the atomic nucleus.

Instead of the solid angle, the [[momentum transfer]] may be used as the independent variable of differential cross sections.

Differential cross sections in inelastic scattering contain [[Resonance (particle physics)|resonance peaks]] that indicate the creation of metastable states and contain information about their energy and lifetime.

== Quantum scattering ==

In the [[stationary state|time-independent]] formalism of [[quantum mechanics|quantum]] scattering, the initial [[wave function]] (before scattering) is taken to be a plane wave with definite [[momentum]] {{math|''k''}}:

: &lt;math&gt;\phi_-(\mathbf r) \;\stackrel{r \to \infty}{\longrightarrow}\; e^{i k z},&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''z''}} and {{math|''r''}} are the ''relative'' coordinates between the projectile and the target. The arrow indicates that this only describes the ''asymptotic behavior'' of the wave function when the projectile and target are too far apart for the interaction to have any effect.

After the scattering takes place, it is expected that the wave function takes on the following asymptotic form:

:&lt;math&gt;\phi_+(\mathbf r) \;\stackrel{r \to \infty}{\longrightarrow}\; f(\theta,\phi) \frac{e^{i k r}}{r},&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''f''}} is some function of the angular coordinates known as the [[scattering amplitude]]. This general form is valid for any short-ranged, energy-conserving interaction. It is not true for long-ranged interactions, so there are additional complications when dealing with electromagnetic interactions.

The full wave function of the system behaves asymptotically as the sum

:&lt;math&gt;\phi(\mathbf r) \;\stackrel{r \to \infty}{\longrightarrow}\; \phi_-(\mathbf r) + \phi_+(\mathbf r).&lt;/math&gt;

The differential cross section is related to the scattering amplitude:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\mathrm d \sigma}{\mathrm d \Omega}(\theta, \phi) = \bigl|f(\theta, \phi)\bigr|^2.&lt;/math&gt;

This has the simple interpretation as the probability density for finding the scattered projectile at a given angle.

A cross section is therefore a measure of the effective surface area seen by the impinging particles, and as such is expressed in units of area. The cross section of two [[elementary particle|particles]] (i.e. observed when the two particles are [[collision|colliding]] with each other) is a measure of the interaction event between the two particles. The cross section is proportional to the probability that an interaction will occur; for example in a simple scattering experiment the number of particles scattered per unit of time (current of scattered particles {{math|''I''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;}}) depends only on the number of incident particles per unit of time (current of incident particles {{math|''I''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}}), the characteristics of target (for example the number of particles per unit of surface {{math|''N''}}), and the type of interaction. For {{math|''Nσ'' ≪ 1}} we have

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
I_\text{r} &amp;= I_\text{i}N\sigma, \\
\sigma &amp;= \frac{I_\text{r}}{I_\text{i}} \frac{1}{N} \\
&amp;= \text{probability of interaction} \times \frac{1}{N}.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Relation to the S-matrix ===

If the [[reduced mass]]es and [[momentum|momenta]] of the colliding system are {{math|''m&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}}, {{math|'''p'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''m&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;''}}, {{math|'''p'''&lt;sub&gt;''f''&lt;/sub&gt;}} before and after the collision respectively, the differential cross section is given by{{clarify|reason=This section is an uncontextualized leap. We have jumped, without announcement, from the Schrödinger PDE for a wave in a potential to the language of QFT for two particles colliding.|date=September 2016}}
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\mathrm d\sigma}{\mathrm d\Omega} = \left(2\pi\right)^4 m_i m_f \frac{p_f}{p_i} \bigl|T_{fi}\bigr|^2,&lt;/math&gt;

where the on-shell {{math|''T''}} matrix is defined by
:&lt;math&gt;S_{fi} = \delta_{fi} - 2\pi i \delta\left(E_f - E_i\right) \delta\left(\mathbf{p}_i - \mathbf{p}_f\right) T_{fi}&lt;/math&gt;

in terms of the [[S-matrix]]. Here {{math|''δ''}} is the [[Dirac delta function]]. The computation of the S-matrix is the main goal of the [[scattering theory]].

== Units ==

Although the [[SI unit]] of total cross sections is [[square meter|m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;]], smaller units are usually used in practice.

In nuclear and particle physics, the conventional unit is the barn [[barn (unit)|b]], where 1&amp;nbsp;b = 10&lt;sup&gt;−28&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 100&amp;nbsp;[[femtometre|fm]]&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{SIbrochure8th|pages=127–28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smaller [[metric prefix|prefixed]] units such as [[milli-|mb]] and [[micro-|μb]] are also widely used. Correspondingly, the differential cross section can be measured in units such as mb/sr.

When the scattered radiation is visible light, it is conventional to measure the path length in [[centimetre]]s. To avoid the need for conversion factors, the scattering cross section is expressed in cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and the number concentration in cm&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;. The measurement of the scattering of visible light is known as [[nephelometry]], and is effective for particles of 2–50&amp;nbsp;[[micrometre|µm]] in diameter: as such, it is widely used in [[meteorology]] and in the measurement of [[atmospheric pollution]].

The scattering of [[X-ray]]s can also be described in terms of scattering cross sections, in which case the square [[ångström]] is a convenient unit: 1&amp;nbsp;Å&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 10&lt;sup&gt;−20&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = {{val|10000|u=[[picometre|pm]]&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} = 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;b.

== Scattering of light ==

For light, as in other settings, the scattering cross section is generally different from the [[cross sectional area|geometrical cross section]] of a particle, and it depends upon the [[wavelength]] of light and the [[permittivity]], shape and size of the particle. The total amount of scattering in a sparse medium is proportional to the product of the scattering cross section and the number of particles present.

In terms of area, the ''total cross section'' ({{mvar|σ}}) is the sum of the cross sections due to [[absorption cross section|absorption]], [[scattering]] and [[luminescence]]{{clarify|reason=Is scattering "removal of light from a beam"? Then this characterization should be stated explicitly. Also, it should be explained that luminescence removes light from the direct beam (if this is true), even though one normally associates luminescence with adding light.|date=September 2016}}. The sum of the absorption and scattering cross sections is sometimes referred to as the extinction cross section.
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma = \sigma_\text{a} + \sigma_\text{s} + \sigma_\text{l}.&lt;/math&gt;
The total cross section is related to the [[absorbance]] of the light intensity through the [[Beer–Lambert law]], which says that absorbance is proportional to particle concentration:
:&lt;math&gt;A_\lambda = C l \sigma,&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|''A&lt;sub&gt;λ&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is the absorbance at a given [[wavelength]] {{math|''λ''}}, {{math|''C''}} is the particle concentration as a number density, and {{math|''l''}} is the [[path length]]. The absorbance of the radiation is the [[logarithm]] ([[Decadic logarithm|decadic]] or, more usually, [[Natural logarithm|natural]]) of the reciprocal of the [[transmittance]] {{mathcal|T}}:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=2. Spectrophotometry|isbn=81-219-2633-5|first=P. K.|last=Bajpai|title=Biological Instrumentation and Biology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=THq-cOPO8RQC&amp;pg=PA14&amp;dq=%22extinction+coefficient%22+transmittance+length+concentration}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;A_\lambda = -\log \mathcal{T}.&lt;/math&gt;

== Scattering of light on extended bodies ==

In the context of scattering light on extended bodies, the scattering cross section, {{math|''σ''&lt;sub&gt;scat&lt;/sub&gt;}}, describes the likelihood of light being [[scattering|scattered]] by a macroscopic particle. In general, the scattering cross section is different from the [[cross sectional area|geometrical cross section]] of a particle, as it depends upon the [[wavelength]] of light and the [[permittivity]] in addition to the shape and size of the particle. The total amount of scattering in a sparse medium is determined by the product of the scattering cross section and the number of particles present. In terms of area, the ''total cross section'' ({{math|''σ''}}) is the sum of the cross sections due to [[absorption cross section|absorption]], [[scattering]] and [[luminescence]]:
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma = \sigma_\text{a} + \sigma_\text{s} + \sigma_\text{l}.&lt;/math&gt;

The total cross section is related to the [[absorbance]] of the light intensity through the [[Beer–Lambert law]], which says that absorbance is proportional to concentration: {{math|''A&lt;sub&gt;λ&lt;/sub&gt;'' {{=}} ''Clσ''}}, where {{math|''A&lt;sub&gt;λ&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is the absorbance at a given [[wavelength]] {{math|''λ''}}, {{math|''C''}} is the concentration as a [[number density]], and {{math|''l''}} is the [[path length]]. The extinction or [[absorbance]] of the radiation is the [[logarithm]] ([[Decadic logarithm|decadic]] or, more usually, [[Natural logarithm|natural]]) of the reciprocal of the [[transmittance]] {{mathcal|T}}:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=2. Spectrophotometry|isbn=81-219-2633-5|first=P. K.|last=Bajpai|title=Biological Instrumentation and Biology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=THq-cOPO8RQC&amp;pg=PA14&amp;dq=%22extinction+coefficient%22+transmittance+length+concentration}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;A_\lambda = - \log \mathcal{T}.&lt;/math&gt;

=== Relation to physical size ===
There is no simple relationship between the scattering cross section and the physical size of the particles, as the scattering cross section depends on the wavelength of radiation used. This can be seen when driving in [[fog]]gy weather: the droplets of water (which form the fog) scatter red light less than they scatter the shorter wavelengths present in white light, and the red rear fog light can be distinguished more clearly than the white headlights of an approaching vehicle. That is to say that the scattering cross section of the water droplets is smaller for red light than for light of shorter wavelengths, even though the physical size of the particles is the same.

=== Meteorological range ===

The scattering cross section is related to the [[visibility|meteorological range]] {{math|''L''&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;}}:

:&lt;math&gt;L_\text{V} = \frac{3.9}{C \sigma_\text{scat}}.&lt;/math&gt;

The quantity {{math|''Cσ''&lt;sub&gt;scat&lt;/sub&gt;}} is sometimes denoted {{math|''b''&lt;sub&gt;scat&lt;/sub&gt;}}, the scattering coefficient per unit length.&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=Scattering cross section, {{math|''σ''&lt;sub&gt;scat&lt;/sub&gt;}}|file=S05490}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==

=== Example 1: elastic collision of two hard spheres ===

The elastic collision of two hard spheres is an instructive example that demonstrates the sense of calling this quantity a cross section. {{math|''R''}} and {{math|''r''}} are respectively the radii of the scattering center and scattered sphere.
The total cross section is

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_\text{tot} = \pi \left(r + R\right)^2.&lt;/math&gt;

So in this case the total scattering cross section is equal to the area of the circle (with radius {{math|''r'' + ''R''}}) within which the center of mass of the incoming sphere has to arrive for it to be deflected, and outside which it passes by the stationary scattering center.

=== Example 2: scattering light from a 2D circular mirror ===

Another example illustrates the details of the calculation of a simple [[light]] scattering model obtained by a reduction of the dimension. For simplicity, we will consider the scattering of a beam of light on a plane treated as a uniform density of parallel rays and within the framework of [[geometrical optics]] from a circle with radius {{math|''r''}} with a perfectly reflecting boundary. Its three-dimensional equivalent is therefore the more difficult problem of a laser or flashlight light scattering from the mirror sphere, for example, from the mechanical bearing ball.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal

|first2=
|bibcode = 2003OptCo.226....1X}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The unit of cross section in one dimension is the unit of length, for example 1&amp;nbsp;m. Let {{math|''α''}} be the angle between the [[ray (optics)|light ray]] and the [[radius]] joining the reflection point of the light ray with the center point of the circle mirror. Then the increase of the length element perpendicular to the light beam is expressed by this angle as
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm dx = r \cos \alpha \,\mathrm d \alpha,&lt;/math&gt;
the reflection angle of this ray with respect to the incoming ray is then {{math|2''α''}}, and the scattering angle is
:&lt;math&gt;\theta = \pi - 2 \alpha.&lt;/math&gt;
The energy or the number of photons reflected from the light beam with the intensity or density of photons {{math|''I''}} on the length {{math|d''x''}} is 
:&lt;math&gt;I \,\mathrm d \sigma = I \,\mathrm dx(x) = I r \cos \alpha \,\mathrm d \alpha = I \frac{r}{2} \sin \left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \,\mathrm d \theta = I \frac{\mathrm d \sigma}{\mathrm d \theta} \,\mathrm d \theta.&lt;/math&gt;
The differential cross section is therefore ({{math|d''Ω'' {{=}} d''θ''}})
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\mathrm d \sigma}{\mathrm d \theta} = \frac{r}{2} \sin \left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right).&lt;/math&gt; 
As it is seen from the behaviour of the [[sine]] function, this quantity has the maximum for the backward scattering ({{math|''θ'' {{=}} π}}; the light is reflected perpendicularly and returns), and the zero minimum for the scattering from the edge of the circle directly forward ({{math|''θ'' {{=}} 0}}). It confirms the intuitive expectations that the mirror circle acts like a diverging [[lens (optics)|lens]], and a thin beam is more diluted the closer it is from the edge defined with respect to the incoming direction. The total cross section can be obtained by summing (integrating) the differential section of the entire range of angles:
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma = \int_0^{2 \pi} \frac{\mathrm d \sigma}{\mathrm d \theta} \,\mathrm d \theta = \int_0^{2 \pi} \frac{r}{2} \sin \left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \,\mathrm d \theta = \left. -r \cos \left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \right|_0^{2 \pi} = 2 r,&lt;/math&gt; 
so it is equal as much as the circular mirror is totally screening the two-dimensional space for the beam of light. In three dimensions for the mirror ball with the radius {{math|''r''}} it is therefore equal {{math|''σ'' {{=}} π''r''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}.

=== Example 3: scattering light from a 3D spherical mirror ===

We can now use the result from the Example 2 to calculate the differential cross section for the light scattering from the perfectly reflecting sphere in three dimensions. Let us denote now the radius of the sphere as {{math|''a''}}. Let us parametrize the plane perpendicular to the incoming light beam by the cylindrical coordinates {{math|''r''}} and {{math|''φ''}}. In any plane of the incoming and the reflected ray we can write now from the previous example:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
r &amp;= a \sin \alpha,\\
\mathrm dr &amp;= a \cos \alpha \,\mathrm d \alpha,
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
while the impact area element is 
:&lt;math&gt; \mathrm d \sigma = \mathrm d r(r) \times r \,\mathrm d \varphi = \frac{a^2}{2} \sin \left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \cos \left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \,\mathrm d \theta \,\mathrm d \varphi.&lt;/math&gt;
Using the relation for the solid angle in the spherical coordinates:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm d\Omega = \sin \theta \,\mathrm d \theta \,\mathrm d \varphi&lt;/math&gt;
and the trigonometric identity
:&lt;math&gt;\sin \theta = 2 \sin \left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \cos \left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right),&lt;/math&gt;
we obtain
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\mathrm d \sigma}{\mathrm d \Omega} = \frac{a^2}{4},&lt;/math&gt; 
while the total cross section as we expected is
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma = \oint_{4 \pi} \frac{\mathrm d \sigma}{\mathrm d \Omega} \,\mathrm d \Omega = \pi a^2.&lt;/math&gt;
As one can see, it also agrees with the result from the Example 1 if the photon is assumed to be a rigid sphere of zero radius.

'''Earl V. Shaffer''' (November 8, 1918 – May 5, 2002), was an American outdoorsman and author known from 1948 as '''The Crazy One''' (and eventually as '''The Original Crazy One''') for attempting what became the first publicized claimed hiking trip in a single season over the entire length of the [[Appalachian Trail]] (AT).&lt;ref name="Emblidge"&gt;{{cite book|last=Emblidge|first=David|title=The Appalachian Trail Reader|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H-EXPYo7s_oC&amp;pg=PA91|year=1996|publisher=Oxford UP|isbn=9780195100907|pages=91–94|chapter=Earl Shaffer}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://americanhistory.si.edu/documentsgallery/exhibitions/appalachian_trail_1.html | title=Smithsonian exhibit on Shaffer's 1948 hike | accessdate=December 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He also worked as a carpenter, a soldier specializing in radar and radio installation, and an antique dealer.

==Biography==
Shaffer was born in rural [[York, Pennsylvania]], which lies approximately twenty miles from the AT, and which he always made his home.  In the late 1930s he hiked with a neighbor and close friend, Walter Winemiller, and they made plans to hike the whole of the AT together, after the [[World War II|war]] that they anticipated the US would eventually enter.

Shaffer enlisted in the [[United States Army|army]] in 1941, was well along in his training at the time of the [[Pearl Harbor attack]], and did arduous and risky service as a forward-area [[radioman]] in the South Pacific into 1945.  His friend Winemiller served in the [[Pacific Ocean theater of World War II|Pacific Theater]] as well, and died in the [[Iwo Jima]] landings.&lt;ref name=Luxenberg/&gt; Shaffer said he did the trail to "walk the war out of my system".&lt;ref name="SchererHopey"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Scherer|first1=Glenn|last2=Hopey|first2=Don|title=Exploring the Appalachian Trail: Hikes in the Mid-Atlantic States: 2nd Edition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8Z1xAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA87|year=2013|publisher=Stackpole|isbn=9780811711296|page=87|chapter=They Called Him Crazy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1948, he began the journey from [[Mount Oglethorpe|Mt. Oglethorpe]], in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] (the trail's southern end at that time). With sparse equipment that would be regarded as grossly inadequate by most of the through-hikers since – he used worn boots, his army rucksack, and no stove or tent&lt;ref&gt;Bowers, Greg (May 27, 2002), "Earl Shaffer: Trailblazer". ''Sports Illustrated''. '''96''' (22):A40&lt;/ref&gt; – he reached [[Mt. Katahdin]] in [[Maine]], in 124 days, averaging 17 miles per day.&lt;ref name=Luxenberg/&gt; Especially after he overcame the skepticism of [[Appalachian Trail Conference]] officials (who initially believed his claim of completing the route was obviously fraudulent), his trip raised public awareness of the Trail.  He privately published his memoir of the experience; his book, ''Walking With Spring'' ({{ISBN|0-917953-84-3}}), reflects the experience of most AT hikers, that the project of making the whole trip in the northward direction (the most common choice), is furthered by a start timed to the weather in the  Georgia mountains, and by continually taking advantage of the northward progress of milder weather.

In 1965 Shaffer hiked in 99 days from Maine to [[Springer Mountain]], which had recently replaced Oglethorpe as the Trail's Georgia end, becoming the first person to claim a complete trip in each direction. 

In 1982, the Appalachian Trail Conference published Shaffer's ''Walking With Spring'' commercially; it is now called "a classic trail diary".&lt;ref name=Luxenberg&gt;{{cite book|last=Luxenberg|first=Larry|title=Walking the Appalachian Trail|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rp6RywISXngC&amp;pg=PA100|accessdate=30 September 2015|year=1994|publisher=Stackpole|isbn=9780811730952|pages=100–104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, he claimed another northward through-hike (at age 79) from May 2 to October 21 (six days past official closing of the state park), in 174 days, for the 50th anniversary of his first one, with David Donaldson (known as "The Spirit of '48").  He later developed his notes from this trip, under the working title "Ode to the Appalachian Trail", into ''The Appalachian Trail: Calling Me Back To The Hills''.

Shaffer was diagnosed with liver cancer, and died of its complications soon after on May 5, 2002. Donaldson, his most recent [[thru-hiking|through-hike]] companion, was at his bedside.

On June 17, 2011, he was inducted into the Appalachian Trail Hall of Fame at the [[Appalachian Trail Museum]] as a charter member.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.atmuseum.org/Hall%20of%20Fame%20charter%20class.htm |title=A.T.

'''Ecosystem-based management''' is an [[environmental management]] approach that recognizes the full array of interactions within an [[ecosystem]], including humans, rather than considering single issues, species, or ecosystem services in isolation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/2269460 |jstor=2269460 |title=The Report of the Ecological Society of America Committee on the Scientific Basis for Ecosystem Management |journal=Ecological Applications |volume=6 |issue=3 |pages=665–691 |last1=Christensen |first1=Norman L. |last2=Bartuska |first2=Ann M. |last3=Brown |first3=James H. |last4=Carpenter |first4=Stephen |last5=d'Antonio |first5=Carla |last6=Francis |first6=Rober |last7=Franklin |first7=Jerry F. |last8=MacMahon |first8=James A. |last9=Noss |first9=Reed F. |last10=Parsons |first10=David J. |last11=Peterson |first11=Charles H. |last12=Turner |first12=Monica G. |last13=Woodmansee |first13=Robert G. |year=1996 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be applied to studies in the terrestrial and marine environments with challenges being attributed to both. In the marine realm, they are highly challenging to quantify due to highly migratory species as well as rapidly changing environmental and anthropogenic factors that can alter the habitat rather quickly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1641/B580110 |title=Marine Ecosystem-based Management in Practice: Scientific and Governance Challenges |journal=Bioscience |volume=58 |pages=53–63 |year=2008 |last1=Ruckelshaus |first1=Mary |last2=Klinger |first2=Terrie |last3=Knowlton |first3=Nancy |last4=Demaster |first4=Douglas P. }}&lt;/ref&gt; To be able to manage fisheries efficiently and effectively it has become increasingly more pertinent to understand not only the biological aspects of the species being studied, but also the environmental variables they are experiencing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |doi=10.1002/9781444316315.ch2 |chapter=Biology and Ecology Considerations for the Fishery Manager |title=A Fishery Manager's Guidebook |pages=19–51 |year=2009 |last1=De Mitcheson |first1=Yvonne Sadovy |isbn=9781444316315 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Population abundance and structure, life history traits, competition with other species, where the stock is in the local food web, tidal fluctuations, salinity patterns and anthropogenic influences are among the variables that must be taken into account to fully understand the implementation of a "ecosystem-based management" approach. Interest in ecosystem-based management in the marine realm has developed more recently, in response to increasing recognition of the declining state of fisheries and [[ocean ecosystem]]s. However, due to a lack of a clear definition and the diversity involved with the environment, the implementation has been lagging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.marpol.2015.01.013 |title=Key principles of marine ecosystem-based management |journal=Marine Policy |volume=57 |pages=53–60 |year=2015 |last1=Long |first1=Rachel D. |last2=Charles |first2=Anthony |last3=Stephenson |first3=Robert L. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Terrestrial ecosystem-based management (often referred to as [[ecosystem management]]) came into its own during the conflicts over endangered species protection (particularly the [[northern spotted owl]]), [[land conservation]], and [[water rights|water]], grazing and [[timber rights]] in the western United States in the 1980s and 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1046/j.1523-1739.1999.98127.x |title=Three Faces of Ecosystem Management |journal=Conservation Biology |volume=13 |issue=4 |pages=713–725 |year=1999 |last1=Yaffee |first1=Steven L. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The systemic origins of ecosystem-based management are rooted in the ecosystem management policy applied to the [[Great Lakes]] of North America in the late 1970s. The legislation created, the "Great Lakes Basin and the [[Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement]] of 1978", was based on the claim that "no park is an island", with the purpose to show how strict protection of the area is not the best method for preservation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0169-2046(97)00096-0 |title=Lessons from experience with ecosystem-based management |journal=Landscape and Urban Planning |volume=40 |pages=31–39 |year=1998 |last1=Slocombe |first1=D.Scott }}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of management system was however an idea that began long before and evolved through the testing and challenging of common ecosystem management practices.

Before its complete synthesis, the management system's historical development can be traced back to the 1930s. During this time, the scientific communities who studied ecology realized that current approaches to the management of national parks did not provide effective protection of the species within. In 1932, The Ecological Society of America's Committee for the Study of Plant and Animal Communities recognized that US national parks needed to protect all the ecosystems contained within the park in order to create an inclusive and fully functioning sanctuary, and be prepared to handle natural fluctuations in its ecology. Also the committee explained the importance for interagency cooperation and improved public education, as well as challenged the idea that proper park management would "improve" nature.&lt;ref name=Grumbine1994&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1046/j.1523-1739.1994.08010027.x |title=What is Ecosystem Management? |journal=Conservation Biology |volume=8 |pages=27–38 |year=1994 |last1=Grumbine |first1=R. Edward }}&lt;/ref&gt; These ideas became the foundation of modern ecosystem-based management.

As the understanding of how to manage ecosystems shifted, new tenets of the management system were produced. Biologists [[George Melendez Wright|George Wright]] and Ben Thompson accounted for the size and boundary limitations of parks and contributed to the re-structuring of how park lines were drawn. They explained how large mammals for example could not be supported within the restricted zones of a national park and in order to protect these animals and their ecosystems a new approach would be needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Wright|first1=G.|last2=Thompson|first2=B.|title=Fauna of the National Parks of the United States|publisher=United States Department of the Interior|date=1935|series=Fauna Series 2}}{{pn|date=October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other scientists followed suit, but none were successful in establishing a well-defined ecosystem-based management approach.

In 1979, the importance of ecosystem-based management resurfaced in ecology from two biologists: [[John and Frank Craighead]]. The Craigheads found that grizzly bears of Yellowstone National Park could not sustain a population if only allowed to live within park boundaries. This reinforced the idea that a broader definition of what defines an ecosystem needed to be created, suggesting that it be based on the biotic requirements of the largest mammal present.{{fact|date=October 2018}}

The idea of ecosystem-based management began to catch on and projects throughout American National Parks reflected the idea of protecting an ecosystem in its entirety and not based on legal or ecological restrictions as previously used. Jim Agee and Darryll Johnson published a book-length report on managing ecosystems in 1988 explaining the theoretical framework management. While they did not fully embrace ecosystem-based management by still calling for "ecologically defined boundaries", they stated the importance of "clearly stated management goals, interagency cooperation, monitoring of management results, and leadership at the national policy levels".&lt;ref name=Grumbine1994/&gt; Most importantly they demanded the recognition of human influence. It was argued that scientists must keep in mind the "complex social context of their work" and always be moving towards "socially desirable conditions".&lt;ref name=Grumbine1994/&gt; This need to understand the social aspects of scientific management is the fundamental step from ecological management to ecosystem-based management.

Although it continues to become recognized, a debate over ecosystem-based management continues. Grumbine (1994) believes, while the approach has evolved, it has not been fully incorporated into management practices because the most effective forms of it have yet to be seen.&lt;ref name=Grumbine1994/&gt; He articulates that the current ecological climate calls for the most holistic approach of ecological management. This is in part due to the rapid decline in biodiversity and because of the constant state of flux in societal and political views of nature. Conflicts over public interest and understanding of the natural world have created social and political climates that require interagency cooperation, which stands as a backbone for ecosystem-based management.{{fact|date=October 2018}}

==Implementation==
Because ecosystem-based management is applied to large, diverse areas encompassing an array of interactions between species, ecosystem components, and humans, it is often perceived as a complex process that is difficult to implement. Slocombe (1998b) also noted that in addition, uncertainty is common and predictions are difficult. However, in light of significant ecosystem degradation, there is a need for a holistic approach that combines environmental knowledge and co-ordination with governing agencies to initiate, sustain and enforce habitat and species protection, and include public education and involvement. As a result, ecosystem-based management will likely be increasingly used in the future as a form of environmental management. Some suggestions for implementing ecosystem-based management and what the process may involve are as follows:

===Goals and objectives===
Defining clear and concise goals for ecosystem-based management is one of the most important steps in effective ecosystem-based management implementation. Goals must move beyond science-based or science-defined objectives to include social, cultural, economic and environmental importance. Of equal importance is to make sure that the community and stake-holders are involved throughout the entire process. Slocombe (1998a) also stated that a single, end-all goal cannot be the solution, but instead a combination of goals and their relationships with each other should be the focus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s002679900121 |title=FORUM: Defining Goals and Criteria for Ecosystem-Based Management |journal=Environmental Management |volume=22 |issue=4 |pages=483–493 |year=1998 |last1=Slocombe |first1=D. Scott }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As discussed by Slocombe (1998a), goals should be broadly applicable, measurable and readily observable, and ideally be collectively supported in order to be achievable. The idea is to provide direction for both thinking and action and should try to minimize managing ecosystems in a static state. Goals should also be flexible enough to incorporate a measure of uncertainty and be able to evolve as conditions and knowledge change. This may involve focusing on specific threatening processes, such as habitat loss or introduced invasive species, occurring within an ecosystem. Overall the goals should be integrative, to include the structure, organization and processes of the management of an area.  Correct ecosystem-based management should be based in goals that are both "substantive", to explain the aims and importance of protecting an area, and "procedural", to explain how substantive goals will be met.

As described by Tallis et al. (2010), some steps of ecosystem-based management may include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.marpol.2009.08.003 |title=The many faces of ecosystem-based management: Making the process work today in real places |journal=Marine Policy |volume=34 |issue=2 |pages=340–348 |year=2010 |last1=Tallis |first1=Heather |last2=Levin |first2=Phillip S. |last3=Ruckelshaus |first3=Mary |last4=Lester |first4=Sarah E. |last5=McLeod |first5=Karen L. |last6=Fluharty |first6=David L. |last7=Halpern |first7=Benjamin S. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Scoping
This step involves the acquisition of data and knowledge from various sources in order to provide a thorough understanding of critical ecosystem components. Sources may include literature, informal sources such as aboriginal residents, [[resource use]]rs, and/or environmental experts. Data may also be gained through statistical analyses, simulation models, or conceptual models.

;Defining indicators
[[Ecological indicators]] are useful for tracking or monitoring an ecosystem's status and can provide feedback on management progress as stressed by Slocombe (1998a). Examples may include the population size of a species or the levels of toxin present in a body of water. Social indicators may also be used such as the number or types of jobs within the environmental sector or the livelihood of specific social groups such as [[indigenous people]]s.

;Setting thresholds
Tallis et al. (2010) suggest setting thresholds for each indicator and setting targets that would represent a desired level of health for the ecosystem. Examples may include species composition within an ecosystem or the state of habitat conditions based on local observations or stakeholder interviews. Thresholds can be used to help guide management, particularly for a species by looking at the [[conservation status]] criteria established by either state or federal agencies and using models such as the [[minimum viable population]] size.

;Risk analysis 
A range of threats and disturbances, both natural and human, often can affect indicators. Risk is defined as the sensitivity of an indicator to an [[ecological disturbance]]. Several models can be used to assess risk such as [[population viability analysis]].

;Monitoring 
Evaluating the effectiveness of the implemented management strategies is very important in determining how management actions are affecting the [[ecosystem]] indicators.
Evaluation: This final step involves monitoring and assessing data to see how well the management strategies chosen are performing relative to the initial objectives stated. The use of simulation models or multi-stakeholder groups can help to assess management.

It is important to note that many of these steps for implementing ecosystem-based management are limited by the governance in place for a region, the data available for assessing ecosystem status and reflecting on the changes occurring, and the time frame in which to operate.

==Challenges==
Because ecosystems differ greatly and express varying degrees of vulnerability, it is difficult to apply a functional framework that can be universally applied. These outlined steps or components of ecosystem-based management can, for the most part, be applied to multiple situations and are only suggestions for improving or guiding the challenges involved with managing complex issues. Because of the greater amount of influences, impacts, and interactions to account for, problems, obstacles and criticism often arise within ecosystem-based management. There is also a need for more data, spatially and temporally to help management make sound decisions for the sustainability of the stock being studied.

The first commonly defined challenge is the need for meaningful and appropriate management units. Slocombe (1998b) noted that these units must be broad and contain value for people in and outside of the protected area. For example, Aberley (1993) suggests the use of "bioregions" as management units, which can allow peoples involvement with that region to come through.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Alberley|first1=D.|title=Boundaries of Home: mapping for local empowerment|publisher=New Society |date=1993|pages=1–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; To define management units as inclusive regions rather that exclusive ecological zones would prevent further limitations created by narrow or restricting political and economic policy created from the units. Slocombe (1998b) suggests that better management units should be flexible and build from existing units and that the biggest challenge is creating truly effect units for managers to compare against.

Another issue is in the creation of administrative bodies. They should operate as the essence of ecosystem-based management, working together towards mutually agreed upon goals. Gaps in administration or research, competing objectives or priorities between management agencies and governments due to overlapping jurisdictions, or obscure goals such as [[sustainability]], ecosystem integrity, or [[biodiversity]] can often result in fragmented or weak management. In addition, Tallis (2010) stated that limited knowledge of ecosystem components and function and time constraints that can often limit objectives to only those that can be addressed in the short-term.

The most challenging issue facing ecosystem-based management is that there exists little knowledge about the system and its effectiveness. Slocombe (1998b) stated that with limited resources available on how to implement the system it is hard to find support for its use.

Slocombe (1998a) said that criticism of ecosystem-based management include its reliance on analogy and comparisons, too broadly applied frameworks, its overlap with or duplication of other methods such as [[ecosystem management]], environmental management, or integrated ecosystem assessment, its vagueness in concepts and application, and its tendency to ignore historical, evolutionary or individual factors that may heavily influence ecosystem functioning.

Tallis (2010) stated that ecosystem-based management is seen as a critical planning and management framework for conserving or restoring ecosystems though it is still not widely implemented. An ecosystem approach addresses many relationships across spatial, biological, and organizational scales and is a goal-driven approach to restoring and sustaining ecosystems and functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0169-2046(97)00093-5 |title=The emergence of ecosystem management as a tool for meeting people's needs and sustaining ecosystems |journal=Landscape and Urban Planning |volume=40 |pages=1–7 |year=1998 |last1=Szaro |first1=Robert C. |last2=Sexton |first2=William T. |last3=Malone |first3=Charles R. |url=https://zenodo.org/record/1259921 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, ecosystem-based management involves community influence as well as planning and management from local, regional and national government bodies and management agencies. All must be in collaboration in order to develop a desired future of ecosystem conditions, particularly where ecosystems have undergone radical degradation and change. Slocombe (1998b) said that to move forward, ecosystem-based management should be approached through [[adaptive management]], allowing flexibility and inclusiveness to deal with constant environmental, societal, and political change.

==Marine systems==
Ecosystem-based management for marine environments moves away from the traditional strategies in which single species and single sectors are managed individually; rather it is an integrated approach which considers all key activities, particularly [[Human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]], that affect [[marine environments]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/1312148 |jstor=1312148 |title=Implementing Ecosystem-Based Management |journal=BioScience |volume=43 |issue=9 |pages=612–622 |last1=Slocombe |first1=D. Scott |year=1993 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1641/B580107 |title=Resilience, Robustness, and Marine Ecosystem-based Management |journal=BioScience |volume=58 |pages=27–32 |year=2008 |last1=Levin |first1=Simon A. |last2=Lubchenco |first2=Jane }}&lt;/ref&gt; The management must take into account the life history of the fish being studied, its association with the surrounding environment, its place in the food web, where it prefers to reside in the water column and how it is affected by human pressures. The objective is to ensure sustainable ecosystems, thus protecting the resources and services they provide for future generations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1890/1540-9295(2005)003[0202:IADCAT]2.0.CO;2 |year=2005 |volume=3 |issue=4 |pages=202–211 |title=Icarus and Daedalus: Conceptual and tactical lessons for marine ecosystem-based management |journal=Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment |last1=Guerry |first1=Anne D. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years there has been increasing recognition of disruption to marine ecosystems resulting from [[climate change]], [[overfishing]], nutrient and chemical [[pollution]] from [[land runoff]], coastal development, [[bycatch]], [[habitat destruction]] and other anthropogenic sources. There are very clear links between human activities and marine ecosystem functioning; this has become an issue of high importance because there are many services provided by marine ecosystems that are declining as a result of these impacts. These services include the provision of food, fuel, mineral resources, pharmaceuticals, as well as opportunities for recreation, [[trade]], [[research]] and [[education]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1890/060093 |title=Confronting the challenges of implementing marine ecosystem-based management |journal=Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment |volume=5 |issue=10 |pages=540–548 |year=2007 |last1=Leslie |first1=Heather M. |last2=McLeod |first2=Karen L. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Guerry (2005) has identified an urgent need to improve the management of these declining ecosystems, particularly in coastal areas, to ensure a sustainable future. Human communities depend on marine ecosystems for important resources, but without holistic management these ecosystems are likely to collapse. It has been suggested that the degradation of marine ecosystems is largely the result of poor governance and that new approaches to management are required.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1073/pnas.0706905105 |pmid=18621698 |pmc=2474521 |title=Navigating the transition to ecosystem-based management of the Great Barrier Reef, Australia |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume=105 |issue=28 |pages=9489–9494 |year=2008 |last1=Olsson |first1=P. |last2=Folke |first2=C. |last3=Hughes |first3=T. P. }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Pew Oceans Commission]] and the [[United States Commission on Ocean Policy]] have indicated the importance of moving from current piecemeal management to a more integrated ecosystem-based approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=America's Living Oceans: Charting a course for sea change |publisher=Pew Oceans Commission |date=2003}}{{pn|date=October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=An ocean blueprint for the 21rst Century: Final Report on the U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy |publisher=USCOP |date=2004}}{{pn|date=October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stock Assessment===
In marine environments, it can be increasingly difficult to determine what part of the population a certain stock comes from. In the case of the [[Southern bluefin tuna]], it is all one taxonomic stock while in the [[Pacific Northwest]], each river has its own stock of [[pacific salmon]] and thus, the clear definition of a particular stock can be quite challenging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1139/f97-230 |title=Contested stock assessment: Two case studies |journal=Canadian Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences |volume=55 |issue=2 |pages=529–537 |year=1998 |last1=Starr |first1=Paul |last2=Annala |first2=John H. |last3=Hilborn |first3=Ray }}&lt;/ref&gt; With knowledge on the specific species life history, stock assessment can be much easier and therefore, knowledge on the animals breeding patterns, juvenile state and [[Morphology (biology)|morphological]] patterns are essential.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.fishres.2016.09.018 |title=Can diagnostic tests help identify model misspecification in integrated stock assessments? |journal=Fisheries Research |volume=192 |pages=28–40 |year=2017 |last1=Carvalho |first1=Felipe |last2=Punt |first2=André E. |last3=Chang |first3=Yi-Jay |last4=Maunder |first4=Mark N. |last5=Piner |first5=Kevin R. }}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Dead salmon in spawning season.jpg|thumb|right|Dead salmon in spawning season]]

===Bottom up or top down===
[[File:Post-dip Pose (5614081381).jpg|thumb|right|Post-dip pose]]
When trying to analyze the specific species, the manager needs to fully understand where the species is in terms of the food web. In the [[North Sea]], the [[puffin]] population crashed and no one was quite sure why.&lt;ref name=pmid26177461&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0131527 |pmid=26177461 |pmc=4503501 |title=Decline in an Atlantic Puffin Population: Evaluation of Magnitude and Mechanisms |journal=PLOS ONE |volume=10 |issue=7 |pages=e0131527 |year=2015 |last1=Miles |first1=Will T. S. |last2=Mavor |first2=Roddy |last3=Riddiford |first3=Nick J. |last4=Harvey |first4=Paul V. |last5=Riddington |first5=Roger |last6=Shaw |first6=Deryk N. |last7=Parnaby |first7=David |last8=Reid |first8=Jane M. }}&lt;/ref&gt; After further analysis, they realized that the decline in [[seabird]] numbers was due to the [[sandeel]] population being severely depleted due to fishing pressures and this is an example of top down.&lt;ref name=pmid26177461/&gt; In Alaska, the [[sea otter]] was hunted mainly for its pelt and was nearly pushed to [[extinction]]. As their numbers dwindled, the [[kelp]] beds were disappearing as well at an alarming rate due to the [[sea urchins]] having no predators and eating all of the kelp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1017/S0376892902000322 |title=Kelp forest ecosystems: Biodiversity, stability, resilience and future |journal=Environmental Conservation |volume=29 |issue=4 |year=2003 |last1=Steneck |first1=Robert S. |last2=Graham |first2=Michael H. |last3=Bourque |first3=Bruce J. |last4=Corbett |first4=Debbie |last5=Erlandson |first5=Jon M. |last6=Estes |first6=James A. |last7=Tegner |first7=Mia J. }}&lt;/ref&gt; As the sea otters were removed, the rest of the ecosystem in the [[food chain]] beneath them were affected, an example of top-down.

===Bycatch===
In the [[Gulf of Mexico]], the [[red snapper]] is one of the most important economical species there is. However, it is a very difficult species to manage due to the [[bycatch]] associated with the shrimping industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.fishres.2015.02.009 |title=Reducing bycatch in the United States Gulf of Mexico shrimp trawl fishery with an emphasis on red snapper bycatch reduction |journal=Fisheries Research |volume=167 |pages=210–215 |year=2015 |last1=Parsons |first1=Glenn R. |last2=Foster |first2=Daniel G. }}&lt;/ref&gt; The juveniles are caught in the smaller mesh size used for the shrimp and thus, a large portion of the red snapper population is subject due to mortality not associated with the red snapper fishery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.fishres.2013.04.002 |title=Modelling the effects of density-dependent mortality in juvenile red snapper caught as bycatch in Gulf of Mexico shrimp fisheries: Implications for management |journal=Fisheries Research |volume=146 |pages=102–120 |year=2013 |last1=Forrest |first1=Robyn E. |last2=McAllister |first2=Murdoch K. |last3=Martell |first3=Steven J.D. |last4=Walters |first4=Carl J. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Key elements===
====Connections====
At its core, ecosystem-based management is about acknowledging [[interdependency]] connections, including the linkages between marine ecosystems and human societies, economies and institutional systems, as well as those among various species within an ecosystem and among ocean places that are linked by the movement of species, materials, and ocean currents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=McLedo|first1=K.|last2=Leslie|first2=H.|title=Ecosystem-based management for the Oceans|publisher=Island Press|date=2009}}{{pn|date=October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of particular importance is how these factors all react and involve each other. In the [[Caribbean]], the [[spiny lobster]] is managed based on a classic population model that for most fishery species works quite well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jtbi.2009.01.033 |title=Lévy processes and stochastic von Bertalanffy models of growth, with application to fish population analysis |journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology |volume=258 |issue=4 |pages=521–529 |year=2009 |last1=Russo |first1=Tommaso |last2=Baldi |first2=Paolo |last3=Parisi |first3=Antonio |last4=Magnifico |first4=Giuseppe |last5=Mariani |first5=Stefano |last6=Cataudella |first6=Stefano }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this species will grow and then halt its growth when it need to molt its shell and thus instead of a continuous growth cycle, it will pause its growth and invest its energy in a new shell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.15517/rbt.v53i3-4.14616 |title=Decadal variability in growth of the Caribbean spiny lobster ''Panulirus argus'' (Decapoda: Paniluridae) in Cuban waters |journal=Revista de Biología Tropical |volume=53 |issue=3–4 |pages=475–86 |year=2014 |last1=De León |first1=María Estela |last2=López Martínez |first2=Juana |last3=Lluch Cota |first3=Daniel |last4=Hernández Vázquez |first4=Sergio |last5=Puga |first5=Rafael }}&lt;/ref&gt; To further complicate matters, it slows this process down as it gets older to invest more energy into reproduction thus further deviating itself from the von Bertalanffy model of growth that was applied to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.fishres.2008.06.008 |title=Estimating growth of the Florida spiny lobster, Panulirus argus, from molt frequency and size increment data derived from tag and recapture experiments |journal=Fisheries Research |volume=93 |issue=3 |pages=332–337 |year=2008 |last1=Ehrhardt |first1=Nelson M. }}&lt;/ref&gt; The more information we can gather about an ecosystem and all of the interconnected factors which affect it, the more capable we will be of better managing that system.

====Cumulative impacts====
Ecosystem-based management focuses on how individual actions affect the [[ecosystem services]] that flow from coupled [[socio-ecological system]]s in an integrated fashion, rather than considering these impacts in a piecemeal manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=McLeod |first1=Karen L. |first2=Jane |last2=Lubchenco |first3=Stephen R. |last3=Palumbi |first4=Andrew A. |last4=Rosenberg |year=2005 |title=Scientific Consensus Statement on Marine Ecosystem-Based Management |type=Signed by 221 academic scientists and policy experts with relevant expertise |publisher=Communication Partnership for Science and the Sea |url=https://www.compassscicomm.org/ebm-consensus-statement-download }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Biodiversity loss|Loss of biodiversity]] in marine ecosystems is an example of how cumulative effects from different sectors can impact on an ecosystem in a compounding way. Overfishing, coastal development, filling and [[dredging]], mining and other human activities all contribute to the loss of biodiversity and therefore degradation of the ecosystem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1890/1540-9295(2008)6[43:IANMNF]2.0.CO;2 |year=2008 |volume=6 |pages=43–48 |title=Is a new mandate needed for marine ecosystem-based management? |journal=Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment |last1=Leslie |first1=Heather |last2=Rosenberg |first2=Andrew A. |last3=Eagle |first3=Josh }}&lt;/ref&gt; Work is needed prior to the carrying out of the research to understand the total effects that each species can have on each other and also on the environment. It must be carried out every year as well as species are changing their life history traits and their relationship with the environment as humans are continually modifying the environment.

====Interactions between sectors====
The only way to deal with the cumulative effects of human influences on marine ecosystems is for various contributing sectors to set common goals for the protection or management of ecosystems. While some policies may only affect a single sector, others may affect multiple sectors. A [[policy]] for the protection of endangered marine species, for example, could affect recreational and [[commercial fisheries]], [[mining]], [[shipping]] and [[tourism]] sectors to name a few. More effective ecosystem management would result from the collective adoption of policies by all sectors, rather than each sector creating their own isolated policies. For example, in the [[Gulf of Mexico]] there are oil rigs, recreational fisheries, commercial fisheries and multiple tourist attractions. One of the main fisheries is that of the [[Red Snapper]] which inhabits much of the Gulf and employs thousands of people in the commercial and recreational fishery. During the Deepwater oil spill it became abundantly obvious that it negatively affected the population numbers as well as the integrity of the catch that was being made. The species not only suffered higher mortality rates but the market was less trusting of the product. An environmental disaster interacted with the commercial, recreational, and economic sector for a specific species.

====Changing public perceptions====
Not all members of the public will be properly informed, or be fully aware, of current threats to marine ecosystems and it is therefore important to change [[public perception]]s by informing people about these issues. It is important to consider the interest of the public when making decisions about ocean management and not just those who have a material interest because [[community support]] is needed by management agencies in order to make decisions. The [[Great Barrier Reef]] Marine Park Authority (GBRMPA) faced the issue of poor public awareness in their proposed management strategy which included no-take fishing zones. Olssen (2008) addressed this problem by starting a 'reef under pressure' information campaign to prove to the public that the Great Barrier Reef is under threat from human disturbances, and in doing so were successful in gaining public support.

====Bridging science and policy====
To ensure that all key players are on the same page, it is important to have communication between managers, resource users, scientists, government bodies and other stakeholders. Leslie and McLeod (2007) stated that proper engagement between these groups will enable the development of management initiatives that are realistic and enforceable as well as effective for ecosystem management. If certain small-scale players are not involved or informed, it is highly unlikely and equally challenging to get them to cooperate as well as to follow the rules that need to be put in place. It is of the utmost importance to have every stakeholder involved with every step of the process to increase the cohesion of the process.

====Embracing change====
Coupled social-ecological systems are constantly changing in ways that cannot be fully predicted or controlled. Understanding the resilience of ecosystems, i.e. the extent to which they can maintain structure, function, and identity in the face of disturbance, can enable better prediction of how ecosystems will respond to both natural and anthropogenic perturbations, and to changes in environmental management. With how much modification humans are doing to environments, it is important to understand these changes on a yearly basis as well. Some species are changing their life histories, [[Flounder]], due to the increased pressures that humans are placing on the environment. Thus, when a manager or government does an assessment on the ecosystem for a given year, the relationship that a species has to others can change very quickly and thus negate the model that you use for an ecosystem very quickly if not redefined.

====Multiple objectives====
Ecosystem-based management focuses on the diverse benefits provided by marine systems, rather than on single ecosystem services. Such benefits or services include vibrant commercial and recreational fisheries, biodiversity conservation, renewable energy from wind or waves and coastal protection. The goal is to provide a sustainable fisheries while incorporating the impacts of other aspects on that resource. When managed correctly, an ecosystem-based model can greatly improve not only the resource being managed, but those associated with it.

====Learning and adaptation====
Because of the lack of control and predictability of coupled social-ecological systems, an adaptive management approach is recommended. There can be multiple different factors that must be overcome (fisheries, pollution, borders, multiple agencies, etc.) to create a positive outcome. Managers must be able to react and adapt as to limit the variance associated with the outcome.

==Other examples==

=== Great Bear Rainforest - Canada ===
The Land and Resource Management Planning (LRMP) was implemented by the British Columbia Government (Canada) in the mid-1990s in the [[Great Bear Rainforest]] in order to establish a multiparty land-use planning system.&lt;ref name=Mackinnon2008/&gt; The aim was to "maintain the ecological integrity of terrestrial, marine and [[freshwater ecosystem]]s and achieve high levels of human [[well-being]]".&lt;ref name=Mackinnon2008&gt;{{cite book |last1=Mackinnon |first1=Andy |year=2008 |chapter=Ecosystem-Based management in the Central and North Coast areas of British Colombia |pages=53–6 |editor1-first=Brenda |editor1-last=McAfee |editor2-first=Christian |editor2-last=Malouin |title=Implementing ecosystem-based management approaches in Canada's forests: A science-policy dialogue |chapter-url=https://cfs.nrcan.gc.ca/publications?id=28282 |isbn=978-0-662-48191-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The steps described in the programme included: protect [[old-growth forest]]s, maintain forest structure at the stand level, protect threatened and endangered species and ecosystems, protect [[wetlands]] and apply adaptive management. MacKinnon (2008) highlighted that the main limitation of this program was the social and economic aspects related to the lack of orientation to improve human well-being.

=== The Great Lakes - Canada and United States ===
A Remedial Action Plan (RAP) was created during the [[Great Lakes]] Water Quality Agreement that implemented ecosystem-based management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/09640569811795 |title=Implementing Ecosystem-based Management: Lessons from the Great Lakes |journal=Journal of Environmental Planning and Management |volume=41 |pages=45–75 |year=1998 |last1=Hartig |first1=John H. |last2=Zarull |first2=Michael A. |last3=Heidtke |first3=Thomas M. |last4=Shah |first4=Hemang }}&lt;/ref&gt; The transition, according to the authors, from "a narrow to a broader approach " was not easy because it required the cooperation of both the Canadian and American governments. This meant different cultural, political and regulatory perspectives were involved with regards to the lakes. Hartig et al. (1998) described eight principles required to make the implementation of ecosystem-based management efficacious: "broad-based stakeholder involvement; commitment of top leaders; agreement on information needs and interpretation; action planning within a strategic framework; human resource development; results and indicators to measure progress; systematic review and feedback; and stakeholder satisfaction".

=== Scallop aquaculture in Sechura Bay, Peru ===
Peruvian Bay Scallop is grown in the benthic environment. Intensity of the fishery has caused concern over recent years and there has been a shift to more of an environmental management scheme. They are now using food web models to assess the current situation and to calibrate the stocking levels that are needed. The impacts of the scallops on the ecosystem and on other species are now being taken into account as to limit phytoplankton blooms, overstocking, diseases and [[overconsumption]] in a given year. This study is proposed to help guide both fisherman and managers in their goal of providing long term success for the fishery as well as the ecosystem they are utilizing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2015.09.002 |title=Carrying capacity simulations as a tool for ecosystem-based management of a scallop aquaculture system |journal=Ecological Modelling |volume=331 |pages=44–55 |year=2016 |last1=Kluger |first1=Lotta C. |last2=Taylor |first2=Marc H. |last3=Mendo |first3=Jaime |last4=Tam |first4=Jorge |last5=Wolff |first5=Matthias }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dam removal in the Pacific Northwest===
The Elwha dam removal in Washington state is the largest dam removal project in the United States. Not only was it blocking several species of salmon from reaching their natural habitat, it also had millions of tons of sediment built up behind it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2112/JCOASTRES-D-12-00264.1 |title=Nearshore Drift-Cell Sediment Processes and Ecological Function for Forage Fish: Implications for Ecological Restoration of Impaired Pacific Northwest Marine Ecosystems |journal=Journal of Coastal Research |volume=289 |pages=984–997 |year=2013 |last1=Parks |first1=David |last2=Shaffer |first2=Anne |last3=Barry |first3=Dwight }}&lt;/ref&gt; Once the dam was removed it has drastically altered the environment that was in place. As the environment continues to change over the unforeseeable future, it is imperative to take into account how the species evolve and respond. During the first few years there were no salmon swimming upriver due to the amount of sediment still built up. However, over the past few years there have been more fish swimming upriver to their historic breeding grounds. The sediment not only affected the salmon but also the forage fish outside the river mouth as well as the seagrass beds. Therefore, management of the seagrass beds, which are linked as a nursery for the forage fish is necessary. The forage fish are also prey for the salmon. There are links associated with every aspect of the ecosystem involved with the dam removal on the [[Elwha River]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.17265/2162-5298/2012.05.014 |first1=J.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10022">'''Electric grid security''' refers to the activities that utilities, regulators, and other stakeholders play in securing the national electricity grid. The American electrical grid is going through one of the largest changes in its history, which is the move to smart grid technology. The smart grid allows energy customers and energy providers to more efficiently manage and generate electricity. Similar to other new technologies, the smart grid also introduces new concerns about security.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=McDaniel |first1=Patrick |last2=McLaughlin |first2=Stephen |title=Security and Privacy Challenges in the Smart Grid |journal=IEEE Security &amp; Privacy Magazine |date=May 2009 |volume=7 |issue=3 |pages=75–77 |doi=10.1109/MSP.2009.76}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Utility owners and operators (whether investor-owned, municipal, or cooperative) typically are responsible for implementing system improvements with regards to cybersecurity. Executives in the utilities industry are beginning to recognize the business impact of cybersecurity.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://www.energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2017/01/f34/Electric%20Grid%20Security%20and%20Resilience--Establishing%20a%20Baseline%20for%20Adversarial%20Threats.pdf Electric Grid Security and Resilience: Establishing a Baseline for Adversarial Threats]''. June 2016. ICF International. Page 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Electric grids can be targets of military or terrorist activity. When American military leaders created their first air war plan against the Axis in 1941, Germany's electric grid was at the top of the target list.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/constancedouris/2018/01/16/as-cyber-threats-to-the-electric-grid-rise-utilities-regulators-seek-solutions/#59aa786a343e|title=As Cyber Threats To The Electric Grid Rise, Utilities And Regulators Seek Solutions|last=Douris|first=Constance|date=2018-01-16|work=Forbes|access-date=2018-09-17|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Issue overview ==
The North American electrical power grid is a highly connected system. The ongoing modernization of the grid is generally referred to as the "[[smart grid]]." Reliability and efficiency are two key drivers of the development of the smart grid. Another example is the ability for the electrical system to incorporate renewable energy sources such as wind power and geothermal power. One of the key issues for electric grid security is that these ongoing improvements and modernizations have created more risk to the system. As an example, one risk specifically comes from the integration of digital communications and computer infrastructure with the existing physical infrastructure of the power grid.&lt;ref name="IEEE Security"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Khurana |first1=H. |last2=Hadley |first2=M. |last3=Ning Lu |last4=Frincke |first4=D.A. |title=Smart-grid security issues |journal=IEEE Security &amp; Privacy Magazine |date=January 2010 |volume=8 |issue=1 |pages=81–85 |doi=10.1109/MSP.2010.49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the academic journal ''IEEE Security &amp; Privacy Magazine'', "The smart grid . . . uses intelligent transmission and distribution networks to deliver electricity. This approach aims to improve the electric system's reliability, security, and efficiency through two-way communication of consumption data and dynamic optimization of electric-system operations, maintenance, and planning."&lt;ref name="IEEE Security" /&gt;

== Government oversight ==
In the U.S., the [[Federal Energy Regulatory Commission]] (FERC) is in charge of the cybersecurity standards for the bulk power system. The system includes systems necessary for operating the interconnected grid.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

[[Investor-owned utility|Investor-owned utilities]] operate under a different authority, state public utility commissions. This falls outside of FERC's jurisdiction.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Cybersecurity ==
As of 2018, two evolutions are taking place in the power economic sector. These evolutions could make it harder for utilities to defend from a cyber threat. First, hackers have become more sophisticated in their attempts to disrupt electric grids. "Attacks are more targeted, including spear phishing efforts aimed at individuals, and are shifting from corporate networks to include industrial control systems."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.utilitydive.com/news/cybersecurity-and-the-distributed-grid-a-double-edged-sword/523285/|title=Cybersecurity and the distributed grid: A double-edged sword|last=Walton|first=Robert|date=2018-05-21|work=Utility Dive|access-date=2018-09-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Second, the grid is becoming more and more distributed and connected. The growing "[[Internet of things|Internet of Things]]" world could make it so that every device could be a potential vulnerability.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Terrorist attack risk ==
As of 2006, over 200,000 miles of transmission lines that are 230 kV or higher existed in the United States. The main problem is that it is impossible to secure the whole system from terrorist attacks. The scenario of such a terrorist attack, however, would be minimal because it would only disrupt a small portion of the overall grid. For example, an attack that destroys a regional transmission tower would only have a temporary impact. The modern-day electric grid system is capable of restoring equipment that is damaged by natural disasters such as tornadoes, hurricanes, ice storms, and earthquakes in a generally short period of time. This is due to the resiliency of the national grid to such events. "It would be difficult for even a well-organized large group of terrorists to cause the physical damage of a small- to moderate-scale tornado."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Schainker |first1=R. |last2=Douglas |first2=J. |last3=Kropp |first3=T. |title=Electric utility responses to grid security issues |journal=IEEE Power and Energy Magazine |date=March 2006 |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=30–37 |doi=10.1109/MPAE.2006.1597993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Potential solutions ==
Today the utility industry is advancing cybersecurity with a series of initiatives. They are partnering with federal agencies. The goal is to improve sector-wide resilience to both physical and cyber threats. The industry is also working with [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]], the [[North American Electric Reliability Corporation]], and federal intelligence and law enforcement agencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eei.org/issuesandpolicy/cybersecurity/Pages/default.aspx|title=Cyber &amp; Physical Security|last=|first=|date=|website=Edison Electric Institute|language=en-us|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2018, Brien Sheahan, chairman and CEO of the [[Illinois Commerce Commission]] and a member of the [[United States Department of Energy|U.S. Department of Energy]] (DOE) Nuclear Energy Advisory Committee, and [[Robert Powelson]], a former [[Federal Energy Regulatory Commission]] (FERC) commissioner, wrote in a published piece in ''Utility Dive'' that cyberthreats to the national power system require stronger national standards and more collaboration between levels of government. Recent to their article, the [[United States Department of Homeland Security|U.S. Department of Homeland Security]] confirmed that Russian [[hacker]]s targeted the control room's of American [[Public utility|public utilities]]. The electric distribution system has become more and more networked together and interconnected. Critical public services depend on the system: water delivery, financial institutions, hospitals, and public safety. To prevent disruption to the network, Sheahan and Powelson recommended national standards and collaboration between federal and state energy regulators.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.utilitydive.com/news/cyber-threat-requires-strengthened-standards-for-distribution-utilities-co/531474/|title=Cyberthreats require strengthened standards, increased government collaboration|last=Sheahan|first=Brien J.|date=2018-09-04|work=Utility Dive|access-date=2018-09-13|last2=Powelson|first2=Robert F.|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some utility companies have cybersecurity-specific practices or teams. [[Baltimore Gas and Electric]] conducts regular drills with its employees. It also shares cyber-threat related information with industry and government partners. [[Duke Energy]] put together a corporate incident response team that is devoted to cybersecurity 24 hours a day. The unit works closely with government emergency management and law enforcement.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Some states have cybersecurity procedures and practices:&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

* New Jersey: Utilities are required to put together comprehensive cybersecurity plans.
* Pennsylvania: Utilities must keep physical and cybersecurity, emergency response and business continuity plans. They also have to report severe cyberattacks.
* Texas: The state's public utility commission conducts annual security audits.

'''Energy in Bulgaria''' describes [[World energy resources and consumption|energy]] and [[Electricity generation|electricity]] production, consumption and trade in [[Bulgaria]].

Although [[Bulgaria]] is not very rich in fossil fuels such as [[coal]], [[oil]] and [[gas]], it has very well developed energy sector which is of crucial importance for the [[Balkans]] and the whole [[South Eastern Europe]]. Nuclear power produces 36% of Bulgaria's power. Bulgaria is a major producer and exporter of electricity in the region and plays an important role in the energy balance on the Balkans. The country's strategic geographical location makes it a major hub for transit and distribution of oil and gas from Russia to Western Europe and other Balkan states.

==Energy sector holding==
{{main|Bulgarian Energy Holding EAD}}
To improve the corporate management and supervision of the energy sector, on 13 February 2008 the Government of Bulgaria decided to set up a state-owned energy holding company [[Bulgarian Energy Holding EAD]], a successor of the state-owned 'Neft i Gas' (Oil and Gas) established in 1973. The holding company's business composes of subsidiaries operating in different energy sectors: electricity: [[Kozloduy Nuclear Power Plant|Kozloduy nuclear power plant]], [[Maritsa Iztok Complex|Maritsa East 2 thermal power plant]], [[NEK EAD]] and Elektroenergien sistemen operator (ESO); natural gas: [[Bulgargaz]] and [[Bulgartransgaz]]; coal mining: Mini Maritsa Iztok (Maritsa East mines).  The state holds a 100% stake in the holding company.&lt;ref name=novinite&gt;{{cite news

==Coal mining==
[[File:Transporte por cable de minerales, Devnya, Bulgaria, 2016-05-27, DD 63.jpg|thumb|Mining transport in Devnya, Bulgaria.]]
The country has extensive deposits of coal but these are mostly [[lignite]]. The reserves of lignite coal are estimated to 4.5 billion tons and they are located in the Maritsa Iztok Coal Basin (around 70%), Sofia Coal Basin and Lom coalfield. The reserves of brown coal are 800 million tons with major deposits near [[Pernik]], [[Bobov Dol]] and Cherno More mines. The reserves of [[anthracite]] are slightly more than 1.2 billion tons but more than 95% of these are located in the [[Dobruja]] Coal Basin at depth of some 1.5&amp;nbsp;km and at this stage cannot be exploited. There are several minor oil and gas deposits in Northern Bulgaria.

==Oil and natural gas==
Bulgaria is believed to have extensive [[natural gas]] resources but due to a successful campaign against [[hydraulic fracturing]] does not, as of 2014, permit exploration or exploitation of this possibility.&lt;ref name=FA121912&gt;{{cite news|author1=Aviezer Tucker|title=The New Power Map: World Politics After the Boom in Unconventional Energy|url=http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/138597/aviezer-tucker/the-new-power-map|accessdate=December 31, 2014|work=Foreign Affairs|date=December 19, 2012|quote=The mark of outside influence is clear: In Bulgaria, there are rarely demonstrations of any kind}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT123014&gt;{{cite news|author1=By Jim Yardley and Jo Becker|title=How Putin Forged a Pipeline Deal That Derailed|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/31/world/europe/how-putin-forged-a-pipeline-deal-that-derailed-.html|accessdate=December 31, 2014|work=The New York Times|publisher=The Times Company|date=December 30, 2014|quote=Almost immediately, a well-organized campaign emerged to kill shale exploration before it began, fueled in part by loyalists for Ataka, one of the several far-right parties that Putin has cultivated in Europe.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Power production==
{{main|List of power stations in Bulgaria}}
[[Image:TermoElectricaBulgaria.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Republika TPP near [[Pernik]]]]
The production of electricity was 38.07 billion kWh in 2006.&lt;ref name=Photius&gt;Photius.com, [http://www.photius.com/rankings/economy/electricity_production_2006_0.html Electricity production as of 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; For comparison, [[Romania]], which has a population nearly three times larger than that of Bulgaria, produced 51.7 billion kWh&lt;ref name=Photius/&gt; in the same year. In production per capita, the country is in fourth place in [[Eastern Europe]].

===Nuclear power===
{{see also|Nuclear power in Bulgaria}}
Bulgaria has the [[Kozloduy Nuclear Power Plant]] with six reactors, out of which only two are online (four reactors were taken off-line in 2004 and 2007), with a combined capacity of 3,760&amp;nbsp;MW and covering 36% of country's energy demand.

===Thermal power===
Thermal power plants are also of high importance with most of the capacity concentrated in the [[Maritsa Iztok Complex]]. The largest plants are:

::"Maritsa Iztok 2"   - 1,450&amp;nbsp;MW
::"[[Varna Power Plant|Varna]]" - 1,260 MW
::"Maritsa Iztok 3" - 870 MW
::"[[Bobov Dol Power Plant|Bobov Dol]]" - 630 MW
::"[[Ruse Iztok Power Plant|Ruse Iztok]]" - 600 MW
::"Maritsa Iztok 1" - 500 MW

There is a €1.4 billion project for an additional 670&amp;nbsp;MW for the latter and €900 million for additional 600&amp;nbsp;MW for "Maritsa Iztok 3".

Other minor TPPs are: "Republika" in [[Pernik]] - 180&amp;nbsp;MW, "Sofia"-130&amp;nbsp;MW, "Sofia Iztok"-120&amp;nbsp;MW, "Plovdiv"-60&amp;nbsp;MW, "Pleven"-40&amp;nbsp;MW, "Pernik"-30&amp;nbsp;MW, "Sliven"-30&amp;nbsp;MW and others.

In November 2014 the [[Maritsa Iztok Complex|Maritsa Iztok 2]] [[lignite]]-fired power station was ranked as the industrial facility that is causing the highest damage costs to [[health]] and the [[Environmental degradation|environment]] in Bulgaria and the entire [[European Union]] by the [[European Environment Agency]].&lt;ref name=EEA&gt;{{cite web|title=Industrial facilities causing the highest damage costs to health and the environment|url=http://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/daviz/industrial-facilities-causing-the-highest-damage#tab-daviz-tabular|publisher=European Environment Agency|accessdate=25 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hydropower===
{{main|Hydroelectricity in Bulgaria}}
Due to the limited hydro-potential of the country (excluding the [[Danube]]), the importance of hydro power is not so big. There are currently 87 hydro power plants with a combined capacity of 1,980 MW, most of them being located in the southern and south-western mountainous parts of Bulgaria. The largest hydro cascades are: "Belmeken-Sestrimo"-700 MW, "Dospat-Vacha"-670 MW, "Batashki Vodnosilov Pat"-220 MW. Important HPPs on the [[Arda (Maritsa)|Arda]] river are: "Kardzhali"-106 MW; "Ivailovgrad" -  104 MW and "Studen Kladenets" - 60 MW. There is €65 million project for their modernization.

Three major hydroelectric power plants are under construction: "Gorna Arda" - 160 MW; "Sreden Iskar" – 93&amp;nbsp;MW, €60 million; "Tsankov Kamak" – 90&amp;nbsp;MW, €220 million.

===Wind power===

==Energy transit==
Several major energy transportation routes are to be passed through Bulgaria. The [[Burgas-Alexandroupoli pipeline]] and the [[AMBO pipeline|Burgas-Vlore pipeline]] are oil transportation projects through Bulgaria to bypass Turkish straits in transportation of [[Russia]]n and [[Caspian Sea|Caspian]] oil from the [[Black Sea]] to the [[Mediterranean Sea]].&lt;ref name=transneft&gt;{{cite news

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2230">'''Feather Mountain''' ({{CJKV|t=羽山|s=羽山|p=Yǔshān}}) is one of many important mythological mountains in [[Chinese mythology]], particularly associated with the [[Great Flood (China)|Great Flood]]. According to the mythological studies of Lihui Yang, [[Gun (Chinese)|Gun]] was executed on the "outskirts" of Feather Mountain by [[Zhu Rong (god)|Zhu Rong]], either for stealing the [[xirang]] or for failing to control the flood waters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Yang|first1=Lihui|last2=Turner|first2=Deming An, with Jessica Anderson|title=Handbook of Chinese mythology|date=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-533263-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[K. C. Wu]], [[Emperor Shun]] exiled Gun to Feather Mountain for [[lèse-majesté]], but that Gun was not executed; and, rather, that such accounts result from misunderstanding the meanings associated with the ancient Chinese character ''jí'' (殛), which appears in certain source works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wu|first1=K.

Anthony Christie relays the following three mythic story versions: that on Feather Mountain, Gun was either killed by Zhu Rong, torn into pieces by tortoises and owls, or else that his lifeless-seeming body lay there for three years before being slashed open at the belly with the Wu sword, after which his son Yu emerged as a winged dragon and Gun himself metamorphosed into a yellow bear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Christie|first1=Anthony|title=Chinese mythology|date=1975|publisher=Hamlyn|location=London|isbn=0600006379|pages=87|edition=3rd impression.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5504">[[Image:Ferguson-slide.jpg|thumb|Ferguson Slide]]
The '''Ferguson landslide''', also commonly called the '''Ferguson Slide''', is an active [[landslide]] in the [[Merced River|Merced River canyon]] in the U.S. state of [[California]] which in 2006 blocked a primary access road to [[Yosemite National Park]].  The slide still blocked the original road as of early 2018, although temporary bridges allow one-way traffic around the slide and into the park.  The slide is a natural phenomenon, and resulted from the erosion dynamics of the river valley.{{sfn|DOT|2014}}

The slide began on April 29, 2006, and initially the highway remained open, with active monitoring and occasional temporary closures.  By May 28, the road was closed permanently, stopping access to the park from [[Mariposa, California|Mariposa]] and severely impacting the local economy.  Many park employees reside in Mariposa, and for several months a two-hour trip (one way) was required to get to work in the park.  Revenue via the hospitality market dropped extensively, which included wages, profits to small business owners, and county government income from occupancy taxes.  A [[State of Emergency]] was declared in June 2006 for [[Mariposa County]].{{sfn|DOT|2014}}

[[File:FergusonSlideBridge-2014-01-10.jpg|thumb|The downstream temporary bridge]]
Initially two temporary bridges were built in August 2006.  While this detour alleviated a significant portion of the economic impact to the area, vehicles over 28 feet could not use it.  In June 2008, new temporary bridges which could accommodate longer vehicles were constructed.  The detour via the bridges is one-way, controlled by traffic lights.  At the height of the tourist season, this has sometimes resulted in significant delays.{{sfn|DOT|2014}}

The temporary bridges access a road grade, on the north side of the river, which is a vestige of the [[Yosemite Valley Railroad]].

Repair of the highway was on permanent hold due to the encroachment of an endangered species into the slide area. In 2012, Assemblymember Kristin Olsen authored legislation that would allow the California Department of Fish and Game to do an initial take of the [[Limestone Salamander]] and place it in an Ecological Reserve. The legislation paved the way to restoring this important access route to Yosemite.  Known officially as Assembly Bill No. 1973, it passed both houses of the California State Legislature and was signed into law by [[Jerry Brown|Governor Jerry Brown]] on July 13, 2012.{{sfn|DOT|2014}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201120120AB1973&amp;search_keywords= |title=Bill Text - AB-1973 Protected species: take: Ferguson Slide Permanent Restoration Project |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website= |publisher= |accessdate=June 10, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  After considering the option of a [[tunnel]], [[CalTrans]] settled on a [[rock shed]] design in 2014.{{sfn|Skindrud|2014}}

==Ferguson Rock Shed==

The Ferguson Project located in the Merced River Canyon on Highway 140 into Yosemite National Park will result in the longest structure of its kind in State of California and only the second to be completed in the State.
 
The Ferguson Project Team was formed in 2008 to work toward developing the Ferguson Project that will restore full access through the Merced River Canyon in Mariposa County, California. After completion of all necessary environmental studies, and receiving feedback from local government agencies, the U.S. Forest Service, the U.S. Department of Interior, the public and other stakeholders, the Ferguson Project team completed the environmental document and project report in early 2014. The team recommended that the Rock Shed Alternative move forward in final design. The project construction will be in two distinct construction projects.
 
Phase 1: Will remove the existing talus material and install cable drapery to minimize additional rock fall. Work will begin in spring 2015.
 
Phase 2: Will construct a 750-foot rockshed structure on the same alignment.
 
Throughout the duration of the both phase 1 and phase 2 Highway 140 is expected to stay open – there are no closures scheduled. The project is expected to be completed by summer 2020.{{sfn|DOT|2014}}

'''Hydroxyl tagging velocimetry''' (HTV) is a [[velocimetry]] method used in humid air flows. The
method is often used in high-speed combusting flows because the high velocity and temperature
accentuate its advantages over similar methods.  HTV uses a laser (often an argon-fluoride
[[excimer laser]] operating at ~193&amp;nbsp;nm) to dissociate the water in the flow into H + OH.  Before entering the flow [[optics]] are
used to create a grid of laser beams.  The water in the flow is dissociated only where beams of
sufficient energy pass through the flow, thus creating a grid in the flow where the
concentrations of [[hydroxyl]] (OH) are higher than in the surrounding flow.  Another laser beam (at either ~248&amp;nbsp;nm or ~308&amp;nbsp;nm) in
the form of a sheet is also passed through the flow in the same plane as the grid.  This laser
beam is tuned to a [[wavelength]] that causes the hydroxyl molecules to fluoresce in the [[UV spectrum]].  The [[fluorescence]] is then captured by a [[charge-coupled device]] (CCD) camera.  Using
electronic timing methods the picture of the grid can be captured at nearly the same instant
that the grid is created.

By delaying the pulse of the fluorescence laser and the camera shot an image of the grid that
has now displaced downstream can be captured.  Computer programs are then used to compare the
two images and determine the displacement of the grid.  By dividing the displacement by the known
time delay the two dimensional velocity field (in the plane of the grid) can be determined.

Other [[Molecular tagging velocimetry]] (MTV) methods have used [[ozone]] (O3), excited oxygen and nitric oxide as the tag instead of hydroxyl.  In the case of [[ozone]] the method is known as '''Ozone tagging velocimetry''' or OTV. OTV has been developed and tested in many room air temperature applications with very accurate test results. OTV consists of an initial "write" step, where a 193-nm pulsed [[excimer laser]] creates [[ozone]] grid lines via [[oxygen]] (O2) [[UV]] absorption, and a subsequent "read" step, where a 248-nm [[excimer laser]] photodissociates the formed O3 and fluoresces the vibrationally excited O2 product thus revealing the grid lines' displacement.

[[File:Hypervelocity Impact.png|thumb|Hypervelocity impact]]

'''Hypervelocity''' is very high [[velocity]], approximately over 3,000 [[metre per second|meters per second]] (6,700&amp;nbsp;mph, 11,000&amp;nbsp;km/h, 10,000&amp;nbsp;ft/s, or [[Mach number|Mach]] 8.8). In particular, hypervelocity is velocity so high that the strength of materials upon impact is very small compared to [[inertia]]l stresses.&lt;ref Name="AIAA"&gt;{{cite book

Extreme hypervelocity results in [[vaporize|vaporization]] of the [[impact force|impactor]] and target. For structural metals, hypervelocity is generally considered to be over 2,500&amp;nbsp;m/s (5,600&amp;nbsp;mph, 9,000&amp;nbsp;km/h, 8,200&amp;nbsp;ft/s, or Mach 7.3).  [[Meteorite]] [[impact crater|crater]]s are also examples of hypervelocity impacts.

==Overview==
"Hypervelocity" refers to velocities in the range from a few kilometers per [[second]] to some tens of kilometers per second. This is especially relevant in the field of [[space exploration]] and military use of space, where hypervelocity impacts (e.g. by [[space debris]] or an attacking [[projectile]]) can result in anything from minor component degradation to the complete destruction of a [[spacecraft]] or missile. The impactor, as well as the surface it hits, can undergo temporary [[liquefaction]]. The impact process can generate [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] discharges, which can interfere with spacecraft electronics.

Hypervelocity usually occurs during [[meteor shower]]s and deep space reentries, as carried out during the [[Zond program|Zond]], [[Project Apollo|Apollo]] and [[Luna programme|Luna]] programs. Given the intrinsic unpredictability of the timing and trajectories of meteors, space capsules are prime data gathering opportunities for the study of thermal protection materials at hypervelocity (in this context, hypervelocity is defined as greater than [[escape velocity]]). Given the rarity of such observation opportunities since the 1970s, the [[Genesis (spacecraft)|Genesis]] and [[Stardust (spacecraft)|Stardust]] Sample Return Capsule (SRC) reentries as well as the recent [[Hayabusa]] SRC reentry have spawned observation campaigns, most notably at [[NASA Ames Research Center]].

Hypervelocity [[collision]]s can be studied by examining the results of naturally occurring collisions (between [[micrometeoroid|micrometeorites]] and spacecraft, or between meteorites and planetary bodies), or they may be performed in laboratories. Currently the primary tool for laboratory experiments is a [[light-gas gun]], but some experiments have used [[linear motor]]s to accelerate projectiles to hypervelocity. The properties of metals under hypervelocity have been integrated with weapons, such as [[explosively formed penetrator]]. The vaporization upon impact and liquefaction of surfaces allow metal projectiles formed under hypervelocity forces to penetrate vehicle armor better than conventional bullets.

[[NASA]] studies the effects of simulated orbital debris at the [[White Sands Test Facility]] Remote Hypervelocity Test Laboratory (RHTL).&lt;ref Name="RHTL"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Objects smaller than a softball cannot be detected on radar. This has prompted spacecraft designers to develop shields to protect spacecraft from unavoidable collisions. At RHTL, [[micrometeoroid]] and [[orbital debris]] (MMOD) impacts are simulated on spacecraft components and shields allowing designers to test threats posed by the growing orbital debris environment and evolve shield technology to stay one step ahead. At RHTL, four two-stage light-gas guns propel 0.05&amp;nbsp;mm to 22.2&amp;nbsp;mm diameter projectiles to velocities as fast as 8.5&amp;nbsp;km/s.

==Other definitions of hypervelocity==
According to the [[United States Army]], ''hypervelocity'' can also refer to the [[muzzle velocity]] of a weapon system, with the exact definition dependent upon the weapon in question.  When discussing [[small arms]] a muzzle velocity of 5,000&amp;nbsp;ft/s (1524&amp;nbsp;m/s) or greater is considered hypervelocity, while for [[tank]] [[cannons]] the muzzle velocity must meet or exceed 3,350&amp;nbsp;ft/s (1021.08&amp;nbsp;m/s) to be considered hypervelocity, and the threshold for [[artillery]] cannons is 3,500&amp;nbsp;ft/s (1066.8&amp;nbsp;m/s).&lt;ref Name="DA"&gt;{{cite web

'''La Compagnie des Lampes''' ("The Lamp Company") was the name of several French companies is the area of electrical products.

== La Compagnie des Lampes (1888) ==
[[File:Loupiote radio 1915.jpg|thumb|TM tube]]The original ''Compagnie des Lampes'' was set up at [[Ivry-sur-Seine]] in 1888. The plant was subsequently attached to the CGE (Compagnie Générale d'Electricité) on its acquisition in 1898. The plant is classified as a historical monument.

In 1915, the plant was the second to start manufacturing [[List of vacuum tubes#OETM|''TM'' triode]]s ("'''T'''élégraphie '''M'''ilitaire") in France, under their ''Métal'' brand&lt;sup&gt;([[:ru:TM (триод)|ru]])&lt;/sup&gt; (the first was E.C.&amp;A. Grammont ([[Lyon]]) under their ''Radio Fotos'' brand).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bvws.org.uk/publications/bulletins/pdf/BVWS_Bulletin_25_2.pdf |title=About the French TM valve |first=Fons |last=Van Bergen |publisher=The British Vintage Wireless Society |volume=25 |page=20ff. |year=2000 |accessdate=10 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://archive.org/details/GrandeEtPetiteHistoireDeLaLampeTm |title=Grande et Petite Histoire de la Lampe TM |first=Robert |last=Champeix |publisher=Les Anciens de la Radio et de l'Électronique |language=fr |accessdate=10 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://paillard.claude.free.fr/lampes1.pdf |title=Les lampes |author=Claude Paillard |year=2007 |language=fr |accessdate=31 Mar 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.r-type.org/exhib/abo0009.htm TM tube]; [http://www.r-type.org/exhib/aac0046.htm Horned tube]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.r-type.org/articles/art-020.htm |title= Why the French R valve? |author=Gerald Garratt [[Call signs in the United Kingdom|G5CS]] |accessdate=27 Feb 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tubecollection.de/ura/frankreich.htm |title=Der Anfang |language=de |accessdate=22 Feb 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later they made tubes for domestic AC transformer heating such as the [http://www.mif.pg.gda.pl/homepages/frank/sheets/084/b/BW604.pdf BW604] and [http://www.mif.pg.gda.pl/homepages/frank/sheets/084/b/BW1010.pdf BW1010] under their ''Métal-[[Electric power distribution|Secteur]]'' brand.

== La Compagnie des Lampes (1911) ==
Founded in 1911 by Paul Blavier, ''La Compagnie des Lampes'' was a light bulb factory workshop, located in [[Saint-Pierre-Montlimart]], near [[Cholet]]. The company changed its name in 1918 to become ''Manufacture de lampes à incandescence, la Française''. It was associated with the Thomson group in the 1950s.

== La Compagnie des Lampes (1921) ==
[[File:Zoroastrian fire pot.PNG|thumb|[[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] fire pot - origin of the logo c.1949–59]][[File:Faravahar-Gold.svg|thumb|[[Faravahar]] relating to [[Ahura Mazda]], God of Zoroastrianism - origin of the logo since c.1959]]
In 1921 CFTH ([[Compagnie Française Thomson-Houston]]) and CGE ([[Compagnie Générale d'Electricité]]) jointly created a new ''Compagnie des Lampes''. It later became a major player in the field of lighting in France, notably through its brand [[Mazda (light bulb)|MAZDA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://phozagora.free.fr/?surfpage=Fabricint&amp;fabr=Mazda |title=MAZDA ECLAIRAGE |language=fr |accessdate=31 Mar 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1924 and 1939, it was part of the [[Phoebus cartel]], an oligopoly that dominated the market for light bulbs while putting in place an agreement on the principle of [[planned obsolescence]] for their products.

Besides light bulbs (and like British [[Edison and Swan Electric Light Company|''Ediswan'']]), CdL&amp;nbsp;(1921) also made [[thermionic valve|vacuum tube]]s under the ''Mazda'' brand, for example [http://www.mif.pg.gda.pl/homepages/frank/sheets/148/6/6H8G.pdf 6H8G (1947)], [http://www.mif.pg.gda.pl/homepages/frank/sheets/096/3/3T100A1.pdf 3T100A1 (1949)], [http://www.mif.pg.gda.pl/homepages/frank/sheets/096/e/E1.pdf E1 (1950)]; since 1953 as ''LAMPE MAZDA'': [http://www.mif.pg.gda.pl/homepages/frank/sheets/096/2/2G21.pdf 2G21 (1953)], [http://www.mif.pg.gda.pl/homepages/frank/sheets/096/9/927.pdf 927 (1954)], [http://www.mif.pg.gda.pl/homepages/frank/sheets/148/e/EL183.pdf EL183 (1959)], [http://www.mif.pg.gda.pl/homepages/frank/sheets/148/e/EF816.pdf EF816 (1962)].

Many of their tubes were also available from ''Compagnie Industrielle Française des Tubes Electroniques'' (CIFTE)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radiomuseum.org/dsp_hersteller_detail.cfm?company_id=9235 History of the manufacturer CIFTE, Courbevoie (Hauts-de-Seine, Île-de-France)]&lt;/ref&gt; under their ''Mazda-Belvu''&lt;ref&gt;Example: [http://www.mif.pg.gda.pl/homepages/frank/sheets/020/3/3T100A1G.pdf Mazda-Belvu 3T100A1G datasheet]&lt;/ref&gt; brand (originating from ''Societé Radio Belvu'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radiomuseum.org/dsp_hersteller_detail.cfm?company_id=8166 History of the manufacturer Radio-Belvu, Malakoff (Seine)]&lt;/ref&gt; which sold Grammont's ''Fotos'' tubes).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mif.pg.gda.pl/homepages/frank/other/Belvu/catalogue.pdf |title=Belvu tubes electroniques, Licence R.C.A. |format=PDF |language=fr |access-date=25 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lake Burdur''' ({{lang-tr|Burdur Gölü}}) is a large [[Salt lake|saline lake]] of [[Tectonics|tectonic]] origin, positioned at the frontier between [[Burdur Province|Burdur]] and [[Isparta Province|Isparta]] provinces, in southwestern [[Turkey]]. It is located at around {{coord|37.75|N|30.18|E|type:waterbody_region:TR}}. It has an area of 250&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and maximum depth variously reported at between 50 and 110 m. Water level in the lake fluctuates. Lake Burdur is also an important wetland site for many bird species and is designated a [[Ramsar site]].

Lake Burdur is among the largest and deepest lakes of Turkey, located at the Lake District Region in south-western Anatolia (37°43′351′′ N, 30°10′878′′ E), within a closed basin. Catchment area is 6150&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The average depth is 40 m and maximum depth 68 m. Maximum surface area is 140&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; at 854 m elevation. It is salty and highly alkaline (pH 9.5) and it never freezes.

Lake Burdur is one of the deepest lakes of Turkey. The aquatic plants are not observed in the lake because of the amount of sodium sulphate and chlorine content. Since the lake does not freeze in winter, it serves as a winter refuge for the birds. The ecosystem of the lake is threatened by the presence of an industrial complex  and an airport close to the northern shore. The decrease of water levels (because of construction of upstream dams and unknown causes), increasing of sedimentation (from catchment erosion), organic pollution (from food processing and Burdur City raw sewage waste) and inorganic effluent (from a sulphur mine) represent long-term threats to the integrity of the lake. The water level has decreased from 1975 to 2002 due to construction of dams and ponds in catchment basin, resulting in the loss of 27% of the lake area during the period of 27 years. Nowadays the estimated lake area ranges between 140&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; or 153&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

Lake Burdur has great ornithological importance harbouring numerous wintering bird species. It is the most important wintering site in the world for the [[white-headed duck]], a globally threatened species. It has also served habitats to 10 other internationally important waterfowl species. Lake Burdur has been a Ramsar Site since 1993 and Wildlife Reserve since 1994. ''Aphanius anatoliae sureyanus'' (the only fish species) and ''A. burduricus'' are endemic species of the lake.

The formation of the lake began 5 million years ago as a tectonic depression.(Burdur area is in first grade earthquake zone)
It is known that the lake maintained fresh water character for long period of time.
The altitude in [[Plio-pleistocene]] period was 100 m higher, so the lake extended in NE–SW direction. In late Pleistocene period salinization and shrinking of the lake began, which is a process in progress today. Since 1975 an altitude change of −10 m and 27% volume loss has been recorded. The main reasons for this figures are dams and ponds constructed on main sources of the lake, like Bozcay stream, the severe drought between 1988 and 1995 and especially extensive use of aquifers by local farmers.

'''Lake metabolism''' represents a [[Lake ecosystem|lake ecosystem's]] balance between [[carbon fixation]] ([[Primary production|gross primary production]]) and biological carbon oxidation ([[ecosystem respiration]])&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Winslow|first=Luke A.|last2=Zwart|first2=Jacob A.|last3=Batt|first3=Ryan D.|last4=Dugan|first4=Hilary A.|last5=Woolway|first5=R. Iestyn|last6=Corman|first6=Jessica R.|last7=Hanson|first7=Paul C.|last8=Read|first8=Jordan S.|date=January 2016|title=LakeMetabolizer: an R package for estimating lake metabolism from free-water oxygen using diverse statistical models|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/IW-6.4.883|journal=Inland Waters|language=en|volume=6|issue=4|pages=622–636|doi=10.1080/iw-6.4.883|issn=2044-2041}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Lake metabolism includes the carbon fixation and oxidation from all [[organism]] within the [[lake]], from [[bacteria]] to [[Fish|fishes]]. 

== Concept ==
Estimates of lake metabolism typically rely on the measurement of [[Oxygen saturation|dissolved oxygen]] or [[carbon dioxide]]. Oxygen is produced and carbon dioxide consumed through [[photosynthesis]] and oxygen is consumed and carbon dioxide produced through respiration. 

'''Photosynthesis''': &lt;math&gt;6CO_2+6H_2O\xrightarrow[]{light} C_6H12O_6 + 6O_2 &lt;/math&gt;

'''Respiration''': &lt;math&gt;C_6H12O_6 + 6O_2\xrightarrow[]{} 6CO_2+6H_2O &lt;/math&gt;

Photosynthesis and oxygen production only occurs in the presence of [[Photosynthetically active radiation|light]], while the consumption of oxygen via respiration occurs in both the presence and absence of light. Lake metabolism terms include: 

* GPP - gross photosynthesis 
* R - total respiration
* &lt;math&gt;R_h &lt;/math&gt;- [[Heterotroph|heterotrophic]] respiration 
* &lt;math&gt;R_a &lt;/math&gt;- [[Autotroph|autotrophic]] respiration 
* NEP - net ecosystem production = GPP - R 
* NPP - net primary production = GPP - &lt;math&gt;R_a &lt;/math&gt;

== Measurement techniques ==

=== Free-water dissolved oxygen ===
The free-water dissolved oxygen technique for estimating lake metabolism was first introduced in the 1950's&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=ODUM|first=HOWARD T.|date=April 1956|title=Primary Production in Flowing Waters1|url=https://aslopubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.4319/lo.1956.1.2.0102|journal=Limnology and Oceanography|language=en|volume=1|issue=2|pages=102–117|doi=10.4319/lo.1956.1.2.0102|issn=0024-3590}}&lt;/ref&gt;, but was not widely used until the advancement of automated sensor technology&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cole|first=Jonathan J.|last2=Pace|first2=Michael L.|last3=Carpenter|first3=Stephen R.|last4=Kitchell|first4=James F.|date=December 2000|title=Persistence of net heterotrophy in lakes during nutrient addition and food web manipulations|url=https://aslopubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.4319/lo.2000.45.8.1718|journal=Limnology and Oceanography|language=en|volume=45|issue=8|pages=1718–1730|doi=10.4319/lo.2000.45.8.1718|issn=0024-3590}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2012-02-01|title=Staying afloat in the sensor data deluge|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169534711003326|journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution|language=en|volume=27|issue=2|pages=121–129|doi=10.1016/j.tree.2011.11.009|issn=0169-5347}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Automated sensor technology enables measurement of dissolved oxygen during periods that are hard to measure manually such as during storms. 

=== Free-water carbon dioxide ===
Similar to the free-water dissolved oxygen technique, this method measures diel dissolved gas that is produced and consumed from photosynthesis and respiration. 

=== &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C tracer ===
&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C can be used along with light and dark bottles to estimate depth-specific [[Pelagic zone|pelagic]] metabolism, or whole-lake metabolism when used in conjunction with sediment chambers. There are "container effects" that are a common criticism to using this method&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bender|first=Michael|last2=Grande|first2=Karen|last3=Johnson|first3=Kenneth|last4=Marra|first4=John|last5=Williams|first5=Peter J.

===&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O tracer ===
This method uses spiked H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O and light bottles to measure the amount of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; produced from photosynthesis. 

=== Whole-lake carbon budget ===
Measuring all the inputs and outputs of carbon to and from a lake can be used to estimate net ecosystem production. 

== Metabolism models ==
The free-water measurement techniques require mathematical models to estimate lake metabolism metrics from dissolved gas measurements. These models range in complexity from simple algebraic models to depth-integrated modeling using more advanced statistical techniques.

'''Landscape planning''' is a branch of [[landscape architecture]]. According to Erv Zube (1931–2002) landscape planning is defined as an activity concerned with developing landscaping amongst competing [[land use]]s while protecting natural processes and significant cultural and [[natural resources]]. [[park system|Park systems]] and [[greenway (landscape)|greenways]] of the type designed by [[Frederick Law Olmsted]] are key examples of landscape planning. Landscape designers tend to work for clients who wish to commission construction work. Landscape planners analyze broad issues as well as project characteristics which constrain design projects.

Landscape planners may work on projects which are of broad geographical scope, concern many land uses or many clients or are implemented over a long period of time. As an example, the damage caused by unplanned [[mineral extraction]] was one of the early reasons for a public demand for landscape planning.

==In Asia==
In India, the history of landscape planning can be traced to the [[Vedas]] and to the [[Vaastu Shastra]]s. These ancient texts set forth principles for planning settlements, temples and other structures in relation to the [[natural landscape]]. Relationships with mountains (the home of the gods) and with rivers (regarded as goddesses) were of particular importance. A square form represented the earth and a circular form represented heaven. A [[mandala]] explained the relationship between heaven and earth. Square plans, for both secular and religious structures, were set out with their sides facing north, south, east and west. The earliest surviving stone temple set out in this way is [[Sanchi]].

In China, landscape planning originated with [[Feng Shui]], which is translated into English as 'wind and water' and is used to describe a set of general principles for the planning of development in relation to the [[natural landscape]]. The aim was to find the most auspicious environment possible, one sited in harmony with natural phenomena and the physical and psychological needs of man.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Chinese Architecture|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=2T1mScdj8CYC|publisher = Yale University Press|date = 2002-01-01|isbn = 0300095597|language = en|first = Nancy Shatzman|last = Steinhardt|first2 = Xinian|last2 = Fu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Europe]], the history of landscape planning can be traced to the work of [[Vitruvius]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Vitruvius Ten Books on Architecture, with regard to landscape and garden design|url = http://www.gardenvisit.com/history_theory/garden_landscape_design_articles/landscape_theory/vitruvius|website = www.gardenvisit.com|accessdate = 2015-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In discussing the planning of towns, he wrote about site planning with regard to microclimate, about the planning of streets and about the role of metaphor in design. Vitruvius' theories were revived during the renaissance and came to influence the planning of towns throughout Europe and the Americas. [[Leon Battista Alberti|Alberti]] wrote on the need for town squares for markets and specific implementations to make most use of the space.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Public and Private Spaces of the City|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=thmCAgAAQBAJ|publisher = Routledge|date = 2003-09-02|isbn = 1134519850|language = en|first = Ali|last = Madanipour}}&lt;/ref&gt; In North Europe this developed into the idea that residential squares should planned around green spaces. The first space of this type was the [[Place des Vosges]]. Residential squares were also made in Britain and their planning developed into the idea of incorporating public open space ([[public park]]s within towns). [[Frederick Law Olmsted]] gave momentum to this idea with his proposal for a [[park system]]s in Boston - the famous [[Emerald Necklace]]. [[Patrick Abercrombie]] took up this idea and incorporated it in his great 1943-4 Open Space Plan for the County of London.

==In the US ==
In the United States, landscape architects provide landscape planning services focused on the natural environment along with [[urban planner|urban planners]]. But, unlike Canada and Europe, the US does not have a national [[land use planning]] system. [[Frederick Law Olmsted]] and [[Ian McHarg]] are two influential American landscape architects that also worked as planners. McHarg's work on overlay landscape planning contributed to the development of [[GIS]] and to the foundation of [[Environmental Systems Research Institute|ESRI]] by [[Jack Dangermond]].

==Legislation==
The principles of landscape planning are now incorporated in various types of legislation and policy documents. In America, the [[National Environmental Policy Act]] was influenced by the work of [[Ian McHarg]] on [[Environmental impact assessment]]. In Germany, the Federal Nature Conservation Act requires the preparation of landscape plans. For the Europe Union as a whole, the [[European Landscape Convention]] has wide-ranging implications for the design and planning of relationships between development and the landscape. In Asia, major development projects are taking place and illustrating the need for good landscape planning. The [[Three Gorges Dam]], for example, will have extensive impacts on the landscape. They have been planned to a degree but future monitoring of the project is likely to show that better landscape planning and design would have been possible.

==Theory==
{{Disputed-section|The Broads|date=December 2012}}
Landscape planners are concerned with the 'health' of the landscape, just as doctors are concerned with bodily health. This analogy can be taken further. Medical doctors advise both on the health of individuals and on matters of public health. When individuals take actions injurious to their own health this is regarded as a private matter. But if they take actions injurious to public health, these actions are properly regulated by law. The [[collective landscape]] is a [[public good]] which should be protected and enhanced by legislation and public administration. If, for example, mineral extraction has a damaging impact on the landscape, this is a proper field for intervention. Negative impacts on the landscape could include visual impacts, ecological impacts, hydrological impacts and recreational impacts. As well as protecting existing public goods, societies are responsible for the creation of new public goods. This can be done by positive landscape planning. There are, for example, many former mineral workings (e.g. the [[Norfolk Broads]]) which have become important public goods. Medical doctors are trained in [[anatomy]], [[physiology]], [[biochemistry]] etc. before becoming practitioners. Landscape doctors are trained in [[geomorphology]], [[hydrology]], [[ecology]] etc. before becoming practitioners in design and planning. When qualified, they can specialize in areas of landscape planning:
*[[Landscape of roads]] - The landscape treatment of roads is concerned with the planning and design of [[road]]s and [[highway]]s with regard to their [[environmental impact assessment|environmental impact]] on the surrounding landscape. Sylvia Crowe wrote a pioneering book on the design of roads with regard to their impact on the landscape and Ian McHarg proposed an overlay system for highway route selection in his book on ''Design with nature''. In addition, the role of landscape, natural and ecological features and values especially natural and man-made infrastructure networks is hence quite important when planning strategic and macro policies, given that urban and inter-urban access networks are amongst the most important infrastructures in regional national and international levels. From the landscape point of view, ''general highway landscape frameworks'' must be formulated with respect to environmental needs ecological conditions and visual attractions, and particularly road edges. This can underlie quality-oriented planning and landscape design in many highways in regional and national levels.&lt;ref name=Taghvaei&gt;Taghvaei, S-Hassan "Importance of Highway and Expressway Landscape Design." ''Journal of The Urban Development and Organization: Haft Shahr'', '''4''', No. 55-56. Autumn, 2016. 10–30. [www.haftshahrjournal.ir/article_26567_aedaa43a6bea0c726a9f973112885ee1.pdf. Accessed 10 February 2018]&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Landscape of forestry]] - The '''landscape treatment of forests''' is concerned with the non-timber objectives which can be obtained by conserving and developing forests: scenic quality, water quality, recreation, [[wildlife management|wildlife conservation]] and other [[environmental good]]s. This work is done by foresters who also hold qualifications in [[landscape architecture]] and also by landscape architects and landscape planners with a specialization in forestry. The [[United States Forest Service]], the [[Forestry Commission|UK Forestry Commission]] and other forest agencies are also employers of landscape architects. They have mitigated criticism of [[plantation|plantation forestry]], [[monoculture]], and [[clear-cutting]].
*[[Landscape of energy]] - The generation of energy has become a major land use with consequent [[Environmental Impact Assessment|environmental impacts]] upon the landscape. Landscape planning for energy is concerned with designs and plans to mitigate the impact of power generation upon the landscape. This includes landscape planning for:
** [[power stations]]
** [[Power transmission|power transmission lines]]
** [[hydroelectric power]]
** [[tidal power]]
** [[solar power]]
** [[wind power]]
*[[Landscape of urbanization]] - Most of the world's cities are expanding into agricultural land. Landscape planning for [[urbanization]] is concerned with the conservation and development of landscape resources as urbanization takes place. [[Ian McHarg|Ian McHarg's]] approach to this problem was to prepare a series of overlay maps showing the different types of quality in the land around settlements: agricultural value, property value, hydrological value, scenic value, recreational value, ecological value etc. The maps of value were then overlaid to produce a composite map which looked like an X-Ray photograph - with the dark areas having the most value and the white areas the least value. His belief was that the 'white land' should be urbanized in preference to the 'black land'. The overlay mapping system which McHarg proposed is now carried out using a [[Geographic Information System]]. Other landscape planners have proposed [[Greenway (landscape)|greenways]] and [[green belt]]s as a means of [[Growth management|urban growth management]].
*[[Landscape Urbanism]] is a theory of [[urbanism]] arguing that [[landscape]], rather than [[architecture]], is more capable of organizing the city and enhancing the urban experience.
*[[Landscape of recreation]] - Recreation has become a large-scale landuse. In the coastal regions of many countries (e.g. [[Spain]] and [[Denmark]]) it is the dominant land use and has had an enormous impact on the natural landscape. The landscape of [[recreation]] is concerned with mitigating the [[Environmental Impact Assessment|environmental impact]] of recreation on the landscape. [[Landscape architects]] and landscape planners work on the landscape of recreation to:
** reclaim landscapes which have been damaged by recreational use
** carry out [[Environmental Impact Assessment|environmental impact assessments]] of [[recreation resource planning|recreational development proposals]]
** prepare landscape plans and designs for recreation projects
*[[Landscape of mineral extraction]] - Mineral extraction has a long history of damaging the landscape. Harm has been caused to scenic quality, water quality, habitat quality and other [[environmental good]]s. The landscape treatment of mineral workings is concerned with:
** the [[Land reclamation|reclamation]] of abandoned [[mining|mines]] and [[quarry|quarries]]
** the planning and design of future mineral workings to minimize their harmful [[environmental impact analysis|environmental impact]] and achieve as many positive impacts on the environment as possible.
*[[Landscape of agriculture]] - The primary purpose of agriculture is food production but concern for other objectives (e.g. wildlife, conservation, biodiversity, recreation and scenery) have a long history and are of increasing importance in wealthy and urbanized countries. The European Union Set-Aside Policy was designed as a means of giving money to farmers to produce non-food environmental goods from farmland. Landscape planners are involved with the preparation of agricultural landscape plans for the achievement of non-food objectives from agricultural land.
*[[River reclamation|Landscape of rivers]] - The construction of new buildings and new roads accelerates the discharge of surface water runoff and raises flood peaks in the lower reachers of river catchments. River banks therefore have to be raised and flood channels have to be constructed. The adoption of [[sustainable urban drainage systems]] facilitates the [[Land reclamation|reclamation]] of rivers. When water is detained, infiltrated and transpired near to the where it falls, flood peaks are lowered and rivers can be reclaimed. The high concrete walls in which they were confined can be replaced by vegetated embankments. Water quality is improved and wildlife returns to the river. Projects to achieve these objectives are described as River Reclamation or River Restoration.
[[Image:khajuraho-landscape.jpg|thumb|right|The western group of [[Khajuraho]] temples (2005) set in an archaeologically inappropriate parkland landscape |300px]]
*[[Landscape of archaeology]] - The landscape of archaeology is concerned with the landscape treatment of archaeological sites. This involves analysis, discussion, the formulation of policies and the preparation of landscape designs relating a number of issues. In Britain the former Ministry of Public Works and Buildings (MPBW) (now [[English Heritage]], [[Cadw]], [[Historic Scotland]] and [[Environment and Heritage Service|Northern Ireland Environment and Heritage Service]]) had a policy of treating archaeological sites like highly manicured gardens. The grass was maintained almost to the quality of a bowling green. The standard of care was admirable but there was little or no regard to the former landscape character of the archaeological site. The development of the discipline of [[landscape archaeology]] has awakened interest in this question because the wider landscape is seen, correctly, as having archaeological value. Most historic societies earned their livelihood from working the land. Their buildings were an important accessory to the use of the land. In countries where the looting of archaeological sites is a problem, there is a tendency for them to be surrounded with chain links or other security fencing. This detracts from the relationship between the site and its landscape setting. In other countries, archaeological sites have become important visitor attractions and sources of revenue. This has led to the building of tourist facilities (visitor centres, hotels etc.) which can easily have a detrimental impact on the archaeological site and its landscape setting.

In each case, the aim is to take a specialist land use and make recommendations for what can be done to enhance its implact on the stock of [[environmental good]]s.

==Methodology==
The conventional planning process is a linear progression of activities. The common steps are:

*Identification of problems and opportunities.
*Establishment of goals.
*Inventory and analysis of the biophysical environment.
*Human community inventory and analysis.
*Development of concepts and the selection of options.
*Adoption of a plan.
*Community involvement and education.
*Detailed design.
*Plan implementation.
*Plan administration.

Landscape planning not always means an ecological planning method, for that it must be considered that "planning is a process that uses the scientific and technical information for considering and reaching consensus on a range of choices. Ecology is the study of the relationship of all living things, including people, to their biological and physical environments. Ecological planning then may be defined as the use of biophysical and sociocultural information to suggest opportunities and constraints for decision making about the use of landscape". (Steiner, 1991)

'''Large low-shear-velocity provinces''', '''LLSVPs''', also called '''LLVPs''' or '''superplumes''', are characteristic structures of parts of the lowermost [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]] (the region surrounding the [[outer core]]) of the Earth&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Garnero, McNamara, Shim|first=|date=2016|title=Continent-sized anomalous zones with low seismic velocity at the base of Earth's mantle|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/ngeo2733|journal=Nature Geoscience|volume=9|pages=481–489|via=|bibcode=2016NatGe...9..481G|doi=10.1038/ngeo2733}}&lt;/ref&gt;. These provinces are characterized by slow [[shear wave]] velocities and were discovered by [[seismic tomography]] of the deep Earth. There are two main provinces: the African LLSVP and the Pacific LLSVP. Both extend laterally for thousands of kilometers and possibly up to 1000&amp;nbsp;km vertically from the [[core-mantle boundary]]. The Pacific LLSVP has specific dimensions of 3000&amp;nbsp;km across and 300 m higher than the surrounding ocean-floor, and is situated over four hotspots that suggest multiple mantle plumes underneath.&lt;ref name="MantleD"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Maruyama|last2=Santosh|last3=Zhao|title=Superplume, supercontinent, and post-perovskite: Mantle dynamis and anti-plate tectonics on the Core-Mantle Boundary|journal=Gondwana Research|date=4 June 2006|volume=11|issue=1–2|pages=7–37|accessdate=17 August 2006| url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/M_Santosh/publication/223376499_Superplume_supercontinent_and_post-perovskite_Mantle_dynamics_and_anti-plate_tectonics_on_the_CoreMantle_Boundary/links/02e7e516411ade1119000000.pdf|doi=10.1016/j.gr.2006.06.003|bibcode=2007GondR..11....7M}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These zones represent around 8% of the volume of the mantle (6% of the Earth).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Other names for LLSVPs include ''superwells'', ''thermo-chemical piles'', or ''hidden reservoirs''. Some of these names, however, are more interpretive of their [[Geodynamics|geodynamical]] or [[Geochemistry|geochemical]] effects, while many questions remain about their nature.
==Seismological constraints==
LLSVPs were discovered in full mantle seismic tomographic models of [[shear velocity]] as slow features in the lowermost mantle beneath Africa and the Pacific. The boundaries of these features appear fairly consistent across models when applying objective [[k-means clustering]].&lt;ref name="Lekic2012"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012821X12005109 |title= Cluster analysis of global lower mantle

The sharpness of the boundaries makes it difficult to explain the features by temperature alone; the LLSVPs need to be compositionally distinct to explain the velocity jump.
[[Ultra low velocity zone]]s (ULVZ) at smaller scales have been discovered mainly at the edges of these LLSVPs.&lt;ref name="McNamara2010"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mcnamara.asu.edu/content/publications/pdfs/McNamara_et_al_epsl_2010.pdf |title= Tracking deep mantle reservoirs with ultra-low velocity zones

By using the solid Earth tide, the density of these regions has been determined. The bottom two thirds are 0.5% denser than the bulk of the mantle. However tidal tomography cannot say exactly how the excess mass is distributed. The overdensity may be due to primordial material or subducted ocean slabs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lau|first1=Harriet C. P.|last2=Mitrovica|first2=Jerry X.|last3=Davis|first3=James L.|last4=Tromp|first4=Jeroen|last5=Yang|first5=Hsin-Ying|last6=Al-Attar|first6=David|title=Tidal tomography constrains Earth’s deep-mantle buoyancy|journal=Nature|date=15 November 2017|volume=551|issue=7680|pages=321–326|doi=10.1038/nature24452|bibcode=2017Natur.551..321L}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Possible origin==
The current leading hypothesis for the LLSVPs is the accumulation of subducted oceanic slabs. This corresponds with the locations of known [[Crustal_recycling#Historical_and_theoretical_context|slab graveyards]] surrounding the Pacific LLSVP. These graveyards are thought to be the reason for the high velocity zone anomalies surrounding the Pacific LLSVP and are thought to have formed by subduction zones that were around long before the dispersion—some 750 million years ago—of the supercontinent [[Rodinia]]. Aided by the phase transformation, the temperature would partially melt the slabs, to form a dense heavy melt that pools and forms the [[ultra low velocity zone]] (ULVZ) structures at the bottom of the core-mantle boundary closer to the LLSVP than the slab graveyards. The rest of the material is then carried upwards due to chemical buoyancy and contributes to the high levels of basalt found at the [[mid-ocean ridge]]. The resulting motion forms small clusters of small plumes right above the core-mantle boundary that combine to form larger plumes and then contribute to superplumes. The Pacific and African LLSVP, in this scenario, are originally created by a discharge of heat from the core (4000&amp;nbsp;K) to the much colder mantle (2000&amp;nbsp;K), the recycled lithosphere is only fuel that helps drive the superplume convection. Since it would be difficult for the Earth's core to maintain this high heat by itself, it gives support for the existence of [[radiogenic nuclide]]s in the core, as well as the indication that if fertile subducted lithosphere stops subducting in locations preferable for superplume consumption, it will mark the demise of that superplume.&lt;ref name="MantleD" /&gt;

==Dynamics==
Geodynamic [[mantle convection]] models have included compositional distinctive material. The material tends to get swept up in ridges or piles.&lt;ref name="McNamara2010" /&gt; When including realistic past [[plate tectonics|plate motions]] into the modeling, the material gets swept up in locations that are remarkably similar to the present day location of the LLSVPs.&lt;ref name="Steinberger2012"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.earthdynamics.org/papers-ED/2012/2012-Steinberger-Torsvik-G3.pdf
|title=A geodynamic model of plumes from the margins of Large Low Shear Velocity Provinces
|author=Steinberger, B.
|author2=Torsvik, T.H.
|date=2012
|publisher=G^3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These locations also correspond with known [[Slab (geology)|slab]] graveyard locations mentioned in the origin section. These types of models, as well as the observation that the degree two structure of the LLSVPs is orthogonal to the path of [[true polar wander]], suggest these mantle structures have been stable over large amounts of time. This geometrical relationship is also consistent with the position of the supercontinent [[Pangaea]], and the formation of the current geoid pattern due to continental break-up from the superswell below.&lt;ref name="Dziewonski2010"/&gt;
However, the heat from the core is not enough to sustain the energy needed to fuel the superplume(s) located at the LLSVPs. There is a phase transition from [[perovskite]] to [[post-perovskite]] from the down welling slab(s) that causes an exothermic reaction. This exothermic reaction helps to heat the LLSVP, but it is not sufficient enough to account for the total energy needed to sustain it. So it is hypothesized that the material from the slab graveyard can become extremely dense and form large pools of melt concentrate enriched in [[uranium]], [[thorium]], and [[potassium]]. These concentrated radiogenic elements are thought to provide the high temperatures needed. So, the appearance and disappearance of slab graveyards predicts the birth and death of an LLSVP, potentially changing the dynamics of all plate tectonics.&lt;ref name="MantleD" /&gt;

'''''Life Extension:  A Practical Scientific Approach''''' is a 1982 book ({{ISBN|0-446-51229-X}}) by [[Durk Pearson]] and [[Sandy Shaw (writer)|Sandy Shaw]] that popularized the [[life extension]] and [[Nootropic|smart drug]] movements.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Rapture: How Biotech Became the New Religion'', by Brian S. Alexander, New York: Basic Books, 2003, {{ISBN|0-7382-0761-6}}, pp. 5&amp;ndash;6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Katherine |last=Bishop |publisher=[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]] newspaper|title=FDA fears smart drugs could pose stupid risks |date=1992-06-11 |accessdate=2007-03-01 |url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:AWNB:SPIB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=0EB04A057A2FC5B9&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated4&amp;req_dat=0D0CB57AB53DF815 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The book discussed [[Radical (chemistry)|free radical]]s and the idea that they cause aging, and how [[antioxidant]]s were said to partially prevent the damage they do.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| first=Dennis |last=Fiely |title='Biochemical bad boys' - Possible causes of disease, free radicals, may have met their match |publisher=Columbus Dispatch |date=1993-09-16 |accessdate=2007-03-01 |url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:AWNB:CLDB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=10E0DA583AA751E0&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated4&amp;req_dat=0D0CB57AB53DF815}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book suggests causes of aging and ways to slow them, with material on improving health and various aspects of the quality of life.

One notable feature of the book was several full-page pictures of its male and female authors, Durk Pearson and Sandy Shaw, striking bodybuilding poses and showing off some impressive muscles for "sedentary research scientists," which they claimed was due to the "growth hormone releasers" they took daily.
 
== Criticism ==
 
Medical health experts have dismissed Pearson and Shaw's life-extension formula as dangerous. The [[American Council on Science and Health]] reported that the risks of their formula included headaches, intestinal disorders and kidney damage.&lt;ref&gt;Renner, John H. (1990). ''HealthSmarts: How to Spot the Quacks, Avoid the Nonsense, and Get the Facts that Affect Your Health''. Health Facts Publishing. p. 80. {{ISBN|978-0962614507}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the 1992 [[documentary]] ''Never Say Die: The Pursuit of Eternal Youth'', Antony Thomas interviewed Pearson and Shaw, and criticised the anti-aging movement as misguided.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=The often gruesome search for perpetual youth |first=Virginia |last=Mann |publisher=The Record newspaper|date=1992-08-17 |accessdate=2007-03-01 |url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:AWNB:BRCB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=0EB2778DA83E3DCC&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated4&amp;req_dat=0D0CB57AB53DF815 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A review in ''[[JAMA (journal)|JAMA: The Journal of the American Medical Association]]''  by researchers with the  Harvard School of Public Health advised that “Some of the "health" advice contained in this book would be humorous if it was not so dangerous” and that “Potential readers of this ridiculous book would be wiser to take only the antacids—as we felt the urge to do after the realization that we had spent $22.50 on an unscientific, impractical, and potentially dangerous health fraud that literally made us ill.”&lt;ref name="Stare &amp; Aronson, 1983"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stare|first=Fredrick J.|author2=Aronson, Virginia |title=Life Extension: A Practical Scientific Approach|journal=JAMA|date=November 23, 1983|volume=250|issue=20|pages=2862–3|url=http://jama.jamanetwork.com/pdfaccess.ashx?ResourceID=526884&amp;PDFSource=13|accessdate=2 June 2012|doi=10.1001/jama.1983.03340200094043}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Stephen Barrett]] of [[Quackwatch]] wrote that the advice in the book was impractical and unscientific. For example the authors recommended more than thirty  supplements and prescription drugs and for the subject to take a medical examination with more than fifty laboratory tests. The authors made inaccurate statements about [[Multivitamin|vitamin supplements]] and their "presentation of experimental data is biased and uncritical."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.quackwatch.org/04ConsumerEducation/NegativeBR/le.html "Book Review: Life Extension: A Practical Scientific Approach (1982)"]. [[Quackwatch]]. Retrieved November 22, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nutritionist Kurt Butler has described the book as a [[hoax]] and has written:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Pearson and Shaw denigrate exercise and claim that all its benefits can be had by taking the pills and remaining sedentary. Many experts believe that following their advice is more likely to accelerate aging rather than retard it. This is because the so-called antioxidants in their regimen are actually redox agents that act as pro-oxidants when taken in the doses the authors recommend, and because exercise is the best proven anti-aging tool available to us.&lt;ref&gt;Butler, Kurt. (1999). ''Lying for Fun and Profit: The Truth about the Media: Exposes the Corrupt Symbiosis Between Media Giants and the Health Fraud Industries''. Health Wise Productions. p. 85. {{ISBN|978-0967328102}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

[[Gerontology#Biogerontology|Biogerontologist]] Dr. [[Roy Walford]] wrote, "[[gerontology]] has always been the happy hunting ground for faddists, charlatans, pseudoscientific fringe characters, and just misinformed enthusiasts with 'ready cures' for aging. ... Pearson and Shaw are among this long list of enthusiasts. ... Most of the Pearson/Shaw book relies on this lower-order category of evidence, and upon the testimonial posturing of Pearson and Shaw themselves."&lt;ref name=Walford&gt;{{cite book|last=Walford|first=Roy|title=Beyond the 120 Year Diet: How to Double Your Vital Years|year=2000|publisher=Four Walls Eight Windows|location=New York, NY|isbn= 9781568581576|pages=21–23|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I0GeWFLLbQEC&amp;pg=PA21&amp;lpg=PA21}}&lt;/ref&gt;   In a discussion group posting, biogerontologist Dr. Steve Harris, MD criticizes the book, offering an example of one the authors' "screwups:"
:: I managed to track one of their references to the (supposedly) somniferous effects of inositol back through some of the primary literature they'd cited (loosely) in the back of the chapter. Wups, guess what? They'd been reading a paper on natural ligands of the benzodiazepine receptor, and confused inositol with inosine (helped out by [[Carl Pfeiffer (pharmacologist)| [Carl] Pffeifer]]'s [sic] claims that inositol is sleep inducing). Inosine actually HAS some demonstrated Valium like effects in some animals (birds), but to this day you're going to see inositol in sleep remedies.&lt;ref name="Harris, 1995"&gt;{{cite web|last=Harris|first=Steve|title=Re: Whats up with Pearson &amp; Shaw|url=http://groups.google.com/group/sci.life-extension/msg/3ba7eb3669464c37|accessdate=2 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Georgia===

Transcaucasian Trail:

A long distance trail in the caucasus has been a lingering idea for trekkers and hikers for many years since they started hiking remote parts of the Caucasus. 
Many sections of the TCT already exist, used by local community members and shepherds for centuries. These trail cross long valleys and traverse mammoth mountains to connect mountain villages together. Unfortunately, in recent years many of these trails have fallen into disrepair, and while many trails are known to locals, they are difficult to navigate for visitors and tourists. 
In 2015, two Peace Corps volunteers, Paul Stephens and Jeff Haack, mapped and charted known routes in The Republic of Georgia. During this time they succeeded in locating many connections between known trails and publicizing the concept of the trail. In 2016, Tom Allen and Alessandro Mambelli scouted new trail routes in Armenia while the first trail building project began in Svaneti, Georgia. In 2017, the trail building expanded to Dilijan National Park in Armenia while trail building continued in the Svaneti region. 
Today, over 300 km of trail has been improved and marked in Georgia and Armenia. Many 7-10 day guided hikes are available on the TCT this summer. Over the next 5 years, the trail will be expanded to connect all of the sections and create even longer hikes.
The TCT can serve many purposes in the Caucasus region. For one, the natural diversity of the area needs to be protected. This habitat fosters many species of animal and provides unique ecosystems created by the mountains. 
More information about the trail can be found at transcaucasiantrail.org . 
Donations can be sustaining or one-time.

[[File:Bahji.jpg|thumb|The final place of exile of Bahá'u'lláh: the Mansion at Bahjí, [[Acre, Israel]].]]
[[File:Mansion of Bahji 2.jpg|thumb|Mansion of Bahjí]]
[[File:PikiWiki Israel 14856 BAHAI garden ACCO.jpg|thumb|[[Bahá'í gardens]] at Bahjí]]
The '''Mansion of Bahjí''' ({{lang-ar|قصر بهجي}}, Qasr Bahjī, ''mansion of delight'') is a summer house in [[Acre, Israel]] where [[Bahá'u'lláh]], the founder of the [[Bahá'í Faith]], died in 1892. [[Shrine of Bahá'u'lláh|His shrine]] is located next to this house. The whole area was called ''Al-Bahjá'' (''Place of Delight'').

The area was originally a garden planted by [[Sulayman Pasha al-Adil|Sulayman Pasha]], who was the ruler of Acre, for his daughter Fatimih, and he named it Bahji.&lt;ref name="Balyuzi362"&gt;{{Harvnb|Balyuzi|2000|p=362}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later the area was further beautified by `Abdu'llah Pasha, and in 1831 when [[Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt|Ibrahim Pasha]] besieged Acre he used the property as his headquarters.&lt;ref name="Balyuzi362"/&gt; The property was well known for its beautiful gardens and pond fed by an aqueduct.  The property then fell into the possession of a Christian family, the Jamals.&lt;ref name="Balyuzi362"/&gt;

In 1870 `Udi Khammar, a wealthy merchant from Acre who also originally owned the [[Bahá'í World Centre buildings#House of `Abbúd|House of `Abbúd]], bought some of the land from the Jamals close to the mansion of `Abdu'llah Pasha and built the Mansion of Bahji, over an earlier and smaller building, which Abdu'llah Pasha had had built for his mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ruhe |first=  David |editor1-last= |editor1-first= |date= 1983 |orig-year=| chapter= |title= Door of Hope: The Bahá'í Faith in the Holy Land  |url= |location= Oxford, England  |publisher= George Ronald Publisher Ltd |page= 106 |isbn = 978-0853981503 |author-link= David Ruhe}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Balyuzi362"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PSmith"&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|2000|pp=87–89}}&lt;/ref&gt; `Udi Khammar had built the house for his family, and when he died was buried in a tomb in the south-east corner of the wall directly around the building.&lt;ref name="Balyuzi362"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Taherzadeh"&gt;{{Harvnb|Taherzadeh|1987|p=103}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1879 an epidemic caused the inhabitants to flee and the building became vacant.

[[`Abdu'l-Bahá]] first rented, and then purchased, the mansion for Bahá'u'lláh and the [[Bahá'í Faith|Bahá'í]] holy family to live in, and Bahá'u'lláh moved from [[Mazra'ih]] to Bahji and resided in the building until his death.&lt;ref name="Balyuzi362"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Taherzadeh"/&gt; In 1890 the Cambridge orientalist [[Edward Granville Browne]] met Bahá'u'lláh in this house; after this meeting he wrote his famous [[Bahá'u'lláh#Bahj.C3.AD|pen-portrait of Bahá'u'lláh]].&lt;ref name="PSmith"/&gt; 

When Bahá'u'lláh died in 1892 he was interred in one of the surrounding buildings, and that building became the [[shrine of Bahá'u'lláh]].&lt;ref name="PSmith"/&gt; After his death in 1898, Bahá'u'lláh's son [[Bahá'u'lláh's family#Díyá'u'lláh|Díyá'u'lláh]]  was initially buried next to his father.  However, having been declared a [[Covenant-breaker]], Díyá'u'lláh's remains were disinterred in a "process" of "purification" through "cleansing" the "inner sanctuary" of the "most hallowed shrine", the "[[Qiblih]]" of the "Bahá'í World".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last= Marks |editor1-first= Geoffry W. |date=1996 |title=Messages from the Universal House of Justice 1963-86: The Third Epoch of the Formative Age |url= http://bahai-library.com/uhj_messages_1963-86_full&amp;chapter=3#66 |location= |publisher= Baha'i Publishing Trust |page=66 |isbn= 978-0877432395}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site has since been beautified with [[paradise garden]]s, which are termed ''Haram-i-Aqdas'' (the Most Holy Precincts or Sanctuary) and are intersected by a circular path which serves to [[Circumambulation|circumambulate]] the shrine of Bahá'u'lláh.&lt;ref name="PSmith"/&gt; The Mansion, shrine, and surrounding gardens are among the most sacred spots on earth for Bahá'ís and are [[Bahá'í pilgrimage]] sites.&lt;ref name="Balyuzi362"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PSmith"/&gt;

On November 12, 1952,  a cablegram sent by Shoghi Effendi announced the "acquisition of vitally-needed property" of the Mansion of Bahji and the area around it from "the [[Israel Land Authority| Development Authority of the State of Israel]]...The exchange of said property, including land and houses, was made possible by the [[1948 Palestinian exodus|precipitate flight of the former Arab owners]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Effendi |first= Shoghi | authorlink= Shoghi Effendi |date= 1971 |title= Messages To The Bahá'í World: 1950-1957 |url= http://bahai-library.com/shoghieffendi_messages_bahai_world |location= Wilmette, Illinois |chapter-url= http://bahai-library.com/writings/shoghieffendi/mbw/sec-25.html |chapter= Acquisition of Vitally-Needed Property |publisher= Bahá'í Publishing Trust |page= 45 |isbn= 978-0877430360 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13826">'''Neopluvial''' is a term referring to a phase of wetter and colder climate in the western United States in the late [[Holocene]],{{sfn|Hockett|2015|p=293}} causing the levels of lakes in the [[Great Basin]] to increase{{sfn|Hockett|2015|p=299}} and previously dry lakes and [[spring (hydrology)|spring]]s to refill.&lt;ref name="Pettigrew1984" /&gt; It is in part correlative to the [[Neoglacial]],{{sfn|Hockett|2015|p=292}} and might have been caused by a change in winter time conditions over the [[North Pacific]].{{sfn|Yuan|Koran|Valdez|2013|p=157}} It resembles the [[pluvial]] period that occurred in western North America during the late [[last glacial maximum]],{{sfn|Yuan|Koran|Valdez|2013|p=158}} but was much weaker than the LGM wet period.{{sfn|Madsen|2000|p=157}}

It has been observed in [[Great Salt Lake]],{{sfn|Madsen|2000|p=157}} [[Fallen Leaf Lake (California)|Fallen Leaf Lake]],&lt;ref name="NobleZimmernann2016" /&gt; [[Lake Cochise]],{{sfn|Yuan|Koran|Valdez|2013|p=155}} the [[Mojave Desert]],&lt;ref name="JonesKlar2007" /&gt; [[Mono Lake]], [[Owens Lake]], [[Pyramid Lake (Nevada)|Pyramid Lake]],&lt;ref name="NobleZimmernann2016" /&gt; [[San Luis Closed Basin|San Luis Lake]],{{sfn|Yuan|Koran|Valdez|2013|p=155}} [[Silver Lake, San Bernardino County, California|Silver Lake]],&lt;ref name="JonesKlar2007" /&gt; [[Summer Lake (Oregon)|Summer Lake]],&lt;ref name="Chewaucan" /&gt; [[Tulare Lake]]&lt;ref name="NegriniWigand2006" /&gt; and [[Walker Lake (Nevada)|Walker Lake]].&lt;ref name="NobleZimmernann2016" /&gt;

During the Neopluvial, the Great Salt Lake became fresher,{{sfn|Madsen|2000|p=157}} Pyramid Lake reached a water level of {{convert|1186|m}} above sea level;&lt;ref name="NobleZimmernann2016" /&gt; there is evidence for at least two highstands.{{sfn|Noble|Ball|Zimmerman|Maloney|2016|p=207}} Walker Lake, Owens Lake and Mono Lake experienced their highest Holocene water levels,&lt;ref name="NobleZimmernann2016" /&gt; with the volumes of the latter two lakes more than doubling.&lt;ref name="FutureW" /&gt; Likewise water levels in [[Lake Tahoe]] rose to the point of overflowing into the [[Truckee River]].{{sfn|Noble|Ball|Zimmerman|Maloney|2016|p=206}} Silver Lake in the Mojave Desert formed a perennial lake and vegetation was more widespread in the [[Little Granite Mountains]].&lt;ref name="JonesKlar2007" /&gt; Summer Lake rose above its present-day level to an elevation of {{circa}} {{convert|1278|m}},&lt;ref name="BadgerWatters2004" /&gt; although it was not as high as during the mid-Holocene.&lt;ref name="Chewaucan" /&gt; Water levels rose in Tulare Lake as well.&lt;ref name="NegriniWigand2006" /&gt;

In the [[White Mountains (California)|White Mountains]], [[meadow]]s formed during the Neopluvial.&lt;ref name="AbabnehWoolfenden2010" /&gt; [[Glacier]]s grew in the Sierra Nevada,{{sfn|Noble|Ball|Zimmerman|Maloney|2016|p=207}} [[sagebrush]] steppe, [[Ephedra viridis|green Mormon tea]] and other vegetation expanded in the Great Salt Lake region,{{sfn|Madsen|2000|p=161}} [[marsh]]es expanded in the central and northern [[Great Basin]],{{sfn|Hockett|2015|p=292}} [[mammal]] communities in the [[Lake Bonneville]] basin changed,{{sfn|Oviatt|Shroder|2016|p=363-364}} and [[tree line]]s dropped, with the lower limit of wooden vegetation penetrating into deserts.&lt;ref name="WestfallMillar2004" /&gt; Counterintuitively, higher tree line elevations in the [[Lake Bonneville]] area occurred during the Neopluvial.{{sfn|Oviatt|Shroder|2016|p=278}} In the [[Owens Valley]] region, during the Neopluvial the population became more sedentary and trans-[[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] trade became established ("Newberry"/"Middle Archaic Period").&lt;ref name="Ababneh2008" /&gt; Population around [[Alvord Lake (Oregon)|Lake Alvord]] increased during this time and lasted even after the Neopluvial had ended there.&lt;ref name="Pettigrew1984" /&gt;

The beginning of the Neopluvial occurred about 6,000 years before present, but did not occur everywhere at the same time. Rising water levels in Lake Tahoe drowned trees between 4,800 and 5,700 years before present.{{sfn|Noble|Ball|Zimmerman|Maloney|2016|p=206}} In the Great Salt Lake, the Neopluvial commenced 5,000 years before present and water levels reached their maximum between 3,000 and 2,000 years before present.{{sfn|Madsen|2000|p=157}} In Pyramid Lake, the Neopluvial commenced starting from 5,000 years [[before present]] and reached a maximum between 4,100 - 3,800 years before present in Pyramid Lake,&lt;ref name="NobleZimmernann2016" /&gt; between 4,000 and 2,000 years before present in the [[Carson Sink]],{{sfn|Noble|Ball|Zimmerman|Maloney|2016|p=207}} between 3,000 - 4,000 years before present in Lake Cochise,{{sfn|Yuan|Koran|Valdez|2013|p=155}} between 5,100 and 2,650 years before present in the central-northern Great Basin,{{sfn|Hockett|2015|p=292}} between 4,000 and 2,500 years before present in the Mojave Desert,&lt;ref name="JonesKlar2007" /&gt; between 4,000 and 1,900 years ago in the Summer Lake area,&lt;ref name="BadgerWatters2004" /&gt; and 3,700 years before present in Fallen Leaf Lake. The end of the Neopluvial in Fallen Leaf Lake occurred 3,650 years before present;&lt;ref name="NobleZimmernann2016" /&gt; after that point precipitation became more irregular until the onset of the [[Little Ice Age]] about 3,000 years later.{{sfn|Noble|Ball|Zimmerman|Maloney|2016|p=208}} In Tulare Lake, the Neopluvial lasted between 4,500 and 2,800 years before present; after that a severe [[drought]] occurred.&lt;ref name="NegriniWigand2006" /&gt; The Neopluvial in the [[Lake Lahontan]] basin ended about 2,000 years ago.&lt;ref name="Pettigrew1984" /&gt;

These broadly synchronous patterns in the Great Basin were paralleled in the Rocky Mountains.  High elevation lakes with small watersheds, particularly sensitive to a changing water balance, showed synchronous increase in lake levels from 6,000 to 5,000 years before present, centered at 5,700 years ago. This shift was followed by abundant evidence of [[neoglacial]] cooling throughout the northern hemisphere.  This cooling is primarily explained by steadily declining summer insolation, though synchronous patterns in hydrological responses at sub-millennial scales may be linked to atmospheric circulation shifts driven by factors such as internal variability in ocean-atmosphere teleconnections.{{Sfn|Shuman|Serravezza|2017|p=74}}

The term "neopluvial" has also been used for a mid-to-late Holocene phase of increased moisture noted in the form of increased wetness in eastern [[Texas]], potentially linked to a stronger [[monsoon]].&lt;ref name="WilkinsCurrey1999" /&gt;

==Religious belief==

[[File:WhereRainbowRises.jpg|thumb|upright|The proverbial "end" of a rainbow. An observer situated at that location would only see the rainbow end at a further distance.]] 
{{Main|Rainbows in mythology}}
The rainbow has a place in legend owing to its beauty and the historical difficulty in explaining the phenomenon.

In [[Greco-Roman mythology]], the rainbow was considered to be a path made by a messenger ([[Iris (mythology)|Iris]]) between Earth and Heaven.

In [[Chinese mythology]], the rainbow was a slit in the sky sealed by goddess [[Nüwa]] using stones of five different colours.

The Irish [[leprechaun]]'s secret hiding place for his pot of gold is usually said to be at the end of the rainbow. This place is impossible to reach, because the rainbow is an optical effect which depends on the location of the viewer. When walking towards the end of a rainbow, it will appear to "move" further away (two people who simultaneously observe a rainbow at different locations will disagree about where a rainbow is).

According to Genesis, after Noah's flood God put the rainbow in the sky as the sign of His promise that He would never again destroy the earth with flood (Genesis 9:13–17):&lt;ref&gt;''[[King James Version|Holy Bible: (King James Version.)]]'' (2004). Intellectual Reserve, inc.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;I do set my bow in the cloud, and it shall be for a token of a covenant between me and the earth. And it shall come to pass, when I bring a cloud over the earth, that the bow shall be seen in the cloud: And I will remember my covenant, which is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh. And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is upon the earth. And God said unto Noah, This is the token of the covenant, which I have established between me and all flesh that is upon the earth.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Rabbinic Judaism learns from this portion of the Bible that rainbows are a symbol of divine anger and patience. On the occasion of seeing a rainbow, a blessing is said, thanking God for promising to never again flood the world. As well, there were certain Rabbis who never had rainbows appear in their lifetimes, such as [[Simeon bar Yochai|Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai]] and [[Joshua ben Levi|Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi]].

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints founder and prophet Joseph Smith stated that the second coming of the Christ would not occur in any year in which a rainbow is seen.&lt;ref&gt;"I have asked of the Lord concerning His coming; and while asking the Lord, He gave a sign and said, "In the days of Noah I set a bow in the heavens as a sign and token that in any year that the bow should be seen the Lord would not come; but there should be seed time and harvest during that year: but whenever you see the bow withdrawn, it shall be a token that there shall be famine, pestilence, and great distress among the nations, and that the coming of the Messiah is not far distant."  Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith, Section Six 1843-44, p.340&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Dreamtime]] of [[Australian Aboriginal mythology]], the [[rainbow snake]] is the deity governing [[water]].

In [[Amazon Basin|Amazonian]] cultures, rainbows have long been associated with malign spirits that cause harm, such as miscarriages and (especially) skin problems. In the [[Yanesha' language|Amuesha]] language of central [[Peru]], certain diseases are called ''ayona’achartan'', meaning "the rainbow hurt my skin". A tradition of closing one's mouth at the sight of a rainbow in order to avoid disease appears to pre-date the Incan empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.jep.2009.09.024|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6T8D-4XFPR09-1&amp;_user=9544096&amp;_coverDate=01%2F08%2F2010&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=high&amp;_orig=search&amp;_origin=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;_docanchor=&amp;view=c&amp;_searchStrId=1448860523&amp;_rerunOrigin=google&amp;_acct=C000039618&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=9544096&amp;md5=55d589e8367329b7e92f31a06e4c7021&amp;searchtype=a |title=The rainbow hurts my skin: Medicinal concepts and plants uses among the Yanesha (Amuesha), an Amazonian Peruvian ethnic group|author1=Céline Valadeau |author2=Joaquina Alban Castillo |author3=Michel Sauvain |author4=Augusto Francis Lorese |author5=Geneviève Bourdy |journal= Journal of Ethnopharmacology| volume =127| issue= 1|date= January 8, 2010| pages= 175–192|pmid=19835943}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.amazonpromise.org/index.php?pagename=trad_med |title=Utilizing Western and Traditional Remedies in the Peruvian Amazon|author= Webster, Patty}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[New Age]] and [[Hindu philosophy]], the seven colours of the rainbow represent the seven [[chakra]]s, from the first chakra (red) to the seventh chakra (violet).

==Art==

Rainbows are generally described as very colourful and peaceful. The rainbow occurs often in paintings.&lt;ref&gt;Niels Hutchison. "Stairways to Heaven". Colour Music. http://www.colourmusic.info/rain.htm/&lt;/ref&gt; Frequently these have a symbolic or programmatic significance (for example, [[Albrecht Dürer]]'s [[Melancholia I]]). In particular, the rainbow appears regularly in religious art (for example, [[Joseph Anton Koch]]'s ''Noah's Thank Offering''). Romantic landscape painters such as [[J. M. W. Turner|Turner]] and [[John Constable|Constable]] were more concerned with recording fleeting effects of light (for example, Constable's [[Salisbury Cathedral from the Meadows]]). Other notable examples appear in work by [[Hans Memling]], [[Caspar David Friedrich]], and [[Peter Paul Rubens]].

In contemporary visual art, the rainbow often appears as well, notably in Peter Coffin's ''Untitled (Rainbow)'', 2005,&lt;ref&gt;Announcement on e-flux http://www.artandeducation.net/announcement/utah-museum-of-fine-arts-presents-the-smithson-effect/&lt;/ref&gt; and in Ugo Rondinone's ''Hell, Yes!'', 2001.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ugo Rondinone]]&lt;/ref&gt; Like many other cultural references to the rainbow, these either emphasize the possible sublimity of the natural world or the cheerfulness, joy, and celebration often culturally associated with a profusion of colors.

In 2012, American artist, [[Michael Jones McKean]] created a large-scale artwork, [http://www.therainbow.org/ ''The Rainbow''].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/05/23/michael-jones-mckean_n_1539378.html&lt;/ref&gt; The project created, impart, a fully sustainable prismatic rainbow using thousands of gallons of pressurized harvested rainwater, at times stretching several city blocks in size.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://michaeljonesmckean.com/interview-gaddy.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-12-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131217224432/http://michaeljonesmckean.com/interview-gaddy.html |archivedate=2013-12-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literature==
Judith Bauer Stamper's 1987 Find Your Fate book "Jem and The Holograms #3: The Secret of Rainbow Island ",  involves the reader in saving Rainbow Island,  a tropical island that frequently has rainbows.

American legend retelling ''The Rough Face Girl" involves the heroines seeing an invisible Chief,  who wears a rainbow as a sash.

Stephen King's 1985 book '[[It (novel)|It]]'' features a scene where Ben Hanscom sees a spray bow while fighting with Henry Bowers in The Barrens, and comments on finding gold at the end of it.

The 1983 ''[[Care Bears]] '' book "A Sister for Ben" involves Cheer Bear,  whose tummy symbol is a rainbow,  telling Ben he will see a rainbow when his sister says her first word.

Dan Piraro's comic strip ''[[Bizarro (comic strip)|Bizarro]]'' featured a 2008 cartoon about fictional pirate Rainbowbeard in response to Proposition 8.

The rainbow inspires metaphor and simile. [[Virginia Woolf]] in ''[[To the Lighthouse]]'' highlights the transience of life and Man's mortality through Mrs Ramsey's thought,
:''"it was all as ephemeral as a rainbow"''

[[William Wordsworth|Wordsworth's]] 1802 poem "[[My Heart Leaps Up]]" begins:
:''My heart leaps up when I behold''
::''A rainbow in the sky:''
:''So was it when my life began;''
:''So is it now I am a man;''
:''So be it when I shall grow old,''
::''Or let me die!...''

The [[Isaac Newton|Newtonian]] deconstruction of the rainbow is said to have provoked [[John Keats]] to lament in his 1820 poem "[[s:Lamia|Lamia]]":
:''Do not all charms fly''
:''At the mere touch of cold philosophy?''
:''There was an awful rainbow once in heaven:''
:''We know her woof, her texture; she is given''
:''In the dull catalogue of common things.''
:''Philosophy will clip an Angel's wings,''
:''Conquer all mysteries by rule and line,''
:''Empty the haunted air, and gnomed mine –''
:''Unweave a rainbow''

In contrast to this is [[Richard Dawkins]]; talking about his book ''[[Unweaving the Rainbow]]: Science, Delusion and the Appetite for Wonder'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;"My title is from [[Keats]], who believed that [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] had destroyed all the poetry of the rainbow by reducing it to the prismatic colours. Keats could hardly have been more wrong, and my aim is to guide all who are
tempted by a similar view, towards the opposite conclusion. Science is, or ought to be, the inspiration for great poetry."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Flags==

{{Main|Rainbow flag}}
Rainbow flags tend to be used as a sign of a new era, of hope, or of social change. Rainbow flags have been used in many places over the centuries: in the [[German Peasants' War]] in the 16th century, as a symbol of the [[Cooperative]] movement; as a [[Peace symbol#The Peace Rainbow Flag|symbol of peace]], especially in Italy; to represent the [[Tawantin Suyu]], or [[Inca]] territory, mainly in [[Peru]] and [[Bolivia]];&lt;ref name=fotw&gt;{{cite web|url=http://flagspot.net/flags/xi.html |title=Flagspot.net |publisher=Flagspot.net |date= |accessdate=2010-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; by some [[Druze]] communities in the Middle east; by the [[Jewish Autonomous Oblast]]; to represent the International Order of Rainbow for Girls since the early 1920s, and as a symbol of [[gay pride]] and [[LGBT social movements]] since the 1970s.&lt;ref name=Rainbow&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs.cmu.edu/user/scotts/bulgarians/rainbow-flag.html |title=The Rainbow Flag |accessdate=2007-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.metroweekly.com/2007/10/pride-flyin-flag/ |title=Pride-Flyin' Flag: Rainbow-flag founder marks 30-years anniversary |work=Metro Weekly | location = Washington DC  |author=Gilbert Baker |date=October 18, 2007 |accessdate=2008-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 1990s, Archibishop Desmond Tutu and President Nelson Mandela described the newly democratic South Africa as the "[[rainbow nation]]", also alluding to its diversity and multiculturalism.

'''''Solar Energy Perspectives''''' is a 2011 book by the [[International Energy Agency]].&lt;ref name=ie11&gt;[http://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/Solar_Energy_Perspectives2011.pdf Solar Energy Perspectives: full text (free download)]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Solar energy]] technologies come in various forms – [[solar heating]], [[solar photovoltaics]], [[solar thermal electricity]] – and can make considerable contributions to solving some of the most urgent problems the world now faces:&lt;ref name=ie11/&gt; 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The development of affordable, inexhaustible and clean solar energy technologies will have huge longer-term benefits. It will increase countries’ energy security through reliance on an indigenous, inexhaustible and mostly import-independent resource, enhance sustainability, reduce pollution, lower the costs of mitigating climate change, and keep fossil fuel prices lower than otherwise. These advantages are global. Hence the additional costs of the incentives for early deployment should be considered learning investments; they must be wisely spent and need to be widely shared.&lt;ref name=ie11/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''Solar Energy Perspectives'' builds upon past analyses of solar energy deployment contained in the ''World Energy Outlook'', ''Energy Technology Perspectives'' and several IEA ''Technology Roadmaps''. It aims at "offering an updated picture of current technology trends and markets, as well as new analyses on how solar energy technologies for electricity, heat and fuels can be used in the various energy consuming sectors, now and in the future".&lt;ref name=ie11/&gt;

It is based on a [[power electronics]] voltage-source converter and can act as either a source or sink of reactive [[AC power]] to an electricity network.  If connected to a source of power it can also provide active [[AC power]].  It is a member of the [[flexible AC transmission system|FACTS]] family of devices. It is inherently modular and electable.

These compensators are also usable to reduce voltage fluctuations.&lt;ref name="IEEE Conerence Publication 2017-3"&gt;{{cite web | title=STATCOM, an efficient means for flicker mitigation | website=IEEE Conference Publication | date=2017-12-18 | url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/747380/ | access-date=2017-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
Usually a STATCOM is installed to support electricity networks that have a poor [[power factor]] and often poor [[voltage regulation]].&lt;ref name="IEEE Conference Publication 2017"&gt;{{cite web | title=Voltage regulation by grid connected PV-STATCOM | website=IEEE Conference Publication | date=2017-12-18 | url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8081136/ | access-date=2017-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are however, other uses, the most common use is for voltage stability.

==Construction and operation==
A STATCOM is a voltage source converter (VSC)-based device, with the voltage source behind a reactor. The voltage source is created from a DC [[capacitor]] and therefore a STATCOM has very little active power capability. However, its active power capability can be increased if a suitable energy storage device is connected across the DC capacitor.
The reactive power at the terminals of the STATCOM depends on the amplitude of the voltage source. For example, if the terminal voltage of the VSC is higher than the AC voltage at the point of connection, the STATCOM generates reactive current; conversely, when the amplitude of the voltage source is lower than the AC voltage, it absorbs reactive power.&lt;ref name="IEEE Conference Publication 2017-4"&gt;{{cite web | title=Voltage profile improvements of Mosul city ring system by STATCOM reactive power control | website=IEEE Conference Publication | date=2017-12-18 | url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6490654/ | access-date=2017-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The response time of a STATCOM is shorter than that of a [[static VAR compensator]] (SVC)&lt;ref name="Hingorani Gyugyi 2017"&gt;{{cite web | last=Hingorani | first=Narain G. | last2=Gyugyi | first2=Laszlo | title=Static Shunt Compensators: SVC and STATCOM | website=Wiley-IEEE Press Books | date=2017-12-18 | doi=10.1109/9780470546802.ch5 | url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=5264273&amp;queryText=statcom&amp;ranges=1977_2002_Year | access-date=2017-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;, mainly due to the fast switching times provided by the [[Insulated gate bipolar transistor|IGBT]]s of the voltage source converter. The STATCOM also provides better reactive power support at low AC voltages than an SVC, since the reactive power from a STATCOM decreases linearly with the AC voltage (as the current can be maintained at the rated value even down to low AC voltage).

==Similar devices==
A [[static var compensator]] can also be used for voltage stability.  However, a STATCOM has better characteristics than an SVC.  When the system voltage drops sufficiently to force the STATCOM output current to its ceiling, its maximum reactive output current will not be affected by the voltage magnitude. Therefore, it exhibits constant current characteristics when the voltage is low under the limit.  In contrast the SVC's reactive output is proportional to the square of the voltage magnitude. This makes the provided reactive power decrease rapidly when voltage decreases, thus reducing its stability.  In addition, the speed of response of a STATCOM is faster than that of an SVC and the harmonic emission is lower, however STATCOMs typically exhibit higher losses and may be more expensive than SVCs, so the (older) SVC technology is still widespread.

'''''The Blood of a Poet''''' ({{lang-fr|'''Le sang d'un poète'''}}) (1930) is an [[avant-garde]] film directed by [[Jean Cocteau]], financed by [[Charles de Noailles]] and starring [[Enrique Riveros]], a Chilean actor who had a successful career in European films. Photographer [[Lee Miller]] made her only film appearance in this movie, which features an appearance by the famed [[acrobatics|aerialist]] [[Barbette (performer)|Barbette]].&lt;ref name = observer&gt;{{cite news

==Plot==
''The Blood of a Poet'' is divided into four sections. In section one, an artist sketches a face and is startled when its mouth starts moving. He rubs out the mouth, only to discover that it has transferred to the palm of his hand. After experimenting with the hand for a while and falling asleep, the artist awakens and places the mouth over the mouth of a female statue.

In section two, the statue speaks to the artist, cajoling him into passing through a mirror. The mirror transports the artist to a hotel, where he peers through several keyholes, witnessing such people as an [[opium]] smoker and a [[hermaphrodite]]. The artist is handed a gun and a disembodied voice instructs him how to shoot himself in the head. He shoots himself but does not die. The artist cries out that he has seen enough and returns through the mirror. He smashes the statue with a mallet.

In section three, some students are having a snowball fight. An older boy throws a snowball at a younger boy, but the snowball turns out to be a chunk of marble. The young boy dies from the impact.

In the final section, a card sharp plays a game with a woman on a table set up over the body of the dead boy. A theatre party looks on. The card sharp extracts an Ace of Hearts from the dead boy's breast pocket. The boy's [[guardian angel]] appears and absorbs the dead boy. He also removes the Ace of Hearts from the card sharp's hand and retreats up a flight of stairs and through a door. Realizing he has lost, the card sharp commits suicide as the theatre party applauds. A female player transforms into the formerly smashed statue and walks off through the snow, leaving no footprints. In the film's final moments the statue is shown with an [[ox]], a [[globe]], and a [[lyre]].

Intercut through the film, [[oneiric (film theory)|oneiric]] images appear, including spinning wire models of a human head and rotating double-sided masks.

==Cast==
*[[Enrique Riveros]] as the Poet
*[[Elizabeth Lee Miller]] as the Statue
*[[Pauline Carton]] as the Instructor of Children
*[[Odette Talazac]] as Audience Member
*[[Jean Desbordes]] as Louis XV Friend
*[[Fernand Dichamps]] as Audience Member
*[[Lucien Jager]] as Audience Member
*[[Feral Benga]] as the Guardian Angel
*[[Barbette (performer)|Barbette]]

==Production==
''The Blood of a Poet'' was funded by Charles, Vicomte de Noailles, who gave Cocteau 1,000,000 francs to make it. Cocteau invited the Vicomte and his wife [[Marie-Laure de Noailles]], along with several of their friends, to appear in a scene as a theatre party. In the scene, they talked among themselves and, on cue, began applauding. Upon seeing the completed film, they were horrified to learn that they were applauding a game of cards that ended with a suicide, which had been filmed separately. They refused to let Cocteau release the film with their scene included, so Cocteau re-shot it with the famed [[Drag queen|female impersonator]] [[Barbette (performer)|Barbette]] and some extras.&lt;ref name=newyorker&gt;[[Francis Steegmuller]], "An Angel, A Flower, A Bird", ''The New Yorker'', September 27, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Delayed release==
Shortly after the completion of the film, rumors began to circulate that it contained an anti-Christian message. This, combined with the riotous reception of another controversial Noailles-produced film, ''[[L'Âge d'Or|L'âge d'or]]'', led to Charles de Noailles' expulsion from the famous [[Jockey-Club de Paris]], and he was even threatened with excommunication by the [[Catholic Church]].&lt;ref name = newyorker /&gt; The furore caused the release of ''The Blood of a Poet'' to be delayed for more than a year.
==Reception==

On [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film holds an approval rating of 94% based on {{nowrap|18 reviews}}, with a [[weighted average]] rating of 7.7/10.&lt;ref name="rottomatoes"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Blood of a Poet (1930) - Rotten Tomatoes|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_blood_of_a_poet/|website=Rotten Tomatoes.com|publisher=Flixer|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Author and film critic [[Leonard Maltin]] awarded the film three out of four stars, calling it "Imaginative, dreamlike, and still a visual delight."&lt;ref name="MaltinGreen2010"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Leonard Maltin|author2=Spencer Green|author3=Rob Edelman|title=Leonard Maltin's Classic Movie Guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hLtaAAAAYAAJ|date=January 2010|publisher=Plume|isbn=978-0-452-29577-3|page=68}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Use British (Oxford) English|date=November 2012}}

The '''Triple Goddess''' has been adopted by many [[neopagan]]s as one of their primary deities. In common Neopagan usage the three female figures are frequently described as the [[Virginity|Maiden]], the [[Mother goddess|Mother]], and the [[Crone]], each of which symbolizes both a separate stage in the female life cycle and a [[Lunar phase|phase]] of the [[Moon]], and often rules one of the realms of earth, underworld, and the heavens. These may or may not be perceived as aspects of a greater single divinity. The [[Hecate|Goddess]] of [[Wicca]]'s [[Wiccan ditheism|duotheistic theology]] is sometimes portrayed as the Triple Goddess, her masculine consort being the [[Horned God]].

The term ''triple goddess'' can be used outside of Neopaganism to instead refer to historical [[Triple goddesses|goddess triads]] and single goddesses of three forms or aspects.

The Triple Goddess  was the subject of much of the writing of the prominent early and middle 20th-century poet, novelist and mythographer [[Robert Graves]], in his books ''[[The White Goddess]]'' and ''[[The Greek Myths]]'' as well as in his poetry and novels. Modern neo-pagan conceptions of the Triple Goddess have been heavily influenced by Robert Graves who regarded the Triple Goddess as the continuing muse of all true poetry and who speculatively reconstructed her ancient worship, drawing on the scholarship of his time, in particular [[Jane Ellen Harrison]] and other [[Cambridge Ritualists]]. The influential Hungarian scholar of Greek mythology [[Karl Kerenyi]] likewise perceived an underlying triple moon goddess in Greek mythology. More recently the prominent archaeologist [[Marija Gimbutas]] has argued for the ancient worship of a Triple Goddess in Europe, attracting much controversy, and her ideas also influence modern neo-paganism.

Many neopagan belief systems follow Graves in his use of the figure of the Triple Goddess, and it continues to be an influence on [[feminism]], [[literature]], [[Jungian psychology]] and [[literary criticism]].

==Origins==
The relationship between the neopagan Triple Goddess and ancient religion is disputed, although it is not disputed that triple goddesses were known to ancient religion; for example, in [[Stymphalus (Arcadia)|Stymphalos]], Hera was worshiped as a Girl, a Grown-up, and a Widow.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0160:book=8:chapter=22 Pausanias, ''Description of Greece'', 8.22.2]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ronald Hutton]], a scholar of neopaganism, argues that the concept of the triple moon goddess as Maiden, Mother, and Crone, each facet corresponding to a phase of the moon, is a modern creation of Robert Graves, drawing on the work of 19th and 20th century scholars such as especially [[Jane Ellen Harrison|Jane Harrison]]; and also [[Margaret Murray]], [[James Frazer]],  the other members of the "[[myth and ritual]]" school or [[Cambridge Ritualists]], and the occultist and writer [[Aleister Crowley]].&lt;ref&gt;''Triumph of the Moon'', p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; The Triple Goddess was here distinguished by Hutton from the prehistoric Great [[Mother Goddess]], as described by [[Marija Gimbutas]] and others, whose worship in ancient times he regarded as neither proven nor disproven&lt;ref&gt;''Triumph of the Moon'', p. 355-357&lt;/ref&gt; Nor did Hutton dispute that in ancient pagan worship "partnerships of three divine women" occurred; rather he proposes that Jane Harrison looked to such partnerships to help explain how ancient goddesses could be both virgin and mother (the third person of the triad being as yet unnamed). Here she was according to Hutton "extending" the ideas of the prominent archaeologist [[Sir Arthur Evans]] who in excavating [[Knossos]] in [[Crete]] had come to the view that prehistoric Cretans had worshiped a single mighty goddess at once virgin and mother. In Hutton's view Evans' opinion owed an "unmistakable debt" to the Christian belief in the [[Virgin Mary]].&lt;ref&gt;''Triumph of the Moon'', p.36-37&lt;/ref&gt;

As a poet and mythographer, Graves claimed a historical basis for the triple-goddess, and an ongoing tradition of her worship among poets. Although Graves's work is widely discounted by academics as pseudohistory  (see [[The White Goddess#Criticism|The White Goddess § Criticism]] and [[The Greek Myths#Reception|The Greek Myths § Reception]]), it continues to have a lasting influence on many areas of [[Neopaganism]].&lt;ref name="Greer" /&gt;

Author and Pagan scholar [[Raven Grimassi]], in his books ''Old World Witchcraft'' (Weiser, 2012), and ''The Witches’ Craft'' (Llewellyn 2002), points out that certain ancient writings are in sharp contrast against the views of scholars such as Ronald Hutton (who he specifically refers to).  Grimassi presents ancient literary writings that mention the basic concept of a Triformis goddess associated with Witchcraft.  One of his source examples appears in Lucan's ancient tale of a group of witches, written in the first century BCE. In Lucan's work (LUC. B.C. 6:700-01) the witches make the following comment: "''Persephone, who is the third and lowest aspect of our goddess Hecate''..." '''(Lucan: The Civil War, Harvard University Press, 2006)''.  Grimassi concludes that this source strongly suggests the concept of Witches having a triformis or three-fold goddess (and the notion appears almost two thousand years prior to Gerald Gardner's time).  Another source example offered by Grimassi is found in Ovid's tale (Met. 7:94–95) in which Jason swears an oath to the witch Medea, saying he would "''be true by the sacred rites of the three-fold goddess''" ''(Penguin Classics, Ovid Metamorphoses, 2004)''. Grimassi’s position is that these sources clearly demonstrate that, contrary to scholarly opinion, the basic concept of a triformis goddess venerated in Witchcraft is not a modern construction, and pre-exists the Romantic era and the work of Gerald Gardner and his cohorts. It is Grimassi's contention that the "Triple Goddess" in Neopaganism is rooted in ancient thought and literature, from which it is ultimately derived.

===Robert Graves===

and the imagery of three aspects, and related these to the Triple Goddess.&lt;ref&gt;Miranda Seymour, Robert Graves: life on the edge, p. 307&lt;/ref&gt;

Graves wrote extensively on the subject of the Triple Goddess who he saw as the Muse of all true poetry in both ancient and modern literature.&lt;ref&gt;The White Goddess Chapter One "Poets and Gleemen"&lt;/ref&gt; He thought that her ancient worship underlay much of classical Greek myth although reflected there in a more or less distorted or incomplete form. As an example of an unusually complete survival of the "ancient triad" he cites from the classical source [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] the worship of [[Hera]] in three persons.&lt;ref&gt;The White Goddess, Amended and Enlarged Edition, 1961, Chapter 21, "The Waters of Styx" page 368, Also "The Greek Myths" in several places.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]]  recorded the ancient worship of ''Hera Pais'' (Girl [[Hera]]), ''Hera Teleia'' (Adult Hera), and ''Hera Khera'' (Widow Hera, though ''Khera'' can also mean [[legal separation|separated]] or [[divorced]]) at a single sanctuary reputedly built by Temenus, son of [[Pelasgus#Pelasgus of Arcadia|Pelasgus]], in [[Stymphalus (Arcadia)|Stymphalos]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], ''Guide to Greece'' 8.22.2&lt;/ref&gt; Other examples he gives include the goddess triad [[Moirai|Moira]], [[Ilythia]] and Callone ("Death, Birth and Beauty") from [[Plato]]'s [[Symposium]];&lt;ref&gt;White Goddess, Amended and Enlarged Edition, 1961, Foreword, page 11&lt;/ref&gt; the goddess [[Hecate]]; the story of the rape of Kore, (the triad here Graves said to be [[Persephone|Kore]], [[Persephone]] and [[Hecate]] with [[Demeter]] the general name of the goddess); alongside a large number of other configurations.&lt;ref&gt;The Greek Myths, single edition, 1992, Penguin&lt;/ref&gt; A figure he used from outside of Greek myth was of the [[Akan people|Akan]] Triple Moon Goddess Ngame, who Graves said was still worshipped in 1960.&lt;ref&gt;White Goddess, Chapter 27,  Postcript 1960,&lt;/ref&gt;

Graves regarded "true poetry" as inspired by the Triple Goddess, as an example of her continuing influence in English poetry he instances the "Garland of Laurell" by the English poet, [[John Skelton]] (c.1460–1529) — ''Diana in the leavës green, Luna that so bright doth sheen, Persephone in Hell.'' — as evoking his Triple Goddess in her three realms of earth, sky and underworld.&lt;ref&gt;Graves, Robert (1948). ''The White Goddess: a Historical Grammar of Poetic Myth''. p.377.&lt;/ref&gt; Skelton was here following the Latin poet [[Ovid]].&lt;ref&gt;University of Virginia's "Ovid Illustrated" site, http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/latin/ovid/ovidillust.html, the lines from Skelton being explicitly sourced from Ovid in a note at http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/latin/ovid/trans/MetindexBCD.htm, retrieved 18 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; James Frazer's seminal [[Golden Bough]] centres around the cult of the Roman goddess [[Diana Nemorensis]] who had 3 aspects, ruling the sky, the earth and the underworld and was associated especially with the moon.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

Graves states that his Triple Goddess is the [[Mother goddess|Great Goddess]] "in her poetic or incantatory character", and that the goddess in her ancient form took the gods of the waxing and waning year successively as her lovers.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, Graham.

In the anthology ''[[The Greek Myths]]'' (1955), Graves systematically applied his convictions enshrined in ''The White Goddess'' to Greek mythology, exposing a large number of readers to his various theories concerning goddess worship in ancient Greece.&lt;ref&gt;Von Hendy, Andrew (2002).

Indiana University Press. p.354. {{ISBN|0-253-33996-0}}, {{ISBN|978-0-253-33996-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Graves posited that Greece had been settled by a matriarchal goddess-worshipping people before being invaded by successive waves of patriarchal [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] speakers from the north.  Much of Greek myth in his view recorded the consequent religious political and social accommodations until the final triumph of patriarchy. Graves did not invent this picture but drew from nineteenth and early twentieth century scholarship. This account has not been disproved, but alternative explanations have emerged, and it is not accepted as a consensus view.&lt;ref&gt;Hutton, Ronald (1997). [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb3284/is_n271_v71/ai_n28685054/ "The Neolithic Great Goddess: A Study in Modern Tradition"] from ''Antiquity'', March 1997. p.7 (online).  See also relevant Wikipedia articles, [[Dorian invasion]], [[Mycenaean Age]] [[Greek Dark Ages]]&lt;/ref&gt; The twentieth century archaeologist [[Marija Gimbutas]] (see below) also argued for a triple goddess-worshipping European neolithic modified and eventually overwhelmed by waves of partiarchal invaders although she saw this neolithic civilization as egalitarian and "matristic" rather than "matriarchal" in the sense of gynocratic.&lt;ref&gt;"Civilization of the Goddess" Marija Gimbutas&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1949 novel ''[[Seven Days in New Crete]]'', Graves extrapolated this theory into an imagined future society where the worship of the Triple Goddess (under the three aspects of the maiden archer [[Nimuë]], the goddess of motherhood and sexuality Mari, and the hag-goddess of wisdom Ana) is the main form of religion.

In her discussion of [[James Mellaart]]'s theories regarding [[Çatalhöyük]], Lynn Meskell says it is probable that the Triple Goddess originated&lt;ref&gt;Meskell, Lynn (1999).

(1999). ''Archaeology and Folklore''. Routledge. "It seems clear that the initial recording of Çatalhöyük [1961–1965] was largely influenced by decidedly Greek notions of ritual and magic, especially that of the Triple Goddess — maiden, mother, and crone. These ideas were common to many at that time, but probably originated with [[Jane Ellen Harrison]], Classical archaeologist and member of the famous Cambridge Ritualists (Harrison 1903)." {{ISBN|0-415-20144-6}}, {{ISBN|978-0-415-20144-5}}.&lt;br /&gt;See also: Hutton, Ronald (2001).

She argued that the original single one, representing the earth, had likewise been honoured in three roles.

[S]he declared that all male deities had originally been subordinate to the goddess as her lovers and her sons." {{ISBN|0-19-285449-6}}, {{ISBN|978-0-19-285449-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; with the work of [[Jane Ellen Harrison]].&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, Jane Ellen (1903).

''Themis: A Study of the Social Origins of Greek Religion''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. pp.189–192: "The three [[Horae]] are the three phases of the Moon, the Moon waxing, full, and waning. ... [T]he Moon is the true mother of the triple Horae, who are themselves [[Moirai]], and the Moirai, as Orpheus tells us, are but the three ''moirai'' or divisions (''μέρη'') of the Moon herself, the three divisions of the old year. And these three Moirai or Horae are also [[Charites]]."&lt;/ref&gt; and the three seasons of the ancient Greek year,&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, Jane Ellen (1903).

Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. p.288.&lt;/ref&gt; and notes that "[T]he matriarchal goddess may well have reflected the three stages of a woman's life."&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, Jane Ellen (1903). ''Prolegomena to the Study of Greek Religion''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. p.317.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ronald Hutton writes:&lt;blockquote&gt;[Harrison's] work, both celebrated and controversial, posited the previous existence of a peaceful and intensely creative woman-centred civilization, in which humans, living in harmony with nature and their own emotions, worshipped a single female deity. The deity was regarded as representing the earth, and as having three aspects, of which the first two were Maiden and Mother; she did not name the third. ...  Following her work, the idea of a matristic early Europe which had venerated such a deity was developed in books by amateur scholars such as Robert Briffault's ''The Mothers'' (1927) and Robert Graves's ''The White Goddess'' (1946).&lt;ref name="HuttonNGG3" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

John Michael Greer writes:&lt;blockquote&gt;Harrison proclaimed that Europe itself had been the location of an idyllic, goddess-worshipping, matriarchal civilization just before the beginning of recorded history, and spoke bitterly of the disastrous consequences of the [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-European]] invasion that destroyed it. In the hands of later writers such as Robert Graves, Jacquetta Hawkes, and Marija Gimbutas, this 'lost civilization of the goddess' came to play the same sort of role in many modern Pagan communities as Atlantis and Lemuria did in [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]].&lt;ref name="Greer" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The "[[myth and ritual]]" school or the [[Cambridge Ritualists]], of which Harrison was a key figure, while controversial in its day, is now considered passé in intellectual and academic terms.  According to Robert Ackerman, "[T]he reason the Ritualists have fallen into disfavor... is not that their assertions have been controverted by new information... Ritualism has been swept away not by an access of new facts but of new theories."&lt;ref&gt;Ackerman, Robert (2002).

[[Ronald Hutton]] wrote on the decline the "Great Goddess" theory specifically: "The effect upon professional prehistorians was to make most return, quietly and without controversy, to that careful agnosticism as to the nature of ancient religion which most had preserved until the 1940s. There had been no absolute disproof of the veneration of a Great Goddess, only a demonstration that the evidence concerned admitted of alternative explanations."&lt;ref&gt;Hutton, Ronald (1997).

Gimbutas postulated that in "Old Europe", the [[Aegean civilization|Aegean]] and the Near East, a great Triple Goddess was worshipped, predating what she deemed as a [[patriarchal]] religion imported by the [[Kurgan culture|Kurgans]], nomadic speakers of [[Indo-European languages]]. Gimbutas interpreted iconography from Neolithic and earlier periods of European history evidence of worship of a triple goddess represented by:
# "stiff nudes", birds of prey or poisonous snakes interpreted as "death"
# mother-figures interpreted as symbols of "birth and fertility"
# moths, butterflies or bees, or alternatively a symbols such as a frog, hedgehog or bulls head which she interpreted as being the uterus or fetus, as being symbols of "regeneration"&lt;ref&gt;Gimbutas, Marija (1991).

The first and third aspects of the goddess, according to Gimbutas, were frequently conflated to make a goddess of death-and-regeneration represented in folklore by such figures as [[Baba Yaga]]. Gimbutas regarded the [[Eleusinian Mysteries]] as a survival into classical antiquity of this ancient goddess worship,&lt;ref&gt;Gimbutas, Marija (1991). ''The Civilization of the Goddess: The World of Old Europe'', HarperSanFrancisco. p.243, and whole chapter "Religion of the Goddess". {{ISBN|0-06-250368-5}}, {{ISBN|978-0-06-250368-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; a suggestion which [[Georg Luck]] echos.&lt;ref&gt;[[Georg Luck|Luck, Georg]] (1985).

* The [[Maiden]] represents enchantment, inception, expansion, the promise of new beginnings, birth, youth and youthful enthusiasm, represented by the [[waxing moon]];
* The [[Mother (neopaganism)|Mother]] represents ripeness, fertility, sexuality, fulfilment, stability, power and life represented by the [[full moon]];
* The [[Crone]] represents wisdom, repose, death, and endings represented by the [[waning moon]].

The triple goddess sign is identified with Greek moon goddesses: 
* [[Artemis]] – the Maiden, because she is the virgin goddess of the hunt;
* [[Selene]] – the Mother, for she is the mother of [[Endymion (mythology)|Endymion]]'s children and loved him;
* [[Hecate]] – the Crone, as she is associated with the underworld and magic, and so considered to be "Queen of Witches".

===Dianic Wicca===

The [[Dianic tradition]] adopted Graves's Triple Goddess, along with other elements from Wicca, and is named after the Roman goddess [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]], the goddess of the witches in [[Charles Godfrey Leland]]'s 1899 book ''[[Aradia, or the Gospel of the Witches|Aradia]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Berger, Helen A. (2006).

[https://books.google.com/books?id=et09UA-9FZQC ''Women's Rites, Women's Mysteries: Intuitive Ritual Creation''.] Llewellyn. p.123. {{ISBN|0-7387-0924-7}}, {{ISBN|978-0-7387-0924-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Barrett says "Dianics honour ''She who has been called'' by Her daughters throughout time, in many places, and by many names."&lt;ref name="BarrettDianic" /&gt;

===Neopagan archetype theory===

Some neopagans assert that the worship of the Triple Goddess dates to pre-Christian Europe and possibly goes as far back as the [[Paleolithic|Paleolithic period]] and consequently claim that [[Witch-cult hypothesis|their religion is a surviving remnant of ancient beliefs]]. They believe the Triple Goddess is an [[archetypal]] figure which appears in a number of different cultures throughout human history, and that many individual goddesses can be interpreted as Triple Goddesses,&lt;ref name="Reid-Bowen" /&gt; The wide acceptance of an [[archetype]] theory has led to neopagans [[cultural appropriation|adopting the images and names of culturally divergent deities]] for ritual purposes;&lt;ref&gt;Rountree, Kathryn (2004).

===Jungian psychology===

Several advocates of Wicca, such as [[Vivianne Crowley]] and [[Selena Fox]], are practising psychologists or psychotherapists, and the work of Jung has had a large influence on their work.&lt;ref&gt;Morris, Brian (2006). [https://books.google.com/books?id=PguGB_uEQh4C&amp;lpg=PA286&amp;pg=PA286#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false ''Religion and Anthropology: a Critical Introduction''.] Cambridge University Press. p.286. {{ISBN|0-521-85241-2}}, {{ISBN|978-0-521-85241-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wouter J. Hanegraaff]] comments that Crowley's works can give the impression that Wicca is little more than a religious and ritual translation of Jungian psychology.&lt;ref&gt;Hanegraaff, Wouter J. (1996). [https://books.google.com/books?id=yV1ADS0XXf4C&amp;lpg=PA90&amp;pg=PA90#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false ''New Age Religion and Western Culture: Esotericism in the Mirror of Secular Thought''.] Brill, Leiden. p.90. {{ISBN|90-04-10696-0}}, {{ISBN|978-90-04-10696-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Triple Goddess as an [[Jungian archetypes|archetype]] is discussed in the works of [[Carl Jung]] and [[Karl Kerényi]],&lt;ref name="JungKerenyiEssays"&gt;Jung, C. G., and Kerényi, C. (1949). ''Essays on a Science of Mythology: the Myth of the Divine Child and the Mysteries of Eleusis''. Pantheon Books.&lt;/ref&gt; and the later works of their follower, [[Erich Neumann (psychologist)|Erich Neumann]].&lt;ref&gt;Neumann, Erich (1955). ''The Great Mother: an Analysis of the Archetype''. Pantheon Books.&lt;/ref&gt; Jung considered the general arrangement of deities in triads as a pattern which arises at the most primitive level of human mental development and culture.&lt;ref&gt;Jung, Carl Gustav (1942). "A Psychological Approach to the Dogma of the Trinity" (essay), in ''Collected Works : Psychology and Religion: West and East, Volume 11'' (2nd edition, 1966). Pantheon Books. p.113.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1949 Jung and Kerényi theorized that groups of three goddesses found in Greece become quaternities only by association with a male god. They give the example of Diana only becoming three (Daughter, Wife, Mother) through her relationship to Zeus, the male deity. They go on to state that different cultures and groups associate different numbers and cosmological bodies with gender.&lt;ref&gt;Jung, C. G., and Kerényi, C. (1949). ''Essays on a Science of Mythology: the Myth of the Divine Child and the Mysteries of Eleusis''. Pantheon Books. p.25.&lt;/ref&gt; "The threefold division [of the year] is inextricably bound up with the primitive form of the goddess Demeter, who was also Hecate, and Hecate could claim to be mistress of the three realms. In addition, her relations to the moon, the corn, and the realm of the dead are three fundamental traits in her nature. The goddess's sacred number is the special number of the underworld: '3' dominates the chthonic cults of antiquity."&lt;ref&gt;Jung, C. G., and Kerényi, C. (1949). ''Essays on a Science of Mythology: the Myth of the Divine Child and the Mysteries of Eleusis''. Pantheon Books. p.167.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Karl Kerenyi]], wrote in 1952 that several Greek goddesses were triple moon goddesses of the Maiden Mother Crone type, including [[Hera]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;For example Kerenyi writes in "Athene: Virgin and Mother in Greek Religion", 1978, translated from German by Murray Stein (German text 1952) Spring Publications, Zurich, :
"With Hera the correspondences of the mythological and cosmic transformation extended to all three phases in which the Greeks saw the moon: she corresponded to the waxing moon as maiden, to the full moon as fulfilled wife, to the waning moon as abandoned withdrawing women" (page 58) He goes on to say that trios of sister goddess in Greek myth refer to the lunar cycle; in the book in question he treats Athene also as a triple moon goddess, noting the statement by Aristotle that Athene was the Moon but not "only" the Moon.&lt;/ref&gt;

In discussing examples of his Great Mother archetype, Neumann mentions the Fates as "the threefold form of the Great Mother",&lt;ref&gt;Neumann, Erich (1955). ''The Great Mother: an Analysis of the Archetype''. Pantheon Books. p.226.&lt;/ref&gt; details that "the reason for their appearance in threes or nines, or more seldom in twelves, is to be sought in the threefold articulation underlying all created things; but here it refers most particularly to the three temporal stages of all growth (beginning-middle-end, birth-life-death, past-present-future)."&lt;ref&gt;Neumann, Erich (1955). ''The Great Mother: an Analysis of the Archetype''. Pantheon Books. p.230.&lt;/ref&gt; Andrew Von Hendy claims that Neumann's theories are based on circular reasoning, whereby a [[Eurocentric]] view of world mythology is used as evidence for a universal model of individual psychological development which mirrors a [[sociocultural evolution]]ary model derived from European mythology.&lt;ref&gt;Von Hendy, Andrew (2002). [https://books.google.com/books?id=rYNeAoovzw0C&amp;pg=RA1-PA186&amp;lpg=RA1-PA186#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false ''The Modern Construction of Myth''], 2nd edition. Indiana University Press. pp.186–187. {{ISBN|0-253-33996-0}}, {{ISBN|978-0-253-33996-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Valerie H. Mantecon follows Annis V. Pratt that the Triple Goddess of Maiden, Mother and Crone is a male invention that both arises from and biases an androcentric view of femininity, and as such the symbolism is often devoid of real meaning or use in depth-psychology for women.&lt;ref&gt;Pratt, Annis V. (1985). "Spinning Among Fields: Jung, Frye, Levi-Strauss and Feminist Archetypal Theory", in Estella Lauter, Carol Schreier Rupprecht (eds.) (1985). ''Feminist Archetypal Theory: Interdisciplinary Re-Visions of Jungian Thought''. University of Tennessee Press. {{ISBN|0-7837-9508-4}}, {{ISBN|978-0-7837-9508-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Mantecon suggests that a feminist re-visioning of the Crone symbolism away from its usual associations with "death" and towards "wisdom" can be useful in women transitioning to the menopausal phase of life and that the sense of history that comes from working with mythological symbols adds a sense of meaning to the experience.&lt;ref&gt;Mantecon, Valerie H. (1993). "Where Are the Archetypes? Searching for Symbols of Women's Midlife Passage", pp.83–87, in Nancy D. Davis, Ellen Cole, Esther D. Rothblum (eds.) (1993).

===Goddess Feminism and social critique===
The figure of the Triple Goddess is used by goddess feminists to critique societies' roles and treatment of women. Literary critic Jeanne Roberts sees a rejection of the crone figure by Christians in the Middle Ages as a root cause of the persecution of witches.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, Jeanne Addison (1994). ''The Shakespearean Wild: Geography, Genus, and Gender''. University of Nebraska Press. ''passim''. {{ISBN|0-8032-8950-2}}, {{ISBN|978-0-8032-8950-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fiction, film and literary criticism==
Author [[Margaret Atwood]] recalls reading Graves's ''The White Goddess'' at the age of 19. Atwood describes Graves' concept of the Triple Goddess as employing violent and [[misandric]] imagery, and says the restrictive role this model places on creative women put her off being a writer.&lt;ref&gt;Atwood, Margaret (2002). [https://books.google.com/books?id=jLbFlsKMIOQC&amp;lpg=PA85&amp;pg=PA85#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false ''Negotiating with the Dead: A Writer on Writing''.] Cambridge University Press. p.85. {{ISBN|0-521-66260-5}}, {{ISBN|978-0-521-66260-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Atwood's work has been noted as containing Triple Goddess motifs who sometimes appear failed and parodic.&lt;ref&gt;[[Reingard M. Nischik]] (2000). ''Margaret Atwood: Works and Impact''. Boydell &amp; Brewer. {{ISBN|1-57113-139-6}}, {{ISBN|978-1-57113-139-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Atwood's ''[[Lady Oracle]]'' has been cited as a deliberate parody of the Triple Goddess, which subverts the figure and ultimately liberates the lead female character from the oppressive model of feminine creativity that Graves constructed.&lt;ref&gt;Bouson, J.

Literary critic Andrew D. Radford, discussing the symbolism of [[Thomas Hardy]]'s 1891 novel ''[[Tess of the d'Urbervilles]]'', in terms of Myth sees the Maiden and Mother as two phases of the female lifecycle through which Tess passes, whilst the Crone phase, Tess adopts as a disguise which prepares her for harrowing experiences .&lt;ref&gt;Radford, Andrew D. (2007) [https://books.google.com/books?id=DorQmm7B-5sC&amp;lpg=PT129&amp;pg=PT129#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false ''The Lost Girls: Demeter-Persephone and the Literary Imagination, 1850–1930''], Volume 53 of ''Studies in Comparative Literature''.

[[Thomas DeQuincey]] developed a female trinity, Our Lady of Tears, the Lady of Sighs and Our Lady of Darkness, in ''Suspiria De Profundis'', which has been likened to Graves's Triple Goddess but stamped with DeQuincey's own melancholy sensibility.&lt;ref name="Andriano"&gt;Andriano, Joseph (1993).

According to scholar Juliette Wood, modern fantasy fiction plays a large part in the conceptual landscape of the neo-pagan world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wood|first=Juliette|title=The Concept of the Goddess|editor=Sandra Billington, Miranda Green (eds.)

Fantagraphics. p.151. {{ISBN|1-56097-748-5}}, {{ISBN|978-1-56097-748-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alan Garner]]'s ''[[The Owl Service]]'', based on the fourth branch of the ''[[Mabinogion]]'' and influenced by Robert Graves, clearly delineates the character of the Triple Goddess. Garner goes further in his other novels, making every female character intentionally represent an aspect of the Triple Goddess.&lt;ref name="White"&gt;White, Donna R. (1998). [https://books.google.com/books?id=yDVykkOOP6QC&amp;lpg=PA75&amp;pg=PA75#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false ''A Century of Welsh Myth in Children's Literature''.] Greenwood Publishing Group. p.75. {{ISBN|0-313-30570-6}}, {{ISBN|978-0-313-30570-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[George R.R. Martin]]'s ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' series, the Maid, the Mother, and the Crone are three aspects of the septune deity in the [[Poor fellows|Faith of the Seven]], much as the neopagan triple goddess is incorporated in Marion Zimmer Bradley's ''[[The Mists of Avalon]]''. [[Terry Pratchett]] has also incorporated variations on this theme. 

Graves's Triple Goddess motif has been used by Norman Holland to explore the female characters in [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s film ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Holland, Norman Norwood (2006). [https://books.google.com/books?id=jDHP-H-ICOMC&amp;lpg=PA43&amp;pg=PA43#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false ''Meeting Movies''.] Fairleigh Dickinson University Press. p.43. {{ISBN|0-8386-4099-0}}, {{ISBN|978-0-8386-4099-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roz Kaveney]] sees the main characters in [[James Cameron]]'s movie ''[[Aliens (film)|Aliens]]'' as: The Alien Queen (Crone), Ripley (Mother) and Newt (Maiden).&lt;ref&gt;Kaveney, Roz (2005).

American heavy metal band [[The Sword]]'s song, "Maiden, Mother &amp; Crone", on their album ''[[Gods of the Earth]]'', describes an encounter with the Triple Goddess. The video prominently features three aspects of the goddess and a waxing, full, and waning moon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://radioexile.com/2010/08/21/video-hook-up-the-sword-maiden-mother-crone/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-08-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100824164159/http://radioexile.com/2010/08/21/video-hook-up-the-sword-maiden-mother-crone/ |archivedate=2010-08-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There has also been references to the Triple Moon Goddesses on K-pop group [[Loona (band)|Loona's]] [[Odd Eye Circle|Odd Eye Circle,]] as each of the three members are portrayed as the goddesses.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2549">The '''universality–diversity paradigm''' is the analysis of biological materials based on the universality and diversity of its fundamental structural elements and functional mechanisms. The analysis of biological systems based on this classification has been a cornerstone of modern [[biology]].

For example, [[protein]]s constitute the elementary building blocks of a vast variety of biological materials such as cells, spider silk or bone, where they create extremely robust, multi-functional materials by self-organization of structures over many length- and time scales, from nano to macro. Some of the structural features are commonly found in many different tissues, that is, they are highly conserved. Examples of such universal building blocks include alpha-helices, beta-sheets or tropocollagen molecules. In contrast, other features are highly specific to tissue types, such as particular
filament assemblies, beta-sheet nanocrystals in spider silk or tendon fascicles. This coexistence of universality and diversity—referred to as the universality–diversity paradigm (UDP)—is an overarching feature in biological materials and a crucial component of [[materiomics]]. It might provide guidelines for bioinspired and biomimetic material development, where this concept is translated into the use of inorganic or hybrid organic-inorganic building blocks.
