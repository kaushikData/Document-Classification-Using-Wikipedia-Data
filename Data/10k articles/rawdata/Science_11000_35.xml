'''''A Philosopher Lecturing on the Orrery''''', or the full title, '''''A Philosopher giving a Lecture on the Orrery in which a lamp is put in place of the Sun''''', is a painting by [[Joseph Wright of Derby]] depicting a lecturer giving a demonstration of an [[orrery]] to a small audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.search.revolutionaryplayers.org.uk/engine/resource/exhibition/standard/child.asp?txtKeywords=&amp;lstContext=&amp;lstResourceType=&amp;lstExhibitionType=&amp;chkPurchaseVisible=&amp;txtDateFrom=&amp;txtDateTo=&amp;x1=&amp;y1=&amp;x2=&amp;y2=&amp;scale=&amp;theme=&amp;album=&amp;resource=5230&amp;viewpage=%2Fengine%2Fresource%2Fexhibition%2Fstandard%2Fdefault%2Easp&amp;originator=&amp;page=&amp;records=&amp;direction=&amp;pointer=&amp;text=&amp;exhibition=1652&amp;offset=0 | title=A Philosopher Lecturing on the Orrery (1764–1766) | accessdate=12 August 2011 | work=Revolutionary Players | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724091137/http://www.search.revolutionaryplayers.org.uk/engine/resource/exhibition/standard/child.asp?txtKeywords=&amp;lstContext=&amp;lstResourceType=&amp;lstExhibitionType=&amp;chkPurchaseVisible=&amp;txtDateFrom=&amp;txtDateTo=&amp;x1=&amp;y1=&amp;x2=&amp;y2=&amp;scale=&amp;theme=&amp;album=&amp;resource=5230&amp;viewpage=%2Fengine%2Fresource%2Fexhibition%2Fstandard%2Fdefault.asp&amp;originator=&amp;page=&amp;records=&amp;direction=&amp;pointer=&amp;text=&amp;exhibition=1652&amp;offset=0 | archivedate=24 July 2011 | deadurl=yes | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The painting preceded his similar ''[[An Experiment on a Bird in the Air Pump]]'' ([[National Gallery, London]]).

The first of Wright's candlelit masterpieces, ''[[Three Persons Viewing the Gladiator by Candlelight]]'', was painted in 1765, and showed three men studying a small copy of the "[[Borghese Gladiator]]". The ''Gladiator'' was greatly admired; but his next painting, ''The Orrery'', caused a greater stir, as it replaced the Classical subject at the centre of the scene with one of a scientific nature. Wright's depiction of the awe produced by scientific "miracles" marked a break with previous traditions in which the artistic depiction of such wonder was reserved for religious events,&lt;ref&gt;Brooke 1991, p. 178&lt;/ref&gt; since to Wright the marvels of the technological age were as awe-inspiring as the subjects of the great religious paintings.&lt;ref&gt;Nicolson 1968, p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; In both of these works the candlelit setting had a realist justification. Viewing sculpture by candlelight, when the contours showed well, and there might even be an impression of movement from the flickering light, was a fashionable practice described by [[Goethe]].&lt;ref&gt;Guilding, p. 83&lt;/ref&gt; In the orrery demonstration the shadows cast by the lamp representing the sun were an essential part of the display. But there seems no reason other than heightened drama to stage the air pump experiment in a room lit by a single candle, and in two later paintings of the subject by [[Charles-Amédée-Philippe van Loo]] the lighting is normal.&lt;ref&gt;Egerton, 1998, 342&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting was one of a number of British works challenging the set categories of the rigid, French-dictated, [[hierarchy of genres]] in the late 18th century, as other types of painting aspired to be treated as seriously as the costumed [[history painting]] of a Classical or mythological subject. In some respects the ''Orrery'' and ''Air Pump'' subjects resembled [[Conversation piece (paintings)|conversation pieces]], then largely a form of middle-class portraiture, though soon to be given new status when [[Johann Zoffany]] began to paint the royal family in about 1766. Given their solemn atmosphere however, and as it seems none of the figures are intended to be understood as portraits (even if models may be identified), the paintings can not be regarded as conversation pieces.&lt;ref&gt;Waterhouse (1978), pp. 215–216, 270, 285–286&lt;/ref&gt; The 20th-century art historian [[Ellis Waterhouse]] compares these two works to the "''genre serieux''" of contemporary French drama, as defined by [[Denis Diderot]] and [[Pierre Beaumarchais]], a view endorsed by Egerton.&lt;ref&gt;Waterhouse (1978), pp. 285–286, and Egerton (1998), p. 334&lt;/ref&gt;

An anonymous review from the time called Wright "a very great and uncommon genius in a peculiar way".&lt;ref name="DS"&gt;Solkin 1994, p. 234&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Orrery'' was painted without a commission, probably in the expectation that it would be bought by [[Washington Shirley, 5th Earl Ferrers|Washington Shirley]], [[Earl Ferrers|5th Earl Ferrers]], an amateur astronomer who had an [[orrery]] of his own, and with whom Wright's friend [[Peter Perez Burdett]] was staying while in [[Derbyshire]]. Figures thought to be portraits of Burdett and Ferrers feature in the painting, Burdett taking notes and Ferrers seated with a youth next to the orrery.&lt;ref&gt;Baird, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;
Ferrers purchased the painting for £210, but [[Robert Shirley, 6th Earl Ferrers|the 6th Earl]] auctioned it off, and it is now held by [[Derby Museum and Art Gallery]],&lt;ref name="Lunar"&gt;Uglow 2002, p. 123&lt;/ref&gt; where it is on permanent display, and close to a working replica of a full-sized mechanical [[orrery|Grand Orrery]].

A biographer of Wright, [[Benedict Nicolson]], argued in 1968 that [[John Whitehurst]] was the model for the lecturer,&lt;ref&gt;Nicolson, Benedict, ''Joseph Wright of Derby: painter of light'', Taylor &amp; Francis, 1968, {{ISBN|0-7100-6284-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; while another commentator points out the figure's resemblance to "a painting of [[Isaac Newton]] by [[Godfrey Kneller]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.derby.gov.uk/LeisureCulture/MuseumsGalleries/ArttreasureTheOrrery.htm |title=Art treasure – The Orrery |publisher=Derby City Council |language= |accessdate=12 August 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724223647/http://www.derby.gov.uk/LeisureCulture/MuseumsGalleries/ArttreasureTheOrrery.htm |archivedate=24 July 2011 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Close observation of the adult faces in the picture reveals that each one demonstrates one or other of the main [[Lunar phase|phases of the moon]] – new moon, half moon, gibbous moon and full moon.&lt;ref&gt;The Orrery – A Users' Guide, N J Moyes, Derby Museum and Art Gallery, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Abell 222''' is a [[galaxy cluster]] in the [[constellation]] of [[Cetus]]. It holds thousands of [[galaxies]] together. It is located at a distance of 2.4 billion light-years from [[Earth]].&lt;ref name=csmonitor&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/Science/2012/0705/Cosmic-scaffolding-uncovered-Scientists-find-thread-of-dark-matter |title=Cosmic scaffolding uncovered?

==Discovery of dark matter==
Astronomers noticed an invisible string of matter was warping [[spacetime]] between Abell 222 and [[Abell 223]]. Upon further examination by using images from the Japanese Subaru telescope, astronomers discovered that this "invisible matter" is in fact [[dark matter]]. The astronomers used [[gravitational lens]]ing to detect the dark matter filaments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.science20.com/news_articles/dark_matter_filaments_detected_abell_222_and_abel_223_supercluster-91809|title=Dark Matter Filaments Detected In Abell 222 And Abel 223 Supercluster|date=2014-08-27|website=Science 2.0|language=en|access-date=2017-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cluster is connected by a filament of dark matter to [[Abell 223]] that is permeated by hot X-ray emitting gas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esa.int/esa-mmg/mmg.pl?idf=SEMHZOZXUFF&amp;type=I|title=ID: SEMHZOZXUFF: Galaxy clusters Abell 222 and Abell 223|publisher=esa|accessdate=2012-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further research shows that this filament only contains about 20 percent of normal matter, the rest is assumed to be dark matter. This is seen to be in good agreement with the [[Physical cosmology|cosmological standard model]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Baryonic matter==
{{main|Baryon}}
5% of the universe is made up of baryonic or ordinary matter which contains protons and neutrons, also known as baryons, and electrons. Baryons and electrons are the foundation for atoms. Astronomers have not been able to locate the full 5% of baryonic matter within other galaxies, stars or gases.  After observing gas that connects Abell 222 and Abell 223, scientists believe that the missing baryonic matter is within the gas that bridges the two galaxy clusters. This was difficult to locate due to the fact that the gas had a very low density, which made it hard to detect. This discovery was made possible because of Abell 222’s location. It is within Earth’s line of sight, so scientists were able to see a strong concentration of this gas within a section of the sky.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.science20.com/news_releases/do_abell_222_and_abell_223_contain_the_universes_missing_baryonic_matter|title=Do Abell 222 And Abell 223 Contain The Universe's 'Missing' Baryonic Matter?|date=2014-08-27|website=Science 2.0|language=en|access-date=2017-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Achille Guenée''' (sometimes '''M.A. Guenée'''; 1 January 1809 – 30 December 1880) was a French lawyer and [[entomologist]].

==Biography==
Achille Guenée was born in [[Chartres]] and died in [[Châteaudun]].

He was educated in Chartres, where he showed a very early interest in [[butterflies]] and was encouraged and taught by [[François de Villiers]] (1790–1847). He went to study law in Paris, then entered the “Bareau”. After the death of his only son, he lived at Châteaudun in [[Chatelliers]]. During the [[Franco-Prussian War]] of 1870, Châteaudun was burned by the Prussians but Guénée’s collections remained intact.

He was the author of 63 publications, some with [[Philogène Auguste Joseph Duponchel]] (1774–1846). He notably wrote ''Species des nocturnes '' (''Night Species'' in English) (six volumes, 1852–1857) forming parts of the ''[[Suites à Buffon]]''. This work of almost 1,300 pages treats [[Noctuidae]] of the world. Also co-author, with [[Jean Baptiste Boisduval]], of ''Histoire naturelle des Insectes. Species général des Lépidoptères'' (vols 5–10, 1836–57).

He was a founding member 1832 of the [[Société Entomologique de France]], (1832) and was president in 1848 then honorary member in 1874. He was among the first to describe the ''[[Cadra calidella]]'' species.&lt;ref&gt;"GlobIZ search". Global Information System on Pyraloidea. Retrieved June 21, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Albrecht Penck Glacier''' ({{coord|76|40|S|162|20|E|type:glacier_region:AQ|display=inline,title}}) is a [[glacier]] between the [[Fry Glacier]] and the [[Evans Piedmont Glacier]], draining northeast toward [[Tripp Bay]] on the coast of [[Victoria Land]], [[Antarctica]]. It was first charted by the [[Nimrod Expedition|British Antarctic Expedition]] (1907&amp;ndash;09) which named this feature for [[Albrecht Penck]], the Director of the Institute of Oceanography and of the Geographical Institute in [[Berlin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{usgs-gazetteer|id=204}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Aram Chaos''', centered at 2.6°N, 21.5°W,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://planetarynames.wr.usgs.gov/jsp/FeatureNameDetail.jsp?feature=60508|title=Gazetteer of Planetary Nomenclature|accessdate=2006-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a heavily eroded [[impact crater]] on the planet [[Mars]]. It lies at the eastern end of the large canyon [[Valles Marineris]] and close to [[Ares Vallis]]. Various geological processes have reduced it to a circular area of [[chaotic terrain]].  Aram Chaos takes its name from Aram, one of the [[classical albedo features]] observed by [[Giovanni Schiaparelli]], who named it after the [[Biblical]] land of [[Aram (biblical region)|Aram]]. [[Spectroscopic]] observation from orbit indicates the presence of the mineral [[hematite]], likely a signature of a once aqueous environment.

Aram Chaos measures about {{convert|280|km|mi|sp=us}} across, and lies in a region called [[Margaritifer Terra]], where many water-carved channels show that floods poured out of the highlands onto the northern lowlands ages ago.  It is in the [[Oxia Palus quadrangle]].  The Thermal Emission Imaging System ([[THEMIS]]) on the [[orbiter]] ''[[Mars Odyssey]]'' found [[gray crystalline hematite]] on the floor of Aram. CRISM, the spectroscope on the [[Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter|MRO]], found hydrated sulfates, [[jarosite]], and hematite.&lt;ref&gt;Murchie, S. et al.  2009.  A synthesis of Martian aqueous mineralogy after 1 Mars year of observations from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter.  Journal of Geophysical Research: 114.&lt;/ref&gt;  Hematite is an [[iron-oxide]] [[mineral]] that can precipitate when ground water circulates through iron-rich rocks, whether at normal temperatures or in hot springs.  The floor of Aram contains huge blocks of collapsed, or chaotic, terrain that formed when water or ice was catastrophically removed. Elsewhere on Mars, the release of groundwater produced massive floods that eroded the large channels seen in Ares Vallis and similar outflow valleys. In Aram Chaos, however, the released water stayed mostly within the crater's ramparts, eroding only a small, shallow outlet channel in the eastern wall. Several minerals including hematite sulfate minerals, and water-altered silicates in Aram suggests that a lake probably once existed within the crater.  Because forming hematite requires liquid water, which could not long exist without a thick atmosphere, Mars must have had a much thicker atmosphere at some time in the past.&lt;ref&gt;

'''Babakin''' is a crater in the northeast of [[Thaumasia quadrangle]] of Mars, located in the northeast of [[Aonia Terra]] located southwest of [[Bosporos Planum]] and further southeast of Coracis Fossae. The crater is  located at 36°S latitude and 71.44°W longitude.  It is 76.66&amp;nbsp;km in diameter and was named after [[Georgy Babakin|Babakin]]. Its name was approved in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=Gazetteer of Planetary Nomenclature (USGS)|title=Babakin|url=http://planetarynames.wr.usgs.gov/Feature/532|publisher=[[International Astronomical Union]]|accessdate=June 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

East is the tiny crater Kumak and further west are Pulawy and the much smaller Los, both located at Coracis Fossae.

In the mid-northeast portion inside the crater is a smaller crater named '''Gari''', it is named for a [[Gari, Russia|town in Russia]].

'''Balch''' is a [[list of craters on Venus|crater on Venus]] at latitude 29.9, longitude 282.9 in Devana Chasma, Central Beta Regio. It is 40&amp;nbsp;km in diameter and named after [[Emily Balch]], though it was originally designated Somerville crater. This crater is one of the few examples of tectonically modified craters seen on Venus. The absence of such craters indicates a possible cessation of tectonic deformation on Venus at some point in history.

The '''Banff International Research Station (BIRS) for Mathematical Innovation and Discovery''' was established in 2003.&lt;ref name="NSERC"&gt;{{cite web|title=NSERC Grant Details|url=http://www.outil.ost.uqam.ca/CRSNG/Detail.aspx?Cle=483160&amp;Langue=2|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130628065127/http://www.outil.ost.uqam.ca/CRSNG/Detail.aspx?Cle=483160&amp;Langue=2|dead-url=yes|archive-date=28 June 2013|publisher=Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada|accessdate=22 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It provides an independent research institute for the mathematical sciences in North America, a counterpart to the [[Mathematical Research Institute of Oberwolfach]] in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World renowned mathematicians to visit Banff, study ‘Whitney problems’|url=https://www.ucalgary.ca/news/utoday/april11-2013/world-renowned-mathematicians-to-visit|publisher=University of Calgary|accessdate=19 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The research station, commonly known by its acronym, "BIRS", hosts over 2000 international scientists each year to undertake research collaboration in the [[mathematical sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Banff math centre gets $10M from NAFTA partners|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/story/2010/09/27/banff-math-centre.html|publisher=CBC News|accessdate=19 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research activities ==

The research that takes place at the Banff International Research Station is either in [[pure mathematics]], [[applied mathematics]], or in other areas of science where they [[Mathematical sciences|intersect with mathematics]].

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"BIRS embraces all aspects of the [[Mathematical sciences|mathematical]], [[Computational science|computational]] and [[Statistical sciences|statistical]] sciences from the most fundamental challenges of [[Pure mathematics|pure]] and [[applied mathematics]], [[Theoretical computer science|theoretical]] and [[Computer science#Applied computer science|applied computer science]], [[statistics]], and [[mathematical physics]], to [[Financial mathematics|financial]] and [[industrial mathematics]], as well as the mathematics of [[information technology]], and the [[life sciences]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Message from the Director|url=http://www.birs.ca/about/Message-from-director|publisher=BIRS Website|accessdate=19 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

There are a [https://scholar.google.ca/scholar?start=0&amp;q=Banff+International+Research+Station&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0,5 wide range of research publications] citing lectures, meetings and reports from BIRS.

== Research program ==

The Banff International Research Station hosts [http://www.birs.ca/programs/general-program-descriptions five types of meetings]:

# ''5-Day Workshops'': These make up the core program at BIRS, with up to 42 participants per workshop, 48 weeks per year. Some workshops have only 21 participants, and they share a week at BIRS, running concurrently.
# ''2-Day Workshops'': Weekend workshops, typically consisting of 25 people, and typically from the surrounding areas in [[Alberta]] and [[British Columbia]].
# ''Focused Research Groups'':  Up to 8 people from different institutions meet for 1–2 weeks, to work on a specific problem or finish up major projects.
# ''Research in Teams'':  2–4 people from different institutions meet for 1–2 weeks to concentrate on their research.
# ''Summer Schools and Training Camps'': instructional meetings for up to 40 students for up to 14 days.

The [http://www.birs.ca/events/2013/5-day-workshops core program of 5-day workshops] is created two years in advance. Every summer, BIRS issues a [http://www.birs.ca/announcements/2012-06-15/call-for-proposals-2014 Call for Proposals], soliciting applications for workshops from the global scientific community. Each year, it gets more competitive to get a space in the 48 available weeks at BIRS: 79 proposals were received for the 2003 program, and 168 were received for the 2014 program.&lt;ref name=2014Program&gt;{{cite web|title=The 2014 Scientific Program Announcement|url=http://www.birs.ca/announcements/2013-02-08/2014-scientific-program|publisher=BIRS Website|accessdate=23 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; An extensive peer-review process by international experts culminates in the selection of the scientific program for a given year.&lt;ref name=2014Program /&gt;&lt;ref name=REVIEW&gt;{{cite web|title=The Review Process: Ensuring High Calibre Research|url=http://www.birs.ca/about/governance/scientific-management/review-process|publisher=BIRS Website|accessdate=23 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Summer schools and training camps must apply through the same process as 5-day workshops. An example of a summer school is the [http://www.birs.ca/events/2012/summer-schools/12ss012 International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) training camp], to prepare high school students for competing at the [http://www.imo-official.org/ IMO]. The other types of meetings are far less competitive, and may be applied for at any time, through the [https://www.birs.ca/proposals/ BIRS website].

== Meeting facilities ==

The Banff International Research Station occupies two buildings on the campus of the [[Banff Centre]], in [[Banff National Park]]. One of the buildings, Corbett Hall, is a residence building that provides bedrooms, a common lounge area, a small library, and space for small teams of people to work. The other building, TransCanada PipeLines Pavilion, hosts administrative offices, two lecture rooms, and a series of smaller rooms for break-out sessions and research teams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Description of Facilities|url=http://www.birs.ca/facilities/description-of-facilities|publisher=BIRS Website|accessdate=19 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As part of the Banff Centre campus, BIRS researchers have full access to all of its [http://www.banffcentre.ca/conferences/ amenities and services].

The idea behind this choice of location for a research facility is to create an atmosphere where scientists can remove themselves from day-to-day life, and immerse themselves in their research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Klarreich|first=Erica|journal=Nature|date=30 August 2001|issue=412|page=846|title=...as mathematicians beat retreat to Alberta|doi=10.1038/35091220|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v412/n6850/full/412846c0.html|accessdate=22 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Automated lecture capture ==

In 2012, the Banff International Research Station installed a fully automated [[lecture capture]] system.&lt;ref name=AVR&gt;{{cite web|title=Automated Video Recording|url=http://www.birs.ca/facilities/automated-video |publisher=BIRS Website|accessdate=23 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It provides [[Streaming media|live video streaming]] and [[video recording]] of the lectures that take place in its main lecture room. Video recordings are automatically posted on the [http://www.birs.ca/videos/ BIRS website] within a few minutes after a lecture ends. Use of the system is opt-in, decided by the individual lecturers at the time of their lecture, via a [[touchscreen]] panel in the lecture room. The automated system at BIRS employs high quality cameras to ensure that mathematics written on chalkboards can be seen clearly. Embedded [[microphones]] and [[Audio signal processing|audio processing systems]] capture both the lecturer and questions from the audience.

Recent research videos recorded at BIRS are also available in the [https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/banff-international-research/id307566214 iTunes podcast directory].

== Funding ==
The Banff International Research Station is funded by four governments:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3324">'''Branded asset management''' refers to the implementation of [[brand]] modifications and [[Product lifecycle management|life-cycle management]] of branded assets. The branded assets category includes managing digital brand execution.

==Background==
{{Tone|section|date=October 2008}}
[[Brand management|Branding]] emerged as a top management priority in the last decade due to the growing realization that a brand is one of the most valuable assets that firms can have. A brand is more than just a name on a stationery, clothes, plant, or equipment.&lt;ref name="Clifton, R. 2003"&gt;Clifton, R., and Simmons, J. (2003) "Brands and branding", The Economist.&lt;/ref&gt; It carries meaning to all [[Project stakeholder|stakeholders]] and represents a set of values, promises, even a personality of its own.&lt;ref name="Clifton, R. 2000"&gt;Clifton, R., and Maughan, E. (2000) "Twenty five visions: the future of brands", New York University press.&lt;/ref&gt; Most companies with the biggest increases in brand value operate as single brands all over the world. 

The goal of many corporations today is to create consistency and impact, both of which are a lot easier to manage with the concept of a global brand  that offers a single worldwide identity. Branding and brand management strategies are efficient approaches as they can be employed globally. However, [[global marketing]] and increased competition have added pressure to the brand management structure. Today's marketplace is cluttered with hundreds of brands that strive to seize the attention of [[consumers]].

==Importance of re-branding==
{{Howto|section|date=September 2009}}
The effects of global marketing and increased [[Competition (economics)|competition]] have added pressure to the brand management structure. The marketplace is cluttered with hundreds of brands often competing with each other to seize the attention of consumers.
* Increased competition: as competition intensifies across all business categories, we see an increasing number of companies reviving their brands to stand out from the competition and capture a larger [[market share|share of the market]]. Branding has been seen as a way of building a strong [[reputation]].&lt;ref&gt;Davis, S.M. (2000) "Brand Asset Managemement: driving profitable growth through your brand", Jossey-bass WILEY&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Mergers &amp; acquisitions|Mergers, Acquisitions]] and [[Takeovers]]: In a [[global economy]] subject to changing market dynamics, the role of brands has never been greater. The global marketplace has attracted the activity of mergers and acquisitions. Following such an activity companies are likely to re-brand to reflect the new brand name, and this will have to be modified on all branded assets (internal, external signage, [[Point of sale|point of sal]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;e material) that carry the brand in the retail environment. Examples of major M&amp;A include [[ArcelorMittal]], and [[Daimler Chrysler|Daimler-Chrysler]].&lt;ref name="Clifton, R. 2003" /&gt;
* [[Return on investment|Return on Investment]]: Companies often revive their brands to keep it with target customer needs and expectations and combat competitive threats.&lt;ref name="Clifton, R. 2000"/&gt;

'''Bunkering''' is the supplying of fuel for use by ships,&lt;ref name="Mana"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Manaadiar|first1=Hariesh|title=What is Bunker and Bunkering|url=http://shippingandfreightresource.com/what-is-bunker-and-bunkering/|website=Shipping and Freight Resource.|publisher=Puthan House|access-date=27 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and includes the shipboard logistics of loading fuel and distributing it among available bunker tanks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=MOHIT|title=Bunkering is Dangerous : Procedure for Bunkering Operation on a Ship|url=http://www.marineinsight.com/tech/proceduresmaintenance/bunkering-is-dangerous-procedure-for-bunkering-operation-on-a-ship/|publisher=Marine Insight|date=19 October 2010|access-date=16 January 2015|postscript=  Site seems to require enabling of [[HTTP cookie|cookies]].}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term originated in the days of [[steamship]]s, when the fuel, [[coal]], was stored in bunkers.&lt;ref name="Mana"/&gt; Nowadays the term bunker is generally applied to the storage of [[petroleum]] products in [[Storage tank|tanks]], and the practice and business of refueling ships.  Bunkering operations are located at [[port|seaports]], and they include the storage of "bunker" (ship) fuels and the provision of the fuel to vessels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bunkering|url=http://www.mpa.gov.sg/sites/port_and_shipping/port/bunkering/bunkering.page|publisher=Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA)|access-date=16 January 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150107064443/http://www.mpa.gov.sg/sites/port_and_shipping/port/bunkering/bunkering.page|archivedate=7 January 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bunkering in maritime law== 
{{Main|Admiralty law}}
In many maritime contracts, such as [[charterparty|charterparties]], [[Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1971|contracts for carriage of goods by sea]],&lt;ref&gt; See the United States' [[Harter Act]]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[marine insurance|marine insurance policies]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Marine Insurance Act 1906]]&lt;/ref&gt; the shipowner or ship operator is required to ensure that the ship is [[Seakeeping|"seaworthy"]]. Seaworthiness requires not only that the ship is sound and properly crewed, but also that it is fully fuelled (or "bunkered") at the start of the voyage.&lt;ref&gt; The [[Hague–Visby Rules]] Articles II &amp; III&lt;/ref&gt; If the ship operator wishes to bunker ''en route'', this must be provided for in a written agreement, or the interruption of the voyage may be deemed to be [[Deviation (law)|deviation]] (a serious breach of contract). If the vessel runs out of fuel in mid-ocean, this is also serious breach, allowing the insurer to cancel a policy,&lt;ref&gt; ''Greenock Steamship Co  v Marine Insurance''  [1903] 2 K.B. 657&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;If the policy has a "held-covered" clause, the deviation will not allow immediate cancellation&lt;/ref&gt; and allowing a consignee to make a cargo claim. It may also give rise to a [[Marine salvage|salvage]] situation.

=="Bunkering" as theft==
Particularly in [[Petroleum industry in Nigeria|Nigeria]], "bunkering" also means the clandestine siphoning off or diverting of oil from pipelines and storage facilities. Such bunkering is often performed crudely, causing both accidents and pollution.

'''CAD Standards''' are a set of guidelines for the way [[Computer-aided drafting]] (CAD), or (CADD) Computer Aided Design and Drawing, drawings should appear, to improve productivity and interchange of CAD documents between different offices and CAD programs, especially in architecture and engineering.

==AEC (Architecture Engineering and Construction) standards==

===CAD layer standards===
Most common:

*''[[BS 1192]]'', which relies heavily on the [[Construction Project Information Committee#Code of Procedure for the Construction Industry|Code of Procedure for the Construction Industry]]
*''AIA Cad Layer Guidelines'', 2nd edition (1997), has a great usage in the USA;
*''[[ISO 13567]]-1/3'', International standard, common in Northern Europe;
*''[http://aecuk.wordpress.com/ AEC (UK)]'', an adaptation of BS-1192 based on Uniclass.
*''A/E/C CAD Standard, Tri-service (USACE/Air Force/NAVFAC) CAD standard created/maintained by the CAD/BIM Technology Center for Facilities, Infrastructure, and Environment..]&lt;ref&gt;[https://cadbim.usace.army.mil/CAD A/E/C CADD Standard R4.0] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090109024036/https://cadbim.usace.army.mil/CAD# |date=9 January 2009 }} July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''SIA 2014'' (1996), Swiss standard for engineers and architects, based on ISO 13567.
*''ÖNORM A 6240-4'' (2012), Austrian standard for digital documentation in technical drawings, based on ISO 13567.
Samples of standardised layers:
:A-B374--E- (ISO13567: agent Architect, element Roof window in SfB, presentation graphic element);
:A-37420-T2N01B113B23pro (ISO13567: agent Architect, element Roof Window in SfB, presentation Text#2, New part, floor 01, block B1, phase 1, projection 3D, scale 1:5(B), work package 23 and user definition "pro");
:A-G25---D-R (ISO13567: agent Architect, element wall in Uniclass, presentation dimensions, status Existing to be removed);
:A-G251-G-WallExtl-Fwd (AEC(UK): agent Architect, element External Wall in Uniclass, presentation graphic element, user definition "WallExtl" and view Forward);
:A210_M_ExtWall (BS1192: agent Architect, element External Wall in SfB, presentation model, user definition "ExtWall");
:A-E04---E- (ISO13567 SIA 2014: agent Architect, element Stair in SIA classification, presentation graphic element);
:A-WALL-FULL (AIA: agent Architect, element Wall, Full height).

===Line-thickness===
Thickness for pens and plot: ''0,13&amp;nbsp;mm Gray, 0,18&amp;nbsp;mm Red, 0,25&amp;nbsp;mm White, 0,35&amp;nbsp;mm Yellow, 0,50&amp;nbsp;mm Magenta, 0,70&amp;nbsp;mm Blue, 1,00&amp;nbsp;mm Green''. In [[AutoCAD]] usually parts to be printed in black are drawn in 1 to 7 basic colors. Color layer: Green-Center, Magenta-Measure of length and Blue-Hidden.

==Mechanical CAD standards==

===Model-based definition===
{{main|Model-based definition}}
[[Model-based definition|Model-based definition (MBD)]] is a method of product specification using elements within 3D models as defined by [[ASME Y14.41-2012]].  ASME Y14.41-2012 is based upon [[ASME Y14.5-2009]] symbols and definition methods, such as Geometry Dimensioning and Tolerancing (GD&amp;T).

Subscribers of [[International Organization for Standardization|International Organization for Standardization (ISO)]] have the standards ISO 1101 and ISO 16792 for model-based definition.

===Geometry quality===
[[VDA-FS|VDA]] 4955

==Product Data Quality==
PDQ is a field of [[Product Lifecycle Management|PLM]] relating to the quality of product data, particularly the geometrical and organizational quality of CAD data. Checkers, software that analyze CAD data formats, are often employed before and after [[CAD data exchange|data translation]].

'''Christian Christiansen''' (9 October 1843 in [[Lønborg]], [[Denmark]] – 28 November 1917 [[Frederiksberg]]) was a Danish physicist.

Christiansen first taught at the local polytechnical school. In 1886, he was appointed to a chair for physics at the [[University of Copenhagen]].

He mainly studied [[radiant heat]] and [[dispersion (optics)|optical dispersion]], discovering the [[Christiansen effect]] (Christiansen filter). Around 1917, he discovered the [[anomalous dispersion]] of numerous dyes, including [[Fuchsine|aniline red]] (fuchsine), by recording [[absorption spectrum|absorption spectra]].

In 1884, he confirmed the [[Stefan–Boltzmann law]].

Christiansen was elected a member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]] in 1902.

He was doctoral advisor to [[Niels Bohr]]. In 1912, he retired and [[Martin Knudsen]] became professor.

In [[general relativity]], the  '''gravitoelectric tensor''' or '''[[tidal tensor]]''' is one of the pieces in the [[Bel decomposition]] of the [[Riemann tensor]].   It is physically interpreted as giving the tidal stresses on small bits of a material object (which may also be acted upon by other physical forces), or the tidal accelerations of a small cloud of [[test particle]]s in a [[vacuum solution]] or [[electrovacuum solution]].

'''''Encyclopedia of Conifers. A Comprehensive Guide to Conifer Cultivars and Species'''''  is an encyclopedia written by Aris G. Auders and Derek P. Spicer, published in 2012. The two-volume, extensively illustrated encyclopedia is a complete reference book covering all recognised conifer cultivars and species, both hardy and tropical.  The 1,500-page work features names, synonyms, and brief descriptions, as well as information about height and spread after 10 years, where known, for over 8,000 cultivars and all 615 conifer species, plus their subspecies and varieties. Apart from the descriptive text, it is illustrated with more than 5,000 photographs, which have been taken especially for this encyclopedia.

== Publication history ==
The Encyclopedia of Conifers was written by Aris G. Auders, a conifer collector and photographer from Latvia, and Derek P. Spicer, Chairman of the British Conifer Society. The authors have been assisted by Lawrie Springate, [[Royal Horticultural Society|RHS]] International Conifer Cultivar Registrar (2004–2009) and Victoria Matthews, RHS International Registrar. The publisher is Kingsblue Publishing Limited.

==Illustration and design ==
Photography by the authors shows the general appearance of the plants, and in many cases detail special features. Many were photographed in summer and winter to show colour and texture changes through the seasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.conifer-encyclopedia.co.uk/foreward.html |title=Book Preview: Encyclopedia of Conifers. |accessdate=2011-09-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Euroclydon''' (or in Latin: '''Euroaquilo''') is a cyclonic tempestuous northeast wind which blows in the [[Mediterranean]], mostly in autumn and winter. It is the modern Gregalia ([[Gregale]]) or [[Viento de Levante|Levanter]].  From the Greek word ''eurokludōn'' [εὐροκλύδων], from ''Euros'' (Eurus, meaning east wind) and either the Greek word ''akulōn'' (akylōn, meaning north wind), or ''kludon'' (meaning a surging wave from the verb ''kluzo'' meaning to billow) or the Latin word ''aquilō'' (aquilon).

'''Felipe Mendez''' was born around 1897 in [[San Juan, Argentina]] and participated as a paleontological collector at the ''[[Captain Marshall Field Expeditions#The 2nd Captain Marshall Field Paleontological Expedition|2nd Captain Marshall Field Paleontological Expedition]]'' in 1926.

Participants of this international team were [[Elmer S. Riggs]] (Leader and Photographer), [[Robert C. Thorne]] (Collector) and [[Rudolf Stahlecker]] (Collector). The expedition started in April 1926 and finished in November 1926. The purpose was geology fossil collecting in Catamarca, Argentina. The expedition was very successful, and even new species like [[Stahleckeria]] have been found during this collaboration.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.flickr.com/photos/field_museum_library/3525670823/in/photostream/ Information by The Field Museum Library]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Judy Wajcman]], the concept of technology has historically been bound to indigenous women.  The roles of harvesters, or caretakers of the domestic economy taken up by these women lead Wajcman to conclude they would have created tools such as the [[sickle]] and the [[pestle]], making them the first technologists.&lt;ref name= wajcman&gt;Judy Wajcman, TechnoFeminism, 1st ed. (Cambridge: Polity, 2004). {{ISBN|0745630448}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|15}} During the Eighteenth century, industrial engineering began to constitute the modern definition of technology. This transformed the meaning from including useful arts technology – such as [[needlework]], [[metalwork]], [[weaving]], and [[mining]] – to strictly applied science.&lt;ref name= wajcman/&gt;{{rp|16}}  As a result, "male machines" replaced the "female fabrics" as identifiers of modern technology when engineering was considered as masculine profession.&lt;ref name= wajcman/&gt;{{rp|16}} Due to political movements of the 1960s and early 70s, science and technology were considered for a profit industrial, governmental, or militaristic based practice, and associated with masculinity resulting in a lack of feminist discourse.&lt;ref name = weber398&gt;{{Cite book | last=Weber|first=Jutta| title = From Science and Technology to Feminist Technoscience | year = 2006 | url = https://www.uni-bielefeld.de/ZIF/FG/2006Application/PDF/Weber_essay.pdf |isbn = 9780761943907|pages=398 |journal=Handbook of Gender and Women's Studies| publisher=Davis K, Evans M, Lorber J| ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feminist scholarship identified the absence of women's presence in technological and scientific spheres, due the use of sex stereotyping in education and sexual discrimination in the workforce, as well as the development of technology as a masculine construct.&lt;ref name= wajcman/&gt;{{rp|16}}  Examples of masculine-coded technologies under these categories included [[ARPANET]], a precursor to the internet developed by the United States Department of Defence, and the [[Manhattan Project]].

The women's health movements of the 1970s US and UK provided momentum to the emergence of feminist politics around scientific knowledge. During the early states of [[second-wave feminism]], campaigns for improved birth control and abortion rights were at the forefront in challenging the consolidation of male dominated sciences and technologies at the expense of women's health.  The act of regaining knowledge and control over women's bodies was seen as a crucial component to women's liberation.&lt;ref name= wajcman/&gt;{{rp|17}}

Science was originally seen as an alien entity opposed to women's interests. Sciences and technologies developed under the misconception that women's needs were universal and inferior to the needs of men, forcing women into rigid, determined sex roles.&lt;ref name= wajcman/&gt;{{rp|18}} A shift happened in the 1980s – [[Sandra Harding]] proposed "the female question in science" to raise "the question of the science in feminism", claiming that science is involved in projects that are not only neutral and objective, but that are strongly linked to male interests.&lt;ref name= wajcman/&gt;{{rp|18}} The conceptualization of science and technology was expanded to reflect the all-pervasive ways in which technology is encountered in daily life,&lt;ref name = weber398&gt;{{Cite book | last=Weber|first=Jutta| title = From Science and Technology to Feminist Technoscience | year = 2006 | url = https://www.uni-bielefeld.de/ZIF/FG/2006Application/PDF/Weber_essay.pdf |isbn = 9780761943907|pages=398 |journal=Handbook of Gender and Women's Studies| publisher=Davis K, Evans M, Lorber J| ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; gaining attention of feminists out of concern for female positions in science and technological professions.  Rather than asking how women can be better treated within and by science, feminist critics instead chose to focus on how a science deeply involved in masculinity and masculine projects could be used for the emancipation of women.&lt;ref name= wajcman/&gt;{{rp|18}}

Today's feminist critique often uses the former demonology of technology as a point of departure to tell a story of progress from liberal to [[postmodern feminism]]. According to Judy Wajcman, both liberal and Marxist feminists failed in the analysis of science and technology, because they considered the technology as neutral and did not pay attention to the symbolic dimension of technoscience.&lt;ref name="Wajcmanp25"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wajcman|first=Judy|title=Technofeminism|pages=25–26 |year=2004|publisher=Polity|location=Cambridge, United Kingdom|isbn=0-7456-3043-X|edition=Réimpr. 2005.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Feminist technologies and technoscience studies ==

Feminist technoscience studies have become intrinsically linked with practices of [[Technoethics#Technofeminism|Technofeminism]] and the development of feminist technologies in cultural and critical vernacular.  Feminist technoscience studies explore the coded social and historical implications of science and technology on the development of society, including how identity constructs and is constructed by these technologies.  Technofeminism emerged in the early 1980s, leaning on the different feminist movements. Feminist scholars reanalyzed the [[Scientific Revolution]], and stated that the resulting science was based on the masculine ideology of exploiting the Earth and control.  During this time, nature and scientific inquiry were modelled after misogynous relationships to women.  Femininity was associated with nature and considered as something passive to be objectified. This was in contrast to culture, which was represented by objectifying masculinity.  This analysis depended on the use of gender imagery to conceptualize the nature of technoscientific masculine ideology.&lt;ref name= wajcman/&gt;{{rp|85}}

Judy Wajcman draws parallels between [[Judith Butler]]'s theory of gender performativity and the construction of technology.  Butler conceives gender as a performative act as opposed to a naturalized condition one is born into.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Performative Acts and Gender Constitution: An Essay in Phenomenology and Feminist Theory |first=Judith |last=Butler |doi=10.2307/3207893|journal= Theatre Journal 40, no. 4 |pages= 519–31 |date=1988 |volume=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Through a fluctuating process achieved in daily social interaction, gender identity is acted and constructed through relational behaviours – it is a fluid concept. Drawing from the work of Butler and [[Donna Haraway]], Amade M'charek analyzes how objects, when linked to another object or signifier, construct identity through the use of human imagination:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Differences and similarities may be stable or not, depending on the maintenance work that goes into the relations that help to produce them. They are neither fundaments nor qualities that are always embodied… Differences are relational. They do not always materialize in bodies (in the flesh, genes, hormones, brains, or the skin). Rather they materialize in the very relations that help to enact them.&lt;ref name = Amade&gt;{{cite journal |title= Fragile Differences, Relational Effects: Stories about the Materiality of Race and Sex |first=Amade |last=M'charek |doi=10.1177/1350506810377698|journal=European Journal of Women's Studies |page= 313 |volume=17 |year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

In this theory, identity is not the byproduct of genes, but the constant upholding of hierarchical difference relations.&lt;ref name = Amade&gt;{{cite journal |title= Fragile Differences, Relational Effects: Stories about the Materiality of Race and Sex |first=Amade |last=M'charek |doi=10.1177/1350506810377698|journal=European Journal of Women's Studies |page= 313 |volume=17 |year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Differences in identity are the effect of interferences, performing and enacting and being enacted upon.  Technology too, as proposed by Wajcman, is a product of mutual alliances, not objectively given but collectively created in a process of reiteration.  To this end, technology exists as both a source and a concurrence of identity relations.

Western technology and science is deeply implicated in the masculine projection and patriarchal domination of women and nature.&lt;ref name= wajcman/&gt;{{rp|85}}   After the shift of feminist theory to focus more on technoscience, there was a call for new technology to be based on the needs and values of women, rather than masculine dominated technological development.  The differences between female and male needs were asserted by feminist movements, drawing attention to the exclusion of women being served by current technologies.&lt;ref name= wajcman/&gt;{{rp|22}}  Reproductive technologies in particular were influenced by this movement. During this time, household technologies, new media, and new technosciences were, for the most part, disregarded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-first=Kathy|editor-last=Davis|title=Handbook of gender and women's studies|year=2006|publisher=Sage|location=London [u.a.]|isbn=9780761943907|edition=1. publ.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Feminist technologies===

[[Feminist]] technologies are ones that are formed from feminist social relations, but varied definitions and layers of feminism complicate the definition.  Deborah Johnson&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Johnson|first=Deborah G.|title=Sorting out the question of feminist technology|journal=Feminist technology|year=2010|page=6|url=http://www.nyu.edu/projects/nissenbaum/papers/Sorting%20out%20the%20Question%20of%20Feminist%20Technology.pdf|accessdate=30 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; proposes four candidates for feminist technologies: 
* Technologies that are good for women
* Technologies that constitute gender-equitable social relations
* Technologies that favor women
* Technologies that constitute social relations that are more equitable than those that were constituted by a prior technology or than those that prevail in the wider society

The successes of certain technologies, such as the [[pap smear]] for cervical cancer testing, relied on the feminization of technician jobs.  The intervention of women outside the technological sphere, like from members of the women's health movement, and public health activists also aided in the tool's development.&lt;ref&gt;Judy Wajcman, TechnoFeminism, 1st ed. (Cambridge: Polity, 2004), 48.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, other feminist technologies, such as birth control serve as an example of a feminist technology also shaped in part by dominant masculinity.

[[Combined oral contraceptive pills]] were first approved for use in the United States in 1960, during the time of the women's liberation movement. The birth control pill helped make it possible for more women to enter the workforce by giving them the ability to control her own fertility.  Decades prior to this, activists such as [[Margaret Sanger]] and [[Katharine McCormick]] fought for female contraceptives, seeing it as a necessity for the emancipation of women.&lt;ref&gt;"People &amp; Events: The Pill and the Women's Liberation Movement." PBS. Accessed December 04, 2016. https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/pill/peopleevents/e_lib.html.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, in the 1970s feminists raised critique on male control of the medical and [[pharmaceutical industry]].  The male domination of these fields led technologies such as oral contraceptives to be developed around what men considered to be universal, defining characteristics of women (these being their sex and reproductive capabilities).&lt;ref name=Wajcman50&gt;Judy Wajcman, TechnoFeminism, 1st ed. (Cambridge: Polity, 2004), 50.&lt;/ref&gt;  Birth control pills themselves also succeeded in perpetrating and creating this universality – shaped by moral considerations of the natural body, the length of the menstrual cycle was able to be engineered.&lt;ref name=Wajcman50&gt;Judy Wajcman, TechnoFeminism, 1st ed. (Cambridge: Polity, 2004), 50.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bioethics and capitalism ===

The development of reproductive technologies blur the lines between nature and technology, allowing for the reconfiguration of life itself. Through the advances of genetic technologies, the controlling of pregnancy, childbirth, and motherhood has become increasingly possible through intrusive means.  These advances in [[biotechnology]] are serving to develop life as a commodity and deepen monetary inequality - a link made by feminist theorists such as Donna Haraway.&lt;ref name = weber399&gt;{{Cite book | last=Weber|first=Jutta| title = From Science and Technology to Feminist Technoscience |  year = 2006 | url = https://www.uni-bielefeld.de/ZIF/FG/2006Application/PDF/Weber_essay.pdf |isbn = 9780761943907|pages=399|journal=Handbook of Gender and Women's Studies| publisher=Davis K, Evans M, Lorber J| ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Genetic engineering also brings about questions in eugenics, leading to early radical feminist analysis to declare and attempt to reclaim motherhood as a foundation of female identity.&lt;ref name= wajcman/&gt;{{rp|79}} The idea of a green, natural motherhood was popularized by [[Ecofeminism#ecofeminism|eco feminists]] who celebrated the identification of women with nature, and natural life.&lt;ref name= wajcman/&gt;{{rp|79}}

Haraway instead chooses to embrace technology as feminist instead of reverting to this idea of naturalized femininity. By embracing the image of the [[cyborg]],  an amalgamation that is neither human/animal nor machine, Haraway explores the ideas of technoscience and gender, conceptualizing a space where gender is an arbitrary, unnecessary construct.&lt;ref name= wajcman/&gt;{{rp|80}}

The corporatization of biology through the alteration of nature through technology is also a theme explored by Haraway. The [[oncomouse#oncomouse|OncoMouse]] is a laboratory mouse genetically modified to carry a specific gene which increases the creature's chance of developing cancer.  Until 2005, American conglomerate DuPoint owned the patent to the OncoMouse, reconfiguring and relegating life to a commodity.&lt;ref name= wajcman/&gt;{{rp|89}} This development in genetic engineering brings up questions about lab animal treatment, as well as ethical questions around class and race. Increasing [[breast cancer]] rates in Black women are discussed in [[eco-feminist]] analysis of the modification of lab animals from breast cancer research to being the discussion into an ethically ambiguous space.  Haraway in particular raises the question of whether modifying and expending a live commodity like OncoMouse is ethical if it leads to the development of a cure for breast cancer.&lt;ref name= wajcman/&gt;{{rp|91}}

The reconfiguring of life in biotechnologies and genetic engineering allow for a precedence to be set, leading to capitalist cultural consequences.  Through these technologies technoscience becomes naturalized, and also becomes increasingly subject to the process of commodification and capital accumulation in transnational capitalist corporations.&lt;ref name= wajcman/&gt;{{rp|89}} Like presented in [[Marxist]] and [[Neo-Marxist]] analysis of sciences, biotechnologies allow for the concept of commodity to become fetishized as genes are reified to have a monetary value outside nature.  This also develops life and nature as a thing to be exploited by capitalism.&lt;ref name= wajcman/&gt;{{rp|90}}

'''George Robbins Gliddon''' (1809 – November 16, 1857) was an English-born American [[Egyptologist]]. 

==Biography==
[[File:Races and skulls.png|upright|thumb|Drawings from [[Josiah C. Nott]] and George Gliddon's ''Indigenous races of the earth'' (1857), which promoted scientific racism with the suggestion that [[black people]] ranked between [[white people]] and chimpanzees in terms of intelligence.]]
He was born in [[Devon]]shire, England. His father, a merchant, was United States consul at [[Alexandria]] where Gliddon was taken at an early age.&lt;ref&gt;The Gliddons and the Beginning of American-Egyptian Relations: Chapter 8, pp.95-111 of Cassandra Vivian (2012) Americans in Egypt&lt;/ref&gt; 

Gliddon became United States vice-consul and took a great interest in [[Egypt]]ian antiquities. Subsequently, he lectured in the United States and succeeded in attracting attention to the subject of [[Egyptology]]. His chief work was ''Ancient Egypt'' (1850, ed. 1853). He wrote also ''Memoir on the Cotton of Egypt'' (1841);&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/amemoironcotton00glidgoog Memoir on the Cotton of Egypt (London, 1841)].&lt;/ref&gt; ''Appeal to the Antiquaries of Europe on the Destruction of the Monuments of Egypt'' (1841); ''Discourses on Egyptian Archaeology'' (1849);&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/bub_gb_Sn1JAAAAMAAJ#page/n15/mode/2up Otia Aegytpiaca: Discourses on Egyptian Archaeology (London, 1849)]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Types of Mankind'' (1854), in conjunction with [[Josiah Nott|J. C. Nott]]; and ''Indigenous Races of the Earth'' (1857), also in conjunction with Nott and others.

Gliddon was influenced by [[Samuel George Morton]]'s [[craniometry]] and [[polygenist]] theory of human origins. Morton collected hundreds of human skulls from around the world and tried to classify them. Morton claimed that he could judge the intellectual capacity of a race by the [[cranial capacity]] (the measure of the volume of the interior of the skull). In Morton's theory, a large skull meant a large brain and high intellectual capacity, and a small skull indicated a small brain and decreased intellectual capacity. By studying these skulls he claimed that the evidence supported polygenism, that each race had a separate origin. Morton had many skulls from [[Ancient Egypt]], and concluded that the ancient Egyptians were not African, but were instead [[Caucasian race|Caucasians]].

Morton's followers, particularly Gliddon and [[Josiah Nott]] in their monumental tribute to Morton's work, ''Types of Mankind'' (1854), carried Morton's ideas further and backed up Morton's findings which supported the notion of [[polygenism]], which contends that humanity originates from different lineages and is the ancestor of the [[multiregional hypothesis]].

Gliddon collaborated with Morton on several published works; they shared many views on human races. Morton had sent Gliddon over 100 Egyptian crania specimens. Gliddon was a popular lecturer and researcher on Egyptology and from his studies of ancient Egyptian monuments and hieroglyphics, he concluded that the Egyptians had been white, and that even in the ancient world there had been distinctly different races. He posited that Whites and Negroes had never changed their racial appearance and features. He believed that neither environment or climate could change a race into another. He rejected [[Monogenesis (disambiguation)|Monogenesis]], and claimed that the Bible supported Polygenisis.

The '''Hans Kilian Award''' honors researchers whose outstanding scientific achievements provide a deeper insight into the historical and cultural existence of humankind and the changing human psyche.

The award was conceived by [[:de: Lotte Köhler|Lotte Köhler]] and established by the Köhler Foundation. It bears the name of the late social psychologist and psychoanalyst [[:de: Hans Kilian|Hans Kilian]] (1921-2008) and aims to foster his idea of an interdisciplinary social psychology and psychoanalysis as well as his concept of "metacultural humanization." This concept reflects the interactions between individual life history and broader sociohistorical developments and aims to integrate social and cultural psychological, psychoanalytic, anthropological, historical, and sociological perspectives.

In line with Hans Kilian's ideas, the award recognizes international scientific achievements that cross the boundaries between disciplines and cultures and create productive syntheses between previously isolated areas of knowledge. Desirable inter- and transdisciplinary perspectives combine theories, methods, and findings from a wide spectrum of disciplines including the humanities, the social sciences, and cultural studies, as well as psychiatry and other areas of medicine. Amounting to 80,000 euros, the Hans Kilian Award is one of the best-endowed social sciences awards in Europe. It is awarded every two years and was first awarded in 2011.

The award will be a central part of the activities of the [[Hans Kilian and Lotte Köhler Center]] (KKC) for Social and Cultural Scientific Psychology and Historical Anthropology which was founded by the Köhler Foundation in August 2014 and whose office and activities are based at the Chair of Social Theory and Social Psychology, Ruhr University Bochum, Germany.

The '''International Association of Empirical Aesthetics''' ('''IAEA''') is a [[psychology|psychological]] [[organization]] founded to scientifically investigate the nature of [[aesthetic experience]] and aesthetic behavior. The group has members in over 25 countries. IAEA was founded at the first international congress in Paris in 1965 by [[Daniel Berlyne]], [[Robert Francés]], [[Carmelo Genovese]], and [[Albert Wellek]]. 

==Background==
Although IAEA has been active for half a century, the domain of experimental aesthetics is much older. It is the second-oldest branch of scientific psychology, traditionally dating from 1876, the year Gustav Theodor Fechner (1801-1887) published his ''Vorschule der Aesthetik'' (Preschool of Aesthetics). Fechner, who also is credited with founding psychophysics, established methods for examining aesthetic response to a variety of visual forms, including an exploration of the venerable Golden Section hypothesis. Since the inception of IAEA in 1965, research on empirical aesthetics has continued to progress, with many pioneers prominent in its membership: witness, for instance, such classic books such as Daniel Berlyne’s (1971) ''Aesthetics and Psychobiology'', Colin Martindale’s (1990) ''The Clockwork Muse: The Predictability of Artistic Change'', or a variety of more recent contributions from IAEA’s current members.

==Current situation==
The International Association of Empirical Aesthetics (IAEA) is an organization of researchers who use scientific methods to investigate aesthetic experience and aesthetic behavior in a wide variety of domains, including encounters with beauty, visual art, music, literature, film, theater, philosophy, and museum behavior. Our membership includes individuals from psychology, neuroscience, sociology, museology, art history, philosophy, musicology, and other domains.

Currently, the officers of IAEA are President [[Helmut Leder]] (Vienna), Secretary Stefano Mastandrea (Rome) and Treasurer Thomas Jacobsen (Hamburg). A list of former officers can be found on the IAEA webpage.

IAEA organizes bi-annual conferences. IAEA is closely associated with the journal ''[[Empirical Studies in the Arts]]''. IAEA gives several awards to recognize excellence in empirical research on aesthetics and creativity:  The [[Gustav Theodor Fechner Award]] for Outstanding Contributions to [[Empirical Aesthetics]].  The Sir Francis Galton Award for Outstanding Contribution to the Study of Creativity. The Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten Award for Outstanding Contributions of Young Scientists.

[[Image:INVIS MIRROR.png|thumb|An example of how an object could appear to be invisible through the use of mirrors]]

'''Invisibility''' is  the state of an object that cannot be [[Visual perception|seen]]. An object in this state is said to be ''invisible'' (literally, "not visible"). The term is often used in [[fantasy]]/[[science fiction]], where objects cannot be seen by [[Magic (paranormal)|magical]] or [[Technology|technological]] means; however, its effects can also be demonstrated in the real world, particularly in [[physics]] and perceptual [[psychology]] classes.

Since objects can be seen by light in the [[visible spectrum]] from a source reflecting off their surfaces and hitting the viewer's [[Human eye|eye]], the most natural form of invisibility (whether real or fictional) is an object that neither reflects nor absorbs light (that is, it allows light to pass through it). This is known as 
[[Transparency and translucency|transparency]], and is seen in many naturally occurring materials (although no naturally occurring material is 100% transparent).

Invisibility perception depends on several optical and visual factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Moreno|first1 = Ivan|last2 = Jauregui-Sánchez|first2 = Y.|last3 = Avendaño-Alejo|first3 = Maximino|year = 2014|title = Invisibility assessment: a visual perception approach|url = http://fisica.uaz.edu.mx/~imoreno/Publicaciones/JOSA2014.pdf|journal = Journal of the Optical Society of America A|volume = 31|issue = 10|pages = 2244–2248|doi = 10.1364/josaa.31.002244|bibcode = 2014JOSAA..31.2244M}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, invisibility depends on the [[Human eye|eye]]s of the observer and/or the instruments used. Thus an object can be classified as "invisible to" a person, animal, instrument, etc. In research on sensorial [[perception]] it has been shown that invisibility is perceived in cycles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Craig | first1 = Eugene A. | last2 = Lichtenstein | first2 = M. | year = 1953 | title = Visibility-Invisibility Cycles as a Function of Stimulus-Orientation | jstor=1418951 | journal = The American Journal of Psychology | volume = 66 | issue = 4| pages = 554–563 | doi=10.2307/1418951| pmid = 13124563 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Invisibility is often considered to be the supreme form of [[camouflage]], as it does not reveal to the viewer any kind of [[vital signs]], [[visual]] effects, or any  frequencies of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]] detectable to the human eye, instead making use of [[radio]], [[infrared]] or [[ultraviolet]] wavelengths.

In [[illusion optics]], invisibility is a special case of illusion effects: the illusion of free space.

== Practical efforts ==
{{prose|date=June 2016}}

Technology can be used theoretically or practically to render real-world objects invisible:
* Making use of a real-time image displayed on a wearable display, it is possible to create a see-through effect. This is known as [[active camouflage]].
* Though [[stealth technology]] is declared to be invisible to [[radar]], all officially disclosed applications of the technology can only ''reduce'' the size and/or clarity of the signature detected by radar.
* 2006: A team effort of researchers from Britain and the US announced the development of a real [[Cloak of invisibility#Cloaks of invisibility in science|cloak of invisibility]], though it is only in its first stages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/15329396/ |title=Cloak of invisibility: Fact or fiction? |website=MSNBC.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[filmmaking]], people, objects, or backgrounds can be made to look invisible on camera through a process known as [[chroma key]]ing.
*An artificially made [[meta material]] that is invisible to the microwave spectrum.

Engineers and scientists have performed various kinds of research to investigate the possibility of finding ways to create real optical invisibility (cloaks) for objects. Methods are typically based on implementing the theoretical techniques of [[transformation optics]], which have given rise to several [[theories of cloaking]].
* 2003: Chilean [[Gunther Uhlmann]] postulates first mathematical equations to create invisible materials.&lt;ref name="Alonso, 2013"&gt;{{cite web |last=Alonso |first=N. |url=http://www.quepasa.cl/articulo/ciencia/2013/03/3-11386-9-un-genio-invisible.shtml/ |title=Un genio invisible |language=es |trans-title=An invisible genius |website=Qué Pasa |date=March 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Currently, a practical cloaking device does not exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Nachman | first = Adrian I. |date=November 1988 | title = Reconstructions From Boundary Measurements | journal = Annals of Mathematics | volume = 128 | issue = 3 | pages = 531–576 | doi = 10.2307/1971435 | jstor = 1971435 | publisher = Annals of Mathematics}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Wolf | first = Emil |author2=Tarek Habashy |date=May 1993 | title = Invisible Bodies and Uniqueness of the Inverse Scattering Problem | journal = Journal of Modern Optics | volume = 40 | issue = 5 | pages = 785–792  | doi = 10.1080/09500349314550821|bibcode = 1993JMOp...40..785W }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2006 theoretical work predicts that the imperfections are minor, and [[metamaterial]]s may make real-life "cloaking devices" practical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Pendry | first = J.

The theory that light waves can be acted upon the same way as radio waves is now a popular idea among scientists. The agent can be compared to a stone in a river, around which water passes, but slightly down-stream leaves no trace of the stone. Comparing light waves to the water, and whatever object that is being "cloaked" to the stone, the goal is to have light waves pass around that object, leaving no visible aspects of it, possibly not even a shadow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Adrian | last = Cho | url = http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/summary/312/5777/1120a | title = High-Tech Materials Could Render Objects Invisible | work = Science | page = 1120 |date=2006-05-26 | accessdate = 2006-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the technique depicted in the 2000 television portrayal of [[The Invisible Man (2000 TV series)|The Invisible Man]].
* Two teams of scientists worked separately to create two "Invisibility Cloaks" from '[[metamaterials]]' engineered at the [[nanoscale]] level. They demonstrated for the first time the possibility of cloaking three-dimensional (3-D) objects with artificially engineered materials that redirect radar, light or other waves around an object. While one uses a type of fishnet of metal layers to reverse the direction of light, the other uses tiny silver wires. Xiang Zhang, of the [[University of California]], [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]] said: "In the case of invisibility cloaks or shields, the material would need to curve light waves completely around the object like a river flowing around a rock. An observer looking at the cloaked object would then see light from behind it, making it seem to disappear."
* [[UC Berkeley]] researcher Jason Valentine's team made a material that affects light near the visible spectrum, in a region used in fibre optics: 'Instead of the fish appearing to be slightly ahead of where it is in the water, it would actually appear to be above the water's surface. It's kind of weird. For a metamaterial to produce negative refraction, it must have a structural array smaller than the wavelength of the electromagnetic radiation being used." Valentine's team created their 'fishnet' material by stacking silver and metal dielectric layers on top of each other and then punching holes through them. The other team used an oxide template and grew silver nanowires inside porous aluminum oxide at tiny distances apart, smaller than the wavelength of visible light. This material refracts visible light.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-1043466/Invisibility-cloak-step-closer-scientists-bend-light-wrong-way.html | location=London | work=Daily Mail | title=Invisibility cloak a step closer as scientists bend light 'the wrong way' | date=2008-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Imperial College London]] research team achieved results with [[microwaves]]. An invisibility cloak layout of a copper cylinder was produced in May, 2008, by physicist Professor Sir [[John Pendry]]. Scientists working with him at [[Duke University]] in the US put the idea into practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.themoneytimes.com/articles/20080811/scientists_turn_fiction_into_reality_closer_to_make_objects_invisible-id-1032139.html |website=themoneytimes.com |title=Scientists Turn Fiction Into Reality, Closer to Make Objects "Invisible" |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080816035413/http://www.themoneytimes.com/articles/20080811/scientists_turn_fiction_into_reality_closer_to_make_objects_invisible-id-1032139.html |archive-date=2008-08-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/top-stories/2008/08/11/secrets-of-invisibility-discovered-115875-20692852/ |website=mirror.co.uk |title=Secrets of invisibility discovered}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Pendry, who theorized the invisibility cloak "as a joke" to illustrate the potential of metamaterials, said in an interview in August 2011 that grand, theatrical manifestations of his idea are probably overblown: "I think it’s pretty sure that any cloak that Harry Potter would recognize is not on the table. You could dream up some theory, but the very practicality of making it would be so impossible. But can you hide things from light? Yes. Can you hide things which are a few centimeters across? Yes. Is the cloak really flexible and flappy? No. Will it ever be? No. So you can do quite a lot of things, but there are limitations. There are going to be some disappointed kids around, but there might be a few people in industry who are very grateful for it."&lt;ref name="PendryVideo"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://spie.org/x57588.xml |author=John Pendry |title=video: The birth and promise of metamaterials |website=SPIE |date=18 October 2011 |doi=10.1117/2.3201110.02}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In Turkey / 2009, Bilkent University  Search Center Of Nanotechnology researches explained and published in ''[[New Journal of Physics]]'' that they achieved to make invisibility real in practice using nanotechnology making an object invisible with no shadows etc. next to perfect transparent scene by producing nanotechnologic material that can also be produced like a suit anyone can wear.

== Psychological ==

A person can be described as invisible if others refuse to see him or routinely overlook him. The term was used in this manner in the title of the book ''[[Invisible Man]]'', by [[Ralph Ellison]], in reference to the protagonist, likely modeled after the author, being overlooked on account of his status as an [[African American]]. This is supported by the quote taken from the Prologue, "I am invisible, understand, simply because people refuse to see me." (Prologue.1)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ellison |first1=Ralph |title=Invisible man |date=1947 |publisher=Modern Library/Random House |location=New York |isbn=9780679601395 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fictional use ==
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2013}}
{{main|Invisibility in fiction}}
[[File:Illustration to Richard Wagner's "Das Rheingold".jpg|thumb|upright=.85|[[Alberich]] puts on the [[Tarnhelm]] and vanishes; illustration by [[Arthur Rackham]] to [[Richard Wagner]]'s ''[[Das Rheingold]]'']]
In fiction, people or objects can be rendered completely invisible by several means:

* Magical objects such as [[Finger ring|ring]]s, [[cloak]]s and [[amulet]]s can be worn to grant the wearer permanent invisibility (or temporary invisibility until the object is taken off).
* Magical [[potion]]s can be consumed to grant temporary or permanent invisibility.
* Magic spells can be cast on people or objects, usually giving temporary invisibility.
* Some mythical [[Legendary creature|creatures]] can make themselves invisible at will, such as in some tales in which [[leprechaun]]s or [[Chinese dragon]]s can shrink so much that humans cannot see them.
* In science fiction, the idea of a "[[cloaking device]]".

In some works, the power of magic creates an effective means of invisibility by distracting anyone who might notice the character. But since the character is not truly invisible, the effect could be betrayed by mirrors or other reflective surfaces.

Where [[Magic (paranormal)|magical]] invisibility is concerned, the issue may arise of whether the [[clothing]] worn by and any items carried by the invisible being are also rendered invisible. In general they are also regarded as being invisible, but in some instances clothing remains visible and must be removed for the full invisibility effect.

[[File:NSC KIPT 04.jpg|thumb|right|200px|National Science Center, Kharkiv Institute of Physics and Technology]]
The '''National Science Center Kharkiv Institute of Physics and Technology (KIPT)''' ({{lang-uk|Національний науковий центр «Харківський фізико-технічний інститут»}}, formerly Ukrainian Institute of Physics and Technology) is the oldest and largest [[physical science]] research centre in [[Ukraine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kipt.kharkov.ua/en/bhr.html|title=History {{!}} ННЦ ХФТИ|website=www.kipt.kharkov.ua|access-date=2016-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today it is known as a [[Science museum#Science_center|science center]] as it consists of several institutes that are part of the Kharkiv Institute of Physics and Technology science complex.

==History==
[[File:ХФТИ.jpg|thumb|Group photo of the KIPT physicists in 1934]]
[[File:NSC KIPT 03.jpg|thumb|Commemoritve plaque about the nuclear fission conducted in 1932]]
The institute was founded on 30 October 1928 by the Government of Soviet Ukraine&lt;ref name=vokrugsveta&gt;Taravarov, Ya. ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20171230193505/http://www.vokrugsveta.ru/telegraph/theory/816/ Landau in a field of negative values (Ландау в области отрицательных значений)]''. Vokrug Sveta. 15 December 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; on an initiative of [[Abram Ioffe]] on the northern outskirts of [[Kharkiv]] (in khutir [[Piatykhatky, Kharkiv Oblast|Piatykhatky]]) as the '''Ukrainian Institute of Physics and Technology''' for the purpose of research on [[nuclear physics]] and [[condensed matter physics]]. Note that Kharkiv at that time was the capital of [[Soviet Ukraine]]. An opening of the institute precisely in [[Kharkiv]] had an ideological implication: At height of being defeated by the [[Russian Red Army]], the "samostiynyky"{{efn|a ridiculed name for Ukrainians in Russia}} of various modifications who laid at the basis of Ukrainian [[national consciousness]] their culture of the past, the [[Soviet Ukraine]] has implemented new culture based on advanced achievements of the human intellect and modern technologies rather than on [[sharovary]] (Ukrainian traditional dress), [[Ukrainian folk music|folk songs]], and [[oseledets]] (Ukrainian Cossack hairstyle).&lt;ref name=vokrugsveta/&gt;

From the moment of its creation, the institute was run by the [[People's Commissariat of Heavy Industry]].&lt;ref name=vokrugsveta/&gt;

On 10 October 1932 the first experiments in [[nuclear fission]] in the [[Soviet Union]] were conducted here. The Soviet nuclear physicists [[Anton Valter]], [[Georgiy Latyshev]], [[Cyril Sinelnikov]], and [[Aleksandr Leipunskii]] used a [[lithium]] atom nucleus. Later the Ukrainian Institute of Physics and Technology was able to obtain [[liquid hydrogen]] and helium. They also constructed a [[radar]] station, and the institute became a pioneer of the Soviet high [[vacuum engineering]] which was developed into an industrial [[vacuum metallurgy]].

During the Stalin epoch, this was where the [[UPTI Affair]] occurred in 1938: three leading physicists of the Kharkiv Institute ([[Lev Landau]], [[Yuri Rumer]] and Moisey Korets) were arrested by the Soviet secret police.

The Ukrainian Institute of Physics and Technology was the "Laboratory no. 1" for nuclear physics, and was responsible for the first development of a nuclear bomb in the former USSR.

{{LGBT symbols}}
{{LGBT sidebar|culture}}

The [[LGBT]] community has adopted certain [[symbols]] for [[Identity (social science)|self-identification]] to demonstrate unity, [[gay pride|pride]], shared values, and allegiance to one another. '''LGBT symbols''' communicate ideas, concepts, and identity both within their communities and to mainstream culture. The two most-recognized international LGBT symbols are the [[pink triangle]] and the [[rainbow flag (LGBT movement)|rainbow flag]]. The pink triangle, employed by the [[Nazi]]s in [[World War II]] as a badge of shame, was [[Reappropriation|re-appropriated]] but retained negative connotations. The rainbow flag,  previously used as a symbol of unity among all people, was adopted to be a more organic and natural replacement without any negativity attached to it.

==Flags==
{{Main|Pride flag}}

===Rainbow===
{{Main|Rainbow flag (LGBT movement)}}

[[Gilbert Baker (artist)|Gilbert Baker]] designed the [[Rainbow flag (LGBT movement)|rainbow]] [[Gay pride|Pride]] flag for the 1978 San Francisco Gay Freedom Celebration. The flag does not depict an actual rainbow. Rather, the colors of the rainbow are displayed as horizontal stripes, with red at the top and violet at the bottom. It represents the diversity of gays and lesbians around the world.  In the original eight-color version, pink stood for sexuality, red for life, orange for healing, yellow for the sun, green for nature, turquoise for art, indigo for harmony, and violet for spirit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://apps.carleton.edu/campus/gsc/students/ally/lgbtsymbols/ |title=Carleton College: Gender and Sexuality Center: Symbols of Pride of the LGBTQ Community |publisher=Apps.carleton.edu |date=2005-04-26 |accessdate=2012-01-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120210045929/http://apps.carleton.edu/campus/gsc/students/ally/lgbtsymbols/ |archive-date=2012-02-10 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A copy of the original 20-by-30 foot, eight-color flag was remade by Baker in 2000, and was installed in the [[Castro District, San Francisco|Castro district]] in San Francisco.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rochman|first1=Sue|title=Rainbow flap|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CGMEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA16&amp;lpg=PA16#v=onepage&amp;q=original%20pride%20flag%20flies%20in%20the%20castro |website=[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]]|page=16|date=June 20, 2000|accessdate=21 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another similar flag flies at [[Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual &amp; Transgender Community Center|The Center]] in New York City.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

===Asexuality===
{{Main|Asexuality}}
[[File:Asexual flag.svg|thumb|right|150px|alt=Black, gray, white, purple stripes|Asexual pride]]
&lt;!--Forums, chat rooms, personal blogs, and user-generated sites are not acceptable sources. See [[Wikipedia:Identifying reliable sources]] and [[WP:VERIFY]] for info.--&gt;

The asexual pride flag consists of four horizontal stripes: black, grey, white, and purple from top to bottom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bilić |first1=Bojan |last2=Kajinić |first2=Sanja |title=Intersectionality and LGBT Activist Politics: Multiple Others in Croatia and Serbia | publisher=Springer | date=2016 |pages=95–96}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Decker |first1=Julie |title=The Invisible Orientation: An Introduction to Asexuality | publisher=Skyhorse}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transexual: Symbols |url=https://www.odu.edu/life/diversity/resources/lgbtqa/symbols |publisher=Old Dominion University}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Asexual |url=http://www.lgbt.ucla.edu/Campus-Resources/Asexual |publisher=UCLA Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender Resource center}}&lt;/ref&gt; The black stripe represents asexuality, the grey stripe for the "grey area" between sexual and asexual, the white stripe for sexuality, and the purple stripe for community.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}

In August 2010, after a process of getting the word out beyond the [[Asexual Visibility and Education Network]] (AVEN) and to non-English speaking areas, a flag was chosen following a vote on a non-AVEN site.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} It had been seen alongside other sexual orientation flags previous to formal election{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} and has since been seen used in various LGBT publications and causes.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}

The AVEN logo is a triangle fading from white to black to symbolise the gradient between sexuals, [[Gray asexuality|gray-asexuals]], [[Demisexuality|demisexuals]], and asexuals.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}

The ace of spades and ace of hearts are also used as asexual symbols as "ace" is a phonetic shortening of asexual.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} Similarly, "aro" is commonly used as an abbreviation for aromantic.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} Generally, romantic asexuals use the ace of hearts as their symbol, and aromantic asexuals use the ace of spades.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}

Another common symbol for the asexual community is a black ring worn on the middle finger of their right hand. The material and exact design of the ring are not important as long as it is primarily black.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} This symbol also found its start on AVEN in 2005.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}

===Bear culture===
{{Main|Bear flag (gay culture)}}
[[File:Bear Brotherhood flag.svg|thumb|left|150px|alt=Bear Brotherhood flag|[[Bear flag (gay culture)|International Bear Brotherhood]]]]

''Bear'' is an affectionate [[gay slang]] term for those in the bear communities, a subculture in the [[gay community]] and an emerging subset of the LGBT community with its own events, codes, and culture-specific identity. Bears tend to have hairy bodies and [[facial hair]]; some are [[overweight|heavy-set]]; some project an image of working-class [[masculinity]] in their [[Personal grooming|grooming]] and appearance, though none of these are requirements or unique indicators. The bear concept can function as an identity, an affiliation, and an ideal to live up to. There is ongoing debate in bear communities about what constitutes a bear. Some state that self-identifying as a bear is the only requirement, while others argue that bears must have certain physical characteristics, such as a hairy chest and face, a large body, or a certain mode of dress and behavior.

Bears are almost always [[gay]] or [[bisexuality|bisexual]] men; [[transgender]] men (regardless of their sexuality) and those who shun labels for [[gender]] and [[Sexual identity|sexuality]] are increasingly included within bear communities. The bear community has spread all over the world, with bear clubs in many countries. Bear clubs often serve as social and sexual networks for older, hairier, sometimes heavier gay and bisexual men, and members often contribute to their local gay communities through fundraising and other functions. Bear events are common in heavily gay communities.

The [[Bear flag (gay culture)|International Bear Brotherhood Flag]] was designed in 1995 by Craig Byrnes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bearmfg.com/history/history.html |title=Flag History |publisher=Bearmfg.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120211094128/http://www.bearmfg.com/history/history.html |archive-date=2012-02-11 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bisexuality===
{{Main|Bisexual pride flag}}
[[File:Bi flag.svg|thumb|right|150px|Bisexual pride|alt=Magenta, lavender, and blue stripes]]

First unveiled on 5 December 1998,&lt;ref name="biflag"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biflag.com/Activism.asp |title=History, Bi Activism, Free Graphics |publisher=BiFlag.com |date=1998-12-05 |accessdate=2012-01-23 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204070907/http://www.biflag.com/Activism.asp | archive-date=2012-02-04 | deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[bisexual pride flag]] was designed by Michael Page to represent and increase visibility of bisexuals in the LGBT community and society as a whole. This rectangular flag consists of a broad magenta stripe at the top, a broad stripe in blue at the bottom, and a narrower deep lavender band occupying the central fifth.

Page describes the meaning of the pink, lavender, and blue (ratio 2:1:2) flag as this: "The pink color represents sexual attraction to the same sex only (gay and lesbian). The blue represents sexual attraction to the opposite sex only (straight) and the resultant overlap color purple represents sexual attraction to both sexes (bi)."
He also describes the flag's meaning in deeper terms, stating "The key to understanding the symbolism of the Bisexual pride flag is to know that the purple pixels of color blend unnoticeably into both the pink and blue, just as in the 'real world,' where bi people blend unnoticeably into both the gay/lesbian and straight communities.&lt;ref name="mashableglossary"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Petronzio|first1=Matt|title=A Storied Glossary of Iconic LGBT Flags and Symbols|url=https://mashable.com/2014/06/13/lgbt-pride-symbols/#co._PVJ5mgqY|website=[[Mashable]]|date=June 13, 2014|accessdate=17 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The blue and pink overlapping triangle symbol represents [[bisexuality]] and bi pride. The origin of the symbol, sometimes facetiously referred to as the "biangles", is largely unknown, however the colours of bisexuality originate from this symbol: pink for attraction to women, blue for attraction to men, and lavender for attraction to both, as well as a reference to queerness.&lt;ref name="mashableglossary" /&gt;

===Intersex===
{{Main|Intersex flag}}
[[File:Intersex flag.svg|thumb|left|150px|alt=A yellow background with a purple circle in the middle, representing intersex people.|[[Intersex flag|Intersex pride]]]]

[[Intersex]] people are those who do not exhibit all the biological characteristics of male or female, or exhibit a combination of characteristics, at birth.  Between 0.05% and 1.7% of the population is estimated to have intersex traits.&lt;ref name="United Nations Free &amp; Equal factsheet on Intersex"&gt;https://www.unfe.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/UNFE-Intersex.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ISNA frequency"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isna.org/faq/frequency |title=How common is intersex? &amp;#124; Intersex Society of North America |publisher=Isna.org |date= |accessdate=2009-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The intersex pride flag was created by [[Intersex Human Rights Australia]] in July 2013 to create a flag "that is not derivative, but is yet firmly grounded in meaning".

A "P" with the tail converted to an arrow with a cross is also sometimes used. It predates the flag and is still in use today. The cross on the "P"'s tail refers to the cross on the Venus or female symbol (♀), and the arrow refers to the arrow on the Mars or male symbol (♂).&lt;ref name="Pansexual Files"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://avia-viridis.neocities.org/sof/pan.html | title=Sexual Orientation Files: Pansexual | accessdate=27 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; While it does not technically have a name, it is sometimes colloquially referred to as "the pansexual symbol".

===Transgender===
[[File:Transgender Pride flag.svg|thumb|right|150px|[[Transgender flags|Transgender pride]]]]

A transgender symbol is the [[Transgender flags#Transgender Pride Flag|Transgender Pride Flag]] designed by transgender woman [[Monica Helms]] in 1999,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.advocate.com/arts-entertainment/art/2014/11/12/smithsonians-queer-collection | title=The Smithsonian's Queer Collection | publisher=[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]] | date=12 November 2014 | accessdate=5 June 2015 | author=Fairyington, Stephanie}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was first shown at a pride parade in Phoenix, Arizona, USA in 2000.&lt;ref name=transcastro&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/11/20/transgender-flag_n_2166742.html "Transgender Flag Flies In San Francisco's Castro District After Outrage From Activists" by Aaron Sankin], HuffingtonPost, November 20, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; It was flown from a large public flagpole in San Francisco's [[Castro District]] beginning November 19, 2012 in commemoration of the [[Transgender Day of Remembrance]].&lt;ref name=transcastro /&gt; The flag represents the transgender community and consists of five horizontal stripes: two light blue, two pink, with a white stripe in the center. Helms described the meaning of the flag as follows:
:"The stripes at the top and bottom are light blue, the traditional color for baby boys. The stripes next to them are pink, the traditional color for baby girls.&lt;ref name=transcastro /&gt; The white stripe is for people that are nonbinary, feel that they don't have a gender."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/entry/we-have-a-navy-veteran-to-thank-for-the-transgender-pride-flag_us_5978c060e4b0e201d57a711f | title = We Have A Navy Veteran To Thank For The Transgender Pride Flag | first1 = Emma | last1 = Gray | first2 = Alanna | last2 = Vagianos | work = Huffington Post | date = July 27, 2017 | accessdate = 2017-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url = https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/bransonlb/the-veteran-who-created-the-trans-pride-flag-reacts-to | title = The Veteran Who Created The Trans Pride Flag Reacts To Trump's Trans Military Ban | first = Branson | last = LB | work = Buzzfeed | date = July 26, 2017 | accessdate = 2018-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pattern is such that no matter which way you fly it, it is always correct, signifying us finding correctness in our lives.&lt;ref name=transcastro /&gt;

[[Philadelphia]] became the first county government in the U.S. to raise the transgender pride flag in 2015. It was raised at [[Philadelphia City Hall|City Hall]] in honor of Philadelphia's 14th Annual [[Mazzoni Center|Trans Health Conference,]] and remained next to the US and City of Philadelphia flags for the entirety of the conference. Then-[[Michael Nutter|Mayor Michael Nutter]] gave a speech in honor of the trans community's acceptance in Philadelphia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.advocate.com/politics/transgender/2015/06/04/philadelphia-raises-transgender-pride-flag-first-time|title=Philadelphia Raises the Transgender Pride Flag for the First Time|last=|first=|date=|access-date=|work=The Advocate}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A symbol of the female (♀), male (♂) and [[Genderqueer]] (⚨) symbols combined around a circle is sometimes used to represent transgender people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gendertalk.com/tg-symbol/|title=Transgender Symbol|last=|first=|date=|website=Gender talk|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://transgendersociety.yolasite.com/history-of-transgender-symbolism.php|title=history of transgender symbolism|last=|first=|date=|website=transgender society|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also under the trans or transgender umbrella are all those who identify off the [[gender binary]]. There are many different identities within this category including [[genderqueer]], [[two-spirit]], [[gender fluid]], [[third gender]], and [[androgyny]].&lt;ref name="genderqueerid.com"&gt;[http://genderqueerid.com/gq-terms GENDERQUEER AND NON-BINARY IDENTITIES - Genderqueer Identities &amp;amp; Terminology&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other symbols==
In addition to major symbols of the LGBT community, less-popular symbols have been used to represent members' unity, pride, shared values, and allegiance to one another.

===Blue feather===
In the [[Society for Creative Anachronism]], LGBT members often wear a blue feather to indicate an affiliation with Clan Blue Feather, a group of SCA members promoting the study of LGBT culture and people in the Middle Ages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bluefeather.org |title=Clan Blue Feather |publisher=Bluefeather.org |date= |accessdate=2018-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this affiliation, blue feathers have also been used at some [[Renaissance fair|Renaissance Faires]] and [[Pagan]] events.

===Calamus plant===

According to some interpretations, American poet [[Walt Whitman]] used the [[Sweet flag|calamus]] plant to represent homoerotic love.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Herrero-Brasas|first= Juan A.|title=Walt Whitman's Mystical Ethics of Comradeship: Homosexuality and the Marginality of Friendship at the Crossroads of Modernity|year=2010|publisher=SUNY|isbn=978-1-4384-3011-9|page=46|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ca4FuDfH-cMC&amp;pg=PA46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Triangle badges of the Third Reich==
{{Main|Pink triangle|Persecution of homosexuals in Nazi Germany and the Holocaust}}

One of the oldest of these symbols is the inverted [[pink triangle]] that male homosexuals in [[Nazi concentration camps]] were required to wear on their clothing. The badge is one of several [[Nazi concentration camp badges|badges]] that internees wore to identify what kind of prisoners they were.&lt;ref name=Plant1988&gt;{{Cite book | last=Plant | first=Richard | year=1988 | title=The pink triangle: the Nazi war against homosexuals | edition=revised | publisher=H.

The pink triangle was used exclusively with male prisoners, as lesbians were not included under [[Paragraph 175]], a statute which made homosexual acts between males a crime. The [[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum|United States Holocaust Memorial Museum (USHMM)]] stipulates that this was because women were seen as subordinate to men, and the [[Third Reich|Nazi state]] did not feel that homosexual women presented the same threat to masculinity as homosexual men. According to USHMM, many women were arrested and imprisoned for "asocial" behaviour, a classification applied to those who did not conform to the [[Nazism|Nazi]] ideal of a woman's role: cooking, cleaning, kitchen work, child raising, and passivity. Asocial women were tagged with an inverted [[Black triangle (badge)|black triangle]].&lt;ref name=USHMM1 /&gt; Many lesbians reclaimed this symbol for themselves as gay men reclaimed the pink triangle.&lt;ref name="remember1"/&gt;

'''SIP requests''' are the messages in the [[Session Initiation Protocol]] that initiate a functionality of the protocol. They are sent by a user agent client to the server, and are answered with one or more [[SIP responses]], which return a result code of the transaction, and generally indicate the success, failure, or other state of the transaction.

|Andromeda Strain also known as La Linea Verde de Muerte; The Green Line of Death.
|&lt;span style="display:none"&gt;Andromeda Strain&lt;/span&gt;''[[The Andromeda Strain]]''&lt;br /&gt;by [[Michael Crichton]]
|A deadly, green, [[crystal]]line, [[astrobiology|extraterrestrial]] agent of indeterminate origin. It erodes the vessel walls of the [[circulatory system]], causing death by either triggering the body's [[coagulation]] response (resulting in the entire system clotting in a few seconds), or by [[Human brain|cerebral]] [[hematoma]]s (accompanied by [[dementia]]) if clotting is prevented. It evolves at a rapid rate, is spread by airborne [[transmission (medicine)|transmission]], and is extremely [[infectious disease|contagious]]. However, it only functions within a very narrow [[pH]] range, and cannot survive in a human body if that human's blood chemistry is [[alkalosis|too alkaline]] or [[acidosis|too acidic]].
|-
|ARIA – Alien Retrograde Infectious Amnesia
|[[ARIA (novel)|''ARIA'' (novel)]]&lt;br /&gt;by [[Geoff Nelder]]
|A virus inducing infectious [[retrograde amnesia]].The effect of ARIA is apocalyptic in that the infected lose their memory backwards at the rate of a year’s worth per week.
|-
|Atlantis Complex
|''[[Artemis Fowl: The Atlantis Complex]]''&lt;br /&gt;by [[Eoin Colfer]]
|A psychosis common in guilt ridden fairies, but is contracted by Artemis by his dabbling in fairy magic. The symptoms include obsessive compulsive behavior, paranoia, multiple personality disorder, and in his case professing his love to [[Holly Short]].

|-
|Black Trump Virus
|&lt;span style="display:none"&gt;Wild Cards by George R. R. Martin&lt;/span&gt;''[[Wild Cards]]''&lt;br /&gt; by [[George R. R. Martin]]
|The Black Trump virus is a variant of Xenovirus Takis-B. Rather than a cure, this retrovirus was designed to kill aces, jokers, latents, and wild card carriers. [[Dr. Tachyon]]'s original Trump virus was designed to turn wild carders back into nats (a slang term for naturals), those who do not carry Xenovirus Takis-A in their system.
|-
|Bloodfire
|''[[Blood Nation]]''
|A virus that gestated in [[Gray wolf|wolves]] two thousand years ago. The first to be infected was [[Genghis Khan]]. It causes the symptoms usually associated with [[vampirism]], [[photosensitivity]] and invincibility. The entire nation of Russia is infected, except for a few [[feral]] children. The virus can cause extreme [[mutation]], for example the snake's tail present in the Khan's head scientist.
|-
|[[Brainpox]] "Cobra"
|''[[The Cobra Event]]''
|A genetically engineered [[recombinant virus]] made from the [[nuclear polyhedrosis virus]], the [[rhinovirus]], and [[smallpox]]. It causes nightmares, fever, chills, runny nose, encephalitis (brain swelling), and [[herpes]]-like boils in the mouth and genitals, followed by a short period of aggression and autocannibalism preceding death. Used as a bioterror weapon.
|-
|Buscard's Murrain a.k.a. Wormword
|[[Looking For Jake|"Entry Taken from a Medical Encyclopaedia"]]&lt;br /&gt; by [[China Miéville]]
|An [[echolalia]]-like disease in which a specific pronunciation of a certain word—the "wormword"—leads to fatally degenerative cognitive ability as a result of an [[encephalopathy]]. Buscard's Murrain is infectious, as the afflicted desire to hear others pronounce the wormword.
|-
|[[The Stand#"Captain Trips"|Captain Trips]] ("Superflu", "tube neck", and "project blue")
|&lt;span style="display:none"&gt;Stand&lt;/span&gt;''[[The Stand]]''&lt;br /&gt;by [[Stephen King]]
|A deadly, [[influenza|flu]]-based virus. Created as a biological weapon codenamed Blue. Causes a lethally high fever and is highly contagious. It is deadly because as the body fights off the disease, it mutates into different strains of influenza, making [[Immunity (medical)|immunity]] next to impossible.
|-
|Clone-Killing Nanovirus
|''[[Star Wars Republic Commando: Hard Contact]]''&lt;br /&gt;by [[Karen Traviss]]
|A nanovirus developed by the [[Confederacy of Independent Systems]] designed specifically to kill the [[cloning|clones]] of Jango Fett. Its creator, Ovolot Qail Uthan, is captured by Republic Commandos before her research is complete, however. In later books in the series, it is revealed (though not to any of the main characters, but to the reader through both Palpatine's and Dr. Uthan's private journals), [[Chancellor Palpatine]] secretly chooses not to completely destroy all evidence or research of the virus, but rather opts to hold onto it as a back-up plan, should the clone army ever be turned against him.
|-
|Collins' Syndrome
|[[The Legend of Deathwalker]] by [[David Gemmell]]
|A mutating disease that often starts with pain and sensitivity in the victims nipples, then forms a temporary tumor in the brain as it feeds upon the genetic material of the brain cells, sapping away the victims critical thinking skills and intelligence, once it reaches its critical density, the tumor disbands into the bloodstream, the virus going into a form of hibernation, leaving its victim in a state of near absolute uselessness.  Once the virus detects that it has entered a new host due to differences in protein markers of the victims cells, the process begins again.
|-
|[[Cooties]]
|Various
|A term used by children in the United States, with varied meaning. "Cooties" generally refers to an invisible germ, bug, or microscopic monster, transferred by skin to skin contact, usually with a member of the opposite sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | author = Sue Samuelson | title = The Cooties Complex | volume = 39 | date = July 1980 | pages = 198–210 | publisher = Western States Folklore Society | jstor = 1499801 | journal = Western Folklore | issue = 3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
| Curse of the Warmbloods
| [[The Underland Chronicles]] by [[Suzanne Collins]]
| A disease created by Doctor Neveeve in the city of Regalia. She gave the disease to fleas, which instead of getting infected, spread the disease around warmblooded creatures, including people. Symptoms include purple blemishes, coughing, choking, and a swelled tongue. The cure was originally believed to be a plant named starshade, though the true cure was made in Regalia.
|-
|[[Dar-Kosis]]
|''[[Gor|The Gor Series]]''&lt;br /&gt;by [[John Norman]]
|Dar-kosis is a virulent, horrible, wasting disease and is similar in many ways to leprosy. It is taught by the Initiates (who claim to be the voice of the Priest-Kings of Gor) that Dar-Kosis is a holy disease.
|-
|[[Demon Pox]]
|''[[The Infernal Devices]]''&lt;br /&gt;by
[[Cassandra Clare]]
|Demon pox, also known as astriola, is a rare but debilitating disease that affects Shadowhunters and is caused by sexual contact with demons.
Mundanes are immune to the disease, as demon pox is assumed to be caused by the interaction of demon poisons with the angelic nature of Shadowhunters.
|-
|[[Descolada]]
|''[[Speaker for the Dead]]''&lt;br /&gt;by [[Orson Scott Card]]
|A quasi-conscious self-modifying organism capable of infecting any form of life. "Descolada" is also the Portuguese word for "unglued". In the context of the book, this refers to the Descolada virus's effects: it breaks the link of the [[DNA double helix]] (ungluing it) and induces mutations.
|-
|Despotellis
|''[[Green Lantern Corps]]''
| A sentient virus and a member of the Sinestro Corps. It could create non-sentient duplicates of itself creating a plague capable of killing infected victims within minutes, and can also destroy these duplicates, leaving no trace of their presence. Among the victims of its plague was [[Kyle Rayner]]'s mother.
|-
|Diseasemaker's Croup
|[[Fragile Things]] by [[Neil Gaiman]]
|A disorder 'afflicting those who habitually and pathologically catalogue and construct diseases.' It is characterized by increasingly nonsensical speech and writing patterns and an obsessive insistence on trying to repeat previous statements out of context.
|-
|[[Dragon Pox]]
|''[[Harry Potter|The Harry Potter Series]]''&lt;br /&gt;by [[J.K. Rowling]]
|Dragon pox is a potentially fatal contagious disease that occurs in wizards and witches. Its symptoms are presumably similar to Muggle illnesses like smallpox and chicken pox. However, in addition to leaving the victim's skin pockmarked, dragon pox causes a lasting greenish tinge. Simpler cases present with a green-and-purple rash between the toes and sparks coming out of the nostrils when the patient sneezes. Elderly patients are apparently more susceptible to dragon pox than younger ones. Gunhilda of Gorsemoor developed a cure for dragon pox, but the disease has not been completely eradicated, as is evidenced by the fact that it is still treated by the Magical Bugs ward at St. Mungo's Hospital.
|-
|Dryditch Fever
|''[[Salamandastron]]''&lt;br /&gt; by [[Brian Jacques]]
|A deadly disease causing weakness, hot flashes, chills, and dizziness. The victim is usually bedridden until eventual death. The only known cure are Flowers of Icetor boiled in spring water.
|-
|DX
|''[[The Lost World (Crichton novel)|The Lost World]]''&lt;br /&gt;by [[Michael Crichton]]
|An unknown [[prion]] dubbed "DX" by scientists on Isla Sorna. It is similar to [[mad cow disease]] and was the result of feeding ground-up sheep to carnivorous dinosaurs. DX increased the mortality rate of newborn dinosaurs and is eventually fatal to adult dinosaurs. In order to combat DX, InGen scientists released animals into the wild of Isla Sorna. The prion initially infected carnivorous dinosaurs such as [[velociraptor]]s and [[procompsognathus]], which would then spread the disease to herbivores such as [[apatosaurus]], and the apatosaur carcasses would be eaten by compys, which would then spread the disease to other carcasses, and the cycle would repeat. Ian Malcolm said at the end of the novel that, because of the imbalance of carnivores and herbivores due to DX, the dinosaurs were doomed to die out.
|-
|Ebola Gulf A
|[[DC Comics]]
|Also known as "the Clench", due to the victims clenching their stomachs, Ebola Gulf is an evolved form of the [[Ebola|ebola virus]] created by the terrorist mastermind [[Ra's al Ghul]] after he consulted the ''Wheel of Plagues.''
|- id="Fire-Us"
|Fire-Us (Sounds like "Virus")
|[[Jennifer Armstrong#fire-us virus|Fire-Us series]]
|A viral infection that infects extremely fast and only infects those that produce sex hormones (i.e. those after puberty and women before menopause) or are taking medicine that include similar hormones. It was released by the President of the United States of America to start the world over, killing almost all adults within 2 weeks. As a result, children were left to fend for themselves, most of whom failed. Once all the targets of the virus were gone, it died out.
|-
|The Flare (virus VC321xb47)
|[[The Maze Runner|The Maze Runner series]]
|A highly contagious virus that infects the brain of its host, turning them into crazed blood-thirsty cannibals (essentially zombies) which are called Cranks. Less than 1% of the population is immune to the virus, and are called Munies. There is no cure for The Flare, but many wealthy people slow down the onslaught of the symptoms with an illegal drug called The Bliss, which slows down their brain activity. It was released by the governments of the world to help control overpopulation after the Sun Flares, but it eventually killed most of the people in the world.
|-
|Foul-Drought
|&lt;span style="display:none"&gt;Heir of Mistmantle by M. I. McAllister&lt;/span&gt;''[[The Heir of Mistmantle]]''&lt;br /&gt; by [[M. I. McAllister]]
|Disease caused from drinking poisoned water. Animals who have it will have pain, blurry sight and some will eventually die.
|-
|&lt;span style="display:none"&gt;Gray Death&lt;/span&gt;The Gray Death
|[[Gail Carson Levine]]'s ''[[The Two Princesses of Bamarre]]''
|Disease created from the noxious gas from the defeated dragon Yune's stomach. It comes on with no warning and is not contagious. There are three stages of the disease. The first stage is the weakness, and it can last anywhere from a week to six months. The second stage is the sleeping, and it always lasts nine days. The last stage is fever, and it always lasts three days. At the end of the fever stage, the victim will die. The only cure is water sent down from the fairies' Mount Ziriat. The cure will only be discovered ''when cowards find courage and rain falls over all Bamarre.''
|-
|Great Plague
|''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' by [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]
|A mysterious disease which swept down through every single kingdom of [[Middle-earth]] during the mid 1600s of the Third Age of the Sun. The Plague's origins are unknown except it was possibly contracted from the Corsairs who attacked [[Gondor]] in Third Age 1634, two years before the Plague occurred. The Plague was 90% fatal for nearly all inhabitants of Middle-earth, especially in Gondor and [[Arnor|the North]].
|-
|Greyscale
|''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]''
|Greyscale is a typically nonfatal disease akin to [[leprosy]]. It is first introduced in Stannis Baratheon's daughter Shireen. When it infects children, greyscale generally leaves children malformed and disabled but alive. However, in ''[[A Dance with Dragons]]'', it is revealed to be generally fatal to adults. The disease is contracted by touch and slowly turns the skin (small patches in children and the entire body in adults) of the victim to into a gray, stone-like form. It is said that the disease also drives its adult victims insane.
|-
|Hanahaki Disease, or Hanahaki Byou
|[[Korean, Japanese, and Chinese pop band and manga fandoms]]
|Hanahaki Disease (花吐き病 (Japanese); 하나하키병 (Korean); 花吐病 (Chinese)) is a fictional disease where the victim of unrequited love begins to cough up the petals and flowers of a flower growing in their lungs, which will eventually grow large enough to render breathing impossible if left untreated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/700157/standout-tales-of-love-survival-and-fantasy-from-high-school-writers |title=Standout tales of love, survival and fantasy from high school writers |last= Jumamil |first=Jannah Corrine B. |date=June 23, 2015 |website=Inquirer.net |access-date=January 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hanahaki can be cured through surgical removal of the plants' roots, but this excision also has the effect of removing the patient's capacity for romantic love. It can also be cured by the reciprocation of the victim's feelings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://fanlore.org/wiki/Hanahaki_Disease |title=Hanahaki Disease |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=September 21, 2017 |publisher=[[Fanlore]] |access-date=January 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|-
|Harlequin
|''[[Harlequin Rex]]'' by [[Owen Marshall]]
|A progressive and fatal neurological disease which causes an re-awakening of primordial senses and behaviors, set in near-future Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.owenmarshall.net.nz/bookshelf/reviews/harlequin_rex.asp|title=Harlequin Rex – book review.

|-
|Hourman Virus
|''[[DC One Million]]''
|Created by the living star [[Solaris (comics)|Solaris]], this plague was caused by [[nanomachines]]. It acted like both a biological virus and a computer virus, and could be spread to each type of victim by the other type. It was capable of wiping out humanity in twenty-four hours.
|-
|I-Pollen Degenerative Disorder
|[[DC Comics]]
[[Transmetropolitan]]
|The hero Spider Jerusalem has I-Pollen Degenerative Disorder, a disease he gained as a result of coming into contact with Information Pollen, pollen used to transmit information.

|-
|Inferno virus
|''[[Inferno (Brown novel)|Inferno]]''&lt;br&gt;by [[Dan Brown]]
|An airborne virus which incubated in water. It was released by the terrorist group the Consortium to kill off half of humanity and reproduce with only a third of ten individuals who were immune. The virus was modeled on the [[Black Death]]. Originally, its creator, Bertrand Zobrist, planned to have it as a waterborne virus, but changed it to airborne because it could infect faster. The Inferno virus can infect a human through damp air, and then it renders humans infertile. The plan was for the infected to die off and humanity to be rendered extinct.
|-
|Kellis-Amberlee
|''[[Feed (Grant novel)|Feed]]''&lt;br /&gt; by [[Mira Grant]]
|A spontaneous combination of two man-made viruses that exists in a 'reservoir condition' state without ill effects until the host's death, when any host over approximately 40 pounds undergoes virus amplification and becomes a zombie.

|&lt;span style="display:none"&gt;Star Wars Expanded Universe&lt;/span&gt;"[[Star Wars expanded universe|''Star Wars'' expanded universe]]"
|The Krytos virus was a deadly and highly contagious virus that only attacked non-human species. It could spread via a number of avenues, including [[Waterborne diseases|by water supplies]] and [[Airborne diseases|by air]]. The virus often killed its host in less than two weeks, resulting in a painful death.
|-
|[[Legacy Virus]]
|[[Marvel Multiverse]]
|A disease that targets only [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutants]], causing genetic and biological degradation and eventual death; shortly before death, the virus' effects will cause a violent, uncontrolled flare-up of the victim's [[Superpower (ability)|superhuman abilities]]. One strain of it can also infect humans, as it did to Moria McTaggart.
|-
|Life-Eater Virus
|''[[Warhammer 40,000]]'' novels
|The Life-eater virus is a form of [[necrotizing fasciitis]] that causes all biological matter to break down into its component parts, releasing toxic, flammable gas that can be ignited with a single explosion. The virus eats itself when there is nothing else to attack. It is quite effective against Tyrranids. In the short-story anthology ''Planetkill'', an updated strain goes after the [[soul]], turning the population into zombies, created by a Techpriest inhabited by a daemonic Unclean One.
|-
|Love Sickness
|''[[One Piece]]''
|A mostly psychosomatic disease that can only be contracted by the empress of the [[#Kuja Tribe|Kuja Tribe]] if she falls in love with a man and denies the feeling. It causes weakness, pain, and eventually death from declining health. The only known cure is for the victim to accept the emotions and pursue the object of her desire. This disease has killed many previous empresses, and is currently a threat to Boa Hancock, who pursues [[#Luffy|Monkey D. Luffy]] to avoid the symptoms.
|-
|Leezle Pon
|''[[Green Lantern Corps]]''

|-
|Neurodermatitis
|''Dark Benediction (1951)''&lt;br /&gt;by [[Walter M. Miller, Jr.|Walter Miller Jr.]]
|A [[pathogen]] causing rapid nervous system evolution and development of new sensory organs, which causes synesthetic psychosis in unprepared hosts. Sent to Earth by an alien race living in symbiosis with it, in the hopes of furthering other races' advance.

|This is actually two viruses: The first, of unknown origin but seems to be in all humans, causes them to reanimate into zombies once they die. The second is carried in the body fluids, especially in the saliva, of the "drifters", or walking dead. When they bite a living human, that person contracts the second disease and develops a severe fever, resulting in coma and then death... and then is reanimated by the first virus within seconds. The drifters have rudimentary brain function, allowing them to walk, crawl, or run toward their prey. They have foggy white eyes, can only moan with hunger, have enhanced hearing and sense of smell, and can only be stopped by piercing the brain -- when they drop dead, again.  A bite from a drifter is always fatal, but their body fluids in the eyes or mouth of a living person can sometimes cause a survivable "burn" which leaves the living person with an immunity to the second virus (future bites do not kill them). There are a few rare drifters that experienced "burn" but died anyway -- leaving them as a reddish-skinned intelligent zombie.

|Plague of Insomnia
| ''[[One Hundred Years of Solitude]]''&lt;br /&gt;by [[Gabriel García Márquez]]
|An epidemic brought into the Buendía household and the town of Macondo by Rebeca; the adopted daughter of José Arcadio Buendía and Úrsula Iguarán. This plague, originally coming from the northern Indian kingdoms in La Guajira (Colombia), is identified by the symptoms of wide-open, glowing eyes like those of a cat, and the [[insomnia|impossibility of sleeping]]. Those infected (in the novel consisting of the entire town of Macondo) feel no tiredness or sleepiness whatsoever and hence can work all day and night. However, as time advances, those infected begin to [[amnesia|lose all their memories]] and [[epistemology|knowledge of the world]]; ultimately leaving them in a state in which they have forgotten the names and uses of all things and their own identities. The plague is generally seen as one of the most prominent demonstrations of [[magical realism]] in García Márquez's literary works.

|The Pulse
|''[[Cell (novel)|Cell]]'' by [[Stephen King]]
|A powerful virus which lies dormant inside [[mobile phones]] and which requires a powerful signal to set off. The exact unleashers are unknown, but are implied to be a terrorist group due to numerous theories in the novel. The virus is implied to have been released just after [[September 11th, 2001|September 11th]], and lain dormant in cell phones ever since. Once the right signal is transmitted and leaked into incoming phone calls, the caller's brain cells immediately disintegrate and they are unable to recognize friend from foe; they are even unable to recognize other people infected with the virus. Inevitably, the infected callers become psychotic and start killing each other, the chaos of which lasts approximately two days before the infected callers have become "stable" enough to cooperate and recognize each other.

|Ratititis
|[[Boy (book)|Roald Dahl's Boy]]
|A fictional disease invented by [[Roald Dahl]]'s friend Thwaites during their schooldays in [[Llandaff]]. Thwaites made this up to amuse Roald and the other friends, but he says his dad told him about the disease, which is apparently contracted from eating [[liquorice|liquorice bootlaces]]. Thwaites says that the bootlaces actually have rat's blood rather than licquorice, and they are done this way by rat-catchers bringing their rats to the sweet factory where they pound the rats into a paste, then mash it up to form licquorice bootlaces. Thwaites told Roald and his friends never to eat them, because if they did, a rat's tail would burst out of their buttocks and their teeth would turn into fangs. Only Roald and his friends saw the joke; Thwaites took it with deadpan humour.

|An alien [[parasitoid]] macrovirus. The adult aliens resemble deformed potato beings with legs, while the younger aliens—nicknamed "shit-weasels" because they can be created in a [[Host (biology)|host organism's]] stomach and escape by eating their host's body between the [[stomach]] and [[anus]] – are legless, smaller versions of the adult alien. Both adult and young aliens have a mouth consisting of a slit on the underside of the head that goes down the length of the worm. The lips separate to reveal hundreds of teeth that can bite through steel.

|-
|Sakutia
|''[[Teen Titans]]''
|Sakutia, also known as Green Fever, is an extremely rare lethal viral disease found primarily in the African region of Lamumba. The virus attaches itself to a victim's DNA, enabling the host body to instinctively rewrite their own genetic code. Typically, a host relies upon primitive instinct when affecting such a change, rendering them capable of shapeshifting into a wide variety of forms (usually animals). Sakutia victims suffer from one other noticeable side effect is that their hair and skin turn permanently green in hue.

|Sevai and Vedet
|&lt;span style="display:none"&gt;Always Coming Home&lt;/span&gt;''[[Always Coming Home]]''&lt;br /&gt;by [[Ursula K Le Guin]]
|Genetic diseases of people and animals in the postapocalyptic setting of ''Always Coming Home'', caused by the leftover chemical and radiation pollution. Vedet involves personality disorders and dementia; sevai usually leads to blindness and other sensory loss, along with degeneration of muscle control. Both diseases are painful, crippling, incurable, and fatal. Severity of onset and the length of the course of the illness varied: major damage leads to nonviability in the womb (with a quarter of all children in the Valley being stillborn due to sevai); minor damage might not show up until old age.

|''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]''&lt;br /&gt;by [[Douglas Adams]]
|Mentioned as being "still a terminal disease in some parts of the Galaxy," this disease seems rife amongst the population of Betelgeuse 5, the fifth planet of the sun [[Betelgeuse]]. It killed off the father of [[Ford Prefect]] when he was so ashamed that Ford could not say his birth name, "Ix", and this embarrassed Ford and resulted in him being mocked during school.

|The Sickness/Imperial bioweapons project I71A/Project: Blackwing
|''[[Death Troopers]]'', ''Red Harvest''
|A virus artificially created by the [[Sith|Sith Lord]] Darth Drear thousands of years ago in order to achieve immortality. Centuries later, Darth Scabrous successfully completed Drear's unfinished work, but accidentally modified it into a semi-sentient hive mind that creates zombies. The Sith academy on Odacin-Fauster was wiped out by the plague. Thousands of years later, Darth Vader commissioned the [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Empire]]'s bioweapons division to recreate the virus. Upon completion, the virus was loaded onto the Star Destroyer ''Vector'' for transport to a testing site. En route, the tanks leaked and the Destroyer's crew was zombified. The virus is characterized by grey goo.

|Solanum Virus
|''[[World War Z]]''/''[[The Zombie Survival Guide]]'' by [[Max Brooks]]
|A virus which has existed since the beginning of human history, which is highly contagious through bodily fluids such as [[blood]]. Solanum symptoms include [[dementia]], [[paralysis]] in the extremities, and discoloration of the wound, which increase as the virus replicates itself. The virus is centered on the brain, and destroys the cells of the brain and replaces them with the virus. In doing so, the infected victims are declared clinically dead. The virus takes around sixteen hours to replicate, although it varies from individual to individual. Once Solanum has fully replicated, the victim awakes from the coma, with an unquenchable desire for [[cannibalism|human flesh]]. The victim also exhibits typical zombie-like behavior such as psychotic behavior and mindless rage, and can only be killed by destruction of the brain.

|Space plague
|[[Alisa Selezneva]] books&lt;br /&gt;by [[Kir Bulychov]]
|A lethal, extremely contagious virus responsible for destroying numerous inhabited planets. Difficult to combat due to the virus being very good in mimicry, as well as capable of forming a [[Group_mind_(science_fiction)|hive mind]] which could direct its own mutations. Earth had narrowly averted destruction in the mid-21st Century thanks to the ship carrying two infected being quarantined on Pluto.

|Spattergroit
|''[[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix]] and [[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows]]''
|A disease that covers the victim in purple [[pustules]] and renders them unable to speak.  It may be a type of fungus, as [[Ron Weasley]] says that the effect of being unable to speak occurs "once the fungus has spread to your uvula". The only known cure, according to the portrait of a Healer in [[St. Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries]], is to bind the [[liver]] of a [[toad]] around the victim's throat and stand [[nude]] in a barrel of [[eel]]'s eyes under a full moon. The portrait said that he believed Ron had this disease, due to the "[[Freckle|unsightly blemishes]]" on his face. Ron would later use this disease in [[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows]] as an excuse as to why he was unable to return to [[Hogwarts]], when in actuality he and his friends were out searching for [[Lord Voldemort]]'s [[Horcruxes]].

|Stone Sickness
|''[[The Edge Chronicles]]'' by [[Paul Stewart (writer)|Paul Stewart]] and [[Chris Riddell]]
|Not a human disease, but one which affects humans and other inhabitants of the Edge by attacking the rocks of the flight ships which is the primary means of transport and communication on the Edge. As the flight ships are carried aloft by the rocks, this puts an end to business and trade, resulting in a brief societal collapse followed by a gradual rebuilding of society when the Edge's inhabitants become accustomed to life with Stone-sickness. Symptoms of infected flight rocks include a brief scar, followed by an open wound and a gaping hole as the rock dissolves. Eventually the sky ship drops clean out of the sky. Many theories abound on the origin of Stone-sickness. Some people blame the gods. Others blame the Mother Storm, the mysterious meteorological creator of the Edge. Some say that the sky pirate captain Cloud Wolf who perished in the Mother Storm somehow infected her and the Stone-sickness is a result of his pestilence. It is only at the end of the series that it is revealed the Gloamglozer created the disease and it had been incubating inside the Stone Gardens ever since he fled the city of Sanctaphrax almost a century before the sickness.

|''[[Stormbreaker]]''
|A genetically engineered version of the smallpox virus which Iraq made in the Gulf War. Herod Sayle used the disease in his plans for vengeance. He genetically modified it so it would kill whoever it infected immediately. Fortunately, the plan was stopped by Alex and the virus was taken and quarantined by MI6. Implied in ''Snakehead'' that Sayle acquired the virus (apparently the R-5) from SCORPIA, a SPECTRE-like criminal organisation that sponsored his project.

|"T4 Angel Virus"
|''[[The Hollows (series)|Hollows (series)]]'' by [[Kim Harrison]]
|The result of genetic engineering, the T4 Angel Virus was spread by infected tomatoes. It wiped out a large percentage of humanity, along with the elves and several other species which had been secretly coexisting. Other species unaffected by the virus, such as witches, vampires, and werewolves, soon equaled humanity's depleted numbers and began living openly. Tomatoes are still feared and shunned by humans throughout the series.

|-
|TS-19
|''[[The Walking Dead (comics)|The Walking Dead]]''
|A (presumably [[Biological virus|viral]]) disease of unknown origin. When a human is infected by it, the disease will infect all cells, eventually resulting in the [[clinical death]] of the host. The symptoms that occur before the victim's clinical death, include [[fever]], [[headache]], [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]], [[confusion]], [[hallucinations]] and [[paralysis]]. The disease has a very short [[incubation period]] of around 16 hours. After the victim's clinical death, the host will be revitalized and will wake up exhibiting [[zombie (fictional)|zombie]]-like behavior. However the disease will only activate lower brain function, mostly those controlled by the brain-stem, where feeding and motor functions are controlled. The host becomes a violent mindless [[cannibal]], and can infect other people by biting. The disease leads to society's collapse and results in a world stricken by a [[zombie apocalypse]]. The transmission of TS-19 has been variable and inconsistent in the media: A person that dies of asphyxiation will become reanimated by the virus, implying an airborne capability, yet it doesn't affect living humans. A pregnant woman that recently gives birth to a child will most likely succumb to the virus due to less-than-sanitary conditions and a weakened immune system.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} And walkers can transmit the virus through scratches and bites but not through blood and other bodily fluids making contact with a living person's skin.

|(unknown)
|''[[Please Save My Earth]] (Boku no Chikyū o Mamotte)''&lt;br /&gt;by [[Saki Hiwatari]]
|A mysterious, highly infectious disease that moves quickly through a group and kills its host. The disease's origin, genetic make-up, and its vector are unknown, as is its longevity once outside the host body, but speculation is that it can continue to live on inert/non-biologic surfaces (such as plastic, glass, cement, etc.) in a dormant state long after it has no living host to latch onto. The only known cure for this unnamed disease was developed by the doctor, Shukaido, who succumbed to the disease soon after developing the cure. Tragically, the cure only lasts for approximately seven years before its effects wear off, and the suppressed disease in the victim's system re-emerges at full strength, killing him/her. The last known victim of this plague was Shion.

|''[[I Am Legend (novel)|I Am Legend]]''&lt;br /&gt;by [[Richard Matheson]]
|A [[bacillus]] (rod-shaped) bacterium that causes photosensitivity, hysterical blindness near mirrors, overdevelopment of canine teeth, and production of a bulletproof adhesive. Victims feed on blood. While in the body, it is anaerobic, and causes the victim to exhibit zombie-like behavior. Outside the body, it [[Sporulation|sporulates]] into dust. If an infected person is cut deep enough, the bacteria turns them into powder. Can be treated, but not cured, with a pill containing a fusion inhibitor and dehydrated blood.

|White Sickness
|''Burning Bright''&lt;br /&gt; by [[Melissa Scott]]
| White-Sickness, a pneumatic histopathy, also known as lung‑rot oruhanjao, translatable as "drown‑yourself" in the language of the story's aliens – is classified as a dangerous condition less because it is fatal, which it is, than because it is contagious until treated. Simple organ transplants inevitably fail, due to the mechanisms by which the disease alters the lung tissue, slowly dissolving it into a thick white mucus, so that the patient drowns in body fluids even as the lungs themselves stop working.

|Xenovirus Takis-A
|&lt;span style="display:none"&gt;Wild Cards by George R. R. Martin&lt;/span&gt;''[[Wild Cards]]''&lt;br /&gt; by [[George R. R. Martin]]
|Xenovirus Takis-A, also known as the wild card virus, works by completely altering the victim's DNA. It has been theorized that the process is guided by the victim's own subconscious, influenced by the person's desires or fears. In this way, the virus works as a modern Aladdin's Lamp. The transformation is extremely individual, no two persons are affected in exactly the same way. In 90% of cases, the victim's body can't assimilate the extreme changes, and the person dies horribly. These cases are called black queens. From the survivors, 9 out of 10 are changed for the worse, becoming monstrous creatures nicknamed jokers. The miraculous 1% of infected are changed for the better and become aces, gifted with superhuman physical or mental capabilities while still remaining human in appearance.

|Xenovirus Takis-B
|&lt;span style="display:none"&gt;Wild Cards by George R. R. Martin&lt;/span&gt;''[[Wild Cards]]''&lt;br /&gt; by [[George R. R. Martin]]
|Xenovirus Takis-B, also known as the trump virus, is an artificial organism created by [[Dr. Tachyon]] as a possible cure for the wild card virus. Ideally, the trump virus reverses the genetic changes caused by the wild card virus, transforming a wild carder back into a normal person. The trump virus is only successful in about twenty-four percent of attempts. Forty-seven percent of the time it doesn’t work at all, and an appalling twenty-nine percent of the time, it outright kills the patient. In other words, it is more likely to kill than cure. The Jokertown Clinic only uses the trump virus as a last resort, in the most severe cases where the victim has nothing to lose.

|''[[Cabin Fever (2002 film)|Cabin Fever]]''&lt;br /&gt;''[[Cabin Fever 2: Spring Fever]]''
|[[Necrotizing fasciitis]] caused by an unknown bacterium which causes massive [[hemorrhaging]] and [[tissue necrosis]]. The first symptom of the disease is usually a painful rash, which develops into a scabby or weeping wound. In later stages, tissues become soft and slough away. The initial rash stage can be exacerbated by harsh physical trauma, as was seen when one afflicted woman discovered hand-shaped rashes on her body, where she had recently been tightly held during a passionate [[one night stand|sexual encounter]]. It also seemed to indicate that physical exertion also accelerates the progression of the disease. The disease is transmitted when an infected creatures' blood is exposed to a victim's bloodstream (bare skin contact with infectious blood is implied to not result in infection). It can also be contracted through [[sexually transmitted diseases|unprotected sexual activity]] and by [[Waterborne diseases|drinking contaminated water]]. The disease spreads cross-species and was initially discovered in a dead dog. Where the dog contracted the disease is unknown. Despite the name of the franchise, fever is never indicated as being a symptom of the disease.

|Krippin Virus (KV)
|''[[I Am Legend (film)|I Am Legend]]''
|A genetically re-engineered [[measles]] virus originally created as a "miracle cure" for [[cancer]], but mutated into a lethal, highly pathogenic strain. KV has a 90% mortality rate; less than 1% of humans are [[immune]]. Two transmission vectors for the pathogen are inhalation and infected blood, with two corresponding immunity profiles. Infected humans who did not die began exhibiting early symptoms of [[rabies]] and degenerated into a state driven by rage. A major symptom is that the [[adrenal gland]]s are "permanently open", giving victims increased strength, speed and agility but also a faster [[metabolism]]. This results in increased [[body temperature]], [[heart rate]], and breathing speed, making those infected [[hyperventilation|hyperventilate]] constantly. Pupils became permanently dilated and skin became hypersensitive to [[UV radiation]], forcing infected hosts into a [[Nocturnality|nocturnal life cycle]]. Loss of body hair is another symptom. Non-humans such as [[rat]]s and dogs are also susceptible to KV. They are sensitive to blood. These infected are similar to [[vampire]]s.

Here, it is an untreatable, terminal condition which is nearly pain-free, but which leads to coma and death within a couple of weeks to a couple of months at the most. It is explained as a recently discovered condition, described by and named for Sir Trevor Lampington, a character who also appears in the plot. In the [[Last Holiday (2006 film)|2006 remake]], the disease has morphed into a neurological disease causing multiple [[brain tumor]]s, rapidly progressing to death within a few weeks if not treated with an exorbitant operation.

It has a 100% mortality rate; however, the virus is inactive at temperatures below -10 degrees Celsius. The virus is stolen and is found in [[East Germany]], and during an attempt to steal it back it is released accidentally after the plane carrying it crashes. A [[pandemic]] spreads worldwide and is dubbed the "Italian Flu". Eventually wiping out all vertebrate life on Earth except for a grouping of Antarctic scientists and submariner's from various nations, the survivors set up a government council at the various research stations at the time of the devastating global pandemic and attempt to survive; however, the air worldwide is contaminated, making Antarctica the only safe place for the roughly 800 or so survivors.

|[[Rage (virus)|Rage (Human Cortico-Deficiency Virus)]]
|''[[28 Days Later]]''&lt;br /&gt;''[[28 Weeks Later]]''
|Rage causes extreme [[aggression]] in a victim ten to thirty seconds after being Infected with the disease. The disease is easily transmissible through any [[body fluid|bodily fluid]], except apparently semen. Because of this [[Infectious disease|extreme contagiousness]] and very short [[Incubation period|incubation time]], a crowd of hundreds could be infected by one single individual in a manner of minutes. A [[28 Days Later: The Aftermath|graphic novel]] based on the films purports that Rage is a [[recombinant virus|recombinant strain]] of [[Ebola]], though its symptoms are similar to that of [[rabies]]. Animal testing was being performed on the disease but one animal was released by activists unaware of the virus. The [[infection]] soon spread to eliminate the entire population of Britain save a few lucky individuals who managed to survive. Infected organisms die out in a few months, succumbing to [[starvation]], since they do not actually eat their victims. They also seem to drool blood constantly, due to the virus causing massive amounts of adrenaline to be pumped through the body, giving the infected heightened strength and endurance, to the point where they are able to completely overlook devastating injuries, such as loss of limbs. The infected also sport red eye colour, and bleed from the eyes, mouth and nose.

| ALZ-112, ALZ-113, "The Simian Flu"
|[[Planet of the Apes]] reboot series
|A genetically engineered retrovirus that was engineered in Gen-sys Laboratories. It was originally designed to be a cure for [[Alzheimer's disease]]. The ALZ-112 increased intelligence in apes and cured humans but only for a temporary period because of their immune system. ALZ-113 was a stronger version of the drug, but it developed into a viral airborne and contact strain that wiped out 90% of earth's human population leaving 10% immune to the virus, but only 2% survived the aftermath due to the civil unrest and collapse of civilisation. In humans it developed symptoms including, headache, sore throat, fever, vomiting, red eyes, coughing and finally death. The virus later mutates and causes the majority of humans to degenerate into a more primitive state by losing the ability to speak and making them less intelligent. In [[apes]] it increases their intelligence beyond that of a normal humans, makes their irises green, gives them a more human locomotion and alters their vocal cords to that of a humans.

|Thing cells
|&lt;span style="display:none"&gt;Thing&lt;/span&gt;[[The Thing (1982 film)|''The Thing'']]
|Triangle-pyramid viruses that makes up Thing monsters. If it enters another animal, it fuses with every cell of the host, possessing the host entirely. Each infected cell becomes an individual life form with its own desire to survive. An infected cell will seek out other cells to infect with its virus, and will work together with other infected cells to imitate other life forms. Because infected cells can rapidly duplicate and shapeshift, and because dislocated, pieces of an infected host will shapeshift and become separate entities. Infected hosts can only be killed if every individual cell is destroyed. Finally, hosts retain their knowledge and memories, allowing the virus to perfectly imitate any person and remain undetected. The only effective way of killing the Thing monsters is through incineration, for instance with a flamethrower.

The disease is contracted from rabid sheep, which are carnivorous, and these have been created by the film's antagonist Angus Oldfield. The sheep can contract the disease to humans by biting them. Once bitten, the disease eats away at one's brain and manifests in roughly twenty-four hours after infection. The disease is quite rapid, and once fully infected, one transforms into a "were-sheep" which is a humanoid, furry sheep monster, which can attack people on sight. Scientists working with Angus developed a cure, which was eventually given to all infected.

The disease transformed half of London into zombies in the film. The incubation of the disease varies from person to person; with the first onset it took hours before infection; but in its later infection it took a matter of minutes. The disease's symptoms are a high fever, and dementia, and can be transmitted through saliva and contact with the infected such as bites. The victim can only be killed by destroying the brain. The zombies act typical of zombies such as cannibalism and insanity.

|-
|Drafa Plague
|''[[Babylon 5]]''
|Destroys cells that produce neurotransmitters in the [[synapse|synaptic gap]], thus inhibiting [[Action potential|nerve signals]] from the brain to the rest of the body. Without such signals from the brain, the organs lose their ability to function correctly, much like [[ALS]] in humans. It is only contagious among those alien species which used specialized cells to produce neurotransmitters, and among these species, it is 100% terminal within 24 hours of the onset of symptoms. Initial symptoms include dizziness, numbness &amp; tingling in the extremities, sore throat, followed by progressively worsening ascending paralysis, euphoria, memory issues, then death. Fortunately for most of the other sentient races in Babylon 5, their lack of such specialized neurotransmitter cells render them immune to the disease, save for the Pak'Ma'Ra, whose Green Cells were similar enough to the Markab Yellow Cells that a Pak'Ma'Ra died of it on the station. The disease caused the Markab to go extinct.

Similar to the Black Death and HIV/AIDS among Humans, the Drafa Plague bears a stigma among the Markab as a disease that the public felt was only caught by those considered sinful, immoral or unclean by Markab standards, and a punishment by their gods for committing such acts. The disease was named after an island on their homeworld where its inhabitants were wiped out by the disease, an island noted in Markab history for its decadence and immorality. The story of the island was eventually used to frighten small Markab children into behaving. Even accusing a Markab of being infected with the disease can bring shame, paranoia, fear, and an angry response from the accused, and Markab doctors would frequently certify someone's death from the disease as death by natural causes, so the family could avoid a scandal and the implied accusation that they or their family were unclean or immoral.

Induces extreme [[paranoia]] and [[aggression]] in the infected, causing them to strike out against anyone or anything in an increasingly maddening desire to destroy. Symptoms include a deep reddish glow emanating from the infected. The only curative is intense logic and wisdom, which presumably counters the extreme irrationality the disease causes in its victims. First appearing during the Autobot-Decepticon wars (which necessitated the second resurrection of Optimus Prime), a relatively milder strain is seen again during the events of Beast Machines; Megatron triggers a pre-planted virus in Silverbolt, infecting him and the rest of the Maximals. The strain is cured, again, by intense logic and wisdom.

|Harvester Virus
|''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]:'' "[[Armageddon Game]]"
|Described as a "nanobiogenic weapon", the Harvesters were developed by the T'Lani and Kellerun from a small synthetic virus that was, itself, very lethal; the deadly and much feared weapon used during their centuries-long war killed by disrupting the victim's genetic structure, and had completely devastated the entire population of T'Lani III. So feared was this virus, that even after peace was made and the harvesters were disposed of in a ten-year project, the two governments secretly made plans to assassinate the scientists who worked on the project, fearing what might happen if they were ever remade.

|Hinamizawa Syndrome
|''[[List of When They Cry episodes|When They Cry/When The Cicadas Cry/Higurashi no Naku Koro ni]]''
|A mental disease similar to [[schizophrenia]]. It is often referred to as "The Curse of Oyashiro sama" by the townspeople who have no knowledge of the disease and instead relate it to a supposed curse on the town by its guardian god, Oyashiro sama.Through history the villagers imposed rules to prevent the populous from becoming "demons" or in reality, stopping the symptoms from progressing. It causes [[paranoia]]-inducing [[hallucinations]] which progressively grow more threatening as the victim becomes more paranoid. In the case of the character [[Keiichi Maebara]], it caused his friends' humored laughter to seem maniacal, and their tone of voice more threatening and sinister than it was. Eventually, he hallucinated a marker held by Mion Sonozaki to be a syringe, having heard that a murderer in the town was on drugs. This caused him to kill Mion, as well as Rena Ryuuguu, with a baseball bat. In most cases, the end result of the disease involves [[suicide]], which Keiichi did by clawing his throat out. Rena also once attempted suicide from the syndrome by cutting her wrist with a knife. It is revealed later in the series that Hanyuu, the incarnation of Oyashiro, was responsible for some of the paranoia, mostly that one is being watched or followed. However, the disease was still mostly psychological.

As a retrovirus, it contains both RNA and the reverse transcriptase enzyme, allowing it to insert its own genetic codes into living cells. It enters, re-purposes and changes the cell, replicating previously dormant non-coding segments of DNA. More often than not, these changes are too drastic and 99.99% of subjects die from massive organ failure and cell saturation.However some variants have yielded other beneficial results; endowing the infected organisms with incredible superhuman genetic prowess, that greatly increase their natural abilities to levels far exceeding human capability.

|-
|Creeping Derangea
|''[[Advance Wars: Days of Ruin]]''
|An artificial virus that is revealed to be a failed Bio-Weapon created by Dr. Caulder to test the extent of IDS technology. Due to its inherent flaw of photophobia, creeping derangea is only able to thrive when the sun was effectively blocked out by the vast amounts of dust that were kicked up into the troposphere and stratosphere by the apocalyptic meteor impact events. The Virus is initially only able to infect those under the age of 20 but a new strain is somehow introduced that can infect older hosts over time. Symptoms include headaches, paranoia, and a black diamond on the skin called "the mark". It causes flowers to grow inside a person and break out of the skin. A beautiful, albeit excruciatingly painful, way to die. Its scientific name is Endoflorescens terribilis. It is also known as The Creeper and the Green Thumb.

|''[[Fallen Earth]]''
|The SHIVA virus, or at least SHIVA I, is hinted to be an airborne virus with a quick infection exposure time, and therefore has qualities much like a modern chemical weapon. Overall the SHIVA virus appears as seven distinct forms, with naming conventions of SHIVA I through SHIVA VII, with the seventh version being mostly non-lethal. The virus is named after Shiva, the Hindu God of death due to the dance-like convulsions that it causes its victims
|-
|The Filth
|''[[The Secret World]]''
|A biological weapon willed into existence by the Dreamers in their attempts to free themselves from captivity, it manifests in a variety of forms, including poisonous gas, parasitic fungi, radio waves, and even words. The most common variant takes the form of a viscous black fluid. Exposure to the Filth results in nightmares, respiratory difficulties, paranoia, delusions, violent behavior, and eventual insanity; mutations gradually set in, resulting in victims manifesting glowing red eyes, tentacles, and exuding Filth from their skin. Sufferers ultimately fall under the influence of the Dreamers and are devoted either to releasing them from their prisons or continuing the spread of the disease. Further mutations may occur following this stage, and more exotic forms of the Filth can result in more unusual symptoms, one rare case transforming the victim into a [[Ghost|disembodied intelligence]] migrating between infected individuals. No cure exists.

|-
|Frenzy Virus
|''[[Monster Hunter 4]]''
|The Frenzy Virus is an infectious disease originating in monsters Gore Magala and Shagaru Magala. It is transmitted through the air via black mistlike particles, or through contact with an infected specimen. Symptoms of the Frenzy Virus in monsters include heightened aggression, increased physical prowess, and a significantly shortened lifespan. In rare cases, a sufficiently powerful monster can overcome the virus. Such monsters are referred to as Apex monsters, and they obtain a strengthened version of the benefits of the virus without the main drawbacks. Player controlled hunters can also be infected, which gives them a limited amount of time before the virus activates and temporarily removes their natural regeneration. It also makes attacks from Gore Magala, Chaotic Gore Magala (A Gore Magala that has not properly shed its skin and become Shagaru Magala) Shagaru Magala, or a frenzied monster much more lethal than normal.  If a hunter manages to show enough aggression before this activation occurs, they overcome the virus, avoiding all negative effects and gaining a short-term increase in physical ability.
|-
|G-Virus
|''[[Resident Evil 2]]''
|A [[mutagenic]] pathogen which causes the host to become a big, constantly evolving, practically unstoppable killing machine, with exceedingly high attack power and immense vitality, in addition to the ability to [[regeneration (biology)|regenerate]] and mutate so quickly the carrier virtually loses its mortality. The purified virus can be injected directly into the host, or a mutated host can implant a small [[larva]]e, called a G-embryo into another host. The latter mode of transmission is most successful when the host and the new victim are genetically similar. The virus would later be merged with the T-Virus by Umbrella scientists in an attempt to balance the G-virus' rapid evolution with the T-virus' stability, creating an extremely dangerous, [[electromagnetism|electromagnetic]]-capable variant called the T/G Virus.
|-

|Gangliated Utrophin Immuno Latency Toxin (GUILT)
|''[[Trauma Center: Under the Knife]]''
|A series of eight parasitic pathogens created by the medical-terrorist group Delphi. Despite its ingame introduction as a toxin, GUILT is referred as a "moving tumor", but behaves more like a parasite. During ingame sequences where the player operates on patients, GUILT diseases are normally shown as a pseudo-sentient core that attacks the patient from within, using lacerations, tumors and other ailments. Individual strains are named after Greek days of the week (Kyriaki, Deftera, Triti, Tetarti, Pempti, Paraskevi, Savato), the only exception being the eighth strain, called "Bliss". Neo-GUILT strains, which were developed independently from the original GUILT project, introduce four more strains (Nous, Bythos, Sige, Aletheia). Some GUILT survivors were also inflicted with a variation of the disease, dubbed the PGS (Post-GUILT syndrome).

|-
|"Harran Virus" (Previously Unknown)
|''[[Dying Light]]''
|A previously mysterious rabies-like pathogen, the Harran Virus was spread within the city of Harran (likely based in Turkey) to epidemic proportions, placing the city under quarantine. As a result, many victims of the virus are initially turned into aggressive and athletic infected (called "Virals") before decaying into hordes of shambling and cannibalistic infected (called "Biters"). With this said, some of those infected by the virus may mutate into various creatures. Once the sun goes down, the pathogen alters the infected's motor-coordination and sensory, resulting the sluggish infected turning agile and vicious at night (called "Night Walkers") and mutated inhuman infected (called "Volatiles") with severe muscle exposure coming out only at night to hunt any uninfected survivors. During the night, the infected's primary weakness is [[Ultraviolet]], while the infected during the day have no specified weakness.
|-
|Incuritis
|''[[Apollo Justice: Ace Attorney]]''
|A rare, but lethal disease, curable only through the use of a medicine made from the Borginian Cocoon. The cure is very difficult to make, and if made incorrectly, it is a deadly poison, and thus the exportation of such a cocoon is illegal. The Chief Justice's son is afflicted with the disease.

It appears the gas is transmittable through bites, and therefore contagious. In hallucinations, the gas is also shown to affect animals.
|-
|Rust Lung/Lambency
|''[[Gears of War 2]]''
|When the Lightmass bomb that killed the multitude of Locust monsters in [[Gears of War|the first game]] vaporized the liquid element "Imulsion", the gas seeped into the atmosphere of planet Sera, resulting in 'Rust Lung', a disease that spreads quickly and deadly. However, in [[Gears of War 3]] it is concluded that Imulsion is not just a fuel, it is a [[parasite]], and it began to spread to humans as it had to Locust. In fact, as the subterran Locust tried to escape being turned into infested "Lambent", they had to start the genocide of the surface-occupying humans. The Lambent organism is present to some degree in every human's cells by the events of the game, and 'rust lung' is a sing of approaching transformation into a "former human", or just Former, a [[zombie]]-like creature. Locust, however, appear not to lose sentience after transformation, and some of them develop uncanny mutations amidst the heat of battle. All Lambent inherit Imuslion's qualities: glow in the dark and explosive properties. The point of the third game is to deal with the Imulsion's assault on the surface of the planet.

|-
|Rosalia Virus
|''[[Trauma Team]]''
|A variation of viral hemorrhagic fever, capable of killing patients in days. The virus was originally found in the blood of Rosalia Rosselini by Cumberland College professor Albert Sartre. Sartre and his son attempted to use the virus to cure all disease, but instead found that it could not be used for positive means. An outbreak of the virus occurred, resulting in the Cumberland College Incident, where Sartre and Rosalia escaped to Mexico, and his son lost all memory of the incident, but was arrested and sentenced to 250 years of imprisonment under the ID "CR-S01". However, Sartre was inflicted with the virus, causing him to fall to insanity, killing Rosalia. Rosalia's blood splattered onto nearby flowers, which monarch butterflies fed upon, acting as vectors that caused a second outbreak. A variation of the Rosalia virus was encountered once, when one of the Rosalia patients, Naomi Kimishima, also had a pre-existing incurable genetic disease (thought to be related to GUILT). Interactions between the genetic disease and Rosalia gave birth to a "Twisted Rosalia" strain, which only one case was known to be documented.

|SCP 610
| [[SCP: Containment Breach]]
|A highly infectious skin disease which was first reported by the Russian government in the 1970s. The disease begins as a normal skin disease which irritates the infected, causing itching and bad skin. But then searing temperatures increase the infection and spread it through the body, causing skin to rot and mutate. Eventually the victim is covered from head to toe in infectious sores. The victim is then declared clinically dead and reanimates after a while, and will attempt to infect anyone else they encounter. The [[SCP Foundation]] have been trying to contain this disease, but they may be unsuccessful because of its fast contagion spread.

|A virus accidentally created by Markus Vaughn and Lloyd Wilkens. It is later used as a bioterror weapon by the group Parnassus. It comes in six strains, named after body parts it resembles or attacks (Cheir, Soma, Ops, Onyx, Brachion, Cardia). Unlike other pathogens, which store their genetic information in DNA, Stigma stores its genetic information in a film-like structure making it unique among pathogens. Due to the fact that Stigma originated from a lab rat with Culurium-based synthetic blood, a newly discovered mineral from the country of Culuruma, taking control of the mines that contain the mineral is necessary for the mass production of Stigma.
|-
|Syphon Filter
|''[[Syphon Filter (series)|Syphon Filter series]]''
|A bio-weapon that can be genetically programmable to terminate specific genotypes, killing only intended victims while leaving non-targeted parties alive''.'' Because it binds with each host's specific DNA, it does not possess a universal vaccine, and in order to cure it, one must know the specific genetic lock and key for each strain of the disease.
|-
|T-Abyss Virus
|''[[Resident Evil: Revelations]]''
|A variant of the T-Virus, designed by FBC CEO Morgan Lansdale to show the world the dangers of bio-weapons and increase his own personal power through use of the 'Veltro' terrorist group. The virus crates zombies and BOWs who are strongly linked with water, and have numerous aquatic features such as tentacles and crab-like shells. It is encountered in the game when 'Veltro' threaten to infect the world's oceans, hoping to exact revenge for the loss of much of their forces during the bio-terrorist attack on the floating techno-utopia Terragrigia. It is encountered during exploration of three research vessals, where it has transformed the crew and several sea creatures into zombies, mutants and Tyrants.
|-
|T-Veronica Virus
|''[[Resident Evil Code: Veronica]]''
|A powerful strain of the Progenitor Virus, created by combining it with a rare [[retrovirus]] found in the genetic make-up of ant queens, discovered by unstable scientific genius Alexia Ashford, the result of an advanced cloning experiment. It is encountered in ''[[Resident Evil Code: Veronica|Code: Veronica]]'', when it is being used by Alexia Ashford in her attempt to take control of the world. She experiments on her father, then on herself; her father is transformed into a terrifying monster, while she, going into hibernation after giving herself a dose of the Virus, manages to gain control over it and retain her personality and intelligence. She eventually becomes a dragonfly-like creature who has to be killed by [[Chris Redfield]]. It appears again in the 'Operation Javier' section of ''[[Resident Evil: Darkside Chronicles|Darkside Chronicles]]'', where it is being used by Javier Hidalgo to cure his daughter Manuela of an inherited illness. He also tried to cure his wife, but the virus overwhelmed her and turned her into a mutant. Manuela uses her developing powers (similar to Alexia Ashford's abilities before transforming into her insect form) to defeat the mutated Javier, and is then evacuated by [[Leon S. Kennedy|Leon Kennedy]] and [[Jack Krauser]]. If Manuela survives at the end of the game, it is said that she is cared for by the US government, but her ultimate fate is left unknown.
|-
|T-Virus
|''[[Resident Evil]]''
|(short for Tyrant Virus, after the humanoid BOWs it is used to create) A virus that causes [[dementia]] and cellular [[necrosis]] in humans, turning them into zombie-like creatures who are difficult to kill. It can easily mutate into other strains, some of which have mutagenic effects on the host. In insects or amphibians, the resulting mutation often involves increased [[aggression|aggressiveness]], increased size, and (almost always) the development of poisonous traits. In mammals, the results include aggressiveness, physiological changes of varying degrees, and an extremely increased evolutionary rate. However, it is shown that some humans can bond with the T-Virus and its variants and gain heightened speed, strength and strange powers while retaining their personalities, as in the case of [[Albert Wesker]] and [[Alexia Ashford]]. Variants include the [[Nemesis (Resident Evil)|NE-T virus]], [[T-G Virus]], the T-JCCC203 (used for pharmaceutical, but killed two people) and many others.

|''[[Dark Sector]]''
|The metabolism of victims are increased and the surface of their skin hardens and forms a metallic exterior. The infection continues to mutate the host, driving them insane from the intense pain. The infected then become wildly aggressive and unpredictable, attacking anyone that is not infected on sight. The disease can be spread by physical contact and can affect animals as well as humans.
|-
|Tiberium poisoning
|''[[Command &amp; Conquer]]''
|Tiberium crystals start to grow on a person's skin. These skin crystals eventually force their way through the persons vital organs, killing them. If the infestation is in a certain proportion, the victim mutates into a living bag of rotten skin and organs, called a visceroid.
|-
|Unicornitis
|''[[Octodad: Dadliest Catch]]''
|A disease made up during a story told by Tommy and Stacy in the bonus episode "Medical Mess". Symptoms include a bright pink unicorn horn magically sprouting from the forehead, and the ability to fly. The only known cure is to purchase and use a set of jet-skis. Notable victims include Patient 203 and Octodad.
|-
|Uroboros
|''[[Resident Evil 5]]''
|An advanced strain of the Progenitor virus, the Uroboros virus was created by Albert Wesker, with inadvertent help from Jill Valentine. Exposure to Uroboros can lead to one of two things—forced evolution via DNA integration, leading to extremely heightened abilities, or rejection via the virus, leading to the parasitic nature taking over and forming a mass of black, leech-like pustules, which can grow in size if exposed to more organic matters. The only individual known to survive the process was Albert Wesker, which was more than likely due to the fact of his previous exposure to the T-virus. Other beings that took positive mutations from the Uroboros virus include the Reapers; cockroaches exposed accidentally to the virus, who then in turn grew largely in size, gained armour-like carapaces and scythe-like appendages, explaining the name.
|-
|Wailing Death
|''[[Neverwinter Nights]]''
|A bubonic-like plague that infects almost the entire city of Neverwinter. Thought to be just a natural plague, it is later discovered that it was magically created and unleashed upon the city.
|-
|(Unknown)
|''[[Madworld]]''
|A disease created by the Organizers to force innocent people to compete in the bloodsport ''Deathwatch'' for an antidote.
|-
|X-2 Virus
|''[[BattleTanx]]'', ''[[BattleTanx: Global Assault]]''
|An extremely deadly virus released in 2001 and further researched in 2006 that killed 99.9% of the world's human female population that did not possess a special psychic ability known as 'The Edge'.  Those that were spared were treated with the utmost respect, authority, and loyalty, thereby earning their title of 'Queenlord'.
|-
|Yellow Death
|''[[Ben Croshaw#1213 series|1213]]''
|A deadly virus which contaminated the entire planet Earth and certain parts of the Tessa Life Orbital. Humans are killed in short time upon infection, but cloned humans are transformed into killer zombies. When 0916 got a large dosage of the virus he mutated into a yellow, four-armed monster with two retractable spines and tentacles. 1213 however was unaffected by the virus due to a successful [[Immunization]] to the virus.
|-
|Twin Fever
|''[[Metroid Prime]]''
|A Virus native to Twin Tabula causing double vision. When the twin sight fades, the victim is near death.
|-
|''Kuru'' {{clarify|date=July 2015}}
|''[[Dead Island]], [[Dead Island: Riptide|Dead Island Riptide]]'', ''[[Dead Island 2]]''
| Is a sub-type version of Kuru which later actually revealing is neuro-genetically engineered version of Kuru that infected islands to the Papua New Guinea region. It is widely passed among the local tribes and is believed to be the cause of the zombie outbreak. Doctor West needs a non-mutated strain of this disease to work on a cure. Doctor West also believes that people with O Negative blood are unsusceptible to the infection

|-
|Goblin Fever
|''[[Dungeon Adventures]] #46'', "Goblin Fever"
|This disease is a relatively harmless ailment to goblins, orcs, and similar creatures, but it's rare. To humans, it's much deadlier. Having a long incubation period and being highly contagious, an outbreak can start before the first case is even detected. The disease causes deterioration of the central nervous system, causing forgetfulness and rapid mood swings, the victim often becoming violent, depressed, or even suicidal, eventually lapsing into a coma before dying.
|-
|Free League Plague
|''[[Planescape]]''
|A plague created by the [[Lady of Pain]] to keep the swelling numbers of the Free League in check, which grew to an overwhelming size after a conflict called the Great Upheaval amongst the factions, where the Lady of Pain decreed that there could only be fifteen Factions in Sigil at one time. Very little is known about this disease, but any member of the Free League stood a chance of becoming infected with it simply by entering Sigil.
|-
|Magical Diseases
|''[[Dungeons and Dragons]]''
|The setting has several of varying degrees of lethality, most of them affecting one or more Ability Scores. The most well known are Devil Chills, Cackle Fever, Filth Fever, Mummy Rot, and Slimy Doom.
|-
|Slarecian Language Virus
|''[[Scarred Lands]]''
|This odd affliction can infect anyone who tries to use magic or even rudimentary means to decipher the language of the Slarecian, an extinct species of evil sorcerers, if the work they are trying to decipher has this specific taint. An infected victim's language is changed to that of the Slarecians (which is gibberish to most natives of Scarn), meaning he can only understand or be understood by another infected victim, and all written language other than Slarecian makes no sense to him. Victims do not realize what has happened to them, as what they say sounds clear to them. The disease is incredibly contagious; anyone who listens to an infected victim risks also becoming infected. 
|-
|Ravenloft Viruses
|''[[Ravenloft]] Monstrous Compendium Appendix III: Creatures of Darkness''
|Theses six incredibly lethal magical diseases were created by an evil wizard who was killed by his six sons, who each became the first carrier of one of them: Combustion (the victim experiences a horrible fever and eventually bursts into flames), Crystal (the victim's blood starts to crystallize from within), Petrification (the victim gradually turns to stone) Phobia (the victim becomes terrified of everything), Psionic (the victim rapidly gains intelligence and psionic powers until his head explodes) and Shadow (the victim eventually fades into darkness). Each disease is very contagious, especially from the remains of a dead victim.
|-
|Vile Diseases
|''[[Book of Vile Darkness]]''
|The book mentions seventeen diseases of varying lethality caused by evil magic or exposure to focal points of incredible evil. The most notorious ones are Faceless Hate (causes the victim's face to vanish, and drives him to a violent, insane rage), Life Blindness (the victim is unable to see, hear, or otherwise perceive any other living things, and is often driven mad from isolation and loneliness), and Vile Rigidity (the victim becomes stronger and tougher, but eventually, his skin hardens, until he can't move and suffocates).
|-
|Knahaten Flu
|''[[The Elder Scrolls]]''
|The Knahaten Flu (also known as the Knahaten Plague) was one of the deadliest diseases to infect the populace of Tamriel, lasting for 43 years. Though exactly how the disease was introduced is unknown, it started in the swamps of Black Marsh. Argonians, the denizens of Black Marsh, were immune to the disease, leading to speculation about its source, but it did not take long for it to sweep through the rest of the continent. There is no definitive death toll of the disease. However, the Flu almost completely destroyed the non-Argonian population of Black Marsh, and killed vast swathes of the population of Tamriel. The exact method of transmission is unclear. Early symptoms of the Flu include "general malaise, loss of appetite, and fatigue," followed shortly by aching muscles, sharp pain in the shoulders, chills, and watering eyes. Late-stage symptoms include wracking cough, high fever, and blood flowing out of the nose, eyes and eventually the mouth. Victims rarely survived longer than a few days.
|-
|Virally-Induced Toxic Allergy Syndrome (VITAS)
|''[[Shadowrun]]''
|Caused by a highly lethal and communicable airborne virus, VITAS is the disease responsible for many of the changes that led to what became the Sixth World in the Shadowrun universe, having killed a quarter of the world's population after its outbreak in 2011. A second strain (VITAS II) broke out in the 2020s, killing an additional 10%. Symptoms begin 12 hours after infection and begin with symptoms similar to influenza before developing into severe anaphylaxis leading to death usually by the airways swelling shut. Though treatable with modern drugs, at the initial outbreak of VITAS over 75% of the world's population became infected before a cure was discovered.
|-
|White Fever
|''[[Ravenloft]]'' 
|A disease that is usually unique to the Core Domain of Valachan. Symptoms include weakness, exhaustion, chills, and loss of strength. Magical remedies cannot cure it, but conventional medicine can hasten recovery. In truth, "white fever" is one of many hoaxes orchestrated by Valachan's ruler, Baron Urik von Kharkov, in order to hide his true nature from his subjects. The illness is actually caused by the vampiric feeding of the Baron and his servants.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="86436">This article documents '''the most distant astronomical objects''' so far discovered, and the time periods in which they were so classified.

Distances to remote objects, other than those in nearby galaxies, are nearly always inferred by measuring the [[cosmological redshift]] of their light. By their nature, very distant objects tend to be very faint, and these distance determinations are difficult and subject to errors. An important distinction is whether the distance is determined via [[spectroscopy]] or using a [[photometric redshift]] technique. The former is generally both more precise and also more reliable, in the sense that photometric redshifts are more prone to being wrong due to confusion with lower redshift sources that have unusual spectra. For that reason, a spectroscopic redshift is conventionally regarded as being necessary for an object's distance to be considered definitely known, whereas photometrically determined redshifts identify "candidate" very distant sources. Here, this distinction is indicated by a "p" subscript for photometric redshifts.

==Timeline of most distant astronomical object recordholders==
Objects in this list were found to be the most distant object at the time of determination of their distance. This is frequently not the same as the date of their discovery.

Distances to astronomical objects may be determined through [[parallax]] measurements, use of [[standard candles|standard references]] such as [[cepheid variable]]s or [[Type Ia supernova]]s, or [[redshift]] measurement. [[Astronomical spectroscopy#Doppler effect and redshift|Spectroscopic redshift]] measurement is preferred, while [[photometric redshift]] measurement is also used to identify candidate high redshift sources. The symbol ''z'' represents redshift.

&lt;!-- this table contains a successive list of the absolute most distant object titleholder --&gt;

==List of objects by year of discovery that turned out to be most distant==
This list contains a list of most distant objects by year of discovery of the object, not the determination of its distance. Objects may have been discovered without distance determination, and were found subsequently to be the most distant known at that time. However, object must have been named or described. An object like [[OJ 287]] is ignored even though it was detected as early as 1891 using photographic plates, but ignored until the advent of radiotelescopes.

'''Manhattan Project National Historical Park''' is a United States [[National Historical Park]] commemorating the [[Manhattan Project]] that is run jointly by the [[National Park Service]] and [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]]. The park consists of three units: one in [[Oak Ridge, Tennessee]], one in [[Los Alamos, New Mexico]] and one in [[Hanford, Washington]]. It was established on November 10, 2015 when [[United States Secretary of the Interior|Secretary of the Interior]] [[Sally Jewell]] and [[Secretary of Energy]] [[Ernest Moniz]] signed the [[memorandum of agreement]] that defined the roles that the two agencies had when managing the park.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Interior and Energy Departments Formally Establish the Manhattan Project National Historical Park|url=https://www.energy.gov/articles/interior-and-energy-departments-formally-establish-manhattan-project-national-historical-0|publisher=Department of Energy|accessdate=12 November 2015|date=November 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Celebrations in Oak Ridge for Manhattan Project park|url=http://www.wbir.com/story/news/local/2015/11/10/memorandum-establish-manhattan-project-national-park/75505574/|publisher=WBIR|accessdate=12 November 2015|date=November 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Department of Energy had owned and managed most of the properties located within the three different sites. For over ten years, the DoE worked with the National Park Service and federal, state and local governments and agencies with the intention of turning places of importance into a National Historical Park. After several years of surveying the three sites and five other possible alternatives, the two agencies officially recommended a historical park be established in Hanford, Los Alamos and Oak Ridge. The Department of Energy would continue to manage and own the sites while the National Park Service would provide interpretive services, visitor centers and park rangers. After two unsuccessful attempts at passing a bill in Congress authorizing the park in 2012 and 2013, the House and Senate ultimately passed the bill in December 2014, with [[President Obama]] signing the National Defense Authorization Act shortly thereafter which authorized the Manhattan Project National Historical Park.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Making of a National Park|url=https://www.energy.gov/management/making-national-park|publisher=Department of Energy|accessdate=12 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Congress Passes Manhattan Project National Historical Park Act|url=http://www.atomicheritage.org/article/congress-passes-manhattan-project-national-historical-park-act|publisher=Atomic Heritage Foundation|accessdate=12 November 2015|date=December 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mathematical morphology''' ('''MM''') is a theory and technique for the analysis and processing of geometrical structures, based on [[set theory]], [[lattice theory]], [[topology]], and [[random function]]s. MM is most commonly applied to [[digital image]]s, but it can be employed as well on [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graphs]], [[polygon mesh|surface meshes]], [[Solid geometry|solids]], and many other spatial structures.

[[Topology|Topological]] and [[Geometry|geometrical]] [[continuum (theory)|continuous]]-space concepts such as size, [[shape]], [[convex set|convexity]], [[Connectedness|connectivity]], and [[geodesic distance]], were introduced by MM on both continuous and [[discrete space]]s. MM is also the foundation of morphological [[image processing]], which consists of a set of operators that transform images according to the above characterizations.

The basic morphological operators are [[Erosion (morphology)|erosion]], [[Dilation (morphology)|dilation]], [[Opening (morphology)|opening]] and [[Closing (morphology)|closing]].

MM was originally developed for [[binary image]]s, and was later extended to [[grayscale]] [[Function (mathematics)|functions]] and images. The subsequent generalization to [[complete lattice]]s is widely accepted today as MM's theoretical foundation.

== History ==

Ever since the 1960s, all sorts of schemes for nonlinear processing of images have been discussed and used in particular communities. An example originally popular in the earth and environmental sciences is mathematical morphology, based on "dilation" of data consisting of 0's and 1's with a "structuring element" σ according to Sign[ListConvolve[σ, data, 1, 0]] (as well as the dual operation of "erosion").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wolfram|first=Stephen|title=A New Kind of Science|publisher=Wolfram Media, Inc.|year=2002|page=1077|isbn=1-57955-008-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mathematical Morphology was developed 1964 by the collaborative work of [[Georges Matheron]] and [[Jean Serra]], at the ''[[École des Mines de Paris]]'', [[France]]. Matheron supervised the [[PhD]] [[thesis]] of Serra, devoted to the quantification of mineral characteristics from thin [[Cross section (geometry)|cross section]]s, and this work resulted in a novel practical approach, as well as theoretical advancements in [[integral geometry]] and [[topology]].

In 1968, the ''[[Centre de Morphologie Mathématique]]'' was founded by the École des Mines de Paris in [[Fontainebleau]], France, led by Matheron and Serra.

During the rest of the 1960s and most of the 1970s, MM dealt essentially with [[binary image]]s, treated as [[Set (mathematics)|sets]], and generated a large number of [[binary operator]]s and techniques: [[Hit-or-miss transform]], [[Dilation (morphology)|dilation]], [[Erosion (morphology)|erosion]], [[opening (morphology)|opening]], [[closing (morphology)|closing]], [[Granulometry (morphology)|granulometry]], [[Hit-or-miss transform#Thinning|thinning]], [[Topological skeleton|skeletonization]], [[ultimate erosion]], [[conditional bisector]], and others. A random approach was also developed, based on novel image models. Most of the work in that period was developed in Fontainebleau.

From the mid-1970s to mid-1980s, MM was generalized to [[grayscale]] functions and [[image]]s as well. Besides extending the main concepts (such as dilation, erosion, etc.) to functions, this generalization yielded new operators, such as [[Morphological Gradient|morphological gradients]], [[top-hat transform]] and the [[Watershed (algorithm)|Watershed]] (MM's main [[Segmentation (image processing)|segmentation]] approach).

In the 1980s and 1990s, MM gained a wider recognition, as research centers in several countries began to adopt and investigate the method. MM started to be applied to a large number of imaging problems and applications.

In 1986, Serra further generalized MM, this time to a theoretical framework based on [[complete lattice]]s. This generalization brought flexibility to the theory, enabling its application to a much larger number of structures, including color images, video, [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graphs]], [[Mesh (mathematics)|mesh]]es, etc. At the same time, Matheron and Serra also formulated a theory for morphological [[Filter (mathematics)|filtering]], based on the new lattice framework.

The 1990s and 2000s also saw further theoretical advancements, including the concepts of ''[[connection (morphology)|connections]]'' and ''[[leveling (morphology)|levelings]]''.

In 1993, the first International Symposium on Mathematical Morphology (ISMM) took place in [[Barcelona]], [[Spain]]. Since then, ISMMs are organized every 2–3 years: [[Fontainebleau]], [[France]] (1994); [[Atlanta]], [[United States of America|USA]] (1996); [[Amsterdam]], [[Netherlands]] (1998); [[Palo Alto]], [[California|CA]], [[United States of America|USA]] (2000); [[Sydney]], [[Australia]] (2002); [[Paris]], [[France]] (2005); [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Brazil]] (2007); [[Groningen (city)|Groningen]], [[Netherlands]] (2009); Intra ([[Verbania]]), [[Italy]] (2011); [[Uppsala]], Sweden (2013); [[Reykjavik]], Iceland (2015); and [[Fontainebleau]], [[France]] (2017).

== Binary morphology ==

In binary morphology, an image is viewed as a [[subset]] of a [[Euclidean space]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^d&lt;/math&gt; or the integer grid &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}^d&lt;/math&gt;, for some dimension ''d''.

=== Structuring element ===

The basic idea in binary morphology is to probe an image with a simple, pre-defined shape, drawing conclusions on how this shape fits or misses the shapes in the image. This simple "probe" is called the [[structuring element]], and is itself a binary image (i.e., a subset of the space or grid).

Here are some examples of widely used structuring elements (denoted by ''B''):

* Let &lt;math&gt;E=\mathbb{R}^2&lt;/math&gt;; ''B'' is an open disk of radius ''r'', centered at the origin.
* Let &lt;math&gt;E=\mathbb{Z}^2&lt;/math&gt;; ''B'' is a 3x3 square, that is, ''B''={(-1,-1), (-1,0), (-1,1), (0,-1), (0,0), (0,1), (1,-1), (1,0), (1,1)}.
* Let &lt;math&gt;E=\mathbb{Z}^2&lt;/math&gt;; ''B'' is the "cross" given by: ''B''={(-1,0), (0,-1), (0,0), (0,1), (1,0)}.

=== Basic operators ===
The basic operations are shift-invariant ([[Translational invariance|translation invariant]]) operators strongly related to [[Minkowski addition]].

Let ''E'' be a Euclidean space or an integer grid, and ''A'' a binary image in ''E''.

==== Erosion ====

[[File:Erosion.png|thumb|right|The erosion of the dark-blue square by a disk, resulting in the light-blue square.]]
The [[Erosion (morphology)|erosion]] of the binary image ''A'' by the structuring element ''B'' is defined by:

::&lt;math&gt;A \ominus B = \{z\in E | B_{z} \subseteq A\}&lt;/math&gt;,

where ''B''&lt;sub&gt;''z''&lt;/sub&gt; is the translation of ''B'' by the vector ''z'', i.e., &lt;math&gt;B_z = \{b+z|b\in B\}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\forall z\in E&lt;/math&gt;.

When the structuring element ''B'' has a center (e.g., ''B'' is a disk or a square), and this center is located on the origin of ''E'', then the erosion of ''A'' by ''B'' can be understood as the [[Locus (mathematics)|locus]] of points reached by the center of ''B'' when ''B'' moves inside ''A''. For example, the erosion of a square of side 10, centered at the origin, by a disc of radius 2, also centered at the origin, is a square of side 6 centered at the origin.

The erosion of ''A'' by ''B'' is also given by the expression: &lt;math&gt;A  \ominus B = \bigcap_{b\in B} A_{-b}&lt;/math&gt;.

Example application: Assume we have received a fax of  a dark photocopy. Everything looks like it was written with a pen that is bleeding. Erosion process will allow thicker lines to get skinny and detect the hole inside the letter "o".

==== Dilation ====

[[File:Dilation.png|thumb|right|The dilation of the dark-blue square by a disk, resulting in the light-blue square with rounded corners.]]

The [[Dilation (morphology)|dilation]] of ''A'' by the structuring element ''B'' is defined by:

::&lt;math&gt;A  \oplus B = \bigcup_{b\in B} A_b&lt;/math&gt;.

The dilation is commutative, also given by: &lt;math&gt;A  \oplus B = B\oplus A = \bigcup_{a\in A} B_a&lt;/math&gt;.

If ''B'' has a center on the origin, as before, then the dilation of ''A'' by ''B'' can be understood as the locus of the points covered by ''B'' when the center of ''B'' moves inside ''A''. In the above example, the dilation of the square of side 10 by the disk of radius 2 is a square of side 14, with rounded corners, centered at the origin. The radius of the rounded corners is 2.

The dilation can also be obtained by: &lt;math&gt;A  \oplus B = \{z \in E| (B^{s})_{z} \cap A\neq \varnothing\}&lt;/math&gt;, where ''B''&lt;sup&gt;''s''&lt;/sup&gt; denotes the [[rotational symmetry|symmetric]] of ''B'', that is, &lt;math&gt;B^{s}=\{x\in E | -x \in B\}&lt;/math&gt;.

Example application: Dilation is the dual operation of the erosion. Figures that are very lightly drawn get thick when "dilated". Easiest way to describe it is to imagine the same fax/text is written with a thicker pen.

==== Opening ====

[[File:Opening.png|thumb|right|The opening of the dark-blue square by a disk, resulting in the light-blue square with round corners.]]

The [[Opening (morphology)|opening]] of ''A'' by ''B'' is obtained by the erosion of ''A'' by ''B'', followed by dilation of the resulting image by ''B'':

::&lt;math&gt;A \circ B  = (A \ominus B) \oplus B &lt;/math&gt;.

The opening is also given by &lt;math&gt;A \circ B = \bigcup_{B_x\subseteq A} B_x&lt;/math&gt;, which means that it is the locus of translations of the structuring element ''B'' inside the image ''A''. In the case of the square of side 10, and a disc of radius 2 as the structuring element, the opening is a square of side 10 with rounded corners, where the corner radius is 2.

Example application: Let's assume someone has written a note on a non-soaking paper and that the writing looks as if it is growing tiny hairy roots all over. Opening essentially removes the outer tiny "hairline" leaks and restores the text. The side effect is that it rounds off things. The sharp edges start to disappear.

==== Closing ====

[[File:Closing.png|thumb|right|The closing of the dark-blue shape (union of two squares) by a disk, resulting in the union of the dark-blue shape and the light-blue areas.]]

The [[Closing (morphology)|closing]] of ''A'' by ''B'' is obtained by the dilation of ''A'' by ''B'', followed by erosion of the resulting structure by ''B'':

::&lt;math&gt;A \bullet B  = (A \oplus B) \ominus B &lt;/math&gt;.

The closing can also be obtained by &lt;math&gt;A \bullet B = (A^{c} \circ B^{s})^{c}&lt;/math&gt;, where ''X''&lt;sup&gt;''c''&lt;/sup&gt; denotes the [[complement (set theory)|complement]] of ''X'' relative to ''E'' (that is, &lt;math&gt;X^{c}=\{x\in E | x\not \in X\}&lt;/math&gt;). The above means that the closing is the complement of the locus of translations of the symmetric of the structuring element outside the image ''A''.

==== Properties of the basic operators ====

Here are some properties of the basic binary morphological operators (dilation, erosion, opening and closing):

* They are [[Translational invariance|translation invariant]].
* They are [[increasing]], that is, if &lt;math&gt;A\subseteq C&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;A\oplus B \subseteq C\oplus B&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;A\ominus B \subseteq C\ominus B&lt;/math&gt;, etc.
* The dilation is [[commutative]]: &lt;math&gt;A\oplus B = B\oplus A&lt;/math&gt; .
* If the origin of ''E'' belongs to the structuring element ''B'', then &lt;math&gt;A\ominus B\subseteq A\circ B\subseteq A\subseteq A\bullet B\subseteq A\oplus B&lt;/math&gt;.
* The dilation is [[associative]], i.e., &lt;math&gt;(A\oplus B)\oplus C = A\oplus (B\oplus C)&lt;/math&gt;. Moreover, the erosion satisfies &lt;math&gt;(A\ominus B)\ominus C = A\ominus (B\oplus C)&lt;/math&gt;.
* Erosion and dilation satisfy the duality &lt;math&gt;A \oplus B = (A^{c} \ominus B^{s})^{c}&lt;/math&gt;.
* Opening and closing satisfy the duality &lt;math&gt;A \bullet B = (A^{c} \circ B^{s})^{c}&lt;/math&gt;.
* The dilation is [[Distributive property|distributive]] over [[set union]]
* The erosion is [[Distributive property|distributive]] over [[set intersection]]
* The dilation is a [[pseudo-inverse]] of the erosion, and vice versa, in the following sense: &lt;math&gt;A\subseteq (C\ominus B)&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;(A\oplus B)\subseteq C&lt;/math&gt;.
* Opening and closing are [[idempotent]].
* Opening is [[anti-extensive]], i.e., &lt;math&gt;A\circ B\subseteq A&lt;/math&gt;, whereas the closing is ''extensive'', i.e., &lt;math&gt;A\subseteq A\bullet B&lt;/math&gt;.

==Grayscale morphology==

[[File:Watershed of gradient of MRI heart image.png|thumb|right|Watershed of the gradient of the cardiac image]]

In [[grayscale]] morphology, images are [[Function (mathematics)|functions]] mapping a [[Euclidean space]] or grid ''E'' into &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}\cup\{\infty,-\infty\}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; is the set of [[real numbers|reals]], &lt;math&gt;\infty&lt;/math&gt; is an element larger than any real number, and &lt;math&gt;-\infty&lt;/math&gt; is an element smaller than any real number.

Grayscale structuring elements are also functions of the same format, called "structuring functions".

Denoting an image by ''f(x)'' and the structuring function by ''b(x)'', the grayscale dilation of ''f'' by ''b'' is given by

::&lt;math&gt;(f\oplus b)(x)=\sup_{y\in E}[f(y)+b(x-y)]&lt;/math&gt;,

where "sup" denotes the [[supremum]].

Similarly, the erosion of ''f'' by ''b'' is given by

::&lt;math&gt;(f\ominus b)(x)=\inf_{y\in E}[f(y)-b(y-x)]&lt;/math&gt;,

where "inf" denotes the [[infimum]].

Just like in binary morphology, the opening and closing are given respectively by

::&lt;math&gt;f\circ b=(f\ominus b)\oplus b&lt;/math&gt;, and

::&lt;math&gt;f\bullet b=(f\oplus b)\ominus b&lt;/math&gt;.

===Flat structuring functions===

It is common to use flat structuring elements in morphological applications. Flat structuring functions are functions ''b(x)'' in the form

::&lt;math&gt;b(x)=\left\{\begin{array}{ll}0,&amp;x\in B,\\-\infty,&amp;\mbox{otherwise}\end{array}\right.&lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt;B\subseteq E&lt;/math&gt;.

In this case, the dilation and erosion are greatly simplified, and given respectively by

::&lt;math&gt;(f\oplus b)(x)=\sup_{z\in B^{s}}f(x+z)&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;!--See demonstration at [[Dilation_(morphology)#Flat_structuring_functions]]--&gt; and

::&lt;math&gt;(f\ominus b)(x)=\inf_{z\in B}f(x+z)&lt;/math&gt;.

In the bounded, discrete case (''E'' is a grid and ''B'' is bounded), the [[supremum]] and [[infimum]] operators can be replaced by the [[maximum]] and [[minimum]]. Thus, dilation and erosion are particular cases of [[order statistics]] filters, with dilation returning the maximum value within a moving window (the symmetric of the structuring function support ''B''), and the erosion returning the minimum value within the moving window ''B''.

In the case of flat structuring element, the morphological operators depend only on the relative ordering of [[pixel]] values, regardless their numerical values, and therefore are especially suited to the processing of [[binary images]] and [[grayscale images]] whose [[light transfer function]] is not known.

=== Other operators and tools ===

* [[Morphological Gradient]]s
* [[Top-hat transform]]
* [[Watershed (algorithm)|Watershed algorithm]]

By combining these operators one can obtain algorithms for many image processing tasks, such as [[feature extraction|feature detection]], [[segmentation (image processing)|image segmentation]], [[Unsharp masking|image sharpening]], [[Filter (signal processing)|image filtering]], and [[Statistical classification|classification]].
Along this line one should also look into [[Continuous Morphology]] &lt;ref&gt;G. Sapiro, R. Kimmel, D. Shaked, B. Kimia, and A. M. Bruckstein.  [http://www.cs.technion.ac.il/~ron/PAPERS/morphology_1993.pdf ''Implementing continuous-scale morphology via curve evolution'']. Pattern Recognition, 26(9):1363-1372, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mathematical morphology on complete lattices==

[[Complete lattice]]s are [[partially ordered set]]s, where every subset has an [[infimum]] and a [[supremum]]. In particular, it contains a [[least element]] and a [[greatest element]] (also denoted "universe").

===Adjunctions (Dilation and Erosion)===

Let &lt;math&gt;(L,\leq)&lt;/math&gt; be a complete lattice, with infimum and supremum symbolized by &lt;math&gt;\wedge&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\vee&lt;/math&gt;, respectively. Its universe and least element are symbolized by ''U'' and &lt;math&gt;\emptyset&lt;/math&gt;, respectively. Moreover, let &lt;math&gt;\{ X_{i} \}&lt;/math&gt; be a collection of elements from ''L''.

A dilation is any operator &lt;math&gt;\delta\colon L\rightarrow L&lt;/math&gt; that distributes over the supremum, and preserves the least element. I.e.:
* &lt;math&gt;\bigvee_{i}\delta(X_i)=\delta\left(\bigvee_{i} X_i\right)&lt;/math&gt;,
* &lt;math&gt;\delta(\emptyset)=\emptyset&lt;/math&gt;.

An erosion is any operator &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon\colon L\rightarrow L&lt;/math&gt; that distributes over the infimum, and preserves the universe. I.e.:
* &lt;math&gt;\bigwedge_{i}\varepsilon(X_i)=\varepsilon\left(\bigwedge_{i} X_i\right)&lt;/math&gt;,
* &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon(U)=U&lt;/math&gt;.

Dilations and erosions form [[Galois connection]]s. That is, for every dilation &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; there is one and only one erosion &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; that satisfies

::&lt;math&gt;X\leq \varepsilon(Y)\Leftrightarrow \delta(X)\leq Y&lt;/math&gt;

for all &lt;math&gt;X,Y\in L&lt;/math&gt;.

Similarly, for every erosion there is one and only one dilation satisfying the above connection.

Furthermore, if two operators satisfy the connection, then &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; must be a dilation, and &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; an erosion.

Pairs of erosions and dilations satisfying the above connection are called "adjunctions", and the erosion is said to be the adjoint erosion of the dilation, and vice versa.

===Opening and Closing===

For every adjunction &lt;math&gt;(\varepsilon,\delta)&lt;/math&gt;, the morphological opening &lt;math&gt;\gamma\colon L\rightarrow L&lt;/math&gt; and morphological closing &lt;math&gt;\phi\colon L\rightarrow L&lt;/math&gt; are defined as follows:

::&lt;math&gt;\gamma = \delta\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;, and

::&lt;math&gt;\phi = \varepsilon\delta&lt;/math&gt;.

The morphological opening and closing are particular cases of [[algebraic opening]] (or simply opening) and [[algebraic closing]] (or simply closing). Algebraic openings are operators in ''L'' that are idempotent, increasing, and anti-extensive. Algebraic closings are operators in ''L'' that are idempotent, increasing, and extensive.

===Particular cases===

Binary morphology is a particular case of lattice morphology, where ''L'' is the [[power set]] of ''E'' (Euclidean space or grid), that is, ''L'' is the set of all subsets of ''E'', and &lt;math&gt;\leq&lt;/math&gt; is the [[set inclusion]]. In this case, the infimum is [[set intersection]], and the supremum is [[set union]].

Similarly, grayscale morphology is another particular case, where ''L'' is the set of functions mapping ''E'' into &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}\cup\{\infty,-\infty\}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\leq&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\vee&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\wedge&lt;/math&gt;, are the point-wise order, supremum, and infimum, respectively. That is, is ''f'' and ''g'' are functions in ''L'', then &lt;math&gt;f\leq g&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;f(x)\leq g(x),\forall x\in E&lt;/math&gt;; the infimum &lt;math&gt;f\wedge g&lt;/math&gt; is given by &lt;math&gt;(f\wedge g)(x)=f(x)\wedge g(x)&lt;/math&gt;; and the supremum &lt;math&gt;f\vee g&lt;/math&gt; is given by &lt;math&gt;(f\vee g)(x)=f(x)\vee g(x)&lt;/math&gt;.

In [[control theory]], the '''minimum energy control''' is the control &lt;math&gt;u(t)&lt;/math&gt; that will bring a [[linear time invariant]] system to a desired state with a minimum expenditure of energy.

Let the linear time invariant (LTI) system be
: &lt;math&gt;\dot{\mathbf{x}}(t) = A \mathbf{x}(t) + B \mathbf{u}(t)&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{y}(t) = C \mathbf{x}(t) + D \mathbf{u}(t)&lt;/math&gt;
with initial state &lt;math&gt; x(t_0)=x_0 &lt;/math&gt;.  One seeks an input &lt;math&gt; u(t) &lt;/math&gt; so that the system will be in the state &lt;math&gt;x_1&lt;/math&gt; at time &lt;math&gt;t_1&lt;/math&gt;, and for any other input &lt;math&gt;\bar{u}(t)&lt;/math&gt;, which also drives the system from &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;x_1&lt;/math&gt; at time &lt;math&gt;t_1&lt;/math&gt;, the energy expenditure would be larger, i.e., 

:&lt;math&gt; \int_{t_0}^{t_1} \bar{u}^*(t) \bar{u}(t) dt \ \geq  \ \int_{t_0}^{t_1} u^*(t) u(t) dt. &lt;/math&gt;

To choose this input, first compute the [[controllability Gramian]]

:&lt;math&gt; W_c(t)=\int_{t_0}^t e^{A(t-\tau)}BB^*e^{A^*(t-\tau)} d\tau.&lt;/math&gt;

Assuming  &lt;math&gt;W_c&lt;/math&gt; is nonsingular (if and only if the system is controllable), the minimum energy control is then

:&lt;math&gt; u(t) = -B^*e^{A^*(t_1-t)}W_c^{-1}(t_1)[e^{A(t_1-t_0)}x_0-x_1].&lt;/math&gt;

Substitution into the solution

:&lt;math&gt;x(t)=e^{A(t-t_0)}x_0+\int_{t_0}^{t}e^{A(t-\tau)}Bu(\tau)d\tau&lt;/math&gt;

verifies the achievement of state &lt;math&gt;x_1&lt;/math&gt; at &lt;math&gt;t_1&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Multiphoton lithography''' (also known as '''direct laser lithography''' or '''direct laser writing''') of [[polymer]] templates has been known for years{{Clarify timeframe|date=August 2016}} by the [[photonic crystal]] community. Similar to standard [[photolithography]] techniques, structuring is accomplished by illuminating negative-tone or positive-tone [[photoresist]]s via light of a well-defined wavelength. The fundamental difference is, however, the avoidance of [[reticle]]s. Instead, [[two-photon absorption]] is utilized to induce a dramatic change in the solubility of the resist for appropriate developers.

Hence, multiphoton lithography is a technique for creating small features in a [[photosensitive]] material, without the use of complex [[optics|optical]] systems or [[photomask]]s. This method relies on a multi-photon absorption process in a material that is transparent at the wavelength of the [[laser]] used for creating the pattern. By scanning and properly modulating the laser, a chemical change (usually [[polymerization]]) occurs at the focal spot of the laser and can be controlled to create an arbitrary three-dimensional periodic or non-periodic pattern. This method has been used for [[rapid prototyping]] of structures with fine features.

[[Two-photon absorption]] is a third-order with respect to the [[Nonlinear optics|third-order optical susceptibility]] &lt;math&gt;\chi^{(3)}&lt;/math&gt; and a [[Two-photon absorption|second-order process with respect to light intensity]]. For this reason it is a non-linear process several orders of magnitude weaker than linear absorption, thus very high light intensities are required to increase the number of such rare events. For example, tightly-focused laser beams provide the needed intensities. Here, pulsed laser sources are preferred as they deliver high-intensity pulses while depositing a relatively low average energy. To enable 3D structuring, the light source must be adequately adapted to the photoresist in that single-photon absorption is highly suppressed while two-photon absorption is favoured. This condition is met if and only if the resist is highly transparent for the laser light's output wavelength λ and, simultaneously, absorbing at λ/2. As a result, a given sample relative to the focused laser beam can be scanned while changing the resist's solubility only in a confined volume. The geometry of the latter mainly depends on the iso-intensity surfaces of the focus. Concretely, those regions of the laser beam which exceed a given exposure threshold of the photosensitive medium define the basic building block, the so-called ''[[voxel]]''. Other parameters which influence the actual shape of the voxel are the laser mode and the refractive-index mismatch between the resist and the immersion system leading to spherical aberration.

It was found that [[polarization effects]] in laser 3D nanolithography can be employed to fine-tune the feature sizes (and corresponding aspect ratio) in the structuring of photoresists. This proves polarization to be a variable parameter next to laser power (intensity), scanning speed (exposure duration), accumulated dose, etc.

In [[statistics]], the '''observed information''', or '''observed Fisher information''', is the negative of the second derivative (the [[Hessian matrix]]) of the "log-likelihood" (the logarithm of the [[likelihood function]]). It is a sample-based version of the [[Fisher information]].

==Definition==
Suppose we observe [[random variable]]s &lt;math&gt;X_1,\ldots,X_n&lt;/math&gt;, independent and identically distributed with density ''f''(''X'';&amp;nbsp;θ), where θ is a (possibly unknown) vector.  Then the log-likelihood of the parameters &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; given the data &lt;math&gt;X_1,\ldots,X_n&lt;/math&gt; is

:&lt;math&gt;\ell(\theta | X_1,\ldots,X_n) = \sum_{i=1}^n \log f(X_i| \theta) &lt;/math&gt;.

We define the '''observed information matrix''' at &lt;math&gt;\theta^{*}&lt;/math&gt; as

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{J}(\theta^*) 
  = - \left. 
    \nabla \nabla^{\top} 
    \ell(\theta)
  \right|_{\theta=\theta^*} 
&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;= -

&lt;/math&gt;

In many instances, the observed information is evaluated at the [[Maximum likelihood|maximum-likelihood estimate]].&lt;ref&gt;Dodge, Y. (2003) ''The Oxford Dictionary of Statistical Terms'', OUP. {{isbn|0-19-920613-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fisher information==
The [[Fisher information]] &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I}(\theta)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[expected value]] of the observed information given a single observation &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; distributed according to the hypothetical model with parameter &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I}(\theta) = \mathrm{E}(\mathcal{J}(\theta))&lt;/math&gt;.

==Applications==

'''Pearl growing''' is a [[metaphor]] taken from the process of small bits of sand growing to make a beautiful pearl, which is used in [[information literacy]]. Pearl Growing is in this context the process of using one information item (like a [[subject term]] or [[citation]]) to find more information. This search strategy is most successfully employed at the beginning of the research process as the searcher uncovers new [[pearl]]s about his or her topic.

==Citation pearl growing==
Citation pearl growing is the act of using one relevant source, or [[citation]], to find more relevant sources on a topic. The searcher usually has a document that matches a topic or information need. From this document, the searcher is able to find other keywords, descriptors and themes to use in a subsequent search.&lt;ref&gt;Markey, K. &amp;  Cochrane, P. 1981. ONTAP: Online Training and Practice Manual for ERIC Database Searchers, 2nd edn, Syracuse University, N.Y. October 1981. ERIC Clearinghouse on Information Resources.&lt;/ref&gt; Citation Pearl Growing is a popular search and retrieval method used by [[librarian]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ramer | first1 = S | year = 2005 | title = Site-ation pearl growing: Methods and librarianship history and theory | journal = Journal of the Medical Library Association | volume = 93 | issue = 3| pages = 397–400 | pmc=1175807 | pmid=16059431}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subject pearl growing==
Subject pearl growing is a strategy used in an [[Bibliographic database|electronic database]] that has [[Subject term|subject]] or [[Keyword (computer programming)|keyword]] descriptors. By clicking on one [[Subject term|subject]], the searcher is able to find other related [[Subject term|subjects]] and subdivisions that may or may not be useful to the search.

==Internet pearl growing==
Searchers use the pearl growing technique when surfing the [[Internet]]. Using the theory that websites that link to each other are similar, a searcher can move from site to site, collecting information. Ramer (2005) suggests pearl growing by using the [[pearl]] as a search term in [[Web search engine|search engines]] or even in the [[URL]].

'''''Periodic Tales: A Cultural History of the Elements, from Arsenic to Zinc''''' is a 2011 popular science and history book by English writer [[Hugh Aldersey-Williams]], on the history and cultural associations of the [[chemical element]]s. The book is divided into five sections, "Power", "Fire", "Craft", "Beauty", and "Earth", which group different elements according to their primary cultural connotations, rather than their position on the [[periodic table]].&lt;ref name="Buntrock"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Buntrock|first1=Robert E.|title=Review of Periodic Tales: A Cultural History of the Elements, from Arsenic to Zinc|journal=[[Journal of Chemical Education|J.

A '''pivot table''' is a [[Table (information)|table]] of statistics that summarize the data of a more extensive table (such as from a [[database]], [[spreadsheet]], or [[business intelligence software|business intelligence program]]). This summary might include sums, averages, or other statistics, which the pivot table groups together in a meaningful way.

Pivot tables are a technique in [[data processing]]. They enable a person to arrange and rearrange (or "pivot") statistics in order to draw attention to useful information.

Although ''pivot table'' is a generic term, [[Microsoft Corporation]] [[trademarked]] ''PivotTable'' in the United States in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; Bill Jelen and Mike Alexander refer to [[Pito Salas]] as the "father of pivot tables". While working on a concept for a new program that would eventually become [[Lotus Improv]], Salas noted that spreadsheets have patterns of data. A tool that could help the user recognize these patterns would help to build advanced data models quickly. With Improv, users could define and store sets of categories, then change views by dragging category names with the mouse. This core functionality would provide the model for pivot tables.

[[Lotus Software|Lotus Development]] released Improv in 1991 on the [[NeXT]] platform. A few months after the release of Improv, [[Brio Technology]] published a standalone [[Macintosh]] implementation, called DataPivot (with technology eventually patented in 1999).&lt;ref&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt; [[Borland]] purchased the DataPivot technology in 1992 and implemented it in their own spreadsheet application, [[Quattro Pro]].

In 1993 the Microsoft Windows version of Improv appeared. Early in 1994 [[Microsoft Excel]]&amp;nbsp;5&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; brought a new functionality called a "PivotTable" to market. Microsoft further improved this feature in later versions of Excel:

* Excel 97 included a new and improved PivotTable Wizard, the ability to create calculated fields, and new pivot cache objects that allow developers to write [[Visual Basic for Applications]] macros to create and modify pivot tables
* Excel 2000 introduced "Pivot Charts" to represent pivot-table data graphically

In 2007 Oracle Corporation made &lt;code&gt;PIVOT&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;UNPIVOT&lt;/code&gt; operators available in [[Oracle Database]] 11g.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mechanics==
For typical data entry and storage, data usually appear in ''flat'' tables, meaning that they consist of only columns and rows, as in the following portion of a sample spreadsheet showing data on shirt types:

[[File:pivottable-Flatdata.png]]

While tables such as these can contain many data items, it can be difficult to get summarized information from them.  A pivot table can help quickly summarize the data and highlight the desired information.  The usage of a pivot table is extremely broad and depends on the situation.  The first question to ask is, "What am I seeking?" In the example here, let us ask, "How many ''Units'' did we sell in each ''Region'' for every ''Ship Date?''":

[[File:pivottable-Pivoted.PNG]]

A pivot table usually consists of ''row'', ''column'' and ''data'' (or ''fact'') fields.  In this case, the column is ''Ship Date'', the row is ''Region'' and the data we would like to see is (sum of) ''Units''.  These fields allow several kinds of [[aggregate function|aggregations]], including: sum, average, [[standard deviation]], count, etc.  In this case, the total number of units shipped is displayed here using a ''sum'' aggregation.

==Implementation==
Using the example above, software will find all distinct values for ''Region''. In this case, they are: ''North'', ''South'', ''East'', ''West''. Furthermore, it will find all distinct values for ''Ship Date''. Based on the aggregation type, ''sum'', it will summarize the fact, the quantities of ''Unit'', and display them in a multidimensional chart.  In the example above, the first datum is 66.  This number was obtained by finding all records where both ''Region'' was ''East'' and ''Ship Date'' was ''1/31/2005'', and adding the ''Units'' of that collection of records (''i.e.'', cells E2 to E7) together to get a final result.

Pivot tables are not created automatically. For example, in Microsoft Excel one must first select the entire data in the original table and then go to the Insert tab and select "Pivot Table" (or "Pivot Chart"). The user then has the option of either inserting the pivot table into an existing sheet or creating a new sheet to house the pivot table.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://desktopschool.com/make-an-excel-pivot-table-in-2-steps/|website=The Desktop School|title=Make an Excel Pivot Table in 2 Steps|accessdate=27 July 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150627141907/http://desktopschool.com/make-an-excel-pivot-table-in-2-steps/#|archive-date=2015-06-27|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A pivot table field list is provided to the user which lists all the column headers present in the data. For instance, if a table represents sales data of a company, it might include Date of sale, Sales person, Item sold, Color of item, Units sold, Per unit price, and Total price. This makes the data more readily accessible.

{| class="wikitable sortable"
|-
! Date of sale !! Sales person !! Item sold !! Color of item !! Units sold !! Per unit price !! Total price
|-
| 10/01/13 || Jones || Notebook || Black || 8 || 25000 || 200000
|-
| 10/02/13 || Prince || Laptop || Red || 4 || 35000 || 140000
|-
| 10/03/13 || George || Mouse || Red || 6 || 850 || 5100
|-
| 10/04/13 || Larry || Notebook || White || 10 || 27000 || 270000
|-
| 10/05/13 || Jones || Mouse || Black || 4 || 700 || 3200
|}

The fields that would be created will be visible on the right hand side of the worksheet. By default, the pivot table layout design will appear below this list.

Each of the fields from the list can be dragged on to this layout, which has four options :
# Report filter
# Column labels
# Row labels
# Summation values

===Report filter===
Report filter is used to apply a filter to an entire table. For example, if the "Color of Item" field is dragged to this area, then the table constructed will have a report filter inserted above the table. This report filter will have drop-down options (Black, Red, and White in the example above). When an option is chosen from this [[drop-down list]] ("Black" in this example), then the table that would be visible will contain only the data from those rows that have the "Color of Item = Black".

===Column labels===
Column labels are used to apply a filter to one or more columns that have to be shown in the pivot table. For instance if the "Sales person" field is dragged to this area, then the table constructed will have values from the column "Sales Person", ''i.e.'', one will have number of columns equal to the number of "Sales person". There will also be one added column of Total. In the example above, this instruction will create five columns in the table&amp;nbsp;— one for each sales person, and Grand Total. There will be a filter above the data&amp;nbsp;— column labels&amp;nbsp;— from which one can select or deselect a particular sales person for the pivot table.

This table will not have any numerical values as no numerical field is selected but when it is selected, the values will automatically get updated in the column of "Grand total".

===Row labels===
Row labels are used to apply a filter to one or more rows that have to be shown in the pivot table. For instance if the "Sales person" field is dragged on this area then the other output table constructed will have values from the column "Sales person", ''i.e.'', one will have number of rows equal to the number of "Sales Person". There will also be one added row of "Grand Total". In the example above, this instruction will create five rows in the table&amp;nbsp;— one for each sales person, and Grand Total. There will be a filter above the data&amp;nbsp;— row labels&amp;nbsp;— from which one can select or deselect a particular sales person for the Pivot table.

This table will not have any numerical values, as no numerical field is selected, but when it is selected, the values will automatically get updated in the Row of "Grand Total".

===Summation values===
This usually takes a field that has numerical values that can be used for different types of calculations. However, using text values would also not be wrong; instead of Sum it will give a count. So, in the example above, if the "Units sold" field is dragged to this area along with row label of "Sales person", then the instruction will add a new column, "Sum of units sold", which will have values against each sales person.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Row labels !! Sum of units sold
|-
| Jones|| 12
|-
| Prince ||4
|-
|George
|6
|-
|Larry
|10
|-
| Grand total || 32

== Application support ==
Pivot tables or pivot functionality are an integral part of many [[List of spreadsheet software|spreadsheet applications]] and some [[database software]], as well as being found in other data visualization tools and [[business intelligence]] packages.

; Spreadsheets
* [[Microsoft Excel]] supports PivotTables, which can be visualized through PivotCharts.&lt;ref name="Dalgleish2007"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Dalgleish |first1=Debra |title=Beginning PivotTables in Excel 2007: From Novice to Professional |date=2007 |publisher=Apress |isbn=9781430204336 |pages=233-257 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lleBg-leOhwC&amp;pg=PA233&amp;dq=%22Pivot+chart%22+-wikipedia&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj1jZWA08XdAhUsCDQIHeMBC0cQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Pivot%20chart%22%20-wikipedia&amp;f=false |accessdate=18 September 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[LibreOffice Calc]] supports pivot tables. Prior to version 3.4, this feature was named "DataPilot".
* [[Google Sheets]] initially allowed the creation of basic pivot tables via the pivot table [[Google Gadgets|gadget]] from [[Panorama Software|Panorama]] called Panorama Analytics, but {{as of | 2011 | lc = on }} this gadget provided limited functionality and was extremely slow with large data sets. In May 2011, Google announced the roll-out of a natively hosted pivot table feature in the Google spreadsheets editor.&lt;ref&gt;[https://drive.googleblog.com/2011/05/summarize-your-data-with-pivot-tables.html Docs Blog: Summarize your data with pivot tables&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

;Database support
* [[PostgreSQL]], an [[Object-relational database|object-relational database management system]], allows the creation of pivot tables using the ''tablefunc'' module.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.2/static/tablefunc.html|title=PostgreSQL: Documentation: 9.2: tablefunc|work=postgresql.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* [[MariaDB]], a MySQL fork, allows pivot tables using the CONNECT storage engine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb/connect-table-types-pivot-table-type/|title=CONNECT Table Types - PIVOT Table Type|work=mariadb.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Microsoft Access]] supports pivot queries under the name "crosstab" query.
* [[Oracle database]] supports the PIVOT operation.
* Some popular databases that do not directly support pivot functionality, such as [[Microsoft SQL server]]{{check|date=October 2017}} and [[SQLite]] can usually simulate pivot functionality using embedded functions, dynamic SQL or subqueries. The issue with pivoting in such cases is usually that the number of output columns must be known at the time the query starts to execute; for pivoting this is not possible as the number of columns is based on the data itself. Therefore, the names must be [[hard coded]] or the query to be executed must itself be created dynamically (meaning, prior to each use) based upon the data.

;Web applications
* [[ZK (framework)|ZK]], an Ajax framework, also allows the embedding of pivot tables in Web applications.

;Programming languages and libraries
* Programming languages and libraries suited to work with tabular data contain functions that allow the creation and manipulation of pivot tables. Python data analysis toolkit [[pandas (software)|pandas]] has the function ''pivot_table'', and the ''xs'' method useful to obtain sections of pivot tables.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.pivot_table.html|title=Pandas pivot_table}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Online analytical processing==
Excel pivot tables include the feature to directly query an [[online analytical processing]] (OLAP) server for retrieving data instead of getting the data from an Excel spreadsheet. On this configuration a pivot table is a simple client of an OLAP server. Excel's PivotTable not only allows for connecting to Microsoft's Analysis Service, but to any [[XML for Analysis]] (XMLA) OLAP standard-compliant server.

}}'''''Scientologie, Wissenschaft von der Beschaffenheit und der Tauglichkeit des Wissens''''' (''Scientology: Science of the Constitution and Usefulness of Knowledge'') is a 1934 book published by Dr. [[Anastasius Nordenholz]], in which he defines the term "Scientologie" or "Eidologie" as a science of knowing or knowledge and discusses the [[philosophy|philosophical]] implications of the concept.

The book has been cited by some as a possible source of inspiration for [[L. Ron Hubbard]] and his better-known conception of [[Scientology]], though this interpretation is disputed.

==Summary of the book==

[[Anastasius Nordenholz|Nordenholz]] highlights the problem of isolating knowledge as "a particular appearance of the world." He asks:

:"What is Knowing? What IS Knowledge? What can we know, what must we know about Knowledge/Knowing, to do justice to and to justify the world? The question is thus nothing less than self-knowing, determination of the nature of self, and also of self-realization and self-understanding of Knowledge/Knowing. Is this possible? If possible, how can the systemization of Knowledge/Knowing itself be accomplished? How can a Science of Knowledge/Knowing be produced?"

After establishing a number of definitions, he concludes that

:"the world is nothing but knowledge, merely an extraction from knowing....Only out of the equally valued mutual operation of Knowledge/Knowing as shaper &amp; creator, and world as created &amp; shaped, is it possible to arrive at the true science of the world....Out of this circumstance comes the right of Scientologie to treat the world as belonging to its counterpart, as an appendage of the consciousness."

He goes on to assert that human consciousness can be raised to a position of independence, or isolation, but notes that "The consciousness, which always remains a part and particular creation of the world, is incompetent to create from a nothingness because of this very worldliness. In order for the consciousness to be able to create, it has to first find a fountainhead source out of which it can create, and this Something is a Beingness."

Nordenholz next introduces the concept of a number of axioms and systems which "stand of their
own power and dignity, ''as if'' they were capable of, but do not need, a verification or confirmation from another source." He defines the structure of Scientologie:

:1. In axioms: exposition of the axioms and the axiom systems of consciousness.
:2. In systems: erection of the forming or moulding system of the consciousnesses, the comprehension system of the reason, all form the axiom system.
:3. In demonstration: justification of the produced comprehension systems and with that, working back to the underlying basis of the axiom systems.
:4. In study of the origin, nature, methods, and limits of knowledge: establishment of the Total-system of sciences from the foundation of Scientologie systems of knowledge and comprehension.

Nordenholz held that the most important axiom was the Axiom of Mediation:

:"The consciousness, nominated as the creator of the world, presupposes a wellspring, a source, out of which it can scoop; a Being, which somehow and in some measure can be reached thru consciousness, but which exists there by itself BEFORE and independent from the consciousness. The assumption of a creator activity of the consciousness is dependent upon the Standing Orders of self-primordial, free, detached, absolute Beings, the By-Itself-Being(s)."

==Relationship with Scientology==
{{see also|Free Zone (Scientology)}}
George Malko claims that [[Anastasius Nordenholz|Nordenholz]]'s concept of Scientologie has no proven connection to [[Scientology]], which was created later by [[L. Ron Hubbard]], although he notes some possible similarities between the ideas expounded by [[Anastasius Nordenholz|Nordenholz]] and Hubbard.&lt;ref&gt;Malko, George. ''Scientology: The Now Religion''. Dell, New York, 1970.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roy Wallis]] casts doubt on the perceived similarities, noting that Malko had used an English translation produced in 1968 by a former Scientologist, Woodward R. McPheeters. Wallis comments: 
:"McPheeters was a Scientologist of many years standing who left the movement for a schismatic offshoot, and in an atmosphere of mutual hostility. It is at least a possibility that this may have influenced the translation. An independent translation which I commissioned, of some pages from the original, seems to bear this out. The possible parallels with Hubbardian formulations are very much less evident."

He also notes that there is no evidence that Hubbard could read German.&lt;ref&gt;Wallis, Roy. ''[[The Road to Total Freedom]]'', p. 111. Heineman, London, 1976.&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, the [[Free Zone (Scientology)|Free Zone]] association of independent scientologists [http://www.freezone.org/ (Freie Zone e.V.)] considers the parallels in content sufficiently valid to republish it "in its original context".&lt;ref name = freezonescientologie&gt;[http://www.scientologie.org/english.htm ''Scientology - Science of the Constitution and Usefulness of Knowledge'']. Presentation of the book and of the dispute on domaine name, by Scientologie.org, [[Free Zone (Scientology)|Free Zone]] site.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "Scientologie" is a registered trademark of the [[Religious Technology Center]], which controls the [[Church of Scientology]]'s trademarks. It is used in French-speaking countries as a localized version of the word "Scientology",[http://www.scientologie.fr/] though in Germany the church uses "Scientology" instead.[http://www.scientology.de/home.html?locale=de]

The Church is currently in dispute with [[Free Zone (Scientology)|Free Zone]] Scientologists who have [[Schism (religion)|schism]]ed off into their own offshoot of Scientology. They use the [[domain name]] ''scientologie.de'' for their website; the Church has attempted to force the Free Zoners to relinquish this domain name, claiming trademark infringement. But the German courts have rejected this in the light of [[Anastasius Nordenholz|Nordenholz]] having coined the term long before the church registered it as a trademark; also refusing the argument of "possible confusion" because Free Zone ''per se'' does not sell courses nor indeed anything else; and that the use of a similar name in these circumstances was covered by the "fair use" policy.&lt;ref name=wipodecision&gt;[http://www.scientologie.org/gif/wipo-decision.pdf WIPO (German court) decision. In "scientologie.org - domain dispute".] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050819232335/http://www.scientologie.org/gif/wipo-decision.pdf |date=2005-08-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The English-language term "Scientology" originated neither with Hubbard nor [[Anastasius Nordenholz|Nordenholz]], but with [[philology|philologist]] [[Allen Upward]], who coined the term in 1907 in his book ''The New Word''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/newword00unkngoog ''The New Word: An Open Letter Addressed to the Swedish Academy in Stockholm on the Meaning of the Word Idealist'', Allen Upward, Mitchell Kennerley, 1914]&lt;/ref&gt;  
This reference is cited to be a use of the word to ridicule pseudoscientific theories in the book ''[[A Piece of Blue Sky]]'' by [[Jon Atack]].&lt;ref&gt;Atack, Jon. ''A Piece of Blue Sky'', p. 127. Lyle Stuart, 1990. {{ISBN|0-8184-0499-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"...unhappily scientology is as often mistaken for science as theology is for worship." &lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/newword00unkngoog#page/n152/mode/2up ''The New Word'', p.&amp;nbsp;149]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sense and respond''' has been used in [[control theory]] for several decades, primarily in [[closed system]]s such as refineries where comparisons are made between measurements and desired values, and system settings are adjusted to narrow the gap between the two. Since  the early 1980s, sense and respond has also been used to describe the behavior of certain open systems. 

Sense and respond is based on [[Lean manufacturing|lean principles]] and follows URSLIMM:
*U - understand customer value
*R - remove waste
*S - standardize
*L - learn by doing
*I - involve everyone
*M - measure what matters
*M - manage performance visually

The term "sense and respond" as a business concept was used in a 1992 [[American Management Association]] ''Management Review'' article by [[Stephan H. Haeckel]].  It was Developed by Haeckel at [[IBM]]’s Advanced Business Institute.

The '''Third-person effect''' &lt;ref name=Davison1983&gt;{{cite journal|last=Davison|first=W.|title=The third-person effect in communication|journal=Public Opinion Quarterly|year=1983|volume=47|issue=1|pages=1–15|doi=10.1086/268763}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[hypothesis]]  predicts that people tend to perceive that [[Mass communication|mass media]] messages have a greater effect on others than on themselves, based on personal [[bias]]es. The Third-person effect manifests itself through an individual’s overestimation of the effect of a mass communicated message on the generalized other, or an underestimation of the effect of a mass communicated message on themselves.

These types of perceptions stem from a self-motivated social desirability (not feeling influenced by mass messages promotes [[self-esteem]]), a social-distance [[corollary]] (choosing to dissociate oneself from the others who may be influenced) and a perceived exposure to a message (others choose to be influenced by [[persuasive]] communication).&lt;ref name="Davison1983"/&gt; Other names for the effect are "Third-person perception" and "Web Third-person effect". From 2015 the effect named "Web Third-person effect" when it is verified in social media, media websites, blogs and in websites in general.&lt;ref name="Antonopoulos 48–58"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Antonopoulos|first=Nikos|title=Web Third-person effect in structural aspects of the information on media websites|journal=Computers in Human Behavior|date=March 2015|volume=44|issue=3|pages=48–58|doi=10.1016/j.chb.2014.11.022|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Foundations and Articulation of the Hypothesis==

Sociologist W. Phillips Davison, who first articulated the third-person effect hypothesis in 1983, explains that the phenomenon first piqued his interest in 1949 or 1950 upon learning of a Japanese attempt during [[World War II]] to dissuade black U.S. soldiers from fighting at [[Battle of Iwo Jima|Iwo Jima]] using propaganda.  As Davison recounts, the leaflets stressed that the Japanese did not have a quarrel with the black soldiers and that they should give up or desert.  Although there was no indication that the leaflets had any effect on the soldiers, the incident preceded a substantial reshuffle among the officers and the unit was withdrawn the next day.&lt;ref name=Davison1983 /&gt;

Several years later while interviewing [[West Germany|West German]] journalists to determine the influence of the press on foreign policy, Davison asked the journalists to estimate the influence their editorials had on readers.  Although no evidence could be found to support their claims, Davison writes that a common response was, “The editorials have little effect on people like you and me, but the ordinary reader is likely to be influenced quite a lot.”&lt;ref name=Davison1983 /&gt;

In both anecdotes, the parties that evaluated the impact of the communication estimated a larger media effect for others than on self.  These and other experiences led Davison to articulate what he called the third-person effect hypothesis, which predicts:

:“people will tend to overestimate the influence that mass communications have on the attitudes and behavior of others.  More specifically, individuals who are members of an audience that is exposed to a persuasive communication (whether or not this communication is intended to be persuasive) will expect the communication to have a greater effect on others than on themselves.  And whether or not these individuals are among the ostensible audience for the message, the impact that they expect this communication to have on others may lead them to take some action.  Any effect that the communication achieves may thus be due not to the reaction of the ostensible audience but rather to the behavior of those who anticipate, or think they perceive, some reaction on the part of others.” (p. 3).&lt;ref name=Davison1983 /&gt;

In a case study conducted by Douglas McLeod et al. (1997),&lt;ref name=McLeodEvelandNathanson1997/&gt; the third-person effect was analyzed via participants’ perceptions of being influenced by violent or misogynistic lyrics from [[Hip hop music|rap music]]. The sample participants were divided up into three groups: one listened to violent rap music, another heard misogynistic rap music and the third group was the control. All lyrics heard were from actual, recorded songs. The study asked subjects to estimate the effects of listening to these types of lyrics on someone’s behaviors, knowledge and attitudes. They were also asked how these lyrics would affect themselves, students at their university, youth in New York or Los Angeles, and the average person. The study found that students found the rap lyrics to be least influential on themselves and more influential on youths in New York or Los Angeles. Simply put, people are more likely to assume everyone else is more easily influenced by messages than themselves. Furthermore, a recent study conducted by Nikos Antonopoulos et al. (2015),&lt;ref name="Antonopoulos 48–58"/&gt; found characteristics of what users observe when visiting a media [[website]] as well as a prediction model. The influence that this information has over their opinion verifies the existence of Web Third-person effect (WTPE). With the use of an online survey (N = 9150) in all media websites ([[radio station]], [[television station]], portal, [[newspaper]] and email-[[social media]]) it was proved that the variables that have a greater impact either on others or our friends than ourselves are: The number of users being concurrently online on the same media website, the exact number of users having read each article on a media website as well as the number of users having shared a news article on [[Facebook]], [[Twitter]], or other social networks. Moreover, age is a significant factor that explains the findings and is important to the effect. Additionally, factors that affect the influence of the user generated messages on others than on oneself were found. Furthermore, the more credible the news is perceived to be and when there is not a particular mediated message the WTPE is absent confirming the existing theory.

==Initial Support for the Third-Person Effect Hypothesis==

To support the third-person effect hypothesis, Davison (1983) conducted four minor and informal surveys.  Each survey asked between 25 and 35 participants to estimate the influence of persuasive communication on themselves and others.  Participants estimated self-other effects for (1) a campaign theme on gubernatorial vote choice, (2) television advertising on children, (3) the results of early presidential primaries on vote choice, and (4) campaign messages on presidential vote choice. On average they estimated (1) other New York voters were more influenced by campaign themes than they were personally, (2) other children were more influenced by television advertising than they had been personally, (3) others were more influenced by the results of early presidential primaries than they were personally, and (4) others were more influenced by campaign advertisements than they were personally. Although the surveys were informal, they support the hypothesis.&lt;ref name=Davison1983 /&gt;

===Is Third-Person Perception a Methodological Artifact?===

Price and Tewksbury tested whether the third-person effect was a methodological artifact as a result of asking participants self-other questions in close proximity.  Using a three-condition experiment in which they asked participants in the first condition self-only questions, participants in the second condition other-only questions, and participants in the third condition self and other questions, Price and Tewksbury’s results indicate consistent estimates of self and other estimates across conditions.  These results, then, indicate the effect is not the result of a methodological artifact.&lt;ref name=PriceTewksbury1996&gt;{{cite journal|last=Price|first=V.|author2=Tewksbury, D. |title=Measuring the third-person effect of news: The impact of question order, contrast and knowledge|journal=International Journal of Public Opinion Research|year=1996|volume=8|issue=2|pages=120–141|doi=10.1093/ijpor/8.2.120}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Major Factors Facilitate the Third-Person Effect==

According to Perloff (1999, 2009),&lt;ref name=Perloff1999 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Perloff2009&gt;{{cite book|last1=Perloff|first1=R.M.|editor1-last=Bryant|editor1-first=Jennings|editor2-last=Oliver|editor2-first=Mary Beth|title=Media Effects: Advances in Theory and Research|date=2009|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781135591106|pages=252–268|edition=3rd|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2BeOAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA252|language=en|chapter=Mass media, social perception, and the third-person effect}}&lt;/ref&gt; two major factors facilitate the third-person effect: judgments of message desirability and perceived social distance (social distance corollary). In their meta-analysis of studies of third-person perception Sun, Pan, and Shen (2008) found that message desirability is the most important moderator of third-person perception.&lt;ref name=SunPanShen2008&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sun|first=Y.|author2=Pan, Z. |author3=Shen, L. |title=Understanding the third-person perception: Evidence from a meta-analysis|journal=Journal of Communication|year=2008|volume=58 | issue = 2|pages=280–300|doi=10.1111/j.1460-2466.2008.00385.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Third-person effects are particularly pronounced when the message is perceived as undesirable—that is, when people infer that “this message may not be so good for me” or “it’s not cool to admit you’re influenced by this media program.” In line with these predictions, people have been found to perceive content that is typically thought to be antisocial to have a larger impact on others than on themselves (e.g., [[Research on the effects of violence in mass media|television violence]], pornography, antisocial rap music).&lt;ref name=Perloff2009 /&gt; Indeed, many researchers have found evidence that undesirable messages, such as violent and hateful messages, yield a greater third-person effect.&lt;ref name=AndsagerWhite2007&gt;{{cite book|last=Andsager|first=J.L.|last2=White|first2=H.A. |title=Self Versus Others: Media, Messages, and the Third-person Effect|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates|year=2007|ISBN=9780805857160 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dWkWQzQppZIC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DuckMullin1995&gt;{{cite journal|last=Duck|first=J.M.|author2=Mullin, B.-A. |title=The perceived impact of the mass media: Reconsidering the third person effect|journal=European Journal of Social Psychology|year=1995|volume=25 | issue = 1|pages=77–93|doi=10.1002/ejsp.2420250107}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GuntherHwa1996 /&gt;&lt;ref name=HoorensRuiter1996&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hoornes|first=V.|author2=Ruiter, S. |title=The optimal impact phenomenon: Beyond the third person effect|journal=European Journal of Social Psychology|year=1996|volume=26|issue=4|pages=599–610|doi=10.1002/(sici)1099-0992(199607)26:4&lt;599::aid-ejsp773&gt;3.0.co;2-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, when messages are perceived as desirable, people are not so likely to exhibit a third-person effect. According to Perloff (2009),&lt;ref name=Perloff2009 /&gt; the first-person effect, or reversed third-person effect, is more common for desirable messages&lt;ref name=CohenDavis1991 /&gt; and seems to emerge when agreement with the message reflects positively on the self and to some degree when the message touches on topics that are congruent with the orientation of groups with which individuals identify. According to the self-enhancement view, if the third-person effect is driven by a desire to preserve self-esteem, people should be willing to acknowledge effects for communications that are regarded as socially desirable, healthy, or otherwise good for the self.&lt;ref name=HoorensRuiter1996 /&gt; Undergraduates perceived that others will be more influenced than themselves by cigarette ads but they will be more affected by anti-tobacco and drunk-driving PSAs.&lt;ref name=Meirick2005&gt;{{cite journal|last=Meirick|first=P.C.|title=Rethinking the target corollary: The effects of social distance, perceived exposure, and perceived predispositions on first-person and third-person perceptions|journal=Communication Research|year=2005|volume=32|issue=6|pages=822–843|doi=10.1177/0093650205281059}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Another factor that influences the magnitude of the third-person effect is perceived social distance between self and comparison others. In the “[[social distance corollary]],” the disparity of self and other is increased as perceived distance between self and comparison others is increased.&lt;ref name=Meirick2005 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Meirick2004&gt;{{cite journal|last=Meirick|first=P.C.|title=Topic-relevant reference groups and dimensions of distance: Political advertising and first-and third-person effects|journal=Communication Research|year=2004|volume=31|issue=2|pages=234–255|doi=10.1177/0093650203261514}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although social distance is not a necessary condition for the third-person effect to occur, increasing the social distance makes the third-person effect larger. In their meta-analysis, Andsager and White (2007) concluded that “Research consistently finds that others who are anchored to self as a point of reference are perceived to be less influenced by persuasive messages than are others who are not defined and, therefore, not anchored to any point of reference at all” (p.&amp;nbsp;92).&lt;ref name=AndsagerWhite2007 /&gt;

==Psychological Underpinnings of the Third-Person Effect Hypothesis==

Perloff notes that the majority of third-person effect studies attribute the psychological underpinnings of the effect to either attribution theory or biased optimism.&lt;ref name=Perloff1999&gt;{{cite journal|last=Perloff|first=R.M.|title=The third-person effect: A critical review and synthesis|journal=Media Psychology|year=1999|volume=1|issue=4|pages=353–378|doi=10.1207/s1532785xmep0104_4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Attribution theory]] predicts that actors tend to attribute their actions to situational factors while observers tend to attribute the same actions to dispositional factors.  For example, attribution theory predicts that a student who turns in a late assignment may explain to the professor that the tardiness is uncharacteristic and due to a situational factor like an unusual computer problem while the professor might believe the tardiness was due instead to a dispositional factor like the student’s laziness.  In the context of the third-person effect hypothesis, then, attribution theory explains why a person may think that he or she understands the underlying persuasive aspects of the message while others’ dispositional flaws prevent them from perceiving those same aspects.&lt;ref name=Perloff1999 /&gt;

Biased optimism predicts that people tend to judge themselves as less likely than others to experience negative consequences and, conversely, that people tend to judge themselves as more likely than others to experience positive events.  In the context of the third-person effect hypothesis, biased optimism explains why people judge themselves as being less likely than others to be affected by persuasion.&lt;ref name=Perloff1999 /&gt;

==Meta-Analytic Support for the Perceptual Component==

In a critical review and synthesis of the third-person effect hypothesis, Perloff (1999) noted that of the 45 published articles that had tested the phenomenon by 1999, all had found support for the perceptual component of the hypothesis.&lt;ref name=Perloff1999 /&gt;

One year later, Paul, Salwen, and Dupagne conducted a meta-analysis of 32 empirical analyses that tested the perceptual component of the third-person effect hypothesis.  Their results indicate the perceptual component of the third-person effect hypothesis received robust support (''r'' = .50), especially compared to meta-analyses of other media effects theories.&lt;ref name=PaulSalwenDupagne2000 /&gt;

Paul, Salwen, and Dupagne (2000) also found three significant moderators of the perceptual component of the third-person effect hypothesis: (1) sampling – samples obtained from nonrandom samples yielded greater third-person effect differences than samples obtained from random samples; (2) respondent – samples obtained from student samples yielded greater third-person effect differences than samples obtained from non-student samples; and (3) message – different types of content (e.g., general media messages, pornography, television violence, commercial advertisements, political content, nonpolitical news, etc.) have differing effects on the size of the obtained third-person perceptions.&lt;ref name=PaulSalwenDupagne2000&gt;{{cite journal|last=Paul|first=B.|author2=Salwen, M.B. |author3=Dupagne, M. |title=The third-person effect: A meta-analysis of the perceptual hypothesis|journal=Mass Communication &amp; Society|year=2000|volume=3|issue=1|pages=57–85|doi=10.1207/s15327825mcs0301_04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Support for the Behavioral Component==

Multiple studies have found support for the behavioral component of the third-person effect hypothesis.  Possibly because Davison noted that censors seldom admit to have been adversely affected by the information they proscribe,&lt;ref name=Davison1983 /&gt;  scholars who have found support for the behavioral component have generally operationalized behavior as a willingness to censor content to stop the content from having the perceived negative persuasive impact on others.&lt;ref name=Perloff1999 /&gt;

Specifically, scholars have demonstrated that third-person perception predicts willingness to censor pornography,&lt;ref name=Gunther1995&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gunther|first=A.C.|title=Overrating the X-rating: The third-person perception and support for censorship of pornography|journal=Journal of Communication|year=1995|volume=45|issue=1|pages=27–38|doi=10.1111/j.1460-2466.1995.tb00712.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=RojasShahFaber1996&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rojas|first=H.|author2=Shah, D.V. |author3=Faber, R.J. |title=For the good of others: Censorship and the third-person effect|journal=International Journal of Public Opinion Research|year=1996|volume=8|issue=2|pages=163–186|doi=10.1093/ijpor/8.2.163}}&lt;/ref&gt;   television violence,&lt;ref name=RojasShahFaber1996 /&gt;  sexual and violent television in Singapore,&lt;ref name=GuntherHwa1996&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gunther|first=A.C.|author2=Hwa, A.P. |title=Public perceptions of television influence and opinions about censorship in Singapore|journal=International Journal of Public Opinion Research|year=1996|volume=8|issue=3|pages=248–265|doi=10.1093/ijpor/8.3.248}}&lt;/ref&gt;  cigarette, beer, liquor, and gambling advertising,&lt;ref name=ShahFaberYoun1999&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shah|first=D.V.|author2=Faber, R.J. |author3=Youn, S. |title=Susceptibility and severity: Perceptual dimensions underlying the third-person effect|journal=Communication Research|year=1999|volume=26|issue=2|pages=240–267|doi=10.1177/009365099026002006}}&lt;/ref&gt; rap music&lt;ref name=McLeodEvelandNathanson1997&gt;{{cite journal|last=McLeod|first=D.M.|author2=Eveland, W.P. |author3=Nathanson, A.I. |title=Support for censorship of violent and misogynic rap lyrics: An analysis of the third-person effect|journal=Communication Research|year=1997|volume=24|issue=2|pages=153–174|doi=10.1177/009365097024002003}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the number of users being concurrently online on the same media website, the exact number of users having read each article on a media website as well as the number of users having shared a news article on Facebook, Twitter, or other social networks.&lt;ref name="Antonopoulos 48–58"/&gt;

Scholars, however, have not found that third-person perception predicts willingness to censor news or political media content including censorship of press coverage of the O.J. Simpson trial,&lt;ref name=SalwenDriscoll1997&gt;{{cite journal|last=Salwen|first=M.B.|author2=Driscoll, P.D. |title=Consequences of third-person perception in support of press restrictions in the O.J.

==Extending the Hypothesis==

Scholars have noted that in some situations, people don’t always estimate greater media effects for others than for themselves.  Indeed, in certain situations people tend to estimate greater media effects on themselves than on others, and in other situations people tend to estimate similar media effects on self and others.  These two phenomena are commonly known as first person and second person effects respectively.

===First Person Effects===

====First Person Perception====

First person effects – the estimation of greater media effects on self than others – tends to happen in situations in which people judge it desirable to be influenced by the media message.  Innes and Zeitz first documented this phenomenon in 1988 when they noticed that participants exposed to content with a violent message exhibited traditional third-person effects while those exposed to a public service announcement exhibited the reverse.  They described this reverse effect, however, only as “something akin to a third person effect” (p.&amp;nbsp;461).&lt;ref name=InnesZeitz1988&gt;{{cite journal|last=Innes|first=J.M.|author2=Zeitz, H. |title=The public's view of the impact of the mass media: A test of the "third-person" effect.|journal=European Journal of Social Psychology|year=1988|volume=18|issue=5|pages=457–463|doi=10.1002/ejsp.2420180507}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several years later, Cohen and Davis, who found that people tended to overestimate the effect of attack advertisements for disliked candidates on themselves than on others, coined the term “reverse third-person effect” (p.&amp;nbsp;687).&lt;ref name=CohenDavis1991&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cohen|first=J.|author2=Davis, R.G. |title=Third-person effects and the differential impact in negative political advertising|journal=Journalism Quarterly|year=1991|volume=68|issue=4|pages=680–688|doi=10.1177/107769909106800409}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The same year, Tiedge, Silverblatt, Havice, and Rosenfeld coined the term “first-person effect” to refer to the perceived effects of media on self as being more than on others.&lt;ref name=TiedgeEtAl1991&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tiedge|first=J.T.|author2=Silverbaltt, A. |author3=Havice, M.J. |author4=Rosenfeld, R. |title=Discrepancy between perceived first person and perceived third-person mass media effects|journal=Journalism Quarterly|year=1991|volume=68|issue=1/2|pages=141–154|doi=10.1177/107769909106800115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, Gunther &amp; Thorson, in a study that paved the way for extension of the third-person effect hypothesis, demonstrated empirically that the social desirability of the message tended to affect whether participants were likely to exhibit third- or first- person effects.  Socially desirable messages, Gunther and Thorson argue, tend to produce first-person effects while messages that are not perceived as desirable to be influenced by tend to produce traditional third-person effects.&lt;ref name=GuntherThorson1992&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gunther|first=A.C.|author2=Thorson, E. |title=Perceived persuasive effects of commercials and public service announcements: The third-person effect in new domains|journal=Communication Research|year=1992|volume=19|issue=5|pages=574–596|doi=10.1177/009365092019005002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====First Person Behavioral Effects====

Only a handful of studies have, intentionally or unintentionally, examined the behavioral component of the first-person effect.&lt;ref name=PriceTewksburyHuang1998/&gt;&lt;ref name=HuhDelormeReid2004&gt;{{cite journal|last=Huh|first=J.|author2=Delorme, D. |author3=Reid, L.N. |title=The third-person effect and its influence on behavioral outcomes in a product advertising context: The case of direct-to-consumer prescription drug advertising|journal=Communication Research|year=2004|volume=31|issue=5|pages=568–599|doi=10.1177/0093650204267934}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ParkSalmon2005&gt;{{cite journal|last=Park|first=H.S.|author2=Salmon, C.T. |title=A test of the third-person effect in public relations: Application of social comparison theory|journal=Journalism Quarterly|year=2005|volume=82|pages=25–43|doi=10.1177/107769900508200103}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GolanBanning2008&gt;{{cite journal|last=Golan|first=G.J.|author2=Banning, S. |title=Exploring a link between the third-person effect and the theory of reasoned action: Beneficial ads and social expectations.|journal=American Behavioral Scientist|year=2008|volume=52|issue=2|pages=208–224|doi=10.1177/0002764208321352}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Day2008&gt;{{cite journal|last=Day|first=A.|title=Out of the living room and into the voting booth: An analysis of corporate public affairs advertising under the third person effect|journal=American Behavioral Scientist|year=2008|volume=52|issue=2|pages=243–260|doi=10.1177/0002764208321354}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Of these, only one has specifically examined a relationship between first-person perceptions and behavioral consequences.  Day examined the relationship between first-person effects from socially desirable issue advertisements and the likelihood of voting for legislation supporting the issue.  Day found a significant relationship between first-person perceptions of the advertisement and the reported likelihood of voting for the legislation.

{{italic title}}
'''''Violence and Activism At The Border''''' is a book by University of Texas professor [[Kathleen Staudt]], in which the author discusses violence against women in the border city [[Ciudad Juarez]]. 
	
As Staudt states when discussing the roadmap of the book, “The book contains conceptual, empirical and strategic analyses of interest to multiple audiences concerned with violence, borders, [[activism]], and women and gender.”
	
She does this by composing a review on existing knowledge of violence to women in [[Ciudad Juárez|Cuidad Juarez]], showing data surveys from the survivors of violence in the city, looking at who exactly are the victims, how they reacted, their reasoning to how the violence happened and how much do they fear for their safety in their home. 
	
Chapter Four is more concerned to how activism from local and transnational feminist organizations spread awareness to the violent situation in the border city with its biggest protest in 2004 bringing in approximately 5,000 to 8,000 people to protest against femicide (the murders of women being unsolved and ignored by local law enforcement). This was the peak of the movement but it did bring necessary change as law enforcement in Ciudad Juarez did step up to the concerns of the community and the activists of human rights groups.

Chapter Five is where Staudt looks at the changes and provides an analysis if it is just weak attempts to try and calm activists and community members of their concerns. There has been better enforcement than before but the situation is still very much a depressing one for the safety of women in Ciudad Juarez.

One conclusion that Staudt makes in her book is how neoliberal economic policy has created an environment beside the United States where there are large maquiladoras that provide massive employment but with only 25-50 dollars a week being paid to these workers, putting many in the city into poverty. Violence is more likely in poverty since there is lack of control and added stress of being in poverty. This is why there’s greater numbers of violence below the poverty line. Add that with the law enforcement in Ciudad Juarez not being concerned about the well being of women in the city, having a culture of violence to women being the norm.

With activism having put more pressure towards the government, Staudt shows the changes the government has made could be much better but many Mexican politicians and bureaucrats have been timid in making too much changes in fear of angering the male population in, making the changes for women’s safety in Mexico to be slow but steady.

'''Visual research''' is a qualitative research methodology that relies on the use of artistic mediums to "produce and represent knowledge." These artistic mediums include, but are not limited to: [[film]], [[photography]], [[drawing]]s, [[painting]]s, and [[sculptures]]. The artistic mediums provide a rich source of information that has the ability of capturing reality. They also reveal information about what the medium captures, but the artist or the creator behind the medium. Using photography as an example, the photographs taken illustrate reality and give information about the photographer through the angle, focus of the image, and the moment in which the photograph was taken.

==  Research process, a definition and visual images ==

Images are an essential component for different sorts on inquires in a wide range of topics and research questions may call for a visual component in a variety of ways. One way could be to the research questions or the phenomena being examined, or the researcher could be the one making new images. After the visual material is created the resulting collection may be the base of further discussion, interviews, and or analysis, although the process of creating images is often a large part of the research process itself.

== Participant generated visual methodologies ==

This method of data collection is often used to elicit data or opinion, here the participant is the one who would be generating the visual data. If it is a photograph she or he has taken  it, or for a video, she or he has shot the visual data that will be further analysed. This is important as it allows the researcher to understand participants' views and perceptions.
 definition

=== Photovoice ===
Caroline C. Wang and Mary Anne Burris conceptualized the visual methodology called [[photovoice]].  Participants are provided with a camera and asked to produce an image-based account of their experiences and/or those things that are important to them in a particular context. These projects share the assumption that increased participant control of data generation through production of visual images will help to highlight important aspects of lived experience that might otherwise have been overlooked or ignored by researchers. This method is often used in social science and health research.

=== Fotohistorias ===
Ricardo Gomez and Sara Vannini (&lt;ref&gt;Gomez, Ricardo &amp; Vannini, Sara (2015). Fotohistorias: Participatory Photography and the Experience of Migration. CreateSpace, Bilingual: English &amp; Spanish&lt;/ref&gt;) introduced a variation of photovoice called Fotohistorias, that combines participant-generated photos and semistructured interviews to elicit lived experiences of immigrants and other marginalized communities. Fotohistorias combines the power of images and the richness of stories. Together, they yield more depth and sensitivity than either photos or interviews alone. Fotohistorias helps to quickly get to deep conversation about profound and meaningful topics, by focusing on the photos as a pretext for conversation. Fotohistorias helps elicit multiple perspectives and symbols from the same image or place, emphasizing how people’s perceptions and feelings shape meaning and experience. Fotohistorias participants frequently feel empowered, heard and valued, and gain a new perspective and agency over their current situation and context. &lt;ref&gt;www.fotohistorias.org&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Photo-elicitation ===
The photo-elicitation approach can include researcher or participant generated photographs. Photographs are introduced to the context of research interview based off the "assumption about the role and utility of photographs in promoting reflections that words alone cannot." Participant generated photo elicitation puts significance to the participants role in shaping the creation of visual images. It is important to note the value of the technique for "bridging culturally distinct worlds of the researcher and the researched." The term photo-elicitation originated from a paper published by Collier (1957), when it was initiated as a solution to the practical difficulties that research teams were having in relation to agreeing on categories for quality housing. Collier extended the method to examine how families adapted to residence among ethnically different people, and to new forms of work in urban factories, interviewing families and communities with photographs created by researchers. Reflecting on the use of photo-elicitation, Collier (1957, p.&amp;nbsp;858), argued that ‘pictures elicited longer and more comprehensive interviews but at the same time helped subjects overcome the fatigue and repetition of conventional interviews’ and noted the technique’s ‘compelling effect upon the informant, its ability to prod latent memory, to stimulate and release emotional statements about the informant’s life’. Photo-elicitation with researcher-initiated productions has been taken up by a range of researchers across the social sciences and related disciplines (Mannay 2016)&lt;ref&gt;Mannay, D. 2016 Visual, Narrative and Creative Research Methods Application, reflection and ethics. Abingdon: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Film-elicitation ===

This technique of data collection is mostly used by researchers who believe in Positivist or realist view of the world.
Making a film as opposed to simply shooting footages, involves editing and other post production tasks, such as adding subtitles, but it also rests upon a series of ideas concerning the place of visual representation within social science itself. 
This technique of data collection or data analysis is not widely used because of its multiple requirements. 
Making films – to elicit data or opinion, can be of 3 basic types:
1.Documenting or filming the subjects
2.Showing a film to the subjects and asking about their opinion 
3.Asking the subjects to make a film

There are 3 basic concerns when it comes to analysis of a film or a video: 
1. the analytical approach taken towards film or video.
2. method employed to derive data.
3. the kind of issue being analysed.

=== Benefits and limitations ===

This methodology is beneficial in its applicability to participants who may be [[illiterate]] or have difficulty communicating because of [[language barrier]]s, lack of education, or a disability. This characteristic of Photovoice allows researchers who choose to use this methodology to choose participants from a large sample pool because there are no language or literacy requirements. Photovoice may be a powerful research tool because it allows the researcher to see the topic being studied from the participant's perspective. It also encourages the participants and the researcher to reflect on the images and meaning behind them as they highlight an aspect or perspective of the research topic perhaps not previously considered. In this way visual methods of data production can act as tools of defamilairisation, fighting familiarity for both researchers and participants and allowing space for a more nuanced understanding of the topics studies (Mannay 2010)&lt;ref&gt;Mannay, D. 2010. Making the familiar strange: Can visual research methods render the familiar setting more perceptible?. Qualitative Research 10(1), pp. 91-111&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The use of Photovoice also has its limits. It requires the researcher to budget for the equipment used to carry it out, such as cameras, ink and printing costs. This may be problematic for the researcher if the research has been given limited or insufficient funds.
 
Another problem that may arise in the use of Photovoice is the question of photograph ownership. The researcher may be providing the equipment, but it is the participants who are taking the pictures. To avoid any potential issues regarding photograph ownership, it is advised that researchers obtain from their participants permission to use the photographs they take. It is particularly important to think carefully about informed consent in an era of digital dissemination and open access publication where images can be reworked, redistributed and recirculated in the digital economy, in ways that may not have been envisaged at the time of the research study (Mannay, 2014).&lt;ref&gt;Mannay, D. 2014. Story telling beyond the academy: exploring roles, responsibilities and regulations in the Open Access dissemination of research outputs and visual data. The Journal of Corporate Citizenship 54, pp. 109-116.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ethical warnings ==

=== Deception or manipulation ===

These are activities where the experimenters are either not disclosing their real identity, or their true purpose for the activity.  This includes assuming a [[pseudonym|false identity]] such as creating an avatar in an online game, or pretending to be a tourist while looking at statutes. This could also includes manipulating settings in order to observe reactions.

=== Observing and objectifying people by looking covertly from a distance ===

These activities concern individuals who feel that a particular population is being treated in a dispassionate manner or similar to scientists observing natural phenomena in a clinical way. Examples of this would be the exercises which you ask to observe the waiting behaviors of people in public places (either in person from a distance or via [[webcam]]).

=== Intimate or detailed observations of personal places or behavior ===

This category refers to a in-depth analysis of intimate, meaningful or personal places activities or spaces, and may include making judgments which could sadden or offend people. An example of this could be coding or commenting on gravestone trends or personal graffiti.

=== Possibility of causing discomfort or concern ===

This is a category, in which the exercise or project may upset some people, or create anxiety or fear (including and potentially, in the researcher). This may happen due to situations which could include wasting people's time or not conforming to societal norms, such as in 'breaching' experiments. The visual offers a range of exciting possibilities for social research but it also brings an array of challenges and ethical difficulties. Visual Ethics can now be regarded as a specialist area within visual methodologies. Much mainstream engagement with the ethics of visual ethnography focuses on issues of anonymity of place and participants so that the focus is on who is taking the picture, who is in the picture; and what else can be known from the geography or materiality of the image. Thus, the moral maze of image ethics has been centrally concerned with the creator of images in relation to informed consent and the tension between revealing and concealing the contents of visual images; and who has ‘the right’ to claim ownership of images to in turn edit their content and show them to others (Mannay 2016).Once a visual image is created it becomes very difficult to control its use or remove it from the public arena if participants decide that they no longer want to be represented in a fixed visual trope for time immemorial. Even if images are successfully anodised, acts to disguise images can be seen as tantamount to silencing the voice of research participants. This is particularly problematic where researchers invest in the epistemological aims of participatory approaches predicated on giving ‘voice’.

'''''Warrior Marks: Female Genital Mutilation and the Sexual Blinding of Women''''' is a 1993 book by [[Alice Walker]] with [[Pratibha Parmar]], who made an award-winning documentary of the same name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Foster|first=Gwendolyn Audrey|title=Women Filmmakers of the African &amp; Asian Diaspora: Decolonizing the Gaze, Locating Subjectivity|year=1997|publisher=Southern Illinois University Press|location=Carbondale (Ill.)|isbn=978-0-8093-2120-9|pages=91–94|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8jiBlevikccC&amp;pg=PA91 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following on from her 1992 novel ''[[Possessing the Secret of Joy]]'', Walker undertakes a journey to parts of Africa where [[clitoridectomy]] is still practised. ''Warrior Marks'' is a harrowing work as Walker interviews women who have had the operation done and finally interviews a woman&amp;mdash;circumcised herself&amp;mdash;who performs the operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McCoy|first=Frank|title=Hearing Women's Cries|journal=Black Enterprise|date=May 1994|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_lwEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA103 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Flight 90''' of the [[North American X-15]] was a [[test flight]] conducted by [[NASA]] and the [[US Air Force]] in 1963. It was the first of two X-15 missions that reached [[outer space|space]], along with [[X-15 Flight 91|Flight 91]] the next month. The X-15 was flown by [[Joseph A. Walker]], who flew both X-15 [[spaceflight]]s.

==Mission parameters==
*'''Mass:''' 15,195&amp;nbsp;kg fueled; 6,577&amp;nbsp;kg burnout; 6,260&amp;nbsp;kg landed
*'''Maximum Altitude:''' 106.01&amp;nbsp;km

==Mission highlights==
Maximum Speed - 5,971&amp;nbsp;km/h. Maximum Altitude - 106,010 m. 80&amp;nbsp;cm diameter balloon towed on 30 m line to measure air density. First X-15 flight over 100&amp;nbsp;km (a height known as the [[Kármán line]]). This made Walker the first US civilian in space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.space.com/adastra/adastra_joewalker_061127.html|title=Higher &amp; Faster: Memorial Fund Established for X-15 pilot |first=Larry |last=Evans|work=TechMediaNetwork |publisher=Space.com |date=November 27, 2006 |accessdate=May 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was also the first [[spaceflight]] of a [[spaceplane]] in aviation history. First flight launched over Smith Dry Lake, NV. Experiments: Towed balloon, horizon scanner, photometer, infrared and ultraviolet. Balloon instrumentation failed.

The mission was flown by [[X-15]] #3, serial 56-6672 on its 21st flight.

Launched by: NB-52B #008, Pilots Fulton &amp; Bement. Takeoff: 17:19. UTC Landing: 19:04 UTC.

Chase pilots: Crews, Dana, Rogers, Daniel and Wood.

The X-15 engine burned about 85 seconds. Near the end of the burn, acceleration built up to about 4''g'' (39&amp;nbsp;m/s²). Weightlessness lasted for 3 to 5 minutes. Re-entry heating warmed the exterior of the X-15 to 650 °C in places. During pull up after re-entry, the acceleration built up to 5''g'' (49&amp;nbsp;m/s²) for 20 seconds. The entire flight lasted about 12 minutes from launch to landing.
