'''The Algatron''' was a proposed and prototyped waste filtration and recycling system to be implemented on [[NASA]] missions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Munns|first1=David|title=Engineering the Environment: Phytotrons and the Quest for Climate Control in the Cold War|publisher=University of Pittsburgh Press|pages=208}}&lt;/ref&gt; Designed and built by a pair of sanitary engineers at the [[University of California, Berkley]] [[William J. Oswald]] and [[Clarence Golueke]], the Algatron relied on algae to provide carbon Dioxide absorption and oxygen generation as well as "microbiological waste conversion" for "humans sealed within an isolated capsule.".&lt;ref&gt;Oswald, Golueke, and Horning, "Closed Ecological Systems," 45&lt;/ref&gt; A working model was built by Oswald and Golueke in 1965 or 1966 under a contract by from the Air Force Cambridge Research Laboratories.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid,. 251&lt;/ref&gt; Composed of two stacked cylinders lined with Algae, the cylinders would spin in opposite directions. With ports to allow sunlight in, nutrients (the waste and urine) were introduced via some overflow mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|title=Algatron|url=http://www.worldoftrons.com/blog/2017/2/21/algatron|website=World of Trons|accessdate=21 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the promise that the Algatron represented, and the ways in which Oswald and Golueke "understood that the closed environment of the space capsule was itself just the a microcosm of the closed system of the earth's biosphere," the technology would never get past the prototype stage. NASA instead decided to go with fecal bags to deal with waste.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Munns|first1=David|title=Engineering the Environment: Phytotrons and the Quest for Climate Control in the Cold War|publisher=University of Pittsburgh Press|pages=248}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Russians developed a similar system, the BIOS-3, which got as far enough as a successful test run with human occupants in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;ibid,. xx&lt;/ref&gt;

He was born in [[Coimbra]] and lived in the [[Alcobaça Monastery]] from 1575 to 1579. He travelled to [[Goa]] in 1580, to establish a library for his order. In 1583 he travelled overland to what is today Cambodia, where in 1586 he was the first Western visitor to Angkor. In 1589, gave an account of his impressions to the historian [[Diogo do Couto]] before being killed in a [[shipwreck]] off [[KwaZulu-Natal Province|Natal]]. He attempted to aid in a reconstruction effort of Angkor, but the project was unsuccessful.

'''Euroregion Cieszyn Silesia''' ({{lang-pl|Euroregion Śląsk Cieszyński}}, {{lang-cs|Euroregion Těšínské Slezsko}}) is one of the [[euroregion]]s (transnational co-operation structures) between [[Poland]] and [[Czech Republic]]. It has area of about 1,400 km² and more than 680,000 inhabitants. The largest cities are [[Jastrzębie Zdrój]] from Polish side and [[Havířov]] from Czech side. It was established on 22 April 1998.&lt;ref name="ulotka"&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.olza.pl%2Fpl%2Fpobierz%2Fplik%2F277%2Fulotka-informacyjna-euroregionu-slask-cieszynski-i-sriwr-olza.pdf|title=EUROREGION ŚLĄSK CIESZYŃSKI - Těšínské Slezsko W PIGUŁCE|pages=4-5|language=Polish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It comprises a large part of the historical region of [[Cieszyn Silesia]]:
* in Poland: 12 municipalities of the [[Cieszyn County]], 2 municipalities of the [[Bielsko County]] ([[gmina Jaworze|Jaworze]] and [[gmina Jasienica|Jasienica]]), 1 municipality in [[Wodzisław County]] ([[Gmina Godów|Godów]]) and [[Jastrzębie Zdrój]] (however, the last two are not part of Cieszyn Silesia).

A '''developed  country''', '''industrialized country''', '''more developed country''', or '''more economically developed country''' ('''MEDC'''), is a [[sovereign state]] that has a developed economy and advanced technological infrastructure relative to other less industrialized nations. Most commonly, the criteria for evaluating the degree of economic development are [[gross domestic product]] (GDP), [[gross national product]] (GNP), the [[per capita income]], level of industrialization, amount of widespread infrastructure and general standard of living.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/developed-economy.asp#axzz1legO8olO Developed Economy Definition] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160322201145/http://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/developed-economy.asp |date=22 March 2016 }}. Investopedia (16 April 2010). Retrieved 2013-07-12.&lt;/ref&gt; Which criteria are to be used and which countries can be classified as being developed are subjects of debate.

Developed countries have generally [[Post-industrial society|post-industrial]] economies, meaning the [[service sector]] provides more wealth than the [[industrial sector]]. They are contrasted with [[developing country|developing countries]], which are in the process of [[industrialization]] or pre-industrial and almost entirely [[Agriculture|agrarian]], some of which might fall into the category of [[Least developed country|least developed countries]]. As of 2015, advanced economies comprise 60.8% of global GDP based on [[nominal value]]s and 42.9% of global GDP based on [[purchasing power parity|purchasing-power parity]] (PPP) according to the [[International Monetary Fund]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2015/02/weodata/weorept.aspx?pr.x=30&amp;pr.y=7&amp;sy=1980&amp;ey=2016&amp;scsm=1&amp;ssd=1&amp;sort=country&amp;ds=.&amp;br=1&amp;c=001%2C110&amp;s=NGDPD%2CPPPGDP%2CPPPSH&amp;grp=1&amp;a=1 IMF GDP data (October 2015)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304041611/http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2015/02/weodata/weorept.aspx?pr.x=30&amp;pr.y=7&amp;sy=1980&amp;ey=2016&amp;scsm=1&amp;ssd=1&amp;sort=country&amp;ds=.&amp;br=1&amp;c=001%2C110&amp;s=NGDPD%2CPPPGDP%2CPPPSH&amp;grp=1&amp;a=1 |date=4 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, the ten largest advanced economies by GDP in both nominal and PPP terms were [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Italy]], [[Japan]], [[South Korea]], [[Spain]], the [[United Kingdom]], and the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2018/01/weodata/weoselco.aspx?g=110&amp;sg=All+countries+/+Advanced+economies|title=All countries/Advanced economies|website=www.imf.org|language=en-US|access-date=29 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Terms linked to the concept ''developed country'' include "advanced country", "industrialized country", "'more developed country" (MDC), "more economically developed country" (MEDC), "[[Global North]] country", "[[First World|first world]] country", and "post-industrial country". The term industrialized country may be somewhat ambiguous, as [[industrialization]] is an ongoing process that is hard to define.  The first industrialized country was the [[United Kingdom]], followed by Belgium. Later it spread further to [[Germany]], [[United States]], [[France]] and other [[Western Europe]]an countries. According to some [[economist]]s such as [[Jeffrey Sachs]], however, the current divide between the developed and [[Developing country|developing world]] is largely a phenomenon of the 20th century.&lt;!--

==Definition and criteria==
Economic criteria have tended to dominate discussions. One such criterion is income per capita; countries with high [[gross domestic product]] (GDP) per capita would thus be described as developed countries.  Another economic criterion is [[industrialization]]; countries in which the [[tertiary sector of industry|tertiary]] and [[quaternary sector of industry|quaternary sectors of industry]] dominate would thus be described as developed. More recently another measure, the [[Human Development Index]] (HDI), which combines an economic measure, national income, with other measures, indices for life expectancy and education has become prominent. This criterion would define developed countries as those with a very high (HDI) rating.  The index, however, does not take into account several factors, such as the [[List of countries by wealth per adult|net wealth per capita]] or the relative [[Quality (business)|quality of goods]] in a country. This situation tends to lower the ranking for some of the most advanced countries, such as the [[G7]] members and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R2D0AAAAMAAJ|title=The Courier|date=1994|publisher=Commission of the European Communities|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.economicshelp.org/blog/glossary/human-development-index/|title=Human development index - Economics  Help|work=Economics  Help|access-date=2018-09-23|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[United Nations Statistics Division]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;There is no established convention for the designation of "developed" and "developing" countries or areas in the [[United Nations]] system.&lt;ref name="unstated.un.org"&gt;{{cite web |title=Millennium Development Indicators: World and regional groupings |url=https://unstats.un.org/unsd/mi/worldmillennium.htm |publisher=[[United Nations Statistics Division]] |date=2003 |at=Note b |accessdate=13 May 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050210031555/http://unstats.un.org/unsd/mi/worldmillennium.htm |archivedate=10 February 2005 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

And it notes that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The designations "developed" and "developing" are intended for statistical convenience and do not necessarily express a judgement about the stage reached by a particular country or area in the development process.&lt;ref name="unstats.un.org"&gt;{{Cite web |title=Standard Country and Area Codes Classifications (M49): Developed Regions |url=http://unstats.un.org/unsd/methods/m49/m49.htm |publisher=[[United Nations Statistics Division]] |access-date=13 May 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170711220015/https://unstats.un.org/unsd/methods/m49/m49.htm |archivedate=11 July 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Human Development Index (HDI)==
{{Main article|Human Development Index|List of countries by Human Development Index}}
The UN HDI is a statistical measure that gauges a country's level of human development. While there is a strong correlation between having a high HDI score and a prosperous economy, the UN points out that the HDI accounts for more than income or productivity. Unlike GDP per capita or per capita income, the HDI takes into account how income is turned "into education and health opportunities and therefore into higher levels of human development."

Since 1990, [[Norway]] (2001–2006, 2009–2017), [[Japan]] (1990–1991 and 1993), [[Canada]] (1992 and 1994–2000) and [[Iceland]] (2007–2008) have had the highest HDI score.

As a non-UN member, the government of [[Taiwan]] calculates its own HDI, which had a value of 0.882 in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stat.gov.tw/public/Data/1112116124371.pdf|format=PDF|title=2011中華民國人類發展指數 (HDI)|accessdate=21 November 2011|year=2011|publisher=Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics, Executive Yuan, R.O.C.|language=Chinese|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111226052702/http://www.stat.gov.tw/public/Data/1112116124371.pdf|archivedate=26 December 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, while the HDI for the Chinese [[special administrative region]] of Hong Kong is calculated by the UN, it is not for [[Macau]]. The Macanese government calculated the territory's HDI to be 0.868 in 2011. These values place both Taiwan and Macau well within the list of countries with "Very high human development".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dsec.gov.mo/getAttachment/1310df1c-dce8-4ff6-ba83-4a56ad187ca2/E_MN_PUB_2013_Y.aspx Macau in Figures, 2013] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131024055449/http://www.dsec.gov.mo/getAttachment/1310df1c-dce8-4ff6-ba83-4a56ad187ca2/E_MN_PUB_2013_Y.aspx |date=24 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, in 2009 a United Nations project calculated the HDI for all of its members, as well as Taiwan, Macau, and many [[dependent territory|dependent territories]]. The HDI values for the countries of [[San Marino]] and [[Monaco]], which have not been included in official annual HDI reports, were found to be at 0.961 and 0.956 respectively. This places both countries firmly within the category of countries with "Very high human development" as well. The dependent territories with HDI values equivalent to "Very high human development" were: [[Jersey]], [[Cayman Islands]], [[Bermuda]], [[Guernsey]], [[Gibraltar]], [[Norfolk Island]], [[Faroe Islands]], [[Isle of Man]], [[British Virgin Islands]], [[Falkland Islands]], [[Aruba]], [[Puerto Rico]], [[Martinique]], [[Greenland]], and [[Guam]].&lt;ref name="UN Escap"&gt;[http://www.unescap.org/sites/default/files/wp-09-02.pdf Filling Gaps in the Human Development Index] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305012014/http://www.unescap.org/sites/default/files/wp-09-02.pdf |date=5 March 2016 }}, United Nations ESCAP, February 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Of note, the HDI values in the 2009 report were calculated using the old HDI formula, while HDI values after the year 2010 are calculated with a different formula.

==High-income economies==
Some institutions have produced lists of developed countries: the UN (list shown above), the CIA,&lt;ref name=cia&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/appendix/appendix-b.html|title=Appendix B.

[[File:Picswiss AI-04-02.jpg|thumb|300px|Dispersed settlement or ''Streusiedlung'' in [[Brülisau]], [[Appenzell Innerrhoden]], [[Switzerland]]]]
A '''dispersed settlement''', also known as a '''scattered settlement''', is one of the main types of [[Human settlement|settlement]] patterns used by [[Landscape history|landscape historians]] to classify [[rural]] settlements found in [[England]] and other parts of the world.  Typically, there are a number of separate farmsteads scattered throughout the area.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Muir, ''The NEW Reading the Landscape'', University of Exeter Press&lt;/ref&gt; A dispersed settlement contrasts with a [[nucleated village]].

The French term ''[[bocage]]'' is sometimes used to describe the type of landscape found where dispersed settlements are common.

In addition to Western Europe, dispersed patterns of settlement are found in parts of [[Papua New Guinea]], as among the Gainj, Ankave, and Baining tribes. It is also frequently met with in normadic pastoral societies.

==England==
In England, dispersed settlements are often found in the areas of ancient enclosure outside the central region—for example, [[Essex]], [[Kent]] and the [[West Country]].&lt;ref&gt;Roberts &amp; Rathmell, ''An Atlas of Rural Settlement in England'', English Heritage&lt;/ref&gt; An example of a dispersed settlement given by [[William George Hoskins|W G Hoskins]] is [[Middle Barton]] in [[Steeple Barton]], [[Oxfordshire]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Making of the English Landscape''. However, he uses the term "fragmented village".&lt;/ref&gt; 

In some parts of England, the pattern of dispersed settlement has remained unchanged for many hundreds of years. Many of the locations found in [[Domesday]] may be dispersed farmsteads.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.tvg.bham.ac.uk/laxton/TTSN2002.pdf Keith Challis, Settlement Morphology and Medieval Planning] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006080936/http://www.tvg.bham.ac.uk/laxton/TTSN2002.pdf |date=October 6, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is sometimes possible to identify documentary references to farmsteads in the 18th or 19th centuries with these Domesday entries.&lt;ref&gt;[[William George Hoskins|W G Hoskins]], ''Fieldwork in Local History''&lt;/ref&gt;

In areas of Kent and Essex close to London, development of residential housing during the 20th century has often disguised the dispersed nature of the original settlement.

The farmsteads which make up the dispersed settlement are often surrounded by small irregularly shaped fields.  Traditionally, trees are encouraged to grow at the edges of these fields and in thin strips alongside roads. However, during the 20th century, much of this woodland disappeared, either as a result of disease or modern farming practice. [[Arthur Young (writer)|Arthur Young]]'s description of the view from [[Langdon Hills]], "dark lanes intersected with numberless hedges and woods,"&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Young, ''A Six Weeks' Tour through the Southern Counties of England and Wales''&lt;/ref&gt; is a typical description of the landscape in an area of dispersed settlements.

==Italy==
Anthony Galt has written an extensive study of the dispersed settlement pattern around [[Locorotondo]] in the [[Province of Bari]] in southern Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Galt, ''Far from the Church Bells'' (CUP, 1991)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;D. Curtis, https://www.academia.edu/1933250/Is_there_an_agro-town_model_for_Southern_Italy_Exploring_the_diverse_roots_and_development_of_the_agro-town_structure_through_a_comparative_case_study_in_Apulia&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, the settlement pattern developed because of movement from the town to the countryside in the 19th century. [[Emphyteutic lease]]s were used by landowners seeking to increase their income from land that was only marginally attractive for agriculture by encouraging the creation of [[vineyard]]s.

==German-speaking Europe==
{{see|Talschaft}}
Known as ''Streusiedlungen'' (singular ''Streusiedlung''), dispersed settlements are a characteristic of various parts of [[German-speaking Europe]], including in areas of [[Westphalia]], historically the [[Ruhr]] urban area (the dispersed settlements lending themselves to the development of [[urban sprawl]] after industrialisation), the Austro-Bavarian parts of the [[valleys of the Alps|Alps]] ([[Upper Bavaria]], [[Austria]], [[South Tyrol]]) as well as [[Alamanni|Alamannic]] parts of the Alps ([[Bernese Oberland]], [[Central Switzerland]], [[Grisons]]).

'''Dublin Hills Regional Park''' covers {{convert|654|acres|m2}} in [[Alameda County, California]], west of the city of [[Dublin, California|Dublin]]. It is part of the [[East Bay Regional Park District]] (EBRPD). The park is accessible from the Donlon Hill Staging Area, which is on Dublin Boulevard near Dublin, California.

==Geography==
Dublin Hills Regional Park is largely undeveloped and serves primarily as wildlife habitat. There are several trails within the park that serve hikers, bikers and equestrians. However, there are no reservable campsites or picnic sites.
The most notable geographic feature in the park is a ridge which starts at Donlon Point, on the southern boundary of the park, and runs northward to Wiedeman Hill, which lies outside the northern boundary. The ridge acts as an open space corridor through the park, although it is intespersed with steep canyons.&lt;ref name="EBRPD-DH"/&gt; 

=== Boundaries ===
The park is bounded on the south by I-580, Schaefer Ranch on the southwest, private grazing land to the northwest, north and northeast and the California Highlands on the southeast.&lt;ref name="EBRPD-DH"&gt;[http://www.ebparks.org/parks/dublin_hills "Dublin Hills Regional Park."  East Bay Regional Park District.] Accessed August 22, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hiking ===
The main trail in the park, the 2-mile Calaveras Ridge Regional Trail, follows the Calaveras Ridge into the Dublin Hills. Towards the end of the trail, the Calaveras Ridge merges with higher mountains, and the trail divides, both parts coming to an end at private property shortly after.

The Calaveras Trail does not climb to the top of Donlon Point. To climb Donlon Point, a 1/3-mile trail must be taken to the top of this hill.

A network of short trails (the Donlon Loop Trail) leads to a housing development along Dublin Boulevard. Hikers are not allowed to park in this housing development. A loop can be made with this network of short trails, although this route is too narrow for cyclists and equestrians. A further Martin Canyon Creek Trail, which connects to both the Donlon Loop Trail and the Calaveras Ridge Trail, goes in the direction of the Martin Canyon Creek Trail open space.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ebparks.org/parks/dublin_hills#trail_map|title=Dublin Hills Regional Park|website=www.ebparks.org|access-date=2017-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other minor trails come to [[Dead end (street)|dead-ends]] at the edges of the park.

== History ==
According to the Dublin Hills Regional Park map, some of the grasslands in Dublin Hills Regional Park have not been touched by man since the 1800s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ebparks.org/Assets/_Nav_Categories/Parks/Maps/Dublin+Hills+text.pdf|title=Dublin Hills Map Text Side|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the Dublin Hills area, like [[Vargas Plateau Regional Park|Vargas Plateau]], was originally ranchland.

At its opening in July 2010, the park covered 520 acres. EBRPD had bought about {{convert|400|acres|m2}} of land for $2.3 million, while developers contributed {{convert|120|acres|m2}}.&lt;ref name="BANG"&gt;[http://www.eastbaytimes.com/2010/07/19/new-dublin-hills-regional-park-to-open-thursday-on-520-acres/ Cuff, Denis. "New Dublin Hills Regional Park to open Thursday on 520 acres." Bay Area News Group. July 19, 2010. Updated August 15, 2016.] Accessed August 22, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

In September, 2015, EBRPD announced that it had bought a {{convert|362|acre|km2}} parcel of land on the northern boundary of the Dublin Hills park that was owned by the Wiedemann Ranch. This parcel would become part of [[Bishop Ranch Regional Preserve|Bishop Ranch Open Space Reserve]] and would connect the Bishop Ranch preserve with the Dublin Hills park.&lt;ref name="Bauer"&gt;[https://danvillesanramon.com/news/2015/09/06/ebrpd-buys-land-in-san-ramon-valley-to-connect-popular-parks-trails Bauer, Meredith.

The earliest known  [[world map]]s date to [[classical antiquity]], the oldest examples of the 6th to 5th centuries BCE still based on the [[flat Earth]] paradigm.
World maps assuming a [[spherical Earth]] first appear in the [[Hellenistic period]].
The developments of [[Greek geography]] during this time, notably by [[Eratosthenes]] and [[Posidonius]] culminated in the Roman era, with [[Ptolemy world map|Ptolemy's world map]] (2nd century CE), which would remain authoritative throughout the [[Middle Ages]].

Since Ptolemy, knowledge of the approximate size of the globe allowed cartographers to estimate the extent of their geographical knowledge, and to indicate parts of the globe known to exist but not yet explored as ''[[terra incognita]]''.
With the [[Age of Discovery]], during the 15th to 18th centuries, world maps became increasingly accurate; exploration of [[Antarctica]] and the [[exploration of Africa|interior of Africa]] by western mapmakers was left to the 19th and early 20th century.

===Babylonian ''Imago Mundi'' (ca. 6th c. BCE)===
{{Main|Babylonian Map of the World}}
A Babylonian world map, known as the ''Imago Mundi'', is commonly dated to the 6th century BCE.&lt;ref name=BM92687&gt;[http://britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=362000&amp;partId=1 British Museum Inv. No.92687]: "6thC BC approx".
see also: Siebold, Jim [http://www.henry-davis.com/MAPS/Ancient%20Web%20Pages/103.html Slide 103] via henry-davis.com - accessed 2008-02-04. 
First published 1899, formerly also dated to an earlier period, {{circa|lk=no|900}} BCE. {{citation|title=Geography and Ethnography: Perceptions of the World in Pre-Modern Societies|author=Kurt A. Raaflaub &amp; Richard J. A. Talbert|publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]]|year=2009|isbn=1-4051-9146-5|page=147}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The map as reconstructed by [[Eckhard Unger]] shows [[Babylon]] on the [[Euphrates]], surrounded by a circular landmass showing [[Assyria]], [[Urartu]] ([[Armenia]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |jstor=1151277 |title=Imago Mundi's Logo the Babylonian Map of the World |first=Catherine Delano |last=Smith |journal=Imago Mundi |volume=48 |year=1996 |pages=209–211 |doi=10.1080/03085699608592846}}&lt;/ref&gt; and several cities, in turn surrounded by a "bitter river" ([[Oceanus]]), with eight outlying regions (''nagu'') arranged around it in the shape of triangles, so as to form a star. The accompanying text mentions a distance of seven ''beru'' between the outlying regions.
The descriptions of five of them have survived:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Irving|last=Finel|title=A join to the map of the world: A notable discover|year=1995|pages=26–27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*on the fourth region "the light is brighter than that of sunset or stars": it lay in the northwest, and after sunset in summer was practically in semi-obscurity.
*The fifth region, due north, lay in complete darkness, a land "where one sees nothing," and "the sun is not visible."
*the sixth region, "where a horned bull dwells and attacks the newcomer"
*the seventh region lay in the east and is "where the morning dawns."
A final paragraph summarises,  "In all eight "regions" (nagu) of the four shores (kibrati) of the ea[rth ...], their interior no-one knows".&lt;ref name=BM92687/&gt;

===Anaximander (c. 610&amp;nbsp;– 546 BCE)===
[[File:Anaximander world map-en.svg|thumb|150px|Reconstruction of Anaximander's map]]
[[Anaximander]] (died c. 546 BCE) is credited with having created one of the first maps of the world,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.henry-davis.com/MAPS/AncientWebPages/104.html Timechart of historical cartography: Antiquity]&lt;/ref&gt; which was circular in form and showed the known lands of the world grouped around the [[Aegean Sea]] at the center. This was all surrounded by the ocean.

===Hecataeus of Miletus (c. 550–476 BCE)===
[[File:Hecataeus world map-en.svg|thumb|left|150px|Reconstruction of Hecataeus' map]]
[[Hecataeus of Miletus]] (died {{circa|lk=no|476}} BCE) is credited with a work entitled ''Ges Periodos'' ("Travels round the Earth" or "World Survey'), in two books each organized in the manner of a ''[[periplus]]'', a point-to-point coastal survey. One on [[Europe]], is essentially a periplus of the Mediterranean, describing each region in turn, reaching as far north as [[Scythia]]. The other book, on [[Asia]], is arranged similarly to the ''[[Periplus of the Erythraean Sea]]'' of which a version of the 1st century CE survives. Hecataeus described the countries and inhabitants of the known world, the account of [[Egypt]] being particularly comprehensive; the descriptive matter was accompanied by a [[map]], based upon [[Anaximander]]'s map of the earth, which he corrected and enlarged. The work only survives in some 374 fragments, by far the majority being quoted in the geographical lexicon ''Ethnika'' compiled by [[Stephanus of Byzantium]].

===Eratosthenes (276–194 BCE)===
[[File:Mappa di Eratostene.jpg|thumb|150px|1883 reconstruction of [[Eratosthenes]]' map&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.henry-davis.com/MAPS/Ancient%20Web%20Pages/112.html Source]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[Eratosthenes]] (276–194 BCE) drew an improved world map, incorporating information from the campaigns of [[Alexander the Great]] and his successors. [[Asia]] became wider, reflecting the new understanding of the actual size of the continent. Eratosthenes was also the first geographer to incorporate parallels and meridians within his cartographic depictions, attesting to his understanding of the spherical nature of the earth.

===Posidonius (c. 150–130 BCE)===
[[File:Worldmaphedo.jpg|thumb|150px|A 1628 reconstruction of [[Posidonius]] ideas about the positions of continents (many details couldn't have been known by Posidonius)]]
{{Main|Posidonius}}
[[Posidonius]] (or Poseidonius) of [[Apamea (Syria)|Apameia]] (c. 135–51 BCE), was a Greek [[Stoicism|Stoic]] philosopher&lt;ref&gt;[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] [http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9061021/Poseidonius "Greek philosopher, considered the most learned man of his time and, possibly, of the entire Stoic school."]&lt;/ref&gt; who traveled throughout the Roman world and beyond and was a celebrated [[polymath]] throughout the Greco-Roman world, like [[Aristotle]] and [[Eratosthenes]]. His work "about the ocean and the adjacent areas" was a general geographical discussion, showing how all the forces had an effect on each other and applied also to human life. He measured the [[Earth]]'s circumference by reference to the position of the star [[Canopus (star)|Canopus]]. His measure of 240,000 [[stadion (unit of length)|stadia]] translates to {{Convert|24,000|mi|}}, close to the actual circumference of {{Convert|24,901|mi|}}.&lt;ref&gt;Poseidonius, [http://www.attalus.org/translate/poseidonius.html#202.K fragment 202]&lt;/ref&gt;
He was informed in his approach by Eratosthenes, who a century earlier used the elevation of the Sun at different latitudes. Both men's figures for the Earth's circumference were uncannily accurate, aided in each case by mutually compensating errors in measurement. However, the version of Posidonius' calculation popularised by [[Strabo]] was revised by correcting the distance between Rhodes and Alexandria to 3,750 stadia, resulting in a circumference of 180,000 stadia, or {{Convert|18,000|mi|}}.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Lloyd Arnold [https://books.google.com/books?id=Qh7nDfGm7BkC&amp;pg=PA30&amp;lpg=PA30#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The Story of Maps] Dover Publications (1979) pp29-31&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ptolemy]] discussed and favored this revised figure of Posidonius over Eratosthenes in his ''Geographia'', and during the [[Middle Ages]] scholars divided into two camps regarding the circumference of the Earth, one side identifying with Eratosthenes' calculation and the other with Posidonius' 180,000 stadion measure.
{{clear}}

===Strabo (c. 64 BCE – 24 CE)===
{{Main|Strabo|Geographica}}
Strabo is mostly famous for his 17-volume work ''Geographica'', which presented a descriptive history of people and places from different regions of the world known to his era.&lt;ref name="SG17"&gt;''Strabonis Geographica'', Book 17, Chapter 7.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Geographica'' first appeared in Western Europe in Rome as a Latin translation issued around 1469. Although Strabo referenced the antique Greek astronomers Eratosthenes and [[Hipparchus]] and acknowledged their astronomical and mathematical efforts towards geography, he claimed that a descriptive approach was more practical. ''Geographica'' provides a valuable source of information on the ancient world, especially when this information is corroborated by other sources. Within the books of ''Geographica'' is a map of Europe. Whole world maps according to Strabo are reconstructions from his written text.

===Pomponius Mela (c. 43 CE)===
[[File:Karte Pomponius Mela rotated.jpg|thumb|150px|An 1898 reconstruction of [[Pomponius Mela]]s view of the World.]]
{{Main|Pomponius Mela}}
Pomponius is unique among ancient geographers in that, after dividing the earth into five zones, of which two only were habitable, he asserts the existence of [[antichthones]], people inhabiting the southern temperate zone inaccessible to the folk of the northern temperate regions due to the unbearable heat of the intervening torrid belt. On the divisions and boundaries of [[Europe]], [[Asia]] and [[Africa]], he repeats Eratosthenes; like all classical geographers from [[Alexander the Great]] (except [[Ptolemy]]) he regards the [[Caspian Sea]] as an inlet of the Northern Ocean, corresponding to the Persian ([[Persian Gulf]]) and Arabian ([[Red Sea]]) gulfs on the south.

===Marinus of Tyre (c. 120 CE)===
{{Main|Marinus of Tyre}}
Marinus of Tyre's world maps were the first in the [[Roman Empire]] to show [[China]]. Around 120 CE, Marinus wrote that the habitable world was bounded on the west by the [[Fortunate Islands]]. The text of his geographical treatise however is lost. He also invented the [[equirectangular projection]], which is still used in map creation today. A few of Marinus' opinions are reported by Ptolemy. Marinus was of the opinion that the ''[[Oceanus|Okeanos]]'' was separated into an eastern and a western part by the continents ([[Europe]], [[Asia]] and [[Africa]]). He thought that the inhabited world stretched in latitude from [[Thule]] ([[Shetland]]) to [[Agisymba]] ([[Tropic of Capricorn]]) and in longitude from the [[Isles of the Blessed]] to [[China|Shera (China)]]. Marinus also coined the term [[Antarctic]], referring to the opposite of the [[Arctic Circle]]. His chief legacy is that he first assigned to each place a proper [[latitude]] and [[longitude]]; he used a "Meridian of the [[Isles of the Blessed]] ([[Canary Islands]] or [[Cape Verde Islands]])" as the [[zero meridian]].

===Ptolemy (c. 150)===
[[File:Ptolemy-World Vat Urb 82.jpg|right|thumb|200px|The oldest surviving [[Ptolemy's world map|Ptolemaic world map]], redrawn according to his 1st projection by [[Orthodox monasticism|monks]] at [[Constantinople]] under [[Maximus Planudes]] around 1300]]

{{Main|Ptolemy world map}}&lt;!--more sources at linked articles--&gt;
Surviving texts of [[Claudius Ptolemy|Ptolemy]]'s ''[[Ptolemy's Geography|Geography]]'', first composed {{circa|lk=no|150}}, note that he continued the use of Marinus's equirectangular projection for its regional maps while finding it inappropriate for maps of the [[Ecumene|entire known world]]. Instead, in Book VII of his work, he outlines three separate projections of increasing difficulty and fidelity. Ptolemy followed Marinus in underestimating the circumference of the world; combined with accurate absolute distances, this led him to also overestimate the length of the [[Mediterranean Sea]] in terms of [[degree of arc|degrees]]. His [[prime meridian]] at the [[Fortunate Isles]] was therefore around 10 actual degrees further west of [[Alexandria]] than intended, a mistake that was corrected by [[Book of the Description of the Earth|Al-Khwārizmī]] following the translation of [[Syriac language|Syriac]] editions of Ptolemy into [[Classical Arabic|Arabic]] in the 9th century. The oldest surviving manuscripts of the work date to [[Maximus Planudes]]'s restoration of the text a little before 1300 at [[Chora Monastery]] in [[Constantinople]] ([[Istanbul]]); surviving manuscripts from this era seem to preserve separate recensions of the text which diverged as early as the 2nd or 4th century. A passage in some of the recensions credits an [[Agathodaemon (cartographer)|Agathodaemon]] with drafting a world map, but no maps seem to have survived to be used by Planude's monks. Instead, he commissioned new world maps calculated from Ptolemy's thousands of coordinates and drafted according to the text's 1st&lt;ref&gt;Vat. Urbinas Graecus 82.&lt;/ref&gt; and 2nd projections,&lt;ref&gt;Codex Seragliensis GI 57&lt;/ref&gt; along with the equirectangular regional maps. A copy was translated into [[Latin]] by [[Jacobus Angelus]] at [[Republic of Florence|Florence]] around 1406 and soon supplemented with maps on the 1st projection. Maps using the 2nd projection were not made in Western Europe until [[Nicolaus Germanus]]'s 1466 edition.{{refn|name=snyd|{{Citation |last=Snyder |first=John P. |title=Flattening the Earth: Two Thousand Years of Map Projections |p=14 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0UzjTJ4w9yEC&amp;pg=PA14 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago |date=1993}}}} Ptolemy's 3rd (and hardest) projection does not seem to have been used at all before [[Age of Discovery|new discoveries]] expanded the known world beyond the point where it provided a useful format.&lt;ref name=snyd/&gt;

[[Cicero]]'s ''[[Dream of Scipio]]'' described the Earth as a globe of insignificant size in comparison to the remainder of the cosmos. Many medieval manuscripts of [[Macrobius]]' ''Commentary on the Dream of Scipio'' include maps of the Earth, including the [[antipodes]], zonal maps showing the [[Clime#Ptolemy|Ptolemaic climate]]s derived from the concept of a spherical Earth and a diagram showing the Earth (labeled as ''globus terrae'', the sphere of the Earth) at the center of the hierarchically ordered planetary spheres.&lt;ref&gt;B. Eastwood and G. Graßhoff, ''Planetary Diagrams for Roman Astronomy in Medieval Europe, ca. 800-1500'', ''Transactions of the American Philosophical Society'', 94, 3 (Philadelphia, 2004), pp. 49-50.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Macrobius, ''Commentary on the Dream of Scipio'', transl.

===Tabula Peutingeriana (4th century)===
The [[Tabula Peutingeriana]] (''Peutinger table'') is an [[itinerarium]] showing the ''[[cursus publicus]]'', the road network in the [[Roman Empire]]. It is a 13th-century copy of an original map dating from the 4th century, covering [[Europe]], parts of [[Asia]] ([[India]]) and North-[[Africa]]. The map is named after [[Konrad Peutinger]], a German 15th-16th-century humanist and antiquarian. The map was discovered in a library in [[Worms, Germany|Worms]] by [[Conrad Celtes]], who was unable to publish his find before his death, and bequeathed the map in 1508 to Peutinger. It is conserved at the [[Österreichische Nationalbibliothek]], [[Hofburg]], Vienna.

===Cosmas Indicopleustes' map (6th century)===
Around 550 [[Cosmas Indicopleustes]] wrote the copiously illustrated ''[[Christian Topography]]'', a work partly based on his personal experiences as a merchant on the Red Sea and Indian Ocean in the early 6th century. Though his [[cosmogony]] is refuted by modern science, he has given a historic description of India and [[Sri Lanka]] during the 6th century, which is invaluable to historians. Cosmas seems to have personally visited the Kingdom of [[Axum]] in modern [[Ethiopia]] and [[Eritrea]], as well as [[India]] and [[Sri Lanka]]. In 522 CE, he visited the [[Malabar Coast]] (South India). A major feature of his ''Topography'' is Cosmas' worldview that the [[world]] is [[flat earth|flat]], and that the [[sky|heavens]] form the shape of a box with a curved lid, a view he took from unconventional interpretations of [[Christian]] [[scripture]]. Cosmas aimed to prove that pre-Christian geographers had been wrong in asserting that the earth was spherical and that it was in fact modelled on the tabernacle, the house of worship described to Moses by God during the Jewish Exodus from Egypt.

The medieval [[T and O map]]s originate with the description of the world in the ''[[Etymologiae]]'' of [[Isidore of Sevilla]] (died 636). This qualitative and conceptual type of medieval [[cartography]] represents only the top-half of a spherical Earth.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Livingston, [http://www.strangehorizons.com/2002/20020610/medieval_maps.shtml Modern Medieval Map Myths: The Flat World, Ancient Sea-Kings, and Dragons] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060209042605/http://www.strangehorizons.com/2002/20020610/medieval_maps.shtml |date=2006-02-09 }}, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; It was presumably tacitly considered a convenient [[map projection|projection]] of the inhabited portion of the world known in Roman and Medieval times (that is, the [[clime|northern temperate]] half of the globe). The ''T'' is the [[Mediterranean]], dividing the three [[continent]]s, [[Asia]], [[Europe]] and [[Africa]], and the ''O'' is the surrounding [[Ocean]]. [[Jerusalem]] was generally represented in the center of the map. Asia was typically the size of the other two continents combined. Because the sun rose in the east, Paradise (the Garden of Eden) was generally depicted as being in Asia, and Asia was situated at the top portion of the map.

[[File:Cotton world map.jpg|thumb|150px|The Anglo-Saxon 'Cotton' world map (c. 1040).]]

===Anglo-Saxon ''Cotton'' world map (c. 1040)===
This map appears in a copy of a classical work on geography, the Latin version by [[Priscian]] of the ''Periegesis'', that was among the manuscripts in the [[Cotton library]] ([[MS. Tiberius]] B.V., fol. 56v), now in the [[British Library]]. It is not intended purely as an illustration to that work, for it contains much material gathered from other sources, including some which would have been the most up-to-date available, although it is based on a distant Roman original (similar to the source of [//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9e/Isidore-Seville-mappamundi.jpg another 11th-century world map], illustrating an edition of Isidore of Seville)—on which the network of lines appears to indicate the boundaries of [[Roman Empire|imperial]] provinces. The  date of drawing was formerly estimated at about CE 992–994, based on suggested links to the journey of [[Sigeric the Serious|Archbishop Sigeric of Canterbury]] from Rome&lt;ref&gt;Siebold, Jim [http://www.henry-davis.com/MAPS/EMwebpages/210mono.html Slide 210 monograph: Cottoniana or Anglo-Saxon Map], via henry-davis.com - accessed 2008-02-04&lt;/ref&gt; but more recent analysis indicates that, although the information was revised about that time, the map was probably drawn between 1025 and 1050.&lt;ref&gt;British Library [http://www.collectbritain.co.uk/personalisation/object.cfm?uid=001COTTIBB00005U00056V00&amp;largeimage=1#largeimage Collect Britain], accessed 2008-03-14&lt;/ref&gt;

Like the later map by al-Idrisi (see below) this map is clearly outside the largely symbolic early medieval mapping tradition, but equally it is not based on the famous Ptolemaic co-ordinate system. East is at the top, but Jerusalem is not in the centre, and the Garden of Eden is nowhere to be seen. Unusually, all the waterways of Africa, not just the Red Sea, are depicted in red (mountains are green). The depiction of the far East is ambitious, including India and Taprobane (Sri Lanka)—the latter depicted according to the exaggerated classical conception of its size. Unsurprisingly, Britain itself is depicted in some detail. Great Britain, unusually by medieval standards, is shown as one island, albeit with an exaggerated Cornish promontory, and Mona, Ireland and the many Scottish islands are all indicated. The cartographer is slightly confused by Iceland, depicting it both by a version of its classical name 'Thule', north-west of Britain, and as 'Island', logically linked with Scandinavia.

An open-access high-resolution digital image of the map with place and name annotations is included among the thirteen medieval maps of the world edited in the [[Virtual Mappa]] project.

It contains one of the oldest Christian world maps as an illustration of the ''Commentary''.  Although the original manuscript and map has not survived, copies of the map survive in several of the extant manuscripts.

The map is signed by one "Richard of [[Holdingham|Haldingham]] or [[Sleaford|Lafford]]". Drawn on a single sheet of [[vellum]], it measures {{convert|158|by|133|cm|in|abbr=on}}. The writing is in black ink, with additional red and gold, and blue or green for water (with the [[Red Sea]] coloured red).

The Catalan World Atlas was produced by the [[Majorcan cartographic school]] and is attributed to [[Cresques Abraham]]. It has been in the royal library of France (now the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]]) since the time of [[Charles V of France|Charles V]]. The Catalan Atlas originally consisted of 6 vellum leaves folded down the middle painted in various colors including gold and silver. The first two leaves contain texts in [[Catalan language]] covering [[cosmography]], [[astronomy]], and [[astrology]]. These texts are accompanied by illustrations. The texts and illustration emphasize the Earth's spherical shape and the state of the known world. They also provide information to sailors on tides and how to tell time at night.

Unlike many other nautical charts, the Catalan Atlas is read with the north at the bottom. As a result of this the maps are oriented from left to right, from the Far East to the Atlantic. The first two leaves, forming the oriental portion of the Catalan Atlas, illustrate numerous religious references as well as a synthesis of medieval mappae mundi (Jerusalem located close to the centre) and the travel literature of the time, notably [[Marco Polo]]'s Book of Marvels and the Travels and Voyage of [[Sir John Mandeville]]. Many Indian and Chinese cities can be identified.

The ''Da Ming Hunyi Tu'' ({{lang-zh|s=大明混一图|l=Amalgamated Map of the Great Ming Empire}}) world map, likely made in the late 14th or the 15th century,&lt;ref&gt;
The place names on the map reflect the political situation in 1389, or the 22nd year of the reign of the [[Hongwu Emperor]]. Thus some Chinese scholars concluded that it was indeed created in 1389 or little later (Wang et al., ''Juanben caihui Daming Hunyi Tu yanjiu'' 绢本彩绘大明混一图研究 (As Regards the Da Ming Hun Yi Tu  Drawn in Colours on Stiff Silk), in: ''Zhongguo gudai dituji: Ming dai'' 中國古代地图集 明代 (An Atlas of Ancient Maps in China: The Ming dynasty (1368-1644)),  Beijing, 1994, pp. 51–55).
Others maintain that this reflects an earlier source and that the  ''Da Ming Hun Yi Tu'' itself was created much later (Miya Noriko, "Kon'itsu Kyōri Rekidai Kokuto no Zu" he no michi 「混一疆理歴代国都之図」への道, ''Mongoru jidai no shuppan bunka'' モンゴル時代の出版文化,  2006, 487–651 (pp. 511-512).&lt;/ref&gt;

Elsewhere, the map betrays a decorative rather than practical purpose, particularly in the portrayal of river systems, which form unnatural loops rarely seen on Chinese maps.

The [[Genoese map]] of 1457 is a [[world map]] that relied extensively on the account of the traveler to Asia [[Niccolo da Conti]], rather than the usual source of [[Marco Polo]].&lt;ref name="Whitfield, p.36"&gt;{{cite book |first=Peter |last=Whitfield |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W8TnAz4wHFUC&amp;pg=PA36&amp;hl=en#PPA36,M1 |title=New Found Lands: Maps in the History of Exploration |page=36 |location=New York |publisher=Routledge |year=1998 |isbn=0-415-92026-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The author is unknown, but is a more modern development than the [[Fra Mauro map|Fra Mauro world map]], less intricate and complete, with fairly good proportions given to each of the continents.  The map depicts the main landmarks of the time: [[Prester John]] in Africa, the Great Khan in China, "Xilam" (Ceylom) and Sumatra, and the design of a three-masted European ship in the [[Indian Ocean]], something which had not occurred,  suggesting that a sealane was a possibility.&lt;ref name="Whitfield, p.36" /&gt;

===Fra Mauro world map (1459)===
{{Main|Fra Mauro map}}
The '''Fra Mauro map''' was made between 1457 and 1459 by the [[Venice|Venetian]] monk [[Fra Mauro]]. It is a circular planisphere drawn on [[parchment]] and set in a wooden frame, about {{Convert|2|m|}} in diameter.
The original world map was made by Fra Mauro and his assistant Andrea Bianco, a sailor-cartographer, under a commission by king [[Afonso V of Portugal]]. The map was completed on April 24, 1459, and sent to [[Portugal]], but did not survive to the present day. Fra Mauro died the next year while he was making a copy of the map for the Seignory of Venice, and the copy was completed by Andrea Bianco.

The map is preserved in the [[Museo Correr]] in [[Venice, Italy|Venice]].

===Martellus world map (1490)===
The world map of [[Henricus Martellus Germanus]] (Heinrich Hammer), c. 1490, was remarkably similar to the terrestrial globe later produced by [[Martin Behaim]] in 1492, the ''[[Erdapfel]]''. Both show heavy influences from [[Ptolemy]], and both possibly derive from maps created around 1485 in Lisbon by [[Bartolomeo Columbus]]. Although Martellus is believed to have been born in Nuremberg, Behaim's home town, he lived and worked in Florence from 1480 to 1496.

{{Main|Erdapfel}}
The ''Erdapfel'' ({{lang-de|earth apple}}) produced by [[Martin Behaim]] in 1492 is considered to be the oldest surviving terrestrial [[globe]]. It is constructed of a laminated linen ball reinforced with wood and overlaid with a [[map]] painted by [[Georg Glockendon]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://nuernberg.bayern-online.de/die-stadt/wissenswertes/der-behaim-globus/ Behaim Globe at Bayern-online]&lt;/ref&gt; The Americas are not included yet, as [[Voyages of Christopher Columbus|Columbus]] returned to Spain no sooner than March 1493. It shows a rather enlarged Eurasian continent and an empty ocean between Europe and Asia. The [[Caribbean]] islands may already be represented as well, even before Colombus's return, under the name of the mythical [[Saint Brendan's Island]]. Japan and Asian islands are disproportionately large.  The idea to call the globe "apple" may be related to the [[Reichsapfel]] ("Imperial Apple", [[Globus cruciger]]) which was also kept in Nuremberg along with the [[Imperial Regalia]] ([[Reichskleinodien]]). In 1907, it was transferred to the [[Germanic Museum]] in [[Nuremberg]].

The ''[[Cantino planisphere]]'' or Cantino world map is the earliest surviving map showing [[Portugal|Portuguese]] discoveries in the east and west. It is named after Alberto Cantino, an agent for the  [[Ercole I d'Este, Duke of Ferrara|Duke of Ferrara]], who successfully smuggled it from Portugal to [[Italy]] in 1502. It shows the islands of the [[Caribbean]] and the [[Florida]] coastline, as well as Africa, Europe and Asia. The map is particularly notable for portraying a fragmentary record of the [[Brazil]]ian coast, discovered in 1500 by Portuguese explorer [[Pedro Álvares Cabral]] who conjectured whether it was merely an island &lt;ref&gt;Letter of Pero Vaz de Caminha, ''beijo as maãos de vosa alteza. deste porto seguro da vosa jlha da vera cruz'' (see original letter in archaic Portuguese, [http://pt.wikisource.org/wiki/Carta_a_El_Rei_D._Manuel_(ortografia_original) in the Portuguese Wikisource project): ''I kiss Your Majesty's Hands, from this safe haven of your island of Vera Cruz]&lt;/ref&gt; or part of the continent that several [[Spain|Spanish]] expeditions had just encountered farther north (cf.

[[File:Caverio Map circa 1506.jpg|thumb|150px|Caverio Map (c.1505), Bibliothèque Nationale de France, Paris]]
{{Main|Caverio map}}
The [[Caverio Map]], also known as the Caveri Map or Canerio Map, is a map drawn by [[Nicolay de Caveri]], circa 1505. It is hand drawn on parchment and coloured, being composed of ten sections or panels, measuring {{convert|2.25|by|1.15|m|ft}}. Historians believe that this undated map signed with "Nicolay de Caveri Januensis" was completed in 1504–05. It was probably either made in [[Lisbon]] by the Genoese Canveri, or copied by him in [[Genoa]] from the very similar [[Cantino map]]. It shows the east coast of [[North America]] with surprising detail and was one of the primary sources used to make the [[Waldseemüller map]] in 1507. The Caverio map is currently at [[Bibliothèque Nationale de France]] in Paris.

===Ruysch World Map (1507)===
[[File:Ruysch map.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Johannes Ruysch|Ruysch]]'s 1507 map of the world]]
[[Johannes Ruysch]] an explorer, cartographer, astronomer and painter from the [[Low Countries]] produced the second oldest known printed representation of the New World.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Ruysch World Map: Census and Commentary |first=Donald L., Jr. |last=McGuirk |journal=Imago Mundi |volume=41 |issue=1 |year=1989 |pages=133–141 |jstor= |doi=10.1080/03085698908592674 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ruysch map was published and widely distributed in 1507. It uses [[Ptolemy]]'s coniform projection, as does the [[Contarini-Rosselli]] 1506 map. Both document [[Christopher Columbus]]' discoveries as well as that of [[John Cabot]], including information from Portuguese sources and [[Marco Polo]]'s account.  There are notes on his map that clearly were from Portuguese sources. [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] and [[Cuba]] are shown connected to Asia, as [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]] and [[John Cabot|Cabot]] believed. “Sipganus” (Marco Polo’s Japan) is identical with “Spagnola” ([[Hispaniola]]) on the Ruysch map. The presence of codfish is noted on the Ruysch map in the area of the [[Grand Banks]] of [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] and shows the discoveries the Portuguese had made along the African coast and shows India as a triangular peninsula with Ceylon in the correct proportion and position.
Greenland is shown connected to Newfoundland and Asia on Ruysch's map, and not Europe as earlier maps had showed. Around the north pole, Ruysch drew islands, based on reports in the book ''[[Inventio Fortunata]]'' of the English friar [[Nicholas of Lynne]]. The island above Norway shows remarkable similarities to [[Svalbard]], which was not discovered until 1597 (by [[Willem Barents]]).  Ruysch calls it 'European Hyberborea' and a peninsula stretching out towards it is clearly marked with the church of 'Sancti Odulfi', St Olaf's church in [[Vardø]] on the [[Finnmark]] coast.

The cartographers [[Martin Waldseemüller]] and [[Matthias Ringmann]] from southern Germany, supported by the mapping friend [[René II, Duke of Lorraine]], collected map data over several years, including information on the most recent discoveries, to build up a new collective work of geography and cartography. Along with a book they further incorporated, for the first time in history, the name ''America'' on a map, holding the strong opinion that it was a new continent that [[Amerigo Vespucci]] had discovered on his voyage and not only a few smaller islands as [[Christopher Columbus]] did in the ''[[List of islands in the Caribbean|West Indies]]''.

{{Main|Piri Reis map}}
The '''Piri Reis map''' is a famous world map created by 16th-century [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turkish]] admiral and cartographer [[Piri Reis]]. The surviving third of the map shows part of the western coasts of Europe and North Africa with reasonable accuracy, and the coast of [[Brazil]] is also easily recognizable. Various Atlantic islands including the [[Azores]] and [[Canary Islands]] are depicted, as is the mythical island of [[Antillia]]. The map is noteworthy for its apparent south-eastward extension of the American continent to depict a southern landmass that some controversially claim is evidence for early awareness of the existence of [[Antarctica]]. Alternatively, it has been suggested that this is actually a record of the coast as far as [[Cape Horn]], explored secretly by Portuguese navigators before 1507 (when it appeared on the [[Waldseemüller map]]) and bent south-eastward simply to fit on the parchment.

[[Diogo Ribeiro]], a Portuguese cartographer working for Spain, made what is considered the first scientific world map: the 1527 [[Padrón real]],  the first world map based on empiric latitude observations. There are 6 copies attributed to Ribeiro, including at the [[Weimar]] Grand Ducal Library (1527 ''Mundus Novus'') and at the [[Biblioteca Apostolica Vaticana]], in [[Vatican City]] (1529 ''[[Propaganda]] Map'' or ''Carta Universal'').&lt;ref&gt;"Carta Universal" (slide description, Ribeiro bio), Henry-Davis.com, webpage: [http://www.henry-davis.com/MAPS/Ren/Ren1/346mono HDav346].&lt;/ref&gt; The layout of the map (''Mapamundi'') is strongly influenced by the information obtained during the Magellan-[[Juan Sebastián Elcano|Elcano]] trip around the world. Diogo's map delineates very precisely the coasts of [[Central America|Central]] and [[South America]]. However, neither [[Australia]] nor [[Antarctica]] appear, and the [[Indian subcontinent]] is too small. The map shows, for the first time, the real extension of the [[Pacific Ocean]]. It also shows, for the first time, the [[North America]]n coast as a continuous one (probably influenced by the [[Estêvão Gomes]] exploration in 1525). It also shows the demarcation of the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]].

[[Flemish people|Flemish]] geographer and cartographer [[Gerardus Mercator]] world map of 1569 introduced a [[Map projection#Cylindrical|cylindrical map projection]] that became the standard map projection known as the [[Mercator projection]]. It was a large planisphere measuring {{Convert|202 by 124|cm||abbr=on}}, printed in eighteen separate sheets. While the linear scale is constant in all directions around any point, thus preserving the angles and the shapes of small objects (which makes the projection [[conformal projection|conformal]]), the Mercator projection distorts the size and shape of large objects, as the scale increases from the Equator to the poles, where it becomes infinite. The title (''Nova et Aucta Orbis Terrae Descriptio ad Usum Navigatium Emendate'': "new and augmented description of Earth corrected for the use of navigation") and the [[Mercator 1569 world map#Summary of the legends|map legends]]   show that the map was expressly conceived for the use of marine navigation. The principal feature of the projection is that [[Rhumb line]]s, sailing courses at a constant bearing, are mapped to straight lines on the map. The development of the Mercator projection represented a major breakthrough in the nautical cartography of the 16th century although it was only slowly adopted by seafaring nations.

{{Main|Theatrum Orbis Terrarum}}
The ''Theatrum Orbis Terrarum'' (or  "Theatre of the World") is considered to be the first true modern [[atlas (cartography)|atlas]]. Written by [[Abraham Ortelius]] and originally printed on May 20, 1570, in [[Antwerp (city)|Antwerp]], it consisted of a collection of uniform [[map]] sheets and sustaining text bound to form a book for which copper printing plates were specifically engraved. The Ortelius atlas is sometimes referred to as the summary of sixteenth-century [[cartography]]. Many of his atlas' maps were based upon sources that no longer exist or are extremely rare. Ortelius appended a unique source list (the "Catalogus Auctorum") identifying the names of contemporary cartographers, some of whom would otherwise have remained obscure. Three [[Latin]] editions of this (besides a [[Dutch language|Dutch]], a [[French language|French]] and a [[German language|German]] edition) appeared before the end of 1572; twenty-five editions came out before Ortelius' death in 1598; and several others were published subsequently, for the atlas continued to be in demand until approximately 1612.

The '''Bünting Clover Leaf Map''', also known as '''The World in a Cloverleaf''', ([[German language|German]] title: "''Die ganze Welt in einem Kleberblat/Welches ist der Stadt Hannover meines lieben Vaterlandes Wapen''") is an historic [[mappa mundi]] drawn by the [[Germans|German]] [[Protestant]] [[pastor]], [[theologist]], and [[cartographer]] [[Heinrich Bünting]]. The map was published in his book ''Itinerarium Sacrae Scripturae'' (Travel through Holy Scripture) in 1581. 

Today the map is found within the Eran Laor maps collection in the [[National Library of Israel]] in [[Jerusalem]]. A mosaic model of the map is installed on the fence of [[Safra Square]] at the site of Jerusalem's city hall.

The map is a figurative illustration, in the manner of the medieval mappa mundi format, depicting the world via a [[clover]] shape.&lt;ref name="Carlton2015"&gt;{{cite book|author=Genevieve Carlton|title=Worldly Consumers: The Demand for Maps in Renaissance Italy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6MCkCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA42|year=2015|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-25545-3|page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; The shape is a symbolisation of the [[Christian]] [[Trinity]] and a component at the symbolisation of the German city [[Hanover]], where Bünting was born. The city of Jerusalem is represented as the centre, surrounded by three central continents, with some more areas of the world being accordingly illustrated separately from the clover.

The map is in [[Classical Chinese]], with detailed annotations and descriptions of various regions of the world, a brief account of the discovery of the Americas, [[Polar projection|polar projections]], scientific explanation of parallels and meridians, and proof that the sun is bigger than the moon. Following Chinese cartographical convention, Ricci placed China ("the Middle Kingdom") at the centre of the world. This map is a significant mark of the expansion Chinese knowledge of the world, and an important example of [[cultural syncretism]] directly between Europe and China. It was also exported to [[Korea]] and [[Japan]] as well. &lt;ref name="Rothstein"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/20/arts/design/20map.html?pagewanted=1|title=Map That Shrank the World|last=Rothstein|first=Edward |date=2010-01-19|work=New York Times, Arts, EXHIBITION REVIEW |publisher=New York Times Company|accessdate=20 January 2010|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Nova Totius Terrarum Orbis Geographica ac Hydrographica Tabula'' is a map of the world created by [[Henricus Hondius II|Hendrik Hondius]] in 1630, and published the following year at [[Amsterdam]], in the atlas ''Atlantis Maioris'' Appendix. Illustrations of the four elements of fire, air, water, and land are included. In the four corners, there are portraits of [[Julius Caesar]], [[Claudius Ptolemy]], and the atlas's first two publishers, [[Gerard Mercator]] and [[Jodocus Hondius]], the father of Hendrik.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nova totius terrarum orbis geographica ac hydrographica tabula|url=http://maps.bpl.org/id/m8709|publisher=[[Norman B.

An '''equatorial bulge''' is a difference between the [[equator]]ial and polar [[diameter]]s of a [[planet]], due to the [[centrifugal force]] exerted by the [[rotation]] about the body's axis. A rotating body tends to form an [[oblate spheroid]] rather than a [[sphere]]. The [[Earth]] has an equatorial bulge of {{cvt|42.77|km|mi}}; that is, its diameter measured across the equatorial plane ({{cvt|12756.274|km|mi}}) is 42.77&amp;nbsp;km more than that measured between the poles ({{cvt|12713.56|km|mi}}). An observer standing at [[sea level]] on either [[geographical pole|pole]], therefore, is 21.36&amp;nbsp;km closer to Earth's central point than if standing at sea level on the Equator. The value of Earth's radius may be approximated by the average of these radii.

As a result of Earth's equatorial bulge, the highest point on Earth, measured from the center and outwards, is the peak of Mount [[Chimborazo (volcano)|Chimborazo]] in [[Ecuador]] rather than [[Mount Everest]]. But since the ocean also bulges, like Earth and [[atmosphere of Earth|its atmosphere]], Chimborazo is not as high above sea level as Everest is.

The standard formula for this force is the relationship &lt;math&gt;F_c =  Mv^2 / R&lt;/math&gt;. However, [[velocity]] at the surface is equal to the product of radius and rotational velocity, and therefore the force is directly proportional to radius. Viewing the globe as a series of rotating discs, the radius ''R'' toward the poles decreases and thus a smaller force is produced for the same rotational velocity (approaching zero at the pole). Moving towards the Equator, ''v^2'' increases much faster than ''R'', thus producing the greatest force at the Equator.

In addition, because Earth's [[inner core|dense core]] is included in the [[Cross section (geometry)|cross-section]]al disc at the Equator, it contributes more to the mass of the disc. Similarly, there is a bulge in the water envelope of the oceans surrounding Earth; this bulge is created by the greater [[centrifugal force]] at the Equator and is independent from [[tide]]s. Sea level at the Equator is 21.36&amp;nbsp;km higher than that at either pole, in terms of distance from the center of the planet.

== The equilibrium as a balance of energies ==

[[Image:Equatorial bulge model.png|frame|right|Fixed to the vertical rod is a spring metal band. When stationary the spring metal band is circular in shape. The top of the metal band can slide along the vertical rod.

When spun, the spring-metal band bulges at its equator and flattens at its poles in analogy with the Earth.]]

[[Gravity]] tends to contract a celestial body into a [[sphere]], the shape for which all the mass is as close to the center of gravity as possible.  [[Rotation]] causes a distortion from this spherical shape; a common measure of the distortion is the [[flattening]] (sometimes called ellipticity or oblateness), which can depend on a variety of factors including the size, [[angular velocity]], [[density]], and [[Elasticity (physics)|elasticity]].

To get a feel for the type of equilibrium that is involved, imagine someone seated in a spinning swivel chair, with weights in their hands. If the person in the chair pulls the weights towards them, they are doing work and their rotational kinetic energy increases. The increase of rotation rate is so strong that at the faster rotation rate the required [[centripetal force]] is larger than with the starting rotation rate.

Something analogous to this occurs in planet formation. Matter first coalesces into a slowly rotating disk-shaped distribution, and collisions and friction convert kinetic energy to heat, which allows the disk to self-gravitate into a very oblate spheroid.

As long as the proto-planet is still too oblate to be in equilibrium, the release of gravitational potential energy on contraction keeps driving the increase in rotational kinetic energy. As the contraction proceeds the rotation rate keeps going up, hence the required force for further contraction keeps going up. There is a point where the increase of rotational kinetic energy on further contraction would be larger than the release of gravitational potential energy. The contraction process can only proceed up to that point, so it halts there.

As long as there is no equilibrium there can be violent convection, and as long as there is violent convection friction can convert kinetic energy to heat, draining rotational kinetic energy from the system. When the equilibrium state has been reached then large scale conversion of kinetic energy to heat ceases. In that sense the equilibrium state is the lowest state of energy that can be reached.

The Earth's rotation rate is still slowing down, though gradually, by about two thousandths of a second per rotation every 100 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hadhazy|first=Adam|title=Fact or Fiction: The Days (and Nights) Are Getting Longer|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=earth-rotation-summer-solstice|publisher=[[Scientific American]]|accessdate=5 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Estimates of how fast the Earth was rotating in the past vary, because it is not known exactly how the moon was formed. Estimates of the Earth's rotation 500 million years ago are around 20 modern hours per "day".

The Earth's rate of rotation is slowing down mainly because of tidal interactions with the Moon and the Sun. Since the solid parts of the Earth are [[ductile]], the Earth's equatorial bulge has been decreasing in step with the decrease in the rate of rotation.

== Differences in gravitational acceleration ==

[[Image:Forces oblate spheroid2.gif|frame|right|The forces at play in the case of a planet with an equatorial bulge due to rotation.&lt;br/&gt;
Red arrow: gravity &lt;br&gt;
Green arrow, the [[normal force]] &lt;br/&gt;
Blue arrow: the resultant force &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The resultant force provides required centripetal force. Without this centripetal force frictionless objects would slide towards the equator. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
In calculations, when a coordinate system is used that is co-rotating with the Earth, the vector of the notional [[centrifugal force (rotating reference frame)|centrifugal force]] points outward, and is just as large as the vector representing the centripetal force.]]

Because of a planet's rotation around its own axis, the gravitational acceleration is less at the equator than at the poles. In the 17th century, following the invention of the [[pendulum clock]], French scientists found that clocks sent to [[French Guiana]], on the northern coast of [[South America]], ran slower than their exact counterparts in Paris. Measurements of the acceleration due to gravity at the equator must also take into account the planet's rotation. Any object that is stationary with respect to the surface of the Earth is actually following a circular trajectory, circumnavigating the Earth's axis. Pulling an object into such a circular trajectory requires a force. The acceleration that is required to circumnavigate the Earth's axis along the equator at one revolution per [[sidereal day]] is 0.0339&amp;nbsp;m/s². Providing this acceleration decreases the effective gravitational acceleration. At the equator, the effective gravitational acceleration is 9.7805&amp;nbsp;m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. This means that the true gravitational acceleration at the equator must be 9.8144&amp;nbsp;m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (9.7805&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;0.0339&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;9.8144).

At the poles, the gravitational acceleration is 9.8322&amp;nbsp;m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The difference of 0.0178&amp;nbsp;m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; between the gravitational acceleration at the poles and the true gravitational acceleration at the equator is because objects located on the equator are about 21 kilometers further away from the center of mass of the Earth than at the poles, which corresponds to a smaller gravitational acceleration.

In summary, there are two contributions to the fact that the effective gravitational acceleration is less strong at the equator than at the poles. About 70 percent of the difference is contributed by the fact that objects circumnavigate the Earth's axis, and about 30 percent is due to the non-spherical shape of the Earth.

The diagram illustrates that on all latitudes the effective gravitational acceleration is decreased by the requirement of providing a centripetal force; the decreasing effect is strongest on the equator.

== Satellite orbits ==
The fact that the Earth's gravitational field slightly deviates from being spherically symmetrical also affects the orbits of [[satellite]]s through secular orbital precessions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

== Other celestial bodies ==
Generally any celestial body that is rotating (and that is sufficiently massive to draw itself into spherical or near spherical shape) will have an equatorial bulge matching its rotation rate. [[Saturn]] is the planet with the largest equatorial bulge in Earth's Solar System (11808&amp;nbsp;km, 7337 miles).

The following is a table of the equatorial bulge of some major celestial bodies of the Solar System:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Body
!Equatorial diameter !! Polar diameter !! Equatorial bulge !! [[Flattening]] ratio
|-
| [[Earth]] || 12,756.27&amp;nbsp;km || 12,713.56&amp;nbsp;km ||  42.77&amp;nbsp;km || 1:298.2575
|-
| [[Mars]] || 6,805&amp;nbsp;km || 6,754.8&amp;nbsp;km || 50.2&amp;nbsp;km || 1:135.56
|-

|}

Equatorial bulges should not be confused with [[equatorial ridge|equatorial ridges]]. Equatorial ridges are a feature of at least three of Saturn's moons: the large moon [[Iapetus (moon)|Iapetus]] and the tiny moons [[Atlas (moon)|Atlas]], [[Pan (moon)|Pan]], and [[Daphnis (moon)|Daphnis]]. These ridges closely follow the moons' equators. The ridges appear to be unique to the Saturnian system, but it is uncertain whether the occurrences are related or a coincidence. The first three were discovered by the [[Cassini-Huygens|Cassini probe]] in 2005; the Daphnean ridge was discovered in 2017. The ridge on Iapetus is nearly 20&amp;nbsp;km wide, 13&amp;nbsp;km high and 1,300&amp;nbsp;km long. The ridge on Atlas is proportionally even more remarkable given the moon's much smaller size, giving it a disk-like shape. Images of Pan show a structure similar to that of Atlas, while the one on Daphnis is less pronounced.

== Mathematical expression ==
The flattening coefficient &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; for the equilibrium configuration of a self-gravitating spheroid, composed of uniform density incompressible fluid, rotating steadily about some fixed axis, for a small amount of flattening, is approximated by:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://farside.ph.utexas.edu/teaching/336k/Newton/node109.html|title=Rotational Flattening|work=utexas.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;f = \frac{a_e-a_p}{a} = {5 \over 4} {\omega^2 a^3 \over G M} = {15 \pi \over 4} {1 \over G T^2 \rho}   &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;a_e = a\bigg(1+{ f \over 3} \bigg)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;a_p = a\bigg(1-{ 2f\over 3}\bigg)&lt;/math&gt; are respectively the equatorial and polar radius,
&lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is the mean radius,
&lt;math&gt;\omega = {2 \pi \over T}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[angular velocity]],
&lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is the rotation period,
&lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is the universal [[gravitational constant]],
&lt;math&gt;M \simeq {4 \over 3} \pi \rho a^3&lt;/math&gt; is the total body mass,
and &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is the body density.

[[Luxembourg]] is a small country located in the [[Low Countries]], part of [[North-West Europe]]  It borders [[Belgium]] for {{convert|148|km|abbr=off}} to the west and north, [[France]] ({{convert|23|km|abbr=on|disp=sqbr}}) to the south, and [[Germany]] ({{convert|138|km|abbr=on|disp=sqbr}}) to the east.  Luxembourg is landlocked, separated from the [[North Sea]] by Belgium.

The topography of the country is divided very clearly between the hilly [[Oesling]] of the northern third of the Grand Duchy and the flat [[Gutland (Luxembourg)|Gutland]], which occupies the southern two-thirds.  The country's longest river is the [[Sauer]], which is a tributary of the [[Moselle (river)|Moselle]], the basin of which includes almost all of Luxembourg's area.  Other major rivers include the [[Alzette]] in the south and the [[Wiltz River|Wiltz]] in the north.

The [[Capital (political)|capital]], and by far the largest city, is [[Luxembourg City]], which is located in the Gutland, as are most of the country's main population centres, including [[Esch-sur-Alzette]], [[Dudelange]], and [[Differdange]].  Besides Luxembourg City, the other main towns are primarily located in the southern [[Red Lands]] region, which lines the border between Luxembourg and France to the south.

==Physical geography==
===Topography===
[[Image:lux topo en.jpg|thumb|250px|A map of Luxembourg's relief clearly illustrates the dichotomy between the hilly [[Oesling]] in the north and the southern [[Gutland (Luxembourg)|Gutland]].]]
Despite its small size, Luxembourg has a varied topography, with two main features to its landscape. The northern section of the country is formed by part of the plateau of the [[Ardennes]], where the mountain heights range from {{convert|450|to|600|m|ft|abbr=off|sigfig=2}}. The rest of the country is made up of undulating countryside with broad valleys. The capital, [[Luxembourg City]], is located in the southern part of the country.

===Green heart of Europe===
The most prominent landmark, the high plateau of the Ardennes in the north. At its highest point, it reaches a height of {{convert|559|m|ft|abbr=on}}. Commonly known as the Oesling, the Ardennes region covers {{convert|325|sqmi|km2|order=flip|abbr=off}}, about 32% of the entire country. Rugged scenery predominates because [[river erosion]] over thousands of years has left a varied, low mountain landscape, densely covered with vegetation, sometimes with considerable variations in height. These differences in relief, together with stretches of water interspersed with forests, fields, and pastures are the main features that make the landscape so distinctive. Typical of this high area, however, is the infertile soil and poor drainage resulting in numerous [[peat bogs]], which were once exploited as fuel. These factors, combined with heavy rainfall and frost, made this an inhospitable environment for the first settlers.

Even today, the living conditions in such an environment are not particularly favourable. Nevertheless, some 7,800 people make a living of the land through either forestry, small-scale farming, or environment work. Because the soil is so difficult to cultivate, most of the land is used for cattle pasture. The Ardennes region also includes the [[Upper Sûre National Park]], an important conservation area and a hiker's retreat.

South of the [[Sauer|Sûre River]], the country is known as the [[Gutland (Luxembourg)|Gutland]]. The region covers slightly over two-thirds of the country.

The terrain gently rises and falls with an average height of {{convert|200|m|ft|abbr=on|sigfig=1}}. Agriculture is the main activity as term Gutland arises from the fertile soil and warm, dry summers experienced is this part of the Duchy compared to the Oesling region.

As a result, vegetables and fruit, such as [[strawberry|strawberries]], [[apple]]s, [[plum]]s, and [[cherry|cherries]], are grown in large quantities. River erosion in this area has created deep gorges and caves, resulting in some spectacular scenery.

In the extreme south of the country lies "the land of the red rocks" – a reference to the deposits of minerals found here. Rich in [[iron ore]], the district has been a mining and heavy industrial region since Roman if not earlier times and stretches for over {{convert|12|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}}. The tall chimneys of the iron and steel works are typical landmarks of the industrial south. To the east lies the [[grape]]-growing valley of the [[Moselle (river)|Moselle]]. Numerous villages nestle in the deep valleys and behind the vineyards along the river banks. Most villages have at least one winery. Also in the east is the "[[Little Switzerland (Luxembourg)|Little Switzerland]]" area, characterized by wooded glens and ravines in unusual rock formations.

===Rivers and lakes===
Luxembourg has a number of minor rivers, such as the [[Eisch]], the [[Alzette]], and the [[Pétrusse]], but the main river is the Moselle with its tributaries-the Sûre and the [[Our River|Our]]. Together, their courses serve as a natural boundary between Luxembourg and [[Germany]]. Along their banks, many of the country's medieval castles can be found.

The [[Moselle (river)|Moselle]] actually rises in northeast [[France]] and flows north through Luxembourg for {{convert|19|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} to join the mighty [[Rhine]] at [[Koblenz]], [[Germany]]. The Moselle is {{convert|320|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} long, and is navigable, due to canalization for {{convert|40|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}}. Green slopes, covered with vines, flank the meandering course of the river.

Rising in Belgium, the Sûre River flows for {{convert|107|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} in an easterly direction through Luxembourg and into the Moselle. Its sinuous course essentially cuts Luxembourg from east to west. The Our River, flowing along the northeastern border, is a tributary of the Sûre. Its valley is surrounded by unspoiled countryside.

The [[Upper Sûre Lake|Upper Sûre lake]] is the largest stretch of water in the Grand Duchy. Surrounded by luxuriant vegetation and peaceful creeks, the lake is a centre for water sports, such as sailing, canoeing, and kayaking. Such outdoor activities, which has made it an attractive spot for tourists, have led to the growth of a local crafts industry.

The town of [[Esch-sur-Sûre]] nestles at one end of the lake. Immediately above it, the river has been dammed to form a hydroelectric reservoir extending some {{convert|6|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on|0}} up the valley. The Upper Sûre dam was built in the 1960s to meet the country's drinking water requirements.

==Environment==
===Climate===
[[Image:Luxembourg City climate.PNG|right|thumb|250px]]
Luxembourg is part of the [[West European Continental]] climatic region, and enjoys a temperate climate without extremes. Winters are mild, summers fairly cool, and rainfall is high.

Seasonal weather is somewhat different between the northern and southern regions. In the north there is considerable influence from the Atlantic systems, in which the passage of frequent pressure depressions gives rise to unstable weather conditions. This results in overcast skies and considerable drizzle in the winter.

Rainfall reaches {{convert|1200|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} a year in some areas. In the summer, excessive heat is rare and temperatures drop noticeably at night. Low temperatures and humidity make for what those living in this part of the country call, optimistically, an "invigorating climate".

In the south, although the rainfall is not significantly low, at around {{convert|800|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}, and the winters no milder, the principal difference is in the higher summer temperatures, especially in the [[Moselle Valley]]. Crops, especially wine grapes, thrive here. With a mean annual temperature of {{convert|10|°C|°F}}, the sunniest months are May to August. In the spring, the countryside is a riot of wildflowers and blossoms.

===Flora and fauna===
Luxembourg's flora is characterized by the country's location at the border between the [[Atlantic-European]] and [[Central-European]] climate zones. In the north, [[European beech|beech]] and [[pedunculate oak|oak]] trees are plentiful. The oak trees can grow up to {{convert|30|–|45|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, with a diameter of {{convert|1.2|–|2.4|m|ft|1|abbr=on}}. They supply large quantities of excellent hardwood timber because of their strength.

Along the riverbanks, species like the [[Alnus glutinosa|black alder]] and [[willow]]s can be found. Alder wood is pale yellow to reddish brown, fine-textured and durable even under water. It is also an important timber tree mainly because of its disease-resistant properties. Willow trees can reach a height of {{convert|20|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, and are valued for ornamental purposes.

The narrow, deeply incised valleys of the north also provide a habitat for rare plants and animals, especially the [[European otter]], a protected species. In the industrial south, among the abandoned quarries and deserted open pit mines, nature has reclaimed her own, and there are flowers everywhere.

The City of [[Stockholm]] is situated on fourteen islands and on the banks to the archipelago where [[Mälaren|Lake Mälaren]] meets the [[Baltic Sea]]. The city centre is virtually situated on the water.

The access to fresh water is excellent in Stockholm today, in contrast to the historically horrible state of things, when lakes and watercourses were used as [[refuse dump]]s and [[latrine]]s, causing epidemic [[cholera]] and many other diseases. By the 1860s things changed, as water fetched from [[Årstaviken]], the waters south of [[Södermalm]], was treated in the first [[Water purification|water-purifying plant]] at [[Skanstull]] and from there distributed through [[water main]]s.&lt;ref name="water-750-years" /&gt;

In modern times the city gets its water from [[Mälaren|Lake Mälaren]] purified by plants at [[Norsborg]] and [[Lovön]], together producing 350,000 m³ per day, which means Stockholmers are consuming 200 litres per day on average. Water is purified at three plants at [[Bromma]], [[Henriksdal]] and [[Loudden]], together filtering some 400,000 m³ sewage per day from pollution, including [[nitrogen]] and [[phosphorus]], before discharging it into the [[Baltic Sea]].&lt;ref name="water-750-years" /&gt;

Levels of several pollutants in lakes in the central parts of the city, especially on the western side, are far above average, including substances such as [[cadmium]], [[copper]], [[mercury (element)|mercury]], and [[lead]].  Decreasing usage of several of these substances has reduced these levels in the upper sediments of the lakes.&lt;ref name="water-750-years" /&gt;

The Stockholm area used to contain a lot more lakes and watercourses than it does today, much due to [[post-glacial rebound]], but also because of lake reclaims for settlements and health. Historical lakes, such as [[Fatburssjön]] on [[Södermalm]] and [[Träsket]] on [[Norrmalm]], were filthy, stinking, and associated with the high mortality in Stockholm until the late 19th century. Other historical lakes, like [[Packartorgsviken]] and its interior part [[Katthavet]], were filled with mud and equally stinky. Other lakes still present today were once much larger – such as [[Magelungen]], [[Drevviken]], [[Judarn]], and [[Råstasjön]] – while some bays of today once were proper lakes – [[Brunnsviken]] and [[Hammarby sjö]].&lt;ref name="vattenprogram"&gt;''Vattenprogram för Stockholm 2000''&lt;/ref&gt;

Like in many other urban areas, the lakes of Stockholm are directly affected by the city's sewer system and pollution from settlements, traffic, and industry. Sewers often reduce the catchment areas of smaller lakes by redirecting surface water to [[Mälaren|Lake Mälaren]] or [[Saltsjön|Lake Saltsjön]]. While nutritious substances such as [[phosphorus]] and [[nitrogen]] are mostly derived from agriculture, urban areas produce high amounts of [[metal]]s and [[organic compound]]s. In Stockholm, this mostly applies to central bays – such as [[Klara sjö]], [[Årstaviken]], [[Ulvsundasjön]], [[Riddarfjärden]], and [[Hammarby Sjö]] - but also waters surrounded by bungalows and villas – like [[Långsjön, Älvsjö|Långsjön]] in [[Älvsjö]].&lt;ref name="vattenprogram" /&gt;

== Bridges and viaducts ==
[[Image:Stallbron.jpg|thumb|Stallbron is located where the first bridge in Stockholm was found.]]

The historical name for [[Gamla stan|Stockholm Old Town]] was "The city between the bridges" (''Staden mellan broarna''), a name which is still used for the entire city which spans over numerous islands, islets, and hills. During the course of centuries, the city has seen many bridges relieve each other.

In an [[urban code]] dated 1350, King [[Magnus IV of Sweden|Magnus IV]] (1316-1377) prescribed the bridges leading over [[Norrström]] and [[Söderström (Stockholm)|Söderström]] to be built and maintained by the city of Stockholm together with six other cities surrounding [[Mälaren|Lake Mälaren]], as they were the only land passage between the provinces [[Uppland]] and [[Södermanland]], north and south of the city respectively. Apparently, in the view of the king, the city, a hundred years after its foundation, still couldn't afford to maintain its own bridges.&lt;ref name="Dufwa-intro"&gt;Dufwa, pp 182-184&lt;/ref&gt;

Still, these first bridges were in no sense technically complicated or physically impressive, but rather simple wooden bridges, either [[pontoon bridge|floating bridge]]s or [[beam bridge]]s resting on poles or stone [[Caisson (engineering)|caisson]]s, in either case with spans of no more than a few metres. The width probably corresponded to the directions for public roads, eight [[ell]] or 4,8 metres, which was probably more than enough for many centuries. The long and narrow bridges were easily demolished in case of siege, which besides the [[drawbridge]]s, also necessary for the passing of ships, was an important defensive strategy. As the accounts of the city tells, [[spring flood]]s and [[ice break-up]]s resulted in the frequent destruction of the bridges.&lt;ref name="Dufwa-intro" /&gt;

By the mid 17th century, the population of the city had resulted in settlements north and south of [[Gamla stan]], on [[Norrmalm]] and [[Södermalm]], and the number of bridges had grown considerably, if not their dimensions or quality. In a map dated 1640, three bridges connects [[Stadsholmen]] to Norrmalm passing over [[Helgeandsholmen]], at the time still a group of islets; while two bridges close to each other lead over to [[Riddarholmen]]. Several new bridges of considerable length connected Norrmalm to the islets west and east of it; [[Blasieholmen]], at the time still an islet, was connected to the mainland by a bridge called [[Näckenströms bro]], and northward to present day [[Strandvägen]] by [[Stora Ladugårdslandsbron]], a {{convert|190|m|ft|adj=mid|-long}} bridge on poles; and to the west a bridge connected Norrmalm to [[Kungsholmen]] over [[Blekholmen]], a now non-existent islet. By the end of the 17th century, population growth resulted in an additional bridge north of Stadsholmen.&lt;ref name="Dufwa-intro" /&gt;

One of the oldest bridges was located where today [[Stallbron]] is found, immediately south of the [[Riksdag Building]]. The first stone bridge, [[Norrbro]], was built in front of the [[Stockholm Palace|Royal Palace]] under [[Gustav III of Sweden|Gustav III]].&lt;ref name="Dufwa-Norrbro-Stallbron"&gt;Dufwa, p 184&lt;/ref&gt;

Not until the 20th century, Stockholm was able to surpass the straits and bays surrounding the city. Half of the about 30 bridges in central Stockholm were built 1920&amp;ndash;50, most of them during the 1930s. This development was due to increasing traffic loads caused by a fivefold increase of vehicles in the 1920s. At [[Slussen]], passing ships caused stationary rows of trams several hundreds metres long. The situation was solved when a traffic committee in 1930 could present the so-called "clover-leaf solution" of engineer [[Gösta Lundborg]] and architect [[Tage William-Olsson]] inaugurated in 1935. The modernity of the solution put Stockholm in a state of rapture and impressed even [[Le Corbusier]], who praised the scale of the construction and invited the world to follow the example of Stockholm.&lt;ref name="Andersson-149-151"&gt;Andersson, ''Stockholms årsringar'', "De stora broarna - Sprången över vattenrummet", pp 149-151&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, across the [[Riddarfjärden]] bay, construction works had started on [[Västerbron]], the large bridge offering a north–south passage west of the historical city centre. Designed by architects [[David Dahl (architect)|David Dahl]] and [[Paul Hedqvist]] and engineered by Ernst Nilsson and [[Salomon Kasarnowski]], Västerbron became the first large bridge designed by this quartet. [[Tranebergsbron]] was inaugurated in 1934, with its span of 200 m, for a few years the world's longest span. These large-scale bridges not only tied various parts of the city together, but their mere size changed the cityscape permanently. Considerably smaller but during the decade equally praised was the small [[Riksbron]] designed by [[Ragnar Östberg]].&lt;ref name="Andersson-149-151" /&gt;

{{See also|List of bridges in Stockholm}}

== National parks and nature reserves ==
The [[nature reserve]]s in Stockholm involves regulations affecting both landowners and the general public by regulating usage of [[insecticide]]s and [[fertilizer]]s, construction of bridges, lighting of fires, camping, anchoring, and keeping unleashed dogs. A plan for the care and development of a nature reserve often means the city as well as private landowners are obliged to guarantee the maintenance of the area.&lt;ref name="vattenprogram" /&gt;

There is one [[national urban park]], [[Kungliga Nationalstadsparken]], and three major nature reserves in Stockholm, [[Kyrksjölöten]], [[Judarskogen]] and [[Grimstaskogen]] while [[Hansta]] is likely to become one soon. Transforming the other areas listed below into nature reserves is being investigated, as they all are regarded to be of great recreational and biological value.&lt;ref name="vattenprogram" /&gt;
* [[Judarskogen]]
* [[Kyrksjölöten]]
* [[Hansta]]
* [[Järvafältet]]

== Divisions ==
The city is divided into 18 boroughs as regulated by the [[Politics of Stockholm|City Council]]. In looser terms, the city is also divided into three major parts:
*[[Stockholm City Centre]] (''Innerstaden'')
*[[South Stockholm]] (''Söderort'')
*[[West Stockholm]] (''Västerort'')

Surrounding the city is the [[Metropolitan Stockholm|Stockholm Metropolitan Area]].

The terrain of [[Chad]] in central [[Africa]] is dominated by the low-lying [[Chad Basin]] (elevation about 250 m / 820 ft), which rises gradually to mountains and plateaus on the north, east, and south. In the [[east]] heights of more than 900 metres (3,000 ft) are attained in the [[Ennedi]] and [[Ouaddaï highlands|Ouaddaï]] plateaus. The greatest [[elevation]]s are reached in the [[Tibesti]] massif in the north, with a maximum height of 3,415 metres (11,204 ft) at Emi [[Koussi]]. The northern half of the republic lies in the [[Sahara]].

==Geology==
The geology of Chad includes an area of [[metamorphic]] rocks of [[Precambrian]] age surrounding the [[Lake Chad|Chad Basin]] which is floored with [[Tertiary]] and [[Quaternary]] [[sediment]]s. There are Precambrian rocks in the [[Tibesti]] Mountains in the north and the east whilst in eastern Chad are basement rocks, some of which extend into [[Darfur]] in neighbouring [[Sudan]]. 

[[granite|Granitic]] [[gneiss]] and [[pelite|pelitic]]-[[graphite|graphitic]] [[schist]]s are widespread. These are commonly cut by late orogenic granites and [[pegmatite]]s. Within the [[Kufra Basin]] in the northeast are lower [[Palaeozoic]] sandstones which are overlain by [[Nubian Sandstone]]s. There are also continental [[clastic]] rocks of lower [[Cretaceous]] age and rocks of marine origin from the Upper Cretaceous.

Within the Chad Basin, the Neogene [[Chad Formation]] is composed of [[lake|lacustrine]] sediments.&lt;ref name=EIS/&gt;

The '''Global Environment Facility (GEF)''' was established on the eve of the 1992 Rio Earth Summit to help tackle our planet’s most pressing environmental problems.  The GEF unites 183 countries in partnership with international institutions, civil society organizations (CSOs), and the private sector to address global environmental issues while supporting national sustainable development initiatives. Since 1992, the GEF has provided over $17 billion in grants and mobilized an additional $88 billion in financing for more than 4000 projects in 170 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thegef.org/about-us|title=About the GEF|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through its [http://www.sgp.undp.org/ Small Grants Programme (SGP)], the GEF has invested $450million and leveraged similar levels of co financing supporting over 14,500 community based projects in over 125 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sgp.undp.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=98&amp;Itemid=223#.WfCqAa2ZO3I|title=About the GEF SGP|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An independently operating financial organization, the GEF provides grants for projects related to [[biodiversity]], [[climate change]], [[international waters]], [[land degradation]], the [[ozone layer]], [[Persistent organic pollutant|persistent organic pollutants (POPs)]], [[Mercury poisoning|mercury]], [[sustainable forest management]], [[food security]], [[Sustainable city|sustainable cities]].

The GEF also serves as financial mechanism for the following conventions:
* [http://www.cbd.int/ CBD] [[Convention on Biological Diversity]] 
* [http://www.unfccc.int/ United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)]
* [http://www.unccd.int/ UN Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD)]
* [http://chm.pops.int/ Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs)]
* [http://www.mercuryconvention.org/ Minamata Convention on Mercury]
The GEF, although not linked formally to the [[Montreal Protocol]] on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer (MP), supports implementation of the Protocol in countries with economies in transition.

The [https://www.thegef.org/publications/instrument-establishment-restructured-global-environment-facility Instrument for the Establishment of the Restructured GEF] is the document that established the GEF after an initial pilot phase. It was accepted by the member countries and adopted by the Implementing Agencies in 1994. The Instrument may be considered the statutes and by-laws of the GEF, and contains provisions for the governance, participation, replenishment, and fiduciary and administrative operations of the GEF. It also lays out the roles and responsibilities of different actors in the GEF.

== Structure ==

The GEF has a unique governing structure organized around an Assembly, the Council, the Secretariat, 18 Agencies, a Scientific and Technical Advisory Panel (STAP) and the Evaluation Office.
* The '''[https://www.thegef.org/about/organization#slide-1 GEF Assembly]''' is composed of all 183 member countries,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thegef.org/partners/countries-participants|title=GEF participant countries|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; or Participants. It meets every three to four years at the ministerial level to review general policies; review and evaluate the GEF’s operation based on reports submitted to Council; review the membership of the Facility; and consider, for approval by consensus, amendments to the  ''[https://www.thegef.org/publications/instrument-establishment-restructured-global-environment-facility Instrument for the Establishment of the Restructured GEF] on the basis of recommendations by the Council.'' Ministers and high-level government delegations of all GEF member countries take part in the meetings. The Assembly combines plenary meetings and high-level panels, exhibits, side events and GEF project site visits. Prominent environmentalists, parliamentarians, business leaders, scientists, and NGO leaders discuss global environmental challenges within the context of sustainable development and other international development goals.
* The '''[https://www.thegef.org/about/organization#slide-2 GEF Council]''' is the main governing body of the GEF. It comprises 32 members appointed by constituencies of GEF member countries (14 from developed countries, 16 from developing countries and 2 from economies in transition). Council Members - '''[https://www.thegef.org/constituencies-council-members-and-alternates List of Council Members and Alternates]''' - rotate every three years or until the constituency appoints a new Member. The Council, which meets twice annually, develops, adopts and evaluates the operational policies and programs for GEF-financed activities. It also reviews and approves the work program (projects submitted for approval), making decisions by consensus.

* The '''[https://www.thegef.org/about/organization#slide-7 GEF Secretariat]''' is based in Washington, D.C. and reports directly to the GEF Council and Assembly, ensuring that their decisions are translated into effective actions. The secretariat coordinates the formulation of projects included in the work programs, oversees its implementation, and makes certain that operational strategy and policies are followed. The '''[https://www.thegef.org/about/ceo-chairperson GEF CEO and Chairperson, Dr. Naoko Ishii]''' heads the Secretariat.
* The GEF '''[https://www.thegef.org/about/organization#slide-4 Scientific and Technical Advisory Panel (STAP)]''' provides the GEF with scientific and technical advice on policies, operational strategies, programs and projects. The Panel consists of six members, who are internationally recognized experts in the GEF’s key areas of work. They are supported by a global network of experts and institutions. In addition, the STAP interacts with other relevant scientific and technical bodies, particularly with the subsidiary bodies of the environmental conventions.
* An independent '''[https://www.thegef.org/about/organization#slide-6 GEF Evaluation Office]''' reports directly to the Council. It is headed by a Director, appointed by the Council, who coordinates a team of specialized evaluators. It works with the Secretariat and the GEF Agencies to share lessons learned and best practices. The Office undertakes independent evaluations of GEF impact and effectiveness. These are typically on focal areas, institutional issues or cross-cutting themes.
* '''[https://www.thegef.org/about/organization#slide-8 GEF Agencies]''' are the operational arm of the GEF. They work closely with project proponents — government agencies, civil society organizations and other stakeholders — to design, develop and implement GEF-funded projects and programs. The GEF works with18 agencies.

==History==

The Global Environment Facility was established in October 1991 as a $1 billion pilot program in the World Bank to assist in the protection of the global environment and to promote environmental sustainable development. The GEF would provide new and additional grants and concessional funding to cover the "incremental" or additional costs associated with transforming a project with national benefits into one with global environmental benefits.
 
The United Nations Development Programme, the United Nations Environment Program, and the World Bank were the three initial partners implementing GEF projects.

In 1992, at the [[Rio Earth Summit]], the GEF was restructured and moved out of the World Bank system to become a permanent, separate institution. The decision to make the GEF an independent organization enhanced the involvement of developing countries in the decision-making process and in implementation of the projects. Since 1994, however, the World Bank has served as the Trustee of the GEF Trust Fund and provided administrative services.
 
As part of the restructuring, the GEF was entrusted to become the financial mechanism for both the UN Convention on Biological Diversity and the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. In partnership with the Montreal Protocol of the Vienna Convention on Ozone Layer Depleting Substances, the GEF started funding projects that enable the Russian Federation and nations in Eastern Europe and Central Asia to phase out their use of ozone-destroying chemicals.

In 1998, the GEF Council decided to expand beyond the initial three Implementing Agencies, including to the International Finance Corporation, to broaden its ability to enable innovating financing mechanisms and better leverage private sector investment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EXPANDED OPPORTUNITIES FOR EXECUTING AGENCIES|url=https://www.thegef.org/sites/default/files/council-meeting-documents/GEF.C.12.10_5.pdf|website=Global Environment Facility|accessdate=29 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The GEF subsequently was also selected to serve as financial mechanism for three more international conventions: The Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants (2001), the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (2003), and the Minamata Convention on Mercury (2013).

== Areas of work ==
The GEF work focuses on seven main areas, including biodiversity, climate change (mitigation and adaptation), chemicals, international waters, land degradation, sustainable forest management/REDD+,Ozone layer depletion.

'''[[Biodiversity]]''': Biodiversity is under heavy threat. Reducing and preventing further [[biodiversity loss]] are considered among the most critical challenges to humankind. Of all the problems the world faces in managing “global goods,” only the loss of biodiversity is irreversible. The GEF supports projects that address the key drivers of biodiversity loss which focus on the highest leveraging opportunities to achieve sustainable biodiversity conservation.

'''[[Climate change]]''': Climate change from human-induced emissions of heat-trapping [[greenhouse gas]]es (GHGs) is a critical global issue, requiring substantial action. These actions include investment to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, and adaptation to climate changes including variability. The early impacts of climate change have already appeared, and scientists believe that further impacts are inevitable. Many of the most serious and negative impacts of climate change will be disproportionately borne by the poorest people in developing countries. The GEF supports projects in developing countries .
* [[Climate change mitigation]]: Reducing or avoiding greenhouse gas emissions in the areas of renewable energy; energy efficiency; sustainable transport; and management of [[land use, land-use change, and forestry]].
* [[Climate change adaptation]]: Aiming at developing countries to become climate-resilient by promoting immediate and longer-term adaptation measures in development policies, plans, programs, projects, and actions.

'''Chemicals''': [[Persistent organic pollutants]] (POPs) are pesticides, industrial chemicals, or unwanted by-products of industrial processes that have been used for decades but have more recently been found to share a number of disturbing characteristics, including:
* Persistence — they resist degradation in air, water, and sediments;
* Bio-accumulation — they accumulate in living tissues at concentrations higher than those in the surrounding environment;  
* Long-range transport — they can travel great distances from the source of release through air, water, and migratory animals, often contaminating areas thousands of kilometers away from any known source.

The GEF supports projects in eliminating the production and use of specific POPs, taking measures to ensure that POPs wastes are managed and disposed of in an environmentally sound manner, identifying the sources and reducing releases of POPs byproducts.

'''[[International waters]]''': Diversions of water for irrigation, bulk supply, and potable use, together with the pollution of common water bodies are creating cross-border tensions. These tensions also persist across the oceans, with three-quarters of fish stocks being overfished, fished at their maximum, or in a depleted state. The GEF supports projects in helping countries work together to overcome these tensions in large water systems and to collectively manage their transboundary surface water basins, groundwater basins, and coastal and marine systems in order to share the benefits from them.

'''[[Land degradation]]''': Land degradation is a major threat to biodiversity, ecosystem stability, and society’s ability to function. Because of the interconnectivity between ecosystems across scales, land degradation triggers destructive processes that can have cascading effects across the entire biosphere.  Loss of biomass through vegetation clearance and increased soil erosion produces greenhouse gases that contribute global warming and climate change. The GEF supports projects in reversing and preventing desertification/land degradation and in mitigating the effects of drought in affected areas in order to support poverty reduction and environmental sustainability.

'''[[Sustainable forest management]] / [[REDD]]+''': [[Forest]]s cover almost one-third of the world’s land area. They have a unique potential to produce multiple global environmental benefits such as [[biodiversity]] conservation, [[carbon sequestration]], and protection against [[desertification]]. Sustainably managed forests can enhance the provision of wood and [[non-timber forest product]]s for about 1.6 billion people depending on forests for their livelihoods. Forest ecosystems are also expected to play a key role in helping people in developing countries to adapt to the effects of climate change. The GEF supports projects in forest conservation (primarily [[protected area]]s and buffer zones), sustainable use of forests (forest production landscapes, sustainable forest management), and addressing forests and trees in the wider landscape.

'''[[Ozone depletion]]''': Increased [[UV-B]] radiation reaching the Earth would pose risks to human health and the environment. In response, countries negotiated and adopted the [[Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer]] in 1985, and the [[Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer]] in 1987. The GEF supports projects in developing countries and countries with economies in transition (CEITs) that are not eligible for funding under the Multilateral Fund of the Montreal Protocol, to implement activities to phase out ozone depleting substances (ODS) in a manner consistent with these countries’ obligations under the Montreal Protocol.

Besides these seven areas, the GEF has also worked on other programs including:
* Capacity development
* Country support programme
* [[Debt-for-nature swap]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.undp.org/content/sdfinance/en/home/solutions/debt-for-nature-swaps.html|title=Debt for Nature Swaps|website=UNDP}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Gender Mainstreaming
* Results and learning
* Earth fund and [[public-private partnerships]]
* Small grants programme&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sgp.undp.org|title=Welcome to The GEF Small Grants Programme|website=www.sgp.undp.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Small Island Developing States

'''ISO 3166-2:KN''' is the entry for [[Saint Kitts and Nevis]] in [[ISO 3166-2]], part of the [[ISO 3166]] [[standardization|standard]] published by the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO), which defines [[code]]s for the names of the principal [[country subdivision|subdivision]]s (e.g., [[province]]s or [[state (administrative division)|state]]s) of all [[country|countries]] coded in [[ISO 3166-1]].

Currently for Saint Kitts and Nevis, ISO 3166-2 codes are defined for two levels of subdivisions:
* 2 states (i.e., the islands of [[Saint Kitts]] and [[Nevis]])
* [[parishes of Saint Kitts and Nevis|14 parishes]]

Each code consists of two parts, separated by a hyphen. The first part is {{mono|KN}}, the [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2]] code of Saint Kitts and Nevis. The second part is either of the following:
* one letter: states
* two digits (01&amp;ndash;15 except 14): parishes

'''Ignazio (Egnatio or Egnazio) Danti''' (April 1536 – 19 October 1586), born '''Pellegrino Rainaldi Danti''', was an [[Italy|Italian]] [[priest]], [[mathematics|mathematician]], [[astronomy|astronomer]], and [[cosmography|cosmographer]].

==Biography==
[[File:Euclides - Optica, 1573 - 4254401 300033 00005.tif|thumb|upright|[[Euclid]]'s ''Optica'', translated by Danti]]

Danti was born in [[Perugia]] to a family rich in artists and scientists. As a boy he learned the rudiments of [[painting]] and [[architecture]] from his father Giulio, an architect and engineer who studied under [[Antonio da Sangallo the Younger|Antonio da Sangallo]], and his aunt Teodora, who was said to have studied under the painter [[Perugino]] and also wrote a commentary on [[Euclid]]. His older brother [[Vincenzo Danti]] would become one of the leading court sculptors of late-sixteenth-century Florence, while his younger brother [[Girolamo Danti]] (1547–1580) would become a local Perugian painter of little fame.

Danti entered the [[Dominican Order]] on 7 March 1555, changing his baptismal name from ''Pellegrino'' to ''Ignazio''. After completing his studies in philosophy and theology he gave some time to preaching, but soon devoted himself zealously to mathematics, astronomy, and geography.

In 1562, he requested a transfer from the Dominican compound in Perugia to the monastery of San Marco in [[Florence]]. Soon after, he found work on the side tutoring the children of wealthy Florentines in mathematics and science. In September 1563, he was invited by [[Cosimo I, Duke of Tuscany]] to participate in his great cosmographical project, the Guardaroba in the [[Palazzo Vecchio]]. Over the next dozen years, Danti would paint 30 maps of regions of the world (based largely upon published prints by [[Giacomo Gastaldi]], [[Abraham Ortelius]], [[Gerardus Mercator]], and others) upon the cabinet doors of the Guardaroba. He would also work on many other significant scientific and cosmographic projects in Florence, including the large terrestrial [[globe]] of the Guardaroba (1564–1568), and a number of brass scientific instruments (such as an astrolabe) today in the [[Museo Galileo]] in Florence. Between 1567 and 1569, [[Pius V]], who belonged to the Dominicans, is said to have commissioned Danti to furnish plans for the construction of a Dominican church and convent at [[Bosco Marengo]] in [[Piedmont]]; Danti acted mainly as an advisor. During his stay in [[Florence]], Danti taught mathematics and published over a dozen scientific treatises, mostly commentaries on ancient and medieval astronomy and mathematics or explanations of how to use scientific instruments.

For much of his time in Florence, Danti resided at the convent of [[Santa Maria Novella]], and designed the [[Quadrant (instrument)|quadrant]] (on the right) and the [[armillary sphere]] (on the left) that appear on the end blind arches of the lower facade of the church in 1572 and 1574, respectively. He also designed a large-scale [[gnomon]] for the church which would allow a thin beam of light to enter the church at noon each day through a hole just beneath the facade's rose window, although it probably was not completed by the time Danti left Florence.

There were also discussions between the Duke and Danti about building a [[canal]] to place Florence in communication with both the [[Mediterranean]] and the [[Adriatic]]. However, this grandiose plan never got underway before Cosimo's death in 1574. The following year Cosimo's son, Grand Duke [[Francesco de' Medici]], forced Danti to leave Florence (in late September 1575) on an uncertain morals charge. It is not known precisely why Francesco exiled Danti, but the Dominican had no trouble finding work or patrons anywhere else in Italy, although he never returned to Florence.

After leaving Florence, Danti became professor of mathematics at the [[University of Bologna]]. While occupying this chair he built a massive gnomon in the Bolognese church of [[San Petronio]], the [[meridian (geography)|meridian line]] of which is still visible in the church's pavement. He also spent some time in Perugia, at the invitation of the governor, where he prepared maps of the Perugian republic.

[[File:0 Italie - Corse - Sardaigne - Galleria delle carte geografiche.JPG|thumb|275 px|Map of [[:w:Italy|Italy]], [[Corsica]] and [[:w:Sardinia|Sardinia]] - [[Gallery of Maps]] - [[:w:Vatican Museums|Vatican Museums]]]]

On account of his mathematical attainments, [[Pope Gregory XIII]] invited him to Rome, appointed him pontifical mathematician and made him a member of the commission for the reform of the [[Gregorian Calendar|calendar]].  He also placed him in charge of the painters whom the Pope had summoned to the [[Vatican City|Vatican]] to continue the decoration of the palace, most notably to make a number of maps of the regions of modern Italy in the newly constructed [[Gallery of Maps]] along the [[Cortile del Belvedere]]. This remarkable project, begun in early 1580 and completed about 18 months later, maps the entirety of the Italian peninsula in 40 large-scale frescoes, each depicting a region as well as a perspective view of its most prominent city.

When the pontiff commissioned the architect [[Domenico Fontana]] to repair the Claudian harbour it was Danti who furnished the necessary plans. While at Rome Danti published a translation of a portion of [[Euclid]] with annotations and wrote a life of the architect [[Jacopo Barozzi da Vignola]], preparing also notes for the latter's work on perspective. In recognition of his labours Gregory, in 1583, made him [[Bishop of Alatri]] in the [[Campagna]]. Danti showed himself a zealous pastor in his new office.

As bishop of Alatri, Danti convoked a diocesan [[synod]], corrected many abuses, and showed great solicitude for the poor. Shortly before his death [[Pope Sixtus V]] summoned him to Rome to assist in the erection of the grand [[Obelisks in Rome|obelisk]] in the piazza of the Vatican.

Besides the works already mentioned, Danti was the author of ''Trattato del'uso e della fabbrica dell'astrolabo con la giunta del planifero del Raja''; ''Le Scienze matematiche ridotte in tavole'', also a revised and annotated edition of ''La Sfera di Messer G. Sacrobosco tradotta da Pier Vincenzio Danti''. The first mentioned work deals with the use and construction of the astrolabe and is one of the oldest instructions for scientific instruments. Danti provided with his book the first Italian treatise on this topic.&lt;ref&gt;Ralf Kern, ''Wissenschaftliche Instrumente in ihrer Zeit'', Vol. 1, Cologne: Koenig, 2010, p. 318.&lt;/ref&gt;

He died at Alatri, only three years into his service.  After Danti's death, in 1588 [[Giovanni Antonio Magini]] was chosen over [[Galileo]] to occupy the chair of mathematics at the University of Bologna.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7078">{{Lists of folk music traditions}}

This is a '''list of folk music traditions''', with styles, dances, instruments and other related topics.  The term ''[[folk music]]'' can not be easily defined in a precise manner; it is used with widely varying definitions depending on the author, intended audience and context within a work.  Similarly, the term ''traditions'' in this context does not connote any strictly-defined criteria.  Music scholars, journalists, audiences, record industry individuals, politicians, nationalists and demagogues may often have occasion to address which fields of folk music are distinct traditions based along racial, geographic, linguistic, religious, tribal or ethnic lines, and all such peoples will likely use different criteria to decide what constitutes a "folk music tradition".  This list uses the same general categories used by mainstream, primarily English-language, scholarly sources, as determined by relevant statements of fact and the internal structure of works.

These traditions may coincide entirely, partially or not at all with geographic, political, linguistic or cultural boundaries.  Very few, if any, music scholars would claim that there are any folk music traditions that can be considered specific to a distinct group of people and with characteristics undiluted by contact with the music of other peoples; thus, the folk music traditions described herein overlap in varying degrees with each other.

The '''Oulu Market Square''' is the main [[market square]] of the city of [[Oulu]], [[Finland]].

The market square is located in the city centre, in the [[Pokkinen]] district, on the waterfront of the Oulujoki river. The [[Rotuaari]] pedestrian zone starts from the square behind the [[Toripolliisi]] statue.

In addition to the traditional market stalls, many old warehouses restored as bars and restaurants are bordering the square nowadays. The [[Oulu Market Hall|market hall]] was opened on the square in 1901 mainly to get selling of meat out of the open square.

'''Masuria''' ({{Audio-pl|Mazury|Masuren.ogg}}, {{lang-de|Masuren}}, [[Masurian dialect|Masurian]]: ''Mazurÿ'') is a [[region]] in northern [[Poland]] famous for its [[New7Wonders of Nature|2,000 lakes]]. Before the end of [[World War II]], it was mostly inhabited by [[Polish language|Polish]]-speaking ([[Masurian dialect]]) [[Lutheran]] [[Masurians]] and constituted a part of [[East Prussia]]. Masuria occupies much of the [[Masurian Lake District]]. Administratively, it belongs to [[Warmian-Masurian Voivodeship]]. Its biggest city is [[Ełk]], often regarded as its capital. It has territory of about 10,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and population of 59 790 (2013).

== History ==
=== Old Prussians ===
{{further|Old Prussians}}

Before the 13th century, the territory was inhabited by the [[Old Prussians]] also called [[Balts|Baltic Prussians]], a Baltic [[ethnic group]] that lived in Prussia (the area of the southeastern coastal region of the Baltic Sea neighbouring of the Baltic Sea around the [[Vistula Lagoon]] and the [[Curonian Lagoon]]). The territory later called Masuria was then known as [[Galindia]] and was probably a peripheral, deeply forested and lightly populated area. Its inhabitants spoke a language now known as [[Old Prussian]] and had their own [[Prussian mythology|mythology]]. Although a 19th-century German political entity bore their name, they were not Germans. They were converted to [[Roman Catholicism]] in the 13th century, after [[Prussian Crusade|conquest]] by the [[Knights of the Teutonic Order]].

[[File:Prusy historyczne.png|thumb|upright=1.2|300px|Map of historical lands and regions in [[Prussia (region)|Prussia]]]]

Estimates range from about 170,000 to 220,000&amp;nbsp;Old Prussians living in the whole of Prussia around 1200.&lt;ref&gt;Kossert, Andreas: Ostpreussen, page 28&lt;/ref&gt; The wilderness was their natural barrier against attack by would-be invaders. During the [[Northern Crusades]] of the early 13th century, the Old Prussians used this wide forest as a line of defence. They did so again against the Knights of the [[Teutonic Order]], who had been invited to Poland by [[Konrad I of Masovia]] in 1226.&lt;ref name="britannica"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/589204/Teutonic-Order|title=Teutonic Order - religious order|publisher=|accessdate=14 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The order's goal was to convert the native population to [[Christianity]] and baptise it by force if necessary.  In the subsequent conquest, which lasted over 50 years, the original population was nearly exterminated, particularly during the major Prussian rebellion of 1261–83.&lt;ref name="britannica" /&gt;

=== Teutonic Order ===

After the Order's acquisition of Prussia, Poles (or more specifically, [[Mazurski|Mazurs]], that is inhabitants of the adjacent region of [[Mazovia]]) began to settle in the southeastern part of the conquered region. [[German people|German]], [[Dutch people|Dutch]], [[Flemings|Flemish]], and [[Danish people|Danish]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://worldcometomyhome.blogspot.com/2012/09/0335-poland-warmian-masurian-land-of.html|title=WORLD, COME TO MY HOME!: 0335 POLAND (Warmia-Masuria) - Land of a thousand lakes|first=Danut|last=Ivanescu|date=19 September 2012|publisher=|accessdate=14 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; colonists entered the area afterward, from the northwest. The number of [[Poles|Polish]] settlers grew significantly again in the beginning of the 15th century, especially after the [[Peace of Thorn (1411)|first]] and the [[Second Peace of Thorn (1466)|second]] treaties of Thorn, in 1411 and 1466 respectively, following the [[Thirteen Years' War (1454–66)|Thirteen Years' War]] and the final defeat of the order.&lt;ref name="britannica" /&gt; Later assimilation of the German settlers as well as the Polish immigrants and native inhabitants created the new Prussian identity, although the subregional difference between the German- and Slavic-speaking part remained. Western half of the province was ceded to Poland, and the grand master (still ruling, among others, also Masuria) became a vassal of the Polish crown.&lt;ref name="britannica" /&gt;

=== Ducal Prussia ===
[[Image:Święta Lipka, Bazylika Nawiedzenia NMP.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The sanctuary of [[St. Mary]] in [[Święta Lipka]] was consecrated by [[Jesuits]] in 1619. It was once the site of the apparitions and miracles]]

The secularization of the [[Teutonic Order]] in Prussia and the conversion of [[Albert I, Duke of Prussia|Albert of Prussia]] to [[Lutheranism]] in 1525 brought Prussia including the later called Masuria area to [[Protestantism]]. The [[Polish language]] predominated due to the many immigrants from [[Mazovia]], who additionally settled the eastern, till then virgin part of (later Masuria) in the 16th century. While the countryside was inhabited by Protestant Polish-speakers, who took refuge, the cities constituted German mixed with Polish-speaking population. The ancient [[Old Prussian language]] survived in parts of the countryside until the early 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.antimoon.com/forum/t12271.htm|title=What language did East Prussians speak? - Antimoon Forum|website=www.antimoon.com|accessdate=14 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Areas that had many Polish language speakers were known as the Polish Departments.&lt;ref&gt;Kossert, Andreas: Masuren, p. 81&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1656, during the [[Battle of Prostki]], the forces of [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]], including 2,000 [[Crimean Khanate|Tatar raiders]], beat the allied [[Sweden|Swedish]] and [[Brandenburg-Prussia|Brandenburg]] army capturing [[Bogusław Radziwiłł]]. The war resulted in the destruction of most towns, 249 villages and settlements and 37 churches were destroyed. Over 50% of the population of southern Prussia (later Masuria) died within the years 1656–1657, 23,000 killed, another 80,000 died of diseases and famine, 3,400 people were enslaved.&lt;ref&gt;Kossert, Andreas: Masuren, p. 74&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="prostki"&gt;Sławomir Augusiewicz, ''Prostki 1656'', [[Bellona Publishing House|Bellona]] Publishing, [[Warsaw]] 2001. {{ISBN|978-83-11-09323-2}}&lt;br /&gt;'''^''' Jacek Płosiński, ''Potop szwedzki na Podlasiu 1655-1657'', Inforteditions Publishing, 2006. {{ISBN|83-89943-07-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  From 1709–1711, in all of East Prussia between 200,000 and 245,000 out of 600,000 inhabitants died from the [[Black Death]]. in Masuria the death toll varied regionally, while 6,789 people died in the district of Rhein (Rhyn) only 677 died in Seehesten (Szestno). In Lötzen (Giżycko) 800 out of 919 people died.&lt;ref&gt;Kossert, Andreas: Ostpreussen, p. 96&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kossert, Andreas: Masuren, p. 85&lt;/ref&gt;  Losses in population were compensated by migration of Protestant settlers or refugees from [[Scotland]], [[Salzburg]] ([[Salzburg#Religious conflict|expulsion of Protestants 1731]]), [[France]] ([[Huguenot]] refugees after the [[Edict of Fontainebleau]] in 1685), and especially from the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]], including [[Polish brethren]] expelled from Poland in 1657. The last group of refugees to emigrate to Masuria were the [[Russia]]n [[Philipons]] in 1830, when King [[Frederick William III of Prussia]] granted them asylum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.taz.de/4/reise/europa/polen/begegnungen-am-gruenen-fluss/|title=Begegnungen am grünen Fluss|first1=Gabriele|last1=Lesser|publisher=[[Die Tageszeitung]]|language=German|access-date=2009-10-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091002010621/http://www.taz.de/4/reise/europa/polen/begegnungen-am-gruenen-fluss|archive-date=2009-10-02|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Kingdom of Prussia ===
After the death of [[Albert Frederick, Duke of Prussia]] in 1618, his son-in-law [[John Sigismund, Margrave of Brandenburg]], inherited the duchy (including Masuria), combining the two territories under a single dynasty and forming [[Brandenburg-Prussia]]. The [[Treaty of Wehlau]] revoked the sovereignty of the King of Poland in 1657. The region became part of the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] with the coronation of King [[Frederick I of Prussia]] in 1701. Masuria became part of the newly created administrative province of [[East Prussia]] upon its creation in 1773. The name ''Masuria'' began to be used officially after new administrative reforms in the Kingdom after 1818.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://visit.olsztyn.eu/en/category/2/the-history-of-olsztyn|title=The history of Olsztyn - zobacz The history of Olsztyn|website=visit.olsztyn.eu|accessdate=14 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Masurians referred to themselves during that period as "Polish Prussians" or as "Staroprusaki" (Old Prussians)&lt;ref name=Wang&gt;{{cite book|url= 
https://books.google.com/books?hl=de&amp;id=Y0b6HKgl9ewC&amp;dq=faces+of+clio&amp;q=Germanization+Masuria#v=snippet&amp;q=Germanization%20Masuria&amp;f=false

Masurians showed considerable support for the Polish uprising in 1831, and maintained many contacts with Russian-held areas of Poland beyond the border of Prussia, the areas being connected by common culture and language; before the uprising people visited each other's country fairs and much trade took place, with smuggling also widespread&lt;ref name=Wang/&gt; Some early writers about Masurians - like [[Max Toeppen]] - postulated them as mediators between German and Slav cultures.&lt;ref name= Wang/&gt;
[[Germanisation]] policies in Masuria included various strategies, first and foremost they included attempts to propagate the [[German language]] and to eradicate the Polish language as much as possible; German became the obligatory language in schools in 1834.&lt;ref name=Wang/&gt;

=== German Empire ===
After the [[Unification of Germany]] into the [[German Empire]] in 1871, the Polish language was removed from schools in 1872, as part of [[Otto von Bismarck]]'s [[Kulturkampf|Culture War]]. He also sought to eradicate the use of the Polish language and culture in the German Empire. After 1871 Masurians who expressed sympathy for Poland were deemed "national traitors" by German nationalists (this increased especially after 1918)&lt;ref name=Wang/&gt; According to Stefan Berger after 1871 the Masurians in the German Empire were seen in a view that while acknowledging their "objective" Polishness (in terms of culture and language) they felt "subjectively" German and thus should be tightly integrated into German nation-state; to Berger this argument went directly against the German nationalist demands in [[Alsace]] where [[Alsatians (people)|Alsatians]] were declared German despite their "subjective" choice. Berger concludes that such the arguments of German nationalists were simply aimed at gaining as much territory as possible into German Reich.&lt;ref name=Wang/&gt;
During the period of German Empire the Germanisation policies in Masuria became more effective; children using Polish in playgrounds and classrooms were widely punished by corporal punishment, authorities tried to appoint Protestant pastors who would use German instead of Polish which resulted in protests of local population.&lt;ref name=Wang/&gt; According to Jerzy Mazurek the native Polish-speaking population, like in other areas with Polish inhabitants, faced severe discrimination from Germanised local administration, in this climate first resistance defending the rights of rural population was formed; according to Jerzy Mazurek usually, teachers engaged in publishing Polish language newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;Kraj a emigracja: ruch ludowy wobec wychodźstwa chłopskiego do krajów Ameryki Łacińskiej (do 1939 roku) Jerzy Mazurek, page 281, Biblioteka Iberyjska, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kętrzyn Widok ogólny miasta z kościołem Św. Katarzyny.JPG|thumb|right|The town of [[Kętrzyn]] was named after Wojciech Kętrzyński in 1946 as part of the region's [[Polonisation]]. Its previous Polish name was "Rastembork"]]

Despite anti-Polish policies, such Polish language newspapers as the ''Pruski Przyjaciel Ludu'' (Prussian Friend of People) or the ''Kalendarz Królewsko-Pruski Ewangelicki'' (Royal Prussian Evangelical Calendar) or bilingual journals like the ''Oletzkoer Kreisblatt - Tygodnik Obwodu Oleckiego'' continued to be published in Masuria. In contrast to the Prussian-oriented periodicals, in the late 19th century such newspapers as ''Przyjaciel Ludu Łecki'' and ''Mazur'' were founded by members of the [[Warsaw]]-based ''Komitet Centralny dla Śląska, Kaszub i Mazur'' (Central Committee for Silesia, [[Kashubia]] and Masuria), influenced by Polish politicians like [[Antoni Osuchowski]] or [[Juliusz Bursche]], to strengthen the Polish identity in Masuria.&lt;ref&gt;Kossert, Andreas: Masuren, p. 209&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Gazeta Ludowa'' was published in [[Lyck]] in 1896–1902, with 2,500 copies in 1897 and the ''Mazur'' in [[Ortelsburg]] after 1906&amp;nbsp;with 500&amp;nbsp;copies in 1908&amp;nbsp;and 2,000&amp;nbsp;prior to World War I.&lt;ref name="Andreas Kossert, Masuren, p. 210"&gt;{{Cite book|url=|title=Masuren, Ostpreussens vergessener Süden|first1=Andreas|last1=Kossert|publisher=Pantheon|year=2006|isbn=3-570-55006-0|pages=210, 211|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After 1871 there appeared resistance among the Masurians towards Germanisation efforts, the so-called Gromadki movement was formed which supported use of Polish language and came into conflict with German authorities; while most of its members viewed themselves as loyal to Prussian state, a part of them joined the Pro-Polish faction of Masurians.&lt;ref name=Wang377/&gt; German actions like [[Kulturkampf]], the programme of Germanisation started to unite and mobilise Polish people in Polish inhabited territories held by Germany including Masuria&lt;ref&gt;A history of Eastern Europe: crisis and change Robert Bideleux, Ian Jeffries, page 293, Taylor &amp; Francis, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; A Polish-oriented party, the ''[[Mazurska Partia Ludowa]]'' ("People's Party of Masuria"), was founded in 1897. The eastern area of German Empire was systematically Germanised with changing of names and public signs, and the German state fostered cultural imperialism, in addition to giving financial and other support to German farmers, officials and teachers to settle in the east.&lt;ref&gt;A history of eastern Europe: crisis and change Robert Bideleux, Ian Jeffries page 180, Routledge; 1st edition 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

The German authorities in their efforts of Germanisation tried somewhat artificially to separate Masurian language from Polish by classifying it as non-[[Slav]]ic&lt;ref name="histclo.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://histclo.com/country/ger/reg/pru/grp-mas.html|title=German regions Prussia World War II|website=histclo.com|accessdate=14 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; language different from Polish one, this was reflected in official census&lt;ref&gt;Wang, Q. Edward; Fillafer, Franz L. (2007). The many faces of Clio: cross-cultural approaches to historiography. Berghahn Books. p. 375.&lt;/ref&gt;
Thus the Masurian population in 1890, 143,397&amp;nbsp;were reported by German officials as having German as their language (either primary or secondary), 152,186 Polish and 94,961 [[Masurian language|Masurian]]. In 1910, the German language was reported by German authorities as used by 197,060, Polish by 30,121 and Masurian by 171,413. In 1925, German authorities reported 40,869 as giving Masurian as their native tongue and 2,297&amp;nbsp; as Polish. However, the last result may have been a result of politics at the time and a desire to present the province as purely German; in reality the Masurian dialect was still in use.&lt;ref name="histclo.com"/&gt;

Throughout [[industrialisation]] in the late 19th century about 10 percent of the Masurian populace emigrated to the [[Ruhr Area]], where about 180,000&amp;nbsp;Masurians lived in 1914. [[Wattenscheid]], [[Wanne-Eickel|Wanne]] and [[Gelsenkirchen]] were the centres of Masurian emigration and Gelsenkirchen-[[Schalke]] was even called Klein (little)-[[Ortelsburg]] before 1914. Masurian newspapers like the ''Przyjaciel Ewangeliczny'' and the ''Gazeta Polska dla Ludu staropruskiego w Westfalii i na Mazurach'' but also the German language ''Altpreußische Zeitung'' were published.&lt;ref&gt;Kossert, Andreas: Masuren, p. 219&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Arys Orzysz 011.jpg|thumb| Destructions of World War I at [[Orzysz|Arys]] (Orzysz)]]

During [[World War I]], the [[Battle of Tannenberg (1914)|Battle of Tannenberg]] and the [[First Battle of the Masurian Lakes|First]] and [[Second Battle of the Masurian Lakes]] between Imperial Germany and the [[Russian Empire]] took place within the borders of Masuria in 1914. After the war, the [[League of Nations]] held the [[East Prussian plebiscite]] on 11&amp;nbsp;July 1920 to determine if the people of the southern districts of East Prussia wanted to remain within East Prussia or to join the [[Second Polish Republic]]. The German side terrorised the local population before the plebiscite using violence, Polish organisations and activists were harassed by German militias, and those actions included attacks and murder of Polish activists;&lt;ref&gt;Najnowsza historia Polski 1914-1993 Andrzej Albert, Wojciech Roszkowski Puls, page 95, 1994&lt;/ref&gt; Masurs who supported voting for Poland were singled out and subjected to terror and repressions.&lt;ref&gt;Problemy narodowościowe w Kościele ewangelickim na Mazurach w latach 1918-1945, page 43 Ryszard Otello, Ośrodek Badań Naukowych im. Wojciecha Kętrzyńskiego w Olsztynie, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

Names of those Masurs supporting the Polish side were published in German newspapers, and their photos presented in German shops; afterwards a regular hunts were organised after them by German militias which terrorized the Polish population.&lt;ref&gt;Szkice z dziejów Pomorza: Pomorze na progu dziejów najnowszych Gerard Labuda, Książka i Wiedza, 1961&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Historia Polski: 1914-1993 Wojciech Roszkowski Wydawnictwo Naukowe PWN 1994:"Podobnie jak na Śląsku, bojówki niemieckie szerzyły wśród ludności polskiej terror".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Historia Warmii i Mazur: od pradziejów do 1945 roku, page 251, Stanisław Achremczyk - 1992&lt;/ref&gt; At least 3,000 Warmian and Masurian activists who were engaged for Polish side had to flee the region out of fear of their lives.&lt;ref&gt;Kiermasy na Warmii i inne pisma wybrane
Walenty Barczewski, page 14 Pojezierze,&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time German police engaged in active surveillance of the Polish minority and attacks against Polish activists.&lt;ref&gt;Plebiscyty na Warmii, Mazurach i Powiślu w 1920 roku: wybór źródeł, Piotr Stawecki, Wojciech Wrzesiński, Zygmunt Lietz, page 13, Ośrodek badań naukowych 1986&lt;/ref&gt; Before the plebiscite Poles started to flee the region to escape the German harassment and Germanisation policies.&lt;ref&gt;Wojciech Wrzesiński, ''Ruch polski na Warmii, Mazurach i Powiślu w latach 1920-1939'', 1973, page 40.&lt;/ref&gt;

The results determined that 99.32% of the voters in Masuria proper chose to remain with East Prussia. Notwithstanding national German agitation and intimidation, these results refect a successful proces of Germanisation at that time going on for more than half a century. In majority Mazurians had adopt a German national identity next to a regional, so to call ethnic, identity. Their traditional religious belief in [[Lutheranism]] kept them away from Polish national consciousness, dominated by [[Roman Catholicism]]. In fact almost only catholics voted for Poland in the plebiscite. They were to be found as a majority in the villages around the capital [[Olsztyn|Allenstein]], the same were Polish cultural activism got hold between 1919 and 1932.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifz-muenchen.de/heftarchiv/2003_2_1_kossert.pdf|title="Grenzlandpolitik" und Ostforschung an der Peripherie des Reiches|first1=Andreas|last1=Kossert|publisher=[[Institut für Zeitgeschichte]]|year=2003|isbn=|page=124|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the contemporary Polish ethnographer [[Adam Chętnik]] accused the German authorities of abuses and falsifications during the plebiscite.&lt;ref name="chetnik"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zwiazekkurpiow.pl/portrety.php?subaction=showfull&amp;id=1200333025&amp;archive=&amp;start_from=&amp;ucat=29&amp;|title=Związek Kurpiów|first=Krzysztof Perłakowski,|last=admin@ok.info.pl|website=www.zwiazekkurpiow.pl|accessdate=14 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the plebiscite took place during the time when [[Polish–Soviet War]] threatened to erase the Polish state. As a result, even many Poles of the region voted for Germany out of fear that if the area was allocated to Poland it would fall under [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] rule.&lt;ref&gt;Debo, Richard K., "Survival and consolidation: the foreign policy of Soviet Russia, 1918-1921", McGill-Queen's Press, 1992, pg. 335&lt;/ref&gt; After the plebiscite in German areas of Masuria attacks on Polish population commenced by German mobs, and Polish priests and politicians were driven from their homes&lt;ref&gt;Kazimierz Jaroszyk, ''1878-1941: o narodowy kształt Warmii i Mazur''.

This was reasoned with placing the railway connection between [[Warsaw]] and [[Danzig]] (Gdańsk), of vital importance to Poland as it connected central Poland with its seacoast, completely under Polish sovereignty. Działdowo itself counted about 24,000 people of which 18,000 were Masurians.&lt;ref&gt;Andrzej Sakson, ''Mazurzy: Społeczność pogranicza'', Instytut Zachodni, 1990, page 59.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the municipal administration of [[Gmina Rybno, Warmian-Masurian Voivodeship|Rybno]], after World War I Poles in Działdowo believed that they will be quickly joined with Poland,&lt;ref name="Koszelewy page 5"&gt;Plan odnowy miejscowości Koszelewy, Rys historyczny, page 5 Załącznik do Uchwały Nr XLII/9 /10 Rady Gminy Rybno z dnia 23 lutego 2010 r.&lt;/ref&gt; they organised secret gatherings during which the issue of rejoining Polish state with help of Polish military was discussed.&lt;ref name="Koszelewy page 5"/&gt; According to the Rybno administration most active Poles in that subregion included Jóżwiakowscy, Wojnowscy, Grzeszczowscy families working under the guidance of politician Leon Wojnowski who protested German attempts to remain Działdowo a part of Germany after the war; other local pro-Polish activists were Alfred Wellenger, Paczyński, Tadeusz Bogdański, Jóźwiakowski.&lt;ref name="Koszelewy page 5"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Słownik biograficzny Warmii, Mazur i Powiśla XIX i XX wieku(do 1945 roku), Tadeusz Oracki, page 334, Instytut Wydawniczy Pax 1983&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Interludium mazurskie:wspomnienia 1920-1939, Karol Małłek, page 11, Czytelnik, 1968&lt;/ref&gt;

The historian Andreas Kossert describes that the incorporation happened despite protests of the local populace, the municipal authorities and the German Government,&lt;ref&gt;Andreas Kossert: Masuren - Ostpreussens vergessener Süden, 2006, page 284: "Als in Soldau bekannt wurde, dass das Gebiet ohne Abstimmung an Polen fallen sollte, entluden sich Wut, Trauer und Bestürzung. Hilflos sah sich die Soldauer Bevölkerung ohne jede Mitsprache der Entscheidung des Siegers ausgesetzt. Alle Proteste blieben vergeblich. Kommunale Körperschaften verwahrten sich einhellig gegen die Abtretung, führende deutsche Politiker - allen voran Reichspräsident Friedrich Ebert - versuchten noch bis zur letzten Minute die alliierte Entscheidung rückgängig zu machen" (When it became known in Soldau that the area should fall to Poland without a vote, anger, sadness and dismay erupted. The Soldau population saw themselves helplessly and without a voice exposed to the decision of the winners. All protests were in vain. Local authorities unanimously opposed the cession, leading German politicians - led by President Friedrich Ebert - tried until the last minute to reverse the Allied decision.)&lt;/ref&gt; According to Kossert 6,000 inhabitants of the region soon left the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Masuren, Ostpreussens vergessener Süden|first1=Andreas|last1=Kossert|publisher=Pantheon |year=2006|isbn=3-570-55006-0|pages=283, 284|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1920 the candidate of the German Party, Ernst Barczewski, was elected to the [[Sejm]] with 74.6 percent of votes and to the [[Polish Senate]] with 34.6% of votes for the [[Bloc of National Minorities]] in 1928.&lt;ref&gt;Andreas Kossert, Masuren - Ostpreussens vergessener Süden, 2006, p.284&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Polish–Soviet War]] Działdowo was briefly occupied by the [[Red Army]] and were regarded as liberators by the local German populace, which hoisted the German flag,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1920/08/16/96892651.pdf|title=NY Times report|publisher=|accessdate=14 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=80r6Mbnxf8IC&amp;pg=PA37&amp;vq=soldau&amp;hl=de&amp;source=gbs_search_r&amp;cad=1_1Richard|title=Orphans of Versailles: The Germans in Western Poland, 1918-1939|first=Richard|last=Blanke|publisher=University Press of Kentucky|accessdate=14 August 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it was soon recovered by the [[Polish Army]].

Masuria was the only region of Germany directly affected by the battles of World War I. Damaged towns and villages were reconstructed with the aid of several twin towns from western Germany like [[Cologne]] to [[Neidenburg]], [[Frankfurt]] to [[Lötzen]] and even [[Vienna]] to [[Ortelsburg]]. However Masuria was still largely agrarian-oriented and suffered from the economic decline after World War I, additionally badly affected by the creation of the [[Polish Corridor]], which raised freight costs to the traditional markets in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Kossert, Andreas: Masuren, p. 264&lt;/ref&gt;
The later implemented [[Osthilfe]] had only a minor influence on Masuria as it privileged larger estates, while Masurian farms were generally small.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ostpreussen.

In the 1920s Masuria remained a heartland of conservatism with the [[German National People's Party]] as strongest party.&lt;ref&gt;Kossert, Andreas: Masuren, p. 294&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gonschior.de/weimar/Preussen/Ostpreussen/PL2.html|title=Ostpreußen: Wahl zum Provinziallandtag 1925|website=www.gonschior.de|accessdate=14 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Blanke/&gt; The [[Nazi Party]] became the strongest party in the Masurian constituencies in the elections of 1930&lt;ref name=Blanke&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vNV5uIIKJjkC&amp;pg=PA55&amp;dq=Masuria+Prussia#v=onepage&amp;q=NSDAP%20Masuria&amp;f=false|title=Polish-speaking Germans?

In 1938, the [[Nazism|Nazi]] government (1933–1945) changed thousands of toponyms (especially names of cities and villages) of Old Prussian and Polish origin to newly created German names; about 50% of the existing names were changed in 1938&amp;nbsp;alone,&lt;ref&gt;Bernd Martin, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; despite resistance by the Prussian people, who continued to use their traditional place names.

Before the war the Nazi German state sent undercover operatives to spy on Polish organisations and created lists of people that were to be executed or sent to concentration camps.&lt;ref name="Maria"/&gt; Information was gathered on who sent children to Polish schools, bought Polish press or took part in Polish ceremonies and organised repressions against these people were executed by Nazi militias.&lt;ref name="Maria"/&gt; Polish schools, printing presses and headquarters of Polish institutions were attacked as well as homes of the most active Poles; shops owned by Poles were vandalised or demolished.&lt;ref name="Maria"/&gt; Polish masses were dispersed, and Polish teachers were intimidated as members of the [[SS]] gathered under their locals performing songs like "Wenn das Polenblut vom Messer spritzt, dann geht’s noch mal so gut" ("When Polish blood spurts from the knife, everything will be better").&lt;ref name="Maria"&gt;Maria Wardzyńska: "Intelligenzaktion" na Warmii, Mazurach oraz Północnym Mazowszu.

The anti-Polish activities intensified in 1939.&lt;ref name="Maria"/&gt; Those Poles were most active in politics were evicted from their own homes, while Polish newspapers and cultural houses were closed down in the region.&lt;ref name="Maria"/&gt; Polish masses were banned between June and July in [[Warmia]] and Mazury.&lt;ref name="Maria"/&gt;

In the final moments of August 1939 all remains of political and cultural life of Polish minority was eradicated by the Nazis, with imprisonment of Polish activists and liquidation of Polish institutions.&lt;ref name="Maria"/&gt; Seweryn Pieniężny, the chief editor of "Gazeta Olsztyńska", who opposed Germanisation of Masuria, was interned. Others included Juliusz Malewski (director of Bank Ludowy of Olsztyn), Stefan Różycki, Leon Włodarczyk (activist of Polonia Warmińsko-Mazurska).&lt;ref name="Maria"/&gt;

Directors of Polish schools and teachers were imprisoned, as was the staff of Polish pre-schools in the Masuria region.&lt;ref name="Maria"/&gt; They were often forced to destroy Polish signs, emblems and symbols of Polish institutions.&lt;ref name="Maria"/&gt;

==== World War II ====

The Nazis believed that in future, the Masurs, as a separate non-German entity, would disappear, while those who would cling to their "foreigness" as one Nazi report mentioned, would be deported.&lt;ref&gt;Germany Turns Eastwards: A Study of Ostforschung in the Third Reich by Michael Burleigh, page 209, 1988, Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt; Local Jews were considered by the Nazis to be subhuman and were to be exterminated. The Nazi authorities also murdered Polish activists in Masuria and those who remained alive were sent to concentration camps.&lt;ref&gt;Słownik geograficzno-krajoznawczy Polski

In August 1943 the [[Uderzeniowe Bataliony Kadrowe]] [[Raid on Mittenheide|attacked the village of Mittenheide (Turośl)]] in southern Masuria&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.rzeczpospolita.pl/specjal_040612/specjal_a_8.html |title=Kazimierz Krajewski, Shock in the Reich, Rzeczpospolita Daily |access-date=2011-02-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605071645/http://www.rzeczpospolita.pl/specjal_040612/specjal_a_8.html |archive-date=2011-06-05 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1943 "Związek Mazurski" was reactivated secretly by Masurian activists of the [[Polish Underground State]] in Warsaw and led by Karol Małłek.&lt;ref&gt;Literatura polska w latach II wojny światowej Jerzy Świe̢ch, Instytut Badań Literackich (Polska Akademia Nauk), page 42
Wydawnictwo Naukowe PWN,&lt;/ref&gt; Związek Mazurski opposed Nazi Germany and asked Polish authorities during the war to liquidate German property after victory over Nazi Germany to help in agricultural reform and settlement of Masurian population, Masurians opposed to Nazi Germany requested to remove German heritage sites "regardless of their cultural value".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.muzeum.ketrzyn.pl/palace6.htm Pałace i dwory powiatu kętrzyńskiego - wartości historyczne i kulturowe] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040718035121/http://www.muzeum.ketrzyn.pl/palace6.htm |date=2004-07-18 }} Muzeum im Wojciecha Kętrzyńsiego w Kętrzynie&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally a [[Masurian Institute]] was founded by Masurian activists in Radość near Warsaw in 1943&lt;ref name="O nas"&gt;[http://www.obn.olsztyn.pl/index1.php?id=o_nas/o_nas O nas] Ośrodek Badań Naukowych imienia Wojciecha Kętrzyńskiego w Olsztynie&lt;/ref&gt;

In the final stages of [[World War II]], Masuria was partially devastated by the retreating [[Wehrmacht|German]] and advancing [[Red Army|Soviet]] armies during the [[Vistula-Oder Offensive]]. The region came under Polish rule at the war's end in the [[Potsdam Conference]]. Most of the population fled to Germany or was killed during or after the war, while the rest was subject to a "nationality verification", organised by the [[History of Poland (1945–1989)|communist government]] of Poland. As a result, the number of native Masurians remaining in Masuria was initially relatively high, while most of the population was subsequently [[expulsion of Germans after World War II|expelled]]. Poles from central Poland and the [[Polish areas annexed by the Soviet Union]] as well as [[Ukrainians]] expelled from southern Poland throughout the [[Operation Vistula]], were resettled in Masuria.&lt;ref&gt;Andreas Kossert, Ostpreussen, Geschichte und Mythos p. 352; Kossert gives 35 % from Central Poland, 22.6 % from Eastern Poland, 10 % victims of Op. Vistula, 18.5 % Natives in 1950&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Masuria after World War II ===
[[File:Budynek w Parku etnograficznym w Węgorzewie.jpg|thumb|right|A reconstructed Masurian house in an open-air museum near [[Węgorzewo]]]]
According to the Masurian Institute the Masurian members of resistance against Nazi Germany who survived the war, became active in 1945 in the region, working in [[Olsztyn]] in cooperation with new state authorities in administration, education and cultural affairs.&lt;ref name="O nas"/&gt;

German author Andreas Kossert describes the post-war process of "national verification" as based on an ethnic racism which categorised the local populace according to their alleged ethnic background.&lt;ref&gt;Kossert, Andreas: Masuren, p.363, 364: "Ähnlich wie die NS-Volkslisten seit 1939 im Reichsgau Wartheland und in Danzig-Westpreussen die Germanisierbarkeit der dort lebenden Deutschen und kleiner polnischer Gruppen festlegte, indem sie sie nach einem biologischen Rassismus in vier Kategorien einteilten, nahm die polnische Provinzverwaltung nach 1945 eine Klassifizierung der Bewohner Masurens nach einem ethnischen Rassismus vor."&lt;/ref&gt; A Polish-sounding last name or a Polish-speaking ancestor was sufficient to be regarded as "autochthonous" Polish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vNV5uIIKJjkC&amp;pg=PA287&amp;dq=autochthons+poland#v=onepage&amp;q=autochton&amp;f=false

In October 1946 37,736 persons were "verified" as Polish citizens while 30,804 remained "unverified". A centre of such "unverified" Masurians was the district of [[Mrągowo]] (Sensburg), where in early 1946 out of 28,280 persons, 20,580 were "unverified", while in October, 16,385 still refused to adopt Polish citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ostpreussen. Geschichte und Mythos|first1=Andreas|last1=Kossert|publisher=Siedler|year=2005|isbn=3-88680-808-4|page=353|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; However even those who complied with the often used pressure by Polish authorities were in fact treated as Germans because of their Lutheran faith and their often rudimentary knowledge of Polish. Names were "Polonised" and the usage of the German language in public was forbidden. In the late 1940s the pressure to sign the "verification documents" grew and in February 1949 the former chief of the [[Ministry of Public Security of Poland|stalinist secret Police (UB)]] of [[Łódź]], [[Mieczysław Moczar]], started the "Great verification" campaign. Many unverified Masurians were imprisoned and accused of pro-Nazi or pro-American propaganda, even former pro-Polish activists and inmates of Nazi concentration camps were jailed and tortured. After the end of this campaign in the district of Mrągowo (Sensburg) only 166 Masurians were still "unverified".&lt;ref&gt;Kossert, Andreas: Masuren, p. 366&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1950 1,600&amp;nbsp;Masurians left the country and in 1951, 35,000&amp;nbsp;people from Masuria and [[Warmia]] managed to obtain a declaration of their German nationality by the embassies of the United States and Great Britain in Warsaw. Sixty-three percent of the Masurians in the district of Mrągowo (Sensburg) received such a document.&lt;ref&gt;Kossert, Andreas: Masuren, p. 367&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1956 Masurian pro-Polish activists signed a memorandum to the Communist Party leadership:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The history of the people of Warmia and Masuria is full of tragedy and suffering. Injustice, hardship and pain often pressed on the shoulders of Warmians and Masurians... Dislike, injustice and violence surrounds us...They (Warmians and Masurians) demand respect for their differentness, grown in the course of seven centuries and for freedom to maintain their traditions".&lt;ref&gt;Andreas Kossert :”Masuren”, pp. 371, 372&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Pasym Kościół ewangelicko-augsburski 03.jpg|thumb|right|An active [[Lutheran]] church in [[Pasym]]]]

Soon after the political reforms of 1956, Masurians were given the opportunity to join their families in [[West Germany]]. The majority (over 100&amp;nbsp;thousand) gradually left and after the improvement of [[Germany|Germano]]-[[Poland|Polish]] relations by the German [[Ostpolitik]] of the 1970s, 55,227&amp;nbsp;persons from Warmia and Masuria moved to West Germany in between 1971&amp;nbsp;and 1988,&lt;ref name=AK,358&gt;{{cite book|title=Ostpreussen.

Wróblewski]] stated, the Polish post-war policy succeeded in what the Prussian state never managed: the creation of a German national consciousness among the Masurians.&lt;ref name=AK,358/&gt;

Most of the originally [[Protestantism|Protestant]] churches in Masuria are now used by the Polish [[Roman Catholic Church]] as the number of Lutherans in Masuria declined from 68,500&amp;nbsp;in 1950&amp;nbsp;to 21,174&amp;nbsp;in 1961 and further to 3,536&amp;nbsp;in 1981. Sometimes, like on 23&amp;nbsp;September 1979&amp;nbsp;in the village of [[Spychowo]] (Puppen), the Lutheran Parish was even forcefully driven out of their church while liturgy was held.&lt;ref name=AK,358/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3eNOIYcwnmwC&amp;pg=PA116&amp;lpg=PA116&amp;dq=puppen+ortelsburg

=== Modern Masuria ===
In modern Masuria the native population has virtually disappeared.&lt;ref name=Eberhardt/&gt; Masuria was incorporated into the [[Voivodeships of Poland#Polish voivodeships 1945-1975 (14+2/17+5)|voivodeship system]] of administration in 1945. In 1999 Masuria was constituted with neighbouring [[Warmia]] as a single administrative province through the creation of the [[Warmian-Masurian Voivodeship]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www10.dict.cc/wp_examples.php?lp_id=1&amp;lang=en&amp;s=Masurian&lt;/ref&gt;

The Masurian [[Szczytno-Szymany International Airport]] gained international attention as press reports alleged the airport to be a so-called ''"[[black site]]"'' involved in the [[CIA]]'s network of [[extraordinary renditions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/6212843.stm

Masuria and the [[Masurian Lake District]] are known in Polish as ''Kraina Tysiąca Jezior'' and in German as ''Land der Tausend Seen'', meaning "land of a thousand lakes." These lakes were ground out of the land by glaciers during the [[Pleistocene]] [[Quaternary glaciation|ice age]] around 14,000 - 15,000 years ago, when ice covered northeastern Europe. From that period originates the horn of a reindeer found in the vicinity of [[Giżycko]].&lt;ref name="goldap"&gt;{{pl icon}} [http://www.dkgoldap.fr.pl/publikacje/pliki/krajobraz.pdf Krajobraz kulturowy powiatu gołdapskiego, at www.dkgoldap.fr.pl] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100601114809/http://www.dkgoldap.fr.pl/publikacje/pliki/krajobraz.pdf |date=2010-06-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  By 10,000 BC this ice started to melt. Great geological changes took place and even in the last 500 years the maps showing the lagoons and peninsulas on the [[Baltic Sea]] have greatly altered in appearance. More than in other parts of northern Poland, such as from [[Pomerania]] (from the [[Oder|River Oder]] to the [[Vistula|River Vistula]]), this continuous stretch of lakes is popular among tourists. The terrain is rather hilly, with connecting lakes, rivers and streams. Forests account for about 30% of the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{pl icon}} [http://www.strefamazury.pl/object_info/wm/3/przyroda Mazury, at www.strefamazury.pl] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100730125021/http://strefamazury.pl/object_info/wm/3/przyroda |date=2010-07-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{pl icon}} [http://www.bryk.pl/teksty/liceum/geografia/geografia_spo%C5%82eczno_ekonomiczna/19622-charakterystyka_pojezierza_mazurskiego_i_wigierskiego_parku_narodowego.html Charakterystyka Pojezierza Mazurskiego, at www.bryk.pl]&lt;/ref&gt; The northern part of Masuria is covered mostly by the broadleaved forest, while the southern part is dominated by [[pine]] and [[Temperate broadleaf and mixed forests|mixed forests]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.856.8111&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf|title=Download Limit Exceeded|website=citeseerx.ist.psu.edu|accessdate=14 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.e-masuria.com/|title=Masuria - Krutyn - Boat and canoeing trips on the Krutynia River|website=www.e-masuria.com|accessdate=14 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Maulino forest''' ({{lang-es|Bosque Maulino}}) is a forest type naturally growing in the [[Chilean Coast Range]] of [[Central Chile]] from latitude 35°55 to 36°20 S. The chief tree species is ''[[Nothofagus glauca]]''. Other tree species include ''[[Nothofagus leonii]]'', ''[[Nothofagus alessandri]]'' and ''[[Gomorterga keule]]''. The forest grows at a transition zone between [[Mediterranean climate]] to [[oceanic climate|humid temperate climate]]. Precipitations vary from 1000 to 700 mm/a and are concentrated in winter.&lt;ref name=SanmayDonoso95&gt;{{cite book |last=San Martín |first=José |last2=Donoso |first2=Claudio|author-link2=Claudio Donoso |date=1995|editor-last=Armesto|editor-first=Juan J. |editor-last2=Villagrán|editor-first2=Carolina|editor-last3=Arroyo|editor-first3=Mary Kalin|editor-link2=Carolina Villagrán|editor-link3=Mary Kalin Arroyo |title=Ecología de los bosques nativos de Chile|chapter=Estructura florística e impacto antrópico en el bosque Maulino de Chile|url= |location=Santiago de Chile |publisher=[[Editorial Universitaria]] |pages=153–167 |isbn=9561112841 |language=Spanish|trans-chapter=Floristic structure and human impact on the Maulino forest of Chile}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to geographers [[Humberto Fuenzalida]] and [[Edmundo Pisano]] the forest is one of [[mesophyte]]s on the transition zone of [[temperate rain forests]].&lt;ref name=SanmayDonoso95/&gt;

Large swathes of former Maulino forest were cleared for agriculture.

'''Monte Argentario''' is a ''[[comune]]'' (municipality) and a peninsula belonging to the [[Province of Grosseto]] in the [[Italy|Italian]] region [[Tuscany]], located about {{convert|150|km|mi}} south of [[Florence]] and about {{convert|35|km|mi}} south of [[Grosseto]]. The peninsula is connected with the mainland by three spits of land which form two lagoons, the ''Laguna di Ponente'' on the west side and the ''Laguna di Levante'' on the east side of the middle dam. 
The two main villages on Monte Argentario are [[Porto Santo Stefano]], chief town, facing north, and [[Porto Ercole]] facing south. 

The panoramic road ''Strada panoramica'' starts in Porto Santo Stefano allowing splendid views of the coast and the [[Tuscan Archipelago]].

Monte Argentario borders the ''comune'' of [[Orbetello]], which is located on the middle dam between the two lagoons.

==Geography==
Monte Argentario is a promontory stretching towards the [[Tyrrhenian Sea]] in correspondence of the two southernmost islands of the [[Tuscan Archipelago]], [[Isola del Giglio|Giglio]] and [[Giannutri]]. The promontory was an island in the past, but the sea currents and the [[Albegna]] river joined it with the mainland through two so-called [[Tombolo|tomboli]] (stretches of land), the Tombolo of [[Giannella]] and the Tombolo of the Feniglia.

The highest peak of Monte Argentario is the Punta Telegrafo at {{convert|635|m|ft}} above sea level. The landscape and the coast are mainly rocky, with numerous harbors, usually with rock beaches. The municipal seat is in the northern settlement, [[Porto Santo Stefano]]. The other main settlement in the township is [[Porto Ercole]].

Argentarola cave lies close to Argentario promontory. The high quality [[speleothem]]s that have been collected from this cave have allowed scientists to study the 215,000 year history of sea-level oscillations in this region.&lt;ref name=RRR10410&gt;{{cite journal |author=Caramanna, G |title=Scientific diving for geological research: Examples from Italy |journal=In: Lang, M.A., and M.D.J.

Dauphin Island, AL |publisher=[[American Academy of Underwater Sciences]] |year=2013 |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/10410 |accessdate=2014-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Image:P.S.Stefano panorama.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Porto Santo Stefano.]]
[[Image:Porto Ercole - Vista porto.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Porto Ercole.]]
The promontory, probably already inhabited by the [[Etruscans]], was a personal property of the [[Ahenobarbus|Domitii Ahenobarbi]] family, who obtained it in return for the money they lent to the [[Roman Republic]] in the [[Punic Wars]]. The current name probably finds its origin here, since ''Argentarii'' was the name of money lenders in ancient Rome.

Later an imperial possession, it was ceded to the church by [[Constantine the Great]] in the 4th century AD. In the Middle Ages, due to the reduced traffic passing on the nearby [[Via Aurelia]], the area was sparsely settled. In the heart of the Middle Ages, the promontory became a possession of the Monastery of San Paolo in Rome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Galletti|location=BAV, Cod.Vat.Lat. 7930, fol. 142}}&lt;/ref&gt; It represented in the so-called Carolingian Gate at the Monastery of St. Anastius outside Rome. Following the history of Orbetello, the promontory was a possession of the [[Aldobrandeschi family|Aldobrandeschi]], the [[Orsini family|Orsini]], King [[Ladislaus of Naples]] and [[Siena]], until [[Spain]] acquired it in the late 16th century. The Spaniards heavily fortified the two ports, as the main stronghold of the [[State of Presidi]]. In 1815, after [[Napoleon]]'s defeat, the Argentario was handed over to the [[Grand Duchy of Tuscany]], to which it belonged until 1860, when it became part of the newly united [[Unification of Italy|Kingdom of Italy]].

The painter Michelangelo Merisi, known as [[Caravaggio]], died of a fever at Porto Ercole in 1610.

During [[World War II]], the settlements of Argentario were heavily bombed, with numerous losses. The port of Santo Stefano was destroyed, and was rebuilt only in the 1950s. The railway that connected Orbetello to the mainland was never rebuilt.

{{kml}}

The '''Penguin Islands''' ({{lang-af|Pikkewyn-eilande}}, {{lang-de|Pinguininseln}}) are a [[historical region|historical group]] of mostly scattered islands and rocks situated along a stretch of {{convert|355|km|0|abbr=out}} along the coastline of [[Namibia]]. Not forming a geographic whole, the Namibian government formally lists them as the ''Off-Shore islands''. Their name comes from the presence of [[African penguins]] which inhabit the coastal region surrounding Namibia and [[South Africa]].

==Geography==
The islands are scattered over a long coastal region. Although a few of them form small clusters or groups, such as the islands in [[Lüderitz Bay]], the Penguin Islands lack the mutual proximity of a natural archipelago or island chain. 

The largest island is [[Possession Island (Namibia)|Possession Island]] with {{convert|0.90|km²|2|abbr=out}} in area. Hollam's Bird Island is the most northern and, at a distance of {{convert|10.3|km|1|abbr=out}}, the farthest from the coast. All islands together measure {{convert|2.35|km²|2|abbr=out}} in area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nacoma.org.na/Downloading/MPA_Final-report_15August08.pdf |format=PDF |title=Namibian Islands' Marine Protected Area : WWF South Africa Report Series – 2008/Marine/003 |publisher=Nacoma.org.na |accessdate=22 November 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303204711/http://www.nacoma.org.na/Downloading/MPA_Final-report_15August08.pdf |archivedate=3 March 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Uninhabited, strategically located, rich in [[guano]] deposits and even offshore diamond fields, the islands had considerable value for their size. They were visited by European traders from the 17th century onwards, primarily for the valuable guano.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.namibweb.com/guano.htm |title=The online guide to Namibia: Guano |publisher=NamibWeb.com |date= |accessdate=2015-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1861 and 1867 they were annexed by Britain, and then in 1873 by the [[Cape Colony]]. International confusion over the legality of the transfer required Prime Minister [[John Molteno]] of the Cape Colony to reaffirm the annexation later, with the ''Ichaboe and Penguin Islands Act (1874)''.&lt;ref&gt;Academie de Droit International de La Hague. ''Recueil Des Cours, 1986: Collected Courses of the Hague Academy of International Law''. The Hague: Martinus Nijhoff Publishers, 1988. p.213.&lt;/ref&gt;

The annexation was originally intended to form part of an overall absorption of South West Africa into the Cape Colony forming one locally governed British colony. This was to be instituted by the [[Palgrave Commission]] (1876). 

British interference and the resulting break-down in relations between the British Empire and the local Cape government obstructed the Commission's work long enough for Germany to declare South West Africa a German protectorate in 1884 as part of the continent wide [[Scramble for Africa]]. The offshore islands (and Walvis Bay) were excluded from German administration by their status as Cape constituencies.&lt;ref&gt;John Dugard: ''Namibia-South Africa Treaty on Walvis Bay''. American Society of International Law. ''International Legal Materials'', Vol. 33, No. 6 (NOVEMBER 1994), pp. 1526-1528.&lt;/ref&gt; This status was recognised by Germany in 1886. Thus, although close to the mainland the islands were not part of [[German Southwest Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V1kMAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22edward+hertslet&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=uwmvW7uadj&amp;sig=J7oj2CxvNIJwxATq079XhkgisYI&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=ftiNS8LSF5nENPPR4awN&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CAcQ6AEwADgK#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false |title=The map of Africa by treaty|website=Books.google.com|volume=1|pages=345–46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990 South-West Africa gained independence as Namibia. The Penguin Islands remained under South African sovereignty, thus letting it retain an [[Exclusive Economic Zone]] off the Namibian coast. After further negotiation, at midnight on 28 February 1994 sovereignty over the islands, as well as [[Walvis Bay]], was transferred to Namibia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Klaus Dierks |url=http://www.klausdierks.com/Walvis%20Bay/index.html |title=Namibia's Walvis Bay Issue - Origin and Rise of a Colonial Dispute |publisher=Klausdierks.com |date= |accessdate=2015-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Portuguese Riviera''' ([[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]: ''Riviera Portuguesa'') is the affluent coastal region to the west of [[Lisbon]], [[Portugal]], centered on the coastal cities of [[Cascais]], [[Estoril]], and [[Sintra]].&lt;ref name="BrownBrown2006"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Karen Brown|author2=Clare Brown|author3=June Eveleigh Brown|author4=Cynthia Sauvage|title=Karen Brown's Portugal, 2007: Exceptional Places to Stay &amp; Itineraries|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gCOUF5ec-zYC&amp;pg=PA54|year=2006|publisher=Karen Brown's Guides|isbn=978-1-933810-15-7|pages=54–56}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marinatimes.com/2017/01/the-portuguese-riviera/ Marina Times - The Portuguese Riviera]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://scots2travel.com/2018/07/13/cascais-sintra-pena-palace-portugal/ Scots Travel - Exploring the Portuguese Riviera: Casais &amp; Sintra]&lt;/ref&gt; It is coterminous with the '''Estoril Coast''' (''Costa do Estoril'')&lt;ref name="HoleBeech2005"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Abigail Hole|author2=Charlotte Beech|title=Lonely Planet Portugal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GCPkxTOPKhoC&amp;pg=PA131|year=2005|publisher=Lonely Planet|isbn=978-1-74059-682-4|page=131}}&lt;/ref&gt; and occasionally known as the '''Costa do Sol''' (''Sun Coast'').

Cascais's history as a cosmopolitan center originates in the 1870s, when King [[Luís I of Portugal]] and the [[House of Braganza|Portuguese royal family]] made the seaside town his summer residence, thus attracting members of [[Portuguese nobility|Portugal's aristocracy]], who established a summer community there.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thesun.co.uk/travel/6266801/cascais-lisbon-portugal-travel-resort/ The Sun - Gambling, surfing, strolling… take a break in the stunning resort of Cascais in Portugal]&lt;/ref&gt; During [[World War II]] and the [[Post-war|Post-War period]], the area's royal affiliations intensified, as many heads of European royal houses and deposed monarchs, including King [[Edward VIII of the United Kingdom]], King [[Juan Carlos I of Spain]], and King [[Umberto II of Italy]] made their home in Cascais and Estoril, finding refuge in Portugal's neutrality in the war or from tense political situations in their own countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://us.hellomagazine.com/travel/2014010916432/holiday-like-a-royal-in-cascais/ Hello - Holiday like a Royal in Cascais: A Gem on the Portuguese Riviera]&lt;/ref&gt; Due to its concentration of high-profile personalities, the riviera became a center of [[espionage]] during WWII, inspiring author [[Ian Flemming]] in his creation of the ''[[James Bond]]'' series.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.saveur.com/from-estoril-with-love Saveur - Estoril: The Seaside Portuguese Town that Inspired James Bond]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.realclearlife.com/travel/inside-palacio-estoril-james-bond/ RCL Exclusive - Inside the Palácio Estoril, the Enchanting Hotel That Inspired James Bond]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.publico.pt/2017/02/27/culturaipsilon/noticia/james-bond-teve-uma-vida-real-e-andou-pelo-estoril-onde-nasceu-1763360 Publico - James Bond Teve uma Vida Real e Andou pelo Estoril onde Nasceu]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Origins===
During the third quarter of the 18th century and practically all of the 19th century, foreign travelers and Portuguese aristocrats, inspired by the [[Romanticism|Romanticist]] movement, rediscovered [[Sintra]], a royal retreat during the [[Portuguese Renaissance]], prizing its exotic landscapes and climate. In the summer of 1787, [[William Thomas Beckford|William Beckford]] stayed with the Marquis of Marialva, [[master of the horse]] for the kingdom, at his residence of [[Seteais Palace]]. At the beginning of the 19th century Princess Carlota Joaquina, wife of the Regent [[John VI of Portugal|John]], bought the estate and [[Ramalhão Palace]]. Between 1791 and 1793, Gerard Devisme constructed a Neo-Gothic mansion on his extensive estate in the Quinta de Monserrate (later known as the [[Monserrate Palace]]). Beckford, who remained in Sintra, rented the property from Devisme in 1794. The landscape, covered in fog, also attracted another Englishman, [[Sir Francis Cook, 1st Baronet|Francis Cook]], who occupied the estate, constructing an oriental pavilion.&lt;ref name="CMHistoria"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cm-sintra.pt/Artigo.aspx?ID=3383 |location=Sintra, Portugal |publisher=Câmara Municipal de Sintra |language=Portuguese |title=Sintra e a sua Historia |year=2011 |accessdate=10 October 2011 |editor=Câmara Municipal}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Pena National Palace|Palace of Pena]], Sintra's exemplary Portuguese Romantic symbol, was initiated by the King-Consort [[Ferdinand II of Portugal|Ferdinand]], husband of Queen [[Maria II of Portugal]].

===19th century===
In 1854, the first contract was signed to construct a rail link between Sintra and Lisbon. A decree signed on 26 June 1855 regulated the contract between the government and Count Claranges Lucotte but was later rescinded in 1861. The connection was finally inaugurated on 2 April 1887.

The Portuguese Riviera originated when King [[Luís I of Portugal]] ordered a [[Cascais Citadel Palace Museum|royal residence]] to be constructed in Cascais Citadel, starting the tradition of Cascais being the [[House of Braganza|Portuguese royal family]]'s Summer residence, which lasted from 1870 to 1908, transforming the seaside village into a cosmopolitan address. Thanks to King Luís I, the citadel was equipped with the country's first electric lights in 1878. Cascais also benefited with the construction of better roads to Lisbon and Sintra, a casino, a bullfight ring, a sports club, and improvements to basic infrastructure for the population. Many noble families built [[Summer architecture|impressive mansions]] still to be seen in the town centre and environs. The first railway arrived in 1889.
[[File:Publicidade Estoril antiga.jpg|thumb|left|An advertisement for [[Estoril]] and its amenities; first half of the 20th century.]]

In 1896, King [[Carlos I of Portugal]], a lover of all maritime activities, installed in Cascais Citadel the first oceanographic laboratory in Portugal. The King himself led a total of 12 scientific expeditions to the coast; these ended in 1908 with his assassination in Lisbon.

From the second half of the 19th century into the first decades of the 20th century, Sintra also became a privileged place for artists: musicians such as [[José Vianna da Motta]]; composers such as [[Alfredo Keil]], painters like [[João Cristino da Silva]] (author of one of the most celebrated canvases of Portuguese Romantic art, ''"Cinco Artistas em Sintra"''), writers such as [[José Maria de Eça de Queirós|Eça de Queirós]] or [[Ramalho Ortigão]], all these people lived, worked or got inspiration from Sintra's landscapes.&lt;ref name=CMHistoria/&gt;

By the beginning of the 20th century, Sintra was recognized as a summer resort visited by aristocrats and millionaires. Among these, Carvalho Monteiro, owner of a considerable fortune (known as ''"Monteiro dos Milhões"'') constructed near the main town on an estate he bought from the Baroness of Regaleira, the [[Quinta da Regaleira]], regarded as a prime example of [[Neo-Manueline]] architecture.

===World War II===
During the [[Second World War]], the region was the centre of spies and diplomatic secrecy, situations that provided the region with a cosmopolitan atmosphere and sophistication.&lt;ref name="JFHistoria"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jf-estoril.pt/docs/Conteudos.asp?idConteudo=61&amp;Lingua=Por |title=História |editor=Junta Freguesia |publisher=Junta Freguesia de Estoril |location=Estoril (Cascais), Portugal |accessdate=8 February 2012 |year=2011 |language=Portuguese |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007133637/http://www.jf-estoril.pt/docs/Conteudos.asp?idConteudo=61&amp;Lingua=Por |archivedate=7 October 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the vision of Fausto Cardoso de Figueiredo and his business partner Augusto Carreira de Sousa, it became an international tourist destination both during and after the Second World War.&lt;ref name=JFHistoria/&gt;

In July 1940, [[Edward VIII|Edward, Duke of Windsor]] (former Edward VIII of the United Kingdom) and his wife, [[Wallis Simpson]], moved to [[Estoril]], where they lived at first in the home of [[Banco Espírito Santo|Ricardo de Espírito Santo]], a Portuguese banker with both British and German contacts.&lt;ref&gt;Bloch, p. 91&lt;/ref&gt;

During that time, several dignitaries and [[exile]]s came to Estoril: [[Miklós Horthy]], the regent of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] (lived and died in exile after the Second World War); the [[Infante Juan, Count of Barcelona]] (father of [[Juan Carlos I of Spain]]) and the King resided in the territory, as did [[Umberto II of Italy]] and [[Carol II of Romania]].&lt;ref name=JFHistoria/&gt;

It was also in this location that former Portuguese dictator [[António de Oliveira Salazar]] had a summer house. It was Salazar who ordered the construction of the E.N.6 motorway, more commonly referred to as the ''Avenida Marginal'', in order for him to quickly travel by car between Cascais and Lisbon (until then the accessway was nothing more than a dirt road, where traffic could only circulate at low velocities and make frequent stops).&lt;ref name=JFHistoria/&gt; The roadway permitted the dictator to travel rapidly, and with fewer stops, it wasn't possible for him to be recognized easily in transit.&lt;ref name=JFHistoria/&gt;
[[File:Linha de Cascais DSC 0241 (17296423451).jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Casino Estoril]], with its gardens facing the [[Atlantic Ocean]] is Europe's largest [[casino]].]]
Complimenting the [[jet-set]] community that prospered in the region, [[Casino Estoril]], Europe's largest casino, was founded in 1958.

===Today===
Today the towns of the Portuguese Riviera continue to host the Portuguese elite and be a vacation destination for international tourists. The Riviera plays an important part in [[tourism in Portugal]]. A large expatriate community continues to exist, primarily in Cascais and Sintra, leading to the majority of Lisbon's international schools being located within the area (with [[Carlucci American International School of Lisbon|Carlucci American International School]] in Sintra, [[St Julian's School]] and [[Saint Dominic's International School|St Dominic's School]] in Cascais, and [[Oeiras International School]]). Luxury [[gated communities]] have greatly developed in the region in the late 20th and early 21st century, including [[Quinta da Beloura]], [[Quinta da Marinha]], [[Quinta da Penha Longa]], and [[Quinta Patino]].

Since the middle of the 20th century, the region has come to play host to numerous international sports and entertainment festivals, such as the [[Lisbon &amp; Estoril Film Festival]] (in Estoril), the [[4 Hours of Estoril]] endurance race (in Cascais), and [[NOS Alive]] music festival (in [[Algés (Oeiras)|Algés]]). The [[Cascais Marina]] has hosted many important events, including the [[America's Cup World Series]].

[[File:Front of the Hotel Palacio in Estoril.JPG|thumb|The Hotel Palácio Estoril is one of [[Estoril]]'s most recognizable landmarks.]]
===Climate===
The region has a [[Mediterranean climate]], influenced by the Atlantic and characterized by moderate temperatures and wet winters. Although the climate in the area of [[Cabo da Roca]] is [[semi-arid]], the Sintra Mountains are considered moderately humid: precipitation in the mountains is higher than in the surrounding areas.

'''Roman Tmetuchl International Airport''' {{Airport codes|ROR|PTRO|ROR&lt;ref name="FAA" /&gt;}}, also known as '''Palau International Airport''' is the main airport of [[Palau]]. It is located near the former capital [[Koror_City|Koror]], just north of [[Ngetkib]], [[Airai]] on [[Babelthuap]] (Babeldaob) island. The airport is 4 miles (6&amp;nbsp;km) from [[Koror_City|Koror]] and 15 miles (25&amp;nbsp;km) from [[Ngerulmud]].

==Overview==
[[File:Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko 20150408.jpg|thumb|left|200ox|[[Emperor Akihito]] and [[Empress Michiko]] (8 April 2015)]]
The airport covers an area of {{convert|480|acre|ha|lk=on}} at an [[elevation]] of 176 feet (54 m) above [[mean sea level]]. It has one [[runway]] designated 9/27 with an [[asphalt]] and [[concrete]] surface measuring 7,200 by 150 feet (2,194 x 45 m).&lt;ref name="FAA" /&gt; For the 12-month period ending December 13, 2004, the airport had 1,142 aircraft operations, an average of 95 per month: 78% [[airline|scheduled commercial]], 10% [[air taxi]], 8% [[general aviation]] and 4% [[military aviation|military]].&lt;ref name="FAA" /&gt;

== History ==
A resolution adopted by the [[Senate of Palau]] in May 2006 renamed ''Palau International Airport'' as the ''Roman Tmetuchl International Airport'', in honor of the late local politician and businessman [[Roman Tmetuchl]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.palauoek.net/senate/legislation/sjr/SenateJointResolutionsTable.pdf|archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20080410090632/http://www.palauoek.net/senate/legislation/sjr/SenateJointResolutionsTable.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2008-04-10|title=Senate Joint Resolution Status Table|date=2007-11-02|accessdate=2008-02-25|publisher=Senate of Palau|first=Florencia|last=Ngiraiwet|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also known as ''Babelthuap/Koror Airport''&lt;ref name="FAA" /&gt; or ''Airai Airport''.

[[Delta Air Lines]] provided scheduled service to [[Narita International Airport|Tokyo-Narita]] until 2018. Following Delta's withdrawal from the Palau market, [[Skymark Airlines]] announced that it would start charter service from Narita to Palau, and upgrade these flights to scheduled service in mid-2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Companies/Skymark-to-offer-Tokyo-service-to-Saipan-and-Palau|title=Skymark to offer Tokyo service to Saipan and Palau|website=Nikkei Asian Review|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sousa''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|uː|z|ə}}, {{IPA-pt|ˈso(w)zɐ|lang}}), '''Souza''', '''de Sousa''' (literally, ''from Sousa''), or '''de Souza''' is a common [[Portuguese language|Portuguese-language]] surname, especially in [[Portugal]], [[Brazil]], [[East Timor]], [[India]] (among Catholics in [[Goa]], [[Bombay]], and [[Mangalore]]), and [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]].&lt;ref&gt;http://ilg.usc.es/cag/Controlador_ing?busca=sousa&lt;/ref&gt;
In Africa, the name is common among people with Portuguese and Brazilian roots in [[Ghana]], [[Togo]], [[Benin]], [[Nigeria]], [[Angola]], [[São Tomé and Príncipe]], [[Cape Verde]], [[Guinea-Bissau]], and [[Mozambique]]. 
{{TOC_right}}

==Etymology and history==
The name was originally a [[toponym]], the [[Sousa River]] Northern Portugal. Sometimes the spelling is in the archaic form '''Souza''' or '''de Souza''', which has occasionally been changed to '''D'Souza'''. The Spanish equivalent of this surname is [[Sosa (surname)|Sosa]].

During the colonial era, the Portuguese built forts along Brazilian and West African coastal areas for trade, many of which were later used for the slave trade. They also had children with local women, and the children were given their fathers' last names.

Some Afro-Brazilians who returned to Africa also carry this last name. Among those are the [[Tabom people]], descendants of [[Francisco Félix de Sousa]], a white Portuguese-Brazilian man from Salvador, Bahia, in Brazil, once the richest man in West Africa due to his involvement in its slave trade.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

[[Image:Big Spring Missouri 1-02Aug08.jpg|thumb|right|On an average day nearly {{convert|303|e6USgal|m3}} of water flow from [[Big Spring (Missouri)|Big Spring]] in [[Missouri]] at a rate of {{convert|469|cuft/s|m3/s}}.]]

A '''spring ''' is a point at which water flows from an [[aquifer]] to the Earth's surface. It is a component of the [[hydrosphere]].

== Formation ==
[[Image:Nacentemackinac.jpg|thumb|upright|A natural spring on [[Mackinac Island]] in [[Michigan]]]]

A spring may be the result of [[karst topography]] where surface water has infiltrated the [[Earth]]'s surface (recharge area), becoming part of the area [[groundwater]]. The groundwater then travels through a network of cracks and fissure—openings ranging from intergranular spaces to large [[cave|caves]]. The water eventually emerges from below the surface, in the form of a [[karst spring]].

The forcing of the spring to the surface can be the result of a confined [[aquifer]] in which the recharge area of the spring water table rests at a higher elevation than that of the outlet. Spring water forced to the surface by elevated sources are [[Artesian aquifer|artesian wells]]. This is possible even if the outlet is in the form of a {{convert|300|ft|m|adj=mid|-deep}} cave. In this case the cave is used like a hose by the higher elevated recharge area of groundwater to exit through the lower elevation opening.

Non-artesian springs may simply flow from a higher elevation through the earth to a lower elevation and exit in the form of a spring, using the ground like a drainage pipe.

Still other springs are the result of pressure from an underground source in the earth, in the form of [[volcanic]] activity. The result can be water at elevated temperature such as a [[hot spring]].

[[Image:MiddleSpring.JPG|thumb|Sunrise at Middle Spring, [[Fish Springs National Wildlife Refuge]], Utah]]
The action of the groundwater continually dissolves permeable bedrock such as [[limestone]] and [[dolomite]], creating vast cave systems.&lt;ref name=USGS&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ga.water.usgs.gov/edu/watercyclesprings.html|title=Springs - The Water Cycle, from USGS Water-Science School|website=ga.water.usgs.gov|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090509022203/http://ga.water.usgs.gov/edu/watercyclesprings.html|archivedate=9 May 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Types ===
* [[Seep (hydrology)|Seepage]] or filtration spring. The term seep refers to springs with small flow rates in which the source water has filtered through permeable earth.
* Fracture springs, discharge from faults, joints, or fissures in the earth, in which springs have followed a natural course of voids or weaknesses in the bedrock.
* Tubular springs, in which the water flows from underground caverns.

== Flow ==
Spring discharge, or '''resurgence''', is determined by the spring's recharge basin. Factors that affect the recharge include the size of the area in which groundwater is captured, the amount of precipitation, the size of capture points, and the size of the spring outlet.  Water may leak into the underground system from many sources including permeable earth, sinkholes, and [[losing stream]]s.  In some cases entire [[Stream|creek]]s seemingly disappear as the water sinks into the ground via the stream bed. [[Grand Gulf State Park (Missouri)|Grand Gulf State Park]] in [[Missouri]] is an example of an entire creek vanishing into the groundwater system.  The water emerges {{convert|9|mi|km}} away, forming some of the discharge of [[Mammoth Spring]] in [[Arkansas]]. Human activity may also affect a spring's discharge—withdrawal of groundwater reduces the water pressure in an aquifer, decreasing the volume of flow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://waterdata.usgs.gov/mo/nwis/sw|title=USGS Surface-Water Data for Missouri|website=waterdata.usgs.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Classification ===
[[Image:La Sorgue, Fontaine-de-Vaucluse.JPG|thumb|[[Fontaine de Vaucluse (spring)|Fontaine de Vaucluse]] or Spring of Vaucluse in France discharges about {{convert|470|e6USgal|m3}} of water per day at a rate of 727 cubic feet (21 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) per second.]]
Springs are often classified by the volume of the water they discharge. The largest springs are called "first-magnitude", defined as springs that discharge water at a rate of at least 2800 liters or {{convert|100|cuft|m3}} of water per second.  Some locations contain many first-magnitude springs, such as [[Florida]] where there are at least 27 known to be that size; the [[Missouri]] and [[Arkansas]] [[Ozarks]], which contain 10&lt;ref&gt;Vineyard and Fender, 1982. p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://waterdata.usgs.gov/mo/nwis/sw|title=USGS Surface-Water Data for Missouri|website=waterdata.usgs.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;  known of first-magnitude; and 11&lt;ref name=ui&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.if.uidaho.edu/~johnson/ifiwrri/1000spgs.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-05-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121212171529/http://www.if.uidaho.edu/~johnson/ifiwrri/1000spgs.html |archivedate=12 December 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; more in the [[Thousand Springs State Park|Thousand Springs]] area along the [[Snake River]] in [[Idaho]].

==Water content==
{{Main|Mineral spring}}
[[File:PruessLake.JPG|thumb|[[Pruess Lake]] is spring-fed in the arid [[Snake Valley (Great Basin)|Snake Valley]] of [[Utah]].]]
[[Mineral]]s become dissolved in the water as it moves through the underground [[rock (geology)|rocks]]. This may give the water flavor and even [[carbon dioxide]] bubbles, depending on the nature of the [[geology]] through which it passes. This is why spring water is often bottled and sold as [[mineral water]], although the term is often the subject of [[deception|deceptive]] [[advertising]]. Springs that contain significant amounts of minerals are sometimes called '[[mineral springs]]'. (Springs without such mineral content, meanwhile, are sometimes distinguished as 'sweet springs'.) Springs that contain large amounts of dissolved [[sodium]] [[salts]], mostly [[sodium carbonate]], are called 'soda springs'.  Many resorts have developed around mineral springs and are known as [[spa towns]].

Water from springs is usually clear. However some springs may be colored by the minerals that are dissolved in the water. For instance, water heavy with iron or [[tannins]] will have an orange color.&lt;ref name="USGS"/&gt; 

In parts of the United States a [[stream]] carrying the outflow of a spring to a nearby primary stream may be called a '''spring branch''' or run.  Groundwater tends to maintain a relatively long-term average temperature of its aquifer; so flow from a spring may be cooler than a summer day, but remain unfrozen in the winter.  The cool water of a spring and its branch may harbor species such as certain [[trout]] that are otherwise ill-suited to a warmer local [[climate]].

== Uses ==
[[Image:Maramec Spring fishing ls.jpg|thumb|[[Trout fishing]] on [[Maramec Spring]] in [[Missouri]]]]
{{Expand section|date=October 2010}}
Springs have been used for a variety of human needs including drinking water, domestic water supply, irrigation, [[Watermill|mill]]s, navigation, and [[hydroelectricity|electricity generation]].  Other modern uses include recreational activities such as fishing, swimming, and floating; [[hot springs|therapy]]; water for livestock; fish hatcheries; and supply for bottled [[mineral water]].

=== Sacred springs ===
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2018}}
{{main article|Holy well}}
A sacred spring, or holy well, is a small body of water emerging from underground and revered either in a [[Christian]], [[Paganism|pagan]] or other religious context, sometimes both.{{cn|date=February 2016}} The lore and mythology of [[ancient Greece]] was replete with sacred and storied springs—notably, the [[Corycian nymphs|Corycian]], [[Pierian Spring|Pierian]] and [[Castalian Spring|Castalian]]. In medieval Europe, holy wells were frequently pagan sacred sites that later became [[Christianization|Christianized]]. The term "holy well" is commonly employed to refer to any water source of limited size (i.e. not a lake or river, but including pools and natural springs and seeps), which has some significance in local [[folklore]]. This can take the form of a particular name, an associated [[legend]], the attribution of healing qualities to the water through the [[numen|numinous]] presence of its guardian spirit or Christian saint, or a ceremony or ritual centred on the well site. In Christian legend, the spring water is often said to have been made to flow by the action of a saint, a familiar theme especially in the [[hagiography]] of Celtic saints.

The '''urban area of [[Copenhagen]]'''  ({{lang-da|Storkøbenhavn}} or {{lang|da|Hovedstadsområdet}}), lying mostly in the [[Capital Region of Denmark]] but also in [[Region Zealand]], consist of [[Copenhagen]] and [[Frederiksberg]] municipalities and the former [[Copenhagen County]], except for the municipalities [[Høje-Taastrup]] and [[Ledøje-Smørum]]. In all, it consists of 18 municipalities, and except parts of [[Ballerup]], [[Greve Municipality|Greve]] (of former [[Roskilde County]]), [[Ishøj]], former [[Søllerød]] and former [[Værløse Municipality|Værløse]], mentioned with (the part of) their population included from 2007. Ishøj and Greve Strand are included for the first time since 1999.  As of 1 January 2016, this area had a population of 1,280,371.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://statistikbanken.dk/statbank5a/default.asp?w=768|title=Statistics Denmark: Copenhagen City/Urban Area (Københavns Kommune, Hovedstadsområdet), 2012 (tables: FOLK1, BEF44) |publisher=Statistics Denmark|accessdate=31 May 2012|archiveurl=http://statistikbanken.dk/statbank5a/default.asp?w=768|archivedate=2012-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Statistics Denmark states that the definition of the urban area is based on UN's 200m definition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dst.dk/da/Statistik/dokumentation/Varedeklarationer/emnegruppe/emne.aspx?sysrid=766 1.2 Statistiske begreber] {{da icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==List of municipalities==
According to [[Danmarks Statistik]], since January 1, 2007 '''Hovedstadsområdet''' (English: ''the Capital area'') comprises the following municipalities ({{lang-da|[[Commune (subnational entity)|kommune]]}}) (population, as of 01Jan 2018, mentioned if only ''part'' of the municipality belongs to the urban area) :

* [[Copenhagen Municipality|Copenhagen]] (a large area of western Amager is unpopulated) - 613,288
* [[Frederiksberg]] - 104,410
* [[Albertslund Municipality|Albertslund]] - 27,743
* [[Ballerup Municipality|Ballerup ]] - 48,295

* [[Tårnby Municipality|Tårnby]] (a very large area of western Amager and the Saltholm and Peberholm islands are unpopulated) - 43,063
* [[Vallensbæk Municipality|Vallensbæk]] - 16,280

==Hovedstadsområdet vs. urban area of Copenhagen==
However '''Hovedstadsområdet''' ({{lang-en|"The Capital Area"}}) isn't a definition for the urban area of Copenhagen. The area doesn't follow the recommendations of the [[United Nations]] regarding urban definitions (i.e. 200 meters between buildings as the required minimum) and is used for statistic issues only. The main difference between "Hovedstadsområdet" and
common urban area definition (or ''city limits'') involves the islands of [[Amager]], Saltholm and Peberholm, and primarily the municipality of [[Tårnby]].

[[File:AMAGER ISLAND.JPG|thumb|Amager island land use]]

"Hovedstadsområdet" contains the entire Copenhagen and Tårnby municipalities, although the latter contains large areas without buildings and inhabitants. This also applies to a smaller part of Copenhagen on Amager island.

The western part of Amager is an enlargement from a shallow part of the [[Øresund]] sea, gained from the sea during the 1930s to 1950s. This extended part of Amager is split between Copenhagen and Tårnby municipalities, and is only built-up on two minor areas. It also includes along the harbour and around [[Bella Center]] (which hosted the climate meeting [[COP 15]] in December 2009). Apart from these smaller areas and an allotment-garden cottage area, the vast majority of western Amager is unplanned, with few buildings (like a shooting range). The cause for this creation was mainly to give shelter to the southern part of Copenhagen harbour. Since the area is now filled out with big stones, sand from the sea, plaster, wastes and unknown items, building in the area is expensive. Not even agriculture is possible due to bad soil. (However the southern part of Amager has agricultural areas and even a small forest, "Kongelunden" ("''King Grove''"). These areas belong to a third municipality of Amager island, [[Dragør]].)

Some of the unused area belongs to Copenhagen municipality, but the Tårnby municipality part is far larger. Also the almost unpopulated islands of "Saltholm" (3 inhabitants in 2010) and "Peberholm" (unpopulated) belongs to Tårnby, and so does the taxi and runway system of Copenhagen Airport (with three long runways). In all, most of Tårnby and a minor part of Copenhagen municipalities on Amager island cannot be regarded as an urban area. Consequently, "Hovedstadsområdet" does not equal an ''urban area of Copenhagen''.

Neither the Danish statistic authority "Danmarks Statistik" (which presents information regarding "Hovedstadsområdet") or the Danish geographical institute "Kort og Matrikelstyrelsen" (which determines the borders of "Hovedstadsområdet") states that "Hovedstadsområdet" is an urban area of Copenhagen. For internal Danish matters this is of no importance. But when comparing Copenhagen with other cities, the unpopulated non-urban areas of Amager, Saltholm and Peberholm do make a difference in f.i. terms of [[population density]].

{{As of|2012|02}}, Copenhagen lacks official urban borders (or [[city limits]]) for comparison with other cities. "Hovedstadsområdet" is an area invented primarily for statistical matters. It's rarely used in conversation (as a ''defined'' area). Sometimes in media the word "Hovedstadsområdet" represents a metropolitan area from [[Køge]] in the south to [[Elsinore]] in the north and [[Roskilde]] in the west. For instance, a regional television channel called "Hovedstads-TV" covers this larger area. But even in nationwide public service television news, the word "Hovedstadsområdet" may refer to either what the Danish statistic institute defines as "Hovedstadsområdet" or the metropolitan area.

An other similar area is "Storkøbenhavn" (eng. "Greater Copenhagen"). This is used by "Vejdirektoratet" ("the road authority") only. Just "Copenhagen" may refer either to the municipality, which has quite stingy borders (and totally surrounds Frederiksberg municipality), or the entire city, which doesn't have defined borders.

Until the 1970s, the city region of Copenhagen ({{lang-da|København}}) was stated as the three municipalities [[Copenhagen]], [[Frederiksberg]] and [[Gentofte]]. A better description of the city core (excluding all suburbs) would be south of the [[Dyrehaven]] forest in the north, the area east of the motorway called "motorring 3" and north of the motorway across Amager island which continues towards Sweden. This area includes Copenhagen (with Frederiksberg), Gentofte, most of [[Gladsaxe]], [[Rødovre]], [[Hvidovre]] and a part of [[Tårnby]] municipalities&lt;ref&gt;google maps earth mode&lt;/ref&gt; This area has around 900.000 to 950.000 inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;tally of population of the mentioned municipalities, including some reductions for the parts outside the described area&lt;/ref&gt;

Urban Copenhagen and this city region are statistical abstracts only and have no political and/or administrative implications.

The '''Valdivia Expedition''', or ''Deutschen Tiefsee-Expedition'' (German Deep Sea Expedition), was a scientific expedition organised and funded by the [[German Empire]] under [[Kaiser Wilhelm II]] and was named after the ship which was bought and outfitted for the expedition, the [[SS Valdivia]]. It was led by the marine biologist [[Carl Chun]] and the expedition ran from 1898-1899 with the purpose of exploring the depths of the oceans below 500 fathoms, which had not been explored by the earlier [[Challenger Expedition]].

The Challenger Expedition was the expedition that established modern Oceanography, prompting many other expeditions which were either nationally and privately funded which would dredge the deep-sea in search of new and exotic species. This late 19th Century fascination with organisms found at great depths was unsurprising, because in the mid-19th century most scientists followed Abyssal Theory which stated that it was not possible for life to exist below 300 fathoms depth. [[Carl Chun]], a famed [[teuthology|teuthologist]], held had a deep conviction that there must be life, in abundance, which existed in the unknown abyssal regions of the oceans, a belief he shared with an increasingly large number of marine scientists.  This conviction along with his desire to further explore the areas of the oceans which were not covered by the Challenger Expedition that led him to propose that the German Empire organise its own expedition which was to be nationally funded with the approval of the Kaiser.

[[File:Carl chun.jpg|Carl Chun|thumb]]

==Conception and preparation==
Chun proposed to the ''[[Gesellschaft Deutscher Naturforscher und Ärzte]]'' (Society of German Naturalists and Doctors ), which was the German equivalent of the [[Royal Society]], that a German deep sea expedition be funded and equipped to explore the deep oceans. His proposal was well received and a resolution to approve the plan and recommend it to the German government was unanimously adopted on 24 September 1897. It was originally conceived as purely zoological expedition but [[Friedrich Ratzel]] suggested that chemical and physical observations be included in the expedition's remit and this was accepted. The German government approved the proposal and granted the expedition 300,000 marks in initial funding with promises of further grants to cover the expenses of the expedition and the publication costs of its findings.&lt;ref name = GJ&gt;{{cite article | title = The German Deep-Sea Expedition | year = 1898 | journal = The Geographical Journal | volume = 12 | issue = 5 | pages = 494-496}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ship, the ''[[SS Valdivia]]'', was chartered from the ''[[Hamburg America Line|Hamburg-Amerikanischen Packetfahrt-Actien-Gesellschaft]]'' (HAPAG), which fitted the ship out with equipment such as dredging gear, specimen jars, deep sea traps and oceanographic equipment,  also outfitting the laboratories, while also providing the crew and provisions, all for a sum equivalent to £17,000, a sum which covered the company's expenses but did not allow for any profit.&lt;ref name = SGM&gt;{{cite article | journal = Scottish Geographical Magazine | volume = 16 | issue = 7| pages = 416-418 | title = The German deep sea expedition on the ship “Valdivia” | year = 1900}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chun was the overall leader of the expedition.&lt;ref name = Mills/&gt; A captain of whaling ships, Adalbert Krech, was appointed the ship's captain while the navigator was a Herr Sachse who was an employee of HAPAG's. The scientific staff was made up of the botanist Professor [[Andreas Franz Wilhelm Schimper|W. Schimper]] of [[Bonn]], the zoologists [[Carl Apstein]], [[Ernst Vanhöffen]] and Fritz Braem, the oceanographer Gerhardt Schott, the chemist Paul Schmidt and Dr M. Bathman who was a bacteriologist and the ship's doctor, who died on the voyage. [[August Brauer]] and [[Otto zur Strassen]] who were zoologists by profession and Fritz Winter who was an artist and photographer, but these had no official status recorded.&lt;ref name = SGM/&gt;

[[File:Adalbert Krech 1898.jpg|thumb|left|Adalbert Krech 1898]]

==The Voyage==
[[File:Route Valdivia.png|thumb|Map of the route taken by the Valdivia Expedition]]
The ''Valdivia'' set sail from [[Hamburg]] on 1 August 1898&lt;ref name = SGM/&gt; and made its first call into the harbour of [[Granton, Edinburgh]], where the scientists visited the offices of ''The Challenger'' Expedition Commission and were entertained by [[John Murray (oceanographer)|Sir John Murray]].&lt;ref name = SGM/&gt; The expedition then sailed north, entering the Atlantic between the [[Faroe Islands]] and the [[Shetland Islands]] and then turning south towards the [[Canary Islands]] and the west coast of Africa, reaching [[Cape Town]] on the 26th August.&lt;ref name = SGM/&gt; They then explored a major part of the Indian Ocean and the Antarctic Ocean, covering a total of 32,000 nautical miles.&lt;ref name = BHL&gt;{{cite web | url = http://blog.biodiversitylibrary.org/2012/06/book-of-week-valdivia-expedition.html | title = Book of the Week: The Vadivia Expedition Deep sea dredging in the twilight zone with Teuthologist Carl Chun | accessdate = 3 April 2017 | publisher = [[Biodiversity Heritage Library]] | author = Jacqueline Ford | year = 2012 | work = Notes and News from BHL Staff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Valdivia'' was among the Antarctic ice for almost four weeks in November and December 1898 in the sea between [[Bouvet Island]], which was rediscovered by the expedition, and [[Enderby Land]]. During this time the crew observed around 180 icebergs many of which they sketched and photographed, however as the ''Valdivia'' was an ordinary steel hulled vessel the ship had to remain clear of the [[pack ice]].&lt;ref name = NOAA&gt;{{cite web | url = http://celebrating200years.noaa.gov/rarebooks/valdivia/welcome.html | title = Aus den Tiefen des Weltmeeres: Schilderungen von der Deutschen Tieffee-Expedition - From the Depths of the World Sea: Descriptions of the German Deep Sea Expedition) | accessdate = 3 April 2017 | publisher = NOAA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Mills&gt;{{cite book | author = William J. Mills | title = Exploring Polar Frontiers: A Historical Encyclopedia, Volume 1 | pages = 147–148 | chapter = Chun, Carl | year = 2003 | publisher = ABC-CLIO | isbn = 1576074226}}&lt;/ref&gt; As well as the biological, geological and geographic findings the expedition was also able to make significant meteorological observations.&lt;ref name = Mills/&gt;

The ''Valdivia'' returned to Hamburg on 30 April 1899.&lt;ref name = Mills/&gt;

==Publication of results==
The main aims of the expedition were to collect as many biological specimens as they could while focussing on how organisms adapted to the extreme conditions of the environment of the deep oceans. One result of this was that a number anatomical studies of light organs were carried out. One of the best known publications is ''Volume 15: Die Tiefsee-Fische'' by Brauer which has an editorial review by Chun consisting of a systematic and anatomical study of the deep sea fish specimens they collected on their voyage aboard the ''Valvidia'' which were illustrated by [[Friedrich Wilhelm Winter]]. Winter's illustrations make it clear that these deep sea fish are heavily reliant on senses other than their vision. Many are [[Bioluminescence|bioluminescent]] and in numbers these animals have the effect of making the deep, dark sea look like a night sky filled with stars.&lt;ref name = BHL/&gt;

The expeditions findings took 4 decades to be published, and they were published in 24 volumes as ''Wissenschaftliche Ergebnisse der Deutschen Tiefsee-Expedition auf dem Dampfer "Valdivia" 1898-1899'' (Scientific results of the German deep-sea expedition on the steamer "Valdivia" 1898-1899). Another much admired volume is Chun's own ''Die Cephalopoden'' in which Chun describes the [[vampire squid]] ''Vampyroteuthis infernalis'' the scientific name meaning "the vampire squid from hell".&lt;ref name = BHL/&gt; The type specimen was collected on the expedition.&lt;ref name = Wood&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.thecephalopodpage.org/vsfh.php | title = Introducing ''Vampyroteuthis infernalis'', the vampire squid from Hell | accessdate = 3 April 2017 | publisher =  Dr. James B.

'''Ørestad''' ({{IPA-da|ˈøːɐsdað}}) is a developing city area in [[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]], on the island of [[Amager]]. When the area was planned it was expected that 20,000 people would live in Ørestad, 20,000 would study, and 80,000 people would be employed in the area. However, so far the area has failed to attract even half of those numbers.&lt;ref name="tandfonline.com"&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09654313.2015.1014780|title=Urban Megaprojects in Crisis? Ørestad Copenhagen Revisited|first=Stan|last=Majoor|date=2 December 2015|publisher=|volume=23|issue=12|pages=2497–2515|via=Taylor and Francis+NEJM|doi=10.1080/09654313.2015.1014780}}&lt;/ref&gt; The area is being developed using the [[new town]] concept with the [[Copenhagen Metro]] as the primary [[public transport]] grid, connecting the area with the rest of [[Metropolitan Copenhagen]].

Ørestad is noted for its attractive location and excellent infrastructure, which apart from the metro includes the [[Oresund Railway]] and [[Copenhagen Airport]], as well as the nearby [[Øresund Bridge]]. The regional [[Oresundtrain]]s reach Copenhagen Airport in six minutes, [[Copenhagen Central Station]] in seven, and 29 minutes to [[Malmö Central Station|Central Station]] in [[Malmö]], Sweden's third largest  city. Ørestad has once been referred to as "the largest crossroad in Scandinavia".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.building-supply.dk/article/view.html?id=20856|title=Første spadestik til milliardbyggeri i Ørestad Syd|publisher=Building Supply|accessdate=2009-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Ørestad has also been criticized heavily for its modernist planning approach, focusing exclusively on real estate development and infrastructure connections. This has resulted in wide, open spaces that are void of any human life. The plans for the area have been remade several times to account for such mistakes, but so far without much success.&lt;ref name="tandfonline.com"/&gt;

Ørestad is divided into four districts: Ørestad Nord, Amager Fælled kvarteret, Ørestad City and Ørestad Syd. Among the most notable institutions located in Ørestad are the [[DR Byen|DR Village]], the headquarters of the national Danish broadcaster [[DR (broadcaster)|DR]], [[Copenhagen Concert Hall]] designed by [[Jean Nouvel]], [[Field's]], the largest [[shopping mall]] in Denmark, and [[Bella Center]], the largest [[convention center|exhibition and conference center]] in Scandinavia, with [[Bella Sky Hotel]], the largest hotel in Scandinavia.

==Geography==
The area of Ørestad is {{convert|3.1|km2|1|abbr=off}}, being about {{convert|600|m|ft|abbr=off}} wide and {{convert|5|km|abbr=off}} long. The central part of Ørestad, Ørestad City, is located {{convert|4.5|km|1|abbr=on}} west of Copenhagen Airport Kastrup and {{convert|5|km|0|abbr=on}} south of Copenhagen city centre.

Ørestad borders [[Islands Brygge]] to the north, [[Tårnby]] to the east, and the extensive [[Kalvebod Fælled|Kalvebod Commons]] to the west.

==History==

}}
The legislation regarding Ørestad was enacted in 1992 because the unused areas were regarded as being too valuable. [[Ørestad Development Corporation]] (Ørestadsselskabet I/S) was founded March 11, 1993 to manage the growth of the city district. The corporation is owned 55% by [[Copenhagen|Copenhagen municipality]] and 45% by the [[Ministry of Finance of Denmark|Ministry of Finance]]. The development is expected to take 20 to 30 years at a cost of about €175 million, and it is expected that 20,000 people will live in Ørestad, 20,000 will study, and 80,000 people will be employed in the area.

At the beginning of 2008, 53% of the area had been sold.

The winning project of an international architectural competition held in 1994 revealed an overall masterplan for Ørestad, dividing the area into four districts. The Finnish design office APRT and Danish [[KHR Arkitekter]] established a joint-venture and presented a final plan in 1997.

The first office building was completed in 2001. The first residential buildings were completed three years later. Currently, there are more than 3000 flats as well as {{convert|192,100|m²|0|abbr=on}} of office space in Ørestad. In addition, a total of 13 buildings are under construction.

==Areas in Ørestad==
Since the turn of the millennium, a total of 65 buildings have been built, including more than 3000 flats, {{convert|71,400|m²|0|abbr=on}} for educational use and {{convert|65,000|m²|0|abbr=on}} of retail stores in the whole of Ørestad.

===Ørestad North===
[[File:Nyekua.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Faculty of Humanities (University of Copenhagen)|Faculty of Humanities]] by the [[Universitetskanalen|University Canal]] ]]
Ørestad North is the most developed of the four areas of Ørestad. It is developed according to a masterplan by KHR Arkitekter from 1997 around a central "[[village green]]", the [[Den Landskabelige Kanal|Landscape Canal]] and the north-south-oriented [[Universitetskanalen|University Canal]].

Major institutions in the area include the [[DR Byen]], which includes the Copenhagen Concert Hall, and several educational facilities such as the [[IT University of Copenhagen]] and [[University of Copenhagen]]'s Southern Campus.There are around 1,000 residential units in Ørestad North, half which are student housing in [[Tietgenkollegiet]] and [[Bikuben Kollegiet]].

===Amager Fælled===
The protected Amager Fælled district remains largely undeveloped.

===Ørestad City===
[[File:Vandkunsten ørestaden 2007.jpg|thumb|Residential building in Ørestad City, by [[Tegnestuen Vandkunsten]] architects]]
Ørestad City is the area in Ørestad which has seen the most new construction since 2001 when the Ferring Tower was completed as the first building. The dominating features in the area include the Field's shopping mall and the Bella Center convention and exhibition center. In 2006, [[Daniel Libeskind]] created a master plan for the remaining area of Ørestad City, referred to as [[Ørestad Down Town]], located between Field's and Center Boulevard. In 2009, the 709-room Cab Inn Metro Hotel was completed to the design of Libeskind as the first building in this project.

Ørestad City has seen considerable construction of residential buildings since 2003, most of which are centered around [[Byparken]]. The most distinctive residential buildings in the area are the [[VM Houses]] and [[Mountain Dwellings]] by [[Bjarke Ingels]] and [[Julien De Smedt]], while another noteworthy building is [[Ørestad College]] by [[3XN]].

===Ørestad South===
Ørestad South will be dominated by large-scale commercial buildings in the northern part and residential developments in the southern part. A new headquarters for international consulting firm [[Ramboll]] and the [[Crowne Plaza Copenhagen Towers]] hotel, part of the [[Copenhagen Towers]] development, are located just south of the Øresund highway. Both are designed by [[Dissing + Weitling]]. In the southernmost part of Ørestad South the {{convert|57000|km2|abbr=off}} [[mixed-use development|mixed-use]] building [[8 House]] by Bjarke Ingels Group and the residential building Stævnen by Wilhelm Lauritzen Arkitekter are located.

==Future development==
[[File:IT University of Copenhagen - outside space.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Mikado Plads]] in front of Mikado House, designed by [[Arkitema]] and completed in 2010 ]]
Within the next 5 years the remaining three building sites in Ørestad Nord are expected to go under construction.

Only eight building sites remain to be built in Ørestad City apart from the so-called [[Libeskind]] site situated west and south of [[Field's]]. The masterplan for this {{convert|187,000|m²|0|abbr=on}} area was revealed in 2006 and suggests a significant all-curved complex consisting of some 11 office buildings including a 704-room [[Cab Inn Metro]] hotel and two 20-storey office/hotel buildings. There will be a central square and a partly glass-roofed arcade. Construction began late 2007 and will go on for the next 5–10 years.

The district plan for Ørestad South was approved in 2005.
The overall master plan follows the initial design as seen in the winning proposal of 1997.
Apart from the [[Copenhagen Towers]] complex adjacent to the motorway, two other master plans for two other complexes have been presented: One by [[Niels Torp]] for [[Ørestad Business Center]] and one by [[KHR arkitekter]] for The Hannemannsparken complex. All together these three complexes, situated just south of the motorway, will consist of some {{convert|285,000|m²|0|abbr=on}} of office space.
Construction of the [[Copenhagen Towers]] started late 2007.

[[Copenhagen Arena]], a multi-use indoor arena, is under construction in Ørestad Syd, planned to be opened in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Project Plan |url=http://www.copenhagen-arena.dk/en/about_the_project/Pages/Project-plan.aspx |publisher=Copenhagen Arena official website |accessdate=3 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A new school is also planned to open in 2015 as the Ørestad school reaches projected capacity.

==Transport==
The main arterial road from the north to the south is Ørestads Boulevard which runs along the southern part of the [[Copenhagen Metro]] line M1. The [[Øresund]] motorway E20 and the [[Øresund]] railway cuts through Ørestad, separating the two districts Ørestad City and Ørestad Syd. To the east the [[airport]] and the fixed [[railway]] and [[motorway]] link to [[Malmö]] can be reached within few minutes.

[[Ørestad Station]] is the main railway station in the area and is served by regional as well as inter-city trains on the [[Oresund Railway|Øresund Line]]. [[Copenhagen Airport]] can be reached in five minutes and [[Copenhagen Central Station]] can be reached in seven minutes. It offers interchange with the Copenhagen Metro line [[M1 (Copenhagen)|M1]], serving the rest of Ørestad as well as an alternative link to Copenhagen City Centre. The metro has six stops in Ørestad: [[Islands Brygge Station|Islands Brygge]] and [[DR Byen Station|DR Byen]] in the Ørestad Nord district, [[Sundby Station|Sundby]] in the Amager Fælled district, [[Bella Center Station|Bella Center]] and Ørestad in the Ørestad City district and [[Vestamager Station|Vestamager]] in the Ørestad Syd district.

In addition, bus lines serve the [[Faculty of Humanities (University of Copenhagen)|Faculty of Humanities]] of the University, [[Bella Center]], Ørestad City and Ørestad Syd. Bus stops in Ørestad City are along Ørestads Boulevard.
