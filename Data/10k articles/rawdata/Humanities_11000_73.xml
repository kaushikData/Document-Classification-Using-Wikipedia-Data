The '''Association for Diplomatic Studies and Training''' ('''ADST''') is a [[United States]] non-profit organization established in 1986 which chronicles the history of American foreign policy and practice.

The ADST's major initiative is the '''Foreign Affairs Oral History Project'''. ADST interviews American diplomats as soon as possible after their departure from government service about their professional assessments of American and foreign leaders, successful and unsuccessful policies, and foreign conflicts.&lt;ref name="loc"&gt;{{cite web|title=Frontline Diplomacy: The Foreign Affairs Oral History Collection of the Association for Diplomatic Studies and Training|url=https://www.loc.gov/collections/foreign-affairs-oral-history/about-this-collection/|website=loc.gov|publisher=[[Library of Congress]]|accessdate=February 21, 2017}}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[oral history]] project was begun by U.S. foreign service officer Charles “Stu” Kennedy in the 1980s who, after listening to several eulogies given at an ambassador's funeral, became concerned that the historically valuable, personal recollections of U.S. diplomats might be lost forever if not recorded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=It happened to me: Diplomats recount stories of crisis and survival|url=http://federalnewsradio.com/management/2014/09/it-happened-to-me-diplomats-recount-stories-of-crisis-and-survival/|accessdate=February 21, 2017|work=[[WFED]]|date=September 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Aldrich|first1=Richard|title=The Foreign Affairs Oral History Program|journal=Diplomacy &amp; Statecraft|date=July 1993|volume=4|issue=2|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09592299308405882}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally sponsored by [[Georgetown University]]'s [[Lauinger Library]], it was subsequently taken over by the ADST.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History|url=https://isd.georgetown.edu/history|website=Institute for the Study of Diplomacy|publisher=[[Georgetown University]]|accessdate=February 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project's collection is regularly referenced by media, including the ''[[Washington Post]]'', ''[[The Atlantic]]'', [[RealClearPolitics]], and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Torry|first1=Jack|title=Don't Blame Nixon for Scuttled Peace Overture|url=http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2015/08/09/dont_blame_nixon_for_scuttled_peace_overture_127667.html|accessdate=February 21, 2017|work=RealClearPolitics|date=August 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Langer|first1=Emily|title=Christian Chapman, U.S. diplomat who survived assassination attempt, dies at 95|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/obituaries/christian-chapman-us-diplomat-who-survived-assassination-attempt-dies-at-95/2016/12/21/508ff284-c7a8-11e6-bf4b-2c064d32a4bf_story.html|accessdate=February 21, 2017|work=[[Washington Post]]|date=December 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Diplomatic Life: It's Not All Striped Trousers and Sips of Tea|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/12/the-diplomatic-life-its-not-all-striped-trousers-and-polite-talks/383904/|accessdate=February 22, 2017|work=[[The Atlantic]]|date=December 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2576">A '''ballot measure''' is a piece of proposed [[legislation]] to be approved or rejected by eligible [[voter]]s. Ballot measures are also known as "propositions" or simply "questions".

Ballot measures differ from most legislation passed by [[representative democracies]]; ordinarily, an [[election|elected]] [[legislature]] develops and passes laws. Ballot measures, by contrast, are an example of [[direct democracy]].

In the [[United States]] ballot measures may be established by several different processes which vary amongst the states:&lt;ref&gt;[[Initiative &amp; Referendum Institute]] (2013).

USC.&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Initiative]], in which any citizen or organization may gather a predetermined number of [[signature]]s to qualify a measure for the [[ballot]];
* [[Popular referendum]], in which a predetermined number of signatures (typically lower than the number required for an initiative) qualifies a ballot measure repealing a specific act of the legislature;
* [[Legislative referral]] (a.k.a. "legislative referendum"), in which the legislature puts proposed legislation up for popular vote (either voluntarily or, in the case of a [[constitutional amendment]] as a required procedure).

'''''Being Different: An Indian Challenge to Western Universalism''''' is a [[2011 in literature|2011]] book by [[Rajiv Malhotra]], an Indian-American author, philanthropist and public speaker, published by [[HarperCollins]]. The book reverts the gaze of the [[western culture]]s on India, repositioning India from being the observed to the observer, by looking at the West from a [[Dharma|Dharmic]] point of view.

==About the book==
Malhotra intends to give a critique of western culture, by comparing it with Indian culture, as seen from a 'Dharmic point of view.' To accomplish this goal, he postulates a set of characteristics of western culture, and a set of characteristics of Indian culture and religion, characterised as "Dharmic." Malhotra explains that in ''Being Different'',
{{quote|'Dharma' is used to indicate a family of spiritual traditions originating in India which today are manifested as Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism and Sikhism. I explain that the variety of perspectives and practices of dharma display an underlying integral unity at the metaphysical level.{{sfn|Malhotra|2011|p=3}}}}

Malhotra summarizes his rationale for treating Dharmic traditions as a family, contrasting the family of Dharmic traditions with Abrahamic religions. He constructs their differences from this 'Dharmic perspective,' thereby 'reversing the gaze.'{{sfn|Malhotra|2012|p=371}} Malhotra clarifies that he is not replacing a West-centric view with a Dharma-centric view by proposing the reversal of gaze.{{sfn|Malhotra|2012|p=375}} Malhotra explains that he seeks a dialogue, where the world civilizations are not merely seen from the viewpoint of the West, but the west is also seen from a non-western, c.q. 'dharmic' point of view.{{sfn|Malhotra|2012|p=371}}

Malhotra calls for mutual respect as a higher standard for pluralism than tolerance. Mutual respect does not call for acceptance of beliefs held by others, only to have genuine respect for difference, because, beliefs are not facts.&lt;ref group=web&gt;{{cite news| author =Rajiv Malhotra | title='Tolerance Isn't Good Enough'|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/rajiv-malhotra/hypocrisy-of-tolerance_b_792239.html | work=Huffington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; Malhotra explains why this gaze from the other side benefits the West,{{sfn|Malhotra|2012|p=373}} explaining that he
{{quote|... hopes to set the terms for a deeper and more informed engagement between dharmic and Western civilizations."{{sfn|Malhotra|2011|p=2}}}}

==Overview==
Malhotra identifies "six distinct and fundamental points of divergence between the dharmic traditions and the West."&lt;ref group=web name="bdcom-synopsis"&gt;[http://beingdifferentbook.com/synopsis/ beingdifferentbook.com, ''Synopsis'']&lt;/ref&gt;  Malhotra argues that understanding these six points of divergence is crucial to recognizing the fallacy of  facile sameness arguments and to understanding senselessness of inculturation efforts.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} These points of divergence are:&lt;ref group=web name="bdcom-synopsis" /&gt;&lt;ref group=web name="Patheos Book Club" /&gt;
# Approaches to difference
# History-centrism versus inner sciences
# Integral versus synthetic unity
# The nature of chaos and uncertainty
# Translatability vs. Sanskrit
# Western universalism challenged

===Divergence 1: Approaches to difference===
According to Malhotra, there is a pervasive anxiety in the west over personal and cultural differences. Therefore, the west tries to assimilate and convert "all that does not fit its fundamental paradigms."&lt;ref group=web name="bdcom-synopsis" /&gt; According to Malhotra, this anxiety is grounded in schisms which are inherent in the western worldview. In contrast, "Dharmic traditions [...] are historically more comfortable with differences."&lt;ref group=web name="bdcom-synopsis" /&gt;

===Divergence 2: History Centrism versus inner sciences===
According to Malhotra, Dharmic traditions rely on adhyatma-vidya,{{refn|group=note|"Sciences of spirituality,"&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/topic/adhyatmavidya Encyclopædia Britannica, ''Adhyatmavidya'']&lt;/ref&gt; "True, Genuine and Authentic Spiritual Knowledge."&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://adhyatmavidya.com/ adhyatmavidya.com]&lt;/ref&gt;}} while the [[Abrahamic religions]] rely on God's interventions in human history.&lt;ref group=web&gt;{{cite web| author =Rajiv Malhotra |title=Problematizing God's Interventions In History|url=http://creative.sulekha.com/problematizing-god-s-interventions-in-history_103442_blog}}&lt;/ref&gt; For followers of history-centric (Abrahamic) religions, truth-claims based on history are more significant than the scriptural message itself. History-centric dogma such as original sin and resurrection become critical beliefs and no compromise can be made on their acceptance. This explains the centrality of Nicene creed to all major Christian denominations. Followers of history-centric religions believe that the God revealed His message through a special prophet and that the message is secured in scriptures. This special access to God is available only to these intermediaries or prophets and not to any other human beings.&lt;ref group=web&gt;{{cite web| author =Rajiv Malhotra |title=Problematizing God's Interventions In History|url=http://creative.sulekha.com/problematizing-god-s-interventions-in-history_103442_blog}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dharma traditions do not hold history central to their faith. Gautama Buddha emphasized that his enlightenment was merely a discovery of a reality that is always there. He was not bringing any new covenants from any God. The history of the Buddha is not necessary for Buddhist principles to work. In fact, Buddha stated that he was neither the first nor the last person to have achieved the state of enlightenment. He also asserted that he was not God nor sent by any God as a prophet, and whatever he discovered was available to every human to discover for himself. This makes Buddhism not History-Centric.

Malhotra explains how history-centrism or lack of it has implications for religious absolutist exclusivity vs. flexible pluralism:
{{quote|Abrahamic religions claim that we can resolve the human condition only by following the lineage of prophets arising from the Middle East. All other teachings and practices are required to be reconciled with this special and peculiar history. By contrast, the dharmic traditions – Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism and Sikhism -- do not rely on history in the same absolutist and exclusive way. This dharmic flexibility has made fundamental pluralism possible which cannot occur within the constraints of history centrism, at least as understood so far.&lt;ref group=web&gt;{{cite news| author =Rajiv Malhotra |title=Dharma and the new Pope|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/rajiv-malhotra/dharma-and-the-new-pope_b_2755683.html | work=Huffington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Divergence 3: Integral versus synthetic unity===
Both Western and Dharmic civilizations have cherished unity as an ideal, but with a different emphasis.  Here, Malhotra posits a crucial distinction between what he considers a "synthetic unity" that gave rise to a static intellectualistic Worldview in the West positioning itself as the Universal and an "integrative unity" that gave rise to a dynamically oriented Worldview based on Dharma.{{sfn|Tilak|2012}} While the former is characterized by a "top-down" essentialism embracing everything a priori, the latter is a "bottom-up" approach acknowledging the dependent co-origination of alternative views of the human and the divine, the body and the mind, and the self and society.

===Divergence 4: The nature of chaos and uncertainty===
Dharma philosophical systems are highly systematized in their approach to understanding ultimate reality and in carefully addressing what one can know through various means of knowledge.  However, this rigor does not restrict their freedom in being comfortable with social organization.  Indians exhibit remarkable openness to self-organization and decentralization.  Malhotra explains the basis for this openness:
{{quote|Hinduism weaves multiple narratives around the central motif of cooperative rivalry between order (personified as devas) and chaos (personified as asuras). A key myth shared by all the dharma traditions – the 'churning of the milky ocean,' or 'samudra-manthan' – shows the eternal struggle between two poles. The milky ocean is the ocean of consciousness and creativity, which is to be churned in order to obtain amrita, or the nectar of eternal life."&lt;ref group=web&gt;{{cite news| author =Rajiv Malhotra |title=Order, chaos and creation|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/Order-chaos-and-creation/articleshow/10552328.cms | work=The Times Of India}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Dharma actually recognises the need for both Order and Chaos to co-exist in the universe. In the story&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/Order-chaos-and-creation/articleshow/10552328.cms | work=The Times Of India | title=Order, chaos and creation – The Times of India}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prajapati attempts to create the Universe keeping Order and Chaos in dynamic balance. His initial attempts fail because they're too 'Jami'/homogenous or too 'Prthak'/different. Finally he gets the combination just-right by using the principle of 'Bandhuta/[[Bandhu]]' i.e. binding together dissimilar things by what is common across all things in the entire creation.

=== Divergence 5: Translatability vs. Sanskrit ===
Malhotra identifies various non-translatables in Sanskrit that have been mapped into Abrahamic religious concepts. These mis-translations then are used to draw sameness arguments or to denounce Hinduism. Malhotra explains that

{{quote|In the fashionable search for sameness in all religions, Holy Spirit in Christianity is often equated with Shakti or kundalini in Hinduism. However, these terms represent different, even incompatible cosmologies. Christianity assumes an inherent dualism between God and creation. This necessitates historical revelations along with prophets, priests and institutions to bring us the truth. But Shakti, being all-pervading, obviates dependence on these; its experience can be discovered by going within through yoga.&lt;ref group=web&gt;{{cite web| author =Rajiv Malhotra |title='Holy Spirit' is not the same as 'Shakti' or 'Kundalini'|url=http://www.beliefnet.com/Faiths/Hinduism/Articles/Holy-Spirit-is-not-the-same-as-Shakti-or-Kundalini.aspx?p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Malhotra gives example of a list of Sanskrit non-translatables and goes on to provide key differences in their original meaning and the most common translated word in English. For example,{{sfn|Malhotra|2011|p=251-306}}

===Divergence 6: Western universalism challenged===
Malhotra claims that refuting Western Universalism is one of the most important objectives of his book, the conscious effort from American and European individuals to make the rest of the world fit into the template provided by these civilizations. He claims that all people and culture are forced into the various schemes put forward to bring this about and asserts that modern laws, regulation, conventions and common practices are formed, whether consciously or not with Western Universalism in mind.

Malhotra then goes on to provide a case study of Germany for Western digestion and synthesis. He claims that late 18th and early 19th century saw a special interest in ancient India in European academia now called as Romantic movement and Indic origin of European culture started to compete with the earlier held Semitic origin. To satisfy German cultural and religious egotistic interests various German Romantic thinkers like [[Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel|K. W. F. Schlegel]] and [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|G. W. F. Hagel]] slowly digested Indic ideas, like [[monism]], and presented a caricature of India as the 'frozen other'. Malhotra says Hagel presented, "The ''[[Weltgeist]]'' or World Spirit is, in effect the protagonist of this history, and the West is extraordinary because it is destined to lead this journey while all other civilizations must follow or perish." He claims this narrative gave the West its privileges and those who doesn't fit into this scheme are not a part of history, even though the Spirit may use (parts of) them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hegel|first1=G. W. F.|title=Phenomenology of Spirit.|date=1977}}&lt;/ref&gt; Malhotra alleges "He (Hegel) laboriously criticizes Sanskrit and Indian civilization, arguing with European Indologists with the aim of assimilating some ideas (such as absolute idealism) into his own philosophy) while postulating India as the inferior other in order to construct his theory of the West. Asia's place in history is as an infant, whereas the West is mature and everyone's eventual destination." This argument led to justification of colonialism as a [[Teleology|teleological imperative]] by which the superior Europeans must appropriate others. For example, Hegel argues it is better for Africans to remain enslaved until they pass through a process of maturation that culminates in their total conversion to Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schlegel|first1=K. W. F.|title=The Philosophy of History|date=1859|page=120}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hegel regarded colonization as India's inevitable fate and was declared 'static' and incapable of progress by itself, and it was up to the West to colonize and 'operate' on her for her own benefit. Hegel's perception of India as stagnant and lacking history was perpetuated by [[Karl Marx]], who described India as caught in the 'Asiatic Mode of Production'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Marx|first1=Karl|title=The British Rule in India|url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1853/06/25.htm|accessdate=2 November 2015|publisher=New-York Herald Tribune|date=1853}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hegel writes, 'The Germanic Spirit (germanische Geist) is the Spirit of the New World (neuen Welt), whose end is the realization of the absolute truth... The destiny of the Germanic people is that of serving as the bearer of the Christian principle'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hegel|first1=G. W. F.|title=Lectures on the Philosophy of World History|date=1982|page=341}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus Hegel establishes that while the West is pure, some westerners (Germans) are purer than others. As [[Wilhelm Halbfass|Halbfass]] explains, 'European thought has to provide the context and categories for the exploration of all traditions of thought',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Halbfass|first1=Wilhelm|title=India and Europe : An Essay in Understanding|date=1988|publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=978-0887067952|page=96|url=https://www.amazon.com/India-Europe-An-Essay-Understanding/dp/0887067956|accessdate=2 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; which Malhotra argues sees the digestion of Indian civilization into Western categories as both natural and desirable. Malhotra also writes that, after Hegel's death his sweeping Eurocentric accounts of history was extrapolated which culminates at the Aryan identity. Malhtora states,

{{quote|Hegel's theory of history has led to liberal Western supremacy, which hides behind the notion of providing the 'universals'. These European Enlightenment presuppositions became incorporated in the confluence of academic philosophy, philology, social theories and 'scientific' methodologies – all of which were driven by various imperial and colonial values alongside Christian theology.}}

In February 2012, Patheos Book Club hosted a discussion of Being Different on their website. &lt;ref group=web name="Patheos Book Club"&gt;{{cite web |title=Patheos Book Club – Being Different|url=http://www.patheos.com/Books/Book-Club/Rajiv-Malhotra-Being-Different.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===International Journal of Hindu Studies===
'''Cleo McNelly Kearns'''

According to Kearns,  Malhotra puts forward a valuable challenge to Christian theology.{{sfn|Kearns|2012|p=349-368}} She also notes that Malhotra himself adds to the "binary thinking" which he rejects.{{sfn|Kearns|2012|p=349-368}}

==== Rita M. Gross ====
According to Gross, Malhotra has located "one of the most urgent tasks for human survival", namely the ability to accommodate diversity without judging one culture over another as superior or inferior.{{sfn|Gross|2012|p=323-334}}

====  Shrinivas Tilak ====
Tilak is appreciative of the "counterreading"{{sfn|Tilak|2012|p=306}} that Malhotra offers. According to Tilak, Malhotra "gives voice to Indic subjects who have been silenced or transformed by nineteenth century and contemporary Indological filters.{{sfn|Tilak|2012|p=306}} Tilak uses the term ''Dharmacatuskam'', "House of Dharma with Its Four Wings (Dharmas)",{{sfn|Tilak|2012|p=291}} to denote the sense of integration that underlies the Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism and Sikhism traditions.{{sfn|Tilak|2012|p=291}} Tilak points out that Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism and Sikhism offer various approaches to dharma, which are "not unitary but composite".{{sfn|Tilak|2012|p=295}}

====Gerald James Larson====
Gerald James Larson is critical of Malhotra's presentation of "differences". According to Larson,
Malhotra ignores the differences, to arrive at a "integral unity" "that is little more than a Neo-Vedanta or Neo-Hindu reading of the Bhagavad Gita documented with numerous citations from Aurobindo." Larson calls this the "Brahmin imaginary",{{refn|group=note|Doniger: "It is often convenient to speak of a Brahmin-oriented quasi-orthodoxy (or ortho-praxy [...]), which we might call the Brahmin imaginary or the idealized system of class and life stage (''varna-ashrama-dharma''). but whatever we call this constructed center, it is, like the empty center in the Zen diagram of Hinduisms, simply an imaginary point around which we orient all the actual Hindus who accept or oppose it; it is what Indian logicians call the straw man (''purva paksha''), against whom argues. The actual beliefs and practices of Hindus – renunciation, devotion, sacrifice, and so many more – are peripheries that the imaginary Brahmin center cannot hold.{{sfn|Doniger|2010|p=29-30}}}} the standard Brahmanical view of Indic religion and philosophy in its [[Neo-Vedanta|Neo-Hindu]] understanding.{{sfn|Larson|2012|p=313}} According to Larson, the "Brahmin imaginary" is an imagined "integral unity" that is adhered to only by a cultural elite, with very little reality "on the ground", as it were, throughout the centuries of cultural development in the South Asian region.{{sfn|Larson|2012|p=313}} Larson also criticises the use of the term "Dharma traditions" or "dharmic systems", which ignores the differences between the various Indian religions.{{sfn|Larson|2012|p=313}} Larson ends his review with the recommendation to move toward a future in which "being different" really reflects the  "differences' in Indic religion and thought, "in a manner that challenges but also learns from the ongoing interactions with "the West.""{{sfn|Larson|2012|p=320}}

====Robert A. Yelle====
Robert A. Yelle is highly critical of Malhotra's approach. According to Yelle, "there is little, if any, original scholarship in the book. It is the work of a polemicist," who uses western scholarship when criticizing the West, but ignores this scholarship when he presents his own nativist vision of "dharmic traditions." According to Yelle, Malhotra's vision is a mirror image of Orientalism, namely Occidentalism.{{sfn|Yelle|2012|p=337-338}} Robert A. Yelle also criticises Malhotra for his use of the term "dharmic traditions".{{sfn|Yelle|2012}} According to Yelle, Malhotra ignores the differences that exist among and within the various traditions of India. According to Yelle, Malhotra presents a thoroughly homogenized ideal of Hinduism, based on a limited choice of aspects from Vedanta philosophy and Yoga.{{sfn|Yelle|2012|p=338-339}} Yelle ends his review with the remark that there has been a gradual improvement in Western scholars' knowledge of Indian traditions. To come to a real dialogue, Indians must also be willing to look in the mirror, and be open to self-criticism.{{sfn|Yelle|2012|p=346}}

====Nicholas F. Gier====
Gier criticizes Malhotra for ignoring profound differences between Dharmic traditions in seeing an integral unity. Gier notices that Malhotra himself admits that there are ‘profound differences in theory and practice' in the Dharma traditions. According to Gier,this undermines Malhotra's principal claim that these philosophical schools are "integral".{{sfn|Gier|2012}}

===Other peer-reviewed reviews===
====Brian Campbell====
In the ''Journal of the Anthropological Society of Oxford'', Brian Campbell wrote that the book succeeds in fulfilling only one of its four goals. According to Campbell, it gives a simplistic view of modern colonialism. It also fails to reverse the gaze, and to apply dharmic categories to Western socio-cultural reality. According to Campbell, Malhotra does
succeed in tracing the difference between Western and Oriental thought.{{sfn|Campbell|2012|p=225}}

In [[lithic analysis]], a subdivision of [[archaeology]], a '''bulb of applied force''' (also known as a '''bulb of percussion''' or simply '''bulb of force'''&lt;ref&gt;Cotterell, Brian &amp; Johan Kamminga 1987. The formation of flakes, ''American Antiquity'', 52:675-708.&lt;/ref&gt;) is a defining characteristic of a [[lithic flake]]. Bulb of applied force was first correctly described by Sir John Evans, the cofounder of prehistoric archeology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = History of Shock Waves, Explosions and Impact: A Chronological and Biographical Reference|last = Krehl|first = Peter|publisher = Springer|year = 2009|isbn =|location = Berlin|pages =}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, bulb of percussion was coined scientifically by W.J. Sollas.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Archaeological Concepts, Techniques, and Terminology for American Prehistoric Lithic Technology.|last = Hranicky|first = Wm Jack|publisher = AuthorHouse|year = 2013|isbn =|location =|pages =}}&lt;/ref&gt; When a flake is detached from its parent  [[lithic core|core]], a portion of the [[Hertzian cone]] of force caused by the detachment blow is detached with it, leaving a distinctive bulb on the flake and a corresponding flake scar on the core. In the case of a unidirectional core, the bulb of applied force is produced by an initiated crack formed at the point of contact, which begins producing the Hertzian cone.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Lithics: Macroscopic Approaches to Analysis|last = Andrefsky|first = William|publisher = Cambridge|year = 1998|isbn =|location =|pages =}}&lt;/ref&gt; The outward pressure increases causing the crack to curve away from the core and the bulb formation. The bulb of applied force forms below the striking platform as a slight bulge. If the flake is completely crushed the bulb will not be visible. Bulbs of applied force may be distinctive, moderate, or diffuse, depending upon the force of the blow used to detach the flake, and upon the type of material used as a fabricator. The bulb of applied force can indicate the mass or density of the tool used in the application of the force. The bulb may also be an indication of the angle of the force. This information is helpful to archaeologists in understanding and recreating the process of flintknapping. Generally, the harder the material used as a fabricator, the more distinctive the bulb of applied force. Soft hammer percussion has a low diffuse bulb while hard hammer percussion usually leaves a more distinct and noticeable bulb of applied force. Pressure flake also allowed for diffuse bulbs. The bulb of percussion of a flake or blade is convex and the core has a corresponding concave bulb. The concave bulb on the core is known as the negative bulb of percussion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.archaeologywordsmith.com/lookup.php?category=&amp;where=headword&amp;terms=bulb+of+percussion|title = Archaeology Wordsmith|website = www.archaeologywordsmith.com|access-date = 2016-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bulbs of applied force are not usually present if the flake has been struck off naturally. This allows archaeologists to identify and distinguish natural breakage from human artistry. The three main bulb types are flat or nondescript, normal, and pronounced. A flat or nondescript bulb is poorly defined and does not rise up on the ventral surface. A normal bulb on the ventral side has average height and well-defined. A pronounced bulb rises up on ventral side and is very large.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

When explained visually, the bulb of percussion is visible on the ventral face as opposed to the dorsal face (where it is smoother) and considered to be on the "inside" of the parent core.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://antiquity.ac.uk/ProjGall/mortensen/index.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-07-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130602045123/http://antiquity.ac.uk/projgall/mortensen/index.html |archivedate=2013-06-02 |df= }} "Error | Antiquity Journal"&lt;/ref&gt; The bulb of percussion is the primary feature that identifies the ventral surface of a flake or blade artifact. Locating its position reveals which is the proximal[[proximal end| ]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;end of an artifact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stoneageartifacts.com/html/glossary.html|title=Glossary of Terms: Stone Age Artifacts, Paleolithic, Neolithic, Mousterian, Mesolithic age tools|work=stoneageartifacts.com|accessdate=23 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along the proximal end there may be the formation of ripple marks. These ripple marks allow for the direction traveled by the applied force through the lithic when it was detached.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Typically, the striking of the flake is produced by [[knapping]] (or flintknapping), a process in which requires the user to chip away material from high-silica stones like "flint" in a carefully controlled manner with special tools to produce sharp projectile points or tools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flintknappingtools.com/knapping.html|title=What Is Flintknapping?|work=flintknappingtools.com|accessdate=23 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A common characteristic that is associated with the bulb of applied force is a bulbar scar. This scar is from a small chip or flake on the bulb. This is known as an eraillure flake scar. It is produced during the initial impact of flake removal. Occasionally, there is more than one contact point on a striking platform which creates a series of superimposed waves.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The eraillure flake is a chip removed through contact of a dominant force wave that creates the conchoidal flake and inferior waves. Bulb of applied force is not produced by bipolar technology or wedging initiation.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The '''Casa de la Cacica''' is a 16th-century [[Mixtec]] building complex in [[Teposcolula]], [[Oaxaca]], [[Mexico]].

Its current name, meaning "house of the [[Cacique|cacica]]" in [[Spanish language|Spanish]], may refer to Doña [[Catalina de Peralta]] who took possession of the home in 1569.&lt;ref&gt;Terraciano (2001): p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''challenge''' can serve as a dare or an exhortation, motivating a person or persons by "[a]n invitation or summons to a trial or contest of any kind" and thus to "a difficult or demanding task, esp[ecially] one seen as a test of one's abilities or character".&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite OED | challenge}}
&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense, speakers or writers can use challenges to [[motivation | motivate]] - to convince people "to perform an action they otherwise [might] not".&lt;ref&gt; 
Compare https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/challenge
&lt;/ref&gt;
A challenge can thus become a [[Rhetorical device | tool]] of [[rhetoric]]: a '''rhetorical challenge'''.&lt;ref&gt;

| quote = [...] the story behind the rhetorical power of the term 'challenge' assumes the most importance when the speaker becomes not only a describer of 'challenges' but their maker, when he shifts from using 'challenge' as a noun, to using it performatively as a verb. [...] Recall how one of the more notable traces of Morris's influence on the speech was his organization  of an anaphoric structure based on the command, 'I challenge.' Through this device, the speaker could shift from describing issues into a mode of exhortation, epitomized by the repetition of 'I challenge' twenty-five times, and its context-specific entailments - for example, 'I urge,' 'I invite,' and so on.

The eastern area adjoining Watergate Street was Palmers Wharf.

==History==

===Royal Dockyard===
{{main article|Deptford Dockyard}}
The King's Yard was established in 1513 by Henry VIII as the first Royal Dockyard building vessels for the [[Royal Navy]], and the leading dockyard of the period.&lt;ref name="nmm-b5"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nmm.ac.uk/researchers/library/research-guides/the-royal-navy/research-guide-b5-royal-naval-dockyards |title=National Maritime Museum Research guide B5: Royal Naval Dockyards |publisher=Nmm.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=1 May 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100601092732/http://www.nmm.ac.uk/researchers/library/research-guides/the-royal-navy/research-guide-b5-royal-naval-dockyards |archivedate=1 June 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.portcities.org.uk/london/server/show/ConNarrative.52/chapterId/774/Deptford-and-Woolwich-Londons-Royal-Dockyards.html |title=Deptford and Woolwich: London's Royal Dockyards - The working Thames |publisher=Port Cities |date= |accessdate=1 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It brought a large population and prosperity to Deptford.&lt;ref name="lf"&gt;[http://www.london-footprints.co.uk/wkdeptmillwalladd.htm london-footprints.co.uk] Deptford Dockyard&lt;/ref&gt;

The docks are also associated with the knighting of [[Francis Drake|Sir Francis Drake]] by [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]] aboard the [[Golden Hind]],&lt;ref&gt;''Sir Francis Drake: The Queen's Pirate'', pp 218-19, H Kelsey, Yale University Press (1 September 2000), {{ISBN|0-300-08463-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; the legend of [[Sir Walter Raleigh]] laying down his cape for Elizabeth,&lt;ref&gt;''Sir Walter Ralegh and the Quest for El Dorado'', pages 83 &amp; 176, Marc Aronson, Clarion Books (17 April 2000), {{ISBN|0-395-84827-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Captain James Cook|Captain James Cook's]] third voyage aboard [[HMS Resolution (1771)|Resolution]],&lt;ref&gt;''Captain James Cook'', pp 273-294, Richard Hough, W.W.Norton (17 August 1996), {{ISBN|0-393-31519-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Martin Frobisher|Frobisher]]’s and [[George Vancouver|Vancouver]]’s voyages of discovery, despatching ships against the [[Spanish Armada]],&lt;ref&gt;Deptford and the Armada by Thankful Sturdee, The Times, 3 September 1888, p. 10, Col.

In 1698 [[Peter the Great|Tsar Peter I of Russia]] aged 25, came to Deptford to learn about shipbuilding and seamanship. He was granted the use of [[John Evelyn|John Evelyn’s]] Sayes Court, adjoining the Royal Dockyard, by [[William III of England|William III]]. In three months he and his party caused considerable damage to the famous&lt;ref name="lysons"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=45482 |title=Deptford, St Nicholas, The Environs of London: volume 4: Counties of Herts, Essex &amp; Kent (1796) by Daniel Lysons, pp. 359-385 |publisher=British-history.ac.uk |date=22 June 2003 |accessdate=1 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Charm of Sayes Court, John Evelyn as Garden Architect'' by W.

[[Christopher Wren|Sir Christopher Wren]] was instructed to survey the property and declared it "entirely ruined".&lt;ref&gt;Calendar of Treasury Books, 1697–1702, 158–9&lt;/ref&gt;  At the mouth of Deptford Creek, on the Fairview Housing estate, there is a statue, designed by [[Mihail Chemiakin]] and gifted by [[Russia]] commemorating Peter's visit.

===18th century and closure===
By the 18th century, due to the silting of the Thames,&lt;!-- and a few other reasons ... --&gt; the dockyard's use was restricted to ship building and distributing stores to other yards and fleets abroad. It was shut down from 1830 to 1844&lt;ref name="nmm-b5"/&gt; and in 1864 a [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliamentary]] Committee recommended that the dockyards at Deptford (and [[Woolwich Dockyard|Woolwich]]) should be closed. Their recommendation was accepted and the Deptford dockyard was closed in May 1869,&lt;ref&gt;Handbook to the Environs of London by James Thorne, John Murray, Albemarle Street, 1876&lt;/ref&gt; by which time it employed 800 people. It had produced some 450 ships, the last being the wooden screw [[corvette]] [[HMS Druid (1869)|HMS ''Druid'']] launched in 1869.&lt;ref name="lf"/&gt;

[[File:The site of Sayes Court manor house in 2009.jpg|thumb|right|The location of [[Sayes Court]] almshouses in 2009.]]

===Foreign Cattle Market===
Before [[refrigeration]] cattle had to be [[imported]] alive, and the Contagious Diseases (Animals) Act 1869 gave the [[City of London Corporation]] exclusive local authority for foreign animal imports and processing subject to its opening a market before January 1872.

The complete site at Deptford, including a lease on the LB&amp;SCR docks, was acquired and the market opened in 1871,&lt;ref name="1938 map"&gt;Supply Reserve Depot, Deptford. (Old Foreign Cattle Market). Skeleton Record Plan. Sheet No. 1 of a set of 4. Corrected to September 1938.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1889 the site had been extended to {{convert|27|acres}}. In 1907 at its peak, 184,971 [[cattle]] and 49,350 [[Domestic sheep|sheep]] were imported through the market but by 1912 these figures had declined to 21,547 cattle and 11,993 sheep.&lt;ref name="times-1926"&gt;''Sale of Deptford Market. Government to Pay £387,000.'' The Times, 13 March 1926, p.12, col F&lt;/ref&gt;

===During the War years===
The Foreign Cattle Market was taken over by the [[War Department (United Kingdom)|War Department]] in 1914, on a tenancy agreement from the City of London Corporation, for use as the [[Royal Army Service Corps]] Supply Reserve Depot.&lt;ref name="1938 map"/&gt; On several occasions after the [[Armistice]] traders and others urged that the market should be reopened, however in 1924&lt;ref&gt;or 1926-27 according to the Supply Reserve Depot, Deptford. (Old Foreign Cattle Market). Skeleton Record Plan. Sheet No. 1 of a set of 4. Corrected to September 1938.&lt;/ref&gt; the War Office exercised their option to buy it&lt;ref name="times-1926"/&gt;&lt;ref name="times-1924"&gt;''Future of Deptford Market. War Office decision to buy.'' The Times, 6 February 1924, p12, col B&lt;/ref&gt; along with the adjacent the Sayes Court property for £400,500 ({{Inflation|UK|400500|1926|fmt=eq|cursign=£|r=-4}}){{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}} under [[deed]]s dated 25 March 1926, 18 March 1927 &amp; 25 July 1927 including the [[Rail transport|railway]], [[Tramway (industrial)|tramway]], [[wharf]]age and [[jetty]] rights and [[easements]].&lt;ref name="1938 map"/&gt;

The Royal Naval Victualling Depot operated here which included a rum store. During the Second World War a bomb destroyed one of the storehouses and killed a number of men, a plaque was visible in the early 1970s commemorating this tragedy. During the war, because of the Blitz some of the stores were dispersed to various locations including Park Royal.

The yard also served as a United States' [[Amphibious warfare|Advance Amphibious Vehicle]] base and married quarters during the Second World War.&lt;ref name="sh"&gt;Greenwich Industrial History [http://greenwichindustrialhistory.blogspot.com/2010/01/royal-dockyard-deptford_06.html Proposal to list the remains of the Royal Dockyard at Deptford] 6 January 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/default.htm PRO] Works 43/614-6&lt;/ref&gt;

===Latter part of 20th century===
On the closure of the Victualling Depot in the 1960s the establishment was renamed The Royal Naval Stores Depot and moved to a new building within Convoys Wharf. The Depot was the main Air Freight hub for the RN and was particularly busy during the Falklands War. It also continued as the central RN Stationery Store and Joint Services Baggage operations. The Depot closed in 1981.

The site purchased by News International from the UK [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] for £1,600,000 ({{Inflation|UK|1600000|1980|fmt=eq|cursign=£|r=-4}}),{{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}} and a remainder in 1986, for £340,000 ({{Inflation|UK|340000|1986|fmt=eq|cursign=£|r=-4}}).{{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.landregistry.gov.uk/|title=Land Registry - GOV.UK|publisher=|accessdate=19 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993 the Greenwich and Lewisham (London Borough Boundaries) Order transferred the site from the [[Royal Borough of Greenwich|London Borough of Greenwich]] to the [[London Borough of Lewisham]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/SI/si1993/Uksi_19931276_en_1.htm |title=The Greenwich and Lewisham (London Borough Boundaries) Order 1993 |publisher=Opsi.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=1 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Archaeology===
Most of the Tudor, Stuart, Georgian and Victorian structures above ground level that had survived until 1955 have since been destroyed.&lt;!-- more info how/why ... --&gt; One structure that escaped the demolition is Olympia Warehouse, a unique cast-iron building constructed in the 1840s.&lt;ref name="rr"&gt;[http://www.richardrogers.co.uk/render.aspx?siteID=1&amp;navIDs=1,4,22,132 Convoys Wharf London] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091003221105/http://www.richardrogers.co.uk/render.aspx?siteID=1&amp;navIDs=1,4,22,132 |date=3 October 2009 }}, Richard Rogers Partnership, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; However [[archaeological]] surveys carried out by CgMs and Pre-Construct Archaeology in 2000 by Duncan Hawkins, in 2000 by Jon Lowe and in 2001 by David Divers, established that by far the greater part of the dockyard survives as buried structures filled in intact between 1869 and 1950. The structures of the yard proper, the docks, slips, basins, mast ponds, landing places and stairs, constitute a substantial architectural fabric that is currently extant, though largely invisible, being covered by superficial accretion or infill.&lt;ref name="sh"/&gt; As yet there has been no archaeological investigation of the garden area of Sayes Court, and only limited trial trenching of part of the manor house.&lt;ref name="divers"&gt;CVW00, Convoys Wharf evaluation by CgMs Consulting on behalf of News International PLC by David Divers&lt;/ref&gt;

===International recognition===
In October 2013 Deptford Dockyard and Sayes Court garden were added to the [[World Monuments Fund]]'s 2014 watch list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wmf.org/project/deptford-dockyard-and-sayes-court-garden|title=Deptford Dockyard and Sayes Court Garden|publisher=|accessdate=19 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sayes Court==
{{Main article|Sayes Court}}

The War Department  hired the Sayes Court area and almshouses, from the [[City of London Corporation]] from 19 September 1914 to use as a Horse Transport Reserve Depot at a rental of £90 per annum ({{Inflation|UK|90|1914|fmt=eq|cursign=£|r=-2}}),{{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}}&lt;ref name="1938 map"/&gt; to enlarge its Supply Reserve Depot at the Foreign Cattle Market.&lt;ref&gt;Lewisham past and present, by John Coulter, Sutton Publishing, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[fee simple]] of the Foreign Cattle Market and of the Sayes Court property were purchased by the War Department, for £400,500 ({{Inflation|UK|400500|1926|fmt=eq|cursign=£|r=-4}}),{{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}} under [[deed]]s dated 25 March 1926, 18 March 1927 &amp; 25 July 1927 including the [[Rail transport|railway]], [[Tramway (industrial)|tramway]], [[wharf]]age and [[jetty]] rights and [[easements]].&lt;ref name="1938 map"/&gt;

==Dockyard railways==
From 15 December 1900 there was [[Tramway (industrial)|tramway]] access via Grove Street, to the  Foreign Cattle Market, using their own [[Maudslay Motor Company|Maudslay]] petrol locomotive. When the docks became an army depot the junction was relaid to [[standard gauge]] for direct connection to the [[London, Brighton and South Coast Railway|LB&amp;SCR]].&lt;ref&gt;London Bridge to East Croydon byVic Mitchell and Keith Smith, Middleton Press&lt;/ref&gt; There was as well, an internal [[Narrow gauge railway|narrow gauge]] tramway system. When the War Department took over, they introduced [[steam locomotive]]s to work the  tramways,&lt;ref name=Hartley&gt;{{cite book| author=Hartley K.E.| year=1964| title=The Sand Hutton Light Railway| publisher=The Narrow Gauge Railway Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The {{RailGauge|18in}} gauge is listed at {{cite web|url=http://parovoz.com/spravka/gauges-en.php |title=Railroad Gauge Width |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120717001706/http%3A%2F%2Fparovoz.com%2Fspravka%2Fgauges-en.php |archivedate=17 July 2012 |df=dmy }} as also having been used at [[Royal Arsenal Railway|Woolwich Arsenal]], [[Chatham Dockyard]], [[Crewe Works Railway|Crewe Locomotive Works]] and [[Horwich Works|Horwich Locomotive Works]]&lt;/ref&gt; purchasing between 1915 and 1917, twelve oil-fired Warril type {{RailGauge|18in}} [[Track gauge|gauge]] [[locomotive]]s from the [[Hunslet Engine Company]].&lt;ref&gt;18 Inch Gauge Steam Railways by Mark Smithers&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1920 the Government announced the sale of the equipment from the railway at the Deptford Meat Depot. In 1921 Sir Robert Walker purchased three locos and 75 wagons for the [[Sand Hutton Light Railway]], and purchased a fourth 1927. By January 1938 of the remaining eight locos, seven were apparently still in existence at Deptford, but out of use.&lt;ref name=Hartley/&gt;

==Development==
[[File:Grove Street gate.jpg|left|thumb|Protest graffiti on the Grove Street gateway.]]In October 2000, 'Creekside Forum' set up the 'Convoys Opportunity' [[umbrella group]] in response to the News International Ltd plan to sell the {{convert|40|acre|m2|adj=on}} Convoys Wharf site.&lt;ref&gt;''London Snoring'' at [http://creeksideforum.wordpress.com/london-snoring-2/ Creekside Forum News] 1 August 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Convoys Opportunity, composed of community organisations, churches, businesses and others in Deptford and beyond,&lt;ref name="tt09"&gt;Select Committee on Transport Written Evidence, [https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmselect/cmtran/299/299we12.htm Memorandum by the Creekside Forum (TT 09)] by Bill Ellson, Creekside Forum, July 2004&lt;/ref&gt; campaigned to have the News International scheme refused and the safeguarding order upheld.

[[File:Deptford Convoy's Wharf.jpg|left|thumb|Convoys Wharf]]In 2002 News International applied to the London Borough of Lewisham for outline planning permission to erect 3,500 residential units on the site. Lewisham councillors resolved to approve the application in May 2005. The [[Grade II listed]] Olympia Warehouse would have to be preserved and refurbished as part of the redevelopment of the site.&lt;ref name="rr"/&gt; New International engaged [[Richard Rogers]] to develop a masterplan for the site.&lt;ref name="pc"&gt;[http://www.convoyswharf.com/planning-context Planning Context]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:View of Convoys Wharf from the Thames Path.jpg|right|thumb|The [[Thames Path]] interrupted by Convoys Wharf]]If the Mayor allowed the application it would then be referred to the [[Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government]]. Reasons for such a referral would include a Government direction that half the site is safeguarded for freight use. Since freight wharves on the Thames were safeguarded in 1997 by the then Secretary of State for the Environment, [[John Gummer]], only one operational wharf has been lost to residential use without a full public inquiry. This was Delta/Blackwall Wharf, a major [[Construction aggregate|aggregates]] wharf redeveloped as part of the [[Greenwich Peninsula]] masterplan.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

On 18 May 2005 a 50/50 joint venture company of [[Cheung Kong Holdings]] and Hutchison Whampoa entered into an agreement to acquire Convoys Wharf, to develop it as a mixed residential and commercial project, with [[News International]] retaining a profit share in the sale of the luxury homes proposed.&lt;ref&gt;http://notice.singtao.com/ADMA/00013/epdf/2140405-CKH-PA(e)5555.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008 a new planning application was submitted by Hutchison based largely on the original Richard Rogers scheme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.building.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=29&amp;storycode=3152565&amp;c=1 |title=Mothballed £700m Deptford housing scheme on track |publisher=Building |date=6 November 2009 |accessdate=1 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2011 Hutchison Whampoa engaged [[Aedas]] to develop a new masterplan for the site and submitted an amendment planning application. Then in early 2012 Hutchison appointed [[Terry Farrell (architect)|Terry Farrell]] to revise the masterplan for the site and submitted a planning application in April 2013.&lt;ref name="pc"/&gt;

In September 2011 a group of local residents launched a campaign, with the name ''Deptford Is..'' to oppose the masterplan proposed by the developers. They have proposed a couple of projects to connect to the history of the area and benefit the local community. These are  the Lenox project (see below) and Sayes Court Garden.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deptfordis.org.uk/p/our-campaign-so-far.html Our campaign so far] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131027183445/http://www.deptfordis.org.uk/p/our-campaign-so-far.html |date=27 October 2013 }} at Deptford Is ...&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 October 2013, [[Boris Johnson]], the Mayor of London called in the application.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.london.gov.uk/priorities/planning/public-hearings/convoys-wharf "Convoys Wharf", Greater London Authority] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140115023034/https://www.london.gov.uk/priorities/planning/public-hearings/convoys-wharf |date=15 January 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2014 Lewisham Council's strategic planning committee recommended that the outline planning application for Convoys Wharf in its current form be rejected.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deptfordis.org.uk/2014/01/still-long-way-to-go-with-convoys-wharf.html Council recommends rejection of Convoys Wharf application] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202100425/http://www.deptfordis.org.uk/2014/01/still-long-way-to-go-with-convoys-wharf.html |date=2 February 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bdonline.co.uk/news/council-asks-mayor-to-reject-%C2%A31bn-convoys-wharf-scheme/5065932.article|title=Council asks mayor to reject £1bn Convoys Wharf scheme|work=Building Design|accessdate=19 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 January 2014 [[Joan Ruddock|Dame Joan Ruddock]] challenged the government to recognise the unique heritage features of the site.&lt;ref&gt;[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140122/debtext/140122-0004.htm#140122107000002 Convoys Wharf, Deptford], Daily Hansard - Debate, 22 January 2014 : Column 408&lt;/ref&gt;

On 31 March 2014 the Mayor of London, [[Boris Johnson]], approved plans to build up to 3,500 new homes on the Convoys Wharf site that has been derelict for since 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/london/boris-johnson-backs-1bn-deptford-development-9227796.html|title=Boris Johnson backs £1bn Deptford development|date=1 April 2014|work=Evening Standard|accessdate=19 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Lenox Project===
In 2013 the Lenox Project put forward a formal proposal to build a full-size sailing [[Ship replica|replica]] of [[HMS Lenox (1678)|HMS ''Lenox'']], a 70-gun [[ship of the line]] originally built at Deptford Dockyard in 1678.  The ship would actually be constructed on the dockyard site, and would form the centrepiece of a purpose-built museum which would remain as a permanent part of the development of Convoys Wharf.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 | url = http://councilmeetings.lewisham.gov.uk/mgAi.aspx?ID=6194
 | title =  Build the Lenox
 | date = 11 July 2013
 | website = councilmeetings.lewisham.gov.uk
 | publisher =  Lewisham Borough Council
 | access-date = 19 May 2016
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By late 2015 the project had gathered momentum, with more detailed plans fitting the building of the ''Lenox'' into the overall development of this part of Deptford.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 | url = http://www.buildthelenox.org/new-lenox-brochure-published/

 | date = 3 December 2015
 | website =  www.buildthelenox.org
 | publisher =   The Lenox Project
 | access-date = 19 May 2016
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The 2015 Feasibility Study identified the Safeguarded Wharf at the Western end of the Convoys Wharf site as the most suitable place for the dry-dock where the ship herself would be built; the existing but disused canal entrance could then be modified to provide an entrance for the dock as well as a home berth for the finished ship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 | url = http://www.buildthelenox.org/feasibility-study-report-published-by-gla

 | date =  8 January 2016
 | website =  www.buildthelenox.org
 | publisher =   The Lenox Project
 | access-date = 19 May 2016
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is hoped that the ''Lenox'' will provide a focus for the regeneration of the area as the comparable replica ship ''[[French frigate Hermione (2014)|Hermione]]'' did for [[Rochefort, Charente-Maritime|Rochefort]] in France.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3121">The '''Dakeyne hydraulic disc engine''' was a high pressure [[hydraulic engine]] built in the 19th century to power a [[flax]] [[Mill (grinding)|mill]] in Ladygrove, [[Derbyshire]], [[England]].

==History==
In the 1820s mill owners Edward &amp; James Dakeyne designed and constructed a [[nutating disc engine|disc engine]] known locally as "The Romping Lion" to make use of the high-pressure water available near their mill.

The Dakeyne brothers had previously invented  "The Equalinium", a machine for the preparation of flax for spinning, and their father Daniel Dakeyne (1733-1819)&lt;ref name=glover&gt;{{cite book | last = Glover | first = Stephen  | authorlink =  | coauthors =  | title = The History of the County of Derby | publisher = Henry Mozley and Son | date = 1829 | location =  | nopp =  | page = 363 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=9gQVAAAAQAAJ | isbn =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; was granted a patent for this device in 1794. It is often said that Edward and James did not take out the patent themselves because they were minors at the time, but in fact they were 23 and 21 respectively.

Little is known of their engine other than from the somewhat unclear description accompanying the patent, which was granted in 1830. Its main castings were made at the Morley Park foundry near [[Heage]], and it weighed 7 tons and generated 35 horsepower at a head of 96 feet of water. 

Stephen Glover, in his gazetteer of Derbyshire, was enthusiastic about the prospects for the disc engine, foreseeing its use in all manner of applications, domestic as well as industrial, not only as a prime mover but also as a pump. He stated that John Dakeyne had also commissioned a disc engine to drive the bellows of an organ in the family's residence, Knabb House.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal
  | last =Glover
  | first =Stephen
  | title =History &amp; Gazetteer Of Derbyshire
  | pages =354
  |date=1833}} &lt;/ref&gt;

A larger model was constructed to drain lead mines at [[Alport]] near [[Youlgreave]] and many steam versions were subsequently built by other people.

The machine itself is difficult to describe. Frank Nixon, in his book "The Industrial Archaeology of Derbyshire" (1969), commented that: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The most striking characteristic of this ingenious machine is perhaps the difficulty experienced by those trying to describe it; the patentees &amp; Stephen Glover only succeeded in producing descriptions of monumental incomprehensibility.&lt;ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1015">The '''Davignon report''', published on 27 October 1970, was a report on the future foreign policy of [[European Economic Community]] member nations. It was written by a council chaired by [[Étienne Davignon]] of the [[Belgian]] Foreign Office. The committee was appointed by the [[Council of the European Union|Council of the European Communities]] to make proposals on political cooperation between the member states. It recommended that member states should try to speak with a single voice on international problems, a proposal that was approved by all six member governments. It resulted first in [[European Political Cooperation]] and later in the [[European Union]]'s [[Common Foreign and Security Policy]] in 1992.

'''El Palmillo''' is a [[Mesoamerica]]n [[Mesoamerican chronology|Classic Period]] [[archaeological site]] located in the [[Valley of Oaxaca]], associated with the [[pre-Columbian]] [[Zapotec civilization]] which was centered in the valley and the surrounding highlands of the present-day state of [[Oaxaca]], [[Mexico]]. Located on a hilltop in the eastern [[Tlacolula]] arm of the valley, El Palmillo is just to the south of the pre-Columbian site of [[Mitla]] and to the east of the major Zapotec regional center, [[Monte Albán]].

A major excavation at the site has been ongoing since 1999, led by Dr. Gary Feinman and Linda Nicholas of the [[Field Museum of Natural History]].

The '''exchange of women''' is an element of [[alliance theory]] - the [[structuralism|structuralist]] theory of [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]] and other [[anthropologist]]s who see society as based upon the [[patriarchy|patriarchal]] treatment of women as property, being given to other men to cement alliances.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Book and the Text: The Bible and Literary Theory|author=[[Regina Schwartz]]|publisher=Blackwell|year=1990|isbn=0-631-16861-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Such formal exchange may be seen in the ceremony of the traditional Christian [[wedding]],{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}} in which the [[bride]] is given to the [[Bridegroom|groom]] by her father.

==Kinship==
The structuralist view of kinship was laid out in Lévi-Strauss' grand statement: ''Les Structures élémentaires de la parenté'' (The Elementary Structures of Kinship).  In this, he combined [[Marcel Mauss|Mauss]]' ideas about the importance of [[gift]]s in primitive societies with the role of the [[incest]] taboo in forcing exchanges of mates outside of closely related family groups.  The resulting ''exchange of women'' is asymmetric in that men have power over women which is not reciprocated.  The resulting social structures provide a framework for treating the oppression of women as a [[social construct]] rather than being a matter of biology.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=trxGYWX_XNgC|title=Feminist Anthropology|chapter=4 The Traffic in Women|author=Gayle Rubin|pages=92–95|year=2006|isbn=978-1-4051-0196-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biblical patriarchy==
Men in ancient [[Hebrew]] culture established and negotiated their relations with other men through the exchange of female relatives.  This is seen in [[Old Testament]] narratives such as the stories spread across the books of [[Joshua]], [[Book of Judges|Judges]], [[Samuel (Bible)|Samuel]] and [[Books of Kings|Kings]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Sex, Honor and Power in the Deuteronomistic History: A Narratological and Anthropological Analysis|author=Kenneth A. Stone|publisher=[[Continuum International Publishing Group]]|year=1996|isbn=1-85075-640-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criminal treatment==
In [[Afghanistan]] and remote areas of [[Pakistan]], women may be exchanged in compensation for a debt or offence such as murder.  This practice is known as ''[[Swara (custom)|swara]]''.  Pakistan's constitution prohibits this with a penalty of 3 to 10 years of imprisonment but the custom still persists.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2008%5C07%5C16%5Cstory_16-7-2008_pg11_1|title=Trapped by traditions|author=Sohail Chaudhry|date=July 16, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In art==
The exchange of women in the course of male bonding appears as a theme in the novels ''[[The Great Gatsby]]'' and ''[[Tropic of Capricorn (novel)|Tropic of Capricorn]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.henry-miller.com/narrative-literature/a-generalized-exchange-of-women.html|title=Henry Miller and the Rise of New Critical Modernism|chapter=7. Desire in the Waste Land A generalized exchange of women|author=Raoul Ibarguen|year=1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Indecent Proposal]]'' and other female-barter movies were criticized for promoting this theme.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|publisher=Los Angeles Times|author=Patrick Goldstein|date=April 18, 1993|pages=8|title=A flurry of recent women-as-barter movies looks like a disturbing trend to feminists ...

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3781">'''Geomontography''' was a printing method, that consisted in the combination of [[Paper embossing|embossing]] and of multiple color printing, and that was used primarily for the production of maps.&lt;ref name="Daumas"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Daumas |first1=Maurice |date= |year=1970 |title=A History of Technology &amp; Invention: The expansion of mechanization, 1725-1860 |url= |access-date=|dead-url= |format= |language=English |location= |publisher=Crown Publishers |pages=701–702 |isbn= |archive-url= |archive-date= |via= |subscription= |quote= |trans-quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The color layers were applied using [[lithography|lithographic techniques]], and then the embossing was used to give relief to buildings, walls, mountains and other architectural and geographic features. Sometimes, the raised elements of the map were left unprinted, such as in Bauerkeller's 1846 map of Paris, while the rest of the picture was printed with vivid colors. The same method was sometimes used for the production of relief prints of buildings, plants, sculptures, landscape views or other graphic motives. Several of these maps were exposed at the Industrial World Fair of Paris in 1839.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hebenstreit |first1=Wilhelm |date= |year= |title=Wissenschaftlich-literarische Encyclopädie der Ästhetik |trans-title=Scientific-literary encyclopedia of aesthetics |url=https://books.google.fr/books?id=03GppzIhgg4C |access-date=|dead-url= |format= |language=German |location= |publisher=Georg Olms Verlag |page=297 |pages= |isbn= |archive-url= |archive-date= |via= |subscription= |quote= |trans-quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The technique was developed by the German printer [[Georg Michael Bauerkeller]] (1805 - 1886) and his half-brother Georg Leonhart Bauerkeller, who worked in [[Frankfurt am Main]] and in [[Karlsruhe]] before opening a printing and embossing office in Paris in the late 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.darmstadt-stadtlexikon.de/b/bauerkeller-praegeanstalt.html |title=Bauerkeller, Prägeanstalt |author= |date= |website=Stadtlexicon Darmstadt |publisher=Historischer Verein für Hessen e.V. |access-date= |language=german}}&lt;/ref&gt; Georg Michael Bauerkeller deposited a patent application for his invention in France, in January the 18th, 1839. However, even if the manufacturing process was patented, the term ''geomontographie'' (''geomontography'') was not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Dörflinger |first=Johannes| date=1981 |title=Dauer und Kosten des Karten-Kupferstichs — dargestellt an Hand von Karten des Wiener Verlags Artaria &amp; Co. aus der 1.

The process was adopted for the teaching of the blind, and maps embossed in that manner where employed at Paris' [[Institut National des Jeunes Aveugles|Institut des Jeunes Aveugles]] (Institute for the Blind Youth), that were offered to the children for them to finger-read.&lt;ref name="Daumas"/&gt; Laas d'Aguen, a supervisor of the institute, reinforced the printed maps by embossing additional layers of blank paper using the same [[platen]], so the paper sheets would stick together creating a rigid cardboard material. This was done so to avoid deforming and damaging the paper under the blind readers finger's pressure.

The '''bibliography of George Orwell''' includes journalism, essays, novels and non-fiction books written by the British writer Eric Blair (1903–50), either under his own name or, more usually, under his pen name [[George Orwell]]. Orwell was a prolific writer on topics related to contemporary English society and literary criticism, whom the British newsweekly ''[[The Economist]]'' in 2008 declared "perhaps the 20th century's best chronicler of English culture."&lt;ref name="NGr5l" /&gt; His non-fiction cultural and political criticism constitutes the majority of his work, but Orwell also wrote in several genres of fictional literature.

Orwell is best remembered for his political commentary as a left-wing anti-totalitarian. As he explained in the essay "[[Why I Write]]" (1946), "Every line of serious work that I have written since 1936 has been written, directly or indirectly, against totalitarianism and for democratic socialism, as I understand it."&lt;ref name="Kj8yk" /&gt; To that end Orwell used his fiction as well as his journalism to defend his political convictions. He first achieved widespread acclaim with his fictional [[novella]] ''[[Animal Farm]]'' and cemented his place in history with the publication of ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' shortly before his death. While fiction accounts for a small fraction of his total output, these two novels are his best-selling works, having sold almost fifty million copies in sixty-two languages by 2007—more than any other pair of books by a twentieth-century author.&lt;ref name="OSxat" /&gt;

Orwell wrote non-fiction—including book reviews, editorials, and investigative journalism—for a variety of British periodicals. In his lifetime he published hundreds of articles including several regular columns in British newsweeklies related to literary and cultural criticism as well as his explicitly political writing. In addition he wrote book-length investigations of poverty in Britain in the form of ''[[Down and Out in Paris and London]]'' and ''[[The Road to Wigan Pier]]'' and one of the first retrospectives on the [[Spanish Civil War]] in ''[[Homage to Catalonia]]''. Between 1941 and 1946 he also wrote fifteen "[[London Letters]]" for the American political and literary quarterly ''[[Partisan Review]]'', the first of which appeared in the issue dated March–April 1941.

Only two compilations of Orwell's body of work were published in his lifetime, but since his death over a dozen collected editions have appeared. Two attempts have been made at comprehensive collections: ''Complete Essays, Journalism and Letters'' in four volumes (1968–70), co-edited by Ian Angus and Orwell's widow [[Sonia Brownell]]; and ''The Complete Works of George Orwell'', in 20 volumes, edited by [[Peter Davison (professor)|Peter Davison]], which  began publication in the mid-1980s. The latter includes an addendum, ''The Lost Orwell'' (2007).

The impact of Orwell's large corpus is manifested in additions to the [[Western canon]] such as ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'', its subjection to continued public notice and scholarly analyses, and the changes to vernacular English it has effected—notably the adoption of "[[Orwellian]]" as a description of totalitarian societies.

==Books: non-fiction and novels==
Orwell wrote six novels: ''[[Burmese Days]]'', ''[[A Clergyman's Daughter]]'', ''[[Keep the Aspidistra Flying]]'', ''[[Coming Up for Air]]'', ''[[Animal Farm]]'' and ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]''. Most of these were semi-autobiographical. ''Burmese Days'' was inspired by his period working as an imperial policeman and is fictionalized; ''A Clergyman's Daughter'' follows a young woman who passes out from overwork and wakes up an amnesiac, forced to wander the countryside as she finds herself, eventually losing her belief in God, despite being the daughter of a clergyman. ''[[Keep the Aspidistra Flying]]'' and ''[[Coming Up for Air]]'' are examinations of the British class system. ''Animal Farm'' and ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'' are his most famous novels: both are anti-totalitarian books which criticize the Soviet Union in particular.

In addition to his novels Orwell also wrote three non-fiction books. ''[[Down and Out in Paris and London]]'' records his experiences [[wikt:tramping|tramping]] and teaching in those two cities. ''[[The Road to Wigan Pier]]'' is initially a study of poverty in the North of England, but ends with an extended autobiographical essay describing some of Orwell's experiences with poverty. ''[[Homage to Catalonia]]'' recounts his experiences as a volunteer fighting [[fascism]] with the [[Workers' Party of Marxist Unification]] in [[anarchist Catalonia]] during the [[Spanish Civil War]].

==Articles==
Orwell wrote hundreds of essays, book reviews and editorials. His insights into [[linguistics]], literature and politics—in particular [[anti-fascism]], [[anti-communism]], and [[democratic socialism]]—continued to be influential decades after his death.&lt;ref name="influence" /&gt; Over a dozen of these were published in collections during his life—''[[Inside the Whale and Other Essays]]'' by his original publisher [[Victor Gollancz Ltd]] in 1940, and ''[[Critical Essays (Orwell)|Critical Essays]]'' by [[Harvill Secker (publisher)|Secker and Warburg]] in 1946. The latter press also published the collections ''Shooting an Elephant and Other Essays'' in 1950 (republished by Penguin in 2003) and ''England Your England and Other Essays'' in 1953.

Since his death many collections of essays have appeared, with the first attempt at a comprehensive collection being the four-volume ''Collected Essays, Letters and Journalism of George Orwell'' edited by [[Ian Angus (librarian)|Ian Angus]] and [[Sonia Brownell]], which was published by Secker and Warburg and [[Harcourt Trade Publishers|Harcourt, Brace, Jovanovich]] in 1968–1970. Peter Davison of [[De Montfort University]] spent 17 years researching and correcting the entirety of Orwell's works&lt;ref name="complete" /&gt; with Angus and Sheila Davison, and devoted the last eleven volumes of the twenty-volume series ''The Complete Works of George Orwell'' to essays, letters, and journal entries. The entire series was initially printed by Secker and Warburg in 1986, finished by [[Random House]] in 1998, and revised between 2000 and 2002.

==Pamphlets==
Starting with ''The Lion and the Unicorn'' (1941), several of Orwell's longer essays took the form of [[pamphlet]]s:
*''[[The Lion and the Unicorn: Socialism and the English Genius]]'' was printed by his publisher Secker and Warburg as Searchlight Books No. 1 on 19 February 1941.
*''[[Betrayal of the Left]]'' was printed by his other regular publisher Victor Gollancz Ltd. in 1941, with material from [[Victor Gollancz]], [[John Strachey (politician)|John Strachey]], and others.
*''Victory or Vested Interest?'' came from The Labour Book Service on 15 May 1942, with Orwell's "Culture and Democracy" (made up of the pieces "Fascism and Democracy" and "Patriots and Revolutionaries") amongst others.
*''Talking to India, by E. M. Forster, Richie Calder, Cedric Dover, Hsiao Ch'ien and Others: A Selection of English Language Broadcasts to India'' was published in 1943 by [[Allen &amp; Unwin]], edited with an introduction by Orwell.
*''[[Second Thoughts on James Burnham|James Burnham and the Managerial Revolution]]''&amp;nbsp;– Socialist Book Centre, printing of ''Second Thoughts on James Burnham'' under this title in July 1946.
*''[[The English People (essay)|The English People]]'' was printed by [[HarperCollins]] 1947.
*''British Pamphleteers Volume 1: From the 16th Century the 18th Century'' from Allan Wingate, spring 1948 was co-edited by Orwell and [[Reginald Reynolds]] with an introduction by Orwell.

==Poems==
Orwell was not widely known for writing verse, but he did publish several poems that have survived, including many written during his school days:&lt;ref name="earlywork" /&gt;

*"Awake! Young Men of England" (1914)
*"{{lang|fr|Ballade}}" (1929)
*"A Dressed Man and a Naked Man" (1933)
*"A Happy Vicar I Might Have Been" (1935)
*"Ironic Poem About Prostitution" (written prior to 1936)
*"Kitchener" (1916)
*"The Lesser Evil" (1924)
*"A Little Poem" (1935)
*"On a Ruined Farm Near the His Master's Voice Gramophone Factory" (1934)
*"Our Minds Are Married, but We Are Too Young" (1918)
*"The Pagan" (1918)
*"The Wounded Cricketer" (1920)
*"Poem from Burma" (1922–1927)
*"Romance" (1925)
*"Sometimes in the Middle Autumn Days" (1933)
*"Suggested by a Toothpaste Advertisement" (1918–1919)
*"Summer-like for an Instant" (1933)
*"As One Non-Combatant to Another" (1943)

In October 2015 Finlay Publisher, for The Orwell Society, published ''George Orwell: The Complete Poetry'', compiled and presented by Dione Venables.&lt;ref name="HhCIV" /&gt;&lt;ref name="boqEe" /&gt;

==Editing==
In addition to the pamphlets ''British Pamphleteers Volume 1: From the 16th Century the 18th Century'' and ''Talking to India, by E. M. Forster, Richie Calder, Cedric Dover, Hsiao Ch'ien and Others: A Selection of English Language Broadcasts to India'', Orwell edited two newspapers during his Eton years—''College Days''/''The Colleger'' (1917) and ''Election Times'' (1917–1921). While working for the [[BBC]], he collected six editions of a poetry magazine named ''Voice'' which were broadcast by Orwell, [[Mulk Raj Anand]], [[John Atkins (writer)|John Atkins]], [[Edmund Blunden]], Venu Chitale, [[William Empson]], [[Vida Hope]], Godfrey Kenton, [[Una Marson]], [[Herbert Read]], and [[Stephen Spender]]. The magazine was published and distributed to the readers before being broadcast by the BBC. Issue five has not been recovered and was consequently excluded from W. J. West's collection of BBC transcripts.

==Collected editions==
Two essay collections were published during Orwell's lifetime—''[[Inside the Whale and Other Essays]]'' in 1940 and ''Critical Essays'' in 1946 (the latter published in the United States as ''Dickens, Dali, and Others'' in 1958.) His publisher followed up these anthologies with ''Shooting an Elephant and Other Essays'' in 1950, ''England Your England and Other Essays'' in 1953—which was revised as ''Such, Such Were the Joys''—and ''Collected Essays'' in 1961. The first significant publications in the United States were [[Doubleday and Company|Doubleday]]'s ''A Collection of Essays by George Orwell'' from 1954, 1956's ''The Orwell Reader, Fiction, Essays, and Reportage'' from Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, and [[Penguin Group|Penguin]]'s ''Selected Essays'' in 1957; re-released in 1962 with the title ''Inside the Whale and Other Essays'' and in abridged form as ''Why I Write'' in 2005 as a part of the [[Penguin Great Ideas|Great Ideas series]]. In the aforementioned series, Penguin also published the short collections ''Books v. Cigarettes'' (2008), ''Some Thoughts on the Common Toad'' (2010), and ''Decline of the English Murder'' (2009). The later does not contain the same texts as ''Decline of the English Murder and Other Essays'', published by Penguin in association with Secker &amp; Warburg in 1965. The complete texts Orwell wrote for the ''Observer'' are collected in ''Orwell: The Observer Years'' published by [[Atlantic Books]] in 2003.

In 1976 [[Harvill Secker (publisher)|Martin Secker &amp; Warburg Ltd]] in association with Octopus Books published ''The Complete Novels'', this edition was latter republished by [[Penguin Books]] in 1983, and reprinted in [[Penguin Classics]] 2000 and 2009. Since the publication of Davison's corrected critical edition, [[John Carey (critic)|John Carey]]'s thorough ''Essays'' was released on 15 October 2002, as a part of the [[Everyman's Library]] and [[George Packer]] edited two collections for [[Houghton Mifflin]], released on 13 October 2008—''All Art Is Propaganda: Critical Essays'' and ''Facing Unpleasant Facts: Narrative Essays''.

[[Sonia Orwell]] and Ian Angus edited a four volume collection of Orwell's writings, ''The Collected Essays, Journalism and Letters of George Orwell'', divided into four volumes:
:*''An Age Like This 1920–1940''
:*''My Country Right or Left 1940–1943'' (first published 1968)
:*''As I Please, 1943–1945''
:*''In Front of Your Nose, 1945–1950''
''The Complete Works of George Orwell'' is a twenty-volume series, with the first nine being devoted to the non-fiction books and novels and the final eleven volumes entitled:
:*''A Kind of Compulsion: 1903–1936''
:*''Facing Unpleasant Facts: 1937–1939''
:*''A Patriot After All: 1940–1941''
:*''All Propaganda Is Lies: 1941–1942''
:*''Keeping Our Little Corner Clean: 1942–1943''
:*''Two Wasted Years: 1943''
:*''I Have Tried to Tell the Truth: 1943–1944''
:*''I Belong to the Left: 1945''
:*''Smothered Under Journalism: 1946''
:*''It Is What I Think: 1947–1948''
:*''Our Job Is to Make Life Worth Living: 1949–1950''

In 2001 Penguin published four selections from ''The Complete Works of George Orwell'' edited by Peter Davison in their modern classics series titled ''Orwell and the Dispossessed: Down and Out in Paris and London in the Context of Essays, Reviews and Letters selected from The Complete Works of George Orwell'' with an introduction by [[Peter Clarke (historian)|Peter Clarke]], ''Orwell's England: The Road to Wigan Pier in the Context of Essays, Reviews, Letters and Poems selected from The Complete Works of George Orwell'' with an introduction by [[Ben Pimlott]], ''Orwell in Spain: The Full Text of Homage to Catalonia with Associated Articles, Reviews and Letters from The Complete Works of George Orwell'' with an introduction by [[Christopher Hitchens]], and ''Orwell and Politics: Animal Farm in the Context of Essays, Reviews and Letters selected from The Complete Works of George Orwell'' with an introduction by [[Timothy Garton Ash]].

Davison later compiled a handful of writings—including letters, an obituary for [[H. G. Wells]], and his reconstruction of [[Orwell's list]]—into ''Lost Orwell: Being a Supplement to The Complete Works of George Orwell'', which was published by Timewell Press in 2006, with a paperback published on 25 September 2007. In 2011, Davison's selection of letters and journal entries were published as ''George Orwell: A Life in Letters'' and ''Diaries'' by Harvill Secker.&lt;ref name="nybooks" /&gt; A selection by Davison from Orwell's journalism and other writings were published by Harvill Secker in 2014 under the title ''Seeing Things as They Are''.

==Other works==
After his first publication—the poem "Awake! Young Men of England", published in the ''Henley and South Oxfordshire Standard'' in 1914—Orwell continued to write for his school publications ''The Election Times'' and ''College Days''/''The Colleger''.&lt;ref name="earlywork" /&gt; He also experimented with writing for several years before he could support himself as an author. These pieces include first-hand journalism (e.g. 1931's "[[The Spike (essay)|The Spike]]"), articles (e.g. 1931's "Hop-Picking"), and even a one-act play—''Free Will''. (He would also adapt four plays as radio dramas.)

His production of fiction was not as prolific—while living in Paris he wrote a few unpublished stories and two novels,&lt;ref name="UdVSq" /&gt; but burned the manuscripts (Orwell routinely destroyed his manuscripts and with the exception of a partial copy of ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'', all are lost. Davison would publish this as ''Nineteen Eighty-Four: The Facsimile of the Extant Manuscript'' by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt in May 1984, {{ISBN|0-15-166034-4}}.) In addition, Orwell produced several pieces while working at the [[BBC]] as a correspondent. Some were written by him and others were merely recited for radio broadcast. For years, these went uncollected until the anthologies ''Orwell: The War Broadcasts'' (Marboro Books, June 1985 and in the United States, as ''Orwell: The Lost Writings'' by [[Arbor House]], September 1985) and ''Orwell: The War Commentaries'' ([[Gerald Duckworth and Company|Gerald Duckworth &amp; Company Ltd.]], London, 1 January 1985) were edited by W. J. West. Orwell was responsible for producing ''The Indian Section'' of [[BBC World Service|BBC Eastern Service]] and his program notes from 1 February and 7 December 1942, have survived (they are reproduced in ''War Broadcasts''). He was also asked to provide an essay about British cooking along with recipes for ''The British Council''. Orwell kept a diary which has been published by his widow—Sonia Brownell—and academic Peter Davison, in addition to his private correspondence.

|Published in ''[[Tribune (magazine)|Tribune]]'' under the authorship of "John Freeman" (possibly in reference to [[John Freeman (British politician)|British politician of the same name]]) and later attributed to Orwell by Davison.{{refn|group=note|Orwell's authorship of this article is disputed. In a review published in ''[[Times Higher Education]]'', Scott Bradfield writes: &lt;blockquote&gt;There are also times when Davison seems in too big a hurry to add a hitherto neglected item to the canon, such as his inclusion of an essay titled: "Can socialists be happy?" which was originally published under the name John Freeman. "Freeman" is the sort of nom de plume Orwell might have relished, and the essay does refer to many of Orwell's favourite subjects. But it is also just about the worst piece of writing in this entire edition, studded with the sort of wooden, thesis-driven paragraphs you might expect from a class in freshman composition. As Davison provides no compelling evidence that this essay must have been written by Orwell, the world could probably live without it.&lt;ref name="IAnme" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; While Peter Davison—the editor of the ''Complete Works''—writes: &lt;blockquote&gt;George Orwell's payment book for 20 December 1943, records the sum of pounds 5.50 for a special article of 2,000 words for ''Tribune''. This has never been traced in ''Tribune'' under Orwell's name but it now seems certain that an essay, entitled 'Can Socialists Be Happy?' by 'John Freeman' is what is referred to. The name Freeman would have appealed to Orwell as a pseudonym, and the article has many social, political and literary links with Orwell, such as the relation of Lenin to Dickens (the fact that Lenin read ''A Christmas Carol'' on his deathbed also appears in the second paragraph of Orwell's 1939 essay, 'Charles Dickens'). A 'real' John Freeman, later editor of the ''New Statesman'', has confirmed that he did not write the article. The reason why Orwell chose to write as 'John Freeman' he never used this pseudonym again is not clear. It may be that ''Tribune'' did not want its literary editor to be seen to be associated with its political pages. Possibly it was a device that allowed Orwell to be paid a special fee. Or it may be that he simply wished to see how far ''Tribune'' would let him go with his opinions. In any case, the article appeared in the Christmas issue and provoked much debate in the issues that followed.&lt;ref name="v3VVJ" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;}}

|Short story published unsigned in ''The Election Times'' No. 4, pp.&amp;nbsp;15–24&lt;ref name="Fenwick172" /&gt;{{refn|group=note|name=ElectionTimes|''The Election Times'' was produced by Eric Blair (Orwell) and other Eton scholars. Issues consisted of sets of handwritten pages and the precise makeup of each issue is therefore unclear. Blair was involved in the production of five issues, out of which only one, Number 4 (3 June 1918) have survived intact. Blair is listed as business manager, Denys King-Farlow as art manager, and [[Roger Mynors]] as editor. Attributions of authorship is complicated because contributions were anonymous and the producers sometimes wrote out texts other than their own. 
&lt;br/&gt;
Out of the contributions which can be attributed to Orwell with some certainty, Davison lists the three short stories, "The Adventure of the Lost Meat-card", "A Peep into the Future", and "The Slack-bob", as published in ''The Election Times'' No. 4. Fenwick additionally lists the dramatic sketch "Free Will", the poem "The Wounded Cricketer (Not Walt Whitman)", and two stanzas of the poem "The Youthful Mariner", as published in the issue. According to Davison the poems and the dramatic sketch listed by Fenwick, as well as the poem "The Photographer" and some or all of the poem "The Millionaires Pearl" may have formed part of the issue or may have been intended for another issue. All five of these uncertain additions, as well as "The Slack-bob", were, however, later reprinted in their original, or revised, form in ''College Days'' No. 5. For further discussion on attribution of the texts in ''The Election Times'', see Davison, ''The Complete Works'', Vol. 10, entry 29.&lt;ref name="Fenwick172–3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="vZiFq" /&gt;}}

'''Gerardo Munck''' (born October 13, 1958), [[Argentine]] by birth, is a [[professor]] of international relations and political science, in the [[University of Southern California School of International Relations|School of International Relations]] of the [[University of Southern California]] (USC). His brother, [[Ronaldo Munck]], is a well-known [[Sociology|sociologist]], living in Ireland. His grandmother was the [[Argentine]] record-setting [[Marathon swimming|marathon swimmer]] [[Lilian Harrison]].

==Education==
Munck earned his undergraduate degree in [[Political Science]] from the [[University of New Hampshire]], a Master's in [[Latin American Studies]] at [[Stanford University]], and his PhD in [[Political Science]] from the [[University of California, San Diego]] (UCSD).&lt;ref&gt;Munck CV. [http://dornsife.usc.edu/tools/mytools/PersonnelInfoSystem/DOC/Faculty/SIR/vita_1003560.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic Research==
Munck works in the field of [[comparative politics]] and is a specialist on political [[regime]]s and [[democracy]], [[methodology]] (with an emphasis on [[measurement]]), and [[politics]] in [[Latin America]].

He also does research on the [[intellectual history]] of the field of [[comparative politics]] and on the conditions for the production of knowledge about the social world.

===Methodology of Measurement===
Munck proposes a comprehensive framework for the construction and assessment of data on political concepts that distinguished between three tasks: conceptualization, measurement, and aggregation. Furthermore, consistent with [[Giovanni Sartori|Giovanni Sartori’s]] work on concepts, Munck emphasizes the need (1) to form a concept before seeking to measure it and, relatedly, (2) to theorize the relationship among conceptual properties and hence highlight how conceptual attributes are always parts of conceptual systems rather than treat them by default as unrelated and hence adequately represented by an additive model.&lt;ref&gt;Gerardo L. Munck and Jay Verkuilen, “Conceptualizing and Measuring Democracy: Evaluating Alternative Indices,” ''Comparative Political Studies'' 35, 1 (2002): 5-34 [http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.469.3177&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf] ; Gerardo L. Munck , ''Measuring Democracy: A Bridge Between Scholarship and Politics'' (Baltimore, Md.: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Concept of Democracy===
In his work on the concept of  [[democracy]], Munck has argued against the common tendency to propose a concept of democracy that simply incorporates features of the political systems of countries in the West considered to be exemplars of democracy. In turn, he has advocated a broadening of the concept of democracy beyond the strict electoral sphere. In addition to being a system that has inclusive, clean and competitive elections for key national offices of government, democracy extends to two additional spheres: (1) Democracy extends to the domain of government decision-making and requires political institutions that allow a majority of citizens to change the status quo; and (2) democracy extends to the social environment of politics and requires a social context that does not turn the principles of political freedom and equality into mere formalities.&lt;ref&gt;Gerardo L. Munck, “The Study of Politics and Democracy: Touchstones of a Research Agenda,” pp. 25-37, in Gerardo L. Munck (ed.), ''Regimes and Democracy in Latin America. Theories and Methods'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2007); Gerardo L. Munck, “What is Democracy? A Reconceptualization of the Quality of Democracy,” ''Democratization'' 23, 1 (2016): 1-26. [https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2299128]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public Activity==
Munck is active in various public initiatives in the fields of democratic [[governance]] and of transparency and [[accountability]].

He collaborated with [[Dante Caputo]] and [[Guillermo O'Donnell]] in the preparation of the [[UNDP|United Nations Development Programme’s (UNDP)]] report ''Democracy in Latin America. Toward a Citizens’ Democracy'' (2004).&lt;ref&gt;United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), ''Democracy in Latin America. Toward a Citizens’ Democracy'' (New York and Buenos Aires: UNDP and Aguilar, Altea, Taurus, Alfaguara, 2004).  [https://web.archive.org/web/20140525213906/http://www.votb.org/elsalvador/Reports/Report_Democracy_in_Latin_America_New.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt; He developed a methodology to monitor elections for the [[Organization of American States|Organization of American States (OAS)]].&lt;ref&gt;''Methods for Election Observation: A Manual for OAS Election Observation Missions'' (Washington, D.C.: Organization of American States, October 2007). [http://www.oas.org/en/spa/docs/methods%20manual.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt; And he worked with [[Dante Caputo]] on a second regional report on democracy in Latin America prepared by the UNDP and the Organization of American States (OAS), ''Nuestra democracia'' (2010).&lt;ref&gt;OAS (Organization of American States) and UNDP, ''Nuestra Democracia'' (México: OAS, UNDP and Fondo de Cultura Económica, 2010). Spanish version: [http://www.oas.org/es/sap/docs/Nuestra_Dem_s.pdf]; english version: [http://www.latinamerica.undp.org/content/dam/undp/library/Democratic%20Governance/UNDP-OAS_Our_Democracy_in_Latin_America.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt;

He also worked with the UNDP on a system to monitor corruption in Afghanistan,&lt;ref&gt;Angela Hawken and Gerardo L. Munck, “A Corruption Monitoring System for Afghanistan,” UNDP Accountability and Transparency (ACT) project, Kabul, Afghanistan, July 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; and wrote background papers for the UNDP regional reports on Asia and the Pacific on corruption and gender equality.&lt;ref&gt;See, respectively, UNDP Asia Pacific Human Development Report, ''Tackling Corruption, Transforming Lives'' (2008)  [http://hdr.undp.org/en/reports/regional/asiathepacific/RHDR_Full%20Report_Tackling_Corruption_Transforming_Lives.pdf]  and UNDP Asia Pacific Human Development Report, ''Power, Voice and Rights: A Turning Point for Gender Equality in Asia and the Pacific'' (2010).
[http://hdr.undp.org/en/reports/regional/asiathepacific/RHDR-2010-AsiaPacific.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt;

He was a member of the International Expert Panel of the [[Open Government Partnership]] (OGP) during 2013-2016.

[[Image:Valle-de-San-Millán.jpg|thumb|400px|Yuso, the lower of the San Millán monasteries]]

The '''Glosas Emilianenses''' (Spanish for "glosses of [the monastery of Saint] Millán/Emilianus") are [[gloss (annotation)|gloss]]es written in a [[Latin]] [[codex]]. These [[marginalia]] are important as early examples of writing in a form of Romance similar to [[Spanish language|Spanish]], and in [[Basque language|Basque]]. The anonymous author is assumed to have been a monk at the monastery now known as Suso ("the upper one"), one of the twin monasteries of [[San Millán de la Cogolla]] (now in [[La Rioja (autonomous community)|La Rioja]], then in the [[Kingdom of Navarre]]). He wrote about a thousand years ago in three languages:
* A simplified version of '''[[Latin]]'''
* '''The medieval form of a [[Iberian Romance languages|Hispanic Romance]] language''' (traditionally regarded as Castilian or [[Old Spanish]], but now most often classified as [[Navarro-Aragonese]] or a related dialect);
* '''Medieval Basque'''
The latter two would have been the [[vernacular]] languages in the region surrounding the monastery, although there is a possibility that the author of the glosses was an incomer to the area.&lt;ref&gt;The vernacular language in the region is now Spanish, but there are still some Basque place-names nearby, e.g. [[Ezcaray]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The Glosses were formerly considered to include the first instances of early Spanish. However, in November 2010, the [[Real Academia Española]] declared that the first appearances of written Spanish can be found in the [[Cartularies of Valpuesta]], medieval documents in Latin from the [[Burgos (province)|province of Burgos]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Location of the glosses==
The codex is known as ''Aemilianensis 60'' (''Aemilianus'' is Latin for [[Emilian of Cogolla|Emilian]], "[[Millán]]" or "[[Emilia (region of Italy)|Emilia]]no" in modern [[Spanish language|Spanish]]) and was preserved in the monastery library at Yuso (the lower re-foundation of the monastery). Its significance was recognised in the early twentieth century when it was brought to the attention of the philologist [[Ramón Menéndez Pidal]]. The manuscript's current location is the [[Real Academia de la Historia]] in [[Madrid]].

==Romance glosses==
[[Image:Codiceemil.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Page 72 of the Aemilianensis 60 codex. The [[gloss (annotation)|gloss]] in the bottom right-hand margin of the page is the most extensive one in the codex.]]There is still some debate as to whether the [[Iberian Romance language]] of the glosses should be classed as an early form of Castilian or of Aragonese, although some recent studies show that most features belong indeed to the latter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vallenajerilla.com/berceo/wolf/emilianensesotravez.htm {{es icon}} ''Las glosas emilianenses otra vez''], H.J.Wolf, ''Revista de Filología Románica'', nº 14, vol.I 1997, pp. 597-604. Servicio de Publicaciones, [[Universidad Complutense]], Madrid.&lt;/ref&gt; It is not the only text to be difficult to classify: other texts traditionally assumed to be in Old Spanish, like the [[Kharja]]s, are proved to be in a different medieval Romance, [[Mozarabic language|Mozarabic]], which happens to be classified along with Aragonese in a Pyrenean-Mozarabic group. Some scholars have proposed that it is anachronistic to classify such varieties of Ibero-Romance according to dialectal labels based on geographical particularism before the thirteenth century, leaving the Glosas to be understood as "in an unspecialized informal register of Ibero-Romance".&lt;ref&gt;Roger Wright, ''A Sociophilological Study of Late Latin,'' 242.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, should the Romance language of the glosses be classified, San Millán de la Cogolla's former reputation as the "birthplace of the Spanish language" was important in its designation as a [[World Heritage Site]] ("cultural" type) in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/805 Entry on the World Heritage website]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Text and translation===
The longest gloss appears on page 72 of the manuscripts. The Spanish [[philologist]] [[Dámaso Alonso]] called this little prayer the "first cry of the Spanish language" (in Spanish: ''"el primer vagido de la lengua española"''&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon}} [http://www.espanolsinfronteras.com/AcercaIdioma00.htm#PRIMER_VAGIDO_DE_LA_LENGUA_ESPA%C3%91OLA_-_D%C3%81MASO_ALONSO Primer vagido de la lengua española] Dámaso Alonso (retrieved from www.espanolsinfronteras.com)&lt;/ref&gt;).

Only two of the glosses in ''Aemilianensis 60'' (of a total of about one thousand) are actually in Basque.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vallenajerilla.com/berceo/nietoviguera/glosasvascuences.htm {{es icon}} ''Glosas en vascuence''] article by Juan Ángel Nieto Viguera on the Basque glosses&lt;/ref&gt; These short texts (only 6 words in total) can be seen on the 1974 plaque. However, it has been suggested that some of the Romance glosses reflect the influence of the Basque language, the implication being that their author was a fluent Basque-speaker.

'''Hamadia''' ({{lang-he-n|חֲמַדְיָה}}) is a [[kibbutz]] in the [[Beit She'an Valley]], just north of [[Beit She'an]] in northern [[Israel]]. It belongs to the [[Valley of Springs Regional Council]]. In {{Israel populations|Year}} it had a population of {{Israel populations|Hamadya}}.{{Israel populations|reference}} 

==History==
The kibbutz was founded in 1939 as part of the [[Tower and stockade]] movement.  It was re-established in 1942 by the "Hermonim" pioneers, a [[Gar'in|garin]] of native-born Israelis who were part of a youth group.
[[File:Hamadia ii.jpg|thumb|Hamadia. 1949]]
The kibbutz took its name from [[al-Hamidiyya]], an abandoned Arab village north of the kibbutz named for the [[sultan]] of [[Turkey]], [[Abdul Hamid II]].

==Archaeology==
The location is situated on a terrace of ancient [[Lake Beisan]], 200 metres below sea level.&lt;ref name="Avi-Yonah1978"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael Avi-Yonah|title=Encyclopedia of archaeological excavations in the Holy Land, p. 468|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O6ptAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=3 May 2011|year=1978|publisher=Prentice-Hall|isbn=978-0-13-275123-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tell Hamadia is a single layer archaeological site of about {{convert|100|m2|ha|abbr=on}}, first reported and excavated at Hamadia by N.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10089">{{Anthropology of kinship |concepts |image=Toraja house.jpg |caption=Three ''[[tongkonan]]'' noble "Houses" in a [[Toraja]]n village, Sulawesi.}}

In [[anthropology]], a '''house society''' is a society where [[kinship]] and political relations are organized around membership in corporately-organized dwellings rather than around [[descent group]]s or [[Lineage (anthropology)|lineage]]s, as in the "[[House of Windsor]]". The concept was originally proposed by [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]] who called them "''sociétés à maison''".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book |last=Lévi-Strauss |first=Claude |title=The Way of the Mask |year=1982 |publisher=University of Washington Press |location=Seattle}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lévi-Strauss, Claude. 1987. Anthropology and Myth: Lectures, 1951-1982. R. Willis, trans. Oxford: Basil Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; The concept has been applied to understand the organization of societies from [[Mesoamerica]] and the [[Moluccas]] to [[North Africa]] and medieval Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Joyce, Rosemary A. &amp; Susan D. Gillespie (eds.). 2000. Beyond Kinship: Social and Material Reproduction in House Societies. University of Pennsylvania Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carsten, Janet &amp; Stephen Hugh-Jones (eds.) About the House: Lévi-Strauss and Beyond. Cambridge University Press, May 4, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

The House society is a hybrid, transitional form between kin-based and class-based social orders, and is not one of Lévi-Strauss' '[[Alliance theory|elementary structures]]' of kinship. Lévi-Strauss introduced the concept as an alternative to 'corporate kinship group' among the cognatic kinship groups of the Pacific region. The socially significant groupings within these societies have variable membership because kinship is reckoned bilaterally (through both father's and mother's kin) and come together for only short periods. Property, genealogy and residence are not the basis for the group's existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Errington |first=Shelly |title=Meaning and Power in a Southeast Asian Realm |year=1989 |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=Princeton NJ |page=236}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== House societies and kinship ==

Lévi-Strauss' most succinct definition of a House was that it is "a corporate body holding an estate made up of both material and immaterial wealth, which perpetuates itself through the transmission of its name, its goods and its titles down a real or imaginary line considered legitimate as long as this continuity can express itself in the language of kinship or of affinity and, most often, of both."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lévi-Strauss |first=Claude |title=The Way of the Mask |year=1982 |publisher=University of Washington Press |location=Seattle |page=194}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three elements to this definition:&lt;ref name="Schrauwers 2004 75–6"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Schrauwers |first=Albert |title=H(h)ouses, E(e)states and Class: On the Importance of Capitals in central Sulawesi |journal=Bijdragen tot de Taal-, Land- en Volkenkunde |year=2004 |volume=160 |issue=1 |pages=75–6 |doi=10.1163/22134379-90003735}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# The House is a corporate body ("moral person") holding an estate made up of both material and immaterial goods.
# As a "moral person", it is an alternate metaphor replacing "blood" in defining the social identity of the group. As a symbol of the group, the House persists over generations and links the group to its sacred origins.
# The House persists over time by transmitting its titles through conditional kinship principles: "patrilineal descent and matrilineal descent, filiation and residence, hypergamy and hypogamy, close marriage and distant marriage, heredity and election: all these notions which usually allow anthropologists to distinguish the various known types of society, are united in the house, as if, in the last analysis the spirit (in the eighteenth-century sense) of this institution expressed an effort to transcend, in all spheres of collective life, theoretically incompatible principles."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lévi-Strauss |first=Claude |title=The Way of the Mask |year=1982 |publisher=University of Washington Press |location=Seattle |page=184}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Only the core group (the highest-ranking members) will inhabit the House as a residence. The other House members (which Errington refers to as the "server group") will only come together on special ritual occasions, making this an "occasional kinship group." Other House members have multiple overlapping ties to other Houses as well, through both mother's and father's kin. Their ability to assert a claim to membership in a House will depend on a number of criteria, such as their parents' participation, their ability to contribute to the House's upkeep, and their participation in its rituals. Successful claims of membership may bring special benefits, such as the right to utilize House resources with the consent of the core members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Errington |first=Shelly |title=Meaning and Power in a Southeast Asian Realm |year=1989 |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=Princeton NJ |pages=233–39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== House societies and social ranking ==

Most of the examples of ‘sociétés à maison’ cited by Lévi-Strauss, with the exception of the [[Kwakwaka'wakw|Kwakiutl]] Indians of the North-west coast of Canada, were [[Feudalism|feudal]]. This has led some to ask if feudalism was an essential feature of House societies, and answering in the negative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Waterson |first=Roxanna |title=About the House: Lévi-Strauss and Beyond |year=1995 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |pages=53–4 |chapter=Houses and hierarchies in island Southeast Asia |editor=Carsten J. and S. Hugh-Jones}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schrauwers, in contrast, has argued that House societies are characteristically organized around a system of [[Social stratification|social ranks]], not feudalism. That is, the House is not an economic class but a socially ranked group (e.g. a nobility) in a society organized around a system of social ranks; while a House may own property, it is thus not tied to a feudal mode of production. Schrauwers gives, as an alternate example, societies organized around slavery where a noble group's property are its slaves (such as the Kwakiutl case).&lt;ref name="Schrauwers 2004 75–6"/&gt;

== Houses and politics ==
{{Political anthropology}}

Houses are political in three ways; there is an intra-House politics by which leadership is determined and resources are allocated within the House, as well as an inter-House politics between rival Houses. These two forms of political engagement may be connected through agonistic exchange institutions such as the [[Potlatch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Errington |first=Shelly |title=Meaning and Power in a Southeast Asian Realm |year=1989 |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=Princeton NJ |pages=96–128}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is, lastly, also a politics of struggle and incorporation between highly ranked noble Houses and those groups like slaves and commoners who lack the resources to maintain their organization as a House.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Schrauwers |first=Albert |title=H(h)ouses, E(e)states and Class: On the Importance of Capitals in central Sulawesi |journal=Bijdragen tot de Taal-, Land- en Volkenkunde |year=2004 |volume=160 |issue=1 |pages=86–90 |doi=10.1163/22134379-90003735}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intra-House political struggle===
Houses are tied together through oftentimes contradictory forms of kinship, whether descent or alliance. Given that Houses are not lineages, leadership is rarely ascribed by genealogical seniority alone (i.e. [[primogeniture]]). Leadership of a House is gained through status competition.

===Inter-House political struggle===
A number of traditional Southeast Asian kingdoms, such as those in [[Negara: The Theatre State in Nineteenth-Century Bali|Bali]], or the kingdom of [[Luwu]] in Sulawesi, were dominated by noble Houses that competed with each other for control of the state. These states have alternately been described as [[Mandala (Southeast Asian political model)|mandala]] states.

===Political struggles between classes within a House society===
Although they may be referred to as House Societies, not all societies with Houses have those Houses uniformly distributed among all ranks and classes. The House in Bali, as well as in the kingdom of Luwu in Sulawesi, is an "optional" kinship group. Schrauwers has argued that class and House formation are linked. He points out, for example, that the inherited estate of some Sulawesi House societies in the kingdom of Luwu is composed of slaves; that is, the House's property is composed of another social rank of individuals. In this case, class and rank are synonymous. Because they are property, slaves are prevented from forming their own Houses. Commoners in those societies are of a different rank, but lack property, and therefore cannot form their own houses either.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schrauwers|first=Albert|title=H(h)ouses, E(e)states and Class: On the Importance of Capitals in central Sulawesi|journal=Bijdragen tot de Taal-, Land- en Volkenkunde|year=2004|volume=160|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The way in which these lower classes were prevented from forming Houses was two-fold. On the one hand, they might be engaged in the agonistic exchange systems with Noble Houses that results in their using up and losing all of their House property. On the other hand, noble Houses at the centre of the state might engage in policies of divide and rule, urging different groups at the periphery to attack each other, take slaves, and these would form Houses which then intermarry with the Houses at the centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Schrauwers |first=Albert |title=Houses, hierarchy, headhunting and exchange; Rethinking political relations in the Southeast Asian realm of Luwu |journal=Bijdragen tot de Taal-, Land- en Volkenkunde |year=1997 |volume=153 |issue=3 |pages=356–80 |doi=10.1163/22134379-90003928}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''human video''' is a form of [[theater]] combining [[music]], [[Modern Dance]] and [[drama]], along with [[interpretive dance]], [[American Sign Language]], [[pantomime]], and [[Mime artistry|classic mime]]. A human video consists of a [[song]] or [[Medley (music)|medley]] played over loudspeakers while actors use rhythmic physical movement (gestures and other movements of the limbs and body) to communicate emotions to a given audience.

The performance is presented in a form similar to a [[music video]]. It presents a story that illuminates a particular artistic intent through [[Proxemics|spatial relationships]], meaningful [[gesture]]s, and artistic [[Kinesics|movement]]. 

The story told within the video can be either implicit in the words of the song or a story written independently of the original artist's meaning.

Just as more "traditional" forms of theater can be situated on different types of [[Stage (theater)|stages]], so too can these dramatic acts. This particular form of drama can perform the same text in many different venues without disrupting its meaning. Because it typically has no [[Set construction|set]] and limited [[costume]]s, it can be performed in nearly any location.

[[Theatrical property|Props]] are sometimes used, but are forbidden in some competitive venues. In this instance, props are restricted in an effort to force creativity—because in the ideal Human Video, all actors on stage should be used to represent objects like [[Crucifix|crosses]], thrones, trees or giants. Actors movements demonstrate a [[narrative|story]] and the [[Theme (literature)|theme]] of the [[song]] being played.

In the [[United States]], one example of how human videos have permeated the [[Culture of the United States|culture]] is the inclusion of human videos in Fine Arts Festivals and church ministry groups ([[Assemblies of God]], [[Pentecostal]] Holiness Church, [[Church of God (Cleveland, Tennessee)|Church of God]], etc.) in a variety of [[Protestant]] [[Christian denomination|denominations]]. The Fine Arts Festival in the Assemblies of God denomination is the largest and most intense of all competitions and categories. Churches spend many months and countless hours practicing in order to receive recognition at the National Fine Arts Festival.

==History==
The name "human video" was coined by Randy Phillips. He is reported to have performed the first "human video" in a chapel service at Central Bible College, with several elements used from the then quite popular Deaf Ministry Team. It was used more formally in the early 1990s at Phoenix First Assembly of God led by Pastor Tommy Barnett.

Although elements of the form have existed in theatre for centuries and no one can actually claim to have invented it, Mr. Phillips began to use it as a ministry tool first at church services and then for outreach and missions with the help of Pastor Lloyd Ziegler and the ministry training program called Master's Commission.

Istanbul is a transcontinental city in [[Eurasia]], straddling the [[Bosporus]] [[strait]] (which separates [[Europe]] and [[Asia]]) between the [[Sea of Marmara]] and the [[Black Sea]]. Its commercial and historical center lies on the [[continental Europe|European side]] and about a third of its population lives on the [[Anatolia|Asian side]].&lt;ref name="wctr281"&gt;{{harvnb|WCTR Society; Unʼyu Seisaku Kenkyū Kikō|2004|p=281}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The city is the administrative center of the Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality ([[wikt:conterminous|coterminous]] with [[Istanbul Province]]), both hosting a population of around 15 million residents.&lt;ref name="Population of Turkey"/&gt; Istanbul is one of the [[world's largest cities|world's most populous cities]] and ranks as the world's [[List of cities proper by population|fourth-largest city proper]] and the [[list of European cities by population|largest European city]]. Istanbul is viewed as a bridge between the [[Eastern world|East]] and [[Western world|West]].

Founded under the name of ''Byzantion'' (Βυζάντιον) on the [[Sarayburnu]] promontory around 660 BCE, the city grew in size and influence, becoming one of the most important cities in history. After its reestablishment as ''Constantinople'' in 330 CE, it served as an imperial capital for almost 16 centuries, during the [[Roman Empire|Roman]]/[[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] (330–1204), [[Latin Empire|Latin]] (1204–1261), [[Byzantine Empire under the Palaiologos dynasty|Palaiologos Byzantine]] (1261–1453) and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] (1453–1922) empires.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Çelik|1993|p=xv}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was instrumental in the advancement of [[Christianity]] during Roman and Byzantine times, before the Ottomans [[fall of Constantinople|conquered the city]] in 1453 CE and transformed it into an Islamic stronghold and the seat of the [[Ottoman Caliphate]].&lt;ref name="maag1145"&gt;{{harvnb|Masters|Ágoston|2009|pp=114–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city's strategic position on the historic [[Silk Road]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dumper|Stanley|2007|p=320}}&lt;/ref&gt; rail networks to Europe and the Middle East, and the only sea route between the Black Sea and the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] have produced a cosmopolitan populace. While [[Ankara]] was chosen instead as the new Turkish capital after the [[Turkish War of Independence]], and the city's name was changed to Istanbul, the city has maintained its prominence in geopolitical and cultural affairs. The population of the city has increased tenfold since the 1950s, as migrants from across [[Anatolia]] have moved in and city limits have expanded to accommodate them.&lt;ref name="tu224"&gt;{{harvnb|Turan|2010|p=224}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ecoc-popdem"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibb.gov.tr/sites/ks/en-US/0-Exploring-The-City/Location/Pages/PopulationandDemographicStructure.aspx|publisher=Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality|title=Population and Demographic Structure|year=2008|accessdate=27 March 2012|work=Istanbul 2010: European Capital of Culture}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arts, music, film, and cultural festivals were established towards the end of the 20th century and continue to be hosted by the city today. Infrastructure improvements have produced a complex transportation network in the city.

Approximately {{nowrap|12.56 million}} foreign visitors arrived in Istanbul in 2015, five years after it was named a [[European Capital of Culture]], making the city the world's fifth most popular tourist destination.&lt;ref name=Mastercard&gt;{{cite web |url=http://newsroom.mastercard.com/press-releases/london-retains-crown-in-2015-mastercard-global-destinations-cities-index/ |title=MasterCard Global Destination Cities Index}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city's biggest attraction is its historic center, partially listed as a UNESCO [[World Heritage Site]], and its cultural and entertainment hub can be found across the city's natural harbor, the [[Golden Horn]], in the [[Beyoğlu]] district.

==Toponymy==
{{Main|Names of Istanbul}}
[[File:Rome-Capitole-StatueConstantin.jpg|left|thumb|upright|[[Constantine I]]]]

The first known name of the city is ''[[Byzantium]]'' ({{lang-el|Βυζάντιον}}, ''Byzántion''), the name given to it at its foundation by [[Megara|Megarean]] colonists around 660 BCE.&lt;ref name="roo177"&gt;{{harvnb|Room|2006|pp=177}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name is thought to be derived from a personal name, [[Byzas]]. Ancient Greek tradition refers to a legendary king of that name as the leader of the Greek colonists. Modern scholars have also hypothesized that the name of Byzas was of local [[Thracian]] or [[Illyria]]n origin and hence predated the Megarean settlement.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Georgacas|1947|p=352ff.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[Constantine the Great]] made it the new eastern capital of the [[Roman Empire]] in 330 CE, the city became widely known as [[Constantinople]], which, as the Latinized form of "{{lang|grc|Κωνσταντινούπολις}}" (''Konstantinoúpolis''), means the "City of Constantine".&lt;ref name="roo177"/&gt; He also attempted to promote the name "Nova Roma" and its Greek version "{{lang|grc|Νέα Ῥώμη}}" ''Nea Romē'' ([[New Rome]]), but this did not enter widespread usage.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gregory|2010|pp=62–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Constantinople'' remained the most common name for the city in the West until the establishment of the [[History of the Republic of Turkey|Turkish Republic]], and ''Kostantiniyye'' ({{lang-ota|قسطنطينيه}}) and ''Be Makam-e Qonstantiniyyah al-Mahmiyyah'' (meaning "the Protected Location of Constantinople") and ''İstanbul'' were the names used alternatively by the Ottomans during their rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Necipoğlu|2010|p=262}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of ''Constantinople'' to refer to the city during the Ottoman period (from the mid-15th century) is now considered politically incorrect, even if not historically inaccurate, by Turks.&lt;ref name="maag286"&gt;{{harvnb|Masters|Ágoston|2009|p=286}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 19th century, the city had acquired other names used by either foreigners or Turks. Europeans used ''Constantinople'' to refer to the whole of the city, but used the name ''[[Stamboul]]''—as the Turks also did—to describe the walled peninsula between the [[Golden Horn]] and the Sea of Marmara.&lt;ref name="maag286"/&gt; ''Pera'' (from the Greek word for "across") was used to describe the area between the Golden Horn and the Bosphorus, but Turks also used the name ''[[Beyoğlu]]'' (today the official name for one of the city's [[list of districts of Istanbul|constituent districts]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Masters|Ágoston|2009|pp=226–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Islambol'' (meaning either "City of Islam" or "Full of Islam") was sometimes colloquially used to refer to the city, and was even engraved on some Ottoman coins,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Finkel|2005|pp=57, 383}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the belief that it was the precursor to the present name, ''İstanbul'', is belied by the fact that the latter existed well before the former and even predates the [[Fall of Constantinople|Ottoman conquest of the city]].&lt;ref name="roo177"/&gt;

The name ''İstanbul'' ({{IPA-tr|isˈtanbuɫ|3=Istanbul pronunciation.ogg}}, colloquially {{IPA-tr|ɯsˈtambuɫ|}}) is commonly held to derive from the [[Medieval Greek]] phrase {{lang|grc|"εἰς τὴν [[Polis|Πόλιν]]"}} (pronounced {{IPA-el|is tim ˈbolin|}}), which means "to the city"&lt;ref&gt;Necdet Sakaoğlu (1993/94a): "İstanbul'un adları" ["The names of Istanbul"]. In: ''Dünden bugüne İstanbul ansiklopedisi'', ed. Türkiye Kültür Bakanlığı, Istanbul.&lt;/ref&gt; and is how Constantinople was referred to by the local Greeks. This reflected its status as the only major city in the vicinity. The importance of Constantinople in the Ottoman world was also reflected by its Ottoman name 'Der Saadet' meaning the 'gate to Prosperity' in Ottoman. An alternative view is that the name evolved directly from the name ''Constantinople'', with the first and third syllables dropped.&lt;ref name="roo177"/&gt; A Turkish folk etymology traces the name to Islam bol "plenty of Islam"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Online Etymology Dictionary|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=istanbul|accessdate=26 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; because the city was called ''Islambol'' ("plenty of Islam") or ''Islambul'' ("find Islam") as the capital of the Islamic Ottoman Empire. It is first attested shortly after the conquest, and its invention was ascribed by some contemporary writers to Sultan [[Mehmed II]] himself.&lt;ref name="IA"&gt;Necdet Sakaoğlu (1993/94a): "İstanbul'un adları" ["The names of Istanbul"]. In: 'Dünden bugüne İstanbul ansiklopedisi', ed. Türkiye Kültür Bakanlığı, Istanbul.&lt;/ref&gt; Some Ottoman sources of the 17th century, such as [[Evliya Çelebi]], describe it as the common Turkish name of the time; between the late 17th and late 18th centuries, it was also in official use. The first use of the word "Islambol" on coinage was in 1703 (1115 AH) during the reign of Sultan [[Ahmed III]]. Nevertheless, the use of the name ''Constantinople'' remained common in English into the 20th century, ''Istanbul'' became common after Turkey adopted the Latin alphabet in 1928 and urged other countries to use the city's Turkish name.&lt;ref name="Room"&gt;{{harvnb|Room|2006|pp=177–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gokturk"&gt;{{harvnb|Göktürk|Soysal|Türeli|2010|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern [[Turkish language|Turkish]], the name is written as ''İstanbul'', with a dotted İ, as the [[Turkish alphabet]] distinguishes between a [[dotted and dotless I]]. In English the stress is on the first or last syllable, but in Turkish it is on the second syllable (''tan'').&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Göksel|Kerslake|2005|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A person from the city is an ''İstanbullu'' (plural: ''İstanbullular''), although ''Istanbulite'' is used in English.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Keyder|1999|p=95}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The history of the city proper begins around 660 BCE,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bloom|Blair|2009|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|name=byz-date|The foundation of Byzantion ([[Byzantium]]) is sometimes, especially in encyclopedic or other tertiary sources, placed firmly in 667 BCE. Historians have disputed the precise year the city was founded.

[[Constantine the Great]] effectively became the emperor of the whole of the Roman Empire in September 324.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Barnes|1981|p=77}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two months later, he laid out the plans for a new, Christian city to replace Byzantium. As the eastern capital of the empire, the city was named ''[[New Rome|Nova Roma]]''; most called it Constantinople, a name that persisted into the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Barnes|1981|p=212}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 11 May 330, Constantinople was proclaimed the capital of the [[Roman Empire]], which was later permanently divided between the two sons of [[Theodosius I]] upon his death on 17 January 395, when the city became the capital of the [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Empire]].&lt;ref name="ba222"&gt;{{harvnb|Barnes|1981|p=222}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The establishment of Constantinople served as one of Constantine's most lasting accomplishments, shifting Roman power eastward as the city became a center of Greek culture and Christianity.&lt;ref name="ba222"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gr63"&gt;{{harvnb|Gregory|2010|p=63}}&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous churches were built across the city, including the [[Hagia Sophia]] which was built during the reign of [[Justinian I|Justinian the Great]] and remained the world's largest cathedral for a thousand years.&lt;ref name="klwa171"&gt;{{harvnb|Klimczuk|Warner|2009|p=171}}&lt;/ref&gt; Constantine also undertook a major renovation and expansion of the [[Hippodrome of Constantinople]]; accommodating tens of thousands of spectators, the hippodrome became central to civic life and, in the 5th and 6th centuries, the epicenter of episodes of unrest, including the [[Nika riots]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dash|first=Mike|url=http://blogs.smithsonianmag.com/history/2012/03/blue-versus-green-rocking-the-byzantine-empire/|title=Blue Versus Green: Rocking the Byzantine Empire|publisher=The Smithsonian Institution|work=Smithsonian Magazine|date=2 March 2012|accessdate=30 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dahmus|1995|p=117}}&lt;/ref&gt; Constantinople's location also ensured its existence would stand the test of time; for many centuries, its walls and seafront protected Europe against invaders from the east and the advance of Islam.&lt;ref name="gr63"/&gt; During most of the [[Middle Ages]], the latter part of the Byzantine era, Constantinople was the largest and wealthiest city on the European continent and at times the largest in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cantor|1994|p=226}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Morris|2010|pp=109–18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Constantinople began to decline continuously after the end of the reign of Basil II in 1025. The final blow was given by the conquest of Villardouin and Enrico Dandolo in 1204 during the [[Fourth Crusade]], where the City was sacked and pillaged.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gregory|2010|pp=324–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city subsequently became the center of the [[Latin Empire]], created by Catholic crusaders to replace the Orthodox Byzantine Empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gregory|2010|pp=330–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hagia Sophia was converted to a Catholic church in 1204. The Byzantine Empire was restored, albeit weakened, in 1261.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gregory|2010|p=340}}&lt;/ref&gt; Constantinople's churches, defenses, and basic services were in disrepair,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gregory|2010|pp=341–2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its population had dwindled to a hundred thousand from half a million during the 8th century.{{efn|name=pop-figures}} After the reconquest of 1261, however some of the city's monuments were restored, and some, like the two Deisis mosaics in Hagia Sofia and Kariye, were created.

Various economic and military policies instituted by [[Andronikos II Palaiologos|Andronikos II]], such as the reduction of military forces, weakened the empire and left it vulnerable to attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Reinert|2002|pp=258–60}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid-14th-century, the [[Ottoman Turks]] began a strategy of gradually taking smaller towns and cities, cutting off Constantinople's supply routes and strangling it slowly.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Baynes|1949|p=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 29 May 1453, after an eight-week siege (during which the last Roman emperor, [[Constantine XI Palaiologos|Constantine XI]], was killed), [[Sultan]] [[Mehmed II]] "the Conqueror" [[Fall of Constantinople|captured Constantinople]] and declared it the new capital of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. Hours later, the sultan rode to the Hagia Sophia and summoned an imam to proclaim the [[Shahada|Islamic creed]], converting the grand cathedral into an imperial mosque due to the city's refusal to surrender peacefully.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gregory|2010|pp=394–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mehmed declared himself as the new "Kaysar-i Rûm" (the [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]] equivalent of [[Caesar (title)|Caesar]] of Rome) and the Ottoman state was reorganized into an empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Béhar|1999|p=38}}; {{harvnb|Bideleux|Jeffries|1998|p=71}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the conquest of Constantinople, Mehmed II immediately set out to revitalize the city, by then sometimes called Istanbul. He urged the return of those who had fled the city during the siege, and resettled Muslims, Jews, and Christians from other parts of Anatolia. He demanded that five thousand households needed to be transferred to Constantinople by September.&lt;ref&gt;Inalcik, Halil. "The Policy of Mehmed II toward the Greek Population of Istanbul and the Byzantine Buildings of the City." Dumbarton Oaks Papers 23, (1969): 229–249. p. 236&lt;/ref&gt; From all over the Islamic empire, prisoners of war and deported people were sent to the city: these people were called "Sürgün" in Turkish ({{lang-gr|σουργούνιδες}}).&lt;ref&gt;Müller-Wiener, Wolfgang (1977).

Mehmed II also repaired the city's damaged infrastructure, including the whole [[Valens Aqueduct#Ottoman period|water system]], began to build the [[Grand Bazaar, Istanbul|Grand Bazaar]], and constructed [[Topkapı Palace]], the sultan's official residence.&lt;ref name="holale307"&gt;{{harvnb|Holt|Lambton|Lewis|1977|pp=307}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the transfer of the capital from [[Edirne]] (formerly Adrianople) to Constantinople, the new state was declared as the successor and continuation of the Roman Empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tarasov|Milner-Gulland|2004|p=121}}; {{harvnb|El-Cheikh|2004|p=22}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ottomans quickly transformed the city from a bastion of Christianity to a symbol of [[Islamic culture]]. [[Waqf|Religious foundations]] were established to fund the construction of ornate [[Mosques commissioned by the Ottoman dynasty|imperial mosques]], often adjoined by schools, hospitals, and public baths.&lt;ref name="holale307"/&gt; The [[Ottoman Dynasty]] claimed the status of [[caliphate]] in 1517, with Constantinople remaining the capital of this [[Ottoman Caliphate|last caliphate]] for four centuries.&lt;ref name="maag1145"/&gt; [[Suleiman the Magnificent]]'s reign from 1520 to 1566 was a period of especially great artistic and architectural achievement; chief architect [[Mimar Sinan]] designed several iconic buildings in the city, while Ottoman arts of [[İznik pottery|ceramics]], [[stained glass]], [[Islamic calligraphy|calligraphy]], and [[Ottoman miniature|miniature]] flourished.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Holt|Lambton|Lewis|1977|pp=735–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The population of Constantinople was 570,000 by the end of the 18th century.&lt;ref name="chfo"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chandler|first1=Tertius|last2=Fox|first2=Gerald|title=3000 Years of Urban Growth|year=1974|publisher=Academic Press|location=London|isbn=978-0-12-785109-9|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A period of rebellion at the start of the 19th century led to the rise of the progressive Sultan [[Mahmud II]] and eventually to the ''[[Tanzimat]]'' period, which produced political reforms and allowed new technology to be introduced to the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shaw|Shaw|1977|pp=4–6, 55}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bridges across the [[Golden Horn]] were constructed during this period,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Çelik|1993|pp=87–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Constantinople was connected to the rest of the European railway network in the 1880s.&lt;ref name="ha251"&gt;{{harvnb|Harter|2005|p=251}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern facilities, such as a water supply network, electricity, telephones, and trams, were gradually introduced to Constantinople over the following decades, although later than to other European cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shaw|Shaw|1977|pp=230, 287, 306}}&lt;/ref&gt; The modernization efforts were not enough to forestall the [[decline of the Ottoman Empire]].

Sultan [[Abdul Hamid II]] was deposed with the [[Young Turk Revolution]] in 1908 and the [[General Assembly of the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Parliament]], closed since [[First Constitutional Era|14 February 1878]], was reopened 30 years later on 23 July 1908, which marked the beginning of the [[Second Constitutional Era]].&lt;ref name=tarihiolaylar&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tarihiolaylar.com/tarihi-olaylar/meclis-i-mebusan-mebuslar-meclisi-991|title=Meclis-i Mebusan (Mebuslar Meclisi) |publisher=Tarihi Olaylar}}&lt;/ref&gt; A series of wars in the early 20th century, such as the [[Italo-Turkish War]] (1911–1912) and the [[Balkan Wars]] (1912–1913), plagued the ailing empire's capital and resulted in the [[1913 Ottoman coup d'état]], which brought the regime of the [[Three Pashas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Çelik|1993|p=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ottoman Empire joined [[World War I]] (1914–1918) on the side of the [[Central Powers]] and was ultimately defeated. The [[deportation of Armenian intellectuals on 24 April 1915]] was among the major events which marked the start of the [[Armenian Genocide]] during WWI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Freedman|first1=Jeri|title=The Armenian genocide|date=2009|publisher=Rosen Pub.

Marc Baer, University of California, Irvine.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Armistice of Mudros]] was signed on 30 October 1918 and the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] [[occupation of Constantinople|occupied Constantinople]] on 13 November 1918. The [[General Assembly of the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Parliament]] was dissolved by the Allies on 11 April 1920 and the Ottoman delegation led by [[Damat Ferid Pasha]] was forced to sign the [[Treaty of Sèvres]] on 10 August 1920.

Following the [[Turkish War of Independence]] (1919–1922), the [[Grand National Assembly of Turkey]] in [[Ankara]] abolished the [[Sultanate]] on 1 November 1922, and the last [[List of sultans of the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Sultan]], [[Mehmed VI]], was declared ''[[150 personae non gratae of Turkey|persona non grata]]''. Leaving aboard the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[warship]] [[HMS Malaya|HMS ''Malaya'']] on 17 November 1922, he went into exile and died in [[Sanremo]], [[Italy]], on 16 May 1926. The [[Treaty of Lausanne]] was signed on 24 July 1923, and the [[occupation of Constantinople]] ended with the departure of the last forces of the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] from the city on 4 October 1923.&lt;ref name=liberation-of-istanbul&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sozcu.com.tr/2017/gundem/6-ekim-istanbulun-kurtulusu-2039060/|title=6 Ekim İstanbul'un Kurtuluşu|publisher=[[Sözcü]]|date=6 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Turkish forces of the Ankara government, commanded by [[Şükrü Naili Gökberk|Şükrü Naili Pasha]] (3rd Corps), entered the city with a ceremony on 6 October 1923, which has been marked as the ''Liberation Day'' of Istanbul ([[Turkish language|Turkish]]: ''İstanbul'un Kurtuluşu'') and is commemorated every year on its anniversary.&lt;ref name=liberation-of-istanbul/&gt; On 29 October 1923 the Grand National Assembly of Turkey declared the establishment of the Turkish Republic, with Ankara as its capital. [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]] became the Republic's first [[President of Turkey|President]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Landau|1984|p=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ankara]] was selected as Turkey's capital in 1923 to distance the new, secular republic from its Ottoman history.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dumper|Stanley|2007|p=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to historian Philip Mansel:
: after the departure of the dynasty in 1925, from being the most international city in Europe, Constantinople became one of the most nationalistic....Unlike Vienna, Constantinople turned its back on the past. Even its name was changed. Constantinople was dropped because of its Ottoman and international associations. From 1926 the post office only accepted Istanbul; it appeared more Turkish and was used by most Turks.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Mansel. ''Constantinople: city of the world's Desire, 1453-1924'' (2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

From the late 1940s and early 1950s, Istanbul underwent great structural change, as new public squares, boulevards, and avenues were constructed throughout the city, sometimes at the expense of historical buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Keyder|1999|pp=11–2, 34–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The population of Istanbul began to rapidly increase in the 1970s, as people from Anatolia migrated to the city to find employment in the many new factories that were built on the outskirts of the sprawling metropolis. This sudden, sharp rise in the city's population caused a large demand for housing, and many previously outlying villages and forests became engulfed into the [[metropolitan area]] of Istanbul.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Efe|Cürebal|2011|pp=718–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Istanbul is located in north-western [[Turkey]] within the [[Marmara Region]] on a total area of {{convert|5343|km2|sqmi|sp=us}}.{{efn|name=city-area|Sources have provided conflicting figures on the area of Istanbul. The most authoritative source on this figure ought to be the Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality (MMI), but the English version of its website suggests a few figures for this area. One page states that "Each MM is sub-divided into District Municipalities ("DM") ''of which there are 27 in Istanbul''" [emphasis added] with a total area of {{convert|1538.9|km2|sqmi|sp=us}}.&lt;ref name="mmi-districts"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibb.gov.tr/en-US/Organization/Jurisdiction/Pages/Districts.aspx |title=Districts |publisher=Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality |accessdate=21 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Municipal History page appears to be the most explicit and most updated, saying that in 2004, "Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality's jurisdiction was enlarged to cover all the area within the provincial limits". It also states a 2008 law merged the [[Eminönü]] district into the [[Fatih]] district (a point that is not reflected in the previous source) and increased the number of districts in Istanbul to 39.&lt;ref name="mmi-history"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibb.gov.tr/en-US/Organization/MunicipalHistory/Pages/AnaSayfa.aspx |title=History of Local Governance in Istanbul |publisher=Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality |accessdate=21 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; That total area, as corroborated on the Turkish version of the MMI website,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibb.gov.tr/tr-TR/kurumsal/Pages/IlceveIlkKademe.aspx |title=İstanbul İl ve İlçe Alan Bilgileri |publisher=Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality |accessdate=20 June 2010 |language=Turkish |trans-title=Istanbul Province and District Area Information}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a Jurisdiction page on the English site&lt;ref name="mmi-jurisdiction"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibb.gov.tr/en-US/Organization/Jurisdiction/Pages/AnaSayfa.aspx |title=Jurisdiction |publisher=Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality |accessdate=21 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; is {{convert|5343|km2|sqmi|sp=us}}.}} The [[Bosphorus]], which connects the [[Sea of Marmara]] to the [[Black Sea]], divides the city into a European, [[Thrace|Thracian]] side—comprising the historic and economic centers—and an Asian, [[Anatolia]]n side. The city is further divided by the [[Golden Horn]], a natural harbor bounding the peninsula where the former Byzantium and Constantinople were founded. The confluence of the Sea of Marmara, the Bosphorus, and the Golden Horn at the heart of present-day Istanbul has deterred attacking forces for thousands of years and remains a prominent feature of the city's landscape.&lt;ref name="gr63"/&gt;

Following [[seven hills of Rome|the model of Rome]], the historic peninsula is said to be characterized by [[Seven hills of Istanbul|seven hills]], each topped by imperial mosques. The easternmost of these hills is the site of Topkapı Palace on the [[Sarayburnu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.istanbul.gov.tr/Default.aspx?pid=294|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090517063239/http://english.istanbul.gov.tr/Default.aspx?pid=294 |archivedate=17 May 2009 |publisher=Governorship of Istanbul|title=Istanbul from a Bird's Eye View|accessdate=13 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rising from the opposite side of the Golden Horn is another, conical hill, where the modern Beyoğlu district is situated. Because of the topography, buildings in Beyoğlu were once constructed with the help of terraced retaining walls, and roads were laid out in the form of steps.&lt;ref name="topo"/&gt; [[Üsküdar]] on the Asian side exhibits similarly hilly characteristics, with the terrain gradually extending down to the Bosphorus coast, but the landscape in Şemsipaşa and Ayazma is more abrupt, akin to a [[promontory]]. The highest point in Istanbul is [[Camlica Hill|Çamlıca Hill]], with an altitude of {{convert|288|m|ft|sp=us}}.&lt;ref name="topo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kultur.gov.tr/EN,33069/the-topography-of-istanbul.html|publisher=Republic of Turkey Ministry of Culture and Tourism|title=The Topography of İstanbul|accessdate=19 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The northern half of Istanbul has a higher mean elevation compared to the south coast, with locations surpassing {{convert|200|m|ft|sp=us}}, and some coasts with steep cliffs resembling [[fjord]]s, especially around the northern end of the Bosphorus, where it opens up to the Black Sea.

Istanbul is situated near the [[North Anatolian Fault]], close to the boundary between the [[African Plate|African]] and [[Eurasian Plate|Eurasian]] Plates. This fault zone, which runs from northern Anatolia to the Sea of Marmara, has been responsible for several deadly earthquakes throughout the city's history. Among the most devastating of these seismic events was the [[1509 Istanbul earthquake|1509 earthquake]], which caused a tsunami that broke over the walls of the city and killed more than 10,000 people. More recently, in 1999, [[1999 İzmit earthquake|an earthquake]] with its epicenter in nearby [[İzmit]] left 18,000 people dead, including 1,000 people in Istanbul's suburbs. The people of Istanbul remain concerned that an even more catastrophic seismic event may be in the city's near future, as thousands of structures recently built to accommodate Istanbul's rapidly increasing population may not have been constructed properly.&lt;ref name="dis-awaits"&gt;{{cite news|last=Revkin|first=Andrew C.|title=Disaster Awaits Cities in Earthquake Zones|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/25/science/earth/25quake.html|work=The New York Times|date=24 February 2010|accessdate=13 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seismologists say the risk of a 7.6-[[Moment magnitude scale|magnitude]] or greater earthquake striking Istanbul by 2030 is more than {{nowrap|60 percent}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1126/science.288.5466.661|last1=Parsons|first1=Tom|last2=Toda|first2=Shinji|last3=Stein|first3=Ross S.|last4=Barka|first4=Aykut|last5=Dieterich|first5=James H.|year=2000|title=Heightened Odds of Large Earthquakes Near Istanbul: An Interaction-Based Probability Calculation|journal=Science|pmid=10784447|location=Washington, D.C.|volume=288|issue=5466|pages=661–5|ref=harv|bibcode=2000Sci...288..661P}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Traynor|first=Ian|title=A Disaster Waiting to Happen – Why a Huge Earthquake Near Istanbul Seems Inevitable|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/dec/09/turkey.naturaldisasters|work=The Guardian |location=UK |date=9 December 2006|accessdate=13 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The climate in the populated areas of the city to the south, located on the [[Sea of Marmara]], is warmer, drier and less affected by humidity.&lt;ref name="efcu716"&gt;{{harvnb|Efe|Cürebal|2011|pp=716–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The annual precipitation in the northern half can be twice as much (Bahçeköy, 1166.6&amp;nbsp;mm), than it is in the southern, Marmara coast (Florya 635.0&amp;nbsp;mm).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://e-dergi.marmara.edu.tr/marucog/article/view/1012000723/1012000620/|title=COMPARISONS OF ANNUAL MEANPRECIPITATION GRIDDED AND STATION DATA: AN EXAMPLE FROM ISTANBUL, TURKEY Yıllık Ortalama Gridlenmiş Yağış Verisi ve İstasyon Yağış Verisinin Karşılaştırılması, İstanbul Örneği – USTAOĞLU – Marmara Coğrafya Dergisi|work=marmara.edu.tr|accessdate=12 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a significant difference between annual mean temperatures on the north and south coasts as well, Bahçeköy {{convert|12.8|C|F|abbr=on}}, Kartal {{convert|15.03|C|F|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://evladifathan.blogspot.com.tr/2009/05/bahcekoy-orman-isletme-mudurlugu.html|title=HÜSNÜ YAZICI YAZDIĞI KONULAR|author=belgrat|work=blogspot.com.tr|accessdate=12 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parts of the province that are away from both seas exhibit considerable continental influences, with much more pronounced night-day and summer-winter temperature differences.

[[File:Topkapı - 01.jpg|thumb|right|A view of [[Topkapı Palace]] from across the [[Golden Horn]], with the [[Prince Islands]] in the background.]]
The [[Fatih]] district, which was named after Sultan [[Mehmed II|Mehmed the Conqueror]] ([[Turkish language|Turkish]]: ''Fatih Sultan Mehmed''), corresponds to what was, until the Ottoman conquest in 1453, the whole of the city of [[Constantinople]] (today is the capital district and called the ''historic peninsula'' of Istanbul) on the southern shore of the [[Golden Horn]], across the medieval [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] citadel of [[Galata]] on the northern shore. The Genoese fortifications in Galata were largely demolished in the 19th century, leaving only the [[Galata Tower]], to make way for the northward expansion of the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Çelik|1993|pp=70, 169}}&lt;/ref&gt; Galata ([[Karaköy]]) is today a quarter within the [[Beyoğlu]] (Pera) district, which forms Istanbul's commercial and entertainment center and includes [[İstiklal Avenue]] and [[Taksim Square]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Çelik|1993|p=127}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dolmabahçe Palace]], the seat of government during the late Ottoman period, is located in the [[Beşiktaş]] district on the European shore of the [[Bosphorus]] strait, to the north of Beyoğlu. The [[Sublime Porte]] (''Bâb-ı Âli''), which became a [[metonym]] for the Ottoman government, was originally used to describe the Imperial Gate (''Bâb-ı Hümâyûn'') at the outermost courtyard of the [[Topkapı Palace]]; but after the 18th century, the ''Sublime Porte'' (or simply ''Porte'') began to refer to the gate of the ''Sadrazamlık'' (Prime Ministry) compound in the [[Cağaloğlu]] quarter near Topkapı Palace, where the offices of the [[Sadrazam]] ([[Grand Vizier]]) and other [[Vizier]]s were located, and where foreign diplomats were received. The former village of [[Ortaköy]] is situated within Beşiktaş and gives its name to the [[Ortaköy Mosque]] on the Bosphorus, near the [[Bosphorus Bridge]]. Lining both the European and Asian shores of the Bosphorus are the historic ''[[yalı]]s'', luxurious chalet mansions built by Ottoman aristocrats and elites as summer homes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/10/29/arts/antiques-for-turks-art-to-mark-700th-year.html|last=Moonan|first=Wendy|work=The New York Times|title=For Turks, Art to Mark 700th Year|date=29 October 1999|accessdate=4 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Farther inland, outside the city's inner ring road, are [[Levent]] and [[Maslak]], Istanbul's main business districts.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Oxford Business Group|2009|p=105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Yağlıkçı Hacı Reşit Bey and Prenses Rukiye Yalısı on the Bosphorus, Istanbul, Turkey 001.jpg|thumb|left|Originally outside the city, ''[[yalı]]'' residences along the [[Bosphorus]] are now homes in some of Istanbul's elite neighborhoods.|alt=Two- and three-story colored houses with docks and balconies, built directly on the edge of the water]]
During the Ottoman period, [[Üsküdar]] and [[Kadıköy]] were outside the scope of urban Istanbul, serving as tranquil outposts with seaside ''yalıs'' and gardens. But in the second half of the 20th century, the Asian side experienced major urban growth; the late development of this part of the city led to better infrastructure and tidier urban planning when compared with most other residential areas in the city.&lt;ref name="wctr281"/&gt; Much of the Asian side of the Bosphorus functions as a suburb of the economic and commercial centers in European Istanbul, accounting for a third of the city's population but only a quarter of its employment.&lt;ref name="wctr281"/&gt; As a result of Istanbul's exponential growth in the 20th century, a significant portion of the city is composed of ''[[gecekondu]]s'' (literally "built overnight"), referring to illegally constructed squatter buildings.&lt;ref name="kar7896"&gt;{{harvnb|Karpat|1976|pp=78–96}}&lt;/ref&gt; At present, some ''gecekondu'' areas are being gradually demolished and replaced by modern mass-housing compounds.&lt;ref name="yavuz"&gt;{{cite news|last=Yavuz |first=Ercan |url=http://www.todayszaman.com/newsDetail_getNewsById.action?load=detay&amp;link=177450&amp;bolum=103 |work=Today's Zaman |title=Gov't launches plan to fight illegal construction |date=8 June 2009 |accessdate=20 December 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120120204750/http://www.todayszaman.com/newsDetail_getNewsById.action?load=detay&amp;link=177450&amp;bolum=103 |archivedate=20 January 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, large scale [[gentrification]] and [[urban renewal]] projects have been taking place,&lt;ref name="AtkinsonBridge2005"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Rowland Atkinson|author2=Gary Bridge|title=Gentrification In A Global Context: The New Urban Colonialism|url={{Google books|s_Z8dxsXWxQC|page=PA123|keywords=|text=|plainurl=yes}}|accessdate=6 May 2013|year=2005|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-32951-4|pages=123–}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as the one in [[Tarlabaşı]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Poor but Proud Istanbul Neighborhood Faces Gentrification |author=Jessica Bourque |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/05/world/middleeast/05iht-m05-turkey-tarlabasi.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=4 July 2012 |accessdate=6 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; some of these projects, like the one in [[Sulukule]], have faced criticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Forced gentrification plan spells end for old Roma district in Istanbul |author=Robert Tait |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jul/22/roma.turkey |newspaper=The Guardian |date=22 July 2008 |accessdate=6 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Turkish government also has ambitious plans for an expansion of the city west and northwards on the European side in conjunction with plans for a [[Istanbul New Airport|third airport]]; the new parts of the city will include four different settlements with specified urban functions, housing 1.5 million people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=New city construction to begin in six months |url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/new-city-construction-to-begin-in-six-months.aspx?nid=41622&amp;pageID=238 |newspaper=Hurriyet Daily News |date=22 February 2013 |accessdate=6 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Istanbul does not have a primary urban park, but it has several green areas. [[Gülhane Park]] and [[Yıldız Park]] were originally included within the grounds of two of Istanbul's palaces—[[Topkapı Palace]] and [[Yıldız Palace]]—but they were repurposed as public parks in the early decades of the Turkish Republic.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Boyar|Fleet|2010|p=247}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another park, [[Fethi Paşa Korusu]], is situated on a hillside adjacent to the [[Bosphorus Bridge]] in Anatolia, opposite Yıldız Palace in Europe. Along the European side, and close to the [[Fatih Sultan Mehmet Bridge]], is [[Emirgan Park]], which was known as the ''Kyparades'' ([[Cypress]] Forest) during the Byzantine period. In the Ottoman period, it was first granted to [[Lord Chancellor|Nişancı]] Feridun Ahmed Pasha in the 16th century, before being granted by Sultan [[Murad IV]] to the [[Safavid dynasty|Safavid]] [[Emir]] Gûne Han in the 17th century, hence the name ''Emirgan''. The {{convert|47|ha|acre|adj=on}} park was later owned by [[Khedive]] [[Isma'il Pasha|Ismail Pasha]] of [[Khedivate of Egypt|Ottoman Egypt and Sudan]] in the 19th century. Emirgan Park is known for its diversity of plants and an annual [[tulip]] festival is held there since 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Taylor|2007|p=241}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Justice and Development Party (Turkey)|AKP]] government's decision to replace [[Taksim Gezi Park]] with a replica of the Ottoman era [[Taksim Military Barracks]] (which was transformed into the [[Taksim Stadium]] in 1921, before being demolished in 1940 for building Gezi Park) sparked a series of [[Gezi Park protests|nationwide protests in 2013]] covering a wide range of issues. Popular during the summer among Istanbulites is [[Belgrad Forest]], spreading across {{convert|5500|ha|acre|adj=off}} at the northern edge of the city. The forest originally supplied water to the city and remnants of reservoirs used during Byzantine and Ottoman times survive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kultur.gov.tr/EN/belge/2-14846/water-supply-systems-reservoirs-charity-and-free-founta-.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101119053754/http://www.kultur.gov.tr/EN/belge/2-14846/water-supply-systems-reservoirs-charity-and-free-founta-.html|archivedate=19 November 2010 |publisher=Republic of Turkey Ministry of Culture and Tourism|title=Water Supply Systems, Reservoirs, Charity and Free Fountains, Turkish Baths|accessdate=29 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Time Out Guides|2010|p=212}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Architecture===
{{Main|Architecture of Istanbul}}
[[File:Turkey-3019 - Hagia Sophia (2216460729).jpg|thumb|left|Originally a church, later a mosque, and today (since 1935) a museum, the 6th-century [[Hagia Sophia]] (532–537) in Istanbul (Constantinople) built by the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] emperor [[Justinian I|Justinian the Great]] was the largest cathedral ever constructed in the world for nearly a thousand years, until the completion of the [[Seville Cathedral]] (1507) in [[Spain]].|alt=A reddish building topped by a large dome and surrounded by smaller domes and four towers]]

Istanbul is primarily known for its Byzantine and Ottoman architecture, but its buildings reflect the various peoples and empires that have previously ruled the city. Examples of Genoese and Roman architecture remain visible in Istanbul alongside their Ottoman counterparts. Nothing of the [[Ancient Greek architecture|architecture of the classical Greek period]] has survived, but [[Ancient Roman architecture|Roman architecture]] has proved to be more durable. [[Obelisk of Theodosius|The obelisk]] erected by [[Theodosius I|Theodosius]] in the [[Hippodrome of Constantinople]] is still visible in Sultanahmet Square, and a section of the [[Valens Aqueduct]], constructed in the late 4th century, stands relatively intact at the western edge of the Fatih district.&lt;ref name="coaot"&gt;{{harvnb|Chamber of Architects of Turkey|2006|pp=80, 118}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Column of Constantine]], erected in 330 CE to mark the new Roman capital, stands not far from the Hippodrome.&lt;ref name="coaot"/&gt;

[[File:Sultan Ahmed Mosque Istanbul Turkey retouched.jpg|thumb|left|Completed in 1616, the [[Sultan Ahmed Mosque]] is popularly known as the ''Blue Mosque'' due to the blue [[İznik tiles]] which adorn its interior.&lt;ref name=bluemosque&gt;{{cite web|title=Blue Mosque|url=http://www.bluemosque.co/|website=bluemosque.co|access-date=12 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Early [[Byzantine architecture]] followed the classical Roman model of domes and arches, but improved upon these elements, as in the [[Little Hagia Sophia|Church of the Saints Sergius and Bacchus]]. The oldest surviving Byzantine church in Istanbul—albeit in ruins—is the [[Monastery of Stoudios]] (later converted into the Imrahor Mosque), which was built in 454.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chamber of Architects of Turkey|2006|p=176}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the recapture of Constantinople in 1261, the Byzantines enlarged two of the most important churches extant, [[Chora Church]] and [[Pammakaristos Church]]. The pinnacle of Byzantine architecture, and one of Istanbul's most iconic structures, is the [[Hagia Sophia]]. Topped by a dome {{convert|31|m|ft|sp=us}} in diameter,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gregory|2010|p=138}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Hagia Sophia stood as the world's largest cathedral for centuries, and was later converted into a mosque and, as it stands now, a museum.&lt;ref name="klwa171"/&gt;

Among the oldest surviving examples of [[Ottoman architecture]] in Istanbul are the [[Anadoluhisarı]] and [[Rumelihisarı]] fortresses, which assisted the Ottomans during their siege of the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Freely|2000|p=283}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the next four centuries, the Ottomans made an indelible impression on the skyline of Istanbul, building towering mosques and ornate palaces. The largest palace, [[Topkapı Palace|Topkapı]], includes a diverse array of architectural styles, from [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] inside the [[Imperial Harem|Harem]], to its [[neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]] style [[Enderun School|Enderûn Library]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Necipoğlu|1991|pp=180, 136–137}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Mosques commissioned by the Ottoman dynasty|imperial mosques]] include [[Fatih Mosque]], [[Bayezid Mosque]], [[Yavuz Selim Mosque]], [[Süleymaniye Mosque]], [[Sultan Ahmed Mosque]] (the Blue Mosque), and [[New Mosque (Istanbul)|Yeni Mosque]], all of which were built at the peak of the Ottoman Empire, in the 16th and 17th centuries. In the following centuries, and especially after the ''[[Tanzimat]]'' reforms, Ottoman architecture was supplanted by European styles.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Çelik|1993|p=159}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of which is the imperial [[Nuruosmaniye Mosque]]. Areas around [[İstiklal Avenue]] were filled with grand European embassies and rows of buildings in Neoclassical, [[Renaissance Revival architecture|Renaissance Revival]] and [[Art Nouveau]] styles, which went on to influence the architecture of a variety of structures in Beyoğlu—including churches, stores, and theaters—and official buildings such as [[Dolmabahçe Palace]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Çelik|1993|pp=133–34, 141}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Administration==
{{Main|List of districts of Istanbul|List of neighbourhoods of Istanbul}}
[[File:Istanbul location districts.svg|right|thumb|upright=1.55|Istanbul's districts extend far from the city center, along the full length of the Bosphorus (with the Black Sea at the top and the Sea of Marmara at the bottom of the map).|alt=A map depicting districts, squeezed between two bodies of water; farther districts are very large compared to those clustered in the center.]]

Since 2004, the municipal boundaries of Istanbul have been coincident with the boundaries of its province.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Büyükşehir Belediyesi Kanunu|trans-title=Metropolitan Municipal Law|url=http://www.tbmm.gov.tr/kanunlar/k5216.html|accessdate=30 November 2010|quote=Bu Kanunun yürürlüğe girdiği tarihte; büyükşehir belediye sınırları, İstanbul ve Kocaeli ilinde, il mülkî sınırıdır. (On the date this law goes in effect, the metropolitan city boundaries, in the provinces of İstanbul and Kocaeli, are those of the province.)|work=Türkiye Büyük Millet Meclisi|date=10 July 2004|language=Turkish}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city, considered capital of [[Istanbul Province]], is administered by the Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality (MMI), which oversees the [[List of districts of Istanbul|39 districts]] of the city-province.{{efn|name=city-area}}

The current city structure can be traced back to the ''Tanzimat'' period of reform in the 19th century, before which [[qadi|Islamic judges]] and imams led the city under the auspices of the [[Grand Vizier]]. Following the model of French cities, this religious system was replaced by a mayor and a citywide council composed of representatives of the confessional groups (''[[millet (Ottoman Empire)|millet]]'') across Istanbul. Beyoğlu was the first area of the city to have its own director and council, with members instead being longtime residents of the neighborhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gül|2012|pp=43–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Laws enacted after the [[Ottoman constitution of 1876]] aimed to expand this structure across the city, imitating the twenty [[arrondissements of Paris]], but they were not fully implemented until 1908, when Istanbul was declared a province with nine constituent districts.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Çelik|1993|pp=42–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kapucu|Palabiyik|2008|p=145}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system continued beyond the founding of the Turkish Republic, with the province renamed a ''belediye'' (municipality), but the municipality was disbanded in 1957.&lt;ref name="mmi-history"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Taşan-Kok|2004|p=87}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Adalar 5536.jpg|thumb|left|Statue of [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk|Atatürk]] in [[Büyükada]], the largest of the [[Prince Islands]] to the southeast of Istanbul, which collectively form the [[Adalar|Adalar (''Isles'')]] district of [[Istanbul Province]].]]

Small settlements adjacent to major population centers in Turkey, including Istanbul, were merged into their respective primary cities during the early 1980s, resulting in metropolitan municipalities.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wynn|1984|p=188}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Taşan-Kok|2004|pp=87–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main decision-making body of the Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality is the Municipal Council, with members drawn from district councils.

The Municipal Council is responsible for citywide issues, including managing the budget, maintaining civic infrastructure, and overseeing museums and major cultural centers.&lt;ref name="kapa1535"&gt;{{harvnb|Kapucu|Palabiyik|2008|pp=153–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the government operates under a "powerful mayor, weak council" approach, the council's leader—the metropolitan mayor—has the authority to make swift decisions, often at the expense of transparency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Erder|first=Sema|title=Local Governance in Istanbul|date=November 2009|series=Urban Age|journal=Istanbul: City of Intersections|location=London|page=46|url=http://v0.urban-age.net/publications/newspapers/istanbul/media/UrbanAgeIstanbulNewspaper_en.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=16 July 2012|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Municipal Council is advised by the Metropolitan Executive Committee, although the Committee also has limited power to make decisions of its own.&lt;ref name="kapa156"&gt;{{harvnb|Kapucu|Palabiyik|2008|p=156}}&lt;/ref&gt; All representatives on the Committee are appointed by the metropolitan mayor and the Council, with the mayor—or someone of his or her choosing—serving as head.&lt;ref name="kapa156"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mmi-mec"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibb.gov.tr/en-US/Organization/Encumen/Pages/AnaSayfa.aspx|publisher=Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality|title=Metropolitan Executive Committee|accessdate=21 December 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120102011328/http://www.ibb.gov.tr/en-US/Organization/Encumen/Pages/AnaSayfa.aspx|archivedate=2 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Taksim Square 2012.jpg|thumb|A view of [[Taksim Square]] with the [[Republic Monument]] (1928) designed by Italian sculptor [[Pietro Canonica]].]]

District councils are chiefly responsible for waste management and construction projects within their respective districts. They each maintain their own budgets, although the metropolitan mayor reserves the right to review district decisions. One-fifth of all district council members, including the district mayors, also represent their districts in the Municipal Council.&lt;ref name="kapa1535"/&gt; All members of the district councils and the Municipal Council, including the metropolitan mayor, are elected to five-year terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kapucu|Palabiyik|2008|pp=155–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Representing the [[Justice and Development Party (Turkey)|Justice and Development Party]], [[Mevlüt Uysal]] has been the [[List of mayors of Istanbul|Mayor of Istanbul]] since September 28, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ibb.istanbul/en/SitePage/Index/86|title=The Mayor|publisher=Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality|accessdate=12 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality and Istanbul Province having equivalent jurisdictions, few responsibilities remain for the provincial government. Similar to the MMI, the Istanbul Special Provincial Administration has a governor, a democratically elected decision-making body—the Provincial Parliament—and an appointed Executive Committee. Mirroring the executive committee at the municipal level, the Provincial Executive Committee includes a secretary-general and leaders of departments that advise the Provincial Parliament.&lt;ref name="mmi-mec"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ioi.gov.tr/index.php?yol=0_1_124 |publisher=Istanbul Special Provincial Administration |title=Organizasyon |trans-title=Organization |accessdate=21 December 2011 |language=Turkish |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111126141113/http://www.ioi.gov.tr/index.php?yol=0_1_124 |archivedate=26 November 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Provincial Administration's duties are largely limited to the building and maintenance of schools, residences, government buildings, and roads, and the promotion of arts, culture, and nature conservation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|2008|p=206}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vasip Şahin]] has been the [[List of Governors of Istanbul Province|Governor of Istanbul Province]] since September 25, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.istanbul.gov.tr/en/governorship-of-istanbul/governor-of-istanbul|title=Governor of Istanbul|publisher=Governorship of Istanbul|accessdate=12 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout most of its history, Istanbul has ranked among the largest cities in the world. By 500 CE, Constantinople had somewhere between 400,000 and 500,000 people, edging out its predecessor, Rome, for [[List of largest cities throughout history|world's largest city]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Morris|2010|p=113}}&lt;/ref&gt; Constantinople jostled with other major historical cities, such as [[Baghdad]], [[Chang'an]], [[Kaifeng]] and [[Merv]] for the position of [[List of largest cities throughout history|world's most populous city]] until the 12th century.

Istanbul experienced especially rapid growth during the second half of the 20th century, with its population increasing tenfold between 1950 and 2000.&lt;ref name="tu224"/&gt; This growth in population comes, in part, from an expansion of city limits—particularly between 1980 and 1985, when the number of Istanbulites nearly doubled.&lt;ref name="mmi-history"/&gt; The remarkable growth was, and still is, largely fueled by migrants from eastern Turkey seeking employment and improved living conditions.

Istanbul has been a cosmopolitan city throughout much of its history, but it has become more homogenized since the end of the Ottoman Empire. The vast majority of people across Turkey, and in Istanbul, are [[Muslim]], and more specifically members of the [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] branch of [[Islam]]. Most Sunnis follow the [[Hanafi]] school of Islamic thought, although approximately {{nowrap|10 percent}} of Sunnis follow the [[Shafi'i]] school. The largest non-Sunni Muslim sect, accounting for {{nowrap|4.5 million}} Turks, is the [[Alevi]]s; a third of all Alevis in the country live in Istanbul.&lt;ref name="konda"/&gt; Mystic movements, like [[Sufism]], were officially banned after the establishment of the Turkish Republic, but they still boast numerous followers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=U.S. Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor|url=https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/irf/2007/90204.htm|publisher=U.S. Department of State|title=Turkey: International Religious Freedom Report 2007|accessdate=27 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Istanbul has voted for the winning party in general elections since 1995. Since 2002, the right-wing [[Justice and Development Party (Turkey)|Justice and Development Party]] (AKP) has won pluralities in every general and local election. The city's electorate has also voted for the AKP government's constitutional reforms proposed during the [[Turkish constitutional referendum, 2007|2007]] and [[Turkish constitutional referendum, 2010|2010]] constitutional referenda. Turkish President and former AKP Prime Minister [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]] was elected [[List of mayors of İstanbul|Mayor of İstanbul]] in the [[Turkish local elections, 1994|1994 local elections]] as the Islamist [[Welfare Party]] candidate with 25.1% of the vote, winning due to a vote split between the mainstream centrist parties. Conservative parties traditionally find support in older districts with high population densities such as [[Bağcılar]], [[Fatih]], [[Sultanbeyli]] and [[Esenler]]. The opposition [[Kemalism|Kemalist]] center-left [[Republican People's Party (Turkey)|Republican People's Party]] (CHP), currently the second major political force in both İstanbul and the country, gets most of its support from more rural districts such as [[Silivri]], [[Çatalca]] and [[Sarıyer]]. Urban districts such as [[Beşiktaş]], [[Bakırköy]], [[Şişli]] and [[Kadıköy]] have returned strong support for the CHP in past elections. The CHP are generally strongest in the west, where newer residential developments are taking place. İstanbul has 39 districts, more than any other [[Provinces of Turkey|province in Turkey]]. Since İstanbul is Turkey's largest city and has usually voted in the same way as the country as a whole, it is largely perceived in Turkish politics that the winning party of an election is essentially decided by İstanbul's electorate.

The incumbent mayor of the city is [[Mevlüt Uysal]] of the AKP, who was elected after the resignation of the previous mayor, [[Kadir Topbaş]]. The leader of the CHP and parliamentary opposition, [[Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu]], ran against Topbaş in the 2009 local elections. He is currently a [[Member of Parliament]] for İstanbul. Between 2007 and 2014, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan was also an MP for İstanbul. For general elections, the city is divided into 3 electoral districts and returns 85 MPs to the [[Grand National Assembly|Turkish parliament]]. In the [[Turkish presidential election, 2014|2014 presidential election]], 49.83% of the city's electorate voted for AKP candidate Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. Although Erdoğan won the most votes in İstanbul, his failure to win above 50% was seen as significant.

Istanbul was historically known as a cultural hub, but its cultural scene stagnated after the Turkish Republic shifted its focus toward [[Ankara]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Göktürk|Soysal|Türeli|2010|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new national government established programs that served to orient Turks toward musical traditions, especially those originating in Europe, but musical institutions and visits by foreign classical artists were primarily centered in the new capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Reisman|2006|p=88}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of Turkey's cultural scene had its roots in Istanbul, and by the 1980s and 1990s Istanbul reemerged globally as a city whose cultural significance is not solely based on its past glory.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Göktürk|Soysal|Türeli|2010|pp=2–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Peramuzesi nighttime.jpg|thumb|left|[[Pera Museum]] in [[Beyoğlu]]]]

By the end of the 19th century, Istanbul had established itself as a regional artistic center, with Turkish, European, and Middle Eastern artists flocking to the city. Despite efforts to make Ankara Turkey's cultural heart, Istanbul had the country's primary institution of art until the 1970s.&lt;ref name="gosotu2213"&gt;{{harvnb|Göktürk|Soysal|Türeli|2010|pp=221–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; When additional universities and art journals were founded in Istanbul during the 1980s, artists formerly based in Ankara moved in.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Göktürk|Soysal|Türeli|2010|pp=223–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Beyoğlu]] has been transformed into the artistic center of the city, with young artists and older Turkish artists formerly residing abroad finding footing there. Modern art museums, including [[İstanbul Modern]], the [[Pera Museum]], [[Sakıp Sabancı Museum]] and [[SantralIstanbul]], opened in the 2000s to complement the exhibition spaces and auction houses that have already contributed to the cosmopolitan nature of the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/12/magazine/istanbul-art-boom-bubble.html|work=The New York Times|title=The Istanbul Art-Boom Bubble|last=Hansen|first=Suzy|date=10 February 2012|accessdate=19 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; These museums have yet to attain the popularity of older museums on the historic peninsula, including the [[Istanbul Archaeology Museums]], which ushered in the era of modern museums in Turkey, and the [[Turkish and Islamic Arts Museum]].&lt;ref name="iv&amp;c"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kultur"/&gt;

Coinciding with this cultural reemergence was the establishment of the Istanbul Festival, which began showcasing a variety of art from Turkey and around the world in 1973. From this flagship festival came the [[International Istanbul Film Festival]] and the [[Istanbul International Jazz Festival]] in the early 1980s. With its focus now solely on music and dance, the Istanbul Festival has been known as the [[Istanbul International Music Festival]] since 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://muzik.iksv.org/en/thefestival/history|publisher=The Istanbul Foundation for Culture and Arts|title=History|accessdate=13 April 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110503092124/http://muzik.iksv.org/en/thefestival/history|archivedate=3 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most prominent of the festivals that evolved from the original Istanbul Festival is the [[Istanbul Biennial]], held every two years since 1987.

Istanbul is famous for its historic [[seafood]] restaurants. Many of the city's most popular and upscale seafood restaurants line the shores of the [[Bosphorus]] (particularly in neighborhoods like [[Ortaköy]], [[Bebek, Istanbul|Bebek]], [[Arnavutköy]], [[Yeniköy, Istanbul|Yeniköy]], [[Beylerbeyi]] and [[Çengelköy]]).

However, following the influx of immigrants from southeastern and eastern Turkey, which began in the 1960s, the foodscape of the city has drastically changed by the end of the century; with influences of Middle Eastern cuisine such as [[kebab]] taking an important place in the food scene. Restaurants featuring foreign cuisines are mainly concentrated in the [[Beyoğlu]], [[Beşiktaş]], [[Şişli]], and [[Kadıköy]] districts.

Istanbul is famous for its [[nightlife]], as well as its historic [[tavern]]s, a signature characteristic of the city for centuries if not millennia.

Istanbul is home to some of Turkey's oldest [[sports club]]s. [[Beşiktaş J.K.|Beşiktaş JK]], established in 1903, is considered the oldest of these sports clubs.

Most state-run radio and television stations are based in Ankara, but Istanbul is the primary hub of Turkish media. The industry has its roots in the former Ottoman capital, where the first Turkish newspaper, ''Takvim-i Vekayi'' (Calendar of Affairs), was published in 1831. The [[Cağaloğlu]] street on which the newspaper was printed, Bâb-ı Âli Street, rapidly became the center of Turkish print media, alongside Beyoğlu across the Golden Horn.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brummett|2000|pp=11, 35, 385–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, Istanbul hosts a wide variety of periodicals. Most nationwide newspapers are based in Istanbul, with simultaneous Ankara and İzmir editions.&lt;ref name="loc-pro"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Turkey.pdf|publisher=The Library of Congress Federal Research Division|title=Country Profile: Turkey|date=August 2008|accessdate=8 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Hürriyet]]'', ''[[Sabah (newspaper)|Sabah]]'', ''[[Posta (newspaper)|Posta]]'' and ''[[Sözcü]]'', the country's top four papers, are all headquartered in Istanbul, boasting more than 275,000 weekly sales each.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medyatava.com/tiraj |title=Tiraj |language=Turkish |work=Medyatava |accessdate=25 December 2016 |date=25 December 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Hürriyet'''s English-language edition, ''[[Hürriyet Daily News]]'', has been printed since 1961, but the English-language ''[[Daily Sabah]]'', first published by ''Sabah'' in 2014, has overtaken it in circulation. Several smaller newspapers, including popular publications like ''[[Cumhuriyet]]'', ''[[Milliyet]]'' and ''[[Habertürk]]'' are also based in Istanbul.&lt;ref name="loc-pro"/&gt; Istanbul also has long-running [[Armenian language]] newspapers, notably the dailies ''[[Marmara (newspaper)|Marmara]]'' and ''[[Jamanak]]'' and the bilingual weekly ''[[Agos]]'' in Armenian and Turkish.

Radio broadcasts in Istanbul date back to 1927, when Turkey's first radio transmission came from atop the Central Post Office in Eminönü. Control of this transmission, and other radio stations established in the following decades, ultimately came under the state-run [[Turkish Radio and Television Corporation]] (TRT), which held a monopoly on radio and television broadcasts between its founding in 1964 and 1990.&lt;ref name="trt-radio"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trt.net.tr/Generic/SayfaTasarimiGoster.aspx?TaslakKodu=bc738c28-15c7-4f98-8793-8d75c4a15cba&amp;dil=en |publisher=The Turkish Radio and Television Corporation |title=TRT – Radio |accessdate=8 May 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110609031759/http://www.trt.net.tr/Generic/SayfaTasarimiGoster.aspx?TaslakKodu=bc738c28-15c7-4f98-8793-8d75c4a15cba&amp;dil=en |archivedate=9 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, TRT runs four national radio stations; these stations have transmitters across the country so each can reach over {{nowrap|90 percent}} of the country's population, but only {{nowrap|Radio 2}} is based in Istanbul. Offering a range of content from educational programming to coverage of sporting events, {{nowrap|Radio 2}} is the most popular radio station in Turkey.&lt;ref name="trt-radio"/&gt; Istanbul's airwaves are the busiest in Turkey, primarily featuring either Turkish-language or English-language content. One of the exceptions, offering both, is [[Açık Radyo]] (94.9 FM).

'''Jessica Delfino''' (born June 8, 1976 in [[Bridgeport, Connecticut]]) is a controversial singer, songwriter, and comedian based in [[New York City]]. Her songs tend to ridicule [[taboos]] and typically include jokes about [[vagina]]s and other sexual or dark topics. In her act, she plays an assortment of instruments including [[guitar]], flying V [[ukulele]] and a rape whistle. She is also an illustrator and attended Philadelphia's Art Institute, as well as the [[University of Maine]]. She has won numerous awards, including beating out [[Flight of the Conchords]] to win the Best Musical Act at the 2005 ECNY awards,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecnyawards.com/history.php "ECNY Awards"] ecnyawards.com, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; and a 2005 Village Voice "Best of" Award,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.villagevoice.com/bestof/2005/award/best-potty-mouthed-guitar-slinging-comedian-492912/ "Best Potty-Mouthed, Guitar-Slinging Comedian - JESSY DELFINO"] The Village Voice, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; in which the [[Village Voice]] declared her to be "fall-off-your-chair hilarious."  She has appeared on ''[[Good Morning America]]''&lt;ref name="The Vagina Dialogue"&gt;[http://phillyedge.com/node/2777 "The Vagina Dialogue"] The Philly Edge, March 6, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; as a finalist in a national comedy competition. She has also won many other competitions, some of them unusual, such as The Stoned Spelling Bee in [[Brooklyn]], the Madagascar Institute's Catholic high
school talent competition&lt;ref&gt;[http://osdir.com/ml/culture.events.nonsense-nyc/2005-06/msg00001.html "nonsense nyc: 6.10 to 6.16"] osdir.com, June, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Arlene's Grocery]] "Gong Show," which later became [[The Gong Show with Dave Attell]] on Comedy Central.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ftl.nypress.com/blogx/display_blog.cfm?bid=79731728 "Meet 'The Bard' and Horny Judges at 'The Gong Show' at Arlene's Grocery"] New York Press, March 7, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music and Performance==
Jessica Delfino's first CD, ''Dirty Folk Rock'' came out in 2004 on the Soundcakes International label.  It received excellent reviews all across the United States, including in ''[[Jane (magazine)|Jane Magazine]]'', ''[[High Times]]'' (Best "unsigned" Act of The Week),&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060318082817/http://www.hightimes.com/ht/home/index.php?page=bow_111004 "HIGH TIMES' UNSIGNED BAND OF THE WEEK"] High Times Magazine,&lt;/ref&gt; ''Arthur Magazine'' (in a fawning review by [[Sonic Youth]]'s [[Thurston Moore]])&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arthurmag.com/store/index.php?ID=23 "Arthur Issue #17"] Arthur Magazine&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[The Onion]]'' (describing her as "Redd Foxx meets Jewel").

Delfino's second CD, ''I Wanna Be Famous'', came out in June, 2008 on the Loudmouth Records label, and was officially the first CD ever to be released by that label.

In September, 2008, she appeared in sold-out performances of her show, ''Dirty Folk Rock'', at the [[Soho Theatre]] in London, for which she received a "Critics Choice" from Time Out London.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timeout.com/london/comedy/events/803452/jessica-delfino.html "Jessica Delfino"] Time Out London&lt;/ref&gt;

Delfino is also known for performing as various unusual characters, including "Bilge Baron" in her histrionic fear-metal band Haunted Pussy&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.HauntedPussy.com "Haunted Pussy"] hauntedpssy.com&lt;/ref&gt; and "T-Top Trans-Am"&lt;ref name="The Vagina Dialogue"/&gt; (her white-trash burlesque act) amongst many others, some of which appear in "Skits N Tits" the monthly sketch comedy show she co-produces in NYC with Diane O'Debra Langan and Steph Sabelli.

===New York Annual Funny Songs Festival===
In June, 2012, Jessica Delfino organized the First Annual Funny Songs Festival in New York City,&lt;ref name="The NY Funny Songs Festival"&gt;[http://www.timeout.com/newyork/comedy/the-ny-funny-songs-festival "The NY Funny Songs Festival"] Time Out New York&lt;/ref&gt; "a four-day event that bills itself as the city’s first comedy music festival,"&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/01/arts/music/new-york-funny-songs-fest-on-lower-east-side.html "Oh, for the Sweet Music of Belly Laughs"] The New York Times&lt;/ref&gt; featuring performers including Rob Paravonian, Jen Kwok, Ben Lerman, Soce the Elemental Wizard, Mindy Raf, Carolyn Castiglia, Myq Kaplan, Micah Sherman, and Jessica Delfino herself, among many others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nyfunnysongs.com/ "1ST ANNUAL NY FUNNY SONGS FEST 2012"] nyfunnysongs.com&lt;/ref&gt;  The festival is scheduled to occur from Thursday, June 7, 2012 through Sunday, June 10, 2012 in Manhattan's Lower East Side neighborhood, and Delfino and the festival were the subject of feature articles in The New York Times, Time Out New York, and numerous other publications.&lt;ref name="The NY Funny Songs Festival"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;

==Politics==
Delfino managed the 2005 mayoral campaign of [[Christopher X. Brodeur]], and she was featured in the 2009 documentary, ''[[The Promise of New York]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1703674/ "Jessica Delfino"] The Internet Movie Database&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writing==
Delfino wrote for [[MTV]]'s [[game show]], ''[[I Bet You Will]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0420413/fullcredits#writers "I Bet You Will (2002)"] imdb.com&lt;/ref&gt;  Later, Morgan Spurlock hired her to write songs for his recent documentary film, ''[[What Would Jesus Buy?]]''.

Delfino writes a blog&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jessydelfino.blogspot.com "Jessy Delfino's Blog"] jessydelfino.blogspot.com&lt;/ref&gt; that [[Wil Wheaton]] called "the funniest thing I've ever read."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wilwheaton.net/mt/archives/001379.php "Slow Tempo In C"] WIL WHEATON dot NET, September 17, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;  She has also been a regular contributor for [[Turner Network Television|TNT]]'s ''[[Saving Grace (TV series)|Saving Grace]]'' [[television series]] blog.

==Controversy==

On December 19, 2006, [[Catholic League (U.S.)|Catholic League]] president [[William A. Donohue]] publicly attacked Delfino's act, asserting that it "provides ammunition" to Muslim terrorists by "harboring a depraved understanding of liberty."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholicleague.org/christmas-season-marked-by-obscenities-2/ "Christmas Season Marked by Obscenities"] Catholic League Press Release, December 19, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  In response, Delfino stated, "I was brought up Catholic, and I was also brought up to believe that it isn't anti-Catholic to celebrate the life-giving and life-nurturing parts of a woman’s body.  I don’t know why William Donohue hates women’s bodies.  I don’t know why he is afraid of refocusing attention on humanity's true source of creation, the mysterious and magical womb.  But I do know that William Donohue is a hypocrite and a bigot, who has publicly made outrageous and highly-offensive anti-Semitic, and now anti-Muslim statements.  And that certainly doesn't make him a better Catholic than I am.  William Donohue does not speak for all Catholics.  He doesn't speak for me."&lt;ref&gt;[http://jessydelfino.blogspot.com/2006/12/for-immediate-release-nyc-artist.html "NYC ARTIST RESPONDS TO CATHOLIC LEAGUE’S ATTACK"] Jessica Delfino's Press release, December 21, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;
 
On the day after [[Google]] announced its purchase of [[YouTube]], YouTube removed a popular video of one of Delfino's songs, the subject of which was that her vagina was magic.  On October 11, 2008, that same video was featured as the top pick on [[playboy.com]]'s "Video Hotlist," and was featured on the main front page of [[playboy.com]]'s Web site.&lt;ref&gt;[http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_rX2gMBHZt-g/SPEs6QWyNLI/AAAAAAAAAec/IRbAMw_SGTU/s1600-h/Picture+3.png "playboy.com"] October 11, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://jessydelfino.blogspot.com/2006/10/my-pussy-is-magic-banned-by-youtube_11.html "'MY PUSSY IS MAGIC' BANNED BY YOUTUBE!!!"] Jessy Delfino's Blog, October 11, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Her siblings included: Robert (a barrister born {{abbreviation|c.|circa}} 1743, a supporter of the radical politician, [[John Wilkes]], who died unmarried c. 1797), Bridget, Jane and [[Sir John Morris, 1st Baronet]]. John followed their father as an industrialist, active in copper-smelting and coal-mining in Swansea, South Wales.&lt;ref name=burkes/&gt; [[Morriston]], in the [[River Tawe|Tawe valley]], is named after her family.

'''Miami-Illinois''' (''Myaamia'' {{IPA-alg|mjɑːmia|}}) is an [[Indigenous languages of the Americas|indigenous]] [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]] language formerly spoken in the United States, primarily in [[Illinois]], [[Missouri]], [[Indiana]], western [[Ohio]] and adjacent areas along the [[Mississippi River]] by the [[Miami people|Miami]] and [[Wea]] as well as the tribes of the [[Illinois Confederation]], including the [[Kaskaskia]], [[Peoria people|Peoria]], [[Tamaroa tribe|Tamaroa]], [[Cahokia]], and [[Mitchigamea]].

Since the 1990s, the [[Miami Tribe of Oklahoma]] has worked to revive it in a joint project with [[Miami University]] in [[Oxford, Ohio]].

==History==
Miami-Illinois is an Algonquian language within the larger [[Algic languages|Algic family]]. The name "Miami-Illinois" is a cover term for a cluster of highly similar dialects, the primary ones being Miami proper, ''Peoria'', ''Wea'', ''Piankeshaw'', and, in the older [[Jesuit missions in North America|Jesuit records]], ''Illinois''. About half of the surviving several hundred speakers were displaced in the 19th century from their territories, eventually settling in northeastern [[Oklahoma]] as the Miami and the Peoria. The remainder of the Miami stayed behind in northern [[Indiana]].

The language was documented in written materials for over 200 years. [[Jacques Gravier]], a Jesuit [[missionary]] who lived among the Kaskaskia tribe in the early 18th century, compiled an extensive and detailed Kaskaskia–French dictionary. Based on an analysis of its handwriting, it appears to have been transcribed by his assistant, [[Jacques Largillier]].

Gravier's dictionary contains nearly 600 pages and 20,000 entries. It is the "most extensive of several manuscripts" which French missionaries made of the Illinois languages.&lt;ref name="oxfordjournals2002"&gt;[http://ijl.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pdf_extract/17/3/325  "Review" of Carl Masthay, ''Kaskaskia Illinois-to-French Dictionary''], Saint Louis: Carl Masthay, 2002, ''International Journal of Lexicography'', 17(3):325–327, Retrieved 2010-3-1&lt;/ref&gt;  The original document is held by [[Trinity College (Connecticut)|Trinity College]] in [[Hartford, Connecticut]]. During the 18th and 19th centuries, the Illinois were subject to extermination by hostile tribes, as well as encroachment by European settlers.  The French abandoned the Kaskaskia mission.

Eventually the surviving Illinois speakers went to the [[Indian Territory]], later [[Oklahoma]] where the group became known as the Peoria. All of the [[Wea]] and [[Piankashaw]] were also forcibly relocated to Oklahoma, where they merged with the [[Peoria tribe|Peoria]]. About half the Miami proper remained in historic territory of present-day Indiana, the other half also being relocated to Oklahoma, eventually settling next to the Peoria. Because of the decline among the number of Miami-Illinois speakers, the language was not studied as extensively as many other Algonquian languages. It was not until 2002 that the manuscript was edited and published, by Carl Masthay.&lt;ref name="oxfordjournals2002"/&gt;

==Phonology==
There is an extensive amount of data on the Miami-Illinois language. The problem with much of the data collected is that little of it was collected by trained phonologists and thus much of it is incomplete or incorrect. David Costa has written extensively on this language, compiling much of this data and correcting it in his book ''The Miami-Illinois Language''.

===Consonants===
The consonants of the Miami-Illinois language are typical to the "Central Algonquian" languages. It contains the voiceless stops and affricate p, t, k, tʃ; voiceless fricatives s, ʃ, h; nasals and liquids m, n, l; and the semivowels w, y.
The linguist David Costa (2003) notes that "the original Proto-Algonquian consonants *p, *t, *k, * tʃ, *s, *ʃ, *h, *m, *n, *w, *j remain largely unchanged." &lt;ref name="Historical Phonology"&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/3519724 "Historical Phonology of Miami Illinois Consonants], Chicago: David Costa, 1991, ''International Journal of American Linguistics'', 57(3):365–393, Retrieved 2011-11-6&lt;/ref&gt;

====Alternations between {{IPA|/s/}} and {{IPA|/ʃ/}}====
There is a small number of words in the Miami-Illinois language that have alternations between {{IPA|/s/}} and {{IPA|/ʃ/}} in their pronunciations. There are also opposite alternations where {{IPA|/ʃ/}} occurs instead of {{IPA|/s/}}. Examples of both of these alternations seem to most prominently show themselves before the vowel {{IPA|/i/}}. Costa (2003) notes these "examples of words showing {{IPA|/ʃ/}} for expected {{IPA|/s/}} follow: /apeehʃia/, /teekweeʃita/, and /neehʃiaani/" &lt;ref name="The Miami-Illinois Language"&gt;Costa, David. 2003. The Miami-Illinois Language . Nebraska: University of Nebraska Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vowels===
Miami-Illinois has four short vowels, {{IPA|/i e a o/}} and four long vowels, {{IPA|/iː eː aː oː/}}.
Costa (2003) notes that "{{IPA|/a/}} is a low non-front vowel however it can also be pronounced as a {{IPA|[ʌ]}} by some speakers. {{IPA|/o/}} is a back round vowel ranging from {{IPA|[o]}} through {{IPA|[ʊ]}} to {{IPA|[u]}}. {{IPA|/e/}} is a non-high front vowel ranging from {{IPA|[æ]}} through {{IPA|[ɛ]}} to {{IPA|[e]}}. Finally, {{IPA|/i/}} is a high front vowel ranging from {{IPA|[ɪ]}} to {{IPA|[i]}}." These differences can occur from speaker to speaker and also from word to word.&lt;ref name="The Miami-Illinois Language"/&gt;

====Strong Syllable Rule====
The most important rule in the phonology of the vowels of the Miami-Illinois language is the [[Iamb (poetry)#Accentual-syllabic use|iambic metrical]] rule, which is referred to by David Costa (2003) as the strong syllable rule (SSR). Syllables in this language are considered either strong or weak depending on whether they occur in an even or odd numbered spot within the word. Counting from left to right, the even numbered syllables are strong and the odd numbered syllables are weak. However, a long vowel is always considered strong and the syllable count is restarted from this point. Anytime a short vowel comes after a long vowel it will always be weak because the count will have started over and it will occur in an even-numbered syllable.&lt;ref name="The Miami-Illinois Language"/&gt;

====Vowel Devoicing Rule====
One important rule for the phonology of Miami-Illinois is called the "Vowel Devoicing Rule." In Miami-Illinois the weak vowels are devoiced any time they occur before a preaspirate. If a short vowel occurs before a preaspirate it will be devoiced if it follows a long vowel. This will also happen if it occurs in an odd-numbered syllable. However, if the vowel is in a strong syllable (or an even-numbered syllable) this rule does not apply. As Costa (2003) states it, "a vowel in an original second syllable can be devoiced only if a long vowel precedes it, thus rendering the vowel odd-numbered for the syllable count." &lt;ref name="The Miami-Illinois Language"/&gt;

====Accents====
Aside from the "Strong Syllable Rule" (Costa, 2003), there is separate system of accenting in the Miami-Illinois language. In this rule, the syllable count begins at the end of the word and goes backwards towards the start of it (unlike the Strong Syllable Rule, which begins at the beginning of the word and goes forwards). Vowels in both weak and strong syllable can be accented. It is most common for words in this language to take accents on their penultimate syllables, though if a weak syllable is subject to devoicing, it can not receive an accent. This shows that the devoicing rule comes before the accent rule.&lt;ref name="The Miami-Illinois Language"/&gt;

==Language revitalization ==
Since the mid-1990s, the [[Miami Tribe of Oklahoma]] has embarked on a [[language revitalization]] program.  Many Miami members have described the language as "sleeping" rather than "extinct" since it was not irretrievably lost.&lt;ref&gt;Leonard, Wesley Y. (2008). "When is an 'Extinct Language' not Extinct? Miami, a Formerly Sleeping Language", in Kendall A. King, Natalie Schilling-Estes, Lyn Fogle, Jia Jackie Lou, and Barbara Soukup (eds.), ''Sustaining Linguistic Diversity: Endangered and Minority Languages and Language Varieties''. Washington, DC: Georgetown University Press, pp. 23–33.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Myaamia Center is a joint venture between the tribe and [[Miami University]].  The Center's mission is..."to advance the research needs of the Miami Tribe of Oklahoma with a focus on myaamia language, culture and history." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | title = Statement of Purpose | publisher = Myaamia Center | year = 2013 | url = http://myaamiacenter.org/?page_id=81  | accessdate = 2013-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

Some language and culture resources include
* a children's book of Miami language and culture;
* an audio CD set with vocabulary, phrases, conversation, and the Miami origin story and a companion text; and
* a compilation of traditional stories from the Miami and Peoria tribes, recorded in the early 20th century when the language's last native speakers were alive.&lt;ref name="sfgate2002"&gt;{{Cite news | last = Shulman | first = Robin  | title = No loss for words: Movement tries to preserve nearly extinct languages| newspaper = [[San Francisco Chronicle]] | date = 2002-06-24

The revitalization effort is based on the work of [[linguist]] David Costa.  Based on his extensive studies, he published ''The Miami-Illinois Language'' in 1994 as his Ph.D. dissertation and as a book in 2003. The book reconstructs the Miami-Illinois language and all its grammatical features. A related project at Miami University is one on [[ethnobotany]], which "pairs Miami-language plant names with elders' descriptions of traditional plant-gathering techniques."&lt;ref name="sfgate2002"/&gt;

'''Nail Men''' or '''Men of Nails''' ({{lang-de|Nagelmänner}}) were a form of propaganda and fundraising for members of the armed forces and their dependents in the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]] and the [[German Empire]] in [[World War I]]. They consisted of wooden statues (usually of knights in armour) into which nails were driven, either iron (black), or coloured silver or gold, in exchange for donations of different amounts. Some took different forms, including pillars, shields or local coats of arms and crosses, especially the [[Iron Cross]], and in German there are a variety of alternate names for them, including ''Wehrmann in Eisen'' or ''eiserner Wehrmann'' (Iron Guardian), ''Nagelfigur'', ''Nagelbild'' or ''Nagelbrett'' (Nail Figure or Nail Board), ''Wehrschild'' (Defence Shield) and ''Kriegswahrzeichen'' (War Monument). The most famous were the original Wehrmann in Eisen in [[Vienna]] and the 'Iron Hindenburg', a 12&amp;nbsp;metre (42&amp;nbsp;foot) statue of [[Paul von Hindenburg|Hindenburg]] adjacent to the [[Berlin Victory Column|Victory Column]] in [[Berlin]].

==Origins and purpose==
[[File:Wehrmann in Eisen 9931.JPG|thumb|Close-up of the Vienna ''Wehrmann im Eisen'' showing the nails]]
The idea for the Nail Men came from the [[Stock im Eisen]] in [[Vienna]], a tree-trunk which had had nails hammered into it for centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Watson, ''Ring of Steel: Germany and Austria-Hungary in World War I'', Basic Books, 2014, {{ISBN|9780465018727}}, p.&amp;nbsp;221.&lt;/ref&gt; The first Nail Man, a medieval knight, was set up in Vienna and was first nailed on 6 March 1915 in a public ceremony attended by many dignitaries, including members of the imperial household and the German and Ottoman ambassadors.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, pp. 221–22.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Munzel3&gt;Dietlinde Munzel-Everling, ''[http://www.munzel-everling.de/download/munzel_nagelfiguren.pdf Kriegsnagelungen: Wehrmann in Eisen, Nagel-Roland, Eisernes Kreuz]'', Wiesbaden, August 2008, p. 3. {{de icon}} (pdf)&lt;/ref&gt; They were promoted as a patriotic fund-raising method in German-speaking parts of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and also in the German Empire, including by publications such as Gotthold Riegelmann's ''Der Stock in Eisen: praktische Ratschläge zur Errichtung einfacher Nagelholzmale mit Ideenskizzen und Kostenberechnungen'' (The Stock im Eisen: practical advice on the erection of simple wooden monuments for nailing with sketched ideas and cost calculations)&lt;ref&gt;Berlin: Wasmuth, n.d., {{OCLC|248487978}}; referenced by Munzel-Everling, p. 5, and dated by her 1915.&lt;/ref&gt; and Benno Fitzke and Paul Matzdorf's ''Eiserne Kreuz-Nagelungen zum Besten der Kriegshilfe und zur Schaffung von Kriegswahrzeichen'' (Iron cross nailings for the best benefit of war aid and for the creation of war monuments).&lt;ref&gt;Leipzig: Strauch, 1916, {{OCLC|72645763}}; referenced with misspellings by Jay Winter, ''Sites of Memory, Sites of Mourning: The Great War in European Cultural History'', Cambridge: Cambridge University, 1995, repr. 1998, {{ISBN|978-0-521-63988-0}}, pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ji9ib28vmTYC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Winter,+Sites+of+memory,+sites+of+mourning&amp;hl=en&amp;src=bmrr&amp;ei=VOGVTpC5MYz9iQKeqYm2DQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=ready-for-use%20materials&amp;f=false 82]&amp;ndash;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Ji9ib28vmTYC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Winter,+Sites+of+memory,+sites+of+mourning&amp;hl=en&amp;src=bmrr&amp;ei=VOGVTpC5MYz9iQKeqYm2DQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAA#v=snippet&amp;q=iron%20cross%20was%20the%20most%20popular%20choice&amp;f=false 83] and [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ji9ib28vmTYC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Winter,+Sites+of+memory,+sites+of+mourning&amp;hl=en&amp;src=bmrr&amp;ei=VOGVTpC5MYz9iQKeqYm2DQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAA#v=snippet&amp;q=Benno%20Stitzte%20and%20Paul%20Matzdorf&amp;f=false p. 245, notes 22, 23]. The book has a subtitle beginning ''Gebrauchsfertiges Material für vaterländische Volksunterhaltung durch Feiern in Schulen'' (Material ready for use for patriotic amusement of the populace through celebration in schools).&lt;/ref&gt; They have been seen as "fit[ting] in much more closely with Protestant celebrations of the Prussian military genius and the grandeur of the ''Kaiserreich''" than with Austrian Catholicism.&lt;ref name=Winter84&gt;Winter, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ji9ib28vmTYC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Winter,+Sites+of+memory,+sites+of+mourning&amp;hl=en&amp;src=bmrr&amp;ei=VOGVTpC5MYz9iQKeqYm2DQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Protestant%20celebrations%20of%20the%20Prussian&amp;f=false p. 84].&lt;/ref&gt;

Municipalities and charitable organisations, either specially founded associations or the [[Red Cross]], had a statue or other emblem made out of wood (oak was sometimes recommended), sometimes by well known sculptors, such as the medieval knight ''Wehrmann in Eisen'' by M. Molitar in [[Leipzig]].&lt;ref name=Munzel4&gt;Munzel-Everling, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Frantzen169&gt;[[Allen J. Frantzen]], ''Bloody Good: Chivalry, Sacrifice, and the Great War'', Chicago: University of Chicago, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-226-26085-3}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=6wTrTje_hI8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Frantzen,+Bloody+Good&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Z-FYTrHWF6vYiALk7smRCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Wehrmann%20in%20Eisen&amp;f=false p. 169].&lt;/ref&gt; The nails which the donor could use depending on the level of the donation could be iron, or silver- or gold-plated. The placement of the nail also reflected the level of the donation.&lt;ref name=Munzel4/&gt; For example, in the case of the [[Iron Cross]] at [[Heidelberg]], a black (iron) nail cost 1 mark, a silver nail hammered into the border, 3 marks, a nail in the '1914' inscription, 5 marks, in the 'W' for Kaiser Wilhelm, 10 marks, and in the crown at the top of the cross, 20 marks;&lt;ref name=Reichert&gt;Folker Reichert, [http://www.uni-heidelberg.de/presse/news/2110reichert.html "Heidelberger Hochschullehrer im Ersten Weltkrieg"], lecture on the occasion of the 65th birthday of Eike Wolgast, [[University of Heidelberg]], 19 October 2001 {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the case of the 'Iron Siegfried' at [[Wiesbaden]], iron nails cost 1 mark, silver-coated, 5&amp;ndash;20 marks, and gilded up to 300 marks, with further donations possible;&lt;ref name=Munzel10&gt;Munzel-Everling, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; in the case of the Hindenburg statue in Berlin, gold nails cost 100 marks, silver and black cost 5 marks, and grey 1 mark; for donations over 500 marks, a small plaque was nailed to the sword.&lt;ref&gt;Sherwin Simmons, "Men of nails: Monuments, expressionism, fetishism, Dadaism", ''RES: Anthropology and Aesthetics'' 40, Autumn 2001, pp. 211&amp;ndash;38, p. 211, note 2 ([https://www.jstor.org/stable/20167547 JSTOR])&lt;/ref&gt; Donations were often recorded in an 'Iron Book', for example at Heidelberg, and the donor often received a lapel pin, a certificate, or some other token of the donation. Medallions, postcards and other associated merchandise were sold as a further source of funds.&lt;ref name=Munzel4/&gt;

An iron cross was a popular choice of form, perhaps the most popular;&lt;ref&gt;Munzel-Everling, p. 5; according to Franzen, [https://books.google.com/books?id=6wTrTje_hI8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Frantzen,+Bloody+Good&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Z-FYTrHWF6vYiALk7smRCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Iron%20Cross%20%28the%20most%20popular%20choice%29&amp;f=false p. 167], and Winter, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ji9ib28vmTYC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Winter,+Sites+of+memory,+sites+of+mourning&amp;hl=en&amp;src=bmrr&amp;ei=VOGVTpC5MYz9iQKeqYm2DQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAA#v=snippet&amp;q=iron%20cross%20was%20the%20most%20popular%20choice&amp;f=false p. 83], the most popular.&lt;/ref&gt; it was specifically recommended by Fitzke and Matzdorf, who state that it would require 160&amp;ndash;200 nails.&lt;ref&gt;Winter [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ji9ib28vmTYC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Winter,+Sites+of+memory,+sites+of+mourning&amp;hl=en&amp;src=bmrr&amp;ei=VOGVTpC5MYz9iQKeqYm2DQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAA#v=snippet&amp;q=between%20160%20and%20200&amp;f=false pp. 83&amp;ndash;84] and p. 245, note 23, referring to Fitzke and Matzdorf p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; Other common shapes were shields and coats of arms, but animals, flowers and ships (including [[U-Boat]]s) were also nailed. The figures in human form typically were knights in armour but sometimes depicted modern soldiers or historical and legendary figures. In addition to Hindenburg, [[Alfred von Tirpitz|Admiral Tirpitz]], [[Rupprecht, Crown Prince of Bavaria]] and General [[Otto von Emmich]] were depicted as Nail Men.&lt;ref&gt;Munzel-Everling, pp. 6&amp;ndash;8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Donations were usually collected to assist the wounded or for widows and orphans of the fallen.&lt;ref name=Munzel4/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Simmons, p. 211 mentions only "[assisting] relatives of soldiers killed in the war."&lt;/ref&gt; But in some cases, for example at [[Schwäbisch Gmünd]], they were intended to help supply front soldiers; in the winter of 1916, the need was particularly great.&lt;ref name=Rauchbein124&gt;Klaus Graf, [http://www.freidok.uni-freiburg.de/volltexte/7515/pdf/Graf_Rauchbein.pdf "Hans Rauchbein: ein Gmünder Bürgermeister im 16.

{{Objectivist movement}}

'''Objectivism''' is a [[philosophical system]] developed by [[Russian Americans|Russian-American]] writer [[Ayn Rand]]. Rand first expressed Objectivism in her fiction, most notably ''[[The Fountainhead]]'' (1943) and ''[[Atlas Shrugged]]'' (1957), and later in non-fiction essays and books.&lt;ref name="Badhwar 2010"&gt;{{harvnb|Badhwar|Long|2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Leonard Peikoff]], a professional philosopher and Rand's designated intellectual heir,&lt;ref&gt;''Contemporary Authors Online'', s.v. "Leonard Peikoff."

Rand described Objectivism as "the concept of man as a heroic being, with his own happiness as the moral purpose of his life, with productive achievement as his noblest activity, and reason as his only absolute".&lt;ref&gt;"About the Author" in {{harvnb|Rand|1992|pp=1170–71}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peikoff characterizes Objectivism as a "closed system" that is not subject to change.&lt;ref name="Fact and Value" /&gt;

Objectivism's central tenets are that [[reality]] exists independently of [[consciousness]], that human beings have direct contact with reality through sense perception (see ''[[Direct and indirect realism]]''), that one can attain objective knowledge from perception through the process of [[concept]] formation and [[inductive logic]], that the proper [[morality|moral]] purpose of one's life is the pursuit of one's own happiness (see ''[[Rational egoism]]''), that the only [[social system]] consistent with this morality is one that displays full respect for [[Individual and group rights|individual rights]] embodied in ''[[laissez-faire]]'' [[capitalism]], and that the role of [[art]] in human life is to transform humans' [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] ideas by selective reproduction of reality into a physical form—a work of art—that one can comprehend and to which one can respond emotionally.

Academic philosophers have mostly ignored or rejected Rand's philosophy.&lt;ref name="academic"&gt;{{harvnb|Sciabarra|2013|p=1}}; {{harvnb|Badhwar|Long|2012}}; {{harvnb|Gotthelf|2000|p=1}}; {{harvnb|Machan|2000|p=9}}; {{harvnb|Gladstein|1999|p=2}}; {{harvnb|Heyl|1995|p=223}}; {{harvnb|Den Uyl|Rasmussen|1984|p=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, Objectivism has been a significant influence among [[Right-libertarianism|right-libertarians]] and [[Conservatism in the United States|American conservatives]].&lt;ref name="politicalinfluence"&gt;{{harvnb|Burns|2009|p=4}}; {{harvnb|Gladstein|2009|pp=107–08, 124}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Objectivist movement]], which Rand founded, attempts to spread her ideas to the public and in academic settings.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sciabarra|1995|pp=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Philosophy ==
Rand originally expressed her philosophical ideas in her novels, most notably, ''The Fountainhead'' and ''Atlas Shrugged''. She further elaborated on them in her periodicals ''[[The Objectivist Newsletter]]'', ''[[The Objectivist]]'', and ''[[Objectivist periodicals#The Ayn Rand Letter|The Ayn Rand Letter]]'', and in non-fiction books such as ''[[Introduction to Objectivist Epistemology]]'' and ''[[The Virtue of Selfishness]]''.&lt;ref name="Rubin"&gt;{{cite news |first=Harriet |last=Rubin |title=Ayn Rand's Literature of Capitalism |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/15/business/15atlas.html |publisher=The New York Times |date=September 15, 2007 |accessdate=September 18, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name "Objectivism" derives from the idea that human knowledge and values are [[objectivity (philosophy)|objective]]: they exist and are determined by the nature of reality, to be discovered by one's mind, and are not created by the thoughts one has.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1967|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rand stated that she chose the name because her preferred term for a philosophy based on the primacy of [[existence]]—"[[existentialism]]"—had already been taken.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Peikoff|1991|p=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rand characterized Objectivism as "a philosophy for living on earth", grounded in reality, and aimed at defining human nature and the nature of the world in which we live.&lt;ref name="Rubin"/&gt;

===Metaphysics: objective reality===
Rand's philosophy begins with three [[axiom]]s: existence, consciousness, and [[Law of identity|identity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Peikoff|1991|pp=4–11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rand defined an axiom as "a statement that identifies the base of knowledge and of any further statement pertaining to that knowledge, a statement necessarily contained in all others whether any particular speaker chooses to identify it or not. An axiom is a proposition that defeats its opponents by the fact that they have to accept it and use it in the process of any attempt to deny it."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1992|p=1040}}.&lt;/ref&gt; As Objectivist philosopher [[Leonard Peikoff]] argued, Rand's argument for axioms "is not a proof that the axioms of existence, consciousness, and identity are true. It is proof that they are ''axioms'', that they are at the base of knowledge and thus inescapable."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Peikoff|1991|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rand held that ''existence'' is the perceptually self-evident fact at the base of all other knowledge, i.e., that "existence exists." She further held that to be is to be ''something'', that "existence ''is'' identity." That is, to be is to be "an entity of a specific nature made of specific attributes." That which has no nature or attributes does not and cannot exist. The axiom of existence is grasped in differentiating something from nothing, while the law of identity is grasped in differentiating one thing from another, i.e., one's first awareness of the law of non-contradiction, another crucial base for the rest of knowledge. As Rand wrote, "A leaf ... cannot be all red and green at the same time, it cannot freeze and burn at the same time... [[A is A]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1992|p=1016}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Objectivism rejects belief in anything alleged to transcend existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Peikoff|1991|pp=31–33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rand argued that consciousness is "the faculty of perceiving that which exists." As she put it, "to be conscious is to be conscious of ''something''", that is consciousness itself cannot be distinguished or grasped except in relation to an independent reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Peikoff|1991|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; "It cannot be aware only of itself—there is no 'itself' until it is aware of something."&lt;ref name="Gotthelf"&gt;{{harvnb|Gotthelf|2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, Objectivism holds that the mind does not create reality, but rather, it is a means of discovering reality.&lt;ref name="ITOE"&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; Expressed differently, existence has "primacy" over consciousness, which must conform to it. Any other approach Rand termed "the primacy of consciousness", including any variant of metaphysical subjectivism or theism.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1982|pp=24–28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Objectivist philosophy derives its explanations of action and [[Causality|causation]] from the axiom of identity, calling causation "the law of identity applied to action."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1992|p=1037}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Rand, it is entities that act, and every action is the action of an [[entity]]. The way entities act is caused by the specific nature (or "identity") of those entities; if they were different they would act differently. As with the other axioms, an implicit understanding of causation is derived from one's primary observations of causal connections among entities even before it is verbally identified, and serves as the basis of further knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Peikoff|1991|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Epistemology: reason===
According to Rand, attaining knowledge beyond what is given in perception requires both [[volition (psychology)|volition]] (or the exercise of [[free will]]) and adherence to a specific method of validation through observation, concept-formation, and the application of [[inductive reasoning|inductive]] and [[deductive reasoning]]. For example, a belief in dragons, however sincere, does not mean reality contains any dragons. A process of proof identifying the basis in reality of a claimed item of knowledge is necessary to establish its truth.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Peikoff|1991|pp=116–21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Objectivist [[epistemology]] begins with the principle that "consciousness is identification". This is understood to be a direct consequence of the metaphysical principle that "existence is identity."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1961|p=124}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rand defined "reason" as "the faculty that identifies and integrates the material provided by man's senses."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1964|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Says Rand, "The fundamental concept of method, the one on which all the others depend, is [[logic]]. The distinguishing characteristic of logic (the art of non-contradictory identification) indicates the nature of the actions (actions of consciousness required to achieve a correct identification) and their goal (knowledge)—while omitting the length, complexity or specific steps of the process of logical inference, as well as the nature of the particular cognitive problem involved in any given instance of using logic."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1990|p=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Rand, [[consciousness]] possesses a specific and finite identity, just like everything else that exists; therefore, it must operate by a specific method of validation. An item of knowledge cannot be "disqualified" by being arrived at by a specific process in a particular form. Thus, for Rand, the fact that consciousness must itself possess identity implies the rejection of both universal skepticism based on the "limits" of consciousness, as well as any claim to revelation, emotion or faith based belief.

Objectivist epistemology maintains that all knowledge is ultimately based on perception. "Percepts, not sensations, are the given, the self-evident."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1990|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rand considered the validity of the senses to be axiomatic, and claimed that purported arguments to the contrary all commit the fallacy of the "stolen concept"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Branden |first=Nathaniel |date=January 1963 |title=The Stolen Concept |journal=The Objectivist Newsletter |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=2, 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; by presupposing the validity of concepts that, in turn, presuppose the validity of the senses.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1990|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; She held that perception, being physiologically determined, is incapable of error. For example, [[optical illusion]]s are errors in the conceptual identification of what is seen, not errors in sight itself.&lt;ref name="Kelley 1986"&gt;{{harvnb|Kelley|1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; The validity of sense perception, therefore, is not susceptible to proof (because it is presupposed by all proof as proof is only a matter of adducing sensory evidence) nor should its validity be denied (since the conceptual tools one would have to use to do this are derived from sensory data). Perceptual error, therefore, is not possible. Rand consequently rejected [[philosophical skepticism|epistemological skepticism]], as she holds that the skeptics' claim to knowledge "distorted" by the form or the means of perception is impossible.&lt;ref name="Kelley 1986"/&gt;

The Objectivist theory of perception distinguishes between the ''form'' and ''object.'' The form in which an organism perceives is determined by the physiology of its sensory systems. Whatever form the organism perceives it in, what it perceives—the object of perception—is reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kelley|1986}}; {{harvnb|Peikoff|1991|pp=44–48}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rand consequently rejected the [[Kantianism|Kantian]] dichotomy between "things as we perceive them" and "things as they are in themselves." Says Rand, "The attack on man's consciousness and particularly on his conceptual faculty has rested on the unchallenged premise that any knowledge acquired by a ''process'' of consciousness is necessarily subjective and cannot correspond to the facts of reality, since it is ''"processed'' knowledge...[but] all knowledge ''is'' processed knowledge—whether on the sensory, perceptual or conceptual level. An "unprocessed" knowledge would be a knowledge acquired without means of cognition."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1990|p=81}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The aspect of epistemology given the most elaboration by Rand is the theory of concept-formation, which she presented in ''[[Introduction to Objectivist Epistemology]]''. She argued that concepts are formed by a process of measurement omission. Peikoff described her view as follows:

{{quote|To form a concept, one mentally ''isolates'' a group of concretes (of distinct perceptual units), on the basis of observed similarities which distinguish them from all other known concretes (similarity is 'the relationship between two or more existents which possess the same characteristic(s), but in different measure or degree'); then, by a process of omitting the particular measurements of these concretes, one ''integrates'' them into a single new mental unit: the concept, which subsumes all concretes of this kind (a potentially unlimited number). The integration is completed and retained by the selection of a perceptual symbol (a word) to designate it. "A concept is a mental integration of two or more units possessing the same distinguishing characteristic(s), with their particular measurements omitted."&lt;ref&gt;Peikoff, Leonard. "The Analytic-Synthetic Dichotomy." in {{harvnb|Rand|1990|pp=97–98}}. The quotes within this passage are of Rand's material elsewhere in the same book.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to Rand, "[T]he term 'measurements omitted' does not mean, in this context, that measurements are regarded as non-existent; it means that ''measurements exist, but are not specified''. That measurements ''must'' exist is an essential part of the process. The principle is: the relevant measurements must exist in ''some'' quantity, but may exist in ''any'' quantity."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1990|p=12}}; for more on Rand's theory of concepts see also Kelley, David "A Theory of Abstraction" and "The Psychology of Abstraction", ''Cognition and Brain Theory'' vol. vii, no. 3 and 4 (Summer/Fall 1984), and Rasmussen, Douglas B., "Quine and Aristotelian Essentialism," ''The New Scholasticism'' 58 (Summer, 1984)&lt;/ref&gt;

Rand argued that concepts are hierarchically organized. Concepts such as 'dog,' which bring together "concretes" available in perception, can be differentiated (into the concepts of 'dachshund,' 'poodle,' etc.) or integrated (along with 'cat,' etc., into the concept of 'animal'). Abstract concepts such as 'animal' can be further integrated, via "abstraction from abstractions", into such concepts as 'living thing.' Concepts are formed in the context of knowledge available. A young child differentiates dogs from cats and chickens, but need not explicitly differentiate them from deep-sea tube worms, or from other types of animals not yet known to him, to form a concept 'dog.'&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1990|pp=15–28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of its view of concepts as "open-ended" classifications that go well beyond the characteristics included in their past or current definitions, Objectivist epistemology rejects the [[Analytic–synthetic distinction|analytic-synthetic distinction]] as a false dichotomy&lt;ref&gt;Peikoff, Leonard. "The Analytic-Synthetic Dichotomy," in {{harvnb|Rand|1990|p=94}}&lt;/ref&gt; and denies the possibility of ''[[a priori (philosophy)|a priori]]'' knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Peikoff, Leonard. "The Analytic-Synthetic Dichotomy". in {{harvnb|Rand|1990|pp=116–18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rand rejected "feeling" as sources of knowledge. Rand acknowledged the importance of emotion for human beings, but she maintained that emotions are a consequence of the conscious or subconscious ideas that a person already accepts, not a means of achieving awareness of reality. "Emotions are not tools of cognition."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1961|p=64}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rand also rejected all forms of [[faith]] or mysticism, terms that she used synonymously. She defined faith as "the acceptance of allegations without evidence or proof, either apart from or ''against'' the evidence of one's senses and reason... Mysticism is the claim to some non-sensory, non-rational, non-definable, non-identifiable means of knowledge, such as 'instinct,' 'intuition,' 'revelation,' or any form of 'just knowing.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1982|pp=62–63}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reliance on revelation is like reliance on a [[Ouija|Ouija board]]; it bypasses the need to show how it connects its results to reality. Faith, for Rand, is not a "short-cut" to knowledge, but a "short-circuit" destroying it.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1961|p=223}}; {{harvnb|Peikoff|1991|pp=182–85}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Objectivism acknowledges the facts that human beings have limited knowledge, are vulnerable to error, and do not instantly understand all of the implications of their knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Lecture by Leonard Peikoff, cited in {{harvnb|Sciabarra|1995}}.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Peikoff, one can be certain of a proposition if all of the available evidence supports it, i.e., it can be logically integrated with the rest of one's knowledge; one is then certain within the context of the evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Peikoff|1991|pp=171–81}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rand rejected the traditional [[rationalism|rationalist]]/[[empiricism|empiricist]] dichotomy, arguing that it embodies a false alternative: conceptually-based knowledge independent of perception (rationalism) versus perceptually-based knowledge independent of concepts (empiricism). Rand argued that neither is possible because the senses provide the material of knowledge while conceptual processing is also needed to establish knowable propositions.

====Criticisms on epistemology====
The philosopher [[John Hospers]], who was influenced by Rand and shared her moral and political views, disagreed with her over issues of epistemology.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Branden|1987|p=323}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some philosophers, such as [[Tibor Machan]], have argued that the Objectivist epistemology is incomplete.&lt;ref name="tiborneedwork"&gt;For example, {{harvnb|Machan|2000|pp=134–51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychology professor Robert L. Campbell says the relationship between Objectivist epistemology and cognitive science remains unclear because Rand made claims about human cognition and its development which belong to psychology, yet Rand also argued that philosophy is logically prior to psychology and in no way dependent on it.&lt;ref name="itoephilpsych"&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1990|p=289}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cogrev"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Campbell |first=R.

The philosophers Randall Dipert and [[Roderick Long]] have argued that Objectivist epistemology conflates the perceptual process by which judgments are formed with the way in which they are to be justified, thereby leaving it unclear how sensory data can validate propositionally structured judgments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dipert |first=Randall R. |date=Spring 1987 |title=Review Essay: David Kelley's ''Evidence of the Senses: A Realist Theory of Perception'' |journal=Reason Papers |issue=12 |pages=57–70 |url=http://www.reasonpapers.com/pdf/12/rp_12_7.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Reason and Value: Rand versus Aristotle |last=Long |first=Roderick T. |authorlink=Roderick Long |location=Poughkeepsie, New York |publisher=The Objectivist Center |year=2000 |isbn=978-1-57724-045-7 |oclc=49875339 |series=Objectivist Studies Monographs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Objectivism includes an extensive treatment of ethical concerns. Rand wrote on morality in her works ''The Virtue of Selfishness,'' ''We the Living,'' and ''[[Atlas Shrugged]]''. Rand defines morality as "a code of values to guide man's choices and actions—the choices and actions that determine the purpose and the course of his life."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1964|p=13}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Rand maintained that the first question is not what should the code of values be, the first question is "Does man need values at all—and why?" According to Rand, "it is only the concept of 'Life' that makes the concept of 'Value' possible," and, "the fact that a living entity ''is'', determines what it ''ought'' to do."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1964|p=18}}; for more on Rand's metaethics see {{harvnb|Binswanger|1990|pp=58–66}}, {{harvnb|Smith|2000}} and {{harvnb|Gotthelf|Lennox|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rand writes: "there is only one fundamental alternative in the universe: existence or non-existence—and it pertains to a single class of entities: to living organisms. The existence of inanimate matter is unconditional, the existence of life is not: it depends on a specific course of action... It is only a living organism that faces a constant alternative: the issue of life or death..."

Rand argued that the primary focus of man's [[free will]] is in the choice: 'to think or not to think'. "Thinking is not an automatic function. In any hour and issue of his life, man is free to think or to evade that effort. Thinking requires a state of full, focused awareness. The act of focusing one's consciousness is volitional. Man can focus his mind to a full, active, purposefully directed awareness of reality—or he can unfocus it and let himself drift in a semiconscious daze, merely reacting to any chance stimulus of the immediate moment, at the mercy of his undirected sensory-perceptual mechanism and of any random, associational connections it might happen to make."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1964|p=22}}; for more on Rand's theory of volition, see {{harvnb|Binswanger|1991}}; {{harvnb|Branden|1969}}; and {{harvnb|Peikoff|1991|pp=55–72}}.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Rand, therefore, possessing free will, human beings must ''choose'' their values: one does not ''automatically'' hold one's own life as his ultimate value. Whether in fact a person's actions promote and fulfill his own life or not is a question of fact, as it is with all other organisms, but whether a person will act to promote his well-being is up to him, not hard-wired into his physiology. "Man has the power to act as his own destroyer—and that is the way he has acted through most of his history."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1992|p=1013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Says Rand, "Man's mind is his basic tool of survival. Life is given to him, survival is not. His body is given to him, its sustenance is not. His mind is given to him, its content is not. To remain alive he must act and before he can act he must know the nature and purpose of his action. He cannot obtain his food without knowledge of food and of the way to obtain it. He cannot dig a ditch—or build a cyclotron—without a knowledge of his aim and the means to achieve it. To remain alive, he must think."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1992|p=1012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her novels, ''The Fountainhead'' and ''Atlas Shrugged'', she also emphasizes the central importance of productive work, romantic love and art to human happiness, and dramatizes the ethical character of their pursuit. The primary virtue in Objectivist ethics is [[rationality]], as Rand meant it "the recognition and acceptance of reason as one's only source of knowledge, one's only judge of values and one's only guide to action."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1964|p=25}}; {{harvnb|Smith|2006|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The purpose of a moral code, Rand held, is to provide the principles by reference to which man can achieve the values his survival requires.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Peikoff|1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rand summarizes:

{{quote|If [man] chooses to live, a rational ethics will tell him what principles of action are required to implement his choice. If he does not choose to live, nature will take its course. Reality confronts a man with a great many "must's", but all of them are conditional: the formula of realistic necessity is: "you must, if&amp;nbsp;–" and the if stands for man's choice: "if you want to achieve a certain goal".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1982|pp=118–19}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Rand's explanation of values presents the view that an individual's primary moral obligation is to achieve his own well-being—it is for his life and his self-interest that an individual ought to adhere to a moral code.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|2006|pp=23–24}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ethical egoism]] is a corollary of setting man's life as the moral standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Peikoff|1991|p=230}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rand believed that rational egoism is the [[logical consequence]] of humans following evidence wherever it leads them. The only alternative would be that they live without orientation to reality.

A corollary to Rand's endorsement of self-interest is her rejection of the [[Altruism (ethics)|ethical doctrine of altruism]]—which she defined in the sense of [[Auguste Comte]]'s altruism (he coined the term), as a moral obligation to live for the sake of others. Rand also rejected subjectivism. A "whim-worshiper" or "hedonist," according to Rand, is not motivated by a desire to live his own human life, but by a wish to live on a sub-human level. Instead of using "that which promotes my (human) life" as his standard of value, he mistakes "that which I (mindlessly happen to) value" for a standard of value, in contradiction of the fact that, existentially, he is a human and therefore rational organism. The "I value" in whim-worship or hedonism can be replaced with "we value," "he values," "they value," or "God values," and still it would remain dissociated from reality. Rand repudiated the equation of rational selfishness with hedonistic or whim-worshiping "selfishness-without-a-self."  She held that the former is good, and the latter evil, and that there is a fundamental difference between them.&lt;ref name="vos"&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1964|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For Rand, all of the principal [[virtue]]s are applications of the role of reason as man's basic tool of survival: rationality, honesty, justice, independence, integrity, productiveness, and pride—each of which she explains in some detail in "The Objectivist Ethics."&lt;ref&gt;See also {{harvnb|Smith|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The essence of Objectivist ethics is summarized by the oath her ''Atlas Shrugged'' character John Galt adhered to: "I swear—by my life and my love of it—that I will never live for the sake of another man, nor ask another man to live for mine."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1992|p=731}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Criticisms on ethics====
Many philosophers have criticized Objectivist ethics. The philosopher [[Robert Nozick]] argues that Rand's foundational argument in ethics is unsound because it does not explain why someone could not rationally prefer dying and having no values. He argues that her attempt to defend the morality of selfishness is, therefore, an instance of [[begging the question]]. Nozick also argues that Rand's solution to [[David Hume]]'s famous [[is-ought problem]] is unsatisfactory. In response, the philosophers [[Douglas B. Rasmussen]] and [[Douglas Den Uyl]] have argued that Nozick misstated Rand's case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Ayn Rand and the Is-Ought Problem |last=O'Neil |first=Patrick M. |journal=Journal of Libertarian Studies |date=Spring 1983 |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=81–99 |url=https://www.mises.org/sites/default/files/7_1_4_0.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Nozick On the Randian Argument |last1=Den Uyl |first1=Douglas |last2=Rasmussen |first2=Douglas |journal=The Personalist |date=April 1978 |volume=59 |pages=184–205}} Reprinted along with Nozick's article in ''Reading Nozick'', J. Paul, ed., 1981, [[Rowman &amp; Littlefield]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Charles King criticized Rand's example of an indestructible robot to demonstrate the value of life as incorrect and confusing.&lt;ref&gt;King, J. Charles. "Life and the Theory of Value: The Randian Argument Reconsidered" in {{harvnb|Den Uyl|Rasmussen|1984}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In response, Paul St. F. Blair defended Rand's ethical conclusions, while maintaining that his arguments might not have been approved by Rand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.reasonpapers.com/pdf/10/rp_10_7.pdf |title=The Randian Argument Reconsidered: A Reply to Charles King |first=Paul |last=St. F.

Rand's defense of individual liberty integrates elements from her entire philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Peikoff|1991|p=354}}; {{harvnb|Sciabarra|1995|p=274}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since reason is the means of human knowledge, it is therefore each person's most fundamental means of survival and is necessary to the achievement of values.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bernstein|2009|pp=25–31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use or threat of [[Force (law)|force]] neutralizes the practical effect of an individual's reason, whether the force originates from the state or from a criminal. According to Rand, "man's mind will not function at the point of a gun."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1967|p=141}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the only type of organized human behavior consistent with the operation of reason is that of voluntary cooperation. Persuasion is the method of reason. By its nature, the overtly irrational cannot rely on the use of persuasion and must ultimately resort to force to prevail.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Peikoff|1991|pp=310–13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, Rand saw reason and freedom as correlates, just as she saw mysticism and force as corollaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1982|p=66}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on this understanding of the role of reason, Objectivists hold that the initiation of physical force against the will of another is immoral,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1964|p=36}}; {{harvnb|Peikoff|1991|p=310}}; {{harvnb|Smith|1997|pp=143–47}}&lt;/ref&gt; as are indirect initiations of force through threats,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|1997|pp=150–55}}&lt;/ref&gt; fraud,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Peikoff|1991|pp=319}}&lt;/ref&gt; or breach of contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1964|pp=129–30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of defensive or retaliatory force, on the other hand, is appropriate.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1964|p=126}}; {{harvnb|Peikoff|1991|p=320}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Objectivism holds that because the opportunity to use reason without the initiation of force is necessary to achieve moral values, each individual has an inalienable moral [[natural and legal rights|right]] to act as his own judgment directs and to keep the product of his effort. Peikoff, explaining the basis of rights, stated, "In content, as the founding fathers recognized, there is one fundamental right, which has several major derivatives. The fundamental right is the right to life. Its major derivatives are the right to liberty, property, and the pursuit of happiness."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Peikoff|1991|pp=351–52}}. The Objectivist understanding of rights is explored at length in {{harvnb|Smith|1997}}.&lt;/ref&gt; "A 'right' is a moral principle defining and sanctioning a man's freedom of action in a social context."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1964|p=110}}&lt;/ref&gt; These rights are specifically understood to be rights to action, not to specific results or objects, and the obligations created by rights are negative in nature: each individual must refrain from violating the rights of others.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Peikoff|1991|p=355}}&lt;/ref&gt; Objectivists reject alternative notions of rights, such as [[positive rights]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|1997|pp=165–82}}; {{harvnb|Touchstone|2006|p=108}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[collective rights]], or [[animal rights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Peikoff|1991|pp=356–58}}; {{harvnb|Rand|1964|pp=120}}&lt;/ref&gt; Objectivism holds that the only social system which fully recognizes individual rights is capitalism,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1967|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; specifically what Rand described as "full, pure, uncontrolled, unregulated laissez-faire capitalism."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1964|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; Objectivism regards capitalism as the social system which is most beneficial to the poor, but does not consider this its primary justification.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Peikoff|1991|pp=392–395}}; {{harvnb|Sciabarra|1995|p=284}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather, it is the only moral social system. Objectivism maintains that only societies seeking to establish freedom (or free nations) have a right to [[self-determination]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1964|p=103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Objectivism views government as "the means of placing the retaliatory use of physical force under objective control—i.e., under objectively defined laws;" thus, government is both legitimate and critically important&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Peikoff|1991|p=364}}&lt;/ref&gt; in order to protect individual rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1964|pp=125–28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rand opposed [[anarchism]] because she saw putting police and courts on the market as an inherent miscarriage of [[justice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1964|p=112}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Objectivism holds that the proper functions of a government are "''the police'', to protect men from criminals—''[[military|the armed services]]'', to protect men from foreign invaders—''[[courts|the law courts]]'', to settle disputes among men according to objectively defined laws," the [[Executive (government)|executive]], and [[legislatures]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1964|p=131}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, in protecting individual rights, the government is acting as an agent of its citizens and "has no rights except the rights ''delegated'' to it by the citizens"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1964|p=129}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it must act in an impartial manner according to specific, objectively defined laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1964|p=128}}; {{harvnb|Peikoff|1991|pp=364–65}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prominent Objectivists Peikoff and [[Yaron Brook]] have since expressed support for other government functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peikoff.com/2011/03/07/what-role-should-certain-specific-governments-play-in-objectivist-government/|title=What role should certain specific governments play in Objectivist government?

Rand argued that limited [[intellectual property rights|intellectual property]] monopolies being granted to certain inventors and artists on a first-to-file basis are moral because she viewed all property as fundamentally intellectual. Furthermore, the value of a commercial product comes in part from the necessary work of its inventors. However, Rand viewed limits on patents and copyrights as important and held that if they were granted in perpetuity, it would necessarily lead to ''de facto'' collectivism.

Rand opposed [[racism]] and any legal application of racism. She considered [[affirmative action]] to be an example of legal racism.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1964|pp=173–84}}; ''cf''. {{cite book |title=The Other Side of Racism |last=Wortham |first=Anne |location=Columbus, Ohio |publisher=Ohio State University Press |year=1981 |isbn=978-0-8142-0318-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rand advocated the right to legal [[abortion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rand |first=Ayn |chapter=Of Living Death |others=Edited by Leonard Peikoff |title=The Voice of Reason |location=New York |publisher=New American Library |year=1989 |isbn=978-0-453-00634-7|title-link=The Voice of Reason (book) }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rand believed [[capital punishment]] is morally justified as retribution against a murderer, but dangerous due to the risk of mistakenly executing innocent people and opening the door to state murder. She therefore said she opposed capital punishment "on epistemological, not moral, grounds."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|2005|pp=45–46}}&lt;/ref&gt; She opposed involuntary [[military conscription]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1967|pp=226–28}}&lt;/ref&gt; She opposed any form of [[censorship]], including legal restrictions on [[pornography]], [[freedom of opinion|opinion]] or [[freedom to worship|worship]], famously quipping; "In the transition to statism, every infringement of human rights has begun with a given right's least attractive practitioners".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1982|pp=173–84}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/free_speech.html|title=Free Speech|website=Ayn Rand Lexicon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Objectivists have also opposed a number of government activities commonly supported by both liberals and conservatives, including [[antitrust]] laws,&lt;ref&gt;Greenspan, Alan. "Antitrust" in {{harvnb|Rand|1967|pp=63–71}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[minimum wage]], [[public education]],&lt;ref&gt;Branden, Nathaniel. "Common Fallacies about Capitalism" in {{harvnb|Rand|1967|pp=89–92}}&lt;/ref&gt; and existing [[child labor]] laws.&lt;ref&gt;Hessen, Robert. "The Effects of the Industrial Revolution on Women and Children" in {{harvnb|Rand|1967|pp=110–13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Objectivists have argued against [[faith-based initiatives]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aynrand.org/site/News2?&amp;id=7475 |title=Faith-Based Initiatives Are an Assault on Secular Government |last=Epstein |first=Alex |date=February 4, 2003 |publisher=Ayn Rand Institute |accessdate=June 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; displaying religious symbols in government facilities,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aynrand.org/site/News2?&amp;id=10889 |title=The Ten Commandments vs. America |first=Harry |last=Binswanger |date=March 3, 2005 |publisher=Ayn Rand Institute |accessdate=June 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the teaching of "[[intelligent design]]" in public schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.aynrand.org/site/News2?&amp;id=11555 |title='Intelligent Design' Is about Religion versus Reason |newspaper=Orange County Register |first=Keith |last=Lockitch |date=December 11, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maintaining that it should be phased out gradually, Rand opposed [[taxation]] as she considered it theft and an endorsement of force over reason.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Peikoff|1991|p=368}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ayn Rand Answers: The Best of Her Q &amp; A&lt;/ref&gt;

====Criticisms on politics====
Some critics, including economists and political philosophers such as, [[Murray Rothbard]], [[David D. Friedman]], [[Roy Childs]], [[Norman P. Barry]], and [[Chandran Kukathas]], have argued that Objectivist ethics are consistent with [[anarcho-capitalism]] instead of [[minarchism]].&lt;ref&gt;Childs, Roy (1969). "[http://www.isil.org/ayn-rand/childs-open-letter.html Objectivism and The State: An Open Letter to Ayn Rand]"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Barry|1987|pp=128–29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kukathas"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Burns|2009|pp=250–51}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://mises.org/easaran/chap3.asp |last=Rothbard |first=Murray N. |title=Anatomy of the State: What the State Is Not |website=Egalitarianism as a Revolt Against Nature and Other Essays |year=1974}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aesthetics: metaphysical value-judgments===
{{See also|Romantic realism}}
The Objectivist theory of [[art]] flows from its epistemology, by way of "psycho-epistemology" (Rand's term for an individual's characteristic mode of functioning in acquiring knowledge). Art, according to Objectivism, serves a human cognitive need: it allows human beings to grasp concepts as though they were [[percept]]s. Objectivism defines "art" as a "selective re-creation of reality according to an artist's metaphysical value-judgments"—that is, according to what the artist believes to be ultimately true and important about the nature of reality and humanity. In this respect Objectivism regards art as a way of presenting abstractions concretely, in perceptual form.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Peikoff|1991|p=417}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The human need for art, on this view, stems from the need for cognitive economy. A concept is already a sort of mental shorthand standing for a large number of concretes, allowing a human being to think indirectly or implicitly of many more such concretes than can be held explicitly in mind. But a human being cannot hold indefinitely many concepts explicitly in mind either—and yet, on the Objectivist view, needs a comprehensive conceptual framework to provide guidance in life. Art offers a way out of this dilemma by providing a perceptual, easily grasped means of communicating and thinking about a wide range of abstractions, including one's metaphysical value-judgments. Objectivism regards art as an effective way to communicate a moral or ethical ideal.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Peikoff|1991|p=422}}&lt;/ref&gt; Objectivism does not, however, regard art as propagandistic: even though art involves moral values and ideals, its purpose is not to educate, only to show or project. Moreover, art need not be, and usually is not, the outcome of a full-blown, explicit philosophy. Usually it stems from an artist's ''sense of life'' (which is preconceptual and largely emotional).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Peikoff|1991|p=426}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The end goal of Rand's own artistic endeavors was to portray the ideal man. ''The Fountainhead'' is the best example of this effort.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Barr|2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rand uses the character of Roark to embody the concept of the higher man which she believes is what great art should do - embody the characteristics of the best of humanity. This higher symbolism should be represented in all art; artistic expression should be an extension of the greatness in humanity.

Rand held that Romanticism was the highest school of literary art, noting that Romanticism was "based on the recognition of the principle that man possesses the faculty of volition," absent which, Rand believed, literature is robbed of dramatic power, adding:

{{quote|What the Romanticists brought to art was the ''primacy of values''... Values are the source of emotions: a great deal of emotional intensity was projected in the work of the Romanticists and in the reactions of their audiences, as well as a great deal of color, imagination, originality, excitement, and all the other consequences of a value-oriented view of life.&lt;ref&gt;"What is Romanticism?" in {{harvnb|Rand|1971}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The term "romanticism," however, is often affiliated with emotionalism, to which Objectivism is completely opposed. Historically, many romantic artists were philosophically [[subjectivist]]. Most Objectivists who are also artists subscribe to what they call [[romantic realism]], which is how Rand labeled her own work.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Torres|Kamhi|2000|pp=31–32}}; {{harvnb|Holzer|2005|pp=115–25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several authors have developed and applied Rand's ideas in their own work. Rand described Peikoff's ''[[The Ominous Parallels]]'' (1982), as "the first book by an Objectivist philosopher other than myself."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1982|p=vii}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991, Peikoff published ''[[Objectivism: The Philosophy of Ayn Rand]]'', a comprehensive exposition of Rand's philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Peikoff|1991|p=iv}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chris Matthew Sciabarra]] discusses Rand's ideas and theorizes about their intellectual origins in ''[[Ayn Rand: The Russian Radical]]'' (1995). Surveys such as ''[[On Ayn Rand]]'' by [[Allan Gotthelf]] (1999), ''Ayn Rand'' by [[Tibor R. Machan]] (2000), and ''Objectivism in One Lesson'' by [[Andrew Bernstein]] (2009) provide briefer introductions to Rand's ideas.

Some scholars have focused on applying Objectivism in more specific areas. Machan has developed Rand's contextual conception of human knowledge (while also drawing on the insights of [[J. L. Austin]] and [[Gilbert Harman]]) in works such as ''Objectivity'' (2004), and [[David Kelley]] has explicated Rand's epistemological ideas in works such as ''The Evidence of the Senses'' (1986) and ''A Theory of Abstraction'' (2001). In the field of ethics, Kelley has argued in works such as ''Unrugged Individualism'' (1996) and ''The Contested Legacy of Ayn Rand'' (2000) that Objectivists should pay more attention to the virtue of benevolence and place less emphasis on issues of moral sanction. Kelley's views have been controversial, and critics Peikoff and [[Peter Schwartz (writer)|Peter Schwartz]] have argued that he contradicts important principles of Objectivism.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Peikoff|1989}}; {{harvnb|Schwartz|1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kelley has used the term "Open Objectivism" for a version of Objectivism that involves "a commitment to reasoned, non-dogmatic discussion and debate," "the recognition that Objectivism is open to expansion, refinement, and revision," and "a policy of benevolence toward others, including fellow-travelers and critics."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.atlassociety.org/open_objectivism_david_kelley|website=Atlas Society|title=A Note to Our Members About Open Objectivism|date=October 17, 2008|last=Kelley|first=David}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arguing against Kelley, Peikoff characterized Objectivism as a "closed system" that is not subject to change.&lt;ref name="Fact and Value"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Fact and Value |journal=The Intellectual Activist |date=May 18, 1989 |volume=5 |issue=1 |first=Leonard |last=Peikoff |url=http://ari.aynrand.org/issues/culture-and-society/religion-and-morality/Fact-and-Value}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An author who focuses on Rand's ethics, [[Tara Smith (philosopher)|Tara Smith]], stays closer to Rand's original ideas in such works as ''Moral Rights and Political Freedom'' (1995), ''Viable Values'' (2000), and ''Ayn Rand's Normative Ethics'' (2006).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Comments on Tara Smith's ''Viable Values'' |accessdate=May 29, 2009 |date=December 2000 |url=http://enlightenment.supersaturated.com/essays/text/irfankhawaja/viablevaluescomment.html |first=Irfan |last=Khawaja}}; {{cite journal |title=Egoism Explained: A Review of Tara Smith's ''Ayn Rand's Normative Ethics: The Virtuous Egoist'' |journal=The Objective Standard |date=Spring 2007 |volume=2 |issue=1 |url=http://www.theobjectivestandard.com/issues/2007-spring/egoism-explained.asp |first=Diana |last=Hsieh |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; In collaboration with Peikoff, David Harriman has developed a theory of [[scientific method|scientific]] [[Inductive reasoning|induction]] based upon Rand's theory of concepts in ''The Logical Leap: Induction in Physics'' (2010).&lt;ref&gt;Harriman, David, ''The Logical Leap'', 2010, New American Library.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[political philosophy|political]] aspects of Rand's philosophy are discussed by Bernstein in ''The Capitalist Manifesto'' (2005). In ''Capitalism: A Treatise on Economics'' (1996), [[George Reisman]] attempts to integrate Objectivist methodology and insights with both [[Classical Economics|Classical]] and [[Austrian Economics|Austrian economics]]. In psychology, Professor [[Edwin A. Locke]] and Ellen Kenner have explored Rand's ideas in ''The Selfish Path to Romance: How to Love with Passion &amp; Reason''.&lt;ref&gt;Locke, Edwin, and Kenner, Ellen, Platform, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Other writers have explored the application of Objectivism to fields ranging from [[aesthetics|art]], as in ''What Art Is'' by Louis Torres and [[Michelle Marder Kamhi]] (2000), to [[teleology]], as in ''The Biological Basis of Teleological Concepts'' by [[Harry Binswanger]] (1990).

Academic philosophers have generally dismissed Objectivism since Rand first presented it.&lt;ref name="academic"/&gt; Objectivism has been called "fiercely anti-academic" because of Rand's criticism of contemporary intellectuals.&lt;ref name="McLemee"/&gt; [[David Sidorsky]], a professor of moral and political philosophy at Columbia University, says Rand's work is "outside the mainstream" and is more of an ideological movement than a well-grounded philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Harvey |first=Benjamin |url=http://www.rutlandherald.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20050515/NEWS/505150346/1014 |title=Ayn Rand at 100: An 'ism' struts its stuff |publisher=''[[Rutland Herald]]'' |date=May 15, 2005 |accessdate=July 20, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071226153815/http://www.rutlandherald.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20050515%2FNEWS%2F505150346%2F1014# |archive-date=December 26, 2007 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; British philosopher [[Ted Honderich]] notes that he deliberately excluded an article on Rand from ''[[The Oxford Companion to Philosophy]]'' (Rand is, however, mentioned in the article on popular philosophy by [[Anthony Quinton, Baron Quinton|Anthony Quinton]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Honderich|2005|pp=x, 740}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rand is the subject of entries in the ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'',&lt;ref name="Badhwar 2010"/&gt; ''The Dictionary of Modern American Philosophers'',&lt;ref name=dmap&gt;{{harvnb|Salmieri|Gotthelf|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; the ''[[Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hicks|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Routledge Dictionary of Twentieth-Century Political Thinkers'',&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stevens|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''The Penguin Dictionary of Philosophy''.&lt;ref&gt;Mautner, Thomas. ''The Penguin Dictionary of Philosophy''. Penguin Books, 2000, p. 469.&lt;/ref&gt; A listing of Rand also appears in the ''[[Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'', featuring the assessment, "The influence of Rand's ideas was strongest among college students in the USA but attracted little attention from academic philosophers.

The [[Open Archives Initiative]] '''Protocol for Metadata Harvesting''' ('''OAI-PMH''') is a protocol developed for [[data harvesting|harvest]]ing (or collecting) [[metadata (computing)|metadata]] descriptions of records in an archive so that services can be built using metadata from many archives. An implementation of OAI-PMH must support representing metadata in [[Dublin Core]], but may also support additional representations.&lt;ref name="Breeding"&gt;{{Cite journal |author= Marshall Breeding |date= September 2002 |title= Understanding the Protocol for Metadata Harvesting of the Open Archives Initiative |work= Computers in Libraries |volume=8 |number= 24 |pages= 24–29 |url= http://www.librarytechnology.org/ltg-displaytext.pl?RC=9944 |accessdate= October 11, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The protocol is usually just referred to as the OAI Protocol.

OAI-PMH uses [[XML]] over [[HTTP]]. Version 2.0 of the protocol was released in 2002; the document was last updated in 2015. It has a [[Creative Commons license]] BY-SA.

==History==
&lt;!--This summary was largely drawn from (Lynch, 2001).--&gt;&lt;!-- so use citation --&gt;

In the late 1990s, [[Herbert Van de Sompel]] ([[Ghent University]]) was working with researchers and librarians at [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] (US) and called a meeting to address difficulties related to interoperability issues of e-print servers and [[digital library|digital repositories]]. The meeting was held in [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]], in October 1999. A key development from the meeting was the definition of an interface that permitted e-print servers to expose [[metadata]] for the papers it held in a structured fashion so other repositories could identify and copy papers of interest with each other. This interface/protocol was named the "Santa Fe Convention".&lt;ref name="Breeding"/&gt;

Several workshops were held in 2000 at the ACM Digital Libraries conference&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jcdl.org/ ACM Digital Libraries conference]&lt;/ref&gt; and elsewhere to share the ideas from the Santa Fe Convention. It was discovered at the workshops that the problems faced by the e-print community were also shared by libraries, museums, journal publishers, and others who needed to share distributed resources. To address these needs, the [[Coalition for Networked Information]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cni.org/ Coalition for Networked Information]&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Digital Library Federation]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.diglib.org/ Digital Library Federation]&lt;/ref&gt; provided funding to establish an [[Open Archives Initiative]] (OAI) secretariat managed by Herbert Van de Sompel and Carl Lagoze. The OAI held a meeting at [[Cornell University]] ([[Ithaca, New York]]) in September 2000 to improve the interface developed at the Santa Fe Convention. The specifications were refined over e-mail.

OAI-PMH version 1.0 was introduced to the public in January 2001 at a workshop in [[Washington D.C.]], and another in February in [[Berlin, Germany]]. Subsequent modifications to the [[XML]] standard by the [[W3C]] required making minor modifications to OAI-PMH resulting in version 1.1. The current version, 2.0, was released in June 2002. It contained several technical changes and enhancements and is not backward compatible.

==Registries==
The OAI Protocol was adopted by many digital libraries, institutional repositories, and digital archives. Although registration is not mandatory, it is encouraged.

There are several large registries of OAI-compliant repositories:
#[http://www.openarchives.org/Register/BrowseSites The Open Archives list of registered OAI repositories]
#[http://gita.grainger.uiuc.edu/registry/Info.asp The OAI registry at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]
#[https://web.archive.org/web/20060302071423/http://celestial.eprints.org/ The Celestial OAI registry]

#[https://web.archive.org/web/20090628103036/http://www.openarchives.eu/ Openarchives.eu The European Guide to OAI-PMH compliant repositories in the world]

==Uses==
Some commercial [[search engine]]s use OAI-PMH to acquire more resources. [[Google]] initially included support for OAI-PMH when launching sitemaps, however decided to support only the standard XML [[Sitemaps]] format in May 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.com/2008/04/retiring-support-for-oai-pmh-in.html Google Webmaster blog]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, [[Yahoo!]] acquired content from [[OAIster]] ([[University of Michigan]]) that was obtained through metadata harvesting with OAI-PMH. [[Wikimedia Foundation|Wikimedia]] uses an OAI-PMH repository to provide feeds of [[Wikipedia]] and related site updates for search engines and other bulk analysis/republishing endeavors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite document |title=Wikimedia update feed service |url=http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikimedia_update_feed_service |publisher=Wikimedia Meta-Wiki |accessdate=14 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Especially when dealing with thousands of files being harvested every day, OAI-PMH can help in reducing the network traffic and other resource usage by doing incremental harvesting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dlxs.org/docs/13/ancil/harvest.html incremental harvesting]&lt;/ref&gt; NASA's [[Mercury: Metadata Search System]] uses OAI-PMH to index thousands of metadata records from Global Change Master Directory (GCMD) every day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Data sharing and retrieval uses OAI-PMH |author1=R. Devarakonda |author2=G. Palanisamy |author3=J. Green |author4=B. Wilson |year=2010 |journal=Earth Science Informatics |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=1–5 |publisher=Springer Berlin / Heidelberg |doi=10.1007/s12145-010-0073-0}}{{inconsistent citations}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[mod_oai]] project is using OAI-PMH to expose content to web crawlers that is accessible from [[Apache HTTP Server|Apache Web servers]].

==Software==
OAI-PMH is based on a [[client–server]] architecture, in which "harvesters" request information on updated records from "repositories". Requests for data can be based on a datestamp range, and can be restricted to named sets defined by the provider. Data providers are required to provide [[XML]] metadata in [[Dublin Core]] format, and may also provide it in other XML formats.

A number of software systems support the OAI-PMH, including [[Fedora Commons|Fedora]], [[EThOS]] from the [[British Library]], [[EPrints|GNU EPrints]] from the [[University of Southampton]], [[Open Journal Systems]] from the [[Public Knowledge Project]], [[Desire2Learn]], [[DSpace]] from [[MIT]], HyperJournal from the [[University of Pisa]], Digibib from Digibis, [[MyCoRe]], Primo, DigiTool, Rosetta and MetaLib from [[Ex Libris Group|Ex Libris]], ArchivalWare from [http://www.ptfs.com/ PTFS], DOOR &lt;ref&gt;[http://door.sourceforge.net/index.html DOOR]&lt;/ref&gt; from the eLab&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elearninglab.org/ eLab]&lt;/ref&gt; in Lugano, Switzerland, panFMP from the [[PANGAEA (data library)]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.panFMP.org/ panFMP]&lt;/ref&gt; [[SimpleDL]] from Roaring Development, and jOAI.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dlese.org/dds/services/joai_software.jsp jOAI]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Archives==

'''Pancar Merah''' is an [[Islamic talisman]] found among the [[Banjar people]] from South Borneo.&lt;ref&gt;Urang Banjar dan kebudayaannya Author:	M Suriansyah Ideham, Pemerintah {{ISBN|9786022583387}}, p.51&lt;/ref&gt;
It is used to protect and defend the bearer when dealing with people of high status such are tribal leaders or kings.&lt;ref&gt;M. Nur, Maksum and Fahmy, Al Amruzi and Nor, Ipansyah: Jimat Dalam Konsep Magis Masyarakat Banjar, p.38&lt;/ref&gt;

Pancar Merah has a circular shape with a diameter of 50-70 mm, it is made from silver, copper, silver plated copper or brass and is richly engraved on both sides with Arabic scripts.
On the front side a Pancar Merah is usually engraved with the [[99 Names of Allah]] (Al Asma Ul Husna) and the back side is engraved in accordance with the wishes of the talisman`s orderer (fortune, charisma, security, love or similar).

Pancar Merah is made by a skilled person with a high spiritual level, usually a kyai (ulama, sheikh), and it is crafted only in certain times or periods before or after praying or fasting.

The most notable pieces of Pancar Merah were made in desa (village) Dalam Pagar near [[Martapura, South Kalimantan]], Indonesia before World War II.

The '''People's Party of Canada'''  ('''PPC''', {{lang-fr|Parti populaire du Canada}}) is a [[Right-wing politics|right-wing]]  [[List of federal political parties in Canada|federal party]] in [[Canada]] founded by [[Maxime Bernier]] on September 14, 2018, shortly after his resignation from the [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservative Party]]. Bernier is a former [[Conservative Party of Canada leadership election, 2017|Conservative Party leadership candidate]], cabinet minister and the first leader of the party. He has announced plans to form electoral district associations across the country and after they are completed to run a full slate of candidates in the upcoming elections.

==History==

=== Formation ===
The People's Party of Canada was launched a few weeks after the resignation of Maxime Bernier from the Conservative Party of Canada. In his resignation speech, Bernier stated he left the party as a result of disagreements with Conservative leader [[Andrew Scheer]], to whom Bernier finished runner-up in the [[Conservative Party of Canada leadership election, 2017|2017 Conservative Party leadership election]]. He cited issues such as [[Immigration to Canada|immigration]], [[Corporate welfare|corporate welfare]], [[Equalization payments in Canada|equalization]] reform, and [[supply management (Canada)|supply management]] as examples.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://nationalpost.com/news/politics/sfull-text-of-maxime-berniers-speech?utm_term=Autofeed&amp;utm_campaign=Echobox&amp;utm_medium=Social&amp;utm_source=Twitter#Echobox=1535049163|title=Read the full text of Maxime Bernier’s speech: ‘Scheer keeps talking about his positive Conservative vision. But nobody knows what that is’|date=2018-08-23|work=National Post|access-date=2018-09-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bernier expressed frustration with the party, stating "I've come to realize this party is too intellectually and morally corrupt to be reformed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/bernier-quits-conservatives-to-start-new-party-1.4064855|title=Bernier quits Conservatives to start new party|date=23 August 2018|work=CTVNews|accessdate=14 September 2018|language=en-CA}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later told [[Vassy Kapelos]] that his party will debate discussions that "the leadership and the caucus" did not want to have when he was a party member.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/bernier-departure-conservatives-didn-t-tell-1.4797877|title=Bernier didn't tell anyone from the Conservative Party about his dramatic exit {{!}} CBC News|work=CBC|access-date=2018-10-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;In a ''[[National Post]]'' op-ed, Bernier stated that his motive for forming the party was to reverse the "[[Public choice|public choice dynamic]]" in the Canadian political system resulting in vote-buying and pandering by prominent political parties in Canada. Bernier reiterated his belief that the Conservative Party cannot be reformed to end this practice and that a new political party is required.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://nationalpost.com/opinion/maxime-bernier-why-my-new-political-movement-because-canada-has-been-hijacked|title=Maxime Bernier: Why my new political movement? Because Canada has been hijacked|date=2018-08-31|work=National Post|access-date=2018-09-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bernier was accused by prominent [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservative]] politicians such as former [[List of Prime Ministers of Canada|prime ministers]] [[Stephen Harper]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2018/08/23/stephen-harper-maxime-bernier_a_23508214/|title=Stephen Harper Calls Out Maxime Bernier As A Sore Loser|date=2018-08-23|work=HuffPost Canada|access-date=2018-10-18|language=en-CA}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Brian Mulroney]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://ipolitics.ca/2018/09/11/berniers-departure-from-tories-will-make-it-harder-to-beat-trudeau-former-pm/|title=Bernier's departure from Tories will make it harder to beat Trudeau: former PM - iPolitics|date=2018-09-11|work=iPolitics|access-date=2018-10-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; of trying to divide the political right. Bernier responded to [[Power and Politics]] that he wanted to focus on the disaffected voters stating that "there is 20 per cent of the population who do not even bother to vote." and cited the political rise of [[President of France|French President]] [[Emmanuel Macron]] as an example.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.lapresse.ca/actualites/politique/politique-canadienne/201808/24/01-5194184-maxime-bernier-jaimerais-bien-etre-le-macron-canadien.php|title=Maxime Bernier: «J'aimerais bien être le Macron canadien» {{!}} Mylène Crête {{!}} Politique canadienne|date=2018-08-24|work=La Presse|access-date=2018-10-18|language=fr-CA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/maxime-bernier-peoples-party-registration-1.4856793|title=Maxime Bernier files to officially register the People's Party of Canada {{!}} CBC News|work=CBC|access-date=2018-10-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later Bernier cited the break through of the [[People's Alliance of New Brunswick]] in the [[New Brunswick general election, 2018|2018 New Brunswick election]] and the [[Coalition Avenir Québec]] win in [[Quebec general election, 2018|2018 Quebec elections]] as examples of voters disdaining traditional parties and a desire for change by wanting to vote for new parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/maxime-bernier-peoples-party-registration-1.4856793|title=Maxime Bernier files to officially register the People's Party of Canada {{!}} CBC News|work=CBC|access-date=2018-10-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ici.radio-canada.ca/tele/les-coulisses-du-pouvoir/site/segments/entrevue/90677/maxime-bernier|title=Le parti de Maxime Bernier prend forme {{!}} Segment {{!}} Les coulisses du pouvoir {{!}} ICI Radio-Canada.ca|last=Médias|first=Groupe des Nouveaux|website=Radio-Canada|language=fr-ca|access-date=2018-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to his resignation from the Conservative party, Bernier had began re-establishing contact with individuals who supported his 2017 Conservative leadership bid. [[Le Devoir]] reported that  Members of seven Conservative constituency associations defected to the party.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ledevoir.com/politique/canada/538193/parti-progressiste-conservateur-bernier-debauche-six-presidents-d-association-au-quebec|title=Maxime Bernier débauche des organisateurs conservateurs au Québec|website=Le Devoir|language=fr|access-date=2018-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Individuals close to Bernier stated they believed Bernier had the necessary support to register a party with [[Elections Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Rabson |first1=Janice Dickson and Mia |title=Bernier has enough support to go forward with new party, source says |url=https://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/bernier-has-enough-support-to-go-forward-with-new-party-source-says-1.4066238 |work=CTVNews |date=24 August 2018 |language=en-CA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Few days after announcing his party name,  Libertarian Party leader [[Tim Moen]] remains open to the idea of a merger with the People's Party which could accelerate the party's fundraising efforts and nominated candidates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/bernier-libertarian-party-merger-1.4827241|title=Libertarian Party considering a merger with Bernier's People's Party {{!}} CBC News|work=CBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn| Libertarian leader [[Tim Moen]] had offered to step aside for Bernier following the results of the 2017 Conservative leadership race and adopted Bernier’s platform.}} However, Bernier reaffirmed he has no interest in a merger when asked ''by Global News''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://globalnews.ca/news/4464574/maxime-bernier-peoples-party-of-canada-name/|title=‘I am not a communist’: Maxime Bernier doubles down on People’s Party name amid criticism|work=Global News|access-date=2018-09-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; When asked about organizing his party, Bernier mentioned that he will use tools that did not exist in the past, such as the use of social media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.lapresse.ca/actualites/politique/politique-canadienne/201809/14/01-5196564-maxime-bernier-lance-le-parti-populaire-du-canada.php|title=Maxime Bernier lance le Parti populaire du Canada {{!}} JOËL-DENIS BELLAVANCE {{!}} Politique canadienne|date=2018-09-14|work=La Presse|access-date=2018-09-17|language=fr-CA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://ipolitics.ca/2018/09/13/bernier-using-social-media-to-rally-supporters-in-his-peoples-network/|title=Bernier using social media to rally supporters in his People's Network - iPolitics|date=2018-09-13|work=iPolitics|access-date=2018-09-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|by asking his followers on [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]] to join regional groups to form what he is calling The People’s Network.

The '''[[political philosophy]] of [[Immanuel Kant]]''' (1724–1804) favoured a [[Classical republicanism|classical republican]] approach.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://oll.libertyfund.org/index.php?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php&amp;title=358 Kant’s Principles of Politics, including his essay on Perpetual Peace. A Contribution to Political Science]'', translation by W. Hastie, Edinburgh: Clark, 1891.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Perpetual Peace: A Philosophical Sketch]]'' (1795), Kant listed several conditions that he thought necessary for ending wars and creating a lasting peace. They included a world of constitutional republics  by establishment of political [[community]].&lt;ref&gt;Kant, Immanuel. ''Perpetual Peace''. Trans. Lewis White Beck (377). For a summary and&lt;/ref&gt; His [[classical republicanism|classical republican]] theory was extended in ''Doctrine of Right'' (1797), the first part of ''[[Metaphysics of Morals]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Manfred Riedel]] ''Between Tradition and Revolution: The Hegelian Transformation of Political Philosophy'', Cambridge 1984&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the 20th century Kant's political philosophy had been enjoying a remarkable renaissance in English-speaking countries with more major studies in a few years than had appeared in the preceding many decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Kant's Political Philosophy: Rechtsstaat or Council Democracy?|jstor = 1406673|journal = The Review of Politics|date = 1985-04-01|pages = 253–280|volume = 47|issue = 2|first = A. Anthony|last = Smith|doi=10.1017/s003467050003672x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Kant's most significant contribution to political philosophy and the [[philosophy of law]] is the doctrine of ''[[Rechtsstaat]]''. According to this doctrine, the power of the state is limited in order to protect [[citizen]]s from the arbitrary exercise of [[authority]]. The ''Rechtsstaat'' ({{lang-de|[[:de:Rechtsstaat|Rechtsstaat]]}}) is a concept in [[continental Europe]]an legal thinking, originally borrowed from [[Germany|German]] [[jurisprudence]], which can be translated as "the legal state" or "state of rights". It is a  "constitutional [[State (polity)|state]]" in which the exercise of [[government]]al power is constrained by the [[law]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Carl Schmitt]], ''The Concept of the Political'', ch. 7; ''Crisis of Parliamentary Democracy''&lt;/ref&gt; and is often tied to the [[Anglo-America]]n concept of the [[rule of law]]. Kant's political philosophy has been described as [[liberalism|liberal]] for its presumption of limits on the state based on the [[social contract]] as a regulative matter.&lt;ref&gt;• Gerald Gaus and Shane D. Courtland,  2011, [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/liberalism/  "Liberalism"], 1.1, ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy''.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; • Immanuel Kant, ([1797]). ''[[The Metaphysics of Morals]]'', Part 1), Bobbs-Merrill.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a ''Rechtsstaat'', the citizens share legally based [[civil liberties]] and they can use the [[court]]s. A country cannot be a [[liberal democracy]] without first being a ''Rechtsstaat''. German writers usually place [[Immanuel Kant]]'s theories at the beginning of their accounts of the movement toward the ''Rechtsstaat''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Friedrich Hayek]], ''[[The Constitution of Liberty]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Rechtsstaat'' in the meaning of "constitutional state" was introduced in the latest works of Immanuel Kant after US and French constitutions were adopted in the late 18th century.  Kant’s approach is based on the supremacy of a country’s written constitution. This supremacy must create guarantees for implementation of his central idea:  a permanent peaceful life as a basic condition for the happiness of its people and their prosperity.  Kant was basing his doctrine on none other but [[constitutionalism]] and constitutional government. Kant had thus formulated the main problem of constitutionalism, “The constitution of a state is eventually based on the morals of its citizens, which, in its turns, is based on the goodness of this constitution.”{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}  Kant’s idea is the foundation for the constitutional theory of the twenty century.

The ''Rechtsstaat'' concept is based on the ideas, discovered by Immanuel Kant, for example, in his ''[[Groundwork of the Metaphysic of Morals]]'': "The task of establishing a universal and permanent peaceful life is not only a part of the theory of law within the framework of pure reason, but per se an absolute and ultimate goal. To achieve this goal, a state must become the community of a large number of people, living provided with legislative guarantees of their property rights secured by a common constitution. The supremacy of this constitution… must be derived a priori from the considerations for achievement of the absolute ideal in the most just and fair organization of people’s life under the aegis of public law."&lt;ref&gt;Immanuel Kant, in ''History of Political Philosophy'', edited by [[Leo Strauss]] and [[Joseph Cropsey]], University of Chicago Press, Chicago and London, 1987&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of the ''Rechtsstaat'' appeared in the German context in [[Robert von Mohl]]'s book ''Die deutsche Polizeiwissenschaft nach den Grundsätzen des Rechtsstaates'' ("German police science according to the principles of the constitutional state", 1832–1834), and was contrasted with the [[Aristocracy|aristocratic]] [[police state]].

Kant opposed "democracy"{{spaced ndash}}which, in that era, meant [[direct democracy]]{{spaced ndash}}believing that [[majority rule]] posed a threat to individual liberty. He stated, "…democracy is, properly speaking, necessarily a despotism, because it establishes an executive power in which "all" decide for or even against one who does not agree; that is, "all", who are not quite all, decide, and this is a contradiction of the general will with itself and with freedom."&lt;ref&gt;Kant, Immanuel. ''Perpetual Peace''. Trans. Lewis White Beck (352).&lt;/ref&gt; As most writers at the time he distinguished three forms of government: democracy, aristocracy, and monarchy with [[mixed government]] as the most ideal form of government.

A distinctive feature of Kant's political philosophy is his conviction that the university should be a model of creative conflict: the philosopher's role within the university should be to "police" the higher faculties (which in his day were theology, law and medicine), making sure their teaching conforms to the principles of reason; likewise, the goal of perpetual peace in society can be achieved only when the rulers consult with philosophers on a regular basis.&lt;ref&gt;For an explanation and defense of these two aspects of Kant's political theory, see Stephen Palmquist's essays: [http://www.hkbu.edu.hk/~ppp/srp/arts/KIUMWP.htm "Kant's Ideal of the University as a Model for World Peace"], in ''Papers of International Conference on Two Hundred Years after Kant'' (Tehran, Iran: Allame Tabataba'i University Press, 2005), pp.207-222; and [http://www.hkbu.edu.hk/~ppp/srp/arts/PSAP.htm "The Philosopher as a 'Secret Agent' for Peace: Taking Seriously Kant's Revival of the 'Old Question'"], in Valerio Rohden, Ricardo R. Terra and Guido A. de Almeida (eds.), ''Recht und Frieden in der Philosophie Kants'', vol. 4 of ''Akten des X. Internationalen Kant-Kongresses'' (Berlin: Walter de Gruyter, 2008), pp.601-612.&lt;/ref&gt;

beginning historical record during [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]], in the 8th century BC.

== Paleolithic ==

One of the potential routes for early human migrations toward southern and eastern Asia is Iran, a country characterized by a wide range of geographic variation and resources, which could support early groups of hominins who wandered into the region. Evidence for the presence of these early populations in Iran includes some stone artifacts discovered from gravel deposits along the [[Kashafrud]] River Basin in eastern Iran, the Mashkid and Ladiz Rivers in the southeast, the [[Sefidrud]] River in the north, the [[Mahabad]] River in the northwest, and some surface occurrences and isolated finds from the west and northwestern parts of the country.

The main known early human occupation sites in Iran are: [[Kashafrud]] in Khorasan, Mashkid and Ladiz in Sistan, Shiwatoo in [[Kurdistan]], [[Ganj Par]] in Gilan, [[Darband Cave]] in Gilan, Khaleseh in Zanjan, Tepe Gakia ({{coord|34|13|N|47|13|E}}) {{cvt|14|km|mi}} due east of [[Kermanshah]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=PmTOT7xp4b4C&amp;pg=PA15&amp;lpg=PA15&amp;dq=gakia+tepe&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=B0mp8djW20&amp;sig=3FfPep-4J97sHfnvvbq_p2ga_ZM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjB7vvQ95rXAhWrDMAKHXQQAFYQ6AEIVDAH#v=onepage&amp;q=gakia%20tepe&amp;f=false |title=Views of the Past: Essays in Old World Prehistory and Paleanthropology |editor-first=Leslie G. |editor-last=Freeman |page=15 |date=1978 |publisher=[[Mouton de Gruyter]] |isbn=978-3111769974 |accessdate=31 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pal Barik in Ilam. These sites fall between one million years ago to 200,000 years ago.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

[[Mousterian]] Stone tools made by [[Neanderthal]] man have also been found in various parts of the country.There are more cultural remains of [[Neanderthal]] man dating back to the [[Middle Paleolithic]] period, which mainly have been found in the Zagros region and fewer in central Iran at sites such as Kobeh, Kaldar, [[Bisitun Cave|Bisetun]], [[Qaleh Bozi]], Tamtama, [[Warwasi]]. In 1949 a Neanderthal radius was discovered by CS Coon in [[Bisitun Cave]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Trinkaus, E  |author2=Biglari, F.  |lastauthoramp=yes |url=https://www.academia.edu/224543/Trinkaus_E_and_F._Biglari_2006_Middle_Paleolithic_Human_Remains_from_Bisitun_Cave_Iran_Paleorient_32.2_105-1|year=2006|title= Middle Paleolithic Human Remains from Bisitun Cave, Iran|journal= Paleorient|volume= 32|issue=2|pages= 105–111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence for [[Upper Paleolithic]] and [[Epipaleolithic]] periods are known mainly from the [[Zagros]] region in the caves of [[Kermanshah]] and [[Khoramabad]] such as [[Yafteh]] Cave and a few number of sites in the Alborz range and Central Iran. In October 2018  a tooth belonging to a [[Neanderthal]] child has been discovered in Iran for the first time. The tooth belongs to a six-year-old child that was found along with some rocky tools of the middle Paleolithic period in the mountains of [[Kermanshah]] province.&lt;ref&gt;https://ifpnews.com/exclusive/first-neanderthal-human-tooth-discovered-in-iran/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Epipaleolithic ==
{{main|Epipalaeolithic Near East}}
The end of the Palaeolithic, called  [[Epipalaeolithic Near East|Epipalaeolithic]], is in a period of about 7000 years from c. 18,000 to 11,000 BC. In those days groups of hunter-gatherers were mostly living in the caves of the Zagros Mountains. Compared to earlier groups of game hunters, a tendency towards increasing the number of the kinds of plants and animals, which were collected and hunted, can be observed. Not only smaller vertebrates were hunted but also pistachios and wild fruit were collected. Finally, consuming snails and smaller aquatic animals like crabs is new (Flannery 1973).
[[File:Ganj dareh.jpg|thumb|right|Map showing location of Ganj Dareh and other early Neolithic sites in western Zagros.]]

==Neolithic to Chalcolithic==
Almost nothing is known about the 2500 years which followed the Epipalaeolithic after 11,000 BC. Only when discovering the place of [[Tepe Asiab|Asiab]] (c. 8500-8000) in the [[Kermanshah]] area we are in better known periods. Asiab was a small camp of hunter-gatherers, only seasonally inhabited. Besides the fact that wild goats and sheep were hunted, great numbers of snail shells were found. These finds were interpreted in the way that from time to time the hunting activities of the inhabitants of Asiab were unsuccessful and that then they were forced to consume food which they usually did not like.

Some nearby and more constantly occupied settlements in the Zagros date from a short time after Asiab, from the time between 8,000 and 6,800 BC. Still the material culture of Tappeh [[Ganj Dareh]]
and Tappeh Abdul Hosein does not include any pottery. Thus this period is often called “aceramic Neolithic”. This is also true for the oldest levels of Tappeh Guran, located in Luristan, as well as for the sites of Ali Kosh and Chogha Sefid in the plain of Deh Luran, west of the Zagros Mountains. There, flocks of sheep and herds of goats were kept for the first time. Managing animals meant a fundamentally new orientation of the Neolithic inhabitants of Iran and must be understood to be connected with a whole number of other innovations, particularly the architecture of houses. We do not definitely know if in those days there was any cultivation of cereals. Tools for harvesting and for making cereal products are there, but remnants of burned grain are extremely rare.

In the eighth millennium BC, agricultural communities such as [[Chogha Bonut]] (the earliest village in Susiana)&lt;ref&gt;''[http://oi.uchicago.edu/research/pubs/nn/spr97_alizadeh.html EXCAVATIONS AT CHOGHA BONUT: THE EARLIEST VILLAGE IN SUSIANA, IRAN]'', by [[Abbas Alizadeh]] – The Oriental Institute and the Department of Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations The University of Chicago&lt;/ref&gt; started to form in western Iran, either as a result of indigenous development or of outside influences. Around about the same time the earliest known clay vessels and modeled human and animal terracotta figurines were produced at Ganj Dareh and Teppe Sarab, also in western Iran.&lt;ref name=MMA&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/ht/02/wai/ht02wai.htm |title=Iran, 8000–2000 BC |accessdate=2008-08-09 |work=The Timeline of Art History |publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art |date=October 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Museum&gt;[http://www.pbase.com/k_amj/tehran_museum retrieved PERSIA the ANCIENT IRAN ].

The general perception among archeologists is that Susa was an extension of the Sumerian city state of Uruk.&lt;ref&gt;Algaze, Guillermo. 2005.  The Uruk World System: The Dynamics of Expansion of Early Mesopotamian Civilization&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://oi.uchicago.edu/pdf/saoc63.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  In its later history, Susa became the capital of Elam, which emerged as a state found 4000 BC.&lt;ref name="Elam pp. 45-46"/&gt; There are also dozens of [[prehistory|prehistoric]] sites across the Iranian plateau pointing to the existence of ancient cultures and urban settlements in the fourth millennium BC,&lt;ref name="xinhuaciv" /&gt; One of the earliest civilizations in Iranian plateau was the [[Jiroft culture]] in southeastern Iran in the province of [[Kerman]].

There are records of numerous other ancient civilizations on the [[Iranian Plateau]] before the emergence of [[Iranian peoples]] during the [[Early Iron Age]]. The [[Early Bronze Age]] saw the rise of urbanization into organized city states and the invention of writing (the [[Uruk period]]) in the Near East. While Bronze Age [[Elam]] made use of writing from an early time, the [[Proto-Elamite#Proto-Elamite script|Proto-Elamite script]] remains undeciphered, and records from [[Sumer]] pertaining to Elam are scarce.

Russian historian [[Igor M. Diakonoff]] states that the modern inhabitants of the Iranian Plateau are descendants of mainly non-Persian groups: "It is the autochthones of the Iranian plateau, and not the Proto-Indo-European tribes of Europe, which are, in the main, the ancestors, in the physical sense of the word, of the present-day Iranians."&lt;ref&gt;Diakonoff, I., M., "Media", Cambridge History of Iran, II, Cambridge, 1985, p.43 [within the pp.36–148].

Records become more tangible with the rise of the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]] and its records of incursions from the Iranian plateau.
As early as the 20th century BC, tribes came to the Iranian Plateau from the [[Pontic–Caspian steppe]]. The arrival of Iranians on the Iranian plateau forced the [[Elam]]ites to relinquish one area of their empire after another and to take refuge in Elam, [[History of Khuzestan Province|Khuzestan]] and the nearby area, which only then became coterminous with Elam.&lt;ref name="Elam"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Lackenbacher |first=Sylvie | encyclopedia = Encyclopædia Iranica|title=Elam|accessdate=2008-06-23|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/elam-vii}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bahman Firuzmandi say that the southern Iranians might be intermixed with the Elamite peoples living in the plateau.&lt;ref&gt;^ Bahman Firuzmandi "Mad, Hakhamanishi, Ashkani, Sasani" pp. 20&lt;/ref&gt;
By the mid-first millennium BC, [[Medes]], [[Persian people|Persians]], and [[Parthia]]ns populated the Iranian plateau. Until the rise of the Medes, they all remained under [[Assyria]]n domination, like the rest of the [[Near East]]. In the first half of the first millennium BC, parts of what is now [[Azerbaijan (Iran)|Iranian Azerbaijan]] were incorporated into [[Urartu]].

[[File:Frederick Douglass, head-and-shoulders portrait, facing right, ca 1850-1860 edit.jpg|thumb|Frederick Douglass, photographed between 1850 and 1860.]]
'''''Self-Made Men''''' is a famous lecture (1895). In this speech, which was first delivered in 1859, [[Frederick Douglass]] gives his own definition of the self-made man and explains what he thinks are the means to become such a man.

The concept of the self-made man is deeply rooted in the [[American Dream]]. [[Benjamin Franklin]], one of the [[Founding Fathers of the United States]], is sometimes said to have created the concept of the self-made man. In his ''Autobiography'', he describes his way from a poor, unknown son of a candle-maker to a very successful business man and highly acknowledged member of the American society. Franklin creates the archetype of someone coming from low origins, who, against all odds, breaks out of his inherited social position, climbs up the social ladder and creates a new identity for himself. Key factors in this rise from rags to riches are hard work and a solid moral foundation. Franklin also stresses the significance of education for self-improvement.

==Douglass' View==

Douglass stresses the low origins of the self-made man, who has not inherited his social position by birth or other favourable circumstances, but who achieves everything without any outside assistance:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Self-made men […] are the men who owe little or nothing to birth, relationship, friendly surroundings; to wealth inherited or to early approved means of education; who are what they are, without the aid of any of the favoring conditions by which other men usually rise in the world and achieve great results. (pp549-50)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In addition, Douglass does not believe in what he calls the "good luck theory" (p552), which attributes success to chance and friendly circumstances. He believes that "opportunity is important but exertion is indispensable" (p553). It is not luck that makes a man a self-made man, but considerable physical and mental effort. Similar to Franklin's virtue of industry, Douglass underlines the importance of hard work as a necessary means to achieve success. He remarks that "there is nothing good, great or desirable […], that does not come by some kind of labor" (p555). Douglass is convinced that success can be explained by only one word, namely "work!" (p556)

He further argues that there is a natural hierarchy of men. An ambitious man will naturally, through hard work, climb the social ladder, whereas the unmotivated man will not improve his position: "the man who will get up will be helped up; and the man who will not get up will be allowed to stay down" (p557). Applying this theory to the situation of the African-Americans, Douglass remarks: "Give the negro fair play and let him alone. If he lives, well. If he dies, equally well. If he cannot stand up, let him fall down." (p557)

Yet, Douglass admits that industry is not the only explanation of the phenomenon of the self-made man. In his opinion, necessity is what urges a man to achieve more. Moreover, favourable circumstances are counterproductive to one's resolution to get ahead. Ease and luxury rather lead to helplessness and inactivity and an inactive man can never become a self-made man. "As a general rule, where circumstances do most for men there man will do least for himself; and where man does least, he himself is least. His doing makes or unmakes him."(p558) However, though acknowledging that there are other factors for success such as "order, the first law of heaven" (562), Douglass insists that hard work is the most important of them all, without which all others would fail:

&lt;blockquote&gt;My theory of self-made men is, then, simply this; that they are men of work. Whether or not such men have acquired material, moral or intellectual excellence, honest labor faithfully, steadily and persistently pursued, is the best, if not the only, explanation of their success. (p560)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Thus, like Franklin, Douglass arrives at his moral principles. According to him, "the principles of honor, integrity and affection" (p561) are the essential prerequisite for enduring success:

&lt;blockquote&gt;All human experience proves over and over again, that any success which comes through meanness, trickery, fraud and dishonour, is but emptiness and will only be a torment to its possessor. (p561) 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Differences between Douglass and Franklin==

Despite all these similarities between Douglass' and Franklin's concept of the self-made man, the two men differ in their emphasis on relationships to other men. Before Douglass even gives his definition of the self-made man, he remarks, "Properly speaking, there are in the world no such men as self-made men." (p549)

&lt;blockquote&gt;It must in truth be said though it may not accord well with self-conscious individuality and self-conceit, that no possible native force of character, and no depth or wealth of originality, can lift a man into absolute independence of his fellow-men, and no generation of men can be independent of the preceding generation. (p549) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Whereas Franklin does not put a strong emphasis on relationships, for Douglass, they are a matter of the utmost importance. Douglass understands himself as part of a larger entity and highlights what he calls the "brotherhood and inter-dependence of mankind" (p549). Comparing the relationship between an individual and the masses to that between a wave and the ocean, Douglass explains that, though we differ like the waves, we all depend on each other and the power and greatness of each individual derives exactly from this interdependence. Since all men complement each other in their abilities and strengths, Douglass further argues that "the balance of power is kept comparatively even, and a self-acting brotherhood and interdependence is maintained." (p549)

'''Soviet Orientalist studies in Islam''' are academic discourses by [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Marxism|Marxist]] theoreticians about [[Islam]], its origins and development based on [[historical materialism]] and [[Muslims]]. The central question of this discourse was how Muslim society would fit into the general [[World History|development of human history]]. Prominent Soviet [[Oriental studies|orientalists]] include Mikhail A. Reisner, Evgenii Beliaev, Liutsian I. Klimovich, Mikhail L. Tomara, V. Ditiakin and Sandzhar D. Asfendiarov.&lt;ref name="The Soviet Discourse on the Origin and
Class Character of Islam, 1923-1933"&gt;[http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/brill/dwi/2009/00000049/00000001], Die Welt des Islams, Volume 49, Number 1, 2009 , pp. 1-48(48)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The [[October Revolution]] brought the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] to power. The Soviet Union had a large [[Islam in the Soviet Union|Muslim population]] of various ethnicities. Therefore, there was a pressing need for original research as [[Karl Marx|Marx]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1853/letters/53_06_02.htm], Marx To Engels In Manchester.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Friedrich Engels|Engels]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1853/letters/53_06_06.htm], Engels To Marx In London.&lt;/ref&gt; only dealt with the subject superficially. In the 1920s, the Bolsheviks created new institutions and organizations intended to produce devoted Marxist scholars of Oriental studies. Foremost among them was the [[Moscow Institute of Oriental Studies|Moscow Institute for Oriental Studies]], a [[Communist Party|party]] school created in 1920 mainly for the requirements of the Soviet foreign service. Its counterpart for educating party workers and administrators from the Eastern regions and republics of Russia and the USSR, as well as for training communists from abroad, was the [[Communist University of the Toilers of the East|Communist University of the Toilers of the Orient]], a school founded in 1921. The new Marxist discourse on Islam was dominated by scholars from these political teaching and research institutions.

==Communist theory of Islam==
In 1923, Zinatullah Navshirvanov (a Volga Tatar communist who was also active in the formation of a communist party in Atatürk's new Republic of Turkey) in the journal Novyi Vostok&lt;ref&gt;“Kommunisticheskie techeniia v istorii musul’manskoi kul’tury”, in: Novyi Vostok No. 4 (1923), 274-279.&lt;/ref&gt; proposed that there were several forms of communism in Islamic history. The authors detected a “primitive communism” already in the activities of some of [[Sahaba|Muhammad's companions]], but they found that communism was even more prominent in the tradition of Islamic [[Sufism]]. Under the cover of Sufism communist ideas and movements emerged that had nothing to do with Islam and religion whatsoever. These movements were driven by Muslims—poor [[nomad]]s as well as [[peasant]]s and [[Artisan|urban craftsmen]]—longing to overthrow the [[Feudalism|feudal order]] of their times, i.e., the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid]], [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljukid]], and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman dynasties]] in the [[Near East]]. As examples the Navshirvanovs mentioned the [[Shiism|Shiʿi]] [[Ismailism|Ismailites]], the Anatolian Futūwa and Akhī organizations, and the [[Bektashi|Bektashi order of dervishes]]. The climax of this supposed anti-feudal Sufi communist movement was [[Sheikh Bedreddin]] of Simavna who was executed by the Ottomans in 1416 as a heretic; his disciples led peasant rebellions against Ottoman rule and set up what the Navshirvanov called the “first revolutionary government of Anatolia”.&lt;ref name="test"&gt;Navshirvanovy, “Kommunisticheskie techeniia”, 276-278 ff. Cf. Ahmet N. Cerrahoğlu, Şeyh Bedreddin ve Türkiye’de sosyalizm hareketleri (Istanbul, 1966).&lt;/ref&gt;

This theory suffered from lack of sufficient historical evidence and was superseded by other theories.

==Trade capitalism theory==
Mikhail A. Reisner (Michael von Reusner, 1868–1928), ethnic German historian of law and publicist produced a detailed Marxist analysis of the [[Koran]] from the perspective of [[social studies]]. His interpretation of Islam can be found in two articles on “The Koran and Its Social Ideology”, published in 1926 in a Soviet literary journal.&lt;ref&gt;M. Reisner, “Koran i ego sotsial’naia ideologiia”, part I, in: Krasnaia nov’, 1926, vol.8, 134-149; continuation as part II in: Krasnaia nov’, 1926, vol. 9, 146-164. were later included in his comparative book on “Eastern Ideologies”: M. Reisner, Ideologii vostoka: Ocherki vostochnoi teokratii (Moscow; Leningrad, 1927).&lt;/ref&gt; In these studies Reisner maintained that Islam was the religion of the Arab merchants of [[Mecca]]. He distinguished between the big merchants, that is, the rich families of Mecca, and the less affluent and poor merchant families. Due to the disunion of the [[Tribes of Arabia|Arab tribes]], [[Trade route|trade caravans]] were constantly running the risk of being raided by nomads. These [[Convoy|caravan]]s were organized as joint ventures of rich and less affluent trade families of the [[Quraysh (tribe)|Quraysh]] tribe, but the poorer merchants invested, and therefore risked, a higher percentage of their capital than the rich families. For this reason the idea of a union of the [[Arab tribes]] under one [[monotheism|monotheistic religion]] was developed by the poorer families of the Quraysh, for only such a union would eliminate the raids. Their speaker became Muhammad, who himself hailed from one of the [[Banu Hashim|less privileged Quraysh clans]].&lt;ref&gt;Reisner, “Koran”, part I, 135f.&lt;/ref&gt;

Reisner maintains that the Koran portrayed [[Allah]] as "a rich, powerful and smart [[Capitalism|capitalist]]".&lt;ref&gt;Reisner, “Koran”, part I, 140ff.; for God as “the mighty heavenly capitalist” see ibid., 144.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Medina]], Muhammad acted not so much as a prophet and preacher but as a skillful organizer. He was successful not because people were eager to join a new religion but because they longed for a [[Sharia|law]] that would unite them.&lt;ref&gt;Reisner, “Koran”, part I, 136.&lt;/ref&gt; The Koran, Reisner continues, only guarantees the [[right to property]] and creates a “World Trade Company of Believers” (mirovaia torgovaia kompaniia veruiushchikh) under God's own leadership. Many elements in the Koran reflect a merchant's position: the prayers and rituals are not very complex and do not require “spiritual contortions”; the [[pilgrimage]] to Mecca ([[ḥajj]]) is linked to a trade fair; [[tithe]]s ([[zakāt]]) is restricted to a moderate level, and believers are exhorted not to squander their money; while [[riba|usury]] is forbidden, Muslims are encouraged to make moderate profits; and, of course, the Koran emphasizes the importance of oaths, correct measurements, and the faithful return of the deposit.&lt;ref&gt;Reisner, “Koran”, part II, 155-158.&lt;/ref&gt;

Reisner explains that mystical elements, which tended to supersede the clear class distinctions, were to enter Islam only much later, mainly stemming from the Persian tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Reisner, “Koran”, part II, 161&lt;/ref&gt;

Reisner's interpretation turned out to be very influential among Soviet scholars of the late 1920s.

===Beliaev’s modification of trade capitalism theory===
Evgenii Beliaev (1895–1964) was the only professional trained in Oriental languages among all participants in the early Soviet discourse on Islam. In his contribution to the 1930 special issue of ''Ateist'' on the origins of Islam, Beliaev argued that Islam emerged from the merchant environment of Mecca.&lt;ref&gt;Evg. Beliaev, “Rol’ mekkanskogo torgovogo kapitala v istorii proiskhozhdeniia islama”, in: Ateist no. 58 (November 1930), 48-60.&lt;/ref&gt; The pagan religion served the purpose of trade, and the authority of the gods in the [[kaaba]] grew with the wealth of the merchants. Islam emerged in the late 6th century as a movement of the less wealthy, “intermediary and lower Meccan bourgeoisie” against this “‘aristocracy’ of avaricious traders and pitiless usurers.”&lt;ref&gt;Beliaev, “Rol’ mekkanskogo torgovogo kapitala”, 54.&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to Reisner, however, Beliaev did not see anything progressive, liberating, or even revolutionary in this initial Islam: for instance, Islam did not stand up against slavery. Beliaev compared the image of God in the Koran to that of a despot and slave owner.&lt;ref&gt;Beliaev, “Rol’ mekkanskogo torgovogo kapitala”, 51, 55, 57.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Beliav, a similar struggle was taking place in Medina, where some clans became dependant upon others, and especially upon the [[Judaism|Jewish]] [[Jewish tribes of Arabia|clans]], whose wealth was based on “[[Usury|usury capital]]” (rostovshchicheskii kapital). The gradual dissolution of the ancient tribal and clan structures in Muslim Medina must not be ascribed to the religion of Islam but rather to the development of Meccan trade capital, and in general to the transition to private property in slaves, cattle, and other possessions. “With an eagerness and love for detail that is characteristic for the petty bourgeoisie, the boring, depressing and dull Suras of the Medinan period lay down the regulations for property and inheritance as well as buying and selling”.In Medina Muhammad changed the [[qibla|prayer direction]] from [[Jerusalem]] to Mecca; “praying to the Muslim God, they bow down before the only god that they respect, namely capital.” When the “medium wealthy” traders finally took over Mecca, they reached their goal: together with the rich “Quraysh of the Center” they found themselves at the helm of the “trade capitalist organization of the Hijaz” which eventually united the tribes of Arabia. The nomads, by contrast, did not play an active role in Beliaev's scenario; after Muhammad's death they easily committed [[Apostasy in Islam|apostasy]] and had to be forced back to Islam by the first caliph, [[Abu Bakr]].&lt;ref&gt;Beliaev, “Rol’ mekkanskogo torgovogo kapitala”, 58ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ditiakin==
V. Ditiakin, an expert on the history of Marxism, took as his starting point the works of Marx and Engels instead of Islamic tradition, nor Western Oriental studies or even Reisner. Ditiakin conceded that Marx and Engels had only limited sources at their disposal and never devoted a special study to Islam; nevertheless he believed they came to important insights on this topic.

According to Ditiakin, Marx and Engels understood that [[pre-Islamic Arabia]] was characterized by two different environments, that of nomadic [[Bedouin]]s and that of settled urban traders. As the correspondences of the two thinkers show, the Bedouins could hardly be characterized as bearers of high culture, whereas the population of the southwestern Arabian peninsula was a “civilized” Oriental high culture. Obviously, Engels had access to publications on [[petroglyphs]] from [[Yemen]], which, in his mind, reflected “the ancient, national Arabic tradition of monotheism”. However, in the centuries immediately before Muhammad the old culture of Yemen was destroyed by incursions of the [[Ethiopia]]ns, and consequently also the Arabian trade route to the north via Mecca was in decay. This decline of trade in the period before Muhammad was, as Engels wrote to Marx in 1853, “one of the chief factors in the Muhammadan revolution”.&lt;ref&gt;Ditiakin, “Marks i Engel’s”, 82, referring to Engels’ letter to Marx of June 6, 1853; see Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, Correspondence 1846-1895: A Selection with Commentary
and Notes (New York: International Publishers, without date [1934?]), 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

To quote Engels again, “it seems that Mohammad’s religious revolution, like ''every'' religious movement, was ''formally a reaction'', an alleged return to the old, the simple”.&lt;ref&gt;Ditiakin, “Marks i Engel’s”, 83 (Engels’ letter to Marx, May 1853; cf. Marx and Engels, Correspondence 1846-1895, 64; emphasis in the original)&lt;/ref&gt; “the movement [of Muhammad] has seemed to me to have the character of a Bedouin reaction against the settled but degenerate fellahin of the towns, who at that time had also become very decadent in their religion, mingling a corrupt nature-cult with corrupt Judaism and Christianity.” The decline referred to by Engels was thus economic and religious.

According to Ditiakin, Engels’ statements led to the apparent contradiction that the uncivilized Bedouins, who were defeated and driven out of their country by foreign invaders, created an “[[Ideology|ideological system]]” that would ultimately rescue Arabia and soon rule over
a huge part of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Ditiakin, “Marks i Engel’s”, 83.&lt;/ref&gt; In Ditiakin's mind, this apparent contradiction can only be solved by the following line of reasoning: The cradle of Islam was characterized by a coexistence of the nomadic lifestyle of the Bedouins and the formerly highly developed trade economy of the “[[fellah|urban fellahs]]”, which was however in decline, but still “potentially” stronger than the Bedouin culture. A series of “revolutionary blows” was necessary to dissolve the contradictions between the two, and to free the trade formation from its restrictions. These blows came in the form of foreign invasions, as Engels had
suggested in 1853: “The expulsion of the [[Habesha people|Abyssinia]]ns took place about forty years before Mohammed and was obviously the first act of the awakening Arabian national consciousness, which was also spurred by Persian invasions from the North, pushing forward almost to Mecca”.&lt;ref&gt;Ditiakin, “Marks i Engel’s”, 83 (Engels to Marx, June 6, 1853).&lt;/ref&gt;

For Ditiakin, Islam had a Bedouin character, and Bedouin lifestyle had a huge impact on the new religion. Due to the course of the Islamic expansion, however, the emergent religion of Islam was soon adapted to the foundations of urban economy. Accordingly, Islam eliminated the relics of the clan-based society and became the ideology of an urban society. The old nomadic and Bedouin cultural heritage of Islam, however, turned out to be strong enough to prevent Islam from becoming dominant in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Ditiakin, “Marks i Engel’s”, 85f.&lt;/ref&gt; Ditiakin came to the conclusion that Muhammad's fight against the Quraysh of Mecca was “a revolution of the dying Bedouin culture against developing trade capital”—seemingly the exact contrary to Reisner's trade capitalism theory.

==Bedouin theory==
Another interpretation of the role of the Bedouins was brought forward by the Kazakh communist and historian Sandzhar D. Asfendiarov (1889–1938).&lt;ref&gt;For his biography see R.V. Suleimenov, “Vidnyi deiatel’ sotsialisticheskogo stroitel’stvav Srednei Azii i Kazakhstane, uchenyi-vostokoved”, in: Sandzhar Dzhafarovich Asfendiarov (Alma-Ata, 1990), 3-26; M. Makhmudov, “Partiino-gosudarstvennaia deiatel’nost’ S.D. Asfendiarova v Turkestane”, in: ibid., 44-60.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1928, during his brief directorate of the Moscow Oriental Institute, Asfendiarov published his first booklet on the “Reasons for the Emergence of Islam”.&lt;ref&gt;S.D. Asfendiarov, Materialy k izucheniiu istorii vostoka. Chast’ pervaia: Prichiny vozniknoveniia islama (Samarkand, 1928).&lt;/ref&gt;

Asfendiarov regarded Islam as the product not of the merchants of Mecca, as Reisner did, but of the Arab nomads. To him, the Islamic expansion was a huge emigration wave of about one million nomads from the [[Hijaz]] and [[Najd]] regions of Arabia to the outside world.&lt;ref&gt;Asfendiarov, Materialy, 43.&lt;/ref&gt; Asfendiarov maintained that Islam emerged as the last huge expansion of Semite tribes from Arabia. However, Asfendiarov insisted that this expansion resulted from changes in the nomadic economy, not from climate change.&lt;ref&gt;Asfendiarov, Materialy, 47-50.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to him, the Arabs were beyond the formation of “primitive patriarchal nomadism”; rather, they possessed a “developed”, modified cattle breeding economy. By the 7th century, Arabia suffered from a scarcity in land for cattle breeding. The Byzantine and Persian empires in the North, and the Persian and Ethiopian interventions in Yemen, resulted in an isolation of Central Arabia, as well as in a heightened competition for the available pastures.&lt;ref&gt;Asfendiarov, Materialy, 15, 27.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to this scarcity and competition, Arab tribes now occupied the oases and towns of the Hijaz, like Mecca and Medina, which had hitherto been inhabited mainly by Jews and other settled populations. The Arabic tribes that conquered these settlements took over the agricultural and merchant activities that had been in place.&lt;ref&gt;Asfendiarov, Materialy, 22ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Some Bedouin tribes, like the Quraysh, therefore turned into trading tribes. Due to the increased mutual raiding and warfare among cattle-breeders, more and more Arab nomads lost their livestock, settled around these settlements as pauperized and dependant clans, and took on agricultural work to make a living.&lt;ref&gt;Asfendiarov, Materialy, 17, 53.&lt;/ref&gt;

For all of these reasons, the tribal economy of 7th-century Arabia constituted more than just a primitive patriarchal society, for the majority of transhumant cattle-breeders was supplemented by Arab traders and Arab agriculturalists (or “semi-agriculturalists”, as Asfendiarov had it,&lt;ref&gt;Asfendiarov, Materialy, 12.&lt;/ref&gt; for they still had connections to the nomadic way of life). Taken together, these three social groups still made up one single economic formation, one that was characterized by a certain amount of economic specialization with all ensuing social contradictions, especially a marked distinction between rich and poor. What they all had in common was their tribal organization, which did not evolve into a community- or neighborhood-based social organization. The tribal organization, according to Asfendiarov, was not simply a “residue” (perezhitok) of the past that was doomed to vanish, but rather a very functional element necessary for survival in all three economic environments.&lt;ref&gt;Asfendiarov, Materialy, 29f.&lt;/ref&gt; He concluded that the Orient was characterized not by a historical sequence of primitive-patriarchal, feudal, and capitalist society, as in the West, but by one tribal formation that combined elements from all three formations. According to Asfendiarov, this tribal formation was retained at least until the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;Asfendiarov, Materialy, 5ff., 51.&lt;/ref&gt;

Islam, in Asfendiarov's mind, was nothing but the event that triggered off the social expansion of the Arab tribes, uniting the tribes to break the isolation of Arabia. It was an “unconscious impulse”, an “almost secondary reason” for the movement of the tribes. Islam should therefore be understood as an economic movement of the tribes.&lt;ref&gt;Asfendiarov, Materialy, 28, 48.&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, Asfendiarov strongly criticized Reisner's view that Islam embodied the interests of the Meccan traders.&lt;ref&gt;Asfendiarov, Materialy, 20, 24, 39-43, 59.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Peasant theory==
A completely new interpretation of the rise of Islam was brought
forward by the economist Mikhail L. Tomara. Tomara's article in the Ateist special issue of 1930, entitled “The
Origin of Islam and Its Class Basis”,&lt;ref&gt;M. Tomara, “Proiskhozhdenie islama i ego klassovoe osnovanie”, in: Ateist, no. 58
(November 1930), 19-47.&lt;/ref&gt; points at the role of peasants
and agriculture in 7th-century Arabia. Tomara listed up a vast
number of witnesses, taken partly from al-Ṭabarī (d. 923), but
mostly from European travellers like Niebuhr, Burton and Palgrave,
and especially from Aloys Sprenger's ''Das Leben und Werk des Mohammed''
(1861–1865), showing that Arabia's agricultural and horticultural
population vastly exceeded its Bedouin population, not to speak of
the merchants.

In Tomara's mind, agriculture was mainly taken up
by impoverished Bedouins; under the general climate change in
Arabia, Bedouins whose pastures dried up would either emigrate or, when the emigration was blocked as was the case before Islam,
dig wells and settle down to pursue agriculture with the help of
artificial irrigation. The continuous transformation of pasture land
into fields led to an intensified struggle between the Bedouins and
the peasant population. Tomara assumed that the agriculturalists
consisted mainly of clients (''mawālī'', sing. ''mawla'') of powerful
clans, manumitted slaves and other dislocated people. Poor agriculturalists
would become dependent on usurers and often lose their
house, land, and cattle, thus being forced to work as hired pastors
(Russ. ''batraki'') for rich neighbors. Tomara thus distinguished three
“classes”: nomads, well-to-do peasants, and impoverished peasants
who lived a semi-transhumant or even transhumant life (obviously,
while herding the Bedouins’ cattle).&lt;ref&gt;Tomara, “Proiskhozhdenie islama”, 19-25.&lt;/ref&gt; Incidentally, he provided no source for his assumption that impoverished peasants sold their labor as pastors.

Tomara further maintained that trade was only slightly developed
in 7th-century Arabia, and therefore Islam cannot be credited to it:
“Islam was born in the trade city of Mecca, but only as an expression
of the dissatisfaction of the poor strata of the city; and it turned
out to be unsuccessful there. Trade capital, as a fierce opponent of
Islam, defeated Islam and drove it out of Mecca”&lt;ref&gt;Tomara, “Proiskhozhdenie islama”, 47; cf. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently,
Islam found a solid class basis in Medina, an exclusively agricultural
town. The Koran's endorsement of charity, so Tomara, the use of
alms to support the poor, to manumit slaves, and to relieve debtors
from their financial burdens, shows clearly that Islam emerged as
the religion of the urban poor. The poor emigrants (muhājirūn) from
Mecca joined the urban poor of Medina and broke the power of
the rich Medinan landowners who had opposed Muhammad at
several occasions. As indicated in Koran 59:7, Muhammad allotted
agricultural lands in and around Medina to his poor supporters as
well as to people who flocked to him from other agricultural communities
in Arabia. The increasing need to reward peasant supporters
led to the expulsion, and later annihilation, of the Jewish clans of Medina, for they held the best arable land in and around the oasis.
By contrast, Muhammad did not invest much energy into the fight
against the Quraysh, for there was no peasant land to gain from
dry Mecca; the few famous battles like Badr (in 624) were mere
skirmishes, and the later battle at Uhud and the Meccan siege of
Medina show that Muhammad was clearly on the defensive against
his hometown. Tomara found support for his “peasant theory” in
the Koran; its ban of interest, in his mind, expressed the interests
of agriculturalists who suffered from exploitation by usurers. Also,
he suggested that the Koranic inheritance laws reflect the ongoing
splitting-up of agricultural land in Medina.&lt;ref&gt;Tomara, “Proiskhozhdenie islama”, 29ff., 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

The nomads, by contrast, did not play an active role in Tomara's
scenario; they were unreliable as warriors,75 and they accepted Islam
only superficially. Also, “if Islam was the religion of the nomadic
cattle-breeders, then Paradise would have been depicted [in the
Koran] as infinite steppes of high grass, similar to the way how
American Indians imagined their reward in the Hereafter as hunting
grounds in prairies with plenty of bisons and other wild animals.”&lt;ref&gt;Tomara, “Proiskhozhdenie islama”, 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

Accordingly, in the War of Apostasy (ridda) after Muhammad's death
the Bedouin tribes tried to reclaim the pasture lands they had lost
to the poor Medinans and to agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;Tomara, “Proiskhozhdenie islama”, 37.&lt;/ref&gt; But this rebellion was
crushed by Abū Bakr, and the nomads found themselves forced to
emigrate. As both the Sassanid and the Byzantine empire were now
in political and economical disarray, the Bedouins found an easy
outlet by emigration to Persia, Syria, and Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;Tomara, “Proiskhozhdenie islama”, 39-45.&lt;/ref&gt; In result, and
somewhat surprisingly, the Islamic expansion under the first caliphs
was mainly undertaken by nomads driven out of their territories by
Islam itself. Thus, in its beginnings Islam was the ideology of the
peasants, and only later, under the Abbasids after 750, did Islam
become “the ideology of trade capital in the form of Mu’tazilism, and the ideology of the feudal classes of Persia in the form of
Shi’ism.”&lt;ref&gt;Tomara, “Proiskhozhdenie islama”, 47.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tomara's interpretation thus does not ignore the role of nomadic
Bedouins and urban traders, and even assigns them meaningful roles
in the emergence and spread of Islam. Their functions, however,
were mainly defined in the negative. Because Tomara
pointed out the crucial role of the poor agriculturalists in and around
the towns, his concept would be regarded by his opponents as a
mere “peasant theory”.

==Klimovich==
Liutsian I. Klimovich (1907–1989), in his first major scholarly article, entitled “On the Origin of
Islam”,&lt;ref&gt;published 1927 in Ateist&lt;/ref&gt; made references to a
considerable number of Western Orientalists (like Dozy, Nöldeke,
Muir, Weil, von Kremer, Lammens, and Sprenger) and largely followed Mikhail Reisner's theory that Islam emerged from Meccan trade
capitalism. The opposition of the poor merchant families was directed
against the rich clans and their pagan cult at the kaaba. This opposition
manifested itself first in the movement of the Arab Hanif
monotheists which was later to develop into Islam. Klimovich maintained
that this movement was originally atheist, progressive and
revolutionary in character; when Muhammad became its figurehead
the movement took on religious traits, yet without losing its progressive
character right away.&lt;ref&gt;L. Klimovich, “K voprosu o proiskhozhdenii islama”, in: Ateist, No. 18, April 1927,
52-63, here: 55ff.&lt;/ref&gt; After the hijra to Medina Muhammad
turned into a dexterous politician for whom Islam was nothing but
a means to gain power. Similarly, the Arab tribes that joined the
movement were only interested in booty, not in religion. After a
series of battles the reactionary merchants of Mecca decided to
embrace the new religion, because they understood that Islam would
provide them with a new instrument for ruling over the Arab tribes.
It is at the hands of these rich merchant families, according to
Klimovich, that Islam finally turned from a revolutionary movement
into an instrument for oppression and spiritual enslavement of the
Muslim masses.&lt;ref&gt;Klimovich, “K voprosu o proiskhozhdenii islama”, 61ff.&lt;/ref&gt; It seems that with his insistence on the “progressive” character of early Islam Klimovich intended to develop a new and specific strategy for anti-Islamic propaganda, one that would pull the carpet from underneath the believers’ feet.
After graduating in 1929 Klimovich returned to his hometown
Kazan, where he was a member of the local branch of the League
of the Militant Godless (Soiuz Voinstvuiushchikh Bezbozhnikov, SVB).&lt;ref&gt;On the SVB see the study of Daniel Peris, Storming the Heavens: The Soviet League of
the Militant Godless (Ithaca; London, 1998), which, however, does not take into consideration
atheist propaganda work among the Muslim populations of the Soviet Union.&lt;/ref&gt;
That same year he published his first two books. In Sotsialisticheskoe
stroitel’stvo na vostoke i religiia,&lt;ref&gt;“The Socialist Construction in the
East and Religion”, 1929&lt;/ref&gt; Klimovich maintained that the Muslim
periphery of the Soviet Union was witnessing an ongoing revival of
Islam. Under the conditions of the New Economic Policy, reformist
mullahs tried to convince the Muslim masses that Islam was perfectly compatible with socialism.

Klimovich warned that this was a deception,
for socialism was based on Marxism, [[materialism]], and the
[[Hegel|dialectical method]], and diametrically opposed to religion and its
[[idealism]]. Atheist propagandists, however, were often helpless in their
discussions with the believers. What Klimovich considered necessary,
therefore, was basic information on Islam for the anti-religious
activist. This was the purpose of his second book of 1929, Soderzhanie
korana (“The Contents of the Koran”).&lt;ref&gt;Liutsian Klimovich, Soderzhanie korana. S predisloviem i pod redaktsiei prof. V. Ditiakina
(Moscow: Ateist, 1929); cf. the preface written by the editor Ditiakin, 5.&lt;/ref&gt; This book was
basically a compilation of quotations from the Koran. Klimovich
explained the book's structure, the Koranic image of God, as well
as its narratives on the creation of the world, Judgment Day, Paradise,
and Hell. Above all, he emphasized internal contradictions in the
Koranic message and the scientific inaccurateness and simplicity
of the scripture.

Klimovich's Koran book still followed Mikhail Reisner's view that
Islam emerged from Meccan merchant capitalism.&lt;ref&gt;Klimovich, Soderzhanie korana, 3 (Ditiakin), 51 (Klimovich). In his preface to Klimovich’s
book, Ditiakin remarked that this view was at least disputed. Ditiakin also openly
criticized Klimovich for certain shortcomings, and maintained that Klimovich’s book was
only a “first attempt” (5).&lt;/ref&gt; The Koran,
according to Klimovich, was an “Arabic law book” which demanded
discipline in the interest of the merchant corporation, whose codex
it represents. Besides trade, a second “way” demanded in the holy
book of Islam is endurance and obedience to God, the Prophet and
his family, as well as to the “people in power”, which, in Klimovich's
mind, clearly reflected the reactionary turn of Islam. The third “way”
of Islam is jihād, the call to fight and kill the unbelievers. As martyrs
would directly go to heaven, Klimovich regarded jihād as “a lottery
in which one cannot lose”.&lt;ref&gt;Klimovich, Soderzhanie korana, 57, 58, 60.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Existence of Muhammad===
In November 1930 Klimovich came up with what he probably believed to be a fatal blow to Islam and at the same time a revolution within Islamic studies. That month he gave a lecture in the Communist Academy (probably in Kazan), asking the provocative question, “Did Muhammad Exist?”&lt;ref&gt;Liutsian Klimovich, “Sushchestvoval li Mokhammed? Diskussiia v Kommunisticheskoi akademii v antireligioznoi sektsii instituta filosofii 12/XI 1930g. po dokladu L.I. Klimovicha”,
in: Voinstvuiushchii ateizm, No. 2-3, (1931), 189-218.&lt;/ref&gt; This lecture amounted to a wholesale refutation of Islamic historiography on the early Muslim community. According to Klimovich, no contemporary sources on Muhammad's life have come down to us; the earliest known reports and biographies of the prophet, like that of Ibn Isḥāq/Ibn Hishām, were written by Muslim authors of the mid-8th and 9th centuries. By that time, however, the Muslim scholars themselves had no reliable information on Muhammad's life at their disposal; all they had was the Koran, and therefore their biographies and the ḥadīth material is nothing but a late illustration and commentary on the Koran.&lt;ref&gt;Klimovich, “Sushchestvoval li Mokhammed?”, 197. Klimovich does not refer to Western authors who questioned the authenticity of ḥadīth.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, by that time the language of the Koran itself was so incomprehensible even to Arabs that the new additional
sources were necessary to make sense of it at all.&lt;ref&gt;Klimovich, “Sushchestvoval li Mokhammed?”, 200 (with reference to a statement by
Vasilii Bartol’d).&lt;/ref&gt; In result, the time gap between Muhammad's alleged lifetime and the first written
sources was so huge that we cannot suppose that any of the information given in these sources is authentic. According to Klimovich,
also references to Muhammad in Christian sources were anything
but convincing.&lt;ref&gt;Klimovich, “Sushchestvoval li Mokhammed?”, 200f.&lt;/ref&gt; Klimovich concluded that nothing is known for
sure about the historical Muhammad, and that it is even likely that
he never existed. Quite consequently, Klimovich assumed that the
Koran was not Muhammad's work but the product of a whole
group of authors.&lt;ref&gt;Klimovich, “Sushchestvoval li Mokhammed?”, 198.&lt;/ref&gt; Muhammad was created by later historians as
a myth, designed to explain the emergence of the Islamic community
out of the Hanif movement. The prophet was an invention to cover
up early Islam's character as a social protest movement.&lt;ref&gt;Klimovich, “Sushchestvoval li Mokhammed?”, 208.&lt;/ref&gt;

===During the Stalinist Era===
During the Stalinist Era and the domination of Feudalism theory, Klimovich understood he had to withdraw from his view that Islam had initially been a progressive social protest movement. The starting point could no longer be the Koran, the Arabic tradition, or the critique of “bourgeois” Orientalism; instead, one had to start with the works of Marx and Engels. In a lecture held at the KUTV in May 1933,&lt;ref&gt;Published later in Revoliutsionnyi Vostok as “Marx and Engels on Islam and the Problem of Its Origin in Soviet Islamic Studies”&lt;/ref&gt; 120 Klimovich basically listed up all quotes by Engels on Islam which Ditiakin had already published in 1927, without, however, giving any credit to Ditiakin. As we have seen, Engels remarked that religion was a “fantastic” reflection on life, that Islam was the “reaction of the Bedouins” as well as the “first act of the awakening Arabian national consciousness”, a “return to the old”. Taking these quotes together, Klimovich concluded that Islam had to be classified as reactionary.

Klimovich now contended that Islam resulted from a process of “feudalization” and centralization of the Arabic tribes, which was reflected in the centralization of the religious cults in the Kaaba. Put in these terms, Islam emerged as the “ideology of feudal lords (Russ. feodalov)”, representing exploitation and inequality.&lt;ref&gt;Klimovich, “Marks i Engel’s ob islame”, 62f.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Feudalism theory==
This theory remained dominant throughout the Stalinist era and afterward because it confirmed the official Soviet doctrine. The other theories were rejected as "Revisionist" and "Trotskyist"
Already in previous years Soviet anti-religious activists in the Muslim peripheries attacked Muslim landowners alongside mullahs, claiming that Islam supported feudal exploitation.&lt;ref&gt;To give an example, anti-religious propaganda in Azerbeijan denounced Islam as “the
ideology of militant trade capitalism” and “a pillar of feudalism” as early as 1928 (''Ba berowski,
Der Feind ist überall'', 559).&lt;/ref&gt; In
the early 1930s, however, Islam itself started to be regarded as a feudal product. At the same time, the tone of the debates became
even more aggressive. One of the earliest contributions to this develop
ment was a review essay written by one Kh. Naumov in 1932,&lt;ref&gt;Kh. Naumov, “Protiv populiarizatsii burzhuaznogo islamovedeniia (K voprosu o
proiskhozhdenii islama)”, in: Revoliutsionnyi Vostok, No. 3-4 (15-16), 1932, 325-339.&lt;/ref&gt; which appeared in ''Revoliutsionnyi Vostok''.

Naumov's review essay attacked
Evgenii Beliaev, who had recently published a textbook with Russian
translations of Western European Orientalists.&lt;ref&gt;Evg. Beliaev (ed.), Proiskhozhdenie islama: Khrestomatiia, part I (Moscow; Leningrad,
1931).&lt;/ref&gt; Naumov attacked Beliaev harshly not only for “popularizing” the
achievements of bourgeois Orientalists but also for presenting the
three economic environments distinctly, and for adding them up
“mechanically”. Instead of being separated, he insisted, “the three
systems were distinct parts of a unified economy of Arabia in those
days, with the trade regions having a dominant role on the basis
of their feudal relations”.&lt;ref&gt;Naumov, “Protiv populiarizatsii burzhuaznogo islamovedeniia”, 327f.&lt;/ref&gt; Naumov
nowhere explained this relationship between trade and feudalism,
nor did he provide any sources.

Naumov quoted Engels to the effect that “all religion (…) is
nothing but the fantastic reflection in men’s minds of those external
forces which control their daily live”.&lt;ref&gt;Frederick Engels, Herr Eugen Dühring’s Revolution in Science (Anti-Dühring), (New
York: International Publishers, 1939), 344.&lt;/ref&gt; This quote alone sufficed
him to maintain that “the Koran is the distorted fantastic expression
of the reality of those times”. Consequently, it is wrong to regard
the Koran as a source for early Islam. Naumov went on to explain
that it is also inacceptable to make a distinction between Muslims
and non-Muslims, as Beliaev had done when he mentioned that the
Muslims of Medina were attacking the caravans of pagan Mecca.
Making a distinction between Muslims and non-Muslims, so Naumov,
means to take over the position of “missionaries” who sort out the
non-believers (as we will see, the accusation that Orientalists become
missionaries, that scholarship serves religion, was becoming a convenient
and widespread instrument of defamation in the 1930s).
Naumov also attacked many other Marxist Orientalists, including
Liutsian Klimovich for his view that Islam was a “social revolution”
of the “progressive elements of Arabic trade capital”.&lt;ref&gt;Naumov, “Protiv populiarizatsii burzhuaznogo islamovedeniia”, 331.&lt;/ref&gt;

Naumov's leveling of Muslims and non-Muslims, his disregard for
religion as a special factor, can probably best be characterized as an
ultra-leftist position. In general, however, his rejection of the importance
of religion and personalities and his deterministic emphasis
on materialism can still be linked to the school of M.N. Pokrovskii.

“The centralization of the
monetary capital in some Arabian cities, above all in Mecca, the
struggle against the ‘colonizers’ [i.e., the Ethiopians and the Persians],
the dissolution of natural (economic) relations, and the process of
class warfare in general pushed the Arabs with iron inevitability
towards the creation of an Arabic state.”&lt;ref&gt;Naumov, “Protiv populiarizatsii burzhuaznogo islamovedeniia”, 329.&lt;/ref&gt;

Klimovich embraced the Feudalism theory wholeheartedly and attacked Navshirvanov&lt;ref&gt;Klimovich, “Marks i Engel’s ob islame”, 64 (Grimme), 66 (Bartol’d, Navshirvanovs),
69 (Müller). Also attacked is P.K. Zhuze, “Iz istorii kommunisticheskogo dvizheniia v
islame”, in: Nauchnoe obozrenie no. 1 (1923), 26-34 (not available to me).&lt;/ref&gt; and Tomara &lt;ref&gt;Klimovich refers specifically to Tomara’s article “Islam i kommunizm”, published by
Ditiakin in his volume of articles entitled Islam (Moscow, 1931), 189-218.&lt;/ref&gt;

Klimovich attacked the “trade capitalism theory” of Reisner with
similar harshness; to be sure, Reisner had died some years before,
but as seen above, his theory had been taken up and modified by
Evgenii Beliaev and others.&lt;ref&gt;Klimovich, “Marks i Engel’s ob islame”, 77. Klimovich also attacked Nikolai Smirnov’s
(1886-1983) Musul’manskoe sektantstvo (Moscow, 1930).&lt;/ref&gt;

The change in the general political atmosphere of the country and
in Islamic studies in particular prompted many authors to readjust
their positions. This produced a weak but unified Soviet theory on
Islam that would henceforth be regarded as dogma. In the following years it became impossible to describe Islam in
any meaningful manner. The surviving participants in the Soviet
discourse on Islam had to subscribe to the dogma that linked Islam
to feudalism. At the same time it was carefully avoided to ascribe
any content to the term “feudal”, or to explain its relationship with
the “trade capitalists”.&lt;ref&gt;Die Welt des Islams, Volume 49, Number 1, 2009 , pp. 1-48(48)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot summary==
[[File:Ideonlogo.jpg|thumb|left|Screenshot of an ''Ideon'' [[eyecatch]]]]

=== Television Series (prior to the ending) ===
''Space Runaway Ideon'' begins in 2300, far enough in the future that mankind has begun colonizing other planets. On the planet Solo in the [[Andromeda Galaxy]], a group of [[Archeology|archaeologists]] had come across the mysterious remains of the Ideon&amp;mdash;three large armored trucks with the ability to combine into a godlike [[mecha]]. They also come across a large spaceship, known as the Solo Ship. For six months, they had diligently restored the machines but failed to get the giant tanks to move.  Suddenly, a humanoid alien civilization known as the Buff Clan comes across Solo.

Karala, the daughter of the Buff Clan's military commander flies down to the planet against orders with her assistant Mayaya to investigate (her commanding officer, Gije, is reluctant with her, due to her standing and the fact that he once was a soldier under her father). She is pursued closely by comrades sent by Gije, but they lose sight of her.  Assuming the "aliens" (Earthling colonists) have attacked Karala, the Buff Clan begins to attack. Cosmo Yuki, the [[afro]]-wearing protagonist of the series, and his friends Kasha Imhof and Deck Afta climb aboard the three tanks, which activate on their own, and, when they initially combine to form the Ideon, fend off the first assault, repelling Gije's men.

This is a short respite, though, as another force is sent down soon after. Bes Jordan, leader of the sparse military force stationed with the colonists orders that the Ideon tanks be armed with missiles, but while that's happening the cities on Solo are obliterated by the Buff Clan soldiers. Gije and his partner Damido, meeting up with the leader of their expedition, Abadidi Gurimade soon launch more attacks on the planet Solo in an attempt to capture the Ideon (which they refer to as the 'Giant God'). The survivors flee inside the Solo Ship and Karala, who was mistaken by Bes as a colonist is let aboard as well. Other civilians who quickly get aboard the Solo Ship include Sheryl Formosa, a linguist studying the civilization on Solo, Sheryl's sister, Lin; Banda Lotta; three children: Piper Lou, Ashura Nobaku and Fard Maraka; mechanic Joliver Ira, pilot Hatari Naburu and Moera Fatima. The pilots Tekuno and Bento soon join Cosmo and Kasha as pilots of the Ideon's 3 parts and Moera soon replaces Bes as another pilot. Karala and Mayaya are soon discovered to be aliens and while Mayaya is shot to death, Bes has taken a liking to Karala and she is allowed to live, although Sheryl and others distrust her. Karala tells everyone of the Legend of Ide, a story of the Buff Clan's savior, who saved them with the power of Ide. The Buff Clan have searched the universe for this legendary existence, which is what powers both the Ideon and the Solo Ship.

The Solo Ship soon flees the planet Solo using its powerful DS Drive engines and after a fight in sub space with the Buff Clan arrive at the Planet Saurus Star. Bes, Cosmo and the others confront Gije in a powerful Dogg Mack Mobile Suit and later in man to man fighting. Abadidi receives orders from above - Karala's elder sister Harulu that they no longer have to worry about harming her and could kill Karala if need be, since she has ashamed the Ajiba family by associating with the humans. The Buff Clan force chases the Solo Ship to the planet Crystal Star where Abadidi heads out himself in a Dogg Mack. His attempts to destroy the Solo Ship with giant winged creatures known as Bajins backfires and it is he who is killed by them. With Abadidi dead and Damido injured Harulu herself heads to the front. Arriving on the planet Ruins Star, Karala tries to make peace with her sister but is humiliated by Harulu's underlings. Things get even worse for her when Banda Lotta, upset by all the harm the Buff Clan has caused tries to kill her but folds under pressure. Karala willing to die impresses everyone on the Solo Ship with her strength.

The Solo Ship arrives at an Earth base where Cosmo meets Camyula, a female officer who reminds him of his mother. She soon dies right in front of him which renews his desire to fight. Damido, now recovered makes one final attempt to destroy the Ideon but is killed as well. The Solo Ship heads to the planet Ajian and when Gije attacks the planet the Ideon uses its powerful Black Hole Cannon, which prevents the Buff Clan's missiles from hitting the planet, but destroys a lot of the planet as well. Gije heads back to the Buff Clan homeworld as the Solo Ship travels to the planet Flag Star. The Solo Ship and Harulu's Dorowa Zan meet in space and the Dorowa is destroyed. Harulu flees in an escape capsule and meets up with Daram Zuba, a former lover and member of the Ome Foundation, which is plotting with Harulu and Karala's father, Doba, to overthrow the Buff Clan Emperor. With Gije with him Daram now becomes the main adversary of the Solo Ship as it goes to the planet Kyaral. There Cosmo meets Kitty Kitten who desires for the Solo Ship to flee since it will bring nothing but more heartbreak to their wartorn planet. Kitty is shot to death soon after by Daram and Cosmo is injured, saved only by a blood transfusion from Karala.

The Solo Ship, still pursued by Daram, approach Earth but find that their fellow Earthlings will not welcome them. Sheryl and Joliver head to the moon to use the Earth Military's powerful Gloria computer and discover that the power of Ide is infinite. The Solo Ship is attacked yet again and the Ideon uses its newest weapon, the Ideon Gun to defend itself. The 3 children sneak aboard the Ideon in their latest battle with the Buff Clan's Barume Baram Mobile Weapon but this becomes an unforeseen benefit as the reaction of the children in danger make the Ideon even more powerful and yet another weapon, the Ideon Sword is revealed. Gije, abandoned by Daram meets Sheryl and sneaks aboard the Solo Ship. Few trust him even after he kills Daram in a battle on Earth. The Earth military completely rejecting them, the Solo Ship flees without a home to go back to.

The Buff Clan continues to send high ranking Buff Clan Officers after the Solo Ship, but all fail. Moera is killed in battle to the distress of everyone, especially medic Rapot. Gije takes his place as one of the Ideon's pilots. The Solo Ship returns to Ajian who now despises them for what happened earlier in the series and their military leader takes hostages, killing Sheryl's sister Lin before he is stopped. The Solo Ship flees to the planet Steckin Star and Gije is killed when the Ideon is heavily damaged. The Ideon continues to get more and more powerful as the battles and deaths escalate and the Ideon chops the entire planet in half as it makes its escape.

=== TV Ending ===
With repeated failure by his military leaders, Doba Ajiba himself heads out on the Buff Clan flagship, the Bairal Jin. Along with him is the Ome Foundation leader, Gindoro. Karala and Joliver suddenly find themselves transported to the Bairal Jin and are caught by Doba and his men. Karala reveals that she is pregnant with the child of an Earthling's (Bes's) to the shock of everyone and they make their escape. The Solo Ship heads there to save them and do as Karala and Joliver survive despite their ship being shot down. Doba Ajiba then declares that he will do whatever it takes to end the life of his own daughter, causing the Ideon's power to invoke. Karala and Joliver continue to head through the halls of the Bairal Jin and hide from the soldiers. They find the Heavy Mobile Mecha hangar and defeat the soldiers there chasing them. Doba orders his soldiers to find out the source of the recent tremors occurring around the Bairal Jin. Suddenly the Solo Ship departs from DS space right in front of the Bairal Jin and rams right into it. The Buff Clan's forces approach the Solo Ship and the Ideon heads out to fight them. Karala and Joliver, putting on spacesuits, realize that the Solo Ship has come to rescue them.

They leave the dock but are still pursued by some soldiers. Cosmo tells the Solo Ship to keep the Ideon Gun since they wouldn't be able to use it here. Bes and Hatari are able to find Karala and Joliver. A strange light glows from Karala's abdomen. Bes heads to one of the Solo Ship's cannons to help Karala. He fires upon the soldiers pursuing her and Joliver. They make their way to a small Buff Clan shuttle. The Ideon uses its 'All Missiles' attack on the enemy. Joliver tells Karala she's gotten stronger. They head out in the shuttle. Bes tells Hatari to pull back the Solo Ship and have the Ideon protect Karala and Joliver. Cosmo brings the Ideon towards their shuttle, but it is blown up by a stray blast seconds before the Ideon reaches it. Cosmo curses the Buff Clan over Karala and Joliver's apparent deaths. Doba and Gindoro are able to hear him. Bes asks Hatari where Lou is. Hatari says the Ideon gauge has returned to normal. Bes says to reverse the thrusters and escape. Doba is upset at his force's lack of success against the enemy. Suddenly a glowing light appears in front of the Ideon. It is Karala and Joliver, unharmed. The Ideon grabs them and heads back towards the Solo Ship. Cosmo tells Bes and Hatari the good news. Joliver tells Karala she's a great woman and that he'd try to be with her if she wasn't with Bes already. The Solo Ship escapes into Null Space.

Doba orders his forces to track down the Solo Ship, even if they have to go to the end of the universe. At that moment, the Ide is invoked. Yet another strange light envelops the Solo Ship. Doba and Karala's encounter was the last chance humanity had, and both sides rejected it. The Ide released its infinite power, using Karala's baby as the trigger, and the Ide wipes out both races. It scatters humanity and the Buff Clan, sending them to the end of universe to be reborn as wise and kindhearted, to use technology more wisely, and never to repeat the same mistakes they did by using technology. The souls of Piper Lou and Karala's baby then travel through space.

===Be Invoked===
Where the TV series ends, the second movie changes events drastically. The Buff Clan is quickly finishing its work on the Ganda Rowa, a powerful warship that might be even more powerful than the Ideon. After Doba Ajiba declares that he will hunt his daughter to the ends of the universe, the Solo Ship flees under pursuit of many Buff Clan troops. Harulu sends out her top fighters, Tororof and Kilarul, in the Zanza Lubu. Sheryl, drunken and mad over Gije's death and armed with the knowledge that the Ide desires to protect children, brings out Piper Lou onto the deck of the ship in order to strengthen the Ideon. The force of the Ideon gun blows her right off the ship to her death, reuniting her with her beloved Gije. Karala saves Piper Lou and the Solo Ship escapes.

On the bridge of the Solo Ship, Karala reveals to everyone else that she's pregnant with a child that Cosmo and the others call a Messiah. Kilarul and Tororof head back to Harulu telling her that Karala and her unborn child are what manifests the Ide. Harulu decides to both prevent its birth and stop the Ide's power from invoking by killing Karala. The Zanza Lubu is destroyed in battle, but the three make their way onto the Solo Ship. Tororof is killed by Banda Lotta, who is killed shortly after by Kilarul. Karala reveals herself and is shot in the face by Harulu, who flees immediately after. It isn't long before the two of them are annihilated by the Ideon Gun.

Meanwhile, meteors strike both the Earth and the Buff Clan Homeworld reducing them to uninhabitable wastelands. Gindoro, afraid of the Ideon, wishing to flee, refuses to listen to Doba and is subsequently killed. Doba, angry with the deaths of his daughters, has the Buff Clan military force continue to attack the Solo Ship as it approaches the Ganda Rowa. In the ensuing battle, Kasha is killed by shrapnel and Buff Clan soldiers make their way to the Solo Ship bridge. Hatari, Rapot, Ashura are killed while Fard was mortally wounded. Bes is shot in the neck only to hang on long enough to fire back at the remaining assailants. Doba doesn't care about sacrificing everyone's lives as long as the Ideon is destroyed, causing his own soldiers to kill him. The Ideon grapples onto the Ganda Rowa, which fires and kills everyone aboard both and destroys the Solo Ship. The Ide is invoked as the Ideon and the Gando Rowa are destroyed by a resulting blast wiping out much of the universe. 

The naked souls of everyone, Buff Clan and Earthlings peaceful at last, ascend through space. Bes and Karala's baby, the 'Messiah', leads everyone to a new planet in the universe that closely resembles Earth.

==Popular response==
Like ''[[Mobile Suit Gundam]]'' before it, the series originally met with rather low ratings and was cancelled after 39 of its scheduled 43 episodes aired. As a result, the producers were forced to insert a short segment at the end of the final episode that ended the series in the middle of the action. Demand for a release of the final unaired episodes followed the show's cancellation, and two movies were produced to end the series.

The two movies, ''The Ideon: A Contact'' and ''The Ideon: Be Invoked'', were produced by both [[Sanrio]] and [[Sunrise (company)|Sunrise]] and released as a double bill by [[Shochiku]] in 1982. ''A Contact'' featured clips from the first 32 episodes of the TV series interspersed with newly animated footage, as well as modified plot points. ''Be Invoked'' featured a modified version of the final episode of the TV series (removing the ending sequence), in addition to those episodes that never aired, finishing off the ''Ideon'' saga once and for all.

==Influence==
The influence of ''Ideon'' on Japanese animation, despite its rough beginnings and infamous ending, has been considerable. At one time it was rated #10 among the greatest anime series as compiled by famous anime magazine ''[[Animage]]'' (counting popularity, influence, and opinion). On the other hand, the series has never been very popular, even among Japanese mecha fans.

''Space Runaway Ideon'' is a predecessor-of-sorts to [[Hideaki Anno]]'s ''[[Neon Genesis Evangelion (TV)|Neon Genesis Evangelion]]'' and deals with many of the same issues. The ''Neon Genesis Evangelion'' series also ends in a similar fashion, with two theatrical releases: the first part (''[[Evangelion: Death and Rebirth|Death]]'') being composed largely of clips from the already-released episodes, and the second part (''[[Evangelion: Death and Rebirth|Rebirth]]''/''[[The End of Evangelion]]'') made up of new animation devolving into apocalyptic territory much like that of ''Be Invoked'', right down to overtones of [[reincarnation|rebirth]].

==The Ideon==
The titular [[mecha]] was designed by Yuichi Higuchi at Studio Submarine. One of the most notable features of Ideon was the power of the robot, which was more powerful than anything else in [[Super Robot]] shows at the time.

The Ideon is portrayed as a very destructive device in terms of raw destructive power. Although it is, at first, a rather humble weapon in comparison to other mecha, brandishing only an array of missiles and a double barreled energy cannon called the Glenn Cannon on its abdomen as well as limited melee and defensive shields, this changes gradually as the series progresses and the protagonists delve further into the Ideons' secrets.

The Ideon's overall performance increases to incredible heights of speed, durability, and power; even its most basic weapons increase their potency dramatically such as the cinematic "All Missiles" attack where all of the Ideon's now Ide-powered missiles are launched simultaneously at great speeds destroying literally fleets of ships in one attack. Without a doubt, Ideon's destructive power reaches godlike status when three distinct weapons are discovered:

*'''Black Hole Cannon''', which as the name implies, creates a miniature black hole capable of massive destruction. This weapon is only used once in episode 18.
*The '''Ideon Sword''', a beam of pure light emitted from each of Ideon's hands. While the beam's destructive power is immense (even cleaving an entire planet in half at one point), its most peculiar quality is its length. While adjustable, the maximum length of the sword is depicted as being quite possibly infinite. It first appeared in episode 29.
*The '''Ideon Gun''' (a.k.a. the Wave Leader Cannon), a massive blue cannon directly powered by the Ideon's Ide energy to produce an enormous white wave of energy (Depicted as a tornado with lightning bolts) which destroys literally anything in its path in a forty five-degree angle, including star ships and planets. This cannon's initial use leaves the crew astonished to the point of since then refraining from using it until it becomes absolutely necessary. It first premiered in episode 28.

==Buff Clan==
The Buff Clan are humanoids native to the planet Buff in the Gido Nebula of the Andromeda Galaxy. Throughout the series they use a variety of war vehicles and robots called '''Heavy Mobile Mecha'''. These forces are listed in order from appearance and all of them are capable of flying.

*'''Gataman Zan''': A tan capital ship, it is the primary attack ship that hounds the Solo Ship throughout the series.
*'''Copela''': Tan saucer-like ships used for aerial combat in atmospheres that are armed with a pair of beam cannons and a pair of machine guns.
*'''Dekka Bau''': Purple aerial fighters armed with missile launchers in their sides, four lasers on their tops, a single warhead on their front, and a machine gun on each wing.
*'''Gil Bau''': A purple variation of copelas armed with a pair of beam guns, electromagnetic cables with hooks, and missiles from the underside.
*'''Giran Dou''': A gray tripod heavy mobile mecha equipped with a particle launch in its "eye" that fires green energy rings and has missile launchers for hands.
*'''Dogu Mack''': A blue tripod heavy mobile mecha equipped with an electric whip for the right arm, a pincer claw for the left arm, a pair of laser cannons on the head, a 4-tube missile launcher in the torso, and a detachable pod. It is one of the only heavy mobile mecha not to be duplicated or mass-produced.
*'''Gram Zan''': A white battleship armed with missiles and uses a space null drive. It only appears in episode 9.
*'''Dorowa Zan''': A forest green capital ship that joins the Gataman Zan. It possesses a null space drive and is armed with scattering beam cannons on its underside and missiles.
*'''Zlow Jick''': Purple star fighters with tiny remote recon planes, machines guns, and can store three attack pods on itself. These pods are armed with a 4-tube missile launcher, a pair of beam guns, can emit tracking devices, and later given electromagnetic hook cables identical to gil baus.
*'''Zig Mack''': Brown bipedal heavy mobile mecha that resemble the Goggs from [[Mobile Suit Gundam]] armed with three particle cannons in the torso, pincer claws that when used are literally referred to as the '"Claw Attack", and later are armed with a particle launcher identical to the Giran Dou.
*'''Gondo Bau''': Green space fighters armed with a pair of 4-tube missile launchers, a pair of beam guns on the underside, and eight electric claw-like anchors that emit electricity.
*'''Sades Zan''': A jade green battleship armed with beam cannons that briefly joins the Gataman Zan and Dorowa Zan for only two episodes.
*'''Rogg Mack''': Green shelled variations of the zig mack armed with missiles from their shell, can emit electricity upon ramming opponents, and can fire yellow lasers from its four "eyes". They are also much faster than other heavy mobile mecha.
*'''Ganga Lubu''': Purple tripod heavy mobile mecha used by mercenaries armed with missiles and beam cannons in the torso and the left arm is a 5-tube missile launcher that can also launch electric cables. The beam cannons are made of Dovian Particles which deteriorate force fields.
*'''Gadakka''': Silver aerial fighters used by mercenaries armed with underside missiles.
*'''Gabro Zan''': A green battleship used by mercenaries armed with missiles.
*'''Dero Zan''': A tan battleship armed with missiles. It only appears in episode 25.
*'''Garowa Zan''': A replacement of the Gabro Zan armed with lasers.
*'''Galbo Jik''': Gray heavy mobile mecha armed with missiles,lasers, two pairs of grapple claws, and a sonic beam called the Gel Beam that destroys brain cells. They also split into three parts.
*'''Barume Baram''': A purple unmanned heavy mobile mecha that could split and crush opponents with a gel zone much like that of Galbo Jiks and is said to have a gel barrier. It was never duplicated or mass-produced.
*'''Adigo''': Green bipedal walkers resembling shelled rogg macks armed with a pair of beam guns, an enhanced particle cannon, missiles from the back, and electric cables. They also proved to be extremely agile.
*'''Abzonol''': A green heavy mobile mecha similar to the galbo jik armed with four cables that drain energy and are protected by an energy field.
*'''Gadomowa Zan''': A green capital ship that chases the Solo Ship once it is forced to leave Earth and is armed with missiles from its underside and a pair of beam cannons on each wing.
*'''Killot Zan''': A white supply ship armed with five beam cannons and missiles and possesses a null space drive.
*'''Gido Mack''': Teal ship-like heavy mobile mecha armed with four grapple claws and missiles along the midsection. They also split in half.

==Links to Gundam==

''Space Runaway Ideon'' shares a number of similarities to Tomino's ''Mobile Suit Gundam'' series. As well as similar initial fates for both series (cancellation followed by films – though ''Ideon'' never became a long-running franchise as ''[[Gundam]]'' did), there are several broad similarities in the make-up of the characters  and some reused plot devices (such as a teenage electronics expert climbing on board a powerful robot when his home colony is attacked by aggressors).

More explicitly, Tomino included several references to his previous work - a [[Haro (character)|Haro]] appears in an exploding Solo colonist fighter in the second episode (as a side note, this same footage is used in episode 18, but the Haro has been painted over); [[Amuro Ray]] makes an appearance in episode 6 as the Solo Ship's crew gather to plan their next move; in episode 7 Karala refers to a nebula named the "Gundam Nebula"; in episode 9, another Haro appears as some dinosaurs explode; in episodes 7, 13 and 19 a Haro can be seen rolling around on a table as the ship shakes, also in episode 13 a meteor in a shape of Haro can be seen for a few seconds; in episode 18 a poster of [[Char Aznable|Char]] is seen on a bedroom wall, a few seconds later as the room explodes a pair of Haro can be seen flying around the room. Near the end of episode 37 a pink and blue Gundam Mobile Suit can be seen hanging out with the Buff Clan fleet.

Tomino's appearance in the series would be near the end of "Be Invoked", appearing in a spacesuit on the Solo Ship's bridge with storyboard illustrations in his hands. Fittingly, Tomino himself is killed in the film.

==DVD releases==
The home video releases of Ideon have all had very limited production runs. The series' first DVD box was overproduced, resulting in many units that did not sell even years after the release, so the second boxset and movie boxset had much fewer units produced. As a result, they sold out quickly and it was not uncommon to see the second boxset alone command a price of over 80,000 yen used on such websites as Yahoo! Japan auctions or amazon.co.jp, or all three boxsets sell for over 120,000 yen (over $1,000 USD), a remarkable feat for 38 episodes and 2 movies. (For reference, the retail price on the 153 episode Dragon Ball boxset sold new for 100,000 yen, $800 USD.)

In 2006 Ideon was re-released on single DVDs, but the singles, like previous Ideon releases, went quickly out of print due to a low production run. A [[Blu-ray]] box set of the TV series was released on February 2, 2013.

On November 8, 2017, [[Hidive]] announced that they will stream the series on their website beginning on November 9, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2017-11-08/hidive-streams-classic-mecha-anime-space-runaway-ideon/.123783|title=HIDIVE Streams Classic Mecha Anime Space Runaway Ideon|publisher=Anime News Network|date=November 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 5, 2018, anime distributor [[Section23 Films#Maiden Japan|Maiden Japan]] announced their license to the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Hodgkins |first1=Crystalyn |title=Maiden Japan Licenses Maria Watches Over Us, Hataraki Man, Basquash!, Yumeiro Pâtissière, Votoms, Ideon, Xabungle, Human Crossing Anime |url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2018-07-05/maiden-japan-licenses-maria-watches-over-us-hataraki-man-basquash-yumeiro-patissiere-votoms-ideon-xabungle-human-crossing-anime/.133826 |website=Anime News Network |accessdate=July 5, 2018 |date=July 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2-disc SD[[Blu-ray Disc|BD]] set was set to be released on December 11, 2018, however, after fan complaints, considering the quality shown on the Hidive stream at the time, Section23 announced that the SDBD set would be cancelled and replaced with a HD Blu-ray set down the line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ressler|first=Karen|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/daily-briefs/2018-10-23/maiden-japan-cancels-sd-space-runaway-ideon-blu-ray-plans-hd-release/.138524|title=Maiden Japan Cancels SD Space Runaway Ideon Blu-ray, Plans HD Release|website=[[Anime News Network]]|accessdate=October 23, 2018|date=October 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 15, 2018, Section23 announced that the HD Blu-ray set will come February 5, 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://shop.sentaifilmworks.com/collections/pre-order/products/space-runaway-ideon-complete-collection|title=Space Runaway Ideon Complete Collection|website=[[Sentai Filmworks]] Shop|accessdate=November 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other media==

===''Super Robot Wars'' video games===

The titular mecha, characters, and other aspects of ''Space Runaway Ideon'' also make appearances in two of the ''[[Super Robot Wars]]'' series of anime mecha crossover video games: ''[[Super Robot Wars F Final]]'' and ''[[3rd Super Robot Wars Alpha]]''.

Reflecting its status in animation, the Ideon is considered one of the most powerful mecha ever featured within the "SRW" games. Ideon has a gauge, known as the "Ide Gauge", which increases as Ideon is attacked. As the Ide Gauge rises, Ideon's general capabilities increase dramatically (including Ideon's "EN" becoming infinite) and the unit unlocks three weapons: Zen-houi (All Directional) Missile, Ideon Sword, and Ideon Gun (the latter two are available in both a "normal" version and a MAP version). The Ideon Gun is particularly powerful; along with an attack power of 9999, enough to destroy most lesser enemies in one hit, the MAP version has a massive blast radius which often almost covers the battlefield. It is one of the most dangerous attacks in the ''Super Robot Wars'' series. However, when the Ide gauge reaches the maximum level, the Ideon becomes uncontrollable and goes berserk, destroying the universe by self-destructing, which means the end of the game. Hence, while absorbing attacks can rise the Ide Gauge and let the player to use those devastating weapons, there is a great risk that the Ideon will be attacked for too many times and go berserk.

Although rather difficult and dangerous to use in ''Super Robot Wars F'', in ''3rd Super Robot Wars Alpha'' the Ideon is possibly quite overpowered due to its massively increased ease of use. The 'berserk' system is also removed.

In ''3rd Super Robot Wars Alpha'', the apocalyptic ending of ''Be Invoked'' is one of three possible endings in the game and is arguably the worst of them all. This ending is triggered during scenario 56, the final ''Ideon'' scenario. If a certain decision is made by the player, the tragic events of the ''Ideon'' finale play out with an unavoidable conclusion. All pilots on your force even state comments of hopelessness as they attack anything when this ending is triggered, to further the feeling of dread upon the horizon. This ending is only available upon the [[New Game Plus|second playthrough]], and while it is something most players should see at least once, it also ends the overall game earlier than usual (The actual game length is 60 levels), and also doesn't count as a finished game, so it is recommended in most cases that this ending be avoided.  The only significant benefit of seeing this ending is getting a glimpse of Messiah, the unborn child of Bes and Karala who in ''Be Invoked'', guided the dead cast towards a dark recreation of the universe controlled by Keisar Ephes who will most certainly enslave all of humanity for all eternity as he successfully corrupts the Messiah.

===Manga===

The Ideon also appears in a non-[[Canon (fiction)|canon]] crossover manga with Gundam, ''Mobile Suit Vs. Giant God: Gigantis' Counterattack'', with story and artwork by Yuichi Hasegawa.  In this story, set in [[Universal Century]] 0090, the Federation sends [[Amuro Ray]] to recruit [[Judau Ashta]] to help deal with a group of Zeon remnants.  While this seems routine, the Zeons have uncovered what they call the "Giant God", namely the Ideon (which is never actually called Gigantis nor Ideon within the story).  While investigating, Judau learns that the Zeons are planning on using Mineva Lao Zabi's Newtype powers to awaken the Giant God and get their revenge.  Unfortunately, it goes out of control and begins attacking anything in sight.  As Judau infiltrates the Giant God, Amuro (along with [[Char Aznable]]) fight to distract it.  As he nears Mineva, the spirit of Karala and her baby appear, explaining that Ideon remade the universe because it hoped that a new type of human - namely, Newtypes - would be the universe's salvation from war.  But since this turned out not to be the case, the Giant God was set to remake the universe again.  Judau also learns that he is the [[reincarnation]] of ''Ideon'' protagonist Cosmo, and violently opposes this plan.  With Amuro's help, he manages to free Mineva and shut Giant God/Ideon down before it can do any more harm.

[[Yoshiyuki Tomino]]'s name comes up in the story, as Amuro explains the myth of Giant God (the events of the Ideon series) to Judau, suggesting that he exists in the Gundam world.

[[File:Malay Regiment operatives 1949.JPG|thumb|Members of the [[Royal Malay Regiment]] during the [[Malayan Emergency]] in 1949, inspecting equipment captured in a raid.]]
A  '''state of emergency''' (also known as a '''state of calamity''' in the [[Philippines]]) is a situation in which a government is empowered to perform actions that it would normally not be permitted. A government can declare such state during a disaster, civil unrest, or [[armed conflict]]. Such declaration alerts citizens to change their normal behavior and orders government agencies to implement emergency plans. ''[[Justitium]]'' is its equivalent in Roman law&amp;mdash;a concept in which the senate could put forward a final decree ([[senatus consultum ultimum]]) that was not subject to dispute.

States of emergency can also be used as a rationale or pretext for suspending rights and freedoms guaranteed under a country's [[constitution]] or [[basic law]]. The procedure for and legality of doing so vary by country.

==Relationship with international law==

Under [[international law]], rights and freedoms may be suspended during a state of emergency; for example, a government can detain persons and hold them without trial. All rights that can be derogated from are listed in the [[ICCPR|International Covenant for Civil and Political Rights]]. Non-derogable rights cannot be suspended.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} D. Prémont, C. Stenersen, I. Oseredczuk, Bruylant, Brussels, ''Droits intangibles et états d'exception''[fr.] 1996, 644p., {{ISBN|2-8027-0766-3}}, Éditions ''Bruylant''&lt;/ref&gt;  Non-derogable rights are listed in Article 4 of the ICCPR, they include [[right to life]], the rights to freedom from [[arbitrary detention|arbitrary deprivation of liberty]], freedom of [[slavery]] and to freedom from [[torture]] and/or [[cruel and unusual punishment|ill-treatment]].&lt;ref&gt;Article 4, International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights&lt;/ref&gt;

Some countries have made it illegal to modify emergency law or the constitution during the emergency; other countries have the freedom to change any legislation or rights based constitutional frameworks at any time that the legislative chooses to do so. Constitutions are contracts between the government and the private individuals of that country. The International Covenant for Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) is an international law document signed by states.  Therefore, the Covenant applies to only those persons acting in an [[official capacity]], not private individuals. However, signatories to the Covenant are expected to integrate it into national legislation. The state of emergency (within the ICCPR framework) must be publicly declared and the Secretary-General of the [[United Nations]] must be contacted immediately, to declare the reason for the emergency, the date on which the emergency is to start, the derogations that may take place, with the timeframe of the emergency and the date in which the emergency is expected to finish. Although this is common protocol stipulated by the ICCPR, this is often not strictly followed; enforcement is better regulated by European Convention of human rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{it}} [https://www.academia.edu/12431137/stato_di_eccezione_ed_ordinamento_democratico {{lang|it|Declaratoria dello stato di emergenza e Consiglio supremo di difesa}} Nuovi studi politici, gennaio-giugno 2005, n. 1/2, p. 107].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use and viewpoints==&lt;!--Linked from 'Giorgio Agamben'--&gt;
Though fairly uncommon in democracies, [[dictatorship|dictatorial]] regimes often declare a state of emergency that is prolonged indefinitely for the life of the regime, or for extended periods of time so that derogations can be used to override human rights of their citizens usually protected by the International Covenant on Civil and political rights.&lt;ref&gt;See Judson, 2012, "[http://otago.ourarchive.ac.nz/handle/10523/2279. Where is R2P grounded in international law]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}".&lt;/ref&gt; In some situations, [[martial law]] is also declared, allowing the [[military]] greater authority to act. In other situations, emergency is not declared and de facto measures taken or decree-law adopted by the government. Ms. [[Nicole Questiaux]] (France) and Mr. Leandro Despouy (Argentina), two consecutive [[United Nations Special Rapporteurs]], have recommended to the international community to adopt the following "principles" to be observed during a state or de facto situation of emergency : Principles of Legality, Proclamation, Notification, Time Limitation, Exceptional Threat, Proportionality, Non-Discrimination, Compatibility, Concordance and Complementarity of the Various Norms of International Law (cf. "Question of Human Rights and State of Emergency", E/CN.4/Sub.2/1997/19, at Chapter II; see also ''[[:fr:état d'exception|état d'exception]]'').

Article 4 to the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] (ICCPR), permits states to [[Derogation|derogate]] from certain rights guaranteed by the ICCPR in "time of public emergency". Any measures derogating from obligations under the Covenant, however, must be to only the extent required by the exigencies of the situation, and must be announced by the State Party to the [[Secretary-General of the United Nations]]. The [[European Convention on Human Rights]]&lt;ref&gt;''[[European Convention on Human Rights]]'', Article 15&lt;/ref&gt; and [[American Convention on Human Rights]]&lt;ref&gt;''[[American Convention on Human Rights]]'', Article 27&lt;/ref&gt; have similar derogatory provisions. No derogation is permitted to the [[ILO Conventions|International Labour Conventions]].

Some [[political theory|political theorists]], such as [[Carl Schmitt]], have argued that the [[Power (philosophy)|power]] to decide the initiation of the state of emergency defines [[sovereignty]] itself. In [[State of Exception (2005)|''State of Exception'' (2005)]], [[Giorgio Agamben]] criticized this idea, arguing that the mechanism of the state of emergency deprives certain people of their [[civil and political rights]], producing his interpretation of ''[[homo sacer]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Agamben|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Abuse===
Sometimes, the state of emergency can be [[abuse]]d by being invoked. An example would be to allow a state to suppress internal opposition without having to respect human rights. An example was the [[1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt|August 1991 attempted coup]] in the [[Soviet Union]] (USSR) where the coup leaders invoked a state of emergency; the failure of the coup led to the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]].

Derogations by states having ratified or acceded to binding international agreements such as the ICCPR, the American and European Conventions on Human Rights and the International Labour Conventions are monitored by independent expert committees, regional Courts and other State Parties.&lt;ref name=BBC /&gt;

==Law in selected countries==

===Argentina===
The Constitution, which has been amended several times, has always allowed for a state of emergency (literally ''estado de sitio'', ''state of siege''), to be declared if the constitution or the authorities it creates are endangered by internal unrest or foreign attack. This provision was much abused during dictatorships, with long-lasting states of siege giving the government a free hand to suppress opposition ({{As of|2010|lc=on}}  state of emergencies had been declared 52 times by democratic and dictatorial governments, starting in 1854 shortly after the constitution came into force&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://derecho.laguia2000.com/derecho-politico/estado-de-sitio |title=State of emergency in Argentina and other Spanish-speaking countries (in Spanish) |publisher=Derecho.laguia2000.com |date=1999-02-22 |accessdate=2011-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;). The [[American Convention on Human Rights]] (Pacto de San José de Costa Rica), adopted in 1969 but ratified by Argentina only in 1984 immediately after the end of the [[National Reorganization Process]], restricts abuse of the state of emergency by requiring any signatory nation declaring such a state to inform the other signatories of its circumstances and duration, and what rights are affected.

===Australia===
State-of-emergency legislation differs in each state of Australia.

In [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], the premier can declare a state of emergency if there is a threat to employment, safety or public order.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} The declaration expires after 30 days, and a resolution of either the upper or lower House of Parliament may revoke it earlier. Under the Public Safety Preservation Act, a declared state of emergency allows the premier to immediately make any desired regulations to secure public order and safety. However, these regulations expire if Parliament does not agree to continue them within 7 days. Also, under the Essential Services Act, the premier (or delegate) may operate or prohibit operation of, as desired, any essential service (e.g., transport, fuel, power, water, gas).

In regards to Emergency Management, regions (usually on a [[local government area]] basis) that have been affected by a [[natural disaster]] are the responsibility of the state, until that state declares a State of Emergency where access to the Federal Emergency Fund becomes available to help respond to and recover from natural disasters. A State of Emergency does not apply to the whole state, but rather [[districts]] or [[shire]]s, where essential services may have been disrupted.

See also, [[Exceptional circumstances]]; a term most commonly used in Australia with regard to emergency relief payments.

===Brazil===
Extreme act that, in Brazil (''Estado de Sítio'' or ''Estado de Exceção'', in Portuguese), can be declared on the following circumstances:
*Serious disturbance with national impact;
*Inefficiency on the Defense State previously decreed;
*[[Declaration of war]];
*Response to foreign armed aggression.

The state of emergency could last for 30 days, being possible to extend it for more days in case of persistence of the reasons of exceptionality.

Only the [[President of Brazil|President]] is able to declare or prorogate this State; after receiving formal authorization from [[Congresso Nacional|National Congress]] and after consultation with the National Security Council or the Council of the Republic.

===Canada===
The [[Politics of Canada|federal government of Canada]] can use the [[Emergencies Act]] to invoke a state of emergency. A national state of emergency automatically expires after 90 days, unless extended by the Governor-in-Council.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/showdoc/cs/E-4.5/bo-ga:l_III-gb:s_35//en#anchorbo-ga:l_III-gb:s_35 |title=Emergencies Act |publisher=Laws.justice.gc.ca |date= |accessdate=2011-03-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110105195914/http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/showdoc/cs/E-4.5/bo-ga%3Al_III-gb%3As_35//en#anchorbo-ga:l_III-gb:s_35 |archivedate=January 5, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are different levels of emergencies: Public Welfare Emergency, Public Order Emergency, International Emergency, and War Emergency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/ShowTdm/cs/E-4.5///en |title=Emergencies Act |publisher=Laws.justice.gc.ca |date= |accessdate=2011-03-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110105200003/http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/ShowTdm/cs/E-4.5///en |archivedate=January 5, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Emergencies Act replaced the [[War Measures Act]] in 1988. The War Measures Act was invoked three times in Canadian history, most controversially during the 1970 [[October Crisis]], and also during [[World War I]] (from 1914 to 1920, against threat of Communism) and [[World War II]] (from 1942 to 1945, against perceived threat from Japanese Canadians following [[Empire of Japan|Imperial Japan's]] [[attack on Pearl Harbor]]).

Under the current Emergency Act a state of emergency can also be declared by provincial, territorial, and municipal governments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/stateofemergency/ |title=State of Emergency FAQ |publisher=Cbc.ca |date=2003-08-07 |accessdate=2011-03-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511111456/http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/stateofemergency/ |archivedate=May 11, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition Canada's federal government and any of its provincial governments can suspend, for five years at a time, [[Charter of Rights and Freedoms|Charter]] rights to fundamental freedoms in section 2, to legal rights in sections 7 through 14, and to equality rights in section 15 by legislation which invokes the notwithstanding clause, section 33, and therefore emergency powers can effectively be created even without using the Emergency Act.

===Denmark===
The police chief in a district can impose a zone in which people can be [[strip search|body searched]] without a specific suspicion. Such an order must be issued in writing, published, and imposed for a limited period. The police law (article 6) regulates this area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.retsinformation.dk/Forms/R0710.aspx?id=1836#K3 |title=The Danish police law&amp;nbsp;— law number 444 of June 9, 2004 |publisher=Retsinformation.dk |date=2004-09-21 |accessdate=2011-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The normal procedure calls for assisting the suspect to a private area and stripping them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://politiken.dk/indland/article472795.ece Politi: De unge klager over racistiske betjente] (The police: Youth complain over racist cops), by Andreas Lindqvist, Politiken, February 18, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

If the police feel that a situation involving a crowd of people can get out of hand, they can order the assembly to be dissolved and "pass the street" in the name of the king. People that after three such warnings are still part of the crowd can then without further warning be subjugated to [[mass arrest]]. All people arrested can then be detained for 24 hours without charging them or taking them for a judge. This is called a [[preventive detention|precluding arrest]].

The emergency was imposed during the [[Six-Day War|1967 Arab-Israeli War]], and reimposed following the [[assassination]] of President [[Anwar Sadat]].

{{Main article|States of emergency in France}}
Three main provisions concern various kind of "state of emergency" in France: Article 16 of the [[Constitution of France|Constitution of 1958]] allows, in time of crisis, "extraordinary powers" to the president. Article 36 of the same constitution regulates "state of siege" (''[[:fr:État de siège (France)|état de siège]]''). Finally, the Act of 3 April 1955 allows the proclamation, by the Council of Ministers, of the "state of emergency" (''[[:fr:État d'urgence en France|état d'urgence]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000000695350 |title=Loi n°55-385 du 3 avril 1955 instituant un état d'urgence et en déclarant l'application en Algérie |language= fr |publisher=Legifrance.gouv.fr |date= |accessdate=2011-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The distinction between article 16 and the 1955 Act concerns mainly the distribution of powers: whereas in article 16, the executive power basically suspend the regular procedures of the Republic, the 1955 Act permits a twelve-day state of emergency, after which a new law extending the emergency must be voted by the Parliament. These dispositions have been used at various times, in 1955, 1958, 1961, 1988, 2005, and 2015.

===Germany===
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Eschede train disaster]] --&gt;
The [[Weimar Republic]] constitution (1919–1933)&lt;ref&gt;Weimar constitution technically remained in effect throughout the Nazi era (1933–1945).&lt;/ref&gt; allowed states of emergency under [[Article 48 (Weimar Constitution)|Article 48]] to deal with rebellions. Article 48 was often invoked during the 14-year life of the Republic, sometimes for no reason other than to allow the government to act when it was unable to obtain a [[parliament]]ary majority.

After the February 27, 1933, [[Reichstag fire]], an attack blamed on the [[communism|communists]], [[Adolf Hitler]] declared a state of emergency using Article 48, and then had President [[Paul von Hindenburg|von Hindenburg]] sign the [[Reichstag Fire Decree]], which suspended the [[Weimar Constitution]] for the whole duration of the [[Third Reich]]: the Weimar Constitution was never actually repealed by [[Nazi Germany]], but "indefinitely suspended". After the prohibition of the [[Communist Party of Germany]] on March 1, 1933,{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} the [[Nazi Party]] was free to vote in the March 23, [[Enabling Act of 1933|1933 Enabling Act]], which enabled Chancellor Adolf Hitler and his cabinet to enact laws without the participation of the Reichstag. These two laws implemented the ''[[Gleichschaltung]]'', the Nazis' institution of [[totalitarianism]].

In the postwar [[Germany|Federal Republic of Germany]] the ''[[German Emergency Acts|Emergency Acts]]'' state that some of the basic constitutional rights of the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|Basic Law]] may be limited in case of a [[State of Defence (Germany)|state of defence]], a state of tension, or an internal state of emergency or disaster (catastrophe). These amendments to the constitution were passed on May 30, 1968, despite fierce opposition by the so-called ''extra-parliamentary opposition'' (see [[German student movement#Emergency Acts|German student movement]] for details).

===Hong Kong===
The [[Standing Committee of the National People's Congress]] can declare a state of emergency and deploy troops from the [[People's Liberation Army Hong Kong Garrison]] under the Law of the People's Republic of China on the garrisoning of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.

The [[Chief Executive of Hong Kong]] along with the [[Executive Council of Hong Kong|Executive Council]] can prohibit public gatherings, issue [[curfew]] orders, prohibit the movement of vessels or aircraft and appoint special constable all under Chapter 245 ("Public Order Ordinance") of [[Hong Kong Law]].

Since 1997, no emergency measures have been enacted. Prior to that date, emergency measures were used for four major incidents:
* [[Hong Kong 1956 riots]] – with involvement of [[British Armed Forces]] and Hong Kong Police
* [[Hong Kong 1966 riots]] – with involvement of British Forces and Hong Kong Police
* [[Hong Kong 1967 Leftist Riots]] – with involvement of British Forces and Hong Kong Police
* [[Hong Kong 1981 riots]] – with involvement of Hong Kong Police

===Hungary===
According to the [[Hungary|Hungarian]] Constitution, the [[National Assembly of Hungary]] can declare state of emergency in case of armed rebellion or natural or industrial disaster. It expires after 30 days, but can be extended. Most civil rights can be suspended, but basic human rights (such as the right to life, the ban of torture, and freedom of religion) cannot.

During state of emergency, the Parliament cannot be disbanded.

===Iceland===
The [[Constitution of Iceland|Icelandic constitution]] provides no mechanism for state of emergency nor martial law.

===India===
{{Main article|State of Emergency in India}}

In India, an external state of emergency was declared two times during wars:
* In 1962 [[Sino-Indian War]]
* In 1971 [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971]]

In 1975, [[Prime Minister of India|Prime Minister]] [[Indira Gandhi]] declared a [[The Emergency (India)|state of internal emergency]] after she was indicted in a corruption scandal and ordered to vacate her seat in the [[Indian Parliament]], allowing herself to rule by [[decree]] until 1977. It all started after [[Raj Narain]], who had been defeated in parliamentary election by Indira Gandhi, lodged cases of election fraud and use of state machinery for election purposes against Gandhi in the [[Allahabad High Court]]. While some serious charges such as bribing voters and election malpractices were dropped, on 12 June 1975, Justice Jagmohanlal Sinha of the [[Allahabad High Court]] found the Prime Minister guilty on the charge of misuse of government machinery for her election campaign, such as using the state police to build a dais, availing the services of a government officer, Yashpal Kapoor (IAS), during the elections before he had resigned from his position, and use of electricity from the state electricity department. The court declared her election null and void and unseated her from her seat in the Lok Sabha. The court also banned her from contesting any election for an additional six years.

Protests led by J.P.Narayan, Raj Narain, Satyendra Narayan Sinha and Morarji Desai flooded the streets of Delhi close to the Parliament building and the Prime Minister's residence, and in response, Mrs Gandhi declared a state of emergency, suspending civil liberties. Political opposition was heavily suppressed during the emergency. The Government used police forces across the country to arrest thousands of protestors and strike leaders. J.P. Narayan, Raj Narain, Morarji Desai, Charan Singh, Jivatram Kripalani, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, L.K. Advani, Satyendra Narayan Sinha and other protest leaders were immediately arrested. Organizations such as the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, along with some opposition political parties were banned. Nearly two years later, confident about her chances of getting re-elected, [[Indira Gandhi]] relaxed the emergency, released dissidents and announced elections.

In the ensuing election, [[Raj Narain]] and his colleagues rode a popular wave of unrest to defeat her and her Government. [[Raj Narain]] won decisively in the Prime Minister's home constituency of Rae Bareli, and for the first time a non-[[Indian National Congress|Congress]] government took office in [[Republic of India]].

===Ireland===
In Ireland declaring a state of "national emergency" involves Article 28.3.3° of the 1937 [[Constitution of Ireland]], which states that:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapterurl=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/cons/en/html#article28_3_3|title=Constitution of Ireland|series=[[Irish Statute Book]]|chapter=Article 28.3.3° |nopp=Y|accessdate=31 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|Nothing in this Constitution [.&lt;!--explained below under 21st Amendment--&gt;..] shall be invoked to invalidate any law [[Enactment of a bill|enacted]] by the [[Oireachtas]] [parliament] which is expressed to be for the purpose of securing the public safety and the preservation of the State in time of war or armed rebellion, or to nullify any act done or purporting to be done in time of war or armed rebellion in pursuance of any such law.}}

In addition, during a "war or armed rebellion", [[military tribunal]]s may try civilians,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapterurl=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/cons/en/html#article38_4_1|title=Constitution of Ireland|series=[[Irish Statute Book]]|chapter=Article 38.4.1° |nopp=Y|accessdate=2 Jan 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Defence Forces (Ireland)|Defence Forces]] are not bound by [[habeas corpus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapterurl=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/cons/en/html#article40_4_5|title=Constitution of Ireland|series=[[Irish Statute Book]]|chapter=Article 40.4.5° |nopp=Y|accessdate=2 Jan 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The  [[First Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland|First Amendment of the Constitution]] of 1939 allows an emergency to be declared during wars in which the state is a [[non-belligerent]], subject to [[resolution (law)|resolution]]s by the houses of the Oireachtas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1939/ca/1/section/1/enacted/en/html#sec1|title=First Amendment of the Constitution Act, 1939., Section 1|work=[[Irish Statute Book]]|accessdate=31 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the [[Second Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland|2nd Amendment]] of 1941, an emergency ends, not automatically when the war does, but only by Oireachtas resolutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1941/ca/2/schedule/enacted/en/html#sched|title=Second Amendment of the Constitution Act, 1941., Schedule|work=[[Irish Statute Book]]|pages=Ref No.22 |nopp=Y|accessdate=31 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The  [[Twenty-first Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland|21st Amendment]] of 2002 prevents the [[Capital punishment in Ireland|reintroduction of capital punishment]] during an emergency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2001/ca/21/schedule/enacted/en/html#sched-partii|title=Twenty-First Amendment of the Constitution Act, 2001, Schedule, Part ii|work=[[Irish Statute Book]]|accessdate=31 March 2017|quote=In Article 28.3.3°, to insert "other than Article 15.5.2°" after "Constitution";}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The first amendment was rushed through the Oireachtas after the outbreak of the [[Second World War]], in which [[Irish neutrality during World War II|the state remained neutral]]. Immediately after, the required resolution was passed, in turn enabling the passage of the [[Emergency Powers Act 1939]] (EPA), which granted the [[government of Ireland|government]] and its ministers sweeping powers to issue [[statutory order]]s termed "Emergency Powers Orders" (EPOs).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail1939090200001|title=Proceedings of 2 September 1939|work=Dáil Éireann debates|pages=Vol.77 cc.1–190|accessdate=31 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1939/act/28/enacted/en/html|title=Emergency Powers Act, 1939|work=[[Irish Statute Book]]|accessdate=31 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; (The period in Ireland was and is referred to as "[[The Emergency (Ireland)|The Emergency]]".)

The 1939 state of emergency was not formally ended until a 1976 resolution, which also declared a new state of emergency in relation to [[the Troubles]] in [[Northern Ireland]] and in particular the recent assassination of the British ambassador to Ireland, [[Christopher Ewart Biggs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail1976083100004|title=National Emergency: Motion|date=31 August 1976|work=Dáil debates|accessdate=31 March 2017}}; {{cite web|url=http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail1976090100004|title=National Emergency: Motion (Resumed).|date=1 September 1976|work=Dáil debates|accessdate=31 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Emergency Powers Act 1976 was then passed to increase the [[Garda Síochána]] powers to arrest, detain, and question those suspected of [[Offences against the State Acts 1939–1998|offences against the state]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1976/act/33/section/2/enacted/en/html#sec2|title=Emergency Powers Act, 1976, Section 2|work=[[Irish Statute Book]]|accessdate=31 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; President [[Cearbhall Ó Dálaigh]] referred the bill under [[Article 26 of the Constitution of Ireland|Article 26 of the Constitution]] to the [[Supreme Court of Ireland|Supreme Court]], which upheld its constitutionality.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.supremecourt.ie/supremecourt/sclibrary3.nsf/%28WebFiles%29/8AE4D75D995AA3FA802575F3002D5D4F/$FILE/Emergency%20Powers_%5B1977%5D%20IR%20159.htm In re Article 26 and the Emergency Powers Bill 1976] Supreme Court&lt;/ref&gt; The referral was condemned by minister [[Paddy Donegan]] as a "thundering disgrace", causing Ó Dálaigh to resign in protest. The 1976 EPA expired after one year, but the state of emergency persisted until 1995, when as part of  the [[Northern Ireland peace process]] it was rescinded as a "confidence building measure" to satisfy [[physical force Irish republicanism|physical force republicans]] after the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army campaign#The ceasefires|Provisional IRA's 1994 ceasefire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail1995020700023|title=Cessation of State of Emergency: Motion.|date=7 February 1995|work=Dáil debates|accessdate=31 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Israel and Palestine===
Israel's [[Defence (Emergency) Regulations|Emergency Defence Regulations]] are older than the state itself, having been passed under the [[British Mandate for Palestine (legal instrument)|British Mandate for Palestine]] in 1945. A repeal was briefly considered in 1967 but cancelled following the [[Six-Day War]]. The regulations allow Israel, through [[Israeli Defense Forces|its military]], to control movements and prosecute suspected terrorists in [[Israeli-occupied territories|occupied territories]], and to censor publications that are deemed prejudicial to national defense.

===Macau===
The [[Standing Committee of the National People's Congress]] can declare a state of emergency and deploy troops from the [[People's Liberation Army Macau Garrison]] under the Article 14 of Macau's Basic Law on the defence of the Macau Special Administrative Region.

The [[Chief Executive of Macau]] can use the [[Macau national security law]] to prohibit public gatherings, issue [[curfew]] orders, prohibit other activities perceived to be a threat against the Region or China.

Since 1999 no emergency measure have been enacted. Prior to 1999 emergency measures have been used for 1 major incident:
* [[12-3 incident]] (1966) – with [[martial law]] invoked and involvement of [[Portuguese Army|Portuguese troops]]

===Malaysia===
{{Main article|Malayan Emergency}}
In [[Malaysia]], if the [[Yang di-Pertuan Agong]] (Monarch) is satisfied that a grave emergency exists whereby the security, or the economic life, or public order in the Federation or any part thereof is threatened, he may issue a Proclamation of Emergency making therein a declaration to that effect.&lt;ref&gt;Clause 1(A), Article 150, Constitution of Malaysia&lt;/ref&gt;

In the history of Malaysia, a state of emergency was declared by the then-colonial government of Britain. The state of emergency lasted from 1948 until 1960 to deal with the [[Malayan Communist Party|communists]] led by [[Chin Peng]].

States of emergency were also declared during the ''[[Indonesia-Malaysia confrontation|Konfrontasi]]'' in 1962, the [[1966 Sarawak constitutional crisis]] and [[1977 Kelantan Emergency]].

When a [[May 13 incident|race riot]] broke out on May 13, 1969, a state of emergency was declared.

On August 11, 2005 a state of emergency was announced for the world's 13th largest [[port]], [[Port Klang]] and the [[district]] of [[Kuala Selangor]] after air pollution there reached dangerous levels (defined as a value greater than 500 on the [[Air Pollution Index]] or API).

Thiery Rommel, the European Commission's envoy to Malaysia, told Reuters by telephone on November 13, 2007 (the last day of his mission) that, "Today, this country still lives under (a state of) emergency."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://in.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idINIndia-30475820071113?pageNumber=1 | work=Reuters | title=Malaysia lives under state of emergency&amp;nbsp;— EU envoy | date=November 13, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although not officially proclaimed as a state of emergency, the Emergency Ordinance and the Internal Security Act had allowed detention for years without trial.

On June 23, 2013 a state of emergency was declared by Prime Minister Najib Abdul Razak for Muar and Ledang, Johor as smoke from land-clearing fires in Indonesia pushed air pollution index to above 750. This is the first time in years that air quality has dipped to hazardous level with conditions worsening in as dry weather persists and fires rage in Sumatra.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thesundaily.my/news/749914 | title=PM declares haze emergency in Muar and Ledang | publisher=theSundaily | date=2013-06-23 | accessdate=2013-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Maldives===
On February 5, 2018, a state of emergency was declared by Maldives's President Abdulla Yameen for 15 days and ordered security forces into the supreme court and arrested a former president Maumoon Abdul Gayoom and the Chief Justice of Honorable Supreme court of Maldives. &lt;ref&gt; {{cite web | url=https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/maldives-chief-justice-abdulla-saeed-arrested-as-president-abdulla-yameen-declares-state-of-emergenc-1809050 | title=Maldives Chief Justice Abdulla Saeed Arrested As President Abdulla Yameen declares state of emergency| publisher=NDTV news | date=2018-02-06 | access-date=2018-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Zealand===
The Civil Defence Emergency Management Act 2002 gives the [[Government of New Zealand|government]] and local [[city council]] the power to issue a state of emergency, either over the entire country or within a specific region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/2002/0033/latest/DLM149789.html |title=Civil Defense Emergency Management Act 2002 |publisher=Legislation.govt.nz |date=2008-10-01 |accessdate=2011-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may suspend ordinary work and essential services if need be. The state of emergency in New Zealand expires on the commencement of the seventh day after the date on which it was declared, unless it is extended. However, the minister of civil defence or local mayor may lift the state of emergency after an initial review of the region's status.

===Nigeria===
In Nigeria, a state of emergency is usually declared in times of great civil unrest. In recent years, it has specifically been implemented in reaction to terrorist attacks on Nigerians by the Islamic jihadist group [[Boko Haram]].

On 14 May 2013, [[Goodluck Jonathan]] declared a state of emergency for the entire northeastern states of [[Borno State|Borno]], [[Yobe]] and [[Adamawa State|Adamawa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/05/14/us-nigeria-emergency-idUSBRE94D0ZH20130514 | work=Reuters | title=Nigeria declares emergency in areas hit by Islamists | date=May 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A more limited state of emergency had been declared on 31 December 2011 in parts of Yobe, Borno, [[Plateau State|Plateau]] and [[Niger State|Niger]] states. This earlier declaration included the temporary shutdown of the international borders in those regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-16373531 | work=BBC News | title=Boko Haram attacks prompt Nigeria state of emergency | date=January 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pakistan===
{{Further information|International reaction to the 2007 Pakistani state of emergency}}
In Pakistan, a state of emergency was declared five times in its history:
* In 1958 by President [[Iskander Mirza]]
* In 1969 by President General [[Yahya Khan]]
* In 1977 by President General [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq]]
* In 1998 by President [[Muhammad Rafiq Tarar]]
* In [[2007 Pakistani state of emergency|2007]] by President General [[Pervez Musharraf]]

The first three were regarded as the imposition of direct martial law.

===Romania===
{{Disputed section|date=June 2015}}
In [[Romania]], there are two types of states of emergency, each designed for a different type of situation.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}
* State of alert (''Stare de alertă'' in [[Romanian language|Romanian]]): Non-military, can be enforced by a prefect. [[Roadblock]]s are enforced. Any utilitarian vehicle or equipment can be temporarily used by the state, without any restriction. Evacuation is not mandatory, unless extreme circumstances apply. Only [[Emergency medical services|EMS]], [[Romanian Police|Police]] and firefighting personnel are required to intervene. This situation can be enforced in case of [[natural disasters]] or [[civil unrest]].
* State of emergency (''stare de urgentă'' in Romanian): Can only be enforced by the [[President of Romania]] with approval from [[Parliament of Romania|Parliament]]. The [[Military of Romania|military]] becomes the upper form of control in the country (under the rule of the president).{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} The civilian population is subject to strict regulations, imposed by the type of emergency.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} All private and public non-crucial activities are suspended.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} [[Essential services]] might be disrupted. This situation can be enforced in case of extreme circumstances, such as a war.
* Special zone of public safety (''Zonă specială de siguranță publică'' in Romanian): Administrative, can be enforced by local police. This implies installation of road check-points and higher numbers in police and [[Romanian riot police|gendarmes/ riot police]] presence, patrolling the area. There is also a ban that restricts the right to travel for people in the area; any vehicle and individual transiting the zone are subject to screening.&lt;ref name=zona&gt;Silviu Molnar, [http://www.naturalgaseurope.com/chevron-shale-security-zone-pungesti-romania Security Zone in Pungesti Heavily Criticized by European Greens], ''Natural Gas Europe'', 19 December 2013, Retrieved 23-12-2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}}[http://adevarul.ro/locale/vaslui/video-comuna-pungesti-declarata-zona-speciala-siguranta-publica-1_52a46389c7b855ff568bb1f6/index.html Comuna Pungești, declarată „zonă specială de siguranță publică], ''Adevărul'', 19 December 2013, Retrieved 23-12-2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The most well-known event in which the state of emergency has been enforced was because of [[1977 Vrancea earthquake]].{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

The last instance in which the ''special zone of public safety'' was enforced was in December 8, 2013-ongoing, in [[Pungești, Vaslui]] following [[2012–13 Romanian protests against shale gas|civil unrest in Pungești]] from [[Chevron Corporation|Chevron]]'s plans to begin exploring shale-gas in the village.&lt;ref&gt;Gabriel Petrescu, [http://www.naturalgaseurope.com/riot-police-special-security-zone-chevron-romania Chevron Moves Forward in Romania Following Establishment of Special Security Zone], ''Natural Gas Europe'', 14 December 2013, Retrieved 23-12-2013&lt;/ref&gt; According to police officials, the special security zone will be maintained as long as there is conflict in the area that poses a threat to Chevron’s operations.&lt;ref name=zona /&gt; This special security zone has faced domestic and international criticism for alleged human-rights abuses.

===South Africa===
{{further information|State of Emergency Act, 1997}}
States of emergency in [[South Africa]] are governed by section 37 of the [[Constitution of South Africa|Constitution]] and by the [[State of Emergency Act, 1997]]. The [[President of South Africa|President]] may declare a state of emergency only when "the life of the nation is threatened by war, invasion, general insurrection, disorder, natural disaster or other public emergency" and if the ordinary laws and government powers are not sufficient to restore peace and order. The declaration is made by [[proclamation]] in the ''[[Government Gazette of South Africa|Government Gazette]]'' and may only apply from the time of publication, not retroactively. It can only continue for 21 days unless the [[National Assembly of South Africa|National Assembly]] grants an extension, which may be for at most three months at a time. The [[High Courts of South Africa|High Courts]] have the power, subject to confirmation by the [[Constitutional Court of South Africa|Constitutional Court]], to determine the validity of the declaration of a state of emergency.&lt;ref name="sa-bor-handbook"&gt;{{cite book |first1=Iain |last1=Currie |first2=Johan |last2=de Waal |title=The Bill of Rights Handbook |edition=5th |year=2005 |location=Cape Town |publisher=Juta &amp; Company Ltd |isbn=9780702159237 |chapter=Chapter Thirty-three: States of Emergency |pages=798–806}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During a state of emergency the President has the power to make emergency regulations "necessary or expedient" to restore peace and order and end the emergency. This power can be delegated to other authorities. Emergency measures can violate the [[Bill of Rights (South Africa)|Bill of Rights]], but only to a limited extent. Some rights are inviolable, including amongst others the rights to life and to human dignity; the prohibition of discrimination on the grounds of race, sex or religion; the prohibition of torture or inhuman punishment; and the right of accused people to a fair trial. Any violation of a constitutional right must be strictly required by the emergency. Emergency measures may not indemnify the government or individuals for illegal actions. They may impose criminal penalties, but not exceeding three years' imprisonment. They may not require military service beyond that required by the ordinary laws governing the defence force. An emergency measure may be disapproved by the National Assembly, in which case it lapses, and no emergency measure may interfere with the elections, powers or sittings of [[Parliament of South Africa|Parliament]] or the [[provincial legislature (South Africa)|provincial legislatures]]. The courts have the power to determine the validity of any emergency measure.

The constitution places strict limits on any [[detention without trial]] during a state of emergency. A friend or family member of the detainee must be informed, and the name and place of detention must be published in the ''Government Gazette''. The detainee must have access to a doctor and a legal representative. He or she must be brought before a court within at most ten days, for the court to determine whether the detention is necessary, and if not released may demand repeated review every ten days. At the court review the detainee must be allowed legal representation and must be allowed to appear in person. The provisions on detention without trial do not apply to [[prisoners of war]] in an international conflict; instead they must be treated in accordance with the [[Geneva Conventions]] and other international law.

===Spain===
In Spain, there are three degrees of state of emergency (''estado de emergencia'' in Spanish): ''alarma'' (alarm or alert), ''excepción'' (exception[al circumstance]) and ''sitio'' (siege). They are named by the [[Spanish Constitution of 1978|constitution]], which limits which rights may be suspended, but regulated by the "[http://noticias.juridicas.com/base_datos/Admin/lo4-1981.html Ley Orgánica 4/1981]" ([[Organic Law (Spain)|Organic Law]]).

On December 4, 2010, the first state of alert was declared following the [[Spanish air traffic controllers strike|air traffic controllers strike]]. It was the first time since the [[Francoist Spain|Francisco Franco's regime]] that a state of emergency was declared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-11918008 | work=BBC | title=Striking Spain air traffic controllers return to work | date=December 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sri Lanka===
In Sri Lanka, the [[President of Sri Lanka|President]] is able to proclaim emergency regulations under the ''Public Security Ordinance'' in the [[Constitution of Sri Lanka|constitution]] in order to preserve public security and public order; suppression of [[mutiny]], [[riot]] or [[civil unrest|civil commotion]]; or maintenance of supplies and services essential to the life of the community. These regulations last for one month unless confirmed otherwise by [[Parliament of Sri Lanka|Parliament]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ihl-databases.icrc.org/ihl-nat/a24d1cf3344e99934125673e00508142/afad7ae740f9b625c12577370039c9e1/$FILE/Public%20Security%20Ordinance.pdf|title=Constitution of Sri Lanka|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Switzerland===
According to Art. 185 of the [[Swiss Federal Constitution]] The [[Swiss Federal Council|Federal Council]] (Bundesrat) can call up in their own competence military personnel of maximum 4000 [[militia]] for three weeks to safeguard inner or outer security (called Federal Intervention or Federal Execution, respectively). A larger number of soldiers or of a longer duration is subject to [[Federal Assembly (Switzerland)|parliamentary]] decision. For deployments within Switzerland the principle of subsidiarity rules: as a first step, unrest has to be overcome with the aid of cantonal police units.

===Syria===
An emergency prevailed in [[Syria]] from 1962 to 2011. Originally predicated on the [[Arab–Israeli conflict|conflict with Israel]], the emergency acted to centralize authority in the presidency and the national security apparatus while silencing public dissent. The emergency was terminated in response to protests that preceded the [[Syrian Civil War]]. Under the 2012 constitution, the president may pass an emergency decree with a 2/3 concurrence of his ministers, provided that he presents it to the legislature for constitutional review.

===Trinidad and Tobago===
A state of emergency was declared in 1970 during the [[Black Power Revolution]] by then Prime Minister [[Eric Williams]]. During the [[Jamaat al Muslimeen coup attempt|attempted state coup]] by the [[Jamaat al Muslimeen]] against the NAR government of the then Prime Minister [[A. N. R. Robinson]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trinidadexpress.com/news/BREAKING-NEWS-State-of-Emergency-declared-128160123 ]{{dead link|date=March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trinidadexpress.com/news/STATE-OF-EMERGENCY-DAY-3-128333238 ]{{dead link|date=March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; a state of emergency was declared during the coup attempt and for a period after the coup.

On August 4, 1995, a state of emergency was declared to remove the [[List of Speakers of the House of Representatives of Trinidad and Tobago|Speaker of the House]] Occah Seepaul by Prime Minister [[Patrick Manning]] during a constitutional crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsday.co.tt/crime_and_court/0,146738.html|title=Trinidad and Tobago's Newsday : newsday.co.tt :|publisher=|accessdate=13 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government had attempted to remove the speaker via a no-confidence motion, which failed. The state of emergency was used to remove the speaker using the emergency powers granted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/08/05/world/world-news-briefs-trinidad-house-speaker-put-under-house-arrest.html|title=World News Briefs; Trinidad House Speaker Put Under House Arrest|date=5 August 1995|work=Reuters|accessdate=13 May 2016|via=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Prime Minister [[Kamla Persad-Bissessar]] announced a state of emergency on 22 August 2011 at 8:00&amp;nbsp;pm in an attempt to crack down on the trafficking of illegal drugs and firearms, in addition to gangs. The decision of the President, [[George Maxwell Richards]], to issue the proclamation for the state of emergency was debated in [[Parliament of Trinidad and Tobago|the country's Parliament]] as required by the Constitution on September 2, 2011 and passed by the required simple majority of the House of Representatives. On September 4 the Parliament extended the state of emergency for a further 3 months. It ended in December 2011.

===Turkey===
{{Main article|Martial law and state of emergency in Turkey}}
Since the foundation of the Republic of [[Turkey]] in 1923 the [[Turkish Armed Forces|military]] conducted three [[coup d'état|''coups d'état'']] and announced [[martial law]]. Martial law between 1978 and 1983 was replaced by a state of emergency that lasted until November 2002.
The latest state of emergency was declared by President Erdogan on 20 July 2016 following a failed coup attempt on 15 July 2016 by a faction of the country's armed forces.

===United Kingdom===
In [[the United Kingdom]], only the [[British Sovereign]], on the advice of the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]] is able to proclaim emergency regulations under the [[Civil Contingencies Act 2004]] in case of any seriously fatal [[threats]] to their human welfare, their human society, and their environment, such as [[warfare]] or [[terrorism]]. These regulations last for seven days unless confirmed otherwise by [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]].
A state of emergency was last invoked in 1974 by Prime Minister [[Edward Heath]] in response to increasing [[industrial action]].

===United States===
{{Further information|Senate Report 93-549|Insurrection Act|National Emergencies Act}}
The [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] explicitly provides some emergency powers:
* Congress may authorize the government to call forth the militia to execute the laws, suppress an insurrection or repel an invasion.
* Congress may authorize the government to suspend consideration of writs of ''[[Habeas corpus in the United States|habeas corpus]]'' "when in cases of rebellion or invasion the public safety may require it."
* [[Felony]] charges may be brought without presentment or [[grand jury]] [[indictment]] in cases arising "in the militia, when in actual service in time of war or public danger."
* A state government may engage in war without Congress's approval if "actually invaded, or in such imminent Danger as will not admit of delay."

Aside from these, many provisions of law exist in various jurisdictions, which take effect only upon an executive declaration of emergency; some 500 federal laws take effect upon a presidential declaration of emergency. The [[National Emergencies Act]] regulates this process at the federal level. It requires the President to specifically identify the provisions activated and to renew the declaration annually so as to prevent an arbitrarily broad or open-ended emergency.
Presidents have occasionally taken action justified as necessary or prudent because of a state of emergency, only to have the action struck down in court as unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Youngstown Sheet &amp; Tube Co. v. Sawyer]]'' (1953)&lt;/ref&gt;

A state [[Governor (United States)|governor]] or local [[mayor]] may declare a state of emergency within his or her [[jurisdiction]]. This is common at the state level in response to natural disasters. The [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] maintains a system of assets, personnel and training to respond to such incidents. For example, on December 10, 2015, [[Washington (state)|Washington]] state Governor [[Jay Inslee]] declared a state of emergency due to flooding and landslides caused by heavy rains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Washington gov. declares weather emergency|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2015/12/10/washington-gov-declares-weather-emergency/77081310/|accessdate=10 December 2015|work=USA Today|date=10 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1977 [[International Emergency Economic Powers Act]] allows the government to freeze assets, limit trade and confiscate property in response to an "unusual and extraordinary threat" to the United States that originates substantially outside of it. As of 2015 more than twenty emergencies under the IEEPA remain active regarding various subjects, the oldest of which was declared in 1979 with regard to the government of [[Iran]]. Another ongoing national emergency, declared after the [[September 11 attacks]], authorizes the president to retain or reactivate military personnel beyond their normal term of service.&lt;ref&gt;US Presidential Proclamation 7463&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
&lt;!--
    Natural disasters happen all the time. While an emergency may be declared as a result, it usually doesn't require mentioning here.

The '''Tahunian''' is variously referred to as an [[archaeological culture]], [[flint]] [[Archaeological industry|industry]] and period  of the [[Palestine (region)|Palestinian]] [[Stone Age]] around [[Wadi Tahuna]] near [[Bethlehem]]. It was discovered and termed by [[Denis Buzy]] during excavations in 1928.&lt;ref&gt;Buzy, Denis., Une Industrie Mesolithique en Palestine, In : Revue biblique, ISSN 0035-0907, vol.37 1 4, pp. 558–578, Planches XXVII-XXXI, 1928.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Moore3"&gt;{{cite book|last=Moore|first=A.M.T.|title=The Neolithic of the Levant, Neolithic Palestinian Tahunian|publisher=Oxford University, Unpublished Ph.D. Thesis|year=1978|pages=Selected Excerpt on the Tahunian Period|url=http://ancientneareast.tripod.com/Tahunian.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the early date and problems with the [[stratigraphy]] of the excavations at Wadi Tahuna, a great deal of debate has been put forward regarding the definition and position of the Tahunian within the sequences of [[Mesolithic]], [[Epipaleolithic]], [[Natufian]], [[Khiamian]], [[Heavy Neolithic]], [[Pre-Pottery Neolithic A]], [[Pre-Pottery Neolithic B]] and [[Neolithic]] and its relation to other Neolithic cultures such as the [[Qaraoun culture]]. In the search for naming conventions for the culture that started the [[Neolithic Revolution]], this has reduced [[Avi Gopher]] to calling it a ''"Tahunian [[Pandora's box]]"'', resulting in offshoots in terminology such as '''Proto-Tahunian'''.&lt;ref name="Gopher1994"&gt;{{cite book|author=Avi Gopher|title=Arrowheads of the neolithic Levant: a seriation analysis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=plSLhDtq-LcC&amp;pg=PA12|accessdate=11 January 2012|date=November 1994|publisher=Eisenbrauns|isbn=978-0-931464-76-8|pages=10–}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is no longer widely used but would appear to be an early [[PPNB]] culture of the [[Levantine corridor]] of around 8800 BC according to the [[ASPRO chronology]].

{{italictitle}}
'''''The Chicago Declaration of Evangelical Social Concern''''' is a document drafted in 1973 by several [[evangelical]] faith leaders, and signed by 53 signatories. Concerned with what they saw as a diversion between Christian faith and a commitment to [[social justice]], the ''Chicago Declaration'' was written as a call to reject [[racism]], [[economic materialism]], [[economic inequality]], [[militarism]], and [[gender role]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Moral Minority: The Evangelical Left in an Age of Conservatism|last=Swartz|first=David|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|year=2013|isbn=0812223063|location=Pennsylvania|pages=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Under the leadership of Ron Sider, The ''Chicago Declaration'' became the founding document for [[Evangelicals for Social Action]], a think-tank which seeks to develop [[Bible|biblical]]  solutions to [[Social issue|social and economic problems]] through incubating programs that operate at the intersection of faith and social justice.

== Description ==

At the first [[Calvin College]] conference on politics that [[Paul B. Henry]] organized in the spring of 1973, several organizers, including [[David O. Moberg|David Moberg]], [[Rufus E. Jones|Rufus Jones]], and Paul Henry, decided to call a weekend workshop over Thanksgiving, 1973&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Evangelicals: Tackling the Gut Issues|last=Heyer|first=Marjorie|date=30 November 1973|work=[[The Christian Century|Christian Century]]|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The committee invited a broad range of evangelical leaders to come and talk about the need for strengthening evangelical social concern. Nearly forty individuals attended: older evangelicals like [[Carl F. H. Henry]], [[Frank E. Gaebelein|Frank Gaebelein]]; younger evangelicals like [[Jim Wallis]], [[John M. Perkins|John Perkins]], Sharon Gallagher, [[Richard Mouw|Rich Mouw]], and [[Ron Sider]]. Perhaps fittingly, they held their meeting at the YMCA on Wabash Avenue in Chicago&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Progressive Evangelicals and the Pursuit of Social Justice|last=Gasaway|first=Brantley|publisher=The University of North Carolina Press|year=2014|isbn=1469617722|location=North Carolina|pages=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The assembled individuals wrote and signed ''The Chicago Declaration of Evangelical Social Concern'', confessing the failure of evangelical Christianity to confront injustice, racism, and [[discrimination against women]], and pledging to do better.

''The Chicago Declaration of Evangelical Social Concern'' became the founding document for [[Evangelicals for Social Action]], which was founded in 1974.

Dick Ostling of [[Time magazine]] wrote that it was probably the first time in the 20th century that forty evangelical leaders spent a whole weekend discussing social action. Writing for the [[Chicago Sun Times]], Roy Larson declared that someday, [[church historian]]s would write that “the most significant church-related event of 1973" at this gathering&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Historic Workshop: Evangelicals Do U-turn, Take on Social Problems|last=Larson|first=Roy|date=1 December 1973|work=Chicago Sun-Times|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

As Christianity Today magazine noted on the 30th anniversary of the declaration, the conference’s stated purpose wouldn't register as surprising today, when evangelicals from all different [[political spectrum|political stripes]] agree that at least some form of social justice is a central tenant of the Christian faith. But "...Thirty years ago, only a frustrated minority—like those at the Chicago meeting—thought so...Three decades ago, a lot of evangelicals would have called this political meddling, if not selling out the gospel&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2003/december/2.40.html|title=Compassionate Evangelicalism|last=Carpenter|first=Joel|date=1 December 2003|work=Christianity Today|access-date=14 February 2018|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;."

'''The Jordan Museum''' is located in Ras Al-Ein district of [[Amman]], Jordan. Built in 2014, the museum is the largest museum in [[Jordan]] and hosts the country's most important archaeological findings.&lt;ref name="ae"/&gt;

The museum presents artifacts from various prehistoric archaeological sites in Jordan, including the 7500 BC [['Ain Ghazal]] statues which are regarded as one of the oldest human statues ever made by human civilization.&lt;ref name="bm"/&gt;

The collections in the museum are arranged in chronological order and also features lecture halls, outdoor exhibitions, a library, a conservation centre and an area for children's activities.&lt;ref name="ae"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenational.ae/arts-culture/scrolling-through-the-millennia-at-the-new-jordan-museum-in-amman|accessdate=2016-06-01|publisher=thenational.ae|work=thenational.ae|date=2014-03-13|title=Scrolling through the millennia at the new Jordan Museum in Amman}}&lt;/ref&gt; The museum was established by a committee headed by [[Queen Rania]], which became the only museum in Jordan to implement modern artifact preserving technologies.&lt;ref name="ad"/&gt;

==Background==
The [[Jordan Archaeological Museum]] was established in 1951 hosting Jordan's most important archaeological findings. However, the old site became too small and the idea of developing a new modern museum emerged in 2005.&lt;ref name="ad"/&gt; A joint committee headed by [[Queen Rania]], became responsible for developing the idea of a new modern museum by international standards. Construction started in 2009 and the museum was officially opened in 2014, spanning over 10,000 square meters.&lt;ref name="ad"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.addustour.com/17738/%D9%85%D8%AA%D8%AD%D9%81+%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A3%D8%B1%D8%AF%D9%86..+%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A5%D8%B1%D8%AB+%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A5%D9%86%D8%B3%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%8A+%D9%88%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AA%D8%B7%D9%88%D8%B1+%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AD%D8%B6%D8%A7%D8%B1%D9%8A+%D8%B9%D8%A8%D8%B1+%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D8%B5%D9%88%D8%B1.html|title=متحف الأردن.. الإرث الإنساني والتطور الحضاري عبر العصور|accessdate=2016-06-01|date=2015-10-19|work=Ad Dustour|language=Arabic|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160611002956/http://www.addustour.com/17738/%D9%85%D8%AA%D8%AD%D9%81+%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A3%D8%B1%D8%AF%D9%86..+%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A5%D8%B1%D8%AB+%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A5%D9%86%D8%B3%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%8A+%D9%88%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AA%D8%B7%D9%88%D8%B1+%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AD%D8%B6%D8%A7%D8%B1%D9%8A+%D8%B9%D8%A8%D8%B1+%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D8%B5%D9%88%D8%B1.html|archivedate=2016-06-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location==
The museum is located in the Ras Al-Ein area near [[downtown Amman]], adjacent to the [[Greater Amman Municipality]] headquarters. The Museum is only a street away from major archaeological sites in Amman such as the [[Roman theater (Amman)|Roman theater]], [[Nymphaeum (Amman)|Nymphaeum]], [[Amman Citadel]] and [[The Hashemite Plaza]].&lt;ref name="ae"/&gt;

{{use dmy dates|date=May 2016}}
The '''unification of [[Romania]] and [[Moldova]]''' ({{lang-ro|Unirea Republicii Moldova cu România}}) is a [[Greater Romania|popular concept]] in the two countries beginning with the late 1980s, during the [[collapse of communism]]. The [[Romanian Revolution]] in 1989 and the [[independence of Moldova]] in 1991 further contributed to the development of a movement for the unification of the two [[Romanian language|Romanian-speaking]] countries. The question of reunification is recurrent in the public sphere of the two countries, often as a speculation, both as a goal and a danger. The idea, while widespread in Romania, is only supported by a minority in Moldova.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}

Individuals who advocate the unification are usually called "unionists" (''unioniști''). Some support it as a peaceful process based on consent in the two countries, others in the name of a "Romanian historical right over [[Bessarabia]]". The supporters of the union refer to the opponents as "[[Moldovenism|Moldovenists]]" (''moldoveniști'') or "[[State (polity)|Statalists]]" (''stataliști'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://adevarul.ro/moldova/politica/igor-dodon-cetatenii-transnistriei-statalisti-nu-cei-romania-1_5a3ae84b5ab6550cb869f643/index.html|title=Igor Dodon: Cetăţenii Transnistriei sunt statalişti, nu ca cei care sunt pentru România|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
{{See also|Greater Romania|History of Moldova|United Principalities|Union of Bessarabia with Romania}}
The [[Moldavia|Principality of Moldavia]] was a vassal state of the [[Ottoman Empire]] and its eastern territories between the Prut and the Dniestr (approximately half of the principality) were annexed by the [[Russian Empire]] in 1812, in accordance with the [[Treaty of Bucharest (1812)|Treaty of Bucharest]]. The Russians referred to this new region as [[Bessarabia]], taking a name that had previously only applied to a southern portion of the region (known also as the "[[Budjak]]") and extending it to cover the entire newly annexed territory. The name derives from the Wallachian Basarab dynasty, who had presided over the southern portion in the Middle Ages. During the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]], a newly formed regional parliament ([[Sfatul Țării]]) declared Bessarabia's autonomy within Russia. In 1918, after the Romanian army entered Bessarabia, the makeshift parliament decided on independence, only to review its position and ultimately decide on a conditional union with Romania. The conditions, including the provisions for autonomy, were ultimately dropped.&lt;ref&gt;Charles King, "The Moldovans: Romania, Russia, and the Politics of Culture", Hoover Press, 2000, pg. 35&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1940, during [[World War II]], Romania agreed to an [[Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina|ultimatum]] and ceded Moldova to the Soviet Union, which organized it into the [[Moldavian SSR]].  In the middle of 1941, Romania joined Hitler's Axis in the invasion of the Soviet Union, recovering Bessarabia and northern Bukovina, as well as occupying the territory to the east of the Dniester it dubbed "Transnistria". By the end of World War II the Soviet Union had reconquered all of the lost territories, reestablishing Soviet authority there. The Soviets strongly promoted the Moldovan ethnic identity, against other opinions that viewed all speakers of the [[Romanian language]] as part of a single ethnic group, taking advantage of the incomplete integration of Bessarabia into the interwar Romania.&lt;ref&gt;King, The Moldovans...; Mackinlay, pg. 135&lt;/ref&gt;

The official Soviet policy also stated that [[Romanian language|Romanian]] and [[Moldovan language|Moldovan]] were two different languages and, to emphasize this distinction, Moldovan had to be written in a new Cyrillic alphabet (the [[Moldovan Cyrillic alphabet]]) based on the reformed Russian Cyrillic, rather than the obsolete Romanian Cyrillic that ceased to be used in the 19th century in the Old Kingdom and 1917 in Bessarabia.&lt;ref&gt;Mackinlay, pg. 140&lt;/ref&gt;

===Revival of nationalism===
In September 1989, with the liberalization in the Soviet Union, the parliament of Moldovan SSR declared Moldovan as the official language, and asserted the existence of a "Moldovan-Romanian linguistic identity".&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://www.iatp.md/ladom/downloads/M3.doc Legea cu privire la funcționarea limbilor vorbite pe teritoriul RSS Moldovenești Nr. 3465-XI din 01.09.89] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060219024839/http://www.iatp.md/ladom/downloads/M3.doc |date=19 February 2006 }} (Law regarding the usage of languages spoken on the territory of the Republic of Moldova), published in Veștile nr.9/217, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 May 1990, after several decades of strict separation, Romania and the Moldovan SSR temporarily lifted border crossing restrictions, and thousands of people [[Bridge of Flowers (event)|crossed]] the [[Prut River]] which marked their common border.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} "Podul de flori peste Prut. Punți de simțire românească", in ''[[România Liberă]]'', 8 May 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

The factors hindering the unification were complex, ranging from the caution of political leaders in Moldova and Romania, the [[war in Transnistria]], and, perhaps more importantly, the mentality of large parts of the population in Moldova (and to some extent in Romania) who were indifferent or opposed to such a project.&lt;ref&gt;"Romania's relations with Moldova are more ambiguous. The instability of Ion Iliescu's pro-Moscow government in Bucharest has made both sides cautious in seeking ties with one another. In August 1990 Romania announced plans to help Moldova develop a national police force, and a month later the two signed a treaty of cooperation. Although each side has disavowed Romanian-Moldovan reunification, groups are lobbying for it in both republics." Martha Brill Olcott, "The Soviet (Dis)Union", in ''[[Foreign Policy]]'', No. 82. (Spring 1991), pp. 130&lt;/ref&gt; In his address to the Romanian parliament, in February 1991, Moldova's first President [[Mircea Snegur]] spoke of a common identity of Moldovans and Romanians, referring to the "Romanians of both sides of the [[Prut River]]".&lt;ref&gt;''Problems, Progress and Prospects in a Post-Soviet Borderland: The Republic of Moldova''. Trevor Waters. "In an address to the Romanian parliament in February 1991 (on the first official visit to Romania by any leader from Soviet Moldova since its annexation), the then President Snegur strongly affirmed the common Moldovan-Romanian identity, noting, 'We have the same history and speak the same language,' and referred to 'Romanians on both sides of the River Prut'. In June 1991 the Romanian parliament vehemently denounced the Soviet annexation of Bessarabia and Northern Bucovina, describing the territories as 'sacred Romanian lands'."&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1991, Snegur talked about Moldova moving toward the reunification with Romania, adding that the Soviet Union is not making great efforts to stop it.&lt;ref&gt;"Moldavians seek to unite with Romania", in ''[[The Independent]]'', 4 June 1991, page 12&lt;/ref&gt;

While many Moldovan intellectuals supported the union and wanted a "reunion with the Romanian motherland",&lt;ref name="king345"&gt;King, p.345&lt;/ref&gt; there was little popular support for it, with more than 70% of the Moldovans opposing it, according to a 1992 poll. At the same time, [[Transnistria]], the eastern part of Moldova, inhabited by a Slavic (mainly Russian and Ukrainian) majority, used the putative danger of unification with Romania as a pretext for its own aspirations for independence.&lt;ref name="dunlop"&gt;According to recent polls, 70 percent of Moldovans reject unification with Romania as "undesirable", while only 7–10 percent support it as necessary (''Daily Report'', 30 December 1992, p. 3) John B. Dunlop, "Will a Large-Scale Migration of Russians to the Russian Republic Take Place over the Current Decade?", in ''International Migration Review'', Vol. 27, No. 3. (Autumn 1993), pp. 605–629.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political ties and unionism===
Following the declaration of independence on 27 August 1991, the Romanian flag [[Defacement (flag)|defaced]] with the Moldovan coat of arms and the Romanian anthem "''[[Deșteaptă-te, române!]]''" became the symbols of the new independent Moldova.&lt;ref&gt;Mackinlay, pg. 139&lt;/ref&gt; Following the growing tension between the pro-union governing [[Moldovan Popular Front]] and president Snegur, in particular over unification,&lt;ref&gt;George Berkin, "Secession blues", in ''[[National Review]]'', 9 September  1991&lt;/ref&gt; the president moved closer to the Moldovanist group of Agrarians, and appointed their candidate [[Andrei Sangheli]] as prime minister. As a result, and especially after the victory of Agrarians in the 1994 elections, Moldova began distancing itself from Romania. The state flag was slightly modified, and the anthem changed to "''[[Limba noastră]]''". The [[Moldovan referendum, 1994|Moldovan referendum of 1994]] for an independent Moldova was seen by many public figures to be aimed at implicitly excluding a union with Romania. Furthermore, the [[Constitution of Moldova|constitution adopted in 1994]] by the new Parliament dominated by Moldovanist Agrarians and Socialists called the official language "Moldovan", as opposed to the earlier Declaration of independence that called it "Romanian". The attempt by Moldovan president Mircea Snegur in 1996 to change the name of the official language to "Romanian" was dismissed by the Moldovan Parliament as "promoting Romanian expansionism".

A "Concept on National Policy" was adopted in 2003 by the Communist dominated Parliament, stating that Moldovans and Romanians are different peoples, and that the latter are an ethnic minority in Moldova.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://www.parlament.md/download/laws/ro/546-XV-19.12.2003.doc "Concepția politicii naționale a Republicii Moldova"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090225062624/http://www.parlament.md/download/laws/ro/546-XV-19.12.2003.doc |date=25 February 2009 }} at the [[Moldovan Parliament]] website&lt;/ref&gt;

Before 2005, only the [[Christian-Democratic People's Party (Moldova)|Christian-Democratic People's Party]], one of the political heirs of the [[Moldovan Popular Front]], actively supported unification. However, the stance of the Christian-Democrats changed significantly after they started collaborating closely with the ruling [[Party of Communists of the Republic of Moldova|Moldovan Communists]]. During the elections of April 2009, the alliance of [[National Liberal Party (Moldova)|National Liberal Party]] (''Partidul Naţional Liberal'') and the [[European Action Movement]] (''Mișcarea Acțiunea Europeană'') ran on a common platform of a loose union with [[Romania]], but accumulated only around 1% of the votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.e-democracy.md/elections/parliamentary/2009/results/ |title=Rezultatele alegerilor parlamentare din 5 aprilie 2009 / Alegeri 2009 |website=E-democracy.md |date= |accessdate=2016-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political commentary==
In 2004 and later, the Romanian newspaper ''[[Ziua]]'' published a series of articles and interviews with [[Stanislav Belkovsky]], an influential Russian political commentator, who proposed a plan of a unification of Romania and Moldova excluding Transnistria. Speculations followed whether his plan is backed by higher circles in the Kremlin, but they were never confirmed. Nevertheless, several journalists and scholars dismissed the plan as a diversion, also pointing out several ambiguities, such as the status of the city of [[Bender, Moldova|Bender]] situated on the right bank of Dniester but under [[Transnistria]]n control, and, more importantly, the unlikelihood of Moldova's acquiescence to such a plan.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

In January 2006, the Romanian president [[Traian Băsescu]] declared that he strongly supported the Moldovan bid for joining the [[European Union]] and that "the ''minimal policy'' of Romania is for the unification of the Romanian nation to take place within the EU". The phrase ''"minimal policy"'' led to questions whether there is also a ''maximal policy''.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} In July of the same year, Băsescu claimed to have  made a proposal to the Moldovan president [[Vladimir Voronin]] that "Moldova join the EU together with Romania in 2007" and that the alleged offer was rejected. Băsescu also added that Romania would respect this decision and would help Moldova to join EU on its own.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://www.evz.ro/article.php?artid=264063 "Băsescu și-a dezvăluit planul unionist secret"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060705045809/http://www.evz.ro/article.php?artid=264063 |date=5 July 2006 }}, in ''[[Evenimentul Zilei]]'', 3 July 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2006 the Romanian newspaper ''[[Cotidianul]]'' estimated the cost of a union with Moldova at €30–35 billion,&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}}[http://www.cotidianul.ro/basarabia_costa_bani_grei-16193.html "Basarabia costă bani grei"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090812053746/http://www.cotidianul.ro/basarabia_costa_bani_grei-16193.html |date=12 August 2009 }} (''Bessarabia costs a lot''), in ''[[Cotidianul]]''&lt;/ref&gt; and attracted criticism from the Romanian newspaper ''[[Ziua]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ziua.ro/display.php?id%3D208578%26data%3D2006-10-05 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=3 November 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080121235321/http://www.ziua.ro/display.php?id=208578&amp;data=2006-10-05 |archivedate=21 January 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as ''Timpul''&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://www.timpul.md/Article.asp?idIssue=400&amp;idRubric=4314&amp;idArticle=10405 ''De ce Germania a numărat nemții, și nu banii din buzunarele lor?''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070810115618/http://www.timpul.md/Article.asp?idIssue=400&amp;idRubric=4314&amp;idArticle=10405 |date=10 August 2007 }} ("Why Did Germany Count The Germans, And Not Their Money?") – Timpul.md&lt;/ref&gt; for exaggerating the costs and disregarding other dimensions of a possible union.

After the [[Moldovan parliamentary election, April 2009|Moldovan parliamentary election of April 2009]], the [[2009 Moldova civil unrest]], the [[Moldovan parliamentary election, July 2009|Moldovan parliamentary election of July 2009]] and the creation of the governing [[Alliance for European Integration]], a new wave of speculations about the union followed. The Party of Communists, now in opposition, claimed "the unionists came to power."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stireazilei.md/c-0-3043 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=28 February 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100314072850/http://stireazilei.md/c-0-3043 |archivedate=14 March 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a November 2009 interview, political commentator [[Stanislav Belkovsky]] declared that the April 2009 marked the beginning of the process of Moldova's return to Romania.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Natalia Morari |url=http://www.europalibera.org/content/article/1889738.html |title="Aprilie 2009 - începutul procesului de revenire a Moldovei în componenţa României" |website=Europalibera.org |date=2009-11-28 |accessdate=2016-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Traian Băsescu]] made a state visit to Moldova{{when|date=November 2013}} along with a number of ministers to announce several projects that would intensify ties between the two countries, and the offer of 100 million euro grant for infrastructure projects. Băsescu called Moldova his "soul project".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Doina Anghel |url=http://www.zf.ro/politica/relatiile-spinoase-dintre-romania-si-moldova-pansate-cu-100-mil-euro-5451165/ |title=Relatiile spinoase dintre Romania si Moldova, pansate cu 100 mil. euro &amp;#124; Ziarul Financiar |website=Zf.ro |date=2010-01-28 |accessdate=2016-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Private Romanian investments are also expected to increase significantly, with the opening of a Moldovan-Romanian business and investment office,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.financiarul.ro/2010/02/04/moldovan-romanian-business-and-investment-office-to-open-in-chisinau/ |title=Moldovan-Romanian business and investment office to open in Chisinau &amp;#124; FINANCIARUL - informatii utile din Business, Eco-Agricultura, Stiinta, Educatie si Viata sanatoasa |website=Financiarul.ro |date= |accessdate=2016-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the takeover of the online news portal Unimedia by Romanian group Realitatea-Cațavencu group, owned by businessman [[Sorin Ovidiu Vântu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://www.realitatea.net/unimedia-si-publika-tv-isi-unesc-eforturile-pentru-dezvoltarea-mass-media-din-republica-moldova_691185.html ''UNIMEDIA și PUBLIKA TV își unesc eforturile pentru dezvoltarea mass-media din Republica Moldova'']), Realitatea TV, 9 December 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2010, [[Mircea Druc]], the former prime minister of Moldova between 1990 and 1991, declared that the unification of Romania and the Republic of Moldova is inevitable.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://www.stiri.romanism.net/?p=3225&amp;cpage=1 ''Mircea Druc este optimist și anunță unirea “inevitabilă” a României cu Basarabia''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203052359/http://www.stiri.romanism.net/?p=3225&amp;cpage=1 |date=3 December 2013 }}, Știri din Basarabia, 15 January 2010&lt;/ref&gt; However, acting President [[Mihai Ghimpu]] denied in an interview with the Russian language newspaper ''[[Komsomolskaya Pravda]] v Moldove'' that such a move will be taken, stating that a union is not included in the program of the governing coalition.&lt;ref&gt;{{ru icon}} [http://www.kp.ru/daily/24443/608448/ И.о. президента Михай Гимпу: «Никогда не будет объединения с Румынией!»], 17 February 2010&lt;/ref&gt; On another occasion he declared that if the people wanted unification, neither he, nor anyone else could stop them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.europalibera.org/content/article/1970942.html "Interview with Mihai Ghimpu – Radio Free Europe"], [[Radio Free Europe]], 1 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt; He admitted on several occasions to personally share unionist views.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://politicom.moldova.org/news/interviul-timpul-cu-mihai-ghimpu-203629-rom.html "Interview with Mihai Ghimpu – Timpul"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100111043821/http://politicom.moldova.org/news/interviul-timpul-cu-mihai-ghimpu-203629-rom.html |date=11 January 2010 }}, 29 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt; However, in August 2010 he declared that the proposition of an "inter-state union" between Romania and Moldova was "a very stupid" idea.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://unimedia.md/?mod=news&amp;id=22754 Ghimpu: Uniunea interstatală R.

On 27 November 2013, a day before participation in the Eastern Partnership Summit in [[Vilnius]], Romanian President [[Traian Băsescu]] was invited to an interview at the national TV station, [[Romanian Television|TVR]]. There he said that the third priority for Romania, after joining NATO and the EU, must be the union with Moldova.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://stiri.tvr.ro/traian-basescu-la-tvr--urmatorul-proiect-pentru-romania-trebuie-sa-fie-vrem-sa-ne-intregim-tara-_37653.html |title=Traian Băsescu la TVR: Următorul proiect pentru România trebuie să fie "Vrem să ne întregim țara!" |newspaper=Știrile TVR |date=27 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; "I'm convinced that if in Moldova will be an unionist current, Romania will say 'yes' without hesitation", stated the Head of State.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.realitatea.net/basescu-despre-relatia-cu-republica-moldova-urmatorul-nostru-obiectiv-vrem-sa-ne-intregim-ara_1326734.html |title=Băsescu, despre relația cu Republica Moldova: Următorul nostru obiectiv, vrem să ne întregim țara |newspaper=Realitatea.net |date=27 November 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131128161625/http://www.realitatea.net/basescu-despre-relatia-cu-republica-moldova-urmatorul-nostru-obiectiv-vrem-sa-ne-intregim-ara_1326734.html |archivedate=28 November 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In present, Romania supports the full integration of Moldova into the EU.

===Dual citizenship for Moldovan citizens===
A poll conducted by IPP Chișinău in November 2007 shows that 33.6% of the Moldovan population is interested in holding Romanian citizenship, while 58.8% is not interested. The main reason of those interested is: feeling Romanian (31.9%), the possibility of traveling to Romania (48.9%), and the possibility of traveling and/or working in the EU (17.2%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= |url=http://www.ipp.md/libview.php?l=en&amp;idc=156&amp;id=457 |title=Barometer of Public Opinion / Institute for Public Policy |website=Ipp.md |date=2007-11-30 |accessdate=2016-04-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141103113859/http://www.ipp.md/libview.php?l=en&amp;id=457&amp;idc=156 |archivedate=3 November 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1991 and 2009, some 140,000 Moldovan citizens obtained Romanian citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.interlic.md/2009-08-27/cetatzenia-rom-na-pentru-basarabeni-redob-ndire-sau-recunoashtere-11649.html?highlight=cetatenie |title=Cetăţenia română pentru basarabeni: Redobândire sau recunoaştere? |website=Interlic.md |date=2009-08-27 |accessdate=2016-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.voceabasarabiei.net/index.php/stiri/social/6766-cetatenia-romana-acordata-mai-repede- |title=Archived copy |accessdate=8 April 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724122826/http://www.voceabasarabiei.net/index.php/stiri/social/6766-cetatenia-romana-acordata-mai-repede- |archivedate=24 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to some estimates, as many as 1 million Moldovan citizens requested Romanian citizenship by 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.evz.ro/detalii/stiri/aproape-un-milion-de-moldoveni-bat-la-portile-romaniei-847510.html |title=Aproape un milion de moldoveni bat la porţile României |website=Evz.ro |date=2015-10-20 |accessdate=2016-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, the Romanian government created the National Authority for Citizenship to process the large number of applications for Romanian citizenship coming especially from Moldovan citizens.

The number of persons is estimated to be around 400,000, with a potential of 150,000 more persons if all outstanding applications are successful.&lt;ref name="soros.ro"/&gt;

In April 2011, a coalition of NGOs from Romania and Moldova created the civic platform "Acțiunea 2012" (English: Action 2012), whose aim is to "raise awareness of the necessity of the unification between Romania and the Republic of Moldova". Year 2012 was chosen as a reference to the bicentennial commemoration of the 1812 division of historical [[Moldavia]], when the [[Russian Empire]] annexed what would later be called [[Bessarabia]]. The proponents see the unification as a reversal of this historical division, a reversal inspired by the rather short-lived [[Union of Bessarabia with Romania]] (1918–1940) disrupted by the [[Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina|Soviet occupation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.actiunea2012.ro|title=Actiunea Homepage|website=Actiunea2012.ro|accessdate=2016-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hotnews.ro/stiri-cultura-8510245-webrelease-lansat-platforma-civica-actiunea-2012-sustine-uunirea-republicii-moldova-romania.htm|title=webRelease: S-a lansat platforma civică ACȚIUNEA 2012 ce susține unirea Republicii Moldova cu România|work=HotNewsRo|accessdate=25 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publika.md/unirea-romaniei-cu-moldova--sustinuta-de-platforma-civica-actiunea-2012_294811.html|title=Unirea României cu Moldova, susținută de "Platforma Civică Acțiunea 2012"|date=25 February 2015|work=PUBLIKA.MD|accessdate=25 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvr.ro/articol.php?id%3D102788 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=9 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110515125737/http://www.tvr.ro/articol.php?id=102788 |archivedate=15 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact of a unification scenario==
The [[Moldova|Republic of Moldova]] would bring to Romania an addition of 3.0 million inhabitants and an increase in [[Gross Domestic Product]] (GDP) of almost six billion euros (2.8% of Romania's GDP). However, GDP per capita would fall to €9,650. The current Romanian GDP per capita is estimated at €10,859, while the Moldovan GDP per capita stands at €1,725.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://adevarul.ro/economie/stiri-economice/moldova-1_5298cb16c7b855ff56548ac1/index.html|title=ANALIZĂ Unirea economică a Republicii Moldova cu România: ce ar avea de câștigat cele două țări de pe malurile Prutului|work=adevarul.ro|accessdate=25 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Open borders for business would create a very enticing opportunity for Romanian investors, that to move the place of production from the right (Romania) to the left side of Prut (Moldova), the costs being lower in almost all respects. Until now, such "movements" were made only by multinationals, of which the best example is [[Coca-Cola]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}}

If Moldova decided to unite with Romania, [[Gagauzia]], a "national-territorial autonomous unit" of Moldova with three official languages: Romanian, Gagauz, and Russian, would have the right of self-determination. This is further complicated by the fact that while the autonomy of Gagauzia is guaranteed by the Moldovan constitution and regulated by the 1994 Gagauz Autonomy Act, the laws of Romania do not permit ethnic-based territorial autonomy and any other official language than Romanian, even regionally, fearing Hungarian separatism (minority languages may be "recognised" in some areas, having limited use in official affairs). In such a situation, the Gagauz area would most likely secede from Moldova and an independent, sovereign, but Russian-friendly Gagauz state would be formed.

==History==

===Precursors===

[[File:Francisco Gomes de Matos(ed).jpg|150px|thumb|right|Francisco Gomes de Matos]]

Although the 1948 [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (UDHR) has language as one of its categories for equal rights, it does not explicitly list and elaborate on linguistic rights.&lt;ref name="Languages of Israel"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Languages of Israel: Policy, Ideology and Practice|year=1999|publisher=Multilingual Matters|location=United Kingdom|pages=52|url=https://books.google.com.sg/books?id=Xej-BQK9YEcC&amp;pg=PA52&amp;lpg=PA52&amp;dq=impacts+universal+declaration+of+linguistic+rights&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=vkGb0koIPh&amp;sig=rjqTbxbl35KdVCc4fJEkT-7wML4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=1JpVT5SwBcPnrAfNtvCNBw&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwADgK#v=onepage&amp;q=universal%20declaration%20of%20linguistic%20rights&amp;f=false|author1=Spolsky, B.  |author2=Shohamy, E. G. |lastauthoramp=yes |accessdate=9 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even with declarations and rules on protecting specific languages and their rights, there was no binding document at that time that referred to all the languages or to world linguistic rights.&lt;ref name="FCUDLR Bulletin"&gt;{{cite web|title=ENLLAÇ|url=http://www.linguistic-declaration.org/but-gb.htm|publisher=Linguistic Declaration.org|accessdate=10 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, there have been attempts to fill this gap by expanding on the importance of linguistic rights in the global scene.

In addition, the Universal Declaration of Linguistic Rights (UDLR) holds regards to several policies that motivated the respect of linguistic rights. Some of the documents include:
* [[Declaration on the Rights of Persons Belonging to National or Ethnic, Religious and Linguistic Minorities|Declaration on the Rights of Persons belonging to National, Ethnic, Religious and Linguistic Minorities]]
* [[European Convention on Human Rights]]
* [[European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages]]
* [[Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities]]
* [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]]
* Universal Declaration of the Collective Rights of Peoples

The idea of a Declaration was first proposed in 1984, where a Brazilian by the name of Francisco Gomes de Matos introduced to the International Federation of Modern Language Teachers (FIPLV), a plea for a Universal Declaration of Linguistic Rights.&lt;ref name="Plea for UDLR"&gt;{{cite web|title=Two Typologies of Linguistic Rights|url=http://www.humiliationstudies.org/documents/MatosTwoTypologiesofLinguisticRights.pdf|publisher=Human Dignity and Humiliation Studies|accessdate=10 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He listed some of the principal linguistic rights, together with their educational implications.

One of the most significant motivations stemmed from the 12th Seminar of the International Association for the Development of Intercultural Communication of 1987, held in [[Recife]], [[Brazil]], which also recommended the introduction of a declaration for linguistic rights. The Seminar then adopted a preliminary declaration that indexed some fundamental types of linguistic rights.&lt;ref name="UDLR Book" /&gt;

===Drafting===

The main objective of penning a Declaration was to define equality in linguistic rights, regardless of differences in political or territorial statuses. It serves to promote international commitment in respecting the rights of linguistic groups, especially those of historicity, as well as individuals who do not reside within their native communities.&lt;ref name="WACC"&gt;{{cite web|title=Universal Declaration of Linguistic Rights|url=http://waccglobal.org/en/19994-language-and-the-right-to-communicate/806-Universal-Declaration-of-Linguistic-Rights.html|publisher=The World Association for Christian Communication (WACC)|accessdate=10 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As such, the UDLR does not distinguish among official, non-official, majority, local, regional, and minority languages. There was much complexity tied to the drafting process because it was not easy to come up with equal measures, definitions and reasons, especially since it required an international consensus. For instance, one of the most common problems lie in clarifying concepts and their terminologies.&lt;ref name="Languages of Israel" /&gt; Subsequently, follow-up meetings and feedback sessions were held in [[Paris]], [[Portugal]] and [[Frankfurt]].

In 1990, the FIPLV drafted a working document. On August 1991, the FIPLV organised a workshop in [[Pécs]], [[Hungary]]. It was there that they managed to consolidate an agenda on fundamental principles for a UDLR. The Declaration was also discussed in December 1993, during a session of the Translations and Linguistic Rights Commission of the [[International PEN]].&lt;ref name="Linguistic Human Rights"&gt;{{cite book|title=Linguistic Human Rights: Overcoming Linguistic Discrimination|year=1995|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|location=Berlin|pages=99–100|url=https://books.google.com.sg/books?id=Jo3NobRqFUQC&amp;lpg=PA98&amp;dq=universal%20declaration%20of%20linguistic%20rights&amp;pg=PA99#v=onepage&amp;q=universal%20declaration%20of%20linguistic%20rights&amp;f=false|author=Skutnabb-Kangas, T., Phillipson, R. &amp; Rannut, M.|accessdate=10 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of 1994, a team was rooted to facilitate the process of writing the official document. About 40 experts from different countries and fields were involved in the first 12 drafts of the Declaration.&lt;ref name="CulturalRights.net" /&gt; Progressively, there were continuous efforts in revising and improving the Declaration as people contributed ideas to be included in it.

===Adoption===

It was on 6 June 1996, during the World Conference on Linguistic Rights in [[Barcelona]], [[Spain]], that the Declaration was acknowledged. The Conference, which was an initiative of the Translations and Linguistic Rights Commission of the [[International PEN|International PEN Club]] and the CIEMEN (Escarre International Center for Ethnic Minorities and the Nations), comprised 61 [[Non-governmental organization|NGOs]], 41 [[International PEN|PEN]] Centers and 40 experts. The document was signed and presented to a representative of the [[UNESCO]] Director General.&lt;ref name="CulturalRights.net" /&gt;&lt;ref name="UDLR Book" /&gt; However, this does not mean that the Declaration has gained approval.

In the same year, the Declaration was published in [[Catalan language|Catalan]], [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]]. It was later translated into other languages, some of which include [[Galician language|Galician]], [[Basque language|Basque]], [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Nynorsk]], [[Sardinian language|Sardinian]].

Even so, there have been continuous efforts to bring the Declaration through as [[UNESCO]] did not officially endorse the UDLR at its General Conference in 1996,&lt;ref name="FIPLV and Language Rights" /&gt; and also in subsequent years, although they morally supported it.

As a result, a Follow-up Committee of the Universal Declaration of Linguistic Rights (FCUDLR) was created by the World Conference on Linguistic Rights. The FCUDLR is also represented by the CIEMEN, which is a [[Nonprofit organization|non-profit]] and [[Non-governmental organization|non-government organisation]].&lt;ref name="CIEMEN"&gt;{{cite news|title=CIEMEN presents a follow-up document before the Chairman of the UN Human Rights Council|url=http://www10.gencat.cat/pres_casa_llengues/AppJava/frontend/noticies_detall.jsp?id=95&amp;idioma=5|accessdate=10 March 2012|newspaper=Linguamón News|date=25 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main objectives of having a follow-up committee was to 1) garner support, especially from international bodies, so as to lend weight to the Declaration and see it through to [[UNESCO]], 2) to maintain contact with [[UNESCO]] and take into account the many viewpoints of its delegates, and 3) to spread awareness of the UDLR and establish a web of support.&lt;ref name="FCUDLR Bulletin" /&gt;

Consequently, the committee started a Scientific Council consisting of professionals in Linguistic Law. The duty of the Council is to update and improve the Declaration from time to time by gathering suggestions&lt;ref name="UDLR Book" /&gt; from those who are keen on the issue of linguistic rights.

The following summarises the progress of the UDLR:

==Contents and Themes==
{{Expand section|date=May 2013}}

===Structure===
The preamble of the Declaration provides six reasons underlying the motivations to promote the stated principles.

To ensure clarity in applicability across diverse linguistic environments, the declaration has included a preliminary title that addresses the definitions of concepts used in its articles (Articles 1-6).&lt;ref name="UDLR Book"&gt;{{cite book|title=Book of the Universal Declaration of Linguistic Rights|year=1998|publisher=Harcourt Brace &amp; Company|location=Orlando (Florida)|url=http://www.linguistic-declaration.org/versions/angles.pdf|author=Follow-up Committee of the Universal Declaration of Linguistic Rights|accessdate=9 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Title One (Articles 7-14) lists general principles asserting equal linguistic rights for language communities and for the individual. Besides the main principles, the second title delves into an overall linguistic régime and is further divided into 6 sections. Section 1 (Articles 15-22) addresses language usage related to public administration and official bodies. Section 2 (Articles 23-30) touches on linguistic rights involving educational fields. 
Section 3 (Articles 31-34) defines linguistic rights concerning [[onomastics|naming]], while Section 4 (Articles 35-40) asserts the entitlement of language groups to mass media resources and new technologies. Section 5 (Articles 41-46) outlines the rights related to cultural artifacts. The last section of the second title, Section 6 (Article 47-52), touches on the individual or language group's rights in the socioeconomic sphere.

The Additional Dispositions call for the obligation of public powers to take measures ensuring the application of these rights and to inform other related bodies of these proclamations. As for the Final Dispositions, the founding of a Council of the Languages within the [[United Nations]] Organization is put forth, as well as the creation of a World Commission for Linguistic Rights, which is to be an unofficial, consultative council composed of experts in non-governmental organizations and those in the field of linguistic law.&lt;ref name="UNESCO's UDLR"&gt;{{cite web|title=Universal Declaration of Linguistic Rights|url=http://www.unesco.org/cpp/uk/declarations/linguistic.pdf|work=Major Non-Governmental Documents, UNESCO.org|publisher=UNESCO: Culture of Peace Programme|accessdate=9 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Opening Article===
'''Preliminary Title: Article 1'''

1. This Declaration considers as a language community any human society established historically
in a particular territorial space, whether this space be recognized or not, which identifies itself as a
people and has developed a common language as a natural means of communication and cultural
cohesion among its members. The term language specific to a territory refers to the language of the
community historically established in such a space.&lt;ref name="UNESCO's UDLR" /&gt;

==Reactions==

One of the comments made was on the idealistic nature of the Declaration. As the Declaration considers all languages equal, it rejects terms such as ‘official’, ‘regional’ or ‘minority’ languages and strongly advocates the full use of all historic community languages.&lt;ref name="Languages of Israel"/&gt;

Drawing from the articles pertaining to the educational issues (Articles 25, 26 and 30), it is stated that the education system should fully support the development of their community languages and other languages they wish to know in schools to the point of fluency and capability to use it in all social situations. In addition, research on language and culture of language communities is to be done at the university level. It has been argued that the 'rights' stated in those articles will remain the privilege of powerful language communities.&lt;ref name="Linguistic genocide in education, or worldwide diversity and human rights?"&gt;{{cite book|title=Linguistic genocide in education, or worldwide diversity and human rights?|year=2000|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc|location=Mahwah, NJ|pages=543|author=Tove Skutnabb-Kangas|accessdate=15 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reason is that since the Declaration requires authorities to issue sanctions in the event of violation of the proclaimed rights, doubts have arisen regarding the likelihood of any government adopting the document.&lt;ref name="Language endangerment and language revitalization: an introduction"&gt;{{cite book|title=Language endangerment and language revitalization: an introduction|year=2006|publisher=Mouton de Gruyter|location=Berlin|pages=146|url=https://books.google.com.sg/books?id=Xej-BQK9YEcC&amp;pg=PA52&amp;lpg=PA&amp;dq=impacts+universal+declaration+of+linguistic+rights&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=vkGb0koIPh&amp;sig=rjqTbxbl35KdVCc4fJEkT-7wML4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=1JpVT5SwBcPnrAfNtvCNBw&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwADgK#v=onepage&amp;q=universal%20declaration%20of%20linguistic%20rights&amp;f=false|author=Tasaku Tsunoda|accessdate=10 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many governmental groups (other than the regional authorities in [[Spain]] such as [[Catalonia]], [[Menorca]] and [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque]]) in most countries find it hard to reconcile these fundamental principles of the Declaration with their current language policies and practices.&lt;ref name="Languages of Israel"/&gt;
There is a need to balance between regulations imposed by governments and the protection of the rights of the people in different language communities. Considerations such as acknowledging the primary human rights of minority peoples (e.g. issues of physical survival) are, instead, regarded as more dire than an issue like linguistic rights. Linguistic rights will hence be ignored before primary human rights can be properly attended to. Furthermore, the cost involved in executing sanctions is another cause of concern.&lt;ref name="Language endangerment and language revitalization: an introduction"/&gt; The main issue, however, is the fact that the article is not legally binding and duty-holders are never specified.&lt;ref name="Linguistic genocide in education, or worldwide diversity and human rights?"/&gt;

Other responses include the issue that more rights are given to ‘language communities’ in the Declaration. In the context of education, it is observed that other than language communities (equivalent to ‘national territorially based minorities'), those who do not fit under this category will have to ‘assimilate’, as having the right to education in the language of the territory does not necessarily equate to having the right to an education in one’s own language.&lt;ref name="Linguistic genocide in education, or worldwide diversity and human rights?"/&gt;

==Developments==

===Efforts in Ratification===

The Declaration is not [[International law|constitutional]] and has not been ratified by the [[United Nations General Assembly|UN General Assembly]], unlike the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]]. Despite the Follow-up Committee’s publication of the text in 1998,&lt;ref name="UDLR Book" /&gt; which was backed by letters of support from world leaders, [[UNESCO]] has not ratified the document.&lt;ref name="International PEN page on UNESCO Portal" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FIPLV and Language Rights"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Fédération Internationale des Professeurs de Langues Vivantes (FIPLV) and Language Rights|url=http://www.atriumlinguarum.org/contenido/langrights.pdf|publisher=Observatorio Atrium Linguarum|accessdate=9 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;   On 19 April 2002, CIEMEN and [[International PEN]] convoked a summit during the World Congress on Language Policies in Barcelona. The FIPLV suggested that it would modify the Declaration so that it would be accepted and implemented. There were also further efforts to foster support for the UDLR through proposals and conferences in 2003.&lt;ref name="FIPLV and Language Rights" /&gt;

Since 2008, CIEMEN has been lobbying to place linguistic rights on the agenda of the states that are currently members of the [[United Nations Human Rights Council]] (UNHRC). Despite the positive responses to the document, member states perceived a lack of consensus on the matter and did not wish to be among the first to adopt the proposal. An event organised in Geneva in 2008, entitled ''Linguistic Rights to enhance Human Rights'', which coincided with the Eighth Session of the [[United Nations Human Rights Council|UNHRC]], aimed to garner support for a draft resolution for the UDLR to be presented at the September session of the [[United Nations Human Rights Council|UNHRC]] conference. Ambassadors from [[Mexico]], [[Bolivia]], [[Chile]], [[Armenia]] and [[Nigeria]] expressed their support in a series of interviews. Later in September, the Advisory Committee of the [[United Nations Human Rights Council|UNHRC]] was called upon to take steps to present a proposal, in hopes that the UDLR could be added to the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]].&lt;ref name="Nationalia: Linguistic rights closer to recognition by UN"&gt;{{cite news|title=Linguistic rights closer to being recognized by UN|url=http://www.nationalia.info/en/news/271|accessdate=9 March 2012|newspaper=Nationalia|date=27 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Girona Manifesto===
The Girona Manifesto was developed by [[International PEN]]'s Translation and Linguistic Rights in May 2011 to commemorate the fifteenth anniversary of the Declaration.&lt;ref name=www20.gencat.cat&gt;{{cite web|title=Catalan chapter of the International PEN organization leads revisions to Universal Declaration of Linguistic Rights|url=http://www20.gencat.cat/portal/site/afersexteriors/menuitem.548116b848978a59fea66dfbb0c0e1a0/?vgnextoid=ae30321283550310VgnVCM1000008d0c1e0aRCRD&amp;vgnextchannel=ae30321283550310VgnVCM1000008d0c1e0aRCRD&amp;vgnextfmt=detall&amp;contentid=eaeac4966c681310VgnVCM1000008d0c1e0aRCRD&amp;newLang=en_GB|publisher=gencat|accessdate=10 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Girona Manifesto is an updated version that condenses the primary principles of the UDLR to aid its implementation. In September 2011, the manifesto was ratified by the International PEN Assembly of Delegates at the 77th Congress.&lt;ref name=pen-international.org1&gt;{{cite web|title=The Girona Manifesto: Encapsulating the Universal Declaration of Linguistic Rights|url=http://www.pen-international.org/newsitems/the-girona-manifesto-encapsulating-the-universal-declaration-of-linguistic-rights/
|publisher=International PEN|accessdate=10 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The content of the manifesto is based on the Universal Declaration’s 10 central principles. In contrast to the comprehensive and complex declaration which plays an important role in the field of linguistics and politics, the manifesto is laid out in a concise and practical way, intended to be ‘translated and disseminated as a tool to defend linguistic diversity around the world'. The goal is to bring attention the issue of language rights back to the international agenda.&lt;ref name="pen-international.org1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pen-international.org" /&gt;

It is thought to be an important step toward protecting and promoting all of the world's languages, including the ones at risk of extinction.&lt;ref name="pen-international.org2"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Girona Manifesto Press Release|url=http://www.pen-international.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/15092011.pdf|publisher=International PEN|accessdate=10 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As [[John Ralston Saul]], President of [[International PEN]] mentioned, "[It] could give us a clear public document with which to defend and advance languages with smaller populations as well as endangered languages".&lt;ref name="pen-international.org1" /&gt;

On 5 March 2012, the Girona Manifesto and its translated versions were presented at an event organized by Catalan PEN Centre. It was held at the Palau de la Generalitat, Barcelona.&lt;ref name=pen-international.orgnewsitems&gt;{{cite web|title=Girona Manifesto translation appeal|url=http://pen-international.org/newsitems/girona-manifesto-translation-appeal/|publisher=International PEN|accessdate=13 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The manifesto has been translated in 32 languages to date.&lt;ref name=pen-international.orgnewsitems1&gt;{{cite web|title=Girona Manifesto On Linguistic Rights|url=http://www.pen-international.org/who-we-are/translation-linguistic-rights/girona-manifesto/|publisher=International PEN|accessdate=13 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Text of the Girona Manifesto on Linguistic Rights''':&lt;ref name=pen-international.org&gt;{{cite web|title=Girona Manifesto on Linguistic Rights (English)|url=http://pen-international.org/who-we-are/translation-linguistic-rights/girona-manifesto/girona-manifesto-on-linguistic-rights/|publisher=International PEN|accessdate=10 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

1. Linguistic diversity is a world heritage that must be valued and protected.

2. Respect for all languages and cultures is fundamental to the process of constructing and maintaining dialogue and peace in the world.

3. All individuals learn to speak in the heart of a community that gives them life, language, culture and identity.

4. Different languages and different ways of speaking are not only means of communication; they are also the milieu in which humans grow and cultures are built.

5. Every linguistic community has the right for its language to be used as an official language in its territory.

6. School instruction must contribute to the prestige of the language spoken by the linguistic community of the territory.

7. It is desirable for citizens to have a general knowledge of various languages, because it favours empathy and intellectual openness, and contributes to a deeper knowledge of one’s own tongue.

8. The translation of texts, especially the great works of various cultures, represents a very important element in the necessary process of greater understanding and respect among human beings.

9. The media is a privileged loudspeaker for making linguistic diversity work and for competently and rigorously increasing its prestige.

10. The right to use and protect one’s own language must be recognized by the United Nations as one of the fundamental human rights

'''''The Urbino European Law Seminar''''' is a summer course organized every year since 1959 by the Center for European Legal Studies of Urbino. The lectures are held in French, Italian and English at the Law Faculty of [[University of Urbino|Urbino University]], by visiting lecturers from many European countries and focus on current issues of [[European law]], [[private international law]], [[comparative law]] and Italian law. 

Following the seminar, participants are given a certificate as proof of their attendance. Depending on the specialty selected&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.univ-paris1.fr/uploads/media/Certificate.and.diplomas.pdf Regulation of the Center for European Legal Studies of Urbino.]&lt;/ref&gt; and if successful in examination, participants are also awarded a diploma from the Law Faculty of [[University of Urbino|Urbino University]] in either comparative law, European studies, advanced studies in European Law, or advanced European studies.

== History ==
The Urbino European Law Seminar was inaugurated on the 24th of August 1959&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/ridc_0035-3337_1959_num_11_4_11303 Report of the inaugural session] : [S.N.], «"Corsi estivi" de la Faculté de droit de l'Université d'Urbino», ''Revue internationale de droit comparé'', 1959, pp. 550-751.&lt;/ref&gt; by Henri Batiffol, Phocion Francescakis, Alessandro Migliazza, Francesco Capotorti, Enrico Paleari and Germain Bruillard. Until 2004, [[Cino Del Duca|Cino]] and [[Simone Del Duca]] were the seminar's main benefactors.

Note the surge in 1828 ([[Jacksonian democracy|extension of suffrage to non-property-owning white men]]), the drop from 1890–1910 (when Southern states [[Disenfranchisement after the Reconstruction Era|disenfranchised most African Americans and many poor whites]]), and another surge in 1920 ([[Women's suffrage in the United States|extension of suffrage to women]]).]]

The issue of '''voting rights in the United States''', specifically the [[Suffrage|enfranchisement and disenfranchisement]] of different groups, has been contested throughout [[History of the United States|United States history]].

Eligibility to vote in the United States is established both through the [[United States Constitution|federal constitution]] and by state law. Several constitutional amendments (the [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|15th]], [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|19th]], and [[Twenty-sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution|26th]] specifically) require that voting rights cannot be abridged on account of race, color, previous condition of servitude, sex, or age for those above 18; the constitution as originally written did not establish any such rights during 1787–1870. In the absence of a specific federal law or constitutional provision, each state is given considerable discretion to establish qualifications for suffrage and candidacy within its own respective jurisdiction; in addition, states and lower level jurisdictions establish election systems, such as [[at-large]] or [[single member district]] elections for county councils or school boards.

Beyond qualifications for suffrage, rules and regulations concerning voting (such as the [[Poll tax (United States)|poll tax]]) have been contested since the advent of [[Jim Crow laws]] and related provisions that indirectly disenfranchised racial minorities. Since the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]], the [[Twenty-fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|24th Amendment to the Constitution]], and related laws, voting rights have been legally considered an issue related to election systems. The [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] [[Reynolds v. Sims|ruled in 1964]] that both houses of all state legislatures had to be based on election districts that were relatively equal in population size, under the "[[one man, one vote]]" principle. In 1972, the Court ruled that state legislatures had to redistrict every ten years based on census results; at that point, many had not redistricted for decades, often leading to a rural bias.

In other cases{{Which|date=June 2016}}, particularly for county or municipal elections, [[at-large]] voting has been repeatedly challenged when found to dilute the voting power of significant minorities in violation of the Voting Rights Act. In the early 20th century, numerous cities established small commission forms of government in the belief that "better government" could result from the suppression of ward politics. Commissioners were elected by the majority of voters, excluding candidates who could not afford large campaigns or who appealed to a minority. Generally the solution to such violations has been to adopt [[single-member districts]] (SMDs) but alternative election systems, such as [[limited voting]] or [[cumulative voting]], have also been used since the late 20th century to correct for dilution of voting power and enable minorities to elect candidates of their choice.

The [[District of Columbia]] and 5 major [[territories of the United States]] have [[Non-voting members of the United States House of Representatives|one non-voting member]] each (in the [[U.S. House of Representatives]]) and no representation in the [[U.S. Senate]]. People in the U.S. territories cannot vote for [[president of the United States]].&lt;ref name="Territories_vote"&gt;http://time.com/3736845/john-oliver-last-week-tonight-voting-rights/ ''Watch John Oliver Cast His Ballot for Voting Rights for U.S. Territories.'' Time.com. Melissa Locker. March 9, 2015. Retrieved January 1, 2018&lt;/ref&gt; People in the District of Columbia can vote for the president because of the [[Twenty-third Amendment to the United States Constitution|23rd Amendment]].

== Background ==
The [[United States Constitution]] did not originally define who was eligible to vote, allowing each state to determine who was eligible. In the early history of the U.S., most states allowed only [[White American|white]] male adult property owners to vote.&lt;ref name=NatArchives&gt;{{cite web|title=Expansion of Rights and Liberties - The Right of Suffrage|url=https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/charters_of_freedom_13.html|website=Online Exhibit: The Charters of Freedom|publisher=National Archives|accessdate=April 21, 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160706144856/http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/charters_of_freedom_13.html|archivedate=July 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=U.S. Voting Rights|url=http://www.infoplease.com/timelines/voting.html|publisher=Infoplease|accessdate=21 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Voting in Early America|journal=Colonial Williamsburg|volume=Spring 2007|url=http://www.history.org/Foundation/journal/spring07/elections.cfm|accessdate=21 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Freed slaves could vote in four states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Murrin|first1=John M.|last2=Johnson|first2=Paul E.|last3=McPherson|first3=James M.|last4=Fahs|first4=Alice|last5=Gerstle|first5=Gary|title=Liberty, Equality, Power: A History of the American People|date=2012|publisher=Wadsworth, Cengage Learning|isbn=978-0-495-90499-1|page=296|edition=6th|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FGSQOiy6uZUC&amp;pg=PT337#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women were largely prohibited from voting, as were men without property. Women could vote in [[New Jersey]] until 1807 (provided they could meet the property requirement) and in some local jurisdictions in other northern states. Non-white Americans could also vote in these jurisdictions, provided they could meet the property requirement. By 1856, white men were allowed to vote in all states regardless of property ownership, although requirements for paying tax remained in five states.&lt;ref name=NBER2005&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Stanley L.

Four of the fifteen post-Civil War constitutional amendments were ratified to extend voting rights to different groups of citizens. These extensions state that voting rights cannot be denied or abridged based on the following:
* "Race, color, or previous condition of servitude" ([[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|15th Amendment]], 1870)
* "On account of sex" ([[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|19th Amendment]], 1920)
* "By reason of failure to pay any [[Poll tax (United States)|poll tax]] or other tax" for federal elections ([[Twenty-fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|24th Amendment]], 1964)&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;For state elections: ''[[Harper v. Virginia Board of Elections]]'', {{ussc|383|663}} (1966))&lt;/ref&gt;
* "Who are eighteen years of age or older, to vote, shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any state on account of age" ([[Twenty-sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution|26th Amendment]], 1971)

Following the [[Reconstruction Era]] until the culmination of the [[Civil Rights Movement]], [[Jim Crow laws]] such as [[literacy test]]s, [[poll tax (United States)|poll taxes]], and religious tests were some of the state and local laws used in various parts of the United States to deny immigrants (including legal ones and newly [[History of laws concerning immigration and naturalization in the United States|naturalized]] citizens), non-white citizens, Native Americans, and any other locally "undesirable" groups from exercising voting rights granted under the constitution.&lt;ref name="VG"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://congressbase.com/40/voting-guide-how-to-cast-your-vote-participate-in-government-and-have-your-voice-heard/|title=Voting Guide: How To Cast Your Vote, Participate In Government And Have Your Voice Heard|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Congress Base|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022120322/http://congressbase.com/40/voting%2Dguide%2Dhow%2Dto%2Dcast%2Dyour%2Dvote%2Dparticipate%2Din%2Dgovernment%2Dand%2Dhave%2Dyour%2Dvoice%2Dheard/|archive-date=2013-10-22|dead-url=yes|accessdate=2013-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of such state and local discriminatory practices, over time, the federal role in elections has increased, through amendments to the Constitution and enacted legislation. These reforms in the 19th and 20th centuries extended the franchise to non-whites, those who do not own property, women, and those 18–21 years old.

Since the "right to vote" is not explicitly stated in the U.S. Constitution except in the above referenced amendments, and only in reference to the fact that the franchise cannot be denied or abridged based solely on the aforementioned qualifications, the "right to vote" is perhaps better understood, in layman's terms, as only prohibiting certain forms of legal discrimination in establishing qualifications for suffrage. States may deny the "right to vote" for other reasons. For example, many states require eligible citizens to register to vote a set number of days prior to the election in order to vote. More controversial restrictions include those laws that [[felony disenfranchisement|prohibit convicted felons from voting]], even those who have served their sentences. Another example, seen in ''[[Bush v. Gore]]'', are disputes as to what rules should apply in counting or recounting ballots.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

A state may choose to fill an office by means other than an election. For example, upon death or resignation of a legislator, the state may allow the affiliated political party to choose a replacement to hold office until the next scheduled election. Such an appointment is often affirmed by the governor.&lt;ref name="justia voter" /&gt;

The Constitution, in Article VI, clause (paragraph) 3, does state that "no religious Test shall ever be required as a Qualification to any Office or public Trust under the United States".

=== Native American people ===
From 1778 to 1871, the government tried to resolve its relationship with the various native tribes by negotiating treaties. These treaties formed agreements between two sovereign nations, stating that Native American people were citizens of their tribe, living within the boundaries of the United States. The treaties were negotiated by the executive branch and ratified by the U.S. Senate. It said that native tribes would give up their rights to hunt and live on huge parcels of land that they had inhabited in exchange for trade goods, yearly cash [[Life annuity|annuity]] payments, and assurances that no further demands would be made on them. Most often, part of the land would be "reserved" exclusively for the tribe's use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nur|first=Alio|title=A Long History of Treaties|url=http://www.nebraskastudies.org/0700/frameset_reset.html?http://www.nebraskastudies.org/0700/stories/0701_0140.html|publisher=Native American Citizenship|accessdate=2013-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the 1800s, many native tribes gradually lost claim to the lands they had inhabited for centuries through the federal government's [[Indian Removal]] policy to relocate tribes from the Southeast and Northwest to west of the [[Mississippi River]]. European-American settlers continued to encroach on western lands. Only in 1879, in the [[Standing Bear]] trial, were American Indians recognized as persons in the eyes of the United States government. Judge [[Elmer Scipio Dundy]] of [[Nebraska]] declared that Indians were people within the meaning of the laws, and they had the rights associated with a writ of [[habeas corpus]]. However, Judge Dundy left unsettled the question as to whether Native Americans were guaranteed US citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Alio|first=Nur|title=Native American Citizenship|url=http://www.nebraskastudies.org/0700/frameset_reset.html?http://www.nebraskastudies.org/0700/stories/0701_0140.html|publisher=nebraska studies.org|accessdate=2013-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Native Americans were born within the national boundaries of the United States, those on reservations were considered citizens of their own tribes, rather than of the United States. They were denied the right to vote because they were not considered citizens by law and were thus ineligible. Many Native Americans were told that they would become citizens if they gave up their tribal affiliations in 1887 under the [[Dawes Act]], which allocated communal lands to individual households and was intended to aid in the assimilation of Native Americans into majority culture. This still did not guarantee their right to vote. In 1924, the remaining Native Americans, estimated at about one-third, became United States citizens through the [[Indian Citizenship Act]]. Many western states, however, continued to restrict Native American ability to vote through property requirements, economic pressures, hiding the polls, and condoning of physical violence against those who voted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Alio|first=NUr|title=Native American Citizenship|url=http://www.nebraskastudies.org/0700/frameset_reset.html?http://www.nebraskastudies.org/0700/stories/0701_0140.html|publisher=nebraska studies.org|accessdate=2013-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the late 20th century, they have been protected under provisions of the Voting Rights Act as a racial minority, and in some areas, language minority, gaining election materials in their native languages.

With the growth in the number of [[Baptists in the United States|Baptists]] in Virginia before the Revolution, who challenged the established Anglican Church, the issues of [[Freedom of religion in the United States|religious freedom]] became important to rising leaders such as [[James Madison]]. As a young lawyer, he defended Baptist preachers who were not licensed by (and were opposed by) the established state [[Anglican Church in America|Anglican Church]]. He carried developing ideas about religious freedom to be incorporated into the [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|constitutional convention of the United States]].

In 1787, [[Article One of the United States Constitution]] stated that "the Electors in each State shall have the Qualifications requisite for Electors of the most numerous Branch of the State Legislature". More significantly, [[Article Six of the United States Constitution|Article Six]] disavowed the religious test requirements of several states, saying: "[N]o religious Test shall ever be required as a Qualification to any Office or public Trust under the United States."

Several states granted suffrage to [[free people of color|free men of color]] after the Revolution, including North Carolina. This fact was noted by [[Benjamin Robbins Curtis|Justice Benjamin Robbins Curtis']] dissent in ''[[Dred Scott v. Sandford]]'' (1857), as he emphasized that blacks had been considered citizens at the time the Constitution was ratified:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Of this there can be no doubt. At the time of the ratification of the Articles of Confederation, all free native-born inhabitants of the States of New Hampshire, Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey, and North Carolina, though descended from African slaves, were not only citizens of those States, but such of them as had the other necessary qualifications possessed the franchise of electors, on equal terms with other citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Curtis|first=Benjamin Robbins (Justice)|title=''Dred Scott v.

* In the 1820s, New York State enlarged its franchise to white men by dropping the property qualification, but maintained it for free blacks.
* The Supreme Court of North Carolina had upheld the ability of free African Americans to vote in that state. In 1835, because of fears of the role of free blacks after [[Nat Turner's Slave Rebellion]] of 1831, they were disenfranchised by decision of the North Carolina Constitutional Convention. At the same time, convention delegates relaxed religious and property qualifications for whites, thus expanding the franchise for them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

* Alabama entered the union in 1819 with universal white suffrage provided in its constitution.

When the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] was ratified in 1868 after the Civil War, it granted citizenship to all persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to its jurisdiction. In 1869, the Fifteenth Amendment prohibited the government from denying a citizen the right to vote based on that citizen's "race, color, or previous condition of servitude". The major effect of these amendments was to enfranchise [[African American]] men, the overwhelming majority of whom were [[freedmen]] in the South.&lt;ref name="Alio"&gt;{{cite web|last=Alio|first=Nur|title=African American Men Get the Vote|url=http://www.iwantmyvote.com/recount/history/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060406194823/http://www.iwantmyvote.com/recount/history/|archivedate=2006-04-06|publisher=Cobb-LaMarche}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war, some southern states passed "Black Codes", state laws to restrict the new freedoms of African Americans. They attempted to control their movement, assembly, working conditions and other civil rights. Some states also prohibited them from voting.&lt;ref name="Alio" /&gt;

The [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifteenth Amendment]] to the Constitution, one of three ratified after the [[American Civil War]] to grant freedmen full rights of citizenship, prevented any state from denying the right to vote to any citizen based on race. This was primarily related to protecting the franchise of freedmen, but it also applied to non-white minorities, such as [[History of Mexican Americans in Texas|Mexican Americans in Texas]]. The state governments under [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]] adopted new state constitutions or amendments designed to protect the ability of freedmen to vote. The white resistance to black suffrage after the war regularly erupted into violence as white groups tried to protect their power. Particularly in the [[U.S. Southern states|South]], in the aftermath of the Civil War whites made efforts to suppress [[Free negro|freedmen]]'s voting. In the 1860s, secret [[vigilante]] groups such as the [[Ku Klux Klan]] (KKK) used violence and intimidation to keep freedmen in a controlled role and reestablish white supremacy. But, black freedmen registered and voted in high numbers, and many were elected to local offices through the 1880s.

In the mid-1870s, the insurgencies continued with a rise in more powerful white [[paramilitary organizations|paramilitary groups]], such as the [[White League]], originating in [[Louisiana]] in 1874 after a disputed gubernatorial election; and the [[Red Shirts (Southern United States)|Red Shirts]], originating in [[Mississippi]] in 1875 and developing numerous chapters in North and [[South Carolina]]; as well as other "White Line" rifle clubs. They operated openly, were more organized than the KKK, and directed their efforts at political goals: to disrupt Republican organizing, turn Republicans out of office, and intimidate or kill blacks to suppress black voting. They worked as "the military arm of the Democratic Party".&lt;ref name=rable&gt;{{cite book|last=Rable|first=George C.|title=But There Was No Peace: The Role of Violence in the Politics of Reconstruction|date=2007|publisher=University of Georgia Press|location=[[Athens, Georgia|Athens, GA]]|isbn=978-0-8203-3011-2|page=132 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8qn37CH-i9IC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, estimates were that 150 blacks were killed in North Carolina before the 1876 elections. Economic tactics such as eviction from rental housing or termination of employment were also used to suppress the black vote.  White Democrats regained power in state legislatures across the South by the late 1870s, and the federal government withdrew its troops as a result of a national compromise related to the presidency, officially ending Reconstruction.

African Americans were a majority in three southern states following the Civil War, and represented over 40% of the population in four other states. While they did not elect a majority of African Americans to office in any state legislature during Reconstruction, whites still feared and resented the political power exercised by freedmen.&lt;ref&gt;Gabriel J. Chin &amp; Randy Wagner, [http://www.law.harvard.edu/students/orgs/crcl/vol43_1/65-126.pdf "The Tyranny of the Minority: Jim Crow and the Counter-Majoritarian Difficulty"], 43 ''Harvard Civil Rights-Civil Liberties Law Review'' 65 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;  After ousting the Republicans, whites worked to restore white supremacy.

Although elections were often surrounded by violence, blacks continued to vote and gained many local offices in the late 19th century. In the late 19th century, a Populist-Republican coalition in several states gained governorships and some congressional seats in 1894. To prevent such a coalition from forming again and reduce election violence, the Democratic Party, dominant in all southern state legislatures, took action to disfranchise most blacks and many poor whites outright.

From 1890 to 1908, ten of the eleven former Confederate states completed political suppression and exclusion of these groups by ratifying new constitutions or amendments which incorporated provisions to make voter registration more difficult. These included such requirements as payment of [[Poll tax (United States)|poll taxes]], complicated record keeping, complicated timing of registration and length of residency in relation to elections, with related record-keeping requirements; [[felony disenfranchisement]] focusing on crimes thought to be committed by African Americans,&lt;ref&gt;Gabriel J. Chin, [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=433580&amp;high=%20Gabriel%20CHin "Reconstruction, Felon Disenfranchisement and the Right to Vote: Did the Fifteenth Amendment Repeal Section&amp;nbsp;2 of the Fourteenth?"], 92 ''[[Georgetown Law Journal]]'' 259 (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[literacy test]] or comprehension test.

Prospective voters had to prove the ability to read and write the [[English language]] to white voter registrars, who in practice applied subjective requirements. [[African Americans|Blacks]] were often denied the right to vote on this basis. Even well-educated blacks were often told they had "failed" such a test, if in fact, it had been administered.  On the other hand, illiterate [[whites]] were sometimes allowed to vote through a "[[grandfather clause]]," which waived literacy requirements if one's grandfather had been a qualified voter before 1866, or had served as a soldier, or was from a foreign country. As most blacks had grandfathers who were slaves before 1866 and could not have fulfilled any of those conditions, they could not use the grandfather clause exemption. Selective enforcement of the [[Poll tax (United States)|poll tax]] was frequently also used to disqualify black and poor white voters. As a result of these measures, at the turn of the century voter rolls dropped markedly across the South. Most blacks and many poor whites were excluded from the political system for decades. Unable to vote, they were also excluded from juries or running for any office.

In Alabama, for example, its 1901 constitution restricted the franchise for poor whites as well as blacks. It contained requirements for payment of cumulative [[Poll tax (United States)|poll taxes]], completion of [[literacy tests]], and increased residency at state, county and precinct levels, effectively [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disenfranchised]] tens of thousands of [[Poor White|poor whites]] as well as most blacks. Historian J. Morgan Kousser found, "They disfranchised these whites as willingly as they deprived blacks of the vote."&lt;ref&gt;J. Morgan Kousser.''The Shaping of Southern Politics: Suffrage Restriction and the Establishment of the One-Party South'', New Haven: Yale University Press, 1974&lt;/ref&gt; By 1941, more whites than blacks in total had been disenfranchised.&lt;ref name="Glenn Feldman 2004, pp. 135–136"&gt;Glenn Feldman, ''The Disfranchisement Myth: Poor Whites and Suffrage Restriction in Alabama'', Athens: University of Georgia Press, 2004, pp.&amp;nbsp;135–136&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Legal challenges to disfranchisement ====
Although African Americans quickly began legal challenges to such provisions in the 19th century, it was years before any were successful before the [[U.S. Supreme Court]]. [[Booker T. Washington]], better known for his public stance of trying to work within societal constraints of the period at [[Tuskegee University]], secretly helped fund and arrange representation for numerous legal challenges to disfranchisement. He called upon wealthy Northern allies and philanthropists to raise funds for the cause.&lt;ref&gt;Richard H. Pildes, [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=224731 "Democracy, Anti-Democracy, and the Canon"], ''Constitutional Commentary'' 17 (2000): 13-14, accessed Mar 10, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  The Supreme Court's upholding of [[Mississippi]]'s new constitution, in ''[[Williams v. Mississippi]]'' (1898), encouraged other states to follow the Mississippi plan of disfranchisement. African Americans brought other legal challenges, as in ''[[Giles v. Harris]]'' (1903) and ''Giles v. Teasley'' (1904), but the Supreme Court upheld [[Alabama]] constitutional provisions. In 1915 Oklahoma was the last state to append a [[grandfather clause]] to its literacy requirement due to Supreme Court cases.

From early in the 20th century, the newly established [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] ([[NAACP]]) took the lead in organizing or supporting legal challenges to segregation and disfranchisement. Gradually they planned the strategy of which cases to take forward. In ''Guinn v. United States'' (1915), the first case in which the NAACP filed a brief, the Supreme Court struck down the grandfather clause in [[Oklahoma]] and [[Maryland]]. Other states in which it was used had to retract their legislation as well. The challenge was successful.

But, nearly as rapidly as the Supreme Court determined a specific provision was unconstitutional, state legislatures developed new statutes to continue disenfranchisement. For instance, in ''[[Smith v. Allwright]]'' (1944), the Supreme Court struck down the use of state-sanctioned all-white primaries by the Democratic Party in the South. States developed new restrictions on black voting; Alabama passed a law giving county registrars more authority as to which questions they asked applicants in comprehension or literacy tests. The NAACP continued with steady progress in legal challenges to disenfranchisement and segregation.

In 1957, Congress passed the [[Civil Rights Act of 1957]] to implement the Fifteenth Amendment. It established the [[United States Civil Rights Commission]]; among its duties is to investigate voter discrimination.

As late as 1962, programs such as [[Operation Eagle Eye (United States)|Operation Eagle Eye]] in Arizona attempted to stymie minority voting through literacy tests. The [[Twenty-fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|24th Amendment]] was ratified in 1964 to prohibit poll taxes as a condition of voter registration and voting in federal elections. Many states continued to use them in state elections as a means of reducing the number of voters.

The [[American Civil Rights Movement]], through such events as the [[Selma to Montgomery marches]] and Freedom Summer in Mississippi, gained passage by the [[United States Congress]] of the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]], which authorized federal oversight of voter registration and election practices and other enforcement of voting rights. Congress passed the legislation because it found "case by case litigation was inadequate to combat widespread and persistent discrimination in voting". Activism by African Americans helped secure an expanded and protected franchise that has benefited all Americans, including racial and language minorities.

The bill provided for federal oversight, if necessary, to ensure just voter registration and election procedures. The rate of African-American registration and voting in Southern states climbed dramatically and quickly, but it has taken years of federal oversight to work out the processes and overcome local resistance. In addition, it was not until the U.S. Supreme Court ruled 6-3 in ''[[Harper v. Virginia Board of Elections]]'' (1966) that all state poll taxes (for state elections) were officially declared unconstitutional as violating the [[Equal Protection Clause]] of the Fourteenth Amendment. This removed a burden on the poor.&lt;ref name=Scher2015&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=POzqBgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA13&amp;ots=mOZKa1PBCT&amp;pg=PR9#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The Politics of Disenfranchisement: Why is it So Hard to Vote in America?|last=Scher|first=Richard K.|date=2015|page=viii-ix|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781317455363}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NHLTS2009&gt;{{Cite paper|date=2009|title=Civil Rights in America: Racial Voting Rights|url=https://www.nps.gov/nhl/learn/themes/CivilRights_VotingRights.pdf|journal=|publisher=A National Historic Landmarks Theme Study}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Legal challenges have continued under the Voting Rights Act, primarily in areas of redistricting and election systems, for instance, challenging [[at-large]] election systems that effectively reduce the ability of minority groups to elect candidates of their choice. Such challenges have particularly occurred at the county and municipal level, including for school boards, where exclusion of minority groups and candidates at such levels has been persistent in some areas of the country. This reduces the ability of women and minorities to participate in the political system and gain entry-level experience.

=== Women ===
{{See also|History of women's suffrage in the United States}}
A parallel, yet separate, movement was that for [[women's suffrage]]. Leaders of the suffrage movement included [[Susan B. Anthony]], [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]], and [[Alice Paul]]. In some ways this, too, could be said to have grown out of the [[American Civil War]], as women had been strong leaders of the [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolition]] movement.  Middle- and upper-class women generally became more politically active in the northern tier during and after the war.

In 1848, the [[Seneca Falls Convention]], the first [[women's rights]] convention, was held in [[Seneca Falls, New York]]. Of the 300 present, 68 women and 32 men signed the [[Declaration of Sentiments]] which defined the women's rights movement. The first [[National Women's Rights Convention]] took place in 1850 in [[Worcester, Massachusetts]], attracting more than 1,000 participants. This national convention was held yearly through 1860.

When Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton formed the National Women Suffrage Association, their goal was to help women gain voting rights through reliance on the Constitution. Also, in 1869 [[Lucy Stone]] and [[Henry Browne Blackwell|Henry Blackwell]] formed the [[American Woman Suffrage Association]] (AWSA). However, AWSA focused on gaining voting rights for women through the amendment process. Although these two organization were fighting for the same cause, it was not until 1890 that they merged to form the [[National American Woman Suffrage Association]] (NAWSA). After the merger of the two organizations, the (NAWSA) waged a state-by-state campaign to obtain voting rights for women.

[[Wyoming]] was the first state in which women were able to vote, although it was a condition of the transition to statehood. [[Utah]] was the second territory to allow women to vote, but the federal [[Edmunds–Tucker Act]] of 1887 repealed woman's suffrage in Utah. Colorado was the first established state to allow women to vote on the same basis as men. Some other states also extended the franchise to women before the Constitution was amended to this purpose.

During the 1910s Alice Paul, assisted by [[Lucy Burns]] and many others, organized such events and organizations as the [[1913 Women's Suffrage Parade]], the [[National Woman's Party]], and the [[Silent Sentinels]]. At the culmination of the suffragists' requests and protests, ratification of the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Nineteenth Amendment]] gave women the right to vote in time to participate in the [[President of the United States|Presidential]] election of [[US Presidential election, 1920|1920]].

Another political movement that was largely driven by women in the same era was the anti-[[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] [[Temperance movement]], which led to the [[Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Eighteenth Amendment]] and [[Prohibition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=alio|first=nur|title=women|url=http://www.infoplease.com/spot/womenstimeline1.html|publisher=Women's Rights Movement in the U.S.|accessdate=20 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Washington, D.C. ===
[[Washington, D.C.]], was created from a portion of the states of Maryland and Virginia in 1801. The Virginia portion was [[Cession|retroceded]] (returned) to Virginia upon request of the residents, by an Act of Congress in 1846 to protect slavery, and restore state and federal voting rights in that portion of Virginia.  When Maryland delegated a portion of its land to Congress so that it could be used as the Nation's capital, Congress did not continue Maryland Voting Laws. It canceled all state and federal elections starting with 1802.  Local elections limped on in some neighborhoods, until 1871, when local elections were also forbidden by the U.S. Congress. The U.S. Congress is the National Legislature. Under Article&amp;nbsp;I, Section&amp;nbsp;8, Clause 17, Congress has the sole authority to exercise "Exclusive Legislature in all cases whatsoever" over the nation's capital and over federal military bases.  Active disfranchisement is typically a States Rights Legislative issue, where the removal of voting rights is permitted. At the national level, the federal government typically ignored voting rights issues, or affirmed that they were extended.

Congress, when exercising "exclusive legislation" over U.S. Military Bases in the United States, and Washington, D.C., viewed its power as strong enough to remove all voting rights. All state and federal elections were canceled by Congress in D.C. and all of Maryland's voting Rights laws no longer applied to D.C. when Maryland gave up that land. Congress did not pass laws to establish local voting processes in the District of Columbia. This omission of law strategy to disfranchise is contained in the Congressional debates in Annals of Congress in 1800 and 1801.

In 1986, the US Congress voted to restore voting rights on U.S. Military bases for all state and federal elections.

D.C., citizens were granted the right to vote in Presidential elections in 1961, after the ratification of the [[Twenty-third Amendment to the United States Constitution|twenty-third amendment]]. Amendment 23 is the only known limit to U.S. Congressional powers, forcing Congress to enforce Amendments 14, 15, 19, 24, and 26 for the first time in Presidential elections. The Maryland citizens and territory converted in Washington, D.C., in 1801 were represented in 1801 by U.S. Rep. [[John Chew Thomas]] from Maryland's 2nd, and U.S. Rep. [[William Craik]] from Maryland's 3rd Congressional Districts. These Maryland U.S. Congressional Districts were redrawn and removed from Washington, D.C.

No full Congressional elections have been held since in D.C., a gap continuing since 1801. Congress created a non-voting substitute for a U.S. Congressman, a Delegate, between 1871–1875, but then abolished that post as well. Congress permitted restoration of local elections and [[home rule]] for the District on December 24, 1973. In 1971, Congress still opposed restoring the position of a full U.S. Congressman for Washington, D.C. That year it re-established the position of non-voting Delegate to the U.S. Congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://content.time.com/time/politics/article/0,8599,1881791,00.html|title=A Brief History of Washington, D.C.|last=James|first=Randy|date=2009-02-26|newspaper=Time|access-date=2017-02-16|work=|issn=0040-781X|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--Needs expansion to give Congressional reasoning against representation for the District; might also compare to residents of other national capitals, but most were organic, rather than created separately as was the District--&gt;

=== Young people ===

[[File:Voting Rights for 17-year-olds in US States.svg|thumb|right|250px|States (shown in blue) allow 17-year-olds to vote in primaries/caucuses if their 18th birthday is before the general election.]]
A third voting rights movement was won in the 1960s to lower the voting age from twenty-one to eighteen. Activists noted that most of the young men who were being [[conscription|drafted]] to fight in the [[Vietnam War]] were too young to have any voice in the selection of the leaders who were sending them to fight. Some states had already lowered the voting age: notably [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[Kentucky]], and [[Hawaii]], had already permitted voting by persons younger than twenty-one.

The [[Twenty-sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-sixth Amendment]], ratified in 1971, prohibits federal and state laws which set a minimum voting age higher than 18 years. As of 2008, no state has opted for an earlier age, although some state governments have discussed it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.enquirer.com/editions/2004/04/08/loc_votingage09.html|title=Should voting age fall to 16?

=== Prisoners ===
{{See also|Felony disenfranchisement}}
Prisoner voting rights are defined by individual states, and the laws are different from state to state. Some states allow only individuals on probation to vote. Others allow individuals on parole and probation. As of 2012, only Florida, Kentucky and Virginia continue to impose a lifelong denial of the right to vote to all citizens with a [[felony]] record, absent a restoration of rights granted by the [[Governor]] or [[State legislature (United States)|state legislature]].&lt;ref name="SP"&gt;{{cite web|title=Felony Disenfranchisement Laws in the United States|publisher=The Sentencing Project|date=March 2011|url=http://www.sentencingproject.org/doc/publications/fd_statedisenfranchisement.pdf|format=PDF|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119133453/http://www.sentencingproject.org/doc/publications/fd_statedisenfranchisement.pdf|archivedate=2012-01-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in Kentucky, a felon's rights can be restored after the completion of a restoration process to regain civil rights.&lt;ref name="SP" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/02/18/should-convicted-felons-be-allowed-to-vote-after-theyve-served-their-time/|title=Should Felons Be Allowed to Vote After They Have Served Their Time?|first=Michael|last=Gonchar|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, [[Florida]] legislature restored voting rights to convicted felons who had served their sentences. In March 2011, however, Governor [[Rick Scott]] reversed the 2007 reforms. He signed legislation that permanently disenfranchises citizens with past felony convictions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tampabay.com/news/publicsafety/crime/state-toughens-policy-of-restoring-rights-to--freed-felons/1184821 "State toughens policy of restoring rights to freed felons"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131020012121/http://www.tampabay.com/news/publicsafety/crime/state-toughens-policy-of-restoring-rights-to--freed-felons/1184821 |date=2013-10-20 }}, ''[[Tampa Bay Times]]'', August 8, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2005, Iowa Governor [[Tom Vilsack]] issued an executive order restoring the right to vote for all persons who have completed supervision.&lt;ref name="SP" /&gt;  On October 31, 2005, Iowa's Supreme Court upheld mass reenfranchisement of convicted felons. Nine other states disenfranchise felons for various lengths of time following the completion of their probation or parole.

Other than [[Maine]] and [[Vermont]], all U.S. states prohibit felons from voting while they are in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/blogs/stateline/2008/09/23/groups-push-to-expand-exfelon-voting|title=Groups push to expand ex-felon voting|author=Gramlich, John|publisher=Stateline.org|date=2008-09-23|accessdate=2014-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Puerto Rico, felons in prison are allowed to vote in elections.

=== Homelessness ===

==== Obstacles homeless citizens face during voter registration ====
In the 1980s homelessness was recognized as an increasing national problem. By the early 21st century, there have been numerous court cases to help protect the voting rights of persons without a fixed address. Low income and homeless citizens face some obstacles in registering to vote. These obstacles include establishing residency, providing a mailing address, and showing proof of identification. A residency requirement varies from state to state. States cannot require citizens to show residency of more than 30 days before Election Day. The states of Idaho, Maine, Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Wyoming allow voters to register on Election Day. North Dakota does not require voters to register.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Barder|title=American Government and Politics Today|year=2011–2012|publisher=Suzanne Jeans|page=313}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 21st century, homeless persons in all states have the right to register and vote if they satisfy other conditions. In most states, when registering to vote, homeless voters may designate any place of residence, including a street corner, a park, a shelter, or any other location where an individual stays at night. A citizen may only have one residency during registration, but they may switch their registration each time they change locations.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fvap.gov/info/laws/voting-residency-guidelines "Voting Residency Guidelines"], [[Federal Voting Assistance Program]]&lt;/ref&gt; Designating residency is needed to prove that the citizen lives within the district where he or she wishes to vote. Some states also require a mailing address in order to send out the voter ID card, which the individual must show on Election Day. Some states allow individuals to use PO Boxes as mailing addresses; other states allow the address to be that of a local shelter, advocacy organization, outreach center, or anywhere else that accepts mail on behalf of a person registering to vote. States such as Arizona and Nebraska allow homeless citizens to use county court houses or county clerks' offices as mailing address.

States that do not require a mailing address include Alaska, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Montana, New Jersey, Vermont, West Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalhomeless.org/projects/vote/Manual_2011.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

All potential voters face new requirements since 2002, when President Bush signed the [[Help America Vote Act]] (HAVA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eac.gov/about_the_eac/help_america_vote_act.aspx |title=Help America Vote Act of 2002, HAVA &amp;#124; The U.S. Election Assistance Commission (EAC) |publisher= Election Assistance Commission |date= |accessdate=2013-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.opencongress.org/wiki/Help_America_Vote_Act |title=Help America Vote Act |publisher=OpenCongress Wiki |date= |accessdate=2013-06-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130625083933/http://www.opencongress.org/wiki/Help_America_Vote_Act |archivedate=2013-06-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It requires voters to provide their [[Driver's license in the United States|driver's license numbers]], or the last four digits of their [[Social Security Number]] on their voter registration form. This has been enforced.

[[The National Coalition for the Homeless]] (NCH) assists nonprofit organizations, in getting lower income and homeless citizens registered to vote. In 1992, the NCH created a campaign called "You don't need a home to vote".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://gbgm-umc.org/umw/legislative/homeless.html |title="Protect Homeless and their Right to Vote" |access-date=2011-12-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120406111350/http://gbgm-umc.org/umw/legislative/homeless.html |archive-date=2012-04-06 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This campaign provided useful resources and guidelines for nonprofit organizations to follow when assisting citizens to register. Nonprofits, like homeless shelters and [[food bank]]s, set up a voter registration party to help homeless citizens to register. The nonprofit workers must remain nonpartisan when assisting in the registration process.

==== Court cases involving homeless voting ====
Voting rights of the American homeless is an issue that has been addressed in the courts since the 1980s. Each  state is responsible for voting regulations in their area; however, many states throughout America have adopted similar laws regarding homeless citizen voting. Disenfranchising the homeless is considered a violation of their rights under the Fourteenth Amendment's [[Equal Protection Clause]]. Many arguments have been made against homeless people being able to vote. Their status of true citizenship has been called into question because of their lack of residency. However, the courts have ruled on more than one occasion in favor of the homeless voting.

One of the first court cases regarding homeless voting was ''Pitts v. Black'' (1984) in the US District Court of Southern New York, which ruled that disenfranchising homeless citizens is a direct violation of the Equal Protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The case involved the New York Election Board and homeless individuals assisted by the [[Coalition for the Homeless]], among others. The Election Board denied the individuals the right to vote because they resided on the street or in shelters. The Election Board contended that residency required some claim (such as rent) or ownership of the area on which they resided.&lt;ref name="members.fortunecity.com"&gt;{{cite web|title=''Marthaann E.

This ruling encompassed all homeless, including those residing on streets and in parks.&lt;ref name="members.fortunecity.com" /&gt;&lt;ref name="nationalhomeless.org"&gt;{{cite web|title=Court Decisions on Homeless People's Voting Rights|url=http://www.nationalhomeless.org/projects/vote/court.html|publisher=National Coalition for the Homeless|accessdate=4 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two California court rulings, ''Collier v. Menzel'', and ''Walters v. Weed'', also addressed the residency question of homeless voters:
* ''Collier v. Menzel'' (1985): The Santa Barbara District Court case established that a residence could be a certain location rather than a specific address. Howard Menzel, the county clerk, rejected three voter registration applications on the grounds that proper addresses were not provided. The applications simply stated a public park as the applicants' residence. The court overruled the clerk's decision and defined a residence as any fixed location where a person habitually sleeps and where living quarters are set up. In their final decisions, the court stated that denying a citizen the right to vote due to residence in a public park, is a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection clause.&lt;ref name="nationalhomeless.org" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=''Collier v.

* ''Walters v. Weed'' (1988): In 1988, the [[California Supreme Court]] judged a case concerning voter precincts of those who are between residences. The court ruled that when a person leaves his former place of residence and has not yet settled in another permanent living place, then the individual may vote in the precinct of his former residence.&lt;ref name="nationalhomeless.org" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=''Walters v.

==== Special interest elections ====
Several locales retained restrictions for specialized local elections, such as for school boards, [[Special district (United States)|special districts]], or bond issues. Property restrictions, duration of residency restrictions, and, for school boards, restrictions of the franchise to voters with children, remained in force. In a series of rulings from 1969 to 1973, the Court ruled that the franchise could be restricted in some cases to those "primarily interested" or "primarily affected" by the outcome of a specialized election, but not in the case of school boards or bond issues, which affected taxation to be paid by all residents.&lt;ref name="justia voter"&gt;{{Citation

James'' {{ussc|451|335|1981}}, the Court further upheld a system of [[plural voting]], by which votes for the board of directors of a [[water reclamation]] district were allocated on the basis of a person's proportion of land owned in the district.&lt;ref name="justia voter" /&gt;

The Court has overseen operation of political party primaries to ensure open voting. While states were permitted to require voters to register for a political party 30 days before an election, or to require them to vote in only one party primary, the state could not prevent a voter from voting in a party primary if the voter has voted in another party's primary in the last 23 months.&lt;ref name="justia voter" /&gt;  The Court also ruled that a state may not mandate a "closed primary" system and bar independents from voting in a party's primary against the wishes of the party.

The [[Office of Hawaiian Affairs]] of the state of [[Hawaii]], created in 1978, limited voting eligibility and candidate eligibility to [[native Hawaiians]] on whose behalf it manages {{convert|1800000|acre|km2}} of ceded land. The Supreme Court of the United States struck down the franchise restriction under the Fifteenth Amendment in ''[[Rice v. Cayetano]]'' {{ussc|528|495|2000}}, following by eliminating the candidate restriction in ''Arakaki v. State of Hawai'i'' a few months later.

== Current status by region ==

=== District of Columbia ===
{{Main|District of Columbia voting rights}}
Citizens of the nation's capital, [[Washington, D.C.]], have not been apportioned a representative or US senator in Congress. This is because D.C. is a federal district and not a state and under the Constitution, only states are apportioned congresspersons.

District of Columbia citizens had voting rights removed in 1801 by Congress, when Maryland delegated that portion of its land to Congress. Congress incrementally removed effective local control or [[home rule]] by 1871. It restored some home rule in 1971, but maintained the authority to override any local laws. Washington, D.C., does not have full representation in the U.S. House or Senate. The  [[Twenty-third Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-third Amendment]], restoring U.S. Presidential Election after a 164-year-gap, is the only known limit to Congressional "exclusive legislature" from Article I-8-17, forcing Congress to enforce for the first time Amendments 14,15,19, 24, and 26. Amendment 23 gave the District of Columbia three [[U.S. Electoral College|electors]] and hence the right to vote for [[President of the United States|President]], but not full U.S. Congresspersons nor U.S. Senators. In 1978, Congress proposed a constitutional amendment that would have restored to the District a full seat for representation in the [[United States Congress|Congress]] as well. This amendment failed to receive ratification by sufficient number of states within the seven years required.

{{as of|2013}}, [[District of Columbia voting rights#Proposal during administration of Barack Obama|a bill]] is pending in Congress that would treat the District of Columbia as "a congressional district for purposes of representation in the House of Representatives", and permit United States citizens residing in the capital to vote for a member to represent them in the House of Representatives. The District of Columbia House Voting Rights Act, S. 160, 111th Cong. was passed by the [[U.S. Senate]] on February 26, 2009, by a vote of 61-37.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2009/feb/26/senate-votes-give-dc-full-house-vote/|title=Senate votes to give D.C. full House vote|last=Warren|first=Timothy|date=February 26, 2009|publisher=[[The Washington Times]]|accessdate=2009-02-26}} The Senate roll call is here [https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=111&amp;session=1&amp;vote=00073].&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 1, 1993, the [[Inter-American Commission on Human Rights]] of the [[Organization of American States]] received a petition from Timothy Cooper on behalf of the Statehood Solidarity Committee (the "Petitioners") against the government of the United States (the "State" or "United States"). The petition indicated that it was presented on behalf of the members of the Statehood Solidarity Committee and all other U.S. citizens resident in the District of Columbia.  The petition alleged that the United States was responsible for violations of Articles&amp;nbsp;II (right to equality before law) and XX (right to vote and to participate in government) of the [[American Declaration of the Rights and Duties of Man]] in connection with the inability of citizens of the District of Columbia to vote for and elect a representative to the U.S. Congress. On December 29, 2003, The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights having examined the information and arguments provided by the parties on the question of admissibility. Without prejudging the merits of the matter, the Commission decided to admit the present petition in respect of Articles&amp;nbsp;II and XX of the American Declaration. In addition, the Commission concluded that the United States violates the Petitioners' rights under Articles&amp;nbsp;II and XX of the [[American Declaration of the Rights and Duties of Man]] by denying District of Columbia [[Citizenship in the United States|citizens]] an effective opportunity to participate in their [[United States Congress|federal legislature]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dcvote.org/pdfs/oas1203w.pdf Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (Organization of American States) REPORT Nº 98/03*] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111001020855/http://www.dcvote.org/pdfs/oas1203w.pdf |date=2011-10-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Overseas and nonresident citizens ===
U.S. citizens residing overseas who would otherwise have the right to vote are guaranteed the right to vote in federal elections by the [[Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act]] ([[UOCAVA]]) of 1986.&lt;ref name="usdoj.gov" /&gt;  As a practical matter, individual states implement UOCAVA.

A citizen who has never resided in the United States can vote if a parent is eligible to vote in certain states.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

|title=Federal Voting Assistance Program
|publisher=FVAP|accessdate=2008-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In some of these states the citizen can vote in local, state and federal elections, in others in federal elections only.

=== U.S. territories ===

U.S. citizens and non-citizen [[U.S. national|nationals]] who reside in [[American Samoa]], [[Guam]], [[Northern Mariana Islands]], [[Puerto Rico]], or the [[United States Virgin Islands]] are not allowed to vote in U.S. national and presidential elections, as these [[Territories of the United States|U.S. territories]] belong to the United States but do not have presidential electors. The U.S. Constitution requires a voter to be resident in one of the 50 states or in the District of Columbia to vote in federal elections.  To say that the Constitution does not require extension of federal voting rights to U.S. territories residents does not, however, exclude the possibility that the Constitution may permit their enfranchisement under another source of law. Statehood or a constitutional amendment would allow people in the U.S. territories to vote in federal elections.&lt;ref name=iguartia /&gt;

Like the District of Columbia, territories of the United States do not have [[U.S. senators]] representing them in the senate, and they each have one [[Non-voting members of the United States House of Representatives|member of the House of Representatives who is not allowed to vote]].&lt;ref name="Territories_vote"/&gt;

==== Puerto Rico ====
{{Main|Voting rights in Puerto Rico}}
[[Puerto Rico]] is an [[insular area]] — a [[United States]] [[Organized territory|territory]] that is neither a part of one of the fifty [[U.S. state|states]] nor a part of the [[District of Columbia]], the nation's [[federal district]]. Insular areas, such as Puerto Rico, the [[U.S. Virgin Islands]] and [[Guam]], are not allowed to choose electors in [[U.S. presidential election]]s or elect voting members to the [[U.S. Congress]].  This grows out of [[Article One of the United States Constitution|Article&amp;nbsp;I]] and [[Article Two of the United States Constitution|Article&amp;nbsp;II]] of the [[United States Constitution]], which specifically mandate that electors are to be chosen by "the People of the several States". In 1961, the [[Twenty-third Amendment to the United States Constitution|23rd amendment]] to the constitution extended the right to choose electors to the District of Columbia.

Any [[U.S. citizen]] who resides in Puerto Rico (whether a [[Puerto Rican people|Puerto Rican]] or not) is effectively disenfranchised at the national level. Although the Republican Party and Democratic Party chapters in Puerto Rico have selected voting delegates to the national nominating conventions participating in U.S. presidential primaries or caucuses, U.S. citizens not residing in one of the 50 states or in the District of Columbia may not vote in federal elections.

Various scholars (including a prominent U.S. judge in the [[United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit]]) conclude that the U.S. national-electoral process is not fully democratic due to U.S. government disenfranchisement of U.S. citizens residing in Puerto Rico.&lt;ref&gt;Torruella, Juan R. (1985).{{Citation

{{As of|2010}}, under ''Igartúa v. United States'', the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] (ICCPR) is judicially considered not to be [[Self-executing rule|self-executing]], and therefore requires further legislative action to put it into effect domestically. Judge [[Kermit Lipez]] wrote in a concurring opinion, however, that the [[en banc]] majority's conclusion that the ICCPR is non-self-executing is ripe for reconsideration in a new en banc proceeding, and that if issues highlighted in a partial dissent by Judge [[Juan R. Torruella]] were to be decided in favor of the plaintiffs, United States citizens residing in Puerto Rico would have a viable claim to equal voting rights .&lt;ref name="iguartia"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-1st-circuit/1545899.html|title=FindLaw's United States First Circuit case and opinions- ''Gregoria Igartúa et al. v. United States of America et al.'' (Igartúa IV)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Congress has in fact acted in partial compliance with its obligations under the ICCPR when, in 1961, just a few years after the [[United Nations]] first ratified the ICCPR, it amended our fundamental charter to allow the United States citizens who reside in the District of Columbia to vote for the Executive offices. See U.S. Constitutional Amendment XXIII.51. Indeed, a bill is now pending in Congress that would treat the District of Columbia as "a congressional district for purposes of representation in the House of Representatives", and permit United States citizens residing in the capitol to vote for members of the House of Representatives. See District of Columbia House Voting Rights Act, S.160, 111th Congress (passed by the Senate, February 26, 2009) (2009).52  However, the United States has not taken similar "steps" with regard to the five million United States citizens who reside in the other U.S. territories, of which close to four million are residents of Puerto Rico. This inaction is in clear violation of the United States' obligations under the ICCPR".&lt;ref name=iguartia /&gt;

== Accessibility ==
Federal legislation such as the [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990]] (ADA), the [[National Voter Registration Act of 1993]] (NVRA, or "Motor-Voter Act") and the Help America Vote Act of 2001 (HAVA) help to address some of the concerns of disabled and non-English speaking voters in the United States.

Some studies have shown that polling places are inaccessible to disabled voters.&lt;ref name="accessiblesociety.org"&gt;{{cite web|last=alio|first=nur|title=People with Disabilities and Voting|url=http://www.accessiblesociety.org/topics/voting/|publisher=The Center for an Accessible Society|accessdate=2013-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Federal Election Commission]] reported that, in violation of state and federal laws, more than 20,000 polling places across the nation are inaccessible, depriving people with disabilities of their fundamental right to vote.

In 1999, the Attorney General of the State of New York ran a check of polling places around the state to see if they were accessible to voters with disabilities and found many problems. A study of three upstate counties of New York found fewer than 10 percent of polling places fully compliant with state and federal laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/polling-places-found-inaccessible-disabled|title=Polling Places Found Inaccessible To Disabled|last=|first=|date=1999-11-01|website=New York State Attorney General|language=en|access-date=2017-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many polling booths are set in church basements or in upstairs meeting halls where there are no ramps or elevators. This means problems not just for people who use [[wheelchair]]s, but for people using canes or walkers too. And in most states people who are blind do not have access to [[Braille]] ballot to vote; they have to bring someone along to vote for them. Studies have shown that people with disabilities are more interested in government and public affairs than most and are more eager to participate in the democratic process.
&lt;ref name="accessiblesociety.org" /&gt; Many election officials urge people with disabilities to vote absentee, however some disabled individuals see this as an inferior form of participation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://go.galegroup.com/ps/retrieve.do?inPS=true&amp;prodId=GVRL&amp;userGroupName=txshracd2602&amp;resultListType=RELATED_DOCUMENT&amp;contentSegment=9781412927130&amp;isBOBIndex=true&amp;docId=GALE&amp;#124;CX3469300622#1272|title = Encyclopedia of Disability|date = 2006|access-date = |website = |publisher = SAGE Reference|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Voter turnout is lower among the disabled. In the [[United States presidential election, 2012|2012 United States presidential election]] 56.8% of people with disabilities reported voting, compared to the 62.5% of eligible citizens without disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://smlr.rutgers.edu/disability-and-voting-survey-report-2012-elections|title = Disability and Voting Survey Report 2012 Election|date = |access-date = |website = |publisher = Rutgers University|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Candidacy requirements ==
Jurisprudence concerning candidacy rights and the rights of citizens to create a political party are less clear than voting rights.  Different courts have reached different conclusions regarding what sort of restrictions, often in terms of [[ballot access]], public debate inclusion, filing fees, and residency requirements, may be imposed.

In ''[[Williams v. Rhodes]]'' (1968), the United States Supreme Court struck down [[Ohio]] ballot access laws on First and Fourteenth Amendment grounds.  However, it subsequently upheld such laws in several other cases. States can require an independent or minor party candidate to collect signatures as high as five percent of the total votes cast in a particular preceding election before the court will intervene.

The Supreme Court has also upheld a state ban on cross-party endorsements (also known as [[electoral fusion]]) and primary write-in votes.

== Noncitizen voting ==
{{Main|Right of foreigners to vote in the United States}}

More than 40 states or territories, including colonies before the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]], have at some time allowed noncitizens who satisfied residential requirements to vote in some or all elections. This in part reflected the strong continuing immigration to the United States. Some cities like [[Chicago]], towns or villages (in Maryland) today allow noncitizen residents to vote in school or local elections.&lt;ref name=raskin1993&gt;{{Citation

[[File:Flood Vietnam.jpg|thumb|left|230px|Flood in the streets of [[Can Tho]]]]

The Mekong-Delta covers an area of about 70,000&amp;nbsp;km² in South Vietnam and underlies the influence of the tropical monsoon. The annual dry season lasts from November till April and the rain season from May till October. The river regularly overflows its banks in the lower Mekong area, with beneficial effects, such as the accumulation of fertile sediment. However extreme flood events occur more frequently causing extensive damage. High population density, and farming as a major income source close to flooding endangered areas increase the economic and ecologic impacts of extreme river floods. Beside these extreme floods the Mekong Delta region encounters further challenges and problems, such as  deteriorating water quality due to strong [[pesticide]] use in rice farming areas, unfilteres discharge of rural and industrial waste water, changing climatic conditions with predicted sea level rise, and thereupon resulting salinization and acidification, species / habitats diminish, and regulatory measures ([[hydropower]]) is ongoing at the upper reaches of the Mekong. The interactions between nature and human beings make the Mekong Delta a complex system, requiring a more and more adapted regulation, based on accurate information concerning the different factors entering the equation. Providing information, linking different related scientific domains, designing and implementing decision support technologies accompanied by capacity building measures  is the aim of the WISDOM project serving the integrated water resources management ([[IWRM]]) domain in the Mekong Delta.

== The WISDOM Project Phase II  ==
The first Phase of the WISDOM Project was initiated in August 2007 by the German Ministry of Education and Research ([[BMBF]]) and the Vietnamese Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.most.gov.vn/ MOST website]. Most.gov.vn. Retrieved on 13 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; and lasted for 3 years till 2010. The second Phase of the WISDOM Project lasts from 2010 till 2013. The Project is a German and Vietnamese cooperation, coordinated by the German Aerospace Centre [[German Aerospace Center|(DLR)]] and the Vietnamese Southern Institute of Water Resources Research (SIWRR). It brings together Vietnamese and German partners from different fields, be they scientific, governmental or from the private sector.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wisdom.caf.dlr.de/intro_en.html WISDOM Project website].

===Aims===

The main objective of the project is to collect information on the Mekong Delta from various fields, such as Hydrology, Geography and Earth Observation, Sociology, and to then integrate this information into a single Information System. This allows answers which combine the different factors relevant to the question, for example in case of a flood: How much agricultural land has been affected?

The aim of this Information System is to provide a Decision Support System [[Decision support system|(DSS)]] to the local, regional and national decision makers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://de.sevenload.com/sendungen/Global-3000/folgen/e4uHc9l-Die-naechste-Flut-das-Mekong-Delta-bekommt-ein-Ueberwachungssystem-Video Film by Deutsche Welle TV].

'''WP1000 Project Management and Objectives'''

The main goal of the project coordination is to facilitate administrative coordination, networking and harmonisation of the German contributions with the Vietnamese partners and to ensure the successful completion of the project.

'''WP2000 Water and Knowledge Management''' 
[[Image:Population Pressure.jpg|left|thumb|230px|Rush hour in Can Tho / Vietnam]]
The research and development activities of WP 2000 “Water and knowledge management” are guided by the overall project objective of the second phase which is to implement the WISDOM Information System in Vietnam. The main objectives of the work package are to understand the needs of potential end-users of the Information System, to complete the institutional analysis of the water sector and to build and sustain knowledge management capacity in the Mekong Delta.

'''WP3000 System Design'''

The aim of the system design, development and implementation of a web based integrated water management prototype, developed according to Vietnamese and German user requirements. During a multi-stage developing process evaluation of current prototypes is provided in order to progressively enhance functionality of consecutive systems. Therefore, two prototype systems are developed and deployed at Vietnamese partner institutions thus allowing for thorough system testing and for the implementation and integration of innovations according to altered user requirements.

'''WP4000 Water Resources, River System and Water Related Hazards'''

Quantification of water resources and water quality and the relevant processes is the overall topic of WP4000. Because almost all water related issues in the Mekong Delta as the most downstream and receiving part of the Mekong can hardly be investigated or even solved without taking a look on the processes in the basin, WP4000 extends the general focus of WISDOM to the scale of the whole Mekong basin. In line with the IWRM core aspects “Reassessment of basin hydrology“, “Climate change as an uncertain driver”, “Addressing Urbanization and land-use changes”, and “Recognizing the evolving role of agriculture”. WP4000 starts out with hydrological investigations covering the whole Mekong basin including the impacts of climate change. 
But quantification of water resources is just one side of the IWRM coin: water quality is the other essential aspect. Therefore, WP4000 dedicates approximately half of the work volume to studies investigating water quality issues in the delta. This includes monitoring of the current state of water quality, both by on site observations and remote sensing.

'''WP5000 Water Knowledge and Livelihoods'''

The Work Package 5000 deals with the socio-economic impact of water and resource management in the region. In the work package 5000 methodologies and conceptual frameworks will be developed and adapted to be used to capture vulnerability of people, the economy and environment in its multi-faceted nature. A continuative objective is to understand the diversity of livelihoods and subsistence strategies and how they are shaped by both, environmental and demographic changes and the ongoing political and institutional transformation process.

'''WP6000 Data Integration, Tools and Methodology'''

The activities in of the Work Package address four main questions on how to develop and sustainable implement an Information System for Integrated Water Resources Management. The question, which should be answered is how a sustainable implementation and usage of the WISDOM Information System can be ensured. Secondly a concept for ensuring holistic data management and data sharing has to be developed. Thirdly different thematic, temporal and spatial scales of remote sensing technologies should be analyser towards the use ability to monitor water resources. The last question which should be answered is how information products of the system have to be compiled to ensure the highest degree of user perception and knowledge generation for sustainable decision making.

'''WP7000 Capacity Building'''

The PhD Programme within WISDOM is a cooperation and exchange platform for all PhD researchers working on the project. It is coordinated and managed by UNU-EHS in close collaboration with all partners hosting PhD students. The program aims achieve several results, such as gaining advanced skills in research methodologies and skills necessary for the
interpretation of scientific results, encourage creativity, analytical thinking, critical analysis, and innovative
problem-solving and enhancing cooperation between the WISDOM PhD researchers.

== WISDOM Information System Prototype ==
All results of WISDOM Phase I and Phase II are stored and distributed to WISDOM partners using the WISDOM Information System, which comprises data and information from the fields of hydrology, sociology, information technology, and earth observation. Data models and concepts for storing such kind of data within spatial databases have been developed and implemented in the WISDOM Prototype. Different aspects of data are represented in these models. Ontologies describing spatial-, thematic-, and temporal reference aspects have been implemented allowing a semantic enrichment of the datasets and with that enable fast data retrieval by meaningful search attributes as e.g. finding all data in a specific administrative unit belonging to a specific theme. The models represent geometrical aspects of data and allow for efficient management of either raster- or vector data. Additionally, nonspatial data like sensor measurements or census data are related to the spatial reference objects. The data model further describes styling aspects of spatial datasets using Styled Layer Descriptions as also Web Mapping Service (WMS) layer specifications. This allows for a dynamic retrieval of rendered maps of requested spatial datasets from the data management system. Furthermore, meta data descriptions of spatial data are modelled based on the ISO19115 standard. These are then used in a meta data catalogue system as also in the warehouse of the WISDOM Information System.

The depiction of '''winter landscapes in [[Western art history|Western art]]''' begins in the 15th century. Wintry and snowy landscapes are not seen in early European painting since most of the subjects were religious. Painters avoided landscapes in general for the same reason. The first depictions of snow began to occur in the 15th and 16th centuries.&lt;ref name="Earth Environments p. 863"&gt;''Earth Environments: Past, Present and Future'', by David Huddart &amp; Tim Stott, p. 863 (quoted), 2010, John Wiley &amp; Sons, {{ISBN|9780470749609}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Painting]]s that feature snow as a [[theme (arts)|theme]] are mostly [[landscapes]], even if some of these works involve [[religious]] or even [[fantasy]] landscapes. Most of these winter landscapes in art history are [[plein-air]] depictions of winter scenes, using the quality of gray winter light to create the special winter atmosphere.
Depiction of snow in Europe is essentially a northern European theme.&lt;ref name="Kent 2004"&gt;{{Citation | last = Kent | first = Neil | title = Soul of the North: a Social, Architectural and Cultural History of the Nordic Countries, 1700-1940 | publisher = Reaktion Books | location = London | year = 2004 | isbn = 1-86189-067-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==History==

===Between Renaissance and the eve of Romanticism===
[[File:Les Très Riches Heures du duc de Berry février.jpg|thumb|upright|''February'', attributed to [[Limbourg brothers|Paul Limbourg]], or the "Rustic painter", 1412 and 1416, [[Musée Condé]].]]
Early European painters generally did not depict snow since most of their paintings were of religious subjects. The first artistic representations of snow came in the 15th and 16th centuries.&lt;ref name="Earth Environments p. 863"/&gt; Because frequent snowfall is a part of winter in northern European countries, depiction of snow in Europe began first in the northern European countries.&lt;ref name="Kent 2004"/&gt;

Since the early 15th century, wintry scenes had been represented by artists in parts of large sculptural works on churches and even on a smaller scale in private devotional scripts such as the [[book of hours]], a devotional collection of texts, [[prayer]]s and [[psalm]]s. These were often [[illuminated manuscript]]s such as ''[[Labours of the Months]],'' a cycle of twelve paintings that illustrated the social life, the agricultural tasks, the weather, and the landscape for each month of the year. January and February were typically shown as snowy, as is ''February'' in the famous cycle of the ''[[Les Très Riches Heures du duc de Berry]]'', illustrated 1412–1416. Some snowy scenes also appear in a set of early 14th-century frescoes created by Master Wenceslas for the Bishop's Palace at Trento, showing people throwing snowballs at each other,&lt;ref&gt;Florian Heine, "The First Time: Innovations in Art", Bucher, Munich, 2007 at 33&lt;/ref&gt; and in a detail of [[Ambrogio Lorenzetti]]'s ''Effects of Good Government in the City and Countryside'' (1337–39).&lt;ref&gt;Philip McCouat, "The Emergence of the Winter Landscape", Journal of Art in Society,&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artinsociety.com/the-emergence-of-the-winter-landscape.html|title="The Emergence of the Winter Landscape",|publisher=www.artinsociety.com|accessdate=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bjws.blogspot.se/2014/01/illuminated-manuscript-snow.html|title=illuminated-manuscript-snow|publisher=bjws.blogspot.se|accessdate=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
At that time, landscapes had not yet developed as a genre in art, which explains the scarcity of winter scenes in medieval painting. Snow was not depicted in art except where it had a context, such as in the winter months of calendars.

During the Early [[Northern Renaissance]] and even more during the [[Dutch Golden Age]] in the 17th century, interest in landscape painting was increasing. The winter of 1564–1565 was said to be the longest and most severe for more than a hundred years&amp;nbsp;– the beginning of a cold period in northern Europe now called the [[Little Ice Age]]. For the next 150 years, northern European winters were comparatively snowy and harsh. Crop failures, heavy snowfalls and advancing glaciers that consumed Alpine pastures and villages made the era a grim one for European peasants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/jan/07/brief-history-snow-britain-charlie-english|title=brief-history-snow-britain|publisher=/www.theguardian.com|accessdate=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Pieter Bruegel the Elder - Hunters in the Snow (Winter) - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|275px|left|[[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]], ''[[The Hunters in the Snow]]'', 1565, oil on wood, [[Kunsthistorisches Museum]]]] 
It was early in the frigid winter of 1565 that Bruegel created ''[[The Hunters in the Snow]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/asset-viewer/hunters-in-the-snow-winter/WgFmzFNNN74nUg?projectId=art-project|title=hunters-in-the-snow-winter|publisher=www.google.com|accessdate=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; regarded as the first true winter landscape painting. It was part of a series that illustrated the months, something thematically similar to the traditional Flemish [[book of hours|books of hours]] (e.g. the [[Très Riches Heures du Duc de Berry]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stokstad, Cothren|first=Marilyn, Michael|title=Art History- Fourteenth to Seventeenth Century Art|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the snowy ''Hunters'' (December–January), it included ''[[The Harvesters (painting)|The Harvesters]]'' (August). ''The Hunters'' depicts village life in a snowbound Flemish setting, showing not only hunters with pikes trudging off with their dogs to seek game, but also villagers gathered around a fire, frozen ponds with skaters, and houses and churches in the distance&amp;nbsp;– all against a fanciful backdrop of snow-covered mountains. The series was commissioned in 1565 by a wealthy patron in Antwerp, [[Niclaes Jonghelinck]]. The paintings by Flemish artist [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]] were on a larger scale than calendar paintings; they measured approximately three feet by five feet (0.9 by 1.5 meters).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Foote|first=Timothy|title=The World of Bruegel|year=1968|publisher=Time-Life Library|location=Library of Congress}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bruegel continued to depict snow in his paintings. He created the first nativity scene to include snow, ''[[Adoration of the Magi in a Winter Landscape]]'', which is also the earliest known painting to actually depict falling snow. He also started a vogue for [[Netherlandish]] winter painting. The popularity of landscapes in the Netherlands was in part a reflection of the virtual disappearance of religious painting in a now Protestant (Calvinist) society, which preferred non-religious themes such as [[still life]], [[genre painting]], and landscape painting. The tradition of painting landscapes continued well into the 19th century and developed into the [[Romantic painting|Romantic landscape]]. Between 1780 and 1820, following the initial vogue in the 16th century for Netherlandish winter landscapes, winter subjects again become popular. However, this time winter landscapes became popular in their own right, as the beginning of the Romantic movement created a new interest in the landscape. This new interest, combined with the decline of religious painting in the 18th and 19th centuries all over Europe, gave landscape painting for its own sake, not simply as a backdrop to a scene or a setting, a much greater and more prestigious place in 19th-century art than it had held earlier.&lt;ref name="Earth Environments p. 863"/&gt;

===Romantic landscape painting===
[[File:Caspar David Friedrich - Winterlandschaft (London).jpg|thumbnail|288px| [[Caspar David Friedrich]]: ''Winter Landscape'' (c.&amp;nbsp;1811)]]
Later, after a relatively warm period that coincided with the end of the 17th century [[Dutch Golden Age]], the European climate turned cool again, heading for a trough whose lowest point was in the second decade of the 19th century. In 1809, a series of major volcanic eruptions heralded the arrival of a particularly cold period as the clouds of ash partially blocked out the sun. The decade from 1810 to 1819 was the coldest in England since the 17th century. In 1812, the French [[Grande Armée]] was forced to retreat from Moscow by the advancing winter&amp;nbsp;– known to the Russians as General Snow. These climactic events played a great part in the development of a new art genre, the winter landscape.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/jan/07/brief-history-snow-britain-charlie-english]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 18th century, the growing Romantic movement intensified interest in landscape painting, including winter landscapes. Practitioners included the German artist [[Caspar David Friedrich]], who depicted remote and wild landscapes. Caspar David Friedrich was a romantic landscape painter, and was one of the first artists to portray winter landscapes as austere, forbidding and desolate. His winter scenes are solemn and still. They are often painted [[plein-air]], with the artist using the thin, gray light of winter to create an appropriate atmosphere and illustrate the effect of light reflected off snow. According to the art historian Hermann Beenken, Friedrich painted winter scenes in which "no man has yet set his foot". Although based on direct observation, his landscapes did not reproduce nature but were painted to create a dramatic effect, using nature as a mirror of human emotions. His aim was a reunion with the spiritual self through the contemplation of nature, paralleling Romanticism's validation of intense emotions such as apprehension, fear, horror, terror and awe. Awe in particular&amp;nbsp;– experienced when confronting the [[Sublime (philosophy)|sublimity]] of untamed nature and its picturesque qualities&amp;nbsp;– drew Friedrich's interest, as seen in his idealized portrayals of coasts, forests and craggy mountains. Friedrich created the notion of a landscape full of romantic feeling&amp;nbsp;– ''die romantische Stimmungslandschaft''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Elizabeth Prettejohn|Prettejohn, Elizabeth]] (2005). ''Beauty &amp; Art, 1750–2000''.

Along with other Romantic painters, Friedrich helped position [[landscape painting]] as a major genre within Western art. His style influenced his contemporary, the Norwegian [[Johan Christian Dahl]] (1788–1857), and, later, [[Arnold Böcklin]] (1827–1901) and many Russian painters, in particular [[Arkhip Kuindzhi]] (c. 1842–1910) and [[Ivan Shishkin]] (1832–98).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Epstein|first=Suzanne Latt|title=The Relationship of the American Luminists to Caspar David Friedrich|publisher=Columbia University|location=New York|year=1964|oclc=23758262}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The work of the 18th-century [[Düsseldorf School]] is characterized by finely detailed but still fanciful landscapes, often portraying religious or allegorical stories. Leading members of the Düsseldorf School advocated [[En plein air|plein-air]] painting and tended to use a [[Palette (painting)|palette]] of relatively subdued and muted colors. The Düsseldorf School grew out of, and was a part of, the [[Germany|German]] [[Romantic movement]]. Prominent members of the Düsselorf School included [[Friedrich Wilhelm Schadow]], [[Rudolf Koller]], [[Karl Friedrich Lessing]], [[Johann Wilhelm Schirmer]], [[Andreas Achenbach]], [[Hans Fredrik Gude]], [[Oswald Achenbach]] and [[Adolf Schrödter]].&lt;ref name="humboldt"&gt;{{cite book|last=Humboldt|first=Wilhelm von|title=Gesammelte Schriften. 1.

French painters were slower to develop landscape painting, but from about the 1830s [[Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot]] and other artists of the [[Barbizon School]] established a French landscape tradition that in the 19th century would become the most influential in Europe.

It is often assumed that [[plein-air]] painting started with the 19th-century [[Impressionism|Impressionists]], but in fact it was already common in the late 18th century when the members of the [[Hudson River School]] of American [[landscape art|landscape]] painters were already painting in plein-air.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jamesgurney.com/interview.html|title=interview|publisher=jamesgurney.com|accessdate=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[I really like the work before 1860 the best. People often assume that plein-air painting started with the Impressionists, but it's much older than that, going back to the late 18th Century. The Hudson River School painters, under the influence of Asher B. Durand, were the first to make a regular practice of it, and they often made more sensitive observations than later plein-air painters, because they weren't influenced by the notion of "art for art's sake." Art does not exist for its own sake. The purpose of art is not to make an aesthetically pleasing picture; it should be much more—to tell a story, reveal a character, convey an emotion, or express some truth about nature.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://art-landscape.blogspot.se/2010/05/what-is-plein-air-painting.html|title=plein-air-painting|publisher=art-landscape.blogspot.se|accessdate=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Frederic Edwin Church]], a central figure in the [[Hudson River School]], was known for painting large landscapes that he saw during his travels to the Arctic and Central and South America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://issuu.com/dallasmuseumofart/docs/dma_voyageoftheicebergs|title=Voyage of the Icebergs -online book|publisher=/issuu.com/dallasmuseumofart|accessdate=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;''Plein-air painting, in its strictest sense, is the practice of painting landscape pictures out-of-doors; more loosely, the achievement of an intense impression of the open air (French: plein air) in a landscape painting. Until the time of the painters of the Barbizon school in mid-19th-century France, it was normal practice to execute rough sketches of landscape subjects in the open air and produce finished paintings in the studio. Part of this was a matter of convenience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://global.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/464567/plein-air-painting|title=plein-air-painting|publisher=global.britannica.com|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Impressionists were the first artists who made plein-air painting a major genre. They painted outdoors and were interested in real-life subject matter. Their most evident preoccupation and interest was capturing the effect of light and weather at a particular moment&amp;nbsp;– they often painted the same theme all over again in different light and different weather. The Impressionists were influenced in many of their subjects by [[Japanese woodblock prints]]. The themes of falling snow and figures with umbrellas in snow are frequent subjects in the [[ukiyo-e]] Japanese woodblock prints.&lt;ref name="www.mfa.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mfa.org/collections/object/boulevard-saint-denis-argenteuil-in-winter-34290|title=boulevard-saint-denis-argenteuil-in-winter|publisher=www.mfa.org|accessdate=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://culturevulture.net/art-architecture/impressionists-in-winter/|title=impressionists-in-winter|publisher=culturevulture.net|accessdate=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecultureconcept.com/circle/monets-garden-melbourne-winter-masterpieces-exhibition|title=Monet’s Garden – Melbourne Winter Masterpieces Exhibition|publisher=www.thecultureconcept.com|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[During the latter half of the nineteenth century (1874 – 1886) many people found it difficult to cope with this new vision. It was all about capturing the moment, the joy of life and revealing many of its secrets or truths.]&lt;/ref&gt;

It is possible that a series of severe winters in France also contributed to an increase in the number of winter landscapes produced by Impressionists.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rathbone|1999|p=22}}; {{harvnb|Sweeney|1999|pp=23–27}}; For the range of 63 major works produced from 1867–1893, see Moffett et al. 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Impressionist painters like [[Claude Monet]], [[Alfred Sisley]] and [[Camille Pissarro]] started painting large numbers of winter landscapes in which they experimented with the use of light and color to paint what they called the ''effets de neige'' (the effects of snow). Other painters who painted winter landscapes but less frequently were [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]], [[Gustave Caillebotte]] and [[Paul Gauguin]]. The French master [[Claude Monet]]'s first painting in his winter series of 140 paintings was ''A Cart on the Snowy Road at [[Honfleur]]'', which was followed by many other winter landscapes, including a long series with haystacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://entertainment.howstuffworks.com/arts/artwork/claude-monet-paintings-1889-18948.htm|title=claude-monet-paintings-1889|publisher=entertainment.howstuffworks.com|accessdate=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the painting ''Boulevard Saint Denis'', Monet sought to catch the moment when the sun was hidden behind the clouds during a light snowfall.&lt;ref name="www.mfa.org"/&gt; In ''[[The Magpie (Monet)|The Magpie]]'', Monet's largest and probably most widely known winter painting, he used blue-gray colors to depict shadows in the snow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.claude-monet.com/the-magpie.jsp|title=the-magpie|publisher=www.claude-monet.com|accessdate=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zucapaca.com/best-of-monet/claude-monet-1868-1869-the-magpie/|title=claude-monet-1868-1869-the-magpie|publisher=www.zucapaca.com|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was the natural outdoor light that made the Impressionist's treatment of subjects different. They closely observed the various colors of light that were reflected from objects and captured those colors in their paintings. Since Impressionists painted in ''[[plein air]]'', the shadows reflected the light of the sky as it was reflected onto surfaces.

Impressionists generally used vivid colors, with often thick application of paint, and real-life subject matter. The new technology of premixed paints in tin tubes aided the development of this style.&lt;ref&gt;http://yalepress.yale.edu/yupbooks/book.asp?isbn=0300050356&lt;/ref&gt; Previously, painters had made their own paints by grinding and mixing dry pigment powders with linseed oil.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.phillipscollection.org/docs/education/lbp-kit_4.pdf Renoir and the Impressionist Process]. ''[[The Phillips Collection]]'', 2014&lt;/ref&gt; 
In the 1860s, many vivid synthetic pigments became commercially available such as [[cobalt blue]], [[viridian]], [[cadmium yellow]] and synthetic [[ultramarine blue]], as well as even newer colors such as [[cerulean blue]].&lt;ref name="Wallert_159"&gt;Wallert, Arie; Hermens, Erma; Peek, Marja (1995).

As a result, the Impressionists soon moved toward a brighter style of painting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Stoner, J.H. |author2=Rushfield, R. |year=2013 |title=Conservation of Easel Paintings |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis  |isbn=9781136000416 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1msM3h9mbaoC |page=177}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1870s, [[Monet]], [[Renoir]], and [[Pissarro]] usually chose to paint on grounds of a light grey or beige colour, but some of the Impressionists had come to prefer white grounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yalepress.yale.edu/yupbooks/book.asp?isbn=0300050356|title=Impressionists|publisher=/yalepress.yale.edu|accessdate=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Wonders of the East''' or ''The Marvels of the East'' is an [[Old English]] prose piece, written around AD 1000. It describes a variety of odd, magical and barbaric creatures that inhabit Eastern regions, such as [[Babylon]], [[Persia]], [[Egypt]], and [[India]]. ''The Wonders'' can be found in three extant manuscripts from the 11th and 12th centuries.

==Contents==

Amongst the wonders described are huge dragons who prevent travel, phoenixes  born from ashes, and hens in Lentibelsinea who burn peoples’ bodies when they are touched. ''The Wonders of the East'' also tells of incredible scenarios, like how to steal gold from giant ants. Fantastical and barbaric people are also mentioned, for example, the ''Donestre'' race of cannibals, the ''Homodubii'' half human and half donkey creatures, and the ''[[panotti]]'', with their fan-like ears, which they sleep on and with which they cover themselves. ''The Wonders of the East'' is an Anglo-Saxon contribution to the ''mirabilia'' genre, "literature in which a traveler in foreign lands describes exotic sights in a letter home.” &lt;ref&gt;Jones 494&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, ''The Wonders of the East'' demonstrates the “mutual mistrust” between men and monsters because the creatures either flee from humans, harm those that come near them, or eat people.&lt;ref&gt;Orchard, ''Pride and Prodigies'' 27&lt;/ref&gt;

==Manuscript versions==
''The Wonders of the East'' is found in three manuscripts. It is in the [[Beowulf]] manuscript (also known as the [[Nowell Codex]], London, British Library, Cotton Vitellius A. xv).&lt;ref&gt;Orchard, ''Pride and Prodigies'' 1&lt;/ref&gt; It is written in Late West Saxon &lt;ref&gt;Sisam 73&lt;/ref&gt; in a Mercian dialect.&lt;ref&gt;Sisam 94&lt;/ref&gt; Other than ''[[Beowulf]]'' and ''The Wonders of the East'', the other works in this codex include: ''The Passion of St. Christopher'', ''[[The Letter of Alexander to Aristotle]]'', and ''[[Judith]]''. One scribe is believed to have copied ''The Passion of St. Christopher'', ''The Letter of Alexander to Aristotle'', ''The Wonders of the East'', and first part of ''Beowulf'', and another scribe wrote the remainder of ''Beowulf'' and ''Judith''. This codex was most likely compiled by Sir [[Sir Robert Cotton, 1st Baronet, of Connington|Robert Cotton]], who possessed many Old English manuscripts. In 1731 the [[Cotton Library]], which housed this manuscript, caught on fire; therefore, the text almost did not survive and is slightly burned around the edges. The codex may have been intentionally put together because four of the manuscripts discuss monsters. Furthermore, it is a “''liber monstrorum'', or book of marvels, designed for entertainment along with usual edification.&lt;ref&gt;Wrenn 254&lt;/ref&gt; The date of this manuscript is usually believed to be “within a couple of decades of A.D. 1000,” &lt;ref&gt;Baker 122&lt;/ref&gt; no earlier than AD 997 and no later than AD 1016. 

Furthermore, ''The Wonders of the East'' is also preserved in the [[Cotton Tiberius]] B.v, in both Latin and Old English, which was written down around AD 1050. In addition, it appears in the [[Oxford Bodleian Library]], Bodleian 614 manuscript in [[Latin]], which is from the “early twelfth century.” &lt;ref name="Friedman 144"&gt;Friedman 144&lt;/ref&gt; The three manuscripts each differ in text and focus, but “all the [[Old English language|Anglo-Saxon]] versions derive ultimately from a continental group of Latin texts, almost all of which share a basic epistolary framework entirely lacking in the Anglo-Saxon versions, and in which a variously-named traveler reports back to his emperor.” &lt;ref&gt;Orchard, “Marvels of the East” 304&lt;/ref&gt; More specifically, ''The Wonders of the East'' is initially from Greek origin. It was then “taken from a Latin collection of Mirabilia” (Wrenn 253). Furthermore, Alexander’s Letter to Aristotle, also in the Nowell Codex, shares similar subject matter with ''The Wonders of the East'' and probably has a similar origin. The Anglo-Saxon ''Wonders of the East'' exists in many manuscripts with a similar epistolary structure, “in which either a character variously named Feramen, Feramus, or Fermes writes to the [[Emperor Hadrian]] (A.D. 117-38), or a figure called Premo, Premonis, Perimenis, or Parmoenis writes to Hadrian’s predecessor, the Emperor Trajan (A.D 98-116), to report on the many marvels he has witnessed on his travels.” &lt;ref&gt;Orchard, ''Pride and Prodigies'' 23&lt;/ref&gt; 

All three manuscripts are illustrated with fairly simple pictures.  The Tiberius manuscript most intricately illustrates the 37 marvels described in both Latin and Old English.  The Bodleian 614 manuscript, only in Latin, depicts 49 wonders. Lastly, the Nowell Codex, in Old English, contains only 32 images. The images parallel the text, and provide a picture of the described creatures. ''The Wonders of the East'' may be considered a pseudo-scientific text because of the illustrations. Therefore, the images are “possibly intended to lend a note of authority by making specific plants, animals, or monsters easier to recognize.” &lt;ref&gt;Karkov 80&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the images are simple and have one or two figures in each illustration. More specifically, “One of the most important characteristics of... their illustrations is that the races are seen in some sort of relationship to the viewer, rather than in isolation of an empty frame.” &lt;ref name="Friedman 144"/&gt;

The '''Zionist Congress''' was established in 1897 by [[Theodor Herzl]] as the supreme organ of the [[World Zionist Organization|Zionist Organization]] (ZO) and its legislative authority. In 1960 the names were changed to '''World Zionist Congress''' ({{lang-he|הקונגרס הציוני העולמי}} ''HaKongres HaTsioni HaOlami'') and World Zionist Organization (WZO), respectively. The World Zionist Organization elects the officers and decides on the policies of the WZO and the [[Jewish Agency]].&lt;ref name=wzo&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wzo.org.il/Zionist-Congress |title=Zionist Congress |publisher=World Zionist Organization |accessdate=21 Feb 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JVL"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/world-zionist-organization-wzo |title=Zionism: World Zionist Organization (WZO) |publisher=American-Israeli Cooperative Enterprise |accessdate=11 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first Zionist Congress was held in [[Basel]], Switzerland in 1897.&lt;ref name="JVL"/&gt;

Any Jew over age 18 who belongs to a [[Zionist]] association is eligible to vote, and the number of elected delegates to the Congress is 500.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jewishagency.org/NR/rdonlyres/056BA126-0B81-48C2-8994-93D1021ECED3/15904/rules.doc |format=Microsoft Word doc |title=Rules for the Election of Delegates to the Zionist Congress |origyear=1976 |date=June 2004 |publisher=World Zionist Organization |accessdate=16 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=usvote&gt;http://www.myselfourisrael.com&lt;/ref&gt; 38% of the delegates are allocated to Israel, 29% to the United States of America, and 33% to the remainder of the countries of the Diaspora.&lt;ref name=wzo/&gt; In addition there are about 100 delegates which are appointed by International Organizations (e.g. B'nai B'rith, see below) affiliated with WZO.&lt;ref name=usvote /&gt;

After the [[First Zionist Congress]] in 1897, the Zionist Congress met every year until 1901, then every second year from 1903 to 1913 and 1921 to 1939. Until 1946, the Congress was held every two years in various European cities, save for interruptions during the two World Wars. Their goal was to build an infrastructure to further the cause of Jewish settlement in Palestine. Since the Second World War, meetings have been held approximately every four years.

The upcoming 38th World Zionist Congress will take place in 2020.

==Representatives at the World Zionist Congress==
The World Zionist Congress includes representatives of [[#Zionist World Unions|Zionist World Unions]], Women's [[#Zionist Organizations with Special Status|Zionist Organizations with Special Status]] and [[#International Jewish Organizations|International Jewish Organizations]].&lt;ref name=wzo /&gt;

===Zionist World Unions===
Zionist participants in the World Zionist Congress are free to form ''Brit Olamit'' or Zionist World Unions (ideological groupings), which are somewhat like [[political party|political parties]]. While Israeli political parties can participate in the Congress, ''brits'' are also organized and voted into the Congress by non-Israelis, making the Congress a multinational deliberative body for the Jewish diaspora. However, as ''[[aliyah]]'' has brought Jews to Israel from other countries, Israeli representation in the legislature has increased at the expense of non-Israeli Jewish diaspora representation. A Brit Olamit (World Union) must have representation in at least five countries to send a delegation to the Congress.

There are currently six Zionist World Unions (with full voting rights):

* World Zionist Union: [[Labor Zionist]] Movement – [[Arzenu]] – World Union of [[Meretz]]
* United Faction: [[Kadima]]–[[HaNoar HaTzioni]]– [[MERCAZ]]
* World [[Mizrachi (religious Zionism)|Mizrachi]]/[[Ichud Le'umi]]/[[Herut]]/[[Yisrael Beytenu]]/[[Moledet]]/[[Tkuma (political party)|Tkuma]]
* World [[Likud]]/[[Shas]]
* [[Hadassah]]/Confederation
* [[Tzvi Avisar|Over The rainbow]] – the Zionist movement

===Zionist organizations with special status===
Two women's organizations have special status in the Zionist Organization and have full voting rights:

* [[WIZO]] – is an international, non-party Zionist body, which receives global representation by virtue of an agreement entered into in 1964. 
* [[Hadassah]] – received special status by virtue of a decision of the Zionist General Council, in 1994.&lt;ref name=wzo /&gt; (duplicate?)

===International Jewish organizations===
The international Jewish organizations have also been represented in the Zionist Congress since 1972, provided that they accept the [[Jerusalem Program]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.myselfourisrael.com/faqs/#jerusalem_program&lt;/ref&gt; even if not all their members are declared Zionists. These bodies have limited voting rights{{snd}} they do not vote on matters of candidature and elections to the institutions of the WZO.&lt;ref name=wzo /&gt;

The following are the International Jewish Organizations (limited voting rights):
* [[Bnai Brith]] International
* [[Maccabi World Union]]
* [[Na'amat]]
* [[WIZO]] Women's International Zionist Organization (duplicate?)
* [[World Council of Conservative Masorti Synagogues]]
* [[World Emunah]]
* [[World Organization of Orthodox Synagogues &amp; Communities in Israel and the Diaspora]]
* [[American Sephardi Federation|World Sephardi Federation]]
* [[World Union for Progressive Judaism]]
* [[World Union of Jewish Students]]
* [[Zionist Council in Israel]]

===Other participants in Congress (advisors, observers)===
* In addition to the delegates with full voting rights participating in Congress, there are also participants in an advisory capacity which can participate in debates but have no voting rights. These may consist of office holders such as members of the Zionist Executive, members of the Zionist General Council who were not elected as delegates to Congress, Chairs of the Zionist Federations, judicial office holders - the President of the Zionist Supreme Court, the Attorney, the Comptroller and representatives of the Aliyah Movement.&lt;ref name=wzo /&gt;
* Observers with no speaking or voting rights can be invited by the Zionist Executive or the Congress Presidium.

==The course of the Congress==
The Zionist Congress is conducted by the Congress Presidium. Congress deliberations are divided into five stages:&lt;ref name=wzo /&gt;
* Opening of the Congress, including a speech by the Chairman of the Executive, and other speeches determined in the agenda, election of the Congress Presidium, the report of the President of the Zionist Supreme Court on the election results, reports of the members of the Zionist Executive in supplement to the printed report, election of the Congress committees.

===Important moments===
* The [[First Zionist Congress]], held in 1897 in Basel, Switzerland, had Theodor Herzl acting as chairperson. The Congress was attended by some 200 participants who formulated the Zionist platform, known as the "Basel programme", and established the Zionist Organization (ZO). In contrast with the older Hibbat Zion movement, the ZO took a clear stance in favour of political Zionism, stating in its programme that
:"Zionism seeks for the Jewish people a publicly recognized legally secured homeland in Palestine."
Herzl wrote in his diary,
:"Were I to sum up the Basel Congress in a word - which I shall guard against pronouncing publicly - it would be this: At Basel I founded the Jewish State."&lt;ref name="1to12"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Zionism/firstcong.html |title=Zionist Congress: First to Twelfth Zionist Congress (1897 - 1921) |publisher=Jewish Virtual Library |accessdate=20 March 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The Twenty-third Zionist Congress, held in 1951 in  Jerusalem, Israel, was the first to be held after the establishment of the State of Israel, and the first held in Jerusalem, which would become the norm. It was opened at the graveside of Theodor Herzl, whose remains had been moved from Vienna and reburied on the top of a hill in Jerusalem that was renamed after him, [[Mount Herzl]]. The Congress issued the "Jerusalem Program", placing its main focus on the newly created state as the central unifying element for the Jewish people.&lt;ref name="Israel1001"/&gt;

* [[Ruth Popkin]] was the first woman to be Chair of the Presidium and President of the World Zionist Congress, being elected to both positions in 1987.&lt;ref name="jewishjournal1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Tigay |first=Alan |url= http://www.jewishjournal.com/obituaries/article/ruth_popkin_hadassah_past_national_president_dies_at_101 |title=Ruth Popkin, Hadassah past national president, dies at 101 &amp;#124; Obituaries |publisher=Jewish Journal |date=2015-01-05 |accessdate=2015-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
