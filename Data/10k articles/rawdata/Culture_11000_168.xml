An '''adornment''' is generally an accessory or ornament worn to enhance the [[beauty]] or status of the wearer. They are often worn to embellish, enhance, or distinguish the wearer, and to define cultural, social, or religious status within a specific community. When worn to show economic status, the items are often either rare or prohibitively expensive to others. Adornments are usually colourful, and worn to attract attention.

They have a long history, around the world, from feathers or bone, to modern accessories, such as [[jewellery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.transoxiana.org/0110/neva-jewelry.html |title=Types and Forms of Ancient Jewelry from Central Asia - Neva - Transoxiana 10 |publisher=Transoxiana.org |date= |accessdate=2010-07-30| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100721172044/http://www.transoxiana.org/0110/neva-jewelry.html| archivedate= 21 July 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Items of adornment are also used by warriors, and by other members of the military to show rank or achievement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://areainfo.asafas.kyoto-u.ac.jp/english/areainfo/adornments_e.html |title=Adornments of the Samburu in Northern Kenya: A Comprehensive List 21COE |publisher=Areainfo.asafas.kyoto-u.ac.jp |date= |accessdate=2010-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Items of adornment==
These include [[cosmetics]], [[jewellery]], clothing accessories, facial hair, fingernail modification, [[piercing]], lip plates, [[tattoo]]ing, braiding, and [[head gear]].

==Cultures, subcultures, and institutions==
Groups who practice adornment include the [[Yakuza]], [[military]], [[religion|religious]] institutions, [[tribe|tribal]] groups, and the [[punk culture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1336/0313336954 |title=Greenwood Publishing Group}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Items of adornment can tell us about a person's rank, social status, gender role, area of origin, etc. An example would be the beaded jewelry worn by the [[Maasai people|Maasai]] tribe, which is very specific to them and some related tribes.

{{About|fictional air piracy|real life air piracy|Aircraft hijacking}}
'''Air pirates''' (also known as '''sky pirates''') are a type of [[stock character]] from [[science fiction]] and [[fantasy]].

==Description==
Fictional air pirates typically operate as [[piracy|pirates]] in the [[Atmosphere of Earth|air]], or, in general, the [[atmosphere]] of a planet, [[dwarf planet]] or moon, and travel by [[aircraft]], as opposed to the more traditional pirates on the high seas, who travel by [[ship]]. However, just as traditional seafaring pirates target sailing ships, air pirates serve a similar role in science fiction and fantasy media: they capture and plunder aircraft and other targets for cargo, loot and occasionally they steal an entire aircraft, sometimes killing the crewmembers in the process. However, their dress and speech may vary; it may correspond to the particular author's vision of the story's setting, rather than their seafaring counterparts.

==In reality==
In real-life use, the phrase "[[air piracy]]" more often refers to the hijacking and illegal seizure of an aircraft. However, there has been at least one occasion of an act of nautical-type piracy being conducted from the air. This occurred in 1917, when the civilian Norwegian schooner ''Royal'' was boarded and captured by a boarding party from the German [[Zeppelin]] [[List of Zeppelins#Zeppelins constructed during World War I|L23]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Zeppelin in Combat: A History of the German Naval Airship Division, 1912-1918|first=Douglas Hill|last=Robinson|date=1962|location=London|publisher=G.T.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3014">An '''anti-suicide smock''', '''Ferguson''', '''turtle suit''', '''Bam Bam suit''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apltwo.ct.state.az.us/Decisions/JV20060049Opinion.pdf |title=APPEAL FROM THE SUPERIOR COURT OF PINAL COUNTY Cause No. JV-200300627 |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2012-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; or '''suicide gown''', is a tear-resistant single-piece outer garment that is generally used to prevent a [[hospital]]ized, [[incarcerated]], or otherwise detained individual from forming a [[noose]] with the garment to commit [[suicide]]. The smock is typically a simple, sturdily [[quilted]], collarless, sleeveless [[gown]] with adjustable openings at the shoulders and down the front that are closed with [[nylon]] [[hook-and-loop]] or similar fasteners. The thickness of the garment makes it impossible to roll or fold the garment so it can be used as a noose.  It is not a restraint and provides modesty and warmth while not impeding the mobility of the wearer. The suit covers all private areas as the wearer is to be naked under the suit for their own protection. 

These items are formally known as Safety Smocks and were designed and developed by Lonna Speer in 1989 while she was a nurse working in the Santa Cruz, California, county jail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.PreventSuicide.com/aboutus.htm |title=Ferguson Safety Products: About Us |publisher=Preventsuicide.com |date= |accessdate=2012-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Safety Smocks are now standard issue throughout jails and prisons in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.securingcosmos.com/shopexd.asp?id=3494|title=Safety Suicide Smock.|date=September 2007|accessdate=September 4, 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070929143356/http://www.securingcosmos.com/shopexd.asp?id=3494| archivedate= 29 September 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same material is used for the [[anti-suicide blanket]].  Prior to use of the Safety Smock many jails and prisons stripped inmates naked and held them in a stripped down padded cell with no furniture or protrusions of any kind.  Some facilities opted to use paper gowns to provide modesty. However, inmates are able to fashion a noose from a paper gown in less than 15 seconds, so most institutions no longer use them.  The American Correctional Association (ACA) has established use of appropriate Safety Smocks and Safety Blankets as one of the Standards used to judge jails and prisons for accreditation.  Demand for Safety Smocks to meet this ACA Standard led to multiple clothing makers creating similar garments of varying strength and of various materials. In addition to the Safety Smock, Lonna Speer developed the Safety Blanket and the Safe Sleeping Bag, all made from the quilted heavy nylon material, as well as The Dozer, a Suicide Cell mattress, the Safety Pillow, and Safety Slippers.

'''Asa Koma''' ("Red Hill") is an [[archaeological site]] in [[Djibouti]].

==Overview==
Asa Koma is an inland lake area on the Gobaad Plain. Pottery predating the mid-2nd millennium BC has been found at the site.{{When|date=July 2016}} The ware is characterized by punctate and incision geometric designs, which bear a similarity to the Sabir culture phase 1 ceramics from Ma'layba in [[Southern Arabia]].&lt;ref name="Ohvah"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Walter Raunig|first1=Steffen Wenig|title=Afrikas Horn|date=2005|publisher=Otto Harrassowitz Verlag|isbn=3447051752|page=439|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=JpNY7VPn1WUC|accessdate=7 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, ceramics like some of the pottery from Sihi on the Saudi coast and Subr on the Yemeni littoral have been found here.&lt;ref name="Iuoni"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Istituto universitario orientale (Naples, Italy)|title=Annali, Volume 58|date=1998|publisher=Edizione universitarie|page=527|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=zNtiAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=15 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Long-horned humpless cattle bones have also been discovered at Asa Koma, suggesting that domesticated cattle was present by around 3,500 years ago.&lt;ref name="Connah"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Connah|first1=Graham|title=Forgotten Africa: An Introduction to Its Archaeology|date=2004|publisher=Routledge|isbn=1134403038|page=46|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=ggD1wdQxBOcC|accessdate=7 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder''' ('''ARFID'''), previously known as '''selective eating disorder''' ('''SED'''), is a type of [[eating disorder]], where certain foods are limited based on appearance, smell, taste, texture, brand, presentation, or a past negative experience with the food.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fisher|first=Martin M.|last2=Rosen|first2=David S.|last3=Ornstein|first3=Rollyn M.|last4=Mammel|first4=Kathleen A.|last5=Katzman|first5=Debra K.|last6=Rome|first6=Ellen S.|last7=Callahan|first7=S.

== Signs and symptoms ==
People with ARFID have an inability to eat certain foods. "Safe" foods may be limited to certain food types and even specific brands.  In some cases, individuals with the condition will exclude whole food groups, such as fruits or vegetables. Sometimes excluded foods can be refused based on color. Some may only like very hot or very cold foods, very crunchy or hard-to-chew foods, or very soft foods, or avoid sauces.

Most people with ARFID will still maintain a healthy or typical body weight.  There are no specific outward appearances associated with ARFID.&lt;ref name="nicholls"&gt;Nicholls, D., Christie, D., Randall, L. and Lask, B.. (2001). "Selective Eating: Symptom, Disorder or Normal Variant." Clinical Child Psychology and Psychiatry. Vol 6(2): 257–270.&lt;/ref&gt; Sufferers can experience physical [[gastrointestinal]] reactions to adverse foods such as retching, vomiting or gagging. Some studies have identified symptoms of social avoidance due to their eating habits. Most, however, would change their eating habits if they could.&lt;ref name="nicholls" /&gt;

===Associated conditions===
The determination of the cause of ARFID has been difficult due to the lack of diagnostic criteria and concrete definition. However, many have proposed other conditions that co-occur with ARFID.

There are different kinds of 'sub-categories' identified for ARFID:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Sensory-based avoidance, where the individual refuses food intake based on smell, texture, color, brand, presentation
* A lack of interest in consuming the food, or tolerating it nearby
* Food being associated with fear-evoking stimuli that have developed through a learned history

=== Autism ===
Symptoms of ARFID are usually found with symptoms of other disorders. Some form of feeding disorder is found in 80% of children that also have a developmental disability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chatoor | first1 = I. | last2 = Hamburger | first2 = E. | last3 = Fullard | first3 = R. | last4 = Fivera | first4 = Y. | year = 1994 | title = A survey of picky eating and pica behaviors in toddlers | url = | journal = Scientific Proceedings of the Annual Meeting of American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry | volume = 10 | issue = | page = 50 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Children often exhibit symptoms of [[obsessive-compulsive disorder]] and [[autism]]. Although many people with ARFID have symptoms of these disorders, they usually do not qualify for a full diagnosis. Strict behavior patterns and difficulty adjusting to new things are common symptoms in patients that are on the [[Autism Spectrum Disorder|autistic spectrum]].&lt;ref name="nicholls" /&gt; A study done by Schreck at [[Pennsylvania State University]] compared the eating habits of children with [[Autism Spectrum Disorder|ASD]] and typically developing children. After analyzing their eating patterns, they suggested that the children with some degree of ASD have a higher degree of selective eating. These children were found to have similar patterns of selective eating and favored more energy dense foods such as nuts and whole grains. Eating a diet of energy dense foods could put these children at a greater risk for health problems such as obesity and other chronic diseases due to the high fat and low fiber content of energy dense foods. Due to the tie to ASD, children are less likely to outgrow their selective eating behaviors and most likely should meet with a clinician to address their eating issues.&lt;ref&gt;Schreck KA, Williams K, Smith AF. A comparison of eating behaviors between children with and without Autism" ''Journal of Autism and Developmental Disabilities'' 2004; 34: 433-438.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Evans, E. (2013). Selective Eating and Autism Spectrum Disorder. In Behavioral Health Nutrition. Retrieved April 2, 2013, from {{cite web|url=http://www.bhndpg.org/students/selective.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-04-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130719051112/http://www.bhndpg.org/students/selective.asp |archivedate=2013-07-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Anxiety disorder ===
Specific food avoidances could be caused by food phobias that cause great [[anxiety]] when a person is presented with new or feared foods. Most eating disorders are related to a fear of gaining weight. Those who have ARFID do not have this fear, but the psychological symptoms and anxiety created is similar.&lt;ref name="nicholls" /&gt; Some people with ARFID have fears such as [[emetophobia]] (fear of vomiting) or a fear of choking, but this is not common.

== Diagnosis ==
Diagnosis is often based on a diagnostic checklist to test whether an individual is exhibiting certain behaviors and characteristics. Clinicians will look at the variety of foods an individual consumes, as well as the portion size of accepted foods. They will also question how long the avoidance or refusal of particular foods has lasted, and if there are any associated medical concerns, such as malnutrition.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Unlike most eating disorders, there may be a higher rate of ARFID in young boys than there is in young girls.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.anad.org/get-information/about-eating-disorders/eating-disorders-statistics/|title=Eating Disorder Statistics • National Association of Anorexia Nervosa and Associated Disorders|work=National Association of Anorexia Nervosa and Associated Disorders|access-date=2017-12-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Criteria ===
The fifth edition of the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' ([[DSM-5]]) renamed "Feeding Disorder of Infancy or Early Childhood" to Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder, and broadened the diagnostic criteria. Previously defined as a disorder exclusive to children and adolescents, the DSM-5 broadened the disorder to include adults who limit their eating and are affected by related physiological or psychological problems, but who do not fall under the definition of another eating disorder.

The DSM-5 defines the following diagnostic criteria:&lt;ref&gt;American Psychiatric Association. (2013). Highlights of Changes from DSM-IV-TR to DSM-5. Retrieved May 14, 2014, from {{cite web|url=http://www.dsm5.org/Documents/changes%20from%20dsm-iv-tr%20to%20dsm-5.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-10-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019204551/http://www.dsm5.org/Documents/changes%20from%20dsm-iv-tr%20to%20dsm-5.pdf |archivedate=2013-10-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Disturbance in eating or feeding, as evidenced by one or more of:
** Substantial weight loss (or, in children, absence of expected weight gain)
** Nutritional deficiency
** Dependence on a [[feeding tube]] or [[dietary supplements]]
** Significant [[psychosocial]] interference
* Disturbance not due to unavailability of food, or to observation of cultural norms
* Disturbance not due to [[anorexia nervosa]] or [[bulimia nervosa]], and no evidence of disturbance in experience of body shape or weight
* Disturbance not better explained by another medical condition or mental disorder, or when occurring concurrently with another condition, the disturbance exceeds what is normally caused by that condition
In previous years, the DSM was not inclusive in recognizing all of the challenges associated with feeding and eating disorders in 3 main domains:&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bryant-Waugh|first=R|year=2013|title=Avoidant restrictive food intake disorder: An illustrative case example|url=|journal=International Journal of Eating Disorders|volume=46|pages=420–423|via=|doi=10.1002/eat.22093}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Eating Disorders Not Otherwise Specified (EDNOS) was an all-inclusive, placeholder group for all individuals that presented challenges with feeding
* The category of Feeding Disorder of Infancy/ Early Childhood was noted to be too broad, limiting specification when treating these behaviors
* There are children and youth who present feeding challenges but do not fit within any existing categories to date

Children are often picky eaters, this does not necessarily mean they meet the criteria for an ARFID diagnosis. In addition, self-identification as having ARFID may contribute to the condition.

== Treatment ==

=== For adults ===
With time the symptoms of ARFID can lessen and can eventually disappear without treatment. However, in some cases treatment will be needed as the symptoms persist into adulthood. The most common type of treatment for ARFID is some form of [[cognitive-behavioral therapy]]. Working with a clinician can help to change behaviors more quickly than symptoms may typically disappear without treatment.&lt;ref name="nicholls" /&gt; 

There are support groups for adults with ARFID.&lt;ref name="wang"&gt;Wang, S. (2010, July 5). No Age Limit on Picky Eating. Wall Street Journal. Retrieved April 2, 2013, from https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704699604575343130457388718&lt;/ref&gt;

=== For children ===
Children can benefit from a four stage in-home treatment program based on the principles of [[systematic desensitization]]. The four stages of the treatment are record, reward, relax and review.&lt;ref name="nicholls" /&gt;

* In the record stage, children are encouraged to keep a log of their typical eating behaviors without attempting to change their habits as well as their [[cognitive]] feelings.
* The reward stage involves systematic desensitization. Children create a list of foods that they might like to try eating some day. These foods may not be drastically different from their normal diet, but perhaps a familiar food prepared in a different way. Because the goal is for the children to try new foods, children are rewarded when they sample new foods.
*The relaxation stage is most important for those children that suffer severe anxiety when presented with unfavorable foods. Children learn to relax to reduce the anxiety that they feel. Children work through a list of anxiety-producing stimuli and can create a story line with relaxing imagery and scenarios. Often these stories can also include the introduction of new foods with the help of a real person or fantasy person. Children then listen to this story before eating new foods as a way to imagine themselves participating in an expanded variety of foods while relaxed.&lt;ref name="nicholls" /&gt;
* The final stage, review, is important to keep track of the child's progress. It is important to include both one-on-one sessions with the child, as well as with the parent in order to get a clear picture of how the child is progressing and if the relaxation techniques are working.

The '''[[B movie]]''', whose roots trace to the [[silent film]] era, was a significant contributor to Hollywood's Golden Age of the 1930s and 1940s. As the Hollywood studios made the transition to [[sound film]] in the late 1920s, many independent exhibitors began adopting a new programming format: the [[double feature]]. The popularity of the twin bill required the production of relatively short, inexpensive movies to occupy the bottom half of the program. The double feature was the predominant presentation model at American theaters throughout the Golden Age, and B movies constituted the majority of Hollywood production during the period.

==Roots of the B movie: 1910s–1920s==
[[File:ThatCertainThing.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Columbia Pictures|Columbia]]'s silent ''That Certain Thing'' (1928), made for less than $20,000, ran about 69 minutes. The shine on its star, [[Viola Dana]], had faded since her glory days at [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|Metro-Goldwyn]]. The film's director was contracted for $1,000; its success earned him a $1,500 bonus. Soon, [[Frank Capra]]'s association with Columbia would help vault the studio toward Hollywood's major leagues.&lt;ref&gt;Hirschhorn (1999), pp. 9–10, 17.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
It is not clear that the term ''B movie'' (or ''B film'' or ''B picture'') was in general use before the 1930s; in terms of studio production, however, a similar concept was already well established. In 1916, [[Universal Studios|Universal]] became the first Hollywood studio to establish different feature brands based on production cost: the small Jewel line of "prestige" productions, midrange Bluebird releases, and the low-budget Red Feather line of five-reelers—a measure of film length indicating a running time between fifty minutes and an hour. The following year, the Butterfly line, a grade between Red Feather and Bluebird, was introduced. During those two years, about half of Universal's output was in the Red Feather and Butterfly categories.&lt;ref&gt;Hirschhorn (1983), pp. 13, 20–27.&lt;/ref&gt; According to historian Thomas Schatz, "These low-grade westerns, melodramas, and action pictures...underwent a disciplined production and marketing process," in contrast to the Jewels, which were not as strictly governed by studio policies.&lt;ref&gt;Schatz (1998), p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; While the down-market branding was soon eliminated, Universal continued to focus on low and modestly budgeted productions. In 1919, wealthy [[Paramount Pictures]] created its own distinct low-budget brand: the company's Realart films were made attractive to exhibitors with lower rental fees than movies from the studio's primary production line.&lt;ref&gt;Eames (1985), p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; Indicating the breadth of the budgetary range at a single studio, in 1921, when the average cost of a Hollywood feature was around $60,000,&lt;ref name=F41&gt;Finler (2003), pp. 41–42.&lt;/ref&gt; Universal spent approximately $34,000 on ''The Way Back'', a five-reeler, and over $1 million on ''Foolish Wives'', a top-of-the-line Super Jewel.&lt;ref&gt;Koszarski (1994), pp. 112, 113, 115; Schatz (1998), 22–25.&lt;/ref&gt; The production of inexpensive films like ''The Way Back'' allowed the studios to derive maximum value from facilities and contracted staff in between a studio's more important productions, while also breaking in new personnel.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Balio (1995), p. 29; Koszarski (1994), p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt; 

By 1927–28, at the end of the [[silent film|silent era]], the production cost of an average feature from Hollywood's [[major film studio]]s had soared, ranging from $190,000 at [[20th Century-Fox|Fox]] to $275,000 at [[MGM]].&lt;ref name=F41/&gt; These averages, again, reflected "specials" and "superspecials" that might cost as much as $1 million and films made quickly for around $50,000.&lt;ref&gt;Balio (1995), p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; Some studios, like large Paramount and growing [[Warner Bros.]], depended on [[block booking]] and blind bidding practices, under which "independent ('unaffiliated') theater owners were forced to take large numbers of the studio's pictures sight unseen. Those studios could then parcel out second-rate product along with A-class features and star vehicles, which made both production and distribution operations more economical."&lt;ref&gt;Schatz (1998), p. 39. See also p. 74; Koszarski (1994), pp. 71–72.&lt;/ref&gt; Studios in the minor leagues of the industry, such as [[Columbia Pictures]] and [[Film Booking Offices of America]] (FBO), focused on low-budget productions; most of their movies, with relatively short running times, targeted theaters that had to economize on rental and operating costs—particularly those in small towns and so-called neighborhood venues, or "nabes," in big cities. Even smaller outfits—the sort typical of Hollywood's so-called [[Poverty Row]]—made films whose production costs might run as low as $3,000, seeking a profit through whatever bookings they could pick up in the gaps left by the larger concerns.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Taves (1995), p. 320.&lt;/ref&gt; 

With the widespread arrival of [[sound film]] in American theaters in 1929, many independent exhibitors began dropping the then-dominant presentation model, which involved live acts and a broad variety of [[short subject|shorts]] before a single featured film.&lt;ref&gt;See Koszarski (1994), pp. 34–56.&lt;/ref&gt; A new programming scheme developed that would soon become standard practice: a [[newsreel]], a short and/or a [[movie serial|serial]], and a [[animated cartoon|cartoon]], followed by a double feature. The second feature, which actually screened before the main event, cost the exhibitor less per minute than the equivalent running time in shorts. The majors' comprehensive booking policy, which would become known as the ''run-zone-clearance'' system, inadvertently pushed independent theaters toward adopting the double-feature format. As described by historian Thomas Schatz, the system "sent a picture, after playing in the lucrative first-run arena, through the 16,000 'subsequent-run' movie houses; 'clearance' refers to the amount of time between runs, and 'zone' refers to the specific areas in which a film played. Typically, a top feature would play in its second run in smaller downtown theaters [many major-affiliated] and then move steadily outward from the urban centers to the suburbs, then to smaller cities and towns, and finally to rural communities, playing in ever smaller (and less profitable) venues and taking upwards of six months to complete its run."&lt;ref name="Schatz 1999, p. 16"&gt;Schatz (1999), p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; The "clearance" policy prevented independent exhibitors' timely access to top-quality films as a matter of course; the second feature allowed them to promote quantity instead.&lt;ref&gt;Balio (1995), p. 29. See also Schatz (1999), p. 324, for specific applications of "clearance."&lt;/ref&gt; The bottom-billed movie also gave the program "balance"—the practice of pairing different sorts of features suggested to potential customers that they could count on something of interest no matter what specifically was on the bill. As the president of one Poverty Row company would later put it, "Not everybody likes to eat cake. Some people like bread, and even a certain number of people like stale bread rather than fresh bread."&lt;ref&gt;Steve Broidy, president of [[Monogram Pictures]]/[[Allied Artists Pictures Corporation|Allied Artists]], quoted in Schatz (1999), p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt; The low-budget picture of the 1920s naturally transformed into the second feature, the B movie, of the 1930s and 1940s—the most reliable bread of Hollywood's Golden Age.

==Rise of the double feature: 1930s==
The major companies upon which the Hollywood [[studio system]] was built had been resistant to the B-movie trend, but they soon adapted. All ultimately established "B units" to provide films for the expanding second-feature market. [[Block booking]] increasingly became standard practice: in order to get access to a studio's attractive A pictures, many theaters were obliged to rent the company's entire output for a season. With the B films rented at a flat fee (rather than the box office percentage basis of A films), rates could be set that essentially guaranteed the profitability of every B movie. Blind bidding, which grew in parallel with block booking, meant that the majors didn't have to worry much about the quality of their B's—even when booking in less than seasonal blocks, exhibitors had to buy most pictures sight unseen. The five largest studios—[[MGM]], [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]], [[Fox Film Corporation]] ([[Twentieth Century Fox]] as of 1935), [[Warner Bros.]], and [[RKO Radio Pictures]] (descendant of FBO)—had the additional advantage of being part of companies that also owned sizable theater chains, further securing the bottom line. 
[[File:LadiesCravePoster.jpg|thumb|right|250px|It was from small [[Mascot Pictures]], but ''Ladies Crave Excitement'' (1935) still packed "Bursting Action, Deep Drama...And Up To Date Romance" into its 73 minutes. [[Film editing|Supervising editor]] [[Joseph H. Lewis]] would soon become a prolific director of B Westerns. His later [[film noirs]], including the independently produced ''[[Gun Crazy]]'' (1949), would become renowned.]]
Poverty Row studios, from modest outfits like [[Mascot Pictures]], [[Tiffany (movie studio)|Tiffany Studios]], and [[Sono Art-World Wide Pictures]] on down to shoestring operations, made exclusively B movies, serials, and other shorts. They also distributed totally independent productions and imported films. These studios were in no position to directly block book; instead, they mostly sold regional distribution exclusivity to "[[Film_distribution#Pre-studio_era|states rights]]" distributors, who would in turn peddle blocks of films to exhibitors, typically six or more movies featuring the same star (a relative status on Poverty Row).&lt;ref&gt;Taves (1995), pp. 326–27.&lt;/ref&gt; Two studios in the middle—the "major-minors" [[Universal Studios|Universal]] and [[Columbia Pictures|Columbia]], moving up in rank—had production lines roughly similar to the top Poverty Row concerns, if somewhat better endowed in general, and with a few up-market productions each year as well. They had few or no theaters, but they did have major-league-level distribution exchanges.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Balio (1995), pp. 103–4.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the model that would be standard during the Golden Age, the industry's top product, its A films, would premiere at a select number of deluxe first-run metropolitan cinemas, located in U.S. cities with populations in the range of 100,000 and above. There were fewer than 500 of these downtown movie palaces; in 1934, 77 percent of them were under the control of one or the other of the leading studios, the "Big Five."&lt;ref&gt;Schatz (1999), p. 16; Biesen (2005), p. 228, n. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; As a whole, the first-run circuit comprised the palaces and another 900 or so houses covering North America's 400 largest municipalities. Double features, though sometimes employed, were the rule at few if any of these prestigious venues. As described by historian Edward Jay Epstein, "During the[ir] first runs, films got their reviews, garnered publicity, and generated the word of mouth that served as the principal form of advertising."&lt;ref&gt;Epstein (2005), p. 6. See also Schatz (1999), pp. 16–17.&lt;/ref&gt; After a film's opening run, it was off to the nabes and the hinterland, the subsequent-run market where the double feature prevailed.&lt;ref&gt;See Waterman (2005), pp. 48–52, for a detailed examination of how the release system worked in practice.&lt;/ref&gt; At the larger local venues controlled by the majors, movies might turn over on a weekly basis. At the thousands of small theaters that belonged to independent chains or were individually owned, programs often changed two or three time a week, sometimes even faster. To keep up with the constant demand for new B product, the low end of Poverty Row turned out a stream of micro-budget movies rarely much more than sixty minutes long; these were known as "quickies" for their tight production schedules—a week's shooting was about average, just four days was not unheard of.&lt;ref name="Taves 1995, p. 325"&gt;Taves (1995), p. 325.&lt;/ref&gt; As historian Brian Taves describes, "Many of the poorest theaters, such as the 'grind houses' in the larger cities, screened a continuous program emphasizing action with no specific schedule, sometimes offering six quickies for a nickel in an all-night show that changed daily."&lt;ref&gt;Taves (1995), p. 326.&lt;/ref&gt; Many small theaters never saw a big-studio A film, getting their movies from the states rights concerns that handled almost exclusively Poverty Row product. Millions of Americans went to their local theaters as a matter of course: for an A picture, along with the [[Trailer (film)|trailers]], or screen previews, that had presaged its arrival, "[t]he new film's title on the marquee and the listings for it in the local newspaper constituted all the advertising most movies got."&lt;ref&gt;Epstein (2005), p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Aside from at the theater itself, B films might not be advertised at all.

The introduction of sound had driven costs higher. In 1930, the beginning of the Golden Age's first full decade, the average U.S. feature film cost $375,000 to produce.&lt;ref name=F42&gt;Finler (2003), p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; A broad range of Hollywood motion pictures occupied the B-movie category: The leading studios made not only clear-cut A and B films, but also movies classifiable as "programmers" (also "in-betweeners" or "intermediates"). These were films that "straddle[d] the A-B boundary," in Taves's description. During the era of the double feature, "[d]epending on the prestige of the theater and the other material on the double bill, a programmer could show up at the top or bottom of the marquee."&lt;ref&gt;Taves (1995), p. 317. Taves (like this article) adopts the usage of "programmer" argued for by author Don Miller in his 1973 study ''B Movies'' (New York: Ballantine). As Taves notes, "the term ''programmer'' was used in a variety of different ways by reviewers" of the 1930s (p. 431, n. 8). Some present-day critics employ the Miller–Taves usage; others refer to any B movie from the Golden Age as a "programmer" or "program picture."&lt;/ref&gt; On Poverty Row, many B's were made on budgets that would have barely covered petty cash on a major's A film, with costs at the bottom of the industry running as low as $5,000.&lt;ref name="Taves 1995, p. 325"/&gt; By the middle of the 1930s, the double feature was the dominant exhibition model across the country, and the majors responded. In 1935, B-movie production at Warner Bros. was raised from 12 to 50 percent of the studio's total output. The unit was headed by Bryan Foy, known as the "Keeper of the B's."&lt;ref&gt;Balio (1995), p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt; At Fox, which also shifted half of its production line into B territory, [[Sol M. Wurtzel]] was similarly in charge of more than twenty movies a year during the late 1930s. Loew's, the parent company of MGM, announced in 1935 that it would run double features at all of its subsequent-run theaters. A low-cost production unit was established at the studio under Lucien Hubbard, "although the term ''B movie'' was strictly taboo at Metro."&lt;ref&gt;Schatz (1998), pp. 170–71.&lt;/ref&gt; Columbia, which primarily served the B-movie market, expanded annual production from thirty pictures to more than forty.&lt;ref&gt;Balio (1995), p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of the top Poverty Row firms were consolidating: Sono Art joined with another company to create [[Monogram Pictures]] early in the decade. In 1935, Monogram, Mascot, and several smaller studios merged to form [[Republic Pictures]]. After little more than a year, the heads of Monogram pulled out and revived their company. Into the 1950s, Republic and Monogram released films that tended to be roughly on par with the low end of the majors' output. Less sturdy Poverty Row concerns—with a penchant for grand sobriquets like Conquest, Empire, Imperial, [[Supreme Pictures]] and Peerless—continued to churn out dirt-cheap quickies.&lt;ref&gt;See Taves (1995), pp. 321–29.&lt;/ref&gt; As the majors increased their B-level production and Republic and Monogram began to dominate Poverty Row, many of these smaller outfits folded by 1937.&lt;ref&gt;Taves (1995), p. 321.&lt;/ref&gt; Joel Finler has analyzed the average length of feature film releases from the various Hollywood studios in 1938, which indicates the degree to which each emphasized the production of B films ([[United Artists]] directly produced no features, focusing instead on the distribution of prestigious films made by independent outfits):&lt;ref&gt;Adapted from Finler (2003), p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

Grand National&lt;ref&gt;In operation from 1936 to 1940, [[Grand National Pictures]] was something like the United Artists of Poverty Row. Most of the films it released were the work of independent producers; in its peak year, 1937, Grand National did produce approximately twenty pictures of its own. See also Taves (1995), p. 323.&lt;/ref&gt;—63.6 minutes

Republic—63.1 minutes

Monogram—60.0 minutes

Taves estimates that half of the films produced by the eight majors in the 1930s were B movies. Calculating in the three hundred or so films made annually by the many Poverty Row firms, approximately 75 percent of Hollywood movies from the decade, more than four thousand pictures, are classifiable as B's.&lt;ref&gt;Taves (1995), p. 313.&lt;/ref&gt; Outside of the highly standardized realm of the series picture, studio executives saw developmental opportunities in their B lines of production. In 1937, RKO production chief Sam Briskin described his company's B films as "a testing ground for new names, and experiments in story and treatment."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Lasky (1989), p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Republic Pictures]]' ''[[Pals of the Saddle]]'' (1938) lasts just 55 minutes, perfectly average for a Three Mesquiteers adventure.]]
The western was by far the predominant B genre in both the 1930s and, to a somewhat lesser degree, the 1940s; for most of the Golden Age, westerns of every stripe accounted for 25 to 30 percent of all Hollywood feature production.&lt;ref&gt;Nachbar (1974), p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Film historian Jon Tuska has argued that "the 'B' product of the Thirties—the Universal films with [[Tom Mix|[Tom] Mix]], [[Ken Maynard|[Ken] Maynard]], and [[Buck Jones|[Buck] Jones]], the Columbia features with Buck Jones and [[Tim McCoy]], the RKO [[George O'Brien (actor)|George O'Brien]] series, the Republic westerns with [[John Wayne]] and the Three Mesquiteers...achieved a uniquely American perfection of the well-made story."&lt;ref&gt;Tuska (1974), p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; At the far end of the industry, Poverty Row's Ajax put out films starring [[Harry Carey (actor)|Harry Carey]], then in his fifties. The Weiss outfit had the Range Rider series, the American Rough Rider series, and the Morton of the Mounted "northwest action thrillers" that gave top billing to Dynamite, the Wonder Horse and Captain, the King of Dogs.&lt;ref&gt;Taves (1995), p. 327–28.&lt;/ref&gt; One notable low-budget western of the era, produced totally outside of the studio system, made money off a curious concept: a western with an all-midget cast, ''[[The Terror of Tiny Town]]'' (1938) was such a success in its independent bookings that Columbia picked it up for distribution.&lt;ref&gt;Taves (1995), p. 316.&lt;/ref&gt;

Series of various genres were particularly popular during the first decade of sound film. At just one major studio, Fox, B series produced by Sol  Wurtzel included "[[Charlie Chan]], [[Mr. Moto]], [[Sherlock Holmes]], Michael Shayne, the [[Cisco Kid]], George O'Brien westerns [before his move to RKO], the Gambini sports films, the Roving Reporters, the Camera Daredevils, the Big Town Girls, the hotel for women, the Jones Family, the [[Jane Withers]] children's films, [[Jeeves]], [and] the [[Ritz Brothers]]."&lt;ref&gt;Taves (1995), p. 318.&lt;/ref&gt; These feature-length series films are not to be confused with the short, [[cliffhanger]]-structured serials that sometimes appeared on the same program. As with serials, however, many series were specifically intended to interest young people—some of the theaters that twin-billed part-time might run a "balanced" or entirely youth-oriented double feature as a matinee and then a single film for a more mature audience at night. In the words of a contemporary [[George Gallup|Gallup]] industry report, afternoon moviegoers, "composed largely of housewives and children, want quantity for their money while the evening crowds want 'something good and not too much of it.'"&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Schatz (1999), p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt;

Series films are often unquestioningly consigned to the B-movie category, but even here there is ambiguity, as scholar James Naremore describes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The most profitable B pictures functioned much like the comic strips in the daily newspapers, showing the continuing adventures of [[Roy Rogers]] [Republic], [[Boston Blackie]] [Columbia], the [[Dead End Kids|Bowery Boys]] [Warner Bros./Universal], [[Blondie (1938 film)|Blondie and Dagwood]] [Columbia], Charlie Chan [Fox/Monogram], and so on. Even a major studio like MGM [the industry leader from 1931 through 1941] was equipped with a so-called B unit that specialized in these serial {{sic}} productions. At MGM, however, the [[Andy Hardy]], [[Dr. Kildare|Dr. Kildaire]] {{sic}}, and [[The Thin Man (film)|Thin Man]] films were made with major stars and with what some organizations would have considered A budgets.&lt;ref&gt;Naremore (1998), p. 141. For more on the finances and industrial position of the Andy Hardy movies, see Schatz (1998), pp. 256–61.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
For some series, of course, even a major studio's B budget was far out of reach: Poverty Row's Consolidated Pictures, backed by Weiss, featured Tarzan, the Police Dog in a series with the proud name of Melodramatic Dog Features.&lt;ref&gt;Taves (1995), p. 328.&lt;/ref&gt; 

A few down-market independent productions were more ambitious: ''[[White Zombie (film)|White Zombie]]'' (1932), directed by [[Victor Hugo Halperin|Victor Halperin]] and starring [[Béla Lugosi]], is now regarded as the archetypal zombie movie, though it was poorly received at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Prawer (1989), p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt; It was picked up by United Artists for distribution after it lost deals with Columbia and the small [[Educational Pictures]].&lt;ref&gt;Rhodes (2001), pp. 111–13.&lt;/ref&gt; On occasion, a low-end movie would get separated from the pack. Reviewing the 77-minute Universal crime melodrama ''Rio'' (1939), the ''New York Times'' declared that director "[[John Brahm]]'s impact on the Class B picture is producing one of the strangest sound effects in recent cinema history. It is that of an unmistakable B buzzing like an A."&lt;ref&gt;Nugent (1939), p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bs from major to minor: 1940s==
[[File:WifeWantedPoster.jpg|thumb|right|250px|An [[exploitation film|exploitation]]-style pitch from [[Monogram Pictures|Monogram]] for ''Wife Wanted'' (1946). Director [[Phil Karlson]] would go on to direct several exceptionally tough noirs in the next decade. Lead and producer [[Kay Francis]] had been a major star in the 1930s. This was her last movie.]]
By 1940, the average production cost of an American feature was $400,000, a negligible increase over ten years.&lt;ref name=F42/&gt; A number of small Hollywood companies had folded around the turn of the decade, including the ambitious Grand National, but a new firm, [[Producers Releasing Corporation]] (PRC), emerged as third in the Poverty Row hierarchy behind Republic and Monogram. The double feature, never universal, was still the prevailing exhibition model: in 1941, 50 percent of theaters were double-billing exclusively, with additional numbers screening under the policy part-time.&lt;ref&gt;Schatz (1999), p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1940s, legal pressure forced the studios to replace seasonal block booking with packages generally limited to five pictures (MGM carried on with blocks of twelve for a while). Restrictions were also placed on the majors' ability to enforce blind bidding.&lt;ref&gt;Schatz (1999), pp. 19–21, 45, 72, 160–63. See also Taves (1995), pp. 314–15.&lt;/ref&gt; These were crucial factors in the progressive shift by most of the Big Five over to A-film production, making the smaller studios even more important as B-movie suppliers. In 1944, for instance, MGM, Paramount, Fox, and Warners released a total of ninety-five features: fourteen had B-level budgets of $200,000 or less; eleven were budgeted between $200,000 and $500,000, a range encompassing programmers as well as straight B movies on the lower end; and seventy were A budgeted at $0.5 million or more.&lt;ref&gt;Analysis based on Schatz (1999), p. 173, table 6.3.&lt;/ref&gt; In late 1946, executives at the newly merged Universal-International announced that no U-I feature would run less than seventy minutes; supposedly, all B pictures were to be discontinued, even if they were in the midst of production.&lt;ref&gt;Hirschhorn (1983), p. 156.&lt;/ref&gt; The studio did release three more sub-70-minute films: two [[Cinecolor]] westerns, ''[[Michigan Kid]]'' and ''[[The Vigilantes Return]]'', in 1947; the self-explanatory ''[[Arctic Manhunt]]'' in 1949.&lt;ref&gt;Hirschhorn (1983), pp. 172, 173, 182.&lt;/ref&gt; Fox also phased out B production in 1946, releasing low-budget unit chief Bryan Foy, who had come over from Warners five years before. For its B-picture needs, the studio turned to independent producers like the now-freelance Sol Wurtzel.&lt;ref&gt;Schatz (1999), p. 335.&lt;/ref&gt;

Genre pictures made at very low cost remained the backbone of Poverty Row, with even Republic's and Monogram's budgets rarely climbing over $200,000. According to Naremore, between 1945 and 1950, "the average B western from Republic Pictures was made for about $50,000."&lt;ref&gt;Naremore (1998), p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt; Among the established studios, Monogram was exploring fresh territory with what were being called "[[exploitation film|exploitation pictures]]." ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' defined these as "films with some timely or currently controversial subject which can be exploited, capitalized on in publicity or advertising."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Schatz (1999), p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt; Many smaller Poverty Row firms were folding because there simply was not enough money to go around: the eight majors, with their proprietary distribution exchanges, were now "taking in around 95 percent of all domestic (U.S. and Canada) rental receipts."&lt;ref name="Schatz 1999, p. 16"/&gt; The wartime shortage of film stock was another contributing factor.&lt;ref&gt;Buhle and Wagner (2003), p. 154.&lt;/ref&gt;

Referencing the work of historian Lea Jacobs, Naremore describes how the line between A and B movies was "ambiguous and never dependent on money alone."&lt;ref&gt;Naremore (1998), p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt; Films shot on B-level budgets were occasionally marketed as A pictures or emerged as [[sleeper hit]]s: One of 1943's biggest films was [[Hitler's Children (1943 film)|''Hitler's Children'']], an 82-minute-long RKO thriller made for a fraction over $200,000. It earned more than $3 million in rentals, industry language for a distributor's share of gross [[box office]] receipts.&lt;ref&gt;Jewell (1982), 181; Lasky (1989), 184–85.&lt;/ref&gt; The violent ''[[Dillinger (1945 film)|Dillinger]]'' (1945), made for a reported $35,000, earned Monogram more than $1 million for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;Cost: Per screenwriter [[Philip Yordan]], commentary track on Warner Home Video DVD of film. Earnings: Schatz (1999), p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt; A pictures, particularly in the realm of [[film noir]], sometimes echoed visual styles generally associated with cheaper films. Between November 1941 and November 1943, [[Dore Schary]] ran what was effectively a "B-plus" unit at MGM.&lt;ref&gt;Schatz (1998), pp. 367–70.&lt;/ref&gt; Programmers, with their flexible exhibition role, were ambiguous by definition, leading in certain cases to historical confusion. As late as 1948, the double feature remained a popular exhibition mode—it was the standard screening policy at 25 percent of theaters and used part-time at an additional 36 percent.&lt;ref&gt;Schatz (1999), p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; The leading Poverty Row firms began to broaden their scope: In 1947, Monogram established a subsidiary, [[Allied Artists Pictures Corporation|Allied Artists]], as a development and distribution channel for relatively expensive films, mostly from independent producers. Around the same time, Republic launched a similar effort under the "Premiere" rubric.&lt;ref&gt;Schatz (1999), pp. 340–41.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1947 as well, PRC was subsumed by [[Eagle-Lion Films|Eagle-Lion]], a British company seeking entry to the American market. Warners' (and Fox's) former Keeper of the B's, Brian Foy, was installed as production chief.&lt;ref&gt;Schatz (1999), p. 295; Naremore (1998), p. 142; [http://www.searchmytrash.com/articles/prc(8-05).shtml PRC (Producers Releasing Corporation)] essay by Mike Haberfelner, August 2005; part of the ''(re)Search my Trash'' website.

===Sinners and saints===
[[File:RawDealPoster2.jpg|thumb|left|250px|''[[Raw Deal (1948 film)|Raw Deal]]'', a 1948 [[film noir]], was put out by Poverty Row's [[Eagle-Lion Films|Eagle-Lion]] firm. Such movies were routinely marketed as pure sensationalism, but many noirs were also works of great visual beauty. Directed by [[Anthony Mann]] and [[cinematography|shot]] by [[John Alton]], ''Raw Deal'' "is resplendent with velvety blacks, mists, netting, and other expressive accessories of poetic noir decor and lighting."&lt;ref&gt;Robert Smith, "Mann in the Dark," quoted in Ottoson (1981), p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In the 1940s, RKO—the weakest of the Big Five throughout its history—stood out among the industry's largest companies for its focus on B pictures. From a latter-day perspective, the most famous of the major studios' Golden Age B units is [[Val Lewton]]'s horror unit at RKO. Lewton produced such moody, mysterious films as ''[[Cat People (1942 film)|Cat People]]'' (1942), ''[[I Walked with a Zombie]]'' (1943), and ''[[The Body Snatcher (film)|The Body Snatcher]]'' (1945), directed by [[Jacques Tourneur]], [[Robert Wise]], and others who would become renowned only later in their careers or entirely in retrospect. The movie now widely described as the first classic film noir—''[[Stranger on the Third Floor]]'' (1940), a 64-minute B—was produced at RKO, which would release many melodramatic thrillers in a similarly stylish vein during the decade. The other major studios also turned out a considerable number of movies now identified as noir during the 1940s. Though many of the best-known film noirs were well-financed productions—the majority of Warner Bros. noirs, for instance, were produced at the studio's A level—most 1940s pictures in the mode were either of the ambiguous programmer type or destined straight for the bottom of the bill. In the decades since, these cheap entertainments, generally dismissed at the time, have become some of the most treasured products of Hollywood's Golden Age among aficionados.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Dave Kehr, "Critic's Choice: New DVD's," ''New York Times'', August 22, 2006; Dave Kehr, "Critic's Choice: New DVD's," ''New York Times'', June 7, 2005; Robert Sklar, "Film Noir Lite: When Actions Have No Consequences," ''New York Times'', "Week in Review," June 2, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In one sample year, 1947, RKO under production chief Dore Schary shot fifteen A-level features at an average cost of $1 million and twenty Bs averaging $215,000.&lt;ref&gt;Schatz (1998), pp. 442–43.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to several noir programmers and full-flight A pictures, the studio put out two straight B noirs: ''[[Desperate (film)|Desperate]]'', directed by [[Anthony Mann]], and ''[[The Devil Thumbs a Ride]]'', directed by [[Felix E. Feist]]. Ten straight B noirs that year came from Poverty Row's big three: Republic (''[[Blackmail (1947 film)|Blackmail]]'' and ''[[The Pretender (film)|The Pretender]]''), Monogram (''[[Fall Guy (1947 film)|Fall Guy]]'', ''[[The Guilty (1947 film)|The Guilty]]'', ''[[High Tide (1947 film)|High Tide]]'', and ''[[Violence (film)|Violence]]''), and PRC/Eagle-Lion (''[[Bury Me Dead]]'', ''Lighthouse'', ''[[Whispering City]]'', and ''[[Railroaded]]'', another work of Mann). One came from tiny Screen Guild (''[[Shoot to Kill (1947 film)|Shoot to Kill]]''). Three majors beside RKO also contributed: Columbia (''[[Blind Spot (1947 film)|Blind Spot]]'' and ''[[Framed (1947 film)|Framed]]''), Paramount (''[[Fear in the Night (1947 film)|Fear in the Night]]''), and 20th Century-Fox (''[[Backlash (1947 film)|Backlash]]'' and ''[[The Brasher Doubloon]]''). Adding programmers to that list of eighteen would bring it to around thirty. Still, most of the majors' low-budget production during the decade was of the sort now largely ignored. RKO's representative output included the [[Lupe Vélez|Mexican Spitfire]] and [[Lum and Abner]] comedy series, thrillers featuring the [[Simon Templar|Saint]] and the [[The Falcon (literary character)|Falcon]], westerns starring [[Tim Holt]], and [[Tarzan]] movies with [[Johnny Weissmuller]]. [[Jean Hersholt]] played Dr. Christian in six independently produced films released by RKO between 1939 and 1941. ''The Courageous Dr. Christian'' (1940) was a standard entry in the franchise: "In the course of an hour or so of screen time, the saintly physician managed to cure an epidemic of spinal meningitis, demonstrate benevolence towards the disenfranchised, set an example for wayward youth, and calm the passions of an amorous old maid."&lt;ref&gt;Jewell (1982), p. 147.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Down in Poverty Row, low budgets led to less palliative fare. Republic aspired to major-league respectability while making lots of cheap and modestly budgeted westerns, but there was not much from the bigger studios that compared with Monogram "exploitation pictures" like [[juvenile delinquency]] [[investigative journalism|exposé]] ''Where Are Your Children?'' (1943) and the prison film ''[[Women in Bondage]]'' (1943).&lt;ref&gt;Schatz (1999), p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1947, PRC's ''[[The Devil on Wheels (1947 film)|The Devil on Wheels]]'' brought together teenagers, [[hot rods]], and death. The little studio had its own house [[auteur]]: with his own crew and relatively free rein, director [[Edgar G. Ulmer]] was known as "the Capra of PRC."&lt;ref&gt;Naremore (1998), p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt; Described by critic and historian David Thomson as "one of the most fascinating talents in the worldwide labyrinth of sub-B pictures," Ulmer made films of every generic stripe.&lt;ref&gt;Thomson (1994), p. 764.&lt;/ref&gt; His ''[[Girls in Chains]]'' was released in May 1943, six months before ''Women in Bondage''; by the end of the year, Ulmer had also made the teen-themed musical ''Jive Junction'' as well as ''[[Isle of Forgotten Sins]]'', a South Seas adventure set around a brothel.

The '''Brumby Rocker''' is a [[rocking chair]] built by the '''Brumby Chair Factory''' of the '''Brumby Chair Company''' in [[Marietta, Georgia]], which operated between 1875 and 1942, or by its successor which started in 1972.  They are big, sturdy, built to last, and difficult to manufacture.  New ones cost about $1,000.&lt;ref&gt;In 2016, Brumby Rockers are listed at $995 at Houzz on the internet.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Jimmy Carter]] brought five to the [[White House]].&lt;ref name=winds&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/03/07/us/marietta-journal-winds-of-change-rock-a-classic-rocking-chair.html |title=Marietta Journal; Winds of Change Rock A Classic Rocking Chair |author=Peter Applebome |publisher=[[New York Times]] |date=March 7, 1989 |accessdate=September 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7610">[[File:Cross elasticity of demand complements.svg|thumb|Complementary goods exhibit a negative [[cross elasticity of demand]]: as the price of goods Y rises, the demand for good X falls.]]

In [[economics]], a '''complementary goods''' or '''complement''' is a [[Goods (economics)|goods]] with a negative [[cross elasticity of demand]], in contrast to a [[substitute goods]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=O'Sullivan |first=Arthur |authorlink=Arthur O'Sullivan (economist) |first2=Steven M. |last2=Sheffrin |authorlink2=Steven M. Sheffrin |title = Economics: Principles in Action |publisher = Pearson Prentice Hall |year=2003 |location=Upper Saddle River, New Jersey |page=88 |isbn=0-13-063085-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means a good's demand is increased when the price of another goods is decreased. Conversely, the demand for a goods is decreased when the price of another goods is increased.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Carbaugh|first=Robert|title=Contemporary Economics: An Applications Approach|publisher=Cengage Learning|year=2006|isbn=978-0-324-31461-8|page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; If goods A and B are complements, an increase in the price of A will result in a leftward movement along the demand curve of A and cause the demand curve for B to [[Demand curve#Changes that decrease demand|shift in]]; less of each goods will be demanded. 
A decrease in price of A will result in a rightward movement along the demand curve of A and cause the demand curve B to [[Demand curve#Changes that increase demand|shift outward]]; more of each goods will be demanded. Basically this means that since the demand of one goods is linked to the demand of another goods, if a higher quantity is demanded of one goods, a higher quantity will also be demanded of the other, and if a lower quantity is demanded of one goods, a lower quantity will be demanded of the other. The prices of complementary goods are related in the same way: if the price of one goods rises, so will the price of the other, and vice versa. With substitute goods, however, the price and quantity demanded of one goods is related inversely to the price and quantity demanded of a substitute goods, meaning that if the price or quantity demanded of one goods rises, the price or quantity demanded of its substitute will fall.

When two goods are complements, they experience '''joint demand'''. For example, the demand for razor blades may depend upon the number of razors in use; this is why razors have sometimes been sold as [[loss leader]]s, to increase demand for the associated blades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://futureobservatory.dyndns.org/9432.htm |publisher=Future Observatory |title=Customer in Marketing by David Mercer |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130404042855/http://futureobservatory.dyndns.org/9432.htm |archive-date=2013-04-04 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent work in food consumption has elucidated the [[Psychology|psychological processes]] by which the consumption of one goods (e.g., cola) stimulates demand for its complements (e.g., a cheeseburger, pizza, etc.). Consumption of a food or beverage '''[[Goal setting|activates a goal]] to consume''' its complements: foods that consumers believe would produce super-additive utility (i.e., would taste better together). Eating peanut-butter covered crackers, for instance, increases the consumption of grape-jelly covered crackers more than eating plain crackers. Drinking cola increases consumers' [[willingness to pay]] for a voucher for a cheeseburger. This effect appears to be contingent on consumers' perceptions of what foods are complements rather than their sensory properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Huh|first = Young Eun|last2 = Vosgerau|first2 = Joachim|last3 = Morewedge|first3 = Carey K.|date = 2016-03-14|title = Selective Sensitization: Consuming a Food Activates a Goal to Consume its Complements|url = http://journals.ama.org/doi/10.1509/jmr.12.0240|journal = Journal of Marketing Research|doi = 10.1509/jmr.12.0240|issn = 0022-2437}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
[[File:Supply-and-demand.svg|thumb|alt=Supply and Demand curves.|Supply and demand of hotdogs when the price of buns decreases]]

An example of this would be the demand for [[car]]s and [[petrol]].  The [[supply and demand]] of cars is represented by the figure at the right with the initial demand D1. Suppose that the initial price of cars is represented by P1 with a quantity demanded of Q1. If the price of petrol were to decrease by some amount, this would result in a higher quantity of cars demanded. This higher quantity demanded would cause the demand curve to [[Demand curve#Shift of a demand curve|shift rightward]] to a new position D2. Assuming a constant supply curve S of cars, the new increased quantity demanded will be at D2 with a new increased price P2. Other examples include: Automobile and fuel, mobile phone and cellular service provider, Printer and Cartridge among others.

==Perfect complement==
[[File:Indifference-curves-perfect-complements.svg|thumb|[[Indifference curve]] for perfect complements]]
A '''perfect complement''' is a good that ''has'' to be consumed with another good. The [[indifference curve]] of a perfect complement will exhibit a right angle, as illustrated by the figure at the right.&lt;ref name=mankiw&gt;{{cite book|last=Mankiw|first=Gregory|title=Principle of Economics|publisher=Cengage Learning|year= 2008|ISBN=978-0-324-58997-9|pages=463–464}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such preferences are often represented by a [[Leontief utility]] function.

Few goods in the real world will behave as perfect complements.&lt;ref name=mankiw /&gt; One example is a left shoe and a right; shoes are naturally sold in pairs, and the ratio between sales of left and right shoes will never shift noticeably from 1:1, even if, for example, someone is missing a leg and buys just one shoe.

The degree of complementarity, however, does not have to be mutual; it can be measured by [[Cross elasticity of demand|cross price elasticity of demand]]. In the case of video games, a specific video game (the complement good) has to be consumed with a video game console (the base good). It does not work the other way: a video game console does not have to be consumed with that game.

===Example===
A classic example of mutually perfect complements is the case of pencils and erasers. Imagine an [[accountant]] who will need to prepare financial statements, but in doing so must use pencils to make all calculations and erasers to correct errors. The accountant knows that for every three pencils, one eraser will be needed. Any more pencils will serve no purpose, because they will not be able to erase the calculations. Any more erasers will not be useful either, because there will not be enough pencils for them to make a large enough mess with in order to require more erasers.

In this case the [[utility]] would be given by an increasing function of:
: min (number of pencils, 3 × number of erasers)

In [[marketing]], complementary goods give additional [[market power]] to the company. It allows [[vendor lock-in]] as it increases the [[switching cost]]. A few types of [[pricing strategies|pricing strategy]] exist for a complementary good and its base good:

*Pricing the base good at a relatively low price to the complementary good - this approach allows easy entry by consumers (e.g. consumer printer vs. ink jet cartridge)
*Pricing the base good at a relatively high price to the complementary good - this approach creates a barrier to entry and exit (e.g. golf club membership vs. green fees)

[[File:Triceratops-vs-T-Rex001.jpg|thumb|275px|Models recreating a fight between ''[[Triceratops]]'' and ''[[Tyrannosaurus rex]]''. Epic battles that might have occurred are a popular theme.]]
[[File:PikiWiki Israel 8174 dinosaur in rishon lezion.jpg|thumb|245px|A big model of ''[[Brachiosaurus]]'' in [[Rishon LeZion]]'s [[Cinema City (Israel)|Cinema City]], [[Israel]].]]

'''Cultural depictions of dinosaurs''' have been numerous since the word ''[[dinosaur]]'' was coined in 1842. The dinosaurs featured in books, films, television programs, artwork, and other media have been used for both education and entertainment. The depictions range from the realistic, as in the television [[documentary film|documentaries]] of the 1990s and first decade of the 21st century, or the fantastic, as in the [[monster movie]]s of the 1950s and 1960s.

The growth in interest in dinosaurs since the [[Dinosaur Renaissance]] has been accompanied by depictions made by artists working with ideas at the forefront of dinosaur science, presenting lively dinosaurs and [[feathered dinosaur]]s as these concepts were first being considered. Cultural depictions of dinosaurs have been an important means of translating scientific discoveries to the public.

Cultural depictions have also created or reinforced misconceptions about dinosaurs and other prehistoric animals, such as inaccurately and anachronistically portraying a sort of "prehistoric world" where many kinds of extinct animals (from the [[Permian]] animal ''[[Dimetrodon]]'' to [[mammoth]]s and [[caveman|cavemen]]) lived together, and dinosaurs lived lives of constant combat. Other misconceptions reinforced by cultural depictions came from a scientific consensus that has now been overturned, such as dinosaurs being slow and unintelligent, or the use of ''dinosaur'' to describe something that is maladapted or obsolete. 

Depictions are necessarily conjectural, because [[petrification]] and other [[fossilization]] mechanisms do not preserve all details. Any reconstitution is thereby an artist's view that, in order to stay within the limits of the best knowledge at the time, must necessarily be inspired by other pictures already scientifically proved.

==History of depictions==

===Early human history to 1900: Early depictions===
[[File:Protoceratops-skeleton.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Protoceratops]]'' skeleton at the [[Wyoming Dinosaur Center]]]]
The classical [[folklore|folklorist]] [[Adrienne Mayor]] has proposed that the [[griffin]] of [[mythology]] is based on dinosaur skeletons found in the [[Gobi Desert]]. She noted that griffins were said to inhabit the [[Scythia]]n [[steppe]]s that reached from modern [[Ukraine]] to central Asia. Mayor draws a connection to ''[[Protoceratops]]'', a [[neck frill|frilled dinosaur]] commonly found in the Gobi&lt;ref name="AFM00"&gt;{{cite book |last=Mayor |first=Adrienne |authorlink=Adrienne Mayor |title=The First Fossil Hunters: Paleontology in Greek and Roman Times |year=2000 |location=Princeton |publisher=[[Princeton University Press]] |isbn=0-691-05863-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;, sharing features associated with griffins: sharp beaks, four legs, claws, similar size, and large eyes (or eye sockets in the case of the fossils); and the neck frill of ''Protoceratops'', with large open holes, is consistent with descriptions of the griffin's large ears or wings.&lt;ref name="PD96"&gt;{{cite book |last=Dodson |first=Peter |authorlink=Peter Dodson |year=1996 |title=The Horned Dinosaurs| location=Princeton |publisher=Princeton University Press |pages=225–226 |isbn=0-691-05900-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the palaeontologist Mark Witton notes that the suggestion ignores pre-[[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean]] accounts, and has not found favour with archaeologists including N. Wyatt and T.F. Tartaron.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Witton, Mark |url=http://markwitton-com.blogspot.pt/2016/04/why-protoceratops-almost-certainly.html |title=Why Protoceratops Almost Certainly Wasn't The Inspiration For Griffin Legend |accessdate=2 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tartaron, T.

[[File:London - Crystal Palace - Victorian Dinosaurs 1.jpg|right|thumb|A ''[[Megalosaurus]]'' statue at [[Crystal Palace Park]] in [[London]].]]
The scientific study of dinosaurs began in 1820s England. In 1842, [[Richard Owen]] coined the term ''dinosaur'', which in his vision were elephantine [[reptile]]s. An ambitious promoter of his discoveries and theories, Owen was the driving force for the [[Crystal Palace Dinosaurs|Crystal Palace dinosaur sculptures]], the first large-scale public dinosaur reconstructions (1854). These sculptures, which can still be seen today, immortalized a very early stage in the perception of dinosaurs.&lt;ref name="HT97"&gt;Torrens, Hugh. "Politics and Paleontology". ''The Complete Dinosaur,'' 175–190.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Crystal Palace sculptures were successful enough that [[Benjamin Waterhouse Hawkins]], Owen's collaborator, sold models of his sculptures&lt;ref name="DFG97"&gt;{{cite book |last=Glut |first=Donald F. |authorlink=Donald F. Glut |author2=Brett-Surman, Michael K.|year=1997 |chapter=Dinosaurs and the media |title=The Complete Dinosaur |publisher=[[Indiana University Press]] |location=Bloomington and Indianapolis |pages=675–706 |isbn=0-253-33349-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; and planned a second exhibition, [[Paleozoic Museum]], for [[Central Park]] in [[Manhattan]] in the late 1860s; it was never completed due to the interference of local politics and "Boss" [[William Marcy Tweed]].&lt;ref name="EHC59"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Colbert |first=Edwin H. |authorlink=Edwin Harris Colbert |year=1959 |last2=Beneker |first2=Katharine |title=The Palaeozoic Museum in Central Park, or the Museum that Never Was |journal=Curator |volume=2 |pages=137–150 |doi=10.1111/j.2151-6952.1959.tb01403.x |issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the same period, dinosaurs first appeared in popular literature, with a passing mention of an Owen-style ''[[Megalosaurus]]'' in [[Charles Dickens]]'s ''[[Bleak House]]'' (1852–1853).&lt;ref name="bleakhouse"&gt;"''London. Michaelmas term lately over, and the Lord Chancellor sitting in Lincoln's Inn Hall. Implacable November weather. As much mud in the streets, as if the waters had but newly retired from the face of the earth, and it would not be wonderful to meet a Megalosaurus, forty feet long or so, waddling like an elephantine lizard up Holborne Hill.''" From page 1 of Dickens, Charles J.H. (1852). ''[[s:Bleak House/Chapter I|Bleak House, Chapter I: In Chancery]]''. London: Bradbury &amp; Evans.&lt;/ref&gt; However, depictions of dinosaurs were rare in the 19th century, possibly due to incomplete knowledge. Despite the well-publicized "[[Bone Wars]]" of the late 19th century between the American palaeontologists [[Edward Drinker Cope]] and [[Othniel Charles Marsh]], dinosaurs were not yet ingrained in culture. Marsh, although a pioneer of skeletal reconstructions, did not support putting mounted skeletons on display, and derided the Crystal Palace sculptures.&lt;ref name="PD96b"&gt;Dodson, Peter. ''The Horned Dinosaurs,'' 74–75.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1900 to the 1930s: New media===
[[File:Laelaps-Charles Knight-1897.jpg|thumb|left|The 1897 painting of "''Laelaps''" (now ''[[Dryptosaurus]]'') by [[Charles R. Knight]].]]
As study caught up to the wealth of new material from western North America, and venues for depictions proliferated, dinosaurs gained in popularity. The paintings of [[Charles R. Knight]] were the first influential representations of these finds. Knight worked extensively with the [[American Museum of Natural History]] and its director, [[Henry Fairfield Osborn]], who wanted to use dinosaurs and other prehistoric animals to promote his museum&lt;ref name="GSP00"&gt;{{cite book |last=Paul |first=Gregory S. |authorlink=Gregory S. Paul |editor=Paul, Gregory S. (ed.) |title=The Scientific American Book of Dinosaurs |year=2000 |publisher=St. Martin's Press |location=New York |isbn=0-312-26226-4 |pages=113–118 |chapter=The Art of Charles R. Knight }}&lt;/ref&gt; and his ideas on evolution.&lt;ref name="KP04"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Padian |first=Kevin |authorlink=Kevin Padian |year=2004 |title=An Agenda for Antiquity: Henry Fairfield Osborn and Vertebrate Paleontology at the American Museum of Natural History, 1890–1935 and Henry Fairfield Osborn: Race and the search for the origins of man |journal=Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology |volume=24 |issue=3 |pages=769–771 |doi=10.1671/0272-4634(2004)024[0769:AAFAHF]2.0.CO;2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Knight's work, found in museums around the United States, helped popularize dinosaurs and influenced generations of [[paleoartists]]. His early work showing fighting "Laelaps" (=''[[Dryptosaurus]]'') depicted dinosaurs as much more lively than they would be presented for much of the 20th century.&lt;ref name="GSP00"/&gt; At the same time, improvements in casting allowed dinosaur skeletons to be reproduced and shipped across the world for display in far-flung museums, bringing them to the attention of a wider audience; ''[[Diplodocus]]'' was the first such dinosaur reproduced in this way.&lt;ref name="RTB86"&gt;{{cite book |last=Bakker |first=Robert T. |authorlink=Robert T. Bakker |year=1986 |title=The Dinosaur Heresies |publisher=William Morrow |location=New York |isbn=0-14-010055-5 |page=203 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Gertie the Dinosaur.ogv|thumb|thumbtime=6:58|[[Winsor McCay]]'s animated ''[[Brontosaurus]]'' in the 1914 film ''[[Gertie the Dinosaur]]''.]]
Dinosaurs began appearing in films soon after the introduction of cinema, the first being the good-natured [[animation|animated]] ''[[Gertie the Dinosaur]]'' in 1914.&lt;ref name="WAS01"&gt;{{cite book |last=Sarjeant |first=William A.S. |year=2001 |chapter=Dinosaurs in fiction |editors=Tanke, Darren H.; and Carpenter, K. (eds.) |title=Mesozoic Vertebrate Life |publisher=Indiana University Press |location=Bloomington and Indianapolis |pages=504–529 |isbn=0-253-33907-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, lovable dinosaurs were quickly replaced  as moviemakers recognized the thrill of huge frightening [[monster]]s.&lt;ref name="BS88"&gt;{{cite book |last=Searles |first=Baird |title=Films of Science Fiction and Fantasy |pages=104–116 |chapter= Dinosaurs and others |year= 1988|publisher=AFI Press |location=New York |isbn=0-8109-0922-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[D. W. Griffith]] in 1914's ''[[Brute Force (1914 film)|Brute Force]]'' provided the first example of a threatening cinematic dinosaur, a ''[[Ceratosaurus]]'' who menaced cavemen. This film enshrined the fiction that dinosaurs and early humans lived together, and set up the cliché that dinosaurs were bloodthirsty and attacked anything that moved.&lt;ref name="DFG97"/&gt;

The now-common trope of dinosaurs extant in isolated locations in today's world appeared at the same time, beginning with [[Arthur Conan Doyle]]'s ''[[The Lost World (Arthur Conan Doyle)|The Lost World]]'' (1912) and the works of [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]]. ''The Lost World'' [[The Lost World (1925 film)|crossed into the movies]] in 1925, setting heights for [[special effects]] and attempts at scientific accuracy. It is unusual, even today, for attempting to portray dinosaurs as something other than monsters in constant combat.

The [[stop-motion]] techniques of [[Willis O'Brien]] went on to bring dinosaurs to life in the 1933 film ''[[King Kong (1933 film)|King Kong]]'', which merged the tropes of dinosaur combat and dinosaurs in a lost world.&lt;ref name="DFG97"/&gt; His protégé [[Ray Harryhausen]] would continue to refine this method, but most later dinosaurs movies until the advent of [[computer generated imagery|CGI]] would eschew such expensive effects for cheaper methods, such as humans in dinosaur suits and modern reptiles with dinosaur decorations, enlarged by cinematography.&lt;ref name="DFG97"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DL90"/&gt; Dinosaur depictions diversified in the 1930s, spreading to newspaper [[comic strip]]s in ''[[Alley Oop]]''&lt;ref name="DL90"&gt;{{cite book |last=Lambert |first=David |author2=the Diagram Group |title=The Dinosaur Data Book |year=1990 |publisher=Avon Books |location=New York |isbn=0-380-75896-2 |pages=290–301}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to advertising for [[Sinclair Oil]].&lt;ref name="DFG97"/&gt;

[[File:Rhedosaurus &amp; the lighthouse.png|thumb|left|Scene from ''[[The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms]]'' (1953).]]
The [[Great Depression]] and [[World War II]] combined to sink the study of dinosaurs into a decades-long lull.&lt;ref name="GSP00b"&gt;{{cite book |last=Paul |first=Gregory S. |authorlink=Gregory S.

''The Dinosaur Heresies'', 15–16.&lt;/ref&gt; Scientific dinosaur artwork, primarily from [[Rudolph F. Zallinger]] and [[Zdeněk Burian]], reflected and reinforced the conception of dinosaurs as slow and static (one artistic quirk that became commonplace in representations of [[Mesozoic]] landscapes, the presence of a [[volcano]], was a hallmark of Zallinger's).&lt;ref name="GSP00b"/&gt; From such ideas came the [[Synecdoche|alternate use]] of "dinosaur" as something out of date.&lt;ref name="m-w"&gt;"[http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/dinosaur Definition of dinosaur]" Merriam-Webster's Online Dictionary. Accessed 26 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Films of the time typically used dinosaurs as monsters, with the added element of atomic fears in the early [[Cold War]]. Thus, ''[[The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms]]'' (1953) and ''[[Godzilla (1954 film)|Godzilla]]'' (1954; American release 1956) portray monstrous dinosaur-like prehistoric reptiles that go on rampages after being awakened by [[atomic bomb]] tests.&lt;ref name="DFG97"/&gt;&lt;ref name="USAToday"&gt;{{cite news | last = Snider | first = Mike | title = Godzilla arouses atomic terror | work = USA Today | pages = | language = | publisher = Gannett Corporation | date = 2006-08-29 | url = https://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2006-08-28-godzilla-dvd_x.htm | accessdate = 2007-02-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An alternative appears in [[Disney]]'s animated ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]'' (1940), in its ''[[The Rite of Spring]]'' sequence, which attempted to portray dinosaurs with some scientific accuracy (although it has the common error of showing prehistoric animals from many different time periods living at the same time)&lt;ref name="DFG97"/&gt; and also in [[Karel Zeman]]'s ''[[Cesta do praveku]]'' (1955; ''Journey to the Beginning of Time''), a Czechoslovakian children's science fiction movie inspired by Zdeněk Burian's work.

In 1956, [[Oliver Butterworth]] authored a children's book, ''The Enormous Egg''. The book and a movie adaptation televised in 1968 by the [[NBC Children's Theatre]] tell the story of a boy who finds an enormous egg laid by a hen that hatches a baby ''[[Triceratops]]''. The dinosaur, named ''[[Uncle Beazley]]'', becomes too big, so the boy brings him to the [[Smithsonian Institution]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] Beazley is first kept at the [[National Museum of Natural History]], but is eventually transferred to the [[National Zoological Park (United States)|National Zoo]]'s Elephant House because there is a law against stabling large animals in the District of Columbia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Butterworth|first=Oliver, illustrated by Louis Darling|author-link=Oliver Butterworth|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wtIa1N0-Z78C|title=The Enormous Egg|location=Boston, Massachusetts|publisher=Little, Brown and Co.|year=1956|isbn=0-590-47546-0|oclc=299175|accessdate=July 4, 2016}}&lt;br&gt;(2) {{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120831191835/http://www.scholastic.com/teachers/book/enormous-egg|archivedate=July 31, 2012|url=http://www.scholastic.com/teachers/book/enormous-egg|title=About this book|work=The Enormous Egg by Oliver Butterworth, illustrated by Louis Darling|publisher=Scholastic Inc.|year=2016|accessdate=July 3, 2016|quote=At first Nate doesn't see what all the fuss is all about.

Dinosaurs gained a home in [[television]] in the 1960s animated [[sitcom]] ''[[The Flintstones]]'', in another example of dinosaurs shown as coexisting with humans (for comedic effect in this case).&lt;ref name="DL90"/&gt; Dinosaurs also entered [[comic book]]s in this period in such series as ''[[Tor (comic book)|Tor]]'' and ''[[Turok, Son of Stone]]'', where prehistoric humans fought anachronistic dinosaurs. For those wanting more scientific accounts of dinosaurs, there were the first nontechnical dinosaur books. [[Edwin Harris Colbert|Ned Colbert]]'s ''The Dinosaur Book'' (1945) was the first such book, and its status as the only such book for many years made Colbert an important figure for the coming generations of paleontologists and dinosaur enthusiasts.&lt;ref name="DFG97"/&gt;

In the 1960s, paleontologist [[John Ostrom]] began work on the [[theropod]] ''[[Deinonychus]]''.&lt;ref name="ostrom1969"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ostrom|first=J. H.|year=1969|title=Osteology of ''Deinonychus antirrhopus'', an unusual theropod from the Lower Cretaceous of Montana |journal=Peabody Museum of Natural History Bulletin |volume=30 |pages=1–165| oclc=679420 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His findings, which were expanded upon by his student [[Robert T. Bakker]], contributed to the [[Dinosaur Renaissance]],&lt;ref&gt;The term has entered into common usage after an article of the same name by paleontologist [[Robert T. Bakker]] in ''Scientific American'', in April 1975. Examples can be found [http://www.citypaper.com/news/story.asp?id=11282 here] and [http://www.geotimes.org/jan06/feature_threedinofaces.html here].&lt;/ref&gt; a [[scientific revolution|revolution]] in the study of dinosaurs. Of particular importance were a reevaluation of the [[origin of birds]] that showed them to be closely related to [[coelurosauria]]n dinosaurs,&lt;ref name="JO74"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ostrom |first=John |authorlink=John Ostrom |year=1974 |title=''Archaeopteryx'' and the origin of flight |journal=The Quarterly Review of Biology |volume=49 |issue=1 |doi=10.1086/407902 |pages=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; reappraisal of [[physiology of dinosaurs|dinosaur physiology]] that suggested they weren't the sluggish [[Poikilotherm|cold-blooded]] animals they'd long been assumed to be,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bakker |first=Robert T. |authorlink=Robert T.

Soon thereafter came new evidence on dinosaur social behavior, with nests of ''[[Maiasaura]]'' suggesting parental care.&lt;ref name="JM79"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Horner |first=John R. |authorlink=Jack Horner (paleontologist) |author2=Makela, Robert |year=1979 |title=Nest of juveniles provides evidence of family-structure among dinosaurs |journal=Nature |volume=282 |issue=5736 |pages=296–298|doi=10.1038/282296a0 |bibcode=1979Natur.282..296H}}&lt;/ref&gt; These findings were reflected in the work of a new generation of paleoartists. One milestone was Sarah Landry's [[feathered dinosaur]] in Bakker's 1975 ''[[Scientific American]]'' article, ''Dinosaur Renaissance''.&lt;ref name="GSP00b"/&gt;

[[Louis Paul Jonas]] created the first full sized dinosaur sculptures for the [[1964 New York World's Fair]] in the "Dinoland" area, which was sponsored by the [[Sinclair Oil Corporation]], whose [[logo]] featured a dinosaur. Jonas consulted with paleontologists [[Barnum Brown]], [[Edwin H. Colbert]] and John Ostrom in order to create nine sculptures that were as accurate as possible. After the Fair closed, the dinosaur models toured the country on flatbed trailers as part of a company advertising campaign.

In 1967, the Sinclair Oil Corporation gave one of its dinosaurs, a fiberglass model of a ''Triceratops'', to the Smithsonian Institution. The model, which appeared in ''The Enormous Egg'' television movie in 1968 as ''Uncle Beazley'', is now on display at the National Zoo in [[Washington, D.C.]] From the 1970s to 1994, the statue was located on the [[National Mall]] in front of the National Museum of Natural History.&lt;ref&gt;(1) {{cite book|first=James M.|last=Goode|title=Uncle Beazley|work=The Outdoor Sculpture of Washington, D.C.: A Comprehensive Historical Guide|location=Washington, D.C.|publisher=Smithsonian Institution Press|year=1974|page=260|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nXLqAAAAMAAJ|isbn=978-0-88103-233-8|oclc=2610663|accessdate=2016-07-04|quote=This 25-foot long replica of a Triceratops&amp;nbsp;... was placed on the Mall in 1967.&amp;nbsp;... &lt;br&gt;The full-size Triceratops replica and eight other types of dinosaurs were designed by two prominent paleontologists, Dr. Barnum Brown of the American Museum of Natural History, in New York City, and Dr. John Ostrom of the Peabody Museum, in Peabody, Massachusetts. The sculptor, Louis Paul Jonas, executed these prehistoric animals in fiberglass, after the designs of Barnum and Ostrom, for the Sinclair Refining Company's Pavilion at the New York World's Fair of 1964. After the Fair closed, the nine dinosaurs, which weighed between 2 and 4 tons each, were placed on trucks and taken on a tour of the eastern United States. The Sinclair Refining Company promoted the tour for public relations and advertising purposes, since their trademark was the dinosaur. In 1967, the nine dinosaurs were given to various American museums.&lt;br&gt;This particular replica was used for the filming of ''The Enormous Egg'', a movie made by the [[National Broadcasting Company]] for television, based on a children's book of the same name by Oliver Buttersworth.

===The 1980s to the present: Dinosaurs reconsidered===
[[File:Changing-image-of-Iguanodon.jpg|thumb|left|Outdated and modern reconstructions of ''[[Iguanodon]]''.]] 
The reevaluation of dinosaurs spurred public interest, with the new generation of paleoartists quick to respond. Artists such as [[Mark Hallett (artist)|Mark Hallett]], [[Doug Henderson (artist)|Doug Henderson]], [[John Gurche]], [[Gregory S. Paul]], [[William Stout]], and Bob Walters illustrated the new findings in response to the demand.&lt;ref name="GSP00b"/&gt;

By the latter half of the 1980s and into the 1990s, other media were showing the influence of the increased popularity, with diverse depictions aimed at a variety of ages and interests.

For preschoolers, there was the educational television show ''[[Barney &amp; Friends]]'' starting in 1992; their older siblings had the 1988 animated movie ''[[The Land Before Time]]'' and its [[The Land Before Time (series)|increasing line]] of [[direct to video]] [[sequel]]s (13 by 2016). ''[[Dinosaurs (TV series)|Dinosaurs]]'', a television sitcom, parodied humans and other television shows. Of particular note is [[Michael Crichton]]'s 1990 novel, ''[[Jurassic Park (novel)|Jurassic Park]]'', the popularity of which led to a [[Jurassic Park franchise|series of films and other media]]. The first of these, ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]'', married advanced [[computer-generated imagery|CGI]]&lt;ref name="DFG97"/&gt; with advances in scientific knowledge of dinosaurs.&lt;ref name="SGL00"&gt;{{cite book | last=Lucas |first=Spencer G. |authorlink=Spencer G.

The falling cost of computer-generated effects also has recently allowed the increased production of documentaries for television; the award-winning 1999 [[BBC]] series ''[[Walking with Dinosaurs]]'', the 2001 ''[[When Dinosaurs Roamed America]]'', the 2003 ''[[Dinosaur Planet (TV series)|Dinosaur Planet]]'', the 2009 ''[[Animal Armageddon]]'', and the 2011 ''[[Planet dinosaur|Planet Dinosaur]]'' are notable examples.

==Public perception of dinosaurs==
[[File:WJT2005-RZ-Dino-vor-Dom.jpg|thumb|Sculpture of [[tyrannosaurid]] and sheep (10 meters long and 4 meters tall) as anticlerical propaganda]] 
The popular ideals of dinosaurs have many [[common misconceptions|misconceptions]], reinforced by films, books, comics, television shows, and even [[Dinosaur World (theme parks)|theme parks]]. Typical errors include: prehistoric humans living with dinosaurs; dinosaurs as monsters that did little else but fight;&lt;ref name="DFG97"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SGL00"/&gt; the portrayal of a kind of "prehistoric world" where all prehistoric animals are shown to exist;&lt;ref name="DFG97"/&gt; dinosaurs as all large; dinosaurs as stupid and slow-moving; dinosaurs as being [[lizard]]-like and all scaled (non-[[feather]]ed) when many [[theropod dinosaurs]] such as ''[[Velociraptor]]'' had [[feathered dinosaur|feathers]], and the inclusion of many prehistoric animals (such as ''[[Dimetrodon]]'', [[ichthyosaur]]s, [[mosasaur]]s, [[pterosaur]]s, and [[plesiosaur]]s) as dinosaurs;&lt;ref name="DL90"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SGL00"/&gt; Moreover, dinosaurs did not become extinct due to being generally maladapted or unable to cope with normal climatic change, a view found in many older textbooks.&lt;ref name="MacLeod"&gt;{{cite journal|author=MacLeod, N. |author2=Rawson, P.

Reports in the news media of dinosaur finds and dinosaur science are often inaccurate and sensationalistic, and popular dinosaur books usually lag&lt;!--lag, "postdate," not lack, "not have"--&gt; scientific understanding.&lt;ref name="SGL00"/&gt; Dinosaur [[toy]]s and models are often inaccurate, packaged indiscriminately with other prehistoric animals,&lt;ref name="SGL00"/&gt; or have fictitious additions like the large sharp teeth in some [[rubber]] ''[[Triceratops]]'' toys.&lt;ref name="DFG97"/&gt;

The pejorative use of "dinosaur" as something behind the times has been applied to people, styles, and ideas that are perceived to be out of date, and on the wane.&lt;ref name="dictionary"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=dinosaur |title=dinosaur|work=Dictionary.com|publisher=Lexico Publishing Group, LLC |accessdate=2008-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, members of the [[punk rock|punk]] movement derided the "[[progressive rock|progressive]]" bands that preceded them as "dinosaur bands".&lt;ref name="PB04"&gt;{{cite book |last=Bussy |first=Pascal |year=2004 |title=Kraftwerk: Man, Machine, and Music |publisher=SAF Publishing Ltd |edition=Revised Updated |location= |isbn=0-946719-70-5|page=87 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, some popular depictors have striven for accuracy and presented up-to-date information; Michael Crichton&lt;ref name="SGL00"/&gt; and [[Bill Watterson]] (of ''[[Calvin and Hobbes]]'')&lt;ref name="FBS97"&gt;Farlow, James O. and Brett-Surman, Michael K. ''The Complete Dinosaur'', Plate 22.&lt;/ref&gt; are two recent examples. Paleoartists and illustrators in particular have kept up with research. Popular conceptions of dinosaurs have also been important in stimulating the interest and imagination of young people, and have been responsible for introducing many who would later become paleontologists to the field. In addition, popular depictions have the freedom to be more imaginative and speculative than technical works.&lt;ref name="WAS01"/&gt;

===Usage===
The typical use of dinosaurs in popular culture has been as vicious monsters.&lt;ref name="DFG97"/&gt; There are several distinct genres of dinosaur depictions commonly used: "lost worlds" on modern Earth; [[time travel]] stories; educational works for children;&lt;ref name="WAS01"/&gt; prehistoric world stories (often with cavemen);&lt;ref name="SGL00"/&gt; and dinosaurs running amok in the modern world.&lt;ref name="DL90"/&gt;

===Appeal===
The appeal of dinosaurs, as suggested by author, researcher, and dinosaur enthusiast [[Donald F. Glut]], has multiple factors. Dinosaurs were "monsters," yet are safely extinct, allowing for vicarious thrills. They appeal to the imagination, and there are many ways to approach them intellectually. Finally, they appeal to adults nostalgic for what they enjoyed as children. Children have been particularly drawn to dinosaurs over the years.&lt;ref name="DFG97"/&gt;

{{Unreferenced|date=March 2011}}
A '''double concerto''' (Italian: ''Doppio concerto''; German: ''Doppelkonzert'') refers to two distinct variations on the [[concerto]]. Most often, it refers to a concerto featuring two performers, as opposed to the usual single performer, in the [[Solo (music)|solo]] role. These two performers' instruments may be of the same type, as in [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]]'s, [[Concerto for Two Violins (Bach)|Concerto for Two Violins]], or different, as in [[Johannes Brahms|Brahms]]'s [[Double Concerto (Brahms)|Concerto for Violin, Cello and Orchestra]]. 

The term may also be used to refer to the use of a double orchestral body where the work is in [[concerto grosso]] form; for example, [[Bohuslav Martinů|Martinů]]'s ''[[Double Concerto for Two String Orchestras, Piano, and Timpani (Martinů)|Double Concerto for Two String Orchestras, Piano, and Timpani]]'' is commonly known by the title "Double Concerto," where the word "double" refers to the two string bodies rather than to the piano and timpani who are not soloists in the conventional sense.

==Triple concerto==
Concerti with more than two solo parts may be known by the terms "triple concerto" (Italian: ''Concerto triplo'', German: ''Tripelkonzert''), "quadruple concerto," etc., but not usually when the instruments of the same type (e.g., [[Antonio Vivaldi|Vivaldi]]'s Concerto for Four Violins in B minor, catalogued as RV 580 and transcribed for four harpsichords by Bach as BWV 1065). 

One common arrangement for a triple concerto is for violin, cello, and piano, [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s [[Triple Concerto (Beethoven)|Triple Concerto for Violin, Cello, Piano and Orchestra]] being perhaps the most notable, but there have been many; see the [[list of triple concertos for violin, cello, and piano]].

'''Etiquette''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɛ|t|ᵻ|ˌ|k|ɛ|t}} or {{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɛ|t|ᵻ|k|ᵻ|t}}, {{IPA-fr|e.ti.kɛt|lang}}) is a [[Ethical code|code of behavior]] that delineates expectations for [[social behavior]] according to contemporary [[Convention (norm)|conventional]] [[Norm (sociology)|norms]] within a [[society]], [[social class]], or [[Group (sociology)|group]].

The French word ''[[wikt:étiquette|étiquette]]'', literally signifying a tag or label, was used in a modern sense in English around 1750.&lt;ref&gt;''[[OED]]'', "Etiquette".&lt;/ref&gt; Etiquette is behaviour that assists survival and has changed and evolved over the years.

==History==
[[File:Zuidgevel Corps de logis rond 1675 Anonieme schilder.jpg|thumb|[[Louis XIV]]'s court at the [[Palace of Versailles]] developed an elaborate form of etiquette.]]

In the 3rd millennium BC, [[Ptahhotep]] wrote ''[[The Maxims of Ptahhotep]]''. The Maxims were conformist precepts extolling such civil virtues as truthfulness, self-control and kindness towards one's fellow beings. Learning by listening to everybody and knowing that human knowledge is never perfect are a [[leitmotif]]. Avoiding open conflict wherever possible should not be considered weakness. Stress is placed on the pursuit of [[justice]], although it is conceded that it is a god's command that prevails in the end. Some of the maxims refer to one's behaviour when in the presence of the great, how to choose the right master and how to serve him. Others teach the correct way to lead through openness and kindness. Greed is the base of all evil and should be guarded against, while generosity towards family and friends is deemed praiseworthy.

[[Confucius]] (551–479 BC) was a Chinese teacher, editor, politician, and philosopher whose philosophy emphasized personal and governmental morality, correctness of social relationships, justice and sincerity.

[[Baldassare Castiglione]] (Italian: [baldasˈsaːre kastiʎˈʎoːne]; December 6, 1478 – February 2, 1529), count of Casatico, was an Italian courtier, diplomat, soldier and a prominent Renaissance author, who is probably most famous for his authorship of The Book of the Courtier. The work was an example of a courtesy book, dealing with questions of the etiquette and morality of the courtier, and was very influential in 16th century European court circles.

[[Louis XIV]] (1638–1718) "transformed a royal hunting lodge in [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]], a village 25 miles southwest of the capital, into one of the largest palaces in the world, officially moving his court and government there in 1682. It was against this awe-inspiring backdrop that Louis tamed the [[nobility]] and impressed foreign dignitaries, using entertainment, ceremony and a highly codified system of etiquette to assert his supremacy.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/topics/louis-xiv|title=Louis XIV|publisher=[[History.com]]|accessdate=December 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Politeness===
{{Main article|Politeness}}
[[File:Joseph Highmore - A Club of Gentlemen - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|Members of a [[Gentlemen's club]] had to conform to a socially acceptable standard of politeness. The painting, ''A Club of Gentlemen'' by [[Joseph Highmore]] c. 1730.]]

During the [[Enlightenment era]], a self-conscious process of the imposition of polite norms and behaviours became a symbol of being a genteel member of the upper class. Upwardly mobile [[middle class]] [[bourgeoisie]] increasingly tried to identify themselves with the elite through their adopted artistic preferences and their standards of behaviour. They became preoccupied with precise rules of etiquette, such as when to show [[emotion]], the art of elegant dress and graceful conversation and how to act courteously, especially with women. Influential in this new discourse was a series of essays on the nature of politeness in a commercial society, penned by the philosopher [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 3rd Earl of Shaftesbury|Lord Shaftesbury]] in the early 18th century. Shaftesbury defined politeness as the art of being pleasing in company:
:'Politeness' may be defined a dext'rous management of our words and actions, whereby we make other people have better opinion of us and themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The Third Earl of Shaftesbury and the Progress of Politeness|jstor = 2738536}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Periodicals, such as ''[[The Spectator (1711)|The Spectator]]'', founded as a daily publication by [[Joseph Addison]] and [[Richard Steele]] in 1711, gave regular advice to its readers on how to conform to the etiquette required of a polite gentleman. Its stated goal was "to enliven morality with wit, and to temper wit with morality... to bring philosophy out of the closets and libraries, schools and colleges, to dwell in clubs and assemblies, at tea-tables and coffeehouses" It provided its readers with educated, topical talking points, and advice in how to carry on conversations and social interactions in a polite manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.information-britain.co.uk/famdates.php?id=888|title=Information Britain|publisher=|accessdate=13 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The allied notion of 'civility' – referring to a desired social interaction which valued sober and reasoned debate on matters of interest – also became an important quality for the 'polite classes'.&lt;ref&gt;Cowan, 2005. p. 101&lt;/ref&gt; Established rules and procedures for proper behaviour as well as etiquette conventions, were outlined by [[gentlemen's club]]s, such as Harrington's Rota Club. Periodicals, including ''[[Tatler (1709)|The Tatler]]'' and ''[[The Spectator (1711)|The Spectator]]'', infused politeness into English coffeehouse conversation, as their explicit purpose lay in the reformation of English manners and morals.&lt;ref name="Mackie, 1998. p 1"&gt;Mackie, 1998. p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; Etiquette is the virtue of morality and code of behaviour.

[[Image:Philip Dormer Stanhope, 4th Earl of Chesterfield by William Hoare.jpg|thumb|left|[[Philip Stanhope, 4th Earl of Chesterfield|The Earl of Chesterfield]] invented the term 'etiquette' in the mid-18th century. Painting by [[William Hoare]].]]
It was [[Philip Stanhope, 4th Earl of Chesterfield]] who first used the word 'etiquette' in its modern meaning, in his ''Letters to His Son on the Art of Becoming a Man of the World and a Gentleman''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=de&amp;tbo=p&amp;tbm=bks&amp;q=isbn:1848546661 |title=Sorry! The English and Their Manners |author=Henry Hitchings |year=2013 |publisher=Hachette UK |accessdate=2013-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; This work comprised over 400 letters written from 1737 or 1738 and continuing until his son's death in 1768, and were mostly instructive letters on various subjects.&lt;ref&gt;Mayo, Christopher. "Letters To His Son". The Literary Encyclopedia. First published 25 February 2007 [http://www.litencyc.com/php/sworks.php?rec=true&amp;UID=21002, accessed 30 November 2011.]&lt;/ref&gt; The letters were first published by his son's widow [[Eugenia Stanhope]] in 1774. Chesterfield endeavoured to decouple the issue of manners from conventional morality, arguing that mastery of etiquette was an important weapon for social advancement. The Letters were full of elegant wisdom and perceptive observation and deduction. Chesterfield epitomised the restraint of polite 18th-century society, writing, for instance, in 1748:
{{quote|
I would heartily wish that you may often be seen to smile, but never heard to laugh while you live. Frequent and loud laughter is the characteristic of folly and ill-manners; it is the manner in which the mob express their silly joy at silly things; and they call it being merry. In my mind there is nothing so illiberal, and so ill-bred, as audible laughter. I am neither of a melancholy nor a cynical disposition, and am as willing and as apt to be pleased as anybody; but I am sure that since I have had the full use of my reason nobody has ever heard me laugh.
}}

By the [[Victorian era]], etiquette had developed into an exceptionally complicated system of rules, governing everything from the proper method for writing letters and using [[cutlery]] to the minutely regulated interactions between different classes and gender.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |author="Tudor Rose" |title=Victorian Society |publisher=AboutBritain.com |date=1999–2010 |url=http://www.aboutbritain.com/articles/victorian-society.asp |accessdate=August 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Manners==
[[File:High-Change-in-Bond-Street-Gillray.jpeg|thumb|In ''High-Change in Bond Street,—ou—la Politesse du Grande Monde'' (1796), [[James Gillray]] caricatured the lack of etiquette in a group of men leering at women and crowding them off a pavement.]]

Manners are described as good or bad to indicate whether or not a behavior is socially acceptable. Every culture adheres to a different set of manners, although a lot of manners are cross-culturally common. Manners are a subset of social norms which are informally enforced through self-regulation and social policing and publicly performed. They enable human ‘ultrasociality’ &lt;ref&gt;Richerson and Boyd, [http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/boyd/ultra.pdf "The Evolution of Human Ultra Sociality"], ''In press: I. Eibl-Eibisfeldt and F. Salter, eds. Ideology, Warfare, and Indoctrinability'', 1997&lt;/ref&gt; by imposing self-restraint and compromise on regular, everyday actions.

=== Sociology perspectives===
In his book [[The Civilizing Process]], [[Norbert Elias]] &lt;ref&gt;Norbert Elias, [http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/boyd/ultra.pdfhttp://www.norberteliasfoundation.nl/ "The Civilizing Process"], ''Oxford Blackwell Publishers'', 1994&lt;/ref&gt; argued that manners arose as a product of group living and persist as a way of maintaining social order.  He theorized that manners proliferated during the [[Renaissance]] in response to the development of the ‘absolute state’ – the progression from small group living to the centralization of power by the state. Elias believed that the rituals associated with manners in the Court Society of England during this period were closely bound with social status. To him, manners demonstrate an individual’s position within a social network and act as a means by which the individual can negotiate that position.

Petersen and Lupton argue that manners helped reduce the boundaries between the [[public sphere]] and the [[private sphere]] and gave rise to ''“a highly reflective self, a self who monitors his or her behavior with due regard for others with whom he or she interacts socially.”'' They explain that; ''“The public behavior of ''individuals came to signify their social standing, a means of presenting the self and of evaluating others and thus the control of the outward self was''
''vital.”'' &lt;ref&gt;Petersen A., Lupton D., [https://books.google.com/books/about/The_New_Public_Health.html?id=RofiHHQddx0C "The Healthy Citizen"], in The New Public Health – Discourses, Knowledges,
Strategies, ''London, SAGE'', 1996&lt;/ref&gt; From this perspective, manners are seen not just as a means of displaying one’s [[social status]], but also as a
means of  maintaining social
boundaries relative to class and identity.

[[Pierre Bourdieu]]’s notion of ''‘[[Habitus (sociology)|habitus]]’'' can also contribute to the understanding of manners.&lt;ref&gt;Bourdieu P., [http://ebooks.cambridge.org/ebook.jsf?bid=CBO9780511812507 "Outline of a Theory of Practice], ''Cambridge, Cambridge University Press'', 1977&lt;/ref&gt; The habitus, he explains, is a set of ''‘dispositions’'' that are
neither self-determined, nor pre-determined, by external environmental factors. They tend to operate at a subconscious level and are ''“inculcated through experience and explicit teaching”'' &lt;ref&gt;Jenkins R., [https://books.google.com/books/about/Pierre_Bourdieu.html?id=aPVaHgUx1f0C "Pierre Bourdieu (Key Sociologists)], ''Cornwall, Routledge'', 2002&lt;/ref&gt; and produced and reproduced by social interactions. Manners, in this view, are likely to be a central part of the ''‘dispositions’'' which guide an individual’s ability to make socially compliant behavioral decisions.

===Anthropology perspectives===
Anthropologists concern themselves primarily with detailing cultural variances and differences in ''‘ways of seeing’.''  Theorists such as [[Mary Douglas]] have
claimed that each culture’s unique set of manners, behaviors and rituals enable the local cosmology to remain ordered and free from those things that may pollute or
defile it.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas M., [http://www.bc.edu/bc_org/avp/cas/his/schloesser/HS041-042/fall/w04/resources/DOUGLAS_Purity-Danger.pdf "Purity and Danger – An Analysis of Concepts of Pollution and Taboo] ''London, Routledge'', 2003&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, she suggests that ideas of pollution and disgust are attached to the margins of socially acceptable behavior to curtail such actions and
maintain''“ the assumptions by which experience is controlled.”''

=== Evolutionary biology perspectives===
Evolutionary biology looks at the origin of  behavior and the motivation behind it. [[Charles Darwin]] analyzed the remarkable universality of facial responses to [[disgust]], [[shame]] and other complex emotions.&lt;ref&gt;Darwin C., [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?pageseq=1&amp;itemID=F1142&amp;viewtype=text ''The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals''] London, Penguin, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Having identified the same behavior in young infants and blind individuals he concluded that these responses are not learned but innate. According to [[Val Curtis]],&lt;ref&gt;Curtis V.,[http://ukcatalogue.oup.com/product/9780199579488.do#.Ul6c1BAwK8A ''Don’t Look, Don't Touch – The Science Behind Revulsion''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140728230238/http://ukcatalogue.oup.com/product/9780199579488.do |date=2014-07-28 }} Oxford, Oxford University Press, 2013&lt;br&gt;Curtis V. Aunger R, Rabie T.,[http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/271/Suppl_4/S131.abstract "Evidence that disgust evolved to protect from risk of disease] ''Royal Society B: Biological Sciences'', '''271 Suppl''': S131–33., 2004&lt;/ref&gt; the development of these responses was concomitant with the development of manners behavior. For Curtis, manners play an evolutionary role in the prevention of [[disease]]. This assumes that those who were hygienic, polite to others and most able to benefit from their membership within a cultural group, stand the best
chance of survival and reproduction.

Catherine Cottrell and [[Steven Neuberg]] explore how our behavioral responses to ‘otherness’ may enable the preservation of manners and norms.&lt;ref name="Evolutionary Bases of Prejudices"&gt;Neuberg SL., Cottrell CA.,[https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=aJe9fLi8pW0C&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA163&amp;dq=%28Cottrell+%26+Neuberg+2005%29.+evolutionary+bases+of+prejudice&amp;ots=RKGAer-6uw&amp;sig=nDTy2QDmZca9l36r9D3vs9idnQQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%28Cottrell%20%26%20Neuberg%202005%29.%20evolutionary%20bases%20of%20prejudice&amp;f=false "Evolutionary Bases of Prejudices"] in Schaller M. et al., ed. ''Evolution and Social Psychology''. New York, Psychology Press, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; They suggest that the foreignness or unfamiliarity we experience when interacting with different cultural groups for the first time, may partly serve an evolutionary function: ''“Group living surrounds one with individuals able to physically harm fellow group members, to spread contagious disease, or to “free ride” on their efforts. A commitment to sociality thus carries a risk: If threats such as these are left unchecked, the costs of sociality will quickly exceed its benefits. Thus, to maximize the returns on group ''living, individual group members should be attuned to others’ features or behaviors.”''&lt;ref name="Evolutionary Bases of Prejudices"/&gt;

Thus, people who possess similar traits, common to the group, are to be trusted, whereas those who do not are to be considered as ‘others’ and treated with suspicion or even exclusion. Curtis argues that selective pressure borne out of a shift towards [[communal living]] would have resulted in individuals being shunned from the group for hygiene lapses or uncooperative behavior. This would have led to people avoiding actions that might result in embarrassment or others being disgusted.&lt;ref name="ukcatalogue.oup.com"&gt;Curtis V.,[http://ukcatalogue.oup.com/product/9780199579488.do#.Ul6c1BAwK8A "Don’t Look, Don't Touch – The Science Behind Revulsion"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140728230238/http://ukcatalogue.oup.com/product/9780199579488.do |date=2014-07-28 }} Oxford, Oxford University Press, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joseph Henrich]] and [[Robert Boyd (anthropologist)|Robert Boyd]] developed a
model to demonstrate this process at work. They explain [[natural selection]] has favored the acquisition of genetically transmitted learning mechanisms that increase an individual’s chance of acquiring locally adaptive behavior. They hypothesize that: ''“Humans possess a reliably developing neural encoding that compels them both to punish individuals who violate group norms (common beliefs or practices) and punish individuals who do not punish norm violators.”''&lt;ref&gt;Henrich J, Boyd R., [http://www.ehbonline.org/article/S1090-5138%2898%2900018-X/abstract "The Evolution of Conformist Transmission and the Emergence of Between Group Differences"]''Evolution and Human Behavior'', '''19(4)''':215–41, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; From this approach, manners are a means of mitigating undesirable behavior and fostering the benefits of in-group cooperation.

===Types===
Curtis also specifically outlines three manner categories; [[hygiene]], [[courtesy]] and cultural [[Norm (social)|norms]], each of which help to account for the multifaceted role manners play in society.&lt;ref name="ukcatalogue.oup.com"/&gt;
These categories are based on the outcome rather than the motivation of manners behavior and individual manner behaviors may fit into 2 or more categories.

'''Hygiene Manners''' – are any manners which affect [[disease transmission]]. They are likely to be taught at an early age, primarily through parental discipline, positive behavioral
enforcement of continence with bodily fluids (such as toilet training), and the avoidance or removal of items that pose a disease risk for children. It is expected that,
by adulthood, hygiene manners are so entrenched in one’s behavior that they become second nature.  Violations are likely to elicit [[disgust]] responses.

'''Courtesy Manners''' – demonstrate one’s ability to put the interests of others before oneself; to display self-control and good intent for the purposes of being trusted
in social interactions. Courtesy manners help to maximize the benefits of group living by regulating social interaction. Disease avoidance behavior can sometimes be compromised in the performance of courtesy manners. They may be taught in the same way as hygiene manners but are likely to also be learned through direct,
indirect (i.e. observing the interactions of others) or imagined (i.e. through the [[executive functions]] of the brain) social interactions. The learning of courtesy manners may take place
at an older age than hygiene manners, because individuals must have at least some means of communication and some awareness of self and social positioning.
The violation of courtesy manners most commonly results in social disapproval from peers.

'''Cultural Norm Manners''' – typically demonstrate one’s [[Identity (social science)|identity]] within a specific socio-cultural group. Adherence to cultural norm manners allows for the demarcation of socio-cultural identities and the creation of boundaries which inform who is to be trusted or who is to be deemed as ‘other’. Cultural norm manners are learnt through the enculturation and routinisation of ‘the familiar’ and through exposure to ‘otherness’ or those who are identified as foreign or different. Transgressions and non-adherence to cultural norm manners commonly result in [[Social alienation|alienation]]. Cultural norms, by their very nature, have a high level of between-group variability but are likely to be common to all those who identify with a given group identity.

Rules of etiquette encompass most aspects of social interaction in any society, though the term itself is not commonly used. A rule of etiquette may reflect an underlying [[ethical code]], or it may reflect a person's [[fashion]] or [[Social status|status]]. Rules of etiquette are usually unwritten, but aspects of etiquette have been codified from time to time.

===Books===
[[Baldassare Castiglione]] was an Italian courtier, diplomat, soldier and a prominent Renaissance author, who is probably most famous for his authorship of The Book of the Courtier. The work was an example of a courtesy book, dealing with questions of the etiquette and morality of the courtier, and was very influential in 16th century European court circles.

[[Erasmus]] of Rotterdam published his book ''On Good Manners for Boys'' in 1530. Amid his advice for young children on [[fidgeting]], [[yawning]], bickering and scratching he highlights that a core tenet of manners is the ability to “''readily ignore the faults of others but avoid falling short yourself''”.&lt;ref&gt;Rotterdam, E. of. (1536). ''A Handbook on Good Manners for Children: De Civilitate Morum Puerilium Libellus''. (E. Merchant, Ed.) (English tr.). London: Preface Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;

In centuries since then, many authors have tried to collate manners or etiquette guide books. One of the most famous of these was [[Emily Post]] who began to document etiquette in 1922. She described her work as detailing the “''trivialities''” of desirable everyday conduct but also provided descriptions of appropriate conduct for key life events such as [[baptism]]s, [[wedding]]s and [[funeral]]s. She later established an institute which continues to provide updated advice on how to negotiate modern day society with good manners and decorum.

===Western office and business===
The etiquette of business is the set of written and unwritten rules of conduct that make social interactions run more smoothly. Office etiquette in particular applies to coworker interaction, excluding interactions with external contacts such as customers and suppliers. When conducting group meetings in the United States, the assembly might follow ''[[Robert's Rules of Order]]'', if there are no other company policies to control a meeting.

These rules are often echoed throughout an industry or economy. For instance, 49% of employers surveyed in 2005 by the American National Association of Colleges and Employers found that non-traditional attire would be a "strong influence" on their opinion of a potential job candidate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |volume=50 |number=3 |title=Blue hair, body piercings--do employers care? |work=Grab Bag |publisher=Occupational Outlook Quarterly |date=Fall 2006 |url=http://stats.bls.gov/opub/ooq/2006/fall/grabbag.htm#B |accessdate=August 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Business Etiquette at companies such as [[IBM]] influence global business etiquette and professional standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sherman|first1=Joseph J|title=How they did it: Sharon Hill|url=http://simplebooklet.com/publish.php?wpKey=JWi8pGQwRiArQNq8XrLfwd#page=72|work=FYI Magazine|issue=August|date=2015|quote=Sharon was a rising start at IBM.

Sharon explains “My worldwide success, customer loyalty, and employee praise meant nothing. My department was cut and it was time to decide what I would do next in my life. That’s when I decided to follow my passion and start my own company. I got certified as an Etiquette trainer and was off and running. To this day, I thank IBM for teaching me professionalism and giving me the business acumen needed to start my business.”}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both office and business etiquette overlap considerably with basic tenets of [[netiquette]], the social conventions for using computer networks.

Business etiquette can vary significantly in different countries, which is invariably related to their culture. For example: A notable difference between Chinese and Western business etiquette is conflict handling.  Chinese businesses prefer to look upon relationship management to avoid conflicts&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |author="Ho-Ching Wei" |title=Chinese-Style Conflict Resolution: A Case of Taiwanese Business Immigrants in Australia |publisher=University of Western Sydney |url=http://www.uri.edu/iaics/content/2000v9n2/5%20Ho-Ching%20Wei.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091123080428/http://www.uri.edu/iaics/content/2000v9n2/5%20Ho-Ching%20Wei.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=November 23, 2009 |accessdate=June 2, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; – stemming from a culture that heavily relies on ''[[guanxi]]'' (personal connections) – while the west leaves resolution of conflict to the interpretations of law through contracts and lawyers.

Adjusting to foreign etiquettes is a major complement of [[culture shock]], providing a market for manuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=De Mente |first=Boyd |title=Chinese Etiquette &amp; Ethics in Business |publisher= NTC Business Books |location=Lincolnwood |year=1994 |isbn=0-8442-8524-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other resources include business and diplomacy institutions, available only in certain countries such as the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title= Institute of Diplomacy and Business  |url=http://www.diplomacyandbusiness.com/ |accessdate=June 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, a group of etiquette experts and international business group formed a non-profit organization called IITTI (pronounced as "''ET''") to help human resource (HR) departments of multinationals in measuring the etiquette skills of prospective new employees during the recruitment process by standardizing image and etiquette examination, similar to what ISO does for industrial process measurements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iitti.org/about/about.htm|title=IITTI website "About Us"|publisher=|accessdate=13 September 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140913174240/http://www.iitti.org/about/about.htm|archivedate=13 September 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Etiquette in [[retail]] is sometimes summarized as "The customer is always right." {{quote|There are always two sides to the case, of course, and it is a credit to good manners that there is scarcely ever any friction in stores and shops of the first class. Salesmen and women are usually persons who are both patient and polite, and their customers are most often ladies in fact as well as "by courtesy." Between those before and those behind the counters, there has sprung up in many instances a relationship of mutual goodwill and friendliness. It is, in fact, only the woman who is afraid that someone may encroach upon her exceedingly insecure dignity, who shows neither courtesy nor consideration to any except those whom she considers it to her advantage to please.
[[Emily Post]] ''Etiquette'' 1922}}

==Cultural differences==
{{Refimprove section|date=November 2011}}
[[File:AndriesBothLicehunting.jpg|thumb|''Hunting Lice by Candlelight'', [[Andries Both]] (Dutch, c. 1612/13 – 1641)]]

Etiquette is dependent on [[culture]]; what is excellent etiquette in one society may shock another. Etiquette evolves within culture. The Dutch painter [[Andries Both]] shows that the hunt for [[head lice]] (''illustration, right''), which had been a civilized grooming occupation in the early Middle Ages, a bonding experience that reinforced the comparative rank of two people, one groomed the other, one was the subject of the groomer, had become a peasant occupation by 1630. The painter portrays the familiar operation matter-of-factly, without the disdain this subject would have received in a 19th-century representation.

Etiquette can vary widely between different cultures and nations. For example, in [[Hausa people|Hausa]] culture, eating while standing may be seen as offensively casual and ill-omened behavior, insulting the host and showing a lack of respect for the scarcity of food—the offense is known as "eating with the devil" or "committing ''santi''." In China, a person who takes the last item of food from a common plate or bowl without first offering it to others at the table may be seen as a glutton who is insulting the host's generosity. Traditionally, if guests do not have leftover food in front of them at the end of a meal, it is to the dishonour of the host. In the United States of America, a guest is expected to eat all of the food given to them, as a compliment to the quality of the cooking. However, it is still considered polite to offer food from a common plate or bowl to others at the table.

In such rigid hierarchal cultures as Korea and Japan, alcohol helps to break down the strict social barrier between classes. It allows for a hint of informality to creep in. It is traditional for host and guest to take turns filling each other's cups and encouraging each other to gulp it down. For someone who does not consume alcohol (except for religious reasons), it can be difficult escaping the ritual of the social drink.&lt;ref name="IBC"&gt;{{cite book |last=Mitchell |first=Charles |title=Short Course in International Business Culture |publisher=World Trade Press |location=San Rafael |year=1999 |isbn=1-885073-54-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Etiquette is a topic that has occupied writers and thinkers in all sophisticated societies for millennia, beginning with a behavior code by [[Ptahhotep]], a vizier in ancient Egypt's [[Old Kingdom]] during the reign of the Fifth Dynasty king [[Djedkare Isesi]] (c. 2414–2375 BC). All known literate civilizations, including ancient Greece and Rome, developed rules for proper social conduct. [[Confucius]] included rules for eating and speaking along with his more philosophical sayings.
[[File:High-change in Bond Street, - ou - la politesse du grande monde by James Gillray.jpg|thumb|High-change in Bond Street, - ou - la politesse du grande monde by James Gillray]]
[[Early modern]] conceptions of what behavior identifies a "[[gentleman]]" were codified in the 16th century, in a book by [[Baldassare Castiglione]], ''Il Cortegiano'' ("The Courtier"); its codification of expectations at the court of Urbino remained in force in its essentials until [[World War I]]. [[Louis XIV]] established an elaborate and rigid court ceremony, but distinguished himself from the high bourgeoisie by continuing to eat, stylishly and fastidiously, with his fingers. An important book about etiquette is ''[[Il Galateo]]'' by [[Giovanni della Casa]]; in fact, in [[Italian language|Italian]], etiquette is generally called ''galateo'' (or ''etichetta'' or ''protocollo'').

In the American colonies, [[Benjamin Franklin]] and [[George Washington]] wrote codes of conduct for young gentlemen. The immense popularity of advice columns and books by [[Letitia Baldrige]] and [[Judith Martin|Miss Manners]] shows the currency of this topic. Even more recently, the rise of the Internet has necessitated the adaptation of existing rules of conduct to create [[Netiquette]], which governs the drafting of e-mail, rules for participating in an online forum, and so on.

In Germany, many books dealing with etiquette, especially dining, dressing etc., are called ''the [[Knigge]]'', named after [[Adolph Freiherr Knigge]] who wrote the book ''Über den Umgang mit Menschen'' (''On Human Relations'') in the late 18th century. However, this book is about good manners and also about the social state of its time, but not about etiquette.

Etiquette may be wielded as a social weapon. The outward adoption of the superficial mannerisms of an in-group, in the interests of social advancement rather than a concern for others, is considered by many a form of [[snob]]bery, lacking in [[virtue]].

'''Fly-in fly-out''' is a method of employing people in remote areas by flying them temporarily to the work site instead of relocating employees and their families permanently. It is often abbreviated to '''FIFO''' when referring to employment status. This is common in large mining regions in Australia&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.com.au/rio-tinto-flies-former-gunns-workers-its-pilbara-mine-sites-1279346|title=Rio Tinto flies former Gunns workers to its Pilbara mine sites|publisher=[[International Business Times]]|date=18 March 2011|access-date=5 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.riotinto.com/australia/working-with-us-9668.aspx|title=Working with us|publisher=Rio Tinto|access-date=5 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Canada.

Similar to the fly-in fly-out roster is the '''DIDO''' [[Schedule (workplace)|roster]], drive-in drive-out, which has essentially the same benefits and negatives.&lt;ref name="Rio" /&gt;

==Overview==
Rather than relocating employees and their families to a town near the work site, the employees are flown to the work site, where they work for a number of days, and are then flown back to their hometowns for a number of days of rest.

Fly-in fly-out is very commonly used in the [[mining]] industry, as mines are often in areas far from towns. Employers prefer it when the cost of establishing permanent communities (of sufficient quality to attract families to live locally) will exceed the cost of airfares and temporary housing on the work site. Generally, such sites use [[portable buildings]] since there is no long-term commitment to that location (e.g., the mine will close once the minerals have been extracted).

Usually, a fly-in fly-out job involves working a long shift (e.g., 12 hours each day) for a number of continuous days with all days off spent at home rather than at the work site. As the employee's work days are almost entirely taken up by working, sleeping, and eating, there is little need for any recreation facilities at the work site. However, companies are increasingly offering facilities such as pools, tennis courts, and gyms as a way of attracting and retaining skilled staff. Employees like such arrangements since their families are often reluctant to relocate to small towns in remote areas where there might be limited opportunities for spouses' employment, limited educational choices for children, and poor recreational facilities.

==Psychological effects==
Fly-in fly-out employment can put stress on family relationships,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archive-date=29 May 2014|archive-url=http://archive.li/ndlYH|url=http://abc-for-kids.com/goldfields/stories/s574460.htm|title=Fly-in fly-out family study highlights domestic stress|publisher=ABC Goldfields-Esperance WA|date=5 June 2002|access-date=5 January 2018|author=Helen Wolfenden}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the phenomenon may stifle [[regional development]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Fly-in/Fly-out and Fly-over: Mining and regional development in Western Australia|journal=[[Australian Geographer]]|volume=32|first1=Keith|last1=Storey|issue=2|pages=133&amp;ndash;148|date=July 2001|doi=10.1080/00049180120066616}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Qld Inquiry"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-10-09/fifo--inquiry-recommends-more-local-workers-scrutiny-mines/6839924|title=FIFO inquiry calls for end to discrimination of local workers, higher scrutiny of mining operations|date=10 October 2012|access-date=5 January 2018|publisher=ABC|author=Alyse Edwards}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The impact of absent FIFO parents (primarily fathers) on their children and schooling has yet to be the subject of a major study, but it is likely that the separation anxiety experienced by the children of FIFO workers is similar to that of military families before, during and after deployment.  Research published in Australia in 2014 suggests that children of fly-in fly-out parents suffer emotionally from the parent's absence, more frequently become the targets of schoolyard bullying, and may evince additional bad behaviour.  However, such children often receive greater incentive to succeed academically, and some such children appreciate the extended time at home available for FIFO parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://aifs.gov.au/cfca/publications/fly-fly-out-workforce-practices-australia-effects/influence-contextual-factors|title=Fly-in fly-out workforce practices in Australia: The effects on children and family relationships, CFCA Paper No.19|date=1 February 2014|access-date=5 January 2018|publisher=Australian Institute of Family Studies|issue=CFCA Paper No.19|authors=Meredith, V., Rush, P. and Robinson, E.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://aifs.gov.au/cfca/bibliography/fly-fly-out-work-practices|title=Fly-in fly-out work practices|publisher=Australian Institute of Family Studies|access-date=5 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a high mental cost to the workers and their families, with several government inquiries into its detrimental effects.&lt;ref name="WA inquiry"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/fly-in-fly-out-works-high-price-counted-as/6554502|title=Fly-in fly-out work's high price counted as committee hands down findings on suicides|publisher=ABC 7.30 Report|date=17 June 2015|access-date=5 January 2018|author=Bronwyn Herbert}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-10-13/fifo-worker-suicides-register-to-be-established/6851964|title=FIFO suicide database to be established in WA; Industry mental health code rejected|publisher=ABC|date=13 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Australia==
A federal inquiry into fly-in fly-out and drive-in drive-out in Australia in 2012 found that it can lead to an increase in substance abuse, sexually transmitted infections, and [[Mental illness in fly-in fly-out workers|mental illness]] in workers on a FIFO roster, especially in Western Australia, where the number of people on such a roster is in excess of 50,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.watoday.com.au/wa-news/stis-spreading-doctors-forced-out-ama-warning-to-fifo-inquiry-20120417-1x4r5.html|title=STIs spreading, doctors forced out: AMA warning to FIFO inquiry|publisher=watoday.com.au|date=17 April 2012|access-date=5 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Queensland inquiry into the effects of fly-in fly-out was conducted in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://statedevelopment.qld.gov.au/industry-development/fifo.html|title=Fly-In-Fly-Out (FIFO) - government response|publisher=Queensland Department of State Development, Manufacturing, Infrastructure and Planning|access-date=5 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Qld Inquiry" /&gt;

In 2015, the Western Australian government instituted a support policy for FIFO workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.markmcgowan.com.au/files/Fly_In_Fly_Out_Support_Policy.pdf|title=Fly in-Fly Out Support|author=Mark McGowan|date=2017|access-date=5 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WA inquiry" /&gt;

Mining companies like [[Fortescue Metals Group]] estimate that it would cost the company an additional $100,000 per person per year to employ them in residential positions rather than as FIFO workers. In Port Hedland alone the company could save $33 million a year if it was to convert its 330-strong work force from residential to FIFO, the company estimates. The much higher cost of employing residential workers is caused by high real estate prices, slow release of land for residential development and high cost of living subsidies and forces mining companies to rely on FIFO rather than residential workers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/business/flyin-flyout-saves-millions-fortescue-tells-inquiry-20120417-1x5hy.html Fly-in fly-out saves millions, Fortescue tells inquiry] ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'', published: 18 April 2012, accessed: 21 August 2012&lt;/ref&gt;  Such a strategy has been employed in some mining towns that once had a considerable size.  For example, [[Wiluna, Western Australia|Wiluna]] in [[Western Australia]] had a population of 9,000 in 1938, but now has a population of 300, with almost all employees of the local mines on fly-in fly-out rosters.&lt;ref&gt;Garrick Moore: ''Mining Towns of Western Australia'', page: 93, accessed: 10 January 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Mining companies such as [[Rio Tinto Group|Rio Tinto]] have said that it is also the government's responsibility to deal with the side effects of fly-in fly-out, including housing shortages and the need to develop further infrastructure in the mining regions such as hospitals and schools to fulfil demand, as the Government highly benefits from increased tax and royalties income through the mining boom. Rio Tinto paid $5 billion in corporate tax and in excess of $2 billion in state royalties in 2011.&lt;ref name="Rio" &gt;[http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/mining-energy/rio-warns-against-fly-in-fly-out-fiddling/story-e6frg9df-1226395995258 Rio warns against fly-in, fly-out fiddling] ''[[The Australian]]'', published: 15 June 2012, accessed: 21 August 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Food waste.png|thumb|Food waste recycling]]

'''Food waste recycling''' is a process to convert [[food waste]] into useful materials and products for achieving sustainability of the environment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ts-1.eee.hku.hk/ccst9015sp12/greentech2/recycling-definition-and-overview/ Recycling: Definition and Overview]. ''Think Green''.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Food waste]] is defined as all inedible and edible parts of food that creates preceding and succeeding food processing, production and consumption.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greenpower.org.hk/html/eng/2013_6.shtml Hong Kong's “Zero Food Waste"]. ''Green Power'', Jun 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Green house gas|Greenhouse gases]], especially [[methane]] can be reduced by food waste recycling. Food waste recycling can also alleviate the saturation of [[landfill]] sites in [[Hong Kong]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www3.epa.gov/region9/waste/features/foodtoenergy/food-waste.html Turning Food Waste into Energy at the East Bay Municipal Utility District (EBMUD)]. ''US Environmental Protection Agency''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

===Current situation of food waste in Hong Kong===
The amount of food waste accounts for 38% of the [[municipal solid waste]] in [[Hong Kong]]. According to the statistics published by the [[Environmental Protection Department]], Hong Kong generates approximately 3,648 tonnes of food waste each day. About one-third of the food waste comes from the commercial and industrial sectors while the remaining part is from [[households]]. The situation of food waste disposal in [[Hong Kong]] has become more serious in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-hongkong-rubbish/hong-kong-drowning-in-waste-as-china-rubbish-ban-takes-toll-idUKKBN1FK0J9?il=0https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-hongkong-rubbish/hong-kong-drowning-in-waste-as-china-rubbish-ban-takes-toll-idUKKBN1FK0J9?il=0|title=Hong Kong drowning in waste as China rubbish ban takes toll|last=Editorial|first=Reuters|work=U.K.|access-date=2018-01-31|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; The amount of food waste from the commercial and industry sectors increased from 400 tonnes in 2002 to 1033 tonnes in 2014.&lt;ref name="epd"&gt;[http://www.epd.gov.hk/epd/english/environmentinhk/waste/prob_solutions/owt_food.html Food Waste Management in HK]. '' Environmental Protection Department''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Three steps of food waste recycling in Hong Kong===
Food waste recycling typically involves a three-step strategy that includes [[Separation process|separation]], [[Waste collection|collection]] and [[recycling]]. These three steps are interdependent and equally important in efficiently generating useful resources from food waste recycling.

====Separation====
The collected food waste is separated into two categories: pre-consumer food waste and post-consumer food waste. Pre-consumer food waste includes animal food waste, vegetable food waste, and waste from industrially-processed food. Post-consumer food waste refers to leftover food, such as from an unfinished restaurant order. Source separation also involves removing any food packaging and utensils.&lt;ref name="enb"&gt;[http://www.enb.gov.hk/en/files/FoodWastePolicyEng.pdf A Food Waste &amp; Yard Waste Plan For Hong Kong 2014-2022]. '' Environment Bureau '', February 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Collection====
Food waste vehicles, managed by the government, collect and deliver food waste to governmental recycling facilities. These recycling facilities, known as Organic Waste Treatment Facilities (OWTFs), will be spread across [[Districts of Hong Kong|Hong Kong's districts]]. The government plans to construct 5 to 6 OWTF networks, with a goal of recycling 1300 to 1500 tonnes of food waste between 2014 and 2024. The first facility is planned to be built in [[Siu Ho Wan]] to serve [[Lantau Island]] and districts nearby. The second and third are projected to be built in [[Sha Ling]] and [[Shek Kong]] so as to serve the [[New Territories]] and [[West Kowloon]].

The [[Environmental Protection Department]] also plans to construct two Organic Resources Recovery Centres (ORRCs) to collect the food waste and turn it into compost for recovery. These two centres will collectively be able to treat 500 tonnes of organic waste and divert 200 to 300 tonnes of waste from the landfills daily.&lt;ref name="ORRC"&gt;{{cite web |title=Organic Resources Recovery Centre (ORRC) |url=https://www.epd.gov.hk/epd/english/environmentinhk/waste/prob_solutions/WFdev_OWTF.html |website=Environmental Protection Department |accessdate=July 23, 2018 |date=30 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first Centre will also be located in [[Siu Ho Wan]]. The construction works commenced in December 2014 and it is expected to be commissioned in early 2018.&lt;ref name="ORRC" /&gt;

====Recycling====
Two technologies are used to turn food waste into biogas and useful products. The first technology is a low-carbon method that processes 100 to 300 of tonnes food waste per day.&lt;ref name="enb" /&gt; By applying this technology, it produces a source of the renewable energy [[biogas]]. It is estimated that the first Centre will be able to provide 14 million kWh of electricity to Hong Kong's power grid every year, which can power 3,000 households.&lt;ref name="ORRC" /&gt; The second technology converts food waste into [[succinic acid]] by using [[enzyme]]s and [[bacteria]].&lt;ref&gt;Lee, K., Lin, S., &amp; Chan, C. (2013) [https://www.cityu.edu.hk/see/news/TurningFoodWasteIntoTreasure.pdf Turning Food Waste into Treasure]. '' Housing Dynamics ''.&lt;/ref&gt; The residues can be processed to be [[animal feed]], [[fertilizer]]s and environmental-friendly cleansing products.&lt;ref&gt;[http://foodwaste.foe.org.hk/html/eng/c_convert.php What is the use of food waste?]. ''Friends of the Earth'', 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hong Kong Food Waste Recycling Program==

===The Hong Kong Government===

====Food Waste Recycling Partnership Scheme====
Food waste recycling partnership scheme is introduced by the [[Environmental Protection Department]] in 2009. The scheme was designed to promote a good practice on food waste management and enhance people’s experiences of separating and recycling food waste sources. The scheme collaborated with commercial and industrial sectors. Some members from the Hong Kong Government and that of the commercial and industrial sectors formed a working group for planning and managing the operation of the project. There are about 20 to 30 public and private organizations that participate in the scheme every year. In the project, all the participants will have a chance to practice separation process of food waste sources. The collection process of separated food waste will be carried out by the [[Environmental Protection Department]] and the [[Kowloon Bay Pilot Composting Plant]] will be responsible to the recycling part. The scheme also consists of discussion sessions for the participating parties to share their experience of recycling food waste. All participants will receive a commendation certificate at the end of the project.&lt;ref name="epd" /&gt;

====Food Waste Recycling Projects in Housing Estates====
From November 2012 to July 2014, The [[Hong Kong Housing Authority]] implemented a trial scheme, named as [[Food Waste Recycling Projects in Housing Estates]], with an aim to promote waste recycling in housing estates. The scheme involved 14 estates with about 3200 households. There were two modes adopted in the scheme. One is to convert food waste to fish grain by transporting them to a Central Food Waste Recycling Plant. The other one is to convert food waste into compost for farm by using [[micro-organisms]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/201412/17/P201412170528.htm LCQ16: Food waste recycling trial scheme in public housing estates]. ''Hong Kong Information Services Department'', 17 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Food Waste Recycling Scheme on Cheung Chau and Lamma Island====
On 31 March 2012, The Environmental Protection Department introduced a recycling scheme on [[Cheung Chau]] and [[Lamma Island]]. The purpose of the scheme is to promote and encourage food waste recycling on both islands. Food waste collected from shops and restaurants would be transported to the food waste treatment facilities on the islands. The food waste would be converted to organic compost.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/201305/08/P201305080291.htm LCQ9: Reduction and treatment of food waste]. ''Hong Kong Information Services Department'', 8 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-governmental organization===

====Hong Kong Organic Waste Recycling Centre====
[[Hong Kong Organic Waste Recycling Centre]] (HKOWRC) was established in 2011 as the first [[organic waste management]] consulting firm in Hong Kong. It combines local and foreign technologies to provide one-stop organic recycling services to customers. The assistance in collection of food waste solves problems of companies in immature recycling. Through commitment to different types of people, HKOWRC can promote and provide waste management training for particular customers.&lt;ref name="hkowrc"&gt;[http://www.hkowrc.com/eng-service.html Our Services]. ''Hong Kong Organic Waste Recycling Centre''.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Daily Food Waste Recycling Service=====
The objectives of the collection and recycling routine are to educate the general public in cherishing food as well as making good use of resources. The service encourages two-way cooperation for food waste recycling. HKOWRC aims to provide 24-hour recycling services particularly to [[Breeders|livestock breeders]], [[farmers]], [[Catering|catering industry]], [[schools]] and large-scale [[housing estates]]. For most of the cases, the recycled food waste is to be used by the service targets again for other purposes, therefore avoiding wastage of resources. For [[Breeders|livestock breeders]] and [[farmers]], the recycled food waste is converted to [[animal feeds]] and [[fertilizers]] that contain richer nutritional values than the conventional ones. It possibly gives higher yield. For [[Catering|catering industry]], the recycled food waste is converted to crops which are grown from organic compost from HKOWRC for latest organic food at a special prize. For [[schools]] and [[housing estates]], it aims to raise the awareness of food [[waste reduction]] when the recycling service reveals the huge amount of food wastes accumulated.&lt;ref name="hkowrc" /&gt;

{{Numismatics}}

This article is a collection of [[Numismatics|Numismatic]] and [[coin collecting]] terms with concise explanation for the beginner or professional.

'''Numismatics''' (ancient [[Greek language|Greek]]: '''{{lang|grc|νομισματική}}''') is the scientific study of [[money]] and its history in all its varied forms. While [[Numismatist (specialist)|numismatists]] are often characterized as studying [[coin]]s, the discipline also includes the study of [[banknotes]], stock certificates, [[medal]]s, medallions, and [[Token coin|tokens]] (also referred to as '''[[Exonumia]]''').

Sub-fields or related fields of numismatics are:

* '''[[Exonumia]]''': is the study of [[coin]]-like objects such as [[token coin]]s and [[medal]]s, and other items used in place of legal currency or for commemoration.
* '''[[Notaphily]]''': is the study of paper [[money]] or [[banknote]]s.
* '''[[Scripophily]]''': is the study and collection of [[stock]]s and [[Bond (finance)|bonds]].

: Coins minted by two or more state governments in conjunction. The Euro coins would be an example of this.
''' [[Alloy]]'''
: Homogeneous mixture of two or more elements, where the resulting compound has metallic properties. Common coin alloys include [[cupro-nickel]] (copper and nickel) and [[bronze]] (copper and tin).
''' Altered Date'''
: False date put on a coin to defraud collectors, usually to make it appear more valuable. Such alterations are often easily spotted with the aid of a magnifying glass.
''' Anepigraphic coin'''
: Coin without an inscription. Many ancient coins used only a simple picture of an animal to show value or weight.
''' [[Annealing (metallurgy)|Annealing]]'''

The impact of the two dies may also result in die cracks or defects.
''' Die Crack'''
: Fine raised line on a coin that was caused by a crack in the die.
''' Die Defect'''
: Imperfection of various sorts caused by a damaged die. May refer to a crack or clash or a chip out of the die, etc. A defect from a chipped die is called a cud.
''' Die Marriage'''
: The combination of a particular obverse and reverse set of dies. If one die is replaced a new die marriage is created.
''' Die State'''
: A variation in appearance to a coin struck by a single die, resulting from wear or alteration of the die. For example, the presence or absence of die cracks may signal a specific die state.
''' Die Variety'''
: Minor variation in a die, including repunched mintmarks, doubling, or deliberate minor changes to the die design.
''' [[Dime (United States coin)|Dime]]'''
: United States $0.10 coin. While the term is American in origin, Canadians often use the term as well.
''' Dipped, Dipping'''
: Chemical cleaning of a coin with a diluted acid. This "cleanliness" is a result of the surface of the coin being dissolved by the acid. Dipped coins almost always have a lower numismatic value than when they were in their former "dirty" state.

: Person who cuts the image of a design onto a die.
''' [[Mint-made errors|Error]]'''
: Usually a mis-made coin not intended for circulation, but can also refer to an engraving or die-cutting error not discovered until the coins are released to circulation. The mis-made coin errors are usually unique, but the engraving errors appear on all of the coins produced until the error is corrected. This may result in two or more [[Variety (numismatics)|varieties]] of the coin in the same year.
''' [[Essay (numismatics)|Essai, Essay]]'''

''' [[Coin grading|Grade]]'''
: The condition of a coin or amount of wear that a coin has received. Common grade terms used in North America, from worst to best, are Poor (Po), Fair (Fr), About Good (AG), Good (G), Very Good (VG), Fine (F), Very Fine (VF), Extra/Extremely Fine (EF or XF), Almost Uncirculated (AU), Uncirculated (UNC), and Brilliant Uncirculated (BU). Grading criteria may also include color, strength of strike, and "eye appeal".

==H==
''' [[Hammered coinage|Hammered]]'''
: A coin that has been struck by hand, using dies and a hammer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gold-sovereign.net/category/coin-numismatic-terminology/ |title=Coin / Numismatic Terminology |publisher=www.Gold-Sovereign.net |date=2013-08-13 |accessdate=2013-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;
''' High Relief'''
: A coin with the raised design high above the field. Coins struck in high relief often have problems with details not coming up sharp enough and dies having a shorter than usual lifespan. If the design is higher than the rim, the coin may not be stackable, and the highest points of the design will wear away very quickly.
''' [[Holey dollar]] &lt;small&gt;(Australia)&lt;/small&gt;'''
: Spanish 8 Real coin with a hole in centre, stamped with ''New South Wales 1813'' on obverse and ''five shilling'' on reverse.
''' Hub'''
: Positive-image punch that impresses the coin's design onto a die.

==I==
''' Incuse'''
: Part of the coin's design that has been impressed below the surface ([[Intaglio (sculpture)|intaglio]]). Not as popular as the "relief" method due to difficulty striking clearly and shorter lifespan of dies.
''' [[Ingot]]'''
: Bar of pure metal formed by pouring the molten metal into a mould. It may be stamped with its weight and purity.
''' [[Inscription]]'''
: Lettering and wording on a coin.

Not to be confused with 'Carat' used with precious stones (see [[Glossary of numismatics#C|above]]). Note that both originally referred to the seed of the carob tree ('Ceratonia siliqua' or 'Siliqua Graeca'). A Roman coin called the solidus weighed 24 'carats' or 'siliquae', 1/6 of a scruple; this became the standard of purity in western Europe.

==L==
''' [[Laureate]]'''

== GOOD Corps ==
[http://www.goodinc.com/ GOOD Corps] is GOOD Worldwide Inc’s social impact consultancy, specializing in developing initiatives and powerful calls to action. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Newman|first1=Andrew Adam|title=GOOD/Corps Aims to Help Business Meet Social Goals|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/13/business/media/13adco.html|work=New York Times|accessdate=22 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;”

== Founding and business model ==
GOOD was founded in 2006 by Ben Goldhirsh (son of ''[[Inc. magazine]]'' founder Bernie Goldhirsh) who wanted to create a "free press for the critical idealist."&lt;ref name="nytearnest"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/17/fashion/17good.html|title=A Magazine for Earnest Young Things|date=17 September 2006|work=The New York Times|accessdate=29 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eschewing experienced editors, he hired friends from college and high school, including [[Al Gore]]'s son, Al Gore III, to create a media company characterized by "both bold graphic style and an unconventional approach to business." The team was initially criticized by some industry experts, such as magazine executive and publishing expert Chip Block, who said, "This sounds a lot to me like vanity publishing, a bunch of kids sitting around with something they think is a  really good idea, and one of them has a lot of money."&lt;ref name="nytearnest"/&gt; Others in the industry praised the magazine's design and concept upon its launch.&lt;ref name="nytearnest" /&gt;

GOOD's business strategy included donating its magazine subscription fees entirely to charities, offering subscribers multiple options for which organization their fee supported.&lt;ref name="nytearnest"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wsj"&gt;{{cite web|last=Steel |first=Emily |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB115335722100411900 |title=Wealthy Son Aims to Build His Legacy |publisher=The Wall Street Journal |date=2006-07-20 |accessdate=2014-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goldhirsh explained the reasoning behind the strategy in an interview with [[Inc. (magazine)|''Inc.'']]: "The idea was that we would incentivize consumers with the added benefit that their money goes to charity, incentivize these charities to reach their constituencies for the $20 donation, and enjoy the added marketing and public relations that would come from having an innovative strategy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.inc.com/articles/2007/06/goldhirshQA.html |title=Inheriting the 'Entrepreneurial Spirit' - Ben Goldhirsh - GOOD magazine |publisher=Inc. |date=2007-06-19 |accessdate=2014-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goldhirsh's theory has been criticized{{weasel-inline|date=April 2016}} for not being a viable business model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rothkopf |first=David |url=https://foreignpolicy.com/story/cms.php?story_id=3942 |title=Doing Well By Doing Good |publisher=[[Foreignpolicy.com]] |date=2007-08-16 |accessdate=2014-04-16}}{{dead|date=April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former GOOD CEO [[Jonathan Greenblatt]] tested a concept called the "GOOD Sheet", a broadsheet product distributed exclusively at Starbucks. The company also experimented with a name-your-own-pricing scheme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fell |first=Jason |url=http://test.foliomag.com/2008/good-let-subscribers-name-their-own-price |title=GOOD to Let Subscribers Name Their Own Price - Audience Development @ FolioMag.com |publisher=Test.foliomag.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131215194401/http://test.foliomag.com/2008/good-let-subscribers-name-their-own-price |archivedate=2013-12-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/08/business/media/08good.html|title=Ice-Breaker at Starbucks: The GOOD Sheet|date=8 September 2008|work=The New York Times|accessdate=29 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Press coverage ==
Around launch time in the fall of 2006, GOOD was featured in the ''[[New York Times]]'' and mentioned by APM's Marketplace.&lt;ref&gt;[http://marketplace.publicradio.org/display/web/2006/11/20/smart_sociallyconscious_business/. Marketplace: Smart (socially-conscious) business&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927144043/http://marketplace.publicradio.org/display/web/2006/11/20/smart_sociallyconscious_business/ |date=2011-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The magazine and its website were covered by [[NPR]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=15143120 Magazine Aims to Be 'GOOD' for You] [[NPR]]. October 10, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=16548165 Magazine Makes 'GOOD']. NPR.

Instead of traditional marketing strategies, GOOD used their marketing budget to throw launch parties&lt;ref name="nytearnest"/&gt; which have been reviewed and discussed by publications such as [[The Washington Post]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/gog/bar-club-events/choose-good-anniversary-party,1142087.html#critic-review Choose ''GOOD'' Anniversary Party], ''[[The Washington Post]]''.  Julia Beizer. Sept. 5, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 17, 2011, a joint announcement was made that [[social network service]] [[Jumo]], a social engagement platform designed to connect users with causes and non-profits, founded by Facebook cofounder [[Chris Hughes]], would be merging with GOOD.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/18/business/for-profit-business-acquires-nonprofit-charity-site.html Two Groups That Help Nonprofits in a Merger], Stephanie Strom, ''[[The New York Times]]'', August 17, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.jumo.com/post/9037560404/jumo-and-good-combine-forces-to-create-content-and Jumo and GOOD Combine Forces to Create Content and Social Engagement Platform] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928000155/http://blog.jumo.com/post/9037560404/jumo-and-good-combine-forces-to-create-content-and |date=2011-09-28 }}, Chris Hughes, Jumo blog, August 17, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

GOOD's website, www.good.is, experienced 844 percent growth throughout 2015. In February 2016, they hired Nancy Miller, formerly of Wired, Fast Company, and Los Angeles magazine, to serve as editor-in-chief of the digital and print magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Richard Horgan |url=http://www.adweek.com/fishbowlny/good-magazine-nancy-miller/370338 |title=GOOD Magazine Has a New Editor in Chief |publisher=Adweek.com |date=2016-03-18 |accessdate=2016-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Culture of Guatemala}}
'''Guatemalan literature''' is literature written by Guatemalan authors, whether in the indigenous languages present in the country or in Spanish. Though there was likely literature in Guatemala before the arrival of the Spanish, all the texts that exist today were written after their arrival.

==Literature in Mayan languages==
The [[Popol Vuh]] is the most significant work of Guatemalan literature in the Quiché language, and one of the most important of Pre-Columbian American literature. It is a compendium of Mayan stories and legends, aimed to preserve Mayan traditions. The first known version of this text dates from the 16th century and is written in Quiché transcribed in Latin characters. It was translated into Spanish by the Dominican priest [[Francisco Ximénez]] in the beginning of the 18th century. Due to its combination of historical, mythical, and religious elements, it has been called the Mayan Bible. It is a vital document for understanding the culture of pre-Columbian America.

The [[Rabinal Achí]] is a dramatic work consisting of dance and text that is preserved as it was originally represented. It is thought to date from the 15th century and narrates the mythical and dynastic origins of the Kek'chi' people, and their relationships with neighboring peoples. The story tells how the prince of the Kek'chi' fights against neighboring tribes and, while he initially defeats them, he later is captured and taken before the king Job'Toj, who gives him back to his people to say goodbye to and dance with his princess for the last time. The Rabinal Achí is performed during the Rabinal festival of January 25, the day of Saint Paul. It was declared a masterpiece of oral tradition of humanity by UNESCO in 2005. and that miguel angel was a writer for guatemala

==Colonial period: 16th - 19th centuries==
The 16th century saw the first native-born Guatemalan writers that wrote in Spanish. Major writers of this era include [[Sor Juana de Maldonado]], considered the first poet playwright of colonial Central America, and the historian [[Francisco Antonio de Fuentes y Guzmán]]. The Jesuit [[Rafael Landívar]] (1731–1793) is considered as the first great Guatemalan poet. He was forced into exile by [[Charles III of Spain|Carlos III]]. He traveled to Mexico and later to Italy, where he died. He originally wrote his [[Rusticatio Mexicana]] and his poems praising the bishop [[Figueredo y Victoria]] in Latin.

At this time, traditional poetic forms were developed to be sung. These include the [[villancico]] for use on the eves of main religious holidays. These were the only liturgical occasions on which songs in vernacular languages were permitted. (All other events were exclusively in Latin.) In Guatemala, as throughout the Spanish empire, other musical compositions with Spanish lyrics included consisted [[sainete]]s, [[jácara]]s, [[tonada]]s, and [[cantata]]s. Authors of these poems, who also put their works to music, include [[Manuel José de Quirós]] (ca. 1765-1790), [[Pedro Nolasco Estrada Aristondo]], [[Pedro Antonio Rojas]], and [[Rafael Antonio Castellanos]] (ca. 1725-1791). Castellanos is one of the most important in the Hispanic world and in the music of Guatemala.

During the 18th century, Guatemalan literature was influenced by French neoclassicism, as is seen in educational and philosophical works by authors such as [[Rafael García Goyena]] and [[Matías de Córdoba]].

==Guatemalan literature after independence: the nineteenth century==

[[File:José Milla y Vidaurre.jpg|thumb|Salomé Gil]]

Guatemala gained independence from Spain in 1821, in its desire to establish political and commercial relations with other countries. The literature during this period is marked by political strife, which dominated the essay and treatise genres. This era also saw the birth of journalism in Guatemala, with figures like [[Antonio José de Irisarri]]

During the 19th century Guatemalan literature began to develop independently from Spanish literature, though it continued to incorporate European influences. Important writers of this era include [[María Josefa García Granados]] and [[José Batres Montúfar]] (known simply as "Pepe Batres"), who co-wrote the "Sermón para José María Castilla", a work that was scandalous at the time. Batres is also the author of the poem "Yo pienso en ti", one of the best known of Guatemalan literature.

In the second half of the 19th century, the novel dominated Guatemalan literature, thanks especially to [[José Milla y Vidaurre]], considered the father of the Guatemalan novel. He signed some of his works with the pseudonym "Salomé Jil", an anagram of his name. Major works by Milla y Vidaurre include ''La hija del Adelantado'' (1866), ''Los Nazarenos'' (1867), ''El visitador'' (1867), and ''El libro sin nombre''.

Guatemalan writers also participated in Latin American modernism, heir to French symbolism and Parnassianism and driven by the Nicaraguan [[Rubén Darío]]. In poetry, important writers included [[Domingo Estrada]], [[Máximo Soto Hall]], and [[María Cruz (poet)|María Cruz]]. The versatile writer [[Enrique Gómez Carrillo]] represented modernism in prose.

==Twentieth century==
In the 20th century, Guatemalan literature reached a level comparable to that of other Latin American countries. The most important Guatemalan writers in this period are novelist [[Miguel Ángel Asturias]] (1967 Nobel Prize winner and author of novels including ''[[El Señor Presidente]]'' and ''[[Hombres de Maíz]]''), poet [[Luis Cardoza y Aragón]], short story writer and novelist [[Augusto Monterroso]] (2000 Príncipe de Asturias prize winner), and playwright [[Carlos Solórzano]]. In general, 20th-century Guatemalan literature is strongly influenced by politics, as evidenced by the fact that its authors were forced into exile during Guatemala's successive dictatorships and civil wars.

20th-century Guatemalan literature is usually divided by generation or decade:
* The generation of 1910 or "the Comet"
* The generation of 1920
* The generation of 1930 or "Grupo Tepeus"
* The generation of 1940 or "Grupo Acento"
* The Grupo Saker-ti (1944–1954)
* The generation "comprometida" (after 1954)

The following is an alphabetical list of works of art that are often called by a non-English name in an English context. (Of course, many such titles are simply the names of people: ''[[Don Quixote]]'', ''[[Irma la Douce]]'', ''[[Madame Bovary]]'', ''[[Tosca]]'', ''[[Pelléas et Mélisande]]''. These have been omitted, as have examples where the English may easily be inferred: ''[[Symphonie fantastique]]'', ''[[Les liaisons dangereuses]]''.)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3186">A '''list of musical instruments referenced in fiction''' which do not exist in reality:

==Baliset==
In the [[Dune (franchise)|''Dune'' universe]], the ''baliset'' is a very long nine-stringed zither. In the 1984 film ''[[Dune (film)|Dune]]'', the baliset role{{clarify|date=July 2012}} is filled by a cosmetically{{clarify|date=July 2012}} altered [[Chapman stick]].&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=TpIJAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=baliset+chapman&amp;dq=baliset+chapman&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=sie9T5aiL4idiQK5vrSaDg&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAA&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gaffophone==

The ''Gaffophone'' is an instrument invented by [[Gaston Lagaffe]] in [[André Franquin]]'s eponymous comics series. It looks like a giant [[harp]] with a large horn attached to it and is known for making atrocious noise that makes people and animals run away and buildings collapse. Franquin used it in numerous gags.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lefigaro.fr/lefigaromagazine/2006/10/27/01006-20061027ARTMAG90411-un_fabuleux_inventeur.php&lt;/ref&gt;

==Harolina==
In the [[Redwall]] series of fantasy books, the ''harolina'' is a type of stringed instrument played by the anthropomorphic hares of the series.&lt;ref&gt;''The Bellmaker''. By Brian Jacques, Allan Curless.  Philomel Books, 1995. {{ISBN|0-399-22805-5}}, 978-0-399-22805-6. Pg 266.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Holophonor==
In the animated series ''[[Futurama]]'', the ''holophonor'', played by [[Fry (futurama)|Fry]], is based on the Visi-Sonor{{citation needed|date=February 2010}} and appears in episodes "[[Parasites Lost]]" and "[[The Devil's Hands are Idle Playthings]]"

==Ressikan flute==
In the [[Star Trek]] universe, the ''ressikan flute'' is a musical instrument played by [[Captain Picard]].  The instrument is an artifact discovered on a probe sent out by the former residents of [[Kataan]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Star trek encyclopedia: a reference guide to the future''. By Michael Okuda, Doug Drexler, Debbie Mirek.  Edition: 3, illustrated.  Pocket Books, 1999.  {{ISBN|0-671-53609-5}}, 978-0-671-53609-1.  Pg 408.&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Vulcan Harp''==
The Vulcan Harp appears in the [[Star Trek]] universe, played by Mr. Spock.  However, this is an actual instrument, though quite rare.  Hence, it is not completely fictional anymore.

==''Visi-Sonor''==
The Visi-Sonor appears in the [[Isaac Asimov]] book [[Foundation and Empire]]. The fictional musical instrument stimulates brain cells and causes imagined lights, sounds and emotions directly:
&lt;blockquote style="font-style:italic;"&gt;"His long fingers caressed softly and slowly, pressing lightly on contacts with a rippling motion, resting themselves momentarily on one key then another – and in the air before them there was a soft glowing rosiness, just inside the range of vision."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

With the Mule's great power, the Visi-Sonor became a killing device later in the book.&lt;ref&gt;''Isaac Asimov: The Foundations Of Science Fiction''. James Gunn. Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 1996 {{ISBN|0-8108-5420-1}}, 978-0-8108-5420-8. Pg 27.[https://books.google.com/books?id=XQE2f6CWyvEC&amp;pg=PA27&amp;dq=Visi-Sonor&amp;ei=1mQqStXgH4nGyATW7L2kBw]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3335">The '''Local Technical Assistance Program''' (LTAP) is a [[Federal Highway Administration]] [[technology transfer]] program that provides technical assistance and training to local highway departments in the USA. It transfers knowledge of innovative transportation technology to both urban and rural local communities in the United States and to American Indian tribal governments.

The program is a partnership effort with funding provided from Federal, State, and local agency resources as well as universities and the private sector. Each center is funded by a 50:50 match of state and federal funds, although some states choose to provide more than the minimum required amount. 

There are 58 Technology Transfer (T2) Centers established—one in each State, one serving Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, and seven serving American Indian tribal governments—to provide training and technical assistance to local governments. Most centers are run by universities, and a few are hosted by their state's department of transportation. Several, like the Cornell Local Roads Program and Texas LTAP, are part of university-based [[cooperative extension service]]s. It was founded in 1982, although several centers predate the national program.

LTAP Centers assist nearly 38,000 local government agencies and over 540 federally recognized tribes in maintaining and improving transportation infrastructure and services with the latest technology and information available. Local transportation agencies expend over $30 billion annually to maintain 2.9 million miles of roads [1.3 paved/1.6 unpaved] with over 290,000 bridges.

Many local road departments are managed by individuals who generally have practical experience but little formal technical education or training. LTAP has a variety of tools - training events, technology transfer resources, and personalized assistance - to assist local agencies in improving their transportation operations. Many state transportation departments also benefit from LTAP services. In 2011, LTAP centers trained over 151,000 people in over 5300 sessions.

Common topics for training and assistance include [[pavement management]] and [[road#Maintenance|maintenance]], [[road works]] safety, [[traffic sign]]s and [[road surface marking|pavement markings]], [[public works]] department management, [[snow removal|snow and ice control]], and [[drainage]].  

Two important factors in LTAP's success are flexibility and networking. Although certain tasks are mandated, like providing a newsletter and a lending library for local highway officials, each LTAP center has considerable leeway in adapting its programs to address the unique challenges faced by the customers it serves.

Centers also work together on many projects. If one center has a pavement specialist on their staff, they may provide training for another state's center, in exchange for work zone training. Also, should a local highway official ask a question that their center can't answer, it can be forwarded to the 57 other centers, as well as related FHWA and State DOT offices. Usually, an answer is supplied within short order.

A '''mechanical floor''', '''mechanical penthouse''', '''mechanical layer''' or '''mechanical level''' is a [[storey|story]] of a [[high-rise]] building that is dedicated to [[mechanics|mechanical]] and [[electronics]] equipment. "Mechanical" is the most commonly used term, but words such as ''utility'', ''technical'', ''service'', and ''plant'' are also used. They are present in all tall buildings including the [[World's tallest structures#Tallest buildings|world's tallest]] [[skyscrapers]] with significant [[structural engineering|structural]], [[mechanical engineering|mechanical]] and [[aesthetics]] concerns.

While most buildings have [[mechanical room]]s, typically in the [[basement]], tall buildings require dedicated floors throughout the structure for this purpose, for a variety of reasons discussed below. Because they use up valuable floor area (just like elevator shafts), engineers try to minimize the number of mechanical floors while allowing for sufficient [[redundancy (engineering)|redundancy]] in the services they provide. As a [[rule of thumb]], skyscrapers require a mechanical floor for every 10 tenant floors (10%) although this percentage can vary widely (see [[#Examples|examples]] below). In some buildings they are clustered in groups that divide the building into blocks, in others they are spread evenly through the structure, while in others still they are mostly concentrated at the top.

Mechanical floors are generally counted in the building's [[floor numbering]] (this is required by some [[building code]]s) but are accessed only by service elevators. In some legislations they have been excluded from maximum floor area calculations, leading to significant increases in building sizes; this is the case in [[New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://in-arch.net/NYC/nycadd.html in-arch.net]&lt;/ref&gt;  Sometimes buildings are designed with a mechanical floor located on the [[thirteenth floor]], to avoid problems in renting the space due to [[Triskaidekaphobia|superstitions about that number]].

==Structural concerns==

[[Image:Shanghai Shimao Plaza Construction.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A 60-story building under construction in [[Shanghai]]. The truss sections (made of triangular struts) will house mechanical floors.]]

Some skyscrapers have narrow building cores that require stabilization to prevent collapse. Typically this is accomplished by joining the core to the external supercolumns at regular intervals using [[outrigger]] [[trusses]]. The triangular shape of the [[strut]]s precludes the laying of tenant floors, so these sections house mechanical floors instead, typically in groups of two. Additional stabilizer elements such as [[tuned mass damper]]s also require mechanical floors to contain or service them.

This layout is usually reflected in the internal [[elevator]] zoning. Since nearly all elevators require machine rooms above the last floor they service, mechanical floors are often used to divide shafts that are stacked on top of each other to save space. A transfer level or [[skylobby]] is sometimes placed just below those floors.

Elevators that reach the top tenant floor also require overhead machine rooms; those are sometimes put into full-size mechanical floors but most often into a mechanical [[penthouse apartment|penthouse]], which can also contain communications gear and window-washing equipment. On most building designs this is a simple "box" on the [[roof]], on others it is concealed inside a decorative [[spire]]. A consequence of this is that if the topmost mechanical floors are counted in the total, there can be no such thing as a true "top-floor office" in a skyscraper with this design.

==Mechanical concerns==

Besides structural support and elevator management, the primary purpose of mechanical floors is [[HVAC|heating, ventilation and air-conditioning]], and other services. They contain [[electrical generator]]s, [[chiller]] plants, [[water pump]]s, and so on.

In particular, the problem of bringing and keeping water on the upper floors is an important constraint in the design of skyscrapers. Water is necessary for tenant use, [[air conditioning]], equipment [[Heat transfer|cooling]], and basic [[firefighting]] through [[fire sprinkler|sprinkler]]s (especially important since ground-based firefighting equipment usually cannot reach higher than a dozen floors or so). It is inefficient, and seldom feasible, for [[water pump]]s to send water directly to a height of several hundred meters, so intermediate pumps and water tanks are used. The pumps on each group of mechanical floors act as a relay to the next one up, while the tanks hold water in reserve for normal and emergency use. Usually the pumps have enough power to bypass a level if the pumps there have failed, and send water two levels up.

Special care is taken towards fire safety on mechanical floors that contain generators, compressors and elevator machine rooms, since [[oil]] is used as either a [[fuel]] or [[lubricant]] in those elements.

Mechanical floors also contain communication and control systems that service the building and sometimes outbound communications, such as through a large rooftop [[antenna (electronics)|antenna]] (which is also physically held in place inside the top-floor mechanical levels).

Modern computerized [[HVAC control system]]s minimize the problem of equipment distribution among floors, by enabling central remote control.

==Aesthetics concerns==

[[Image:Lightmatter wtc.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The former [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]] twin towers. The "dark bands" were vents for the mechanical floors.]]
[[File:Mechanical Penthouse of High Rise Condominium.jpg|270px|thumb|The mechanical penthouse (top, box shaped section with vent) housing elevator equipment, boilers, and cooling tower for high rise condominium in [[Toronto]], ON. concealed within single room with exterior designed to match building]]

Most mechanical floors require external vents or [[louver]]s for [[Ventilation (architecture)|ventilation]] and heat rejection along most or all of their perimeter, precluding the use of glass [[window]]s. The resulting visible "dark bands" can disrupt the overall [[facade]] design especially if it is fully glass-clad. Different [[architectural style]]s approach this challenge in different ways.

In the [[Modern architecture|Modern]] and [[International style (architecture)|International]] styles of the 1960s and 1970s where [[form follows function]], the vents' presence is not seen as undesirable. Rather it emphasizes the functional layout of the building by dividing it neatly into equal blocks, mirroring the layout of the elevators and offices inside. This could be clearly seen on the Twin Towers of the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]] and can be seen on the [[Willis Tower]]. In the [[IDS Tower]] in [[Minneapolis]], the lowest mechanical floor serves as a visual separation from the street- and [[skyway]]-level Crystal Court shopping center and the office tower above; the upper mechanical floor (above the 50th and 51st floors, the uppermost occupied floors) serves as a "crown" to the building.

Conversely, designers of the recent [[Postmodern architecture|postmodern]]-style skyscrapers strive to mask the vents and other mechanical elements in clever and ingenious ways. This is accomplished through such means as complex wall angles ([[Petronas Towers]]), intricate [[latticework]] [[Cladding (construction)|cladding]] ([[Jin Mao Building]]), or non-glassed sections that appear to be [[Ornament (architecture)|ornamental]] ([[Taipei 101]], roof of Jin Mao Building).

==Examples==

These are examples of above-ground mechanical floor layouts for some of the world's tallest buildings. In each case, mechanical penthouses and spires are counted as floors, leading to higher total floor counts than usual.

* '''[[Taipei 101]]''': Floors 7&amp;ndash;8, 17&amp;ndash;18, 25&amp;ndash;26, 34, 42, 50, 58, 66, 74, 82, 87, 90, 92 to 100 in the penthouse (total 17/102, or 17%). The [https://web.archive.org/web/20050308170551/http://www.tfc101.com.tw/english/taipei/introduce/design02-1.htm official count] of 11 corresponds to the number of groups in the office section. Floors 92&amp;ndash;100 contain [https://web.archive.org/web/20050213044052/http://www.taipei101tower.com/eflash.html "communications equipment"] and so are not typically counted as mechanical since they do not service the building itself.
* '''[[One World Trade Center]]''': Floors 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 91, 92, 93, 103, 104.
:'''[[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|Previous WTC]]''' (Twin Towers): Floors 7&amp;ndash;8, 41&amp;ndash;42, 75&amp;ndash;76, and 108&amp;ndash;109 (total 8/110, 7%). The 110th Floor of 1 WTC (North Tower) housed television and radio transmission equipment. Some sources erroneously mention 12 floors, in groups of 3, due to the height of the vents (actually the ceilings there were higher) and because levels 44 and 78 were [[skylobby|skylobbies]] which in many buildings sit directly on top of the mechanical floors. However the twin towers had one [[One World Trade Center tenants|occupied]] office floor under each skylobby, accessible through [[escalator]]s.

* '''[[Willis Tower]]''' (Formerly [[Sears Tower]]): Levels 29&amp;ndash;32, 64&amp;ndash;65, 88&amp;ndash;89, 104&amp;ndash;108, 109 (penthouse), and 110 (penthouse roof) - total 15/110, 13%.
* '''[[Petronas Towers]]''': Floors 6&amp;ndash;7, 38&amp;ndash;40, 43, 84, 87&amp;ndash;88 (total 9/88, 10%) ([https://web.archive.org/web/20050213010155/http://pgoh.free.fr/petronas_nyt.html ''New York Times''], ''Elevator World'' magazine)
* '''[[Jin Mao Building]]''': Floors 51&amp;ndash;52, and 89&amp;ndash;93 in the penthouse (total 7/93, 7.5%) ([http://www.skyscraperpage.com/cities/?buildingID=9 SkyscraperPage])
* '''[[Burj Khalifa]]''': Floors 17&amp;ndash;18, 40&amp;ndash;42, 73&amp;ndash;75, 109&amp;ndash;111, 136&amp;ndash;138, 155, and 160&amp;ndash;168, in the penthouse, (total 25/168, 15%)
* '''[[John Hancock Center]]''': Floors 16&amp;ndash;17, 42&amp;ndash;43, 93, 99&amp;ndash;100 (penthouse) - total 7/100, 7%
* '''[[Empire State Building]]''': Floors 87&amp;ndash;101 - total 15/102, 14%
* '''[[International Commerce Center]]''': Floors 6&amp;ndash;7, 17&amp;ndash;18, 24&amp;ndash;25, 34, 43, 52, 61, 70, 79, 88, 97, 104, and 114 (total 17/118, 14%)
* '''[[Shanghai World Financial Center]]''': Floors 6, 18, 30, 42, 54, 66, 78, 89, and 90 (total 9/100, 9%)
* '''[[Lotte World Tower]]''': Floors 3&amp;ndash;4, 13, 21&amp;ndash;23, 39&amp;ndash;41, 59, 60, 72&amp;ndash;75, 83, 84, 102&amp;ndash;106, 115, and 116 (total 24/123, 20%)

'''''Mulaney''''' is an American [[sitcom]] that aired on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] from October 5, 2014 to February 15, 2015. Stand-up comedian and former ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' writer [[John Mulaney]] created the show and starred as a fictionalized version of himself. At the beginning of each episode, and sometimes throughout, Mulaney would perform [[stand-up comedy]] to the studio audience. The show suffered from low ratings and poor critical reviews, and was cancelled in March 2015.&lt;ref name=DeadlineCanceled&gt;{{cite web|last1=Andreeva|first1=Nellie|title=Dana Walden Talks ‘New Girl’ &amp; ‘The Mindy Project’ Future, Fox’s Scheduling Needs|url=http://deadline.com/2015/01/new-girl-mindy-project-future-scheduling-fox-dana-walden-1201352538/|website=Deadline|accessdate=April 11, 2015|date=January 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The series premiered October 5, 2014.

On October 18, 2014, the day before the third episode was supposed to air, Fox announced it was cutting three episodes from its order. This resulted in the production of ''Mulaney'' being shut down, as the thirteenth episode had already been filmed and production of the fourteenth was about to begin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2014/10/mulaney-order-cut-13-episodes-fox-854490/|title=‘Mulaney’ Order Trimmed To 13 Episodes|author=Nellie Andreeva|work=Deadline}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Less than a month later, Fox moved ''Mulaney'' into the 7:30 PM timeslot where ''[[Bob's Burgers]]'' had been airing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rockwell |first=Sledge |url=http://uproxx.com/tv/fox-decides-to-switch-mulaney-and-bobs-burgers-on-sunday-nights/ |title=Fox Decides To Switch ‘Mulaney’ And ‘Bob’s Burgers’ On Sunday Nights |publisher=Uproxx.com |date=2014-11-11 |accessdate=2016-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The season ended on February 15, 2015 and Fox announced ''Mulaney''{{'}}s cancellation shortly thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvseriesfinale.com/tv-show/mulaney-cancelled-by-fox-no-season-two-35846/ |title=Mulaney: Cancelled by FOX, no season 2 |publisher=Tvseriesfinale.com |date=2015-02-28 |accessdate=2016-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
{{quote box|quote=I look back on making the show really fondly. It's my noble failure. I tried, and I wanted to do it this way. Some people liked it—just not enough.|align=right|width=300px|source=John Mulaney, ''New Times''&lt;ref&gt;Pfeffer, Ryan (May 1, 2015). [http://www.browardpalmbeach.com/arts/with-no-more-distractions-john-mulaney-returns-to-stand-up-6945958 "WITH NO MORE DISTRACTIONS, JOHN MULANEY RETURNS TO STAND UP"]. ''New Times''. Retrieved June 20, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Even before ''Mulaney'' aired, critics were wary of the direction of the show.  After viewing the show's trailer, Eric Dodds with ''TIME'' magazine penned an article called, "8 Ways the Trailer for ''Mulaney'' Resembles ''Seinfeld''," and said it could "trigger a little déjà vu."&lt;ref name=dodds/&gt;  In regard to its [[multi-camera]] format, Canadian magazine ''Maclean's'' asked, "why would a cool comic pick such an uncool format?"&lt;ref name=seinfeld&gt;Weinman, Jaime J. (August 4, 2014), "'The New Seinfeld'".  ''Maclean's''. '''127''' (30/31):60-62&lt;/ref&gt;

Ultimately, the show was universally panned by critics, with most reviews drawing unflattering comparisons to ''Seinfeld''. On [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the show has an approval rating of 17% based on 42 reviews, with an average rating of 4.3/10. The site's critical consensus states, "John Mulaney, we know [[Jerry Seinfeld]]. ''Seinfeld'' was funny. ''Mulaney'', you're no ''Seinfeld''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/mulaney/s01|title=Mulaney: Season 1|date=October 5, 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]], the series has a weighted average score of 38 out of 100, based on 27 critics, indicating "generally unfavorable reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/tv/mulaney|title=Mulaney|work=Metacritic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[James Poniewozik]] with ''TIME'' magazine said the show "seems like something a dutiful student might have produced for his final project in his 'Tropes and Themes in the 1990s Sitcom' class."&lt;ref&gt;Poniewozik, James (October 3, 2014), "Review: Mulaney Does Its Homework Too Well." ''TIME''.&lt;/ref&gt;  Robert Bianco with ''[[USA Today]]'' called the sitcom a "misfire."&lt;ref&gt;Bianco, Robert (October 3, 2014), "Fox's ‘Mulaney' is a misfire of a sitcom". ''USA Today''.&lt;/ref&gt; The show was named the fourth-worst show of 2014 by ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/gallery/0,,20326356_20879083,00.html#30260950|title=5 Worst TV Shows of 2014|work=EW.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Mulaney'' fared poorly commercially as well, with the series premiere only getting 2.3 million viewers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2014/10/07/sunday-final-ratings-once-upon-a-time-resurrection-madam-secretary-adjusted-down/311599/|title=Sunday Final Ratings: ‘Once Upon a Time’, ‘Resurrection’ &amp; ‘Revenge’ Adjusted Up; ‘Madam Secretary’ Adjusted Down|work=TVbytheNumbers|accessdate=February 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; the  weakest scores for any of the fall's series premieres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2014/data/ratings/foxs-mulaney-off-to-weak-start-sunday-once-strong-madam-secretary-rises-1201322395/|title=‘Mulaney’ Ratings Weak in Premiere; ‘Once Upon a Time’ Ratings Strong|work=Variety|accessdate=February 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The episode from December 21, 2014, became the lowest rated episode, with fewer than 1 million views; the January 18, 2015 episode, airing after the [[2014–15 NFL playoffs#NFC Championship Game: Seattle Seahawks 28, Green Bay Packers 22 (OT)|NFC Championship Game]], became the highest-rated, with over 3 million viewers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvseriesfinale.com/tv-show/mulaney-season-one-ratings-34246/|title=Mulaney TV show on FOX: latest ratings (cancel or renew?)|publisher=TV Series Finale}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Electric music technology''' refers to [[musical instrument]]s and [[Sound recording|recording device]]s that use electrical circuits, which are often combined with mechanical technologies. Examples of electric musical instruments include the electro-mechanical [[electric piano]] (invented in 1929), the [[electric guitar]] (invented in 1931), the electro-mechanical [[Hammond organ]] (developed in 1934) and the [[electric bass]] (invented in 1935). All of these electric instruments do not produce a sound that is audible by the performer or audience in a performance setting unless they are connected to [[instrument amplifier]]s and [[loudspeaker cabinet]]s, which made them sound loud enough for performers and the audience to hear. Amplifiers and loudspeakers are separate from the instrument in the case of the electric guitar (which uses a [[guitar amplifier]]), electric bass (which uses a [[bass amplifier]]) and some electric organs (which use a [[Leslie speaker]] or similar cabinet) and most electric pianos. Some electric organs and electric pianos include the amplifier and speaker cabinet within the main housing for the instrument.

Electric sound recording and reproduction are electrical or mechanical techniques and devices for the inscription and re-creation of [[sound]] waves, such as spoken voice, singing, [[instrumental music]], or sound effects. Acoustic analog recording is achieved by a small [[microphone]] diaphragm that can record sound waves on a [[phonograph]] (in which a stylus senses grooves on a record) or [[magnetic tape]]. The first practical sound recording and reproduction device was the mechanical [[phonograph cylinder]], invented by [[Thomas Edison]] in 1877 and patented in 1878.&lt;ref&gt;[http://patimg1.uspto.gov/.piw?Docid=00200521&amp;idkey=NONE Publication Images&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; 
The next major technical development was the invention of the [[Berliner Gramophone|gramophone disc]] in 1889. For much of the 20th century, records were the most common way of selling sound recordings. The widespread availability of records and the development of [[radio broadcasting]] enabled a much larger proportion of people to listen to songs and pieces performed by the top artists, enabling the development of national and even international musical stars. In the 1970s, the [[compact cassette]] became a major consumer audio format. Advances in electronic and mechanical miniaturization led to the development of the [[Sony]] [[Walkman]], a pocket-sized cassette player introduced in 1979, which allowed consumers to listen to their favourite albums outside of their home.

An [[electric piano]] is an electric [[musical instrument]] which produces sounds when a performer presses the keys of the [[piano]]-style [[musical keyboard]]. Pressing keys causes mechanical hammers to strike metal strings or tines, leading to vibrations which are converted into electrical signals by [[Pick up (music technology)|magnetic pickups]], which are then connected to an [[instrument amplifier]] and [[loudspeaker]] to make a sound loud enough for the performer and audience to hear. Unlike a [[synthesizer]], the electric piano is not an [[Electronic musical instrument|electronic instrument]]. Instead, it is an electro-mechanical instrument. Some early electric pianos used lengths of wire to produce the tone, like a traditional piano. Smaller electric pianos used short slivers of steel, metal tines or short wires to produce the tone. The earliest electric pianos were invented in the late 1920s; the 1929 ''Neo-[[C. Bechstein Pianofortefabrik|Bechstein]]'' [[electric grand piano]] was among the first. Probably the earliest stringless model was [[Lloyd Loar]]'s [[Vivi-Tone]] Clavier. A few other noteworthy producers of electric pianos include Baldwin Piano and Organ Company and the [[Wurlitzer]] company.

Early electric piano recordings include [[Duke Ellington]]'s in 1955 and [[Sun Ra]]'s ''India'' as well as other tracks from the 1956 sessions included on his second album ''Super Sonic Jazz'' (aka ''Super Sonic Sounds''). The popularity of the electric piano began to grow in the late 1950s after [[Ray Charles]]'s 1959 hit record "[[What'd I Say]]", reaching its height during the 1970s, after which they were progressively displaced by more lightweight electronic pianos capable of piano-like sounds without the disadvantages of electric pianos' heavy weight and [[moving parts|moving mechanical parts]]. Another factor driving their development and acceptance was the progressive electrification of popular music and the need for a portable keyboard instrument capable of high-volume amplification. Musicians adopted a number of types of domestic electric pianos for rock and pop use. This encouraged their manufacturers to modify them for stage use and then develop models primarily intended for stage use.

Digital electronic [[stage piano]]s have largely replaced most of the original electro-mechanical instruments in the 2000s, due to the small size, low weight and versatility of digital instruments, which can produce a huge range of tones besides piano tones (e.g., emulations of [[Hammond organ]] sounds, synthesizer sounds, etc.). However, some performers still perform and record with vintage electric pianos. In 2009, [[Fender Rhodes]] produced a new line of electro-mechanical pianos, known as the Rhodes Mark 7 followed by an offering from [[Vintage Vibe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.keyboardmag.com/article/vintage-vibe-electric-pianos/150018|title=Vintage Vibe Electric Pianos|author=Jon Regen|date=21 November 2012|publisher=[[Keyboard Magazine]]|accessdate=27 June 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131103122218/http://www.keyboardmag.com/article/vintage-vibe-electric-pianos/150018|archivedate=3 November 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Electric guitar===
[[File:Kramer_XKG-20_sm.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A [[Kramer Guitars|Kramer]] XKG-20 electric guitar circa 1980.]]
An [[electric guitar]] is a [[guitar]] that uses a [[Pickup (music technology)|pickup]] to convert the vibration of its strings into electrical impulses. The most common guitar pickup uses the principle of direct [[electromagnetic induction]]. The signal generated by an electric guitar is too weak to drive a [[loudspeaker]], so it is [[Guitar amplifier|amplified]] before being sent to a loudspeaker. The output of an electric guitar is an electric signal, and the signal can easily be altered by electronic circuits to add "color" to the sound. Often the signal is modified using [[Effects unit|electronic effect]]s such as [[reverb]] and [[Distortion (music)|distortion]].

Invented in 1931, the electric guitar became a necessity as [[jazz]] guitarists sought to amplify their sound in the [[big band]] format. Early proponents of the electric guitar on record included [[Les Paul]], [[Lonnie Johnson (musician)|Lonnie Johnson]], [[Sister Rosetta Tharpe]], [[T-Bone Walker]], and [[Charlie Christian]]. During the 1950s and 1960s, the electric guitar became the most important instrument in [[pop music]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Encyclopedia of 20th-Century Technology, Volume 2 |first1=Colin |last1=Hempstead |first2=William E. |last2=Worthington |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |year=2005 |isbn=1-57958-464-0|page=793 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0wkIlnNjDWcC&amp;pg=PA793}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has evolved into an instrument that is capable of a multitude of sounds and styles. It served as a major component in the development of [[electric blues]], [[rock and roll]], [[rock music]], and many other genres of music.

Electric guitar design and construction vary greatly in the shape of the body and the configuration of the neck, bridge, and pickups. Guitars have a fixed [[bridge (guitar)|bridge]] or a spring-loaded hinged bridge that lets players bend notes or chords up or down in pitch or perform a [[vibrato]]. The sound of a guitar can be modified by [[extended technique|new playing techniques]] such as [[string bending]], [[tapping]], [[Hammer-on|hammering on]], using [[audio feedback]], or [[slide (guitar technique)|slide]] guitar playing. There are several types of electric guitar, including the solid-body guitar, various types of hollow-body guitars, the seven-string guitar, which typically adds a low B string below the low E, and the twelve-string electric guitar, which has six pairs of strings.

[[Popular music]] and rock groups often use the electric guitar in two roles: as a [[rhythm guitar]], which provides the [[Chord (music)|chord]] sequence or [[Chord progression|progression]] and sets the [[Beat (music)|beat]] (as part of a [[rhythm section]]), and as a [[lead guitar]], which is used to perform [[melody]] lines, melodic [[fill (music)|instrumental fill passages]], and [[guitar solo|solos]].

===Hammond organ===
[[File:Hammond c3 Emilio Muñoz.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A Hammond C-3 electric organ.]]

The [[Hammond organ]] is an [[electronic organ#Early electric organs|electric organ]], invented by [[Laurens Hammond]] and John M. Hanert{{sfn|Bush|Kassel|2006|p=168}} and first manufactured in 1935.{{sfn|Corbin|2006|p=151}} Various models have been produced, most of which use sliding drawbars to create a variety of sounds. Until 1975, Hammond organs generated sound by creating an electric current from rotating a metal [[tonewheel]] near an electromagnetic pickup. Around two million Hammond organs have been manufactured, and it has been described as one of the most successful organs. The organ is commonly used with, and associated with, the [[Leslie speaker]].

The organ was originally marketed and sold by the Hammond Organ Company to [[Church (building)|churches]] as a lower-cost alternative to the wind-driven [[pipe organ]], or instead of a [[piano]]. It quickly became popular with professional [[jazz]] musicians, who found it a cheaper alternative to the [[big band]]. [[Jimmy Smith (musician)|Jimmy Smith]]'s use of the Hammond B-3, with its additional harmonic percussion feature, inspired a generation of organ players, and its use became more widespread in the 1960s and 1970s in [[rhythm and blues]], [[rock music|rock]] and [[reggae]], as well as being an important instrument in [[progressive rock]].

The Hammond Organ Company struggled financially during the 1970s as they abandoned tonewheel organs and switched to manufacturing instruments using [[integrated circuits]]. These instruments were not as popular with musicians as the tonewheels had been, and the company went out of business in 1985. The Hammond name was purchased by the [[Suzuki Musical Instrument Corporation]], which proceeded to manufacture digital simulations of the most popular tonewheel organs. This culminated in the production of the "New B-3" in 2002, which provided an accurate recreation of the original B-3 organ using modern digital technology.

Hammond-Suzuki continues to manufacture a variety of organs for both professional players and churches. Other companies, such as [[Korg]], [[Roland Corporation|Roland]] and [[Clavia]], have also achieved success in providing [[Clonewheel organ|emulations]] of the original tonewheel organs. The sound of a tonewheel Hammond can also be emulated using modern software such as [[Native Instruments]] B4.

===Electric bass===
[[File:Elbas.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Two electric basses and a [[bass amplifier]]. This amplification setup is a "bass stack" approach, in which an amplifier (in this case a Hartke 5000) is plugged into separate speaker cabinets.]]

The [[electric bass]] (or bass guitar) is a [[stringed instrument]] played primarily with the fingers or thumb, by plucking, [[Slapping (music)|slapping]], popping, strumming, tapping, thumping, or [[guitar pick|picking]] with a [[plectrum]], often known as a pick. The bass guitar is similar in appearance and construction to an [[electric guitar]], but with a longer [[neck (music)|neck]] and [[scale (string instruments)|scale]] length, and four to six [[string (music)|strings]] or [[Course (music)|courses]]. The four-string bass, by far the most common, is usually tuned the same as the [[double bass]],&lt;ref&gt;Bass guitar/Double Bass tuning E1=41.20&amp;nbsp;Hz, A1=55&amp;nbsp;Hz, D2=73.42&amp;nbsp;Hz, G2=98&amp;nbsp;Hz + optional low B0=30.87&amp;nbsp;Hz&lt;/ref&gt; which corresponds to pitches one [[octave]] lower than the four lowest pitched strings of a guitar (E, A, D, and G).&lt;ref&gt;Standard guitar tuning E2=82.41&amp;nbsp;Hz, A2=110&amp;nbsp;Hz, D3=146.8&amp;nbsp;Hz, G3=196&amp;nbsp;Hz, B3=246.9&amp;nbsp;Hz, E4=329.6&amp;nbsp;Hz&lt;/ref&gt; The bass guitar is a [[transposing instrument]], as it is notated in [[Clef#Bass clef|bass clef]] an octave higher than it sounds (as is the double bass) to avoid excessive [[ledger line]]s. Like the electric guitar, the bass guitar is plugged into an [[Bass instrument amplification|amplifier and speaker]] for live performances.

Since the 1960s, the bass guitar has largely replaced the [[double bass]] in [[popular music]] as the bass instrument in the [[rhythm section]].&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, Jim (2001). [https://books.google.com/books?id=1m2kRBQscfoC&amp;lpg=PA41&amp;pg=PA56#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 'How The Fender Bass Changed the World' p. 56] "The surf/instrumental rock genres of the early 1960s were crucial proving grounds of the still-newfangled electric bass&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;/ref&gt; While types of [[bass line]]s vary widely from one style of music to another, the bassist usually fulfills a similar role: anchoring the [[chord progression|harmonic framework]] and establishing the beat. Many styles of music utilise the bass guitar, including [[rock music|rock]], [[heavy metal music|metal]], [[pop music|pop]], [[punk rock]], [[country music|country]], [[reggae]], [[gospel music|gospel]], [[blues]], and [[jazz]]. It is often a solo [[musical instrument|instrument]] in jazz, [[jazz fusion]], [[Latin music (genre)|Latin]], [[funk]], [[progressive rock]] and other rock and metal styles.

==Electric sound recording and reproduction==
{{Main article|Sound recording and reproduction}}
Electric sound recording and reproduction are electrical or mechanical techniques and devices for the inscription and re-creation of [[sound]] waves, such as spoken voice, singing, [[instrumental music]], or sound effects. Acoustic analog recording is achieved by a small [[microphone]] diaphragm that can detect changes in atmospheric pressure ([[acoustics|acoustic]] sound waves) and record them as a graphic representation of the sound waves on a medium such as a [[phonograph]] (in which a stylus senses grooves on a record).  In [[magnetic tape]] recording, the sound waves vibrate the microphone diaphragm and are converted into a varying [[electric current]], which is then converted to a varying [[magnetic field]] by an [[electromagnet]], which makes a representation of the sound as magnetized areas on a plastic tape with a magnetic coating on it. Analog sound reproduction is the reverse process, with a bigger [[loudspeaker]] diaphragm causing changes to atmospheric pressure to form acoustic sound waves. Electrically generated signals may also be recorded directly from devices such as an [[Pick up (music technology)|electric guitar pickup]], without the use of acoustic sounds or amplifiers in the recording process (other than the need for musicians to hear herself playing during [[recording session]]).

The first device that could record actual [[sound]]s as they passed through the air (but could not play them back—the purpose was only visual study) was the [[phonautograph]], patented in 1857 by Parisian inventor [[Édouard-Léon Scott de Martinville]]. The earliest known recordings of the human voice are phonautograph recordings, called "phonautograms", made in 1857. They consist of sheets of paper with sound-wave-modulated white lines created by a vibrating stylus that cut through a coating of soot as the paper was passed under it.

===Phonograph===

====Phonograph cylinder====
{{listen
|filename=Kham Hom - Sweet Words.ogg
|title="Kham Hom" ("Sweet Words")
|description= [[Phonograph cylinder]] recording of [[Siam]]ese (Thai) musicians visiting Berlin, Germany in 1900.}}

The first practical sound recording and reproduction device was the mechanical [[phonograph cylinder]], invented by [[Thomas Edison]] in 1877 and patented in 1878.&lt;ref&gt;[http://patimg1.uspto.gov/.piw?Docid=00200521&amp;idkey=NONE Publication Images&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The invention soon spread across the globe and over the next two decades the commercial recording, distribution and sale of sound recordings became a growing new international industry, with the most popular titles selling millions of units by the early 1900s. The development of mass-production techniques enabled cylinder recordings to become a major new consumer item in industrial countries and the cylinder was the main consumer format from the late 1880s until around 1910.

====Disc phonograph====
[[File:Alexander Graham Bell's Voice.ogg|thumb|Recording of Bell's voice on a wax disc in 1885, identified in 2013 [[Volta Laboratory and Bureau#Bell.27s voice|[more details]]] ]]
[[File:Emile Berliner with phonograph.jpg|thumb|Emile Berliner with disc record gramophone]]
The next major technical development was the invention of the [[Berliner Gramophone|gramophone disc]], generally credited to [[Emile Berliner]] and commercially introduced in the United States in 1889, though others had demonstrated similar disk apparatus earlier, most notably Alexander Graham Bell in 1881.&lt;ref name=smiths1&gt;{{cite web|title=Early Sound Recording Collection and Sound Recovery Project|url=http://newsdesk.si.edu/factsheets/early-sound-recording-collection-and-sound-recovery-project|work=Smithsonian|publisher=Smithsonian|accessdate=April 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Discs were easier to manufacture, transport and store, and they had the additional benefit of being louder (marginally) than cylinders, which by necessity, were single-sided. Sales of the [[gramophone record]] overtook the cylinder ca. 1910, and by the end of World War I the disc had become the dominant commercial recording format. In various permutations, the audio disc format became the primary medium for consumer sound recordings until the end of the 20th century, and the double-sided 78 rpm shellac disc was the standard consumer music format from the early 1910s to the late 1950s.

The long-playing 33{{frac|1|3}} rpm microgroove [[Gramophone record|vinyl]] record, or "[[LP record|LP]]", was developed at Columbia Records and introduced in 1948. The short-playing but convenient 7-inch 45 rpm microgroove vinyl [[Single (music)|single]] was introduced by [[RCA Victor]] in 1949. In the US and most developed countries, the two new vinyl formats completely replaced 78 rpm shellac discs by the end of the 1950s, but in some corners of the world the "78" lingered on far into the 1960s. Vinyl was much more expensive than shellac, one of several factors that made its use for 78 rpm records very unusual, but with a long-playing disc the added cost was acceptable and the compact "45" format required very little material. Vinyl offered improved performance, both in stamping and in playback. If played with a good diamond stylus mounted in a lightweight pickup on a well-adjusted tonearm, it was long-lasting. If protected from dust, scuffs and scratches there was very little noise. Vinyl records were, over-optimistically, advertised as "unbreakable". They were not, but they were much less fragile than shellac, which had itself once been touted as "unbreakable" compared to wax cylinders.

===Electrical recording===
[[File:Rca44.png|thumb|RCA-44, a classic [[ribbon microphone]] introduced in 1932. Similar units were widely used for recording and broadcasting in the 1940s and are occasionally still used today.]]

Between the invention of the phonograph in 1877 and the advent of digital media, arguably the most important milestone in the history of sound recording was the introduction of what was then called ''electrical recording'', in which a [[microphone]] was used to convert the sound into an electrical signal that was amplified and used to actuate the recording stylus. This innovation eliminated the "horn sound" resonances characteristic of the acoustical process, produced clearer and more full-bodied recordings by greatly extending the useful range of audio frequencies, and allowed previously unrecordable distant and feeble sounds to be captured.

Sound recording began as a purely mechanical process. Except for a few crude telephone-based recording devices with no means of amplification, such as the [[Valdemar Poulsen|Telegraphone]],&lt;ref&gt;The earliest known surviving electrical recording was made on a [[Telegraphone]] magnetic recorder at the 1900 Exposition Universelle in Paris. It includes brief comments by Emperor Franz Joseph and the audio quality, ignoring dropouts and some noise of later origin, is that of a contemporary telephone.&lt;/ref&gt; it remained so until the 1920s, when several recent radio-related developments in [[electronics]] converged to revolutionize the recording process. These included improved microphones and auxiliary devices such as electronic filters, all dependent on electronic [[Amplifier|amplification]] to be of practical use in recording. In 1906, [[Lee De Forest]] invented the ''Audion'' [[triode]] vacuum tube, an electronic valve that could amplify weak electrical signals. By 1915, it was in use in long-distance telephone circuits that made conversations between New York and San Francisco practical. Refined versions of this tube were the basis of all electronic sound systems until the commercial introduction of the first [[transistor]]-based audio devices in the 1950s.

===Magnetic tape===
{{Main article|Magnetic tape sound recording}}

[[File:Magnetic-tape-acetate-vs-polyester-backing.jpg|thumb|Magnetic audio tapes: acetate base (left) and polyester base (right)]]

An important field of invention during this period was the [[tape recorder]]. [[Magnetic tape]] recording uses an amplified electrical audio signal to generate analogous variations of the magnetic field produced by a [[tape head]], which impresses corresponding variations of magnetization on the moving tape. In playback mode, the signal path is reversed, the tape head acting as a miniature [[electric generator]] as the varyingly magnetized tape passes over it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gordon|first1=Mumma|title=Recording|url=http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com.ezproxy2.library.arizona.edu/subscriber/article/grove/music/J371600?q=acetate+tape+recording&amp;search=quick&amp;pos=4&amp;_start=1#firsthit|website=Oxford Music Online|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=20 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Magnetic tape brought about sweeping changes in both radio and the recording industry. Sound could be recorded, erased and re-recorded on the same tape many times, sounds could be duplicated from tape to tape with only minor loss of quality, and recordings could now be very precisely edited by physically cutting the tape and rejoining it. Within a few years of the introduction of the first commercial tape recorder—the [[Ampex 200]] model, launched in 1948—American musician-inventor [[Les Paul]] had invented the first [[multitrack tape recorder]], ushering in another technical revolution in the recording industry. Tape made possible the first sound recordings totally created by electronic means, opening the way for the bold sonic experiments of the [[Musique Concrète]] school and avant garde composers like [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]], which in turn led to the innovative pop music recordings of artists such as [[Frank Zappa]], [[The Beatles]] and [[The Beach Boys]].

The ease and accuracy of tape editing, as compared to the cumbersome disc-to-disc editing procedures previously in some limited use, together with tape's consistently high audio quality finally convinced radio networks to routinely prerecord their entertainment programming, most of which had formerly been broadcast live. Also, for the first time, broadcasters, regulators and other interested parties were able to undertake comprehensive audio logging of each day's radio broadcasts. Innovations like multitracking and [[Delay (audio effect)|tape echo]] allowed radio programs and advertisements to be produced to a high level of complexity and sophistication. The combined impact with innovations such as the endless loop [[broadcast cartridge]] led to significant changes in the pacing and production style of radio program content and advertising.

===Stereo and hi-fi===
{{See also|Stereophonic sound|High fidelity}}

Magnetic tape enabled the development of the first practical commercial sound systems that could record and reproduce high-fidelity [[stereophonic sound]]. The experiments with stereo during the 1930s and 1940s were hampered by problems with synchronization. A major breakthrough in practical stereo sound was made by [[Bell Laboratories]], who in 1937 demonstrated a practical system of two-channel stereo, using dual optical sound tracks on film. Major movie studios quickly developed three-track and four-track sound systems, and the first stereo sound recording for a commercial film was made by [[Judy Garland]] for the [[MGM]] movie ''[[Listen, Darling]]'' in 1938.

The first commercially released movie with a stereo soundtrack was Walt Disney's ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]'', released in 1940.  The 1941 release of Fantasia used the "[[Fantasound]]" sound system. This system used a separate film for the sound, synchronized with the film carrying the picture. The sound film had four double-width optical soundtracks, three for left, center, and right audio—and a fourth as a "control" track with three recorded tones that controlled the playback volume of the three audio channels. Because of the complex equipment this system required, Disney exhibited the movie as a roadshow, and only in the United States.  Regular releases of the movie used standard mono optical 35&amp;nbsp;mm stock until 1956, when Disney released the film with a stereo soundtrack that used the "[[Cinemascope]]" four-track magnetic sound system.

EMI (UK) was the first company to release commercial stereophonic tapes. They issued their first ''Stereosonic'' tape in 1954. Others quickly followed, under the His Master's Voice and Columbia labels.  161 Stereosonic tapes were released, mostly classical music or lyric recordings. RCA imported these tapes into the US. Two-track stereophonic tapes were more successful in America during the second half of the 1950s.  They were duplicated at real time (1:1) or at twice the normal speed (2:1) when later 4-track tapes were often duplicated at up to 16 times the normal speed, providing a lower sound quality in many cases.  Early American 2-track stereophonic tapes were very expensive.  A typical example is the price list of the Sonotape/Westminster reels:  $6.95, $11.95 and $17.95 for the 7000, 9000 and 8000 series respectively.  Some HMV tapes released in the USA also cost up to $15. Record companies mixed most popular music singles into monophonic sound until the mid-1960s—then commonly released major recordings in both mono and stereo until the early 1970s. Many Sixties pop albums now available only in stereo were originally released only in mono, and record companies produced the "stereo" versions of these albums by simply separating the two tracks of the master tape.

Magnetic tape transformed the recording industry. By the early 1950s, most commercial recordings were mastered on tape instead of recorded directly to disc. Tape facilitated a degree of manipulation in the recording process that was impractical with mixes and multiple generations of directly recorded discs. An early example is [[Les Paul]]'s 1951 recording of ''[[How High the Moon]]'', on which Paul played eight overdubbed guitar tracks. In the 1960s [[Brian Wilson]] of [[The Beach Boys]], [[Frank Zappa]], and [[The Beatles]] (with producer [[George Martin]]) were among the first popular artists to explore the possibilities of [[multitrack recording]] techniques and effects on their landmark albums ''[[Pet Sounds]]'', ''[[Freak Out!]]'', and ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]''.

The compact cassette became a major consumer audio format and advances in electronic and mechanical miniaturization led to the development of the [[Sony]] [[Walkman]], a pocket-sized cassette player introduced in 1979. The Walkman was the first personal music player and it gave a major boost to sales of prerecorded cassettes, which became the first widely successful release format that used a re-recordable medium: the vinyl&lt;!-- avoids BE/AE differences --&gt; record was a playback-only medium and commercially prerecorded tapes for [[reel-to-reel audio tape recording|reel-to-reel tape decks]], which many consumers found difficult to operate, were never more than an uncommon niche market item.

'''Natural religion''' most frequently means the "religion of nature", in which God, the soul, spirits, and all objects of the supernatural are considered as part of [[nature]] and not separate from it. Conversely, it is also used in [[philosophy]], specifically Roman Catholic philosophy, to describe some aspects of religion that are said to be knowable apart from divine revelation through logic and reason alone (see [[natural theology]] and [[Deism]]), for example, the existence of the [[God|unmoved Mover]], the [[first cause]] of the universe.

Most authors{{who|date=September 2018}} consider natural religion as not only the foundation of monotheistic religions such as Judaism, Christianity, and Islam but also distinct from them. According to some authors{{who|date=September 2018}}, aspects of natural religion are found universally among all peoples, often in such forms of [[shamanism]] and [[animism]]. They are still practiced in many parts of the world. The religions of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] societies for example are considered as possessing some aspects of natural religion.

==Definition==

Natural religion might have the following meanings:

* In the modern [[Religious studies|study of religion]] it is used to refer to the notion that there is a spontaneous religious apprehension of the world common to all human beings, see:
**[[urreligion]]
**[[origin of religion]]
**[[anthropology of religion]]
* As a reverent form of [[nature worship]], embodied in a statement by [[Frank Lloyd Wright]]: "I put a capital N on Nature, and call it my Church."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hrc.utexas.edu/multimedia/video/2008/wallace/wright_frank_lloyd_t.html |title=Frank Lloyd Wright |publisher=[[The Mike Wallace Interview]] |year=1957 |website=[[Harry Ransom Center]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Referring to the religions of people prior to their [[Christianization]].

==History==

The basic tenets of natural religion were outlined by [[Aristotle]], whose ''hylomorphism'' considered all things as made of matter and form. The form of all living things is the [[soul]], which guides and directs their development. Many natural religions{{which|date=September 2018}} consider God as the "soul of the universe".

Early [[monotheism]] had many naturalistic elements. Heaven and hell were considered physical places above and below the earth. "Salvation" was considered resurrection of the body.

In the fourth century, Christians were concerned that Jesus had not returned and wondered what happened to those who died before the Second Coming of Christ. Christians, led by [[Augustine of Hippo]] and under the influence of both [[gnosticism]] and [[neoplatonism]], developed a new belief in the soul as capable of a separate existence abstract from the material world. The human souls, unlike those of animals, would survive death and, depending on God's judgment, be transferred to the non-material realms of heaven or hell and the new realm of [[limbo]] for unbaptized persons and [[purgatory]] for those who do not deserve hell but are not purified for heaven..

Another distinction from monotheism is found in the Christian belief in miracles, in which God intervenes in history from outside nature. Ancient Roman philosophers and others since objected to this Christian doctrine as God violating his own natural laws. Christians had to separate God more completely from the natural universe in order to show how this could be possible. There were similar neoplatonist tendencies in Judaism and Islam, which also saw God as acting in history.

Natural religions, on the contrary, consider the supernatural as part of the natural universe.

==Modern views==
One of the first attempts to develop a science of religion was ''[[The Varieties of Religious Experience]]'' by the American philosopher [[William James]].  James saw the basic experience which unified all religions as a sometimes life-changing personal event in which one perceives the connectedness of all things as one unified whole.

James defined the basics of all religion, including natural religion, when he wrote: "Were one to characterize the life of religion in the broadest and most general terms possible, one might say that it exists of the belief that there is an unseen order, and that our supreme good lies in harmoniously adjusting ourselves hereto."

Certain aspects of natural religion (that is, religious truths that are knowable by human reason alone) are found among different cultures, though not always entirely intact, and to varying degrees, according to philosophers such as [[Thomas Aquinas]] and [[Nicolas Malebranche|Malebranche]].

A few modern scientists such as UK biologist [[Rupert Sheldrake]] believe new discoveries coincide with Aristotle's belief in the soul. Forces such as [[magnetism]], [[gravity]], and [[quantum mechanics]] also point to non-material forces acting in nature.&lt;ref&gt;2012. Sheldrake, R. '''Set Science Free: 10 Paths to New Discoveries.''' Depak Chopra.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nesting Orientalisms''' is a concept introduced by Milica Bakić-Hayden, a [[visiting lecturer]] at the [[University of Pittsburgh]]. It is based on gradation of "Orients", i.e. otherness and primitiveness.

== Background ==
As developed by Milica Bakić-Hayden, '''Nesting Orientalisms''' is a conceptual variant of [[Edward Said]]'s theory of [[Orientalism (book)|Orientalism]]; an additional influence is [[Larry Wolff]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Ashbrook  |first=John E |editor= |editorn= |editorn-last= |editorn-first= |editor-link= |editorn-link= |others= |title=Buying and selling the Istrian goat : Istrian regionalism, Croatian nationalism, and EU enlargement |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uk9VVZ1esGwC&amp;pg=PA22&amp;dq=%22Nesting+Orientalisms%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=GuBcTr_SG86N-wbg94HuAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Nesting%20Orientalisms%22&amp;f=false |accessdate= |edition= |series= |origyear= |year=2008 |publisher=Peter Lang |location=New York |isbn=90-5201-391-8 |oclc=213599021 |doi-inactive-date=|bibcode= |id= |page=22 |nopp= |at= |chapter= |chapterurl= |quote=Milica Bakić-Hayden built on Wolff's work, incorporating ideas from Edward Said's ''Orientalism'' |laysummary= |laydate= |postscript= |lastauthoramp= |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt; but, in fact, she already had used the term ‘Nesting Orientalism’ in the article ‘Orientalist Variations on the Theme “Balkans”: Symbolic Geography in Recent Yugoslav Cultural Politics” (1992), co-author Robert Hayden, before Wolff published ''Inventing Eastern Europe''.&lt;ref&gt;Milica Bakic-Hayden and Robert Hayden, "Orientalist Variations on the Theme "Balkans": Symbolic Geography in Recent Yugoslav Cultural Politics" Slavic review, vol. 51, no. 1 (Spring 1992), p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

== The concept ==

This concept explains "a tendency of each region to view the cultures and religions to its South and East as more conservative and primitive".&lt;ref name="Petrović 2009 141"&gt;{{cite book|last=Petrović|first=Tanja|title=Kulturen der Differenz – Transformationsprozesse in Zentraleuropa nach 1989  transdisziplinäre Perspektiven|year=2009|publisher=Vienna Univ. Press|isbn=3-89971-714-7|editor=Heinz Fassmann|page=141}}&lt;/ref&gt; It explains how a group which creates the Orientalized other can also be the subject of Orientalization by another group, and so on.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Cela|first=Alba|title=‘Orientalism’ in service of Contemporary National Identity Building in Albania: The literary work of Ismail Kadare.|url=http://web.ceu.hu/nation/theses/Cela.pdf|accessdate=|edition=|series=|origyear=|year=2006|publisher=Central European University Nationalism Studies Program|location=Budapest, Hungary|isbn=|oclc=|doi-inactive-date=|bibcode=|id=|page=18|nopp=|at=|chapter=|chapterurl=|quote=Milica Bakic-Hayden’s work on “Nesting Orientalisms”... exposed how the project of creating a necessary other sometimes involves the Orientalization of one group by another, who has been in turn Orientalized by another, and so on.|laysummary=|laydate=|postscript=|lastauthoramp=|ref=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003122409/http://web.ceu.hu/nation/theses/Cela.pdf|archivedate=3 October 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to this concept Asia is more "east" or "other" than Eastern Europe. Within Eastern Europe the [[Balkans]] is perceived as most "eastern". Such hierarchy continues within the Balkans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Harrington  |first=Carol |author2=Ayman Salem |author3=Tamara Zurabishvili |title=After communism : critical perspectives on society and sociology |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fNejIRHgCyIC&amp;pg=PA84&amp;dq=%22Nesting+Orientalisms%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=GuBcTr_SG86N-wbg94HuAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Nesting%20Orientalisms%22&amp;f=false |accessdate= |edition= |series= |origyear= |location= |isbn=978-0-8204-6951-5 |oclc=56334118 |doi-inactive-date=|bibcode= |id= |page=84 |quote=...Hayden very interestingly introduced the idea of 'nesting Orientalism', which contains the process of descending East/West exclusion: "The gradation of 'Orients' that I call 'nesting Orientalisms' is a pattern of reproduction of the original dichotomy upon which the Orientalism is premised.  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nesting Balkanisms ===
In the case of the Balkans there are many rankings connected with this concept, which "play a significant role in . . . [[Identity (social science)|identity]] building [and proclaiming] a more prestigious position within a generally negatively assessed entity".&lt;ref name=Ethnologia37&gt;{{Citation |last=Elchinova |first= Magdalena |editor= |editorn= |editorn-last= |editorn-first= |editor-link= |editorn-link= |others= |title=Bulgaria's Way to Europe: Some Aspects of Identity Construction Among Bulgarian Students Today |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=0ogSzrXJEfMC&amp;pg=PA37&amp;dq=%22Nesting+Orientalisms%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=UUddToTxDOSk4AT93pUm&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAjgK#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Nesting%20Orientalisms%22&amp;f=false |accessdate= |edition= |series=Ethnologia Balkanica |volume=8 |origyear= |year= 2004 |publisher=Prof. M. Drinov Academic Pub. House |location= Sofia |isbn= |oclc=41714232 |doi-inactive-date=|bibcode= |id= |page=37 |nopp= |at= |chapter= |chapterurl= |quote=[C]f. the idea of 'nesting orientalisms' in Bakic-Hayden 1995, and the related concept of 'nesting balkanisms' in Todorova 1997 ... The dynamic nature of 'Europe' and 'the Balkans' is even more salient when the two are regarded as identity constructions. As such, they are still opposed to each other (Todorova 1997:19) for the Balkans are not alien to Europe, they are its 'darker side'|laysummary= |laydate= |postscript= |lastauthoramp= |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Proclaiming one's European character was a tool in creating the pattern of "nesting orientalisms" in the Balkans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last= Biehl |first= Peter F. |editor= |editorn= |editorn-last= |editorn-first= |editor-link= |editorn-link= |others= |title=Archäologien Europas: Geschichte, Methoden und Theorien |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Iqewqjc22igC&amp;pg=PA316&amp;dq=%22Nesting+Orientalisms%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=pVldTqCkIPT04QTKmaEd&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwADgo#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Nesting%20Orientalisms%22&amp;f=false |accessdate= |edition= |series= |origyear= |publisher=Waxmann  |isbn=978-3-8309-1067-1 |oclc= |doi-inactive-date=|bibcode= |id= |page=316 |nopp= |at= |chapter= |chapterurl= |quote=The renegotiation of the European character of the Balkan peoples was the major issue among the conflicting parties, and a device in constructing the pattern of 'nesting orientalisms' mentioned above (Bakić-Hayden...) |laysummary= |laydate= |postscript= |lastauthoramp= |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hence, Bulgarian historian [[Maria Todorova]] introduced the related concept of "nesting balkanisms".&lt;ref name=Ethnologia37/&gt; Todorova emphasized the importance of this concept in identity constructions, which in the case of the Balkans involve the dual perception of the Balkans as a part of Europe but also as in opposition, as the "darker side" of Europe.&lt;ref name=Ethnologia37/&gt;

=== Nesting Colonialisms ===

Another concept related to the concept of nesting orientalisms was introduced by Tanja Petrović, a [[Serbs|Serbian]] [[Anthropology|anthropologist]] from [[Slovenia]]: that of "nesting colonialisms", which is marked by parallels and analogies of the [[European Union]] and the rest of the world, which are perceived as former colonial powers and former colonies. This concept provides members of European Union, no matter whether they had a colonial past or not, with a "pool" of discursive patterns used for exclusion of those who are outside the European Union.&lt;ref name="Petrović 2009 141"/&gt;

=== Nesting Occidentalisms ===

Bulgarian intellectuals have modified the concept of Nesting Orientalisms into the reversed concept of ''Nesting Occidentalisms''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bracewell|first=Wendy|title=Balkan Departures: Travel Writing from South-Eastern Europe|year=2009|publisher=Berghahn|location=New York|isbn=1-84545-254-2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dCb4_3H6yjkC&amp;pg=PA111&amp;lpg=PA111&amp;dq=%22nesting+occidentalisms%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ysRGvoXMRf&amp;sig=Ee2z3xuTCstOBgAWDvkGnAl9eSk&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=KixeTrDaLsbb4QSL2Jke&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBcQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22nesting%20occidentalisms%22&amp;f=false|author2=Alex Drace-Francis|accessdate=31 August 2011|page=111|quote=Milica Bakić Hayden speaks of "nesting Orientalisms". Bulgarian intellectuals ... appear to have ... adopted a reversed version of her model. They approach Europe in terms of 'nesting Occidentalisms' or a 'gradation of Occidents'. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of nesting occidentalisms is present in the 2006 [[mockumentary]] ''[[Borat]]'', which exploits foreign and domestic hierarchies of [[Americans]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Hall|first=Richard Andrew|editor=|editorn=|editorn-last=|editorn-first=|editor-link=|editorn-link=|others=|title=BORAT: ORIENTALIST SATIRE FOR MAKE GLORIOUS DEBATE WESTERN INTELLIGENTSIYA|url=http://homepage.mac.com/khallbobo/RichardHall/pubs/boratslavicreview022807.pdf|accessdate=|edition=|series=|origyear=|location=|isbn=|oclc=|doi-inactive-date=|bibcode=|id=|nopp=|at=|chapter=|chapterurl=|quote=Borat! is replete with what might be called 'nesting occidentalisms' or 'nesting antiAmericanisms':  that is, it creates and plays on foreign and domestic hierarchies of Americans, good, bad, and ugly|laysummary=|laydate=|postscript=|lastauthoramp=|ref=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305073153/http://homepage.mac.com/khallbobo/RichardHall/pubs/boratslavicreview022807.pdf|archivedate=5 March 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''political faction''' is a group of individuals within a larger entity, such as a [[political party]], a [[trade union]] or other group, or simply a [[political climate]], united by a particular common political purpose that differs in some respect to the rest of the entity. A faction or political party may include fragmented sub-factions, "parties within a party," which may be referred to as power blocs, or voting blocs. Members of factions band together as a way of achieving these goals and advancing their agenda and position within an organisation.

Factions are not limited to political parties; they can and frequently do form within any group that has some sort of political aim or purpose.

The Latin word ''factio'' denoted originally either of the chariot teams that were organised professionally by private companies in ancient Rome, each recognisable by characteristic colour and arousing supporter hysteria similar to that in modern sports fans. These teams were not unlike gladiator schools, but the lethal nature of that entertainment meant few performers lasted long enough to build up similar crowd loyalty to the "team", while the fighters rarely actually teamed up, but rather fought duels or beasts. In time, political currents could become associated with such a team, although precisely how this happened is unclear. In Byzantine Constantinople, two such chariot factions, blue and green, repeatedly made or broke the claims of candidates to the imperial throne.

Occasionally, the term "faction" is still used more or less as a synonym for political party, but "with opprobrious sense, conveying the imputation of selfish or mischievous ends or turbulent or unscrupulous methods", according to the Oxford English Dictionary. In his Dictionary, Samuel Johnson (a [[Tory]]) dismissively defined [[Whigs (British political party)|Whig]] as "the name of a faction". Similarly, in the tenth instalment of The Federalist Papers, [[James Madison]] defines a faction as "a number of citizens, whether amounting to a minority or majority of the whole, who are united and actuated by some common impulse of passion, or of interest, adverse to the rights of other citizens, or to the permanent and aggregate interests of the community." In plain English this is a group that pursues self-interest at the expense of the greater good.

==Aims of factions==
The aims of a political faction are as diverse as the different types of bodies within which they appear. Typically, however, they include: advancing a particular [[policy]] or policy agenda, preventing the adoption of alternative policies and supporting given individuals to positions of power within the organisation or in the wider political world.  A faction can primarily be based around supporting a given person or group, or a single major aim, with little in the way of common agenda otherwise, or it can have a comprehensive and definitive set of policies.  Either way, factional politics typically revolve around personality, with a few individuals playing key roles, acting as a magnet for like-minded people, leading the activities of the faction, and acting as a prominent voice for the shared objectives of the faction. Such individuals can be referred to by a variety of names, such as “powerbrokers” or “factional chiefs”.

==Organisation==
&lt;!--Please DO NOT change the spelling of "organisation" to "organization". See [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style#National varieties of English]].--&gt;
Factions differ in the amount of organisation and internal structure they possess. On the left, these may take the form of tendencies or [[platform (European politics)|platforms]]. Most factions are very loose organisations, having no definitive list of members, but some factions, have a formal internal structure, with membership lists, regular meetings, official positions – such as negotiators, conveners, [[whip (politics)|whips]] and organisers, – and a definitive policy position on every issue affecting the broader organisation. Such factions will typically be binding; that is, they rely upon all members casting their votes in accordance with the pre-ordained official stance of the faction.

==Operation of factions==
In political organisations that are [[democracy|democratic]] in structure, factions rely heavily on securing enough votes to win important ballots. This process is sometimes referred to as “doing the numbers”. Having the numbers will allow the faction to push policies it supports and elect its members to powerful positions within the broader organisation.

If one faction develops within an organisation, there will usually be at least one other that develops in opposition to it. Opposing factions will try to match each other's level of organisation and internal discipline, but will also engage in negotiations and trade-offs to ensure that the organisation’s activities are not compromised and that every group has a chance to obtain at least some of its goals.

Key to the operation of an organised faction is the existence of a power base. This will typically be some office, division or branch of the broader organisation over which the faction has effective control. Sometimes a power base may be an external or affiliated organisation that is involved with the broader organisation in some way.

A power base serves several key functions:
* It acts as a recruitment centre for new members, and promotes homogeneity within the membership (crucial for maintaining factional cohesion);
* It can be used as an organising centre for factional events and activities;
* It functions as a springboard, advancing the career of selected factional members and allowing them to gain skills that will increase their effectiveness and clout.

==Effects of factions==
The existence of a factional system can have serious negative consequences for a political organisation.  If factional strife becomes intensive and public, the organisation may suffer from perceptions of disunity. Taken one step further, if the conflict is particularly severe, it may cause ruptures within the organisation that seriously impede its effectiveness, leading to break-up or collapse of the organisation.

To avoid harm to the organisation, factional operations are usually conducted under strong secrecy and with minimal public scrutiny. This, however, can lead to the proliferation of unethical behaviour. Warfare between the factions may lead to tactics such as ballot box-stuffing, stack-outs, membership fraud, and other generally fraudulent conduct. Individuals who abandon a faction may be subject to intense personal [[Feud|vendettas]] where their former comrades go about sabotaging their careers.  A climate of intense factional conflict can also motivate individuals to focus on attacking their factional enemies rather than furthering the broader organisation.

Despite this, the benefits of factional systems are often overlooked. It is often incomprehensible to outsiders why members of a broader organisation would engage in factionalism. This stems from the assumption that the natural factional relationship is one of conflict and strife, when in fact, factions are often able to engage in productive co-operation.

In any political organisation there are likely to be many highly opinionated and passionate people. The existence of a factional system allows its operations to be more predictable and stable. Compromise and give-and-take between factions allows the organisation to operate without having to satisfy the whims of many different, uncompromising individuals who might otherwise cause a split. So, somewhat counter-intuitively, factionalism can actually promote organisational harmony.

Factions also help to broaden and diversify the organisation’s appeal. A person who might otherwise find the organisation’s goals unattractive might be persuaded to support a faction within it whose goals are closer to their own. Just as a democratic [[government]] is often invigorated by a strong [[Parliamentary Opposition|opposition]], so having a number of distinct points-of-view with an organisation can energise it and allow it to perform its role more effectively. It is also highly unlikely that any sizeable political organisation is wholly united in purpose, so arguably factions simply represent a way of managing pre-existing differences within the organisation.

The Founding Fathers of the American constitution, explicitly warned against the dangers of party factionalism. Madison, Hamilton, and Washington expressed the belief that factions would create divides that would ultimately dismantle the government. These sentiments can be found in ''[[The Federalist Papers]]'', specifically Federalist 10 and 51 written by Madison.

'''Public water system''' is a regulatory term used in the United States and Canada, referring to certain [[Public utility|utilities]] and organizations providing [[drinking water]].

==United States==
The US [[Safe Drinking Water Act]] and derivative legislation define "public water system" as an entity that provides "[[Drinking water|water for human consumption]] through pipes or other constructed conveyances to at least 15 service connections or serves an average of at least 25 people for at least 60 days a year."&lt;ref name="SDWA background"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/dwstandardsregulations/background-drinking-water-standards-safe-drinking-water-act-sdwa |title=Background on Drinking Water Standards in the Safe Drinking Water Act |date=2015-12-23 |publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) |location=Washington, DC}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "public" in "public water system" refers to the people drinking the water, not to the ownership of the system.

Some US states (e.g. [[New York (state)|New York]]) have varying definitions.
&lt;!-- The [[European Union]] appears to have a different definition for "public water '''supply'''": a water supply which is in the charge or ownership of a sanitary authority or any person acting jointly with it or on its behalf under contract.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fsai.ie/legislation/food/eu_docs/Water/SI278_2007.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;

Over 286 million Americans get their tap water from a community water system. Eight percent of the community water systems—large municipal water systems—provide water to 82 percent of the US population.&lt;ref name="CDCPWS"&gt;U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Atlanta, GA (2013-04-04). [https://www.cdc.gov/healthywater/drinking/public/index.html "Public Water Systems."]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Subcategorization===
The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) has defined three types of public water systems:
* '''Community Water System''' (CWS). A public water system that supplies water to the same population year-round.
* '''Non-Transient Non-Community Water System''' (NTNCWS). A public water system that regularly supplies water to at least 25 of the same people at least six months per year, but not year-round. Some examples are schools, factories, office buildings, and [[hospital]]s which have their own water systems.
* '''Transient Non-Community Water System''' (TNCWS). A public water system that provides water in a place such as a [[gas station]] or [[campground]] where people do not remain for long periods of time.

There are over 150,000 public water systems.
* Approximately 52,000 CWS serve the majority of the U.S. population
* Approximately 85,000 NTNCWS
* Approximately 18,000 TNCWS.&lt;ref name="SDWA background"/&gt;

EPA also classifies water systems according to the number of people they serve:
* Very Small water systems serve 25-500 people
* Small water systems serve 501-3,300 people
* Medium water systems serve 3,301-10,000 people
* Large water systems serve 10,001-100,000 people
* Very Large water systems serve over 100,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://echo.epa.gov/help/drinking-water-dashboard-help |title=Drinking Water Dashboard Help |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2016-01-05 |website=Enforcement and Compliance History Online |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Water systems may be categorized by their source of water:
*[[Groundwater]], generally from [[Water well|wells]]
*[[Surface water]] and groundwater "under the influence" of surface water
*Purchase of water from another Public Water System.

===Water-related diseases and contaminants in public water systems===
Sources of drinking water are subject to contamination and require appropriate treatment to remove disease-causing contaminants. Contamination of drinking water supplies can occur in the source water as well as in the distribution system after water treatment has already occurred. There are many sources of water contamination, including naturally occurring chemicals and minerals (for example, [[arsenic]], [[radon]], [[uranium]]), local land use practices (application of [[fertilizer]]s and [[pesticide]]s; [[concentrated animal feeding operation]]s), manufacturing processes, and [[Sewer overflow (disambiguation)|sewer overflow]]s&lt;!--intentional link to DAB page--&gt; or [[water pollution|wastewater]] releases.

The presence of contaminants in water can lead to adverse health effects, including gastrointestinal illness, reproductive problems, and neurological disorders. Infants, young children, pregnant women, the elderly, and people whose immune systems are compromised because of AIDS, chemotherapy, or transplant medications, may be especially susceptible to illness from some contaminants.&lt;ref&gt;CDC (2013). [https://www.cdc.gov/healthywater/drinking/public/water_diseases.html "Water-related Diseases and Contaminants in Public Water Systems."]&lt;/ref&gt;

The US [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] publishes a list of the leading causes of waterborne outbreaks in public water systems.&lt;ref name="CDCPWS" /&gt;

==Canada==
The Canadian provinces of [[Manitoba]] and [[Nova Scotia]] also use this definition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Province of Manitoba|location=Winnipeg, MB|url=http://web2.gov.mb.ca/laws/statutes/ccsm/d101e.php|title=The Drinking Water Safety Act|accessdate=2009-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Province of Nova Scotia|location=Halifax, NS|url=http://www.gov.ns.ca/JUST/REGULATIONS/regs/envwaste.htm|title=Water and Wastewater Facilities and Public Drinking Water Supplies Regulations|accessdate=2009-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Pupil Achievement Tracker (PAT)''' is a [[pupil tracking system]] produced by the [[DfES]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schools.bedfordshire.gov.uk/im/PAT/index.htm Pupil Assessment Tracker&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070701064153/http://www.schools.bedfordshire.gov.uk/im/pat/index.htm |date=2007-07-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It allows schools and LEAs to import their own pupil performance data and compare it with national performance data.

As part of the [[New Relationship with Schools]], [[Ofsted]] and [[DfES]] are streamlining data analysis in schools by merging [[Performance and Assessment (PANDA)|PANDA]] with PAT to produce new online product called RAISEOnline.

'''Reporting and Analysis for Improvement through School Self-Evaluation (RAISE)'''

RAISEonline&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.raiseonline.org RAISEonline&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; is a new web-based system which disseminates [[school performance data]] and will replace the current [[Ofsted]] [[Performance and Assessment (PANDA)]] reports and the DfES Pupil Achievement Tracker (PAT) in 2007 to coincide with the availability of 2006 validated [[National Curriculum (England, Wales and Northern Ireland)|National Curriculum]] data.

The '''quiff''' is a [[hairstyle]] that combines the 1950s [[Pompadour (hairstyle)|pompadour]] hairstyle, the 1950s [[flattop]], and sometimes a [[Mohawk hairstyle|mohawk]].  The hairstyle was a staple in the British '[[Teddy Boy]]' movement, but became popular again in Europe in the early 1980s and faced a resurgence in popularity during the [[1990s in fashion|1990s]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Top 6: Timeless Hairstyles|url=http://uk.askmen.com/top_10/entertainment/top-6-timeless-hairstyles_5.html|page=5|first=Farah|last=Averill|publisher=Ziff Davis|website=UK.AskMen.com|accessdate=2014-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin of the word==
The etymology of the word "quiff" is uncertain, and several proposals have been suggested for its origin.

* It may owe its origin to the French word ''coiffe'', which can mean either a hairstyle or, going further back, the [[Mail (armour)|mail]] that [[knight]]s wore over their heads and under their helmets. 
* Another possible candidate for its origin is the Dutch word ''kuif'', meaning "crest". The Dutch name for [[Tintin (character)|Tintin]], who sports a quiff, is ''Kuifje'', which is the diminutive of the same word.

==Styles==
The modern-day quiff includes plenty of hair at the front of the top of the head, receding into shorter hair at the back with a trimmed back and sides.

The [[Japanese people|Japanese]] [[punch perm]], a favorite among [[yakuza]] (organized criminals) and [[bōsōzoku]] (biker gangs), is similar to the quiff.

"'''Save the World'''" is a song by English musician [[George Harrison]], released as the final track of his 1981 album ''[[Somewhere in England]]''. It was also the [[B-side]] of "[[Teardrops (George Harrison song)|Teardrops]]", which was the second single off the album. An environmental [[protest song]], "Save the World" was Harrison's first composition to directly address topical issues such as the nuclear arms race, rainforest and wildlife devastation, and the ecologically irresponsible practices of corporate concerns. Musically, the song partly recalls the style of the comedy troupe [[Monty Python]].

Harrison recorded "Save the World" at his [[Friar Park]] studio in England in 1980. The recording includes sound effects that support the song's message of a world heading towards self-destruction, including bombs falling, a cash register, a street demonstration, and a nuclear explosion. In 1985, Harrison contributed a version of the song with amended lyrics to [[Greenpeace]]'s [[Greenpeace – The Album|self-titled fundraising album]]. "Save the World" also appeared on the home video ''Greenpeace: Non-Toxic Video Hits''.

Since its release, the song has been held in low regard by several music critics and biographers. Some of these reviewers highlight the disparity between the serious message and the quirky musical backing. In line with Harrison's wishes, a demo of "Save the World" appeared as the sole bonus track on the posthumously reissued ''Somewhere in England'' in 2004.

==Background and inspiration==
As reproduced in the 2017 book ''[[I, Me, Mine|I, Me, Mine – The Extended Edition]]'', [[George Harrison]] dated the lyrics of "Save the World" to 24 February 1978, with [[Hana, Maui]] as the location.&lt;ref name="IMM p 434"&gt;Harrison, p. 434.&lt;/ref&gt; During that visit to Hawaii, Harrison completed the writing for his 1979 album ''[[George Harrison (album)|George Harrison]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Rodriguez, pp. 175, 365–66.&lt;/ref&gt; which, as with its predecessor, ''[[Thirty Three &amp; 1/3]]'', reflected a light-heartedness that had been lacking in much of his work.&lt;ref&gt;Madinger &amp; Easter, p. 457.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Woffinden, pp. 103, 106.&lt;/ref&gt; He returned to the song when working on his album ''[[Somewhere in England]]'', most of which was written between mid 1979 and the early part of 1980.&lt;ref name="Madinger &amp; Easter p 459"&gt;Madinger &amp; Easter, p. 459.&lt;/ref&gt; As with a track Harrison wrote for ''Somewhere in England'', "[[Tears of the World]]",&lt;ref&gt;Inglis, pp. 77, 103.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leng, pp. 221, 226.&lt;/ref&gt; "Save the World" conveys his disapproval at the ecological issues and political machinations threatening the world in the early 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Allison, pp. 70–71.&lt;/ref&gt;

During 1980, Harrison became a member of [[Greenpeace]] and [[CND]];&lt;ref&gt;Leng, p. 214.&lt;/ref&gt; he also protested against the use of nuclear energy with [[Friends of the Earth]], in London,&lt;ref&gt;Badman, p. 248.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harry, p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt; and helped finance ''[[Vole (magazine)|Vole]]'', a [[Green politics|green]] magazine launched by [[Monty Python]] member [[Terry Jones]].&lt;ref name="Clayson p 388" /&gt; Author Simon Leng describes "Save the World" as Harrison's first attempt at ecology-focused songwriting and a "quirky [[protest song]]" that marked "the culmination of the Pythonization of Harrison's music" at a time when he was increasingly associated with members of the Monty Python comedy troupe through his film company [[HandMade Films]]. While recognising "Save the World" as indicative of its composer's disillusion with the 1980s, Leng comments that Harrison had long valued the "madness" of Monty Python's comedy as "a mirror to the insanity of world events", and that his adoption of humour was a "peculiarly British" reaction to a grave situation.&lt;ref name="Leng p 226" /&gt;

==Composition==
In his lyrics, Harrison sings of "This planet's rape, how we've abused it".&lt;ref&gt;''Somewhere in England'' CD booklet ([[Dark Horse Records]], 2004; produced by George Harrison &amp; Ray Cooper), p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; He first addresses the [[nuclear arms race]] being waged between the United States and the [[Soviet Union]], and laments the introduction of intergalactic weapons. He then addresses the devastation of the world's rainforests for commercial gain and the threat to wildlife. He refers to the [[Anti-whaling#Save the Whales|Save the Whales]] environmental campaign and how Greenpeace's attempts to limit whale hunting had been thwarted by the interests of "dog food salesmen". He also laments the irresponsibility of arms manufacturers and, with regard to [[plutonium]] stockpiles, concludes: "Now you can make your own H-bomb / Right in the kitchen with your mom." He then denigrates the use of nuclear power as a "half-wit's answer to a need" that causes cancer. In the final verse, Harrison attributes the world's environmental problems to just a few profit-seeking individuals. He ends on what he promises to be "a happy note" by stating that a simple solution lies in the realisation that "God [lives] in your heart".&lt;ref name="Leng p 226" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Allison, pp. 75–76.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 1987 interview, Harrison said that "Save the World" was meant to be "serious and funny at the same time".&lt;ref&gt;Allison, p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. Kordosh, "Fab! Gear! The George Harrison Interview (part 1)", ''[[Creem]]'', December 1987; available at [http://www.rocksbackpages.com/Library/Article/fab-gear-the-george-harrison-interview-part-1 Rock's Backpages] (subscription required).&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=nb|His handwritten lyrics include a verse that was omitted from the published song: "Those people in the military / All need a dose of LSD / Then send them to a yoga class / To find their souls [and] forget their ass."&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, pp. 434, 436.&lt;/ref&gt;}} Contrasting with the subject matter, the music recalls the comedy songs of Monty Python.&lt;ref name="Leng p 226"&gt;Leng, p. 226.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Allison, pp. 70, 153.&lt;/ref&gt; In the description of Harrison biographer [[Alan Clayson]], the style is "quasi-reggae",&lt;ref name="Clayson p 381"&gt;Clayson, p. 381.&lt;/ref&gt; while author Ian Inglis refers to it being sung on the official recording "in a deceptively sweet voice to a [[March (music)|march]] tempo".&lt;ref name="Inglis p 77"&gt;Inglis, p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt; Leng also likens the song's musical aspects to Harrison's 1975 tribute to comedian [[Legs Larry Smith]], "[[His Name Is Legs (Ladies and Gentlemen)]]", in terms of its [[Groove (music)|groove]] and musical arrangement.&lt;ref name="Leng p 226" /&gt;

==Recording==
Harrison recorded "Save the World" during the main sessions for ''Somewhere in England'', held at his [[FPSHOT]] studio in [[Henley-on-Thames|Henley]], Oxfordshire, between March and September 1980. Aside from Harrison, who played guitars and self-produced the sessions,&lt;ref name="Madinger &amp; Easter p 459" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Badman, p. 266.&lt;/ref&gt; the musicians on the track were [[Neil Larsen]] and [[Gary Brooker]] (both on keyboards), [[Willie Weeks]] (bass), [[Jim Keltner]] (drums), [[Ray Cooper]] (percussion) and [[Tom Scott (musician)|Tom Scott]] (horns).&lt;ref name="Leng p 226" /&gt; Harrison added various [[sound effects]] throughout the recording, including the sound of bombs being dropped, a cash register,&lt;ref name="Clayson p 381" /&gt; an army on the march, gunfire, and a street demonstration.&lt;ref name="Inglis p 78"&gt;Inglis, p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of these effects appear midway through the song,&lt;ref name="Clayson p 381" /&gt; accompanied by a [[Moog synthesizer]] solo,&lt;ref name="Leng p 226" /&gt; after which the section concludes with the sound of a [[nuclear explosion]].&lt;ref name="White/Musician" /&gt; A baby's cry then accompanies the song's return.&lt;ref name="White/Musician" /&gt;

At the end of the track, Harrison edited in the faint sound of a bow-played Indian string instrument, the [[tar shehnai]].&lt;ref name="White/Musician" /&gt; This part was taken from "Crying", an instrumental piece performed by Vinayak Vora&lt;ref&gt;Album credits, ''[[Wonderwall Music]]'' CD ([[Apple Records]], 2014; produced by George Harrison).&lt;/ref&gt; and released on Harrison's 1968 soundtrack album ''[[Wonderwall Music]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Rodriguez, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; When asked about its inclusion in "Save the World", Harrison told ''[[Musician (magazine)|Musician]]'' magazine in 1987: "I just wanted to let the whole song go out with something sad, to touch that nerve and maybe make you think, 'Ohhh shit.'"&lt;ref name="White/Musician" /&gt;{{refn|group=nb|Harrison added, with the regard to the tar shehnai: "It's like a one-string fiddle, a bowed instrument with the sympathetic strings resting over a stretched skin, so it has that hollow, echoey resonance, a wailing, crying sound."&lt;ref name="White/Musician"&gt;Timothy White, "George Harrison – Reconsidered", ''[[Musician (magazine)|Musician]]'', November 1987, p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

After submitting ''Somewhere in England'' to [[Warner Bros. Records]], the distributor of his [[Dark Horse Records|Dark Horse]] record label, in late September 1980,&lt;ref&gt;Doggett, p. 267.&lt;/ref&gt; Harrison was forced to rework the content of the album&lt;ref name="Madinger &amp; Easter p 459" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clayson, pp. 377–78.&lt;/ref&gt; – including replacing four of the original songs – to ensure the release had more commercial appeal.&lt;ref&gt;Rodriguez, p. 433.&lt;/ref&gt; Harrison chose to retain "Save the World" in the revised track listing and worked with Ray Cooper on a second version of the album.&lt;ref name="Madinger &amp; Easter p 459" /&gt; Although the mix for the re-submitted "Save the World" differed little from Harrison's original,&lt;ref name="Madinger &amp; Easter p 461"&gt;Madinger &amp; Easter, p. 461.&lt;/ref&gt; Cooper was credited as a co-producer.&lt;ref name="Harry p 349"&gt;Harry, p. 349.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Release and reception==
''Somewhere in England'' was released on 1 June 1981,&lt;ref&gt;Badman, p. 284.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tillery, p. 164.&lt;/ref&gt; with "Save the World" sequenced as the final track.&lt;ref&gt;Harry, pp. 349–50.&lt;/ref&gt; It was the only song from Harrison's initial submission to Warner Bros. to retain its position in the running order of the official release.&lt;ref name="Madinger &amp; Easter p 461" /&gt; The album was a relative commercial success,&lt;ref name="Inglis p 78" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ingham, pp. 129, 136.&lt;/ref&gt; an outcome that was due largely to a public outpouring of grief in reaction to the murder of Harrison's former [[Beatles]] bandmate [[John Lennon]] in December 1980.&lt;ref&gt;Larkin, pp. 2646–47.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leng, pp. 217–18.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Madinger &amp; Easter, pp. 459–60.&lt;/ref&gt; As a follow-up single to Harrison's tribute to Lennon, "[[All Those Years Ago]]", Warner's released "[[Teardrops (George Harrison song)|Teardrops]]",&lt;ref name="Madinger &amp; Easter p 461" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clayson, p. 378.&lt;/ref&gt; which was another of the album's four replacement tracks.&lt;ref&gt;Huntley, p. 179.&lt;/ref&gt; This release took place on 20 July 1981, with "Save the World" appearing as the single's [[B-side]].&lt;ref&gt;Madinger &amp; Easter, p. 633.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his album review for ''[[Creem]]'' magazine, Mitchell Cohen called Harrison a "C– thinker" and ridiculed the lyrics of "Save the World" with the comment: "Harrison comes out against ''paper towels'' (!!) (expect a rebuttal on the next Nancy Walker album) and whalemeat used as dogfood (ditto Lorne Greene)."&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell Cohen, "George Harrison: ''Somewhere In England''", ''[[Creem]]'', September 1981; available at [http://www.rocksbackpages.com/Library/Article/george-harrison-isomewhere-in-englandi Rock's Backpages] (subscription required).&lt;/ref&gt; In another unfavourable review,&lt;ref&gt;Huntley, p. 183.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leng, p. 177.&lt;/ref&gt; Harry Thomas of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' opined that "Social commentary and ironic wit clearly remain outside the scope of Harrison's very real talents" and wrote of "Save the World": "Veering uncertainly between whimsy and dour warnings, the song ultimately fails either to galvanize or amuse."&lt;ref&gt;Harry Thomas, [https://web.archive.org/web/20071124061439/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/georgeharrison/albums/album/176119/review/5946590/somewhere_in_england "George Harrison: Somewhere In England"], ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', 6 August 1981, p. 44 (archived version from 24 November 2007, retrieved 19 November 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, ''[[NME]]'' critic [[Bob Woffinden]] welcomed the song as an example of how the album's subject matter ranged beyond the "humdrum", and he found it "only characteristic of [Harrison] to embrace more universal themes".&lt;ref&gt;Woffinden, p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Greenpeace'' version==
Harrison revisited "Save the World" in 1985 when Greenpeace UK approached him for a contribution to an album intended to raise funds&lt;ref name="Clayson p 388"&gt;Clayson, p. 388.&lt;/ref&gt; for their environmental efforts.&lt;ref name="Madinger &amp; Easter p 461" /&gt; Harrison amended the lyrics slightly to include further references to Greenpeace,&lt;ref name="Madinger &amp; Easter p 461" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Harry p 329"&gt;Harry, p. 329.&lt;/ref&gt; along with a spoken comment that conveyed his disgust with the power of corporations: "You greedy bastards".&lt;ref name="Leng p 226" /&gt; In addition to recording a new vocal, he remixed the musical backing, giving more prominence to some of the guitar parts.&lt;ref name="Huntley p 196"&gt;Huntley, p. 196.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:RainbowWarriorAmsterdam1981.jpg|thumb|right|Greenpeace's ''[[Rainbow Warrior (1955)|Rainbow Warrior]]''. The video clip for "Save the World" used footage of the ship and of Greenpeace's activities to protect the environment.]]
Titled ''[[Greenpeace – The Album]]'',&lt;ref name="Huntley p 196" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Allison, p. 154.&lt;/ref&gt; and including contributions from fifteen other British artists,&lt;ref&gt;Scott Benarde, [http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1985-08-23/features/8502040412_1_rainbow-warrior-compilation-album-fernando-pereira "Brits Cut An Album To Aid Greenpeace"], ''[[Sun-Sentinel]]'', 23 August 1985 (retrieved 20 November 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; the album was released in the UK by [[EMI]] on 4 June 1985.&lt;ref&gt;Badman, p. 355.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Madinger &amp; Easter, p. 636.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=nb|The album was issued by [[A&amp;M Records]] in the United States, in August 1985.&lt;ref&gt;The Editors of ''Rolling Stone'', p. 190.&lt;/ref&gt;}} The inclusion of "Save the World" on ''Greenpeace'' marked a rare new musical release for Harrison between 1983 and 1986,&lt;ref&gt;Dave Thompson, "The Music of George Harrison: An album-by-album guide", ''[[Goldmine (magazine)|Goldmine]]'', 25 January 2002, p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Editors of ''Rolling Stone'', pp. 189–90.&lt;/ref&gt; when he was otherwise engaged in film production with the continued success of HandMade.&lt;ref&gt;Leng, pp. 239–43.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Inglis, pp. 84–86.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Larkin, p. 2647.&lt;/ref&gt; Over the same period, however, he became increasingly involved in environmental matters; these activities included attending an anti-nuclear demonstration in London's [[Trafalgar Square]],&lt;ref&gt;Badman, p. 373.&lt;/ref&gt; voicing support for the British [[Green Party of England and Wales|Green Party]], and inspiring a successful campaign to stop the [[John Lewis Partnership]] from demolishing Henley's Regal Cinema and building a supermarket complex.&lt;ref&gt;Clayson, pp. 388–90.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harry, p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt;

The song was also included in the video compilation ''Greenpeace: Non-Toxic Video Hits'', released in December 1985,&lt;ref&gt;Badman, p. 362.&lt;/ref&gt; five months after the French intelligence services' [[Sinking of the Rainbow Warrior|sinking]] of the Greenpeace flagship ''[[Rainbow Warrior (1955)|Rainbow Warrior]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Brown &amp; Rob Evans, [https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2005/aug/23/uk.freedomofinformation "How Rainbow Warrior was played down"], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 23 August 2005 (retrieved 20 November 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; Produced by Ian Weiner, the clip for "Save the World" consisted of scenes of ''Rainbow Warrior'' and Greenpeace personnel at work on their international activist campaigns.&lt;ref name="Madinger &amp; Easter p 461" /&gt;

==Retrospective assessment and legacy==
Until his death in November 2001, Harrison continued to express alarm at the ecological issues facing the world.&lt;ref&gt;Tillery, p. 147.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Allison, pp. 70, 74–75.&lt;/ref&gt; He dedicated his 1989 compilation album ''[[Best of Dark Horse 1976–1989|Best of Dark Horse]]'' to Greenpeace, Friends of the Earth and "anyone interested in saving our planet";&lt;ref&gt;Harry, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; in the revised artwork for the 2001 reissue of ''[[All Things Must Pass]]'', he included a series of images showing the gradual encroachment of pollution and industry onto the Friar Park scene depicted on that album's 1970 cover photo.&lt;ref&gt;Huntley, p. 305.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tillery, pp. 146–47.&lt;/ref&gt; As a songwriter, he revisited the themes of "Save the World" in "[[Cockamamie Business]]", a new song issued on ''Best of Dark Horse'',&lt;ref&gt;Allison, pp. 70, 139.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Madinger &amp; Easter, pp. 477–78.&lt;/ref&gt; and in the title track to his final studio album, the posthumously released ''[[Brainwashed (George Harrison album)|Brainwashed]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Inglis, pp. 100, 141.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=nb|In addition, Harrison considered titling that album ''Your Planet Is Doomed – Volume One''.&lt;ref&gt;Huntley, pp. 309–10.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Allison p 70"&gt;Allison, p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the 1990s, Harrison's elder sister, Louise, used "Save the World" as the soundtrack for a series of public service radio segments she produced, titled ''Good Earthkeeping Tips'', which offered information on environmental issues.&lt;ref&gt;Clayson, p. 462.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harry, p. 222.&lt;/ref&gt; In keeping with Harrison's instructions for the reissuing of his [[The Dark Horse Years 1976–1992|Dark Horse catalogue]],&lt;ref&gt;Leng, pp. 312–13.&lt;/ref&gt; a [[Demo (music)|demo]] of the song appeared as the sole bonus track on the 2004 reissue of ''Somewhere in England''.&lt;ref name="John Metzger/MB"&gt;John Metzger, [http://www.musicbox-online.com/gh-some.html#axzz3AMts81es "George Harrison ''The Dark Horse Years'' (Part Three: ''Somewhere in England'')"], ''The Music Box'', vol. 11 (5), May 2004 (retrieved 20 November 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; Writing for ''[[Uncut (magazine)|Uncut]]'' in March 2017, [[Neil Spencer]] highlighted "Save the World" as one of the "[unexpected] delights" among Harrison's 1980s releases, and said that while it was dismissed as "soft protest" originally, the song is "beautifully played and never more relevant than today".&lt;ref name="Spencer/Uncut"&gt;Neil Spencer, [http://www.uncut.co.uk/reviews/album/george-harrison-vinyl-collection "George Harrison – The Vinyl Collection"], [[Uncut (magazine)|uncut.co.uk]], 27 March 2017 (retrieved 30 November 2017).&lt;/ref&gt;

"Save the World" is held in low regard by several Harrison and Beatles biographers. Chip Madinger and Mark Easter describe it as "a wholly unappealing track" on which the "heavyhandedness" of the lyrics is completely at odds with the musical mood.&lt;ref name="Madinger &amp; Easter p 461" /&gt; Ian Inglis echoes this view, deeming the lyrics "trite to the point of being risible" and the combination of an unfocused narrative and the overuse of sound effects to be as unsuccessful as the Beatles' work during the ''[[Magical Mystery Tour]]'' era.&lt;ref&gt;Inglis, pp. 77–78.&lt;/ref&gt; Although he concedes that the scarcity of environmental songs in the early 1980s, relative to the 1990s, might be a mitigating factor, Inglis dismisses the song as a "hopelessly vague indictment of the perils we are inflicting around the globe", adding: "The problem with such a general attack is that it lacks focus and, therefore, force."&lt;ref name="Inglis p 78" /&gt;

Alan Clayson views Harrison's conservationist sentiments as "laudable" and considers the track to be a protest song in the mould of [[Barry McGuire]]'s 1965 hit "[[Eve of Destruction (song)|Eve of Destruction]]", yet he also identifies the lack of subtlety as betraying "the impartiality of one long and, perhaps, guiltily isolated from the everyday".&lt;ref name="Clayson p 381" /&gt; [[Dale Allison]] recognises it as "the most extensive expression of George's ecological anxiety" and a sincere statement, particularly as Harrison chose to revisit the track for the Greenpeace album.&lt;ref&gt;Allison, pp. 70–71, 154.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Allison deems it to be a "strange song" with a "jarring disjunction between lyric and sound", and he says that as with Harrison's other songs about pollution and environmental issues, his message reflects a romanticism that was born out of 1960s radicalism but fails to convince in the manner of [[Neil Young]]'s "[[After the Gold Rush (song)|After the Gold Rush]]".&lt;ref&gt;Allison, pp. 70–71, 75.&lt;/ref&gt; Simon Leng finds "Save the World" closer in style to Monty Python's "[[Eric the Half-a-Bee]]" than to a genuine environmental song such as "[[Mercy Mercy Me (The Ecology)]]" by [[Marvin Gaye]].&lt;ref name="Leng p 226" /&gt; He describes the ''Somewhere in England'' version as "horribly overproduced" next to the "charming" demo, which "is more [[Bob Dylan|Dylan]] than Monty Python".&lt;ref&gt;Leng, p. 312.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{expand Ukrainian|Шістдесятники|date=June 2012}}

The '''Sixtiers''' ([[Russian Language|Russian]]: Шестидесятники) were representatives of а new generation of the Soviet [[Intelligentsia]], most of whom were born between 1925 and 1945, and entered the culture and politics of the USSR during the late 1950s and 1960s — after the [[Khrushchev Thaw]].  Their worldviews were formed by years of [[Great Purge|Stalin's repressions and purges]], which affected many of the Sixtiers' immediate families; and [[World War II]], where many of them had volunteered to fight.

Sixtiers were distinguished by their liberal and anti-totalitarian views, and romanticism that found vivid expressions in music and visual arts.  Although most of the Sixtiers believed in [[Communist]] ideals, they had come to be strongly disappointed with Stalin's regime and its repression of basic civil liberties.

Many of the Sixtiers were intellectuals of roughly two strains: the "physicists" (those involved in the technical sciences) and the "lyricists" (writers, theater and film professionals, and otherwise liberal arts representatives).  [[Bard (Soviet Union)|Bard]] (singer-songwriter) culture, poetry, disillusionment in politics, and love for camping trips to the farther regions of the Soviet Union were some of the common attributes and pastimes of the Sixtiers.

The Sixtiers had some parallels to the [[New Left]] and [[hippie]] movements in the West but had more in common with the more intellectual-oriented [[Beat Generation]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1798">The '''[http://sath.org Society for Accessible Travel &amp; Hospitality]''', or SATH, is a [[New York City|New York]] based [[non-profit organization]] founded in 1976 and dedicated to the promotion of [[accessibility]] in the travel &amp; tourism industries. SATH's mission is "to raise awareness of the needs of all travelers with disabilities, remove physical and attitudinal barriers to free access and expand travel opportunities in the United States and abroad."

'''''Super Mario Bros.'''''{{efn|{{nihongo|スーパーマリオブラザーズ|Sūpā Mario Burazāzu}} in Japanese}} is a [[platform game|platform]] [[video game]] developed and published by [[Nintendo]]. The successor to the 1983 arcade game, ''[[Mario Bros.]]'', it was released in Japan in 1985 for the [[Famicom]], and in North America and Europe for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] (NES) in 1985 and 1987 respectively. Players control [[Mario]], or his brother [[Luigi]] in the multiplayer mode, as they travel the Mushroom Kingdom to rescue [[Princess Toadstool]] from the antagonist, [[Bowser (character)|Bowser]]. They must traverse [[side-scrolling video game|side-scrolling]] stages while avoiding hazards such as enemies and pits with the aid of [[power-up]]s such as the Super Mushroom, Fire Flower and Starman.

The game was designed by [[Shigeru Miyamoto]] and [[Takashi Tezuka]] and was initially planned as a farewell salute to cartridge games on the Famicom, in anticipation of the forthcoming release of the [[Famicom Disk System]], drawing technical influence from several of the console's previous games. It was designed with ease of access in mind, with the first level, [[World 1-1]], designed to introduce the core mechanics. The music was composed by [[Koji Kondo]], and is considered influential in making music a larger aspect of video games.

''Super Mario Bros.'' is frequently cited as one of the [[greatest video games of all time]], with praise going towards its precise controls. It has sold over 40 million physical copies, also making it one of the [[bestselling games of all time]]. It is credited alongside the NES as one of the key factors in reviving the video game industry after the [[Video game crash of 1983|1983 crash]], and helped popularize side-scrolling platform games. It began an [[Mario (franchise)|expansive franchise]] including a long-running [[Super Mario (series)|game series]], an [[The Super Mario Bros. Super Show!|animated television series]], and a [[Super Mario Bros. (film)|feature film]]. Ports and remakes of the game have been released for most of Nintendo's future systems. Alongside Mario himself, ''Super Mario Bros.'' has become a prominent aspect of [[popular culture]].

== Gameplay ==
[[File:NES Super Mario Bros.png|thumb||''Super Mario Bros.'' features various unique power-ups which assist Mario—in the above picture Mario yields a [[Fire Flower]], allowing him to attack enemies with fire projectiles. Behind Mario is an [[starman (Mario)|invincibility star]], which allows him to withstand touching enemies and other hazards for a short period of time.]]

In ''Super Mario Bros.'', the player takes on the role of [[Mario]], the protagonist of [[Mario (franchise)|the series]]. Mario's younger brother, [[Luigi]], is  controlled by the second player in the game's [[Multiplayer video game|multiplayer]] mode and assumes the same plot role and functionality as Mario. The objective is to race through the Mushroom Kingdom, survive the main antagonist Bowser's forces, and save Princess Toadstool.&lt;ref name="Super Mario Bros. instruction booklet" /&gt;{{rp|7}} The game is a [[side-scrolling video game|side-scrolling]] [[platform game|platformer]]; the player moves from the left side of the screen to the right side in order to reach the flag pole at the end of each level.

The game world features coins scattered around for Mario to collect and special bricks marked with a question mark (''?''), which when hit from below by Mario may reveal more coins or a special item. Other "secret", often invisible, bricks may contain more coins or rare items. If the player gains a Super Mushroom, Mario grows to double his size and gains the ability to break bricks above him. If Mario gets hit in this mode, then instead of dying he turns back to regular Mario.&lt;ref name="Super Mario Bros. instruction booklet" /&gt;{{rp|12}} Players start with a certain number of [[life (gaming)|lives]] and may gain [[Extra life|additional lives]] by picking up green spotted orange 1-Up mushrooms hidden in bricks, or by collecting 100 coins, defeating several enemies in a row with a Koopa shell, or bouncing on enemies successively without touching the ground. Mario loses a life if he takes damage while small, falls in a bottomless pit, or [[Time limit (video gaming)|runs out of time]]. The game ends when all lives are lost, although a button input can be used on the game over screen to continue from the first level of the world in which the player died.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.polygon.com/2015/1/26/7908265/super-mario-bros-continue-cheat-code |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2018-02-22 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180222225911/https://www.polygon.com/2015/1/26/7908265/super-mario-bros-continue-cheat-code |archivedate=February 22, 2018 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mario's primary attack is jumping on top of enemies, though many enemies have differing responses to this. For example, a [[Goomba]] will flatten and be defeated,&lt;ref name="Super Mario Bros. instruction booklet" /&gt;{{rp|12}} while a [[Koopa Troopa]] will temporarily retract into its shell, allowing Mario to use it as a projectile.&lt;ref name="Super Mario Bros. instruction booklet" /&gt;{{rp|11}} These shells may be deflected off a wall to destroy other enemies, though they can also bounce back against Mario, which will hurt or kill him.&lt;ref name="Super Mario Bros. instruction booklet" /&gt;{{rp|19}} Other enemies, such as underwater foes and enemies with spiked tops, cannot be jumped on and damage the player instead.  Mario can also defeat enemies above him by jumping to hit the brick that the enemy is standing on. Mario may also acquire the Fire Flower from certain ? blocks that when picked up changes the color of Super Mario's outfit and allows him to throw fireballs. A less common item is the Starman, which often appears when Mario hits certain concealed or otherwise invisible blocks. This item makes Mario temporarily invincible to most hazards and capable of defeating enemies on contact.&lt;ref name="Super Mario Bros. instruction booklet" /&gt;{{rp|10}}

The game consists of eight worlds with four sub-levels called "stages" in each world."&lt;ref name="IGN VC"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2007/03/06/super-mario-bros-vc-review |title=Super Mario Bros. VC review |first=Mark |last=Birnbaum |date=March 6, 2007 |website=[[IGN]] |accessdate=February 5, 2018 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170924015051/http://www.ign.com/articles/2007/03/06/super-mario-bros-vc-review |archivedate=September 24, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Super Mario Bros. instruction booklet" /&gt;{{rp|7}} The final stage of each world takes place in a castle where Bowser is fought above a suspension bridge; the first seven of these Bowsers are "false Bowsers" whom are actually minions disguised as him, whilst the real Bowser is found in the 8th world. Bowser and his decoys are defeated by jumping over them and reaching the axe on the end of the bridge, although they can also be defeated using a Fire Flower. The game also includes some stages taking place underwater, which contain different enemies. In addition, there are bonuses and secret areas in the game. Most secret areas contain more coins for Mario to collect, but some contain "warp pipes" that allow Mario to advance directly to later worlds in the game without completing the intervening stages. After completing the game once, the player is rewarded with the ability to replay the game with changes made to increase its difficulty, such as all Goombas in the game being replaced with Buzzy Beetles, enemies similar to Koopa Troopas who cannot be defeated using the Fire Flower.&lt;ref name="allgame"&gt;{{cite web |last=Smith |first=Geoffrey Douglas |title=Super Mario Bros – Review |website=[[Allgame]] |accessdate=December 6, 2012 |url=http://allgame.com/game.php?id=1320&amp;tab=review |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141114120755/http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=1320&amp;tab=review |archivedate=November 14, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Plot and setting===
In the fantasy setting of the [[Mushroom Kingdom]], a tribe of turtle-like creatures known as the [[Koopa Troopa]]s invade the kingdom and uses the magic of its king, [[Bowser (character)|Bowser]], to turn its inhabitants, known as the Mushroom People, into inanimate objects such as bricks, stones and horsehair plants. Bowser and his army also kidnap [[Princess Peach|Princess Toadstool]], the princess of the Mushroom Kingdom and the only one with the ability to reverse Bowser's spell. After hearing the news, [[Mario]] sets out to save the princess and free the kingdom from Bowser.&lt;ref name="Super Mario Bros. instruction booklet"&gt;{{cite book |title=Super Mario Bros.

== Development ==
''Super Mario Bros.'', the successor to the 1983 [[Arcade game|arcade title]] ''[[Mario Bros.]]'', was designed by [[Shigeru Miyamoto]] and [[Takashi Tezuka]], both of whom belonged to [[Nintendo]]'s Creative Department, and largely programmed by Toshihiki Nakago of SRD Company, Ltd.&lt;ref name="iwataasks25_1"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://us.wii.com/iwata_asks/mario25th/vol5_page1.jsp |title= Using the D-pad to Jump |work= Iwata Asks: Super Mario Bros. 25th Anniversary Vol. 5: Original Super Mario Developers |publisher= [[Nintendo of America]] |date= February 1, 2011 |accessdate= February 1, 2011 |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110203071512/http://us.wii.com/iwata_asks/mario25th/vol5_page1.jsp |archivedate= February 3, 2011 |df= mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Though not originally using any particular character, the very deliberate creative process of what would become their next game was motivated by their technical knowledge from previous games such as ''[[Excitebike]]'', ''[[Devil World]]'' and ''[[Kung-Fu Master (video game)|Kung Fu]]'', by a desire to give the [[ROM cartridge]] format "a final exclamation point" in light of the forthcoming [[Family Computer Disk System|Famicom Disk System]] which was expected to become the dominant new game delivery medium, and by continuing their legacy of "athletic games" with a character running and jumping with many obstacles. Miyamoto explained, "We felt strongly about how we were the first to come up with that genre, and it was a goal of ours to keep pushing it."&lt;ref name="Miyamoto Reveals All"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NES Classic"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nintendo.com/nes-classic/super-mario-bros-and-super-mario-bros-3-developer-interview |title=Super Mario Bros. and Super Mario Bros. 3 developer interviews- NES Classic Edition |publisher=[[Nintendo of America]] |accessdate=November 18, 2017 |website=Nintendo.com |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201032653/https://www.nintendo.com/nes-classic/super-mario-bros-and-super-mario-bros-3-developer-interview |archivedate=December 1, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The game was made in tandem with ''[[The Legend of Zelda]]'', another Famicom game directed and designed by Miyamoto, which released in Japan five months after ''Super Mario Bros.'' As a result, certain elements were carried over from ''The Legend of Zelda'' to ''Super Mario Bros''; for instance, the fire bars that appear in the game’s castle levels began as an unused object from ''Zelda''.&lt;ref name=fascfacts&gt;{{cite web|url=https://uproxx.com/viral/20-fascinating-facts-you-may-not-know-about-super-mario-bros/amp/ |title=20 Fascinating Facts You Might Not Know about ‘Super Mario Bros.’ |first=Nathan |last=Birch |date=April 24, 2014 |publisher=[[Uproxx]] |accessdate=March 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Development was aimed at simplicity in order to have a new game available for the end-of-year shopping season.&lt;ref name=simple&gt;{{cite web |title= Keeping It Simple |url= https://www.nintendo.co.uk/NOE/en_GB/news/iwata/super_mario_bros_25th_anniversary_19226_19227.html |archive-url= https://archive.is/20120629011724/http://www.nintendo.co.uk/NOE/en_GB/news/iwata/super_mario_bros_25th_anniversary_19226_19227.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date= June 29, 2012 |work= Iwata Asks: Super Mario Bros. 25th Anniversary |publisher= Nintendo |accessdate= October 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The developers started by putting together a prototype in which the player simply moved a 16 by 32 pixel square around a single screen. Tezuka suggested the use of Mario after seeing the sales figures of ''[[Mario Bros.]]'', which was still selling well throughout the previous year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://us.wii.com/iwata_asks/nsmb/vol2_page2.jsp |title=Iwata Asks: New Super Mario Bros (Volume 2- It Started With a Square Object Moving) |author=Satoru Iwata |date=2009 |accessdate=October 25, 2017 |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091215062341/http://us.wii.com/iwata_asks/nsmb/vol2_page3.jsp |archive-date=December 15, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The team chose to name the game "''Super Mario Bros.''" after deciding to implement the Super Mushroom into the game.&lt;ref name="NES Classic"/&gt; The game initially made use of a concept in which Mario or Luigi could enter a rocket ship and drive it around while firing at enemies, but this went unused;&lt;ref name="Mario original control scheme"&gt;{{cite web |last=Gantayat |first=Anoop |title=Super Mario Bros.

However, when Tezuka saw Miyamoto’s design for the character, he noted that it looked more akin to that of a [[turtle]], prompting the two to work on defining and fleshing out the character’s design until coming up with his final appearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Iwata Asks Volume 8- Flipnote Studios-An Animation Class 4.My First Project: Draw a Rug |url=https://www.nintendo.co.uk/NOE/en_GB/systems/volume_8_14207.html#top |publisher=[[Nintendo of Europe]] |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120525101151/http://www.nintendo.co.uk/NOE/en_GB/systems/volume_8_14207.html#top |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-05-25 |df= }}2009-08-11&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of ''Super Mario Bros.'' is an early example of [[Division of labor|specialization]] in the video game industry, made possible and necessary by the capabilities of the Famicom. Miyamoto designed the game world and led a team of seven programmers and artists who turned his ideas into code, sprites, music and sound effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |first=Casey |last=O'Donnell |title=This Is Not A Software Industry |encyclopedia=The Video Game Industry: Formation, Present State, and Future |editor-first1=Peter |editor-last1=Zackariasson |editor-first2=Timothy L. |editor-last2=Wilson |publisher=Routledge |year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The team based the level design around a small Mario, intending to later make his size bigger in the final version. Then they decided it would be fun to let Mario change his size via a [[power-up]]. The early level design was focused on teaching players that mushrooms were distinct from Goombas and would be beneficial to them, so in [[World 1-1|the first level of the game]], the first mushroom is difficult to avoid if it is released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Letting Everyone Know It Was A Good Mushroom |url=http://iwataasks.nintendo.com/interviews/#/wii/nsmb/0/3 |work=Iwata Asks: New Super Mario Bros Wii |publisher=Nintendo |accessdate=December 5, 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160927194716/http://iwataasks.nintendo.com/interviews/#/wii/nsmb/0/3 |archivedate=September 27, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of mushrooms to change size was influenced by common Japanese folktales in which people wander into forests and eat magical mushrooms; this also resulted in the game world being named the "Mushroom Kingdom". The team also deliberately chose not to have Mario begin levels as Super Mario in order to make obtaining a mushroom more gratifying for the player.&lt;ref name="NES Classic"/&gt; Miyamoto explained: "When we made the prototype of the big Mario, we did not feel he was big enough. So, we came up with the idea of showing the smaller Mario first, who could be made bigger later in the game; then players could see and feel that he was bigger."&lt;ref name="Miyamoto Speaks!"&gt;{{cite book |last1=DeMaria |first1=Rusel |last2=Wilson |first2=Johnny L. |title=High Score!: The Illustrated History of Electronic Games |year=2004 |publisher=McGraw-Hill/Osborne |location=Emeryville, California |isbn=0-07-223172-6 |pp=238–240}}&lt;/ref&gt; A rumor stemming from a Japanese magazine claimed that the developers came up with the idea to include a small Mario after a bug in the game caused only the upper-half of his body to appear, but this claim has been disavowed by Miyamoto.&lt;ref name="NES Classic"/&gt; Miyamoto said the shell-kicking 1-up trick was intentionally designed and carefully tested, but "people turned out to be a lot better at pulling the trick off for ages on end than we thought".&lt;ref name="Miyamoto Reveals All"&gt;{{cite web |last=Gifford |first=Kevin |title=Super Mario Bros.' 25th: Miyamoto Reveals All |url=http://www.ugo.com/games/super-mario-bros-25th-miyamoto-reveals-all.html |website=[[1UP.com]] |accessdate=October 24, 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150105015455/http://www.ugo.com/games/super-mario-bros-25th-miyamoto-reveals-all.html |archivedate=January 5, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other features, such as blocks containing multiple coins, were inspired by programming glitches.&lt;ref name="Miyamoto Speaks!"/&gt;

''Super Mario Bros.'' was developed via a 256-kilobit cartridge.&lt;ref name=Culmination&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nintendo.co.uk/Iwata-Asks/Super-Mario-Bros-25th-Anniversary/Vol-5-Original-Super-Mario-Developers/3-The-Grand-Culmination/3-The-Grand-Culmination-212856.html |title=Iwata Asks- Super Mario Bros. 25th Anniversary (3. The Grand Culmination) |publisher=[[Nintendo of America]] |accessdate=March 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to technical limitations at the time, several tactics were used to save cartridge space. For instance, clouds and bushes in the game’s backgrounds use that same sprite recolored.&lt;ref name=fascfacts/&gt; Sound effects were also recycled; the sound that plays when Mario is damaged is recycled and used as the sound effect for when he enters a pipe, as applies similarly to Mario jumping on an enemy and swimming in an underwater level.&lt;ref name=simple/&gt; After completing the game, the development team decided that they should introduce players with a simple, easy-to-defeat enemy rather than beginning the game with Koopa Troopas. By this point, the game had nearly run out of memory, so the designers created the Goombas by making a single static image and flipping it back and forth to save space while creating a convincing character animation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://iwataasks.nintendo.com/interviews/#/wii/nsmb/1/5 |title=Iwata Asks- New Super Mario Bros.

Miyamoto used this remaining space to add a sprite of a [[Crown (headgear)|crown]] into the game, which would appear in the player’s life counter if they managed to obtain at least 10 lives.&lt;ref name=Culmination/&gt;

{{main|World 1-1}}

During the [[third generation of video game consoles]], tutorials which explained the mechanics of the game were rare.  Instead, players learned how a video game worked through being guided by [[level design]]. The opening section of ''Super Mario Bros.'' was therefore specifically designed in such a way that players would be forced to explore the mechanics of the game in order to be able to advance. Rather than confront the newly oriented player with obstacles, the first level of ''Super Mario Bros.'' lays down the variety of in-game hazards by means of repetition, iteration, and escalation.&lt;ref name=1UP&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.1up.com/features/learning-level-design-mario |website=[[1UP.com]] |title=Learning Through Level Design with Mario |last=Parish |first=Jeremy |year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with ''[[Eurogamer]]'', Miyamoto explained that he created "World 1-1" to contain everything a player needs to "gradually and naturally understand what they're doing",  so that they can quickly understand how the game works. According to Miyamoto, once the player understands the mechanics of the game, the player will be able to play more freely and it becomes "their game."&lt;ref name=Eurogamer&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2015-09-07-video-miyamoto-on-how-nintendo-made-marios-most-iconic-level |website=[[Eurogamer]] |title=Video: Miyamoto on how Nintendo made Mario's most iconic level |last=Robinson |first=Martin |date=September 7, 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160321111454/http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2015-09-07-video-miyamoto-on-how-nintendo-made-marios-most-iconic-level |archivedate=March 21, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gamasutra&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/253150/How_Miyamoto_built_Super_Mario_Bros_legendary_World_11.php |website=[[Gamasutra]] |title=How Miyamoto built ''Super Mario Bros.''{{'}} legendary World 1-1 |last=Kerr |first=Chris |date=September 8, 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305081905/http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/253150/How_Miyamoto_built_Super_Mario_Bros_legendary_World_11.php |archivedate=March 5, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Minus World ===
The "'''Minus World'''" (also referred to as "World Negative One") is the name given to an unbeatable [[glitch]] level present in the original release of ''Super Mario Bros.'' World 1-2 contains a hidden [[warp zone]], with warp pipes that transport the player to worlds 2, 3, and 4, accessed by running over a wall near the exit. If the player is able to exploit a bug that allows Mario to pass through bricks, the player can enter the warp zone by passing through the wall and the pipe to World 2-1 and 4-1 may instead transport the player to a stage labeled "World -1". This stage's map is identical to worlds 2-2 and 7-2, and upon entering the warp pipe at the end, the player is taken back to the start of the level, thus trapping the player in the level until all lives have been lost. Although the level name is shown as "&amp;nbsp;-1" with a leading space on the [[HUD (video gaming)|heads-up display]], it is actually World 36-1, with the tile for 36 being shown as a blank space.&lt;ref name=world36&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.transformationsjournal.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Ashton-Newman_Trans20.pdf |title=Slow Play Strategies: Digital Games Walkthroughs and the Perpetual Upgrade Economy |first1=Daniel |last1=Ashton |first2=James |last2=Newman |website= |publisher=Transformations Journal |date=2011 |accessdate=March 14, 2018 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180315134405/http://www.transformationsjournal.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Ashton-Newman_Trans20.pdf |archivedate=March 15, 2018 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Minus World bug in the Japanese Famicom Disk System version of the game behaves differently and creates multiple, completable stages. "World -1" is an underwater version of World 1-3 with an underwater level [[Palette (computing)|color palette]] and underwater level music, and contains [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprites]] of Princess Toadstool, Bowser, and Hammer Bros. "World -2" is an identical copy of World 7-3, and "World -3" is a copy of World 4-4 with an underground level colour palette and underground level music, and does not loop if the player takes the wrong path, contrary to the original World 4-4. After completing the level, [[Toad (Nintendo)|Toad]]'s usual message is displayed, but [[Toad (Nintendo)|Toad]] himself is absent. After completing these levels, the player returns to the [[Title screen (gaming)|title screen]] as if the game were completed, and can now replay the game in "Hard Mode."&lt;ref name=altMW&gt;{{cite web |url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/09/30-years-30-memorable-facts-about-super-mario-bros/ |title=30 years, 30 memorable facts about Super Mario Bros. |access-date=September 15, 2015 |author=Kyle Orland |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150914233725/http://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/09/30-years-30-memorable-facts-about-super-mario-bros/ |archivedate=September 14, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=kotaku1&gt;{{cite web |url=http://kotaku.com/gaming/super-mario-bros/japanese-famicom-smb-minus-world-203229.php |title=Japanese Famicom SMB Minus World |accessdate=August 27, 2008 |work=Kotaku |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130104055353/http://kotaku.com/203229/japanese-famicom-smb-minus-world?tag=gamingsupermariobros |archivedate=January 4, 2013 |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are actually hundreds of glitch levels beyond the Minus World (256 worlds are present including the 8 playable ones), which can be accessed in a multitude of ways, such as [[Cheating in video games|cheat codes]] or [[ROM hacking]].&lt;ref name=256mWs&gt;{{cite web |url=http://legendsoflocalization.com/super-mario-bros/misc/#the-secret-minus-world |title=The Secret Minus World |website=Legends of Localization |accessdate=March 14, 2018 |quote=American gamers eager for more Mario stuff went bonkers when the above trick got out.

=== Music ===
{{See also|Super Mario Bros. theme}}
Nintendo sound designer [[Koji Kondo]] wrote the six-song musical score for ''Super Mario Bros.'', as well as designing all of the game's sound effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2007/03/72971 |title=Behind the Mario Maestro's Music |accessdate=June 26, 2010 |work=Wired News |date=March 15, 2007 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5wSqL8j29?url=http://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2007/03/72971 |archivedate=February 13, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time he was composing, video game music was mostly meant to attract attention, not necessarily to enhance or conform to the game. Kondo's work on ''Super Mario Bros.'' was one of the major forces in the shift towards music becoming an integral and participatory part of video games.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Koji Kondo's Super Mario Bros. Soundtrack |last=Schartmann |first=Andrew |publisher=Bloomsbury |year=2015 |isbn=978-1-62892-853-2 |location=New York |pages=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kondo had two specific goals for his music: "to convey an unambiguous sonic image of the game world", and "to enhance the emotional and physical experience of the gamer".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The music of ''Super Mario Bros.'' is coordinated with the onscreen animations of the various sprites, which was one way which Kondo created a sense of greater immersion. Kondo wasn't the first to do this in a video game; for instance, ''[[Space Invaders]]'' features a simple song that gets faster and faster as the aliens speed up, eliciting a sense of stress and impending doom which matches the increasing challenge of the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Koji Kondo's Super Mario Bros. Soundtrack |last=Schartmann |first=Andrew |publisher=Bloomsbury |year=2015 |isbn=978-1-62892-853-2 |location=New York |pages=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Kondo attempted to take the idea further, stating that the primary question determining the use of a game's music was "Do the game and music fit one another?"&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite thesis |last=Laroche |first=G. |date=2012 |title=Analyzing musical Mario-media: Variations in the music of Super Mario video games |publisher=McGill University Libraries |via=ProQuest Dissertations &amp; Theses A&amp;I; ProQuest Dissertations &amp; Theses Global.

Kondo's compositions were largely influenced by the game's gameplay, intending for it to "heighten the feeling of how the game controls".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Koji Kondo's Super Mario Bros. Soundtrack |last=Schartmann |first=Andrew |publisher=Bloomsbury |year=2015 |isbn=978-1-62892-853-2 |location=New York |pages=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before composition began, a prototype of the game was presented to Kondo so that he could get an idea of Mario's general environment and revolve the music around it. Kondo wrote the score with the help of a small [[piano]] to create appropriate melodies to fit the game's environments. After the development of the game showed progress, Kondo began to feel that his music did not quite fit the pace of the game, so he changed it a bit by increasing the songs' [[tempo]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.1up.com/do/feature?cId=3163588 |title=Super Mario Bros.

== Release ==
''Super Mario Bros.'' was first released in Japan on September 13, 1985, for the [[Famicom]].

The game's concrete North American release date is unknown and is frequently debated; despite generally being cited as having been released alongside the NES in October 1985 as a [[launch title]], several other sources conflict with this statement, suggesting that the game may have released in other varying time frames ranging from November 1985 to early 1986.&lt;ref name="Sad But"/&gt;

=== Alternate versions ===
As one of Nintendo's most popular games, ''Super Mario Bros.'' has been re-released and remade numerous times, with every single major Nintendo console up to the [[Wii U]] sporting its own port or remake of the game with the exception of the [[Nintendo 64]].&lt;ref name="30 years"/&gt;

==== Ports ====
''Super Mario Bros.'' has been ported several times since its release. A version of the game titled '''''Super Mario Bros. Special''''' developed by [[Hudson Soft]] was released in Japan in 1986 for the [[NEC PC-8801]] and [[Sharp X1]] personal computers. Despite featuring similar controls and graphics, the game has different level designs and new items, as well as brand new enemies based on enemies from ''[[Mario Bros. (video game)|Mario Bros.]]'' and ''[[Donkey Kong (video game)|Donkey Kong]]''.&lt;ref name="30 years"/&gt; A handheld LCD game under the same name was released as a part of Nintendo's [[Game &amp; Watch]] line of LCD games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.museumofplay.org/online-collections/22/44/107.1265 |title=107.1265: Super Mario Bros.

'''''Vs. Super Mario Bros.''''' is an arcade adaptation of the original version of ''Super Mario Bros'', released through Nintendo's [[Nintendo VS. System|NES-based arcade cabinet]], the Nintendo Vs. Unisystem (and its variant, Nintendo Vs. Dualsystem). Several of the game's levels are changed, containing narrower platforms, more dangerous enemies, and omitting several hidden secrets such as 1-ups, making the game more difficult than the original ''Super Mario Bros.''

The game also features the ability for a player to save their progress midway through the game and changes the game's multiplayer mode so that the two players switch off after every level in addition to whenever a player dies. ''Super Mario All-Stars'' was also rereleased for the Wii as a re-packaged, 25th anniversary version, featuring the same version of the game, along with a 32-page art book and a compilation CD of music from various ''Super Mario'' games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2010/10/nintendo-bringing-classic-mario-games-to-the-wii-for-30/ |title=Nintendo bringing classic Mario games to the Wii for $30 |first=Ben |last=Kuchera |date=October 28, 2010 |website=[[Ars Technica]] |accessdate=March 1, 2018 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180302044745/https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2010/10/nintendo-bringing-classic-mario-games-to-the-wii-for-30/ |archivedate=March 2, 2018 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on the original ''Super Mario Bros.'', it features an [[overworld]] level map, simultaneous multiplayer, a Challenge mode in which the player finds hidden objects and achieves a certain score in addition to normally completing the level, and eight additional worlds based on the main worlds of the Japanese 1986 game ''[[Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels|Super Mario Bros. 2]]''. It is compatible with the [[Game Boy Printer]]. Compared to ''Super Mario Bros.'', the game features a few minor visual upgrades such as water and lava now being animated rather than static, and a smaller screen due to the lower resolution of the Game Boy Color.

==== Re-releases ====
In early 2003, ''Super Mario Bros.'' was ported to the Game Boy Advance as a part of the Famicom Minis collection in Japan and as a part of the NES Series in the US. This version of the game is entirely emulated, making it completely identical to the original game. According to the NPD Group (which tracks game sales in North America), this re-released version of ''Super Mario Bros.'' was the best-selling Game Boy Advance game from June 2004 to December 2004.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gamespot.com/gba/action/famicomminisupermariobros/news.html?sid=6103856 |title=ChartSpot: June 2004 |accessdate=August 27, 2008 |last=Thorsen |first=Tor |date=November 21, 2005 |publisher=GameSpot |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929225604/http://www.gamespot.com/gba/action/famicomminisupermariobros/news.html?sid=6103856 |archivedate=September 29, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, Nintendo re-released this port of the game as a part of the game's 20th Anniversary; this special edition of the game went on to sell approximately 876,000 units.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

The game is one of the 19 unlockable NES games included in the [[GameCube]] game ''[[Animal Crossing (video game)|Animal Crossing]]'', for which it was distributed by [[Famitsu]] as a prize for owners of Dobutsu no Mori+; outside of this, the game can't be unlocked through in-game conventional means, and the only way to access it is through the use of a third-party cheat device such as a [[GameShark|Game Shark]] or [[Datel Action Replay|Action Replay]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Davidson |first1=Joey |title=Animal Crossing on Gamecube let you play full NES games for free, and it was amazing |url=https://www.technobuffalo.com/2016/08/21/animal-crossing-full-nes-games-gamecube/ |website=Techno Buffalo |accessdate=April 15, 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170415202007/https://www.technobuffalo.com/2016/08/21/animal-crossing-full-nes-games-gamecube/ |archivedate=April 15, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Virtual Console =====
''Super Mario Bros.'' has been re-released for several of Nintendo's game systems as a part of their [[Virtual Console]] line of classic video game releases. It was first released for the [[Wii]] on December 2, 2006 in [[Japan]], December 25, 2006 in North America and January 5, 2007 in [[PAL]] regions. The release is a complete emulation of the original game, meaning that nothing is changed from the its original NES release.&lt;ref name="gs vcReview" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wii.ign.com/articles/770/770594p1.html |title=Super Mario Bros.

A [[Nintendo 3DS]] release of the game was initially distributed exclusively to members of Nintendo's 3DS Ambassador Program in September 2011. A general release of the title later came through in Japan on January 5, 2012, in North America on February 16, 2012 and in Europe on March 1, 2012. The game was released for the [[Wii U]]'s Virtual Console in Japan on June 5, 2013, followed by Europe on September 12, 2013 and North America on September 19, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Super Mario Bros.

====Modified versions====
Several modified variants of the game have been released, many of which are [[ROM hack]]s of the original NES game. A promotional, graphically-modified version of the game titled '''''All Night Nippon Super Mario Bros.'''''{{efn|{{nihongo|''All Night Nippon Super Mario Bros.''|オールナイトニッポン スーパーマリオブラザーズ|Ōrunaito Nippon Sūpā Mario Burazāzu|lead=yes}}}} was officially released only in Japan in December 1986 for the Famicom Disk System as a promotional item given away by the popular Japanese radio show ''[[All Night Nippon]]'' and published by [[Fuji Television|Fuji TV]], the same company which later went on to publish ''Yume Kōjō: Doki Doki Panic'' (which was released outside of Japan as ''[[Super Mario Bros. 2]]''). (and in turn is extremely rare). The game features graphics based upon the show, with sprites of the enemies, mushroom retainers, and other characters being changed to look like famous Japanese music idols, recording artists, and DJs as well as other people related to ''All-Night Nippon''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Fletcher |first1=JC |title=Virtually Overlooked: All Night Nippon Super Mario Bros. |url=https://www.engadget.com/2008/08/14/virtually-overlooked-all-night-nippon-super-mario-bros/ |website=Engadget |accessdate=April 15, 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170415203007/https://www.engadget.com/2008/08/14/virtually-overlooked-all-night-nippon-super-mario-bros/ |archivedate=April 15, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The game also makes use of the same slightly upgraded graphics and alternate physics featured in ''Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels''. This version of the game is considered extremely rare, with copies going online for upwards of nearly $500.&lt;ref name="Nintendo Hax"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wired.com/2010/10/nintendo-hacks-super-mario-bros-for-limited-edition-wii/ |title=Nintendo Hacks Super Mario Bros. for Limited-Edition Wii |first=Chris |last=Kohler |date=October 7, 2010 |website=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |accessdate=February 19, 2018 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180220092340/https://www.wired.com/2010/10/nintendo-hacks-super-mario-bros-for-limited-edition-wii/ |archivedate=February 20, 2018 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 11, 2010, a special red variant of the Wii containing a pre-downloaded version of the game was released in Japan to celebrate ''Super Mario Bros''.'s 25th anniversary. This version of the game features several graphical changes, such as "?" blocks instead having the number "25" on them to symbolize the game's anniversary.&lt;ref name="Nintendo Hax"/&gt;

'''''Super Luigi Bros.''''', a redux of the game featuring [[Luigi]], was included as a feature within ''[[NES Remix 2]]'', based on a mission featured in the first ''[[NES Remix]]'' featuring Luigi in a backwards version of World 1-2. The player now controls Luigi instead of Mario, who now jumps higher and slides more when running on the ground similar to his appearance in the Japanese ''Super Mario Bros. 2'' (if the game's two-player mode is selected, both players control as Luigi), and the game's level designs are exactly the same as they are in the original ''Super Mario Bros'' but completely mirrored (i.e. the game scrolls from left-to-right rather than vice versa).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Wilson |first1=Jason |title=NES Remix 2's Super Luigi Bros. is a speedrunner's ass-backward nightmare |url=https://venturebeat.com/2014/04/10/nes-remix-2s-super-luigi-bros-is-a-speedrunners-ass-backward-nightmare/ |accessdate=May 31, 2016 |work=VentureBeat |date=April 10, 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160422020934/http://venturebeat.com/2014/04/10/nes-remix-2s-super-luigi-bros-is-a-speedrunners-ass-backward-nightmare/ |archivedate=April 22, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Little Mac Joins Super Smash Bros., Mario Kart 8 Launching May 30 with Koopalings &amp; More |url=http://www.comingsoon.net/games/trailers/114848-little-mac-joins-super-smash-bros-mario-kart-8-launching-may-30-with-koopalings-more |website=ComingSoon.net |accessdate=May 31, 2016 |date=February 14, 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160816223520/http://www.comingsoon.net/games/trailers/114848-little-mac-joins-super-smash-bros-mario-kart-8-launching-may-30-with-koopalings-more |archivedate=August 16, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jeremy Parish of ''[[1up.com]]'' called the game "The most fun you'll ever have while being robbed blind," ultimately giving the game a score of 80% and praising its larger-scaling screen compared to ''Deluxe'' while greatly criticizing its lack of new features.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.1up.com/article2/0,2053,1559332,00.asp |title=Super Mario Bros.

== Legacy ==
The success of ''Super Mario Bros.'' led to the development of many successors in the ''[[Super Mario]]'' series of video games, which in turn form the core of the greater [[Mario (franchise)|''Mario'' franchise]]. Two of these sequels, ''[[Super Mario Bros. 2]]'' and ''[[Super Mario Bros. 3]]'', were direct sequels to the game and were released for the NES, experiencing similar levels of commercial success. A different sequel, also titled ''Super Mario Bros. 2'', was released for the [[Famicom Disk System]] in 1986 exclusively in Japan, and was later released elsewhere as a part of ''[[Super Mario All-Stars]]'' under the name ''[[Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels]]''. The gameplay concepts and elements established in ''Super Mario Bros.'' are prevalent in nearly every ''Super Mario'' game. The series consists of over 15 entries; at least one ''Super Mario'' game has been released on nearly every Nintendo console to date. ''[[Super Mario 64]]'', an entry in the series and the first to take place in a three-dimensional environment, is widely considered one of the greatest games ever made, and is largely credited with revolutionizing the platforming genre of video games and its step from 2D to 3D. The most recent release is ''[[Super Mario Odyssey]]'', released in 2017 for the [[Nintendo Switch]]. The series is [[List of best-selling video game franchises|one of the best-selling]], with over 310 million copies of games sold worldwide as of September 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.yahoo.com/tech/happy-birthday-super-mario-181332681.html?nf=1 |title=Happy 30th birthday, 'Super Mario Bros.'! |author=Morris, Chris |date=September 13, 2015 |publisher=[[Yahoo!]] |work=Yahoo!

''Super Mario Bros.'' and its sequels inspired various projects in media; the 1986 [[anime]] film ''[[Super Mario Bros.: The Great Mission to Rescue Princess Peach!]]'' is acknowledged as one of the first feature-length films to be based directly off of a video game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Guinness Book of World Records 2015: Gamer's Edition |publisher=Guinness World Records |date=November 14, 2014 |page=179 |isbn=1908843667}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[live-action]] [[Super Mario Bros.

In the [[United States Supreme Court]] case ''[[Brown v. Entertainment Merchants Association]]'', the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] submitted an ''amicus'' brief which supported the overturn a law which would ban violent video games in the state of [[California]]. The brief cited social research that declared ''Super Mario Bros'', among several others, to contain cartoon violence similar to that found in children's programs such as [[Mighty Mouse]] and [[Wile E.

Video game developer [[Yuji Naka]] has cited ''Super Mario Bros.'' as a large inspiration towards the concept for the immensely successful 1991 [[Sega Genesis]] game, ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog (1991 video game)|Sonic the Hedgehog]]''; according to Naka, the general idea for the game first materialized when he was playing through game and trying to beat the game’s first level as quickly as possible, and thought about the concept of a platformer based around moving as fast as possible.&lt;ref name=altMW/&gt;

''Super Mario Bros.'' has served as inspiration for several [[fangame]]s. In 2009, developer SwingSwing released ''[[Tuper Tario Tros]]'', a game which combines elements of ''Super Mario Bros.'' with ''[[Tetris]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McWhertor|first=Michael|title=Tuper Tario Tros.

'''''The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening'''''{{efn|Known as {{nihongo|''Zeruda no Densetsu: Yume o Miru Shima''|ゼルダの伝説 夢をみる島||lit. The Legend of Zelda: The Dream Island}} in Japan.}} is a 1993 [[action-adventure game|action-adventure]] video game developed by [[Nintendo Entertainment Analysis &amp; Development]] and published by [[Nintendo]] for the [[Game Boy]]. It is the fourth installment in ''[[The Legend of Zelda]]'' series, and the first for a [[handheld game console]].

''Link's Awakening'' began as a port of the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]] title ''[[The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past]]'', developed after-hours by Nintendo staff. It grew into an original project under the direction of [[Takashi Tezuka]], with a story and script created by [[Yoshiaki Koizumi]] and [[Kensuke Tanabe]]. It is one of the few ''Zelda'' games not to take place in the land of [[Universe of The Legend of Zelda#Hyrule|Hyrule]], and does not feature [[Princess Zelda]] or the [[Triforce]] relic. Instead, protagonist [[Link (The Legend of Zelda)|Link]] begins the game stranded on Koholint Island, a place guarded by a [[whale]]-like [[deity]] called the Wind Fish. Assuming the role of Link, the player fights monsters and solves puzzles while searching for eight musical instruments that will awaken the sleeping Wind Fish and allow him to escape from the island.

''Link's Awakening'' was critically and commercially successful. Critics praised the game's depth and number of features; complaints focused on its control scheme and monochrome graphics. An updated re-release titled '''''The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening DX'''''{{efn|Known in Japan as {{nihongo|''Zeruda no Densetsu: Yume o Miru Shima Derakkusu''|ゼルダの伝説 夢をみる島DX|pronounced as The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening Deluxe}}&lt;!-- See [[WP:JFN]] --&gt;}} was released for the [[Game Boy Color]] in 1998 featuring color graphics, compatibility with the [[Game Boy Printer]], and an exclusive color-based dungeon. Together, the two versions of the game have sold more than six million units worldwide, and have appeared on multiple game publications' lists of the [[List of video games considered the best|best games of all time]].

==Plot==
===Setting and characters===
Unlike most ''[[The Legend of Zelda]]'' titles, ''Link's Awakening'' is set outside the kingdom of [[Hyrule]]. It omits locations and characters from previous games, aside from protagonist Link and a passing mention of [[Princess Zelda]].&lt;ref name="retrospective"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gametrailers.com/full-episodes/lc60ui/gt-retrospectives-zelda-retrospective-part-2|title=Zelda Retrospective Part 2|date=October 20, 2006|website=[[GameTrailers]]|publisher=[[MTV Networks]]|accessdate=March 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening DX|developer=[[Nintendo|Nintendo Co., Ltd]]|publisher=[[Nintendo|Nintendo of America Inc.]]|date=December 1, 1998|quote='''Marin:''' I thought you'd never wake up! You were tossing and turning... What? Zelda? No, my name's Marin!}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, the game takes place entirely on Koholint Island,&lt;ref name="retrospective"/&gt; an isolated landmass cut off from the rest of the world. The island, though small, contains a large number of secrets and interconnected pathways.&lt;ref name="history of la"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/gamespot/features/video/hist_zelda/page11.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051221112025/http://www.gamespot.com/gamespot/features/video/hist_zelda/page11.html|archivedate=December 21, 2005|title=History of Zelda|page=11|author1=Vestal, Andrew |author2=O'Neill, Cliff |author3=Shoemaker, Brad |website=[[GameSpot]]|publisher=[[CBS Interactive Inc]]|accessdate=December 4, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Link's Awakening'', the player is given advice and directions by [[non-player character]]s such as Ulrira, a shy old man who communicates with Link exclusively by telephone. The game contains [[cameo appearance]]s by characters from other Nintendo titles, such as [[Wart (character)|Wart]], [[Yoshi]], [[Kirby (character)|Kirby]], Dr. Wright (renamed Mr. Write) from the Super NES version of ''[[SimCity (1989 video game)|SimCity]]'', and the exiled prince Richard from ''[[Kaeru no Tame ni Kane wa Naru]]''.&lt;ref name="nintendopower-guide" /&gt;&lt;ref name="kirbychomp"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nintendo.co.uk/Iwata-Asks/Iwata-Asks-The-Legend-of-Zelda-Spirit-Tracks/Iwata-Asks-Zelda-Handheld-History-/2-Kirby-and-Chomps-in-Zelda/2-Kirby-and-Chomps-in-Zelda-233781.html|title=2.

===Plot===

The Wind Fish lies dreaming in a giant egg on top of Mt. Tamaranch, and can only be awakened by the eight Instruments of the Sirens.

Link proceeds to explore a series of dungeons in order to recover the eight instruments.  During his search for the sixth instrument, Link goes to the Ancient Ruins. There he finds a mural that details the reality of the island: that it is merely a dream world created by the Wind Fish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening DX |developer=[[Nintendo|Nintendo Co., Ltd]]|publisher=[[Nintendo|Nintendo of America Inc.]]|date=December 1, 1998|quote="To the finder, the isle of Koholint is but an illusion...

Throughout Koholint Island, nightmare creatures attempt to obstruct Link's quest for the instruments, as they wish to rule the Wind Fish's dreamworld.

After collecting all eight instruments from the eight dungeons across Koholint, Link climbs to the top of Mt.

Like most games in ''The Legend of Zelda'' series, ''Link's Awakening'' is an [[action-adventure game]] focused on exploration and combat.&lt;ref name="ign dx rev" /&gt; The majority of the game takes place from an overhead perspective.&lt;ref name="retrospective" /&gt; The player traverses the [[overworld]] of Koholint Island while fighting monsters and exploring underground dungeons. Dungeons steadily become larger and more difficult, and feature "Nightmare" [[Boss (video games)|boss]] characters that the player must defeat, taking different forms in each dungeon, and getting harder to defeat each time.&lt;ref name="manual" /&gt; Success earns the player heart containers, which increase the amount of damage the [[player character]] can survive; when all of the player's heart containers have been emptied, the game restarts at the last doorway entered by the character. Defeating a Nightmare also earns the player one of the eight instruments necessary to complete the game.&lt;ref name="manual"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening Instruction Booklet|pages=9–28|date=August 1993|publisher=[[Nintendo|Nintendo of America Inc]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Link's Awakening'' was the first overhead-perspective ''Zelda'' game to allow Link to jump; this enables [[side-scrolling video game|sidescrolling]] sequences similar to those in the earlier ''[[Zelda II: The Adventure of Link]]''.&lt;ref name="retrospective" /&gt; Players can expand their abilities with [[Item (game)|items]], which are discovered in dungeons and through character interactions. Certain items grant access to previously inaccessible areas, and are needed to enter and complete dungeons.

In addition to the main quest, ''Link's Awakening'' contains side-missions and diversions. Collectible "secret seashells" are hidden throughout the game; when twenty of these are found, the player can receive a powerful sword that fires energy beams when the player character is at full health, similar to the sword in the original ''[[The Legend of Zelda (video game)|The Legend of Zelda]]''. ''Link's Awakening'' is the first ''Zelda'' game to include a trading sequence [[minigame]]: the player may give a certain item to a character, who in turn gives the player another item to trade with someone else.&lt;ref name="manual" /&gt; It is also the first game in the ''Zelda'' series in which both the [[Game Boy#Features|A and B buttons]] may be assigned to a variety of items, which enables more varied puzzles and item combinations.&lt;ref name="retrospective" /&gt; Other series elements originating in ''Link's Awakening'' include fishing, and learning special songs on an [[ocarina]]; the latter mechanic is central to the next ''Zelda'' game released, ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time|Ocarina of Time]]''.&lt;ref name="history13"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/gamespot/features/video/hist_zelda/page13.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031016020629/http://www.gamespot.com/gamespot/features/video/hist_zelda/page13.html|archivedate=October 16, 2003|title=History of Zelda|page=13|author1=Vestal, Andrew |author2=O'Neill, Cliff |author3=Shoemaker, Brad |website=[[GameSpot]]|publisher=[[CBS Interactive Inc]]|accessdate=December 4, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clear}}

==Development==
''Link's Awakening'' began as an unsanctioned side project; programmer Kazuaki Morita created a ''Zelda''-like game with one of the first [[Game Boy]] [[development kit]]s, and used it to experiment with the platform's capabilities. Other staff members of the [[Nintendo Entertainment Analysis and Development]] division joined him [[wikt:after hours|after-hours]], and worked on the game in what seemed to them like an "afterschool club". The results of these experiments with the Game Boy started to look promising, and following the 1991 release of the Super NES video game ''[[The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past]]'', director [[Takashi Tezuka]] asked permission to develop a handheld ''Zelda'' title; he intended it to be a [[Video game porting|port]] of ''A Link to the Past'', but it evolved into an original game.&lt;ref name="iwata asks-afterschool club" /&gt; The majority of the team that had created ''A Link to the Past'' was reassembled to advance this new project. Altogether, it took them one and a half years to develop ''Link's Awakening''.&lt;ref name="laguide"&gt;{{cite book|title=Nintendo Official Guide Book – The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening|chapter=「ゼルダの伝説 夢をみる島」開発スタッフ名鑑|language=Japanese|pages=120–124|date=July 1993|isbn=978-4-09-102448-0|publisher=[[Shogakukan|Shogakukan Inc]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Yoshiaki Koizumi 2007.jpg|thumb|upright|Designer Yoshiaki Koizumi was in charge of the game's story, and conceived major plot points such as the dream world island setting.|alt=A long-haired man wearing a coat and a striped shirt.]]

Tezuka recalled that the early free-form development of ''Link's Awakening'' resulted in the game's "unrestrained" contents, such as the unauthorized cameo appearances of characters from the ''Mario'' and ''Kirby'' series.&lt;ref name="kirbychomp" /&gt; ''A Link to the Past'' script writer [[Kensuke Tanabe]] joined the team early on, and came up with the basis of the story.&lt;ref name="kirbychomp" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ladxguide"&gt;{{cite book|title=ゲームボーイ＆ゲームボーイカラー 任天堂公式ガイドブック ゼルダの伝説 夢を見る島DX|chapter=開発スタッフアンケート|language=Japanese|pages=108–111|date=February 20, 1999|isbn=978-4-09-102679-8|publisher=[[Shogakukan|Shogakukan Inc]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tezuka sought to make ''Link's Awakening'' a [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]], and gave Tanabe instructions to omit common series elements such as [[Princess Zelda]], the [[Triforce]] relic, and the setting [[Hyrule]].&lt;ref name="ladxguide" /&gt; As a consequence, Tanabe proposed his game world idea of an island with an egg on top of a mountain.&lt;ref name="ladxguide" /&gt;

Later on, [[Yoshiaki Koizumi]], who had previously helped with the plot of ''A Link to the Past'', was brought into the team.&lt;ref name="kirbychomp" /&gt;&lt;ref name="laguide" /&gt; Koizumi was responsible for the main story of ''Link's Awakening'', provided the idea of the island in a dream, and conceived the interactions with the villagers.&lt;ref name="ladxguide" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/gamelife/2007/12/interview-super/|title=Interview: Super Mario Galaxy Director On Sneaking Stories Past Miyamoto|date=December 4, 2007|author=Kohler, Chris|website=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired: GameLife]]|publisher=[[Condé Nast Digital]]|accessdate=June 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080208121619/http://www.next-gen.biz/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=8731&amp;Itemid=2|archivedate=February 8, 2008|title=Interview: Nintendo's Unsung Star|url=http://www.next-gen.biz/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=8731&amp;Itemid=2|date=February 6, 2008|website=[[Edge (magazine)|Next Generation]]|publisher=[[Future US, Inc.]]|accessdate=July 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Link's Awakening'' was described by series producer [[Eiji Aonuma]] as the first ''Zelda'' game with a proper plot, which he attributed to Koizumi's romanticism.&lt;ref name="suspicious"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nintendo.co.uk/Iwata-Asks/Iwata-Asks-The-Legend-of-Zelda-Spirit-Tracks/Iwata-Asks-Zelda-Handheld-History-/3-Make-All-Characters-Suspicious-Types/3-Make-All-Characters-Suspicious-Types-233845.html|title=Iwata Asks: The History of Handheld The Legend of Zelda Games – Make All the Characters Suspicious Types|date=January 2010|publisher=[[Nintendo|Nintendo of America Inc]]|accessdate=January 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tezuka intended the game's world to have a similar feeling to the American television series ''[[Twin Peaks]]'', which, like ''Link's Awakening'', features characters in a small town.&lt;ref name="kirbychomp" /&gt; He suggested that the characters of ''Link's Awakening'' be written as "suspicious types", akin to those in ''Twin Peaks''—a theme which carried over into later ''Zelda'' titles.&lt;ref name="suspicious" /&gt; Tanabe created these "odd" characters; he was placed in charge of the subevents of the story, and wrote almost all of the character dialog, with the exception of the owl's and the Wind Fish's lines.&lt;ref name="kirbychomp" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ladxguide" /&gt; Tanabe implemented a previous idea of the world ending when a massive egg breaks on top of a mountain; this idea was originally meant for ''A Link to the Past''. Tanabe really wanted to see this idea in a game and was able to implement it in ''Link's Awakening'' as the basic concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.officialnintendomagazine.co.uk/57137/features/monkey-men-talking-to-michael-kelbaugh-and-kensuke-tanabe/?page=1|title=Monkey Men: talking to Michael Kelbaugh and Kensuke Tanabe|date=February 19, 2014|author=Skrebels, Joe|website=[[Official Nintendo Magazine]]|publisher=[[Nintendo]]|accessdate=February 21, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140306201732/http://www.officialnintendomagazine.co.uk/57137/features/monkey-men-talking-to-michael-kelbaugh-and-kensuke-tanabe/?page=1|archive-date=March 6, 2014|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Masanao Arimoto and [[Shigefumi Hino]] designed the game's characters, while [[Yoichi Kotabe]] served as illustrator.&lt;ref name="credits"&gt;{{cite video game |title=The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening DX|developer=[[Nintendo|Nintendo Co., Ltd]]|publisher=[[Nintendo|Nintendo of America Inc.]]|date=December 1, 1998|scene=staff credits}}&lt;/ref&gt; Save for the opening and the ending, all pictures in the game were drawn by Arimoto.&lt;ref name="ladxguide" /&gt; Yasahisa Yamamura designed the dungeons, which included the conception of rooms and routes, as well as the placement of enemies.&lt;ref name="ladxguide" /&gt; [[Shigeru Miyamoto]], who served as the producer of ''Link's Awakening'', did not provide creative input to the staff members. However, he participated as [[game testing|game tester]], and his opinions greatly influenced the latter half of the development.&lt;ref name="laguide" /&gt;

The music for ''Link's Awakening'' was composed by Minako Hamano and Kozue Ishikawa, for whom it was their first game project.&lt;ref name="laguide" /&gt; [[Kazumi Totaka]] was responsible for the sound programming and all sound effects.&lt;ref name="laguide" /&gt; As with most ''Zelda'' games, ''Link's Awakening'' includes a variation of the recurring overworld music;&lt;ref name="second"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gametrailers.com/full-episodes/rdq37a/gt-retrospectives-zelda-retrospective-part-1|title=Zelda Retrospective Part 1|website=[[GameTrailers]]|publisher=[[MTV Networks]]|date=October 13, 2006|accessdate=March 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Game Boy arrangement of this theme, titled "Field", was created by Ishikawa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ymm.co.jp/p/detail.php?code=GTP01085505&amp;o=0#song |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5utxYs9Ef?url=http://www.ymm.co.jp/p/detail.php?code=GTP01085505&amp;o=0#song |archivedate=December 11, 2010 |script-title=ja:ピアノソロ ゼルダの伝説シリーズ/スーパーベスト |date=May 26, 2010 |language=Japanese |publisher=[[Yamaha Corporation|Yamaha Music Media Corporation]] |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The staff credits theme, "Yume o Miru Shima e" was later arranged for orchestra by [[Yuka Tsujiyoko]], and performed at the ''[[Orchestral Game Music Concerts|Orchestral Game Music Concert 3]]'' in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media notes|title=[[Orchestral Game Music Concerts|Orchestral Game Music Concert 3]]|year=1993|publisher=[[Sony Records]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Super Smash Bros.

In an interview about the evolution of the ''Zelda'' series, Aonuma called ''Link's Awakening'' the "quintessential [[Isometric projection|isometric]] ''Zelda'' game".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2004/03/26/gdc-2004-the-history-of-zelda|title=GDC 2004: The History of Zelda|date=March 25, 2004|website=[[IGN]]|publisher=IGN Entertainment, Inc |accessdate=February 4, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; At another time, he stated that, had the game not come after ''A Link to the Past'', ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time|Ocarina of Time]]'' would have been very different.&lt;ref name="suspicious" /&gt; Several elements from ''Link's Awakening'' were re-used in later ''Zelda'' titles; for example, programmer Morita created a fishing minigame that reappeared in ''Ocarina of Time'', among others. Tanabe implemented a trading sequence; Tezuka compared it to the Japanese [[Straw Millionaire]] folktale, in which someone trades up from a piece of straw to something of greater value. This concept also appeared in most sequels.&lt;ref name="kirbychomp" /&gt;

===Releases===
[[File:Game Boy Printer.png|thumb|upright|The [[Game Boy Printer]] accessory was compatible with the ''DX'' release of ''Link's Awakening''. Players could print out certain screenshots obtained in the game.]]

To support the North American release of ''Link's Awakening'', Nintendo sponsored a crosscountry train competition called the Zelda Whistle Stop Tour.&lt;ref name="whistle"&gt;{{cite news|title='Legend of Zelda' Still Growing|page=C1|date=August 20, 1993|author=Williamson, Matt|work=[[Rocky Mountain News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The event, which lasted three days, allowed select players to test ''Link's Awakening'' in a timed race to complete the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Riding the rails for Nintendo contest|page=B2|date=August 30, 1993|author=Bette, Harrison|work=[[The Atlanta Journal-Constitution]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The event was meant not only to showcase the game, but also the Game Boy's superior battery life and portability, the latter of which was critical to the accessibility of a portable ''Zelda'' title.&lt;ref name="retrospective" /&gt;&lt;ref name="whistle" /&gt; The company-owned magazine ''[[Nintendo Power]]'' published a guide to the game's first three areas in its July 1993 issue.&lt;ref name="nintendopower-guide"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[Nintendo Power]]|title='The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening' Guide|volume=1|issue=50|pages=57–66|date=July 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, to promote the launch of the [[Game Boy Color]], Nintendo re-released ''Link's Awakening'' as ''The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening DX''. It features fully colorized graphics and is [[Backward compatibility|backward compatible]] with the original Game Boy. ''Link's Awakening DX'' contains a new optional dungeon, with unique enemies and puzzles based on color (due to this the dungeon cannot be accessed on the earlier non-color Game Boy models).&lt;ref name="history of la" /&gt; After completing the dungeon, the player may choose to receive either a red or blue tunic, which increase attack and defense, respectively. The ''DX'' version also allows players to take photos after the player visits a camera shop, its owner will appear in certain locations throughout the game. A total of twelve photos can be taken, which may be viewed at the shop, or printed with the [[Game Boy Printer]] accessory.&lt;ref name="history of la" /&gt;&lt;ref name="mirror-review"&gt;{{cite news|title=Mega Mirror; Win two Game Boy games|work=The Mirror|page=41|date=February 27, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; For ''Link's Awakening DX'', Tezuka returned as project supervisor, with Yoshinori Tsuchiyama as the new director.&lt;ref name="ladxguide" /&gt; Nobuo Matsumiya collaborated with Tsuchiyama on applying changes to the original script; for example, hint messages were added to the boss battles.&lt;ref name="ladxguide" /&gt; For the new dungeon, Yuichi Ozaki created a musical piece based on Kondo's dungeon theme from the [[The Legend of Zelda (video game)|original ''The Legend of Zelda'']].&lt;ref name="ladxguide" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rpgfan.com/reviews/zeldagb/Zelda_4DX.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327130032/http://www.rpgfan.com/reviews/zeldagb/Zelda_4DX.html|archivedate=March 27, 2009|title=Reviews – The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening DX|date=February 7, 2000|author=Musashi|publisher=RPGFan|accessdate=June 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Tin Toy''''' is a 1988 American [[computer-animated]] [[short film]] produced by [[Pixar]] and directed by [[John Lasseter]]. The short film, which runs five minutes, stars Tinny, a tin [[one-man-band]] toy, attempting to escape from Billy, a destructive baby. The third short film produced by the company's small animation division, it was a risky investment: due to low revenue produced by Pixar's main product, the [[Pixar Image Computer]], the company was under financial constraints.

Lasseter pitched the concept for ''Tin Toy'' by storyboard to Pixar owner [[Steve Jobs]], who agreed to finance the short despite the company's struggles, which he kept alive with annual investment. The film was officially a test of the [[PhotoRealistic RenderMan]] software, and proved new challenges to the animation team, namely the difficult task of realistically animating Billy. ''Tin Toy'' later gained attention from [[Disney]], who sealed an agreement to create ''[[Toy Story]]'' starring [[Tom Hanks]] and [[Tim Allen]], which was primarily inspired by elements from ''Tin Toy''.

The short premiered in a partially completed edit at the [[SIGGRAPH]] convention in August 1988 to a standing ovation from scientists and engineers. ''Tin Toy'' went on to claim Pixar's first Oscar with the 1988 [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film|Best Animated Short Film]], becoming the first [[computer-generated imagery|CGI]] film to win an Oscar. With the award, ''Tin Toy'' went far to establish computer animation as a legitimate artistic medium outside SIGGRAPH and the animation-festival film circuit. ''Tin Toy'' was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant" in 2003.&lt;ref name = "JimHillMedia"/&gt;

==Plot==
The film takes place in one room and stars the toy of the title, a mechanical one-man band player named Tinny, and a baby named Billy. At first, Tinny is delighted at the prospect of being played with by Billy until he sees how destructive the baby can be. When Tinny tries to walk out of Billy's reach, the musical instruments on the toy's back play notes, attracting Billy's attention. Tinny begins to run, but is chased by Billy. Tinny soon finds cover under the couch, only to find that many other toys have also hidden themselves from Billy there since they are also afraid and have learned the same experience. While walking and trying to find Tinny and the other toys, Billy falls flat onto the floor and begins to cry. Tinny, feeling sorry for the baby, goes to the child to cheer him up. Billy stops crying upon seeing Tinny, cheers up, and grabs Tinny, but plays with him by shaking him, and finds the box Tinny was packaged in even more fun to play with. Mad, Tinny follows Billy around the room in an attempt to get his attention, but is still ignored, when the baby is instead happier playing with boxes and a shopping bag while some toys come out from the couch to play.

==Background==
Pixar, purchased in 1986 by entrepreneur and former [[Apple Computer]] head [[Steve Jobs]], received many accolades for films produced by its small animation division, headed by animator John Lasseter. Lasseter's primary role, as defended to Jobs by company founders Edwin Catmull and Alvy Ray Smith, was to produce short films to promote the company's own Pixar Image Computers.&lt;ref name="PixarTouch01"&gt;Price, p. 89&lt;/ref&gt; The department was never meant to generate any revenue as far as Jobs was concerned, but after the release of two shorts, ''[[Luxo Jr.]]'' (1986) and ''[[Red's Dream]]'' (1987), some of the engineers working on the company's products wondered whether it made sense to keep the animation group going at all.&lt;ref name="PixarTouch02"&gt;Price, p. 103&lt;/ref&gt; Pixar was losing money every year and Jobs was supporting the cash-strapped company through a line of credit with his personal guarantee.&lt;ref name="PixarTouch03"&gt;Price, p. 104&lt;/ref&gt;

The engineers felt they were working hard to make money for Pixar while Lasseter's group was only spending it. Their passion was for building computers and software, not entertainment. Eventually, they discerned, to their chagrin, the reason why the company was supporting the division: the real priority of Catmull and Smith was to make films.&lt;ref name="PixarTouch02"/&gt; The engineers were not alone in wondering about the value of Lasseter's short films. On repeated occasions in the late 1980s, Catmull barely dissuaded Jobs from shutting down the animation division due to financial constraints. At this same time, Jobs was clashing with Alvy Ray Smith, which would eventually lead to his resignation from Pixar after a heated argument during a meeting. Things were by no means well at the company and Lasseter and his team of animators knew this, and were afraid to ask for money to finance another short, which they storyboarded as ''Tin Toy''.&lt;ref name="Issacson01"&gt;{{cite book|last=Isaacson|first=Walter|title=[[Steve Jobs (book)|Steve Jobs]]|publisher=[[Simon &amp; Schuster]]|location=[[New York City|New York]]|year=2011|page=180|isbn=1-4516-4853-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
In the spring of 1988, cash was running so short that Jobs convened a meeting to decree deep spending cuts across the board. When it was over, Lasseter and his animation group were almost too afraid to ask Jobs about authorizing some extra money for another short. Finally, they broached the topic and Jobs sat silent, looking skeptical. The short would require close to $300,000 more out of his pocket. After a few minutes, he asked if there were any storyboards.&lt;ref name="Issacson01"/&gt; Catmull took him down to the animation offices, and Lasseter started his show. With the storyboards pinned on his wall, Lasseter did the voices and acted out the shots—just as story men had done on the Disney lot for decades—and thereby showed his passion for the project.&lt;ref name="PixarTouch03"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Issacson01"/&gt; The stakes here were much higher than before, however. [[Ralph Guggenheim]], manager of the animation unit, recalled, "We knew that he wasn't just pitching for the film, he was pitching for the survival of the group."&lt;ref name = "JimHillMedia"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://jimhillmedia.com/editor_in_chief1/b/jim_hill/archive/2008/08/01/i-can-go-to-disney-and-be-a-director-or-i-can-stay-here-and-make-history.aspx | title=I can go to Disney and be a director, or I can stay here and make history | publisher=JimHillMedia.com | date=July 31, 2008 | accessdate=March 5, 2012 | author=Hill, Jim}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PixarTouch03"/&gt; Jobs warmed up to the project and agreed to provide the money.&lt;ref name="Issacson01"/&gt; "I believed in what John was doing," Jobs later said. "It was art. He cared, and I cared. I always said yes." His only comment at the end of Lasseter’s presentation was, "All I ask of you, John, is to make it great."&lt;ref name="Isaacson02"&gt;{{cite book|last=Isaacson|first=Walter|title=[[Steve Jobs (book)|Steve Jobs]]|publisher=[[Simon &amp; Schuster]]|location=[[New York City|New York]]|year=2011|page=181|isbn=1-4516-4853-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:John Lasseter 2 cropped 2009.jpg|thumb|John Lasseter at the [[Venice Film Festival]] in [[66th Venice International Film Festival|2009]].]]
That fall, after completion of ''Red's Dream'', most members of the company gathered at [[Stillwater Cove]], near [[Fort Ross]], to design a new software that was designed completely for the work of an animator.&lt;ref name=amidi24&gt;{{citation|title=Amidi|page= 24}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the meeting came Menv software ("modeling Environment"), the first program specifically designed to facilitate the workflow of an animator, separating the various phases of the animation ([[Computer simulation|modeling]], [[animation]] and [[lighting]]), later renamed ''Puppets''.&lt;ref name="amidi24"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-8C1x4tXAQ|title=The Pixar Shorts: A Short History}} 0:06:32 [[Walt Disney Pictures]]&lt;/ref&gt; To show the application of the new program, it was approved the production of a short. Inspired by the birth of his daughter Julia, [[William Reeves (animator)|William Reeves]] proposed the idea to create a human baby.&lt;ref name="amidi24"/&gt; Lasseter had an inspiration for the new opera based on the observation of his nephew, intent to put any toy in the mouth on the way. Lasseter said "In terms of toys the child must have seemed a terrible monster!"&lt;ref name="PixarTouch06"&gt;Price, p. 305&lt;/ref&gt;

The story was about Lasseter’s love, classic toys, and was inspired by a visit made in 1987 at the Tin Toy Museum in [[Yokohama, Japan]].&lt;ref&gt;"Audio commentary to the short Tin Toy". [[John Lasseter]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Amidi | pages=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was told from the perspective of a toy one-man band named Tinny, who meets a baby that charms and terrorizes him. Escaping under the couch, Tinny finds other frightened toys, but when the baby hits his head and cries, Tinny goes back out to cheer him up.&lt;ref name="Issacson01"/&gt; ''Tin Toy'' was inspired much like ''Luxo Jr.'', namely, Lasseter's observations of a friend's baby.

==Release==
Lasseter and his technical directors slept under their desks at times to get ''Tin Toy'' finished before SIGGRAPH in [[Atlanta]] in August 1988, but to no avail. What the SIGGRAPH audience saw was the first three-fifths or so of the film, ending a cliffhanger moment with Tinny running into his box and watching in horror through the box's cellophane as Billy advances towards him.&lt;ref name="PixarTouch04"/&gt; "Even though it wasn't complete, people were wowed by it," producer Ralph Guggenheim remembered.&lt;ref name="PixarTouch04"/&gt; The audience of scientists and engineers to which it was shown at SIGGRAPH greeted it with a standing ovation.&lt;ref name = "JimHillMedia"/&gt; These praises were joined over the years, positive assessments of public and critics, who praised the innovation and technology in it. Luke Bonanno called it "One of the best Pixar short films,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dvdizzy.com/pixarshorts-vol1.html | title=Pixar Short Films Collection, Volume 1 | publisher=dvdizzy.com | date=November 2007 | accessdate=March 6, 2012 | author=Bonanno, Luke}}&lt;/ref&gt; while other critics wrote that the film was "A fascinating glimpse of a fledgling art form."&lt;ref name="DVDVerdict"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/pixarcollection1.php | title=Pixar Short Films Collection: Volume 1 | publisher=DVD Verdict | date=December 3, 2007 | accessdate=March 6, 2012 | author=Adam Arseneau, Judge | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120130000039/http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/pixarcollection1.php | archivedate=January 30, 2012 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and many praised the ability to move in just a few minutes and have been able to "encompass the full range of emotions you feel when a toy is used by a child."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/pixarshortsbluray.php | title=Pixar Short Films Collection: Volume 1 (Blu-Ray) | publisher=DVD Verdict | date=February 2, 2008 | accessdate=March 6, 2012 | author=Michael Stailey | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120127104039/http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/pixarshortsbluray.php | archivedate=January 27, 2012 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some criticisms were leveled at the character of Billy, who was called "the most frightening and disturbing piece of animation in the history of this art form."&lt;ref name="DVDVerdict"/&gt; Dario Floreano stated that the [[uncanny valley]] concept was taken seriously by the film industry because of negative audience reactions to Billy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.unexplainable.net/artman/publish/article_13844.shtml | title=Cattle Rustlin' in the Uncanny Valley | date=September 29, 2009 | accessdate=March 6, 2012 | author=Capps, Chris}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is unknown when this short was first released in its entirety.

''Tin Toy'' went on to take the [[Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film|Best Animated Short]] in 1989 at the [[61st Academy Awards]] and was the first computer generated animated short film to receive an Oscar. With the award, ''Tin Toy'' went far to establish computer animation as a legitimate artistic medium outside SIGGRAPH and the animation-festival film circuit.&lt;ref name="PixarTouch05"&gt;Price, p. 106&lt;/ref&gt; A member of the Academy's board of governors, animator William Littlejohn, saw in ''Tin Toy'' a window into the potential of the young medium. "There is a realism that's rather astonishing," he told ''[[The New York Times]]''. "It emulates photography, but with artistic staging."&lt;ref name="PixarTouch05"/&gt; Robert Winquist, head of the character animation program at [[CalArts]], went farther, predicting that computer animation was "going to take over in a short time." He publicly advised animators, "Put down your pencil and your paintbrush and do it another way."&lt;ref name="PixarTouch05"/&gt;

The short was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant" in 2003.&lt;ref name = "JimHillMedia"/&gt;

==Merchandising==
Apart from the home video editions of the short film, ''Tin Toy'' was not the subject of any type of merchandise, like all the other short films produced by the company. The only exception is the reproduction of vinyl Tinny, produced by MINDStyle in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mindstyle.com/blog/?p=3950|title=The Art Of Pixar|publisher=MINDstyle|date=August 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pixar, in fact, sold the license to the manufacturer of ''Tin Toy'' MINDStyle objects, which created a marquette of the vinyl character Tinny inside of the line Art Toy Collectible limited Edition of 500 pieces, the price of ninety dollars. The box, which is a faithful reproduction of the packaging of the toy view in short, in addition to containing the model of Tinny, presents a certificate of authenticity printed on a card showing the storyboard in pencil of a scene from the short.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mwctoys.com/REVIEW_081110a.htm|title=Pixar's Tin Toy MINDStyle|publisher=Captain Toy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scrapped sequel==
In the early 1990s, Pixar began to make arrangements with Disney to produce the first computer-animated film. The project went through, but considering the abrupt transition from shorts to feature a few minutes to an hour and a half, Pixar set out to create a special half-hour to see if they could manage a production that was similar to that of an actual film. Driven by the victory at the Oscars that year, a sequel to ''Tin Toy'' called "A Tin Toy Christmas," was originally planned as a half-hour-long television special to be used to convince film studios that Pixar was capable of producing a feature film.&lt;ref name="TinToyChristmasJimHill"/&gt; This idea was brought to the table at the initial talks with Disney for ''[[Toy Story]]''. The basic idea was that Tinny was part of a set of toy players who are not successful and remain unsold for years. Separated from other components, Tinny ends up by mistake in a toy shop of our age where he meets several characters, including a soft pink bear named Lotso.&lt;ref name="TinToyChristmasJimHill"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://jimhillmedia.com/editor_in_chief1/b/jim_hill/archive/2007/12/14/tube-thursday-the-pixar-holiday-special-you-never-got-to-see-tin-toy-christmas.aspx | title=The Pixar TV special you never got to see, "A Tin Toy Christmas" | publisher=JimHillMedia.com | date=December 14, 2007 | accessdate=March 6, 2012 | author=Hill, Jim}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/toy_story_3/news/1888969/2/its_toy_hell_says_toy_story_3_director/ | title=It's Toy Hell, Says Toy Story 3 Director. | publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] | date=June 18, 2010 | accessdate=March 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The project was abandoned because the television network that would have produced it could not afford the fees required (according to director [[Pete Docter]], the special would have required a sum of eighteen times higher than the allowed budget).&lt;ref name="TinToyChristmasJimHill"/&gt; Disney was uninterested in the concept and urged Pixar to produce a feature immediately, which became a critical and commercial success.&lt;ref&gt;''To Infinity and Beyond!: The Story of Pixar Animation Studios''&lt;/ref&gt; The character of Lotso, however, was adapted for the [[Toy Story 3|third installment]] of the [[Toy Story (franchise)|''Toy Story'' series]].&lt;ref name="TinToyChristmasJimHill"/&gt;

'''Utian''' (also '''Miwok–Costanoan''', previously '''Mutsun''') is a [[Indigenous languages of the Americas|family of indigenous languages]] spoken in [[Northern California]], [[United States]]. The [[Miwok]] and [[Ohlone]] peoples both spoke languages of the Utian language family. It has recently been argued that the Utian languages and [[Yawelmani language|Yokuts languages]] are sub-families of the [[Yok-Utian]] language family ([[Catherine Callaghan|Callaghan]] 1997, 2001; Golla 2007:76-77). Utian and Yokutsan have traditionally been considered part of the [[Penutian languages|Penutian]] language phylum (Goddard 1996:313-319; Mithun 1999; Shipley 1978:82-85).

All Utian languages are severely [[endangered language|endangered]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1335">'''Vatsun''' is derived from Sanskrit ‘Vachan’ meaning word/speech. This is because it has no particular pattern of versification or rhyme scheme.&lt;ref&gt;Ayyappapanicker, K. and Sahitya Akademi ''Medieval Indian Literature: An Anthology.'' 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; The metres and rhyme schemes of vatsun are varied, but generally each unit is a stanza of three lines followed by a refrain (vooj). Vatsun bears a resemblance to [[Urdu|Urdu lyric]]. Vatsun is also similar to the [[ghazal]]s of the Middle East and [[iambic pentameter]] of the Western world.

In poetry it is a popular age-old folk-form dating back to the fourteenth century, when [[Lal Ded]] and Hazart Sheikh-ul-Alam (alias [[Nund Reshi|Nund Rishi]]) wrote in Kashmiri language the devotional poetry depicting their mystic experiences, love for God, love for others, and folk dancing.&lt;ref&gt;"Vatsun."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5115">In the study of language and [[literary style]], a '''vulgarism''' is an expression or usage considered [[standard language|non-standard]] or characteristic of uneducated speech or writing. In [[colloquial]] or [[Lexical definition|lexical]] English, "vulgarism" or "vulgarity" may be [[synonym]]ous with [[profanity]] or [[obscenity]], but a linguistic or literary vulgarism encompasses a broader category of perceived fault not confined to [[scatology|scatological]] or sexual offensiveness. These faults may include [[Received Pronunciation|errors of pronunciation]], [[orthography|misspellings]], word malformations,&lt;ref name="Tromp"&gt;Johannes Tromp, ''The Assumption of Moses: A Critical Edition with Commentary'', ''Studia in Veteris Testamenti Pseudepigrapha'' (Brill, 1993), pp. 27, 39–40, 243.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[malapropism]]s. "[[wikt:vulgarity|Vulgarity]]" is generally used in the more restricted sense. In regular and mostly informal conversations, the presence of vulgarity, if any, are mostly for intensifying, exclaiming or scolding. In modern times, vulgarism continues to be frequently used by people. A [[research]] paper produced by [[Oxford University]] in 2005 shows that the age group of 10-21 years old speak more vulgarity than the rest of the world's [[population]] combined. The frequent and prevalent usage of vulgarity as a whole has led to a [[paradox]], in which people use vulgarity so often that it becomes less and less offensive to people, according to the [[New York Times]].

==Classicism==
The English word "vulgarism" derives ultimately from [[Latin]] ''vulgus,'' "the common people", often as a [[pejorative]] meaning "the [unwashed] masses, undifferentiated herd, a mob". In [[classical studies]], [[Vulgar Latin]] as the Latin of everyday life is conventionally contrasted to [[Classical Latin]], the [[literary language]] exemplified by the [[Latin literature|"Golden Age"]] [[literary canon|canon]] ([[Cicero]], [[Caesar]], [[Vergil]], [[Ovid]], among others).&lt;ref name="Adams"&gt;J. N. Adams, ''Bilingualism and the Latin Language'', pp. 300–301, 765, ''et passim''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Social Variation and the Latin Language'' (Cambridge University Press, 2013), pp. 3–5.&lt;/ref&gt; This distinction was always an untenable mode of [[literary criticism]], unduly problematizing, for instance, the so-called "Silver Age" novelist [[Petronius]], whose complex and sophisticated prose style in the ''[[Satyricon]]'' is full of conversational vulgarisms.&lt;ref name="Laird"&gt;Andrew Laird, ''Powers of Expression, Expressions of Power: Speech Presentation and Latin Literature'' (Oxford University Press, 1999), p. 250.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social class==
Vulgarism has been a particular concern of [[British English]] traditionalists.&lt;ref name="Crowley"&gt;Tony Crowley, ''Language in History: Theories and Texts'' (Routledge, 1996), pp. 168&amp;ndash;169.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1920s, the English [[lexicographer]] [[Henry Wyld]] defined "vulgarism" as:&lt;blockquote&gt;a peculiarity which intrudes itself into [[Standard English]], and is of such a nature as to be associated with the speech of vulgar or uneducated speakers. The origin of pure ''vulgarisms'' is usually that they are importations, not from a regional but from a class [[dialect]]—in this case from a dialect which is not that of a province, but of a low or uneducated social class. ... [A vulgarism] is usually a variety of Standard English, but a bad variety.&lt;ref name="Wyld"&gt;Henry Wyld, as quoted by Crowley (1996) p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; The moral and aesthetic values explicit in such a definition depends on [[social class|class hierarchy]] viewed as authoritative.&lt;ref name="Crowley" /&gt; For instance, the "misuse" of [[Aspirated consonant|aspiration]] ([[H-dropping]], such as pronouncing "have" as {{"'}}ave") has been considered a mark of the lower classes in England at least since the late 18th century,&lt;ref name="Crowley" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Görlach"&gt;Manfred Görlach, ''English in Nineteenth-Century England: An Introduction'' (Cambridge University Press, 1999), p. 57&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ihalainen"&gt;Ossi Ihalainen, "The Dialects of English since 1776", in ''The Cambridge History of the English Language'' (Cambridge University Press, 1994), vol. 5, pp. 216–217.&lt;/ref&gt; as dramatized in ''[[My Fair Lady]]''. Because linguistic vulgarism betrayed social class, its avoidance became an aspect of [[etiquette]]. In 19th-century England, books such as ''The Vulgarisms and Improprieties of the English Language'' (1833) by W. H. Savage, reflected upper-middle-class anxieties about "correctness and good breeding".&lt;ref name="Görlach" /&gt;

Vulgarisms in a literary work may be used deliberately to further [[characterization]],&lt;ref name="Tromp" /&gt;{{rp|39}}&lt;ref name="Adams" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Görlach" /&gt; by use of "[[eye dialect]]" or simply by [[vocabulary]] choice.

'''''Wakfu: The Animated Series''''' is a French animated television series produced by [[Ankama|Ankama Animation]], based on the [[video game]] ''[[Wakfu]]''. The first season of 26 episodes began airing on 30 October 2008, and new episodes would continue to air into January 2010 on [[France 3]]. The show is animated with [[Adobe Flash]] software; all the production is done in [[France]] except the special episodes "Noximilien l'Horloger" and "Ogrest, la Légende", both produced in [[Japan]]. The series is directed by Anthony "Tot" Roux, and character design is directed by Xavier "Xa" Houssin and Kim "Tcho" Etinoff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://serie.wakfu.com/fr/coulisses/character-designer|title=''Making of''|accessdate=December 20, 2009|publisher=Ankama Animation|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091230081454/http://serie.wakfu.com/fr/coulisses/character-designer|archive-date=December 30, 2009|dead-url=yes|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A spin-off called ''Mini-Wakfu'', which features humorous shorts with characters depicted in super deformed style has aired since September 2009. The special episode "Noximilien l'Horloger", the origin story of the main antagonist, Nox, was produced in Japan and features a radically different art style made by the same team of animators who worked on ''[[Kaiba]]'' and ''[[Kemonozume]]''. The episode was directed by Eunyoung Choi with [[Masaaki Yuasa]] on character design. A successful [[Kickstarter]] campaign to produce an English-language dub of the series was launched in January 2014.&lt;ref name="Ankama"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.ankama.com/en/animations|title=''Ankama's Animation Page''|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were two prior English dub attempts. The first two episodes were shown for the first time in English during the 2009 [[London MCM Expo]]; this dub pilot is believed to have been recorded in France by expats, many of whom previously worked on the English version of [[Code Lyoko]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wakfu.com/en/forum/77-animated-series/2050-wakfu-london-mcm-expo|title=Wakfu London MCM Expo|publisher=WAKFU FORUM}}&lt;/ref&gt; A second English dub pilot recorded by [[Ocean Studios]] was shown at [[Anime Expo]] in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ud3rkx-3I4w&amp;t=24m33s|title=AX 2011: The Introduction to the World of WAKFU Panel|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=2018-04-02|date=2011-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:Yugo is a 12-year-old Eliatrope who recently discovered his powers, and is on a mission to find his true family. He has lived with his adoptive father Alibert, working alongside him at his inn, and has no memories of his real family. He has the ability to summon teleportation portals by rotating his hand in a circular motion and throwing them to where he would like to appear. As the series progresses, he learns other abilities, such as moving at high speeds and creating beams from his portals. Near the end of Season Two, it's revealed that he is the King of the Eliatropes.  In the Special Episodes following the second season, Yugo is shown to have not aged in 6 years since the quest of the Crimson Claws, a fact that depresses him as he wishes to be able to court Amalia, but fears that his childlike appearance would hinder any chance of a serious relationship with her.  The finale shows Yugo is able to utilize the 6 Eliatrope Dofus to attain godly power in an effort to defeat Ogrest but doing so costs him his brother's friendship and nearly destroys the world.
:In Season 3, it is shown that Yugo and Ruel have been trying to find Adamai everywhere, to no avail. When Adamai, using their psychic link, shows Yugo the seeming death of Percedal, Yugo rushes to help his friend, still unable to believe his brother could be capable of such evil. It's later revealed that his actions later brought about the birth of the season's antagonist, Oropo, who is an evil counterpart of Yugo. During the final battle with Oropo, joined by Percidal and a now realized Adamai, he and his friends are last seen in the realm of the gods.

:;Az
::A "Tofu" (bird) that is always seen by Yugo's side.

;Princess Amalia Sheran Sharm 
:''Voiced by'': Adeline Chetail (French); [[Jessica Bell]] &lt;small&gt;''(Season 1-2 &amp; OVAs)''&lt;/small&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;, [[Christine Marie Cabanos]] &lt;small&gt;''(Season 3)''&lt;/small&gt; (English)
:Known as the Adventurer-Princess, she is a 13-year-old [[Dofus#Characters classes|Sadida]]. Because of this, she is able to talk to plants as well as control them. She is devoted to her friends and to helping Yugo find his family. Later, near the end of season one, it is revealed that she dislikes and has many disputes with her brother Armand. The Special Episodes 6 years after season two show Amalia has taken her mother's position as Queen of the Sadida and her forced marriage to Count Harebourg of Frigost begins the story. Though she initially accepts his proposal, she avoids the agreement after learning the Count planned to use the Sadida forests as a fuel source for his kingdom. By the finale, Amalia and Yugo have shown a strong desire to be with each other, in spite of the difficulties caused by the difference in their races. As of Season 3, Amalia has withdrawn from society and rarely leaves her sick father's side, but agrees to leave to look for Percedal with Yugo when he comes asking for help. The strain of their relationship is tested throughout their adventure. By the end of the final battle, Amalia hugs Yugo who returns it with a kind smile.

;Sir Percedal of Sadlygrove (also nicknamed Dally in the English dub), ''(Messire Tristepin de Percedal, lit. Sir Sadlygrove of Percedal; nicknamed Pinpin (Grovy) in French)'' 
:''Voiced by'': Thomas Guitard (French); Ross Grant &lt;small&gt;''(Season 1-2 &amp; OVAs)''&lt;/small&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;, [[Kyle McCarley]] &lt;small&gt;''(Season 3)''&lt;/small&gt; (English)
:A 16-year-old [[Dofus#Characters classes|lop]], Percedal is a "Knight of the Order of the Guardians of Shushus", entrusted with the guardianship of the demon-sword Rubilax. He acts brave but foolhardy and is a strong fighter. As a Guardian, Percedal is responsible for making sure Rubilax does not escape its sword prison and possess its owner, or others, though when he is possessed by Rubilax he becomes a monster that is incredibly physically strong. He is questing with Yugo as repayment for Yugo's rescuing him from Rubilax's possession. As the series progresses, he falls in love with Evangelyne and she with him. He becomes a father to twins, Elely and Flopin in the Special episodes and is revealed to be the reincarnation of the Iop God, but he loses his powers during the fight with Ogrest when he loses his right arm. In Season 3, Percedal is living with Eva and their two children, training Elely (who more Iop-ish and like her father) in the art of fighting. When assassins attack them to steal the children and a pregnant Eva, Percedal and his family fight them off but when Adamai shows up, he is no match for him. Dropped off a cliff, Percedal almost dies and makes a deal with Rubilax to release him if he helps him save his family. While he fought to save Evangelyne and Flopin, he is forced to fight his former master as the replacement Iop God chosen by Oropo.

:;Rubilax 
::''Voiced by'': Gérard Surugue &lt;small&gt;''(Most Episodes)''&lt;/small&gt;, Jean-Pierre Michael &lt;small&gt;''(Season 2, Episode 19)''&lt;/small&gt; (French); Keir Stewart &lt;small&gt;''(Season 1-2 &amp; OVAs)''&lt;/small&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;, [[Doug Erholtz]] &lt;small&gt;''(Season 3)''&lt;/small&gt; (English)
::A Shushu, or a demon trapped in an object, in the form of a gem on the hilt of Percedal's sword. He is obsessed with destruction and lends strength to any being he possesses. He is usually in the form of a [[dagger]] but can grow to the size of a [[longsword]]. His true form is a knee-high demon, however, he is still incredibly strong for his size and grows bigger every time he is hit. Rubilax can also create a small army of strong clay warrior-clones. As his time with the Brotherhood progresses, he eventually grows attached to the group, enough so to rebel against his own kind. In Season 3, Adamai shatters the sword, damaging Rubilax. As Percedal lays dying, Rubilax makes a deal with him to release the Shushu after he helps him save his family - turning into Percedal's missing right arm, able to take any shape. However, Ruel notes that upon their Guardian's death a Shushu would be released, hinting that Rubilax made the deal to save Percedal's life.

;Ruel Stroud 
:''Voiced by'': Patrick Bethune (French); Hugo Chandor &lt;small&gt;''(Season 1-2 &amp; OVAs)''&lt;/small&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;, [[Keith Silverstein]] &lt;small&gt;''(Season 3)''&lt;/small&gt; (English)
:Ruel is an old friend of Yugo's adoptive father Alibert, as well as a treasure- and bounty-hunter known as an [[Dofus#Characters classes|Enutrof]]. As a favor to Alibert, Ruel agrees to accompany Yugo on his travels. Ruel is greedy and stingy. He is skilled as a fighter and is committed to seeing Yugo through the trouble. Ruel wields a gold-plated shovel as a weapon. In season 3, it's revealed he's a demi-god son of Enutrop and targeting by the Siblings into joining their group, much like Sadlygrove's and Evangelyne's kids. Also, he has an estranged wife, Arpagone, who is with the Siblings.

:;Junior
::A pig-like mole creature called a dhreller, which are said to be usual pets of Enutrofs. When he started to tag along, Ruel would try to drive it away. It is later revealed it is because after the death of his first drheller, Kamasu-Tar, he did not wish to have another one. It isn't until he saves Ruel from a Sadida prison that Ruel starts to show a liking to him, and now he is regularly by his side. Ruel later teaches him how to identify minerals through tasting rocks and tracks.

;Evangelyne 
:''Voiced by'': Geneviève Doang (French); [[Jules de Jongh]] &lt;small&gt;''(Season 1-2 &amp; OVAs)''&lt;/small&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;, [[Kira Buckland]] &lt;small&gt;''(Season 3)''&lt;/small&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite tweet|user=rinachan|author=Kira Buckland|number=980452270360932353|title=I am so ecstatic to be taking on the role of Evangelyne for #wakfu season 3 on Netflix! When this series first came out years ago, I remember thinking about how I wish I could be her voice—so it’s unreal to think it actually came true a long time later! I hope you enjoy it &lt;3 https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DZtEIy7W0AIzrWk.jpg|date=1 Apr 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; (English)
:A 17-year-old [[Dofus#Characters classes|Cra]], Evangelyne is accompanying the Sadida princess Amalia as a bodyguard. She is committed to her job but also acts as an older sister to the young Amalia. She wields a [[bow (weapon)|bow]] that can fire a variety of magic arrows, making a [[quiver]] unnecessary. At first, she shows no attraction to Percedal but as the series progresses she admits that she loves him and starts a family with him by the time of the Special Episodes, marrying him at the end. In Season 3, it is revealed that Eva is pregnant and living with Percedal and their two children, Elely and Flopin. When assassins attack them, she fights back but she and Flopin are captured and taken by Adamai. Before the final battle, she is forced to give birth and, with help from Echo and Flopin, she safely gives birth to a second son, one whose powers were a threat to Oropo throughout the remainder of the season.

;Adamaï 
:''Voiced by'': Dorothee Pousseo (French); [[Joanna Ruiz]] &lt;small&gt;''(Season 1-2 &amp; OVAs)''&lt;/small&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;, [[Cristina Valenzuela]] &lt;small&gt;''(Season 3)''&lt;/small&gt; (English)
:A shape-shifting dragon who comes into contact with Yugo during their visit to the island of Oma and is revealed to be Yugo's brother, born of the same dofus. After separating from his friends, Yugo trains alongside Adamaï in order to control his wakfu and stop Nox from his sinister plans. Following the Special Episodes, Adamaï has severed ties with Yugo and the Brotherhood, after Yugo attacked him in order to utilize the Eliatrope Dofus to challenge Ogrest.  His current whereabouts are unknown, except that he is now allied with the Forgotten Brotherhood, led by Lady Echo. In Season 3, it is revealed that Adamai joined Lady Echo's brotherhood of other god-offsprings, and now has a more adult looking half-humanoid, half-dragon form. He also stole the three Eliatrope Dofus from Goultard and attached them to his back, gaining incredible powers - he effortlessly defeats Percedal and tosses him off a cliff, sharing the scene via a mind-like with Yugo. He is after Percedal's kids, them being offspring of a god as well, so they can join the Brotherhood. However, after realizing that Oropo's plan involved letting the Elia Cube absorb the Dofu eggs, transforming it into a bomb powerful enough to destroy the worlds, Adamai betrays Oropo and sides with Yugo to fight back. He is last seen with his friends again after they fled to the realm of the gods before Oropo.

;Grufon ('''Skribble''' in the English dub)
:''Voiced by'': Damien Da Silva (French); [[Arthur Bostrom]] (English)&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
:A minor Shushu, who has been trapped inside a map. In the beginning, he would only show the group where to go if they flattered him, but he would never give them proper directions. He was later eaten by an Arachnee (a spider-like creature) but ended up possessing the Arachnee and attacking the group. After being captured, Yugo promised to be Skribble's guardian if he would let them go. Skribble agreed and has since then been more agreeable to show the proper way.

Dream role unlocked!!!! &lt;3 https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DZq6q67VMAA2oZz.png|date=1 Apr 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; (English)
:The twin children of Sir Percedal of Sadlygrove and Evangelyne, Elely is the daughter and is as wild and unpredictable as her father, while Flopin is the son and is as calm and cool as his mother, and is equally skilled with a wrist-mounted crossbow. When their parents and the other members of the Brotherhood were held hostage by Count Harebourg, they stormed the palace to rescue them. Flopin used his mom's bow to help free the Brotherhood while Elely merged with Rubilax to give them a fighting chance, with their fighting skills impressing their parents. After the climactic battle Yugo and Percedal have with Ogrest, and after Ogrest returned to a normal baby ogre, Elely was the first person in ages to make friends with him. In Season 3, the kids have grown slightly. Elely is a lot like her father, training hard and is shown to be able to defeat an opponent many time her size "using her head" - for pummeling them to submission. Flopin is the more reserved and bookish of the kids, being more like his mother. He ends up captured alongside her by Adamai but both later escape and they reunite with the rest of their family.

===Secondary characters===

====Sadida====
They are a humanoid species who are close to all things [[Mother Nature]], and are most noticeable for being [[barefoot]], green hair, dark skin, and wearing clothes made out of leaves. The males have their hair covering their entire heads. They are all connected to the Tree of Life.

;King Oakheart Sheran Sharm
:''Voiced by'': Phillipe Dumond (French); Tom Clarke-Hill &lt;small&gt;''(Season 1-2 &amp; OVAs)''&lt;/small&gt;, [[Kirk Thornton]] &lt;small&gt;''(Season 3)''&lt;/small&gt; (English)
:Amalia's father and king of the [[Dofus#Characters classes|Sadida]] people. He is a jolly man as well as not familiar with formalities despite his king status, always questioning why Eva would always bow before him. He temporarily left his post to Armand when the Tree of Life was sick, trying to cure it. He later regains his throne after being informed of Nox's plan by Amalia and Eva. In Season 3, it is revealed the King is gravely ill and confined to his bed, and expects to die soon. 

;Queen Sheran Sharm
:She died before the start of the story. The king says that Amalia is the spitting image of her, both stubborn and adventurous. However, she appears in Evangeline's dream in her time at the Tree of Life

;Prince Armand Sheran Sharm
:''Voiced by'': Cedric Dumond (French); James Nickerson &lt;small&gt;''(Season 1-2 &amp; OVAs)''&lt;/small&gt;, [[Doug Erholtz]] &lt;small&gt;''(Season 3)''&lt;/small&gt; (English)
:Amalia's Brother and acting ruler of the [[Dofus#Characters classes|Sadida]] while the king is away. He is an arrogant man and believed the warning about Nox from his sister was nothing but her own imagination. He is attracted to Evangelyne, something that creeps her out and causes Percedal to become jealous. Armand also appears to have a racist view towards [[Dofus#Characters classes|Iops]], often insulting them. He is known to have very bad breath, a subject he is very touchy about, though is well known to the [[Dofus#Characters classes|Sadida]]. Despite all this, however, it is shown he truly does care for his little sister. In Season 3, due to the king's illness, Armand has all but taken over the throne and is constantly annoyed by how his sister does not care about politics. He is married to an Osamodas princess and is trying to marry off Amalia as well. 

;Chamberlain Toufdrue
:''Voiced by'': Gérard Surugue (French)

;Canar &amp; Renate
:''Canar voiced by'': Arnaud Laurent (French)
:''Renate voiced by'': Damien Da Silva (French)

====Other====
;Alibert 
:''Voiced by'': Thierry Mercier (French); Joe Mills (English)
:Yugo's adoptive father, who found him as a baby when Grougaloragran left him at the beginning of the series. He is also the town mayor and a chef, who runs an inn. After taking the young boy under his care, Alibert has also ingrained a magical message through his eyes regarding Yugo's past. He raises Yugo for 12 years, training him as an assistant chef at the inn's restaurant, until the day their hometown comes under attack by a mysterious enemy and Yugo's past must be revealed.

;Cleophee ('''Cleome''' in the English dub)
:''Voiced by'': Maryne Bretieaux (French); [[Joanna Ruiz]] (English)&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
:Evangelyne's younger sister. She is a [[tomboy]] and more easy going than her older sister. She was in the Cra military and is a skilled fighter who works well with Percedal in hand to hand combat, which seems to make Evangelyne worried that Percedal might like Cleophee more than her. After the battle on the Crimson Claws, she sailed back home to Cra City with Elaine and Black Ink.

;Grougaloragran 
:''Voiced by'': [[Benoit Allemane]] (French); Tom Clarke-Hill (English)
:A mysterious old man who cares for the infantile Yugo and later must hide him from the dangerous Nox. He is incredibly strong with the ability to breathe fire. Nox on their first battle stated he was a dragon, where in episode 17 it is revealed he is a powerful dragon in human form.

Apart from this, the First Born are shown to be capable of immense power and judging by the special episodes, aged at a far slower rate than their peers.

;Nox 
:''Voiced by'': Benjamin Pascal (French); [[Arthur Bostrom]] &lt;small&gt;''(Season 1)''&lt;/small&gt;, [[Kaiji Tang]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite tweet|user=KaijiTang|author=Kaiji Tang|number=980291413953974272|title=Are you a fan of #Wakfu? The Season 3 English Dub is hitting Netflix this week ( though it's totally already out on the French Netflix )! Honored to provide the new voice of Nox and the voice of Black Bump!

:The main villain of the first season. A [[Dofus#Characters classes|Xelor]] with twisted and obsessive motives. At the beginning of season one, he encounters Grougaloragran in the guise of a human and is initially surprised by his high levels of Wakfu, Nox is swiftly immobilized and has since been searching for Grougaloragran on his travels, as well as any other large sources of Wakfu to absorb. Nox quickly proves to be a dangerous enemy and often speaks with an insane-sounding giggle at the end of each sentence. It is revealed early on that he needs a large quantity of Wakfu for an item known as the Eliacube, which in his insanity, he believes is alive, and that it speaks to him. He plans to use the Wakfu to go back in time and undo a great wrong that he has done, where because of this he sees everything he does at this present time as reversible and doesn't hesitate to kill anyone in his way, eventually going after the Tree of Life; however, killing the Tree of Life, would effectively wipe out the entire Sadida race as They share the same life-force as the Tree. He appears to have had a family at one time, as evidenced by his constant mention of them. In the end, despite absorbing Wakfu for over 200 years he was only able to go back 20 minutes in time; and upon discovering this he falls to his knees and grieves at the fact he will never be able to save his family. His last words are a farewell to Yugo before teleporting away...No longer supported by the Eliacube, or Nox's will to live, his body withers and turns to dust by his family's grave. 
:His past was revealed in a special episode, where he used to be a kind well muscular father figure named '''Noximilien Coxen''' with a flair for inventing and great skills as a [[Horologist]]. He was a good father and loved his wife and children more than anything, but was depressed at the fact he could not provide financially for his family, often having to negotiate with a man over his debt. While playing with his family on the beach, Igol runs away and discovers the cave that held the Eliacube. Noximilien takes it to his workshop and tinkers with it, amazed at the possibilities the device has, he becomes obsessed with researching the cube to the point of abandoning everything else. His health deteriorates and he hints that he [[insomnia|no longer sleeps]]; these serve to degrade his body to a skeletal state. His family also leaves him; by the time he leaves his workshop to present his work to his wife, his home is shown to be barren and dilapidated, and a note shows that his wife has moved to live with her sister, telling him to come join them if he's ever ready. Before he receives the chance, he is told they have perished in a flood in their new home. In a desperate state, he plunges deeper into his research, seeking a means to turn back time and correct his mistake. This obsession drives him increasingly insane, eventually creating the main antagonist seen in the Wakfu series. With his past revealed, becomes more of a [[sympathetic villain]].
:He and season 2 villain Qilby return in Season 3 as a phantom that torments Yugo psyche.

:;Marama, Frisco, and Tartufo (I, II and III)
::Three of Nox's minions, which he refers to as his "favorites." They are first seen during his fight with Grougaloragran and...although their exact nature is unknown, they appear to be a mummified [[Dofus#Characters classes|Cra, Feca, and Sacrier]], and possess most of those classes' respective powers. They are all destroyed in the final battle. Defeated by Adamaï and Yugo, Marama is finally destroyed by Raze-time; Frisco and Tartufo are destroyed by Amalia.

:;Weedkilios
::Nox's minion, and a [[Dofus#Characters classes|Sadida]] analog to I, II, and III. His appearance is very different, being that of a dead and decayed [[Dofus#Characters classes|Sadida]]. His eyes are sunken and lifeless, his limbs are [[emaciated]], and his upper body appears to be supported only by a black, spine-like structure. Much of his apparent bulk seems to come from his wood armor. he is frozen by Evangelyne and destroyed by Amalia.

:;XII Raze-time
::Appears to be a large, boxy clockwork robot created by Nox, and one of his most powerful weapons. Before being confronted by the main characters, it devastated a large section of the [[Dofus#Characters classes|Sadidas]]' forest with its "stasis blasts." He was deactivated for good when Nox's clock is destroyed.

:;Igole
::A [[hyena]]-like Bow Wow (species of dog in that world) that served Nox. Igole can travel at extremely fast speeds (most likely given to him by his control collar) and has the ability to run on water to get from island to island when traveling over-sea. He can also inhale so deeply that he creates a vacuum. It is revealed Igole was previously a pet owned by a little girl who is later revealed to have been Nox's daughter, who drowned due to Ogrest's tears along with the rest of his family. A little Osamodas girl named Lotie that resembled her caused Igole to change his ways, and soon he was freed from Nox's control and now lives with her. She also calls him Crazy-Eyes. In the prequel, he was drawn as a dog. This is because Igole is a Bow Wow by species, a type of dog analog in the Wakfu universe.

;Qilby
:''Voiced by'': Erik Colin &lt;small&gt;''(Season 2)''&lt;/small&gt;, Laurent Morteau &lt;small&gt;''(Season 3)''&lt;/small&gt; (French); [[Arthur Bostrom]] &lt;small&gt;''(Season 2)''&lt;/small&gt;, Joseph Whimms &lt;small&gt;''(Season 3)''&lt;/small&gt; (English)
: Qilby is the main antagonist of season two and the central villain of the series overall. He was accidentally summoned from the blank dimension when Yugo tried to harness the power of the Eliacube, when he comes to the world of Twelve he explains the origins of his species (through half-truths) and sends Yugo on a quest to acquire the Dofus (dragon egg) of his sister dragon, Shinonome. His true plan is eventually revealed – that the quest was large to distract Yugo so he could regain his power, steal back the Eliacube and then absorb the Wakfu of the planet to power his ship so he can continue to explore the Krozmos (the process would destroy the planet). He is finally defeated by Yugo, Elatrops children, and Shinonome (who refuses to help brother's foolish. Yugo sends him back in the blank dimension. While originally quiet, friendly and softspoken his personality changes drastically when he fuses with the Eliacube becoming cruel, sadistic, maniacal and manipulative. 

:It is unknown whether this is a result of the Eliacube warping his personality or if it is his true colors. The true source of his madness was his gift/curse: his eternal memory. No matter how many times he's reborn, he always remembers. This leads him to begin driven mad by boredom since there was nothing left to learn. Also, another source of his madness was his fear of being alone, which led to his actions that started the Mechanism war, forcing the Eliatropes to abandon their old homeworld. 

:He has all the same Powers as Yugo though many of them are more advanced versions, as well as an assortment of other Wakfu abilities, he also has full knowledge of the Eliacube and its workings (Nox spent 200 years just trying to figure out how to work it) makes him even more dangerous than Nox, he is also able to remember his past lives which are unique to his species and implied to be the source of his knowledge and madness, which he later stated was a curse. He is unquestionably the most powerful and dangerous villain in the series so far, with the possible exception of Rushu and Oropo. He and Season 1 villain Nox return as phantoms to torture Yugo.

====ShuShus'====
;Rushu
:''Voiced by'': [[Marc Alfos]] (French); Hugo Chandor (English)
:The tyrannical king of all Shushus. A 10-meter tall fiery demon, he is from another world, one that has mostly been destroyed down to rock and ash. He is looking for a way to enter the World of Twelve, so full of light and life, that he and his demons can keep destroying things. His powers are said to be equal to that of a god and include, super strength, pyrokinesis, telekinesis, and others as well. In the season 2 finale, his true form was revealed to be a grayish black humanoid with a single eye (it was said his fiery form is just for show). During the battle of Crimson Claws archipelago, he was sent back to the ShuShu realm.

;Anathar
:''Voiced by'': Antoine Tome (French); Joe Mills (English)
:A Shushu with the power to copy the ability of anyone he touches. Originally a bound shushu, he was released by his guardian and refused to be unsummoned. After being freed by the Brotherhood of Tofu, Remington releases him to distract the heroes; he quickly realizes this is a bad idea. Yugo uses his portal magic to attack Anathar, which he is then able to use much more powerfully than Yugo, such as generating a hundred portals at once. He is so powerful, he even opened up a portal into the Shushu realm. Through his actions, it would seem this power has a time limit for how long he can use it. He participates in the final battle in possing Adamaï against Yugo, but he is betrayed and threatened of destruction by Qilby, he decides to leave him to take care of Adamai and Yugo, Qilby accepts and spares Anathar. His final fate is unknown, he is presumed killed by Qilby when he tried to kill him for having insulted but it is possible that he is escaped and hid somewhere. Anathar and Ombrage are the only Shushus who did not return to ShuShu realm.

;Ombrage ('''Shadowfang''' in the English dub)
:''Voiced by'': Malvina Germain (French)
:A Shushu imprisoned in a ring, she has the power to steal a person's shadow, which appears to represent the target's soul, and turns them into a ghoul. However, she is unable to do this if the target lacks any darkness in their heart. She is first met in a ruined town, where she has taken over her guardian's spirit, who goes by the name Vampyro. After being defeated, her guardian swears never to fall for her tricks again. She returns in season 2 as an ally of Rubilax. Once Percedal is returned to his body, though, she is left behind, ignored by her guardian. In the closing scenes, however, an unknown figure picks her up. Ombrage and Anathar are the only Shushus who did not return to ShuShu realm.

====The Brotherhood of the Forgotten/The Siblings====
The main antagonists of season 3. A secret Guild where all the members are demigods or children of Dragons, thus they are semi-immortal. Their stated goal is to replace their parents and become the new gods of the World of Twelve, believing that the gods don't care about them and that the world has become horribly corrupt under their rule. They threw down the gauntlet against the Brotherhood of Tofu in Season 3 because their leader, Oropo, desires both the Percedal family children and Ruel to join their new pantheon. Furthermore, he has an unspecified need for Yugo's help as well in his plan. To that end, he is using the weaknesses and doubts in the characters to try to bring them to his side. However, later episodes reveal that not everyone in The Siblings fully trusts their leader and some begin to move on their own.

;Oropo
:''Voiced by'': Franck Lorrain (French); [[Christopher Corey Smith]] (English)
:The mysterious leader who appears in a large cloak with an owl-like mask. Oropo believed that the current gods are lazy and selfish, and want them to be replaced by The Siblings. Oropo is very calm and persuasive individual able to win others to his side with these traits. He claims to hate violence and chaos and is lenient on others despite what he considers flaws in their personalities. He also follows the principles of the end justifies the means and that sacrifice is necessary for change. He refers to himself as a non-existence.

:At the end of season 3 where he is revealed to be the last of the Eliotropes, a shadow-clone race accidentally created by Yugo in his image before he fought Ogrest. Once his identity is revealed, he shows a dark version side of himself. He identifies the same traits in Yugo and longs to replace him and be the "real" Yugo. Despite wanting to save the world, his ultimate plan still involves destroying all life on the planet, to eliminate the prayers going to the gods, making them vanish. He had no qualms about lying, using, or manipulating others and excused his actions or hypocritically shifted blame onto someone else. His actions, his reasons, and his extremes make Oropo no better than the gods he wishes to destroy. 

:Deep down, Oropo knows his actions and reasons for doing them are wrong and selfish, and he truly loved the Siblings, considering them his family, and he had been in love with Echo. His greatest flaw had been his obsession with becoming the "real Yugo", to take Yugo's place, and joining the Brotherhood of the Tofu, whom he saw as family because of the feelings and memories he'd inherited from Yugo that blinded him to the love and devotion of Echo and his friends until it was too late.

:Oropo is extremely powerful, able to bend time and space in the creation of his multi-dimensional tower of dreams. Furthermore, he has somehow gained possession of the Eliacube which can make its user as strong as a god. He is also able to enter people's minds through the cracks of their doubts and fears. When his people, the Eliotrope, dies, their Wakfu would transfer into Oropo, making him hold all the Wakfu of his once dead race.

He promises Eva that he won't trick her if she saves him, however, when he gets to the ledge, he tries to kill her with a sword Shushu. Eva dodges the attack, and Remington ends up destroying the ledge he was hanging onto and plummets to his apparent death. However, it is revealed that he did survive the fall in Episode 8 of Season 2. He meets Eva again in a prison where he releases an extremely powerful Shushu named Anathar.

'''Whuffie''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|hw|ʌ|f|i}} is the ephemeral, reputation-based [[currency]] of [[Cory Doctorow]]'s science fiction novel ''[[Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom]]'' and his short story "Truncat".&lt;ref&gt;Cory Doctorow on salon.com: [http://www.salon.com/2003/08/26/truncat/ ''Truncat'', Aug 26, 2003], retrieved 17 January 2014&lt;/ref&gt; This book describes a [[post scarcity|post-scarcity economy]]: all the necessities (and most of the luxuries) of life are free for the taking. A person's current Whuffie is instantly viewable to anyone, as everybody has a [[brain implant]] giving them an interface with the Net.

The term has since seen some adoption as a synonym for [[social capital]], including its use in the title of the [[Tara Hunt]] book ''The Whuffie Factor''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/lydiadishman/2013/09/28/why-ashton-kutcher-couldnt-save-this-stylish-startup/|title=Why Ashton Kutcher Couldn't Save This Stylish Startup|author=Lydia Dishman|date=28 September 2013|work=Forbes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, Doctorow stated that Whuffie "would make a terrible currency."&lt;ref name=terrible&gt;[http://www.locusmag.com/Perspectives/2016/03/cory-doctorow-wealth-inequality-is-even-worse-in-reputation-economies/ Cory Doctorow: Wealth Inequality Is Even Worse in Reputation Economies], by [[Cory Doctorow]], in ''[[Locus (magazine)|Locus]]''; published March 3, 2016; retrieved March 10, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

== Explanation ==
In the novel ''Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom'', industrial-era economic constraints and scarcity-management regimes have been made obsolete by technology: Whuffie has replaced [[money]],  providing an esteem- and admiration-rewarding motivation for people to do useful and creative things.  A person's Whuffie is a general measurement of his or her overall reputation and is gained (or lost) according to a person's favorable (or unfavorable) actions.  Public opinion determines which actions are favorable or unfavorable. The Whuffie of one who rudely pushes past others may suffer, as she incurs the disapprobation of those pushed, or witnesses of the event. A much-loved symphony, on the other hand, continues to earn the composer Whuffie as more people enjoy it. Some judgments contributing to an individual's Whuffie are automatic and require no conscious thought on the part of others, as all possess brain chips. As brain dumps allow machines to carry consciousness, the machines can do the thinking for people and allow them to know the results automatically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Richard Koman|author2=Cory Doctorow |date=2003-02-27|title=Cory Doctorow's Bitchun' World: P2P Gone Wild|url=http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/policy/2003/02/24/perspectives.html|publisher=O'Reilly Network|accessdate=2006-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two different methods are explained as being right-hand (the amount you directly attribute to an action) and left-hand (an aggregate of the right-hand Whuffie of the people who have given you left-hand).

Example: A person gave me 50 right-hand (direct) Whuffie for a song I wrote, that they like. I also received 100 left-hand Whuffie from the people that that person has also given right-hand Whuffie to (indirect).

While there are few details in the novel of how this system actually works, it is described in idealistic terms:
:"Whuffie recaptured the true essence of money: in the old days, if you were broke but respected, you wouldn't starve; contrariwise, if you were rich and hated, no sum could buy you security and peace. By measuring the thing that money really represented—your personal capital with your friends and neighbors—you more accurately gauged your success".

A person with a score of 0 is just as capable of giving and revoking Whuffie as someone with a score of 1,000,000. The person with the million-point score would be invited to parties and elite events while his bottomed-out counterpart would probably not even be allowed into reputable clubs or restaurants; but both of their opinions on someone else would count for the same amount of gross Whuffie.

Like all economic systems, Whuffie has effects that seem undesirable to many. It might tend to favour popular speech at the expense of public discourse, and it could frequently be uninformative: if a person has a high Whuffie score, is it for guitar playing or auto repair?  However, both of these are already the status quo under a money economy, and the concept of weighted Whuffie helps make better decisions on a person-by-person basis, and thus is more flexible than rating someone by their bank account. Also, the Whuffie system (in the book) keeps a public history of how each person's Whuffie was earned, unlike the secret origins of many people's money.

== Similarities to other stories ==
* [[Howard L. Myers]] wrote of a similar system based on admiration in his story "All Around the Universe", written between 1967 and 1971.
* [[Iain M. Banks]] uses a similar currency system for the Nasqueron Dwellers based on "Kudos" in his novel ''[[The Algebraist]]''.
* [[Jack Vance]] uses a reputation system called "strakh" as currency in his short story ''[[The Moon Moth]]'', published in 1961.
* In [[Daniel Suarez (author)|Daniel Suarez]]' second novel of the [[Daemon (novel series)|Daemon series]], [[Freedom™]], members of the "Darknet", a shared [[overlay network]] and [[augmented reality]], have social rankings derived by ratings from their peers, which are intended to reflect a members contribution to the Darknet society.
* [[Luke Crane]] and [[Jared A. Sorensen]] [[Role-playing game|RPG]] [[Freemarket RPG|Freemarket]] has a similar society centered on a reputation-based economy in which the basic needs of all—sustenance and shelter—are accounted for.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://rpggeek.com/rpgitem/73343/freemarket-limited-edition|title=FreeMarket (Limited Edition)|website=RPGGeek}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The ''[[Black Mirror]]'' episode "[[Nosedive (Black Mirror)|Nosedive]]" is set in a world where people can rate each other from one to five stars for every interaction they have, which can impact their socioeconomic status.

== The Whuffie Bank ==

The [[Whuffie Bank]] launched as a non-profit company at the [[TechCrunch50]] conference on September 15, 2009. The organization aims to create a reputation currency for social networks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://techcrunch.com/2009/09/15/tc50-meet-the-whuffie-a-new-currency-thats-based-on-your-online-reputation/ |title=TC50: Meet The Whuffie, A New Currency That's Based On Your Online Reputation |author=Jason Kincaid |date=September 15, 2009 |work=TechCrunch}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, their URL and Twitter feed became inactive on April 2012. As of December 2013 the website is inaccessible and relays the message "No more Whuffies :'(."&lt;ref&gt;http://thewhuffiebank.org/  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091004045850/http://thewhuffiebank.org/ |date=October 4, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In use ==

The [[science fiction]] convention [[Penguicon]] is known for compensating its volunteers for their time using Whuffies.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://io9.com/354128/a-handy-currency-converter-for-alien-money A Handy Currency Converter For Alien Money]'', iO9&lt;/ref&gt; It can be traded in for T-shirts, a place to sleep overnight, or a refunded convention membership.

== Etymology ==
Doctorow has indicated that the word ''Whuffie'' is a made-up word he used in high school, and is not a vocalization of an abbreviation (in the style of 'Gazoo'&amp;nbsp;– GSU, or Grad Students Union) or of [[Wi-Fi]] as is often believed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Cory Doctorow|date=2003-01-14|title=Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom Frequently Asked Questions, Part 1|url=http://www.craphound.com/down/000263.html|accessdate=2006-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whuffie is mentioned in Doctorow's ''[[Eastern Standard Tribe]]'', but appears to be in the general sense of building reputation.
