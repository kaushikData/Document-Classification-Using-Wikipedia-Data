"'''A Rugrats Passover'''" is the 26th and final episode of the third season of the American [[animated television series]] ''[[Rugrats]]'', and its 65th episode overall. It was broadcast originally on April 13, 1995, on the cable network [[Nickelodeon (TV channel)|Nickelodeon]]. The plot follows series regulars [[List of Rugrats characters#Adults|Grandpa Boris]] and the babies as they become trapped in the attic on [[Passover]]; to pass the time, Boris tells the [[Jewish]] story of [[the Exodus]]. During the episode the babies themselves reenact the story, with young [[Tommy Pickles|Tommy]] portraying [[Moses]], while his cousin [[Angelica Pickles|Angelica]] represents the [[Pharaoh of Egypt]].

"A Rugrats Passover" was directed by Jim Duffy, Steve Socki, and Jeff McGrath from the script by [[Peter Gaffney]], [[Paul Germain]], Rachel Lipman, and Jonathon Greenberg. The episode was conceived in 1992 when Germain responded to a Nickelodeon request for a ''Rugrats'' [[Hanukkah]] special by creating a Passover episode instead. The episode scored a 3.1 [[Nielsen Rating]], making it "the highest-rated show in Nickelodeon's history",&lt;ref name="ratings"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Nickelodeon on a roll; Learning Station's bright idea|date=1995-10-14|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|page=66}}&lt;/ref&gt; and received overwhelmingly positive reviews, including from Jewish community publications. It was nominated for a [[Primetime Emmy Award]], an [[Annie Award]], and a [[CableACE Award]]. The episode also, however, attracted controversy, when the [[Anti-Defamation League]] compared the artistic design of the older characters to [[Antisemitism|anti-Semitic]] drawings from a 1930s [[Nazism|Nazi]] newspaper.

The episode made ''Rugrats'' one of the first animated series to focus on a Jewish holiday; its success precipitated the creation of another special, "[[A Rugrats Chanukah]]", which also attracted critical acclaim. A novelization of the episode was in 2007 exhibited at the [[Sherwin Miller Museum of Jewish Art]] in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]].

==Plot==
As the episode opens, Tommy and Angelica Pickles and their parents are all gathering to celebrate the [[Passover Seder]] at the home of Didi's parents, Boris and Minka Kropotkin. Stu and Angelica, who are Christians, both find Passover boring, and Angelica argues why she and her parents should be at the Seder at all, especially considering Boris and Minka aren't actually related to them. Following an argument with Minka about what type of wine glasses they should use (either the glasses that belonged to Minka's mother or the ones that belonged to Boris' father), Boris storms out of the room; the two families arrive and Didi tries comforting her mom, who believes Boris has run away.

Boris hasn't reappeared by the time Tommy's best friend, Chuckie Finster, and his dad, Chas, arrive to join the celebration; when the Seder begins the children set off to search for toys, eventually finding Boris in the attic. Boris explains that he felt bad about yelling at Minka, and had gone to look for her mother's wine glasses, but had become locked inside when the door closed behind him (it can't open from the inside). Angelica tests the door, and inadvertently locks them all in again.

Angelica tells Boris that he's not really missing anything and admits that she thinks that Passover's a dumb holiday. Boris tries convincing her otherwise by telling her and the boys the story of [[the Exodus]], hoping to improve their understanding of Passover. As he talks, Angelica imagines herself as the [[Pharaoh]] of [[Egypt]], who commands the [[Hebrew]] [[Slavery|slaves]] (imagined as the other Rugrats and numerous other babies) to throw their newborn sons into the [[Nile River]]. [[Jochebed|One Hebrew slave]] defies the order by putting her infant son, [[Moses]] (imagined as Tommy), into a basket and setting the basket afloat in the river. The basket and baby are discovered by Pharaoh Angelica, who shows Moses around her palace and kingdom, and decides to make him her partner.

As Boris explains that the Pharaoh was oblivious that Moses himself was actually a Hebrew, Chas enters the attic, looking for the kids, and becomes locked in with the rest of them. He sits down and listens as Boris continues: years later, Boris says, Moses stood up for an abused Hebrew slave (imagined as Chuckie), and was outed as a Hebrew. The episode then pictures Tommy as Moses fleeing to the desert, where he becomes a shepherd and forgets about Egypt and the Pharaoh, until the voice of [[God]] calls to him from a burning bush, telling him that he must free the Hebrews from slavery.

Moses confronts the Pharaoh and demands that she free the Hebrews. She refuses and calls her guards (one of which was a kid named Justin, voiced by [[Dana Hill]]) to drag Moses away; he curses her kingdom with [[Plagues of Egypt|terrible plagues]] until she relents and allows Moses to leave with the enslaved Hebrews. As Boris is explaining how the Pharaoh deceived the Hebrews and prevented them from leaving, Angelica's parents, Drew and Charlotte, arrive and become locked in with the others.

Boris resumes the story: the Pharaoh's treachery causes Moses to curse her once more, this time with a plague on the first-born children of Egypt. The Pharaoh, after realizing that she herself is a first-born child, bargains with Moses: he can leave if he calls off this final plague. Moses hesitates at first, but complies and leads the Hebrews out of Egypt. The Pharaoh reneges on her promise (after realizing that she set '''''all''''' of the Hebrews free) and leads out her remaining army to pursue them.

Minka, Didi, and Stu arrive in the attic to find the group enthralled by the end of Boris' story: Moses, cornered, calls down the power of God to part the [[Red Sea]], which the Hebrews are approaching. They pass through the parted waters, which then crash back together behind them, engulfing the Pharaoh and her army. With the story over, the family gets up to finish the Seder only to see the wind blow the door shut, locking them all in. Boris decides to tell them another story, which Chas at first thinks is about how the Hebrews wandered the desert for forty years before finally reaching the Promised Land. Boris explains that it's actually a story about how an aunt and uncle of his met at Passover Seder back in [[Russia]].

The episode's inception in 1992 followed a call by [[Nickelodeon]] to the ''Rugrats'' production staff, [[pitch (filmmaking)|pitching]] the concept of a special episode concerning [[Hanukkah]].&lt;ref name="yorker"&gt;{{cite news|title=How raising the Rugrats children became as difficult as the real thing|author =Swartz, Mimi|date=1998-10-30|work=[[The New Yorker]]|page=62}}&lt;/ref&gt; The crew agreed instead that a Passover special would offer both "historical interest" and a "funny idea", so [[Paul Germain]]—founder of the series along with [[Arlene Klasky]] and [[Gábor Csupó]]—pitched the Passover idea instead.&lt;ref name="yorker"/&gt;&lt;ref name="four"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Four questions for creator of 'Rugrats': Cartoon series offers a Passover plot for the younger set|author =Elkin, Michael|date=1995-04-14|work=[[Jewish Exponent]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Germain wrote the episode's teleplay along with regular ''Rugrats'' writers [[Peter Gaffney]], Rachel Lipman, and Jonathon Greenberg; animators Jim Duffy, Steve Socki, and Jeff McGrath directed.&lt;ref name="main"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cooltoons2.com/rugrats/ |title=Rugrats → Episode Guide → Specials → More → Rugrats Passover |accessdate=2009-10-25 |publisher=[[Klasky Csupo]] |format=[[Adobe Flash]] page |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100109081344/http://www.cooltoons2.com/rugrats/ |archivedate=2010-01-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite new|title='Rugrats' Observes Passover|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=1995-04-13|author =O'Connor, John J.|page=16|location=[[New York City|New York]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; While scripting the episode, now entitled "A Rugrats Passover", the writers were forced to audit many elements of the portrayal of [[Plagues of Egypt|plagues]], particularly the third one, so it could still be accessible to children and not too frightening.&lt;ref name="free"&gt;{{cite news|title='Rugrats' holiday special is designed to entertain, inform|work=[[The Free Lance Star]]|date=1995-04-13|author =Prescott, Jean|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though regular episodes of the series comprised two separate 15-minute segments, "A Rugrats Passover" had a special 22-minute format, occupying the show's full network ''Rugrats'' slot.&lt;ref name="four"/&gt; The show's voice actors each spent from fifteen minutes to four hours in [[recording session]]s for the episode.&lt;ref name="awn"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.awn.com/mag/issue2.12/2.12pages/2.12soucievoice.html|title=And I Get Paid!?!: The Life of a Voice Actor|date=March 1998|accessdate=2010-01-06|work=[[Animation World Magazine]]|author =[[Kath Soucie|Soucie, Kath]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.egdaily.com/voice1.html |title=Rugrat's Tommy |accessdate=2010-01-06 |publisher=Official Site of E.G.

==Themes==
"A Rugrats Passover" was unusual among contemporary animations in its attention to [[Judaism|Jewish]] ritual and tradition.&lt;ref name="main"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;&lt;ref name="family"/&gt; Its portrayal of a Seder dinner received press attention as a rare occurrence in children's programming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='A Rugrats Passover'|work=[[The Washington Post]]|author =Moore, Scott|date=1995-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The episode was also unusual among animated series for discussing the characters' religious affiliations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A Rugrats Passover|work=[[The Atlanta Journal]]/[[The Atlanta Constitution]]|author =Kloer, Phil|date=1995-04-10|page=A/3}}&lt;/ref&gt; It revealed Boris, Minka, and Didi's adherence to Judaism, and compared it with the relative non-participation of Stu and his side of the family. Chuckie and his father Chas, meanwhile, were portrayed as nonreligious yet inclusive and enthused to learn about the customs of the holiday.&lt;ref name="timeline"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cooltoons2.com/agu/history.html |title=Rugrats Timeline |publisher=[[Klasky Csupo]] |accessdate=2009-10-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090609185301/http://www.cooltoons2.com/agu/history.html |archivedate=2009-06-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As with other ''Rugrats'' episodes, "A Rugrats Passover" depicts "the innocence of a baby's perception of the world," emphasizing the young characters' intense, childlike reactions to their environment.&lt;ref name="ledger"&gt;{{cite news|title=The powerful appeal of Rugrats: Cable TV's top children's show relays comforting values|work=[[The Ledger]]|author =Loftus, Mary J.|date=1996-11-26|page=D6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Creator Klasky identified the episode's depiction of the Pickles family as "very loving, [and] basically functional"&lt;ref name="ledger"/&gt; as strikingly different from the prevailing trends in contemporary television programming.&lt;ref name="ledger"/&gt; Another episode element common to the series' broader themes is its treatment of Angelica's mother Charlotte, who throughout the episode is glued to her cell phone and engrossed in her business life, despite her professed desire to provide Angelica with an educational environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Rugrats' Real Mom and Dad|work=[[BusinessWeek]]|date=1995-10-16|pages=143–144}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
===Ratings and accolades===

===Critical response===
"A Rugrats Passover" received overwhelmingly positive reviews and became one of the series' all-time most popular episodes.&lt;ref name="half"&gt;{{cite book|title=The half-Jewish book: a celebration|author1=Klein, Daniel |author2=Vuijst, Freke |publisher=Villard|year=2000|isbn=0-375-50385-4|page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; John J. O'Connor of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote of the episode "If not a first, it certainly is a rarity."&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt; Ted Cox of the ''[[Daily Herald (Arlington Heights)|Daily Herald]]'' called the episode "among the best holiday TV specials ever produced."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Seasonal all-stars The 12 top TV specials of Christmas – and other winter holidays.|author =Cox, Ted|date=2005-12-01|work=[[Daily Herald (Arlington Heights)|Daily Herald]]|location=[[Arlington Heights, Illinois]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other reviews applauded the episode for its treatment of Judaism. Authors Michael Atkinson and Laurel Shifrin, in their book ''Flickipedia: Perfect Films for Every Occasion, Holiday, Mood, Ordeal, and Whim'' praised the episode for celebrating "secular Jewishness in the wisest and most entertaining fashion&amp;nbsp;[...]&amp;nbsp;Grandpa Boris regales the kids with an epic, albeit abridged, Exodus story."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Flickipedia: Perfect Films for Every Occasion, Holiday, Mood, Ordeal, and Whim|author1=Atkinson, Michael |author2=Shifrin, Laurel |page=34|publisher=Chicago Review Press|isbn=1-55652-714-4|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Halley Blair of ''[[Forward Magazine]]'' called the episode "a comical primer for getting children ready for upcoming seders,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Rugrats Animate 'The Greatest Holiday'|work=[[Forward Magazine]]|date=1995-04-14|author =Blair, Halley}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Danny Goldberg, in ''How The Left Lost Teen Spirit,'' noted that the episode's Jewish themes were "clearly expressed in the context of a mass appeal entertainment."&lt;ref name="controversy"/&gt; Among many positive reviews of the episode in Jewish community publications, Gila Wertheimer of the ''[[Chicago Jewish Star]]'' said that the episode "will entertain children of all ages – and their parents."&lt;ref name="star"/&gt;

Joel Keller of [[AOL]]'s [[TV Squad]], on the other hand, noted in 2006 that he "always hated" the episode, and resented that it was one of only two Passover-themed television episodes he could find via a [[Google]] search.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvsquad.com/2006/04/12/why-dont-more-shows-do-passover-episodes/|title=Why don't more shows do Passover episodes?|publisher=[[TV Squad]] ([[AOL]])|accessdate=2010-01-06|author =Keller, Joel|date=2006-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anti-Defamation League controversy===
"A Rugrats Passover," along with other ''Rugrats'' episodes featuring Boris and Minka, attracted controversy when the [[Anti-Defamation League]] (ADL) claimed that the two characters resembled [[Antisemitism|anti-Semitic]] drawings that had appeared in a 1930s [[Nazism|Nazi]] newspaper. [[Nickelodeon (TV channel)|Nickelodeon]]'s then-president [[Albie Hecht]], himself Jewish, professed himself dumbfounded by the criticism, calling it absurd.&lt;ref name="controversy"&gt;{{cite book|title=How The Left Lost Teen Spirit|author =Goldberg, Danny|year=2005|publisher=Akashic Books|page=216|isbn=0-9719206-8-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The controversy resurfaced in 1998 when the ADL criticized another appearance of Boris, this time reciting the [[Mourner's Kaddish]] in a ''Rugrats'' comic strip published in newspapers during the [[Jewish New Year]]. Unlike Hecht, Nickelodeon's new president [[Herb Scannell]] agreed with the criticism and apologized, promising never to run the character or the strip again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.awn.com/mag/issue3.9/3.9pages/3.9business.html|title=Rugrats Offends Media Watchdogs|work=[[Animation World Magazine]]|author1=Jackson, Wendy |author2=Amidi, Amid |date=December 1998|accessdate=2009-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Andre Garcia''' is a [[Luxury good|luxury]] [[cigar case]] [[brand]] name. The company is [[Privately held company|privately held]] and has offices in U.S and India.

==History==

Andre Garcia is a luxury cigar case brand started in 2003 by Abhik Roy from [[Calcutta]] [[India]]. Until the creation of the Andre Garcia line in 2003, Roy and his [[artisans]] toiled in relative anonymity, making cases that carried the brand names of other companies in its factory in Calcutta, India. Roy was the first to introduce a wide variety and style in cigar cases in an otherwise stagnant cigar case market.

Andre Garcia brand's guiding principle was "one size does not fit all". Roy pioneered a spectrum of sizes to accommodate anything from a short trip, for which one might like a solo smoke, to a party, at which one intend to offer cigars to all the guys. Striving for multiplicity, Andre Garcia crafted 1—, 2—, 4—, 5—, 6—, 8—, 10—, 16— and 20—finger cases in various designs, [[leather]] grains, dimensions and colors, as well as widths and lengths.
As an alternative to typical leather case, from which the top simply slides off the company launched a unique zipper—enclosed top ([[patent pending]]) [[cigar case]].

The brand gained popularity only in recent years and received press coverage in several leading cigar journals such as European Cult, [[Cigar Aficionado]], [[Robb Report]], Vintage Luxe, Smoke etc.

In present day, the company produces cigar cases and leather accessories under its private label and also produces cases for other brands.

'''''Baby Island''''' is a children's novel by [[Carol Ryrie Brink]], first published in 1937. It resembles ''[[Robinson Crusoe]]'' in that the protagonists Mary and Jean are stranded on a [[desert island]] – but with four babies. The novel was republished many times over the next several decades.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldcat.org/title/baby-island/oclc/299198/editions ''Editions of ''Baby Island''] at [[WorldCat]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot summary==
The book begins with the Wallace sisters, twelve-year-old Mary and ten-year-old Jean, traveling alone on a ship to meet their father in Australia. The girls often [[babysit]] young children: at home, they had enjoyed "borrowing" the babies of neighbors.

Their ship is disabled in a storm, and the two girls are set adrift in a lifeboat with four babies, the children of fellow passengers. The craft eventually drifts to a tropical island, and in a [[Robinsonade|Robinson Crusoe-like scenario]], they must learn to build shelter and survive on wild foodstuffs. They do this with great success, while raising the babies through various [[developmental milestones]] and adopting a baby monkey who they raise alongside the babies.

Throughout the story, the girls sing "[[Scots Wha Hae]]" to inspire their courage to deal with their situation.

In the latter part of the book the girls also encounter a character like [[Friday (Robinson Crusoe)|Friday]]: a mysterious, gruff man who lives alone on the island and dislikes children. He eventually warms to their babies, and they enjoy his company and his useful craftsmanship.

Finally, the girls are rescued on Christmas Day, after a storm, and all the babies are returned to their parents. They miss the Friday.

The {{nihongo|'''cherry blossom front'''|桜前線|sakura zensen}} refers to the advance of the [[cherry blossoms]] across [[Japan]]. The [[Japan Meteorological Agency]] records the opening and full bloom of the blossoms from [[Kyūshū]] in late March to [[Hokkaidō]] in the middle of May. The advancing front is also the subject of regular reports by the major [[Japanese newspapers|news agencies]]. The cherry blossom is of great public interest in Japan thanks to [[Cherry blossoms#Symbolism_in_Japan|its symbolism]] and the custom of [[Cherry blossoms#Flower viewing|flower viewing]] known as ''[[hanami]]''.

==Forecasts==
From 1951 the [[Japan Meteorological Agency]] produced forecasts for the [[Kantō region]] and from 1955 for the whole of Japan excepting [[Okinawa Prefecture|Okinawa]] and the [[Amami Islands]].&lt;ref name="method"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.data.jma.go.jp/sakura/data/cb/kaisetu24sakura.pdf |title=新しいサクラの開花予想 |publisher=[[Japan Meteorological Agency]] |accessdate=1 March 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130106160101/http://www.data.jma.go.jp/sakura/data/cb/kaisetu24sakura.pdf |archivedate=6 January 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; From 2010, the Agency left forecasting to the [[private sector]] although it continues to observe and determine the impact of the climate upon the flowering of the cherry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jma.go.jp/jma/press/0912/25a/091225sakura.pdf |title=気象庁におけるさくらの開花予想の発表終了について |publisher=[[Japan Meteorological Agency]] |date=25 December 2009 |accessdate=1 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Asahi"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.asahi.com/eco/TKY201103250234.html |title=桜の標本木、進む代替わり 老齢化で後進育成急ピッチ |date=25 March 2011 |accessdate=1 March 2012 |work=[[Asahi Shimbun]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The forecast is based on the [[Arrhenius equation]], with the formula 

:&lt;math&gt;\text{DTS} = \exp\left[9.5 \times 10^3 \cdot \frac{T - 288.2}{288.2T}\right],&lt;/math&gt;

where ''T'' is the mean day temperature in [[kelvin]]s, and DTS represents the number of days transformed to [[Standard conditions for temperature and pressure|standard temperature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.data.jma.go.jp/sakura/data/cb/sakura.html |title=さくら開花予想方法について |publisher=[[Japan Meteorological Agency]] |accessdate=1 March 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120506135823/http://www.data.jma.go.jp/sakura/data/cb/sakura.html |archivedate=6 May 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://ci.nii.ac.jp/naid/120001497252 |title=Climatological Studies on Blooming of Cherry Tree (Prunus yedoensis) by Means of DTS Method |language=Japanese, English |author=Aono Yasuyuki |journal=Bulletin of the University of Osaka Prefecture.

==Blossoming==
The day of opening&lt;ref group="note"&gt;[[Japanese language|Japanese terms]]: {{nihongo|day of opening|開花日}}; {{nihongo|day of full bloom|満開日}}; {{nihongo|sample tree|標本木}}; {{nihongo|cherry blossom forecast|さくらの開花予想}}&lt;/ref&gt; is defined as the point at which at least five to six flowers have opened on the sample tree. The day of full bloom is when at least 80% of the flowers have opened. The [[Yoshino cherry]] is typically observed since, from the late [[Edo period]], it has been planted across the [[Japanese archipelago|archipelago]].&lt;ref name="Cherry"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.data.jma.go.jp/sakura/data/sakura2010.pdf |title=さくらの開花日と満開日 |publisher=[[Japan Meteorological Agency]] |accessdate=1 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sample trees also include the [[Prunus subhirtella|Higan cherry]] in the south and ''[[Prunus sargentii]]'' (Sargent's cherry) in the north.&lt;ref name="Cherry"/&gt;

In 2006 it was reported that the cherry blossoms might overtake the [[plum blossoms]] before reaching Hokkaidō.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/japan/1515097/Cherries-winning-the-blossom-race.html |title=Cherries winning the blossom race |author=Joyce, Colin |date=7 April 2006 |accessdate=1 March 2012 |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sample trees==

There are fifty-nine sample trees at any one time. Successor junior trees are selected from among prospective candidates when an incumbent becomes too old or is otherwise incapacitated.&lt;ref name="Asahi"/&gt; For instance, the sample tree in [[Mito, Ibaraki|Mito]] collapsed under the weight of [[snow]] in 2005, while that at the southern tip of [[Ishigaki Island]] was felled by a [[typhoon]] a year later.&lt;ref name="Asahi"/&gt; The fifty-nine sample trees are located across Japan, corresponding to the sites of the Agency's principal [[weather stations]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.data.jma.go.jp/sakura/data/sakura2012_kaika.html |title=Cherry blossoms 2012 - day of opening |language=Japanese |publisher=[[Japan Meteorological Agency]] |accessdate=1 March 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308233449/http://www.data.jma.go.jp/sakura/data/sakura2012_kaika.html |archivedate=8 March 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jma.go.jp/jma/kishou/link/link1.html |title=Agency Weather Stations (気象台, 測候所) |publisher=[[Japan Meteorological Agency]] |accessdate=2 March 2012 |language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jma-net.go.jp/nagoya/hp/asl/oshirase/oshirase_090318.pdf |title=2009 revised forecast (Note 4. 気象台や測候所の定めた標本木) |publisher=[[Japan Meteorological Agency]] |accessdate=2 March 2012 |language=Japanese |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120420192028/http://www.jma-net.go.jp/nagoya/hp/asl/oshirase/oshirase_090318.pdf |archivedate=20 April 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:ChestOfDrawers.jpg|thumb|A chest on chest, a derivative of the simpler chest of drawers]]

A '''chest of drawers''', also called (especially in [[North American English]]) a '''bureau''', is a type of [[cabinet (furniture)|cabinet]] (a piece of [[furniture]]) that has multiple parallel, horizontal [[Drawer (furniture)|drawer]]s usually stacked one above another.

In [[American English]] a dresser is a piece of furniture, usually waist high, that has drawers and normally room for a mirror. In [[British English]] a dresser or a [[Welsh dresser]] has shelves in the upper section for storing or displaying [[tableware]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Collins English Dictionary|date=1986|publisher=William Collins Sons &amp; Co. Ltd.|isbn=0 00 433134-6|edition=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Chest (furniture)|Chest]]s of drawers have traditionally been made and used for storing [[clothing]], especially [[underwear]], socks, and other items not normally hung in or otherwise stored in a [[closet]]. They are usually placed in a [[bedroom]] for this purpose, but can actually be used to store anything that will fit inside and can be placed anywhere in a house or another place. Various personal sundry items are also often stored in a chest of drawers. It has a long history as one of the stand-bys of a [[carpentry|carpenter]]'s workshop. A typical chest is approximately rectangular in overall shape and often has short legs at the bottom corners for placement on the floor.

Chests of drawers often come in 5-, 6-, and 7-drawer varieties, with either a single or a double top drawer. The chest illustrated at right would be described as a '5 over 2 chest-on-chest', the latter term deriving from the fact that at one time it would have been made as 2 separable pieces. They are commonly made of [[wood]], similar to many other kinds of furniture, but of course can be made of other materials. The inside of the drawers can be accessed by pulling them out at the front side. It is often placed so that the back side faces a wall since access to the back is not necessary. The lateral sides are also usually made such that they can be placed against a wall or in a corner. Although they can be plain in appearance, chests of  drawers can also be made with a fancy or ornamental appearance, including finishes and various external color tones. Traditionally, drawers would slide out on smooth wood rails. Most modern cabinets (such as [[Filing cabinet]]s) use [[roll-out shelf]] sliders, made of metal,&lt;ref&gt; N. B. Dubey {{google books|3aiA1URwOXIC|Office Management: Developing Skills for Smooth Functioning|page=170}}&lt;/ref&gt; with rollers.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

Most chests of drawers fall into one of two types: those which are about waist-high or bench-high and those (usually with more drawers) which are about shoulder-high. Both types typically have a flat surface on top. Waist-high chests often have a [[mirror]] placed vertically on top, which is often bought with the piece. While a user is getting dressed or otherwise preparing their grooming, he or she can look at themselves in the mirror to check their appearance.

A ''[[chifforobe]]'' (from ''chiffo''nier + ward''robe'') is a combination of a wardrobe and a chest of drawers.

==History==
[[Image:19th century chest.JPG|thumb|right|A predecessor to the chest of drawers, an early 19th-century American painted pine blanket chest]]
In late [[medieval]] [[Europe]] the chest came into widespread use, especially in homes of the nobility. This type, also known as a '''coffer''' was more or less a simple joined wooden box with a hinged lid. It may or may not have stood on feet. An early transitional phase was the installation of one drawer beneath this main compartment.  A number of early pieces from the seventeenth century are extant of [[oak]] manufacture  from [[England]], and corresponding seventeenth century pieces of [[France|French]] [[walnut]] have survived.  Some of the early surviving English specimens are from the [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] period. Nutting ascribes the earliest piece in his  '''Furniture Treasury''' to "before 1649".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Furniture Treasury|last=Nutting|first=Wallace|year=1928|publisher=MacMillan|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Styles==
Mule Chest: A chest commonly wider than it is high and deep. A mule chest has drawers in its base and a hinged top, beneath which there are either two short drawers or one long one. This form, introduced in England in the 1600, was popular for 100 years in England and colonial America.

[[File:Frets, guitar neck, C-major chord.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A [[guitar player]] performing a C chord with G bass.]]

A '''chord''', in [[music]], is any [[harmony|harmonic]] set of pitches consisting of two or more (usually three or more) [[Musical note|notes]] (also called "pitches") that are heard as if sounding [[Simultaneity (music)|simultaneously]].&lt;ref&gt;Benward &amp; Saker (2003). ''Music: In Theory and Practice, Vol. I'', pp.&amp;nbsp;67, 359. Seventh Edition. {{ISBN|978-0-07-294262-0}}."A ''chord'' is a harmonic unit with at least three different tones sounding simultaneously." "A combination of three or more pitches sounding at the same time."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Introducing Music |last=Károlyi |first=Otto |year=1965 |publisher=Penguin Books |page=63 |quote=Two or more notes sounding simultaneously are known as a ''chord''.}}&lt;/ref&gt; (For many practical and theoretical purposes, [[arpeggio]]s and broken chords, or sequences of [[Factor (chord)|chord tones]], may also be considered as chords.)

Chords and [[Chord progression|sequences of chords]] are frequently used in modern West African&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, Barry (January 16, 2008). "[http://theoryofmusic.wordpress.com/2008/01/16/an-explanation-for-the-emergence-of-jazz-1956/ An explanation for the emergence of Jazz (1956)]", ''Theory of Music''.&lt;/ref&gt; and Oceanic music,&lt;ref&gt;Linkels, Ad, ''The Real Music of Paradise"'', In Broughton, Simon and Ellingham, Mark with McConnachie, James and Duane, Orla (Ed.), ''World Music, Vol. 2: Latin &amp; North America, Caribbean, India, Asia and Pacific'', pp. 218–29. Rough Guides Ltd, Penguin Books. {{ISBN|1-85828-636-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Western classical music, and Western [[popular music]]; yet, they are absent from the music of many other parts of the world.&lt;ref name="Malm"&gt;Malm, William P. (1996). ''Music Cultures of the Pacific, the Near East, and Asia''. p.15. {{ISBN|0-13-182387-6}}. Third edition: "Indeed, this harmonic orientation is one of the major differences between Western and much non-Western music."&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[tonality|tonal]] Western classical music (music with a [[tonic key]] or "home key"), the most frequently encountered chords are [[Triad (music)|triad]]s, so called because they consist of three distinct notes: the root note, and [[Interval (music)|Intervals]] of a [[Third (chord)|third]] and a [[Fifth (chord)|fifth]] above the root note. Other chords with more than three notes include [[added tone chord]]s, [[extended chord]]s and [[tone cluster]]s, which are used in [[contemporary classical music]], [[jazz]] and other genres.

An ordered series of chords is called a [[chord progression]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=96DcAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA39&amp;dq=chord+progression+is+ordered+series+of+chords&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj3nO--jp7VAhVIr1QKHfHKAhIQ6AEISDAH#v=onepage&amp;q=chord%20progression%20is%20ordered%20series%20of%20chords&amp;f=false|title=Understanding and Crafting the Mix: The Art of Recording|last=Moylan|first=William|date=2014-06-20|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=9781136117589|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; One example of a widely used chord progression in Western [[traditional music]] and [[blues]] is the [[12-bar blues|12 bar blues progression]]. Although any chord may in principle be followed by any other chord, certain patterns of chords are more common in Western music, and some patterns have been accepted as establishing the [[Key (music)|key]] ([[tonic note]]) in [[Common practice harmony|common-practice harmony]]–notably the movement between [[Tonic (music)|tonic]] and [[Dominant (music)|dominant]] chords.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} To describe this, Western [[music theory]] has developed the practice of numbering chords using [[Roman numeral analysis|Roman numerals]]&lt;ref name="Schoenberg"&gt;Arnold Schoenberg, ''Structural Functions of Harmony'', Faber and Faber, 1983, pp. 1–2.&lt;/ref&gt; which represent the number of [[diatonic]] steps up from the tonic note of the [[Scale (music)|scale]].

Common ways of notating or representing chords&lt;ref name="B&amp;S 1"&gt;Benward &amp; Saker (2003), p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt; in Western music (other than conventional [[staff notation]]) include [[Roman numeral analysis|Roman numerals]], the [[Nashville number system]], [[figured bass]], [[Macro analysis|macro symbols]] (sometimes used in modern [[musicology]]), and [[chord chart]]s.

[[File:Mussorgsky Pictures at an Exhibition, chords.PNG|300px|right|thumb|Mussorgsky's ''Pictures at an Exhibition'' "Promenade", is a piece showing an explicit chord progression.(Nattiez 1990, p. 218) {{audio|Mussorgsky Pictures at an Exhibition, chords.mid|Play}}]]

The English word ''chord'' derives from Middle English ''cord'', a shortening of ''accord''&lt;ref&gt;Merriam-Webster, Inc. (1995). "Chord", ''[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/chord Merriam-Webster's dictionary of English usage]'', p.243. {{ISBN|978-0-87779-132-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; in the original sense of ''agreement'' and later, ''harmonious sound''.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/chord?rskey=UjcqH7&amp;result=1#m_en_gb0146870 Chord]", ''Oxford Dictionaries''.&lt;/ref&gt; A sequence of chords is known as a chord progression or harmonic progression. These are frequently used in Western music.&lt;ref name="Malm" /&gt; A chord progression  "aims for a definite goal" of establishing (or contradicting) a tonality founded on a key, root or [[Tonic (music)|tonic]] chord.&lt;ref name="Schoenberg" /&gt; The study of harmony involves chords and chord progressions, and the principles of connection that govern them.&lt;ref&gt;{{GroveOnline|title=Harmony|author=Dahlhaus, Car|access-date=24 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ottó Károlyi]]&lt;ref&gt;Károlyi, Ottó, ''Introducing Music'', p.&amp;nbsp;63. England: Penguin Books.&lt;/ref&gt; writes that, "Two or more notes sounded simultaneously are known as a chord," though, since instances of any given note in different octaves may be taken as the same note, it is more precise for the purposes of analysis to speak of distinct ''pitch classes''. Furthermore, as three notes are needed to define any [[Common chord (music)|common chord]], three is often taken as the minimum number of notes that form a definite chord.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold Schoenberg, ''Theory of Harmony'', p.26: "It is required of a chord that it consist of three different tones."&lt;/ref&gt; Hence [[Andrew Surmani]], for example, (2004, p.&amp;nbsp;72) states, "When three or more notes are sounded together, the combination is called a chord." George T. Jones (1994, p.&amp;nbsp;43) agrees: "Two tones sounding together are usually termed an ''interval'', while three or more tones are called a ''chord''." According to Monath (1984, p.&amp;nbsp;37); "A chord is a combination of three or more tones sounded simultaneously," and the distances between the tones are called intervals. However sonorities of two pitches, or even single-note melodies, are commonly heard as ''implying'' chords.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Schellenberg

In the key of C major, if the music comes to rest on the two notes G and B, most listeners will hear this as a G major chord.

Since a chord may be understood as such even when all its notes are not simultaneously audible, there has been some academic discussion regarding the point at which a group of notes may be called a ''chord''. [[Jean-Jacques Nattiez]] (1990, p.&amp;nbsp;218) explains that, "We can encounter 'pure chords' in a musical work," such as in the ''Promenade'' of [[Modest Mussorgsky]]'s ''[[Pictures at an Exhibition]]'' but, "Often, we must go from a textual given to a more ''abstract'' representation of the chords being used," as in Claude Debussy's ''[[Arabesques (Debussy)|Première Arabesque]]''.

[[File:Debussy Premiere Arabesque melody and chords.png|300px|left|thumb|Upper stave: [[Claude Debussy]]'s ''[[Arabesques (Debussy)|Première Arabesque.]]'' The chords on the lower stave are constructed from the notes in the actual piece, shown on the upper stave. {{audio|Debussy Premiere Arabesque melody and chords.mid|Play}}]]

In the [[medieval music|medieval]] era, early Christian [[hymn]]s featured [[organum]] (which used the simultaneous perfect intervals of a fourth, a fifth, and an octave&lt;ref&gt;Duarter, John (2008). ''Melody &amp; Harmony for Guitarists'', p.49. {{ISBN|978-0-7866-7688-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;), with chord progressions and harmony an incidental result of the emphasis on melodic lines during the medieval and then [[Renaissance]] (15th to 17th centuries).&lt;ref name="B&amp;S 2"&gt;Benward &amp; Saker (2003), p.185.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="B&amp;S70"&gt;Benward &amp; Saker (2003), p.70.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Baroque]] period, the 17th and 18th centuries, began to feature the major and minor scale based tonal system and harmony, including chord progressions and [[circle progression]]s.&lt;ref name="B&amp;S"&gt;Benward &amp; Saker (2003), p.&amp;nbsp;77.&lt;/ref&gt; It was in the Baroque period that the accompaniment of melodies with chords was developed, as in figured bass,&lt;ref name="B&amp;S70"/&gt; and the familiar cadences (perfect authentic, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;Benward &amp; Saker (2003), p.100.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Renaissance, certain dissonant sonorities that suggest the dominant seventh occurred with frequency.&lt;ref name="B&amp;S201"&gt;Benward &amp; Saker (2003), p.201.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Baroque period the dominant seventh proper was introduced, and was in constant use in the Classical and Romantic periods.&lt;ref name="B&amp;S201"/&gt; The [[leading-tone seventh chord|leading-tone seventh]] appeared in the Baroque period and remains in use.&lt;ref&gt;Benward &amp; Saker (2003), p.220.&lt;/ref&gt; Composers began to use [[nondominant seventh chord]]s in the Baroque period. They became frequent in the Classical period, gave way to [[Altered chord|altered dominants]] in the Romantic period, and underwent a resurgence in the Post-Romantic and [[Impressionist music|Impressionistic]] period.&lt;ref&gt;Benward &amp; Saker (2003), p.231.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Romantic period]], the 19th century, featured increased [[chromaticism]].&lt;ref name="B&amp;S"/&gt; Composers began to use secondary dominants in the Baroque, and they became common in the Romantic period.&lt;ref&gt;Benward &amp; Saker (2003), p.274.&lt;/ref&gt; Many contemporary popular Western genres continue to rely on simple diatonic harmony, though far from universally:&lt;ref&gt;Winston Harrison, ''The Rockmaster System: Relating Ongoing Chords to the Keyboard – Rock, Book 1'', Dellwin Publishing Co. 2005, p. 33 [https://books.google.com/books?id=l0Vx5VB96FQC&amp;pg=PA33&amp;dq=diatonic+chords+popular+music&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=gDuoTYm6DMzQ4waPkuWzCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; notable exceptions include the music of film scores, which often use chromatic, atonal or post-tonal harmony, and modern jazz (especially circa 1960), in which chords may include up to seven notes (and occasionally more).&lt;ref&gt;Pachet, François, ''Surprising Harmonies'', International Journal on ComputingAnticipatory Systems, 1999. [https://scholar.google.com/] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110330131204/https://scholar.google.com/ |date=March 30, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When referring to chords that do not function as harmony, such as in atonal music, the term "sonority" is often used specifically to avoid any tonal implications of the word "chord"{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}}.

Triads consist of three notes; the ''root'' or ''first'' note, the ''third'', and the ''fifth''.&lt;ref&gt;Pen, Ronald (1992). ''Introduction to Music'', p.81. McGraw-Hill, {{ISBN|0-07-038068-6}}. "In each case the note that forms the foundation pitch is called the ''root'', the middle tone of the chord is designated the ''third'' (because it is separated by the interval of a third from the root), and the top tone is referred to as the ''fifth'' (because it is a fifth away from the root)."&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the '''C''' [[major scale]] consists of the notes '''C D E F G A B''': a triad can be constructed on any note of such a major scale, and all are minor or major except the triad on the seventh or [[leading-tone]], which is a diminished chord. A triad formed using the note '''C''' itself consists of '''C''' (the root note), '''E''' (the third note of the scale) and '''G''' (the fifth note of the scale). The interval from '''C''' to '''E''' is of four semitones, a [[major third]], and so this triad is called '''C''' Major. A triad formed upon the same scale but with '''D''' as the root note, '''D''' (root),''' F''' (third), '''A''' (fifth), on the other hand, has only three semitones between the root and third and is called '''D''' minor, a minor triad.

==Notation==
{{Redirects|Chord symbol||Chord names and symbols (popular music)}}
[[Image:C triad.svg|thumb|right|200px|C Major triad represented in staff notation]]

Chords can be represented in various ways. The most common notation systems are:&lt;ref name="B&amp;S" /&gt;
# Plain staff notation, used in classical music
# [[Roman numeral analysis|Roman numerals]], commonly used in [[harmonic analysis (music)|harmonic analysis]] to denote the [[Scale (music)|scale step]] on which the chord is built.&lt;ref name="Schoenberg" /&gt;
# [[Figured bass]], much used in the Baroque era, uses numbers added to a bass line written on [[staff (music)]], to enable keyboard players to [[Improvised music|improvise]] chords with the right hand while playing the bass with their left.
# [[Macro analysis|Macro symbols]], sometimes used in modern musicology, to denote chord root and quality.
# Various [[Chord names and symbols (popular music)|chord names and symbols]] used in popular music lead sheets, [[fake book]]s, and chord charts, to quickly lay out the harmonic groundplan of a piece so that the musician may [[musical improvisation|improvise]], [[Jam (music)|jam]], or [[Vamp (music)|vamp]] on it.

===Roman numerals===
{{Main|Roman numeral analysis}}
[[Image:Vi-ii-V-I in C.png|thumb|right|The chord progression vi–ii–V–I in the key of C major. Using lead sheet chord names, these chords could be referred to as A minor, D minor, G major and C major.&lt;ref&gt;William G Andrews and Molly Sclater (2000). ''Materials of Western Music Part 1'', p. 227. {{ISBN|1-55122-034-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; {{audio|Vi-ii-V-I in C.mid|Play}}.]]

While [[scale degree]]s are typically represented in musical analysis or musicology articles with [[Arabic numeral]]s (e.g., 1, 2, 3..., sometimes with a [[circumflex]] above the numeral: {{music|scale|1}}, {{music|scale|2}}, {{music|scale|3}}...), the triads (three-note chords) that have these degrees as their roots are often identified by Roman numerals (e.g., I, IV, V, which in the key of C major would be the triads C major, F major, G major). In some conventions (as in this and related articles) upper-case [[Roman numeral]]s indicate major triads (e.g., I, IV, V) while lower-case Roman numerals indicate minor triads (e.g., I for a major chord and i for a minor chord, or using the major key, ii, iii and vi representing typical diatonic minor triads): other writers, (e.g. [[Schoenberg]]) use upper case Roman numerals for both major and minor triads. Some writers use upper-case Roman numerals to indicate the chord is diatonic in the major scale, and lower-case Roman numerals to indicate that the chord is diatonic in the minor scale. Diminished triads may be represented by lower-case Roman numerals with a [[degree symbol]] (e.g., vii{{music|dim}}&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; indicates a diminished seventh chord built on the seventh scale degree; in the key of C major, this chord would be b diminished seventh, which consists of the notes B, D, F and G{{music|#}}).

Roman numerals can also be used in stringed instrument notation to indicate the [[Violin#Positions|position]] or string to play. In some string music, the string on which it is suggested that the performer play the note is indicated with a Roman numeral (e.g., on a four-string [[string orchestra|orchestral string]] instrument (violin, viola, cello or double bass), I indicates the highest-pitched, thinnest string and IV indicates the lowest-pitched, thickest bass string). In some orchestral parts, chamber music and solo works for string instruments, the composer specifies to the performer which string should be used with the Roman numeral. Alternately, the note name of the string that the composer wishes the performer to use are stated using letters (e.g., "sul G" means "play on the G string").

===Figured bass notation===
{{Main|Figured bass}}
[[Image:C with 64 figured bass.svg|thumb|left|A bass note with figured bass symbols underneath the staff. The figured bass symbols indicate the intervals the chord-playing musician should play above the bass note. The figure in this illustration indicates that the intervals of a sixth above the bass and a fourth above the bass should be played.]]
Figured bass or thoroughbass is a kind of [[musical notation]] used in almost all Baroque music ({{circa}} 1600–1750), though rarely in  music from later than 1750, to indicate harmonies in relation to a conventionally written [[bass line]]. Figured bass is closely associated with chord-playing [[Figured bass#Basso continuo|basso continuo]] [[accompaniment]] instruments, which include [[harpsichord]], [[pipe organ]] and [[lute]]. Added numbers, symbols and [[Accidental (music)|accidentals]] beneath the staff indicate at the intervals to play, the numbers stand for the number of scale steps above the written note to play the figured notes. In the 2010s, some classical musicians who specialize in music from the Baroque era can still perform chords using figured bass notation; in many cases, however, the chord-playing performers read a fully notated accompaniment that has been prepared for the piece by the music publisher. Such a part, with fully written-out chords, is called a "realization" of the figured bass part.

In the illustration the bass note is a '''C''', and the numbers 4 and 6 indicate that notes a fourth and a sixth above, that is '''F''' and '''A''', should be played, giving the [[second inversion]] of the '''F''' major triad. If no numbers are written beneath a bass note, this is assumed to indicate the figure 5,3, which calls for a third and a fifth above the bass note (i.e., a root position triad).

===Macro analysis===
[[Image:Macro analysis chords on C.png|thumb|right|300px|Macro analysis for triads on C.]]
{{Main|Macro analysis}}
Macro analysis is used by [[musicologist]]s, music theorists and advanced university music students to analyze songs and pieces. Macro analysis uses upper-case and lower-case letters to indicate the roots of chords, followed by symbols that specify the chord quality.&lt;ref name="B&amp;S 3"&gt;Benward &amp; Saker (2003). ''Music: In Theory and Practice'', Vol. I,  pp. 74–75. Seventh Edition. {{ISBN|978-0-07-294262-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Basics===
{{Main|Chord names and symbols (popular music)}}
In most [[List of popular music genres|genres]] of popular music, including jazz, [[pop music|pop]], and rock, a chord name and the corresponding symbol are typically composed of one or more parts. In these genres, chord-playing musicians in the [[rhythm section]] (e.g., [[electric guitar]], [[acoustic guitar]], [[piano]], [[Hammond organ]], etc.) typically [[improvisation (music)|improvise]] the specific "[[Voicing (music)|voicing]]" of each chord from a song's chord progression by interpreting the written chord symbols appearing in the lead sheet or [[fake book]]. Normally, these chord symbols include:
* A (big) letter indicating the [[root (chord)|root note]] (e.g.  C).
* A symbol or abbreviation indicating the [[Chord names and symbols (popular music)#Chord quality|chord quality]] (e.g. minor, aug or '''{{music|dim}}''' ). ''(If no chord quality is specified, the chord is assumed to be a Major triad by default)''.
* Number(s) indicating the stacked [[Interval (music)#Number|intervals]] above the root note (e.g. 7 or 13).
* Additional musical symbols or abbreviations for special alterations (e.g. {{music|b}}5, {{music|#}}5 or  add13).
* An added slash "/" and an upper case letter indicates that a bass note other than the root should be played.  (e.g.  C/F indicates that an C Major triad should be played with an added F in the bass).

Chord qualities are related with the [[Interval (music)#Quality|qualities]] of the component intervals that define the chord. The main chord qualities are:
* Major and minor (a chord is "Major" by default and altered with added info:  "C" = C Major,  "Cm" = c minor).
* [[Augmented chord|augmented]], [[diminished triad|diminished]], and [[half-diminished seventh chord|half-diminished]],
* [[dominant chord|dominant seventh]].

===Symbols===
The symbols used for notating chords are:
* '''m''' or '''min''' for minor  ''(the minor quality should always be written in small letters)'',&lt;ref name="correction"&gt;The assumption that a chord can be indicated "the German way"; using only capital or small letters ("C" for Major, or "c" for minor) is a fatal misunderstanding. The German tradition only uses this when describing the tonality of the key (g-minor, or F#-Major). To try to use this for chords is woefully inaccurate and shouldn't be used.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''−''' ''A hyphen/minus symbol is sometimes used for minor, this is common in jazz lead sheets''
* '''M''', '''Ma''', '''Maj''', or no symbol for Major  ''(the Major quality should always be written with (a) Capital letter)'',
* '''{{music|major}}''' ''The symbol '''{{music|major}}''' is also commonly used for Major. (In a jazz context, this typically indicates that the player should use any suitable chord of a major quality, for example a [[major seventh chord|a Major seventh]] chord or a 6/9 chord. In a lot of jazz styles, an unembellished major triad is rarely if ever played, but in a lead sheet the choice of which major quality chord to use is left to the performer)''
* '''+''' or '''aug''' is used for [[Augmented chord|augmented]] ('''A''' or '''a''' is not used),
* '''{{music|dim}}'''  or '''dim''' is used for [[diminished triad|diminished]] ('''d''' is not used),
* '''{{music|halfdim}}''' is used for [[half-diminished seventh chord|half-diminished]] (in some [[fake book]]s, the abbreviation  m&lt;sup&gt;7({{music|b}}5)&lt;/sup&gt;  is used as an equivalent symbol),
* '''2''' Is mostly used as an extra note in a chord (e.g. add2, sus2),
* '''3''' Is the minor or Major quality of the chord and hardly ever gets written as a number,
* '''4''' Is mostly used as an extra note in a chord (e.g. add4, sus4),
* '''5''' Is the (perfect) fifth of the chord and is only written as a number when [[Chord names and symbols (popular music)#Altered fifths|altered]] (e.g. F7&lt;sup&gt;({{music|b}}5)&lt;/sup&gt;). (exception, [[power chord]]s; see below),
* '''6''' is used for a [[sixth chord]]. There are no rules if the 6 '''replaces''' the 5th or not.
* '''7''' is used for a [[dominant seventh chord|dominant 7th chord]]. However, if Maj7, M7 or {{music|major}}7 is indicated, this is a [[major seventh|Major 7th chord]] (e.g. G&lt;sup&gt;M7&lt;/sup&gt; or F&lt;sup&gt;Δ7&lt;/sup&gt;). Very rarely, also '''dom''' is used for dominant 7th,
* '''9''' is used for a [[ninth chord]], which in jazz usually includes the dominant seventh as well, if it is a dominant chord,
* '''11''' is used for a [[eleventh chord]], which in jazz usually includes the dominant seventh and ninth as well, if it is a dominant chord,
* '''13''' is used for a [[thirteenth chord]] , which in jazz usually includes the dominant seventh, ninth and eleventh as well,
* '''6/9''' indicates a triad with the addition of the sixth and ninth,
* '''sus4''' (or simply '''4''') indicates that the third is omitted and the fourth used instead. Other notes may be added to a sus4 chord, indicated with the word "add" and the scale degree (e.g., A&lt;sup&gt;sus4(add9)&lt;/sup&gt; or A&lt;sup&gt;sus4(add7)&lt;/sup&gt;).
* '''sus2''' (or simply '''2''') indicates that the third is omitted and the second (which may also be called the ninth) is used instead. As with "sus4", a "sus2" chord can have other scale degrees added (e.g., A&lt;sup&gt;sus2(add{{music|b}}7)&lt;/sup&gt; or A&lt;sup&gt;sus2(add4)&lt;/sup&gt;)
* '''({{music|b}}9)''' (parenthesis) is used to indicate explicit chord alterations (e.g., A&lt;sup&gt;7({{music|b}}9)&lt;/sup&gt;). The parenthesis is probably left from older days when jazz musicians weren't used to "altered chords". Albeit important, the parenthesis can be left unplayed (with no "musical harm"),
* '''add''' indicates that an additional interval number should be added to the chord. (e.g. C&lt;sup&gt;7add13&lt;/sup&gt; is a C 7th chord plus an added 13th),
* '''alt''' (or "alt dom") is used in jazz to indicate an [[altered dominant]] seventh chord (e.g. G&lt;sup&gt;7{{music|#}}11&lt;/sup&gt;),
* '''omit5''' (or simply no5) indicates that the (indicated) note should be left out from the chord,

===Special notation===
* In some genres of modern jazz, two chords with a slash between them may indicate an advanced voicing called a [[polychord]], which is the playing of two chords simultaneously.
The correct notation of this should be {{sfrac|F|C}}, and can sometimes get mixed up with the normal altered bass notation. e.g., F/C.

* In guitar-based music, like rock and metal, a "5" indicates that a [[power chord]] should be played. A power chord consists only of the root and the fifth, possibly with the root doubled an octave higher.

===Utilization===
The basic function  of using chord-symbols is to eliminate the need to write notes on a sheet of paper.
The modern jazz-player has extensive knowledge of the chordal functions, and can mostly play music by reading the chord symbols only.
Especially in Jazz music, the advanced chords are common. Altered 9ths, 11ths and 5ths are not that common in pop music.

The interpretation of chord symbols depends on the genre of music being played. In jazz from the [[bebop]] era or later, Major and minor chords are typically voiced as 7th chords even if only "C" or "Cm" appear in the chart. In jazz charts, 7th chords are often voiced with upper extensions, such as the ninth, sharp eleventh and thirteenth, even if the chart only indicates "A&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;". As well, in jazz, the root and fifth are often omitted from chord [[voicing (music)|voicings]], except when there is a diminished fifth or an augmented fifth. The root can be omitted because it is being played by the [[Bass (instrument)|bass]] instrument.

In a pop or rock context, however, "C" and "Cm" would almost always be played as triads, with no sevenths. In pop and rock, in the relatively less common cases where songwriters wish a dominant seventh, major seventh or minor seventh chord, they will indicate this explicitly with the indications "C&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;", "C&lt;sup&gt;maj7&lt;/sup&gt;" or "Cm&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;".

Some of the symbols used for chord quality are similar to those used for [[Interval (music)#Shorthand notation|interval quality]]:

==Characteristics==
Within the [[diatonic scale]], every chord has certain characteristics, which include:
* Number of [[pitch class]]es (distinct notes without respect to octave) that constitute the chord.
* [[Degree (music)|Scale degree]] of the root note
*[[Inverted chord|Position or inversion]] of the chord
* General type of intervals it appears constructed from—for example seconds, thirds, or fourths
* Counts of each pitch class as occur between all [[combination]]s of notes the chord contains

Two-note combinations, whether referred to as chords or intervals, are called ''dyads''. Chords constructed of three notes of some underlying [[musical scale|scale]] are described as ''triads''. Chords of four notes are known as ''tetrads'', those containing five are called ''pentads'' and those using six are ''hexads''. Sometimes the terms ''trichord'', ''tetrachord'', ''pentachord'', and ''hexachord'' are used—though these more usually refer to the pitch classes of any scale, not generally played simultaneously. Chords that may contain more than three notes include [[pedal point]] chords, dominant seventh chords, extended chords, added tone chords, [[tone cluster|clusters]], and polychords.

[[Polychord]]s are formed by two or more chords superimposed.&lt;ref&gt;Haerle, Dan (1982). ''The Jazz Language: A Theory Text for Jazz Composition and Improvisation'', p. 30. {{ISBN|978-0-7604-0014-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Often these may be analysed as extended chords; examples include [[tertian]], [[altered chord]], [[secundal|secundal chord]], [[quartal and quintal harmony]] and [[Tristan chord]]). Another example is when G&lt;sup&gt;7({{music|#}}11{{music|b}}9)&lt;/sup&gt; (G–B–D–F–A{{music|b}}–C{{music|#}}) is formed from G major (G–B–D) and D{{music|b}} major (D{{music|b}}–F–A{{music|b}}).&lt;ref&gt;Policastro, Michael A. (1999). ''Understanding How to Build Guitar Chords and Arpeggios'', p. 168. {{ISBN|978-0-7866-4443-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A [[nonchord tone]] is a [[Consonance and dissonance|dissonant]] or unstable tone that lies outside the chord currently heard, though often [[resolution (music)|resolving]] to a chord tone.&lt;ref&gt;Benward &amp; Saker (2003), p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:C Major scale (up and down).svg|412px|right|thumb|C major scale {{Audio|C major scale.mid|play}}]]

In the key of '''C major''' the first degree of the scale, called the [[tonic (music)|tonic]], is the note '''C''' itself, so a '''C''' major chord, a triad built on the note '''C''', may be called the ''one chord'' of that key and notated in Roman numerals as '''I'''. The same '''C''' major chord can be found in other scales: it forms chord '''III''' in the key of '''A minor''' ('''A'''–''B''–'''C''') and chord '''IV''' in the key of '''G major''' ('''G'''''–A–B–'''''C'''). This numbering lets us see the job a chord is doing in the current key and tonality.

Many analysts use lower-case Roman numerals to indicate minor triads and upper-case for major ones, and ''degree'' and ''plus'' signs ( '''{{music|dim}}''' and '''{{music|aug}}''' ) to indicate diminished and augmented triads respectively. Otherwise all the numerals may be upper-case and the qualities of the chords inferred from the scale degree. Chords outside the scale can be indicated by placing a flat/sharp sign before the chord—for example, the chord of '''E{{music|b}}''' major in the key of '''C''' major is represented by '''{{music|b}}III'''. The tonic of the scale may be indicated to the left (e.g. '''F{{music|#}}:''') or may be understood from a key signature or other contextual clues. Indications of [[Inverted chord|inversions]] or added tones may be omitted if they are not relevant to the analysis. Roman numerals indicate the root of the chord as a [[scale degree]] within a particular major key as follows:

{{Main|Inverted chord}}

In the harmony of Western art music, a chord is in ''root position'' when the tonic note is the lowest in the chord, and the other notes are above it. When the lowest note is not the tonic, the chord is ''inverted''. Chords that have many constituent notes can have many different inverted positions as shown below for the C major chord:

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align: center;"
|-
! Bass note || Position || Order of notes || Notation
|-
! C
|[[root position]]|| C E G or C G E || {{su|p=5|b=3}} as G is a fifth above C and E is a third above C
|-
! E
|[[first inversion]]|| E G C or E C G || {{su|p=6|b=3}} as C is a sixth above E and G is a third above E
|-
! G
|[[second inversion]]|| G C E  or G E C|| {{su|p=6|b=4}} as E is a sixth above G and C is a fourth above G
|}

Further, a four-note chord can be inverted to four different positions by the same method as triadic inversion. For example, a G&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; chord can be in root position (G as bass note); first inversion (B as bass note); second inversion (D as bass note); or third inversion (F as bass note). Where [[guitar chord]]s are concerned the term "inversion" is used slightly differently; to refer to stock fingering "shapes".&lt;ref&gt;[[Bert Weedon]], ''Play in a Day'', Faber Music Ltd, {{ISBN|0-571-52965-8}}, ''passim''  – among a wide range of other guitar tutors&lt;/ref&gt;

Many chords are a sequence of ascending notes separated by intervals of roughly the same size. Chords can be classified into different categories by this size:
* [[Tertian|Tertian chords]] can be decomposed into a series of (major or minor) thirds. For example, the C [[major triad]] (C–E–G) is defined by a sequence of two intervals, the first (C–E) being a major third and the second (E–G) being a [[minor third]]. Most common chords are tertian.
* [[Secundal|Secundal chords]] can be decomposed into a series of (major or minor) seconds. For example, the chord C–D–E{{music|b}} is a series of seconds, containing a [[major second]] (C–D) and a [[minor second]] (D–E{{music|b}}).
* Quartal chords can be decomposed into a series of (perfect or augmented) fourths. Quartal harmony normally works with a combination of perfect and augmented fourths. Diminished fourths are enharmonically equivalent to major thirds, so they are uncommon.&lt;ref&gt;Connie E. Mayfield (2012) "Theory Essentials", p. 523. {{ISBN|1-133-30818-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the chord C–F–B is a series of fourths, containing a [[perfect fourth]] (C–F) and an [[augmented fourth]]/[[tritone]] (F–B).

These terms can become ambiguous when dealing with non-[[diatonic scale]]s, such as the [[Pentatonic scale|pentatonic]] or [[chromatic scale]]s. The use of accidentals can also complicate the terminology. For example, the chord B{{music|#}}–E–A{{music|b}} appears to be quartal, as a series of diminished fourths (B{{music|#}}–E and E–A{{music|b}}), but it is [[enharmonic equivalence|enharmonically equivalent]] to (and sonically indistinguishable from) the tertian chord C–E–G{{music|#}}, which is a series of major thirds (C–E and E–G{{music|#}}).

===Harmonic content===
The notes of a chord form intervals with each of the other notes of the chord in [[combination]].  A 3-note chord has 3 of these harmonic intervals, a 4-note chord has 6, a 5-note chord has 10, a 6-note chord has 15.&lt;ref&gt;Hanson, Howard. (1960) ''Harmonic Materials of Modern Music'', pp. 7ff. New York: Appleton-Century-Crofts. LOC 58-8138.&lt;/ref&gt;  The absence, presence, and placement of certain key intervals plays a large part in the sound of the chord, and sometimes of the selection of the chord that follows.

A chord containing tritones is called [[Anhemitonic scale|tritonic]]; one without tritones is atritonic. Harmonic tritones are an important part of dominant seventh chords, giving their sound a characteristic tension, and making the tritone interval likely to move in certain stereotypical ways to the following chord.&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin, Horvit, and Nelson (2008). ''Techniques and Materials of Music'', pp. 46–47. {{ISBN|0-495-50054-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Tritones are also present in diminished seventh and half-diminished chords.

A chord containing [[semitone]]s, whether appearing as [[Minor second]]s or Major sevenths, is called hemitonic; one without semitones is anhemitonic.  Harmonic semitones are an important part of [[Major seventh chord|Major seventh]] chords, giving their sound a characteristic high tension, and making the harmonic semitone likely to move in certain stereotypical ways to the following chord.&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin, Horvit, and Nelson (2008). ''Techniques and Materials of Music'', pp. 48–49. {{ISBN|0-495-50054-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  A chord containing Major sevenths but no Minor seconds is much less harsh in sound than one containing Minor seconds as well.

Other chords of interest might include the
* Diminished chord, which has many minor thirds and no major thirds, many tritones but no [[perfect fifth]]s
* [[Augmented chord]], which has many major thirds and no minor thirds or perfect fifths
* [[Dominant seventh diminished five chord]], which has many major thirds and tritones and no minor thirds or perfect fifths

{{Main|Seventh chord}}
{{See also|Chord names and symbols (jazz and pop music)#Seventh chords|l1=Jazz and pop notation for seventh chords}}
Seventh chords are tertian chords, constructed by adding a fourth note to a triad, at the interval of a third above the fifth of the chord. This creates the interval of a seventh above the root of the chord, the next natural step in composing tertian chords. The seventh chord built on the fifth step of the scale (the dominant seventh) is the only one available in the major scale: it contains all three notes of the diminished triad of the seventh and is frequently used as a stronger substitute for it.

There are various [[Seventh chord#Types of seventh chords|types of seventh chords]] depending on the quality of both the chord and the seventh added. In chord notation the chord type is sometimes superscripted and sometimes not (e.g. ''Dm7'', ''Dm&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;'', and ''D&lt;sup&gt;m7&lt;/sup&gt;'' are all identical).

==Extended chords==
{{Main|Extended chord}}
{{see also|Chord names and symbols (jazz and pop music)#Extended tertian chords|l1=Jazz and pop notation for extended chords}}

[[Image:Upper-structure triad.png|thumb|right|[[Dominant thirteenth chord|Dominant thirteenth]] extended chord: C E G B{{music|b}} D F A {{Audio|Dominant thirteenth chord on C.mid|play}}. The [[upper structure]] or extensions, i.e. notes beyond the seventh, in red. This chord is just a theoretical illustration of this chord. In practice, a jazz pianist or jazz guitarist would not normally play the chord all in thirds as illustrated. Jazz voicings typically use the third, seventh, and then the extensions such as the ninth and thirteenth, and in some cases the eleventh. The root is often omitted from chord voicings, as the bass player will play the root. The fifth is often omitted if it is a perfect fifth. Augmented and diminished fifths are normally included in voicings.]]

Extended chords are triads with further tertian notes added beyond the seventh: the ninth, eleventh, and thirteenth chords. After the thirteenth, any notes added in thirds duplicate notes elsewhere in the chord; all seven notes of the scale are present in the chord, so adding more notes does not add new pitch classes. Such chords may be constructed only by using notes that lie outside the diatonic seven-note scale.

Other extended chords follow similar rules, so that for example ''maj&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;'', ''maj&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;'', and ''maj&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;'' contain major seventh chords rather than dominant seventh chords, while ''m&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;'', ''m&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;'', and ''m&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;'' contain minor seventh chords.

==Altered chords==
{{Main|Altered chord}}
[[Image:Altered chord on C.png|thumb|Altered chord on C with diminished fifth and minor seventh and ninth. {{Audio|Altered chord on C.mid|Play}}]]
The third and seventh of the chord are always determined by the symbols shown above (the root cannot be so altered without changing the name of the chord, while the third cannot be altered without altering the chord's quality). Nevertheless, the fifth, ninth, eleventh and thirteenth may all be chromatically altered by accidentals. These are noted alongside the altered element. Accidentals are most often used with dominant seventh chords. ''Altered'' dominant seventh chords (C&lt;sup&gt;7alt&lt;/sup&gt;) may have a minor ninth, a sharp ninth, a diminished fifth or an augmented fifth (see Levine's ''Jazz Theory''). Some write this as C&lt;sup&gt;7+9&lt;/sup&gt;, which assumes also the minor ninth, diminished fifth and augmented fifth (see Aebersold's ''Scale Syllabus''). The augmented ninth is often referred to in blues and jazz as a [[blue note]], being enharmonically equivalent to the minor third or tenth. When superscripted numerals are used the different numbers may be listed horizontally (as shown) or else vertically.

==Added tone chords==
{{Main|Added tone chord}}
[[Image:Sus chord.png|thumb|250px|right|[[Suspended chord]] (sus2) and added tone chord ([[ninth|add9]]) both with D ([[octave equivalency|ninth=second]]), distinguished by the absence or presence of the third (E{{music|b}}).&lt;ref&gt;Hawkins, Stan. "[[Prince (musician)|Prince]]- Harmonic Analysis of '[[Lovesexy|Anna Stesia]]'", pp. 329, 334n7, ''Popular Music'', Vol. 11, No. 3 (Oct., 1992), pp. 325–35.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
An added tone chord is a triad chord with an added, non-tertian note, such as the commonly added sixth as well as chords with an added second (ninth) or fourth (eleventh) or a combination of the three. These chords do not include "intervening" thirds as in an extended chord. Added chords can also have variations. Thus ''m&lt;sup&gt;add9&lt;/sup&gt;'', ''m&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;'' and ''m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;'' are minor triads with extended notes.

[[Sixth chord]]s can belong to either of two groups. One is [[first inversion]] chords and added sixth chords that contain a sixth from the root.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Michael (2005). ''The Complete Idiot's Guide to Music Theory'', p. 119. {{ISBN|978-1-59257-437-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The other group is inverted chords in which the interval of a sixth appears above a bass note that is not the root.&lt;ref&gt;Piston, Walter (1987). ''Harmony'' (5th ed.), p. 66. New York: W.W. Norton &amp; Company. {{ISBN|0-393-95480-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The major sixth chord (also called, ''sixth'' or ''added sixth'' with the chord notation ''6'', e.g., ''C&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;'') is by far the most common type of sixth chord of the first group. It comprises a major triad with the added [[major sixth]] above the root, common in popular music.&lt;ref name="B&amp;S"/&gt; For example, the chord ''C&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;'' contains the notes C-E-G-A. The minor sixth chord (''min&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;'' or ''m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;'', e.g., ''Cm&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;'') is a minor triad, still with a major 6. For example, the chord ''Cm&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;'' contains the notes C-E{{music|b}}-G-A}}.

The [[augmented sixth chord]] usually appears in chord notation as its enharmonic equivalent, the seventh chord. This chord contains two notes separated by the interval of an augmented sixth (or, by inversion, a diminished third, though this inversion is rare). The augmented sixth is generally used as a dissonant interval most commonly used in motion towards a dominant chord in root position (with the root doubled to create the octave the augmented sixth chord resolves to) or to a tonic chord in second inversion (a tonic triad with the fifth doubled for the same purpose). In this case, the tonic note of the key is included in the chord, sometimes along with an optional fourth note, to create one of the following (illustrated here in the key of C major):
* Italian augmented sixth: A{{music|b}}, C, F{{music|#}}
* French augmented sixth: A{{music|b}}, C, D, F{{music|#}}
* German augmented sixth: A{{music|b}}, C, E{{music|b}}, F{{music|#}}

The augmented sixth family of chords exhibits certain peculiarities. Since they are not based on triads, as are seventh chords and other sixth chords, they are not generally regarded as having roots (nor, therefore, inversions), although one [[chord voicing|re-voicing]] of the notes is common (with the namesake interval inverted to create a diminished third).&lt;ref&gt;Bartlette, Christopher, and Steven G. Laitz (2010).  Graduate Review of Tonal Theory.  New York: Oxford University Press.  {{ISBN|978-0-19-537698-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second group of sixth chords includes inverted major and minor chords, which may be called ''sixth'' chords in that the ''six-three'' ({{su|p=6|b=3}}) and ''six-four'' ({{su|p=6|b=4}}) chords contain intervals of a sixth with the bass note, though this is not the root. Nowadays this is mostly for academic study or analysis (see figured bass) but the [[Neapolitan sixth|neapolitan sixth chord]] is an important example; a major triad with a flat supertonic scale degree as its root that is called a "sixth" because it is almost always found in first inversion. Though a technically accurate Roman numeral analysis would be {{flat}}II, it is generally labelled N&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;. In C major, the chord is notated (from root position) D{{music|b}}, F, A{{music|b}}. Because it uses chromatically [[altered tone]]s this chord is often grouped with the borrowed chords but the chord is not borrowed from the relative major or minor and it may appear in both major and minor keys.

==Suspended chords==
{{Main|Suspended chord}}
[[Image:Sus4 chord on C.png|thumb|Sus4 chord on C {{Audio|Sus4 chord on C.mid|play}}]]
A suspended chord, or "sus chord" (sometimes wrongly thought to mean ''sustained chord''), is a chord in which the ''third'' is replaced by either the ''second'' or the ''fourth''.  This produces two main chord types: the ''suspended second'' (sus2) and the ''suspended fourth'' (sus4). The chords, '''C&lt;sup&gt;sus2&lt;/sup&gt;''' and '''C&lt;sup&gt;sus4&lt;/sup&gt;''', for example, consist of the notes ''C D G'' and ''C F G'', respectively.  There is also a third type of suspended chord, in which both the second and fourth are present, for example the chord with the notes ''C D F G.''

The name ''[[suspension (music)|suspended]]'' derives from an early [[polyphonic]] technique developed during the [[common practice period]], in which a stepwise melodic progress to a harmonically stable note in any particular part was often momentarily delayed or ''suspended'' by extending the duration of the previous note. The resulting unexpected dissonance could then be all the more satisfyingly resolved by the eventual appearance of the displaced note. In traditional music theory the inclusion of the ''third'' in either chord would negate the suspension, so such chords would be called ''added ninth'' and ''added eleventh'' chords instead.

In modern layman usage the term is restricted to the displacement of the ''third'' only and the dissonant ''second'' or ''fourth'' no longer needs to be held over (''prepared'') from the previous chord. Neither is it now obligatory for the displaced note to make an appearance at all though in the majority of cases the conventional stepwise resolution to the ''third'' is still observed. In [[post-bop]] and [[modal jazz]] compositions and improvisations suspended seventh chords are often used in nontraditional ways: these often do not function as '''V''' chords, and do not resolve from the fourth to the third. The lack of resolution gives the chord an ambiguous, static quality. Indeed, the third is often played on top of a sus4 chord. A good example is the jazz standard, ''[[Maiden Voyage (composition)|Maiden Voyage]]''.

Extended versions are also possible, such as the ''seventh suspended fourth'', which, with root ''C'', contains the notes ''C F G B{{music|b}}'' and is notated as '''C&lt;sup&gt;7sus4&lt;/sup&gt;''' {{Audio|7sus4 chord on C.mid|play}}. '''C&lt;sup&gt;sus4&lt;/sup&gt;''' is sometimes written '''C&lt;sup&gt;sus&lt;/sup&gt;''' since the sus4 is more common than the sus2.

==Borrowed chords==
{{Main|Borrowed chord}}
[[Image:Borrowed chords 1b.gif|thumb|300px|right|Borrowed chords from the parallel minor key are commonly found in the Baroque, Classical and Romantic eras.]]
A [[borrowed chord]] is one from a different key than the ''home key'', the key of the piece it is used in. The most common occurrence of this is where a chord from the [[Parallel key|parallel major or minor]] key is used. Particularly good examples can be found throughout the works of composers such as [[Schubert]]. For instance, for a composer working in the C major key, a major {{music|b}}III chord (e.g., an E{{music|b}} major chord) would be borrowed, as this chord appears only in the C minor key. Although borrowed chords could theoretically include chords taken from any key other than the home key, this is not how the term is used when a chord is described in formal [[musical analysis]].

When a chord is analysed as "borrowed" from another key it may be shown by the Roman numeral corresponding with that key after a slash. For example, '''V/V''' (pronounced "five of five") indicates the dominant chord of the dominant key of the present home-key. The dominant key of '''C''' major is ''' G''' major so this [[secondary dominant]] is the chord of the fifth degree of the '''G''' major scale, which is '''D''' major (which can also be described as '''II''' relative to the key of C major, not to be confused with the [[supertonic]] '''ii''' namely D ''minor''.). If used for a significant duration, the use of the D major chord may cause a [[Modulation (music)|modulation]] to a new key (in this case to G major).

Borrowed chords are widely used in Western popular music and rock music. For example, there are a number of songs in E major which use the {{music|b}}III chord (e.g., a G major chord used in an E major song), the {{music|b}}VII chord  (e.g., a D major chord used in an E major song) and the {{music|b}}VI chord (e.g., a C major chord used in an E major song). All of these chords are "borrowed" from the key of E minor.

'''Connectivism''' is a theory of learning in a digital age that emphasizes the role of social and cultural context in how and where learning occurs. Learning does not simply happen within an individual, but within and across the networks. What sets connectivism apart from theories such as [[Constructivism (philosophy of education)|constructivism]] is the view that "learning (defined as actionable knowledge) can reside outside of ourselves (within an organization or a database), is focused on connecting specialized information sets, and the connections that enable us to learn more are more important than our current state of knowing".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.itdl.org/Journal/Jan_05/article01.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Connectivism sees knowledge as a network and learning as a process of [[pattern recognition]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|first=Alaa A.|first2=António J.|first3=Susana|last-author-amp=yes|date=2015|title=Understanding Knowledge Network, Learning and Connectivism|url=http://www.itdl.org/Journal/Oct_15/Oct15.pdf#page=7|journal=International Journal of Instructional Technology and Distance Learning|volume=12|issue=10|pages=3–21|doi=10.5281/zenodo.46186|pmid=|access-date=|author1=AlDahdouh|author2=Osório|author3=Caires}}&lt;/ref&gt; Connectivism has similarities with Vygotsky's [[zone of proximal development]] (ZPD) and Engeström's [[Activity theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fry|first=Heather|title=Understanding Student Learning|year=2003|publisher=Routledge Falmer|isbn=9780415434645|page=21|author2=Steve Kerridge |author3=Stephanie Marshall }}&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase "a learning theory for the digital age"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itdl.org/Journal/Jan_05/article01.htm Connectivism: A Learning Theory for the Digital Age], International Journal of Instructional Technology and Distance Learning, Vol. 2 No. 1, Jan 2005&lt;/ref&gt; indicates the emphasis that connectivism gives to technology's effect on how people live, communicate, and learn.{{TOC right}}

==Nodes and links==
The central aspect of connectivism is the metaphor of a network with nodes and connections.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.astd.org/LC/2005/1105_seimens.htm Connectivism: Learning as Network-Creation], Learning Circuits, November 2005&lt;/ref&gt; In this metaphor, a node is anything that can be connected to another node such as an organization, information, data, feelings, and images. Connectivism recognizes three node types: neural, conceptual (internal) and external.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Handbook of emerging technologies for learning|author1=Siemens, G. |author2= Tittenberger, P. |last-author-amp=yes |publisher = University of Manitoba|year = |isbn = |location = Manitoba, Canada|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Connectivism sees learning as the process of creating connections and expanding or increasing network complexity. Connections may have different directions and strength.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In this sense, a connection joining nodes A and B which goes from A to B is not the same as one that goes from B to A. There are some special kinds of connections such as "self-join" and pattern.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A self-join connection joins a node to itself and a pattern can be defined as "a set of connections appearing together as a single whole".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The idea of organisation as cognitive systems where knowledge is distributed across nodes originated from the [[Perceptron]] (Artificial neuron) in an [[Artificial neural network|Artificial Neural Network]], and is directly borrowed from [[Connectionism]], "a software structure developed based on concepts inspired by biological functions of brain; it aims at creating machines able to learn like human".&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=AlDahdouh|first=Alaa A.|date=2017|title=Does Artificial Neural Network Support Connectivism’s Assumptions?|url=http://itdl.org/Journal/Mar_17/Mar17.pdf#page=7|journal=International Journal of Instructional Technology and Distance Learning|volume=14|issue=3|pages=3–26|doi=10.5281/zenodo.545695}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The network metaphor allows a notion of "know-where" (the understanding of where to find the knowledge when it is needed) to supplement to the ones of "know-how" and "know-what" that make the cornerstones of many theories of learning.&lt;!--"know-where" needs a more complete definition. --&gt;

As Downes states: "at its heart, connectivism is the thesis that knowledge is distributed across a network of connections, and therefore that learning consists of the ability to construct and traverse those networks".&lt;ref name=downes1&gt;{{cite web|last=Downes|first=Stephen|title=What Connectivism Is|url=http://halfanhour.blogspot.co.uk/2007/02/what-connectivism-is.html|accessdate=05/03/2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Principles===
*Learning and knowledge rests in diversity of opinions.
*Learning is a process of connecting specialized nodes or information sources.
*Learning may reside in non-human appliances.
*Learning is more critical than knowing.
*Maintaining and nurturing connections is needed to facilitate continual learning.
*Perceiving connections between fields, ideas and concepts is a core skill.
*Currency (accurate, up-to-date knowledge) is the intent of learning activities.
*Decision-making is itself a learning process. Choosing what to learn and the meaning of incoming information is seen through the lens of a shifting reality. While there is a right answer now, it may be wrong tomorrow due to alterations in the information climate affecting the decision.

==Teaching methods==
Summarizing connectivist teaching and learning, Downes states: "to teach is to model and demonstrate, to learn is to practice and reflect."&lt;ref name=downes1/&gt;

In 2008, Siemens and Downes delivered an online course called "Connectivism and Connective Knowledge".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Siemens | first = George | authorlink = George Siemens |author2=Stephen Downes | title = Connectivism and Connective Knowledge | url=http://ltc.umanitoba.ca/connectivism/| accessdate = 2009-01-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It covered connectivism as content while attempting to implement some of their ideas. The course was free to anyone who wished to participate, and over 2000 people worldwide enrolled. The phrase "[[Massive open online course|Massive Open Online Course]]" (MOOC) describes this model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Siemens | first = George | authorlink = George Siemens | title = MOOC or Mega-Connectivism Course | url=http://ltc.umanitoba.ca/connectivism/?p=53 | accessdate = 2009-01-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; All course content was available through [[RSS]] feeds, and learners could participate with their choice of tools: threaded discussions in [[Moodle]], blog posts, [[Second Life]] and synchronous online meetings. The course was repeated in 2009 and in 2011.

At its core, connectivism is a form of experiential learning which prioritizes the set of formed by actions and experience over the idea that knowledge is propositional.

==History==

Connectivism was introduced in 2005 by two publications, Siemens’ ''Connectivism: Learning as Network Creation'' and Downes’ ''An Introduction to Connective Knowledge''. Both works received significant attention in the blogosphere and an extended discourse has followed on the appropriateness of connectivism as a learning theory for the digital age. In 2007 Kerr entered into the debate with a series of lectures and talks on the matter, as did Forster, both at the Online Connectivism Conference at the University of Manitoba.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Online Connectivism Conference|url=http://www.21stcenturycollaborative.com/2007/02/connectivism-online-conference/|accessdate=05/03/2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, in the context of digital and e-learning, connectivism was reconsidered and its technological implications were discussed by Siemens' and Ally.

== Criticisms  ==
The idea that connectivism is a new theory of learning is not widely accepted. Verhagen argued that connectivism is rather a "pedagogical view."&lt;ref name="verhagen"&gt;[http://www.surfspace.nl/nl/Redactieomgeving/Publicaties/Documents/Connectivism%20a%20new%20theory.pdf Connectivism: a new learning theory?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081210214143/http://www.surfspace.nl/nl/Redactieomgeving/Publicaties/Documents/Connectivism%20a%20new%20theory.pdf |date=2008-12-10 }}, Pløn Verhagen (University of Twente), November 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The lack of comparative literature reviews in Connectivism papers complicate evaluating how Connectivism relates to prior theories, such as [[Socially Distributed Cognition]] (Hutchins, 1995), which explored how connectionist ideas could be applied to social systems. Classical theories of cognition such as [[Activity theory]] (Vygotsky, Leont’ev, Luria, and others starting in the 1920s) proposed that people are embedded actors, with learning considered via three features – a subject (the learner), an object (the task or activity) and tool or mediating artifacts. [[Social cognitive theory]] (Bandura, 1962) claimed that people learn by watching others. [[Social learning theory]] (Miller and Dollard) elaborated this notion. [[Situated cognition]] (Brown, Collins, &amp; Duguid, 1989; Greeno &amp; Moore, 1993) alleged that knowledge is situated in activity bound to social, cultural and physical contexts;  knowledge and learning that requires thinking on the fly rather than the storage and retrieval of conceptual knowledge. [[Community of practice]] (Lave &amp; Wenger 1991) asserted that the process of sharing information and experiences with the group enables members to learn from each other. [[Collective intelligence]] (Lévy, 1994) described a shared or group intelligence that emerges from collaboration and competition.

Kerr claims that although technology affects learning environments, existing learning theories are sufficient.&lt;ref name="kerr"&gt;[http://billkerr2.blogspot.com/2007/02/which-radical-discontinuity.html which radical discontinuity?], Bill Kerr, February 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Kop and Hill&lt;ref name= "Kop"&gt;[http://www.irrodl.org/index.php/irrodl/article/viewArticle/523/1103 Connectivism: Learning theory of the future or vestige of the past?] Rita Kop, Adrian Hill. In "The International Review of Research in Open and Distance Learning", Vol 9, No 3 (2008), {{ISSN|1492-3831}}&lt;/ref&gt; conclude that while it does not seem that connectivism is a separate learning theory, it "continues to play an important role in the development and emergence of new pedagogies, where control is shifting from the tutor to an increasingly more autonomous learner."

AlDahdouh&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; examined the relation between connectivism and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and the results, unexpectedly, revealed that ANN researchers use constructivism principles to teach ANN with labeled training data.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; However, he argued that connectivism principles are used to teach ANN only when the knowledge is unknown.

Ally recognizes that the world has changed and become more networked, so learning theories developed prior to these global changes are less relevant. However, he argues that, "What is needed is not a new stand-alone theory for the digital age, but a model that integrates the different theories to guide the design of online learning materials.".&lt;ref name="Ally"&gt;[http://www.aupress.ca/index.php/books/120146 Foundations of Educational Theory for Online Learning]. In ''The Theory and Practice of Online Learning'', Terry Anderson, Ed., May 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Chatti notes that Connectivism misses some concepts, which are crucial for learning, such as reflection, learning from failures, error detection and correction, and inquiry. He introduces the Learning as a Network (LaaN) theory which builds upon connectivism, complexity theory, and double-loop learning. LaaN starts from the learner and views learning as the continuous creation of a personal knowledge network (PKN).&lt;ref&gt;Mohamed Amine Chatti: The LaaN Theory. In: Personalization in Technology Enhanced Learning: A Social Software Perspective. Aachen, Germany: Shaker Verlag, 2010, pp. 19-42. http://mohamedaminechatti.blogspot.de/2013/01/the-laan-theory.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Coptology''' is the science of [[Copt]]ic studies, the study of Coptic language and literature.&lt;ref name="We"&gt;[http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2004/704/he1.htm Alahram weekly] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070917024209/http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2004/704/he1.htm |date=September 17, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
The European interest in Coptology may have started as early as the 15th century AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Copts and the West, 1439-1822: The European Discovery of the Egyptian Church|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Ho-IXrFvyq8C&amp;pg=PA141&amp;lpg=PA141&amp;dq=history+of+coptology&amp;source=web&amp;ots=u_afXTuU5Q&amp;sig=qG1qijWJuplcAVA7gZrf4_9OSGA|publisher = OUP Oxford|date = 2006-07-27|isbn = 9780199288779|language = en|first = Alastair|last = Hamilton}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was used in 1976 when the First International Congress of Coptology was held in [[Cairo]] under the title "Colloquium on the Future of Coptic Studies" (11-17 December). This was followed by the establishment of the "[[International Association for Coptic Studies]]".&lt;ref name="Int"&gt; [http://rmcisadu.let.uniroma1.it/~iacs/  International Association for Coptic Studies] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110201011732/http://rmcisadu.let.uniroma1.it/~iacs/ |date=2011-02-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the founders of the Colloquium and the Association was [[Pahor Labib]], director of the [[Coptic Museum]] in [[Cairo]] during 1951-65. The words 'Coptology' and 'Coptologist' were introduced into the English language by [[Aziz Suryal Atiya]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Amazon.com: Online Shopping for Electronics, Apparel, Computers, Books, DVDs &amp; more|url = https://www.amazon.com/gp/richpub/syltguides/fullview/PN1YR1HMUGAQ|accessdate = 2015-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Worldwide institutions==
There are now institutions that give more or less regular courses of Coptology in 47 countries around the world, including Australia, Great Britain, Canada, Germany, Israel, Spain, Switzerland, and the United States. A rotating chair of Coptic studies was opened at the [[American University in Cairo]] in 2002.&lt;ref name="We"/&gt;

The '''Department of Musicology''' is an institute of [[Palacký University]] [[Palacký University of Olomouc#Philosophy|Faculty of Philosophy]], which conducts research and provides education in the fields of [[musicology]] and [[Fine art#Academic study|fine art]]. While the Faculty of Philosophy dates back to 1576 and has provided education for a number of [[Aesthetics|art theorists]], the separate Department of Musicology was established in 1946. It is sited in the building of University Art Centre (former Jesuit College), together with other two art departments of Faculty of Philosophy and two art departments of [[Palacký University of Olomouc#Education|Faculty of Education]].

==History==
Established in 1573, the [[Palacký University of Olomouc]] has a long history of musical scholarship. Olomouc prominently excels in the sphere of [[classical music]] ([[Jacobus Gallus|J. H. Gallus]], [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|W. A. Mozart]], [[Antonín Dvořák|A. Dvořák]], [[Gustav Mahler|G. Mahler]], [[Jan Kubelík|J. Kubelík]], [[Ema Destinová|E. Destinová]], who all spent some part of their lives in Olomouc). Among the Olomouc University graduates are both [[Aesthetics|art theorists]] ([[Karel Slavíček]], [[Raphael Georg Kiesewetter]], [[Rudolf Eitelberger]], etc.) as well as composers ([[Pavel Vranický]], [[Pavel Křížkovský]], [[Eduard Schön]], [[Emil Viklický]], etc.).

The modern tradition of musicological research and education goes back to 1946 when the ''Institute of Music Education and Science'' was established at the [[Palacký University of Olomouc#Philosophy|Faculty of Philosophy]] by [[Robert Smetana]] (1904–1988). 1960’s &amp; 70’s saw a strong growth of the department (since 1972 led by [[Vladimír Hudec]]; however, the institute was  transformed into the ''Department of Music Education'' and transferred to the [[Palacký University of Olomouc#Education|Faculty of Education]] in 1980 by the decision of the Ministry of Education.

Soon after the [[Velvet revolution|fall of the communist régime]] in 1989, the [[musicology]] returned to the ground of Philosophical Faculty, this time as part of the ''Department of Combined Art Studies''. Independent '''Department of Musicology''' was renewed in 1992 and through the enthusiasm of excellent professionals grew into a modern academic institution. Since 2002 it is sited in the ''University Art Centre'', former Jesuit College building, together with another two art departments of the Faculty of Philosophy and two art departments of the Faculty of Education.

==Current Research Objectives &amp; Other Activities==
Research has a fundamental role for the Department. The Department hosts the annual ''International Musicological Conference'' (usually late November) and regular public workshops and seminars which are enriched by occasional activities such as conference on ''Zdeněk Fibich - the 19th Century Middle European Composer'' held in spring 2010.

The Department’s activities embrace a wide variety of modes of research (Regional and [[History|Historical Studies]], [[Organology]], [[Critical Edition of Musical Sources]], [[Jazz]], [[Art Rock]], [[Film Music]], and so on). Department’s research is  supported by a major funds from the [[European Union]] and [[Politics of the Czech Republic|Czech Government]] (principal among these are the ''Correspondence of Vítězslav Novák between 1890-1905'', ''Correspondence of Vítězslav Novák between 1906-1949'', ''Zdeněk Fibich’s 19th century Operas'', ''Moravia and the World'' ...). Department participated on ''Music Media Training Programme For the Czech Republic (1995 - 1998)'' and ''Musical Life in Europe (1997 - 2001)''. Since 1997 the Department is linked to [[Saint Cloud State University]] through the ''Art and Music in the Czech Republic Programme''.

The Department also benefits from a number of collaborative research and educational partnerships, including those with

'''Design and technology''' ('''D&amp;T''') is a school subject offered at all levels of primary and secondary school in England. It is used so children develop a range of designing skills and technology skills for example, using media to design their project and a saw to cut items. It first appeared as a titled subject in the first [[National Curriculum (England, Wales and Northern Ireland)|National Curriculum of England, Wales and Northern Ireland]] in 1988&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/758394547|title=Debates in design and technology education|others=Owen-Jackson, Gwyneth, 1956-|isbn=9780415689045|location=London|oclc=758394547}}&lt;/ref&gt;. D&amp;T, or a similar form, has been taught in many countries around the world such as [[India]], United States, Australia, New Zealand, Ireland, Malta, China, South Africa, France and Finland &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/470685647|title=International handbook of research and development in technology education|date=2009|publisher=Sense Publishers|others=Jones, Alister., Vries, Marc J. de, 1958-, Buntting, Cathy M.|isbn=9789087908775|location=Rotterdam|oclc=470685647}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Many international schools teach design and technology. As a school subject it involves students in designing in a practical context using a range or materials and media. It is also a university course in many countries, including Australia, Canada, the US, Singapore, South Africa, Netherlands and New Zealand, both for the preparation of teachers and for general education in areas such as [[industrial design]]. Some of the UK universities which deliver courses include: [[University of Brighton|Brighton]], [[Sheffield Hallam University|Sheffield Hallam]], [[Goldsmiths, University of London|Goldsmiths' College]] and [[Greenwich University|Greenwich]].

== Design and Technology qualifications ==

=== GCSE ===
With the first National Curriculum new [[General Certificate of Secondary Education|GCSE qualifications]] were introduced for D&amp;T in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Unlike the National Curriculum the previous subject titles were retained (e.g. [[craft, design and technology]] (CDT) and [[home economics]]) and others added (e.g. electronics, food technology, textiles technology and systems and control). These GCSE specifications had two assessed components:

* 40% of the final mark for  coursework
* 60% for an examination of general subject knowledge (materials, processes, techniques and sustainability etc.).

GCSE D&amp;T titles available included:

*GCSE Design and Technology: Electronic Products
*GCSE Design and Technology: Food Technology
*GCSE Design and Technology: Graphic Products
*GCSE Design and Technology: Resistant Materials
*GCSE Design and Technology: [[Systems and Control]]
*GCSE Design and Technology: Textiles Technology
*GCSE Design and Technology: Product Design

=== GCSE D&amp;T (2017 onwards) ===
Since September 2017&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/gcse-design-and-technology|title=GCSE design and technology|last=|first=|date=4 November 2015|website=Gov.uk|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=28 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; a new GCSE has been taught in England that incorporates all material areas (with the exception of food which is now a separate GCSE&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/gcse-food-preparation-and-nutrition|title=GCSE Food preparation and nutrition|last=|first=|date=20 February 2015|website=Gov.uk|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=28 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;).  Similar to the previous GCSE, the new [[GCSE Specifications|specifications]] have two assessed components - an exam and a non-examined assessment (NEA) but with a 50:50 split of the marks. 

=== A level ===
[[Advanced Level (UK)|A and AS level]] examinations prepare students for individualised learning and problem solving, which is essential in business and industry. Time management is a key factor to candidates' success within the coursework elements of the qualification. The examinations are as rigorous as any other subject. Indeed, due to the complexity and variety of tasks and organisation skills required this examination and course is very demanding. The subject covers activities from [[Control engineering|control]] technology to aesthetic product design. Students have to use all types of computer software including [[computer-aided design]] and [[Computer-aided manufacturing|manufacture]], [[spreadsheet]]s and computer presentations.  Outputs from such work are often sent to [[CNC]] machines for manufacture.

== International Baccalaureate ==
IB Design Technology (DT) is an elective subject offered in many [[International Baccalaureate]] schools globally. Design is also offered in the [[IB Middle Years Programme]] as a compulsory subject for grades 6–10, and at the [[IB Diploma Programme|Diploma Programme]] level (grades 11-12). IB Design Technology is very similar in content to ''Design Technology'', which is widely offered in the national curricula of [[Education in England|England]], [[Education in Australia|Australia]], [[Education in Canada|Canada]], [[Education in New Zealand|New Zealand]] and many African nations. It is one of the [[IB Group 4 subjects|Group 4 sciences]].

The primary focus of MYP Design is to give students an understanding of the [[design cycle]], through a practical programme. The student will complete projects based on solving a real and authentic problem. Students document their progress as they follow the design cycle to come to a feasible solution. They create the solution and then evaluate it following thorough testing.

The Diploma Programme of Design Technology is a two-year introduction to designing, a range of fundamentals of technology, and global technological issues. It provides students with the knowledge to be able to design and make in school workshops, and also to develop an informed literacy about technology in general. Because it is an international curriculum it has a particular focus on global environmental issues. It covers core topics in human factors and ergonomics, resource management and sustainable production, modeling, raw materials to final production,  innovation and design, classic design. It covers advanced higher level topics in user centered design, sustainability, innovation and markets, and commercial production. The diploma is accepted for university entrance in many countries, and is a good preparation for careers in areas such as engineering, architecture, product design, interior design, design and education.

== Scotland ==

== Awards ==
In the UK, the [[Arkwright Scholarships Trust]] awards two-year scholarships to students who are taking GCSE/Scottish Standard Grade in design &amp; technology. The Arkwright Engineering Scholarships support students through their A levels/Scottish Highers and encourage them to study engineering or a related area of design at a top university or through a high-quality industrial apprenticeship.

The '''national emblem of Yemen''' depicts a golden [[eagle (heraldry)|eagle]] with a scroll between its claws.  On the scroll is written the name of the country in {{lang-ar|الجمهورية اليمنية}} or {{transl|ar|''Al-Jumhuriyyah Al-Yamaniyah''}} ("The Yemeni Republic"). The chest of the eagle contains a shield that depicts a coffee plant and the [[Marib Dam]], with seven blue wavy stripes below. The flagstaffs on the right and left of the eagle hold the [[Flag of Yemen]].

==Historical emblems==

===North Yemen===
From 1945 to 1990, [[Yemen]] was split into [[Yemen Arab Republic|North]] and [[People's Democratic Republic of Yemen|South]]. The North had an emblem more similar to the present day one, and its shield has similarities with the shield of the former [[Mutawakkilite Kingdom of Yemen]].

&lt;/gallery&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

===South Yemen===
The South had an emblem with the pan-Arab "[[Eagle of Saladin]]" (similar to the coats of arms of [[Coat of arms of Egypt|Egypt]], [[Coat of arms of Iraq|Iraq]], and the former coats of arms of [[Coat of arms of Libya|Libya]] and [[Coat of arms of Syria|Syria]]).

'''Extended matching items/questions''' ('''EMI''' or '''EMQ''') are a written examination format similar to [[multiple choice]] questions but with one key difference, that they test knowledge in a far more applied, in depth, sense.

It is often used in [[medical education]] and other healthcare subject areas to test [[diagnostic reasoning]].

== Structure ==
[[Image:EMQ example page 1.JPG|500px|left|EMQ example]]
[[Image:EMQ example page 2.JPG|500px|right|EMQ example]]
{{-}}
'''The structure has three key elements:'''

;Answer option list
:Sources suggest using a minimum of eight answer options to a [[ratio]] of five [[scenario]]s or [[Vignette (literature)|vignettes]] to ensure that the probability of getting the correct answer by chance remains reasonably low.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nbme.org/publications/item-writing-manual-download.html&lt;/ref&gt;. The exact number of answer options should be dictated by the logical number of realistic options. This ensures that the test item has [[Authentication|authenticity]] and [[Validity (logic)|validity]].
;Lead in question
:This should be as specific as possible and on reading the lead in question it should be understand exactly what the student needs to do - without needing to look at the answer options. If you need to look at the answers to understand the question, the item has not been well written.
;Two or more scenarios or vignettes
:There should be at least two vignettes, otherwise this becomes an [[Multiple choice question|MCQ]]. Because the item allows for an in depth test of knowledge each of the scenarios should be related to one another by a theme that summarises the question overall. Each scenario should be roughly similar in structure and content, and each has one 'best' answer from amongst the series of answer options given.

== Research evidence ==
[[Image:Frequency correct answers EMQ vs MCQ.JPG|thumb|300px|Case and Swanson 1989]]
Students sitting this test item format have a greater chance of answering incorrectly if they cannot synthesise and apply their knowledge as shown through the work of Susan Case and David Swanson (1989).

Evidence suggests that this format works best when there is a single best answer to each successive [[scenario]] or vignette.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nbme.org/publications/item-writing-manual-download.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other variants==
There are some instances where EMIs do not follow the evidence based format. These other uses of the term have been criticised as they do not apply the key principles of the EMQ as stated above.[http://www.nbme.org/publications/item-writing-manual-download.html] E.g. a question where two lists are offered, one of terms and one of descriptions is often referred to as an EMI.

'''Example of an EMI variant'''

* This organelle stores the genetic information of a eukaryotic cell.
* This organelle synthesises polypeptides using information provided by mRNA.
* This organelle, found in plants, contains chlorophyll.

'''List of options'''
# Chloroplast
# Mitochondrion
# Lysosome
# Nucleus
# Endoplasmic reticulum
# Peroxisome
# Golgi apparatus
# Ribosome

'''Answer Key'''

# 4
# 8
# 1

'''M. Hercule Flambeau''' is a fictional character created by English novelist [[G. K. Chesterton]], who appears in 48 [[short story|short stories]] about the character [[Father Brown]].  A master criminal, his surname "Flambeau" is an alias, the French word for a flaming torch.

He first appeared in the story "[[The Blue Cross (short story)|The Blue Cross]]" as a jewel thief. Father Brown foiled his attempted crimes in this and several other stories.  As a notorious and elusive criminal, Flambeau is a worry for law-enforcers. He is exposed by Father Brown, and later becomes a detective himself. His last appearance as a thief occurs in "The Flying Stars", in which Father Brown persuades him to return his loot and to give up the criminal life.  As a reformed criminal, Flambeau assists Father Brown in a number of other short stories, beginning with "The Invisible Man".

Although Brown and Flambeau spend much of the day together in "The Blue Cross", when they meet again in "[[The Queer Feet]]", Brown recognizes Flambeau but the thief has no recollection of the priest.

Flambeau is an idiosyncratic character.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}  Conventional detective fiction{{weasel-inline|date=August 2014}} often splits humanity into the "good" and the "bad",{{or|date=August 2014}} but the priest sees things in a more graduated light, and considers the possibility of redemption.  He becomes Flambeau's friend before he reforms him, and uses this friendship to transform him. In "The Secret of Flambeau", Flambeau credits Father Brown for his reformation when he says, "Have I not heard the sermons of the righteous? [&amp;hellip;] Do you think all that ever did anything but make me laugh? Only my friend told me that he knew exactly why I stole, and I have never stolen since."

Flambeau's fate is revealed in "The Secret of Father Brown". Retiring as a detective, he marries and settles in a Spanish castle, raises a large family and lives in a blissful state of domesticity. Flambeau gives up his assumed name and returns to using his birth name, Duroc.

Flambeau has appeared in several film, television and radio adaptations. Actors who have portrayed him include:

*[[Paul Lukas]] – ''[[Father Brown, Detective]]'' (1934 film)
*[[Bill Griffis]] – ''[[The Adventures of Father Brown]]'' (1945 radio series)
*[[Peter Finch]] – ''[[Father Brown (film)|Father Brown]]''/''The Detective'' (US title) (1954 film)
*[[Siegfried Lowitz]] – ''[[Das schwarze Schaf]]'' (''The Black Sheep'') (1960 film) 
*[[Dennis Burgess]] – [[Father Brown (1974 TV series)|''Father Brown'' (1974 TV series)]]
*[[Olivier Pierre]] – ''[[Father Brown Stories]]'' (1984–1986 BBC Radio series)
*[[John Light (actor)|John Light]] – [[Father Brown (2013 TV series)|''Father Brown'' (2013 TV series)]] (Episodes: 1.10 "The Blue Cross", 2.5 "The Mysteries of the Rosary", 3.10 "The Judgment of Man", 4.5 "The Daughter of Autolycus", 5.15 "The Penitent Man", 6.10 "The Two Deaths of Hercule Flambeau'''"''')

'''Hunterheugh Crags''' are part of the Fellsandstone escarpment, {{convert|5|mi|0}} north west of [[Alnwick]], [[Northumberland]], [[England]] and {{convert|9|mi|0}} from the coast. The site is [[moorland]] forming part of the [[Bewick and Beanley Moors SSSI]], although prior to the Bronze Age it is likely to have been thickly forested with [[broadleaf]] [[deciduous]] trees. This site is most famous for the [[cup and ring mark]] art present on the outcrop.

==Place-name meaning==
Hunterheugh derives from Old English ''huntor'' "[[hunting|hunter]]" and ''hoh'' "hill-spur".

== Rock art ==
The first phase of the carvings is all on the natural rock surface and these are now very heavily weathered. The motifs incorporate undulations of the surface into their design so that most are connected to each other by artificial grooves or by a natural rock slope which allows water to flow from one design to the next. This phase is believed to be [[Neolithic]], and probably early Neolithic at that. This is supported by the discovery of what appears to be a broken sandstone axehead 1.2 m from the carved rock outcrop at the base of the topsoil. Such ground and polished axeheads are known from elsewhere in [[Northumberland]].

Phase 1 of the carvings was broken through when the rock dome was quarried at a later date. New carvings were then made on the surfaces exposed by quarrying. These show no attempt to take undulations and variations in the rock (with one exception), none of the designs are inter-connected, and the shapes are more varied and more crudely executed. This phase is believed to be Early [[Bronze Age]] in date and appears to imitate the earlier tradition, but does not share the same sense of positioning.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="55764">In [[media studies]], [[media psychology]], [[communication theory]] and [[sociology]], '''media influence''' and '''media effects''' are topics relating to [[mass media]] and [[media culture]] effects on individual or audience thought, attitudes and behavior.

The influence of mass media has an effect on many aspects of the human life. This can include: voting a certain way, individual views and beliefs, or even false information that can skew a persons knowledge of a specific topic. Media is an ever-changing field and is being critiqued now more than ever by the general public. The overall influence of mass media has increased drastically over the years, and will continue to do so as the media itself improves.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Media influence is the actual force exerted by a media message, resulting in either a change or reinforcement in audience or individual beliefs. Media effects are measurable effects that result from media influence or a media message. Whether that media message has an effect on any of its audience members is contingent on many factors, including audience demographics and psychological characteristics. These effects can be positive or negative, abrupt or gradual, short-term or long-lasting. Not all effects result in change: some media messages reinforce an existing belief. Researchers examine an audience after media exposure for changes in cognition, belief systems, and attitudes, as well as emotional, physiological and behavioral effects.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Media Effects|date=2012-01-03|publisher=SAGE Publications, Inc|isbn=9781412964692|edition=60502nd|pages=35–63}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

There are several scholarly definitions of media. Bryant and Zillmann defined media effects as "the social, cultural, and psychological impact of communicating via the mass media".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Perspectives on Media Effects|date=1989-09-01|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9780805807219|page=xiii}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perse stated that media effects researchers study "how to control, enhance, or mitigate the impact of the mass media on individuals and society".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IjqRAgAAQBAJ|title=Media Effects and Society|last=Perse|first=Elizabeth M.|date=2001-01-01|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781135686796|page=ix}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lang stated media effects researchers study "what types of content, in what type of medium, affect which people, in what situations".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lang, A.|date=2013|title=Discipline in crisis? The shifting paradigm of mass communication research|url=|journal=Communication Theory |volume=23 |issue=1 |pages= 10–24|doi=10.1111/comt.12000|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Media effects studies have undergone several phases, often corresponding to the development of mass media technologies.

=== Powerful media effects phase ===
From the early 20th century to the 1930s, developing mass media technologies, such as radio and film, were credited with an almost irresistible power to mold an audience's beliefs, cognition and behaviors according to the communicators' will.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7_eyvmCjzkoC|title=McQuail's Mass Communication Theory|last=McQuail|first=Denis|date=2010-03-12|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=9781849202923|pages=456–460}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Bauer, R.A.  |author2=Bauer, A. |lastauthoramp=yes |date=1960|title=America, mass society and mass media|url=|journal=Journal of Social Issues |volume=16 |issue=3 |pages=3–66|doi=10.1111/j.1540-4560.1960.tb00953.x|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The basic assumption of strong media effects theory was that audiences were passive and [[Homogeneity and heterogeneity|homogeneous]]. This assumption was not based on [[empirical evidence]] but on assumptions of human nature. There were two main explanations for this perception of mass media effects. First, mass broadcasting technologies were acquiring a widespread audience, even among average households. People were astonished by the speed of information dissemination, which may have clouded audience perception of any media effects. Secondly, [[propaganda]] techniques were implemented during the war time by several governments as a powerful tool for uniting their people. This propaganda exemplified strong-effect communication. Early media effects research often focused on the power of this propaganda (e.g., [[Harold Lasswell|Lasswell]], 1927&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Propaganda technique in the world war|last=Lasswell|publisher=M.I.T. Press|year=1927|isbn=|location=Cambridge, MA|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Combing through the technological and social environment, early media effects theories stated that the mass media were all-powerful.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=McQuail's mass communication theory|last=McQuail|first=Denis|publisher=SAGE Publications|year=2010|isbn=|location=London|page=458}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Representative theories:
* [[Hypodermic needle model]],  or magic bullet theory: Considers the audience to be targets of an injection or bullet of information fired from the pistol of mass media. The audience are unable to avoid or resist the injection or bullets.

=== Limited media effects phase ===
Starting in the 1930s, the second phase of media effects studies instituted the importance of empirical research, while introducing the complex nature of media effects due to the idiosyncratic nature of audience individuals.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The [[Payne Fund Studies|Payne Fund studies]], conducted in the United States during this period, focused on the effect of media upon young people. Many other separate studies focused on persuasion effects studies, or the possibilities and usage of planned persuasion in film and other media. [[Carl Hovland|Hovland]] et al. (1949) conducted a series of experimental studies to evaluate the effects of using films to indoctrinate American military recruits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Experiments in Mass Communication|last=Hovland|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1949|isbn=|location=Princeton, NJ|pages=|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul Lazarsfeld|Lazarsfeld]] (1944) and his colleagues' effectiveness studies of democratic election campaigns launched political campaign effect studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=People's choice|last=Larzarsfeld|publisher=Duell, Sloan and Pearce|year=1944|isbn=|location=New York, NY|pages=|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers uncovered mounting empirical evidence of the idiosyncratic nature of media effects on individuals and audiences, identifying numerous intervening variables, such as demographic attributes, social psychological factors, and different media use behaviors. With these new variables added to research, it was difficult to isolate media influence that resulted in any media effects to an audience's cognition, attitude and behavior. As Berelson (1959) summed up in a widely quoted conclusion: "Some kinds of communication on some kinds of issues have brought to the attention of some kinds of people under some kinds of conditions have some kinds of effect."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Berelson, B.|date=1959|title=The state of communication research|url=|journal=Public Opinion Quarterly |volume=23 |issue=1 |pages=1–2 |doi=10.1086/266840|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the concept of an all-powerful mass media was diluted, this did not determine that the media lacked influence or effect. Instead, the pre-existing structure of social relationships and cultural contexts were believed to primarily shape or change people's opinions, attitudes and behaviors, and media merely function within these established processes. This complexity had a dampening effect upon media effects studies.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

Representative theories:
* [[Two-step flow of communication]]: Discusses the indirect effects of media, stating that people are affected by media through the interpersonal influence of opinion leaders.
* [[Selective exposure theory|Klapper's selective exposure theory]]: Joseph T. Klapper asserts in his book, ''The Effects Of Mass Communication,'' that audiences are not passive targets of any communication contents. Instead, audiences selectively choose content that is aligned with previously held convictions.

=== Rediscovered powerful media effects phase ===
Limited media effect theory was challenged by new evidence supporting that mass media messages could indeed lead to measurable social effects.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Lang and Lang (1981) argued that the widespread acceptance of limited media effect theory was unwarranted, and that "the evidence available by the end of the 1950s, even when balanced against some of the negative findings, gives no justification for an overall verdict of 'media importance.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Lang, G.|author2=Lang, K.|lastauthoramp=yes |date=1981|title=Mass communication and public opinion: strategies for research|url=|journal=Social Psychology: Sociological Perspective |pages=653–82|doi=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1950s and 1960s, widespread use of television indicated its unprecedented power on social lives. Meanwhile, researchers also realized that early investigations, relying heavily on psychological models, were narrowly focused on only short-term and immediate effects. The "stimuli-reaction" model introduced the possibility of profound long-term media effects. The shift from short-term to long-term effect studies marked the renewal of media effects research. More attention was paid to collective cultural patterns, definitions of social reality, ideology and institutional behavior. Though audiences were still considered in control of the selection of media messages they consumed, "the way media select, process and shape content for their own purposes can have a strong influence on how it is received and interpreted and thus on longer-term consequences" (Mcquail, 2010).&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

Representative theories:
* [[Agenda-setting theory]]: Describes how topics selection and the frequencies of reporting by the mass media affected the perceived salience of those topics within the public audience.
* [[Framing (social sciences)|Framing]]: Identifies the media's ability to manipulate audience interpretation of a media message through careful control of angles, facts, opinions, amount of coverage.
* [[Knowledge gap hypothesis|Knowledge-gap theory]]: States the long-term influence of mass media on people's socioeconomic status with the hypothesis that "as the infusion of mass media information into a social system increases, higher socioeconomic status segments tend to acquire this information faster than lower socioeconomic status population segments causing the gap in knowledge between the two to increase rather than decrease".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tichenor|first=P. J.|last2=Donohue|first2=G. A.|last3=Olien|first3=C. N.|date=1970-06-20|title=Mass Media Flow and Differential Growth in Knowledge|url=http://poq.oxfordjournals.org/content/34/2/159|journal=Public Opinion Quarterly|volume=34|issue=2|pages=159–170|doi=10.1086/267786|issn=0033-362X}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Cultivation theory]]: As an audience engages in media messages, particularly on television, they infer the portrayed world upon the real world.

=== Negotiated media effects phase ===
In the late 1970s, researchers examined the media's role in shaping social realities, also referred to as "social constructivist" (Gamson and Modigliani, 1989).&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Gamson, W.  |author2=Modigliani, A. |lastauthoramp=yes |date=1989|title=Media discourse and public opinion on nuclear power, a constructivist approach|url=|journal=American Journal of Sociology |volume=95 |issue= |pages=1–37|doi=10.1086/229213|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This approach evaluated the media's role in constructing meaning, and corresponding social realities. First, the media formats images of society in a patterned and predictable way, both in news and entertainment. Second, audiences construct or derive their perception of actual social reality—and their role in it—by interacting with the media-constructed realities. Individuals in these audiences can control their interaction and interpretation of these media-constructed realities. However, when media messages are the only information source, the audience may implicitly accept the media-constructed reality. Alternatively, they may choose to derive their social reality from other sources, such as first-hand experience or cultural environment.

This phase also added [[Qualitative research|qualitative]] and [[Ethnography|ethnographic research methods]] to existing [[quantitative research|quantitative]] and [[Behaviorism|behaviorist research]] methods. Additionally, several research projects focused on media effects surrounding media coverage of [[Minority influence|minority and fringe social movements]].&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

Representative research:
* Van Zoonen's research (1992): Examines the mass media contribution to the women's movement in The Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=van Zoonen, L.|date=1992|title=The women's movement and the media: constructing a public identity|url=|journal=European Journal of Communication|volume=7|issue=4|pages=453–76|doi=10.1177/0267323192007004002|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== New media environment phase ===
As early as the 1970s, research emerged on the effects of individual or group behavior in computer-mediated environments.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The focus was on the effect of [[computer-mediated communication]] (CMC) in interpersonal and group interaction. Early research examined the social interactions and impressions that CMC partners formed of each other, given the restrictive characteristics of CMC—such as the anonymity or lack of nonverbal (auditory or visual) cues.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Valkenburg, Peter, &amp; Walther|date=2016|title=Media Effects: Theory and Research|journal=Annual Review of Psychology|volume=67|pages=315–338|pmid=26331344|doi=10.1146/annurev-psych-122414-033608}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first generation of CMC researches simply compared existing "text-only" internet content (e.g. emails) to face-to-face communication (Culnan &amp; Markus,1987).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Handbook of Organizational Communication: An Interdisciplinary Perspective|vauthors=Culnan MJ, Markus ML |publisher=Sage|year=1987|isbn=|location=Thousand Oaks, CA:|pages=420–443}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Daft and Lengel (1986) developed the [[media richness theory]] to assess the media's ability of reproducing information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Daft RL, Lengel RH |date=1986|title=Organizational information requirements, media richness and structural design|url=|journal=Manag. Sci. |volume=32 |issue= 5|pages=554–71|doi=10.1287/mnsc.32.5.554|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The internet was widely adopted for personal use in the 1990s, further expanding CMC studies. Theories such as [[Social information processing (theory)|social information processing]] (Walther, 1992)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Walther, J. B.|date=1992|title=Interpersonal effects in computer-mediated interaction: a relational perspective|url=|journal=Commun. Res. |volume=19 |issue= |pages=52–90|doi=10.1177/009365092019001003|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and  social identification/deindividuation (SIDE) model (Postmes et al. 2000)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=SIDE Issues Centre Stage: Recent Developments in Studies of De-individuation in Groups|vauthors=Postmes T, Lea M, Spears R, Reicher SD |publisher=KNAW|year=2000|isbn=|location=Amsterdam|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; studied CMC effects on users' behavior, comparing these effects to [[Face-to-face interaction|face-to-face communication]] effects. With the emergence of dynamic [[user-generated content]] on websites and social media platforms, research results are even more conducive to CMC studies. For instance, Valkenburg &amp; Peter (2009) developed the internet-enhanced self-disclosure hypothesis among adolescents, stating that social media platforms are primarily used to maintain real-life friendships among young people. Therefore, this media use may enhance the friendships.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Valkenburg PM, Peter J |date=2009|title=The effects of instant messaging on the quality of adolescents' existing friendships: a longitudinal study|url=|journal=J. Commun. |volume=59 |issue= |pages=79–97|doi=10.1111/j.1460-2466.2008.01405.x|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt; New CMC technologies are evolving at a rapid pace, calling for new media effects theories.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

=== Media Influences on People ===
The media has an influence that seemingly effects us all in different ways. The entertainment media can influence the way we think because we turn to it for relief from the stress and anxiety of everyday life .&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.lds.org/liahona/2016/09/young-adults/no-neutral-ground-how-media-influences-us?lang=eng|title=No Neutral Ground: How Media Influences Us - liahona|website=www.lds.org|access-date=2018-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most important things about media and its influence, is learning how to remain in control of the changes it could have on our life. Media can be either positive or negative, and that includes the influence that can be exerted on us. &lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Whether we know it or not, media takes a toll on all of our lives. This could include the influences and the way we think about something that is political, economic, or even religious, the medias agenda will always be pushed on the general public, no matter the type of media. If we look at media from a closed mindset, people are much less likely to be skewed by the media's message to the viewers, rather than if you have no idea about what you are viewing and believe everything that is heard on television or seen on the internet. People who tend to consume a high amount of media should remember that mass media influence is real and can affect peoples' minds, behaviors, and even attitudes. &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Typology ==
The broad scope of media effects studies creates an organizational challenge. Organizing media effects by their targeted audience type, either on an individual (micro-level) or an audience aggregate (macro-level), is one effective method. [[Denis McQuail]], a prominent communication theorist, organized effects into a graph.

=== Micro- versus macro-level media effects ===
Media effects studies target either an individual (micro-level) or an audience aggregate (macro-level).

==== Micro-level ====
Theories that base their observations and conclusions on individual media users rather than on groups, institutions, systems, or society at large.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Valkenburheueg, P. M., Peter, J., &amp; Walther, J. B.|date=2016|title=Media Effects: Theory and Research|url=|journal=Annual Review of Psychology |volume=67 |issue= |pages= 315–338|doi=10.1146/annurev-psych-122414-033608|pmid=26331344}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Representative theories: [[Elaboration likelihood model]], [[Social cognitive theory]] of mass communication, [[Framing (social sciences)|Framing]] theory, [[Priming (media)|Priming]] theory, etc.

On a micro-level, individuals can be affected six different ways.
# ''Cognitive'' This is the most apparent and measurable effect: includes any new information, meaning or message acquired through [[media consumption]]. Cognitive effects extend past knowledge acquisition: individuals can identify patterns, combine information sources and infer information into new behaviors.
# ''Beliefs'' We cannot validate every single media message, yet we might choose to believe many of the messages, even about events, people, places and ideas that we have never encountered first-hand.
# ''Attitudes'' Media messages, regardless of intention, often trigger judgments or attitudes about the presented topics.
# ''Affect'' Refers to any emotional effect, positive or negative, on an individual from media exposure.
# ''Physiological'' Media content may trigger an automatic physical reaction, often manifested in fight-or-flight response or dilated pupils.
# ''Behaviors'' Researchers measure an individual's obvious response and engagement with media content, measuring any change or reinforcement in behaviors.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Macro-level

Theories that base their observations and conclusions on large social groups, institutions, systems or ideologies.
&lt;br /&gt;
Representative theories: [[Knowledge gap hypothesis|Knowledge gap]] theory, [[Risk management|Risk communication]], [[Public sphere|Public sphere theory]] in Communication, etc.

=== McQuail's typology ===
[[File:Mcquail's typology of media effects.jpg|thumb|Figure 1: McQuail's typology of media effects]]
[[Denis McQuail]], a prominent communication theorist, organized effects into a graph according to the media effect's intentionality (planned or unplanned) and time duration (short-term or long-term). See Figure 1.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Key media effects theories ==
=== Micro-level media effects ===
The following are salient examples of media effects studies which examine media influence on individuals.

==== Third-person ====
Individuals often mistakenly believe that they are less susceptible to media effects than others. About fifty percent of the members in a given sample are susceptible to the [[third-person effect]], underestimating their degree of influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mass Media Effects Research: Advances Through Meta-Analysis|date=2006-08-31|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9780805849998|pages=82, 55}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can allow an individual to complain about media effects without taking responsibility for their own possible effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Media Effects|date=2012-01-03|publisher=SAGE Publications, Inc|isbn=9781412964692|edition=60502nd|pages=73, 76}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is largely based on [[Attribution (psychology)|attribution theory]], where "the person tends to attribute his own reactions to the object world, and those of another, when they differ from his own, to personal characteristics."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=tVFmY0xvn-wC&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=heider+psychology+of+interpersonal+relations#v=snippet&amp;q=attribute%2520his%2520own%2520reactions&amp;f=false|title=The Psychology of Interpersonal Relations|last=Heider|first=F.|date=2013-05-13|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-1134922185|page=157}}&lt;/ref&gt; Standley (1994) tested the third-person effect and attribution theory, reporting people are more likely offer situational reasons for television's effect upon themselves, while offering dispositional reasons for other members of an audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l1RlNwAACAAJ|title=Linking Third Person Effect and Attribution Theory|last=Standley|first=Tracy Collins|date=1994-01-01|publisher=Southern Methodist University.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Priming ====
This is a concept derived from a network model of memory used in cognitive psychology. Information is stored in this model as nodes, clustered with related nodes by associated pathways. If one node is activated, nearby nodes are also activated. This is known as [[spreading activation]]. [[Priming (psychology)|Priming]] occurs when a node is activated, causing related nodes to stand by for possible activation. Both the intensity and amount of elapsed time from the moment of activation determine the strength and duration of the priming effect.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In media effects studies, [[Priming (media)|priming]] describes how exposure to media can alter an individual's attitudes, behaviors, or beliefs. Most [[media violence research]], a popular area of discussion in media effects studies, theorizes that exposure to violent acts may prime an individual to behave more aggressively while the activation lingers.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Social learning ====
Miller and Dollard (1941) pioneered [[social learning theory]] by their findings that individuals do not need to personally act out a behavior to learn it; they can learn from observation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/1942-00109-000|title=Social learning and imitation|author1=Miller, N.

==== Media violence ====
The effects of [[Media violence research|media violence]] upon individuals has many decades of research, starting as early as the 1920s. Children and adolescents, considered vulnerable media consumers, are often the target of these studies. Most studies of media violence surround the media categories of television and [[Video game controversies|video games]].

The rise of the motion picture industry, coupled with advances in social sciences, spurred the famous [[Payne Fund Studies|Payne Fund studies]] and others. Though the quality of the research has been called into question, one of the findings suggested a direct role between movies depicting delinquent adolescents and delinquent behaviors in adolescents. [[Fredric Wertham|Wertham]] (1954) later suggested that comic books influenced children into delinquent behaviors, provided false [[World view|worldviews]] and lowered literacy in his book ''[[Seduction of the Innocent]]''. This research was too informal to reach a clear verdict, and a recent study suggests information was misrepresented and even falsified, yet it led to public outcry resulting in many discontinued comic magazines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/1564874|title=Seducing the Innocent: Fredric Wertham and the Falsifications that Helped Condemn Comics|last=Tilley|first=Carol|website=www.academia.edu|publisher=Information and Culture: A Journal of History|publication-date=2013|access-date=2016-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Television's ubiquity in the 1950s generated more concerns. Since then, studies have hypothesized a number of effects.

''Behavioral effects'' include disinhibition, imitation and desensitization.
# [[Disinhibition]], a theory that exposure to violent media may legitimize the use of violence, has found support in many carefully controlled experiments. Men exposed to violent pornography behave more aggressively towards women in certain circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/comm/malamuth/pdf/81Jsi37.pdf|title=Rape Proclivity Among Males|last=Malamuth|first=Neil|date=|website=|publisher=Journal of Social Issues|publication-date=1981|access-date=March 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[Imitation|Imitation theory]] states individuals may learn violence from television characters. [[Albert Bandura|Bandura]]'s [[Bobo doll experiment]], along with other research, seems to indicate correlation even when controlling for individual differences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/dev/39/2/201/|title=Longitudinal relations between children's exposure to TV violence and their aggressive and violent behavior in young adulthood: 1977-1992|website=APA PsycNET|access-date=2016-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[Desensitization (psychology)|Desensitization]] refers to an individual's habituation to violence through exposure to violent media content, resulting in real-life implications. Studies have covered both television and video game violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Carnagey|first=Nicholas L.|last2=Anderson|first2=Craig A.|last3=Bushman|first3=Brad J.|date=2007-05-01|title=The effect of video game violence on physiological desensitization to real-life violence|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022103106000825|journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|volume=43|issue=3|pages=489–496|doi=10.1016/j.jesp.2006.05.003|citeseerx=10.1.1.112.7703}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Desensitization (psychology)|Desensitization]] has become an issue with Hollywood adaptations in regard to crimes. It is very easy for a movie to become caught up in making its films look artistic that they begin to make their audiences indifferent to the true horror that is taking place on screen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lovell|first=Jarret|date=Spring 2001|title=Crime and popular culture in the classroom: Approaches and resources for interrogating the obvious|url=|journal=Journal of Criminal Justice Education|volume=12|pages=229–244|via=Proquest|doi=10.1080/10511250100085141}}&lt;/ref&gt;
''Cognitive effects'' include an increased belief of potential violence in the real world from watching violent media content, leading to anxiety about personal safety.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Media Effects: Advances in Theory and Research|date=1994-01-03|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9780805809183|page=184}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Macro-level media effects ===
The following are salient examples of media effects studies which examine media influence on an audience aggregate.

==== Cultivation ====
Not all media effects are instantaneous or short-term. Gerbner (1969) created [[cultivation theory]], arguing that the media cultivates a "collective consciousness about elements of existence."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gerbner|first=George|date=1969-06-01|title=Toward "Cultural Indicators": The analysis of mass mediated public message systems|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02769102|journal=AV Communication Review|volume=17|issue=2|pages=137–148|doi=10.1007/BF02769102|issn=0001-2890|doi-broken-date=2018-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; If audiences are exposed to repetitive themes and storylines, over time, they may expect these themes and storylines mirrored in real life.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Agenda setting in the news ====
There are two primary areas of media [[Agenda-setting theory|agenda-setting]]: (i) the media tells us the news and (ii) tells us what to think about the news. Press coverage sends signals to audiences about the importance of mentioned issues, while [[Framing (social sciences)|framing]] the news induces the unsuspecting viewer into a particular response. Additionally, news that is not given press coverage often dissipates, not only because it lacks a vehicle of mass communication, but because individuals may not express their concerns for fear of ostracization; this further creates the [[spiral of silence]] effect.

===== Framing =====
News outlets can influence public opinion by controlling variables in news presentation. News gatherers curate facts to underscore a certain angle. Presentation method—such as time of broadcast, extent of coverage and choice of news medium—can also frame the message; this can create, replace or reinforce a certain viewpoint in an audience. Entman (2007) describes [[framing (social sciences)|framing]] as "the process of culling a few elements of perceived reality and assembling a narrative that highlights connections among them to promote a particular interpretation." Not only does the media identify supposed "causes of problems," it can "encourage moral judgments" and "promote favored policies."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Entman|first=Robert M.|date=2007-03-01|title=Framing Bias: Media in the Distribution of Power|journal=Journal of Communication|volume=57|issue=1|pages=163–173|doi=10.1111/j.1460-2466.2006.00336.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One long-term implication of framing, if the media reports news with a consistent favorable slant, is that it can lend a helping hand to certain overarching institutions of thought and related entities. It can reinforce [[capitalism]], [[patriarchy]], [[heterosexism]], [[individualism]], [[consumerism]], and [[white privilege]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qCl_6b6JkeoC|title=Consuming Environments: Television and Commercial Culture|last=Budd|first=Mike|last2=Craig|first2=Steve|last3=Steinman|first3=Clayton M.|date=1999-01-01|publisher=Rutgers University Press|isbn=9780813525921|page=175}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some theorize this bias may reinforce the political parties that espouse these [[Paradigm|thought paradigms]], although more empirical research is needed to substantiate these claims.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Media outlets contend that [[gatekeeping]], or news filtering that may result in agenda-setting and specifically framing, is inevitable. With a never-ending, near-limitless amount of information, filtering will occur by default. Subcultures within news organizations determine the type of published content, while editors and other news organization individuals filter messages to curate content for their target audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Fn2QAgAAQBAJ|title=Gatekeeping Theory|last=Shoemaker|first=Pamela J.|last2=Vos|first2=Timothy|date=2009-09-10|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781135860608}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rise of digital media, from blogs to social media, has significantly altered the media's gatekeeping role. In addition to more gates, there are also more gatekeepers. Google and Facebook both cater content to their users, filtering though thousands of search results and media postings to generate content aligned with a user's preferences.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gatekeeping in Transition|last=Vos and Heinderyckx|date=2015-04-28|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9780415731614|pages=12, 175, 10, 115, 175, 110}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, 63 percent of Facebook and Twitter users find news on their feeds, up from 57% from the previous year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.niemanlab.org/2015/07/new-pew-data-more-americans-are-getting-news-on-facebook-and-twitter/|title=New Pew data: More Americans are getting news on Facebook and Twitter|website=Nieman Lab|access-date=2016-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; With some many "gates" or outlets, news spreads without the aid of legacy media networks. In fact, users on social media can act as a check to the media, calling attention to bias or inaccurate facts.There is also a symbiotic relationship between social media users and the press: younger journalists use social media to track trending topics.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

[[Old media|Legacy media outlets]], along with newer [[Online newspaper|online-only outlets]], face enormous challenges. The multiplicity of outlets combined with downsizing in the aftermath of the [[Great Recession in the United States|2008 recession]] makes reportage more hectic than ever. One study found that journalists write about 4.5 articles per day. Public relations agencies play a growing role in news creation: "41 percent of press articles and 52 percent of broadcast news items contain PR materials which play an agenda-setting role or where PR material makes up the bulk of the story."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lewis|first=Justin|last2=Williams|first2=Andrew|last3=Franklin|first3=Bob|title=A COMPROMISED FOURTH ESTATE?|journal=Journalism Studies|volume=9|issue=1|pages=1–20|doi=10.1080/14616700701767974|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stories are often rushed to publication and edited afterwards, without "having passed through the full journalistic process." Still, audiences seek out quality content—whichever outlet can fulfill this need may acquire the limited attention span of the modern viewer.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

===== Spiral of silence =====
Individuals are disinclined to share or amplify certain messages because of a fear of [[social isolation]] and a willingness to self-censor. As applies to media effects studies, some individuals may silence their opinions if the media does not validate their importance or viewpoint. This [[spiral of silence]] can also apply to individuals in the media, who may refrain from publishing controversial media content.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Noelle-Neumann|first=Elisabeth|date=1974-06-01|title=The Spiral of Silence A Theory of Public Opinion|url=http://www.rcbsam.com/uploads/4/1/9/6/41960/n-neumann_spiral_of_silence.pdf|journal=Journal of Communication|volume=24|issue=2|pages=43–51|doi=10.1111/j.1460-2466.1974.tb00367.x|issn=1460-2466}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Features of current studies ==
After entering the 21st century, the rapid development of the Internet and [[Web 2.0|Web 2.0 technology]] is greatly reforming media use patterns. Media effects studies also are more diverse and specified. After conducting a [[meta-analysis]] on micro-level media effects theories, Valkenburg, Peter &amp; Walther (2016) identified five main features:&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Selectivity of media use ===
There are two propositions of this selectivity paradigm: (a) among the constellation of messages potentially attracting their attention, people only go to a limited portion of messages; (b) people are only influenced by those messages they select (Klapper 1960,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Effects of Mass Communication|last=Klapper JT|publisher=Free Press|year=1960|isbn=|location=Glencoe, IL|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rubin 2009&lt;ref name="Media"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Media effects: Advances In theory and research 3rd ed|last=Rubin, A. M.|publisher=Routledge|year=2009|isbn=|location=New York, NY|pages=165–184}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Researchers had noticed the selectivity of media use decades ago, and considered it as a key factor limiting media effects. Later, two theoretical perspectives, [[Uses and gratifications theory|uses-and-gratifications]] (Katz et al. 1973,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Katz E, Blumler JG, Gurevitch M |date=1973|title=Uses and gratifications research|url=|journal=Public Opinion Quarterly |volume=37 |issue= 4|pages=509–23|doi=10.1086/268109|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rubin 2009&lt;ref name="Media" /&gt;) and [[selective exposure theory]] (Knobloch-Westerwick 2015,&lt;ref name="Knobloch-Westerwick S. 2015"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Choice and Preference in Media Use|last=Knobloch-Westerwick S.|publisher=Routledge|year=2015|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zillmann &amp; Bryant 1985&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Selective Exposure to Communication|vauthors=Zillmann D, Bryant J |publisher=Erlbaum|year=1985|isbn=|location=Hillsdale, NJ|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;), had been developed based on this assumption, and aimed to pinpoint the psychological and social factors guiding and filtering audience's media selection. Generally, these theories put media user in the center of the media effect process, and conceptualize media use as a mediator between antecedents and consequences of media effects. In other words, users (with intention or not), develop their own media use effects.

=== Media properties as predictors ===
The inherent properties of media themselves are considered as predictors in media effects.
* Modality: Media formats have been evolving ever since the very beginning, whether the modality is text, auditory, visual or audiovisual is assumed to be affecting the selection and cognition of the users when they are engaging in media use. Known for his aphorism of "The medium is the message," Marshall McLuhan (1964) is one of the best-known scholars who believe it is the modality rather than the content of media that is affecting individuals and society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Understanding Media: The Extension of Man|last=McLuhan M.|publisher=Sphere Books|year=1964|isbn=|location=London|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Content properties: The majority of media effects studies still focus on the impact of content (e.g., violence, fearfulness, type of character, argument strength) on an audience. For example, Bandura's (2009) social cognitive theory postulates that media depictions of rewarded behavior and attractive media characters enhance the likelihood of media effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Media Effects: Advances in Theory and Research|last=Bandura A.|publisher=Routledge.|year=2009|isbn=|location=New York|pages=94–124}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Structural properties: Besides of modality and content, structural properties such as special effects, pace, visual surprises also play important roles in affecting audiences. By triggering the orienting reflex to media, these properties may initiate selective exposure (Knobloch-Westerwick 2015).&lt;ref name="Knobloch-Westerwick S. 2015"/&gt;

=== Media effects are indirect ===
After the all-power assumption of mass media was disproved by empirical evidence, the indirect path of the media's effect on audiences has been widely accepted. An indirect effect indicates that an independent variable (e.g., media use) affecting the dependent variables (e.g., outcomes of media use) via one or more intervening (mediating) variables. The conceptualization of indirect media effects urges us to pay attention to those intervening variables to better explain how and why media effects occur. Besides, examining indirect effects can lead to a less biased estimation of effects sizes in empirical research (Holbert &amp; Stephenson 2003).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Holbert RL, Stephenson MT |date=2003|title=The importance of indirect effects in media effects research: testing for mediation in structural equation modeling|url=|journal=J. Broadcast. Electron. Media |volume=47 |issue= 4|pages=556–72|doi=10.1207/s15506878jobem4704_5|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a model including mediating and moderating variables, it is the combination of direct and indirect effects that makes up the total effect of an independent variable on a dependent variable. Thus, "if an indirect effect does not receive proper attention, the relationship between two variables of concern may not be fully considered" (Raykov &amp; Marcoulides 2012)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A First Course in Structural Equation Modeling|author1=Raykov, T |author2=Marcoulides, G.A. |lastauthoramp=yes |publisher=Routledge|year=2012|isbn=|location=New York|pages=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Media effects are conditional ===
In correspondence with the statement that media effect is the result of a combination of variables, media effects can also be enhanced or reduced by individual difference and social context diversity. Many media effects theories hypothesize conditional media effects, including [[Uses and gratifications theory|uses-and-gratifications theory]] (Rubin 2009),&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; [[Spiral of silence|reinforcing spiral model]] (Slater 2007),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Slater, M. D.|date=2007|title=Reinforcing spirals: the mutual influence of media selectivity and media effects and their impact on individual behavior and social identity|url=|journal=Communication Theory |volume=17 |issue= 3|pages=281–303|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2885.2007.00296.x|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the conditional model of political communication effects (McLeod et al. 2009),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Media Effects: Advances in Theory and Research|author1=McLeod D.M |author2=Kosicki G.M |author3=McLeod J.M. |publisher=Routledge|year=2009|isbn=|location=New York|pages=228–251}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[elaboration likelihood model]] (Petty &amp; Cacioppo 1986).&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Advances in Experimental Social Psychology|author1=Petty R.E |author2=Cacioppo J.T |publisher=Academic|year=1986|isbn=|location=New York:|pages=123–205}}&lt;/ref&gt; Take the elaboration likelihood model as an example: the variable of "need for cognition", indicating users' tendency to enjoy effortful information processing, is considered as a moderator of media effects on attitudes.

=== Media effects are transactional ===
Many theories assume reciprocal causal relationships between different variables, including characteristics of media users, factors in environment, and outcomes of media (Bandura 2009).&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Transactional theories further support the selectivity paradigm (Feature 1), which assumes that audience somehow shapes their own media effects by selectively engaging in media use; transactional theories make an effort to explain how and why this occurs. Transactional media effects theories are the most complex among the five features. There are three basic assumptions. First, communication technologies (e.g., radio, television, internet) function as reciprocal mediators between information producers and receivers. They engage in transactions through these technologies (Bauer 1964).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bauer R.|date=1964|title=The obstinate audience: the influence process from the point of view of social communication|url=|journal=Am. Psychol. |volume=19 |issue= 5|pages=319–28|doi=10.1037/h0042851|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Second, the effect of media content are reciprocal between producers and receivers of media content. They influence each other. Producers can be influenced by receivers because they learn from what the audience needs and prefer (Webster 2009).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Media Choice: A Theoretical and Empirical Overview|last=Webster, J.G.|publisher=Routledge|year=2009|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Third, transactions can be distinguished as interpersonal.

However, these features are only limited within micro-level media effects studies, which are mostly focused on short-term, immediate, individual effects. We look forward to more syntheses on macro-level research.&lt;ref&gt;Section derived from {{cite journal | last1 = Valkenburg | first1 = P.

=== Political importance of mass media and how mass media influence political decisions ===
The images that media create and carry the weight of social responsibility and the right side of social value. Audiences learn and conduct their political sights of view from reading, listening to the political analysis and evaluation. The mass media are powerful guardians of proper political behavior because audience tends to trust the press who should inform them about government wrongdoing and providing proper suggestions. All of the mass media are politically important because of their potential to reach large groups of audiences. However, the influence of each media varies depending on their characteristics, ease of access and the quantity of the audience reached.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cary|first1=Mary Kate (2010)|title=5 Ways New Media Are Changing Politics|url=https://www.usnews.com/opinion/articles/2010/02/04/5-ways-new-media-are-changing-politics|website=U.S.News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Print media, including newspaper, article and news on internet webpage usually reach to those readers who are literate at appropriate levels and understand the factual political environment. Electronic media especially television broadcasts provide a greater sense of reality which sometimes provide more credibility than others and stronger influence to the audiences. Moreover, large segments of the U.S. population have limited reading skills, they usually find better understanding from conveying physical images, conversation and interviews between people from electronic media. They are especially well suited to attract viewers’ attention and arouse their emotions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=John|first1=Wihbey (2015)|title=How does social media use influence political participation and civic  engagement? A meta-analysis|url=http://journalistsresource.org/studies/politics/digital-democracy/social-media-influence-politics-participation-engagement-meta-analysis|website=Journalist's Resource}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since now it is the era of the Internet, the effect of Internet has extended every area. Politics is no exception, the relationship between organization and public opinion has been influenced by new media. New media includes online newspaper, blogs, social media and so on. More and more people prefer new media than traditional media because of the less limitation of new media, such as time limitation and space limitation. Most people have a cell phone or a computer. They can catch the news anytime in anyplace. As a result, new media has a greater impact on people. Politicians also notice new media is a more effective way to convey their message, and they use it to attract supporters. For example, both Barack Obama and The White House have Facebook page and Twitter. They can easily communicate with the public and gather them together by “share” and “like it”, which will benefit their political activities especially for presidential campaigns, because social media can help the candidate get their vote. One study concluded that social media is allowing politicians to be perceived as more authentic with a key finding that shows voters feel politicians to be more honest on social media, compared to interviews or TV shows. This is the case especially among young voters, who predominantly use these type of mediums, this opens up a new voter base for politicians to appeal to directly.&lt;ref&gt;Enli, G. and Rosenberg, L.T., 2018. Trust in the Age of Social Media: Populist Politicians Seem More Authentic. Social Media+ Society&lt;/ref&gt; Public opinion also affect politics through the new media. New media provides a two-way communication, which achieves an interactive role. People can directly send message to government and politicians can comment online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Media and Elections|first1=(2012)|title=The Electoral Knowledge Network|url=https://aceproject.org/ace-en/topics/me/mea/mea01c}}&lt;/ref&gt; If people are dissatisfied with the government, they can express their thought through social media and discuss with other people online. When those comments gather together, it will draw public opinion to focus on the wrongdoings of government. Since new media has a large user base, the political activity is followed by more people than before. New media lets people better supervise government behaviour. Also, governments can know public opinion through new media as reference for decision making. Although new media has both positive and negative effect on politics, it narrows the relationship between the public and politics. Public is not only an information receiver anymore. People also can give their advice and opinion to the government. Government also have a chance to get to know the thought of citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cole|first1=Juan (2016)|title=How the US Went Fascist: Mass Media Make Excuses for Trump Voters|url=http://billmoyers.com/story/how-the-us-went-fascist-mass-media-makes-excuses-for-trump-voters/|website=Moyers  &amp; Company}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The media play an indispensable role in the proper functioning of a democracy. Without mass media, openness and accountability are very tough to reach in contemporary democracies.  The media can inform the public of how effectively the current government or candidates have performed in the past and help them to account. Nevertheless, mass media can also hinder political transparency as well as help it. Politicians and political operatives can simulate the political virtues of transparency through rhetorical and [[media manipulation]]. There are three major societal functions that mass media perform to the political decisions raised by the political scientist Harold Lasswell: surveillance of the world to report ongoing events, interpretation of the meaning of events, and socialization of individuals into their cultural settings. The mass media regularly present politically crucial information on huge audiences and it also represents the reaction from the audience rapidly through the mass media. The government or the political decision-makers have the chance to have a better understanding of the real reaction from the public of those decisions they have made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kapko|first1=Matt (2016)|title=How social media is shaping the 2016 presidential election|url=http://www.cio.com/article/3125120/social-networking/how-social-media-is-shaping-the-2016-presidential-election.html|website=CIO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''International students''' are those students who chose to undertake all or part of their tertiary education in a country other than their own and move to that country for the specific purpose of studying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite wb|url=http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20090917182725104|title=What defines and international student|publisher=University World News|date=20 September 2009|access-date=16 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2016, there were nearly 5.1 million internationally mobile students (i.e. 2.3% of all tertiary students), up from 2.1 million in 2000.&lt;ref name=UIS&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://data.uis.unesco.org/index.aspx?queryid=169|title= Inbound internationally mobile students by continent of origin|author=[[UNESCO]] Institute for Statistics|access-date=2018-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States and United Kingdom attracted one-third of all international students in 2000, falling to 28% in 2016.&lt;ref name=UIS /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Choudaha|first=Rahul|date=March 2017|title=Three waves of international student mobility (1999-2020)|url=https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B4RmnCsexL7ZckFpR1FXVFFQZ2M/view|journal=Studies in Higher Education|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|volume=|pages=|doi=10.1080/03075079.2017.1293872|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==National definitions==

The definition of "foreign student" and "international student" varies in each country in accordance to their own national education system. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.iie.org/Research-and-Insights/Project-Atlas/Glossary :title=Glossary|publisher=Institute of International Education|access-date=16 November 2018|date=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the US International students are "Individuals studying in the United States on a non-immigrant, temporary visa that allows for academic study at the post- secondary level. Immigrants, permanent residents, citizens, resident aliens ("Green Card" holders), and refugees are excluded from this definition."

Canada defines international students as "....temporary residents who hve been approved by an immigration officer to study in Canada. The study permit identifies the level of study and the length of time the individual may study in Canada. International students do not need a study permit for courses of six months or less if they will finish the course within the period of stay authorized upon entry, which is usually six months. Every foreign student must have a student authorization, but may also have been issued other types of permits or authorizations."{{cn|date=November 2018}}

In Australia an international student is "A student on a student visa studying in Australia with an institution registered to deliver courses to such students. Students from New Zealand are not included in the student enrolment counts as they do not require a student visa." and in Japan the definition is "A student from a foreign economy who is receiving an education at any Japanese university, graduate school, junior college, college of technology, professional training college or university preparatory course and who resides in Japan with a 'college student' visa status."{{cn|date=November 2018}}

==Destinations of foreign students==
According to the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) in their 2009 World Conference on Higher Education report, Over 2.5 million students were studying outside their home country. UNESCO also predicted that the number of foreign students might rise to approximately 7 million by the year 2020.  The main destinations preferred were the United States, United Kingdom, Germany, France, Canada and Australia. Overall, the number of foreign students more than doubled to over 2 million between 2000 and 2007.&lt;ref name="Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) 2010"&gt;[http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/12/9/45612617.pdf Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) 2010].&lt;/ref&gt;

The greatest percentage increases of numbers of foreign students have occurred in New Zealand, Korea, the Netherlands, Greece, Spain, Italy and Ireland.&lt;ref name="Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) 2010"/&gt;

Traditionally the U.S and U.K have been the most prestigious choices, because of the presence of top 10 rankings Universities such as Harvard, Oxford, MIT and Cambridge. More recently however they have had to compete with the rapidly growing Asian higher education market. While US is the leading destination for foreign students, there is increasing competition from several destinations in East Asia such as China, Korea, Japan and Taiwan which are keen to attract foreign students for reputation and demographic reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dreducation.com/2017/03/Three-Waves-International-Student-Mobility-Choudaha.html|title=Three waves of international student mobility explain the past, present and future trends|website=www.dreducation.com|access-date=2017-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Student mobility in the first decade of the 21st century has been transformed by two major external events, the attack on the New York Trade Centre and the recession of 2008.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;The US to tightened visa requirements for students and Australia and the UK were successful in absorbing most of the growth in nu,mbers of foreign students. In 2009, international students represented 21.5% and 15.3% of higher education enrollment in Australia and the UK, compared to less than 4% in the US, according to the OECD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/edu/eag2011 |title=Education at a Glance |publisher=OECD |year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to OECD, almost one out of five foreign students is regionally mobile. This segment of regionally mobile students who seek [http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20130426103907495 global education at local cost is defined as "glocal" students].  Many "glocal" students consider pursuing transnational or cross-border education which allows them to earn a foreign credential while staying in their home countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dreducation.com/2016/05/Transnational-Education-Quality-Growth-Webinar-Recording.html|title=Webinar on Transnational Education: Recording of the Online Discussion with Global Experts ~ DrEducation: Global Higher Education Research and Consulting|last=Choudaha|first=Rahul|website=www.dreducation.com|access-date=2016-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the increase in tuition cost in leading destinations like the US and the UK along with the higher immigration barriers, many international students are exploring alternative destinations and demanding more "value for money."[http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20180724145334625]
It is projected that the number of internationally mobile students will reach 6.9 million by 2030, an increase of 51%, or 2.3 million students, from 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20180126131034717|title=Global universities unprepared for sea change ahead|last=|first=|date=26 January 2018|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of US visas issued to Chinese students to study at US universities has increased by 30 per cent, from more than 98,000 in 2009 to nearly 128,000 in October 2010, placing China as the top country of origin for foreign students, according to the "2010 Open Doors Report" published on the US Embassy in China website. 
The number of Chinese students increased. Overall, the total number of foreign students with a US Visa to study at colleges and universities increased by 3 per cent to a record high of nearly 691,000 in the 2009/2010 academic year.

China is openly pursuing a policy of growing its [[soft power]] globally, by way of persuasion and attraction. Attracting international students, especially by way of scholarships, is one effective way of growing this influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://monitor.icef.com/2016/01/education-and-the-exercise-of-soft-power-in-china/|author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt;|title=Education and the exercise of soft power in China|date=13 January 2016|website=ICEF Monitor|access-date=18 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://qz.com/1119447/china-is-training-africas-next-generation-of-leaders/|author=Lily Kuo|title=Beijing is cultivating the next generation of African elites by training them in China|date=14 December 2017|website=Quartz Africa|access-date=18 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Japan, Canada and New Zealand ===
Japan, Canada and New Zealand are perceived as evolving destinations for international students. In 2006, Japan, Canada and New Zealand together shared roughly 13% of the international student market, with approximately 327,000 of the 2.7 million students who traveled abroad for the purposes of higher education.&lt;ref name="World Education Services"&gt;[http://www.wes.org/educators/pdf/StudentMobility.pdf World Education Services] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101214053953/http://www.wes.org/educators/pdf/StudentMobility.pdf|date=2010-12-14}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Japan has around 180 000 overseas students studying at its institutions and the government has set targets to increase this to 300, 000 over the next few years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.studyjapan.go.jp/en/toj/toj09e.html|title=300000 Foreign Students Plan|publisher=|accessdate=27 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Canada has seen a large increase in the number of Indian students, where the number of Indian students rose 280% in 2010 compared to 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| publisher= Economic Times| title = France, Germany &amp; Canada: New overseas education destinations for Indians| url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2011-05-01/news/29491210_1_indian-students-uk-visa-rules|date = May 1, 2011| accessdate=June 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Organizations such as [[Learnhub]] are taking advantage of this growing trend of Indian international students by providing recruitment services that bring Indian students abroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| publisher=Learnhub| title=Learnhub.com| url=http://learnhub.com/home| date=June 20, 2011| accessdate=June 20, 2011}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, in Canada 10 percent of university students were international students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chao|first=E.

Recent changes to Canada's immigration regulations that came into effect on January 1, 2015 have placed international graduates from Canadian universities at a disadvantage. Under the new rules, foreign students who hold a degree or diploma from Canadian educational institutions will be treated on par with other groups of skilled workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.immigration.ca/international-students-seeking-canadian-residence-hit-hard-by-new-express-entry-system/|title=International Students Seeking Canadian Residence Hit Hard by New Express Entry System (Audio)|work=Canadian Citizenship &amp; Immigration Resource Center|accessdate=27 March 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150329070912/http://www.immigration.ca/international-students-seeking-canadian-residence-hit-hard-by-new-express-entry-system/|archivedate=29 March 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Malaysia, Singapore and India ===
Malaysia, Singapore and India are the emerging destinations for international students. These three countries have combined share of approximately 12% of the global student market with somewhere between 250,000 and 300,000 students having decided to pursue higher education studies in these countries in 2005–2006.&lt;ref name="World Education Services"/&gt;

The flow of international students above indicates the South-North phenomenon. In this sense, students from Asia prefer to pursue their study particularly in the United States.

==Requirements==
Prospective foreign students are usually required to sit for language tests, such as [[Cambridge English: First]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cambridgeenglish.org/exams/first/|title=Cambridge English: First (FCE)|publisher=|accessdate=15 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cambridge English: Advanced (CAE)|Cambridge English: Advanced]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cambridgeenglish.org/exams/advanced/|title=Cambridge English: Advanced (CAE)|publisher=|accessdate=15 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cambridge English: Proficiency]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cambridgeenglish.org/exams/proficiency/|title=Cambridge English: Proficiency (CPE)|publisher=|accessdate=15 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[IELTS]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ielts.org/ Ielts.org] (English-speaking education)&lt;/ref&gt; [[TOEFL]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ets.org ETS.org] (English-speaking education)&lt;/ref&gt; [[International Test of English Proficiency|iTEP]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130103181353/http://iteponline.com/en/ iteponline.com] (English-speaking education)&lt;/ref&gt; [[PTE Academic]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pearsonpte.com |title=English tests for study abroad, UK, Australia, USA from Pearson |publisher=Pearsonpte.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[DELF]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://french.about.com/ About.com] (French-speaking education)&lt;/ref&gt; or [[DELE]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.donquijote.org/english/courses.dele.asp DonQuijote.org] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080416075540/http://www.donquijote.org/english/courses.dele.asp |date=2008-04-16 }} (Spanish-speaking education)&lt;/ref&gt; before they are admitted. Tests notwithstanding, while some international students already possess an excellent command of the local language upon arrival, some find their language ability, considered excellent domestically, inadequate for the purpose of understanding lectures, and/or of conveying oneself fluently in rapid conversations. A research report commissioned by NAFSA: Association of International Educators investigated the scope of third-party providers offerings intensive English preparation programs with academic credit for international students in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dreducation.com/2017/05/pathway-research-international-student-recruitment.html|title=NAFSA research on landscape of third-party pathway partnerships in the US|website=www.dreducation.com|access-date=2017-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; These pathway programs are designed to recruit and support international students needing additional help with English and academic preparation before matriculating to a degree program.

===Student Visa===
Generally, foreign students as citizens of other countries are required to obtain a student visa, which ascertains their legal status for staying in the second country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Student Visa|url=https://travel.state.gov/content/visas/en/study-exchange/student.html|website=travel.state.gov|accessdate=16 June 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160603231159/https://travel.state.gov/content/visas/en/study-exchange/student.html|archive-date=3 June 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, before students come to the country, the students must select a school to attend to qualify for a student visa. The course of study and the type of school a foreign student plans to attend determine whether an [[F visa|F-1 visa]] or an [[M-1 visa]] is needed. Each student visa applicant must prove they have the financial ability to pay for their tuition, books and living expenses while they study in the states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Farrell|first1=Louis|title=How to Demonstrate Financial Ability as an International Student|url=https://www.usnews.com/education/blogs/international-student-counsel/2015/04/07/how-to-demonstrate-financial-ability-as-an-international-student|website=U.S.News &amp; World report|accessdate=16 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economic impact==
Research from the National Association of Foreign Student Advisers (NAFSA) shows the economic benefits of the increasing international higher-education enrollment in the United States. According to their 2013-2014 academic year analysis, international students have contributed $26.8 billion to the U.S economy and 340,000 jobs. This is almost a 12% increase in dollars added to the economy and an 8.5% increase associated with job support and creation compared to the previous year.
International students contribute more than job and monetary gains to the economy. NAFSA Executive Director and CEO Marlene M. Johnson has stated, "[international students] bring global perspectives into U.S. classrooms and research labs, and support U.S. innovation through science and engineering coursework."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How International Students Add Billions to the U.S. Economy|url=http://immigrationimpact.com/2014/11/19/international-students-add-billions-u-s-economy/|accessdate=June 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to NAFSA's research, their diverse views contribute to technological innovation has increased America's ability to compete in the global economy.

==Higher education marketing==
Marketing of higher education is a well-entrenched macro process today, especially in the major English-speaking nations i.e. Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the UK, and the USA. One of the major factors behind the worldwide evolution of educational marketing could be a result of globalization, which has dramatically shriveled the world. Due to intensifying competition for overseas students amongst MESDCs, i.e. major English-speaking destination countries, higher educational institutions recognize the significance of marketing themselves, in the international arena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestcorp.com/international-students.html|title=Wrest Corporation - International Internship &amp; MBA Consultant Delhi|publisher=|accessdate=27 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; To build sustainable international student recruitment strategies Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) need to diversify the markets from which they recruit, both to take advantage of future growth potential from emerging markets, and to reduce dependency on – and exposure to risk from – major markets such as China, India and Nigeria, where demand has proven to be volatile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.internationalstudentsurvey.com/2016/|title=International Student Survey|publisher=Hobsons|accessdate=26 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; For recruitment strategies, there are some approaches that higher education institutions adopt to ensure stable enrollments of international students, such as developing university preparation programs, like the [[Global Assessment Certificate]] (GAC) Program, and launching international branch campuses in foreign countries.

===Global Assessment Certificate (GAC) Program===
The Global Assessment Certification (GAC) Program is a university preparation program, developed and provided by [[ACT (test)|ACT]] Education Solution, Ltd., for the purpose of helping students to prepare for admission and enrolment overseas.&lt;ref name="Open Doors Report"/&gt; Moreover, the program helps students from non-English speaking backgrounds to prepare for university-level study, so they are able to successfully finish a bachelor's degree at university.
This program is primarily getting great attention from non-English-speaking countries like China and South Korea. Students who complete the GAC program have the opportunity to be admitted to 120 universities, so called [http://actinternationalservices.com/en/aesl/pathway.html Pathway Universities], located in popular destinations including the United States, the United Kingdom, and Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2016 GAC Pathway University Handbook|url=http://actinternationalservices.com/pdf/pathway.pdf|accessdate=16 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Mainly, the program consists of curriculums, such as Academic English, Mathematics, Computing, Study Skills, Business, Science and Social Science. Moreover, the program also provides the opportunity to get prepared for the ACT exam and English Proficiency tests like TOEFL and IELTS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is in the Global Assessment Certificate™ program?|url=http://actinternationalservices.com/en/gac/what.html|accessdate=16 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Foreign branch campuses===
[[International branch campus]] is a new strategy of recruiting foreign students in other countries in order to build strong global outreach by overcoming the limitations of physical distance. Indeed, opening branch campuses play a significant role of widening the landscape of the higher education. In the past, along with high demand for higher education, many universities in the United States established their branch campuses in foreign countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Clifford|first1=Megan|title=Assessing the Feasibility of Foreign Branch Campuses|url=https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/rgs_dissertations/RGSD300/RGSD354/RAND_RGSD354.pdf|website=rand.org|accessdate=16 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a report by the Observatory on Borderless Higher Education (OBHE), there was a 43% increase in the number of foreign branch campuses in the worldwide scale since 2006. American higher education institutions mostly take a dominant position in growth rate and the number of foreign branch campuses, accounting for almost 50 percent of current foreign branch campuses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Becker|first1=Rosa|title=International Branch Campuses: New Trends and Directions|url=https://ejournals.bc.edu/ojs/index.php/ihe/article/viewFile/8464/7598|website=ejournals.bc.edu|accessdate=16 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some research reports that recently said foreign branching campuses are facing several challenges and setbacks, for example interference of local government,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=María Eugenia Miranda|title=International Branch Campuses Producing Opportunities, Headaches|url=http://diverseeducation.com/article/64650/)|publisher=Diverse|accessdate=16 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
sustainability problems, and long-term prospects like damage on academic reputations and finance.

==The challenges for foreign students in English-speaking countries==
There is a trend for more and more students to go abroad to study in the U.S., Canada, U.K., and Australia to gain a broader education.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} English is the only common language spoken at universities in these countries, with the most significant exception being Francophone universities in Canada. International students not only need to acquire good communication skills and fluent English both in writing and speaking, but also absorb the Western academic writing culture in style, structure, reference, and the local policy toward academic integrity in academic writing.&lt;ref name="ireland"&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Ireland, Christopher and English, John|year=2011|title=Let Them Plagiarise: Developing Academic Writing in a Safe Environment|journal=Journal of Academic Writing|volume=1|issue=1|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/264452242_Let_Them_Plagiarise_Developing_Academic_Writing_in_a_Safe_Environment|pages=165–172|doi= 10.18552/joaw.v1i1.10}}&lt;/ref&gt; International students may have difficulty completing satisfactory assignments because of the difficulty with grammar and spelling, differences in culture, or a lack of confidence in English academic writing. Insightful opinions may lose the original meaning when transformed from the student's native language to English. Even if international students acquire good scores in English proficiency exams or are able to communicate with native British students frequently in class, they often find that the wording and formatting of academic papers in English-speaking universities are different from what they are used to due to certain cultural abstraction. Students who experience this discrepancy get lower scores of adaptability to new environment and higher scores about anxiety. Instead of the mood, students who were further away from home would be more willing to go back home and regress from their aims in life, this hardship can lead to depression. Partly this is due to the academic contagions of the foreign university like not integrating [[contrastive rhetoric]] aspect, low-support for adaptation like providing opportunities to better their English in a non-competitive and meaningful way. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://help.cucas.edu.cn/index/detail?id=2842 |title=Top Chinese Universities in Medicine |publisher=CUCAS |date=2010-05-28 |accessdate=2014-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most foreign students encounter difficulties in language use. Such issues make it difficult for the student to make domestic friends and gain familiarity with the local culture. Sometimes, these language barriers can subject international students to ignorance or disrespect from native speakers.&lt;ref&gt;Stephanie Lindemann, "Listening with an attitude: A model of native speaker comprehension of non-native speakers in the United States" Language in Society 31. (2002).&lt;/ref&gt; Most international students are also lacking a support groups in the country they are studying. Although all the colleges in North America, that are in a student exchange programs, do have International Student Office, it sometimes does not have resources and capability to consider their students' individual needs when it comes to adapting the new environment. The more a particular college has students coming from the same country the better the support is for getting involved to the new culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Beck|first1=Richard|last2=Taylor|first2=Cathy|last3=Robbins|first3=Marla|title=Missing home: Sociotropy and autonomy and their relationship to psychological distress and homesickness in college freshmen|journal=Anxiety, Stress &amp; Coping|date=June 2003|volume=16|issue=2|pages=155–166|doi=10.1080/10615806.2003.10382970}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Foreign students have several challenges in their academic studies at North American universities. Studies have shown that these challenges include several different factors: inadequate English proficiency; unfamiliarity with North American culture; lack of appropriate study skills or strategies; academic learning anxiety; low social self-efficacy; financial difficulties; and separation from family and friends.&lt;ref&gt;Jinyan Huang&amp; Kathleen Brown "cultural factors affecting Chinese ESL students’ academic learning" Education. (2009).&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the general perception that American culture is characterized more by diversity than by homogeneity, the American ideology of cultural homogeneity implies an American mindset that because Eurocentric cultures are superior to others, people with different cultures should conform to the dominant monocultural canon and norms.&lt;ref&gt;Hsieh, Min-Hua. "Challenges For International Students In Higher Education: One Student's Narrated Story Of Invisibility And Struggle." College Student Journal 41.2 (2007): 379-391.Academic Search Premier. Web. 16 Nov. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

U.S. colleges and universities have long welcomed students from China, where their higher-education system cannot meet the demand. Three years ago, a record 10 million students throughout China took the national college entrance test, competing for 5.7 million university slots. Because foreign undergraduates typically fail to qualify for U.S. federal aid, colleges here can provide limited financial help. Now, thanks to China's booming economy in recent years, more Chinese families can afford to pay.
U.S. colleges also face challenges abroad. Worries about fraud on test scores and transcripts make occasional headlines. And even Chinese students who test high on an English-language proficiency test may not be able to speak or write well enough to stay up to speed in a U.S. classroom, where essay writing and discussions are common.&lt;ref name="Number of Chinese students applying for a US Visa increases"&gt;[http://www.visabureau.com/america/news/16-11-2010/number-of-chinese-students-applying-for-a-us-visa-increases.aspx "Number of Chinese students applying for a US Visa increases"], ''USA Visa Bureau,'' November 16, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Chinese international students face other challenges besides language proficiency. The Chinese educational structure focuses on exam-oriented education, with educational thinking and activities aimed towards meeting the [[entrance examination]]. Students stress more on exam performance, and teachers are inclined to focus on lecturing to teach students what may be on the test. In addition, "parents are also convinced that the more students listened to the lectures, the better they would score on the finals."&lt;ref name="A First-Person Explanation of Why Some International Students Are Silent in the U.S. Classroom"&gt;Bista,Krishna, [http://www.facultyfocus.com/articles/learning-styles/a-first-person-explanation-of-why-some-international-students-are-silent-in-the-u-s-classroom/ "A First-Person Explanation of Why Some International Students Are Silent in the U.S. Classroom"], "Faculty Focus", June 23, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;  With more than 304,040 Chinese students enrolled in the US in 2014/15, China is by far the leading source of international students at American universities and colleges, however, there are [https://resources.interedge.org/2016/04/20/three-waves/ three waves of growth in Chinese students in the US]. Each of the three waves differs in terms of needs and expectations and corresponding support services needed.

International students also face cross-cultural barriers that hinder their ability to succeed in a new environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://resources.interedge.org/category/intercultural-competence/|title=Intercultural Competence – International Student Success Training and Resources|website=resources.interedge.org|access-date=2016-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, there are differences in terms of receiving and giving feedback which influences the academic engagement and even job and internship search approach of international students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://resources.interedge.org/2016/04/10/cross-cultural-map-feedback/|title=Navigate the Cross-cultural Map: Feedback|last=Hu|first=Di|date=2016-04-10|website=International Student Success Training and Resources|access-date=2016-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Plagiarism is the most serious offense in academia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Problems with Plagiarism|url=http://www.mcny.edu/student_serv/lecblog/the-problems-with-plagiarism|accessdate=June 16, 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160920175418/http://www.mcny.edu/student_serv/lecblog/the-problems-with-plagiarism|archivedate=September 20, 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plagiarism has two subtle forms, one of which includes the omission of elements required for proper citations and references.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How to Recognize Plagiarism: Tutorials and Tests|url=https://www.indiana.edu/~academy/firstPrinciples/certificationTests/index.html|accessdate=June 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second form is unacknowledged use or incorporation of another person's work or achievement.  Violation of either form can result in a student's expulsion. For the international students the word plagiarism is a foreign word.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=For some international students, 'plagiarism' is a foreign word.|url=http://www.mprnews.org/story/2014/10/08/international-students-cheating|accessdate=June 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of them are unfamiliar with American academic standards and colleges aren’t good about giving a clear definition of the word's meaning. For example, many international students don’t know using even one sentence of someone else's work can be considered plagiarism. Most colleges give students an E on their plagiarized assignments and future offenses often result in failing class or being kicked out of university.

International students studying in a foreign country face a life altering event which can cause distress that can potentially affect their mental wellness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=|title=Enhancing Social Support, Hardiness, and Acculturation to Improve Mental Health among Asian Indian International Students|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.2190/IQ.30.1.e|journal=International Quarterly of Community Health Education|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many students report homesickness and loneliness in their initial transition, experience isolation from peers and struggle with understanding cultural differences while staying abroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kanekar|first=Amar|last2=Sharma|first2=Manoj|last3=Atri|first3=Ashutosh|title=Enhancing Social Support, Hardiness, and Acculturation to Improve Mental Health among Asian Indian International Students|url=https://doi.org/10.2190/IQ.30.1.e|journal=International Quarterly of Community Health Education|volume=30|issue=1|pages=55–68|doi=10.2190/iq.30.1.e}}&lt;/ref&gt; In certain cultures, mental illness is seen as a sign of weakness. Because of this, international students believe they can prevail through their struggles alone without help, which can lead to,  a decrease in mental wellness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=|title=Enhancing Social Support, Hardiness, and Acculturation to Improve Mental Health among Asian Indian International Students|url=https://doi.org/10.2190/IQ.30.1.e|journal=International Quarterly of Community Health Education|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Common symptoms among international students from China in particular noted that two prevailing symptoms were discovered: 45 percent of the students faced depression and 29 percent of the students faced anxiety.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://worldwidescience.org/topicpages/h/higher+internalizing+symptoms.html|title=higher internalizing symptoms: Topics by WorldWideScience.org|website=worldwidescience.org|language=en|access-date=2018-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stressors that lead international students to struggle with anxiety are rooted in numerous causes, including academic pressures, financial issues, adapting to a new culture, creating friendships, and feelings of loneliness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://campusmentalhealth.ca/literature/international-student-mental-health/|title=International Student Mental Health - Centre for Innovation in Campus Mental Health|last=Health|first=Centre for Innovation in Campus Mental|work=Centre for Innovation in Campus Mental Health|access-date=2018-03-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; International students are also more likely to rely on peers for support through their transition than teachers or adult peers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hyun|first=Jenny|last2=Quinn|first2=Brian|last3=Madon|first3=Temina|last4=Lustig|first4=Steve|date=September 2007|title=Mental health need, awareness, and use of counseling services among international graduate students|journal=Journal of American college health: J of ACH|volume=56|issue=2|pages=109–118|doi=10.3200/JACH.56.2.109-118|issn=0744-8481|pmid=17967756}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the student is unable to make friends in their new environment, they will struggle more with their transition than an international student who has established relationships with their peers.&lt;ref name="psycnet.apa.org"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=|title=Moderating effects of perceived language discrimination on mental health outcomes among Chinese international students.|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2015-14250-001|journal=Asian American Journal of Psychology|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

International students also face language discrimination, which may exacerbate mental health symptoms.&lt;ref name="psycnet.apa.org"/&gt; Evidence has not conclusively shown that language discrimination is a greater risk factor than discrimination against foreigners.&lt;ref name="psycnet.apa.org"/&gt; However, there has not been any conclusive evidence to show whether language discrimination plays a significantly larger role than simple foreigner discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wei|first=Meifen|last2=Liang|first2=Ya-Shu|last3=Du|first3=Yi|last4=Botello|first4=Raquel|last5=Li|first5=Chun-I|title=Moderating effects of perceived language discrimination on mental health outcomes among Chinese international students.|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1037/aap0000021|journal=Asian American Journal of Psychology|volume=6|issue=3|pages=213–222|doi=10.1037/aap0000021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Study abroad==
Studying abroad is the act of a student pursuing educational opportunities in a country other than one's own.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|publisher=BBC News| title = Students Should Study Abroad|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/education/720344.stm| date = 20 April 2000| accessdate=2010-06-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This can include primary, secondary and post-secondary students. A 2012 study showed number of students studying abroad represents about 9.4% of all students enrolled at institutions of higher education in the United States&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| publisher=NAFSA: Association of International Educators| title=Trends in U.S. Study Abroad| url=http://www.nafsa.org/public_policy.sec/study_abroad_2/demographics_of_study/| accessdate=18 December 2010| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101219190829/http://www.nafsa.org/public_policy.sec/study_abroad_2/demographics_of_study/| archive-date=19 December 2010| dead-url=yes| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;National Center for Education Statistics.

Studying abroad is a valuable program for international students as it is intended to increase the students' knowledge and understanding of other cultures. International education not only helps students with their language and communicating skills, but also encourages students to develop a different perspective and cross cultural understanding of their studies which will further their education and benefit them in their career.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sowa|first=Patience A.|date=2002-03-01|title=How valuable are student exchange programs?|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/he.49/abstract|journal=New Directions for Higher Education|language=en|volume=2002|issue=117|pages=63–70|doi=10.1002/he.49|issn=1536-0741}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://search.proquest.com/openview/f4e4f0bb001fc0eee5905fb2ea84a055/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&amp;cbl=26636|title=Translating Study Abroad Experiences for Workplace Competencies - ProQuest|website=search.proquest.com|language=en|access-date=2018-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Main factors that determine the outcome quality of international studies are transaction dynamics (between the environmental conditions and the international student), quality of environment, and the student's [[Coping (psychology)|coping]] behavior.

=== Distinctions in Classroom culture ===
Certain distinctions and differences can become sources of cultural shock and cultural misunderstandings that can lead a student to inhibit adaptation and adjustment. For example, a key requirement in many foreign institutions is participation. Failure to participate in the classroom with faculty can be a serious obstacle to academic success and if it is coupled with the view that professors are to be held in awe, then the problem can be reflected in the grades given for class participation. Lack of participation can be interpreted by faculty as failure to learn the course content or disinterest in the topic.

Some of the identified distinctions are:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| publisher=NAFSA: Association of International Educators| title=Classroom Culture's in Abroad| url=http://www.nafsa.org/| accessdate=17 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Semester system has three models, they are (1) the semester system comprising two terms, one in fall and one in winter/spring (summer term is not required); (2) the trimester system comprising three terms that includes summer (one of these terms can be a term of vacation); and (3) the quarter system comprising the four terms of fall, winter, spring, and summer, and in which the student can choose one of them to take as a vacation.
* The schedule of the classes is a standard five-day week for classes, but the instruction hours in a week may be divided into a variety of models. Two common models of choice are Monday/Wednesday/Friday (MWF) and Tuesday/Thursday (TT) model. As a result, the class hours per week are the same, but the length of time per class for the MWF will be different from the TT.
* Most foreign institutes values ideologies of fairness and independence. This standards ensure the rights and responsibilities of all students, regardless of background. Most institutions that define the rights and responsibilities of their students also provide a code of conduct to guide their behavior. Because independence and freedom comes with responsibilities.
* Certain immigration regulations allow international students to gain practical experience during their studies through employment in their field of study like an internship during your study, and at other times for one year of employment after you complete your studies. The eligibility factors are often disseminated through international students office at the college or university.
* Faculty differ both in rank and by the duration of their contracts. They are (1) Distinguished teaching and research faculty hold the most honored rank among faculty. They typically have the doctoral degree and are usually tenured (i.e. on a permanent contract with the school until they retire) and record of their personal excellence accounts for their standing; (2) Emeritus professors are honored faculty who have retired from the university but continue to teach or undertake research at colleges and universities; (3) Full professors are also tenured and hold the doctoral degree. It is length of service and the support of departmental chairpersons, colleagues, and administrators that leads to the promotion to this rank; (4) Associate professors typically hold the doctoral degree and are the most recent to receive tenure; (5) Assistant professors may or may not yet have their doctoral degrees and have held their teaching or research posts for less than seven years; (6) Instructors are usually the newest faculty. They may or may not hold the doctoral degree and are working towards tenure; (7) Adjunct professors and visiting professors may hold professorial rank at another institution. They are not tenured (usually retained on a year by year contract) and they are often honored members of the university community.
* Most institutes that accept international students have faculty who are leaders that can integrate best elements of teacher centered and [[Student-centred learning|learner centered]] pedagogical styles that integrates and leads students of every diversity to a path of success. They are careful not to obstruct a student with their own personality or achievements and maintain a resourceful, open and supportive "holding environment". Simplified, meaningful resource dissemination and engaging students in participatory and active learning is the key to this mixed learning. Lack of skill in handling such pedagogical methods might result in straining the students (taking classes in a faster pace disregarding the quality and quantity of the information transferred, which translates as lack of internal agency to make students learning meaningful by being an educational agent - lack of teacher agency&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Mark Priestley|author2=Gert Biesta|author3=Sarah Robinson|title=Teacher Agency: An Ecological Approach|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=09hbCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA28|date=22 October 2015|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=978-1-4725-2587-1|pages=28+}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and at other instances downgrade into a liberal [[laissez-faire]] style which might affect negatively on students performance. The skill of the tutor is exemplified in many forms one such is when they are able to keep some students from dominating (attention seeking, disruptive or disrespectful) and to draw in those who are reticent in a participatory section.
* Students are expected to know the content of their courses from the class website (structure of the course, frame of references, jargon's) and to think independently about it and to express their own perspectives and opinions in class and in their written work. Open disagreement is a sign of violent intentions in certain cultures and in other cultures it is merely expressing one’s opinion, this aspect can be challenging if proper [[people skills]] is absent in the group and [[group development]] isn't given importance. Similar is the case with asking questions, in certain classroom cultures it is tolerated asking vague questions and this is interpreted as a sign of interest from the student whereas in other cultures asking vague questions is a display of ignorance in public that results in loss of face and embarrassment, even if this behavior is counterproductive for a learning environment, it is largely dependent upon the transaction dynamics in classroom cultures. There are also certain institutes and cultures that disallow student discussion at certain topics and keep limitations to what can be discussed and punitive means for deterring from topics that shouldn't be discussed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/what-genocide-california-university-grapples-clash-between-native-american-student-2085889|title=What Is Genocide? California University Grapples With Clash Between Native-American Student, History Professor Over This Question|date=7 September 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; But often direct communication is considered vital for academic survival.
* Foreign university programs differ from structured programs of universities in certain countries. In each quarter the student is given choice to select the courses they deem important to them for gaining credits. There is no proportion for no. of courses that a student can take in each term, however program fees paid at a single time can lead to fees deduction in each quarter. In general, students are not recommended to take many courses at a time as they require to gain certain no. of credits to pass a quarter which is dependent upon the grades that they obtain from the courses, and this credits have little to do with the actual credit hours spent for each courses. For the courses students have to pre-register as they are not automatically assigned. Though its an open structure for course selections, students might require to take certain compulsory courses for the program as maintained by departments for degree standardization.
* Foreign institutions differ in their requirement of the content that a student require to be familiarized with and this difference is identifiable in programs which have similar objectives and structure that of different universities. Some may be professional oriented and thus give importance to depth in certain areas and some might be for providing a breadth of knowledge on the subject. Commonly, some institutes might require to master the essentials of a subject as a whole while others might require to master large quantities of content on the subject which might not seem practical in a framework of short period of time (An example is [[Outliers (book)|10,000-Hour Rule]]).&lt;ref&gt;Esterman, M., Noonan, S. K., Rosenberg, M., &amp; DeGutis, J. (2012). In the zone or zoning out? Tracking behavioral and neural fluctuations during sustained attention. Cerebral Cortex, 23(11), 2712-2723.&lt;/ref&gt; More accessible institutions provide syllabus of their previous and current programs and courses for better pre- and post- program communication.
* Classroom etiquette may differ from institute to institute. In western institutes the old standard of practice for students to address faculty is by their last name and the title "Professor", but it is not uncommon for faculty to be on a first-name basis with students today. However it is a good etiquette to check with the faculty member before addressing him or her by their first name only. Both students and faculty often dress very informally, and it is not unusual for faculty to roam the classroom while talking or to sit on the edge of a table in a very relaxed posture. Relaxed dress and posture are not, however, signs of relaxed standards of performance. Sometimes faculty, administrators, and even staff may sometimes hold receptions or dinners for their students. In that case, students should ask what the dress should be for the occasion; sometimes students will be expected to wear professional dress (suit coat and tie for men, and a suit or more formal dresses for women). Faculty wouldn't be caring even if they elicit the need of participation in classroom or as personally involved with students even if they engage students in frameworks/styles the student might understand the topic. This is because the faculty-student relationship is considered to be professional. Relationships in the West are most often determined by some kind of function. Here the function is guidance, education and skill development.
* In occidental institutions students are evaluated in many ways, including exams, papers, lab reports, simulation results, oral presentations, attendance and participation in classroom discussion. The instructors use a variety of types of exams, including multiple choice, short answer, and essay. Most adept instructor's provide guides or models of assignment construction, framing and on asking questions and how to prepare for their exams. Most students are expected to be creative in presentation (to avoid similarity in paper submissions), systematic in formatting (citation: [[Style guide]]) and invested for drawing and providing positive individualism to the group/class (group purpose, role identity for autonomy, positive thinking, value oriented responsible self-expression, etc. vs. attendant selfishness, alienation, divisiveness, etc.) aligned with the common development objective.
* Relationships are an important part of the foreign academic experience and for healthy social support. Relationships with faculty (instructors and academic advisor's) are very important for academic success and for bridging cultural gap. But in off campus venues, appreciate their life outside of campus and every time you view one another as individuals, avoid asking favors that can affect teacher student comfort zones and expect cautiousness from them in an attempt to avoid notions of favoritism and friendliness to break down barriers of role and culture.

A key factor in international academic success is learning approaches that can be taken on a matter from one another and simultaneously assimilating inter-cultural experiences.

=== Titles and roles in Administrative structure ===
* The vice-chancellor or vice-president for academic affairs manages the various schools and departments.
* The council of deans oversees the separate schools, institutes, and programs offered by the university or college.
* The departmental chairperson manages the affairs of the separate departments in each school or college.
* Faculty is responsible for teaching and research in and beyond the classroom.
* Secretaries and technical support staff in foreign countries have much authority than their counterparts in certain countries. They are treated respectfully by faculty and students alike.

=== Accommodation ===

Accommodation is a major factor that determines study abroad experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Dr. T.P. Sethumadhavan|title=Study Abroad|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TeyvDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA129|year=2014|publisher=DC Books|isbn=978-81-264-4803-6|pages=129–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Anna Lidstone|author2=Caroline Rueckert|title=The Study Abroad Handbook|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D_EcBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA145|year=2007|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=978-1-137-02056-7|pages=145–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Host family ====
A host family volunteers to house a student during their program. The family receives payment for hosting. Students are responsible for their own spending, including school fees, uniform, text books, internet, and phone calls. Host families could be family units with or without children or retired couples; most programs require one host to be at least 25 years of age. The host families are well prepared to experience a new culture and give a new cultural experience to the student. A student could live with more than one family during their international study program to expand their knowledge and experience more of the new culture. Host families are responsible for providing a room, meals, and a stable family environment for the student. Most international student advisory's allow for a switch of hosts if problems arise.

==== Housing ====
An international student involved in study abroad program can choose to live  [[on-campus housing|on campus]] or off campus. Living off campus is a popular choice, because students are more independent and learn more about the new culture when they are on their own. Universities that host international students will offer assistance in obtaining accommodation. Universities in Asia have on-campus housing for international students on exchange or studying full-time. Temporary options include hostels, hotels, or renting. [[Homestay]]s, paid accommodation with a host family, are available in some countries.

=== Coping in Study abroad ===

==== The w-curve adjustment model ====

The w-curve model created by Gullahorn and Gullahorn (1963) is W shaped model that attempts to give a visual description of a travelers possible experience of culture shock when entering a new culture and the re-entry shock experienced when returning home. The model has seven stages.

#Honeymoon Stage
#Hostility Stage
#Humorous/Rebounding Stage
#In-Sync Stage
#Ambivalence Stage
#Re-Entry Culture Shock Stage
#Re-Socialization Stage

Each stage of the model aims to prepare travellers for the rollercoaster of emotions that they may experience both while returning and traveling from a trip abroad. The hope in the creation of this model is to help prepare travelers for the negative feelings often associated with living in another culture. By doing so, it is the goal that these emotions will be better dealt with.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/|title=Homepage - Wiley|website=www.wiley.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Positive affectivity ====

Affectivity is an emotional disposition, people who are high on positive affectivity experience positive emotions and moods like joy and excitement, and view the world, including themselves and other people, in a positive light. They tend to be cheerful, enthusiastic, lively, sociable, and energetic. Research has found that student's studying  abroad with a positive emotional tendency have higher satisfaction and interaction with the environment, they engage in the staying country's citizenship behaviours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Velliaris, Donna M.|author2=Coleman-George, Deb|title=Handbook of Research on Study Abroad Programs and Outbound Mobility|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CoPvDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA724|date=24 August 2016|publisher=IGI Global|isbn=978-1-5225-0170-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, J.

[[File:Yantra-shatkona.jpg|thumb|right|The Kagome crest]]

The '''Kagome crest''' or '''Kagome''' '''[[Mon (emblem)|mon]]''' (籠目 ''kagome'', “basket eye” + 紋 ''mon'', “crest, pattern”), is a star shaped ([[hexagram]]) crest related to the [[kagome lattice]] design. It can be found in many of the oldest [[Shinto]] shrines dating back to at least the 5th century BCE, and is present on almost all the stone lanterns approaching the [[Ise-jingu]]. The Kagome crest is also sometimes depicted as an eight pointed star ([[octagram]]) composed of two interlocking squares, similar to the [[Star of Lakshmi]].

In regards to [[heraldry]], the Kagome crest is often associated with the [[Hata clan]].

To a Western audience the Kagome crest as religious symbol perhaps most closely resembles the [[Star of David]], however any direct [[Japanese-Jewish common ancestry theory|connection between the two]] is unlikely. If a cultural connection involving the Kagome crest does exist, it is most likely related to the ''[[Shatkona|satkona]]'' of [[Hinduism]].

The '''M50 Roma Emcampment in Ireland''' was a group of about 100 [[Romani people]] from [[Romania]] camped in a roundabout on the [[M50 motorway (Ireland)|M50 motorway]] in the [[Ballymun]] area of [[Dublin]]'s north side, through the summer of 2007.  Some Romani also camped in a nearby derelict house.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2007/0724/roma.html|title=63 Roma leave M50 camp to await flight|date=24 July 2007|website=Rte.ie|accessdate=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2007, they were deported from Ireland, by order of immigration minister [[Conor Lenihan]].

==Controversy==
The Roma claimed conditions at the camp were better than at home. The Romanian Ambassador went on the record in response, decrying those selling their homes in Romanian, to come to Ireland, despite the fact that Ireland did not allow free labour access or social welfare access to Romanian and Bulgarian nationals of Roma background.

The ambassador went to claim at least three were guilty of murder and 26 others had criminal convitions.

A claim they could not get work at home, was met with a declaration from the manager of the local shoe factory that he would give work to all that returned, as he cannot get or keep workers.

Conditions in his factory were not investigated, as this is rare in a nation with such high unemployment among all sections of society.

==Pavee Point==
The [[Irish Traveller]] pressure group [[Pavee Point]] has been advising the Roma, and are under pressure for urging some members to fight the deportation.

==Reaction==
The mayor of the town from where they are from has condemned them, and brought some of the press to show them the town and the [[Roma Special School]] that is newly constructed.

==Irish press reaction==
The Irish ''[[Star on Sunday]]'' however went to the bother of interviewing Roma in the village where these were from, and some confirmed the mayor's and ambassador's claims.

[[File:2002-10-26 11-15 (Andalusien &amp; Lissabon 263) Lissabon, Belém, Torre de Belém.jpg|thumb|300px|The [[Tower of Belém]], in Lisbon, is one of the most representative examples of Manueline style.]]
[[File:View from the Cloisters in the Jerónimos Monastery.JPG|thumb|300px|Manueline ornamentation in the cloisters of [[Jerónimos Monastery]], Belem, Portugal]]

The '''Manueline''' ({{lang-pt|estilo manuelino}}, {{IPA-pt|ɨʃˈtilu mɐnweˈɫinu|IPA}}), or '''Portuguese late Gothic''', is the sumptuous, composite [[Portugal|Portuguese]] style of architectural ornamentation of the first decades of the 16th century, incorporating maritime elements and representations of the discoveries brought from the voyages of [[Vasco da Gama]] and [[Pedro Álvares Cabral]]. This innovative style synthesizes aspects of Late [[Gothic architecture]] with influences of the [[Spain|Spanish]] [[Plateresque]] style, [[Mudéjar]],  [[Italy|Italian]] urban architecture, and [[Flanders|Flemish]] elements. It marks the transition from [[Gothic architecture|Late Gothic]] to Renaissance. The construction of churches and monasteries in Manueline was largely financed by proceeds of the lucrative [[spice trade]] with Africa and India.

The style was given its name, many years later, by [[Francisco Adolfo de Varnhagen]], Viscount of Porto Seguro, in his 1842 book, ''Noticia historica e descriptiva do Mosteiro de Belem, com um glossario de varios termos respectivos principalmente a architectura gothica'', in his description of the [[Jerónimos Monastery]]. Varnhagen named the style after [[Manuel I of Portugal|King Manuel I]], whose reign (1495–1521) coincided with its development. The style was much influenced by the astonishing successes of the [[Portugal in the Age of Discovery|voyages of discovery]] of Portuguese navigators, from the coastal areas of Africa to the discovery of Brazil and the ocean routes to the Far East, drawing heavily on the style and decorations of East Indian temples.

Although the period of this style did not last long (from 1490 to 1520), it played an important part in the development of Portuguese art. The influence of the style outlived the king. Celebrating the newly maritime power, it manifested itself in architecture (churches, monasteries, palaces, castles) and extended into other arts such as sculpture, painting, works of art made of precious metals, [[faience]] and furniture.

==Characteristics==
[[File:Convento Cristo December 2008-11.jpg|thumb|upright|The window of the Convent of Christ in Tomar is a well-known example of Manueline style]]
[[Image:Mosteiro dos Jeronimos - Igreja 2.jpg|thumb|upright|Manueline interior of the [[Jerónimos Monastery]] in [[Lisbon]]]]

This decorative style is characterized by virtuoso complex ornamentation in portals, windows, columns and arcades. In its end period it tended to become excessively exuberant as in Tomar.

Several elements appear regularly in these intricately carved stoneworks:
* elements used on ships: the [[armillary]] sphere (a navigational instrument and the personal emblem of Manuel I and also symbol of the [[cosmos]]), spheres, anchors, anchor chains, ropes and cables.
* elements from the sea, such as shells, pearls and strings of seaweed.
* botanical motifs such as laurel branches, oak leaves, acorns, poppy capsules, corncobs, thistles.
* symbols of Christianity such as the cross of the [[Order of Christ (Portugal)|Order of Christ]] (former Templar knights), the military order that played a prominent role and helped finance the first voyages of discovery. The cross of this order decorated the sails of the Portuguese ships.
* elements from newly discovered lands (such as the tracery in the ''Claustro Real'' in the [[Monastery of Batalha]], suggesting Islamic [[filigree]] work, influenced by buildings in India)
* columns carved like twisted strands of rope
* semicircular arches (instead of Gothic pointed arches) of doors and windows, sometimes consisting of three or more convex curves
* multiple pillars
* eight-sided capitals
* lack of symmetry
* conical [[pinnacle]]s
* bevelled crenellations
* ornate portals with niches or [[canopy (building)|canopies]].

==Examples==
When King Manuel I died in 1521, he had funded 62 construction projects. However, much original Manueline architecture in Portugal was lost or damaged beyond restoration in the [[1755 Lisbon earthquake]] and subsequent [[tsunami]]. In [[Lisbon]], the [[Ribeira Palace]], residence of King Manuel I, and the [[Hospital Real de Todos os Santos]] (''All-Saints Hospital'') were destroyed, along with several churches. The city, however, still has outstanding examples of the style in the [[Jerónimos Monastery]] (mainly designed by [[Diogo Boitac]] and [[Juan de Castillo|João de Castilho]]) and in the small fortress of the [[Belém Tower]] (designed by [[Francisco de Arruda]]). Both are located close to each other in the [[Belém, Lisbon|Belém neighbourhood]]. The portal of the [[Church of Nossa Senhora da Conceição Velha]], in [[Baixa Pombalina|downtown Lisbon]], has also survived destruction.

[[File:Jerónimos April 2009-4.jpg|thumb|Manueline exterior of the [[Jerónimos Monastery]] in [[Lisbon]].]]
Outside Lisbon, the church and chapter house of the [[Convent of the Order of Christ]] at [[Tomar]] (designed by [[Diogo de Arruda]]) is a major Manueline monument. In particular, the large window of the chapter house, with its fantastic sculptured organic and twisted rope forms, is one of the most extraordinary achievements of the Manueline style.

Other major Manueline monuments include the arcade screens of the Royal Cloister (designed by [[Diogo Boitac]]) and the Unfinished Chapels (designed by [[Mateus Fernandes]]) at the [[Monastery of Batalha]] and the [[Palace of Sintra|Royal Palace of Sintra]].

Other remarkable Manueline buildings include the church of the [[Monastery of Jesus of Setúbal]] (one of the earliest Manueline churches, also designed by Diogo Boitac), the [[Santa Cruz Monastery]] in [[Coimbra]], the main churches in [[Golegã]], [[Vila do Conde]], [[Moura Municipality|Moura]], [[Caminha]], [[Olivenza|Olivença]] and portions of the cathedrals of [[Braga Cathedral|Braga]] (main chapel), [[Viseu]] (rib vaulting of the nave) and [[Catedral da Guarda|Guarda]] (main portal, pillars, vaulting). Civil buildings in Manueline style exist in [[Évora]] (home to the  Évora Royal Palace of 1525, by Pedro de Trillo, Diogo de Arruda and Francisco de Arruda) and the [[Castle of Évoramonte]] of 1531), [[Viana do Castelo, Portugal|Viana do Castelo]], [[Guimarães]] and some other towns.

The style was extended to the decorative arts and spread throughout the [[Portuguese Empire]], to the islands of the [[Azores]], [[Madeira]], enclaves in [[North Africa]], [[Colonial Brazil|Brazil]], [[Goa]] in [[Portuguese India]] and even [[Portuguese Macau|Macau]], China. Its influence is apparent in southern Spain, the Canary Islands, North Africa and the former Spanish colonies of Peru and Mexico.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2441">'''Mattenenglisch''', in [[Bernese German|Bernese German Dialect]] '''Mattenänglisch''', is a name for the varieties traditionally spoken in the ''Matte'', the old [[working class]] neighbourhood of the [[Swiss]] City of [[Bern]]. It is used in two different senses: Either for the traditional [[sociolect]] of that neighbourhood or for a special kind of [[Pig Latin]] that was used there. In the second half of the 20th century, both have fallen out of use because after the traditional [[social stratification]] has been completely changed, the ''Matte'' is no longer a working-class neighbourhood. However, there are [[voluntary association]]s that cultivate Mattenenglisch.

==Mattenenglisch sociolect==
The Mattenenglisch sociolect was the working class variety of the [[Bernese German]] dialect. It had a characteristic [[vocabulary]] that was partly influenced by varieties such as [[Rotwelsch]], [[Yeniche (people)|Jenisch]] or [[Yiddish]], because people wanted to communicate in a way the police would not understand. While most Mattenenglisch words have fallen out of use, some have spread into common Bernese German usage, thus becoming [[shibboleth]]s of Bernese German, for instance the words ''jiu'' 'yes', ''Modi'' 'girl' or ''Gieu'' 'boy'.

==Mattenenglisch Pig Latin==
Until the mid 20th century, a special variety of [[Pig Latin]] was used by the kids in the ''Matte'' neighbourhood. Unlike in other varieties of Pig Latin, the first vowel of the word is completely substituted.

The rules are as follows:

#For words that begin with [[consonant]] sounds, move the initial consonant or [[consonant cluster]] to the end of the word, add ''ee'' and change the first vowel into ''i''. Examples:
#* Mueter 'mother' → ''Ieter-mee''
#* gib-ere 'give-her' → ''ibere-gee''
#* Schnure 'mouth' → ''Ire-schnee''
#For words that begin with [[vowel]] sounds, add the syllable ''ee'' to the end of the word, or ''hee'' if the word ends in a vowel, and change the first vowel into ''i''. Examples:
#* Änglisch 'English' → ''Inglisch-ee''
#* Öpfu 'apple' → ''Ipfu-hee''

'''Mikhail Bulgakov Museum''' (officially known as '''Literature-Memorial Museum to Mikhail Bulgakov''', commonly called the '''Bulgakov House''' or '''Lystovnychyi House''') is a museum in [[Kiev]], [[Ukraine]], dedicated to Kiev-born [[Russian literature|Russian writer]] [[Mikhail Bulgakov]].

Commenced in February 1989, and opened on May 15, 1991, for the 100th anniversary of the writer's birth, the museum is located at №13 on the [[Andriyivskyy Descent]] and contains an exposition of nearly 2500 pieces that include Bulgakov's belongings, books, postcards, and photos - conveying the life and creativity of the writer and his surroundings. The atmosphere of the house reflects the writer's life - as a secondary school pupil, student of medicine, family doctor, and writer—when Bulgakov wrote ''[[The White Guard]]'', ''[[The Master and Margarita]]'', and ''Theatre Love Story''.

The building itself, erected in 1888 and designed by architect N. Gardenin, was thoroughly renovated before the opening of the museum. A memorial plaque with Bulgakov's portrait now hangs on the front of the building. ''[[The White Guard]]'' novel makes vivid references to the Andriyivskyy Descent, and the current plaque of the address at №13 displays the street name the writer used in his book (№13 Andreevsky spusk). Inna Konchakovskaia (1902–85), daughter of the owner (who was a hero of that Bulgakov novel) and niece of composer [[Witold Maliszewski]], preserved this unique house for [[Kiev]] in the hard Soviet times [http://www.day.kiev.ua/290590/].

The museum staff conducts considerable studies and research, publishes unreleased material, and holds book-club meetings.

In June 2014, the museum posted the following announcement: "All persons supportive of the [[Russian military intervention in Ukraine (2014–present)|military occupation of Ukraine]] are discouraged from visiting the museum - The Mikhail Bulgakov Museum Administration."&lt;ref&gt;http://izvestia.kiev.ua/article/69921&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Minha formação''''' (''My Formation'' or ''My Education'') is the autobiography of [[Joaquim Nabuco]], a Brazilian writer, diplomat and abolitionist. First published in 1900, it is often cited as a classic of [[Brazilian literature]].

The autobiography includes an account of the slave-holding society in 19th-century Brazil and of the author's travels in Europe and America, as well as extensive digressions on philosophy, politics and abolitionism. It describes his encounters with [[Pope Leo XIII]], [[George Sand]] and [[Ernest Renan]].

'''''My Sister and I''''' is an [[apocrypha]]l work attributed to German [[philosophy|philosopher]] [[Friedrich Nietzsche]].  Following Nietzsche scholar [[Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|Walter Kaufmann]], most consider the work to be a [[literary forgery]],&lt;ref name=dutton&gt;{{cite web|url=http://denisdutton.com/nietzsche_review.htm|title=Denis Dutton on the fake Nietzsche autobiography, ''My Sister and I''|publisher=''Philosophy and Literature''|accessdate=12 March 2012|year=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=amok&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amokbooks.com/books/fnsister.html|title=amok books: catalog: ''My Sister and I''|publisher=Amok Books|accessdate=12 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=diski&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lrb.co.uk/v25/n18/jenny-diski/it-wasnt-him-it-was-her|title=Jenny Diski reviews ''Nietzsche's Sister's Will to Power'' by Carol Diethe|publisher=''London Review of Books''|accessdate=12 March 2012|date=25 September 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; although a small minority argues for the book's authenticity.&lt;ref name=stewart&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.authorsden.com/visit/viewwork.asp?AuthorID=9158&amp;id=19942|title=''Nietzsche – My Sister and I: A Critical Study'' (book) by Walter K. Stewart on AuthorsDen|publisher=AuthorsDen|accessdate=12 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was supposedly written in 1889 or early 1890 during Nietzsche's stay in a mental asylum in the [[Thuringia]]n city of [[Jena]].  If legitimate, ''My Sister and I'' would be Nietzsche's second autobiographical and final overall work, chronologically following his ''Wahnbriefe'' (''Madness Letters''), written during his extended time of mental collapse.  ''My Sister and I'' makes several bold and otherwise unreported biographical claims, most notably of an [[incest]]uous relationship between Nietzsche and his sister [[Elisabeth Förster-Nietzsche]], as well as an affair with [[Richard Wagner]]'s wife [[Cosima Wagner|Cosima]]. It is written in a style that combines anecdote and [[aphorism]] in a manner similar to other [[Friedrich Nietzsche bibliography|Nietzsche works]].

==History==
''My Sister and I'' was first published in 1951 by Boar's Head Books and distributed by Seven Sirens Press in [[New York City]]. Along with Nietzsche's authorship attribution, the translation from German was credited to noted early Nietzsche scholar [[Oscar Levy]].

The book was tied quickly to controversial publisher [[Samuel Roth]], the putative owner of Seven Sirens, who had spent jail time for the unlawful distribution of a version of [[James Joyce]]'s ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'' (1922).&lt;ref name=dutton /&gt;  In the book's introduction, an anonymous publisher claimed to have received the manuscript from a fellow inmate of Nietzsche's in Jena and to have hired Levy to translate the work only to have both German and English manuscripts confiscated, with only the latter surviving.

In a response letter, Levy's daughter vehemently denied her father's involvement with ''My Sister and I''.&lt;ref name=dutton /&gt; Kaufmann claimed in a footnote in his ''[[Nietzsche: Philosopher, Psychologist, Antichrist]]'' (first published 1950) to have received a [[ghostwriter|ghostwriting]] confession from minor author David George Plotkin in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;Kaufmann, Walter. ''Nietzsche: Philosopher, Psychologist, Antichrist''. Princeton University Press, 2013, p. 503.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Nietzsche scholars in general adopted the opinion of Kaufmann, who immediately identified the book as a forgery in a 1952 article.&lt;ref name=dutton /&gt;  Evidence against the book cited both by Kaufmann and later commentators includes chronologically unsound information, such as a reference to an 1898 incident, incongruous references to [[Marxism]] and the city of [[Detroit]] (globally unknown in the late 19th century), a seemingly poor grasp of philosophy, and the book's sexualized [[pulp magazine|pulpy]] content.&lt;ref name=dutton /&gt;&lt;ref name=diski /&gt; Kaufmann also notes instances of clever wordplay in this English text that are impossible to express as such in the German language. Since the only copy of this alleged work is in English, and there was never a single page of what would have been his original in German, opinion has been largely that the work is a forgery.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

Nevertheless, a minority holds the work to be authentic.  Beginning in the mid-1980s, a handful of articles began to call for its reevaluation, including references to more recently discovered journals and letters from Nietzsche and Cosima Wagner.  Amok Books' 1990 edition reprints many secondary articles on the subject, and includes an original introduction calling for a reevaluation of the book.  Nietzsche scholar Walter K. Stewart, in his 185 page monograph ''Nietzsche: ''My Sister and I'' — A Critical Study'' published in 2007, argues for the original's potential legitimacy by conducting a point-by-point analysis of Kaufmann's book review.&lt;ref name=stewart /&gt;  In his 2011 followup, ''Friedrich Nietzsche ''My Sister and I'': Investigation, Analysis, Interpretation'', Stewart uses direct textual analysis to argue that whoever wrote ''My Sister and I'' was intimate with every aspect of Nietzsche’s life and perspective.

'''The National Library of Iran''' (NLI) is located in [[Tehran]], [[Iran]], with several branches scattered throughout the city.

Prior to the library's official inauguration in 1937, other libraries existed that performed the same function informally. The first prototype of a [[national library]] in Iran was the Library of [[Dar ul-Funun (Persia)|Dar al-Funun College]], established in 1851. In 1899, another library called the "Nation's Library" was inaugurated in [[Tehran]].&lt;ref&gt;Murray, S. (2009). The library : an illustrated history / Stuart A.P. Murray ; introduction by Donald G. Davis, Jr. ; foreword by Nicholas A. Basbanes. New York, NY : [[Skyhorse Pub.]] ; Chicago : ALA Editions, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The present National Library of Iran incorporates many different collections from older libraries, including many rare and valuable [[manuscript]]s. The central main branch is located in north central Tehran.

The new building is specially designed to combine different faculties of the library in a single platform. The library by itself is over 90,000&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, the largest library campus in the Middle East. It encompasses 5 separate halls, each hall dedicated to a different faculty, including Humanities, Social Sciences, Law, Science and Science Education, and Health Studies.

It took over the publishing of the ''[[Iranian National Bibliography]]'' (''Ketab Shenasi Melli Iran''), with annual publications between 1962 and 1966, a break for two years, and then monthly and quartly since 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Libraries in the East: an International and Comparative Study | chapter = Iran | pages = 39–50 | author = George Chandler | year = 1971 | publisher = [[Seminar Press]] | isbn = 0-12-815550-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | encyclopedia = Encyclopedia of Library and Information Science | editor = [[Allen Kent]] |editor2=Harold Lancour |editor3=Jay E.

&lt;onlyinclude&gt;The '''open-source-software movement''' is a movement that supports the use of [[open-source licenses]] for some or all software, a part of the broader notion of [[open collaboration]].&lt;ref name="doi.org"&gt;Levine, Sheen S., &amp; Prietula, M. J. (2013). [https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1096442 Open Collaboration for Innovation: Principles and Performance]. ''Organization Science'', {{DOI|10.1287/orsc.2013.0872}}&lt;/ref&gt; The open-source movement was started to spread the concept/idea of [[open-source software]].
[[Programmer]]s who support the open-source-movement philosophy contribute to the open-source community by voluntarily writing and exchanging programming code for [[software development]].&lt;ref name="Wyllys2000"&gt;Wyllys, R.E. (2000). [http://www.ischool.utexas.edu/~l38613dw/readings/OpenSourceOverview.html Overview of the Open-Source Movement]. Retrieved November 22, 2009, from The University of Texas at Austin Graduate School of Library &amp; Information Science&lt;/ref&gt; The term "open source" requires that no one can discriminate against a group in not sharing the edited code or hinder others from editing their already-edited work. This approach to software development allows anyone to obtain and modify open-source code. These modifications are distributed back to the developers within the open-source community of people who are working with the software. In this way, the identities of all individuals participating in code modification are disclosed and the transformation of the code is documented over time.&lt;ref name="ref_e_Warger"&gt;Warger, T.

=== Evolution ===
In the beginning, a difference between hardware and software did not exist. The user and programmer of a computer were one and the same. When the first commercial electronic computer was introduced by [[IBM]] in 1952, the machine was hard to maintain and expensive. Putting the price of the machine aside, it was the software that caused the problem when owning one of these computers. Then in 1952, a collaboration of all the owners of the computer got together and created a set of tools. The collaboration of people were in a group called PACT (The Project for the Advancement of Coding techniques). After passing this hurdle, in 1956, the Eisenhower administration decided to put restrictions on the types of sales [[AT&amp;T]] could make. This did not stop the inventors from developing new ideas of how to bring the computer to the mass population. The next step was making the computer more affordable which slowly developed through different companies. Then they had to develop software that would host multiple users. [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] computation center developed one of the first systems, CTSS (Compatible Time-Sharing System). This laid the foundation for many more systems, and what we now call the open-source software movement.&lt;ref&gt;Weber, Steven. The Success of Open Source. The President and Fellows of Harvard College. 2004. Print pg.20–28. {{ISBN|9780674018587}} This whole paragraph is referenced to Steven Weber&lt;/ref&gt;

The open-source movement is branched from the [[free-software movement]] which began in the late 80s with the launching of the GNU project by [[Richard Stallman]].&lt;ref name="ref_e_Tennant"&gt;Tennant, D. (2008, August 11). Standing on Principle. Computerworld, p. 4. Retrieved from Business Source Premier database.&lt;/ref&gt; Stallman is regarded within the open-source community as sharing a key role in the conceptualization of freely-shared source code for software development.&lt;ref name="ref_e_Warger" /&gt; The term "[[free software]]" in the free software movement is meant to imply freedom of software exchange and modification. The term does not refer to any monetary freedom.&lt;ref name="ref_e_Warger" /&gt; Both the free-software movement and the open-source movement share this view of free exchange of [[source code|programming code]], and this is often why both of the movements are sometimes referenced in literature as part of the [[FOSS]] or "Free and Open Software" or [[FLOSS]] "Free/Libre Open-Source" communities.

These movements share fundamental differences in the view on open software. The main, factionalizing difference between the groups is the relationship between open-source and proprietary software. Often, makers of [[proprietary software]], such as [[Microsoft]], may make efforts to support open-source software to remain competitive.&lt;ref name="ref_a1"&gt;Taft, D. K. (2009, November 3). [http://www.eweek.com/c/a/Linux-and-Open-Source/Microsoft-Recommits-100K-Apache-Contribution-at- Microsoft Recommits to $100k Apache Contribution at ApacheCon]{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}. Retrieved November 22, 2009 from eWeek&lt;/ref&gt; Members of the open-source community are willing to coexist with the makers of proprietary software&lt;ref name="ref_e_Warger" /&gt; and feel that the issue of whether software is open source is a matter of practicality.&lt;ref name="ref_e_Elliott"&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1108/09593840810860315|author=Elliott, M.

In contrast, members of the free-software community maintain the vision that all software is a part of freedom of speech&lt;ref name="ref_e_Warger" /&gt; and that proprietary software is unethical and unjust.&lt;ref name="ref_e_Warger" /&gt; The free-software movement openly champions this belief through talks that denounce proprietary software. As a whole, the community refuses to support proprietary software. Further there are external motivations for these developers. One motivation is that, when a programmer fixes a bug or makes a program it benefits others in an open-source environment. Another motivation is that a programmer can work on multiple projects that they find interesting and enjoyable. Programming in the open-source world can also lead to commercial job offers or entrance into the venture capital community. These are just a few reasons why open-source programmers continue to create and advance software.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Lerner | first1 = Josh | last2 = Tirole | first2 = Jean | citeseerx = 10.1.1.145.3577 | title = The simple Economics of Open Source | publisher = National Bureau of Economic Research | location = Cambridge, MA. |date=March 2000|url=http://www.people.hbs.edu/jlerner/simple.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While cognizant of the fact that both, the free-software movement and the open-source movement, share similarities in practical recommendations regarding open source, the free-software movement fervently continues to distinguish themselves from the open-source movement entirely.&lt;ref name="ref_e_Stallman"&gt;Stallman, R. M. (2007). [https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-software-for-freedom.html#relationship Why "Free Software" is better than "Open Source"]. Retrieved November 22, 2009, from GNU.org&lt;/ref&gt; The free-software movement maintains that it has fundamentally different attitudes towards the relationship between open-source and proprietary software. The free-software community does not view the open-source community as their target grievance, however. Their target grievance is proprietary software itself.&lt;ref name="ref_e_Warger" /&gt;

== Legal issues ==
The open-source movement has faced a number of legal challenges. Companies that manage open-source products have some difficulty securing their trademarks.
For example, the scope of "[[implied license]]" conjecture remains unclear and can compromise an enterprise’s ability to patent productions made with open-source software. Another example is the case of companies offering add-ons for purchase; licensees who make additions to the open-source code that are similar to those for purchase may have immunity from patent suits.

In the court case "[[Jacobsen v. Katzer]]", the plaintiff sued the defendant for failing to put the required attribution notices in his modified version of the software, thereby violating license. The defendant claimed Artistic License in not adhering to the conditions of the software’s use, but the wording of the attribution notice decided that this was not the case. "Jacobsen v Katzer" established open-source software’s equality to proprietary software in the eyes of the law.

In a court case accusing Microsoft of being a monopoly, Linux and open-source software was introduced in court to prove that Microsoft had valid competitors and was grouped in with [[Apple Inc.|Apple]].

There are resources available for those involved open-source projects in need of legal advice. The [[Software Freedom Law Center]] features a primer on open-source legal issues. International Free and Open Source Software Law Review offers peer-reviewed information for lawyers on free-software issues.

== Formalization ==
The [[Open Source Initiative]] (OSI) was instrumental in the formalization of the open-source movement. The OSI was founded by Eric Raymond and Bruce Perens in February 1998 with the purpose of providing general education and advocacy of the open-source label through the creation of the Open Source Definition that was based on the Debian Free Software Guidelines. The OSI has become one of the main supporters and advocators of the open-source movement.&lt;ref name="osihis" /&gt;

In February 1998, the open-source movement was adopted, formalized, and spearheaded by the Open Source Initiative (OSI), an organization formed to market software "as something more amenable to commercial business use"&lt;ref name="ref_e_Warger" /&gt; The OSI owns the trademark "[[Open Source]]"&lt;ref name="Wyllys2000" /&gt;
The main tool they adopted for this was [[The Open Source Definition]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opensource.org/docs/osd The Open Source Definition | Open Source Initiative]. Opensource.org. Retrieved on 2011-11-30.&lt;/ref&gt;

The open-source label was conceived at a strategy session that was held on February 3, 1998 in Palo Alto, California and on April 8 of the same year, the attendees of Tim O’Reilly’s Free Software Summit voted to promote the use of the term "open source".&lt;ref name="osihis" /&gt;

Overall, the software developments that have come out of the open-source movement have not been unique to the computer-science field, but they have been successful in developing alternatives to propriety software. Members of the open-source community improve upon code and write programs that can rival much of the propriety software that is already available.&lt;ref name="ref_e_Warger" /&gt;

The rhetorical discourse used in open-source movements is now being broadened to include a larger group of non-expert users as well as advocacy organizations. Several organized groups such as the Creative Commons and global development agencies have also adopted the open-source concepts according to their own aims and for their own purposes.&lt;ref name="Sullivan"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Sullivan | first1 = J | year = 2011 | title = Free, open source software advocacy as a social justice movement: The expansion of f/oss movement discourse in the 21st century | url = http://0-web.ebscohost.com.sculib.scu.edu/ehost/detail?vid=6&amp;hid=13&amp;sid=1e9455bd-5edf-4fc0-b488-4d51dea57b18@sessionmgr14&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ== | journal = Journal of Information Technology and Politics | volume = 8 | issue = 3 }}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The factors affecting the open-source movement’s legal formalization are primarily based on recent political discussion over copyright, appropriation, and intellectual property.&lt;ref name="Ceraso"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Ceraso | first1 = A. | last2 = Pruchnic | first2 = J. | year = 2011 | title = Introduction: Open source culture and aesthetics | url = http://0-web.ebscohost.com.sculib.scu.edu/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=1fd44938-590d-49ad-ba64-f14479220da9@sessionmgr13&amp;vid=4&amp;hid=13 | journal = Criticism | volume = 53 | issue = 3 | page = 337 | doi = 10.1353/crt.2011.0026 }}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Individuals who have intrinsic interest in code writing and software creation motivate the development of open-source software within the community. This differs from proprietary software, the development of which is often motivated through potential monetary gains.&lt;ref name="Foran" /&gt;

* Globalization of Market

The open-source movement has allowed smaller businesses to participate in the global economy. Before, smaller businesses did not have access to the software needed to participate or compete in the global market.  It was the larger corporations, the producers of the networks and software who had the power. "That is, individuals who have access to the software needed to create, organize, or distribute content can plug into and participate in the global community".&lt;ref name="St.AmantBallentine"&gt;Kirk St.Amant &amp; Brian D. Ballentine (http://0-web.ebscohost.com.sculib.scu.edu/ehost/detail?sid=7f13174d-c614-4ff9-a68d-b5336a49c866%40sessionmgr14&amp;vid=7&amp;hid=25{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }})&lt;/ref&gt; The creation of the open-source movement has created "a degree of global computing access that might have been unthinkable in a world where proprietary was the only option."&lt;ref name="St.AmantBallentine" /&gt; Individuals or organizations with access to an open source had the means needed to develop technical material for a variety of consumers. The open-source movement created equal opportunities for people all over the world to participate in the global economy.

Members of the open-source movement stress the importance of differentiating between open-source software and free software.  Although the two issues are related, they are quite different. The open-source movement and the free-software movement are different, but they work together. Both movements strive for freedom of the Internet and dislike the idea of ownership over a website.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Elliott|first=Margaret S.|title=Institute for Software Research|url=http://www.emeraldinsight.com/journals.htm?issn=0959-3845&amp;volume=21&amp;issue=1&amp;articleid=1711318&amp;show=html&amp;PHPSESSID=fa8ta0bphk80ag9kneso9v4mt6|publisher=University of California|accessdate=2012-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For both open-source and free software, one can find the source code and executable component easily and for free online.  The largest difference is that free software requires any changes to be submitted to the original maker for redistribution, and any derivative software must also be distributed as free software. This is mainly to keep companies from making minor changes to free software and redistributing it as their own, for a price.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=West|first=Joel|title=How open is open enough?: Melding proprietary and open source platform strategies|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048733303000520|work=Research Policy| pages =1259–1285|publisher=Elsevier B.V.|accessdate=6 February 2012|doi=10.1016/S0048-7333(03)00052-0|volume=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A major advantage to open-source code is the ability for a variety of different people to edit and fix problems and errors that have occurred. Naturally, because there are more people who can edit the material, there are more people who can help make the information more credible and reliable.
The open-source mission statement promises better quality, higher reliability, more flexibility, lower cost, and an end to predatory [[vendor lock-in]]. They stress the importance of maintaining the Open Source Definition. This trademark creates a trusted group that connects all users and developers together.&lt;ref&gt;Poynder, R. (n.d.). [http://www.infotoday.com/it/oct01/ IT Feature: The Open Source Movement]. Information Today, Inc.. Retrieved January 25, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; To fully understand the Open Source Definition, one must understand certain terms: Free redistribution means that there is no restriction on any party to sell or give away the software to third parties. Source Code means that the program must efficiently publicize the means of obtaining the source code. Derived works means that the program must allow certain works to be distributed under the same terms. There must be a promise of no discriminating against any certain persons or groups. All of these factors allow for the open-source movement to become available to all and easy to access, which is their overall mission.
The latest updates from the Open Source Institution took place on January 19, 2011: The OSI collaborated with the Free Software Foundation and together they updated a version of the request that they have sent to the US Department of Justice.&lt;ref&gt;Wyllys, R.

== Drawbacks ==
* The structure of the open-source community requires that individuals have programming expertise in order to engage in open-code modification and exchange. Individuals interested in supporting the open-source movement may lack this skill set, but there are many other ways of contributing.&lt;ref name="ref_e_Warger" /&gt;
* Programmers and developers comprise a large percentage of the open-source community and sought-out technical support and/or documentation may not be useful or clear to open-source software lay-users.&lt;ref name="Foran" /&gt;
* The structure of the open-source community is one that involves contributions of multiple developers and programmers; software produced in this fashion may lack standardization and compatibility with various computer applications and capabilities.&lt;ref name="Foran" /&gt;
* Production can be very limited. Programmers that create open-source software often can turn their attention elsewhere very quickly. This opens the door for many bug-filled programs and applications out there. Because no one is paid to create it, many projects are never completed.&lt;ref name="Advantages and Disadvantages of Open Source Software"&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.softwarecompany.org/advantages-open-source-software.html | title=Advantages and Disadvantages of Open Source Software | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120110223813/http://www.softwarecompany.org/advantages-open-source-software.html | archive-date=2012-01-10 | deadurl=yes | df= }}.

Pearson Education. 2005 {{ISBN|9780321268532}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Librarians may not be equipped to take on this new responsibility of technologies.&lt;ref name="infotoday" /&gt;
* There is no guarantee that development will happen. It is unknown if an open-source project will become usable, especially when a project is started without significant support from one or more organizations. Even if the project does reach a usable stage, it is possible the project can die if there is not enough funding or interest toward it.
* It is sometimes difficult to know that a project exists, and its current status. Especially for open-source projects without significant support, there is not much advertising involved in open-source software.
* The amount of support for an open-source project varies highly. The available support for open-source software is predominantly self-motivated discussions found on the Internet, sometimes moderated by a core group of contributors. The amount of documentation or guides for an open-source project also varies highly. More popular or company-backed projects often have more detailed and maintained documentation. However, as open-source projects are regularly changing, documentation can easily fall out of date.
* There is no guarantee of updates. Although open-source software is available to anyone for free, regular updates are not assured since users do not pay for its use.
* Beyond the obvious detriments towards the theoretical success of open-source software, there are several factors that contribute to the lack of long-term success in open-source projects. One of the most obvious drawback is that without pay or royalty licensing, there is little financial incentive for a programmer to become involved with a project in the first place, or to continue development and support once the initial product is released. This leads to innumerable examples of well-anticipated software being forever condemned to beta versions and unsupported early model products. With donations as the only source of income for a truly open-source (and GPL-licensed) project, there is almost no certainty in the future of the project simply because of developer abandonment, making it a poor choice for any sort of application in which future versions, support and a long-term plan would be essential, as is the case for most business software.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090309020736/http://www.techsoup.org/learningcenter/software/archives/page9905.cfm Going With Open Source Software].

* Organizations with enterprise agreements still pay licensing agreements even if they choose to run alternative open-source software. Therefore, many organizations are unlikely to consider using alternative products. As a cost-saving method of using Microsoft products, many large corporations use enterprise agreements and therefore pay a single company wide IT licensing fee, at lower cost per product. "Organizations with EAs that are interested in alternative products can benefit from the gap-filler scenario, but only after they drop Microsoft Office from their EA at the next renewal and final true-up."&lt;ref&gt;[http://my.gartner.com/portal/server.pt?open=512&amp;objID=260&amp;mode=2&amp;PageID=3460702&amp;resId=1874316&amp;ref=QuickSearch&amp;sthkw=open+source+movement]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Motivations of programmers ==
{{See also |Motivations for online participation}}
With the growth and attention on the open-source movement, the reasons and motivations of programmers for creating code for free has been under investigation. In a paper from the 15th Annual Congress of the European Economic Association on the open-source movement, the incentives of programmers on an individual level as well as on a company or network level were analyzed. What is essentially the intellectual gift giving of talented programmers challenges the "self-interested-economic-agent paradigm,"&lt;ref name=Lerner&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lerner|first=Josh|author2=Jean Tirole|title=The open source movement: Key research questions|journal=European Economic Review|date=9 May 2001|volume=45|issue=4–6|pages=819–826|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0014292101001246|accessdate=7 February 2012|doi=10.1016/S0014-2921(01)00124-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has made both the public and economists search for an understanding of what the benefits are for programmers.
* '''Altruism''': The argument for altruism is limited as an explanation because though some exists, the programmers do not focus their kindness on more charitable causes.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018|reason=This claim is not based on empirical data but on the speculations of Lerner et al., which are not supported by any empirical evidence (how did this ever pass peer-review?). The claim should either be supported by empirical data, or the information on Wikipedia should be rephrased for clarity.}} If the generosity of working for free was a viable motivation for such a prevalent movement, it is curious why such a trend has not been seen in industries such as biotechnology that would have a much bigger impact on the public good.&lt;ref name="Lerner" /&gt;
* '''Community sharing and improvement''': The online community is an environment that promotes continual improvements, modifications, and contributions to each other's work. A programmer can easily benefit from open-source software because by making it public, other testers and subprograms can remove bugs, tailor code to other purposes, and find problems. This kind of peer-editing feature of open-source software promotes better programs and a higher standard of code.&lt;ref name="Lerner" /&gt;
* '''Recognition''': Though a project may not be associated with a specific individual, the contributors are often recognized and marked on a project's server or awarded [[Reputation system|social reputation]]. This allows for programmers to receive public recognition for their skills, promoting career opportunities and exposure. In fact, the founders of [[Sun Microsystems]] and [[Netscape]] began as open-source programmers.&lt;ref name="Lerner" /&gt;
* '''Ego''': "If they are somehow assigned to a trivial problem and that is their only possible task, they may spend six months coming up with a bewildering architecture...merely to show their friends and colleagues what a tough nut they are trying to crack."&lt;ref name=Greenspun&gt;{{Cite web|last=Greenspun|first=Philip|title=Managing Software Engineers|url=http://philip.greenspun.com/ancient-history/managing-software-engineers|accessdate=7 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ego-gratification has been cited as a relevant motivation of programmers because of their competitive community.&lt;ref name=Greenspun /&gt;  An OSS (open-source software) community has no clear distinction between developers and users, because all users are potential developers. There is a large community of programmers trying to essentially outshine or impress their colleagues.&lt;ref name=ye&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ye|first=Yunwen|author2=Kouichi Kishida|title=Toward an Understanding of the Motivation of Open Source Software Developers|journal=International Conference of Software Engineering|date=3–10 May 2003|url=http://l3d.cs.colorado.edu/~yunwen/papers/ICSE03.pdf|accessdate=7 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They enjoy having other programmers admire their works and accomplishments, contributing to why OSS projects have a recruiting advantage for unknown talent than a closed-source company.&lt;ref name=Greenspun /&gt;

== Gender diversity of programmers ==
The vast majority of programmers in open-source communities are male. In a study for the European Union on free and open-source software communities, researchers found that only 1.5% of all contributors are female.&lt;ref&gt;Nafus, Dawn, James Leach, and Bernhard Krieger. "Gender: Integrated report of findings." ''FLOSSPOLS, Deliverable D'' 16 (2006).&lt;/ref&gt; Although women are generally underrepresented in computing, the percentage of women in tech professions is actually much higher, close to 25%.&lt;ref&gt;Ashcraft, Catherine, Brad McLain, and Elizabeth Eger. "Women in tech: The facts." (2016).&lt;/ref&gt; This discrepancy suggests that female programs are overall less likely than male programmers to participate in open-source projects.

Some research and interviews with members of open-source projects have described a male-dominated culture within open-source communities that can be unwelcoming or hostile towards females.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Nafus, Dawn. "‘Patches don’t have gender’: What is not open in open source software." ''New Media &amp; Society'' 14, no. 4 (2012): 669-683.&lt;/ref&gt; There are an initiatives such as [[Outreachy]] that aim to support more women and other underrepresented gender identities to participate in open-source software. However, within the discussion forums of open-source projects the topic of gender diversity can be highly controversial and even inflammatory.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A central vision in open-source software is that because the software is built and maintained on the merit of individual code contributions, open-source communities should act as a meritocracy.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Vasilescu, Bogdan, Daryl Posnett, Baishakhi Ray, Mark GJ van den Brand, Alexander Serebrenik, Premkumar Devanbu, and Vladimir Filkov. "Gender and tenure diversity in GitHub teams." In ''Proceedings of the 33rd Annual ACM Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems'', pp. 3789-3798. ACM, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; In a meritocracy, the importance of an individual in the community depends on the quality of their individual contributions and not demographic factors such as age, race, religion, or gender. Thus proposing changes to the community based on gender, for example, to make the community more inviting towards females, go against the ideal of a meritocracy by targeting certain programmers by gender and no based on their skill alone.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

There is evidence that gender does impact a programmer’s perceived merit in the community. A 2016 study identified the gender of over one million programmers on [[GitHub]], by linking the programmer’s [[GitHub]] account to their other social media accounts.&lt;ref&gt;Terrell, Josh, Andrew Kofink, Justin Middleton, Clarissa Rainear, Emerson Murphy-Hill, Chris Parnin, and Jon Stallings. ''Gender differences and bias in open source: Pull request acceptance of women versus men''. No. e1733v2. PeerJ Preprints, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Between male and female programmers, the researchers found that female programmers were actually ''more'' ''likely'' to have their pull requests accepted into the project than male programmers, however only when the female had a gender-neutral profile. When females had profiles with a name or image that identified them as female, they were less likely than male programmers to have their pull requests accepted. Another study in 2015 found that of open-source projects on GitHub, gender diversity was a significant positive predictor of a team's productivity, meaning that open-source teams with a more even mix of different genders tended to be more highly productive.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Evidence of open-source adoption ==
{{Main |Free and open-source software#Adoption}}

Libraries are using open-source software to develop information as well as library services. The purpose of open source is to provide a software that is cheaper, reliable and has better quality. The one feature that makes this software so sought after is that it is free. Libraries in particular benefit from this movement because of the resources it provides. They also promote the same ideas of learning and understanding new information through the resources of other people. Open source allows a sense of community. It is an invitation for anyone to provide information about various topics. The open-source tools even allow libraries to create web-based catalogs. According to the IT source there are various library programs that benefit from this.&lt;ref name="infotoday"&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Poynder, Richard|year=2001|url=http://www.infotoday.com/it/oct01/poynder.htm |title=The Open Source Movement|journal=Information Today|volume= 8|issue= 9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Government agencies and infrastructure software''' — Government Agencies are utilizing open-source infrastructure software, like the Linux operating system and the Apache Web-server into software, to manage information.&lt;ref name="ref_a2"&gt;Moore, J. (2008, August 14). A Starring Role for Open Source. Retrieved November 22, 2009, from Federal Computer Week: http://fcw.com/articles/2008/08/14/a-starring-role-for-open-source.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2005, a new government lobby was launched under the name National Center for Open Source Policy and Research (NCOSPR) "a non-profit organization promoting the use of open source software solutions within government IT enterprises."&lt;ref&gt;Chris Preimesberger [http://www.eweek.com/c/a/Linux-and-Open-Source/Open-Source-Movement-Gets-a-Lobby/ Open Source Movement Gets a Lobby]. eWeek. 14 October 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Open-source movement in the military''' — Open-source movement has potential to help in the military. The open-source software allows anyone to make changes that will improve it. This is a form of invitation for people to put their minds together to grow a software in a cost efficient manner. The reason the military is so interested is because it is possible that this software can increase speed and flexibility. Although there are security setbacks to this idea due to the fact that anyone has access to change the software, the advantages can outweigh the disadvantages. The fact that the open-source programs can be modified quickly is crucial.
A support group was formed to test these theories. The [[Mil-OSS|Military Open Source Software Working Group]] was organized in 2009 and held over 120 military members. Their purpose was to bring together software developers and contractors from the military to discover new ideas for reuse and collaboration. Overall, open-source software in the military is an intriguing idea that has potential drawbacks but they are not enough to offset the advantages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Toon|first=John|year=2009|url=http://www.gtri.gatech.edu/casestudy/open-source-mil-oss-military-software|title=Open Source Movement May Accelerate Military Software Development|publisher=[[Georgia Tech Research Institute]]|accessdate=2011-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Open source in education''' — Colleges and organizations use software predominantly online to educate their students. Open-source technology is being adopted by many institutions because it can save these institutions from paying companies to provide them with these administrative software systems. One of the first major colleges to adopt an open-source system was Colorado State University in 2009 with many others following after that. Colorado State Universities system was produced by the [[Kuali]] Foundation who has become a major player in open-source administrative systems. The Kuali Foundation defines itself as a group of organizations that aims to "build and sustain open-source software for higher education, by higher education."  There are many other examples of open-source instruments being used in education other than the Kuali Foundation as well.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kuali.org/about/ About]. www.kuali.org. Retrieved on 2011-11-30.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
"For educators, The Open Source Movement allowed access to software that could be used in teaching students how to apply the theories they were learning".&lt;ref&gt;St.Amant &amp; Ballentine 2011 p.343&lt;/ref&gt; With open networks and software, teachers are able to share lessons, lectures, and other course materials within a community. OpenTechComm is a program that is dedicated to "open access, open use, and open edits- text book or pedagogical resource that teachers of technical and professional communication courses at every level can rely on to craft free offerings to their students."&lt;ref&gt;Still (http://0-web.ebscohost.com.sculib.scu.edu/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=7f13174d-c614-4ff9-a68d-b5336a49c866%40sessionmgr14&amp;vid=4&amp;hid=25{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }})&lt;/ref&gt; As stated earlier, access to programs like this would be much more cost efficient for educational departments.

'''Open source in healthcare''' — Created in June 2009 by the nonprofit eHealthNigeria, the open-source software OpenMRS is used to document health care in Nigeria. The use of this software began in Kaduna, Nigeria to serve the purpose of public health. OpenMRS manages features such as alerting health care workers when patients show warning signs for conditions and records births and deaths daily, among other features. The success of this software is caused by its ease of use for those first being introduced to the technology, compared to more complex proprietary healthcare software available in first world countries. This software is community-developed and can be used freely by anyone, characteristic of open-source applications. So far, OpenMRS is being used in Rwanda, Mozambique, Haiti, India, China, and the Philippines.&lt;ref&gt;eHealthNigeria. (2012). [http://ehealthnigeria.org/home/faq/ eHealthNigeria: FAQs] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120104064547/http://ehealthnigeria.org/home/faq/# |date=2012-01-04 }}. Retrieved Feb 4, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The impact of open source in healthcare is also observed by Apelon Inc, the "leading provider of terminology and data interoperability solutions". Recently, its Distributed Terminology System (Open DTS) began supporting the open-source MySQL database system. This essentially allows for open-source software to be used in healthcare, lessening the dependence on expensive proprietary healthcare software. Due to open-source software, the healthcare industry has available a free open-source solution to implement healthcare standards. Not only does open source benefit healthcare economically, but the lesser dependence on proprietary software allows for easier integration of various systems, regardless of the developer.&lt;ref&gt;(2012, Jan 17).

'''[[Microsoft]]''' — Before summer of 2008, Microsoft has generally been known as an enemy of the open-source community{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}. The company’s anti-open-source sentiment was enforced by former CEO [[Steve Ballmer]], who referred to Linux, a widely-used open-source software, as a "malignant cancer". Microsoft also threatened Linux that they would charge royalties for violating 235 of their patents.
In 2004, Microsoft lost a European Union court case,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.groklaw.net/articlebasic.php?story=20041222205501273|title= Groklaw.net – The EU Microsoft Decision – December 2004|publisher=|accessdate=13 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and lost the appeal in 2007,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20070917053717322|title= Groklaw.net – EU Ct. of 1st Instance: Microsoft Abused its Dominant Position – Updated – September 2007|publisher=|accessdate=13 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and their further appeal in 2012:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.groklaw.net/articlebasic.php?story=20120627094954981|title=Groklaw.net Microsoft Loses Its EU Appeal |publisher=|accessdate=13 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; being convicted of abusing its dominant position.  Specifically they had withheld inter-operability information with the open source [[Samba (software)]] project, which can be run on many platforms and aims to "removing barriers to interoperability".
In 2008, however, Sam Ramji, the then head of open-source-software strategy in Microsoft, began working closely with Bill Gates to develop a pro-open-source attitude within the software industry as well as Microsoft itself. Ramji, before leaving the company in 2009, built Microsoft's familiarity and involvement with open source, which is evident in Microsoft's contributions of open-source code to Windows Azure, "its new-age web service for building and hosting applications on the net", among other projects. These contributions would have been previously unimaginable by Microsoft.&lt;ref&gt;Metz, Cade. (2012, Jan 30).

'''Ovidiu Coriolan Pecican''' (born  January 8, 1959) is a Romanian historian, essayist, novelist, short-story writer, literary critic, poet, playwright, and journalist of partly Serbian origin. He is especially known for his political writings on disputed issues such as [[regional autonomy]] for [[Transylvania]], and for his co-authorship of a controversial history textbook for 11th and 12th grade high-school students.

Pecican is co-editor of ''Caietele Tranziției'' and a contributor to major newspapers, including ''[[Contemporanul]]'', ''[[Cotidianul]]'', and ''[[Ziarul Financiar]]''. He has also written works of [[science fiction]], mainstream literature and cultural history studies. Since 1994, he has been a member of the [[Romanian Writers' Union]].

==Biography==

===Career===
Born in [[Arad, Romania|Arad]], Pecican graduated from the [[Babeş-Bolyai University|University of Cluj-Napoca]] (currently known as the ''Babeș-Bolyai University'', UBB) in 1985.  He published his first short story in 1978.  During the late 1970s, he was active in the underground movie-making movement in his native city, as a member of the ''Atelier 16'' Club, together with [[Gheorghe Sabău]], [[Mircea Mihăieş]], [[Ioan T. Morar]], Valentin Constantin, [[Alexandru Pecican]] and others. As a student, between 1981 and 1985, he became a member of the staff of the periodicals ''Napoca Universitară'' and ''Echinox''. Regularly featured in various literary magazines, his prose was first edited in a single volume in 1990 (''Eu și maimuța mea'', "Me and My Monkey" &amp;mdash; published by [[Editura Dacia]]).

Between 1985 and 1990, Pecican worked as a high school professor of history in [[Lipova, Arad|Lipova]], [[Arad County]]; in 1991–1994, he was a researcher for the UBB's Center for Transylvanian Studies (''Centrul de Studii Transilvane''), before becoming a [[Lecturer]] at the UBB (1994).  The recipient of a [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] in History and Philosophy (1985) and of a [[PhD]] in [[Middle Ages|Medieval History]] (1998), both from the UBB, he specialized in the [[Social history|social]] and [[cultural history]] of [[Central Europe|Central]] and [[Southeastern Europe]].

In 1994, Pecican published a book of interviews with novelist [[Nicolae Breban]] (''O utopie tangibilă'', "A Tangible Utopia"; [[Editura Didactică şi Pedagogică]]). In 1995, he also authored, together with [[Horaţiu Mihaiu]], the [[experimental theater]] show ''17 acte cu Piet Mondrian'' ("17 Acts with [[Piet Mondrian]]"), which was hosted by the [[National Theater Cluj-Napoca|National Theater]] in [[Cluj-Napoca]], before being showcased at the [[Belgrade Summer Festival]] and winning several Romanian awards.&lt;ref name = "EL"&gt;''E-Leonardo''&lt;/ref&gt; After 1997, books by him were published yearly or in several volumes each year.

Pecican is a Professor (since 2004) and was Chancellor at the Babeș-Bolyai University Faculty of European Studies (1997–1999) and served on the staff of the UBB's "The European Idea" Foundation for European Studies as its first manager (1997–1999). He has been the recipient of [[TEMPUS]] grants from the [[University of Sussex]], [[Utrecht University]], the [[University of Münster]], the [[University of Milan]], and the [[Institut national des langues et civilisations orientales|INALCO]], as well as receiving grants from the [[Central European University]], [[Michigan State University]] and a [[German Academic Exchange Service|DAAD]] grant from the University of Münster.

He is a coordinator of the ''Other Europes'' series for the Foundation's publishing house, [[Editura EFES|EFES]], and, between 2001–2005, he headed another publishing house, founded by the Desire Foundation. He also coordinates the ''Limb'' series for the [[Editura Limes|Limes Publishing House]]. Pecican was also head of the [[History of Romania since 1989|Post-Totalitarian]] Studies, an office he shared with [[Emil Boc]] (who was a lecturer at the time).&lt;ref name = "EL" /&gt; He has edited [[Romanian-language]] versions of, among others, works by [[Geoffroy de Villehardouin]] (''[[Villehardouin's De la Conquête de Constantinople|De la Conquête de Constantinople]]''), [[Robert de Clari]] (''La Conquête de Constantinople''), [[Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu]] (''Olteneștile''), and [[Yves Ternon]] (''[[L'État criminel]]'').

===Sigma textbook===
In late 1999, when the [[Ministry of Education and Research of Romania|Ministry of Education]], led by [[Andrei Marga]] at the time, decided to allow new textbooks to be published as alternatives to the official ones in use, Pecican, together with [[Sorin Mitu]], Lucia Copoeru, Virgiliu Țârău, and Liviu Țîrău, published a version of a 12th grade manual of [[History of Romania|Romanian history]] with [[Editura Sigma]]. The volume was submitted to Ministry approval, and caused a political scandal after its content became known to the public &amp;mdash; its critics argued that it lacked structure and balance, that it discarded traditional [[historiography]] in themes and discourse,&lt;ref name = "Cernat"&gt;Cernat&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Pârâianu"&gt;Pârâianu&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Prăvălia"&gt;''Prăvălia culturală''&lt;/ref&gt; and even that part of the information was purely trivial.&lt;ref name = "Cernat" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Pârâianu" /&gt;  Pecican identified most of these concerns with support for [[Nationalism|nationalist]] tenets, and argued they were unscientific.&lt;ref name = "Prăvălia" /&gt;

The volume was immediately faced with criticism from the ultra-nationalist opposition group [[Greater Romania Party]], through the voice of [[Anghel Stanciu]] (who called the textbook "anti-national").&lt;ref&gt;Stanciu, in Pârâianu&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after, Romania's largest opposition group at the time, the [[Social Democratic Party (Romania)|Social Democratic Party]], joined in the protest, and [[Parliament of Romania|Parliament]]ary groups from outside the governing [[Romanian Democratic Convention]] (CDR) issued a formal protest: their motion was rejected on November 15, but the scandal, deepened by major coverage in the press,&lt;ref name = "Cernat" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Pârâianu" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Prăvălia" /&gt; probably contributed to weakening support for the CDR.&lt;ref name = "Pârâianu" /&gt;

Academia was divided over the issue: while the [[Romanian Academy]] expressed concern that the Sigma textbook was not up to educational standards,&lt;ref name = "Pârâianu" /&gt; several, especially young, historians supported it.&lt;ref name = "Cernat" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Pârâianu" /&gt;  The [[National Liberal Party (Romania)|National Liberal]] politician and historian [[Adrian Cioroianu]], himself the co-author of a new manual and a vocal critic of the methods of Pecican's adversaries during the polemic, publicly sided with the Sigma authors, and argued in their favor during televised confrontations with [[Marius Tucă]] and [[Octavian Paler]].&lt;ref name = "Cernat" /&gt;

Eventually, the original version failed to win Ministry approval. In later editions, the Sigma textbook was published with significant changes in content.&lt;ref name = "Pârâianu" /&gt; In 2002, the PSD Minister [[Ecaterina Andronescu]] removed it from the list of endorsed textbooks, which caused Pecican to issue a formal protest,&lt;ref name = "Prăvălia" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Neumann"&gt;Neumann&lt;/ref&gt; supported by, among others, the historian and [[West University of Timişoara|West University]] professor [[Victor Neumann]].&lt;ref name = "Neumann" /&gt; Both Pecican and Neumann expressed concerns that this was signaling a return to official history, and made mention of inconsistencies in educational policies.&lt;ref name = "Prăvălia" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Neumann" /&gt;

===2001 ''Memorandum''===
With [[Molnar Gusztav]], [[Smaranda Enache]], [[Marius Cotmeanu]], [[Miklós Bakk]] and other [[Romanians|Romanian]] and [[Hungarian minority in Romania|Magyar]] [[intellectual]]s from Transylvania, Pecican founded the ''Provincia Group'' around the magazine ''Provincia'' (April 2000); it was created as an [[advocacy group]] in favor of debating the majority-minority relationship in Romania, dedicated to reshaping Romanian administrative policies and renouncing [[Centralized government|centralism]].&lt;ref name = "Cioroianu"&gt;Cioroianu&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Muntean"&gt;Muntean&lt;/ref&gt;  On December 8, 2001, it issued a ''Memorandum'' calling for a public debate on the issue of Transylvanian autonomy.&lt;ref name = "Prăvălia" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Cioroianu" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Muntean" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Scrisoare"&gt;Pecican, "Scrisoare deschisă…"&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Memorandum'' drew criticism from several sources. In an editorial for ''[[Ziua]]'', Adrian Cioroianu expressed his own support for a degree of [[decentralization]], but argued that the document was unrealistic in its assumptions and more radical goals, and that it did not represent a unitary perspective on the issue.&lt;ref name = "Cioroianu" /&gt; The ''Memorandum'' was dismissed outright by [[President of Romania|President]] [[Ion Iliescu]], a gesture which prompted Pecican to address him in an [[open letter]].&lt;ref name = "Scrisoare" /&gt; The more nationalist political forces called on authorities to indict the document's authors, based on an interpretation of the [[Constitution of Romania]].&lt;ref name = "Prăvălia" /&gt;

===Other polemics===
In late October 2005, the journalist Melania Mandaș Vergu published an article in ''[[Gândul]]'' on the issue of Pecican's alleged candidature for government office in [[List of Prime Ministers of Romania|Prime Minister]] [[Călin Popescu-Tăriceanu]]'s [[Justice and Truth]] cabinet. The article made reference to Pecican's involvement in the textbook scandal (focusing on a reference to "[[Decebalus]]' sensual lips", made in the Sigma volume) and identified Pecican's ideas with those  of [[Sabin Gherman]], the advocate of a high degree of Transylvanian autonomy (it alleged that Pecican shared Gherman's statement "I'm all fed up with Romania!").&lt;ref&gt;Mandaș Vergu&lt;/ref&gt; Replying in ''[[Cotidianul]]'', Pecican dismissed the tone and content of the article as "deliberate manipulation and distortion", while recalling that, during the 1999 polemic, the respective journalist had published what he called "curse words" (''sudălmi'') aimed at Sigma authors.&lt;ref&gt;Pecican, "Abureala"&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2005, Pecican was among the group of intellectuals who reacted to the controversial views held by the exiled writer [[Paul Goma]] on issues involving [[Bessarabia]] and [[Romania during World War II|World War II Romanian history]]. Alongside [[Radu Ioanid]], [[Michael Shafir]], [[Laszlo Alexandru]], [[Andrei Oişteanu]] and others, he accused Goma of [[Antisemitism]] and [[Holocaust denial]], and concluded that his ''Săptămîna Roșie'' volume, reflecting Goma's theory on the [[Soviet occupation of Bessarabia]], was spurious.&lt;ref&gt;Alexandru&lt;/ref&gt;

His polemics include the one against the new treatise on Romanian history, published by the [[Romanian Academy]] beginning 2002. Coordinated by the historians [[Dan Berindei]] and [[Virgil Cândea]], the large collective work was sharply criticized also by [[Şerban Papacostea]], [[Leon Şimanschi]], [[Ştefan Andreescu]] and some other historians for alleged ethical problems, but Pecican accused the synthesis for its perceived nationalist and [[Statism|statist]] views. Later, when one of the authors, [[Mihai Bărbulescu]], reacted against Pecican's arguments, the latter answered and presented new arguments.

==Work==

===Medieval studies and historiography===
Ovidiu Pecican's main contribution to medieval studies addresses the first stages of [[Culture of Romania|Romanian culture]]. Trapped between [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] [[ethos]] and [[Church Slavonic language|Slavonic language]], on one hand, and the [[Western culture|Western]] or [[Latin]] influences, on the other, the old Romanian culture of the 11th-17th centuries faced a large variety of challenges, and showed a remarkable diversity. Pecican uncovered the prehistory of various enigmatic texts, reconstituting both lost texts and contexts, as well as the image of a whole written culture expressing the choices made by medieval Romanians in the [[Balkans]] and the territory between [[Danube]] and the [[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathians]].

''Troia, Veneția, Roma'' (1998) deals with the imagined homelands of the [[Vlachs]] as they result from old written fragments conserved in later contexts, laying out some of the main characteristics of Romanian identity at the time of its first making. The cultural origins of the Romanians' negative self-image, both inherited and developed, is the topic of Pecican's ''Lumea lui Simion Dascălul'' (1998), where he attempts to define the cultural [[elite]]s of Early Modern [[Moldavia]] (17th century) and to determine the reasons why [[Simion Dascălul]], one of the leading Romanian chroniclers of the time, is misunderstood. Pecican's ''Arpadieni, Angevini, români'' (2001) focuses on the Romanian-origin [[Nobility and royalty of the Kingdom of Hungary|lesser nobility]] in the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] under the [[Árpád dynasty|Árpáds]] and the [[Capetian House of Anjou|Angevins]] until the end of the 14th century; the volume contradicts both Romanian and Hungarian historiographic tradition, which have traditionally claimed that Romanians were only [[Serfdom|serfs]] under Hungarian rule or that Romanians were brought from the Balkans and into Transylvania only to guard the Hungarian border. The volume raised debates between the author and historian [[Ioan-Aurel Pop]], who claimed that Pecican's views favored the Hungarians. ''Realități imaginate și ficțiuni adevărate în evul mediu românesc'' (2002) and ''Trecutul istoric si omul evului mediu'' (2002) center on newly discovered medieval historical writings from Transylvania, [[Wallachia]] and Moldavia. They include annals from the times of [[List of rulers of Wallachia|Wallachian Prince]] [[Vlad III the Impaler]], as well as from previous and subsequent periods, which, Pecican indicates, show the vitality of a culture in its development and the dialog with the neighboring cultures.

The debate on regionalism prompted Ovidiu Pecican to write a new book on the regional political forms before and after the founding of the [[Danubian Principalities]], under the title of ''Originile istorice ale regionalismului românesc'' (2003). The historian argues against the [[Essentialism|essentialist]] image of the [[nation-state]], and points to a rich originality of political forms, autonomy experiments on the lower Danube and in the Carpathians, foreign influences and original answers.

Some of the other volumes written by Pecican also reflect his questioning of official versions provided for the past.  ''Sânge și trandafiri. Cultura ero(t)ică in Moldova lui Ștefan cel Mare'' (2005) attempts to provide the reader with a different image of the national hero [[Stephen III of Moldavia|Stephen the Great]], [[List of rulers of Moldavia|Prince of Moldavia]] (1457–1504), who was sanctified by the [[Romanian Orthodox Church]]. The volume focuses on [[Eros|erotic]] and heroic mixture of instinct and behavior at Stephen's court, as it appears to have been reflected in literature and arts of his time. In ''Între cruciați și tătari'' (2006), the attempt is to understand the challenges confronting [[History of Romania since 1989|post-1989 Romania]] and its longing for integration into [[NATO]] and the [[European Union]], by comparing them with the years between the [[Fourth Crusade]] (1204) and the [[Mongol invasion of Europe|Mongol Invasion]] (1241–1243), when the Western world extended itself down to the Carpathians.

Pecican is also interested in how Eastern European culture developed in contact with the Western culture during the 19th and 20th centuries. ''Hașdeenii. O odisee a receptării'' (2003) and ''B. P. Hasdeu istoric'' (2004), books developed from his PhD thesis, attempt to explain how, through the efforts of several leading intellectuals during the second part of the 19th century, modern nationalism, together with [[liberalism]], formed a nationalist identity. ''Poarta leilor. Istoriografia tânară din Transilvania'' (Vol.I: 2005; Vol.II: 2006) is a synthesis concerning the young historiography from Transylvania after the [[Romanian Revolution of 1989]], investigating its attraction to the Western model and its polemic with the nationalist-[[Communism|communist]] autochthonous model as developed by the [[Communist Romania|Communist regime]].

===Novels===
Pecican's first novel, ''Eu și maimuța mea'', written in 1994, speaks about love in a psychiatric hospital in the times of [[Nicolae Ceauşescu]]'s dictatorship. The modular formula of the narrative contributes to creating a lyric atmosphere, underlying the contrast between the purity of the love story, on one hand, and the dark context, on the other.

Later in the same year, Ovidiu Pecican and his cousin, Alexandru Pecican, completed work on a second novel, ''Razzar'', a mythical and [[Archetype|archetypal]] [[metaphor]] of the human destiny elaborated within the literary conventions of the science fiction genre. ''Razzar'' received the [[Editura Nemira|Nemira Publishing House]] Prize for novels in 1998.

Nine years later, Pecican published a third novel, ''Imberia'', which depicts the daily dilemmas a young intellectual has to face in post-communist Romania during the transition period (including sexual alienation and the trauma of his father's death).

The '''Pijao'''  (also '''Piajao''', '''Pixao''', '''Pinao''') are an indigenous people of [[Colombia]].

== Ethnography ==
The Pijao or Pijaos formed a loose federation of [[Amerindians]] and were living in the present-day department of [[Tolima Department|Tolima]], Colombia. In pre-Columbian times, they inhabited the [[Cordillera Central (Colombia)|Central Ranges]] of the Colombian [[Andes]]; between the snowy mountains of [[Huila Department|Huila]], Tolima and [[Quindío Department|Quindío]], the upper valley of the [[Magdalena River]] and the upper [[Valle del Cauca Department|Valle del Cauca]] in Colombia. They did not have a strict hierarchy and did not create an empire.

The chiefdom was based on an extended family clan with ancestral lineage. The people did not live in separate households gathered in villages; instead, they lived in carefully built large communal houses made of ''[[bahareque]]'', which were placed at distances.

They used bonfires to communicate with smoke signs, and these were used to convene different community events. Like many ancient peoples, they relied on waterways for routes of transportation; and due to their navigation skills and knowledge, could get around much of their territory fairly rapidly.  They called their best navigators boha (boga).  Their boats were called ''kanoha'' ([[canoes]]), and were carved from a single piece of Saman wood.

The Pijao were experts in metallurgy, manufacturing gold articles and clothing. Their work has been seen in gold artifacts from the Tolima, [[Quimbaya culture|Quimbaya]], [[Calima culture|Calima]], and [[Cauca culture]]s. They used techniques such as "lost wax" casting, [[rolled gold]], [[filigree]] and other methods to make their ''balacas'' (ornaments) and other items for ceremonial use, such as the  ''[[poporo]]s'' (bowl with lid).

Like some other ancient cultures, the Pijao practiced skull modification and facial alterations, as well as a variety of body modifications, perhaps to identify or distinguish elites. They tied slats on male babies' heads to alter their frontal and occipital regions, perhaps to give them a look of ferocity. They also modified the shape of their upper and lower extremities using adjusted ropes (Interlaced fiber ropes).  They changed the appearance of the nose by fracturing the nasal septum.  They pierced the nose and the ear lobes to wear gold ornaments and decorations symbolic of their religion.  They called these body ornaments ''Wua-La-ka'' (''Balak'').  The crowns of the elite were made of several precious materials; in addition, they wore ceremonial masks, feather crowns, bracelets, nose ornaments and other items.

They painted their bodies for communal events with a red color powder known as ''achiote'' (''Bi-Cha'' or ''Bija''). [9] Their assemblies, also known as ''Mingas'', were held under the broad shade of the [[Ceiba]] trees.  The Ceiba was considered a symbol of the Great Home of a rich, generous and motherly nature.  Here they carried out war ceremonies, crowning of chiefs, wedding rituals and other major events.  Most were accompanied by dancing to the beat of ''[[maracas]]'', ''[[fotuto]]'', ''yaporojas'' and drums. Young single women (virgins) were decorated with flowers.

Agriculturalists, the Pijao lived close to the earth in homes made of wood and rammed earth. Due to the tropical climate and excellent soil in the highlands, they were able to grow, harvest and cultivate many crops including potatoes, [[yucca]], [[maize]], [[mango]]es, [[papaya]]s, [[guava]]s and many other fruits and vegetables. They also fished and hunted for meats.

They wore, as a custom dress, beautifully decorated golden clothes which did not cover their genitals.  They painted their bodies with dyed tops of ''bija''.  The Spanish conquerors initially called them ''Bipxaus'' (''Bija''), the same name as one of the Paece [[chiefdoms]].  Later they referred to the people as the Pijao, which came to be considered a pejorative.

The Pijao practiced ritual [[cannibalism]] of their enemies. The Spanish captain Diego de Bocanegra (one of many military leaders who battled against the Pijao) accused them of having cannibalized up to 100,000 Spaniards in approximately 50 years.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

Despite regularly driving back the invading Spaniards, the Pijao population kept decreasing and they were pushed further south in the highlands.  They began to clash with neighboring tribes such as the [[Coconuco]], [[Paez people|Páez]], [[Puruhá]], and [[Cana]]. By the mid-18th century, the Pijao people had suffered drastic losses, mostly due to new [[infectious diseases]], to which they had no immunity. [[Missionary]] [[Christians]] had also taken a toll through conversion and re-education of many natives.

The Spanish followed their invasions with colonization of most of the central highlands and the Andes mountain ranges.  Through these measures they established the New Kingdom of Granada.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4754">'''Press support''' is a government [[subsidy]] available for [[newspaper]]s in some countries. The support can either be direct, in terms of money to the newspaper, or indirect, such as lowered or eliminated [[sales tax]]. The justification for press support is typically to maintain some level of diversity in the media market.

== Press support by country ==
=== Norway ===
Press support is a [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[subsidy|state subsidy]] available for [[newspaper]]s.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}} The subsidy is twofold; the first part is a direct subsidy of the second- largest, by circulation, newspapers in each city. The other subsidy is that newspaper are subject to no [[sales tax]] (as are [[book]]s).
====Direct support====
The direct subsidy is managed by the [[Norwegian Media Authority]], and was [[Norwegian krone|NOK]] 303 million in 2006, paid to 138 newspapers. It was introduced in 1965, because of the fear of a massive newspaper death like [[Sweden]] and [[Denmark]] had seen, mainly the second largest newspapers in each city. Also, at the time, most newspapers were not [[political neutrality|political neutral]], with many papers being controlled by either [[conservativism|conservative forces]], the [[Norwegian Confederation of Trade Unions|labour movement]] or [[List of political parties in Norway|political parties]]. Support is given to all newspapers that are do not have the largest circulation in the city of publishing. There are limitations on the newspapers who can receive support, including that the support will cease if they pay a [[dividend]] to their owners. Other support is given to [[media studies|media research]], follow-up studies, [[sami people|sami newspapers]], immigrant publications and distribution support for [[Finnmark]].

The press support has been partially successful, with a number of second-largest newspapers surviving, like ''[[Bergensavisen]]'' (Bergen), ''[[Rogalands Avis]]'' (Stavanger) and ''[[Dagsavisen]]'' (Oslo). Other secondary newspapers have been closed, like ''[[Trondheims-Pressen]]''. The largest receivers are often national newspapers, targeting special (often political) sectors, like ''[[Klassekampen]]'' (Socialist), ''[[Nationen]]'' (Agrarian) and ''[[Vårt Land (Norwegian newspaper)|Vårt Land]]'' (Christian). Most of the large, [[business newspaper|business]] and [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] newspapers, like [[Dagbladet]] or [[Dagens Næringsliv]], do not receive support, since they pay dividend to their owners.

|}

====Indirect support====
By far the greatest level of support to newspapers arises out of their exemption from sales tax and exceeds NOK 1 billion. This exemption was instituted to foster a variety of perspectives from newspapers; to stimulate public debate and consciousness, [[democracy]], [[freedom of speech]] and to enable the media to act as society's watch-dog.

'''Proto-Samoyedic''', or '''Proto-Samoyed''', is the [[linguistic reconstruction|reconstructed]] ancestral language of the [[Samoyedic languages]]: [[Nenets languages|Nenets]] ([[Tundra Nenets language|Tundra]] and [[Forest Nenets language|Forest]]), [[Enets language|Enets]], [[Nganasan language|Nganasan]], [[Selkup language|Selkup]], as well as extinct [[Kamassian language|Kamas]] and [[Mator language|Mator]]. Samoyedic is one of the principal branches of the [[Uralic languages|Uralic language family]], and its ancestor is [[Proto-Uralic]].

== Phonology ==

A fairly complex system of vowel phonemes is reconstructed for Proto-Samoyedic:

{| class="wikitable IPA"
|-
|
! colspan=2 | [[front vowel|Front]]
! colspan=2 | [[back vowel|Back]]
|-
|
![[unrounded vowel|Unrounded]]
![[rounded vowel|Rounded]]
![[unrounded vowel|Unrounded]]
![[rounded vowel|Rounded]]
|-
![[close vowel|Close]]
| align="center" |''i'' [i]
| align="center" |''ü'' [y]
| align="center" |''ï'' [ɯ]
| align="center" |''u'' [u]
|-
![[mid vowel|Mid]]
| align="center" |''e'' [e]
| align="center" |''ö'' [ø]
| align="center" |''ë'' [ɤ]
| align="center" |''o'' [o]
|-
![[open vowel|Open]]
| align="center" |''ä'' [æ]
| align="center" |
| align="center" |''a'' [ɑ]
| align="center" |''å'' [ɒ]
|-
![[reduced vowel|Reduced]]
| colspan=2 align="center" | ''ə̈'' [ə̟] || colspan=2 align="center" | ''ə'' [ə̠]
|}
The system is retained relatively faithfully in [[Selkup language|Selkup]] (though expanded with [[vowel length]]). Two of the vowel contrasts are however only retained in [[Nganasan language|Nganasan]]: the distinction of front and back reduced vowels, and that of *i versus *e. For the remainder of the family, following the mergers *e &gt; *i and *ə̈ &gt; *ə, a further shared change is raising of *ä &gt; *e.&lt;ref&gt;Helimski, Eugen: [http://helimski.com/2.222.doc, The 13th Proto-Samoyedic vowel] {{Dead link|fix-attempted=yes|date=September 2018}}.
- In: Mikola-konferencia 2004. Szeged: SzTE Department of Finnougristics, 2005. 27-39.&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier works often thus give a slightly different transcription of several vowels:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Ante|last=Aikio|title=New and Old Samoyed Etymologies (Part 2)|journal=Finnish-Ugrische Forschungen|issue=59|p=10|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Older reconstruction !! Current reconstruction
|-
| *i || *i, *e
|-
| *e || *ä
|-
| *ä || *a
|}

Even though the number of vowel phonemes was high, there were no long vowels or phonemic diphthongs. A peculiar feature of the reconstructed vowel system is the occurrence of vowel sequences, which consisted of any full vowel followed by the reduced vowel /ə/: for example, *''tuə'' 'feather', *''kåəså'' 'man'. These sequences were not diphthongs; the vowels belonged to separate syllables. Evidence of the vowel sequences has been preserved in only part of the Samoyedic languages, primarily in Nganasan and [[Enets language|Enets]]. Wagner-Nagy (2004)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Beáta|last=Wagner-Nagy|title=Wort- und Silbenstruktur im Protosamojedischen|journal=Finnisch-Ugrische Mitteilungen|pp=87–108|issue=26–27|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; lists the following examples:
* Close + reduced: *iə, *iə̈, *üə, *üə̈, *uə, *uə̈
* Mid + reduced: *öə, *ëə, *oə, *oə̈
* Open + reduced: *äə (&gt; *eə), *åə
* Close + open: *uå
* Reduced + open: *əå

Proto-Samoyedic had [[vowel harmony]] like many other Uralic languages. Harmony determined whether a front vocalic or a back vocalic [[allomorph]] of a [[suffix]] was used. However, the restrictions imposed by vowel harmony were not absolute because also disharmonic word-stems can be reconstructed. Such stems break vowel harmony by combining front and back vowels: e.g. Proto-Samoyedic *''kålä'' 'fish', *''wäsa'' 'iron'.

In contrast to the vowel system, the consonant system is rather simple with only 13 phonemes:

{| class="wikitable"

![[Palatal consonant|palatal]]

|-

|-

| align="center" |
|-
![[semivowel]]
| align="center" |w
| align="center" |
| align="center" |j
| align="center" |
|-
|}

The exact sound value of the affricate is not entirely clear; it may originally have been [[Retroflex consonant|retroflex]] {{IPA|[ʈ͡ʂ]}} rather than dental or alveolar {{IPA|[t͡s]}}. It has remained distinct only in Selkup, merging elsewhere with *''t''.

As in [[Proto-Uralic]], the ancestor of Proto-Samoyedic, the first syllable of words was always stressed, and hence there was no contrastive [[Stress (linguistics)|stress]]. Contrastive [[Tone (linguistics)|tones]] did not occur either.

===Phonotactics===
As in Proto-Uralic, words could begin with a maximum of one consonant: initial [[consonant cluster]]s were not allowed. Another [[phonotactic]] constraint inherited from Proto-Uralic was that the consonants *''r'' and *''ŋ'' were not allowed word-initially. Proto-Samoyedic had, however, innovated final consonant clusters in a few words. In all of them, the first consonant in the cluster was the semivowel *''j'', as in *''wajŋ'' 'breath'. Thus, the [[syllable structure]] of Proto-Samoyedic was altogether (C)V(j)(C).

Inside words, clusters of two consonants were common. Clusters of three consonants were again possible only if the first consonant of the cluster was *''j'', as in *''wajkkə'' 'neck'.

=== Later development ===

[[Palatalization (sound change)|Palatalization]] of consonants, most prominently *''k'', has occurred in all recorded Samoyedic languages. This is however a post-Proto-Samoyedic development, as the details differ in each branch due to vowel developments.&lt;ref name = "HPUL"&gt;{{citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Nenets-Enets group palatalizes both *''k'' and *''s'' to /sʲ/.
* Nganasan, Selkup and Kamassian palatalize *''k'' to a distinct /ʃ/. Nganasan also palatalizes *''s'' to /sʲ/.
* Mator appears to have no palatalization of *''k''; however, *''s'' is, somewhat counterintuitively, palatalized to /k/.
* Nenets-Enets and Nganasan have prominent palatalization of other consonants as well, leading to contraction of the vowel system.

Other widespread developments include [[Prosthesis (linguistics)|prothesis]] of *''ŋ'', initial lenition of *''p'', and [[fortition]] of the semivowels *''w'', *''j''.
* In Nganasan, Nenets and Enets, PS vowel-initial words gain an initial /ŋ/ (which may be subsequently palatalized to /nʲ/).
* PS initial *''p'' is lenited to /f/ in Enets, /h/ in Mator and Nganasan. (/f/ still appears in the oldest Nganasan records.)
* PS initial *''w'' remains only in Nenets. In Selkup, it becomes /kʷ/; all other varieties shift it to /b/.
* PS initial *''j'' remains in both Nenets and Enets. It becomes /tʲ/ in Selkup, and /dʲ/ in other varieties.
* In Mator and Kamassian, /b/, /dʲ/ are furthermore nasalized to /m/, /nʲ/ preceding a word-internal nasal. This has been an [[Language area|areal]] change, shared also with [[Siberian Turkic]] languages such as [[Khakas language|Khakas]].&lt;ref name=EH03&gt;{{cite journal|first=Eugene|last=Helimski|title=Areal groupings (Sprachbünde) within and across the borders of the Uralic language family: A survey|year=2003|journal=Nyelvtudományi Közlemények|ISSN=0029-6791|url=http://www.nytud.hu/nyk/100/helimski.pdf|accessdate=2014-10-31|p=158}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Morphology ==

Proto-Samoyedic was a fairly typical [[agglutinative language]] with only little [[morphophonology|morphophonological]] alteration, apart from vowel harmony. In the following, ''-A'' marks an [[archiphoneme]] realized as ''-å'' in words with back-vocalic harmony, ''-ä'' in words with front-vocalic harmony.

Three [[grammatical number|numbers]] were distinguished: singular, [[dual grammatical number|dual]] and [[plural]]. Possession was indicated with [[possessive suffix]]es.

Nouns distinguished seven cases:
*[[nominative case|Nominative]]: (no ending)
*[[genitive case|Genitive]]: *-n
*[[accusative case|Accusative]]: *-m
*[[locative case|Locative]]: *-kə-nA
*[[ablative case|Ablative]]: *-kə-t(ə)
*[[dative case|Dative]]: *-kə-
*[[Prosecutive case|Prosecutive]]: *-mə-nA

Verbs were conjugated for [[grammatical mood|mood]], [[grammatical tense|tense]], [[grammatical number|number]] and [[grammatical person|person]]. There were also separate subjective and objective [[grammatical conjugation|conjugations]].

[[Morphological derivation|Derivational]] suffixes were numerous, and could form both verbs and nominals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Tamás|last=Janurik|year=2010|title=A közszamojéd szóanyag rekonstruálható képzői|journal=Folia Uralica Debreceniensia|volume=17|url=http://mnytud.arts.unideb.hu/finnugor/fud/fud17.pdf|accessdate=2015-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development ==
Most Proto-Samoyedic phonemes continue the corresponding Proto-Uralic phonemes unchanged. The most prominent changes are:&lt;ref name = "HPUL"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

* PU *''u'' &gt; PS *''ø'' preceding a PU stem vowel *''a''.
* PU *''ï'' &gt; PS *''ë'' in PS closed syllables.
* PU *''ü'' &gt; PS *''i''. PS *''ü'' is of secondary origin.
* PU stem-final *''i'' is reduced to PS *''ø̈''/''ø'' (per harmony), and if not preceded by an original consonant cluster, subsequently lost.
* PU *''a, o'' generally become PS *''å'', though in many cases PS *''a'' also appears; the conditioning for this is not entirely clear.
* PU stem-final *''å'' becomes PS *''ä'' after a lateral consonant (PU *''l'' or *''δ́''; this points to an intermediate stage *''ĺ'' in the development of the latter.)
* PU *''o'' remains in monosyllabic roots (both primary, and those resulting from loss of final *''ø'').
* PU *''k'', *''x'', *''w'', *''j'' are lost between vowels in roots of the shape *CVCi, yielding monosyllabic PS roots.
* PU *''k'' and preconsonantal *''w'' are generally lost in medial consonant clusters.
Examples:
* PU *äjmä "needle" &gt; PS *äjmä
* PU *kala "fish" &gt; PS *kålä
* PU *muna "egg" &gt; PS *mønå
* PU *weti "water" &gt; PS *wet
* PU *nüδi "handle" &gt; PS *nir
* PU *ïpti "hair" &gt; PS *ëptø

'''Public awareness of science''' ('''PAwS'''), '''public understanding of science''' ('''PUS'''), or more recently, '''Public Engagement with Science and Technology''' ('''PEST''') are terms relating to the attitudes, behaviours, opinions, and activities that comprise the relations between the general public or lay society as a whole to scientific knowledge and organisation. It is a comparatively new approach to the task of exploring the multitude of relations and linkages [[science]], [[technology]], and [[innovation]] have among the general public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Savaget|first1=Paulo|last2=Acero|first2=Liliana|title=Plurality in understandings of innovation, sociotechnical progress and sustainable development: An analysis of OECD expert narratives|journal=Public Understanding of Science|year=2017|doi=10.1177/0963662517695056}}&lt;/ref&gt; While earlier work in the discipline had focused on augmenting public knowledge of scientific topics, in line with the [[information deficit model]] of [[science communication]], the discrediting of the model has led to an increased emphasis on how the public [[uses and gratifications theory|chooses to use]] scientific knowledge and on the development of interfaces to mediate between [[expertise|expert]] and [[layperson|lay]] understandings of an issue.{{examples|date=October 2015}}

== Major themes ==
The area integrates a series of fields and themes such as:
* [[Science communication]] in the [[mass media]], [[Internet]], [[radio]] and [[television]] programmes
* [[Science museums]], [[aquarium|aquaria]], [[planetarium|planetaria]], [[zoo|zoological parks]], [[botanical garden]]s, etc.
* Public controversies over science and technology
* Fixed and mobile science exhibits
* [[Science festival]]s
* [[Science fair]]s in schools and social groups
* [[Science education]] for adults
* Science and [[social movement]]s
* Media and science ([[Mediatization (media)|medialisation]] of science)
* [[Consumer education]]
* [[Citizen science]]
* Public tours of [[research and development]] (R&amp;D) parks, manufacturing companies, etc.
* [[Science in popular culture]]
* Science in text books and classrooms
* Science and art

How to raise public awareness and public understanding of science and technology, and how the public feels and knows about science in general, and specific subjects, such as [[genetic engineering]], [[bioethics]], etc., are important lines of research in this area. Professor of communication, Matthew Nisbet, points up the challenge, for example, in terms of the paradox of the success of science and engineering creating the conditions that have led to the trust or distrust of experts among certain populations and that the correlation appears to be more socioeconomic than religious or ideological.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Nisbet |first1=Matthew |title=Divided Expectations: Why We Need a New Dialogue about Science, Inequality, and Society |journal=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] |date=2018 |volume=42 |issue=1 |pages=18-19 |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180619185052/https://www.csicop.org/si/show/divided_expectations |accessdate=19 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The publication of the [[Royal Society|Royal Society's]]' report ''The Public Understanding of Science&lt;ref name=RS-Bodmer-report&gt;{{cite web|last1=The Royal Society|title=The Public Understanding of Science|url=https://royalsociety.org/topics-policy/publications/1985/public-understanding-science/|publisher=The Royal Society|accessdate=11 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;'' (or ''Bodmer Report'') in 1985 is widely held to be the birth of the Public Understanding of Science movement in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/doc_WTD004707.html{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The report led to the foundation of the [[Committee on the Public Understanding of Science]] and a cultural change in the attitude of scientists to outreach activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldselect/ldsctech/38/3805.htm#n26|title=House of Lords - Science and Technology - Third Report|work=parliament.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The contextualist model ==
In the 1990s, a new perspective emerged in the field with the classic study of [[Cumbria]]n Sheep Farmers' interaction with the Nuclear scientists in [[England]], where [[Brian Wynne]] demonstrated how the experts were ignorant or disinterested in taking into account the lay knowledge of the sheep farmers while conducting field experiments on the impact of the [[Chernobyl]] Nuclear fall out on the sheep in the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Wynne|first=Brian|date=1996|chapter=Misunderstood Misunderstandings: Social Identities and the Public Uptake of Science|url=|editors=Alan Irwin and Brian Wynne |title=Misunderstanding Science? The Public Reconstruction of Science and Technology |location=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press |pages=19–46|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this shortcoming from the side of the scientists, local farmers lost their trust in them. The experts were unaware of the local environmental conditions and the behaviour of sheep and this has eventually led to the failure of their experimental models. Following this study, scholars have studies similar micro-sociological contexts of expert-lay interaction and proposed that the context of knowledge communication is important to understand public engagement with science. Instead of large scale public opinion surveys, researchers proposed studies informed by [[Sociology of scientific knowledge|Sociology of Scientific Knowledge (SSK)]]. The contextualist model focuses on the social impediments in the  bidirectional flow of scientific knowledge between experts and laypersons/communities.

== The deliberative turn ==
The scholarly debate on public engagement with science developed further into analyzing the deliberations on science  through various institutional forms, with the help of the theory of deliberative democracy. Public deliberation of and participation in science practiced through public spheres became a major emphasis. Scholars like [[Sheila Jasanoff]] argues for wider public deliberation on science in democratic societies which is a basic condition for decision making regarding science and technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jasanoff|first=Sheila|date=2003|title=Breaking the Waves in Science Studies: Comment on H.M. Collins and Robert Evans, 'The Third Wave of Science Studies'|url=|journal=Social Studies of Science |volume=33 |issue=3 |pages=389–400|doi=10.1177/03063127030333004|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also attempts to develop more inclusive participatory models of technological governance in the form of consensus conferences, citizen juries, extended peer reviews, and deliberative mapping.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lövbrand, Eva, Roger Pielke, Jr. and Silke Beck|first=|date=2011|title=A Democracy Paradox in Studies of Science and Technology|url=|journal=Science, Technology and Human Values |volume=36 |issue=4 |pages=474–496|doi=10.1177/0162243910366154|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Measuring public understanding of science ==
Social scientists use various metrics to measure public understanding of science, including:

=== 1. Factual knowledge ===
==== Examples of measurement: ====
* Recognition: Answering a specific question by selecting the correct answer out a list&lt;ref name="Eveland"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Eveland|first1=William|title=How Web Site Organization Influences Free Recall, Factual Knowledge, and Knowledge Structure Density|journal=Human Communications Research|volume=30|issue=2|pages=208–233|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2958.2004.tb00731.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Recall (memory)#Types|Cued Recall]]: Answering a specific question without a list of choices &lt;ref name="Eveland" /&gt;
*[[Recall (memory)#Types|Free Recall]]: After exposure to information, the study participant produces a list of as much of the information as they can remember &lt;ref name="Eveland" /&gt;
==== Key assumptions: ==== 
* The more individual pieces of information a person is able to retrieve, the more that person is considered to have learned &lt;ref name="Eveland" /&gt;

=== 2. Self-reported knowledge, perceived knowledge, or perceived familiarity ===
==== Examples of measurement: ====
* Scaled survey responses to questions such as "How well informed you would say you are about this topic?"&lt;ref name ="Ladwig"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ladwig|first1=Peter|title=Perceived familiarity or factual knowledge? Comparing operationalizations of scientific understanding|journal=Science and Public Policy|volume=39|pages=761–774|doi=10.1093/scipol/scs048}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==== Key assumptions: ==== 
* Emphasizes the value of knowledge of one’s knowledge &lt;ref name="Ladwig" /&gt;

=== 3. Structural knowledge: ===
The nature of connections among different pieces of information in memory &lt;ref name="Eveland" /&gt;
==== Examples of measurement: ====
* Asking study participants to assess relationships among concepts. For example, participants free recall concepts onto the first row and column of a matrix, then indicate whether the concepts are related to each other by placing an “X” in the cell if they are not. Participants then rank the remaining open cells by their relatedness from 1 (only very weakly) to 7 (very strongly related) &lt;ref name="Eveland" /&gt;
* Study participants answer questions designed to measure elaboration involved in a task, such as “I tried to relate the ideas I read about to my own past experiences” &lt;ref name="Eveland" /&gt;
==== Key Assumptions: ====
* The use of [[Elaborative interrogation|elaboration]] increases the likelihood of remembering information &lt;ref name="Eveland" /&gt;

=== Mixed use of the three measures ===
* While some studies purport that factual and perceived knowledge can be viewed as the same construct, a 2012 study investigating public knowledge of nanotechnology supports separating their use in communications research, as they “do not reflect the same underlying knowledge structures." &lt;ref name="Ladwig" /&gt; Correlations between them were found to be low, and they were not predicted by the same factors. For example different types of science media use (television versus online) predicted different constructs &lt;ref name="Ladwig" /&gt;
* Factual knowledge has been shown to be empirically distinct from structural knowledge &lt;ref name="Eveland" /&gt;

== Project examples ==
Government and private-led campaigns and events, such as [[Dana Foundation]]'s "[[Brain Awareness Week]]," are becoming a strong focus of programmes which try to promote public awareness of science.

The UK PAWS Foundation dramatically went as far as establishing a Drama Fund with the BBC in 1994. The purpose was to encourage and support the creation of new drama for television, drawing on the world of science and technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=PAWS off science?|journal=Physics Education|date=January 1998|volume=33|issue=1|doi=10.1088/0031-9120/33/1/011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Vega Science Trust&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vega.org.uk|title=The Vega Science Trust - Science Video - Homepage|work=vega.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; was set up in 1994 to promote science through the media of television and the internet with the aim of giving scientists a platform from which to communicate to the general public.

The [[Simonyi Professorship for the Public Understanding of Science]] chair at [[The University of Oxford]] was established in 1995 for the [[Ethology|ethologist]] [[Richard Dawkins]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.simonyi.ox.ac.uk/previous-holders-simonyi-professorship/professor-richard-dawkins|title=Professor Richard Dawkins - The Simonyi Professorship|work=ox.ac.uk|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514025233/http://www.simonyi.ox.ac.uk/previous-holders-simonyi-professorship/professor-richard-dawkins|archivedate=2011-05-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; by an endowment from [[Charles Simonyi]]. Mathematician [[Marcus du Sautoy]] has held the chair since Dawkins' retirement in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.simonyi.ox.ac.uk/professor-marcus-du-sautoy|title=Professor Marcus du Sautoy - The Simonyi Professorship|work=ox.ac.uk|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100531181656/http://www.simonyi.ox.ac.uk/professor-marcus-du-sautoy|archivedate=2010-05-31|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar professorships have since been created at other British universities. Professorships in the field have been held by well-known academics including [[Richard Fortey]] and [[Kathy Sykes]] at the [[University of Bristol]], [[Brian Cox (physicist)|Brian Cox]] at [[Manchester University]], [[Tanya Byron]] at [[Edge Hill University]], [[Jim Al-Khalili]] at the [[University of Surrey]] and [[Alice Roberts]] at the [[University of Birmingham]].

'''Rhodesiana''' is any [[cultural artifacts|artifact]], or collection of artifacts, which is related to the history, geography, folklore and cultural heritage of [[Rhodesia]], the name used before 1980 to refer to modern Zimbabwe (and, [[Rhodesia (name)|before 1964]], contemporary Zambia as well). Many objects, both physical and immaterial, can be defined as "Rhodesiana"; a painting of a Rhodesian landscape, for example, could be considered as such, as might a song by a Rhodesian artist, or a tale or personality from the country's history.&lt;ref name=rw&gt;{{cite web

[[File:Bas relief from Arch of Marcus Aurelius triumph chariot.jpg|thumb|Panel from a representation of a triumph of the Emperor [[Marcus Aurelius]]; a winged ''[[Genius (mythology)|genius]]'' hovers above his head]]
[[File:Triumph3-Mantegna-bearers-of-trophies-and-bullion.jpg|thumb|Scene from the [[Triumphs of Caesar (Mantegna)|''Triumphs of Caesar'']] by [[Andrea Mantegna]] (1482-94, now [[Royal Collection]])]]
The '''Roman triumph''' (''{{lang|la|[[:wikt:triumphus|triumphus]]}}'') was a [[civil religion|civil ceremony]] and [[Religion in ancient Rome|religious rite]] of [[ancient Rome]], held to publicly celebrate and sanctify the success of a military commander who had led Roman forces to victory in the service of the state or, originally and traditionally, one who had successfully completed a foreign war.

On the day of his triumph, the general wore a crown of laurel and the all-purple, gold-embroidered triumphal [[toga picta]] ("painted" toga), regalia that identified him as near-divine or near-kingly, and even was known to paint his face red. He rode in a four-horse chariot through the streets of Rome in unarmed procession with his army, captives, and the spoils of his war. At [[Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus|Jupiter's temple]] on the [[Capitoline Hill]], he offered sacrifice and the tokens of his victory to the god. Republican [[Mos maiorum|morality]] required that, despite these extraordinary honours, the general conduct himself with dignified humility, as a mortal [[Roman citizenship|citizen]] who triumphed on behalf of Rome's Senate, people, and gods. Inevitably, the triumph offered extraordinary opportunities for self-publicity, besides its religious and military dimensions. 

Most [[Roman festivals]] were calendar fixtures, while the tradition and law which reserved a triumph to extraordinary victory ensured that its celebration, procession, attendant feasting, and public games promoted the general's status and achievement. By the [[Roman Republic#Late Republic.28147.E2.80.9330 BC.29|Late Republican]] era, triumphs were drawn out and extravagant, motivated by increasing competition among the military-political adventurers who ran Rome's nascent empire, in some cases prolonged by several days of public games and entertainments.&lt;!---This sentence originally was incomplete, lacking complete predicate. I have attempted to make sense of it; if it needs editing, PLEASE do not simply revert---&gt; From the [[Principate]] onwards, the triumph reflected the Imperial order and the pre-eminence of the Imperial family.

The triumph was consciously imitated by medieval and later states in the [[royal entry]] and other ceremonial events.

==Background and ceremonies==

===The ''vir triumphalis''===
In Republican Rome, truly exceptional military achievement merited the highest possible honours, which connected the ''vir triumphalis'' ("man of triumph", later known as a ''triumphator'') to Rome's mythical and semi-mythical past. In effect, the general was close to being "king for a day", and possibly close to divinity. He wore the regalia traditionally associated both with the ancient [[Roman monarchy]] and with the statue of ''Jupiter Capitolinus'': the purple and gold "toga picta", laurel crown, red boots and, again possibly, the red-painted face of Rome's supreme deity. He was drawn in procession through the city in a four-horse chariot, under the gaze of his peers and an applauding crowd, to the [[Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus|temple of Capitoline Jupiter]]. The spoils and captives of his victory led the way; his armies followed behind. Once at the Capitoline temple, he sacrificed two white oxen to [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] and laid tokens of his victory at Jupiter's feet,&lt;!---NOTE: it is not clear whose feet are referred to here; I'm guessing that they were Jupiter's vs. the conqueror's---&gt; dedicating his victory to the Roman Senate, people, and gods.&lt;ref&gt;A summary of disparate viewpoints regarding the Triumph are in Versnel, 56–93: limited preview via [https://books.google.com/books?id=DswUAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA57&amp;dq=%22Within+the+range+of+opinions%22+inauthor:Versnel&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;as_brr=0#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Within%20the%20range%20of%20opinions%22%20inauthor%3AVersnel&amp;f=false Books.Google.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

Triumphs were tied to no particular day, season, or religious festival of the [[Roman calendar]]. Most seem to have been celebrated at the earliest practicable opportunity, probably on days that were deemed auspicious for the occasion. Tradition required that, for the duration of a triumph, every temple was open. The ceremony was thus, in some sense, shared by the whole community of Roman gods,&lt;ref&gt;Versnel, p. 386.&lt;/ref&gt; but overlaps were inevitable with specific festivals and anniversaries. Some may have been coincidental; others were designed. For example, March 1, the festival and [[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#dies natalis|''dies natalis'']] of the war god [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]], was the traditional anniversary of the first triumph by [[Publius Valerius Publicola|Publicola]] (504 BCE), of six other Republican triumphs, and of the very first Roman triumph by [[Romulus]].&lt;ref&gt;Beard, p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pompey]] postponed his third and most magnificent triumph for several months to make it coincide with his own ''dies natalis'' (birthday).&lt;ref&gt;Beard, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Denis Feeney, ''Caesar's Calendar: Ancient Time and the Beginnings of History'', University of California Press (2008) p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt;

Religious dimensions aside, the focus of the triumph was the general himself. The ceremony promoted him – however temporarily – above every mortal Roman. This was an opportunity granted to very few. From the time of [[Scipio Africanus]], the triumphal general was linked (at least for historians during the Principate) to [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]] and the demi-god [[Hercules]], who had laboured selflessly for the benefit of all mankind.&lt;ref&gt;Beard, 72-5. See also Diodorus, 4.5 at Thayer: [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Diodorus_Siculus/4A*.html#5.2 Uchicago.edu]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beard ''et al'', 85-7: see also Polybius, 10.2.20, who suggests that Scipio's assumption of divine connections (and the personal favour of divine guidance) was unprecedented and seemed suspiciously "Greek" to his more conservative peers.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also Galinsky, 106, 126-49, for Heraklean/Herculean associations of Alexander, Scipio, and later triumphing Roman generals.&lt;/ref&gt; His sumptuous triumphal chariot was bedecked with [[fascinus|charms]] against the possible envy (''[[invidia]]'') and malice of onlookers.&lt;ref&gt;Versnel, p. 380.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Various Roman sources describe the different charms employed against envy during triumphs, not necessarily at the same event; they include an assemblage of miniature bells  (''[[Tintinnabulum (Ancient Rome)|tintinnabulum]]'') and a whip on the chariot's dashboard. In Pliny, a sacred [[Fascinus|phallos]] loaned by the [[Vestal Virgins]] is slung between the chariot wheels; see Beard, pp. 83–85.&lt;/ref&gt; In some accounts, a companion or [[servus publicus|public slave]] would remind him from time to time of his own mortality (a ''[[memento mori]]'').&lt;ref&gt;The very few accounts are from the Imperial era of a public slave (or other figure) who stands behind or near the triumphator to remind him that he "is but mortal" or prompts him to "look behind", and are open to a variety of interpretations. Nevertheless, they imply a tradition that the triumphing general was publicly reminded of his mortal nature, whatever his kingly appearance, temporary godlike status, or divine associations. See Beard, pp.&amp;nbsp;272–5.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The procession===
Rome's earliest "triumphs" were probably simple victory parades, celebrating the return of a victorious general and his army to the city, along with the fruits of his victory, and ending with some form of dedication to the gods. This is probably so for the earliest legendary and later semi-legendary triumphs of Rome's regal era, when the king functioned as Rome's highest magistrate and war-leader. As Rome's population, power, influence, and territory increased, so did the scale, length, variety, and extravagance of its triumphal processions.

The procession (''pompa'') mustered in the open space of the [[Campus Martius]] (Field of Mars)  probably well before first light. From there, all unforeseen delays and accidents aside, it would have managed a slow walking pace at best, punctuated by various planned stops en route to its final destination of the Capitoline temple, a distance of just under 4&amp;nbsp;km. Triumphal processions were notoriously long and slow;&lt;ref&gt;Emperor [[Vespasian]] regretted his triumph because its vast length and slow movement bored him; see Suetonius, ''Vespasian'', 12.&lt;/ref&gt; the longest could last for two or three days, and possibly more, and some may have been of greater length than the route itself.&lt;ref&gt;The "2,700 wagonloads of captured weapons alone, never mind the soldiers and captives and booty" on one day of [[Lucius Aemilius Paullus Macedonicus|Aemilius Paulus]]'s triumphal "extravaganza" of 167 BCE is wild exaggeration. Some modern scholarship suggests a procession 7 km long as plausible. See Beard, p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some ancient and modern sources suggest a fairly standard processional order. First came the captive leaders, allies, and soldiers (and sometimes their families) usually walking in chains; some were destined for execution or further display. Their captured weapons, armour, gold, silver, statuary, and curious or exotic treasures were carted behind them, along with paintings, tableaux, and models depicting significant places and episodes of the war. Next in line, all on foot, came Rome's senators and magistrates, followed by the general's [[lictor]]s in their red war-robes, their [[fasces]] wreathed in laurel, then the general in his four-horse chariot. A companion, or a public slave, might share the chariot with him or, in some cases, his youngest children. His officers and elder sons rode horseback nearby. His unarmed soldiers followed in togas and laurel crowns, chanting "io triumphe!" and singing ribald songs at their general's expense. Somewhere in the procession, two flawless white oxen were led for the sacrifice to Jupiter, garland-decked and with gilded horns. All this was done to the accompaniment of music, clouds of incense, and the strewing of flowers.&lt;ref&gt;Summary based on Versnel, pp. 95–96.&lt;/ref&gt;

Almost nothing is known of the procession's infrastructure and management. Its doubtless enormous cost was defrayed in part by the state but mostly by the general's loot, which most ancient sources dwell on in great detail and unlikely superlatives. Once disposed, this portable wealth injected huge sums into the Roman economy; the amount brought in by [[Octavian]]'s triumph over Egypt triggered a fall in interest rates and a sharp rise in land prices.&lt;ref&gt;Beard, pp. 159–161, citing Suetonius, ''Augustus'', 41.1.&lt;/ref&gt; No ancient source addresses the logistics of the procession: where the soldiers and captives, in a procession of several days, could have slept and eaten, or where these several thousands plus the spectators could have been stationed for the final ceremony at the Capitoline temple.&lt;ref&gt;Beard, pp. 93–95, 258. For their joint triumph of 71 CE, [[Titus]] and [[Vespasian]] treated their soldiers to a very early, and possibly traditional "triumphal breakfast".&lt;/ref&gt;

===The route===
The following schematic is for the route taken by "some, or many" triumphs, and is based on standard modern reconstructions.&lt;ref&gt;See map, in Beard, p. 334, and discussion on pp. 92–105.&lt;/ref&gt; Any original or traditional route would have been diverted to some extent by the city's many redevelopments and re-building, or sometimes by choice. The starting place (the Campus Martius) lay outside the city's sacred boundary (''[[pomerium]]'') on the western bank of the [[Tiber]]. The procession entered the city through a ''Porta Triumphalis'' (Triumphal Gate),&lt;ref&gt;The location and nature of the ''Porta Triumphalis'' are among the most uncertain and disputed aspects of the triumphal route; some sources imply a gate exclusively dedicated to official processions, others a free-standing arch, or the ''[[Porta Carmentalis]]'' by another name, or any convenient gate in the vicinity. See discussion in Beard, pp. 97–101.&lt;/ref&gt; and crossed the ''pomerium'', where the general surrendered his command to the [[Roman Senate|senate]] and [[Magistratus|magistrates]]. It continued through the site of the [[Circus Flaminius]], skirting the southern base of the Capitoline Hill and the ''Velabrum'', along a ''Via Triumphalis'' (Triumphal Way)&lt;ref&gt;Sometimes thought to be the same route as the modern ''[[Via dei Fori Imperiali]]''&lt;/ref&gt; towards the ''[[Circus Maximus]]'', perhaps dropping off any prisoners destined for execution at the [[Tullianum]].&lt;ref&gt;This is where [[Jugurtha]] was starved to death and [[Vercingetorix]] was strangled.&lt;/ref&gt; It entered the ''[[Via Sacra]]'' then the [[Roman Forum|Forum]]. Finally, it ascended the [[Capitoline Hill]] to the [[Temple of Jupiter Capitolinus]]. Once the sacrifice and dedications were completed, the procession and spectators dispersed to banquets, games, and other entertainments sponsored by the triumphing general.

===Banquets, games, and entertainments===
In most triumphs, the general funded any post-procession banquets from his share of the loot. There were feasts for the people and separate, much richer feasts for the elite; some went on for most of the night. [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus|Dionysus]] offers a contrast to the lavish triumphal banquets of his time by giving Romulus's triumph the most primitive possible "banquet" – ordinary Romans setting up food-tables as a "welcome home", and the returning troops taking swigs and bites as they marched by. He recreates the first Republican triumphal banquet along the same lines.&lt;ref&gt;Beard, pp. 258–259; cf Livy's "soldiers feasting as they went" at the triumph of [[Lucius Quinctius Cincinnatus|Cincinnatus]] (458 BCE).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marcus Terentius Varro|Varro]] claims that his aunt earned 20,000 [[Sestertius|sesterces]] by supplying 5,000 [[Thrush (bird)|thrushes]] for [[Caecilius Metellus]]'s triumph of 71 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Beard, p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some triumphs included [[ludi]] as fulfillment of the general's vow to a god or goddess, made before battle or during its heat, in return for their help in securing victory.&lt;ref&gt;Beard, pp. 263–264.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Republic, they were paid for by the triumphing general. [[Marcus Fulvius Nobilior (consul 189 BC)|Marcus Fulvius Nobilior]] vowed ''ludi'' in return for victory over the [[Aetolian League]] and paid for ten days of games at his triumph.

===Commemoration===
[[Image:Sack of jerusalem.JPG|thumb|Detail from the [[Arch of Titus]] showing his triumph held in 71 for his successful [[Siege of Jerusalem (70)|Sack of Jerusalem]].]]
Most Romans would never have seen a triumph, but its symbolism permeated Roman imagination and material culture. Triumphal generals minted and circulated high value coins to propagate their triumphal fame and generosity empire-wide. Pompey's issues for his three triumphs are typical.  One is an [[aureus]] (a gold coin) that has a laurel-wreathed border enclosing a head which personifies Africa; beside it, Pompey's title "Magnus" ("The Great"), with [[lituus|wand]] and [[libation#Ancient Rome|jug]] as symbols of his [[augur]]y. The reverse identifies him as [[proconsul]] in a triumphal chariot attended by [[Victoria (mythology)|Victory]]. A triumphal [[denarius]] (a silver coin) shows his three trophies of captured arms, with his augur's wand and jug. Another shows a globe surrounded by triumphal wreaths, symbolising his "world conquest", and an ear of grain to show that his victory protected Rome's grain supply.&lt;ref&gt;Beard pp. 19–21,&lt;/ref&gt;

In Republican tradition, a general was expected to wear his triumphal regalia only for the day of his triumph; thereafter, they were presumably displayed in the atrium of his family home. As one of the nobility, he was entitled to a particular kind of funeral in which a string of actors walked behind his bier wearing the [[Roman funerals and burial#Imagines|masks]] of his ancestors; another actor represented the general himself and his highest achievement in life by wearing his funeral mask, triumphal laurels, and ''toga picta''.&lt;ref&gt;Flower, Harriet I., ''Ancestor Masks and Aristocratic Power in Roman Culture'', Oxford University Press, 1999, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; Anything more was deeply suspect; Pompey was granted the privilege of wearing his triumphal wreath at the Circus, but he met with a hostile reception.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Lily Ross, ''The Divinity of the Roman Emperor'', American Philological Association, 1931 (reprinted by Arno Press, 1975), p. 57, citing Cicero, To Atticus, 1.18.6, and Velleius Paterculus, 2.40.4. Faced with this reaction, Pompey never tried it again.&lt;/ref&gt; Julius Caesar's penchant for wearing his triumphal regalia "wherever and whenever" was taken as one among many signs of monarchical intentions which, for some, justified his murder. In the Imperial era, emperors wore such regalia to signify their elevated rank and office and to identify themselves with the Roman gods and Imperial order – a central feature of [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)|Imperial cult]].

The building and dedication of monumental public works offered local, permanent opportunities for triumphal commemoration; some examples follow. In 55 BCE, [[Pompey]] inaugurated Rome's first stone-built Theatre as a gift to the people of Rome, funded by his spoils. Its gallery and colonnades doubled as an exhibition space and likely contained statues, paintings, and other trophies carried at his various triumphs.&lt;ref&gt;Beard, pp. 23–25.&lt;/ref&gt; It contained a new temple to Pompey's patron goddess [[Venus (mythology)|Venus Victrix]] ("Victorious Venus"); the year before, he had issued a coin which showed her crowned with triumphal laurels.&lt;ref&gt;Beard, pp. 22–23.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Julius Caesar]] claimed Venus as both patron and divine ancestress; he funded a new temple to her and dedicated it during his quadruple triumph of 46 BCE. He thus wove his patron goddess and putative ancestress into his triumphal anniversary.

[[Augustus]], Caesar's heir and Rome's first emperor, built a vast triumphal monument on the Greek coast at [[Actium]], overlooking the scene of his decisive sea-battle against Antony and Egypt; the [[Naval ram|bronze beaks]] of captured Egyptian warships projected from its seaward wall. Imperial iconography increasingly identified Emperors with the gods, starting with the Augustan reinvention of Rome as a virtual monarchy (the [[principate]]). Sculpted panels on the [[arch of Titus]] (built by [[Domitian]]) celebrate [[Titus]]' and [[Vespasian]]'s joint triumph over the Jews after the [[Siege of Jerusalem (70)|siege of Jerusalem]], with a triumphal procession of captives and treasures seized from the temple of Jerusalem – some of which funded the building of the [[Colosseum]]. Another panel shows the funeral and [[apotheosis]] of the [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)#Divus, deus and the numen|deified]] Titus. Prior to this, the senate voted Titus [[Arch of Titus (Circus Maximus)|a triple-arch at the Circus Maximus]] to celebrate or commemorate the same victory or triumph.&lt;ref&gt;Fergus Millar, "Last Year in Jerusalem: Monuments of the Jewish War in Rome", in ''Flavius Josephus and Flavian Rome'', J. C. Edmondson, Steve Mason, J. B. Rives (eds.), pp. 101–124.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awarding a triumph==
In [[Roman Republic|Republican]] tradition, only the [[Roman Senate|Senate]] could grant a triumph. A general who wanted a triumph would dispatch his request and report to the Senate. Officially, triumphs were granted for outstanding military merit; the state paid for the ceremony if this and certain other conditions were met – and these seem to have varied from time to time, and from case to case — or the Senate would pay for the official procession, at least. Most Roman historians rest the outcome on an open Senatorial debate and vote, its legality confirmed by one of the [[legislative assemblies of the Roman Republic|people's assemblies]]; the senate and people thus controlled the state's coffers and rewarded or curbed its generals. Some triumphs seem to have been granted outright, with minimal debate. Some were turned down but went ahead anyway, with the general's direct appeal to the people over the senate and a promise of public games at his own expense. Others were blocked or granted only after interminable wrangling. Senators and generals alike were politicians, and Roman politics was notorious for its rivalries, shifting alliances, back-room dealings, and overt public bribery.&lt;ref&gt;Beard, 196−201.&lt;/ref&gt; The senate's discussions would likely have hinged on triumphal tradition, precedent, and propriety; less overtly but more anxiously, it would hinge on the extent of the general's political and military powers and popularity, and the possible consequences of supporting or hindering his further career. There is no firm evidence that the Senate applied a prescribed set of "triumphal laws" when making their decisions,&lt;ref&gt;See discussion in Beard, pp. 199–206, 209–210. [[Livy]]'s "triumphal laws" hark back to earlier, traditional but probably reinvented triumphs of Republican Rome's expansion to Empire and its defeat of foreign kings; his notion was that triumphal generals must possess the highest level of ''imperium'' (Livy, 38.38.4, in the 206 BCE case of [[Scipio Africanus]]), but this is contradicted in [[Polybius]] 11.33.7 and [[Pompey]]'s status at his first triumph.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The tradition was probably an indication of esteem and popularity that triumphal generals in the Republic had been spontaneously proclaimed as ''imperator'' by their troops in the field; it was not an absolute requirement (see Beard, p. 275). Taking divine [[auspices]] before battle might have been formally reserved to the highest magistrate on the field, while a victory proved that a commander must have pleased the gods – whatever the niceties of his authority. Conversely, a lost battle was a sure sign of religious dereliction; see Veit Rosenberger, "The Gallic Disaster", ''The Classical World'', (The Johns Hopkins University Press), 96, 4, 2003, p. 371, note 39.&lt;/ref&gt; although Valerius Maximus does claim that a triumph could only be granted to a victorious general who had slain at least 5,000 of the enemy in a single battle.&lt;ref&gt;Valerius Maximus, 2. 8. 1. &lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Principate]], triumphs became more politicized as manifestations of imperial authority and legitimacy.

===Ovation===
{{Main|Ovation}}
A general might be granted a "lesser triumph", known as an Ovation. He entered the city on foot, minus his troops, in his magistrate's toga and wearing a wreath of [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]]'s myrtle. In 211 BCE, the Senate turned down [[Marcus Claudius Marcellus|Marcus Marcellus]]'s request for a triumph after his victory over the Carthaginians and their Sicilian-Greek allies, apparently because his army was still in Sicily and unable to join him. They offered him instead a thanksgiving (supplicatio) and ovation. The day before it, he celebrated an unofficial triumph on the [[Alban Mount]]. His ovation was of triumphal proportions. It included a large painting, showing his siege of [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]], the siege engines themselves,  captured plate, gold, silver, and royal ornaments, and the statuary and opulent furniture for which Syracuse was famous. Eight elephants were led in the procession, symbols of his victory over the Carthaginians. His Spanish and Syracusan allies led the way wearing golden wreaths; they were granted Roman citizenship and lands in Sicily.&lt;ref&gt;[[Livy]], ''[[Ab Urbe Condita Libri (Livy)|Ab Urbe Condita]]'', 26, 21; cf. Plutarch ''Marcellus'' 19–22.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 71 BCE, [[Marcus Licinius Crassus|Crassus]] earned an ovation for quashing the [[Spartacus]] revolt, and increased his honours by wearing a crown of Jupiter's "triumphal" laurel.&lt;ref&gt;Beard, p. 265.&lt;/ref&gt; Ovations are listed along with triumphs on the ''Fasti Triumphales''.

==Sources==
[[File:CILI(2)p47fgtXXFastitriumphales.jpg|thumb|right|Segment XX of the ''Fasti triumphales'', a portion recording triumphs during the [[First Punic War]]]]
The ''[[Fasti Triumphales]]'' (also called ''Acta Triumphalia'') are stone tablets that were erected in the [[Forum Romanum]] around 12 BCE, during the reign of Emperor Augustus.&lt;!---note that there is still some debate as to whether Augustus was the first emperor---&gt; They give the general's formal name, the names of his father and grandfather, the people(s) or command province whence the triumph was awarded, and the date of the triumphal procession. They record over 200 triumphs, starting with three mythical triumphs of Romulus in 753 BCE and ending with that of [[Lucius Cornelius Balbus the Younger|Lucius Cornelius Balbus]] (19 BCE).&lt;ref&gt;Romulus' three triumphs are in Dionysius of Halicarnassus (''Antiquitates Romanae'', 2.54.2 &amp; 2.55.5). Dioysius may have seen the ''Fasti''. Livy (1.10.5-7) allows Romulus the ''[[spolia opima]]'', not a "triumph".  Neither author mentions the two triumphs attributed by the Fasti to the last king of Rome, Tarquin. See Beard, 74 and endnotes 1 &amp;2.&lt;/ref&gt; Fragments of similar date and style from Rome and provincial Italy appear to be modeled on the Augustan ''Fasti'', and have been used to fill some of its gaps.&lt;ref&gt;Beard, 61-2, 66-7. The standard modern edition of the Fasti Triumphales is that of [[Attilio Degrassi]], in ''Inscriptiones Italiae'', vol.XIII, fasc.1 (Rome, 1947)&lt;/ref&gt;

Many ancient historical accounts also mention triumphs. Most Roman accounts of triumphs were written to provide their readers with a moral lesson, rather than to provide an accurate description of the triumphal process, procession, rites, and their meaning. This scarcity allows only the most tentative and generalised (and possibly misleading) reconstruction of triumphal ceremony, based on the combination of various incomplete accounts from different periods of Roman history.

==Evolution==
===Origins and Regal era===
The origins and development of this honour are obscure. Roman historians placed the first triumph in the mythical past; some thought that it dated from [[Founding of Rome|Rome's foundation]]; others thought it more ancient than that. Roman etymologists thought that the soldiers' chant of ''triumpe'' was a borrowing via [[Etruscan language|Etruscan]] of the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ''[[thriambus]]'' (''θρίαμβος''), cried out by [[satyr]]s and other attendants in [[Dionysus|Dionysian]] and Bacchic processions.&lt;ref&gt;Versnel considers it an invocation for divine help and manifestation, derived via an unknown pre-Greek language through Etruria and Greece. He cites the chant of "''Triumpe''", repeated five times, which terminates the ''[[Carmen Arvale]]'', a now-obscure prayer for the help and protection of [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]] and the [[Lares]]. Versnel, pp. 39–55 (conclusion and summary on p. 55).&lt;/ref&gt; Plutarch and some Roman sources traced the first Roman triumph and the "kingly" garb of the ''triumphator'' to Rome's first king [[Romulus]], whose defeat of King Acron of the [[Caenina (Town)|Caeninenses]] was thought coeval with Rome's foundation in 753 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Beard et al, vol. 1, 44-5, 59-60: see also Plutarch, Romulus (trans. Dryden) at The Internet Classics Archive [http://classics.mit.edu/Plutarch/romulus.html MIT.edu]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ovid]] projected a fabulous and poetic triumphal precedent in the return of the god Bacchus/[[Dionysus]] from his conquest of India, drawn in a golden chariot by tigers and surrounded by [[maenads]], satyrs, and assorted drunkards.&lt;ref&gt;Bowersock, 1994, 157.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ovid, ''The Erotic Poems'', 1.2.19-52. Trans P. Green.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pliny attributes the invention of the triumph to "Father [[Liber]]" (identified with Dionysus): see Pliny, ''Historia Naturalis'', 7.57 (ed. Bostock) at Perseus: [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Plin.+Nat.+7.57 Tufts.edu]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arrian]] attributed similar Dionysian and "Roman" elements to a victory procession of [[Alexander the Great]].&lt;ref&gt;Bosworth, 67-79, notes that Arrian's attributions here are non-historic and their details almost certainly apocryphal: see Arrian, 6, 28, 1-2.&lt;/ref&gt; Like much in Roman culture, elements of the triumph were based on Etruscan and Greek precursors; in particular, the purple, embroidered ''toga picta'' worn by the triumphal general was thought to be derived from the royal toga of Rome's Etruscan kings.

For triumphs of the Roman regal era, the surviving Imperial ''Fasti Triumphales'' are incomplete. After three entries for the city's legendary founder [[Romulus]], eleven lines of the list are missing. Next in sequence are [[Ancus Marcius]], [[Tarquinius Priscus]], [[Servius Tullius]], and finally [[Lucius Tarquinius Superbus|Tarquin "the proud"]], the last king. The ''Fasti'' were compiled some five centuries after the regal era, and probably represent an approved, official version of several different historical traditions. Likewise, the earliest surviving written histories of the regal era, written some centuries after it, attempt to reconcile various traditions, or else debate their merits. [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus|Dionysus]], for example, gives Romulus three triumphs, the same number given in the ''Fasti''. Livy gives him none, and credits him instead with the first [[spolia opima]], in which the arms and armour were stripped off a defeated foe, then dedicated to Jupiter. Plutarch gives him one, complete with chariot. Tarquin has two triumphs in the ''Fasti'' but none in Dionysius.&lt;ref&gt;Beard, p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt; No ancient source gives a triumph to Romulus' successor, the peaceful king [[Numa Pompilius|Numa]].

===The Republic===
Rome's aristocrats expelled their last king as a tyrant and legislated the monarchy out of existence. They shared among themselves the kingship's former powers and authority in the form of [[Roman Magistrate|magistracies]]. In the Republic, the highest possible magistracy was an elected consulship, which could be held for no more than a year at a time. In times of crisis or emergency, the Senate might appoint a [[Roman dictator|dictator]] to serve a longer term; but this could seem perilously close to the lifetime power of kings. The dictator [[Marcus Furius Camillus|Camillus]] was awarded four triumphs but was eventually exiled. Later Roman sources point to his triumph of 396 BCE as a cause for offense; the chariot was drawn by four white horses, a combination properly reserved for Jupiter and Apollo – at least in later lore and poetry.&lt;ref&gt;Beard, p. 235.&lt;/ref&gt; The demeanour of a triumphal Republican general would have been closely scrutinised by his aristocratic peers, as well as the symbols which he employed in his triumph; they would be alert for any sign that he might aspire to be more than "king for a day".

In the Middle to Late Republic, Rome's expansion through conquest offered her political-military adventurers extraordinary opportunities for self-publicity; the long-drawn series of wars between Rome and Carthage – the [[Punic Wars]] – produced twelve triumphs in ten years. Towards the end of the Republic, triumphs became still more frequent,&lt;ref&gt;Beard, p. 42; four were clustered in one year (71 BCE), including Pompey's second triumph.&lt;/ref&gt; lavish, and competitive, with each display an attempt (usually successful) to outdo the last. To have a triumphal ancestor — even one long-dead — counted for a lot in Roman society and politics, and [[Cicero]] remarked that, in the race for power and influence, some individuals were not above vesting an inconveniently ordinary ancestor with triumphal grandeur and dignity, distorting an already fragmentary and unreliable historical tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''Brutus'', 62.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also Livy, 8, 40.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beard, 79, notes at least one ancient case of what seems blatant fabrication, in which two ancestral triumphs became three.&lt;/ref&gt;

To Roman historians, the growth of triumphal ostentation undermined Rome's ancient "peasant virtues".&lt;ref&gt;Beard, 67: citing Valerius Maximus, 4.4.5., and Apuleius, Apol.17&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] (c. 60 BCE to after 7 BCE) claimed that the triumphs of his day had "departed in every respect from the ancient tradition of frugality".&lt;ref&gt;Dionysus of Halicarnassus, ''Roman Antiquities'', 2.34.3.&lt;/ref&gt; Moralists complained that successful foreign wars might have increased Rome's power, security, and wealth, but they also created and fed a degenerate appetite for bombastic display and shallow novelty. Livy traces the start of the rot to the triumph of [[Gnaeus Manlius Vulso]] in 186, which introduced ordinary Romans to such [[Galatia]]n fripperies as specialist chefs, flute girls, and other "seductive dinner-party amusements". Pliny adds "sideboards and one-legged tables" to the list,&lt;ref&gt;Livy, 39.6-7: cf Pliny, ''Historia Naturalis'', 34.14.&lt;/ref&gt; but lays responsibility for Rome's slide into luxury on the "1400 pounds of chased silver ware and 1500 pounds of golden vessels" brought somewhat earlier by [[Lucius Cornelius Scipio Asiaticus|Scipio Asiaticus]] for his triumph of 189 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Beard, p. 162.&lt;/ref&gt;

The three triumphs awarded to [[Pompey the Great]] were lavish and controversial. The first in 80 or 81 BCE was for his victory over King Hiarbas of Numidia in 79 BCE, granted by a cowed and divided Senate under the dictatorship of Pompey's patron [[Sulla]]. Pompey was only 24 and a mere equestrian.&lt;ref&gt;Beard, 16; he was aged 25 or 26 in some accounts.&lt;/ref&gt;  Roman conservatives disapproved of such precocity&lt;ref&gt;Dio Cassius, 42.18.3.&lt;/ref&gt; but others saw his youthful success as the mark of a prodigious military talent, divine favour, and personal brio; and he also had an enthusiastic, popular following. His triumph, however, did not go quite to plan. His chariot was drawn by a team of elephants in order to represent his African conquest – and perhaps to outdo even the legendary triumph of Bacchus. They proved too bulky to pass through the triumphal gate, so Pompey had to dismount while a horse team was yoked in their place.&lt;ref&gt;Pliny, ''Historia Naturalis'', 8.4: Plutarch, ''Pompey'', 14.4.&lt;/ref&gt;  This embarrassment would have delighted his critics, and probably some of his soldiers — whose demands for cash had been near-mutinous.&lt;ref&gt;Beard, 16, 17.&lt;/ref&gt; Even so, his firm stand on the matter of cash raised his standing among the conservatives, and Pompey seems to have learned a lesson in populist politics. For his second triumph (71 BCE, the last in a series of four held that year) his cash gifts to his army were said to break all records, though the amounts in Plutarch's account are implausibly high: 6,000 ''[[sesterces]]'' to each soldier (about six times their annual pay) and about 5 million to each officer.&lt;ref&gt;Beard, 39-40, notes that the introduction of such vast sums into the Roman economy would have left substantial traces, but none are evidenced (citing Brunt (1971), 459-60; Scheidel (1996); Duncan-Jones (1990), 43, &amp; (1994), 253).&lt;/ref&gt;

Pompey was granted a third triumph in 61 BCE to celebrate his victory over [[Mithridates VI of Pontus]]. It was an opportunity to outdo all rivals — and even himself. Triumphs traditionally lasted for one day, but Pompey's went on for two in an unprecedented display of wealth and luxury.&lt;ref&gt;Beard, 9, cites Appian's very doubtful "75,100,000" drachmae carried in the procession as 1.5 times his own estimate of Rome's total annual tax revenue (Appian, ''Mithradates'', 116).&lt;/ref&gt;  Plutarch claimed that this triumph represented Pompey's domination over the entire world – on Rome's behalf – and an achievement to outshine even Alexander's.&lt;ref&gt;Beard, 15-16, citing Plutarch, Pompey, 45, 5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beard, 16. For further elaboration on Pompey's 3rd triumph, see also Plutarch, ''Sertorius'', 18, 2, at Thayer [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Sertorius*.html Uchicago.edu]: Cicero, Man. 61: Pliny, Nat. 7, 95.&lt;/ref&gt; Pliny's narrative of this triumph dwells with ominous hindsight upon a gigantic portrait-bust of the triumphant general, a thing of "eastern splendor" entirely covered with pearls, anticipating his later humiliation and decapitation.&lt;ref&gt;Beard, 35: Pliny, Historia Naturalis, 37, 14-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Caesar's murder, Octavian assumed permanent title of ''imperator'' and became permanent head of the Senate from 27 BCE (see [[principate]]) under the title and name [[Augustus (honorific)|Augustus]]. Only the year before, he had blocked the senatorial award of a triumph to [[Marcus Licinius Crassus (consul 30 BC)|Marcus Licinius Crassus the Younger]], despite the latter's acclamation in the field as Imperator and his fulfillment of all traditional, Republican qualifying criteria except full consulship. Technically, generals in the Imperial era were [[Legatus|legates]] of the ruling Emperor (Imperator).&lt;ref&gt;Beard, pp. 297–298.&lt;/ref&gt;  Augustus claimed the victory as his own but permitted Crassus a second, which is listed on the ''Fasti'' for 27 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Syme, 272-5: [https://books.google.com/books?id=fj8oQ4lzteIC&amp;pg=PA270&amp;dq=%22descendants+of+crassus%22+intitle:augustan+intitle:aristocracy+inauthor:syme&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;as_brr=0&amp;as_pt=ALLTYPES#PPA274,M1 Google Books Search]&lt;/ref&gt; Crassus was also denied the rare (and technically permissible, in his case) honour of dedicating the ''[[spolia opima]]'' of this campaign to [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter Feretrius]].&lt;ref&gt;Southern, 104: [https://books.google.com/books?id=v8dOBMbVW1cC&amp;pg=RA2-PA104&amp;lpg=RA2-PA104&amp;dq=Crassus+Triumph+Augustus+spolia+opima&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=JwN8LD0JvF&amp;sig=8kQkm5D6GQy2QYc154aASwkU9KM&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=wPswSpKMBNGTjAf7m4zWBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1#PRA2-PA104,M1 Google Books Search]&lt;/ref&gt;

The last triumph listed on the ''Fasti Triumphales'' is for 19 BCE. By then, the triumph had been absorbed into the Augustan [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)|Imperial cult]] system, in which only the emperor&lt;ref&gt;Very occasionally, a close relative who had glorified the Imperial ''gens'' might receive the honor.&lt;/ref&gt;  would be accorded such a supreme honour, as he was the supreme ''Imperator''. The Senate, in true Republican style, would have held session to debate and decide the merits of the candidate; but this was little more than good form. Augustan ideology insisted that Augustus had saved and restored the Republic, and it celebrated his triumph as a permanent condition, and his military, political, and religious leadership as responsible for an unprecedented era of stability, peace, and prosperity. From then on, emperors claimed – without seeming to claim – the triumph as an Imperial privilege. Those outside the Imperial family might be granted "triumphal ornaments" (''Ornamenta triumphalia'') or an ovation, such as [[Aulus Plautius]] under [[Claudius]]. The senate still debated and voted on such matters, though the outcome was probably already decided.&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''Lives'', Claudius, 24.3: given for the [[Roman conquest of Britain|conquest of Britain]]. Claudius was "granted" a triumph by the Senate and gave "triumphal regalia" to his prospective son-in-law, who was still "only a boy." Thayer: [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Claudius*.html Uchicago.edu] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120630034237/http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Claudius*.html |date=2012-06-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Imperial era, the number of triumphs fell sharply.&lt;ref&gt;Beard, 61–71.&lt;/ref&gt;

Imperial panegyrics of the later Imperial era combine triumphal elements with Imperial ceremonies such as the consular investiture of Emperors, and the ''[[Adventus (ceremony)|adventus]]'', the formal "triumphal" arrival of an emperor in the various capitals of the Empire in his progress through the provinces. Some emperors were perpetually on the move and seldom or never went to Rome.&lt;ref&gt;On triumphal entrances to Rome in the fourth century, see discussion in Schmidt-Hofner, pp. 33–60, and Wienand, pp. 169–197.&lt;/ref&gt; Christian emperor [[Constantius II]] entered Rome for the first time in his life in 357, several years after defeating his rival [[Magnentius]], standing in his triumphal chariot "as if he were a statue".&lt;ref&gt;Beard pp. 322–323.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Theodosius I]] celebrated his victory over the usurper [[Magnus Maximus]] in Rome on June 13, 389.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livius.org/person/theodosius-i/|title=Theodosius I - Livius|author=|date=|website=www.livius.org|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150429115503/http://www.livius.org/person/theodosius-i/|archivedate=2015-04-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Claudian]]'s panegyric to Emperor [[Honorius (emperor)|Honorius]] records the last known official triumph in the city of Rome and the western Empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Claudian|title=Panegyricus de Sexto Consulatu Honorii Augusti|year=404|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Claudian/De_VI_Consulatu_Honorii*.html|accessdate=21 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beard, 326.&lt;/ref&gt; Emperor [[Honorius (emperor)|Honorius]] celebrated it conjointly with his sixth consulship on January 1, 404; his general [[Stilicho]] had defeated [[Visigoths|Visigothic]] King [[Alaric I|Alaric]] at the battles of [[Battle of Pollentia|Pollentia]] and [[Battle of Verona (402)|Verona]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gibbon|first=Edward|title=The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire|chapter=Chapter XXX|pages=39–41|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YmABAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA39&amp;lpg=PA39&amp;dq=triumph+404+a.d.+honorius&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=dEmhzXpFKI&amp;sig=CsOCzwGrs1y-G926dQwspIcmxSY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=8dIUUsaXNYSs2wWfk4DQBg&amp;ved=0CEsQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=triumph%20404%20a.d.%20honorius&amp;f=false|year=1776–89 |accessdate=21 August 2013|quote=After the retreat of the barbarians, Honorius was directed to accept the dutiful invitation of the senate, and to celebrate, in the Imperial city, the auspicious aera of the Gothic victory, and of his sixth consulship.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Christian [[martyrology]], [[Saint Telemachus]] was martyred by a mob while attempting to stop the customary [[gladiator]]ial [[Ludi|games]] at this triumph, and gladiatorial games (''munera gladiatoria'') were banned in consequence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wace|first=Henry|title=Dictionary of Christian Biography and Literature to the End of the Sixth Century A.D., with an Account of the Principal Sects and Heresies|chapter=Entry for "Honorius, Flavius Augustus, emperor"|year=1911|url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/wace/biodict.html?term=Honorius,%20Flavius%20Augustus,%20emperor|accessdate=21 August 2013|quote=The customary games took place with great magnificence, and on this occasion St. Telemachus sacrificed himself by attempting to separate the gladiators.|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141021100724/http://www.ccel.org/ccel/wace/biodict.html?term=Honorius,%20Flavius%20Augustus,%20emperor|archivedate=21 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Theodoret]]|year=449-50|title=Ecclesiastical History|chapter=Book V, chapter 26|url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/27025.htm|accessdate=21 August 2013|quote=When the admirable emperor was informed of this he numbered Telemachus in the array of victorious martyrs, and put an end to that impious spectacle.|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130920225816/http://newadvent.org/fathers/27025.htm|archivedate=20 September 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Foxe|first=John|title=Actes and Monuments (a.k.a.

In 534, well into the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine era]], [[Justinian I]] awarded general [[Belisarius]] a triumph that included some "radically new" [[Christianity|Christian]] and Byzantine elements. Belisarius successfully campaigned against his adversary Vandal leader [[Gelimer]] to restore the former [[Roman province of Africa]] to the control of [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantium]] in the 533-534 [[Vandalic War]]. The triumph was held in the Eastern Roman capital of [[Constantinople]]. Historian [[Procopius]], an eyewitness who had previously been in Belisarius's service, describes the procession's display of the loot seized from the [[Temple of Jerusalem]] in 70 CE by Roman Emperor [[Titus]], including the [[Menorah (Temple)|Temple Menorah]]. The treasure had been stored in Rome's [[Temple of Peace, Rome|Temple of Peace]] after its display in Titus' own triumphal parade and its depiction on [[Arch of Titus|his triumphal arch]]; then it was seized by the [[Vandals]] during their [[Sack of Rome (455)|sack of Rome]] in 455; then it was taken from them in Belisarius' campaign. The objects themselves might well have recalled the ancient triumphs of Vespasian and his son Titus; but Belisarius and Gelimer walked, as in an [[ovation]]. The procession did not end at Rome's [[Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus|Capitoline Temple]] with a sacrifice to Jupiter, but terminated at [[Hippodrome of Constantinople]] with a recitation of Christian prayer and the triumphant generals prostrate before the emperor.&lt;ref&gt;Beard, 318–321. Procopius' account is the source for a "marvelous set piece" of Belisarius' triumph, in [[Robert Graves]]' historical novel [[Count Belisarius]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence and reception==

During the [[Renaissance]], kings and magnates sought ennobling connections with the classical past. [[Ghibelline]] [[Castruccio Castracani]] defeated the forces of the [[Guelphs and Ghibellines|Guelph]] [[Republic of Florence|Florence]] in the 1325 [[Battle of Altopascio]]. Holy Roman Emperor [[Louis IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Louis IV]] made him [[Duchy of Lucca|Duke of Lucca]], and the city gave him a Roman-style triumph. The procession was led by his Florentine captives, made to carry candles in honour of Lucca's patron saint. Castracani followed, standing in a decorative chariot. His booty included the Florentine's portable, wheeled altar, the ''[[carroccio]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Zaho and Bernstein, 2004, p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Flavio Biondo]]'s ''Roma Triumphans'' (1459) claimed the ancient Roman triumph, divested of its pagan rites, as a rightful inheritance of Holy Roman Emperors.&lt;ref&gt;Beard, p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; Italian poet [[Petrarch]]'s "The Triumphs" represented the triumphal themes and biographies of ancient Roman texts as ideals for cultured, virtuous rule; it was influential and widely read.&lt;ref&gt;Zaho and Bernstein, 2004, pp. 4, 31 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Andrea Mantegna]]'s series of large paintings on the ''[[Triumphs of Caesar]]'' (1484–92, now [[Hampton Court Palace]]) became immediately famous and was endlessly copied in [[old master print|print]] form. The ''[[Triumphal Procession]]'' commissioned by [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]] (1512–19) from a group of artists including [[Albrecht Dürer]] was a series of [[woodcut]]s of an imaginary triumph of his own that could be hung as a [[frieze]] {{convert|54|m|ft}} long.

In the 1550s, the fragmentary ''Fasti Triumphales'' were unearthed and partially restored. [[Onofrio Panvinio]]'s ''Fasti'' continued where the ancient ''Fasti'' left off.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=kmMNon1nRr4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=De+fasti+et+triumphi+Romanorum+a+Romulo+usque+ad+Carolum+V+madrid&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ViUWUvmmN8bF2AXhrYCADA&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''De fasti et triumphi Romanorum a Romulo usque ad Carolum V''], Giacomo Strada, Venice, 1557 (Latin text, accessed 22 August 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; The last triumph recorded by Panvinio was the [[Royal Entry]] of [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] into Rome on April 5, 1536, after his [[Conquest of Tunis (1535)|conquest of Tunis]] in 1535.&lt;ref&gt;Beard, p. 53; in preparation, Pope Paul III arranged the clearance of any buildings that obstructed the traditional ''Via Triumphalis''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pinson|first=Yona|year=2001|title=Imperial Ideology in the Triumphal Entry into Lille of Charles V and the Crown Prince (1549)|journal=Assaph: Studies in Art History|volume=6|page=212|url=http://www2.tau.ac.il/InternetFiles/Segel/Art/UserFiles/file/09pinson.pdf|format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]|quote=Already in his Imperial Triumphal Entry into Rome (1536) the Emperor appeared as a triumphant Roman Imperator: mounted on a white horse and wearing a purple cape, he embodied the figure of the ancient conqueror.

The Emperor followed the traditional ancient route, "past the ruins of the triumphal arches of the soldier-emperors of Rome", where "actors dressed as ancient senators hailed the return of the new Caesar as ''miles christi''," (a soldier of Christ).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Frieder|first=Braden|title=Chivalry &amp; the Perfect Prince: Tournaments, Art, and Armor at the Spanish Habsburg Court|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=NFtMbrAHZpsC&amp;redir_esc=|date=28 December 2016|publisher=[[Truman State University Press]]|isbn=978-1-931112-69-7|page=80|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170510133612/https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=NFtMbrAHZpsC&amp;redir_esc=|archivedate=10 May 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The extravagant triumphal entry into [[Rouen]] of [[Henri II of France]] in 1550 was not "less pleasing and delectable than the third triumph of Pompey&amp;nbsp;... magnificent in riches and abounding in the spoils of foreign nations".&lt;ref&gt;Beard, 31. See 32, Fig. 7 for a contemporary depiction of Henri's "Romanised" procession.&lt;/ref&gt; A triumphal arch made for the Royal entry into Paris of [[Louis XIII of France]] in 1628 carried a depiction of Pompey.&lt;ref&gt;Beard, 343, footnote 65.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Sardinia International Ethnographic Film Festival''''' (SIEFF) is an International [[Ethnographic film]] Festival based in Nuoro ([[Sardinia]] - Italy) organized by the [[Istituto superiore regionale etnografico]] (the ''Sardinian Regional Institute of Ethnography'').
The festival, born in 1982 (with the name ''Festival Internazionale Biennale di Film Etnografici'') in conjunction with the ''Bilan du Film Ethnographique'' by [[Jean Rouch]], (now ''Jean Rouch Festival'') housed in the [[Musée de l'Homme]] in Paris, is the oldest ethnographic cinema festival in [[Europe]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isresardegna.it/index.php?xsl=527&amp;s=16&amp;v=9&amp;c=4083 on line on Isre Sardegna, ''Compiti e attività'']&lt;/ref&gt;.
The event is held every two years and takes place in the Auditorium of '''Museo della vita e delle tradizioni popolari sarde''' (''Museum of Sardinian folk life and traditions'') in [[Nuoro]].
From 1982 to 2006 the exhibition was dedicated from time to time to a specific theme&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sentieriselvaggi.it/sardinia-international-ethnographic-film-festival/ ''Sardinia International Ethnographic Film Festival'' on line on '''Sentieri Selvaggi''', 12 maggio 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;; since 2006 the Festival has abandoned the traditional monothematic characterization and has focused its program on a selection of recent films, guided by an ethno-anthropological perspective.

The festival has an international character and for the selection the films come from all over the world. As well as the committee for the selection of films, which is regularly composed of representatives of various institutions, which in the world deal with [[visual anthropology]].

{{nihongo|'''''Shika Wakashū'''''|詞花和歌集|"Collection of Verbal Flowers"}}, abbreviated as '''''Shikashū''''', is an [[imperial anthology]] of [[Japanese poetry|Japanese]] [[Waka (poetry)|waka]], compiled c.1151&amp;ndash;1154 [[Common Era|CE]] at the behest of the [[Daijō-tennō|Emperor]] [[Emperor Sutoku|Sutoku]] who ordered it in 1144. It was compiled by Fujiwara no Akisuke (1090&amp;ndash;1155; a member of the [[Rokujō family|Rokujō]]). It consists of ten volumes containing 411 poems.

The ''Shikashū'' is the shortest of the imperial anthologies. Despite Akisuke's ostensibly conservative nature, it is rather eclectic and has a wide variety of poems.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1644">The '''Société littéraire de Liège''' was a literary society in [[Liège]].

It was set up on 5 April 1779 by [[François-Charles de Velbrück]] during his reign as [[prince bishop of Liege]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.societelitteraire.be/fr/presentation/historique|title=Historique|last=|first=|date=|website=www.societelitteraire.be|language=fr-fr|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; It aimed to provide its members with newspapers and books in a convivial atmosphere, on the model of other literary societies of the time, like the Cabinet littéraire de Verviers, the Société littéraire de Huy, the Société royale littéraire de Hasselt, the Cercle de l’Union de Maastricht, the "Aachener Casino Club" in [[Aachen]], the Société littéraire de Gand, the Société de littérature de Bruxelles (whose successor, the Société des Douze, is still active), and the famous [[Gabinetto Vieusseux]].

It is still active and provides cultural activities and meeting for its members. It has reciprocal ties with the [[Cercle Gaulois]] in Brussels and publishes a quarterly newsletter entitled ''Lettre de la Littéraire''.

'''''The Spear''''' is a painting by [[Cape Town]]-based South African artist, [[Brett Murray]].  It depicts South African President [[Jacob Zuma]] in a pose reminiscent of [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]], with his genitals exposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Govender|first=Peroshni|title=Presidential penis portrait riles S. Africa's ANC|url=https://af.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFJOE84H07820120518|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=19 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The painting triggered a defamation lawsuit by Zuma's party, the [[African National Congress]] (ANC), and was vandalised on 22 May 2012.

== Exhibition ==
Prior to its being vandalised, ''The Spear'' was shown at the Goodman Gallery in [[Johannesburg]], South Africa.  The painting featured as one of the pieces of artist Brett Murray's ''Hail to the Thief II'' exhibition, which commenced on 10 May 2012.&lt;ref name=Goodman/&gt; Inspiration is understood to have been drawn from the [[Viktor Semyonovich Ivanov]]'s poster ''Lenin Lived, Lenin is Alive, Lenin Will Live''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The painting of President Zuma|url=http://inside-politics.org/2012/05/17/the-painting-of-president-zuma/|work=www.inside-politics.org|accessdate=7 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exhibition features various pieces that are critical of South Africa's ruling party, the ANC, showcasing sculptures and images that suggest [[corruption]] and bad governance.&lt;ref name=Goodman&gt;{{cite web|title=Goodman Gallery - Hail to the Thief II|url=http://www.goodman-gallery.com/exhibitions/265|publisher=Goodman Gallery|accessdate=19 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Murray's works in the exhibition also include modifying ANC liberation struggle posters and flyers from the [[Apartheid]] era, some displaying the text "Amandla, we demand Chivas, BMWs and bribes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iol.co.za/saturday-star/it-s-staying-up-1.1302261 |title=It’s staying up! |author=Sameer Naik and Kashiefa Ajam |date=22 May 2012 |work=The Saturday Star |accessdate=22 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Public perception of Jacob Zuma ==
Zuma has often been the centre of scandal and ridicule, due to his polygamous lifestyle with many wives and girlfriends,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jacob Zuma - "Polygamy is part of my culture"|url=http://www.rnw.nl/africa/article/jacob-zuma-polygamy-part-my-culture|publisher=Radio Netherlands Worldwide|accessdate=19 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a comment he made during his 2006 [[Jacob Zuma rape trial|rape trial]] that showering after sex would minimise the risk of contracting [[HIV]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=SA's Zuma 'showered to avoid HIV'|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4879822.stm|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=19 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His lifestyle has made him the target of well-known cartoonist [[Zapiro]], who frequently depicts Zuma with a shower on his head, ridiculing the statements he made during his trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nicolaides|first=Gia|title=Zapiro revives showerhead|url=http://news.iafrica.com/sa/574737.html|publisher=iafrica.com|accessdate=19 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zapiro was also sued for defamation by the ANC, with a hearing expected in October 2012.&lt;ref name=BBC185 /&gt; These public perceptions of Zuma provided part of the basis for Brett Murray's painting.&lt;ref name=BBC185&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-18115724 |title=Jacob Zuma painting: ANC to sue South Africa's Brett Murray |date=18 May 2012 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=22 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zapiro added fuel to the fire by doing his own version of the painting, replacing the genitals with a showerhead.&lt;ref name=Zapiro185&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.zapiro.com/cartoon/890737-120520st |title=Published in Sunday Times on 20 May 2012 |date=20 May 2012 |publisher=Zapiro |accessdate=24 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another appeared two days later, ridiculing Zuma.&lt;ref name=Zapiro186&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.zapiro.com/cartoon/892612-120522tt |title=120522tt - President Zuma outraged at Brett Murray's Painting - Spear of the Nation |date=22 May 2012 |publisher=Zapiro |accessdate=24 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== ANC response ==

Owner and director of the Goodman Gallery, Liza Essers, said that she received a telephone call on Sunday, 13 May 2012 from special advisor to the minister of arts and culture Mduduzi Mbata seeking to clarify her thoughts on the exhibition, after it had been reviewed in the newspaper [[City Press (South Africa)|''City Press'']], along with a photograph of ''The Spear''. During the brief conversation she invited him to visit the gallery the following Tuesday, but he never kept the appointment.&lt;ref name=AiA&gt;{{cite web|last=Dubin|first=Steven|title=Liza Essers, Gallery Owner, on the Show that Scandalized South Africa|url=http://www.artinamericamagazine.com/news-opinion/conversations/2012-06-05/liza-essers-brent-murray-goodman-gallery/|work=Art in America|publisher=Art in America|accessdate=7 June 2012|date=5 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The ANC issued a press release on 17 May 2012 expressing outrage about the painting and their intention to apply to the High Court to have it removed, this being reiterated by attorneys representing the ANC and Jacob Zuma in an email sent to Essers the same day.&lt;ref name=AiA/&gt; The painting drew strong condemnation from ANC rulers and various religious groups, who found the painting 'obscene' and 'vulgar'.&lt;ref name="mosomane1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Mosomane|first=Phuti|title=Zuma painting against Ubuntu, African morality, culture|url=http://www.thenewage.co.za/Detail.aspx?news_id=51152&amp;cat_id=1007|publisher=The New Age|accessdate=19 May 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150526184457/http://www.thenewage.co.za/Detail.aspx?news_id=51152&amp;cat_id=1007|archivedate=26 May 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; A leader of the Nazareth Baptist Church called for the artist to be stoned to death.&lt;ref name=AiA/&gt; The ANC also demanded that the image be taken down from the [[City Press (South Africa)|''City Press'']]' website.  ANC spokesperson Jackson Mthembu said of the painting, "The African National Congress is extremely disturbed and outraged by the distasteful and indecent manner in which Brett Murray and the Goodman Gallery in Johannesburg is displaying the person of comrade President Jacob Zuma".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ANC to go to court over Zuma painting|url=http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/Politics/ANC-to-go-to-court-over-Zuma-painting-20120517|publisher=News24.com|accessdate=19 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zuma responded to the artwork by saying that it painted him as "a philanderer and a womaniser".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Painting makes me a womaniser - Zuma|url=http://www.iol.co.za/news/politics/painting-makes-me-a-womaniser-zuma-1.1300191|accessdate=20 May 2012|newspaper=IOL.co.za|date=20 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In response to the impending legal action, gallery spokesperson Lara Koseff said its lawyers had responded that it would stay until the show was over, citing censorship concerns as central to the decision to allow the exhibition to continue.&lt;ref name="mosomane1"/&gt;  The [[African National Congress Women's League|ANC Women's League]] has also demanded that the exhibition be halted, and all instances of the image be removed from the internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Painting violates president's integrity, says ANCWL|url=http://www.timeslive.co.za/politics/2012/05/19/painting-violates-president-s-integrity-says-ancwl|accessdate=19 May 2012|newspaper=Times Live|date=19 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Stephen|first=Grootes|title=Zuma portrait saga goes to court|url=http://www.ewn.co.za/en/2012/05/19/Zuma%20portrait%20saga%20goes%20to%20court.aspx|accessdate=19 May 2012|newspaper=Eyewitness News|date=19 May 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130602173211/http://ewn.co.za/en/2012/05/19/Zuma%20portrait%20saga%20goes%20to%20court.aspx|archivedate=2 June 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brett Murray said that his painting had not been intended maliciously, but as "an attempt at humorous satire of political power and patriarchy within the context of other artworks in the exhibition and within the broader context of South African discourse".&lt;ref name=N24Defaced /&gt;

In the first day of legal proceedings, the representative for the ANC, Gcina Malindi, began sobbing and was unable to proceed, causing the process to be adjorned and postponed and the television coverage of the event was suppressed. Later, the ANC sought to drop proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Zuma lawyers tears as court hears rude painting case|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-18186692|accessdate=7 June 2012|newspaper=BBC News with video|date=24 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=ANC advocate sobs in court|url=http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/ANC-advocate-sobs-in-court-20120524|accessdate=7 June 2012|newspaper=News24|date=24 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='South Africa court hears Jacob Zuma obscene painting case|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-18182318|accessdate=7 June 2012|newspaper=BBC News|date=24 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Conway-Smith|first=Erin|title=Jacob Zuma The Spear painting case postponed indefinitely|url=http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/regions/africa/south-africa/120524/the-spear-jacob-zuma-painting-court-case-anc-lawyer|accessdate=7 June 2012|newspaper=GlobalPost|date=24 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Consequences ===
The ANC's public condemnation of the painting brought widespread local and international attention to the painting, where otherwise it may have remained a relatively obscure piece of work.  For this reason, the action and subsequent fall-out has been characterised as an example of the [[Streisand effect]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Just Hanging Out|url=http://6000.co.za/just-hanging-out/|publisher=6000 Miles from Civilization|accessdate=19 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mahere|first=Fadzayi|title=Why Zuma's Spear should stay up|url=http://www.newzimbabwe.com/opinion-8058-Why+Zumas+Spear+should+stay+up/opinion.aspx|accessdate=7 June 2012|newspaper=New Zimbabwe|date=23 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Subsequently, ''The Spear'' has been featured in editorials and news features in all forms of traditional and digital media.

Former ANC leader [[Oliver Tambo]]’s daughter Tselane Tambo was of the opinion that Zuma deserved Murray’s portrayal of him. She wrote on a social networking site, “Do the poor enjoy poverty? Do the unemployed enjoy hopelessness? Do those who can’t get housing enjoy homelessness? He must get over it. No one is having a good time. He should inspire the reverence he craves. This portrait is what he inspired. Shame neh!”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Video: Zuma’s Spear painting sabotage|url=http://www.thesouthafrican.com/news/spear-today-gone-tomorrow.htm|accessdate=7 June 2012|newspaper=The South African .com|date=22 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The media boycott of ''City Press'' by the ANC and various public figures led to the newspaper eventually removing the painting from its website on 28 May 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=de Waal|first=Mandy|title=City Press buckles to ANC demands - and threats|url=http://dailymaverick.co.za/article/2012-05-28-city-press-buckles-to-anc-demands-and-threats|accessdate=7 June 2012|newspaper=Daily Maverick|date=28 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The paper's editor-in-chief Ferial Haffajee cited several reasons for this decision, including violent threats made to her team by those supporting the boycott.{{or|date=July 2012}}

=== Media boycott ===
After ''City Press'' repeatedly refused to remove an image of the painting off their website, the ANC called upon its members and sympathisers to boycott placing advertising in, and buying of, the weekly paper.  A statement released by the ANC said: "Their refusal to remove this portrait from their website and their controlled social media is a clear indication that this newspaper does not belong to our shared democratic dispensation and values."  Responding to the boycott, ''City Press'' editor-in-chief [[Ferial Haffajee]] described Nzimande's call for a boycott of the paper as "deeply disturbing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Boycott 'immoral' ''City Press'', ANC urges|url=http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/Politics/Boycott-City-Press-the-paragon-of-immorality-ANC-20120524-2|accessdate=25 May 2012|newspaper=News24.co.za|date=25 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Defacement ==
On the morning of 22 May 2012, two men entered the gallery during visiting hours, and defaced the painting - first by painting a red cross over the depiction of Zuma's face and genitals, and then by smearing black paint over the canvas.  The two men — Barend la Grange and Lowie Mabokela&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theatlanticwire.com/global/2012/05/painting-south-african-presidents-penis-defaced/52698/ |title=Painting of South African President's Penis Defaced |author=Adam Martin |date=23 May 2012 |work=The Atlantic |accessdate=24 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; — were arrested by security officials.  This defacement took place whilst court proceedings brought on by the ANC around the right to censor the image were underway.&lt;ref name=N24Defaced&gt;{{cite news|last=Pasley-Banks|first=Carrin|title=Zuma painting defaced at Goodman Gallery|url=http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/Zuma-painting-defaced-at-Goodman-Gallery-20120522|accessdate=22 May 2012|publisher=News24|date=22 May 2012|quote=The controversial painting depicting President Jacob Zuma with his genitals exposed was defaced by two men at the Goodman Gallery in Johannesburg on Tuesday.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Zuma 'penis painting' defaced|url=http://news.iafrica.com/sa/795807.html|accessdate=22 May 2012|newspaper=iafrica.com|date=22 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparisons==
''The Spear'' portrait has invited comparison to other satirical pieces, including fellow South African artist [[Ayanda Mabulu|Ayanda Mabulu's]] work, ''{{lang|zu|Ngcono ihlwempu kunesibhanxo sesityebi}}'' (Zulu: "Better poor than a rich puppet"), which depicts various regional and international political figures - including Jacob Zuma - in the nude.  The painting received additional attention following the media focus on controversial satirical artworks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Butana|first=Kwanele|title=Cape artist despairs for ‘illiterate’ ANC|url=http://www.iol.co.za/the-star/cape-artist-despairs-for-illiterate-anc-1.1302504|publisher=iol.co.za|accessdate=25 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''ToryBoy The Movie''''' is a 2011 [[Gonzo journalism|gonzo]]-style British documentary feature film directed by and starring [[John Walsh (filmmaker)|John Walsh]]. It follows Walsh as he becomes a political candidate for the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] in the north east England constituency of [[Middlesbrough]]. 

==Background==
A staunch [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] supporter all his life, Walsh had become disillusioned with the party. When [[David Cameron]] opened the door to allow non party members to run for the Conservative candidacy ahead of the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|2010 General Election]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/conservative/5377839/David-Cameron-to-open-up-candidate-list-to-everyone.html|title=David Cameron to 'open up candidate list to everyone'|author=Chris Irvine|date=24 May 2009|work=Telegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Walsh decided to do just that and document his experiences on camera.&lt;ref name="Young People"&gt;[https://youngpeopleinpolitics.org.uk/inspiration/interviews/ John Walsh interview, Young People In Politics, n.d.&lt;/ref&gt; He came third in the election; Stuart Bell remained the MP of Middlesbrough,&lt;ref name="bbc.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-13960870|title=Tory Boy takes on Sir Stuart Bell in documentary film|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; but increased the Conservative vote to its highest in thirty years with an 18.8% share of the vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/election2010/results/constituency/c92.stm|title=BBC News - Election 2010 - Constituency - Middlesbrough|work=bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The film==
The film was based on the 72 hours of footage made by Walsh on the campaign trail.&lt;ref name="Young People"/&gt; It made the case that [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]]'s [[Stuart Bell]] should not be the [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) of [[Middlesbrough]], as Bell was absent so often from Middlesbrough that he is an unsuitable candidate. Walsh showed the finished film in a free showing a year after the election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gazettelive.co.uk/news/local-news/toryboy-movie-documentary-up-award-3691723|title=Toryboy The Movie documentary up for award|author=gazettelive Administrator|date=5 August 2011|work=gazettelive}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the ''Who Can I vote For?'' website a humorous warning is given, "this film contains strong language throughout and scenes of politicians that some viewers may find offensive".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://whocanivotefor.co.uk/person/493/john-walsh|title=John Walsh for Member of Parliament for Middlesbrough in the 2010 General Election|website=Who Can I Vote For? by Democracy Club}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mike Amesbury]] appeared in the documentary protesting outside the Conservative conference in Manchester.{{fact|date=November 2017}}

Walsh paid homage to the great title designer [[Saul Bass]] and recreated his angular animations to create a fresh approach to telling this story. “This map cap comedy best captured the visual style and the transition of the film was making from a serious expose of the political shenanigans in the North East, to a political satire.”&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thewhitebalance.com/work/toryboy-the-movie.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Walsh said that he took a risk making this film in an article with Digital Journal "For something like this, an investigative film, there will be some who think that I have exceeded my brief as a candidate. I would say that it is right to look at injustice and in this country people have died so that we may all have the right to question those in authority and those in public office."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.digitaljournal.com/blog/11509&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Northern Echo]]'' discussed the possible of the film forcing a new by election as a result of its findings. Walsh said he had been serious about becoming an MP and had self-funded his £15,000 election campaign. "When I got to Middlesbrough I found a town that politics had forgotten and a MP who was there in name only, a truly depressingly affair.”&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/news/9028657.Documentary__could_force_by_election_/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception==
The film received positive reviews, with a high score of 8.8 on [[IMDb]]&lt;ref&gt;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1740117/&lt;/ref&gt;.

In 2011 the film was nominated for the [[Grierson Awards]] for "Best Documentary on a Contemporary Theme".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.griersontrust.org/grierson-awards/past-awards/2011/the-grierson-awards-2011-shortlist/&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;http://lfs.org.uk/content/john-walshs-tory-boy-movie-shortlisted-grierson-awards&lt;/ref&gt;
The ''[[Radio Times]]'' film review by Jeremy Aspinall on the film's re-release gave it four stars, and called it "A revealing and droll fly-on-the-wall documentary. It's a fascinating odyssey illuminated by pithily informative animations. Who would have thought politics could be so entertaining?".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/film/c5xq27/toryboy-the-movie|title=Toryboy the Movie|author=Jeremy Aspinall|work=RadioTimes}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Details of the film's award nomination was covered by the Middlesbrough ''[[Teesside Gazette]]''.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gazettelive.co.uk/news/local-news/toryboy-movie-documentary-up-award-3691723&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Irish Post]]'' Walsh’s “documentary about a rookie Conservative candidate aimed to provide an insight into British political culture, and in doing so uncovered the next big political scandal.” &lt;ref&gt;http://irishpost.co.uk/documentary-that-exposed-labour-scandal-back-in-theatres-ahead-of-election/&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Richard Moss]], the [[BBC]]'s North East &amp; Cumbria Political editor, "some silliness aside, it is a thought-provoking insight into the way our political system works or doesn't work on the ground... But I'm not sure he quite nails down a case against Stuart Bell.. And John Walsh doesn't help his case with some of the content in the film."&lt;ref name="bbc.com"/&gt; [[Liberal Democratic Party|Liberal Democrat]] commentator Mark Pack wrote on his blog that "John Walsh portrays life on the campaign trail as it really is. It is a hugely enjoyable documentary, which mixes humour, drama and education".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.markpack.org.uk/29694/toryboy-john-walsh-portrays-life-on-the-campaign-trail-as-it-really-is/|title=ToryBoy: John Walsh portrays life on the campaign trail as it really is|date=1 March 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A screening at the [[Frontline Club]] took place on 22 November 2011 followed by a Q&amp;A with John Walsh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.frontlineclub.com/toryboy_visits_the_frontline_club/|title=ToryBoy visits the Frontline Club|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire Magazine]]'' gave it three stars and called it a "shit stirring exposé of local politics that will make you cross".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=510147455692929&amp;set=pb.191458757561802.-2207520000.1384175778.&amp;type=3&amp;theater screenshot at Facebook] 20 December 2012&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=November 2017}} Samuel Scott from review site DVD Compare gave it a B- and wrote "I found this documentary very intriguing and very honest. John is a very likable character, and I wouldn't hesitate in voting for someone with so much passion for a second."&lt;ref&gt;[http://dvdcompare.net/review.php?rid=3637 DVD Compare] 14 April 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Doc Geeks commented that the film was "a blunt exposé combined with a tinge of lightheartedness. Satirical animation cleverly frames Britain in its political context".&lt;ref&gt;[http://docgeeks.com/2011/11/14/review-toryboy-the-movie/ Doc Geeks] November 14th, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; On his blog, novelist [[Christopher Fowler]] wrote that ''ToryBoy The Movie'' was "a snapshot of our country’s political apathy in microcosm. It’s heartbreaking to see people blindly supporting their own demise as if they’re playing some kind of long game they’ll probably never live to see the outcome of. Oh, and it’s also very funny."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christopherfowler.co.uk/blog/2011/12/02/review-toryboy/|title=Re:View – ‘Toryboy’ - Christopher Fowler|website=www.christopherfowler.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the DVD was released Ben Kamal interviewed Walsh for the Aberdeen student newspaper ''[[Gaudie]]'', and wrote "I was prepared for some careful sneering in the interview and subsequent write-up. This did not (and could not) transpire: firstly because of the film, which comes across as [[Frank Capra]] scripted by [[Evelyn Waugh]]; secondly because of Walsh himself. He is warm, patient and generous, to my own shock I liked him and if you watch the film you'll like him too."&lt;ref&gt;[https://issuu.com/gaudie/docs/feb_25] 25 February 2014, p.6&lt;/ref&gt; "Dave", a reviewer at the website 60 Minutes With, wrote "''ToryBoy the Movie'' is a fantastic documentary and one in which you will be cheering for John despite what political party you follow. His journey from his Labour roots through to a Tory campaign is superbly documented and will have you both laughing and feeling his frustration in equal measure."&lt;ref&gt;[http://60minuteswith.co.uk/reviews/review-toryboy-movie/ 60 Minutes With], 15 November 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Northern Echo]]'' article by Lucy Richardson she reveals that “at the pre-election hustings, where Sir Stuart does not make an appearance, he tells voters that he will have Sir Stuart jailed before Christmas if elected.”&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/features/9120025.Jolt_from_the_blue/&lt;/ref&gt;

Two years after the film release, Lord [[Michael Ashcroft]] wrote on his blog: "I’d defy anyone with an interest in politics not to enjoy this film".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.conservativehome.com/platform/2012/05/lord-ashcroft-two-years-on-a-controversial-film-gives-a-witty-thought-provoking-snapshot-into-the-ge.html|title=Lord Ashcroft: Two years on, a controversial film gives a witty, thought-provoking snapshot into the general election|work=Conservative Home}}&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to say that "despite the zany tone of the film, it also has a hard-hitting message which questions whether one MP in his safe seat, and perhaps other MPs in similar situations, do enough to justify their salary and expenses."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lordashcroft.com/2012/05/two-years-on-a-controversial-film-gives-a-witty-thought-provoking-snapshot-into-the-general-election/|title=Two years on, a controversial film gives a witty, thought-provoking snapshot into the general election - Lord Ashcroft|date=6 May 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2017 the political Guido Fawkes website also known as Order Order, ran an article entitled “Inside The Greatest Election Scandal of All Time” says that Walsh “lifted the lid on the real-life world of political campaigning.”&lt;ref&gt;https://order-order.com/2017/04/28/inside-greatest-election-scandal-time/&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Vice (magazine)|Vice Mangazine]]’s Joe Zadeh’s article suggests a link between how Labour in Middlesbrough lost the votes of blue collar people and its shift to the right. He cited ToryBoy The Movie as an example of this shift.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/ev445j/how-labour-lost-the-working-class&lt;/ref&gt;

In a podcast interview with BritFlicks Walsh talks about ToryBoy and the difficulties in making the film and also his plans to develop lost [[Ray Harryhausen]] film projects.&lt;ref&gt;http://britflicks.com/blog.aspx?blogid=24084&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nerdly.co.uk/2018/01/01/interview-john-walsh-tory-boy-the-movie-ray-harryhausen-podcast/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
Although not explicitly inspired by the film, Neil Macfarlane, in a report for local newspaper''[[Teesside Gazette]]'', asked "Are Teessiders getting enough from Sir Stuart Bell?" when he failed to answer over 100 telephone calls made to his constituency office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gazettelive.co.uk/news/local-news/teessiders-getting-enough-sir-stuart-3693031|title=Are Teessiders getting enough from Sir Stuart Bell?|author=gazettelive Administrator|date=6 September 2011|work=gazettelive}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Gazette'' story was picked up by national newspapers. ''[[The Independent]]'' asked "is Sir Stuart Bell Britain's laziest MP?"&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Brown [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/no-surgeries-for-14-years--is-sir-stuart-bell-britains-laziest-mp-2350953.html No surgeries for 14 years - is Sir Stuart Bell Britain's laziest MP?], ''Independent'', 7 September 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;Richard Moss [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-14847291 Middlesbrough MP Sir Stuart Bell fights laziest MP tag], BBC, 9 September 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Guardian'' fact-checked the "laziest MP" claim and found that the laziest MP was [[Roger Godsiff]] but the report did confirm that Sir Stuart Bell did not maintain the pivotal role for a MP, an office in their constituency. &lt;ref name="reality check"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/reality-check-with-polly-curtis/2011/sep/08/reality-check-britain-s-laziest-mp|title=Reality check: Who are Britain's laziest parliamentarians?|author=Polly Curtis|work=the Guardian|date=8 September 2011}}: "Bell has been an MP for nearly 30 years and has had a distinguished career in parliament as a frontbench spokesman on trade and industry in opposition and the spokesman for the Church of England in the House of Commons and member of the House of Commons commission until last year. He's part of a breed of politicians – also including the Tory [[Edward Leigh]] and Labour's [[Gerald Kaufman]] – who have been extremely active parliamentarians but not always maintained an office in their constituency. One measure of their parliamentary work is the proportion of votes they turn up to."&lt;/ref&gt; The Labour Party said it would be totally unacceptable if constituents had been unable to contact their MP. [[Ed Miliband]] and the Labour Party expect the highest standards from Labour representatives. It is totally unacceptable if the public cannot reach their MP.&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gazettelive.co.uk/news/local-news/labour-launches-probe-middlesbrough-mp-3693109|title=Labour launches probe into Middlesbrough MP|author=gazettelive Administrator|date=8 September 2011|work=gazettelive}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Sir Stuart Bell did have a right of reply, which appeared in the short film ''ToryBoy The AfterMath''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.conservativehome.com/platform/2014/05/john-walsh-toryboy-the-aftermath-or-the-town-that-politics-forgot.html|title=John Walsh: ToryBoy – the aftermath (or: the Town That Politics Forgot…)|work=Conservative Home}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film's expose nearly forced a By Election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/news/9028657.Documentary__could_force_by_election_/|title=Documentary 'could force by-election'|work=The Northern Echo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film's re-release in 2015 caused more controversy after a showing in Middlesbrough by [[Teesside University]] was cancelled to avoid breaching union rules on political neutrality in the run up to the general election.

[[File:Porcupine tracks.png|100px|thumb|Illustration of Porcupine tracks]]
'''Tracking''' is an element of scouting that encompasses observation, stalking and the following of a trail. Unlike the form of tracking [[Tracking (hunting)|employed in hunting]], tracking within the Scouting movement tends to focus on the tracking of people as well as animals. One form of training includes the laying a [[trail]] or following a trail laid by others. A trail is made up of a series of signs, largely comprising directions, which are laid on the ground.

==History==
Tracking has been part of scouting and guiding since the beginning; it was the subject of several of [[Robert Baden-Powell|Baden-Powell]]'s [[campfire yarn]]s. In the eleventh he wrote that "One of the most important things that a Scout has to learn... is to let nothing escape his attention".{{sfn|Baden-Powell|1908|pp=103}} He suggested several methods of learning observational skills, such as [[Kim's Game]] and other memory games. Following this, in yarn twelve, he wrote about [[Spoor (animal)|spooring]], relating to the tracking of people and animals. Scouts were encouraged to identify the difference between the tracks of different animals, as well as determining the age of the tracks and the pace of movement. It was in the thirteenth yarn that Baden-Powell introduced sign based tracking, where scouts were encouraged to deduce the location of a person or animal by following signs. The purpose of training scouts in tracking skills was to encourage observation and to make it possible for them to stalk animals for observation, or hunting as food.{{sfn|Baden-Powell|1908|pp=103 - 127}}

The basic Tracking signs that all guides and scouts learn include "This way","No Entry or Danger", "Turn Left", "Turn Right", "Water Ahead", "Obstacle ahead", Split Group", Message _ paces this way" and of course "Gone home"

==Observation==
Tracking also involves interpreting the calls and movements of animals to determine whether other people are nearby.

[[File:Zhirinovsky election campaign video 2012.png|thumb|300px|[[Vladimir Zhirinovsky|Zhirinovsky]]'s own presidential election video, featuring him on a sleigh, which was harnessed with a black donkey]]
On 6 February 2012, [[Vladimir Zhirinovsky]], the far-right [[Populism|populist]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-15939801 Russia parliament elections: How the parties line up] [[BBC]]&lt;/ref&gt; leader of the nationalist [[Liberal Democratic Party of Russia]], released a 30-second election video on the Internet that featured him on a sleigh which was harnessed with a black [[donkey]]. Zhirinovsky later claimed he owned the animal and that the animal was named Proshka ({{lang-ru|link=no|Прошка}}, diminutive from Prokhor), after [[Mikhail Prokhorov]], another candidate in the [[Russian presidential election, 2012]]. The video was named "Troika" at the official site of the LDPR,&lt;ref name=LDPR-website/&gt; but was distributed on YouTube under the title: "Zhirinovsky beats donkey!".&lt;ref name=profi-forex/&gt;

In the video, Zhirinovsky claimed that the "little wretched donkey" is the symbol of [[Russia]] and that if he would become [[President of Russia|President]] a "daring [[troika harness|troika]]" would return as a [[List of cultural icons of Russia|symbol of the country]], which "got stuck" at one place just as the donkey. After this, Zhirinovsky whipped the animal to move the sleigh across the snow-covered backyard of his [[dacha]].

Animal welfare and rights organizations accused Zhirinovsky of [[cruelty to animals]] in relation to this advertisement.&lt;ref name=nr2-20120208/&gt; Zhirinovsky was also accused of disdain towards the people of Russia.&lt;ref name=narochnitskaya&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.1tv.ru/news/print/198450|script-title=ru:Выборы – 2012. Владимир Жириновский и Наталья Нарочницкая|publisher=[[Channel One (Russia)|Channel One]]|trans-title=The 2012 elections. Vladimir Zhirinovsky and Natalya Narochnitskaya|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The video became a subject of wide discussion in the [[Runet]] and the Russian media,&lt;ref name=profi-forex/&gt;&lt;ref name=RIAN-20120207/&gt; including presidential TV debates&lt;ref name=narochnitskaya/&gt; and comedy shows involving Zhirinovsky.

==Background==
[[File:Zhirinovsky Vladimir.jpg|thumb|220px|left|Zhirinovsky speaking publicly in [[Rtishchevo]] in 1999]]
Vladimir Volfovich Zhirinovsky, born in 1946, is a veteran of [[Russian politics]] who has participated in five Russian [[elections in Russia|presidential elections]].&lt;ref name=RIA-20120309/&gt; He is the founder and long-standing leader of the [[Liberal Democratic Party of Russia]]. Despite its name and its proclaimed [[centrism|centrist]] and reformist outlook, the party is frequently described as "neither liberal nor democratic."&lt;ref&gt;Timothy Colton, Yeltsin: A Life (2011), p. 282; Donald J. Raleigh, ''Soviet Baby Boomers: An Oral History of Russia's Cold War Generation'', p. 327; The troubled birth of Russian democracy: parties, personalities, and programs. p. 244.&lt;/ref&gt; It is usually regarded as far-right and is identified with Russian [[ultranationalism]], [[right-wing populism]], or national populism and conservatism.&lt;ref&gt;''Russian Political Parties Directory'' (1999), p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peter H. Merkl and Leonard Weinberg, ''Right-wing extremism in the twenty-first century'' (2003). Psychology Press: p. x.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hans-Georg Betz 1994 p. 23"&gt;Hans-Georg Betz, ''Radical right-wing populism in Western Europe'' (1994). Palgrave Macmillan: p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; Its ideology is based primarily on Zhirinovsky's ideas of "[[Imperialism|imperial]] reconquest" (a "renewed [[Russian Empire]]")&lt;ref&gt;Stephen E. Hanson, ''Post-Imperial Democracies: Ideology and Party Formation in Third Republic France, Weimar Germany, and Post-Soviet Russia'' (2011). [[Cambridge University Press]].&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] vision of a '[[Greater Russia]].'"&lt;ref name="Hans-Georg Betz 1994 p. 23"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John B. Dunlop, ''The Rise of Russia and the Fall of the Soviet Empire'' (2011). Princeton University Press, p. 167.&lt;/ref&gt;

Zhirinovsky is "often viewed as something of a [[clown]]" and "a [[showman]] of Russian politics, blending populist and nationalist rhetoric, anti-Western invective and a brash, confrontational style".&lt;ref name=bbc-20120130&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-16750990 Profiles of Russia's 2012 presidential election candidates] [[BBC]]&lt;/ref&gt; His campaign slogan for 2012 was "Vote Zhirinovsky, or things will get worse".&lt;ref name=bbc-20120130/&gt;

Eventually, in the [[Russian presidential election, 2012|2012 Russian presidential election]], Zhirinovsky was fourth with 6.22% of the votes, behind Prokhorov, who received 7.94%.&lt;ref name=RIA-20120309&gt;[http://www.ria.ru/vybor2012_infographics/20120309/590825026.html History of Presidential Elections in Russia: Infographics] [[RIAN]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content, controversy, discussions, and secondary usage==
The thirty second video was released on the Internet on 6 February 2012,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsru.com/russia/06feb2012/osel.html|script-title=ru:Воплощение идеи "Жириновский, или будет хуже": бичевание осла (ВИДЕО)|trans-title=The Implementation of the slogan "Zhirinovsky, or it will get worse": whipping a donkey (VIDEO)|publisher=newsru.com|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a part of Zhirinovsky's election campaign.&lt;ref name=LDPR-website&gt;[http://ldpr.ru/#events/videos/three The election campaign video "Тройка" ("Troika")]. Official site of the [[LDPR]].&lt;/ref&gt; The video is titled "[[troika harness|Troika]]" at the official site of the [[Liberal Democratic Party of Russia]].&lt;ref name=LDPR-website/&gt;

In the video, Zhirinovsky is seen wearing a black [[fur coat]] and a black [[ushanka]] hat, and sits in a [[sleigh]] harnessed with the black donkey. Zhirinovsky begins to speak, claiming that the "little wretched donkey is the symbol of [[Russia]]" and that if he, Zhirinovsky, would become the [[President of Russia|President]], a "daring [[troika harness|troika]]" would return as a [[List of cultural icons of Russia|symbol of Russia]]. While making the proclamation, Zhirinovsky whips the animal. As the donkey does not immediately pull, Zhirinovsky shouts "It cannot move.... The whole country got stuck...." and continually shouts "Go! Go! Go!" while furiously whipping the animal into moving across the snow-covered backyard of his [[dacha]]. A [[voice-over]] concludes the video: "Zhirinovsky – it will get better!"&lt;ref name=LDPR-website/&gt;

The video was widely discussed on the Internet.&lt;ref name=RIAN-20120207&gt;[http://en.rian.ru/russia/20120207/171195718.html ''Zhirinovsky Explains why He Swatted Ass''] [[RIAN]] 7 February 2012&lt;/ref&gt; It received mostly negative reactions from Russian users.&lt;ref name=profi-forex&gt;{{cite web|last=Шалимова|first=Мария|script-title=ru:В сети представлен ролик "Жириновский и будет лучше!"|language=Russian|trans-title="Zhirinovsky And It Will Get Better" advertisement appears on the web|url=http://www.profi-forex.org/news/entry1008104857.html|publisher=profi-forex.org|accessdate=5 April 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130415150403/http://www.profi-forex.org/news/entry1008104857.html|archivedate=15 April 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The video also featured on [[Channel One (Russia)|Channel One]]'s comedy show ''Yesterday Live'' on 17 March 2012, as part of a spoof news clip from a fictitious [[Television in the United States|US-based TV channel]], reporting that, in Russia, there was a shortage of gasoline, with people abandoning cars and resorting to other modes of transportation.&lt;ref name=1TV-20120317&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.1tv.ru/sprojects_edition/si5808/fi14207|title=Yesterday Live: Выпуск от 17 марта|trans-title=Yesterday Live: 17 March|language=Russian|publisher=[[Channel One (Russia)|Channel One]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Symbolism==
[[File:Troika akron.jpg|thumb|250px|A [[troika harness|troika]], a traditional [[Russia]]n icon which Zhirinovsky has controversially replaced with a donkey in his video.]]

Zhirinovsky explained the meaning of his video on television, saying: "I’d like to explain that many of our citizens are suffering about the past greatness of [[Russia]], i.e., the [[Russian Empire]], the [[Soviet Union]]. Today, there is no greatness. And with this clip in 30 seconds I wanted to show that today it is not the famous [[troika harness|troika]] that [once] galloped [...] Today it is a donkey. That is the thing. Today they smacked down our country, economy, culture, and the Russian language [...] We don’t want this weak animal to be the symbol of Russia."&lt;ref name=RIAN-20120207/&gt; Zhirinovsky referred to an explanation of the origin of troika in a televised election debate with [[Natalya Narochnitskaya]].&lt;ref name=narochnitskaya/&gt; The Troika has become a [[List of cultural icons of Russia|cultural icon of Russia]], especially after it was featured in a scene of [[Nikolay Gogol]]'s novel ''[[Dead Souls]]'', where a "troika-bird" rides through the vast expanses of Russia.&lt;ref name=troika-translation&gt;Translation taken from the "[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/1081/1081-h/1081-h.htm Dead Souls]" by [[Nikolai Gogol]]. Gutenberg.org&lt;/ref&gt;  Narochnitskaya accused Zhirinovsky of disdain towards the people of Russia, as well as projecting [[pessimism]] and [[aggression]] through this video.&lt;ref name=narochnitskaya/&gt;&lt;ref name=1tv-20120207&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.km.ru/v-rossii/2012/02/08/vybory-2011-2012/zhirinovskii-otvetil-za-osla|script-title=ru:Жириновский ответил за осла (ВИДЕО)|trans-title=Zhirinovsky takes account for the donkey (VIDEO)|language=Russian|publisher=km.ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zhirinovsky replied that the video is an [[allegory]] of what the [[rulers of Russia]] had made with the country in the last hundred years.&lt;ref name=narochnitskaya/&gt;&lt;ref name=1tv-20120207/&gt;

===Naming of the donkey===
Zhirinovsky stated during a televised election debate with [[Gennady Zyuganov]], another presidential candidate, that the animal seen in the video is called Proshka.&lt;ref name=kommersant&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kommersant.ru/doc/1872571/print|script-title=ru:ТВ не место для дебатов|trans-title=TV is not a place for debates|language=Russian|publisher=[[Kommersant]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proshka is the [[diminutive]] form of the [[Greek names|Greek]] and [[Slavic names|Slavic]] name [[Prokhor]]; Zhirinovsky stated that the animal is named after Russian presidential candidate, [[Mikhail Prokhorov]].&lt;ref name=vokrug-201202026&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vokrug.tv/article/show/vredina_33677/|script-title=ru:Владимир Жириновский рассказал про осла Прошку|language=Russian|trans-title=Vladimir Zhirinovsky told about Proshka the donkey|publisher=vokrug.tv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later Zhirinovsky confirmed the donkey's name as "Proshka, Prokhor" when he participated as a guest in the comedy talk show [[Prozhektorperiskhilton]] on [[Channel One (Russia)|Channel One]] TV.&lt;ref name=vokrug-201202026/&gt;

This incident did not mark the first time Zhirinovsky named a domestic animal after a rival politician. In the same Prozhektorperiskhilton show, Zhirinovsky also said that he once owned a male sheep called "Ben", which was named after the initials of Russian politician, [[Boris Efimovich Nemtsov]], another political opponent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/667745.stm Zhirinovsky: Russia's political eccentric] [[BBC]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Allegations of animal cruelty==
According to Zhirinovsky, the animal featured in the video was his own – a present given to him on his 60th birthday. He said that it is kept on his [[dacha]] land, and has not been used for any work for the last five years. The animal is claimed by Zhirinovsky to be well-fed, to have separate lodgings, and to live in conditions found "nowhere in the world".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.regnum.ru/news/polit/1496769.html|script-title=ru:Жириновский признался, что любит животных|language=Russian|trans-title=Zhirinovsky confessed that he loves animals|publisher=regnum.ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

International organizations [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals]] (PETA) and [[World Society for the Protection of Animals]] (Now known as [[World Animal Protection]]), as well as Russian animal rights activists, have accused Zhirinovsky of [[cruelty to animals]]. Zhirinovsky responded to criticism, saying that similar treatment is commonplace in the [[Arab world]], and that in fact, the animal has been treated "better than many people".&lt;ref name=nr2-20120208&gt;{{cite web|url=https://newdaynews.ru/election/371706.html|language=Russian|title=WSPA и PETA обвинили Жириновского в жестоком обращении с ослом|trans-title==WSPA and PETA accused Zhirinovsky in crueltu to the donkey|publisher=NewDayNews.Ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Central Electoral Commission of Russia]] commented that there is no regulation on whether and how presidential candidates could use animals in propaganda, but that if the candidates do so, they should take all the risks connected with that.&lt;ref name=nr2-20120208/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2274">{{Refimprove|date=June 2011}}'''Yasumasa Hirai''' (平井保昌) is a [[fictional character]] from the historical fantasy novel ''[[Teito Monogatari]]'' by [[Hiroshi Aramata]].  He also appears in the prequel novel ''[[Teito Monogatari|Teito Gendan]]''

Hirai is the direct descendant of [[Abe no Seimei]] and a master [[Onmyoji]]. He leads the [[Tsuchimikado|Tsuchimikado Clan]], one of the last royal families of Japan that practiced [[Onmyōdō]].  He also serves as a spiritual adviser to the [[Emperor Meiji|Emperor]] in [[Kyoto]].

==Significance==
In classic depictions of [[Abe no Seimei]] in art and literature, Seimei is usually portrayed as a wise, crafty elderly gentleman with powerful supernatural abilities.  Hirai, being Seimei's descendants, is modeled off this image. Furthermore, his actions in the story are modeled off the actions of Seimei in classic stories from the ''[[Uji Shui Monogatari]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Reider, Noriko T.
