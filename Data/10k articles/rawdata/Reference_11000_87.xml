'''''A Guide to Grand-Jury Men''''' — in full, '''''A Guide to Grand Jury Men, Divided in two books. In the first, is the Author’s best advice to them what to do, before they bring in a Billa vera in cases of Witchcraft, with a Christian Direction to such as are too much given upon every cross to think themselves bewitched. In the Second, is a Treatise touching Witches good and bad, how they may be known, evicted, condemned, with many particulars tending thereunto''''' was first published in 1627 and written by a [[puritan]] clergyman named [[Richard Bernard]]. The work is a collection of two dissertations on the legal aspects of [[witchcraft]] and how those participating in the trials may be deceived by deceit and counterfeited accounts but further elaborates on how many natural ills can be taken as bewitchment. Bernard gives advice on how to determine an actual account of witchcraft from that of a false accusation and even more, the signs one should seek to determine if a man is truly bewitched or suffering from a natural sickness. The dissertation was written to help reform the laws on witchcraft and also to educate the men commissioned to seek out, investigate and prosecute instances of witchcraft, and as a guide to witchfinding with a combination of scientific analysis and theological understanding that was not previously used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bernard|first1=Richard|title=A Guide to Grand-Jury Men: In Modern English|isbn=1542697077}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously, the Justices of Peace did not always expect direct evidence, and seeing that the works of witched were works of darkness, there were often no witnesses present with them to accuse them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Observations for the discovery of Witches.|date=1645}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Book One==
The first book covers a wide range of topics but focuses on some key points. The first is the scientific aspect to witchcraft; that strange diseases can happen to both men and animals that are neither inflicted by devils or witches.&lt;ref group="A"&gt;p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; There were many who were falsely accused of witchcraft based on their natural ailments, but it was Richard Bernard's belief that men were also able to counterfeit various claims of bewitchment for their own financial, social or political purpose&lt;ref group="A"&gt;p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;  and that if the devil were involved, he could work without the consent or association of a witch. &lt;ref group="A"&gt;p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Book Two==
The second book delves into the study of [[demonology]] and the theology of witchcraft, and works to prove through theological study what witches are real &lt;ref group="A"&gt;p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; and how a witch is said to enlist a spirit to conduct mischief and bewitch others.&lt;ref group="A"&gt;p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt; Bernard explains the behavioral characteristics of an individual most likely to become a witch&lt;ref group="A"&gt;p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt; and how the Devil solicits an individual and prepares them to partake in the practices of witchcraft and deceit. &lt;ref group="A"&gt;p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt; Bernard felt that a person who goes to a witch, wizard, or blesser for assistance is just as guilty of witchcraft in the biblical perspective.&lt;ref group="A"&gt;p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt; There are also elaborations on the following topics:
* The sealing and confirmation of a [[Contract with the devil]] and the various kinds of individuals that may establish such a pact
* The shapes and appearances which [[Satan]] may take
* How a Christian may be overtaken and yielded by witchcraft
* The differences between a good witch and a bad witch
* The various occupations a witch may take
* That many rituals and preparations must be made before anything can be bewitched
* The manner and methods of examining a witch
* The difficulties in discovering a witch and the causes of those difficulties
* The political reasons for executing witches
* How trials of bad witches should be conducted and rules for the persecution, conviction and condemnation of witches in the course of justice.

'''Agatha Christie''' (1890–1976) was an English crime novelist, short-story writer and playwright. Although she wrote six romance novels under the pseudonym Mary Westmacott, her reputation rests on the 66 detective novels and 14 short-story collections that she wrote under her own name, which have sold over two billion copies—an amount only surpassed by the Bible and the works of [[William Shakespeare]].&lt;ref name="Gage CA" /&gt; Her works contain several regular characters with whom the public became familiar, including [[Hercule Poirot]], [[Miss Marple]], [[Tommy and Tuppence|Tommy and Tuppence Beresford]], [[Parker Pyne]] and [[Harley Quin]].{{sfn|Morgan|2015}}&lt;ref name="Gage CA" /&gt; Christie wrote more Poirot stories than any of the others, even though she thought the character to be "rather insufferable".{{sfn|Morgan|2015}} Following the publication of the 1975 novel ''[[Curtain (novel)|Curtain]]'', Poirot's obituary appeared on the front page of ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;ref name="AC Poirot" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT Obit" /&gt; The literary historian Howard Haycraft considered that "few fictional sleuths can surpass the amazing little Belgian—with his waxed moustache and egg-shaped head, his inflated confidence in the infallibility of his 'little grey cells', his murderous attacks on the English language—either for individuality or ingenuity."{{sfn|Haycraft|1941|p=131}}

Christie was born into a wealthy upper-middle-class family in Ashfield, [[Torquay]], [[Devon]]. She met her future husband just before the First World War;{{efn|Christie was married twice. She married Archibald Christie in December 1914 but the couple were in divorced in 1928; she then married the archaeologist [[Max Mallowan]] and the relationship lasted until Christie's death.{{sfn|Morgan|2015}}}} after he was sent to the Western Front, she worked with the [[Voluntary Aid Detachment]], and in the chemist dispensary, giving her a working background knowledge of medicines and poisons.{{sfn|Morgan|2015}} Christie's writing career began during the war after she was challenged by her sister to write a detective story; she produced ''[[The Mysterious Affair at Styles]]'', which was turned down by two publishers before it was eventually published in 1920.{{sfn|Morgan|2015}}{{sfn|Engelhardt|2011|p=83}} Following the limited success of the novel, she continued to write and steadily built up a fan base for what ''[[Contemporary Authors]]'' calls "her unfailingly clever plots".&lt;ref name="Gage CA" /&gt; She went on to write over a hundred works, including further novels, short stories, plays, poetry, and two autobiographies. Aside from works under her own name, she wrote six romantic novels under the pseudonym Mary Westmacott.{{sfn|Hall|1984|p=6}} 

One of Christie's plays, ''[[The Mousetrap]]'', opened in [[West End of London|West End theatre]] in 1952 and, as at March 2018, was still running; in 2009 the London run exceeded 25,000 performances.&lt;ref name=mousetrap /&gt; In September 2015 a public vote identified ''[[And Then There Were None]]''—originally published in 1939 under the name ''Ten Little Niggers''—as the public's favourite Christie novel; the book was the writer's favourite, and the one she found most difficult to write.&lt;ref name="None favourite" /&gt;

In September 1930 Christie married the archaeologist [[Max Mallowan]], whom she met when she visited the excavations at [[Ur]] in [[Mesopotamia]]. The pair travelled frequently on expeditions, where Christie would help with the finds, and she used the experiences as a basis for her plots, including ''[[Murder on the Orient Express]]'' (1934), ''[[Murder in Mesopotamia]]'' (1936) and ''[[Death on the Nile]]'' (1937). She also wrote the autobiographical travel book ''[[Come, Tell Me How You Live]]'' (1946), which described their life in Syria; her biographer, [[Janet Morgan, Lady Balfour of Burleigh|Janet Morgan]], reports that "archaeologists have celebrated&amp;nbsp;... [Christie's] contribution to Near Eastern exploration".{{sfn|Morgan|2015}} Christie died in January 1976, her reputation as a crime novelist high.{{sfn|Hall|1984|p=5}} Her biographer, [[H. R. F. Keating]], describes Christie as "a towering figure in the history of crime literature",{{sfn|Keating|1988|p=71}} while her obituarist in ''[[The Times]]'' considers that, following the death of [[Dorothy L. Sayers]] in 1957, Christie was "the undoubted queen of her profession".&lt;ref name="Times: Obit" /&gt;

A total of 165 stories have been written and published in 15 collections in the US and the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Agatha Christie reading order with dates| url=http://uk.agathachristie.com/attachments/assets/Reading_order_with_dates.pdf| publisher=Agatha Christie Official UK Site| accessdate=23 September 2013| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110919221400/http://uk.agathachristie.com/attachments/assets/Reading_order_with_dates.pdf| archivedate=19 September 2011| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; 164 stories were published in the UK with the omission of "Three Blind Mice". The original short stories that were used for [[The Big Four (novel)|''The Big Four'']] were published in 2017. 152 stories were published in the US with the omission of "Christmas Adventure", which was the original version of "The Adventure of the Christmas Pudding". Some stories were published under different names in the US Collections.

Four short stories, "The Submarine Plans", "Christmas Adventure", "The Mystery of the Baghdad Chest" and "The Second Gong", were expanded into longer stories by Christie (respectively "The Incredible Theft", "The Adventure of the Christmas Pudding", "The Mystery of the Spanish Chest" and "Dead Man's Mirror"). All four of the original versions were published in the UK, and three of them were published in the US (with "Christmas Adventure" being the exception).

The play was unperformed until 2006. Based on the 1925 novel ''[[The Secret of Chimneys]]''.

[[Image:1896-Andrees-3rd.jpg|thumb|200px|Cover of the third edition of ''Andrees Allgemeiner Handatlas'', 1896.]]

'''''Andrees Allgemeiner Handatlas''''' was a major cartographic work (general atlas) published in several German and foreign editions 1881–1937. It was named after [[Richard Andree]] (1835–1912) and published by Velhagen &amp; Klasing, [[Bielefeld]] and [[Leipzig]], Germany.

By using [[chromolithography]], rather than copper plate [[engraving]], but reproducing the maps from zinc plates that were etched in [[relief print|relief]] (just like [[letterpress printing]]), V &amp; K was able to offer detailed maps at a much lower price than competing works, such as the 7th and 8th editions of [[Stielers Handatlas]]. The 1937 edition of ''Andrees Handatlas'' was printed using [[offset printing]].

==Editions==
The first edition appeared in 1881.&lt;ref name="pp1"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Espenhorst|first1=Jürgen|title=Petermann's Planet, vol. 1|date=2003|publisher=Pangaea Verlag|isbn=978-3-930401-35-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|567}} The 4th and 5th editions were edited by Carl Paul Albert (1851-1912);&lt;ref name="pp1" /&gt;{{rp|568–569}} the 6th through 8th editions, by Ernst Ambrosius;&lt;ref name="pp1" /&gt;{{rp|569–570}} and the final edition, by Konrad Frenzel. Cartographers were G. Jungk (†1932), R. Kocher, E. Umbreit (†1904), T. Adolph (†1930), H. Mielisch (†1925), and K. Tänzler (†1944)&lt;ref name="pp1" /&gt;{{rp|586}} although production of a number of maps was contracted out to geographical institutes like Peip, Wagner &amp; Debes, Sternkopf, Sulzer.

'''ArenaPAL''' is a UK company, based in [[Edenbridge, Kent]], which specialises in the licensing of performing arts images, both in the UK and throughout the world.  Its collection falls under the main categories of [[opera]], [[theatre]], [[classical music|classical]] and [[contemporary music]], [[classical dance|classical]] and [[contemporary dance]], as well as educational imagery covering all categories.

It manages a library of 10 million images with over 700,000 currently viewable online. The library also holds thousands of unscanned prints, negatives and transparencies. These are digitised as part of its on-site archival scanning project. In 2007, it was declared the best international image library in the world.

== History ==
[[File:Arenapalwebsitex.jpg|thumb|245px|The Arenapal website serves as a portal to the company's primary search facility and distribution outlet]]
ArenaPAL was founded in 1997 as the first fully digitised performing arts archive. Unlike most specialist photographic agencies, it has worked with a wide range of contributors from its inception. The company continues to expand its extensive archive as well as taking in submissions of contemporary performance, including theatre, ballet, dance and opera productions, plus classical music, rock, pop and jazz events.

ArenaPAL is also a photographic commissions agency with a roster of arts photographers including [[Clive Barda]], Richard Cannon, Eric Richmond and Hilary Shedel. ArenaPAL is a member of the [[British Association of Picture Libraries and Agencies]] (BAPLA), which has declared it: "[t]he best international performing arts photographic resource for all images users representing a unique collection from around the world", in 2007.&lt;ref name="BAPLAquote"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110719121221/http://www.bapla.org.uk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=47&amp;Itemid=90&amp;favm=33%2F ArenaPAL] British Association of Picture Libraries and Agencies (BAPLA).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12052">The British [[Bradshaw's Guide]] was an early compiled timetable, including all known public railways in [[Great Britain]].  The Wikipedia [[Bradshaw's Guide]] page also lists a number of other countries that issued compiled timetables, borrowing the Bradshaw name from the British model: France, Germany and Austria, India, Italy, Syria and Turkey.  In [[Australia]] two Bradshaw's were issued: the short-lived Bradshaw's New South Wales postal &amp; road guide&lt;ref&gt;[http://trohttp://cdnb.austta.org.au/thetimes200305issue.pdfve.nla.gov.au/work/22034759?selectedversion=NBD9358923] {{dead link|date=August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was published for a short time in the 1870s and, possibly, a little earlier; and '''Bradshaw's Guide to Victoria''', which had an 86-year life, from 1856&lt;ref name="nla.gov.au"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/version/26953404|title=Bradshaw's guide to Victoria|date=6 August 2017|publisher=Melbourne : Wilson, Mackinnon and Fairfax|via=Trove}}&lt;/ref&gt; to 1942.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cdnb.austta.org.au/thetimes200305issue.pdf|format=PDF|title=Tracing the tracks of Maldon’s AEC|website=Cdnb.austta.org.au|accessdate=2017-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Bradshaw’s Railway and General Guide to Victoria was first published in May 1856.  It appropriated the name of the famed British Bradshaw’s Railway Guide. It was first published less than two years after the opening of Victoria's (and Australia's) [[Rail transport in Australia|first railway]] from [[Melbourne]] to [[Port Melbourne, Victoria|Sandridge]],&lt;ref&gt;The definition of what constitutes a ''railway'' varies and, thus, so does the question of what was Australia's first railway.  However, a ''railway'' is most commonly defined as a series of vehicles being hauled on a track by an engine, and by that definition, the Melbourne-Sandridge line is most commonly regarded as Australia's first railway.&lt;/ref&gt; but a number of other railways were in the course of construction, and the timetables were included as soon as the particular line opened.  Nevertheless, the early editions of Bradshaw's contained numerous coach timetables and other miscellaneous material.

July 1859 is an example of an early issue;&lt;ref&gt;in the collection of the National Library of Australia, Canberra&lt;/ref&gt; a time when Melbourne's railways were at an embryonic stage. The privately-owned  [[Melbourne and Hobson's Bay Railway Company]], the [[Melbourne and Suburban Railway Company]], and the [[Geelong and Melbourne Railway Company]] were all operating, and the government-owned [[Victorian Railways]] had just built their first lines to [[Williamstown railway line|Williamstown]] and [[Sunbury railway line|Sunbury]].  Railway information only occupied eight of the 124 pages.  The remainder of the Guide provided comprehensive detail of all manner of institutions in what was a very fast-growing colony, mainly because of the [[Victorian gold rush]].  Information is given about the Parliament, Government, courts, municipal councils, the electric telegraph, banks, insurance companies, churches, [[Masonic]] lodges, postal charges and arrangements, and country localities. There were also a number of advertisements.  The printing is of a high standard for the times.

The [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]n Bradshaw was published monthly and was available from newsagents throughout the state. In latter years, the railway timetable section was based on information supplied by Victorian Railways but sometimes the information was a little behind that in the V.R.s own public timetables, usually published twice-yearly, and available from train stations across the state.  However, as we've already seen, Bradshaw's provided much more than railway timetables. The November 1936 edition &lt;ref&gt;in the collection of Albert Isaacs, Melbourne&lt;/ref&gt; also contained: cab fares; calendars; information on cities, towns, boroughs, shires, including population; a comprehensive [[Commonwealth of Australia]] section; list of [[consuls]]; directions for making a [[will and testament|will]]; fish, minimum lengths of; [[gardening]] notes; a comprehensive [[Government of Victoria]] section; a post office and [[telegraphy|telegraph]] section, including rates; railway [[cloak room]] rates, fares, parcels rates, etc.; [[stamp duty|stamp duties]]; standard time; tides at [[Williamstown, Victoria|Williamstown]]; a comprehensive [[Trams in Melbourne|tramway]] section covering government and private tramways, cable and electric; voter's qualifications.

By 1890 the layout of Bradshaw's Guide to Victoria was basically as it was in 1936 (see above) and it retained a similar layout until it ceased publication in 1942.  By 1890 about 70% of Bradshaw was railway timetables, about 25% Postal arrangements, and the balance a miscellaneous collection of sometimes odd information about Victoria (as listed above).

When Bradshaw's Guide to Victoria commenced publication, its railway section was a compiled timetable covering the services of all Victorian railways, public and privately owned.  In that respect it was similar to other Bradshaw's Guide around the world.  However, within a few decades, the [[Victorian Railways]] had taken over the vast majority of railways in the state, and by the 1920s the shire-owned [[Kerang-Koondrook Tramway]] was the only privately owned railway in Victoria.  Its timetable was published by Bradshaw, and although it wasn't a V.R. line, its services were also shown in V.R. timetables.

Until December 1896 Bradshaw's was published by Wilson, Mackinnon and Fairfax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.obj-231463689/view|title=Bradshaw's Map of Melbourne [cartographic material] : Collingwood, Richmond, Prahran, Windsor, Emerald Hill, Sandridge, &amp;c.|website=Nla.gov.au|accessdate=2017-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Much of the artwork was provided by engraver Fredrick Grosse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/grosse-frederick-12955|title=Australian Dictionary of Biography|first=Peter A.|last=Dowling|publisher=National Centre of Biography, Australian National University|via=Australian Dictionary of Biography}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.obj-231464453|title=Bradshaw's Map of Melbourne &amp; suburbs [cartographic material] : showing the churches, public institutions, railways, &amp;c. / drawn by Blackburn ; engd. by F. Grosse|first1=|last1=Bradshaw (Firm)|first2=Frederick|last2=Grosse|first3=|last3=Blackburn|publisher=[Bradshaw?], Office-78, Collins St. East, next door above "The Argus" Office|via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; From January 1897 and until the last edition, the publishing and printing of Bradshaw's was in the hands of Mr Bill Stillwell who, at various stages operated as Stillwell &amp; Knight,&lt;ref name="nla.gov.au"/&gt; Stillwell &amp; Stephens. Stillwell &amp; Co.&lt;ref&gt;all names are clearly shown on various editions&lt;/ref&gt;

As the Victorian Railways grew, the size of Bradshaw’s did not increase.  Rather, information other than that for the railways and postal services was dropped.  The other striking characteristic of Bradshaw’s Guide to Victoria over the years was that the quality of the printing and layout did not improve - it deteriorated.  By the late nineteenth century, Bradshaw’s had a poor appearance.

Unlike V.R. timetables which showed the various tables in geographical order, Bradshaw's was geographically erratic.  Smaller tables were placed under larger ones where there was an appropriate space and there was no attempt at any order. Generally, mainlines appeared at the beginning, but then logic disappears.  Branch lines appeared in random order, with no regard to geography.  Country and suburban tables are mixed up.  Sometimes the printing went right up to the edge of the page, and sometimes even a small portion of a table was missing.

==Closure==
Bradshaw's Guide to Victoria ceased publication in August 1942.

In latter years the V.R. appeared to perceive Bradshaw's as competition to their own public timetables and were therefore reluctant to hand over timetable changes to Bradshaw's, and when they did it was usually after the same information had appeared in their own publications.  This is strongly believed to be the main reason for Stillwell &amp; Co stopping production.

In its final years, 1940–42, the overwhelming impression is of a poor, cheaply produced publication.  One of the first items in these editions is a list of consuls accredited in Victoria.  This still listed the consuls for [[Germany]], [[Japan]], [[Austria]], [[Czechoslovakia]] and other countries with which Australia had either been at [[World War II|war]] for a number of years or whose country had disappeared even earlier in the lead-up to war!  Indeed, the impression is that the publishers really didn’t care any more.  The arrangement of the timetables is even more higgledy-piggledy than before; they are in no particular order as to geography and country and suburban tables are still mixed up together.  Some suburban lines have services on different days appearing in different parts of the book.  Some railway timetables are placed, for no apparent reason, well away from the rest of the railway section; after the postal information.

Nevertheless, a study of the railway timetables over these last three years shows that attempts were made to keep these tables up-to-date.  The timetables show, in general, a decline in the standard of VR passenger service as war priorities took hold.

In 1940 the [[trams in Melbourne|tramway]] summary timetables still reflected the separate pre-1920 suburban [[trams in Melbourne|Tramway Trusts]]!  However, between 1940 and 1941, the publisher did take the trouble to redesign the tramway summary timetables.  On the other hand, between 1941 and 1942, the railway country and metropolitan foldout maps disappeared.  Presumably this was a cost-saving measure.

The non-railway and non-postal information that survived to this period was a very odd mixture: lists of Federal and State Members of Parliament, consuls in Victoria, gardening notes (presumably recycled each year), and Victorian game hunting laws.

The final Bradshaw’s Guide to Victoria was published in August 1942. There was a large print run of the last edition, and it was available from many newsagents for some years after it was published. In December 1941, the Victorian Railways had published their last public timetable, primarily because of staff shortages caused by [[World War II]] but also continuing into the post-war period. There was not another VR timetable until 1954.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.victorianrailways.net/vr%20history/history.html|title=VR timeline.|website=Victorianrailways.net|accessdate=2017-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the last edition of Bradshaw's, albeit out of date, was the only thing that the public had to refer to.  Within nine months Victoria went from having two regular Railway public timetables to none.

Despite its disreputable and off-putting appearance Bradshaw’s Guide to Victoria is a valuable source of historical timetable information.  The railway information was usually kept up-to-date, even when the rest of the information was not.  However, for the best information, it is of course preferable to go the official Victorian Railways timetables, but Bradshaw’s is still useful: firstly, its more frequent publication gave greater topicality; and secondly, it is more widely available in reference libraries than VR timetables.

'''Carol Jarecki''' (born 1935) is an American [[chess]] organizer, an [[International Arbiter]], and a chess writer.  

== Biography ==
Jarecki earned her pilot licenses while living in Heidelberg, Germany. She first became involved with chess as a "ChessMom", flying her young son, John Jarecki, who became the youngest ever [[chess master]] in U.S. history at the age of 12 in 1981 (the record was soon surpassed by a slightly younger [[Stuart Rachels]]), to various chess events in the United States.&lt;ref name="Schulz2016"&gt;{{cite book|author=Andre Schulz|title=The Big Book of World Chess Championships: 46 Title Fights - from Steinitz to Carlsen|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4NUlDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=RA2-PT381|date=11 May 2016|publisher=New in Chess|isbn=978-90-5691-636-7|pages=2–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon, she started working at those tournaments and eventually became a certified tournament director at the highest National Tournament Director level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://uschesschamps.com/2017-us-championships/arbiters/carol-jarecki|title=Carol Jarecki - www.uschesschamps.com|website=uschesschamps.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has continued directing, although her son is no longer an active player. 

She has directed many prestigious chess events including serving as Head Tournament Director at several [[U.S. Chess Championship]]s, SuperNational Scholastic Championships, National Elementary Championships, and World Opens in [[Philadelphia]] as well as many other national tournaments large and small.

In [[library and information science]], '''cataloging''' (or '''cataloguing''') is the process of creating [[metadata]] representing information [[resource]]s, such as books, sound recordings, moving images, etc. Cataloging provides information such as creator names, titles, and subject terms that describe resources, typically through the creation of [[bibliographic record]]s. The records serve as surrogates for the stored information resources. Since the 1970s these metadata are in [[machine-readable form]] and are indexed by information retrieval tools, such as [[bibliographic database]]s or [[search engine]]s. While typically the cataloging process results in the production of [[library catalog]]s, it also produces other types of discovery tools for [[document]]s and collections.

'''Bibliographic control''' provides the philosophical basis of cataloging, defining the rules for sufficiently describing information resources to enable users to find and select the most appropriate resource.  A '''cataloger''' is an individual responsible for the processes of description, subject analysis, classification, and [[authority control]] of library materials. Catalogers serve as the "foundation of all library service, as they are the ones who organize information in such a way as to make it easily accessible".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bair|first=Sheila|title=Toward a Code of Ethics for Cataloging|journal=Technical Services Quarterly|date=13 September 2005|volume=23|issue=1|page=14|doi=10.1300/J124v23n01_02}}&lt;!--|accessdate=31 May 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

== Six functions of bibliographic control ==
Ronald Hagler identified six functions of bibliographic control.&lt;ref&gt;Hagler, Ronald (1997).  ''The Bibliographic Record and Information Technology'', 3rd ed. Chicago: American Library Association.&lt;/ref&gt;
*"Identifying the existence of all types of information resources as they are made available."&lt;ref name=Taylorpg5&gt;Taylor, Arlene G., &amp; Daniel N. Joudrey (2009). ''The organization of information''. 3rd ed. Englewood: Libraries Unlimited, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;  The existence and identity of an information resource must be known before it can be found. 
*"Identifying the works contained within those information resources or as parts of them."&lt;ref name=Taylorpg5 /&gt; Depending on the level of granularity required, multiple works may be contained in a single package, or one work may span multiple packages.  For example, is a single photo considered an information resource?  Or can a collection of photos be considered an information resource?
*"Systematically pulling together these information resources into collections in libraries, [[archive]]s, [[museums]], and Internet communication files, and other such depositories."&lt;ref name=Taylorpg5 /&gt;  Essentially, acquiring these items into collections so that they can be of use to the user.
*"Producing lists of these information resources prepared according to standard rules for citation."&lt;ref name=Taylorpg6&gt;Taylor and Joudrey, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;  Examples of such retrieval aids include library catalogue, indexes, archival [[finding aids]], etc.
*"Providing name, title, subject, and other useful access to these information resources."&lt;ref name=Taylorpg6 /&gt;  Ideally, there should be many ways to find an item so there should be multiple access points. There must be enough [[metadata]] in the surrogate record so users can successfully find the information resource they are looking for. These access points should be consistent, which can be achieved through [[authority control]].  
*"Providing the means of locating each information resource or a copy of it."&lt;ref&gt;Taylor and Joudrey, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;  In libraries, the [[online public access catalogue]] (OPAC) can give the user location information (a [[Library classification|call number]] for example) and indicate whether the item is available.

== History of bibliographic control ==
While the organization of information has been going on since antiquity, bibliographic control as we know it today is a more recent invention.  Ancient civilizations recorded lists of books onto tablets and libraries in the [[Middle Ages]] kept records of their holdings.  With the invention of the printing press in the 15th century, multiple copies of a single book could be produced quickly.  [[Johann Tritheim]], a German librarian, was the first to create a bibliography in chronological order with an alphabetical author index.  [[Konrad Gesner]] followed in his footsteps in the next century as he published an author bibliography and subject index.  He added to his bibliography an alphabetical list of authors with inverted names, which was a new practice.  He also included references to variant spellings of author's names, a precursor to authority control.  [[Andrew Maunsell]] further revolutionized bibliographic control by suggesting that a book should be findable based on the author's last name, the subject of the book, and the translator.  In the 17th century [[Thomas Bodley|Sir Thomas Bodley]] was interested in a catalog arranged alphabetically by author's last name as well as subject entries.  In 1697, [[Frederic Rostgaard]] called for subject arrangement that was subdivided by both chronology and by size (whereas in the past titles were arranged by their size only), as well as an index of subjects and authors by last name and for word order in titles to be preserved based on the title page.&lt;ref&gt;Strout, Ruth French (1956).  "The Development of the Catalog and Cataloging Codes." ''Library Quarterly 26''(4): 254-275&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[French Revolution]], France's government was the first to put out a national code containing instructions for cataloging library collections.&lt;ref&gt;Smalley, Joseph (1991).  "The French Cataloging Code of 1791: A Translation." ''Library Quarterly 61''(1): 1-14.&lt;/ref&gt;  At the British Museum Library [[Anthony Panizzi]] created his "Ninety-One Cataloging Rules" (1841), which essentially served as the basis for cataloging rules of the 19th and 20th centuries.  [[Charles Coffin Jewett|Charles C. Jewett]] applied Panizzi's "91 Rules" at the [[Smithsonian Institution]].

==Types of cataloging==

===Descriptive cataloging===
"Descriptive cataloging" is a well-established concept in the tradition of library cataloging in which a distinction is made between descriptive cataloging and subject cataloging, each applying a set of standards, different qualifications and often also different kinds of professionals. In the tradition of documentation and information science (e.g., by commercial bibliographical databases) the concept document representation (also as verb: document representing) have mostly been used to cover both "descriptive" and "subject" representation. Descriptive cataloging has been defined as "the part of cataloging concerned with describing the physical details of a book, such as the form and choice of entries and the title page transcription."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Trustees' Glossary|url=http://www.odl.state.ok.us/servlibs/l-files/glossd.htm|publisher=Office of Library Development, the Oklahoma Department of Libraries|accessdate=1 June 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070812124843/http://www.odl.state.ok.us/servlibs/l-files/glossd.htm|archivedate=12 August 2007|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Subject cataloging===
Subject cataloging&lt;ref name="tufts.edu"&gt;http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/publications/Berti-Costa_Alexandria_Kentucky.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; may take the form of classification or (subject) indexing. [[Library classification|Classification]] involves the assignment of a given document to a class in a classification system (such as [[Dewey Decimal Classification]] or the [[Library of Congress Subject Headings]]). Indexing is the assignment of characterizing labels to the documents represented in a record.

Classification typically uses a [[controlled vocabulary]], while indexing may use a controlled vocabulary, free terms, or both.

==History==
{{Main|Library catalog#History}}

Libraries have made use of catalogs in some form since ancient times.  The library of Ninevah had the first classification system.  It is located in present-day Iraq.  The first known cataloging occurred with ancient clay tablets.  They had marks on each side of the tablet.  There is evidence of catalogs dating back to approximately 310/05-240 B.C. in [[Sumer]].&lt;ref name=casson&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first catalogs in the [[Muslim world|Islamic world]], around the 11th century, were lists of books donated to libraries by persons in the community. These lists were ordered by donor, not by bibliographic information, but they provided a record of the library's inventory.&lt;ref name=lerner /&gt;

Many early and [[medieval]] libraries in Europe were associated with religious institutions and orders, including the [[Vatican Library|Papal library]] in Rome. The first [[Vatican Library]] catalog is from the late 14th century. These catalogs generally used a topical arrangement that reflected the topical arrangement of the books themselves. The Vatican Library published 'rules for the catalog of printed books'&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Frick|first=Bertha M.|date=1949-06-30|title=The Vatican Library: Rules for the Catalog of Printed Books (Book Review)|url=https://crl.acrl.org/index.php/crl/article/view/10461/11907|journal=College &amp; Research Libraries|language=en|volume=10|issue=3|issn=2150-6701}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1939. These rules were then translated to English and published in the US in 1949.&lt;ref name=lerner /&gt;  Meanwhile, the [[Sorbonne]] library in Paris had accumulated more than one thousand books, and in 1290 their catalog pioneered the use of the alphabet as an organizing tool.&lt;ref name=battles /&gt;

It was the growth in libraries after the invention of moveable-type printing and the widespread availability of paper that created the necessity for a catalog that organized the library's materials so that they could be found through the catalog rather than "by walking around." By the 17th century libraries became seen as collections of universal knowledge. Two 17th century authors, [[Gabriel Naudé]], in France, and [[John Dury]], in Scotland, both developed theories of systematic organization of libraries.&lt;ref name=lerner /&gt; The development of principles and rules that would guide the librarian in the creation of catalogs followed. The history of cataloging begins at this point.

In ancient times in the orient the title was used to identify the work.  Since the renaissance the author has been the main source of identification.

==Cataloging standards==

Cataloging  rules have been defined to allow for consistent cataloging of various library materials across several persons of a cataloging team and across time.

===Anglo-American cataloging standards===
The English-speaking libraries have shared cataloging standards since the early 1800s. The first such standard is attributed to [[Anthony Panizzi]], the Keeper of the Printed Books of the British Museum Library. His 91 rules, published in 1841, formed the basis for cataloging standards for over 150 years.&lt;ref name=chan&gt;{{Citation
|publisher = The Scarecrow Press, Inc.

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequent work in the 19th century was done by [[Charles Coffin Jewett]], head of the Smithsonian library, which at the time was positioned to become the national library of the United States. Jewett used stereotype plates to produce the library's catalog in book form, and proposed the sharing of cataloging among libraries. His rules were published in 1853.&lt;ref name=chan /&gt; A disagreement with the head Smithsonian secretary caused Jewett to be dismissed from his position but soon after he accepted a position with the Boston Public Library. He was tasked with purchasing books as well as arranging them. Jewett earned the role of director of the Boston Public Library in 1858; during this time the ''Index to the Catalogue of a Portion of the Public Library of the City of Boston Arranged in its Lower Hall'' was published. The article included new cataloging information alongside many of the Smithsonian cataloging rules that Jewett created. His systems became a model for other libraries as he pushed for alphabetical card catalogs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.moyak.com/papers/history-library-catalogues.html|title=Historical Development of Library Catalogues: Their Purpose and Organization|last=Mason|first=Moya K.|date=|website=moyak.com |archive-url=|archivedate=|dead-url=|accessdate=June 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jewett was followed by [[Charles Ammi Cutter]], an American librarian whose ''Rules for a Dictionary Catalog'' were published in 1876. Cutter championed the concept of "ease of use" for library patrons.&lt;ref name=chan /&gt;

In the 20th century, library cataloging was forced to address new formats for materials, including sound recordings, movies, and photographs. [[Seymour Lubetzky]], once an employee of the [[Library of Congress]] and later a professor at [[UCLA]], wrote a critique of the 1949 ALA rules for entry, ''Cataloging Rules and Principles: A Critique of the ALA Rules for Entry and a Proposed Design for the Revision''.  Lubetzky's writings revealed the weaknesses in the existing rules, and spoke to the need for preparing a set of standards for a more complete and succinct code.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://scholar.princeton.edu/sites/default/files/steven.a.knowlton/files/criticismofcatlogingcodereform.pdf|title=Criticism of Cataloging Code Reform, as Seen in the Pages of Library Resources and Technical Services (1957–66) |last=Knowlton|first=Steven|date=May 1, 2007|website=OpenScholar Princeton|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As changes in culture over time would necessitate an ever-increasing/changing list of rules, Lubetzky "helped remedy the situation by advocating the concept of cataloging according to 'basic principles,' in place of a rule for each case that might arise." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ideals.illinois.edu/handle/2142/3872 |last=Lehnus |first=Donald J. |title=A Comparison of Panizzi's 91 Rules and the AACR of 1967 |work=Ideals @ Illinois |publisher=Graduate School of Library and Information Science. University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign |date= 1 January 1972 |hdl=hdl.handle.net/2142/3872 |access-date=6 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was tasked to do extensive studies of the current cataloging rules over the time period from 1946-1969. His analyses shaped the subsequent cataloging rules.&lt;ref name=chan /&gt;

The published American and Anglo-American cataloging rules in the 20th century were:&lt;ref name=chan /&gt;
* Anglo-American rules: {{cite book |title=Catalog Rules: Author and Title Entries |date=1908}}
* American Library Association rules: {{cite book |title=A.L.A. Cataloguing Rules for Author and Title Entries |date=1949}}
* Library of Congress rules: {{cite book |title=Rules for Descriptive Cataloging in the Library of Congress |date=1949}}
* AACR: {{cite book |title=Anglo-American Cataloguing Rules |date=1967}}
* AACR2: {{cite book |title=Anglo-American Cataloguing Rules |date=1978 |edition= 2nd |isbn=0-8389-3210-X}}
* AACR2-R: {{cite book |title=Anglo-American Cataloguing Rules |date=1988 |edition= 2nd revised |isbn=0-8389-3346-7}}

The 21st century brought renewed thinking about library cataloging, in great part based on the increase in the number of digital formats, but also because of a new consciousness of the nature of the "Work" in the bibliographic context, often attributed to the principles developed by Lubetzky.&lt;ref name=work&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This was also supported by the work of the International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions on the [[Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records]] (FRBR), which emphasized the role of the work in the bibliographic context.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; FRBR created a tiered view of the bibliographic entity from Item, Manifestation, Expression, to Work. Item refers to the physical form of the book. Manifestation refers to the publication. Expression meaning the translation of the book from other languages. Work refers to the content and ideas of the book.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.loc.gov/cds/downloads/FRBR.PDF&lt;/ref&gt; This view was incorporated into the cataloging rules subsequent to AACR2-R, known as [[Resource Description and Access]] (RDA).

===England===
The [[Bodleian Library]] at [[Oxford University]] developed its cataloging code in 1674. The code emphasized authorship, and books by the same author were listed together in the catalog.

We can trace the origins of modern library cataloging practice back to the 1830s and Anthony Panizzi's 91 rules. Panizzi's singular insight was that a large catalog needed consistency in its entries if it was to serve the user.&lt;ref&gt;"Library Data in a Modern Context." Library Technology Reports, vol. 46, no. 1, Jan. 2010, pp. 5-13. EBSCOhost, gatekeeper2.lindenwood.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=a9h&amp;AN=48650360&amp;site=ehost-live.&lt;/ref&gt; The first major English-language cataloguing code was that developed by Sir Anthony Panizzi for the British Museum catalogue. Panizzi's 91 rules were approved by the British Museum in 1839, and published in 1841.&lt;ref&gt;Panizzi, Anthony. “Rules for the Compilation of the Catalogue,” Catalogue of Printed Books in the British Museum, (1841), v. 1, p. [v]-ix.&lt;/ref&gt;  The British Museum rules were revised up until 1936. The library departments of the British Museum became part of the new British Library in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;"Early English Language Cataloguing Codes." Joint Steering Committee for Development of RDA: A Brief History of AACR. 1 July 2009. Web. 01 July 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germany and Prussia===
The Prussian government set standard rules for all of its libraries in 1899. The rules were based on those of the University Library at [[Breslau]] by [[Karl Franz Otto Dziatzko]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wedgeworth|first1=Robert|title=World Encyclopedia of Library and Information Services ALA WORLD ENCYCLOPEDIA OF LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SERVICES|date=1993|publisher=American Library Association|isbn=0838906095 |page=260 |edition= illustrated}}&lt;/ref&gt; These were adopted throughout Germany, Prussia and Austria.

The Prussian Instructions was a standardized system of cataloging authorized in 1908. In the Prussian Instructions, titles in literature are arranged grammatically not mechanically and literature is entered under its title.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/124031949|title=Cataloging and classification : an introduction|last=Mai.|first=Chan, Lois|date=2007|publisher=Scarecrow Press|others=Hodges, Theodora, 1922-|isbn=9780810859449|edition= 3rd |location=Lanham, Md.|oclc=124031949}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the adoption of the [[Paris Principles (cataloging)]] in 1961, Germany developed the {{ill|Regeln für die alphabetische Katalogisierung|de}}  (RAK) in 1977.&lt;ref name="encyc"&gt;Wiegand, Wayne A, and Donald G. Davis. ''Encyclopedia of Library History''. New York: Garland Pub, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/bibframe/docs/bibframe2-model.html|title=Overview of the BIBFRAME 2.0 Model (BIBFRAME - Bibliographic Framework Initiative, Library of Congress)|website=www.loc.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The goal of the Paris Principles was to serve as a basis for international standardization in cataloguing. Most of the cataloguing codes that were developed worldwide since that time have followed the Principles.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ifla.org/files/assets/cataloguing/icp/icp_2016-en.pdf Statement of International Cataloguing Principles (ICP)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cataloging codes===
Cataloging codes prescribe which information about a bibliographic item is included in the entry and how this information is presented for the user; It may also aid to sort the entries in printing (parts of) the catalog.

Currently, most cataloging codes are similar to, or even based on, the [[International Standard Bibliographic Description]] (ISBD), a set of rules produced by the [[International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions]] (IFLA) to describe a wide range of library materials. These rules organize the bibliographic description of an item in the following eight areas: title and statement of responsibility (author or editor), edition, material specific details (for example, the scale of a map), publication and distribution, physical description (for example, number of pages), series, notes, and standard number ([[ISBN]]).  There is an initiative called the Bibliographic Framework (Bibframe) that is "an initiative to evolve bibliographic description standards to a linked data model, in order to make bibliographic information more useful both within and outside the library community."&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; The most commonly used cataloging code in the English-speaking world was the ''[[Anglo-American Cataloguing Rules]], 2nd edition'' (AACR2).  AACR2 provides rules for ''descriptive cataloging'' only and does not touch upon ''subject cataloging''. AACR2 has been translated into many languages, for use around the world. The German-speaking world uses the ''Regeln für die alphabetische Katalogisierung'' (RAK), also based on ISBD. The Library of Congress implemented the transition to RDA from AACR2 in March 2013.

In subject databases such as Chemical Abstracts, MEDLINE and PsycINFO, the Common Communication Format (CCF) is meant to serve as a baseline standard.  Different standards prevail in archives and museums, such as [[CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model|CIDOC-CRM]].  [[Resource Description and Access]] (RDA) is a recent attempt to make a standard that crosses the domains of [[cultural heritage]] institutions.

===Digital formats===
Most libraries currently use the [[MARC standards]]—first piloted from January 1966 to June 1968&lt;ref&gt;Morton, Katharine D. (1986). The MARC Formats:  An Overview. American Archivist, 49(1), 22.&lt;/ref&gt; —to encode and transport bibliographic data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Schudel|first=Matt|title=Henriette Avram, 'Mother of MARC,' Dies|url=https://www.loc.gov/loc/lcib/0605/avram.html|publisher=Library of Congress|accessdate=June 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=web-of-data&gt;{{cite report|last=Miller|first=Eric|title=Bibliographic Framework as a Web of Data:  Linked Data Model and Supporting Services|url=https://www.loc.gov/bibframe/pdf/marcld-report-11-21-2012.pdf|publisher=Library of Congress|accessdate=28 May 2014|author2=Uche Ogbuji |author3=Victoria Mueller |author4=Kathy MacDougall |date=21 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
These standards have seen critiques in recent years for being old, unique to the library community, and difficult to work with computationally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kroeger|first=Angela|title=The Road to BIBFRAME: The Evolution of the Idea of Bibliographic Transition into a Post-MARC Future|journal=Cataloging &amp; Classification Quarterly|volume=51|issue=8|pages=873–890|doi=10.1080/01639374.2013.823584}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Library of Congress is currently developing BIBFRAME, an RDA schema for expressing bibliographic data. BIBFRAME is being revised and piloted currently by the Library of Congress, but still is not available to the public. It will first be available to vendors to try out, but afterwards there will be a hybrid form of the system (MARC and BIBFRAME) until the data can be fully translated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/bibframe/faqs/#q05|title=BIBFRAME Frequently Asked Questions (Bibliographic Framework Transition Initiative, Library of Congress)|website=www.loc.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Library digital collections often use simpler digital formats to store their metadata.  XML-based schemata, particularly [[Dublin Core]] and [[Metadata Object Description Schema|MODS]], are typical for bibliographic data about these collections.

===Transliteration===
Library items that are written in a foreign script are, in some cases, [[transliteration|transliterated]] to the script of the catalog. In the United States and some other countries, catalogers typically use the [[ALA-LC romanization]] tables for this work. If this is not done, there would need to be separate catalogs for each script.

==Ethical issues==
Ferris maintains that catalogers, in using their judgment and specialized viewpoint, uphold the integrity of the catalog and also provide "added value" to the process of bibliographic control, resulting in added findability for a library's user community.&lt;ref name=ferris&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ferris|first=Anna M.|title=The Ethics and Integrity of Cataloging|journal=Journal of Library Administration|volume=47|issue=3-4|pages=173–190|doi=10.1080/01930820802186514}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This added value also has the power to harm, resulting in the denial of access to information.&lt;ref name=bair&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bair|first=Sheila|title=Toward a Code of Ethics for Cataloging|journal=Technical Services Quarterly|date=13 September 2005|volume=23|issue=1|doi=10.1300/J124v23n01_02}}&lt;!--|accessdate=31 May 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
Mistakes and biases in cataloging records can "stigmatize groups of people with inaccurate or demeaning labels, and create the impression that certain points of view are more normal than others".&lt;ref name=knowlton /&gt;

Social responsibility in cataloging is the "fair and equitable access to relevant, appropriate, accurate, and uncensored information in a timely manner and free of bias".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bair|first=Sheila|title=Toward a Code of Ethics for Cataloging|journal=Technical Services Quarterly|date=13 September 2005|volume=23|issue=1|page=22|doi=10.1300/J124v23n01_02}}&lt;!--|accessdate=31 May 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
In order to act ethically and in a socially responsible manner, catalogers should be aware of how their judgments benefit or harm findability.  They should be careful to not misuse or misrepresent information through inaccurate or minimal-level cataloging and to not purposely or inadvertently censor information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bair|first=Sheila|title=Toward a Code of Ethics for Cataloging|journal=Technical Services Quarterly|date=13 September 2005|volume=23|issue=1|pages=16–18|doi=10.1300/J124v23n01_02}}&lt;!--|accessdate=31 May 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Bair states that it is the professional obligation of catalogers to supply thorough, accurate, high-quality surrogate records for databases and that catalogers also have an ethical obligation to "contribute to the fair and equitable access to information."&lt;ref name=bair16&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bair|first=Sheila|title=Toward a Code of Ethics for Cataloging|journal=Technical Services Quarterly|date=13 September 2005|volume=23|issue=1|page=16|doi=10.1300/J124v23n01_02}}&lt;!--|accessdate=31 May 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Bair recommends that catalogers "actively participate in the development, reform, and fair application of cataloging rules, standards, and classifications, as well as information-storage and retrieval systems".&lt;ref name=bair16 /&gt; As stated by Knowlton, access points "should be what a particular type of library patron would be most likely to search under -- regardless of the notion of [[universal bibliographic control]]."&lt;ref name=knowlton /&gt;

A formal code of ethics for catalogers does not exist, and thus catalogers often follow library or departmental policy to resolve conflicts in cataloging.  While the American Library Association created a "Code of Ethics",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ala.org/ala/issuesadvocacy/proethics/codeofethics/codeethics.cfm|title=Professional Ethics|first=|last=RBERQUIST|date=19 May 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ferris notes that it has been criticized for being too general to encompass the special skills that set catalogers apart from other library and information professionals.&lt;ref name=ferris /&gt;  As stated by Tavani, a code of ethics for catalogers can "inspire, guide, educate, and discipline" (as cited in Bair, 2005, p.&amp;nbsp;22). Bair suggests that an effective code of ethics for catalogers should be aspirational and also "discuss specific conduct and actions in order to serve as a guide in actual situations". Bair has also laid out the beginnings for a formal code of cataloging ethics in "Toward a Code of Ethics for Cataloging."&lt;ref name=bair /&gt;

==Criticism==
[[Sanford Berman]], former Head Cataloger of the [[Hennepin County Library]] in Minnetonka, Minnesota, has been a leading critic of biased headings in the [[Library of Congress Subject Headings]].  Berman's 1971 publication ''Prejudices and Antipathies: A Tract on the LC Subject Heads Concerning People'' (''P&amp;amp;A'') has sparked the movement to correct biased subject headings.  In ''P&amp;amp;A'', Berman listed 225 headings with proposed alterations, additions, or deletions and cross-references to "more accurately reflect the language used in addressing these topics, to rectify errors of bias, and to better guide librarians and readers to material of interest".&lt;ref name=knowlton /&gt;  Berman is well known for his "care packages," mailings containing clippings and other materials in support of changes to subject headings and against racism, sexism, homophobia, and governmental secrecy, among other areas for concern.

In "Three Decades Since ''Prejudices and Antipathies'': A Study of Changes in the Library of Congress Subject Headings," Knowlton examines ways in which the Library of Congress Subject Headings (LCSH) has changed by compiling a table of changes described in ''P&amp;A'', followed by the current status of headings in question.  Knowlton states that his intent for this table is to "show how many of Berman’s proposed changes have been implemented" and "which areas of bias are still prevalent in LCSH."  In the discussion of Knowlton's findings, it is revealed that of the 225 headings suggested for change by Berman, only 88 (39%) have been changed exactly or very closely to his suggestions (p.&amp;nbsp;127). Another 54 (24%) of headings have been changed but only partially resolve Berman's objections, and "which may leave other objectionable wording intact or introduce a different shade of bias."  80 (36%) headings were not changed at all according to Berman's suggestions.&lt;ref name=knowlton&gt;{{cite journal|last=Knowlton|first=Steven A.|title=Three Decades Since Prejudices and Antipathies: A Study of Changes in the Library of Congress Subject Headings|journal=Cataloging &amp; Classification Quarterly|volume=40|issue=2|pages=123–145|doi=10.1300/J104v40n02_08|url=http://www.sanfordberman.org/biblinks/knowlton.pdf|accessdate=31 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Queer theory and cataloging===
Building on Berman's critique of cataloging practices, [[Queer theory|queer theorists]] in library and information science such as [[Emily Drabinski]] and [[Amber Billey]] have written about the implications of creating stable categorizations for gender identities.&lt;ref name="rda97"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Billey|first1=Amber|last2=Drabinski|first2=Emily|last3=Roberto|first3=K. R.|title=What's Gender Got to Do With It? A Critique of RDA Rule 9.7|journal=Cataloging and Classification Quarterly|date=24 April 2014|volume=52|issue=4|pages=412–421|doi=10.1080/01639374.2014.882465}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Utilizing queer theory in conjunction with library classification and cataloging requires perspectives that can present both ethically and politically sound viewpoints that support marginalized persons such as women, people of color, or members of the LGBTQ+ community.&lt;ref&gt;Drabinski, E. (2013). Queering the Catalog: Queer Theory and the Politics of Correction. The Library Quarterly, 83(2), 94-111. doi:10.1086/669547&lt;/ref&gt; This work has resulted in the modification of [[RDA: Resource Description and Access|RDA]] Rule 9.7, governing how gender is represented in record creation. At the [[American Library Association|ALA Midwinter]] meeting in January 2016, the [[controlled vocabulary]] for gender in RDA was abolished, allowing catalogers and libraries to describe a person's gender in whatever terms best represent that person.&lt;ref name="locslides"&gt;{{cite web|title=RDA Changes through April 2016|url=https://www.loc.gov/aba/pcc/documents/OpCo-2016/RDA-Changes-through-April%202016.pdf|website=Library of Congress|accessdate=29 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cataloging terms==
* '''Main entry''' or '''access point''' generally refers to the first author named on the item. Additional authors are added as "added entries." In cases where no clear author is named, the [[title (publishing)|title]] of the work is considered the main entry.
* '''[[Authority control]]''' is a process of using a single, specific term for a person, place, or title to maintain consistency between access points within a catalog. Effective authority control prevents a user having to search for multiple variations of a title, author, or term.
* '''Cooperative cataloging''' refers to an approach in which libraries collaborate in the creation of bibliographic and authority records, establishing cataloging practices and utilizing systems that facilitate the use of shared records.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.loc.gov/aba/about/catfaq.html|title = Frequently Asked Questions about Cataloging|date = 2013-07-19|accessdate = 2014-09-16|website = Cataloging and Acquisitions - Library of Congress|publisher = Library of Congress|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, she was appointed adviser to [[President of France]], [[Nicolas Sarkozy]], and in charge of the "political center" at the [[Élysée Palace]] from March 2008. Since 2011 she has headed [[Public Establishment of the Palace, Museum and National Estate of Versailles]] that administer the [[Palace of Versailles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Marianne Lohse |url=http://www.francetoday.com/articles/2012/08/01/catherine_pegard.html |title=Catherine Pégard |publisher=France Today |date=2012-08-01 |accessdate=2014-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pégard was awarded [[Chevalier de la Légion d'honneur]] in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.leparisien.fr/espace-premium/actu/les-decores-de-paques-08-04-2012-1944737.php |title=Les décorés de Pâques |publisher=Leparisien.fr |date= |accessdate=2014-06-17 |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early career ==

Pégard was born in [[Le Havre]] and after high school had her first experience with journalism under the leadership of [[:fr:Roger Campion|Roger Campion]], the editor of the local ''[[:fr:Le Havre libre|Le Havre Libre]]''.

After studying [[Historiography|history]] and [[political science]], Pégard began her journalistic career in 1977. From 1978 to 1982, she wrote about politics in ''[[Le Quotidien de Paris]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.la-croix.com/Culture/Actualite/Catherine-Pegard-une-journaliste-au-chateau-2014-01-24-1096010 |title=Catherine Pégard, une journaliste au château |language=French |publisher=La-Croix.com |date=2014-01-24 |accessdate=2014-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== At ''Le Point'' ==

Pégard joined ''[[Le Point]]'' as a political journalist in 1982. She covered in particular the area of parliamentary news. When [[Denis Jeambar]] became [[editor-in-chief]] in 1988, as well as editor-in-chief of the political and cultural departments, Pégard became his assistant. After Jeambar left and became general director of ''[[Europe 1]]'' in 1995, Pégard took over as editor-in-chief of ''Le Point''.

Pégard published a weekly "Political notebook" in ''Le Point'' fed from the backstage of politics. At the same time, she discussed political news on [[:fr:Radio Classique|Radio Classique]] with [[:fr:Jean-Marc Lech|Jean-Marc Lech]]. From October 2004, she also co-hosted the show ''Les Femmes et les Patrons d'abord'' ("The Women and the Patrons First") on [[Paris Première]] alongside [[:fr:Alexandra Golovanoff|Alexandra Golovanoff]].

== At the Elysee ==

Pégard left ''Le Point'' in 2007, when she was appointed [[adviser]] to [[President of France|President]] [[Nicolas Sarkozy]]. The appointment of a journalist-editor from a major newspaper such as ''Le Point'' as advisor to the President sparked controversy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.20minutes.fr/politique/778524-catherine-pegard-conseillere-nicolas-sarkozy-nommee-chateau-versailles |title=Catherine Pégard, conseillère de Nicolas Sarkozy, nommée au Château de Versailles |publisher=20minutes.fr |language=French |date=2011-08-31 |accessdate=2014-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Asked about the issue of relations between the press and politics in France, the reporter [[John Vinocur]] from the ''[[International Herald Tribune]]'' responded in an interview by [[:fr:Renaud Revel|Renaud Revel]] in ''[[L'Express (France)|L'Express]]'' (31 May 2007): "I think that you exaggerate the complicity of the links that in reality exist in all the democracies of the world. Journalists have become the scapegoats of a society at odds with its elites."

Independent advisor to the President from May 2007, Pégard in mid-March 2008 became the head of the new "political center" created by the Presidency, integrating the closest collaborators of the President.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.20minutes.fr/france/224261-autre-femme-sarkozy-ecoute |title=L'autre femme que Sarkozy écoute |publisher=20minutes.fr |date=2008-04-08 |accessdate=2014-06-17 |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was assisted by [[:fr:Jerome Peyrat|Jerome Peyrat]], the councilor in charge of the President's relations with [[French Parliament|Parliament]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/politique/article/2010/04/13/nicolas-sarkozy-recadre-le-travail-de-ses-conseillers-a-l-elysee_1332796_823448.html |title=Nicolas Sarkozy recadre le travail de ses conseillers à l'Elysée |work=[[Le Monde]] |publisher=Lemonde.fr |date=2010-04-13 |accessdate=2014-06-17 |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; Catherine Pégard subsequently was responsible for cultural matters at the Elysee.

== At Versailles ==

Pégard was appointed to the presidency of the [[Public Establishment of the Palace, Museum and National Estate of Versailles]] by the [[Cabinet of France]] on 31 August 2011, and took office on 2 October, succeeding [[Jean-Jacques Aillagon]], who went on pension.

The appointment of Pégard was denounced publicly by some heritage professionals, regretting that she lacked experience in the management of cultural administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.liberation.fr/culture/01012357165-catherine-pegard-nommee-a-versailles |title=Catherine Pégard nommée à Versailles - Libération |publisher=Liberation.fr |date=2011-08-31 |accessdate=2014-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Didier Rykner |url=http://www.latribunedelart.com/le-scandale-de-la-nomination-de-catherine-pegard-a-la-tete-de-versailles-article003250.html |title=Le scandale de la nomination de Catherine Pégard à la tête de Versailles |work=La Tribune de l'Art |publisher=Latribunedelart.com |date=30 March 2011 |accessdate=2014-06-17 |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/idees/article/2011/09/05/non-au-nouveau-fait-du-prince-a-versailles_1567856_3232.html |title=Non au nouveau fait du prince à Versailles ! |work=[[Le Monde]] |publisher=Lemonde.fr |date=5 September 2011 |accessdate=2014-06-17 |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Pégard endorsed an exhibition with photographs by [[Ahae]], the South Korean businessman [[Yoo Byung-eun]], praising his artistic qualities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Hasquenoph |first=Bernard |url=http://www.louvrepourtous.fr/La-Philarmonie-de-Paris,774.html |title=La Philharmonie de Paris maintiendra-t-elle une expo Ahae malgré l'affaire du Sewol? |trans-title=Will the Philharmonie de Paris still hold an Ahae exhibition despite the Sewol affair? |publisher=louvrepourtous.fr |language=French |date=14 May 2014 |accessdate=1 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="exponaute1"&gt;{{cite news|first=Magali |last=Lesauvage |url=http://www.exponaute.com/magazine/2014/06/10/mecene-artiste-gourou-ennemi-public-limprobable-affaire-ahae/ |title=Mécène-artiste, gourou, ennemi public : l'improbable affaire Ahae |trans-title=Patron-artist, guru, public enemy: the improbable case Ahae |language=French |publisher=Exponaute.com |date=10 June 2014 |accessdate=16 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lexpress1"&gt;{{cite news|last=Mathieu |first=Beatrice |url=http://lexpansion.lexpress.fr/actualite-economique/ahae-artiste-gangster-et-mecene-du-louvre_1550106.html |title=Ahae, artiste, gangster... et mécène du Louvre |trans-title=Ahae, artist, gangster ... and patron of the Louvre |language=French |work=[[L'Express]] |publisher=Lexpansion.lexpress.fr |date=10 June 2014 |accessdate=16 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pégard disclosed that the exhibition was on a sponsorship basis, saying "The artist himself wanted to rent the Orangerie.

'''Codex Purpureus Beratinus''' designated by '''Φ''' or '''043''' (in the [[Biblical manuscript#Gregory-Aland|Gregory-Aland]] numbering), ε 17 ([[Biblical manuscript#Von Soden|von Soden]]), is an [[uncial]] [[illuminated manuscript]] [[Gospel book]] written in [[Greek language|Greek]]. Dated [[Palaeography|palaeographically]] to the 6th-century, the [[manuscript]] is written in an uncial hand on [[Purple parchment|purple vellum]] with silver ink. The [[codex]] is preserved at the Albanian National Archives (Nr. 1) in [[Tirana]], [[Albania]].{{r|Aland}} It was formerly possessed by the [[Saint George|St. George]] Church in the town of [[Berat]], Albania, hence the 'Beratinus' appellation.

== Description ==
Codex Beratinus contains only the [[Gospel of Matthew]] and the [[Gospel of Mark]], with several considerable [[lacuna (manuscripts)|lacunae]] (Matthew 1:1-6:3, 7:26-8:7, 18:23-19:3, and Mark 14:62-end). The codex contains 190 extant parchment leaves measuring 31.4 × 26.8&amp;nbsp;cm, or approximately the same size as those of [[Codex Alexandrinus]], and have two columns per page, but the letters are much larger.&lt;ref name = Kenyon&gt;[[Frederic G.

Quotations from the [[Old Testament]] are marked with an inverted comma (&lt;).

The text is divided according to the κεφαλαια (chapters) and according to the [[Eusebian Canons|Ammonian Sections]] (smaller than κεφαλαια). On the left margin are inserted the numerals of the κεφαλαια and above the pages are inserted the τιτλοι (titles) of the κεφαλαια. The numerals of the Ammonian sections are given on the left margin, and a references to the Eusebian Canons were added by a later hand in the 8th century. A note in the manuscript states that the loss of the other two Gospels is due to "the [[Franks]] of [[Champagne, France|Champagne]]", i.e. some of the [[Crusades|Crusaders]], who may have seen it while at [[Patmos]], where it was believed formerly to have been.{{r|Kenyon}}

The Greek text of the codex is generally of the [[Byzantine text-type]], but it contains the long [[Western text-type|Western]] addition after Matthew 20:28, occurring also in [[Codex Bezae]]:&lt;ref name = Metzger/&gt; Aland gave for it the following textual profile: 131&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, 83&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt;, 11&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, 18&lt;sup&gt;s&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name = Aland/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"But seek to increase from that which is small, and to become less from which is greater. When you enter into a house and are summoned to dine, do not sit down at the prominent places, lest perchance a man more honorable than you come in afterwards, and he who invited you come and say to you, "Go down lower"; and you shall be ashamed. But if you sit down in the inferior place, and one inferior to you come in, then he that invited you will say to you, "Go up higher"; and this will be advantageous for you."&lt;ref&gt;Bruce M. Metzger, Bart D. Ehrman, ''The Text of the New Testament: Its Transmission, Corruption and Restoration'', [[Oxford University Press]], 2005, p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In [[Matthew 21:9]], the following interpolation occurs, sharing affinity only with [[Curetonian Gospels|syr&lt;sup&gt;cur&lt;/sup&gt;]]:&lt;ref&gt;[[Eberhard Nestle]], [[Erwin Nestle]], Barbara Aland and [[Kurt Aland]] (eds), ''[[Novum Testamentum Graece]]'', 26th edition, (Stuttgart: ''[[Deutsche Bibelgesellschaft]]'', 1991), p. 58.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
''And many went out to meet him; all who were seeing [him] round about were rejoicing and glorifying God.''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In Matthew 27:9, in the phrase επληρωθη το ρηθεν δια Ιερεμιου του προφητου (''fulfilled what was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet'') the word Ιερεμιου ([[Jeremiah]]) is omitted, as in [[Minuscule 33]], [[Codex Vercellensis|a]], [[Codex Veronensis|b]], [[Syriac Sinaiticus|syr&lt;sup&gt;s&lt;/sup&gt;]], [[Peshitta|syr&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;]], and [[Coptic versions of the Bible|cop&lt;sup&gt;bo&lt;/sup&gt;]].&lt;ref name = NA81&gt;ΝΑ26, p. 81&lt;/ref&gt;

In Matthew 27:16 it has additional reading ος δια φονον και στασιν ην βεβλημενοις εις φυλακην (''who for murder and insurrection had been thrown in prison'').&lt;ref name = NA81/&gt;


According to [[Burnett Hillman Streeter|B. H. Streeter]], Codex Beratinus is a tertiary witness of the [[Caesarean text-type|Caesarean text]].&lt;ref&gt;B. H. Streeter, [http://www.katapi.org.uk/4Gospels/Ch4.htm ''The Four Gospels. A Study of Origins the Manuscripts Tradition, Sources, Authorship, &amp; Dates''], MacMillan and Co Limited, Oxford 1924. &lt;/ref&gt; It is grouped with [[Codex Petropolitanus Purpureus|N]], [[Sinope Gospels|O]], [[Rossano Gospels|Σ]], and [[Uncial 080]] to constitute the [[Purple parchment|Purple Uncials]]. [[Kurt Aland|Aland]] categorized the first four into [[Categories of New Testament manuscripts|Category V]],&lt;ref name = Aland/&gt; and it is certain that they are more Byzantine than anything else.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.skypoint.com/members/waltzmn/ManuscriptsUncials.html#uPhi Codex Beratinus Φ (043)]: at the ''Encyclopedia of Textual Criticism''&lt;/ref&gt; Aland did not categorize Uncial 080.&lt;ref name = Aland/&gt;

== History ==
Formerly it was believed to have been at Patmos.&lt;ref name = Kenyon/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Pierre Batiffol]], ''Les manuscrits grecs de Berat d'Albanie et le Codex Purpureus Φ'', Paris 1886, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; According to Xhevat Lloshi it came from [[Ballsh]].&lt;ref&gt;Xhevat Lloshi, [https://books.google.com/books?id=9_gXTda0HS8C&amp;pg=PA94&amp;dq=#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Rreth ALFABETIT Të Shqipes''] (2008), p. 94&lt;/ref&gt; It was held in Berat, Albania from 1356.&lt;ref name = Gregory/&gt; The text of the codex was published by [[Pierre Batiffol]] in 1887. "During [[World War II]], Hitler learned of it and sought it out. Several monks and priests risked their lives to hide the manuscript."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csntm.org/Expedition/Albania2007 Albania Expedition] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090810101850/http://csntm.org/Expedition/Albania2007 |date=2009-08-10 }} at the [[Center for the Study of New Testament Manuscripts|CSNTM]]&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1971, it has been preserved at the [[National Archives of Albania]] in Tirana.&lt;ref name = Metzger/&gt;&lt;ref name = INTF&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://intf.uni-muenster.de/vmr/NTVMR/ListeHandschriften.php?ObjID=20043 |title=Liste Handschriften |publisher=Institute for New Testament Textual Research |accessdate=16 March 2013 |location=Münster}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Oscar von Gebhardt]] designated it by [[siglum]] Φ, which is often used in critical editions.

==Importance as Cultural Heritage==
The Codex Purpureus Beratinus was inscribed on the [[UNESCO]]’s [[Memory of the World Register]] in 2005 in recognition of its historical significance. The two Beratinus codices preserved in Albania are very important for the global community and the development of ancient biblical, liturgical and hagiographical literature and are part of the "[[Purple parchment|seven purple codices]]”, which were written over a period of 13 centuries, i.e. from the sixth to the eighteenth centuries. The other five “purple codices” are in [[Italy]] (two), [[France]] (one), [[England]] (one), and [[Greece]] (one).&lt;ref name=mow&gt;{{cite web |title= Codex Purpureus Beratinus |url= http://portal.unesco.org/ci/en/ev.php-URL_ID=23105&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html | date=2008-05-16 |publisher=UNESCO Memory of the World Programme |accessdate=2009-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{more footnotes|date=January 2018}}
'''DNSCrypt''' is a [[network protocol]] which authenticates and encrypts [[Domain Name System]] (DNS) traffic between the user's [[computer]] and recursive [[name server]]s. It was originally designed by Frank Denis and Yecheng Fu.

Although multiple client and server implementations exist, the protocol was never proposed to the [[Internet Engineering Task Force]] (IETF) by the way of a [[Request for Comments]] (RFC).

DNSCrypt wraps unmodified DNS traffic between a client and a DNS resolver in a cryptographic construction in order to detect forgery. Though it doesn't provide end-to-end security, it protects the local network against man-in-the-middle attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://github.com/jedisct1/dnscrypt-proxy |title= DNSCrypt Proxy README.markdown |publisher=Github}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

It also mitigates UDP-based amplification attacks by requiring a question to be at least as large as the corresponding response. Thus, DNSCrypt helps to prevent [[DNS spoofing]].  

DNSCrypt can also be used for access control, as done by [[Comodo Group|Comodo]] in their cDome Shield product.

==Deployment==
In addition to private deployments, the DNSCrypt protocol has been adopted by several public DNS resolvers, the vast majority being members of the [[OpenNIC]] network, as well as [[virtual private network]] (VPN) services.

[[OpenDNS]] (now a part of [[Cisco]]) announced the first public DNS service supporting DNSCrypt in December 2011, shortly followed by CloudNS Australia.

On March 29, 2016, [[Yandex]] announced support for the DNSCrypt protocol on their public DNS servers, as well as in their [[Yandex Browser|web browser]].

Later, [[Infoblox]] announced ActiveTrust Cloud, leveraging DNSCrypt to secure DNS communications.

On October, 2016, [[AdGuard]] added DNSCrypt to their DNS filtering module so that users could move from their ISPs to custom or AdGuard's own DNS servers for online privacy and [[ad blocking]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://blog.adguard.com/en/adguard-dns-now-supports-dnscrypt |title= AdGuard DNS Now Supports DNSCrypt}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://kb.adguard.com/en/general/dns-filtering-android |title= DNS Filtering Android}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Quad9]] public DNS resolver service run by the not-for-profit organization contributed by IBM, Packet Clearing House, and Global Cyber Alliance announced support for DNSCrypt in September 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.quad9.net/privacy-dnscrypt-testing/ |title= DNSCrypt Now in Testing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other servers that support secure protocol are mentioned in the DNSCrypt creators’ list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://dnscrypt.info/public-servers |title= DNSCrypt Resolvers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Protocol==
DNSCrypt can be used either over [[User Datagram Protocol|UDP]] or over [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]]. In both cases, its default port is 443, even though the protocol radically differs from [[HTTPS]].

Instead of relying on trusted [[certificate authorities]] commonly found in web browsers, the client has to explicitly trust the public signing key of the chosen provider.

This public key is used to verify a set of certificates, retrieved using conventional DNS queries.
These certificates contain short-term public keys used for key exchange, as well as an identifier of the cipher suite to use.
Clients are encouraged to generate a new key for every query, while servers are encouraged to rotate short-term key pairs every 24 hours.

Queries and responses are encrypted using the same algorithm and padded to a multiple of 64 bytes in order to avoid leaking packet sizes. 
Over UDP, when a response would be larger than the question leading to it, a server can respond with a short packet whose TC (truncated) bit has been set. The client should then retry using TCP and increase the padding of subsequent queries.

Versions 1 and 2 of the protocol use the [[X25519]] algorithm for key exchange, [[EdDSA]] for signatures, as well as X[[Salsa20]]-[[Poly1305]] or X[[ChaCha20]]-Poly1305 for authenticated encryption.

==Public-key based client authentication==
The DNSCrypt protocol can also be used for access control or accounting, by accepting only a predefined set of public keys. This can be used by commercial DNS services to identify customers without having to rely on IP addresses.

Detective Superintendent '''Andrew "Andy" Dalziel''' {{IPAc-en|audio=Dalziel.ogg|d|iː|ˈ|ɛ|l}} and Detective Sergeant, later Detective Inspector, '''Peter Pascoe'''  are two fictional [[Yorkshire]] [[detective]]s featuring in a series of novels by [[Reginald Hill]].

==Characterisation and style==
Dalziel is depicted as being rude, insensitive and blunt, whereas Pascoe is calm, polite and well mannered.

Hill's mysteries often break with storytelling tradition. The novels employ various structural tricks, such as presenting parts of the story in non-chronological order, or alternating with sections from a novel supposedly written by Peter's wife, Ellie Pascoe (née Soper). The novella ''One Small Step'' is even set in the future, and deals with the detectives investigating a [[murder]] on the [[moon]]. In another departure from the norm, the duo do not always "get their man", with at least one novel ending with the villain getting away and another strongly implying that what Dalziel and Pascoe dismiss as a series of unrelated accidents actually included at least one undetected instance of murder.

==TV series==
{{main|Dalziel and Pascoe (TV series)}}
* [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] adapted the novel ''A Pinch of Snuff'' in 1993 for a three-part [[Serial (radio and television)|serial]]. The serial starred comedy duo [[Gareth Hale]] as Dalziel and [[Norman Pace]] as Pascoe. [[Christopher Fairbank]] was cast as DS Edgar Wield. [[Reginald Hill]] was not happy with the adaptation, and it remained a one-off, much to ITV's disappointment.
* The [[BBC]] created a more successful series of adaptations, beginning in March 1996, with an adaptation of the first novel, ''[[A Clubbable Woman]]''. Produced by [[BBC Birmingham]], the series starred [[Warren Clarke]] as Dalziel, [[Colin Buchanan (actor)|Colin Buchanan]] as Pascoe, David Royle as DS Edgar "Wieldy" Wield and [[Susannah Corbett]] as Ellie Pascoe. Later series introduced Jo-Anne Stockham as DC Shirley "Ivor" Novello, [[Keeley Forsyth]] as DC Carrie "Tweedie" Harris, [[Katy Cavanagh]] as DS Dawn "Spike" Milligan and [[Jennifer James]] as DC Kim "Posh" Spicer. Twelve series were produced in total, concluding in June 2007. The BBC series won much critical acclaim from [[newspaper]]s such as ''[[The Daily Express]]'' and ''[[The Sunday Times (UK)|The Sunday Times]]''. The television and novel continuities are separate, with both Ellie and Wield having appeared in the most recent books, despite having been written out of the TV series.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1058">A '''dispute pyramid''' is an upside-down triangle that illustrates how many grievances result in legal proceedings, such as a [[trial]] or [[Hearing (law)|hearing]]. Court filings are at the bottom as the smallest amount, then lawyers, then [[Cause of action|claims]], and finally grievances at the top with the largest number. It demonstrates how a large number of grievances, for example, one thousand, will filter down to around seven hundred claims, only one hundred lawyers will be hired, and only fifty court filings will occur out of those one thousand grievances.  Researchers believe that approximately one in every twenty cases that could potentially be brought to court will actually be brought to court. The reason for this phenomenon is the existence of [[settlement (litigation)|settlements]] outside the court itself, and the pyramid demonstrates this through numbers.

'''Fodor's''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|f|oʊ|d|ər|z}} is a publisher of [[English language]] [[travel]] and [[tourism]] information and the first relatively professional{{clarify|date=October 2016}} producer of travel guidebooks.{{cn|date=October 2016}} Fodor's Travel and Fodors.com are divisions of [[Internet Brands]].

==History==

Founder [[Eugene Fodor (writer)|Eugene Fodor]] was a keen traveler, but felt that the guidebooks of his time were boring, uninspired collections of quickly outdated facts and figures. He decided to address these shortcomings and wrote a guide to [[Europe]], ''On the Continent—The Entertaining Travel Annual'', which was published in 1936 by Francis Aldor, Aldor Publications, London.

Going beyond the usual lists of hotels and attractions, the book was updated yearly and gave practical guidance, such as [[Tip (gratuity)|tip]]ping advice, alongside information about the local people and [[culture]]. For example, in the introduction, Fodor wrote "[[Rome]] contains not only magnificent [[monument]]s, but also [[Italy|Italians]]."

The pioneering book was a success in [[England]] and the [[United States]]. Fodor's Modern Guides, Inc. was founded in 1949 in [[Paris]], [[France]] and [[David McKay Publications|David McKay Company]] began publishing the books a year later. McKay was sold to Random House in 1986.

In 1996, Fodor's launched a travel-related website fodors.com, which was nominated for a [[Webby Award]] in 2004. Fodor's has published more than 440 guides (in 14 series) on over 300 destinations, and has more than 700 permanently placed researchers all over the world.

In 2016, Fodor's was acquired by [[El Segundo, California|El Segundo]], [[California]], based [[Internet Brands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/publisher-news/article/70716-prh-to-sell-fodor-s-to-internet-brands.html|title=Penguin Random House to Sell Fodor's to Internet Brands|work=PublishersWeekly.com|access-date=2017-03-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://skift.com/2016/06/21/fodors-travel-guides-sold-to-internet-brands-by-penguin-random-house/|title=Fodor's Travel Guides Sold to Internet Brands by Penguin Random House|date=2016-06-21|website=Skift|access-date=2017-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Clovis et sa famille.jpg|thumb|[[Clovis I|Clovis]] and his family, 14th-century]]

The '''''Grandes Chroniques de France''''' is a vernacular royal compilation of the history of [[France]], most manuscripts of which are luxury copies that are heavily illuminated.  Copies were produced between the thirteenth and fifteenth centuries, the text being extended at intervals to cover recent events.  It was first compiled in the reign of [[Louis IX of France|Saint Louis]] (d. 1270), who wished to preserve the history of the Franks from the coming of the [[Troy|Trojans]] to his own time, in an "official" chronography whose dissemination was tightly controlled. It was continued under his successors until completed in 1461. It covers the [[Merovingian]], [[Carolingian]], and [[House of Capet|Direct Capetian]] dynasties of French kings, with illustrations depicting personages and events from virtually all their reigns.

It survives in approximately 130 manuscripts,&lt;ref&gt;Hedeman xx; she was able to locate 131 MS., and has "included at the end of the book a Catalogue of Manuscripts dating from 1274 to c. 1420".&lt;/ref&gt; varying in the richness, number and artistic style of their illuminations, copied and amended for royal and courtly patrons, the central work of vernacular official historiography.  Over 75 copies are illustrated, with between one and over 400 scenes shown; analysis of the selections of subjects reveals the changing political preoccupations of the different classes of patrons over time.&lt;ref&gt;Hedeman, xx-xxii&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the contemporary styles of illustration seen in other manuscripts, early copies had mostly fairly small scenes, normally with a patterned background rather than a landscape or interior setting. In front of this a number of figures were engaged in key historical moments, especially battles, coronations, weddings and important meetings.  There might be over 200 such scenes illustrated, often collected together as individual compartments in a full-page miniature with a decorated framework. By the mid-15th century the number of illustrations was fewer, around 50 even in lavish copies, but the miniatures were larger, and now had lovingly detailed landscape or interior backgrounds.  Scenes of ceremonial moments, now often including large crowds, had become more popular, though battles retained their place.&lt;ref&gt;Hedeman, 180&lt;/ref&gt;

==Text==
The ''Grandes Chroniques de France'' had its origin as a French translation of the Latin histories written and updated by the monks of [[Saint Denis Basilica|Saint-Denis]], who were, from the thirteenth century, official historiographers to the French kings.  As first written, the ''Grandes Chroniques'' traced the history of the French kings from their origins in Troy to the death of [[Philip II of France]] (1223). The continuations of the text were drafted first at Saint-Denis and then at the court in Paris. Its final form brought the chronicle down to the death of [[Charles V of France|Charles V]] in the 1380s.

There are also Burgundian variants, which give a different account of the final period, a product of the dissention which finally led to the [[Armagnac–Burgundian Civil War]] in 1407-35.&lt;ref&gt;Hedeman, 154-155&lt;/ref&gt; [[Philip the Good]]'s copy follows the Paris text up to 1226, but then uses [[Guillaume de Nangis]]' ''Chronicon'' up to 1327, and then Flemish chronicles from the monasteries of [[Abbey of Saint Bertin|Saint Bertin]] and Notre Dame at [[Saint-Omer]]. The compiler, Abbot Guillaume Fillastre of Saint Bertin (not [[Guillaume Fillastre|the earlier cardinal]]), aimed to promote Philip's claim to the French throne.  He is shown handing over the work to Philip in the [[presentation miniature]] by [[Simon Marmion]] in Philip's copy.&lt;ref&gt;Voronova and Sterligov, p. 120&lt;/ref&gt;

Sources for material on the reign of [[Charlemagne]] included the ''[[Historia Caroli Magni]]'', also known as the "Pseudo-Turpin Chronicle" and the ''[[Vita Karoli Magni]]'' by [[Einhard]].  Other sources included [[Abbot Suger]]'s ''Life of Louis IV''.&lt;ref name=hasenohr&gt;Geneviève Hasenohr and Michel Zink, eds.  ''Dictionnaire des lettres françaises: Le Moyen Age''. Collection: La Pochothèque.  Paris: Fayard, 1992. pp. 294-7. {{ISBN|2-253-05662-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Manuscripts==
[[File:Prise de Tours en 1189.jpg|thumb|left|[[Philip II of France|Philip II]] captures [[Tours]] in 1189. [[Jean Fouquet]]]]
The earliest surviving copy was presented by the monks of St-Denis to [[Philip III of France|Philip III]] in about 1274, with 36 miniatures (many with multiple scenes) and [[historiated initial]]s by Parisian artists.  These were mostly derived from other manuscript sources, but ingeniously focused into a coherent programme of illustration reflecting the points the abbey wished the king to absorb, regarding both its own aspirations and the nature of kingship in general.&lt;ref&gt;Hedeman, 11; 11-29 describes this fully&lt;/ref&gt;

Especially fine are the lavishly illustrated copies made for [[Charles V of France|Charles V]] ([[BnF]], Ms. Fr. 2813), [[Louis VII of France|Louis VII]], illuminated by [[Jean Fouquet]] (1455-1460,  BnF, Ms. Fr. 6465, above) and [[Philip the Good]] of Burgundy, now in the [[Russian National Library]], [[Saint Petersburg]] (1457, above).

For the first 150 years of the ''Grandes Chroniques'''s existence, its audience was carefully circumscribed: its readership was centered in the royal court at Paris, and its owners included French kings, members of the royal family and the court, and a few highly connected clerics in northern France.  During this period, there were no copies of the work that belonged to members of the [[Parlement]] or the university community.&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Guenée, "Les  Grandes Chroniques de France : Le roman aux rois (1274-1518)," in ''La Nation'', vol. 1, pt. 2,  ''Les lieux de mémoire'', ed. Pierre Nora (Paris, Gallimard, 1986), pp 189-214.&lt;/ref&gt;

But from the mid-15th century a number of unillustrated copies survive "on paper or on mixtures of parchment and paper that belonged (when provenance is known) to secretaries and notaries and to members of the Parlement. These inexpensive books filled a practical need; they provided a chronology for persons charged with maintaining the state archives and doubtless also assisted them in their increasingly common role as writers of history".&lt;ref&gt;Hedeman, 180; note 5: "Of the approximately 30 copies of the Grandes Chroniques that survive from the mid-fifteenth century, at least 20 were unillustrated; of these 20, 18 were written on paper or on paper gatherings with outer leaves of parchment."&lt;/ref&gt;  Latterly, under the Valois [[Dukes of Burgundy]], it spread there as well, and copies were given to foreign royalty.

Of the three copies (not all complete) in the [[Royal manuscripts, British Library]], representing most of what survives from the medieval English royal library, one may have come to England after the capture of King [[John II of France]] 1356 at the [[battle of Poitiers]] (Ms Royal 19 D. ii).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bl.uk/catalogues/illuminatedmanuscripts/TourHistoryVernac.asp "Royal Vernacular Chronicles"], British Library&lt;/ref&gt;  A unusually late copy, never finished, was begun in [[Calais]] in 1487, commissioned by the Treasurer of the English enclave for presentation to the new [[Henry VII of England]].  The miniatures that were completed seem to be by English artists.&lt;ref&gt;McKendrick et al., 350-351; Hedeman, 181&lt;/ref&gt;

Printed copies on [[vellum]], which were then illuminated, were produced in Paris by [[Antoine Vérard]], who specialized in such hybrids, and normal editions by others, but by around 1500 the work seems to have been regarded as outdated, and was replaced by other texts.  Altogether only four early print editions were made, all in Paris.  These were in 1477, 1493, 1514 and 1518.&lt;ref&gt;Hedeman, [http://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/view?docId=ft8k4008jd&amp;chunk.id=nsd0e6116&amp;toc.id=endnotes&amp;toc.depth=1&amp;brand=ucpress&amp;anchor.id=d0e6237#X note 12 to page 181]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Chateau Versailles Galerie des Glaces.jpg|thumb|Hall of Mirrors, Palace of Versailles]]

The '''Hall of Mirrors''' ({{lang-fr|Grande Galerie}} or {{lang|fr|Galerie des Glaces}}) is the central gallery of the [[Palace of Versailles]] in [[Versailles (city)|Versailles, France]]. Within the hall, the German Empire was declared in 1871 (Deutsche Reichsgründung)&lt;ref name=ParisDigest&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.parisdigest.com/versailles/hall-of-mirrors.htm |title=Hall of Mirrors facts |author= | year=2018 |publisher=Paris Digest |accessdate=2018-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Treaty of Versailles]] signed by the victorious powers of [[World War I]] in 1919.

As the principal and most remarkable feature of King [[Louis XIV of France]]'s third building campaign of the [[Palace of Versailles]] (1678–1684), construction of the Hall of Mirrors began in 1678.&lt;ref name="Kimball-1940"&gt;Fiske Kimball, "Mansart and LeBrun and the Genesis of the Grand Galerie de Versailles." ''The Art Bulletin'' volume 22, (March 1940): 1–6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Marie-1968"&gt;Alfred Marie, ''Naissance de Versailles.'' (Paris: Édition Vincet, Feal &amp; Cie, 1968).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Marie-1972"&gt;Alfred and Jeanne Marie, ''Mansart à Versailles.'' (Paris: Editions Jacques Freal, 1972).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nolhac-1901"&gt;Pierre de Nolhac, ''La Création de Versailles.'' (Versailles: L. Bernard, 1901).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nolhac-1925"&gt;Pierre de Nolhac, ''Versailles, Résidence de Louis XIV.'' (Paris: Louis Conrad, 1925).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Verlet-1945"&gt;Pierre Verlet, ''Le Mobilier royal Français.'' (Paris: 1945).&lt;/ref&gt;  To provide for the Hall of Mirrors as well as the ''salon de la guerre'' and the ''salon de la paix'', which connect the ''grand appartement du roi'' with the ''grand appartement de la reine'', architect [[Jules Hardouin Mansart]] appropriated three rooms from each apartment as well as the terrace that separated the two apartments.&lt;ref name="Marie-1968"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Marie-1972"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Verlet-1985a"&gt;Pierre Verlet, ''Le château de Versailles.'' (Paris: Librairie Arthème Fayard, 1985).&lt;/ref&gt;

The principal feature of this hall is the seventeen mirror-clad arches that reflect the seventeen arcaded windows that overlook the gardens. Each arch contains twenty-one mirrors with a total complement of 357 used in the decoration of the ''galerie des glaces''.&lt;ref name="Verlet-1985a"/&gt; The arches themselves are fixed between marble pilasters whose capitals depict the symbols of France. {{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} These gilded bronze capitals include the fleur-de-lys and the Gallic cockerel or rooster. Many of the other attributes of the Hall of Mirrors were lost to war for financial purposes, such as the silver table pieces and [[Guéridon|''guéridons,'']] which were melted by order of Louis XIV in 1689 to finance the [[Nine Years' War|War of the League of Augsburg]].&lt;ref name="Verlet-1985a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dangeau-1854"&gt;Marquis de Dangeau, (1854). ''Journal avec les additions inedites du duc de Saint-Simon'', vol. 3 (1689–1692) (Paris: Firmin Didot Freres, 1854).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cosnac-1984"&gt;Gabriel-Jules, comte de Cosnac, ''Mémoires du marquis de Sourches sur le règne de Louis XIV'', (Paris: Librairie Hachette et Cie, 1984).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mercure-1682-86"&gt;''Mercure galant''. (December 1682; September 1686; December 1686).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Construction ==

[[Image:Versailleshallofmirrors.jpg|thumb|upright|Gilded sculptured ''guéridons'' were commissioned to replace part of the silver furniture melted in 1689 to finance the War of the League of Augsburg.]]

In the 17th century,  [[mirror]]s were among the most expensive items to possess at the time; the [[Venetian Republic]] held the monopoly on the manufacture of mirrors. In order to maintain the integrity of his philosophy of [[mercantilism]], which required that all items used in the decoration of Versailles be made in France, [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert]] enticed several workers from Venice to make mirrors at the [[Manufacture royale de glaces de miroirs]]. According to legend, in order to keep its monopoly, the government of the Venetian Republic sent agents to France to poison the workers whom Colbert had brought to France.&lt;ref name="Verlet-1985a"/&gt;

The Hall of Mirrors' dimensions are 73.0&amp;nbsp;m × 10.5&amp;nbsp;m × 12.3&amp;nbsp;m (Length x Width x Height) (239.5&amp;nbsp;ft × 34.4&amp;nbsp;ft × 40.4&amp;nbsp;ft) and is flanked by the ''salon de la guerre'' (north) and the ''salon de la paix'' (south). Construction on the ''galerie'' and its two salons continued until 1684, at which time it was pressed into use for court and state functions. The ceiling decoration is dedicated to the political policies and military victories of Louis XIV. The central panel of the ceiling, ''Le roi gouverne par lui-même'' ("The king governs alone"), alludes to the establishment of the personal reign of Louis XIV in 1661. The present decorative schema represents the last of three that were presented to Louis XIV. The original decorative plan was to have depicted the exploits of [[Apollo]], being consistent with the imagery associated with the Sun-King, Louis XIV. However, when the king learned that his brother, [[Philippe I, Duke of Orléans]], had commissioned [[Pierre Mignard]] to decorate the ceiling of the ''grande galerie'' of his brother's residence at [[Château de Saint-Cloud]], Louis XIV rejected the plan. The next decorative plan was one in which the exploits of [[Hercules]] — as allegories to the actions of Louis XIV — were to be depicted. Again, as with the first plan, the Hercules theme was rejected by the king. The final plan represents military victories of Louis XIV starting with the [[Treaty of the Pyrenees]] (1659) to the [[Treaty of Nijmegen]] (1678–1679). In a departure from the decoration of the ceilings in the ''grand appartement du roi'', Le Brun has depicted Louis XIV directly, and has ceased to refer to the king in allegorical guises. In this way, themes such as good governance and military prowess are rendered with Louis XIV himself as the key figure.&lt;ref name="Marie-1972"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Verlet-1985a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Montague-1992"&gt;Jenifer Montagu, "Le Brun's Early Designs for the Grand Galerie: some comments on the drawings". ''Gazette des Beaux-Arts'' 6 pér., tome 120 (November 1992): 195–206.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Functions ==

During the 17th century, the Hall of Mirrors was used daily by Louis XIV when he walked from his private apartment to the chapel. At this time, courtiers assembled to watch the king and members of the royal family pass, and might make a particular request by intoning: "Sire, Marly?".&lt;ref name="Solnon-1987"&gt;Jean-François Solnon, (1987). ''La Cour de France'', (Paris: Fayard, 1987).&lt;/ref&gt; This was the manner in which one was able to obtain a much sought-after invitation to one of the king's house parties at [[Marly-le-Roi]], the villa Louis XIV built north of Versailles on the route to [[Saint-Germain-en-Laye]]. However, of all the events that transpired in this room during the reign of Louis XIV, the [[Siamese embassy to France (1686)|Siamese Embassy]] of 1685–1686 must be cited as the most opulent.&lt;ref name="Dangeau-1854"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bluche-1986"&gt;François Bluche, ''Louis XIV'', Paris: Arthème Fayard, 1986).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cruysse-1991"&gt;Dirk Van der Cruysse, (1991). ''Louis XIV et le Siam'', (Paris: Arthème Fayard, 1991).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mercure-1686"&gt;''Mercure galant''. (September 1686; December 1686).&lt;/ref&gt; At this time, the ''galerie des glaces'' and the ''grands appartements'' were still appointed with silver furniture. In its heyday, over 3,000 candles were used to light the Hall of Mirrors. In February 1715, Louis XIV held his last embassy in the ''galerie des glaces'', one in which he received Mehemet Reza Bey, [[ambassador]] of the Shah of [[Persia]].&lt;ref name="Bluche-1986"/&gt;

In the successive reigns of [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]] and [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]], the Hall of Mirrors continued to serve for family and court functions. Embassies, births, and marriages were fêted in this room; however, perhaps the most celebrated event of the 18th century occurred on 25 February 1745: the celebrated ''bal des Ifs'' (Ball of the Yew Trees). It was during this costume ball that Louis XV, who was dressed as a [[taxus|yew]] tree, met Jeanne-Antoinette Poisson d'Étiolles, who was costumed as [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]], goddess of the hunt. Jeanne-Antoinette, who became Louis XV's mistress, is better known to history as the [[Marquise de Pompadour]].&lt;ref name="Marie-1984"&gt;Alfred Marie, ''Versailles au temps de Louis XV'', (Paris: Imprimerie National, 1984).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nolhac-1926"&gt;Pierre de Nolhac, ''Versailles au XVIIIe siècle'', (Paris: Louis Conard, 1926).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th century, at the conclusion of the [[Franco-Prussian War]], the Prussian king, [[Wilhelm I, German Emperor|William I]], was declared German emperor — thus establishing the [[German Empire]] — on 18 January 1871 in the Hall of Mirrors by Bismarck and the victorious German princes and lords. This was seen as a victory with heavy symbolism for the Germans and a stinging insult for the defeated French.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} French Prime Minister [[Georges Clemenceau|Clemenceau]] chose the Hall of Mirrors as the location wherein was signed the [[Treaty of Versailles]] that ended World War I on 28 June 1919.

The Hall of Mirrors is still used for state occasions of the [[French Fifth Republic|Fifth Republic]], such as receptions for visiting heads of state.

'''''Hoepla''''' ("Whoops") was a Dutch experimental cultural television show broadcast in 1967. It aimed at a young teenage audience and was notable for being unpredictable and risky in its subject matter, featuring reports, performances, declarations, and interviews that tied in with the subversive atmosphere of the [[Provo (movement)|Provo]] movement. Three episodes were made for the [[VPRO]], and the show caused national controversy when a naked woman, [[Phil Bloom]] appeared on the show, being the first time this happened on Dutch television.{{efn|Critics differentiate between the brief nudity in ''Hoepla'', characterized by its inactivity, and the first scene involving a naked actress ([[Pleuni Touw]]) acting: that occurred in 1974's ''[[De Stille Kracht (TV series)|De Stille Kracht]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nieuws.nl/binnenland/20111223/Eerste-naaktscene-televisie-online-te-bekijken|title=Eerste naaktscène televisie online te bekijken|date=23 December 2011|publisher=Nieuws.nl|language=Dutch|accessdate=2 September 2013}}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;}} A fourth episode was taped but did not air until 2008. The show was written and produced by the team of [[Wim T. Schippers]], [[Wim van der Linden]], [[Willem de Ridder]], and [[Hans Verhagen]].

==Background==
''Hoepla'' was made by and for a teenage audience (the post-World War II generation), at a time (the early 1960s) when Dutch culture was one of "boredom and obedience". That segment of the population had already clashed with the establishment over a [[Omroepvereniging VARA|VARA]] television show that ran from 1963 to 1966, ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Zo is het toevallig ook nog eens een keer|nl}}'', "the most despised and controversial satirical TV program ever". That show, based on the BBC program ''[[That Was the Week That Was]]'', had aired a parody of the [[Lord's Prayer]] ("Give us this day our daily television"), on 4 January 1964, in a skit called "Beeldreligie" ("image worship") which led to criticism from television viewers and politicians; questions were asked in parliament, and one of the show's presenters, the wildly popular and by no means rebellious [[Mies Bouwman]], was forced to resign from the show after receiving threats. Police were called in to protect the studio during subsequent tapings.&lt;ref name="toevallig"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geschiedenis24.nl/andere-tijden/afleveringen/2001-2002/Zo-is-het-toevallig-ook-nog-s-een-keer.html|last=Nijland|first=Yfke|title=''Zo is het toevallig ook nog 's een keer''|publisher=Geschiedenis 24|language=Dutch|accessdate=22 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like ''Zo is het toevallig'', ''Hoepla'' would tackle controversial topics such as "the colonial past, the royal family, and sexuality" in a social system where "authority and community were central".&lt;ref&gt;Beunders 310.&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Hoepla''==
According to [[Hans Verhagen]], one of ''Hoepla''{{'}}s writers and directors, the show was intended to operate on a "wavelength" which had hitherto not been tried on television.&lt;ref name=crone157/&gt; That ''Hoepla'' was in tune with happening developments in popular culture was indicated by its guest list: musical performances were given by some of the era's hippest artists, including [[Soft Machine]] (episode 2), [[The Mothers of Invention]] (ep. 2), and [[The Jimi Hendrix Experience]] (ep. 3),&lt;ref&gt;Mourits 69.&lt;/ref&gt; and there were declarations by and interviews with such idols as [[Eric Clapton]] and [[Mick Jagger]]. The Experience performed "[[Foxy Lady]]", "Catfish Blues", and "[[Purple Haze]]" in the studio on 10 November 1967, before playing an evening show in Rotterdam; that rendition of "Catfish Blues" was reissued on the 1994 compilation album ''[[Blues (Jimi Hendrix album)|Blues]]''.&lt;ref&gt;McDermott, Kramer, and Cox 77.&lt;/ref&gt; (The section with "Foxy Lady" appears to be lost, and might have been stolen from the archive by a Hendrix fan.)&lt;ref name="4teruggevonden"/&gt;

===First episode===
The first episode aired on 28 July 1967 and immediately redrew the earlier battle lines familiar from the "Beeldreligie" controversy. Opposition against the show was mobilized by the national daily newspaper ''[[De Telegraaf]]'', who had complained earlier that ''Zo is het toevallig'' was a waste of the public's [[television licence]], and published pictures of the cast and crew of ''Zo is het toevallig'' to accompany its coverage of ''Hoepla'', to remind its audience of what was at stake.&lt;ref name=crone157&gt;Crone 157.&lt;/ref&gt; Notable sections of the show included an interview of [[Pete Townshend]] by Hans Verhagen&lt;ref&gt;Neill and Kent 117.&lt;/ref&gt; and the appearance of [[Phil Bloom]], naked except for a strategically placed garland of plastic flowers, during a performance by the singer [[Teddy Lee J.]] (a 25-year-old singer from [[Suriname]])&lt;ref&gt;Verhagen 24.&lt;/ref&gt; who sang "I'm a sexman"&lt;ref name="4teruggevonden"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geschiedenis24.nl/nieuws/2008/januari/Hoepla-4-teruggevonden.html|title=Hoepla 4 teruggevonden!|publisher=Geschiedenis 24|language=Dutch|accessdate=22 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Verhagen paid Bloom 150 guilders for her work, and the VPRO lost 67 members.&lt;ref name="4teruggevonden"/&gt;

===Second episode===
For the second episode, the writers had upped the ante, and got Phil Bloom to appear completely naked. During a skit, she is reading a newspaper, sitting on a sofa; she reads, out loud, a review of the first episode of ''Hoepla'' that appeared in the Catholic daily ''[[Trouw]]'' and when she lowers the newspaper she is shown to be completely naked. But when photos of the taping leaked out and were published, the scene was shot again; this time Bloom is on a chair (likewise naked) reading another ''Hoepla'' article, this time from ''[[Het Vrije Volk]]'', the social-democrat daily paper, which states that the VPRO cut Bloom's scene after the photos leaked out. As soon as the scene is over, the screen shows the VPRO's postal address, to accommodate those who wished to cancel their membership.&lt;ref name="eerst"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geschiedenis24.nl/nieuws/2007/oktober/Voor-het-eerst-te-zien-een-blote-Phil-Bloom-in-de-eerste-aflevering-van-Hoepla.html|title=Voor het eerst te zien: een blote Phil Bloom in de eerste aflevering van Hoepla|date=13 October 2007|publisher=Geschiedenis 24|language=Dutch|accessdate=22 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reactions were predictable: ''Telegraaf'' columnist Leo Riemens referred to the show as "filth" and "pornography", and letters to the various editors struck the same chords. Other newspapers, though, were more positive, and the commentary in parliament by SGP representative C. N. van Dis (the [[Reformed Political Party|Staatkundig Gereformeerde Partij]] is a small, orthodox, Calvinist party), who strongly criticized the Minister of Culture [[Marga Klompé]] for allowing women to be degraded, did not meet with approval in parliament or the press.&lt;ref&gt;Crone 157-59.&lt;/ref&gt; The VPRO anticipated angry letters from some of its members, and had prepared a standard reply in which the organization said it understood that not everyone would agree with the show's message, but that it wanted to be an "open organization" which could adjust to the rapidly changing attitudes toward society's norms.&lt;ref&gt;Crone 159-60.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Third episode===
The third episode was taped on 10 November 1967 but did not air until 23 November, minus two controversial items that the VPRO cut: a section called "Vleesch" (an old-fashioned spelling for "vlees", "meat"), which reported on the last five minutes in an abattoir of a cow's life, and a section in which a model performs a striptease over an audio tape of Dutch prime minister [[Piet de Jong]],&lt;ref name="eerst"/&gt; responding to the questions asked in parliament by C. N. van Dis about ''Hoepla''&lt;ref name="4teruggevonden"/&gt; The "Vleesch" section had been moved from the second to the third episode; after a committee of child psychiatrists had delved into the matter, it was approved as safe for children but was again moved, to the fourth episode, which never aired. The section was conceived by Hans Verhagen and vegetarian Wim T.

===Fourth episode===
A fourth episode was supposed to air on 8 January 1968 (and apparently a record number of people had tuned in to watch it),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geschiedenis24.nl/nieuws/2012/oktober/Phil-Bloom-was-al-bloot-in-de-eerste-aflevering-van-Hoepla-.html|title=Voor het eerst te zien: een blote Phil Bloom in de eerste aflevering van Hoepla|date=8 October 2012|publisher=Geschiedenis 24|language=Dutch|accessdate=22 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it was decided on that very day to cancel it, with the explanation given that Phil Bloom had been photographed by ''[[Playboy]]'' during rehearsals, and such commercial ventures were not allowed on public television.&lt;ref name="eerst"/&gt; The VPRO told the show's makers on 15 January that there would be no more new episodes. The tapes for the fourth episode were discovered early in the 21st century, unedited; they were newly edited and aired in January 2008.&lt;ref name="4teruggevonden"/&gt;

Articles in [[List of economics journals|economics journals]] are usually classified according to the '''JEL classification codes''', a system originated by the ''[[Journal of Economic Literature]]''.  The ''JEL'' is published quarterly by the [[American Economic Association]] (AEA) and contains survey articles and information on recently published books and dissertations. The AEA maintains [[EconLit]], a searchable data base of citations for articles, books, reviews, dissertations, and working papers classified by JEL codes for the years from 1969. A recent addition to EconLit is indexing of economics-journal articles from 1886 to 1968&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aeaweb.org/econlit/index.php EconLit – American Economic Association].&lt;/ref&gt; parallel to the print series ''Index of Economic Articles''.&lt;ref&gt;Works cited in the ''Index of Economic Articles'' are classified by author and subject. Coverage includes v. 1-7 for 1886–1965 and v. 8-36 for each year thereafter to 1996 (per Baylor University Libraries, "International Business Sources," [http://www.baylor.edu/content/services/document.php/14779.pdf p. 1]).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
;There are 20 primary JEL categories:&lt;ref name="AEA-JEL-2017"&gt;{{cite web|title=JEL Classification System / EconLit Subject Descriptors|url=https://www.aeaweb.org/econlit/jelCodes.php?view=jel|website=American Economic Association|publisher=American Economic Association|accessdate=1 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;:

;JEL Subcategories{{ref|Alpha|[α]}}:
Each JEL primary category has secondary and tertiary subcategories, for example, under JEL: D – Microeconomics:
:JEL: D1 – Household Behavior and Family Economics
::JEL: D11 – Consumer Economics: Theory&lt;ref&gt;An alphabetic list of category links constructed as corresponding JEL-code (sub)categories and listed below is at [[:Category:Categories which are included in the JEL classification codes]].&lt;/ref&gt;
JEL code (sub)categories, including periodic updates, are referenced at [https://web.archive.org/web/20100405035000/http://www.aeaweb.org/journal/jel_class_system.php Journal of Economic Literature (JEL) Classification System].  Links to definitions of (sub)categories are at [http://www.aeaweb.org/jel/guide/jel.php JEL Classification Codes Guide] with corresponding examples of article titles linked to publication information, such as [[Abstract (summary)|abstracts]].

==Purpose==
Articles in economics journals also list JEL codes (for example [[#JEL: B|JEL: B12]]), facilitating their use across [[search engine]]s. Comprehensive uses of JEL (sub)classifications include:
:• ''[[The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics]]'', 2008, v. 8, Appendix IV, pp. 854–69, and for the online version by drilling to the primary, secondary, or tertiary JEL code of interest  [http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/advanced_search here] and pressing the Search button below it for article-preview links .

==Notes==
:{{note|Alpha|α}} JEL codes A through Z denote primary categories (e.g. '''''D''' Microeconomics''). Secondary categories are specified by an additional Arabic numeral (e.g. ''D'''3''' Distribution''), tertiary categories by a following second Arabic numeral (e.g. ''D3'''0''' General''). Articles in economics publications use JEL codes in this manner: ''JEL: B12''.
:{{note|Beta|β}} Developed in the context of the [[Journal of Economic Literature]], the JEL classification system became a standard method of classifying economics literature, including journal articles, books, collective volume articles, dissertations, working papers in economics, book reviews from the ''Journal of Economic Literature'', and [[EconLit]].&lt;ref name="AEA-JEL-2017"/&gt;

'''''Kilburn Appellant v Estate Kilburn Respondent''''',&lt;ref&gt;1931 AD 501.&lt;/ref&gt; an important case in [[South Africa]]n [[South African property law|property]] [[South African law|law]], was heard in the Appellate Division&lt;ref&gt;Wessels ACJ, Stratford JA, Roos JA and Hutton AJA.&lt;/ref&gt; on 15 and 29 September, [[1931 in South Africa|1931]].

== Facts ==
For a [[mortgage]] to be valid, there must be a legal or natural obligation to which the [[hypothecation]] is accessory. In ''Kilburn'', a husband had, before his [[marriage]], passed and registered a [[notarial bond]] for £500 as a second charge on all his property in favour of his wife.

== Judgment ==
The court found as a fact that, although the bond purported to secure a sum of £500 which the husband had verbally promised to pay his wife, it was not a serious promise, and there was therefore no intention to pay that sum. The intention of the spouses, in agreeing to the notarial bond, was only to give a preferential claim on the sum if the husband were to be declared [[insolvency|insolvent]].

The principal debt was invalid, and so, in turn, was the notarial bond. As, therefore, there was no legal obligation secured by the bond, the wife could not, on the insolvency of her husband, claim in a ''[[concursus creditorum]]'' on the bond. The decision of the court ''a quo'' (in the [[KwaZulu-Natal|Natal]] Provincial Division) in ''Kilburn v Estate Kilburn'' was thus confirmed.

'''Kukeri''' ({{lang-bg|кукери}}; singular: '''kuker''', кукер) are elaborately costumed [[Bulgaria]]n men, and sometimes women, who perform traditional rituals intended to scare away evil spirits. Closely related traditions are found throughout the [[Balkans]] and [[Greece]] (including [[Romania]] and the [[Pontus (region)|Pontus]]). The costumes cover most of the body and include decorated wooden masks of animals (sometimes double-faced) and large [[Bell (instrument)|bell]]s attached to the belt.  Around [[New Year]] and before [[Lent]], the kukeri walk and dance through villages to scare away evil spirits with their costumes and the sound of their bells. They are also believed to provide a good harvest, health, and happiness to the village during the year.

The kukeri traditionally visit peoples' houses at night so that "the sun would not catch them on the road."{{cn|date=May 2015}}  After parading around the village they usually gather at the village square to dance wildly and amuse the people. Kukeri rituals vary by region but remain largely the same in essence.
[[File:Kuker from the village of Kosharevo, Bulgaria.png|thumb|Kuker from the village of Kosharevo, Bulgaria]]
==Distribution==
The custom is generally thought to be related to the Thracian [[Dionysos]] cult in the wider area of [[Thracia]].
Similar rituals can be also found in much of the Balkans.&lt;ref name="Kernbach"&gt;Kernbach, Victor (1989). ''Dicţionar de Mitologie Generală''. Bucureşti: Editura Ştiinţifică şi Enciclopedică. {{ISBN|973-29-0030-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 
The name ''kuker'' has been derived from Latin ''cuculla'' meaning "hood, cowl" or ''cucurum'', "[[quiver]]" (i.e. in the sense of a container; an abbreviation of ''koukouros geros'').&lt;ref&gt;W. Puchner, ''Studien zur Volkskunde Südosteuropas und des mediterranen Raums'', 2009, [https://books.google.ch/books?id=4wRZda1E3nsC&amp;pg=PA180 p. 180 fn. 32].&lt;/ref&gt; 

The corresponding figure in Greek-speaking Thrace is known as ''Kalogeros'' "rod-carrier", also shortened to ''cuci'', in former Yugoslavia known as ''didi, didici'', in Bulgaria as ''kuker'' or ''babushar'', as ''momogeros'' in Pontic Anatolia. In Romania, this figure mostly appears together with a goat, known as ''capra'', ''turca'' or ''brezaia''.&lt;ref&gt;W. Puchner, ''Studien zur Volkskunde Südosteuropas und des mediterranen Raums'', 2009, [https://books.google.ch/books?id=4wRZda1E3nsC&amp;pg=PA276 p. 276].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kukeri==
Kukeri is a divinity personifying fecundity, sometimes in Bulgaria and Serbia it is a plural divinity. In Bulgaria, a ritual spectacle of spring (a sort of [[carnival]]) takes place after a scenario of folk theatre, in which Kuker's role is interpreted by a man attired in a sheep- or goat-pelt, wearing a horned mask and girded with a large wooden [[phallus]]. During the ritual, various physiological acts are interpreted, including the sexual act, as a symbol of the god's sacred marriage, while the symbolical wife, appearing pregnant, mimes the pains of giving birth. This ritual inaugurates the labours of the fields ([[ploughing]], [[sowing]]) and is carried out with the participation of numerous allegorical personages, among which is the Emperor and his entourage.&lt;ref name="Kernbach"/&gt;

==Capra==
Capra comes from the Danish words kahmpu (To wear upon the head) and rah (The divine light). A halo like head piece was worn as a crown to symbolize the spiritual divine realm. While animal fur, bird feathers and the sort were worn to symbolize nature. The fact that nature has good and evil, and that humans are the intermediary between spirit and nature. It was a time to pay homage to the Spieth gods. Some cultures imbibed in human flesh to satiate the gods thirst for blood, as an act of solidarity for the gods.

==Kukeri in the media==
Kukeri or Kuker Warriors are some of the main characters in the epic fantasy animated series 'The Golden Apple' which is currently being developed by Studio Zmei. In it, young brothers Bran and Vlad have been trained as Kuker Warriors to fight evil spirits but they have to question what they have been taught when they are forced to team up with half-spirit Vihra and Samodiva-spirit Tina in order to protect their world. &lt;ref&gt;https://goldenappleseries.com/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/the-golden-apple-animated-series-pilot-episode-fantasy-animation#/&lt;/ref&gt;

Kukeri are featured in the music video for the song "[[Fish on]]", by the [[industrial metal]] band [[Lindemann (band)|Lindemann]], and in the movie ''[[Toni Erdmann]]'', directed by [[Maren Ade]].

'''''La Grande Encyclopédie, inventaire raisonné des sciences, des lettres, et des arts''''' (''The Great Encyclopedia: a systematic inventory of science, letters, and the arts'') is a 31-volume [[encyclopedia]] published in [[France]] from 1886 to 1902 by H. Lamirault, and later by the société anonyme de la grande encyclopédie (Grande Encyclopédie Company).

The general secretaries of its editorial board were [[Ferdinand-Camille Dreyfus]] and [[André Berthelot]].

Major articles are signed and include a bibliography. In its 31 volumes of 1200 pages each, there are about 200,000 articles, 15,000 engraved illustrations and 200 maps.

'''From the Preface:'''
{{Cquote|''Despite numerous attempts, some of which were crowned with success in their time, France still does not have a great encyclopedic work, popular yet up-to-date with the latest progress of science....''

''The Grande Encyclopedie is a work of high popularization (haute vulgarisation).  It presents the current state of modern knowledge, arranging a collection of the human knowledge of our time.''

''Staying above current disputes, resolute in not becoming a partisan tool, the Grande Encyclopedie has no rule other than the impartiality of science.''

''...It sets out facts with scrupulous precision, and diverse or contradictory theories with impartiality: it is up to the reader to compare them and reach conclusions.''}}

In the article "Encyclopédie":
{{cquote|''Since the publication of the ''[[Encyclopédie]]'', no comparable work had been published, except in England.  In 1882, a group of scholars and men of letters, at the initiative of Camille Dreyfus and the publisher Baer, undertook to fill this lacuna.  At first, it was just a matter of an undertaking such as that of [[Brockhaus Enzyklopädie|Brockhaus]] and of [[Appletons' Cyclopædia of American Biography|Appleton]].  But soon the plan was enlarged by Mr. Dreyfus, in agreement with the directors, to the scale of a true encyclopedia.''}}

According to the [[Library of Congress]] catalog record, the individual volumes were published in the following years: 1-2: 1886, 3-4: 1887, 4: 1887, 5-6: 1888, 7-8: 1889, 8: 1889, 9-11: 1890, 12-13: 1891, 14-16: 1892, 17-18: 1893, 19-20: 1894, 21: 1895, 22: 1896, 23: 1898, 24-26: 1899, 27-8: 1900, 29-30: 1901, 31: 1902.

'''Lexin''' is an online [[Swedish language|Swedish]] and [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] lexicon that can translate between Swedish or Norwegian and a number of other languages. Its original use was to help [[immigrants]] translate between their native languages and Swedish, but at least the English-Swedish-English lexicons are so complete that many Swedes use them for everyday use. 
==Swedish==
The Swedish lexicons are now called ''Folkets lexikon'' (The People's Dictionary) and support bidirectional translation between Swedish and:

The '''Liberties of the Tower''', or the '''Tower Liberty''', was a [[Liberty (division)|liberty]] around and including the [[Tower of London]].

It was outside the jurisdiction of the [[City of London]] and the [[Middlesex|County of Middlesex]], with its own county government. The area of the liberty expanded in 1686. It became part of the [[County of London]] in 1889 and was dissolved in 1894.

==History==
The [[liberty (division)|liberty]] originally consisted of the area inside the walls of the Tower of London (also known as [[Tower of London (parish)|Tower Within]]) and immediately outside it (known as [[Old Tower Without]]). The boundaries were presented by a Leet Jury in 1525 and again as surveyed by Haiward and Gascoyne in 1597.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=63345#s6|title=Tower Chambers - Traitors' Bridge - ''A Dictionary of London'' (1918)|website=www.british-history.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1686 [[letters patent]] granted by [[James II of England|James II]] added the [[Old Artillery Ground]], [[Minories|Little Minories]] and the [[Liberty of Wellclose]]. These areas came into the possession of the Crown when the religious houses that formerly administered them were [[Dissolution of the Monasteries|dissolved]]. They had subsequently been used for the storing of ordnance.

The population was 3,995 in 1811 and 4,190 in 1831.&lt;ref&gt;Accounts and Papers, Eighteen Volumes, 17, Relating to Assessed Taxes, Poor, &amp;c, Vol. XLIV , (1832)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Governance==
[[File:Stepney Met. B Ward Map 1916.svg|thumb|A map showing the Tower ward of Stepney Metropolitan Borough as it appeared in 1916.]]
The liberties had an administration separate from the neighbouring county and city, headed by the [[Constable of the Tower of London]], and appointed their own coroner, and had their own courthouse with general and [[quarter sessions]] and gaol. A force of constables was appointed for the area. The inhabitants had certain other privileges such as being able to claim any beast that fell from, and any swans under [[London Bridge]].

From 1837 the liberty formed part of the Whitechapel Poor Law Union. Extra-parochial places were progressively eliminated and following the [[Extra-Parochial Places Act 1857]], the [[Tower of London (parish)|Tower of London]] and [[Old Tower Without]] became civil parishes in 1858. The Old Artillery Ground became a civil parish in 1866, following the [[Poor Law Amendment Act 1866]].

From 1855 the area became part of the [[Whitechapel District (Metropolis)|Whitechapel District]] and was administered by the Whitechapel District Board of Works.  The liberty became part of the [[County of London]] in 1889.&lt;ref&gt;F. A. Youngs, ''Guide to Local Administrative Units of England'', Volume I, London 1979&lt;/ref&gt;

==Abolition==
By 1889 the liberty had become obsolete and it was thought that the [[Local Government Act 1888]] had removed the jurisdiction of the justices. However, the charter was found to be still in operation.&lt;ref&gt;TOWER OF LONDON, Star, Issue 5033, 20 August 1894, Page 3&lt;/ref&gt; The liberty was abolished on 25 June 1894 following a petition by the justices of the peace of the County of London under the [[Liberties Act 1850]].&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=26511 |date=11 May 1894 |pages=2769–2770 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The area of the former liberty was included in the [[Metropolitan Borough of Stepney]] in 1900.

The liberty continued as a franchise [[coroner|coroner's district]]. [[Coroners Act|The Coroners (Amendment) Act 1926]] provided that when a vacancy arises the district could be dissolved and when a vacancy occurred on 10 May 1939 an order was made on 30 November 1939 combining it with the east district, coming into effect on 1 January 1940.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/34754/pages/8326/page.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The area of the former liberty now forms part of the [[London Borough of Tower Hamlets]] and following boundary changes around the Minories in 1994 is partly in the [[City of London]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1993/1445/contents/made|title=The City and London Borough Boundaries Order 1993|website=www.legislation.gov.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[H. Rider Haggard]], [[Order of the British Empire|KBE]] ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|æ|g|ər|d}}; 1856 – 1925) was an English writer, largely of [[adventure fiction]], but also of non-fiction. The eighth child of a [[Norfolk]] barrister and squire,&lt;ref name="Times: Obit" /&gt; through family connections he gained employment with [[Henry Bulwer, 1st Baron Dalling and Bulwer|Sir Henry Bulwer]] during the latter's service as lieutenant-governor of [[Colony of Natal|Natal]], South Africa.{{sfn|Cohen|2004}} Rider Haggard travelled to southern Africa in 1875 and remained in the country for six years, during which time he served as Master of the High Court of the [[Transvaal Colony|Transvaal]] and an adjutant of the [[Pretoria Horse]].&lt;ref name="Times: Obit" /&gt;

Rider Haggard's time in Africa proved inspirational for him,&lt;ref name="Gage CA" /&gt; and while still in Natal he wrote two articles for ''[[The Gentleman's Magazine]]'' describing his experiences.{{sfn|McKay|1930|p=81}} He returned to Britain in 1881 and was [[called to the bar]]; while studying he wrote his first book, ''[[Cetywayo and His White Neighbours]]'', a critical examination of Britain's policies in South Africa.{{sfn|Cohen|2004}} Two years later he published his first work of fiction, ''[[Dawn (Rider Haggard novel)|Dawn]]''. In 1885 he wrote one of his most popular novels, ''[[King Solomon's Mines]]''—detailing the life of the adventurer [[Allan Quatermain]]—which was followed by ''[[She: A History of Adventure]]'' (1886), which introduced the female character Ayesha, both of which became series of books;{{efn|Ayesha was a beautiful sorceress who had discovered the secret of eternal life. She is described by ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of British Literature'' as being "a femme fatale", who is "an unattainable and yet eternally faithful lover, at once ravishing, dangerous, magical, all-powerful".{{sfn|Brantlinger|2006|p=496}}}} according to the author [[Morton N. Cohen]], writing for the ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'', much of Rider Haggard's reputation rests on these two works.{{sfn|Cohen|2004}} Although he mostly concentrated on his non-fiction and his novels, he also produced a number of short-stories, which have been released in three collections.&lt;ref name="Gage CA" /&gt;

Rider Haggard was interested in land affairs and wrote several works on the subject; in 1895 he served on a government commission to examine [[The Salvation Army|Salvation Army]] labour colonies, and in 1911 he served on the [[Royal Commission]] examining coastal erosion. He was an inveterate letter writer to ''[[The Times]]'', and had nearly 100 letters published by the newspaper.&lt;ref name="Times: Obit" /&gt;{{sfn|Cohen|2004}}

'''Memorandum of conversation''' (abbrev.: '''MEMCON''') and also '''memorandum of a conversation''' and '''memo to the file''' refers to a method of contemporaneous documentation of a conversation in the form of a [[memorandum]] used by the [[federal government of the United States|United States federal government]].&lt;Ref name=memcon /&gt;&lt;Ref name=memfile /&gt;

''[[The Weekly Standard]]'' characterized the use of the tactic in the U.S. government as among "the most basic ways of Washington".&lt;ref name=memfile /&gt;

==Method==
Typically an individual will document the events of the conversation as soon as possible after the occurrence.&lt;ref name=memcon /&gt; All material statements and discussed items are quoted and described as accurately as possible soon after the discussion and filed for future reference.&lt;ref name=memcon&gt;{{citation|first=Lawrence|last=O'Donnell|authorlink=Lawrence O'Donnell|work=[[The Last Word with Lawrence O'Donnell]]|publisher=[[MSNBC]]|date=May 16, 2017|title=MEMCON}}&lt;/ref&gt; Memcons function as documentation of historical events, such as conversations between heads of state and law enforcement officials.&lt;ref name=ford&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.fordlibrarymuseum.gov/library/guides/findingaid/Memoranda_of_Conversations.asp|title=Summary Description|work=National Security Adviser. Memoranda of Conversations, 1973-1977|publisher=[[Gerald R. Ford Presidential Library and Museum]]|access-date=May 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specific developments discussed, the time of the meeting, location, and individuals in attendance are all documented in-depth within the memo.&lt;ref name=memcon /&gt;&lt;ref name=memfile&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.weeklystandard.com/a-brief-history-of-the-memo-to-the-file/article/2008086|first=Eric|last=Felten|title=A Brief History of the 'Memo to the File'|date=May 17, 2017|work=[[The Weekly Standard]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[United States Department of Justice]] attorneys and [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] [[special agent]]s commonly make use of memoranda of conversation.&lt;ref name=memcon /&gt; A majority of intermediate-rank managerial staff and bureaucrats within the U.S. federal government consistently make use of the method. The creation of a memorandum of understanding allows federal employees to memorialize and keep a record of their conversations and transactions.&lt;ref name=memfile /&gt;

Memoranda to file are used in investigations in the private sector. For example, the [[fraud]] unit of a large corporation may use memoranda to file, to report individual interviews and significant telephone conversations. Generally, "the memorandum will show the name of the author, date of preparation, the case name or number, and the specific subject covered. It will also contain the detailed narrative of the event, interview, or other investigative activity described and should be written as close in time as circumstances permit to those events."&lt;ref name=sennewald&gt;{{citation|first1=Charles A.|last1= Sennewald|first2=John K.|last2= Tsukayama|title=The Process of Investigation: Concepts and Strategies for Investigators in the Private Sector|edition=4th|publisher=[[Butterworth-Heinemann]]|year=2015|pages=189-90|isbn=978-0128001660}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{wikisource|Memorandum of Conversation, by the Officer in Charge of Korean Affairs in the Office of Northeast Asian Affairs July 9, 1951}}
Former Deputy Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs and subsequently Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs, [[Brent Scowcroft]], who served as such in the U.S. presidential administration of [[Gerald R. Ford]], kept copious documentation of his meetings in the form of memorandum of conversation.&lt;ref name=ford /&gt; He would take handwritten notes, and immediately have them transcribed in typewritten format with the assistance of his staff from the [[United States National Security Council]].&lt;ref name=ford /&gt; The [[Gerald R.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1687">'''Nicolae D. Popescu''' (August 9, 1843&amp;ndash;June 8, 1921) was a [[Romania]]n prose writer.

He was born in [[Bucharest]] to [[Romanian Orthodox]] priest Dimitrie Popescu and his wife Niculina. Popescu began high school in his native city, but left early in 1861 in order to become a civil servant at the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Romania)|Foreign Ministry]], where he worked until retiring in 1913. He wrote numerous calendars starting in 1866, and also published work in ''Amicul familiei'', ''Columna lui Traian'', ''Ghimpele'', ''Revista contimporană'', ''Revista literară și științifică'', ''România ilustrată'', ''Telegraful'' and ''Vatra''. He wrote sensationalist novels, either historically themed or inspired by ballads and traditions surrounding famous ''[[hajduks]]'' and bandits. A few of his many novels include ''Radu al III-lea cel Frumos'', 1864; ''Amazoana de la Rahova'', 1879; ''Iancu Jianu'', 1880; ''Miul haiducul'', 1881; ''Tunsul haiducul'', 1881; ''Codreanu haiducu'', 1882 and ''Boierii haiduci'', 1892. As shown by their repeated republication, these were much loved by the late 19th century reading public. He also published a series of song and couplet collections, in the style of [[Anton Pann]]'s old anthologies.&lt;ref name="sasu"&gt;Aurel Sasu (ed.), ''Dicționarul biografic al literaturii române'', vol.

The '''National Film Board of Canada''' (or simply '''National Film Board''' or '''NFB''') ([[Canadian French|French]]: '''Office national du film du Canada''', or '''ONF''') is Canada's public film and [[digital media]] producer and distributor. An agency of the [[Government of Canada]], the NFB produces and distributes [[documentary film]]s, [[animation]], [[web documentaries]], and alternative dramas. In total, the NFB has produced over 13,000 productions since its inception, which have won over 5,000 awards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nfb.ca/about/ About the NFB]&lt;/ref&gt; The NFB reports to the [[Parliament of Canada]] through the [[Minister of Canadian Heritage]]. It has English-language and French-language production branches.

==Mission==
[[File:Office national du film montreal.jpg|thumb|NFB headquarters (Norman McLaren Building), [[Montreal]], [[Québec]].]]

===Partial timeline===
*1939: The government of Canada proposes the creation of a National Film Commission to complement the activities of the [[Canadian Government Motion Picture Bureau]]. The legislation stipulates that the NFB was to “make and distribute films designed to help Canadians in all parts of Canada to understand the ways of living and the problems of Canadians in other parts.” Legislation also stated that the NFB would co-ordinate the film activities of federal departments.
*1950: Canada's Parliament passes the ''National Film Act'', which states that NFB's mandate is "to produce and distribute and to promote the production and distribution of films designed to interpret Canada to Canadians and to other nations." This act also stipulates that the NFB is to engage in film research.
*1965: As a result of a report written by producer Gordon Sheppard on Canadian cultural policies and activities, the NFB began regionalizing its English production activities, with producers appointed in major cities across Canada.
*1984: Minister of Communications [[Francis Fox]] released a ''National Film and Video Policy'', which added two new elements to the mandate, with the NFB also tasked with being "a world centre of excellence in production of films and videos" and "a national training and research centre in the art and technique of film and video."
*2008: The NFB announces a Strategic Plan that includes its first digital strategy.&lt;ref name="mission timeline"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://onf-nfb.gc.ca/en/about-the-nfb/organization/mandate/|title=Mission and Highlights|date=November 18, 2015|work=Website|publisher=National Film Board of Canada|accessdate=August 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operations==
The National Film Board currently maintains its head office in [[Saint-Laurent, Quebec|Saint-Laurent]], a borough of [[Montreal]], in the [[Norman McLaren]] [[electoral district]], named in honour of the NFB animation pioneer.&lt;ref name="Saint-Laurent"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://saintlaurent.ville.montreal.qc.ca/fr/mairie/profildistricts/profildistricts.asp|title=Un territoire, deux districts électoraux|work=City of Montreal Web site|language=French|accessdate=May 16, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101107005909/http://saintlaurent.ville.montreal.qc.ca/Fr/mairie/ProfilDistricts/ProfilDistricts.asp|archivedate=November 7, 2010|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NFB HQ building is also named for McLaren, and is home to much of its production activity.

In the second quarter of 2018, the NFB is scheduled to move to its headquarters to the new Îlot Balmoral building located at Montreal's [[Quartier des spectacles]], adjacent to the {{Interlanguage link multi|Place des Festivals|fr}} square.&lt;ref&gt;http://onf-nfb.gc.ca/en/slider/nfb-headquarters-will-get-a-new-home-in-montreal-in-2018-2/&lt;/ref&gt; The NFB will occupy the first six floors of the building, which will allow it to have closer contact with the public, and will also feature expanded digital media research and production facilities.&lt;ref name="SRC"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://ici.radio-canada.ca/nouvelles/arts_et_spectacles/2014/09/25/007-siege-social-onf-montreal.shtml|title=L'ONF déménage dans le Quartier des spectacles à Montréal|date=September 25, 2014|work=CBC News|language=French|accessdate=September 26, 2014|location=Montreal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Nm toronto nfb building.jpg|thumb|The NFB's offices in Toronto. The ground-floor Mediatheque was closed in April 2012.]]
In addition to the English and French-language studios in its Montreal HQ, there are centres throughout Canada. English-language production occurs at centres in [[Toronto]] (Ontario Centre), [[Vancouver]] (Pacific &amp; Yukon Centre, located in the [[Woodward's Building]]), [[Edmonton]] (North West Centre), [[Winnipeg]] (Prairie Centre), and [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax]] (Atlantic Centre). As of October 2009, the Atlantic Centre also operates an office in [[St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador]].&lt;ref name="Wicks"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thetelegram.com/index.cfm?sid=297120&amp;sc=88|title=Digital is the future of film, television, new media, says Tom Perlmutter|last=Wicks|first=Heidi|date=October 23, 2009|work=The Telegram|location=St. John's|accessdate=October 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2011, the NFB appointed a producer to work with film and digital media makers across [[Saskatchewan]], to be based in [[Regina, Saskatchewan|Regina]].&lt;ref name=generoux&gt;{{cite news|last=Chabun|first=Will|title=Generoux to helm reborn Regina office|url=https://leaderpost.com/entertainment/movie-guide/Generoux+helm+reborn+Regina+office/4848175/story.html|accessdate=June 12, 2011|newspaper=[[Regina Leader-Post]]|date=May 27, 2011}}{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Outside Quebec, French language productions are also made in [[Moncton]] (Studio Acadie)&lt;ref name="Acadie"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onf.ca/selection/lonf-en-acadie-35-ans-de-creation/|title=L'ONF en Acadie, 35 ans de création|work=ONF.ca|publisher=National Film Board of Canada|language=French|accessdate=October 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Toronto (Canadian Francophone Studio).&lt;ref name="Yeo"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Yeo|first1=Debra|title=NFB's Ontario Studio gets new Toronto digs|url=https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/movies/2016/12/06/nfbs-ontario-studio-gets-new-toronto-digs.html|accessdate=December 16, 2016|work=Toronto Star|date=December 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NFB also offers support programs for independent filmmakers: in English, via the Filmmaker Assistance Program (FAP) and in French through its Aide du cinéma indépendant – Canada (ACIC) program.

The organization has a hierarchical structure headed by a ''Board of Trustees'', which is chaired by the ''Government Film Commissioner and NFB Chairperson''. It is overseen by the ''Board of Trustees Secretariat and Legal Affairs''.

Funding is derived primarily from government of Canada transfer payments, and also from its own revenue streams. These revenues are from print sales, film production services, rentals, and royalties, and total up to $10 million yearly; the NFB lists this as ''Respendable Revenues'' in its financial statements. As a result of cuts imposed by [[2012 Canadian federal budget]], by 2015 the NFB's public funding will be reduced by $6.7 million, to $60.3 million.&lt;ref name=cbccuts/&gt;

As part of the [[2016 Canadian federal budget]], the NFB will receive an additional $13.5 million in funding, spread out over a five-year period.&lt;ref name="2016 budget"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/arts-community-had-better-spend-its-budget-money-wisely/article29358551/|title=FEDERAL BUDGET 2016: Arts community had better spend its budget money wisely|last=Taylor|first=Kate|date=March 23, 2016|work=The Globe and Mail|accessdate=March 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Albert William Trueman 1947.jpg|thumb|Albert William Trueman was NFB commissioner from 1953–1957]]
In 1938, the Government of Canada invited [[John Grierson]], a British documentary film producer who introduced the term "documentary" to English-speaking film criticism, to study the state of the government's film production. Up to that date, the Government Motion Picture Bureau, established in 1918, had been the major Canadian film producer. The results of Grierson's report were included in the National Film Act of 1939.&lt;ref name="RFL" /&gt;

In {{start date and age|1939|paren=y}}, the Act led to the establishment of the National Film Commission, which was subsequently renamed the National Film Board (NFB). The NFB was founded in part to create propaganda in support of the Second World War.&lt;ref name="RFL"&gt;[[Ann Curthoys]], [[Marilyn Lake]] [https://books.google.com/books?id=JE6YM8jcRucC&amp;pg=PA151 Connected worlds: history in transnational perspective, Volume 2004] p.151. Australian National University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1940, with Canada at war, the NFB launched its ''[[Canada Carries On]]'' series of morale boosting theatrical shorts.&lt;ref name="CFE"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreferencelibrary.ca/index.asp?layid=44&amp;csid1=615&amp;navid=66 |title=Canada Carries On |last=Morris |first=Peter |work=Canadian Film Encyclopedia |publisher=Film Reference Library |accessdate=October 17, 2009 }}{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The success of ''Canada Carries On'' led to the creation of ''[[The World in Action]]'', which was more geared to international audiences.&lt;ref name="Ohayon2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.nfb.ca/2009/09/30/propaganda-cinema-the-world-in-action/|title=Propaganda Cinema at the NFB – The World in Action|last=Ohayon|first=Albert|date=September 30, 2009 |work=NFB.ca|publisher=National Film Board of Canada|accessdate=2009-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this period, other NFB films were issued as [[newsreel]]s, such as ''[[The War Is Over (1945 film)|The War Is Over]]'' (1945), intended for theatrical showings. These films were based on current news and often tackled wartime events as well as contemporary issues in Canadian culture.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

Early in its history, the NFB was a primarily English-speaking institution. Based in Ottawa, 90% of its staff were English and the few [[French Canadian]]s in production worked with English crews. There was a French Unit which was responsible for versioning films into French but it was headed by an Anglophone. And in NFB annual reports of the time, French films were listed under "foreign languages". Screenwriter [[Jacques Bobet]], hired in 1947, worked to strengthen the French Unit and retain French talent, and was appointed producer of French versions in 1951.&lt;ref name="Bobet NFB"/&gt; During that period, commissioner [[Albert Trueman]], sensitive to how the [[Quiet Revolution]] was beginning to transform Quebec society, brought in [[Pierre Juneau]] as the NFB's "French Advisor". Juneau recommended the creation of a French production branch to enable francophone filmmakers to work and create in their own language.&lt;ref name="Interest"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gM2j0CN64isC&amp;pg=PA355&amp;dq=Jacques+Bobet&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=AdKhT8jMNdGcgQeNyZjfCA&amp;ved=0CFAQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=Jacques%20Bobet&amp;f=false | title=In the National Interest: A Chronicle of the National Film Board of Canada from 1949–1989 | publisher=University of Toronto Press | year=1991 | accessdate=2012-05-02 | author=Evans, Gary | pages=34–35 | isbn=0-8020-2784-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1940s and early 1950s, the NFB employed 'travelling projectionists' who toured the country, bringing films and public discussions to rural communities.&lt;ref name="Kinema"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Graham|first=Gerald|date=November 19, 2002|title=Five Filmmakers in Conversation with Gerald Pratley |journal=Kinema|publisher=University of Waterloo|url=http://www.arts.uwaterloo.ca/~kinema/nfb1011.htm|accessdate=2009-02-17}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nfb.ca/film/movie_showman/|title=Movie Showman|last=Spak|first=Harvey|work=NFB.ca|publisher=National Film Board of Canada|accessdate=2009-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mandate revisions===
In 1950, a revision of the National Film Act removed any direct government intervention into the operation and administration of the NFB.&lt;ref name=filmact&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/en/article/national-film-board-of-canada/|title=National Film Board of Canada/Office national du film du Canada|work=The Canadian Encyclopedia|publisher=Historica Foundation of Canada|accessdate=2006-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1956, the NFB's headquarters was relocated from Ottawa to Montreal, improving the NFB's reputation in French Canada and making the NFB more attractive to French-speaking filmmakers.&lt;ref name="Bobet NFB" /&gt;

In 1964, a separate French production branch was finally established, with Bobet as one of its four initial executive producers.&lt;ref name="Bobet NFB"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://onf-nfb.gc.ca/eng/portraits/260/ | title=Bobet Jacques | publisher=National Film Board of Canada | work=NFB PROFILES | accessdate=2012-04-29 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121018070118/http://www.onf-nfb.gc.ca/eng/portraits/260/ | archivedate=2012-10-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1967, the creation of the Canadian Film Development Corporation (now known as [[Telefilm Canada]]) refined the mandate for the National Film Board. The Canadian Film Development Corporation would become responsible for promoting the development of the film industry.&lt;ref name=telefilm&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pch.gc.ca/progs/ac-ca/pol/cinema-film/pubs/epart3.htm|title=Canadian Film Policy: History of Federal Initiatives|publisher=[[Heritage Canada]]|date=January 22, 2003|accessdate=2006-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Challenge for Change]] was also created the same year as a community media project which would develop the use of film and video as a tool for initiating social change.&lt;ref name="OISE"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oise.utoronto.ca/research/edu20/moments/1966cfc.html|title=Challenge for Change launched, a participatory media approach to citizenship education|last=Schugurensky|first=Daniel |year=2005|work=History of Education|publisher=The Ontario Institute for Studies in Education of the University of Toronto (OISE/UT)|accessdate=2009-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, the National Film Board produced several educational films in partnership with [[Parks Canada]], including Bill Schmalz's ''[[Bears and Man]]''.&lt;ref name=Colpitts&gt;{{cite book|last=Colpitts|first=George|title=A Century of Parks Canada, 1911-2011|year=2011|publisher=University of Calgary Press|location=Calgary|isbn=9781552385265 | pages = 153–169|editor=Claire Elizabeth Campbell|chapter=Films, Tourists, and Bears in the National Parks: Managing Park Use and the Problematic ‘Highway Bum’ Bear|url=http://dspace.ucalgary.ca/bitstream/1880/48466/17/UofCPress_ParksCanada_2011_Chapter12.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1970s, the NFB began a process of [[decentralization]], opening film production centres in cities across Canada. The move had been championed by NFB producers such as [[Rex Tasker]], who became the first executive producer of the NFB's studio in Halifax.&lt;ref name="tasker"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://thechronicleherald.ca/artslife/1211340-atlantic-move-part-of-nfb-s-history | title=Atlantic move part of NFB’s history | work=[[The Chronicle Herald]] | date=May 30, 2014 | accessdate=2014-06-02 | author=Cooke, Stephen | location=Halifax}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Canada Vignettes''===
{{Main|Canada Vignettes}}
During the 1970s and early 1980s, the National Film Board produced a series of [[wikt:vignette|vignette]]s, some of which aired on [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]] and other Canadian broadcasters as [[interstitial program]]s. The vignettes became popular because of their cultural depiction of Canada, and because they represented its changing state, such as the vignette ''Faces'' which was made to represent the increasing cultural and ethnic diversity of Canada. In 1996, the NFB [[operating budget]] was cut by 32%, forcing it to lay off staff and to close its [[film laboratory]], [[sound stage]] (now [[privatization|privatized]]) and other departments.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

===21st century===
In 2006, the NFB marked the 65th anniversary of NFB animation with an international retrospective of restored Norman McLaren classics and the launch of the DVD box set, ''Norman McLaren – The Master's Edition''. The NFB budget has since been cut again. The six-storey John Grierson Building at its Montreal headquarters has been unused for several years – with HQ staff now based solely in its adjacent Norman McLaren Building. In October 2009, the NFB released a free app for Apple's [[iPhone]] that would allow users to watch thousands of NFB films directly on their cell phones.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://blog.nfb.ca/blog/2009/10/20/nfb-iphone-app/|title=What’s inside the new NFB iPhone App - NFB/blog|date=2009-10-20|work=NFB/blog|access-date=2018-01-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the NFB released an iPad version of their app that streams NFB films, many in high definition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://blog.nfb.ca/blog/2010/06/30/the-nfb-films-ipad-app-is-now-available/|title=The NFB Films iPad app is now available! - NFB/blog|date=2010-06-30|work=NFB/blog|access-date=2018-01-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2012, the NFB's funding was cut 10%, to be phased in over a three-year period, as part of the [[2012 Canadian federal budget]].&lt;ref name=Kelly&gt;{{cite news|last=Kelly|first=Brendan|title=CBC, NFB and Telefilm to see 10% cut|url=https://montrealgazette.com/entertainment/Telefilm/6382993/story.html#ixzz1qzGXr2EA|accessdate=2012-04-03|newspaper=[[Montreal Gazette]]|date=March 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NFB eliminated 73 full and part-time positions.&lt;ref name=cbccuts/&gt;

Beginning on 2 May 2014, the NFB's 75th anniversary was marked by such events as the release of a series of commemorative stamps by [[Canada Post]],&lt;ref name="stamp"&gt;{{cite press release | url=http://www.newswire.ca/en/story/1348609/new-stamp-issue-celebrates-the-75th-anniversary-of-the-national-film-board | title=New stamp issue celebrates the 75th anniversary of the National Film Board | publisher=[[Canada Post]] | date=May 2, 2014 | accessdate=2014-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an NFB documentary about the film board's early years, entitled ''Shameless Propaganda''.&lt;ref name="shameless"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.bramptonguardian.com/whatson-story/4515216-documentary-reveals-nfb-wartime-propaganda/ | title=Documentary reveals NFB wartime propaganda | work=Brampton Guardian | date=May 12, 2014 | agency=The Canadian Press | accessdate=2014-05-17 | author=Kane, Laura}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Documentary==

===Cinéma vérité and Direct Cinema===
In the post-war era the NFB became a pioneer in new developments in [[documentary film]]. The NFB played a key role in both the [[Cinéma vérité]] and [[Direct Cinema]] movements, working on technical innovations to make its 16&amp;nbsp;mm [[synchronized sound]] equipment more light-weight and portable—most notably the "Sprocketape" portable sound recorder invented for the film board by Ches Beachell in 1955. Influenced by the work of [[Henri Cartier-Bresson]], the NFB's Studio B production unit experimented with cinema verite in its 1958 ''[[Candid Eye]]'' series. ''Candid Eye'' along with such NFB French-language films as ''[[Les Raquetteurs]]'' (1958) have been credited as helping to inspire the cinéma vérité documentary movement. Other key cinéma vérité films during this period included ''[[Lonely Boy (film)|Lonely Boy]]'' (1961) and ''[[Ladies and Gentlemen... Mr. Leonard Cohen]]'' (1965).&lt;ref name="Aitken"&gt;{{cite book|last=Aitken|first=Ian|title=Encyclopedia of the Documentary Film|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JdSNAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA168&amp;lpg=PA168&amp;dq=NFB+cinema+verite&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=nOyhDgOKjX&amp;sig=ntrnk-njA9xlm0EHn5Q2lwD8q7U&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=bEl3Vc3KF4K_sQTh9JnwDQ&amp;ved=0CFEQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=NFB%20cinema%20verite&amp;f=false|date=October 27, 2005|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1579584450|page=168}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Challenge for Change''/''Societé Nouvelle''===
{{main|Challenge for Change}}
Running from 1967 to 1980, ''Challenge for Change'' and its French-language equivalent ''Societé Nouvelle'' became a global model for the use of film and portable video technology to create community-based participatory documentary films to promote dialogue on local issues and promote social change. Over two hundred such films were produced, including 27 films about Fogo Island, Newfoundland, directed by [[Colin Low (filmmaker)|Colin Low]] and early NFB efforts in Indigenous filmmaking, such as [[Willie Dunn]]'s ''The Battle of Crowfoot'' (1968).&lt;ref name="Aitken"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Waugh&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=w2KVxcA2pcwC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22Challenge+for+Change%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwAGoVChMIs7nEve-FxgIVskOMCh2iQQAC#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Challenge%20for%20Change%22&amp;f=false Challenge for Change: Activist Documentary at the National Film Board of Canada]'' (2010). Thomas Waugh, Michael Brendan Baker, Ezra Winton (eds). Montreal-Kingston: McGill-Queens University Press., pp. 5-6&lt;/ref&gt;

===Giant-screen cinema===
NFB documentarians played a key role in the development of the [[IMAX]] film format, following the NFB multi-screen experience ''[[In the Labyrinth (film)|In the Labyrinth]]'', created for [[Expo 67]] in Montreal. The film was the centrepiece of a $4.5 million pavilion, which attracted over 1.3 million visitors in 1967, and was co-directed by [[Roman Kroitor]], [[Colin Low (filmmaker)|Colin Low]] and [[Hugh O'Connor (filmmaker)|Hugh O'Connor]], and produced by [[Tom Daly (filmmaker)|Tom Daly]] and Kroitor. After Expo, Kroitor left the NFB to co-found what would become known as [[IMAX Corporation]], with [[Graeme Ferguson]] and Robert Kerr. The NFB continued to be involved with IMAX breakthroughs at subsequent world's fairs, with NFB director [[Donald Brittain]] directing the first-ever IMAX film ''[[Tiger Child]]'' for [[Expo 70]] in Osaka, and with the NFB producing the first full-colour IMAX-3D film ''[[Transitions (film)|Transitions]]'' for [[Expo 86]] in Vancouver and the first 48 fps IMAX HD film ''[[Momentum (IMAX film)|Momentum]]'' for [[Seville Expo '92]].&lt;ref&gt;Aitken 2005, pp. 168-169&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alternative drama===
In the 1980s, the National Film Board also produced a number of "alternative drama" films, which combined documentary and narrative fiction filmmaking techniques.&lt;ref name=docufiction&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CJr5BJkGQoQC&amp;pg=PA239&amp;dq=Giles+Walker+NFB&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ZaItU8nMMYnTqgHXi4HwBA&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Giles%20Walker%20NFB&amp;f=false | title=Canada's Best Features: Critical Essays on 15 Canadian Films | publisher=Rodopi | author=Stukator, Angela | date=May 30, 2013 | pages=239 | isbn=978-9042015982 | editor=Eugene P. Walz | chapter=Pictures of age and ageing in Cynthia Scott's The Company of Strangers}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally starring non-professional actors, these films used a documentary format to present a fictionalized story and were generally scripted by the filmmakers and the cast through a process of [[improvisation]], and are thus classified as [[docufiction]].&lt;ref name=docufiction/&gt;

The alternative drama films were ''[[The Masculine Mystique]]'' (1984), ''[[90 Days (film)|90 Days]]'' (1985), ''[[Sitting in Limbo (film)|Sitting in Limbo]]'' (1986), ''[[The Last Straw (1987 film)|The Last Straw]]'' (1987), ''[[Train of Dreams]]'' (1987), ''[[Welcome to Canada]]'' (1989) and ''[[The Company of Strangers]]'' (1990).&lt;ref name=docufiction/&gt;

==Animation==
[[File:Norman McLaren drawing on film - 1944.jpg|thumb|upright|McLaren drawing on film, 1944]]
{{Further|:Category:National Film Board of Canada animated short films|NFB Shorts}}
When [[Norman McLaren]] joined the organization in 1941, the NFB began production of animation. The animation department eventually gained distinction, particularly with the pioneering work of McLaren, an internationally recognized [[experimental filmmaker]]. The NFB's French-language animation unit was founded in 1966 by [[René Jodoin]].&lt;ref name="Milligan"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.animationmagazine.net/people/nfb-french-animation-founder-rene-jodoin-dies/|title=NFB French Animation Founder René Jodoin Dies|last=Milligan|first=Mercedes|date=January 28, 2015|work=[[Animation Magazine]]|accessdate=January 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Drawn-on-film animation===
When McLaren joined the NFB, his first film at the film board was the [[Drawn-on-film animation|drawn-on-film]] short, ''Mail Early''. He would go on to refine his technique make a series of hand-drawn films at the NFB during and after the Second World War, most notably ''[[Boogie-Doodle]]'' (1940), ''[[Hen Hop]]'' (1942), ''[[Begone Dull Care]]'' (1949) and ''[[Blinkity Blank]]'' (1955).&lt;ref name="McWilliams"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mclaren2014.com/about_norman_mclaren|title=About Norman McLaren|last=McWilliams|first=Donald|work=McLaren 2014|accessdate=August 23, 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151013005644/http://www.mclaren2014.com/about_norman_mclaren|archivedate=October 13, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pinscreen animation===
The NFB was a pioneer in several novel techniques such as [[pinscreen animation]], and as of June 2012, the NFB is reported to have the only working animation pinscreen in the world.&lt;ref name="VarietyJune4"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://variety.com/2012/digital/news/nfb-pushes-canadian-artists-in-edgy-direction-1118054435/ | title=NFB pushes Canadian artists in edgy direction | work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date=June 4, 2012 | accessdate=November 10, 2018 | author=Blair, Iain}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stop-motion animation===
McLaren's Oscar-winning ''[[Neighbours (1952 film)|Neighbours]]'' popularized the form of character movement referred to as [[pixilation]], a variant of [[stop motion]]. The term pixilation itself was created by NFB animator [[Grant Munro (filmmaker)|Grant Munro]] in an experimental film of the same name. In 2015, the NFB's animation studios were credited as helping to lead a revival in stop-motion animation in Canada, building on the tradition of NFB animators such as McLaren and [[Co Hoedeman]].&lt;ref name="Doherty"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/beta/arts/shaun-the-sheep-leads-the-stop-motion-animation-revival-1.3184267|title=Shaun the Sheep leads the stop-motion animation revival|last=Doherty|first=Mike|work=CBC Arts|publisher=August 8, 2015|accessdate=August 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Computer animation===
The NFB was a pioneer in [[computer animation]], releasing one of the first CGI films, ''[[Hunger (1974 film)|Hunger]]'', in 1974, then forming its Centre d'animatique in 1980 to develop new CGI technologies.&lt;ref name="canstudies"&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xy09GvHqNRgC&amp;pg=PA232&amp;dq=Centre+d%E2%80%99animatique+ONF&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=prTQT4DoIOaJ6gHn5rx8&amp;ved=0CEAQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | title=L'Office national du film et le cinéma canadien (1939-2003) | author=Zéau, Caroline | journal=Études Canadiennes | year=2006 | volume=10 | page=232 | isbn=9052013381 | publisher=[[Peter Lang (publishing company)|Peter Lang]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Staff at the Centre d'animatique included [[Daniel Langlois]], who left in 1986 to form [[Softimage (company)|Softimage]].&lt;ref name="Century"&gt;{{cite conference | url=http://www.banffcentre.ca/bnmi/programs/archives/2005/refresh/docs/conferences/michael_century.pdf | title=New Media in an Adhocracy | publisher=[[Banff Centre]] | accessdate=June 8, 2012 | author=Century, Michael | date=September 29 – October 4, 2005 | conference=REFRESH conference, First International Conference on the Media Arts, Sciences and Technologies | location=[[Banff, Alberta]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NFB was licensed by [[IMAX Corporation]] to develop new artistic applications using its [[SANDDE]] system for hand-drawn stereoscopic computer animation, with the NFB producing a number of films including ''[[Falling in Love Again (2003 film)|Falling in Love Again]]'' (2003) and ''[[Subconscious Password]]'' (2013).&lt;ref name="Giardina"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/behind-screen/siggraph-oscar-winner-chris-landreth-590998|title=Siggraph: Oscar Winner Chris Landreth Shows His New Short 'Subconscious Password'|last=Giardina|first=Carolyn|date=July 23, 2013|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|accessdate=August 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Traditional animation===
Traditional animators included [[Richard Condie]], John Weldon, Allison Snowden, [[Janet Perlman]], Cordell Barker, Brad Caslor, Michael Mills, Paul Driessen among others (some draw on paper rather than cels).

===Sand animation===
Caroline Leaf used this technique on films such as The Metamorphosis Of Mr. Samsa and The Owl Who Married A Goose. The Sand Castle was the first (and so far only) sand animation to win an Oscar.

===Paint on glass animation===
Wendy Tilby and Amanda Forbes perfected the paint on glass technique (mixing oil paint with glycerine) on films such as Strings and Wild Life. This technique was also used on Caroline Leaf's film The Street.

==Interactive==
===Works===
As of March 2013, the NFB devotes one quarter of its production budget to [[interactive media]], including [[web documentaries]].&lt;ref name="Deglise"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ledevoir.com/culture/actualites-culturelles/375392/l-insomnie-par-procuration|title=L’insomnie par procuration|last=Deglise|first=Fabien|date=April 11, 2013|work=[[Le Devoir]]|language=French|accessdate=April 15, 2013|location=Montreal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kristy Hutter"&gt;{{cite news|last=Hutter|first=Kristy|title=A documentary like no other documentary|url=http://www2.macleans.ca/2012/01/18/a-documentary-like-no-other-documentary/|accessdate=January 19, 2012|newspaper=[[Maclean's]]|date=January 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NFB is a pioneer in interactive web documentaries, helping to position Canada as a major player in digital storytelling, according to [[transmedia]] creator [[Anita Ondine Smith]],&lt;ref name=Vlessing&gt;{{cite news|last=Vlessing|first=Etan|title=Expert: Canada Primed to Become Major Transmedia Player|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/expert-canada-primed-become-major-282926|accessdate=January 19, 2012|newspaper=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=January 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as Shari Frilot, programmer for [[Sundance Film Festival]]'s New Frontier program for digital media.&lt;ref name="Monk2015"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.canada.com/entertainment/Canada+king+Frontier+Sundance+Film+Festival/10774426/story.html|title=Canada is king of the New Frontier at Sundance Film Festival|last=Monk|first=Katherine|date=January 30, 2015|work=[[Canada.com]]|publisher=[[Postmedia News]]|accessdate=January 31, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150203022102/http://www.canada.com/entertainment/Canada+king+Frontier+Sundance+Film+Festival/10774426/story.html|archive-date=February 3, 2015|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====First Stories and Second Stories====
In 2005, the NFB introduced its "First Stories" program for emerging Indigenous directors from Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba. Twelve five-minute films were produced through the program, with four from each province. First Stories was followed by "Second Stories," in which three filmmakers from the previous program—[[Gerald Auger]], Tessa Desnomie and Lorne Olson—were invited back to create 20 minute films.&lt;ref name="Knopf"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Knopf|first1=Kerstin|title=Decolonizing the Lens of Power: Indigenous Films in North America|date=2008|publisher=Rodopi|isbn=9042025433|page=64|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dNwFL-5b_9YC&amp;pg=PA64&amp;dq=NFB+%22First+Stories%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiK7OOA1NbTAhVM6YMKHaxgAiUQ6AEIIzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=NFB%20%22First%20Stories%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=4 May 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sidsworth|first1=Adam|title=Cinema Revisited: NFB and the Indigenous voice {{!}} Toronto Film Scene|url=http://thetfs.ca/article/cinema-revisited-nfb-indigenous-voice/|accessdate=16 May 2017|work=Toronto Film Scene|date=1 November 2015}}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://onf-nfb.gc.ca/en/our-collection/?idfilm=57577|title=Second Stories - DVD|last=|first=|date=|website=National Film Board of Canada|language=en|access-date=2017-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NFB was a founding partner in [[Wapikoni Mobile]], a mobile film and media production unit for emerging First Nations filmmakers in Quebec.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/wapikoni-mobile-10-years-of-mediation-and-intervention-through-audiovisual-creation-514301541.html|title=Wapikoni Mobile: 10 years of mediation and intervention through audiovisual creation|last=|first=|date=|website=Canada News Wire|language=en|access-date=2017-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Early programs====
The Indian Film Crew was an early effort in [[First Nations]] filmmaking at the NFB, through its Challenge for Change program, and was jointly sponsored by the [[Company of Young Canadians]] and the [[Department of Indian Affairs]]. After five months' training about various aspects of filmmaking, participants worked on community development projects and research for future films. The unit's first release was ''[[The Ballad of Crowfoot]]'' (1968), described as "the first NFB film to present First Nations experience from an Indigenous point of view."&lt;ref name="fixing"&gt;{{cite web|last=Lewis|first=Philip|title=Fixing the Gaze: New Indigenous Work at the NFB|url=http://blog.nfb.ca/blog/2017/01/05/fixing-the-gaze-2/|website=NFB/blog|publisher=National Film Board of Canada|accessdate=4 May 2017|date=5 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent films included the 1969 documentaries ''These Are My People'' and ''[[You Are on Indian Land]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Honarpisheh|first=Farbod |title=The Cinema of Canada|editor=Jerry White|publisher=Wallflower Press|location=London|pages=81–89|chapter=You Are On Indian Land|isbn=1-904764-60-6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yc0bQ1-a8ZIC&amp;pg=PA81&amp;lpg=PA81&amp;dq=%22You+Are+on+Indian+Land%22+Mort&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=HQn0z1SxH9&amp;sig=uV1FfM4-NuvRaRoxrjEMhe8Stx0&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=pcYVS7DVFsO1lAfj7LzHBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22You%20Are%20on%20Indian%20Land%22%20Mort&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Tracey&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tracey|first1=Andrew|title=Now Reconciled: Nearly 50 years later, the director of a landmark First Nations film gets his rightful recognition|url=http://press.tiff.net/the-review/now-reconciled/|work=The Review|publisher=[[Toronto International Film Festival]]|accessdate=4 May 2017|language=en|date=24 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A documentary was also made about the effort to increase aboriginal representation in filmmaking.&lt;ref name="Cardinal"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nfb.ca/playlists/gil-cardinal/aboriginal-voice-national-film-board-/|title=The Aboriginal Voice: the National Film Board and Aboriginal Filmmaking through the Years|last=Cardinal|first=Gil|publisher=National Film Board of Canada|accessdate=2 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Women's production==
The NFB has been a leader in films by women, with the world's first publicly funded women's film's studio, Studio D, followed subsequently by its French-language equivalent, Studio des femmes. Beginning on March 8, 2016, [[International Women's Day]], the NFB began introducing a series of gender parity initiatives.

===Studio D===
In 1974, in conjunction with [[International Women's Year]], the NFB created Studio D on the recommendation of long-time employee [[Kathleen Shannon]]. Shannon was designated as Executive Director of the new studio—the first government-funded film studio dedicated to women filmmakers in the world— which became one of the NFB's most celebrated filmmaking units, winning awards and breaking distribution records.&lt;ref name="Aitken"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collectionscanada.ca/women/002026-714-e.html|title=Canadian Women in Film|date=April 12, 2005|work=Library and Archives Canada|accessdate=February 2, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070518224627/http://www.collectionscanada.ca/women/002026-714-e.html|archivedate=May 18, 2007|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Screen legend"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.montrealmirror.com/ARCHIVES/1997/082197/film4.html|title=Screen legend|last=Hays|first=Matthew|date=August 21, 1997|work=Montreal Mirror|accessdate=August 10, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021231170032/http://www.montrealmirror.com/ARCHIVES/1997/082197/film4.html|archive-date=December 31, 2002|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable films produced by the studio include three Academy Award-winning documentaries ''[[I'll Find a Way]]'' (1977), ''[[If You Love This Planet]]'' (1982) and ''[[Flamenco at 5:15]]'' (1983), as well as ''[[Not a Love Story]]'' (1982) and ''[[Forbidden Love: The Unashamed Stories of Lesbian Lives]]'' (1992). Studio D was shut down in 1996, amidst a sweeping set of federal government budget cuts, which impacted the NFB as a whole.&lt;ref name="Aitken"/&gt;

As of March 8, 2016, researchers and librarians at the [[University of Calgary]] announced an archival project to preserve records of Studio D.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ucalgary.ca/utoday/issue/2017-03-08/researchers-build-archival-record-feminist-filmmaking-canada|title=Researchers build archival record of feminist filmmaking in Canada|last=Sowa|first=Jennifer|date=|website=UToday|publisher=University of Calgary|language=en|access-date=March 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Former studios and departments===

====Still Photography Division====
Upon its merger with the [[Canadian Government Motion Picture Bureau]] in 1941, the NFB's mandate expanded to include motion as well as still pictures, resulting in the creation of the Still Photography Division of the NFB.

[[File:Cinema ONF.JPG|thumb|Montreal CineRobotheque, July 2008.]]
From 1941 to 1984, the Division commissioned freelance photographers to document every aspect of life in Canada. These images were widely distributed through publication in various media.

In 1985, this Division officially became the [[Canadian Museum of Contemporary Photography]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.collectionscanada.ca/inuit/054304-e.html "Photo Collections" in ''Project Naming''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070128131729/http://www.collectionscanada.ca/inuit/054304-e.html |date=January 28, 2007 }}, the identification of Inuit portrayed in photographic collections at Library and Archives Canada&lt;/ref&gt;

The division's work is the subject of a 2013 book by [[Carleton University]] art professor Carol Payne entitled ''The Official Picture: The National Film Board of Canada’s Still Photography Division and the Image of Canada, 1941-1971'', published by the [[McGill-Queen's University Press]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irpp.org/en/po/summer-reading-for-wonks/mid-century-lens/|title=Mid-century lens: The National Film Board of Canada’s still photos, 1941-71|date=July 2013|work=Policy Options|publisher=[[Institute for Research on Public Policy]]|accessdate=January 2, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140102201403/http://www.irpp.org/en/po/summer-reading-for-wonks/mid-century-lens/|archivedate=January 2, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
In addition to ''[[Neighbours (1952 film)|Neighbours]]'', other NFB productions have been the source of controversy, including two NFB productions broadcast on CBC Television that criticized the role of Canadians in wartime led to questions in the [[Senate of Canada]].

In the early 1970s, two Quebec political documentaries, [[Denys Arcand]]'s ''[[On est au coton]]'' and [[Gilles Groulx]]'s ''[[24 heures ou plus]]'', were initially withheld from release by the NFB due to controversial content.&lt;ref name=Hebert&gt;{{cite book|editor-first1=Pierre|editor-last1=Hébert|editor-first2=Kenneth|editor-last2=Landry|editor-first3=Yves|editor-last3=Lever|title=Dictionnaire de la censure au Québec : littérature et cinéma|date=2006|publisher=Éd.

''[[The Kid Who Couldn't Miss]]'' (1982) cast doubt on the accomplishments of Canadian World War I flying ace [[Billy Bishop]], sparking widespread outrage, including complaints in the Senate subcommittee on Veterans' Affairs.&lt;ref name=cowan&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0JSF/is_37_11/ai_87019610 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040924083230/http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0JSF/is_37_11/ai_87019610 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=September 24, 2004 |title=Paul Cowan's inquisitive eye: war games porn stars and the Ghosts of Westray |last=Alioff |first=Maurie |publisher=TAKE ONE |year=2002 |accessdate=August 30, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A decade later, ''[[The Valour and the Horror]]'' outraged some when it suggested that there was incompetence on the part of Canadian military command, and that Canadian soldiers had committed unprosecuted [[war crime]]s against German soldiers. The series became the subject of an inquiry by the Senate.

Other controversial productions included the 1981 film ''[[Not a Love Story: A Film About Pornography]]'', a 1981 Studio D documentary critiquing pornography that was itself banned in the province of [[Ontario]] on the basis of pornographic content.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/en/article/bonnie-sherr-klein/ "Bonnie Sherr Klein"]. ''The Canadian Encyclopedia''&lt;/ref&gt; Released the following year,  ''[[If You Love This Planet]]'', winner of the [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for best documentary short subject, was labelled foreign propaganda under the [[Foreign Agents Registration Act|Foreign Agents Registration Act of 1938]] in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;The politicized Oscar. (political aspects of Academy Awards, 1983).Richard Grenier. Commentary 75.(June 1983): pp68(7).&lt;/ref&gt;

==NFB on TV==
The NFB is a minority owner of the digital television channel, [[Documentary (TV channel)|Documentary]] in Canada. NFB-branded series ''[[Retrovision]]'' appeared on VisionTV, along with the French-language ''Carnets ONF'' series on [[Aboriginal Peoples Television Network|APTN]]. Moreover, in 1997 the American cable channel [[Cartoon Network]] created a weekly 30-minute show called ''O Canada'' specifically showcasing a compilation of NFB-produced works; the segment was discontinued in favour of ''[[Adult Swim]]''.&lt;ref name=compilation&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0JSF/is_16_6/ai_30214833 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041127115831/http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0JSF/is_16_6/ai_30214833 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=November 27, 2004 |title=O Canada: Canadian animators |last=Simensky |first=Linda |authorlink=Linda Simensky |publisher=TAKE ONE |year=1997 |accessdate=August 30, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ocanada&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.toonarific.com/show.php?show_id=2666|title=O Canada|publisher=Toonarific Cartoons|accessdate=August 30, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As of 2010, many of the NFB children's shows are available on the children's IPTV service [http://www.amebatv.com Ameba].

==Logo==
[[File:Old National Film Board of Canada logo.png|thumb|98px|2002 version.]]
The Board's logo consists of a standing stylized figure (originally green) with its arms wide upward. The arms are met by an arch that mirrors them. The round head in between then resembles a pupil, making the entire symbol appear to be an [[Human eye|eye]] with legs. Launched in 1969, the logo symbolized a vision of humanity and was called "Man Seeing / L'homme qui voit". It was designed by Georges Beaupré. It was updated in 2002 by the firm of Paprika Communications.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.canadiandesignresource.ca/officialgallery/?p=722 Canadian Design Resource&lt;/ref&gt;

}}The '''Nederlandse Centrale Catalogus''' ('''NCC''') is the official Dutch bibliographic catalog and metadata index system that links to and consolidates the catalogs of over 400 libraries in the [[Netherlands]].

== Scope ==
The NCC contains bibliographic data and locations of more than 14 million books and 500,000 [[magazines]] operating in more than 400 [[Netherlands]] [[Library|libraries]] are found. The database is updated by the libraries that participate in the Gemeenschappelijk Geautomatiseerd Catalogussysteem (GGC; ''Shared Automated Cataloguing System).''

The database is managed jointly by the [[National Library of the Netherlands]] (Koninklijke Bibliotheek – KB) and [[OCLC Online Computer Library Center, Inc.]] (OCLC), a non-profit global cooperative headquartered in [[Dublin, Ohio]]. The catalog data has been digitized and is openly accessible online, in multiple languages, ''via'' the Dutch website, [[PiCarta]] [[:nl:PiCarta|(nl)]].

A GGC identifier is synonymous with PPN (PICA Production Number), which derives its name from [[OCLC PICA|PICA]], makers of [[PiCarta]] [[:nl:PiCarta|(nl)]], the main producer of library systems in the Netherlands that was acquired in 2007 by OCLC.  NCC, using OCLC technology, offers interlibrary loan among participating institutions, which includes Article Exchange — a [[cloud-based]] secure [[Image sharing|article sharing]] [[Computing platform|platform]] that automatically deletes articles after a specified number of downloads and number of days.&lt;ref name="OCLC-ArticleExchange" /&gt;

== History ==

The NCC was founded in 1919 through the initiative of [[Philipp Christiaan Molhuysen]] [[:nl:Philipp Christiaan Molhuysen|(nl)]], PhD (1870–1944), librarian and biographer of the [[Dutch Royal Library]] and notable pioneer of [[library science]], who, among other things, spearheaded the first effort on record to centralize a catalog for all books in Dutch libraries.&lt;ref name="Molhuysen 1930" /&gt;  The initial effort culminated in massive collection [[Library catalog|catalog]] cards stored at the [[National Library of the Netherlands]] in [[The Hague]]. As a precursor for the launch, Molhuysen and Elsa Rachel Oppenheim (1885–1941) — his second of three wives — together, completed in 1916 the ''Catalogue de la Bibliothèque du Palais de la Paix,'' for the [[Peace Palace]] law library in [[The Hague]].

In the 1970s and 1980s, the indexing was migrated to digital formats, initially to the GGC, then to the NCC.

The '''Portland Art Museum''' in [[Portland, Oregon]], United States, was founded in 1892, making it the oldest [[art museum]] on the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] and seventh oldest in the US.&lt;ref name="PAM Brief History"&gt;{{cite web | title = About the Museum | publisher = Portland Art Museum | url = http://portlandartmuseum.org/about//history/ | accessdate = 2011-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon completion of the most recent renovations, the Portland Art Museum became one of the 25 largest art museums in the US, at a total of 240,000 square feet (22,000 m²), with more than 112,000 square feet (10,400 m²) of gallery space. The permanent collection has more than 42,000 works of art, and at least one major traveling exhibition is usually on show. The Portland Art Museum features a center for Native American art, a center for Northwest art, a center for modern and contemporary art, permanent exhibitions of Asian art, and an outdoor public sculpture garden. The [[Northwest Film Center]] is also a component of Portland Art Museum.

The mission of the Portland Art Museum is to serve the public by providing access to art of enduring quality, by educating a diverse audience about art and by collecting and preserving a wide range of art for the enrichment of present and future generations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.pam.org/asp/templates/page.asp?pageID=75 Portland Art Museum Mission] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070628232411/https://web.pam.org/asp/templates/page.asp?pageID=75 |date=2007-06-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The museum is accredited by the [[American Alliance of Museums]], with accreditation through 2024.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aam-us.org/docs/accreditation/list-of-accredited-museums.pdf?sfvrsn=4 List of Accredited Museums.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117023703/http://aam-us.org/docs/accreditation/list-of-accredited-museums.pdf?sfvrsn=4 |date=2013-01-17 }} American Alliance of Museums.

==Founding==
Originally incorporated as the '''Portland Art Association''', the museum's roots date to 1892.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oregonencyclopedia.org/articles/portland_art_association/#.VywKABUrLsk|title=Portland Art Association|website=www.oregonencyclopedia.org|access-date=May 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Late that year seven prominent business and cultural leaders in the city created the association so as to start a high-quality art museum for a city approaching 50,000 residents. [[Henry Corbett]] donated $10,000 to the association that funded the museum's first collection (the Corbett Collection), which consisted of one hundred plaster casts of Greek and Roman sculptures. The individual pieces of the collection were selected by Winslow B. Ayer and his wife during a trip to Europe. They had been advised by curators at the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York and the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston|Museum of Fine Arts]] in Boston prior to the trip on what pieces to select. The collection was originally displayed at the Multnomah County Library located at Southwest Seventh and [[Stark Street|Stark]] streets in Downtown.

==Early history==
By the time of the [[Lewis &amp; Clark Exposition]] held in Portland in 1905, the Portland Art Museum had outgrown its location in the public library and had moved into its own building at SW 5th and Taylor. The first exhibition in the new building featured watercolors and paintings that had come to Portland as part of the 1905 Exposition. Curator Henrietta H. Failing (the niece of founder [[Henry Failing]]) organized the exhibition with New England artist Frank Vincent DuMond.

Three years later, in 1908, the museum acquired its first original piece of art, ''Afternoon Sky, Harney Desert'' by American impressionist painter [[Childe Hassam]], who frequented [[Malheur County, Oregon|Malheur]] and [[Harney County, Oregon|Harney]] counties in [[Eastern Oregon]] with his friend, [[C.E.S. Wood]].

Anna Belle Crocker succeeded Henrietta Failing as curator of the museum in 1909. She would remain at the museum until her retirement in 1936. Crocker became one of the Portland Art Museum's most important early figures. She was also the first head of the Museum Art School, which opened in 1909 and is now the [[Pacific Northwest College of Art]].

In late 1913, the museum hosted one of its most important early exhibitions. The exhibition featured artwork that had been on display earlier that year at the famous 1913 New York [[Armory Show]], which introduced American audiences to [[modern art]]. The exhibition included works by [[Paul Cézanne|Cézanne]], [[Van Gogh]], [[Paul Gauguin|Gauguin]], [[Matisse]], [[Manet]], [[Renoir]], and the controversial ''[[Nude Descending a Staircase]]'' by [[Marcel Duchamp]].

The museum continued to grow during the years following World War I. In the 1920s, the museum hosted two memorable exhibitions organized by Sally Lewis, the daughter of a prominent Portland family. Lewis had befriended many well-known artists on trips to New York and Europe. In 1923, Lewis organized an exhibition at the museum that included 44 paintings by [[Picasso]], Matisse, [[André Derain]] and American modernists, such as [[Maurice Prendergast]], [[Charles Burchfield]], and [[Max Weber (artist)|Max Weber]]. She was also one of 22 patrons who purchased Derain's ''Tree'' for the museum's permanent collection. The success of her first exhibition led to her second, more daring endeavor a year later that juxtaposed paintings, drawings, and sculptures from Europe with African masks. Among the sculptures was Brâncuși's ''A Muse'', which Lewis owned and donated to the museum in 1959.

==Main building==
[[File:Portland Art Museum interior (September 2013) - 1.JPG|thumb|A staircase inside the museum]]
The museum's final location opened to the public on November 18, 1932, at the corner of SW Park Avenue and Jefferson Street. The building, designed by noted Portland architect [[Pietro Belluschi]], is situated along downtown Portland's [[South Park Blocks]] and remains a landmark in the city's Cultural District. It was constructed with a lead gift of $100,000 from Winslow B. Ayer, the same patron who selected the museum's collection of plaster casts 40 years earlier. For this reason, the original portion of today's larger main building is referred to as the Ayer Wing.

Barely six years later, construction began on a new wing to expand the main building. The Hirsch Wing, also designed by [[Pietro Belluschi]], was funded largely through the bequest of Ella Hirsch in honor of her parents, [[Solomon Hirsch|Solomon]] and Josephine Hirsch. The new wing opened on September 15, 1939 and doubled the museum's gallery space.&lt;ref name="PAM Brief History"/&gt;

==Post war==
In 1942, the Portland Art Museum celebrated a subdued 50th Anniversary due to World War II. But the following year in 1943, staff completed the museum's first full inventory, which counted a permanent collection of 3,300 objects and 750 works on long-term loan.

The next decade was distinguished by a series of record-setting exhibitions. In 1956, nearly 55,000 visitors came to the museum during the six-week run of an exhibition featuring paintings from the collection of [[Walter Chrysler]]. The exhibition was organized by the Portland Art Museum and toured nine other cities. More than 80,000 people visited for a [[Vincent van Gogh]] exhibition in 1959, the proceeds from which were used to purchase ''[[Water Lilies]]'' by [[Claude Monet]]. The 1950s also witnessed the creation of the museum's Docent Council in 1955, which created a core group of volunteers who continue to serve the museum to this day.

In the 1960s, the museum underwent another major renovation to build the Hoffman Memorial Wing, named for L. Hawley Hoffman, who served as president of the museum twice. Funded by the museum's first capital campaign, the new wing began construction in November 1968 and was finished in September 1970. Pietro Belluschi served as the architect again, and the project allowed him to realize a complete vision for the museum that he had conceived nearly 40 years earlier. The expansion created classroom and studio space for the Museum Art School, a sculpture mall, a new vault for the collections, and an auditorium.

Over the course of the next several decades, the collections and programs of the Portland Art Museum continued to grow and evolve. In 1978, Vivian and [[Gordon Gilkey]] began their association with the museum, bringing with them an extraordinary collection of thousands of works on paper that would eventually lead to the opening of the Vivian and Gordon Gilkey Center for Graphic Arts in 1993. Also in 1978, the [[Northwest Film Center]] was incorporated into the museum, offering a wide range of film festivals, classes, and outreach programs focused on the moving image arts.

==Modern era==
[[File:Portland Art Museum Mark Building - Oregon.JPG|thumb|PAM's [[Mark Building]]]]
The Portland Art Museum celebrated its centennial in 1992, which was marked by successful negotiations to purchase the Masonic Temple, now known as the [[Mark Building]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Latest Buzz on Our Big Sister City|last=Nicholas|first=Jonathan|date=1992-01-30|work=The Oregonian|pages=D01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The purchase was completed in 1994, the same year that a capital campaign to finance a refurbishment of the Main Building began. This ambitious project included improving the galleries, reinstalling the permanent collection, and equipping the building with a climate control system. The refurbishment allowed the museum to host the most successful exhibition in its history: Imperial Tombs of China, which brought 430,000 visitors to the museum the following year.

A major renovation of the Hoffman Wing was completed in 2000 and added more than {{convert|50000|sqft|m2|-3}} of new gallery space to the museum. The first gallery space addition since 1939, the new galleries included the Grand Ronde Center for Native American Art and the Arlene and Harold Schnitzer Center for Northwest Art. The renovation was funded by the largest capital campaign ever undertaken by a cultural organization in the State of Oregon, which raised $45 million.

In 2001, the Portland Art Museum announced the largest single acquisition in its history when it purchased the private collection of renowned New York art critic [[Clement Greenberg]]. The 159 works by artists such as [[Kenneth Noland]], [[Jules Olitski]], and [[Anthony Caro]] substantially enhanced the museum's permanent collection of 20th century modern and contemporary art. To house this new collection, the museum renovated the former Masonic temple, transforming it into the {{convert|141000|sqft|m2|-2|sing=on}} Mark Building, which opened in October 2005. The renovation added the six-floor, {{convert|28000|sqft|m2|-2|sing=on}} Jubitz Center for Modern and Contemporary Art, the largest exhibition space for modern and contemporary art in the region. The Mark Building also houses the 33,000 volume Crumpacker Family Library, meeting spaces, ballrooms, and administrative offices.

Now with a collection consisting of some 40,000 objects, the Portland Art Museum is one of the leading cultural institutions in the Pacific Northwest. The museum is currently under the leadership of Brian Ferriso, The Marilyn H. and Dr. [[Robert B. Pamplin, Jr.]] Director since 2006. In 2007, [[Vincent van Gogh]]'s 1884 painting ''[[Cart with Black Ox|The Ox-Cart]]'' was donated to the museum, becoming the first work of that artist in a Northwest museum.&lt;ref&gt;Row, D.K.

In 2016, the Portland Art Museum announced that it will undertake a glass-walled expansion to unite its two existing free-standing buildings. The addition, to be called the Rothko Pavilion, comes with a partnership with [[Mark Rothko]]’s children, Christopher Rothko and Kate Rothko Prizel, that will provide loans of major Rothko paintings from their private collection. The works will be lent individually in rotation over the course of the next two decades.&lt;ref&gt;Randy Kennedy (October 8, 2016), [https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/08/arts/design/mark-rothko-portland-museum-of-art-rothko-pavilion-new-wing.html Mark Rothko, Son of Oregon, to Be Honored With Museum Wing] ''[[New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Oregon Biennial==
The '''Oregon Biennial''' was a [[wikt:biennale|biennial]] [[art exhibition]] held every two years at PAM.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.pam.org/asp/special_exhibitions/exhibitions.asp?exhibitionID=37 Portland Art Museum Special Exhibitions: 2006 Biennial] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927095352/http://web.pam.org/asp/special_exhibitions/exhibitions.asp?exhibitionID=37 |date=2007-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, it was replaced by the Contemporary Northwest Art Awards or CNAA, which will be held every two years and covers artists in Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Wyoming and Montana selected from a shortlist of artists. One artist from the CNAA show will be awarded the $10,000 Arlene Schnitzer Prize.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.portlandart.net/archives/2007/04/goodby_oregon_b.html Goodbye Oregon Biennial, Hello CNAA]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Potlatch''' is a [[free software]] editing tool for [[OpenStreetMap]] [[geodata]] using [[Adobe Flash]]. It is one of two editors embedded directly within the OpenStreetMap website.

Potlatch&amp;nbsp;2 requires a [[web browser]] with at least version&amp;nbsp;8 of the Flash plugin installed. It continues to be actively maintained.

== History ==
Potlatch&amp;nbsp;1&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=P1 repository|url=https://trac.openstreetmap.org/browser/subversion/applications/editors/potlatch}}&lt;/ref&gt; was released mid 2006&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Potlatch 1|first=Richard|last=Fairhurst|url=http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/w/index.php?title=Potlatch_1&amp;oldid=7072}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was the default editor on the main OpenStreetMap site until it was replaced by Potlatch&amp;nbsp;2 in April 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Awesone Patlatch 2 team awarded Lolcat of Awesomeness|first=Richard|last=Weait|url=https://blog.openstreetmap.org/2011/04/07/awesome-potlatch-2-team-awarded-lolcat-of-awe/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name ''Potlatch'' came from the name of newsletter of the [[Lettrist International]] art collective.&lt;ref name="starts-editor"/&gt;

An [[alpha version]] of Potlatch&amp;nbsp;2, a complete reimplementation of the software, was published in summer 2010. In December 2010, Potlatch&amp;nbsp;2 was released for general use. After [[Microsoft]] had granted OpenStreetMap permission to use aerial imagery from their [[Bing Maps]] service for tracing, Potlatch 2 was extended to display these images in the background.

[[iD (software)|iD]] (current default editor on main OpenStreetMap website) is in turn a reimplementation of Potlatch&amp;nbsp;2 architecture in [[JavaScript]].&lt;ref name="starts-editor"&gt;{{cite web|title=It all starts with an editor|last=Fairhurst|first=Richard|url=http://www.systemed.net/blog/index.php?post=24|accessdate=2012-11-02|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121023145335/http://www.systemed.net/blog/index.php?post=24|archivedate=2012-10-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=MacWright|first=Tom|title=iD Updates|url=http://mapbox.com/osmdev/2012/11/14/id-updates/|publisher=MapBox|accessdate=20 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''pro-War Left''' was a grouping of [[United Kingdom|British]] [[left wing]] [[journalists]] and [[blog]]gers who supported for the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]], at variance with much of the rest of the British [[Left-wing politics|left]] which opposed it.  They were centered on the [[Euston manifesto]].&lt;ref name=euston&gt;[http://eustonmanifesto.org/joomla/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=12&amp;Itemid=41 "The Euston Manifesto"], March 29, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; which in October 2007 had 2,929 signatories.  The name is derived from the pro-war group the Undertakers.

They have some similarity with US [[Liberal hawks]] and [[Anti-Germans (political current)|Anti-Germans]].

==Supporters==
The Pro-War Left can be seen as mainly a phenomenon of the [[blogosphere]]. Most of its supporters contribute to or run blogs, ''[[Harry's Place]]'' being the most well known and influential of these.

On October 7, 2007, a counter-demonstration&lt;ref&gt;[http://hurryupharry.bloghouse.net/archives/2007/10/08/pictures_from_the_al_quds_counter_demo.php]{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} From the Harry's place blog&lt;/ref&gt; to the [[Al-Quds]] march was organised by Harry’s Place to which all the Pro-War Left were invited. The organisers estimate that 100 people turned up over the course of the day.

As well as the Euston Manifesto there are other organisations that have been associated with the Pro-War Left such as [[Labour Friends of Iraq]], [[Unite Against Terror]], [[Democratiya]] and [[Engage (organization)|Engage]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6026">'''Randolph Street Gallery (RSG)''' was an [[alternative exhibition space]] in Chicago, Illinois, from 1979&lt;ref&gt;Artner, Alan G. "To market...as an alternative" Chicago Tribune (17 Aug 1979: B12)&lt;/ref&gt; until its closing in 1998 and a vital local force in the development of a variety of new art forms and the contemporary national and international arts milieu. Founded by two artists, Tish Miller and Sarah Schwartz, RSG began in Schwartz's living room, later moving to 853 W. Randolph Street on Chicago's west side.&lt;ref&gt;Obejas, Achy "A Requiem for Chicago's Incubator of Performance Art" Chicago Tribune (23 Feb 1998: 1)&lt;/ref&gt; The late 1970s, was a period when young artists in all disciplines were collectively founding visual and performing art organizations as alternatives to mainstream and commercial venues in many US cities.&lt;ref&gt;Warren, L. 1984. ''Alternative Spaces: A History in Chicago''. Chicago. Museum of Contemporary Art.&lt;/ref&gt; RSG was one of more than a dozen 'alternative' galleries - along with many new 'alternative' theatre groups - situated on the near north and west sides of Chicago.  The gallery’s focus was on the needs of artists and practitioners who created work that was unsupported, or at the time, perceived to be unsupportable by most commercial or institutional funders.&lt;ref&gt;Obejas, Achy "A Requiem for Chicago's Incubator of Performance Art" Chicago Tribune (23 Feb 1998: 1)&lt;/ref&gt; Randolph Street Gallery was also the locus for groundbreaking collaborative projects such as The File Room: An Archive on Cultural Censorship, conceived by [[Antoni Muntadas]],&lt;ref&gt;Artner, Alan G. Muntadas' Installation Fits Current Thinking" Chicago Tribune (27 May 1994: 64)&lt;/ref&gt; and was the publisher of P-Form: Performance Art Magazine.&lt;ref&gt;P-Form: performance art news https://digitalcollections.saic.edu/pform&lt;/ref&gt;

For nineteen productive years RSG fulfilled its role as cultural laboratory for Chicago and the general art world.&lt;ref&gt;Hixson, Kathryn "Randolph Street Gallery" New Art Examiner (Sep 2000: 50-51) v28 n1&lt;/ref&gt;  By the late 1990s, changing trends, expectations, and patterns of patronage in the arts took their toll on the gallery as well as on any of the other few comparable artist-run organizations in the United States (e.g., La Mamelle and the Capp Street Project in San Francisco, the Washington Project for the Arts in the District of Columbia) and the gallery eventually closed.&lt;ref&gt;Obejas, Achy "Randolph Street Gallery Closes, Victim of Rapidly Declining Funds" Chicago Tribune (14 Feb 1998: 5)&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the emerging and mid-career artists who presented and experimented at Randolph Street Gallery are now recognized as leaders who have changed the context of our cultural dialog. They include visual and performance artists, photographers, filmmakers, sound and video artists, writers and curators.&lt;ref&gt;Hixson, Kathryn "Randolph Street Gallery" New Art Examiner (Sep 2000: 50-51) v28 n1&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, the complete archives of Randolph Street Gallery were donated to the [[School of the Art Institute of Chicago]] (SAIC) and include all available material documenting the nineteen-year history of RSG, a high percentage of which are original source materials. The archives contain historical records of performance, sculpture, visual and other art forms created or presented by local and international artists, artists’ portfolios, slides, posters, signage, photographs, [[performance art]] programs, publications, news clippings, publicity files, a variety of video formats, sound recordings, computer files, administrative records, and some works of art donated to Randolph Street Gallery for auctions and fund raisers.&lt;ref&gt;Randolph Street Gallery Archives  http://libraryguides.saic.edu/rsga&lt;/ref&gt;  Public access to the archives is possible on a limited basis and by reservation only.
The Randolph Street Gallery Archives are complemented by an additional 33 linear feet of archival material from the editors of P-Form: Performance Art Magazine.

In [[computing]], a [[computer program]] or [[subroutine]] is called '''reentrant''' if it can be interrupted in the middle of its execution and then safely be called again ("re-entered") before its previous invocations complete execution. The interruption could be caused by an internal action such as a jump or call, or by an external action such as an [[interrupt]] or [[signal (computing)|signal]]. Once the reentered invocation completes, the previous invocations will resume correct execution.

This definition originates from single-threaded programming environments where the flow of control could be interrupted by an [[interrupt]] and transferred to an [[interrupt service routine]] (ISR). Any subroutine used by the ISR that could potentially have been executing when the interrupt was triggered should be reentrant. Often, subroutines accessible via the operating system [[kernel (computing)|kernel]] are not reentrant. Hence, interrupt service routines are limited in the actions they can perform; for instance, they are usually restricted from accessing the file system and sometimes even from allocating memory.

This definition of reentrancy differs from that of [[thread-safety]] in multi-threaded environments. A reentrant subroutine can achieve thread-safety,{{sfn|Kerrisk|2010|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=2SAQAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA657 657]}} but being reentrant alone might not be sufficient to be thread-safe in all situations. Conversely, thread-safe code does not necessarily have to be reentrant (see below for examples).

Other terms used for reentrant programs include "pure procedure" or "sharable code".{{sfn|Ralston|2000|p=1514–1515}}

Reentrancy of a subroutine that operates on operating-system resources or non-local data depends on the [[atomicity (programming)|atomicity]] of the respective operations. For example, if the subroutine modifies a 64-bit global variable on a 32-bit machine, the operation may be split into two 32-bit operations, and thus, if the subroutine is interrupted while executing, and called again from the interrupt handler, the global variable may be in a state where only 32 bits have been updated. The programming language might provide atomicity guarantees for interruption caused by an internal action such as a jump or call. Then the function {{code|f}} in an expression like &lt;code&gt;(global:=1) + (f())&lt;/code&gt;, where the order of evaluation of the subexpressions might be arbitrary in a programming language, would see the global variable either set to 1 or to its previous value, but not in an intermediate state where only part has been updated. (The latter can happen in [[C programming language|C]], because the expression has no [[sequence point]].) The operating system might provide atomicity guarantees for [[signal (computing)|signals]], such as a system call interrupted by a signal not having a partial effect. The processor hardware might provide atomicity guarantees for [[interrupt]]s, such as interrupted processor instructions not having partial effects.

==Examples==
To illustrate reentrancy, this article uses as an example a [[C (programming language)|C]] utility function, {{code|swap()}}, that takes two pointers and transposes their values, and an interrupt-handling routine that also calls the swap function.

===Neither reentrant nor thread-safe===
This is an example swap function that fails to be reentrant or thread-safe. As such, it should not have been used in the interrupt service routine &lt;code&gt;isr()&lt;/code&gt;:

&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
int tmp;

void swap(int* x, int* y)
{
    tmp = *x;
    *x = *y;
    *y = tmp;    /* Hardware interrupt might invoke isr() here. */
}

void isr()
{
    int x = 1, y = 2;
    swap(&amp;x, &amp;y);
}
&lt;/source&gt;

===Thread-safe but not reentrant===
The function {{code|swap()}} in the preceding example can be made thread-safe by making {{code|tmp}} [[Thread-local storage|thread-local]]. It still fails to be reentrant, and this will continue to cause problems if {{code|isr()}} is called in the same context as a thread already executing {{code|swap()}}:

&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
_Thread_local int tmp;

void swap(int* x, int* y)
{
    tmp = *x;
    *x = *y;
    *y = tmp;    /* Hardware interrupt might invoke isr() here. */
}

void isr()
{
    int x = 1, y = 2;
    swap(&amp;x, &amp;y);
}
&lt;/source&gt;

===Reentrant but not thread-safe===
The following (somewhat contrived) modification of the swap function, which is careful to leave the global data in a consistent state at the time it exits, is reentrant; however, it is not thread-safe, since it does not ensure the global data is in a consistent state during execution:

&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
int tmp;

void swap(int* x, int* y)
{
    /* Save global variable. */
    int s;
    s = tmp;

    tmp = *x;
    *x = *y;
    *y = tmp;     /* Hardware interrupt might invoke isr() here. */

    /* Restore global variable. */
    tmp = s;
}

void isr()
{
    int x = 1, y = 2;
    swap(&amp;x, &amp;y);
}
&lt;/source&gt;

===Reentrant and thread-safe===
An implementation of {{code|swap()}} that allocates {{code|tmp}} on the [[call stack|stack]] instead of on the [[heap (programming)|heap]] is both thread-safe and reentrant:

&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
void swap(int* x, int* y)
{
    int tmp;
    tmp = *x;
    *x = *y;
    *y = tmp;    /* Hardware interrupt might invoke isr() here. */
}

void isr()
{
    int x = 1, y = 2;
    swap(&amp;x, &amp;y);
}
&lt;/source&gt;

==Background==
Reentrancy is not the same thing as [[idempotence]], in which the function may be called more than once yet generate exactly the same output as if it had only been called once. Generally speaking, a function produces output data based on some input data (though both are optional, in general). Shared data could be accessed by any function at any time. If data can be changed by any function (and none keep track of those changes), there is no guarantee to those that share a datum that that datum is the same as at any time before.

Data has a characteristic called [[Scope and extent|scope]], which describes where in a program the data may be used. Data scope is either [[global variable|global]] (outside the [[variable scope|scope]] of any function and with an indefinite extent) or [[Local variables, recursion and reentrancy|local]] (created each time a function is called and destroyed upon exit).

Local data is not shared by any routines, re-entering or not; therefore, it does not affect re-entrance. Global data is defined outside functions and can be accessed by more than one function, either in form of [[global variable]]s (data shared between all functions), or as [[static variable]]s (data shared by all functions of the same name). In [[object-oriented programming]], global data is defined in the scope of a class and can be private, making it accessible only to functions of that class. There is also the concept of [[instance variable]]s, where a class variable is bound to a class instance. For these reasons, in object-oriented programming, this distinction is usually reserved for the data accessible outside of the class (public), and for the data independent of class instances (static).

Reentrancy is distinct from, but closely related to, [[thread-safety]]. A function can be [[thread-safe]] and still not reentrant. For example, a function could be wrapped all around with a [[mutex]] (which avoids problems in multithreading environments), but, if that function were used in an interrupt service routine, it could starve waiting for the first execution to release the mutex. The key for avoiding confusion is that reentrant refers to only ''one'' thread executing. It is a concept from the time when no multitasking operating systems existed.

==Rules for reentrancy==
;Reentrant code may not hold any static or global non-constant data.
:Reentrant functions can work with global data. For example, a reentrant interrupt service routine could grab a piece of hardware status to work with (e.g., serial port read buffer) which is not only global, but volatile. Still, typical use of static variables and global data is not advised, in the sense that only [[atomic (computer science)|atomic]] [[read-modify-write]] instructions should be used in these variables (it should not be possible for an interrupt or signal to come during the execution of such an instruction). Note that in C, even a read or write is not guaranteed to be atomic; it may be split into several reads or writes.{{r|Preshing (2013)}} The C standard and SUSv3 provide &lt;code&gt;sig_atomic_t&lt;/code&gt; for this purpose, although with guarantees only for simple reads and writes, not for incrementing or decrementing.{{sfn|Kerrisk|2010|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=2SAQAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA428 428]}} More complex atomic operations are available in [[C11 (C standard revision)|C11]], which provides &lt;code&gt;stdatomic.h&lt;/code&gt;.
;Reentrant code may not [[self-modifying code|modify itself]].
:The operating system might allow a process to modify its code. There are various reasons for this (e.g., [[blitting]] graphics quickly) but this would cause a problem with reentrancy, since the code might not be the same next time.
:It may, however, modify itself if it resides in its own unique memory. That is, if each new invocation uses a different physical machine code location where a copy of the original code is made, it will not affect other invocations even if it modifies itself during execution of that particular invocation (thread).
;Reentrant code may not call non-reentrant [[computer program]]s or [[Subroutine|routines]].
:Multiple levels of user, object, or process [[Priority queue|priority]] or [[multiprocessing]] usually complicate the control of reentrant code. It is important to keep track of any access or side effects that are done inside a routine designed to be reentrant.

==Reentrant interrupt handler==
A reentrant interrupt handler is an [[interrupt handler]] that re-enables interrupts early in the interrupt handler. This may reduce [[interrupt latency]].{{sfn|Sloss|Symes|Wright|Rayfield|2004|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=vdk4ZGRqMskC&amp;pg=PA342 342]}} In general, while programming interrupt service routines, it is recommended to re-enable interrupts as soon as possible in the interrupt handler. This practice helps to avoid losing interrupts.{{r|Regehr (2006)}}

==Further examples==
In the following code, neither &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt; nor &lt;code&gt;g&lt;/code&gt; functions are reentrant.

&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
int v = 1;

int f()
{
    v += 2;
    return v;
}

int g()
{
    return f() + 2;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

In the above, {{code|f()}} depends on a non-constant global variable {{code|v}}; thus, if two threads execute it and access {{code|v}} concurrently, a [[race condition]] results. The value of {{code|v}} and, therefore, the return value of {{code|f}}, cannot be predicted with confidence: they will vary depending on the timing of the execution.{{clarify|date=May 2012|reason=This appears to be confusing reentrancy and thread-safety.}} Hence, {{code|f}} is not reentrant. Neither is {{code|g}}, because it calls {{code|f}}, which is not reentrant.

These slightly altered versions ''are'' reentrant:

&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
int f(int i)
{
    return i + 2;
}

int g(int i)
{
    return f(i) + 2;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

In the following, the function is thread-safe, but not reentrant:

&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
int function()
{
    mutex_lock();

    // ...
    // function body
    // ...

    mutex_unlock();
}
&lt;/source&gt;

In the above, {{code|function()}} can be called by different threads without any problem. But, if the function is used in a reentrant interrupt handler and a second interrupt arises inside the function, the second routine will hang forever. As interrupt servicing can disable other interrupts, the whole system could suffer.

'''''The Laws of Scotland: Stair Memorial Encyclopaedia''''' (commonly referred to as the ''Stair Memorial Encyclopaedia'') is an encyclopaedia of [[law in Scotland]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.open.ac.uk/find/books/ Stair Memorial Encyclopaedia listed at the Open University]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nyulawglobal.org/globalex/United_kingdom.htm GlobaLex]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alpn.edu.au/node/76 Australian Law Postgraduate Network]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.innertemplelibrary.org.uk/newsletter/Archive/newsletter7.doc Newsletter] of the Honourable Society of the [[Inner Temple]]&lt;/ref&gt;  It incorporates law derived from every [[Sources of law|source]] and, while concentrating on the specialities of Scots law, it also covers [[British law|law common]] to the whole of the [[United Kingdom]]. Each statement of law is supported by citation of authority, and there are references to sources of further information, both primary and secondary.  The Encyclopaedia may be cited with approval before the courts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wildy.com/isbn/9780406937438/the-laws-of-scotland-stair-memorial-encyclopaedia-reissue-service- Summary of Stair Memorial Encyclopaedia]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1981, three hundred years after [[James Dalrymple, 1st Viscount of Stair]]'s first publication of his original work, a new encyclopaedia of Scots law was commissioned.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.journalonline.co.uk/Magazine/53-9/1005670.aspx Law Society of Scotland Journal Online]&lt;/ref&gt;  The complete set consists of over 130 titles in 25 volumes and Reissue binders.  It covers the whole spectrum of Scots law, from [[Administrative Law]], through [[Criminal Law]], [[Obligation (law)|Obligations]] and [[Property law|Property]], to [[Wills]] and [[Inheritance|Succession]]. ''Stair Memorial Encyclopaedia'' is also available as a searchable electronic archive on a paid subscription basis.

'''''The Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture''''' is a [[reference book]] on the [[U.S. state]] of [[Tennessee]] that was published in book form in 1998 and has also been available online since 2002. Contents include [[history]], [[geography]], culture, and [[biography]].

The original print edition was developed as a [[Tennessee Historical Society]] educational project for the Tennessee state [[Anniversary|bicentennial]] in 1996. The idea of the encyclopedia was proposed in 1993 and work began the following year. The [[Tennessee General Assembly]] provided project funding in [[fiscal year]]s 1995 through 1998. Additional funding came from several [[Foundation (non-profit)|foundation]]s; [[Middle Tennessee State University]] provided some in-kind support.&lt;ref name=Forward&gt;[http://tennesseeencyclopedia.net/foreword.php Foreword], ''Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture'' website, accessed April 23, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; 

When the book was completed in 1998, it became the third state [[encyclopedia]] to be published in the United States. The print edition ({{ISBN|1558535993}} and {{ISBN|978-1-55853-599-2}}) has 1193 pages containing 1,534 entries contributed by 514 authors.&lt;ref name=Forward/&gt; It was a co-winner of a  Tennessee History Book Award and was recognized with a 1999 [[American Association for State and Local History]] (AASLH) Award of Merit.&lt;ref name=Westbio/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaslh.org/cgi-bin/awards.cgi?action=detail&amp;id=934 AASLH Award Winner Detail], AASLH website, accessed April 24, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

An online edition of the encyclopedia has been on the [[Internet]] since 2002. It includes the contents of the book plus some new entries and some [[multimedia]] content. The online edition is jointly produced and maintained by the Tennessee Historical Society and the [[University of Tennessee Press]].&lt;ref name=Forward/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://tennesseeencyclopedia.net/about.php About This Site], ''Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture'' website, accessed April 23, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Access to the full contents is free.&lt;ref name=THS/&gt; The online interface was revised and updated in February 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.utk.edu/tntoday/2011/03/09/tennessee-encyclopedia/ UT Press Helps Produce Updated Online Tennessee Encyclopedia], [[University of Tennessee]] press release, March 9, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Distinguish|Tertiary sector}}
A '''tertiary source''' is an index or textual consolidation of [[Primary source|primary]] and [[secondary source]]s.&lt;ref name="umd"&gt; [http://www.lib.umd.edu/ues/guides/primary-sources Primary, secondary and tertiary sources.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130703015116/http://www.lib.umd.edu/ues/guides/primary-sources |date=2013-07-03 }}". University Libraries, University of Maryland. Retrieve 07/26/2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lib.odu.edu/genedinfolit/1infobasics/tertiary_information_sources.html|title=Tertiary Information Sources|date=September 2012|publisher=Old Dominion University -- ODU Libraries|accessdate=20 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=JCU&gt;"[http://libguides.jcu.edu.au/tertiary Tertiary sources]". James Cook University.&lt;/ref&gt; Some tertiary sources are not to be used for academic [[research]], unless they can also be used as secondary sources, or to find other sources.&lt;ref name=newhaven&gt;"[http://libguides.newhaven.edu/content.php?pid=465151&amp;sid=3809011 Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary Resources]". University of New Haven.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overlap with secondary sources==
Depending on the topic of research, a scholar may use a [[bibliography]], [[dictionary]], or [[encyclopedia]] as either a tertiary or a secondary source.&lt;ref name="umd"&gt; [http://www.lib.umd.edu/ues/guides/primary-sources Primary, secondary and tertiary sources.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130703015116/http://www.lib.umd.edu/ues/guides/primary-sources |date=2013-07-03 }}". University Libraries, University of Maryland. Retrieve 07/26/2013&lt;/ref&gt; This causes difficulty in defining many sources as either one type or the other.

In some [[academic discipline]]s the differentiation between a secondary and tertiary source is relative.&lt;ref name="umd"/&gt;&lt;ref name=JCU /&gt; 

In the [[UNISIST model|United Nations International Scientific Information System (UNISIST) model]], a secondary source is a bibliography, whereas a tertiary source is a synthesis of primary sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Søndergaard | first1 = T. F. | last2 = Andersen | first2 = J. | last3 = Hjørland | first3 = B. | doi = 10.1108/00220410310472509 | title = Documents and the communication of scientific and scholarly information: Revising and updating the UNISIST model | journal = Journal of Documentation | volume = 59 | issue = 3 | pages = 278 | year = 2003 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of tertiary sources==
As tertiary sources, encyclopedias, [[textbook]]s, and [[compendium|compendia]] attempt to summarize, collect, and consolidate the source materials into an overview, but may also present subjective, or biased commentary and analysis (which are characteristics of secondary sources).

[[Bibliographic index|Indexes]], bibliographies, [[Concordance (publishing)|concordances]], and [[Database#Research|databases]] may not provide much textual information, but as aggregates of primary and secondary sources, they are often considered tertiary sources. So although tertiary sources are both primary and secondary, they are more towards a secondary source because of commentary and bias.

[[Almanac]]s, [[guide book|travel guides]], [[field guide]]s, and [[timeline]]s are also examples of tertiary sources.

Survey or overview articles are usually tertiary, though [[review articles]] in peer-reviewed [[academic journals]] are secondary (not be confused with film, book, etc. [[review]]s, which are primary-source opinions).

Some usually primary sources, such as [[User guide|user guides and manuals]], are secondary or tertiary (depending on the nature of the material) when written by third parties.

'''''The Communist Manifesto''''' (originally '''''Manifesto of the Communist Party''''') is an 1848 political pamphlet by the German philosophers [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]]. Commissioned by the [[Communist League]] and originally published in London (in German as ''Manifest der Kommunistischen Partei'') just as the [[revolutions of 1848]] began to erupt, the ''Manifesto'' was later recognised as one of the world's most influential political documents. It presents an analytical approach to the [[class struggle]] (historical and then-present) and the conflicts of [[capitalism]] and the capitalist mode of production, rather than a prediction of [[Communism|communism's]] potential future forms.

''The Communist Manifesto'' summarises Marx and Engels' theories concerning the nature of society and politics, that in their own words, "The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles". It also briefly features their ideas for how the [[Capitalism|capitalist]] society of the time would eventually be replaced by [[Socialist mode of production|socialism]]. Near the end of the Manifesto, the authors call for "forcible overthrow of all existing social conditions", which served as the justification for all communist revolutions around the world.

In 2013, ''The Communist Manifesto'' was registered to [[UNESCO]]'s [[Memory of the World Programme]] with ''[[Capital, Volume I]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.de/kommunikation/mow/mow-deutschland/kommunistisches-manifest.html Schriften von Karl Marx: "Das Minifest der Kommunistischen Partei" (1948) und "Das Kapital", ernster Band (1867)] ([[UNESCO]])&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
''The Communist Manifesto'' is divided into a preamble and four sections, the last of these a short conclusion. The introduction begins by proclaiming "A spectre is haunting Europe—the spectre of communism. All the powers of old Europe have entered into a holy alliance to exorcise this spectre". Pointing out that parties everywhere—including those in government and those in the opposition—have flung the "branding reproach of communism" at each other, the authors infer from this that the powers-that-be acknowledge [[communism]] to be a power in itself. Subsequently, the introduction exhorts Communists to openly publish their views and aims, to "meet this nursery tale of the spectre of communism with a manifesto of the party itself".

The first section of the ''Manifesto'', "Bourgeois and Proletarians", elucidates the [[materialist conception of history]], that "the history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles". Societies have always taken the form of an oppressed majority exploited under the yoke of an oppressive minority. In [[capitalism]], the industrial [[working class]], or ''[[proletariat]]'', engage in [[class struggle]] against the owners of the [[means of production]], the ''[[bourgeoisie]]''. As before, this struggle will end in a revolution that restructures society, or the "common ruin of the contending classes". The bourgeoisie, through the "constant revolutionising of production [and] uninterrupted disturbance of all social conditions" have emerged as the supreme class in society, displacing all the old powers of [[feudalism]]. The bourgeoisie constantly exploits the proletariat for its [[labour power]], creating profit for themselves and accumulating capital. However, in doing so, the bourgeoisie serves as "its own grave-diggers"; the proletariat inevitably will become conscious of their own potential and rise to power through revolution, overthrowing the bourgeoisie.

"Proletarians and Communists", the second section, starts by stating the relationship of conscious communists to the rest of the working class. The communists' party will not oppose other working-class parties, but unlike them, it will express the [[general will]] and defend the common interests of the world's proletariat as a whole, independent of all nationalities. The section goes on to defend communism from various objections, including claims that it advocates "[[free love]]" or disincentivises people from working. The section ends by outlining a set of short-term demands—among them a [[progressive income tax]]; abolition of inheritances and [[private property]]; abolition of [[child labour]]; free [[public education]]; nationalisation of the means of transport and communication; centralisation of credit via a national bank; expansion of publicly owned etc.—the implementation of which would result in the precursor to a stateless and [[classless society]].

The third section, "Socialist and Communist Literature", distinguishes communism from other socialist doctrines prevalent at the time—these being broadly categorised as Reactionary Socialism; Conservative or [[Bourgeois socialism|Bourgeois Socialism]]; and [[Utopian socialism|Critical-Utopian Socialism]] and Communism. While the degree of reproach toward rival perspectives varies, all are dismissed for advocating [[reformism]] and failing to recognise the pre-eminent revolutionary role of the working class. "Position of the Communists in Relation to the Various Opposition Parties", the concluding section of the ''Manifesto'', briefly discusses the communist position on struggles in specific countries in the mid-nineteenth century such as France, Switzerland, Poland, and Germany, this last being "on the eve of a bourgeois revolution", and predicts that a [[world revolution]] will soon follow. It ends by declaring an alliance with the [[The Mountain (1849)|social democrat]]s, boldly supporting other communist revolutions, and calling for united international proletarian action—[[Workers of the world, unite!|Working Men of All Countries, Unite!]].&lt;!--

==Writing==
[[File:Iishmarx.jpg|thumb|upright|Only surviving page from the first draft of the ''Manifesto'', handwritten by Marx]]

In spring 1847 Marx and Engels joined the [[League of the Just]], who were quickly convinced by the duo's ideas of "critical communism". At its First Congress in 2–9 June, the League tasked Engels with drafting a "profession of faith", but such a document was later deemed inappropriate for an open, non-confrontational organisation. Engels nevertheless wrote the "Draft of a Communist Confession of Faith", detailing the League's programme. A few months later, in October, Engels arrived at the League's Paris branch to find that [[Moses Hess]] had written an inadequate manifesto for the group, now called the League of Communists. In Hess's absence, Engels severely criticised this manifesto, and convinced the rest of the League to entrust him with drafting a new one. This became the draft ''[[Principles of Communism]]'', described as "less of a credo and more of an exam paper."

On 23 November, just before the Communist League's Second Congress (29 November – 8 December 1847), Engels wrote to Marx, expressing his desire to eschew the [[catechism]] format in favour of the manifesto, because he felt it "must contain some history." On the 28th, Marx and Engels met at [[Ostend]] in Belgium, and a few days later, gathered at the [[Soho]], London headquarters of the German Workers' Education Association to attend the Congress. Over the next ten days, intense debate raged between League functionaries; Marx eventually dominated the others and, overcoming "stiff and prolonged opposition",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Laski |first=Harold |author-link=Harold Laski|encyclopedia=Communist Manifesto: Socialist Landmark |title=Introduction  |year=1948 |publisher=[[George Allen and Unwin]] |page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Harold Laski]]'s words, secured a majority for his programme. The League thus unanimously adopted a far more combative resolution than that at the First Congress in June. Marx (especially) and Engels were subsequently commissioned to draw up a manifesto for the League.

Upon returning to Brussels, Marx engaged in "ceaseless procrastination", according to his biographer [[Francis Wheen]]. Working only intermittently on the manifesto, he spent much of his time delivering lectures on [[political economy]] at the German Workers' Education Association, writing articles for the ''[[Deutsche-Brüsseler-Zeitung]]'', and giving a long speech on [[free trade]]. Following this, he even spent a week (17–26 January 1848) in Ghent to establish a branch of the Democratic Association there. Subsequently, having not heard from Marx for nearly two months, the Central Committee of the Communist League sent him an ultimatum on 24 or 26 January, demanding he submit the completed manuscript by 1 February. This imposition spurred Marx on, who struggled to work without a deadline, and he seems to have rushed to finish the job in time. (For evidence of this, historian [[Eric Hobsbawm]] points to the absence of rough drafts, only one page of which survives.)

In all, the ''Manifesto'' was written over 6–7 weeks. Although Engels is credited as co-writer, the final draft was penned exclusively by Marx. From the 26 January letter, Laski infers that even the League considered Marx to be the sole draftsman (and that he was merely their agent, imminently replaceable). Further, Engels himself wrote in 1883 that "The basic thought running through the ''Manifesto'' ... belongs solely and exclusively to Marx." Although Laski doesn't disagree, he suggests that Engels underplays his own contribution with characteristic modesty, and points out the "close resemblance between its substance and that of the [''Principles of Communism'']". Laski argues that while writing the ''Manifesto'', Marx drew from the "joint stock of ideas" he developed with Engels, "a kind of intellectual bank account upon which either could draw freely."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Laski |first=Harold |author-link=Harold Laski|encyclopedia=Communist Manifesto: Socialist Landmark |title=Introduction  |year=1948 |publisher=[[George Allen and Unwin]]  |page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publication==

===Initial publication and obscurity, 1848–72===
[[File:Maerz1848 berlin.jpg|thumb|A scene from the German [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|March Revolution]] in Berlin, 1848]]

In late February 1848, the ''Manifesto'' was anonymously published by the Workers' Educational Association (''Communistischer Arbeiterbildungsverein'') at [[Bishopsgate]] in the [[City of London]]. Written in German, the 23-page pamphlet was titled ''Manifest der kommunistischen Partei'' and had a dark-green cover. It was reprinted three times and serialised in the ''Deutsche Londoner Zeitung'', a newspaper for German ''émigré''s. On 4 March, one day after the serialisation in the ''Zeitung'' began, Marx was expelled by Belgian police. Two weeks later, around 20 March, a thousand copies of the ''Manifesto'' reached Paris, and from there to Germany in early April. In April–May the text was corrected for printing and punctuation mistakes; Marx and Engels would use this 30-page version as the basis for future editions of the ''Manifesto''.

Although the ''Manifesto''{{'}}s prelude announced that it was "to be published in the English, French, German, Italian, Flemish and Danish languages", the initial printings were only in German. Polish and Danish translations soon followed the German original in London, and by the end of 1848, a Swedish translation was published with a new title—''The Voice of Communism: Declaration of the Communist Party''. In June–November 1850 the ''Manifesto of the Communist Party'' was published in English for the first time when [[George Julian Harney]] serialised [[Helen Macfarlane]]'s translation in his [[Chartism|Chartist]] magazine ''[[The Red Republican]]''. (Her version begins, "A frightful hobgoblin stalks throughout Europe. We are haunted by a ghost, the ghost of Communism.")&lt;ref&gt;Louise Yeoman. "[http://bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-20475989 Helen McFarlane – the radical feminist admired by Karl Marx]". [[BBC Scotland]]. 25 November 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; For her translation, the Lancashire-based Macfarlane probably consulted Engels, who had abandoned his own English translation half way. Harney's introduction revealed the ''Manifesto''{{'}}s hitherto-anonymous authors' identities for the first time.

[[File:1852 Der Koelner Kommunistenprozess.jpg|thumb|left|Immediately after the Cologne Communist Trial of late 1852, the Communist League disbanded itself.]]
Soon after the ''Manifesto'' was published, [[French Revolution of 1848|Paris erupted in revolution]] to overthrow King [[Louis Philippe]]. The ''Manifesto'' played no role in this; a French translation was not published in Paris until just before the working-class [[June Days Uprising]] was crushed.&lt;!-- shorten French stuff --&gt; Its influence in the Europe-wide [[revolutions of 1848]] was restricted to [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|Germany]], where the Cologne-based Communist League and its newspaper ''[[Neue Rheinische Zeitung]]'', edited by Marx, played an important role. Within a year of its establishment, in May 1849, the ''Zeitung'' was suppressed; Marx was expelled from Germany and had to seek lifelong refuge in London. In 1851, members of the Communist League's central board were arrested by the Prussian police. At their [[Cologne Communist Trial|trial in Cologne]] 18 months later in late 1852 they were sentenced to 3–6 years' imprisonment. For Engels, the revolution was "forced into the background by the reaction that began with the defeat of the Paris workers in June 1848, and was finally excommunicated 'by law' in the conviction of the Cologne Communists in November 1852".

After the defeat of the 1848 revolutions the ''Manifesto'' fell into obscurity, where it remained throughout the 1850s and 1860s. Hobsbawm says that by November 1850 the ''Manifesto'' "had become sufficiently scarce for Marx to think it worth reprinting section III ... in the last issue of his [short-lived] London magazine". Over the next two decades only a few new editions were published; these include an (unauthorised and occasionally inaccurate) 1869 Russian translation by [[Mikhail Bakunin]] in Geneva and an 1866 edition in Berlin—the first time the ''Manifesto'' was published in Germany. According to Hobsbawm, "By the middle 1860s virtually nothing that Marx had written in the past was any longer in print." However [[John Cowell-Stepney]] did publish an abridged version in the ''Social Economist'' in August/September 1869,&lt;ref name="DL"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Leopold|first1=David|editor1-last=Carver|editor1-first=Terrell|editor2-last=Farr|editor2-first=James|title=The Cambridge Companion to The Communist Manifesto|article=Marx Engels and Other Socialisms|date=2015|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt; in time for the [[Basle Congress (1869)|Basle Congress]].

===Rise, 1872–1917===
In the early 1870s, the ''Manifesto'' and its authors experienced a revival in fortunes. Hobsbawm identifies three reasons for this. The first is the leadership role Marx played in the [[International Workingmen's Association]] (aka the First International). Secondly, Marx also came into much prominence among socialists—and equal notoriety among the authorities—for his support of the [[Paris Commune]] of 1871, elucidated in ''[[The Civil War in France]]''. Lastly, and perhaps most significantly in the popularisation of the ''Manifesto'', was the treason trial of [[German Social Democratic Party]] (SPD) leaders. During the trial prosecutors read the ''Manifesto'' out loud as evidence; this meant that the pamphlet could legally be published in Germany. Thus in 1872 Marx and Engels rushed out a new German-language edition, writing a preface that identified that several portions that became outdated in the quarter century since its original publication. This edition was also the first time the title was shortened to ''The Communist Manifesto'' (''Das Kommunistische Manifest''), and it became the bedrock the authors based future editions upon. Between 1871 and 1873, the ''Manifesto'' was published in over nine editions in six languages; in 1872 it was published in the United States for the first time, serialised in ''[[Woodhull &amp; Claflin's Weekly]]'' of New York City. However, by the mid 1870s the ''Communist Manifesto'' remained Marx and Engels' only work to be even moderately well-known.

Over the next forty years, as [[Social democracy|social-democratic parties]] rose across Europe and parts of the world, so did the publication of the ''Manifesto'' alongside them, in hundreds of editions in thirty languages. Marx and Engels wrote a new preface for the 1882 Russian edition, translated by [[Georgi Plekhanov]] in Geneva. In it they wondered if Russia could directly become a [[communist society]], or if she would become capitalist first like other European countries. After Marx's death in 1883, Engels alone provided the prefaces for five editions between 1888 and 1893. Among these is the 1888 English edition, translated by Samuel Moore and approved by Engels, who also provided notes throughout the text. It has been the standard English-language edition ever since.

The principal region of its influence, in terms of editions published, was in the "central belt of Europe", from Russia in the east to France in the west. In comparison, the pamphlet had little impact on politics in southwest and southeast Europe, and moderate presence in the north. Outside Europe, Chinese and Japanese translations were published, as were Spanish editions in Latin America. This uneven geographical spread in the ''Manifesto''{{'}}s popularity reflected the development of socialist movements in a particular region as well as the popularity of Marxist variety of socialism there. There was not always a strong correlation between a social-democratic party's strength and the ''Manifesto''{{'}}s popularity in that country. For instance, the German SPD printed only a few thousand copies of the ''Communist Manifesto'' every year, but a few hundred thousand copies of the ''[[Erfurt Programme]]''. Further, the mass-based social-democratic parties of the [[Second International]] did not require their rank and file to be well-versed in theory; Marxist works such as the ''Manifesto'' or ''[[Das Kapital]]'' were read primarily by party theoreticians. On the other hand, small, dedicated militant parties and Marxist sects in the West took pride in knowing the theory; Hobsbawm says "This was the milieu in which 'the clearness of a comrade could be gauged invariably from the number of earmarks on his Manifesto{{' "}}.

===Ubiquity, 1917–present===
[[File:Kustodiev The Bolshevik.jpg|thumb|{{Nowrap|''The Bolshevik'' (1920) by [[Boris Kustodiev]].}} Following the 1917 Bolshevik takeover of Russia Marx/Engels classics like the ''Communist Manifesto'' were distributed far and wide.]]

Following the [[October Revolution]] of 1917 that swept the [[Vladimir Lenin]]-led [[Bolsheviks]] to power in Russia, the world's first [[socialist state]] was founded explicitly along Marxist lines. The [[Soviet Union]], which [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Bolshevik Russia]] would become a part of, was a [[one-party state]] under the rule of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] (CPSU). Unlike their mass-based counterparts of the Second International, the CPSU and other [[Vanguard party|Leninist parties]] like it in the [[Third International]] expected their members to know the classic works of Marx, Engels and Lenin. Further, party leaders were expected to base their policy decisions on [[Marxist-Leninist]] ideology. Therefore works such as the ''Manifesto'' were required reading for the party rank-and-file.

Therefore the widespread dissemination of Marx and Engels' works became an important policy objective; backed by a sovereign state, the CPSU had relatively inexhaustible resources for this purpose. Works by Marx, Engels, and Lenin were published on a very large scale, and cheap editions of their works were available in several languages across the world. These publications were either shorter writings or they were compendia such as the various editions of Marx and Engels' ''Selected Works'', or their ''[[Marx/Engels Collected Works|Collected Works]]''. This affected the destiny of the ''Manifesto'' in several ways. Firstly, in terms of circulation; in 1932 the [[Communist Party USA|American]] and [[British Communist Party|British Communist Parties]] printed several hundred thousand copies of a cheap edition for "probably the largest mass edition ever issued in English". Secondly the work entered political-science syllabuses in universities, which would only expand after the Second World War. For its centenary in 1948, its publication was no longer the exclusive domain of Marxists and academicians; general publishers too printed the ''Manifesto'' in large numbers. "In short, it was no longer only a classic Marxist document," Hobsbawm noted, "it had become a political classic ''tout court''."

Even after the collapse of the Soviet Bloc in the 1990s, the ''Communist Manifesto'' remains ubiquitous; Hobsbawm says that "In states without censorship, almost certainly anyone within reach of a good bookshop, and certainly anyone within reach of a good library, not to mention the internet, can have access to it." The 150th anniversary once again brought a deluge of attention in the press and the academia, as well as new editions of the book fronted by introductions to the text by academics. One of these, ''The Communist Manifesto: A Modern Edition'' by Verso, was touted by a critic in the ''[[London Review of Books]]'' as being a "stylish red-ribboned edition of the work. It is designed as a sweet keepsake, an exquisite collector's item. In Manhattan, a prominent [[Fifth Avenue]] store put copies of this choice new edition in the hands of shop-window mannequins, displayed in come-hither poses and fashionable [[décolletage]]."&lt;!--

A number of late-20th- and 21st-century writers have commented on the ''Communist Manifesto''{{'}}s continuing relevance. In a special issue of the ''[[Socialist Register]]'' commemorating the ''Manifesto''{{'}}s 150th anniversary, [[Peter Osborne (writer and academic)|Peter Osborne]] argued that it was 'the single most influential text written in the nineteenth century.'&lt;ref&gt;Osborne, Peter. 1998.

Retrieved November 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Academic John Raines in 2002 noted that "In our day this Capitalist Revolution has reached the farthest corners of the earth. The tool of money has produced the miracle of the new global market and the ubiquitous shopping mall.

''Marx on Religion'' (Marx, Karl). Philadelphia: Temple University Press. p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, the English Marxist [[Chris Harman]] stated, "There is still a compulsive quality to its prose as it provides insight after insight into the society in which we live, where it comes from and where its going to. It is still able to explain, as mainstream economists and sociologists cannot, today's world of recurrent wars and repeated economic crisis, of hunger for hundreds of millions on the one hand and 'overproduction' on the other.

In contrast, critics such as [[Revisionism (Marxism)|Revisionist Marxist]] and reformist socialist [[Eduard Bernstein]] distinguished between "immature" early Marxism—as exemplified by the ''Communist Manifesto'' written by Marx and Engels in their youth—that he opposed for its violent [[Blanquism|Blanquist]] tendencies, and later "mature" Marxism that he supported.&lt;ref name="Steger, Manfred B. 1997. pg. 236-237"&gt;Steger, Manfred B. ''The Quest for Evolutionary Socialism: Eduard Bernstein And Social Democracy''. Cambridge, England, UK; New York City, USA: Cambridge University Press, 1997. pp. 236–37.&lt;/ref&gt; This latter form refers to Marx in his later life acknowledging that socialism could be achieved through peaceful means through legislative reform in democratic societies.&lt;ref&gt;[[Micheline Ishay|Micheline R. Ishay]]. The History of Human Rights: From Ancient Times to the Globalization Era. Berkeley and Lose Angeles, California: University of California Press, 2008. p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt; Bernstein declared that the massive and homogeneous working-class claimed in the ''Communist Manifesto'' did not exist, and that contrary to claims of a proletarian majority emerging, the middle-class was growing under capitalism and not disappearing as Marx had claimed. Bernstein noted that the working-class was not homogeneous but heterogeneous, with divisions and factions within it, including socialist and non-socialist trade unions. Marx himself, later in his life, acknowledged that the middle-class was not disappearing in his work ''[[Theories of Surplus Value]]'' (1863). The obscurity of the later work means that Marx's acknowledgement of this error is not well known.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Harrington. ''Socialism: Past and Future''. Reprint edition of original published in 1989. New York City: Arcade Publishing, 2011. pp. 249–50.&lt;/ref&gt; [[George Boyer]] described the ''Manifesto'' as "very much a period piece, a document of what was called the 'hungry' 1840s."&lt;ref name = "Boyer 1998 151"&gt;{{Harvnb|Boyer|1998|p=151}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many have drawn attention to the passage in the ''Manifesto'' that seems to sneer at the stupidity of the rustic: "The bourgeoisie ... draws all nations ... into civilisation ... It has created enormous cities ... and thus rescued a considerable part of the population from the idiocy [sic!] of rural life".&lt;ref&gt;The ''[sic!]'' is that of [[Joseph Schumpeter]]; see {{Harvnb|Schumpeter|1997|p=8 n2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; As [[Eric Hobsbawm]] noted, however:

{{Quote|[W]hile there is no doubt that Marx at this time shared the usual townsman's contempt for, as well as ignorance of, the peasant milieu, the actual and analytically more interesting German phrase ("dem Idiotismus des Landlebens entrissen") referred not to "stupidity" but to "the narrow horizons", or "the isolation from the wider society" in which people in the countryside lived. It echoed the original meaning of the Greek term ''idiotes'' from which the current meaning of "idiot" or "idiocy" is derived, namely "a person concerned only with his own private affairs and not with those of the wider community". In the course of the decades since the 1840s, and in movements whose members, unlike Marx, were not classically educated, the original sense was lost and was misread.&lt;ref name = "Hobsbawm 108"&gt;{{Harvnb|Hobsbawm|2011|p=108}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Influences==
Marx and Engels’ [[Influences on Karl Marx|political influences]] were wide-ranging, reacting to and taking inspiration from German idealist philosophy, French socialism, and English and Scottish political economy. ''The Communist Manifesto'' also takes influence from literature. In [[Jacques Derrida]]’s work, ''[[Specters of Marx]]: The State of the Debt, the Work of Mourning and the New International'', he uses [[Shakespeare]]’s ''[[Hamlet]]'' to frame a discussion of the history of the International, showing, in the process, the influence that Shakespeare’s work had on Marx and Engel’s writing.&lt;ref&gt;Derrida, Jacques. “[https://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/philosophy/works/fr/derrida2.htm What is Ideology?]” in ''Specters of Marx, the state of the debt, the Work of Mourning, &amp; the New International'', translated by Peggy Kamuf, Routledge 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; In his essay, “Big Leagues: Specters of Milton and Republican International Justice between Shakespeare and Marx,” Christopher N. Warren makes the case that English poet [[John Milton]] also had a substantial influence on Marx and Engel’s work.&lt;ref&gt;Warren, Christopher N (2016). “[https://dx.doi.org/10.17613/M6VW8W Big Leagues: Specters of Milton and Republican International Justice between Shakespeare and Marx.]” ''Humanity: An International Journal of Human Rights, Humanitarianism, and Development'', Vol. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Historians of 19th-century reading habits have confirmed that Marx and Engels would have read these authors, and it is known that Marx loved Shakespeare, in particular.&lt;ref&gt;Rose, Jonathan (2001). [https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Intellectual_Life_of_the_British_Wor.html?id=3B-qbvQTYyEC ''The Intellectual Life of the British Working Classes'']. Pgs. 26, 36-37, 122-25, 187.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Antony (2002). “Shakespeare and Radicalism: The Uses and Abuses of Shakespeare in Nineteenth-Century Popular Politics.” ''Historical Journal 45'', no. 2. Pgs. 357-79.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marx, Karl (1844). “[[On the Jewish Question]].”&lt;/ref&gt; Milton, Warren argues, also shows a notable influence on ''The Communist Manifesto'': “Looking back on Milton’s era, Marx saw a historical dialectic founded on inspiration in which freedom of the press, republicanism, and revolution were closely joined.”&lt;ref&gt;Warren, Christopher N (2016). “[https://dx.doi.org/10.17613/M6VW8W Big Leagues: Specters of Milton and Republican International Justice between Shakespeare and Marx].” ''Humanity: An International Journal of Human Rights, Humanitarianism, and Development'', Vol. 7. Pg. 372.&lt;/ref&gt; Milton’s [[republicanism]], Warren continues, served as "a useful, if unlikely, bridge" as Marx and Engels sought to forge a revolutionary international coalition.

The '''ultimate attribution error''' is a group-level [[Attribution bias|attribution error]] that offers an explanation for how one person views different causes of negative and positive behavior in [[Ingroups and outgroups|ingroup and outgroup]] members.&lt;ref name="Pettigrew (T.F)"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pettigrew|first=T. F.|title=The ultimate attribution error: Extending Allport's cognitive analysis of prejudice|journal=[[Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin]]|year=1979|volume=5|issue=4|pages=461–476|doi=10.1177/014616727900500407}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
==Definition== 
Ultimate attribution error is the tendency to internally attribute negative outgroup and positive ingroup behaviour and to externally attribute positive outgroup and negative ingroup behaviour. So in other words, ultimate attribution error arises as a way to explain an outgroup's negative behaviour as flaws in their [[personality]], and to explain an outgroup's positive behaviour as a result of chance or circumstance. It is also the belief that positive acts performed by ingroup members are as a result of their personality, whereas, if an ingroup member behaves negatively (which is believed to be rare), it is a result of situational factors.&lt;ref name="Hewstone (1989)"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hewstone|first=M.|title=Causal attribution: From cognitive processes to collective beliefs|year=1989|publisher=Blackwell|location=Basil}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The ultimate attribution error was first established by Thomas F. Pettigrew in his 1979 publication "The Ultimate Attribution Error: Extending Allport's Cognitive Analysis of Prejudice".&lt;ref name="Pettigrew (T.F)" /&gt; As the title suggests, the ultimate attribution error is a theoretical extension of [[Gordon Allport]]'s work in [[Attribution (psychology)|attribution theory]].

The ultimate attribution error is a systematic patterning of intergroup misattributions shaped in part by one's prejudices. Prejudiced individuals are more likely to attribute an outgroup member's negative behaviors to dispositional, internal (possibly [[Genetics|genetically]] determined), causes. These same prejudiced individuals are also more likely to attribute outgroup member's positive behaviours to (a) "exceptional case", (b) fluke or special advantage, (c) high levels of motivation, or (d) situational context causes. Through these explanations, a prejudiced individual may disassociate a positive behavior from an outgroup individual and their group. In comparison, one is more likely to attribute negative ingroup behaviors to external causes and positive ingroup behaviors to dispositional causes.{{cn|date=February 2015}}

In general, anyone may commit the ultimate attribution error. However, it is most likely to happen to individuals who possess negative prejudices and [[stereotype]]s toward an outgroup. This attribution is considered a root of prejudice, as people who commit this attribution will usually see members of other [[Race (human classification)|races]], [[religion]]s, cultures, or even [[social class]] as dispositionally inferior or flawed, while people from their own racial, cultural, or religious ingroup, upon committing the same negative behaviors, are seen as good people who are dealing with specific situations the best they can. This reduces the acceptance of outgroup members, as any positive behaviors are downplayed and negative behaviors are highlighted.{{cn|date=February 2015}}

==Explaining away positive behavior of outgroup members==
[[File:UAE-EA.png|thumb|Explaining away positive behavior in outgroup members.]]
The attribution of outgroup members' positive behavior is classically categorized into four categories, created at the intersection of perceived degree of controllability of act (low vs high) and perceived [[locus of control]] of act (internal vs external).{{cn|date=February 2015}}

===Exceptional case===

The "exceptional case" explanation is created at the intersection of low controllability of act and internal locus of control. Using this mode of reasoning, an individual excludes the particular outgroup member from the outgroup. That is, they individuate the outgroup member, disassociating them from the group. This view allows for the maintenance of prejudiced beliefs through categorizing the "good" member as an exceptional case, while the other members of their group are still seen as "bad".{{cn|date=February 2015}}

===Luck or special advantage===

The "luck or special advantage" explanation is created at the intersection of low-perceived controllability of act and external locus of control. This reasoning suggest that the outgroup member's positive behavior is not rooted in their skill, ability, or hard work. Rather, their positive outcome is beyond their immediate control and therefore of little significance. "Special advantage" extends this by suggesting that their group affiliation offers some advantage, and therefore the positive outcome is again of little significance.{{cn|date=February 2015}}

===Highly motivated===

The "highly motivated" explanation is created at the intersection of high-perceived controllability of act and internal locus of control. Similar to the exceptional case, the highly motivated explanation individuates the outgroup member and dissociates them from their group. The outgroup member's positive behavior is rooted in their drive to be seen as anti-stereotypic, an external force. Thus, they are not seen as intrinsically exceptional, but externally motivated, and, without this motivation, they would not be able to achieve success. That is, an outgroup member's positive behavior is evidence of their response to external pressures of their interaction with ingroup other. Therefore, without an external source of motivation, the outgroup member is just like any other low-achieving, negative-behavior outgroup member.{{cn|date=February 2015}}

Similar to the "exceptional case" explanation, this explanation allows for the maintenance of prejudiced beliefs. That is, the highly motivated outgroup member is seen as hard working, so there must be something wrong with the rest of them.

===Situational===

The "situational" explanation is created at the intersection of high-perceived controllability of act and external control of the act. An outgroup member's positive outcome is not rooted in their effort or ability, but a result of external situational factors that are, at least in some part, influenced by others. Therefore, their positive behavior is not their own, and is of little consequence.{{cn|date=February 2015}}

==Evidence==
{{undue|date=February 2015}}
The ultimate attribution error is evidenced in a number of studies. Taylor and Jaggi (1974) found results supporting the ultimate attribution error in the causal attributions between religious ingroup and outgroup members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Taylor|first=D. M|author2=Jaggi |title=Ethnocentrism and Causal attribution in a South Indian Context|journal=[[Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology]]|year=1974|volume=5|pages=162–171|doi=10.1177/002202217400500202}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2x2 [[between-group design]], [[Hindu]] or [[Muslim]] participants were asked to make casual attributions for undesirable acts performed by Hindus or Muslims. Hindus attributed external causes to undesirable acts committed by fellow Hindus, but an internal cause for undesirable acts committed by Muslims. Conversely, Muslims attributed external causes to undesirable acts committed by fellow Muslims, but an internal cause for undesirable acts committed by Hindus. While Pettigrew and many others to follow would focus on race, this study offered clear evidence that similar mechanisms are at play among religious groups.

Prior to Pettigrew's formalization of the ultimate attribution error, Birt Duncan (1976) found that [[White people|White]] participants viewed [[Black people|Black]] individuals as more violent than White individuals in an "ambiguous shove" situation, where a Black or White person accidentally shoves a White person.&lt;ref name="Duncan 1976 75–93"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Duncan|first= B. L.|title= Differential social perception and attribution if intergroup violence: Testing the lower limits of stereotyping of Blacks|journal= [[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]]|year= 1976|volume= 34|issue= 4|pages= 75–93|doi= 10.1037/0022-3514.34.4.590}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2x2 between-group design, White participants viewed a Black or White individual (harm-doer) ambiguously shoving a Black or White individual (victim). In general, when a Black harm-doer shoved another person (whether they were Black or White), their behavior was attributed their high dispositional levels of violence (internal). On the other hand, when a White harm-doer shoved another person (whether they were Black or White), their behavior was generally attributed to external constraints. The results suggested that the White students participating in the experiment possessed a lower threshold for labeling a behavior as violent when the harm-doer is Black (outgroup) than when the harm-doer is White (ingroup).

Morris and Peng (1994) find support for Pettigrew's ultimate attribution error in a comparison of casual attributions made by ingroup and outgroup members about a murder carried out by an ingroup or outgroup assailant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= Morris|first= Michael W.|last2= Peng|first2= Kaiping|date= 1994|title=Culture and cause: American and Chinese attributions for social and physical events|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume= 67|issue= 6|pages= 949–971|doi= 10.1037/0022-3514.67.6.949}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2x2 between-group design, American or Chinese participants learned about a recent murder committed by an American or Chinese individual. They received the media coverage for the murder and were asked to weight the dispositional and situational explanations for the cause of the number. As the ultimate attribution error predicts, American participants were biased toward dispositional explanations for the Chinese murder suspect, and biased toward situational explanations for the American murder suspect. Similarly, the Chinese participants attributed dispositional causes for the American murder suspect and situational causes for the Chinese murder suspect.

Together, these three studies (Taylor and Jaggi's, Duncan's, and Morris and Peng's) establish the foundation of the ultimate attribution error and support its general prediction that negative behaviors by outgroup members are more likely to be attributed to internal causes than negative behaviors of ingroup members. Many other studies have been published using the ultimate attribution error as a theoretical foundation.

Supporting this general statement, a meta-analysis of 19 ultimate attribution error studies was published in 1990.&lt;ref name="Hewstone 1990"&gt;{{cite journal|last= Hewstone|first= Miles|year= 1990|title= The 'ultimate attribution error'? A review of the literature on intergroup causal attribution|journal= [[European Journal of Social Psychology]]|volume= 20|pages= 311–335|doi= 10.1002/ejsp.2420200404}}&lt;/ref&gt; The meta-analysis offers limited support for Pettigrew's ultimate attribution error. Specifically, it finds support for three aspects of the ultimate attribution error:
*more internal attribution for positive acts, and less internal attribution for negative acts, by ingroup than outgroup members;
*more attribution of outgroup members' failures to lack of ability, and more explaining away of outgroup members' successes;
*a preference for ingroup-serving versus outgroup-serving attributions for group differences.

[[File:Villa i tatti, giardino all'italiana 10.JPG|thumb|The villa from the gardens]]
[[File:Villa i tatti, ext., giardino 05.JPG|thumb|The gardens]]
'''Villa I Tatti, The Harvard Center for Italian Renaissance Studies''' is a center for advanced research in the humanities located in [[Florence]], [[Italy]], and belongs to [[Harvard University]]. It also houses a library and an art collection, and it is the site of Italian and English gardens. Villa I Tatti is located on an estate of olive groves, vineyards, and gardens on the border of [[Florence]], [[Fiesole]] and [[Settignano]].

Villa I Tatti is not generally open to the public.&lt;ref&gt;http://itatti.harvard.edu/visitor-information&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
For almost sixty years Villa I Tatti was the home of [[Bernard Berenson]] (1865–1959), the connoisseur whose attributions of early [[Italian Renaissance]] painting guided scholarship and collecting in this field for the first half of the twentieth century. It houses the Berenson collection of Italian primitives, and of Chinese and Islamic art, as well as a research library of 140,000 volumes and a collection of 250,000 photographs.

In 1900 Bernard Berenson married [[Mary Berenson|Mary Whitall Pearsall Smith]], who had formerly been married to the British politician, Frank Costelloe. Mary Berenson came from a liberal Quaker family from Philadelphia, and had two daughters from her previous marriage, but the marriage to Berenson remained childless. The couple moved to I Tatti shortly before their marriage, first renting the property from the expatriate English aristocrat, [[John Temple Leader]], and then in 1907 buying it outright from Temple Leader’s heir, Lord Westbury. Between 1907 and 1915 the seventeenth-century farmhouse became a Renaissance-style villa under the direction of the English architect and writer [[Geoffrey Scott (architectural historian)|Geoffrey Scott]], while a formal garden in the Anglo-Italian Renaissance style was laid out by the English landscape architect [[Cecil Pinsent]].

Berenson envisaged Villa I Tatti as a “lay monastery” for the leisurely study of Mediterranean culture through its art. He was against academic production, specialization, degrees, and what are now called in the Italian academic world “titoli”, and instead prized the slow maturing of ideas in tranquil contemplation. He considered his own achievement to lie as much in conversation as in writing.

Berenson died at the age of 94 in 1959 after bequeathing the estate, the collection, and the library to Harvard University. “Villa I Tatti, The Harvard Center for Italian Renaissance Studies”, as it was officially named, opened its doors to six fellows in 1961. In the intervening five decades since then it has welcomed over 700 fellows and visiting scholars from the United States and Canada, almost all of the European countries east and west, as well as Japan and Australia.

===The Berensons and Harvard===
Berenson’s esteem for Harvard dated from his youth. He arrived in Boston at age ten as a poor Jewish immigrant from Lithuania. His brilliance was soon recognized and, after finishing the Boston Latin School and completing a year at Boston University, he was supported through Harvard College by wealthier members of Boston society, graduating with the class of 1887. His interests there were in literature and ancient and oriental languages. He trained himself as a connoisseur of early Italian painting by travel throughout Europe and especially Italy, beginning in 1887. As early as 1915 he expressed his intention to leave his house and library to Harvard, and he reaffirmed his intention in 1937, in a letter published in the fiftieth-anniversary volume of his Harvard class.&lt;ref&gt;''Harvard College Class of 1887: Fiftieth Anniversary Report'', Cambridge, 1937, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Fascism, war, and post-war travail in Italy led Harvard to hesitate, and the bequest was only formally accepted by the Harvard Corporation at the time of Berenson’s death in 1959,&lt;ref&gt;Janet Tassel, “Viva I Tatti....and the Ghost of Bernard Berenson Within”, ''The Harvard Magazine'', March–April 1994, pp. 34–41.&lt;/ref&gt; opening its doors to the first class of fellows in 1961.

==Green Garden at Villa I Tatti==
The garden was created by the then young and inexperienced garden designer Cecil Pinsent. Pinsent had been touring Tuscany making topographic drawings of buildings together with his friend [[Geoffrey Scott (architectural historian)|Geoffrey Scott]]; they were both hired through Scott's connection with Berenson's wife, [[Mary Berenson|Mary]]. I Tatti was to become a formidable test, through which Pinsent could become a recognized specialist of the formal garden.

The Green Garden at I Tatti was Pinsent's first attempt to recreate a garden in the early Renaissance style. It was conceived as an outdoor extension of the house, an unfolding sequence, designed with the open intention of reviving the Italian style&lt;ref&gt;The Florentine Villa: Architecture History Society; By Grazia Gobbi Sica; page 94&lt;/ref&gt; The steep slopes were made into terraced "floors" and the walkways and stairways that connect the various floors were paved with mosaics of cobblestones. A large water tank enables "english style" lawns. Tall cypress trees screen the garden and box hedges divide its compartments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cei|first1=Marco|title=Love, art and gardens: the villa "I Tatti" in Fiesole|url=http://www.aboutplants.eu/portal/cms/ENG/content-landscape/251-love-art-and-gardens-the-villa-i-tatti-in-fiesole.html|website=About Plants|accessdate=5 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the words of horticulturist presenter [[Monty Don]], "[Pinsent] has ruthlessly excluded all colour except green".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Don|first1=Monty|title=Monty Don's Italian Gardens|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EfrijhsuuR0|website=YouTube|accessdate=5 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Setting===
I Tatti is set in a mythic landscape. The stony hillsides above it, pockmarked by quarries that supplied the pietra serena for Renaissance Florence, bred masons and sculptors. Nearby Settignano was home to the sculptor [[Desiderio da Settignano]] and to the infant [[Michelangelo]], who was sent there to nurse at his family’s estate (the Villa Michelangelo). A number of houses in the area are given out as the refuge of [[Boccaccio]] during the plague and thus the setting of the [[Decameron]]. Boccaccio’s Arcadian poem, the Ninfale fiesolano, celebrates the Mensola, a stream flowing through the property. The scarred and over-quarried hillsides were reforested with cypresses by Temple Leader in the late nineteenth century, giving them their present sylvan aspect.&lt;ref&gt;Francesca Baldry, ''John Temple Leader e il Castello di Vincigliata: un episodio di restauro e di collezionismo nella Firenze dell’Ottocento'', Florence, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; Anglo-American villa culture flourished in the area at the turn of the twentieth century.

==Operations==
“Villa I Tatti, The Harvard Center for Italian Renaissance Studies” is owned and administered by Harvard University, but it is not the typical American student program abroad. Rather, Harvard conceives of Villa I Tatti as an international institution for the advancement of Italian Renaissance studies on the post-doctoral level. Villa I Tatti is one of three centers for advanced research in the humanities belonging to Harvard but located outside of Cambridge, Massachusetts. The others are [[Dumbarton Oaks]], founded in 1940 for Byzantine, pre-Columbian and garden and landscape studies, and the [[Center for Hellenic Studies]], founded in 1962, both in Washington, D.C.

===I Tatti and Harvard===
While remaining true to the principal outlines of Berenson’s vision, Harvard altered Berenson’s intended structure by admitting other fields than art history. History and literature were present from the beginning of the Center’s existence as a Harvard research institute, and music followed upon the establishment of a library in music history, funded generously by gifts from Elizabeth and Gordon Morrill. It was Harvard’s insistence on a mix of fields that gives I Tatti its distinctive character. Although “interdisciplinary” was not much in use as a term in 1961, the Center was effectively an interdisciplinary institution from the start.

===I Tatti Fellowships===
Each year fifteen full-year fellows are chosen from about 110-120 applicants. All have the doctorate at the time of application but are still in the early phase of their careers. Senior distinguished scholars are not eligible for the fellowship, but every year the director invites some who come without stipend as Visiting Professors in Residence. In a given year perhaps a third of the fellowships tend to be in art history, a third in history, and a third in literature and music. There are no quotas of nation. About half of the fellows over almost 50 years have been from the United States and Canada and half from other countries.

In addition to the fifteen year-long fellowships there are a number of short-term awards aimed at specific groups. A limited number of Mellon Visiting Fellowships, for periods ranging from three to six months, are available each academic year for advanced research in any aspect of the Italian Renaissance. This Fellowship is designed to reach out to Italian Renaissance scholars from areas that have been under-represented at I Tatti, especially those living and working in Asia, Latin America, the Iberian Peninsula and the Mediterranean basin (except Italy and France) and the Islamic countries. There is a similar three-month award, named after I Tatti's third director the [[Craig Hugh Smyth]] Fellowship, for Renaissance scholars whose career paths do not normally allow sabbaticals or afford extended summer vacations, such as museum curators.

===Library and Fototeca===
{{main|The I Tatti Renaissance Library}}
Berenson described I Tatti as a library with a house attached. Library spaces were added to I Tatti in 1909, 1915, 1923 and 1948–54. The shelf space created during Berenson’s lifetime was doubled in 1985 when an additional section, the Paul E. Geier Library, was created in one of the former farm buildings. The wing of the library built by Berenson in 1948–54 was recently renovated by the Roman architectural firm of [http://www.garofalomiura.it/ Garofalo and Miura] and renamed in honor of I Tatti’s third director and his wife, Craig Hugh Smyth and Barbara Linforth Smyth. Opened in October 2009, the new Smyth Library effectively doubled both the wing’s original shelving capacity and the number of workspaces available there.

At his death Berenson left a large personal library of 50,000 volumes, principally dedicated to Mediterranean culture seen through its art and archeology. It also included significant holdings in Chinese, Indian and Near Eastern art, reflecting his collecting interests in those fields. The books were located in a library designed by Cecil Pinsent in 1915, but, also scattered throughout the house. It was not conceived as an interdisciplinary Renaissance library from the beginning but as a reflection of Berenson’s personal interests. Italian literature was not strongly represented and music was absent. During the early decades of the institution’s life it became a priority to flesh out the library’s holdings in areas of Renaissance studies not collected by Berenson himself, and to initiate periodical subscriptions in these fields.

Transformed from a rich but idiosyncratic personal library into a modern research library, the Biblioteca Berenson aims to provide comprehensive research-level coverage of current scholarly publications in all fields of Italian art, architecture, history, science, medicine, society, culture and literature approximately from 1200 to 1650. Research tools are also acquired in adjacent fields such as northern Europe in the same period, medieval studies, and Byzantine and Islamic cultures around the Mediterranean, especially where these relate to Renaissance Italy. It tries to provide modern editions of many of the works of Greek and Latin literature. Currently it holds some 140,000 volumes, which include 106,000 books, 7,000 offprints, 14,000 auction catalogues, and 23,000 periodical volumes. Over 600 periodicals are currently received, most with complete runs from the start of publication.

In 1993 I Tatti joined with three other research libraries in Florence to form a consortium for joint, on-line cataloging, IRIS, which now counts seven member libraries. The Biblioteca Berenson is also one of the 73 libraries that form the Harvard College Library and its holdings are accessible through the Harvard on-line catalogue, HOLLIS. In addition, the considerable electronic resources available through the Harvard library are also available at I Tatti, which makes it one of the largest collections of electronic resources in Italy.

===The Morrill Music Library===
Established by a gift from [[F. Gordon Morrill]] and Elizabeth Morrill, the Morrill Music library has been part of the Biblioteca Berenson since 1966. It covers all western music from the Greeks to the early baroque period, with emphasis on Italian music composed up to 1640. It includes 4,150 scores and 4,300 critical studies, monographs, treatises, and reference works; it subscribes to 84 journal titles. There is also an extensive microfilm collection of musical manuscripts and early printed books. The aim is to acquire every published work in Italian musicology for the period up to 1640.

===The Fototeca Berenson===
The Fototeca Berenson contained 170,000 photographs at Berenson’s death and now contains approximately 250,000 photographs. They are organized topographically, according to Berenson’s original scheme: Florence, Siena, Central Italy, Northern Italy, Lombardy, Venice, Southern Italy, and within each school by artist and location. A section of the Fototeca is devoted to images of “homeless” works of art—the term used by Berenson for objects that were once on the art market but whose presents locations are now unknown. The versos of many photographs contain handwritten notes by Bernard and [[Mary Berenson]], [[Nicky Mariano]] and other art connoisseurs from the first half of the twentieth century. A project to digitize the Fototeca Berenson, making its holdings accessible through the Harvard Libraries’ website, is currently in progress.

Apart from the main collection of photographs on Renaissance painting, there are other minor sections of images representing sculpture, medieval art, [[Byzantine architecture|Byzantine]] and early Christian architecture. Of particular importance are the photos taken by the [[Islamic architecture|Islamic]] architectural historian [[K. A. C. Creswell|Archibald Creswell]] and the collection of some 2,000 vintage prints with views of [[India]] from the photographers Johnston &amp; Hoffmann.&lt;ref&gt;[http://id.lib.harvard.edu/aleph/014217515/catalog The Creswell photographs of Islamic architecture]&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Berenson Archive===
Bernard and Mary Berenson cultivated many friendships through letters. Their letters of their correspondents&lt;ref&gt;''The Berenson Archive: An Inventory of Correspondence compiled by Nicky Mariano on the Centenary of the Birth of Bernard Berenson 1865-1959'', Florence, 1965.&lt;/ref&gt; and some of their own letters are kept in the Berenson Archive, together with diaries, notes, drafts of books, personal photographs and other biographical material. The Archive has been enriched since the founding of the Harvard Center by gifts or acquisitions of papers pertaining to Giorgio Castelfranco, [[Kenneth Clark]], Andrea Francalanci, Frederick Hartt, Giuseppe Marchini, Emilio Marcucci, [[Nicky Mariano]], Roberto and Livia Papini, Valeria Piacentini, Laurance P. and Isabel M. Roberts, Stanislaus Eric Steenbok and the Whitall Pearsall Smith family.

===Collections of Italian painting and Oriental art===
[[File:The Ecstasy of st Francis--Sassetta--Bernson collecton--Settignano.jpg|thumb|Sassetta's ''Ectasy of Saint Francis'', highlight of Berenson's Italian art collection]]
I Tatti is home to the art collection of Bernard and Mary Berenson, which includes an important collection of about 100 late Medieval and Renaissance Italian paintings. The painting collection was formed between ca. 1900 and ca. 1920, with few additions thereafter. Shortly before his death in 1959, Berenson donated his Madonna and Child by Ambrogio Lorenzetti to the Uffizi, which owned two smaller paintings that originally came from the same dismembered altarpiece. The most famous works in the collection, and among the first to be acquired by the Berensons, are three panels depicting St. Francis in Glory, The Blessed Rainieri Rasini, and St. John the Baptist coming from the Sansepolcro Altarpiece by the Sienese painter [[Sassetta]] (painted 1437–1444).&lt;ref&gt;Machtelt Israels, ed., ''Sassetta: The Borgo San Sepolcro Altarpiece'', Cambridge, MA, and Amsterdam, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; A comprehensive modern catalogue of the Berenson Collection of Italian paintings is currently in preparation.

Bernard Berenson also formed a smaller but important collection of Oriental art, including works from China, Japan, Tibet, Thailand, Java, Cambodia and Burma.&lt;ref&gt;Laurance P. Roberts, ''The Bernard Berenson Collection of Oriental Art at Villa I Tatti'', New York, 1991; Michael Rocke, “’Una sorta di sogno d’estasi’: Bernard Berenson, l’oriente e il patrimonio orientale di Villa I Tatti”, in Adriana Boscario and Maurizio Bossi, ed., ''Firenze, Il Giappone e l’Asia orientale'', Florence, 2001, pp. 367–84.&lt;/ref&gt; Berenson also assembled a small but significant collection of Near Eastern manuscripts, including an illuminated page from the renowned fourteenth-century Great Mongol (formerly Demotte) [[Shahnama]].&lt;ref&gt;Richard Ettinghausen, ''Persian Miniatures in the Bernard Berenson Collection'', Milan, 1961; Angelo M.

I Tatti’s scholarly programs provide a special forum for discussion, and have become increasingly crucial to the Center’s mission of creating bridges with its sister institutions and the international scholarly community. There is also an active program of public lectures by outside scholars and shop-talks by fellows. In addition, I Tatti organizes and hosts one or two symposia or giornate di studio each semester which bring scholars from other countries.

Each year I Tatti hosts the Bernard Berenson Lectures, a series of three interconnected lectures on a given theme, presented by a senior scholar of worldwide renown in the field of Renaissance studies. Each cycle of Berenson Lectures is published by Harvard University Press.&lt;ref&gt;Berenson Lectures published to date: Edward Muir, ''The Culture Wars of the Late Renaissance: Skeptics, Libertines, and Opera'', Cambridge, MA and London, 2007; Dale Kent, ''Friendship, Love and Trust in Renaissance Florence'', Cambridge, MA and London, 2009. The lectures of Charles Dempsey on Florentine vernacular culture and those by Julian Gardner on Giotto and his publics will be published in 2010;{{update after|2010|12|31}} those by Caroline Elam on the image of Florence will be published in 2011.{{update after|2011|12|31}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to publication of the acts of various conferences, select monographs, and the annual Berenson Lectures, there is an annual journal for scholarly essays on Renaissance subjects in English and Italian, I Tatti Studies, which was founded in 1985.

Recently a series of monographs on Renaissance history has been initiated with Harvard University Press, the I Tatti Studies in Italian Renaissance History, under the general editorship of [[Edward Muir]].&lt;ref&gt;Titles published to date include: Lodi Nauta, ''In Defense of Common Sense: Lorenzo Valla’s Humanist Critique of Scholastic Philosophy'' (2009); Alison Brown, ''The Return of Lucretius to Renaissance Florence'' (2010); Stephen Bowd, ''Venice’s Most Loyal City: Civic Identity in Renaissance Brescia'' (2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the editorship of [[James Hankins]] of Harvard, Harvard University Press also publishes the [[I Tatti Renaissance Library]], which is modeled on the [[Loeb Classical Library]] and aims to publish the major literary, historical, philosophical and scientific works of the Italian Renaissance written in Latin with modern English translation on facing pages. Forty-one volumes have appeared to date and about 120 more are envisaged in the course of the next decade. The series will put this “lost continent” of Latin literature within the reach of scholars and students in many fields.

Both the fellowship and the scholarly events have been enhanced by the completion late in 2010 of the Deborah Loeb Brice Loggiato, site of fellows' studies and a small auditorium, the Gould Hall, on the designed by Charles Brickbauer.

===Music at Villa I Tatti===
The concerts of early music organized by the Morrill Music Library are an integral part of the academic activities at Villa I Tatti. They range from intimate performances for the I Tatti community, often on period instruments, to those performed by early music groups for a wider audience. The series Early Music at I Tatti, established in 2002 by [[Joseph Connors]] with Kathryn Bosi, offers twice-yearly concerts performed by musicians of international renown. These aim to present to the Florentine community innovative programs of early music centering on a particular theme or idea, such as an examination of the concept of humor in Renaissance music (Early Music at I Tatti, II), the role of music in medieval thought (Early Music at I Tatti, I) or the traditional repertoire deriving from the therapeutic effects of music on the bite of the tarantula spider in southern Italy (Early Music at I Tatti, XII). Many offer repertoires which are rarely heard in Italy today, ranging from works by one of the earliest known Florentine composers, [[Paolo da Firenze]] (fl. 1390–1425) (Early Music at I Tatti, VII), to music written for the Habsburg court at Vienna in the mid seventeenth century by Italian composers favored by the Austrian emperors (Early Music at I Tatti, IX). Contemporary music is sometimes an integral part of the programs: Early Music at I Tatti, IV juxtaposed Petrarch settings by Renaissance composers with settings by the English composer [[Gavin Bryars]], while Early Music at I Tatti, VIII focused on the fruitful relationship which has developed between contemporary composers and performers of early music. Both concerts featured world premieres of new works written for the occasion.
