'''Adolf Kurrein''' (January 28, 1846 &amp;ndash; October 23, 1919) was a [[Czech (people)|Czech]]-[[Austrians|Austrian]] [[rabbi]], [[Zionism|Zionistic activist]].

He received his [[doctor's degree]] from the [[University of Vienna]]. He was rabbi of [[St. Pölten]] (in 1872), of [[Zinz]] (from 1876 to 1882), of [[Bielitz]] (from 1882 to 1888), and in the last-named year was called in the same capacity to Teplitz.

Kurrein is a disciple of [[Adolf Jellinek]]. Besides several collections of sermons, entitled respectively ''"Maggid Mereshit"'' (1880); ''"Maggid le-Adam"'' (1882); ''"Patriarchenbilder: I., Abraham"'' (1893), he is the author of the following pamphlets:
* "Die Frau im Jüdischen Volke" (1885; 2d ed., Bilin, 1901)
* "Traum und Wahrheit", a biography of Joseph (1887)
* "Arbeit und Arbeiter" (1890)
* "Die Sociale Frage im Judentume" (1890)
* "Die Pflichten des Besitzes" (1892)
* "Der Friede" (1892)
* "Das Kaddisch" (1896)
* "Der Grabstein" (1897)
* "Judäa und Rom" (1898)
* "Bibel, Heidentum, und Heidenbekehrung" (1899; 2d. ed., 1901)
* "Brauchen die Juden Christenblut?" (1900)
* "Lichtstrahlen aus den Reden Jellinek's", prepared by him for Jellinek's 70th birthday.

Kurrein edited the monthly ''"Jüdische Chronik"'' from 1894 to 1896 with [[S. Stern]] and [[I. Ziegler]], and from 1897 to 1902 alone. During the last 4 years this periodical has advocated Zionism.

He was a contributor of the [[Jewish Encyclopedia]].

Magazine'': {{Quote|[B]eing a queer artist is more generalized, and being a drag queen is way more specific. I know I kind of let go of the idea of being a drag queen because, for most people, the stereotypical drag queen lip syncs and performs. I've been working on my burlesque and my live music, and I don't really have the drive to dance and flip flop and be doing dips and, 'Is she gonna jump from there?' It's just not something I want to do. It's something that is part of me, but it's not something that I'm carrying into the future, so I’m kind of leaving the term behind.&lt;ref name="notdrag"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.them.us/story/aja-queer-performance |title=Why 'Drag Race' Alum Aja Is No Longer Using the Term 'Drag Queen' |last=Street |first=Mikelle |date=July 3, 2018 |access-date=July 4, 2018 |magazine=them. |publisher=[[Condé Nast]] |archive-date=July 4, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180704002930/https://www.them.us/story/aja-queer-performance |dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''Alecu Beldiman''', common rendition of '''Alexandru Beldiman''' ([[Romanian Cyrillic alphabet|Romanian Cyrillic]]: AлєѯaндрȢ Бєлдимaн), also known as '''Alecul''' or '''Aleco Beldiman''' (1760–ca. January 1826), was a [[Moldavia]]n statesman, translator and poet, one of the forerunners of [[Romanian nationalism]]. A scion of the [[Boyars of Wallachia and Moldavia|boyar elite]], he was the eldest son of ''[[Vornic]]'' Gheorghe Beldiman, and the nephew-in-law of chronicler [[Enache Kogălniceanu]]. Alecu himself held high commission in the [[Moldavian military forces]] and bureaucracy, but secretly resented the [[Phanariote]] regime which had awarded them. He may have affiliated with a loose group known as the "[[National Party (Romania)|National Party]]", championing an alliance between Moldavia's independence from the [[Ottoman Empire]] and support for the [[French First Republic|French Republic]].

Beldiman's earliest contributions to cultural life probably date back to the 1790s, and originally included translations of French prose and [[Verse drama and dramatic verse|verse drama]]. He may have contributed an original play, while his brother, Dumitrache Beldiman, helped arrange some of the earliest Moldavian stage performances, as puppet shows. By 1820, Alecu had become the most productive translator in Moldavia, directly contributing to [[Westernization]] and the spread of [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment ideas]], and also completing a Romanian version of the ''[[Odyssey]]''. His works in the field were circulated in print form by [[Zaharia Carcalechi]], or otherwise copied by hand.

Beldiman's [[anti-Greek sentiment]] peaked during the 1821, when an invasion by the [[Sacred Band (1821)|Sacred Band]] chased him and other Romanian boyars out of Moldavia. The invasion and its violent aftermath inspired him to write the [[epic poem]] ''Tragodiea Moldovei'' ("Moldavia's Tragedy"). Although politically significant and comprising picturesque detail, the work was widely dismissed as a sample of exceptionally bad writing. Upon returning home, Beldiman also came into conflict with [[List of rulers of Moldavia|Prince]] [[Ioan Sturdza]], who had him imprisoned at [[Tazlău Monastery]] in 1824. Poems he wrote during that interval show him as a conservative critic of republican and nationalist propaganda, and display his pity for the lower classes; he was also becoming more supportive of rule by the Ottoman Empire. Though eventually released, he maintained a low profile for the remainder of his life. His family continued to have a role in Moldavian, and later Romanian politics; his grandson [[Alexandru Beldiman]] was a journalist.

==Biography==
===Origins and early life===
According to family tradition, Beldiman's ancestors crossed into Moldavia from the [[Principality of Transylvania (1570–1711)|Principality of Transylvania]].&lt;ref name="lu6alecu"&gt;{{ro icon}} Laurențiu Ungureanu, [https://web.archive.org/web/20180309165937/https://adevarul.ro/cultura/istorie/serial-boieri-mari-episodul-6-alecubeldiman-omul-ne-a-adus-adevarul-1_58a822785ab6550cb8954dbb/index.html "Boieri mari, episodul 6: Alecu Beldiman, omul care ne-a adus ''Adevărul''], in ''[[Adevărul]]'', February 18, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bacalov, p. 25; Iacob, p. 293&lt;/ref&gt; This would make them distant relatives of the Hungarian Counts of Beldi.&lt;ref name="lu6alecu"/&gt; The immigrants entered historical record in March 1579, when "a certain Beldiman" served as Mayor (''[[Schultheiß|Șoltuz]]'') of [[Suceava]].&lt;ref&gt;Stoicescu, p. 349. See also Iacob, p. 293&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1609, [[Nichifor Beldiman]], recorded in some genealogies as a ''nemeș'' (untitled landowner), became ''[[Vornic]]''. He later served as [[Hetman]] and [[Logothete]],&lt;ref&gt;Stoicescu, pp. 349–350&lt;/ref&gt; and, in late 1615, led the boyars into rebellion against Prince [[Ștefan IX Tomșa]]. He was captured in neighboring [[Wallachia]] and beheaded, his remains being disposed of in the [[Siret River]].&lt;ref name="lu6alecu"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stoicescu, pp. 349–350, 353. See also Bacalov, pp. 88–89; Călinescu, p. 55; Iacob, p. 293&lt;/ref&gt; His two sons continued to hold major boyar ranks, while his daughter married into the Prăjescu family.&lt;ref&gt;Stoicescu, pp. 350, 428&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 18th century, the family lost its economic prosperity and political influence, and came to be regarded as emancipated peasants, rather than as boyars. Isolated in the rural areas of [[Fălciu County]], they were often known by the nickname ''Mânja''.&lt;ref&gt;Iacob, pp. 293–295&lt;/ref&gt; Alecu Beldiman's grandfather, Grigore Mânja Beldiman, rectified the situation. From beginnings as a [[Page (servant)|page]] at the court of Prince [[Constantin Cantemir]], he became fluent in [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]] in [[Istanbul]], where he also befriended ''[[Begzada|Beizadea]]'' [[Dimitrie Cantemir]].&lt;ref&gt;Iacob, p. 294&lt;/ref&gt; In 1711, following the [[Pruth River Campaign]], the Cantemirs were chased out of the country; a Beldiman branch also left Moldavia and settled in the [[Russian Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;Bezviconi, p. 177&lt;/ref&gt;

These events led to the emergence of a [[Phanariote]] regime in Moldavia and Wallachia: from ca. 1711, both [[Danubian Principalities]] had lost much of their autonomy within the [[Ottoman Empire]]; the boyar elite, formed mainly by [[Greeks in Romania|Greek immigrants]], controlled the administration. Grigore Mânja survived this time of troubles, and emerged as a favorite of the early Phanariotes: [[Nicholas Mavrocordatos]] and [[Grigore II Ghica]] both made used of his services. However, his participation in boyar conspiracies during the third reign of [[Mihai Racoviță]] endangered his career and his life.&lt;ref name="lu6alecu"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Iacob, pp. 294–295&lt;/ref&gt; Alecu's father was Gheorghe Beldiman (1724–1792). Orphaned of both parents by 1735, he and his four brothers were virtually adopted by the returning Prince Ghica, who groomed them for high office.&lt;ref&gt;Iacob, pp. 295–297&lt;/ref&gt; Gheorghe amassed a personal fortune while climbing through the ranks, serving as ''[[Stolnic]]'' in 1763, ''[[Ban (title)|Ban]]'' in 1773, and finally ''Vornic'' in 1790.&lt;ref&gt;Iacob, pp. 297–298&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Russo-Turkish War (1768–1774)|Russo-Turkish War of the 1770s]], he declared his personal submission to [[Catherine the Great]].&lt;ref&gt;Ion Constantin, Ion Negrei, Gheorghe Negru, ''Ioan Pelivan: istoric al mișcării naționale din Basarabia'', p. 64. Bucharest: Editura Biblioteca Bucureștilor, 2012.  {{ISBN|978-606-8337-39-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; He remained a noted figure in the [[Russophilia|Russophile]] party, and as a result earned a permanent appointment to the [[Sfatul boieresc|Moldavian Divan]] in 1774.&lt;ref name="lu6alecu"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Iacob, p. 298&lt;/ref&gt; 

His son's birth came during the final stages of the Phanariote era. Alecu was born in 1760, either in [[Iași]], the Moldavian capital, or in the smaller town of [[Huși]].&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p. 55; Densusianu, p. 27; Marcu, p. 119&lt;/ref&gt; His maternal family was Greek.&lt;ref name="lu6alecu"/&gt; His mother, Maria, was the daughter of "publican Lefter" from Istanbul; her sister was married to [[Enache Kogălniceanu]], the Moldavian chronicler and social reformer.&lt;ref name="lu6alecu"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Iacob, p. 298. See also Marcu, p. 119&lt;/ref&gt; The couple had an older daughter, Anastasia, and three younger sons: Iancu, Filip, and Dumitrache.&lt;ref&gt;Iacob, pp. 291, 298–300&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Beldiman family coat of arms.svg|thumb|230px|Beldiman coat of arms]]
Early on, Alecu became fluent in Greek and more unusually for his generation, also in French.&lt;ref name="lu6alecu"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p. 55; Eliade, p. 335; Marcu, pp. 121, 123&lt;/ref&gt; He was educated at home and in private Greek schools—unlike Dumitrache, who was a graduate of the [[Princely Academy of Iași|Princely Academy]].&lt;ref name="lu6alecu"/&gt; He climbed steadily through the boyar hierarchy, becoming ''[[Çavuş|Ceauș]]'' in the [[Moldavian military forces]] in 1785; he was ''[[Sardar|Serdar]]'' in 1789. At age 34, Alecu became a ''[[Paharnic]]'' at the princely court of [[Michael Drakos Soutzos]], before being moved to serve as ''[[Ispravnic]]'' in [[Neamț County]]. In 1800, under Prince [[Constantine Ypsilantis]], Beldiman was appointed ''[[Burgrave|Pârcălab]]'' of [[Galați]].&lt;ref name="Marcu, p. 119"&gt;Marcu, p. 119&lt;/ref&gt; Following his father's death, he became sole owner of several estates. One was [[Miroslava, Iași|Cornești]], outside Iași; two others, Iezereni and Tețcureni, were in [[Bessarabia]].&lt;ref&gt;Iacob, pp. 301–304. See also Iorga (1912), p. 110&lt;/ref&gt; Beldiman was married three times. His first wife, name unknown, was a member of the Romano clan; the second was Ileana, sister of the Logothete and poet [[Costache Conachi]], making him in-laws with [[Nicolae Vogoride]], future ''[[Kaymakam]]'' of Moldavia.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, pp. 55, 85, 980. See also Marcu, p. 119&lt;/ref&gt; Beldiman's final, childless, marriage was to Elena Greceanu.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, pp. 55, 980&lt;/ref&gt;

Researcher Nicolae N. Condeescu pushes the beginnings of Beldiman's literary activity into the 18th century, citing him as the uncredited translator of [[Vincent Voiture]]'s novel, ''Alcidales et Zelide''. In or around 1799, he also probably completed a version of [[Eustathios Makrembolites]] and [[Pierre-François Godard de Beauchamps|Godard de Beauchamps]]' ''Story of Hysmine and Hysminias''.&lt;ref&gt;Marcu, pp. 122–123&lt;/ref&gt; In parallel, Beldiman became identified as one of the earliest contributors to the popularization of Western theater. The beginnings of Moldavian own theatrical activity are dated to ca. 1800, when Conachi, [[Nicolae Dimachi]] and Dumitrache Beldiman produced a short series of puppet shows, with Romanian-language texts.&lt;ref name="tvteatru"&gt;Tatiana Vișescu, "Începuturile teatrului românesc cult. Costachi Caragiali – ''O repetiție moldovenească sau noi și iar noi''", in ''Language and Literature – European Landmarks of Identity'', Vol. 1, 2005, p. 129&lt;/ref&gt; They also wrote a comedy of their own, making Dumitrache's one of Moldavia's first playwrights.&lt;ref name="lu6alecu"/&gt; Another play, tentatively dated to 1811, was called ''Serdarul din Orhei'' ("The ''Serdar'' of [[Orhei]]"); historian [[Nicolae Iorga]] believes that it was penned by Alecu Beldiman.&lt;ref name="tvteatru"/&gt;

Dumitrache and Alecu remained interested in both literature and politics; Filip withdrew to a monastery in 1792, while Iancu died later that same decade.&lt;ref name="Iacob, pp. 299–300"&gt;Iacob, pp. 299–300&lt;/ref&gt; According to philologist [[Gheorghe Bogdan-Duică]], Alecu Beldiman's next translation was from [[Homer]]'s ''[[Odyssey]]'' (as ''Odiseia lui Omir''). Andreas Wolf, a [[Transylvanian Saxons|Transylvanian Saxon]] physician, met the Beldimans ca. 1797, praising them as lovers of arts and literature. Bogdan-Duică hypothesizes that Beldiman handed his manuscript to Wolf, who took it to [[Sibiu|Hermannstadt]] and promised to publish it there.&lt;ref&gt;Lascu, pp. 99–101&lt;/ref&gt; It shows the author's familiarity with, and reliance on, the French-style [[Romanization of Greek]], but is above all infused with staples of the [[Moldavian dialect]].&lt;ref&gt;Lascu, pp. 101–104&lt;/ref&gt; Another similar text, tentatively attributed to Beldiman, showed up at [[Dorohoi]], near Moldavia's border with the [[Duchy of Bukovina]].&lt;ref&gt;Lascu, p. 99&lt;/ref&gt;

===Literary fame===
An unclear tradition claims that one of the Belidimans was involved in a project to unite Wallachia and Moldavia as a single "republic", with help from [[Napoleon Bonaparte]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Nicolae Iorga]], "Cugetători români de acum o sută de ani. I. Trei conservatori în epoca de unire și consolidare", in ''Memoriile Secțiunii Istorice'', Vol. XXI, 1939, pp. 706–707&lt;/ref&gt; Following the [[Russo-Turkish War (1806–1812)|Russian invasion of Moldavia in 1806]], the youngest Beldiman brother interrupted his literary activities to serve in the occupation government.&lt;ref name="lu6alecu"/&gt; Alecu's own literary output became more notable following the [[Russo-Turkish War (1806–1812)|Russo-Turkish War]] and the [[Treaty of Bucharest (1812)|peace of Bucharest]]. Both Alecu Beldiman and Conachi had been chased out of their Bessarabian estates by the Russian occupation, which ultimately annexed the region as a [[Bessarabian Governorate]]; they settled in Iași as refugees.&lt;ref&gt;Bezviconi, p. 202&lt;/ref&gt; In 1815, Prince [[Scarlat Callimachi (hospodar)|Scarlat Callimachi]] appointed Alecu an ''[[Agha (title)|Aga]]'' of his citadel in [[Hârlău]].&lt;ref name="Marcu, p. 119"/&gt; At around that time, he also became involved in the thriving business of inn-keeping, establishing his own taproom in [[Bârlad]].&lt;ref&gt;Marcel Proca, "Hanuri. Istoria evoluției de la han la hotel", in ''Academia Bârlădeană'', Vol. XXI, Issue 4 (57), Winter 2014, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; Beldiman was advanced to ''[[Postelnic]]'' in 1818, and finally became the ''Ispravnic'' of Iași in 1819, under Prince [[Michael Soutzos]].&lt;ref&gt;Marcu, p. 119. See also Călinescu, p. 55; Densusianu, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; An 1819 map by Giuseppe Bayardi shows that he owned a mansion on Iași's Sârbească Street.&lt;ref&gt;Iftimi &amp; Văleanu, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; His estate grew to include parts of [[Zorleni|Popeni]] and [[Vinderei]], in [[Tutova County]], as well as several other townhouses in Iași. He also owned several hamlets populated by [[Romani people in Romania|Romanies]], which he kept as [[Slavery in Romania|boyar slaves]].&lt;ref&gt;Iacob, pp. 303–304&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ꙟгрoпaрѣ лȢй Aвєл, 1818.png|thumb|280px|[[Cain and Abel|Abel]]'s burial, as illustrated in the 1818 edition of ''Moartea lui Avel'']]
At this new stage, Beldiman blended [[Romanian nationalism]] with an interest in modern education, declaring himself a direct contributor to the "material progress of the Romanian people".&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p. 55; Eliade, pp. 336, 348&lt;/ref&gt; According to historian [[Neagu Djuvara]], Beldiman closely resembles the Wallachian intellectuals of his era, specifically [[Naum Râmniceanu]], [[Dionisie Eclesiarhul]], and [[Zilot Românul]], in being virulently anti-Greek and anti-Phanariote.&lt;ref&gt;Djuvara, p. 88&lt;/ref&gt; Scholar [[Pompiliu Eliade]] sees the Beldimans and the [[Sturdza family|Sturdzas]] as affiliates of the "[[National Party (Romania)|National Party]]", which favored independence from the Ottomans and sought direct protection from the [[French First Republic|French Republic]].&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, pp. 231–235, 248, 335&lt;/ref&gt; However, Iorga also highlights the limits of Beldiman's nationalism: although he opted to stay in "Turkish Moldavia", he "never wrote as much as a verse, as much as a single line of prose" against Russian occupation in Bessarabia.&lt;ref&gt;Iorga (1912), p. 171&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, scholar [[Ovid Densusianu]] reads Beldiman as a Moldavian particularist, who was generally indifferent to the tribulations of Romanians in Wallachia and elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;Densusianu, pp. 31–32&lt;/ref&gt;

Philologist Andreea Giorgiana Marcu notes that, as a translator of Western literature, Beldiman was necessarily a participant in the [[Age of Enlightenment]]. He resonated most with [[Neoclassicism]], and especially with its "obviously moralizing" accounts.&lt;ref&gt;Marcu, pp. 119, 121, 123&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, culture critic [[George Panu]] proposes that Beldiman and Conachi must have been closely familiarized with, and imitators of, [[Johan Gabriel Oxenstierna]].&lt;ref&gt;Panu, p. 165&lt;/ref&gt; Over 40 years, Beldiman arguably became the most prolific among Moldavia's contributors to Westernizing translations.&lt;ref&gt;Djuvara, pp. 309–310; Marcu, pp. 119, 121&lt;/ref&gt; As noted by Densusianu, Beldiman translated plays that were never intended for actual stage production, since there was no Moldavian theater to speak of.&lt;ref&gt;Densusianu, pp. 28–29&lt;/ref&gt; His texts had to introduce theatrical terminology for which there was yet no equivalent: he proposed ''obraz'' ("cheek" or "face") for "character", and ''schini'' for "scene".&lt;ref&gt;Marcu, p. 122&lt;/ref&gt; However, Eliade proposes that Beldiman was directly inspired to write for the stage by witnessing Moldavia's first first-ever theatrical experiment, produced in December 1816 by [[Gheorghe Asachi]].&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, pp. 347–348&lt;/ref&gt;

By late 1817, Beldiman had completed his own version of [[Voltaire]]'s ''Oreste'', which was only published in 1820.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p. 55; Lascu, pp. 94–95; Eliade, p. 348&lt;/ref&gt; He soon signed contracts with the Wallachian publisher, [[Zaharia Carcalechi]], who was active in the literary circles of [[Kingdom of Hungary (1526–1867)|Habsburg Hungary]].&lt;ref&gt;Densusianu, p. 27; Marcu, p. 119&lt;/ref&gt; In 1818, Beldiman also put out ''Învățătură sau povățuire pentru facerea pâinii'' ("A Guide or Advisor to Bread-making"), ultimately based on a text by Christian Albert Rückert, but directly translated from the Greek version penned by Dimitrios Samurkasis (Dimitrie Samurcaș).&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p. 55; Marcu, p. 121&lt;/ref&gt; Also that year, Beldiman completed a translation of [[Salomon Gessner]]'s ''Der Tod Abels'', from the French intermediary. It was published at [[Buda]] as ''Moartea lui Avel''.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, pp. 55, 980; Densusianu, p. 27; Lascu, p. 94; Marcu, p. 121&lt;/ref&gt;

Beldiman followed up in 1820 with ''Istoria lui Numa Pompilie''. This was a translation of [[Jean-Pierre Claris de Florian]]'s ''Numa Pompilius'', though Beldiman suppressed any mention of the real author.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p. 55. See also Densusianu, p. 27; Eliade, pp. 336, 354–355, 416; Marcu, p. 121&lt;/ref&gt; Its preface includes some of the earliest Romanian views on [[Translation studies|traductology]]: Beldiman complained about his struggles in adapting [[History of the Romanian language|early modern Romanian]] to render complex phrases in French.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, pp. 354–355; Marcu, p. 123&lt;/ref&gt; As noted by linguist [[Gheorghe Ivănescu]], Beldiman followed [[Iacob Stamati]] and other Moldavians in adopting a [[Wallachian dialect|Wallachian spelling]] for some of his core vocabulary. ''Istoria'' consistently used ''giudecată'' ({{IPA-ro|dʒudekatə}}; "trial" or "judgement") for the Moldavianized ''judecată'' ([ʒudekatə]).&lt;ref&gt;[[Gheorghe Ivănescu]], ''Probleme capitale ale vechii române literare'', pp. 62, 122. Iași: [[Alexandru Ioan Cuza University|Editura Universității Alexandru Ioan Cuza]], 2012.  {{ISBN|978-973-703-770-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beldiman completed numerous other translations, without ever submitting them for print. Various scribes copied them by hand, and they enjoyed popularity in boyar circles. However, Beldiman discovered that the texts were being slowly altered in the process, and decided to create his own authorized copies.&lt;ref name="Marcu, p. 121"&gt;Marcu, p. 121&lt;/ref&gt; This process involved several younger scribes. One was Ioniță Sion, who took dictation from Beldiman in writing "all sorts of verse and stories"; he was not paid for the job, but was allowed to make and keep his own copies.&lt;ref name="Lascu, p. 101"&gt;Lascu, p. 101&lt;/ref&gt; By 1813, Matei Gane of [[Vadu Moldovei|Ciumulești]] had already collected and transcribed by hand Beldiman's various works.&lt;ref&gt;[[Constantin Gane]], ''Pe aripa vremei'', p. 72. Bucharest: Tipografia Steaua, 1923&lt;/ref&gt; Beldiman penned, but never printed, other renditions of tragedies and stories by [[Antoine François Prévost]] (with ''[[Manon Lescaut]]''), [[Sophie Ristaud Cottin|Madame Cottin]], [[Pietro Metastasio]], [[René-Charles Guilbert de Pixérécourt]], [[Jean-François Regnard]], [[Louis d'Ussieux]], and various unknown authors.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, pp. 55, 980; Cardaș, p. x; Marcu, pp. 119, 121–122. See also Densusianu, pp. 27–28; Djuvara, pp. 309–310; Eliade, pp. 416–417; Lascu, ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt; Reportedly, he also finished translated the ''[[Iliad]]'', but this work, if it ever existed, remains lost.&lt;ref&gt;Cardaș, p. x; Lascu, pp. 94–95&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Tragodiea Moldovei''===
The final stage of Beldiman's literary and political career was marked by the [[Greek War of Independence]], part of which was fought on Moldavian soil. In early 1821, the country was invaded by [[Alexander Ypsilantis]]' Greek forces, comprising the [[Filiki Eteria]] and the [[Sacred Band (1821)|Sacred Band]]. This occupation forced Beldiman out of Moldavia, and back into Bessarabia.&lt;ref name="Densusianu, p. 27"&gt;Densusianu, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; The events, which culminated in an Ottoman incursion and a Greek defeat in the [[Battle of Dragashani]], were narrated by Beldiman in his rhyming chronicle. It is most often called ''Tragodiea Moldovei'' ("Moldavia's Tragedy"), but is also known as ''Eterie sau jalnicele scene prilejuite în Moldova din resvrătirile grecilor, prin șeful lor Alexandru Ipsilanti venitu din Rusia la anul 1821'' ("The Eteria or Awful Scenes Occurring in Moldavia Because of the Rebellions by Greeks under Their Leader Alexander Ypsilantis, Who Came in from Russia in 1821"). According to literary historian [[George Călinescu]], the work was unintentionally "buffoonish", reading like a "humorous rigmarole".&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, pp. 53–55&lt;/ref&gt; The overall result ran at 4,260 lines of verse which, Călinescu argues, was of an "old-fashioned type" and "monotonous", similar to later works by [[Constantin Negruzzi]].&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, pp. 54, 210&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:AlexanderYpsilantisPruth.jpg|thumb|260px|[[Alexander Ypsilantis]] crossing the [[Prut River]] into Moldavia; allegory by [[Peter von Hess]]]]
Scholar [[Gheorghe Cardaș]] views Beldiman as the final Moldavian representative of a "prolix, untalented" school of poets, which began in 1681 with the anonymous ''Chronological Poem of the Moldavian Rulers''.&lt;ref&gt;Cardaș, pp. ix–x&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Densusianu notes that Beldiman demanded from his readers a patience that he never repaid. He was "not a poet, but only a versifier, and as such one in a string of mediocre writers." Moreover, his genre of choice, the "rhyming chronicle", was "unrewarding" and "manically" over-detailed, though he remained overall superior to Zilot, his Wallachian contemporary.&lt;ref&gt;Densusianu, pp. 29–30&lt;/ref&gt; According to Eliade, ''Tragodiea'' is a "long and tedious newspaper article, prosaic as no prose has ever been, amusing only because the author himself realizes that his work is so very difficult, and his ability so very limited."&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, pp. 335–336&lt;/ref&gt; Eliade also finds that, being no longer disciplined by foreign grammar (as he was in his translations), Beldiman constructs incoherent phrases. His vocabulary is "flooded" with Greek, [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman]], or [[Old Church Slavonic in Romania|Slavonic]] terms.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, p. 355; Marcu, p. 123&lt;/ref&gt;

According to historian [[Vlad Georgescu]], Beldiman was still notable as the most erudite chronicler of his generation.&lt;ref&gt;Georgescu, p. 174&lt;/ref&gt; As Călinescu writes, an "entertaining jolt" in the epic came wherever Beldiman described his contempt for various of his contemporaries: the "godless dog" [[Vasileios Karavias]] and the haughty but "so very cowardly" [[Stefan Bogoridi]].&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; Complex descriptions remain rare, as Beldiman often dismisses the Eterists and his other adversaries with just one epithet, sometimes bordering on the obscene.&lt;ref&gt;Densusianu, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; One line refers to a "Lividi Nicolaki, that base and ugly soul", who, according to Beldiman, had been appointed commander of Moldavia's Romanies by Ypsilantis' government. Researchers are unsure about whether this is a reference to [[Niccolò Livaditti]], a [[Imperial Free City of Trieste|Triestene]] painter.&lt;ref&gt;Sorin Iftimi, Corina Cimpoeșu, Marcelina Brîndușa Munteanu, ''Niccolo Livaditi și epoca sa (1832–1858). Artă și istorie'', p. 21. Iași: [[Palace of Culture (Iași)|Palace of Culture]], 2012.  {{ISBN|978-606-93119-6-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other aspects of the narrative were also polemical, reflecting Beldiman's brand of conservatism. In one episode of his epic, Beldiman sides with the [[Turks in Romania|local Turks]], whom the Eterist invasion had decimated.&lt;ref name="Xenopol, p. 34"&gt;Xenopol, p. 34&lt;/ref&gt; Another one of his stanzas lambasts [[Tudor Vladimirescu]], leader of the [[Wallachian uprising of 1821|parallel uprising in Wallachia]]. As noted by Călinescu, Beldiman and Vladimirescu were both Romanian nationalists, but of different visions; the Moldavian poet described the Wallachian revolutionist as "deceitful", prone to demagoguery.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p. 55; Densusianu, p. 32. See also Georgescu, pp. 185–186&lt;/ref&gt; Historian [[A. D. Xenopol]] also notes that Beldiman was sarcastic in his treatment of the Moldavian republican boyars, whom he called ''[[Decemviri]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Xenopol, p. 78&lt;/ref&gt;

The restoration of Ottoman rule was rendered complete by the [[Battle of Sculeni|Eterist defeat at Sculeni]] in June 1821. Beldiman, having been appointed ''Vornic'',&lt;ref&gt;Georgescu, p. 169&lt;/ref&gt; made the return trip to Iași. In November, he purchased the townhouse owned by a fellow boyar, the Wallachian [[Iordache Filipescu]], in Păcurari neighborhood; it was here that he finished writing ''Tragodiea''.&lt;ref name="Iftimi &amp; Văleanu, p. 26"&gt;Iftimi &amp; Văleanu, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; His poem-chronicle purposefully refrained from documenting the entirety of [[Ioan Sturdza]]'s reign, which began in 1822.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p. 54; Densusianu, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; One stanza circulates the notion that Sturdza was a "son of Moldavia", rather than a Phanariote, and expresses his belief that a "golden century" would follow.&lt;ref&gt;Densusianu, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Vornic'' soon returned to championing his version of boyar nationalism: in ''Tragodiea'', he makes explicit references to the "[[national interest]]".&lt;ref&gt;Georgescu, pp. 169, 182–184, 187, 189–190&lt;/ref&gt; From 1823, Beldiman preserved a copy of what he claimed to be Moldavia's [[Capitulations of the Ottoman Empire|Capitulation]] to the Ottomans, outlining the ancient rights of its inhabitants. The text expanded on earlier forgeries.&lt;ref&gt;Georgescu, p. 186; Giurescu, pp. 4, 13–14, 19–22, 33–34&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, he was more pro-Ottoman than Zilot and other chroniclers, being above all thankful that the Empire had defeated Ypsilantis.&lt;ref&gt;Georgescu, pp. 186–187&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death and legacy===
In reality, Beldiman was at odds with the new regime. As one of the more conservative boyars, he clashed with the monarch. In March 1824, with Dimachi and others, he authored a letter of protest against Prince Sturdza, which was addressed to his overlord, [[List of sultans of the Ottoman Empire|Sultan]] [[Mahmud II]].&lt;ref&gt;Pungă, p. 224&lt;/ref&gt; During the same year, he was briefly imprisoned for his disobedience.&lt;ref&gt;Xenopol, p. 101&lt;/ref&gt; Confined inside [[Tazlău Monastery]], he produced his final set of poems, ''Stihuri'' ("Verse"). These are patriotic in tone, but noticeably skeptical of nationalism, explaining that, even though the Phanariotes had lost power, bad customs survived through native boyars; unusually in his context, he sided with the lower classes against the aristocrats.&lt;ref&gt;Densusianu, pp. 32–33&lt;/ref&gt; Several lines refer to the harsh conditions faced by travelers, noting that rainstorms had rendered infernal his trip to Tazlău.&lt;ref&gt;Ion Ionescu, "Podurile în România", in ''Natura. Revistă pentru Răspândirea Științei'', Issue 4/1936, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; Stylistically, the ''Stihuri'' resemble both Neoclassicism and early [[Romantic poetry]], introducing elements later found in works by [[Barbu Paris Mumuleanu]].&lt;ref name="Marcu, p. 120"&gt;Marcu, p. 120&lt;/ref&gt;

Beldiman was ultimately released and made a discreet return to politics, living in relative seclusion for the rest of his life.&lt;ref name="Densusianu, p. 27"/&gt; His last published translation came out in 1824. It was a first volume of [[William Coxe (historian)|William Coxe]]'s ''Travels into Poland, Russia, Sweden and Denmark'', taken from a French version by [[Paul Henri Mallet]].&lt;ref name="Marcu, p. 121"/&gt; He died in January 1826, or at, earliest, December 1825&lt;ref name="Iacob, p. 299"&gt;Iacob, p. 299&lt;/ref&gt;—according to fellow writer Dimitrie Pastiescul, he still held a pen in his hand when this occurred.&lt;ref name="Marcu, p. 119"/&gt; Buried at his family's favorite church of [[Talpalari Church|Talpalari]],&lt;ref name="lu6alecu"/&gt; Beldiman left a large number of manuscripts, which were reportedly sold by the pound to a local collector.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; Both Dumitrache and Filip survived their brother's death, the former dying in 1831.&lt;ref name="Iacob, pp. 299–300"/&gt; Filip, better known under his monastic name "Filaret", was appointed [[Archdiocese of Roman and Bacău|Bishop of Roman]] and carateker of the [[Metropolis of Moldavia and Bukovina|Moldavian Metropolis]].&lt;ref name="lu6alecu"/&gt; In 1842, he served as administrator of Moldavia, filling in for Prince [[Mihail Sturdza]].&lt;ref&gt;Pungă, p. 246&lt;/ref&gt;

From his Romano marriage, Alecu had a daughter. Known as either Pulheria or Profira, she married into the [[Cantacuzino family]].&lt;ref name="lu6alecu"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, pp. 55, 980; Djuvara, p. 355; Iacob, p. 299&lt;/ref&gt; She was famous for raising her husband's illegitimate son, the half-Romani Dincă, who was formally her house slave. Her refusal to manumit him, and his subsequent suicide, resulted in mass support for abolitionism.&lt;ref name="lu6alecu"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Djuvara, pp. 276–278&lt;/ref&gt; Alecu's son, Vasile Beldiman, married a [[Mavrocordatos family|Mavrocordatos]].&lt;ref name="ndi306"&gt;Narcis Dorin Ion, "Istorie și genealogie. Convorbiri cu domnul Mihai Dim. Sturdza", in ''Cercetări Istorice'', Vol. XXXIV, 2015, p. 306&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p. 980; Iacob, p. 299&lt;/ref&gt; His only notable public office was that of Caretaker (''Epitrop'') of Moldavian schools.&lt;ref name="lu6alecu"/&gt; His wife Elena sold the Beldiman house in Păcurari to boyar [[Lupu Balș]]; it changed hands and served various functions until being demolished in 1966.&lt;ref name="Iftimi &amp; Văleanu, p. 26"/&gt;

Vasile died in 1853,&lt;ref name="ndi306"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Iacob, p. 299"/&gt; and was survived by a son, [[Alexandru Beldiman]], who was the head of [[Romanian Police]] and close friend of the Principalities' first ''[[Domnitor]]'', [[Alexandru Ioan Cuza]]. In this capacity, he failed to prevent Cuza's toppling in 1866, and came to oppose the regime of [[Carol I of Romania|Carol I]], founding the left-wing newspaper ''[[Adevărul]]''.&lt;ref name="lu6alecu"/&gt; Cornești, still owned by this branch of the family, was passed to poet [[Dimitrie Anghel]], and later to the Mavrocordatos.&lt;ref name="lu6alecu"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Iacob, p. 303&lt;/ref&gt;

A Iordachi Beldiman, sometimes described as Alecu's son,&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p. 162&lt;/ref&gt; was in fact one of his nephews, born to Dumitrache Beldiman.&lt;ref name="lu6alecu"/&gt; Iordachi married Catinca Dimachi, daughter of the writer. She was made famous by her affair with poet [[Alexandru Hrisoverghi]]; according to one account, Hrisoverghi died after jumping out a window in Iordachi's townhouse.&lt;ref name="lu6alecu"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, pp. 93, 162–163&lt;/ref&gt; Also a ''Vornic'', Iordachi was noted for commissioning a gallery of portraits of Moldavian Princes.&lt;ref&gt;Sorin Iftimi, "Chipurile domnitorului Alexandru Moruzi în portrete din secolul XIX", in ''Cercetări Istorice'', Vol. XXXIV, 2015, p. 179&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[United Principalities]] era, he became a leading figure in Iași's conservative circles, helping [[Iacob Negruzzi]] establish the political review ''Constituțiunea''.&lt;ref name="lu6alecu"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Iorga (1934), p. 62&lt;/ref&gt; Alecu's niece, Maria or Marghioala, was a locally famous philanthropist,&lt;ref name="lu6alecu"/&gt; married to politician [[Scarlat Miclescu]]. Their son, Dimitrie S. Miclescu (1820–1896), participated in the [[Moldavian revolution of 1848|1848 revolutionary movement]], as well as being a published poet. He became a noted agitator on the far-left of [[Liberalism and radicalism in Romania|Romanian liberalism]] and renounced all claim to boyar privilege, including his family name.&lt;ref&gt;"Dumitru Scarlat Miclescu", in ''[[Gazeta Transilvaniei]]'', Issue 270/1896, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

Beldiman's translations continued to be read by young intellectuals in all Romanian-speaking areas: [[Constantin N. Brăiloiu]], who went abroad to study in 1828, ordered copies of ''Oreste'' and ''Istoria lui Numa Pompilie'', "so as not to forget his language".&lt;ref&gt;Laurențiu Vlad, "Câteva date despre educația unui tânăr boier valah. Studiile lui Constantin N. Brăiloiu la Sibiu, Geneva și Paris în anii 1822–1832", in ''Țara Bârsei'', Issue 8, 2009, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; Ioniță Sion's manuscripts were preserved by his son, the poet-memoirist [[Gheorghe Sion]].&lt;ref name="Lascu, p. 101"/&gt; For decades, ''Tragodiea'' circulated in 23 handwritten copies, two of which were respectively owned by [[Nicolae Bălcescu]] and [[Alexandru Odobescu]].&lt;ref name="Marcu, p. 120"/&gt; In the 1840s, [[Mihail Kogălniceanu]] set himself the task of printing Beldiman's writings and documents as part of an anthology.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p. 177; Giurescu, pp. 4, 13, 19–20&lt;/ref&gt; As ''Eterie sau jalnicele scene'', ''Tragodiea'' was eventually printed in 1861, at the expense of an Alecu Balica; it was reissued in 1875 as ''Tragedia Moldovei''.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p. 980. See also Densusianu, p. 29; Marcu, p. 120&lt;/ref&gt;

By then, poet [[Vasile Alecsandri]] was actively campaigning for Beldiman to be included into the Romanian literary canon,&lt;ref&gt;Iorga (1934), pp. 179–180&lt;/ref&gt; while philologist [[Alexandru Lambrior]] unsuccessfully proposed to set the Romanian literary standard exclusively on words used by Beldiman and Conachi.&lt;ref&gt;Panu, pp. 171–173&lt;/ref&gt; Beldiman's work was finally rediscovered in the 1890s. One of its promoters was the antiquarian [[George Ionescu-Gion]], who insisted that Beldiman was without philosophical merit, but a genuine patriot.&lt;ref&gt;Rodica Florea, "Reviste și scriitori în ultimele două decenii ale secolului al XIX-lea", in [[Șerban Cioculescu]], [[Ovidiu Papadima]], [[Alexandru Piru]] (eds.), ''Istoria literaturii române. III: Epoca marilor clasici'', p. 945. Bucharest: [[Editura Academiei]], 1973&lt;/ref&gt; The same belief was expressed in 1910 by Xenopol, according to whom Beldiman was not significant as a poet, but voiced the "national sentiment in all its freedom".&lt;ref name="Xenopol, p. 34"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3964">[[File:Angela Cannings.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Angela Cannings outside the [[Palace of Westminster]].]]
'''Angela Cannings''' was wrongfully convicted and sentenced to [[life imprisonment]] in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] in 2002 for the murder of her seven-week-old son, Jason, who died in 1991, and of her 18-week-old son Matthew, who died in 1999.  Her first child, Gemma, died of [[Sudden Infant Death Syndrome]] (SIDS) in 1989 at the age of 13 weeks, although she was never charged in connection with Gemma's death.

Her conviction was based on claims that she had smothered the children, but was overturned as unsafe by the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]] on 10 December 2003.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/wiltshire/3306271.stm "Mother cleared of killing sons"], BBC News, December 10, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Cannings was convicted after the involvement in her case of Professor Sir [[Roy Meadow]], a paediatrician who was later struck off, then reinstated, by the General Medical Council.&lt;ref&gt;Doward, Jamie. [http://observer.guardian.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,6903,1391441,00.html "Parents demand gag on cot death doctor's lectures"]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070223053743/http://observer.guardian.co.uk/uk_news/story/0%2C6903%2C1391441%2C00.html |date=February 23, 2007 }}, ''The Observer'', January 16, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cannings case was re-examined after a [[BBC]] "Real Story" investigation showed that her paternal great-grandmother had suffered one sudden infant death and her paternal grandmother two. Professor Michael Patton, a clinical geneticist at St George's Hospital Medical School, told the BBC that a genetic inheritance was the most likely explanation for the crib deaths in the family.&lt;ref name=BBCNov2&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/real_story/3234297.stm "Doubts case over baby deaths case"], BBC News, November 2, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Involvement of Roy Meadow==
Expert witness Professor Sir [[Roy Meadow]] was later struck off the [[General Medical Council]] register partly as a result of his evidence at the Cannings trial. Meadow based his calculations on the likelihood of a second [[cot death]] being the same as the likelihood of a first, whereas in households where one crib death has taken place, the [[probability]] of another is greatly increased. He also asserted cot death implausible (which was contrary to the opinion of other specialists). Cannings later said Meadow should be "severely punished" for his testimony in her case and others.  Meadow was later reinstated to the GMC on appeal, a judge ruling that his errors did not amount to serious professional misconduct.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1510798/Sir-Roy-Meadow-the-flawed-witness-wins-GMC-appeal.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other cases==
The quashing of Cannings' conviction and other high-profile cases resulted in a review of 297 other cases where conviction relied on expert witness opinion. On 14 February 2006, [[Lord Goldsmith]], the [[Attorney General for England and Wales|Attorney General]], announced that three of these cases needed to be reconsidered by the courts, but that the majority did not give rise to concern.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15305">'''Bautista van Schouwen Vasey''' (San Lorenzo de Tarapacá, [[Chile]], 3 April 1943 - [[Santiago de Chile]], 13 December 1973) was a medical doctor and one of the founders of the [[Revolutionary Left Movement (Chile)|Movement of the Revolutionary Left]] (MIR), the Chilean guerrilla organization which earliest resisted the Military Coup of Augusto Pinochet in 1973. Five among the "Ten most wanted" opposition figures wanted by the military government after the 11 September coup were militants of MIR. Bautista van Schouwen was at the time member of MIR's "Comisión Política" and the "Secretariado", the highest executive organ of the MIR. The military had set a reward of 500 000 Escudos to anyone who would lead them to the capture of Van Schouwen.&lt;ref&gt;Diario "El Mercurio", Santiago, Chile, 28 Septembre 1973&lt;/ref&gt; He was abducted in Santiago December 13, 1973, in the church ''Parroquia Capuchinos'' (2345 Catedral Street), after having been caught when the priest who was sheltering them, unwittingly let slip to his military cousins, that they were at the church. Father Enrique White was also detained and tortured, later exiled to England.&lt;ref&gt;Nancy Guzmán Jasme, "Un grito desde el silencio: detención, asesinato y desaparición de Bautista van Schouwen y Patricio Munita". [[LOM Ediciones]], Santiago, 1998, page 153-&lt;/ref&gt; Van Schouwen and his lieutenant Patricio Munita had previously obtained clandestine refuge in the Capuchinos church-premises. They were soon after their capture killed under torture in the Army-managed detention and torture centre of [[Villa Grimaldi]]. The assassinations of Van Schouwen and Munita were however concealed by the Pinochet government and the Van Schouwen case during several years labelled as ''[[Forced disappearance#Argentina|desaparecido]]'' (the "missing ones") by Human-rights organizations in Chile (see below Demise whereabouts).

== Biography ==
Bautista van Schouwen Vasey was the first son of Industrial Chemical Engineer Bautista van Schouwen Figueroa and Carlota María Valentina Vasey Crozier. He had two younger brothers named Carlos and Jorge.  The family arrived in the Concepción region in 1953 and established first in a rural property in the nearby La Florida and then in Concepción. During the second half of his high-school studies he met [[Miguel Enríquez (politician)|Miguel Enriquez]] and [[Marcello Ferrada de Noli]]. These friends,&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Minster (2009) ''Chile's MIR: The Revolutionary Left Movement. Urban Guerrillas Declare War on the Pinochet Dictatorship''. About.com: Latin American History [http://latinamericanhistory.about.com/od/thehistoryofchile/a/09ChileMIR.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; together with an elder brother of Miguel Enríquez (Marco Antonio) and a new comrade they met at the first year of medical studies at the [[University of Concepcion]] (Jorge Gutiérrez Correa) started the secret group Movimiento Socialista Revolucionario in 1962. Other two members joined 1963-1964. The group first entered the socialist cell "Sierra Maestra" (also called "Espartaco", of the Socialist Party Youth in Concepción) led by Marcello Ferrada de Noli &lt;ref&gt;Pedro Naranjo, "La vida de Miguel Enríquez y el MIR". En: Naranjo P., Ahumada M., Garcés M y Pinto J. ''Miguel Enríquez y el proyecto revolucionario en Chile''. Ed. Lom, 2004. Page 37&lt;/ref&gt; and who have according to their plans established earlier a "pie de terre" in the Socialist Party 1961. In fact, the group was from the beginning a fraction within the Socialist Party in Concepción. Historians have referred that this political group developed around their publication "Revolution" which first issue appeared in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;Julio Cesar Jobet. "Historia del Partido Socialista de Chile". Cuadernos de Orientación Socialista. Santiago de Chile, 2003. Primera edición digital 2003 [http://www.salvador-allende.cl/Biblioteca/ps_jobet.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

Bautista van Schouwen Vasey married in the summer of 1968 to Inés Enríquez Espinosa, an English literature graduate and the only sister of Miguel Enríquez Espinosa, the best man of their wedding was their other old-time friend Marcello Ferrada de Noli. Bautista van Schouwen Vasey and Inés Enríquez Espinosa had one child named Pablo.

In October 1965 Bautista van Schouwen Vasey participated in the foundation of the MIR in Santiago and was elected at that opportunity member of MIR's Central Committee.&lt;ref&gt;Pedro Alfonso Valdés Navarro (2008) "Elementos teóricos en la formación y desarrollo del MIR durante el periodo 1965-1970". Universidad de Valparaíso, Chile. Tesis de grado. Pages 1-121 [http://www.archivochile.com/tesis/04_tp/04tp0016.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; Two years after was elected chairman of MIR's Regional Committee for Concepción, the largest in the MIR, nationwide. In 1966 he was President of the Medical Student Union of the University of Concepción and led with Nelson Gutierrez (President of the Sociology Students Union), Marcello Ferrada de Noli (President of the Philosophy Students Union) and Luis Moreno (President of the Engineer Students Union) a long, and at times bloody, struggle for a university reform at the conservative University of Concepción. Together with medical student Luciano Cruz (another notorious MIR leader, died 1971) and other students of prominent participation in such struggle&amp;nbsp;– mainly from the ''Movimiento Universitario de Izquierda, MUI'' - they finally succeeded in 1968 obtaining a university reform which became model for the student movement in the country elsewhere. Years 1968-1969 the student-movement in Chile had scored notable victories but at the same time increased a confrontation with the authorities both at the universities and government. It was at that time when Bautista Van Schouwen Vasey and Miguel Enríquez Espinosa published the document ''De las luchas estudiantiles a las filas de la Revolución'' ("From the students' struggles to the ranks of the Revolution").

In 1969 the Christian Democratic government of [[Eduardo Frei Montalva|Eduardo Frei]] declared MIR out-law and many MIR cadres had to pass to clandestine life. The government implemented a nationwide persecution of the thirteen most known leaders of the organization at that epoch (among those wanted were Miguel Enríquez, Luciano Cruz, Bautista Van Schouwen, Nelson Gutierrez, Marcello Ferrada de Noli, Anibal Matamala, Jose Bordas, José Goñi, Juan Saavedra Gorriategy, and others).&lt;ref&gt;Diario "El Mercurio", Santiago de Chile, "A Través de la Historia Terrorista del Movimiento de Izquierda Revolucionaria (MIR)", 25 August 1973&lt;/ref&gt;  Bautista Van Schouwen was however never captured. The cause against the MIR was eventually dismissed the year after by the new government of Salvador Allende through an amnesty decree. By then Bautista Van Schouwen had moved to Santiago and had taken the political leadership and the editor-in-chief post of ''El Rebelde'', MIR's official newspaper.

Bautista van Schouwen Vasey graduated in 1968 from medical school with the second best marks of his promotion and he took afterwards an internship and postdoctoral training in neurology. He left those activities shortly thereafter for full-time dedication to the political and military activities of MIR, in preparation to resist the imminent [[1973 Chilean coup d'état]] against the [[Salvador Allende]] government which finally took place on the 11th of September, 1973. Some time before in 1972 Bautista Van Schouwen Vasey was married for the second time to Astrid Heitmman, a registered nurse at the university hospital.

== Ideological stands ==
The ideological stands among the early generation of youngsters from Concepción that founded MIR in 1965 correspond to a variety of political ideologies ranging from Social-liberalism to Marxist and Trotskyite positions. Although official declarations of the epoch, MIR had not a truly uniform ideological stand until the Congress of 1967 (see [[Revolutionary Left Movement (Chile)|Movement of the Revolutionary Left]]) in which prevailed the Leninists positions represented by the new elected General Secretary Miguel Enriquez. Bautista Van Schouwen did follow his friend Miguel Enríquez in this regard. However, it has been put forward that van Schouwen would have been a closer follower to the doctrine of [[Rosa Luxemburg]], favouring general strikes over cadre-organization political work as in Leninists traditions.&lt;ref&gt;Pedro Alfonso Valdés Navarro (2008) "Elementos teóricos en la formación y desarrollo del MIR durante el periodo 1965-1970". Universidad de Valparaíso, Chile. Tesis de grado. Pages 1-121 [http://www.archivochile.com/tesis/04_tp/04tp0016.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; Other authors of the epoch have placed Van Schouwen's earlier ideological positions in the line of socialist humanism and also sympathetic with social-anarchist positions. Contrary to what "official" versions have maintained,&lt;ref&gt;i.e. Naranjo Sandoval, Pedro; "La vida de Miguel Enríquez y el MIR", in Naranjo Sandoval, Pedro (ed); Miguel Enríquez y el Proyecto Revolucionario en Chile. Ed. LOM. Santiago, 2004. p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; historians have established&amp;nbsp;– based in interview testimonies of Marco Antonio Enríquez, a History Professor at [[Sorbonne]] ( also referred above as elder brother of Miguel Enríquez) - that Bautista Van Schouwen did not participate in the elaboration of the first historical document in the foundation of MIR, The "Insurrectional Thesis".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archivochile.com/tesis/04_tp/04tp0016.pdf Pedro Alfonso Valdés Navarro (2008), cited work above, page  121]&lt;/ref&gt; Bautista Van Schouwen was nevertheless a prolific writer of political documents and he was trusted by his peers the political and ideological leadership of MIR's official newspaper "El Rebelde". The last known MIR-document in which Bautista Van Schouwen had personally participated was the situation-analysis of December 1973 authored by the ''Secretariado'' of MIR (the MIR executive committee, led by [[Miguel Enríquez (politician)|Miguel Enríquez]]).

== Demise whereabouts ==
Bautista Van Schouwen was killed under captivity by DINA late at night December 13, 1973 with a bullet on the head; later abandoned under a tree, at a cross-road in the proximities of [[Villa Grimaldi]], and again his body perforated from the back with multiple bullets from machine-gun fire. Another military patrol discovered later the corpses of Munita and Van Schouwen (with no identifications) and&amp;nbsp;– unaware of the above facts&amp;nbsp;– took them routinely to the Forensic station in Santiago. There was an autopsy performed, and the victim's identities were also established, which was routinely reported thereafter to the police. When this report reached DINA their operatives confiscated the corpses and ordered a secret burial, at night, in [[Patio 29]] at the "Cementerio General" of Santiago. On the 16 February 1974, again in a secret operation&amp;nbsp;– this time presumably under the direct orders of Augusto Pinochet to General Ernesto Baeza, the Interior Minister &lt;ref&gt;Nancy Guzmán Jasme, "Un grito desde el silencio: detención, asesinato y desaparición de Bautista van Schouwen y Patricio Munita". Lom Ediciones, Santiago, 1998. Page 133 -&lt;/ref&gt;- DINA arranged the exhumation and incineration of Bautista Van Schouwen's remains. The secret killing of Bautista Van Schouwen had  remarkable consequences.

The MIR let it be known for many years that Van Schouwen was instead alive, under captivity by the military, but heavily wounded due to torture. MIR even published a picture of Van Schouwen depicting him with bandages supposedly imprisoned in a military medical compound. On the other hand, the military have given contradictory information to the public; first the interior ministry informed, and echoed by the press  &lt;ref&gt;Diario "El Mercurio", Santiago, Chile, 17 August 1974&lt;/ref&gt; (17 August 1974) that Bautista Van Schouwen had been captured on December 13, 1973, and that he was "in custody at an undisclosed location".&lt;ref&gt;Mark Ensalaco, "Chile under Pinochet. Recovering the truth". University of Pennsylvania Pres, Philadelphia, 2000. Page 72 [https://books.google.com/books?id=hzrwMb3UppYC&amp;pg=PA72&amp;lpg=PA72&amp;dq=bautista+van+schowen&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=-72BwaxLr9&amp;sig=rJnVH1au9HfEip3RbOR6rYmTuEU&amp;hl=sv&amp;ei=3IQATqm0DsaCOqTuzaIO&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=15&amp;ved=0CHYQ6AEwDg#v=onepage&amp;q=MIR&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year the military retracted the information on that Van Schouwen was in custody in Chile and affirmed instead that he had "escaped to Cuba on the 2nd of February" 1974.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=hzrwMb3UppYC&amp;pg=PA72&amp;lpg=PA72&amp;dq=bautista+van+schowen&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=-72BwaxLr9&amp;sig=rJnVH1au9HfEip3RbOR6rYmTuEU&amp;hl=sv&amp;ei=3IQATqm0DsaCOqTuzaIO&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=15&amp;ved=0CHYQ6AEwDg#v=onepage&amp;q=MIR&amp;f=false Mark Ensalaco, quoted work. Page 72]&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, [[Amnesty International]] informed in their first report about the human-rights violations by the Chilean Junta that Van Schouwen was held prisoner and had been transported to a variety of detention sites by the military. The Chilean human-rights organizations, for their part, for years went on demanding clarity on the "disappearance" of Bautista Van Schouwen and his case was included in a variety of judicial processes that ensued around the missing ones in Chile (those whose whereabouts were unknown). As late as 1998 his friend and MIR co-founder Marcello Ferrada de Noli, then a university professor in Norway, filled in European courts a criminal case against Augusto Pinochet &lt;ref&gt;[http://ferradanoli.files.wordpress.com/2009/12/ferrada-noli-bring-pinochet-to-justice2.pdf Svenska Dagbladet, Stockholm, 06-11-1998. Brännpunkt, page 10]&lt;/ref&gt; for the assassination or disappearance of Bautista Van Schouwen and Edgardo Enriquez.&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press, November 1, 1998. "Chilean in Norway files against Pinochet". OSLO, Norway, November 1 (AP)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dagbladet.no/nyheter/1998/11/01/137778.html NTB/Dagblad, "Pinochet politianmeldt i Norge", Oslo, 1 Nov 1998]&lt;/ref&gt; Pinochet was then under house arrest in London but was ultimately granted by the British government returning to Chile without processes in Europe.

In 2007 an Appeal Court in Santiago de Chile processed the former DINA commander, Army General (R) [[Marcelo Moren Brito]], for the criminal killing of Bautista Van Schouwen and his lieutenant Patricio Munita.&lt;ref&gt;Diario "La Nación", Santiago, Chile, 25 July 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 Bautista's son Pablo began legal proceedings against the Chilean state in a civil action. The court hearing with full witness testimonies began on January 31, 2017 in Santiago.

A console port published by Rooster Teeth Games was released on November 20, 2018, exclusively through GameStop.

The game follows Henry Stein, a retired animator who returns to his old studio after an invitation from his old employer and discovers a nightmare of cartoon characters seemingly brought to life by the titular Ink Machine.

''Bendy and the Ink Machine'' was well received upon its initial release, with praise centering on its vintage aesthetic and story. In the months following its release, it quickly gained a cult following from exposure on platforms like [[YouTube]] and [[Twitch.tv|Twitch]], and eventually was approved through Steam Greenlight in mid-2017. Merchandise, as well as a mobile spinoff, was later introduced to further promote the game. Mike Mood, the game's programmer and co-creator, described the game as an "accidental success".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/TylerMcAuleyVallier/20170711/301391/The_CoCreater_of_Bendy_and_the_Ink_Machine_Talks_Accidental_Success.php|title=The Co-Creator of Bendy and the Ink Machine Talks Accidental Success|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gameplay ==
''Bendy and the Ink Machine'' is a survival horror game that uses a mixture of puzzle solving, environment exploration and combat to aid Henry on his journey through Joey Drew Studios. Players explore through a first-person view and have limited physical actions such as running and jumping. Different items can be collected, some of which are required to perform various tasks before proceeding. Cans of [[bacon soup]], a reference to the game's creator theMeatly and his partner Mike Mood, can also be collected for both achievements and to restore Henry's [[Health (gaming)|health]] if he is injured.

Combat is primarily focused around a variety of different melee-based weapons, such as an axe or a pipe. In-game enemies all have different strength levels and resilience to damage, forcing players to be tactical about keeping out of reach and striking when necessary. Henry can retreat inside Little Miracle Stations whenever enemies are nearby in order to recover or remain out of sight. If he takes too much damage, he can escape from the ink that consumes him and [[respawn]] at one of the numerous statues of Bendy that act as [[checkpoint (video gaming)|checkpoints]].

In addition, players can find numerous audio logs throughout the studio that give more details about the game's story, particularly concerning about the fate of the studio and its employees, similar to the systems used in games such as ''[[BioShock]]''. Some of these logs can be missed and require further exploration to uncover the secret areas they often reside in. 

==Plot==
{{plot|date=October 2018}}
Henry Stein returns to his old animation studio, ''Joey Drew Studios'', after receiving an invitation from his old employer Joey Drew to be shown something important, finding the titular Ink Machine. During the attempt to repair and turn it on, he uncovers old tape recordings that imply that Joey was taking part in bizarre occult practices while making the Machine. After completing the steps to fix it, Henry is suddenly attacked by an monster who resembles the studio's mascot Bendy. Henry tries to escape as the workshop floods with ink. When he reaches the EXIT door the floor beneath him collapses, sending him into the depths below, flooded with ink. After draining the Ink and finding an axe, he then passes out in a room with a pentagram. Henry wakes up, then he  explores the studio for a way out, encountering hostile ink monsters. He learns that Sammy Lawrence, the musical director for the studio, started to worship Bendy as a deity after the Machine's installation. After draining a stairwell to escape, Henry is knocked out from behind by the now-insane Sammy. Hoping that his "Lord" will restore his humanity, Sammy plots to sacrifice Henry to Bendy as an offering, but the ritual fails when Sammy is attacked and apparently killed by Bendy. Henry flees and encounters a living version of Boris the Wolf, and the pair escape to a safe house. 

Deciding to try to find a way out, the pair enter the studio's toy department where they encounter another ink creature who resembles the character Alice Angel, implied to be made from the character's actress, Susie Campbell. Henry follows Alice down to her lair where she explains she has been harvesting the body parts of other ink monsters to improve her deformed appearance, offering him his freedom in exchange for a few 'favours'. During these tasks, Henry frequently encounters "Bendy" wandering the halls, corrupted versions of the Butcher Gang characters, and another creature called the Projectionist, implied to be created from the studio's projectionist Norman Polk. When every task is complete, Henry and Boris are allowed to ascend in an elevator to escape, but Alice proclaims she wants to use Boris to fix herself and makes it crash. As Boris tries to wake Henry, he is suddenly pulled away by Alice into the darkness. Henry climbs out of the remains of the crashed elevator to search for Boris, passing through the studio's archives and discovering a gathering of more ink creatures named the Lost Ones, implied to be some of the studio's former employees desperate to go home. Henry eventually finds himself in a large underground warehouse that houses prototypes for a Bendy theme park, "Bendy Land", created by park designer Bertrum Piedmont. He begins restoring power to the warehouse to access the haunted house where Boris is being kept, encountering a monstrous version of Bertrum encased within an amusement attraction in the process. He also crosses paths with the Projectionist again but Bendy appears and kills the creature, appearing to save him. Eventually getting inside the haunted house, Henry discovers Boris is now a hulking monster thanks to Alice, and is forced to kill him. An enraged Alice tries to kill Henry herself, only to be run through by a sword from behind belonging to a second Alice Angel and another clone of Boris with a mechanical arm. 

Allison and Tom, the Alice and Boris clones, lock Henry in their hideout, unsure of what he is. After some time in captivity, Henry gains their trust enough to be given the Seeing Tool, a looking glass that can reveals hidden messages left behind by someone else trying to escape the studio. After Bendy discovers the hideout, Henry escapes and uses a paddle-boat to cross a river of ink, finding a town made by the ink creatures. Sammy, having survived his encounter with Bendy, attacks Henry in a rage but is killed by Tom. After fighting off Sammy's followers with Allison and Tom, Henry is separated from them after falling into the studio's administration offices. With more hidden messages telling him to get something inside the studio's Film Vault, Henry discovers more audio logs that tell the truth about the studio's downfall. It it revealed that Joey ordered the Machine's construction after the studio began to run into financial difficulty with the declining sales of the Bendy cartoons, creating it from equal parts of  engineering and magic. The hope was to run the studio's cartoon film reels through the Machine in order to create real-life cartoon attractions that people could interact with. The first attempt at doing this resulted in "Bendy", rejected as an abomination because of his lack of a soul, after which Joey decided to use the souls of his employees to create better attractions, resulting in the ink creatures and the studio's bankruptcy.

Henry opens up the Vault after reuniting with Allison and Tom, where another hidden message reveals that "Bendy" has taken something from it. Henry decides to venture into "Bendy's" lair, the Ink Machine itself, to recover the item, where he finds a tape left behind by Joey. The studio owner explains the only thing that can truly defeat "Bendy" is "The End", a reel of film and the object stolen by the creature, who suddenly appears and transforms into an enormous ink beast to stop Henry from playing it. Evading the demon's attacks, Henry is able to insert "The End" into a projector where "Beast Bendy" is forced to watch it and disintegrates. The game then suddenly switches from the studio to the inside of a home (implied to be a flashback that takes place before the game itself), covered in letters and sketches related to characters and events from earlier in the game. Henry goes to the kitchen, where he finds an elderly Joey waiting to talk to him. As the old studio owner talks of how they took two different paths to get to this point, Joey tells Henry that he should visit the old workshop as he has something to show him. When Henry opens the door, he finds himself entering the studio at the beginning of the game, repeating his opening lines.

In a post-credits scene, the camera focuses on an image of Bendy, Boris, and Alice by Henry who gifted it to Joey for the success of the characters. With the sight of a rusted Ink Machine in the corner, a young girl's voice asks "Uncle Joey" to tell her another story. This implies that the entire game is actually a story that Joey is telling to his niece.

== Characters ==
The playable character and protagonist is '''Henry Stein''' (theMeatly), a former [[animator]] of Joey Drew Studios, who returns to the studio thirty years after resigning from the company. The game is played through a [[first-person narrative]].

'''Joey Drew''' (David Eddings), the CEO of the studio, invites Henry back to the studio. He introduced the Ink Machine to the studio, exhibiting peculiar behavior around it. Joey is described as a "man of ideas, but nothing else" by Henry. Other characters view him as an unethical employer and demanding perfectionist, uncaring towards the working conditions of his colleagues. Though acting like an eccentric dreamer, Chapter 4 proves this is just a ruse via a recording, Joey is actually portrayed as a cynical, greedy individual only concerned with his own success by drawing people in with his false promise of fulfilling their dreams. TheMeatly described Joey's greatest and worst flaw as his "unending desire to make the impossible possible."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/themeatly/status/881494750020460544|title=theMeatly on Twitter|date=2 July 2017|work=[[Twitter]]|language=English|accessdate=8 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other members of the studio's staff are introduced via audio recordings. These include '''Wally Franks''' (theMeatly), the studio [[janitor]]; '''Thomas Connor''' (Mike Mood), a [[repairman]] who built the Ink Machine; '''Sammy Lawrence''' (Aaron Landon), the musical director, who serves as an antagonist in Chapter 2, worshipping Bendy as a deity and returning in Chapter 5; '''Jack Fain''' (Bookpast), a [[lyricist]], turned into a "swollen" Searcher in the remastered Chapter 2; projector operator '''Norman Polk''' (theMeatly), transformed into a monster called the "Projectionist", appearing in Chapters 3 and 4,&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.player.one/bendy-and-ink-machine-chapter-3-review-120462|title=Bendy And The Ink Machine Chapter 3 Review: Alice Is Here|last=Asarch|first=Steven|date=30 September 2017|publisher=Player.One|language=English|accessdate=8 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; a character that was almost left out of the final version of the third chapter due to time restraints;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.player.one/how-bendy-ink-machine-lived-hype-120559|title=How Bendy And The Ink Machine Lived Up To The Hype|last=Asarch|first=Steven|date=14 July 2017|publisher=Player.One|language=English|accessdate=8 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; accountant '''Grant Cohen''' (Will Ryan); '''Shawn Flynn''' ([[Jacksepticeye|Seán McLoughlin]]), an Irish toy designer; '''Bertrum Piedmont''' (Joe J. Thomas), a theme park [[architect]], who appears as a boss in Chapter 4;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsweek.com/bendy-ink-machine-chapter-4-906038|title='Bendy and the Ink Machine' Chapter 4 Almost Destroyed Its Creators|last=Asarch|first=Steven|date=30 April 2018|work=[[Newsweek]]|publisher=Player.One|language=English|accessdate=8 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; engineer '''Lacie Benton''' ([[Lani Minella]]); and the voice actresses of the character Alice Angel, '''Susie Campbell''' (Alanna Linayre), and her replacement '''Allison Pendle''' (Lauren Synger).

Susie plays a major antagonistic role in Chapters 3 and 4, appearing as a malevolent, deformed version of the character '''Alice Angel'''. Through audio recordings, Susie is revealed to have been unceremoniously replaced with Allison as Alice's voice actress, causing her to blame Joey for deceiving her.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Susie kills numerous cartoon characters and harvests their innards to become a "perfect" incarnation of herself, and specifically targets '''Boris the Wolf'''. Allison appears in Chapter 4 and 5 as a heroic version of Alice, referred to as "Allison Angel".

Throughout the game, Henry encounters numerous staff members, transformed into monsters made from ink, or resembling the studio's animated characters. A number of these appear in Chapter 4, referred to as the "Lost Ones", but show no hostility towards the player, though turn antagonistic in Chapter 5 after Sammy's death. The stock enemy in the game are the "Searchers", though other variants appear in boss battles.

The studio has created several in-universe cartoon characters who starred in silent animated shorts. The titular character is '''Bendy the Dancing Demon''', the studio mascot, who appears as a recurring antagonist towards Henry throughout the game. Bendy's name was in fact a typo, created when the 3D modeling program, Blender, saved the character's model with the name. The fifth chapter revealed the antagonistic Bendy was a soulless, experimental creation of the Ink Machine to create real cartoon characters, and is the only incarnation of Bendy born from the machine.

Boris appears as several individual characters in the game. In Chapter 2, the player meets a benevolent version of Boris, who accompanies Henry throughout Chapter 3. Several other copies of Boris are found dead in the first and third chapters, used by Susie to achieve her "perfection".

'''Boverianda Nanjamma and Chinnappa''' are translators and scholars of Kodava studies. Their ''[[Pattole Palame]]'' was written using the Kannada script originally. It has been translated into English by Boverianda Nanjamma and Chinnappa and has been published by Rupa &amp; Co., New Delhi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Books: Pattole Palame ~ A love song to Kodagu |url=http://mulledink.blogspot.in/2012/05/books-pattole-palame-love-song-to.html |publisher=Google blogger - Aditi De |accessdate=1 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Boverianda Nanjamma and Chinnappa are the grandchildren of [[Nadikerianda Chinnappa]], the compiler of the [[Pattole Palame]]. The translators’ introduction explains: "Since the [[Kodava language|Kodava]] language does not have a script, he used the Kannada script that has been in vogue since the 17th century, when the Lingayat Rajas ruled Kodagu and Kannada was their court language." Nadikerianda Chinnappa had begun translating the work into English in 1925 but he died in 1931, before he could complete it.

Chinnappa's daughter Gangamma married Muthanna who was an engineer and from the Boverianda clan. Chinnappa's son and daughter-in-law were both teachers. Their daughter Nanjamma was married to her cross-cousin,  the son of Gangamma (Chinnappa's daughter), who had also been named Chinnappa. Boverianda Chinnappa, an engineer with a degree from an Illinois university, and Nanjamma, a statistician who did her early schooling in Udupi and Mangalore, obtained her master's degree in statistics from Madras University in 1954 and did her post-graduate studies in the Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata. They both pursued their professions at Chennai, Kolkata and Canada. Nanjamma was a visiting fellow at Cambridge University in 1974. She has also co-authored a book on Business Survey Methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Business Survey Methods|url=https://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&amp;field-author=B.%20Nanjamma%20Chinnappa&amp;page=1&amp;rh=n%3A283155%2Cp_27%3AB.%20Nanjamma%20Chinnappa|work=Amazon.com|publisher=Amazon|accessdate=30 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1993 she was elected as a [[Fellow of the American Statistical Association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.amstat.org/awards/fellowslist.cfm |title=View/Search Fellows of the ASA |work=American Statistical Association |accessdate=18 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2006 she was given an honorary doctorate degree (D. Litt.) of the Mangalore University by T. N. Chaturvedi, the Governor of Karnataka.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mallya|first=Dr. K B|title=Nanjamma Chinnappa: A Statistician Par Excellence|url=http://www.mangalorean.com/news.php?newstype=local&amp;newsid=25658|work=Mangalorean.com|publisher=Mangalore Media Company|accessdate=30 December 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304030445/http://www.mangalorean.com/news.php?newstype=local&amp;newsid=25658|archivedate=4 March 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pattole Palame in English ==

In the 1970s, Boverianda Chinnappa, Nanjamma's mother and Nanjamma began to copy out the ''Pattole Palome'' in longhand over almost three years.&lt;ref name="It's story time, folks"&gt;{{cite news |title=It's story time, folks |url=http://www.hindu.com/mp/2003/10/16/stories/2003101600630300.htm |newspaper=The Hindu |date=16 October 2003 |accessdate=1 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; While they were searching for copies of the original edition of the [[Pattole Palome|Pattole Palame]], a ninety-year-old farmer and self-taught folk artist, Bacharaniyanda Annaiah, responded to their advertisement. During his youth, unable to afford the book, he had copied out the entire text word by word under a kerosene lamp. This hardcover book he gifted to the Chinnappas. Nanjamma's parents assisted in translating and interpreting the text. In the second edition of ''Pattole Palame'' (or 'Silken Lore'), published by the University of Mysore in 1975, the editor describes it as one of the earliest extensive collections of folklore from any Indian community.&lt;ref name="It's story time, folks"/&gt;

After retirement the couple settled down in Bangalore in 1995 and began to realise their grandfather's cherished dream. Finally in 2003, they completed the work and it has been published by Rupa &amp; Co., New Delhi. That same year it was released in Madikeri (Mercara). This book has become the chief text for the Coorgs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://indianfolklore.org/journals/index.php/IFRJ/article/download/182/189 |title=Pattole Palame: Kodava Culture – Folksongs and Traditions |first=M.

==Other works==
Boverianda Nanjamma and Chinnappa have chalked out at least ten [[Kodagu]]-based projects for the future, including a directory of aine mane or ancestral homes, a lexicon of the Kodava language and a biography of the late Bacharaniyanda Annaiah, a self-taught folk artist. Presently they have been working on the ainemane project, this can be found on the '''Ainmanes''' website.&lt;ref name=Ainmanes&gt;{{cite web |title=Ainmanes |url=http://ainmanes.com/ |publisher=Chinshai technologies |accessdate=1 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ainmanes Project==

===Ainmanes.com (website)===

Boverianda Nanjamma and Chinnappa had undertaken a project to collect information regarding each and every Ainmane found in Kodagu, irrespective of the community or caste of the clan members residing in them. They visited many of them in the period between April 2003 and May 2008. They also collected oral legends and traditional information from the occupants of each of these functional Ainemanes. The information was collected from members of the okka present in the ainmané during the visits and from those contacted later by telephone. Along with this they have researched about the concerned clans from previously published written material, wherever possible.  The stories collected from the informants are oral narratives. The information thus collected are now available on the [[Ainmanes]] website. They have also provided a glossary for the Kodava thakk words used in the site. The couple are currently working on a book "Ainmanés of Koḍagu" that will give an overview of the ancestral homes of Koḍagu and of their socio-cultural significance.&lt;ref name="Ainmanes"/&gt;

The objective of this web-site is to document the current status of the traditional ainmanés of all the communities in Koḍagu and thereby contribute to the archival records of the heritage and oral history of the people of Koḍagu. It provides insights into the social and religious customs and conventions of the communities in Kodagu and the way of life of the people. It will also serve to raise awareness of the value of these buildings and the need to preserve them, besides providing information for those studying the socio-cultural-architectural heritage of Kodagu. This web-site contains information on all the traditional ainmanés in Koḍagu that were functional when the Chinnappas visited them. It includes photographs and information on each ainmané and its okka.&lt;ref name="Ainmanes"/&gt;
 
Every ainmané in the web-site is identified by its mané péda, the village where it is located and the community to which it belongs. Entering the mané péda of the okka in the ‘Search window’ allows the user to retrieve the photos  and information on the ainmané and the okka. A table listing the okkas visited in alphabetical order of their mané pédas along with the names of the villages where their ainmanés are located and the communities that the okkas belong to is provided. Similar tables in alphabetical order of village names and by community are also provided. Also included are sketch maps of Kodagu (in 9 sections) that show the location of each ainmané. The ainmanés are identified by numbers on the maps, and the index gives their mané pédas. A glossary gives the meanings of words in Koḍava language that are in the web-site. Accent marks in the glossary and the key to the transliteration provides a guide to the reader on the correct pronunciation of these words.&lt;ref name="Ainmanes"/&gt;

=== Ainmanes of Kodagu (book)===

In 2014, Niyogi books has published their work titled ''Ainmanes of Kodagu''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Bopanna |first=P. T. |title=Kodagu Ainmanes Book Hits The Stands |url=http://www.coorgtourisminfo.com/coorg_news.php |website=Coorg Tourism Info |publisher=Bopanna |accessdate=25 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gautreaux won his last election to the Senate in 2007, when he defeated the Republican Clayton D. Diaz, 25,348 (71 percent) to 10,372 (29 percent). At that time the district also included two precincts in [[St. Martin Parish, Louisiana|St. Martin Parish]], since removed from the reconfiguration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://staticresults.sos.la.gov/10202007/10202007_Legislative.html|title=Louisiana primary election returns, October 20, 2007|publisher=staticresults.scs.la.gov|accessdate=October 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1996 to 2000, Gautreaux was a member of the [[Louisiana House of Representatives]] from District 51 but vacated the post after the single term to run for the Senate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ballotpedia.org/wiki/index.php/Butch_Gautreaux Gautreaux on Ballotpedia] (accessed 2010 October 8).&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1995 general election, Gautreaux defeated the Democrat-turned-Republican [[Joe Harrison (Louisiana politician)|Joe Harrison]], 8,457 votes (69 percent) to 3,809 ballots (31 percent).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://staticresults.sos.la.gov/11181995/11181995_Legislative.html|title=Louisiana general election returns, November 18, 1995|publisher=staticresults.sos.la.gov|accessdate=October 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harrison was subsequently elected in 2007 to House District 51 and still holds the seat.

== Background ==
Gautreaux attended [[Nicholls State University]] in [[Thibodaux, Louisiana|Thibodaux]], Louisiana. He served from 1967 to 1972 in the [[United States Navy]]. He is active in [[Rotary International]], having been secretary of the Morgan City chapter.

== Race for lieutenant governor ==
Gautreaux sought the [[lieutenant governor]]ship of Louisiana in a 2010 [[by-election|special election]] occasioned by the resignation of incumbent [[Mitch Landrieu]] when Landrieu became [[mayor of New Orleans]]. In a field of eight candidates Gautreaux, who had the official endorsement of the Louisiana [[AFL-CIO]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Beginning as a lithographer, he developed as an expert in [[handwriting]] and became sought after as an [[expert witness]] in a variety of famous [[trial (law)|trial]]s including the [[Roupell case]] and the [[Tichborne Case]].&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt;

In 1871, Chabot became involved in establishing the ''[[identity of Junius]]'' and concluded that he was Sir [[Philip Francis (English politician)|Philip Francis]].&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chabot (1871)&lt;/ref&gt;

Chabot married Sarah ''née'' Nichols in 1842 and the couple parented at least one son, Charles. Chabot died at home in London.&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt; and was buried at the [[West Norwood Cemetery|South Metropolitan Cemetery at West Norwood]]

'''Dismas Nsengiyaremye''' (born 1945) served as [[Prime Minister of Rwanda|Prime Minister]] of [[Rwanda]] from 2 April 1992 to 18 July 1993.

A native of [[Gitarama]], he was a member of the [[Republican Democratic Movement]] and was appointed prime minister following an agreement between President [[Juvénal Habyarimana]] and the political opposition. During his term, he appointed [[Agathe Uwilingiyimana]] to the Ministry of Education, though she later succeeded him as prime minister.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hill |first=Kevin A. |chapter=Agathe Uwilingiyimana |editor1-first=Rebecca Mae |editor1-last=Salokar |editor2-first=Mary L. |editor2-last=Volcansek |title=Women and the Law: A Bio-Bibliographical Sourcebook |location=Westport, CT |publisher=[[Greenwood Press]] |pages=323–8 |year=1996 |edition=ill. |isbn=978-0-313-29410-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When it was revealed in February 1993 that the [[Rwandan Defence Forces|army]] was compiling lists of alleged "accomplices" of the [[Rwandan Patriotic Front]], Nsengiyaremye protested against what he called a "witch hunt".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Des Forges|first1=Alison|authorlink=Alison Des Forges|title=Leave None to Tell the Story: Genocide in Rwanda – Choosing War → He Who Wishes for Peace Prepares for War |date=March 1999|publisher=[[Human Rights Watch]]|location=New York|isbn=1-56432-171-1|url=https://www.hrw.org/legacy/reports/1999/rwanda/Geno1-3-11.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nsengiyaremye fled to Europe not long after he was replaced as prime minister in 1993, citing threats to his life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Des Forges|first1=Alison|authorlink=Alison Des Forges|title=Leave None to Tell the Story: Genocide in Rwanda – Choosing War → Splitting the Opposition |date=March 1999|publisher=[[Human Rights Watch]]|location=New York|isbn=1-56432-171-1|url=https://www.hrw.org/legacy/reports/1999/rwanda/Geno1-3-11.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; He currently lives in exile in Belgium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Twagilimana |first=Aimable |date=6 November 2015 |title=Historical Dictionary of Rwanda |url=https://books.google.com.my/books?id=9E6xCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA172&amp;lpg=PA172&amp;dq=dismas+nsengiyaremye+dictionary&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=UxYRVC-fEK&amp;sig=iz86rPpo_9VsSCERjSPO1DOprgM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=dismas%20nsengiyaremye%20dictionary&amp;f=false |location= |publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield |page=172 |isbn=9781442255913 |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Diviš Bořek z Miletínka''' ({{lang-de|Diwisch Borek von Miletin}}) (died 8 January 1438) was a captain of the [[Hussite]]s in eastern and central [[Bohemia]].

He started his career as a poor, rural nobleman of [[Czechs|Czech]] origin, seated at small stronghold named Miletínek, near the village [[Miletín]] in northeastern Bohemia. After [[Jan Hus]] had been burned at the stake in [[Constance]] (1415), he joined the Hussite movement. At first, he was a leader of the more radical Hussites and a comrade of [[Jan Žižka]]; later he became more moderate and even fought against the [[Taborites]].

In 1420, Diviš and priest [[Ambrož Hradecký]] conquered [[Hradec Králové]], the most important city in eastern Bohemia. It allowed him in following year to conquer and loot nearby [[Benedictine]] monastery at [[Opatovice nad Labem]] and subsequently the very same fate prepared for the [[Cistercian]] [[Sezemice Convent]]. He confiscated their properties which made him suddenly a rich man. In 1423, he founded a small castle on the hill [[Kunětická Hora]] (82 m above ground), near the town [[Pardubice]]; this castle he named [[Kunětice Mountain Castle]].

In June and July 1423 he and captain Bedřich of Strážnice led a campaign to [[Moravia]], in which they defeated the armies of [[Jan XII. Železný]] ("the Iron"), [[Bishop of Olomouc]] and the Duke [[Přemek I, Duke of Opava|Přemek of Opava]]. After its return to Bohemia, the Hussite armies were attacked near Hradec Králové by the armies of Jan Žižka, whom they had regarded as fellow Hussites. Jan Žižka defeated them and took the abundant prey they had conquered in Moravia.

In subsequent years, he led campaigns of conquest to eastern Bohemia and became a captain in the towns Pardubice and [[Litomyšl]]. In 1427 he supported as a captain of [[Kolín]] the moderate [[Utraquists]] and hosted the delegation, who at this meeting decided the attack Prague. This plan was betrayed and the army was massacred. In return, [[Prokop the Great]] led his army to Kolín and besieged it. Diviš could keep up the defense of the city for three months, until town's paupers, which sympathized with the radical Hussites, forced him to surrender. Diviš agreed with the besiegers on the surrender of the town in return for free passage.

In later years he was one of the leaders of the moderate Hussites and stood in the forefront of the combined armies of the Utraquists and the Catholics loyal to King [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund]] of Luxembourg. This coalition defeated in the decisive [[Battle of Lipany]] (30 May 1434) joined armies of the [[Sirotci]] (Orphans) and [[Taborites]] which meant the definitive end of the [[Hussite Wars]].

His participation in the Hussite Wars brought him a large fortune. As a reward for his loyal service, he was finally [[enfeoffed]] with the lands of Kunětická Hora and other areas. In 1436 he also bought Pardubice, one year later obtained from the king town [[Přelouč]] with surrounding villages as a [[Pledge (law)|pawn]]. He died as one of the richest man in eastern Bohemia. His inheritance was divided among his sons; unfortunately, they lost those possessions just as quickly.

'''Dubricius''' or '''Dubric''' ({{lang-cy|Dyfrig}}; [[Norman-French]]:&amp;nbsp;''Devereux''; c. 465 &amp;ndash; c. 550) was a 6th-century [[Britons (historical)|British]] ecclesiastic venerated as a [[saint]]. He was the evangelist of [[Ergyng]] ({{lang-cy|Erging}}) (later [[Archenfield]])  and much of [[South Wales|southeast Wales]].

==Biography==
The earliest documentation of Dubricius is from around 1133, recording the translation of his relics, and is to be found (in the form of "Lectiones") in the ''[[Book of Llandaff]]'' (''Liber Landavensis''). It may contain some genuine traditions, but as it appeared at least five hundred years after his death, it cannot claim to be historical.&lt;ref name=Toke/&gt;

Dubricius was the illegitimate son of Efrddyl, the daughter of King [[Peibio Clafrog]] of Ergyng. His grandfather threw his mother into the [[River Wye]] when he discovered she was pregnant, but was unsuccessful in drowning her. Dubricius was born in [[Madley]] in [[Herefordshire]], [[England]]. He and his mother were reconciled with Peibio when the child Dubricius touched him and cured him of his [[leprosy]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/livesofbritishsa02bariuoft#page/362/mode/2up Baring-Gould, Sabine and Fisher, John, ''The Lives of the British Saints: The Saints of Wales and Cornwall and such Irish Saints as have dedications in Britain'', Vol.2, p.363, Charles J. Clark, London, 1908]&lt;/ref&gt;

Noted for his precocious intellect, by the time he attained manhood he was already known as a scholar throughout Britain.&lt;ref name=Toke/&gt; Dubricius founded a monastery at [[Hentland]] and then one at [[Moccas]].&lt;ref name=butler&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/210/11/142.html Butler, Rev. Alban, ''The Lives of the Saints'', Volume XI, 1866]&lt;/ref&gt; He became the teacher of many well-known [[Wales|Welsh]] saints, including [[Teilo]] and [[Samson of Dol|Samson]] and also healed the sick of various disorders through the laying on of hands.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Jenkins Rees|Rees, W. J.]] ed., [http://www.maryjones.us/ctexts/dubricius.html  ''The Liber Landavensis''], The Welsh MSS. Society. Llandovery, W. Rees, 1840&lt;/ref&gt; Dedications at [[Porlock]] and near [[Luscombe]] on the [[Exmoor]] coast of [[Somerset]] may indicate that he also travelled in that area. He later became [[Bishop of Llandaff|Bishop of Ergyng]],&lt;ref name=butler/&gt; possibly with his seat at [[Weston under Penyard]], and probably held sway over all of [[Glamorgan]] and [[Kingdom of Gwent|Gwent]], an area that was later known as the [[diocese of Llandaff]]. However, he may have merely been a bishop for the purpose of ordaining priests, not as administrative head of the church over a geographical area. Dubricius was good friends with Saints [[Illtud]] and [[Samson of Dol|Samson]], and attended the [[Synod of Brefi|Synod of Llanddewi Brefi]] in 545, where he is said to have resigned his see in favour of [[Saint David]]. He retired to [[Bardsey Island]] where he was eventually buried before his body was transferred to [[Llandaff Cathedral]] in 1120.

According to legend, Dubricius was made Archbishop of [[Llandaff]] by [[Saint Germanus of Auxerre]], and later crowned [[King Arthur]]. He appears as a character in [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]]'s ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]'' and [[Wace]]'s ''[[Roman de Brut]]'', which was based on it. Much later [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson]] featured the saint in his ''[[Idylls of the King]]''.

==Liturgical cult==
Churches dedicated to Saint Dubricius include the [[Church of England]] churches at [[Ballingham]], [[Whitchurch, Herefordshire|Whitchurch]], [[Hentland]] and Hamnish, all in [[Herefordshire]], [[Porlock]] in [[Somerset]], and the [[Church in Wales]] churches at [[Erwood|Gwenddwr]] in [[Breconshire]] (probably not an old dedication) and  at [[Llanvaches]] in [[Newport, Wales|Newport]]. The Catholic Church at [[Treforest]] is also dedicated to Dyfrig.

In the 2004 edition of the [[Roman Martyrology]], Dyfrig is listed under 14 November with the Latin name ''Dubricius''. He is stated to have died on Bardsey Island, 'on the north coast of Wales, as a bishop and abbot'.&lt;ref&gt;''Martyrologium Romanum'', 2004, Vatican Press (Typis Vaticanis), p. 622.&lt;/ref&gt; In the current [[Roman Catholic]] liturgical calendar for Wales&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.liturgyoffice.org.uk/Calendar/National/Wales1.shtml National Calendar for Wales] Accessed 2012-02-06.&lt;/ref&gt; he is commemorated on the traditional date of 14 November.

===Iconography===
He is usually represented holding two crosiers to signify his jurisdiction over the sees of Caerleon and Llandaff.&lt;ref name=Toke&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05179a.htm Toke, Leslie. "St. Dubric." The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 5. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1909. 14 April 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Fat Cat and Friends''''' is an [[Australia]]n children's television show starring Fat Cat (full name: '''Frederick Alphonso Tubsy Cat''' or '''Francis Aloysius Tom Cat'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.adelaide.edu.au/uni-archives/files/2011/06/AUSA-3.jpg University of Adelaide archives], Response by channel 10 station manager Trever Lanyon to a query by the Adelaide University Science Association.&lt;/ref&gt;), a costumed character, who is an orange/ginger [[anthropomorphic]] cat who wears red [[Braces (clothing)|braces]], a blue [[bow tie]] and a green [[bowler hat]] and striped socks. The show is similar in concept to ''[[Here's Humphrey]]'' featuring [[Humphrey B. Bear]]. The program would feature resident music artist [[Patsy Biscoe]], who would go on to record numerous kids album, as well as main hostess Lynn Weston, who would later host children's show ''[[The Book Place]]''. The show was cancelled in 1991,&lt;ref name=cancellation&gt;[http://austv.hostforweb.com/cgi-bin/cgi2/index.rb?page=Fat%20Cat%20and%20Friends%20^401977-92^41&amp;section=Television%20History%20Reference/TV%20Shows/F&amp;mode=0 Fat Cat and Friends (1977–92)] – Australian Television Archive&lt;/ref&gt; however the Fat Cat character continues to feature on television in [[Perth]] as the [[mascot]] of the [[Channel Seven Perth Telethon|Telethon]] fundraising organization.&lt;ref name=Telethon&gt;[http://telethon7perth.com.au/Fat_Cat_shows.aspx Fat Cat &amp; Friends + Appearances], ''This loveable children's character has been alive and living in Perth since 1968. Many mums and dads have set their watches by him every night when he gets kids off to bed at 6.30pm on Channel 7.'', Telethon 7&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
Following the cancellation of ''[[The Magic Circle Club]]'', actor/writer Max Bartlett continued to work in television production, moving to [[Western Australia]], where he helped to develop the character of "Fat Cat" and the children's series, ''The Underground Video Show''. The character still says goodnight to Perth children on television at 7.30 each night.&lt;ref&gt;[http://telethon7perth.com.au/Fat_Cat_shows.aspx Fat Cat &amp; Friends + Appearances], Telethon 7&lt;/ref&gt;

"Fat Cat and Friends" was then produced in the studios of [[Network 10]] Adelaide and it survived the 1987 frequency switch of channels 10 &amp; 7 in Adelaide. It was written, directed and produced by Murray George for 13 years. It was then produced by Channel 10. The show ran on the 0-10 Network (as it was then known) from 1972 until 1987, then on the [[Seven Network]] until it was cancelled in 1991 after the [[Australian Broadcasting Tribunal]] claimed that the program was not educational enough and was "not clearly defined and encouraging of bestial adoration".&lt;ref name=cancellation/&gt; There was also a question of gender—namely, that Fat Cat did not appear to have one. The character being mute was also a clear issue despite the precedent of [[Humphrey B. Bear]].

During the 1990s, Fat Cat often appeared on celebrity versions of the then Adelaide produced ''[[Wheel of Fortune (Australian game show)|Wheel of Fortune]]''. As Fat Cat did not speak he was usually paired up with Channel 7's resident puppet [[Agro (puppet)|Agro]] who was the mouthpiece for the duo.

Despite cancellation, Fat Cat still appears on [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]] television screens as the [[mascot]] of Seven Perth's highly successful [[Channel Seven Perth Telethon|Telethon]] fundraising organisation.&lt;ref name=Telethon/&gt;

Fat Cat was originally played by Reg Whiteman for more than a decade.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perthnow.com.au/news/fat-cat-reg-whiteman-rests-in-peace/story-e6frg12c-1226104852948 'Fat Cat' Reg Whiteman rests in peace], From: PerthNow, 30 July 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Fat Cat was then played by Ralf Hadzic for five years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/entertainment/fat-cat-had-key-to-big-night-out/story-e6fredpu-1226252787113 ''It would appear the password was a pointed reference to the chauffeur who recently reported champion cyclist Stuart O'Grady, to police over an alleged assault. The man, Ralf Hadzic, played children's character Fat Cat for five years.''], Fat Cat had key to big night out, 25 January 2012, adelaidenow&lt;/ref&gt;  Fat Cat was then played by Melanie George (1980–1985) who is now a freelance choreographer. Robert Fordham played Fat Cat from 1994 and performed on 3 of the Fat Cat Storytime videos. The character was later played off screen by a male friend ''Damien'' of the show's musician, singer [[Patsy Biscoe]].

Initially slated for release as a sidekick to Fat Cat, the character of 'Stringbean' was originally played in the first month of screening by veteran comedic actor 'Nudge McGee'.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

'''Gríma''', called (the) '''Wormtongue''', is a fictional character in [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''. He appears in the second and third volumes of the work, ''[[The Two Towers]]'' and ''[[The Return of the King]]'', and his role is expanded in ''[[Unfinished Tales]]''. He is introduced in ''The Two Towers'' as the chief advisor to King [[Théoden]] of [[Rohan (Middle-earth)|Rohan]] and henchman of [[Saruman]].  Gríma serves as an [[archetype|archetypal]] [[sycophant]], flatterer, liar, and manipulator, and is considered to be based by Tolkien on the [[Beowulf]] character [[Unferth]].&lt;ref&gt;J. Allard, ''Beowulf and Other Stories'' (2014) p. 45-7&lt;/ref&gt;

The name ''[[wikt:grima#Old English|Gríma]]'' derives from the [[Old English language|Old English]] or [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] word meaning "mask", "helmet" or "spectre".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.halfdan.is/vestur/nofn.htm#grím {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090201213253/http://www.halfdan.is/vestur/nofn.htm |date=1 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bosworth.ff.cuni.cz/017508|title=gríma|work=[[An Anglo-Saxon Dictionary]] (Online) | author=Bosworth, Joseph | authorlink=Joseph Bosworth |author2=Toller, T. Northcote | location=Prague | publisher=[[Charles University]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also possible to link the name to the English word "grim", which among other characteristics means "ugly"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bosworth.ff.cuni.cz/009520|title=EORL|work=[[An Anglo-Saxon Dictionary]] (Online) | author=Bosworth, Joseph | authorlink=Joseph Bosworth |author2=Toller, T. Northcote | location=Prague | publisher=[[Charles University]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Old English language|Old English]].

== Appearances ==

=== ''The Two Towers'' ===

Gríma, son of Gálmód, was at first a faithful servant, but he eventually fell in league with [[Saruman]], and from then on worked to weaken Théoden and his kingdom through lies and persuasion.

Tolkien describes him as "a wizened figure of a man, with a pale wise face, and heavy lidded eyes", with a "long pale tongue".

He was widely disliked in [[Edoras]]; everyone except [[Théoden]] called him "Wormtongue". The original meaning of "worm" in Old English was "A serpent, snake, dragon," and [[Gandalf]] repeatedly compares him to a snake:{{quote|text=The wise speak only of what they know, Gríma son of Gálmód. A witless worm have you become. Therefore be silent, and keep your forked tongue behind your teeth. I have not passed through fire and death to bandy crooked words with a serving-man till the lightning falls.|sign=Gandalf|source=''The Two Towers''}}

{{quote|text=See, Théoden, here is a snake! To slay it would be just. But it was not always as it now is. Once it was a man, and it did you service in its fashion.|sign=Gandalf|source=''The Two Towers''}}
   
It is implied that Saruman had promised him [[Éowyn]], the king's niece, as a reward for his services. Her brother [[Éomer]] accused him of "watching her under his lids and haunting her steps". His schemes were foiled when Gandalf the White and his companions arrived at Edoras, and convinced the king that he was not as weak as his adviser had made him seem. Upon Théoden's restoration, "many things which men had missed" were found locked in Gríma's trunk, including the king's sword, [[Herugrim]]. Théoden decided to go forth to battle at the [[Fords of Isen]], and Gríma was given a choice: prove his loyalty and ride into battle with the king, or ride into exile. Choosing the latter, he went to Saruman at [[Orthanc]]. Following the confrontation between Saruman and Gandalf, Gríma mistakenly threw the ''[[palantír]]'' of [[Orthanc]] at the [[Rohan (Middle-earth)#People|Rohirrim]] accompanying Gandalf, or possibly at Saruman himself, and so permitted its capture by [[Peregrin Took]].

=== ''The Return of the King'' ===

Gríma accompanied Saruman to the [[Shire (Middle-earth)|Shire]], where Saruman sought revenge for his defeat at Orthanc in petty tyranny over the [[Hobbit]]s. During this time, Saruman shortened Gríma's nickname to "Worm". When Saruman was overthrown by a hobbit rebellion and ordered to leave, [[Frodo Baggins]] implored Gríma not to follow him, and even offered him food and shelter. Saruman countered by revealing to the Hobbits that Gríma had murdered and possibly eaten [[Lotho Sackville-Baggins]], a kinsman of Frodo; whereupon Gríma killed [[Saruman]] and was shot by Hobbit archers.

=== ''Unfinished Tales'' ===

Gríma played a major role in the back-story to ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', prior to his first appearance in ''The Two Towers''. In ''Unfinished Tales'' Tolkien writes that on 20 September in {{ME-date|TA|3018}} Gríma was captured by the [[Nazgûl]] in the [[Rohan (Middle-earth)|fields of the Rohirrim]], while on his way to [[Isengard]] to inform Saruman of Gandalf's arrival at [[Edoras]]. He divulged what he knew of Saruman's plans to the Nazgûl, specifically his interest in the Shire, and its location. Gríma was set free, and the Nazgûl set out immediately for the Shire. In another version within the same chapter, this role is given to the ''squint-eyed southerner'' that the hobbits encounter at [[Bree (Middle-earth)|Bree]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ME-ref|UT|The Hunt for the Ring pg 340}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the same book, Tolkien intimates that Gríma may have given Théoden "subtle poisons" that caused him to age at an accelerated pace.

In [[Ralph Bakshi]]'s 1978 animated film adaptation of ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|The Lord of the Rings]]'', Gríma Wormtongue was voiced by [[Michael Deacon (actor)|Michael Deacon]] (and his name is pronounced "Grime-a").

[[Paul Brooke]] played Gríma in [[BBC Radio]]'s 1981 [[The Lord of the Rings (1981 radio series)|serialisation]].

In [[Peter Jackson]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|Lord of the Rings]]'' films, Gríma was played by [[Brad Dourif]]. According to Dourif, Jackson encouraged him to shave off his eyebrows so that the audience would immediately have a [[subliminal stimuli|subliminal]] reaction of unease to the character.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.west-of-the-moon.net/bradhour.htm  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080103033455/http://www.west-of-the-moon.net/bradhour.htm |date=3 January 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"[[The Scouring of the Shire]]" episode does not appear in the film version; the deaths of Saruman and Gríma were moved to an earlier scene, "The Voice of Saruman".  This scene was cut from the theatrical releases of the films, but can be found on the Extended Edition [[DVD]] of ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King|The Return of the King]]''.

[[File:Grima and Théoden.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Wormtongue (left) as portrayed by [[Brad Dourif]] in [[Peter Jackson]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers]]'']]

In this scene, the assembled leaders of the West ride to [[Ent]]-occupied [[Isengard]] to confront [[Saruman]].  Théoden offers Gríma [[clemency]], but when he tries to accept, Saruman curses him and knocks him down. Enraged, Gríma stabs Saruman in the back. Saruman then falls from the tower and is impaled on a spiked wheel, remnant of his war machines, and the ''[[palantír]]'' slips out of his cloak. Gríma himself is shot and killed by one of [[Legolas]]' arrows. In the DVD commentary, Jackson states that in further deleted material Saruman reveals to the company that Gríma had killed [[Théoden]]'s son [[Théodred]], casting new light on both his earlier reaction to Théodred's death and on Legolas' reason for shooting him.

=== Video games ===

In ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Third Age]]'' video game, Gríma Wormtongue is a miniboss faced by the player in the village hall. He uses powerful spells that drain Action Points, injuring and disabling the target.

In ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II]]'', Gríma Wormtongue is a hero for the Isengard faction, and can weaken, assassinate, and convert enemy units.

In ''[[The Lord of the Rings: Conquest]]'', Grima is a playable scout-type hero.

'''Harry Henry Choates''' (December 26, 1922 - July 17, 1951) was an American [[Cajun music]] fiddler known as ''Fiddle King of Cajun Swing''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.houstonculture.org/tour/texas5b.html|title=San Antonio Rose}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:harrychoates-corpus.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Red Fabacher, Pee Wee Lyons, Johnnie Mae Manuel, Harry Choates, Amos Comeaux, Curly Maples]] --&gt;
Choates' place of birth is disputed, though his State of Texas death certificate lists his birthplace as [[New Iberia, Louisiana]]. His baptism certificate lists his place of birth as [[Cow Island, Louisiana]], a small community which is south of the town of Kaplan. His baptism lists his parents as Clarence Choate and Idolie Menard. He was born Harry Henry Choate, and he added an "s" to his last name at some point after his first marriage.
He moved to [[Port Arthur, Texas]], in the 1930s, and received little schooling, instead spending time in local bars listening to music on jukeboxes. By age 12 he started playing fiddle for spare change in barbershops.

==Career==
He gained early professional experience playing in the bands of [[Leo Soileau]] and [[Leroy Leblanc]], then split off to form his own group called the Melody Boys in 1946. His 1946 song "[[Jole Blon]]", a top 10 hit (Billboard position #4) for Choates, was recorded by Quinn Recording under the [[Gold Star Records]] label (#1314).  Since Gold Star could not keep up with the demand for "Jole Blon", the record was co-released under other labels, such as [[Modern Records|Modern Music]] (#20-511), [[Starday Records|Starday]] (#187), [[D Records]] (#1024) and the [[De Luxe Records|Deluxe label]] (#6000).&lt;ref&gt;Bradley, Andy. Wood, Roger. "House of Hits: The Story of Houston's Gold Star/SugarHill Recording Studios". Brad and Michele Moore Roots Music Series. University of Texas Press; 1 edition (April 1, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; Later, it was recorded by [[country music|country]] singer [[Moon Mullican]] and became a major hit, but Choates had waived his rights to the song and was never compensated for its success.

Choates remained with the Melody Boys from 1946 to 1951, recording for Gold Star Records in 1946-47 and later for [[Macy's Recordings]]. The Melody Boys disbanded over Choates' chronic problems with [[alcoholism]] and his frequent missed concert dates, and shortly after the dissolution he played with [[Jesse James &amp; His Gang]] on [[KLBJ-AM|KTBC]] radio.

==Death==
In the middle of 1951, Choates was found to be in [[contempt of court]] for failing to pay his support payments for his children. He spent three days in the Travis County Jail, at which time he began hitting his head against the bars of his jail cell, eventually knocking himself into a coma. The condition persisted for several days before Choates died of the effects of his alcoholism on July 17, 1951.&lt;ref&gt;"Harry Choates Artist Biography" by Craig Harris.  [{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p721/biography|pure_url=yes}} Harry Choates] at [[Allmusic]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Choates is known as the "Parrain de la musique cajun" ("Godfather of Cajun music") mainly because of his introduction of vocal wailing throughout his music.&lt;ref name="bopping"&gt;{{cite web|title=Bopping. HARRY CHOATES (1922-1951), the Godfather of Cajun music.|url=http://www.bopping.org/harry-choates-1922-1951-the-godfather-of-cajun-music/|accessdate=2014-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine ranked Harry Choates' version of [[Jole Blon]] #99 in their list of the 100 greatest country songs.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.rollingstone.com/music/pictures/100-greatest-country-songs-of-all-time-20140601/99-harry-choates-jole-blon-1946-0629823&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Inna Hermanivna Bohoslovska''' ({{lang-ua|Богословська Інна Германівна}}, {{lang-ru|Богословская Инна Германовна}}, alternative spellings: ''Bogoslovska'', ''Bogoslovskaya'') is a [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] politician. She is known for her political tension with [[Yulia Tymoshenko]] as one of the main opponents. Bohoslovska was a candidate for [[President of Ukraine]] in the [[Ukrainian presidential election, 2010|2010 Ukrainian presidential elections]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unian.net/eng/news/news-317447.html MP Bohoslovska quits Party of Regions], [[UNIAN]] (May 25, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Bohoslovska was born in [[Kharkiv]] on 5 August 1960. She is married and lives with her daughter and grandson. Her father was a member of the Soviet military and worked as a teacher at a local high school; her mother was a lawyer.

In 1982 Inna Bohoslovska graduated with distinction from the Kharkiv Legal Institute (nowadays called the [[National Legal Academy of Jaroslav Mudrogo|Yaroslav Mudry National Academy of Law]]). In the same year Inna began practical work as the lawyer as a member of Bar of the [[Kharkiv Region]]. Working as a defender, Inna presided on numerous civil and criminal defence cases.

In 1989 Inna Bohoslovska undertook correspondence postgraduate study at the Institution of the State and Rights at the Academy of Sciences of the USSR.

In 1990 she participated in a Soviet-American conference on protection of human rights.

Following the conference, Inna was invited to study in the United States. However her position concerning influence of the state on judicial system mismatched the then pro-Soviet ideology of a management of institute and she had to reject the invitation at the time.

In 1992 Inna Bohoslovska was appointed to the legal board of the state Duma{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} - an advisory body to the [[President of Ukraine]]. Issues addressed included discussion and the analysis of various bills, an expert estimation of various legislative initiatives.

Inna Bohoslovska was recognised in Ukraine as a successful lawyer in her own right, not only winning a majority of litigations, but also demonstrating her ability and willingness to be a creative progressive thinker and a good understanding of economic and politics. She was one of the youngest members appointed to the structure of the state Duma{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}.

In 1998 Bohoslovska decided become actively involved in politics in Ukraine. During pre-election campaign for the [[Verkhovna Rada]] Bohoslovska stood for election as a representative of the local constituency in a Kharkov in the district in which she was born, went to school and now lives with her family and daughter.

Inna Bohoslovska, facing stiff competition from 14 other male candidates, managed to secure 34% of the vote—twice the support given to her nearest competitors, which included the leader of the city organization of the Communist Party, one of leaders of the Socialist Party and the leader of the Social-Liberal Association.

The policies advocated by Bohoslovska were based on the need for the state to carrying out much needed tax, budgetary and administrative reforms.

Having worked in the extensively in formation, development and preparation of government policy and legislation, Inna Bohoslovska was asked to become one of the founding members of the [[Viche|Party Viche]] and was subsequently elected as the first Chairman of the party in 2003. On 3 August 2007, Bohoslovska and other leaders of the party decided to participate in the [[Ukrainian parliamentary election, 2006|2007 parliamentary elections]] within [[Party of Regions]] party list.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kyivpost.com/profiles/people/dossie/bogoslovskaja Kyiv Post]&lt;/ref&gt; Ihor Didkovsky was elected as a new party leader.&lt;ref&gt;{{uk icon}} [http://www.viche.org.ua/362 Дідковський Ігор] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718165023/http://www.viche.org.ua/362 |date=2011-07-18 }}, Official party website&lt;/ref&gt; The party considered a merge into [[Party of Regions]] in 2007 and did not participate in the 2007 election&lt;ref&gt;{{uk icon}} [http://sd.net.ua/2009/09/01/partja_vche.html Партія "Віче"], www.sd.net.ua&lt;/ref&gt; (however a merger with the Party of Regions did not take place&lt;ref&gt;{{uk icon}} [http://www.viche.org.ua/partyukr Партія] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090107001712/http://www.viche.org.ua/partyukr |date=2009-01-07 }}, Official party website&lt;/ref&gt;).

May 2009 Bohoslovska quit the Party of Regions and participated in the [[Ukrainian presidential election, 2010|presidential election of the next year]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unian.net/eng/news/news-317447.html MP Bohoslovska quits Party of Regions], [[UNIAN]] (May 25, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;
Bohoslovska was excluded from the structure of the Party of Regions faction by decision of the political council of the Party of Regions in June 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unian.net/eng/news/news-322502.html Bogoslovska, Chornovil excluded from PR faction], [[UNIAN]] (June 23, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after Bohoslovska became the leader of Viche again.&lt;ref&gt;{{uk icon}} [http://www.viche.org.ua/94 команда] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091003191319/http://www.viche.org.ua/94 |date=2009-10-03 }}, Official party website&lt;/ref&gt; Bohoslovska’s 2010 campaign centred mostly on criticizing [[Yulia Tymoshenko]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kyivpost.com/news/nation/detail/52694/ Political Pulse: Presidential field takes shape], [[Kyiv Post]] (November 11, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; During the 2010 election she received 0,41% of the votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{uk icon}} [http://gazeta.ua/index.php?id=324402 ЦВК оприлюднила офіційні результати 1-го туру виборів], Gazeta.ua (January 25, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; Bohoslovska rejoined the Party of Regions faction in October 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.interfax.com.ua/eng/main/50057/ Seven individual MPs join Regions Party faction, Our Ukraine MP joins Lytvyn Bloc] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120120153322/http://www.interfax.com.ua/eng/main/50057/ |date=2012-01-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Ukrainian parliamentary election, 2012|2012 she was re-elected]] into parliament on the party list of Party of Regions.&lt;ref name="electedintoVRUK111112"&gt;{{uk icon}} [http://www.pravda.com.ua/articles/2012/11/11/6977259/ Список депутатів нової Верховної Ради], [[Ukrayinska Pravda]] (11 November 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

Following a violent crackdown on [[2013 Ukraine pro-European Union protests|protesters]] in Kiev on 30 November 2013, Bohoslovska left [[Viktor Yanukovych]]’s Party of Regions in protest, calling for the President's resignation.&lt;ref name=KP30resignations&gt;{{cite news|last=Oksana|first=Grytsenko|title=Yanukovych says police beatings not his fault|url=http://www.kyivpost.com/content/politics/yanukovych-outraged-by-maidans-break-up-threatens-to-punish-guilty-332718.html|newspaper=Kyiv Post|date=30 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John Peter Berger''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|ɜr|ɡ|ər}}; 5 November 1926 – 2 January 2017) was an English [[art critic]], novelist, painter and poet. His novel ''[[G. (novel)|G.]]'' won the 1972 [[Booker Prize]], and his essay on art criticism, ''[[Ways of Seeing]]'', written as an accompaniment to a [[BBC]] series, is often used as a university text. He lived in France for more than half a century.

==Early life==
Berger was born on 5 November 1926&lt;ref name="nytimes"/&gt; in [[Stoke Newington]], [[London]],&lt;ref name="John Berger obituary"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/jan/02/john-berger-obituary |title=John Berger obituary |work=The Guardian |publication-date=2 January 2017 |access-date=3 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="newstatesman"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.newstatesman.com/culture/2015/06/i-think-dead-are-us-john-berger-88 |title=I think the dead are with us": John Berger at 88 |work=The New Statesman |publication-date=11 June 2015 |access-date=3 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the first of two children of Miriam and Stanley Berger.&lt;ref name="theguardian"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/1999/feb/13/books.guardianreview8 |title=Contented exile |work=The Guardian |publication-date=13 February 1999 |access-date=3 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His grandfather was from [[Trieste]],&lt;ref name=NSJan10&gt;The Books Interview: John Berger: [http://www.newstatesman.com/books/2010/01/palestine-rema-israel-england The Books Interview: John Berger], accessdate: 2 January 2017&lt;/ref&gt; and his father, Stanley, raised as a non-observant [[Jew]] who converted to [[Catholicism]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Andy Merrifield]], ''John Berger'', Reaktion Books (2013), p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; had been an infantry officer on the Western Front during the [[World War I|First World War]] and was awarded the [[Military Cross]]&lt;ref name="newstatesman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="theguardian2"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/oct/30/john-berger-at-90-interview-storyteller |title=John Berger: ‘If I’m a storyteller it’s because I listen’ |work=The Guardian |publication-date=30 October 2016 |access-date=3 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]].&lt;ref name="litencyc"&gt;{{cite web|author=Duncan O'Connor |url=http://www.litencyc.com/php/speople.php?rec=true&amp;UID=380 |title=Literary Encyclopedia &amp;#124; John Berger |website=Litencyc.com |date= |accessdate=3 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Berger was educated at [[St Edward's School, Oxford]].&lt;ref name="A radical returns"/&gt; He served in the [[British Army]] from 1944 to 1946.&lt;ref name="The Atlantic Companion to Literature in English"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A_YatfLrgnMC&amp;q=John+berger#v=snippet&amp;q=John%20berger&amp;f=false |title=The Atlantic Companion to Literature in English |last=Ray |first=Ed.

==Career==
Berger began his career as a painter&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-38492516 |title=John Berger, art critic and author of Ways of Seeing, dies |publisher=BBC |publication-date=2 January 2017 |access-date=3 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and exhibited works at a number of London galleries in the late 1940s.&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt;&lt;ref name="litencyc" /&gt; His art has been shown at the Wildenstein, Redfern and [[Leicester Galleries]] in London.&lt;ref name="John Berger obituary"/&gt;

Berger taught drawing at [[St Mary's University, Twickenham|St Mary's teacher training college]].&lt;ref name="John Berger obituary"/&gt; He later became an art critic, publishing many essays and reviews in the ''[[New Statesman]]''.&lt;ref name="John Berger obituary"/&gt;&lt;ref name="washingtonpost"/&gt; His [[Marxist humanism]]&lt;ref name="dictionaryofarthistorians"&gt;{{cite web|title=Berger, John [Peter]|url=http://arthistorians.info/bergerj|website=arthistorians.info}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his strongly stated opinions on [[modern art]] combined to make him a controversial figure early in his career.&lt;ref name="lareviewofbooks"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/a-smuggling-operation-john-bergers-theory-of-art/ |title=A Smuggling Operation: John Berger’s Theory of Art |work=LARB |publication-date=2 January 2017 |access-date=5 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a statement of political commitment, he titled an early collection of essays ''Permanent Red''.&lt;ref name="newrepublic"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://newrepublic.com/article/126679/many-faces-john-berger |title=The Many Faces of John Berger |work=New Republic |publication-date=30 December 2015 |access-date=5 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Berger was never a formal member of the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]] (CPGB): rather he was a close associate of it and its front, the [[Artists' International Association|Artists’ International Association]] (AIA), until the latter disappeared in 1953. He was active in the Geneva Club, a discussion group that appears to have overlapped with British communist circles in the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://weeklyworker.co.uk/worker/1140/berger-and-stalinism/|title=Berger and Stalinism|last=Parker|first=Lawrence|date=2 February 2017|website=Weekly Worker|access-date=19 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publishing==
In 1958, Berger published his first novel, ''A Painter of Our Time'',&lt;ref name="John Berger, art critic and author, dies aged 90"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/jan/02/john-berger-art-critic-and-author-dies-aged-90 |title=John Berger, art critic and author, dies aged 90 |work=The Guardian |publication-date=2 January 2017 |access-date=3 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; which tells the story of the disappearance of Janos Lavin, a fictional exiled Hungarian painter, and his diary's discovery by an art critic friend called John.&lt;ref name="theweek"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.theweek.co.uk/80124/john-berger-five-key-works-by-the-late-art-critic |title=John Berger: Five key works by the late art critic |work=The Week |publication-date=3 January 2017 |access-date=4 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work was withdrawn by the publisher under pressure from the [[Congress for Cultural Freedom]] a month after its publication.&lt;ref name="litencyc"/&gt; His next novels were ''The Foot of Clive'' and ''Corker's Freedom'';&lt;ref name="John Berger obituary"/&gt; both of which presented an urban English life of alienation and melancholy. Berger moved to Quincy in the [[Haute-Savoie]], France in 1962 due to his distaste for life in Britain.&lt;ref name="John Berger obituary"/&gt;

In 1972, the [[BBC]] broadcast his television series ''[[Ways of Seeing]]''&lt;ref name="John Berger obituary"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt;&lt;ref name="theweek"/&gt; and published its companion text, an introduction to the study of images. The work was derived in part  from [[Walter Benjamin]]'s essay "[[The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction]]".&lt;ref name="Digital Humanities Pedagogy: Practices, Principles and Politics"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GmImK8hCPjcC&amp;q=ways+of+seeing+based+on+The+Work+of+Art+in+the+Age+of+Mechanical+Reproduction#v=snippet&amp;q=ways%20of%20seeing%20based%20on%20The%20Work%20of%20Art%20in%20the%20Age%20of%20Mechanical%20Reproduction&amp;f=false |title=Digital Humanities Pedagogy: Practices, Principles and Politics |publisher=Open Book Publishers |year=2012 |isbn=9781909254251 |page=301}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Berger's novel ''[[G. (novel)|G.]]'', a [[picaresque]] romance set in Europe in 1898, won the [[James Tait Black Memorial Prize]] and the [[Booker Prize]] in 1972.&lt;ref name="John Berger obituary"/&gt; Berger donated half the Booker cash prize to the [[Black Panther Party]] in Britain, and retained half to support his work on the study on migrant workers that became ''[[A Seventh Man]]'', asserting that both endeavors represented  aspects of his political struggle.&lt;ref name="John Berger obituary"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Michael |last=McNay |title=Berger turns tables on Booker |url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/1972/nov/24/mainsection.fromthearchive |work=The Guardian |date=24 November 1972 |accessdate=5 December 2009 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1974, Berger co-founded the [[For Beginners, LLC|Writers and Readers Publishing Cooperative Ltd]] in London with [[Arnold Wesker]], [[Lisa Appignanesi]], [[Richard Appignanesi]], [[Chris Searle]], [[Glenn Thompson (publisher)|Glenn Thompson,]] [[Sian Williams|Siân Williams]], and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paraprincipiantes.com/html/quienes.shtml |title=Libros para Principiantes: Quienes somos |website=Paraprincipiantes.com |date= |accessdate=3 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cooperative was active until the early 1980s.&lt;ref name="aalbc"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://aalbc.com/reviews/remembering_glenn_thompson.htm |title=Remembering Glenn Thompson |work=African American Literature Book Club |access-date=5 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In later essays, Berger wrote about photography, art, politics, and memory. He published in ''The Shape of a Pocket'' a correspondence with [[Subcomandante Marcos]],&lt;ref name="publico"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.publico.pt/2017/01/02/culturaipsilon/noticia/morreu-john-berger-um-artista-total-1756862 |title=Morreu John Berger, um artista (e um espectador) total |work=Publico |publication-date=2 January 2017 |access-date=4 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and penned short stories that appeared in ''[[The Threepenny Review]]'' and ''[[The New Yorker]]''.  His sole volume of poetry is ''Pages of the Wound'', though other volumes, such as the theoretical essay ''And Our Faces, My Heart, Brief as Photos'' contain poetry. His later novels include ''To the Wedding'', a love story dealing with the [[AIDS]] crisis,&lt;ref name="theguardian2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Making Sense: Sense Perception in the British Novel of the 1980s and 1990s"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nCIlg2dR5q0C&amp;q=To+the+wedding#v=snippet&amp;q=To%20the%20wedding&amp;f=false |title=Making Sense: Sense Perception in the British Novel of the 1980s and 1990s |last=Hertel |first=Ralf |publisher=Rodopi |year=2005 |isbn=9789042018648 |page=74}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[King: A Street Story]]'', a novel about homelessness and shantytown life told from the perspective of a stray dog.&lt;ref name="theguardian"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Making Sense: Sense Perception in the British Novel of the 1980s and 1990s"/&gt; Initially, Berger insisted that his name be kept off the cover and title page of ''King'', wanting the novel to be received on its own merits.&lt;ref name="the telegraph"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/4724662/Portrait-of-the-artist-as-a-wild-old-man.html |title=Portrait of the artist as a wild old man |work=The Telegraph |publication-date=23 July 2001 |access-date=4 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Joshua Kekaulahao''' ({{circa|1824}} – May 7, 1856) was a politician and judge in the [[Kingdom of Hawaii]]. His name is often spelled ''Kekaulahau''.

==Biography==
Born around 1824,  Kekaulahao was the son of A. Kaina, who was a captain of the interisland steamer ''Akamai''.&lt;ref name="KekaulahaoBurial"&gt;{{cite news |title= They Are Passing Away |date= December 16, 1858 |newspaper= The Pacific Commercial Advertiser |url= http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn82015418/1858-12-16/ed-1/seq-2/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="KekaulahaoDied"&gt;{{cite news |title= Died |date= May 10, 1856 |newspaper= The Polynesian |url= http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn82015408/1856-05-10/ed-1/seq-2/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; A sister of his married [[Jonah Kapena]]. Kekaulahao also had a son who died in the [[smallpox]] epidemic of 1853. A vaccination administered by a Honolulu physician failed to save the child, and he died at [[Lahaina]] after bathing in the sea to alleviate the malignant case of smallpox.{{sfn|Greer|1965|page=237}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= A Lover of Justice |date= September 3, 1853 |newspaper= The Polynesian |url= http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn82015408/1853-09-03/ed-1/seq-2/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1853 epidemic resulted in about and 2,485 reported deaths but the death toll was probably as high as five or six thousand, about eight percent of the islands' population.{{sfn|Van Dyke|2008|page=21}}{{sfn|Kuykendall|1965|pages=411–413}}{{sfn|Kohn|2008|pages=158–159}} The Hawaiian government made smallpox vaccination compulsory in 1854.{{sfn|Greer|1965|pages=237–238}}

Kekaulahao was one of the first generation of [[Native Hawaiians|Hawaiians]] to receive a western education by the [[List of Missionaries to Hawaii|American missionaries]] who arrived in Hawaii in 1820. In 1836, he began his education at [[Lahainaluna Seminary]] and graduated in 1841. Some of his classmates included writer [[S. N. Haleole]], historian [[Samuel Kamakau]] and future royal governor [[George Luther Kapeau]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Papa Inoa O Ke Kula Nui O Lahainaluna |date= May 19, 1858 |newspaper= Ka Hae Hawaii |url= http://nupepa-hawaii.com/2014/05/30/lahainaluna-school-student-roster-where-it-all-started-1858/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;
After graduating from Lahainaluna, Kekaulahao became a practicing attorney in the early days of the kingdom. He entered the service of the Hawaiian government as a [[Clerk (legislature)|clerk]] for the House of Nobles in the 1846 session of the [[Legislature of the Hawaiian Kingdom|Hawaiian legislature]].{{sfn|Osorio|2002|pages=72, 76, 93}}{{sfn|Hawaii|Lydecker|1918|page=23}} Throughout much of the early 1850s, he led an active career in the politics of the kingdom.
In 1851, he was elected as a member of the House of Representatives, the lower house of the legislature, representing the district of ʻEwa, Oʻahu.{{sfn|Osorio|2002|page=69}} Kekaulahao would serve as a representative from 1851 to 1852. On April 14, 1853, he was elevated to the position of a member of the House of Nobles, the upper house of the legislature traditionally reserved for the chiefs, serving until 1855.{{sfn|Osorio|2002|page=109}}
Initially serving as a secretary on the Board of Land Commissioners, he succeeded [[Zorobabela Kaʻauwai]] as one of the commissioners on the board after Kaʻauwai's resignation. The board was in charge of settling or quieting land claims of the [[Great Māhele]]. He served on the board from 1850 to 1855.{{sfn|Kuykendall|1965|page=280}}{{sfn|Hawaii. Dept. of the Interior|1853|page=30}}{{sfn|Van Dyke|2008|page=35}} In April 24, 1855, Kekaulahao was appointed Circuit Judge for Oʻahu succeeding his cousin [[John Kalili]], who died in office.&lt;ref name="KekaulahaoRecords"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archives1.dags.hawaii.gov/gsdl/collect/governme/import/import/Government%20Office%20Holders%20-%20Name%20IMJ/K/Kekaulahao,%20Joshua.jpg |title= Kekaulahao, Joshua office record |work=state archives digital collections |publisher=state of Hawaii |accessdate= June 17, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kekaulahao died on May 7, 1856 in [[Honolulu]] at the age of thirty-two.&lt;ref name="KekaulahaoDied"/&gt; Two years later in 1858, he and five members of his family including his younger brother, father, son, sister, and cousin John Kalili were buried in the cemetery of the [[Kawaiahaʻo Church]] in a ceremony which included the use of [[Niihau]] mats as burial goods.&lt;ref name="KekaulahaoBurial"/&gt;

Alcoff has called for greater inclusion of historically underrepresented groups in philosophy and notes that philosophers from these groups have created new fields of inquiry, including [[feminist philosophy]], [[critical race theory]], and LGBTQ philosophy.&lt;ref name=Mann&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mann|first=Bonnie|title=Three White Men Walk into a Bar|journal=Radical Philosophy Review|year=2013|volume=16|issue=3|pages=733–746|doi=10.5840/radphilrev201316354}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CHE&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wilson|first=Robin|title=Women Challenge Male Philosophers to Make Room in Unfriendly Field|url=http://www.chronicle.com/article/Female-Philosophers-Shake-Up/136629/|journal=Chronicle of Higher Education|date=2013-01-18|volume=59|issue=19|pages=A1-A6}}&lt;/ref&gt; To help address these issues, with Paul Taylor and William Wilkerson, she started "The Pluralist’s Guide to Philosophy".&lt;ref name=TPM&gt;{{cite journal|last=O'Connor|first=James|title=Pluralist Guide scrutinised|journal=The Philosophers Magazine|date=Jan{{ndash}}Mar 2012|issue=56|page=6|url=http://onlinedigeditions.com/publication/?i=91079&amp;p=8|accessdate=February 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 2012 to 2013 she served as president of the [[American Philosophical Association]], Eastern Division.&lt;ref name=APApast&gt;{{cite web|title=APA Divisional Presidents &amp; Addresses|url=http://www.apaonline.org/?page=presidents|publisher=American Philosophical Association|accessdate=February 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2018 she was appointed president of the board of directors of Hypatia, Inc., the non-profit corporation that owns the feminist philosophy journal [[Hypatia (journal)|''Hypatia'']].&lt;ref name=search23Feb2018&gt;{{cite web|title=Announcement from Hypatia's Board of Directors and Task Force Co-Chairs|url=http://hypatiaphilosophy.org/announcements/announcement-hypatias-board-directors-task-force-co-chairs/|publisher=''Hypatia''|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180301164503/http://hypatiaphilosophy.org/announcements/announcement-hypatias-board-directors-task-force-co-chairs/|archivedate=1 March 2018|date=23 February 2018|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Weinberg24July2017&gt;{{cite news|last1=Weinberg|first1=Justin|title=Hypatia’s Associate Editors Resign|url=http://dailynous.com/2017/07/24/hypatias-associate-editors-resign/|work=Daily Nous|date=24 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Alcoff was born in Panama,&lt;ref name=YancyAlcoff/&gt; the second of two girls to an Irish mother, Laura, and Panamanian father, Miguel Angel Martín, who met each other while studying at [[Florida State University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Alcoff|first1=Linda Martin|title=The Future of Whiteness|date=2015|publisher=Polity Press|location=Cambridge and Malden|pages=30–31, 34}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her father became a professor of history at the [[Universidad de Panama]].&lt;ref&gt;Alcoff, Linda Martín (2006). ''Visible Identities: Race, Gender and the Self''. Oxford University Press. pp. vii, 8.&lt;/ref&gt; When her parents separated, Alcoff moved with her mother and sister to Florida when she was three.&lt;ref name=YancyAlcoff&gt;{{cite news|last1=Yancy|first1=George|last2=Alcoff|first2=Linda Martín|title=Philosophy’s Lost Body and Soul|url=https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/02/04/philosophys-lost-body-and-soul/|work=The New York Times|date=4 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1980 she earned a BA with honors in philosophy from [[Georgia State University]] and in 1983 an MA, also in philosophy. She did her doctoral work at [[Brown University]], completing her dissertation under the direction of [[Ernest Sosa]], [[Martha Nussbaum]], and [[Richard Schmitt]] and receiving her PhD in 1987.&lt;ref name=CV/&gt;

==Career==
===Positions held===
After spending a year as assistant professor of philosophy at [[Kalamazoo College]], Alcoff moved to [[Syracuse University]], where she taught for the next ten years. She was tenured and promoted to associate professor in 1995 and full professor in 1999. She held visiting positions at [[Cornell University]] (1994–1995), [[Aarhus University]] (November 1999), [[Florida Atlantic University]] (Fall 2000), and Brown University (Spring 2001). She took a position as professor of philosophy and women's studies at [[SUNY Stony Brook]] in 2002–2003. In 2009 she became professor of philosophy at [[Hunter College]] and the [[City University of New York Graduate Center]].&lt;ref name=CV&gt;{{cite web|last=Alcoff|first=Linda Martín|title=Curriculum Vitae|url=http://www.alcoff.com/curriculum-vitae|publisher=www.alcoff.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2010 to 2013 Alcoff was joint editor-in-chief, with [[Ann Cudd]], of the feminist philosophy journal [[Hypatia (journal)|''Hypatia'']].&lt;ref name=editorialboardMarch2018&gt;{{cite web|title=Editorial board|url=http://hypatiaphilosophy.org/about/editorialboard/|publisher=''Hypatia''|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180301224919/http://hypatiaphilosophy.org/about/editorialboard/|archivedate=1 March 2018|date=1 March 2018|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; She served on its board of associate editors during the [[Hypatia transracialism controversy]] in 2017, when the associate editors controversially issued a public apology for the publication of a peer-reviewed article in ''Hypatia'' that compared [[Transracial (identity)|transracialism]] to the decision to change [[Transgender|gender expression]].&lt;ref name=Brubaker18May2017&gt;[[Rogers Brubaker|Brubaker, Roger]] (18 May 2017).

===Research===
Alcoff has written widely on subjects including Foucault, sexual violence, the politics of epistemology, gender and race identity, and Latino issues.&lt;ref name=CV/&gt;  She has authored three books - ''Real Knowing: New Versions of Coherence Theory'' (1996), ''Visible Identities: Race, Gender and the Self'' (2006), and ''The Future of Whiteness'' (2015).&lt;ref name=CV/&gt;  She has also edited ten volumes, written a large number of peer-reviewed articles, and contributed a large number of book and encyclopedia chapters and entries.&lt;ref name=CV/&gt;

''Visible Identities: Race, Gender and the Self'' attempted to offer a unified account of social identity by bridging her previous work in epistemology, metaphysics, and the politics of ethnicity, race, and gender.&lt;ref name=ndpr1&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sundstrom|first=Ronald|title=Visible Identities: Race, Gender and the Self (Review)|url=http://ndpr.nd.edu/news/visible-identities-race-gender-and-the-self/|journal=Notre Dame Philosophical Review|date=22 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In it, Alcoff suggested that geographic location has significant implications for social identity above and beyond those conveyed by other contributors to identity (although she does not view such implications as deterministic).&lt;ref name=ndpr1/&gt;

===Awards===
Alcoff has received several honors and awards, including an honorary doctorate from the [[University of Oslo]] in September 2011, and the Caribbean Philosophical Association's Frantz Fanon Prize for 2009 for her book ''Visible Identities: Race, Gender and the Self''. She was recognized as a Distinguished Woman in Philosophy by the [[Society for Women in Philosophy]] in 2005, and held the Meredith Professorship for Excellence in Teaching at Syracuse University from 1995–1998.&lt;ref name=CV/&gt;

==Early life (1949–1976)==
Mark Freuder Knopfler was born on 12 August 1949 in [[Glasgow]], Scotland, to an English mother, Louisa Mary, and a [[Hungarian-Jewish]] father, Erwin Knopfler.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chessscotland.com/archives/knopfler.htm |title=Chess Scotland |publisher=Chess Scotland |date=27 November 2005 |accessdate=30 June 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130810190402/http://chessscotland.com/archives/knopfler.htm |archivedate=10 August 2013  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanhungarianfederation.org/FamousHungarians/filmartsandmedia.htm |title=AHF Presents: Nobel Prize Winners and Famous Hungarians: The American Hungarian Federation, founded 1906 (hires magyarok es olimpiai bajnokok) – Film, Arts and Media |publisher=Americanhungarianfederation.org |date= |accessdate=30 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lifetimetv.co.uk/biography/biography-mark-knopfler |title=BIOGRAPHY: Mark Knopfler Lifetime |publisher=Lifetimetv.co.uk |date=12 August 1949 |accessdate=30 June 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140702151208/http://lifetimetv.co.uk/biography/biography-mark-knopfler |archivedate=2 July 2014  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="encyclopedia.com"&gt;{{cite web|title=Mark (Freuder) Knopfler |work=Encyclopedia.com |url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/article-1G2-3414800180/knopfler-mark-freuder-1949.html |accessdate=8 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- In the BBC Four TV series called ''Mark Lawson Talks To ...'', Knopfler describes his father as being a Marxist agnostic. http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01r5vs7 --&gt; His mother was a teacher and his father was an architect and a chess player whose anti-fascist sympathies and Jewish parentage forced him to flee from his native Hungary in 1939.&lt;ref name="chess-scotland"&gt;{{cite web |title=Erwin Knopfler (1909–1993) |work=Chess Scotland |date= |url=http://www.chessscotland.com/archives/knopfler.htm |accessdate=8 September 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130810190402/http://chessscotland.com/archives/knopfler.htm |archivedate=10 August 2013  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Knopfler later described his father as a [[Marxist]] agnostic.&lt;ref&gt;Irwin, Colin. ''Dire Straits''. Orion, 1994. {{ISBN|1-85797-584-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Knopflers originally lived in the Glasgow area and Mark Knopfler's younger brother [[David Knopfler|David]] was also born there, on 27 December 1952. The family moved to Knopfler's mother's hometown of [[Blyth, Northumberland|Blyth]], near [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]], in [[North East England]] when he was seven years old. Mark had attended [[Bearsden]] Primary school in Scotland for two years, but both brothers attended [[Gosforth Grammar School]].

Originally inspired by his uncle Kingsley's harmonica and [[boogie-woogie]] piano playing, Mark soon became familiar with many different styles of music. Although he hounded his father for an expensive Fiesta Red [[Fender Stratocaster]] [[electric guitar]] just like [[Hank Marvin]]'s, he had to settle for a £50 twin-[[Pick up (music technology)|pick-up]] [[Höfner]] Super Solid, more in line with the family's income.&lt;ref name="authorizedbiography"&gt;{{cite web |last=Kilburn |first=Terry |title=Mark Knopfler Authorized Biography |url=http://www.mark-knopfler-news.co.uk/biogs/mark.html |publisher=Mark Knopfler News |accessdate=15 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/64wnymMce?url=http://www.mark-knopfler-news.co.uk/biogs/mark.html |archivedate=25 January 2012  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1963, when he was 14, he took a Saturday job at the [[Evening Chronicle|Newcastle Evening Chronicle]] newspaper earning six shillings and six pence. Here he met the ageing poet [[Basil Bunting]], who was a copy editor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/mark-knopfler-immortalises-chronicle-song-8864390|title=Mark Knopfler immortalises The Chronicle in song on new album|last=Robson|first=Ian|date=18 March 2015|work=nechronicle|access-date=1 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two had little to say to each other but in 2015 Knopfler wrote a track in tribute to him.

During the 1960s, he formed and joined several bands and listened to singers like [[Elvis Presley]] and guitarists [[Chet Atkins]], [[Scotty Moore]], [[B.B King]], [[Django Reinhardt]], [[Hank Marvin]], and [[James Burton]]. At sixteen years old, he made a local television appearance as part of a harmony duo, with his classmate Sue Hercombe.&lt;ref name="authorizedbiography"/&gt;

In 1968, after studying journalism for a year at [[Harlow College]],&lt;ref name="authorizedbiography"/&gt;&lt;ref name="harlow-college"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.harlow-college.ac.uk/cms_/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=section&amp;id=18&amp;Itemid=140|title=Harlow College – Home |publisher=harlow-college.ac.uk|accessdate=2 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Knopfler was hired as a [[Journalist|junior reporter]] in [[Leeds]] for the ''[[Yorkshire Evening Post]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leedstoday.net/ViewArticle.aspx?SectionID=102&amp;ArticleID=1037448|title=Chaos on the Sheepscar Interchange|publisher=Leedstoday.net|accessdate=27 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, he made the acquaintance of local furniture restorer, country blues enthusiast and part time performer [[Steve Phillips (musician)|Steve Phillips]], one year his senior, from whose record collection and guitar style Knopfler acquired a good knowledge of early blues artists and their styles; the two subsequently formed a duo called "The Duolian String Pickers", which performed in local folk and acoustic blues venues.&lt;ref name="markknopfler"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.markknopfler.com/duolian-string-pickers-days/|title=Duolian String Pickers Days : MarkKnopfler.com|publisher=markknopfler.com|accessdate=2 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later, he decided to further his education, and later graduated with a degree in English at the [[University of Leeds]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://tldynamic.leeds.ac.uk/leedsyorkshire/graduates/index.html]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061016081543/http://tldynamic.leeds.ac.uk/leedsyorkshire/graduates/index.html |date=16 October 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1970, while living in Leeds, Knopfler recorded a demo disk of an original song he had written, "Summer's Coming My Way". The recording included Knopfler (guitar and vocals), Steve Phillips (second guitar), Dave Johnson (bass), and Paul Granger (percussion). Johnson, Granger, and vocalist Mick Dewhirst played with Knopfler in a band called Silverheels; Phillips was later to rejoin Knopfler in the short lived side exercise from Dire Straits, [[The Notting Hillbillies]].

Upon graduation in 1973, Knopfler moved to London and joined a band based in [[High Wycombe]] called [[Brewers Droop]], appearing on the album ''[[The Booze Brothers]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Steve Huey |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/the-booze-brothers-mw0000205981 |title=The Booze Brothers - Brewers Droop &amp;#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits |publisher=AllMusic |date= |accessdate=18 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; One night, while spending time with friends, the only guitar available was an old acoustic with a badly warped neck that had been strung with extra-light strings to make it usable. Even so, he found it impossible to play unless he finger-picked it. He said in a later interview, "That was where I found my "voice" on guitar." After a brief stint with Brewers Droop, Knopfler took a job as a lecturer at [[Epping Forest College|Loughton College]] in [[Essex]] – a position he held for three years. Throughout this time, he continued performing with local [[pub]] bands, including the Café Racers.&lt;ref name="musicianguide"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musicianguide.com/biographies/1608000435/Dire-Straits.html|title=Dire Straits Biography|year=2009|work=Musician Guide|publisher=Net Industries|accessdate=6 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the mid-1970s, Knopfler devoted much of his musical energies to his group, the Café Racers. His brother David moved to London, where he shared a flat with [[John Illsley]], a guitarist who changed over to playing bass guitar. In April 1977, Mark moved out of his flat in [[Buckhurst Hill]] and moved in with David and John. The three began playing music together, and soon Mark invited John to join the Café Racers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Kilburn |first=Terry |title=Mark Knopfler Biography |url=http://www.sing365.com/music/lyric.nsf/mark-knopfler-biography/a890958919ee74784825688c00135994 |accessdate=12 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929011638/http://www.sing365.com/music/lyric.nsf/Mark-Knopfler-Biography/A890958919EE74784825688C00135994 |archivedate=29 September 2011  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dire Straits (1977–1995)==
{{Main article|Dire Straits}}
[[File:Mark Knopfler -1979.jpg|thumb|upright|Knopfler with Dire Straits, 1979]]
Dire Straits' first demos were done in three sessions in 1977, with [[David Knopfler]] as rhythm guitarist, [[John Illsley]] as bass guitarist, and [[Pick Withers]] as drummer. On 27 July 1977 they recorded the demo tapes of five songs: "Wild West End," "[[Sultans of Swing]]," "Down to the Waterline," "Sacred Loving" (a David Knopfler song), and "Water of Love." They later recorded "Southbound Again," "In the Gallery," and "Six Blade Knife" for [[BBC Radio London]]—and, finally, on 9 November, made demo tapes of "[[Setting Me Up]]," "Eastbound Train," and "Real Girl." Many of these songs reflect Knopfler's experiences in Newcastle, Leeds, and London, and were featured on their first album, the eponymous ''[[Dire Straits (album)|Dire Straits]],'' which was released in the following year: "Down to the Waterline" recalled images of life in Newcastle; "In The Gallery" is a tribute to a Leeds sculptor and artist named Harry Phillips (father of [[Steve Phillips (musician)|Steve Phillips]]); and "Lions," "Wild West End," and "Eastbound Train" were all drawn from Knopfler's early days in the capital.{{cn|date=September 2018}}

On its initial release, the album ''Dire Straits'' received little fanfare in the UK, but when "Sultans of Swing" was released as a single, it became a chart hit in the Netherlands and album sales took off – first across Europe, and then in the United States and Canada, and finally the UK. The group's second album, ''[[Communiqué (Dire Straits album)|Communiqué]],'' produced by [[Jerry Wexler]] and [[Barry Beckett]], followed in 1979, reaching number one in France while the first album was still at number three.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}

There were frequent personnel changes within Dire Straits after the release of their third album, ''[[Making Movies]],'' with Mark Knopfler remaining a constant member. Released in 1980, ''Making Movies'' moved towards more complex arrangements and production, which continued for the remainder of the group's career. The album included many of Mark Knopfler's most personal compositions, most notably "[[Romeo and Juliet (Dire Straits song)|Romeo and Juliet]]" and "[[Tunnel of Love (Dire Straits song)|Tunnel of Love]]."

The studio album which followed was ''[[Love Over Gold]],'' released in 1982. This featured the tracks "[[Private Investigations]]," "[[Telegraph Road (song)|Telegraph Road]]," "[[Industrial Disease (song)|Industrial Disease]]," "It Never Rains," and the [[Love Over Gold (Dire Straits song)|title track]] to the same album.

With ''Love Over Gold'' still in the albums charts, the band released a four-song [[Extended play|EP]] titled ''[[ExtendedancEPlay]]'' in early 1983. Featuring the hit single "Twisting by the Pool", this was the first output by the band that featured new drummer [[Terry Williams (drummer)|Terry Williams]], (formerly of [[Rockpile]]), who had replaced Pick Withers in November 1982. An eight-month-long world tour followed, which finished in July 1983 with two sold out concerts at London's [[Hammersmith Odeon]], and in March 1984 the double album ''[[Alchemy: Dire Straits Live|Alchemy Live]]'' was released, which documented the recordings of these final two live shows. It was also released in [[VHS]] video and reached number three in the [[UK Albums Chart]].

During 1983 and 1984, Knopfler was involved with other projects as well, including writing and producing the music score to the film ''[[Local Hero (album)|Local Hero]]'', which was a great success,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/local-hero-r42531|title=Local Hero (Original Soundtrack) – Mark Knopfler|work=AllMusic|accessdate=27 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it was followed in 1984 by his scores for the films ''[[Cal (1984 film)|Cal]]'' and ''[[Comfort and Joy (1984 film)|Comfort and Joy]]''. Also during this time Knopfler produced [[Bob Dylan]]'s ''[[Infidels (Bob Dylan album)|Infidels]]'' album, as well as ''[[Knife (album)|Knife]]'' by [[Aztec Camera]]. He also wrote the song "[[Private Dancer (Tina Turner song)|Private Dancer]]" for [[Tina Turner]]'s comeback album [[Private Dancer|of the same name]].

Dire Straits' biggest studio album by far was their fifth, ''[[Brothers in Arms (Dire Straits album)|Brothers in Arms]]'', recorded at [[Air Studios]] [[Montserrat]] and released in May 1985. It became an international blockbuster that has now sold more than 30&amp;nbsp;million copies worldwide, and is the fourth best selling album in UK chart history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/2859527.stm|title=Mark Knopfler hurt in crash|publisher=News.bbc.co.uk|accessdate=27 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6151050.stm|title=Queen head all-time sales chart|publisher=News.bbc.co.uk|accessdate=27 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Brothers in Arms'' spawned several chart singles including the US # 1 hit "[[Money for Nothing (song)|Money for Nothing]]", which was the first video played on MTV in Britain. It was also the first compact disc to sell a million copies and is largely credited for launching the CD format as it was also one of the first [[SPARS code|DDD]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.ecoustics.com/bbs/messages/10381/379607.html|title=Digitally Recorded, Digitally re/mixed and Digitally Mastered (psg)|publisher=News.ecoustics.com|accessdate=27 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; CDs ever released. Other successful singles were "[[So Far Away (Dire Straits song)|So Far Away]]", "[[Walk of Life]]", and the album's [[Brothers in Arms (song)|title track]]. The band's 1985–86 world tour of over 230&lt;ref name="authorizedbiography"/&gt; shows was immensely successful.

After the ''Brothers in Arms'' tour Dire Straits ceased to work together for some time, Knopfler concentrating mainly on film soundtracks. Knopfler joined the charity ensemble [[Charity record|Ferry Aid]] on "[[Let It Be (Ferry Aid song)|Let It Be]]" in the wake of the [[MS Herald of Free Enterprise|Zeebrugge ferry disaster]]. The song reached No. 1 on the UK singles chart in March 1987. Knopfler wrote the music score for the film ''[[The Princess Bride (film)|The Princess Bride]]'', released at the end of 1987.

Mark Knopfler also took part in a comedy skit (featured on the [[French and Saunders]] Show) titled ''The Easy Guitar Book Sketch'' with comedian [[Rowland Rivron]] and fellow British musicians [[David Gilmour]], [[Lemmy]] from Motörhead, [[Mark King (musician)|Mark King]] from Level 42, and [[Gary Moore]]. Phil Taylor explained in an interview that Knopfler used Gilmour's guitar rig and managed to sound like himself when performing in the skit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.davidgilmourblog.com/2007/12/dvd-draw.html|title=David Gilmour – DVD Draw|publisher=Davidgilmourblog.com|accessdate=27 September 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140105134905/http://www.davidgilmourblog.com/2007/12/dvd-draw.html|archivedate=5 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dire Straits regrouped for 11 June 1988 [[Nelson Mandela 70th Birthday Tribute]] concert at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]], in which they were the headline act, and were accompanied by [[Elton John]] and [[Eric Clapton]],&lt;ref name="knopfler1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mark-knopfler-news.co.uk/biogs/mark.html |title=Mark Knopfler Authorized Biography |publisher=Mark-knopfler-news.co.uk |accessdate=30 June 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/64wnymMce?url=http://www.mark-knopfler-news.co.uk/biogs/mark.html |archivedate=25 January 2012  }}&lt;/ref&gt; who by this time had developed a strong friendship with Knopfler. Shortly after this, drummer Terry Williams left the band. In September 1988 Mark Knopfler announced the official dissolution of Dire Straits, saying that he "needed a rest".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-8079134.html|title=Dire Straits Biography on Enotes.com|publisher=Highbeam.com|accessdate=27 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1988, a compilation album, ''[[Money for Nothing (album)|Money for Nothing]]'', was released and reached number one in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name=CHRT&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gZIjT8PgJMEC&amp;pg=PA282&amp;dq=private+investigations+dire+straits&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=SAAcTcmEE4iChQeP-pW3Dg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CEIQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=private%20investigations%20dire%20straits&amp;f=false|title=''International Who's Who in Popular Music|publisher=Books.google.com|accessdate=27 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, Knopfler formed [[the Notting Hillbillies]],&lt;ref name="authorizedbiography"/&gt; a band at the other end of the commercial spectrum. It leaned heavily towards American roots music – [[Folk music|folk]], [[Blues music|blues]] and [[country music]]. The band members included keyboardist [[Guy Fletcher]], with [[Brendan Croker]] and [[Steve Phillips (musician)|Steve Phillips]]. For both the album and the tour [[Paul Franklin (musician)|Paul Franklin]] was added to the line-up on pedal steel. The Notting Hillbillies sole studio album, ''[[Missing...Presumed Having a Good Time]]'' was released in 1990, and Knopfler then toured with the Notting Hillbillies for the remainder of that year. He further emphasised his country music influences with his 1990s collaboration with [[Chet Atkins]], ''[[Neck and Neck]]'', which won three Grammy awards. The Hillbillies toured the UK in early 1990 with a limited number of shows. In this low-key tour the band packed out smaller venues such as Newcastle University.

[[File:Dire Straits 1985 Mark Knopfler Alan Clark Jack Sonni.jpg|thumb|Knopfler with Dire Straits performing in Belgrade, 10 May 1985]]
In 1990, Knopfler, John Illsley, and Alan Clark performed as Dire Straits at Knebworth, joined by Eric Clapton, [[Ray Cooper]], and guitarist [[Phil Palmer]] (who was at that time part of Eric Clapton's touring band), and in January the following year, Knopfler, John Illsley and manager [[Ed Bicknell]] decided to reform Dire Straits. Knopfler, Illsley, Alan Clark, and Guy Fletcher set about recording what turned out to be their final studio album accompanied by several part-time [[sideman|sidemen]], including Phil Palmer, pedal steel guitarist [[Paul Franklin (musician)|Paul Franklin]], percussionist [[Danny Cummings]] and [[Toto (band)|Toto]] drummer [[Jeff Porcaro]].

The follow-up to ''Brothers in Arms'' was finally released in September 1991. ''[[On Every Street]]'' was nowhere near as popular as its predecessor, and met with a mixed critical reaction, with some reviewers regarding the album as an underwhelming comeback after a six-year break. Nonetheless, the album sold well and reached No. 1 in the UK. A gruelling world tour to accompany the album followed, which lasted until the end of 1992. This was Dire Straits' final world tour; it was not as well received as the previous ''Brothers in Arms'' tour, and by this time Mark Knopfler had had enough of such huge operations. This drove the band into the ground, and ultimately led to the group's final dissolution in 1995.&lt;ref name="musicianguide2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musicianguide.com/biographies/1608000435/Dire-Straits.html |title=Dire Straits lyrics, music, biography, records, band, album, videos, CD, and the discography including Dire Straits famous works |publisher=Musicianguide.com |date= |accessdate=1 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the tour, Knopfler took some time off from the music business. In 1993, he received an honorary music doctorate from the University of Newcastle upon Tyne.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musicianguide.com/biographies/1608000435/Dire-Straits.html |title=Dire Straits Biography |publisher=Musicianguide.com |date= |accessdate=2 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two more Dire Straits albums were released, both live albums. ''[[On the Night]]'', released in May 1993, documented Dire Straits' final world tour. In 1995, following the release of ''[[Live at the BBC (Dire Straits album)|Live at the BBC]]'' (a contractual release to [[Vertigo Records]]), Mark Knopfler quietly dissolved Dire Straits and launched his career as a solo artist.

Since the break-up of Dire Straits, Knopfler has shown no interest in reforming the group. However, keyboardist Guy Fletcher has been associated with almost every piece of Knopfler's solo material to date, while Danny Cummings has also contributed frequently, playing on three of Knopfler's solo album releases ''[[All the Roadrunning]]'' (with [[Emmylou Harris]]), ''[[Kill to Get Crimson]]'', and ''[[Get Lucky (Mark Knopfler album)|Get Lucky]]''. In October 2008 Knopfler declined a suggestion by John Illsley that the band should reform. Illsley said that a reunion would be "entirely up to Mark"; however, he also observed that Knopfler was enjoying his success as a solo artist.&lt;ref name=oct2008/&gt; When asked about a possible reunion, Knopfler responded, "Oh, I don't know whether to start getting all that stuff back together again", and that the global fame Dire Straits achieved in the 1980s "just got too big".&lt;ref name=oct2008&gt;{{cite news|last=Youngs |first=Ian |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7656310.stm |title=Entertainment &amp;#124; Knopfler declines Straits reunion |work=BBC News |date=7 October 2008 |accessdate=1 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, the band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Nevertheless, Knopfler did not attend the induction ceremony, while Clark, Fletcher, and Illsley were in attendance to accept the award on behalf of the band.

==Solo career (since 1996)==
[[File:Mark Knopfler en Bilbao.jpg|thumb|Knopfler performing in Bilbao, 2001]]
Knopfler's first solo album, ''[[Golden Heart]]'', was released in March 1996. It featured the UK single "[[Darling Pretty]]". The album's recording sessions helped create Knopfler's backing band, which is also known as ''The 96ers''. It features Knopfler's old bandmate Guy Fletcher on keyboards. This band's main line-up has lasted much longer than any Dire Straits line-up. Also in 1996, Knopfler recorded guitar for Ted Christopher's [[Dunblane massacre]] tribute cover, ''[[Knockin' on Heaven's Door]]''.

In 1997, Knopfler recorded the soundtrack for the movie ''Wag the Dog''. During that same year ''Rolling Stone'' magazine listed ''Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll'', which included ''[[Sultans of Swing]]'', Dire Straits' first hit. 2000 saw the release of Knopfler's next solo album, ''[[Sailing to Philadelphia]].'' This has been his most successful to date, possibly helped by the number of notable contributors to the album, like [[Van Morrison]]. On 15 September 1997, Knopfler appeared at the ''[[Music for Montserrat]]'' concert at the [[Royal Albert Hall]], London, performing alongside artists such as [[Sting (musician)|Sting]], [[Phil Collins]], [[Elton John]], [[Eric Clapton]] and [[Paul McCartney]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BwoEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA59&amp;dq=Music+for+Montserrat+-+concert&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=lCrqUJ6JOuXb0QX_jICAAw&amp;ved=0CE0Q6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=Music%20for%20Montserrat%20-%20concert&amp;f=false|title=Billboard 6 September 1997|publisher=Books.google.com|accessdate=27 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, Knopfler gave four charity concerts with former Dire Straits members John Illsley, [[Chris White (saxophonist)|Chris White]], Danny Cummings and Guy Fletcher, playing old material from the Dire Straits years. The concerts also featured The Notting Hillbillies with Brendan Croker and Steve Phillips. At these four concerts (three of the four were at the Shepherd's Bush, the fourth at [[Beaulieu, Hampshire|Beaulieu]] on the south coast) they were joined by [[Jimmy Nail]], who provided backing vocals for Knopfler's 2002 composition ''[[Why Aye Man]]''.

Also in 2002, Knopfler released his third solo album, ''[[The Ragpicker's Dream]]''. In March 2003 he was involved in a motorbike crash in Grosvenor Road, Belgravia and suffered a broken collarbone, broken shoulder blade and seven broken ribs.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, H.

[[File:MarkKnopfler 060528 P5280036a jm.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Knopfler performing in Hamburg, 2006]]
''Shangri-La'' was recorded at the Shangri-La Studio in [[Malibu, California]], in 2004, where [[the Band]] had made recordings years before for their documentary/movie, ''[[The Last Waltz]].'' In the promo for ''Shangri-La'' on his official website, he said his current line-up of [[Glenn Worf]] (bass), Guy Fletcher (keyboards), [[Chad Cromwell]] (drums), [[Richard Bennett (guitarist)|Richard Bennett]] (guitar), and [[Matt Rollings]] (piano) "...play Dire Straits songs better than Dire Straits did." The ''Shangri-La'' tour took Knopfler to countries such as India and the United Arab Emirates for the first time. In India, his concerts at Mumbai and Bangalore were well received, with over 20,000 fans at each concert.

In November 2005 a compilation, ''[[Private Investigations (album)|Private Investigations: The Best of Dire Straits &amp; Mark Knopfler]]'' was released, consisting of material from most of Dire Straits' studio albums and Knopfler's solo and soundtrack material. The album was released in two editions, as a single CD (with a grey cover) and as a double CD (with the cover in blue), and was well received. The only previously unreleased track on the album is ''All the Roadrunning'', a duet with country music singer [[Emmylou Harris]], which was followed in 2006 by an album of duets of the same name.

Released in April 2006, ''[[All the Roadrunning]]'' reached No. 1 in Denmark and Switzerland, No. 2 in Norway and Sweden, No. 3 in Germany, The Netherlands and Italy, No. 8 in Austria and UK, No. 9 in Spain, No. 17 in the United States (''Billboard'' Top 200 Chart), No. 25 in Ireland, and No. 41 in Australia. ''All the Roadrunning'' was nominated for "Best Folk Rock/Americana Album" at the [[49th Grammy Awards]] (11 February 2007) but lost out to Bob Dylan's nomination for [[Modern Times (Bob Dylan album)|''Modern Times'']].

Joined by Emmylou Harris, Knopfler supported ''All the Roadrunning'' with a limited—15 concerts in Europe, 1 in Canada, and 8 in the United States—but highly successful tour of Europe and North America. Selections from the duo's performance of 28 June at the Gibson Amphitheatre, Universal City, California, were released as a DVD entitled ''[[Real Live Roadrunning]]'' on 14 November 2006. In addition to several of the compositions that Harris and Knopfler recorded together in the studio, ''Real Live Roadrunning'' features solo hits from both members of the duo, as well as three tracks from Knopfler's days with Dire Straits.

A charity event in 2007 went wrong: a Fender Stratocaster guitar signed by Knopfler, Clapton, [[Brian May]], and [[Jimmy Page]], which was to be auctioned for £20,000 to raise the money for a children's hospice, was lost when being shipped. It "...vanished after being posted from London to Leicestershire, England." [[Parcelforce]], the company responsible, agreed to pay £15,000 for its loss.&lt;ref name="bbc-post"&gt;{{cite news|title=Star-signed guitar lost in post |work=BBC |date=7 December 2007 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7132615.stm |accessdate=6 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PR"&gt;PR Inside.com (Retrieved 6 March 2008), [https://web.archive.org/web/20080315035944/http://www.pr-inside.com/entertainment-blog/2007/12/07/legends-guitar-lost-in-post/ Legend's guitar lost in post]&lt;/ref&gt;

Knopfler released his fifth solo studio-album ''[[Kill to Get Crimson]]'' on 14 September 2007 in Germany, 17 September in the UK and 18 September in the United States. During the autumn of 2007 he played a series of intimate 'showcases' in various European cities to promote the album. A tour of Europe and North America followed in 2008.

Continuing a pattern of high productivity through his solo career, Knopfler began work on his next studio album, entitled ''[[Get Lucky (Mark Knopfler album)|Get Lucky]]'', in September 2008 with long-time bandmate Guy Fletcher, who again compiled a pictorial diary of the making of the album on his website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guyfletcher.co.uk/index.php/diary/Get_Lucky_Studio_Diary_2009 |title=2007gfrdhome |publisher=Guyfletcher.co.uk |date=30 March 2009 |accessdate=24 September 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091002150932/http://guyfletcher.co.uk/index.php/diary/Get_Lucky_Studio_Diary_2009 |archivedate=2 October 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The album was released on 14 September the following year and Knopfler subsequently undertook an extensive tour across Europe and America. The album met with moderate success on the charts (much of it in Europe) reaching No. 1 only in Norway but peaking in the Top 5 in most major European countries (Germany, Italy, The Netherlands). The album peaked at No. 2 on the Billboard European Album chart and at No. 5 on the Billboard Rock Album chart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.markknopfler.com/news/news_items.aspx?PostID=14611|title=The Official Community of Mark Knopfler|publisher=Markknopfler.com|date=27 May 2009|accessdate=1 July 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090531154210/http://www.markknopfler.com/news/news_items.aspx?PostID=14611|archivedate=31 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mark Knopfler Zwolle 2013.jpg|thumb|left|Knopfler performing in Zwolle, Netherlands, 2013]]
Knopfler's solo live performances can be characterised as relaxed—almost workmanlike. He uses very little stage production, other than some lighting effects to enhance the music's dynamics. He has been known to sip tea on stage during live performances. [[Richard Bennett (guitarist)|Richard Bennett]], who has been playing with him on tour since 1996, has also joined in drinking tea with him on stage. On 31 July 2005, at the [[Queen Elizabeth Theatre]] in [[Vancouver|Vancouver, BC]], the tea was replaced with whisky as a "last show of tour" sort of joke.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=2005 Shangri-La Tour Diary |url=http://www.guyfletcher.co.uk/index.php/diary/2005_Shangri-La_Tour_Diary |publisher=Guy Fletcher Website |accessdate=15 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007151250/http://guyfletcher.co.uk/index.php/diary/2005_Shangri-La_Tour_Diary |archivedate=7 October 2011  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2009, Knopfler gave an intimate solo concert at the [[Garrick Club]] in London. Knopfler had recently become a member of the exclusive [[gentlemen's club]] for [[Man of letters|men of letters]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Deedes |first=Henry |title=Knopfler serenades Garrick chums |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/pandora/pandora-cable-is-plugged-in-for-stage-show-1624888.html |newspaper=The Independent |accessdate=15 October 2011 |location=London |date=18 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, Knopfler appeared on the newest [[Thomas Dolby]] release, the EP ''Amerikana''.

==Country music==
[[File:DSC08946 Mark Knopfler Emmylou Harris by Volkan Yuksel.JPG|thumb|Knopfler performing in Chicago with Emmylou Harris, 2006]]
In addition to his work in Dire Straits and solo, Knopfler has made several contributions to [[country music]]. In 1988 he formed country-focused band [[the Notting Hillbillies]],&lt;ref name="authorizedbiography"/&gt; with [[Guy Fletcher]], [[Brendan Croker]] and [[Steve Phillips (musician)|Steve Phillips]]. The Notting Hillbillies sole studio album, ''[[Missing...Presumed Having a Good Time]]'' was released in 1990 and featured the minor hit single "Your Own Sweet Way". Knopfler further emphasised his country music influences with his collaboration with [[Chet Atkins]], ''[[Neck and Neck]]'', which was also released in 1990. "[[Poor Boy Blues]]", taken from that collaboration, peaked at No. 92.

Knopfler's other contributions include writing and playing guitar on [[John Anderson (musician)|John Anderson]]'s 1992 single "[[When It Comes to You]]" (from his album ''[[Seminole Wind]]''). In 1993 [[Mary Chapin Carpenter]] also released a cover of the Dire Straits song ''[[The Bug (song)|The Bug]]''. [[Randy Travis]] released another of Knopfler's songs, "Are We in Trouble Now", in 1996. In that same year, Knopfler's solo single "[[Darling Pretty]]" reached a peak of No. 87.

Knopfler collaborated with [[George Jones]] on the 1994 ''[[The Bradley Barn Sessions]]'' album, performing guitar duties on the classic [[J.P. Richardson]] composition "[[White Lightning (George Jones song)|White Lightnin']]". He is featured on [[Kris Kristofferson]]'s album ''The Austin Sessions'', (on the track "Please Don't Tell Me How The Story Ends") released in 1999 by Atlantic Records.

In 2006, Knopfler and [[Emmylou Harris]] made a country album together titled ''[[All the Roadrunning]]'', followed by a live CD-DVD titled ''[[Real Live Roadrunning]]''. Knopfler also charted two singles on the Canadian country music singles chart. Again in 2006, Knopfler contributed the song "Whoop De Doo" to [[Jimmy Buffett]]'s [[Gulf and western (music genre)|Gulf and Western]] style album ''[[Take the Weather with You]]''. In 2013, he wrote and played guitar on the song "Oldest Surfer on the Beach" to Buffett's album ''[[Songs From St. Somewhere]]''.

==Personal life==
Knopfler has been married three times, first to Kathy White, his long-time girlfriend from school days. They separated before Knopfler moved to London to join Brewers Droop in 1973.&lt;ref name="authorizedbiography"/&gt; Knopfler's second marriage in November 1983 to Lourdes Salomone produced twin sons, who were born in 1987.&lt;ref name="knopfler1"/&gt; Their marriage ended in 1993.&lt;ref name="musicianguide2"/&gt; On [[Valentine's Day]] 1997 in [[Barbados]], Knopfler married British actress and writer [[Kitty Aldridge]], whom he had known for three years.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, M. (1997) ''The Mirror'', London, England. Available from: [http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-61105962.html "Mark Ties the Knot-fler Again; TV Kitty Is Wife No 3 in Paradise Wedding"]. Retrieved 15 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; They have two daughters.&lt;ref name="authorizedbiography"/&gt;

Knopfler is a fan of his local football club [[Newcastle United F.C.]].&lt;ref name="Newcastle"&gt;Anthony Bateman (2008). "Sporting Sounds: Relationships Between Sport and Music". p. 186. Routledge&lt;/ref&gt; "Going Home (Theme of the Local Hero)" is used by Newcastle United as an anthem at home games.

He has a collection of classic cars which he races and exhibits at shows, including a [[Maserati 300S]] and an [[Austin-Healey 100S]].&lt;ref name="speedvision-mk"&gt;{{cite video|people= |title=A Performer's Passion: Mark Knopfler, Racer |medium=Documentary |publisher=Speedvision |location=London |date=2006 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ze6Cn4Lc3Gw }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="healeysport"&gt;{{cite web |title=Le Mans Classic |work=Healey Sport |year=2006 |url=http://www.healeysport.org/Raceintl_homepage.htm |accessdate=25 November 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120904200759/http://www.healeysport.org/Raceintl_homepage.htm |archivedate=4 September 2012  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Herman Meyer Bosman''' (born 19 April 1985 in [[Bethlehem, Free State]], South Africa) is a former South African rugby player, who last played for the [[Stade Français]], in France. He is a flyhalf (10), but has recently showed great ability in the inside-center position. He has played for the national team of South Africa, the [[Springboks]] on 3 occasions in test matches between 2005 and 2006. He played his last test to date{{when|date=June 2014}} on 15 July 2006 against {{nrut|Australia}} in Brisbane.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} Throughout his career, Bosman won three [[Currie Cup]] trophies, two outright and drawing another in [[2006 Currie Cup Premier Division|2006]], also finishing as runner-up twice with the Sharks.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

==Rugby career==

===Cheetahs / Free State Cheetahs===

Bosman started his professional rugby career at the {{Rut Free State Cheetahs}} in 2005. During [[2005 Currie Cup Premier Division|his first season]], he scored the winning try in the dying moments of the Currie Cup final against the {{Rut Blue Bulls}} in [[Pretoria]] to earn his side a 29–25 victory.&lt;ref name="Vodacom Blue Bulls 25-29 Vodacom Cheetahs"&gt;{{SA Rugby Match Centre | id=12193 | homeid=5512 | awayid=5515 | leagueid=381 | hometeam=Vodacom Blue Bulls | homescore=25 | awayscore=29 | awayteam=Vodacom Cheetahs | matchdate=22 October 2005 | date=21 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The result meant the [[Free State Cheetahs]] won only their second [[Currie Cup]] championship, the first being more than 30 years previously.

Bosman was part of the team that successfully defended the title for the following two years, the final ending in a 28-28 draw in 2006 against {{Rut Blue Bulls}}&lt;ref name="Vodacom Free State Cheetahs 28-28 Vodacom Blue Bulls"&gt;{{SA Rugby Match Centre | id=13418 | homeid=5913 | awayid=5914 | leagueid=414 | hometeam=Vodacom Free State Cheetahs | homescore=28 | awayscore=28 | awayteam=Vodacom Blue Bulls | matchdate=14 October 2006 | date=21 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then defeating the [[Golden Lions]] 20–18 in the [[2007 Currie Cup Premier Division|2007]] final.&lt;ref name="Vodacom Free State Cheetahs 20-18 Golden Lions"&gt;{{SA Rugby Match Centre | id=14993 | homeid=6294 | awayid=6293 | leagueid=588 | hometeam=Vodacom Free State Cheetahs | homescore=20 | awayscore=18 | awayteam=Golden Lions | matchdate=27 October 2007 | date=21 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006 the {{Rut Cheetahs}} entered the [[Super Rugby|Super 14]] as the new South African franchise. At the time of his departure, Bosman held Cheetahs Super Rugby records for career appearances (61), most career points (188), most points in a Super Rugby match (26) and most penalty goals in a Super Rugby match (8).{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

===Springboks===

At the young age of 20, he made his debut for the Boks in late 2005, against Wales in [[Cardiff]]. The Boks won the game 33–16, with Bosman contributed two conversions on his debut. He played the next week against France in [[Paris]], again starting at flyhalf. He kicked one penalty goal in the 20–26 loss. After the [[Cheetahs]] [[Super 14]] season in 2006 ended, Bosman was called up for the Boks for the Tri Nations, and was a reserve in the 0–49 loss in [[Brisbane]] against the Wallabies. In 2010, Bosman was an unused substitution in the Springboks 34-31 victory over {{nrut|Wales}} in [[Cardiff]].

===Sharks / Sharks===

At the end of the 2010 Currie Cup season, Bosman signed with the {{Rut Sharks (Currie Cup)}}, the [[2010 Currie Cup Premier Division|2010 Currie Cup]] champions. He made his debut for the {{Rut Sharks}} [[Super Rugby]] side against his former team, the {{Rut Cheetahs}}, in the Super Rugby competition on 19 February 2011 playing at inside centre. The former Sharks inside center, [[Andries Strauss]], played in that match for the {{Rut Cheetahs}}, the two players effectively swapping the number 12 jerseys for the two teams. Bosman was a regular starter for the {{Rut Sharks (Currie Cup)}} throughout his career as he helped steer the coastal side to two consecutive [[Currie Cup]] finals (in [[2011 Currie Cup Premier Division|2011]] and [[2012 Currie Cup Premier Division|2012]]) and a [[Super Rugby]] qualifier ([[2011 Super Rugby season|2011]]) and final ([[2012 Super Rugby season|2012]]). However, Bosman never managed to win a title with the side.

===Stade Francais===

In 2013, [[Stade Français]] announced that he was joining them on a two-year contract.&lt;ref name="Meyer Bosman à Paris pour deux saisons"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.stade.fr/actualite/article/view/9237 | title=Meyer Bosman à Paris pour deux saisons | work=Stade Français | date=13 June 2013 | accessdate=13 June 2013 | language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Naftuli Moster''' (born 1986) is an American social activist. He is the founder and executive director of [[YAFFED]] (Young Advocates for Fair Education). Established in 2011, YAFFED is an advocacy organization dedicated to ensuring that students at Hasidic non-public school in [[New York City]] will receive a full education as required by law. In recognition of the impact of his social activism, ''[[The Forward]]'' named Moster in 2015 one of the "[[Forward 50]]", [[American Jews]] who provide leadership in the Jewish community.&lt;ref&gt;[http://forward.com/series/forward-50/2015/naftuli-moster/ Forward 50: Loud, Proud, And at The Heart of America: Naftuli Moster] The Forward, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/23/nyregion/a-yeshiva-graduate-fights-for-secular-studies-in-hasidic-education.html A Yeshiva Graduate Fights for Secular Studies in Hasidic Education] New York Times (Nov 21, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Moster grew up in [[Borough Park, Brooklyn]], one of 17 children in an [[ultra-Orthodox]] [[Jewish]] family. [[Yiddish]] was his first language, and he speaks with a slight Yiddish accent. He attended a [[Belz (Hasidic dynasty)|Belz]] [[yeshiva]] where secular studies were limited.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nymag.com/nymag/features/east-ramapo-hasidim-2013-4/index3.html Them and Them] New York Magazine, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; After studying in Israel, he attended [[Touro College]], then [[City University of New York]]'s [[College of Staten Island]]. He earned a [[Master of Social Work]] degree at the Silberman School of Social Work at [[Hunter College]] in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sssw.hunter.cuny.edu/ssw/silberman-student-works-reform-hasidic-education/ SILBERMAN STUDENT WORKS TO REFORM HASIDIC EDUCATION] Hunter College School of Social Work, December 3, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; He has an interest in [[psychology]], inspired by a visiting Israeli scholar.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/23/nyregion/a-yeshiva-graduate-fights-for-secular-studies-in-hasidic-education.html Yiddish Isn’t Enough:A Yeshiva Graduate Fights for Secular Studies in Hasidic Education] (Nov 21, 2014) The New York Times, Nov 21, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;
His education in his yeshiva was focused on religious studies. After completing his yeshiva studies, he wanted to apply to college, but did not know what a "[[high school diploma]]" was, and did not know what it meant to write an "[[essay]]". He was a senior in college when he first heard the word "[[molecule]]", and remembers how embarrassing it was to be the only one in class who did not recognize the word.&lt;ref name=nytimes&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually, Moster filed for a "dependency override" from his family so that he would be eligible for financial aid to attend college. He acknowledges that doing so leaves his community feeling he has gone "[[off the derech]]," a path that leaves him a "disgrace" in their eyes. However, his struggles with his own lack of education in secular subjects inspired him later to take action to help other similar students.&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Miller|first1=Jennifer|title=Yiddish Isn’t Enough:A Yeshiva Graduate Fights for Secular Studies in Hasidic Education|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/23/nyregion/a-yeshiva-graduate-fights-for-secular-studies-in-hasidic-education.html|accessdate=12 March 2018|date=November 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Moster's first employment included work as a warehouse manager for Royal Bag from 2008 to 2012. He also worked as an intern in social work from 2014 to 2015 at FEGS, a non-profit health and human services agency.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

While studying for his degree in social work, Moster founded [[YAFFED]]. He served as President of the organization from 2012-2016, and is currently Executive Director. Concerned that many other students in the ultra-Orthodox community might struggle as he did in trying to apply to college and learn skills that would enable him to make a living,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wnet/religionandethics/2016/01/29/january-29-2016-ultra-orthodox-yeshiva-controversy/28831/ Ultra-Orthodox Yeshiva Controversy] PBS, January 29, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Moster founded the non-profit organization with the aim of ensuring that ultra-Orthodox students in private school receive the secular education mandated by the State of New York. Public education organizations and staff are often unaware of their responsibilities to students at private and religious schools. Moster discussed the problem of secular education with New York superintendents who have large Hasidic communities in their district. Through YAFFED, Moster is also hoping to raise the awareness of ultra-Orthodox educational needs in the Jewish community. The mission is to ensure all students acquire the knowledge and skills necessary to earn a livelihood and to allow personal growth.&lt;ref&gt;"YAFFED: About Us"http://yaffed.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nytimes&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with ''[[The Jewish Daily Forward]]'', Moster noted that his approach to community organizing is not the traditional one. His style is "to get to those people who do believe in education, and enable them to speak up and ask their leaders to make some changes so their children can have a better future."&lt;ref&gt;[http://forward.com/articles/178624/getting-in-face-of-ultra-orthodox-on-need-for-real/ Brenner, Yermi "Getting In Face of Ultra-Orthodox on Need for Real World Education: Preaching Value of Skills in World Where Talmud Is King" (June 19, 2013) ''The Jewish Daily Forward''.]&lt;/ref&gt; When publications in the insular community refused to publish information, Moster is willing to take a more direct approach, pursuing letter writing campaigns and direct billboards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/Diaspora/New-York-to-investigate-haredi-schools-for-lack-of-secular-studies-410505 New York to investigate Haredi schools for lack of secular studies] [[The Jerusalem Post]], July 29, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Moster is also engaged as a [[public speaker]] on radio and at public events such as [[Limmud]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://limmudny2016.sched.org/speaker/naftuli_moster.1ulcwxxr Speaker Naftuli Moster] Limmud, Feb 14, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nahum Nir-Rafalkes''' ({{lang-he|נחום ניר}}, 17 March 1884 &amp;ndash; 10 July 1968) was a [[Zionism|Zionist]] activist, [[Israel]]i politician and one of the signatories of the [[Declaration of Independence (Israel)|Israeli declaration of independence]]. He is the only [[List of Knesset speakers|Speaker of the Knesset]] not to have been a member of the ruling party.

==Biography==
Nahum Rafalkes (later Nir-Rafalkes) was born in [[Warsaw]], then part of the [[Russian Empire]]. He studied at a [[Heder]] in the city before studying natural sciences at university in Warsaw, Zurich and St Petersburg. He also studied law at St Petersburg and Dorfat, gaining a [[Doctor of Laws|LL.D]] in 1908.

In 1903, he joined the Zionist student's organisation Kadima, and was a delegate to the sixth Zionist congress that year. Two years later he joined [[Poale Zion]], and was also involved in the founding of World Poale Zion. Nir also served as head of the Polish Waiter's Union, and in 1906 led what he claimed to be the world's first successful strike against tipping.&lt;ref name="TIME"&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,936995,00.html?promoid=googlep Call for Reinforcements] TIME, 16 March 1959&lt;/ref&gt; That year he was sent to prison for political activities, but still attended the seventh Zionist congress the following year. In 1919 he was elected to [[Warsaw City Council]].

He was offered the position of Commissar for Jewish Affairs but turned it down after consultation with the Central Committee of Poale Zion.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.il/books?id=0EjI5CvKH94C&amp;pg=PA48&amp;lpg=PA48&amp;dq=nahum+nir+rafalkes&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=nQimuIvlaj&amp;sig=6-YUcFsDCknPToVdtP4r_tq0XSY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=bS2aVYq1FIT7UOqHp5gD&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=nahum%20nir%20rafalkes&amp;f=false) National Communism in the Soviet Union, 1918-28, Baruch Gurevitz]&lt;/ref&gt;

When Poale Zion split, Nir joined the left-wing faction. He served as secretary of the Left World Union of Poale Zion, and was involved in negotiations to allow it to join [[Comintern]]. In 1925 he [[Aliyah|immigrated]] to [[Mandatory Palestine|Mandate Palestine]] and worked as a lawyer. In February 1948, he was elected head of the Economic Control Office.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.il/books?id=qf6AAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA69&amp;lpg=PA69&amp;dq=nahum+nir-rafalkes&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Xo3WVB0PXo&amp;sig=PMAINzc8KsTih_YSB7lgUqc4HXo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=HNabVdjVCsnfU66onbgL&amp;ved=0CBsQ6AEwADgK#v=onepage&amp;q=nahum%20nir-rafalkes&amp;f=true Social Mobilization in the Arab/Israeli War of 1948: On the Israeli Home Front, Moshe Naor]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political career==
Nir Rafalkes continued to play a prominent role in [[Poale Zion]] and was a member of the [[Jewish National Council]] and the [[Assembly of Representatives (Mandate Palestine)|Assembly of Representatives]] prior to independence. A member of [[Provisional State Council|Moetzet HaAm]] (later the [[Provisional State Council]]), Nir signed the Israeli declaration of independence in 1948. That same year, his party merged with [[Mapam]] and Nir was elected to the [[Israeli legislative election, 1949|First Knesset]] in 1949. He served as Deputy Speaker of the Knesset and chaired the Constitution, Law and Justice Committee.

Nir lost his seat in the [[Israeli legislative election, 1951|1951 elections]]. In 1954, [[Ahdut HaAvoda]] (a faction related to the Left Poale Zion) broke away from Mapam, and Nir assumed membership of the new party. He was returned to the Knesset on its list, when [[Tzipora Laskov]] resigned from her seat on October 1955, and again chaired the Constitution, Law and Justice Committee.

He was initially re-appointed Deputy Speaker of the Knesset, but following the death of the incumbent [[Yosef Sprinzak]] in  January 1959, Nir stood in the election for a new speaker against a [[Mapai]] (Ben-Gurion's party) candidate. Nir won the election due to the support of the right-wing opposition and several minor left-wing parties,&lt;ref name="TIME" /&gt; marking the only time to date in which a candidate not from the ruling party has been elected Speaker.

Nir retained his seat in the [[Israeli legislative election, 1959|November 1959 elections]], and chaired the committee for public services, but resumed his position as  Deputy Speaker when the Knesset reconvened. After being re-elected in 1961 he served again as Deputy speaker and chairman of the committee for public services. He lost his seat in the [[Israeli legislative election, 1965|1965 elections]].

'''Orestes Augustus Brownson''' (September 16, 1803 – April 17, 1876) was a [[New England]] [[intellectual]] and activist, preacher, labor organizer, and noted Catholic convert and writer. Brownson was a [[publicist]], a career which spanned his affiliation with the New England [[Transcendentalist]]s through his subsequent conversion to Roman Catholicism.

==Early years and education==
Brownson was born on September 16, 1803 to Sylvester Augustus Brownson and Relief Metcalf, who were farmers in [[Stockbridge, Vermont]]. Sylvester Brownson died when Orestes was young and Relief decided to give her son up to a nearby adoptive family when he was six years old. The family raised him under the strict confines of Calvinist [[Congregational church|Congregationalism]] on a small farm in [[Royalton, Vermont]]. He did not receive much schooling but he immensely enjoyed reading books.  Among these were volumes by [[Homer]] and [[John Locke|Locke]] and the Bible.&lt;ref&gt;[[Theodore Maynard|Maynard, Theodore]] (1943). ''Orestes Brownson:  Yankee, Radical, Catholic''. New York:  Macmillan, pp. 2–9.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1817, when he was fourteen, Orestes attended an academy briefly in New York.  This was the extent of his formal education.&lt;ref&gt;Hoeveler, David (2000). "Brownson, Orestes Augustus", American National Biography Online.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious unease==
In 1822, Brownson was baptized in the [[Presbyterian]] Church in [[Ballston, New York]] but he quickly complained that Presbyterians only associated with themselves, and that the [[Reformed theology|Reformed]] doctrines of [[predestination]] and [[eternal sin]] were too harsh. After withdrawing from Presbyterianism in 1824 and teaching at various schools in upstate New York and Detroit, Brownson applied to be a [[Universalist]] preacher. [[Universalism]], for Brownson, represented the only liberal variety of Christianity he knew of. However, [[Universalism]] also failed to quell his desire for religious understanding. He became the editor of a Universalist journal, ''Gospel Advocate and Impartial Investigator'' in which he wrote about his own religious doubt and criticized organized faiths and [[mysticism]] in religion.&lt;ref&gt;[[Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr.|Schlesinger, Jr., Arthur M.]] (1963). ''Orestes A. Brownson:  A Pilgrim's Progress''. New York: Octagon Books, pp. 6–10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, rejecting Universalism, he became associated with [[Robert Dale Owen]] and [[Fanny Wright]] in New York City and supported the [[Workingmen's Party of New York]].&lt;ref&gt;Hecker, I.T. (1887). [http://quod.lib.umich.edu/m/moajrnl/bac8387.0045.266/204:7?rgn=full+text;view=image "Dr. Brownson and the Workingman's Party Fifty Years Ago,"] ''The Catholic World'', Vol. 45, No. 266, pp. 200–08.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1831, he moved to [[Ithaca, New York]], where he became the pastor of a Unitarian community. There, he began publishing the magazine the ''Philanthropist''. In it, he could express his ideas outside of the pulpit since he thought of himself as a better journalist than preacher.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

==Transcendentalism==

[[File:Portrait of Orestes Augustus Brownson.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Orestes Brownson.]]
After the demise of the ''Philanthropist'' in 1832, Brownson moved to [[Walpole, New Hampshire]] where he was a part of the [[Transcendentalist]] movement which swept through the Boston Unitarian community.&lt;ref&gt;Caponigri, A. Robert (1945). "Brownson and Emerson: Nature and History", ''The New England Quarterly'', Vol. 18, No. 3, pp. 368–90.&lt;!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; He read in English Romanticism and English and French reports on German Idealist philosophy, and was passionate about the work of [[Victor Cousin]] and [[Pierre Leroux]]. In 1836, the same year that [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]]'s  ''Nature'' was published, Brownson participated in the founding of the [[Transcendental Club]].

In the same year he moved to [[Chelsea, Massachusetts]] to set up his own church which he called "The Society for Christian Union and Progress" and published his first book, ''New Views of Christianity, Society, and the Church.''  This work combined Transcendentalist religious views with radical social egalitarianism, sharply criticizing the unequal social distribution of wealth as un-Christian and unprincipled. After President [[Martin Van Buren]] appointed [[George Bancroft]] as Collector of Customs at Boston in 1837, Bancroft in turn gave jobs to Brownson and  [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]].

In 1838, he founded the ''Boston Quarterly Review'', and served as its editor and main contributor for four years. Other contributors included [[George Bancroft]], [[Margaret Fuller]], [[George Ripley (transcendentalist)|George Ripley]], and [[Elizabeth Peabody]].&lt;ref name=Lewis185&gt;Lewis, R. W. B. (1955). ''The American Adam: Innocence, Tragedy, and Tradition in the Nineteenth Century''. Chicago: The University of Chicago Press, p. 185.&lt;/ref&gt; Brownson originally offered use of the ''Boston Quarterly Review'' as a literary vehicle for the Transcendentalists; they declined and instead created ''[[The Dial]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Von Mehren, Joan (1994). ''Minerva and the Muse: A Life of Margaret Fuller''. Amherst, Massachusetts: [[University of Massachusetts Press]], p. 120. {{ISBN|1-55849-015-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brownson's essays were political, intellectual, and religious. Among these was a favourable review of [[Thomas Carlyle|Thomas Carlyle's]] ''Chartism'', separately published as ''The Laboring Classes'' (1840), which caused considerable controversy. The article and Brownson's review of it is sometimes blamed for causing Van Buren, whom Brownson avidly supported, to lose the 1840 election to [[William Henry Harrison]].&lt;ref&gt;Schlesinger (1963), pp. 44–90.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, Van Buren himself is said to have "blamed [Brownson] as the main cause of his defeat" because ''The Boston Quarterly Review'' had recently promoted socialist ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Brownson, Henry (1908). Orestes Augustus Brownson. The Catholic Encyclopedia&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1840 Brownson published his semi-autobiographical work, ''Charles Elwood; Or, The Infidel Converted''. Through the protagonist, Brownson railed against organized religion and questioned the Bible's infallibility, or truthfulness. In 1842, Brownson ceased separate publication of the ''Boston Quarterly Review'', and it was merged into ''The United States Magazine and Democratic Review'', but his beliefs were once again evolving, and he found it necessary to break with the ''Review'' after a series of his essays created new scandal.

===Conversion to Catholicism===
In the spring of 1843, rumors spread that Brownson was considering converting to Catholicism, especially when he met with the Roman Catholic Bishop of Boston.&lt;ref name=Packer171&gt;Packer, Barbara L. (2007) ''The Transcendentalists''. Athens, Georgia: The University of Georgia Press, pg. 171; {{ISBN|978-0-8203-2958-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; He finally converted on October 20, 1844,&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, R.W.B. (1955). ''The American Adam: Innocence, Tragedy, and Tradition in the Nineteenth Century''. Chicago: The University of Chicago Press, p. 184.&lt;!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; his religion for the rest of his life. He began to believe, in contrast to his Transcendentalist colleagues, in the inherent sinfulness of humanity.&lt;ref&gt;Grocholoski, Krystyna (1999) Orestes Brownson. American Transcendentalism Web.&lt;/ref&gt; Further, he began to associate Protestantism with capitalist notions he despised.&lt;ref&gt;Hoeveler David. (2000) "Brownson, Orestes Augustus", in American National Biography Online.&lt;/ref&gt; 

He soon renounced the errors of his past including [[Transcendentalism]] and liberalism, and devoted himself to writing articles dedicated to converting America to Catholicism. Brownson used his articles to strike out against his former friends in the Transcendental movement, whom, he wrote, would be damned unless they converted as well.&lt;ref name=Packer171/&gt; He succeeded in persuading [[Sophia Ripley]], wife of George Ripley, to convert, but few others. At the same time, he lost the respect of more of his correspondents. According to one scholar, after his conversion, Brownson's writing changed, and the work he published in ''Brownson's Quarterly Review'' expressed ''"''liberal views [that] frequently got Brownson into trouble, sometimes with the Catholic hierarchy."&lt;REF NAME="THORP"/&gt; His conversion prompted him to be overzealous in defense of the Catholic Church. His unruly enthusiasm resulted in letters from local Catholic journalists and even the bishop of his diocese requesting that he cease leveling such harsh criticisms.&lt;ref&gt;Schlesinger (1963), pp. 200–10.&lt;/ref&gt; Brownson's stance had much in common with the [[Liberal Catholicism]] of [[Charles de Montalembert]], with whom he corresponded, and he published articles in French liberal Catholic publications such as ''Le Correspondant'', taking the side of the liberals against the conservative Catholics such as [[Louis Veuillot]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Longley |first1=Max |title=For the Union and the Catholic Church: Four Converts in the Civil War |date=2015 |publisher=McFarland |pages=85-87}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Carey |first1=Patrick W. |title=Orestes Brownson and the Civil War |journal=U.S. Catholic Historian |date=2013 |volume=31 |issue=1 |pages=1-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brownson had also been writing many articles for the [[Paulist Fathers]] ''[[Catholic World]]'' publication. Brownson now saw Catholicism as the only religion that could restrain the undisciplined American citizens and thus ensure the success of democracy. To him, the United States was to be a model to the world, and the ideal model was a Catholic America. He repudiated his earlier [[Charles Fourier|Fourierist]] and [[Robert Owen|Owenite]] ideas, now criticizing socialism and [[utopianism]] as vigorously as he had once promoted them. A staunch [[Douglas Democrat]], Brownson, like [[Stephen A. Douglas|Douglas]], supported the [[United States|Union]] in the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] and polemicized against the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] and against Catholic clergy who endorsed [[secession]]. He avidly supported [[abolitionism in the United States|emancipation]] and even made several trips to Washington to discuss the importance and urgency of emancipation with [[Abraham Lincoln|President Lincoln]]. He encouraged all Americans, especially Catholics, to be patriots in the country’s time of turmoil.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archives.nd.edu/findaids/ead/index/BRO002.htm "Notre Dame Archives Index BRO002"], archives.nd.edu; accessed April 23, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

After his conversion, he revived his former publication, now renamed ''Brownson's Quarterly Review'', in 1844.&lt;ref name=Lewis185/&gt; From 1844-64, Brownson maintained the ''Review'' as a Catholic journal of opinion, including many reviews of "inspirational novels" meant to encourage Catholic belief.&lt;REF NAME="THORP"&gt;Thorp, Willard (1978). ''Catholic Novelists in Defense of Their Faith, 1829-1865''. New York: Arno Press, A New York Times Company. A single volume in the complete set ''The American Catholic Tradition''; {{ISBN|0-405-10862-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1853, he wrote a series of articles that claimed that the Church was supreme over the State. These writings caused a controversy among Catholic immigrants and the entire Catholic community in general. This controversy caused bishops all over New England to begin condemning his writings. He became increasingly lonely as a result of his being shunned from Boston communities, so he moved the Review and his family to New York in 1855, where he revived his interest in Catholic political philosophy.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

In 1860, he announced that the Catholic Church must progress towards a welcoming intellectual environment.  He argued forcefully and eloquently that "neither the friends nor the enemies of religion have anything to fear from adopting the great principle of civil and religious liberty, and asserting a free Church in a free State."&lt;ref&gt;Orestes Brownson, Civil and Religious Freedom from ''Seeking the Truth'', ''LOGOS: A Journal of Catholic Thought and Culture'', 20:4 (Fall 2017) pp. 124–62, here 158.&lt;/ref&gt; Brownson noted with dismay how few European Catholics supported abolition, and applauded liberal Catholics like Montalembert for being "the only Catholics in Europe who sympathize with the loyal people of the Union."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Rosenblatt |first1=Helena |title=The Lost History of Liberalism: From Ancient Rome to the Twenty-First Century |date=2018 |publisher=Princeton University Press |page=174}}&lt;/ref&gt; He posited that conscience must remain free to believe as it decides and religion regards the spiritual not the civil realm. The State should protect such a right and restrict itself to governance of the external realm. He thus adopted a new form of liberalism that remained with him until his death,&lt;ref&gt;Maynard (1943), pp. 281–311.&lt;/ref&gt; although his enthusiasm for such a liberalism must be balanced by a near simultaneous and unambiguous repudiation of liberalism which he expressed in the resuscitated Quarterly Review in 1873.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=jrvPAAAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false "Brownson's Quarterly Review]''", Last Series, Vol. 1, January 1873, p. 2. (Pustet, New York, 1873).&lt;/ref&gt; There he rejected the kind of liberalism that makes "this world and its interests supreme." In 1862, he was nominated for a Republican Congressional spot in third district of New Jersey but was met with failure that was blamed on his open Catholic views.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} 

In 1864, [[John Frémont]], whom Brownson strongly supported, withdrew from the Presidential race. After these two defeats, Brownson’s declining health, spirit, and subscribers caused him to stop publishing the ''Review'' the same year. The journal was relaunched again later in Brownson's life after a nearly ten-year hiatus, in 1873. The ''Review'' finally ceased publication in 1875, the year before Brownson's death. In 1857, Brownson wrote a memoir, ''The Convert; or, Leaves from My Experience''.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

==Death==
Brownson died on April 17, 1876 in Detroit, aged 72.&lt;ref&gt;"Notre Dame Archives Index BRO002" http://archives.nd.edu/findaids/ead/index/BRO002.htm.&lt;/ref&gt; His remains were subsequently transferred to the crypt of the [[Basilica of the Sacred Heart, Notre Dame|Basilica of the Sacred Heart]] at the [[University of Notre Dame]], where his personal papers are also archived.

==Legacy and criticism==

Response to Orestes Brownson's views was mixed during his lifetime, but not entirely negative. He invited to New Orleans in 1855 by the publication ''Le Propagateur'' because he was viewed as a figure who both Protestants and Catholics could enjoy listening to, due to his multiple political and religious associations over the course of his lifetime. Various newspapers recorded contradictory opinions on his lectures, however, all praised his "eloquent" speech.&lt;ref&gt;LeBreton, Dagmar Renshaw. (1944) Orestes Brownson's visit to New Orleans in 1855. American Literature. 16 (2) (May): 110-4. p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1850s, among his many intellectual contributions, in the midst of Irish and German immigration debate and related [[Know Nothing#Underlying issues|nativist moral panic]], Brownson introduced the term ''Americanization'' into the public discourse while delivering a lecture, "Church and the Republic" at St. John’s College, future [[Fordham University]].&lt;ref&gt;Elteren, Mel van. [https://books.google.com/books?id=hwUyBgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA52&amp;ots=3udA92y2N9&amp;dq=Orestes%20Brownson%20about%20Americanization%20process&amp;pg=PA52#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Americanism and Americanization: A Critical History of Domestic and Global Influence'']. Jefferson, N.C.: McFarland &amp; Co, 2006, p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Verel. [https://news.fordham.edu/faith-and-service/professor-explains-roots-of-church-laity-conflict-in-old-new-york/ Professor Explains Roots of Church-Laity Conflict in Old New York], ''The Fordham University News'', May 23, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; His attempts to harmonize ethnic immigrant identities with American democratic tradition without social and cultural homogenization are considered as an early move in the direction of multiculturalism.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory S. Butler. [http://www.crisismagazine.com/1996/orestes-brownson-and-american-nativism Orestes Brownson and American Nativism], ''Crisis Magazine'', April 1, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; Brownson is often incorrectly credited with being the person to coin the term [[Odinism]], referring to his 1848 "Letter to Protestants".&lt;ref&gt;His use of "Odinism" can be found in ''[https://books.google.com/books?vid=OCLC04620476&amp;id=j0OqLx9h9UEC&amp;pg=RA2-PA257 The Works of Orestes Brownson]'', Vol. V (Detroit, 1885), pp. 256–257.&lt;/ref&gt; {{Citation needed|reason=the existing citation does not show that Odinism is incorrectly attributed to Brownson|date=May 2014}}

Brownson was summed up by poet and critic [[James Russell Lowell]] in his [[satire|satirical]] ''[[A Fable for Critics]]'' as someone trying to bite off more than he could chew: "his mouth very full with attempting to gulp a [[Papal bull|Gregorian bull]]".&lt;ref&gt;Duberman, Martin (1966). ''James Russell Lowell''. Boston: Houghton Mifflin Company, p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Edgar Allan Poe]] refers to Brownson in his ''Autography'' series, calling him "an extraordinary man," though he "has not altogether succeeded in convincing himself of those important truths which he is so anxious to impress upon his readers."&lt;ref name=Sova37&gt;Sova, Dawn B. (2001). ''Edgar Allan Poe: A to Z''. New York: Checkmark Books, p. 37 {{ISBN|0-8160-4161-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also mentioned in Poe's story "Mesmeric Revelation," referring to Brownson's 1840 novel ''Charles Eldwood; or, The Infidel Converted''.&lt;ref name=Sova37/&gt;

While reviewing Brownson's biography penned by [[Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr.]], [[Henry Steele Commager]] noted that, "in his day Orestes Brownson was respected and feared as were few of his contemporaries; European philosophers regarded him with hope; American politicians enlisted his vitriolic pen; denominations competed for his eloquence; and when he listed himself among the three most profound men in America there were those who took him seriously."&lt;ref&gt;Henry Steele Commager. [https://www.nytimes.com/books/00/11/26/specials/schlesinger-brownson.html?mcubz=1 That Sturdy but Erratic Reformer, Orestes Brownson], ''The New York Times - Books'', April 23, 1939.&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, Brownson was held in high regard by many European intellectuals and theologians, including [[Auguste Joseph Alphonse Gratry]], who called Brownson "the keenest critic of the 19th century, an indomitable logician, a disinterested lover of truth, a sage, as sharp as Aristotle, as lofty as Plato."&lt;ref&gt;Maurer, Armand. 1992. Orestes Brownson and Christian Philosophy. The Monist 75 (3, Christian Philosophy) (JULY): 341-53, at page 342.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
Orestes's brother, '''Oran Brownson''', joined [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] about the same time Orestes became a Roman Catholic. One of Oran's main reasons for joining the LDS Church was its belief in authority.&lt;ref&gt;[[Matthew J. Grow|Grow, Matthew J.]] (2004). "The Whore of Babylon and the Abomination of Abominations: Nineteenth-Century Catholic and Mormon Mutual Perceptions and Religious Identity," ''Church History'' '''73''', pp. 139–67.&lt;/ref&gt; Brownson's son Henry F. Brownson published a three-volume biography of his father in 1900 and edited his collected works.

'''''Prince Valiant in the Days of King Arthur''''', or simply '''''Prince Valiant''''', is an American [[comic strip]] created by [[Hal Foster]] in 1937. It is an epic adventure that has told a continuous story during its entire history, and the full stretch of that story now totals more than 4000 [[Sunday strip]]s. Currently, the strip appears weekly in more than 300 American newspapers, according to its distributor, [[King Features Syndicate]].

[[Edward VIII|Edward]], the [[Duke of Windsor]], called ''Prince Valiant'' the "greatest contribution to English literature in the past hundred years".&lt;ref name=syracuse&gt;[http://library.syr.edu/digital/guides/f/foster_hr.htm#fola Syracuse University: Hal Foster Papers.]&lt;/ref&gt; Generally regarded by comics historians as one of the most impressive visual creations ever syndicated, the strip is noted for its realistically rendered panoramas and the intelligent, sometimes humorous, narrative.&lt;ref&gt;"Beautifully drawn, the strip was an exciting re-creation of the period, rich with carefully researched details of armor, dwellings, and scenery.', Encyclopædia Britannica&lt;/ref&gt; The format does not employ [[word balloon]]s. Instead, the story is narrated in captions positioned at the bottom or sides of panels. Events depicted are taken from various time periods, from the late [[Roman Empire]] to the [[High Middle Ages]], with a few brief scenes from modern times (commenting on the "manuscript").&lt;ref name=companion&gt;Goldberg, Todd and Carl Horak, edited by [[Don Markstein]] and [[Rick Norwood]]. ''A Prince Valiant Companion''. [[Manuscript Press]]. {{ISBN|0-936414-07-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While drawing the ''[[Tarzan (comics)|Tarzan]]'' comic strip, Foster wanted to do his own original newspaper feature, and he began work on a strip he called '''''Derek, Son of Thane''''', later changing the title to '''''Prince Arn'''''. King Features manager Joseph Connelly eventually renamed it ''Prince Valiant''. In 1936, after extensive research, Foster pitched his concept to [[William Randolph Hearst]], who had long wanted to distribute a strip by Foster. Hearst was so impressed that he gave Foster ownership of the strip.&lt;ref name=syracuse/&gt;

''Prince Valiant'' began in full-color [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] sections on Saturday February 13, 1937. The first [[Comic strip formats|full page]] was strip #16, which appeared in the Sunday ''[[New Orleans Times Picayune]]''. The internal dating changed from Saturday to Sunday with strip #66 (May 15, 1938). The full-page strip continued until 1971, when strip #1788 was not offered in full-page format—it was the last strip Foster drew. The strip continues today by other artists in a [[half page|half-page]] format.&lt;ref name=companion/&gt;

==Characters and story==
[[File:Princevaliant022650.jpg|right|thumb|460px|Hal Foster's ''Prince Valiant'' (February 26, 1950)]]

The setting is Arthurian. Valiant (Val) is a [[Norsemen|Nordic]] prince from [[Thule]], located near present day [[Trondheim]] on the [[Norway|Norwegian]] coast. Early in the story Valiant arrives at [[Camelot]] where he becomes friends with Sir [[Gawain]] and Sir [[Tristan|Tristram]]. Earning the respect of [[King Arthur]] and [[Merlin (wizard)|Merlin]] he becomes a Knight of the [[Round Table (Camelot)|Round Table]]. On a Mediterranean island he meets the love of his life, Aleta, Queen of the Misty Isles, whom he later marries. He fights the [[Hun]]s with his powerful [[Singing Sword]], ''Flamberge'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://weareallus.com/pv/pv1.html Foster, Hal. ''Prince Valiant'', Page 92, panel 7. Prince Valiant Annotations.]&lt;/ref&gt; a magical blade apparently created by the same enchanter who forged Arthur's [[Excalibur]]. Val travels to Africa and America and later helps his father regain his lost throne of Thule, which has been usurped by the tyrant Sligon.&lt;ref name=mark&gt;[http://www.toonopedia.com/val.htm Markstein, Don. Toonopedia: ''Prince Valiant'']&lt;/ref&gt;

When the strip starts in 1937, Val is five years old. The first episodes follow the youth through the wild Fens district of Britain with his father, the deposed King Aguar of Thule. When Val encounters the witch Horrit she predicts he will have a life of adventure, noting that he will soon experience grief. Arriving home, Val discovers that his mother has died. Not long after this come encounters with Gawain, with gigantic creatures and with the glory of Camelot. Steve Donoghue comments:
{{bquote|At first, in the earliest months of ''Prince Valiant'', Foster’s Arthurian England might easily be confused with the [[Cimmeria (Conan)|Cimmeria]] of ''[[Conan the Barbarian]]'': monsters abound. As a boy, Val fights a ‘dragon’ that looks a lot like a plesiosaur, and he fires his arrows at a rampaging swamp-turtle the size of a [[Ice resurfacer|Zamboni]]. But only a few installments later, this has sublimated somewhat into history: when Val saves his new friend Sir Gawain from a robber knight and Gawain decides to take the villain to Camelot for summary judgement from King Arthur, the whole party is at one point attacked by another enormous beast—only this time it’s a salt water crocodile!... When they all at length succeed in killing the beast, Val is outraged that Gawain still seeks to have the man tried before King Arthur. The young prince naturally speaks up in his outrage before the great king, his queen Guinevere and his feared wizard Merlin—and so a career at Camelot is born. Val becomes Gawain’s squire and almost immediately accompanies him on a quest, during which Gawain is captured and Val must use his wits—smiling and laughing the whole time—to free his mentor. On the trip, Gawain is seriously wounded, and the large panel where Val finally gets him back to Camelot is Foster’s first genuine visual show-stopper in the strip.&lt;ref name=donoghue/&gt;}}

Val acquires the Singing Sword in strips from 1938. The original owner of the Singing Sword is Prince Arn of Ord, Valiant's rival for the maid Ilene. The two men put aside their differences when Ilene is kidnapped by Viking raiders on her way to Ord. Arn hands Valiant the charmed sword to help him hold back their pursuers while he himself rides ahead to free Ilene. The pair continue in their efforts to rescue Ilene, eventually discovering that she has been killed in a shipwreck. Arn gives the Singing Sword to Valiant after that adventure and the two part as friends. Later in the series it is mentioned that the Singing Sword is a sister to King Arthur's Excalibur.&lt;ref name=mark/&gt;&lt;ref name=donoghue&gt;[http://www.openlettersmonthly.com/book-review-prince-valiant-vol-hal-foster/ Donoghue, Steve. Open Letters Monthly, "Prince of a Lost Realm".]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the strips from 1939 Val is knighted by King Arthur, and the following year, he helps to restore his father as King of Thule. Moving across Britain, Europe, and the Holy Land, Val fights invading Goths, Huns and Saxons. In 1946, shortly after Val marries Aleta, she is kidnapped by the Viking raider Ulfran. Val's pursuit takes him past the [[Shetland|Shetland Islands]], the [[Faroe Islands]], [[Iceland]], [[Greenland]], [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] and the [[Saint Lawrence River]], arriving at [[Niagara Falls]] 1,000 years before Columbus. Defeating Ulfran, Val is reunited with Aleta, and the couple spend that winter with friendly [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]].&lt;ref name=mark/&gt;&lt;ref name=bayly&gt;[http://thewildreed.blogspot.com/2010/08/valiant-first-effort-wouldnt-you-say.html Bayly, Michael. "Valiant Prince Turns Fifty". ''Canberra Times'', April 1987.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the strip dated August 31, 1947, Prince Arn, their first son, is born in America, and Val celebrates by getting drunk. The infant Arn is named after Val’s old friend, Prince Arn of Ord. Val and Aleta's other children are the twins, Karen and Valeta (born 1951), Galan (1962) and [[Prince Nathan]] (1979). Agents of the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] Emperor [[Justinian I|Justinian]] abduct Nathan shortly after his birth, and he is eventually rescued by Arn. Earlier, in strips from 1964, Arn leads an expedition to America. In strips from 1987 Val becomes a grandfather when Arn and his wife, Maeve, daughter of the traitorous [[Mordred]], give birth to Ingrid.&lt;ref name=mark/&gt;&lt;ref name=bayly/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://users.skynet.be/fb352790/PV/Intro/charac.html The Characters]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and myth==
The historical and mythological elements of ''Prince Valiant'' were initially chaotic, but soon Foster attempted to bring the facts into order. Some elements of the story place it in the fifth century, such as the death of [[Attila]] the Hun in 453 and [[Geiseric]]'s sacking of [[Rome]] in 455, which Prince Valiant and Aleta witness. The murder of [[Flavius Aëtius|Aëtius]] in 454 differs from the historical version; Valiant and Gawain are blamed for the murder and must flee.

Slightly fantastic elements, like "marsh monsters" (a dinosaur-like creature) and witches, were present in the early years but were later downplayed (as was Merlin's and [[Morgan le Fay]]'s use of magic), so that by 1942, the story became more realistic.&lt;ref name=companion/&gt;

The storyline is not historically accurate. While obviously meant to take place in the mid-fifth century, Foster incorporated [[Wiktionary:anachronistic#English|anachronistic]] elements: [[Viking]] [[Longship]]s, [[Muslim]]s, [[alchemy|alchemist]]s and technological advances not made before the [[Renaissance]]. The fortifications, armor and armament resemble the [[High Middle Ages]].&lt;ref name=companion/&gt;

==Other artists==
[[File:Prince Valiant excerpt 1.jpg|thumb|400px|Hal Foster's ''Prince Valiant'' (June 19, 1938).]]

In 1970, after tryout strips by several artists, Foster invited [[John Cullen Murphy]] to collaborate on the strip.&lt;ref name=mark/&gt; Here is a list of the transition artists:
* #1756 Foster
* #1757 [[Gray Morrow]]
* #1758 Foster
* #1759 Foster
* #1760 Murphy
* #1761 Foster
* #1762 [[Wally Wood]]
* #1763 Foster
* #1764 Murphy
* #1765 [[Gray Morrow]]
* #1766 Murphy
* #1767 [[Gray Morrow]]
* #1768 Foster
* #1769 Murphy
* #1770 [[Gray Morrow]]
* #1771–2 Murphy
* #1773 Foster
* #1774–5 Murphy
* #1776 Foster
* #1777–87 Murphy
* #1788 Foster
* #1789 Murphy

From 1971 on, Murphy drew the strip from Foster scripts and pencil sketches. Foster continued to write the continuity until strip #2241 in 1980. Murphy then drew it solo with scripts by his son [[Cullen Murphy]], an editor of ''[[The Atlantic]]''. Stories by Cullen Murphy included many adventures in which Val is opposed by the Emperor Justinian. John Cullen Murphy's daughter, Mairead, did the lettering and coloring. In March 2004, Murphy retired and turned the strip over to his chosen successor, illustrator [[Gary Gianni]]. Scripting duties were passed on to [[Mark Schultz (comicbook writer)|Mark Schultz]] with Scott Roberts providing the coloring.&lt;ref name=companion/&gt; Schultz continued as the writer when [[Thomas Yeates]] began as the strip's artist on April 1, 2012.

==Awards==
Hal Foster was recognized for his work on the strip with the Banshees' Silver Lady award in 1952, followed by the [[National Cartoonists Society]]'s Reuben Award in 1957, their Story Comic Strip Award in 1964, their Special Features Award in 1966 and 1967, the Gold Key award in 1977, and the Elzie Segar Award in 1978. He was inducted into the Will Eisner Hall of Fame in 1996, and in 2005 he was inducted into the Joe Shuster Canadian Comic Book Creators Hall of Fame for his contributions to comic books. In 2006, Foster was inducted into the [[Society of Illustrators]] Hall of Fame. At age 73, Foster was elected to membership in Great Britain's Royal Society of Arts, an honor given to very few Americans.

Murphy received the National Cartoonists Society Story Comic Strip Award for his work on the strip in 1971, 1974, 1976, 1978, 1984 and 1987. In 1995, the strip was one of 20 included in the [[Comic Strip Classics]] series of commemorative postage stamps.

* A 1985 issue of ''[[Mad (magazine)|Mad]]'' had a recurring section, "The Nasty File", billed as "Snippets that were considered too insulting to publish!"

'''Mohamed Safwat El Sherif''' ({{lang-ar|محمد صفوت الشريف}}) is a former Egyptian politician, having served as Chairman of the [[State Information Service]], Minister of Information, Speaker of the Egyptian [[Shura Council]], and Secretary General of the ruling [[National Democratic Party (Egypt)|National Democratic Party (NDP)]], and Head of the Supreme Press Council&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContentP/1/803/Egypt/Safwat-El-Sherif--We-respect-the-will-of-the-citiz.aspx, ''Safwat El Sherif: "We respect the will of the citizens'']&lt;/ref&gt; and a close aide to [[Hosni Mubarak|President Mohamed Hosni Mubarak]].

El Sherif holds a B.A. degree in [[Military science|Military Sciences]], as well as a multitude of intelligence, information, and communication-based degrees and studies. El Sherif is regarded as one of the longest serving politicians in Egyptian history, serving as Minister of Information from 1982 to 2004.

==Biography==
Mohamed Safwat Yousef El Sherif was born on 19 December 1933 in Gharbia governorate. He graduated with a bachelor's degree in military sciences in 1952. Safwat El Sherif is married to Ikbal Mohamed Atteya Halabi with two sons and a daughter. He was granted an Honorary Ph.D. from Barrington University (USA) in applied information and communication sciences. He also concluded his Military studies at Armed Forces Institutes in the fields of planning, management and communication.

He excelled at post-graduate studies in the International Communication and Public Opinion at the Strategic Studies Institute and completed courses in means of mass communication in the British Information Service in addition to another course at the International Communication Institute in Federal Germany.(citation needed)

In 1957, he was transferred to the General Intelligence Service GIS, where he is regarded as one of the founders of the recruitment department as the service was newly established. He recruited and trained officers for that department. In 1968, he was placed under house arrest during an investigation of Intelligence deviation. However, he was cleared of all charges and was considered a witness to events under investigation. Following the proceedings of the investigation and his clearance of all charges, El Sherif chose a more civilian lifestyle and opened his own private business.

As part of the construction and initiation of the intelligence arm for a prominent [[Gulf states (Middle East)|Gulf state]], El Sherif was summoned to serve as a consultant for the operation, a selection attributed to his vast knowledge in the field and strong ties within intelligence circles. Upon the personal request of [[Anwar Sadat|President Anwar El Sadat]], El Sherif was asked to remain and serve in Egypt and turn down the Gulf state's offer, and to provide his services to the current administration.

In 1975, El Sherif dismantled his profitable import and export business to join the State Information Service SIS. He ascended in leading positions in the SIS from 1975 to 1978. He served as Chairman of the SIS from 1978 to 1980. Late President Anwar El-Sadat then appointed him President of the Egyptian Radio and Television Union in 1980. In 1982, he was appointed by former President Hosni Mubarak to be Minister of Information until the year 2004.

In 1977, El Sherif - among others -  founded the National Democratic Party (NDP) and since then has been a member of the Political Bureau of the NDP. He was also the Rapporteur of Information Committee of the NDP. In 1977, he became Secretary of the NDP for Qasr el Nile constituency. And in 1982 he became NDP Information Secretary as well as a member of NDP General Secretariat. In 1989, he became member of the NDP Political Bureau. In 1990 he became Assistant Secretary General of the NDP.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msa.eun.eg/nnews.asp?n_id=115, "Dr. Safwat El-Sherif "Head of Shura Council" is honoured at MSA"]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 April 1993, El-Sherif escaped an assassination attempt by [[Al-Jama'a al-Islamiyya|Al-Gamaa Al-Islamiya]] (Islamic militant group) with few injuries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2005/725/eg5.htm, "The Hamza connection"]&lt;/ref&gt;

El Sherif is widely regarded as a pioneer in the fields of media, communications &amp; information in the Arab region. He conceptualized and founded of the Egyptian Media Production City (EMPC), also known as the 6th of October Media City. He also founded the Egyptian Satellite Company (Nilesat) in 1996 with the purpose of operating Egyptian Satellites. His forward-thinking attitude and laying the foundations of these progressive mega-projects have earned him a title of "Knight of Arab Media" ( فارس الاعلام العربي).

==Career in Politics==
El Sherif has a long career in politics. He started as member of the Muslim Brotherhood group before the 1952 revolution when he was still a high school and military academy student.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.masrawy.com/News/Egypt/Politics/2012/october/17/5410303.aspx, "Haimeeda: Safawt El-sherif was an MB member"]&lt;/ref&gt; Upon his realization of the readiness for use of violence by the [[Muslim Brotherhood]]. He then moved to the new party of Masr Alfatah after the 1952 revolution. This party was the ruling political party. During the following years the party's name changed from one political stage to the other but he kept the membership till it became the National Democratic party.

In 2001 he was member of NDP Developing Committee and as of September 2002 he became NDP Secretary-General. Since 2004 El-Sherif held the position of Speaker of the Shura Council and the President of the Supreme Press Council till he resigned from NDP on 29 January 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arabcont.com/arabcont.mobi/release_details.aspx?newsID=332,''Mr. Safwat El-Sherif Inspecting Visit to the Final Stages of the Main Hall in the Shura Council'']&lt;/ref&gt; He was later accused of killing youth on 2 February but the court acquitted him of all charges.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shorouknews.com/news/view.aspx?cdate=10102012&amp;id=c54d6446-9fe6-42ff-9b93-90b6a32845d2, "Merits of the judgment 'Camel Battle': Court dropped witnesses testimony and was satisfied «Ruwaini»"]&lt;/ref&gt;

The court said the reasons for its ruling: "The court did not rest assured to witnesses in the case; where were all hearsay and their offspring grudges between the defendants and witnesses, as a result of partisan differences and because of the parliamentary elections."
The court added that «some of the witnesses were registered dangerous, according to the criminal status their own.
The Court noted that the case devoid of any witness sight reassured him, and the Court confirmed that it is satisfied to the testimony of Gen. Hassan Ruwaini, who said he did not register any deaths at Tahrir square during those two days. And his forces did not find any weapons with the defendants who were arrested in Tahrir, and who have been prosecuted militarily in Case 118 for the year 2011 military east of Cairo, and that the court reviewed the case papers and documents and examined them herself, and found no sufficient evidence to convict the accused.
The Court noted that, despite the raised around Callback by some of the defendants, but that did not stop her from realization of justice; «obedience to the words of God" O ye who believe! stand out firmly for Allah, as witnesses to fair dealing, and let not the hatred of others to you make you swerve to wrong and depart from justice. Be just: that is next to piety: and fear Allah. For Allah is well-acquainted with all that ye do.".
The Court explained that the rest of the prosecution witnesses against the accused, has been jailed on charges of perjury.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3496">'''Samuel Rhoads Fisher''' was the secretary of the [[Navy]] of the [[Republic of Texas]].&lt;ref name=HTO&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/ffi23|title=Fisher, Samuel Rhoads|publisher=Texas State Historical Association|accessdate=2012-05-24|author=L W Kemp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was born in [[Pennsylvania]] on December 31, 1794 and settled in Texas in 1830 with his wife and four children in the Matagorda area. He represented Matagorda Municipality in the Convention of 1836 at [[Washington-on-the-Brazos]] where he signed the [[Texas Declaration of Independence]].  President [[Sam Houston]] nominated Fisher as [[Texas Secretary of the Navy|Secretary]] of the [[Texas Navy]] and the appointment was confirmed by the Senate on October 28, 1836.&lt;ref name=HTO/&gt;

A letter to presidential candidate [[Mirabeau B. Lamar]] in August 1838 from [[George Wheelwright]] urged reconsideration of Fisher for Secretary for the good of the navy and defense of the Republic and Houston suspended Fisher from office in October 1837, to secure "harmony and efficiency".  Many in the senate opposed the move and the Senate ordered Fisher's reinstatement on October 18, 1837. This event was a major incident in the early days of the Republic of Texas and added to the severe split between the various factions in the government.

Sam Houston Dixon in "The Men Who Made Texas Free" wrote that "when Mr. Fisher died, Richard Ellis, who was president of the convention which declared Texas independent of Mexico, said from the floor of the Senate:  'In the death of Rhodes Fisher the Republic has lost one of its wisest defenders. He was a man of poise even midst times of stress and excitement. Well do some of us remember his cool and deliberate consideration of our acts at Old Washington, March, 1836; how his voice of caution rang out as men of zeal vied with one another in their precipitous rush to complete their labors of establishing a government and returning to their homes. So earnestly did he plead and so logical was his appeal that we were persuaded to follow his advice........There was nothing of the braggadocio about him and he did not lack courage to express his opinions.'"

Fisher died on March 14, 1839, and was buried at Matagorda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/ffi23|title=Fisher County|publisher=Texas State Historical Association|accessdate=2012-05-24|author=Hooper Shelton}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fisher County]], established in 1876, was named after him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9V1IAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA126#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | title=The Origin of Certain Place Names in the United States | publisher=Govt.

==Early career==
From 1984 to 1986, Berkley worked as a medical epidemiologist for the Center for Infectious Diseases of the U.S. [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) in Atlanta, GA. While working for the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]], Berkley was involved in, among other things, managing the national [[Toxic Shock Syndrome]] surveillance system. He also conducted an investigation of an outbreak of [[Brazilian Purpuric Fever]], a disease that was killing children in [[Brazil]], and helped to discover the etiologic agent. In 1986, on assignment from the CDC, Berkley served as an [[epidemiologist]] for the [[Massachusetts Department of Public Health]], working on routine surveillance and outbreak investigations.

A year later, while working for the Carter Presidential Center in [[Atlanta]], Berkley was assigned as an [[epidemiologist]] at the Ministry of Health in [[Uganda]]. In this role, he worked to establish and manage the Ugandan surveillance system for AIDS, validate the AIDS clinical case definition for [[Africa]] and assist with the conduct and analysis of the national [[HIV]] sero-survey. Berkley played a role in helping to develop Uganda’s National AIDS Control programs, and served as an [[attending]] internal medicine [[physician]] at [[Mulago Hospital]] in [[Kampala]].

Subsequently, Berkley worked for the [[Rockefeller Foundation]], initially as Program Scientist and finally as Associate Director of the Health Sciences Division. During his eight years with the [[Rockefeller Foundation]], Berkley managed programs in [[epidemiology]], [[public health]], medical and nursing education, [[vaccination]], AIDS and [[sexually transmitted diseases]] and [[reproductive health]] in [[Africa]], [[Asia]], and [[Latin America]]. Some of his initiatives included developing a public health training program, Public Health School without Walls, which began in [[Zimbabwe]], [[Ghana]], Uganda, and then spread to [[Vietnam]], as well as an international program to support [[non-governmental organizations]] working on AIDS, the [[International HIV/AIDS Alliance]].

==GAVI Alliance==
Berkley joined the GAVI Alliance as its [[Chief Executive Officer]] (CEO) in August 2011.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gavialliance.org/library/news/gavi-features/2011/seth-berkley-new-gavi-ceo/&lt;/ref&gt; The GAVI Alliance is a public-private partnership whose mission is to save children’s lives and protect people’s health by increasing access to immunisation in developing countries.

Since its launch in 2000, GAVI has prevented more than five million future deaths and helped protect 288 million children with new and underused vaccines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/pmnch/media/membernews/2011/20110524_gavi_pledging_conference/en/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-08-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121023111110/http://www.who.int/pmnch/media/membernews/2011/20110524_gavi_pledging_conference/en/ |archivedate=2012-10-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Under Berkley’s leadership, the Alliance plans to deliver vaccines to another quarter of a billion children and prevent four million more deaths by 2015.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gavialliance.org/funding/resource-mobilisation/process/gavi-pledging-conference-june-2011/&lt;/ref&gt;

The GAVI Alliance brings together developing country and donor governments, the [[World Health Organization]], [[UNICEF]], the [[World Bank]], the vaccine industry in both industrialised and developing countries, research and technical agencies, civil society organizations, the [[Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation]] and other private philanthropists.&gt;

==The IAVI Years==
In 1994, the Rockefeller Foundation, where Berkley was serving as Associate Director of Health Sciences, convened a series of international consensus meetings on the need for a new effort to address existing barriers to the development of an [[AIDS vaccine]] and jump-start AIDS vaccine research. These meetings, culminating in a conference in [[Bellagio (Italian region)|Bellagio]], [[Italy]], became the impetus for the establishment of IAVI in 1996 as an international [[NGO]] tasked with aggressively pursuing previously neglected approaches to AIDS vaccine development. Berkley was appointed interim President and later became CEO.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iavi.org/Lists/IAVIPublications/attachments/a023160f-e079-48fb-919e-c95addab80c1/IAVI_Entering_a_New_Decade_Opportunities_for_IAVI_2007_ENG.pdf Kuipers, Hester and Kate Taylor.

Under Berkley’s leadership, the organization evolved into a worldwide public-private product development partnership with a staff of more than 200 employees that has worked with partners in 25 countries and, with partners, conducted 24 HIV vaccine trials.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iavi.org/about-IAVI/Pages/what-we-do.aspx IAVI Website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110903045736/http://www.iavi.org/about-IAVI/Pages/what-we-do.aspx |date=2011-09-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Firestone was born Shulamith Bath Shmuel Ben Ari Feuerstein&lt;ref name=Fox30Aug2012/&gt; in [[Ottawa]], Canada. She was born on January 7th, 1945&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Encyclopedia of World Biography. Ed. Tracie Ratiner. Vol. 27. 2nd ed. Detroit: Gale, 2007. p129-131.&lt;/ref&gt; and was the second of six children and the first daughter of [[Orthodox Jewish]] parents Kate Weiss, a German, and Sol Feuerstein, a Brooklyn salesman.&lt;ref name=Faludi15Apr2013/&gt; In April 1945, when Firestone was four months old, her father took part in the liberation of the [[Bergen-Belsen concentration camp]] in Germany.&lt;ref name=Faludi15Apr2013&gt;{{cite news|last1=Faludi|first1=Susan|title=Death of a Revolutionary|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/04/15/death-of-a-revolutionary|work=The New Yorker|date=April 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|The camp was liberated by the British Army's 63rd Anti-Tank Regiment, and handed over to the British Second Army and a Canadian unit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Reilly|first1=Joanne|title=Belsen: The Liberation of a Concentration Camp|date=1998|publisher=Routledge|location=London and New York|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hirsh|first1=Michael|title=The Liberators: America's Witnesses to the Holocaust|date=2010|publisher=Random House Publishing Group|location=New York|page=107}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

When she was a child, the family [[Anglicisation of names|Anglicized]] their surname to Firestone and moved to [[St. Louis, Missouri]].&lt;ref name=Faludi15Apr2013/&gt; Her father had converted to [[Orthodox Judaism]] when he was a teenager and, according to [[Susan Faludi]], he exercised tight control over his children, with the zeal of a convert. One of her sisters,[[Tirzah Firestone]], told Faludi: "My father threw his rage at Shulie." She railed against the family's sexism; Firestone was expected to make her brother's bed, "[b]ecause you're a girl", her father told her. Laya Firestone Seghi, another sister, remembers father and daughter threatening to kill one another.&lt;ref name=Faludi15Apr2013/&gt;

Firestone attended Yavneh Teacher's Seminary in Cleveland (sister institution of Telshe Yeshiva), received a BA from [[Washington University in St. Louis]] and, in 1967, a [[Bachelor of Fine Arts|BFA]] degree in painting from the [[School of the Art Institute of Chicago]] (SAIC).&lt;ref name=Ackelsberg&gt;{{cite web| url=http://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/firestone-shulamith|title=Shulamith Firestone, 1945–2012|first=Martha|last=Ackelsberg|work=Jewish Women: A Comprehensive Historical Encyclopedia|date=March 1, 2009|publisher=Jewish Women's Archive|accessdate=June 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Fox30Aug2012/&gt; In 1967, during her studies at SAIC, she was the subject of a student documentary film.

==Activism==
===New York Radical Women===
In October 1967, Firestone moved to [[New York City]] and co-founded [[New York Radical Women]] (NYRW). The first and only national convention of the National Conference for New Politics was held that year. Firestone attended and, with [[Jo Freeman]], formed a woman's caucus, which tried to present its own demands to the plenary session.&lt;ref name="Hall2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hall|first=Simon|title=American Patriotism, American Protest: Social Movements Since the Sixties|date=6 June 2011|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|isbn=0-8122-0365-8|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=jhmQvhJMUagC&amp;pg=PA61 61]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The women were told their resolution was not important enough for a floor discussion. They eventually managed to have their statement added to the end of the agenda, but it was not discussed. The director, Willam F. Pepper, refused to recognize any of the women waiting to speak and instead called on someone to speak about "the forgotten American, the American Indian". When five women, including Firestone, ran to the podium to protest, Pepper patted Firestone on the head and said, "Cool down, little girl; we have more important things to talk about than women's problems."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Freeman|first1=Jo|editor1-last=Freeman|editor1-first=Jo|editor2-last=Johnson|editor2-first=Victoria|title=Waves of Protest: Social Movements Since the Sixties|date=1999|publisher=Rowman and Littlefield Publishers, Inc.|location=Lanham|pages=(7–24), 19|chapter=On the Origins of Social Movements}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hall2011"/&gt;

Firestone and Freeman called a meeting of the women who had been at the “free school” course and the women’s workshop at the conference; this became the first Chicago women’s liberation group. It was known as the Westside group because it met weekly in Freeman’s apartment on Chicago’s west side. After a few months Freeman started a newsletter, Voice of the Women’s Liberation Movement. It circulated nationwide (and in a few foreign countries), giving the new movement its name. Many of the women in the Westside group went on to start other feminist organizations, including the [[Chicago Women's Liberation Union]].

===Redstockings, New York Radical Feminists===
When NYRW formed "[[consciousness raising]] groups", Firestone and [[Ellen Willis]] co-founded the radical feminist group [[Redstockings]], named after the [[Blue Stockings Society]], an 18th-century women's literary group.&lt;ref name=Ackelsberg/&gt; Redstocking members included [[Kathie Sarachild]] ("Sisterhood is Powerful") and [[Carol Hanisch]] ("the personal is political"). Faludi writes that the Redstockings "fell apart" in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Faludi|first1=Susan|title=A Note on the New York Radical Feminists|url=https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/a-note-on-the-new-york-radical-feminists|work=The New Yorker|date=April 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Firestone then co-founded [[New York Radical Feminists]] (NYRF) with [[Anne Koedt]].&lt;ref name=Ackelsberg/&gt;

==Writing==
===''Notes''===
With others from New York Radical Feminists, Firestone created and edited a feminist periodical, ''Notes'', producing ''Notes from the First Year'' (June 1968), ''Notes from the Second Year'' (1970), and, with [[Anne Koedt]] as editor while Firestone was on leave, ''Notes from the Third Year'' (1971).&lt;ref name=Ackelsberg/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Firestone, Shulamith (June 1968). ed.

===''The Dialectic of Sex''===
''[[The Dialectic of Sex|The Dialectic of Sex: The Case for Feminist Revolution]]'' (1970) became a classic text of [[second-wave feminism]]. This was Firestone's first book and was published when she was just 25.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/31/nyregion/shulamith-firestone-feminist-writer-dies-at-67.html|title=Shulamith Firestone, Feminist Writer, Dies at 67|first=Margalit|last=Fox|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the book, Firestone sought to develop a [[Historical materialism|materialist view of history]] based on sex:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Firestone|first1=Shulamith|title=[[The Dialectic of Sex|The Dialectic of Sex: The Case for Feminist Revolution]]|date=1970|publisher=William Morrow and Company|location=New York|page=25|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also notable within the book is the ideal society Firestone creates, one void of the oppression of women.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/e/9781317192763 {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Just as to ensure elimination of economic classes requires the revolt of the underclass (the proletariat) and, in a temporary dictatorship, their seizure of the means of ''production'', so to assure the elimination of sexual classes requires the revolt of the underclass (women) and the seizure of control of ''reproduction'': not only the full restoration to women of ownership of their own bodies, but also their [temporary) seizure of control of human fertility—the new population biology as well as all the social institutions of child-bearing and child-rearing.&amp;nbsp;... [T]he end goal of feminist revolution must be, unlike that of the first feminist movement, not just the elimination of male ''privilege'' but of the sex ''distinction'' itself: genital differences between human beings would no longer matter culturally.{{sfn|Firestone|1970|p=11}}}}

Firestone synthesized the ideas of [[Sigmund Freud]], [[Wilhelm Reich]], [[Karl Marx]], [[Frederick Engels]], and [[Simone de Beauvoir]] into a radical feminist theory of politics.&lt;ref&gt;Rich, Jennifer (2014) [2007]. ''Modern Feminist Theory''. Penrith: Humanities-Ebooks LLP, pp.&amp;nbsp; [https://books.google.com/books?id=SjVHBKMnzMAC&amp;pg=PA21 21ff]. {{ISBN|978-1-84760-023-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also acknowledged the influence of Lincoln H. and Alice T. Day's ''Too Many Americans'' (1964) and the 1968 best-seller ''[[The Population Bomb]]'' by [[Paul R. Ehrlich]]. 

Firestone argued within her book that modern society could not achieve true gender equality until women's biological traits are separated from their gender identity.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Firestone argued Freud and Marx had ignored what she called the "sex class", the domination of women by men because of their biology. [[Gender inequality]] originates in the [[patriarchy|patriarchal]] societal structures imposed upon women because of their bodies, she argued, particularly the physical, social and psychological disadvantages caused by [[pregnancy]], [[childbirth]], and [[child-rearing]].&lt;ref name=Ackelsberg/&gt; To be human is to outgrow nature, she argued: "we can no longer justify the maintenance of a discriminatory sex class system on the grounds of its origin in Nature." The abolition of the sex class requires that women take control of the means of reproduction.&lt;ref&gt;Sydie, R. A. (1994). [https://books.google.com/books?id=bqwkYwHdmc8C&amp;pg=PA143 ''Natural women, cultured men: a feminist perspective on sociological theory''], University of British Columbia Press, p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt; She regarded pregnancy and childbirth as "barbaric" (a friend of hers compared labor to "shitting a pumpkin") and the [[nuclear family]] as a key source of women's oppression. [[Contraception]], [[in vitro fertilization]] and other advances meant that sex would one day be separated from pregnancy and child-rearing, and women could be free. She anticipated that groups of people would in future gather together voluntarily to rear children without resorting to permanent male-female relationships and without the idea that particular children "belong" to one couple.&lt;ref name=Ackelsberg/&gt;

===''Airless Spaces''===
By the time ''The Dialectic of Sex'' was published in 1970, Firestone had largely ceased to be politically active. She withdrew from politics in the early seventies, moved to [[Saint Marks Place]], and worked as a painter. In the late eighties she became mentally ill.

In 1998 she published ''Airless Spaces,'' a collection of short stories based on her experiences being hospitalized for schizophrenia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Airless Spaces|last=Firestone|first=Shulamith|date=March 1, 1998|publisher=Semiotext(e)|isbn=1-57027-082-1|pages=457}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="chesler"&gt;{{cite book |last= Chesler|first= Phyllis|date= 2018|title= A Politically Incorrect Feminist: Creating a Movement with Bitches, Lunatics, Dykes, Prodigies, Warriors, and Wonder Women|url= |location= |publisher= St. Martin's Press|page= 190|isbn= 9781250094421|author-link= Phyllis Chesler}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death and Legacy==
On August 28, 2012, Firestone was found dead in her New York apartment by the building's owner. Alerted by neighbors, who had smelled an odor from her apartment, her superintendent peered in through a window from the fire escape and saw her body on the floor. Her landlord, Bob Perl, said she had probably been dead about a week.&lt;ref name=villager/&gt; According to her sister, Laya Firestone Seghi, she died of natural causes.&lt;ref name=Fox30Aug2012/&gt; Her death was confirmed by the New York City Medical Examiner's Office; according to reports, she lived in a reclusive fashion and had been in ill health.&lt;ref name="tablet"/&gt;&lt;ref name=villager&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Villager|url=http://www.thevillager.com/?p=7172|author=Anderson, Lincoln|title=Shulamith Firestone, radical feminist, wrote best-seller, 67|date=August 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a commemorative essay by [[Susan Faludi]] published several months after Firestone's death, ''[[The New Yorker]]'' magazine further detailed the circumstances of her demise, citing her decades-long struggle with schizophrenia—along with speculation of self-induced starvation—as probable contributing factors.&lt;ref name=Faludi15Apr2013/&gt; A memorial service was arranged in her memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/04/15/death-of-a-revolutionary|title=Death of a Revolutionary|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

''The Dialectic of Sex'' is still used in many women's studies programs. Its recommendations, such as raising children in a gender neutral fashion, mirror the ideals Firestone set out to achieve in her heyday. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2012/08/eulogy-for-a-sex-radical-shulamith-firestones-forgotten-feminism/261834/|title=Eulogy for a Sex Radical: Shulamith Firestone's Forgotten Feminism|first=Emily|last=Chertoff|date=31 August 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sigrid Augusta "Gusta" Green''' gathered intelligence in preparation for the sabotage of [[Norwegian heavy water sabotage|Telemark]] during the Second World War. She worked for the [[Norwegian resistance movement|Norwegian Resistance]] and then at [[Bletchley Park]].

She joined the Women's Auxiliary Air Force at the age of 22, attesting on 10 December 1942.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2012/10/15/article-2217906-158288E4000005DC-664_634x420.jpg|title=Green RAF Service Book page 1&amp;2|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Her bilingual ability from her Norwegian mother (Edith Stafford Green) was quickly recognised and she was seconded to the Norwegian Resistance.

'''Smedley Darlington Butler''' (July 30, 1881{{spaced ndash}}June 21, 1940) was a [[United States Marine Corps]] [[Major general (United States)|major general]], the highest rank authorized at that time, and at the time of his death the most decorated Marine in U.S. history. During his 34-year career as a Marine, he participated in military actions in the Philippines, China, in Central America and the Caribbean during the [[Banana Wars]], and France in [[World War I]]. Butler later became an outspoken critic of U.S. wars and their consequences, as well as exposing an alleged plan to overthrow the U.S. government.

By the end of his career, Butler had received 16&amp;nbsp;medals, five for heroism. He is one of 19 men to receive the [[Medal of Honor]] twice, one of three to be awarded both the [[Marine Corps Brevet Medal]] (along with Wendell Neville and David Porter) and the Medal of Honor, and the only Marine to be awarded the Brevet Medal and two Medals of Honor, all for separate actions.

In 1933, he became involved in a controversy known as the [[Business Plot]], when he told a congressional committee that a group of wealthy industrialists were planning a [[Coup d'état|military coup]] to overthrow [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], with Butler selected to lead a march of veterans to become dictator, similar to Fascist regimes at that time. The individuals involved all denied the existence of a plot and the media ridiculed the allegations, but a final report by a special House of Representatives Committee confirmed some of Butler's testimony.

In 1935, Butler wrote a book titled ''[[War Is a Racket]]'', where he described and criticized the workings of the United States in its foreign actions and wars, such as those he was a part of, including the American corporations and other [[American imperialism|imperialist]] motivations behind them. After retiring from service, he became a popular activist, speaking at meetings organized by veterans, [[Pacifism|pacifists]], and church groups in the 1930s.

==Early life==
Smedley Butler was born July 30, 1881, in [[West Chester, Pennsylvania]], the eldest of three sons. His parents, [[Thomas S. Butler|Thomas]] and Maud (née Darlington) Butler,&lt;ref name="Schmidt7"&gt;Hans Schmidt, ''Maverick Marine: General Smedley D. Butler and the Contradictions of American Military History'' (Lexington: University Press of Kentucky, 1998) p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; were descended from local [[Quaker]] families.  Both of his parents were of entirely [[English American|English ancestry]], all of whom had been in what is now the United States since the 1600s.&lt;ref&gt;Smedley D. Butler, USMC: A Biography  By Mark Strecker page 3&lt;/ref&gt; His father was a lawyer, a judge and, for 31&amp;nbsp;years, a congressman and chair of the House Naval Affairs Committee during the [[Warren G. Harding|Harding]] and [[Calvin Coolidge|Coolidge]] administrations. His maternal grandfather was [[Smedley Darlington]], a Republican congressman from 1887 to 1891.&lt;ref name="WhosWho"&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=August 13, 2013|title=Major General Smedley D.

Butler attended the West Chester Friends Graded High School, followed by The [[Haverford School]], a secondary school popular with sons of upper-class [[Philadelphia]] families.&lt;ref name="Archer38"&gt;Archer, 1973, p. 38&lt;/ref&gt; A Haverford athlete, he became captain of its baseball team and quarterback of its football team.&lt;ref name="Schmidt7" /&gt; Against the wishes of his father, he left school 38 days before his seventeenth birthday to enlist in the Marine Corps during the [[Spanish–American War]]. Nevertheless, Haverford awarded him his high school diploma on June 6, 1898, before the end of his final year. His transcript stated  that he completed the scientific course "with Credit".&lt;ref name="Schmidt7" /&gt;

==Military career==

===Spanish–American War===
In the Spanish war fervor of 1898, Butler lied about his age to receive a direct commission as a Marine [[second lieutenant#United States|second lieutenant]].&lt;ref name="Schmidt7" /&gt; He trained in [[Washington, DC]], at the [[Marine Barracks, Washington, D.C.|Marine Barracks]] on the corner of 8th and I Streets SE. In July 1898 he went to [[Guantánamo Bay]], [[Cuba]], arriving shortly after its [[Battle of Guantánamo Bay|invasion and capture]].&lt;ref name="letters"&gt;Butler, Smedley Darlington and Venzon, Anne Cipria, 1992, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; His company soon returned to the U.S., and after a short break he was assigned to the armored cruiser {{USS|New York|ACR-2|6}} for four months.&lt;ref name="Schmidt9"&gt;Schmidt, 1998, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; He came home to be mustered out of service in February 1899,&lt;ref name="Schmidt9" /&gt; but on 8 April 1899 he accepted a commission as a [[first lieutenant#United States|first lieutenant]] in the Marine Corps.&lt;ref name="Schmidt9" /&gt;

===Philippine–American War===
The Marine Corps sent him to [[Manila]], [[Philippines]].&lt;ref name="Schmidt10"&gt;Schmidt, 1998, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; On garrison duty with little to do, Butler turned to alcohol to relieve the boredom. He once became drunk and was temporarily relieved of command after an unspecified incident in his room.&lt;ref name="Schmidt11"&gt;Schmidt, 1998, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1899, he saw his first combat action when he led 300 Marines to take the town of [[Noveleta, Cavite|Noveleta]] from Filipino rebels known as ''Insurrectos''. In the initial moments of the assault his [[first sergeant]] was wounded. Butler briefly panicked, but quickly regained his composure and led his Marines in pursuit of the fleeing enemy.&lt;ref name="Schmidt11" /&gt; By noon the Marines had dispersed the rebels and taken the town. One Marine had been killed and ten were wounded. Another 50 Marines had been incapacitated by the humid tropical heat.&lt;ref name="Schmidt12"&gt;Schmidt, 1998, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

After the excitement of this combat, garrison duty again became routine. Butler had a very large [[Eagle, Globe, and Anchor]] tattoo made which started at his throat and extended to his waist. He also met [[Littleton Waller]], a fellow Marine with whom he maintained a lifelong friendship. When Waller received command of a company in [[Guam]], he was allowed to select five officers to take with him. He chose Butler. Before they had departed, their orders were changed and they were sent to China aboard the {{USS|Solace|AH-2|6}} to help put down the [[Boxer Rebellion]].&lt;ref name="Schmidt12" /&gt;

===Boxer Rebellion===
[[File:Gallentry Storming of Tientsin.png|thumbnail|left|Butler being carried on the back of another Marine to safety across a river at the Battle of Tientsin.]]
Once in China, Butler was initially deployed at [[Tianjin|Tientsin]]. He took part in the [[Battle of Tientsin]] on July 13, 1900, and in the subsequent [[Gaselee Expedition]], during which he saw the mutilated remains of Japanese soldiers. When he saw another Marine officer fall wounded, he climbed out of a trench to rescue him. Butler was then himself shot in the thigh. Another Marine helped him get to safety, but also was shot. Despite his leg wound, Butler assisted the wounded officer to the rear. Four [[enlisted men]] would receive the Medal of Honor in the battle. Butler's commanding officer, Maj. Littleton W.T. Waller, personally commended him and wrote that "for such reward as you may deem proper the following officers: Lieutenant Smedley D. Butler, for the admirable control of his men in all the fights of the week, for saving a wounded man at the risk of his own life, and under a very severe fire." Commissioned officers were not then eligible to receive the Medal of Honor, and Butler instead received a promotion to [[Captain (United States)|captain]] by [[brevet (military)|brevet]] while he recovered in the hospital, two weeks before his 19th birthday.

He was eligible for the Marine Corps [[Brevet Medal]] when it was created in 1921, and was one of only 20 Marines to receive it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.history.navy.mil/docs/boxer/boxer2.htm|title=Report of the Commandant of the United States Marine Corps, Marines in China: The Relief Expedition|publisher=[[United States Marine Corps]]|date=September 29, 1900|accessdate=August 17, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; His citation reads: {{quote|The Secretary of the Navy takes pleasure in transmitting to First Lieutenant Smedley Darlington Butler, United States Marine Corps, the Brevet Medal which is awarded in accordance with Marine Corps Order No. 26 (1921), for distinguished conduct and public service in the presence of the enemy while serving with the Second Battalion of Marines, near Tientsin, China, on 13 July 1900. On 28 March 1901, First Lieutenant Butler is appointed Captain by brevet, to take rank from 13 July 1900.&lt;ref name=Militarytimes /&gt;}}

===The Banana Wars===
Butler participated in a series of occupations, "police actions" and interventions by the United States in Central America and the [[Caribbean]], commonly called the [[Banana Wars]] because their goal was to protect American commercial interests in the region, particularly those of the [[United Fruit Co]]. This company had significant financial stakes in the production of bananas, tobacco, sugar cane and other products throughout the Caribbean, Central America and the northern portions of [[South America]]. The U.S. was also trying to advance its own political interests by maintaining its influence in the region and especially its control of the [[Panama Canal]]. These interventions started with the Spanish–American War in 1898 and ended with the [[United States occupation of Haiti|withdrawal of troops from Haiti]] and President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s [[Good Neighbor Policy]] in 1934.&lt;ref name="langley"&gt;Langley, 1983&lt;/ref&gt; After his retirement, Butler became an outspoken critic of the business interests in the Caribbean, criticizing the ways in which U.S. businesses and [[Wall Street]] bankers imposed their agenda on United States foreign policy during this period.&lt;ref name="Schmidt231" /&gt;

====Honduras====
In 1903 Butler was stationed in [[Puerto Rico]] on [[Culebra, Puerto Rico|Culebra Island]]. Hearing rumors of a Honduran revolt, the United States government ordered his unit and a supporting naval detachment to sail to Honduras, {{convert|1500|mi|0|sp=us}} to the west, to defend the [[List of diplomatic missions of the United States|U.S. Consulate]] there. Using a converted banana boat renamed the ''Panther'', Butler and several hundred Marines landed at the port town of [[Puerto Cortés]]. In a letter home, he described the action: they were "prepared to land and shoot everybody and everything that was breaking the peace",&lt;ref name="Schmidt28-32"&gt;Schmidt, 1998, pp. 28–32&lt;/ref&gt; but instead found a quiet town. The Marines re-boarded the ''Panther'' and continued up the coast line, looking for rebels at several towns, but found none.

When they arrived at [[Trujillo, Honduras|Trujillo]], however, they heard gunfire, and came upon a battle in progress that had been waged for 55 hours between rebels called ''Bonillista'' and Honduran government soldiers at a local fort. At the sight of the Marines, the fighting ceased and Butler led a detachment of Marines to the American consulate, where he found the consul, wrapped in an American flag, hiding among the floor beams. As soon as the Marines left the area with the shaken consul, the battle resumed and the Bonillistas soon controlled the government.&lt;ref name="Schmidt28-32" /&gt; During this expedition Butler earned the first of his nicknames, "Old Gimlet Eye". It was attributed to his feverish, bloodshot eyes—he was suffering from some unnamed tropical fever at the time—that enhanced his penetrating and bellicose stare.&lt;ref name="Schmidt50"&gt;Schmidt, 1998, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt;

====Marriage and business====
After the Honduran campaign Butler returned to Philadelphia. He married Ethel Conway Peters of Philadelphia in [[Bay Head, New Jersey]], on June 30, 1905.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Butler−Peters|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1905/07/01/101705904.pdf|accessdate=9 October 2012|newspaper=New York Times|date=1 July 1905}}&lt;/ref&gt; His best man at the wedding was his former commanding officer in China, Lt. Col. [[Littleton Waller]].&lt;ref name="Schmidt39"&gt;Schmidt, 1998, p. 39&lt;/ref&gt; The couple eventually had three children: a daughter, Ethel Peters Butler (Mrs. John Wehle), and two sons, Smedley Darlington Jr. and Thomas Richard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mrs. Smedley Butler|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1962/06/16/102999712.pdf|accessdate=9 October 2012|newspaper=New York Times|date=16 June 1962}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Butler was next assigned to garrison duty in the [[Philippines]], where he once launched a resupply mission across the stormy waters of [[Subic Bay]] after his isolated outpost ran out of rations. In 1908 he was diagnosed as having a nervous breakdown and received nine months sick leave, which he spent at home. He successfully managed a coal mine in [[West Virginia]], but returned to active duty in the Marine Corps at the first opportunity.&lt;ref name=boot144&gt;Boot, 2003, p. 144&lt;/ref&gt;

====Central America====
From 1909-12 Butler served in [[Nicaragua]] enforcing U.S. policy. With a 104-degree fever he led his battalion to the relief of a rebel-besieged city, [[Granada, Nicaragua|Granada]]. In December 1909 he commanded the [[3rd Battalion 1st Marines|3d Battalion, 1st Marine Regiment]] on the [[Isthmus of Panama]]. On August 11, 1912, he was temporarily detached to command an expeditionary battalion he led in the [[Battle of Masaya]] on September 19, 1912, and the bombardment, assault and capture of [[Coyotepe Hill]], Nicaragua, in October 1912. He remained in Nicaragua until November 1912, when he rejoined the Marines of [[3rd Battalion 1st Marines|3d Battalion, 1st Marine Regiment]], at [[Camp Elliott]], [[Panama]].&lt;ref name="WhosWho" /&gt;

====Veracruz, Mexico, and first Medal of Honor====
[[File:butlerveracruz.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Marine Officers at Veracruz. Front row, left to right: [[Wendell C. Neville]]; [[John A. Lejeune]]; Littleton W.T. Waller, Commanding; Smedley Butler|alt=Eight people in military uniforms. They are wearing hats and are standing in formation.]]
Butler and his family were living in Panama in January 1914 when he was ordered to report as the Marine officer of a battleship squadron massing off the coast of [[Mexico]], near [[Veracruz]], to monitor a revolutionary movement. He did not like leaving his family and the home they had established in Panama and intended to request orders home as soon as he determined he was not needed.&lt;ref name="Schmidt60-61"&gt;Schmidt, 1998, pp. 60–61&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 March 1914, Butler and Navy Lt. (later Adm.) [[Frank Jack Fletcher|Frank J. Fletcher]] (not to be confused with his uncle, who was then Rear Adm. [[Frank Friday Fletcher|Frank F. Fletcher]]) "went ashore at Veracruz, where they met the American superintendent of the Inter-Oceanic Railway and surreptitiously rode in his private car [a railway car] up the line 75 miles to [[Xalapa|Jalapa]] and back".&lt;ref name="Schmidt64w"&gt;Schmidt, 1998, p. 64&lt;/ref&gt; A purpose of the trip was to allow Butler and Fletcher to discuss the details of a future expedition into Mexico. Fletcher's plan required Butler to make his way into the country and develop a more detailed invasion plan while inside its borders. It was a spy mission and Butler was enthusiastic to get started. When Adm. Fletcher explained the plan to the commanders in Washington, DC, they agreed to it. Butler was given the go-ahead.

A few days later he set out by train on his spy mission to Mexico City, with a stopover at Puebla. He made his way to the U.S. Consulate in [[Mexico City]], posing as a railroad official named "Mr. Johnson".
* ''March 5th''. As I was reading last night, waiting for dinner to be served, a visitant, rather than a visitor, appeared in my drawing-room ''incognito'' – a simple "Mr. Johnson," eager, intrepid, dynamic, efficient, unshaven! * * * &lt;ref name="O'Shaughnessy"&gt;Edith O'Shaughnessy, ''A Diplomat's Wife in Mexico'' (Harper &amp; Brothers, 1916) p. 212&lt;/ref&gt;

He and the chief railroad inspector scoured the city, saying they were searching for a lost railroad employee; there was no lost employee, and in fact the employee they said was lost never existed. The ruse gave Butler access to various areas of the city. In the process of the so-called search, they located weapons in use by the Mexican army and determined the size of units and states of readiness. They updated maps and verified the railroad lines for use in an impending US invasion.&lt;ref name="Schmidt64-65"&gt;Schmidt, 1998, pp. 64–65&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 7, 1914, he returned to Veracruz with the information he had gathered and presented it to his commanders. The invasion plan was eventually scrapped when authorities loyal to Mexican Gen. [[Victoriano Huerta]] detained a small American naval landing party (that had gone ashore to buy gasoline) in [[Tampico, Mexico]], which led to what became known as the [[Tampico Affair]].&lt;ref name="Schmidt67-68"&gt;Schmidt, 1998, pp. 67–68&lt;/ref&gt;

When President [[Woodrow Wilson]] discovered that an arms shipment was about to arrive in Mexico, he sent a contingent of Marines and sailors to Veracruz to intercept it on April 21, 1914. Over the next few days street fighting and sniper fire posed a threat to Butler's force, but a door-to-door search rooted out most of the resistance. By April 26 the landing force of 5,800 Marines and sailors secured the city, which they held for the next six months. By the end of the conflict the Americans reported 17 dead and 63 wounded and the Mexican forces had 126 dead and 195 wounded. After the actions at Veracruz, the US decided to minimize the bloodshed and changed their plans from a full invasion of Mexico to simply [[United States occupation of Veracruz|maintaining the city of Veracruz]].&lt;ref name="Schmidt68-70"&gt;Schmidt, 1998, pp. 68–70&lt;/ref&gt; For his actions on April 22, Butler was awarded his first Medal of Honor.&lt;ref name="WhosWho" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Militarytimes /&gt; The citation reads: {{quote|For distinguished conduct in battle, engagement of Vera Cruz, 22 April 1914. Major Butler was eminent and conspicuous in command of his battalion. He exhibited courage and skill in leading his men through the action of the 22d and in the final occupation of the city.&lt;ref name=Militarytimes /&gt;}}

After the occupation of Veracruz, many military personnel received the Medal of Honor, an unusually high number that somewhat diminished the prestige of the award. The army presented one, nine went to Marines and 46 were bestowed upon naval personnel. During World War I Butler, then a [[Major (United States)|major]], attempted to return his medal, explaining he had done nothing to deserve it. The medal was returned to him with orders to keep it and to wear it as well.&lt;ref name=AboveAndBeyond114&gt;{{cite book |title=Above and Beyond, A History of the Medal of Honor from the Civil War to Vietnam |page=113 |author=Editors of the Boston Publishing Company |year=1985 |isbn=978-0-8094-5628-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Haiti and second Medal of Honor====
In 1915 Haitian President [[Vilbrun Guillaume Sam]] was killed by a mob. In response, the United States ordered the {{USS|Connecticut|BB-18|6}} to Haiti with Maj. Butler and a group of Marines on board. On October 24, 1915, an estimated 400 ''Cacos'' [[Battle of Fort Dipitie|ambushed]] Butler's patrol of 44 mounted Marines when they approached [[Fort Dipitie]]. Surrounded by ''Cacos'', the Marines maintained their perimeter throughout the night. The next morning they charged the much larger enemy force by breaking out in three directions. The startled Haitians fled.&lt;ref name="Schmidt80"&gt;Schmidt, 1998, p. 80&lt;/ref&gt; In early November Butler and a force of 700 Marines and sailors returned to the mountains to clear the area. At their temporary headquarters base at Le Trou they fought off an attack by about 100 ''Cacos''. After the Americans took several other forts and ramparts during the following days, only [[Fort Rivière]], an old French-built stronghold atop [[Montagne Noire]], was left.&lt;ref name="Schmidt80" /&gt;

For the operation Butler was given three companies of Marines and some sailors from the USS ''Connecticut'', about 100 men. They encircled the fort and gradually closed in on it. Butler reached the fort from the southern side with the 15th Company and found a small opening in the wall. The Marines entered through the opening and engaged the ''Cacos'' in hand-to-hand combat. Butler and the Marines took the rebel stronghold on November 17, an action for which he received his second Medal of Honor, as well as the Haitian Medal of Honor.&lt;ref name=Militarytimes&gt;{{Hall of Valor|2879|accessdate=March 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The entire battle lasted less than 20 minutes. Only one Marine was injured in the assault when he was struck by a rock and lost two teeth.&lt;ref name="Schmidt1995p85" /&gt; All 51 Haitians in the Fort were killed.&lt;ref name="Schmidt80" /&gt; Butler's exploits impressed [[Assistant Secretary of the Navy]] [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], who recommended the award based upon Butler's performance during the engagement.&lt;ref name="Schmidt1995p81"&gt;Schmidt, 1995, p. 81&lt;/ref&gt; Once the medal was approved and presented in 1917, Butler achieved the distinction, shared with Dan Daly, of being the only Marines to receive the Medal of Honor twice for separate actions.&lt;ref name="WhosWho" /&gt; The citation reads: {{quote|For extraordinary heroism in action as Commanding Officer of detachments from the 5th, 13th, 23d Companies and the Marine and sailor detachment from the U.S.S. Connecticut, Major Butler led the attack on Fort Rivière, Haiti, 17 November 1915. Following a concentrated drive, several different detachments of Marines gradually closed in on the old French bastion fort in an effort to cut off all avenues of retreat for the Caco bandits. Reaching the fort on the southern side where there was a small opening in the wall, Major Butler gave the signal to attack and Marines from the 15th Company poured through the breach, engaged the Cacos in hand-to-hand combat, took the bastion and crushed the Caco resistance. Throughout this perilous action, Major Butler was conspicuous for his bravery and forceful leadership.&lt;ref name=Militarytimes /&gt;}}

Subsequently, as the initial organizer and commanding officer of the [[Gendarmerie d'Haïti]], the native police force, Butler established a record as a capable administrator. Under his supervision social order, administered by the dictatorship, was largely restored and many vital public works projects were successfully completed.&lt;ref name="Schmidt92"&gt;Schmidt, 1998, p. 92&lt;/ref&gt; He recalled later that, during his time in Haiti, he and his troops "hunted the ''Cacos'' like pigs."&lt;ref name="Schmidt1995p85"&gt;Schmidt, 1995, p. 85&lt;/ref&gt;

===World War I===

[[Wendell Cushing Neville]], [[Lieutenant general (United States)|Lt. Gen.]] [[John Archer Lejeune]]|alt=Four men in military uniforms wearing hats. Three are seated on a bench and one is standing behind the others.]]
During World War I Butler was, to his disappointment, not assigned to a combat command on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]]. He made several requests for a posting in [[France]], writing letters to his personal friend, [[Wendell Cushing Neville]]. While Butler's superiors considered him brave and brilliant, they described him as "unreliable."&lt;ref name="letters" /&gt;

In October 1918 he was promoted to the rank of [[Brigadier general (United States)|brigadier general]] at the age of 37 and placed in command of [[Camp Pontanezen]] at [[Brest, France]], a debarkation depot that funneled troops of the [[American Expeditionary Force]] to the battlefields. The camp had been unsanitary, overcrowded and disorganized. [[U.S. Secretary of War]] [[Newton Baker]] sent novelist [[Mary Roberts Rinehart]] to report on the camp. She later described how Butler tackled the sanitation problems. He began by solving the problem of mud: "[T]he ground under the tents was nothing but mud, [so] he had raided the wharf at Brest of the [[duckboards]] no longer needed for the trenches, carted the first one himself up that four-mile hill to the camp, and thus provided something in the way of protection for the men to sleep on."&lt;ref name="letters" /&gt; [[General officer|Gen.]] [[John J. Pershing]] authorized a duckboard shoulder patch for the units. This earned Butler another nickname, "Old Duckboard." For his exemplary service he was awarded both the [[Distinguished Service Medal (U.S. Army)|Army Distinguished Service Medal]] and [[Navy Distinguished Service Medal]] and the French [[Order of the Black Star]].&lt;ref name="WhosWho" /&gt; The citation for the Army Distinguished Service Medal states: {{quote|The President of the United States of America, authorized by Act of Congress, July 9, 1918, takes pleasure in presenting the Army Distinguished Service Medal to Brigadier General Smedley Darlington Butler, United States Marine Corps, for exceptionally meritorious and distinguished services to the Government of the United States, in a duty of great responsibility during World War I. Brigadier General Butler commanded with ability and energy Pontanezen Camp at Brest during the time in which it has developed into the largest embarkation camp in the world. Confronted with problems of extraordinary magnitude in supervising the reception, entertainment and departure of the large numbers of officers and soldiers passing through this camp, he has solved all with conspicuous success, performing services of the highest character for the American Expeditionary Forces.&lt;ref name=Militarytimes /&gt;}} The citation for the Navy Distinguished Service Medal states: {{quote|The President of the United States of America takes pleasure in presenting the Navy Distinguished Service Medal to Brigadier General Smedley Darlington Butler, United States Marine Corps, for exceptionally meritorious and distinguished services in France, during World War I.

[[File:Smedley D. Butler at Gettysburg, Pennsylvania in 1922.jpg|thumb|200 px|Butler sitting in car at [[Gettysburg, Pennsylvania|Gettysburg]] during a [[Pickett's Charge]] reenactment by Marines in 1922.]]
Following the war, he became Commanding General of the Marine Barracks at [[Marine Corps Base Quantico]], [[Virginia]]. At Quantico he transformed the wartime training camp into a permanent Marine post. During a training exercise in western Virginia in 1921, he was told by a local farmer that [[Stonewall Jackson]]'s arm was buried nearby, to which he replied, "Bosh! I will take a squad of Marines and dig up that spot to prove you wrong!"&lt;ref name="Farwell513"&gt;Farwell, 1993, p. 513&lt;/ref&gt; Butler found the arm in a box. He later replaced the wooden box with a metal one, and reburied the arm. He left a plaque on the granite monument marking the burial place of Jackson's arm; the plaque is no longer on the marker but can be viewed at the Chancellorsville Battlefield visitor's center.&lt;ref name="Farwell513" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Horwitz232"&gt;Horwitz, 1999, p. 232&lt;/ref&gt;

===China and stateside service===
From 1927-29 Butler was commander of the [[Marine Expeditionary Force]] in [[China]] and, while there, cleverly parlayed his influence among various generals and warlords to the protection of U.S. interests, ultimately winning the public acclaim of contending Chinese leaders. When he returned to the United States in 1929 he was promoted to major general, becoming, at age 48, the youngest major general of the Marine Corps. He directed the Quantico camp's growth until it became the "showplace" of the Corps.&lt;ref name="Ward"&gt;Ward&lt;/ref&gt; Butler won national attention by taking thousands of his men on long field marches, many of which he led from the front, to Gettysburg and other [[American Civil War|Civil War]] battle sites, where they conducted large-scale re-enactments before crowds of distinguished spectators.&lt;ref name="Ward" /&gt;

In 1931 Butler violated diplomatic norms by publicly recounting gossip&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Talbot|first=David|title=Devil dog : the amazing true story of the man who saved America|date=2010|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|location=New York|isbn=978-1-4391-0902-1|page=114|edition=1st|others=Spain Rodriguez, illustrator |type=hardcover|quote=as more evidence of Mussolini's road mayhem began to surface...Il Duce's American passenger came forward to corroborate the story.

Butler became the first general officer to be placed under arrest since the Civil War. He apologized to Secretary Adams and the court-martial was canceled with only a reprimand.&lt;ref name=Schmidt212&gt;Schmidt, 1998, p. 212&lt;/ref&gt;

==Director of Public Safety==
At the urging of Butler's father, in 1924 newly elected mayor of Philadelphia [[W. Freeland Kendrick]] asked him to leave the Marines to become the city's Director of Public Safety, the official in charge of running the city's police and fire departments. [[Philadelphia's municipal government]] was notoriously corrupt and Butler initially refused. Kendrick asked President [[Calvin Coolidge]] to intervene. Coolidge contacted Butler and authorized him to take the necessary leave from the Corps. At the request of the president, Butler served in the post from January 1924 until December 1925.&lt;ref name="WhosWho" /&gt; He began his new job by assembling all 4,000 of the city police into the Metropolitan Opera House in shifts to introduce himself and inform them that things would change while he was in charge. He replaced corrupt police officers and, in some cases, switched entire units from one part of the city to another, undermining local protection rackets and profiteering.&lt;ref name="Schmidt146"&gt;Schmidt, 1998, p. 146&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Schmidt147"&gt;Schmidt, 1998, p. 147&lt;/ref&gt;

Within 48 hours of taking over Butler organized raids on more than 900 [[Speakeasy|speakeasies]], ordering them padlocked and, in many cases, destroyed. In addition to raiding the speakeasies, he also attempted to eliminate other illegal activities: bootlegging, prostitution, gambling and police corruption. More zealous than he was political, he ordered crackdowns on the social elite's favorite hangouts, such as the [[Ritz-Carlton]] and the [[Union League]], as well as on drinking establishments that served the working class.&lt;ref name="MarineCorps"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Leatherneck legends; Swapping some sea stories at the birthday ball? Here are 8 of the Corps' best |journal=Marine Corps Times |date=November 15, 2004|pages=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although he was effective in reducing crime and police corruption, he was a controversial leader. In one instance he made a statement that he would promote the first officer to kill a bandit and stated, "I don't believe there is a single bandit notch on a policeman's guns {{Sic}} in this city; go out and get some."&lt;ref name="Schmidt146" /&gt; Although many of the local citizens and police felt that the raids were just a show, they continued for several weeks.&lt;ref name="Schmidt147" /&gt;

He implemented programs to improve city safety and security. He established policies and guidelines of administration and developed a Philadelphia police uniform that resembled that of the Marine Corps.&lt;ref name="Schmidt148"&gt;Schmidt, 1998, p. 148&lt;/ref&gt; Other changes included military-style checkpoints into the city, bandit-chasing squads armed with [[sawed-off shotgun]]s and armored police cars.&lt;ref name="Schmidt148" /&gt; The press began reporting on the good and the bad aspects of Butler's personal war on crime. The reports praised the new uniforms, the new programs and the reductions in crime but they also reflected the public's negative opinion of their new Public Safety Director. Many felt that he was being too aggressive in his tactics and resented the reductions in their civil rights, such as the stopping of citizens at the city checkpoints. Butler frequently swore in his radio addresses, causing many citizens to suggest his behavior, particularly his language, was inappropriate for someone of his rank and stature.&lt;ref name="Schmidt149"&gt;Schmidt, 1998, p. 149&lt;/ref&gt; Some even suggested Butler acted like a military dictator, even charging that he wrongfully used active-duty Marines in some of his raids.&lt;ref name="Schmidt149" /&gt; Maj. R.A. Haynes, the federal Prohibition commissioner, visited the city in 1924, six months after Butler was appointed. He announced that "great progress"&lt;ref name="Schmidt150"&gt;Schmidt, 1998, p. 150&lt;/ref&gt; had been made in the city and attributed that success to Butler.&lt;ref name="Schmidt150" /&gt;

Eventually Butler's leadership style and the directness of actions undermined his support within the community. His departure seemed imminent. Mayor Kendrick reported to the press, "I had the guts to bring General Butler to Philadelphia and I have the guts to fire him."&lt;ref name="Schmidt153"&gt;Schmidt, 1998, p. 153&lt;/ref&gt; Feeling that his duties in Philadelphia were coming to an end, Butler contacted Gen. Lejeune to prepare for his return to the Marine Corps. Not all of the city felt he was doing a bad job, though, and when the news started to leak that he would be leaving, people began to gather at the [[Academy of Music (Philadelphia)|Academy of Music]]. A group of 4,000 supporters assembled and negotiated a truce between him and the mayor to keep him in Philadelphia for a while longer, and the president authorized a one-year extension.&lt;ref name="Schmidt153-4"&gt;Schmidt, 1998, pp. 153–4&lt;/ref&gt;

Butler devoted much of his second year to executing arrest warrants, cracking down on crooked police and enforcing prohibition. On January 1, 1926, his leave from the Marine Corps ended and the President declined a request for a second extension. Butler received orders to report to [[San Diego]] and prepared his family and his belongings for the new assignment.&lt;ref name="Schmidt154-5"&gt;Schmidt, 1998, pp. 154–5&lt;/ref&gt; In light of his pending departure, he began to defy the mayor and other key city officials. On the eve of his departure, he had an article printed in the paper stating his intention to stay and "finish the job".&lt;ref name="Schmidt156-7"&gt;Schmidt, 1998, pp. 156–7&lt;/ref&gt; The mayor was surprised and furious when he read the press release the next morning and demanded his resignation.&lt;ref name="Schmidt156-7" /&gt; After almost two years in office, Butler resigned under pressure, stating later that "cleaning up Philadelphia was worse than any battle I was ever in."&lt;ref name="MarineCorps" /&gt;

==Military retirement==

When [[Commandant of the Marine Corps]] Maj. Gen. [[Wendell C. Neville]] died July 8, 1930, Butler, at that time the senior major general in the Corps, was a candidate for the position.&lt;ref name="Ward" /&gt; Although he had significant support from many inside and outside the Corps, including [[John Lejeune]] and [[Josephus Daniels]], two other Marine Corps generals were seriously considered--[[Ben H. Fuller]] and [[John H. Russell Jr.]]. Lejeune and others petitioned President [[Herbert Hoover]], garnered support in the Senate and flooded Secretary of the Navy Charles Adams' desk with more than 2,500 letters of support.&lt;ref name="Schmidt205-6"&gt;Schmidt, 1998, pp. 205–6&lt;/ref&gt; With the recent death of his influential father, however, Butler had lost much of his protection from his civilian superiors. The outspokenness that characterized his run-ins with the Mayor of Philadelphia, the "unreliability" mentioned by his superiors when opposing a posting to the Western Front and his comments about [[Benito Mussolini]] resurfaced. In the end the position of Commandant went to Fuller, who had more years of commissioned service than Butler and was considered less controversial. Butler requested retirement and left active duty on October 1, 1931.&lt;ref name="letters" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ward" /&gt;

==Later years==
Even before retiring from the Corps, Butler began developing his post-Corps career. In May 1931 he took part in a commission established by [[Oregon]] Governor [[Julius L. Meier]] which laid the foundations for the [[Oregon State Police]].&lt;ref name=OregonPolice&gt;{{cite web |accessdate=October 14, 2007 |url=http://www.oregon.gov/OSP/history.shtml |title=Oregon State Police History |publisher=Oregon State Police, Official Oregon State website |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080117142329/http://www.oregon.gov/OSP/history.shtml |archivedate=January 17, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He began lecturing at events and conferences, and after his retirement from the Marines in 1931 he took this up full-time. He donated much of his earnings from his lucrative lecture circuits to the Philadelphia unemployment relief. He toured the western United States, making 60 speeches before returning for his daughter's marriage to Marine aviator Lt. John Wehle. Her wedding was the only time he wore his dress blue uniform after he left the Marines.&lt;ref name="Schmidt215-16"&gt;Schmidt, 1998, pp. 215–16&lt;/ref&gt;

===Senate campaign===
Butler announced his candidacy for the [[U.S. Senate]] in the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] primary in Pennsylvania in March 1932 as a proponent of [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]], known as a "dry".&lt;ref name="Schmidt215-16" /&gt; Butler allied with [[Gifford Pinchot]] but was defeated in the April 26, 1932, primary election with only 37.5% of the vote to incumbent Sen. [[James J. Davis]]' 60%. A third candidate received the remainder of the votes.&lt;ref name=Schmidt220&gt;Schmidt, 1998, p. 220&lt;/ref&gt; According to biographer Mark Strecker, Butler voted for [[Norman Thomas]] of the [[Socialist Party of America|Socialist Party]] for president in [[United States presidential election, 1936|1936]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Mark Strecker|title=Smedley D. Butler, USMC: A Biography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5vOF9b9amIYC&amp;pg=PA156|year=2011|publisher=McFarland|page=156|isbn=978-0-7864-8477-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bonus Army===
{{Main|Bonus Army}}
During his Senate campaign, Butler spoke out forcefully about the veterans bonus. Veterans of World War I, many of whom had been out of work since the beginning of the [[Great Depression]], sought immediate cash payment of Service Certificates granted to them eight years earlier via the [[World War Adjusted Compensation Act]] of 1924. Each Service Certificate, issued to a qualified veteran soldier, bore a face value equal to the soldier's promised payment, plus [[compound interest]]. The problem was that the certificates (like bonds), matured 20 years from the date of original issuance, thus, under extant law, the Service Certificates could not be redeemed until 1945. In June 1932, approximately 43,000 marchers—17,000 of whom were World War I veterans, their families, and affiliated groups—protested in Washington, D.C.&lt;ref name=FBI&gt;{{cite web |accessdate=March 9, 2010 |url=http://foia.fbi.gov/foiaindex/bonmarch.htm |title=Bonus March |publisher=Federal Bureau of Investigation |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100208194024/http://foia.fbi.gov/foiaindex/bonmarch.htm &lt;!--Added by H3llBot--&gt; |archivedate=February 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bonus Expeditionary Force, also known as the "[[Bonus Army]]", marched on Washington to advocate the passage of the "soldier's bonus" for service during World War I. After Congress adjourned, bonus marchers remained in the city and became unruly. On July 28, 1932, two bonus marchers were shot by police, causing the entire mob to become hostile and riotous. The FBI, then known as the United States Bureau of Investigation, checked its fingerprint records to obtain the police records of individuals who had been arrested during the riots or who had participated in the bonus march.&lt;ref name=FBI /&gt;&lt;ref name="Schmidt216-226"&gt;Schmidt, 1998, pp. 216–226&lt;/ref&gt;

The veterans made camp in the Anacostia flats while they awaited the congressional decision on whether or not to pay the bonus. The motion, known as the [[Wright Patman|Patman]] bill, was decisively defeated, but the veterans stayed in their camp. Butler arrived with his young son Thomas, in mid-July the day before the official eviction by the Hoover administration. He walked through the camp and spoke to the veterans; he told them that they were fine soldiers and they had a right to lobby Congress just as much as any corporation. He and his son spent the night and ate with the men, and in the morning Butler gave a speech to the camping veterans. He instructed them to keep their sense of humor and cautioned them not to do anything that would cost public sympathy.&lt;ref name="Schmidt218"&gt;Schmidt, 1998, p. 218&lt;/ref&gt; On July 28, army cavalry units led by General [[Douglas MacArthur]] dispersed the Bonus Army by riding through it and using gas. During the conflict several veterans were killed or injured and Butler declared himself a "Hoover-for-Ex-President-Republican".&lt;ref name="Schmidt218-219"&gt;Schmidt, 1998, pp. 218–219&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lectures===
He became widely known for his outspoken lectures against [[war profiteer]]ing, U.S. military adventurism, and what he viewed as nascent [[fascism]] in the United States.

In December 1933, Butler toured the country with [[James E. Van Zandt]] to recruit members for the [[Veterans of Foreign Wars]] (VFW). He described their effort as "trying to educate the soldiers out of the sucker class." In his speeches he denounced the [[Economy Act]] of 1933, called on veterans to organize politically to win their benefits, and condemned the FDR administration for its ties to big business. The VFW reprinted one of his speeches with the title "You Got to Get Mad" in its magazine ''Foreign Service''. He said: "I believe in...taking Wall St. by the throat and shaking it up."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ortiz Stephen R | year = 2006 | title = The 'New Deal' for Veterans: The Economy Act, the Veterans of Foreign Wars, and the Origins of the New Deal | url = | journal = Journal of Military History | volume = 70 | issue = | pages = 434–5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He believed the rival veterans' group the [[American Legion]] was controlled by banking interests. On December 8, 1933, he said: "I have never known one leader of the American Legion who had never sold them out—and I mean it."&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'': [https://www.nytimes.com/1933/12/10/archives/butler-for-bonus-out-of-wall-street-advises-exsoldiers-to-shake-it.html "Butler for Bonus out of Wall Street", December 10, 1933], accessed January 10, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to his speeches to pacifist groups, he served from 1935 to 1937 as a spokesman for the [[American League Against War and Fascism]].&lt;ref name="Schmidt234"&gt;Schmidt, 1998, p. 234&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Klehr"&gt;Klehr, 1984, pp. 110–12, 372–73&lt;/ref&gt; In 1935, he wrote the exposé ''[[War Is a Racket]]'', a trenchant condemnation of the profit motive behind warfare. His views on the subject are summarized in the following passage from the November 1935 issue of the socialist magazine ''[[Common Sense (magazine)|Common Sense]]'':&lt;ref name=Schmidt231&gt;Schmidt, 1998, p. 231&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|I spent 33 years and four months in active military service and during that period I spent most of my time as a high class muscle man for Big Business, for [[Wall Street]] and the bankers. In short, I was a racketeer; a gangster for capitalism. I helped make Mexico and especially [[Tampico]] safe for American oil interests in 1914. I helped make Haiti and Cuba a decent place for the [[National City Bank of New York|National City Bank]] boys to collect revenues in. I helped in the raping of half a dozen Central American republics for the benefit of Wall Street. I helped purify [[Nicaragua]] for the International Banking House of [[Brown Brothers Harriman &amp; Co.|Brown Brothers]] in 1902–1912. I brought light to the Dominican Republic for the American sugar interests in 1916. I helped make [[Honduras]] right for the American fruit companies in 1903. In China in 1927 I helped see to it that [[Standard Oil]] went on its way unmolested. Looking back on it, I might have given [[Al Capone]] a few hints. The best he could do was to operate his racket in three districts. I operated on three continents.}}

===Business Plot===
{{Main|Business Plot}}

[[File:Universal Newsreel - Gen. Butler bares "plot" by fascists.ogv|thumb|Smedley Butler describes a political conspiracy to overthrow President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1933.]]
In November 1934, Butler claimed the existence of a [[Conspiracy (political)|political conspiracy]] by business leaders to overthrow President Roosevelt, a series of allegations that came to be known in the media as the [[Business Plot]].&lt;ref name="Schmidt224"&gt;Schmidt, 1998, p. 224&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;George Wolfskill, ''The Revolt of the Conservatives: A History of the American Liberty League, 1934–1940'' (Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1962), 85–91, 94–5&lt;/ref&gt; A special committee of the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] headed by Representatives [[John W. McCormack]] of [[Massachusetts]] and [[Samuel Dickstein (congressman)|Samuel Dickstein]] of New York, who was later alleged to have been a paid agent of the [[NKVD]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Weinstein |first=Allen |author2=Vassiliev, Alexander |authorlink=Allen Weinstein |title=The Haunted Wood: Soviet Espionage in America&amp;nbsp;– The Stalin Era |publisher=Modern Library |date=2000-03-14 |location=New York |pages=140–150 |isbn=978-0-375-75536-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; heard his testimony in secret.&lt;ref name=NYTNov21&gt;{{cite journal |journal=[[The New York Times]] |title=Gen. Butler Bares a 'Fascist Plot' |date=November 21, 1934 |page=1 |url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FB0D17FD3C5812738DDDA80A94D9415B848FF1D3&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=Butler&amp;st=p}}&lt;/ref&gt; The McCormack–Dickstein committee was a precursor to the [[House Committee on Un-American Activities]].

In November 1934, Butler told the committee that one Gerald P. MacGuire told him that a group of businessmen, supposedly backed by a private army of 500,000 ex-soldiers and others, intended to establish a fascist dictatorship. Butler had been asked to lead it, he said, by MacGuire, who was a bond salesman with [[Grayson M.P. Murphy|Grayson M–P Murphy]] &amp; Co. The ''New York Times'' reported that Butler had told friends that General [[Hugh S. Johnson]], former head of the [[National Recovery Administration]], was to be installed as dictator, and that the J.P. Morgan banking firm was behind the plot. Butler told Congress that MacGuire had told him the attempted coup was backed by three million dollars, and that the 500,000 men were probably to be assembled in Washington, D.C. the following year. All the parties alleged to be involved publicly said there was no truth in the story, calling it a joke and a fantasy.&lt;ref name=NYTNov21 /&gt;

In its report to the House, the committee stated that, while "no evidence was presented... to show a connection... with any fascist activity of any European country... [t]here was no question that these attempts were discussed, were planned, and might have been placed in execution..." and that "your committee was able to verify all the pertinent statements made by General Butler, with the exception of the direct statement about the creation of the organisation.  This, however, was corroborated in the correspondence of MacGuire with his principal, Robert Sterling Clark...."&lt;ref name="Archer2007"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Plot to Seize the White House|author="Archer, Jules|pages=192–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

No prosecutions or further investigations followed, and historians have questioned whether or not a coup was actually contemplated. Historians have not reported any independent evidence apart from Butler's report on what MacGuire told him. One of these, Hans Schmidt, says MacGuire was an "inconsequential trickster".&lt;ref name=burk&gt;Burk, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sargent&gt;Sargent, 1974, Vol. 8, Issue 1, pp. 151–2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Schmidt226"&gt;Schmidt, 1998, p. 226–7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schlesinger, 2003, p. 83&lt;/ref&gt; The news media dismissed the plot, with a ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' editorial characterizing it as a "gigantic hoax".&lt;ref name="nyt112234"&gt;{{cite news|title=Credulity Unlimited|date=November 22, 1934|work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the committee's final report was released, the ''Times'' said the committee "purported to report that a two-month investigation had convinced it that General Butler's story of a Fascist march on Washington was alarmingly true" and "... also alleged that definite proof had been found that the much publicized Fascist march on Washington, which was to have been led by Major Gen. Smedley D. Butler, retired, according to testimony at a hearing, was actually contemplated".&lt;ref name=time&gt;{{cite journal|title=Plot Without Plotters|journal=Time Magazine|date=December 3, 1934|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,929957,00.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The individuals involved all denied the existence of a plot, despite evidence to the contrary. Though the media ridiculed the allegations, a final report by a [[Business Plot|special House of Representatives Committee]] confirmed some of Butler's statements.&lt;ref name="Schmidt245"&gt;Schmidt, 1998, p. 245&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=n name="plot1"&gt;[[:File:Special Committee on Un-American Activities, Investigation of Nazi Propaganda Activities and Investigation of Certain Other Propaganda Activities 1.djvu|Investigation of Nazi Propaganda Activities and Investigation of Certain Other Propaganda Activities]]: Public Hearings Before the Special Committee on Un-American Activities, House of Representatives, Seventy-third Congress, Second Session, at Washington, D.C. pp.&amp;nbsp;8–114 D.C. 6 II&lt;/ref&gt;

The McCormack–Dickstein Committee said of Butler's testimony in its final report, "In the last few weeks of the committee's official life it received evidence showing that certain persons had made an attempt to establish a fascist organization in this country... There is no question that these attempts were discussed, were planned, and might have been placed in execution when and if the financial backers deemed it expedient."&lt;ref name="Schmidt245"/&gt;&lt;ref group=n name="plot1"/&gt;&lt;ref group=n name="HUAC"&gt;"HUAC's final report to Congress: "There is no question that these attempts were discussed, were planned, and might have been placed in execution when and if the financial backers deemed it expedient." The committee had verified "all the pertinent statements made by General Butler, with the exception of the direct statement suggesting the creation of the organization."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Upon his retirement, Butler bought a home in [[Newtown Square]], Pennsylvania, where he lived with his wife.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historicnewtownsquare.org/historical_sites/historic_site_details.asp?name=Smedley+Butler+House Smedley Butler House]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Newtown Square Historical Preservation Society. Accessed September 15, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1940, he checked himself into the hospital after becoming sick a few weeks earlier. His doctor described his illness as an incurable condition of the upper gastro-intestinal tract that was probably cancer. His family remained by his side, even bringing his new car so he could see it from the window. He never had a chance to drive it. On June 21, 1940, Smedley Butler died in the Naval Hospital in Philadelphia.&lt;ref name="Schmidt245"/&gt;

The funeral was held at his home, attended by friends and family as well as several politicians, members of the Philadelphia police force and officers of the Marine Corps.&lt;ref name=Schmidt246&gt;Schmidt, 1998, p. 246&lt;/ref&gt; He was buried at [[Oaklands Cemetery]] near West Chester, Pennsylvania.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Major General Smedley D. Butler, USMC |publisher=Oaklands Cemetery| year=2008 |url=http://www.oaklandscemetery.org/stop2.htm| accessdate=2010-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since his death in 1940, his family has maintained his home as it was when he died, including a large quantity of memorabilia he had collected throughout his varied career.&lt;ref name=Schmidt246 /&gt;

==Honors and awards==

===Military awards===
In addition to the Medal of Honor and his other American military decorations, Butler received several awards from other countries including the Haitian Médaille militaire and the French [[Order of the Black Star]].&lt;ref name="Lelle149"&gt;Lelle, 1988, p. 149&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Suryaprabha''' (literally "Sunlight", {{CJKV|r=Nikkō bosatsu|p=Rìguāng púsà|c=日光菩薩}}) is a [[bodhisattva]] whose specialty is sunlight and good health. Suryaprabha is often seen with [[Candraprabha]], as the two siblings serve [[Bhaisajyaguru]]. Statues of the two closely resemble each other and are commonly found together, sometimes flanking temple doors. They are also known in mainland Asia, but as [[Deva (Buddhism)|devas]] rather than bodhisattvas.

'''Teuku Jacob''' (6 December 1929 – 17 October 2007) was an [[Indonesia]]n [[paleoanthropologist]]. As a student of [[Gustav Heinrich Ralph von Koenigswald]] in the 1950s, Jacob claimed to have discovered and studied numerous specimens of ''[[Homo erectus]]''. He came to international prominence as a vocal critic of scientists who believed remains discovered in Flores belonged to a new species in the [[genus]] ''[[Homo]]'', ''[[Homo floresiensis]]''.

Jacob studied at [[Gadjah Mada University]]'s School of Medicine  from 1950 to 1956; [[University of Arizona]] from 1957 to 1958; [[Howard University]] from 1958 to 1960, and finally [[Utrecht University]], where he completed his [[doctorate]] in anthropology in 1967.&lt;ref name="jakarta"&gt;{{cite web | last=Wahyuni | first=Sri | title=The Professor's Biography  | url=http://www.andaman.org/BOOK/chapter49/text49.htm#biography | date=24 May 2003 | work= | publisher=[[Jakarta Post]] | accessdate=2009-05-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a young adult, Jacob actively participated in the [[Indonesian National Revolution]], producing a nationalist radio program. Following the [[Japanese occupation of Indonesia]] during [[World War II]], Jacob served in the Indonesian armed forces. From 1982 to 1987, Jacob was also a member of the [[People's Consultative Assembly]].&lt;ref name="wahyuni"&gt;{{cite web | last=Wahyuni | first=Sri | author2=A.

Jacob died in Dr. Sardjito Hospital at the age of 77 after suffering from a debilitating liver disease.&lt;ref name="wahyuni"/&gt;

==''Homo floresiensis''==
Jacob came to international prominence when he expressed his disagreement with scientists who claimed that remains found on the island of [[Flores]] constituted a new human species, labeled ''Homo floresiensis''. Jacob insisted that the remains were those of [[microcephalic]] modern humans. In early December 2004, Jacob removed most of the remains from Soejono's institution, [[Jakarta]]'s National Research Centre of Archaeology, for his own research without the permission of the Centre's directors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Steve |last=Connor|newspaper=New Zealand Herald |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/index.cfm?c_id=82&amp;ObjectID=8500998 | title=Hobbit woman' remains spark row among academics|date= 30 November 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |newspaper=New Scientist | url=https://www.newscientist.com/channel/being-human/mg18424772.900 | title=Fight over access to 'hobbit' bones – being-human | date=11 December 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=''Times Online''| url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,3-1386423,00.html|date= 3 December 2004 | title=Professor fuels row over Hobbit man fossils | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Jacob eventually returned the remains with portions severely damaged&lt;ref name="smh.com.au"&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=Sydney Morning Herald|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/Science/Hobbits-triumph-tempered-by-tragedy/2005/03/04/1109700677461.html|title=Hobbits triumph tempered by tragedy|date= 5 March 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and missing two leg bones on February 23, 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/23282/title/Flores-hominid-bones-returned/ | publisher=The Scientist|title=Flores hominid bones returned |date=28 February 2005|last=Powledge|first= Tabitha M.| accessdate=28 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reports noted the condition of the returned remains included "long, deep cuts marking the lower edge of the Hobbit's jaw on both sides, said to be caused by a knife used to cut away the rubber mould"; "the chin of a second Hobbit snapped off and glued back together. Whoever was responsible misaligned the pieces and put them at an incorrect angle"; and, "The pelvis was smashed, destroying details that reveal body shape, gait and evolutionary history".&lt;ref name="bbc-restart"&gt;{{cite news |publisher=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/6294101.stm |title=Hobbit cave digs set to restart |date= 25 January 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This prompted the discovery team leader Morwood to remark "It's sickening, Jacob was greedy and acted totally irresponsibly".&lt;ref name="smh.com.au"/&gt;

Jacob, however, denied any wrongdoing. He stated that such damage occurred during transport from [[Yogyakarta (city)|Yogyakarta]] back to Jakarta&lt;ref name="bbc-restart"/&gt; despite the physical evidence to the contrary that the jawbone had been broken while making a mold of bones.&lt;ref name="smh.com.au"/&gt;

In 2005 Indonesian officials forbade access to the cave and thus no other excavations in the place were possible. The [[BBC]] expressed the opinion that the reason for the restriction was to protect Jacob from being proven wrong. Scientists were allowed to return to the cave in 2007, the same year that Jacob died from liver disease.&lt;ref name="bbc-restart"/&gt;

'''Ulf Hohmann''' (born 9 July 1963 in [[Stuttgart]]) is a [[Germany|German]] [[Ethology|ethologist]], whose studies about the [[raccoon]] have played a significant role in the understanding of its [[social behavior]] and its distribution in Germany.

== Biography ==

Studying at the universities [[University of Tübingen]] and [[University of Kiel]], Ulf Hohmann completed his [[diploma]] of [[Biology]] in 1992.&lt;ref name="gwn"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gwn.de/gwn/html/ulfenglisch.html | title=Forum: Dr. Ulf Hohmann | accessdate=2008-07-26 | work=GWN-Homepage | publisher=Gesellschaft für Wildökologie und Naturschutz e.V.}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the submission of his [[dissertation]] to [[Antal Festetics]] at the forestal faculty of the [[University of Göttingen]] in 1998,&lt;ref name="gwn" /&gt; he was the chairperson of the ''Gesellschaft für Wildökologie und Naturschutz e.V.'' (''Society for wildlife ecology and conservation e.V.'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gwn.de/gwn/html/frame8.htm | title=Presseinfos  | accessdate=2008-07-26 | date=2001-04-20 | work=GWN-Homepage | publisher=Gesellschaft für Wildökologie und Naturschutz e.V. | language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this role, he appeared in the media as expert for the increasing urbanisation of animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gwn.de/gwn/html/publicationlist.html | title=Forum: Weitere Veröffentlichungen | accessdate=2008-07-26
 | work=GWN-Homepage | publisher=Gesellschaft für Wildökologie und Naturschutz e.V. | language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the moment (July 2008), he works for the ''Forschungsanstalt für Waldökologie und Forstwirtschaft Rheinland-Pfalz'' (''Research institute for forest ecology and forestry Rhineland-Palatinate'') located in [[Trippstadt]].&lt;ref name="fwf"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.wald-rlp.de/index.php?id=3124&amp;user_projects_pi1=21 | title=Hohmann, Dr. Ulf | accessdate=2008-07-26 | year=2005 | work=Landesforsten Rheinland-Pfalz | publisher=Landesforsten Rheinland-Pfalz | language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research ==

Within the scope of his dissertation, Ulf Hohmann and several scientific assistants carried out the first systematic study of the German raccoon population from 1992 to 1998.&lt;ref&gt;Hohmann (2001), p. 24–25&lt;/ref&gt; The [[telemetry|telemetric]] measurement of the movement patterns of the raccoons living in the [[Lower Saxony]] low mountain range [[Solling]] yielded the result that the social behavior of raccoons is gender-specific and that they often live together in small, loose groups instead of being [[loner]]s like previously thought.&lt;ref&gt;Hohmann (2001), p. 155&lt;/ref&gt; Stanley D. Gehrt arrived at the same conclusion in his study done in [[Texas]] in 1994 one year after Hohmann's initial query to Gehrt's doctoral adviser and raccoon expert Erik Fritzell about his discoveries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Gehrt | first=Stanley D. | title=Raccoon social organization in South Texas | year= 1994}} (Dissertation at the University of Missouri-Columbia)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hohmann (2001), p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; (→ [[Raccoon#Social_behavior|Social behavior of raccoons]])

The study was supplemented with the observation of the behavior of several raised and subsequently released raccoon kits.&lt;ref&gt;Hohmann (2001), p. 31–41&lt;/ref&gt; This work, started by the graduand Franziska Kalz in 1995,&lt;ref&gt;Hohmann (2001), p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; was accompanied by the [[Wildlife photography|wildlife photographer]] Ingo Bartussek since spring 1996.&lt;ref&gt;Hohmann (2001), p. 39&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in 1999, after the submission of his dissertation, Ulf Hohmann carried out the first study of urban raccoons outside of [[North America]] in the [[Hesse|Hessian]] small town [[Bad Karlshafen]].&lt;ref&gt;Hohmann (2001), p. 104–109&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, Ulf Hohmann published the [[monograph]] ''Der Waschbär'' (''The raccoon''), giving a thorough overview of appearance and behavior of the species and the results of his studies in it. Besides numerous photos of Ingo Bartussek, the book also contains a chapter about raising raccoon kits written by the [[veterinarian]] Bernhard Böer.

Working now for the ''Forschungsanstalt für Waldökologie und Forstwirtschaft Rheinland-Pfalz'', Ulf Hohmann has recently concentrated on the research of [[boar]]s, mainly of those living in the [[Palatinate Forest]].&lt;ref name="fwf" /&gt; His research on raccoons has been continued by Frank-Uwe Michler, who first worked together with Hohmann for his diploma in a study of urban raccoons in [[Kassel]] from 2001 to 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.diewaschbaerenkommen.de/html/kassel.html | title=Die Ergebnisse des Forschungsprojektes "Untersuchungen zur Ökologie urbaner Waschbär-Vorkommen am Beispiel der Stadt Kassel" | accessdate=2008-07-26 | last=Bartussek | first=Ingo | work=Die Waschbären kommen | language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since March 2006, Frank-Uwe Michler is the leader of the first study of the range and behavior of the raccoons living in the eastern parts of Germany in the [[Müritz National Park]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.projekt-waschbaer.de/kontakt-und-ansprechpartner/ | title=Projektleitung / Ansprechpartner | accessdate=2008-07-26 | last=Michler | first=Frank-Uwe |author2=Köhnemann, Berit A. | work=„Projekt Waschbär“ | publisher=Gesellschaft für Wildökologie und Naturschutz e.V. | language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Van Rensselaer family''' is a family of [[Dutch people|Dutch]] descent that was prominent during the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries in the area now known as the [[State of New York]]. Members of this family played a critical role in the formation of the United States and served as leaders in business, politics and society.

==History==
[[File:VanRensselaerFamilyCrest.png|thumb|The Van Rensselaer [[coat of arms]] originally had the Dutch motto ''niemand zonder'', meaning "no one without (a cross)".&lt;ref name="Rensselaer1888"&gt;{{cite book|author=Maunsell Van Rensselaer|title=Annals of the Van Rensselaers in the United States|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G1ITAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA214-IA1|accessdate=4 April 2018|year=1888|publisher=C. Van Benthuysen &amp; Sons|page=214}}&lt;/ref&gt; The modern motto is ''omnibus effulgemus'', [[Latin]] for "we shine for all".]]

The Van Rensselaers were of Dutch origin,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/GPO-STYLEMANUAL-2008/html/GPO-STYLEMANUAL-2008-5.htm U.S. Government Printing Office Style Manual]; Chapter 3 - Capitalization Rules; Rule 3.14: "In anglicized names such particles are usually capitalized...but individual usage...should be followed."&lt;/ref&gt; and the family originally migrated from the [[Netherlands]] to a large area along the [[Hudson River]] in the present-day area of [[Albany, New York]]. The Van Rensselaers and other [[patroon]]s named this young colony [[New Netherland]]. Many members of the family were active in politics and in the military.&lt;ref name="VRAnnals"&gt;Van Rensselaer, Maunsell (1888). [https://archive.org/details/annalsofvanrenss00vanr ''Annals of the Van Rensselaers in the United States, especially as they relate to the family of Killian K. Van Rensselaer''] C. Van Benthuysen &amp; Sons, p. 215&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bonney, Catharina V. R. (Catharina Van Rensselaer)(1875). [https://archive.org/details/legacyofhistoric01bonn ''Alegacy of Historical Gleanings''] J. Munsell&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Herman Melville]], a descendant of the Van Rensselaer family, mentioned them in the first chapter of his novel ''[[Moby-Dick]]'': "It touches one's sense of honor, particularly if you come of an old established family in the land, the Van Rensselaers, or [[Randolph family of Virginia|Randolphs]], or [[House of Knýtlinga|Hardicanutes]]." [[Edith Wharton]],  a  Van Rensselaer cousin, is said to have based the Van der Luydens in ''[[The Age of Innocence]]''  on the Van Rensselaers.

'''Émile "Mimile" Buisson''' (19 August 1902 – 28 February 1956) was a [[France|French]] [[gangster]],  and French [[public enemy]] No. 1 for 1950. A member of the French ''[[Gang des Tractions Avant]]'', Buisson was responsible for over thirty murders and a hundred robberies. Buisson was pursued and caught by French detective of the [[National Police (France)|Sûreté Nationale]] [[Roger Borniche]], and was executed in 1956 by the [[guillotine]]. Borniche's memoirs on the pursuit, ''[[Flic Story]]'', were later made into a film of the same name in 1975, with Buisson portrayed by [[Jean-Louis Trintignant]].

Buisson was born in [[Paray-le-Monial]], [[Saône-et-Loire]], and was jailed at the age of 16 for [[pickpocket]]ing, swindling and possessing an offensive weapon. He was exiled to [[Shanghai]] with his brother for 5 years. Upon returning to France, Buisson was involved in a number of crimes and murders, becoming a member of [[Paris]]' criminal organizations, and took part in a hold-up of [[Troyes]] in 1937. In 1941 Buisson killed a passenger on board a security van during a robbery, and was captured by police during an identity check. Buisson was regarded as criminally insane and was committed to a psychiatric hospital, only to escape in 1947 with the help of Roger Dekker. Becoming French [[public enemy]] No. 1 for 1950, Buisson was eventually captured by [[Roger Borniche]] and was executed on [[guillotine]] in 1956.
