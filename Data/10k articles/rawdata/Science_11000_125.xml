The '''''acentric''''' factor &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; is a conceptual number introduced by [[Kenneth Pitzer]] in 1955, proven to be very useful in the description of matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.e-education.psu.edu/png520/m8_p3.html | title = Acentric Factor and Corresponding States | accessdate = 2013-11-06 | last = Adewumi | first = Michael | publisher = Pennsylvania State University}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has become a standard for the phase characterization of single &amp; pure components. The other state description parameters are [[molecular weight]], [[critical temperature]], [[critical pressure]], and [[Critical point (thermodynamics)|critical volume]] (or critical compressibility).'''The acentric factor''' is said to be a measure of the non-sphericity (centricity) of molecules.&lt;ref name=thermopedia&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Saville | first1 = G. | doi = 10.1615/AtoZ.a.acentric_factor | chapter = ACENTRIC FACTOR | title = A-to-Z Guide to Thermodynamics, Heat and Mass Transfer, and Fluids Engineering | year = 2006 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; As it increases, the [[Vapor pressure|vapor curve]] is "pulled" down, resulting in higher [[boiling point]]s.

It is defined as:

:&lt;math&gt;\omega = - \log_{10} (p^{\rm{sat}}_r) - 1, {\rm \ at \ } T_r = 0.7&lt;/math&gt;.

where
&lt;math&gt;T_r = \frac{T}{T_c}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[reduced temperature]],
&lt;math&gt;p^{\rm{sat}}_r = \frac{p^{\rm{sat}}}{p_c}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[reduced pressure|reduced saturation vapor pressure]].

For many monatomic fluids
:&lt;math&gt;p_r^{\rm{sat}}{\rm \ at \ } T_r = 0.7&lt;/math&gt;,
is close to 0.1, therefore &lt;math&gt;\omega \to 0&lt;/math&gt;. In many cases, &lt;math&gt;T_r = 0.7&lt;/math&gt; lies above the [[normal boiling point|boiling temperature]] of liquids at atmosphere pressure.

Values of &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; can be determined for any fluid from accurate experimental vapor pressure data.  Preferably, these data should first be regressed against a reliable vapor pressure equation such as the following:

ln(P) = A + B/T +C*ln(T) + D*T^6

(This equation fits vapor pressure over a very wide range of temperature for most components, but is by no means the only one that should be considered.)  In this regression, a careful check for erroneous vapor pressure measurements must be made, preferably using a log(P) vs. 1/T graph, and any obviously incorrect or dubious values should be discarded.  The regression should then be re-run with the remaining good values until a good fit is obtained.  The vapor pressure at Tr=0.7 can then be used in the defining equation, above, to estimate acentric factor.

Then, using the known critical temperature, Tc, find the temperature at Tr = 0.7.  At this temperature, calculate the vapor pressure, Psat, from the regressed equation.

The definition of &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; gives a zero-value for the [[noble gas]]es [[argon]], [[krypton]], and [[xenon]]. &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; is very close to zero for other spherical molecules.&lt;ref name="thermopedia" /&gt;

By definition, a [[van der Waals equation|van der Waals fluid]] has a critical [[compressibility factor|compressibility]] of 3/8 and an acentric factor of about −0.302024, indicating a small ultra-spherical molecule. A [[Redlich-Kwong equation of state|Redlich-Kwong fluid]] has a critical compressibility of 1/3 and an acentric factor of about 0.058280, close to nitrogen; without the temperature dependence of its attractive term, its acentric factor would be only -0.293572.

'''Alexander Martin Lippisch''' (November 2, 1894 – February 11, 1976) was a German aeronautical engineer, a pioneer of [[aerodynamics]] who made important contributions to the understanding of [[tailless aircraft]], [[delta wing]]s and the [[ground effect in aircraft|ground effect]], and also worked in the U.S.  His most famous designs are the [[Messerschmitt Me 163]] rocket-powered interceptor&lt;ref name=Reitsch&gt;Reitsch, H., 1955, The Sky My Kingdom, London: Biddles Limited, Guildford and King's Lynn, {{ISBN|1853672629}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|174}} and the [[Dornier Aerodyne]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://discaircraft.greyfalcon.us/LIPPISCHE%20AERODYNE%20RESEARCH.htm discaircraft.greyfalcon.us]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Lippisch was born in [[Munich]], [[Kingdom of Bavaria]].  He later recalled that his interest in aviation began with a demonstration conducted by [[Wright Brothers|Orville Wright]] over [[Tempelhof International Airport|Tempelhof Field]] in [[Berlin]] in September 1909.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.centennialofflight.gov/essay/Wright_Bros/Military_Flyer/WR11G1.htm Wright Flyer over Templehoff] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051126020648/http://www.centennialofflight.gov/essay/Wright_Bros/Military_Flyer/WR11G1.htm |date=2005-11-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nonetheless, he planned to follow his father's footsteps into art school, until the outbreak of [[World War I]] intervened.  During his service with the German Army, between 1915–1918, Lippisch had the chance to fly as an aerial photographer and mapper.

==Early aircraft designs==
Following the war, Lippisch worked with the [[Luftschiffbau Zeppelin|Zeppelin Company]], and it was at this time that he first became interested in [[tailless aircraft]]. In 1921, his first design to be  built, by his friend [[Gottlob Espenlaub]], was the [[Espenlaub E-2]] glider. This was the beginning of a research programme that would result in some fifty designs throughout the 1920s and 1930s. Lippisch's growing reputation saw him appointed in 1925 as the director of the [[Rhön-Rossitten Gesellschaft]] (RRG), a glider organisation including research groups and construction facilities.

Lippisch also designed conventional gliders at this time, including the [[Lippisch Wien|Wien]] of 1927 and its successor the [[Lippisch Fafnir|Fafnir]] of 1930. In 1928, Lippisch's [[Canard (aeronautics)|tail-first]] [[Lippisch Ente|Ente]] (''Duck'') became the first aircraft to fly under [[rocket]] power.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} From 1927, he resumed his tailless work, leading to a series of designs named '''Storch I''' – '''Storch IX''' (Stork I-IX), mostly gliders. These designs attracted little interest from the government and private industry.

==Delta wing designs==
Experience with the Storch series led Lippisch to concentrate increasingly on [[delta wing|delta-winged]] designs. The '''Delta I''' was the world's first&lt;ref name=secret&gt;{{cite book|last=Ford|first=Roger|title=Germany's secret weapons in World War II|date=2000|publisher=MBI Publ.|location=Osceola, WI|isbn=0-7603-0847-0|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lU8xBhe9ntsC&amp;lpg=PA36&amp;dq=Lippisch&amp;pg=PA36#v=onepage&amp;q=Lippisch&amp;f=false|edition=1. publ.|page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; tailless delta wing aircraft to fly (in 1931&lt;ref name=Ducted&gt;{{cite book|title=Ducted Fan Design |edition=Revised|volume=1|pages=129–130|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YcAjcSSP4HMC&amp;pg=PA129&amp;dq=Lippisch+erste+delta#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|author=F. Marc de Piolenc|author2=George E. Wright Jr.|last-author-amp=yes|accessdate=13 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pop1931&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ESgDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA65&amp;dq=Popular+Mechanics+1931+curtiss&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=inUETaDeIKeJnAf06JnlDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwBTgU#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true "New Triangle Plane Is Tailless", December 1931, Popular Science] article and photo of Delta I at bottom of page 65&lt;/ref&gt;). This interest resulted in five aircraft, numbered Delta I – Delta V, which were built between 1931 and 1939.&lt;ref name=pop1931 /&gt; In 1933, RGG had been reorganised into the ''Deutsche Forschungsanstalt für Segelflug'' (German Institute for Sailplane Flight, ''DFS'') and the Delta IV and Delta V were designated as the [[DFS 39]] and [[DFS 40]] respectively.

==World War II projects==
In early 1939, the ''Reichsluftfahrtsministerium'' ([[Reich Air Ministry|RLM]], Reich Aviation Ministry) transferred Lippisch and his team to work at the [[Messerschmitt]] factory, in order to design a high-speed [[fighter aircraft]] around the rocket engines&lt;ref name=Ducted /&gt;  then under development by [[Hellmuth Walter]]. The team quickly adapted their most recent design, the [[DFS 194]], to rocket power, the first example successfully flying in early 1940. This successfully demonstrated the technology for what would become the [[Messerschmitt Me 163]] Komet.&lt;ref&gt;Lippisch, A.; ''The Delta Wing: History and Development'', Iowa State University 1981, page 45: "Let me stress, however that the ''DFS 194'' should in no way be regarded as a predecessor of the ''Me 163''. The ''Me 163-Delta IVd'' was derived directly from the ''Delta-IVc-DFS 39''."&lt;/ref&gt;

Although technically novel, the Komet did not prove to be a successful weapon and friction between Lippisch and Messerschmitt was frequent. In 1943, Lippisch transferred to Vienna's Aeronautical Research Institute (''Luftfahrtforschungsanstalt Wien'', ''LFW''), to concentrate on the problems of high-speed flight.&lt;ref name=Ducted /&gt; That same year, he was awarded a doctoral degree in engineering by the [[University of Heidelberg]].

[[Wind tunnel]] research in 1939 had suggested that the delta wing was a good choice for [[supersonic]] flight, and Lippisch set to work designing a supersonic, [[ramjet]]-powered fighter, the [[Lippisch P.13a]]. By the time the war ended, however, the project had only advanced as far as a development glider, the [[Lippisch DM-1|DM-1]].

==Postwar work in the United States==
Like many German scientists, Lippisch was taken to the United States after the war under [[Operation Paperclip]] at the [[White Sands Missile Range]].

===Convair===
Advances in [[jet engine|jet engine design]] were making Lippisch's ideas more practical, and [[Convair]] became interested in a hybrid ([[mixed power]]) jet/rocket design which they proposed as the F-92. In order to gain experience with the delta wing handling at high speeds, they first built a test aircraft, the 7002 which, on June 9, 1948, became the first jet-powered delta-wing aircraft to fly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Aviation week|volume=51|date=1949|publisher=McGraw-Hill Pub. Co.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=typQAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=%22first+delta-wing%22+Lippisch&amp;dq=%22first+delta-wing%22+Lippisch}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the U.S. Air Force lost interest in the F-92, the next test model 7003 was designated the [[XF-92A]]. This led Convair to proposing delta wing for most of their projects through the 1950s and into the 1960s, including the [[F-102 Delta Dagger]], [[F-106 Delta Dart]] and [[B-58 Hustler]].{{citation needed|date=May 2018|reason=Needs to explain Lippisch's involvement and cite source}}

===Ground effect aircraft===
From 1950–1964, Lippisch worked for the [[Collins Radio Company]] in [[Cedar Rapids, Iowa]], which had an aeronautical division.&lt;ref name=Ducted /&gt; It was during this time that his interest shifted toward [[Ground effect vehicle|ground effect craft]]. The results were an unconventional [[VTOL]] aircraft (eventually becoming the [[Dornier Aerodyne]]) and an aerofoil boat research seaplane [[Collins X-112|X-112]], flown in 1963. However, Lippisch contracted [[cancer]], and resigned from Collins.

When he recovered in 1966, he formed his own research company, [[Lippisch Research Corporation]], and attracted the interest of the West German government. Prototypes for both the aerodyne and the ground-effect craft [[RFB X-113]] (1970) then [[RFB X-114]] (1977) were built, but no further development was undertaken. The [[Mercury Marine|Kiekhaefer Mercury]] company was also interested in his ground-effect craft and successfully tested one of his designs as the Aeroskimmer, but also eventually lost interest.

==Death and Legacy==
Lippisch died in [[Cedar Rapids, Iowa|Cedar Rapids]] on February 11, 1976.&lt;ref name=Ducted /&gt; In 1985, he was inducted into the [[International Air &amp; Space Hall of Fame]] at the [[San Diego Air &amp; Space Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;Sprekelmeyer, Linda, editor.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8726">'''Argument technology''' is a sub-field of [[artificial intelligence]]. A few decades ago, philosophical theories of [[argument|arguments]] were leveraged to handle key computational challenges, such as modeling [[non-monotonic logic|non-monotonic]] reasoning and designing robust coordination protocols for [[multi-agent systems]]. This soon led to several theoretical breakthroughs, which, in turn, fostered the development of argument-based applications in a variety of domains, e.g., [[education]], [[healthcare]], [[policy making]], and [[risk management]]. As a result, argument technology is a thriving interdisciplinary enterprise with its own variety of sub-fields and methodologies.&lt;ref name="bex"&gt;Bex, Floris J., Floriana Grasso, Nancy Green, Fabio Paglieri, and Chris Reed.

The '''biological basis of personality''' is the collection of [[brain]] systems and mechanisms that underlie [[Personality|human personality]]. [[Neuroscience|Human neurobiology]], especially as it relates to [[complex traits]] and behaviors, is not well understood, but research into the [[Neuroanatomy|neuroanatomical]] and functional underpinnings of personality are an active field of research. [[Model organism|Animal models of behavior]], molecular biology, and [[Neuroimaging|brain imaging]] techniques have provided some insight into human personality, especially [[Trait theory|trait theories]].

Much of the current understanding of personality from a neurobiological perspective places an emphasis on the biochemistry of the behavioral systems of reward, motivation, and punishment. This has led to a few biologically based personality theories such as [[Hans Eysenck#Model of personality|Eysenck's three factor model of personality]], Grey's [[reinforcement sensitivity theory]] (RST), and [[Cloninger#Temperament and Character Inventory|Cloninger's model of personality]]. The [[Big Five personality traits|Big Five model of personality]] is not biologically based; yet some research in the differences in brain structures provided biological support also for this model.

==Defining personality in a biological context==
[[Personality]] can be defined as a set of characteristics or traits that drive individual differences in human behavior. From a biological perspective, these traits can be traced back to brain structures and neural mechanisms. However, this definition and theory of biological basis is not universally accepted. There are many conflicting theories of personality in the fields of [[psychology]], psychiatry, philosophy, and [[neuroscience]]. A few examples of this are the [[Nature versus nurture|nature vs. nurture]] debate and how the idea of a 'soul' fits into biological theories of personality.&lt;ref name="LeDoux"&gt;{{cite journal|last=LeDoux|first=J.|year=2003|title=The Self|journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences|volume=1001|issue=1|pages=295–304| pmid=14625368|doi=10.1196/annals.1279.017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of biology-based personality research==
[[File:Hans.Eysenck.jpg|thumbnail|Hans Eysenck]]
Since the time of the ancient Greeks, humankind has attempted to explain personality through spiritual beliefs, philosophy, and psychology. Historically, studies of personality have traditionally come from the social sciences and humanities, but in the past two decades neuroscience has begun to be more influential in the understanding of human personality.&lt;ref name=Davidson&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Davidson | first1 = R. J. | year = 2001 | title = Toward a biology of personality and emotion | url = http://www.cogsci.bme.hu/DoCS/oktatas/kurzusok/olvasoszeminarium/2003/towardabiology.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Ann N Y Acad Sci | volume = 935 | issue = | pages = 191–207 | doi = 10.1111/j.1749-6632.2001.tb03481.x }}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the most cited and influential figures in publishing the first biology-based personality theories are [[Hans Eysenck]] and [[Jeffrey Alan Gray]]. Eysenck used both behavioral and [[Psychophysiology|psychophysiological]] methodologies to test and develop his theories.&lt;ref name="CorrPerkins2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Corr|first1=Philip J.|last2=Perkins|first2=Adam M.|title=The role of theory in the psychophysiology of personality: From Ivan Pavlov to Jeffrey Gray|journal=International Journal of Psychophysiology|volume=62|issue=3|year=2006|pages=367–376|issn=0167-8760|doi=10.1016/j.ijpsycho.2006.01.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He published a book in 1947 called ''Dimensions of Personality'', describing the personality dimensions of Extraversion and Neuroticism. Gray, a student of Eysenck, studied personality traits as individual differences in sensitivity to rewarding and punishing stimuli.&lt;ref name=CorrPerkins2006 /&gt; The significance of Gray's work and theories was his use of biology to define behavior, which stimulated a lot of subsequent research.&lt;ref name="Fowles"&gt;{{cite book |last=Fowles |first=Don |editor-first=Turhan |editor-last=Canli |title= Biology of personality and individual differences|publisher=Guilford Press |year=2006 |chapter=Chapter 2: Jeffrey Gray's Contributions to Theories of Anxiety, Personality, and Psychopathology|isbn=1593852525}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1951, [[Hans Eysenck]] and [[Donald Prell]] published an experiment in which [[twins|identical (monozygotic) and fraternal (dizygotic) twins]], ages 11 and 12, were tested for neuroticism. It is described in detail in an article published in the ''[[Journal of Mental Science]]''. in which Eysenck and Prell concluded that, "The factor of neuroticism is not a statistical artifact, but constitutes a biological unit which is inherited as a whole....neurotic [[Genetic predisposition|predisposition is to a large extent hereditarily determined]]."&lt;ref&gt;''The Journal of Mental Health'', July 1951, Vol. XCVII, "The Inheritance of Neuroticism: An Experimental Study", H. J. Eysenck and D. B. Prell, p. 402.&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of biology-based personality research is relatively new, but growing in interest and number of publications.&lt;ref name="Canli5"&gt;{{cite book |last=Canli |first=Turhan |editor-first=Turhan |editor-last=Canli |title= Biology of personality and individual differences|publisher=Guilford Press |year=2006 |chapter=Chapter 5: Genomic Imaging of Extraversion|isbn=1593852525}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2004, there was a conference specifically on the topic, called ''The Biological Basis of Personality and Individual Differences''.&lt;ref name="Canli"&gt;{{cite book |last=Canli |first=Turhan |editor-first=Turhan |editor-last=Canli |title= Biology of personality and individual differences|publisher=Guilford Press |year=2006 |chapter=Chapter 1: Introduction|isbn=1593852525}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This allowed for presenting and sharing of ideas between psychologists, psychiatrists, molecular geneticists, and neuroscientists, and eventually gave birth to the book under the same title.&lt;ref name=Canli /&gt; The book is a collection of current research (as of 2006) in the field contributed by many authors and edited by Turhan Canli. Recently, psychology professor Colin G. DeYoung has even named the idea as the field of 'Personality Neuroscience'.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

==Experimental techniques==
There are many experimental techniques for measuring the biology of the brain, but there are five main methods used to investigate the biological basis of personality.&lt;ref name="DeYoung2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=DeYoung|first1=Colin G.|title=Personality Neuroscience and the Biology of Traits|journal=Social and Personality Psychology Compass|volume=4|issue=12|year=2010|pages=1165–1180|issn=1751-9004|doi=10.1111/j.1751-9004.2010.00327.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The biological data from these methods are commonly correlated with personality traits. These personality traits are often determined by personality questionnaires. However, personality questionnaires may be biased because they are self-reported. As a result, scientists emphasize using several different measures of personality,&lt;ref name=DeYoung2010 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Zuckerman"&gt;{{cite book |last=Zuckerman |first=Marvin |editor-first=Turhan |editor-last=Canli |title= Biology of personality and individual differences|publisher=Guilford Press |year=2006 |chapter=Chapter 3: Biosocial Bases of Sensation Seeking|isbn=1593852525}}.&lt;/ref&gt; rather than solely self-reported measures of personality. For example, another measure of personality traits is observation of behavior. Both humans and animals have been observed to measure personality traits, but animals are particularly useful for studying the long-term behavioral-biological relationship of personality.&lt;ref name="Mehta and Gosling"&gt;{{cite book |last=Mehta |first=Pranjal |last2=Gosling |first2=Samuel |editor-first=Turhan |editor-last=Canli |title= Biology of personality and individual differences|publisher=Guilford Press |year=2006 |chapter=Chapter 20: How Can Animal Studies Contribute to Research on the Biological Bases of Personality|isbn=1593852525}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another interesting method that has become more sophisticated and affordable to researchers is the method of whole genome expression analysis. This method involves collecting data for a large number of genes simultaneously which provides many advantages in studying personality. In an article written by Alison M. Bell and Nadia Aubin-Horth, they describe the advantages very clearly by stating, "For one, it is probable that the genetic basis of personality is polygenic, so it makes sense to simultaneously study many genes. In addition, gene products rarely act alone. Instead, they perform their function by interacting together in pathways and networks. As a result, the molecular changes that characterize a phenotype are frequently not based on a single marker or gene, but rather on an entire pathway. Whole genome expression profiling therefore has the potential to reveal new candidates genes and pathways."&lt;ref&gt;Bell, A.M., &amp; Aubin-Horth, N. (2010).

==Genetic and molecular correlations to personality==
===Neurotransmitters ===
[[File:Pubmed equitativa hormonal.png|thumb|Dopamine and Serotonin pathways]]
The biology-based personality theories (discussed below) are based on correlating personality traits with behavioral systems related to motivation, reward, and punishment. On a broad level, this involves the autonomic nervous system, fear-processing circuits in the [[amygdala]], the reward pathway from the [[ventral tegmental area]] (VTA) to the [[nucleus accumbens]] and prefrontal cortex. All of these circuits heavily rely on neurotransmitters and their precursors, but there has been the most research support for dopamine and serotonin pathways:

*[[Dopamine]]: Dopamine is a [[monoamine neurotransmitter]] that has been found to promote exploratory behavior.&lt;ref name = "Ebstein" /&gt; Dopaminergic pathways have been specifically correlated with the extraversion trait of the Five Factor Model of Personality.&lt;ref name=DeYoung2010 /&gt; The [[monoamine oxidase]] (MAO) enzyme has a preferential affinity for dopamine, and its levels are inversely correlated with sensation seeking.&lt;ref name=Zuckerman /&gt;
*[[Serotonin]]: Serotonin is a [[monoamine neurotransmitter]], and has been found to promote avoidance behavior through inhibitory pathways.&lt;ref name = "Ebstein"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ebstein | first1 = Richard P. | last2 = Auerbach | first2 = Judith G. | year = 2002 | title = Dopamine D4 receptor and serotonin transporter promoter polymorphisms and temperament in early childhood | url = | journal = Molecular Genetics and the Human Personality | volume = | issue = | pages = 137–149 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, serotonin has been associated with Neuroticism, Agreeableness, and Conscientiousness (traits defined by the Five Factor Model of Personality).&lt;ref name=DeYoung2010 /&gt;

===Genes===
Previous studies show that genes account for at most 50 percent of a given trait.&lt;ref name=LeDoux /&gt; However, it is widely accepted that variance in gene sequence affect behavior, and genes are a significant risk factor for [[personality disorder]]s.&lt;ref name=Whittle&gt;Whittle, S., Allen, N. B., Lubman, D. I., &amp; Yucel, M. (2006). Neurobiological basis of temperament: Towards a better understanding of psychopathology. Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews, 30(4), 511-525.&lt;/ref&gt; With the growing interest in using molecular genetics in tracing the biological basis of personality,&lt;ref name=Canli /&gt; there may be more gene-trait links found in the future.

Varying [[polymorphism (biology)|polymorphism]]s and sequence repeats in the gene for [[dopamine receptor D4]] and serotonin transporter gene [[5-HTTLPR]], have both been found to influence the extraversion trait in adults. Specifically, study participants with at least one copy of the 7-repeat variant of the dopamine receptor D4 gene had higher scores of self-reported extraversion.&lt;ref name=Canli /&gt; This suggests that dopamine and serotonin interact to regulate the conflicting behavioral traits of careless exploration vs. cautious inhibition.&lt;ref name = "Ebstein"/&gt;

=== Synaptic plasticity ===
[[Synaptic plasticity]] refers to the ability of neurons to strengthen or weaken the connections between them. According to [[Hebbian theory]], these connections are strengthened and maintained through repeated stimulation between neurons. Specifically, there is an emphasis on [[long-term potentiation]] (LTP), which is the prolonged strengthening of synaptic connections that facilitate learning from experience.

On a larger scale, there are many pathways and brain regions that are interdependent and contribute to a cohesive, stable personality. For example, the amygdala and [[hippocampus]] of the [[limbic system]] mediate emotional intensity and consolidate memory of these experiences. But the basic mechanism by which these pathways and brain regions perform these functions, is synaptic plasticity. Ultimately, it boils down to this feature of neurons that allows the brain to learn from repeated experiences, retain memories, and ultimately maintain personality.&lt;ref name = LeDoux2&gt;LeDoux, J. E. (2003). Synaptic Self: How Our Brains Become Who We Are: Penguin Books.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joseph E. LeDoux|Joseph LeDoux]], an award-winning neuroscientist, asserts that although humans share the same brain systems, it is the unique wiring of neurons that is different in each person and makes their personality.&lt;ref name = LeDoux2/&gt;

==Personality theories with biological basis==
There are many theories of personality that on the identification of a set of traits that encompass human personality. Few however, are biologically based. This section will describe some theories of personality that have a biological basis. Additionally, it will present biological support for a popular non-biologically based personality theory, the Five Factor Model.

===Eysenck's three-factor model of personality===
Eysenck's three-factor model of personality was a causal theory of personality based on activation of [[reticular formation]] and [[limbic system]]. The reticular formation is a region in the [[brainstem]] that is involved in mediating arousal and consciousness. The limbic system is involved in mediating emotion, behavior, motivation, and long-term memory. 
# [[Extraversion]] (E) – degree to which people are outgoing and are interactive with people, which is mediated by the activation of the reticular formation.
# [[Neuroticism]] (N) – degree of emotional instability, which is associated with the limbic system.
# [[Psychoticism]] (P) – degree of aggression and interpersonal hostility.

===Gray's reinforcement sensitivity theory===
Gray's [[reinforcement sensitivity theory]] (RST) is based on the idea that there are three brain systems that all differently respond to rewarding and punishing stimuli.&lt;ref name=CorrPerkins2006 /&gt; 
# [[Fight-or-flight response|Fight-flight-freeze system]] (FFFS) – mediates the emotion of fear (not anxiety) and active avoidance of dangerous situations. The personality traits associated with this system is fear-proneness and avoidance.
# [[Behavioral inhibition system]] (BIS) – mediates the emotion of anxiety and cautious risk-assessment behavior when entering dangerous situations due to conflicting goals. The personality traits associated with this system is worry-proneness and anxiety.
# [[Behavioral approach system]] (BAS) – mediates the emotion of 'anticipatory pleasure,' resulting from reactions to desirable stimuli. The personality traits associated with this system are optimism, reward-orientation, and impulsivity.

[[Image:Cloninger Model.jpg|thumb|200px| Cloninger's biological dimensions of personality]]

===Cloninger model of personality===
{{anchor|Cloninger Model of Personality}}
This model of personality is based on the idea that different responses to punishing, rewarding, and novel stimuli the main characteristics of the human mind is caused by an interaction of the three dimensions below:
# [[Novelty Seeking]] (NS) – degree to which people are impulsive, correlated with low [[dopamine]] activity.
# [[Harm Avoidance]] (HA) – degree to which people are anxious, correlated with high [[serotonin]] activity.
# [[Reward Dependence]] (RD) – degree to which people are approval seeking, correlated with low [[norepinephrine]] activity.

In one MRI study,&lt;ref name="GardiniCloninger2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gardini|first1=Simona|last2=Cloninger|first2=C. Robert|last3=Venneri|first3=Annalena|title=Individual differences in personality traits reflect structural variance in specific brain regions|journal=Brain Research Bulletin|volume=79|issue=5|year=2009|pages=265–270|issn=0361-9230|doi=10.1016/j.brainresbull.2009.03.005|pmid=19480986}}&lt;/ref&gt; Novelty Seeking correlated with increased [[grey matter]] volume in regions of the [[cingulate cortex]], Harm Avoidance correlated with decreased grey matter volume in the orbitofrontal, occipital, and parietal cortex. Reward Dependence correlated with decreased grey matter volume in the [[caudate nucleus]].

===Five factor model of personality===
The [[five factor model]] is a widely used personality assessment that describes five core traits that a person possesses:
# [[Openness]] – degree to which people enjoy experiencing new stimuli
# [[Conscientiousness]] – degree to which people are dutiful and goal-oriented
# [[Extraversion]] – degree to which people seek stimuli outside of themselves
# [[Agreeableness]] – degree to which people aim to cooperate and please others
# [[Neuroticism]] – degree to which people are emotionally unstable

Using an MRI, one study&lt;ref name="DeYoung"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = DeYoung | first1 = C. G. | last2 = Hirsh | first2 = J. B. | last3 = Shane | first3 = M. S. | last4 = Papademetris | first4 = X. | last5 = Rajeevan | first5 = N. | last6 = Gray | first6 = J.

Their results found that Openness/Intellect did not have any significant correlation with the volume of any brain structures. Conscientiousness was associated with increased volume in the lateral [[prefrontal cortex]], a region involved in planning and the voluntary control of behavior. Extraversion was associated with increased volume of medial [[orbitofrontal cortex]], a region involved in processing reward information. Agreeableness was associated with increased volume in regions that process information about the intentions and mental states of other individuals. Neuroticism was associated with increased volume of brain regions associated with threat, punishment, and negative emotions.

'''Boydell Glacier''' ({{Coord|64|11|S|59|4|W|source:GNIS|display=inline,title}}) is a [[glacier]] on [[Trinity Peninsula]] in northern [[Graham Land]]. It is about {{convert|9|mi}} long, flowing southeastward from [[Detroit Plateau]] to enter [[Sjögren Inlet]] in [[Prince Gustav Channel]] north of the [[glacier terminus|terminus]] of [[Sjögren Glacier]] and {{convert|6|mi|0}} west of [[Mount Wild (Graham Land)|Mount Wild]]. It was mapped by the [[Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey]] from surveys (1960–61), and named by the [[UK Antarctic Place-Names Committee]] for [[James Boydell]], English inventor of a [[steam traction engine]], the first practical [[Continuous track|track-laying vehicle]].

In radiological physics, '''charged-particle equilibrium''' (CPE) occurs when the number of [[charged particle]]s leaving a volume is equal to the number entering, for each energy and type of particle.  When CPE exists in an irradiated medium, the [[absorbed dose]] in the volume is equal to the collision [[Kerma (physics)|kerma]]. 

In order for this to occur, energy is needed.

The '''clientele effect''' is the idea that the set of [[investor]]s attracted to a particular kind of [[Security (finance)|security]] will affect the [[Share price|price]] of the security when policies or circumstances change.
For instance, some investors want a company that doesn't pay dividends but instead invests that money in growing the business, whereas other investors prefer a stock that pays a high dividend, and still others want one that balances payout and reinvestment. If a company changes its [[dividend policy]] substantially, it is said to be subject to a clientele effect as some of its investors (its established clientele) decide to sell the security due to the change.  Although commonly used in reference to dividend or coupon (interest) rates, it can also be used in the context of leverage (debt levels), changes in line of business, taxes, and other aspects of the company.

The '''DARPA Grand Challenge''' is a prize competition for American [[vehicle automation|autonomous vehicle]]s, funded by the [[Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency]], the most prominent research organization of the United States [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]]. [[United States Congress|Congress]] has authorized DARPA to award cash prizes to further DARPA's mission to sponsor revolutionary, high-payoff research that bridges the gap between fundamental discoveries and military use. The initial DARPA Grand Challenge was created to spur the development of technologies needed to create the first fully [[vehicle automation|autonomous ground vehicle]]s capable of completing a substantial off-road course within a limited time. The third event, the [[DARPA Grand Challenge (2007)|DARPA Urban Challenge]] extended the initial Challenge to autonomous operation in a mock urban environment.  The most recent Challenge, the 2012 [[DARPA Robotics Challenge]], focused on autonomous emergency-maintenance robots.

==History and background==
{{See also|History of autonomous cars|l1=History of autonomous cars}}

Fully autonomous vehicles have been an international pursuit for many years, from endeavors in Japan (starting in 1977), Germany ([[Ernst Dickmanns]] and [[VaMP]]), Italy (the ARGO Project), the European Union ([[EUREKA Prometheus Project]]), the United States of America, and other countries. DARPA funded the development of the first fully autonomous robot beginning in 1966 with the [[Shakey the robot]] project at [[SRI International|Stanford Research Institute]], now SRI International. The first autonomous ground vehicle capable of driving on and off roads was developed by DARPA as part of the [[Strategic Computing Initiative]] beginning in 1984 leading to demonstrations of autonomous navigation by the Autonomous Land Vehicle and the [[Navlab]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ieeetv.ieee.org/history/robotics-history-narratives-and-networks-oral-histories-chuck-thorpe|title=Robotics History: Narratives and Networks Oral Histories: Chuck Thorpe|website=IEEE.tv|access-date=2018-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Grand Challenge was the first long distance competition for driverless cars in the world; other research efforts in the field of [[driverless car]]s take a more traditional commercial or academic approach. The U.S. Congress authorized DARPA to offer prize money ($1 million) for the first Grand Challenge to facilitate robotic development, with the ultimate goal of making one-third of ground military forces autonomous by 2015. Following the 2004 event, Dr. [[Tony Tether]], the director of DARPA, announced that the prize money had been increased to [[United States dollars|$]]2 million for the next event, which was claimed on October 9, 2005. The first, second and third places in the 2007 Urban Challenge received [[United States dollars|$]]2 million, [[United States dollars|$]]1 million, and [[United States dollars|$]]500,000, respectively.

The competition was open to teams and organizations from around the world, as long as there were at least one U.S. citizen on the roster. Teams have participated from high schools, universities, businesses and other organizations. More than 100 teams registered in the first year, bringing a wide variety of technological skills to the race. In the second year, 195 teams from 36 [[U.S. state]]s and 4 foreign countries entered the race.

==2004 Grand Challenge==
{{Main|DARPA Grand Challenge (2004)}}

The  first competition of the DARPA Grand Challenge was held on March 13, 2004 in the [[Mojave Desert]] region of the United States, along a {{convert|150|mi|km|adj=on}} route that follows along the path of [[Interstate 15]] from just before [[Barstow, California]] to just past the [[California]]&amp;ndash;[[Nevada]] border in [[Primm, Nevada|Primm]].
None of the robot vehicles finished the route. [[Carnegie Mellon University]]'s Red Team and car [[Sandstorm (vehicle)|Sandstorm]] (a converted Humvee) traveled the farthest distance, completing {{convert|11.78|km|mi|abbr=on}} of the course before getting hung up on a rock after making a switchback turn. No winner was declared, and the cash prize was not given. Therefore, a second DARPA Grand Challenge event was scheduled for 2005.

==2005 Grand Challenge==
{{Main|DARPA Grand Challenge (2005)}}

The second competition of the DARPA Grand Challenge began at 6:40am on October 8, 2005.   All but one of the 23 finalists in the 2005 race surpassed the {{convert|11.78|km|mi|abbr=on}} distance completed by the best vehicle in the 2004 race.  Five  vehicles successfully completed the 212&amp;nbsp;km (132&amp;nbsp;mi) course:

Vehicles in the 2005 race passed through three narrow tunnels and negotiated more than 100 sharp left and right turns.  The race concluded through Beer Bottle Pass, a winding mountain pass with a sheer drop-off on one side and a rock face on the other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first= |last= |coauthors= |title=DARPA Grand Challenge Winner: Stanley the Robot!|work = |publisher=[[Popular Mechanics]]|date= |accessdate=12 April 2010 |url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/engineering/robots/2169012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although the 2004 course required more elevation gain and some very sharp switchbacks (Daggett Ridge) were required near the beginning of the route, the course had far fewer curves and generally wider roads than the 2005 course.

[[Image:elementBlack2.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A vehicle that was developed for the 2007 DARPA Urban Challenge]]
The natural rivalry between the teams from [[Stanford]] and [[Carnegie Mellon]] ([[Sebastian Thrun]], head of the Stanford team was previously a faculty member at Carnegie Mellon and colleague of [[Red Whittaker]], head of the CMU team) was played out during the race.  Mechanical problems plagued H1ghlander before it was passed by Stanley.  Gray Team's entry was a miracle in itself, as the team from the suburbs of New Orleans was caught in [[Hurricane Katrina]] a few short weeks before the race.  The fifth finisher, Terramax, a 30,000 pound entry from [[Oshkosh Truck]], finished on the second day.  The huge truck spent the night idling on the course, but was particularly nimble in carefully picking its way down the narrow roads of Beer Bottle Pass.

The third competition of the DARPA Grand Challenge,&lt;ref&gt;"The contest, called the Grand Challenge and sponsored by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or Darpa, featured both robot collisions and robot traffic jams." {{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/05/technology/05robot.html|title=Crashes and Traffic Jams in Military Test of Robotic Vehicles|author=John Markoff|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=2007-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; known as the "Urban Challenge", took place on November 3, 2007 at the site of the now-closed [[George Air Force Base]] (currently used as [[Southern California Logistics Airport]]), in [[Victorville, California]] ([https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=victorville&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=34.590718,-117.374325&amp;spn=0.033527,0.035877&amp;t=k&amp;z=15&amp;om=1 Google map]).&lt;ref name="UrbanChallenge"&gt;[http://archive.darpa.mil/grandchallenge/index.asp Urban Challenge 2008 Archive] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120803132113/http://archive.darpa.mil/grandchallenge/index.asp |date=2012-08-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The course involved a {{convert|96|km|mi|abbr=on}} urban area course, to be completed in less than 6 hours.  Rules  included obeying all traffic regulations while negotiating with other traffic and obstacles and merging into traffic.

Unlike previous challenges, the 2007 Urban Challenge organizers divided competitors into two "tracks," A and B. All Track A and Track B teams were part of the same competition circuit, but the teams chosen for the Track A program received US $1 million in funding. These 11 teams largely represented major universities and large corporate interests such as [[Carnegie Mellon|CMU]] teaming with [[General Motors|GM]] as Tartan Racing, [[Stanford]] teaming with [[Volkswagen]], Virginia Tech teaming with [[TORC Technologies]] as VictorTango, [[Oshkosh Truck]], [[Honeywell]], [[Raytheon]], [[Caltech]], [[Autonomous Solutions]], [[Cornell]], and [[MIT]]. One of the few independent entries in Track A was [http://www.golemgroup.com  the Golem Group]. DARPA has not publicly explained the rationale behind the selection of Track A teams.

Teams were given maps sparsely charting the waypoints that defined the competition courses. At least one team, Tartan Racing, enhanced the maps through the insertion of additional extrapolated waypoints for improved navigation. A debriefing paper published by Team Jefferson illustrates graphically the contrast between the course map it was given by DARPA and the course map used by Tartan Racing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://teamjefferson.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Debrief-Complete-TeamJefferson-DRAFT.pdf |title=Team Jefferson 2007 DARPA Urban Challenge Debrief |publisher=Team Jefferson |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150211202449/http://teamjefferson.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Debrief-Complete-TeamJefferson-DRAFT.pdf |archivedate=2015-02-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tartan Racing claimed the $2 million prize with their vehicle "Boss", a Chevy Tahoe.  The second-place finisher earning the $1 million prize was the Stanford Racing Team with their entry "Junior", a 2006 Volkswagen Passat.  Coming in third place was team VictorTango, winning the $500,000 prize with their 2005 Ford Escape hybrid, "Odin".&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.darpa.mil/grandchallenge/index.asp Urban Challenge — Archived as of April 2008 ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120803132113/http://archive.darpa.mil/grandchallenge/index.asp |date=2012-08-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] placed 4th, with [[Cornell University]] and [[University of Pennsylvania]]/[[Lehigh University]] also completing the course.

While the 2004 and 2005 events were more physically challenging for the [[vehicle]]s, the robots operated in isolation and only encountered other vehicles on the course when attempting to pass.  The Urban Challenge required designers to build vehicles able to obey all traffic laws while they detect and avoid other robots on the course.  This is a particular challenge for vehicle [[software]], as vehicles must make "intelligent" decisions in real time based on the actions of other vehicles. Other than previous autonomous vehicle efforts that focused on structured situations such as highway driving with little interaction between the vehicles, this competition operated in a more cluttered urban environment and required the cars to perform sophisticated interactions with each other, such as maintaining precedence at a 4-way stop intersection.&lt;ref&gt;http://archive.darpa.mil/grandchallenge/docs/PR_UC_Announce_Update_12_06.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==2012 Robotics Challenge==
{{update|section|date=July 2017}}
{{Main|DARPA Robotics Challenge}}
The DARPA Robotics Challenge is an ongoing competition focusing on humanoid robotics. The primary goal of the program is to develop ground robotic capabilities to execute complex tasks in dangerous, degraded, human-engineered environments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.darpa.mil/Our_Work/TTO/Programs/DARPA_Robotics_Challenge.aspx DARPA ROBOTICS CHALLENGE (DRC)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130120060850/http://www.darpa.mil/Our_Work/TTO/Programs/DARPA_Robotics_Challenge.aspx |date=2013-01-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It launched in October 2012, and hosted the Virtual Robotics Competition in June 2013. Two more competitions are planned: the DRC Trials in December 2013, and the DRC Finals in December 2014.

Unlike prior Challenges, the construction of the "vehicles" will not be part of the scope of the Robotics Challenge.  In August 2012 DARPA announced [[Boston Dynamics]] would act as sole source for the robots to be used in the challenge, awarding them a contract to develop and build 8 identical robots based on the [[Boston Dynamics#PETMAN|PETMAN]] project for the software teams to use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&amp;mode=form&amp;id=1a693d7823dcc435068066b4637c516a&amp;tab=core&amp;_cview=0|title=Sole Source Intent Notice for Humanoid Robot Systems for the DARPA Robotics Challenge Program - Federal Business Opportunities: Opportunities|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The amount contracted was $10,882,438 cost-plus-fixed-fee contract and work is expected to be completed by Aug. 9, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.defense.gov/contracts/contract.aspx?contractid=4853|title=Defense.gov: Contracts for Monday, August 13, 2012|publisher=|accessdate=19 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2013 FANG Challenge==
On April 22, 2013, DARPA awarded a $1 million prize to "Ground Systems", a 3-person team with members in Ohio, Texas and California, as the winner of the [[Adaptive Vehicle Make|Fast Adaptable Next-Generation Ground Vehicle]] (FANG) Mobility/Drivetrain Challenge.  Team Ground Systems' final design submission received the highest score when measured against the established requirements for system performance and manufacturability. Since the beginning of the first FANG Challenge on January 14, 2013, more than 1,000 participants within more than 200 teams used the [[Adaptive Vehicle Make|META]] design tools and the [[Adaptive Vehicle Make|VehicleFORGE]] collaboration platform developed by [[Vanderbilt University]] in [[Nashville]], [[Tennessee]], to design and simulate the performance of thousands of potential mobility and drivetrain subsystems. The goal of the FANG program is to test the specially developed META design tools, model libraries and the VehicleFORGE platform, which were created to significantly compress the design-to-production time of a complex defense system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.darpa.mil/NewsEvents/Releases/2013/04/22.aspx DARPA Announces Winner of the First FANG Challenge, April 22, 2013] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140403223256/http://www.darpa.mil/NewsEvents/Releases/2013/04/22.aspx |date=April 3, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brewster published a detailed biography of Newton in 1831 and later became the first scientific historian to examine many of the papers in Newton's ''[[Nachlass]]''.

He became the public face of higher education in Scotland, serving as [[Principal (academia)|Principal]] of the [[University of St Andrews]] (1837–59) and later of the [[University of Edinburgh]] (1859–68). Brewster also edited the 18-volume ''[[Edinburgh Encyclopædia]]''.

==Early life==
David Brewster was born at the Canongate in [[Jedburgh]], [[Roxburghshire]], to Margaret Key (1753–1790) and James Brewster (c. 1735–1815), the [[Rector (education)|rector]] of [[Jedburgh Grammar School]] and a teacher of high reputation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gordon |first1=Margaret Maria |title=The home life of Sir David Brewster |date=1881 |publisher=D. Douglas |location=Edinburgh |edition=3rd |url=https://archive.org/stream/homelifeofsirdav00gord#page/n5 |accessdate=18 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; David was the third of six children, two daughters and four sons: James (1777–1847), minister at Craig, Ferryden; David; George (1784–1855), minister at Scoonie, Fife; and Patrick (1788–1859), minister at the abbey church, Paisley.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt;

At the age of 12, David was sent to the [[University of Edinburgh]] (graduating [[MA (Scotland)|MA]] in 1800), being intended for the clergy. He was licensed a [[minister of the Church of Scotland]], and preached around Edinburgh on several occasions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Wylie |first1=James Aitken |title=Disruption worthies : a memorial of 1843, with an historical sketch of the free church of Scotland from 1843 down to the present time |date=1881 |publisher=T. C. Jack |location=Edinburgh |pages=59–64 |url=https://archive.org/stream/disruptionworthi00wyli#page/n201 |accessdate=18 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had already shown a strong inclination for [[natural science]], and this had been fostered by his intimacy with a "[[self-taught]] philosopher, [[astronomy|astronomer]] and [[mathematics|mathematician]]", as Sir [[Walter Scott]] called him, of great local fame, James Veitch of [[Jedburgh|Inchbonny]], a man who was particularly skilful in making [[telescope]]s.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

==Career==

===Work on optics===
Though Brewster duly finished his [[theology|theological]] studies and was licensed to preach, his other interests distracted him from the duties of his profession. In 1799 fellow-student [[Henry Brougham, 1st Baron Brougham and Vaux|Henry Brougham]] persuaded him to study the [[diffraction]] of light. The results of his investigations were communicated from time to time in papers to the ''[[Philosophical Transactions]]'' of London and other scientific journals. The fact that other scientists – notably [[Étienne-Louis Malus]] and [[Augustin Fresnel]] – were pursuing the same investigations contemporaneously in France does not invalidate Brewster's claim to independent discovery, even though in one or two cases the priority must be assigned to others.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} A lesser-known classmate of his, [[Thomas Dick (scientist)|Thomas Dick]], also went on to become a popular astronomical writer.

The most important subjects of his inquiries can be enumerated under the following five headings:
#The laws of [[light polarization]] by [[Reflection (physics)|reflection]] and [[refraction]], and other quantitative laws of phenomena;
#The discovery of the polarising structure induced by heat and [[pressure]];
#The discovery of crystals with two axes of double refraction, and many of the laws of their phenomena, including the connection between optical structure and crystalline forms;
#The laws of metallic reflection;
#Experiments on the absorption of light.

In this line of investigation, the prime importance belongs to the discovery of
#the connection between the refractive index and the polarizing angle;
#biaxial crystals, and
#the production of double refraction by irregular heating.

These discoveries were promptly recognised. As early as 1807 the degree of [[Legum Doctor|LL.D.]] was conferred upon Brewster by [[Marischal College]], [[Aberdeen, Scotland|Aberdeen]]; in 1815 he was elected a Fellow of the [[Royal Society|Royal Society of London]], and received the [[Copley Medal]]; in 1818 he received the [[Rumford Medal]] of the society; and in 1816 the [[French Institute]] awarded him one-half of the prize of three thousand francs for the two most important discoveries in physical science made in Europe during the two preceding years.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} In 1821, he was made a foreign member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]], and in 1822 a Foreign Honorary Member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]].&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter B|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterB.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=9 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Brewster cigar box.jpg|thumb|Inner picture of a cigar box from the early 1900s with a portrait of Brewster.]]
Among the non-scientific public, his fame spread more effectually by his invention in about 1815 of the [[kaleidoscope]], for which there was a great demand in both the United Kingdom, France, and the United States.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} As a reflection of this fame, Brewster portrait was later printed in some cigar boxes. Brewster chose renowned [[achromatic lens]] developer [[Carpenter and Westley|Philip Carpenter]] as the sole manufacturer of the kaleidoscope in 1817. Although Brewster patented the kaleidoscope in 1817 (GB 4136),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ssplprints.com/image/100297/brewsters-patent-kaleidoscope-c-1817 Brewster's patent kaleidoscope, c 1817.] ssplprints.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brewstersociety.com/brewster_patent.pdf PDF copy of the Brewster Patent GB 4136] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721020838/http://www.brewstersociety.com/brewster_patent.pdf |date=21 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a copy of the prototype was shown to London opticians and copied before the patent was granted. As a consequence, the kaleidoscope became produced in large numbers, but yielded no direct financial benefits to Brewster.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Myles W.

[[File:PSM V21 D055 The brewster stereoscope 1849.jpg|thumb|The Brewster stereoscope, 1849.]]
An instrument of more significance, the [[stereoscope]], which – though of much later date (1849) – along with the kaleidoscope did more than anything else to popularise his name, was not as has often been asserted the invention of Brewster. Sir [[Charles Wheatstone]] discovered its principle and applied it as early as 1838 to the construction of a cumbersome but effective instrument, in which the binocular pictures were made to combine by means of [[mirror]]s.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} A dogged rival of Wheatstone's, Brewster was unwilling to credit him with the invention, however, and proposed that the true author of the stereoscope was a Mr. Elliot, a "Teacher of Mathematics" from Edinburgh, who, according to Brewster, had conceived of the principles as early as 1823 and had constructed a lensless and mirrorless prototype in 1839, through which one could view drawn landscape transparencies, since photography had yet to be invented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zone|first=Ray|title=Stereoscopic Cinema and the Origins of 3-D Film, 1838–1952|year=2007|publisher=University Press of Kentucky|location=Lexington|isbn=978-0813124612|pages=9–10|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C1dgJ3-y1ZsC&amp;pg=PA9&amp;lpg=PA9&amp;dq=mr.+elliot+stereoscope+brewster&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=iUW2QPC31i&amp;sig=HQ_GHth1MtwC6vnS2oCc2PVA0Fs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=zYs3Upi2Kqnh2AXrzoCwCw&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=mr.%20elliot%20stereoscope%20brewster&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brewster's personal contribution was the suggestion to use [[Prism (optics)|prisms]] for uniting the dissimilar pictures; and accordingly the lenticular stereoscope may fairly be said to be his invention.

A much more valuable and practical result of Brewster's optical researches was the improvement of the British [[lighthouse]] system. Although Fresnel, who had also the satisfaction of being the first to put it into operation, perfected the dioptric apparatus independently, Brewster was active earlier in the field than Fresnel, describing the dioptric apparatus in 1812. Brewster pressed its adoption on those in authority at least as early as 1820, two years before Fresnel suggested it, and it was finally introduced into lighthouses mainly through Brewster's persistent efforts.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

===Other work===
Although Brewster's own discoveries were important, they were not his only service to science. He began writing in 1799 as a regular contributor to the ''[[Ruddiman's Edinburgh Magazine|Edinburgh Magazine]]'', of which he acted as editor at the age of twenty. In 1807, he undertook the editorship of the newly projected ''[[Edinburgh Encyclopædia]]'', of which the first part appeared in 1808, and the last not until 1830. The work was strongest in the scientific department, and many of its most valuable articles were from the pen of the editor. At a later period he was one of the leading contributors to the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' (seventh and eighth editions) writing, among others, the articles on electricity, [[hydrodynamics]], [[magnetism]], [[microscope]], [[optics]], [[stereoscope]], and [[voltaic electricity]].  He was elected a member of the [[American Antiquarian Society]] in 1816.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanantiquarian.org/memberlistb American Antiquarian Society Members Directory]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1819 Brewster undertook further editorial work by establishing, in conjunction with [[Robert Jameson]] (1774–1854), the ''[[Edinburgh Philosophical Journal]]'', which took the place of the ''Edinburgh Magazine''. The first ten volumes (1819–1824) were published under the joint editorship of Brewster and Jameson, the remaining four volumes (1825–1826) being edited by Jameson alone. After parting company with Jameson, Brewster started the ''[[Edinburgh Journal of Science]]'' in 1824, 16 volumes of which appeared under his editorship during the years 1824–1832, with very many articles from his own pen.

He contributed around three hundred papers&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt; to the transactions of various learned societies, and few of his contemporaries wrote as much for the various reviews. In the ''[[North British Review]]'' alone, seventy-five articles of his appeared. A list of his larger separate works will be found below. Special mention, however, must be made of the most important of them all: his biography of Sir [[Isaac Newton]]. In 1831 he published the ''Life of Sir Isaac Newton'',&lt;ref&gt;Sir David Brewster, ''Memoirs of the Life, Writings, and Discoveries of Sir Isaac Newton'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=B5IfAQAAMAAJ Vol. 1], Preface&lt;/ref&gt; a short popular account of the philosopher's life, in ''[[Murray's Family Library]]'', followed by an 1832 American edition in Harper's Family Library;&lt;ref&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=gLcVAAAAYAAJ The Life of Sir Isaac Newton]'' (1832) Harper's Family Library, New York, No. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; but it was not until 1855 that he was able to issue the much fuller ''Memoirs of the Life, Writings and Discoveries of Sir Isaac Newton'', a work which embodied the results of more than 20 years' investigation of original manuscripts and other available sources.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1 |wstitle=Brewster, Sir David|volume=4 |pages=513-514}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Discovery of gravitation, A.D. 1666" by Sir David Brewster, in ''The Great Events by Famous Historians'', Rossiter Johnson, LL.D. Editor-in-Chief, Volume XII, pp. 51–65, ''The National Alumni'', 1905.&lt;/ref&gt;

Brewster's position as editor brought him into frequent contact with the most eminent scientific men, and he was naturally among the first to recognise the benefit that would accrue from regular communication among those in the field of science. In a review of [[Charles Babbage]]'s book ''Decline of Science in England'' in ''[[Quarterly Review|John Murray's Quarterly Review]]'', he suggested the creation of "an association of our nobility, clergy, gentry and philosophers".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=nlUAAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA341 Reflexions on the Decline of Science in England, and on some of its Causes], ''Quarterly Review'', Vol. 43, Nr. 86 (October 1830)&lt;/ref&gt; This was taken up by various ''Declinarians'' and found speedy realisation in the [[British Association for the Advancement of Science]]. Its first meeting was held at [[York]] in 1831; and Brewster, along with Babbage and Sir [[John Herschel]], had the chief part in shaping its constitution.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

In the same year in which the British Association held its first meeting, Brewster received the honour of knighthood and the decoration of the [[Royal Guelphic Order]]. In 1838, he was appointed principal of the united colleges of St Salvator and St Leonard, [[University of St Andrews]]. In 1849, he acted as president of the British Association and was elected one of the eight foreign associates of the [[Institute of France]] in succession to [[Jöns Jakob Berzelius|J. J. Berzelius]]; and ten years later, he accepted the office of principal of the University of Edinburgh, the duties of which he discharged until within a few months of his death.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; In 1855, the government of France made him an [[Officier de la Légion d'honneur]].

He was a close friend of [[William Henry Fox Talbot]], inventor of the [[calotype]] process, who sent Brewster early examples of his work. It was Brewster who suggested Talbot only patent his process in England, initiating the development of early photography in Scotland and eventually allowing for the formation of the first photographic society in the world, the [[Edinburgh Calotype Club]], in 1843.&lt;ref name=odnb /&gt; Brewster was a prominent member of the club until its dissolution sometime in the mid-1850s; however, his interest in photography continued, and he was elected the first President of the [[Photographic Society of Scotland]] when it was founded in 1856.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The British Journal of Photography|volume=XXI|publisher=Henry Greenwood|location=London|page=385|url=https://archive.org/stream/britishjournalp01socigoog#page/n395/mode/2up|editor=J. T. Taylor|display-editors=etal|accessdate=2 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of a high-strung and nervous temperament, Brewster was somewhat irritable in matters of controversy; but he was repeatedly subjected to serious provocation. He was a man of highly honourable and fervently religious character. In estimating his place among scientific discoverers, the chief thing to be borne in mind is that his genius was not characteristically mathematical. His method was empirical, and the laws that he established were generally the result of repeated experiment. To the ultimate explanation of the phenomena with which he dealt he contributed nothing, and it is noteworthy although he did not maintain to the end of his life the corpuscular theory he never explicitly adopted the wave theory of light. Few would dispute the verdict of [[James David Forbes]], an editor of the eighth edition of the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'': "His scientific glory is different in kind from that of [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Young]] and Fresnel; but the discoverer of the law of polarization of biaxial crystals, of optical mineralogy, and of double refraction by compression, will always occupy a foremost rank in the intellectual history of the age." In addition to the various works of Brewster already mentioned, the following may be added: ''Notes and Introduction to Carlyle's translation of Legendre's Elements of Geometry'' (1824); ''Treatise on Optics'' (1831); [http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.rbc/general.29167.1 '' Letters on Natural Magic'', addressed to Sir Walter Scott (1832)] ''The Martyrs of Science, or the Lives of Galileo, Tycho Brahe, and Kepler'' (1841); ''More Worlds than One'' (1854).&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

In his ''Treatise'' he demonstrated that vegetal colors were related with the [[absorption spectra]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Charles Robert Cross (1848–1921, ed)|author2=William Ripley Nichols|author3=John Trowbridge (1843–1923, ed) |author4=Samuel Kneeland |author5=George Bliss |author6=David Ames Wells|title=Year-book of Facts in Science and Art|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=07cWAQAAIAAJ|year=1854|quote=Sir David Brewster had several years before discovered a remarkable phenomenon in an alcoholic solution of the green coloring matter of leaves, or, as it is called by chemists, chlorophyll}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he described for the first time the red fluorescence of [[chlorophyll]].

===History of Scottish Freemasonry===
As well as his many scientific works and biographies of notable scientists, Brewster also wrote 'The History of Free Masonry, Drawn from Authentic Sources of Information; with an Account of the Grand Lodge of Scotland, from Its Institution in 1736, to the Present Time',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/009710912 |title=The history of freemasonry, drawn from authentic sources of information; with an account of the Grand lodge of Scotland, from its institution in 1736, to the present time, compiled from the records; and an appendix of original papers. |last=Brewster |first=David |year=1804 |location=Edinburgh |publisher=A. Lawrie and Co.}}&lt;/ref&gt; published in 1804, when he was only 23. The work was commissioned by Alexander Lawrie, publisher to the [[Grand Lodge of Scotland]], to whom the work has been, frequently, mis-attributed. The book has become one of the standard works on early Scottish freemasonry, although there is no evidence that Brewster was a freemason at the time he wrote the book, nor any that he became one later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cooper |first=Robert |year=2006 |title=Cracking The Freemason's Code |publisher=[[Penguin (publisher)|Penguin]] |page=157 |isbn=9781846040498}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Opposition to evolution ===
Brewster's Christian beliefs stirred him to respond against the idea of the transmutation of species and the theory of evolution. His opinion was that "science and religion must be one since each dealt with Truth, which had only one and the same Author."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Strathan |first1=Alexander |title=The Day of Rest in The Library Magazine of American and Foreign Thought |date=1881 |publisher=American Book Exchange |location=New York |page=426 |edition=Vol 8 |url=https://archive.org/stream/librarymagazine13unkngoog#page/n426/search/Darwin |accessdate=18 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1845 he wrote a highly critical review of the evolutionist work ''[[Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation]]'', in the ''[[North British Review]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John M. Lynch|title="Vestiges" and the Debate Before Darwin|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Gr6ZiGHAqHcC&amp;pg=PA471|publisher=A&amp;C Black|isbn=978-1-85506-862-9|pages=471|volume=1}}. First published in ''[[North British Review]]''. vol 3 (August 1845, pp. 470–515)&lt;/ref&gt; which he considered to be an insult to Christian revelation and a dangerous example of materialism.

In 1862, he responded to Darwin's ''On the Origin of Species'' and published the article ''[[s:The Facts and Fancies of Mr. Darwin|The Facts and Fancies of Mr Darwin]]'' in ''Good Words''. He stated that Darwin's book combined both "interesting facts and idle fancies" which made up a "dangerous and degrading speculation". He accepted adaptive changes, but he strongly opposed Darwin's statement about the ''primordial form'', which he considered an offensive idea to "both the naturalist and the Christian."&lt;ref&gt;Good Words (1862), Vol. 3; by Norman Macleod D. D. J.; Donald Macleod &amp; Hartley Aspden. Alexander Strahan and Company. pp. 3–8&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==

Brewster married twice. His first wife, Juliet Macpherson (c. 1776–1850), was a daughter of James Macpherson (1736–1796), a probable translator of [[Ossian]] poems. They married on 31 July 1810 in Edinburgh and had four sons and a daughter:&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''De motu corporum in gyrum''''' ("On the motion of bodies in an orbit") is the presumed title of a manuscript by [[Isaac Newton]] sent to [[Edmond Halley]] in November 1684. It followed a visit by Halley earlier in that year, when Halley had questioned Newton about problems then exercising the minds of Halley and his scientific circle in London, including Sir [[Christopher Wren]] and [[Robert Hooke]].

The title of the document is only presumed because the original is now lost. Its contents are inferred from surviving documents, which are two contemporary copies and a draft. Only the draft has the title now used; both copies are without title.&lt;ref&gt;D T Whiteside (ed.), Mathematical Papers of Isaac newton, vol.6 (1684–1691), (Cambridge University Press, 1974), [https://books.google.com/books?id=lIZ0v23iqRgC&amp;pg=PA30 at pages 30]-91.&lt;/ref&gt;

This manuscript (''De Motu'' for short, but not to be confused with several other Newtonian papers carrying titles that start with these words) gave important mathematical derivations relating to the three relations now known as [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion|"Kepler's laws"]] (before Newton's work, these had not been generally regarded as laws).&lt;ref&gt;Curtis Wilson: "From Kepler's Laws, so-called, to Universal Gravitation: Empirical Factors", in ''Archives for History of the Exact Sciences'', 6 (1970), pp.89–170.&lt;/ref&gt;  Halley reported the communication from Newton to the [[Royal Society]] on 10 December 1684 ([[Old Style]]). After further encouragement from Halley, Newton went on to develop and write his book ''[[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]'' (commonly known as the ''Principia'') from a nucleus that can be seen in ''De Motu'' – of which nearly all of the content also reappears in the ''Principia''.

==Contents==

One of the surviving copies of ''De Motu'' was made by being entered in the [[Royal Society]]'s register book, and its (Latin) text is available online.&lt;ref&gt;The surviving copy in the Royal Society's register book was printed in S P Rigaud's 'Historical Essay' of 1838 (in the original Latin), but note that the title was added by Rigaud, and the original copy had no title: online, it is [https://books.google.com/books?id=uvMGAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA111 available here as ''Isaaci Newtoni Propositiones De Motu''].&lt;/ref&gt;

For ease of cross-reference to the contents of ''De Motu'' that appeared again in the ''Principia'', there are online sources for the ''Principia'' in English translation,&lt;ref&gt;English translations are based on the third (1726) edition, and the first English translation, of 1729, as far as Book 1, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Tm0FAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA65 is available here].&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in Latin.&lt;ref&gt;Newton's ''Principia'' in its original 1687 edition is online in text-searchable form (in the original Latin) [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/28233 here].&lt;/ref&gt;

''De motu corporum in gyrum'' is short enough to set out here the contents of its different sections. It contains 11 propositions, labelled as 'theorems' and 'problems', some with corollaries. Before reaching this core subject-matter, Newton begins with some preliminaries:

*'''3 Definitions''':
:1: 'Centripetal force' (Newton originated this term, and its first occurrence is in this document) impels or attracts a body to some point regarded as a center.  (This reappears in Definition 5 of the ''Principia''.)
:2: 'Inherent force' of a body is defined in a way that prepares for the idea of inertia and of Newton's first law; (in the absence of external force, a body continues in its state of motion either at rest or in uniform motion along a straight line).  (Definition 3 of the ''Principia'' is to similar effect.)
:3: 'Resistance': the property of a medium that regularly impedes motion.

*'''4 Hypotheses''':
:1: Newton indicates that in the first 9 propositions below, resistance is assumed nil, then for the remaining (2) propositions, resistance is assumed proportional both to the speed of the body and to the density of the medium.
:2: By its intrinsic force (alone) every body would progress uniformly in a straight line to infinity unless something external hinders that.
(Newton's later first law of motion is to similar effect, Law 1 in the ''Principia''.)
:3: Forces combine by a parallelogram rule. Newton treats them in effect as we now treat vectors. This point reappears in Corollaries 1 and 2 to the third law of motion, Law 3 in the ''Principia''.
:4: In the initial moments of effect of a centripetal force, the distance is proportional to the square of the time. (The context indicates that Newton was dealing here with infinitesimals or their limiting ratios.) This reappears in Book 1, Lemma 10 in the ''Principia''.

Then follow two more preliminary points:

*'''2 Lemmas''':
:1: Newton briefly sets out continued products of proportions involving differences:
:if A/(A-B) = B/(B-C) = C/(C-D) etc, then A/B = B/C = C/D etc.
:2: All parallelograms touching a given ellipse (to be understood: at the end-points of [[conjugate diameters]]) are equal in area.

Then follows Newton's main subject-matter, labelled as theorems, problems, corollaries and scholia:

===Theorem 1===
'''Theorem 1''' demonstrates that where an orbiting body is subject only to a centripetal force, it follows that a radius vector, drawn from the body to the attracting center, sweeps out equal areas in equal times (no matter how the centripetal force varies with distance). (Newton uses for this derivation – as he does in later proofs in this ''De Motu'', as well as in many parts of the later ''Principia'' – a limit argument of infinitesimal calculus in geometric form,&lt;ref&gt;The content of infinitesimal calculus in the ''Principia'' was recognized, both in Newton's lifetime and later, among others by the [[Guillaume de l'Hôpital|Marquis de l'Hospital]], whose 1696 book "Analyse des infiniment petits" (Infinitesimal analysis) stated in its preface, about the ''Principia'', that 'nearly all of it is of this calculus' ('lequel est presque tout de ce calcul'). See also D T Whiteside (1970), "The mathematical principles underlying Newton's ''Principia Mathematica''", ''Journal for the History of Astronomy'', vol.1 (1970), 116–138, especially at p.120.&lt;/ref&gt; in which the area swept out by the radius vector is divided into triangle-sectors. They are of small and decreasing size considered to tend towards zero individually, while their number increases without limit.) This theorem appears again, with expanded explanation, as Proposition 1, Theorem 1, of the ''Principia''.

===Theorem 2===
'''Theorem 2''' considers a body moving uniformly in a circular orbit, and shows that for any given time-segment, the centripetal force (directed towards the center of the circle, treated here as a center of attraction) is proportional to the square of the arc-length traversed, and inversely proportional to the radius. (This subject reappears as Proposition 4, Theorem 4 in the ''Principia'', and the corollaries here reappear also.)

'''Corollary 1''' then points out that the centripetal force is proportional to V&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/R, where V is the orbital speed and R the circular radius.

'''Corollary 2''' shows that, putting this in another way, the centripetal force is proportional to (1/P&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) * R where P is the orbital period.

'''Corollary 3''' shows that if P&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is proportional to R, then the centripetal force would be independent of R.

'''Corollary 4''' shows that if P&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is proportional to R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, then the centripetal force would be proportional to 1/R.

'''Corollary 5''' shows that if P&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is proportional to R&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, then the centripetal force would be proportional to 1/(R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;).

A '''scholium''' then points out that the Corollary 5 relation (square of orbital period proportional to cube of orbital size) is observed to apply to the planets in their orbits around the Sun, and to the Galilean satellites orbiting Jupiter.

===Theorem 3===
'''Theorem 3''' now evaluates the centripetal force in a non-circular orbit, using another geometrical limit argument, involving ratios of vanishingly small line-segments. The demonstration comes down to evaluating the curvature of the orbit as if it were made of infinitesimal arcs, and the centripetal force at any point is evaluated from the speed and the curvature of the local infinitesimal arc. This subject reappears in the ''Principia'' as Proposition 6 of Book 1.

A '''corollary''' then points out how it is possible in this way to determine the centripetal force for any given shape of orbit and center.

'''Problem '''1 then explores the case of a circular orbit, assuming the center of attraction is on the circumference of the circle. A scholium points out that if the orbiting body were to reach such a center, it would then depart along the tangent. (Proposition 7 in the ''Principia''.)

'''Problem 2''' explores the case of an ellipse, where the center of attraction is at its center, and finds that the centripetal force to produce motion in that configuration would be directly proportional to the radius vector. (This material becomes Proposition 10, Problem 5 in the ''Principia''.)

'''Problem 3''' again explores the ellipse, but now treats the further case where the center of attraction is at one of its foci.  "A body orbits in an [[ellipse]]: there is required the law of centripetal force tending to a focus of the ellipse." Here Newton finds the centripetal force to produce motion in this configuration would be inversely proportional to the square of the radius vector. (Translation: 'Therefore the centripetal force is reciprocally as L X SP², that is, (reciprocally) in the doubled ratio [i.e. square] of the distance ... .') This becomes Proposition 11 in the ''Principia''.

A '''scholium''' then points out that this Problem 3 proves that the planetary orbits are ellipses with the Sun at one focus. (Translation:  'The major planets orbit, therefore, in ellipses having a focus at the centre of the Sun, and with their ''radii'' (''vectores'') drawn to the Sun describe areas proportional to the times, altogether (Latin: 'omnino') as [[Johannes Kepler|Kepler]] supposed.') (This conclusion is reached after taking as initial fact the observed proportionality between square of orbital period and cube of orbital size, considered in corollary 5 to Theorem 1.) (A controversy over the cogency of the conclusion is described below.) The subject of Problem 3 becomes Proposition 11, Problem 6, in the ''Principia''.

===Theorem 4===
'''Theorem 4''' shows that with a centripetal force inversely proportional to the square of the radius vector, the time of revolution of a body in an elliptical orbit with a given major axis is the same as it would be for the body in a circular orbit with the same diameter as that major axis. (Proposition 15 in the ''Principia''.)

A '''scholium''' points out how this enables determining the planetary ellipses and the locations of their foci by indirect measurements.

'''Problem 4''' then explores, for the case of an inverse-square law of centripetal force, how to determine the orbital ellipse for a given starting position, speed, and direction of the orbiting body. Newton points out here, that if the speed is high enough, the orbit is no longer an ellipse, but is instead a parabola or hyperbola. He also identifies a geometrical criterion for distinguishing between the elliptical case and the others, based on the calculated size of the [[latus rectum]], as a proportion to the distance the orbiting body at closest approach to the center. (Proposition 17 in the ''Principia''.)

A '''scholium''' then remarks that a bonus of this demonstration is that it allows definition of the orbits of comets, and enables an estimation of their periods and returns where the orbits are elliptical. Some practical difficulties of implementing this are also discussed.

Finally in the series of propositions based on zero resistance from any medium, '''Problem 5''' discusses the case of a degenerate elliptical orbit, amounting to a straight-line fall towards or ejection from the attracting center. (Proposition 32 in the ''Principia''.)

A '''scholium''' points out how problems 4 and 5 would apply to projectiles in the atmosphere and to the fall of heavy bodies, if the atmospheric resistance could be assumed nil.

Lastly, Newton attempts to extend the results to the case where there is atmospheric resistance, considering first ('''Problem 6''') the effects of resistance on inertial motion in a straight line, and then ('''Problem 7''') the combined effects of resistance and a uniform centripetal force on motion towards/away from the center in a homogeneous medium. Both problems are addressed geometrically using hyperbolic constructions. These last two 'Problems' reappear in Book 2 of the ''Principia'' as Propositions 2 and 3.

Then a final '''scholium''' points out how problems 6 and 7 apply to the horizontal and vertical components of the motion of projectiles in the atmosphere (in this case neglecting earth curvature).

==Commentaries on the contents==
At some points in 'De Motu', Newton depends on matters proved being used in practice as a basis for regarding their converses as also proved. This has been seen as especially so in regard to 'Problem 3'. Newton's style of demonstration in all his writings was rather brief in places; he appeared to assume that certain steps would be found self-evident or obvious. In 'De Motu', as in the first edition of the ''Principia'', Newton did not specifically state a basis for extending the proofs to the converse. The proof of the converse here depends on its being apparent that there is a uniqueness relation, i.e. that in any given setup, only one orbit corresponds to one given and specified set of force/velocity/starting position. Newton added a mention of this kind into the second edition of the ''Principia'', as a Corollary to Propositions 11–13, in response to criticism of this sort made during his lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;See D T Whiteside (ed.), ''Mathematical Papers of Isaac Newton'', vol. 6 (1684–1691), [https://books.google.com/books?id=lIZ0v23iqRgC&amp;pg=PA56 at pages 56]-57, footnote 73.&lt;/ref&gt;

A significant scholarly controversy has existed over the question whether and how far these extensions to the converse, and the associated uniqueness statements, are self-evident and obvious or not. (There is no suggestion that the converses are not true, or that they were not stated by Newton, the argument has been over whether Newton's proofs were satisfactory or not.)&lt;ref&gt;The criticism is recounted by C Wilson in "Newton's Orbit Problem, A Historian's Response", ''College Mathematics Journal'' (1994) 25(3), pp.193–200, at pp.195–6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For further discussion of the point see Curtis Wilson, in "Newton's Orbit Problem, A Historian's Response", ''College Mathematics Journal'' (1994) 25(3), pp.193–200, at p.196, concurring that Newton had given the outline of an argument; also D T Whiteside, Math. Papers vol.6, p.57; and Bruce Pourciau, "On Newton's proof that inverse-square orbits must be conics", ''Annals of Science 48'' (1991) 159–172; but the point was disagreed by R. Weinstock, who called it a 'petitio principii', see e.g. "Newton's ''Principia'' and inverse-square orbits: the flaw reexamined", ''Historia Math''. 19(1) (1992), pp.60–70.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The argument is also spelled out by Bruce Pourciau in "From centripetal forces to conic orbits: a path through the early sections of Newton's Principia", ''Studies in the History and Philosophy of Science'', 38 (2007), pp.56–83.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Halley's question==

The details of [[Edmund Halley]]'s visit to Newton in 1684 are known to us only from reminiscences of thirty to forty years later. According to one of these reminiscences, Halley asked Newton, "...what he thought the Curve would be that would be described by the Planets supposing the force of attraction towards the Sun to be reciprocal to the square of their distance from it."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Richard S. Westfall's ''Never at Rest'', Chapter 10, Page 403; giving the version of the question in John Conduitt's report.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another version of the question was given by Newton himself, but also about thirty years after the event: he wrote that Halley, asking him "if I knew what figure the Planets described in their Orbs about the Sun was very desirous to have my Demonstration"&lt;ref&gt;Newton's note is now in the Cambridge University Library at MS Add.3968, f.101; and printed by I Bernard Cohen, in "Introduction to Newton's ''Principia''", 1971, at p.293.&lt;/ref&gt; In light of these differing reports, both produced from old memories, it is hard to know exactly what words Halley used.

It has been sometimes suggested{{by whom|date=December 2012}} that Newton answered a question different from the one Halley had asked, but any certainty is clearly hard to obtain on this point.

==Role of Robert Hooke==

Newton acknowledged in 1686 that an initial stimulus on him in 1679/80 to extend his investigations of the movements of heavenly bodies had arisen from correspondence with [[Robert Hooke]] in 1679/80.&lt;ref name=1679letters&gt;H W Turnbull (ed.), ''Correspondence of Isaac Newton, Vol 2'' (1676–1687), (Cambridge University Press, 1960), giving the Hooke-Newton correspondence (of November 1679 to January 1679|80) at pp.297–314, and the 1686 correspondence at pp.431–448.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hooke had started an exchange of correspondence in November 1679 by writing to Newton, to tell Newton that Hooke had been appointed to manage the Royal Society's correspondence.&lt;ref&gt;''Correspondence'' vol.2 already cited, at p.297.&lt;/ref&gt; Hooke therefore wanted to hear from members about their researches, or their views about the researches of others; and as if to whet Newton's interest, he asked what Newton thought about various matters, and then gave a whole list, mentioning "compounding the celestial motions of the planetts of a direct motion by the tangent and an attractive motion towards the central body", and "my hypothesis of the lawes or causes of springinesse", and then a new hypothesis from Paris about planetary motions (which Hooke described at length), and then efforts to carry out or improve national surveys, the difference of latitude between London and Cambridge, and other items. Newton replied with "a fansy of my own" about determining the Earth's motion, using a falling body. Hooke disagreed with Newton's idea of how the falling body would move, and a short correspondence developed.

Later, in 1686, when Newton's ''Principia'' had been presented to the Royal Society, Hooke claimed from this correspondence the credit for some of Newton's content in the ''Principia'', and said Newton owed the idea of an inverse-square law of attraction to him – although at the same time, Hooke disclaimed any credit for the curves and trajectories that Newton had demonstrated on the basis of the inverse square law.&lt;ref name=1686letters&gt;H W Turnbull (ed.), ''Correspondence of Isaac Newton, Vol 2'' (1676–1687), (Cambridge University Press, 1960), giving the Halley-Newton correspondence of May to July 1686 about Hooke's claims at pp.431–448.&lt;/ref&gt;

Newton, who heard of this from Halley, rebutted Hooke's claim in letters to Halley, acknowledging only an occasion of reawakened interest.&lt;ref name=1686letters /&gt; Newton did acknowledge some prior work of others, including [[Ismaël Bullialdus]], who suggested (but without demonstration) that there was an attractive force from the Sun in the inverse square proportion to the distance, and [[Giovanni Alfonso Borelli]], who suggested (again without demonstration) that there was a tendency towards the Sun like gravity or magnetism that would make the planets move in ellipses; but that the elements Hooke claimed were due either to Newton himself, or to other predecessors of them both such as Bullialdus and Borelli, but not Hooke. Wren and Halley were both sceptical of Hooke's claims, recalling an occasion when Hooke had claimed to have a derivation of planetary motions under an inverse square law, but had failed to produce it even under the incentive of a prize.&lt;ref name=1686letters /&gt;

There has been scholarly controversy over exactly what if anything Newton really gained from Hooke, apart from the stimulus that Newton acknowledged.&lt;ref&gt;Aspects of the controversy can be seen for example in the following papers: N Guicciardini, "Reconsidering the Hooke-Newton debate on Gravitation: Recent Results", in ''Early Science and Medicine'', 10 (2005), 511–517; Ofer Gal, "The Invention of Celestial Mechanics", in ''Early Science and Medicine'', 10 (2005), 529–534; M Nauenberg, "Hooke's and Newton's Contributions to the Early Development of Orbital mechanics and Universal Gravitation", in ''Early Science and Medicine'', 10 (2005), 518–528.&lt;/ref&gt;

About thirty years after Newton's death in 1727, [[Alexis Clairaut]], one of Newton's early and eminent successors in the field of gravitational studies, wrote after reviewing Hooke's work that it showed "what a distance there is between a truth that is glimpsed and a truth that is demonstrated".&lt;ref&gt;W.W. Rouse Ball, ''An Essay on Newton's 'Principia''' (London and New York: Macmillan, 1893), at page 69.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''diffuson''' is a [[mathematic]]al object, which often appears in the theory of disordered electronic systems (a part of [[condensed matter physics]]). 

In a disordered system, the motion of an electron is not ballistic, but diffusive: i.e., the [[electron]] does not move along a straight line, but experiences a series of random scatterings off of impurities. This random motion ([[diffusion]]) is described by a differential equation, known as the [[diffusion equation]]. The diffuson is the [[Green's function]] of the diffusion equation.

The diffuson plays an important role in the theory of electron transport in disordered systems, especially for phase coherent effects such as [[universal conductance fluctuations]].

==Biography==
Son of the astronomer [[Nathaniel Pigott]], Pigott's work focused on [[variable stars]]. Educated in France with a mother from [[Louvain, Belgium|Louvain]], the family moved to [[York]] in 1781. Despite their significant age difference, he was a friend and collaborator of [[John Goodricke]] (his distant cousin&lt;ref name="odnb_npigott"/&gt;) until the latter's untimely death at the age of 21 in 1786.&lt;ref name="hoskin1979"&gt;{{cite journal

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5412">[[Image:Energese.jpg|thumb|140px|right| The Energy Systems Language of Systems Ecology]]

The '''Energy Systems Language''', also referred to as '''Energese''', '''Energy Circuit Language''', or '''Generic Systems Symbols''', was developed by the [[ecologist]] [[Howard T. Odum]] and colleagues in the 1950s during studies of the tropical forests funded by the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission]]. They are used to compose energy flow diagrams in the field of [[systems ecology]].

==Design intent==
The design intent of the energy systems language was to facilitate the generic depiction of energy flows through any scale system while encompassing the [[laws of physics]], and in particular, the laws of [[thermodynamics]] (see [[energy transformation]] for an example).

In particular H.T. Odum aimed to produce a language which could facilitate the intellectual analysis, engineering synthesis and management of global systems such as the geobiosphere, and its many subsystems. Within this aim, H.T. Odum had a strong concern that many abstract mathematical models of such systems were not thermodynamically valid. Hence he used analog computers to make system models due to their [[Intrinsic value (ethics)|intrinsic value]]; that is, the electronic circuits are of value for modelling natural systems which are assumed to obey the laws of energy flow, because, in themselves the circuits, like natural systems, also obey the known laws of energy flow, where the [[energy forms|energy form]] is electrical. However Odum was interested not only in the electronic circuits themselves, but also in how they might be used as formal analogies for modeling other systems which also had energy flowing through them. As a result, Odum did not restrict his inquiry to the analysis and synthesis of any one system in isolation. The discipline that is most often associated with this kind of approach, together with the use of the energy systems language is known as [[systems ecology]].

==General characteristics==
[[Image:PassiveAnalog.jpg|thumb|220px|left| Passive electrical equivalent of Energy Systems Language storage icon]]
When applying the electronic circuits (and schematics) to modeling ecological and economic systems, Odum believed that generic categories, or characteristic modules, could be derived. Moreover he felt that a general symbolic system, fully defined in electronic terms (including the mathematics thereof) would be useful for depicting real system characteristics, such as the general categories of production, storage, flow, transformation, and consumption. Central principles of electronics also therefore became central features of the energy systems language – Odum's generic symbolism.

Depicted to the left is what the generic symbol for storage, which Odum named the Bertalanffy module, in honor of the [[General systems theory|general systems]] theorist [[Ludwig von Bertalanffy]].

For Odum, in order to achieve a [[holistic]] understanding of how many apparently different systems actually affect each other, it was important to have a generic language with a massively scalable modeling capacity – to model global-to-local, ecological, physical and economic systems. The intention was, and for those who still apply it, is, to make biological, physical, ecological, economic and other system models thermodynamically, and so also [[energetics|energetically]], valid and [[Verification and validation|verifiable]]. As a consequence the designers of the language also aimed to include the energy metabolism of any system within the scope of inquiry.

==Pictographic icons==
In order to aid learning, in ''Modeling for all Scales'' Odum and Odum (2000) suggested systems might first be introduced with pictographic icons, and then later defined in the generic symbolism.  [[Pictograms]] have therefore been used in software programs like ExtendSim to depict the basic categories of the  Energy Systems Language. Some have argued that such an approach shares similar motivations to [[Otto Neurath]]'s [[Isotype (pictograms)|isotype]] project, [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]]'s ([[Characteristica Universalis]]) [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] Project and [[Buckminster Fuller]]'s works.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="29893">The term '''ephemeris time''' (often abbreviated '''ET''') can in principle refer to time in connection with any [[Ephemeris|astronomical ephemeris]]. In practice it has been used more specifically to refer to:

# a former standard astronomical time scale adopted in 1952 by the [[International Astronomical Union|IAU]],&lt;ref name=ESAE&gt;[[#refESAE|'ESAE 1961': 'Explanatory Supplement (1961)]], esp. p.9.&lt;/ref&gt; and superseded in the 1970s.&lt;ref name=ESAA&gt;[[#refESAA|'ESAA (1992)': P K Seidelmann (ed).]], especially  [https://books.google.com/books?id=uJ4JhGJANb4C&amp;pg=PA41 at pp.41-42] and [https://books.google.com/books?id=uJ4JhGJANb4C&amp;pg=PA79 at p.79].&lt;/ref&gt;  This time scale was proposed in 1948, to overcome the drawbacks of irregularly fluctuating [[mean solar time]].  The intent was to define a uniform time (as far as was then feasible) based on Newtonian theory (see below: [[#Definition of ephemeris time (1952)|Definition of ephemeris time (1952)]]).  Ephemeris time was a first application of the concept of a [[dynamical time scale]], in which the time and time scale are defined implicitly, inferred from the observed position of an astronomical object via the dynamical theory of its motion.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refGuin1988|B Guinot and P K Seidelmann (1988)]], at p.304-5.&lt;/ref&gt;
# a modern relativistic coordinate time scale, implemented by the [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory|JPL]] ephemeris time argument T&lt;sub&gt;eph&lt;/sub&gt;, in a series of numerically integrated [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory Development Ephemeris|Development Ephemerides]]. Among them is the [[DE405]] ephemeris in widespread current use.  The time scale represented by T&lt;sub&gt;eph&lt;/sub&gt; is closely related to, but distinct (by an offset and constant rate) from, the [[Barycentric Coordinate Time|TCB]] time scale currently adopted as a standard by the [[IAU]] (see below: [[#JPL ephemeris time argument Teph|JPL ephemeris time argument Teph]]).&lt;ref name=EMS1998&gt;[[#refEMS1998|E M Standish (1998)]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the following sections relate to the ephemeris time of the 1952 standard.

An impression has sometimes arisen that ephemeris time was in use from 1900:  this probably arose because ET, though proposed and adopted in the period 1948–1952, was defined in detail using formulae that made retrospective use of the epoch date of 1900 [[January 0]] and of [[Simon Newcomb|Newcomb]]'s [[Newcomb's Tables of the Sun|Tables of the Sun]].&lt;ref name=NewcSun&gt;[[#refNewcSun|S Newcomb (1895)]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For the components of the definition including its retrospective aspect, see [[#refClem1948|G M Clemence (1948)]], esp. p.172, and [[#refESAE|'ESAE 1961': 'Explanatory Supplement (1961)]], esp. pages 69 and 87.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ephemeris time of the 1952 standard leaves a continuing legacy, through its ephemeris second which became closely duplicated in the length of the current standard SI [[second]] (see below: [[#Redefinition of the second|Redefinition of the second]]).

==History (1952 standard)==
'''Ephemeris time''' ('''ET'''), adopted as standard in 1952, was originally designed as an approach to a uniform time scale, to be freed from the effects of irregularity in the rotation of the earth, "for the convenience of astronomers and other scientists", for example for use in [[ephemeris|ephemerides]] of the Sun (as observed from the Earth), the Moon, and the planets.  It was proposed in 1948 by [[Gerald Maurice Clemence|G M Clemence]].&lt;ref name=Clemence1948&gt;[[#refClem1948|G M Clemence (1948)]].&lt;/ref&gt;

From the time of [[John Flamsteed]] (1646–1719) it had been believed that the Earth's daily rotation was uniform.  But in the later nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, with increasing precision of astronomical measurements, it began to be suspected, and was eventually established, that the rotation of the Earth (''i.e.'' the length of the [[day]]) showed irregularities on short time scales, and was slowing down on longer time scales.  The evidence was compiled by [[Willem de Sitter|W de Sitter]] (1927)&lt;ref&gt;[[#refSitter1927|W de Sitter (1927)]].&lt;/ref&gt; who wrote "If we accept this hypothesis, then the 'astronomical time', given by the earth's rotation, and used in all practical astronomical computations, differs from the 'uniform' or 'Newtonian' time, which is defined as the independent variable of the equations of celestial mechanics".  De Sitter offered a correction to be applied to the mean solar time given by the Earth's rotation to get uniform time.

Other astronomers of the period also made suggestions for obtaining uniform time, including [[Andre Danjon|A Danjon]] (1929), who suggested in effect that observed positions of the Moon, Sun and planets, when compared with their well-established gravitational ephemerides, could better and more uniformly define and determine time.&lt;ref name=Clemence1971&gt;[[#refClem1971|G M Clemence (1971)]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus the aim developed, to provide a new time scale for astronomical and scientific purposes, to avoid the unpredictable irregularities of the [[Solar time#Mean solar time|mean solar time]] scale, and to replace for these purposes [[Universal Time]] (UT) and any other time scale based on the rotation of the Earth around its axis, such as [[sidereal time]].

[[Gerald Maurice Clemence|G M Clemence]] (1948)&lt;ref name="Clemence1948" /&gt; made a detailed proposal of this type based on the results of [[Harold Spencer Jones|H Spencer Jones]] (1939).&lt;ref name=HSJ1939&gt;[[#refHSJ1939|H Spencer Jones (1939)]].&lt;/ref&gt;  Clemence (1948) made it clear that his proposal was intended "for the convenience of astronomers and other scientists only" and that it was "logical to continue the use of mean solar time for civil purposes".&lt;ref&gt;[[#refClem1948|Clemence (1948)]], at p. 171.&lt;/ref&gt;

De Sitter and Clemence both referred to the proposal as 'Newtonian' or 'uniform' time. [[Dirk Brouwer|D Brouwer]] suggested the name 'ephemeris time'.&lt;ref name=ESAAp79&gt;[[#refESAA|ESAA (1992)]], see [https://books.google.com/books?id=uJ4JhGJANb4C&amp;pg=PA79 page 79].&lt;/ref&gt;

Following this, an astronomical conference held in Paris in 1950 recommended "that in all cases where the mean solar second is unsatisfactory as a unit of time by reason of its variability, the unit adopted should be the sidereal year at 1900.0, that the time reckoned in this unit be designated ''ephemeris time''", and gave Clemence's formula (see [[#Definition of ephemeris time (1952)|Definition of ephemeris time (1952)]]) for translating mean solar time to ephemeris time.

The [[International Astronomical Union]] approved this recommendation at its 1952 general assembly.&lt;ref name=ESAAp79 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;At the [[International Astronomical Union|IAU]] meeting in Rome 1952: see [[#refESAE|ESAE (1961)]] at sect.1C, p. 9;  also [[#refClem1971|Clemence (1971)]].&lt;/ref&gt;  Practical introduction took some time (see [[#Use of ephemeris time in official almanacs and ephemerides|Use of ephemeris time in official almanacs and ephemerides]]);  ephemeris time (ET) remained a standard until superseded in the 1970s by further time scales (see [[#Revision of time scales|Revision]]).
 
During the currency of ephemeris time as a standard, the details were revised a little. The unit was redefined in terms of the tropical year at 1900.0 instead of the sidereal year;&lt;ref name=ESAAp79 /&gt; and the standard second was defined first as 1/31556925.975 of the tropical year at 1900.0,&lt;ref name=ESAAp79 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;ESAA 1992, p. 79: citing decision of [[International Committee for Weights and Measures]] (CIPM), Sept 1954.&lt;/ref&gt; and then as the slightly modified fraction 1/31556925.9747 instead,&lt;ref&gt;[[#refESAA|ESAA (1992)]], see [https://books.google.com/books?id=uJ4JhGJANb4C&amp;pg=PA80 page 80], citing CIPM recommendation Oct 1956, adopted 1960 by the [[General Conference on Weights and Measures]] (CGPM).&lt;/ref&gt; finally being redefined in 1967/8 in terms of the cesium atomic clock standard (see below).

Although ET is no longer directly in use, it leaves a continuing legacy.  Its successor time scales, such as TDT, as well as the atomic time scale [[International Atomic Time|IAT (TAI)]], were designed with a relationship that "provides continuity with ephemeris time".&lt;ref name=ESAAp42&gt;[[#refESAA|ESAA (1992)]], at [https://books.google.com/books?id=uJ4JhGJANb4C&amp;pg=PA42 page 42].&lt;/ref&gt;  ET was used for the calibration of atomic clocks in the 1950s.&lt;ref name="Mark1958" /&gt;  Close equality between the ET second with the later [[Second#International second|SI second]] (as defined with reference to the cesium atomic clock) has been verified to within 1 part in 10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name="refMark1988"&gt;[[#refMark1988|Wm Markowitz (1988)]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In this way, decisions made by the original designers of ephemeris time influenced the length of today's [[Second#International second|standard SI second]], and in turn, this has a continuing influence on the number of [[leap second]]s which have been needed for insertion into current broadcast time scales, to keep them approximately in step with [[Solar time#Mean solar time|mean solar time]].

==Definition (1952)==
Ephemeris time was defined in principle by the orbital motion of the Earth around the Sun,&lt;ref name=ESAAp79 /&gt; (but its practical implementation was usually achieved in another way, see below).

Its detailed definition depended on [[Simon Newcomb]]'s [[Newcomb's Tables of the Sun|Tables of the Sun]] (1895),&lt;ref name=NewcSun /&gt; interpreted in a new way to accommodate certain observed discrepancies:

In the introduction to [[Newcomb's Tables of the Sun]] (1895) the basis of the tables (p.&amp;nbsp;9) includes a formula for the Sun's mean longitude, at a time indicated by interval T (in Julian centuries of 36525 mean solar days&lt;ref&gt;The unit of _mean solar_ day is left implicit on p.9 but made explicit on p.20 of [[#refNewcSun|Newcomb (1895)]].&lt;/ref&gt;) reckoned from Greenwich Mean Noon on 0 January 1900:

: Ls = 279° 41' 48".04 + 129,602,768".13T +1".089T&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; . . . . . (1)

Spencer Jones' work of 1939&lt;ref name="HSJ1939" /&gt; showed that the positions of the Sun actually observed, when compared with those obtained from Newcomb's formula, show the need for the following correction to the formula to represent the observations:

: &amp;Delta;Ls = + 1".00  + 2".97T  + 1".23T&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;  + 0.0748B

(where "the times of observation are in Universal time, not corrected to Newtonian time", and 0.0748B represents an irregular fluctuation calculated from lunar observations&lt;ref name=Clem1948-172&gt;[[#refClem1948|Clemence (1948)]], p.172, following [[#refHSJ1939|Spencer Jones (1939)]].&lt;/ref&gt;).

Thus a conventionally corrected form of Newcomb's formula, to incorporate the corrections on the basis of mean solar time, would be the sum of the two preceding expressions:

: Ls =	279° 41' 49".04 + 129,602,771".10T +2".32T&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; +0.0748B . . . . . (2)

Clemence's 1948 proposal did not adopt a correction of this kind in terms of mean solar time:  instead, the same numbers were used as in Newcomb's original uncorrected formula (1), but now in a reverse sense, to define the time and time scale implicitly, based on the real position of the Sun:

: Ls =	279° 41' 48".04 + 129,602,768".13E +1".089E&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; . . . . . (3)

where the time variable, here represented as E, now represents time in ephemeris centuries of 36525 ephemeris days of 86400 ephemeris seconds.  The 1961 official reference put it this way: "The origin and rate of ephemeris time are defined to make the Sun's mean longitude agree with Newcomb's expression"&lt;ref&gt;[[#refESAE|ESAE (1961)]] at p.70.&lt;/ref&gt;

From the comparison of formulae (2) and (3), both of which express the same real solar motion in the same real time but on different time scales, Clemence arrived at an explicit expression, estimating the difference in seconds of time between ephemeris time and mean solar time, in the sense (ET-UT):

: &lt;math&gt; \delta t = +24^s.349 + 72^s.3165T +29^s.949T^2 + 1.821B&lt;/math&gt; . . . . . (4)&lt;ref name=Clem1948-172 /&gt;

Clemence's formula, now superseded by more modern estimations, was included in the original conference decision on ephemeris time. In view of the fluctuation term, practical determination of the difference between ephemeris time and UT depended on observation.  Inspection of the formulae above shows that the (ideally constant) unit of ephemeris time such as the ephemeris second has been for the whole of the twentieth century very slightly shorter than the corresponding (but not precisely constant) unit of mean solar time (which besides its irregular fluctuations tends gradually to increase), consistently also with the modern results of Morrison and Stephenson&lt;ref name=morr3&gt;[[#morrste2004|L V Morrison &amp; F R Stephenson (2004)]]; also [[#stemorr84|F R Stephenson, L V Morrison (1984)]], and [[#stemorr95|F R Stephenson, L V Morrison (1995)]].&lt;/ref&gt; (see article [[delta T|&amp;Delta;T]]).

==Implementations==

===Secondary realizations by lunar observations===
Although ephemeris time was defined in principle by the orbital motion of the Earth around the Sun,&lt;ref&gt;[[#refClem1948|Clemence (1948)]], at pp.171-3.&lt;/ref&gt; it was usually measured in practice by the orbital motion of the Moon around the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refMark1955|W Markowitz &amp; others (1955)]]; [[#refMark1959|W Markowitz (1959)]]; also [[#refMark1958|W Markowitz, R G Hall, L Essen, J V L Parry (1958)]].&lt;/ref&gt;  These measurements can be considered as secondary realizations (in a [[metrology|metrological]] sense) of the primary definition of ET in terms of the solar motion, after a calibration of the mean motion of the Moon with respect to the mean motion of the Sun.&lt;ref name=guin88&gt;
[[#refGuin1988|B Guinot &amp; P K Seidelmann (1988)]], at p.305.&lt;/ref&gt;

Reasons for the use of lunar measurements were practically based: the Moon moves against the background of stars about 13 times as fast as the Sun's corresponding rate of motion, and the accuracy of time determinations from lunar measurements is correspondingly greater.

When ephemeris time was first adopted, time scales were still based on astronomical observation, as they always had been.  The accuracy was limited by the accuracy of optical observation, and corrections of clocks and time signals were published in arrear.

===Secondary realizations by atomic clocks===
A few years later, with the invention of the [[atomic clock|cesium atomic clock]], an alternative offered itself.  Increasingly, after the calibration in 1958 of the cesium atomic clock by reference to ephemeris time,&lt;ref name="Mark1958" /&gt; cesium atomic clocks running on the basis of ephemeris seconds began to be used and kept in step with ephemeris time.  The atomic clocks offered a further secondary realization of ET, on a quasi-real time basis&lt;ref name=guin88 /&gt; that soon proved to be more useful than the primary ET standard: not only more convenient, but also more precisely uniform than the primary standard itself. Such secondary realizations were used and described as 'ET', with an awareness that the time scales based on the atomic clocks were not identical to that defined by the primary ephemeris time standard, but rather, an improvement over it on account of their closer approximation to uniformity.&lt;ref&gt;[[#tr32-1306|W G Melbourne &amp; others, 1968]], section II.E.4-5, pages 15-16, including footnote 7, noted that the Jet Propulsion Laboratory spacecraft tracking and data reduction programs of that time (including the Single Precision Orbit Determination Program) used, as ET, the current US atomic clock time A.1 offset by 32.25 seconds. The discussion also noted that the usage was "inaccurate" (the quantity indicated was not identical with any of the other realizations of ET such as ET0, ET1), and that while A.1 gave "certainly a closer approximation to uniform time than ET1" there were no grounds for considering either the atomic clocks or any other measures of ET as (perfectly) uniform. Section II.F, pages 18-19, indicates that an improved time measure of (A.1 + 32.15 seconds), applied in the JPL Double Precision Orbit Determination Program, was also designated ET.&lt;/ref&gt; The atomic clocks gave rise to the [[International Atomic Time|atomic time scale]], and to what was first called Terrestrial Dynamical Time and is now [[Terrestrial Time]], defined to provide continuity with ET.&lt;ref name=ESAAp42 /&gt;

The availability of atomic clocks, together with the increasing accuracy of astronomical observations (which meant that relativistic corrections were at least in the foreseeable future no longer going to be small enough to be neglected),&lt;ref&gt;[[#refWink1977|G M R Winkler and T C van Flandern (1977)]].&lt;/ref&gt; led to the eventual replacement of the ephemeris time standard by more refined time scales including [[terrestrial time]] and [[barycentric dynamical time]], to which ET can be seen as an approximation.

==Revision of time scales==
In 1976 the [[International Astronomical Union|IAU]] resolved that the theoretical basis for its current (1952) standard of Ephemeris Time was non-relativistic, and that therefore, beginning in 1984, Ephemeris Time would be replaced by two relativistic timescales intended to constitute [[Dynamical time scale|dynamical timescales]]: [[Terrestrial Time#History|Terrestrial Dynamical Time (TDT)]] and [[Barycentric Dynamical Time|Barycentric Dynamical Time (TDB)]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#refIAU1976|IAU resolutions (1976)]]; see also ESAA (1992) [https://books.google.com/books?id=uJ4JhGJANb4C&amp;pg=PA41 at p.41].&lt;/ref&gt;  Difficulties were recognized, which led to these being in turn superseded in the 1990s by time scales [[Terrestrial Time|Terrestrial Time (TT)]], [[Geocentric Coordinate Time|Geocentric Coordinate Time GCT(TCG)]] and [[Barycentric Coordinate Time|Barycentric Coordinate Time BCT(TCB)]].&lt;ref name=ESAAp42 /&gt;

== JPL ephemeris time argument T&lt;sub&gt;eph&lt;/sub&gt; ==
High-precision [[ephemeris|ephemerides]] of sun, moon and planets were developed and calculated at the [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] (JPL) over a long period, and the latest available were adopted for the ephemerides in the [[Astronomical Almanac]] starting in 1984. Although not an IAU standard, the ephemeris time argument T&lt;sub&gt;eph&lt;/sub&gt; has been in use at that institution since the 1960s. The time scale represented by T&lt;sub&gt;eph&lt;/sub&gt; has been characterized as a [[principle of relativity|relativistic]] coordinate time that differs from [[Terrestrial Time]] only by small periodic terms with an amplitude not exceeding 2 milliseconds of time: it is linearly related to, but distinct (by an offset and constant rate which is of the order of 0.5&amp;nbsp;s/a) from the [[Barycentric Coordinate Time|TCB]] time scale adopted in 1991 as a standard by the [[IAU]]. Thus for clocks on or near the [[geoid]], T&lt;sub&gt;eph&lt;/sub&gt; (within 2 milliseconds), but not so closely TCB, can be used as approximations to Terrestrial Time, and via the standard ephemerides T&lt;sub&gt;eph&lt;/sub&gt; is in widespread use.&lt;ref name="EMS1998"/&gt;

Partly in acknowledgement of the widespread use of T&lt;sub&gt;eph&lt;/sub&gt; via the JPL ephemerides, IAU resolution 3 of 2006&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iau.org/static/resolutions/IAU2006_Resol3.pdf IAU 2006 resolution 3]&lt;/ref&gt; (re-)defined [[Barycentric Dynamical Time]] (TDB) as a current standard. As re-defined in 2006, TDB is a linear transformation of [[Barycentric Coordinate Time|TCB]]. The same IAU resolution also stated (in note 4) that the "independent time argument of the JPL ephemeris [[DE405]], which is called T&lt;sub&gt;eph&lt;/sub&gt;" (here the IAU source cites&lt;ref name="EMS1998"/&gt;), "is for practical purposes the same as [[Barycentric Dynamical Time|TDB]] defined in this Resolution". Thus the new TDB, like T&lt;sub&gt;eph&lt;/sub&gt;, is essentially a more refined continuation of the older ephemeris time ET and (apart from the {{nowrap|&lt; 2 ms}} periodic fluctuations) has the same mean rate as that established for ET in the 1950s.

==Use in official almanacs and ephemerides==
Ephemeris time based on the standard adopted in 1952 was introduced into the Astronomical Ephemeris (UK) and the [[American Ephemeris and Nautical Almanac]], replacing UT in the main ephemerides in the issues for 1960 and after.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refESAA|ESAA 1992]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=uJ4JhGJANb4C&amp;pg=PA612 at p.612].&lt;/ref&gt;  (But the ephemerides in the Nautical Almanac, by then a separate publication for the use of navigators, continued to be expressed in terms of UT.)  The ephemerides continued on this basis through 1983 (with some changes due to adoption of improved values of astronomical constants), after which, for 1984 onwards, they adopted the [[JPL]] ephemerides.

Previous to the 1960 change, the 'Improved Lunar Ephemeris' had already been made available in terms of ephemeris time for the years 1952-1959&lt;ref&gt;"Improved Lunar Ephemeris", US Government Printing Office, 1954.&lt;/ref&gt; (computed by [[Wallace John Eckert|W J Eckert]] from [[Ernest William Brown|Brown]]'s theory with modifications recommended by Clemence (1948)).

==Redefinition of the second==
Successive definitions of the unit of ephemeris time are mentioned above ([[#History of ephemeris time (1952 standard)|History]]).  The value adopted for the 1956/1960 standard second:

:the fraction 1/31 556 925.9747 of the [[tropical year]] for 1900 [[January 0]] at 12 hours ephemeris time.

was obtained from the linear time-coefficient in Newcomb's expression for the solar mean longitude (above), taken and applied with the same meaning for the time as in formula (3) above.  The relation with Newcomb's coefficient can be seen from:

:1/31 556 925.9747 = 129 602 768.13 / (360&amp;times;60&amp;times;60&amp;times;36 525&amp;times;86 400).

[[Caesium]] [[atomic clocks]] became operational in 1955, and quickly confirmed the evidence that the rotation of the earth fluctuated randomly.  This confirmed the unsuitability of the mean solar second of Universal Time as a measure of time interval for the most precise purposes.  After three years of comparisons with lunar observations, [[William Markowitz|Markowitz]] et al. (1958) determined that the ephemeris second corresponded to 9 192 631 770 ± 20 cycles of the chosen cesium resonance.&lt;ref name=Mark1958&gt;[[#refMark1958|W Markowitz, R G Hall, L Essen, J V L Parry (1958)]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Following this, in 1967/68, the General Conference on Weights and Measures (CGPM) replaced the definition of the [[Second#International second|SI second]] by the following:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The second is the duration of 9&amp;thinsp;192&amp;thinsp;631&amp;thinsp;770 periods of the radiation corresponding to the transition between the two hyperfine levels of the ground state of the caesium 133 atom.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Although this is an independent definition that does not refer to the older basis of ephemeris time, it uses the same quantity as the value of the ephemeris second measured by the cesium clock in 1958.  This [[Second#International second|SI second referred to atomic time]] was later verified by Markowitz (1988) to be in agreement, within 1 part in 10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;, with the second of ephemeris time as determined from lunar observations.&lt;ref name="refMark1988"/&gt;

For practical purposes the length of the ephemeris second can be taken as equal to the length of the second of [[Barycentric Dynamical Time|Barycentric Dynamical Time (TDB)]] or [[Terrestrial Time|Terrestrial Time (TT)]] or its predecessor TDT.

The difference between ET and UT is called [[ΔT]]; it changes irregularly, but the long-term trend is [[parabola|parabolic]], decreasing from ancient times until the nineteenth century,&lt;ref name=morr3 /&gt; and increasing since then at a rate corresponding to an increase in the solar day length of 1.7&amp;nbsp;ms per century (see [[leap second]]s).

[[International Atomic Time]] (TAI) was set equal to [[Universal Time|UT2]] at 1 January 1958 0:00:00 .  At that time, ΔT was already about 32.18 seconds.  The difference between Terrestrial Time (TT) (the successor to ephemeris time) and atomic time was later defined as follows:

:1977 January 1.000 3725 TT = 1977 January 1.000 0000 TAI, ''i.e.''

:TT − TAI = 32.184 seconds

This difference may be assumed constant—the rates of TT and TAI are designed to be identical.

'''Erich Traub''' (27 June 1906 – 18 May 1985) was a German [[veterinarian]], [[scientist]] and [[virologist]] who specialized in [[foot-and-mouth disease]], [[Rinderpest]] and [[Newcastle disease]].  Traub was a member of the [[National Socialist Motor Corps]] (NSKK), a [[Nazi]] motorist corps, from 1938 to 1942.  He worked directly for [[Heinrich Himmler]], head of the [[Schutzstaffel]] (SS), as the lab chief of the Nazis' leading [[bio-weapon]]s facility on [[Riems Island]].&lt;ref name="Carroll"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Traub was rescued from the Soviet zone of Germany after [[World War II]] and taken to the United States in 1949 under the auspices of the United States government program [[Operation Paperclip]], meant to exploit the post-war scientific knowledge in Germany, and deny it to the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name="Secret Agenda"&gt;

Traub worked at the [[University of Giessen]], Germany, from 1938 to 1942.&lt;ref name="Geissler"&gt;
{{cite book |title=Conversion of BTW Warfare facilities: Lessons from German History |last=Geissler |first=Erhard |year=1998 |publisher=Springer; 1st edition |isbn=978-0-7923-5250-1 |pages=53–66 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aUlRmq3VBrEC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traub was  a member of the Nazi NSKK, a motorist corps, from 1938 to 1942. The NSKK was declared a condemned, not a criminal organization at the Nuremberg trials.&lt;ref name="Carroll"/&gt;

From 1942 to 1948, Traub worked as lab-chief at the Reich Research Institute for Virus Diseases of Animals ({{lang-de|Reichsforschungsanstalt für Viruskrankheiten der Tiere}}) on [[Riems Island]] ({{lang-de|Insel Riems}}), a German animal virus research institute in the [[Baltic sea]], now named the [[Friedrich Loeffler Institute]].  The institute was headed by Prof. Dr. [[Otto Waldmann]] from 1919 to 1948, while Traub was vice-president.&lt;ref name="Geissler" /&gt;

The Institute at Riems Island was a dual use facility during the Second World War where at least some biological warfare experiments were conducted. It had been founded in 1909-10 to study foot-and-mouth disease in animals and by World War II employed about 20 scientists and a staff of 70-120. Hanns-Christoph Nagel, a veterinarian and biological warfare expert for the German Army, conducted experiments there, as did Traub.&lt;ref name="Geissler" /&gt;

The institute was administered under the ''Innenministerium'' (Ministry of the Interior), which [[Reichsführer-SS]] [[Heinrich Himmler]] took over in 1943. The chain of command was Himmler, Dr. [[Leonardo Conti]] (Reich Health Leader), [[Kurt Blome]], Waldmann, and then Traub.  Traub specialized in viral and bacterial diseases. He was assisted by [[Anna Bürger (scientist)|Anna Bürger]], who was later also brought to the United States after the war, to work with the Navy's biological warfare program.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aterriblemistake.com A Terrible Mistake: The Murder of Frank Olson and the CIA’s Secret Cold War Experiments] - H.P.Albarelli - July 1, 2009 - {{ISBN|0-9777953-7-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On orders from Himmler and Blome, the Deputy Reich Health Leader and head of the German biological warfare program, Traub worked on weaponizing foot-and-mouth disease virus, which has been reported to have been dispersed by aircraft onto cattle and reindeer in Russia.&lt;ref name="YeadonHawkins2008"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Glen Yeadon|author2=John Hawkins|title=The Nazi Hydra in America: Suppressed History of a Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vh7sx2xtjGEC&amp;pg=PA381|date=August 2008|publisher=Progressive Press|isbn=978-0-930852-43-6|page=381}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1944, Blome sent Traub to pick up a strain of [[Rinderpest]] virus in Turkey;  upon his return, this strain proved inactive (nonvirulent) and therefore plans for a Rinderpest product were shelved.&lt;ref name="Carroll"/&gt;

===Post-war===
Immediately after the war Traub was trapped in the Soviet zone of Allied occupied Germany.  He was forced to work for the Soviets from his lab on Riems Island.&lt;ref name="Carroll-10-11"&gt;
{{cite book |title=Lab 257: The Disturbing Story of the Government's Secret Germ Laboratory |last=Carroll |first=Michael |year=2004 |publisher=New York: HarperCollins Publishers |isbn=0-06-001141-6 |pages=10–11}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  In July 1948, the British evacuated Erich Traub from Riems Island as a "high priority Intelligence target" since it was now in the Soviet Zone and they feared that Traub was assisting in their biological warfare program. Traub denied this, however, claiming that his only interest was foot-and-mouth disease in animals.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Maddrell, 'Operation “Matchbox” and the Scientific Containment of the USSR', in P. Jackson &amp; J. Siegel (eds.), [https://books.google.com/books?id=I3Q3_Ww-5SMC Intelligence and Statecraft: The Use and Limits of Intelligence in International Society] ( Westport, CT : Praeger Publishers), (2005), pp. 173–206.&lt;/ref&gt;

Traub was brought to the United States in 1949 under the auspices of the United States government program [[Operation Paperclip]], meant to exploit scientific knowledge in Germany, and deny it to the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name="Secret Agenda" /&gt;  From 1949 to 1953, he was associated with the Naval Medical Research Institute in [[Bethesda, Maryland|Bethesda]], Maryland.&lt;ref name="Geissler" /&gt;

Months into his Operation Paperclip contract, Traub was asked to meet with US scientists from [[Fort Detrick]], the Army’s biological warfare headquarters, in Frederick, Maryland.  As a noted German authority on viruses he was asked to consult on their animal disease program from a Biological Warfare perspective. Traub discussed work done at the Reich Research Institute for Virus Diseases of Animals on Riems Island during World War II for the Nazis, and work done after the war there for the Russians. Traub gave a detailed explanation of the secret operation at the Institute, and his activities there.  This information provided the ground work for Fort Detrick's offshore germ warfare animal disease lab on [[Plum Island (New York)|Plum Island]].&lt;ref name="Carroll-7-8"/&gt;

His publicly published research from his time in the United States reports disease research not directly related to weaponization.  In 1951, he published a report for the Naval Medical Research Institute on Newcastle Disease virus in chicken and mammalian blood cells.&lt;ref&gt;Erich Traub, "Studies on the In-Vitro Multiplication of Newcastle Disease Virus in Chicken Blood."  Naval Medical Research Institute, National Naval Medical Center, 1951.&lt;/ref&gt;  Two years later, he published a paper for the Navy on the mechanisms of immunity in chickens to Newcastle and the possible role of cellular factors.&lt;ref&gt;Erich Traub, "Studies in the Mechanism of Immunity of Chickens to Newcastle Disease Virus." Naval Medical Research Institute, National Naval Medical Center, 1953.&lt;/ref&gt;  Also in 1953, he published another paper for the Navy with Worth I. Capps on the foot-and-mouth disease virus and methods for rapid adaptation.&lt;ref&gt;Erich Traub and Worth I. Capps, "Experiments with Chicken Embryo-Adapted Foot-and-Mouth Disease Virus and a Method for the Rapid Adaptation." Naval Medical Research Institute, National Naval Medical Center, 1953.&lt;/ref&gt;

Traub served as an expert on foot-and-mouth disease for the FAO of the UN in [[Bogota]], Colombia, from 1951 to 1952, in [[Tehran]], Iran, from 1963 to 1967, and in [[Ankara]], Turkey, from 1969 to 1971.

===Return to Germany===
[[File:Uff-Friedhof Denner Traub.jpg|thumb|upright|Tombstone]]
After working on biological research for the U.S. Navy from 1949 to 1953, Traub returned to Germany and founded a new branch of the Loeffler Institut in [[Tübingen]],  and headed it from 1953 to 1963.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fli.bund.de/9+M52087573ab0.html Friedrich-Loeffler-Institute, Federal Research Institute for Animal Health], History: Isle of Riems&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1960, Traub resigned as Tübingen’s director due to the scandal related to accusations of financial embezzlement. He continued with limited lab research for three more years, but then ended his career at Tübingen.&lt;ref name="Carroll-10-11" /&gt;

In 1964, Traub published a study for the Army Biological labs in Frederick, Maryland on [[Eastern equine encephalitis virus|Eastern Equine Encephalomyeltitis]] (EEE) immunity in white mice and its relationship to Lymphocytic choriomeningitis (LCM), which had long been a research interest of his.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Traub, "Immunity of White Mice to EEE-VIrus." Report No. 8, Army Biological Labs, Frederick, MD, 1964.&lt;/ref&gt;

He retired from the West German civil service in 1971. In 1972, on the occasion of the 500th anniversary of [[Ludwig Maximilians University of Munich]] Traub received an honorary doctorate degree in Veterinary Medicine for his achievements in basic and applied Virology (basic research on LCM; definition and diagnosis of type strains of FMD and their variants; development of adsorbate vaccines against fowl plague, Teschner disease of swine, and erysipelas of swine).

On May 18, 1985, Traub died in his sleep in West Germany. He was seventy-eight years old.&lt;ref name="Carroll-10-11" /&gt;

==Bio-weapon research==
{{off topic}}
In theory, insects of all types, particularly the biting species, can be used as disease vectors in a biological warfare program.  Germany, Japan, Britain, Russia and the U.S. all conducted experiments along these lines during the Second World War, and the Japanese used such insect-borne diseases against both soldiers and civilians in China.  This was one reason that President [[Franklin Roosevelt]] and Secretary of War [[Henry Stimson]] ordered the creation of an American biological warfare program in 1942, which was headquartered at [[Camp Detrick]], Maryland.  This eventually grew to a very large facility with 245 buildings and a $60 million budget, including an Entomological Weapons Department that mass-produced flies, lice and mosquitoes as disease vectors.  Although the British bio-weapon facility at [[Porton Down]] concentrated on the production of anthrax bombs, it also conducted experiments on insects as vectors.

After the war, the Army's 406th Medical General Laboratory in Japan cooperated with former scientists from Unit 731 in experimenting with many different insect vectors, including lice, flies, mosquitoes, ticks, fleas, spiders and beetles to carry a wide variety of diseases, from cholera to meningitis.  At Fort Detrick in the late 1940s, [[Theodore Rosebury]] also rated insect vectors very highly, and its entomological division had at least three insect-vectored weapons ready for use by 1950. Some of these were later tested at the [[Dugway Proving Grounds]] in Utah, and allegedly used during the [[Korean War]] as well.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey Alan Lockwood, ''Six-Legged Soldiers: Using Insects as Weapons of War''. Oxford, 2009, pp. 145-46; 160-61&lt;/ref&gt;

Traub visited the [[Plum Island Animal Disease Center]] (PIADC) in New York on at least three occasions in the 1950s. The Plum Island facility, operated by the Department of Agriculture, conducted research on [[foot-and-mouth disease|foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) of cattle]], one of Traub's areas of expertise.&lt;ref name="Carroll"/&gt; Traub was offered a leading position at Plum Island in 1958 which he officially declined.  It has been alleged that the United States performed [[bioweapon]]s research on Plum Island.&lt;ref name="Carroll"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Loftus, John (1982). The Belarus Secret. Knopf. {{ISBN|0-394-52292-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Fort Terry]] on Plum Island was part of the U.S. biological warfare program in 1944-46, working on veterinary testing in connection with the weaponization of [[brucellosis]].  After the war, research on biological weapons continued at [[Pine Bluff Chemical Activity|Pine Bluff]] in Arkansas and [[Fort Detrick]], Maryland, while officially at least Plum Island was transferred to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  From 1949, Plum Island also conducted work on biological weapons against animals and livestock, such as foot-and-mouth disease, Rinderpest, Newcastle disease, African swine fever and plague and malaria in birds.  Traub's research work from the Second World War onward involved at least the first three of these (all dangerous only to non-human animal species).&lt;ref&gt;John Ellis van Courtland Moon, "The U.S. Biological Weapons Program" in Mark Wheelis, Lajos Rozsa and Malcolm Dando (eds) [https://books.google.com/books?id=Usskez9NfEYC Deadly Cultures: Biological Weapons since 1945.] Harvard, 2006, pp. 9-46.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Georg von Peuerbach''' (also '''Purbach''', '''Peurbach''', '''Purbachius'''; born May 30, 1423 – April 8, 1461&lt;ref&gt;{{NDB|20|281|282|Peu(e)rbach (auch Purbach), Georg von (eigentlich Georg Aunpekh)|Hermann Haupt|118790684}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was an [[Austria]]n [[astronomer]], [[mathematician]] and instrument maker, best known for his streamlined presentation of [[Ptolemaic astronomy]] in the ''Theoricae Novae Planetarum.''

==Biography==
Little is known of Peuerbach's life before he enrolled at the [[University of Vienna]] in 1446.&lt;ref name="Britannica"&gt;{{cite web|last=Shank|first=Michael|title=Georg von Peuerbach|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/454669/Georg-von-Peuerbach|publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|accessdate=2014-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; He received his Bachelor of Arts in 1448. His curriculum was most likely composed primarily of humanities courses, as was usual at the time.&lt;ref name="O'Connor"&gt;{{cite web|title=Georg Peuerbach|url=http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Biographies/Peurbach.html|accessdate=2014-03-09|author=J. J. O'Connor|author2=E. F. Robertson}}&lt;/ref&gt; His knowledge of astronomy probably derived from independent study, as there were no professors of astronomy at the University of Vienna during Peuerbach's enrollment.&lt;ref name="O'Connor"/&gt;

From 1448 to 1451 Peuerbach traveled through central and southern Europe, most notably in [[Italy]], giving lectures on astronomy. His lectures led to offers of professorships at several universities, including those at [[Bologna]] and [[Padua]]. During this time he also met Italian astronomer [[Giovanni Bianchini]] of [[Ferrara]].&lt;ref name="O'Connor" /&gt; He returned to the University of Vienna in 1453, earned his Masters of Arts, and began lecturing on Latin poetry.&lt;ref name=Britannica /&gt;

In 1454 Peuerbach was appointed court astrologer to King [[Ladislas V]] of Bohemia and Hungary. It was in this capacity that Peuerbach first met Ladislas' cousin Frederick who was then serving as guardian to the 14-year-old king and who would later become [[Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor]]. Ladislas resided primarily in Prague and Vienna, allowing Peuerbach to maintain his position at the University of Vienna. During this time Peuerbach met Johannes Müller von Königsberg, better known as [[Regiomontanus]]. Müller was currently a student at the university and, after he graduated in 1452 at the age of 15, began collaborating extensively with Peuerbach in his astronomical work.&lt;ref name="O'Connor" /&gt;

In 1457, following the assassination of two notable political figures, Ladislas fled Vienna. He died of Leukemia later that year. Rather than taking of service with either of Ladislas' Successors, Peuerbach accepted an appointment as court astrologer to Frederick III.&lt;ref name="O'Connor" /&gt;

==Works==
One of Peuerbach's best known works is his ''Theoricae Novae Planetarum.'' It began as a series of lectures transcribed by Regiomontanus. The ''Theoricae Novae'' was an attempt to present Ptolemaic astronomy in a more elementary and comprehensible way. The book was very successful, replacing the older ''Theoricae Planetarum Communis'' as the standard university text on astronomy and was studied by many later-influential astronomers including [[Nicolaus Copernicus]] and [[Johannes Kepler]].&lt;ref name=Britannica /&gt;

In 1457 Peuerbach observed an eclipse and noted that it had occurred 8 minutes earlier than had been predicted by the [[Alfonsine tables|Alphonsine Tables]], the best available eclipse tables at the time. He then computed his own set of eclipse tables, the ''Tabulae Eclipsium.'' Widely read in manuscript form beginning around 1459 and formally published in 1514, these tables remained highly influential for many years.&lt;ref name=Britannica /&gt;&lt;ref name="O'Connor" /&gt;

Peuerbach wrote various papers on practical mathematics, and constructed various astronomical instruments. Most notably, he computed sine tables based on techniques developed by Arabian mathematicians.&lt;ref name=Britannica /&gt;

In 1460, Cardinal Johannes Bessarion, while visiting Frederick's court seeking assistance in a crusade to reclaim Constantinople from the Turks, proposed that Peuerbach and Regiomontanus create a new translation of Ptolemy's Almagest from the original Greek. Bessarion thought that a shorter and more clearly written version of the work would make a suitable teaching text. Peuerbach accepted the task and worked on it with Regiomontanus until his death in 1461, at which time 6 volumes had been completed. Regiomontanus completed the project, the final version containing 13 volumes.&lt;ref name="O'Connor" /&gt;

'''Guild socialism''' is a political movement advocating [[workers' control]] of industry [[Gremialismo|through the medium]] of trade-related [[guilds]] "in an implied contractual relationship with the public".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/248652/Guild-Socialism "Guild Socialism".  Encyclopædia Britannica. Encyclopædia Britannica Online. Encyclopædia Britannica Inc., 2012. Web. 31 May. 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; It originated in the [[United Kingdom]] and was at its most influential in the first quarter of the 20th century. It was strongly associated with [[G. D. H. Cole]] and influenced by the ideas of [[William Morris]].

== History and development ==

Guild socialism was partly inspired by the [[guild]]s of [[artisan|craftsmen]] and other skilled workers which had existed in [[England in the Middle Ages]]. In 1906, [[Arthur Penty]] published ''Restoration of the Gild System'' in which he opposed factory production and advocated a return to an earlier period of artisanal production organised through guilds.&lt;ref name="PH94"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hirst|first=Paul|authorlink=Paul Hirst|title=Associative Democracy: New Forms of Economic and Social Governance|year=1994|publisher=Polity Press|isbn=9780745609522}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|102}} The following year, the journal ''[[The New Age]]'' became an advocate of guild socialism, although in the context of modern industry rather than the medieval setting favoured by Penty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Martin|first=Wallace|title="The New Age" under Orage|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=KD28AAAAIAAJ&amp;lpg=PA209&amp;dq=%22The%20New%20Age%22%20guild%20socialism&amp;pg=PA206#v=onepage&amp;q=%22The%20New%20Age%22%20guild%20socialism&amp;f=false|year=1967|publisher=Manchester University Press|page=206}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1914, [[Samuel George Hobson|S. G. Hobson]], a leading contributor to ''The New Age'', published ''National Guilds: An Inquiry into the Wage System and the Way Out''. In this work, guilds were presented as an alternative to state control of industry or conventional [[labor union|trade union]] activity. Guilds, unlike the existing trade unions, would not confine their demands to matters of wages and conditions but would seek to obtain control of industry for the workers whom they represented. Ultimately, industrial guilds would serve as the organs through which industry would be organised in a future socialist society.

The guild socialists "stood for state ownership of industry, combined with ‘workers’ control’ through delegation of authority to national guilds organized internally on democratic lines. About the state itself they differed, some believing it would remain more or less in its existing form and others that it would be transformed into a federal body representing the workers’ guilds, consumers’ organizations, local government bodies, and other social structures."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/248652/Guild-Socialism "Guild Socialism".  Encyclopædia Britannica. Encyclopædia Britannica Online. Encyclopædia Britannica Inc., 2012. Web. 31 May. 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ernst Wigforss]]—a leading theorist of the [[Social Democratic Party of Sweden]]—was also inspired by and stood ideologically close to the ideas of [[Fabian Society]] and the guild socialism inspired by people like [[R. H. Tawney]], [[L.T. Hobhouse]] and [[J. A. Hobson]]. He made contributions in his early writings about [[industrial democracy]] and workers' self-management.

The theory of guild socialism was developed and popularised by G. D. H. Cole who formed the National Guilds League in 1915 and published several books on guild socialism, including ''Self-Government in Industry'' (1917) and ''Guild Socialism Restated'' (1920). A National Building Guild was established after [[World War I]] but collapsed after funding was withdrawn in 1921.&lt;ref name="PH94"/&gt;{{rp|110}}

Admiration of guild socialism led to a more "individualistic" form of it being suggested as a natural outcome for a united humanity in the science fiction work of Olaf Stapledon-although hundreds of years in the future.

Cole's ideas were also promoted by prominent anti-communist intellectuals&lt;ref&gt;“Origins of the Congress for Cultural Freedom, 1949-50.” Central Intelligence Agency, Central Intelligence Agency, 27 June 2008, www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/csi-studies/studies/95unclass/Warner.html. &lt;/ref&gt; such as the British logician [[Bertrand Russell]],{{fact|date=June 2018}} and the American liberal reformer [[John Dewey]]&lt;ref&gt;Ryan, Alan.

'''''Hawking'''''  is a BBC television film about [[Stephen Hawking]]'s early years as a PhD student at [[Cambridge University]], following his search for the [[beginning of time]], and his struggle against [[motor neuron disease]]. It stars [[Benedict Cumberbatch]] as Hawking and premiered in the UK in April 2004.

The film received acclaim, with critics particularly lauding Cumberbatch's performance as Hawking. It was nominated for Best Single Drama in the [[BAFTA]] TV Awards in 2005. Cumberbatch won the [[Golden Nymph]] for Best Performance by an Actor in a TV Film or Miniseries, and received his first nomination for a BAFTA TV Award for Best Actor.

Cumberbatch's portrayal of Hawking was the first portrayal of the physicist on screen not by himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=By Josh Dickey2014-09-08 07:43:45 UTC |url=http://mashable.com/2014/09/08/when-benedict-cumberbatch-played-stephen-hawking-its-all-on-youtube/ |title=When Benedict Cumberbatch Played Stephen Hawking: It's All on YouTube |publisher=Mashable.com |date=2014-09-08 |accessdate=2016-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;Hawking previously portrayed himself as a hologram in the ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' episode "[[Descent (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|Descent]]", and made multiple appearances voicing himself in [[The Simpsons]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
At [[Stephen Hawking]]'s 21st birthday party he meets a new friend, [[Jane Hawking|Jane Wilde]]. There is a strong attraction between the two and Jane is intrigued by Stephen's talk of stars and the universe, but realises that there is something very wrong with Stephen when he suddenly finds that he is unable to stand up. A stay in hospital results in a horrifying diagnosis. Stephen is suffering from motor neurone disease and doctors don't expect him to survive for more than two years. Stephen returns to Cambridge where the new term has started without him. But he cannot hide from the reality of his condition through work because he can't find a subject for his PhD. While his colleagues throw themselves into academic and college life, Stephen's life seems to have been put on hold. He rejects the help of his supervisor [[Dennis W. Sciama|Dennis Sciama]] and sinks into a depression. It is only Stephen's occasional meetings with Jane and her faith in him that seem to keep him afloat. The prevailing theory in cosmology at the time is [[Steady State theory|Steady State]], which argues that the universe had no beginning – it has always existed, and always will – and Steady State is dominated by Professor [[Fred Hoyle]], a plain-speaking [[Yorkshireman]], and one of the first science TV pundits. 

Stephen gets an early glimpse of a paper by Hoyle that is to be presented at a [[Royal Society]] lecture. He works through the calculations, identifies a mistake, and publicly confronts Hoyle after the great man has finished speaking. The row causes a stir in the department but, more importantly, it seems to give Stephen the confidence to get started on his own work. At almost the same time Stephen is introduced to a new way of thinking about his subject by another physicist, [[Roger Penrose]]. [[Topology]] is an approach that uses concepts of shape rather than equations to think about the nature of the universe, and this proves to be the perfect tool for Stephen, who is starting to find it very difficult to write. Penrose's great passion is the fate of dying stars. When a star comes to the end of its life, it begins to collapse in on itself. His calculations suggest something extraordinary. The collapse of the dying star appears to continue indefinitely, until the star is infinitely dense, forming a [[black hole]] in space. And at the heart of this black hole, Penrose shows, is something scientists call a [[Gravitational singularity|singularity]]. It is this which leads Stephen to his PhD subject. He has always had a niggling scepticism about Steady State Theory, and now he can begin to see a way of explaining the revolutionary and highly controversial idea that the universe might have had a beginning. Sciama is sceptical but supportive – glad to see his student fired up and ready to work. Meanwhile, Stephen's condition continues to decline, he writes and walks with difficulty and his speech is starting to slur. But he now has a focus for his energies and, with the support of Jane, enters a new phase. He also commits to his relationship with her, asking her to marry him and in doing so exhibiting a defiant determination to survive.

With his mind fired up, Stephen begins to work away at the implications of Penrose's discovery and starts to home in on the idea of a singularity. With remarkable insight – a real Eureka moment – he asks himself: what would happen if you ran Penrose's maths backwards? Instead of something collapsing into nothingness, what if nothingness exploded into something? And what if you applied this not to a star but to the whole universe? Answer: the universe really could have originated in a [[Big Bang|big bang]]. At last, Stephen enters a period of feverish academic work. He applies Penrose's theorems for collapsing stars to the universe itself. Justifying Sciama's faith in him, he produces a PhD of real brilliance and profound implications. In theory, at least, the big bang could have happened. Two years after his initial diagnosis, Stephen is not only still very much alive, but has played a part in a great scientific breakthrough which revolutionises the way we think about the universe. Today, the scientific consensus is that the universe started with a big bang: billions of years ago, a cosmic explosion brought space and time into existence.

A secondary, interwoven storyline follows a different but connected scientific quest. Unknown to Hawking, just as he was being diagnosed in 1963, two American scientists were embarking on their own scientific mission. Their research was to produce hard evidence to support Hawking's theoretical work. We encounter [[Arno Allan Penzias]] and [[Robert Woodrow Wilson]] in a hotel room in Stockholm in 1978. They are being interviewed about their discovery on the eve of receiving the [[Nobel Prize for Physics]]. They describe how, in the hills above New Jersey, they scanned the skies with a [[Radio telescope|radio-telescope]], and began to pick up a strange radio signal from space. In time, the two scientists came to realise that they had detected the [[Cosmic microwave background radiation|left-over heat of the first, ancient explosion]] that had created the universe. They had found the [[Cosmic microwave background radiation|physical proof of the big bang]].

The '''history of condoms''' goes back at least several centuries, and perhaps beyond.  For most of their history, [[condom]]s have been used both as a method of [[birth control]], and as a protective measure against [[sexually transmitted disease]]s.  Condoms have been made from a variety of materials; prior to the 19th century, chemically treated linen and animal tissue (intestine or bladder) are the best documented varieties.  Rubber condoms gained popularity in the mid-19th century, and in the early 20th century major advances were made in manufacturing techniques.  Prior to the introduction of the [[combined oral contraceptive pill]], condoms were the most popular birth "control" method in the Western world.  In the second half of the 20th century, the low cost of condoms contributed to their importance in [[family planning]] programs throughout the developing world.  Condoms have also become increasingly important in efforts to fight the [[AIDS pandemic]]. The oldest condoms ever excavated were found in a cesspit located in the grounds of [[Dudley Castle]] and were made from animal membrane, the condoms dated back to as early as 1642.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Martin|first=James|title=Condoms Cathedrals and Caves - Europe for Visitors|url=http://goeurope.about.com/cs/sex/a/condom.htm|publisher=about.com|accessdate=21 December 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130205201853/http://goeurope.about.com/cs/sex/a/condom.htm|archivedate=5 February 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Antiquity to the Middle Ages for sex==
Whether condoms were used in ancient civilizations is debated by archaeologists and historians.&lt;ref name="collier"&gt;{{cite book |author=Aine Collier |title=The Humble Little Condom: A History | url=https://books.google.com/?id=53EsAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=The+Humble+Little+Condom:+A+History&amp;dq=The+Humble+Little+Condom:+A+History | page=371 |publisher=Prometheus Books |location=Buffalo, N.Y |year=2007 |isbn=1-59102-556-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|11}}  Societies in the ancient civilizations of Egypt, Greece, and Rome preferred small families and are known to have practiced a variety of birth control methods.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|12,16–17,22}}  However, these societies viewed [[birth control]] as a woman's responsibility, and the only well-documented contraception methods were female-controlled devices (both possibly effective, such as [[pessary|pessaries]], and ineffective, such as [[amulet]]s).&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|17,23}} The writings of these societies contain "veiled references" to male-controlled contraceptive methods that might have been condoms, but most historians interpret them as referring to [[coitus interruptus]] or [[anal intercourse]].&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|21,24}}

The [[loincloth]]s worn by Egyptian and Greek laborers were very spare, sometimes consisting of little more than a covering for the glans of the penis. Records of these types of loincloths being worn by men in higher classes have made some historians speculate they were worn during intercourse;&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|13–15,18–20}} others, however, are doubtful of such interpretations.&lt;ref name="youssef"&gt;{{cite journal| last = Youssef | first = H | date=1 April 1993| title = The history of the condom | journal = Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine | volume = 86 | pages = 226–228 | accessdate=| pmid = 7802734| issue = 4| pmc = 1293956}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Historians may also cite one legend of [[Minos]], related by [[Antoninus Liberalis]] in 150 AD, as suggestive of condom use in ancient societies. This legend describes a curse that caused Minos' semen to contain serpents and scorpions. To protect his sexual partner from these animals, Minos used a goat's bladder as a female condom.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|18}}&lt;ref name="youssef" /&gt;

Contraceptives fell out of use in Europe after the [[decline of the Western Roman Empire]] in the 5th century; the use of contraceptive pessaries, for example, is not documented again until the 15th century. If condoms were used during the Roman Empire, knowledge of them may have been lost during its decline.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|33,42}} In the writings of Muslims and Jews during the Middle Ages, there are some references to attempts at male-controlled contraception, including suggestions to cover the penis in tar or soak it in onion juice. Some of these writings might describe condom use, but they are "oblique", "veiled", and "vague".&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|38–41}}

==1500s to the 1800s==

===Renaissance===
[[Image:De Morbo Gallico.jpg|thumb|A page from ''De Morbo Gallico'' (The French Disease), Gabriele Falloppio's treatise on syphilis. Published in 1564, it describes what is possibly the first use of condoms.]]
Prior to the 15th century, some use of glans condoms (devices covering only the head of the penis) is recorded in Asia. Glans condoms seem to have been used for birth control, and to have been known only by members of the upper classes. In China, glans condoms may have been made of oiled silk paper, or of [[Condom#Lambskin|lamb intestines]]. In Japan, they were made of tortoise shell or animal horn.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|60–1}}

The first well-documented outbreak of what is now known as [[syphilis]] occurred in 1494 among French troops.&lt;ref name="Scars_of_Venus"&gt;{{cite book | author=Oriel, J.D. | title=The Scars of Venus: A History of Venereology | location=London | publisher= Springer-Verlag | year=1994 |isbn=0-387-19844-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The disease then swept across Europe. As [[Jared Diamond]] describes it, "when syphilis was first definitely recorded in Europe in 1495, its [[pustule]]s often covered the body from the head to the knees, caused flesh to fall from people's faces, and led to death within a few months." (The disease is less frequently fatal today.&lt;ref name="Diamond1"&gt;{{cite book | author=Diamond, Jared | year=1997 | title=Guns, Germs and Steel | location=New York | publisher=W.W. Norton | page=210 |isbn=0-393-03891-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;)  By 1505, the disease had spread to Asia, and within a few decades had "decimated large areas of China".&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|50,60}}

In 16th century Italy, [[Gabriele Falloppio]] authored the earliest uncontested description of condom use.  ''De Morbo Gallico'' ("The French Disease", referring to syphilis) was published in 1564, two years after Falloppio's death. In this tract, he recommended use of a device he claimed to have invented: linen sheaths soaked in a chemical solution and allowed to dry before use. The cloths he described were sized to cover the [[Glans penis|glans]] of the penis, and were held on with a ribbon.&lt;!--

After the publication of ''De Morbo Gallico'', use of penis coverings to protect from disease is described in a wide variety of literature throughout Europe. The first indication these devices were used for birth control, rather than disease prevention, is the 1605 theological publication ''De iustitia et iure'' (On justice and law) by Catholic theologian [[Leonardus Lessius]]: he condemned them as immoral.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|56}}  The first explicit description that ''un petit linge'' (a small cloth) was used to prevent pregnancy is from 1655: a French novel and play titled ''L'Escole des Filles'' (The Philosophy of Girls). In 1666, the English Birth Rate Commission attributed a recent downward fertility rate to use of "condons", the first documented use of that word (or any similar spelling).&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|66–8}}

In addition to linen, condoms during the [[Renaissance]] were made out of intestines and bladder. Cleaned and prepared intestine for use in glove making had been sold commercially since at least the 13th century.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|44–5}}  Condoms made from bladder and dating to the 1640s were discovered in an English privy; it is believed they were used by soldiers of [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]].&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|68–9}}  Dutch traders introduced condoms made from "fine leather" to Japan. Unlike the horn condoms used previously, these leather condoms covered the entire penis.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|61}}

===18th century===
Written references to condom use became much more common during the 18th century. Not all of the attention was positive: in 1708, [[John Campbell, 2nd Duke of Argyll|John Campbell]] unsuccessfully asked Parliament to make the devices illegal.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|73}}  Noted English physician Daniel Turner condemned the condom, publishing his arguments against their use in 1717. He disliked condoms because they did not offer full protection against syphilis. He also seems to have argued that belief in the protection condoms offered encouraged men to engage in sex with unsafe partners - but then, because of the loss of sensation caused by condoms, these same men often neglected to actually use the devices. The French medical professor [[Jean Astruc]] wrote his own anti-condom treatise in 1736, citing Turner as the authority in this area. Physicians later in the 18th century also spoke against the condom, but not on medical grounds: rather, they expressed the belief that contraception was immoral.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|86–8,92}}

The condom market grew rapidly, however. 18th century condoms were available in a variety of qualities and sizes, made from either linen treated with chemicals, or "skin" (bladder or intestine softened by treatment with [[sulphur]] and [[lye]]).&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|94–5}}  They were sold at pubs, barbershops, chemist shops, open-air markets, and at the theater throughout Europe and Russia.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|90–2,97,104}}  The first recorded inspection of condom quality is found in the [[Histoire de ma vie|memoirs of Giacomo Casanova]] (which cover his life until 1774): to test for holes, he would often blow them up before use.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|108}}&lt;ref name="youssef" /&gt;

[[Image:Condom 1900.jpg|thumb|left|A condom made from animal intestine circa 1900.]]
Couples in colonial America relied on female-controlled methods of contraception, if they used contraceptives at all. The first known documents describing American condom use were written around 1800, two to three decades after the [[American Revolutionary War]].&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|116–7}}  Also around 1800, linen condoms lost popularity in the market and their production ceased: they were more expensive and were viewed as less comfortable when compared to skin condoms.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|94–5}}

Up to the 19th century, condoms were generally used only by the middle and upper classes. One reason for the lack of condom use was that the working classes tended to lack education on the dangers of sexually transmitted infections. Perhaps more importantly, condoms were unaffordable for many: for a typical prostitute, a single condom might cost several months' pay.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|119–21}}

===Expanded marketing and introduction of rubber===
The early 19th century saw contraceptives promoted to the poorer classes for the first time: birth control advocates in England included [[Jeremy Bentham]] and [[Richard Carlile]], and noted American advocates included [[Robert Dale Owen]] and [[Charles Knowlton]]. Writers on contraception tended to prefer other methods of birth control, citing both the expense of condoms and their unreliability (they were often riddled with holes, and often fell off or broke), but they discussed condoms as a good option for some, and as the only contraceptive that also protected from disease.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|88,90,125,129–30}}  One group of British contraceptive advocates distributed condom literature in poor neighborhoods, with instructions on how to make the devices at home; in the 1840s, similar tracts were distributed in both cities and rural areas through the United States.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|126,136}}

From the 1820s through the 1870s, popular women and men lecturers traveled around America teaching about physiology and sexual matters. Many of them sold birth control devices, including condoms, after their lectures. They were condemned by many moralists and medical professionals, including America's first female doctor [[Elizabeth Blackwell]]. Blackwell accused the lecturers of spreading doctrines of "abortion and prostitution".&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|130–2}}  In the 1840s, advertisements for condoms began to appear in British newspapers, and in 1861 a condom advertisement appeared in the ''[[New York Times]]''.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|127,138}}

The [[vulcanized rubber|rubber vulcanization]] process was invented by [[Charles Goodyear]] in 1839, and patented in 1844.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Reprinted from ''India Rubber World'' | title = CHARLES GOODYEAR—The life and discoveries of the inventor of vulcanized India rubber | journal = Scientific American Supplement | issue = 787 | publisher = Munn &amp; Co.  | location = New York  | date = 1891-01-31 | url = http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/14009 | accessdate = 2008-06-08}}&lt;br /&gt;

A main advantage of rubber condoms was their reusability, making them a more economical choice in the long term. Compared to the 19th century rubber condoms, however, skin condoms were initially cheaper and offered better sensitivity. For these reasons, skin condoms remained more popular than the rubber variety. However, by the end of the 19th century "rubber" had become a euphemism for condoms in countries around the world.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|134–5,157,219}}  For many decades, rubber condoms were manufactured by wrapping strips of raw rubber around penis-shaped molds, then dipping the wrapped molds in a chemical solution to cure the rubber.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|148}}  The earliest rubber condoms covered only the glans of the penis; a doctor had to measure each man and order the correct size. Even with the medical fittings, however, glans condoms tended to fall off during use. Rubber manufacturers quickly discovered they could sell more devices by manufacturing full-length one-size-fits-all condoms to be sold in pharmacies.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|135}}

===Increased popularity despite legal impediments===
Distribution of condoms in the United States was limited by passage of the [[Comstock laws]], which included a federal act banning the mailing of contraceptive information (passed in 1873) as well as State laws that banned the manufacture and sale of condoms in thirty states.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|144,193}}  In [[Ireland]] the 1889 Indecent Advertisements Act made it illegal to advertise condoms, although their manufacture and sale remained legal.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|163–4,168}}  Contraceptives were illegal in 19th century Italy and Germany, but condoms were allowed for disease prevention.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|169–70}}  Despite legal obstacles, condoms continued to be readily available in both Europe and America, widely advertised under euphemisms such as ''male shield'' and ''rubber good''.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|146–7}}  In late 19th century England, condoms were known as "a little something for the weekend".&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|165}}  Only in the [[Republic of Ireland]] were condoms effectively outlawed. In Ireland their sale and manufacture remained illegal until the 1970s.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|171}}

Opposition to condoms did not only come from moralists: by the late 19th century many feminists expressed distrust of the condom as a contraceptive, as its use was controlled and decided upon by men alone. They advocated instead for methods which were controlled by women, such as diaphragms and spermicidal douches.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|152–3}}  Despite social and legal opposition, at the end of the 19th century the condom was the Western world's most popular birth control method. Two surveys conducted in New York in 1890 and 1900 found that 45% of the women surveyed were using condoms to prevent pregnancy.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|173–4}}  A survey in Boston just prior to [[World War I]] concluded that three million condoms were sold in that city every year.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|192–3}}

1870s England saw the founding of the first major condom manufacturing company, E. Lambert and Son of Dalston.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|165}} In 1882, German immigrant [[Julius Schmidt (condoms)|Julius Schmidt]] founded one of the largest and longest-lasting condom businesses, Julius Schmid, Inc. (he dropped the 't' from his name in an effort to appear less Jewish). This New York business initially manufactured only skin condoms (in 1890 he was arrested by [[Anthony Comstock]] for having almost seven hundred of the devices in his house).&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|154–6}}  In 1912, a German named [[Julius Fromm]] developed a new, improved manufacturing technique for condoms: dipping glass molds into a raw rubber solution.&lt;ref name="billy" /&gt; Called ''cement dipping'', this method required adding gasoline or benzene to the rubber to make it liquid.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|200}}  In America, Schmid was the first company to use the new technique. Using the new dipping method, French condom manufacturers were the first to add textures to condoms.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|169–70}}  Fromm was the first company to sell a branded line of condoms, Fromm's Act, which remains popular in Germany today.&lt;ref name="billy" /&gt;  The condom lines manufactured by Schmid, Shieks and Ramses, were sold through the late 1990s.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|154–6}}  Youngs Rubber Company, founded by Merle Youngs in late 19th century America, introduced Trojans.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|191}}

Beginning in the second half of the 19th century, American rates of sexually transmitted diseases skyrocketed. Causes cited by historians include effects of the [[American Civil War]], and the ignorance of prevention methods promoted by the Comstock laws.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|137–8,159}}  To fight the growing epidemic, sexual education classes were introduced to public schools for the first time, teaching about venereal diseases and how they were transmitted. They generally taught that abstinence was the only way to avoid sexually transmitted diseases.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|179–80}}  Condoms were not promoted for disease prevention; the medical community and moral watchdogs considered STDs to be punishment for sexual misbehavior. The stigma on victims of these diseases was so great that many hospitals refused to treat people who had syphilis.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|176}}

==1900 to present==

===World War I to the 1920s===
[[Image:Surgeon Sage Says.jpg|thumb|A World War I-era U.S. military poster promoting abstinence.]]
The German military was the first to promote condom use among its soldiers, beginning in the second half of the 19th century.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|169,181}}  Early 20th century experiments by the American military concluded that providing condoms to soldiers significantly lowered rates of sexually transmitted diseases.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|180–3}}  During [[World War I]], the United States and (at the beginning of the war only) Britain were the only countries with soldiers in Europe who did not provide condoms and promote their use.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|187–90}}  By the end of the war, the American military had diagnosed almost 400,000 cases of syphilis and [[gonorrhea]], a historic high.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|191}}

From just before 1900 to the beginning of World War I, almost all condoms used in Europe were imported from Germany. Germany not only exported condoms to other European countries, but was a major supplier to Australia, New Zealand, and Canada. During the war, the American companies Schmid and Youngs became the main suppliers of condoms to the European [[Allies of World War I|Allies]].&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|156,170,191}}  By the early 1920s, however, most of Europe's condoms were once again made in Germany.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|199}}

In 1918, just before the end of the war, an American court overturned a conviction against [[Margaret Sanger]]. In this case, the judge ruled that condoms could be legally advertised and sold for the prevention of disease.&lt;!--
 --&gt;&lt;ref name="note"&gt;{{cite web | title = Biographical Note | work = The Margaret Sanger Papers | publisher = Sophia Smith Collection, Smith College, Northampton, Mass. | year = 1995 | url = http://asteria.fivecolleges.edu/findaids/sophiasmith/mnsss43_bioghist.html | accessdate = 2006-10-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; {{Dubious|date=September 2016}}  There were still a few state laws against buying and selling contraceptives, and advertising condoms as birth control devices remained illegal in over thirty states.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|266}}  But condoms began to be publicly, legally sold to Americans for the first time in forty-five years.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|192–3}}  Through the 1920s, catchy names and slick packaging became an increasingly important marketing technique for many consumer items, including condoms and cigarettes.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|197}}  Quality testing became more common, involving filling each condom with air followed by one of several methods intended to detect loss of pressure. Several American companies sold their rejects under cheaper brand names rather than discarding them.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|204,206,221–2}}  Consumers were advised to perform similar tests themselves before use, although few actually did so.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|223}}  Worldwide, condoms sales doubled in the 1920s.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|210}}

Still, there were many prominent opponents of condoms. Founder of psychoanalysis [[Sigmund Freud]] opposed all methods of birth control on the grounds that their failure rates were too high. Freud was especially opposed to the condom because it cut down on sexual pleasure. Some feminists continued to oppose male-controlled contraceptives such as condoms. Many moralists and medical professionals opposed all methods of contraception. In 1920 the Church of England's [[Lambeth Conferences#Sixth Conference (1920)|Lambeth Conference]] condemned all "unnatural means of conception avoidance."  London's Bishop [[Arthur Winnington-Ingram]] complained of the ''huge'' number of condoms discarded in alleyways and parks, especially after weekends and holidays.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|211–2}}

In the U.S., condom advertising was legally restricted to their use as disease preventatives. They could be openly marketed as birth control devices in Britain, but purchasing condoms in Britain was socially awkward compared to the U.S. They were generally requested with the euphemism "a little something for the weekend." [[Boots Group|Boots]], the largest pharmacy chain in Britain, stopped selling condoms altogether in the 1920s, a policy that was not reversed until the 1960s.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|208–10}}  In post-World War I France, the government was concerned about falling birth rates. In response, it outlawed all contraceptives, including condoms. Contraception was also illegal in Spain. European militaries continued to provide condoms to their members for disease protection, even in countries where they were illegal for the general population.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|213–4}}

===Invention of latex and manufacturing automation===
[[Latex]], rubber suspended in water, was invented in 1920. Youngs Rubber Company was the first to manufacture a latex condom, an improved version of their Trojan brand. Latex condoms required less labor to produce than cement-dipped rubber condoms, which had to be smoothed by rubbing and trimming. Because it used water to suspend the rubber instead of gasoline and benzene, it eliminated the fire hazard previously associated with all condom factories. Latex condoms also performed better for the consumer: they were stronger and thinner than rubber condoms, and had a shelf life of five years (compared to three months for rubber). Europe's first latex condom was an export from Youngs Rubber Company in 1929. In 1932 the London Rubber Company, which had previously served as a wholesaler for German-manufactured condoms, became Europe's first manufacturer of latex condoms, the Durex.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|199–200}}

Until the twenties, all condoms were individually hand-dipped by semiskilled workers. Throughout the decade of the 1920s, advances in automation of condom assembly line were made. Fred Killian patented the first fully automated line in 1930 and installed it in his manufacturing plant in Akron, Ohio. Killian charged $20,000 for his conveyor system - as much as $2 million in today's dollars. Automated lines dramatically lowered the price of condoms. Major condom manufacturers bought or leased conveyor systems, and small manufacturers were driven out of business.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|201–3}}  The skin condom, now significantly more expensive than the latex variety, became restricted to a niche high-end market.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|220}}

===Great Depression===
In 1927, senior medical officers in the American military began promoting condom distribution and educational programs to members of the army and navy. By 1931, condoms were standard issue to all members of the U.S. military.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|213–4}}  This coincided with a steep decline in U.S. military cases of sexually transmitted disease.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|217–9}}  The U.S. military was not the only large organization that changed its moral stance on condoms: in 1930 the Anglican Church's [[Lambeth Conferences#Seventh: 1930|Lambeth Conference]] sanctioned the use of birth control by married couples. In 1931 the [[National Council of Churches|Federal Council of Churches]] in the U.S. issued a similar statement.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|227}}

The Roman Catholic Church responded by issuing the encyclical ''[[Casti connubii]]'' affirming its opposition to all contraceptives, a stance it has never reversed.  [[Semen analysis]] was first performed in the 1930s. Samples were typically collected by masturbation, another action opposed by the Catholic Church. In 1930s Spain, the first use of [[collection condoms]] was documented; holes put in the condom allowed the user to collect a sample without violating the prohibitions on contraception and masturbation.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|228–9}}

In 1932, Margaret Sanger arranged for a shipment of [[Diaphragm (contraceptive)|diaphragms]] to be mailed from Japan to a sympathetic doctor in New York City. When U.S. customs confiscated the package as illegal contraceptive devices, Sanger helped file a lawsuit. In 1936, a federal appeals court ruled in [[United States v. One Package of Japanese Pessaries]] that the federal government could not interfere with doctors providing contraception to their patients.&lt;ref name="note" /&gt;  In 1938, over three hundred birth control clinics opened in America, supplying reproductive care (including condoms) to poor women all over the country.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|216,226}}  Programs led by U.S. [[Surgeon General of the United States|Surgeon General]] Thoman Parran included heavy promotion of condoms. These programs are credited with a steep drop in the U.S. STD rate by 1940.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|234}}

Two of the few places where condoms became more restricted during this period were [[Italian fascism|Fascist Italy]] and [[Nazi Germany]]. Because of government concern about low birth rates, contraceptives were made illegal in Italy in the late 1920s. Although limited and highly controlled sales as disease preventatives were still allowed, there was a brisk black market trade in condoms as birth control.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|254–5}}  In Germany, laws passed in 1933 mandated that condoms could only be sold in plain brown wrappers, and only at pharmacies. Despite these restrictions, when [[World War II]] began Germans were using 72 million condoms every year.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|252}}  The elimination of moral and legal barriers, and the introduction of condom programs by the U.S. government helped condom sales. However, these factors alone are not considered to explain the [[Great Depression]]'s booming condom industry. In the U.S. alone, more than 1.5 million condoms were used every day during the Depression, at a cost of over $33 million per year (not adjusted for inflation). One historian explains these statistics this way: "Condoms were cheaper than children."  During the Depression condom lines by Schmid gained in popularity: that company still used the cement-dipping method of manufacture. Unlike the latex variety, these condoms could be safely used with oil-based lubricants. And while less comfortable, older-style rubber condoms could be reused and so were more economical, a valued feature in hard times.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|217–9}}

More attention was brought to quality issues in the 1930s. In 1935, a biochemist tested 2000 condoms by filling each one with air and then water: he found that 60% of them leaked. The condom industry estimated that only 25% of condoms were tested for quality before packaging. The media attention led the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] to classify condoms as a drug in 1937 and mandate that every condom be tested before packaging. Youngs Rubber Company was the first to institute quality testing of every condom they made, installing automatic testing equipment designed by Arthur Youngs (the owner's brother) in 1938. The [[Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act]] authorized the FDA to seize defective products; the first month the Act took effect in 1940, the FDA seized 864,000 condoms. While these actions improved the quality of condoms in the United States, American condom manufacturers continued to export their rejects for sale in foreign markets.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|223–5}}

===World War II to 1980===
During [[World War II]] condoms were not only distributed to male U.S. military members, but enlisted men were also subject to significant contraception propaganda in the form of films, posters, and lectures.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|236–8,259}}  A number of slogans were coined by the military, with one film exhorting ''"Don't forget — put it on before you put it in."''&lt;ref name="pp" /&gt;  African-American soldiers, who served in segregated units, were exposed to less of the condom promotion programs, had lower rates of condom usage, and much higher rates of STDs.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|246}} America's female military units, the [[Women's Army Corps (United States Army)|WACs and WAACs]], were still engaged with abstinence programs.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|240}} European and Asian militaries on both sides of the conflict also provided condoms to their troops throughout the war, even Germany which outlawed all civilian use of condoms in 1941.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|252–4,257–8}}  Despite the rubber shortages that occurred during this period, condom manufacturing was never restricted.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|231–3}}  In part because condoms were readily available, soldiers found a number of [[Condom#Other uses|non-sexual uses]] for the devices, many of which continue to be utilized to this day.

Post-war American troops in Germany continued to receive condoms and materials promoting their use. Nevertheless, rates of STDs in this population began to rise, reaching the highest levels since World War I. One explanation is that the success of newer penicillin treatments led soldiers to take syphilis and gonorrhea much less seriously. A similar casual attitude toward STDs appeared in the general American population; one historian states that condoms "were almost obsolete as prophylaxis by 1960".&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|234,259–61}}  By 1947, the U.S. military was again promoting abstinence as the only method of disease control for its members, a policy that continued through the [[Vietnam War]].&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|261–2,281–4}}

But condom sales continued to grow. From 1955 to 1965, 42% of Americans of reproductive age relied on condoms for birth control. In Britain from 1950 to 1960, 60% of married couples used condoms. For the more economical-minded, cement-dipped condoms continued to be available long after the war. In 1957, Durex introduced the world's first lubricated condom. Beginning in the 1960s, the Japanese used more condoms per capita than any other nation in the world. The [[combined oral contraceptive pill|birth control pill]] became the world's most popular method of birth control in the years after its 1960 debut, but condoms remained a strong second. A survey of British women between 1966 and 1970 found that the condom was the most popular birth control method with single women. New manufacturers appeared in the Soviet Union, which had never restricted condom sales. The U.S. [[United States Agency for International Development|Agency for International Development]] pushed condom use in developing countries to help solve the "world population crises": by 1970 hundreds of millions of condoms were being used each year in India alone.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|267–9,272–5}}

In the 1960s and 1970s quality regulations tightened,&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|267,285}} and legal barriers to condom use were removed. In 1965, the U.S. Supreme Court case ''[[Griswold v. Connecticut]]'' struck down one of the remaining [[Comstock laws]], the bans of contraception in Connecticut and Massachusetts. France repealed its anti-birth control laws in 1967. Similar laws in Italy were declared unconstitutional in 1971.  [[Beate Uhse-Rotermund|Captain Beate Uhse]] in Germany founded a birth control business, and fought a series of legal battles continue her sales.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|276–9}}  In Ireland, legal condom sales (only to people over 18, and only in clinics and pharmacies) were allowed for the first time in 1978.  (All restrictions on Irish condom sales were lifted in 1993.)&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|329–30}}

Advertising was one area that continued to have legal restrictions. In the late 1950s, the American [[National Association of Broadcasters]] banned condom advertisements from national television. This policy remained in place until 1979, when the U.S. Justice department had it overturned in court.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|273–4,285}}  In the U.S., advertisements for condoms were mostly limited to men's magazines such as ''[[Penthouse (magazine)|Penthouse]]''.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|285–6}}  The first television ad, on the California station [[KNTV]], aired in 1975: it was quickly pulled after it attracted national attention.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|274}}  And in over 30 states, advertising condoms as birth control devices was still illegal.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|266}}

===After the discovery of AIDS===
The first ''[[New York Times]]'' story on acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ([[AIDS]]) was published on July 3, 1981.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|294}}  In 1982 it was first suggested that the disease was sexually transmitted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = A Cluster of Kaposi's Sarcoma and Pneumocystis carinii Pneumonia among Homosexual Male Residents of Los Angeles and range Counties, California | journal = Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report | volume = 31 | issue = 23 | pages = 305–7 | publisher =  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention | date = 1982-06-18 | url = https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00001114.htm | accessdate = 2008-06-15 | pmid = 6811844 | author1 = Centers for Disease Control (CDC)}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In response to these findings, and to fight the spread of AIDS, the U.S. Surgeon General Dr. [[C. Everett Koop]] supported condom promotion programs.  However, President [[Ronald Reagan]] preferred an approach of concentrating only on abstinence programs.  Some opponents of condom programs stated that AIDS was a disease of homosexuals and illicit drug users, who were just getting what they deserved.  In 1990, North Carolina senator [[Jesse Helms]] argued that the best way to fight AIDS would be to enforce state sodomy laws.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|296–7}}

Nevertheless, major advertising campaigns were put in print media, promoting condoms as a way to protect against AIDS.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|299,301}}  Youngs Rubber mailed educational pamphlets to American households, although the postal service forced them to go to court to do so, citing a section of Title 39 that "prohibits the mailing of unsolicited advertisements for contraceptives."  In 1983 the U.S. Supreme Court held that the postal service's actions violated the free speech clause of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]].&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|303}}  Beginning in 1985 through 1987, national condom promotion campaigns occurred in U.S. and Europe.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|299,301,306–7,312–8}} Over the 10 years of the Swiss campaign, Swiss condom use increased by 80%.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|314–7}} The year after the British campaign began, condom sales in the UK increased by 20%.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|309}}  In 1988 Britain, condoms were the most popular birth control choice for married couples, for the first time since the introduction of the pill.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|311}}  The first [[condom]] commercial on U.S. television aired during an episode of ''[[Herman's Head]]'' on November 17, 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F20614F63C5D0C7A8DDDA80994D9494D81&amp;showabstract=1| title = The Sponsor Is the Surprise In Fox's First Condom Ad | first = Stuart | last = Elliott | date = November 19, 1991 | work = [[The New York Times]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the U.S. in the 1990s, condoms ranked third in popularity among married couples, and were a strong second among single women.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|305}}

Condoms began to be sold in a wider variety of retail outlets, including in supermarkets and in discount department stores such as [[Wal-Mart]].&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|305}}  In this environment of more open sales, the British euphemism of "a little something for the weekend" fell out of use.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|322}}  In June 1991 America's first condom store, Condomania, opened on Bleecker Street in New York City.  Condomania was the first store of its kind in North America dedicated to the sale and promotion of condoms in an upbeat, upscale and fun atmosphere.  Condomania was also one of the very first retailers to offer condoms online when it launched its [https://www.condomania.com/ website] in December 1995.

Condom sales increased every year until 1994, when media attention to the AIDS pandemic began to decline.  In response, manufacturers have changed the tone of their advertisements from scary to humorous.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|303–4}}  New developments continue to occur in the condom market, with the first polyurethane condom—branded Avanti and produced by the manufacturer of Durex—introduced in the 1990s.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|324–5}}  Durex was also the first condom brand to have a website, launched in 1997.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|319}}  Worldwide condom use is expected to continue to grow: one study predicted that developing nations would need 18.6 billion condoms in 2015.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|342}}

==Etymology and other terms==
Etymological theories for the word "condom" abound. By the early 18th century, the invention and naming of the condom was attributed to an associate of England's [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]], and this explanation persisted for several centuries. However, the "Dr. Condom" or "Earl of Condom" described in these stories has never been proved to exist, and condoms had been used for over one hundred years before King Charles II ascended to the throne.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|54,68}}

A variety of Latin etymologies have been proposed, including ''condon'' (receptacle),&lt;!--

Other terms are also commonly used to describe condoms. In North America condoms are also commonly known as ''prophylactics'', or ''rubbers''. In Britain they may be called ''French letters''.&lt;!--

The insult term [[scumbag (disambiguation)|scumbag]] was originally a slang word for condom.&lt;ref&gt;American Journal of Orthopsychiatry, American Orthopsychiatric Association, 1939 http://english.stackexchange.com/questions/28253/origin-of-scumbag&lt;/ref&gt;

==Major manufacturers==
One analyst described the size of the condom market as something that "boggles the mind". Numerous small manufacturers, nonprofit groups, and government-run manufacturing plants exist around the world.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|322,328}}  Within the condom market, there are several major contributors, among them both for-profit businesses and philanthropic organizations.

In 1882, German immigrant Julius Schmidt founded one of the largest and longest-lasting condom businesses, Julius Schmid, Inc., based in New York City (he dropped the 't' from his name in an effort to appear less Jewish). The condom lines manufactured by Schmid included Sheiks and Ramses.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|154–6}}  In 1932, the London Rubber Company (which had previously been a wholesale business importing German condoms) began to produce latex condoms, under the Durex brand.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|199,201,218}}  In 1962 Schmid was purchased by London Rubber. In 1987, London Rubber began acquiring other condom manufacturers, and within a few years became an important international company. In the late 1990s, London Rubber (by then London International Limited) merged all the Schmid brands into its European brand, Durex.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|324–6}}  Soon after, London International was purchased by Seton Scholl Healthcare (manufacturer of Dr. Scholl's footcare products), forming [[SSL International|Seton Scholl Limited]].&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|327}}

Youngs Rubber Company, founded by Merle Youngs in late 19th century America, introduced the [[Trojan (condoms)|Trojan]] line of condoms.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|191}}  In 1985, Youngs Rubber Company was sold to Carter-Wallace. The Trojan name switched hands yet again in 2000 when Carter-Wallace was sold to [[Church and Dwight]].&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|323–4}}

The Australian division of [[Dunlop Rubber]] began manufacturing condoms in the 1890s. In 1905, Dunlop sold its condom-making equipment to one of its employees, Eric Ansell, who founded [[Ansell Limited|Ansell Rubber]]. In 1969, Ansell was sold back to Dunlop.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|327}}  In 1987, English business magnate [[Richard Branson]] contracted with Ansell to help in a campaign against HIV and AIDS. Ansell agreed to manufacture the Mates brand of condom, to be sold at little or no profit in order to encourage condom use. Branson soon sold the Mates brand to Ansell, with royalty payments made annually to the charity [[Virgin Unite]].&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|309,311}}&lt;!-- The ref says "Healthcare Foundation"; the name was changed to "Virgin Unite" in 2004--&gt;  In addition to its Mates brand, Ansell currently manufactures Lifestyles and Lifesan for the U.S. market.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|333}}

In 1934 the Kokusia Rubber Company was founded in Japan. It is now known as the Okamoto Rubber Manufacturing Company.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|257}}

In 1970 Tim Black and [[Phil Harvey|Philip Harvey]] founded Population Planning Associates (now known as [[Adam &amp; Eve (business)|Adam &amp; Eve]]). Population Planning Associates was a mail-order business that marketed condoms to American college students, despite U.S. laws against sending contraceptives through the mail. Black and Harvey used the profits from their company to start a non-profit organization [[Population Services International]]. By 1975, PSI was marketing condoms in Kenya and Bangladesh,&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|286–7,337–9}} and today operates programs in over sixty countries.&lt;!--

By selling the condoms instead of giving them away, DKT intends to make its customers invested in using the devices. One of DKT's more notable programs is its work in Ethiopia, where soldiers are required to carry a condom every time they leave base. The rate of HIV infection in the Ethiopian military, about 5%, is believed to be the lowest among African militaries.&lt;ref name="collier"/&gt;{{Rp|286–7,337–9}}

In 1987, Tufts University students Davin Wedel and Adam Glickman started Global Protection Corp. in response to C. Everett Koop's statement that "a condoms can save your life." Since that time, Global Protection Corp. has become known for its innovative approach to condom marketing and its support of more than 3500 non-profit organizations worldwide. The company has numerous patents and trademarks to its name, including the only FDA-approved glow-in-the-dark condom, the Pleasure Plus condom and the original condom keychain. In 2005 the company introduced its newest product, One Condoms. One represents a complete reinvention of retail condom brands, combining sleek metal packaging, innovative condom wrappers and innovative marketing programs. One is also the first condom brand to donate 5% of sales to the development of sexual health outreach and educational programs. In South Africa, some manufacturers have considered introducing an extra-large variety of condoms after several complaints from South African men claiming the condoms were too small and causing [[discomfort]].&lt;ref&gt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/4155390.stm&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hunveyor-1 terepasztal.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The test table for Hunveyor-1 and Husar-1 at Eotvos University, Budapest.]]

The '''HUSAR rover''' is part of the [[Hunveyor]] system. Like as Hunveyor (Hungarian UNiversity SURVEYOR) is an experimental university lander model, so the HUSAR is (Hungarian University Surface Analyser Rover) an experimental university rover model. This rover accompanies the Hunveyor as like Sojourner was accompanying the Mars Pathfinder lander. For the Hunveyor the Surveyor was the example, for the Husar-rover the [[Mars Pathfinder]]-Sojourner system was the example from the real space exploration world.

The Hunveyor-Husar system is an educational work at Hungarian Universities, Colleges and High Schools. There are smaller and larger model-cars supported by onboard computer, camera and some additional instrumentation. The building of the Husar-rover types is focusing on the basic planetary surface activities by moving vehicle. The rover has a solar panel on its board placed on a model-car chassis. In the Husar-b version the drive is on the back wheels by electric engines, movements are controlled by the camera view through a wireless connection to the computer. It can be used for roving among rocks and observing their surfaces. On a larger chassis Husar-2a version there are independent driving on all the four wheels. This fact allows directing a special movement. The rover can turn in a very narrow arc which is important to approach objects in side direction. The wheels in one axis are connected by a differential. The structural framework, the driving mechanism all have a left- and right-hand side symmetric structure. The movements are directed through servo engines, which were originally designed for analogous direction, however, even 8 of these servos can be directed by a microcontroller. This microcontroller gets the position of the servos through RS 232 port of the computer. The camera of Husar-2 transmits images with 30 frame/sec, and it has wireless connection with the computer (1200&amp;nbsp;MHz).

In a planetary simulation work we use testfields which are analog to a selected planetary surface. On the testfields (test table) the most important rock types from the [[Solar System]] are arranged around the Hunveyor and Husar. For example, desert sand morphology (according to the observations of [[Mars Pathfinder]]) can be modelled around lander and rover in order to give a real planetary environment for simulation studies. Complex studies of the main streams in the surface, wind system and rock interactions also can be modelled. (i.e. stream strength of the wind can be deciphered from the deposition of deflation style of the lee-forms). We show one of our test-fields around Hunveyor and Husar.

Husar rovers were built with Hunveyor-1, -2, and -4 landers, and they were independently built by the Husar-5 and Husar-6 groups at [[Budapest]], [[Pécs]], [[Székesfehérvár]], [[Sopron]] and Dorog.

Several cutaneous conditions can be diagnosed with the aid of [[immunofluorescence]] studies.

Cutaneous conditions with positive direct or indirect immunofluorescence when using salt-split skin include:
{| class="wikitable"
|+ Antibody isotype(s) and location of antibody deposition in immunofluorescence studies using salt-split skin for autoimmune bullous conditions targeting the basement membrane zone of the human integumentary system
|-
! Condition !! Antibody isotype(s) deposited !! Localization of antibody with use of salt-split skin
|-
| [[Antiepilegrin cicatricial pemphigoid]] || IgG || Dermal
|-
| [[Bullous lupus erythematosus]] || || Dermal
|-
| [[Bullous pemphigoid]] || [[IgG]] || Epidermal
|-
| [[Cicatricial pemphigoid]] || IgG || Epidermal
|-
| [[Epidermolysis bullosa acquisita]] || IgG || Dermal
|-

|-
| [[Orf-induced immunobullous disease]] || IgG || Dermal
|-
| [[Pemphigoid gestationis]] || IgG || Epidermal
|}

For several subtypes of [[pemphigus]] a variety of substrates are used for indirect immunofluorescence:
{| class="wikitable"
|+ Substrates used in indirect immunofluorescence studies for the different pemphigus variants
|-
! Pemphigus variant !! Substrate
|-
| [[Pemphigus foliaceous]] || Guinea pig esophagus
|-

|-
| [[IgA pemphigus]] || Cultured skin
|-
| [[Paraneoplastic pemphigus]] || Rat bladder
|}

[[File:Vitruvian macrocosm.jpg|thumb|[[Robert Fludd]]'s illustration of man as the microcosm within the universal macrocosm. Fludd states that "Man is a whole world of its own, called microcosm for it displays a miniature pattern of all the parts of the universe. Thus the head is related to the Empyreal, the chest to the ethereal heaven and the belly to the elementary substance."&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Fludd]] in ''Utriusque Cosmic Historia'', II; quoted by [[Pierre A. Riffard]] in ''Dictionnaire de l’ésotérisme'', Paris: Payot, 1983, 34.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

[[File:Despiciendo suspicio.PNG|right|250px|thumb|By looking down, I see up. Part of a pair of illustrations in Tycho Brahe's ''Astronomiæ instauratæ Mechanica'' depicting his understanding of the connection between macrocosm and microcosm.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}]]
[[File:Suspiciendo despicio.PNG|right|250px|thumb|By looking up, I see down.]]
'''Macrocosm and microcosm''' refers to a vision of [[cosmos]] where the part (microcosm) reflects the whole (macrocosm) and vice versa. It is a feature "present in all esoteric schools of thinking", according to scholar [[Pierre A. Riffard]].&lt;ref name = Riffard&gt;[[Pierre A. Riffard]], ''Dictionnaire de l’ésotérisme'', Paris: Payot, 1983, 34.&lt;/ref&gt; It is closely associated with [[Hermeticism]] and underlies practices such as [[astrology]], [[alchemy]] and [[sacred geometry]] with its premise of "As Above, So Below".&lt;ref name = Faivre&gt;[[Antoine Faivre]], ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=HXk9lnPx0_MC&amp;pg=PA12 Access to Western esotericism]'', State University of New York Press, 1994, 10-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, the concept of microcosm has been dominated by [[sociology]] to mean a small group of individuals whose behavior is typical of a larger social body encompassing it. A microcosm can be seen as a special kind of [[epitome]]. Conversely, a macrocosm is a social body made of smaller compounds. In physics, [[scale invariance]] describes the same phenomenon, although the universe as a whole is not physically scale invariant according to the modern understanding. However, scale invariance does appear in some physical systems, such as [[electrical breakdown]].

This theory was initiated by Pythagoras who saw the cosmos and the body as a harmonious unity. He expressed this connection with his concept of microcosm and macrocosm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=2017-07-28|title=Harmony in Healing|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.4324/9780203790281|journal=|volume=|pages=15-16|doi=10.4324/9780203790281|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Mad Scientist Toon Club''''' (aka '''''Mad Scientist Kids Club''''') is an [[educational]] [[children's television show]] produced by [[Saban Entertainment]] that aired in US syndication from September 15, 1993 to January 25, 1994. Each one-hour program (including commercials) mixed live action segments hosted by the scientist character "Dr. Pi" ([[Michael Sorich]]) and pre-existing [[Anime|Japanese animation]], including Saban's [[Tic Tac Toons]]. The format of the science portions was similar to [[Beakman's World]] and [[Bill Nye the Science Guy]] (all were produced in response to the 1990 [[Children's Television Act]]). Dr. Pi stood wearing a green lab coat and a backwards baseball cap, surrounded by a colorful set, and presented experiments that children could perform at home.

Any [[planet]] is an extremely faint light source compared to its parent [[star]]. For example, a [[star]] like the [[Sun]] is about a billion times as bright as the reflected light from any of the planets orbiting it. In addition to the intrinsic difficulty of detecting such a faint light source, the light from the parent star causes a glare that washes it out. For those reasons, very few of the [[extrasolar planet]]s reported {{as of|2014|04|lc=y}} have been observed directly, with even fewer being resolved from their host star.

Instead, [[astronomer]]s have generally had to resort to indirect methods to detect extrasolar planets. As of 2016, several different indirect methods have yielded success.

== Established detection methods ==
The following methods have at least once proved successful for discovering a new planet or detecting an already discovered planet:

=== Radial velocity ===
{{Main|Doppler spectroscopy|List of exoplanets detected by radial velocity}}

A star with a planet will move in its own small orbit in response to the planet's gravity. This leads to variations in the speed with which the star moves toward or away from Earth, i.e. the variations are in the [[radial velocity]] of the star with respect to Earth. The radial velocity can be deduced from the displacement in the parent star's [[spectral line]]s due to the [[Doppler effect]]. The radial-velocity method measures these variations in order to confirm the presence of the planet using the [[binary mass function]].

The speed of the star around the system's [[center of mass]] is much smaller than that of the planet, because the radius of its orbit around the center of mass is so small. (For example, the Sun moves by about 13&amp;nbsp;m/s due to Jupiter, but only about 9&amp;nbsp;cm/s due to Earth). However, velocity variations down to 1&amp;nbsp;m/s or even somewhat less can be detected with modern [[spectrometer]]s, such as the HARPS ([[High Accuracy Radial Velocity Planet Searcher]]) spectrometer at the [[ESO]] 3.6 meter telescope in [[La Silla Observatory]], Chile, or the [[W. M. Keck Observatory#Instruments|HIRES]] spectrometer at the [[Keck telescopes]].
An especially simple and inexpensive method for measuring radial velocity is "externally dispersed interferometry".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Until around 2012, the radial-velocity method (also known as [[Doppler spectroscopy]]) was by far the most productive technique used by planet hunters. (After 2012, the transit method from the [[Kepler spacecraft]] overtook it in number.) The radial velocity signal is distance independent, but requires high [[signal-to-noise ratio]] spectra to achieve high precision, and so is generally used only for relatively nearby stars, out to about 160 light-years from Earth, to find lower-mass planets. It is also not possible to simultaneously observe many target stars at a time with a single telescope. Planets of Jovian mass can be detectable around stars up to a few thousand [[Light-year|light years]] away. This method easily finds massive planets that are close to stars. Modern [[spectrograph]]s can also easily detect Jupiter-mass planets orbiting 10 [[astronomical unit]]s away from the parent star, but detection of those planets requires many years of observation. Earth-mass planets are currently detectable only in very small orbits around low-mass stars, e.g. [[Proxima b]].

It is easier to detect planets around low-mass stars, for two reasons: First, these stars are more affected by gravitational tug from planets. The second reason is that low-mass main-sequence stars generally rotate relatively slowly. Fast rotation makes spectral-line data less clear because half of the star quickly rotates away from observer's viewpoint while the other half approaches. Detecting planets around more massive stars is easier if the star has left the main sequence, because leaving the main sequence slows down the star's rotation.

Sometimes Doppler spectrography produces false signals, especially in multi-planet and multi-star systems. Magnetic fields and certain types of stellar activity can also give false signals. When the host star has multiple planets, false signals can also arise from having insufficient data, so that multiple solutions can fit the data, as stars are not generally observed continuously.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|arxiv=1310.6907|last1=Auriere|first1=Michel|title=Pollux: A stable weak dipolar magnetic field but no planet ?|journal=Proceedings of the International Astronomical Union|volume=9|pages=359–362|last2=Konstantinova-Antova|first2=Renada|last3=Espagnet|first3=Olivier|last4=Petit|first4=Pascal|last5=Roudier|first5=Thierry|last6=Charbonnel|first6=Corinne|last7=Donati|first7=Jean-Francois|last8= Wade|first8=Gregg A.|year=2013|doi=10.1017/S1743921314002476|bibcode=2014IAUS..302..359A}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the false signals can be eliminated by analyzing the stability of the planetary system, conducting [[Photometry (astronomy)|photometry]] analysis on the host star and knowing its rotation period and stellar activity cycle periods.

Planets with orbits highly inclined to the line of sight from Earth produce smaller visible wobbles, and are thus more difficult to detect. One of the advantages of the radial velocity method is that eccentricity of the planet's orbit can be measured directly. One of the main disadvantages of the radial-velocity method is that it can only estimate a planet's [[minimum mass]] (&lt;math&gt;M_\text{true} * {\sin i} \, &lt;/math&gt;). The posterior distribution of the inclination angle ''i'' depends on the true mass distribution of the planets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | bibcode = 2013PASP..125..933S | title=A Posteriori Transit Probabilities | journal=Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific | volume=125 | issue=930 | pages=933–950 | year=2013 | authors=Stevens, Daniel J.; Gaudi, B. Scott | doi=10.1086/672572 | arxiv=1305.1298}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, when there are multiple planets in the system that orbit relatively close to each other and have sufficient mass, orbital stability analysis allows one to constrain the maximum mass of these planets. The radial-velocity method can be used to confirm findings made by the [[#Transit method|transit method]]. When both methods are used in combination, then the planet's true mass can be estimated.

Although radial velocity of the star only gives a planet's minimum mass, if the planet's [[spectral line]]s can be distinguished from the star's spectral lines then the radial velocity of the planet itself can be found, and this gives the inclination of the planet's orbit. This enables measurement of the planet's actual mass. This also rules out false positives, and also provides data about the composition of the planet. The main issue is that such detection is possible only if the planet orbits around a relatively bright star and if the planet reflects or emits a lot of light.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|arxiv=1206.6197|last1=Rodler|first1=Florian|title=Weighing the Non-Transiting Hot Jupiter Tau BOO b|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|volume=753|issue=1|pages=L25|last2=Lopez-Morales|first2=Mercedes|last3=Ribas|first3=Ignasi|year=2012|doi=10.1088/2041-8205/753/1/L25|bibcode = 2012ApJ...753L..25R }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the [[Doppler spectroscopy|radial velocity method]] provides information about a planet's mass, the [[Photometry (astronomy)|photometric]] method can determine the planet's radius. If a planet crosses ([[Astronomical transit|transits]]) in front of its parent star's disk, then the observed visual brightness of the star drops by a small amount, depending on the relative sizes of the star and the planet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/5-ways-to-find-a-planet/#/2|title=5 Ways to Find a Planet|website=exoplanets.nasa.gov|access-date=2018-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in the case of [[HD 209458]], the star dims by 1.7%. However, most transit signals are considerably smaller; for example, an Earth-size planet transiting a Sun-like star produces a dimming of only 80 parts per million (0.008 percent).

This method has two major disadvantages. First, planetary transits are observable only when the planet's orbit happens to be perfectly aligned from the astronomers' vantage point. The probability of a planetary orbital plane being directly on the line-of-sight to a star is the ratio of the diameter of the star to the diameter of the orbit (in small stars, the radius of the planet is also an important factor). About 10% of planets with small orbits have such an alignment, and the fraction decreases for planets with larger orbits. For a planet orbiting a Sun-sized star at 1 [[Astronomical unit|AU]], the probability of a random alignment producing a transit is 0.47%. Therefore, the method cannot guarantee that any particular star is not a host to planets. However, by scanning large areas of the sky containing thousands or even hundreds of thousands of stars at once, transit surveys can find more extrasolar planets than the radial-velocity method.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Hidas, M.

The transit method has also the advantage of detecting planets around stars that are located a few thousand light years away. The most distant planets detected by [[Sagittarius Window Eclipsing Extrasolar Planet Search]] are located near the galactic center. However, reliable follow-up observations of these stars are nearly impossible with current technology.

The second disadvantage of this method is a high rate of false detections. A 2012 study found that the rate of false positives for transits observed by the [[Kepler mission]] could be as high as 40% in single-planet systems.&lt;ref name="Santerne2012"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Santerne | first1 = A. | last2 = Díaz | first2 = R.

The radial velocity method is especially necessary for Jupiter-sized or larger planets, as objects of that size encompass not only planets, but also brown dwarfs and even small stars. As the false positive rate is very low in stars with two or more planet candidates, such detections often can be validated without extensive follow-up observations. Some can also be confirmed through the transit timing variation method.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=O'Donovan |

[[Red giant]] branch stars have another issue for detecting planets around them: while planets around these stars are much more likely to transit due to the larger star size, these transit signals are hard to separate from the main star's brightness light curve as red giants have frequent pulsations in brightness with a period of a few hours to days. This is especially notable with [[subgiant]]s. In addition, these stars are much more luminous, and transiting planets block a much smaller percentage of light coming from these stars. In contrast, planets can completely occult a very small star such as a neutron star or white dwarf, an event which would be easily detectable from Earth. However, due to the small star sizes, the chance of a planet aligning with such a stellar remnant is extremely small.

[[File:Exoplanet Mass-Radius Scatter Super-Earth.png|thumb|400px|Properties (mass and radius) of planets discovered using the transit method, compared with the distribution, n (light gray bar chart), of minimum masses of transiting and non-transiting exoplanets. [[Super-Earth]]s are black.]]
The main advantage of the transit method is that the size of the planet can be determined from the lightcurve. When combined with the radial-velocity method (which determines the planet's mass), one can determine the density of the planet, and hence learn something about the planet's physical structure. The planets that have been studied by both methods are by far the best-characterized of all known exoplanets.&lt;ref name="charbonneautransitreview"&gt;{{cite conference | first=D. | last=Charbonneau |author2=T.

The transit method also makes it possible to study the atmosphere of the transiting planet. When the planet transits the star, light from the star passes through the upper atmosphere of the planet. By studying the high-resolution stellar spectrum carefully, one can detect elements present in the planet's atmosphere.  A planetary atmosphere, and planet for that matter, could also be detected by measuring the polarization of the starlight as it passed through or is reflected off the planet's atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Burrows|first=Adam S.|date=September 2014|title=Highlights in the study of exoplanet atmospheres|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature13782|journal=Nature|volume=513|issue=7518|pages=345–352|doi=10.1038/nature13782|issn=0028-0836|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, the secondary eclipse (when the planet is blocked by its star) allows direct measurement of the planet's radiation and helps to constrain the planet's orbital eccentricity without needing the presence of other planets. If the star's [[photometry (astronomy)|photometric]] intensity during the secondary eclipse is subtracted from its intensity before or after, only the signal caused by the planet remains. It is then possible to measure the planet's temperature and even to detect possible signs of cloud formations on it. In March 2005, two groups of scientists carried out measurements using this technique with the [[Spitzer Space Telescope]]. The two teams, from the [[Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics]], led by [[David Charbonneau]], and the [[Goddard Space Flight Center]], led by L. D. Deming, studied the planets [[TrES-1]] and [[HD 209458b]] respectively.  The measurements revealed the planets' temperatures: 1,060 [[Kelvin|K]] (790°[[Celsius|C]]) for TrES-1 and about 1,130 K (860&amp;nbsp;°C) for HD 209458b.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Charbonneau | title=Detection of Thermal Emission from an Extrasolar Planet | journal=The Astrophysical Journal | date=2005 | volume=626 | issue=1 | pages=523–529 | url=http://www.iop.org/EJ/article/0004-637X/626/1/523/62152.html | doi=10.1086/429991 | last2=Allen | first2=Lori E. | last3=Megeath | first3=S.

====History====
A [[CNES|French Space Agency]] mission, [[COROT|CoRoT]], began in 2006 to search for planetary transits from orbit, where the absence of atmospheric [[Scintillation (astronomy)|scintillation]] allows improved accuracy.  This mission was designed to be able to detect planets "a few times to several times larger than Earth" and performed "better than expected", with two exoplanet discoveries&lt;ref&gt;"COROT surprises a year after launch", [http://www.esa.int/SPECIALS/COROT/SEMF0C2MDAF_0.html ESA press release 20 December 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; (both of the "hot Jupiter" type) as of early 2008. In June 2013, CoRoT's exoplanet count was 32 with several still to be confirmed. The satellite unexpectedly stopped transmitting data in November 2012 (after its mission had twice been extended), and was retired in June 2013.&lt;ref&gt;"01/2014 – CoRoT: collision evading and decommissioning", [http://smsc.cnes.fr/COROT/GP_actualite.htm#112012 CNES CoRoT News]&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2009, [[NASA]] mission [[Kepler Mission|Kepler]] was launched to scan a large number of stars in the constellation [[Cygnus (constellation)|Cygnus]] with a measurement precision expected to detect and characterize Earth-sized planets. The NASA [[Kepler Mission]] uses the transit method to scan a hundred thousand stars for planets. It was hoped that by the end of its mission of 3.5 years, the satellite would have collected enough data to reveal planets even smaller than Earth. By scanning a hundred thousand stars simultaneously, it was not only able to detect Earth-sized planets, it was able to collect statistics on the numbers of such planets around Sun-like stars.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kepler.nasa.gov/about/ Kepler Mission page]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 February 2011, the Kepler team released a list of 1,235 extrasolar planet candidates, including 54 that may be in the [[habitable zone]]. On 5 December 2011, the Kepler team announced that they had discovered 2,326 planetary candidates, of which 207 are similar in size to Earth, 680 are super-Earth-size, 1,181 are Neptune-size, 203 are Jupiter-size and 55 are larger than Jupiter. Compared to the February 2011 figures, the number of Earth-size and super-Earth-size planets increased by 200% and 140% respectively. Moreover, 48 planet candidates were found in the habitable zones of surveyed stars, marking a decrease from the February figure; this was due to the more stringent criteria in use in the December data. By June 2013, the number of planet candidates was increased to 3,278 and some confirmed planets were smaller than Earth, some even Mars-sized (such as [[Kepler-62c]]) and one even smaller than Mercury ([[Kepler-37b]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/|title=NASA Exoplanet Archive|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reflection/Emission Modulations ===
Short-period planets in close orbits around their stars will undergo reflected light variations because, like the [[Moon]], they will go through [[Planetary phase|phases]] from full to new and back again. In addition, as these planets receive a lot of starlight, it heats them, making thermal emissions potentially detectable. Since telescopes cannot resolve the planet from the star, they see only the combined light, and the brightness of the host star seems to change over each orbit in a periodic manner. Although the effect is small — the photometric precision required is about the same as to detect an Earth-sized planet in transit across a solar-type star – such Jupiter-sized planets with an orbital period of a few days are detectable by space telescopes such as the [[Kepler Space Observatory]]. Like with the transit method, it is easier to detect large planets orbiting close to their parent star than other planets as these planets catch more light from their parent star. When a planet has a high albedo and is situated around a relatively luminous star, its light variations are easier to detect in visible light while darker planets or planets around low-temperature stars are more easily detectable with infrared light with this method. In the long run, this method may find the most planets that will be discovered by that mission because the reflected light variation with orbital phase is largely independent of orbital inclination and does not require the planet to pass in front of the disk of the star. It still cannot detect planets with circular face-on orbits from Earth's viewpoint as the amount of reflected light does not change during its orbit.

The phase function of the giant planet is also a function of its thermal properties and atmosphere, if any. Therefore, the phase curve may constrain other planet properties, such as the size distribution of atmospheric particles. When a planet is found transiting and its size is known, the phase variations curve helps calculate or constrain the planet's [[albedo]]. It is more difficult with very hot planets as the glow of the planet can interfere when trying to calculate albedo. In theory, albedo can also be found in non-transiting planets when observing the light variations with multiple wavelengths. This allows scientists to find the size of the planet even if the planet is not transiting the star.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jenkins|first=J.M.|author2=Laurance R.

=== Relativistic beaming ===
A separate novel method to detect exoplanets from light variations uses relativistic beaming of the observed flux from the star due to its motion. It is also known as Doppler beaming or Doppler boosting. The method was first proposed by [[Abraham Loeb]] and Scott Gaudi in 2003
.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi= 10.1086/375551|arxiv=astro-ph/0303212|title=Periodic Flux Variability of Stars due to the Reflex Doppler Effect Induced by Planetary Companions|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|volume=588|issue=2|pages=L117|year=2003|last1=Loeb|first1=Abraham|last2=Gaudi|first2=B. Scott|bibcode = 2003ApJ...588L.117L }}&lt;/ref&gt; As the planet tugs the star with its gravitation, the density of photons and therefore the apparent brightness of the star changes from observer's viewpoint. Like the radial velocity method, it can be used to determine the orbital eccentricity and the minimum mass of the planet. With this method, it is easier to detect massive planets close to their stars as these factors increase the star's motion. Unlike the radial velocity method, it does not require an accurate spectrum of a star, and therefore can be used more easily to find planets around fast-rotating stars and more distant stars.

One of the biggest disadvantages of this method is that the light variation effect is very small. A Jovian-mass planet orbiting 0.025 AU away from a Sun-like star is barely detectable even when the orbit is edge-on. This is not an ideal method for discovering new planets, as the amount of emitted and reflected starlight from the planet is usually much larger than light variations due to relativistic beaming. This method is still useful, however, as it allows for measurement of the planet's mass without the need for follow-up data collection from radial velocity observations.

The first discovery of a planet using this method ([[Kepler-76b]]) was announced in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|arxiv=1304.6841|last1=Faigler|first1=Simchon|title=BEER analysis of Kepler and CoRoT light curves: I.

=== Ellipsoidal variations ===
Massive planets can cause slight tidal distortions to their host stars. When a star has a slightly ellipsoidal shape, its apparent brightness varies, depending if the oblate part of the star is facing the observer's viewpoint. Like with the relativistic beaming method, it helps to determine the minimum mass of the planet, and its sensitivity depends on the planet's orbital inclination. The extent of the effect on a star's apparent brightness can be much larger than with the relativistic beaming method, but the brightness changing cycle is twice as fast. In addition, the planet distorts the shape of the star more if it has a low semi-major axis to stellar radius ratio and the density of the star is low. This makes this method suitable for finding planets around stars that have left the main sequence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.universetoday.com/102112/using-the-theory-of-relativity-and-beer-to-find-exoplanets/|title=Using the Theory of Relativity and BEER to Find Exoplanets - Universe Today|work=Universe Today|date=2013-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pulsar timing ===
{{See also|List of exoplanets detected by timing}}
[[File:Artist's concept of PSR B1257+12 system.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Artist's impression of the pulsar [[PSR B1257+12|PSR 1257+12]]'s planetary system]]
A [[pulsar]] is a neutron star:  the small, ultradense remnant of a star that has exploded as a [[supernova]].  Pulsars emit radio waves extremely regularly as they rotate.  Because the intrinsic rotation of a pulsar is so regular, slight anomalies in the timing of its observed radio pulses can be used to track the pulsar's motion.  Like an ordinary star, a pulsar will move in its own small orbit if it has a planet.  Calculations based on pulse-timing observations can then reveal the parameters of that orbit.&lt;ref name="EXP3"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Townsend, Rich |title=The Search for Extrasolar Planets (Lecture) |publisher=Department of Physics &amp; Astronomy, Astrophysics Group, University College, London |date=27 January 2003 |url=http://www.star.ucl.ac.uk/~rhdt/diploma/lecture_2/ |accessdate=2006-09-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050915080856/http://www.star.ucl.ac.uk/~rhdt/diploma/lecture_2/ |archivedate=15 September 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This method was not originally designed for the detection of planets, but is so sensitive that it is capable of detecting planets far smaller than any other method can, down to less than a tenth the mass of Earth.  It is also capable of detecting mutual gravitational perturbations between the various members of a planetary system, thereby revealing further information about those planets and their orbital parameters. In addition, it can easily detect planets which are relatively far away from the pulsar.

There are two main drawbacks to the pulsar timing method: pulsars are relatively rare, and special circumstances are required for a planet to form around a pulsar. Therefore, it is unlikely that a large number of planets will be found this way.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|arxiv=1308.6308|last1= Sinukoff|first1= E.|title= Below One Earth Mass: The Detection, Formation, and Properties of Subterrestrial Worlds|journal= Space Science Reviews|volume= 180|issue= 1–4|pages= 71|last2=  Fulton|first2= B.|last3=  Scuderi|first3= L.|last4=  Gaidos|first4= E.|year= 2013|doi= 10.1007/s11214-013-0019-1|bibcode = 2013SSRv..180...71S }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, life ''as we know it'' could not survive on planets orbiting pulsars due to the intensity of high-energy radiation there.

In 1992, [[Aleksander Wolszczan]] and [[Dale Frail]] used this method to discover planets around the pulsar [[PSR 1257+12]].&lt;ref name=wolszczan&gt;{{cite journal | author = [[Aleksander Wolszczan|A.

=== Variable star timing ===
Like pulsars, some other types of [[Variable star#Pulsating variable stars|pulsating variable stars]] are regular enough that [[radial velocity]] could be determined purely [[photometry (astronomy)|photometrically]] from the [[Doppler shift]] of the pulsation frequency, without needing [[spectroscopy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|arxiv=1202.0105|last1=Shibahashi|first1=Hiromoto|title=FM stars: A Fourier view of pulsating binary stars, a new technique for measuring radial velocities photometrically|journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society|volume=422|issue=1|pages=738|last2= Kurtz|first2=Donald W.|year=2012|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2966.2012.20654.x|bibcode = 2012MNRAS.422..738S }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/kepler/news/keplerm-20120710_prt.htm|title=NASA - Mission Manager Update|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This method is not as sensitive as the pulsar timing variation method, due to the periodic activity being longer and less regular. The ease of detecting planets around a variable star depends on the pulsation period of the star, the regularity of pulsations, the mass of the planet, and its distance from the host star.

The first success with this method came in 2007, when [[V391 Pegasi b]] was discovered around a pulsating subdwarf star.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v449/n7159/abs/nature06143.html|title=A giant planet orbiting the /'extreme horizontal branch/' star V&amp;thinsp;391 Pegasi | volume=449 |issue=7159 | doi=10.1038/nature06143|pmid=17851517 |journal=Nature|pages=189–191|bibcode = 2007Natur.449..189S|year=2007 | last1 = Silvotti | first1 = R.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Transit timing ===
{{Main|Transit timing variation}}
[[File:201008-2a PlanetOrbits 16x9- Transit timing of 1-planet vs 2-planet systems.ogv|thumb|250px|Animation showing difference between planet transit timing of 1-planet and 2-planet systems. Credit: NASA/Kepler Mission.]]

The transit timing variation method considers whether transits occur with strict periodicity, or if there is a variation. When multiple transiting planets are detected, they can often be confirmed with the transit timing variation method. This is useful in planetary systems far from the Sun, where radial velocity methods cannot detect them due to the low signal-to-noise ratio. If a planet has been detected by the transit method, then variations in the timing of the transit provide an extremely sensitive method of detecting additional non-transiting planets in the system with masses comparable to Earth's. It is easier to detect transit-timing variations if planets have relatively close orbits, and when at least one of the planets is more massive, causing the orbital period of a less massive planet to be more perturbed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Miralda-Escude|title=Orbital perturbations on transiting planets: A possible method to measure stellar quadrupoles and to detect Earth-mass planets|date=2001|doi=10.1086/324279|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|volume=564|issue=2|pages=1019–1023|arxiv=astro-ph/0104034|bibcode = 2002ApJ...564.1019M }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Holman |author2=Murray| title=The Use of Transit Timing to Detect Extrasolar Planets with Masses as Small as Earth|date=2005 |doi=10.1126/science.1107822 |pmid=15731449|volume=307 |issue=5713 | pages = 1288–1291 |journal=Science |arxiv=astro-ph/0412028 |bibcode=2005Sci...307.1288H}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Agol|author2=Sari|author3=Steffen|author4=Clarkson|title=On detecting terrestrial planets with timing of giant planet transits|year=2005|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2966.2005.08922.x|journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society|volume=359|issue=2|pages=567–579 |arxiv=astro-ph/0412032|bibcode = 2005MNRAS.359..567A }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main drawback of the transit timing method is that usually not much can be learned about the planet itself. Transit timing variation can help to determine the maximum mass of a planet. In most cases, it can confirm if an object has a planetary mass, but it does not put narrow constraints on its mass. There are exceptions though, as planets in the [[Kepler-36]] and [[Kepler-88]] systems orbit close enough to accurately determine their masses.

The first significant detection of a non-transiting planet using TTV was carried out with NASA's [[Kepler_(spacecraft)|Kepler]] spacecraft.  The transiting planet [[Kepler-19b]] shows TTV with an amplitude of five minutes and a period of about 300 days, indicating the presence of a second planet, [[Kepler-19c]], which has a period which is a near-rational multiple of the period of the transiting planet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kepler.nasa.gov/news/nasakeplernews/index.cfm?FuseAction=ShowNews&amp;NewsID=148 Invisible World Discovered], NASA Kepler News, 8 September 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|arxiv=1109.1561|author1=Sarah Ballard |display-authors=4 |author2=Daniel Fabrycky |title=The Kepler-19 System: A Transiting 2.2 R_Earth Planet and a Second Planet Detected via Transit Timing Variations|journal=The Astrophysical Journal |volume=743 |issue=2 |pages=200 |date=2011 |author3=Francois Fressin |author4=David Charbonneau |author5=Jean-Michel Desert |author6=Guillermo Torres |author7=Geoffrey Marcy |author8=Burke |author9=Howard Isaacson|last10=Henze|first10=Christopher|last11= Steffen|first11=Jason H.|last12= Ciardi|first12=David R.|last13= Howell|first13=Steven B.|last14= Cochran|first14=William D.|last15=Endl|first15=Michael|last16= Bryson|first16=Stephen T.|last17= Rowe|first17=Jason F.|last18= Holman|first18=Matthew J.|last19= Lissauer|first19=Jack J.|last20= Jenkins|first20=Jon M.|last21=Still|first21=Martin|last22= Ford|first22=Eric B.|last23= Christiansen|first23=Jessie L.|last24= Middour|first24=Christopher K.|last25= Haas|first25=Michael R.|last26=Li|first26=Jie|last27= Hall|first27=Jennifer R.|last28=McCauliff|first28=Sean|last29= Batalha|first29=Natalie M.|last30= Koch|first30=David G.|doi=10.1088/0004-637X/743/2/200 |bibcode = 2011ApJ...743..200B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[circumbinary planet]]s, variations of transit timing are mainly caused by the orbital motion of the stars, instead of gravitational perturbations by other planets. These variations make it harder to detect these planets through automated methods. However, it makes these planets easy to confirm once they are detected.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

=== Transit duration variation ===
"Duration variation" refers to changes in how long the transit takes. Duration variations may be caused by an [[exomoon]], [[apsidal precession]] for eccentric planets due to another planet in the same system, or [[Tests of general relativity#Perihelion precession of Mercury|general relativity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv |eprint=1009.5905 |author1=Nascimbeni |author2=Piotto |author3=Bedin |author4=Damasso |title=TASTE: The Asiago Survey for Timing transit variations of Exoplanets |class=astro-ph.EP |date=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|arxiv=0806.0629 |author1=Pal |author2=Kocsis |title=Periastron Precession Measurements in Transiting Extrasolar Planetary Systems at the Level of General Relativity |journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society |volume=389 |issue=2008 |pages=191–198 |date=2008|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2966.2008.13512.x |bibcode = 2008MNRAS.389..191P }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first such confirmation came from [[Kepler-16b]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

=== Eclipsing binary minima timing ===
When a [[binary star]] system is aligned such that – from the Earth's point of view – the stars pass in front of each other in their orbits, the system is called an "eclipsing binary" star system. The time of minimum light, when the star with the brighter surface is at least partially obscured by the disc of the other star, is called the primary [[eclipse]], and approximately half an orbit later, the secondary eclipse occurs when the brighter surface area star obscures some portion of the other star. These times of minimum light, or central eclipses, constitute a time stamp on the system, much like the pulses from a [[pulsar]] (except that rather than a flash, they are a dip in brightness). If there is a planet in circumbinary orbit around the binary stars, the stars will be offset around a binary-planet [[center of mass]]. As the stars in the binary are displaced back and forth by the planet, the times of the eclipse minima will vary. The periodicity of this offset may be the most reliable way to detect extrasolar planets around close binary systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Doyle|first=Laurance R. |first2=Hans-Jorg|last2=Deeg|date=2002|title=Timing detection of eclipsing binary planets and transiting extrasolar moons|pages=80|journal=Bioastronomy|volume=7|bibcode=2004IAUS..213...80D|arxiv = astro-ph/0306087 }} "Bioastronomy 2002: Life Among the Stars" IAU Symposium 213, R.P Norris and F.H.

=== Gravitational microlensing ===
{{Main|Gravitational microlensing|List of exoplanets detected by microlensing}}
[[File:Gravitational micro rev.svg|thumb|right|255px|Gravitational microlensing]]
Gravitational microlensing occurs when the gravitational field of a star acts like a lens, magnifying the light of a distant background star. This effect occurs only when the two stars are almost exactly aligned. Lensing events are brief, lasting for weeks or days, as the two stars and Earth are all moving relative to each other.  More than a thousand such events have been observed over the past ten years.

If the foreground lensing star has a planet, then that planet's own gravitational field can make a detectable contribution to the lensing effect. Since that requires a highly improbable alignment, a very large number of distant stars must be continuously monitored in order to detect planetary microlensing contributions at a reasonable rate. This method is most fruitful for planets between Earth and the center of the galaxy, as the galactic center provides a large number of background stars.

In 1991, astronomers Shude Mao and [[Bohdan Paczyński]] proposed using gravitational microlensing to look for binary companions to stars, and their proposal was refined by Andy Gould and [[Abraham Loeb]] in 1992 as a method to detect exoplanets. Successes with the method date back to 2002, when a group of Polish astronomers ([[Andrzej Udalski]], [[Marcin Kubiak]] and Michał Szymański from [[Warsaw]], and [[Bohdan Paczyński]]) during project OGLE (the [[Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment]]) developed a workable technique. During one month, they found several possible planets, though limitations in the observations prevented clear confirmation. Since then, several confirmed extrasolar planets have been detected using microlensing. This was the first method capable of detecting planets of Earth-like mass around ordinary [[main-sequence]] stars.&lt;ref name="Beaulieulensplanet" /&gt;

Unlike most other methods, which have detection bias towards planets with small (or for resolved imaging, large) orbits, the microlensing method is most sensitive to detecting planets around 1-10 astronomical units away from Sun-like stars.

A notable disadvantage of the method is that the lensing cannot be repeated, because the chance alignment never occurs again. Also, the detected planets will tend to be several kiloparsecs away, so follow-up observations with other methods are usually impossible. In addition, the only physical characteristic that can be determined by microlensing is the mass of the planet, within loose constraints. Orbital properties also tend to be unclear, as the only orbital characteristic that can be directly determined is its current semi-major axis from the parent star, which can be misleading if the planet follows an eccentric orbit. When the planet is far away from its star, it spends only a tiny portion of its orbit in a state where it is detectable with this method, so the orbital period of the planet cannot be easily determined. It is also easier to detect planets around low-mass stars, as the gravitational microlensing effect increases with the planet-to-star mass ratio.

The main advantages of the gravitational microlensing method are that it can detect low-mass planets (in principle down to Mars mass with future space projects such as [[WFIRST]]); it can detect planets in wide orbits comparable to Saturn and Uranus, which have orbital periods too long for the radial velocity or transit methods; and it can detect planets around very distant stars. When enough background stars can be observed with enough accuracy, then the method should eventually reveal how common Earth-like planets are in the galaxy.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

Observations are usually performed using networks of [[robotic telescope]]s. In addition to the [[European Research Council]]-funded OGLE, the [[Microlensing Observations in Astrophysics]] (MOA) group is working to perfect this approach.

The PLANET ([[Probing Lensing Anomalies NETwork]])/RoboNet project is even more ambitious. It allows nearly continuous round-the-clock coverage by a world-spanning telescope network, providing the opportunity to pick up microlensing contributions from planets with masses as low as Earth's.

Planets are extremely faint light sources compared to stars, and what little light comes from them tends to be lost in the glare from their parent star. So in general, it is very difficult to detect and resolve them directly from their host star. Planets orbiting far enough from stars to be resolved reflect very little starlight, so planets are detected through their thermal emission instead. It is easier to obtain images when the star system is relatively near to the Sun, and when the planet is especially large (considerably larger than [[Jupiter]]), widely separated from its parent star, and hot so that it emits intense infrared radiation; images have then been made in the infrared, where the planet is brighter than it is at visible wavelengths. [[Coronagraph]]s are used to block light from the star, while leaving the planet visible. Direct imaging of an Earth-like exoplanet requires extreme [[optothermal stability]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|doi=10.1117/12.2188371|chapter=Advanced Mirror Technology Development (AMTD) thermal trade studies|title=Optical Modeling and Performance Predictions VII|volume=9577|pages=957703|series=Optical Modeling and Performance Predictions VII|year=2015|last1=Brooks|first1=Thomas|last2=Stahl|first2=H.

Direct imaging can give only loose constraints of the planet's mass, which is derived from the age of the star and the temperature of the planet. Mass can vary considerably, as planets can form several million years after the star has formed. The cooler the planet is, the less the planet's mass needs to be. In some cases it is possible to give reasonable constraints to the radius of a planet based on planet's temperature, its apparent brightness, and its distance from Earth. The spectra emitted from planets do not have to be separated from the star, which eases determining the chemical composition of planets.

Sometimes observations at multiple wavelengths are needed to rule out the planet being a [[brown dwarf]]. Direct imaging can be used to accurately measure the planet's orbit around the star. Unlike the majority of other methods, direct imaging works better with planets with [[Orbital inclination#Exoplanets and multiple star systems|face-on orbits]] rather than edge-on orbits, as a planet in a face-on orbit is observable during the entirety of the planet's orbit, while planets with edge-on orbits are most easily observable during their period of largest apparent separation from the parent star.

The planets detected through direct imaging currently fall into two categories. First, planets are found around stars more massive than the Sun which are young enough to have protoplanetary disks. The second category consists of possible sub-brown dwarfs found around very dim stars, or brown dwarfs which are at least 100 AU away from their parent stars.

Planetary-mass objects [[rogue planet|not gravitationally bound to a star]] are found through direct imaging as well.

Some projects to equip telescopes with planet-imaging-capable instruments include the ground-based telescopes [[Gemini Planet Imager]], [[VLT-SPHERE]], the [[Subaru (telescope)#Instruments|Subaru Coronagraphic Extreme Adaptive Optics (SCExAO)]] instrument, [[Palomar Observatory|Palomar Project 1640]], and the space telescope [[WFIRST-AFTA]]. The [[New Worlds Mission]] proposes a large occulter in space designed to block the light of nearby stars in order to observe their orbiting planets. This could be used with existing, already planned or new, purpose-built, telescopes.

In 2010, a team from [[NASA]]s [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] demonstrated that a [[vortex coronagraph]] could enable small scopes to directly image planets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.space.com/8216-method-photograph-earth-planets.html|title=New method could image Earth-like planets|work=space.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; They did this by imaging the previously imaged [[HR 8799]] planets, using just a 1.5 meter-wide portion of the [[Hale Telescope]].

Another promising approach is [[nulling interferometry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.cfm?release=2010-207|title=News - Earth-like Planets May Be Ready for Their Close-Up|work=NASA/JPL}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has also been proposed that space-telescopes that focus light using [[Fresnel imager|zone plates]] instead of mirrors would provide higher-contrast imaging, and be cheaper to launch into space due to being able to fold up the lightweight foil zone plate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/node/21556552 Twinkle, twinkle, little planet], The Economist, 9 June 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Polarimetry ===
{{Main|Polarimetry}}
Light given off by a star is un-polarized, i.e. the direction of oscillation of the light wave is random.  However, when the light is reflected off the atmosphere of a planet, the light waves interact with the molecules in the atmosphere and become polarized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Schmid, H. M. | title=Search and investigation of extra-solar planets with polarimetry | journal=Direct Imaging of Exoplanets: Science &amp; Techniques.

By analyzing the polarization in the combined light of the planet and star (about one part in a million), these measurements can in principle be made with very high sensitivity, as polarimetry is not limited by the stability of the Earth's atmosphere. Another main advantage is that polarimetry allows for determination of the composition of the planet's atmosphere. The main disadvantage is that it will not be able to detect planets without atmospheres. Larger planets and planets with higher albedo are easier to detect through polarimetry, as they reflect more light.

Astronomical devices used for polarimetry, called polarimeters, are capable of detecting polarized light and rejecting unpolarized beams.

=== Astrometry ===
{{Main|Astrometry}}
[[File:orbit3.gif|thumb|right|200px|In this diagram a planet (smaller object) orbits a star, which itself moves in a small orbit. The system's center of mass is shown with a red plus sign. (In this case, it always lies within the star.)]]
This method consists of precisely measuring a star's position in the sky, and observing how that position changes over time. Originally, this was done visually, with hand-written records. By the end of the 19th century, this method used photographic plates, greatly improving the accuracy of the measurements as well as creating a data archive. If a star has a planet, then the gravitational influence of the planet will cause the star itself to move in a tiny circular or elliptical orbit. Effectively, star and planet each orbit around their mutual centre of mass ([[Barycentric coordinates (astronomy)|barycenter]]), as explained by solutions to the [[two-body problem]]. Since the star is much more massive, its orbit will be much smaller.&lt;ref name="EXP2"&gt;{{cite web | first= Amir | last= Alexander| title =Space Topics: Extrasolar Planets Astrometry: The Past and Future of Planet Hunting | url=http://www.planetary.org/explore/topics/extrasolar_planets/extrasolar/astrometry.html | publisher=The Planetary Society |accessdate= 2006-09-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Frequently, the mutual centre of mass will lie within the radius of the larger body. Consequently, it is easier to find planets around low-mass stars, especially brown dwarfs.

[[File:Solar system barycenter.svg|thumb|right|200px|Motion of the center of mass (barycenter) of solar system relative to the Sun]]
Astrometry is the oldest search method for [[extrasolar planets]], and was originally popular because of its success in characterizing [[Binary star#Astrometric binaries|astrometric binary star]] systems. It dates back at least to statements made by [[William Herschel]] in the late 18th century. He claimed that an ''unseen companion'' was affecting the position of the star he cataloged as ''[[70 Ophiuchi]]''. The first known formal astrometric calculation for an extrasolar planet was made by [[William Stephen Jacob]] in 1855 for this star.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

All claims of a ''planetary companion'' of less than 0.1 solar mass, as the mass of the planet, made before 1996 using this method are likely spurious. In 2002, the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] did succeed in using astrometry to characterize a previously discovered planet around the star [[Gliese 876]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Benedict | title=A Mass for the Extrasolar Planet Gliese 876b Determined from Hubble Space Telescope Fine Guidance Sensor 3 Astrometry and High-Precision Radial Velocities | journal=The Astrophysical Journal Letters | volume=581 | issue=2 | date=2002 | pages=L115–L118 | url=http://www.iop.org/EJ/article/1538-4357/581/2/L115/16766.html | doi=10.1086/346073 | last2=McArthur | first2=B.

The space-based observatory [[Gaia (spacecraft)|''Gaia'']], launched in 2013, is expected to find thousands of planets via astrometry, but prior to the launch of ''Gaia'', no planet detected by astrometry had been confirmed.

[[SIM PlanetQuest]] was a US project (cancelled in 2010) that would have had similar exoplanet finding capabilities to [[Gaia (spacecraft)|Gaia]].

One potential advantage of the astrometric method is that it is most sensitive to planets with large orbits.  This makes it complementary to other methods that are most sensitive to planets with small orbits.  However, very long observation times will be required&amp;nbsp;— years, and possibly decades, as planets far enough from their star to allow detection via astrometry also take a long time to complete an orbit.

Planets orbiting around one of the stars in binary systems are more easily detectable, as they cause perturbations in the orbits of stars themselves. However, with this method, follow-up observations are needed to determine which star the planet orbits around.

In 2009, the discovery of [[VB 10b]] by astrometry was announced. This planetary object, orbiting the low mass [[red dwarf]] star [[VB 10]], was reported to have a mass seven times that of [[Jupiter]]. If confirmed, this would be the first exoplanet discovered by astrometry, of the many that have been claimed through the years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

In 2018, a study comparing observations from the [[Gaia (spacecraft)|Gaia spacecraft]] to [[Hipparcos]] data  for the [[Beta Pictoris]] system was able to measure the mass of Beta Pictoris b, constraining it to {{val|11|2}} Jupiter masses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Snellen |first1=Ignas |last2=Brown |first2=Anthony |title=The mass of the young planet Pictoris b through the astrometric motion of its host star |journal=Nature Astronomy |volume=2 |issue=11 |pages=883–886 |date=20 August 2018 |doi=10.1038/s41550-018-0561-6 |arxiv=1808.06257 |issn=2397-3366}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is in good agreement with previous mass estimations of roughly 13 Jupiter masses.

== Other possible methods ==

=== Transit imaging ===
An optical/infrared [[interferometer]] array doesn't collect as much light as a single telescope of equivalent size, but has the resolution of a single telescope the size of the array. For bright stars, this resolving power could be used to image a star's surface during a transit event and see the shadow of the planet transiting. This could provide a direct measurement of the planet's angular radius and, via [[parallax]], its actual radius. This is more accurate than radius estimates based on [[transit photometry]], which are dependent on stellar radius estimates which depend on models of star characteristics. Imaging also provides more accurate determination of the inclination than photometry does.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|arxiv=1405.1983 |last1= van Belle |first1= Gerard T. |title= Direct Imaging of Planet Transit Events |journal= Proceedings of the International Astronomical Union |volume= 8 |pages= 378–381 |author2= Kaspar von Braun |last3= Boyajian |first3= Tabetha |last4= Schaefer |first4= Gail |year= 2014 |doi= 10.1017/S1743921313013197 |bibcode= 2014IAUS..293..378V }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Magnetospheric radio emissions ===
Radio emissions from magnetospheres could be detected with future radio telescopes. This could enable determination of the rotation rate of a planet, which is difficult to detect otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.ece.vt.edu/swe/lwa/memo/lwa0013.pdf |format=PDF| title=Radio Detection of Extrasolar Planets: Present and Future Prospects|work=NRL, NASA/GSFC, NRAO, Observatoìre de Paris|accessdate=2008-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Auroral radio emissions ===

== Detection of extrasolar asteroids and debris disks ==

=== Circumstellar disks ===
[[File:Massive Smash-Up at Vega.jpg|thumb|250px|right|An artist's conception of two [[Pluto]]-sized dwarf planets in a collision around [[Vega]] ]]
Disks of space dust ([[debris disk]]s) surround many stars.  The dust can be detected because it absorbs ordinary starlight and re-emits it as [[infrared]] radiation.  Even if the dust particles have a total mass well less than that of Earth, they can still have a large enough total surface area that they outshine their parent star in infrared wavelengths.&lt;ref name="greaveswyatt04"&gt;{{cite journal | author=J.S. Greaves |author2=M.C. Wyatt |author3=W.S. Holland |author4=W.F.R. Dent | title=The debris disk around tau Ceti:  a massive analogue to the Kuiper Belt | journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society | volume=351 | date=2004 | issue=3 | pages=L54 – L58 | doi=10.1111/j.1365-2966.2004.07957.x | bibcode=2004MNRAS.351L..54G}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Hubble Space Telescope]] is capable of observing dust disks with its NICMOS (Near Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer) instrument. Even better images have now been taken by its sister instrument, the [[Spitzer Space Telescope]], and by the [[European Space Agency]]'s [[Herschel Space Observatory]], which can see far deeper into [[infrared]] wavelengths than the Hubble can.  Dust disks have now been found around more than 15% of nearby sunlike stars.&lt;ref name="greaveswyatt03"&gt;{{cite conference | first=J.S. | last=Greaves |author2=M.C. Wyatt |author3=W.S. Holland |author4= W.F.R. Dent  | title=Submillimetre Images of the Closest Debris Disks | booktitle=Scientific Frontiers in Research on Extrasolar Planets | publisher=Astronomical Society of the Pacific | date=2003 | pages=239–244}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dust is thought to be generated by collisions among comets and asteroids. [[Radiation pressure]] from the star will push the dust particles away into interstellar space over a relatively short timescale. Therefore, the detection of dust indicates continual replenishment by new collisions, and provides strong indirect evidence of the presence of small bodies like comets and [[asteroid]]s that orbit the parent star.&lt;ref name="greaveswyatt03" /&gt; For example, the dust disk around the star [[tau Ceti]] indicates that that star has a population of objects analogous to our own Solar System's [[Kuiper Belt]], but at least ten times thicker.&lt;ref name="greaveswyatt04" /&gt;

More speculatively, features in dust disks sometimes suggest the presence of full-sized planets. Some disks have a central cavity, meaning that they are really ring-shaped. The central cavity may be caused by a planet "clearing out" the dust inside its orbit. Other disks contain clumps that may be caused by the gravitational influence of a planet. Both these kinds of features are present in the dust disk around [[epsilon Eridani]], hinting at the presence of a planet with an orbital radius of around 40 [[Astronomical unit|AU]] (in addition to the inner planet detected through the radial-velocity method).&lt;ref name="greavesepseri05"&gt;{{cite journal |

=== Contamination of stellar atmospheres ===
Spectral analysis of [[white dwarf]]s' [[stellar atmosphere|atmospheres]] often finds contamination of heavier elements like [[magnesium]] and [[calcium]]. These elements cannot originate from the stars' core, and it is probable that the contamination comes from [[asteroid]]s that got too close (within the [[Roche limit]]) to these stars by gravitational interaction with larger planets and were torn apart by star's tidal forces. Up to 50% of young white dwarfs may be contaminated in this manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Koester|first=D.|last2=Gänsicke|first2=B. T.|last3=Farihi|first3=J.|date=2014-06-01|title=The frequency of planetary debris around young white dwarfs|url=http://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/abs/2014/06/aa23691-14/aa23691-14.html|journal=Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics|language=en|volume=566|pages=A34|doi=10.1051/0004-6361/201423691|issn=0004-6361|bibcode=2014A&amp;A...566A..34K|arxiv = 1404.2617 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, the dust responsible for the atmospheric pollution may be detected by infrared radiation if it exists in sufficient quantity, similar to the detection of debris discs around main sequence stars. Data from the [[Spitzer Space Telescope]] suggests that 1-3% of white dwarfs possess detectable circumstellar dust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/090420-mm-solar-system.html|title=Dead Stars Once Hosted Solar Systems |last=Thompson|first=Andrea|date=20 April 2009|publisher=SPACE.com|accessdate=2009-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, minor planets were discovered transiting the white dwarf [[WD 1145+017]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vanderburg|first=Andrew|last2=Johnson|first2=John Asher|last3=Rappaport|first3=Saul|last4=Bieryla|first4=Allyson|last5=Irwin|first5=Jonathan|last6=Lewis|first6=John Arban|last7=Kipping|first7=David|last8=Brown|first8=Warren R.|last9=Dufour|first9=Patrick|date=2015-10-22|title=A disintegrating minor planet transiting a white dwarf|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v526/n7574/full/nature15527.html|journal=Nature|language=en|volume=526|issue=7574|pages=546–549|doi=10.1038/nature15527|pmid=26490620|issn=0028-0836|bibcode=2015Natur.526..546V|arxiv = 1510.06387 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This material orbits with a period of around 4.5 hours, and the shapes of the transit light curves suggest that the larger bodies are disintegrating, contributing to the contamination in the white dwarf's atmosphere.

== Space telescopes ==
Most confirmed extrasolar planets have been found using space-based telescopes (as of 01/2015).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/index.html|title=NASA Exoplanet Archive|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the detection methods can work more effectively with space-based telescopes that avoid atmospheric haze and turbulence.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2841">'''The Museum of Optical Technologies''' functions as part of the [[ITMO University|St. Petersburg State University of Information Technologies, Mechanics and Optics (SPbSU ITMO)]]. It was founded to acquaint young people with the achievements in optical technology, including both modern [[optical engineering]] and [[information technology]].

==Overview==

The museum is located at 14th Birzhevaya Line and was opened on December 16, 2003, at [[Vasilevsky Island]] as an open and interactive optics museum. It was formerly known as the Laboratories of the Russian State Optical Institute with support of the [[Saint Petersburg City Administration]].

During 2009-2010, it planned to open an interactive hall for employment of [[Schoolchildren]].

== Exhibitions ==

The [[trade fair|exposition]] is located on the ground floor of the building and consists of 3 halls.&lt;ref name="will acquaint"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.infopunkt.ru/news_topic.php?number=8198|trans-title=Interactive "the optics Museum" will acquaint with a life of holograms and astrolabes |script-title=ru:Интерактивный "Музей оптики" познакомит с жизнью голограмм и астролябий|date=2008-12-16|publisher=Piter Info site|language=Russian|accessdate=2009-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The first hall, there is a collection of art and computer holograms, real holographic installations, a statue of [[Yuri Nikolaevich Denisyuk]], and a training display - "a holography Basis" .
* The second hall, there is a large antique collection of [[bronze mirror]]s, old [[Light fixture|fixtures]], [[gnomon]] samples, [[astrolabe]]s, [[armillary sphere]]s, [[reading stone]]s, displays about the nature of light and the sight mechanism, a collection of spectral lamps and displays on photo stories.
* The third hall, there is a [[panorama]] of [[Venetian glass]], a collection of one hundred forty four [[Ernst Abbe|Abbe]] optical glasses, samples of the first experimental [[laser]] cores and fiber-optical elements with actual industrial equipment.

'''Opalite''' is a trade name for man-made [[Opalescence|opalescent]] [[glass]] and various opal simulants. Other names for this glass product include ''argenon'', ''sea opal'', ''opal moonstone'' and other similar names.&lt;ref name=Mindat/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eckert, Allan W. (1997). The World of Opals. New York, New York: John Wiley and Sons. pp. 107-108. {{ISBN|978-0-471-13397-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also used to promote impure varieties of variously colored common [[opal]].&lt;ref name=Mindat&gt;[http://www.mindat.org/min-5984.html Opalite on Mindat.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

Natural Opalite (as opposed to the man made Opalite) shares the same basic chemical properties as Opal. It is made of tiny spheres of Silicon Dioxide which stack onto each other in a pyramid grid shape. This grid is what allows the cat’s eye effect to be displayed when the stone is cut into a high domed cabochon. Natural opalite is referred to as "common opal" to prevent confusing it with glass opalite.

When opalite glass is placed against a dark background, it appears to have a blue color.  When placed against a light background, it is milky white with an orange or pink glow. Because it is glass, it may sometimes contain air bubbles, an after effect of the forming process.{{cn|date=September 2018}}

==Usages==

Opalite is mainly used as a decorative stone, and is usually sold either tumble polished or carved into decorative objects. Some sellers will sell opalite as [[opal]] or [[Moonstone (gemstone)|moonstone]].{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

'''Optimot, linguistic inquiries''', is a service provided by the Directorate - General of Linguistic Policy of the Catalan Government in collaboration with the [[Institut d'Estudis Catalans|Institute for Catalan Studies]] and the Terminology Center TERMCAT. It consists of a search engine for linguistic information that helps to clarify doubts about the Catalan language. With Optimot different sources can be checked at the same time in an integrated way. When the search options provided by Optimot do not manage to answer the linguistic question, a personalized inquiry service can be accessed.

== History ==
Up to 2007, the Consortium for Linguistic Normalization, the TERMCAT Terminology Centre, the Institute of Catalan Studies, and the directorate-general of Linguistics Politics dealt with linguistic inqueries that came from general population, companies, organizations, and language professionals. In order to avoid decentralization of the linguistic enquiries and to offer a unified service, Optimot was implemented. The search engine started working in October 2007 and the personalized service began in February 2008. Mainly, Optimot was to improve quality in linguistic-inquiry service by unifying criteria, and to promote linguistic autonomy.

== Search sources ==
The sources used in the searches performed by Optimot are the following:&lt;ref&gt;«[http://www20.gencat.cat/portal/site/Llengcat/menuitem.91021952ed2301e7a129d410b0c0e1a0/?vgnextoid=ee8e44ce74aa3110VgnVCM1000008d0c1e0aRCRD Optimot, consultes lingüístiques]».&amp;#x20;&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Perl Data Language''' (abbreviated '''PDL''') is a set of [[free software]] array programming extensions to the [[Perl|Perl programming language]]. PDL extends the data structures built into Perl, to include large [[Array data structure|multidimensional arrays]], and adds functionality to manipulate those arrays as vector objects. It also provides tools for [[image processing]], [[computer model]]ing of physical systems, and graphical plotting and presentation. Simple operations are automatically vectorized across complete arrays, and higher-dimensional operations (such as matrix multiplication) are supported.

==Language design==
PDL is a vectorized [[array programming]] language: the expression syntax is a variation on standard mathematical [[Vector (geometric)|vector]] notation, so that the user can combine and operate on large arrays with simple expressions. In this respect, PDL follows in the footsteps of the [[APL programming language]], and it has been compared to commercial languages such as [[MATLAB]] and [[Interactive Data Language]], and to other free languages such as [[NumPy]] and [[GNU Octave#Octave.2C the language|Octave]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blogs.perl.org/users/lhermida/2011/03/hi-everyone-as-a-bioinformatician.html|title=Putting Perl Back on Top in the Fields of Scientific and Financial Computing}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike MATLAB and IDL, PDL allows great flexibility in indexing and vectorization: for example, if a subroutine normally operates on a 2-D [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] array, passing it a 3-D [[data cube]] will generally cause the same operation to happen to each 2-D layer of the cube.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://pdl.perl.org/?docs=Threading&amp;title=PDL::Threading|title=PDL online documentation (PDL::Threading section)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PDL borrows from Perl at least three basic types of program structure: [[imperative programming]], [[functional programming]], and [[pipeline programming]] forms may be combined. Subroutines may be loaded either via a built-in [[autoload]] mechanism or via the usual Perl module mechanism. PDL-like functionality is being included in the development of [[Perl 6]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl6.language.data/2000/08/msg160.html|
title=Re: RFC 169 (v1) Proposed syntax for matrix element access and slicing.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Graphics==
[[Image:Pdl-plot.png|thumb|200px|right|A plot generated using PDL]]

True to the [[glue language]] roots of Perl, PDL borrows from several different modules for graphics and plotting support. [[NetPBM]] provides image file I/O (though FITS is supported natively). [[Gnuplot]], [[PLplot]], [[PGPLOT]], and [[Prima (graphics software)|Prima]] modules are supported for 2-D graphics and plotting applications, and [[Gnuplot]] and [[OpenGL]] are supported for 3-D plotting and rendering.

==I/O==
PDL provides facilities to read and write many open data formats, including [[JPEG]], [[Portable Network Graphics|PNG]], [[GIF]], [[portable pixmap|PPM]], [[MPEG]], [[FITS]], [[NetCDF]], [[GRIB]], raw binary files, and delimited ASCII tables. PDL programmers can use the [[CPAN]] Perl I/O libraries to read and write data in hundreds of standard and niche file formats.

==perldl==
An installation of PDL usually comes with an interactive [[Shell (computing)|shell]] known as '''perldl''', which can be used to perform simple calculations without requiring the user to create a Perl program file. A typical session of perldl would look something like the following:

&lt;source lang=perl&gt;
  perldl&gt; $x = pdl [[1, 2], [3, 4]];
 
  perldl&gt; $y = pdl [[5, 6, 7],[8, 9, 0]];
 
  perldl&gt; $z = $x x $y;
 
  perldl&gt; p $z;
 
  [
   [21 24  7]
   [47 54 21]
  ]
&lt;/source&gt;

The commands used in the shell are Perl statements that can be used in a program with &lt;code&gt;PDL&lt;/code&gt; module included. '''&lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;''' is an overloaded operator for matrix multiplication, and '''&lt;code&gt;p&lt;/code&gt;''' in the last command is a shortcut for '''&lt;code&gt;print&lt;/code&gt;'''.

==Implementation==
The core of PDL is written in [[C (programming language)|C]]. Most of the functionality is written in '''PP''', a PDL-specific metalanguage that handles the vectorization of simple C snippets and interfaces them with the Perl host language via Perl's [[XS (Perl)|XS]] compiler. Some modules are written in [[Fortran]], with a C/PP interface layer. Many of the supplied functions are written in PDL itself. PP is available to the user to write C-language extensions to PDL. There is also an Inline module (Inline::Pdlpp) that allows PP function definitions to be inserted directly into a Perl script; the relevant code is low-level compiled and made available as a Perl subroutine.

The PDL API uses the basic Perl 5 object-oriented functionality: PDL defines a new type of Perl scalar object ([[eponym]]ously called a "PDL", pronounced "piddle") that acts as a Perl scalar, but that contains a conventional [[data type|typed]] [[Array data type|array]] of numeric or character values. All of the standard Perl operators are overloaded so that they can be used on PDL objects transparently, and PDLs can be mixed-and-matched with normal Perl scalars. Several hundred object methods for operating on PDLs are supplied by the core modules.

==Perl 6 version==
In [[Perl 6]], PDL is specified as a trait in Synopsis 9.&lt;ref&gt;http://perlcabal.org/syn/S09.html#PDL_support&lt;/ref&gt; As of January 2013, this feature is not yet implemented in [[Rakudo Perl 6|Rakudo]], though.{{outdated section|date=March 2017}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21723">{{short description|Theorized phases of matter whose degrees of freedom include quarks and gluons}}
'''Quark matter''' or '''QCD matter''' refers to any of a number of theorized [[phase (matter)|phases]] of matter whose [[degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degrees of freedom]] include [[quark]]s and [[gluon]]s.{{clarify|date=October 2015|reason=Degrees of freedom is a number, such as 7 or 55, something immaterial; how can it include material particles?}} These theoretical phases would occur at extremely high temperatures and/or densities, billions of times higher than can be produced in equilibrium in laboratories. Under such extreme conditions, the familiar structure of matter, where the basic constituents are [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]] (consisting of [[nucleon]]s which are bound states of quarks) and electrons, is disrupted. In quark matter it is more appropriate to treat the quarks themselves as the basic degrees of freedom.

In the [[standard model]] of particle physics, the [[strong interaction|strong force]] is described by the theory of [[quantum chromodynamics]] (QCD). At ordinary temperatures or densities this force just [[color confinement|confines]] the quarks into composite particles ([[hadrons]]) of size around 10&lt;sup&gt;−15&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;m = 1&amp;nbsp;[[femtometer]] = 1&amp;nbsp;fm (corresponding to the QCD energy scale Λ&lt;sub&gt;QCD&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;≈&amp;nbsp;200&amp;nbsp;[[MeV]]) and its effects are not noticeable at longer distances. However, when the temperature reaches the QCD energy scale ([[Electronvolt|T]] of order 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;[[kelvin]]s) or the density rises to the point where the average inter-quark separation is less than 1 fm (quark [[chemical potential]] μ around 400&amp;nbsp;MeV), the hadrons are melted into their constituent quarks, and the strong interaction becomes the dominant feature of the physics. Such phases are called quark matter or QCD matter.

The strength of the color force makes the properties of quark matter unlike gas or plasma, instead leading to a state of matter more reminiscent of a liquid. At high densities, quark matter is a [[Fermi liquid theory|Fermi liquid]], but is predicted to exhibit [[color superconductivity]] at high densities and temperatures below 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; K.

{{unsolved|physics|QCD in the non-[[Perturbation theory (quantum mechanics)|perturbative]] regime: '''quark matter'''. The equations of QCD predict that a [[quark–gluon plasma|sea of quarks and gluons]] should be formed at high temperature and density. What are the properties of this [[phase of matter]]?}}

==Occurrence==

===Natural occurrence===

* According to the [[Big Bang]] theory, in the early universe at high temperatures when the universe was only a few tens of microseconds old, the phase of matter took the form of a hot phase of quark matter called the [[quark–gluon plasma]] (QGP).&lt;ref&gt;See ''"Hadrons and quark-gluon plasma"'' for example.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Compact star]]s ([[neutron star]]s). A neutron star is much cooler than 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; K, but it has been compressed by the supernova creating it to such high densities, that it is reasonable to surmise that quark matter may exist in the core.&lt;ref&gt;Shapiro and Teukolsky: ''Black Holes, White Dwarfs and Neutron Stars: The Physics of Compact Objects'', Wiley 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Compact stars composed mostly or entirely of quark matter are called [[quark star]]s or [[Quark star#Strange stars|strange star]]s, yet at this time no star with properties expected of these objects has been observed.
* [[Strangelet]]s. These are theoretically postulated (but as yet unobserved) lumps of [[strange matter]] comprising nearly equal amounts of up, down and strange quarks. Strangelets are supposed to be present in the [[galactic flux]] of high energy particles and should therefore theoretically be detectable in [[cosmic rays]] here on Earth, but no strangelet has been detected with certainty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://inspirehep.net/record/1483757/references |title=Proceedings: A production scenario of Galactic strangelets and an estimation of their possible flux in solar neighborhood |pages=504 |last=Biswas |first=Sayan |display-authors=etal |publisher=inSpire |year=2016 |accessdate=11 October 2016|doi=10.22323/1.236.0504 |chapter=A production scenario of Galactic strangelets and an estimation of their possible flux in solar neighborhood }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper|title=Strangelet propagation and cosmic ray flux|author=Madsen, Jes|date=18 November 2004|journal=Phys. Rev. D|volume=71|pages=014026|doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.71.014026|accessdate=11 October 2016|arxiv=astro-ph/0411538|bibcode=2005PhRvD..71a4026M}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Cosmic ray]] impacts. Cosmic rays comprise a lot of different particles, including highly accelerated atomic nuclei, particularly that of [[iron]]. Laboratory experiments suggests that the inevitable interaction with heavy [[noble gas]] nuclei in the [[upper atmosphere]] would lead to quark–gluon plasma formation.

===Laboratory experiments===
[[File:Alicelead3.jpg|thumb|Particle debris trajectories from one of the first lead-ion collisions with the LHC, as recorded by the [[ALICE: A Large Ion Collider Experiment|ALICE]] detector. The extremely brief appearance of quark matter in the point of collision is inferred from the statistics of the trajectories.]]
Even though quark-gluon plasma can only occur under quite extreme conditions of temperature and/or pressure, it is being actively studied at [[particle collider]]s, such as the Large Hadron Collider [[Large Hadron Collider|LHC]] at [[CERN]] and the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider [[Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider|RHIC]] at [[Brookhaven National Laboratory]]. In these collisions, the plasma only occurs for a very short time before it spontaneously disintegrates, because the extreme conditions during the collision process cannot be upheld. The plasma's physical characteristics are studied by detecting the debris emanating from the collision region with large particle detectors &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://home.cern/about/experiments/alice|title=ALICE |publisher=CERN |accessdate= 16 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See ''"Hunting the quark gluoan plasma"'' as an example of the research at RHIC.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Heavy-ion collisions]] at very high energies can produce small short-lived regions of space whose energy density is comparable to that of the [[Chronology of the universe#Quark epoch|20-micro-second-old universe]]. This has been achieved by colliding heavy nuclei such as [[lead]] nuclei at high speeds, and a first time claim of formation of [[QGP|quark–gluon plasma]] came from the [[Super Proton Synchrotron|SPS]] accelerator at [[CERN]] in February 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv|eprint=nucl-th/0002042|last1=Heinz|first1=Ulrich|title=Evidence for a New State of Matter: An Assessment of the Results from the CERN Lead Beam Programme|last2=Jacob|first2=Maurice|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; This work has been continued at more powerful accelerators, such as RHIC in the USA, and as of 2010 at the European LHC at CERN located in the border area of Switzerland and France. There is good evidence that the quark–gluon plasma has also been produced at RHIC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv|eprint=nucl-th/0508062|last1=Heinz|first1=Ulrich|title=Quark Matter 2005 – Theoretical Summary|last2=Jacob|first2=Maurice|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Thermodynamics==

The context for understanding the thermodynamics of quark matter is the [[standard model]] of particle physics, which contains six different [[flavor (particle physics)|flavors]] of quarks, as well as [[lepton]]s like [[electron]]s and [[neutrino]]s.  These interact via the [[strong interaction]], [[electromagnetism]], and also the [[weak interaction]] which allows one flavor of quark to turn into another. Electromagnetic interactions occur between particles that carry electrical charge; strong interactions occur between particles that carry [[color charge]].

The correct thermodynamic treatment of quark matter depends on the physical context. For large quantities that exist for long periods of time (the "thermodynamic limit"), we must take into account the fact that the only conserved charges in the standard model are quark number (equivalent to [[baryon]] number), electric charge, the eight color charges, and lepton number. Each of these can have an associated chemical potential.  However, large volumes of matter must be electrically and color-neutral, which determines the electric and color charge chemical potentials. This leaves a three-dimensional [[phase space]], parameterized by quark chemical potential, lepton chemical potential, and temperature.

In compact stars quark matter would occupy cubic kilometers and exist for millions of years, so the thermodynamic limit is appropriate. However, the neutrinos escape, violating lepton number, so the phase space for quark matter in compact stars only has two dimensions, temperature (''T'') and quark number chemical potential μ. A [[strangelet]] is not in the thermodynamic limit of large volume, so it is like an exotic nucleus: it may carry electric charge.

A heavy-ion collision is in neither the thermodynamic limit of large volumes nor long times. Putting aside questions of whether it is sufficiently equilibrated for thermodynamics to be applicable, there is certainly not enough time for weak interactions to occur, so flavor is conserved, and there are independent chemical potentials for all six quark flavors. The initial conditions (the [[impact parameter]] of the collision, the number of up and down quarks in the colliding nuclei, and the fact that they contain no quarks of other flavors) determine the chemical potentials. (Reference for this section:,&lt;ref name='RMP'/&gt;&lt;ref name='Rischke'/&gt;).

==Phase diagram==

The phase diagram of quark matter is not well known, either experimentally or theoretically. A commonly conjectured form of the
phase diagram is shown in the figure.&lt;ref name='RMP'&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Alford, Mark G.|author2=Schmitt, Andreas|author3=Rajagopal, Krishna|author4=Schäfer, Thomas|title=Color superconductivity in dense quark matter|arxiv=0709.4635 |journal=Reviews of Modern Physics |volume=80|issue=4 |pages=1455–1515 |year=2008|doi=10.1103/RevModPhys.80.1455|bibcode=2008RvMP...80.1455A}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is applicable to matter in a compact star, where the only relevant thermodynamic potentials are quark [[chemical potential#Fundamental particle chemical potential|chemical potential]] μ and [[temperature]] T. For guidance it also shows the typical values of μ and ''T'' in heavy-ion collisions and in the early universe. For readers who are not familiar with the concept of a chemical potential, it is helpful to think of μ as a measure of the imbalance between quarks and antiquarks in the system. Higher μ means a stronger bias favoring quarks over antiquarks. At low temperatures there are no antiquarks, and then higher μ generally means a higher density of quarks.

Ordinary atomic matter as we know it is really a mixed phase, droplets of nuclear matter (nuclei) surrounded by vacuum, which exists at the low-temperature phase boundary between vacuum and nuclear matter, at μ&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;310&amp;nbsp;MeV and ''T'' close to zero. If we increase the quark density (i.e. increase μ) keeping the temperature low, we move into a phase of more and more compressed nuclear matter. Following this path corresponds to burrowing more and more deeply into a [[neutron star]]. Eventually, at an unknown critical value of μ, there is a transition to quark matter. At ultra-high densities we expect to find the [[Color-flavor locking|color-flavor-locked]] (CFL) phase of [[color superconductivity|color-superconducting]] quark matter. At intermediate densities we expect some other phases (labelled "non-CFL quark liquid" in the figure) whose nature is presently unknown,.&lt;ref name='RMP'/&gt;&lt;ref name='Rischke'/&gt; They might be other forms of color-superconducting quark matter, or something different.

Now, imagine starting at the bottom left corner of the phase diagram, in the vacuum where μ&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''T''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0. If we heat up the system without introducing any preference for quarks over antiquarks, this corresponds to moving vertically upwards along the ''T'' axis. At first, quarks are still confined and we create a gas of hadrons ([[pion]]s, mostly). Then around ''T''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;150&amp;nbsp;MeV there is a crossover to the quark gluon plasma: thermal fluctuations break up the pions, and we find a gas of quarks, antiquarks, and gluons, as well as lighter particles such as photons, electrons, positrons, etc. Following this path corresponds to travelling far back in time (so to say), to the state of the universe shortly after the big bang (where there was a very tiny preference for quarks over antiquarks).

The line that rises up from the nuclear/quark matter transition and then bends back towards the ''T'' axis, with its end marked by a star, is the conjectured boundary between confined and unconfined phases. Until recently it was also believed to be a boundary between phases where chiral symmetry is broken (low temperature and density) and phases where it is unbroken (high temperature and density). It is now known that the CFL phase exhibits chiral symmetry breaking, and other quark matter phases may also break chiral symmetry, so it is not clear whether this is really a chiral transition line. The line ends at the "chiral [[critical point (thermodynamics)|critical point]]", marked by a star in this figure, which is a special temperature and density at which striking physical phenomena, analogous to [[critical opalescence]], are expected. (Reference for this section:,&lt;ref name='RMP'/&gt;&lt;ref name='Rischke'/&gt;&lt;ref name='TS'/&gt;).

For a complete description of phase diagram it is required that one must have complete understanding of dense, strongly interacting hadronic matter and strongly interacting quark matter from some underlying theory e.g. quantum chromodynamics (QCD). However, because such a description requires the proper understanding of QCD in its non-perturbative regime, which is still far from being completely understood, any theoretical advance remains very challenging.

==Theoretical challenges: calculation techniques==

The phase structure of quark matter remains mostly conjectural because it is difficult to perform calculations predicting the properties of quark matter. The reason is that QCD, the theory describing the dominant interaction between quarks, is strongly coupled at the densities and temperatures of greatest physical interest, and hence it is very hard to obtain any predictions from it. Here are brief descriptions of some of the standard approaches.

===Lattice gauge theory===
The only first-principles calculational tool currently available is [[lattice QCD]], i.e. brute-force computer calculations. Because of a technical obstacle known as the fermion [[sign problem]], this method can only be used at low density and high temperature (μ&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''T''), and it predicts that the crossover to the quark–gluon plasma will occur around ''T''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;150&amp;nbsp;MeV &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=P. Petreczky | title= Lattice QCD at non-zero temperature| journal=J. Phys. G | volume=39  | date=2012 | pages= 093002 | doi=10.1088/0954-3899/39/9/093002 | arxiv=1203.5320 | issue=9 |bibcode = 2012JPhG...39i3002P }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it cannot be used to investigate the interesting color-superconducting phase structure at high density and low temperature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Christian Schmidt |journal=PoS LAT2006 |volume=2006 |issue=21 |page=021 |title=Lattice QCD at Finite Density |year=2006 |arxiv=hep-lat/0610116|bibcode = 2006slft.confE..21S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Weak coupling theory===

Because QCD is [[asymptotic freedom|asymptotically free]] it becomes weakly coupled at unrealistically high densities, and diagrammatic
methods can be used.&lt;ref name='Rischke'&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.ppnp.2003.09.002 |last1=Rischke |first1=D |title=The quark–gluon plasma in equilibrium |journal=Progress in Particle and Nuclear Physics |volume=52 |issue=1 |pages=197–296 |year=2004|arxiv = nucl-th/0305030 |bibcode = 2004PrPNP..52..197R |citeseerx=10.1.1.265.4175 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such methods show that the CFL phase occurs at very high density. At high temperatures, however, diagrammatic methods are still not under full control.

===Models===

To obtain a rough idea of what phases might occur, one can use a model that has some of the same properties as QCD, but is easier to manipulate. Many physicists use [[Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model]]s, which contain no gluons, and replace the strong interaction with a [[four-fermion interaction]]. Mean-field methods are commonly used to analyse the phases. Another approach is the [[bag model]], in which the effects of confinement are simulated by an additive energy density that penalizes unconfined quark matter.

===Effective theories===

Many physicists simply give up on a microscopic approach, and make informed guesses of the expected phases (perhaps based on NJL model results). For each phase, they then write down an effective theory for the low-energy excitations, in terms of a small number of parameters, and use it to make predictions that could allow those parameters to be fixed by experimental observations.&lt;ref name='TS'&gt;

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other approaches===
{{main|AdS/QCD}}
There are other methods that are sometimes used to shed light on QCD, but for various reasons have not yet yielded useful results in studying quark matter.

====1/N expansion====
Treat the number of colors ''N'', which is actually 3, as a large number, and expand in powers of 1/''N''. It turns out that at high density the higher-order corrections are large, and the expansion gives misleading results.&lt;ref name='RMP'/&gt;

====Supersymmetry====
Adding scalar quarks (squarks) and fermionic gluons (gluinos) to the theory makes it more tractable, but the thermodynamics of quark matter depends crucially on the fact that only fermions can carry quark number, and on the number of degrees of freedom in general.

==Experimental challenges==

Experimentally, it is hard to map the phase diagram of quark matter because it has been rather difficult to learn how to tune to high enough temperatures and density in the laboratory experiment using collisions of relativistic heavy ions as experimental tools. However, these collisions ultimately will provide information about the crossover from [[Hadron|hadronic matter]] to QGP. It has been suggested that  the observations of compact stars may also constrain the information about the high-density low-temperature region. Models  of the cooling, spin-down, and precession of these stars offer information about the relevant properties of their interior. As observations become more precise, physicists hope to learn more.&lt;ref name='RMP'/&gt;

One of the natural subjects for future research is the search for the exact location of the chiral critical point. Some ambitious lattice QCD calculations may have found evidence for it, and future calculations will clarify the situation. Heavy-ion collisions might be able to measure its position experimentally, but this will require scanning across a range of values of μ and T.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0375-9474(99)85017-9|last1=Rajagopal|first1=K|title=Mapping the QCD phase diagram|arxiv=hep-ph/9908360 |journal=[[Nuclear Physics A]] |volume=661 |issue=1–4|date=1999 |pages=150–161|bibcode = 1999NuPhA.661..150R }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Radio Research Project''' was a [[social research]] project funded by the [[Rockefeller Foundation]] to look into the effects of mass media on society.&lt;ref&gt;La musa venal. Producción y consumo de la cultura industrial&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1937, the Rockefeller Foundation started funding research to find the effects of new forms of mass media on society, especially radio.  Several universities joined up and a headquarters was formed at the [[Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs|School of Public and International Affairs]] at [[Princeton University]].  

:A particularly influential program of effects research was pursued in the Office of Radio Research (ORR) established by the Rockefeller Foundation under the auspices of Princeton University. Managed by [[Paul Lazarsfeld]], Austrian émigré psychologist, the program was overseen by [[Hadley Cantril]], Princeton psychologist, and [[Frank Stanton (executive)|Frank Stanton]], director of research at CBS. The program was designed by Cantril and Stanton to determine why  people listened to radio. Stanton, a psychological researcher who soon became CBS president, was naturally interested in what lured people to programs and to what extent a program and its [[ad]]s boosted sales of products.&lt;ref&gt;J. Michael Sproule (1997) ''Propaganda and Democracy'', page 64, [[Cambridge University Press]] {{ISBN|0-521-47022-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the subjects of the Project's first studies were [[soap opera]]s, known as [[radio drama]]s at the time.

The Radio Project also conducted research on the infamous [[Halloween]] broadcast of ''[[The War of the Worlds (radio)|The War of the Worlds]]'' in 1938. Of the estimated 6 million people who heard this broadcast, they found that 25% accepted the program's reports of mass destruction. The majority of these did not think they were hearing a literal invasion from Mars, but rather an attack by Germany. The researchers determined that radio broadcasts from the [[Munich Crisis]] may have lent credence to this supposition.

A third research project was that of listening habits. Because of this, a new method was developed to survey an audience – this was dubbed the [[Little Annie Project]]. The official name was the [[Stanton-Lazarsfeld Program Analyzer]]. This allowed one not only to find out if a listener liked the performance, but how they felt at any individual moment, through a dial which they would turn to express their preference (positive or negative). This has since become an essential tool in focus group research.

[[Theodor Adorno]] produced numerous reports on the effects of "atomized listening" which radio supported and of which he was highly critical. However, because of profound methodological disagreements with Lazarsfeld over the use of techniques such as listener surveys and "Little Annie" (Adorno thought both grossly simplified and ignored the degree to which expressed tastes were the result of commercial marketing), Adorno left the project in 1941.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6837">The '''Raunkiær system''' is a system for categorizing plants using [[plant life-form|life-form]] categories, devised by [[Danes|Danish]] [[botany|botanist]] [[Christen C. Raunkiær]] and later extended by various authors.

[[File:Life_forms.png|thumb|upright=2|Life forms]]

== History ==
It was first proposed in a talk to the ''Danish Botanical Society'' in 1904 as can be inferred from the printed discussion of that talk, but not the talk itself, nor its title. The journal, [[Botanisk Tidsskrift]], published brief comments on the talk by M.P. Porsild, with replies by Raunkiær. A fuller account appeared in [[French language|French]] the following year.&lt;ref&gt;Raunkiær, C. (1905) Types biologiques pour la géographie botanique. ''Oversigt over Det [[Kongelige Danske Videnskabernes Selskab]]s Forhandlinger'', 1905, 347-438.&lt;/ref&gt; Raunkiær elaborated further on the system and published this in [[Danish language|Danish]] in 1907.&lt;ref&gt;Raunkiær, C. (1907) ''Planterigets Livsformer og deres Betydning for Geografien''. Gyldendalske Boghandel - Nordisk Forlag, København and Kristiania. 132 pp., [https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5657eb54e4b022a250fc2de4/t/566f9d430e4c117c7c652b3c/1450155331534/1907_Raunkier_Planterigets+Livsformer.pdf (PDF)].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="R34 Ch2"&gt;Ch. 2 in Raunkiær (1934): The life-forms of plants and their bearings on geography, p. 2-104.&lt;/ref&gt;

The original note and the 1907 paper were much later translated to [[English language|English]] and published with Raunkiær's collected works.&lt;ref name="R34 Ch1"&gt;Ch. 1 in Raunkiær (1934): Biological types with reference to the adaption of plants to survive the unfavourable season, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="R34 Ch2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Raunkiær, C. (1934) ''The Life Forms of Plants and Statistical Plant Geography, being the collected papers of C. Raunkiær''. Translated by H. Gilbert-Carter, A. Fausbøll, and A. G. Tansley. Oxford University Press, Oxford. Reprinted 1978 (ed. by Frank N. Egerton), Ayer Co Pub., in the "History of Ecology Series". {{ISBN|0-405-10418-9}}. Note: These are not all of Raunkiær's publications, only those on plant form and geography.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modernization ==
Raunkiær's life-form scheme has subsequently been revised and modified by various authors,&lt;ref&gt;Ellenberg. H. &amp; D. Mueller-Dombois (1967). A key to Raunkiær plant life-forms with revised subdivisions. ''Ber. Goebot. Inst. ETH. Stiftg Rubel. Zurich.'' 37:56-73, [http://www.e-periodica.ch/cntmng?pid=bgi-002:1965-1966:37::130].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Müller-Dombois, D. &amp; [[Heinz Ellenberg|H. Ellenberg]] (1974) ''Aims and methods in vegetation ecology''. John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York. Reprint 2003, Blackburn Press, {{ISBN|1-930665-73-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shimwell, D.W. (1971) ''The Description and Classification of Vegetation''. Sidgwick &amp; Jackson, London. {{ISBN|9780283980633}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the main structure has survived. Raunkiær's life-form system may be useful in researching the transformations of [[biota (ecology)|biota]]s and the genesis of some groups of phytophagous animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Volovnik |first=S.V. |title=On phylogenetic inertia: a case of Lixinae weevils |journal=Annales de la Société Entomologique de France (N.S.):International Journal of Entomology |date=2013 |volume=49 |issue=3 |pp=240–241}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subdivisions==
The subdivisions of the Raunkiær system are based on the place of the plant's growth-point ([[bud]]) during seasons with adverse conditions (cold seasons and dry seasons):

===Phanerophytes===
Projecting stems into the air – normally woody [[perennial]]s - with resting buds more than 25&amp;nbsp;cm above soil level,{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} e.g. [[tree]]s and [[shrub]]s, but also [[#Epiphytes|epiphytes]], which Raunkiær separated out as a special group in later versions of the system.

====Further subgrouping====
Raunkiær further subdivided the phanerophytes according to height as ''megaphanerophytes'', ''mesophanerophytes'', ''microphanerophytes'', and ''nanophanerophytes''. Other characters used to further subdivide were duration of leaves (evergreen or deciduous) and presence of covering [[bracts]] on buds (eight classes in all). Three further classes, phanerophytic [[succulent plant|stem succulents]], phanerophytic epiphytes, and phanerophytic herbs brought the number of subclasses to 12.

===Chamaephytes===
Buds on persistent shoots near the ground – woody plants with [[Glossary of botanical terms#P|perennating]] buds borne close to the ground, no more than 25&amp;nbsp;cm above the soil surface, (e.g., [[bilberry]] and [[Vinca|periwinkle]]).

===Hemicryptophytes===
[[image:Jmm-eye level dandelions.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Hemicryptophytes]]
Buds at or near the soil surface, e.g. [[Common daisy|daisy]], [[dandelion]].
:; Protohemicryptophytes : only stem leaves
:; Partial rosette plants : both stem and basal rosette leaves
:; Rosette plants : only basal rosette leaves

===Cryptophytes===
[[image:Krokusse im Schnee.jpg|thumb|200px|A cryptophyte geophyte]]
Below ground or under water - with resting buds lying either beneath the surface of the ground as a [[rhizome]], [[bulb]], [[corm]], etc., or a resting bud submerged under water. Cryptophytes are divided into 3 groups:
:; Geophytes : Resting in dry ground, e.g. [[crocus]], [[tulip]]. May be further subdivided into rhizome, stem-tuber, root-tuber, bulb and root geophytes.
:; Helophytes : Resting in marshy ground, e.g. [[reedmace]], [[marsh-marigold]].
:; Hydrophytes : Resting by being submerged under water, e.g. [[Nymphaeaceae|water-lily]], [[frogbit]].

===Therophytes===
Annual plants which complete their life-cycle rapidly under favorable conditions and survive the unfavorable cold or dry season in the form of seed. Many desert plants are by necessity therophytes.

===Epiphytes===
[[Epiphyte]]s were originally placed in Phanerophytes (above) but then separated because of irrelevance of soil position.

===Aerophytes===
[[File:Tillandsia.png|thumb|''[[Tillandsia landbeckii]]'', an aerophyte]]
A later addition to the Raunkiær lifeform classification.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/pss/3237161 Galán de Mera, A., M. A. Hagen &amp; J. A. Vicente Orellana (1999) Aerophyte, a New Life Form in Raunkiær's Classification? ''Journal of Vegetation Science'' 10 (1): 65-68]&lt;/ref&gt; Plant that obtains moisture and nutrients from the air and rain; usually grows on other plants but not [[parasitic]] on them. These are [[perennial plant]]s whose roots [[atrophy]]; some can live on mobile sand dunes; like epiphytes and hemicryptophytes, their [[bud]]s are near the surface. This group includes some but not all ''[[Tillandsia]]'' species.

{{update|date=November 2010}}{{Redirects here|RQF|the Regulated Qualifications Framework in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland|Regulated Qualifications Framework}}

'''Research Quality Framework''' ('''RQF''') was a component of [[Backing Australia's Ability]], an initiative of the [[Australian Government]] to formulate a best practice framework for assessing [[research]] quality and the impact of research, and ensure that public funding was being invested in research which would deliver real benefits to the wider community.  RQF was to bring public funding of research in line with government policy for funding to be determined by outcomes achieved.

It was an assessment framework and a funding model, similar to the [[Research Assessment Exercise]] in the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[Performance Based Research Fund]] in [[New Zealand]].&lt;ref name="med_of_aus"&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.mja.com.au/public/issues/184_09_010506/she10099_fm.html | title = The Research Quality Framework and its implications for health and medical research: time to take stock? | author = Louise G Shewan and Andrew J S Coats | journal = The Medical Journal of Australia | year = 2006 | volume = 184 | issue = 9 | pages = 463–466 | pmid = 16646748 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 December 2007, the new Australian Government announced that it would not be proceeding with the RQF project, which was an initiative of the former Government,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.dest.gov.au/sectors/research_sector/policies_issues_reviews/key_issues/research_quality_framework/ | title = RQF website | accessdate = 11 November 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and began developing the [[Excellence in Research for Australia]] initiative.

==Assessment framework==
Focuses on quality and impact.

The '''quality''' of research includes its intrinsic merit and academic impact - that is recognition of the originality of research by peers and its impact on the development of the same or related disciple areas.

The broader '''impact''' is an assessment of value through use, i.e. the extent to which research is successfully applied - that is recognition by qualified end-users that quality research has been successfully applied.

===Ratings===
* Simple ratings scale
** Quality : 5 points
** Impact : 3 points
* Sensitive to discipline differences
* Informs funding at institutional level, with institutions distributing funds according to their own priorities
* The implementation will be assessing the five-year period prior to its commencement, e.g. 2001-2006.

===Assessors===
* Decided on the recommendation of the EAG

===Oversight Committee===
* Chairs of assessment panels and other significant Australian and international experts
* Sets eligibility, assessment and assessor guidelines as well as guidelines relating to early career research and other emerging areas of research priority
* Approves moderation (across panels) and validation (or measures) mechanisms

==Funding model==
Will replace the RTS block funding model, and will be at least 50% of the determinations of funding.  Nelson says : all of the [[Institutional Grants Scheme]] (IGS) and at least 50% of the [[Research Training Scheme]] (RTS).

==Committees==

'''The Scottish Informatics and Computer Science Alliance''' ('''SICSA''') is a "research pool" funded by the [[Scottish Funding Council]]. A research pool is a collaboration of Scottish university departments whose broad objective is to create a coherent research community that will improve the quality of research carried out in Scotland in the pool-related discipline.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfc.ac.uk/research/researchpools/researchpools.aspx Research Pools] Scottish Funding Council, Edinburgh, Scotland. 3 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=26&amp;storycode=402333 A collective ambition that builds up to a critical mass]. Times Higher Education, 12 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

SICSA's goals are to improve the quality of research in informatics and computer science across universities in Scotland, to promote the transfer of research results to benefit companies and the public sector in Scotland and to create a university community that represents all aspects of Scottish Informatics and Computer Science.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencescotland.org/feature.php?id=119 The net worth of networks] Science Scotland 10, Royal Society of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, Scotland.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3726">'''Substrate reduction therapy''' offers an approach to treatment of certain [[metabolic disorder]]s, especially [[glycogen storage diseases]] and [[lysosomal storage disorders]]. In a storage disorder, a critical failure in a [[metabolic pathway]] prevents cellular breakdown and disposal of some large molecule. If residual breakdown through other pathways is insufficient to prevent harmful accumulation, the molecule accumulates in the cell and eventually interferes with normal biological processes. Examples of lysosomal storage disorders include [[Gaucher's disease]], [[Tay-Sachs disease]], and [[Sandhoff disease]].

In a metabolic or genetic pathway, enzymes catalyze a series of reactions. Each enzyme is regulated or mediated by one gene through its RNA and protein products. At each phase in the pathway, enzyme activity catalyzes a reaction in which a precursor molecule (the [[Substrate (biochemistry)|substrate]]) is transformed into its next intermediate state. Failure of the metabolic pathway leads to accumulation of the substrate, with possible harmful effects. Substrate reduction therapy addresses this failure by reducing the level of the substrate to a point where residual degradative activity is sufficient to prevent substrate accumulation.

== Examples ==

* '''[[Tay-Sachs disease]]'''. The disease occurs when harmful quantities of a [[fatty acid]] derivative called a [[ganglioside]] accumulate in the [[nerve cell]]s of the [[brain]]. Gangliosides are [[lipids]], components of cellular membranes, and the ganglioside GM2, implicated in Tay-Sachs disease, is especially common in the [[nervous tissue]] of the [[brain]]. By manipulating the brain's metabolism of GM2 gangliosides, an effective therapy could potentially be developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.276.5311.428 |publisher=American Academy for the Advancement of Sciences  |vauthors=Platt FM, Neises GR, Reinkensmeier G, etal | title=Prevention of lysosomal storage in Tay-Sachs mice treated with N-butyldeoxynojirimycin | pages=428–431 |date=1997 | volume= 276 | journal=Science |pmid=9103204 |issue=5311 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |publisher=Expert Opinion Investigational Drugs | pmid=11227045 | vauthors=Lachmann RH, Platt FM | title=Substrate reduction therapy for glycosphingolipid storage disorders | pages=455–66 |date=2001 | volume=10 | issue=3 | doi=10.1517/13543784.10.3.455 | journal=Expert Opinion on Investigational Drugs }}&lt;/ref&gt; One experiment has demonstrated that, by using the enzyme [[sialidase]], the genetic defect can be effectively bypassed and GM2 gangliosides can be metabolized so that they become almost inconsequential.

'''The Mind Museum''' is a [[science museum]] in [[Taguig]], [[Metro Manila]], [[Philippines]].  It is located on a {{convert|1.2|ha|acre}} lot in the J. Y. Campos Park in [[Bonifacio Global City]], a business district of the city.&lt;ref name="St.Michael2012"&gt;{{cite book|last=St.Michael|first=Rodney|title=Sync My World: The Middle Man &amp; the Middle Way SK SK|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ONxpAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA182|date=19 December 2012|publisher=Rodney St.Michael|isbn=978-1-300-40919-9|page=182}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The museum opened in March 16, 2012,&lt;ref name=openmind&gt;{{cite news|last1=Santiago|first1=Rodolfo|title=An open mind|url=http://www.rappler.com/life-and-style/3852-an-open-mind|accessdate=28 November 2015|publisher=Rappler|date=15 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; although a pre-launch reception was held a year earlier on December 15 where Vice President [[Jejomar Binay]] delivered a speech in behalf of President [[Benigno Aquino III]].&lt;ref name=gmanews&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lapeña|first1=Carmela|title=See, hear, feel and taste science at The Mind Museum|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/250363/lifestyle/travel/see-hear-feel-and-taste-science-at-the-mind-museum|accessdate=28 November 2015|publisher=GMA News|date=5 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The facility was developed by the Bonifacio Arts Foundation Inc (BAFI).&lt;ref name=openmind/&gt;

==Museum building==
The museum was designed by architect Ed Calma, from Lor Calma &amp; Partners. The design of the structure was inspired from [[Cell biology|cellular structure]] and [[Cellular growth|growth]] and had a solar reflective exterior, natural wind [[Ventilation (architecture)|ventilation]] and rainwater flow drainage.&lt;ref name=gmanews/&gt;

==Exhibits==
[[File:The Mind Museum, Bonifacio Global City.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Exhibits at the Mind Museum.]]
As of 2012, the museum has five main galleries occupying a {{convert|4900|sqm|sqft}} exhibit area and spanning 2 floors. The galleries each had its own theme namely, atom, life, earth, universe and technology which are linked by features called "Nature’s Webways". The atom, life, earth, univers galleries are located on the first floor while the technology gallery are found in the first floor of the two story museum.&lt;ref name=openmind/&gt;&lt;ref name=thea&gt;{{cite news|title=Thea Awards 2014 - THEA Award for Outstanding Achievement - Science Museum|url=http://www.teaconnect.org/Thea-Awards/Past-Awards/index.cfm?id=5378|accessdate=28 November 2015|publisher=Themed Entertainment Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With assistance from a firm based in the United States, which did the master plan of the museum, Filipino designers, scientists and fabricators did 90 percent of the museum's exhibits.&lt;ref name=thea/&gt; The designers included designers and faculty from the College of Fine Arts of the [[University of the Philippines]] and the [[University of Santo Tomas]].&lt;ref name=gmanews/&gt;

==Reception==
At the 2014 [[Themed Entertainment Association|THEA]] Awards held in April 5, at the [[Disneyland Resort]], [[Anaheim]], [[California]] in the [[United States]], the museum was awarded with the THEA Award for Outstanding Achievement for the Science Museum category for the design and execution of its exhibits.The distinction is the first for a Philippine establishment and for a science museum in Asia at the THEA Awards.&lt;ref name=thea/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Mind Museum bags int’l award for exhibit design and execution|url=http://lifestyle.inquirer.net/159174/the-mind-museum-bags-intl-award-for-exhibit-design-and-execution|accessdate=28 November 2015|publisher=INQUIRER.net|date=17 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25044">'''Transfection''' is the process of deliberately introducing naked or purified [[nucleic acids]] into [[Eukaryote|eukaryotic]] [[Cell (biology)|cells]].&lt;ref&gt;{{MeshName|Transfection}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=paguide_ch12&gt;{{cite web |title=Transfection |work=Protocols and Applications Guide |publisher=Promega |url=http://au.promega.com/resources/product-guides-and-selectors/protocols-and-applications-guide/transfection/}}&lt;/ref&gt; It may also refer to other methods and cell types, although other terms are often preferred: "[[transformation (genetics)|transformation]]" is typically used to describe non-viral [[DNA]] transfer in [[bacteria]] and non-animal [[eukaryote|eukaryotic]] cells, including plant cells. In animal cells, transfection is the preferred term as transformation is also used to refer to progression to a cancerous state ([[carcinogenesis]]) in these cells. [[Transduction (genetics)|Transduction]] is often used to describe virus-mediated gene transfer into eukaryotic cells.&lt;ref name=paguide_ch12 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{MeshName|Transduction, Genetic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''transfection'' is a [[portmanteau]] of ''trans-'' and ''infection''.  [[Genetics|Genetic]] material (such as [[DNA supercoil|supercoiled plasmid DNA]] or [[siRNA]] constructs), or even [[protein]]s such as [[antibodies]], may be transfected.

Transfection of [[animal cell]]s typically involves opening transient pores or "holes" in the [[plasma membrane|cell membrane]] to allow the uptake of material. Transfection can be carried out using [[calcium phosphate]] (i.e. [[tricalcium phosphate]]), by [[electroporation]], by cell squeezing or by mixing a [[cationic]] [[lipid]] with the material to produce [[liposomes]] that fuse with the cell membrane and deposit their cargo inside.

Transfection can result in unexpected morphologies and abnormalities in target cells.

==Terminology==
The meaning of the term has evolved.&lt;ref&gt;{{DorlandsDict|eight/000110186|Transfection}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The original meaning of transfection was "infection by transformation", i.e., introduction of genetic material, DNA or RNA, from a [[prokaryote]]-infecting virus or [[bacteriophage]] into cells, resulting in an infection.  Because the term transformation had another sense in animal cell biology (a genetic change allowing long-term propagation in culture, or acquisition of properties typical of cancer cells), the term transfection acquired, for animal cells, its present meaning of a change in cell properties caused by introduction of DNA.

==Methods==
There are various methods of introducing foreign [[DNA]] into a eukaryotic [[cell (biology)|cell]]: some rely on physical treatment (electroporation, cell squeezing, nanoparticles, magnetofection); others rely on chemical materials or biological particles (viruses) that are used as carriers. Gene delivery is, for example, one of the steps necessary for [[gene therapy]] and the genetic modification of crops. There are many different methods of gene delivery developed for various types of cells and tissues, from bacterial to mammalian. Generally, the methods can be divided into two categories: non-viral and viral.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kamimura K, Suda T, Zhang G, Liu D | title = Advances in Gene Delivery Systems | journal = Pharmaceutical Medicine | volume = 25 | issue = 5 | pages = 293–306 | date = October 2011 | pmid = 22200988 | doi = 10.2165/11594020-000000000-00000 | url = http://adisonline.com/pharmaceuticalmedicine/Abstract/2011/25050/Advances_in_Gene_Delivery_Systems.2.aspx | pmc=3245684}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Non-viral methods include physical methods such as [[electroporation]], [[microinjection]], [[gene gun]], [[impalefection]], [[hydrostatic pressure]], continuous infusion, and sonication and chemical, such as [[lipofection]], which is a lipid-mediated DNA-transfection process utilizing liposome vectors.  It can also include the use of polymeric gene carriers (polyplexes).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Saul JM, Linnes MP, Ratner BD, Giachelli CM, Pun SH | title = Delivery of non-viral gene carriers from sphere-templated fibrin scaffolds for sustained transgene expression | journal = Biomaterials | volume = 28 | issue = 31 | pages = 4705–16 | date = November 2007 | pmid = 17675152 | doi = 10.1016/j.biomaterials.2007.07.026 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Virus]] mediated gene delivery utilizes the ability of a virus to inject its DNA inside a host cell. A gene that is intended for delivery is packaged into a replication-deficient viral particle. Viruses used to date include [[retrovirus]], [[lentivirus]], [[adenovirus]], [[adeno-associated virus]] and [[herpes simplex virus]]. However, there are drawbacks to using viruses to deliver genes into cells. Viruses can only deliver very small pieces of DNA into the cells, it is labor-intensive and there are risks of random insertion sites, [[Cytopathic effect|cytopathic effects]] and mutagenesis.

===Nonviral methods===

====Chemical-based transfection====
'''Chemical-based transfection''' can be divided into several kinds: [[cyclodextrin]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Menuel S, Fontanay S, Clarot I, Duval RE, Diez L, Marsura A | title = Synthesis and complexation ability of a novel bis- (guanidinium)-tetrakis-(beta-cyclodextrin) dendrimeric tetrapod as a potential gene delivery (DNA and siRNA) system. Study of cellular siRNA transfection | journal = Bioconjugate Chemistry | volume = 19 | issue = 12 | pages = 2357–62 | date = December 2008 | pmid = 19053312 | doi = 10.1021/bc800193p }}&lt;/ref&gt; polymers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fischer D, von Harpe A, Kunath K, Petersen H, Li Y, Kissel T | title = Copolymers of ethylene imine and N-(2-hydroxyethyl)-ethylene imine as tools to study effects of polymer structure on physicochemical and biological properties of DNA complexes | journal = Bioconjugate Chemistry | volume = 13 | issue = 5 | pages = 1124–33 | year = 2002 | pmid = 12236795 | doi = 10.1021/bc025550w }}&lt;/ref&gt; liposomes, or nanoparticles&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Nanoparticle Based Transfection Reagents |work=Biology Transfection Research Resource |publisher=Transfection.ws |url=http://www.transfection.ws/nanoparticle_based_transfection_reagents}}&lt;/ref&gt; (with or without chemical or viral functionalization. See below).

*One of the cheapest methods uses '''calcium phosphate''', originally discovered by F. L. Graham and  A. J. van der Eb in 1973&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Graham FL, van der Eb AJ | title = A new technique for the assay of infectivity of human adenovirus 5 DNA | journal = Virology | volume = 52 | issue = 2 | pages = 456–67 | date = April 1973 | pmid = 4705382 | doi = 10.1016/0042-6822(73)90341-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (see also&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bacchetti S, Graham FL | title = Transfer of the gene for thymidine kinase to thymidine kinase-deficient human cells by purified herpes simplex viral DNA | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 74 | issue = 4 | pages = 1590–4 | date = April 1977 | pmid = 193108 | pmc = 430836 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.74.4.1590 | bibcode = 1977PNAS...74.1590B }}&lt;/ref&gt;). [[HEPES]]-buffered saline solution (HeBS) containing phosphate ions is combined with a [[calcium chloride]] solution containing the DNA to be transfected. When the two are combined, a fine precipitate of the positively charged calcium and the negatively charged phosphate will form, binding the DNA to be transfected on its surface. The suspension of the precipitate is then added to the cells to be transfected (usually a cell culture grown in a monolayer). By a process not entirely understood, the cells take up some of the precipitate, and with it, the DNA. This process has been a preferred method of identifying many oncogenes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Kriegler | first = Michael | name-list-format = vanc | title = Transfer and Expression: A Laboratory Manual | year = 1991 | publisher = W. H. Freeman | isbn = 978-0-7167-7004-6 | pages = 96–97 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Other methods use '''highly branched organic compounds''', so-called [[dendrimers]], to bind the DNA and get it into the cell.
*Another method is the use of '''cationic polymers''' such as [[DEAE|DEAE-dextran]] or [[polyethylenimine]] (PEI). The negatively charged DNA binds to the [[polycation]] and the complex is taken up by the cell via [[endocytosis]].
* '''Lipofection''' (or [[liposome]] transfection) is a technique used to inject genetic material into a cell by means of [[liposome]]s, which are [[vesicle (biology)|vesicles]] that can easily merge with the [[cell membrane]] since they are both made of a [[phospholipid bilayer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Felgner PL, Gadek TR, Holm M, Roman R, Chan HW, Wenz M, Northrop JP, Ringold GM, Danielsen M | title = Lipofection: a highly efficient, lipid-mediated DNA-transfection procedure | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 84 | issue = 21 | pages = 7413–7 | date = November 1987 | pmid = 2823261 | pmc = 299306 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.84.21.7413 | bibcode = 1987PNAS...84.7413F }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lipofection generally uses a positively charged ([[ion|cationic]]) lipid ([[cationic liposome]]s or mixtures) to form an aggregate with the negatively charged ([[ion|anionic]]) genetic material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Felgner JH, Kumar R, Sridhar CN, Wheeler CJ, Tsai YJ, Border R, Ramsey P, Martin M, Felgner PL | title = Enhanced gene delivery and mechanism studies with a novel series of cationic lipid formulations | journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 269 | issue = 4 | pages = 2550–61 | date = January 1994 | pmid = 8300583 | url = http://www.jbc.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=8300583 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This transfection technology performs the same tasks as other biochemical procedures utilizing polymers, [[Diethylaminoethyl cellulose|DEAE-dextran]], [[calcium phosphate]], and [[electroporation]]. The efficiency of lipofection can be improved by treating transfected cells with a mild [[heat shock]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pipes BL, Vasanwala FH, Tsang TC, Zhang T, Luo P, Harris DT | title = Brief heat shock increases stable integration of lipid-mediated DNA transfections | journal = BioTechniques | volume = 38 | issue = 1 | pages = 48, 50, 52 | date = January 2005 | pmid = 15679084 | url = http://www.biotechniques.com/BiotechniquesJournal/2005/January/Brief-heat-shock-increases-stable-integration-of-lipid-mediated-DNA-transfections/biotechniques-45348.html | doi=10.2144/05381bm05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Non-chemical methods====
[[File:Gemini X2 generator.jpg|thumbnail|Electroporator with square wave and exponential decay waveforms for in vitro, in vivo, adherent cell and 96 well electroporation applications. Manufactured by BTX Harvard Apparatus, Holliston MA USA.]]
*[[Electroporation]] ([[gene electrotransfer]]) is a popular method, where transient increase in the permeability of cell membrane is achieved when the cells are exposed to short pulses of an intense electric field.
* [[CellSqueeze|Cell squeezing]] is a method invented in 2012 by Armon Sharei, [[Robert Langer]] and Klavs Jensen at MIT. It enables delivery of molecules into cells via cell membrane deformation. It is a high throughput vector-free microfluidic platform for intracellular delivery. It reduces the possibility of toxicity or off-target effects as it does not rely on exogenous materials or electrical fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sharei A, Zoldan J, Adamo A, Sim WY, Cho N, Jackson E, Mao S, Schneider S, Han MJ, Lytton-Jean A, Basto PA, Jhunjhunwala S, Lee J, Heller DA, Kang JW, Hartoularos GC, Kim KS, Anderson DG, Langer R, Jensen KF | title = A vector-free microfluidic platform for intracellular delivery | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 110 | issue = 6 | pages = 2082–7 | date = February 2013 | pmid = 23341631 | pmc = 3568376 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1218705110 | bibcode = 2013PNAS..110.2082S }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Sonoporation]] uses high-intensity ultrasound to induce pore formation in cell membranes. This pore formation is attributed mainly to the [[cavitation]] of gas bubbles interacting with nearby cell membranes since it is enhanced by the addition of ultrasound contrast agent, a source of cavitation nuclei.
*[[Optical transfection]] is a method where a tiny (~1&amp;nbsp;µm diameter) hole is transiently generated in the plasma membrane of a cell using a highly focused laser.  This technique was first described in 1984 by Tsukakoshi et al., who used a frequency tripled Nd:YAG to generate stable and transient transfection of normal rat kidney cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Tsukakoshi M, Kurata S, Nomiya Y, etal |title=A Novel Method of DNA Transfection by Laser Microbeam Cell Surgery |journal=Applied Physics B: Photophysics and Laser Chemistry |volume=35 |issue=3 |pages=135–140 |year=1984 |doi=10.1007/BF00697702 |bibcode=1984ApPhB..35..135T}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In this technique, one cell at a time is treated, making it particularly useful for single cell analysis.
*Protoplast fusion is a technique in which transformed bacterial cells are treated with lysozyme in order to remove the cell wall. Following this, fusogenic agents (e.g., Sendai virus, PEG, electroporation) are used in order to fuse the protoplast carrying the gene of interest with the target recipient cell. A major disadvantage of this method is that bacterial components are non-specifically introduced into the target cell as well.
* [[Impalefection]] is a method of introducing DNA bound to a surface of a nanofiber that is inserted into a cell.  This approach can also be implemented with arrays of nanofibers that are introduced into large numbers of cells and intact tissue.
* [[Hydrodynamic delivery]] is a method used in mice and rats, but to a lesser extent in larger animals, in which DNA most often in [[plasmids]] (including [[transposons]]) can be delivered to the liver using hydrodynamic injection that involves infusion of a relatively large volume in the blood in less than 10 seconds; nearly all of the DNA is expressed in the liver by this procedure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zhang G, Budker V, Wolff JA | title = High levels of foreign gene expression in hepatocytes after tail vein injections of naked plasmid DNA | journal = Human Gene Therapy | volume = 10 | issue = 10 | pages = 1735–7 | date = July 1999 | pmid = 10428218 | doi = 10.1089/10430349950017734 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zhang G, Vargo D, Budker V, Armstrong N, Knechtle S, Wolff JA | title = Expression of naked plasmid DNA injected into the afferent and efferent vessels of rodent and dog livers | journal = Human Gene Therapy | volume = 8 | issue = 15 | pages = 1763–72 | date = October 1997 | pmid = 9358026 | doi = 10.1089/hum.1997.8.15-1763 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bell JB, Podetz-Pedersen KM, Aronovich EL, Belur LR, McIvor RS, Hackett PB | title = Preferential delivery of the Sleeping Beauty transposon system to livers of mice by hydrodynamic injection | journal = Nature Protocols | volume = 2 | issue = 12 | pages = 3153–65 | year = 2007 | pmid = 18079715 | pmc = 2548418 | doi = 10.1038/nprot.2007.471 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Particle-based methods====
*A direct approach to transfection is the [[gene gun]], where the DNA is coupled to a [[nanoparticle]] of an [[Chemically inert|inert]] solid (commonly gold), which is then "shot" directly into the target cell's [[cell nucleus|nucleus]].
*[[Magnetofection]], or [[magnet-assisted transfection]], is a transfection method that uses magnetic force to deliver DNA into target cells.  Nucleic acids are first associated with magnetic nanoparticles. Then, application of magnetic force drives the nucleic acid particle complexes towards and into the target cells, where the cargo is released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Magnetofection — Magnetic assisted transfection &amp; transduction |publisher=OzBiosciences—The art of delivery systems|url=http://www.ozbiosciences.com/magnetofection.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Impalefection]] is carried out by impaling cells by elongated nanostructures and arrays of such nanostructures such as [[carbon nanofibers]] or [[silicon]] [[nanowires]] that have been functionalized with [[plasmid]] [[DNA]].
*Another particle-based method of transfection is known as particle bombardment. The nucleic acid is delivered through membrane penetration at a high velocity, usually connected to microprojectiles.&lt;ref name=paguide_ch12/&gt;

====Other (and hybrid) methods====
'''Other methods''' of transfection include [[nucleofection]], which has proved very efficient in transfection of the [[THP-1 cell line]], creating a viable cell line that was able to be differentiated into mature macrophages,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Schnoor M, Buers I, Sietmann A, Brodde MF, Hofnagel O, Robenek H, Lorkowski S | title = Efficient non-viral transfection of THP-1 cells | journal = Journal of Immunological Methods | volume = 344 | issue = 2 | pages = 109–15 | date = May 2009 | pmid = 19345690 | doi = 10.1016/j.jim.2009.03.014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[heat shock]].

===Viral methods===
DNA can also be introduced into cells using [[virus]]es as a carrier. In such cases, the technique is called [[transduction (genetics)|viral transduction]], and the cells are said to be transduced. [[Adeno-associated virus|Adenoviral]] vectors can be useful for viral transfection methods because they can transfer genes into a wide variety of human cells and have high transfer rates.&lt;ref name=paguide_ch12/&gt; Lentiviral vectors are also helpful due to their ability to transduce cells not currently undergoing mitosis.

==Stable and transient transfection==
Stable and transient transfection differ in their long term effects on a cell; a stably-transfected cell will continuously express transfected DNA and pass it on to [[Cell division|daughter cells]], while a transiently-transfected cell will express transfected DNA for a short amount of time and not pass it on to daughter cells.

For some applications of transfection, it is sufficient if the transfected genetic material is only transiently expressed. Since the DNA introduced in the transfection process is usually not integrated into the nuclear genome, the foreign DNA will be diluted through [[mitosis]] or degraded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kim TK, Eberwine JH | title = Mammalian cell transfection: the present and the future | journal = Analytical and Bioanalytical Chemistry | volume = 397 | issue = 8 | pages = 3173–8 | date = August 2010 | pmid = 20549496 | doi = 10.1007/s00216-010-3821-6 | pmc=2911531}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cell lines expressing the [[Epstein–Barr virus]] (EBV) nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA1) or the SV40 large-T antigen, allow episomal amplification of plasmids containing the viral EBV (293E) or SV40 (293T) origins of replication, greatly reducing the rate of dilution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Durocher Y, Perret S, Kamen A | title = High-level and high-throughput recombinant protein production by transient transfection of suspension-growing human 293-EBNA1 cells | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 30 | issue = 2 | pages = E9 | date = January 2002 | pmid = 11788735 | pmc = 99848 | doi = 10.1093/nar/30.2.e9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

If it is desired that the transfected gene actually remain in the genome of the cell and its daughter cells, a stable transfection must occur.  To accomplish this, a [[marker gene]] is co-transfected, which gives the cell some selectable advantage, such as resistance towards a certain [[toxin]]. Some (very few) of the transfected cells will, by chance, have integrated the foreign genetic material into their genome. If the toxin is then added to the cell culture, only those few cells with the marker gene integrated into their genomes will be able to [[cell proliferation|proliferate]], while other cells will die. After applying this selective stress (selection pressure) for some time, only the cells with a stable transfection remain and can be cultivated further.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Science of Stable Cell Line Generation|first1=Alex|last1=Fanelli | name-list-format = vanc | url = http://www.stablecellline.com/the-science-of-stable-cell-line-generation/|date=2016|access-date=23 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Common agents for selecting stable transfection are:

* [[Geneticin]], or G418,  neutralized by the product of the [[neomycin]] resistance gene
* [[Puromycin]]
* [[Zeocin]]
* [[Hygromycin B]]
* [[Blasticidin S]]

==RNA transfection==
{{Main|RNA transfection}}
RNA can also be transfected into cells to transiently express its coded protein, or to study [[MRNA#Degradation|RNA decay]] kinetics. RNA transfection is often used in primary cells that do not divide.

[[siRNA|siRNAs]] can also be transfected to achieve RNA silencing (i.e. loss of RNA and protein from the targeted gene). This has become a major application in research to achieve "[[Gene knockdown|knock-down]]" of proteins of interests (e.g. Endothelin-1&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mawji IA, Marsden PA | title = RNA transfection is a versatile tool to investigate endothelin-1 posttranscriptional regulation | journal = Experimental Biology and Medicine | volume = 231 | issue = 6 | pages = 704–8 | date = June 2006 | pmid = 16740984 | doi = 10.3181/00379727-231-2310704 | url = http://ebm.sagepub.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=16740984 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) with potential applications in gene therapy. Limitation of the silencing approach are the toxicity of the transfection for cells and potential "off-target" effects on the expression of other genes/proteins.

The '''Woozle effect''', also known as '''evidence by citation''',&lt;ref name="stras001"&gt;{{cite journal | title = Processes Explaining the Concealment and Distortion of Evidence on Gender Symmetry in Partner Violence | url = http://pubpages.unh.edu/~mas2/V74-proofs-07.pdf | journal = European Journal on Criminal Policy and Research | date = 14 July 2007 | first = Murray A. | last = Strauss | volume = 74 | issue = 13 | pages = 227–32 | doi = 10.1007/s10610-007-9060-5 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; or a '''woozle''', occurs when frequent citation of previous publications that lack evidence misleads individuals, groups, and the public into thinking or believing there is evidence, and nonfacts become [[urban myths]] and [[factoids]].&lt;ref name="GellesStraus1988"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Richard J. Gelles|author2=Murray Arnold Straus|title=Intimate violence|date=July 1988|publisher=Simon and Schuster|page=39|isbn=978-0-671-61752-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin and definition==
A Woozle is an imaginary character in the [[A. A. Milne]] book ''[[Winnie-the-Pooh (book)|Winnie-the-Pooh]]'', published in 1926. In chapter three, "In which Pooh and Piglet Go Hunting and Nearly Catch a Woozle", [[Winnie-the-Pooh]] and [[Piglet (Winnie-the-Pooh)|Piglet]] start following tracks left in snow believing they are the tracks of an imaginary animal called a ''[[List of Winnie-the-Pooh characters#Woozles|woozle]]''. The tracks keep multiplying until [[Christopher Robin]] explains to them that they have been following their own tracks in circles around a tree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1 = Milne |first1 = A. A. |title = Winnie The Pooh |chapter = 3 |edition = 1 |publisher = Methuen &amp; Co Ltd |year = 1926 |location = London |quote = "In Which Pooh and Piglet Go Hunting and Nearly Catch a Woozle"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the introduction of the specific term "Woozle effect", the underlying research phenomenon (and connection to the Woozle) dates back over 60 years. Bevan (1953), writing about scientific methodology and research errors in the field of psychology, uses the term "scientific woozle hunters".&lt;ref name="Bevan1953"&gt;{{cite book |author=William Bevan|title=Modern Psychologists: Scientific Woozle Hunters?: An Opinion in Outline |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iIN7-jP7yBQC|year=1953|publisher=E. Munksgaard}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wohlwill (1963) refers to a "hunt for the woozle" in social science research,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wohlwill |first1=Joachim F. |year=1963 |title=Piaget's system as a source of empirical research |journal=Merrill-Palmer Quarterly of Behavior and Development |volume=9 |issue=4 |pages=253–62 |jstor=23082932}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Stevens (1971) cautions readers about woozles in the study of a misquoted letter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Stevens |first1=Joan |year=1971 |title=Woozles in Brontëland: A cautionary tale |journal=Studies in Bibliography |volume=24 |issue= |pages=99–108 |jstor=40371529}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Richard J. Gelles]], the term "woozle effect" was coined by Beverly Houghton in 1979.&lt;ref name="Houghton001" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gelles, 1980" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Generalization and Containment: Different Effects of Past Aggression for Wives and Husbands|author1=Jean Malone|author2=Andrea Tyree |author3=K.

Straus]] (1988).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1= Dutton |first1= Donald D. |last2= Corvo |first2= Kenneth |title= Transforming a flawed policy: A call to revive psychology and science in domestic violence research and practice |journal= Aggression and Violent Behavior |volume= 11 |issue= 5 |year= 2006 |page= 466 |doi=10.1016/j.avb.2006.01.007|citeseerx= 10.1.1.337.1019 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last= Ehrensaft |first= Miriam K. |title= Intimate partner violence: Persistence of myths and implications for intervention |journal= Children and Youth Services Review |volume= 30 |issue= 3 |year= 2009 |pages= 279–86 |doi=10.1016/j.childyouth.2007.10.005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gelles and Straus argue that the woozle effect describes a pattern of bias seen within social sciences and which is identified as leading to multiple errors in individual and public perception, academia, policy making and government. A woozle is also a claim made about research which is not supported by original findings.&lt;ref name="GellesStraus1988woozlenoun"&gt;{{cite book| author1=Richard J. Gelles| author2=Murray Arnold Straus| title=Intimate Violence |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_pYoAAAAYAAJ| date=July 1988| publisher=Simon and Schuster| isbn=978-0-671-61752-3 |page=28| chapter=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Dutton, a woozle effect, or a woozle, occurs when frequent citation of previous publications that lack evidence misleads individuals, groups and the public into thinking or believing there is evidence, and non-facts become urban myths and factoids.&lt;ref name="GellesStraus1988"/&gt; The creation of woozles is often linked to the changing of language from qualified ("it may", "it might", "it could") to absolute form ("it is") firming up language and introducing ideas and views not held by an original author or supported by evidence.&lt;ref name="Dutton2006"&gt;{{cite book |author=Donald G.

Dutton sees the woozle effect as an example of [[confirmation bias]] and links it to [[belief perseverance]] and [[groupthink]].&lt;ref name="Dutton2006"/&gt;{{rp|page=109}} Because in the social sciences empirical evidence may be based on experiential reports rather than objective measurements, there may be a tendency for researchers to align evidence with expectation. According to Dutton it is also possible that the social sciences may be likely to align with contemporary views and ideals of social justice, leading to bias in favor of those ideals.&lt;ref name="Dutton2006" /&gt;{{rp|page=110}} Gambrill (2012) links the woozle effect to the processes that create [[pseudoscience]].&lt;ref name="Gambrill2012" &gt;{{cite book |author=Eileen Gambrill |title=Critical Thinking in Clinical Practice: Improving the Quality of Judgments and Decisions |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NsuHtwciwQwC&amp;pg=PA109|date=1 May 2012 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |isbn=978-0-470-90438-1 |page=109 |edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gambrill and Reiman (2011) also link it with more deliberate propaganda techniques; they also identify introductory phrases like "Every one knows ...", "It is clear that ...", "It is obvious that ...", "It is generally agreed that ..." as alarm bells that what follows might be a Woozle line of reasoning.&lt;ref name="pone2011" &gt;{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0019516

Others will then cite both reports and the qualified data gain the status of generalizable 'truth.'

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1998 book ''Intimate Violence'', Gelles and Straus use the Winnie-the-Pooh woozle to illustrate how poor practice in research and self-referential research causes older research to be taken as fresh evidence causing error and bias.&lt;ref name="GellesStraus1988"/&gt;

In a study conducted by the [[Vera Institute of Justice]], Weiner and Hala (2008) reported some of the research-related difficulties associated with measuring [[human trafficking]].&lt;ref name="Weiner &amp; Hala"&gt;{{cite report |last1=Weiner |first1=Neil A. |last2=Hala|first2=Nicole|year=2008 |title=Measuring human trafficking: Lessons from New York City|journal= |volume=|issue=|pages=|publisher=[[Vera Institute of Justice]] |url= https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/grants/224391.pdf |accessdate=5 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; They describe and map the unfolding of the Woozle effect in connection with [[prevalence]] estimates of human trafficking. Searching the relevant literature between 1990 and 2006, Weiner and Hala found 114 prevalence estimates in 45 publications. Only one of the publications cited [[Original research#Original research|original research]], and several prevalence estimates appeared unsourced.&lt;ref name="Weiner &amp; Hala"/&gt; The authors concluded that the sources they reviewed lacked citations, adequate [[operational definition]], and discussion of [[methodology]].&lt;ref name="Weiner &amp; Hala"/&gt; Stransky and [[David Finkelhor|Finkelhor]] (2008/2012) criticize the general methodology involved in human trafficking research. They cite the Woozle effect (p.&amp;nbsp;3) and post a prominent warning on the first page of their report cautioning against citing any specific estimates they present, as the close inspection of the figures "...reveals that none are based on a strong scientific foundation.

Gambrill and Reiman (2011) analyze scientific papers and mass-market communications about [[social anxiety]] and conclude that many of them engage in [[disease mongering]] by presenting the disease model of social anxiety as an incontrovertible fact by resorting to unchallenged repetition techniques and by leaving out of the discourse any competing theories. Gambrill and Reiman further note that even after educating their subjects about the tell-tale signs of such techniques, many of them still failed to pick up the signs in a practical test.&lt;ref name="pone2011"/&gt;

James J. Kimble gives as an example the 1994–2015 historiography of the 1943 American "[[We Can Do It!]]" wartime poster. After Michigan resident [[Geraldine Hoff Doyle]] said in 1994 that she was the real-life model for the poster, many sources repeated her assertion without checking the two foundational assumptions: that Doyle was the young factory worker pictured in a 1942 wartime photograph, and that the photograph had inspired commercial artist [[J. Howard Miller]] to create the poster. Though some media representations described the connection as unconfirmed, many more enthusiastically endorsed it. The weight of these multiple endorsements gave Doyle's story a "convincing" authority, despite the lack of authority in establishing the connection. In 2015 Kimble found the original photographic print of the factory worker, its caption identifying the young woman as [[Naomi Parker]], working in California in March 1942, when Doyle was still in high school.&lt;ref name=Kimble2016&gt;{{cite journal |title=Rosie's Secret Identity, or, How to Debunk a Woozle by Walking Backward through the Forest of Visual Rhetoric |last=Kimble |first=James J. |date=Summer 2016 |journal=Rhetoric and Public Affairs |volume=19 |number=2 |pages=245–74 |issn=1094-8392 |doi=10.14321/rhetpublaffa.19.2.0245}}&lt;/ref&gt;
