'''''27A''''' is a 1974 Australian film directed by [[Esben Storm]]. At the [[AACTA Awards|AFI Awards]] it won in the Best Actor ([[Robert McDarra]]) and Best Fiction ([[Haydn Keenan]]) categories.

==Plot==
Bill McDonald is a middle aged alcoholic who is sentenced to six weeks in prison for a minor offence. He volunteers for psychiatric treatment and is committed to a hospital for the criminally insane supposedly only for the duration of his prison sentence. However under section 27A of Queensland's Mental Health Act he can be held there until hospital authorities declare him eligible for release.

Bill clashes with a nurse, Cornish, and is detained in the hospital because of his attitude. He attempts three times to escape. Eventually he is released after a journalist publicises his case.

==Production==
Ebsen Storm and producer Haydn Keenan had made a number of successful short films and wanted to move into features. The script was developed by Storm in association with interviews he conducted in 1972 with Robert Somerville, a man who had been forcibly detained in a Queensland hospital in the late 1960s. By the time the film was made, however, section 27A had been repealed. [[Cecil Holmes (director)|Cecil Holmes]] worked as script editor. Storm:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The main influence on the style of the film was that we knew we wouldn't be able to raise a lot of money... If we wanted to make a feature film, we'd have to make it cheap. There was a style at that time, sort of pseudo-documentary, with a lot of hand-held camera work - ''Cullodden'', ''[[Cathy Come Home]]'' and ''[[Poor Cow]]'', that English, Ken Loach, Peter Watkins realism. I was drawn to the subject in the newspapers and then went off to investigate and research it. I felt that it would suit that style... A basic theme... is that of someone trying to break out, someone feeling trapped within themselves, trapped within the system. That probably drew me to it. Then when I went to research it, I found a broader tapestry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.signis.net/malone/tiki-index.php?page=Esben+Storm&amp;bl "Interview with Esben Storm", ''Signis'', 22 August 1995] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131103173228/http://www.signis.net/malone/tiki-index.php?page=Esben+Storm&amp;bl |date=3 November 2013 }} accessed 21 November 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Robert McDarra, who played the lead, was himself an alcoholic. Bill Hunter was cast in his first feature film role. $23,000 of the budget was raised from a syndicate of 18 businessmen, with $13,000 coming from a grant from the [[Australian Film Television Radio School]].&lt;ref name="pike"/&gt;&lt;ref name="stratton"&gt;David Stratton, ''The Last New Wave: The Australian Film Revival'', Angus &amp; Robertson, 1980 p191&lt;/ref&gt;

The film was shot on 16mm starting 28 February 1973 at Christian Brothers psychiatric hospital near Sydney.&lt;ref name="pike"/&gt;

==Release==
The film premiered at the [[Sydney Film Festival]] and achieved a limited release. It never recovered its costs, however it screened at a number of festivals and was critically acclaimed.&lt;ref name="stratton"/&gt;

The film won the AFI Award for Best Film. Robert McDarra won the AFI Award for his performance.

'''4 Pics 1 Word''' is a [[word puzzle]] game created by LOTUM GmbH, available for free on [[Android (operating system)|Android]] and [[iOS]].&lt;ref name="PCAdvisor"&gt;{{cite web|title=4 Pics 1 Word (What's The Word?) review|publisher=PC Advisor|url=http://www.pcadvisor.co.uk/reviews/google-android/3425589/4-pics-1-word-whats-word-review/|date=February 12, 2013 |accessdate=March 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Screenshot of 4 Pics 1 Word.png|thumbnail|Screenshot showing switch for in-game ads in lower left corner.]]

==Gameplay==
4 Pics 1 Word's gameplay is very simple: each level displays four pictures linked by one word - the player's aim is to work out what the word is, from a set of letters given below the pictures.&lt;ref name="AndroidCentral"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.androidcentral.com/4-pics-1-word-countless-time-spent-playing-game|title=4 Pics 1 Word: countless time spent playing this game|publisher=Android Central|date=February 21, 2013|accessdate=March 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game is said to follow the "[[freemium]]" model: although the game is free, [[microtransactions]] are available to help the user progress through the game more quickly.&lt;ref name="AndroidCentral"/&gt;

The game is written from an English dialect perspective, as well as contains some unfamiliar words, causing some people to turn to cheating sites or apps to get the correct answers. According to psychology PhD Jamie Madigan, “people are more likely to cheat when they are anonymous and that they’ll cheat less the more they are connected to other gamers — the more, in other words, that they are known.”.&lt;ref name="WordPlays.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wordplays.com/why-do-people-cheat-at-word-games/|title=WHY PEOPLE CHEAT AT WORD GAMES|publisher=WordPlays.com|accessdate=January 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="4 Pics 1 Word Answers"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.4pics-1wordanswers.com|title=4 Pics 1 Word Answers|accessdate=January 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An update in April 2013 added in-game ads, which can be removed with an in-game purchase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/4-pics-1-word/id595558452?mt=8 |title=4 Pics 1 Word for iPhone 3GS, iPhone 4, iPhone 4S, iPhone 5, iPod touch (3rd generation), iPod touch (4th generation), iPod touch (5th generation) and iPad |publisher=iTunes.apple.com |date=26 June 2013 |accessdate=9 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During January 2015 the daily puzzles have been given an overhaul by making each month based on countries or seasonal events like [[Christmas]], [[Halloween]] and [[Easter]]. The players are rewarded with badges relating to the month's current theme after they finish a certain amount of puzzles in a month.

==Reception==
4 Pics 1 Word has received mostly positive reviews. [[PC Advisor]] gave the Android version 4/5, praising its entertainment value, but stating that the social aspect could be improved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcadvisor.co.uk/reviews/google-android/3425589/4-pics-1-word-whats-word-review/?tab=verdictTab#top|title=4 Pics 1 Word (What's The Word?) review: Our Verdict|publisher=PC Advisor|date=February 12, 2013 |accessdate=March 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pocket-lint featured it as their "App of the Day" on the 25th February 2013, praising both its simplicity, and its social aspect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pocket-lint.com/news/50101/4-pics-1-word-review|title=APP OF THE DAY: 4 Pics 1 Word review (Android/iPhone)|publisher=Pocket-lint|date=February 25, 2013|accessdate=March 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; What Mobile also gave it 4/5, praising its simplicity and execution, whilst criticizing its frequency of highlighting the "hint" button.&lt;ref name="WhatMobile"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whatmobile.net/2013/02/19/game-review-4-pics-1-word/|title=Game Review: 4 Pics, 1 Word|publisher=What Mobile|date=February 19, 2013 |accessdate=March 21, 2013|first=Alex|last=Walls}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of March 21, 2013, the game is ranked 4th out of all free iPhone apps and Android apps, according to AppData.&lt;ref name="AppData"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://appdata.com/|title=AppData - Application Analytics for Facebook, iOS and Android|publisher=WebMediaBrands Inc|accessdate=March 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Chinese acrobat in midair being watched by other acrobats.jpg|thumb|upright|Chinese acrobat in midair after being propelled off a [[Springboard (gymnastics)|springboard]], China, 1987]]

'''Acrobatics''' (from [[Ancient Greek]] ἀκροβατέω, ''akrobateo'', "walk on tiptoe, strut"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Da%29krobate%2Fw ἀκροβατέω], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt;) is the performance of extraordinary human feats of [[balance (ability)|balance]], [[agility]], and [[motor coordination]]. It can be found in many of the [[performing arts]], [[sports]] (sporting) events, and [[martial arts]]. Acrobatics is most often associated with activities that make extensive use of gymnastic elements, such as [[acro dance]], [[circus]], and [[gymnastics]], but many other athletic activities — such as [[ballet]] and [[Diving (sport)|diving]] — may also employ acrobatics. Although acrobatics is most commonly associated with human body performance, it may also apply to other types of performance, such as [[aerobatics]].

==History==

[[File:Hydria acrobat BM VaseF232.jpg|thumb|170px|A female acrobat depicted on an [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] [[hydria]], c. 340-330 BC.]]
[[File:Antikensammlung Berlin 525.JPG|170px|thumb|Female acrobat shooting an [[Bow and arrow|arrow with a bow]] in her feet; [[Red-figure pottery|Gnathia style]] [[Ancient Greek pottery|''pelikai'' pottery]]; 4th century BC]]
Acrobatic traditions are found in many cultures, and there is evidence that the earliest such traditions occurred thousands of years ago. For example, [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] art from c. 2000 BC contains depictions of [[bull-leaping|acrobatic feats on the backs of bulls]]. [[Ancient Greeks]] and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] practiced acrobatics{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}, and the [[noble court]] displays of the [[Europe]]an [[Middle Ages]] would often include acrobatic performances that included [[juggling]]{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}.

In [[China]], acrobatics have been a part of the culture since the [[Han Dynasty|Western Han Dynasty]] (206 BC-AD 220). Acrobatics were part of village harvest [[festival]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.redpanda2000.com/history.htm redpanda2000]&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Tang Dynasty]], acrobatics saw much the same sort of development as European acrobatics saw during the Middle Ages, with court displays during the 7th through 10th century dominating the practice.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pasadena.edu/chinese/cultural/acrobatics.html Pasadena.edu]&lt;/ref&gt; Acrobatics continues to be an important part of modern [[Chinese variety art]].

Though the term initially applied to tightrope walking{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}, in the 19th century, a form of performance art including [[circus]] acts began to use the term as well. In the late 19th century, tumbling and other acrobatic and gymnastic activities became competitive sport in Europe.

Acrobatics has often served as a subject for fine art. Examples of this are paintings such as ''Acrobats at the Cirque Fernando (Francisca and Angelina Wartenberg)'' by [[Impressionist]] [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]], which depicts two German acrobatic sisters, [[Pablo Picasso]]'s 1905 ''[[Acrobat and Young Harlequin]]'', and ''[[:File:Vasnetsov Acrobats.jpg|Acrobats in a Paris suburb]]'' by [[Viktor Vasnetsov]].

==Types==

===Aerial===
An '''aerialist''' is an acrobat who performs in the air, on a suspended apparatus such as a [[trapeze]], [[corde lisse|rope]], [[cloud swing]], [[Cradle (circus act)|aerial cradle]], aerial pole, [[aerial silk]], or [[aerial hoop]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nica.com.au/dictionary|publisher=National Institute of Circus Arts|title=Circus Dictionary|accessdate=2009-10-01|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719162832/http://www.nica.com.au/dictionary|archivedate=2011-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Andrew''' "'''Andy'''" '''Hardy''' is a [[fictional character]] played by [[Mickey Rooney]] in a [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] series of sixteen films from 1937 to 1946, and includes a final film released in 1958 in an unsuccessful attempt to continue the series. Hardy and others were based on characters in the play ''Skidding'' by [[Aurania Rouverol]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.andyhardyfilms.com/ |title=Fan Site Home Page |publisher= AndyHardyfilms.com |accessdate=2013-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early films in the series were about the Hardy family as a whole, but later entries focused on the character of Andy Hardy. Rooney was the only member of the ensemble to appear in all 16 films. The Hardy films, which were enormously popular in their heyday, were sentimental comedies, celebrating ordinary American life.

==First film==
The initial Hardy film, ''[[A Family Affair (1937 film)|A Family Affair]]'' (1937), was based directly on Rouverol's play and was produced without a view to producing a series. It featured [[Lionel Barrymore]] as Judge Hardy and [[Spring Byington]] as Mrs. Hardy, Andy's parents, and Margaret Marquis as Andy's on-again-off-again sweetheart, Polly Benedict.

==Series==
{{refimprove section|date=August 2013}}
[[File:Love Finds Andy Hardy trailer.JPG|thumb|Judy Garland and Mickey Rooney in {{nowrap|''Love Finds Andy Hardy''}}]]

When the series was launched, most of the cast was changed, with the exception of Rooney, [[Cecilia Parker]] as Andy's older sister Marian Hardy, and [[Sara Haden]] as Aunt Milly (except for two films when Betsy Ross Clarke appeared as Milly). The second and subsequent films starred [[Lewis Stone]] as Judge Hardy, [[Fay Holden]] as Mrs. Hardy, and [[Ann Rutherford]] as Polly Benedict. The Hardys' oldest child, married daughter Joan Hardy Martin, appeared only in the first film.

Most of the movies were set in the Hardys' fictional hometown of Carvel, located in Idaho in the original play, but described in the films as being in the Midwest (except for the short ''Andy Hardy's Dilemma'' where Carvel is mentioned as being a suburb of Los Angeles). All of the films were sentimental comedies celebrating ordinary American life. The people in Carvel were generally pious, patriotic, generous, and tolerant. The town represented MGM  mogul [[Louis B. Mayer]]'s idealized vision of his adopted country.{{cn|date=August 2013}} 

The early movies focused on the Hardy family as a whole, but the character Andy soon became the center of the series, and his name was featured in the title of the fourth film and all films after the seventh (inclusive).&lt;ref name="1939hgy"&gt;''1939: Hollywood's Greatest Year''. [[Turner Classic Movies]], 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; They were a big factor in Rooney's rise to stardom. The first two Hardy films dealt with the danger of adultery among the younger generation, but the later ones avoided such controversial themes.{{cn|date=August 2013}}  

The central relationship in the movies was between Andy and his father. Judge Hardy, played by the grandfatherly looking Stone, was a man of absolute morality and integrity, with a stern demeanor, but a kind heart and droll sense of humor. A typical plot involved Andy getting into minor trouble with money or girls, usually because of youthful selfishness and a willingness to fudge the truth.{{cn|date=August 2013}} This would lead to a "man-to-man" talk with his father, after which Andy would do the right thing.  

In three films, Rooney was paired with [[Judy Garland]], beginning with ''[[Love Finds Andy Hardy]]'', and continuing with ''[[Andy Hardy Meets Debutante]]'' (1940) and ''[[Life Begins for Andy Hardy]]'' (1941). Garland's character, Betsy Booth, is an aspiring singer and she sings in the first two of these films. However, although Garland songs were planned for the final film, they were eventually dropped. Unlike Garland-Rooney films outside of the ''Andy Hardy'' series, Rooney's Hardy character is not a musician, so Garland and Rooney do not perform together in the Hardy films.

Rooney played the character continuously from age 16 to 25, when he appeared in   ''[[Love Laughs at Andy Hardy]]'' (1946), in which Andy returned to civilian life after fighting in World War II. Twelve years later, an attempt to revive the series with an older, wiser Andy was made in 1958 with ''[[Andy Hardy Comes Home]]'', but it turned out to be the final film in the series.  Thus, the Andy Hardy series ended with a "To Be Continued", which indeed has yet to be continued.

==Screen debuts==
The Andy Hardy series served as a platform for [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]] to introduce new performers, some of whom became stars themselves.&lt;ref name="1939hgy"/&gt; As examples, ''[[Love Finds Andy Hardy]]'' (1938) featured [[Lana Turner]] in one of her first film appearances, while ''[[Andy Hardy's Private Secretary]]'' (1941) launched [[Kathryn Grayson]]'s movie career, and ''[[Andy Hardy's Double Life]]'' (1942) marked the screen debut of [[Esther Williams]]. 

==Other adaptations==
===Public service announcements===
A number of [[public service announcement]]s involving the Andy Hardy character and his father were shown in theaters in the 1940s. A notable example had Andy trying to persuade his father to give him $200 for a car. Instead, his father took him on a tour of several charities that needed the money more. After each visit to a charity, the car Andy wanted to buy became more and more decrepit.

===Comic books===
In June 1947, ''Fiction House's Movie Comics'' published a comic book adaptation of the film ''Love Laughs at Andy Hardy''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comics.org/issue/5944/ |title=Movie Comics #3 |publisher= Comics.org |accessdate=2013-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Hollywood collectibles: the sequel | isbn= 0887405711 | first1= Dian |last1= Zillner | first2= Jeff |last2= Zillner | year= 1994}}{{page needed|date=August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Andy Hardy was also the subject of a six comic books published by Dell in 1952–1954.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.mycomicshop.com/search?TID=22054653 |title=Andy Hardy (1952 Dell) comic books |publisher=Mycomicshop.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The comic book: the one essential guide for comic book fans everywhere''  by Paul Sassienie  Chartwell Books, Inc., 1994&lt;/ref&gt; Only in the former does the drawing of Andy Hardy resemble Mickey Rooney.{{cn|date=August 2013}}

===Proposed television adaptation===
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2013}}
In the 1960s, NBC considered an Andy Hardy TV series, and MGM shot a [[pilot episode]] for the network in early 1962. [[Jimmy Hawkins]], who had teenage roles in several popular sitcoms, played Andy, and veteran character actor [[Philip Ober]] played Judge Hardy. Despite indications that the network would pick up the show for its [[1962–63 United States network television schedule|1962–63 season]], that never happened.

'''''Anno 1701''''', also marketed as '''''1701 A.D.''''', is a [[real-time strategy]] and [[city-building game|city building]] video game, part of the [[Anno (series)|''Anno'' series]]. It is developed by [[Related Designs]] and published by [[Sunflowers Interactive Entertainment Software]]. It revolves around building and maintaining an 18th-century colony in the "New World". With a budget of €10 million, it was the most expensive German game ever produced by 2006. 

It is the sequel to ''[[Anno 1602]]'' and ''[[Anno 1503]]'' and was followed by ''[[Anno 1404]]'', which is known in the United States as ''Dawn of Discovery'', ''[[Anno 2070]]'', ''[[Anno 2205]]'' and [[Anno 1800]]''.

==Gameplay==
''Anno 1701'', like the other six Anno games, is a game based mainly on the economics of the settlement created by the player. The more skilled a player is at maintaining a balanced economy the more successful their settlement will be.

As with other ''Anno'' games, the player starts as an unnamed country which has to colonize and expand in the game world. While the player expands, other computer controlled rivals are expanding and strengthening.  As the player progresses through the game, players have access to lodge activities and troops which allow them to invade and ultimately to defeat other players.

The game is divided into five social stages: Pioneer, Settler, Citizen, Merchant, and Aristocrat. At the start of the game, all of a player's citizens are pioneers. They pay little amounts of taxes, and require only food and a town center. As a player's empire develops, so does his population. They begin upgrading (provided they have sufficient goods), paying more taxes, but also requiring more goods, such as tobacco products, perfume, lamp oil, and much more. It is crucial for a player to develop quickly, as not much profit is attained until reaching the merchant stage.

Players can trade with other opponents settling under the Queen's name, or with foreign cultures. All foreign cultures are on small or medium islands, and cannot leave their island.

Liang Wu and his Asians are found on islands in the north of the island world. They trade the colonial good Jade, and purchase food.

Poxacoatl and his Aztecs live on  islands in the southern zone, are few in number and believe in the infinite power of the gods.  They trade the colonial goods Talismans, and purchase cloth and horses.

Amin Sahir and his Indians have a small settlement on one of the  islands in the southern end of the island world. Their Indian Ivory is a desirable colonial good.

Tetonka and his Iroquois are situated in a dense forest on one of the  islands in the northern zone of the island world. The Iroquois trade furs, and purchase tobacco products and weapons.

Ramirez and his Pirates take refuge in expertly concealed hideouts in the southern zone of the island world. Due to their aggressive nature they take rich rewards from raids, therefore they can offer all colonial goods.

''Anno 1701'' is almost entirely focused on trade and economics, leaving little left over for war tactics. The combat has been simplified in some respects compared to the previous ''Anno'' game (''Anno 1503''), which makes it less involved and less difficult for new players.

''1701'' has a wealth of enhancements that distinguish it from its two predecessors, ''[[Anno 1503]]'' and ''[[Anno 1602]]''. These developments include:

;The Queen
Now, players are settling the island world in the queen's name. Thus, she expects subservience and respect. Late in the game, she will begin demanding for tribute, giving you the choice to pay thousands of gold coins, or being attacked by her royal fleet. Either option will eventually lead to independence. Different opponents have different relationships with the queen. Deciding to attack the queen can upset many honorable opponents, while paying tribute can upset others.

;Trader Assignments
The Free Trader, a neutral merchant who sails his fleet around the world to trade, can offer players opportunities to assist him in matters. The assignments are optional, but the reward is immense, and sometimes crucial to financial success. In some assignments, players have to deliver select goods, while in others, players have to destroy ships.

;Guests of Honour
Traveling dignitaries can now visit your city and enhance the quality and power of a player's empire. For example, when the smith arrives, he replenishes tool supplies. The entertainers can brighten the moods of the populace, leading to increased tax revenue. Guests of honor come at random times during each social stage of the game, and can also be called to visit once the senate is unlocked.

;Tax Control
Unlike in the previous game in the series, [[Anno 1503]], players can choose how much to tax their people, bringing back an old system that was featured in the first ANNO game. Low taxes are required for a social upgrade and please the people, while higher taxes lead to revolt and a lower population.

;New Goods
The new goods available include chocolate, perfume, and colonial goods (Ivory, Jade, Talismans, Furs). Also, goods can now be purchased in a ''village center'', instead of at individual stands that had to be built individually in previous Anno games.

;Lodge Activities

Lodge activities are accessed at the beginning of the game, although only the spy is available for use. All the other lodge activities are researched throughout the game at either a school or a university. Some of the very powerful activities available to players include the deployment of the poisoner (who introduces the plague to an opponent's settlement) or the demagogue (who can rally workers to walk away from their jobs).

;Natural Disasters
Players are now subject to Mother Nature's wrath. Hurricanes, earthquakes, and volcanic eruptions all have the power to destroy settlements. Diseases are also rampant in the 1701 AD world, specifically the plague, which can wipe out hundreds, or even thousands, of people.  The plague of rats can ruin tons of goods as well.

==Development==
''Anno 1701'' was the most expensive German game ever made at the time of its release, with a budget of €10 million.&lt;ref name=ausland&gt;{{cite web | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20181203004848/https://www.gamestar.de/artikel/deutsche-spiele-im-ausland,1462953.html |url=https://www.gamestar.de/artikel/deutsche-spiele-im-ausland,1462953.html | title=Deutsche Spiele im Ausland | date=July 19, 2006 | author=Staff | work=[[GameStar]] | archivedate=December 3, 2018 | language=[[German language|German]] | deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
===Sales===
As ''[[Anno 1602]]'' and ''[[Anno 1503]]'' had been commercial hits, together totaling 4.5 million units sold worldwide, pre-release sales estimates for ''Anno 1701'' were high. Retailers purchased 450,000 units in Germany in preparation for the game's launch; worldwide pre-orders from stores reached roughly 1 million copies.&lt;ref name=450k&gt;{{cite web | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100101213836/https://www.n-tv.de/technik/Teuerstes-Spiel-aus-Deutschland-article337536.html | url=https://www.n-tv.de/technik/Teuerstes-Spiel-aus-Deutschland-article337536.html | title=Teuerstes Spiel aus Deutschland | author=Staff | date=October 23, 2006 | archivedate=January 1, 2010 | work=[[n-tv]] | language=[[German language|German]] | deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''[[Der Spiegel]]'', the game and its predecessors were aimed at mainstream [[casual game|casual players]] who "buy a game once a year and spend weeks with it", a goal reflected in the new title's pre-release television advertising. Publisher [[Sunflowers Interactive]] noted a high percentage of female players among the ''Anno'' series' fanbase, and they were a target demographic for ''Anno 1701''.&lt;ref name=spiegel&gt;{{cite web | archiveurl=http://archive.is/QMaBW | url=http://www.spiegel.de/netzwelt/web/spiel-anno-1701-sky-du-mont-wird-hardcoregamer-a-444903.html | title=Sky Du Mont wird Hardcoregamer | author=Görig, Carsten | work=[[Der Spiegel]] | date=October 27, 2006 | archivedate=December 3, 2018 | language=[[German language|German]] | deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Archie's Holiday Fun Digest''''' was an annual holiday-themed comics collection for [[Archie Comics]], issued as part of the [[Archie Digest Library]].

The book revolves around the [[Christmas]] season and draws on typical situations of that time of year, from what to buy for everyone, snow removal, parties, caroling and such.  Usually there is some money problems like the gang not having enough money for all of their gifts or Betty teaching Veronica the real reason of the season. 

There are some religious stories as well such as [[Betty Cooper|Betty]] and [[Veronica Lodge|Veronica]] attending church or creating religious cards for their friends. 

Usually at the end of the digest are various pin up pages with various messages that relate to the season such as "Merry Christmas" or "Happy Holidays"

After 2007, the 12th annual issue the title didn't return the following year for unknown reasons.  Instead a holiday themed issue of the long running Archie Digest title has been printed.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2466">'''Asia Poker''' is a [[casino]] [[table game]] similar to [[Pai gow poker]] that is now popular in most [[Atlantic City, New Jersey]] casinos. Players are dealt seven cards and divide their cards into three hands: a four-card hand (High), a two-card hand (Medium) and a one-card hand (Low). The four-card hand must be equal or greater in poker ranking than the two-card hand and the two-card hand must be equal or greater than the one-card hand. After all players have set their hand, the dealer sets the house's hand according to the "house way" and then compares each player's hand to the house's hand. If the house wins at least two out of three hands, the player loses. If the player wins at least two or out of three hands the player wins. Unlike Pai gow poker, the casino does not charge a 5% [[vigorish]] for winning wagers. Rather, the house edge comes from winning all "copy hands" (a player's hand that is identical to the house's hand). Also, unlike Pai gow poker there are no ties in this game; the player either wins or loses. The House edge figures to be around 3% based on the probability of the player having a losing copy hand.&lt;ref name="wiza_Asia"&gt;{{Cite web| title = Asia Poker| work = Wizard Of Odds| accessdate = 2016-03-17| url = http://wizardofodds.com/games/asia-poker/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="theb_Borg"&gt;{{Cite web| title = Borgata Table Games| work = Borgata| accessdate = 2016-03-17| url = https://www.theborgata.com/casino/games/table-games/table-games-guide}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wsgc_"&gt;{{Cite web| title = Fortune Asia Poker| author = Tina Griffin| work = State of Washington Gambling Commission| accessdate = 2016-03-17| url = http://www.wsgc.wa.gov/activities/game-rules/fortune-asia-poker.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Asia Poker a [[straight (poker)|straight]] or [[flush (cards)|flush]] can be played only in the four-card hand and they beat [[three-of-a-kind]] or worse. The best High hand is [[four-of-a-kind]] and the second best is a straight flush. The best Medium hand is two aces and the best Low hand is an ace.

'''Benbros (London) Ltd''' was a British toy company in existence from the late 1940s&lt;ref name=Ramsey&gt;{{cite book|last=Ramsey|first=John|title=British Diecast Model Toys Catalogue|publisher=Swapmeet Publications|date=1995|page=21|isbn=0950931993}}&lt;/ref&gt; to 1965.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fabtintoys.com/Benbros/|title=Benbros Ltd|website=fabtintoys|accessdate=5 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company was founded by two brothers, Jack and Nathan Benenson,&lt;ref name=Ramsey/&gt; the name, a contraction of "Benenson Brothers", was adopted in 1951&lt;ref name=Ramsey/&gt; and the company was based at 145, Gosport Road, [[Walthamstow]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://homepage.ntlworld.com/d.jones7317/public_html/3index/benbros.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=21 October 2008|deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081024171034/http://homepage.ntlworld.com/d.jones7317/public_html/3index/benbros.htm |archivedate=24 October 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Benbros produced:

A '''blockbuster''' is a work of entertainment – especially a [[feature film]], but also other media – that is highly popular and financially successful. The term has also come to refer to any large-budget production ''intended'' for "blockbuster" status, aimed at mass markets with associated merchandising, sometimes on a scale that meant the financial fortunes of a film studio or a distributor could depend on it.

==Etymology==
The term began to appear in the American press in the early 1940s,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?year_start=1800&amp;year_end=2008&amp;corpus=15&amp;smoothing=7&amp;case_insensitive=on&amp;content=blockbuster&amp;direct_url=t4;,blockbuster;,c0;,s0;;blockbuster;,c0;;Blockbuster;,c0;;BLOCKBUSTER;,c0|title=Google Ngram Viewer|website=books.google.com|access-date=2018-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; referring to [[Blockbuster bomb|aerial bombs capable of destroying a whole block of buildings]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/blockbuster|title=blockbuster {{!}} Definition of blockbuster in English by Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries {{!}} English|access-date=2018-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its first known use in reference to films was in May 1943, when advertisements in ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' and ''[[Motion Picture Herald]]'' described the [[RKO]] film, ''[[Bombardier (film)|Bombardier]]'', as "The block-buster of all action-thrill-service shows!" Another trade advertisement in 1944 boasted that the war documentary, ''[[With the Marines at Tarawa]]'', "hits the heart like a two ton blockbuster". Several theories have been put forward for the origin of the term in a film context. One explanation pertains to the practice of "[[block booking]]" whereby a studio would sell a package of films to theaters, rather than permitting them to select which films they wanted to exhibit. However, this practice was outlawed in 1948 before the term became common parlance; while pre-1948 high-grossing big-budget spectacles may be retrospectively labelled "blockbusters", this is not how they were known at the time. Another explanation is that trade publications would often advertise the popularity of a film by including illustrations showing long queues often extending around the block, but in reality the term was never used in this way. The term was actually first coined by publicists who drew on readers' familiarity with the blockbuster bombs, drawing an analogy with the bomb's huge impact. The trade press subsequently appropriated the term as short-hand for a film's commercial potential. Throughout 1943 and 1944 the term was applied to films such as ''[[Bataan (film)|Bataan]]'', ''[[No Time for Love (1943 film)|No Time for Love]]'' and ''[[Brazil (1944 film)|Brazil]]''.&lt;ref name="Hall (2014)"&gt;{{cite web |first=Sheldon |last=Hall |title=Pass the ammunition : a short etymology of “Blockbuster" |year=2014 |publisher=Sheffield Hallam University Research Archive |url=http://shura.shu.ac.uk/6809/3/Hall_Etymology_of_Blockbuster_(rev).pdf |accessdate=25 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term fell out of usage in the aftermath of [[World War II]] but was revived in 1948 by ''Variety'' in an article about big budget films. By the early 1950s the term had become standardised within the film industry and the trade press to denote a film that was large in spectacle, scale and cost, that would go on to achieve a high gross. In December 1950 the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' predicted that ''[[Samson and Delilah (1949 film)|Samson and Delilah]]'' would be "a box office block buster", and in November 1951 ''Variety'' described ''[[Quo Vadis (1951 film)|Quo Vadis]]'' as "a b.o. blockbuster [...] right up there with ''[[The Birth of a Nation|Birth of a Nation]]'' and ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone With the Wind]]'' for boxoffice performance [...] a super-spectacle in all its meaning".&lt;ref name="Hall (2014)" /&gt;

==Blockbuster era==
In 1975, the usage of "blockbuster" for films coalesced around [[Steven Spielberg]]'s ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]''. It was perceived as a new cultural phenomenon: a fast-paced, exciting entertainment, inspiring interest and conversation beyond the theatre (which would later be called "[[marketing buzz|buzz]]"), and repeated viewings.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tom Shone]]: ''[[Blockbuster (2004 book)|Blockbuster]]'' (2004). London, Simon &amp; Schuster UK. {{ISBN|0-7432-6838-5}}. See pp. 27–40.&lt;/ref&gt; The film is regarded as the first film of the "blockbuster era", and founded the blockbuster film genre.&lt;ref&gt;Neale, Steve. "Hollywood Blockbusters: Historical Dimensions." Ed. Julien Stinger. ''Hollywood Blockbusters''. London: Routeledge, 2003. pp. 48–50. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later, ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' expanded on the success of ''Jaws'', setting box office records and enjoying a theatrical run that lasted more than a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cinematreasures.org/blog/2012/5/25/celebrating-the-original-star-wars-on-its-35th-anniversary|title=Celebrating the Original STAR WARS on its 35th Anniversary|last=|first=|date=|website=cinematreasures.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the success of ''Jaws'' and ''Star Wars'', many Hollywood producers attempted to create similar "event" films with wide commercial appeal, and film companies began [[green-light]]ing increasingly large-budget films, and relying extensively on massive advertising blitzes leading up to their theatrical release. These two films were the prototypes for the "summer blockbuster" trend,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2015/film/news/jaws-40th-anniversary-at-40-box-office-summer-blockbuster-1201521198/|title=‘Jaws’ 40th Anniversary: How Steven Spielberg’s Movie Created the Summer Blockbuster|last=Gray|first=Tim|date=2015-06-18|work=Variety|access-date=2018-01-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which [[major film studio]]s and distributors planned their annual marketing strategy around a big release by July 4.&lt;ref&gt;Shone (2004), Chapter 1.&lt;/ref&gt; The next fifteen years saw a number of high-quality blockbusters released including the likes of ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'' (1979) and its sequel, ''[[Aliens (film)|Aliens]]'' (1986), the first three [[Indiana Jones (franchise)|Indiana Jones]] films (1981, 1984 and 1989), ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial|E.T.]]'' (1982), ''[[Ghostbusters]]'' (1984), ''[[Beverly Hills Cop]]'' (1984), the ''[[Back to the Future (franchise)|Back to the Future]]'' trilogy (1985, 1989 and 1990), ''[[Top Gun]]'' (1986), ''[[Die Hard]]'' (1988), ''[[Batman (1989 film)|Batman]]'' (1989) and its sequel ''[[Batman Returns]]'' (1992), and ''[[The Hunt for Red October (film)|The Hunt for Red October]]'' (1990).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/06/22/did-jaws-and-star-wars-ruin-hollywood/|title=Did 'Jaws' and 'Star Wars' Ruin Hollywood?|work=Ross Douthat|access-date=2018-01-09|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually, the focus on creating blockbusters grew so intense that a backlash occurred, with critics and some film-makers decrying the prevalence of a "[[blockbuster mentality]]" and lamenting the death of the author-driven, "more artistic" small-scale films of the [[New Hollywood]] era. This view is taken, for example, by film journalist [[Peter Biskind]], who wrote that all studios wanted was another ''Jaws'', and as production costs rose, they were less willing to take risks, and therefore based blockbusters on the "lowest common denominators" of the mass market.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Biskind: ''[[Easy Riders, Raging Bulls|Easy Riders, Raging Bulls: How the Sex-Drugs-And Rock 'N Roll Generation Saved Hollywood]]''. Simon and Schuster, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; In his book ''The Long Tail'', [[Chris Anderson (writer)|Chris Anderson]]  talks about blockbuster films, stating that a society that is hit-driven, and makes way and room for only those films that are expected to be a hit, is in fact a limited society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Anderson |first=Chris |title=The Long Tail |url=http://www.longtail.com/bloggingheroes.pdf |publisher=Chris Anderson |accessdate=April 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|caption      =Monsignor [[Charles Martial Lavigerie]] (1825–1892) was the founder of the [[White Fathers]]; he contributed to the spread of social Christian and educational institutions within [[French Algeria]]. This [[oil on canvas]] was painted in 1888 by [[Léon Bonnat]] (1833–1922), who was a French painter and a portraitist. It was purchased by the [[France|French State]] for the national collection and was initially displayed at the [[Luxembourg Museum]]. Subsequently, it was displayed at exhibitions which took place in Moscow and in Chicago. Currently, it is on display at the gallery of historical portraits in [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]]. This painting became well known due to the fact that its engraved reproduction was used during the Toast of Algiers, where Bishop [[Charles Lavigerie]] urged the French [[Catholic]]s – most of them fervent [[Royalist]]s – to join the French [[republican government]].

The '''Catholic youth sports associations of French Algeria''' ({{lang-fr|link=no|'''patronages de l'Algérie française'''}}) first appeared in major cities in northern [[Algeria]] at the beginning of the 20th century and were mainly reserved for young European people.&lt;ref name="FAT2004_p209"&gt;{{harvnb|Fatès|2004|p=209|ref=Fatès_2004}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fatès|2004|p=203|ref=Fatès_2004}}.&lt;/ref&gt; By the start of the [[First World War]] some of the associations had joined the [[Fédération internationale catholique d'éducation physique et sportive]], with women's organizations rapidly following suit and joining the [[m:fr:Rayon sportif féminin|Rayon sportif féminin]] – a French catholic sporting organisation for women.&lt;ref name="FAT2004_p213"&gt;{{harvnb|Fatès|2004|p=213|ref=Fatès_2004}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to the situation in the North, the spread of sports through the southern regions of Algeria, under the auspices of the [[White Fathers]] (Pères Blancs), predominantly involved the indigenous populations.&lt;ref name="FAT2004_p209"/&gt;

[[File:Stemma big.png|thumb|150px|left|[[Coat of arms]] of [[Salesian]]s referring to [[Saint John Bosco]].]]

The first of the Catholic youth sports associations were established in [[Algiers]] in 1913,&lt;ref name="FAT2004_p210"&gt;{{harvnb|Fatès|2004|p=210|ref=Fatès_2004}}.&lt;/ref&gt; namely: St. Croix (which was already involved with working class youth), St. Joseph Hussein Dey, and l’Avenir d’El Biar. They were created through an initiative of the [[Salesians of Don Bosco]] and the [[Congregation of the Sacred Heart of Jesus]] and catered predominantly to young people of European origin. They immediately became affiliated with the Fédération gymnastique et sportive des patronages de France (FGSPF), and their focus, as with the associations in France, was the provision of moral instruction and [[military|military training]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fatès|2004|pp=209–210|ref=Fatès_2004}}.&lt;/ref&gt; They were organised into regional unions in which both religious and secular people, including women, shared responsibilities.{{#tag:ref|In 1946 the ''Union régionale d'Oran'' was chaired by Canon Fabre; with Father Jean, priest of [[Lourmel Airfield|Lourmel]], as secretary; a Mr. Perisson as vice president; and a Mr. Fonclair as treasurer. A Eugene Simon was chair of the Regional Union of Algiers in the same year.|group=N|name="Simon"}} The first such union was established in [[Oran]] in November 1913 by a Father Koëger.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fatès|2004|pp=211–212|ref=Fatès_2004}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Development of the associations continued after the [[First World War]]: the Union régionale de la province d'Alger listed six associations in 1924,&lt;ref name="FAT2004_p210"/&gt; then nine by 1928. France supported and monitored these developments, and following an appeal by Monsignor Auguste-Fernand Leynaud,&lt;ref name="Leynaud"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/bishop/bleyn.html|title= Archbishop Auguste-Fernand Leynaud (1865–1953)|author=C†H |authorlink=|work= The Hierarchy of the Catholic Church: Current and historical information about its bishops and dioceses |publisher= |location= |at=catholic-hierarchy.org|language= |trans-title=|accessdate=4 November 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Archbishop of Algiers, 70 Catholic youth sports associations from various [[Departments of France|French departments]] – such as [[Bouches-du-Rhône]], Alsace, [[Seine]], [[Rhône]], Landes, and [[Maine et Loire]] – took 3000 gymnasts and 500 musicians across the [[Mediterranean]] to participate in a large competition for federation member associations. The competition was organised to mark the centenary of [[French Algeria]] and was held on 14 June 1930.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hervet1948|p=80–144}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three specially arranged boats set off from [[Marseille]]: the ''Lamoricière'', the ''duc d'Aumale'', and the ''Espagne''. On board, the executive team was made up of [[m:fr:François Hébrard|François Hebrard]] (a French law professor and leading sports bureaucrat), [[m:fr:Armand Thibaudeau|Armand Thibaudeau]] (a Catholic youth sports association leader who played an important part in the development of basketball in France), and Mr.{{Verify source|date=October 2011}} Simounet, who was the official representative of the [[Under Secretary of State]] for [[Physical Education]]. Avant-Garde Saint-Denis was the team of the competition and Robert Herold was the individual champion.

The competition was followed by a reception hosted by the [[Governor General]], Pierre-Louis Borde. Two wreaths were also laid at a [[war memorial]], one by the {{abbr|FGSPF|Fédération internationale catholique d'éducation physique et sportive}}, and the other by a [[Religion in France|Catholic organisation]] from [[Alsace]] which had brought 11 organisations to the competition. A trip to [[Sidi-Ferruch]] followed, where Monsignor Auguste-Fernand Leynaud&lt;ref name="Leynaud" /&gt; laid the foundation stone for the city's church; two special trains and 18 buses were laid on for the occasion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Fédération internationale catholique d'éducation physique et sportive]] (FGSPF)|title=For those returning from Algiers|series=Youth|number=455 |date=29 June 1930 |pages=401–409}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alger added one further association in 1931, and then in 1932 the Spartans of Eckmülh,&lt;ref group=N name="Eckmuhl"&gt;Eckmülh is a district of [[Oran]].&lt;/ref&gt; Oran, were created by Father Bailly, who had connections with the [[Don Bosco]] youth association,&lt;ref name="clochers"/&gt; which was founded in January 1893 by the [[Salesian]]s. The Spartans soon became the largest [[basketball club]] in Algeria, with some of the players selected for the French national team.&lt;ref name="FAT2004_p211"&gt;{{harvnb|Fatès|2004|p=211|ref=Fatès_2004}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1936, Father Bailly's teams won all the titles in the [[Oran]] region, with the first team becoming champions of [[Algeria]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Fédération internationale catholique d'éducation physique et sportive]] (FGSPF) Young, Number 770, 14 March 1937 p.{{Verify source|date=October 2011}}&lt;!--Which page number is this reference relating to? Please, kindly add this additional information, if you owe it! Thank you beforehand!--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Second World War]], and as 1948–49 champions of North Africa, the Spartans beat the [[Military history of France|French military]] team by 22 points. They then beat the 1949 [[m:fr:championnat de France de basket-ball|French champions]], [[Villeurbanne]], and were crowned champions of the [[French Union]] on 11 June 1949; [[Oran]] became the basketball capital of North Africa as a result. After [[Algerian War|Algerian Independence]] the Spartans continued their involvement with basketball and gymnastics.&lt;ref name="ref-1"&gt;{{harvnb|Fatès|2009|p=47|ref=Fatès_2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the Algerian associations were ahead of their time. In 1931, the association of St. Philip of Algiers, founded in 1922&lt;ref&gt;St. Philip of Algiers, founded under the Statement No. 921, on 24 April 1922, as published in the Official Gazette No. 124 of 7 May 1922.&lt;/ref&gt; and in which sport, such as gymnastics, and [[military|military training]] took place, began to allow female membership, including within their administration.&lt;ref name="FAT2004_p211"/&gt; Members had to be of majority age, have French nationality, and be entitled to exercise their civil and political rights however.{{#tag:ref|However, one should remember that the [[m:fr:loi|1901 law]] attributes the unenviable status of ''foreign association'' to any association whose sole director is a foreigner.|group=N|name="loi_1901"}}

The ''Olympique du Petit Séminaire'' {{#tag:ref|In English: Little Seminary Olympic.|group=N|name="OPS"}} (OPS) was the last Catholic youth sports association created in Algeria and was founded during the insurgency.{{#tag:ref|The ''Olympique du Petit Séminaire'' was founded on 8 July 1959, via publication in the Journal officiel de l'Algérie (Official [[Gazette]] of Algeria) number 167, 22 July 1959.|group=N|name="JO"}} All those in charge at the OPS belonged to the social elite, and one was a member of the [[Civil Constitution of the Clergy|Clergy]]. In addition to teaching gymnastics and providing [[military|military training]] (including training in the use of rifles), the association encouraged the practice of other sports. It also encouraged [[choir]] singing as well as organizing recreational sessions and [[summer camps|holiday camps]]. The association's statutes did not permit the admission of foreigners.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fatès|2004|p=52|ref=Fatès_2004}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 January 1963, during the year following Algerian independence, the statutes of the OPS were changed: military training was brought to an end and the association was renamed ''Olympique de Saint-Eugène'' (OSE), placing less emphasis on religion; membership continued to be made up of French nationals however. The OSE finally ceased to exist in 1967.&lt;ref name="FAT2004_p212"&gt;{{harvnb|Fatès|2004|p=212|ref=Fatès_2004}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to this, on 1 July 1962, during the gymnastics and music championships of the Féderation Sportive de France (FSF) in [[Troy]], a young gymnast and lawyer representing the Algerian unions, [[m:fr:Olivier Gilbert|Olivier Gilbert]], had returned the flag of the Algerian youth associations to the president of the FSF.

Female members of the religious establishment were responsible for the creation of Catholic women's sports associations in Algeria after the [[First World War]];&lt;ref name="FAT2004_p211"/&gt; the Dragonflies of the Redoubt, of [[Birmandreis]], were founded in 1926 for example.&lt;ref name="FAT2004_p211"/&gt; However, the spread of these associations mainly took place just before the Second World War:&lt;ref name="FAT2004_p213"/&gt; the ''Mouettes Oranaises'' were founded in Oran in 1938, then the ''Hirondelles de Notre Dame d’Afrique'', the ''Mouettes'', the ''Mimosas du champ de manœuvre'', the ''Marguerites de Mustapha'', the ''Capucines de Belcourt'', the ''Glycines de Mustapha'', the ''Coquelicots de Mustapha'', the ''Rayon Sportif féminin algérien'', the ''Bleuets d’Alger'', the ''Boutons d’Or de Kouba'', the '' Bruyères d’Hussein Dey'' and the ''Cyclamens de Bab El Oued'' were founded in Algiers the following year.&lt;ref name="FAT2004_p213"/&gt;

All these associations were affiliated with the [[m:fr:Rayon sportif féminin|Rayon sportif féminin]], founded in 1919 by the [[Daughters of Charity of Saint Vincent de Paul]].{{#tag:ref|In French the [[Daughters of Charity of Saint Vincent de Paul]] are also known as both the [[m:fr:Sœurs de Saint Vincent de Paul|Filles de la Charité]] and the [[m:fr:Sœurs de Saint Vincent de Paul|Filles de la Charité de Saint Vincent de Paul]].&lt;ref name="charité"&gt;{{fr icon}} [http://www.filles-de-la-charite.org/fr/ Les Filles de la Charité de Saint Vincent de Paul]: official website.&lt;/ref&gt;|name="charité"|group=N}}&lt;ref name="FAT2004_p213"/&gt; The regional overseas committees of the Rayon sportif féminin were created in 1937,&lt;ref name="FAT2004_p213" /&gt; on the initiative of [[m:fr: Marie-Thérèse Eyquem|Marie-Thérèse Eyquem]]. In addition to gymnastics, the sports practised included basketball, volleyball, [[prisonball]], swimming, canoeing, and cycling.&lt;ref name="FAT2004_p213"/&gt; In each diocese, the chaplain provided the instructors with spiritual training – which remained the prerogative of the clergy and directors of the associations. The Rayon sportif féminin insisted on leaders and instructors being practising Catholics: {{cquote|''It's not about encouraging them into the church; it's about bringing the church into their lives.''{{#tag:ref|Original French quote: ''Il ne s’agit pas de les faire entrer à l’église, mais de mettre l’église dans leur vie''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Fédération internationale catholique d'éducation physique et sportive]] (FGSPF)|title={{Verify source|date=October 2011}}|series=Young|number=3 |date=15 January 1939 |pages={{page needed|date=June 2013}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=N|name="church"}}}}

Like the men's associations, the regional unions of the RSF organized large competitions. These were placed under the authority of the highest ranking colonial officials. A prayer to [[Joan of Arc]] was offered at the competitions, together with a flag raising ceremony.&lt;ref name="FAT2004_p214"&gt;{{harvnb|Fatès|2004|p=214|ref=Fatès_2004}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The regional unions also provided training sessions for diocese-level association leaders,{{#tag:ref|First course instructors of the Diocese of Oran, 14 September 1942 thus providing physical education instructors for schools, as well as managers for the youth sports associations,.&lt;ref name="FAT2004_p214"/&gt;|group=N|name="diocesan"}} supported and supervised through the management framework based in France. It was during a mission to Algiers in this context, during the autumn of 1942, that [[m:fr:Eugenie Duisit|Eugenie Duisit]], Deputy Secretary-General of the FGSPF, the authoritative body for France's [[zone libre]] at the time, joined the [[Free French Forces]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fatès|2004|pp=214–217|ref=Fatès_2004}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Female Muslim participation in the associations was low, though it increased with the [[Algerian war|war of independence]]. Notable examples of those who did participate are: Nini Derdéche Philippeville, the all-round French cross country runner-up in 1956,&lt;ref name="FAT2004_p214"/&gt; and Lila Khelif from Algiers, Algerian 1956 junior 800m, shot put, and javelin champion.&lt;ref name="FAT2004_p214"/&gt; Catholic female youth sports associations, which for so long had been the exclusive reserve of Europeans, nevertheless largely ceased to exist with the arrival of Algerian independence.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fatès|2004|p=215|ref=Fatès_2004}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the north of Algeria was divided into three French Algerian departments from 1902 (Algiers, Oran, and [[Constantine, Algeria|Constantine]]), Southern Algeria was made up of four militarily administered areas ([[Ghardaïa]], [[Ain Sefra]], [[Touggourt]], and Oasis (whose seat was in [[Adrar, Algeria|Adrar]]); [[:fr:Territoires du Sud|fr]]) until the statute of 20 September 1947 gave these areas department status as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fatès|2004|pp=203–204|ref=Fatès_2004}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Up until that time, the [[French Foreign Legion]], the [[m:fr:bataillons d’Afrique|African battalions]] and the Saharan [[Méhariste]]s (a kind of French cavalry, but with camels rather than horses) had been responsible for introducing participation sport to the South: they had indigenous people build tennis courts, additional to those already in existence at the larger hotels.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fatès|2004|p=205|ref=Fatès_2004}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This only contributed to a limited extent to the spread of participation sport amongst the indigenous population however.&lt;ref name="FAT2004_p206"&gt;{{harvnb|Fatès|2004|p=206|ref=Fatès_2004}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It was mainly down to another institution,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fatès|2004|pp=206–207|ref=Fatès_2004}}.&lt;/ref&gt; one which often had a close and complementary relationship with the military, to achieve that on a significant scale.&lt;ref name="FAT2004_p210"/&gt;

This photograph was taken by Albert Capelle, in Paris, France, in 1882.]]

Cardinal [[Charles Martial Lavigerie]], professor of ecclesiastical history at the Sorbonne from 1854 to 1856, then bishop of [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Nancy|Nancy]] in 1863, was appointed Bishop of Algiers in 1867{{#tag:ref| {{fr icon}} J’ai grandi au milieu des clochers, ''Point de vue'', by [[m:fr:Abdelkader Djemaï|Abdelkader Djemaï]].&lt;ref group=lower-roman name="Abdelkader_Djemaï"&gt;[[m:fr:Abdelkader Djemaï|Abdelkader Djemaï]] is a writer and author of about fifteen novels and stories, including: ''Camus à Oran'' ([[m:fr:éditions Michalon|éditions Michalon]]), ''Pain'', ''Adour et fantaisie'' (éditions Le Castor astral), ''Gare du Nord'' and ''Un moment d'oubli'' (éditions [[Éditions du Seuil|Le Seuil]]).&lt;/ref&gt; ''Le Monde'', 17 December 2004, 17:22.

His outstanding management of the [[cholera]] outbreak which occurred there earned him great popularity amongst the Muslim population.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fatès|2004|p=216|ref=Fatès_2004}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Named [[primate (bishop)|Primate]] of Africa and the apostolic delegate for [[Sahara]]&lt;ref name="FAT2004_p206"/&gt; and the [[Sudan]] by [[Pius IX]] in 1884, he founded the [[Charles Martial Lavigerie#Missionary|Missionary Society of the White Fathers]] to work with the tribes of [[M'zab]]. They cared for the sick, evangelized, and provided schooling for children.&lt;ref name="FAT2004_p207"&gt;{{harvnb|Fatès|2004|p=207|ref=Fatès_2004}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The creation of sports associations, in addition to clinics and schools, enabled daily contact with young people, and from 1884 the White Fathers were already playing a role in the spread of sport; firstly amongst the local [[Kabylie|Kabyle]] populations,&lt;ref name="FAT2004_p207"/&gt; then throughout the wider southern region.

Members of the religious establishment, in conjunction with the military, very quickly began organizing ''méhari'' races (a ''méhari'' is a type of camel.{{#tag:ref|''Méhara'' was originally an Arabic masculine singular noun&lt;ref name="mehara"&gt;{{fr icon}} [http://dictionnaire.reverso.net/ French-definition/méhara Definition of ''méhara'', in French], cf.

They are animals for riding, suitable for ''razzias'' ([[Raid (military)|military raids]]) and racing, and originate from [[Algeria]].|group=N|name="mehara"}}). In 1890 Monsignor Lavigerie established the annual Touggourt-[[Biskra]] long distance race:&lt;ref group=N name="Biskra"&gt;{{ar icon}} Biskra–Arabic: {{lang|ar|بسكرة}}&lt;/ref&gt; 220&amp;nbsp;km and a first prize of 1000 francs.&lt;ref name="FAT2004_p209"/&gt; Its continued success led, in 1934, to government regulation of gambling associated with the event: {{cquote|''From March 31, 1898, the betting rules applicable to horse racing, and amendments applicable in Algeria, will be applicable, in so far as they do not contravene existing laws, to racing involving donkeys or camels.''{{#tag:ref|Original French quote: ''Le règlement du pari mutuel concernant les courses de chevaux du 31 mars 1898 et ses modifications applicables en Algérie seront, en ce qu’ils ne sont pas contraires aux présentes dispositions, applicables aux courses d’ânes et de méhara.''|group=N|name="Jules_Carde_fr"}}|author=Governor General [[Jules Carde]]|source=circular 7262, promulgated on 30 June 1934.}}

As was the case in the northern cities, traditional sports developed significantly in the South – from an institutional point of view – between the two world wars. In 1928, the ''Union sportive et de préparation militaire de [[Laghouat]]'' (Sports and Military Training Union of Laghouat)&lt;ref group=N&gt;Created on 23 June{{Verify source|date=October 2011}}&lt;!--Which year?

Amongst the twelve members of the board of directors there were four Muslims. Military training was stopped After 1941 and the institution became the ''Union sportive de Laghouat'' (USL), (English: Athletic Union of Laghouat).&lt;ref name="FAT2004_p208"&gt;{{harvnb|Fatès|2004|p=208|ref=Fatès_2004}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Société sportive saharienne'' (SSS), (English:Saharan Sports Association) was listed in the ''Journal officiel de l'Algérie'' (Official [[Gazette]] of Algeria) on 15 November 1938. Its president was Rev. Lethielleux, a superior within the [[White Fathers]]. The association had two basketball teams, two football teams, and 40 trainees in the 10–15 age range.&lt;ref name="FAT2004_p208"/&gt;

But unforeseen problems surfaced. The association ''la Vie au Grand Air''&lt;ref group=N&gt;Established 6 December 1936.&lt;/ref&gt; in Geryville (now [[El Bayadh]]), which offered athletics, football, and basketball, had three Muslims amongst its 11 board members. But power-sharing proved problematic, and two further associations were formed in 1939: '' l'Union sportive geryvilloise'' (Geryville Athletic Union) led by the Agha Si Larbi Ben Din, head of the [[Zawiya (institution)|zaouïa]] of the Oualed Sidi Cheikh and Knight of the [[Legion of Honor]], and the ''Étoile du sud''{{#tag:ref|In English: Star of the South.|group=N|name="Star"}} under the leadership of the White Fathers. Legislation introduced by the [[Vichy regime]], however, led to the dissolution of these associations on 1 March 1941, and the re-establishment of a single association: the ''Stade Gérivyllois'' (Gerivylle Stadium), with the superior of the White Fathers continuing as vice-president.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fatès|2004|pp=207–208|ref=Fatès_2004}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the efforts of the White Fathers and the military, the [[Sahrawi people|sahrawi]] people of the South also began participating in organised sport, even though it had been established primarily for Europeans in the northern cities.&lt;ref name="FAT2004_p209"/&gt; The settled population gained access to participation sports – mainly football – and the official authorities properly organised and managed the traditional physical pursuits of the nomadic Bedouin.

[[File:Chiba Zoological Park, Main Gate.jpg|thumb|Chiba Zoological Park Main Gate]]

== Overview ==
The Chiba Zoological Park opened its doors for the first time in April 1985, and now includes seven different areas.

=== Zoological Hall  ===
Easy to access from the main gate, usually the first one to be visited by tourists. This area hosts the pavillon houses where the information desk is located. The Zoological Hall focuses on various species from the tropical rainforest such as nocturnal animals, marmosets, tropical birds and the most famous one of the area: the two-toed sloth.

=== The small animals zone  ===
Home of the zoo mascotte, Futa the [[red panda]] that became a TV celebrity in 2005.
This area also hosts other red pandas called Chichi, Meimei, Meita, Kuta, Mai, Mii and Genta.

=== Steppe Zone ===
In this area are hosted big herbivores such as  elephants, giraffes and zebras as well as South African cranes, ostrichs and meerkats.

=== Children's Zoo ===
This area has been designated to stimulate visitor's interest in wildlife by getting in direct contact with animals such as goat and sheep.
This area also hosts horses, capybara, penguins from Peru and Chile.
In this area an explanation of the zookeeper routine also allows the visitors to get a good understanding of what it takes to take care of the animals in the Park.

=== Monkey Zone ===
As indicated by the name, this area is essentially focused on primates such as lemurs and mandrills, as well as several other species.

=== Ancestors of Domestic Animals Zone ===
In this area, animals such as bisons are hosted and depending on the seasons there can be different ones present (such as reindeers during Christmas time).

=== Avian an Aquatic Zone ===
The Sea lions are the main attraction of this area, but other interesting species such as the Shoe-billed Stork are present and attracting a lot of visitors.

'''Chinatown Fair Family Fun Center''' is a [[video arcade]] center located on [[Mott Street]] in [[Chinatown, Manhattan]]. Historically, the arcade catered toward competitive [[fighting game]]s. The original arcade opened in 1944 and closed in February 2011, but reopened in May 2012 under different management. Chinatown Fair has been widely regarded as [[New York City]]'s "last great arcade".&lt;ref name="moth_TheO"&gt;{{Cite web| title = The Odd History And Uncertain Future Of Chinatown Fair, NYC's Last Great Arcade| author = Kopfstein, Janus| work = Vice Motherboard| date = 2011-02-23| accessdate = 2016-07-26| url = https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/9aaq37/the-future-of-nyc-s-most-famous-arcade}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nyti_ChinG"&gt;{{Cite web| title = Chinatown Fair’s Closing Leaves Gamers Bereft| author = Kaminer, Ariel| work = The New York Times| date = 2011-03-11| accessdate = 2016-07-26| url = https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/13/nyregion/13critic.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ny.c_Manh"&gt;{{Cite web| title = Manhattan's Last Coin-Operated Arcade Memorialized In New Documentary| last = Rosenberg | first = Zoe| work = [[Curbed]] | date = 2015-11-13| accessdate = 2016-07-26| url = http://ny.curbed.com/2015/11/13/9900706/manhattans-last-coin-operated-arcade-memorialized-in-new-documentary}}&lt;/ref&gt;
== History ==
Chinatown Fair opened in 1944, taking over the first floor of the popular Port Arthur Chinese Restaurant building located at 7-9 Mott Street in New York City; previously, the first floor had been occupied by Soy Kee &amp; Co., exporters, as well as the Eastern Trading Company.&lt;ref name="VoicesOfNY"&gt;{{Cite web| title = A Stretch of Mott Street, Remembered| author = Lin, Jing| work = Voices of NY| date = 2014-09-08| accessdate = 2016-08-06| url = https://voicesofny.org/2014/09/stretch-mott-street-remembered/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ChinaRhyming"&gt;{{Cite web| title = The Port Arthur Restaurant, Mott Street, New York City| author = French, Paul| work = China Rhyming| date = 2012-11-20| accessdate = 2016-08-06| url = http://www.chinarhyming.com/2012/11/20/the-port-arthur-restaurant-mott-street-new-york-city/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chinatown Fair operated as a penny arcade and small museum for many years, before becoming a video game arcade in the 1970s.&lt;ref name="Bedford"&gt;{{Cite web| title = Cut Class and Catch This Documentary About Chinatown Fair Arcade| author = Maurer, Daniel| work = Bedford and Bowery| date = 2015-11-18| accessdate = 2016-08-06| url = http://bedfordandbowery.com/2015/11/cut-class-and-catch-this-documentary-about-chinatown-fair-arcade/}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Indian people|Indian]] immigrant Sam Palmer purchased the business in 1982 after having a "religious vision".&lt;ref name="goth_Vide"&gt;{{Cite web| title = Video: Revisit The Old Days Of Chinatown Fair In This New Documentary| author = Carlson, Jen| work = Gothamist| date = 2015-11-13| accessdate = 2016-07-26| url = http://gothamist.com/2015/11/13/chinatown_fair.php| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160601002535/http://gothamist.com/2015/11/13/chinatown_fair.php| archivedate = 2016-06-01| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of its first attractions was a dancing chicken. The dancing chicken was later replaced with a [[tic-tac-toe]] playing chicken, which was retired in the early 2000s.&lt;ref name="nyti_Chin"&gt;{{Cite web| title = Chinatown Fair Returns, but Without Chicken Playing Tick-Tack-Toe| last = Gregory | first = Kia| work = The New York Times| date = 10 June 2012| accessdate = 2016-07-26| url = https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/11/nyregion/chinatown-fair-returns-but-without-chicken-playing-tick-tack-toe.html?_r=0}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1970s and 1980s, the arcade hosted many retro generation games including ''[[Pac-Man]]'' and ''[[Space Invaders]]''. In 1991, after the release of ''[[Street Fighter II: The World Warrior]]'', Chinatown Fair switched focus to competitive fighting games. By the late 1990s ''Street Fighter'', ''[[Marvel vs. Capcom]]'', ''[[The King of Fighters]]'', ''[[Soulcalibur (video game)|Soulcalibur]]'', ''[[Tekken]]'' and other fighting games were commonly played. Top players such as [[Justin Wong]], [[NYChrisG]], Michael "Yipes" Mendoza, and Sanford Kelly frequented the establishment.&lt;ref name="nyti_AnAr"&gt;{{Cite web| title = An Arcade Offers Face-to-Face Fighting in the Age of Online Gaming| last = Chibber | first = Kabir| work = The New York Times| date = 4 August 2010| accessdate = 2016-07-26| url = https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/05/fashion/05Chinatown.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2010, ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote that Chinatown Fair was among the last video arcades in the city. Video arcades have been in decline with the rise of home video games. The newspaper reported that it became "a center for all the outcasts in the city to bond over their shared love" of classic arcade and fighting video games no longer popular in modern arcades, with titles including the original ''[[Street Fighter 2]]'' (1991), ''[[King of Fighters]]'' (1996), and ''[[Ms. Pac-Man]]''. Other groups congregated around ''[[Dance Dance Revolution]]'' machines and racing games. Unlike the norm at other arcades, where winning players continue until deposed, Chinatown Fair players play a maximum of three or four continuous games.&lt;ref name="nyti_AnAr"/&gt;{{better source|reason=Was this the intended meaning from the interviewee?|date=June 2017}}

In February 2011, Chinatown Fair closed down. On May 5, 2012 over a year later it reopened under a new name "Chinatown Fair Family Fun Center" with new manager and part owner, Lonnie Sobel.&lt;ref name="goth_Vide"/&gt; Former competitive players criticized the new arcade for catering toward casual players, with the new ownership explaining that they were targeting a new clientele.&lt;ref name="thev_NewY"&gt;{{Cite web| title = New York's Chinatown Fair arcade reopens, but the game has changed| last = Kopfstein | first = Janus | work = The Verge| date = 2012-05-07| accessdate = 2016-07-26| url = https://www.theverge.com/2012/5/7/3004259/chinatown-fair-arcade-grand-re-opening}}&lt;/ref&gt; Competitive fighting game players relocated to [[Next Level (arcade)|Next Level]], a [[Brooklyn]] arcade, which opened in 2011.&lt;ref name="goth_Chin"&gt;{{Cite web| title = Chinatown Fair Resurfaces in Brooklyn As Next Level Arcade| author = Jaya Saxena| work = Gothamist| date = 2011-03-07| accessdate = 2016-07-27| url = http://gothamist.com/2011/03/07/chinatown_fair_resurfaces_as_next_l.php| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160520071123/http://gothamist.com/2011/03/07/chinatown_fair_resurfaces_as_next_l.php| archivedate = 2016-05-20| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The arcade is the focus of the 2015 documentary, ''[[The Lost Arcade]]'', which was released in [[New York City]] on August 12, 2016.&lt;ref name="city_When"&gt;{{Cite web| title = When Video Game Arcades Were Community Centers| author = Jessica Leigh Hester| work = CityLab| date = 2016-07-21| accessdate = 2016-07-26| url = http://www.citylab.com/navigator/2016/07/video-game-arcade-chinatown-fair-documentary/492059/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''cinema of Armenia''' was born on April 16, 1923, when the Armenian State Committee of Cinema was established by government decree.

The first Armenian film with Armenian subject called "Haykakan Sinema" was produced in 1912 in Cairo by Armenian-Egyptian publisher Vahan Zartarian. The film was premiered in Cairo on March 13, 1913.&lt;ref&gt;Armenian Cinema 100, by [[Artsvi Bakhchinyan]], Yerevan, 2012, pp. 111-112&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1924, the first [[Armenia]]n film studio: ''[[Armenfilm]]'' ({{lang-hy|Հայֆիլմ}} "Hayfilm," {{lang-ru|Арменкино}} "Armenkino") was established in [[Yerevan]], starting with ''Soviet Armenia'' (1924), an Armenian [[documentary film]].

''[[Namus (film)|Namus]]'' was the first Armenian [[silent film|silent]] [[black-and-white]] film (1925), directed by [[Hamo Beknazarian]] and based on a play of [[Alexander Shirvanzade]] describing the ill fate of two lovers, who were engaged by their families to each other since childhood, but because of violations of ''[[namus]]'' (a tradition of honor), the girl was married by her father to another person. The first [[sound film]], ''[[Pepo (film)|Pepo]]'' was shot in 1935, director [[Hamo Beknazarian]]. 

More recent directors include: 
* [[Sergei Parajanov]] (best known for ''[[The Color of Pomegranates]]'')
* [[Henrik Malyan]] (Best known for Nahapet)
* [[Artavazd Peleshian]] (best known for ''The Seasons of the Year'')
* [[Hamo Beknazarian]]
* [[Edmond Keosayan]]
* [[Frunze Dovlatyan]]
* [[Mikhail Vartanov]] (best known for ''[[Parajanov: The Last Spring]]'')
* [[Levon Mkrtchyan]] (Hovhannes Shiraz)
* [[Atom Egoyan]] Ararat
* [[J. Michael Hagopian]], for his acclaimed documentaries on the [[Armenian Genocide]], modern Armenian history, and historical Armenia

Modern day Armenian cinema produces two or three features, eight shorts and fifteen documentary films each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=International Film Guide 2012 |first=Ian Hayden |last=Smith |year= 2012 |isbn= 978-1908215017 |page= 60 }}&lt;!--|accessdate= 5 April 2012--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

{{For|the Joint Committee of Fifteen|United States Congress Joint Committee on Reconstruction}}
The '''Committee of Fifteen''' was a [[New York City]] citizens' group that lobbied for the elimination of [[prostitution]] and [[gambling]]. It was established in November 1900. The Committee hired investigators who visited city locations where [[prostitution]] and [[gambling]] was alleged to have taken place and filed reports on each site. The investigators visited bars, [[pool hall]]s, [[dance hall]]s, and tenements during the year 1901. The investigators posed as clients to determine the locations where prostitution took place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=The Social Evil in Tenement Houses.

The Committee disbanded in 1901 after evaluating the investigations and reporting to Governor [[Benjamin Barker Odell, Jr.]] It was succeeded by the [[Committee of Fourteen]].

In the '''United Kingdom, [[continuity announcer]]s''' are people who are employed to introduce programmes on radio and television networks, to promote forthcoming programmes on the station, to cross-promote programmes on the broadcaster's other stations where applicable and, sometimes, to provide information relating to the programme just broadcast.

The six pre-digital terrestrial television channels in the UK ([[BBC One]], [[BBC Two]], [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]], [[Channel 4]], [[S4C]] and [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]]) make use of continuity announcers, and for most of the time, continuity announcements are presented live. Continuity announcers can also be found on digital and satellite channels, but most of these channels make use of pre-recorded announcements.

==BBC==
The [[BBC]] mainly uses live announcers on its flagship television channels BBC One and BBC Two, and mainly uses pre-recorded announcements on its digital channels (apart from [[BBC News (TV channel)|BBC News]] and [[BBC Parliament]], which do not use announcers at all). Separate continuity for BBC One and BBC Two in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland is provided by regional announcers who also double as transmission directors. BBC Wales announcers also direct [[Wales Today]] news bulletins during breakfast, mid-afternoon and late night.

Presently, the only national radio station to use continuity announcers is [[BBC Radio 4]], where many of the announcing staff also act as newsreaders and also introduce the station's [[Shipping Forecast]]. Until about 1990, [[BBC Radio 2]] used continuity announcers (separate from newsreaders) for its weekend and evening output, but these have since disappeared. Similarly, [[BBC Radio 3]] has downgraded the former role of its announcers in favour of a new style of presenter. Continuity announcers played a much heavier role on the pre-1967 [[BBC Home Service]], [[BBC Light Programme]] and [[BBC Third Programme]] (and other services on the last-named's frequency). Announcing staff for [[BBC Radio Cymru]], [[BBC Radio Scotland]], [[BBC Radio Ulster]] and [[BBC Radio Wales]] double as newsreaders and technical operators.

Continuity announcements for BBC television channels are broadcast from [[Red Bee Media]] at the White City Media Village in West London, with regional continuity teams based in the regional broadcasting centres in Belfast, Cardiff and Glasgow providing links for the regional variations of BBC One and BBC Two. [[CBBC]] and [[CBeebies]] continuity now airs from studios at [[MediaCityUK]] in [[Salford Quays]]&amp;nbsp;– up until September 2011, CBBC presentation was broadcast from a small studio in the East Tower of [[BBC Television Centre]] while [[CBeebies]] presentation was pre-recorded at [[Teddington Studios]]. The announcing team for BBC Radio 4 work from a suite of studios on the 7th floor of [[Broadcasting House]] in London.

Historically, BBC announcers mostly spoke with [[Received Pronunciation]], but the range of accents heard has widened considerably in recent years, and the general tone has become more informal.

===In-vision continuity===

====Early continuity====
Andrew Martin, an expert from the BBC archives, described continuity announcements as "an essential part of television," which "actually tell us quite a lot about the style, the kind of attitudes of television in their particular era."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/archive/bitsinbetween.shtml?chapter=1  Andrew Martin – The bits in between...] at the BBC archive.&lt;/ref&gt;

In-vision continuity announcers, who appeared on screen between programmes, were a staple part of television broadcasts from the very earliest days of television, because "there was a need for linking material between programmes just to kind of announce them." In the early days of television, it was almost like a variety bill in the theatre... [and when] an item would come on, somebody had to say what it was often listing an entire evening's up-coming programming in one link.&lt;ref name="MartinAnn"&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/archive/bitsinbetween.shtml?chapter=2 Andrew Martin – The bits in between...: "Announcers"] at the BBC archive.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MartinAnn"/&gt;

The early announcers became "celebrities in their own right," often receiving considerable amounts of [[fan mail]], as they were among the most recognisable on-screen individuals, appearing every day, at the start of an era when television celebrity was really invented. Early in-vision announcers included [[Jasmine Bligh]], [[Elizabeth Cowell]] and [[Leslie Mitchell (broadcaster)|Leslie Mitchell]], formerly a [[newsreel]] announcer who famously re-opened the television service in 1946. The early continuity announcers were auditioned, as "they had to look good but they also had to speak well", not solely because of the class divide, but because clear speaking was crucial to their role.&lt;ref name="MartinAnn"/&gt;

====Later continuity====
It is believed that in-vision continuity was last used during the peak viewing hours on BBC TV in the early 1960s, with a link into the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1963]] the last-known example of the corporation's use of in-vision continuity (as well as existing out-of-vision continuity) across the national network.

Between the late 1960s and circa 1980, many of the BBC's English regions provided their own continuity on weekday evenings, including in-vision presentation&amp;nbsp;– particularly at closedown. Regional in-vision continuity was still used by BBC South in [[Southampton]], BBC Midlands in [[Birmingham]] and BBC North West in [[Manchester]] by the time English regional continuity was phased out. From 1998 to 2001, the [[Northern Ireland]] regional service on [[BBC Three|BBC Choice]] used in-vision continuity links.

====Children's continuity====
The presentation of children's programmes had in-vision continuity from its instigation until 1965. The best-known children's in-vision continuity face was that of schoolgirl [[Jennifer Gay]], one of the [[Children's Hour]] announcers, who introduced such favourites as [[Muffin the Mule]] between 1949 and 1953.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/archive/bitsinbetween.shtml?chapter=4 Andrew Martin &amp; Jennifer Gay – The bits in between...: "Children's announcers"] at the BBC archive.&lt;/ref&gt;

In-vision continuity was re-introduced as part of Children's BBC/[[CBBC]]) on 9 September 1985. From then until 1994, this came from the main BBC1 continuity suite itself, referred to as "the broom cupboard" and introduced by various presenters including [[Andy Crane]], [[Andi Peters]] and [[Phillip Schofield]]; Since then, it has come from larger, specialised studios. As of September 2011, presentation for both CBBC and [[CBeebies]] originates from the BBC's [[MediaCityUK]] studios in Salford Quays, following the BBC Children's department move from London.

====Modern continuity====
In February 2008, BBC Three introduced in-vision continuity links, in the form of live links with presenter Jose Vanders and recorded links with BBC Three viewers. For a time, the BBC Three website offered viewers the opportunity to record links for programmes. The live in-vision links were dropped after only a few months although live out-of-vision continuity during peak time returned in September 2011.

On 19 September 2008, the Scottish Gaelic-language digital channel [[BBC Alba]] launched with in-vision continuity from the channel's sole announcer, Fiona MacKenzie. A second in-vision announcer, Moira MacDonald, was appointed in July 2009. All continuity links are pre-recorded in Stornoway and transmitted from BBC Scotland's headquarters in [[Glasgow]].

==ITV==
All announcements for [[ITV plc]]-owned stations on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]], [[UTV (TV channel)|UTV]] and [[Channel Television]], and for [[ITV2]], [[ITV3]] and [[ITV4]] come from the company's main transmission facilities at Technicolor in [[Chiswick]], with separate teams of continuity announcers based at the separately-owned [[STV (TV network)|STV]]'s headquarters in [[Pacific Quay]], Glasgow.

Most announcements broadcast on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] are conducted live, while overnight announcements, regional continuity on UTV and continuity for ITV2, ITV3 and ITV4 are usually pre-recorded, along with regional continuity. All of ITV plc's announcers work on a [[freelancer|freelance]] basis.

STV uses live continuity during the evening (between around 5&amp;nbsp;pm and midnight) with daytime announcements pre-recorded by the duty prime time announcer during their shift. STV-branded presentation is used throughout the station's broadcast hours with transmission manned by technical staff in Glasgow 24 hours a day.

The consolidation of ITV companies during the 1990s and 2000s led to the closure of transmission and continuity facilities at some ITV company studios:

===In-vision continuity===
The use of on screen continuity announcers was common on ITV when each region was run by an independent company with their own transmission and continuity facilities. During the 1980s and 1990s, many regional companies abandoned the use of in-vision continuity announcers:

The only ITV companies which have never used in-vision continuity are [[Carlton Television]] (London) and [[Westcountry Television]], who both began broadcasting on 1 January 1993. Granada Television, for its first 20 years or so, never used in-vision continuity as its CEO, [[Sidney Bernstein, Baron Bernstein|Sidney Bernstein]], considered it frivolous for a station that was trying to match the BBC in image and respectability (despite the BBC employing in-vision announcers at the time of Granada's launch) and felt that having a mere functionary like a continuity announcer appear in-vision would cheapen the station. This decision was reversed in the late 1970s, soon after Sidney Bernstein retired.

==Channel 4==
Channel 4 employs continuity announcers on its network of stations; [[4seven]], [[Channel 4]], [[E4 (channel)|E4]], [[Film4]] and [[More4]]. All announcements come from Red Bee Media at White City Media Village in West London. Since 2009, Red Bee have provided playout facilities for Channel 4. On 4seven, E4 and More4, announcements during evening primetime are now commonly broadcast live, with recorded announcements at other times; most announcements on Channel 4 are live. Announcements for [[4Music]] programming, where used, are usually pre-recorded.

===In-vision continuity===
Channel 4 used links featuring the announcer on-screen for a brief period following its launch in 1982, mainly at closedown. The station briefly reprised the use of in-vision continuity links for a short period from 1996, used mainly in evening transmissions.

==S4C==
[[S4C]] announcers provide live out-of-vision continuity links from the channel's headquarters in Llanishen, Cardiff.

===In-vision continuity===
S4C used in-vision continuity throughout broadcast hours from launch in November 1982 until around 1991.

In-vision presentation continues to be used during S4C's children strands, [[Cyw]] (for young children) and '''Stwnsh''' (for older children). '''Stwnsh''' links are mostly conducted live whereas '''Cyw''' links are mostly pre-recorded. Characters and presenters from S4C's '''Cyw''' output occasionally appear as guest announcers.

Children's presentation is produced by independent production companies Boomerang ('''Stwnsh'''/'''Cyw''' in-vision links) and '''Cwmni Da''' ('''Cyw''').

==Channel 5==
Channel 5 use announcers on its network of stations; [[5*]], [[5USA]] and [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]]. All announcements come from Channel 5's transmission facility in London.

===In-vision continuity===
Channel 5 has only used on-screen announcers as part of its children's strand, [[Milkshake!]] which comes from studios at Hawley Crescent, London.

==Sky1==
[[Sky1]] out-of-vision continuity is broadcast live in the evening with pre-recorded links broadcast during the day and overnight.

==Sky Living==
[[Sky Living]] out-of-vision continuity is live, as of January 2016.

==Sky Movies==
[[Sky Movies]] out-of-vision continuity is live, since January 2016.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5747">''De Bérangier au lonc cul'' is a [[Medieval French literature|medieval French]] [[fabliau]]. There are two versions of the fabliau: one by Guerin and one anonymous. In summary, the story begins when a rich earl marries his daughter off to a "young [[peasant]]" and deems him a [[knight]]. The knight abandons the code of [[chivalry]] and lazes around for the first ten years of the marriage. When his wife, tired of his demeaning attitude and lazy nature, speaks of the greatness of the knights in her family, the husband decides to prove himself a worthy knight. He dresses in armor and goes into the forest on horseback. Once in the forest, he hangs his shield on the lowest branch of a tree and beats it until it looks as if it endured a great battle. The knight returns to his wife, shows her his bruised [[armor]], and gloats about his victories. After a few trips into the forest, the wife begins to wonder why the knight himself is unscathed while his armor is in shambles. The next day, she suggests he take servants with him. When he refuses, the lady dresses in a full body suit of armor and follows him into the forest. When she sees him beating his own shield, she steps into sight and threatens to kill him for his dishonor to chivalry. The knight does not recognize his wife's voice. He begs for "pity" and offers to do anything to avoid conflict. His wife, disguised as a mighty knight, gives him the option of [[jousting]] her, in which he will surely die, or kissing her arse.  Out of [[cowardice]], the knight chooses to kiss her arse. She hops off her horse and pulls down her pants. While the knight should have recognized her female [[genitalia]], he remarks that she has a long arse. Before she leaves, she tells him, "I'm Bérangier of the Long Ass, Who puts shame to the chickenhearted." The wife returns home and sleeps with a valiant knight. When her husband arrives from the forest, he rebukes her. However, that was his last demeaning remark to her. She tells him she met Bérangier and learned of her husband's cowardice. To protect his own name, the knight is forced to succumb to his wife's wishes. Her cleverness leads her to do as she pleased for the rest of her life, and her husband lives in shame.&lt;ref&gt;Eichmann, Raymond. Cuckolds, Clerics, &amp; Countrymen: Medieval French Fabliaux. 
Fayetteville: The University of Arkansas Press, 1982. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gender Morals in Bérangier==
The husband's initial [[antagonist]]ic behavior cues the gender moral of the story: constantly demeaning a clever wife can be dangerous.&lt;ref&gt;Crocker, Holly. Comic Provocations. New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2006. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; In order to find out her husband, the wife disguises herself as a knight who she calls “Berangier au lonc cul” [Bernagier of the long ass]. She follows her husband into the forest, and, upon seeing his foolish actions, “the roles are reversed”.&lt;ref&gt;Eichmann, Raymond. Cuckolds, Clerics, &amp; Countrymen: Medieval French Fabliaux. 
Fayetteville: The University of Arkansas Press, 1982. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas the woman previously had “[caught] the brunt of [her husband’s] bragging and insults,” seeing the “absolute [[farce]]” of his claims in the forest inspires her to become a “hard, driving force that will not only teach him a lesson but also will annihilate him in position as leader in the household”.&lt;ref&gt;Eichmann, Raymond. Cuckolds, Clerics, &amp; Countrymen: Medieval French Fabliaux. Fayetteville: The University of Arkansas Press, 1982. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Upon the encounter with his wife, disguised as a valiant knight, the husband automatically reveals his cowardice and, out of terror, begs for mercy. His wife gives him an ultimatum: he can “jostez” [joust] and surely die or “vos me venroiz el cul baisier” [kiss her ass].&lt;ref&gt;ichmann, Raymond. Cuckolds, Clerics, &amp; Countrymen: Medieval French Fabliaux. Fayetteville: The University of Arkansas Press, 1982. Print.
&lt;/ref&gt; Without realizing the gravity of his decision, he yields the power in his marriage to his wife, reversing his position of power, when he refuses to fight the knight. In addition, he displays ignorance when he does not recognize her genitals; he merely thought the knight had “au lonc cul” [a long ass]. In an exploitation of his ignorant failure to recognize her female genitals,&lt;ref&gt;Gaunt, Simon. Gender and Genre in medieval French Literature. New York: Press Syndicate of the University of Cambridge, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; the wife and the audience share pleasure in the fact she has duped her husband and the fact he will never know.&lt;ref&gt;Crocker, Holly. Comic Provocations. New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2006. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The story “draw[s] a conventional lesson about proper gender roles in marriage,” &lt;ref&gt;Crocker, Holly. Comic Provocations. New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2006. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; which suggests the demeaning of a wife by a husband is not “proper.” Thus, the reversal of the gender roles in this story creates the gender moral.

In [[music]], the '''dynamics''' of a piece is the variation in [[loudness]] between [[note (music)|notes]] or [[phrase (music)|phrases]]. Dynamics are indicated by specific [[musical notation]], often in some detail. However, dynamics markings still require interpretation by the performer depending on the musical context: for instance a ''piano'' (quiet) marking in one part of a piece might have quite different objective loudness in another piece, or even a different section of the same piece. The execution of dynamics also extends beyond loudness to include changes in [[timbre]] and sometimes [[tempo rubato]].
==Purpose and interpretation==
Dynamics are one of the [[musical expression|expressive elements of music]]. Used effectively, dynamics help musicians sustain variety and interest in a musical performance, and communicate a particular emotional state or feeling.

Dynamic markings are always relative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Thiemel|first1=Matthias|title=Dynamics|url=http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/08458|website=Grove Music Online (subscriber only access)|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=7 July 2017|ref=Grove Dynamics}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{serif|'''''p'''''}} never indicates a precise level of [[loudness]], it merely indicates that music in a passage so marked should be considerably quieter than {{serif|'''''f'''''}}. There are many factors affecting the interpretation of a dynamic marking. For instance, the middle of a [[phrase (music theory)|musical phrase]] will normally be played louder than the beginning or ending, to ensure the phrase is properly shaped, even where a passage is marked {{serif|'''''p'''''}} throughout.  Similarly, in [[polyphony|multi-part music]], some [[part (music)|voices]] will naturally be played louder than others, for instance to emphasis the melody and the bass line, even if a whole passage is marked at one dynamic level. Some instruments are naturally louder than others - for instance, a [[tuba]] playing ''piano'' will likely be louder than a [[guitar]] playing ''fortissimo'', while a high-pitched instrument like the [[piccolo]] playing in its upper register can usually sound loud even when its actual decibel level is lower than that of other instruments.

Further, a dynamic marking does not necessarily only affect loudness of the music. A ''forte'' passage is not usually "the same as a ''piano'' passage but louder". Rather, a musician will often use a different approach to other aspects of expression like [[timbre]] or [[Articulation (music)|articulation]] to further illustrate the differences. Sometimes this might also extend to [[tempo]]. It's important for a performer to be able to control dynamics and tempo independently, and thus novice musicians are often instructed "don't speed up just because it's getting louder!". However, in some circumstances, a dynamic marking might also indicate a change of tempo.{{efn|For instance, in Schubert's string quartet ''[[Death and the Maiden Quartet|Death and the Maiden]]'', the ''dimenuendo'' marking is followed by ''[[a tempo]]'', indicating that the dimenuendo is a reduction in speed as well as in loudness. In the same work Schubert uses ''decrescendo'' to indicate a reduction in loudness with no change in speed.}}

In some [[scorewriter|music notation program]]s, there are default [[Musical Instrument Digital Interface|MIDI]] key velocity values associated with these indications, but more sophisticated programs allow users to change these as needed. Apple's [[Logic Pro]] 9 (2009-2013) and Avid's [[Sibelius (software)|Sibelius]] 5 (2007-2009) use the following values: Sibelius 5 defines the following values, though these may be adjusted in Sibelius, within the range 0-127:

The two basic dynamic indications in music are:

More subtle degrees of loudness or softness are indicated by:
* {{serif|'''''mp'''''}}, standing for ''mezzo-piano'',  meaning "half soft".
* {{serif|'''''mf'''''}}, standing for ''mezzo-forte'',  meaning "half loud".&lt;ref name="vtd"&gt;{{cite web | title=Dynamics  | work=Virginia Tech Multimedia Music Dictionary | url=http://www.music.vt.edu/musicdictionary/textd/Dynamics.html  | accessdate=2012-03-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''{{serif|più '''p'''}}'', standing for ''più piano'' and meaning "softer".
* ''{{serif|più '''f'''}}'', standing for ''più forte'' and meaning "louder".

Use of up to three consecutive {{serif|'''''f'''''}}s or {{serif|'''''p'''''}}s is also common:

{{anchor|Abrupt changes|Gradual changes}}
{{redirect-multi|2|Crescendo|Diminuendo}}

[[Image:Dynamic's Note Velocity.svg|thumb|350px|Note Velocity is a [[MIDI]] measurement of the speed that the key travels from its rest position to completely depressed, with 127, the largest value in a 7-bit number, being instantaneous, and meaning as strong as possible. {{audio|MIDI dynamics fff to ppp.mid|Play a C major chord at each dynamic from fff to ppp}}]]

Three Italian words are used to show gradual changes in volume:

* '''''crescendo''''' (abbreviated ''{{serif|cresc.}}'') translates as "increasing" (literally "growing").
* '''''decrescendo''''' (abbreviated to ''{{serif|decresc.}}'') translates as "decreasing".
* '''''diminuendo''''' (abbreviated ''{{serif|dim.}}'') translates as "diminishing".

Signs sometimes referred to as "[[hairpin]]s"&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, Michael and Bourne, Joyce: ''The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Music'' (1996), entry "Hairpins".&lt;/ref&gt; are also used to stand for these words (See image). If the angle lines open up ([[File:Music-crescendo.svg|15x15px]]), then the indication is to get louder; if they close gradually ([[File:Music-diminuendo.svg|15x15px]]), the indication is to get softer. The following notation indicates music starting moderately strong, then becoming gradually stronger and then gradually quieter:

:&lt;score lang="lilypond"&gt;
    \relative c'' {
        \time 4/4
        \override DynamicLineSpanner.staff-padding = #2.5
        a4._\mf\&lt; gis16 a\! c4.\&gt; b8\! a4
    }
&lt;/score&gt;

Hairpins are usually written below the [[staff (music)|staff]] (or between the two staves in a [[grand staff]]), but are sometimes found above, especially in music for [[singer]]s or in music with multiple melody lines being played by a single performer. They tend to be used for dynamic changes over a relatively short space of time (at most a few [[bar (music)|bars]]), while ''{{serif|cresc.}}'', ''{{serif|decresc.}}'' and ''{{serif|dim.}}'' are generally used for changes over a longer period. Word directions can be extended with dashes to indicate over what time the event should occur, which may be as long as multiple pages. The word ''morendo'' ("dying") is also sometimes used for a gradual reduction in dynamics (and tempo).

For greater changes in dynamics, ''{{serif|cresc. molto}}'' and ''{{serif|dim. molto}}'' are often used, where the ''molto'' means "much". Similarly, for more gradual changes ''{{serif|poco cresc.}}'' and ''{{serif|poco dim.}}'' are used, where "poco" translates as ''a little'', or alternatively with ''poco a poco'' meaning "little by little''.

Sudden changes in dynamics may be notated by adding the word ''subito'' (meaning "suddenly") as a prefix or suffix to the new dynamic notation. ''Subito piano (''abbreviated ''{{serif| sub. '''p'''}}'') ("suddenly soft") indicates that the dynamics quickly, almost abruptly, lower the volume to approximately the {{serif|'''''p'''''}} range. It is often purposefully used to subvert the listeners expectation and will signify an intimacy expression. Although it uses the ''piano'' {{serif|'''''p'''''}} dynamic symbol, the performer has slight freedom in their interpretation, causing it to vary based on the preceding loudness or character of the piece.

{{anchor|Sudden_changes_and_accented_notes}}
[[Accent (music)|Accented notes]] can be notated  ''sforzando'', ''sforzato'', ''forzando'' or ''forzato'' (abbreviated {{serif|'''''sfz'''''}}, {{serif|'''''sf'''''}}, or {{serif|'''''fz'''''}}) ("forcing" or "forced"), or using the sign '''&gt;''', placed above or below the head of the note.

''Sforzando'' (or ''sforzato'', ''forzando'', ''forzato'') indicates a forceful accent and is abbreviated as {{serif|'''''sf'''''}}, {{serif|'''''sfz'''''}} or {{serif|'''''fz'''''}}. There is often confusion surrounding these markings and whether or not there is any difference in the degree of accent. However, all of these indicate the same expression, depending on the dynamic level,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Gerou |first=Tom |first2=Linda |last2= Lusk |title= Essential Dictionary of Music Notation: The Most Practical and Concise Source for Music Notation |year=1996 |publisher=Alfred Music Publishing |location= Van Nuys, CA |isbn= 978-0882847306 |pages=37–38 |url= https://books.google.com/?id=6PELtxxrz_QC&amp;pg=PA38&amp;dq=sf+sfz+fz#v=onepage&amp;q=sf%20sfz%20fz&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the extent of the ''sforzando'' is determined purely by the performer.

The [[fortepiano (musical dynamic)|fortepiano]] notation {{serif|'''''fp'''''}} indicates a ''forte'' followed immediately by ''piano''. By contrast, {{serif|'''''pf'''''}} is an abbreviation for ''poco forte'', literally "a little loud" but (according to Brahms) meaning ''with the character of forte, but the sound of piano'', though rarely used because of possible confusion with ''[[#Words and phrases indicating changes of dynamics|pianoforte]]'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jeffreysolow.com/Writings/AnEnigmaticMarkingExplainedVcS.doc An Enigmatic Marking Explained], by Jeffrey Solow, Violoncello Society Newsletter, Spring 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

While the typical range of dynamic  markings is from {{serif|'''''ppp'''''}} to {{serif|'''''fff'''''}}, some pieces use additional markings of further emphasis. Extreme dynamic markings imply an extreme range of loudness, or, alternatively, imply an extremely subtle distinction between very small differences of loudness within a normal range. This kind of usage is most common in orchestral works from the late 19th-century onwards. Generally, these markings are supported by the [[orchestration]] of the work, with heavy forte markings brought to life by having many loud instruments like brass and percussion playing at once.

In [[Gustav Holst|Holst]]'s ''[[The Planets]]'', {{serif|'''''ffff'''''}} occurs twice in "Mars" and once in "Uranus", often punctuated by organ.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://ks.imslp.info/files/imglnks/usimg/5/59/IMSLP05396-Holst_-_THE_PLANETS_-_Suite_for_Large_Orchestra_-_Partitur.pdf|title=The Planets|last=Holst|first=Gustav|publisher=Goodwin &amp; Tabb|year=1921|isbn=|location=London|pages=29, 42, 159|access-date=25 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]] marks a bassoon solo {{serif|'''''pppppp'''''}} (6 {{serif|'''''p'''''}}s) in his [[Symphony No. 6 (Tchaikovsky)|''Pathétique'' Symphony]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://ks.imslp.info/files/imglnks/usimg/b/b5/IMSLP504312-PMLP2511-Tchaikovsky_-_Symphony_No.6_in_B_minor,_Op.74;_TH_30;_CW_27,_'Pathetic'.pdf|title=Fourth, Fifth and Sixth Symphonies in Full Score|last=Tchaikovsky|first=Peter Ilyitch|publisher=Dover Publications|year=1979|isbn=048623861X|location=New York|page=First movement, just before Allegro vivo|nopp=y|oclc=6414366}}&lt;/ref&gt; and uses {{serif|'''''ffff'''''}} in passages of his ''[[1812 Overture]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://ks.imslp.info/files/imglnks/usimg/f/f1/IMSLP01078-Tchaikovsky_-_1812_Overture.pdf|title=P.I.

==History==
''On Music'', one of the ''[[Moralia]]'' attributed to the philosopher [[Plutarch]] in the first century AD, suggests that ancient Greek musical performance included dynamic transitions – though dynamics receive far less attention in the text than does [[rhythm]] or [[harmony]].

The [[renaissance music|Renaissance]] [[composer]] [[Giovanni Gabrieli]] was one of the first to indicate dynamics in [[music notation]], but dynamics were used sparingly by composers until the late 18th century. [[Johann Sebastian Bach|J.S. Bach]] used some dynamic terms, including ''forte'', ''piano'', ''più piano'', and ''pianissimo'' (although written out as full words), and in some cases it may be that {{serif|'''''ppp'''''}} was considered to mean ''pianissimo'' in this period.

The fact that the [[harpsichord]] could play only "terraced" dynamics (either loud or soft, but not in between), and the fact that composers of the period did not mark gradations of dynamics in their scores, has led to the "somewhat misleading suggestion that [[Baroque music|baroque]] dynamics are 'terraced dynamics'," writes [[Robert Donington]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Donington|Donington, Robert]]: ''Baroque Music'' (1982) WW Norton, 1982. {{ISBN|0-393-30052-8}}. Page 32.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, baroque musicians constantly varied dynamics: in 1752, [[Johann Joachim Quantz]] wrote that "Light and shade must be constantly introduced ... by the incessant interchange of loud and soft."&lt;ref&gt;Donington, Robert: ''Baroque Music'' (1982) WW Norton, 1982. {{ISBN|0-393-30052-8}}. Page 33.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to this, the [[harpsichord]] in fact becomes louder or softer depending on the thickness of the musical texture (four notes are louder than two). This allowed composers like J.S. Bach to build dynamics directly into their compositions, without the need for notation.

In the [[Romantic music|Romantic period]], composers greatly expanded the vocabulary for describing dynamic changes in their scores. Where [[Joseph Haydn|Haydn]] and [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] specified six levels ({{serif|'''''pp'''''}} to {{serif|'''''ff'''''}}), [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]] used also {{serif|'''''ppp'''''}} and {{serif|'''''fff'''''}} (the latter less frequently), and [[Johannes Brahms|Brahms]] used a range of terms to describe the dynamics he wanted. In the slow movement of Brahms's [[Horn Trio (Brahms)|trio for violin, horn and piano (Opus 40)]], he uses the expressions {{serif|'''''ppp'''''}}, ''molto piano'', and ''[[quasi niente]]'' to express different qualities of quiet. Many Romantic and later composers added ''{{serif|più '''p'''}}'' and ''{{serif|più '''f'''}}'', making for a total of ten levels between {{serif|'''''ppp'''''}} and {{serif|'''''fff'''''}}.

== Relation to audio dynamics ==
The introduction of modern recording techniques has provided alternative ways to control the dynamics of music. [[Dynamic range compression]] is used to control the [[Dynamic range#Music|dynamic range]] of a recording, or a single instrument. This can affect loudness variations, both at the micro-&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mastering Audio|last=Katz|first=Robert|publisher=|year=2002|isbn=0-240-80545-3|location=Amsterdam: Boston|pages=109}}&lt;/ref&gt; and macro scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.soundonsound.com/sound-advice/dynamic-range-loudness-war|title='Dynamic Range' &amp; The Loudness War|last=Deruty|first=Emmanuel|date=September 2011|work=Sound on Sound|access-date=2018-01-16|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many contexts, the meaning of the term ''dynamics'' is therefore not immediately clear. To distinguish between the different aspects of dynamics, the term ''performed dynamics'' can be used to refer to the aspects of music dynamics that is controlled exclusively by the performer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Elowsson|first=Anders|last2=Friberg|first2=Anders|date=|title=Predicting the perception of performed dynamics in music audio with ensemble learning|url=http://www.speech.kth.se/prod/publications/files/4106.pdf|journal=The Acoustical Society of America|volume=141 |issue=3|pages=2224–2242|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''ESPN Zone''' was a [[theme restaurant]] and entertainment center [[restaurant chain|chain]] in the United States that included [[amusement arcade|arcades]], [[TV studio]]s, and [[radio studio]]s, operated by the [[Disney Regional Entertainment]] subsidiary of [[Walt Disney Parks and Resorts]] using the [[Disney]]-owned [[ESPN]] brand. While the ESPN Zone name is no longer used, similar, still-operating restaurants include the [[ESPN Club]] at [[Disney's BoardWalk Inn]] and the [[ESPN Grill]] at [[Disney's Wide World of Sports|ESPN Wide World of Sports]], both located within the [[Walt Disney World]] complex in [[Bay Lake, FL|Bay Lake]], Florida.

==Background==
In 1992, [[Art Levitt]] conceived of an ESPN/Disney project, while he was Disney Parks and Resorts vice president of resorts and special projects, to increase [[Pleasure Island (Walt Disney World)|Disney's Pleasure Island]]'s attractions. Levitt's concept was "to put an ESPN experience in Disney World". Despite discussions with ESPN, the project was not immediately given the green light. Levitt exited Disney for the CEO post at [[Hard Rock Cafe]] International. The ESPN Club sports bar, at [[Walt Disney World]] with 13,000 square feet of TV screens, was a modest attempt that came from those discussions, and drew enough attendance as a proof of concept.&lt;ref name="bs"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1998-03-08/business/1998067025_1_sports-entertainment-espn-zone-disney-regional-entertainment/2|title=ESPN's fun zone Entertainment: The first ESPN Zone, a venture with Disney, promises to be on the cutting edge of interactive sports entertainment|date=March 8, 1998|work=Baltimore Sun|pages=1–3|language=en|last1=Arney|first1=June|accessdate=February 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The restaurant opened on July 1, 1996, at the [[Disney's BoardWalk Resort|BoardWalk]] entertainment complex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1996-06-10/business/9606061510_1_walt-disney-sports-espn-club|title=Espn Steps Up To The Plate With Sports Bar|date=June 10, 1996|work=Orlando Sentinel|publisher=Tribune Publishing|language=en|last1=Shenot|first1=Christine|accessdate=February 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar project, Sports Center USA, led by Lynda O'Dea, attempted to get started for four years in the early 1990s with its selected first location at Baltimore's [[Pratt Street Power Plant|Power Plant]]. A lack of financing ended this project that was done in conjunction with [[Capital Cities/ABC]], Inc.&lt;ref name=bs/&gt;

==History==
[[Image:EspnZoneBaltimore.JPG|thumb|right|ESPN Zone in Baltimore in 2007.]]
With Disney's purchase of [[Capital Cities/ABC]] in 1996, ESPN was a key part of the purchase, which Disney chair/CEO [[Michael Eisner]] then moved into additional brand extensions from biweekly sports magazine, ESPN-themed restaurants, video games to [[Disney Store#ESPN Store|retail stores]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1997/nov/20/business/fi-55695|title=Expansion Team|date=November 20, 1997|work=Los Angeles Times|last1=Mulligan|first1=Thomas S.|accessdate=February 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; With Levitt having the original idea in 1992, Eisner turned to him to head up [[Disney Regional Entertainment]], the subsidiary that would start up and run the chain.&lt;ref name=bs/&gt;

The concept was originally called ESPN Grill when announced in October 1997, with a slate of major city locations scheduled to start with [[Baltimore]], Maryland, in mid-1998 and Chicago in spring 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/1997/tv/news/espn-serves-up-grill-1116677873/|title=ESPN serves up Grill|date=October 15, 1997|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|last1=Richmond|first1=Ray|accessdate=February 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ESPN Grill was renamed on December 29, 1997 to ESPN Zone to connote that there was more to the venue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1997-12-30/business/1997364039_1_espn-zone-disney-regional-entertainment-sports|title=Power Plant tenant renamed as ESPN Zone|last=|first=|date=December 30, 1997|work=Baltimore Sun|language=en|accessdate=February 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first ESPN Zone opened in [[Baltimore]], Maryland, on July 11, 1998, in the [[Pratt Street Power Plant|Power Plant]] on the [[Inner Harbor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1998-07-09/business/bal-10th-espnzone_1_gratifying-features-disney-regional-entertainment-espn-cable-network|title=In the zone|date=July 9, 1998|work=Baltimore Sun|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170203080930/http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1998-07-09/business/bal-10th-espnzone_1_gratifying-features-disney-regional-entertainment-espn-cable-network|archive-date=February 3, 2017|dead-url=yes|publisher=Tribune Publishing|language=en|last1=Gunts|first1=Edward|accessdate=February 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chicago location opened on July 10, 1999 in the North Bridge development where [[DisneyQuest]], a fellow Disney Regional chain, opened a month earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Disney's double plans: Disney Regional Entertainment said...|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1999-03-04/news/9903050455_1_indoor-interactive-theme-park-disney-regional-entertainment-espn-zone|accessdate=October 23, 2017|work=Chicago Tribune|date=March 4, 1999|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the Chicago location opening, there was to be a new location every three months.&lt;ref name=bs/&gt;

===Closures===
[[File:ESPN Zone in New York (4702626143).jpg|thumb|right|ESPN Zone interior in Times Square, New York, in 2010.]]
In 2009, Disney Regional Entertainment closed two ESPN Zone locations. A restaurant in [[Denver]] closed in June,&lt;ref name="Den0629"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedenverchannel.com/news/19892138/detail.html|title=Denver's ESPN Zone Closed|first=Tyler|date=June 29, 2009|publisher=[[The E.W. Scripps Co.]]|last=Lopez|work=[[TheDenverChannel.com]]|accessdate=October 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and another in [[Atlanta]] closed in October of that year.&lt;ref name="Atl1001"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.ajc.com/peachbuzz/2009/10/01/confirmed-espn-zone-in-buckhead-to-close/|title=ESPN Zone in Buckhead closes|first=Richard|date=October 1, 2009|publisher=[[The Atlanta Journal-Constitution]]|last=Eldredge|work=Peach Buzz|accessdate=October 2, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091004002611/http://blogs.ajc.com/peachbuzz/2009/10/01/confirmed-espn-zone-in-buckhead-to-close|archivedate=October 4, 2009|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Atlanta location had opened in 2000,&lt;ref name="Atl1001"/&gt; while the Denver location opened in 2001.&lt;ref name="Den0629"/&gt; In both cases, Disney Regional Entertainment cited the "economic environment" as the reason for the closures.&lt;ref name="Den0629"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Atl1001"/&gt;
[[Image:ESPN Zone DC.jpg|thumb|left|Now-closed ESPN Zone in downtown Washington, D.C.]]
In June 2010, all but two locations were shuttered, with the remaining restaurants located in [[Southern California]]. As part of the decision by Walt Disney Parks and Resorts, through their [[Disney Regional Entertainment]] division, to no longer operate the restaurants in 2010, they sold the rights to operate the location in Anaheim to Zone Enterprises of Anaheim, another Disney subsidiary, and the [[L.A. Live]] location to [[Anschutz Entertainment Group]], which owns the L.A. Live complex.

====Baltimore lawsuit====
Employees at the Baltimore ESPN Zone filed a [[class action]] lawsuit against Disney and its local subsidiary after the 2010 closing, claiming that Disney had violated the [[Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act of 1988]]. U.S. federal district judge [[Catherine C. Blake]], in a January 2013 decision, found that Disney and its local subsidiary violated the Act by failing to notify workers of the closing and underpaying them. Disney and the employees settled the lawsuit in November 2013; Disney paid approximately 70 percent of the employees' back pay.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/business/bs-bz-espn-zone-settlement-20131101-story.html|title=ESPN Zone workers, employer reach settlement|last=Smith Hopkins|first=Jamie|date=November 3, 2013|work=The Baltimore Sun|access-date=June 2, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Final closures====
The Los Angeles location, housed in the ESPN West Coast headquarters building, closed in July 2013.

In October 2017, Disney announced plans to replace ESPN Zone and other Downtown Disney vendors at the [[Disneyland Resort]] with a [[resort]] hotel, in conjunction with the opening of [[Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge]] in 2019. The restaurant closed on June 2, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ocregister.com/2018/06/01/disney-says-goodbye-to-the-espn-zone-concept-as-the-chains-final-restaurant-closes-in-anaheim/|title=Disney says goodbye to the ESPN Zone concept as the chain's final restaurant closes in Anaheim|last=Fisher|first=Marla Jo|date=June 1, 2018|work=Orange County Register|access-date=June 2, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ocregister.com/2017/10/25/disneyland-cancels-eastern-gateway-project-will-build-new-parking-structure-and-four-diamond-hotel-on-the-west-side-of-the-resort/|title=Disneyland cancels parking expansion on eastern side of park, focuses on new hotel and parking on west side|last=Pimentel|first=Joseph|date=October 25, 2017|work=Orange County Register|access-date=November 7, 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==
The prototype ESPN Zone was a two-level, 35,000 square foot complex with a [[stadium]]-like design which could hold 550 customers. People could dine at the bar or restaurant area. 200 TV screens were hung from the walls and ceilings. There were two special rooms, a [[screening room]] and a 10,000 square foot arena for actual and virtual game play.&lt;ref name=bs/&gt;

ESPN Zone incorporated [[sports news]] into daily operations. Each shift, all staff were to receive daily sports news briefings. [[Placemat]]s would be generated daily as a mini-sports page of a newspaper. The chain was to change its exclusive program, games, and [[memorabilia]] regularly.&lt;ref name=bs/&gt;

===Broadcast facility===
{{Refimprove section|date=May 2017}}
All of the ESPN Zone restaurants were equipped to be [[remote broadcast|remote]] ESPN broadcast locations,&lt;ref name=bs/&gt; though only two were used to house regular series. The Anaheim ESPN Zone was the home of ''[[Unscripted with Chris Connelly]]'', from 2001 to 2002. The ESPN Zone in New York City's [[Times Square]] was used as the location of the ''[[Monday Night Football]]'' halftime show for several years. The weekly series ''[[The Sports Reporters]]'' was broadcast from the Times Square location every Sunday morning from its opening until its closing, at which point the show moved to ESPN's home base in [[Bristol, Connecticut]].

Several of the locations also had radio studios, used by the local [[ESPN Radio]] affiliate and leased to other stations on occasion.

==Events==
[[File:2009 ESPN Zone Chicago Ultimate Couch Potato Contestant - Steve Janowski 03.JPG|thumb|left|The 2009 Ultimate Couch Potato Competition at ESPN Zone Chicago.]]{{Refimprove section|date=May 2017}}
ESPN Zone hosted the Ultimate Couch Potato Competition, a competitive [[sitting]] competition. In 2009, competitions were held in New York, Chicago and Baltimore. The Baltimore winner, Jessica Mosley, unofficially broke the [[Guinness World Record]] by sitting and watching consecutive sports for an unprecedented 70 hours, and 45 seconds. She repeated as Baltimore champion in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2010-01-04/news/1001030045_1_baltimore-s-espn-zone-espn-representative-hours|title=Champion Couch Potato Repeats At Baltimore's Espn Zone|date=January 4, 2010|work=Baltimore Sun|publisher=Tribune Publishing|language=en|last1=Madigan|first1=Nick|accessdate=February 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2009 event received attention nationally, as well as from international outlets like the popular Australian television show ''[[Sunrise (Australian TV program)|Sunrise]]''.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}} Jeff Miller, the 2010 winner in Chicago broke an ESPN Zone record and also unofficially broke the [[Guinness World Record]] by watching 72 hours of non-stop sports and his third win in the competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2010-01-05/news/1001040367_1_ultimate-couch-potato-new-recliner-gift-card|title=Chicago man breaks Guinness World Record for competitive sitting, wins third straight title|date=January 5, 2010|work=Chicago Tribune|publisher=Tribune Publishing|language=en|last1=McNamara|first1=Chris|accessdate=February 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Fort Campbell, Kentucky, Children's Theatre''' was established in 1970 as a branch of Fort Campbell Community Theatre, part of the Fort Campbell Morale Welfare Music &amp; Theatre Program. Fort Campbell, Kentucky, is located on the border between Tennessee and Kentucky. Its post office is in Kentucky. The neighboring communities are [[Clarksville, TN|Clarksville]] in Tennessee and [[Oak Grove, KY|Oak Grove]] and [[Hopkinsville, KY|Hopkinsville]] in Kentucky.

== History ==
The Fort Campbell Children's Theatre was established in 1970 as part of the Morale Welfare Music and Theatre program.  It resided in a World War II building on Indiana Avenue for several years until the building was required for other military purposes.  After that, plays were held in the Soldier Show Center, also on Indiana Avenue, as well as the Cabaret Dinner Theatre.  The Cabaret Dinner Theatre was first located on Indiana Avenue, and later moved to a larger facility which had been the former recreation hall of the old hospital.  The Halloween and Christmas plays were usually held in the larger facility due to their popularity and the additional events held in conjunction with these programs, such as costume contests and visits from Santa.

The cast and crew of the plays were children who lived on Fort Campbell and in the surrounding areas.  Most were Army family members, although residents of the community were also welcome.  Rehearsals and performances were held after school, usually beginning at 4 p.m., and performances were also held at 2 p.m. on weekends.  The directors were staff members of the Music and Theatre program, as well as some guest directors.

The head of the Music &amp; Theatre Program at Fort Campbell was Lionel Austell, the Post Entertainment Director, who established the Music &amp; Theatre program in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;Interview: Austell [Interview, Lionel Austell, Clarksville, TN, October 29, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; Robert L. Taylor, a theatre specialist who had previously worked as a director at the [[Nashville, Tennessee, Children's Theatre|Nashville Children's Theatre]], organized the Children's Theatre program shortly after joining the staff at Fort Campbell. Taylor also directed plays for adults, which were presented in the Soldier Show Center and in the Cabaret Dinner Theatre.&lt;ref&gt;Interview: Taylor {Interview, Robert L. Taylor, Oak Grove, KY, September 14, 1993]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Children's Theatre was active for nearly 16 years, until the dissolution of the Music &amp; Theatre program in 1986. Many of the plays were original adaptations of stories and fairy tales in the public domain, and some were totally original. After the initial launch, Heide Hepler, who was music specialist with the Music &amp; Theatre program, shared management of the Children's Theatre with Taylor. Approximately 8-10 children's plays were presented annually.&lt;ref&gt;Interview: Hepler [Interview, Heide Hepler, Clarksvillel, TN, October 29, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Billy St. John]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pioneerdrama.com/AuthorDetail.asp?ac=STJOHNBILL Pioneer Drama]&lt;/ref&gt; a theatre specialist and a published author of plays, gave technical support with set design, costuming, lighting and other advice regarding the Children's Theatre. St. John's duties were primarily in the adult productions of the Soldier Show Center and the Cabaret Dinner Theatre; although an important element of the Children's Theatre, he was not one of the regular directors.

Lilo Rogoish, a family member, became costume designer and seamstress for many of the Children's Theatre productions as well as the adult plays held at the other theatres.  Upon dissolution of the Music and Theatre program, Rogoish became head costume designer for the theatre program at Austin Peay State University in Clarksville, TN.

== Productions ==
Both Hepler and Taylor wrote original plays, adapted plays in public domain, and produced and directed published plays for the Children's Theatre. All acting and technical roles were filled by children and teenagers in the local area, with occasional technical support from adults, often parents and soldiers who were volunteers with the theatre program. Participation as performers, technicians and audience members was open to residents of the surrounding communities as well as the military and their family members residing on- and off-post.  This was part of the community relations incentive of the installation.

Special costumes were provided from the inventory of the Soldier Show Center, designed and created by staff members and parents, and were often commissioned. Lilo Rogoish,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theleafchronicle.com/article/20111005/LIFESTYLE/110050307/APSU-costume-guru-still-sewing-strong-85?nclick_check=1 The Leaf-Chronicle]&lt;/ref&gt; a community member and costume designer, often created costumes for the Children's Theatre as well as Soldier Show Center and Cabaret Dinner Theatre productions.&lt;ref&gt;Interview: Rogoish {Interview, Lilo Rogoish, Clarksville, TN, October 29, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; When the Music and Theatre program closed, Rogoish became head of the costume department of the theatre program at [[Austin Peay State University]] in Clarksville.

Taylor and Hepler often collaborated on original musicals, including ''The Witch Who Went West'', a Halloween production, and ''The Toymaker'', a Christmas production.  The script and lyrics were written by Taylor, with music composed by Hepler. Dr. Charles H. Ball, professor of music education at the [[University of Tennessee]] in Knoxville, collaborated with the two on the music of ''The Witch Who Went West'' and provided a soundtrack to be used with the production.&lt;ref&gt;Interview: Ball [Interview, Dr. Charles H. Ball, Knoxville, TN, November 1, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

Additional plays adapted by Taylor include [[Coppélia]], ''[[The Steadfast Tin Soldier]]'', ''[[Pinnochio]]'', ''[[Swan Lake]]'' and ''[[Sleeping Beauty]]''. Adaptations written by Hepler include ''[[Alice in Wonderland]]'', ''[[Through the Looking Glass]]'', ''[[Hansel and Gretel]]'' and ''[[The Pied Piper]]''.

Andre La France, a soldier stationed at Fort Campbell, served as guest director for the production of his original play, ''Princess Tina''. Megan Hepler, nine years old, played the title role.  The Children's Theatre occasionally sponsored playwriting contests, with the winning entries being produced at the theatre.

== Halloween and Christmas plays ==
Halloween, Christmas,and other special occasion productions were popular at the Children's Theatre.

The annual Halloween production, usually directed by Hepler, started with a play that was followed by a costume contest, door prizes and refreshments. ''The Witch Who Went West'', a musical collaboration with book and lyrics by Taylor, music by Hepler and soundtrack by Dr. Ball, was the story of a young witch who became bored with her life and decided to go west to find new adventures.

The Christmas production was directed by Taylor. One of the plays was his original, ''The Toymaker'', also a musical collaboration, featured two of Santa's elves whose job it is to make toys for Christmas delivery by using a large Toymaker machine. "Junk" goes into one side and beautiful toys come out on the other. When the Toymaker breaks just before delivery time, the elves have the dilemma of trying to fix the machine so that everything will be on schedule.

== Touring plays ==
In 1984, the Children's Theatre organized a tour of the Disney children's musical version of ''Alice in Wonderland'' to all the elementary schools at Fort Campbell. The soundtrack was pre-recorded by all the children who performed in the play. Parents helped to shuttle the cast members and set pieces from school to school for nearly a week. All cast members were excused from their regular attendance by participating schools in order to participate in the tour.

One year the Children's Theatre presented short skits and comedy routines on a portable stage for the annual Fort Campbell Fourth of July Celebration. The popular celebration, open to all residents of the surrounding communities, also included games, static displays, food and a band concert, followed by fireworks. The event was always held at a post parade field.

== Closing of the Children's Theatre  ==
The Children's Theatre was a popular venue at Fort Campbell until the termination of the Music &amp; Theatre Program in 1986. After that, plays, including plays for children, were sometimes presented at Dale Wayrynen Recreation Center at Fort Campbell.

'''Funtime Comics''' is a [[Christchurch]], New Zealand based collective of comic artists and writers whose aim is to provide a forum for the promotion and discussion of the comic medium, promote New Zealand comics and encourage local writers and artists through the publishing of their own comics. Funtime publishes the '''Funtime Comics Anthology''', and a variety of other comics, many of which are collaborative efforts, featuring stories and artwork from local and international comics artists.

==History==
Funtime Comics was formed in 1990 by a group of comic artists and enthusiasts from the [[University of Canterbury]].&lt;ref name="Funtime Name"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.comics.org.nz/wiki/index.php?title=Reading_Community_in_Funtime_Comics:_A_New_Zealand_Narrative|title=Reading Community in Funtime Comics: A New Zealand Narrative - Comics.org.nz|accessdate=2009-03-17|year=2009|work=International Journal of Comic Art, Vol 2, No.2, Fall 2000.|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081017210729/http://www.comics.org.nz/wiki/index.php?title=Reading_Community_in_Funtime_Comics%3A_A_New_Zealand_Narrative|archivedate=2008-10-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first anthology was published the following year under the editorship of Bean McGregor, Jason Brice (founder of [[Comics Bulletin]]) and Nigel Campbell, with the name Funtime coming from a competition for the title and cover banner won by Debra Boyask.&lt;ref name="Funtime Name"/&gt; Edward Dewe assumed the editorship for the next three issues in 1992-1993.&lt;ref name="Oldest1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.comics.org.nz/wiki/index.php?title=Funtime_Comics_Presents|title=Funtime Comics Anthology - Comics.org.nz|accessdate=2009-03-17|year=2009|work=New Zealand Comics - Comics.org.nz|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081015071621/http://www.comics.org.nz/wiki/index.php?title=Funtime_Comics_Presents|archivedate=2008-10-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Issue 2 was the first published under the series title '''Funtime Comics Presents''', the name by which it was known until Issue 22.

Issue 5 came out in November 1993 under the editorship of [[Darren Schroeder]]. He remained editor up until the publication of Issue 21 in 2005. It was during Darren's long-standing editorship that the Funtime anthology extended its range to include contributions from other parts of New Zealand and overseas. He also established the tradition of 
monthly Funtime Workshops at which members draw comics and drink tea and eat [[Animal cracker|animal biscuits]].&lt;ref name="Funtime Comics"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.comics.org.nz/wiki/index.php?title=Funtime_Comics|title=Funtime Comics - Comics.org.nz|accessdate=2009-03-17|year=2009|work=New Zealand Comics - Comics.org.nz|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081015052414/http://www.comics.org.nz/wiki/index.php?title=Funtime_Comics|archivedate=2008-10-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; His efforts also extended to the promotion of New Zealand comics through the creation of the most comprehensive and authoritative resource on New Zealand Comics, the website '''New Zealand Comics - Comics.org.nz'''.&lt;ref name="NZ Comics"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.comics.org.nz|title=New Zealand Comics - Comics.org.nz|accessdate=2009-03-17|year=2009|work=New Zealand Comics - Comics.org.nz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Current editor Isaac Freeman has produced four issues of the regular anthology since mid-2007. In 2011 a special issue of Funtime Comics Anthology was released in response to the devastating [[February 2011 Christchurch earthquake|earthquake of 22 February 2011]] in Funtime's home town of Christchurch, New Zealand. Contributors from all around the world sent work for the special issue and all proceeds from the sale of the comic went to the Red Cross.&lt;ref name="Funtime Comics2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://funtime.comics.org.nz|title=Funtime Comics|accessdate=2011-09-25|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Achievements==

Isaac Freeman and Funtime Comics published issue 23 (January 2009) under the new series name '''Funtime Comics Anthology'''. With the publication of this issue it is now believed to be New Zealand's longest-running title, in years and number of issues.&lt;ref name="Oldest1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Oldest2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.spiderfan.org/better/2005/0812.html |title=Better Read: Funtime Comics #19 |accessdate=2009-03-23 |year=2009 |work=SpiderFan.org |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080719104745/http://spiderfan.org/better/2005/0812.html |archivedate=July 19, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Geography of media and communication''' (also known as [[communication geography]], [[media geography]] and [[geographies of media]]) is an interdisciplinary research area bringing together [[human geography]] with [[media studies]] and [[communication theory]]. Research addressing the geography of media and communication seeks to understand how acts of communication and the systems they depend on both shape and are shaped by geographical patterns and processes.

== Overview ==
Geography of media and communication is an area of research, which considers various facets of communication. One interest is the layout and organization of communication systems at scales from cities to the planet. Closely related to this are the varying levels of access to communication systems from place to place. Attention to how places differ in regard to communication access leads to an interest in the changes that occur in places when new media diffuse into those places. A complementary interest is in how places are represented in various media—for example pictures of idyllic beaches in tourism advertisements or written descriptions of war zones in newspaper stories. Communications also allow people to interact with distant places, so a final area of investigation is how, by interacting with others through various kinds of communication systems, people inhabit various kinds of "virtual" spaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite article |last1=Adams |first1=Paul C. |last2=Jansson |first2=André |year=2012 |title=Communication Geography: A Bridge between Disciplines |journal=Communication Theory |volume=22 |pages=299-317.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Crang |first1=Mike |last2=Crang |first2=Phil |last3=May |first3=Jon |title=Virtual Geographies: Bodies, Space and Relations |place=London |publisher=Routledge |year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of particular interest to media/communication theorists are questions regarding the social and cultural formations associated with media, which in turn point to how media are involved in the transformation of belonging and citizenship, which relate to geographical territories. Social and cultural formations also depend on distinctions between public and private life, which have traditionally depended on spatial boundaries between public and private places.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Couldry |first=Nick |title=Media, society, world: Social theory and digital media practice |publisher=Polity|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Georgiou |first=Myria |title=Media and the city: Cosmopolitanism and Difference |publisher=Polity |year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article |last1=Sheller |first1=Mimi |last2=Urry |first2=John |title=Mobile transformations of ‘public’ and ‘private’ life |journal=Theory, Culture &amp; Society |year=2003 |number=3 |page=107-125}}&lt;/ref&gt; Topics of particular interest to geographers are place representations in visual media including photography, film and graffiti, in auditory media including radio and music recordings, and even in embodied communications such as dance and video games.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Ashgate Research Companion to Media Geography|last1=Adams|first1=Paul C. |last2=Craine |first2=Jim |last3=Dittmer |first3=Jason |publisher=Ashgate |location=Burlington, VT Press |year=2014 |isbn= 978-1409444015 |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Austroneske jazyky.jpg|thumb|left|Map of the culture region corresponding to the Austronesian language family]]
Geographical interest in the systematic study of communication can be traced to the writings of [[Richard Hartshorne]] in the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hartshorne |first=Richard |title=The nature of geography: A critical survey of current thought in the light of the past |publisher=Annals of the Association of American Geographers |year=1939}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hartshorne considered language to be a key element forming culture regions, meaning that the dominant language is similar within a particular culture region and it changes when one leaves a culture region. A very different aspect of communication became the focus during the 1950s and 1960s as geographers began to measure and model the interactions between locations. In this case, geographers involved in the [[quantitative revolution]] explained the accelerating flow of information between [[location (geography)|locations]] in terms of "time-space convergence" and "human extensibility."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite article |last=Janelle |first=Donald G. |year=1968 |title= Central Place Development in a Time‐Space Framework |journal=Professional Geographer |volume=20 |pages=5-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article |last=Janelle |first=Donald G. |year=1973 |title= Measuring human extensibility in a shrinking world |journal=Journal of Geography |volume=72 |number=2 |pages=8-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until the 1970s that geographers began to focus on communications in terms of content, considering questions of symbolism, [[Representation theory (linguistics)|representation]], [[metaphor]], [[iconography]] and [[discourse]]. This interest first took form in geographical research that drew on [[humanism]], [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] and [[hermeneutics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Tuan |first=Yi-Fu |title=Space and Place: The Perspective of Experience |place=Minneapolis |publisher=University of Minnesota Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1990s, this approach shifted towards a more critical sensibility unpacking the various meanings of [[landscape]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Burgess |first1=Jacquelin |last2=Gold |first2=John R. |title=Geography, the Media and Popular Culture |publisher=Croom Helm |year=1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Duncan |first1=James S. |last2=Ley |first2=David |title=Place/Culture/Representation |publisher=Routledge |location=London |year=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Barnes |first1=Trevor J. |last2=Duncan |first2=James S. |title=Writing Worlds: Discourse, Text and Metaphor in the Representation of Landscape |publisher=Routledge |location=London |year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Geographers researching communication over the past two decades have extended these research areas while carrying forward early insights regarding the importance of communication to the formation of regions, the rate of information flow as a measure of spatial interaction, and the association between landscape and representation. New approaches to communication have been advanced under the frameworks of [[non-representational theory]], [[actor-network theory]], and [[assemblage theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Thrift |first=Nigel |title=Non-representational Theory: Space, Politics, Affect |publisher=Routledge |location=London and New York |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article |last=Murdoch |first=Jonathan |year=1998 |title=The spaces of actor-network theory  |journal=Geoforum |volume=29 |number=4 |pages=357-374}}&lt;/ref&gt; Equally important is the effort to think through digital code and its relationship with space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kitchin |first1=Rob |last2=Dodge |first2=Martin |title=Code/Space: Software and Everyday Life |publisher=MIT Press |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Areas of study ==
[[File:September 11 Photo Montage.jpg|thumb|right|World Trade Center Photo Montage; a place represented in media images; an example of place-in-media]]
According to one taxonomy, the geography of media and communication involves four complementary aspects: places-in-media, media-in-places, media-in-spaces and spaces-in-media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite article |last1=Adams |first1=Paul C. |last2=Jansson |first2=André |year=2012 |title=Communication Geography: A Bridge between Disciplines |journal=Communication Theory |volume=22 |pages=299-317.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article |last=Adams |first=Paul C. |title=A taxonomy for communication geography |journal=Progress in Human Geography |volume=35 |issue=1 |year=2011 |pages=37-57}}&lt;/ref&gt; Places-in-media are representations of place circulating in all sorts of media for all sorts of reasons, for example landscape paintings signifying the owner's status, and news images of urban spaces linking crime and chaos to minority populations and the poor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Burgess |first1=Jacquelin |last2=Gold |first2=John R. |title=Geography, the Media and Popular Culture |publisher=Croom Helm |year=1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; Media-in-places are ways in which particular places such as the home, classroom, workplace, or city street are altered functionally and experientially by transformations in how people use media in those places.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Morley |first=David |title=Family Television: Cultural Power and Domestic Leisure |publisher=Routledge |location=London |year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Media-in-spaces are communication infrastructures, whether historical, like telegraph cables, or contemporary like [[optical fiber cable]] when mapped and analyzed in terms of their physical layout. Spaces-in-media are the topologies that symbols, images, information and ideas move through as they spread or diffuse from person to person and from group to group.

'''Gun fu''', a [[portmanteau]] of ''[[gun]]'' and ''[[kung fu]]'' (also known as '''gun kata''', '''bullet ballet''', and '''gymnastic gunplay'''),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|publisher=Seattle Post Intelligencer | url=http://www.seattlepi.com/movies/98610_equilibrium06q.shtml | title=Just saying no to drugs in the fascist future | author=Sean Axmaker | date=December 6, 2002|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a fictional style of sophisticated close-quarters [[Gunfighter|Gunfight]] resembling a [[martial arts]] battle played out with [[firearms]] instead of traditional weapons. It can be seen in [[Hong Kong action cinema]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Cinema of Tsui Hark|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Hv3yJ6MaoYsC|page=203|author=Lisa Morton|publisher=McFarland|isbn=0-7864-0990-8|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in American films influenced by it.

The focus of gun fu is both style and the usage of firearms in ways that they were not designed to be used. Shooting a gun from each hand (usually paired with jumping to the side at the same time), shots from behind the back, as well as the use of guns as [[melee weapon]]s are all common. Other moves can involve [[shotgun]]s, [[submachine gun]]s, [[Shoulder-launched missile weapon|rocket launchers]], and just about anything else that can be worked into a cinematic shot. It is often mixed with [[unarmed combat|hand-to-hand]] combat maneuvers.

Gun fu has become a staple factor in modern [[action films]] due to its visually appealing nature (regardless of its actual practicality in a real-life combat situation). This is a contrast to American action movies of the 1980s which focused more on heavy weaponry and outright brute-force in firearm-based combat.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

==Heroic bloodshed==
{{main|Heroic bloodshed}}
Director [[John Woo]] originated the style in the [[Cinema of Hong Kong|Hong Kong film]] ''[[A Better Tomorrow]]'' in 1986. The film launched the "heroic bloodshed" genre in Hong Kong, and gun fu action sequences became a regular feature in many of the subsequent heroic bloodshed films. John Woo continued to make several classic heroic bloodshed films, all featuring gun fu, and all starring leading man [[Chow Yun-fat]].

Anthony Leong wrote of the gunfights in ''A Better Tomorrow'',&lt;ref name=leong&gt;{{cite web | url = http://members.aol.com/aleong1631/johnwoo.html | title =  The Films of John Woo and the Art of Heroic Bloodshed | first = Anthony | last = Leong | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071130095951/http://members.aol.com/aleong1631/johnwoo.html | archivedate = November 30, 2007 | year = 1998 | accessdate = February 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{quote|Before 1986, Hong Kong cinema was firmly rooted in two genres: the [[martial arts film]] and the [[comedy film|comedy]]. Gunplay was not terribly popular because audiences had considered it boring, compared to fancy [[kung-fu]] moves or graceful swordplay of the [[wuxia|wu shu]] epics. What moviegoers needed was a new way to present gunplay—to show it as a skill that could be honed, integrating the acrobatics and grace of the traditional martial arts. And that's exactly what John Woo did. Using all of the visual techniques available to him ([[tracking shot]]s, dolly-ins, [[slow motion|slo-mo]]), Woo created beautifully surrealistic action sequences that were a 'guilty pleasure' to watch. There is also intimacy found in the gunplay—typically, his protagonists and antagonists will have a profound understanding of one another and will meet face-to-face, in a tense [[Mexican standoff]] where they each point their weapons at one another and trade words.}}
[[Stephen Hunter]], writing in ''[[The Washington Post]]'' wrote,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/04/19/AR2007041901817.html | title = Cinematic Clues To Understand The Slaughter | first = Stephen | last = Hunter | date = April 20, 2007 | work = [[The Washington Post]] | accessdate = February 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{quote|Woo saw gunfights in [[Musical film|musical]] terms: His primary conceit was the shootout as dance number, with great attention paid to choreography, the movement of both actors within the frame. He loved to send his shooters flying through the air in surprising ways, far more poetically than in any real-life scenario. He frequently diverted to slow motion and he specialized in shooting not merely to kill, but to riddle—his shooters often blast their opponents five and six times.}}
Other Hong Kong directors also began using gun fu sequences in films that were not strictly heroic bloodshed films, such as [[Wong Jing]]'s ''[[God of Gamblers]]'' (1989). There were several heroic bloodshed films that did not feature gun fu, but opted for more realistic combat, such as [[Ringo Lam]]'s ''[[City on Fire (1987 film)|City on Fire]]'' (1987).

==Spread to the US==
The popularity of [[John Woo]]'s films, and the heroic bloodshed genre in general, in the U.S. helped give the gun fu style greater visibility.

One classic gun fu move consists of reloading two [[pistol]]s simultaneously by releasing the empty [[magazine (firearm)|magazine]]s, pointing the guns to the ground, dropping two fresh magazines out of one's jacket sleeves, or strapped to one's legs, into the guns, and then carrying on shooting. In ''[[Equilibrium (film)|Equilibrium]]'' (2002) the law enforcement responsible for handling "Sense Crime" are trained in ''gun kata'' to gain an advantage in their raids on armed opponents. In the film ''[[Bulletproof Monk]]'' (2003), The Monk With No Name (portrayed by [[Chow Yun-fat]]) empties two pistols, ejects the magazines and spins to kick the empty magazines at his assailants. The style is also featured (albeit in a small way and with the assistance of gadgets) in the ''[[Lara Croft: Tomb Raider]]'' movies. In ''[[Wanted (2008 film)|Wanted]]'' (2008), assassins belonging to The Fraternity possess the skill of "bending" bullets around obstacles; in a gunfight early in the film, one assassin knocks another bullet out of the air with his own round. In ''[[X-Men Origins: Wolverine]]'' (2009), [[Agent Zero]] ([[Daniel Henney]]) reloads his handguns by throwing them into the air and catching them with the magazines he's holding in his hands.

In the [[2010 in film|2010]] film ''[[Kick-Ass (film)|Kick-Ass]]'', the character [[Hit Girl]], played by [[Chloë Grace Moretz]], frequently uses gun fu.  In the 2012 film ''[[Django Unchained]]'', the climactic shootout in Candieland is inspired by John Woo, replicating scenes from ''[[The Killer (1989 film)|The Killer]]'' shot-by-shot.  The 2013 ''[[G.I. Joe: Retaliation]]'' also featured gun fu in the climactic fight between [[Roadblock (G.I. Joe)|Roadblock]] and [[Firefly (G.I. Joe)|Firefly]]. Gun fu is also featured heavily in the 2014 film ''[[John Wick (film)|John Wick]]'' and [[John Wick: Chapter 2|its sequel]], as well as the 2015 film ''[[Kingsman: The Secret Service]]''.
In the 2017 CGI film ''[[Resident Evil: Vendetta]]'', Chris Redfield and Glenn Arias engaged in a gun fu fighting sequence.

==Video games==
{{main|Dual wield}}{{tone|section|date=May 2012}}{{example farm|section|date=May 2012}}
The ''[[Half-Life (video game)|Half-Life]]'' game modification "[[The Specialists]]" is one of the very few examples of multiplayer gun fu.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} The mod features melee and gun combat, with encounters often resulting in frenzied exchanges involving both types of attack. Dual-wielding weapons, slow motion, and advanced melee are popular features of the mod which still has a loyal following years after the final version was announced.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} Another ''Half-Life'' mod, "The Opera", is named after Hong Kong blood operas, and features akimbo-wielded handguns and stylized gunplay - players are awarded cash for stylish kills performed during flips, cartwheels, and other martial-arts inspired maneuvers.

"Gun fu" moves, closely tied with a slo-mo concept essential to their execution, appear in the video game ''[[Max Payne (video game)|Max Payne]]'', along with dual-wielding various weapons, including semi-automatic pistols and [[machine pistol]]s such as the [[Uzi]] and the [[Gordon Ingram|Ingram]] [[MAC-10]]. The game, itself heavily influenced by [[Hong Kong action cinema]], arguably signified the advent of extensive slo-mo as an interactive device in videogames.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

''[[Shadow Hearts: From the New World]]'' features a character, Natan, whose special skill is labeled "Gun Fu" and is designed to resemble the martial art.

Dante, from the [[Devil May Cry (series)|Devil May Cry series]], employs gun fu using a variety of firearms, the wielding of dual pistols being his trademark.

In 2007, [[Stranglehold (video game)|''Stranglehold'']], a game sequel to John Woo's cult film ''Hard Boiled'', was released, which featured the protagonist Police Inspector Tequila on another blood driven conquest.

Noel Vermillion from the fighting game ''[[BlazBlue]]'' also uses Gun Kata with her two Nox Nyctores pistols, called Arcus Diabolus Bolverk.

In 2009, [[Cryptic Studios]] released ''[[Champions Online]]'' which features a Munitions [[character class]] with skills involving dual-wielding pistols; many of the powers combine firing with martial arts, including a power called "Bullet Ballet" and a high level ability called "Lead Tempest". The similar game ''[[City of Heroes]]'' incorporated a Dual Pistols power set in the expansion pack, ''Going Rogue'', which involves switching between ammunition types mid-combat and various trick shots.

[[Wet (video game)|''Wet'']], a grindhouse-inspired,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |people=Interview with Patrick Fortier, Creative Director, Wet, Artificial Mind and Movement (A2M) |date=May 5, 2009 |title=A2M Video Interview |medium=Video interview |url=http://www.ign.com/videos/2009/05/05/wet-xbox-360-interview-a2m-video-interview |time=2:16 |publisher=IGN}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tarantino-esque shooter action game, was also released in 2009. Rubi Malone, the main player character, carries an assortment of weapons, including twin pistols, dual shotguns, and submachine guns, and if the player fires these guns while acrobatically jumping through the air, sliding on the ground, or running on a wall, then the game will slow down into bullet-time. Performing successive kills while in this bullet-time state increases Rubi's health regeneration rate and the player's points score, which is used to purchase upgrades.

The titular character in the video game ''[[Bayonetta]]'' features combat resembling gun fu. In addition to hand-held pistols, the character has pistols built into the high heels of her boots. Her guns range from her signature weapon, "Scarborough Fair",{{clarify|date=May 2015}} to rocket launchers and unique "gun-chuckiez".{{clarify|date=May 2015}}

The Ranger/Desperado class in ''[[Dungeon Fighter Online]]'' has several "gun fu" style abilities.

The online game, ''[[Ragnarok Online]]'', has a Gunslinger class, whose main skills resemble gun fu. Gunslinger's advanced class, Rebellion, also has gun fu skills, and is also the only class capable of wielding the powerful Altair and Ares, a pair of guns.

A Korean made online game, ''[[S4 League]]'', features this type of gameplay.

The 2012 video game, ''[[The Darkness II]]'', has "Gun Kata" as one of the abilities that can be purchased.

2013 video game ''[[Deadpool (video game)|Deadpool]]'' also features "Gun Kata" as a non-upgrade-able skill.

Athena from 2014's ''Borderlands - The Pre-Sequel'' has a skill called Gun Kata that boosts her gun and melee damage.

Vayne, a character from the MOBA Game "[[League of Legends]]" does the Gun Kata stances in her dance animation. In addition, the character Lucian does Gun Kata in his recall animation.

In the 2016 game ''[[Overwatch (video game)|Overwatch]]'', the character Reaper performs a Gun Kata-Styled attack when using his ultimate ability: Death Blossom.

In the Free to Play game Warframe, the frame known as Mesa has an ability called Peacemaker in which she goes into an aimbot mode and does Gun Kata moves as she shoots enemies.

In [[Skylanders: Imaginators]], the class of Senseis and Imagiantors known as gunslingers use special techniques based around gunkata.

In the video game series, [[Hitman (franchise)|Hitman]], the main character Agent 47 dual wields pistols

==Other media==
''Gun Fu'' is also the name of a series of [[comic books]] by Howard M. Shum and Joey Mason, about a Hong Kong police officer in the 1930s who employs a combination of gun-play and martial arts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.howardshum.com/gunfu.html  Comic book series]&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''[[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]]'' comic books, the character Orson Randall uses his Iron Fist power with his two fire-arms, which a colleague jokingly refers to as "Gun-Fu".{{Issue|date=May 2011}}

In the [[Buffyverse role-playing games]], gun fu is the name for the firearms skill, but this is more likely meant to be humorous rather than to imply characters practice an actual firearm-based martial art.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

In the ''[[Ninjas and Superspies]]'' supplement ''Mystic China'', gun fu is the [[Triad (underground society)|Triad]] assassin training, and is a martial arts skill that can be available to player characters. It primarily emphasizes the use of paired 9mm pistols.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

In the Japanese series ''[[Tokusou Sentai Dekaranger]]'', DekaRed is specifically mentioned as a master of gun fu technique, which in the series is called as "''Juu Kun Do''" ({{lang|ja-Latn|jaa}} is the Japanese word for 'gun'). As a result, the mecha for the series, Dekaranger Robo, is also sometimes shown using gun fu. The American adaptation of the series, ''[[Power Rangers S.P.D.]]'', also shows the Red Ranger and the Delta Squad Megazord using the same technique, though that was more because of the source material - the S.P.D. Red Ranger isn't specifically mentioned as being a master of gun fu.

In the anime ''[[Mazinkaizer SKL]]'', Ryou Magami (one of the two pilots of the titular Mazinkaiser) uses gun fu as his primary style of combat as he wields the Breast Triggers, a pair of handguns which store on Mazinkaiser's chest.  Magami's fight scenes contain several visual homages to the film ''[[Equilibrium (film)|Equilibrium]]'', including a scene in the first episode where Mazinkaiser performs the signature pose of the Grammaton Clerics.

In "Run and Gun", a expansion of the fifth-edition of the pen-and-paper [[role-playing game]] ''[[Shadowrun]]'', gun fu is a combat style available.

{{Nihongo|'''''Higurashi: When They Cry'''''|ひぐらしのなく頃に|Higurashi no Naku Koro ni|lit. ''When the [[Tanna japonensis|Evening Cicada]]s Cry''}}, known simply as '''''When They Cry''''' for the North American release of the anime adaptation, is a Japanese [[murder mystery]] [[dōjin soft]] [[sound novel]] series produced by [[07th Expansion]]. The games are built on the [[NScripter]] [[game engine]] and are playable on the [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] [[operating system]]. The first game in the series, ''Onikakushi-hen'', was released on August 10, 2002, and the eighth and final game in the original PC series, ''Matsuribayashi-hen'', was released on August 13, 2006. While the first four games carried the overall title ''Higurashi no Naku Koro ni'', the next four games were produced under the title ''Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Kai''. A bonus fan disc called ''Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Rei'' was released on December 31, 2006. In addition to the original series, new [[story arc]]s were created in [[manga]] form and in [[video game]]s for the [[PlayStation 2]] and [[Nintendo DS]] in order to expand upon the story. The original eight PC releases were released in English by [[MangaGamer]] in 2009 and 2010. The series focuses on a group of young friends living in the rural village of Hinamizawa and the strange events that occur in 1983.

Two sets of [[Radio drama in Japan|drama CDs]] were produced, one by Wayuta and the other by [[Frontier Works]]. Novelizations of the game series were released by [[Kodansha Box]] between August 2007 and March 2009. A manga series adapted from the games began with eight different [[manga artist]]s working separately on one to three of the multiple story arcs and were published by [[Square Enix]] and [[Kadokawa Shoten]]. The manga was licensed for release in English in North America by [[Yen Press]] under the title ''Higurashi: When They Cry'' and the first volume was released in November 2008. Following the manga's release in Japan, two anime television series were produced by [[Studio Deen]] in 2006 and 2007; a third anime adaptation was released as an [[original video animation]] (OVA) series in 2009. The first anime series was licensed by [[Geneon Entertainment]] in English, but the license expired in 2011. [[Sentai Filmworks]] has since licensed both anime seasons and the ''Rei'' OVAs. A live-action film adaptation of the series, directed by [[Ataru Oikawa]], premiered in Japanese theaters in May 2008, with a sequel released in May 2009. A six-episode live-action television series adaptation premiered in Japan in May 2016, and a four-episode sequel premiered in November 2016.

==Gameplay==
''Higurashi'' is a [[murder mystery]] game described as a "sound novel" by [[07th Expansion]]. A sound novel is similar to a [[visual novel]] in that the gameplay requires relatively little player interaction as most of the game is composed of text dialogues. The original release contained no voice acting for the characters. While a visual novel's basis would be the visual aspect as the name suggests, a sound novel's basis takes more care in producing an atmosphere via the music, sound effects, and the story itself.

The game utilizes intermissions where the player can obtain several Tips. These Tips allow the player to read various supplementary information that may or may not be useful in solving the mystery. For example, one of the Tips can be as simple as "this is a small village; children who go to this school are combined into one classroom regardless of what grade or year they are in." On the other hand, they can provide valuable hints, such as being able to read the excerpts of the newspaper articles regarding the murders that occurred in Hinamizawa. At the beginning of each of the story arcs, a cryptic poem by someone known as Frederica Bernkastel is read; these reveal some of what is going to happen in the following arc.

The PlayStation 2 port ''Matsuri'' differs from the original game series in that it includes full voice acting, redrawn CGs, and integration of the question arcs starring Keiichi into a single branching storyline. ''Matsuri'' includes the first seven PC arcs (''Matsuribayashi-hen'' is excluded) and three original final arcs—''Taraimawashi-hen'', ''Tsukiotoshi-hen'' and ''Miotsukushi-hen''. After the original seven arcs are cleared, the first two final arcs become available. Furthermore, when these two final arcs are cleared, the epilogue, ''Miotsukushi-hen'', is unlocked. The DS ports that compose ''Kizuna'' include most of the CGs from Matsuri, as well as some new ones, a similar arc integration system to ''Matsuri'', and partial voice acting for certain emphasized scenes.

==Characters==
{{main|List of Higurashi no Naku Koro ni characters}}
In ''Higurashi: When They Cry'', there are seven main characters who appear in almost every scenario. The main protagonist is Keiichi Maebara, a young boy who has recently moved to Hinamizawa with his family and begun to adapt to life in the countryside. Keiichi has a natural charisma which allows him to make friends easily. Since the village is a small town of about two thousand people with only a single school, there are not many children around his own age; he easily meets the others his age and becomes friends with them.

One of these good friends is a seemingly ditsy and sweet girl named Rena Ryugu. She, like Keiichi, is new in Hinamizawa, having only returned from [[Ibaraki Prefecture|Ibaraki]] a year before the story begins. She has an obsession with things she considers to be cute—generally, others do not agree—and will often scavenge for such things at the local dump and bring them back home. Before she met Keiichi, Rena became friends with a tomboy Mion Sonozaki, the leader of the group and president of their club, who keeps secrets hidden from the others. Her twin sister, Shion, lives in Okinomiya. Although their personalities are different, she and Mion have switched places in the past, and the change is nearly indistinguishable.

There are other girls in the club younger than Keiichi, Rena and Mion. One is Satoko Hojo, a clever girl who is quite skilled at setting traps when playing games with her friends. She usually has an energetic and mischievous personality, but this hides a past full of trauma. Her older brother, Satoshi becomes similar to Keiichi. Her friend, Rika Furude, is revered by the villagers as the heir of the local shrine and plays the role of a [[miko]] in the annual Watanagashi Festival. Despite her young age, she sometimes expresses a type of wisdom which would normally be beyond her years and is quite fond of [[sake]]. Rika is also the girl who becomes the central figure so that the village can avoid a tragic end. Hanyū, a goddess who appears late in the story but in fact, has been with Rika for a very long time, though only Rika can see her.

Of the remaining cast, there are those such as Oishi Kuraudo, the soon to be retired police officer, who solves the mystery of the disappearances, including freelance photographer Jirō Tomitake, and clinic nurse and mercenary leader Miyo Takano. Takano has a keen interest in the village's past and culture. She works with the head doctor and baseball coach, Kyosuke Irie, who takes care of Satoko.

==Plot==
[[File:SHIRAKAWA GOU.JPG|thumb|200px|left|[[Shirakawa, Gifu (village)|Shirakawa, Gifu]], the village used as the basis for Hinamizawa.]]

===Story overview===
''Higurashi: When They Cry'' takes place during June 1983 in a fictional rural village called {{Nihongo|Hinamizawa|雛見沢}} (based on the village of [[Shirakawa, Gifu (village)|Shirakawa, Gifu]], a [[World Heritage Site]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://07th-expansion.net/Soft/Map00.htm|title=Hinamizawa is based on Shirakawa, Gifu|publisher=[[07th Expansion]]|accessdate=2006-07-12|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://park17.wakwak.com/~mahosaro/higurashi_seiti.html|title=More references to Shirakawa, Gifu|accessdate=2006-07-16|language=Japanese|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060614083329/http://park17.wakwak.com/~mahosaro/higurashi_seiti.html|archivedate=June 14, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; which has a population of approximately 2,000. The main character, Keiichi Maebara, moves to Hinamizawa and befriends his new classmates Rena Ryugu, Mion Sonozaki, Rika Furude, and Satoko Hojo. Keiichi joins their after-school club activities, which consist mostly of card and board games (and punishment games for the loser – usually him). Hinamizawa appears to be a normal, peaceful, rural village to Keiichi. However, the tranquility abruptly ends after the annual Watanagashi Festival, a celebration to commemorate and give thanks to the local god, ''Oyashiro''. Keiichi learns that every year for the past four years, one person has been murdered, and another has gone missing on the evening of the Watanagashi Festival. Keiichi himself soon becomes drawn into the strange events surrounding the Watanagashi Festival and Oyashiro. In each story arc, he or one of his friends becomes paranoid and a crime is committed. Usually, the crime involves the murder of one of their own friends.

While the story arcs follow various plots, the general basis is thus: During ancient times, the village where Hinamizawa sits is founded, unknowingly near a swamp that contains a parasite that causes paranoia and eventual madness. This parasite is interpreted by the villagers at the time to be demonic possession, and laws are placed that state it is taboo to leave the village. This law is eventually enshrined as holy laws of a local deity, Oyashiro, and the punishment eventually becomes death by torture, as the village became paranoid of being wiped out if too many "demons" leave the village. Living in the village, and the presence of the shrine maidens, who produce a sort of pheromone, holds the disease in check.

Eventually, the village customs fade, and in 1983, a bioweapons researcher named Miyo Takano decides to deliberately release the disease to vindicate the work of her adoptive grandfather, who was mocked and shamed by the scientific community for his thesis about the disease, by killing the current shrine maiden, Rika. However, a spirit, Hanyu, rewinds time to save Rika's life. But rather than simply reset, the universe of the rewound time becomes slightly different, influenced by changed past events of the characters' lives and personalities, with Hanyu and Rika being the only characters aware of this. This leads to the multiple plot lines that are independent, with the only common thread being Rika's murder by Takano's henchmen, which releases the disease on the village and wipes it out.

After several hundred loops, Keiichi becomes aware of them in a handful of flashbacks, and subconsciously remembers several of his past loops, which allows him to avoid several critical points where various characters would be murdered or driven insane, and the group of friends nearly manages to outwit Takano. In the final loop, the group asks Hanyu to join them, and the spirit manages to manifest a physical body. With her assistance, they manage to stay alive long enough to prevent Takano's plan. Hanyu travels back in time to alter Takano's past, saving her father's life and preventing her psychotic drive from forming.

===Story arcs===
In the ''Higurashi'' games, there are several [[story arc]]s, the original eight of which are referred to as either question arcs or answer arcs. The answer arcs generally recapitulate the events of the corresponding question arc, but from a different perspective, using the change of protagonist to solve various mysteries and come to a different conclusion. Each of the eight original games for the PC represented separate arcs of the overall storyline. Apart from the main question and answer relationship, the story of the arcs are not directly connected, although a multitude of parallels exist which allow the observant reader to gain extra insight into the mystery.

====Higurashi no Naku Koro ni====
The {{Nihongo|''Higurashi: When They Cry''|ひぐらしのなく頃に|Higurashi no Naku Koro ni}} games form what are referred to as the question arcs. These first four games of the series were meant to give the player a sense of the world where the story takes place and introduce the mysterious circumstances surrounding the village of Hinamizawa. Since there are no concrete answers given to the questions that the story presents in these arcs, the question arcs allow the player to form his or her own opinions about the events taking place in the village. Each question arc game contains all of the previous question arcs.

;{{Nihongo|''Onikakushi-hen''|鬼隠し編||"Demoned Away Chapter"}}
: The chapter introduces the player to the world of ''Higurashi no Naku Koro ni''. The player is shown the simple rural life of the village, the after-school club activities, and the friendships of the main characters. However, things take a sinister turn after the Watanagashi Festival, when Keiichi discovers what his new friends have been concealing from him. The chapter implies that Rena and Mion are the villains.

;{{Nihongo|''Watanagashi-hen''|綿流し編||"Cotton Drifting Chapter"}}
: The player should have an overall idea of how life in the village resembles. Once again, the chapter begins for the Watanagashi Festival again marking the start of the bad events. An ancient curse strikes and a pair of sisters are not what they seem. Shion Sonozaki makes her first appearance in the chapter, while Mion is portrayed as the villain.

;{{Nihongo|''Tatarigoroshi-hen''|祟殺し編||"Curse Killing Chapter"}}
: Keiichi and Satoko develop a brother-sister relationship. When Satoko's abusive uncle returns to the village, Keiichi attempts to help Satoko with drastic measures. However, as more people die, it is clear he is not the only one involved. The spotlight shines on Satoko Hojo as the "victim". The chapter implies that Keiichi is a villain.

;{{Nihongo|''Himatsubushi-hen''|暇潰し編||"Time Killing  Chapter"}}
:Five years before the first three chapters, [[Tokyo]] police investigator, Mamoru Akasaka, investigates a kidnapping of a politician's grandchild around the village. Soon, he too becomes implicated in the mysteries of the village. The chapter focuses on Rika Furude as being the key part of the mystery.

====Kai====
The {{Nihongo|''Higurashi: When They Cry Kai''|ひぐらしのなく頃に解|Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Kai|"When Cicadas Cry Solutions"}} games form what are known as the answer arcs. The last four games released in the series, were, in contrast to the question arcs, meant to answer all of the questions presented in the first half of the series. These arcs can be considered the "solutions" of the previous arcs. Each answer arc game contains all of the previous answer arcs.

;{{Nihongo|''Meakashi-hen''|目明し編||"Eye Opening Chapter"}}
:''Meakashi-hen'' is the answer arc corresponding to ''Watanagashi-hen''. The chapter consists of events very similar to those of ''Watanagashi-hen'' told from the perspective of Shion. After Satoshi kills his aunt, the chapter implies that Shion is a villain. 

;{{Nihongo|''Tsumihoroboshi-hen''|罪滅し編||"Atonement Chapter"}}
:''Tsumihoroboshi-hen'' is the answer arc corresponding to ''Onikakushi-hen''. Unlike ''Meakashi-hen'', ''Tsumihoroboshi-hen'''s story is drastically different from the plot of its question arc.  In ''Tsumihoroboshi-hen'', Rena experiences a situation similar to Keiichi's in ''Onikakushi-hen'', as she makes a terrible mistake and becomes distrustful of her former friends. It is the first chapter with a (seemingly) happy ending, although the tips reveal an evil twist.

;{{Nihongo|''Minagoroshi-hen''|皆殺し編||"Massacre Chapter"}}
:On the surface, ''Minagoroshi-hen'' is the solution to ''Tatarigoroshi-hen''; however, it answers most of the major common mysteries of the previous arcs.  It is told from the perspective of Rika Furude. Most notably, the true identity of the murderer is finally revealed in ''Minagoroshi-hen''. After ''Minagoroshi-hen'', one more effort is needed to seal the story into a happy ending.

;{{Nihongo|''Matsuribayashi-hen''|祭囃し編||"Festival Accompanying Chapter"}}
:With all pieces of the puzzle in place, it's up to the characters to join forces in order to defeat the culprit, obtain the miracle, and break through the barrier of June 1983. ''Matsuribayashi-hen'' is a "Good End" in which no major deaths occur in that June, although the deaths in previous years still occurred.

====Rei====
Three extra chapters were included in a fan disc named {{Nihongo|''Higurashi: When They Cry Rei''|ひぐらしのなく頃に礼|Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Rei|''When Cicadas Cry Gratitudes''}}, two of which were newly created.  ''Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Rei'' was released on December 31, 2006.

;{{Nihongo|''Saikoroshi-hen''|賽殺し編||"Dice Killing Chapter"}}
:''Saikoroshi-hen'' is an epilogue of ''Matsuribayashi-hen'', which takes place two months later in August 1983. Rika is apparently killed by a truck and wakes up in a different world, where none of the tragic events occurred in the main series: Keiichi is absent from the village, Rena's parents did not divorce, the dam project was resolved smoothly, Satoshi stays with Satoko and Rika's parents appeared. However, the club never formed, meaning Rika has no friends, she gets bullied by Satoko, Hanyū is absent, Rika is not revered as the reincarnation of Oyashiro, and the village will soon be submerged underwater. Rika has to choose between staying in that world or killing her own mother, which will enable her to leave that sinless world.

;{{Nihongo|''Batsukoishi-hen''|罰恋し編||"Penalty Loving Chapter"}}
: A slapstick dream story in which Keiichi and the Soul Brothers fight against the girls through the club punishment games. The chapter was originally an epilogue titled ''Otsukaresama'' which came with ''Meakashi-hen'', but it was deemed too irrelevant and silly and was removed from subsequent chapters.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

;{{Nihongo|''Hirukowashi-hen''|昼壊し編||"Daybreak Chapter"}}
:''Hirukowashi-hen'' is based on ''[[Higurashi Daybreak]]''. Keiichi and Rena spent time together, until Rena accidentally swallows something during her usual treasure hunting. According to Rika, the seal of the sacred "Fuwarazu Magatama" pairs was broken, and Rena had one of them. The [[magatama]] holds a mysterious magical powers in which a person that has the red magatama will blindly fall in love with anyone with the white one.

====Matsuri====
Three original chapters were created for the [[PlayStation 2]] version {{Nihongo|''Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Matsuri''|ひぐらしのなく頃に祭|When Cicadas Cry Festival}}, by [[Alchemist (company)|Alchemist]].

;{{Nihongo|''Taraimawashi-hen''|盥回し編||"Rotation Chapter"}}
: An alternate beginning chapter, at first glance, this additional "question arc" is a retelling of ''Onikakushi-hen''. However, this chapter, in fact, contains the events of ''Watanagashi-hen''. After learning the secrets of Hinamizawa, Keiichi decides to ignore everything and enjoy his peaceful school life; this action leads to a tragic series of events. Shion Sonozaki is the villain of the chapter, while Mion becomes the victim. Mion survives and is shown Rena's blood stained hat. Mion talks to Ooishi about the incident, but dies shortly after. The scenario is actually a "punishment", given when you deliberately try and avoid getting into any of the scenarios in the story (except one, as it is actually difficult to get into on purpose), and makes it clear to the player that they cannot simply avoid the tragedies around them and expect a happy ending.

;{{Nihongo|''Tsukiotoshi-hen''|憑落し編||"Exorcism Chapter"}}
: Although ''Tsukiotoshi-hen'' does not provide many answers since it relates what went wrong in ''Watanagashi-hen/Meakashi-hen'' and ''Tatarigoroshi-hen'', it is still considered an answer arc. In order to save Satoko, Shion, Keiichi and Rena decide to kill Teppei. But after the murder is done, Rena starts to act strangely, and Keiichi thinks he hears Oyashiro talking to him. Mion notices the change in her friends' behavior and takes Shion's place to find out why they are acting this way. Later on, Satoko develops Hinamizawa Syndrome and kills Shion, before killing herself.

;{{Nihongo|''Miotsukushi-hen''|澪尽し編||"Canal Drying Chapter"}}
:An alternate ending to the main series, the chapter name ''Miotsukushi'' is a pun of {{Nihongo|''Miotsukushi''|澪標|canal sign}} and {{Nihongo|''Mi o tsukushi''|身を尽くし}}, a conjugation of {{Nihongo|''Mi o tsukusu''|身を尽くす|serve one's body}}. The pun is known in Japanese poetry such as [[haiku]]. After finding out who the real murderer is, Rika and Keiichi decide to put an end to the whole mystery, but they are in a different situation than ''Matsuribayashi-hen''. Before they can do anything, they have to solve other people's problems first. The problems of ''Watanagashi/Meakashi-hen'', ''Tatarigoroshi-hen'', and ''Tsumihoroboshi-hen'' are met here, and all of them must be solved. The arc solves all the mysteries of the series, adds a few new ones, and gives the origins of both Hanyu and Hinamizawa syndrome. The story development of ''Miotsukushi-hen'' in the fourth Nintendo DS game ''Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Kizuna'' has slight differences from the original PlayStation 2 version. The conclusion of Tomoe's story, continued from the third DS game ''Rasen'', was added to ''Miotsukushi-hen'', but had no connection with the PlayStation 2 version ending.

====Kizuna====
Four original chapters were created for the [[Nintendo DS]] version {{Nihongo|''Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Kizuna''|ひぐらしのなく頃に絆|When Cicadas Cry Bonds}}, by [[Alchemist (company)|Alchemist]].

;{{Nihongo|''Someutsushi-hen''|染伝し編||"Dye Following Chapter"}}
: The new question arc reveals in ''Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Kizuna''. It seems to be a retelling of ''Onisarashi'' with new characters and a few minor differences. In this chapter, the events of ''Onisarashi'' play out with the exception of Tomoe added to the equation, and Akasaka and Oishi being absent, although Oishi is mentioned, resulting in a different ending. The major difference is that this chapter's ending is a "bad ending" instead of a "good ending" like in the original storyline, with Natsumi dying at the end instead of being saved by Akira.

;{{Nihongo|''Kagebōshi-hen''|影紡し編||"Silhouette Spinning Chapter"}}
:A new chapter in ''Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Kizuna Dai Ni Kan Sō''. The version of ''Onisarashi-hen'' is told through the eyes of Tomoe Minami, a policewoman that is investigating the strange occurrences happening all over Japan. Akasaka and Oishi are present in this chapter, as well as Tomoe's younger sister, who is also a police officer, and another male officer. The chapter has a "good ending" like the original manga chapter, but with different events causing it. Natsumi attacks Chisato, one of her friends, putting her in the hospital, where she later talks with Akasaka. After the seemingly unpreventable murder of Natsumi's family, Chisato meets Natsumi on the hospital roof, and after a little struggling, manages to calm Natsumi down, and comforts her.

;{{Nihongo|''Tokihogushi-hen''|解々し編||"Untangling Chapter"}}
: A new chapter in ''Higurashi no Naku Koro ni: Kizuna Rasen''. Tomoe Minai and her sister make another appearance, along with a new blue haired girl named Nagisa Ozaki. Oishi Kurado and Rena Ryugu return in this chapter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.famitsu.com/game/coming/1222204_1407.html|title=Nintendo DS Original Scenario and Dai's New Music in ''Higurashi no Naku Koro ni: Kizuna Rasen''|publisher=[[Famitsu]]|date=2009-02-21|accessdate=2009-03-10| language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The chapter explores Rena's past in Showa 57 (1982).

;{{Nihongo|''Kotohogushi-hen''|言祝し編||"Congratulating Chapter"}}
: A DS-exclusive chapter in the final installment of ''Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Kizuna Dai Yon Kan Kizuna''. The chapter explores Hanyu's past as Hainiryuun Ieasomuuru Jieda and the origin of Hinamizawa. Characters appeared in this arc such as Riku Furude, one of Rika's ancestor and the Shinto Priest of Furude House, who fell in love with Hainiryuun; and Ōka Furude, the child of Hainiryuun and Riku Furude.

====Manga arcs====
These side stories are original chapters serialized in manga form which supplement the games and partially continue the story.

;{{Nihongo|''Onisarashi-hen''|鬼曝し編||"Demon Exposing Chapter"}}
: In ''Onisarashi-hen'', a young girl named Natsumi is haunted by the aftermath of the Hinamizawa Disaster. Soon after her grandmother &amp;mdash; a former Hinamizawa resident &amp;mdash; tells her of Oyashiro's curse, Natsumi finds that her own hands have become covered in blood. Akasaka and Oishi also feature in the story. ''Onisarashi-hen'' was later included as part of the Nintendo DS remake ''Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Kizuna'' as ''Someutsuhi-hen'', with some changes.

;{{Nihongo|''Yoigoshi-hen''|宵越し編||"Beyond Midnight Chapter"}}
: This chapter is an epilogue of one of the "possible outcomes" of ''Tsumihoroboshi-hen'', in which Rena burned the school and killed Mion and her friends. Many years later, in 2006, the lock has been lifted and a group of five meet by coincidence, one of them claiming to be Mion, and get dragged into the supernatural aspects of the "Village of the Dead." Tips for this chapter can be read via mobile phone at Gangan Mobile. This chapter was included as part of ''Higurashi no Naku Koro Ni Kizuna: Dai-San-Kan Rasen'' for the Nintendo DS.

;{{Nihongo|''Utsutsukowashi-hen''|現壊し編||"Reality Breaking Chapter"}}
: A prequel to ''Meakashi-hen''. Shion is sent away to the all-girls school, St. Lucia Academy, for confinement. One day, a male teacher's body was found in the school swimming pool and the first discoverer, Mizuho Kōsaka, is summoned to the chairman's office to report the details. Shion hears rumors about how Mizuho's grandmother is after Mizuho's life and the girl is taking refuge in the school, so Shion approaches the aloof Mizuho. The chapter started serialization in the December 2006 issue of ''[[Comp Ace]]''.

;{{Nihongo|''Kataribanashi-hen''|語咄し編||"Anthology Chapter"}}
: A collection of reader submitted comics that were created into a story by Ryukishi 07.

;{{Nihongo|''Kokoroiyashi-hen''|心癒し編||"Heart-Healing Chapter"}}
: An epilogue to ''Matsuribayashi-hen'' where Rika and the others, including Hanyu, go on a summer vacation to heal their hearts, so to speak, after everything they have been through.

====Anime arc====
;{{Nihongo|''Yakusamashi-hen''|厄醒し編||"Disaster Awakening Chapter"}}
:The arc was introduced in the second anime series, airing before ''Minagoroshi-hen'' and ''Matsuribayashi-hen''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.famitsu.com/anime/news/2007/04/23/681,1177333769,70718,0,0.html|title=Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Kai anime arcs revealed|publisher=[[Famitsu]]|accessdate=2007-04-27|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was made by the request of [[Ryukishi07|Ryukishi 07]] to include important plot details that were left out from the first season so as to tie the two seasons together. The issue of Hinamizawa's secrets is resolved early in this scenario, allowing the other characters to attend school without further issue. The story is told from the perspective of Satoko as she grows increasingly concerned with Rika's odd behavior, including speaking with invisible Hanyu about her own inevitable murder, and her vain attempts to change her fate on her own. Satoko later undergoes a situation containing elements from ''Tatarigoroshi-hen'' and ''Taraimawashi-hen'', from discovering Rika's body to surviving the Great Hinamizawa Disaster, and dying in the hospital once she understands the secret behind Rika's murder.

==Development==
The ''Higurashi no Naku Koro ni'' series is the first [[visual novel]] series produced by [[07th Expansion]]. The game director and scenario writer for the series are [[Ryukishi07|Ryukishi 07]], who also drew all of the character illustrations. Background images were taken from photographs taken by Ryukishi07, his younger brother Yatazakura, and Kameya Mannendō. Programming was worked on by Yatazakura, who worked on the main structure, 4U who worked on the intermission and Tips, and BT who worked on the [[mini game]]s. The games were designed using the [[game engine]] [[NScripter]]. The music of ''Higurashi'' was provided by various music artists including both professionals and ''[[dōjin]]'' artists, including Dai, the composer of most of the music found in the [[#Kai|answer arcs]].

Ryukishi 07 wrote in 2004 how he was influenced by [[Key (company)|Key]]'s works during the planning of ''Higurashi no Naku Koro ni''.&lt;ref name="Ryukishi07-blog04"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://naderika.com/Cgi/log_cbbs/logcbbs.cgi?mode=red2&amp;namber=399&amp;no=1|title=Key's Essence is Actually...(Bitter Smile)|last=|first=|date=2004-07-09|website=|publisher=[[07th Expansion]]|language=Japanese|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007105605/http://naderika.com/Cgi/log_cbbs/logcbbs.cgi?mode=red2&amp;namber=399&amp;no=1|archive-date=2011-10-07|author=[[Ryukishi07]]|accessdate=2016-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ryukishi 07 played Key's games as a reference, among other visual novels, and analyzed them to figure out the reason why they were found to be so popular. He figured that the secret was due to how the stories would start with ordinary, enjoyable days, but then a sudden occurrence would happen to lead the player to cry due to the shock value. He used a similar model for the basis of ''Higurashi'' but instead of leading the player to cry, Ryukishi 07 wanted to scare the player with the addition of [[Horror fiction|horror]] elements. In this way, Ryukishi 07 wished to be in some way associated with Key who he described as a "masterpiece maker."&lt;ref name="Ryukishi07-blog04"/&gt;

In an interview in the December 2008 issue of [[Yen Press]]'s ''[[Yen Plus]]'' [[manga]] anthology, Ryukishi 07 stated that ''Higurashi'' had its origins from an unpublished theater script called {{Nihongo|''Hinamizawa Teiryūjo''|雛見沢停留所||lit. ''Hinamizawa Bus Stop''}} he had written a few years before the first ''Higurashi'' game was released.&lt;ref name="Yen-Plus-Int"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Alone in the Dark: An Interview with the Creators of ''Higurashi When They Cry''|author=Thompson, Jason|journal=[[Yen Plus]]|publisher=[[Yen Press]]|issue=December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; When he decided to rewrite the script and release it, he wanted to build upon "the contrast between a fun, ordinary life, and something terrifying and out of the ordinary." Ryukishi 07 was greatly influenced by the worlds of [[Seishi Yokomizo]] when developing the universe of ''Higurashi''. Ryukishi 07 had decided "early on to design the story so that the truth comes to light by looking at several overlapping stories," though he originally planned to release it as a single game due to initially believing he could finish the story in a single year.&lt;ref name="Yen-Plus-Int"/&gt;

The word ''higurashi'' is the name of a kind of [[cicada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kimoto.cc/ykk/semi.html|title='Semi', Cicadas|accessdate=2008-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Naku'' means {{Nihongo|"to make sound"|鳴く}}, specifically referring to those sounds made by non-human organisms. According to the original creator, [[Ryukishi07|Ryukishi 07]], the red Na (&lt;span style="color:red"&gt;な&lt;/span&gt;) in the logo is an official part of the title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://07th-expansion.net/Soft/Higurasi.htm|title=Ryukishi07's official ''Higurashi'' game website|accessdate=2006-12-27|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

People in Japan, who had bought all nine of the DVDs of the first season, had the chance to receive a special anime DVD entitled ''Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Gaiden Nekogoroshi-hen'', based on the short story that was given to those who had bought the manga.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bb.oyashirosama.com/web/news/index.htm|title=Oyashirosama.com on the special DVD|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|language=Japanese|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080621204917/http://bb.oyashirosama.com/web/news/index.htm|archive-date=2008-06-21|dead-url=yes|accessdate=2016-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite being a bonus for the first season (and having the first season's opening and closing sequences), ''Nekogoroshi-hen'' featured the updated animation style as seen in the second season.

==Music==
{{main|List of Higurashi no Naku Koro ni soundtracks}}
Unlike visual novels created by established companies, [[07th Expansion]] did not create the music found in the ''Higurashi'' games. The music for the question arcs consists of license free songs found on the Internet while the music for the answer arcs was provided by [[dōjin music]] artists that were fans of ''Higurashi''. Later, a CD album called ''[[List of Higurashi no Naku Koro ni soundtracks#Thanks/you|Thanks/you]]'' was released by the dōjin music artist, Dai; many of his tracks were used in the answer arcs. Fans initially referred to this album as the official soundtrack. However, the actual [[List of Higurashi no Naku Koro ni soundtracks#Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Kai Original Soundtrack|official soundtrack]] has since been released for the series, featuring a majority of the songs featured in the answer arcs. This two-disc set is, to date, the most complete collection of songs from the games.

The first season anime's opening theme is "[[List of Higurashi no Naku Koro ni soundtracks#Higurashi no Naku Koro ni|Higurashi no Naku Koro ni]]" sung by [[Eiko Shimamiya]]; it went on sale in Japan on May 24, 2006. The ending theme is "[[List of Higurashi no Naku Koro ni soundtracks#Why, or Why Not|Why, or Why Not]]" sung by [[Rekka Katakiri]]; it was released on June 28, 2006. There have been two [[List of Higurashi no Naku Koro ni soundtracks#Original soundtracks|original soundtracks]] released for the anime adaptation. The main composer for the tracks was Japanese [[composer]] [[Kenji Kawai]] and the albums were produced by [[Frontier Works]]. Volume 1 was released on July 21, 2006, and volume 2 was released on October 6, 2006, in Japan. Three character song CDs were also released, sung by [[seiyū|voice actors]] from the anime adaptation, between March 28 and July 25, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/B000N3SW7C/ |title=''Higurashi'' character CD Vol. 1 listing|publisher=[[Amazon.com|Amazon.co.jp]]|accessdate=2009-06-20|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/B000PWQQCY/ |title=''Higurashi'' character CD Vol. 3 listing|publisher=[[Amazon.com|Amazon.co.jp]]|accessdate=2009-06-20|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second season anime's opening theme is "Naraku no Hana" also sung by Shimamiya. The first season's opening theme includes a [[Backmasking|hidden message]] : the unintelligible lyrics at the beginning ("hanni hara hare hi") were generated by reversing the phrase {{Nihongo|''nigerarenain da''|逃げられないんだ||"there's no escape"}}. The second season's opening theme also includes a reversed part at the end ("ie hanann") which was made by playing backwards the reversed bit from the first opening theme. The ending theme is "Taishō a" performed by anNina. The first OVA season's opening theme is "Super scription of data" by Shimamiya, and the ending theme is {{Nihongo|"Manazashi"|まなざし}} by anNina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fwinc.boxerblog.com/production_diary/2008/10/ova20081023-652.html|title=OVA ''Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Rei'' Theme Song Information Revealed|last=|first=|date=2008-10-23|website=|publisher=|language=Japanese|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090206022646/http://fwinc.boxerblog.com/production_diary/2008/10/ova20081023-652.html|archive-date=2009-02-06|dead-url=yes|accessdate=2016-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The opening theme for the OVA ''Higurashi No Naku Koro Ni Kira'' is "Happy! Lucky! Dochy!" by [[Yukari Tamura]], [[Mika Kanai]], and [[Yui Horie]]—the voice actors for Rika, Satoko, and Hanyu, respectively. The ending theme, {{Nihongo|"Zendai Mimon Miracle Change"|前代未聞☆ミラクルチェンジ|Unprecedented Miracle Change}}, had four separate versions: one by [[Mai Nakahara]], Rena's voice actor and the others are sung by Yukari Tamura and Mika Kanai, [[Satsuki Yukino]], Mion and Shion's voice actor, and Yui Horie.

For the first live-action film, a short version of the film's theme song was released on December 22, 2007, in Japan. Once again, Shimamiya sang the song, entitled {{Nihongo|"Wheel of Fortune"|運命の輪|Unmei no Wa}}. Shimamiya also performed the ending theme entitled {{Nihongo|"Diorama"|ディオラマ}}.

Many fans attribute the game's success to the suspense and horror the novel portrays. Fan-based community boards emerged where fans began discussing their own theories.

He also praised the structure stating that the "mystery develops slowly" to immerse the reader in the characters and then later force the reader to "confront the possibility that one or more of them may be [the] murderer"; a decision he described as "clever".&lt;ref name="Colussy-Estes"/&gt; Critics criticized the manga for using "cliché" characterizations typical of the harem genre.&lt;ref name=Aoki/&gt;&lt;ref name="Colussy-Estes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Brienza 1"/&gt; However, Phil Guie of Popcultureshock expressed disappointment that this characterization "is brushed aside" for the horror as it gave the friendship between characters "real depth" adding to the surprise of the plot twists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.popcultureshock.com/manga/index.php/reviews/manga-reviews/manga-minis-42709/|title=Review Higurashi When They Cry: Abducted by Demons Arc, Vol. 2|last=Guie|first=Phil|date=2009-04-27|website=|publisher=Popcultureshock|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308062400/http://www.popcultureshock.com/manga/index.php/reviews/manga-reviews/manga-minis-42709/|archive-date=2012-03-08|dead-url=yes|accessdate=2016-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anime News Network]]'s Casey Brienza praised the manga for being an "effective" horror story as it follows an ordinary situation, a harem manga plot, which "becomes terrifying" producing an effect that is "trashy horror at its absolute greatest".&lt;ref name="Brienza 1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/higurashi/when-they-cry/gn-1 |last=Brienza |first=Casey |title=Review Higurashi: When They Cry GN 1 |publisher=[[Anime News Network]] |date=2009-01-04 |accessdate=2009-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, she expressed being frustrated by the end of the second volume as the central question remains "infuriatingly unanswered" though still felt the manga is "wholly enjoyable and satisfying" nonetheless.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/higurashi/when-they-cry/gn-2 |last=Brienza |first=Casey |title=Review Higurashi: When They Cry GN 2 |publisher=[[Anime News Network]] |date=2009-02-19 |accessdate=2009-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brienza stated that although the artwork is "average", the illustrator "seems to know exactly how to transition between the adorable and the abominable—and does so with dramatic, nightmarish effect."&lt;ref name="Brienza 1"/&gt; Aoki described the artwork as although "pander[ing] to otaku fetishes" containing "generic" and "awkward" character designs, providing "overbearing cutesiness [that] makes the secrets that the girls are hiding behind their smiles just that much creepier."&lt;ref name=Aoki/&gt;

===Anime===
A review of ''Higurashi: When they Cry'' by ''[[The Escapist (magazine)|The Escapist]]'' gave the anime a highly positive review. The reviewer, James Henley, praised the story, saying that each arc is interesting in its own way, but said that watching ''Kai'' was necessary to fully understand the story. He also praised the cast of characters, and how, despite having only one main male character, it never falls into harem stereotypes, and how each one has a unique back story, revealed in different arcs. He criticized the dub as poor quality, but recommended the anime, mainly subbed, if one "can stomach the brutality."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Henley, James|url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/editorials/reviews/anime/6503-Anime-Review-Higurashi-When-They-Cry|title=Anime Review: ''Higurashi: When They Cry''|publisher=[[The Escapist (magazine)|The Escapist]]|date=September 8, 2009|accessdate=February 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Anime Almanac'' similarly praised the story, as a unique method of storytelling and the art of the characters, but went to add that the "[[Moe (slang)|moe]]" design on the girls made the scary scenes less threatening. He ultimately recommended the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://animealmanac.com/2009/09/02/anime-review-higurashi-when-they-cry/|title=Anime Review: Higurashi – When They Cry|publisher=The Anime Almanac|date=September 2, 2009|accessdate=February 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another review, from ''T.H.E.M Anime'', was less positive, giving it 3 out of 5 stars, praising the story, but panning the sorrow of the characters and the violence, saying "''Higurashi'' is a hard show to watch; while it's interesting, each chapter is progressively soul-sucking and depressing, as the characters struggle desperately to avoid grisly fates, often to no avail, multiple times." He finished the review by saying "...''Higurashi'' is interesting and visceral enough to be worth viewing by the more adventurous."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.themanime.org/viewreview.php?id=1001|title=When They Cry - Higurashi|publisher=THEM Anime Reviews|accessdate=February 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''I, Libertine''''' was a [[literary hoax]] novel that began as a practical joke by late-night radio [[raconteur]] [[Jean Shepherd]].

==Creation of the hoax==
Shepherd was highly annoyed at the way that the [[bestseller]] lists were being compiled in the mid-1950s. These lists were determined not only from sales figures but also from the number of requests for new and upcoming books at bookstores. Shepherd urged his listeners to enter bookstores and ask for a book that did not exist. He fabricated the author (Frederick R. Ewing) of this imaginary novel, concocted a title (''I, Libertine''), and outlined a basic plot for his listeners to use on skeptical or confused bookstore clerks. Fans of the show eventually took it further, planting references to the book and author so widely that demand for the book led to it being listed on [[The New York Times Best Seller list|''The New York Times'' Best Seller list]].

==Publication==
Bookstores became interested in carrying Ewing's novel, which allegedly had been [[banned in Boston]]. When publisher [[Ian Ballantine]], novelist [[Theodore Sturgeon]], and Shepherd met for lunch, Ballantine hired Sturgeon to write a novel based on Shepherd's outline. [[Betty Ballantine]] completed the final chapter after Sturgeon fell exhausted asleep on the Ballantines' couch, having tried to meet the deadline in one marathon typing session. On September 13, 1956, [[Ballantine Books]] published ''I, Libertine'' simultaneously in hardcover and paperback editions with Shepherd seen looking as dissolute as possible, as Ewing, in the back cover author's photograph. The proceeds were donated to charity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.wfmu.org/freeform/2008/06/the-i-libertine.html An interview with Shepherd on the hoax from Long John Nebel's radio show] Long John Nebel's radio show&lt;/ref&gt;

A few weeks before publication, ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' exposed the hoax, already an [[open secret]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Henderson |first=Carter |title=Ballantine Books Makes Hoax Come True |url=//flicklives.com/Articles/Wall_Street_Journel/8-1-56/8-1-56.jpg |accessdate=27 February 2014 |newspaper=Wall Street Journal |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020427051336/http://flicklives.com/Articles/Wall_Street_Journel/8-1-56/8-1-56.jpg |archivedate=27 April 2002 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Plot===
Rife with jokes and wordplay, the novel can still be read as an entertaining historical romance.  It tells the story of a social climber who styles himself Lance Courtenay, and most of the plot is closely based on the historical personage [[Elizabeth Chudleigh]].  An afterword states "The story of Elizabeth Chudleigh is substantially true ... ." which could easily be taken as part of the hoax, but the deception is double, for the seemingly fantastic story of Elizabeth Chudleigh actually ''is'' true.&lt;ref&gt;T. H. White, ''The Age of Scandal'', Faber &amp; Faber, 2011, {{ISBN|978-0571274765}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cover painting===
The front cover displays a quote: "'Gadzooks,' quoth I, 'but here's a saucy bawd!'". The cover painting by [[Frank Kelly Freas]] includes hidden images and inside jokes: The sign on the tavern, Fish &amp; Staff, has a shepherd's staff and an image of a sturgeon, referencing both Sturgeon and Shepherd. A portion of the word often spoken on the air by Shepherd – "Excelsior!" – can be seen on the paperback cover in a triangular area at extreme left, where it is part of the decoration on the coach door. The hardcover dust jacket, with more of the illustration to the left, shows the entire word.

Though an insurance agent by trade, Gayle Evans has become the default cure-all for the small town, as her pleasant disposition and sound advice has made her a go-to resource in the lives of her clients. From a newlywed couple seeking weekly marital advice, to an overconfident plumber trying to protect his coveted identity, to a traveling hypnotist needing liability coverage, Gayle's clientele range from sympathetic to pathetic to outright bizarre.

=== Season 2 (2010) ===
In Season 2, Gayle's clientele range from sweet to sympathetic to outright bizarre. From first-time expecting parents needing baby advice, to a plumber-by-day-rock-star-by-night egomaniac, to a hair-brained hair stylist in need of small business insurance, Gayle's got her hands full. She becomes a friend, psychiatrist and advisor to the colorful and quirky locals of Maple Grove.

=== Season 3 (2011) ===
Returning from lunch on an idle Monday, Maple Grove insurance agent Gayle Evans is approached by a bombastic stranger. Theatrical and overly confident, Rafael reveals to Gayle that he’s oh so close to completing his first musical, Policies! Policies!, a love story about a small town insurance agent who helps his clients’ dreams come true. Rafael has arrived in the Midwestern hamlet to not only find inspiration from his muse, Gayle, but furthermore to stage the entire production in all of its grandeur before introducing Broadway to its next blockbuster smash hit.

We soon learn, however, that Rafael is not the gifted impresario he presents, but rather an insecure man with a half-baked script. Finding herself in the eye of the tornado, Gayle must now juggle clueless executive producers, a wannabe movie star, a melodramatic teen diva, an actor with paralyzing stage fright, an always bitter rival and many more roadblocks in her pursuit of protecting Rafael’s dream and helping it become fully realized. Will Gayle pull everyone together and make “Policies! Policies!” the crowd-pleasing, roof-raising hit Rafael always knew it could be?

'''''Infestation: Survivor Stories''''' (formerly known as '''''The War Z''''') was an [[open world]] [[Zombie (fictional)|zombie]] [[video game]] developed by Hammerpoint Interactive and published by OP Productions.&lt;ref name="developed"&gt;{{cite web|last=Gauntlett|first=Adam|title=Zombies Eat the World in The War Z MMO|url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/118614-Zombies-Eat-the-World-in-The-War-Z-MMO |publisher=Escapist Magazine |accessdate=October 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=IGN1&gt;{{cite web|last=Gallegos|first=Anthony |title=The War Z -- A New Zombie Survival Experience |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/07/19/the-war-z-a-new-zombie-survival-experience|publisher=IGN|accessdate=October 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Infestation: Survivor Stories'' features both first person and third person shooting perspectives. The game offers players the option of killing zombies or [[Player versus player|playing against other users]] (PvP).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Lahti |first=Evan |title=The War Z announced: zombie survival shooter-MMO with strong parallels to Day Z |url=http://www.pcgamer.com/2012/07/19/the-war-z-announced-zombie-survival-shooter-mmo-with-strong-parallels-to-day-z/ |publisher=PC Gamer |accessdate=October 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Infestation: Survivor Stories'' was able to be purchased and played online without the need for an [[Subscription business model|ongoing monthly subscription]] with free updates. Players could, however, purchase cosmetic and convenience items such as ammo, and other items that they would otherwise have to find in the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Zeidler|first=Brett|title=Zombie survival MMO The War Z to release this fall|url=http://www.destructoid.com/zombie-survival-mmo-the-war-z-to-release-this-fall-231729.phtml |publisher=Destructoid |accessdate=October 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Infestation: Survivor Stories'' had dedicated public servers accessible by all players in addition to player-purchased private servers.&lt;ref name=Patch02122013&gt;{{cite web |first=Kewk|title=Patch Notes 2/12/13 |url=http://forums.infestationmmo.com/showthread.php?115801-Patch-Notes-2-12-13 |publisher=OP Productions|accessdate=March 25, 2013}}{{dead link|date=September 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; A "spiritual successor" to the game, ''Romero's Aftermath'' was released by [[Free Reign Entertainment]] on September 25, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2015-03-27-infestation-survivor-stories-the-war-z-gets-a-reboot-with-romeros-aftermath |title= Infestation: Survivor Stories / The War Z gets a reboot with Romero's Aftermath |date=March 27, 2015 |accessdate= September 25, 2015 |work= Eurogamer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game was panned by critics and is considered one of the [[List of video games notable for negative reception|worst video games of all time]]. The game servers were taken offline on December 15, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://steamcommunity.com/games/226700/announcements/detail/341540564442771798|title=Steam Community :: Group Announcements :: Infestation: Survivor Stories Classic|website=steamcommunity.com|language=en|access-date=2017-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gameplay==
''Infestation: Survivor Stories'' was a zombie survival game where players endure the hardships of a post-apocalyptic, zombie-infested world. By collaborating with other players, and finding weapons and items, players increase their chances of survival. The game incorporated survival elements like hunger and thirst, which gradually grow over time. Supplies such as food and water could be found to battle the hunger and thirst. If the player failed to properly quench their hunger and thirst, the player's character would eventually die. It was possible to buy food and drinks if the player had none or choose not to scavenge for the items in the world. Items carried by the deceased character were lost on death - whether purchased in-game or not - but could be found and retrieved by other players, continuing the cycle of life and death in the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Interview: The War Z And Surviving A Zombie Apocalypse MMO |url=http://www.cinemablend.com/games/Interview-War-Z-Surviving-Zombie-Apocalypse-MMO-46683.html|publisher=Gaming Blend |accessdate=October 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Safe settlements or safe zones gave users an area where they were protected from combat and zombie attacks. There, players could access "Global Inventory" - an inventory shared between characters - and shop for items via the General Store.&lt;ref name=Patch02122013/&gt;

Outside the safe zones, players could engage in [[player versus player]] combat and [[player versus environment]] combat with zombies. Killing other players granted the [[user reputation]] based on the victims standing&lt;ref name=rep&gt;{{cite web|first=JonnyTruant|title=Reputation Explained|url=http://forums.infestationmmo.com/showthread.php?147169-Reputation-Explained|publisher=OP Productions|accessdate=March 25, 2013}}{{dead link|date=June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a chance to collect their dropped items, whereas killing zombies granted the user [[experience points]] for use in the game's [[skill tree]].&lt;ref name=Patch03042013&gt;{{cite web|first=Kewk |title=Patch Notes 3/4/13 |url=http://forums.infestationmmo.com/showthread.php?134211-Patch-notes-1-1-1-3-4-13 |publisher=OP Productions |accessdate=March 25, 2013}}{{dead link|date=June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
''Infestation: Survivor Stories'' was developed originally under the name ''The War Z'' by OP Productions.&lt;ref name="developed"/&gt;
''The War Z'' began its open alpha on October 15, 2012&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Mitchell |first=Richard |title=The War Z closed beta starts on Halloween, pre-orders get in early|url=http://www.joystiq.com/2012/10/04/the-war-z-closed-beta-starts-on-halloween-pre-orders-get-in-ear/ |publisher=Joystiq |accessdate=October 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was fully released on [[Steam (software)|Steam]] December 17, 2012. Two days after the launch, the game was removed from Steam due to false advertising; several features listed in the store description were not available in the game.&lt;ref name="bbc - 1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Player complaints drive zombie game off Steam|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-20796455 |publisher=BBC News|accessdate=December 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; After rectifying the issue, ''The War Z'' was again made available for purchase on Steam on February 26, 2013.&lt;ref name="warz back"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://store.steampowered.com/news/10024/|title=The War Z Now Available for Purchase |work=[[Steam (software)|Steam]] |publisher=[[Valve Corporation]] |date=February 26, 2013 |accessdate=February 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game has since been panned by critics and has been cited as one of the [[List of video games notable for negative reception#The War Z (PC)|worst video games ever made]]. 
On April 4, 2013, the [[source code]] of ''The War Z'' became available,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ragezone.com/2013/04/12/the-war-z-source-code/ |title=The War Z Source Code released.

On June 20, 2013, the game's name was officially changed to ''Infestation: Survivor Stories'' due to trademark problems.&lt;ref name="newname"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/125206-The-War-Z-Picks-Up-A-Brand-New-Title | title=The War Z Picks Up A Brand New Title | accessdate=June 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

===Alpha reception===
A reviewer for PC World stated that "overall, the game looks terrific" and had the "typical alpha bugs" of an alpha release, with the game holding promise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cocilova|first=Alex|title=Hands-on with The War Z|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/2010276/hands-on-with-the-war-z.html |publisher=PC World |accessdate=October 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A reviewer for [[Joystiq]] praised the character personalization, saying there were more options than they expected and the gameplay would be easy for experienced gamers to understand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hindman|first=Beau|title=GDC Online 2012: A (severed) hands-on with The War Z|url=http://massively.joystiq.com/2012/10/12/gdc-online-2012-a-severed-hands-on-with-the-war-z/|publisher=Joystiq|accessdate=October 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another reviewer for Joystiq commented that one of the game's biggest dangers comes from other players, with the game currently not having any rules or policing regarding the PvP element and hacking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hinkle|first=David|title=The War Z makes it easy to tell your own story|url=http://www.joystiq.com/2012/09/24/the-war-z-makes-it-easy-to-tell-your-own-story/|publisher=Joystiq|accessdate=October 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On release, the game was universally panned by critics. Aggregate review website [[Metacritic]] assigned an overall score of 20 out of 100 based on reviews from 13 professional critics.&lt;ref name="MC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/the-war-z|title=The War Z|work=[[Metacritic]]|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|accessdate=March 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[GameSpy]] writer Craig Pearson stated that the game "displays astonishing design ineptitude and some of the worst kinds of microtransactions in gaming, all in one ugly package".&lt;ref name="GSpy - review"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.pc.gamespy.com/pc/the-war-z/1227010p1.html|title=The War Z Review|publisher=[[GameSpy]]|first=Craig|last=Pearson|date=December 21, 2012|accessdate=December 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eurogamer]]'s Rich Stanton gave it 3 out of 10, calling it "a real disaster" and criticized both the game's design and the developer's ethics.&lt;ref name="eurog - review"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-01-02-the-war-z-review|title=The War Z review|publisher=[[Eurogamer]]|first=Rich|last=Stanton|date=January 2, 2013|accessdate=January 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stanton elaborated that the developers were "both dishonest and incompetent."&lt;ref name="eurog - review"/&gt; ''PCPowerplay'' gave the game a zero (out of ten), the only zero in the magazine's history.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

Despite the negativity, ''Infestation: Survivor Stories'' has sold 2.8 million copies since the game launched in November 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2015-01-15-the-war-z-sold-2-8m-copies-despite-dismal-reception?|title=The War Z sold 2.8m copies despite dismal reception|author=Jeffrey Matulef|work=[[Eurogamer]]|date=January 15, 2015|accessdate=January 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Controversies===
In October 2012, executive producer Sergey Titov referred to [[Spawn camping#Spawn camping|spawn campers]] in ''The War Z'' as "[[Faggot (slang)|faggots]]" in a forum post.&lt;ref name="Gspot - camper"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.gamespot.com/news/the-war-z-producer-calls-campers-fgots-6398729|title=The War Z producer calls campers f**gots|publisher=[[GameSpot]]|first=Eddie|last=Makuch|date=October 23, 2012|accessdate=December 24, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130115032753/http://uk.gamespot.com/news/the-war-z-producer-calls-campers-fgots-6398729|archivedate=January 15, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; A representative of the game's press team issued a statement saying that Titov has no prejudice against homosexuals and that it was just a poor and inappropriate choice of words.&lt;ref name="Gspot - camper"/&gt;

On November 15, 2012, the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] (USPTO) sent a letter to the game's publisher and developer stating that the request to trademark the name ''The War Z'' had been suspended.&lt;ref name="GSpy - trademark"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.pc.gamespy.com/pc/the-war-z/1227023p1.html|title=The War Z Might Have to Change Its Name|publisher=[[GameSpy]]|first=Brian|last=Mardiney|date=December 23, 2012|accessdate=December 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cause of the suspension was the close resemblance of the game's name to the title of [[Paramount Pictures]]' upcoming film ''[[World War Z (film)|World War Z]]''.&lt;ref name="GSpy - trademark"/&gt; On December 24, 2012, Titov responded by saying that he doesn't think that the trademark has been suspended even though the USPTO lists it as suspended.&lt;ref name="kotaku - trademark"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/5971099/war-z-creator-says-his-games-trademark-wasnt-suspended|title=War Z Creator Says His Game’s Trademark Wasn’t Suspended|publisher=Kotaku|first=Jason|last=Schreier|date=December 24, 2012|accessdate=December 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 17, 2012, Hammerpoint Interactive launched the "foundation release" of the game on [[Valve Corporation|Valve]]'s [[digital distribution]] platform [[Steam (software)|Steam]].&lt;ref name="finance yahoo"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hammerpoint-interactive-launches-foundation-release-002200080.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130713065916/https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hammerpoint-interactive-launches-foundation-release-002200080.html|archivedate=July 13, 2013|title=Hammerpoint Interactive Launches Foundation Release of The War Z on Steam|publisher=[[Yahoo! Finance]]|date=December 17, 2012|accessdate=December 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sergey Titov stated in a press release “Now that we’ve reached the Foundation Release milestone we will continue to work, as promised, to add features and content that will satisfy our community and keep them playing.”&lt;ref name="finance yahoo"/&gt; The developer was accused of attempting to get customers to buy the game directly from their website rather than Steam's platform by claiming that they would be raising the price of the game on Steam.&lt;ref name="destructoid - 1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.destructoid.com/the-war-z-launches-on-steam-amid-accusations-of-fraud-240814.phtml|title=The War Z launches on Steam amid accusations of fraud |publisher=[[Destructoid]] |first=Jim |last=Sterling |date=December 18, 2012 |accessdate=December 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the game's release, many customers accused the developers of fraud because of key features that were advertised but not featured in the game.&lt;ref name="bbc - 1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="destructoid - 1"/&gt; The game was initially described on Steam by the developers as containing certain features, such as multiple large game worlds varying in size, a skill point based leveling system, [[player versus environment]] combat, hundred-player servers, and private servers, none of which were a part of the game at the time.&lt;ref name="bbc - 1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gamespy - 1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pc.gamespy.com/pc/the-war-z/1226980p1.html|title=A Shocking Interview With The War Z Developer On False Steam Store Claims|publisher=[[GameSpy]]|first=Dan|last=Stapleton|date=December 18, 2012|accessdate=December 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Steam page was updated within 24 hours of release, but still mentioned features not yet in the game.&lt;ref name="gamespy - 1"/&gt;  Titov defended the way the information was presented by stating that the map size and player limits fell within the ranges shown, e.g., "Size of the area, once again, come on—[the] first map is over 100 sq km. So [the] text is right."&lt;ref name="gamespy - 1"/&gt; However, an independent analysis by PCGamesN.com estimated the actual map size at just under 10 sq km.&lt;ref name="pcgamesn"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcgamesn.com/how-big-war-zs-map|title=How big is The War Z's map?|publisher=PCGamesN.com|first=Steve|last=Hogarty|date=December 19, 2012|accessdate=March 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Titov also claimed that players had misread the information about the game's features on the store's page.&lt;ref name="gamespy - 1"/&gt; The game was then pulled from Steam entirely and any customer who purchased the game during the initial sale of the game was eligible to receive a full refund from Steam, an almost unheard of move by Valve.&lt;ref name="shack news"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shacknews.com/article/78005/the-war-z-back-on-steam-refund-offer-ends|title=The War Z back on Steam, refund offer ends|publisher=[[Shack News LTD]]|date=February 27, 2013|accessdate=July 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting with the epic 100th (collective) issue of the Tick (released summer 2012), a new crossover with a popular indie comic superhero is featured per issue.
Issue #100 found the Tick meeting Invincible [created by Robert Kirkman] and had a certain sidekick suffer a tragic death. 
The next issue #101 (released October 2012) found the Tick meeting Madman [created by Mike Allred] through more eccentric sci-fi plot devices allowing for the crossover. 
In May 2013 an all-new FCBD (Free Comic Book Day) issue with three all new stories (presumably, taking place right before issue 100's events) were given out at comic shops. Then in May 2014 another all-new FCBD issue was given out. Also in 2014, an extremely limited edition NEC Comic-Con issue was released, only 750 issues were produced. In May 2015 a new FCBD issue was released. And again in 2016 another new FCBD issue was unleashed. Most recently, on November 19th 2016, as part of Local Comic Shop Day, a special Tick issue was released. Currently, The Tick issue #102 has yet to be released, it is still set for a presumed TBD 2016/2017 release and will feature yet another heroic (and possibly final) crossover.

Ben Edlund drew a two-page comic strip for Fox Totally Kids magazine to promote The Tick animated series in the fall of 1995. 

[[The Tick]] made a cameo appearance in ''[[Shi (comics)|Shi]]/[[Cyblade]]'' 1, released September 1995.

[[The Tick]] made a cameo appearance in the daily comic strip [[Luann (comic strip)|Luann]] as Luann's brother, Brad, contemplates several of his favorite super-heroes.

[[The Tick]] is referenced in an issue of [[Deadpool]]. Deadpool leaps from a plane to attack [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] and screams a nonsensical phrase. He then jokingly asks the readers if they were expecting him to say Spoon (the Tick's catchphrase).

'''''Luceafărul''''' (originally spelled ''Luceafĕrul''; variously rendered as "The Morning Star", "The Evening Star", "The Vesper", "The Daystar", or "Lucifer") is a [[narrative poem]] by Romanian author [[Mihai Eminescu]]. It was first published in [[1883 in poetry|1883]], out of [[Vienna]], by Romanian expatriates in [[Austria-Hungary]]. It is generally considered Eminescu's masterpiece, one of the greatest accomplishments in [[Romanian literature]], and one of the last milestones in Europe's [[Romantic poetry]]. One in a family or "constellation" of poems, it took Eminescu ten years to conceive, its final shape being partly edited by the philosopher [[Titu Maiorescu]]. During this creative process, Eminescu distilled [[Romanian folklore]], Romantic themes, and various staples of [[Proto-Indo-European religion|Indo-European myth]], arriving from a versified fairy tale to a [[mythopoeia]], a self-reflection on his condition as a genius, and an illustration of his [[philosophy of love]].

The eponymous celestial being, also referred to as "[[Hyperion (mythology)|Hyperion]]", is widely identified as Eminescu's [[alter ego]]; he combines elements of [[fallen angel]]s, ''[[Daemon (classical mythology)|daimons]]'', ''[[Incubus|incubi]]'', but is neither mischievous nor purposefully seductive. His daily mission on the [[firmament]] is interrupted by the lustful calls of Princess Cătălina, who asks for him to "glide down" and become her mate. He is persuaded by her to relinquish his immortality, which would require approval from a third protagonist, the [[Demiurge]]. The Morning Star seeks the Demiurge at the [[edge of the Universe]], but only receives a revelation of mankind's irrelevancy. In his brief absence, the Princess is seduced by a fellow mortal. As he returns to his place in the sky, Hyperion understands that the Demiurge was right.

''Luceafărul'' enjoys fame not just as a poetic masterpiece, but also as one of the very last works completed and read publicly by Eminescu before his debilitating mental illness and hospitalization. It has endured in cultural memory as both the object of critical scrutiny and a strong favorite of the public. Its translators into various languages include figures such as [[Günther Deicke]], [[Zoltán Franyó]], [[Mite Kremnitz]], [[Leon Levițchi]], [[Mate Maras]], [[Corneliu M. Popescu]], [[David Samoylov]], [[Immanuel Weissglas]], [[Todur Zanet]], and [[Vilém Závada]]. The poem left a distinct legacy in literary works by [[Mircea Eliade]], [[Emil Loteanu]], [[Alexandru Vlahuță]], and, possibly, [[Ingeborg Bachmann]]. It has also inspired composers [[Nicolae Bretan]] and [[Eugen Doga]], as well as various visual artists.

==Outline==
''Luceafărul'' opens as a typical fairy tale, with a variation of "[[once upon a time]]" and a brief depiction of its female character, a "wondrous maiden", the only child of a royal couple—her name, Cătălina, will only be mentioned once, in the poem's 46th stanza. She is shown waiting impatiently for nightfall, when she gazes upon the Morning Star:
{{Verse translation|lang=ro
|
Din umbra falnicelor bolți
Ea pasul și-l îndreaptă
Lângă fereastră, unde-n colț
Luceafărul așteaptă.

Privea în zare cum pe mări
Răsare și străluce,
Pe mișcătoarele cărări
Corăbii negre duce.
|
From 'neath the castle's dark retreat,
Her silent way she wended,
Each evening to the window seat
Where Lucifer attended.

And secretly, with never fail,
She watched his gracious pace,
Where vessels drew their pathless trail
Across the ocean's face.
}}&lt;small&gt;—''translation by [[Corneliu M. Popescu]],&lt;br&gt;quoted in Kenneth Katzner, ''The Languages of the World'', p. 113. London etc.: [[Routledge]], 2002.  {{ISBN|0-415-25004-8}}''&lt;/small&gt;

Hyperion senses her attention and gazes back, and, although a [[non-physical entity]], also begins to desire her company. Sliding through her window when she is asleep, he caresses Cătălina as she dreams of him. In one such a moment, she moans for him to "glide down upon a ray" and become her betrothed. Urged on by this command, the Morning Star hurls himself into the sea, reemerging as a "fair youth", or "handsome corpse with living eyes".

Returning to Cătălina while she is awake, Hyperion proposes that they elope to his "coral castles" at the bottom of the sea; this horrifies the Princess, who expresses her refusal of a "lifeless" and "alien" prospect—although she still appears bedazzled by his "angel" looks. However, within days she returns to dreaming of the Morning Star and unconsciously asking for him to "glide down". This time, he appears to her a creature of fire, offering Cătălina a place in his celestial abode. She again expresses her refusal, and compares Hyperion's new form to that of a ''[[Daemon (classical mythology)|daimon]]''. In this restated form, her refusal reads:
{{Verse translation|lang=ro
|
— „O, ești frumos, cum numa-n vis
Un demon se arată,
Dară pe calea ce-ai deschis
N-oi merge niciodată [...]”
|
"You are as handsome as in sleep
Can but a d[a]emon be;
Yet never shall I take and keep
The path you show to me."
}}&lt;small&gt;—''translation by [[Leon Levițchi]], in Prickett, p. 237 (using "daemon"); in Săndulescu, p. 16 (has "demon").&lt;/small&gt;

Cătălina is not interested in acquiring immortality, but asks that he join the mortal realm, to be "reborn in sin"; Hyperion agrees, and to this end abandons his place on the [[firmament]] to seek out the Demiurge. This requires him to travel to the [[edge of the Universe]], into a [[cosmic void]]. Once there, the Demiurge laughs off his request; he informs Hyperion that human experience is futile, and that becoming human would be a return to "yesterday's eternal womb". He orders Hyperion back to his celestial place, obliquely telling him that something "in store" on Earth will prove the point.

Indeed, while Hyperion was missing, Cătălina had found herself courted, then slowly seduced, by a "conniving" [[Page (servant)|courtly page]], Cătălin. The poem's "tragic [[denouement]] allots each of the three lovers their own sphere with frontiers impossible to trespass."&lt;ref&gt;Prickett, p. 231&lt;/ref&gt; As he resumes his place on the firmament, Hyperion catches sight of the happy couple Cătălin and Cătălina. She gazes back and calls on him, but only as a witness to, and good-luck charm for, her new love. The last two stanzas show Hyperion returning to his silent, self-absorbed, activities:
{{Verse translation|lang=ro
|
Dar nu mai cade ca-n trecut
În mări din tot înaltul
— „Ce-ți pasă ție, chip de lut,
Dac-oi fi eu sau altul?

Trăind în cercul vostru strâmt
Norocul vă petrece,
Ci eu în lumea mea mă simt
Nemuritor și rece.”
|
Yet he no more, as yesterday,
Falls down into the sea;
"What dost thou care, o shape of clay,
If it is I or he?

You live accompanied by weal
In your all-narrow fold,
Whilst in my boundless world I feel
Both deathless and dead cold."
}}&lt;small&gt;—''translation by Levițchi, in Prickett, p. 249; in Săndulescu, p. 25.&lt;/small&gt;

==Publication history==
As noted by the editor [[Perpessicius]], during the interwar a "most absurd" urban legend had spread, according to which Eminescu had written the poem on the night train taking him to [[Bucharest]].&lt;ref&gt;Perpessicius, pp. 274, 290, 317, 434&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, several drafts of the poem exists, some as long as the finished piece. Perpessicius rates these as "standalone types" and, in 1938, opted to publish them as separate pieces in his companion to Eminescu's work,&lt;ref&gt;Perpessicius, pp. 297, 388&lt;/ref&gt; with philologist [[Petru Creția]] calling them the "''Luceafărul'' constellation".&lt;ref name="apnopții"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Antonio Patraș]], [http://convorbiri-literare.ro/?p=3914 "Eminescu, poet al nopții. Lecturi în palimpsest"], in ''[[Convorbiri Literare]]'', February 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Its earliest recognizable component is ''Fata-n grădina de aur'' ("Girl in the Garden of Gold"), written ca. 1873, when Eminescu was in [[Berlin]]. It was the ''[[ottava rima]]'' version of [[Romanian folklore]] prose-piece—retrieved by the [[Silesia]]n Richard Kunisch and published in 1861 ''Das Mädchen im goldenen Garten''.&lt;ref&gt;Caracostea, pp. 36, 45–74, 77–80, 90, 96–132, 137–139, 196–197; Perpessicius, pp. 207–210, 232–233, 276–278, 297. See also Bucur, pp. 454–458; Culianu, pp. 73–74; Gerota, pp. 378–379; Kernbach, p. 325; Lovinescu (1943), pp. 211–212; Marin, pp. 45–46&lt;/ref&gt; The source was cryptically identified as "the German K." in Eminescu's notebooks, and the bibliographic information was pieced together by [[Moses Gaster]].&lt;ref&gt;Caracostea, pp. 49–50, 105&lt;/ref&gt; 

Entire portions of the later poem also surface in another piece of the period. Called ''Peste codri stă cetatea'' ("Over the Woods There Stands a City"), it briefly depicts the Princess dreaming of her chosen one, the Morning Star.&lt;ref&gt;Perpessicius, pp. 217–219&lt;/ref&gt; Eminescu made several discreet returns to his drafts, adding the central theme of the Hyperion as a misunderstood genius, and finally in April 1882 went public with ''Legenda Luceafĕrului'' ("Legend of the Morning Star").&lt;ref&gt;Perpessicius, pp. 200, 207–208, 241–242, 246, 276–278. See also Caracostea, pp. 124–149, 172–195&lt;/ref&gt; He was in Bucharest as a guest of the ''[[Junimea]]'' society, where he read out the variant on April 17; he then worked closely with its doyen [[Titu Maiorescu]], who helped him with critical insight. During these exchanges, the work acquired its celebrated final stanza.&lt;ref&gt;Perpessicius, pp. 104, 208, 241–242, 273–274, 277–278&lt;/ref&gt; There followed a second reading on April 24, when, in his diaries, Maiorescu recorded the "beautiful legend" simply as ''Luceafărul''.&lt;ref&gt;Lovinescu (1943), pp. 196–197, 212; Perpessicius, p. 241&lt;/ref&gt; 

Maiorescu endorsed the work and promoted it with public readings in both Bucharest and [[Buftea]], lasting into January 1883, and attended by Eminescu, [[Petre P. Carp]], [[Alexandru B. Știrbei]], and [[Ioan Slavici]].&lt;ref&gt;Lovinescu (1943), pp. 69–70, 197, 212. See also Constantinescu, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; First published in ''Almanachulŭ Societății Academice Socialŭ-Literare Romănia Jună'', put out by the [[Romanians in Austria|Romanian colony]] of [[Vienna]] in April 1883, it was taken up in August by the ''Junimist'' tribune, ''[[Convorbiri Literare]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Perpessicius, pp. 262, 265, 273, 278, 353, 382, 383; Săndulescu, p. 25. See also Caracostea, pp. 124, 215–216; Lovinescu (1943), p. 230&lt;/ref&gt; At some point in this interval, Eminescu had fallen terminally ill, and was sent to an [[Oberdöbling]] asylum for treatment. Around November 1883, as he began work on a first edition of Eminescu's collected poems, Maiorescu decided to cut out four stanzas—those detailing negotiations between Hyperion and Demiurge—, in an effort to improve flow.&lt;ref&gt;Perpessicius, pp. 71, 264–265, 271–273, 278, 351, 353–354, 374. See also Caracostea, pp. 215–218; Lovinescu (1943), p. 230&lt;/ref&gt; This puzzled later editors: in his own volume, [[Garabet Ibrăileanu]] kept the omission, but included the missing part as an appendix,&lt;ref&gt;Perpessicius, p. 374&lt;/ref&gt; while D. R. Mazilu hesitated between the versions in his search for an "ideal" and "purified" ''Luceafărul''.&lt;ref&gt;Bucur, pp. 381–382&lt;/ref&gt;

Running at 392 lines in its unabridged version, ''Luceafărul'' alternates [[iambic tetrameter]] and [[iambic trimeter]]. This is an old pattern in Romanian poetry, having been noted for instance in [[Dosoftei]]'s preamble to ''[[Erofili]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Ion C. Chițimia, "Școala ardeleană. Începuturile literaturii române moderne", in [[Alexandru Dima]], Ion C. Chițimia, [[Paul Cornea]], Eugen Todoran (eds.), ''Istoria literaturii române. II: De la Școala Ardeleană la Junimea'', p. 25. Bucharest: [[Editura Academiei]], 1968&lt;/ref&gt; and is described by critic [[Alex. Ștefănescu]] as "lapidary, enunciative, solemn in its simplicity."&lt;ref name="așlcf"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Alex. Ștefănescu]], [http://www.romlit.ro/index.pl/despre_luceafrul "Despre Luceafărul"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 34/2015&lt;/ref&gt; The rhythmic sequencing has created a long-standing dilemma about the intended pronunciation of ''Hyperion'': while common [[Romanian phonology]] favors ''Hypérion'', the text suggests that Eminescu used ''Hyperión''.&lt;ref&gt;Calotă, pp. 12–15&lt;/ref&gt; [[Artistic license]] also surfaces in the apparent [[pleonasm]], with which Cătălina beckons Hyperion: ''Cobori în jos, luceafăr blând'' ("Descend down, gentle Morning Star"). Some Eminescu exegetes see here an intellectual stress on the separation between the realms, breached by "divine descent into humanity",&lt;ref name="icchc"&gt;{{ro icon}} Ilie Constantin, [http://www.romlit.ro/index.pl/ctlina_hyperion_ctlin "Cătălina, Hyperion, Cătălin"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 1/2000&lt;/ref&gt; or the repetition one associates with [[incantation]].&lt;ref name="așlcf"/&gt;

==Themes and allusions==
===Mythology===
The versified story is so indebted to folklore that, according to Perpessicius, it should be published alongside those works of folk poetry which Eminescu himself collected and kept.&lt;ref&gt;Perpessicius, pp. 218, 232–233, 276–278, 297–298, 309–310, 422&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the same author concedes that Eminescu ultimately "fashioned his own ornaments" from the folkloric level, producing an "intensely original" work. These "ornaments" include: "the iambic rhythms of his stanzas, the images, the enchanting celestial voyage, the dialogue between Hyperion and the Demiurge, [and Cătălin], who seems to have been lifted out of a subtle comedy by [[Marivaux]]".&lt;ref&gt;Perpessicius, p. 208&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, critic C. Gerota sees Eminescu's poem as a "great work of art" emerging "from Kunisch's prosaic fairy tale"; "only the form" is folkloric.&lt;ref&gt;Gerota, pp. 378–379, 384&lt;/ref&gt; An [[Aarne–Thompson classification systems|Aarne–Thompson inventory]], proposed by the scholar [[Dumitru Caracostea]], finds that Eminescu essentially refashioned the myth of ''Animal Bride''. The fairy or ''[[Samodiva (mythology)|samodiva]]'' became the ''[[Daemon (classical mythology)|daimon]]''—within a narrative rearranged by Eminescu and, to some extent, by Kunisch.&lt;ref&gt;Caracostea, pp. 66–74, 77–93, 96–107&lt;/ref&gt; Caracostea rejects as too narrow the interpretations advanced by [[Gheorghe Bogdan-Duică]], according to whom ''Luceafărul'' was directly inspired by [[Lithuanian mythology]]—namely, by the story of [[Saulė]]'s revenge on [[Aušrinė]].&lt;ref&gt;Caracostea, pp. 83–86, 90–93&lt;/ref&gt;

In various ways, ''Luceafărul'' has connections with the [[fallen angel]] motif in [[Christian mythology]]. Mythographer Victor Kernbach notes that the name was already used in folkloric sources for [[Lucifer|the demon Lucifer]], or for a localized version of [[Samyaza]].&lt;ref&gt;Kernbach, pp. 325–326, 404&lt;/ref&gt; As described by the Eminescu scholar Gisèle Vanhese, ''Luceafărul'' is not just "Eminescu's masterpiece", but also "the achievement of Romantic reflection regarding the Sons of Darkness."&lt;ref&gt;Vanhese, p. 180&lt;/ref&gt; The latter category of folkloric beings, themselves probably derived from fallen angels,&lt;ref&gt;Caracostea, pp. 87–88; Culianu, pp. 71–76; Vanhese, pp. 179–180&lt;/ref&gt; includes the ''[[Zburătorul|Zburători]]'', which act as the Romanian equivalent of ''[[Incubus|incubi]]''. Their visitation of young girls at night also echoes more distant themes from [[Ancient Greek mythology]], such as [[Zeus]]' seduction of [[Semele]] and [[Io (mythology)|Io]], or the story of [[Cupid and Psyche]]—the latter was one of Eminescu's favorite references.&lt;ref&gt;Caracostea, pp. 75–83, 96&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Zburători''{{'}}s most elaborate depiction in [[Romantic poetry]] was an eponymous 1830s piece by [[Ion Heliade Rădulescu]],&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, pp. 289–290; Caracostea, p. 76&lt;/ref&gt; but they also show up in the works of [[Constantin Stamati]] and [[Constantin Negruzzi]].&lt;ref name="apnopții"/&gt; 

Variations of the theme, and more direct echoes from [[Lord Byron]] (''[[Heaven and Earth (drama)|Heaven and Earth]]'')&lt;ref&gt;Caracostea, pp. 87–88&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Victor Hugo]] ("The Sylph"),&lt;ref name="apnopții"/&gt; appear in various early poems by Eminescu, and in some portions of the "constellation". ''Zburători'' are directly mentioned in the draft poem ''Peste codri stă cetatea''—although, in later intermediary versions, the ''incubus'' had been a ''[[Zmeu]]'', and the Demiurge had been called "[[Adonai]]".&lt;ref&gt;Caracostea, pp. 185–186; Perpessicius, pp. 218–219, 277–278. See also Culianu, pp. 75–76&lt;/ref&gt; As seen by Vanhese, the Morning Star is a syntheses of ''incubi'' (he appears to Cătălina in her dreams) and Lucifer (with whom he shares the celestial attribute).&lt;ref name="apnopții"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vanhese, pp. 180–185&lt;/ref&gt; She argues that, with Eminescu's poem, "the myth of the Romantic demon reaches its most accomplished expression in European culture", equaled in visual arts by [[Mikhail Vrubel]]'s ''Demon Seated''.&lt;ref name="apnopții"/&gt;

This contrasts readings by Caracostea and [[Tudor Vianu]], who see the Morning Star as primarily angelic—if he appears "handsome as a daemon" during his second incarnation, it is because passion has momentarily transfigured him.&lt;ref&gt;Caracostea, pp. 93–95&lt;/ref&gt; Constantinescu assumes a similar stance, whereby the ''daimon'' is "pacified by the supreme awareness of his superior essence."&lt;ref&gt;Constantinescu, p. 136&lt;/ref&gt; While noting that Eminescu had a great interest in Lucifer as a literary trope, mythographer [[Ioan Petru Culianu]] asserts that the Morning Star is only incidentally related to the fallen angels myth, and more than anything a Romanian [[Hesperus]].&lt;ref&gt;Culianu, pp. 32, 67–76, 81, 103–104&lt;/ref&gt;

Composite in inspiration, the Morning Star as a male god is an original creation by Eminescu. The transition to this ultimate form was eased by lexical precedent: in Romanian, the Morning and Evening Stars are [[Grammatical gender|gendered male]],&lt;ref&gt;Caracostea, pp. 157–158&lt;/ref&gt; and "the biblical notion of Lucifer" was already being confounded in folklore with either celestial body.&lt;ref&gt;Kernbach, p. 325&lt;/ref&gt; In folk sources, the celestial identification is also incomplete: generally used for [[Venus]], the name ''Luceafărul'' may transfer to [[Jupiter]], "whichever is more prominent at dusk."&lt;ref&gt;McBeath &amp; Gheorghe, p. 256&lt;/ref&gt; In describing his new deity, Eminescu apparently assigned him an original attribute, detailed in the 5th stanza: he is the god of seafarers, dragging their ships across the ocean. This metaphor alludes to [[celestial navigation]].&lt;ref name="așlcf"/&gt; Astronomers Alastair McBeath and A. D. Gheorghe focus on another connection, seeing Hyperion as a component of "meteor mythology", alongside [[shapeshifting]] ''[[Balauri]]''.&lt;ref&gt;McBeath &amp; Gheorghe, pp. 255–256&lt;/ref&gt; They also argue that Hyperion's "rapid flight" back to Earth alludes to the [[Eta Aquariids]], and that the celestial void from which he takes flight is a [[black hole]].&lt;ref&gt;McBeath &amp; Gheorghe, p. 257&lt;/ref&gt;

Mystery subsists as to why Eminescu opted to give his Morning Star the unrelated moniker "Hyperion", which references the [[Titan (mythology)|Titans]] of Greek mythology. Philologist Rodica Marian argues that the Morning Star only acquires the name, and learns his true nature, upon meeting the Demiurge.&lt;ref&gt;Marian, pp. 45–46&lt;/ref&gt; Several experts are in agreement that, in choosing "Hyperion", Eminescu alluded to a [[folk etymology]], which gives ''hyper''+''[[aeon]]'' ("above timelessness").&lt;ref&gt;Calotă, pp. 11–12; Caracostea, pp. 82–83; Culianu, p. 72&lt;/ref&gt; As noted by the anthologist Stephen Prickett, the name itself "points to the immortal condition of the male protagonist".&lt;ref&gt;Prickett, p. 231&lt;/ref&gt; Caracostea has a dissenting opinion, arguing that the meaning is literally "superior being", selected by Eminescu from [[Hyperion (Hölderlin novel)|a 1799 novel]] by [[Friedrich Hölderlin]].&lt;ref&gt;Caracostea, pp. 83, 89–90&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, the two mortals have distinctively local, Christian and folksy, names, akin to ''[[Katherine]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Caracostea, pp. 150–152&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philosophy of love===
[[File:Ion Schmidt-Faur - Cătălin și Cătălina.png|thumb|400px|[[Ion Schmidt-Faur]]'s depiction of Cătălin and Cătălina, 1929]]
The personal mythology of ''Luceafărul'' is overall a poetic rendition of a personal [[philosophy of love]]. Caracostea proposes that Eminescu had special reason to dwell on the poem, which must therefore express "a fundamental experience". This is not the case for other ideas he borrowed from Kunisch, which merely resulted in conventional pieces such as "[[Miron and The Disembodied Beauty]]".&lt;ref&gt;Caracostea, pp. 196–197&lt;/ref&gt; The "allegorical meaning" is explained by Eminescu's own comment: "[genius] is immortal, but lacks good fortune."&lt;ref&gt;Alex Drace-Francis, ''The Traditions of Invention: Romanian Ethnic and Social Stereotypes in Historical Context'', pp. 182–183. Leiden &amp; Boston: [[Brill Publishers]], 2013.  {{ISBN|978-90-04-21617-4}}. See also Caracostea, pp. 49, 105; Lovinescu (1943), p. 212; Marian, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; The result, according to scholar Geo Vasile, is Eminescu's "triumph in the world of ideas": "Here, the [[The Rime of the Ancient Mariner|Albatross-poet]] extends his wings in all their magnificent reach."&lt;ref name="gvrecit"&gt;{{ro icon}} Geo Vasile, [http://www.romlit.ro/index.pl/eminescu_recitiri "Eminescu, recitiri"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 3/2013&lt;/ref&gt; 

As noted by Lovinescu, the entire project is "suffused with [[Schopenhauerian]] pessimism";&lt;ref&gt;Lovinescu (1998), p. 43&lt;/ref&gt; according to Gerota, Eminescu's text is Schopenhauerian, but beyond that inspired by [[Alfred de Vigny]]'s "Moses"—although ''Luceafărul'' "rises up to an allegorical form, with greater reach and livelier content."&lt;ref&gt;Gerota, p. 378&lt;/ref&gt; The Schopenhauerian influence is nuanced by Caracostea, who notes that the four stanzas cut out by Maiorescu were this-worldly and optimistic: the Demiurge denies Hyperion sheer mortality, but offers to make him a leader of men; the implication is that such figures are superhuman.&lt;ref&gt;Caracostea, pp. 215–225. See also Bucur, pp. 456–458&lt;/ref&gt; 

Beyond this context, some have identified a larger meditation on the [[human condition]]. Classicist Cicerone Poghirc argued that ''Luceafărul'' is about the unbridgeable separation imposed by ''[[dharma]]'', which Eminescu had read about in the ''[[Katha Upanishad]]''.&lt;ref name="icchc"/&gt; Likewise, comparatist Rosa del Conte sees the work as the "lyrical solving of a metaphysical intuition—about the transcendence which doesn't allow man neither to live, nor to be".&lt;ref&gt;Gogâță, pp. 9–10&lt;/ref&gt; In her reading, ''Luceafărul'' is on a philosophical continuum with other Eminescian poetry; the metaphor of "time as death" first appears in relation to Hyperion's withdrawal, and is fully developed in the posthumous "Memento Mori: The Panorama of Vanities".&lt;ref&gt;Gogâță, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; According to Marian, who criticizes traditional scholarship and relies on insights from [[Constantin Noica]], the core theme is "ontological dissatisfaction". The accent, she argues, falls on a genius' inability to "elevate" a world that only he understands to be flawed.&lt;ref&gt;Marian, pp. 49–53&lt;/ref&gt; Constantinescu suggests an intermediary position, discussing the ''daimon''{{'}}s "taming", his evolution toward a [[Platonic love]] "that surpasses everything erotic in Eminescu's poetry".&lt;ref&gt;Constantinescu, pp. 136–138, 142–144&lt;/ref&gt;

Beyond the "celestial allegory", Perpessicius notes, ''Luceafărul'' is also a love poem, "one of the most natural, most authentic, most universal."&lt;ref&gt;Perpessicius, p. 306&lt;/ref&gt; Ștefănescu reads ''Luceafărul'' as a [[star-crossed]] fable and "eerie love-story", rating it above ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]''.&lt;ref name="așlcf"/&gt; The implications of this have created enduring polemics between exegetes, an early example being one opposing Caracostea to [[George Călinescu]]. The latter, following other [[Psychoanalytic literary criticism|Freudian literati]], commented that Eminescu was essentially obsessed with the idea of love, with ''Luceafărul'' displaying his casual [[Sexual objectification|objectification of women]].&lt;ref&gt;Caracostea, pp. 29–33, 54–60, 72&lt;/ref&gt; The same point is made by Culianu, who notes that Eminescu identified love itself with a [[damsel in distress]] situation and [[voyeurism]], both of which, he argues, exist in the "erotic scenario" called ''Luceafărul''.&lt;ref&gt;Culianu, pp. 68–69, 73–74, 76–82, 103–104, 131–132&lt;/ref&gt; Contrarily, Caracostea insisted that Eminescu's erotic passion was subsumed to a "quest for the absolute", manifested "in all other aspects of [his] poetic being".&lt;ref&gt;Caracostea, pp. 29–33&lt;/ref&gt;

Clues of Eminescu's views on love are contrasted by the element of physical desire, that of a young girl expecting her suitors—"the surge within a human being of a longing that she can only half-comprehend."&lt;ref&gt;N. I. Apostolescu, "Cronica literară și artistică. O. Tafrali, ''Scene din vieața dobrogeană''", in ''Literatură și Artă Română'', Vol. X, 1906, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; This "puberal crisis" and "mysterious invasion of longing" had also appeared in Heliade Rădulescu's piece.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p. 289&lt;/ref&gt; Such precedents suggest that Cătălina is a feeble, ''[[ingénue]]'', victim of her instincts. According to Geo Vasile: "she recognizes her own biological fate and accepts being courted by her mortal neighbor [...]. The maiden who happened to catch Hyperion's affection stands for the narrow fold, the human, historical, ontological conspiracy, downright puny when confronted with the nocturnal body's destiny".&lt;ref name="gvrecit"/&gt; Author Ilie Constantin notes that Cătălin was a natural suitor, who "expunges Hyperion from Cătălina's attention, so that he and she may embark on their own union".&lt;ref name="icchc"/&gt; In contrast to such readings, Vanhese sees the Princess as a playful destroyer, in the vein of ''[[La Belle Dame sans Merci]]'' and ''[[Salome (play)|Salome]]''.&lt;ref name="apnopții"/&gt;

Reviewing the placated tone implicit in the poem, Constantinescu proposes that ''Luceafărul'' "condenses not just one experience, but a whole sum of experiences, of sentimental failures."&lt;ref&gt;Constantinescu, p. 139&lt;/ref&gt; According to a story transmitted by the ''Junimist'' [[Ioan Alexandru Brătescu-Voinești]], who claimed to have heard it from Maiorescu, Eminescu poured into the poem his bitterness toward an unfaithful lover, [[Veronica Micle]]. In this version of events, Micle is Cătălina and the page Cătălin is Eminescu's one-time friend and colleague, [[Ion Luca Caragiale]]; Maiorescu is the Demiurge.&lt;ref&gt;Caracostea, pp. 34–36; Lovinescu (1943), pp. 210–213; Perpessicius, pp. 262, 277, 290&lt;/ref&gt; 

Perpessicius dismisses the account as ''vorbe de clacă'' ("balderdash"), but notes that it was to some extent "natural" that rumors would emerge.&lt;ref&gt;Perpessicius, p. 277&lt;/ref&gt; Brătescu-Voinești was partly backed by another source, Eminescu aficionado [[Alexandru Vlahuță]], who reported his friend's "one-time fling, a curious episode, which inspired him to write the poem ''Luceafărul'' and which I cannot render here."&lt;ref&gt;Caracostea, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; According to Caracostea, this testimony can be discounted, as Vlahuță also hints that Eminescu was delusional.&lt;ref&gt;Caracostea, pp. 27–30, 36&lt;/ref&gt; 

Researcher [[Șerban Cioculescu]] discovered that one aspect of the story was verifiable, namely that Caragiale had had a sexual escapade with Micle before February 1882. Eminescu knew and was angered about it, canceling his offer of marriage.&lt;ref&gt;Lovinescu (1943), pp. 210–211&lt;/ref&gt; However, Caracostea claims, the inspiration for the poem may have been Eminescu's other love interest, Cleopatra Lecca-Poenaru. On one of his notebooks, where he tries out various versions of Hyperion's travels to the cosmic edge, Eminescu interrupts himself with a diatribe, addressed to the "lousy coquette, Cleopatra."&lt;ref&gt;Caracostea, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; Caracostea also argues that the Caragiale–Micle affair, while confirmed, cannot have been mirrored in the poem, as the most relevant passages were written long before 1882.&lt;ref&gt;Caracostea, pp. 35–36&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing in the 1940s, Caracostea pleaded for the poem to be "re-invoked" and kept alive, its themes and hidden meanings explained to successive generations.&lt;ref&gt;Caracostea, pp. 17–22&lt;/ref&gt; A while after, Constantinescu was to note that, "a Romantic in his work and in his life, Eminescu never had a chance to enjoy, after his death, a destiny like the Morning Star, with whom he identified, and if his glow was indeed 'deathless', it never was 'cold'."&lt;ref&gt;Constantinescu, p. 109&lt;/ref&gt; This popular enthusiasm for the poem has been criticized by some scholars, who noted its negative implications. According to [[Eugen Negrici]], the "Eminescu myth" is a resilient element of literary culture, leading from a ''[[poète maudit]]'' trope to the "aggressive tabooing and delirium about genius."&lt;ref&gt;Negrici, pp. 70–73&lt;/ref&gt; As he notes, ''Luceafărul'' was an especially important as [[autofiction]], encouraging "analogical reasoning" among its readers: "the text has produced exhilaration in academia and has stirred affection for the poet, a distortion sparked by the mystique of writings which bear the mark of destiny".&lt;ref&gt;Negrici, p. 71&lt;/ref&gt; Culianu also refers to the "absurdities" and "bewildering speculations" allowed by critical tradition, a "[[Tower of Babel]] erected for worshiping ''Luceafărul''."&lt;ref&gt;Culianu, pp. 67, 72, 81&lt;/ref&gt; 

During Eminescu's withdrawal from public life, the poem slowly garnered its cult following. In 1887 already, the pedagogue Gh. Gh. Arbore was introducing the poem as one of the most significant ever written in Romanian.&lt;ref&gt;Bucur, p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; As noted by Caracostea, two anti-''Junimist'' authors, [[Aron Densușianu]] and [[Alexandru Grama]], resisted this trend, producing conjectural "words of scorn";&lt;ref&gt;Caracostea, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; Caracostea's own embrace of the poem showed its influence on the emergent (and otherwise anti-''Junimist'') [[Symbolist movement in Romania|Symbolist movement]].&lt;ref&gt;Bucur, pp. 458–459&lt;/ref&gt; The first author to draw inspiration from ''Luceafărul'' was Micle. The alleged Cătălina reused the themes in poems she completed after Eminescu's illness and death.&lt;ref name="apnopții"/&gt; She was closely followed by Eminescu's disciple Vlahuță, whose 1894 novel, ''Dan'', "transposes the conflict highlighted in ''Luceafărul''."&lt;ref&gt;Caracostea, p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; In 1902, the [[Romanians in Hungary]] established [[Luceafărul (magazine)|a literary magazine of the same name]], in what was a conscious nod to Eminescu's poem.&lt;ref&gt;Neubauer ''et al.'', p. 51&lt;/ref&gt; Four years later, the poem had entered the [[Education in Romania|Romania's national curriculum]] with a 7th-grade textbook by [[Petre V. Haneș]].&lt;ref name="mamanua"&gt;{{ro icon}} Mircea Anghelescu, [http://www.romlit.ro/index.pl/eminescu_n_manualele_colare "Eminescu în manualele școlare"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 11/2000&lt;/ref&gt; During this interval, ''Luceafărul'' and other Eminescian writings became the inspiration for hugely popular [[postcard]]s illustrated by [[Leonard Salmen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Adina Ștefan, [http://romanialibera.ro/actualitate/proiecte-locale/salmen---o-provocare-pentru-colectionarii-de-carti-postale-85775 "Salmen – o provocare pentru colecționarii de cărți poștale"], in ''[[România Liberă]]'', January 31, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; A [[bibliophile]] edition with 22 artworks by [[Mișu Teișanu]] came out at the eponymous ''Luceafărul'' Society in 1921–1923.&lt;ref&gt;Perpessicius, pp. 371–372&lt;/ref&gt; 

By then, Symbolist [[Dimitrie Paciurea]] had begun work on several works directly referencing Hyperion, including sketches for an Eminescu monument, leading up to his ''Sky Chimera'';&lt;ref&gt;Liana Ivan-Ghilia, "Himerele în Cetate", in ''Materiale de Istorie și Muzeografie'', Vol. XXIX, 2015, p. 272&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nicolae Bretan]] had adapted the poem into [[Luceafărul (opera)|an eponymous opera]], which he himself translated into Hungarian.&lt;ref&gt;Hartmut Gagelmann, ''Nicolae Bretan, His Life, His Music, Volume 1'', pp. 77–86. Hillsdale: [[Pendragon Press]], 2000.  {{ISBN|1-57647-021-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sculptor [[Ion Schmidt-Faur]] also paid homage (to the poem rather than its protagonist) in his 1929 relief of Cătălin and Cătălina, installed at the base of his Eminescu statue in Iași.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [https://web.archive.org/web/20140728044003/http://curierul-iasi.ro/85-de-ani-de-la-dezvelirea-statuii-lui-mihai-eminescu-11515 "85 de ani de la dezvelirea statuii lui Mihai Eminescu"], in ''[[Curierul de Iași]]'', June 13, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; During the interwar, the identification of poet and protagonist was also taken up by Lovinescu in his work as a biographical novelist: he intended to write a romanticized account, also titled ''Luceafărul'', dealing mainly with the hero's childhood in [[Mihai Eminescu, Botoșani|Ipotești]].&lt;ref&gt;Lovinescu (1998), p. 190&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mircea Eliade]] rendered ample homage to ''Luceafărul'', in his novel ''[[Miss Christina]]'', but especially so in his short story ''Șarpele'' ("The Serpent"), which relies on [[intertextual]] allusion to the point of becoming its "[[hierophany]]".&lt;ref name="apnopții"/&gt; Andronic the aviator, a central character in the latter narrative, is a modern-day Morning Star, replicating "the fall".&lt;ref&gt;Vanhese, pp. 180–184&lt;/ref&gt;

The Morning Star reference peaked in usage under the [[Communist Romania|communist regime]]. With the advent of [[Socialist realism in Romania|Socialist Realism]], Eminescu's political works were ignored, but ''Luceafărul'' remained in the textbooks, with commentary by Perpessicius and [[Alexandru Rosetti]].&lt;ref name="mamanua"/&gt; Mythical recovery was particularly strong during the final stages of [[National communism in Romania|national communism]], when, Negrici argues, Eminescu was publicly celebrated with "grotesque displays".&lt;ref&gt;Negrici, p. 75&lt;/ref&gt; Both "Morning Star" and "Demiurge" were informal titles used in the [[personality cult]] of [[President of Romania|President]] [[Nicolae Ceaușescu]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Dennis Deletant]], ''Ceaușescu and the Securitate: Coercion and Dissent in Romania, 1965–1989''.

Although interest in the poem was preserved after the [[Romanian Revolution of 1989|1989 Revolution]], it was largely confined to the private sphere. Ștefănescu noted that, by 2015, Hyperion was perhaps more famous than his creator, like [[Hamlet]] is to [[William Shakespeare]]. He also observed that the once-popular [[metonymy]] "Morning Star of Romanian poetry" (for Eminescu) had faded out of use, as "[[Wooden language|wooden tongue]] [...] relegated to official speeches."&lt;ref name="așlcf"/&gt; As a title, ''Luceafărul'' remained in use by trade unionists involved in the violent [[Mineriad]]s of the 1990s, applied to their leader [[Miron Cozma]].&lt;ref&gt;David A.

New York &amp; Oxford: [[Berghahn Books]], 2004.  {{ISBN|1-57181-111-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his final book, published in 2000, philosopher [[Laurențiu Ulici]] argued that Hyperion had become recognized as one incarnation of the [[national psychology]], in an [[oxymoron]]ic blend: the other component was Caragiale's creation, the easy-going, cynical and prosaic [[Mitică]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Nicolae Balotă]], [http://www.romlit.ro/index.pl/ultima_carte "Ultima carte"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 7/2001; [[Alex.

Hyperion remained important as a cultural symbol within the [[Romanian diaspora]], which had published its first edition. In the late 1940s, Eliade and [[Virgil Ierunca]] founded their own ''Luceafărul'' as an anti-communist journal in [[Paris]].&lt;ref&gt;Neubauer ''et al.'', p. 51&lt;/ref&gt; Another exile, [[Paul Celan]], reportedly introduced his Austrian friend [[Ingeborg Bachmann]] to Eminescu's poem—its core themes were discovered by critics in Bachmann's novel ''Malina'' (1971).&lt;ref name="apnopții"/&gt; ''Luceafărul'' also had a cult readership among the Romanians of the [[Moldavian SSR]], where, in 1974, [[Gheorghe Vrabie]] contributed a set of illustrations in [[aquatint]] and [[eau-forte]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Victoria Rocaciuc, [https://ibn.idsi.md/sites/default/files/imag_file/Grafica%20de%20carte%20in%20creatia%20plasticianului%20Gheorghe%20Vrabie.pdf "Grafica de carte în creația plasticianului Gheorghe Vrabie"], in ''Arta'', 2014, pp. 144–145, 148&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviet republic also hosted a [[Luceafărul Theatre (Chișinău)|Luceafărul Theatre]] and produced a [[feature film]] of the same name, directed by [[Emil Loteanu]].

'''''Miner Wars 2081''''' is a [[six degrees of freedom]] action-survival space-shooter [[Simulation video game|simulation game]] produced by [[Keen Software House]]. The gameplay offers a choice of [[single player]], [[Cooperative gameplay|co-op]], and [[deathmatch]] [[Multiplayer video game|multi-player]]. The game is set in the year 2081, 10 years after the destruction of all planetary objects in the Solar System. The story introduces the player to many types of missions: rescue, exploration, revenge, base defense, theft, transportation, stealth, search and destroy, pure harvesting or racing.

==Gameplay==
The player controls a mining ship on a trek adventure across the [[inner Solar System]]. ''Miner Wars 2081'' is an action-oriented game, set in a [[Destructible environment|fully destructible]] and [[open world|open-world]] environment, which remains persistent as players complete missions or play online with others. Realism and survival is the key aspect of gameplay. Inventory and the way players use resources such as fuel, ammunition, oxygen, ore, and weapons is important when surrounded by dozens of warring factions.&lt;ref name="official"/&gt; The game features both competitive and co-operative multiplayer. Players are able to complete the entire story campaign with multiple online allies.

==Plot==
The game is set in the year 2081, 11 years after the destruction of Earth. Being so early in space technology and colonization, the people of Earth are ill-equipped to survive in space indefinitely. Mining colonies previously established in space allowed some 120,000 people to live in space and continue the species.&lt;ref name="official"/&gt;

==Development==
Development on ''Miner Wars'' began in 2002 as a side project by Marek Rosa, the founder and CEO of Keen Software House.&lt;ref name="Keen Software Website"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120413210241/http://www.keenswh.com/aboutus/ About us] (archived)&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, the project began full-time work and a production team was formed. Originally planned for release in 2011, the production team continued to grow in 2010, and there are currently around 10 core developers both working internally at their headquarters in Prague, and externally in America. The website has undergone several changes, and collects regular feedback from gamers through the forums.

''Miner Wars 2081'' is running on the VRAGE [[Voxel]] [[game engine]] built and tailored specifically for the title.&lt;ref name="official"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.minerwars.com/ |title=Miner Wars Official Website |publisher=Minerwars.com |date= |accessdate=2013-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company is also working on the development of VRAGE 2.0,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.keenswh.com/vrage.html|title=VRAGE|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the newest version of the engine and as it has been announced&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/pressreleases/199831/Space_Engineers_ndash_a_new_sandbox_game_from_Keen_SoftwareHouse.php|title=Gamasutra - The Art &amp; Business of Making Games|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; it will be used for the development of their project called ''[[Space Engineers (video game)|Space Engineers]]''.

===Release===
In October 2010, the [[Pre-alpha#Pre-alpha|pre-alpha]] version of ''Miner Wars 2081'' was released to the public, with a free demo version and discounted pre-order version. ''Miner Wars 2081'' is available for [[Microsoft Windows]], and was later released on [[Xbox Live Arcade]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://games.teamxbox.com/xbox-360/2354/Miner-Wars/ |title=Miner Wars (Xbox 360) |publisher=Games.teamxbox.com |date= |accessdate=2013-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2012, it was approved for distribution by Valve's [[Steam Greenlight]] program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2012/10/16/postal-dad-stanliest-gnome-21-new-games-greenlit |title=Postal Dad: Stanliest Gnome – 21 New Games Greenlit |publisher=Rock, Paper, Shotgun |date= |accessdate=2013-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of January 17, 2013, the Steam version was patched so that no internet connection is required for single player, but still required for multiplayer and to access the editor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.minerwars.com/CurrentBuildFeatures.aspx |title=Changelog |publisher=Miner Wars |date= |accessdate=2013-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Non-Steam versions however, still require an active internet connection during installation and game play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.minerwars.com/Products.aspx |title=Products |publisher=Miner Wars |date=2012-11-28 |accessdate=2013-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Valid keys from other vendors can be registered on minerwars.com where a Steam key can then be generated at no extra cost .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.minerwars.com/Faq.aspx |title=FAQ |publisher=Miner Wars |date=2013-05-30 |accessdate=2015-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Source code===
In March 2013, the game's [[source code]] has been released for easier [[Mod (video gaming)|modding]] purposes only.&lt;ref name="github"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://github.com/KeenSoftwareHouse/Miner-Wars-2081/ |title=Miner Wars 2081 on GitHub |publisher=[[GitHub]] |date= |accessdate=2013-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Content and assets are still proprietary and commercially sold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://github.com/KeenSoftwareHouse/Miner-Wars-2081/blob/master/License.txt|title=KeenSoftwareHouse/Miner-Wars-2081|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==
The game received mixed reviews from critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/miner-wars-2081|title=Miner Wars 2081|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://hodnoceniher.cz/pc/akcni/miner-wars-2081.html Czech&lt;/ref&gt; The most negative review was published by Eurogamer which gave 3/10. Eurogamer criticised Keen Software House that they didn't keep promises to players. Another point of criticism was technical processing and story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-01-07-miner-wars-2081-review|title=Miner Wars 2081 review|first=Phill|last=Cameron|date=8 January 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most positive review was published by ''Gamesite.Sk'', which gave the game 77%. It praised the story, world, engine and co-op mode of the game. On the other hand it criticised that the engine wasn't used fully, there were bugs and that the game is sometimes stereotypical.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gamesite.sk/pc/recenzie/13429-miner-wars-2081-recenzia Slovak&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Musical theatre'''&lt;!-- See the talk page discussions concerning the spelling of "theatre" in this article. --&gt; is a form of [[theatre|theatrical]] performance that combines songs, spoken [[dialogue]], acting and dance. The story and emotional content of a musical&amp;nbsp;– humor, [[pathos]], love, anger&amp;nbsp;– are communicated through the words, music, movement and technical aspects of the entertainment as an integrated whole. Although musical theatre overlaps with other theatrical forms like [[opera]] and dance, it may be distinguished by the equal importance given to the music as compared with the dialogue, movement and other elements. Since the early 20th century, musical theatre stage works have generally been called, simply, '''musicals'''.

Although music has been a part of dramatic presentations since ancient times, modern Western musical theatre emerged during the 19th century, with many structural elements established by the works of [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] in Britain and those of [[Edward Harrigan|Harrigan]] and [[Tony Hart (theater)|Hart]] in America. These were followed by the numerous [[Edwardian musical comedies]] and the musical theatre works of American creators like [[George M. Cohan]] at the turn of the 20th century. The [[Princess Theatre, New York City|Princess Theatre]] musicals (1915–1918) and other smart shows like ''[[Of Thee I Sing]]'' (1931) were artistic steps forward beyond [[revue]]s and other frothy entertainments of the early 20th century and led to such groundbreaking works as ''[[Show Boat]]'' (1927) and ''[[Oklahoma!]]'' (1943).  Some of the most famous musicals through the decades that followed include&lt;!-- Please DO NOT ADD new names to the following list. It is a list that was discussed and agreed-upon by a consensus of editors and is intended to give the name of one major musical from each important genre/era of modern musical (after ''Oklahoma!'') that might be familiar to the casual wikireader. Feel free to make further suggestions on the talk page. --&gt;
''[[West Side Story]]'' (1957), ''[[The Fantasticks]]'' (1960), ''[[Hair (musical)|Hair]]'' (1967), ''[[A Chorus Line]]'' (1975), ''[[Les Misérables (musical)|Les Misérables]]'' (1985), ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (1986 musical)|The Phantom of the Opera]]'' (1986), ''[[Rent (musical)|Rent]]'' (1996), ''[[The Producers (musical)|The Producers]]'' (2001), ''[[Wicked (musical)|Wicked]]'' (2003) and ''[[Hamilton (musical)|Hamilton]]'' (2015).&lt;!-- Please DO NOT ADD new names to the above list.

Make any suggestions for changes or updates on the talk page. --&gt;

Musicals are performed around the world. They may be presented in large venues, such as big-budget [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] or [[West End theatre|West End]] productions in New York City or London. Alternatively, musicals may be staged in smaller venues, such as [[fringe theatre]], [[Off-Broadway]], [[Off-Off-Broadway]], [[Regional theater in the United States|regional theatre]], or [[community theatre]] productions, or [[Touring theatre|on tour]]. Musicals are often presented by [[amateur theatre|amateur and school groups]] in churches, schools and other performance spaces. In addition to the United States and Britain, there are vibrant musical theatre scenes in continental Europe, Asia, Australasia, Canada and Latin America.

[[File:GaietyGirlDudleyHardy.jpg|thumb|''[[A Gaiety Girl]]'' (1893) was one of the first hit musicals]]
Since the 20th century, the "book musical" has been defined as a musical play where songs and dances are fully integrated into a well-made story with serious dramatic goals that is able to evoke genuine emotions other than laughter.{{sfn|Everett|Laird|2002|p=137}}{{sfn|Rubin|Solórzano|2000|p=438}} The three main components of a book musical are its ''music'', ''lyrics'' and ''book''. The book or [[Script (performing arts)|script]] of a musical refers to the story, character development and dramatic structure, including the spoken dialogue and stage directions, but it can also refer to the dialogue and lyrics together, which are sometimes referred to as the ''[[libretto]]'' (Italian for "little book"). The music and lyrics together form the ''[[theatre music|score]]'' of a musical and include songs, [[incidental music]] and musical scenes, which are "theatrical sequence[s] set to music, often combining song with spoken dialogue."&lt;ref name=Continuum&gt;{{cite book |last1=Shepherd |first1=John |last2=Horn |first2=David|year=2012| title=Continuum Encyclopedia of Popular Music of the World Volume 8: Genres: North America |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=__DTvryrBZkC&amp;pg=PA104 |publisher=A&amp;C Black| page=104 |isbn=1441148744}}&lt;/ref&gt; The interpretation of a musical is the responsibility of its creative team, which includes a [[theatre director|director]], a [[musical director]], usually a [[choreographer]] and sometimes an [[orchestrator]]. A musical's production is also creatively characterized by technical aspects, such as [[set design]], [[costume]]s, [[Theatrical property|stage properties (props)]], [[Stage lighting|lighting]] and sound. The creative team, designs and interpretations generally change from the original production to succeeding productions. Some production elements, however, may be retained from the original production; for example, [[Bob Fosse]]'s choreography in ''[[Chicago (musical)|Chicago]]''.

There is no fixed length for a musical. While it can range from a short one-act entertainment to several [[Act (theatre)|acts]] and several hours in length (or even a multi-evening presentation), most musicals range from one and a half to three hours. Musicals are usually presented in two acts, with one short [[intermission]], and the first act is frequently longer than the second. The first act generally introduces nearly all of the characters and most of the music and often ends with the introduction of a dramatic conflict or plot complication while the second act may introduce a few new songs but usually contains reprises of important musical themes and resolves the conflict or complication. A book musical is usually built around four to six main theme tunes that are reprised later in the show, although it sometimes consists of a series of songs not directly musically related. Spoken dialogue is generally interspersed between musical numbers, although "sung dialogue" or [[recitative]] may be used, especially in so-called "[[sung-through]]" musicals such as ''[[Jesus Christ Superstar]]'', ''[[Les Misérables (musical)|Les Misérables]]'', ''[[Evita (musical)|Evita]]'' and ''[[Hamilton (musical)|Hamilton]]''. Several shorter musicals on Broadway and in the West End have been presented in one act in recent decades.

Moments of greatest dramatic intensity in a book musical are often performed in song. Proverbially, "when the emotion becomes too strong for speech, you sing; when it becomes too strong for song, you dance."&lt;ref&gt;Wattenberg, Ben. [https://www.pbs.org/thinktank/transcript1261.html ''The American Musical, Part 2''], PBS.org, May 24, 2007, accessed February 7, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; In a book musical, a song is ideally crafted to suit the character (or characters) and their situation within the story; although there have been times in the history of the musical (e.g. from the 1890s to the 1920s) when this integration between music and story has been tenuous. As ''[[The New York Times]]'' critic [[Ben Brantley]] described the ideal of song in theatre when reviewing the 2008 revival of ''[[Gypsy (musical)|Gypsy]]'': "There is no separation at all between song and character, which is what happens in those uncommon moments when musicals reach upward to achieve their ideal reasons to be."&lt;ref&gt;Brantley, Ben. [http://theater2.nytimes.com/2008/03/28/theater/reviews/28gyps.html?pagewanted=all "Curtain Up! It's Patti's Turn at ''Gypsy''"], ''The New York Times'', March 28, 2008, accessed May 26, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, many fewer words are sung in a five-minute song than are spoken in a five-minute block of dialogue. Therefore, there is less time to develop drama in a musical than in a straight play of equivalent length, since a musical usually devotes more time to music than to dialogue. Within the compressed nature of a musical, the writers must develop the characters and the plot.

The material presented in a musical may be original, or it may be adapted from novels (''[[Wicked (musical)|Wicked]]'' and ''[[Man of La Mancha]]''), plays (''[[Hello, Dolly! (musical)|Hello, Dolly!]]''), classic legends (''[[Camelot (musical)|Camelot]]''), historical events (''Evita'') or films (''[[The Producers (musical)|The Producers]]'' and ''[[Billy Elliot the Musical|Billy Elliot]]''). On the other hand, many successful musical theatre works have been adapted for [[musical film]]s, such as ''[[West Side Story (film)|West Side Story]]'', ''[[My Fair Lady (film)|My Fair Lady]]'', ''[[The Sound of Music (film)|The Sound of Music]]'', ''[[Oliver! (film)|Oliver!]]'' and ''[[Chicago (2002 film)|Chicago]]''.

===Comparisons with opera===
[[File:George Gershwin 1937.jpg|left|thumb|upright|[[George Gershwin]]]]
Musical theatre is closely related to the theatrical form of [[opera]], but the two are usually distinguished by weighing a number of factors. First, musicals generally have a greater focus on spoken dialogue. This is not a hard and fast rule; some musicals are entirely accompanied and sung through, while some operas, such as ''[[Die Zauberflöte]]'', and most [[operetta]]s, have some unaccompanied dialogue.  Second, musicals also usually include more dancing as an essential part of the storytelling, particularly by the principal performers as well as the chorus. Third, musicals often use various genres of [[popular music]] or at least popular singing and musical styles.&lt;ref&gt;[[Anthony Tommasini|Tommasini, Anthony]]. [https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/10/theater/musical-or-opera-the-fine-line-that-divides-them.html "Opera? Musical? Please Respect the Difference"], ''The New York Times'', July 7, 2011, accessed December 13, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, musicals usually avoid certain operatic conventions. In particular, a musical is almost always performed in the language of its audience. Musicals produced on Broadway or in the West End, for instance, are invariably sung in English, even if they were originally written in another language. While an opera singer is primarily a singer and only secondarily an actor (and rarely needs to dance), a musical theatre performer is often an actor first but must also be a singer and dancer. Someone who is equally accomplished at all three is referred to as a "triple threat". Composers of music for musicals often consider the vocal demands of roles with musical theatre performers in mind. Today, large theatres that stage musicals generally use [[microphone]]s and [[sound reinforcement system|amplification]] of the actors' singing voices in a way that would generally be disapproved of in an operatic context.&lt;ref&gt;Gamerman, Ellen.

Some works (e.g. by [[George Gershwin]], [[Leonard Bernstein]] and [[Stephen Sondheim]]) have been made into both "musical theatre" and "operatic" productions.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/porgy-and-bess-that-old-black-magic-421690.html "Porgy and Bess: That old black magic",] ''The Independent'', October 27, 2006, accessed November 1, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lister, David. [https://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/columnists/david-lister/the-royal-opera-opens-a-window-on-sondheim-593414.html "The Royal Opera opens a window on Sondheim",] ''The Independent'', April 5, 2003, accessed November 1, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, some older operettas or light operas (such as ''[[The Pirates of Penzance]]'' by [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]) have been produced in modern adaptations that treat them as musicals. For some works, production styles are almost as important as the work's musical or dramatic content in defining into which art form the piece falls.&lt;ref&gt;[[Terry Teachout|Teachout, Terry]]. [http://www.nea.gov/national/gav/sweenytodd.html "Sweeney Todd"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080418002225/http://www.nea.gov/national/gav/sweenytodd.html |date=2008-04-18 }}, [[National Endowment for the Arts]], accessed November 1, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Sondheim said, "I really think that when something plays Broadway it's a musical, and when it plays in an opera house it's opera. That's it. It's the terrain, the countryside, the expectations of the audience that make it one thing or another."&lt;ref&gt;White, Michael.

In practice, it is often difficult to distinguish among the various kinds of musical theatre, including "musical play", "musical comedy", "operetta" and "light opera".&lt;ref&gt;Kowalke, Kim H.

Like opera, the singing in musical theatre is generally accompanied by an [[Musical ensemble|instrumental ensemble]] called a [[pit orchestra]], located in a lowered area in front of the stage. While opera typically uses a conventional [[symphony orchestra]], musicals are generally orchestrated for ensembles ranging from [[Pit orchestra#Size|27 players down to only a few players]]. [[Rock musical]]s usually employ a small group of mostly [[rock music|rock]] instruments,&lt;ref&gt;These may include [[electric guitar]], [[electric bass]] synthesizer and [[drum kit]].&lt;/ref&gt; and some musicals may call for only a piano or two instruments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mtishows.com/show_results.asp Show index with links to orchestration information] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100213110721/http://www.mtishows.com/show_results.asp |date=2010-02-13 }}, MTIshows.com, accessed October 4, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; The music in musicals uses a range of "styles and influences including [[operetta]], classical techniques, [[folk music]], [[jazz]] [and] local or historical styles [that] are appropriate to the setting."&lt;ref name=Continuum/&gt; Musicals may begin with an [[overture]] played by the orchestra that "weav[es] together excerpts of the score's famous melodies."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Elliot |first=Susan |title=Off the Stage, What's Behind the Music |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/17/theater/17elli.html?_r=0|newspaper=The New York Times |date=August 17, 2008 |accessdate=October 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eastern traditions and other forms===
[[File:Sichuan Opera in Chengdu.jpg|thumb|Chinese opera performers]]
There are various Eastern traditions of theatre that include music, such as [[Chinese opera]], [[Taiwanese opera]], Japanese [[Noh]] and [[Classical Indian musical theatre|Indian musical theatre]], including [[Sanskrit drama]], [[classical Indian dance]] and [[Yakshagana]].&lt;ref name="Gok"&gt;Gokulsing, 2004, p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt;  India has, since the 20th century, produced numerous musical films, referred to as "[[Bollywood]]" musicals, and in Japan a series of musicals based on popular [[Anime]] and [[Manga]] comics has developed in recent decades.  

Shorter or simplified "junior" versions of many musicals are available for schools and youth groups, and very short works created or adapted for performance by children are sometimes called [[minimusical]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.labyrinth.net.au/~foxplays/preview/PDF/Mini%20Musicals%20Preview.pdf "Mini Musicals"], labyrinth.net.au, Cenarth Fox, 2001, accessed 22 January 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=MN&amp;p_theme=mn&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=11E2D982E50C11E0&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM "Theatre Latte Da takes foray into mini-musical form"], ''Star Tribune'', March 30, 2002, accessed 15 January 2010 (registration required)&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Early antecedents of musical theatre===
{{main|Development of musical theatre}}
The antecedents of musical theatre in Europe can be traced back to the [[theatre of ancient Greece]], where music and dance were included in stage comedies and tragedies during the 5th century BCE.&lt;ref name=guide&gt;Thornton, Shay| last = Thornton. [https://web.archive.org/web/20071127051412/http://www.tuts.com/season07/wonderful_study.pdf "A Wonderful Life"], Theatre Under the Stars, Houston, Texas, p. 2 (2007), accessed May 26, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The music from the ancient forms is lost, however, and they had little influence on later development of musical theatre.&lt;ref name=KenrickShort&gt;[[John Kenrick (theatre writer)|Kenrick, John]]. [http://www.musicals101.com/stagecap.htm "A Capsule History"], Musicals101.com, 2003, accessed October 12, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; In the 12th and 13th centuries, religious dramas taught the [[liturgy]]. Groups of actors would use outdoor [[Pageant wagon]]s (stages on wheels) to tell each part of the story. Poetic forms sometimes alternated with the prose dialogues, and liturgical chants gave way to new melodies.&lt;ref&gt;Hoppin 1978, pp. 180–181&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Opera backdrop..gif|thumb|upright=1.15|left|A view of Rhodes by [[John Webb (architect)|John Webb]], to be painted on a backshutter for the first performance of ''The Siege of Rhodes'' (1856)]]
The European [[Renaissance]] saw older forms evolve into two antecedents of musical theatre: [[commedia dell'arte]], where raucous clowns improvised familiar stories, and later, [[opera buffa]]. In England, Elizabethan and Jacobean plays frequently included music,&lt;ref&gt;Lord 2003, p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; and short musical plays began to be included in an evenings' dramatic entertainments.&lt;ref&gt;Lord 2003, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; Court [[masque]]s developed during the [[Tudor period]] that involved music, dancing, singing and acting, often with expensive costumes and a complex [[stage design]].&lt;ref&gt;Buelow 2004, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shakespeare 1998, p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; These developed into sung plays that are recognizable as English operas, the first usually being thought of as ''[[The Siege of Rhodes]]'' (1656).&lt;ref name="Buelow 2004, p. 328"&gt;Buelow 2004, p. 328&lt;/ref&gt; In France, meanwhile, [[Molière]] turned several of his farcical comedies into musical entertainments with songs (music provided by [[Jean-Baptiste Lully]]) and dance in the late 17th century. These influenced a brief period of [[Opera in English|English opera]]&lt;ref name="Carter"&gt;Carter and Butt 2005, p. 280&lt;/ref&gt; by composers such as [[John Blow]]&lt;ref&gt;Parker 2001, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Henry Purcell]].&lt;ref name="Buelow 2004, p. 328"/&gt;

From the 18th century, the most popular forms of musical theatre in Britain were [[ballad opera]]s, like [[John Gay]]'s ''[[The Beggar's Opera]]'', that included lyrics written to the tunes of popular songs of the day (often spoofing opera), and later [[pantomime]], which developed from commedia dell'arte, and [[comic opera]] with mostly romantic plot lines, like [[Michael Balfe]]'s ''[[The Bohemian Girl]]'' (1845). Meanwhile, on the continent, [[singspiel]], [[comédie en vaudeville]], [[opéra comique]], [[zarzuela]] and other forms of light musical entertainment were emerging. ''The Beggar's Opera'' was the first recorded long-running play of any kind, running for 62 successive performances in 1728. It would take almost a century afterwards before any play broke 100 performances, but the record soon reached 150 in the late 1820s.&lt;ref name="dgillan.screaming.net"&gt;Gillan, Don. [http://www.stagebeauty.net/th-frames.html?http&amp;&amp;&amp;www.stagebeauty.net/th-longr.html "Longest Running Plays in London and New York"], Stage Beauty (2007), accessed May 26, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Other musical theatre forms developed in England by the 19th century, such as [[music hall]], [[melodrama]] and [[burletta]], which were popularized partly because most London theatres were licensed only as music halls and not allowed to present plays without music.

Colonial America did not have a significant theatre presence until 1752, when London entrepreneur William Hallam sent a company of actors to the colonies managed by his brother [[Lewis Hallam|Lewis]].&lt;ref name=Wilmethp.182&gt;Wilmeth and Miller, p. 182&lt;/ref&gt; In New York in the summer of 1753, they performed ballad-operas, such as ''The Beggar's Opera'', and ballad-farces.&lt;ref name=Wilmethp.182/&gt; By the 1840s, [[P. T. Barnum]] was operating an entertainment complex in lower Manhattan.&lt;ref&gt;Wilmeth and Miller, p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; Other early musical theatre in America consisted of British forms, such as burletta and pantomime,&lt;ref name=KenrickShort/&gt; but what a piece was called did not necessarily define what it was. The 1852 Broadway [[extravaganza]] ''The Magic Deer'' advertised itself as "A Serio Comico Tragico Operatical Historical Extravaganzical Burletical Tale of Enchantment."&lt;ref name=Kenrick&gt;Kenrick, John. [http://www.musicals101.com/erastage.htm "History of Stage Musicals"], Musicals101.com, 2003, accessed May 26, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Theatre in New York moved from downtown gradually to midtown from around 1850, and did not arrive in the Times Square area until the 1920s and 1930s. Broadway's ''The Elves'' (1857) broke the 50 performance barrier. New York runs continued to lag far behind those in London, but [[Laura Keene]]'s "musical burletta" ''Seven Sisters'' (1860) shattered previous New York records with a run of 253 performances.&lt;ref&gt;Allen 1991, p. 106&lt;/ref&gt;

===1850s to 1880s===

Around 1850, the French composer [[Hervé (composer)|Hervé]] was experimenting with a form of comic musical theatre he called [[opérette]].&lt;ref name=Lubbock&gt;[[Mark Lubbock|Lubbock, Mark]].

In America, mid-18th century musical theatre entertainments included crude [[variety show|variety revue]], which eventually developed into [[vaudeville]], [[minstrel show]]s, which soon crossed the Atlantic to Britain, and Victorian burlesque, first popularized in the US by British troupes.&lt;ref name=KenrickShort/&gt; A hugely successful musical that premiered in New York in 1866, ''[[The Black Crook]]'', was an original musical theatre piece that conformed to many of the modern definitions of a musical, including dance and original music that helped to tell the story. The spectacular production, famous for its skimpy costumes, ran for a record-breaking 474 performances.&lt;ref&gt;Reside, Doug. [http://www.nypl.org/blog/2011/06/02/musical-month-black-crook "Musical of the Month: ''The Black Crook''"], [[New York Public Library for the Performing Arts]], June 2, 2011, accessed June 21, 2018&lt;/ref&gt; The same year, ''The Black Domino/Between You, Me and the Post'' was the first show to call itself a "musical comedy." Comedians [[Edward Harrigan]] and [[Tony Hart (theater)|Tony Hart]] produced and starred in musicals on Broadway between 1878 (''The Mulligan Guard Picnic'') and 1885. These musical comedies featured characters and situations taken from the everyday life of New York's lower classes and represented a significant step forward towards a more [[Legitimate theater|legitimate theatrical]] form. They starred high quality singers ([[Lillian Russell]], [[Vivienne Segal]] and [[Fay Templeton]]) instead of the ladies of questionable repute who had starred in earlier musical forms.

As transportation improved, poverty in London and New York diminished, and street lighting made for safer travel at night, the number of patrons for the growing number of theatres increased enormously. Plays ran longer, leading to better profits and improved production values, and men began to bring their families to the theatre. The first musical theatre piece to exceed 500 consecutive performances was the French operetta ''[[The Chimes of Normandy]]'' in 1878.&lt;ref name="dgillan.screaming.net"/&gt; English [[comic opera]] adopted many of the successful ideas of European operetta, none more successfully than the series of more than a dozen long-running [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] comic operas, including ''[[H.M.S. Pinafore]]'' (1878) and ''[[The Mikado]]'' (1885).&lt;ref name=Lubbock/&gt; These were sensations on both sides of the Atlantic and in Australia and helped to raise the standard for what was considered a successful show.&lt;ref name=WeAll&gt;Kenrick, John.

''[[A Trip to Chinatown]]'' (1891) was Broadway's long-run champion (until ''[[Irene (musical)|Irene]]'' in 1919), running for 657 performances, but New York runs continued to be relatively short, with a few exceptions, compared with London runs, until the 1920s.&lt;ref name="dgillan.screaming.net"/&gt; Gilbert and Sullivan were both pirated and imitated in New York by productions such as [[Reginald De Koven]]'s ''[[Robin Hood (comic opera)|Robin Hood]]'' (1891) and [[John Philip Sousa]]'s ''[[El Capitan (operetta)|El Capitan]]'' (1896). ''A Trip to Coontown'' (1898) was the first musical comedy entirely produced and performed by [[African Americans]] on Broadway (largely inspired by the routines of the [[minstrel show]]s), followed by [[ragtime]]-tinged shows. Hundreds of musical comedies were staged on Broadway in the 1890s and early 20th century, composed of songs written in New York's [[Tin Pan Alley]], including those by [[George M. Cohan]], who worked to create an American style distinct from the Gilbert and Sullivan works. The most successful New York shows were often followed by extensive national tours.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Evan Swartz's ''[[Oz Before the Rainbow]]'' describes the enormous train trips required of the cast of the 1903 smash hit, ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1902 musical)|The Wizard of Oz]]'', which tour ran for nine years, including on the road.

Meanwhile, musicals took over the London stage in the [[Gay Nineties]], led by producer [[George Edwardes]], who perceived that audiences wanted a new alternative to the [[Savoy opera|Savoy]]-style comic operas and their intellectual, political, absurdist satire. He experimented with a modern-dress, family-friendly musical theatre style, with breezy, popular songs, snappy, romantic banter, and stylish spectacle at the [[Gaiety Theatre, London|Gaiety]] and his other theatres. These drew on the traditions of comic opera and used elements of burlesque and of the Harrigan and Hart pieces. He replaced the bawdy women of burlesque with his "respectable" corps of [[Gaiety Girls]] to complete the musical and visual fun. The success of the first of these, ''[[In Town (musical)|In Town]]'' (1892) and ''[[A Gaiety Girl]]'' (1893) set the style for the next three decades. The plots were generally light, romantic "poor maiden loves aristocrat and wins him against all odds" shows, with music by [[Ivan Caryll]], [[Sidney Jones (composer)|Sidney Jones]] and [[Lionel Monckton]]. These shows were immediately widely copied in America, and [[Edwardian musical comedy]] swept away the earlier musical forms of comic opera and operetta. ''[[The Geisha]]'' (1896) was one of the most successful in the 1890s, running for more than two years and achieving great international success.

''[[The Belle of New York (musical)|The Belle of New York]]'' (1898) became the first American musical to run for over a year in London. The British musical comedy ''[[Florodora]]'' (1899) was a popular success on both sides of the Atlantic, as was ''[[A Chinese Honeymoon]]'' (1901), which ran for a record-setting 1,074 performances in London and 376 in New York. After the turn of the 20th century, [[Seymour Hicks]] joined forces with Edwardes and American producer [[Charles Frohman]] to create another decade of popular shows. Other enduring Edwardian musical comedy hits included ''[[The Arcadians (musical)|The Arcadians]]'' (1909) and ''[[The Quaker Girl]]'' (1910).&lt;ref&gt;See, generally, Index to ''The Gaiety'', a British musical theatre publication about Victorian and Edwardian musical theatre.&lt;/ref&gt;

Virtually eliminated from the English-speaking stage by competition from the ubiquitous Edwardian musical comedies, operettas returned to London and Broadway in 1907 with ''[[The Merry Widow]]'', and adaptations of continental operettas became direct competitors with musicals. [[Franz Lehár]] and [[Oscar Straus (composer)|Oscar Straus]] composed new operettas that were popular in English until World War I.&lt;ref&gt;Kenrick, John. [http://www.musicals101.com/who22.htm Basil Hood], ''Who's Who in Musicals: Additional Bios XII'', Musicals101.com, 2004, accessed May 7, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; In America, [[Victor Herbert]] produced a string of enduring operettas including ''[[The Fortune Teller (operetta)|The Fortune Teller]]'' (1898), ''[[Babes in Toyland (operetta)|Babes in Toyland]]'' (1903), ''[[Mlle. Modiste]]'' (1905), ''[[The Red Mill]]'' (1906) and ''[[Naughty Marietta (operetta)|Naughty Marietta]]'' (1910).

In the 1910s, the team of [[P. G. Wodehouse]], [[Guy Bolton]] and [[Jerome Kern]], following in the footsteps of [[Gilbert and Sullivan]], created the "[[Princess Theatre, New York City|Princess Theatre]] shows" and paved the way for Kern's later work by showing that a musical could combine light, popular entertainment with continuity between its story and songs.&lt;ref name=Jones10/&gt; Historian [[Gerald Bordman]] wrote:
{{quote|These shows built and polished the mold from which almost all later major musical comedies evolved. ... The characters and situations were, within the limitations of musical comedy license, believable and the humor came from the situations or the nature of the characters. Kern's exquisitely flowing melodies were employed to further the action or develop characterization. ... [Edwardian] musical comedy was often guilty of inserting songs in a hit-or-miss fashion. The Princess Theatre musicals brought about a change in approach. P. G. Wodehouse, the most observant, literate and witty lyricist of his day, and the team of Bolton, Wodehouse and Kern had an influence felt to this day.&lt;ref name=Quarterly&gt;Bordman, Gerald. "Jerome David Kern: Innovator/Traditionalist", ''[[The Musical Quarterly]]'', 1985, Vol. 71, No. 4, pp. 468–73&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The theatre-going public needed escapist entertainment during the dark times of [[World War I]], and they flocked to the theatre. The 1919 hit musical ''[[Irene (musical)|Irene]]'' ran for 670 performances, a Broadway record that held until 1938.&lt;ref name=Hellz&gt;Kenrick, John.

Its run of 2,238 performances was more than twice as long as any previous musical, setting a record that stood for nearly forty years.&lt;ref name=Salad&gt;[http://www.guidetomusicaltheatre.com/shows_s/salad_days.htm "Salad Days History, Story, Roles and Musical Numbers"] guidetomusicaltheatre.com, accessed March 16, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Revues like ''[[The Bing Boys Are Here]]'' in Britain, and those of [[Florenz Ziegfeld]] and his imitators in America, were also extraordinarily popular.&lt;ref name=Kenrick /&gt;

[[File:Sallysm.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Sheet music from ''[[Sally (musical)|Sally]]'', 1920]] 
The musicals of the [[Roaring Twenties]], borrowing from vaudeville, [[music hall]] and other light entertainments, tended to emphasize big dance routines and popular songs at the expense of plot. Typical of the decade were lighthearted productions like ''[[Sally (musical)|Sally]]'', ''[[Lady, Be Good (musical)|Lady, Be Good]]'', ''[[No, No, Nanette]]'', ''[[Oh, Kay!]]'' and ''[[Funny Face (musical)|Funny Face]]''. Despite forgettable stories, these musicals featured stars such as [[Marilyn Miller]] and [[Fred Astaire]] and produced dozens of enduring popular songs by Kern, [[George Gershwin|George]] and [[Ira Gershwin]], [[Irving Berlin]], [[Cole Porter]] and [[Rodgers and Hart]]. Popular music was dominated by musical theatre standards, such as "[[Fascinating Rhythm]]", "[[Tea for Two (song)|Tea for Two]]" and "[[Someone to Watch Over Me (song)|Someone to Watch Over Me]]". Many shows were [[revue]]s, series of sketches and songs with little or no connection between them. The best-known of these were the annual ''[[Ziegfeld Follies]]'', spectacular song-and-dance revues on Broadway featuring extravagant sets, elaborate costumes and beautiful chorus girls.&lt;ref name=KenrickShort/&gt; These spectacles also raised production values, and mounting a musical generally became more expensive.&lt;ref name=Kenrick/&gt; ''[[Shuffle Along]]'' (1921), an all-[[African American]] show was a hit on Broadway.&lt;ref&gt;Krasner, David. ''A Beautiful Pageant: African American Theatre, Drama and Performance in the Harlem Renaissance, 1910–1927'', Palgrave MacMillan, 2002, pp. 263–67&lt;/ref&gt; A new generation of composers of operettas also emerged in the 1920s, such as [[Rudolf Friml]] and [[Sigmund Romberg]], to create a series of popular Broadway hits.&lt;ref&gt;[[Anne Midgette|Midgette, Anne]].

In London, writer-stars such as [[Ivor Novello]] and [[Noël Coward]] became popular, but the primacy of British musical theatre from the 19th century through 1920 was gradually replaced by American innovation, especially after World War I, as Kern and other [[Tin Pan Alley]] composers began to bring new musical styles such as [[ragtime]] and [[jazz]] to the theatres, and the [[Shubert Brothers]] took control of the Broadway theatres. Musical theatre writer [[Andrew Lamb (writer)|Andrew Lamb]] notes, "The operatic and theatrical styles of nineteenth-century social structures were replaced by a musical style more aptly suited to twentieth-century society and its vernacular idiom. It was from America that the more direct style emerged, and in America that it was able to flourish in a developing society less hidebound by nineteenth-century tradition."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lamb|first=Andrew||authorlink=Andrew Lamb (writer)|date=Spring 1986|title=From Pinafore to Porter: United States-United Kingdom Interactions in Musical Theater, 1879–1929|journal=[[American Music (journal)|American Music]]|volume=4|issue=British-American Musical Interactions|page=47|publisher=University of Illinois Press|location=Chicago|issn=0734-4392|jstor=3052183}}&lt;/ref&gt; In France, ''comédie musicale'' was written between in the early decades of the century for such stars as [[Yvonne Printemps]].&lt;ref&gt;Wagstaff, John and [[Andrew Lamb (writer)|Andrew Lamb]].

===''Show Boat'' and the Great Depression===
Progressing far beyond the comparatively frivolous musicals and sentimental operettas of the decade, Broadway's ''[[Show Boat]]'' (1927), represented an even more complete integration of book and score than the Princess Theatre musicals, with dramatic themes told through the music, dialogue, setting and movement. This was accomplished by combining the lyricism of Kern's music with the skillful libretto of [[Oscar Hammerstein II]]. One historian wrote, "Here we come to a completely new genre – the musical play as distinguished from musical comedy. Now ... everything else was subservient to that play. Now ... came complete integration of song, humor and production numbers into a single and inextricable artistic entity."&lt;ref name=history&gt;Lubbock (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Rodgers and Hart NYWTS.jpg|left|thumb|[[Rodgers and Hart]]]]
As the [[Great Depression]] set in during the post-Broadway national tour of ''Show Boat'', the public turned back to mostly light, escapist song-and-dance entertainment.&lt;ref name=Quarterly/&gt; Audiences on both sides of the Atlantic had little money to spend on entertainment, and only a few stage shows anywhere exceeded a run of 500 performances during the decade. The revue ''[[The Band Wagon (musical)|The Band Wagon]]'' (1931) starred dancing partners Fred Astaire and his sister [[Adele Astaire|Adele]], while Porter's ''[[Anything Goes]]'' (1934) confirmed [[Ethel Merman]]'s position as the First Lady of musical theatre, a title she maintained for many years. Coward and Novello continued to deliver old fashioned, sentimental musicals, such as ''[[The Dancing Years]]'', while Rodgers and Hart returned from Hollywood to create a series of successful Broadway shows, including ''[[On Your Toes]]'' (1936, with [[Ray Bolger]], the first Broadway musical to make dramatic use of classical dance), ''[[Babes in Arms]]'' (1937) and ''[[The Boys from Syracuse]]'' (1938). Porter added ''[[DuBarry Was a Lady]]'' (1939). The longest-running piece of musical theatre of the 1930s was ''[[Hellzapoppin (musical)|Hellzapoppin]]'' (1938), a revue with audience participation, which played for 1,404 performances, setting a new Broadway record.&lt;ref name=Hellz/&gt;

Still, a few creative teams began to build on ''Show Boat''{{'}}s innovations. ''[[Of Thee I Sing]]'' (1931), a political satire by the Gershwins, was the first musical awarded the [[Pulitzer Prize]].&lt;ref name=KenrickShort/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pulitzer.org/awards/1944 1944 Pulitzer awards], Pulitzer.org, accessed July 7, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[As Thousands Cheer]]'' (1933), a revue by [[Irving Berlin]] and [[Moss Hart]] in which each song or sketch was based on a newspaper headline, marked the first Broadway show in which an African-American, [[Ethel Waters]], starred alongside white actors. Waters' numbers included "[[Supper Time]]", a woman's lament for her husband who has been lynched.&lt;ref&gt;Connema, Richard. [http://www.talkinbroadway.com/regional/sanfran/s75.html "San Francisco: ''As Thousands Cheer'' and ''Dear World''"], TalkinBroadway.org (2000), accessed May 26, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The Gershwins' ''[[Porgy and Bess]]'' (1935) featured an all African-American cast and blended operatic, folk and jazz idioms. ''[[The Cradle Will Rock]]'' (1937), directed by [[Orson Welles]], was a highly political pro-[[trade union|union]] piece that, despite the controversy surrounding it, ran for 108 performances.&lt;ref name=Kenrick/&gt; Rodgers and Hart's ''[[I'd Rather Be Right]]'' (1937) was a political satire with [[George M. Cohan]] as President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], and [[Kurt Weill]]'s ''[[Knickerbocker Holiday]]'' depicted New York City's early history while good-naturedly satirizing Roosevelt's good intentions.

The motion picture mounted a challenge to the stage. Silent films had presented only limited competition, but by the end of the 1920s, films like ''[[The Jazz Singer]]'' could be presented with synchronized sound. [[Sound film|"Talkie"]] films at low prices effectively killed off [[vaudeville]] by the early 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Kenrick, John. [http://www.musicals101.com/1927-30film2.htm "History of Musical Film, 1927–30: Part II"], Musicals101.com, 2004, accessed May 17, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the economic woes of the 1930s and the competition from film, the musical survived. In fact, it continued to evolve thematically beyond the gags and showgirls musicals of the ''Gay Nineties'' and ''Roaring Twenties'' and the sentimental romance of operetta, adding technical expertise and the fast-paced staging and naturalistic dialogue style led by director [[George Abbott]].&lt;ref name=KenrickShort/&gt;

===''The Golden Age'' (1940s to 1960s)===
[[File:Rodgers and Hammerstein and Berlin and Tamiris NYWTS.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|[[Rodgers and Hammerstein]] (left and right) and [[Irving Berlin]] (center)]]

====1940s====
The 1940s would begin with more hits from Porter, [[Irving Berlin]], Rodgers and Hart, Weill and Gershwin, some with runs over 500 performances as the economy rebounded, but artistic change was in the air.

[[Rodgers and Hammerstein]]'s ''[[Oklahoma!]]'' (1943) completed the revolution begun by ''[[Show Boat]]'', by tightly integrating all the aspects of musical theatre, with a cohesive plot, songs that furthered the action of the story, and featured dream ballets and other dances that advanced the plot and developed the characters, rather than using dance as an excuse to parade scantily clad women across the stage.{{sfn|Rubin|Solórzano|2000|p=438}} Rodgers and Hammerstein hired ballet choreographer [[Agnes de Mille]], who used everyday motions to help the characters express their ideas. It defied musical conventions by raising its first act curtain not on a bevy of chorus girls, but rather on a woman churning butter, with an off-stage voice singing the opening lines of ''[[Oh, What a Beautiful Mornin']]'' unaccompanied. It drew rave reviews, set off a box-office frenzy and received a [[Pulitzer Prize]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pulitzer.org/prize-winners-by-category/260 Special Awards and Citations – 1944], The Pulitzer Prizes, accessed January 7, 2018&lt;/ref&gt; [[Brooks Atkinson]] wrote in ''The New York Times'' that the show's opening number changed the history of musical theater: "After a verse like that, sung to a buoyant melody, the banalities of the old musical stage became intolerable."&lt;ref name=Heritage&gt;[[John Steele Gordon|Gordon, John Steele]]. [http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/1993/1/1993_1_58.shtml ''Oklahoma'!'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100804175330/http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/1993/1/1993_1_58.shtml |date=2010-08-04 }}. Retrieved June 13, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first "blockbuster" Broadway show, running a total of 2,212 performances, and was made into a hit film. It remains one of the most frequently produced of the team's projects. William A. Everett and [[Paul R. Laird]] wrote that this was a "show, that, like ''Show Boat'', became a milestone, so that later historians writing about important moments in twentieth-century theatre would begin to identify eras according to their relationship to ''Oklahoma!''"{{sfn|Everett|Laird|2002|p=124}}

"After ''Oklahoma!'', Rodgers and Hammerstein were the most important contributors to the musical-play form... The examples they set in creating vital plays, often rich with social thought, provided the necessary encouragement for other gifted writers to create musical plays of their own".&lt;ref name=history/&gt; The two collaborators created an extraordinary collection of some of musical theatre's best loved and most enduring classics, including ''[[Carousel (musical)|Carousel]]'' (1945), ''[[South Pacific (musical)|South Pacific]]'' (1949), ''[[The King and I]]'' (1951) and ''[[The Sound of Music]]'' (1959). Some of these musicals treat more serious subject matter than most earlier shows: the villain in ''Oklahoma!'' is a suspected murderer and psychopath with a fondness for lewd post cards; ''Carousel'' deals with spousal abuse, thievery, suicide and the afterlife; ''South Pacific'' explores miscegenation even more thoroughly than ''Show Boat''; and the hero of ''The King and I'' dies onstage.

The show's creativity stimulated Rodgers and Hammerstein's contemporaries and ushered in the "Golden Age" of American musical theatre.&lt;ref name=Heritage/&gt; Americana was displayed on Broadway during the "Golden Age", as the wartime cycle of shows began to arrive. An example of this is ''[[On the Town (musical)|On the Town]]'' (1944), written by [[Betty Comden]] and [[Adolph Green]], composed by [[Leonard Bernstein]] and choreographed by [[Jerome Robbins]]. The story is set during wartime and concerns three sailors who are on a 24-hour shore leave in New York City, during which each falls in love. The show also gives the impression of a country with an uncertain future, as the sailors and their women also have. [[Irving Berlin]] used sharpshooter [[Annie Oakley]]'s career as a basis for his ''[[Annie Get Your Gun (musical)|Annie Get Your Gun]]'' (1946, 1,147 performances); [[Burton Lane]], [[E. Y. Harburg]] and [[Fred Saidy]] combined political satire with Irish whimsy for their fantasy ''[[Finian's Rainbow]]'' (1947, 725 performances); and Cole Porter found inspiration in [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[The Taming of the Shrew]]'' for ''[[Kiss Me, Kate]]'' (1948, 1,077 performances). The American musicals overwhelmed the old-fashioned British Coward/Novello-style shows, one of the last big successes of which was Novello's ''[[Perchance to Dream (musical)|Perchance to Dream]]'' (1945, 1,021 performances).  The formula for the Golden Age musicals reflected one or more of four widely held perceptions of the "American dream": That stability and worth derives from a love relationship sanctioned and restricted by Protestant ideals of marriage; that a married couple should make a moral home with children away from the city in a suburb or small town; that the woman's function was as homemaker and mother; and that Americans incorporate an independent and pioneering spirit or that their success is self-made.{{sfn|Rubin|Solórzano|2000|pp=439–440}}

[[Damon Runyon]]'s eclectic characters were at the core of [[Frank Loesser]]'s and [[Abe Burrows]]' ''[[Guys and Dolls]]'', (1950, 1,200 performances); and the [[California Gold Rush|Gold Rush]] was the setting for [[Alan Jay Lerner]] and [[Frederick Loewe]]'s ''[[Paint Your Wagon (musical)|Paint Your Wagon]]'' (1951). The relatively brief seven-month run of that show didn't discourage [[Lerner and Loewe]] from collaborating again, this time on ''[[My Fair Lady]]'' (1956), an adaptation of [[George Bernard Shaw]]'s ''[[Pygmalion (play)|Pygmalion]]'' starring [[Rex Harrison]] and [[Julie Andrews]], which at 2,717 performances held the long-run record for many years. Popular Hollywood films were made of all of these musicals. This surpassed the run of two hits by British creators: ''[[The Boy Friend (musical)|The Boy Friend]]'' (1954), which ran for 2,078 performances in London and marked Andrews' American debut, was very briefly the third longest-running musical in West End or Broadway history (after ''Chu Chin Chow'' and ''Oklahoma!''), until ''[[Salad Days (musical)|Salad Days]]'' (1954) surpassed its run and became the new long-run record holder, with 2,283 performances.&lt;ref name=Salad/&gt;

Another record was set by ''[[The Threepenny Opera]]'', which ran for 2,707 performances, becoming the longest-running off-Broadway musical until ''[[The Fantasticks]]''. The production also broke ground by showing that musicals could be profitable off-Broadway in a small-scale, small orchestra format. This was confirmed in 1959 when a revival of [[Jerome Kern]] and [[P. G. Wodehouse]]'s ''[[Leave It to Jane]]'' ran for more than two years. The 1959–1960 [[Off-Broadway]] season included a dozen musicals and revues including ''[[Little Mary Sunshine]]'', ''The Fantasticks'' and ''[[Ernest in Love]]'', a musical adaptation of [[Oscar Wilde]]'s 1895 hit ''[[The Importance of Being Earnest]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Suskin, Steven.

''[[West Side Story]]'' (1957) transported ''Romeo and Juliet'' to modern day New York City and converted the feuding Montague and Capulet families into opposing ethnic gangs, the Jets and the Sharks. The book was adapted by [[Arthur Laurents]], with music by [[Leonard Bernstein]] and lyrics by newcomer [[Stephen Sondheim]]. It was embraced by the critics, but failed to be a popular choice for the "blue-haired matinee ladies", who preferred the small town River City, Iowa of [[Meredith Willson]]'s ''[[The Music Man]]'' to the alleys of [[Manhattan]]'s Upper West Side. Apparently [[Tony Award]] voters were of a similar mind, since they favored the former over the latter. ''West Side Story'' had a respectable run of 732 performances (1,040 in the West End), while ''The Music Man'' ran nearly twice as long, with 1,375 performances. However, the [[West Side Story (film)|film]] of ''West Side Story'' was extremely successful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Conversations with Sondheim | first = Frank | last = Rich | url = http://partners.nytimes.com/library/magazine/home/20000312mag-sondheim.html?scp=1&amp;sq=conversations%20with%20sondheim&amp;st=cse | work = New York Times Magazine | date = March 12, 2000 | accessdate = May 26, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Laurents and Sondheim teamed up again for ''[[Gypsy: A Musical Fable|Gypsy]]'' (1959, 702 performances), with [[Jule Styne]] providing the music for a backstage story about the most driven stage mother of all-time, stripper [[Gypsy Rose Lee]]'s mother Rose. The original production ran for 702 performances, and was given four subsequent revivals, with [[Angela Lansbury]], [[Tyne Daly]], [[Bernadette Peters]] and [[Patti LuPone]] later tackling the role made famous by Ethel Merman.

In 1960, ''The Fantasticks'' was first produced off-Broadway. This intimate allegorical show would quietly run for over 40 years at the Sullivan Street Theatre in [[Greenwich Village]], becoming by far the longest-running musical in history. Its authors produced other innovative works in the 1960s, such as ''[[Celebration (musical)|Celebration]]'' and ''[[I Do! I Do!]]'', the first two-character Broadway musical. The 1960s would see a number of blockbusters, like ''[[Fiddler on the Roof]]'' (1964; 3,242 performances), ''[[Hello, Dolly! (musical)|Hello, Dolly!]]'' (1964; 2,844 performances), ''[[Funny Girl (musical)|Funny Girl]]'' (1964; 1,348 performances) and ''[[Man of La Mancha]]'' (1965; 2,328 performances), and some more risqué pieces like ''[[Cabaret (musical)|Cabaret]]'', before ending with the emergence of the [[rock musical]]. Two men had considerable impact on musical theatre history beginning in this decade: [[Stephen Sondheim]] and [[Jerry Herman]].

The first project for which Sondheim wrote both music and lyrics was ''[[A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum]]'' (1962, 964 performances), with a book based on the works of [[Plautus]] by [[Burt Shevelove]] and [[Larry Gelbart]], starring [[Zero Mostel]]. Sondheim moved the musical beyond its concentration on the romantic plots typical of earlier eras; his work tended to be darker, exploring the grittier sides of life both present and past. Other early Sondheim works include ''[[Anyone Can Whistle]]'' (1964, which ran only nine performances, despite having stars [[Lee Remick]] and [[Angela Lansbury]]), and the successful ''[[Company (musical)|Company]]'' (1970), ''[[Follies]]'' (1971) and ''[[A Little Night Music]]'' (1973). Later, Sondheim found inspiration in unlikely sources: the opening of [[Japan]] to Western trade for ''[[Pacific Overtures]]'' (1976), a legendary murderous barber seeking revenge in the [[Industrial Revolution|Industrial Age]] of London for ''[[Sweeney Todd (musical)|Sweeney Todd]]'' (1979), the paintings of [[Georges Seurat]] for ''[[Sunday in the Park with George]]'' (1984), fairy tales for ''[[Into the Woods]]'' (1987), and a collection of [[President of the United States|presidential]] assassins in ''[[Assassins (musical)|Assassins]]'' (1990).

While some critics have argued that some of Sondheim's musicals lack commercial appeal, others have praised their lyrical sophistication and musical complexity, as well as the interplay of lyrics and music in his shows. Some of Sondheim's notable innovations include a show presented in reverse (''[[Merrily We Roll Along (musical)|Merrily We Roll Along]]'') and the above-mentioned ''Anyone Can Whistle'', in which the first act ends with the cast informing the audience that they are mad.

Jerry Herman played a significant role in American musical theatre, beginning with his first Broadway production, ''[[Milk and Honey (musical)|Milk and Honey]]'' (1961, 563 performances), about the founding of the state of [[Israel]], and continuing with the blockbuster hits ''[[Hello, Dolly! (musical)|Hello, Dolly!]]'' (1964, 2,844 performances), ''[[Mame (musical)|Mame]]'' (1966, 1,508 performances), and ''[[La Cage aux Folles (musical)|La Cage aux Folles]]'' (1983, 1,761 performances). Even his less successful shows like ''[[Dear World]]'' (1969) and ''[[Mack and Mabel]]'' (1974) have had memorable scores (''Mack and Mabel'' was later reworked into a London hit). Writing both words and music, many of Herman's show tunes have become popular standards, including "[[Hello, Dolly! (song)|Hello, Dolly!]]", "We Need a Little Christmas", "I Am What I Am", "Mame", "The Best of Times", "Before the Parade Passes By", "Put On Your Sunday Clothes", "It Only Takes a Moment", "Bosom Buddies" and "I Won't Send Roses", recorded by such artists as [[Louis Armstrong]], [[Eydie Gormé]], [[Barbra Streisand]], [[Petula Clark]] and Bernadette Peters. Herman's songbook has been the subject of two popular musical revues, ''[[Jerry's Girls]]'' (Broadway, 1985) and ''[[Showtune]]'' (off-Broadway, 2003).
{{listen|type=music
|filename=Aquarius - Let the Sunshine In (song from Hair - sample).ogg
|title="Aquarius"
|description="Aquarius", chorus from the original Broadway cast of ''Hair''}}

The musical started to diverge from the relatively narrow confines of the 1950s. [[Rock music]] would be used in several Broadway musicals, beginning with ''[[Hair (musical)|Hair]]'', which featured not only rock music but also nudity and controversial opinions about the [[Vietnam War]], race relations and other social issues.&lt;ref&gt;Wollman, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social themes===
After ''Show Boat'' and ''[[Porgy and Bess]]'', and as the struggle in America and elsewhere for minorities' [[civil rights]] progressed, Hammerstein, [[Harold Arlen]], [[Yip Harburg]] and others were emboldened to write more musicals and operas that aimed to normalize societal toleration of minorities and urged racial harmony. Early Golden Age works that focused on racial tolerance included ''[[Finian's Rainbow]]'' and ''[[South Pacific (musical)|South Pacific]]''. Towards the end of the Golden Age, several shows tackled Jewish subjects and issues, such as ''[[Fiddler on the Roof]]'', ''[[Milk and Honey (musical)|Milk and Honey]]'', ''[[Blitz!]]'' and later ''[[Rags (musical)|Rags]]''. The original concept that became ''[[West Side Story]]'' was set in the [[Lower East Side]] during Easter-Passover celebrations; the rival gangs were to be Jewish and [[Italian-American|Italian]] [[Catholic Church|Catholic]]. The creative team later decided that the Polish (white) vs. [[Puerto Rican people|Puerto Rican]] conflict was fresher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = The Growth of an Idea | first = Arthur | last = Laurents | authorlink = Arthur Laurents | url = http://www.leonardbernstein.com/studio/element.asp?FeatID=8&amp;AssetID=18 | work = New York Herald Tribune | publisher = Primate, LLC | date = August 4, 1957 | accessdate = May 26, 2009 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071212040338/http://www.leonardbernstein.com/studio/element.asp?FeatID=8&amp;AssetID=18 | archivedate = December 12, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tolerance as an important theme in musicals has continued in recent decades. The final expression of ''West Side Story'' left a message of racial tolerance. By the end of the 1960s, musicals became racially integrated, with black and white cast members even covering each other's roles, as they did in ''Hair''.&lt;ref&gt;Horn 1991, p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt; Homosexuality has also been explored in musicals, starting with ''Hair'', and even more overtly in ''[[La Cage aux Folles (musical)|La Cage aux Folles]]'', ''[[Falsettos]]'', ''[[Rent (musical)|Rent]]'', ''[[Hedwig and the Angry Inch (musical)|Hedwig and the Angry Inch]]'' and other shows in recent decades. ''[[Parade (musical)|Parade]]'' is a sensitive exploration of both [[anti-Semitism]] and historical American [[racism]], and ''[[Ragtime (musical)|Ragtime]]'' similarly explores the experience of immigrants and minorities in America.

===1970s to present===

====1970s====
[[File:The Rocky Horror Show Broadway.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Original Broadway poster for ''[[The Rocky Horror Show]]'']]
After the success of ''Hair'', [[rock musical]]s flourished in the 1970s, with ''[[Jesus Christ Superstar]]'', ''[[Godspell]]'', ''[[The Rocky Horror Show]]'', ''Evita'' and ''[[Two Gentlemen of Verona (musical)|Two Gentlemen of Verona]]''. Some of those began with "[[concept album]]s" and then moved to film or stage, such as ''[[Tommy (rock opera)|Tommy]]''. Others had no dialogue or were otherwise reminiscent of opera, with dramatic, emotional themes; these sometimes started as concept albums and were referred to as [[rock opera]]s. Shows like ''[[Raisin (musical)|Raisin]]'', ''[[Dreamgirls (musical)|Dreamgirls]]'', ''[[Purlie]]'' and ''[[The Wiz]]'' brought a significant African-American influence to Broadway. More varied musical genres and styles were incorporated into musicals both on and especially off-Broadway.  At the same time, Stephen Sondheim found success with some of his musicals, as mentioned above.

In 1975, the dance musical ''[[A Chorus Line]]'' emerged from recorded group therapy-style sessions [[Michael Bennett (theater)|Michael Bennett]] conducted with "gypsies"&amp;nbsp;– those who sing and dance in support of the leading players&amp;nbsp;– from the Broadway community. From hundreds of hours of tapes, [[James Kirkwood Jr.]] and [[Nick Dante]] fashioned a book about an audition for a musical, incorporating many real-life stories from the sessions; some who attended the sessions eventually played variations of themselves or each other in the show. With music by [[Marvin Hamlisch]] and lyrics by [[Edward Kleban]], ''A Chorus Line'' first opened at [[Joseph Papp]]'s [[Public Theater]] in lower Manhattan. What initially had been planned as a limited engagement eventually moved to the [[Shubert Theatre (Broadway)|Shubert Theatre]] on Broadway&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, Clive. [http://theater2.nytimes.com/mem/theater/treview.html?_r=1&amp;html_title=&amp;tols_title=A%20CHORUS%20LINE%20(PLAY)&amp;pdate=19750522&amp;byline=By%20CLIVE%20BARNES&amp;id=1077011428934&amp;oref=slogin "Theater Review": ''A Chorus Line''"]. ''The New York Times'', May 22, 1975&lt;/ref&gt; for a run of 6,137 performances, becoming the longest-running production in Broadway history up to that time. The show swept the Tony Awards and won the [[Pulitzer Prize]], and its hit song, ''[[What I Did for Love (A Chorus Line)|What I Did for Love]]'', became a standard.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allmusic.com/search/songs/what+i+did+for+love "Song search: What I Did for Love]", [[AllMusic]], accessed October 11, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

Broadway audiences welcomed musicals that varied from the golden age style and substance. [[John Kander]] and [[Fred Ebb]] explored the rise of [[Nazism]] in Germany in ''[[Cabaret (musical)|Cabaret]]'', and murder and the media in [[Prohibition]]-era ''[[Chicago (musical)|Chicago]]'', which relied on old [[vaudeville]] techniques. ''[[Pippin (musical)|Pippin]]'', by [[Stephen Schwartz (composer)|Stephen Schwartz]], was set in the days of [[Charlemagne]]. [[Federico Fellini]]'s autobiographical film ''[[8½]]'' became [[Maury Yeston]]'s ''[[Nine (musical)|Nine]]''. At the end of the decade, ''Evita'' and ''Sweeney Todd'' were precursors of the darker, big budget musicals of the 1980s that depended on dramatic stories, sweeping scores and spectacular effects. At the same time, old-fashioned values were still embraced in such hits as ''[[Annie (musical)|Annie]]'', ''[[42nd Street (musical)|42nd Street]]'', ''[[My One and Only (musical)|My One and Only]]'', and popular revivals of ''No, No, Nanette'' and ''Irene''.  Although many film versions of musicals were made in the 1970s, few were critical or box office successes, with the notable exceptions of ''[[Fiddler on the Roof (film)|Fiddler on the Roof]]'', ''[[Cabaret (1972 film)|Cabaret]]'' and ''[[Grease (film)|Grease]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Kenrick, John. [http://www.musicals101.com/1970film.htm "The 1970s: Big Names, Mixed Results"], History of Musical Film, musicals101.com, accessed July 11, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

====1980s====
[[File:Elaine Paige Annie Skates.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Elaine Paige]]]]
The 1980s saw the influence of European "mega-musicals", or "pop operas", on Broadway, in the West End and elsewhere. These typically featured a pop-influenced score, had large casts and sets and were identified by their notable effects – a falling [[chandelier]] (in ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (1986 musical)|The Phantom of the Opera]]''), a helicopter landing on stage (in ''[[Miss Saigon]]'') – and big budgets. Many were based on novels or other works of literature. The most important writers of mega-musicals include the French team of [[Claude-Michel Schönberg]] and [[Alain Boublil]], responsible for ''Les Misérables'', which became the longest-running international musical hit in history. The team, in collaboration with [[Richard Maltby Jr.]], continued to produce hits, including ''Miss Saigon'', inspired by the Puccini opera ''[[Madama Butterfly]]''.

The British composer [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]] saw similar success with ''Evita'', based on the life of [[Argentina]]'s [[Eva Perón]]; ''[[Cats (musical)|Cats]]'', derived from the poems of [[T. S. Eliot]] (both of which musicals originally starred [[Elaine Paige]]); ''[[Starlight Express]]'', performed on roller skates; ''The Phantom of the Opera'', derived from the [[Gaston Leroux]] novel, "Le Fantôme de l'Opéra"; and ''[[Sunset Boulevard (musical)|Sunset Boulevard]]'' (from the classic film of the same name).  These works ran (or are still running) for decades in both New York and London and had extraordinary international and touring success.  The mega-musicals' huge budgets redefined expectations for financial success on Broadway and in the West End. In earlier years, it was possible for a show to be considered a hit after a run of several hundred performances, but with multimillion-dollar production costs, a show must run for years simply to turn a profit.

====1990s====
[[File:Audra McDonald (1).jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Audra McDonald]]]]
In the 1990s, a new generation of theatrical composers emerged, including [[Jason Robert Brown]] and [[Michael John LaChiusa]], who began with productions Off-Broadway.  The most conspicuous success of these artists was [[Jonathan Larson]]'s show ''[[Rent (musical)|Rent]]'' (1996), a rock musical  (based on the opera ''[[La bohème]]'') about a struggling community of artists in Manhattan.  While the cost of tickets to Broadway and West End musicals was escalating beyond the budget of many theatregoers, ''Rent'' was marketed to increase the popularity of musicals among a younger audience.  It featured a young cast and a heavily rock-influenced score; the musical became a hit.  Its young fans, many of them students, calling themselves RENTheads], camped out at the [[Nederlander Theatre]] in hopes of winning the lottery for $20 front row tickets, and some saw the show dozens of times.  Other shows on Broadway followed ''Rent'''s lead by offering heavily discounted day-of-performance or standing-room tickets, although often the discounts are offered only to students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Broadway Rush, Lottery and Standing Room Only Policies |url= http://www.playbill.com/celebritybuzz/article/82428-Broadway-Rush-Lottery-and-Standing-Room-Only-Policies| first = Matthew | last = Blank | publisher = PlayBill | date = March 1, 2011|accessdate=March 1, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1990s also saw the influence of large corporations on the production of musicals. The most important has been [[Disney Theatrical Productions]], which began adapting some of [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney's]] animated film musicals for the stage, starting with ''[[Beauty and the Beast (musical)|Beauty and the Beast]]'' (1994), ''[[The Lion King (musical)|The Lion King]]'' (1997) and ''[[Aida (musical)|Aida]]'' (2000), the latter two with music by [[Elton John]]. ''The Lion King'' is the highest-grossing musical in Broadway history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www2.broadwayworld.com/grossescumulative.cfm?sortby=totaltotalGross&amp;orderby=desc| title = Cumulative Broadway Grosses by Show | publisher =BroadwayWorld.com| accessdate = February 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Who's Tommy]]'' (1993), a theatrical adaptation of the rock opera ''[[Tommy (album)|Tommy]]'', achieved a healthy run of 899 performances but was criticized for sanitizing the story and "musical theatre-izing" the rock music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Critic's Notebook; Damping 60's Fire of 'Tommy' for 90's Broadway |url= http://theater.nytimes.com/mem/theater/treview.html?res=9F0CE0DB113CF934A15757C0A965958260| first = John | last = Pareles | publisher = The New York Times | date = April 27, 1993|accessdate=June 28, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the growing number of large-scale musicals in the 1980s and 1990s, a number of lower-budget, smaller-scale musicals managed to find critical and financial success, such as ''[[Falsettoland]]'' and ''[[Little Shop of Horrors (musical)|Little Shop of Horrors]]'', ''[[Bat Boy: The Musical]]'' and ''[[Blood Brothers (musical)|Blood Brothers]]''. The topics of these pieces vary widely, and the music ranges from rock to pop, but they often are produced off-Broadway, or for smaller London theatres, and some of these stagings have been regarded as imaginative and innovative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = A glorious musical romp – with bite! | first = Pete | last = Shaw | url = http://www.broadwaybaby.com/edinburgh/fringe/reviews/batboy | publisher = Broadway Baby | year = 2006 | accessdate = May 26, 2009 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070928043409/http://www.broadwaybaby.com/edinburgh/fringe/reviews/batboy | archivedate = September 28, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2000s–2010s====
=====Trends=====
In the new century, familiarity has been embraced by producers and investors anxious to guarantee that they recoup their considerable investments. Some took (usually modest-budget) chances on new and creative material, such as ''[[Urinetown]]'' (2001), ''[[Avenue Q]]'' (2003), ''[[The Light in the Piazza (musical)|The Light in the Piazza]]'' (2005), ''[[Spring Awakening (musical)|Spring Awakening]]'' (2006), ''[[In the Heights]]'' (2007), ''[[Next to Normal]]'' (2009), ''[[American Idiot (musical)|American Idiot]]'' (2010) and ''[[The Book of Mormon (musical)|The Book of Mormon]]'' (2011). ''[[Hamilton (musical)|Hamilton]]'' (2015), transformed "under-dramatized American history" into an unusual hip-hop inflected hit.&lt;ref&gt;Cote, David. [http://www.timeout.com/newyork/theater/hamilton-1 "Theater Review. 'Hamilton'"] timeout.com, August 6, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, Sondheim argued that of all forms of "contemporary pop music", [[rapping|rap]] was "the closest to traditional musical theatre" and was "one pathway to the future."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sondheim|first1=Stephen|title=Look, I Made a Hat: Collected Lyrics (1981–2011) with Attendant Comments, Amplifications, Dogmas, Harangues, Digressions, Anecdotes and Miscellany|date=2011|publisher=Alfred P. Knopf|location=New York|isbn=978-0307593412|page=xxi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, most major-market 21st-century productions have taken a safe route, with revivals of familiar fare, such as ''[[Fiddler on the Roof]]'', ''[[A Chorus Line]]'', ''[[South Pacific (musical)|South Pacific]]'', ''Gypsy'', ''Hair'', ''West Side Story'' and ''[[Grease (musical)|Grease]]'', or with adaptations of other proven material, such as literature (''[[The Scarlet Pimpernel]]'', ''[[Wicked (musical)|Wicked]]'' and ''[[Fun Home (musical)|Fun Home]]''), hoping that the shows would have a built-in audience as a result. This trend is especially persistent with film adaptations, including (''[[The Producers (musical)|The Producers]]'', ''[[Spamalot]]'', ''[[Hairspray (musical)|Hairspray]]'', ''[[Legally Blonde (musical)|Legally Blonde]]'', ''[[The Color Purple (musical)|The Color Purple]]'', ''[[Xanadu (musical)|Xanadu]]'', ''[[Billy Elliot the Musical|Billy Elliot]]'', ''[[Shrek (musical)|Shrek]]'', ''[[Waitress (musical)|Waitress]]'' and ''[[Groundhog Day (musical)|Groundhog Day]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Berman, Eliza. "On Broadway, It's Déjà Vu All Over – and Not Just for ''Groundhog Day'', ''Time'' magazine, May 15, 2017 issue, pp. 51–52&lt;/ref&gt; Some critics have argued that the reuse of film plots, especially those from Disney (such as ''[[Mary Poppins (musical)|Mary Poppins]]'' and ''[[The Little Mermaid (musical)|The Little Mermaid]]''), equate the Broadway and West End musical to a tourist attraction, rather than a creative outlet.&lt;ref name=Kenrick/&gt;

[[File:Obama greets the cast and crew of Hamilton musical, 2015.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.35|The cast of ''[[Hamilton (musical)|Hamilton]]'' meets President Obama in 2015]]
Today, it is less likely that a sole producer, such as [[David Merrick]] or [[Cameron Mackintosh]], backs a production. Corporate sponsors dominate Broadway, and often alliances are formed to stage musicals, which require an investment of $10 million or more. In 2002, the credits for ''[[Thoroughly Modern Millie]]'' listed ten producers, and among those names were entities composed of several individuals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibdb.com/production.php?id=13138 ''Thoroughly Modern Millie''] at the IBDB database&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, off-Broadway and regional theatres tend to produce smaller and therefore less expensive musicals, and development of new musicals has increasingly taken place outside of New York and London or in smaller venues. For example, ''Spring Awakening'', ''Fun Home'' and ''Hamilton'' were developed Off-Broadway before being launched on Broadway.

Several musicals returned to the spectacle format that was so successful in the 1980s, recalling [[extravaganza]]s that have been presented at times, throughout theatre history, since the ancient Romans staged mock sea battles. Examples include the musical adaptations of ''[[Lord of the Rings (musical)|Lord of the Rings]]'' (2007), ''[[Gone with the Wind (musical)|Gone with the Wind]]'' (2008) and ''[[Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark]]'' (2011).  These musicals involved songwriters with little theatrical experience, and the expensive productions generally lost money. Conversely, ''The Drowsy Chaperone'', ''Avenue Q'', ''[[The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee]]'', ''Xanadu'' and ''Fun Home'', among others, have been presented in smaller-scale productions, mostly uninterrupted by an intermission, with short running times, and enjoyed financial success. In 2013, ''Time'' magazine reported that a trend Off-Broadway has been "immersive" theatre, citing shows such as ''[[Natasha, Pierre &amp; The Great Comet of 1812]]'' (2012) and ''[[Here Lies Love]]'' (2013) in which the staging takes place around and within the audience.&lt;ref&gt;Zoglin, Richard.

In 2013, [[Cyndi Lauper]] was the "first female composer to win the [Tony for] Best Score without a male collaborator" for writing the music and lyrics for ''[[Kinky Boots (musical)|Kinky Boots]]''. In 2015, for the first time, an [[Women in music|all-female writing team]], [[Lisa Kron]] and [[Jeanine Tesori]], won the [[Tony Award for Best Original Score]] (and [[Tony Award for Best Book|Best Book]] for Kron) for ''Fun Home'',&lt;ref&gt;Gioia, Michael.

=====Jukebox musicals=====
Another trend has been to create a minimal plot to fit a collection of songs that have already been hits. Following the earlier success of ''[[Buddy – The Buddy Holly Story]]'', these have included ''[[Movin' Out (musical)|Movin' Out]]'' (2002, based on the tunes of [[Billy Joel]]), ''[[Jersey Boys]]'' (2006, [[The Four Seasons (band)|The Four Seasons]]), ''[[Rock of Ages (musical)|Rock of Ages]]'' (2009, featuring classic rock of the 1980s) and many others. This style is often referred to as the "[[jukebox musical]]".&lt;ref name=Trends&gt;Kaye, Kimberly.

=====Film and TV musicals=====
{{Further|Musical film}}
Live-action film musicals were nearly dead in the 1980s and early 1990s, with exceptions of ''[[Victor/Victoria]]'', ''[[Little Shop of Horrors (film)|Little Shop of Horrors]]'' and [[Evita (1996 film)|the 1996 film of ''Evita'']].&lt;ref name=Kenrick80s90s&gt;Kenrick, John.

This was followed by ''[[Chicago (2002 film)|Chicago]]'' (2002); ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (2004 film)|Phantom of the Opera]]'' (2004); ''[[Dreamgirls (film)|Dreamgirls]]'' (2006); ''[[Hairspray (2007 film)|Hairspray]]'', ''[[Enchanted (film)|Enchanted]]'' and ''[[Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (2007 film)|Sweeney Todd]]'' (all in 2007); ''[[Mamma Mia!

[[Dr. Seuss]]'s ''[[How the Grinch Stole Christmas! (film)|How the Grinch Stole Christmas!]]'' (2000) and ''[[The Cat in the Hat (film)|The Cat in the Hat]]'' (2003), turned children's books into live-action film musicals. After the immense success of Disney and other houses with animated film musicals beginning with ''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]'' in 1989 and running throughout the 1990s (including some more adult-themed films, like ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer &amp; Uncut]]'' (1999)), fewer animated film musicals were released in the first decade of the 21st century.&lt;ref name=Kenrick80s90s/&gt; The genre made a comeback beginning in 2010 with ''[[Tangled]]'' (2010), ''[[Rio (2011 film)|Rio]]'' (2011) and ''[[Frozen (2013 film)|Frozen]]'' (2013).  In Asia, India continues to produce numerous "Bollywood" film musicals, and Japan produces "Anime" and "Manga" film musicals.

Made for [[Television film|TV musical films]] were popular in the 1990s, such as ''[[Gypsy (1993 film)|Gypsy]]'' (1993), ''[[Cinderella (1997 film)|Cinderella]]'' (1997) and ''[[Annie (1999 film)|Annie]]'' (1999). Several made for TV musicals in the first decade of the 21st century were adaptations of the stage version, such as ''[[South Pacific (2001 film)|South Pacific]]'' (2001), ''[[The Music Man (2003 film)|The Music Man]]'' (2003) and ''[[Once Upon a Mattress]]'' (2005), and a televised version of the stage musical ''[[Legally Blonde (musical)|Legally Blonde]]'' in 2007. Additionally, several musicals were filmed on stage and broadcast on Public Television, for example ''[[Contact (musical)|Contact]]'' in 2002 and ''[[Kiss Me, Kate]]'' and ''Oklahoma!'' in 2003. The made-for-TV musical ''[[High School Musical]]'' (2006), and its several sequels, enjoyed particular success and were adapted for stage musicals and other media. In 2013, [[NBC]] began a series of live television broadcasts of musicals with ''[[The Sound of Music Live!]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/tv/2013/12/05/nbc-the-sound-of-music-bianco-review/3879119/ |title='Sound of Music' was a little off |author=Robert Bianco |work= USA TODAY |date= December 6, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the production received mixed reviews, it was a ratings success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/10/arts/television/a-network-is-buoyed-by-sound-of-music-ratings.html |title=NBC Says It Will Put On a Show, Again |author= Bill Carter |date= December 9, 2013 |work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further broadcasts have included ''[[Peter Pan Live!]]'' (NBC 2014), ''[[The Wiz Live!]]'' (NBC 2015),&lt;ref name=variety-ratings&gt;{{cite news|title=''The Wiz Live'' Ratings Strong: NBC Musical Draws 11.5 Million Viewers|url=https://variety.com/2015/tv/news/the-wiz-live-ratings-nbc-musical-1201653402/|accessdate=4 December 2015|work=Variety}}&lt;/ref&gt; a UK broadcast, ''[[The Sound of Music Live (2015)|The Sound of Music Live]]'' ([[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] 2015)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/dec/15/as-itv-prepares-for-the-sound-of-music-live-are-we-watching-tvs-future |title=As ITV prepares for The Sound of Music Live, are we watching TV's future? |author=Jane Martinson | date=15 December 2015|work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Grease: Live]]'' ([[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] 2016).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2016/02/grease-live-makes-the-best-case-yet-for-the-tv-musical/458922/ |title=Grease: Live Makes the Best Case Yet for the TV Musical |author=Sophie Gilbert |date=  February 1, 2016 |work=The Atlantic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/tv-ratings-grease-live-surges-860957|title=TV Ratings: 'Grease Live' Surges on Fox, Nabs 12.2 Million Viewers|author=Michael O'Connell|date=February 1, 2016 |work=The Hollywood Reporter }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some television shows have set episodes as a musical. Examples include episodes of ''[[Ally McBeal]]'', ''[[Xena: Warrior Princess]]'' ("The Bitter Suite" and "Lyre, Lyre, Heart's On Fire"), ''[[Psych]]'' ("[[Psych: The Musical]]"), ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'' ("[[Once More, with Feeling (Buffy episode)|Once More, with Feeling]]"), ''[[That's So Raven]]'', ''[[Daria]]'', ''[[Dexter's Laboratory]]'', ''[[The Powerpuff Girls]]'', ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]'', ''[[Once Upon a Time (TV series)|Once Upon a Time]]'', ''[[Oz (TV series)|Oz]]'', ''[[Scrubs (TV series)|Scrubs]]'' (one episode was written by the creators of ''Avenue Q''), ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'' ([[List of Batman: The Brave and the Bold episodes|"Mayhem of the Music Meister"]]) and ''[[That '70s Show]]'' (the 100th episode, "[[That '70s Musical]]"). Others have included scenes where characters suddenly begin singing and dancing in a musical-theatre style during an episode, such as in several episodes of ''[[The Simpsons]]'', ''[[30 Rock]]'', ''[[Hannah Montana]]'', ''[[South Park]]'', ''[[Bob's Burgers]]'' and ''[[Family Guy]]''. The television series ''[[Cop Rock]]'' extensively used the musical format, as do the series ''[[Flight of the Conchords (TV series)|Flight of the Conchords]]'', ''[[Glee (TV series)|Glee]]'', ''[[Smash (U.S. TV series)|Smash]]'' and ''[[Crazy Ex-Girlfriend (TV series)|Crazy Ex-Girlfriend]]''.

There have also been musicals made for the internet, including ''[[Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog]],'' about a low-rent super-villain played by [[Neil Patrick Harris]]. It was written during the [[2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike|WGA writer's strike]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Exclusive: First Look at Joss Whedon's "Dr. Horrible" | first = Matt | last = Roush | url = http://www.tvguide.com/roush/Exclusive-Look-Joss-9886.aspx | publisher = TVGuide.com | date = June 30, 2008 | accessdate = May 26, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2006, reality TV shows have been used to help market musical revivals by holding a talent competition to cast (usually female) leads. Examples of these are ''[[How Do You Solve a Problem like Maria?]]'', ''[[Grease: You're the One That I Want!]],'' ''[[Any Dream Will Do (TV series)|Any Dream Will Do]],'' ''[[Legally Blonde: The Musical – The Search for Elle Woods]],'' ''[[I'd Do Anything (2008 TV series)|I'd Do Anything]]'' and ''[[Over the Rainbow (2010 TV series)|Over the Rainbow]].''

==International musicals==
[[File:Paris Sette-Takarazuka1930.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.15|Japan's all-female [[Takarazuka Revue]] in a 1930 performance of "Parisette"]]
The U.S. and Britain were the most active sources of book musicals from the 19th century through much of the 20th century (although Europe produced various forms of popular [[light opera]] and operetta, for example Spanish [[Zarzuela]], during that period and even earlier). However, the light musical stage in other countries has become more active in recent decades.

Musicals from other English-speaking countries (notably Australia and Canada) often do well locally and occasionally even reach Broadway or the West End (e.g., ''[[The Boy from Oz]]'' and ''[[The Drowsy Chaperone]]''). [[South Africa]] has an active musical theatre scene, with revues like ''African Footprint'' and ''Umoja'' and book musicals, such as ''[[Kat and the Kings]]'' and ''[[Sarafina!]]'' touring internationally. Locally, musicals like ''Vere'', ''Love and Green Onions'', ''Over the Rainbow: the all-new all-gay... extravaganza'' and ''Bangbroek Mountain'' and ''In Briefs – a queer little Musical'' have been produced successfully.

Successful musicals from continental Europe include shows from (among other countries) Germany (''[[Elixier]]'' and ''[[Ludwig II (musical)|Ludwig II]]''), Austria (''[[Tanz der Vampire]]'', ''[[Elisabeth (musical)|Elisabeth]]'', ''[[Mozart!]]'' and ''[[Rebecca (musical)|Rebecca]]''), Czech Republic (''[[Dracula (Czech musical)|Dracula]]''), France (''[[Notre-Dame de Paris (musical)|Notre-Dame de Paris]]'', ''Les Misérables'', ''[[Roméo et Juliette (musical)|Roméo et Juliette]]'' and ''[[Mozart, l'opéra rock]]'') and Spain (''[[Hoy No Me Puedo Levantar]]'' and ''[[The Musical Sancho Panza]]'').

Japan has recently seen the growth of an indigenous form of musical theatre, both animated and live action, mostly based on [[Anime]] and [[Manga]], such as ''[[Kiki's Delivery Service]]'' and ''[[Tenimyu]]''. The popular ''[[Sailor Moon]]'' metaseries has had twenty-nine [[Sailor Moon musicals]], spanning thirteen years. Beginning in 1914, a series of popular [[revue]]s have been performed by the all-female [[Takarazuka Revue]], which currently fields five performing troupes. Elsewhere in Asia, the Indian [[Bollywood]] musical, mostly in the form of motion pictures, is tremendously successful.&lt;ref&gt;Jha, p. 1970&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hong Kong]]'s first modern musical, produced in both  [[Standard Cantonese|Cantonese]] and [[Standard Mandarin|Mandarin]], is ''[[Snow.Wolf.Lake]]'' (1997).  Beginning with a 2002 tour of ''Les Misérables'', numerous Western musicals have been imported to mainland China and staged in English.&lt;ref name=Zhou&gt;Zhou, Xiaoyan. ''Taking the Stage'', ''Beijing Review'', 2011, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt;  Attempts at localizing Western productions in China began in 2008 when ''[[Fame (musical)|Fame]]'' was produced in Mandarin with a full Chinese cast at the [[Central Academy of Drama]] in Beijing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://townsquareproductions.com/milestones/2005-2009/ ''Milestones: 2005–2009''], Town Square Productions, accessed September 30, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, other western productions have been staged in China in Mandarin with a Chinese cast. The first Chinese production in the style of Western musical theatre was ''The Gold Sand'' in 2005.&lt;ref name=Zhou/&gt; In addition, Li Dun, a well-known Chinese producer, produced ''Butterflies'', based on a classic Chinese love tragedy, in 2007 as well as ''Love U Teresa'' in 2011.&lt;ref name=Zhou/&gt;

Other countries with an especially active musicals scene include the Netherlands, Italy, Poland, Sweden, Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, Russia and Turkey.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}&lt;!-- Note: This article was accused of focusing too much on the U.S. and UK. We need to expand information on other countries' musical theatre experience.

==Amateur and school productions==
Musicals are often presented by [[amateur theatre|amateur]] and school groups in churches, schools and other performance spaces.&lt;ref&gt;Major organizations representing amateur theatre groups include [[National Operatic and Dramatic Association]] in the UK, [[American Association of Community Theatre]] in the US, and the International Amateur Theatre Association. School groups include the Educational Theater Association, which has 5,000 member school groups in the US. See Nadworny, Elissa. [https://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2015/07/30/427138970/the-most-popular-high-school-plays-and-musicals "The Most Popular High School Plays and Musicals"], NPR.org, November 13, 2015, accessed March 14, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Filichia|Filichia, Peter]]. (2004) ''Let's Put on a Musical!: How to Choose the Right Show for Your School, Community or Professional Theater'', Watson-Guptill Publications, {{ISBN|0823088170}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although amateur theatre has existed for centuries, even in the New World,&lt;ref name=Lynch&gt;Lynch, Twink. [http://www.aact.org/community-theatre-history "Community Theatre History"], American Association of Community Theatre, accessed March 14, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; [[François Cellier]] and Cunningham Bridgeman wrote, in 1914, that prior to the late 19th century, amateur actors were treated with contempt by professionals. After the formation of amateur [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] companies licensed to perform the [[Savoy opera]]s, professionals recognized that the amateur societies "support the culture of music and the drama. They are now accepted as useful training schools for the legitimate stage, and from the volunteer ranks have sprung many present-day favourites."&lt;ref name="Cellier and Bridgeman"&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Cellier|first1=François|authorlink1=François Cellier|last2=Cunningham|first2=Bridgeman|year=1914|title=Gilbert and Sullivan and Their Operas|location=London|publisher=Sir Isaac Pitman &amp; Sons|pages=393–394}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Operatic and Dramatic Association]] was founded in the UK in 1899. It reported, in 1914, that nearly 200 amateur dramatic societies were producing Gilbert and Sullivan works in Britain that year.&lt;ref name="Cellier and Bridgeman" /&gt; Similarly, more than 100 community theatres were founded in the US in the early 20th century. This number has grown to an estimated 18,000 in the US.&lt;ref name=Lynch/&gt; The Educational Theater Association in the US has nearly 5,000 member schools.&lt;ref&gt;Nadworny, Elissa.

[[The Broadway League]] announced that in the 2007–08 season, 12.27 million tickets were purchased for Broadway shows for a gross sale amount of almost a billion dollars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | title = The Broadway League Announces 2007–2008 Broadway Theatre Season Results | publisher = Broadway League | date = May 28, 2008 | url = http://www.broadwayleague.com/index.php?url_identifier=press-releases&amp;news=the-broadway-league-announces-2007-2008-broadway-theatre-season&amp;type=news | accessdate = May 26, 2009 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100222053219/http://www.broadwayleague.com/index.php?url_identifier=press-releases | archivedate = February 22, 2010 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The League further reported that during the 2006–07 season, approximately 65% of Broadway tickets were purchased by tourists, and that foreign tourists were 16% of attendees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | title = League Releases Annual "Demographics of the Broadway Audience Report" for 06-07 | publisher = Broadway League | date = November 5, 2007 | url = http://www.broadwayleague.com/index.php?url_identifier=press-releases&amp;news=league-releases-annual-demographics-of-the-broadway-audience-report&amp;type=news | accessdate = May 26, 2009 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100222053219/http://www.broadwayleague.com/index.php?url_identifier=press-releases | archivedate = February 22, 2010 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Society of London Theatre reported that 2007 set a record for attendance in London. Total attendees in the major commercial and grant-aided theatres in Central London were 13.6 million, and total ticket revenues were £469.7 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | title = Record Attendances as Theatreland celebrates 100 Years | publisher = Society of London Theatre | date = January 18, 2008 | format = PDF | url = http://www.solt.co.uk/downloads/pdfs/pressroom/SOLT_180108.pdf | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20081029180320/http://www.solt.co.uk/downloads/pdfs/pressroom/SOLT_180108.pdf | dead-url = yes | archive-date = October 29, 2008 | accessdate = May 26, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the international musicals scene has been particularly active in recent years. Stephen Sondheim commented in the year 2000:
{{blockquote|You have two kinds of shows on Broadway&amp;nbsp;– revivals and the same kind of musicals over and over again, all spectacles. You get your tickets for ''The Lion King'' a year in advance, and essentially a family ... pass on to their children the idea that that's what the theater is&amp;nbsp;– a spectacular musical you see once a year, a stage version of a movie. It has nothing to do with theater at all. It has to do with seeing what is familiar. ... I don't think the theatre will die per se, but it's never going to be what it was.... It's a tourist attraction."&lt;ref&gt;Rich, Frank. [https://www.nytimes.com/library/magazine/home/20000312mag-sondheim.html "Conversations with Sondheim"]. ''New York Times Magazine'', March 12, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;}}

However, noting the success in recent decades of original material, and creative re-imaginings of film, plays and literature, theatre historian [[John Kenrick (theatre writer)|John Kenrick]] countered: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Is the Musical dead? ... Absolutely not! Changing? Always! The musical has been changing ever since [[Jacques Offenbach|Offenbach]] did his first rewrite in the 1850s. And change is the clearest sign that the musical is still a living, growing genre. Will we ever return to the so-called 'golden age', with musicals at the center of popular culture? Probably not. Public taste has undergone fundamental changes, and the commercial arts can only flow where the paying public allows.&lt;ref name=Kenrick /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Predating [[Multiplex (movie theatre)|multiplex movie theatres]], '''neighborhood theatres''' were the colloquial name given to smaller movie theatres located in local neighborhoods, as opposed to the large [[movie palace]]s located in [[downtown]] areas. 

Neighborhood theatres were mostly [[discount theater]]s and typically showed films after their [[First run (film)|first run]] at cheaper prices, often [[double feature]]s. However, because of their size, they would usually show [[reduction print]]s of films shot in such larger-sized formats such as [[Todd-AO]], [[Super Panavision 70]], or [[Ultra Panavision 70|Ultra Panavision]].

'''''Panggilan Darah''''' (Indonesian for ''Call of Blood'') is a 1941 film from the [[Dutch East Indies]] (now [[Cinema of Indonesia#History|Indonesia]]) written and directed by [[Sutan Usman Karim]] and produced by [[Tjho Seng Han]] for [[Oriental Film]]. The [[black and white|black-and-white]] film starred [[Dhalia]] and [[Soerip]] as orphaned sisters trying to make a living in the colonial capital of [[Batavia, Dutch East Indies|Batavia]] (now [[Jakarta]]) before moving to [[Kudus, Kudus|Kudus]] to work at a [[kretek|clove cigarette]] factory.

Shot on location at an orphanage and two factories in [[central Java]], ''Panggilan Darah'' was a modest commercial success in the Indies and [[Singapore]]. Its soundtrack, which featured nine ''[[kroncong]]'' songs, received popular acclaim, and the film's acting received critical praise. Despite this success, Oriental was unable to recoup its expenses, and merged into Multi Film soon afterwards. ''Panggilan Darah'', which was screened as late as 1952, may now be [[lost film|lost]].

==Plot==
Orphaned sisters Dhalia and Soerip (themselves) leave their village in an attempt to make a living in the colonial capital of Batavia (now [[Jakarta]]). After a long period of misery, they are accepted as housemaids at the home of [[Hajji]] Iskak (Mochtar Widjaja). Although initially elated, they find that Iskak's wife (Wolly Sutinah) is a cruel mistress who often beats them. Meanwhile, Iskak's would-be son-in-law is constantly flirting with Dhalia, much to his fiancée's dismay.

The sisters decide to run away from Iskak's home. They make their way to [[Kudus, Kudus|Kudus]] and find work at the Nitisemito [[kretek|clove cigarette]] factory with the help of their friend ([[S. Poniman]]). Not long after their escape, Iskak receives a guest who reveals that the two were his nieces. This revelation spurs Iskak to take out advertisements in newspapers, looking for the young women and asking them to return to Batavia.

Iskak's search has little success until the sisters receive news that he is looking for them, and they quickly return to Batavia. There, the sisters are greeted with open arms. Iskak's wife regrets her earlier treatment of the girls and repents, treating them splendidly and supporting Dhalia's plans to open an orphanage.{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=269}}

==Production==
''Panggilan Darah'' was the [[film director|directorial]] debut of [[Sutan Usman Karim]], commonly known as Suska, a journalist and former member of the touring theatrical group Bolero under [[Andjar Asmara]]. With ''Panggilan Darah'', which he also wrote, Suska became one of several reporters who entered the film industry in the 1940s.{{efn|Others included Andjar Asmara and [[Inoe Perbatasari]] {{harv|Biran|2009|pp=216, 262}}.}}&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Biran|2009|pp=216, 262}}; {{harvnb|''Pertjatoeran Doenia'' 1941a, Warta dari Studio|p=18}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He directed the film for the Batavia-based film company [[Oriental Film|Oriental]], run by the [[Chinese Indonesians|ethnic Chinese]] producer Tjho Seng Han. The production house had previously released three films, all directed by [[Njoo Cheong Seng]], but after Njoo departed for [[Fred Young (director)|Fred Young]]'s Majestic, Oriental had required a new director.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Biran|2009|p=229}}; {{harvnb|Filmindonesia.or.id, Kredit Panggilan Darah}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The film was shot in [[black and white]] by the [[Indo people|Indo]] cameraman J. J. W. Steffens, with editing handled by Soemardjan.{{sfn|Filmindonesia.or.id, Kredit Panggilan Darah}} Scenes were shot at an orphanage for Muslims owned by S. Z. Gunawan (who played herself in the film), as well as at the Nitisemito cigarette factory in Kudus and at a [[batik]] factory in [[Pekalongan]] owned by Tan Jauw Lin.{{sfn|''Pertjatoeran Doenia'' 1941a, Warta dari Studio|p=18}} Writing in 2009, the Indonesian film historian [[Misbach Yusa Biran]] suggested that the film may have been partly sponsored by Nitisemito&amp;mdash;one of the largest cigarette factories in the Indies in the 1940s&amp;mdash;based on the factory's prominence in the plot.{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=270}}

Dhalia, Soerip, and S.&amp;nbsp;Poniman, already known for their singing prowess, starred in ''Panggilan Darah'', which featured nine ''[[kroncong]]'' songs.{{efn|''[[Kroncong]]'' is a type of traditional music with Portuguese influences which was highly popular with the lower-class [[Native Indonesians|indigene]] of the time {{harv|Biran|1982|p=11}}.}}&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Biran|2009|p=270}}; {{harvnb|Filmindonesia.or.id, Panggilan Darah}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Additional roles were taken by Wolly Sutinah and Mochtar Widjaja. The film marked Sutinah's debut for the company; the other cast members had previous screen credits with Oriental.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Filmindonesia.or.id, Filmografi Dhalia}}; {{harvnb|Filmindonesia.or.id, Filmografi Soerip}}; {{harvnb|Filmindonesia.or.id, Filmografi S Poniman}}; {{harvnb|Filmindonesia.or.id, Filmografi Mochtar Widjaja}}; {{harvnb|Filmindonesia.or.id, Filmografi Wolly Sutinah}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Release and reception==
[[File:Miss Soerip, 1941.jpg|thumb|upright|Promotional image of [[Soerip]] released for the film]]
''Panggilan Darah'' debuted at the Orion Theatre in Batavia on 30 June 1941. It was reported as a modest success,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Biran|2009|p=229}}; {{harvnb|''Pertjatoeran Doenia'' 1941b, Warta dari Studio|p=28}}.&lt;/ref&gt; making most of its money from lower class audiences.{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=270}} It was screened in [[Surabaya]], East Java, by August,{{sfn|''Soerabaijasch Handelsblad'' 1941, Film Sampoerna theater}} and by September it had been shown in [[Singapore]], then part of [[British Malaya]].{{sfn|''The Straits Times'' 1941, (untitled)}} A [[novelization|novelisation]] by [[Roestam Sutan Palindih]] was published by the [[Yogyakarta]]-based Kolff-Buning Publishers that year.{{sfn|WorldCat, Panggilan Darah}}

Reviews of ''Panggilan Darah'' were mixed to positive. The journalist Soerono,{{efn|Soerono was, at the time he wrote the article, the editor of the weekly ''Adil'' and the monthly ''Alfatch'' {{harv|Soerono|1941|p=18}}.}} writing in the entertainment magazine ''Pertjatoeran Doenia dan Film'', was pleased with the film's depiction of the [[Islam and children#Orphaned children|Islamic mandate]] to take care of orphans.{{sfn|Soerono|1941|p=18}} An anonymous review in the Surabaya-based daily ''[[Soerabaijasch Handelsblad]]'' found the film "something special"{{efn|Original: "is iets bijzonders".}} and praised Soerip's spontaneity in her role.{{sfn|''Soerabaijasch Handelsblad'' 1941, Film Sampoerna theater}} Biran wrote that lower-class audiences enjoyed the film's music, while the [[intelligentsia]] scoffed at the idea that a factory supervisor would bring a guitar to work.{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=270}} He found the plot illogical, asking why the sisters would not have worked in their own home village and how the destitute sisters could have made the journey from Batavia to Kudus, over {{convert|400|km}} away.{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=270}}

==Legacy==
Unable to recoup its expenses, Oriental later merged into the Dutch-owned Multi Film and ceased producing works of fiction.{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=229}} Suska left the company and joined [[The Teng Chun]]'s Java Industrial Film, for which he directed ''[[Ratna Moetoe Manikam]]''.{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=216}} Most of the cast remained active in cinema for the remainder of their lives. Both Dhalia and Soerip remained in the film industry for the next fifty years; they acted in their last feature films, ''[[Pendekar Jagad Kelana]]'' (''Warrior of Jagad Kelana'') and ''[[Sejak Cinta Diciptakan]]'' (''Since Love was Created'') respectively, in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Filmindonesia.or.id, Filmografi Dhalia}}; {{harvnb|Filmindonesia.or.id, Filmografi Soerip}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Poniman and Sutinah would remain active in the industry until 1975 and 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Filmindonesia.or.id, Filmografi S Poniman}}; {{harvnb|Filmindonesia.or.id, Filmografi Wolly Sutinah}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Only Widjaja is not recorded as performing in any more films.{{sfn|Filmindonesia.or.id, Filmografi Mochtar Widjaja}}

''Panggilan Darah'' was screened as late as August 1952,{{sfn|''Algemeen Indisch Dagblad'' 1952, Cinemas}} but may now be [[lost film|lost]]. Movies in the Indies were recorded on highly flammable [[nitrate film]], and after a fire destroyed much of [[Produksi Film Negara]]'s warehouse in 1952, old films shot on nitrate were deliberately destroyed.{{sfn|Biran|2012|p=291}} The American visual anthropologist [[Karl G. Heider]] writes that all Indonesian films from before 1950 are lost.{{sfn|Heider|1991|p=14}} However, J. B. Kristanto's ''[[Katalog Film Indonesia]]'' (''Indonesian Film Catalogue'') records several as having survived at [[Sinematek Indonesia]]'s archives, and Biran writes that several Japanese propaganda films have survived at the [[Netherlands Government Information Service]].{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=351}}

'''''Paranormal Activity 3''''' is a 2011 American [[Found footage (pseudo-documentary)|found footage]] [[supernatural horror film]], directed by [[Henry Joost]] and [[Ariel Schulman]]. It is the third (chronologically, the first) installment of the ''[[Paranormal Activity (film series)|Paranormal Activity]]'' series and serves as a [[prequel]], mostly set 18 years prior to the events of the first two films. It was released in theaters on October 21, 2011.&lt;ref name="ReleaseDates"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.paranormalmovie.com/intl/releasedates/release-dates.html |title=Global Sites &amp; Release Dates |work=Paramount Pictures |accessdate=2011-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Paranormal Activity 3'' was also Joost and Schulman's first horror film.

The film broke financial records upon release, setting a new record for a midnight opening for a horror film ($8 million) and the best opening day for a horror film in the United States ($26.2 million).

==Plot==
In 2005, Katie delivers a box of old [[VHS|videotapes]] to her pregnant sister Kristi and her husband Daniel, which holds footage of young Katie and Kristi with their mother, Julie, and her boyfriend Dennis. A year later, [[Paranormal Activity 2|Kristi and Daniel's house is ransacked]] and the tapes are missing.

In 1988, a young Katie and Kristi are living with their mother Julie and her boyfriend Dennis. Dennis notices that since Kristi's imaginary friend Toby appeared, strange things have been happening around the house. Dennis and Julie attempt to make a [[Amateur pornography|sex tape]], but are interrupted by an earthquake. The camera shows dust fall from the ceiling and land on an invisible figure in the room. While reviewing the footage, Dennis notices the strange incident. His friend Randy suggests that Dennis place cameras throughout the house. That night, Kristi wakes up and talks to someone off-camera. When Dennis questions her, Kristi tells him it was Toby.

Dennis and Julie hire a babysitter named Lisa to watch the kids, but she becomes desperate to leave due to several terrifying incidents (both captured on camera). The following night, Kristi tells Toby they're not friends anymore. Dennis discovers a strange symbol in the girls' closet and finds the same symbol in a book about [[demonology]]. When Kristi becomes ill, Julie and Dennis take her to the hospital. Katie is left home with Randy, and they play [[Bloody Mary (folklore)|Bloody Mary]] in the bathroom. Randy is attacked and discovers a large scratch on his torso. They try to leave the bathroom, but a black figure moves and furniture is violently flung across the room. After Julie and Dennis return, Randy warns that whatever they're dealing with is dangerous. Dennis tells Julie that the symbol he found belonged to a [[witchcraft|witches]]' [[coven]] that brainwashed girls of child-bearing age into having sons, then forced them to give up their sons; they would not remember anything afterward. Julie dismisses his claim.

The demon harms Katie until Kristi agrees to do what it asks. She asks her mother to take them to her grandmother Lois's house in [[Moorpark, California]]. After Julie encounters frightening activity herself, she agrees to go to Lois's home. At 1 am, they are awoken by loud disturbances and Julie goes to investigate. When she fails to return, Dennis goes to look for her. He finds occult imagery on the walls, including the symbol from the girls' room, and discovers several women, including Lois, dressed in black. He flees back to the house, with the women in pursuit, and finds Julie's limp body levitating above the ground. Her body is thrown at Dennis, knocking him down the stairs. He hides with Kristi in a closet until the demon leaves.

Dennis and Kristi then walk into the kitchen. In the window, Dennis sees the women outside, circling around a bonfire. They find Katie crying near Julie's body. Dennis approaches Katie, but when he touches her, she unleashes a demonic scream that throws him to the other side of the room, injuring his leg. Lois stands before him, and Dennis's body is violently contorted, killing him. Lois then beckons to Kristi and Katie and tells them to get ready. Before they head upstairs, Kristi calls for Toby and growling sounds are heard upstairs.

==Production==
[[Principal photography]] began in June 2011 and ended in August. At the time during production, the film was under the name "Sports Camp".{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} The film was directed by Henry Joost and [[Ariel Schulman]] (who both directed the documentary ''[[Catfish (film)|Catfish]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.reelz.com/movie-news/10249/horror-news-director-james-wan-to-hunt-a-spectre-catfish-helmers-to-tackle-paranormal-activity-3/|title=Horror News: Director James Wan to Hunt a Spectre; Catfish Helmers to Tackle Paranormal Activity 3 |work=reelz |date=May 9, 2011|accessdate=September 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jason Blum, [[Oren Peli]] and Steven Schneider produced, along with [[Akiva Goldsman]] serving as [[executive producer]].

Once again using unique social media strategy after the success of the first two films, ''Paranormal Activity 3'' created the "Tweet Your Scream" campaign on Twitter in preparation for the release.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.splashmedia.com/resources/blog/paranormal-activity-3-uses-social-media-strategy-to-scare-up-tweets/ “Paranormal Activity 3″ Uses Social Media Strategy To Scare Up Tweets].

==Reception==
===Critical===
Review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reports that 68% of 117 critics have given the film a positive review, with a rating average of 6 out of 10. The website's consensus is, "While the jolts and thrills are undeniably subject to the diminishing returns that plague most horror sequels, ''Paranormal Activity 3'' is a surprisingly spine-tingling treat."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/paranormal_activity_3/| title=Paranormal Activity 3 (2011)| work = [[Rotten Tomatoes]] | publisher = [[Flixster]] | accessdate = June 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Metacritic]], which assigns a weighted average score out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, gives the film a score of 59 based on 25 reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.metacritic.com/movie/paranormal-activity-3| title=Paranormal Activity 3 Reviews | publisher = [[CBS Interactive]] | work = [[Metacritic]] | accessdate =October 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[CinemaScore]] polls reported that the average grade moviegoers gave the film was a "C+" on an A+ to F scale.&lt;ref name="HW"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/box-office-report-paranormal-activity-252084|title=Box Office Report: 'Paranormal Activity 3' on Course for Jaw-Dropping $45 Mil to $50 Mil Weekend|last= McClintock|first=Pamela|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]]|date=October 21, 2011|accessdate=October 22, 2011|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/62dfUhoQD|archivedate=October 22, 2011|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, [[Roger Ebert]] gave the film a single star out of four, stating that "the appeal has worn threadbare", but predicting that the film will fare well in the box office nevertheless.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20111019/REVIEWS/111029999 | work=Chicago Sun-Times | title=Paranormal Activity 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Box office===
The film performed even better than its predecessors, grossing $8 million from midnight showings, setting yet another record for a horror film. Its total Friday gross was an estimated $26.2 million, which was the best opening day gross for a 2011 film since ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2]]'' in July.&lt;ref&gt;[http://insidemovies.ew.com/2011/10/22/box-office-paranormal-activity-3/ Box office update: 'Paranormal Activity 3' records best opening day ($26.2 mil) since 'Harry Potter']&lt;/ref&gt; Bringing its total to $52.6 million, it set a new record for the franchise, a horror film (''Paranormal Activity 2'', $40.6 million). At the time of its release, it set a new opening weekend record for a film released in the month of October as well as the fall season (later surpassed by ''[[Gravity (film)|Gravity]]'' in 2013 with a weekend gross of $55.8 million).

''Paranormal Activity 3'' grossed $104,028,807 in the United States and Canada, along with $101,675,011 in other countries, for a worldwide total of $205,703,818,&lt;ref name="boxoffice"/&gt; making it the highest-grossing film in the 'Paranormal Activity' series.

===Home media===

'''Reginald Scot''' (or '''Scott''') ({{circa|lk=no|1538}}&amp;nbsp;– 9 October 1599) was an Englishman and [[Member of Parliament]],   the author of ''[[The Discoverie of Witchcraft]]'', which was published in 1584. It was written against the belief in witches, to show that [[witchcraft]] did not exist. Part of its content exposes how (apparently miraculous) feats of magic were done, and the book is often deemed the first textbook on [[Magic (illusion)|conjuring]].

==Life==
He was son of Richard Scot, second son of [[John Scott (died 1533)|Sir John Scott]] (died 1533) of [[Scots Hall]] in [[Smeeth]], near [[Ashford, Kent|Ashford]] in [[Kent]]. His mother was Mary, daughter of George Whetenall, sheriff of Kent in 1527. His father died before 1544, and his mother remarried Fulk Onslow, clerk of the parliament; dying on 8 October 1582, she was buried in the church of [[Hatfield, Hertfordshire]]. Reginald or Reynold (as he signed his name in accordance with contemporary practice) was born about 1538.

When about seventeen, Scot entered [[Hart Hall, Oxford]], but left the university without a degree. His writings show some knowledge of law, but he is not known to have joined any [[inn of court]]. Marrying in 1568, he seems to have spent the rest of his life in his native county. His time was mainly passed as an active country gentleman, managing property which he inherited from his kinsfolk about Smeeth and [[Brabourne]], or directing the business affairs of his first cousin, Sir Thomas Scot, who proved a generous patron, and in whose house of Scots Hall he often stayed. He was collector of subsidies for the [[lathe (county subdivision)]] of Shepway in 1586 and 1587, and he was perhaps the Reginald Scot who acted in 1588 as a captain of untrained foot-soldiers at the county muster. He was returned to the parliament of 1588–9 as member for [[New Romney (UK Parliament constituency)|New Romney]], and he was probably a [[justice of the peace]]. He describes himself as "esquire" in the title-page of his ''Discoverie'', and is elsewhere designated "armiger".

Scot married at Brabourne, on 11 October 1568, Jane Cobbe of Cobbes Place, in the parish of [[Aldington, Kent|Aldington]]. By her he had a daughter Elizabeth, who married Sackville Turnor of Tablehurt, [[Sussex]]. Subsequently Scot married a second wife, a widow named Alice Collyar, who had a daughter called Mary by her former husband.

Scot made his own will (drawing it with his own hand) on 15 September 1599. He died at Smeeth on 9 October following, and was probably buried in the church there. His small properties about Brabourne, Aldington, and [[Romney Marsh]] he left to his widow. The last words of his will run: "Great is the trouble my poor wife hath had with me, and small is the comfort she hath received at my hands, whom if I had not matched withal I had not died worth one [[Groat (coin)|groat]]."

==Doctrine and Espoused Belief==
In the ''Discoverie'',  Scot aligns himself with [[Reformed Protestantism]], quoting [[John Calvin]] more than a dozen times. Calvin in turn was echoing the skepticism toward superstitions of early English reformer [[John Wycliffe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=John|last= Wycliffe |title=An Apology for Lollard Doctrines. (London, Camden Society, 1842) |page=92 |url=https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=2PwUAAAAQAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scot expresses what is often called the [[Providentialism|Providential view]] in stating that "it is neither a witch, nor devil, but glorious God that maketh the thunder...God maketh the blustering tempests and whirlwinds..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Reginald |last=Scot|title=Discoverie of Witchcraft|year=1584 |page= 2|url=https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=2fNZAAAAcAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; This doctrine was also aligned with the tenth-century [[Canon Episcopi]] and Scot quotes from it.&lt;ref&gt;Scot,''Discoverie'', p. 65-66, 97.&lt;/ref&gt; In the last half of the sixteenth century, an active theological debate continued from various pulpits throughout Europe – Calvinist, Lutheran, and Roman Catholic – between those who supported the skeptical Episcopi/Providential tradition and those who believed that witches could obtain real supernatural powers through an agreement or pact with the devil.&lt;ref&gt;HC Erik Midelfort, ''Witch Hunting in Southwest Germany'' (Stanford, 1972) p. 56-66. Also by Midelfort, see 1971 essay, ''Witchcraft and Religion in Sixteenth-Century Germany, The Formation and Consequences of Orthodoxy.''&lt;/ref&gt;  The latter belief in the power of witches, and an intense phobia toward them, was associated by Scot with the book ''[[Malleus Maleficarum]]'', and upon this book Scot focuses the most criticism, and lumps others aligned with the same view of witchcraft: "...from whom [[Jean Bodin|[Jean] Bodin]] and all the other writers... do receive their light..."&lt;ref&gt;Scot,''Discoverie'', p. 9,11, 19, 77, 78. ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

A late twentieth-century historian argues that Scot was likely influenced by, and perhaps a member of, the [[Familia Caritatis|Family of Love]].&lt;ref&gt;David Wootton, Reginald Scot/ Abraham Fleming/ The Family of Love, ''Languages of Witchcraft'', ed. Stuart Clark. (New York, 2001) p. 119-138.&lt;/ref&gt; An intriguing clue to this theory is the name [[Abraham Fleming]] written backwards (Gnimelf Maharba) in Scot's lengthy bibliography in the front pages of the ''Discoverie.''

==Works==

===About hops cultivation===
In 1574 he published his ''Perfect Platform of a Hop-garden, and necessary instructions for the making and maintenance thereof, with Notes and Rules for Reformation of all Abuses.'' The work, which is dedicated to Serjeant William Lovelace of Bethersden, is the first practical treatise on [[Hops|hop]] culture in England; the processes are illustrated by woodcuts. Scot, according to a statement of the printer, was out of London while the work was going through the press. A second edition appeared in 1576, and a third in 1578.

===About witchcraft===
{{main|The Discoverie of Witchcraft}}
His work on witchcraft was ''[[The Discoverie of Witchcraft]]'', ''wherein the Lewde dealing of Witches and Witchmongers is notablie detected, in sixteen books … whereunto is added a Treatise upon the Nature and Substance of Spirits and Devils'', 1584. Scot enumerates 212 authors whose works in Latin he had consulted, and twenty-three authors who wrote in English. He studied the superstitions respecting witchcraft in courts of law in country districts, where the prosecution of witches was constant, and in village life, where the belief in witchcraft flourished. He set himself to prove that the belief in witchcraft and magic was rejected alike by reason and religion, and that spiritualistic manifestations were either wilful impostures or illusions due to mental disturbance in the observers.

==Remodernist film movement==

In January 2010 Rashidi joined the Remodernist film movement. Remodernist film developed in the United States and the United Kingdom in the early 21st century with ideas related to those of the international art movement [[Stuckism]] and its manifesto, Remodernism. Key figures are Harris Smith and Jesse Richards. On August 27, 2008, Jesse Richards published a 15-point Remodernist Film Manifesto, calling for a "new spirituality in cinema", use of intuition in filmmaking, as well as describing the remodernist film as being a "stripped down, minimal, lyrical, punk kind of filmmaking". In late August, 2009, an International Alliance of Remodernist Filmmakers was started by Jesse Richards in order to promote discussion and collaboration amongst those following the manifesto.

The Australian film magazine [[Filmink]] announced Rashidi's participation in a compilation feature film by the Remodernist film movement in February 2010.&lt;ref name="Filmink"/&gt;

Rouzbeh Rashidi left the Remodernist film movement in late 2011.

Rouzbeh Rashidi’s resume with Remodernist film:

*Two of Rouzbeh Rashidi's short films Grey (2008) and Now &amp; Forever (2008) was picked by [[Jesse Richards]] for the short films of Remodernist film.
*An article about Remodernist film &amp; [[Jesse Richards]] was published on 17 August 2010 in [[Shargh]] Newspaper (Iran) by Kamyar Kordestani &amp; with the help of Rouzbeh Rashidi.
*Remodernist film manifesto was translated into Persian language by Kamyar Kordestani, Reza Radbeh &amp; with the help of Rouzbeh Rashidi. It was subsequently published on 31 August 2010 in the Shargh Newspaper (Iran).
*Completion of the feature film [[Closure of Catharsis]] (2011) which was based and inspired by [[Remodernist film]] manifesto.
*Contribution to the Remodernist omnibus feature film “In Passing (2011)“.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15251">The '''Shapley value''' is a solution concept in cooperative [[game theory]]. It was named in honor of [[Lloyd Shapley]], who introduced it in 1953.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Contributions to the Theory of Games|last=Shapley|first=Lloyd S.|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1953|isbn=9781400881970|editor-last=Kuhn|editor-first=H.

The Shapley value is characterized by a collection of desirable properties. Hart (1989) provides a survey of the subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The New Palgrave: Game Theory|last=Hart|first=Sergiu|publisher=Norton|year=1989|isbn=|editor-last=Eatwell|editor-first=J.|location=|pages=210–216|chapter=Shapley Value|doi=10.1007/978-1-349-20181-5_25|editor2-first=M.|editor2-last=Milgate|editor3-first=P.|editor3-last=Newman}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=A Bibliography of Cooperative Games: Value Theory |first=Sergiu |last=Hart |date=May 12, 2016 |url=http://www.ma.huji.ac.il/~hart/value.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The setup is as follows: a coalition of players cooperates, and obtains a certain overall gain from that cooperation. Since some players may contribute more to the coalition than others or may possess different  bargaining power (for example threatening to destroy the whole surplus), what final distribution of generated surplus among the players should arise in any particular game? Or phrased differently: how important is each player to the overall cooperation, and what payoff can he or she reasonably expect? The Shapley value provides one possible answer to this question.

For cost-sharing games with concave cost functions, the optimal cost-sharing rule that optimizes the [[price of anarchy]], followed by the [[price of stability]], is precisely the Shapley value cost-sharing rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Phillips|first=Matthew|last2=Marden|first2=Jason R.|date=July 2018|title=Design Tradeoffs in Concave Cost-Sharing Games|url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8078240/|journal=IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control|language=en-US|volume=63|issue=7|pages=2242–2247|doi=10.1109/tac.2017.2765299|issn=0018-9286}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Formal definition ==

Formally, a '''coalitional game''' is defined as:
There is a set ''N'' (of ''n'' players) and a [[function (mathematics)|function]] &lt;math&gt; v &lt;/math&gt; that maps subsets of players to the real numbers:  &lt;math&gt; v \; : \; 2^N \to \mathbb{R} &lt;/math&gt;, with &lt;math&gt; v(\emptyset)=0&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\emptyset&lt;/math&gt; denotes the empty set. The function &lt;math&gt; v &lt;/math&gt; is called a characteristic function.

The function &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; has the following meaning: if ''S'' is a coalition of players, then ''&lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;''(''S''), called the worth of coalition ''S'', describes the total expected sum of payoffs the members of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; can obtain by cooperation.

The Shapley value is one way to distribute the total gains to the players, assuming that they all collaborate. It is a "fair" distribution in the sense that it is the only distribution with certain desirable properties listed below. According to the Shapley value,&lt;ref&gt;For a proof of unique existence, see {{cite book |first=Tatsuro |last=Ichiishi |title=Game Theory for Economic Analysis |location=New York |publisher=Academic Press |year=1983 |isbn=0-12-370180-5 |pages=118–120 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zFm7AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA118 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the amount that player ''i'' gets given in a coalitional game &lt;math&gt;( v, N) &lt;/math&gt; is

:&lt;math&gt;\phi_i(v)=\sum_{S \subseteq N \setminus
\{i\}} \frac{|S|!\; (|N|-|S|-1)!}{|N|!}(v(S\cup\{i\})-v(S))&lt;/math&gt;

where ''n'' is the total number of players and the sum extends over all subsets ''S'' of ''N'' not containing player ''i''. The formula can be interpreted as follows: imagine the coalition being formed one actor at a time, with each actor demanding their contribution ''v''(''S''∪{''i''}) − ''v''(''S'') as a fair compensation, and then for each actor take the average of this contribution over the possible different [[permutation]]s in which the coalition can be formed.

An alternative equivalent formula for the Shapley value is:

:&lt;math&gt;\phi_i(v)= \frac{1}{|N|!}\sum_R\left [ v(P_i^R \cup \left \{ i \right \}) - v(P_i^R) \right ]&lt;/math&gt;

where the sum ranges over all &lt;math&gt;|N|!&lt;/math&gt; orders &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; of the players and &lt;math&gt;P_i^R&lt;/math&gt; is the set of players in &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; which precede &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; in the order &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;. Finally, it can also be expressed as

&lt;math&gt;\phi_i(v) = \frac{1}{|N|} \sum_{S \subseteq N \setminus \{i\}} \binom{|N|-1}{|S|}^{-1} (v(S \cup \{i\}) - v(S))&lt;/math&gt;

which can be interpreted as

&lt;math&gt;\phi_i(v) = \frac{1}{\text{number of players}} \sum_{\text{coalitions excluding }i} \frac{\text{marginal contribution of }i\text{ to coalition}}{\text{number of coalitions excluding }i\text{ of this size}}&lt;/math&gt;

== Examples ==
=== Business example ===
Consider a simplified description of a business. An owner, ''o'', provides crucial capital in the sense that without him no gains can be obtained. There are ''k'' workers ''w''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''w''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;, each of whom contributes an amount ''p'' to the total profit. ''m'' is the number of workers in the business. 

:&lt;math&gt;N = \{o, w_1,...,w_k\}&lt;/math&gt;

The value function for this coalitional game is
:&lt;math&gt;
v(S) = 
\begin{cases}
  mp,  &amp; \text{if }o \in S\\
  0, &amp; \text{otherwise}\\
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

Computing the Shapley value for this coalition game leads to a value of {{sfrac|kp|2}} for the owner and {{sfrac|p|2}} for each worker.

=== Glove game ===
The glove game is a coalitional game where the players have left- and right-hand gloves and the goal is to form pairs. Let
:&lt;math&gt;N = \{1, 2, 3\},&lt;/math&gt;
where players 1 and 2 have right-hand gloves and player 3 has a left-hand glove.

The value function for this coalitional game is
:&lt;math&gt;
v(S) = 
\begin{cases}
  1  &amp; \text{if }S \in \left\{ \{1,3\},\{2,3\},\{1,2,3\} \right\};\\
  0 &amp; \text{otherwise}.\\
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

The formula for calculating the Shapley value is

:&lt;math&gt;\phi_i(v)= \frac{1}{|N|!}\sum_R\left [ v(P_i^R \cup \left \{ i \right \}) - v(P_i^R) \right ],&lt;/math&gt;

where {{mvar|R}} is an ordering of the players and &lt;math&gt;P_i^R&lt;/math&gt; is the set of players in {{mvar|N}} which precede {{mvar|i}} in the order {{mvar|R}}.

The following table displays the marginal contributions of Player 1.

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{array}{|c|l|}
\text{Order }R\,\! &amp; MC_1
\\
\hline
{1,2,3}
&amp;v(\{1\}) - v(\varnothing) = 0 - 0 = 0
\\
{1,3,2}
&amp;v(\{1\}) - v(\varnothing) = 0 - 0 = 0
\\
{2,1,3}
&amp;v(\{1,2\}) - v(\{2\}) = 0 - 0 = 0
\\
{2,3,1}
&amp;v(\{1,2,3\}) - v(\{2,3\}) = 1 - 1 = 0
\\
{3,1,2}
&amp;v(\{1,3\}) - v(\{3\}) = 1 - 0 =1
\\
{3,2,1}
&amp;v(\{1,2,3\}) - v(\{2,3\}) = 1 - 1 = 0
\\
\end{array}
&lt;/math&gt;

Observe
:&lt;math&gt;\phi_1(v)= \!\left(\frac{1}{6}\right)(1)=\frac{1}{6}.&lt;/math&gt;

By a symmetry argument it can be shown that
:&lt;math&gt;\phi_2(v)=\phi_1(v)=\frac{1}{6}.&lt;/math&gt;

Due to the efficiency axiom, the sum of all the Shapley values is equal to 1, which means that

:&lt;math&gt;\phi_3(v) = \frac{4}{6} = \frac{2}{3}.&lt;/math&gt;

== Properties ==

The Shapley value has the following desirable properties:

'''1. Efficiency:''' The total gain is distributed:
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i\in N}\phi_i(v) = v(N)&lt;/math&gt;

'''2. Symmetry:''' If &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; are two actors who are equivalent in the sense that
:&lt;math&gt;v(S\cup\{i\}) = v(S\cup\{j\})&lt;/math&gt;
for every subset &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; which contains neither &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; nor &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\phi_i(v) = \phi_j(v)&lt;/math&gt;.

'''3. Linearity:''' If  two coalition games described by gain functions &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; are combined, then the distributed gains should correspond to the gains derived from &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; and the gains derived from &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;\phi_i(v+w) = \phi_i(v) + \phi_i(w)&lt;/math&gt;
for every &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; in&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;. Also, for any real number &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;\phi_i(a v) = a \phi_i(v)&lt;/math&gt;
for every &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; in&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;.

'''4. Zero player (null player):''' The Shapley value &lt;math&gt;\phi_i(v)&lt;/math&gt; of a null player &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; in a game &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is zero. A player &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; is ''null'' in &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;v(S\cup \{i\}) = v(S)&lt;/math&gt; for all coalitions &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; that do not contain &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;.

Given a player set &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;, the Shapley value is the only map from the set of all games to payoff vectors that satisfies ''all four'' properties 1, 2, 3, and 4 from above.

== Addendum definitions ==

'''1. Anonymous:''' If ''i'' and ''j'' are two actors, and ''w'' is the gain function that acts just like ''v'' except that the roles of ''i'' and ''j'' have been exchanged, then φ&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;(''v'') = φ&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;(''w''). In essence, this means that the labeling of the actors doesn't play a role in the assignment of their gains. Such a function is said to be ''anonymous''.

'''2. Marginalism:''' the Shapley value can be defined as a function which uses only the marginal contributions of player i as the arguments.

== Aumann–Shapley value ==
In their 1974 book, [[Lloyd Shapley]] and [[Robert Aumann]] extended the concept of the Shapley value to infinite games (defined with respect to a [[atom (measure theory)|non-atomic]] [[measure (mathematics)|measure]]), creating the diagonal formula.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Robert J. |last=Aumann |first2=Lloyd S. |last2=Shapley |title=Values of Non-Atomic Games |publisher=Princeton Univ. Press |location=Princeton |year=1974 |isbn=0-691-08103-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was later extended by [[Jean-François Mertens]] and [[Abraham Neyman]].

As seen above, the value of an n-person game associates to each player the expectation of his contribution to the worth or the coalition or players before him in a random ordering of all the players. When there are many players and each individual plays only a minor role, the set of all players preceding a given one is heuristically thought as a good sample of the players so that the value of a given infinitesimal player {{mvar|ds}} around  as "his" contribution to the worth of a "perfect" sample of the population of all players.

Symbolically, if {{mvar|v}} is the coalitional worth function associating to each coalition {{mvar|c}} measured subset of a measurable set {{mvar|I}} that can be thought as &lt;math&gt;I=[0,1]&lt;/math&gt; without loss of generality.

: &lt;math&gt;
(Sv)(ds) = \int_0^1 (v(tI + ds)- v(tI))dt.
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;(Sv)(ds)&lt;/math&gt;denotes  the Shapley value of the infinitesimal player {{mvar|ds}} in the game, {{mvar|tI}} is a perfect sample of the all-player set {{mvar|I}} containing a proportion {{mvar|t}} of all the players, and &lt;math&gt;tI+ ds&lt;/math&gt; is the coalition obtained after {{mvar|ds}} joins {{mvar|tI}}. This is the heuristic form of the [[Polygon|diagonal formula]].

Assuming some regularity of the worth function, for example assuming {{mvar|v}}  can be represented as differentiable function of a non-atomic measure on  {{mvar|I}}, {{mvar|&amp;mu;}}, &lt;math&gt;v(c)=f(\mu(c))&lt;/math&gt; with density function &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;, with &lt;math&gt;\mu(c)=\int 1_c(u)\phi(u)du,&lt;/math&gt; ( &lt;math&gt; 1_c()&lt;/math&gt; the characteristic function of {{mvar|c}}). Under such conditions

: &lt;math&gt;\mu(tI)=t\mu(I)
&lt;/math&gt;,

as can be shown by approximating the density by a step function and keeping the proportion {{mvar|t}} for each level of the density function, and

: &lt;math&gt;
v(tI + ds)=f(t\mu(I))+f'(t\mu(I))\mu(ds)
.&lt;/math&gt;

The diagonal formula has then the form developed by  Aumann and Shapley (1974)

: &lt;math&gt;
(Sv)(ds) = \int_0^1 f'_{t\mu(I)}(\mu(ds))dt
&lt;/math&gt;

Above {{mvar|&amp;mu;}} can be vector valued (as long as the function is defined and differentiable on the range of {{mvar|&amp;mu;}}, the above formula makes sense).

In the argument above if the measure contains atoms &lt;math&gt;\mu(tI)=t\mu(I)&lt;/math&gt; is no longer true—this is why the diagonal formula mostly applies to non-atomic games.

Two approaches were deployed to extend this diagonal formula when the function {{mvar|f}} is no longer differentiable. Mertens goes back to the original formula and takes the derivative after the integral thereby benefiting from the smoothing effect. Neyman took a different approach. Going back to an elementary application of Mertens's approach from Mertens (1980):&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mertens |first=Jean-François |year=1980 |title=Values and Derivatives |journal=Mathematics of Operations Research |volume=5 |issue=4 |pages=523–552 |jstor=3689325 |doi=10.1287/moor.5.4.523}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;
(Sv)(ds) =  \lim_{\epsilon \to 0, \epsilon&gt;0} \frac{1}{\epsilon}\int_0^{1-\epsilon} (f(t+\epsilon \mu(ds))-f(t))dt
&lt;/math&gt;

This works for example for majority games—while the original diagonal formula cannot be used  directly. How Mertens further extends this by identifying symmetries that the Shapley value should be invariant upon, and averaging over such symmetries to create further smoothing effect commuting averages with the derivative operation as above.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mertens |first=Jean-François |year=1988 |title=The Shapley Value in the Non Differentiable Case |journal=International Journal of Game Theory |volume=17 |issue=1 |pages=1–65 |doi=10.1007/BF01240834 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A survey for non atomic value is found in Neyman (2002)&lt;ref&gt;Neyman, A., 2002.

R.J. Aumann &amp; S. Hart (ed.).[http://ratio.huji.ac.il/dp/neyman/values.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Generalization to Coalitions ==
The Shapley value only assigns values to the individual agents.  It has been generalized&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= Owen|first= Guillermo|year=1972|title=Multilinear Extensions of Games|volume=18|issue=5|pages=64-79|doi=10.1287/mnsc.18.5.64}}&lt;/ref&gt; to apply to a group of agents C as,


&lt;math&gt;
\phi_{C}(v) = \sum_{T \subseteq N \setminus C} \frac{(n - |T| - |C|)! \; |T|!}{(n - |C| + 1)!}  \sum_{S \subseteq C}  (-1)^{|C| - |S|} v( S \cup T ) \; .

"'''Snoopy's Christmas'''" is a song performed by [[The Royal Guardsmen]] in 1967. It continues to be played as a holiday favorite on most "[[oldie]]" [[radio stations]]; however, it is also often played on radio stations playing a [[Contemporary Hit Radio|Hit Music]] format as well as [[Adult Contemporary]] format stations. While these stations wouldn't normally play music from this era radio stations will make exceptions to mix certain Christmas songs with the usual playlist during the Holiday period. Due to a chart department policy instituted by ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' magazine,{{clarify|date=December 2014}} the "Snoopy's Christmas" single never appeared in the [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]]. It was, however, shown at No. 1 on a specialty list called "Best Bets For Christmas". ''[[Cash Box]]'' magazine peaked the song at No. 10. The publication. ''Record World'', peaked the song at No. 17.{{citation needed lead|date=December 2016}}

The song, which references the [[Christmas truce]] of World War I, subsequently appeared on the album ''[[Snoopy and His Friends]]''.

==Overview==
A followup to their earlier "[[Snoopy vs. the Red Baron (song)|Snoopy vs. the Red Baron]]", the song is about how [[Snoopy]] had to go out and fight the [[Red Baron]] on [[Christmas Eve]]. The Baron has Snoopy at his mercy after a long dogfight but, instead of shooting him down he forces Snoopy to land and offers Snoopy a holiday toast. Afterward, Snoopy and the Red Baron fly their separate ways, "each knowing they'd meet on some other day".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metrolyrics.com/snoopys-christmas-lyrics-christmas-carols.html |title=Christmas Carols - Snoopy's Christmas Lyrics |publisher=Metrolyrics.com |date= |accessdate=December 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The release begins with an unknown male chorus singing the German yuletide classic "[[O Tannenbaum]]" ("O Christmas Tree"), and the middle of the song is bridged by chimes ringing out a phrase from "Hark the Herald Angels Sing". The chimes can also can be heard during the fade-out at the end of the song. The album version of the song has a simulated radio news report of failed efforts at a Christmas truce, leading to Snoopy being sent out to hunt his sworn foe.

Although fictitious, the song is set against the backdrop of a legitimate historical event. During World War I, in 1914, "[[Christmas truce|The Christmas Truce]]" was initiated not by German and British commanders, but by the soldiers themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=4085 |title=Snoopy's Christmas The Royal Guardsmen |publisher=M.songfacts.com |date=August 20, 1996 |accessdate=December 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The length of the cease-fire varied by location, and was reported to have been as brief as Christmas Day or as long as the week between Christmas and New Year's Day. Trench-bound combatants exchanged small gifts across the lines, with Germans giving beer to the British, who sent tobacco and tinned meat back in return. No Man's Land was cleared of dead bodies, trenches were repaired and drained, and troops from both sides shared pictures of their families and, in some places, used No Man's Land for friendly games of [[association football|football]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fylde.demon.co.uk/xmas.htm |title=HELLFIRE CORNER - The Christmas Truce - 1914 |publisher=Fylde.demon.co.uk |date=December 24, 1914 |accessdate=December 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The song even has the initiator correct as it was generally the German soldiers who called over to the British and initiated the truce and, in the song, it is the Red Baron—a German WWI hero—who extends the hand of Christmas friendship to Snoopy.

== Popularity in New Zealand and Australia ==

"Snoopy's Christmas" reached the No. 1 position in the New Zealand and Australia&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=4085 |title=Snoopy's Christmas by The Royal Guardsmen Songfacts |website=Songfacts.com |date= |accessdate=October 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; singles charts in 1967, and remains a popular Christmas song in those countries. The song was the fastest-selling single at the time it was originally released and is estimated to be the biggest selling overseas single sold in New Zealand in the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hughes|first1=Alistair|title=Snoopy still flying at Christmas|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/culture/9532138/Snoopy-still-flying-at-Christmas|accessdate=December 9, 2014|work=Dominion Post|publisher=Fairfax|date=December 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The song frequently reenters the New Zealand singles chart, charting in December 1987, 1988, 1989, and 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=THE ROYAL GUARDSMEN - SNOOPY'S CHRISTMAS (SONG)|url=http://charts.org.nz/showitem.asp?interpret=The+Royal+Guardsmen&amp;titel=Snoopy%27s+Christmas&amp;cat=s|website=Charts.org.nz|publisher=Hung Medien|accessdate=December 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Snoopy's Christmas" was also voted "the worst Christmas song of all time" by readers of the ''[[New Zealand Herald]]'' in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Snoopy's Christmas 'worst Christmas song of all time'|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/entertainment/news/article.cfm?c_id=1501119&amp;objectid=10483070|accessdate=December 9, 2014|work=NZ Herald|publisher=APN|date=December 18, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3293">{{Unreferenced|date=March 2009}}'''Staging''' is the process of selecting, designing, adapting to, or modifying the performance space for a [[Play (theatre)|play]] or [[film]]. This includes the use or absence of stagecraft elements as well as the structure of the [[Stage (theatre)|stage]] and its components.

Staging is also used to mean the result of this process, in other words the spectacle that a play presents in performance, its visual detail. This can include such things as positions of actors on stage (often referred to as [[blocking (stage)|blocking]]), their gestures and movements (also called stage business), the scenic background, the props and costumes, lighting, and sound effects. Besides costume, any physical object that appears in a play has the potential to become an important dramatic symbol. The first thing that the audience of a play sees is the [[Scenic design|stage set]], the physical objects that suggest the world of the play. The stage set is usually indicated by the [[playwright]], but the degree of detail and specificity of this rendering vary from one playwright to another and from one literary period to another. In film, staging is generally called ''[[Set dresser|set dressing]]''.

While from a critical standpoint, "staging" can refer to the spectacle that a play presents in performance, the term is also frequently used interchangeably with the term "blocking", referring to how the performers are placed and moved around the stage.  Many audience members may believe that performers move spontaneously on the stage, but blocking/staging is rarely spontaneous.  Major points of blocking are often set down by the playwright, but blocking is usually done by the director, sometimes in collaboration with performers and designers. In the modern theater, there are purely mechanical reasons why blocking is crucial.  Stage lighting is focused on specific parts of the stage at specific moments, and the performer must be sure to be on his or her "mark" or "spike" or they may not be well lit.  Blocking also ensures that the stage picture gives the proper focus to the proper places, and that transitions occur smoothly.  This becomes even more crucial as modern stage technology allows for ever more elaborate special effects.

When Twentieth Century Fox introduced wide-screen [[CinemaScope]] format, the head of production Darryl Zanuck repeatedly reminded his directors to take full advantage of the screen width by staging action all the way across the frame - in his words, 'keep the people spread out'. He wanted the audience to experience the full width of the new screen shape.  The 'washing line' staging demanded by Zanuck not only was a commercial imperative, it also was a practical solution for the lack of color film sensitivity as well for inability to employ [[deep focus|deep staging]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Picture Composition for Film and Television | author=Peter Ward| publisher=Focal Press| url=https://archive.org/stream/Picture_Composition_for_Film_and_Television._2nd_Editing/Picture_Composition_for_Film_and_Television._2nd_Editing_djvu.txt |date=1996 |accessdate=January 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12351">A '''tautogram''' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: ''tauto gramma'', "same letter") is a text in which all words start with the same letter. Historically, tautograms were mostly poetical forms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.listology.com/content_show.cfm/content_id.22868/Writing Poetical forms | Listology], by diaskeaus on February 15, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The difference between a tautogram and [[alliteration]] is that tautograms are a written, visual phenomenon, whereas alliterations are a [[phonetics|phonetic]] one. Most cases of alliteration are also tautograms, though certainly not all since different letters can frequently take on the same sound (e.g., '''circle segment''' or '''Catcher Ken'''). Similarly, most tautograms are also alliterations, although exceptions exist when using letters with multiple pronunciations (e.g., '''crazy child''' or '''pneumatic plate''').

In popular culture, tautogram is used in U.S. hangman game show ''[[Wheel of Fortune (U.S. game show)|Wheel of Fortune]]'' as the category 'Same Letter'.

An example of a tautogram in Russian is a poem by V. Smirenskiy with all words starting with "L":

Ленивых лет легко ласканье,&lt;br /&gt;
Луга лиловые люблю,&lt;br /&gt;
Ловлю левкоев ликованье,&lt;br /&gt;
Легенды ломкие ловлю.&lt;br /&gt;

Лазурь ласкающих лесов.&lt;br /&gt;
Люблю лукавых лилий лепет,&lt;br /&gt;
Летящий ладан лепестков.

Another example of a tautogram in Russian is a story with all words starting with "P".

Пётр Петрович Петухов, поручик пятьдесят пятого Подольского пехотного полка, получил по почте письмо, полное приятных пожеланий. «Приезжайте, — писала прелестная Полина Павловна Перепёлкина, — поговорим, помечтаем, потанцуем, погуляем, посетим полузабытый, полузаросший пруд, порыбачим. Приезжайте, Пётр Петрович, поскорее погостить».

Петухову предложение понравилось. Прикинул: приеду. Прихватил полуистёртый полевой плащ, подумал: пригодится.

Поезд прибыл после полудня. Принял Петра Петровича почтеннейший папа Полины Павловны, Павел Пантелеймонович. «Пожалуйста, Пётр Петрович, присаживайтесь поудобнее», — проговорил папаша. Подошёл плешивенький племянник, представился: «Порфирий Платонович Поликарпов. Просим, просим».

Появилась прелестная Полина. Полные плечи прикрывал прозрачный персидский платок. Поговорили, пошутили, пригласили пообедать. Подали пельмени, плов, пикули, печёнку, паштет, пирожки, пирожное, пол-литра померанцевой. Плотно пообедали. Пётр Петрович почувствовал приятное пресыщение.

После приёма пищи, после плотного перекуса Полина Павловна пригласила Петра Петровича прогуляться по парку. Перед парком простирался полузабытый полузаросший пруд. Прокатились под парусами. После плавания по пруду пошли погулять по парку.

«Присядем», — предложила Полина Павловна. Присели. Полина Павловна придвинулась поближе. Посидели, помолчали. Прозвучал первый поцелуй. Пётр Петрович притомился, предложил полежать, подстелил полуистёртый полевой плащ, подумал: пригодился. Полежали, повалялись, повлюблялись. «Пётр Петрович – проказник, прохвост», — привычно проговорила Полина Павловна.

«Поженим, поженим!», — прошептал плешивенький племянник. «Поженим, поженим», — пробасил подошедший папаша. Пётр Петрович побледнел, пошатнулся, потом побежал прочь. Побежав, подумал: «Полина Петровна – прекрасная партия, полноте париться».

Перед Петром Петровичем промелькнула перспектива получить прекрасное поместье. Поспешил послать предложение. Полина Павловна приняла предложение, позже поженились. Приятели приходили поздравлять, приносили подарки. Передавая пакет, приговаривали: «Прекрасная пара».

An example of a tautogram in Ukrainian is a poem with all words starting with "S":

Сипле, стелить сад самотній&lt;br /&gt; 
Сірий смуток, срібний сніг.&lt;br /&gt;
Сумно стогне сонний струмінь,&lt;br /&gt;
Серце слуха скорбний сміх.&lt;br /&gt;
Серед саду страх сіріє.&lt;br /&gt;
Сад солодкий спокій снить.&lt;br /&gt;
Сонно сиплються сніжинки.&lt;br /&gt;
Струмінь стомлено сичить.&lt;br /&gt;
Стихли струни, стихли співи,&lt;br /&gt;
Срібні співи серенад,&lt;br /&gt;
Срібно стеляться сніжинки —&lt;br /&gt;
Спить самотній сад.

Another example of a tautogram in Ukrainian is a story with all words starting with "P":

"Перший поцілунок".
"Популярному перемиському поету Павлові Петровичу Подільчаку прийшло поштою приємне повідомлення? "Приїздіть, Павле Петровичу, - писав поважний правитель Підгорецького повіту Полікарп Пантелеймонович Паскевич, - погостюєте, повеселитеся". Павло Петрович поспішив, прибувши першим поїздом. Підгорецький палац Паскевичів привітно прийняв приїжджого поета. Потім під'їхали поважні персони - приятелі Паскевичів... Посадили Павла Петровича поряд панночки - премилої Поліпи Полікарпівни. Поговорили про політику, погоду. Павло Петрович прочитав підібрані пречудові поезії. Поліна Полікарпі пограла прекрасні полонези Понятовського, прелюдії Пучіні. Поспівали, пісень, потанцювали падеспан, польку. Прийшла пора - попросили пообідати. Поставили повні підноси пляшок: портвейну, плиски, пшеничної, підігрітого пуншу, пива, принесли печених поросят, приправлених перцем, півники, пахучі паляниці, печінковий паштет, пухкі пампушки під печеричною підливою, пироги, підсмажені пляцки. Потім подали пряники, персикове повидло, помаранчі, повні порцелянові полумиски полуниць, порічок. Почувши приємну повноту, Павло Петрович подумав про панночку. Поліна Полікарпівна попросила прогулятися Підгорецьким парком, помилуватися природою, послухати пташині переспіви. Пропозиція повністю підійшла прихмілілому поету. Походили, погуляли... Порослий папороттю прадавній парк подарував приємну прохолоду. Повітря п'янило принадними пахощами. Побродивши парком, пара присіла під порослим плющем платаном. Посиділи, помріяли, позітхали, пошепталися, пригорнулися. Почувсь перший поцілунок: прощай, парубоче привілля, пора поету приймакувати".

'''''The Critic''''' is an American [[List of prime time animated television series|prime time animated series]] revolving around the life of New York film critic [[Jay Sherman]], voiced by actor [[Jon Lovitz]]. It was created by writing partners [[Al Jean]] and [[Mike Reiss]], who had previously worked as writers and showrunners (seasons 3 and 4) on ''[[The Simpsons]]''. ''The Critic'' had 23 episodes produced, first broadcast on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] in 1994, and finishing its original run on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] in 1995. According to [[PopMatters]], "the creators [said] they intended the series as their 'love letter to New York.'"&lt;ref name="popmatters1"&gt;[http://www.popmatters.com/review/critic-complete-series/ The Critic: The Complete Series | PopMatters&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Episodes featured movie parodies with notable examples including a musical version of ''[[Apocalypse Now]]'', ''[[Howard Stern|Howard Stern's End]]'' (''[[Howards End (film)|Howards End]]''), ''Honey, I Ate the Kids'' (''[[Honey, I Shrunk the Kids]]/[[The Silence of the Lambs (film)|The Silence of the Lambs]]''), ''The Cockroach King'' (''[[The Lion King]]''), ''Abe Lincoln: Pet Detective'' (''[[Ace Ventura: Pet Detective]]''), ''Scent of a Jackass'' and ''Scent of a Wolfman'' (''[[Scent of a Woman (1992 film)|Scent of a Woman]]'').&lt;ref name="pacino-wolfman"&gt;{{youtube|CYZr8wSkvXo|Scent of a Wolfman}}. {{Retrieved|accessdate=November 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show often referenced popular movies such as ''[[Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory]]'' and ''[[The Godfather]]'', and routinely lampooned actor [[Marlon Brando]]&lt;ref name="brando-wow"&gt;{{youtube|usegltieVAY|The Critic – Apocalypse WOW}}. {{Retrieved|accessdate=November 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="brando-barney"&gt;{{youtube|pMJizB9RaiY|Marlon Brando in the Barney the Dinosaur Movie}}. {{Retrieved|accessdate=November 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and actor/director [[Orson Welles]].&lt;ref name="orson-peas"&gt;{{youtube|IH1PJTY9AVA|Rosebud Frozen Peas}}. {{Retrieved|accessdate=November 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="orson-fishsticks"&gt;{{youtube|Za3EuqU385k|Mrs. Pell's Fishsticks}}. {{Retrieved|accessdate=November 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also spoofed [[Dudley Moore]], usually as his character Arthur Bach from the 1981 film ''[[Arthur (1981 film)|Arthur]]''.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Critic'' was cancelled after two seasons. It continued to air through reruns on [[Comedy Central]] and then on [[Locomotion (TV channel)|Locomotion]]. From February 1, 2000, to 2001, ten [[webisode]]s were later produced using [[Adobe Shockwave]], and were broadcast on [[Atom.com|AtomFilms.com]] and [[Shockwave (game portal)|Shockwave.com]]. In 2004, the DVD box set was released, which includes all 23 TV episodes (in their original production order) and the webisodes.&lt;ref name="tviv3"&gt;[http://tviv.org/The_Critic/The_Complete_Series The Critic/The Complete Series at The TV IV]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 2000s, reruns of the show aired again on [[ReelzChannel]] in the US and on [[Teletoon (Canadian TV channel)|Teletoon]]'s programming block [[Teletoon at Night]] in Canada. As of 2016, the first season can be viewed for free on [[Sony Crackle|Crackle]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.crackle.com&lt;/ref&gt;

==Premise==
The show follows the life of 36-year-old film critic from New York named [[List of The Critic characters#Jay Prescott Sherman|Jay Prescott Sherman]]. His televised review show is called ''Coming Attractions'', which airs on the Philips Broadcasting cable network. He is often viewed in-universe as "cold, mean-spirited, and elitist".&lt;ref name="books.google_b" /&gt; His signature line, upon seeing a terrible movie, is "It stinks!" Each episode is full of film references and parodies. Some of the secondary characters that are a part of Jay's story include his nutty adoptive father, his well-meaning son Marty, the Australian movie star Jeremy Hawke, Margo—the biological child of his adoptive parents, his snide make-up lady Doris, and his boss Duke Phillips. In the second season, Jay acquired a love interest—a Southern woman named Alice Tompkins, who later became his long-term girlfriend.

==Production==
The show was created by [[Al Jean]] and [[Mike Reiss]], who along with [[James L. Brooks]] served as executive producers. ''The Critic'' was produced by [[Gracie Films]] in association with [[Columbia Pictures Television]]. The show's animation was done by [[Film Roman]]. It was co-produced by [[Patric Verrone]].

The show sometimes included appearances of real life critics, such as [[Gene Shallit]], [[Gene Siskel]], and [[Roger Ebert]], who provided their own voices.&lt;ref name="books.google_b"&gt;{{Cite journal | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=EGtTOAGYSWQC&amp;pg=PA103&amp;dq=%22jay+sherman%22+%22the+critic%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22jay%20sherman%22%20%22the%20critic%22&amp;f=false | title = Drawn to Television: Prime-Time Animation from the Flintstones to Family Guy | isbn = 0275990192 | author1 = Keith Booker | first1 = M | date = 2006-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; When choosing things to parody, Reiss and Jean made a conscious decision to find the right balance between current pop culture, and references that would stand the test of time.&lt;ref name="youtube_a"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQf0kYp7eP0&amp;list=PLcFR1vH6onb5Q53P-36wEpnJAfVFC1q7a |title=The Critic DVD Extras – Creating The Critic |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2013-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Critic'' was "the first major non-family sitcom animated program to appear in primetime."&lt;ref name="books.google_b" /&gt; The show started out on ABC on January 26, 1994, where it aired 13 episodes. It was cancelled by the network after half a season, and was then moved onto [[20th Century Fox Television|Fox]] the following year where it ran for another ten episode season. Around this time, it was included in a "shameless plug" crossover with ''[[The Simpsons]]'' (in their episode "[[A Star Is Burns]]") and assumed the timeslot immediately after the show in the TV schedule, in an attempt to popularize it.&lt;ref name=Turner&gt;{{cite book |last=Turner |first=Chris |authorlink=Chris Turner (author) |title=[[Planet Simpson|Planet Simpson: How a Cartoon Masterpiece Documented an Era and Defined a Generation]] |others=Introduction by [[Douglas Coupland]]. |edition=1st revised |year=2005 |location=London |publisher=[[Ebury Press]] |oclc=56457550 |isbn=978-0-09-190336-7 |page=133}}&lt;/ref&gt; But despite improvement of the ratings,&lt;ref name="aljean" /&gt;&lt;ref name="avclub" /&gt; Fox moved it to a different timeslot after five episodes, and also cancelled it after this run had finished airing in May 1995.&lt;ref name=Turner/&gt; According to ''The TV IV'', nine scripts were already written for the planned third season and the show was going to be moved to [[UPN]], but an agreement was not reached,&lt;ref name="tviv1"&gt;[http://tviv.org/The_Critic The Critic at The TV IV]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tviv2"&gt;[http://tviv.org/The_Critic/Season_Two The Critic/Season Two at The TV IV]&lt;/ref&gt;. Also, Fox refused to officially cancel the show until much later.&lt;ref name="tviv1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="tviv2" /&gt; The show was not renewed on any network, and effectively became cancelled. The show returned in Flash-animated webisode form in 2000–2001, for a third season with 10 three- to five-minute installments.

===Design===
Four people have a design credit on the show: [[David Silverman (animator)|David Silverman]], [[Rich Moore]], David Cutler, and [[Everett Peck]]. Silverman designed the look of Jay Sherman. Moore and Cutler designed the general look of the show including some of the backgrounds and supporting cast. The character of Doris was based on Peck's drawings. Cutler helped in the hard task of standardizing all these animation styles. Moore was the supervising director, so oversaw a lot of the design process—and was also responsible for how the action would play out, and how each shot would be framed. Rich Moore explains "the design of Jay Sherman began as a sketch done by David Silverman" on a napkin/place-mat in a restaurant. He was designed as "[[Andy Kaufman|Kaufmanesque]]," and Jim Brooks liked the design, so his design remained much the same for the pilot episode. Moore had his reservations as the character had a "flat head and tiny eyes that were hard to act with", and was composed of shapes that were difficult to turn in a 3D space. It was decided the drawing encapsulated the humanity and reality of the critic, so was left unchanged. Over the course of the two seasons, however, the design was altered slightly. The flat head was made more round, and his eyes became bigger—in order to make Sherman more appealing and more easily animatable. The design team never intended to make the characters too cartoony as it would not have fit tonally with the type of show. The characters were designed via a general think-tank process of "what do we like about the characters and what are we trying to say about them?". Quick sketches were completed in front of the full creative team after a discussion about characters, which were then critically analysed. In particular, the design of the parents caused some issues. Jim Brooks described the father as a "crazy [[White Anglo-Saxon Protestant|wasp]]." The designs were eventually based on a photo of a professor and his wife. Moore explains that the animation should never "step on the voices or the writing."&lt;ref name="youtube_a" /&gt;

===Casting===
Jean and Reiss had a lot of trouble casting the voice for Margo, Jay's sister. [[Nancy Cartwright]] was eventually given the role. She used a voice very similar to her natural one. [[Christine Cavanaugh]] was cast as Marty. Duke Phillips, Jay's [[Ted Turner]]-esque boss was played by [[Charles Napier (actor)|Charles Napier]], using his real voice. Due to the sheer number of film and TV parodies, the team also sought character actors who could play many different roles. During the audition process, they asked them to perform their acts, which Reiss described as "very entertaining." [[Maurice LaMarche]] impressed Jean by doing "perfect" impressions. LaMarche even beat out genuine Australians for the role of Australian actor Jeremy Hawke. He was often asked to work on his accent of a pop culture figure related to media just released or that would have been released by the time of the episode's airing. Depending on who could do the voice better, the characters were divided up between [[Nick Jameson]] and LaMarche. Each would play about 20–30 characters per show. According to LaMarche, he played twenty-seven characters in one episode.&lt;ref name="books.google_a"&gt;{{Cite journal | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=0cEAOsLJad8C&amp;pg=PA212&amp;dq=%22jay+sherman%22+%22the+critic%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22jay%20sherman%22%20%22the%20critic%22&amp;f=false | title = The Magic Behind the Voices: A Who's Who of Cartoon Voice Actors | isbn = 1578066964 | author1 = Lawson | first1 = Tim | last2 = Persons | first2 = Alisa | date = 2004-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; He specialized in impressions, while Jameson's specialty was accents and dialects.&lt;ref name="youtube_a" /&gt;

==Relationship with ''The Simpsons''==
''[[The A.V. Club]]'' explains "in creating ''The Critic'', Al Jean and Mike Reiss set out to make the show as dissimilar from ''[[The Simpsons]]'' as humanly possible".&lt;ref name="avclub_a"&gt;{{cite web|last=Rabin |first=Nathan |url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/the-critic,64538/ |title=The Critic &amp;#124; The Critic &amp;#124; TV Club &amp;#124; TV |publisher=The A.V. Club |date=2011-11-06 |accessdate=2013-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, there are many similarities between the two series. ''Gen X TV: The Brady Bunch to Melrose Place'' argues that ''The Critic'' became a critical success while other animated shows of the early 1990s flopped was because "the makers of these shows failed to realize that ''The Simpsons'' didn't become a hit because of animation [but] because of its style of humor", and says that ''The Critic'' understood this. It adds the show "took the media-obsession/parody portions of ''The Simpsons'' and created separate show around them".&lt;ref name="books.google_c"&gt;{{Cite journal | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=NIsAu5PqgqQC&amp;pg=PA66&amp;dq=%22jay+sherman%22+%22the+critic%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22jay%20sherman%22%20%22the%20critic%22&amp;f=false | title = Gen X TV: The Brady Bunch to Melrose Place | isbn = 0815605854 | author1 = Owen | first1 = Rob | year = 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Planet Simpson]]'' describes the show as "the closest thing ''The Simpsons'' ever had to a spin-off."&lt;ref name=Turner/&gt; ''The Critic'' also shares ''The Simpsons''{{'}} love for criticizing Fox and the audience, such as Jay's frequent line "You're watching Fox, shame on you" and "''The Critic'' will be right back, you TV-addicted couch monkeys"&lt;ref name="Critic Commercial Break ID"&gt;{{youtube|_lSM6koJVzw|The Critic Will Be Right Back}}&lt;/ref&gt; before the show went to commercial break.&lt;ref name="books.google_c" /&gt; ''The A.V. Club'' says "''The Critic'' made its protagonist the anti-[[Homer Simpson]]. Where Homer is a booze-sodden everyman, Jay Sherman is an unabashed elitist. Where Homer is a rudely physical creature, Jay leads a life of the mind. Homer is a slob. Jay is a snob."&lt;ref name="avclub_a" /&gt; While "Springfield is very aggressively and deliberately Anywhere, United States, ''The Critic'' is an extended Valentine to a certain kind of pointy-headed East Coast elitism."&lt;ref name="avclub_a" /&gt; [[PopMatters]] said "''The Critic''{{'}}s humor is very much in the spirit of ''The Simpsons'', taken in a more brazenly surreal direction."&lt;ref name="popmatters1"/&gt;

[[Matt Groening]] had no part in its inception, and wanted to make this very clear, so he would not be associated with any success or failure the show would have. He claimed that in the public consciousness, this was his show—a direct spin-off to ''The Simpsons''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=TaWwn2Tk4S0C&amp;pg=PA219&amp;dq=%22jay+sherman%22+%22the+critic%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22jay%20sherman%22%20%22the%20critic%22&amp;f=false | title = Simpsons Confidential: The Uncensored, Totally Unauthorized Account of the World's Greatest TV Show by the People that Made it | isbn = 9780091927295 | author1 = Ortved | first1 = John | year = 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many voice actors appear in both ''The Simpsons'' and ''The Critic'', and regulars on both shows have made cameos in the others. For example, [[Nancy Cartwright]], [[Doris Grau]], [[Tress MacNeille]], [[Russi Taylor]], and Jon Lovitz have all played primary/secondary characters on both shows. [[Maurice LaMarche]], who played many characters on ''The Critic'', "played [[George C. Scott]] getting hit in the groin with a football" in the crossover episode. His only line was "Ow, my groin." He also did Jay's belch in the episode.&lt;ref name="books.google_a" /&gt;

===Crossovers===
In "Dukerella", Jay and Alice attend a costume ball dressed as [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] and [[Marge Simpson|Marge]].&lt;ref name="books.google_b" /&gt; Homer and [[Bart Simpson]] made a brief appearance in "Dial M for Mother". During an interview with [[Geraldo Rivera]], Jay is asked about talking over the heads of his audience and does just that in his answer. An annoyed family watching changes the channel to ''[[The Simpsons]]'', where Homer—after stepping on a rake—exclaims, "[[D'oh]]!" and Bart replies, "Ay caramba!" The family's father comments, "Now, this I understand." This can be seen as a suggestion that ''The Simpsons'' is relatively low-brow.&lt;ref name="books.google_b" /&gt;

In "[[A Star Is Burns]]", Jay makes a guest appearance on ''The Simpsons'' presiding over a local [[film festival]]. When Jay enters the Simpson household, Bart is watching a ''[[The Flintstones|Flintstones]]''-''[[The Jetsons|Jetsons]]'' [[The Jetsons Meet the Flintstones|crossover show]], which he criticizes; he then praises Jay and ''Coming Attractions''/''The Critic'', before shuddering and saying to himself "I feel so ''dirty''." At the end of the episode, as he is leaving for New York, Jay offers the Simpsons to appear on ''Coming Attractions''/''The Critic'', but Bart declines, saying, "Nah, we're not going to be doing that." Jay has yellow skin when he appears on ''The Simpsons'' but pink skin on ''The Critic''.&lt;ref name="mikereiss"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This episode caused some conflict between ''Simpsons'' creator [[Matt Groening]] and [[executive producer]] [[James L. Brooks]]. Groening decided to take his name off the credits and did not appear in the DVD commentary. He publicly complained about the episode, which went to air in the end. He said "for more than six months I tried to convince Jim Brooks and everyone connected with the show not to do such a cynical thing, which would surely be perceived by the fans as nothing more than a pathetic attempt to...advertise ''The Critic'' at the expense of the integrity of ''The Simpsons''." In response, Brooks said "[Groening] is a gifted, adorable, cuddly ingrate. But his behavior right now is rotten. And, it's not pretty when a rich man acts like this."&lt;ref name="Turner" /&gt;

Jay appeared briefly on ''The Simpsons'' a few more times. In the episode "[[Hurricane Neddy]]," he was in an insane asylum apparently unable to say anything more than his catchphrase (Doctor: "Yes, Mr. Sherman. ''Everything'' stinks.") In the episode "[[The Ziff Who Came to Dinner]]," he is seen at [[Moe Szyslak|Moe's Tavern]] with all the other characters on the show that Lovitz voices or has voiced.&lt;ref&gt;Weinstein, Josh. (2006) Commentary for "[[Hurricane Neddy]]", in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Eighth Season'' [DVD]. [[20th Century Fox]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hallmarks==
Much like the [[The Simpsons opening sequence|opening sequence in ''The Simpsons'']] with its [[Chalkboard gag|chalkboard]], [[Sax solo gag|sax solo]], and [[couch gag]]s, ''The Critic'' has a distinctive opening sequence featuring minor gags. Jay is always awakened by a disquieting phone call or radio news report, and eventually watches a clip that parodies a well-known movie before delivering the same negative opinion: '''"It stinks!"''' He watches the closing credits in a movie theater and delivers a comeback line to an usher who tells him the show is over.

==Themes==
One of the main elements featured on ''The Critic'' is the lampooning of the entertainment industry. ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' explains "Mike Reiss and Al Jean-written episodes of ''[[The Simpsons]]'' are often defined by a high number of parodies, spoofs and homages. In their episodes, the Simpsons are always watching television or going to the movies. They didn't need any such excuse for film parodies on ''The Critic'' since Jay's life was inherently and organically filled with film. It proved the perfect delivery system for an endless series of clever, bite-sized spoofs."&lt;ref name="avclub_a" /&gt; The book ''I'm an English Major--Now What?'' epitomises this by recounting a scene where Jay is forced to rate movies "on a scale of good to excellent"—thereby negating his credibility as a film critic. Sherman says "but what if I won't like something," to which his boss Duke replies, "That's what good is for." This shows the corruption of an industry that aims to provide unbiased thoughtful analyses of films, due to bribery and politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=eaZUAerh4HMC&amp;pg=PA84&amp;dq=%22jay+sherman%22+%22the+critic%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22jay%20sherman%22%20%22the%20critic%22&amp;f=false | title = I'm an English Major--Now What?: How English Majors Can Find Happiness, Success, and a Real Job | isbn = 1599633299 | last1 = Lemire | first1 = Timothy | place= Cincinnati |publisher= Writer's Digest Books| year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example is in the June 22 episode "L.A. Jay," where after trying to break into the movie business by writing a script, which is revealed to be rather good, a studio buys it off him for $100,000 in order to bury it, thereby keeping quality out of the industry.&lt;ref name="books.google_b" /&gt; While episodes typically dealt with his private life, Jay's position as a film critic "offer[ed] numerous opportunities for the show to satirize the film industry, establishing a dialogue with popular culture" in a very similar way to what ''The Simpsons'' had already been doing for years.&lt;ref name="books.google_b" /&gt;

''The Critic'' often made fun of celebrities, sometimes in rather mean-spirited ways. ''Drawn to Television'' cites the fat jokes directed at [[Marlon Brando]] or [[Orson Welles]].&lt;ref name="books.google_b" /&gt; ''The Critic'' also frequently comments on television. For example, one episode criticizes a character's project to colorize a series of classic [[black-and-white]] films for broadcast on a cable channel. The process involves making the films "more attractive to a contemporary audience" by "inserting computer-generated happy endings."&lt;ref name="books.google_b" /&gt; The article "Ten Frighteningly Prophetic Parodies from ‘The Critic'" explores the show's spoofs that "have come true (or close to true), proving that there really isn't anything that's too stupid for Hollywood to make"—an almost meta-satirical statement in that things that the writer thought were too ridiculous to be true at the time, ended up coming to fruition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Josh |last= Kurp |url=http://www.uproxx.com/tv/2011/07/ten-frighteningly-prophetic-parodies-from-the-critic/ |title=Ten Frighteningly Prophetic Parodies from 'The Critic' |publisher=UPROXX |date=2013-02-04 |accessdate=2013-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

GrabBagCinema said, "What was great about this show, was that it always knew how to make you laugh and poke fun at celebrities, and their movies. It was so well written because it really understood movies, celebrities, Hollywood and humour. If you weren't a movie buff, you probably couldn't appreciate it or enjoy it. But if you were, you understood the references and saw the effort the writers and animators put in, to recapture the movies you grew up loving and remembering... but they did it with clever humour that wouldn't offend you. But the best element of this show was that Jay Sherman would review films honestly. And even though he loved classic cinema and original story telling, he would still be honest and say he didn't like it. It's just a shame real life critics and reviewers cannot do the same."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| first= Jade| last= Lindley |url=http://www.grabbagcinema.com/editorial/the-critic-have-we-forgotten-how-to-accept-film/ |title=The Critic: Have We Forgotten How To Accept Film?|website= GrabBagCinema.com |date= 13 April 2013| deadurl= yes| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140102192205/http://www.grabbagcinema.com/editorial/the-critic-have-we-forgotten-how-to-accept-film/| archivedate= January 2, 2014| accessdate= 3 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

===Contemporaneous===
''The Critic'' originally received mixed to positive reviews when it first aired. In 1994, The ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' gave a typical review of the show with, "Jay Sherman, the eponymous culture vulture of ''The Critic'', would undoubtedly say his new animated comedy on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] 'stinks.' Fortunately for him [The Critic] smells pretty good to me."&lt;ref&gt;[http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=CSTB&amp;p_theme=cstb&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EB4217DEE41FA78&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM Chicago Sun-Times:: Search&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The show has since developed a [[cult following]],&lt;ref name="aljean" /&gt;&lt;ref name="broadcastingcable"&gt;{{cite web

In September 2006, [[IGN]] ranked ''The Critic'' 9th in their list of the ''Top 25 Primetime Animated Series of All Time''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tv.ign.com/articles/736/736051p4.html IGN - Top 25 Primetime Animated Series of All Time (page 4)]&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2009, they ranked the show 26th in their other list of the ''Top 100 Best Animated TV Series''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090301101321/http://tv.ign.com/top-100-animated-tv-series/26.html IGN - Top 100 Best Animated TV Series]&lt;/ref&gt; In the latter article, IGN said: "Of all the projects completed by ex-Saturday Night Live players, ''The Critic'' is the most fully realized, hilarious and heartwarming.

''[[People (magazine)|People]]'' magazine gave it a B, saying "This animated series is slyly amusing when sticking it to showbiz, taking sarcastic swipes at everyone from [[Steven Seagal]] to [[Gene Shalit]]. At its best, it's still several strides behind the savage, protean wit of ''The Simpsons'', and the humor sputters when the focus is personal."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hiltbrand |first=David |url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20107370,00.html |title=Picks and Pans Review: The Critic |publisher=People.com |date= |accessdate=2013-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the third season, IGN said "I was thrilled to find out that [[Gracie Films]] has started producing new episodes of the cancelled ABC/Fox/Comedy Central show ''The Critic''—and for web cartoons that don't depend on the violence/swear cop-out for the humor, the shows are actually really well produced."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://au.ign.com/articles/2001/01/23/the-critic-interviews-pikachu |title=The Critic Interviews Pikachu – IGN |publisher=Au.ign.com |date=2001-01-22 |accessdate=2013-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early on in its run, ''[[Siskel and Ebert]]'' did a review of the show. It was the only television series they ever reviewed. Some of the criticisms they provided, if left unattended to, may have been factors to the show's cancellation. They said the show doesn't have as many memorable characters as ''The Simpsons'', and encouraged the writers to work on that. They said the second episode was a let down because "it didn't seem to be about the world of a movie critic," and was instead about "a single dad and his geeky son." They said the jokes involving Jay's dad get tiresome, and that the station boss isn't as sharp a parody as he could be. [[Gene Siskel]] said, "if ''The Critic'' is gonna succeed—and I hope it does—it desperately needs to refocus itself on the movies and the way critics interact with them." He added that the show needs a second critic, and jokingly said he and [[Roger Ebert]] should (and would love to) save the show by writing scripts for them. Ebert said the show should have 2 to 3 movie/genre parodies per episode. He added he would like to see Jay watch television to allow the show to satirize that medium as well. This would focus the show on the media, and not let it become another show about a man and his problems. Siskel said the writers should keep Jay as a smart critic. Regardless of his personality, if his critiques are witty and intelligent, by extension the show's satire becomes much sharper.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wqm-dVF-Sdk#!

===Later analysis===
AOL TV published an article in 2009 entitled ''Gone Too Soon: The Critic'', in which they analyzed the cancellation of the show. It said "The creators and Lovitz seem to [care about the show], as there are always talks cropping up of a revival of ''The Critic'', either as an animated project, or possibly a live-action one. There are fan sites out there, but as time passes with no new material, many of these are becoming floating time capsules".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aoltv.com/2009/11/17/gone-too-soon-the-critic/ |title=Gone Too Soon: The Critic |publisher=Aoltv.com |date= |accessdate=2013-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plus, a lot of effort was put into the release of the DVD (for which there was a lot of demand), meaning there is still a fan base as well as a passionate cast and crew.&lt;ref name="youtube_a" /&gt;

''Drawn to Television'' says that like Jay's show-within-a-show Coming Attractions, "audiences never quite warmed up to Sherman and his surrounding cast of characters" in ''The Critic'', perhaps due to the lack of warmth between character interactions in both shows.&lt;ref name="books.google_b" /&gt; The book ''[[The Magic Behind the Voices]]'' put its cancellation down to "so-so ratings and network politics."&lt;ref name="books.google_a" /&gt; ''[[Planet Simpson]]'' says it "failed to click with Simpsons fans."&lt;ref name=Turner/&gt; In 1994, Austin American-Statesman said "''The Critic'' never had a prayer on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], where the comedy overload consists of domestic sitcoms".&lt;ref&gt;[http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=AASB&amp;p_theme=aasb&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EAD95CE12A5947C&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM NewsBank for Statesman | www.prod.statesman.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The show is generally considered one of the great TV shows cancelled too early into its run. The ''[[Columbia Spectator]]'' said the show was "one of television's great lost causes."&lt;ref name="columbiaspectator"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.columbiaspectator.com/2004/02/06/two-big-sarcastic-thumbs| title = Two Big, Sarcastic Thumbs Up| first = Ben| last = Kenigsberg| publisher = [[Columbia Spectator|http://www.columbiaspectator.com]]| date = February 6, 2010| accessdate = November 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Voice actor [[Maurice LaMarche]] considered ''The Critic'' one of his "personal favorites," saying "I would almost give anything to bring back ''The Critic'', along with ''[[Pinky and the Brain]]''; those are the two most satisfying jobs I've ever had."&lt;ref name="books.google_a" /&gt; Ogeeku said "This show did not last as long as it should have and that is truly a shame. ''The Critic'' was in its time, one of the greatest animated shows ever made and one of the funniest shows period on television."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ogeeku.com/annoy-snotsnit-issue-4-critic/ |title=Things That Annoy Snotsnit Issue 4: Things Which Aren’t The Critic |publisher=Ogeeku |date=2012-03-19 |accessdate=2013-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reiss thinks the show holds up very well.&lt;ref name="youtube_a" /&gt;

[[PopMatters]] said "The animated Jay Sherman...is perfect for Lovitz. He may never find anything in live action that serves him quite so well. I don't mean that as a dig at his comic abilities (or his looks); it's just that Sherman is an ideal outlet for the actor's ham." It said the cartoon format allows for "his two biggest strengths as a performer: sarcasm and ironic overacting." It added "A marriage of voice-acting, writing, and animation that rivals some of the best [[Pixar]] work, Sherman is nonetheless hampered occasionally by the writers' over-sampling from the [[Homer Simpson]] playbook, mainly gags concerning Jay's girth and accompanying appetites. More effectively."&lt;ref name="popmatters1"/&gt; PopMatters said "when it originally aired...the series was (for better or worse) slightly ahead of its time, outlandish in a way that ''The Simpsons'' would not adopt until later. Rewatching it now, ''The Critic'' seems most similar stylistically to the more recent series ''[[Family Guy]]'', with its frequent cutaway gags...and blurring of fantasy and reality. ''The Simpsons'' introduced these qualities in moderation; ''The Critic'' and ''Family Guy'' are addicted to them, sometimes to a crippling degree." It explained that "The reference-heavy, media-saturated, sketch-like structure works better for ''The Critic'' than ''Family Guy'', though, because the former is less in love with itself and its desire to shock or offend. Indeed, it's more strange than twisted, Unlike ''Family Guy'', it has a frame of reference beyond television, beyond even its self-created film niche." It adds that "The satire isn't always as biting as it could be; many of the movie parodies eschew real critique in favor of non sequiturs or homage. Too often the writers rely on audience familiarity with popular movies. It's amusing to be sure, but rarely as deadpan hilarious as ''The Simpsons'' parade of fabricated [[Troy McClure]] B-movies."&lt;ref name="popmatters1"/&gt;

'''Turkeys voting for Christmas''' is an English [[idiom]] used as a [[metaphor]]  or [[simile]] (in the construct "like turkeys voting for Christmas") in reference to an apparently suicidal ("death-wish"&lt;ref name=ox/&gt;) choice, especially a political vote against one's [[self-interest]]. In modern times, in the [[United Kingdom]], turkeys are commonly eaten as part of the [[Christmas dinner#United Kingdom|English Christmas dinner]]. Since 1573 they have been available in the UK at Christmas.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Harland]] (1858). [https://books.google.com/books?id=AwAVAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA1059 ''The house and farm accounts of the Shuttleworths of Gawthorpe Hall in the county of Lancaster at Smithils and Gawthorpe: from September 1582 to October 1621'']. p.1059. Chetham society,&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Oxford Dictionary of Humorous Quotations'' writes that a commentator in the ''[[Independent Magazine]]'' traced the origin of the phrase to British [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] politician [[David Penhaligon]],&lt;ref name=ox&gt;"Oxford Dictionary of Humorous Quotations", by Ned Sherrin, ''[[Oxford University Press]]'', Edition 4, 2008, {{ISBN|0-19-923716-6}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=5q4XBa5jsy8C&amp;pg=PR20&amp;dq=%22turkeys+voting+for+christmas%22&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=%22turkeys%20voting%20for%20christmas%22&amp;f=false "Introduction to the first edition"]&lt;/ref&gt; who is quoted as saying: "Us voting for the Pact is like a turkey voting for Christmas" in reference to the 1977 [[Lib-Lab Pact]] which he opposed.&lt;ref&gt;"The pact: the inside story of the Lib-Lab government, 1977-8", by Alistair Michie, Simon Hoggart, ''[[Quartet Books]]'', 1978, [https://books.google.com/books?ei=QV_8S9G0LYHgNei0nKkB&amp;ct=result&amp;id=3RhaAAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=Turkeys+Christmas+penhaligon&amp;q=Christmas+ p. 156]&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase was soon borrowed by other politicians and public figures.&lt;ref name=ox/&gt; In 1979 Labour Prime Minister [[James Callaghan]] was faced with a [[1979 vote of no confidence in the government of James Callaghan|vote of no confidence]] called by Scottish nationalists, who were upset with Labour's treatment of a recent [[Scottish devolution referendum, 1979|Scottish devolution referendum]]. In the resulting vote the Scottish nationalists sided with the Conservative opposition against the Labour government, despite the fact that the Conservatives opposed devolution. During his speech, Callaghan stated that "If they win, there will be a general election. I am told that the current joke going around the House is that it is the first time in recorded history that turkeys have been known to vote for an early Christmas." The [[Scottish National Party]] ultimately lost most of its representation in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1979|resulting election]].

in 2000 British MP [[Teresa Gorman]], who opposed the [[Maastricht Treaty]], stated; "If the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] voted for Maastricht it would be like 651 turkeys voting for Christmas."&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.gazette-news.co.uk/2000/2/18/207686.html "Billericay: The Dame who didn't give a damn..."], ''Daily Gazette'', 18 February 2000 {{Dead link|date=June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A prominent anecdotal example was displayed in the UK in 2016, whereby areas which were net beneficiaries of EU subsidies voted by a majority to leave the EU and then campaigned to preserve their EU funding afterwards: for example, Cornwall.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/brexit-cornwall-issues-plea-for-funding-protection-after-county-overwhelmingly-votes-in-favour-of-a7101311.html "Cornwall issues plea to keep EU funding after voting for Brexit"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181009071311/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/brexit-cornwall-issues-plea-for-funding-protection-after-county-overwhelmingly-votes-in-favour-of-a7101311.html |date=9 October 2018 }}, ''Independent'', 24 June 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United States]], the phrases "turkeys voting for [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving]]" (that being the holiday when turkey is more commonly served) and "chickens voting for [[Colonel Sanders]]" are often used. In [[Canada]], the story of [[Mouseland]] has mice voting for cats.

A similar [[German language|German]] idiom is "Only the most stupid calves would vote for their butchers" ("Nur die dümmsten Kälber wählen ihre Metzger selber"). [[Bertold Brecht]] alluded to it in his ''Kälbermarsch'' ("March of the calves", 1933), a parody of the Nazi anthem "[[The Horst Wessel Song|Horst Wessel Song]]", which was included in his play ''[[Schweik in the Second World War]]'' (1943). A similar photomontage of [[John Heartfield]] shows Hitler as a butcher with a chicken and the caption "Don't panic! He's a vegetarian."&lt;ref&gt;Max Nyffeler: ''[http://www.nmz.de/artikel/kaelbermarsch Kälbermarsch] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160923085010/http://www.nmz.de/artikel/kaelbermarsch |date=23 September 2016 }}.''

'''VJing''' (pronounced: ''VEE-JAY-ing'') is a broad designation for realtime visual performance. Characteristics of VJing are the creation or manipulation of imagery in realtime through technological mediation and for an audience, in synchronization to music.&lt;ref&gt;"VJ: an artist who creates and mixes video live and in synchronization to music". - Eskandar, p.1.&lt;/ref&gt; VJing often takes place at events such as [[concerts]], [[nightclubs]], [[music festivals]] and sometimes in combination with other performative arts. This results in a live [[multimedia]] performance that can include music, actors and dancers. The term VJing became popular in its association with [[VJ (media personality)|MTV's Video Jockey]] but its origins date back to the New York club scene of the 70s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

One of the key elements in the practice of VJing is the realtime mix of content from a "library of media", on storage media such as VHS tapes or DVDs, video and still image files on computer hard drives, live camera input, or from computer generated visuals.&lt;ref name=Davis2006&gt;{{Citation

==History==

===Antecedents===

Historically, VJing gets its references from art forms that deal with the [[Synesthesia in art|synesthetic experience]] of vision and sound. These historical references are shared with other live audiovisual art forms, such as Live Cinema, to include the camera obscura, the panorama and diorama, the [[magic lantern]], [[color organ]], and [[liquid light shows]].

[[File:Sarabet color organ with Mary Hallock Greenewalt.gif|150px|thumb|left|Mary Hallock-Greenewalt and her electric light "color organ"]]
{{Main|Color organ}}
The color organ is a mechanism to make colors correspond to sound through mechanical and electromechanic means. Bainbridge Bishop, who contributed to the development of the color organ, was "dominated with the idea of painting music". In a book from 1893 that documents his work, Bishop states: "I procured an organ, and experimented by building an attachment to the keys, which would play with different colored lights to correspond with the music of the instrument."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Between 1919 and 1927, [[Mary Hallock-Greenewalt]], a piano soloist, created a new technological art form called ''[[Nourathar]]'', which means "essence of light" in Arabic. Her light music consisted of environmental color fields that produced a scale of light intensities and color. "In place of a keyboard, the [[Sarabet]] had a console with graduated sliders and other controls, more like a modern mixing board. Lights could be adjusted directly via the sliders, through the use of a pedal, and with toggle switches that worked like individual keys."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

{{Main|Liquid light shows}}
In clubs and private events in the 1960s "people used liquid-slides, disco balls and light projections on smoke to give the audience new sensations. Some of these experiments were linked to the music, but most of the time they functioned as decorations."&lt;ref&gt;Dekker (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;  These came to be known as ''liquid light shows''.
From 1965 to 1966 in San Francisco, the visual shows by artist collectives such as [[The Joshua Light Show]] and the [[Brotherhood of Light]] accompanied [[The Grateful Dead]] concerts, which were inspired by the [[Beat generation]]—in particular the [[Merry Pranksters]]—and fueled by the "expansion of consciousness" from the [[Acid Tests]].

The [[Exploding Plastic Inevitable]], between 1966 and 1967, organized by [[Andy Warhol]] contributed to the fusion of music and visuals in a party context. "The Exploding Party project examined the history of the party as an experimental artistic format, focusing in particular on music visualization - also in live contexts" &lt;ref&gt;Lund (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

===1970s===

====Important events====

During the late 1970s video and music performance became more tightly integrated. At concerts, a few bands started to have regular film/video along with their music. Experimental film maker Tony Potts was considered an unofficial member of [[The Monochrome Set]] for his work on lighting design and film making for projections for live shows. [[Test Dept.|Test Department]] initially worked with "Bert" Turnball as their resident visual artist, creating slideshows and film for live performances.&lt;ref&gt;credited on ''Beating The Retreat'', [[Some Bizzare Records]], 1984&lt;/ref&gt; The organization, Ministry of Power included collaborations with performance groups, traditional choirs and various political activists.
[[Industrial music|Industrial bands]] would perform in art contexts, as well as in concert halls, and often with video projections. Groups like [[Cabaret Voltaire (band)|Cabaret Voltaire]] started to use low cost video editing equipment to create their own time-based collages for their sound works. In their words, "before [the use of video], you had to do collages on paper, but now you present them in rhythm—living time—in video."{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} The film collages made by and for groups such as the [[Test Dept]], [[Throbbing Gristle]] and San Francisco's [[Tuxedomoon]] became part of their live shows.

An example of mixing film with live performance is that of Public Image Ltd. at the Ritz Riot in 1981. This club, located on the East 9th St in New York, had a state of the art video projection system. It was used to show a combination of prerecorded and live video on the club's screen. PiL played behind this screen with lights rear projecting their shadows on to the screen. Expecting a more traditional rock show, the audience reacted by pelting the projection screen with beer bottles and eventually pulling down the screen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

====Technological developments====
An artist retreat in Owego New York called [[Experimental Television Center]], founded in 1971, made contributions to the development of many artists by gathering the experimental hardware created by video art pioneers: [[Nam June Paik]], [[Steve Rutt]] and [[Bill Etra]], and made the equipment available to artists in an inviting setting for free experimentation. Many of the outcomes debuted at the nightclub [[Hurrah (nightclub)|Hurrah]] which quickly became a new alternative for video artists who could not get their avant garde productions aired on regular broadcast outlets. Similarly, music video development was happening in other major cities around the world, providing an alternative to mainstream television.

[[File:Sandin Image Processor.jpg|thumb|Sandin Image Processor, exhibited at School of the Art Institute of Chicago (SAIC)]]  A notable image processor is the [[Sandin Image Processor]] (1971), primarily as it describes what is now commonly referred to as [[open source]].

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The Dan Sandin Image Processor, or "IP," is an analog video processor with video signals sent through processing modules that route to an output color encoder. The IP's most unique attribute is its non-commercial philosophy, emphasizing a public access to processing methods and the machines that assist in generating the images. The IP was Sandin's electronic expression for a culture that would "learn to use High-Tech machines for personal, aesthetic, religious, intuitive, comprehensive, and exploratory growth." This educational goal was supplemented with a "distribution religion" that enabled video artists, and not-for-profit groups, to "roll-your-own" video synthesizer for only the cost of parts and the sweat and labor it took to build it. It was the "[[Heathkit]]" of video art tools, with a full building plan spelled out, including electronic schematics and mechanical assembly information. Tips on soldering, procuring electronic parts and Printed Circuit boards, were also included in the documentation, increasing the chances of successfully building a working version of the video synthesizer.

===1980s===

====Important events====
In May 1980, multi media artist / filmmaker Merrill Aldighieri was invited to screen a film at the nightclub Hurrah. At this time, music video clips did not exist in large quantity and the video installation was used to present an occasional film. To bring the role of visuals to an equal level with the DJ's music, Merrill made a large body of ambient visuals that could be combined in real time to interpret the music. Working alongside the DJ, this collection of raw visuals was mixed in real time to create a non-stop visual interpretation of the music. Merrill became the world's first full-time VJ. MTV founders came to this club and Merrill introduced them to the term and the role of "VJ",inspiring them to have VJ hosts on their channel the following year. Merrill collaborated with many musicians at the club, notably with electronic musician Richard Bone to make the first ambient music video album titled "Emerging Video". Thanks to a grant from the Experimental Television Center, her blend of video and 16&amp;nbsp;mm film bore the influential mark of the unique Rutt Etra and Paik synthesizers. This film was offered on VHS through "High Times Magazine" and was featured in the club programming. Her next foray into the home video audience was in collaboration with the newly formed arm of Sony, Sony HOME VIDEO, where she introduced the concept of "breaking music on video" with her series DANSPAK. With a few exceptions like the Jim Carrol Band with Lou Reed and Man Parrish, this series featured unknown bands, many of them unsigned.

The rise of electronic music (especially in house and techno genres) and DJ club culture provided more opportunities for artists to create live visuals at events. The popularity of [[MTV]] lead to greater and better production of music videos for both broadcast and [[VHS]], and many clubs began to show music videos as part of entertainment and atmosphere.

Joe Shannahan (owner of Metro in 1989-1990) was paying artists for video content on VHS. Part of the evening they would play MTV music videos and part of the evening they would run mixes from local artists Shanahan had commissioned.&lt;ref&gt;Interview with Brien Rullman aka VJ Tek of OVT. 10 May 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Medusa's (an all-ages bar in Chicago) incorporated visuals as part of their nightly art performances throughout the early to mid 80s (1983–85).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medusachicago.com/history.html Medusa Chicago&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  Also in Chicago during the mid-80s was Smart Bar, where Metro held "Video Metro" every Saturday night.&lt;ref&gt;[http://metrochicago.com/history/ Metro | Chicago&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Technological developments====

In the 1980s the development of relatively cheap transistor and [[integrated circuit]] technology allowed the development of digital video effects hardware at a price within reach of individual VJs and nightclub owners.

One of the first commercially distributed video synthesizers available in 1981 was the [[CEL Electronics Chromascope]] sold for use in the developing nightclub scene.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eyetrap.net/Chromascope_Video_Synthesizer.html Chromascope Video Synthesizer - eyetrap.net VJ network&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Fairlight Computer Video Instrument]] (CVI), first produced in 1983, was revolutionary in this area, allowing complex digital effects to be applied in real time to video sources. The CVI became popular amongst television and music video producers and features in a number of music videos from the period. The [[Amiga|Commodore Amiga]] introduced in 1985 made a breakthrough in accessibility for home computers and developed the first computer animation programs for 2D and 3D animation that could produce broadcast results on a desktop computer.

===1990s===

====Important events====

A number of recorded works begin to be published in the 1990s to further distribute the work of VJs, such as the Xmix compilations (beginning in 1993), [[Future Sound of London]]'s "Lifeforms"(VHS, 1994), [[Emergency Broadcast Network]]'s "Telecommunication Breakdown" (VHS, 1995),  [[Coldcut]] and [[Hexstatic]]'s "Timber" (VHS, 1997 and then later on CDRom including a copy of VJamm VJ software), the "Mego Videos" compilation of works from 1996-1998 (VHS/PAL, 1999) and [[Addictive TV]]'s 1998 television series "Transambient" for the UK's [[Channel 4]] (and DVD release).

In the United States, the emergence of the [[rave]] scene is perhaps to be credited for the shift of the VJ scene from nightclubs into underground parties. From around 1991 until 1994, Mark Zero would do film loops at Chicago raves and house parties.&lt;ref&gt;Interview with Brien Rullman of OVT.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the earliest large-scale&lt;ref&gt;Interview with OVT.&lt;/ref&gt; Chicago raves was "Massive New Years Eve Revolution" in 1993, produced by Milwaukee's Drop Bass Network. It was a notable event as it featured the [[Optique Vid Tek (OVT)]] VJs on the bill. This event was followed by Psychosis, held on 3 April 1993, and headlined by [[Psychic TV]], with visuals by OVT Visuals. In San Francisco [[Dimension 7]] were a VJ collective working the early West Coast rave scene beginning in 1993. Between 1996 and 1998, Dimension 7 took projectors and lasers to the [[Burningman]] festival, creating immersive video installations on the Black Rock desert.

In the UK groups such as [[The Light Surgeons]]  and Eikon were transforming clubs and rave events by combining the old techniques of liquid lightshows with layers of slide, film and video projections. In Bristol, Children of Technology emerged, pioneering interactive immersive environments stemming from co-founder Mike Godfrey's architectural thesis whilst at university during the 1980s. Children of Technology integrated their homegrown CGI animation and video texture library with output from the interactive Virtual Light Machine (VLM), the brainchild of Jeff Minter and Dave Japp, with output onto over 500 sq m of layered screens using high power video and laser projection within a dedicated lightshow. Their "Ambient Theatre Lightshow" first emerged at Glastonbury 93 and they also provided VJ visuals for the Shamen, who had just released their no 1. hit "Ebeneezer Good" at the festival. Invited musicians jammed in the Ambient Theatre Lightshow, using the VLM, within a prototype immersive environment. Children of Technology took interactive video concepts into a wide range of projects including show production for "Obsession" raves between 1993 and 1995, theatre, clubs, advertising, major stage shows and TV events. This included pioneering projects with 3D video / sound recording and performance, and major architectural projects in the late 1990s, where many media technology ideas were now taking hold. Another collective, "[[Hex (VJ group)|Hex]]" were working across a wide range of media - from computer games to art exhibitions - the group pioneered many new media hybrids, including live audiovisual jamming, computer-generated audio performances, and interactive collaborative instruments. This was the start of a trend which continues today with many VJs working beyond the club and dance party scene in areas such as installation art.

The Japanese book "VJ2000" (Daizaburo Harada, 1999) marked one of the earliest publications dedicated to discussing the practices of VJs.

====Technological developments====

The combination of the emerging rave scene, along with slightly more affordable video technology for home-entertainment systems, brought consumer products to become more widely used in artistic production. However, costs for these new types of video equipment were still high enough to be prohibitive for many artists.

There are three main factors that lead to the proliferation of the VJ scene in the 2000s:

# affordable and faster laptops;
# drop in prices of video projectors (especially after the [[dot-com bubble|dot-com bust]] where companies were loading off their goods on craigslist)&lt;ref&gt;Interview with [[Grant Davis]] aka VJ Culture specifically about the San Francisco scene.&lt;/ref&gt;
# the emergence of strong rave scenes and the growth of club culture internationally

As a result of these, the VJ scene saw an explosion of new artists and styles. These conditions also facilitated a sudden emergence of a less visible (but nonetheless strong) movement of artists who were creating algorithmic, generative visuals.

[[File:Videonics mx pro.jpg|thumb|left|The Videonics MX-1 video mixer]]

This decade saw video technology shift from being strictly for professional film and television studios to being accessible for the [[prosumer]] market (e.g. the wedding industry, church presentations, low-budget films, and community television productions).  These mixers were quickly adopted by VJs as the core component of their performance setups. This is similar to the release of the [[Technics 1200]] turntables, which were marketed towards homeowners desiring a more advanced home entertainment system, but were then appropriated by musicians and music enthusiasts for experimentation. Initially, [[video mixers]] were used to mix pre-prepared video material from [[VHS]]players and live camera sources, and later to add the new computer software outputs into their mix. The 90s saw the development of a number of digital [[video mixers]] such as Panasonic's WJ-MX50, WJ-MX12, and the [[Videonics MX-1]].

Early desktop editing systems such as the NewTek [[Video Toaster]] for the Amiga computer were quickly put to use by VJs seeking to create visuals for the emerging [[rave]] scene, whilst software developers began to develop systems specifically designed for live visuals such as O'Wonder's "Bitbopper".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.owonder.com/about/history.php ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080905163334/http://www.owonder.com/about/history.php |date=September 5, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first known software for VJs was [[Vujak]] - created in 1992 and written for the [[Macintosh|Mac]] by artist [[Brian Kane]] for use by the video art group he was part of - [[Emergency Broadcast Network]], though it was not used in live performances.  EBN used the EBN VideoSampler v2.3, developed by Mark Marinello and Greg Deocampo. 
In the UK, Bristol's Children of Technology developed a dedicated immersive video lightshow using the Virtual Light Machine (VLM) called AVLS or Audio-Visual-Live-System during 1992 and 1993. The VLM was a custom built PC by video engineer Dave Japp using super-rare transputer chips and modified motherboards, programmed by Jeff Minter (Llamasoft &amp; Virtual Light Co.). The VLM developed after Jeff's earlier Llamasoft Light Synthesiser programme. With VLM, DI's from live musicians or DJ's activated Jeff's algorithmic real-time video patterns, and this was real-time mixed using pansonic video mixers with CGI animation/VHS custom texture library and live camera video feedback. Children of Technology developed their own "Video Light" system, using hi-power and low-power video projection to generate real-time 3D beam effects, simultaneous with enormous surface and mapped projection. The VLM was used by the Shamen, The Orb, Primal Scream, Obsession, Peter Gabriel, Prince and many others between 1993 and 1996. A software version of the VLM was integrated into Atari's Jaguar console, in response to growing VJ interest. In the mid-90s, Audio reactive pure synthesis (as opposed to clip-based) software such as [[Cthugha (software)|Cthugha]] and Bomb were influential.  By the late 90s there were several PC based VJing software available, including generative visuals programs such as [[MooNSTER]], [[Aestesis]], and [[Advanced Visualization Studio]], as well as video clip players such as FLxER, and VJamm.

Programming environments such as [[Max/MSP]], [[Adobe Director|Macromedia Director]] and later [[Quartz Composer]] started to become used by themselves and also to create VJing programs like VDMX or [http://www.telematique.de/en/telematique-tools-pixmix-en.html pixmix]. These new software products and the dramatic increases in computer processing power over the decade meant that VJs were now regularly taking computers to gigs.

===2000s===

====Important events====

[[File:VJs at motion notion festival 2009.jpg|thumb|right|Two VJs collaborating on a mix at an outdoor electronic music festival.]]

The new century has brought new dynamics to the practice of visual performance. To be a VJ previously had largely meant a process of self-invention in isolation from others: the term was not widely known. Then through the rise of internet adoption, having access to other practitioners very became the norm, and virtual communities quickly formed. The sense of collective then translated from the virtual world onto physical spaces. This becomes apparent through the numerous festivals that emerge all over Europe with strong focus on VJing.

The [[VideA]] festival in Barcelona ran from 2000 - 2005.,&lt;ref&gt;"VideA was the first festival in Spain and perhaps to Europe to dedicate itself to the VJ's art." - {{Citation

Also the [[Cimatics]] festival in Brussels should be credited as a pioneering event, with a first festival edition in 2002 completely dedicated to VJing. In 2003, the Finnish media arts festival [[PixelAche]] was dedicated to the topic of VJing, while in 2003, Berlin's [[Chaos Computer Club]] started a collaboration with AVIT organisers that featured VJ Camps and [[Chaos Communication Congress|Congress]] strands. [[LPM - Live Performers Meeting]] was born in Rome in 2004 with the aim to answer to the need for creating a space-temporal referential field where to meet, know each other and share VJing related experiences. LPM has become an international meeting dedicated to artists, professionals and passionates of VJing, visual and live video performance. Also around this time (in 2005 and 2007) UK artists [[Addictive TV]] teamed up with the British Film Institute to produce [[Optronica]], a crossover event showcasing audiovisual performances at the [[London IMAX]] cinema and [[BFI Southbank]].

Two festivals entirely dedicated to VJing, [[Mapping Festival]] in Geneva and [[Vision'R]] in Paris, held their first edition in 2005.  As these festivals emerged that prominently featured VJs as headline acts (or the entire focus of the festival), the rave festival scene also began to regularly include VJs in their main stage lineups with varying degrees of prominence.

=====VJ events beyond Europe=====

The [[MUTEK]] festival (2000–present) in Montréal regularly featured VJs alongside experimental sound art performances, and later the [[Elektra Festival]] (2008–present) also emerged in Montréal and featured many VJ performances. In Perth, Australia, the [[Byte Me!]] festival (2007) showed the work of many VJs from the Pacific Rim area alongside new media theorists and design practitioners.

With lesser funding{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}, the US scene has been host to more workshops and salons than festivals. Between 2000-2006, [[Grant Davis]] (VJ Culture) and [[Jon Schwark]] of Dimension 7 produced "Video Salon", a regular monthly gathering significant in helping establish and educate a strong VJ community in San Francisco, and attended by VJs across California and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Eskandar, pp. 174–175&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, they produced an annual "Video RIOT!" (2003–2005) as a political statement following the R.A.V.E. Act ([[Reducing Americans' Vulnerability to Ecstasy Act]]) of 2003; a display of dissatisfaction by the re-election of George W. Bush in 2004; and in defiance of a San Francisco city ordinance limiting public gatherings in 2005.

Several VJ battles and competitions began to emerge during this time period, such as Video Salon's "[[SIGGRAPH]] VJ Battle" in San Diego (2003), Videocake's "AV Deathmatch" series in Toronto (2006) and the "VJ Contests" at the Mapping Festival in Geneva (2009). These worked much like a traditional DJ battle where VJs would be given a set amount of time to show off their best mixes and were judged according to several criteria by a panel of judges.

=====Publications=====

Databases of visual content and promotional documentation became available on DVD formats and online through personal websites and through large databases, such as the "[[Prelinger Archives]]" on [[Archive.org]]. Many VJs began releasing digital video loop sets on various websites under [[Public Domain]] or [[Creative Commons]] licensing for other VJs to use in their mixes, such as Tom Bassford's "Design of Signage" collection (2006), Analog Recycling's "79 VJ Loops" (2006), VJzoo's "Vintage Fairlight Clips" (2007) and Mo Selle's "57 V.2" (2007).

Promotional and content based DVDs began to emerge, such as the works from the UK's [[ITV1]] television series [[Mixmasters]] (2000–2005) produced by [[Addictive TV]], [[Lightrhythm Visuals]] (2003), [[Visomat Inc.]] (2002), and [[Pixdisc]], all of which focused on the visual creators, VJ styles and techniques. These were then later followed by [[NOTV]], [[Atmospherix]], and other labels. Mia Makela curated a DVD collection for Mediateca of Caixa Forum called "LIVE CINEMA" in 2007, focusing on the emerging sister practice of "live cinema". Individual VJs and collectives also published DVDs and CD-ROMs of their work, including Eclectic Method's bootleg video mix (2002) and Eclectic Method's "We're Not VJs" (2005), as well as eyewash's "DVD2" (2004) and their "DVD3" (2008).

Books reflecting on the history, technical aspects, and theoretical issues began to appear, such as "The VJ Book: Inspirations and Practical Advice for Live Visuals Performance" (Paul Spinrad, 2005), "VJ: Audio-Visual Art and VJ Culture" (Michael Faulkner and [[D-Fuse AV|D-Fuse]], 2006), "vE-jA: Art + Technology of Live Audio-Video" (Xárene Eskandar [ed], 2006), and "VJ: Live Cinema Unraveled" (Tim Jaeger, 2006). The subject of VJ-DJ collaboration also started to become a subject of interest for those studying in the field of academic [[human–computer interaction]] (HCI).

====Technological developments====
The availability and affordability of new consumer-level technology allowed many more people to get involved into VJing. The dramatic increase in computer processing power that became available facilitated more compact, yet often more complex setups, sometimes allowing VJs to bypass using a video mixer, using powerful computers running VJ software to control their mixing instead. However, many VJs continue to use video mixers with multiple sources, which allows flexibility for a wide range of input devices and a level of security against computer crashes or slowdowns in video playback due to overloading the CPU of computers due to the demanding nature of realtime video processing.

[[File:VJing with PureData at Zoo Geneva.jpg|thumb|left|VJing with PureData.]]

Today's VJs have a wide choice of off the shelf hardware products, covering every aspect of visuals performance, including video sample playback (Korg Kaptivator), real-time video effects (Korg Entrancer) and 3D visual generation.

The widespread use of DVDs gave initiative for scratchable DVD players.

Many new models of MIDI controllers became available during the 2000s, which allow VJs to use controllers based on physical knobs, dials, and sliders, rather than interact primarily with the mouse/keyboard computer interface.

There are also many VJs working with experimental approaches to working with live video. Open source graphical programming environments (such as [[Pure Data]]) are often used to create custom software interfaces for performances, or to connect experimental devices to their computer for processing live data (for example, the [[IBVA]] [[EEG]]-reading brainwave unit, the [[Arduino]] microprocessor, or [[circuit bending]] children's toys).

[[File:Guerilla VJ bike.jpg|thumb|right|Guerilla VJ bike - setup for DIY outdoor projection.]]

The second half of this decade also saw a dramatic increase in display configurations being deployed, including widescreen canvases, multiple projections and [[video mapping|video mapped]] onto the architectural form. This shift has been underlined by the transition from broadcast based technology - fixed until this decade firmly in the 4x3 aspect ratio specifications [[NTSC]] and [[PAL]] - to computer industry technology, where the varied needs of office presentation, immersive gaming and corporate video presentation have led to diversity and abundance in methods of output. Compared to the ~640x480i fixed format of NTSC/PAL, a contemporary laptop using DVI can output a great variety of resolutions up to ~2500px wide, and in conjunction with the Matrox TripleHead2Go can feed three different displays with an image coordinated across them all.

==Common technical setups==

A significant aspect of VJing is the use of technology, be it the re-appropriation of existing technologies meant for other fields, or the creation of new and specific ones for the purpose of live performance. The advent of video is a defining moment for the formation of the VJ (video jockey).

Often using a [[video mixer]], VJs blend and superimpose various video sources into a live motion composition.  In recent years, electronic musical instrument makers have begun to make specialty equipment for VJing.

[[File:VDMX interface.jpg|thumb|Customized VDMX Interface]]
[[File:LED screen behind Tsach Zimroni in Tel Aviv Israel.jpg|thumb|LED wall display surrounding DJ on stage]]

VJing developed initially by performers using video hardware such as videocameras, video decks and monitors to transmit improvised performances with live input from cameras and even broadcast TV mixed with pre-recorded elements. This tradition lives on with many VJs using a wide range of hardware and software available commercially or custom made for and by the VJs.

VJ hardware can be split into categories -
*'''Source''' hardware generates a video picture which can be manipulated by the VJ, e.g. [[video camera]]s and [[Video Synthesizer]]s.
*'''Playback''' hardware plays back an existing video stream from disk or tape based storage mediums, e.g. [[VHS]] tape players and [[DVD players]].
*'''Mixing''' hardware allows the combining of multiple streams of video e.g. a [[Video Mixer]] or a computer utilizing VJ software.
*'''Effects''' hardware allows the adding of special effects to the video stream, e.g. Colour Correction units
*'''Output''' hardware is for displaying the video signal, e.g. [[Video projector]], [[LED display]], or [[Plasma Screen]].

There are many types of software a VJ may use in their work,  traditional [[Non linear editing|NLE]] production tools such as [[Adobe Premiere]], [[After Effects]], and Apple's [[Final Cut Pro]] are used to create content for VJ shows.  Specialist performance software is used by VJs to play back and manipulate video in realtime.

VJ performance software is highly diverse, and include software which allows a computer to replace the role of an analog video mixer and output video across extended canvasses composed of multiple screens or projectors. Small companies producing dedicated VJ software such as [[Modul8]] and [[Magic Music Visuals|Magic]] give VJs a sophisticated interface for realtime processing of multiple layers of video clips combined with live camera inputs, giving VJs a complete off the shelf solution so they can simply load in the content and perform. Some popular titles which emerged during the 2000s include Resolume, NuVJ.

Some VJs prefer to develop software themselves specifically to suit their own performance style. Graphical programming environments such as [[max/msp|Max/MSP/Jitter]], [[Isadora (software)|Isadora]], and [[Pure Data]] have developed to facilitate rapid development of such custom software without needing years of coding experience.

===Sample workflows===

There are many types of configurations of hardware and software that a VJ may use to perform.

==Research and reflective thinking==
Several research projects have been dedicated to the documentation and study of VJing from the reflective and theoretical point of view. In the Netherlands Media Art Institute, Montevideo / Time Based Arts, Annet Dekker organized a research on the subject called ''VJ Cultuur – a state of flux''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
  | title = VJCultuur, a state of flux
  | date = 2004–2005
  | url = http://www.vjcultuur.nl
  | accessdate =12 May 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dekker wrote widely on the history of VJing and its contextualization within the club culture. In the same year, 2005, ''VJ Theory'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
  | title = VJ Theory
  | year = 2005
  | url = http://www.vjtheory.net
  | accessdate =12 May 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; began publishing texts written by practitioners and academics, and organizing collective discussions online and offline around subjects related to VJing and audiovisual performative practices.
Between 2005 and 2006 several books were published with interviews, showcasing works and related artists, providing an overview of the current practice.&lt;ref&gt;These include ''The VJ Book: Inspirations and practical Advice for Live Visuals Performance'' by Paul Spinrad, ''VJ: Audio-Visual Art and VJ Culture'' edited by D-Fuse, vE-jA: Art + Technology of Live Audio-Video edited by Xárene Eskandar. For more details please check the bibliography.&lt;/ref&gt;

Round tables, talks, presentations and discussions are part of festivals and conferences related to new media art, such as [[Inter-Society for the Electronic Arts|ISEA]] and [[Ars Electronica]] for example, as well as specifically related to VJing, as is the case of the Mapping Festival. Exchange of ideas through dialogue contributed to the shift of the discussion from issues related to the practicalities of production to more complex ideas and to the process and the concept. Subjects related to VJing are, but not exclusively: identity and persona (individual and collective), the moment as art, audience participation, authorship, networks, collaboration and narrative.
Through collaborative projects, visual live performance shift to a field of interdisciplinary practices.

Periodical publications, online and printed, launched special issues on VJing. This is the case of AMinima printed magazine, with a special issue on Live Cinema &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

'''World Rock'n'Roll Confederation''' ('''WRRC''') was  registered in 1984, although its history traces to 1974. It is an [[umbrella organization]] for national professional and amateur [[rock and roll (dance)|Rock and Roll]] [[dancesport]] federations. Its statute that it "aims at promoting the physical training of its members by means of sporting activities in the form of Rock'n'Roll dance tournaments, including the acrobatic variations ([[acrobatic rock'n'roll]]) as well as Rock'n'Roll and [[boogie woogie (dance)|Boogie Woogie]], [[Lindy Hop]], [[Formation dance|Formation]] and alternative styles in line with the rules and sporting presentations". The registered office is in [[Ljubljana]], [[Slovenia]].

The WRRC are members of the [[IDSF]] from 19 June 2011 known as WDSF, [[IDSF|World DanceSport Federation]], the [[GAISF]] now [[SportAccord]], the [[IOC]], and a member of the sports forum of the [[European Union]].

== History ==

In 1974, [[Italy]], [[France]], [[Germany]] and [[Switzerland]] founded the [[European Rock'n'Roll Association]] (ERRA). It was later joined by [[Austria]], [[Netherlands]], [[Denmark]], and [[Sweden]]. When [[Canada]] joined the association it was renamed into the World Rock'n'Roll Association  (WRRA). In 1984, the WRRC was created by merging the WRRA and  Fédération Mondial de Dance de Jazz (FMDJ, World Federation of Jazz Dance). In 1995, it was granted the provisional recognition of the [[IOC]].

As of 2011, the following nations are members of the WRRC: [[France]], [[Netherlands]], [[Switzerland]], [[Austria]], [[Germany]], [[Belgium]], [[Slovenia]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Canada]], [[Italy]], [[Sweden]], [[Finland]], [[Lebanon]], [[Liechtenstein]], [[Luxembourg]], [[Hungary]], [[Denmark]], [[Czech Republic]], [[Slovakia]], [[Poland]], [[Russia]], [[Croatia]], [[Latvia]], [[Norway]], [[Spain]], [[San Marino]], [[Ukraine]], [[Australia]], [[Greece]], [[United States]], [[Mexico]], [[Singapore]], [[Great Britain]], [[Bosnia-Herzegovina]], [[Estonia]].&lt;ref&gt;According to the Website&lt;/ref&gt;

== Organization ==

The World Rock'n'Roll Confederation organization consists of the Presidium consisting of the President, Vice President, Treasurer, Sports Director and the General Secretary. The Presidium is elected by the General Meeting held in March every year. To the aid of the Presidium there are different commissions or commissioners who act as the Presidium's expert advisers concerning rules and judges training among other things. As of current there are commissioners for [[Lindy Hop]], [[Boogie-woogie (dance)|Boogie Woogie]], [[Formation dance|Formations]] and a Medical Commissioner.&lt;ref&gt;Oversees the medical procedures and evaluates the physical status of the athletes.&lt;/ref&gt;

The WRRC General Meeting gives the Presidium its instructions to work with and decides in which direction the federation should go. These decisions are made by majority vote. However the Presidium has a certain amount of freedom to act on its own concerning for example minor changes of rules. The Official language of the WRRC is English.

== Competitions ==

The WRRC organizes several different competitions each year. Together with national and local organizations the WRRC cunducts World Cup events, World and European Championships. The 

Competition classes:

* [[Rock and Roll (dance)]] - Main Class, B-Class, Junior and Youth
* [[Lindy Hop]] - Main Class and Juniors
* [[Boogie-woogie (dance)|Boogie Woogie]] - Main Class and Juniors
* [[Bugg]] - Main Class and Juniors
* [[Double bugg]] - Main Class and Juniors
* Formation - Main Class Juniors and Ladies

== Future ==

The future of the World Rock'n'Roll Confederation seems bright since dancesport worldwide gains more and more interest due to the increased amount of dance shown in different media. The organization hopes that Acrobatic Rock'n'Roll will become an Olympic Sport and works hard to make this happen in the coming years.

== Anti-doping ==

As well as other [[sport]] [[federation]]s the WRRC continuously works with Anti-Doping and follows the recommendations and rules of the [[World Anti-Doping Agency]] and since the WRRC are members of the IDSF their rules and codes apply also for the WRRC. Today all cases of suspected usage of illegal substances are handled by the IDSF Disciplinary Counsel. All participators of WRRC and IDSF competitions are required to sign a form of consent that you agree to the terms of the Anti-Doping code, if not signed or refusal to sign, you may not participate.
