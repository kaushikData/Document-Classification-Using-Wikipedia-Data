      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8798">'''Adam of Wodeham''', [[Franciscan|OFM]] (1298–1358) was a philosopher and theologian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Courtenay|first=William J.|title=Adam Wodeham: An Introduction to His Life and Writings|year=1978|publisher=Leiden|location=London|pages=160}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, Wodeham is best known for having been a secretary of [[William Ockham]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Sum of Logic|''Summa Logicae'' (c. 1323)]], [http://www.pvspade.com/Logic/docs/ockham.pdf Prefatory Letter, as translated by Paul Vincent Spade (1995)].&lt;/ref&gt; and for his interpretations of [[John Duns Scotus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brower-Toland|first=Susan|title=Facts vs. Things: Adam Wodeham and the Later Medieval Debate About Objects of Judgment|journal=The Review of Metaphysics|date=Dec 2006|volume=60|issue=3|pages=598}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this associational fame, Wodeham was an influential thinker who made valuable philosophical contributions during his life.

== Early life and education ==
Wodeham was born near [[Southampton]], England in 1298.

Apart from his association with Scotus and Ockham, very little is known about Wodeham’s early upbringing and education. The information that is available seems to be based upon what scholars know from other sources about education in England at the beginning of the 14th century. Since contemporary scholars know that Wodeham was a part of the Franciscan intellectual tradition, several assumptions can be made about Wodeham’s education. To begin with, Wodeham most likely began his education in England by entering the Franciscan Order sometime between the ages of 14 and 18.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Courtenay|title=Adam Wodeham|pages=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; After having begun his education, Wodeham would have studied philosophy and theology in various stages for about 13 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Courtenay|title=Adam Wodeham|pages=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to William J. Courtenay, Wodeham met William Ockham sometime between 1320-1324.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Courtenay|title=Adam Wodeham|pages=161–163}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this period of his life, Wodeham was finishing his studies in philosophy. In light of the fact that much of Wodeham’s work supported Ockham’s thought, it seems that Wodeham’s views were greatly influenced by his interactions with Ockham.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Courtenay|first=William J.|title=Ockham and Ockhamism: Studies in the Dissemination and Impact of His Thought|year=2008|publisher=Leiden|location=Boston|pages=351}}&lt;/ref&gt; The works Wodeham produced in support of Ockham were partly responsible for Ockham’s prominence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wodeham|first=Adam de|title=Lectura Secunda in Librum Primum Sententiarum. Vol. I.|year=1990|publisher=Franciscan Institute Publications|location=New York|pages=5*|editor=Rega Wood}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following this portion of his life, Wodeham studied theology at Oxford between 1326 and 1329.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Courtenay|title=Adam Wodeham|pages=164}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Wodeham did not produce much original work during this portion of his life, he appears to have gained the confidence to develop his own views and to think outside of the current paradigm. At the pinnacle of his career, Wodeham’s willingness to be original resulted in many of his views being regarded as controversial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wodeham|title=Lectura Secunda|pages=5–6*}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Susan Brower-Toland gives one important example of this point. She argues that when Wodeham introduced the notion commonly referred to as "complexe significabile," or “something that can be signified [only] by a propositional expression,” he was introducing a new and important idea. According to Brower-Toland, Wodeham’s introduction of this term signified “a fairly radical departure from the standard medieval-Aristotelian substance-accident framework.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brower-Toland|title=Facts vs. Things|pages=599–600}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==

Between the years 1329 and 1332, Wodeham’s work became much more widespread and accessible as a result of lectures he gave at Norwich on Peter Lombard’s “Sentences.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gracia|first=Jorge J.E.|title=A Companion to Philosophy in the Middle Ages|year=2006|publisher=Blackwell|location=Malden, MA|pages=77|author2=Timothy B. Noone}}&lt;/ref&gt; The topics at the Norwich lectures were quite diverse. Themes included everything from biblical interpretation to physics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gracia|title=A Companion to Philosophy in the Middle Ages|pages=77–80}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to note that Wodeham gave lectures at Norwich, London, and Oxford. At this point in time, the order and relationship of these lectures appears to be a matter of controversy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wodeham|title=Lectura Secunda|pages=30–38*}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following these lectures at Norwich, sometime immediately after 1330, Wodeham’s career advanced and he began to lecture at Oxford.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Courtenay|title=Adam Wodeham|pages=165}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this portion of his life, Wodeham lectured on theological topics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Courtenay|title=Adam Wodeham|pages=180}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed that Wodeham elaborated and built upon his Norwich lectures during this time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Cambridge History of Medieval Philosophy|year=2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|pages=840|editor=Robert Pasnau}}&lt;/ref&gt; These lectures only recently became available in Latin in 1990. Currently, these lectures are the primary work available of Wodeham’s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gracia|title=A Companion to Philosophy in the Middle Ages|pages=77}}&lt;/ref&gt; This stage of Wodeham’s life at Oxford reached its completion just prior to 1340.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Courtenay|title=Adam Wodeham|pages=180}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was during Wodeham’s time at Oxford that he became most intellectually influential. Apart from the obvious interactions and dialogues that Wodeham had with his colleagues at Oxford, he also became well known in Paris during his Oxford years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Courtenay|title=Adam Wodeham|pages=123}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Courtenay points out in his biography on Wodeham, “[A]lmost all Parisian authors between 1342 and 1345 cite Wodeham.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Courtenay|title=Adam Wodeham|pages=123}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wodeham's work continued to be influential into the beginning of the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gracia|title=A Companion to Philosophy in the Middle Ages|pages=84}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Death ==

Sometime around 1340 Wodeham left both Oxford and England. During this time away from England, Wodeham traveled for an undocumented period of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Courtenay|title=Adam Wodeham|pages=181}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually Wodeham came back to England and died, possibly from the plague, at Babwell Convent in 1358.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wodeham|title=Lectura Secunda|pages=5*}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not much is known about Wodeham’s life after he left Oxford.

'''Alfred North Whitehead''' {{postnominals|country=GBR|OM|FRS|FBA}} (15 February 1861&amp;nbsp;– 30 December 1947) was an [[English people|English]] mathematician and philosopher.  He is best known as the defining figure of the philosophical school known as [[process philosophy]],&lt;ref&gt;[[David Ray Griffin]], ''Reenchantment Without Supernaturalism: A Process Philosophy of Religion'' (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 2001), vii.&lt;/ref&gt; which today has found application to a wide variety of disciplines, including ecology, theology, education, physics, biology, economics, and psychology, among other areas.

In his early career Whitehead wrote primarily on mathematics, logic, and physics. His most notable work in these fields is the three-volume ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'' (1910–13), which he wrote with former student [[Bertrand Russell]]. ''Principia Mathematica'' is considered one of the twentieth century's most important works in mathematical logic, and placed 23rd in a list of the top 100 English-language nonfiction books of the twentieth century by [[Modern Library]].&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;"The Modern Library's Top 100 Nonfiction Books of the Century", last modified April 30, 1999, ''[[The New York Times]]'', accessed November 21, 2013, https://www.nytimes.com/library/books/042999best-nonfiction-list.html.&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in the late 1910s and early 1920s, Whitehead gradually turned his attention from mathematics to [[philosophy of science]], and finally to [[metaphysics]]. He developed a comprehensive metaphysical system which radically departed from most of [[western philosophy]]. Whitehead argued that reality consists of [[Event (philosophy)|processes]] rather than material objects, and that processes are best defined by their relations with other processes, thus rejecting the theory that reality is fundamentally constructed by bits of matter that exist independently of one another.&lt;ref name="RobertMesle"&gt;[[C. Robert Mesle]], ''Process-Relational Philosophy: An Introduction to Alfred North Whitehead'' (West Conshohocken: Templeton Foundation Press, 2009), 9.&lt;/ref&gt;  Today Whitehead's philosophical works – particularly ''[[Process and Reality]]'' – are regarded as the foundational texts of process philosophy.

Whitehead's process philosophy argues that "there is urgency in coming to see the world as a web of interrelated processes of which we are integral parts, so that all of our choices and actions have consequences for the world around us."&lt;ref name="RobertMesle" /&gt; For this reason, one of the most promising applications of Whitehead's thought in recent years has been in the area of [[ecological civilization]] and [[environmental ethics]] pioneered by [[John B. Cobb|John B. Cobb, Jr.]]&lt;ref name="PhilipRose"&gt;Philip Rose, ''On Whitehead'' (Belmont: Wadsworth, 2002), preface.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Putting Philosophy to Work"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cobb, Jr. |first1=John B. |last2=Schwartz |first2=Wm. Andrew |title=Putting Philosophy to Work: Toward an Ecological Civilization |date=2018 |publisher=Process Century Press |isbn=978-1940447339 |url=https://www.amazon.com/Putting-Philosophy-Work-Ecological-Civilization/dp/194044733X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
===Childhood, education===
[[File:cmglee Cambridge Trinity College Whewells Court.jpg|thumb|left|Whewell's Court north range at [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity College]], [[Cambridge]].  Whitehead spent thirty years at Trinity, five as a student and twenty-five as a senior lecturer.]]
Alfred North Whitehead was born in [[Ramsgate]], [[Kent]], England, in 1861.&lt;ref name="VictorLowe_c"&gt;Victor Lowe, ''Alfred North Whitehead: The Man and his Work, Vol I'' (Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins Press, 1985), 2.&lt;/ref&gt;  His father, Alfred Whitehead, was a minister and schoolmaster of [[Chatham House Grammar School|Chatham House Academy]], a school for boys established by Thomas Whitehead, Alfred North's grandfather.&lt;ref name="VictorLowe"&gt;Victor Lowe, ''Alfred North Whitehead: The Man and his Work, Vol I'' (Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins Press, 1985), 13.&lt;/ref&gt;  Whitehead himself recalled both of them as being very successful schoolmasters, but that his grandfather was the more extraordinary man.&lt;ref name="VictorLowe" /&gt;  Whitehead's mother was Maria Sarah Whitehead, formerly Maria Sarah Buckmaster. Whitehead was apparently not particularly close with his mother, as he never mentioned her in any of his writings, and there is evidence that Whitehead's wife, Evelyn, had a low opinion of her.&lt;ref&gt;Victor Lowe, ''Alfred North Whitehead: The Man and his Work, Vol I'' (Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins Press, 1985), 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

Whitehead was educated at [[Sherborne School]], [[Dorset]], then considered one of the best [[Public school (United Kingdom)|public schools]] in the country.&lt;ref&gt;Victor Lowe, ''Alfred North Whitehead: The Man and his Work, Vol I'' (Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins Press, 1985), 44.&lt;/ref&gt; His childhood was described as over-protected,&lt;ref&gt;Victor Lowe, ''Alfred North Whitehead: The Man and his Work, Vol I'' (Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins Press, 1985), 32–33.&lt;/ref&gt; but when at school he excelled in sports and mathematics&lt;ref&gt;Victor Lowe, ''Alfred North Whitehead: The Man and his Work, Vol I'' (Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins Press, 1985), 54–60.&lt;/ref&gt; and was head [[Prefect#Academic|prefect]] of his class.&lt;ref name= "VictorLowe_a"&gt;Victor Lowe, ''Alfred North Whitehead: The Man and his Work, Vol I'' (Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins Press, 1985), 63.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1880, Whitehead began attending [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], and studied mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;Victor Lowe, ''Alfred North Whitehead: The Man and his Work, Vol I'' (Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins Press, 1985), 72.&lt;/ref&gt; His academic advisor was [[Edward John Routh]].&lt;ref name="mathgenealogy|id=101929"&gt;{{mathgenealogy|id=101929}}&lt;/ref&gt; He earned his BA from Trinity in 1884, and graduated as fourth [[Wrangler (University of Cambridge)|wrangler]].&lt;ref&gt;Victor Lowe, ''Alfred North Whitehead: The Man and his Work, Vol I'' (Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins Press, 1985), 103.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Career===
Elected a [[fellow]] of Trinity in 1884, Whitehead would teach and write on [[mathematics]] and [[physics]] at the college until 1910, spending the 1890s writing his ''Treatise on Universal Algebra'' (1898), and the 1900s collaborating with his former pupil, [[Bertrand Russell]], on the first edition of ''[[Principia Mathematica]]''.&lt;ref&gt;On Whitehead the mathematician and logician, see [[Ivor Grattan-Guinness]], ''The Search for Mathematical Roots 1870–1940: Logics, Set Theories, and the Foundations of Mathematics from Cantor through Russell to Gödel'' (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2000), and [[Willard Van Orman Quine|Quine]]'s chapter in [[Paul Arthur Schilpp|Paul Schilpp]], ''The Philosophy of Alfred North Whitehead'' (New York: Tudor Publishing Company, 1941), 125–163.&lt;/ref&gt; He was a [[Cambridge Apostle]].&lt;ref&gt;Victor Lowe, ''Alfred North Whitehead: The Man and his Work, Vol I'' (Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins Press, 1985), 112.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1890, Whitehead married Evelyn Wade, an Irish woman raised in France; they had a daughter, Jessie Whitehead, and two sons, [[Thomas North Whitehead]] and Eric Whitehead.&lt;ref name="VictorLowe_a" /&gt;  Eric Whitehead died in action at the age of 19, while serving in the [[Royal Flying Corps]] during World War I.&lt;ref&gt;Victor Lowe, ''Alfred North Whitehead: The Man and his Work, Vol II'' (Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins Press, 1990), 34.&lt;/ref&gt; Alfred's brother Henry became Bishop of Madras, and wrote a closely observed ethnographic account of the ''[[Village Gods of South-India]]'' (Calcutta: Association Press, 1921), which is still of value today.

[[File:Russell1907-2.jpg|thumb|right|[[Bertrand Russell]] in 1907.  Russell was a student of Whitehead's at Trinity College, and a longtime collaborator and friend.]]
In 1910, Whitehead resigned his senior lectureship in mathematics at Trinity and moved to London without first lining up another job.&lt;ref&gt;Victor Lowe, ''Alfred North Whitehead: The Man and his Work, Vol II'' (Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins Press, 1990), 2.&lt;/ref&gt; After being unemployed for a year, Whitehead accepted a position as lecturer in applied mathematics and mechanics at [[University College London]], but was passed over a year later for the Goldsmid Chair of Applied Mathematics and Mechanics, a position for which he had hoped to be seriously considered.&lt;ref&gt;Victor Lowe, ''Alfred North Whitehead: The Man and his Work, Vol II'' (Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins Press, 1990), 6-8.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1914 Whitehead accepted a position as professor of applied mathematics at the newly chartered [[Imperial College London]], where his old friend [[Andrew Forsyth]] had recently been appointed chief professor of mathematics.&lt;ref name="Victor Lowe 1990"&gt;Victor Lowe, ''Alfred North Whitehead: The Man and his Work, Vol II'' (Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins Press, 1990), 26-27.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1918 Whitehead's academic responsibilities began to seriously expand as he accepted a number of high administrative positions within the [[University of London]] system, of which Imperial College London was a member at the time. He was elected dean of the Faculty of Science at the University of London in late 1918 (a post he held for four years), a member of the University of London's Senate in 1919, and chairman of the Senate's Academic (leadership) Council in 1920, a post which he held until he departed for America in 1924.&lt;ref name="Victor Lowe 1990"/&gt; Whitehead was able to exert his newfound influence to successfully lobby for a new history of science department, help establish a Bachelor of Science degree (previously only Bachelor of Arts degrees had been offered), and make the school more accessible to less wealthy students.&lt;ref&gt;Victor Lowe, ''Alfred North Whitehead: The Man and his Work, Vol II'' (Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins Press, 1990), 72-74.&lt;/ref&gt;

Toward the end of his time in England, Whitehead turned his attention to [[philosophy]].  Though he had no advanced training in philosophy, his philosophical work soon became highly regarded.  After publishing ''The Concept of Nature'' in 1920, he served as president of the [[Aristotelian Society]] from 1922 to 1923.&lt;ref&gt;Victor Lowe, ''Alfred North Whitehead: The Man and his Work, Vol II'' (Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins Press, 1990), 127.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Move to the US, 1924===
In 1924, [[Henry Osborn Taylor]] invited the 63-year-old Whitehead to join the faculty at [[Harvard University]] as a professor of philosophy.&lt;ref name="VictorLowe_d"&gt;Victor Lowe, ''Alfred North Whitehead: The Man and his Work, Vol II'' (Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins Press, 1990), 132.&lt;/ref&gt;

During his time at Harvard, Whitehead produced his most important philosophical contributions. In 1925, he wrote ''Science and the Modern World'', which was immediately hailed as an alternative to the [[Cartesianism|Cartesian]] [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualism]] that plagued popular science.&lt;ref&gt;Victor Lowe, ''Alfred North Whitehead: The Man and his Work, Vol I'' (Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins Press, 1985), 3–4.&lt;/ref&gt; Lectures from 1927–28, were published in 1929 as a book named ''[[Process and Reality]]'', which has been compared (both in importance and difficulty) to [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]''.&lt;ref name="PhilipRose" /&gt;

The Whiteheads spent the rest of their lives in the United States. Alfred North Whitehead retired from Harvard in 1937 and remained in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]] until his death on 30 December 1947.&lt;ref&gt;Victor Lowe, ''Alfred North Whitehead: The Man and his Work, Vol II'' (Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins Press, 1990), 262.&lt;/ref&gt;

The two-volume biography of Whitehead by Victor Lowe&lt;ref&gt;Victor Lowe, ''Alfred North Whitehead: The Man and his Work, Vols I &amp; II'' (Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins Press, 1985 &amp; 1990).&lt;/ref&gt; is the most definitive presentation of the life of Whitehead. However, many details of Whitehead's life remain obscure because he left no ''[[Nachlass]]''; his family carried out his instructions that all of his papers be destroyed after his death.&lt;ref name="VictorLowe_b"&gt;Victor Lowe, ''Alfred North Whitehead: The Man and his Work, Vol I'' (Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins Press, 1985), 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Whitehead was known for his "almost fanatical belief in the right to privacy", and for writing very few personal letters of the kind that would help to gain insight on his life.&lt;ref name="VictorLowe_b" /&gt;  This led to Lowe himself remarking on the first page of Whitehead's biography, "No professional biographer in his right mind would touch him."&lt;ref name="VictorLowe_c" /&gt;

Led by Executive Editor Brian G. Henning and General Editor George R. Lucas, Jr., the [[Whitehead Research Project]] of the [[Center for Process Studies]] is currently working on a critical edition of Whitehead's published and unpublished works.&lt;ref name="CEW"&gt;"Critical Edition of Whitehead", last modified July 16, 2013, Whitehead Research Project, accessed November 21, 2013, http://whiteheadresearch.org/research/cew/press-release.shtml {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131209000755/http://whiteheadresearch.org/research/cew/press-release.shtml |date=9 December 2013 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; The first volume of the [https://edinburghuniversitypress.com/series-the-edinburgh-critical-edition-of-the-complete-works-of-alfred-north-whitehead.html ''Edinburgh Critical Edition of the Complete Works of Alfred North Whitehead''] was published in 2017 by Paul A. Bogaard and Jason Bell as ''The Harvard Lectures of Alfred North Whitehead, 1924-1925: The Philosophical Presuppositions of Science.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://edinburghuniversitypress.com/series-the-edinburgh-critical-edition-of-the-complete-works-of-alfred-north-whitehead.html|title=The Edinburgh Critical Edition of the Complete Works of Alfred North Whitehead|website=Edinburgh University Press Books|language=en|access-date=2018-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mathematics and logic==
In addition to numerous articles on mathematics, Whitehead wrote three major books on the subject: ''A Treatise on Universal Algebra'' (1898), ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'' (co-written with [[Bertrand Russell]] and published in three volumes between 1910 and 1913), and ''An Introduction to Mathematics'' (1911).  The former two books were aimed exclusively at professional [[mathematician]]s, while the latter book was intended for a larger audience, covering the [[history of mathematics]] and its [[Philosophy of mathematics|philosophical foundations]].&lt;ref name="religion-online"&gt;Christoph Wassermann, "The Relevance of An Introduction to Mathematics to Whitehead's Philosophy", ''Process Studies'' 17 (1988): 181.  Available online at {{cite web |url=http://www.religion-online.org/showarticle.asp?title=2753 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-11-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203051411/http://www.religion-online.org/showarticle.asp?title=2753 |archivedate=3 December 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Principia Mathematica'' in particular is regarded as one of the most important works in mathematical logic of the 20th century.

In addition to his legacy as a co-writer of ''Principia Mathematica'', Whitehead's theory of "extensive abstraction" is considered foundational for the branch of [[ontology]] and [[computer science]] known as "[[mereotopology]]", a theory describing [[spatial relation]]s among wholes, parts, parts of parts, and the [[Boundary (topology)|boundaries]] between parts.&lt;ref&gt;"Whitehead, Alfred North", last modified May 8, 2007, Gary L. Herstein, ''[[Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'', accessed November 21, 2013, http://www.iep.utm.edu/whitehed/.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''A Treatise on Universal Algebra''===
In ''A Treatise on Universal Algebra'' (1898) the term "[[universal algebra]]" had essentially the same meaning that it has today: the study of [[algebraic structure]]s themselves, rather than examples ("models") of algebraic structures.&lt;ref name="Gratzer"&gt;George Grätzer, ''Universal Algebra'' (Princeton: Van Nostrand Co., Inc., 1968), v.&lt;/ref&gt; Whitehead credits [[William Rowan Hamilton]] and [[Augustus De Morgan]] as originators of the subject matter, and [[James Joseph Sylvester]] with coining the term itself.&lt;ref name="Gratzer" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cf. [[Michel Weber]] and Will Desmond (eds.). ''[https://www.academia.edu/279955/Handbook_of_Whiteheadian_Process_Thought Handbook of Whiteheadian Process Thought]'' (Frankfurt / Lancaster, Ontos Verlag, Process Thought X1 &amp; X2, 2008) and Ronny Desmet &amp; Michel Weber (edited by), ''[https://www.academia.edu/279940/Whitehead._The_Algebra_of_Metaphysics Whitehead. The Algebra of Metaphysics. Applied Process Metaphysics Summer Institute Memorandum]'', Louvain-la-Neuve, Les Éditions Chromatika, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time structures such as [[Lie algebras]] and [[hyperbolic quaternion]]s drew attention to the need to expand algebraic structures beyond the associatively multiplicative class. In a review [[Alexander Macfarlane]] wrote: "The main idea of the work is not unification of the several methods, nor generalization of ordinary algebra so as to include them, but rather the comparative study of their several structures."&lt;ref&gt;[[Alexander Macfarlane]], "Review of A Treatise on Universal Algebra", ''Science'' 9 (1899): 325.&lt;/ref&gt; In a separate review, [[G. B. Mathews]] wrote, "It possesses a unity of design which is really remarkable, considering the variety of its themes."&lt;ref&gt;[[G. B. Mathews]] (1898) [http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v58/n1504/pdf/058385a0.pdf A Treatise on Universal Algebra] from [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] 58:385 to 7 (#1504)&lt;/ref&gt;

''A Treatise on Universal Algebra'' sought to examine [[Hermann Grassmann]]'s theory of extension ("Ausdehnungslehre"), [[George Boole|Boole]]'s algebra of logic, and Hamilton's [[quaternion]]s (this last number system was to be taken up in Volume II, which was never finished due to Whitehead's work on ''Principia Mathematica'').&lt;ref&gt;Victor Lowe, ''Alfred North Whitehead: The Man and his Work, Vol I'' (Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins Press, 1985), 190–191.&lt;/ref&gt;  Whitehead wrote in the preface:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Such algebras have an intrinsic value for separate detailed study; also they are worthy of comparative study, for the sake of the light thereby thrown on the general theory of symbolic reasoning, and on algebraic symbolism in particular&amp;nbsp;... The idea of a generalized conception of space has been made prominent, in the belief that the properties and operations involved in it can be made to form a uniform method of interpretation of the various algebras."&lt;ref&gt;Alfred North Whitehead, ''A Treatise on Universal Algebra'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1898), v.  Available online at http://projecteuclid.org/DPubS/Repository/1.0/Disseminate?handle=euclid.chmm/1263316510&amp;view=body&amp;content-type=pdf_1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Whitehead, however, had no results of a general nature.&lt;ref name="Gratzer" /&gt; His hope of "form[ing] a uniform method of interpretation of the various algebras" presumably would have been developed in Volume II, had Whitehead completed it. Further work on the subject was minimal until the early 1930s, when [[Garrett Birkhoff]] and [[Øystein Ore]] began publishing on universal algebras.&lt;ref&gt;Barron Brainerd, "Review of ''Universal Algebra'' by [[P. M. Cohn]]", ''[[American Mathematical Monthly]]'', 74 (1967): 878–880.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Principia Mathematica''===
[[Image:Russell, Whitehead - Principia Mathematica to 56.jpg|210px|right|thumb|The title page of the shortened version of the ''Principia Mathematica to *56'']]
''[[Principia Mathematica]]'' (1910–1913) is Whitehead's most famous mathematical work.  Co-written with former student [[Bertrand Russell]], ''Principia Mathematica'' is considered one of the twentieth century's most important works in mathematics, and placed 23rd in a list of the top 100 English-language nonfiction books of the twentieth century by [[Modern Library]].&lt;ref name="nytimes" /&gt;

''Principia Mathematica''{{'}}s purpose was to describe a set of [[axiom]]s and [[inference rule]]s in [[symbolic logic]] from which all mathematical truths could in principle be proven.  Whitehead and Russell were working on such a foundational level of [[mathematics]] and [[logic]] that it took them until page 86 of Volume II to prove that 1+1=2, a [[Mathematical proof|proof]] humorously accompanied by the comment, "The above proposition is occasionally useful."&lt;ref&gt;Alfred North Whitehead, ''Principia Mathematica Volume 2'', Second Edition (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1950), 83.&lt;/ref&gt;

Whitehead and Russell had thought originally that ''Principia Mathematica'' would take a year to complete; it ended up taking them ten years.&lt;ref name="books.google"&gt;Hal Hellman, ''Great Feuds in Mathematics: Ten of the Liveliest Disputes Ever'' (Hoboken: John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2006).  Available online at https://books.google.com/books?id=ft8bEGf_OOcC&amp;pg=PT12&amp;lpg=PT12#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; When it came time for publication, the three-volume work was so long (more than 2,000 pages) and its audience so narrow (professional mathematicians) that it was initially published at a loss of 600 pounds, 300 of which was paid by [[Cambridge University Press]], 200 by the [[Royal Society of London]], and 50 apiece by Whitehead and Russell themselves.&lt;ref name="books.google" /&gt;  Despite the initial loss, today there is likely no major [[academic library]] in the world which does not hold a copy of ''Principia Mathematica''.&lt;ref&gt;"''Principia Mathematica''", last modified December 3, 2013, Andrew David Irvine, ed. Edward N. Zalta, ''[[The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'' (Winter 2013 Edition), accessed December 5, 2013, http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/principia-mathematica/#HOPM.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ultimate substantive legacy of ''Principia Mathematica'' is mixed.  It is generally accepted that [[Kurt Gödel]]'s [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems|incompleteness theorem]] of 1931 definitively demonstrated that for any set of axioms and inference rules proposed to encapsulate mathematics, there would in fact be some truths of mathematics which could not be deduced from them, and hence that ''Principia Mathematica'' could never achieve its aims.&lt;ref&gt;[[Stephen Cole Kleene]], ''Mathematical Logic'' (New York: Wiley, 1967), 250.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, Gödel could not have come to this conclusion without Whitehead and Russell's book.  In this way, ''Principia Mathematica'''s legacy might be described as its key role in disproving the possibility of achieving its own stated goals.&lt;ref&gt;"'Principia Mathematica' Celebrates 100 Years", last modified December 22, 2010, ''[[NPR]]'', accessed November 21, 2013, https://www.npr.org/2010/12/22/132265870/Principia-Mathematica-Celebrates-100-Years
&lt;/ref&gt;  But beyond this somewhat ironic legacy, the book popularized modern mathematical logic and drew important connections between logic, [[epistemology]], and [[metaphysics]].&lt;ref&gt;"''Principia Mathematica''", last modified December 3, 2013, Andrew David Irvine, ed.

===''An Introduction to Mathematics''===
Unlike Whitehead's previous two books on mathematics, ''An Introduction to Mathematics'' (1911) was not aimed exclusively at professional mathematicians, but was intended for a larger audience.  The book covered the nature of mathematics, its unity and internal structure, and its applicability to nature.&lt;ref name="religion-online" /&gt;  Whitehead wrote in the opening chapter:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The object of the following Chapters is not to teach mathematics, but to enable students from the very beginning of their course to know what the science is about, and why it is necessarily the foundation of exact thought as applied to natural phenomena."&lt;ref&gt;Alfred North Whitehead, ''An Introduction to Mathematics'', (New York: Henry Holt and Company, 1911), 8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The book can be seen as an attempt to understand the growth in unity and interconnection of mathematics as a whole, as well as an examination of the mutual influence of mathematics and philosophy, language, and physics.&lt;ref&gt;Christoph Wassermann, "The Relevance of An Introduction to Mathematics to Whitehead's Philosophy", ''Process Studies'' 17 (1988): 181–182.

==Views on education==
Whitehead showed a deep concern for [[educational reform]] at all levels.  In addition to his numerous individually written works on the subject, Whitehead was appointed by Britain's [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[David Lloyd George]] as part of a 20-person committee to investigate the educational systems and practices of the UK in 1921 and recommend reform.&lt;ref&gt;Committee To Inquire Into the Position of Classics in the Educational System of the United Kingdom, ''Report of the Committee Appointed by the Prime Minister to Inquire into the Position of Classics in the Educational System of the United Kingdom'', (London: His Majesty's Stationery Office, 1921), 1, 282.  Available online at https://archive.org/details/reportofcommitt00grea.&lt;/ref&gt;

Whitehead's most complete work on education is the 1929 book ''The Aims of Education and Other Essays'', which collected numerous essays and addresses by Whitehead on the subject published between 1912 and 1927.  The essay from which ''Aims of Education'' derived its name was delivered as an address in 1916 when Whitehead was president of the London Branch of the [[Mathematical Association]].  In it, he cautioned against the teaching of what he called "[[inert knowledge|inert ideas]]" – ideas that are disconnected scraps of information, with no application to real life or culture.  He opined that "education with inert ideas is not only useless: it is, above all things, harmful."&lt;ref name="AlfredNorth_g"&gt;Alfred North Whitehead, ''The Aims of Education and Other Essays'' (New York: The Free Press, 1967), 1–2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rather than teach small parts of a large number of subjects, Whitehead advocated teaching a relatively few important concepts that the student could organically link to many different areas of knowledge, discovering their application in actual life.&lt;ref&gt;Alfred North Whitehead, ''The Aims of Education and Other Essays'' (New York: The Free Press, 1967), 2.&lt;/ref&gt;  For Whitehead, education should be the exact opposite of the [[multidisciplinary]], value-free school model&lt;ref name="AlfredNorth_g" /&gt;&lt;ref name="blogs.vancouversun" /&gt; – it should be [[Transdisciplinarity|''trans''disciplinary]], and laden with values and general principles that provide students with a bedrock of wisdom and help them to make connections between areas of knowledge that are usually regarded as separate.

In order to make this sort of teaching a reality, however, Whitehead pointed to the need to minimize the importance of (or radically alter) [[Standardized test|standard examinations]] for school entrance.  Whitehead writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Every school is bound on pain of extinction to train its boys for a small set of definite examinations. No headmaster has a free hand to develop his general education or his specialist studies in accordance with the opportunities of his school, which are created by its staff, its environment, its class of boys, and its endowments. I suggest that no system of external tests which aims primarily at examining individual scholars can result in anything but educational waste."&lt;ref&gt;Alfred North Whitehead, ''The Aims of Education and Other Essays'' (New York: The Free Press, 1967), 13.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Whitehead argued that curriculum should be developed specifically for its own students by its own staff, or else risk total stagnation, interrupted only by occasional movements from one group of inert ideas to another.

Above all else in his educational writings, Whitehead emphasized the importance of [[imagination]] and the free play of ideas.  In his essay "Universities and Their Function", Whitehead writes provocatively on imagination:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Imagination is not to be divorced from the facts: it is a way of illuminating the facts.  It works by eliciting the general principles which apply to the facts, as they exist, and then by an intellectual survey of alternative possibilities which are consistent with those principles.  It enables men to construct an intellectual vision of a new world."&lt;ref&gt;Alfred North Whitehead, ''The Aims of Education and Other Essays'' (New York: The Free Press, 1967), 93.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Whitehead's philosophy of education might adequately be summarized in his statement that "knowledge does not keep any better than fish."&lt;ref&gt;Alfred North Whitehead, ''The Aims of Education and Other Essays'' (New York: The Free Press, 1967), 98.&lt;/ref&gt;  In other words, bits of disconnected knowledge are meaningless; all knowledge must find some imaginative application to the students' own lives, or else it becomes so much useless trivia, and the students themselves become good at parroting facts but not thinking for themselves.

==Philosophy and metaphysics==
[[File:Rummell, Richard Harvard University.jpg|thumb|left|400px|Richard Rummell's 1906 watercolor landscape view of Harvard University, facing northeast.&lt;ref&gt;"An Iconic College View: Harvard University, circa 1900. Richard Rummell (1848–1924)", last modified July 6, 2011, Graham Arader, accessed December 5, 2013, http://grahamarader.blogspot.com/2011/07/iconic-college-view-harvard-university.html.&lt;/ref&gt; Whitehead taught at Harvard from 1924 to 1937.]]
Whitehead did not begin his career as a [[philosopher]].&lt;ref name="VictorLowe_c" /&gt;  In fact, he never had any formal training in philosophy beyond his [[undergraduate education]].  Early in his life he showed great interest in and respect for philosophy and [[metaphysics]], but it is evident that he considered himself a rank amateur.  In one letter to his friend and former student [[Bertrand Russell]], after discussing whether science aimed to be explanatory or merely descriptive, he wrote: "This further question lands us in the ocean of metaphysic, onto which my profound ignorance of that science forbids me to enter."&lt;ref&gt;Alfred North Whitehead to Bertrand Russell, February 13, 1895, Bertrand Russell Archives, Archives and Research Collections, McMaster Library, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.&lt;/ref&gt;  Ironically, in later life Whitehead would become one of the 20th century's foremost [[List of metaphysicians|metaphysicians]].

However, interest in metaphysics – the philosophical investigation of the nature of the universe and existence – had become unfashionable by the time Whitehead began writing in earnest about it in the 1920s.  The ever-more impressive accomplishments of [[empirical]] science had led to a general consensus in academia that the development of comprehensive metaphysical systems was a waste of time because they were not subject to [[Empirical research|empirical testing]].&lt;ref&gt;[[A. J. Ayer]], ''Language, Truth and Logic'', (New York: Penguin, 1971), 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

Whitehead was unimpressed by this objection.  In the notes of one of his students for a 1927 class, Whitehead was quoted as saying: "Every scientific man in order to preserve his reputation has to say he dislikes metaphysics.  What he means is he dislikes having his metaphysics criticized."&lt;ref&gt;George P. Conger, "Whitehead lecture notes: Seminary in Logic: Logical and Metaphysical Problems", 1927, Manuscripts and Archives, Yale University Library, Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut.&lt;/ref&gt;  In Whitehead's view, scientists and philosophers make metaphysical assumptions about how the universe works all the time, but such assumptions are not easily seen precisely because they remain unexamined and unquestioned.  While Whitehead acknowledged that "philosophers can never hope finally to formulate these metaphysical [[first principle]]s,"&lt;ref&gt;Alfred North Whitehead, ''Process and Reality'' (New York: The Free Press, 1978), 4.&lt;/ref&gt; he argued that people need to continually re-imagine their basic assumptions about how the universe works if philosophy and science are to make any real progress, even if that progress remains permanently [[asymptotic]].  For this reason Whitehead regarded metaphysical investigations as essential to both good science and good philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Alfred North Whitehead, ''Process and Reality'' (New York: The Free Press, 1978), 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps foremost among what Whitehead considered faulty metaphysical assumptions was the [[René Descartes|Cartesian]] idea that reality is fundamentally constructed of bits of matter that exist totally independently of one another, which he rejected in favor of an [[Event (philosophy)|event]]-based or "process" [[ontology]] in which events are primary and are fundamentally interrelated and dependent on one another.&lt;ref name="AlfredNorth_a"&gt;Alfred North Whitehead, ''Science and the Modern World'' (New York: The Free Press, 1967), 17.&lt;/ref&gt;  He also argued that the most basic elements of reality can all be regarded as experiential, indeed that everything is constituted by its [[experience]]. He used the term "experience" very broadly, so that even inanimate processes such as electron collisions are said to manifest some degree of experience. In this, he went against Descartes' separation of two different kinds of real existence, either exclusively material or else exclusively mental.&lt;ref name="AlfredNorth"&gt;Alfred North Whitehead, ''Process and Reality'' (New York: The Free Press, 1978), 18.&lt;/ref&gt;  Whitehead referred to his metaphysical system as "philosophy of organism", but it would become known more widely as "[[process philosophy]]."&lt;ref name="AlfredNorth" /&gt;

Whitehead's philosophy was highly original, and soon garnered interest in philosophical circles.  After publishing ''The Concept of Nature'' in 1920, he served as president of the [[Aristotelian Society]] from 1922 to 1923, and [[Henri Bergson]] was quoted as saying that Whitehead was "the best philosopher writing in English."&lt;ref&gt;Victor Lowe, ''Alfred North Whitehead: The Man and his Work, Vol II'' (Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins Press, 1990), 127, 133.&lt;/ref&gt;  So impressive and different was Whitehead's philosophy that in 1924 he was invited to join the faculty at [[Harvard University]] as a professor of philosophy at 63 years of age.&lt;ref name="VictorLowe_d" /&gt;

[[Image:Eckhart Hall.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Eckhart Hall at the [[University of Chicago]]. Beginning with the arrival of [[Henry Nelson Wieman]] in 1927, Chicago's [[University of Chicago Divinity School|Divinity School]] become closely associated with Whitehead's thought for about thirty years.&lt;ref name="GaryDorrien_a"&gt;Gary Dorrien, ''The Making of American Liberal Theology: Crisis, Irony, and Postmodernity, 1950–2005'' (Louisville: Westminster John Knox Press, 2006), 123–124.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
This is not to say that Whitehead's thought was widely accepted or even well understood.  His philosophical work is generally considered to be among the most difficult to understand in all of the [[western canon]].&lt;ref name="PhilipRose" /&gt;  Even professional philosophers struggled to follow Whitehead's writings.  One famous story illustrating the level of difficulty of Whitehead's philosophy centers around the delivery of Whitehead's [[Gifford lectures]] in 1927–28 – following [[Arthur Eddington]]'s lectures of the year previous – which Whitehead would later publish as ''[[Process and Reality]]'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;Eddington was a marvellous popular lecturer who had enthralled an audience of 600 for his entire course.  The same audience turned up to Whitehead's first lecture but it was completely unintelligible, not merely to the world at large but to the elect.  My father remarked to me afterwards that if he had not known Whitehead well he would have suspected that it was an imposter making it up as he went along&amp;nbsp;... The audience at subsequent lectures was only about half a dozen in all.&lt;ref&gt;Victor Lowe, ''Alfred North Whitehead: The Man and his Work, Vol II'' (Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins Press, 1990), 250.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Indeed, it may not be inappropriate to speculate that some fair portion of the respect generally shown to Whitehead by his philosophical peers at the time arose from their sheer bafflement.  Distinguished [[University of Chicago Divinity School]] [[theologian]] [[Shailer Mathews]] once remarked of Whitehead's 1926 book ''Religion in the Making'': "It is infuriating, and I must say embarrassing as well, to read page after page of relatively familiar words without understanding a single sentence."&lt;ref name="GaryDorrien"&gt;[[Gary Dorrien]], "The Lure and Necessity of Process Theology", ''CrossCurrents'' 58 (2008): 320.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Mathews' frustration with Whitehead's books did not negatively affect his interest.  In fact, there were numerous philosophers and theologians at Chicago's Divinity School that perceived the importance of what Whitehead was doing without fully grasping all of the details and implications.  In 1927 they invited one of America's only Whitehead experts – [[Henry Nelson Wieman]] – to Chicago to give a lecture explaining Whitehead's thought.&lt;ref name="GaryDorrien" /&gt;  Wieman's lecture was so brilliant that he was promptly hired to the faculty and taught there for twenty years, and for at least thirty years afterward Chicago's Divinity School was closely associated with Whitehead's thought.&lt;ref name="GaryDorrien_a" /&gt;

Shortly after Whitehead's book ''[[Process and Reality]]'' appeared in 1929, Wieman famously wrote in his 1930 review:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Not many people will read Whitehead's recent book in this generation; not many will read it in any generation. But its influence will radiate through concentric circles of popularization until the common man will think and work in the light of it, not knowing whence the light came. After a few decades of discussion and analysis one will be able to understand it more readily than can now be done."&lt;ref&gt;[[Henry Nelson Wieman]], "A Philosophy of Religion", ''The Journal of Religion'' 10 (1930): 137.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Wieman's words proved prophetic.  Though ''Process and Reality'' has been called "arguably the most impressive single metaphysical text of the twentieth century,"&lt;ref&gt;Peter Simons, "Metaphysical systematics: A lesson from Whitehead", ''Erkenntnis'' 48 (1998), 378.&lt;/ref&gt; it has been little-read and little-understood, partly because it demands – as Isabelle Stengers puts it – "that its readers accept the adventure of the questions that will separate them from every consensus."&lt;ref name="IsabelleStengers"&gt;[[Isabelle Stengers]], ''Thinking with Whitehead: A Free and Wild Creation of Concepts'', trans. Michael Chase (Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press, 2011), 6.&lt;/ref&gt;  Whitehead questioned western philosophy's most dearly held assumptions about how the universe works, but in doing so he managed to anticipate a number of 21st century scientific and philosophical problems and provide novel solutions.&lt;ref&gt;[[David Ray Griffin]], ''Whitehead's Radically Different Postmodern Philosophy: An Argument for Its Contemporary Relevance'' (Albany: State University of New York Press, 2007), viii–ix.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Whitehead's conception of reality===
Whitehead was convinced that the scientific notion of [[matter]] was misleading as a way of describing the ultimate nature of things.  In his 1925 book ''Science and the Modern World'', he wrote that

&lt;blockquote&gt;"There persists&amp;nbsp;... [a] fixed scientific [[cosmology]] which presupposes the ultimate fact of an irreducible brute [[matter]], or material, spread through space in a flux of configurations.  In itself such a material is senseless, valueless, purposeless.  It just does what it does do, following a fixed routine imposed by external relations which do not spring from the nature of its being.  It is this assumption that I call 'scientific materialism.'  Also it is an assumption which I shall challenge as being entirely unsuited to the scientific situation at which we have now arrived."&lt;ref name="AlfredNorth_a" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In Whitehead's view, there are a number of problems with this notion of "irreducible brute matter."  First, it obscures and minimizes the importance of change.  By thinking of any material thing (like a rock, or a person) as being fundamentally the ''same'' thing throughout time, with any changes to it being secondary to its "[[Nature (innate)|nature]]", scientific materialism hides the fact that nothing ever stays the same.  For Whitehead, change is fundamental and inescapable; he emphasizes that "all things flow."&lt;ref&gt;Alfred North Whitehead, ''Process and Reality'' (New York: The Free Press, 1978), 208.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Whitehead's view, then, concepts such as "quality", "matter", and "form" are problematic. These "classical" concepts fail to adequately account for change, and overlook the active and experiential nature of the most basic elements of the world. They are useful [[abstraction]]s, but are not the world's basic building blocks.&lt;ref&gt;Alfred North Whitehead, ''Science and the Modern World'' (New York: The Free Press, 1967), 52–55.&lt;/ref&gt;  What is ordinarily conceived of as a single person, for instance, is philosophically described as a continuum of overlapping [[Event (philosophy)|event]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Alfred North Whitehead, ''Process and Reality'' (New York: The Free Press, 1978), 34–35.&lt;/ref&gt;  After all, people change all the time, if only because they have aged by another second and had some further experience.  These occasions of experience are logically distinct, but are progressively connected in what Whitehead calls a "society" of events.&lt;ref&gt;Alfred North Whitehead, ''Process and Reality'' (New York: The Free Press, 1978), 34.&lt;/ref&gt;  By assuming that enduring objects are the most real and fundamental things in the universe, materialists have mistaken the abstract for the [[Abstract and concrete|concrete]] (what Whitehead calls the "[[fallacy of misplaced concreteness]]").&lt;ref name="AlfredNorth" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alfred North Whitehead, ''Science and the Modern World'' (New York: The Free Press, 1967), 54–55.&lt;/ref&gt;

To put it another way, a thing or person is often seen as having a "defining [[essence]]" or a "core [[Personal identity|identity]]" that is unchanging, and describes what the thing or person ''really is''. In this way of thinking, things and people are seen as fundamentally the same through time, with any changes being qualitative and secondary to their core identity (e.g. "Mark's hair has turned gray as he has gotten older, but he is still the same person"). But in Whitehead's cosmology, the only fundamentally existent things are discrete "occasions of experience" that overlap one another in time and space, and jointly make up the enduring person or thing. On the other hand, what ordinary thinking often regards as "the essence of a thing" or "the identity/core of a person" is an abstract generalization of what is regarded as that person or thing's most important or salient features across time.  Identities do not define people, people define identities.  Everything changes from moment to moment, and to think of anything as having an "enduring essence" misses the fact that "all things flow", though it is often a useful way of speaking.

Whitehead pointed to the limitations of language as one of the main culprits in maintaining a materialistic way of thinking, and acknowledged that it may be difficult to ever wholly move past such ideas in everyday speech.&lt;ref&gt;Alfred North Whitehead, ''Process and Reality'' (New York: The Free Press, 1978), 183.&lt;/ref&gt;  After all, each moment of each person's life can hardly be given a different proper name, and it is easy and convenient to think of people and objects as remaining fundamentally the same things, rather than constantly keeping in mind that each thing is a different thing from what it was a moment ago.  Yet the limitations of everyday living and everyday speech should not prevent people from realizing that "material substances" or "essences" are a convenient generalized description of a continuum of particular, concrete processes.  No one questions that a ten-year-old person is quite different by the time he or she turns thirty years old, and in many ways is not the same person at all; Whitehead points out that it is not philosophically or [[ontologically]] sound to think that a person is the same from one second to the next.

[[Image:JohnLocke.png|210px|left|thumb|[[John Locke]] was one of Whitehead's primary influences.  In the preface to ''[[Process and Reality]]'', Whitehead wrote: "The writer who most fully anticipated the main positions of the [[philosophy of organism]] is John Locke in his [[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding|Essay]]."&lt;ref name="AlfredNorth_i" /&gt;]]
A second problem with materialism is that it obscures the importance of ''relations''.  It sees every object as distinct and discrete from all other objects.  Each object is simply an inert clump of matter that is only ''externally'' related to other things.  The idea of matter as primary makes people think of objects as being fundamentally separate in time and space, and not necessarily related to anything.  But in Whitehead's view, relations take a primary role, perhaps even more important than the relata themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Alfred North Whitehead, ''Symbolism: Its Meaning and Effect'' (New York: Fordham University Press, 1985), 38–39.&lt;/ref&gt;  A student taking notes in one of Whitehead's fall 1924 classes wrote that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Reality applies to ''connections'', and only relatively to the things connected.  (A) is real for (B), and (B) is real for (A), but [they are] not absolutely real independent of each other."&lt;ref&gt;Louise R. Heath, "Notes on Whitehead's Philosophy 3b: Philosophical Presuppositions of Science", September 27, 1924, Whitehead Research Project, Center for Process Studies, Claremont, California.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In fact, Whitehead describes any entity as in some sense nothing more and nothing less than the sum of its relations to other entities – its ''synthesis of'' and ''reaction to'' the world around it.&lt;ref&gt;Alfred North Whitehead, ''Symbolism: Its Meaning and Effect'' (New York: Fordham University Press, 1985), 26.&lt;/ref&gt;  A real thing is just that which forces the rest of the [[universe]] to in some way conform to it; that is to say, if theoretically a thing made strictly no difference to any other entity (i.e. it was not ''related'' to any other entity), it could not be said to really exist.&lt;ref name="AlfredNorth_b"&gt;Alfred North Whitehead, ''Symbolism: Its Meaning and Effect'' (New York: Fordham University Press, 1985), 39.&lt;/ref&gt;  Relations are not secondary to what a thing is, they ''are'' what the thing is.

It must be emphasized{{why|date=October 2016}}, however, that an entity is not ''merely'' a sum of its relations, but also a valuation of them and reaction to them.&lt;ref&gt;Alfred North Whitehead, ''Process and Reality'' (New York: The Free Press, 1978), 19.&lt;/ref&gt;  For Whitehead, [[creativity]] is the absolute principle of existence, and every entity (whether it is a human being, a tree, or an [[electron]]) has some degree of novelty in how it responds to other entities, and is not fully determined by [[Causation (law)|causal]] or [[Mechanism (philosophy)|mechanistic]] laws.&lt;ref&gt;Alfred North Whitehead, ''Process and Reality'' (New York: The Free Press, 1978), 21.&lt;/ref&gt;  Of course, most entities do not have [[consciousness]].&lt;ref name="AlfredNorth_c"&gt;Alfred North Whitehead, ''Process and Reality'' (New York: The Free Press, 1978), 23.&lt;/ref&gt;  As a human being's actions cannot always be predicted, the same can be said of where a tree's roots will grow, or how an electron will move, or whether it will rain tomorrow.  Moreover, inability to predict an electron's movement (for instance) is not due to faulty understanding or inadequate technology; rather, the fundamental creativity/freedom of all entities means that there will always remain phenomena that are unpredictable.&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Hartshorne]], "Freedom Requires Indeterminism and Universal Causality", ''The Journal of Philosophy'' 55 (1958): 794.&lt;/ref&gt;

The other side of creativity/freedom as the absolute principle is that every entity is constrained by the social structure of existence (i.e., its relations) – each actual entity must conform to the settled conditions of the world around it.&lt;ref name="AlfredNorth_b" /&gt;  Freedom always exists within limits.  But an entity's uniqueness and individuality arise from its own self-determination as to just how it will take account of the world within the limits that have been set for it.&lt;ref&gt;[[John B. Cobb]], ''A Christian Natural Theology'' (Louisville: Westminster John Knox Press, 1978), 52.&lt;/ref&gt;

In summary, Whitehead rejects the idea of separate and unchanging bits of matter as the most basic building blocks of reality, in favor of the idea of reality as interrelated events in process.  He conceives of reality as composed of processes of dynamic "becoming" rather than static "being", emphasizing that all physical things change and evolve, and that changeless "essences" such as matter are mere abstractions from the interrelated events that are the final real things that make up the world.&lt;ref name="AlfredNorth"/&gt;

===Theory of perception===
Since Whitehead's [[metaphysics]] described a universe in which all entities [[Experience#Subjective experience|experience]], he needed a new way of describing [[perception]] that was not limited to living, [[self-conscious]] beings.  The term he coined was "prehension", which comes from the Latin ''prehensio'', meaning "to seize."&lt;ref name="DavidRay"&gt;[[David Ray Griffin]], ''Reenchantment Without Supernaturalism: A Process Philosophy of Religion'' (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 2001), 79.&lt;/ref&gt;  The term is meant to indicate a kind of perception that can be conscious or unconscious, applying to people as well as [[electron]]s.  It is also intended to make clear Whitehead's rejection of the theory of ''representative'' perception, in which the [[mind]] only has private ideas about other entities.&lt;ref name="DavidRay" /&gt;  For Whitehead, the term "prehension" indicates that the perceiver actually incorporates aspects of the perceived thing into itself.&lt;ref name="DavidRay" /&gt;  In this way, entities are constituted by their perceptions and relations, rather than being independent of them.  Further, Whitehead regards perception as occurring in two modes, ''causal efficacy'' (or "physical prehension") and ''presentational immediacy'' (or "conceptual prehension").&lt;ref name="AlfredNorth_c" /&gt;

Whitehead describes causal efficacy as "the experience dominating the primitive living organisms, which have a sense for the fate from which they have emerged, and the fate towards which they go."&lt;ref&gt;Alfred North Whitehead, ''Symbolism: Its Meaning and Effect'' (New York: Fordham University Press, 1985), 44.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is, in other words, the sense of [[causal]] relations between entities, a feeling of being influenced and affected by the surrounding environment, unmediated by the [[sense]]s.  Presentational immediacy, on the other hand, is what is usually referred to as "pure sense perception", unmediated by any causal or [[symbol]]ic [[Interpretation (philosophy)|interpretation]], even [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]] interpretation.  In other words, it is pure appearance, which may or may not be delusive (e.g. mistaking an image in a mirror for "the real thing").&lt;ref&gt;Alfred North Whitehead, ''Symbolism: Its Meaning and Effect'' (New York: Fordham University Press, 1985), 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

In higher organisms (like people), these two modes of perception combine into what Whitehead terms "symbolic reference", which links appearance with causation in a process that is so automatic that both people and animals have difficulty refraining from it.  By way of illustration, Whitehead uses the example of a person's encounter with a chair.  An ordinary person looks up, sees a colored shape, and immediately infers that it is a chair.  However, an artist, Whitehead supposes, "might not have jumped to the notion of a chair", but instead "might have stopped at the mere contemplation of a beautiful color and a beautiful shape."&lt;ref&gt;Alfred North Whitehead, ''Symbolism: Its Meaning and Effect'' (New York: Fordham University Press, 1985), 3.&lt;/ref&gt;  This is not the normal human reaction; most people place objects in categories by habit and instinct, without even thinking about it.  Moreover, animals do the same thing.  Using the same example, Whitehead points out that a dog "would have acted immediately on the hypothesis of a chair and would have jumped onto it by way of using it as such."&lt;ref&gt;Alfred North Whitehead, ''Symbolism: Its Meaning and Effect'' (New York: Fordham University Press, 1985), 4.&lt;/ref&gt;  In this way symbolic reference is a fusion of pure sense perceptions on the one hand and causal relations on the other, and that it is in fact the causal relationships that dominate the more basic mentality (as the dog illustrates), while it is the sense perceptions which indicate a higher grade mentality (as the artist illustrates).&lt;ref&gt;Alfred North Whitehead, ''Symbolism: Its Meaning and Effect'' (New York: Fordham University Press, 1985), 49.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evolution and value===
Whitehead believed that when asking questions about the basic facts of existence, questions about [[Teleology|value and purpose]] can never be fully escaped.  This is borne out in his thoughts on [[abiogenesis]], or the hypothetical natural process by which life arises from simple organic compounds.

Whitehead makes the startling observation that "life is comparatively deficient in survival value."&lt;ref&gt;Alfred North Whitehead, ''The Function of Reason'' (Boston: Beacon Press, 1958), 4.&lt;/ref&gt;  If humans can only exist for about a hundred years, and rocks for eight hundred million, then one is forced to ask why complex organisms ever evolved in the first place; as Whitehead humorously notes, "they certainly did not appear because they were better at that game than the rocks around them."&lt;ref&gt;Alfred North Whitehead, ''The Function of Reason'' (Boston: Beacon Press, 1958), 4–5.&lt;/ref&gt;  He then observes that the mark of higher forms of life is that they are actively engaged in modifying their environment, an activity which he theorizes is directed toward the three-fold goal of living, living well, and living better.&lt;ref&gt;Alfred North Whitehead, ''The Function of Reason'' (Boston: Beacon Press, 1958), 8.&lt;/ref&gt;  In other words, Whitehead sees life as directed toward the purpose of increasing its own satisfaction.  Without such a goal, he sees the rise of life as totally unintelligible.

For Whitehead, there is no such thing as wholly inert [[matter]].  Instead, all things have some measure of freedom or [[creativity]], however small, which allows them to be at least partly self-directed. [[Process philosophy|Process philosopher]] [[David Ray Griffin]] coined the term "[[Panexperientialism#Panexperientialism|panexperientialism]]" (the idea that all entities experience) to describe Whitehead's view, and to distinguish it from [[panpsychism]] (the idea that all matter has [[consciousness]]).&lt;ref&gt;[[David Ray Griffin]], ''Reenchantment Without Supernaturalism: A Process Philosophy of Religion'' (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 2001), 97.&lt;/ref&gt;

Whitehead's idea of [[God]] differs from traditional monotheistic notions.&lt;ref&gt;[[Roland Faber]], ''God as Poet of the World: Exploring Process Theologies'' (Louisville: Westminster John Knox Press, 2008), chapters 4–5.&lt;/ref&gt;  Perhaps his most famous and pointed [[Criticism of Christianity|criticism of the Christian conception of God]] is that "the Church gave unto God the attributes which belonged exclusively to [[Caesar]]."&lt;ref&gt;Alfred North Whitehead, ''Process and Reality'' (New York: The Free Press, 1978), 342.&lt;/ref&gt;  Here Whitehead is criticizing Christianity for defining [[Theocracy|God as primarily a divine king]] who imposes his will on the world, and whose most important attribute is power. As opposed to the most widely accepted forms of Christianity, Whitehead emphasized an idea of God that he called "the brief Galilean vision of humility":

&lt;blockquote&gt;"It does not emphasize the ruling Caesar, or the ruthless moralist, or the unmoved mover. It dwells upon the tender elements in the world, which slowly and in quietness operates by love; and it finds purpose in the present immediacy of a kingdom not of this world. Love neither rules, nor is it unmoved; also it is a little oblivious as to [[morals]]. It does not look to the future; for it finds its own reward in the immediate present."&lt;ref name="AlfredNorth_e"&gt;Alfred North Whitehead, ''Process and Reality'' (New York: The Free Press, 1978), 343.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It should be emphasized that for Whitehead, God is not necessarily tied to [[religion]].&lt;ref name="AlfredNorth_d"&gt;Alfred North Whitehead, ''Process and Reality'' (New York: The Free Press, 1978), 207.&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than springing primarily from religious [[faith]], Whitehead saw God as necessary for his [[metaphysical]] system.&lt;ref name="AlfredNorth_d" /&gt; His system required that an order exist among possibilities, an order that allowed for novelty in the world and provided an aim to all entities. Whitehead posited that these ordered potentials exist in what he called the ''primordial nature'' of God. However, Whitehead was also interested in [[religious experience]]. This led him to reflect more intensively on what he saw as the second nature of God, the ''consequent nature''. Whitehead's conception of God as a "dipolar"&lt;ref&gt;Alfred North Whitehead, ''Process and Reality'' (New York: The Free Press, 1978), 345.&lt;/ref&gt; entity has called for fresh [[theological]] thinking.

The primordial nature he described as "the unlimited conceptual realization of the absolute wealth of potentiality,"&lt;ref name="AlfredNorth_e" /&gt; i.e., the unlimited possibility of the universe.  This primordial nature is [[Eternity|eternal]] and [[Immutability (theology)|unchanging]], providing entities in the universe with possibilities for realization.  Whitehead also calls this primordial aspect "the lure for [[feeling]], the eternal urge of desire,"&lt;ref&gt;Alfred North Whitehead, ''Process and Reality'' (New York: The Free Press, 1978), 344.&lt;/ref&gt; pulling the entities in the universe toward as-yet unrealized possibilities.

God's consequent nature, on the other hand, is anything but unchanging – it is God's reception of the world's activity.  As Whitehead puts it, "[God] saves the world as it passes into the immediacy of his own life.  It is the judgment of a tenderness which loses nothing that can be saved."&lt;ref&gt;Alfred North Whitehead, ''Process and Reality'' (New York: The Free Press, 1978), 346.&lt;/ref&gt;  In other words, God saves and cherishes all experiences forever, and those experiences go on to change the way God interacts with the world.  In this way, God is really changed by what happens in the world and the wider universe, lending the actions of finite creatures an eternal significance.

Whitehead thus sees [[Panentheism|God and the world as fulfilling one another]]. He sees entities in the world as fluent and changing things that yearn for a permanence which only God can provide by taking them into God's self, thereafter changing God and affecting the rest of the universe throughout time.  On the other hand, he sees God as permanent but as deficient in actuality and change: alone, God is merely eternally unrealized possibilities, and requires the world to actualize them.  God gives creatures permanence, while the creatures give God actuality and change.  Here it is worthwhile to quote Whitehead at length:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"In this way God is completed by the individual, fluent satisfactions of finite fact, and the temporal occasions are completed by their everlasting union with their transformed selves, purged into conformation with the eternal order which is the final absolute 'wisdom.'  The final summary can only be expressed in terms of a group of [[antitheses]], whose apparent self-contradictions depend on neglect of the diverse categories of existence. In each antithesis there is a shift of meaning which converts the opposition into a contrast.

"It is as true to say that God is permanent and the World fluent, as that the World is permanent and God is fluent.

"It is as true to say that God is one and the World many, as that the World is one and God many.

"It is as true to say that, in comparison with the World, God is actual eminently, as that, in comparison with God, the World is actual eminently.

"It is as true to say that the World is [[immanent]] in God, as that God is immanent in the World.

"It is as true to say that God transcends the World, as that the World transcends God.

"It is as true to say that God creates the World, as that the World creates God&amp;nbsp;...

"What is done in the world is transformed into a reality in heaven, and the reality in heaven passes back into the world&amp;nbsp;... In this sense, God is the great companion – the fellow-sufferer who understands."&lt;ref&gt;Alfred North Whitehead, ''Process and Reality'' (New York: The Free Press, 1978), 347–348, 351.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The above is some of Whitehead's most evocative writing about God, and was powerful enough to inspire the movement known as [[process theology]], a vibrant theological school of thought that continues to thrive today.&lt;ref name="Bruce"&gt;[[Bruce G. Epperly]], ''Process Theology: A Guide for the Perplexed'' (New York: T&amp;T Clark, 2011), 12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Roland Faber]], ''God as Poet of the World: Exploring Process Theologies'' (Louisville: Westminster John Knox Press, 2008), chapter 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religion===
For Whitehead the core of religion was individual.  While he acknowledged that individuals cannot ever be fully separated from their society, he argued that life is an internal fact for its own sake before it is an external fact relating to others.&lt;ref&gt;Alfred North Whitehead, ''Religion in the Making'' (New York: Fordham University Press, 1996), 15–16.&lt;/ref&gt;  His most famous remark on religion is that "religion is what the individual does with his own solitariness&amp;nbsp;... and if you are never solitary, you are never religious."&lt;ref&gt;Alfred North Whitehead, ''Religion in the Making'' (New York: Fordham University Press, 1996), 16–17.&lt;/ref&gt;  Whitehead saw religion as a system of general truths that transformed a person's [[Character structure|character]].&lt;ref&gt;Alfred North Whitehead, ''Religion in the Making'' (New York: Fordham University Press, 1996), 15.&lt;/ref&gt;  He took special care to note that while religion is often a good influence, it is not ''necessarily'' good – an idea which he called a "dangerous delusion" (e.g., a religion might encourage the violent extermination of a rival religion's adherents).&lt;ref&gt;Alfred North Whitehead, ''Religion in the Making'' (New York: Fordham University Press, 1996), 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, while Whitehead saw religion as ''beginning'' in solitariness, he also saw religion as necessarily expanding beyond the individual.  In keeping with his [[Process philosophy#Process metaphysics|process metaphysics]] in which relations are primary, he wrote that religion necessitates the realization of "the value of the objective world which is a community derivative from the interrelations of its component individuals."&lt;ref&gt;Alfred North Whitehead, ''Religion in the Making'' (New York: Fordham University Press, 1996), 59.&lt;/ref&gt;   In other words, the universe is a community which makes itself whole through the relatedness of each individual entity to all the others – meaning and value do not exist for the individual alone, but only in the context of the universal community.  Whitehead writes further that each entity "can find no such value till it has merged its individual claim with that of the objective universe.  Religion is world-loyalty.  The spirit at once surrenders itself to this universal claim and appropriates it for itself."&lt;ref&gt;Alfred North Whitehead, ''Religion in the Making'' (New York: Fordham University Press, 1996), 60.&lt;/ref&gt;   In this way the individual and universal/social aspects of religion are mutually dependent.

Whitehead also described religion more technically as "an ultimate craving to infuse into the insistent particularity of [[emotion]] that non-temporal generality which primarily belongs to conceptual thought alone."&lt;ref&gt;Alfred North Whitehead, ''Process and Reality'' (New York: The Free Press, 1978), 16.&lt;/ref&gt;  In other words, religion takes deeply felt emotions and contextualizes them within a system of general truths about the world, helping people to identify their wider meaning and significance.  For Whitehead, religion served as a kind of bridge between philosophy and the emotions and purposes of a particular society.&lt;ref&gt;Alfred North Whitehead, ''Process and Reality'' (New York: The Free Press, 1978), 15.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is the task of religion to make philosophy applicable to the everyday lives of ordinary people.

==Influence and legacy==
[[Isabelle Stengers]] wrote that "Whiteheadians are recruited among both [[philosopher]]s and [[theologian]]s, and the palette has been enriched by practitioners from the most diverse horizons, from [[ecology]] to [[feminism]], practices that unite political struggle and [[spirituality]] with the [[Pedagogy|sciences of education]]."&lt;ref name="IsabelleStengers" /&gt;  Indeed, in recent decades attention to Whitehead's work has become more widespread, with interest extending to intellectuals in Europe and China, and coming from such diverse fields as ecology, physics, biology, education, economics, and psychology.  One of the first theologians to attempt to interact with Whitehead's thought was the future Archbishop of Canterbury, [[William Temple (bishop)|William Temple]]. In Temple's [[Gifford Lectures]] of 1932-1934 (subsequently published as "Nature, Man and God"), Whitehead is one of a number of philosophers of the [[emergent evolution]] approach Temple interacts with.&lt;ref&gt;George Garin, "Theistic Evolution in a Sacramental Universe: The Theology of William Temple Against the Background of Process Thinkers (Whitehead, Alexander, Etc.)," (Protestant University Press, Kinshasa, The Congo, 1991).&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was not until the 1970s and 1980s that Whitehead's thought drew much attention outside of a small group of philosophers and theologians, primarily Americans, and even today he is not considered especially influential outside of relatively specialized circles.

Early followers of Whitehead were found primarily at the [[University of Chicago Divinity School|University of Chicago's Divinity School]], where [[Henry Nelson Wieman]] initiated an interest in Whitehead's work that would last for about thirty years.&lt;ref name="GaryDorrien_a" /&gt;  Professors such as Wieman, [[Charles Hartshorne]], [[Bernard Loomer]], Bernard Meland, and [[Daniel Day Williams]] made Whitehead's philosophy arguably the most important intellectual thread running through the Divinity School.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gary Dorrien]], "The Lure and Necessity of Process Theology", ''CrossCurrents'' 58 (2008): 321–322.&lt;/ref&gt;  They taught generations of Whitehead scholars, the most notable of which is [[John B. Cobb]], Jr.

Although interest in Whitehead has since faded at Chicago's Divinity School, Cobb effectively grabbed the torch and planted it firmly in [[Claremont, California]], where he began teaching at [[Claremont School of Theology]] in 1958 and founded the [[Center for Process Studies]] with [[David Ray Griffin]] in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;[[David Ray Griffin]], "[[John B. Cobb]], Jr.: A Theological Biography", in ''Theology and the University: Essays in Honor of John B. Cobb, Jr.'', ed. David Ray Griffin and Joseph C. Hough, Jr. (Albany: State University of New York Press, 1991), 229.&lt;/ref&gt;  Largely due to Cobb's influence, today Claremont remains strongly identified with Whitehead's process thought.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gary Dorrien]], "The Lure and Necessity of Process Theology", ''CrossCurrents'' 58 (2008): 334.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="VictorLowe_e"&gt;Victor Lowe, ''Alfred North Whitehead: The Man and his Work, Vol I'' (Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins Press, 1985), 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

But while Claremont remains the most concentrated hub of Whiteheadian activity, the place where Whitehead's thought currently seems to be growing the most quickly is in China.  In order to address the challenges of [[modernization]] and [[industrialization]], China has begun to blend traditions of [[Taoism]], [[Buddhism]], and [[Confucianism]] with Whitehead's "constructive post-modern" philosophy in order to create an "ecological civilization."&lt;ref name="blogs.vancouversun"&gt;"China embraces Alfred North Whitehead", last modified December 10, 2008, Douglas Todd, ''[[The Vancouver Sun]]'', accessed December 5, 2013, http://blogs.vancouversun.com/2008/12/10/china-embraces-alfred-north-whitehead/.&lt;/ref&gt;  To date, the Chinese government has encouraged the building of twenty-three university-based centers for the study of Whitehead's philosophy,&lt;ref name="blogs.vancouversun" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us |publisher=The Institute for the Postmodern Development of China |access-date=November 21, 2013 |url=http://www.postmodernchina.org/cgi/aboutUs.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202230254/http://www.postmodernchina.org/cgi/aboutUs.html |archive-date=2 December 2013 |website=www.postmodernchina.org |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and books by process philosophers John Cobb and David Ray Griffin are becoming required reading for Chinese graduate students.&lt;ref name="blogs.vancouversun" /&gt; Cobb has attributed China's interest in process philosophy partly to Whitehead's stress on the mutual interdependence of humanity and nature, as well as his emphasis on an educational system that includes the teaching of values rather than simply bare facts.&lt;ref name="blogs.vancouversun" /&gt;

Overall, however, Whitehead's influence is very difficult to characterize.  In English-speaking countries, his primary works are little-studied outside of Claremont and a select number of liberal [[Graduate school|graduate-level]] theology and philosophy programs.  Outside of these circles his influence is relatively small and diffuse, and has tended to come chiefly through the work of his students and admirers rather than Whitehead himself.&lt;ref&gt;"Whitehead, Alfred North", last modified May 8, 2007, Gary L. Herstein, ''[[Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'', accessed July 20, 2015, http://www.iep.utm.edu/whitehed/.&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, Whitehead was a teacher and long-time friend and collaborator of [[Bertrand Russell]], and he also taught and supervised the dissertation of [[Willard Van Orman Quine]],&lt;ref&gt;"Quine Biography", last modified October 2003, John J. O'Connor and [[Edmund F. Robertson]], ''[[MacTutor History of Mathematics archive]]'', [[University of St Andrews]], accessed December 5, 2013, http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Quine.html.&lt;/ref&gt; both of whom are important figures in [[analytic philosophy]] – the dominant strain of philosophy in English-speaking countries in the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Searle]], "Contemporary Philosophy in the United States", in N. Bunnin and E.P. Tsui-James, eds., ''The Blackwell Companion to Philosophy'', 2nd ed., (Oxford: Blackwell, 2003), 1.&lt;/ref&gt;  Whitehead has also had high-profile admirers in the [[Continental philosophy|continental tradition]], such as French [[post-structuralist]] philosopher [[Gilles Deleuze]], who once dryly remarked of Whitehead that "he stands provisionally as the last great Anglo-American philosopher before [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein]]'s disciples spread their misty confusion, sufficiency, and terror."&lt;ref name="GillesDeleuze"&gt;[[Gilles Deleuze]], ''The Fold: Leibniz and the Baroque'', trans. Tom Conley (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1993), 76.&lt;/ref&gt; French [[sociologist]] and [[anthropologist]] [[Bruno Latour]] even went so far as to call Whitehead "the greatest philosopher of the 20th century."&lt;ref name="BrunoLatour"&gt;[[Bruno Latour]], preface to ''Thinking with Whitehead: A Free and Wild Creation of Concepts'', by [[Isabelle Stengers]], trans. Michael Chase (Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press, 2011), x.&lt;/ref&gt;

Deleuze's and Latour's opinions, however, are minority ones, as Whitehead has not been recognized as particularly influential within the most dominant philosophical schools.&lt;ref&gt;"Alfred North Whitehead", last modified March 10, 2015, Andrew David Irvine, ed. Edward N. Zalta, ''[[The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'' (Spring 2015 Edition), accessed July 20, 2015, http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/whitehead/#WI&lt;/ref&gt;  It is impossible to say exactly why Whitehead's influence has not been more widespread, but it may be partly due to his metaphysical ideas seeming somewhat counter-intuitive (such as his assertion that [[matter]] is an [[abstraction]]), or his inclusion of [[theistic]] elements in his philosophy,&lt;ref&gt;"Alfred North Whitehead", last modified October 1, 2013, Andrew David Irvine, ed.

===Process philosophy and theology===
[[Image:Nicholas Rescher 2.jpg|200px|left|thumb|Philosopher [[Nicholas Rescher]]. Rescher is a proponent of both Whiteheadian [[process philosophy]] and American [[pragmatism]].]]
Historically Whitehead's work has been most influential in the field of [[Americans|American]] [[Progressive Christianity|progressive theology]].&lt;ref name="Bruce" /&gt;&lt;ref name="VictorLowe_e" /&gt;  The most important early proponent of Whitehead's thought in a [[theological]] context was [[Charles Hartshorne]], who spent a semester at [[Harvard]] as Whitehead's teaching assistant in 1925, and is widely credited with developing Whitehead's [[process philosophy]] into a full-blown [[process theology]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Hartshorne]], ''A Christian Natural Theology'', 2nd edition (Louisville, Westminster John Knox Press, 2007), 112.&lt;/ref&gt;  Other notable process theologians include [[John B. Cobb]], Jr., [[David Ray Griffin]], [[Marjorie Hewitt Suchocki]], [[C. Robert Mesle]], [[Roland Faber]], and [[Catherine Keller (theologian)|Catherine Keller]].

Process theology typically stresses God's relational nature. Rather than seeing God as [[impassibility|impassive]] or emotionless, process theologians view God as "the fellow sufferer who understands", and as the being who is supremely affected by temporal events.&lt;ref&gt;Alfred North Whitehead, ''Process and Reality'' (New York: The Free Press, 1978), 351.&lt;/ref&gt;  Hartshorne points out that people would not praise a human ruler who was unaffected by either the joys or sorrows of his followers – so why would this be a praise-worthy quality in God?&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Hartshorne]], ''The Divine Relativity: A Social Conception of God'' (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1964), 42–43.&lt;/ref&gt;  Instead, as the being who is most affected by the world, God is the being who can most appropriately respond to the world.  However, process theology has been formulated in a wide variety of ways.  C. Robert Mesle, for instance, advocates a "process naturalism", i.e. a process theology without God.&lt;ref&gt;See part IV of [[C. Robert Mesle|Mesle]]'s ''Process Theology: A Basic Introduction'' (St. Louis: Chalice Press, 1993).&lt;/ref&gt;

In fact, process theology is difficult to define because process theologians are so diverse and [[Transdisciplinarity|transdisciplinary]] in their views and interests. John B. Cobb, Jr. is a process theologian who has also written books on biology and economics. Roland Faber and Catherine Keller integrate Whitehead with [[poststructuralist]], [[postcolonialist]], and [[feminist]] theory. [[Charles Birch]] was both a theologian and a [[geneticist]]. [[Franklin I. Gamwell]] writes on theology and political theory. In ''Syntheism - Creating God in The Internet Age'', futurologists [[Alexander Bard]] and [[Jan Söderqvist]] repeatedly credit Whitehead for the process theology they see rising out of the [[participatory culture]] expected to dominate the digital era.

Process philosophy is even more difficult to pin down than process theology. In practice, the two fields cannot be neatly separated. The 32-volume [[State University of New York]] series in constructive postmodern thought edited by process philosopher and theologian [[David Ray Griffin]] displays the range of areas in which different process philosophers work, including physics, ecology, medicine, public policy, nonviolence, politics, and psychology.&lt;ref&gt;"Search Results For: SUNY series in Constructive Postmodern Thought", Sunypress.edu, accessed December 5, 2013, http://www.sunypress.edu/Searchadv.aspx?IsSubmit=true&amp;CategoryID=6899.&lt;/ref&gt;

One philosophical school which has historically had a close relationship with process philosophy is American [[pragmatism]]. Whitehead himself thought highly of [[William James]] and [[John Dewey]], and acknowledged his indebtedness to them in the preface to ''[[Process and Reality]]''.&lt;ref name="AlfredNorth_f" /&gt;  Charles Hartshorne (along with [[Paul Weiss (philosopher)|Paul Weiss]]) edited the collected papers of [[Charles Sanders Peirce]], one of the founders of pragmatism.  Noted [[neopragmatist]] [[Richard Rorty]] was in turn a student of Hartshorne.&lt;ref&gt;"Richard Rorty", last modified June 16, 2007, Bjørn Ramberg, ed. Edward N. Zalta, ''[[The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'' (Spring 2009 Edition), accessed December 5, 2013, http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2009/entries/rorty/.&lt;/ref&gt;  Today, [[Nicholas Rescher]] is one example of a philosopher who advocates both process philosophy and pragmatism.

In addition, while they might not properly be called process philosophers, Whitehead has been influential in the philosophy of [[Gilles Deleuze]], [[Milič Čapek]], [[Isabelle Stengers]], [[Bruno Latour]], [[Susanne Langer]], and [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]].{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

Scientists of the early 20th century for whom Whitehead's work has been influential include physical chemist [[Ilya Prigogine]], biologist [[Conrad Hal Waddington]], and geneticists [[Charles Birch]] and [[Sewall Wright]].&lt;ref name="Birch"&gt;[[Charles Birch]], "Why Aren't We Zombies? Neo-Darwinism and Process Thought", in ''Back to Darwin: A Richer Account of Evolution'', ed. John B. Cobb, Jr., (Grand Rapids: William B. Eerdmans Publishing Company, 2008), 252.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Henry Murray]] dedicated his "Explorations in Personality" to Whitehead, a contemporary at Harvard.

In physics, [[Whitehead's theory of gravitation]] articulated a view that might perhaps be regarded as dual to [[Einstein]]'s [[general relativity]]. It has been severely criticized.&lt;ref&gt;[[Subramanyan Chandrasekhar|Chandrasekhar, S.]] (1979). Einstein and general relativity, ''Am. J. Phys.'' '''47''': 212–217.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Clifford Martin Will|Will, C.M.]] (1981/1993). ''Theory and Experiment in Gravitational Physics'', revised edition, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge UK, {{isbn|978-0-521-43973-2}}, p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt; Yutaka Tanaka suggested that the [[gravitational constant]] disagrees with experimental findings, and proposed that Einstein's work does not actually refute Whitehead's formulation.&lt;ref&gt;Yutaka Tanaka, "The Comparison between Whitehead's and Einstein's Theories of Relativity", ''Historia Scientiarum'' 32 (1987).&lt;/ref&gt;  Whitehead's view has now been rendered obsolete, with the discovery of [[gravitational waves]], phenomena observed locally that largely violate the kind of local flatness of space that Whitehead assumes. Consequently, Whitehead's cosmology must be regarded as a local approximation, and his assumption of a uniform spatio-temporal geometry, Minkowskian in particular, as an often-locally-adequate approximation. An exact replacement of Whitehead's cosmology would need to admit a Riemannian geometry. Also, although Whitehead himself gave only secondary consideration to [[quantum mechanics|quantum theory]], his [[metaphysics]] of processes has proved attractive to some physicists in that field. [[Henry Stapp]] and [[David Bohm]] are among those whose work has been influenced by Whitehead.&lt;ref name="SeeDavid" /&gt;

In the 21 st century, Whiteheadian thought is still a stimulating influence: [[Timothy E. Eastman]] and Hank Keeton's ''Physics and Whitehead'' (2004)&lt;ref&gt;Timothy E. Eastman and Hank Keeton, eds., ''Physics and Whitehead: Quantum, Process, and Experience'' (Albany: State University of New York Press, 2004).&lt;/ref&gt; and Michael Epperson's ''Quantum Mechanics and the Philosophy of Alfred North Whitehead'' (2004)&lt;ref&gt;Michael Epperson, ''Quantum Mechanics and the Philosophy of Alfred North Whitehead'' (New York: Fordham University Press, 2004).&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Foundations of Relational Realism: A Topological Approach to Quantum Mechanics and the Philosophy of Nature'' (2013),&lt;ref&gt;Michael Epperson &amp; Elias Zafiris, ''Foundations of Relational Realism: A Topological Approach to Quantum Mechanics and the Philosophy of Nature'' (New York: Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt; aim to offer Whiteheadian approaches to [[physics]]. Brian G. Henning, Adam Scarfe, and [[Dorion Sagan]]'s ''Beyond Mechanism'' (2013) and [[Rupert Sheldrake]]'s ''Science Set Free'' (2012) are examples of Whiteheadian approaches to biology.

===Ecology, economy, and sustainability===
[[Image:John B. Cobb Jr.jpg|250px|left|thumb|Theologian, philosopher, and environmentalist [[John B. Cobb, Jr.]] founded the [[Center for Process Studies]] in [[Claremont, California]] with [[David Ray Griffin]] in 1973, and is often regarded as the preeminent scholar in the field of [[process philosophy]] and [[process theology]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Roland Faber]], ''God as Poet of the World: Exploring Process Theologies'' (Louisville: Westminster John Knox Press, 2008), 35.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[C. Robert Mesle]], ''Process Theology'' (St. Louis: Chalice Press, 1993), 126.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Gary Dorrien]], "The Lure and Necessity of Process Theology", ''CrossCurrents'' 58 (2008): 316.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Monica Coleman]], [[Nancy R. Howell]], and Helene Tallon Russell, ''Creating Women's Theology: A Movement Engaging Process Thought'' (Wipf and Stock, 2011), 13.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
One of the most promising applications of Whitehead's thought in recent years has been in the area of [[ecology|ecological]] civilization, [[sustainability]], and [[environmental ethics]].

"Because Whitehead's holistic [[metaphysics]] of value lends itself so readily to an ecological point of view, many see his work as a promising alternative to the traditional [[Mechanism (philosophy)|mechanistic]] worldview, providing a detailed metaphysical picture of a world constituted by a web of interdependent relations."&lt;ref name="PhilipRose" /&gt;

This work has been pioneered by [[John B. Cobb]], Jr., whose book ''Is It Too Late? A Theology of Ecology'' (1971) was the first single-authored book in environmental ethics.&lt;ref&gt;"History of Environmental Ethics for the Novice", last modified March 15, 2011, The Center for Environmental Philosophy, accessed November 21, 2013, http://www.cep.unt.edu/novice.html.&lt;/ref&gt;  Cobb also co-authored a book with leading [[Ecological economics|ecological economist]] and [[Steady-state economy#Herman Daly's concept of a steady-state economy|steady-state theorist]] [[Herman Daly]] entitled ''For the Common Good: Redirecting the Economy toward Community, the Environment, and a Sustainable Future'' (1989), which applied Whitehead's thought to [[economics]], and received the [[Grawemeyer Award]] for Ideas Improving World Order. Cobb followed this with a second book, ''Sustaining the Common Good: A Christian Perspective on the Global Economy'' (1994), which aimed to challenge "economists' zealous faith in the great god of growth."&lt;ref&gt;John B. Cobb, Jr., ''Sustaining the Common Good: A Christian Perspective on the Global Economy'' (Cleveland: The Pilgrim Press, 1994), back cover.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education===
Whitehead is widely known for his influence in [[education theory]]. His philosophy inspired the formation of the Association for Process Philosophy of Education (APPE), which published eleven volumes of a journal titled ''Process Papers'' on [[process philosophy]] and education from 1996 to 2008.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Process Papers'', a publication of the Association for Process Philosophy of Education.  Volume 1 published in 1996, Volume 11 (final volume) published in 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  Whitehead's theories on education also led to the formation of new modes of learning and new models of teaching.

One such model is the ANISA model developed by Daniel C. Jordan, which sought to address a lack of understanding of the nature of people in current education systems.  As Jordan and Raymond P. Shepard put it: "Because it has not defined the nature of man, education is in the untenable position of having to devote its energies to the development of curricula without any coherent ideas about the nature of the creature for whom they are intended."&lt;ref&gt;Daniel C. Jordan and Raymond P. Shepard, "The Philosophy of the ANISA Model", ''Process Papers'' 6, 38–39.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another model is the FEELS model developed by Xie Bangxiu and deployed successfully in China. "FEELS" stands for five things in curriculum and education: Flexible-goals, Engaged-learner, Embodied-knowledge, Learning-through-interactions, and Supportive-teacher.&lt;ref&gt;"FEELS: A Constructive Postmodern Approach To Curriculum and Education", Xie Bangxiu, JesusJazzBuddhism.org, accessed December 5, 2013, http://www.jesusjazzbuddhism.org/feels.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102202438/http://www.jesusjazzbuddhism.org/feels.html |date=2 November 2013 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is used for understanding and evaluating educational curriculum under the assumption that the purpose of education is to "help a person become whole." This work is in part the product of cooperation between Chinese government organizations and the Institute for the Postmodern Development of China.&lt;ref name="blogs.vancouversun" /&gt;

Whitehead's philosophy of education has also found institutional support in Canada, where the [[University of Saskatchewan]] created a Process Philosophy Research Unit and sponsored several conferences on process philosophy and education.&lt;ref&gt;"International Conferences – University of Saskatchewan", University of Saskatchewan, accessed December 5, 2013, https://www.usask.ca/usppru/international-conferences.php.&lt;/ref&gt;  Dr. Howard Woodhouse at the University of Saskatchewan remains a strong proponent of Whiteheadian education.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usask.ca/education/profiles/woodhouse/index.php "Dr. Howard Woodhouse"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160507014657/http://www.usask.ca/education/profiles/woodhouse/index.php |date=7 May 2016 }}, University of Saskatchewan, accessed December 5, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Three recent books which further develop Whitehead's philosophy of education include: ''Modes of Learning: Whitehead's Metaphysics and the Stages of Education'' (2012) by George Allan; and ''The Adventure of Education: Process Philosophers on Learning, Teaching, and Research'' (2009) by Adam Scarfe, and "Educating for an Ecological Civilization: Interdisciplinary, Experiential, and Relational Learning" (2017) edited by Marcus Ford and Stephen Rowe. "Beyond the Modern University: Toward a Constructive Postmodern University," (2002) is another text that explores the importance of Whitehead's metaphysics for thinking about higher education.

===Business administration===
Whitehead has had some influence on philosophy of [[business administration]] and [[organizational theory]].  This has led in part to a focus on identifying and investigating the effect of temporal events (as opposed to static things) within organizations through an “organization studies” discourse that accommodates a variety of 'weak' and 'strong' process perspectives from a number of philosophers.&lt;ref&gt;Tor Hernes, ''A Process Theory of Organization'' (Oxford University Press, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;  One of the leading figures having an explicitly Whiteheadian and [[Panpsychism#Panexperientialism|panexperientialist]] stance towards [[management]] is Mark Dibben,&lt;ref&gt;Mark R. Dibben and [[John B. Cobb, Jr.]], "Special Focus: Process Thought and Organization Studies," in ''Process Studies 32'' (2003).&lt;/ref&gt; who works in what he calls "applied process thought" to articulate a philosophy of management and business administration as part of a wider examination of the [[social science]]s through the lens of [[Process philosophy|process metaphysics]]. For Dibben, this allows "a comprehensive exploration of life as perpetually active experiencing, as opposed to occasional – and thoroughly passive – happening."&lt;ref&gt;"Mark Dibben – School of Management – University of Tasmania, Australia", last modified July 16, 2013, University of Tasmania, accessed November 21, 2013, http://www.utas.edu.au/business-and-economics/people/profiles/accounting/Mark-Dibben.&lt;/ref&gt;  Dibben has published two books on applied process thought, ''[https://www.academia.edu/6359574/Mark_Dibben_and_Thomas_Kelly_eds._Applied_Process_Thought_I_Initial_Explorations_in_Theory_and_Research_2008 Applied Process Thought I: Initial Explorations in Theory and Research]'' (2008), and ''[https://www.academia.edu/6359614/Mark_Dibben_and_Rebecca_Newton_eds._Applied_Process_Thought_II_Following_a_Trail_Ablaze_2009 Applied Process Thought II: Following a Trail Ablaze]'' (2009), as well as other papers in this vein in the fields of philosophy of management and [[business ethics]].&lt;ref&gt;Mark Dibben, "Exploring the Processual Nature of Trust and Cooperation in Organisations: A Whiteheadian Analysis," in ''[[Philosophy of Management]] 4'' (2004): 25-39; Mark Dibben, "Organisations and Organising: Understanding and Applying Whitehead’s Processual Account," in ''[[Philosophy of Management]] 7'' (2009); Cristina Neesham and Mark Dibben, "The Social Value of Business: Lessons from Political Economy and Process Philosophy," in ''Applied Ethics: Remembering Patrick Primeaux'' (Research in Ethical Issues in Organizations, Volume 8), ed. Michael Schwartz and Howard Harris (Emerald Group Publishing Limited, 2012): 63-83.&lt;/ref&gt;

Margaret Stout and Carrie M. Staton have also written recently on the mutual influence of Whitehead and [[Mary Parker Follett]], a pioneer in the fields of organizational theory and [[organizational behavior]].  Stout and Staton see both Whitehead and Follett as sharing an [[ontology]] that "understands becoming as a relational process; difference as being related, yet unique; and the purpose of becoming as harmonizing difference."&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Stout &amp; Carrie M. Staton, "The Ontology of Process Philosophy in Follett's Administrative Theory" ''Administrative Theory &amp; Praxis'' 33 (2011): 268.&lt;/ref&gt; This connection is further analyzed by Stout and Jeannine M. Love in ''Integrative Process: Follettian Thinking from Ontology to Administration''&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Stout &amp; Jeannine M. Love, ''Integrative Process: Follettian Thinking from Ontology to Administration'', (Anoka, MN: Process Century Press 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Political views ===
Whitehead's political views sometimes appear to be [[Libertarian]] without the label. He wrote:{{cquote|Now the intercourse between individuals and between social groups takes one of two forms, force or persuasion. [[Commerce]] is the great example of intercourse by way of persuasion. [[War]], [[slavery]], and governmental compulsion exemplify the reign of force.&lt;ref&gt;''Adventures of Ideas'' p. 105, 1933 edition; p. 83, 1967 ed.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
On the other hand, many Whitehead scholars read his work as providing a philosophical foundation for the social liberalism of the [[Social liberalism|New Liberal]] movement that was prominent throughout Whitehead's adult life. Morris wrote that "...there is good reason for claiming that Whitehead shared the social and political ideals of the new liberals."&lt;ref&gt;Morris, Randall C., ''Journal of the History of Ideas'' 51: 75-92. p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alison Simmons ''' (born 1965) the Samuel H. Wolcott Professor of Philosophy and [[Harvard College]] Professor at Harvard University.&lt;ref name = "Faculty page"&gt;{{cite web|title=Harvard Faculty page|url=http://philosophy.fas.harvard.edu/people/people-terms/department-faculty?page=1|work=Harvard University|accessdate=10 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Harvard College Professor"&gt;{{cite web|last=Simmons|first=Alison|title=Harvard College Professor |url=http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2011/05/harvard-college-professorships-for-five/|accessdate= 22 July 2013|date=2011-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her primary scholarly interests are in early modern theories of mind (17th-18th century), the relationship between [[mind]] and [[Human body|body]], and sensory perception.

Simmons studied psychology as an undergraduate at [[Bucknell University]], graduating [[summa cum laude]] with highest honors in psychology in 1987.  She initially attended [[Cornell University]] as a graduate student, studying cognitive and perceptual psychology with Elizabeth Spelke.  She transferred a year later to the [[University of Pennsylvania]] to study philosophy under the direction of Gary Hatfield. She received her Ph.D. in philosophy from Penn in 1994 and took her first academic job as Assistant Professor at Harvard University.  She was promoted to John L. Loeb Associate Professor of Philosophy in 1999. In 2002, she became the first woman to be tenured from a junior faculty position within Harvard’s philosophy department.  (Gisela Striker is the first woman to have a tenured position in the department, in 1989.)  In 2008 Simmons was named the Samuel H. Wolcott Professor of Philosophy, and in 2011 she was named a Harvard College Professor.

As a graduate student, Simmons held fellowships from the [[National Science Foundation]] and the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]].  She was named a Dean’s Scholar in 1993.  At Harvard, she has been awarded a John L. Loeb Associate Professorship, the inaugural Samuel H. Wolcott Professorship, and a five-year Harvard College Professorship.  Her article, “Changing the Cartesian Mind” was selected for Philosopher’s Annual in 2001. Simmons' work on Descartes has been particularly influential, and she additionally serves as a jury member for the million-dollar [[The Berggruen Prize|Berggruen Prize]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://blog.apaonline.org/2016/10/14/ideasmatter-interview-with-nicolas-berggruen/|title=#IdeasMatter: Interview with Nicolas Berggruen|date=2016-10-14|work=Blog of the APA|access-date=2017-11-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dailynous.com/2017/10/04/onora-oneill-wins-1-million-berggruen-prize/|title=Onora O'Neill Wins $1 Million Berggruen Prize - Daily Nous|website=dailynous.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-14|date=2017-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Teleological Account"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Springer Link|journal=Synthese|volume=156|issue=2|pages=311–336|doi=10.1007/s11229-006-0010-4|year=2007|last1=Rosa|first1=Raffaella De}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ananda Yoga''', or ''Ananda Yoga for Higher Awareness''&lt;ref&gt;Ananda Yoga for Higher Awareness
By Swami Kriyananda, J Donald Walters
Published by Crystal Clarity Publishers, 1997
{{ISBN|1-56589-078-7}}, {{ISBN|978-1-56589-078-7}}
159 pages&lt;/ref&gt; is a system of [[Hatha Yoga]] established by [[Kriyananda]], a disciple of [[Paramahansa Yogananda]], and is based on Yogananda's [[Self-Realization Fellowship]] (SRF) and [[Yogoda Satsanga Society of India]] (YSS) teachings. Ananda Yoga emphasizes inner awareness; energy control; and the experience of each asana as a natural expression of a higher state of consciousness, which is enhanced by the use of affirmations.

== History ==
Ananda Yoga was established by Kriyananda taking from one of the oldest Hatha Yoga systems in the West. Its roots are the 1940s/1950s, when Kriyananda was with Self-Realization Fellowship, he was taught these postures by Yogananda.  Yogananda, founder of SRF and YSS,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Melton, J. Gordon|first=Martin Baumann|title=Religions of the World: A Comprehensive Encyclopedia of Beliefs and Practices |year=2010|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=9781598842043 }}&lt;/ref&gt; asked Kriyananda (then Donald Walters) and other young monks, to demonstrate the postures for visiting guests, as well as for public events, such as the SRF "Lake Shrine Dedication." Kriyananda and other monks also posed for photos, for articles on the yoga postures in Yogananda's "Self-Realization Magazine."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ananda.org/inspiration/books/path/index.html Described in "The New Path" by Swami Kriyananda, Crystal Clarity Publishers]&lt;/ref&gt; From 1965 Kriyananda through his own organization started to teach Ananda Yoga publicly in California. The director of Ananda Yoga, Gyandev Rich McCord,  is a co-founder of [[Yoga Alliance]] and a member of its board of directors.&lt;ref&gt;To hear Gyandev's keynote address, “Future Directions for Yoga in the West”, at the 2011 Yoga Alliance Leadership Conference: http://vimeo.com/31819734&lt;/ref&gt;

== Principles ==
Ananda Yoga uses [[asana]] and [[pranayama]] to awaken, experience, and control the subtle energies (prana) within oneself, especially the energies of the chakras. Its object is to use those energies to harmonize the body, uplift the mind, and above all to attune oneself with higher levels of awareness. One unique feature of this system is the use of silent affirmations while in the asanas, as a means of working more consciously with the subtle energies to achieve this attunement. Ananda Yoga is a relatively inward experience, not an athletic practice. A main goal is to prepare for deep meditation, as Hatha Yoga is considered the physical branch of [[Raja Yoga]].&lt;ref&gt;Hatha Yoga was classically a staircase to Raja Yoga: see the [[Hatha Yoga Pradipika]] and [[Gherand Samhita]], their very first sentences.&lt;/ref&gt;
Ananda Yoga also includes Paramahansa Yogananda's SRF Energization Exercises, which direct cosmic life force (prana) through the medulla oblongata to all parts of the body.

== Energization exercises ==
The "Energization Exercises", a vital part of Ananda Yoga, are Yogananda's contribution to the science of yoga. He first developed them in 1916, within his organization then called "Yogoda," which he changed to [[Self-Realization Fellowship]] / [[Yogoda Satsanga Society of India]] in the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kress |first=Michael |title=Publishers Weekly: Meditation is the message |year=2001 |publisher=Cahners Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier, Inc.|location= New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; He eventually expanded them into a set of 39 exercises. The goal is to tap into cosmic energy, recharging the whole body. Yogananda explains in his ''[[Autobiography of a Yogi]]'': "Realizing that man’s body is like an electric battery, I reasoned that it could be recharged with energy through the direct agency of the human will…. I therefore taught the Ranchi students my simple “Yogoda” techniques by which the life force, centered in man’s medulla oblongata, can be consciously and instantly recharged from the unlimited supply of cosmic energy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Yogananda |first=Paramahansa |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Autobiography of a Yogi |year=1997 |publisher=Self-Realization Fellowship |location= Los Angeles, CA|isbn=0-87612-086-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Anthology of the Patriarchal Hall''''' ({{CJKV|c=祖堂集|p=Zǔtángjí|j=Sodōshū}}) is a [[Chinese language|Chinese]] text compiled by two Chinese Buddhist monks in 952 during the [[Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period]]. It is the oldest existing collection of [[Chan Buddhism|Chan (or Zen)]] [[koan|encounter dialogues]], dating from about half a century before the much more well known ''[[Transmission of the Lamp]]''. After being lost for centuries, it was rediscovered by Japanese scholars in the 20th century at the [[Haeinsa]] temple in [[Korea]], in a complete form with all twenty chapters. The text survived in the form of printing plates made during the 13th century, and not as a printed book. Much like other Chan Buddhist texts, it is written in the form of daily conversations between masters and students or between students themselves.

The ''Anthology'' is particularly important for the study of the [[History of the Chinese language|history of Chinese]], as it contains what is believed to be a good record of what vernacular northern Chinese speech was like in the 10th century. An example of a grammatical phenomenon in the text is the use of 也 ''yě'' as a marker of the [[Perfect (grammar)|perfect]], showing a coalescence of the Classical Chinese particles 也 ''yě'' and 矣 ''yǐ''.

{{redirect|Scylla and Charybdis}}
[[Image:Johann Heinrich Füssli 054.jpg|thumb|[[Henry Fuseli]]'s painting of Odysseus facing the choice between Scylla and Charybdis, 1794/6]]
Being '''between Scylla and Charybdis''' is an idiom deriving from Greek mythology, meaning "having to choose between two evils". Several other idioms, such as "on the horns of a dilemma", "[[between the devil and the deep blue sea]]", and "[[between a rock and a hard place]]" express similar  meanings.

==The myth and the proverb==
[[Scylla]] and [[Charybdis]] were mythical [[sea monsters]] noted by [[Homer]]; Greek mythology sited them on opposite sides of the [[Strait of Messina]] between [[Sicily]] and the Italian mainland. Scylla was rationalized as a rock [[shoal]] (described as a six-headed sea monster) on the Italian side of the strait and Charybdis was a [[whirlpool]] off the coast of Sicily. They were regarded as maritime hazards located close enough to each other that they posed an inescapable threat to passing sailors; avoiding Charybdis meant passing too close to Scylla and vice versa. According to Homer, [[Odysseus]] was forced to choose which monster to confront while passing through the strait; he opted to pass by Scylla and lose only a few sailors, rather than risk the loss of his entire ship in the whirlpool.

Because of such stories, having to navigate between the two hazards eventually entered idiomatic use.  Another equivalent English seafaring phrase is, "Between a rock and a hard place".&lt;ref&gt;Definition from the ''Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English'' [http://www.ldoceonline.com/dictionary/Scylla-and-Charybdis available online]&lt;/ref&gt; The Latin line ''incidit in scyllam cupiens vitare charybdim'' (he runs into Scylla, wishing to avoid Charybdis) had earlier become proverbial, with a meaning much the same as [[jumping from the frying pan into the fire]]. [[Erasmus]] recorded it as an ancient proverb in his ''[[Adagia]]'', although the earliest known instance is in the ''[[Alexandreis]]'', a 12th-century Latin [[epic poetry|epic poem]] by [[Walter of Châtillon]].&lt;ref&gt;Noted by [[Edward Charles Harington]] in [https://books.google.com/books?id=7mIEAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA10 ''Notes and Queries'' 5th Series, '''8''' (7 July 1877:14)].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural and popular references==
The myth was given an allegorical interpretation by the French poet [[Barthélemy Aneau]] in his [[emblem book]] ''Picta Poesis'' (1552). There one is advised to choose the risk of being envied for wealth or reputation rather than swallowed by the Charybdis of poverty. "Choose the lesser of these evils. A wise man would rather be envied than miserable."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emblems.arts.gla.ac.uk/french/emblem.php?id=FANa072 French Emblems at Glasgow]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:GillrayBritannia.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.2|[[James Gillray]], ''Britannia between Scylla and Charybdis'' (1793)]]
The story was often applied to political situations at a later date. In [[James Gillray]]'s cartoon, ''Britannia between Scylla and Charybdis'' (3 June 1793),&lt;ref&gt;Published by H. Humphrey, London 8 April 1793&lt;/ref&gt; '[[William Pitt the Younger|William Pitt]] helms the ship ''Constitution'', containing an alarmed Britannia, between the rock of democracy (with the liberty cap on its summit) and the whirlpool of arbitrary power (in the shape of an inverted crown), to the distant haven of liberty'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Iain |last=Hampsher-Monk |title=The Impact of the French Revolution |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2005 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8qWwQqPeqBQC&amp;dq=%22%27William+Pitt+helms+the+ship+Constitution%2C+containing+an+alarmed+Britannia%2C+between+the+rock+of+democracy+%28with+the+liberty+cap+on+its+summit%29+and+the+whirlpool+of+arbitrary+power+%28in+the+shape+of+an+inverted+crown%29%2C+to+the+distant+haven+of+liberty%22&amp;q=Scylla#v=snippet&amp;q=Scylla&amp;f=false |isbn=0-521-57005-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was in the context of the effect of the [[French Revolution]] on politics in Britain. That the dilemma had still to be resolved in the aftermath of the revolution is suggested by [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]]'s returning to the idiom in his 1820 essay ''[[A Defence of Poetry]]'': "The rich have become richer, and the poor have become poorer; and the vessel of the state is driven between the Scylla and Charybdis of anarchy and despotism."&lt;ref&gt;The Harvard Classics, section 33; [http://www.bartleby.com/27/23.html available online]&lt;/ref&gt;

A later ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' caricature by [[John Tenniel]], dated 10 October 1863, pictures the [[Prime Minister]] [[Henry John Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston|Lord Palmerston]] carefully steering the British ship of state between the perils of Scylla, a craggy rock in the form of a grim-visaged [[Abraham Lincoln]], and Charybdis, a whirlpool which foams and froths into a likeness of [[Jefferson Davis]]. A shield emblazoned "Neutrality" hangs on the ship's thwarts, referring to how Palmerston tried to maintain a strict impartiality towards both combatants in the [[American Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abrahamlincolncartoons.info/SubPages/Cartoon.php?UniqueID=415 View online]&lt;/ref&gt; American satirical magazine ''[[Puck (magazine)|Puck]]'' also used the myth in a caricature by F. Graetz, dated November 26, 1884, in which the unmarried President-elect [[Grover Cleveland]] rows desperately between snarling monsters captioned "Mother-in-law" and "Office Seekers".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historyonthenet.com/authentichistory/1865-1897/3-gilded/4-cleveland1 Scroll down on History on the Net]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Victor Hugo]] uses the equivalent French idiom (''tomber de Charybde en Scylla'') in his novel ''[[Les Miserables]]'' (1862), again in a political context, as a metaphor for the staging of two rebel barricades during the climactic uprising in Paris, around which the final events of the book culminate. The first chapter of the final volume is entitled "The Charybdis of the Faubourg Saint Antoine and the Scylla of the Faubourg du Temple".

By the time of [[Nicholas Monsarrat]]'s 1951 war novel, ''[[The Cruel Sea (novel)|The Cruel Sea]]'', however, the upper-class junior officer, Morell, is teased by his middle-class peer, Lockhart, for using such an old-fashioned phrase. Nevertheless, the idiom has since taken on new life in pop lyrics. In [[The Police]]'s 1983 single "[[Wrapped Around Your Finger]]", the second line uses it as a metaphor for being in a dangerous relationship; this is reinforced by a later mention of the similar idiom of "the devil and the deep blue sea".&lt;ref&gt;The words are [http://www.elyrics.net/read/p/police-lyrics/wrapped-around-your-finger-lyrics.html online]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{youtube|id=Gondjza0sUs}}&lt;/ref&gt; American heavy metal band [[Trivium (band)|Trivium]] also referenced the idiom in "Torn Between Scylla and Charybdis", a track from their 2008 album ''Shogun'', in which the lyrics are about having to choose "between death and doom".&lt;ref&gt;{{youtube|id=9BZByugVukA|title=The song with lyrics}} (words also available online.)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 [[Graham Waterhouse]] composed a [[piano quartet]], ''[[Skylla and Charybdis (Waterhouse)|Skylla and Charybdis]]'', premiered at the [[Gasteig]] in [[Munich]]. According to his programme note, though its four movements "do not refer specifically to the protagonists or to events connected with the famous legend", their dynamic is linked subjectively to  images connected with it "conjoured up in the composer's mind during the writing".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.arbc.de/Waterhouse/werke.htm#skylla Composer's website]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6447">{{Zoroastrianism}}
The ''Book of Ardā Wīrāz'' ([[Middle Persian]] ''Ardā Wīrāz nāmag'', {{IPA|ardaː wiːraːz naːmag}}, sometimes called the "Arda Wiraf") is a [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] religious text of the [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanian]] era written in Middle Persian. It contains about 8,800 words.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.farvardyn.com/pahlavi4.php#57&lt;/ref&gt; It describes the dream-journey of a devout Zoroastrian (the Wīrāz of the story) through the next world. The text assumed its definitive form in the 9th-10th centuries after a long series of emendations.&lt;ref&gt;{{iranica|arda-wiraz-wiraz|Ardā Wīrāz-nāmag}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Title==
The full title is ''Ardā Wīrāz nāmag'', "Book of the Just Wīrāz".

Due to the ambiguity inherent to [[Pahlavi scripts]], ''Wīrāz'', the name of the protagonist, may also be transliterated as ''Wiraf'' or ''Viraf'', but the Avestan form is clearly ''Virāza'', suggesting the correct reading is ''z''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://titus.uni-frankfurt.de/texte/etcs/iran/miran/mpers/arda/arda.htm|title=TITUS Texts: Arda Viraz (Pahlavi): Frame|first=Jost|last=Gippert|date=|website=titus.uni-frankfurt.de}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{iranica|arda-wiraz-wiraz|Ardā Wīrāz}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Ardā'' of the name (cf. [[asha|aša]], cognate with Skt. ''[[ṛta]]'') is an [[epithet]] of Wīrāz and is approximately translatable as "truthful, righteous, just."&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{iranica|ahlaw-ahlav-written-hlwb-a-middle-persian-term-which-plays-a-fundamental-role-in-mazdean-soteriology-and-which-is-usua|ahlaw}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wīrāz is probably akin to [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] *''wiHro-''-, "man", see Skt. ''vīra''.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Finally, ''Nāmag'' means "book".

==Textual History==
The date of the book is not known, but in ''The Sacred Books and Early Literature of the East'', Prof. Charles Horne assumes that it was composed fairly late in the ancient history of Zoroastrianism, probably from the period of the [[Sasanian Empire]] (from [[House of Sasan|224 to 651]]), when Zoroastrianism experienced a state-sponsored revival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/sacredbooksearly07hornuoft|title=The sacred books and early literature of the East; with an historical survey and descriptions|first=Charles Francis|last=Horne|date=|publisher=New York, Parke|via=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most modern scholars simply state that the text's ''terminus ad quem'' was the 10th or 11th century.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

==Plot summary==
Wīrāz is chosen for his piety to undertake a journey to the next world in order to prove the truth of Zoroastrian beliefs, after a period when the land of [[Iran]] had been troubled by the presence of confused and alien religions. He drinks [[wine]] and a [[hallucinogen]], [[soma (drink)|soma]], after which his soul travels to the next world. Here he is greeted by a beautiful woman named [[Daena|Dēn]], who represents his faith and virtue. Crossing the [[Chinvat Bridge]], he is then conducted by "[[Sraosha|Srosh]], the pious and [[Atar|Adar]], the angel" through the "star track", "moon track" and "sun track" &amp;ndash; places outside of heaven reserved for the virtuous who have nevertheless failed to conform to Zoroastrian rules. In heaven, Wīrāz meets [[Ahura Mazda]] who shows him the souls of the blessed (''[[ashavan|ahlaw]]'', an alternate Middle Persian version of the word ''ardā''&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;). Each person is described living an idealised version of the life he or she lived on earth, as a warrior, agriculturalist, shepherd or other profession.&lt;ref name="avesta.org"&gt;http://www.avesta.org/pahlavi/viraf.html Translation of the Book of Arda Viraf&lt;/ref&gt; With his guides he then descends into hell to be shown the sufferings of the wicked. Having completed his visionary journey, Wīrāz is told by [[Ahura Mazda]] that the Zoroastrian faith is the only proper and true way of life and that it should be preserved in both prosperity and adversity.&lt;ref name="avesta.org"/&gt;

==Quotes from the Text==
*They say that, once upon a time, the pious [[Zoroaster|Zartosht]] made the religion, which he had received, current in the world; and till the completion of 300 years, the religion was in purity, and men were without doubts. But afterward, the accursed evil spirit, the wicked one, in order to make men doubtful of this religion, instigated the accursed [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]], the [[Rûm]]an,&lt;ref&gt;Alexander the Great was called "the Roman" in Zoroastrian tradition because he came from Greek provinces which later were a part of the [[Byzantine Empire]] -  The archeology of world religions By Jack Finegan Page 80 {{ISBN|0-415-22155-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; who was dwelling in Egypt, so that he came to the country of Iran with severe cruelty and war and devastation; he also slew the ruler of Iran, and destroyed the metropolis and empire, and made them desolate.&lt;ref name="http://www.avesta.org/mp/viraf.html"&gt;http://www.avesta.org/mp/viraf.html&lt;/ref&gt;
**Introduction
*Then I saw the souls of those whom serpents sting and ever devour their tongues. And I asked thus: 'What [[sin]] was committed by those, whose soul suffers so severe a punishment?' Srosh the pious, and Adar the [[angel]], said, thus: 'These are the souls of those liars and irreverent [or 'untruthful'] speakers who, in the world, spoke much falsehood and lies and profanity.&lt;ref name="http://www.avesta.org/mp/viraf.html"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3608">'''Bracketing''' ({{lang-de|Einklammerung}}; also called '''phenomenological reduction''') is a term in the philosophical movement of [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] describing the act of suspending judgment about the natural world to instead focus on analysis of experience.

==Overview==
Phenomenology, developed by [[Edmund Husserl]] (1859–1938), can be understood as an outgrowth of the influential ideas of [[Immanuel Kant]] (1724-1804). Attempting to resolve some of the key intellectual debates of his era, Kant argued that ''[[Noumenon|Noumena]]'' (fundamentally unknowable things-in-themselves) must be distinguished from ''[[Phenomenon|Phenomena]]'' (the world as it appears to the mind). Kant, commonly misconceived as arguing that humans cannot have direct access to [[Reality#Western philosophy|reality]], but only to the [[Mental content|contents of their minds]], argued rather that what is experienced in the mind is reality. Phenomenology grew out of this conception of phenomena, and studies the meaning of isolated phenomena as directly connected to our minds. According to The Columbia Encyclopedia, "Modern philosophers have used 'phenomenon' to designate what is apprehended before judgment is applied."&lt;ref name="Columbia"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.credoreference.com/entry/columency/phenomenon |title=Phenomenon |publisher=The Columbia Encyclopedia |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may not be possible if observation is [[theory-ladenness|theory laden]].

Bracketing (or ''epoché'') is a preliminary act in the phenomenological analysis, conceived by Husserl as the suspension of the trust in the objectivity of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Farina, Gabriella (2014). [http://www.crossingdialogues.com/Ms-A14-07.pdf Some reflections on the phenomenological method.] ''Dialogues in Philosophy, Mental and Neuro Sciences'', '''7'''(2):50–62.&lt;/ref&gt; It involves setting aside the question of the real existence of a contemplated object, as well as all other questions about the object's physical or objective nature; these questions are left to the [[natural sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/851394087|title=Cartesian Meditations: An Introduction to Phenomenology|last=Husserl|first=Edmund|date=|publisher=Springer Netherlands|year=1977|isbn=9789400999978|location=Dordrecht|pages=20-21|oclc=851394087}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, the act of seeing a horse qualifies as an experience, whether one sees the horse in person, in a dream, or in a hallucination. 'Bracketing' the horse suspends any judgement about the horse as ''noumenon'', and instead analyses the ''phenomenon'' of the horse as constituted in intentional acts.

Bracketing may also be understood in terms of the [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenological]] activity it is supposed to make possible:  the "unpacking" of phenomena, or, in other words, systematically peeling away their symbolic meanings like layers of an onion until only the thing itself as meant and experienced remains. Thus, one's subjective intending of the bracketed phenomenon is examined and analyzed in phenomenological purity.

{{Anthroposophy}}

In the '''[[curriculum]] of the [[Waldorf education|Waldorf schools]]''', much of the education in academic subjects takes place in [[block teaching|blocks]], generally of 3–5 weeks duration. Each pupil generally writes and illustrates a self-created textbook representing the material learned in the block.&lt;ref name="TheAtlantic"&gt;Todd Oppenheimer, ''Schooling the Imagination'', Atlantic Monthly, Sept. 99&lt;/ref&gt; These blocks are supported by on-going classes in subjects such as music, art and crafts, and foreign languages that continue throughout the year.

==Curricular Approach==

''The Encyclopedia of Education'' describes Waldorf education as a type of [[alternative education|alternative school]] that focuses on a unique curricular and instructional approach. Other schools placed in this category by the encyclopedia are: [[Montessori schools]]; [[open classroom|open classroom schools]]; [[multiple intelligence]] schools; [[Paideia]] schools; [[democratic education|free schools]]; [[Summerhill School|Summerhill]] schools; as well as [[Continuous Progress Mathematics|continuous progress schools]] and schools without walls. While each of these schools differ in their educational practice, they are similar in their attention to developing an alternative to [[traditional education|traditional]] approaches to education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Guthrie|first=James W.|title=The Encyclopedia of Education, Second Edition|year=2003|publisher=MacMillan Reference USA|location=New York|isbn=0028656024|page=83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a Waldorf elementary school, the curriculum is presented through extended "main lessons" which focus on one subject in depth. This approach differs from other instructional approaches that allot [[period (school)|equal time to every subject]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Unger|first=Harlow G.|title=Encyclopedia of American Education: A to E Vol. 1|year=2007|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=0816043442|page=1197}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In a Waldorf elementary school, the approximately two-hour-long main lesson "ties one topic to as many disciplines as possible".&lt;ref name="unger"&gt;unger&lt;/ref&gt; The main lesson is not taught from a textbook. The teacher will draw a colored chalk drawing on the board to introduce the theme or subject. The structure of the lesson will include activities that "call upon the child's powers of listening, of body movement, of thinking, and of feeling."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Richards|first=MC|title=Towards Wholeness: Rudolf Steiner Education in America|year=1980|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|location=Middletown, CT|isbn=0819560626|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; These activities could include mental math, hand clapping games and jumping rope, folk dances, poetry recitation, singing, and writing and drawing in unlined "main lesson books". Teachers are free to include whatever activities they feel will work best for the children in the class.&lt;ref&gt;richards&lt;/ref&gt;

In high school, students are taught by subject specialists rather than a class teacher. However, the "main lesson" structure remains. The entire curriculum, which is often discussed as an ascending spiral - or "spiral curriculum" - has been described in the following way

:The year progresses with an in-depth study of, say, mathematics, tying it peripherally each day to allied topics- physics, chemistry, home economics and consumerism – each of which is studied separately in shorter classes later in the day. After a few weeks, one of the peripheral topics becomes the main topic…The result is that all subjects are studied in relation to all other subjects. Students learn what historic events were occurring as Shakespeare wrote ''Hamlet'', what music Newton might have listened to as he made his discoveries…&lt;ref name="unger"/&gt;

The presentation of different subjects may be as follows:

==Language, literature, and history==

In Waldorf education writing and reading are introduced at age six or seven; Beginning with oral storytelling, a Waldorf child listens to and summarizes oral language. Then, using imaginative pictures of sounds (e.g. a snake shape for the letter "s"), the children gradually learn the abstract letter forms, and move on to phonetics, spelling, grammar and punctuation.The literary themes of the first through fourth grades are: [[fairy tales]], [[fables]] and [[saints]] stories, [[Old Testament|Hebrew Testament]], and [[Norse mythology]]. Fifth grade includes a survey of Classical [[Hindu mythology|Hindu]], [[Persian mythology|Persian]], [[Egyptian mythology|Egyptian]], and [[Greek mythology|Greek]] mythology, as well as the beginnings of Greek history.

In the middle school years, the literary themes are drawn from history. Sixth grade includes [[Roman history]], seventh grade, the history of the [[Medieval history|Medieval]] period, [[Renaissance]], and [[Reformation]], as well as the voyages of world discovery, and eighth grade focuses on the eighteenth to twentieth centuries, including the major revolutionary movements.

After recording their own stories and illustrations in personal books, children learn to read from the words they wrote themselves. From fourth grade on, creative writing focuses on descriptive writing, poetry, and, in the middle school, themes such as wish, wonder, and surprise. In secondary school, courses examine the development of drama, poetry, and the novel. The secondary curriculum generally includes intensive courses focusing on the works of [[Shakespeare]], [[Dante]]'s [[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]], the [[Parsifal]] saga, [[Goethe]]'s [[Goethe's Faust|Faust]], and the [[American transcendentalism|American transcendentalists]].&lt;ref name="RR" /&gt;&lt;ref name="England"&gt;Woods, Ashley and Woods, [http://www.dfes.gov.uk/research/data/uploadfiles/RR645.pdf ''Steiner Schools in England'', University of West of England, Bristol: Research Report RR645], section 5.2, "Curriculum"&lt;/ref&gt;

The middle school curriculum examines local history, building from studies of traditional life in the immediate environment in fourth grade up through successively larger areas (the locality, country, continent). The  high school history curriculum includes courses on early civilizations, medieval culture, and modern history, as well as specialized courses in the history of the country in which the school is located.&lt;ref name="RR" /&gt;

==Mathematics==

Formal instruction in numeracy begins at age 6/7 with the four primary operations of arithmetic. Fractions are introduced at age 9/10, decimal numbers and proportions at age 10/11, percentages and rates of interest at age 11/12, [[algebra]] at age 12/13. At the secondary level, topics include algebra, [[geometry]], [[conic sections|conics]], [[trigonometry]], [[probability]], [[combinatorics]] and [[calculus]]. [[Descriptive geometry]] and [[projective geometry]] are introduced at age 15/16 and 16/17, respectively.&lt;ref name=RR&gt;''The Educational Tasks and Content of the Steiner Waldorf Curriculum'', Edited by Martyn Rawson and Tobias Richter, [[Steiner Waldorf Schools Fellowship]] 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nature and science==
[[File:Johann Wolfgang Goethe 1811.jpg|right|thumb|[[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]]'s approach to nature influences Waldorf schools' teaching of science.]]
Life sciences begin from age 6 or 7 with stories of "the living world."&lt;ref name=RR/&gt; Observation and description of "the living world" begins at age 9 or 10.&lt;ref name="England"/&gt; The curriculum includes lesson blocks on [[farming]] (age 9 or 10), [[animal]]s (age 10 or 11), [[plants]] (age 11 or 12), as well as [[geology]], [[human biology]] and [[astronomy]] (age 12 or 13).&lt;ref name="England"/&gt;

At secondary school, Waldorf schools study the historical origins, cultural background, and philosophical roots and consequences of scientific discoveries. Educational scholar Bo Dahlin describes the Waldorf approach to science education as follows: 
{{blockquote|Teaching about any natural phenomenon [begins] with pure observations, for instance of an experiment such as the refraction of light in passing a prism, consciously holding back any theorizing about it. This is followed by as careful as possible reconstructing or recollecting the observed phenomena without them being physically present, followed
by—on the following day—the conceptualization of that which was observed. Attentive dwelling on the observations of the senses enhances the potential of immediate experience to break through the armour of preformed conceptions or ready-made thoughts. The recollection of the observations made earlier stimulates penetration of what was experienced by active thinking. |Dahlin, "On the Path Towards Thinking: Learning from Martin Heidegger and Rudolf Steiner"&lt;ref name=Onthepath/&gt;}}

The pedagogy is influenced by [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]]'s phenomenological approach, whereby Nature is conceived as a meaningful whole from which human beings are not alienated. It emphasizes letting the "phenomena themselves speak", using both a genetic method that starts with personal knowledge, out of which conceptual understanding is developed, and an exemplary method that focuses on in-depth investigation of key examples. Dahlin describes the process as "aesthetically rich knowledge formation"&lt;ref name=SSE&gt;{{cite journal|last=Østergaard|first=Edvin|author2=Dahlin, Bo |author3=Hugo, Aksel |title=Doing phenomenology in science education: a research review|journal=Studies in Science Education|date=1 September 2008|volume=44|issue=2|pages=93–121|doi=10.1080/03057260802264081}}&lt;/ref&gt; which "allows the children’s judgement to mature without 'jumping to conclusions'" and "teaches openmindedness, flexibility, truthfulness, and exactitude in dealing with phenomena of nature."&lt;ref name=Onthepath&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dahlin|first=Bo|title=On the Path Towards Thinking: Learning from Martin Heidegger and Rudolf Steiner|journal=Studies in Philosophy and Education|date=November 2009|volume=28|issue=6|pages=537–554|doi=10.1007/s11217-009-9147-1}} Citations that appeared in-line in the original text have not been reproduced here.&lt;/ref&gt;
	 
According to a 2009 European [[PISA]] study, Waldorf pupils' ability in science was "far above average" &lt;!--"Dieses Ergebnis passt zum Befund einer Pisa-STudie, nach der Waldorfschüler weit überdurchschnittliche naturwissenschaftliche Kompetenz aufzuweisen haben" --&gt; in the data set used.&lt;ref name=Jimenez&gt;Fanny Jiménez, [https://www.welt.de/print/die_welt/wissen/article109490665/Wissenschaftler-loben-Waldorfschulen.html  "Wissenschaftler loben Waldorfschulen"], ''Die Welt'', 27 September 2012&lt;/ref&gt; A 2007 German study found that an above-average number of Waldorf students become teachers, doctors, engineers, scholars of the humanities, and scientists.&lt;ref name=Jimenez/&gt; A 2003 evaluation by education scholars David Jelinek and Li-Ling Sun compared a group of American Waldorf school students to American public school students on three different test variables.&lt;ref name=SSE/&gt; Two tests measured verbal and non-verbal logical reasoning and the third was an international [[Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study|TIMMS]] test. The TIMMS test covered scientific understanding of [[magnetism]]. The researchers found that Waldorf school students scored higher than both the public school students (and the national average) on the TIMMS test while scoring the same as the public school students on the logical reasoning tests.&lt;ref name=SSE/&gt; However, when the logical reasoning tests measured students' understanding of part-to-whole relations, the Waldorf students also outperformed the public school students.&lt;ref name="SSE"/&gt; Although the study noted the Waldorf students' enthusiasm for science, the science curriculum itself was viewed as "somewhat old-fashioned and out of date, as well as including some doubtful scientific material."&lt;ref name=SSE/&gt; Educational researchers Phillip and Glenys Woods (2008), who also reviewed this study, criticize the conclusions about the science curriculum because it means the authors have posed an "unresolved conflict" whereby inaccurate science can lead to better science understanding.&lt;ref name=alt_woods&gt;{{cite book|last=Woods|first=Philip A.|title=Alternative Education for the 21st Century Philosophies, Approaches, Visions|year=2008|publisher=Palgrave|isbn=978-0-230-60276-2|author2=Glenys J. Woods|page=219|quote="There are unresolved conflicts here, principally between a science education based on "inaccurate science" that leads to better scientific understanding."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and geography==

History begins with "mythical and archetypal narrative" (age 6–9 years). At age 10 history lessons begin to draw upon the local environment in connection with local geography. Beginning at age 11, history is introduced as a formal subject.&lt;ref name="England"/&gt; Throughout elementary school, history is primarily taught through biography, allowing for a human context for historical events.

==Foreign languages==

Generally, two foreign languages are taught from age six on.&lt;ref name="England"/&gt; Foreign language instruction in the first two years is purely oral; reading and writing of foreign languages are generally introduced toward the end of third grade. Language teaching in the first three years aims to give the children a sense of a greater belonging and understanding of other cultures.&lt;ref name=RR/&gt;

==Art, crafts and handwork==

In the elementary years, drawing is practised daily and painting weekly; in addition, children are taught modelling and sculpture with [[beeswax]] or clay.&lt;ref name="England"/&gt; Also taught is an approach to drawing geometric and dynamic forms created by the early Waldorf pedagogue [[Hermann von Baravalle]] and known in the schools as "form drawing".&lt;ref name=RR/&gt; Art instruction continues through the high school.

Handwork (including [[knitting]], [[crochet]], [[sewing]] and [[embroidery]]) is taught from age 6 on, with projects which may include cushions, socks, gloves and dolls.&lt;ref name="England"/&gt; Woodworking normally begins during 5th or 6th grade. The secondary school crafts curriculum includes some combination of [[woodworking]], [[basketry]], [[weaving]] and [[book-binding]].&lt;ref name="Rist"&gt;Rist and Schneider, [http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0003/000363/036368eo.pdf ''Integrating Vocational and General Education: A Rudolf Steiner School''], Unesco Institute for Education, Hamburg 1979, {{ISBN|92-820-1024-4}}, pp. 74-90.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music==

In the elementary school, children sing daily with their class teacher. Generally, bi-weekly general music lessons with a specialized music teacher begin in Grade 1 and continue  through Grade 8. In High school, choir and various instrumental ensembles are continued, until the end of secondary school. Music is integrated into the teaching of academic subjects such as arithmetic, geography, history and science.&lt;ref&gt;Freda Easton, ''The Waldorf impulse in education:Schools as communities that educate the whole child by integrating artistic and academic work'', Ph.D. thesis, Columbia University Teachers College, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Recorder (musical instrument)|Recorder]]s, usually [[pentatonic]], are introduced in first grade, the familiar [[diatonic]] recorder in third or fourth grade, when the children also take up a string instrument: either violin, viola or cello. Waldorf pupils are generally required to take private music lessons when a class [[orchestra]] is formed, usually at age 9-10. By age 11-12, the children may switch to [[woodwind instrument|woodwind]] or [[brass instrument|brass]] instruments as part of the class orchestra or a separate band. Orchestral instruction continues through the end of a child's Waldorf experience, though in many schools it becomes elective at some point.&lt;ref name="TheAtlantic"/&gt;

==Eurythmy==

[[Eurythmy]] is a movement art, usually performed to poetry or music, created by Steiner and "meant to help children develop harmoniously with mind, body and soul".&lt;ref name="England"/&gt; Eurythmy is a required subject in Waldorf schools in all years.&lt;ref name="England"/&gt;

==Physical education==
Physical Education, or Movement Education as it is called in many Waldorf schools around the world, begins in the early grades with rhythmical activities, then proceeds to various games, the circus arts, the Greek pentathlon, and on to more competitive athletics and team sports as the student moves towards high school.  Bothmer Gymnastics was created by Fritz von Bothmer between 1922 and 1938 out of his work as the physical education teacher at the first Waldorf School established in Stuttgart, Germany. Bothmer Gymnastics™ offers a distinctive, planar approach to age-appropriate balance and coordination exercises.

'''Dahui Zonggao''' (1089&amp;ndash;1163) ({{zh|大慧宗杲}}; Wade–Giles: Ta-hui Tsung-kao; Japanese: Daie Sōkō; Vietnamese: Đại Huệ Tông Cảo) was a 12th-century [[China|Chinese]] [[Chan Buddhism|Chan]] (Zen) master. Dahui was a student of [[Yuanwu Keqin]] (Wade–Giles: Yuan-wu K'o-ch'in; Japanese: Engo Kokugon) (1063–1135) and was the 12th generation of the [[Linji school]] of Chan Buddhism. He was the dominant figure of the [[Linji school]] during the [[Song dynasty]].{{sfn|McRae|2003|123-133}}

Dahui introduced the practice of ''[[Hua Tou|kan huatou]]'', or "inspecting the critical phrase", of a [[kōan]] story. This method was called the "Chan of gongan (kōan) introspection" (Kanhua Chan).&lt;ref&gt;Yu, p. 211&lt;/ref&gt; Although he believed that kōans were the best way to achieve enlightenment, he also recognized the teaching of [[Confucius]] and [[Laozi]] as valuable.

Dahui was a vigorous critic of what he called the "heretical Chan of [[Shikantaza|silent illumination]]" (mozhao xie Chan) of the [[Caodong school]] (Wade–Giles: Ts'ao-tung; Japanese: [[Sōtō]]).

==Biography==

===Early years===
Dahui was born in [[Xuancheng]], [[Anhui]], to the Xi family. He left home at sixteen and became a Buddhist monk at seventeen. His initiatory name was Zong Gao. Following the tradition of the day, he wandered from Chan community to community, seeking instruction. He studied under a Caodong master and mastered the essentials of the [[Five Ranks]] in two years. He studied all the records of the [[Five Houses of Chan]], being particularly drawn to the words of [[Yunmen Wenyan]] (Wade–Giles: Yün-men Wên-yen Japanese: Ummon Bun’en), 864-949, founder of one of the "Five Houses" of Chan. He sought out instruction on the sayings of the old masters collected and commented on by [[Xuedou Chongxian]] (Wade–Giles: Hsüeh-tou Ch’ung-hsien; Japanese: Setchō Jūken) which became the basis for the koan collection, the ''[[Blue Cliff Record]]''.

===Tangzhou===
Dissatisfied with intellectual study, at the age of twenty-one he went to [[Treasure Peak]], near the modern city of Nanchang in Jiangxi Province, to study with [[Zhan Tangzhun]] (Wade–Giles: Chan-t'ang Wen-chun), a master of the [[Huang-lung]] branch of the Linji School. Although Dahui developed a great intellectual understanding of Chan, enlightenment eluded him. Recognizing his potential and great intellectual abilities, Zhan Tangzhun made Dahui his personal attendant. One day Tangzhou asked Dahui, 
:"Why are your nostrils boundless today?" 
:Dahui replied, "(Because) I’m at your place." 
:Tangzhou retorted, "You phony Chan man." &lt;ref&gt;Cleary, p. xi&lt;/ref&gt;

Another time, when Dahui was twenty-six, Tangzhou called him over and said,
{{quote|You can talk about Ch'an very well; you can quote the sayings of former masters and write commentaries on them. You are eloquent in giving sermons and quick with the exchanges during interviews. But there is one thing which you still do not know".

Ta-hui asked what it was.

Tangzhou answered, "What you do not have is the awakening. Thus, when I talk with you in my room, you have Chan. But as soon as you leave the room, you lose it. When you are awake and attentive, you have Chan. But as soon as you fall asleep, you lose it. If you continue like this, how can you ever conquer life and death?"

Dahui agreed, saying, "This is precisely my point of doubt."&lt;ref&gt;see Yu, p. 213 and Cleary, p. xii&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Yuanwu===
Dahui continued his studies with [[Yuanwu Keqin]]. On his way to Tianning Wanshou, a monastery in the old imperial city of Bian (modern [[Kaifeng]]), Dahui vowed to work with Yuanwu for nine years and if he did not achieve enlightenment, or, if Yuanwu turned out to be a false teacher, giving approval too easily, Dahui would give up and turn to writing scriptures or treatises.

Yuanwu gave Dahui Yunmen’s saying, "East Mountain walks on the water" as a koan to work through. Dahui threw himself into the koan and struggled with it day and night, giving forty-nine answers to the koan, but all were rejected by his teacher. Finally, on May 13, 1125, he broke through. Later, he recalled the event:
{{quote|Master Yuan-wu ascended the high seat in the lecture hall at the request of Madame Chang K'ang-kuo (張康國夫人). He said, "Once a monk asked Yun-men this question, 'where do all the [[Buddhahood|Buddhas]] come from?' Yun-men answered. 'The East Mountain walks over the water' (Tung-shan shuei sheng hsing). But if I were he, I would have given a different answer. 'Where do all the Buddhas come from?' 'As the fragrant breeze comes from the south, a slight coolness naturally stirs in the palace pavilion.'" When I heard this, all of a sudden there was no more before and after. Time stopped. I ceased to feel any disturbance in my mind, and remained in a state of utter calmness.&lt;ref&gt;Yu p. 214&lt;/ref&gt;}}

As it turned out, Yuanwu did not give approval too easily. He said, 
{{quote|It is indeed not easy to arrive at your present state of mind. But unfortunately, you have only died but are not yet reborn. Your greatest problem is that you do not doubt words enough. Don't you remember this saying? 'When you let go your hold on the precipice, you become the master of your own fate; to die and afterward come to life again, no one can then deceive you.&lt;ref&gt;Yu p. 215&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Yuanwu gave Dahui the koan, "To be and not to be --- it is like a [[wisteria]] leaning on a tree" to work on and after six months, Dahui achieved the final breakthrough and was recognized by Yuanwu as a [[Dharma]]-heir in the Linji tradition.

===Teaching career===
Yuanwu assigned teaching duties to Dahui and Dahui’s fame spread far and wide. A high ranking government official, the [[Minister of the Right]], Lu Shun, gave Dahui a purple robe and the honorific, "Fori", the Sun of the Dharma. The following year, 1126, the [[Jin dynasty (1115–1234)|Jürchen Jin dynasty]] captured the [[Emperor Huizong of Song|Emperors Huizong]] and [[Emperor Qinzong of Song|Qinzong]]; the capital was moved to the south and the Southern Song era began.

Dahui also moved south and taught both monks and laymen. It was at this time that he began his severe criticism of the "heretical Chan of silent illumination" of the Caodong school which he would continue for the rest of his life. He became a great favorite of the educated and literate classes as well as Chan monks and in 1137, at the age of forty-nine, [[Zhang Jun (Song chancellor)|Chancellor Zhang Jun]] (張浚), a student of Dahui, appointed him abbot of Jingshan monastery in the new capital Lin-an (modern [[Hangzhou]], [[Zhejiang]]). Within a few years his [[Sangha (Buddhism)|sangha]] grew to two thousand and among his lay followers were many high-ranking officials. Dahui became the acknowledged leader of Buddhism of the Southern Song dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;Yu, p. 216&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exile and return===
[[Image:Dahui_Zonggao_letter.jpg|thumb|A letter written by Dahui to a friend during his exile|right]]
However, disaster was about to befall him. Because of his association with a high official who fell out of favor with the prime minister, all Dahui’s imperial honors and his ordination certificate were stripped from him and he was sent in exile to Hengzhou ([[Hunan]]) in the year 1141. At the age of sixty-two he was transferred to present day [[Guangdong]], a place notorious in those days for plagues and hostile elements. Some fifty of Dahui’s monks died there in a plague.&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson, p. 441&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout these difficult years, Dahui continued teaching in the Linji tradition of Chan Buddhism, attracting both gentry and commoners. Finally, in 1155, Dahui was pardoned and was allowed to return to his former monastery at Jingshan where he continued his teaching until he died five years later on {{date|10 August 1163}}. He wrote a final verse for his disciples, saying, "Without a verse, I couldn’t die."
::Birth is thus
::Death is thus
::Verse or no verse
::What’s the fuss?&lt;ref name="Cleary, p. xvii"&gt;Cleary, p. xvii&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Emperor Xiaozong of Song]] bestowed upon him the posthumous title "Chan Master of Great Wisdom," from which the name Dahui derives.&lt;ref name="Cleary, p. xvii"/&gt;

==Teachings==
The enlightenment experience as the answer to the riddle of life and death, and the great doubt necessary to have the determination to break through, became central to Dahui’s teaching.

===K'an-hua chán===
Dahui’s letters to lay people reveal a compassionate teacher, who believed that the enlightenment promised by the Buddha was available to all people, regardless of their daily activities. The best way to achieve this was through the use of gong-ans as a daily meditation device.

====Gong-ans====
{{Main article|Koan}}

Gong-ans developed during the [[Tang Dynasty]] (618-907){{sfn|Schlütter|2008|p=111}} from the recorded sayings collections of Chán-masters, which quoted many stories of "a famous past Chán figure's encounter with disciples or other interlocutors and then offering his own comment on it".{{sfn|Schlütter|2008|p=109}} Those stories and the accompanying comments were used to educate students, and broaden their insight into the Buddhist teachings.

Those stories came to be known as gongan, "public cases".{{sfn|Schlütter|2008|p=109}} Such a story was only considered a gongan when it was commented upon by another Chán-master.{{sfn|Schlütter|2008|p=109}} This practice of commenting on the words and deeds of past masters confirmed the master's position as awakened master in a lineage of awakened masters of the past.{{sfn|Schlütter|2008|p=1109}}

Dahui saw this practice of commenting on gongans in his time as becoming a superficial literary study. In a radical move to counter this literary emphasis, he even ordered the suppression of his own teacher’s masterly collection of koans, The ''[[Blue Cliff Record]]'' (Wade–Giles: Pi Yen Lu; Pinyin: Bìyán Lù; Japanese: Hekiganroku), burning all copies and the wooden blocks to print them, effectively taking the venerated text out of circulation for the next two centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Foster &amp; Shoemaker, p. 186&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hua tou practice====
{{Main article|Hua Tou}}

Dahui introduced the use of ''k'an-hua'', the concentration on the [[Hua Tou|hua tou]] ("word head") of a [[Koan|gong-an]] to attain [[Enlightenment in Buddhism|insight]].{{sfn|Buswell|1991}}{{sfn|McRae|2003|p=126-133}}{{sfn|Schlütter|2008}} Until his time, the developing gongan-tradition consisted mainly of commenting on "old cases", adding comments and poetry. This use of written comments and poetry shows the influence of Chinese literati culture, to which both state officials and most Buddhist higher clergy belonged.{{sfn|Buswell|1991}}{{sfn|McRae|2003|p=126-133}}{{sfn|Schlütter|2008}}

Although there were hundreds of koans available, Dahui used only a few, believing that deep penetration of one or two koans would be enough to attain enlightenment. To achieve this, one had to work assiduously and with great determination, like someone whose "head is on fire".&lt;ref name="Yu, p. 226"&gt;Yu, p. 226&lt;/ref&gt; It mattered little to Dahui whether a person was particularly intelligent or not – liberation was available to all. He wrote: 
{{quote|It doesn’t matter whether your rational understanding is sharp or dull; it has nothing to do with matters of sharpness or dullness, nor does it have anything to do with quiet or confusion.&lt;ref&gt;Cleary, p. 63&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Dahui often used the famous [[Mu (negative)|mu-koan]], "A monk asked [[Zhaozhou Congshen|Zhàozhōu]], ‘Does a dog have Buddha-nature?’ Zhàozhōu replied, ‘No’ (Chinese: Wu; Japanese: [[Mu (negative)|Mu]]) (which later became the 18th koan in the collection ''[[The Book of Equanimity]]'' published 61 years after his death in 1224 and then appearing again as the first koan in ''[[The Gateless Gate]]'' published 4 years later in 1228). Dahui taught that 
{{quote|This one word ‘no’ is a knife to sunder the doubting mind of birth and death. The handle of this knife is in one’s own hand alone: you can’t have anyone else wield it for you…You consent to take hold of it yourself only if you can abandon your life. If you cannot abandon your life, just keep to where your doubt remains unbroken for a while: suddenly you’ll consent to abandon your life, and then you’ll be done.&lt;ref&gt;Cleary, p. 46&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Doubt====
The concept of ‘doubt’ was very important in Dahui’s teaching. He warned his students that they must ‘doubt’ words to not be fooled by them. Furthermore, they needed to ‘doubt’ their very existence. He said, 
{{quote|Many students today do not doubt themselves, but they doubt others. And so it is said, ‘Within great doubt there necessarily exists great enlightenment.’&lt;ref&gt;Dumoulin, p. 258&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Influence on the Rinzai-tradition====
His teachings on kanhua practice became the standard for the Linji school tradition of koan practice in China, Korea and Japan. Dahui exorted a strong influence on the Japanese [[Rinzai school|Rinzai]] teacher [[Hakuin Ekaku]], who also taught great doubt as necessary to awaken.

===Rejection of silent illumination===
{{Main article|Shikantaza}}

Dahui’s teachings contain relentless attacks on the practice of [[Shikantaza|silent illumination]], sitting in meditation in tranquility and quietness. He labeled teachers of this type of meditation practice as "heretical" and complained, 
{{quote|They just sit in a ghostly cave on a dark mountain after their meals. They call this practice "silent illumination", "dying the great death", "the state before the birth of one's parents." They sit there until calluses appear on their bottoms, yet they still do not dare to move." &lt;ref&gt;Yu p. 225&lt;/ref&gt;}}

To his opinion this type of practice leads to drowsiness, blankness and intellectualization and conceptualization of Chan Buddhism rather than enlightenment. He thought that teachers who taught this method of meditation had "never awakened themselves, they don’t believe anyone has awakened."&lt;ref&gt;Cleary, p. 111&lt;/ref&gt; For Dahui, koans were the only way to enlightenment and without koans, one would "be like a blind man without a walking stick: unable to take even one step."&lt;ref name="Yu, p. 226"/&gt; But koans had to be penetrated fully, not intellectualized. It was this fear of superficiality and intellectualization of old koans that led him to destroy all copies of his own teacher’s masterpiece, the ''Blue Cliff Record,'' to save Chan and to authenticate proper koan practice.

==Writings==
Only one work can be attributed to Dahui, a collection of koans entitled ''[[Zhengfa Yanzang]]'' 正法眼藏&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbeta.org/result/normal/X67/1309_001.htm Xuzangjing Vol. 67, No. 1309], Chinese Buddhist Electronic Text Association&lt;/ref&gt; (The Storehouse of the True Dharma Eye, J. ''Shobogenzo''){{refn|group=lower-alpha|[[Dogen]]'s unattributed use of Dahui's title ''Cheng-fa yen-tsang'' for Dogen's own most famous life work is an example of Dogen's broad influences. Upon arriving in China, Dogen first studied under Wuji Lepai, a disciple of Dahui, so this is most likely the source of Dogen's knowledge of Dahui's ''Cheng fa yen tsang''. Whether Dogen's failure to attribute his appropriation of the title was simply the manner of the day or deliberate obfuscation is open to interpretation and debate. See also Note 3 of [http://www.thezensite.com/ZenEssays/DogenStudies/some_problems_putney.htm Some Problems in Interpretation: The Early and Late Writings of Dogen]}}

Dahui also compiled the ''Chánlín Bǎo Xùn'' (禪林寶訓, "Treasured Teachings of the Chan Monastic Tradition"), instructions of former Chan abbots about the virtues and ideals of [[monasticism|monastic]] life, in collaboration with another monk, Dagui. A disciple of Dahui, [[Zuyong]], compiled a collection of Dahui’s life and teaching called ''Dahui Bujue Chanshi Nianbu'' ("Chronological Biography of Chan Master Dahui"). The ''Zhiyue lu'', compiled by [[Qu Ruji]], also contains information on Dahui’s teachings and is the basis of the J. C. Cleary translation ''Swampland Flowers,'' of which the majority is a collection of letters Dahui wrote to his students.&lt;ref&gt;Cleary, p. xxv-xxvi; Yu, p. 217 and p. 230 n. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

{{About|the composition of the text of the Bible|the events described in the Hebrew Bible|Chronology of the Bible|the events in the Gospels|Chronology of Jesus}}
The four tables give the most commonly accepted dates or ranges of dates for the [[Old Testament]]/[[Hebrew Bible]], the [[Deuterocanonical books]] (included in [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] and [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] bibles, but not in the Hebrew and [[Protestantism|Protestant]] bibles) and the [[New Testament]], including, where possible, hypotheses about their formation-history.

Table I is a chronological overview. Table II treats the Old Testament/Hebrew Bible books, grouped according to the divisions of the Hebrew Bible with occasional reference to scholarly divisions. Table III gives the Deuterocanonical books. Table IV gives the books of the New Testament, including the earliest preserved fragments for each. The tables are in chronological order in reference to how they read in the Bible.

==Table I: Chronological overview==
This table summarises the chronology of the main tables and serves as a guide to the historical periods mentioned. Much of the Hebrew Bible/Old Testament may have been assembled in the 5th century BCE.{{sfn|Berquist|2007|p=3–4}} The New Testament books were composed largely in the second half of the 1st century CE.{{sfn|Perkins|2012|p=19ff.}} The [[Deuterocanonical books]] fall largely in between.

|[[Book of Genesis]]&lt;br&gt;[[Book of Exodus]]&lt;br&gt;[[Book of Leviticus]]&lt;br&gt;[[Book of Numbers]]&lt;br/&gt;[[Book of Deuteronomy]]
|The majority of modern biblical scholars believe that the [[Torah]] – the books of Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers and Deuteronomy – reached its present form in the [[Second Temple Judaism|post-Exilic period]].{{sfn|Enns|2012|p=5}} 

The five books are drawn from four "sources" (distinct schools of writers rather than individuals): the [[Priestly source]], the [[Yahwist]] and the [[Elohist]] (these two are often referred to collectively as the "non-Priestly" source), and the [[Deuteronomist]].{{sfn|Carr|2000|p=492}} There is general agreement that the Priestly source is post-exilic, but there is no agreement over the non-Priestly source(s).{{sfn|Carr|2000|p=492}}

* Genesis is a post-exilic work combining "Priestly" and "non-Priestly" material.{{sfn|Carr|2007|p=10}}
* Exodus is an anthology drawn from nearly all periods of Israel's history.{{sfn|Dozeman|2000|p=443}}
* Leviticus is entirely Priestly and dates from the exilic/post-exilic period.{{sfn|Houston|2003|p=102}}
* Numbers is a Priestly redaction (i.e., editing) of a [[Yahwist]]ic/non-Priestly original.{{sfn|McDermott|2002|p=21}}
* Deuteronomy, now the last book of the Torah, began as the set of religious laws (these make up the bulk of the book), was extended in the early part of the 6th century to serve as the introduction to the [[Deuteronomistic history]], and later still was detached from that history, extended yet again, and edited to conclude the Torah.{{sfn|Van Seters|2004|p=93}}

|This group of books, plus Deuteronomy, is called the "[[Deuteronomistic history]]" by scholars. The proposal that they made up a unified work was first advanced by [[Martin Noth]] in 1943, and has been widely accepted. Noth proposed that the entire history was the creation of a single individual working in the exilic period (6th century BCE); since then there has been wide recognition that the history appeared in two "editions", the first in the reign of Judah's [[King Josiah]] (late 7th century), the second during the exile (6th century).{{sfn|Campbell|O'Brien|2000|p=2 and fn.6}} Noth's dating was based on the assumption that the history was completed very soon after its last recorded event, the release of King [[Jehoiachin]] in Babylon c. 560 BCE; but some scholars have termed his reasoning inadequate, and the history may have been further extended in the post-exilic period.{{sfn|Person|2010|p=10-11}}
|-
|Three Major Prophets: 
[[Book of Isaiah#Composition|Book of Isaiah]]&lt;br&gt;[[Book of Jeremiah#Composition|Book of Jeremiah]]&lt;br&gt;[[Book of Ezekiel]]
|Scholars recognise three "sections" in the [[Book of Isaiah]]: Proto-Isaiah (the original 8th century Isaiah); Deutero-Isaiah (an anonymous prophet living in Babylon during the exile); and Trito-Isaiah (an anonymous author or authors in Jerusalem immediately after the exile).{{sfn|Sweeney|1998|p=76-77}}

The [[Book of Jeremiah]] exists in two versions, Greek (the version used in Orthodox Christian Bibles) and Hebrew (Jewish, Catholic and Protestant Bibles), with the Greek representing the earlier version.{{sfn|Allen|2008|p=7-8}} The Greek version was probably finalised in the early Persian period and translated into Greek in the 3rd century BCE, and the Hebrew version dates from some point between then and the 2nd century BCE.{{sfn|Sweeney|2010|p=94}}

The [[Book of Ezekiel]] describes itself as the words of the [[Ezekiel]] ben-Buzi, a priest living in exile in the city of [[Babylon]], and internal evidence dates the visions to between 593 and 571 BCE. While the book probably reflects much of the historic Ezekiel, it is the product of a long and complex history, with significant additions by a "school" of later followers.{{sfn|Blenkinsopp|1996|p=8}}{{sfn|Joyce|2009|p=16}}

| 80–90 CE.{{sfn|Duling|2010|p=298-299}} This is based on three strands of evidence: (a) the setting of Matthew reflects the final separation of Church and Synagogue, about 85 CE; (b) it reflects the capture of Jerusalem and destruction of the Temple by the Romans in 70 CE; (c) it uses Mark, usually dated around 70 CE, as a source.{{sfn|France|2007|p=18}}

| 57-58 CE.{{sfn|Powell|2018|p=275}} One of the indisputably genuine Pauline letters, written to the Romans as Paul was about to leave Asia Minor and Greece, and expressing his hopes to continue his work in Spain.{{sfn|Perkins|2012|p=19ff}} 
| {{Papyrus link|46}} (late 2nd century or 3rd century CE)
|-
| [[First Epistle to the Corinthians|1 Corinthians]]
| 53-57 CE.{{sfn|Powell|2018|p=295}} One of the indisputably genuine Pauline letters. Paul expresses his intention to re-visit the church he founded in the city c. 50–52 CE.{{sfn|Perkins|2012|p=19ff}}
| {{Papyrus link|46}} (late 2nd century or 3rd century CE)
|-
| [[Second Epistle to the Corinthians|2 Corinthians]]
| 55-58 CE.{{sfn|Powell|2018|p=314}} One of the indisputably genuine Pauline letters.  Written by Paul in Macedonia after having left Ephesus.{{sfn|Powell|2018|p=313}}
| {{Papyrus link|46}} (late 2nd century or 3rd century CE)
|-
| [[Epistle to the Galatians|Galatians]]
| c. 48 or 55 CE.{{sfn|Powell|2018|p=327}} One of the indisputably genuine Pauline letters.  The dating of this letter depends on whether it was written to the northern or southern portion of Galatia (with the former representing the later date). {{sfn|Powell|2018|p=326-327}}
| {{Papyrus link|46}} (late 2nd century or 3rd century CE)
|-
| [[Ephesians]]
| c. 80–90 CE. The letter appears to have been written after Paul's death in Rome, by an author who uses his name.{{sfn|Perkins|2012|p=19ff}}
| {{Papyrus link|46}} (late 2nd century or 3rd century CE)
|-
| [[Philippians]]
| c. 54–55 CE. A genuine Pauline letter, it mentions "Caesar's household," leading some scholars to believe that it is written from Rome, but some of the news in it could not have come from Rome. It seems rather to date from an earlier imprisonment, perhaps in Ephesus, from which Paul hopes to be released.{{sfn|Perkins|2012|p=19ff}}
| {{Papyrus link|46}} (late 2nd century or 3rd century CE)
|-
| [[Colossians]]
| c. 62–70 CE. Some scholars believe Colossians dates from Paul's imprisonment in Ephesus around 55 CE, but differences in the theology suggest that it comes from much later in his career, around the time of his imprisonment in Rome.{{sfn|Perkins|2012|p=19ff}}
| {{Papyrus link|46}} (late 2nd century or 3rd century CE)
|-
| [[1 Thessalonians]]
| c. 51 CE. One of the earliest of the genuine Pauline epistles.{{sfn|Perkins|2012|p=19ff}}
| {{Papyrus link|46}} (late 2nd century or 3rd century CE)
|-
| [[2 Thessalonians]]
| c. 51 CE or post-70 CE. If this is a genuine Pauline epistle it follows closely on 1 Thessalonians. But some of the language and theology point to a much later date, from an unknown author using Paul's name.{{sfn|Perkins|2012|p=19ff}}
| {{Papyrus link|92}} (300 CE)
|-
| [[1 Timothy]], [[2 Timothy]], [[Epistle to Titus]]
| c. 100 CE. The two Timothy epistles and Titus reflect a much more developed Church organisation than that reflected in the genuine Pauline epistles.{{sfn|Perkins|2012|p=19ff}}
| [[Codex Sinaiticus]] (350 CE){{Papyrus link|32}} (200 CE)
|-
| [[Paul's Letter to Philemon|Philemon]]
| c. 54–55 CE. A genuine Pauline epistle, written from an imprisonment (probably in Ephesus) that Paul expects will soon be over.{{sfn|Perkins|2012|p=19ff}}
| {{Papyrus link|87}} (3rd century CE)
|-
| [[Letter to the Hebrews|Hebrews]]
| c. 80–90 CE. The elegance of the Greek and the sophistication of the theology do not fit the genuine Pauline epistles, but the mention of Timothy in the conclusion led to its being included with the Pauline group from an early date.{{sfn|Perkins|2012|p=19ff}}
| {{Papyrus link|46}} (late 2nd century or 3rd century CE)
|-
| [[Epistle of James|James]]
| c. 65–85 CE. Like Hebrews, James is not so much a letter as an exhortation; the style of the Greek makes it unlikely that it was actually written by James the brother of Jesus.{{sfn|Perkins|2012|p=19ff}}
| {{Papyrus link|20}}, {{Papyrus link|23}} (early 3rd century CE)
|-
| [[First Peter]]
| c. 75–90 CE{{sfn|Perkins|2012|p=19ff}}
| {{Papyrus link|72}} (3rd/4th century CE)
|-
| [[Second Peter]]
| c. 110 CE. This is apparently the latest writing in the New Testament, quoting from Jude, assuming a knowledge of the Pauline letters, and including a reference to the gospel story of the [[Transfiguration of Christ]].{{sfn|Perkins|2012|p=19ff}}
| {{Papyrus link|72}} (3rd/4th century CE)
|-
| [[Epistles of John]]
| 90–110 CE.{{sfn|Kim|2003|p=250}} The letters give no clear indication, but scholars tend to place them about a decade after the Gospel of John.{{sfn|Kim|2003|p=250}}
| {{Papyrus link|9}}, [[Uncial 0232]], [[Codex Sinaiticus]] (3rd/4th century CE)
|-
| [[Epistle of Jude|Jude]]
| Uncertain. The references to "brother of James" and to "what the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ foretold" suggest that it was written after the apostolic letters were in circulation, but before 2 Peter, which uses it.{{sfn|Perkins|2012|p=19ff}}
| {{Papyrus link|72}} (3rd/4th century CE)
|-
| [[Book of Revelation|Revelation]]
| c. 95 CE. The date is suggested by clues in the visions pointing to the reign of the emperor [[Domitian]].{{sfn|Perkins|2012|p=19ff}}
| {{Papyrus link|98}} (150–200 CE)

{{Refimprove|date=December 2007}}

The '''doctrine of necessity''' is the basis on which extra-legal actions by state actors, which are designed to restore order, are found to be constitutional. The [[legal maxim|maxim]] on which the doctrine is based originated in the writings of the medieval jurist [[Henry de Bracton]], and similar justifications for this kind of extra-legal action have been advanced by more recent legal authorities, including [[William Blackstone]].

In modern times, the doctrine was first used in a controversial 1954 judgment in which Pakistani Chief Justice [[Muhammad Munir]] validated the extra-constitutional use of emergency powers by [[Governor-General of Pakistan|Governor General]], [[Malik Ghulam Muhammad|Ghulam Mohammad]].&lt;ref name="ref16zifem"&gt;{{Citation | title=The post-colonial states of South Asia: democracy, development, and identity | author=Amita Shastri, A. Jeyaratnam Wilson | publisher=Palgrave Macmillan, 2001 | isbn=978-0-312-23852-0 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=du7xvBFpbg4C | quote=''... Dismissing Mirza, army chief General Mohammad Ayub Khan took over first as chief martial law administrator ... a compliant judiciary upheld the imposition of martial law under the doctrine of necessity ...''}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his judgment, the Chief Justice cited [[Henry de Bracton|Bracton's]] [[Legal maxim|maxim]], 'that which is otherwise not lawful is made lawful by necessity', thereby providing the label that would come to be attached to the judgment and the doctrine that it was establishing.

The doctrine of necessity has since been applied in a number of [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries, and in 2010 was invoked to justify extra-legal actions in [[Nigeria]].

==Pakistan, 1954: First use==
On 24 October 1954 the Governor-General of Pakistan, [[Malik Ghulam Muhammad|Ghulam Mohammad]], dissolved the [[Constituent Assembly of Pakistan|Constituent Assembly]] and appointed a new Council of Ministers on the grounds that the existing one no longer represented the people of Pakistan. [[Stanley Alexander de Smith|Stanley de Smith]] argues that the real reason for the dissolution was because Mohammad objected to the constitution which the Assembly was about to adopt.&lt;ref&gt;Wolf-Phillips, Leslie.  "Constitutional Legitimacy: A Study of the Doctrine of Necessity." ''Third World Quarterly'', Vol. 1, No. 4 (October 1979) 98.&lt;/ref&gt;  The President of the Constituent Assembly, [[Maulvi Tamizuddin]], appealed to the Chief Court of Sind at Karachi to restrain the new Council of Ministers from implementing the dissolution and to determine the validity of the appointment of the new Council under Section 223-A of the constitution.

In response, members of the new Council of Ministers appealed to the court saying that it had no jurisdiction to approve the request of the President to overturn the dissolution and appointments.  They argued that Section 223-A of the constitution had never been validly enacted into the Constitution because it was never approved of by the Governor-General, and therefore anything submitted under it was invalid.  The Chief Court of Sind ruled in favour of President Tamizuddin and held that the Governor-General's approval was not needed when the Constituent Assembly was acting only as a Constituent Assembly and not as the Federal Legislature.&lt;ref&gt;Judgement and Order of the Chief Court of Sind at Karachi, 9 February 1955, PLD 1955 Sind 96.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Federation of Pakistan and the new Council of Ministers then appealed to the court, the appeal was heard in March 1955 (''Federation of Pakistan v Maulvi Tamizuddin Khan'').

In the appeal hearing under Chief Justice Muhammad Munir, the court decided that the Constituent Assembly functioned as the 'Legislature of the Domain' and that the Governor-General's assent was necessary for all legislation to become law.  Therefore, the Chief Court of Sind had no jurisdiction to overturn the Governor General's dissolution and it was held as valid.

However, the ground of which the court found in favour of the Federation of Pakistan called into question the validity of all legislation passed by the Assembly, not to mention the unconstitutionality of the Assembly itself since 1950.  To solve this problem, the Governor-General invoked Emergency Powers to retrospectively validate the Acts of the Constituent Assembly. An appeal was filed against the Governor-General for invoking emergency powers and the Chief Justice had to determine the constitutionality of invoking the Emergency Powers and whether the Governor-General could give his assent to legislation retroactively.&lt;ref&gt;Wolf-Phillips, Leslie.  "Constitutional Legitimacy: A Study of the Doctrine of Necessity." ''Third World Quarterly'', Vol. 1, No. 4 (October 1979) 99.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Court held that in this case the Governor-General could not invoke emergency powers because in doing so he validated certain laws that had been invalid because he had not assented to them previously.  Justice Munir also ruled that constitutional legislation could not be validated by the Governor General but had to be approved by the Legislature.  The lack of a Constituent Assembly did not transfer the Legislature's powers over to the Governor-General.

The Court was referred to for an opinion. On 16 May 1955 it ruled:

# The Governor General in certain circumstances had the power to dissolve the Constituent Assembly.
# The Governor-General has during the interim period the power 'under the common law of civil or state necessity' of retrospectively validating the laws listed in the Schedule to the Emergency Powers ordinance.
#  The new Assembly (formed under the Constituent Convention Order 1955) would be valid and able to exerise all powers under the ''[[Indian Independence Act 1947]]''.&lt;ref&gt;PLD 1955 I FC 561-5&lt;/ref&gt;

In his verdict, Munir declared it was necessary to go beyond the constitution to what he claimed was the Common Law, to general legal maxims, and to English historical precedent. He relied on [[Henry de Bracton|Bracton's]] maxim, 'that which is otherwise not lawful is made lawful by necessity', and the Roman law maxim urged by [[Ivor Jennings]], 'the well-being of the people is the supreme law'.

==Grenada, 1985: Second use==
In a 1985 judgment, the Chief Justice of the High Court of [[Grenada]] invoked the doctrine of necessity to validate the legal existence of a court then trying for murder the persons who had conducted a coup against former leader [[Maurice Bishop]]. The court had been established under an unconstitutional "People's Law" following the overthrow of the country's constitution, which had subsequently been restored. The defendants argued that the court before which they were being tried had no legal existence under the restored constitution, and they were therefore being deprived of their constitutional right to a trial before a "Court established by law". The High Court acknowledged that the lower court "had come into existence in an unconstitutional manner", but "the doctrine of necessity validated its acts."&lt;ref&gt;[[H.V. Evatt]] and [[Eugene Forsey]], ''Evatt and Forsey on the Reserve Powers''. (Sydney: Legal Books, 1990), p. xciv.&lt;/ref&gt; On this basis, the murder trials were allowed to proceed.

==Nigeria, 2010: Nigerian parliament creates an Acting President==
A related (although non-judicial) use of the doctrine took place when, on 9 February 2010, the [[Nigeria]]n National Assembly passed a resolution making Vice President [[Goodluck Jonathan]] the Acting President and Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces. Both chambers of the Assembly passed the resolution after President [[Umaru Yar'Adua]], who for 78 days had been in [[Saudi Arabia]] receiving medical treatment, was unable to formally empower the vice president to exercise full powers as acting president, as provided for in Section 145 of the country's constitution. No provision of the Nigerian constitution empowering the National Assembly to pass any such resolution, causing Senate President [[David Mark]] to assert that the Senate had been guided by the "doctrine of necessity" in arriving at its decision.

'''Elizabeth Kiss''' (born 1961) is an American philosopher and academic administrator, specialising in [[Moral philosophy|moral]] and [[political philosophy]]. Since 2018, she has been the Warden of [[Rhodes House]], Oxford University, and CEO of the Rhodes Trust.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/people/interview-elizabeth-kiss-agnes-scott-college|title=Interview with Elizabeth Kiss|date=2018-03-08|work=Times Higher Education (THE)|access-date=2018-08-03|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Agnes Scott's Elizabeth Kiss to Head Rhodes Trust|url=http://www.ajc.com/news/local/agnes-scott-elizabeth-kiss-head-rhodes-trust/fgJLiDJFCij2khZXhe4BGM/|publisher=Atlanta Journal Constitution|date=January 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is responsible for administering the [[Rhodes Scholarship]], providing pastoral support to existing Rhodes Scholars and coordinating the Rhodes Trust.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.oxfordstudent.com/2018/01/24/next-warden-of-rhodes-house-selected/|title=Next Warden of Rhodes House selected – The Oxford Student|date=2018-01-24|work=The Oxford Student|access-date=2018-09-07|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is the first woman to hold this role. Previously she served as president of [[Agnes Scott College]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Early life and education==
Kiss's parents along with her two older siblings emigrated from Hungary to the United States in 1956 following the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Hungarian Revolution]]. Kiss was born in New York City and gained her undergraduate degree in 1983 from [[Davidson College]] in North Carolina. She was elected a [[Rhodes Scholar]] in 1983, studied at [[Balliol College, Oxford|Balliol College]] and received a [[D.Phil.]] from the [[University of Oxford]] in 1990.&lt;ref name="Balliol Alumna"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.balliol.ox.ac.uk/news/2018/january/balliol-alumna-to-be-first-female-warden-of-rhodes-house|title=Balliol alumna to be first female Warden of Rhodes House|publisher=balliol.ox.ac.uk|accessdate=19 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Speaking about her childhood in a 2018 interview for ''Times Higher Education'' she said, "Being the 'American kid' in a family of refugees and political prisoners (my father was imprisoned in Hungary by both the Nazi and communist regimes) and growing up bilingual in a multicultural neighbourhood gave me experience from an early age of straddling different worlds." &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In the same interview she claims it was her two older siblings' taste in 1960s music and political activism that sparked her interest in ethics, politics, and human rights.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Kiss became involved with student activism during her time at Davidson College, setting up the college’s Amnesty International chapter and becoming the first female Davidson student to win a Rhodes Scholarship.

==Career==
Much of Kiss's research has focused on [[political philosophy]] and [[moral education]] which she believes is essential to personal and professional development.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

From 1997 to 2006, Kiss was the founding director of the [[Kenan Institute for Ethics]] at [[Duke University]] in [[Durham, North Carolina]].&lt;ref name="Agnes Scott News "&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.agnesscott.edu/news/archive/2018/01/ek_announcement.html|title=The Rhodes Trust announces Dr Elizabeth Kiss as its new Warden &amp; CEO|publisher=agnesscott.edu|accessdate=19 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She served as the eighth President of [[Agnes Scott College]] in [[Decatur, Georgia]] from 2006 to 2018.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; 
In 2015, she devised the SUMMIT curriculum at the college, which aims to provide students with a core curriculum where [[leadership development]] and global learning are the focuses.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; As college president, she changed the institution’s demographic to include one-third African-American students.

In August 2018, she began her tenure as Warden of [[Rhodes House]] at the [[University of Oxford]], and CEO of the [[Rhodes Trust]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

{{Lead rewrite|reason=no definition|date=October 2018}}
The book "New Bottles for New Wine" by [[Julian Huxley]], 1957, contains a collection of his essays beginning with  "[[Transhumanism]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Huxley|first=Julian|authorlink=Julian Huxley|title=New Bottles for New Wine|url=http://www.transhumanism.org/index.php/WTA/more/huxley|year=1957|publisher=[[Chatto &amp; Windus]]/ [[World Transhumanist Association]]|location=London|pages=13–17|chapter=Transhumanism|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110522082157/http://www.transhumanism.org/index.php/WTA/more/huxley|archivedate=2011-05-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ending with "'''Evolutionary Humanism'''".  In the latter essay, Huxley called for a new religion compatible with science.

'Evolutionary Humanism' is the English language name of a book by Dr [[Michael Schmidt-Salomon]] which suggests that [[evolutionary theory]] has implications for morality. Schmidt argues that the theory of evolution does not prescribe a particular set of moral values but it does require people to consider their moral principles free from religious beliefs. Belief in evolution should be combined with a modern humanist philosophy.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

Another theory of 'Evolutionary Humanism' is being developed by self-styled philosopher, Roland Herrmann, which holds that human behaviors, emotions, morals, feelings, and thought processes can be traced backward along the human evolutionary tree, rising in earlier animals. The theory holds that these emotions and behaviors are present on a variety of levels in various other species of animals, not only in primates and cetaceans in which these behaviors are most obvious. By recognizing that other animals can be sentient and can have complex thought processes and relationships, a closer bond and stewardship of the planet is necessary. Mr. Herrmann’s earlier website on this subject, www.evolutionaryhumanism.org, was transferred and is no longer associated with his school of thought.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

'''Francis of Mayrone''' (also '''Franciscus de Mayronis'''; c. 1280–1328) was a French [[scholasticism|scholastic philosopher]]. He was a distinguished pupil of [[Duns Scotus]], whose teaching ([[Scotism]]) he usually followed.

He acquired a great reputation for ability in discussion at the Sorbonne, and was known as the ''Doctor Illuminatus'' 'Enlightened teacher', as ''Magister Acutus'' or ''Doctor acutus'', and as ''Magister abstractionum'' 'Master of abstractions'.

==Biography==
Francis Meyronnes was not only an important medieval French philosopher, but also: a theologian, a student, a teacher, and a minister. He was born (c.a 1288) in Provence, France (located in the southwest region); Meyronnes was probably from a noble family, who were well connected to the house of Anjou. Meyronnes joined the Order of Friars Minor, more commonly known as the Franciscans. He studied philosophy and theology at the University of Paris (c.a 1304-1307) under John Duns Scotus at the University of Paris.  Meyronnes was considered a Scotist; however, he was more of an independent-minded follower of Scotus&lt;ref&gt;1 Pasnau, Robert. "The Cambridge History of Medieval Philosophy" (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;
Meyronnes  lectured on the Sentences, in Paris, from 1320 to 1321. In that same year, Meyronnes and Pierre Auriol (both Franciscans) engaged in a famous debate with Pierre Roger ("the champion of Thomism" who would soon be Clement VI); the theological questions discussed were taken from the Sententiae of Peter Lombard (a scholastic theologian, bishop, and author of Four Books of Sentences).&lt;ref&gt;John E. Wrigley, "Clement VI Before His Pontificate: The Early Life of Pierre Roger, 1290/91-1342". The Catholic Historical Review, Vol. 56, No.3 (1970),&lt;/ref&gt;
Robert of Anjou, who was at the time the king of Sicily, requested to Pope John XXII to title Meyronnes as a master in theology. So, on 24 May 1323, the chancellor of the University of Paris (commanded by Pope John XXII) deemed Meyronnes to be a master in theology. Francis served as the Provincial Minister of Provence, from 1323 to 1328. During his Provincial Ministering, Francis actively preached, taught, and served as the pope’s ambassador in Gascogne. Francis Meyronnes died in 1328 in Piacenza, Italy, leaving behind an extensive collection of discourses on a wide, comprehensive rage of topics. Topics include religion, economics, philosophy, human cognition, politics, the nature of space, and the possibility of other worlds.&lt;ref&gt;Garcia, Jorge J.E &amp; Timothy B. Noone (eds.), "A Companion to Philosophy in the Middle Ages."  (Malden, MA: Blackwell, 2003). pg. 256-257&lt;/ref&gt;

He took part in the discussions on the [[Universal (metaphysics)|nature of Universals]]. Following Duns Scotus, he adopted the [[Platonism|Platonic]] [[theory of ideas]], and denied that [[Aristotle]] had made any contribution to metaphysical speculation. It is a curious commentary on the theories of Duns Scotus that one pupil, Francis, should have taken this course, while another pupil, [[William of Occam]], should have used his arguments in a diametrically opposite direction and ended in extreme [[Nominalism]].

Francis Meyronnes major work was his commentary on Sententiae. Currently, the final version of Book 1 of the Sententiae, also called Conflatus, shows a very elaborate Prologue. In this Prologue are twenty-one quaestiones, which have made a huge impression on later commentaries on the Sentences.&lt;ref&gt;Antonie Vos, "Formalities and intrinsecus mode. The Development of Metaphysics in Scotism", Medieval Sermon Studies, Vol. 53, 2009, Maney Publishing, pg. 80&lt;/ref&gt;
A second famous work by Meyronnes are his Quodlibeta, which in Latin means, "Questions on whatever you like". This presented the opportunity for students in medieval universities to question and test their teachers.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher David Schabel.

Some of Francis Meyronnes’ other works include: his dispute over Trinity with Pierre Roger, lectures on the ars vetus and the physics, a treatise on the transcendentals, a large number of sermons, a treatise on intuitive cognition, and other various political treatises.&lt;ref&gt;Garcia, Jorge J.E &amp; Timothy B. Noone (eds.), "A Companion to Philosophy in the Middle Ages."  (Malden, MA: Blackwell, 2003). pg. 256-257&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="38776">'''French philosophy''', here taken to mean [[philosophy]] in the [[French language]], has been extremely diverse and has influenced [[Western philosophy]] as a whole for centuries, from the medieval scholasticism of [[Peter Abelard]], through the founding of [[modern philosophy]] by [[René Descartes]], to 20th century [[philosophy of science]], [[existentialism]], [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], [[structuralism]], and [[postmodernism]].

==Medieval period==

===Peter Abelard===
{{Main|Peter Abelard}}
[[Image:Edmund Blair Leighton - Abaelard Und Seine Schülerin Heloisa.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Abelard with [[Heloïse (abbess)|Héloïse]]]]
Peter Abelard (1079 – April 21, 1142) was a [[Scholasticism|scholastic]] [[philosopher]], [[theologian]] and [[logician]]. The story of his affair with and love for [[Heloïse (abbess)|Héloïse]] has become legendary. The ''[[Chambers Biographical Dictionary]]'' describes him as "the keenest thinker and boldest theologian of the 12th Century".&lt;ref name="CBD"&gt;''[[Chambers Biographical Dictionary]]'', 2011, {{ISBN|0-550-18022-2}}, page 3&lt;/ref&gt;

The general importance of Abelard lies in his having fixed more decisively than anyone before him the scholastic manner of philosophizing, with the object of giving a formally rational expression to received ecclesiastical doctrine. However his own particular interpretations may have been condemned, they were conceived in essentially the same spirit as the general scheme of thought afterwards elaborated in the 13th century with approval from the heads of the Church.

He helped to establish the ascendancy of the philosophical authority of [[Aristotle]] which became firmly established in the half-century after his death. It was at this time that the completed [[Organon]], and gradually all the other works of the Greek thinker, first came to be available in the schools. Before his time [[Plato]]'s authority was the basis for the prevailing Realism. As regards his so-called Conceptualism and his attitude to the question of Universals, see [[Scholasticism]].

Outside of his dialectic, it was in ethics that Abelard showed greatest activity of philosophical thought. He laid particular stress upon the subjective intention as determining, if not the moral character, at least the moral value, of human action. His thought in this direction, anticipating something of modern speculation, is the more remarkable because his scholastic successors accomplished least in the field of morals, hardly venturing to bring the principles and rules of conduct under pure philosophical discussion, even after the great ethical inquiries of Aristotle became fully known to them.

[[Pope Innocent III]] accepted Abelard's Doctrine of Limbo, which amended [[Augustine of Hippo]]'s Doctrine of Original Sin. The Vatican accepted the view that unbaptized babies did not, as at first believed, go straight to Hell but to a special area of [[limbo]], "limbus infantium". They would therefore feel no pain but no supernatural happiness either (only natural) because, it was held, they would not be able to see the deity that created them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/cti_documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_20070419_un-baptised-infants_en.html |title=The Hope of Salvation for Infants Who Die Without Being Baptised |author=International Theological Commission, the Vatican |accessdate=2008-12-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081222011157/http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/cti_documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_20070419_un-baptised-infants_en.html |archivedate=2008-12-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== 16th century ==

'''[[Michel Eyquem de Montaigne]]''' (1533–1592) may have been Catholic, but his anti-dogmatic stances made him the father of the anti-conformist French spirit. His work consists of little trials for his beliefs, filled with autobiographical and casual anecdotes. His intention with these papers was to leave something by which family could remember him. He was the first person to use the word [[Essays (Montaigne)|essays]], and his writings came to be highly influential upon [[Shakespeare]], [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]] and [[Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche|Nietzsche]]. His radical [[scepticism]], summed up in the phrase ''Que sais-je?'', served as one of the catalysts for [[René Descartes|René Descartes']] oeuvre.

== 17th century ==
[[Image:Frans Hals - Portret van René Descartes.jpg|thumb|150px|right|René Descartes is considered as the founder of modern philosophy.]]

[[Modern philosophy]] began in France with the philosophy of [[René Descartes]] (1596–1650). His ''[[Meditations on First Philosophy]]'' changed the primary object of philosophical thought from [[ontology]] to [[epistemology]] and overcame the Aristotelian dogmatism inherited in philosophy from [[Scholasticism]], the dominant form of thought in preceding centuries, while simultaneously raising some of the most fundamental problems for future generations of philosophers.

=== René Descartes ===
{{Main|René Descartes}}
René Descartes was concerned with the uncertainty in the sciences and the radical scepticism which spread across Europe when publications of [[Sextus Empiricus]] became available. Descartes desired to find indubitable ground on which all the sciences could be placed and progressively built. Thus he rejected anything which appeared uncertain and decided to only accept [[Apodicticity|apodeictic]] knowledge as truth.

After invoking the possibility of an omnipotent deceiver to reject the external world, the information given to him from his senses, mathematics and logic, Descartes discovered at least one thing could be known apodictically. If he himself was doubting, then he had to exist. Thus [[Cogito Ergo Sum]] - I think, therefore I am - became the first principle of [[Cartesianism]].

Descartes then claimed that because he discovered the Cogito through perceiving it clearly and distinctly, anything he can perceive clearly and distinctly must be true. Then he argues that he can conceive of an infinite being, but finite beings cannot produce infinite ideas and hence an infinite being must have put the idea into his mind. He uses this argument, commonly known as an [[ontological argument]], to invoke the existence of an omni-benevolent God as the indubitable foundation that makes all sciences possible. Many people admired Descartes intentions, but were unsatisfied with this solution. Some accused him of [[Cartesian circle|circularity]], proclaiming his ontological argument uses his definition of truth as a premise, while his proof of his definition of truth uses his ontological argument as a premise. Hence the problems of [[solipsism]], truth and the existence of the external world came to dominate 17th century western thought.

Another famous problem arises from Descartes’ [[substance dualism]]. For Descartes, a substance is that which can be conceived independent of everything else and exist independent of anything else. Since Descartes conceived of the mind independent of everything else when doubting everything uncertain, and because if he wanted to God could produce a world in which only the mind existed, he came to define the mind as a different substance from that of body. For Descartes, the mind is defined as an unextended substance and the body as an extended substance. This raised the fundamental question of how it is possible that mind and body interact with one another.&lt;ref&gt;This section of the article references René Descartes’ ''Discourse on Method'' and ''Meditations on First Philosophy''.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nicolas Malebranche ===
{{Main|Nicolas Malebranche}}

One solution to the [[mind–body problem]] came from Cartesian [[Nicolas Malebranche]] (1638–1715). Malebranche maintained that created substances of a different kind cannot interact with one another. In fact, he believed substances of the same kind could not interact either because no necessary causation could be perceived. He proposes then that it is God, an uncreated substance, who brings it about that each time one perceives a 'cause', one also perceives an 'effect'. Hence the doctrine is named [[occasionalism]].

Malebranche was well-known and celebrated in his own time, but has since become somewhat of an obscure figure in the history of western philosophy. His philosophy had a profound effect on it, however, through its influence upon [[Spinoza]] and [[David Hume|Hume]], whose problem of causation was influenced by Malebranche’s occasionalism. It’s possible that Malebranche also influenced [[George Berkeley]], although he rejects any association with Malebranche beyond superficial similarities.

== 18th century ==
[[File:D'après Nicolas de Largillière, portrait de Voltaire (Institut et Musée Voltaire) -001.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Voltaire came to embody the Enlightenment.]]

French philosophy in the 18th century was deeply political. It was heavily imbued with [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] principles and many of its philosophers became critics of church and state and promoters of rationality and progress. These philosophers would come to have a deep influence on the politics and ideologies of France and America.

'''[[Charles de Secondat, baron de Montesquieu]]''' (1689–1755) was a social commentator and political philosopher. His theories deeply influenced the [[Founding Fathers of the United States|American Founders]]. His belief that the state powers be separated into [[Legislature|legislative]], [[Executive (government)|executive]], and [[Judiciary|judicial]] branches formed the basis for [[separation of powers under the United States Constitution]]. In ''[[The Spirit of the Laws]]'', Montesquieu outlined the view that man and societies are influenced by climate. He believed that hotter climates create hot-tempered people and colder climates aloof people, whereas the mild climate of France is ideal for political systems. This theory may possibly have been influenced by similar sentiment expressed in ''[[Germania (book)|Germania]]'', an ethnographic writing by [[Tacitus]], a writer frequently studied by Montesquieu.

'''[[Voltaire]]''' (1694–1778) came to embody the Enlightenment with his criticisms of [[Church dogma]] and French institutions, his defence of civil liberties and his support of social reform. The civil liberties for which he fought were those of the right to a free trial and freedom of religion. He is best remembered for his aphorisms and his satire of [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] known as ''[[Candide]]'', which tells the tale of a young believer in [[Leibnizian]] [[optimism]] who becomes disillusioned after a series of hardships.

'''[[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]''' (1712–1778) distinguished himself from the progressive [[scientism]] of the Enlightenment with his proclamation in ''[[Discourse on the Arts and Sciences]]'' that art and science are corruptors of human morality. Furthermore, he caused controversy with his theory that man is good by nature but corrupted by society, which is a direct contradiction of the Christian doctrine of original sin. Some of his theories continue to be controversial, such as his idea called the [[general will]], which has been both accused of fascism and praised for its socialist ideals. Rousseau’s thought highly influenced the [[French Revolution]], his critique of private property has been seen as a forebear to [[Marxism|Marxist]] ideology, and his picture was the only one to grace the home of [[Immanuel Kant]]. He was so highly praised by the French revolutionists, that in 1794 his remains were moved to the [[Panthéon]] in Paris.

'''[[Denis Diderot]]''' (1713–1784) was a key collaborator in the creation of the ''[[Encyclopédie|Encyclopédia]]''. A systematic collection of all the information of the arts and sciences, the ''Encyclopédia'' caused great controversy. Diderot was harassed repeatedly by the police, and was even arrested. The ecclesiastical party disliked the ''Encyclopédia'', which was a threat to the aristocracy because it asserted that the state should take care of the people and not itself, religious freedom, freedom of thought and the value of science and industry. In the end, the bookseller began removing all articles he deemed controversial in fear of punishment. The ''Encyclopédia'' that Diderot had worked on for twenty years was ruined beyond repair.

== 19th century ==

=== Auguste Comte ===
[[Image:Auguste Comte.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Auguste Comte was the founder of sociology and positivism.]]
[[Auguste Comte]] (1798–1857) was a philosopher born in [[Montpellier]]. He was the founder of the discipline of [[sociology]] and the doctrine of [[positivism]], and may be regarded as the first [[philosophy of science|philosopher of science]] in the modern sense of the term.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/comte/ Michel Bourdeau – Auguste Comte]&lt;/ref&gt;

Strongly influenced by the [[Utopian socialist]], [[Henri de Saint-Simon]], Comte developed the positive philosophy in an attempt to remedy the social malaise of the [[French revolution]], calling for a new social paradigm based on the sciences. Comte offered an account of [[Social evolutionism|social evolution]], proposing that society undergoes three phases in its quest for the truth according to a general '[[law of three stages]]'. Comte's stages were (1) the ''theological'', (2) the ''metaphysical'', and (3) the ''positive''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Anthony Giddens]], [https://www.sussex.ac.uk/webteam/gateway/file.php?name=3positivism09&amp;site=12 "Positivism and Sociology"].&lt;/ref&gt;

Comte attempted to introduce a cohesive "[[religion of humanity]]" which, though largely unsuccessful, was influential in the development of various [[Secular Humanist]] organizations in the 19th century. He also created and defined the term "[[altruism]]".&lt;ref&gt;Oxford English Dictionary: altruism. 2nd ed. 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

Comte was of considerable influence in 19th century thought, impacting the work of thinkers such as [[Karl Marx]] and [[John Stuart Mill]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historyguide.org/intellect/lecture25a.html#course ''Lecture 25: The Age of Ideologies (3): The World of Auguste Comte''] The History Guide (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ferdinand de Saussure ===
[[Image:Ferdinand de Saussure.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Ferdinand de Saussure founded linguistics, semiotics and structuralism.]]

[[Ferdinand de Saussure]] (1857–1913) was a Swiss linguist who taught for many years in Paris. He was concerned with distinguishing linguistics from philology by moving from the study of the history of individual words and comparisons of languages to the study of the essential underlying structures of language. His small output of work, most of which was published posthumously, became the foundations of [[linguistics]], [[semiotics]] and [[structuralism]], the school of philosophy concerned with the underlying structures which form, limit and affect society, language and the human mind.

Saussure divided language into two parts: the ''langue'', which is the system of signs and rules owned by a community, and ''parole'', the individual acts of speech within the given community. This was likened by Saussure to chess and a game of chess, for before anyone can play, they have to know the rules and structure of the game.

For Saussure, the essential unit of any language is the word, or sign. Like language, he divides the word into two inseparable parts: the signifier, which is the sound image, and the signified, which is the concept associated with the signifier. Saussure stressed the arbitrariness of this association, maintaining that any signifier can refer to any signified. How a sign obtains its meaning is by what it is not within the langue, not what it is. For example, the word ‘dog’ means dog simply because it does not mean cat, bird or cornflakes.

It can already be seen clearly that language is highly dualistic for Saussure. Indeed, he maintained that man thought essentially in dichotomies. For Saussure, the way language can be studied is dualistic too. It can be studied synchronically, i.e. as a complete system within a frozen moment of time, or it can be studied diachronically, which is the examination of its historical development. It can be said that [[Structuralism|structuralists]] focussed on the synchronic aspects of culture, while [[Poststructuralism|poststructuralists]], as a reaction toward the highly dualistic and deterministic characteristics, focussed on the diachronic aspects of culture in an attempt to invoke a grey area.&lt;ref&gt;This section of the article references the Roy Harris translation of the book.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Henri Bergson ===
[[Image:Bergson-Nobel-photo.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Henri Bergson would play a major part in shaping 20th century thought.]]

While [[Ferdinand de Saussure]] was a relatively obscure thinker in his time, it may be said that [[Henri Bergson]] (1859–1941) was somewhat of a celebrity. His philosophy appealed both to academics and the general public from its first inception in 1889 to Bergson’s death in the early 20th century. Although a major influence on [[William James]], [[Alfred North Whitehead]], [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], [[Emmanuel Lévinas]], [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]] and the novelist [[Marcel Proust]], interest in his work greatly decreased after WW2. However, in the late 20th century, through the works of self-proclaimed Bergsonian [[Gilles Deleuze]] came a revitalization of interest in Henri Bergson’s oeuvre.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/bergson/ Stanford Encyclopaedia of Philosophy].&lt;/ref&gt;

All of Henri Bergson’s works were concerned with his theory of real time as it is experienced by [[consciousness]]. He came by the idea while trying to improve on the evolutionary philosophy of [[Herbert Spencer]], and has likened it to the rolling and unrolling of thread to represent man’s sense of mortality and the continual gain of new memory; a spectrum of a thousand shades with a current of feeling running through them, collecting and retaining them, to represent how all the moments are heterogeneous; and a piece of elastic contracted to a point and then drawn out indefinitely, producing a line which will progressively grow longer and longer, to represent pure, indivisible mobility. However, these images are insufficient and can only show the idea indirectly. The first is too homogeneous, the second is juxtaposed and complete whereas time is in a constant state of becoming, and the third forgets the heterogeneous nature of the idea. In fact, Bergson maintains that the case is the same for any other image of the idea one can produce.&lt;ref name=Creative_Mind&gt;Henri Bergson (1946), ''The Creative Mind: An Introduction to Metaphysics'', pages 159 to 200.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bergson calls this idea [[Duration (Bergson)|Duration]] and defines it as being qualitative, not quantitative, unextended, not extended, a multiplicity yet a unity, mobile and continuously interpenetrating itself. However, it should be warned that Bergson believes Duration cannot be represented by concepts either. Bergson calls the creation of concepts analysis and believes it can never represent the absolute. He likens it to constructing a model of a city out of a collection of photographs taken from every angle and a poem being translated and having commentary piled upon commentary: the model of the city can never replicate the feeling of being in the city itself and the translation and commentaries can never give the simple dimensional value of walking in the city itself. Indeed, symbols always distort the part of an object they represent through generalization to include it and every other objects’ part they represent.&lt;ref name="Creative_Mind"/&gt;

The Duration can only be grasped through [[Intuition (Bergson)|intuition]], the sympathy by which one is transported into an object to grasp what is unique and ineffable within it. Intuition is a complete philosophical method that involves placing oneself within the Duration, and expanding it into a continuous heterogeneity, differentiating the extremities within it to create a dualism, before showing them to in fact be one.&lt;ref name="Creative_Mind"/&gt; An example of this is Duration itself, which is neither a multiplicity or a unity. But depending on which point of view one recreates it from, one will either reconstruct it as a unity or a multiplicity. Hence [[Pluralism (philosophy)|substance pluralism]] and [[Monism|substance monism]] are in fact two representations of the same phenomenon.

== 20th century ==
{{Main|Twentieth-century French philosophy}}

[[Twentieth-century French philosophy|French philosophy in the 20th century]] saw the rise of many schools of thought. The [[philosophy of science]] with [[Jules Henri Poincare|Poincaré]], [[Gaston Bachelard|Bachelard]], [[Jean Cavailles|Cavaillès]] and [[Jules Vuillemin|Vuillemin]]. The phenomenology, presented in a Cartesian format and influenced by German thought, particularly the [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] of [[Edmund Husserl|Husserl]] and [[Martin Heidegger|Heidegger]]. Phenomenology was consistently noticeable throughout the 20th century, whereas [[existentialism]] spread throughout the west and gained fame, only to die out somewhat with the advent of [[structuralism]], which came to be seen as merely a necessary means of access to [[post-structuralism]], while [[postmodern philosophy|postmodern thought]] came to dominate the late 20th century.

[[File:Jules Vuillemin - Philippe Binant Archives.jpg|thumb|Jules Vuillemin would play a major part in philosophy of science and philosophy of knowledge.]]

[[Philosophy of science]] is a branch of [[philosophy]] concerned with the foundations, methods,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|author= Gargani Julien|title=Voyage aux marges du savoir : ethno-sociologie de la connaissance|publisher=L’Harmattan|year=2011|page=168
|url=http://www.editions-harmattan.fr/index.asp?navig=catalogue&amp;obj=livre&amp;no=34153}}&lt;/ref&gt; and implications of [[science]]. The central questions of this study concern [[Demarcation problem|what qualifies as science]], the reliability of scientific theories, and the ultimate purpose of science. In France, philosophy of science (also known as &lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;'''French historical epistemology'''&lt;ref&gt;José Lopez, ''Society and Its Metaphors: Language, Social Theory and Social Structure'', Bloomsbury Academic, 2003, p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;E. Reck (ed.), ''The Historical Turn in Analytic Philosophy'', Springer, 2016: ch. 2.1.&lt;/ref&gt; or &lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;'''French epistemology'''&lt;ref&gt;''Conversations on Science, Culture, and Time: Michel Serres Interviewed by [[Bruno Latour]]'', University of Michigan Press, 1995, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;) was a prominent school of thought with [[Jules Henri Poincare|Poincaré]], [[Gaston Bachelard|Bachelard]], [[Jean Cavaillès|Cavaillès]] and [[Jules Vuillemin|Vuillemin]].

'''[[Henri Poincaré]]''' (1854–1912) had philosophical views opposite to those of [[Bertrand Russell]] and [[Gottlob Frege]], who believed that mathematics was a branch of [[logic]]. Poincaré strongly disagreed, claiming that [[intuition (knowledge)|intuition]] was the life of mathematics; he gives an interesting point of view in his book ''[[Science and Hypothesis]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|author= Gargani Julien|title=Poincaré, le hasard et l’étude des systèmes complexes|publisher=L’Harmattan|year=2012|page=124
|url=http://www.editions-harmattan.fr/index.asp?navig=catalogue&amp;obj=livre&amp;no=38754}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Gaston Bachelard]]''' (1884–1962) introduced the concepts of ''epistemological obstacle'' and ''[[Epistemological rupture|epistemological break]]'' (''obstacle épistémologique'' and ''rupture épistémologique'').

'''[[Jean Cavaillès]]''' (1903–1944), was specialized in philosophy of science concerned with the axiomatic method, formalism, [[set theory]] and mathematical logic.

'''[[Jules Vuillemin]]''' (1920–2001) introduced the concept of the ''philosophy of [[algebra]]'' and was specialized in [[Epistemology|philosophy of knowledge]].

=== Phenomenology ===

[[Phenomenology (philosophy)|Phenomenology]] can be defined as a way of philosophizing which involves descriptive explanations of phenomena as it is given to consciousness and how it is given to consciousness, which attempts to avoid imposed explanations. In France, phenomenology was seen as a radical Cartesianism which rejected [[substance dualism]] to better understand transcendental consciousness. It played a major role in existentialism and many postmodern philosophers' thought, such as [[Gilles Deleuze]] and [[Jacques Derrida]], who actually began his career with a deep, critical study of [[Edmund Husserl]]. Phenomenology is still an important area of research in France today.&lt;ref name=Introduction_Phenomenology&gt;Dermot Moran, ''Introduction to Phenomenology''.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Emmanuel Lévinas]]''' (1906–1995) was one of the first to introduce phenomenology to France, through his translation of Edmund Husserl’s ''[[Cartesian Meditations]]''. Lévinas considered [[ethics]] primary in philosophy and once proclaimed that it precedes metaphysics and should be considered the first philosophy. He developed a moral philosophy based around notions of the [[Other (philosophy)|other]] and the [[face-to-face (philosophy)|face]] which introduced ethics into phenomenology, which had been missing since the demise of [[Max Scheler]].&lt;ref name="Introduction_Phenomenology"/&gt;

'''[[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]]''' (1908–1961) was concerned with the foundations of perception. His theory of the subject-body was produced as an alternative to [[René Descartes|René Descartes']] [[Cogito Ergo Sum|Cogito]] and [[substance dualism]]. In contrast to the clear distinction between the mind and the external world, where the latter is but an extension of the former, the subject-body is an existential account of the pre-reflective subject, the subject's perception and the world as intricately intertwined.

'''[[Paul Ricœur]]''' (1913–2005) was one of the first to introduce phenomenology to France. He was best known for combining [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenological]] description with [[hermeneutics]]. He was awarded the Kyoto prize in arts and philosophy for having "revolutionized the methods of hermeneutic phenomenology, expanding the study of textual interpretation to include the broad yet concrete domains of mythology, biblical exegesis, psychoanalysis, theory of metaphor, and narrative theory.

=== Existentialism ===

[[Existentialism]] was a prominent school of thought in the first half of the 20th century. Traditionally, existentialism is concerned with the human condition, exploring such topics as purpose, freedom and the experience of the other. It can trace its roots back to philosophers such as [[Søren Kierkegaard]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] and [[Martin Heidegger]], as well as [[Lebensphilosophie]], but bloomed with the thought of French phenomenologist [[Jean-Paul Sartre]].

'''[[Jean-Paul Sartre]]''' (1905–1980) defined his existentialism as drawing all the conclusions from a consistent line of atheism. His major thesis is that existence precedes essence. With an immaterial object, such as a knife, an artisan devises an essence, such as that of slicing bread, and then produces an object whose purpose it is to fulfil its essence. However, without God, there is no artisan who developed the essence of man in a teleological sense. So first man is born free, thrown into the world where sole responsibility for his actions rests on his shoulders, then through his actions he defines the essence of not only himself, but of what he believes man ought to be. The denial of this responsibility through excuses is what Sartre termed [[bad faith (existentialism)|bad faith]]. Jean-Paul Sartre was a spokesman for a generation, but his influence waned with the advent of structuralism.&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Paul Sartre, ''Existentialism is a Humanism''.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Albert Camus]]''' (1913–1960) rejected being labelled an existentialist, preferring to be called an [[Absurdism|absurdist]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Les Nouvelles littéraires]]'', November 15, 1945.&lt;/ref&gt; In the opening pages of ''[[The Myth of Sisyphus]]'', he states what he considers to be the fundamental question of philosophy: is suicide the correct response to an absurd world? Likening a Godless life to the story of [[Sisyphus]], where he is doomed forever to push a rock up a hill only for it to roll down again, Camus’ answer is "No. It requires revolt. […] The struggle itself is enough to fill a man’s heart. One must imagine Sisyphus happy."&lt;ref&gt;Albert Camus, ''The Myth of Sisyphus''.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Simone de Beauvoir]]''' (1908–1986) was an existential [[feminism|feminist]]. Beauvoir believed that through surrounding women in a false aura of mystery, man had turned her into "the other". Furthermore, she proclaimed women were stereotyped by this aura and that it was used by man as an excuse for not understanding them and dominating them. "The other" is always the underclass. But Beauvoir maintains that Sartre’s thesis (that is, existence precedes essence) applies to women as much as it does to men and that through their choices and actions, women can transcend this aura and reject being the underclass.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

=== Structuralism ===

As previously mentioned, French [[Structuralism]] is primarily concerned with the underlying structures which form, limit and affect society, language and the human mind. It finds its roots in the thought of [[Ferdinand de Saussure]], who was concerned with [[linguistics]]. But soon structuralism began to be applied to [[anthropology]], [[social sciences]] and [[psychology]]. Structuralism played a major role in intellectual thought after World War Two, where it rejected existential concepts of freedom for the idea of man as determined by structures in the thought of such thinkers as [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]] and [[Jacques Lacan]]. However, by the end of the century it became perceived as important not for itself, but for the schools of thought it produced, such as [[poststructuralism]] and [[deconstruction]].

'''[[Claude Lévi-Strauss]]''' (1908–2009) applied Saussure’s structuralism to anthropology, perhaps most famously to the dreams of tribes.

'''[[Roland Barthes]]''' (1915–1980) was a literary critic and semiologist who applied Saussure’s thought to literary theory. In ''[[Mythologies (book)|Mythologies]]'', Barthes explored articles, advertisements, movies, etc. to demonstrate the deep-seated bourgeois propaganda found within. He described these myths as second-order signs. A certain form of green bottles signify red wine. The bourgeois then  assign a second signifier to this signifier, that of relaxing, healthy, strong wine, be it to sell products or uphold the status quo.

'''[[Jacques Lacan]]''' (1901–1981) was a psychoanalyst who sought to explain the mind in terms of structures both in order to correct perceived errors in [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]]’s thought as well as errors in the subsequent interpretation of Freud through the theories of Saussure, Strauss and Barthes. Lacan was also influenced by German philosophers [[G. W. F. Hegel]] and [[Martin Heidegger]] through [[Alexandre Kojève]]'s lectures on Hegel's ''[[Phenomenology of Spirit]]''.

'''[[Louis Althusser]]''' (1918–1990) and his colleagues, prominently including [[Étienne Balibar]], reworked Marxism using insights from structuralism, against the so-called "humanist" trend in Sartrean and [[Western Marxism]]s.  Althusser offered an influential new reading of Marx's work, describing an "epistemological break" between the young, Hegelian Marx and the late Marx of ''[[Das Kapital]]''.  With his focus on the economic level and theory, Althusser came into conflict with social historians, such as [[E. P. Thompson]].

=== Poststructuralism and postmodernism===
[[Image:Jean-Francois Lyotard.jpg|thumb|right|[[Jean-François Lyotard]] defined postmodernism as incredulity toward [[metanarratives]]. Photograph by [[Bracha L. Ettinger]], 1995.]]

The second half of the 20th century saw the rise of so-called [[postmodern philosophy|postmodern thought]]. This rise was especially noticeable in France. However, the term is fairly hard to define. In fact, some people maintain that it is nothing but a slur applied to a group of disparate philosophers wrongly grouped together. However, it can also be seen as a critique of traditional western thought, particularly dichotomies and the belief in progress, influenced heavily by [[structuralism]], [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] and [[existentialism]].

'''[[Jean-François Lyotard]]''' (1924–1998) defined postmodernism as scepticism toward [[metanarratives]]. A metanarrative is a kind of grand arching story that encompasses - and claims to predict - everything. An example is [[Marxism]], which explains the communist as the inevitable historical synthesis of the proletariat and capitalist of modern capitalist class division. Lyotard considered the metanarrative an essential feature of modernity. Hence the postmodern condition is the replacement of metanarratives with a multiplicity of micro-narratives, or to call them the appellation Lyotard gave them, [[language games]]. Lyotard maintained that these language games lack any all-embracing structure but were brought about by technological developments in such fields as communication and mass media making metanarratives indefensible.&lt;ref&gt;Jean-François Lyotard, ''The Postmodern Condition''.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Michel Foucault]]''' (1926–1984) maintained a similar scepticism about absolutes, such as right and wrong, sane and insane, and human nature. His method was not to deny such notions, but to historicize them, examining what in the supposedly necessary may be contingent, and demonstrating the relationships between knowledge and politics, power and knowledge. His main fields of investigation were psychiatry, medicine and disciplinary institutions. Foucault was anti-Hegelian and anti-teleological in his historical excavations. Through his examinations of psychiatry in ''[[Madness and Civilization]]'', he showed that the development of psychiatry was not an obvious improvement on previous treatments of the insane, and that furthermore, the apparent scientific neutrality of psychiatric treatments hides the fact that they are a form of controlling defiance of bourgeois society.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/foucault/ Stanford Encyclopaedia of Philosophy].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Jacques Derrida]]''' (1930–2004) developed [[deconstruction]] as a response to [[structuralism]]. Deconstruction takes a text, examines binary oppositions within it from several different interpreting standpoints, and then attempts to show them to be dependent upon one another, unstable, ambiguous and historically and culturally defined. Through showing the fluidity of the dichotomies, deconstruction shows the fluidity of the text. Derrida maintained that no meaning is stable, not even the dichotomies classical philosophers took for granted. Through an internal logic, the text deconstructs itself and hence allows highly original interpretations.

'''[[Jean Baudrillard]]''' (1929–2007)  was concerned with the concealment of the fact that there are no truths in a given field. He termed this concealment [[simulacra]]. An example he gives is the [[Jorge Luis Borges|Borges]] story of an Empire that creates a map which was so accurate that it laid over and covered the entire city it mapped. The map grew when the Empire grew, and decayed when the empire decayed. When the empire was destroyed, the only object left was the map. For Baudrillard, people live in the map and hence reality crumbles because of misuse.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Baudrillard, ''Simulacra and Simulation''.&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, the difference between reality and illusion becomes indistinguishable for the consciousness. Baudrillard called this [[hyperreality]]. An example of this is reality television, which is dependent on the watcher embracing it to create the illusion that it mirrors reality.

'''[[Gilles Deleuze]]''' (1925–1995) developed a philosophy of difference which valued the simulacrum higher than the idea and its copy, which is an inversion of Plato’s method, which held the idea and its copy in high esteem and neglected the [[simulacrum]]. He saw difference as prior to identity and reason as not all-encompassing, but a little haven built in the duration of difference-in-itself. He likened it to Christianity, where if you accept original sin and immaculate conception, then it all makes sense. Deleuze also developed a constructivist view of philosophy as the job of developing concepts, just like it is the poet’s job to produce poems and the painter’s job to paint paintings. For these reasons, Deleuze developed an idiosyncratic way of reading philosophers which he once referred to as buggery. He would use them as stepping stones for creating new concepts which appear to belong to the philosopher he’s reading, but are utterly different. An example is that of [[Spinoza]], whom Deleuze read as an empiricist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iep.utm.edu/d/deleuze.htm Gilles Deleuze (1925–1995) – The Internet Encyclopaedia of Philosophy].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Hélène Cixous]]''' (born 1937) developed a feminist interpretation of post-structuralism most influenced by Derrida. She argued that patriarchal cultures build male domination into their language and literary canon, and that a feminist revolution must account for this. She urged female writers to adopt deconstructionist methods and forward their own vision of life as a woman.

'''German Ethics Council''' ({{lang-de|Deutscher Ethikrat}}) (Precursor from June 2001 to February 2008: '''National Ethics Council''') is an independent council of experts in [[Germany]] working on the [[ethical]], social, scientific, medical, and legal issues and their consequences for the individuals and the society. Half of the 26 members are proposed by the [[Cabinet of Germany]] including the [[Chancellor of Germany|chancellor]], while the other half of the 26 members is proposed by the [[Bundestag]]. The members of the German Ethics Council are then designated by the [[President of the Bundestag]]. 

It is host of the [https://www.globalsummit-berlin2016.de 2016 Global Summit of National Ethics/Bioethics Councils in Berlin] under the Presidency of 2012-2016 Chair [[Christiane Woopen|Prof. Dr. Christiane Woopen]] of [[University of Cologne|Cologne University]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8590">[[File:Versailles Palace.jpg|thumb|300px|The Palace of Versailles where the formal presentations for ladies took place]]

The '''Honneurs de la Cour''' ('''Honors of the Court''') were ceremonious presentations to the sovereign at the [[Palace of Versailles|Royal Court of France]] that were formal for women but more casual for men. It was an honour granted only to the families of [[Noblesse d'épée|ancient nobility]]. It allowed them to approach the [[King of France|King]] and the [[Queen of France|Queen]] of France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.isgn.fr/autres/img358a.pdf |title=Notice historique sur les honneurs de la Cour |language=French |publisher=Institution Saint Georges pour la Noblesse |quote=...''(etre admis aux) honneurs de la Cour, c'est-a-dire aux cercles, aux receptions, aux bals du Roi et de la Reine, pour monter dans les carrosses de Sa majeste et l'accompagner a la chasse''; in English: ''[the Honors of the Court meant] to be allow to attend the circles, receptions and balls of the King and the Queen, to get into His Majesty's carriages and to go hunting with the King''. |year=2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721001229/http://www.isgn.fr/autres/img358a.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The Honors of the Court "were the most prestigious noble honour of the 18th century, meant to honour the most ancient and representing noble families".&lt;ref name="Valette"&gt;Régis Valette, ''Catalogue de la noblesse française au XXIe siècle'', éd. Robert Laffont, Paris, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Formally such presentations were only granted to noble families able to prove a lineage dating back to 1400 A.D. without tracks of ennoblement. However, the king could grant exemptions to families that had been dedicated to serve him. He could also refuse a valid candidate with sufficient nobility whose family was not involved enough in the king's wars as nobles were primarily mounted warriors who had sworn allegiance to their sovereign and promised to fight for him. On a list of candidates he would then place a remark next to the name of the refused applicant saying "ne se peut" (can't be) or "attendre" (wait).

The Honors of the Court should not be mistaken for court life. The oldest nobility did not always match the court nobility. Many families living at court were descendants from [[Noblesse de robe|less ancient nobility]] while many nobles of [[Noblesse d'épée|antique nobility]] did not stay at court. Moreover, life at the Versailles Court was expensive and many were unable to afford it.

The nobleman who was granted the presentation would follow a royal hunt on board of one of the king's carriages. At that point he would be casually introduced to the king. A noblewoman's presentation was much more formal, taking place during a specific ceremony.

From 1715 to 1790,&lt;ref&gt;The ''Honneurs'' were codified in 1715 (the first year of [[Louis XV]]'s reign), there were no more presentation after the [[French Revolution|fall of the monarchy]] in 1790.&lt;/ref&gt; 942 families were granted the Honors of the Court; 880 of them were French. François Bluche, who studied the royal genealogical archives, said that among the 942 families "462 were able to prove a noble lineage dating back to 1400, if excluding sovereign houses and foreign nobles who, unlike one can think, made up more than half of the French nobleman received at Court".&lt;ref name="Bluche"&gt;{{cite magazine|first=François |last=Bluche |title=Les Honneurs de la Cour |location=Paris | series=Les Cahiers nobles |date=1957 |magazine=[[L'intermédiaire des Chercheurs et des Curieux]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has limited his work to a list of 43 [[Noble family|Houses]] especially flattered by the King's archive, these 43 families are considered of major regional or national importance and members of the highest 18th century nobility. 

According to Régis Valette&lt;ref name="Valette"/&gt; only 280 of the 880 French families who were granted the Honors of the Court still remain today.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4618">[[File:Honorio Delgado.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Honorio Delgado (1892-1969)]]
'''Honorio Delgado Espinosa''' (born [[Arequipa]], 26 September 1892 - died [[Lima]], 28 November 1969) was a gifted teacher, a creative researcher, a humanist, a philosopher, a linguist, and scholar whose work covered almost 50 years of the 20th-century history of Latin American psychiatry.  Born in Arequipa, [[Peru]], Dr. Delgado graduated from Lima’s Universidad de San Marcos.

==Biography==

The early part of Dr. Delgado’s career was marked by an enthusiastic adherence to [[Sigmund Freud]]’s psychoanalytic principles and included a frequent correspondence with the founder of psychoanalysis that extended until the late 1930s, long after Dr. Delgado had distanced himself ideologically from Freud. By the mid-1930s, Dr. Delgado had developed a major interest in phenomenology.  He also systematically pioneered biological innovations in the treatment of psychiatric disorders. For instance, he introduced the use of sodium nucleinate in the management of psychotic agitation in 1917 and the use of phenobarbital for the control of seizures in 1919. He was also the first in Latin America to apply malaria therapy in the treatment of general paresis and the use of chlorpromazine in the treatment of schizophrenia.  In 1957, he was one of the co-founders of the prestigious Collegium Internationale Neuro-Psychopharmacologicum in Zurich.

Dr. Delgado was a member of the exclusive [[Real Academia Española]], headquartered in [[Madrid]]. He authored more than 450 articles and two dozen books on topics such as personality and character, the rehumanization of scientific culture, the spiritual formation of the individual, and ecology and existentialism. He co-founded, in 1918, the first psychiatric journal in Latin America, Revista de Psiquiatria y Disciplinas Conexas, the predecessor of the contemporary Revista de Psiquiatria. In 1953, he published a textbook of psychiatry that ultimately produced seven editions.

As Chairman of the Department of Psychiatry at San Marcos University for almost 30 years, Dr. Delgado recruited and mentored a group of very talented academicians and researchers that came to be known across Latin America as the Peruvian School of Psychiatry. One of his most notable contributions to the field of psychopathology was the description of three fundamental concepts in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia: the disjunction between the inner and outer world of the patient (autism), the disjunction of the ego with respect to the content of consciousness, and the breakdown of basic categories of knowledge. He also anticipated the crucial role of attention and cognition in the phenomenology of schizophrenia, a process that he called atelesis, or the failure in the intentionality of thought (1). However, Dr. Delgado’s most visionary contribution was his anticipation of the development of the current psychiatric nomenclature, represented by the DSM series. Since the early 1950s, he had advocated the use of accurate descriptive diagnostic criteria, free of ideological biases and based on a multifactorial causality, with appropriate recognition of the biological basis of mental illness and of the hierarchization of descriptive criteria. At the same time, he emphasized the need for research to demonstrate diagnostic validity and for the recognition of different level of operations of the human psyche.

Dr. Delgado’s objective and critical approach to psychiatry and psychopathology, his integrative and humanistic approach to treatment, and his clinical/academic scope and strict technical conceptualization of scientific terminology were paralleled only by his legendary teaching abilities and the respect he has earned from generations of Latin American psychiatrists. His legacy goes beyond the borders of Latin America to join those of psychiatric leaders across the world.

Born in [[Edinburgh]] on 27 March 1673, he was the younger brother of [[John Keill]], and the nephew of [[William Cockburn (physician)|William Cockburn]]. James father was Robert Keill who was an Edinburgh lawyer. His mother was Sarah Cockburn.  He was educated partly at home, studying under [[Andrew Massey (philosopher)|Andrew Massey]] and (probably) [[David Gregory (mathematician)|David Gregory]] at [[Edinburgh University]], and partly on the continent, studying under [[Nicolas Lemery]] and (probably) [[Jean Guichard Duverney]] in [[Paris University|Paris]], followed by a period at [[Leyden University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Valadez|first=F M|author2=C D O'Malley|date=October 1971|title=James Keill of Northampton, physician, anatomist and physiologist|journal=Medical History|volume=15|issue=4|pages=317–335|pmc=1034193|pmid=4945332|doi=10.1017/s0025727300016884}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He applied himself to [[anatomy]], and, moving to England, acquired a reputation by lecturing on anatomy at [[Oxford]] and [[Cambridge]] (which conferred on him the degree of M.D.&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=KL705J|name=Keil, James}}&lt;/ref&gt;) With the degree, but without belonging to the [[College of Physicians]], he settled in 1703 as a physician at [[Northampton]], where he continued for the rest of his life. He was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] in 1712.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://collections.royalsociety.org/DServe.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&amp;dsqApp=Archive&amp;dsqCmd=Show.tcl&amp;dsqDb=Persons&amp;dsqPos=3&amp;dsqSearch=%28%28text%29%3D%27keill%27%29|title=Fellow details|publisher= Royal Society|accessdate= 24 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He died unmarried on 16 July 1719 of a cancer of the mouth, and was buried in St. Giles's Church, Northampton, where a monument, with a Latin inscription, was erected to his memory by his brother John.

==Works==

He was an active supporter of the mechanical or ‘iatro-mathematical’ school of medicine; some of his ideas derived from his brother, a mathematician. He discussed by mathematical methods, combined with experiment, several physiological problems, such as [[secretion]], the amount of blood in the body, muscular motion, and the force of the heart. On the latter point he corrected an exaggerated estimate of [[Giovanni Alfonso Borelli]]; but his own results were not satisfactory, and were criticised by [[James Jurin]] in the ''[[Philosophical Transactions]]''. Keill's essays were, however, esteemed. He also made a series of physiological observations on himself, after the manner of [[Santorio Sanctorius]], published as ‘Medicina statica Britannica,’ in the third edition of his essays.

Keill's major work appeared first as ‘An Account of Animal Secretion, the Quantity of Blood in the Humane Body, and Muscular Motion,’ London, 1708; 2nd edit. enlarged under the new title of ‘Essays on several Parts of the Animal Œconomy,’ London, 1717; 3rd edit. (Latin), ‘Tentamina Medico-Physica, &amp;c. Quibus accessit Medicina statica Britannica,’ London, 1718; 4th edit., containing in addition ‘A Dissertation concerning the Force of the Heart, by James Jurin, M.D., with Dr. Keill's Answer and Dr. Jurin's Reply; also Medicina statica Britannica, &amp;c., explained and compared with the Aphorisms of Sanctorius, by [[John Quincy (medical writer)|John Quincy]], M.D.,’ London, 1738. He wrote also ‘The Anatomy of the Human Body, abridged,’ London, 1698, 15th edit. 1771; ‘An Account of the Death and Dissection of John Bayles of Northampton, reputed to have been 130 years old’ (Phil. Trans. 1706, xxv. 2247); and ‘De Viribus Cordis’ (ib. 1719, xxx. 995).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3766">'''Kristian Birch-Reichenwald Aars''' (25 September 1868 – 4 August 1917) was a Norwegian academic. Originally educated as a [[theology|theologian]], he soon switched to [[philosophy]] and [[psychology]].

==Personal life==
He was born in [[Oslo|Christiania]] as a son of educator [[Jacob Jonathan Aars]] (1837–1908) and his wife Anna Ernesta Birch-Reichenwald (1838–1919).He was the brother of architect [[Harald Aars]], and a grandson of [[Christian Birch-Reichenwald]].&lt;ref name=nbl&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Kristian Aars|encyclopedia=[[Norsk biografisk leksikon]]|publisher=Aschehoug|location=Oslo|editor=[[Knut Helle|Helle, Knut]]|first=Håkon|last=Korsvold|year=2005|volume=10|url=http://www.snl.no/.nbl_biografi/Kristian_Aars/utdypning|accessdate=31 March 2009|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also a grandnephew of priest and politician [[Jens Aars]] and a second cousin of writer [[Sophus Christian Munk Aars]].&lt;ref name=snl&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|year=2007|title=Aars – slekt|encyclopedia=[[Store norske leksikon]]|first=Terje|last=Bratberg|editor=Henriksen, Petter|publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget|location=Oslo|url=http://www.snl.no/Aars/slekt|language=Norwegian|accessdate=31 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1895 and 1910 he was married to Marna Aall (1873–1948). During that time he was a brother-in-law of [[Anathon Aall]] and [[Herman Harris Aall]]. Anathon Aall biographed him in the first volume of the first edition of the [[biographical dictionary]] ''[[Norsk biografisk leksikon]]''.&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt; In a later marriage, Marna Aall became mother-in-law of astronomer [[Rolf Brahde]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|year=|title=Rolf Brahde|encyclopedia=[[Norsk biografisk leksikon]]|first=Oddbjørn|last=Engvold|authorlink=Oddbjørn Engvold|volume=|editor=[[Knut Helle|Helle, Knut]]|publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget|location=Oslo|url=http://www.snl.no/.nbl_biografi/Rolf_Brahde/utdypning|language=Norwegian|accessdate=23 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Aars [[examen artium|finished]] his secondary education in 1887, and graduated from the [[University of Oslo|Royal Frederick University]] with the degree [[cand.theol.]] in 1892. After completing his education in theology, he shifted to philosophy. He studied abroad from 1894, and was a [[research assistant]] under [[Götz Martius]] and [[Angelo Mosso]]. He took the dr.philos. degree in 1897 with the thesis ''Die Autonomie der Moral'', and in the next year he was elected as a member of the [[Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters]]. From 1900 to 1914 he was a [[research fellow]] at the Royal Frederick University. His main works were ''Zur psychologischen Analyse der Welt. Projektionsphilosophie'' (1900) and ''Gut und Böse. Zur Psychologie der Moralgefühle'' (1907), both written in the [[German language]].&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt;

He did not only hold lectures in philosophy, but also in [[experimental psychology]] and [[epistemology]]. He saw knowledge in experimental psychology as a precondition for research in philosophy. He requested the establishment of a Department of Psychology at the Royal Frederick University,&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt; but it took more than ten years before this wish materialized. The person behind the new Department was Anathon Aall, who headed it until 1937.&lt;ref name="nbl"/&gt;

Aars struggled with heavy [[asthma]] for much of his life. He died in August 1917 in Kristiania.&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt;

[[File:Lubov_Axelrod.jpg|thumb|Lyubov Axelrod, 1887.]]
'''Lyubov Isaakovna Axelrod''' (born '''Esther Axelrod'''; {{lang-ru|Любо́вь (Эмтер) Исаа́ковна Аксельро́д}}, penname '''Orthodox''' {{lang-ru|Ортодо́кс}}; 1868–1946) was a [[Russia]]n revolutionary, [[Marxist]] [[philosopher]] and an art theoretician.

Axelrod was born in the family of a [[rabbi]] in [[Pastavy Raion|Vilenkovichi]], a village in the [[Vilna]] [[gubernia]] of the [[Russian Empire]], now in [[Pastavy Raion]], [[Belarus]]. She became involved with the [[narodnik]] organization at age 16 and took part in unsuccessful attempts to assassinate [[Alexander III of Russia]]. In 1887 she emigrated to [[Switzerland]] and received her [[Ph.D.]] in [[philosophy]] from [[Bern]] University in 1900.

In 1892 she became a Marxist and joined the [[Geneva]]-based [[Emancipation of Labor]] group, becoming a close associate of its leader [[Georgi Plekhanov]]. When the [[Russian Social Democratic Labor Party]] split into [[Bolsheviks]] and [[Mensheviks]] at its Second Congress in 1903, she sided with the Menshevik faction.

In 1906 Axelrod returned to Russia and became a leading Russian authority on Marxist philosophy, second only to Plekhanov. She was critical of both [[Alexander Bogdanov]] and [[Vladimir Lenin]] during their debate over [[Empiriocriticism]] in 1908-1909, branding their ideas anti-Marxist.

In the 1920s she first worked at the [[Institute of Red Professors]] and later at the Soviet Institute of Philosophy. In the 1930s her version of Marxism was officially denounced as a ''Mechanistic revision of Marxism'' and she faded into obscurity.

She died on 5 February 1946 in Moscow.

===Studies in the United States===

In the United States, Khan gradually lost interest in [[electrical engineering]] and began studies in advanced physics.&lt;ref name=AuthorHouse /&gt; In 1953, he moved to [[Chicago]] and began taking interests in [[thermodynamics]] and began post-graduate work on [[Kinetic theory of gases|kinetic theory]] of gases at the [[Illinois Institute of Technology]] which continued until 1956 during which time he also received preliminary training in atomic energy.&lt;ref name=AuthorHouse /&gt; By 1956, he was selected for the [[Atoms for Peace]] initiatives and participated in the Nuclear Engineering training program at the [[North Carolina State University]] while continued his research on nuclear power sources at the [[Argonne National Laboratory]], Illinois.&lt;ref name="Ishtiaq Ahmad"&gt;{{cite web  | last =Ahmad   | first =Ishtiaq  | authorlink =  | title =Remembering Munir Ahmad Khan | publisher =Ishtiaq Ahmad   | date = 21 April 2006  | url =http://www.ishtiaqahmad.com/item_display.aspx?listing_id=562&amp;listing_type=1   | doi =  | accessdate =2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Years VIC 1999 pp. 24"&gt;20 Years VIC (1979–1999), ECHO, Journal of the IAEA Staff- No. 202, pp. 24–25&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1957, he completed his program and earned a [[Master of Science]] in [[nuclear engineering]].&lt;ref name="Ishtiaq Ahmad"/&gt; He was part of the third batch of [[North Carolina State University|NCSU]]'s graduates who had specialized in reactor physics and nuclear engineering.&lt;ref name="Ishtiaq Ahmad"/&gt; The major part of his research in [[nuclear reactor]]s was carried out at the [[Argonne National Laboratory]] operated by the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|USAEC]] and the [[University of Chicago]], the site of the first self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction in 1942.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ishtiaq Ahmad"/&gt;

==Early professional work==
While at the [[Illinois Institute of Technology]], Khan was awarded [[Sigma Xi|Sigma-Xi]] fellowship in recognition of his research work. His early professional work was with the [[Wisconsin]]-based [[Allis-Chalmers]] where he worked as a [[Systems engineering|system engineer]] for a short time before joining the [[Commonwealth Edison]] in [[Chicago]].&lt;ref name="Munir Khan Passes Away 1999"/&gt;  It was during his work with [[Allis-Chalmers]] that Khan began taking interests in [[nuclear physics]] due to [[Allis-Chalmers|company's]] background on [[nuclear technology]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; During [[World War II]], the [[Allis-Chalmers]] was a sub-contractor and manufacturer of pumps and equipment for the ''[[K-25]]'' [[gaseous diffusion]] [[uranium enrichment]] plant, at [[Oak Ridge, Tennessee]] for the [[Manhattan Project]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

At [[Commonwealth Edison]], Khan's work took place working on a project on building the [[Experimental Breeder Reactor I|EBR-I]]– the world's first commercial nuclear power plant.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; All of early professional work took involved working in nuclear project, which lead Khan to enrolled at the nuclear engineering program of the [[North Carolina State University|NCSU]]&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Munir Ahmad Khan Interview with Urdu Digest, October 1981.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1957, Khan served as a Resident Research Associate in the [[Nuclear Engineering]] Division of the Argonne National Laboratory where he worked as a reactor design engineer on "Modifications of [[Chicago Pile 5|CP-5]] reactor." He then served in the Reactor Division of the American Machine Foundry Company, AMF Atomics, where he worked on the "Thermodynamic Design of Japan Research Reactor-2" till 1958.&lt;ref name="Years VIC 1999 pp. 24"/&gt;

===International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)===

After graduating in [[nuclear engineering]] from the [[United States]], Khan was offered to join the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] (IAEA) in 1958, becoming a staff member in Professional Grade P-5. Eventually, he joined the IAEA's Nuclear power division and was the first Asian member from any [[developing country]] who was appointed at a senior technical position in the IAEA. In 1958, Khan joined the [[Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission]] (PAEC) technical branch, serving at the advisory board.&lt;ref name="Nust Science Society" /&gt; At IAEA, he earned the nickname as the "''Reactor Khan'',&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Years VIC 1999 pp. 24"/&gt; and began assisting Pakistan at IAEA on nuclear issues.&lt;ref name="Nust Science Society" /&gt;

By 1961, he was a senior officer responsible for [[Nuclear Reactor Technology|reactor technology]] at the Reactor Division of the IAEA, and from 1968, Khan was now heading the IAEA's Reactor Division till 1972.

His major responsibilities as head of IAEA's Reactor Division included developing and implementing programs in the field of research in [[Utilization factor|reactor utilization]] in nuclear centers,&lt;ref name="iaea.org"/&gt; technical and economic assessment of [[nuclear power]] reactors, world survey of nuclear [[power plants]] for developing countries, construction and operating experience with nuclear stations, [[fast breeder reactor]]s and [[combined heat and power|nuclear desalination]].&lt;ref name="iaea.org"&gt;{{Cite journal

Hamende of the International Center for Theoretical Physics (ICTP)"/&gt; During 1967, he and Salam prepared a proposal for setting up a nuclear fuel and plutonium reprocessing plant in Pakistan, which was deferred by President Field Marshal [[Ayub Khan (Field Marshal)|Ayub Khan]] on [[economic]] grounds.&lt;ref&gt;Munir Ahmad Khan, "''Salam Passes into History''", The News (Islamabad), 24 November 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

In fact, Khan was the first person at the IAEA who was consulted by Abdus Salam in September 1960 about the establishment of the [[International Centre for Theoretical Physics]] (ICTP), [[Trieste]].&lt;ref name="users.ictp.it"&gt;http://users.ictp.it/~sci_info/News_from_ICTP/News_89/monitor.html. Retrieved 6 August 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Khan played a very important role in the establishment of the ICTP by way of securing the support of the IAEA the cause.&lt;ref name="AuthorHouse"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gill|first=Mohammad Akram|title=Modernity and the Muslim world|year=2006|publisher=AuthorHouse|location=Bloomington, IN|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Fbw3m4Ay45cC&amp;pg=PA110&amp;lpg=PA110&amp;dq=Munir+Ahmad+Khan+ICTP#v=onepage&amp;q=Munir%20Ahmad%20Khan%20ICTP&amp;f=false|chapter=Founder of the International Center for Theoretical Physics (ICTP)|isbn=978-1-4259-5671-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Khan, Nobel laureate [[Isidor Isaac Rabi|Isidor Rabi]] and [[Homi J. Bhabha|Homi Bhabha]], members of the scientific advisory committee of IAEA, [[Unanimous decision|unanimously]] opposed the establishment of ICTP.&lt;ref name="AuthorHouse"/&gt; Privately, Bhabha wanted to establish the ICTP in Mumbai, but Salam refused.&lt;ref name="AuthorHouse"/&gt; Therefore, Khan teamed up with Salam and established the ICTP in Italy, despite many initiatives taken against it.&lt;ref name="AuthorHouse"/&gt; Following the same tradition, in 1976, Abdus Salam and Munir Khan established the [[International Nathiagali Summer College on Physics|Annual international Nathiagali Summer College on Theoretical Physics and Contemporary Needs in Pakistan]] where the first conference was held on Theoretical physics and [[Quantum Mechanics]] in 1976. Munir Khan took special interest in holding the first INSC in 1976 and since then it has evolved into an annual event and an institution for interaction between Nobel Laureates and scientists from the developing world. He invited hundreds of scientists from all over the world to come to Pakistan and interact with Pakistani scientists.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thenucleuspak.org.pk/nucleus/pdf%20Special%20Issue%20Nucleus%2042(1-4)/International%20Nathiagali%20Summer%20College%20(ms616).pdf./&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1972, Abdus Salam directed two Pakistani [[theoretical physicists]], [[Riazuddin (physicist)|Riazuddin]] and [[Masud Ahmad]], who were working under him at the ICTP, to report to Munir Khan on their return to Pakistan where they formed the "Theoretical Physics Group" (TPG) in PAEC. This group would go on to develop the theoretical design of Pakistan's nuclear weapons.&lt;ref&gt;Shahid-ur-Rahman Khan, ''Long Road to Chaghi'' (Islamabad: Print Wise Publications, 1999), pp. 38–39.&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 1996, Khan met Abdus Salam in [[Oxford]]. Khan wrote:

{{quote|text=My last meeting with Abdus Salam was only three months ago. His disease had taken its toll and he was unable to talk. Yet he understood what was said. I told him about the celebration held in Pakistan on his seventieth birthday. He kept staring at me. He had risen above praise. As I rose to leave he pressed my hand to express his feelings as if he wanted to thank everyone who had said kind words about him. Now he has returned home finally, to rest in peace for ever in the soil that he loved so much. May be in the years to come we will rise above our prejudice and own him and give him, after his death, what we could not when he was alive... |sign=Munir Ahmad Khan paying tribute to Abdus Salam|source=&lt;ref name="users.ictp.it"/&gt;}}

Munir Khan's efforts at lobbying for the up-gradation and strengthening of the [[Pakistan Institute of Engineering and Applied Sciences]] (PIEAS), which he had established in 1976 as Pakistan's premier institute for physics and engineering, resulted in PIEAS being awarded university status in 1997 as a full-fledged science research institute status by the government in 2000, culminating as the Pakistan Institute of Engineering and Applied Sciences (PIEAS).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pieas.edu.pk/about/genesis.php&lt;/ref&gt;

Munir Khan remained associated with the [[Pakistan Institute of Engineering and Applied Sciences|PIEAS]] as the [[associate professor]] of [[physics]], a passion that remained entire his life, and was instrumental in scientific competition in the PIEAS between students and professors.&lt;ref name="Salim Mehmud on Munir Khan's work" /&gt;

==Zulifikar Ali Bhutto's trusted aide==
{{Main|Zulfikar Ali Bhutto#Father of the Nuclear weapons program}}

Munir Ahmad Khan became increasingly concerned about politics and international affairs after Pakistan's [[Indo-Pakistani war of 1965|1965 war]] with India.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rahman|1998|pp=95–99}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although, he did not personally know Bhutto at the time though he had seen Bhutto's role in PAEC in 1958 as [[Ministry of Water and Power (Pakistan)|Energy Minister]].&lt;ref name="Pakistan Peoples Party's archives"/&gt;

Khan had his first meeting with Bhutto in October 1965 in [[Vienna]] and asked him to inform the [[Government of Pakistan|Pakistan government]] about the quick advancement and advanced status of the [[Indian nuclear programme]]; many options were drawn out by Munir Khan to Bhutto for Pakistan to acquire its own [[Capability (systems engineering)|nuclear deterrence capability]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Khan|2012|pp=105–108}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Bhutto sensed the importance of the issue, he arranged Munir's private meeting with [[President of Pakistan|President]] [[Ayub Khan (Field Marshal)|Ayub Khan]] on 11 December 1965, at the [[Dorchester Hotel]] in [[London]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Khan|2012|pp=110–111}}&lt;/ref&gt; Without wasting time, Munir Khan asked President Ayub Khan to pursue the [[nuclear deterrent]] against the India's armed [[India and weapons of mass destruction|nuclear threat]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Khan|2012|pp=112–113}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While President Ayub Khan patiently listened to Munir Khan's offer, which according to Munir Khan, was available free of safeguards and at an affordable cost from international supplier states, the President swiftly dismissed the offer since he believed that Pakistan "was too poor to spend" so much money and ended the meeting that if needed, Pakistan would "somehow buy it off the shelf".&lt;ref name="Munir Ahmad Khan’s Speech on Chaghi Medal Award Ceremony" /&gt;

Although the meeting was not successful as expected, Bhutto and Munir Khan vowed to deter the Indian nuclear threat with Bhutto quoting: "''Don't worry. Our turn will come''".&lt;ref name="Pakistan Peoples Party's archives"&gt;{{cite web|last=Baber|first=Farhatullah|title=Bhutto's Footprints on Nuclear Pakistan|url=http://sixhour.com/bhutto_footprints_on%20nuclear_pakistan.htm|publisher=Pakistan Peoples Party's archives|accessdate=13 October 2012|date=4 April 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the beginning of their association, and Munir Khan increasingly became involved with politics and the [[Pakistan Peoples Party]] (PPP).&lt;ref name="Pakistan Peoples Party's archives"/&gt;

Finally, the goal of making Pakistan a [[Nuclear power in Pakistan|nuclear power]] saw its first milestone when country's first commercial [[Karachi Nuclear Power Plant|nuclear power plant]] was inaugurated in [[Karachi]] 28 November 1972.&lt;ref name="Pakistan Peoples Party's archives"/&gt; There, Prime Minister Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto and Munir Khan recalled their past association and similarity of views about developing nuclear capability for Pakistan. While addressing the Munir Ahmad Khan, Bhutto said:

{{cquote|''"Since 1965, I have been in close touch with you (Chairman PAEC) and we have had many occasions to discuss how atomic energy can help in the development of our country. That is why soon after assuming this office, I not only placed the Atomic Energy Commission under my direct control, but asked you to return to the country and serve the nation. I am glad that the Atomic Energy Commission is on the move with a well-defined and broad-based programme for the future. I believe that Pakistan's survival lies in using nuclear research, nuclear technology, and nuclear power for the betterment of its people. The Government will give the fullest support to the Programme of the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission and this country will make the necessary resources available to bring the promise of atomic energy to the people of Pakistan at the earliest possible time".''&lt;ref name="pasha"&gt;S.K. Pasha, "Solar Energy and the Guests at KANUPP Opening", Morning News (Karachi), November 29, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In his inaugural address, the Munir Ahmad Khan addressed the Prime Minister of Pakistan Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto and stated:

{{cquote|''"I remember the day in October, 1965 when I had the opportunity of discussing with you the tremendous potential which atomic energy had and the role it could play in the development of our country. You not only listened but insisted that I present my view to higher-ups. I went. But my pleadings made no impact and I was dubbed as another mad man who thought like Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto. But the times have changed and so has the destiny of our country".''&lt;ref name="pasha" /&gt;}}

Throughout the development of the atomic bomb in the 1970s and 80s, Munir Khan continued his left-wing associations with the Peoples Party even after Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto was [[Operation Fair Play|overthrown]] in a coup led by [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq|Zia-ul-Haq]] who shifted in Bhutto in the [[Adiala Jail]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rehman|1998|pp=55–66}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bhutto continued to send messages to Munir Ahmad Khan inquiring about the progress of various projects of the atomic bomb project when the Chairman of PAEC would  visit the former Prime Minister of Pakistan in jail on the pretext of delivering oranges and vitamins to update him on the status of the nuclear weapons program.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rehman|1998|pp=113–114}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Benazir Bhutto|Benazir]] and [[Murtaza Bhutto]] were instructed by her father to have keep the contacts with Munir Ahmad Khan.&lt;ref group=nb&gt;In 1977, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto instructed his children, Benazir and Murtaza, to keep in touch with the Chairman of PAEC. In 1978, Munir Khan told Benazir and Murtaza that the designing process of the bomb was completed and, Zulfikar Bhutto expected the nuclear test in August 1978. Munir Khan then told Murtaza and Benazir that the tests are moved to December 1978, but delayed indefinitely due to political and diplomatic considerations of the country. Benazir Bhutto, however, continued her ties with Munir Khan and awarded him the Hilal-i-Imtiaz in 1989 for his services to Pakistan's nuclear program in developing nuclear fuel cycle technology for the country.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nti.org/media/pdfs/pakistan_nuclear.pdf?_=1316466791&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 December 1971, Pakistan ultimately called out for a [[ceasefire]] to end the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971|war]] with [[India]] and unconditionally [[Instrument of Surrender (1971)|surrendered]] to India, which culminated with the [[East Pakistan|East-Pakistan]] becoming the independent [[Bangladesh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rahman|1998|pp=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 20 January 1972, [[President of Pakistan|President]] [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]] chaired a winter session at [[Multan]] which was arranged and held by [[Abdus Salam]] and authorized the [[Pakistan and weapons of mass destruction|crash program]] to develop an [[atomic bomb]] for sake of a "national survival".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rahman|1998|pp=39–40}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[President of Pakistan|President]] [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]] invited Khan to take over the work on the [[Pakistan and weapons of mass destruction|crash program]], a task that Khan threw himself into with full vigor.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rahman|1998|pp=40–41}}&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of having been unknown to many senior scientists, Khan busied himself on development of the [[Pakistan and weapons of mass destruction|crash program]], assisting in [[fast neutron calculations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rahman|1998|pp=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that Khan was not a [[Doctoral studies|doctorate holder]],&lt;ref name="Salim Mehmud on Munir Khan's work"/&gt; his extensive experience as [[nuclear engineer]] and then director of [[Nuclear reactor physics|reactor physics]] division at [[IAEA]], enabled him to direct senior scientists to work under him on nuclear projects.&lt;ref name="Salim Mehmud on Munir Khan's work"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mehmud|first1=Salim|title=Memoirs of Salim Mehmud|url=http://pakdef.org/munir-ahmad-khan-memorial-reference/|website=http://pakdef.org/|publisher=Salim Mehmud on Munir Khan's work|accessdate=21 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a short time, he impressed the conservatively-aligned [[Pakistan Military|military]] by the breadth of his knowledge and his unparallel singular grasp in [[engineering]], [[Military logistics|ordnance]], [[metallurgy]], [[chemistry]] and interdisciplinary projects that would differs the [[physics]].&lt;ref name="Salim Mehmud on Munir Khan's work"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rahman|1998|pp=42–43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A detailed framework was established and submitted to [[Prime Minister's Secretariat (Pakistan)|Prime Minister's Secretariat]] which envisioned the infrastructure establishment of numerous manufacturing plants and facilities needed to master the complete [[nuclear fuel cycle]].&lt;ref name=nuclearfiles.org /&gt; On November 1972, he and [[Abdus Salam|Salam]] assisted [[President of Pakistan|President]] [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto|Bhutto]] in inaugurating country's first 137[[Megawatt|MWe]] commercial [[nuclear power plant]], [[KANUPP|KANUPP-I]].&lt;ref name="Shahid-ur-Rehman, 1999; Printwise Publications"/&gt; On December 1972, Khan joined [[Abdus Salam|Salam]] to initiate the work on [[fast neutron calculations]] necessary for the physics mechanism for the [[atomic bomb]]s.&lt;ref name="Shahid-ur-Rehman, 1999; Printwise Publications"&gt;{{cite book|last=Rehman|first=Shahidur|title=Long Road to Chagai:§ The Theoretical Physics Group: a cue to Manhattan Project?|year=1999|publisher=Shahid-ur-Rehman, 1999; Printwise Publications|location=Islamabad, Oxford|isbn=978-969-8500-00-9|page=157|url=https://books.google.com/?id=sNMgAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=Munir+Ahmad+Khan&amp;dq=long+road+to+chagai}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 20 December, Abdus Salam established the [[Pakistan Institute of Nuclear Science and Technology#Research divisions|Theoretical Physics Group]] (TPG) in [[Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission|PAEC]] after calling two [[theoretical physicists]] working at the [[International Center for Theoretical Physics|ICTP]] to meet with Khan at the [[Quaid-e-Azam University]].&lt;ref name="Shahid-ur-Rehman, 1999; Printwise Publications"/&gt;

The TPG under [[Abdus Salam|Salam]] began calculating hidden physics and mathematics problems and seeking [[Method of fundamental solutions|solutions]] for [[fast neutron calculations]] as well as theoretically developing appropriate designs for the [[atomic bomb]]s.&lt;ref name="Shahid-ur-Rehman, 1999; Printwise Publications"/&gt; In 1973, [[Abdus Salam|Salam]] took over the additional work on [[fast neutron calculations]] working  directly under the [[Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission|PAEC]].&lt;ref name="Shahid-ur-Rehman, 1999; Printwise Publications"/&gt;

One of the important acts was to call for a meeting for physical development of a bomb at his [[PINSTECH|Pinstech building]], inviting [[Mechanical engineering|mechanical engineer]] [[Muhammad Hafeez Qureshi|Hafeez Qureshi]] and [[Chemical engineering|chemical engineer]] dr.

During the meeting the word "[[Atom bomb|''bomb'']]" was never used, but the participants fully understood what was being discussed.&lt;ref name="Pakistan Defence Journal, Rai"/&gt;

The next day, Salam, Riazuddin and Khan chaired a last meeting with [[Lieutenant-General]] Qamar Ali Mirza and the [[Engineer-in-Chief (Pakistan Army)|Engineer-in-Chief]] of the [[Corps of Engineers, Pakistan Army|Corps of Engineers]] to handle its part in atomic bomb project, with first starting the construction of the [[Metallurgical Laboratory (Wah)|Metallurgical Laboratory]] (Met Lab).&lt;ref name="Salim Mehmud on Munir Khan's work"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rahman|1998|pp=41–43}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, the DTD busied itself to developed the chemical [[explosive lens]]es, [[Tamper (nuclear weapon)|tampers]], a sub-critical sphere of fissile material could be squeezed into a smaller and denser form.&lt;ref name="§ Munir Ahmad Khan, an interview with authorShahid-ur-Rehman, 1999; Printwise Publications of Islamabad (§ Munir Ahmad Khan, an interview with author)"/&gt;

The TPG worked under [[Abdus Salam|Salam]] until 1974; after Salam's departure, the TPG was instituted under [[Riazuddin (physicist)|Riazuddin]] directly reporting to Khan, and continued to develop new indigenous nuclear weapons designs which were tested in various cold tests by PAEC.&lt;ref name="Shahid-ur-Rehman, 1999; Printwise Publications"/&gt; 
In the months and initial years following Khan's taking over the atomic bomb project, the PAEC's corporate management entered into agreements with [[France]], [[Belgium]], [[Canada]], and [[West-Germany|Germany]] for the supply of a nuclear fuel reprocessing plant, a [[heavy water]] plant and a nuclear fuel fabrication plant, which were to be under IAEA safeguards.&lt;ref name="Maulana Kausar Niazi and Sani Panwjap "&gt;{{Citation

The 1974 was a difficult year for Pakistan and it was anticipated that Pakistan would now have to face international embargoes and sanctions on acquisition of nuclear technology and equipment from supplier states.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rahman|1998|pp=52–59}}&lt;/ref&gt; So a long-term effort was launched for the indigenous production of spare parts, equipment and components for the atom bomb and the energy project.&lt;ref name="thenucleuspak.org.pk" &gt;{{Cite journal

===Plutonium test: Chagai-II===
{{Main|Kirana-I|Chagai-II}}

From the outset, Khan focused on the indigenous development of a plutonium program as part of the fuel cycle.&lt;ref name="Munir Ahmad Khan's interview with Shahidur Rahman"/&gt; Despite many difficulties, Khan and PAEC successfully developed and managed the plutonium infrastructure.&lt;ref name="Munir Ahmad Khan's interview with Shahidur Rahman"/&gt; Khan lobbied and enlightened the importance of plutonium-tritium device and countered the scientific opposition that was led by fellow scientist [[Abdul Qadeer Khan]], who opposed the plutonium route and favoured the uranium atomic bomb.&lt;ref name="Munir Ahmad Khan's interview with Shahidur Rahman"/&gt; Khan concentrated the development efforts on [[plutonium]] [[Implosion-type nuclear weapon|implosion-type fission]] device, in a single group of TPG, which became to known as ''Chagai-II''.&lt;ref name="Munir Ahmad Khan's interview with Shahidur Rahman"/&gt; Khan countered and later abandoned the developmental efforts on [[uranium]] [[gun-type fission weapon]], when on developing the theoretical design, a problem was discovered by ''TPG'' who put efforts to work with Qadeer Khan on gun-type in 1976.&lt;ref name="Munir Ahmad Khan's interview with Shahidur Rahman"/&gt;

The gun-type fission weapon is a simpler design that only had to work with uranium-235 but a possibility of weapon's chain reaction to reach the limit of fizzle level was identified; therefore, the ''TPG'' and Khan abandoned the gun design in favour of an implosion-type weapon.&lt;ref name="Munir Ahmad Khan's interview with Shahidur Rahman"/&gt; In 1983, a milestone was done when a joint work of scientists produced the artificial non-nuclear fission reaction at Kirana Atomic Tests Site (KATS) where the reactor-grade plutonium was used to defer the weapon to go fission.&lt;ref name="Munir Ahmad Khan's interview with Shahidur Rahman"/&gt; In May 1998, the success of plutonium bomb was proved when it was reported that PAEC conducted a test of a powerful plutonium device, ''[[Chagai-II]]'', to artificially produced the nuclear fission, and this plutonium device had the largest yield of all the uranium bombs.&lt;ref name="Munir Ahmad Khan's interview with Shahidur Rahman"/&gt;

In 1999, Khan described the large scientific efforts and PAEC's contribution in heading up and building Pakistan's atomic bomb project, as he stated:

{{quote|text=In 1979–80, the PAEC completed the iron-steel tunnels in Chagai region. On March 11, 1983, we successfully conducted [our] (cold) [[Atomic test|test]] of a working [[atomic bomb]].

We were ahead of others.....|sign=Munir Ahmad Khan, &lt;sub&gt;Statement giving to news media in 1999&lt;/sub&gt;|source=source.&lt;ref name="Transaction Pub"/&gt;}}

By 1979, the [[Pakistan and its Nuclear Deterrent Program|atomic bomb program]] was no longer a secret to the world, especially India who was alarmed by the success of this crash program.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rahman|1998|pp=77–80}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aggressive measures were taken towards modernizing the [[Indian nuclear programme]] in parallel to advancing the [[Indian Space Research Organisation|Indian space programme]].&lt;ref name="Salim Mehmud on Munir Khan's work"/&gt; As a military policy maker, Khan initiated clandestine defence projects in the [[Pakistani military|military]], including lobbying for [[Integrated Missile Research and Development Programme|missile program]] and other strategic projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Khan|2012|pp=231–235}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Witnessing successful launch of the Indian [[Indian Space Research Organisation|ISRO]]'s [[Rohini (satellite)#RS-D1|''Rohini'']] in 1980 through its own [[Satellite Launch Vehicle|SLV]], Khan lobbied for elevation of the [[Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission|Space Research Commission]], securing funds for the space projects.&lt;ref name="Salim Mehmud on Munir Khan's work"/&gt; Helping to appoint [[Salim Mehmud]] as chairman of [[Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission|Space Research Commission]], Khan secured fundings for the development of country's first, the [[Badr-1|Moon-I]], which was eventually launched in 1990.&lt;ref name="Salim Mehmud on Munir Khan's work"/&gt; Development on [[Unguided bomb|unguided]]-[[gravity bomb]]s, [[Tactical nuclear weapon|tactical weapons]] for [[Pakistan Air Force|PAF]]'s [[Air Force Strategic Command (Pakistan)|Air Force Strategic Command]] were watchfully completed under Khan's guidance.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Khan|2012|pp=207–252}}&lt;/ref&gt; The air force engineers successfully installed the system in PAF's [[Mirage 5|Mirage-5]], [[Q-5 Fantan|A-5]], and the [[F-16 Fighting Falcon|F-16s]] as the [[F-16 Fighting Falcon|F-16s]] successfully performed and mastered the low-level laydown aerial techniques, [[Free-fall bomb|conventional free-fall drop]]—a method to drop gravitated nuclear bomb through fighter jets.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Khan|2012|pp=232–240}}&lt;/ref&gt; At international conferences, Khan criticised India for its nuclear programme, and in 1999, Khan defended Pakistan's non-nuclear weapon policy as well as the nuclear tests when he summed up his thoughts:

{{quote|text=In 1972, we (Pakistan) made a [nuclear policy] statement... that [Pakistan] wanted a [[nuclear-free zone]] in [[South Asia]] (so) that the [[Natural resource|resources]] in the [[Indian subcontinent|sub-continent]] could be focused on solving problems of poverty and deprivation of [one] billion people in this region of the world.

In 1981, Israel's [[Operation Opera]] attacked [[Iraq]]'s [[Osirak Nuclear Reactor]].&lt;ref name="Salim Mehmud on Munir Khan's work" /&gt; Great panic was caused in Pakistan and hectic discussions now began to take place between ministries of [[Ministry of Science and Technology (Pakistan)|Science]], [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Pakistan)|Foreign Affairs]], and [[Ministry of Defence (Pakistan)|Defence]] over this issue each day.&lt;ref name="Salim Mehmud on Munir Khan's work" /&gt; In 1983, the  [[Inter-Services Intelligence|ISI]] gained advance knowledge on similar plans on attacking Pakistan's facilities, namely [[Kahuta Research Laboratories|KRL]] and [[PINSTECH|Pinstech]].&lt;ref name="Salim Mehmud on Munir Khan's work" /&gt; Although the [[Pakistan Air Force]] was high alert, the [[Pakistan Government|Pakistan government]] leaked prior information to Khan who was at the [[IAEA]] to mediate the tensions in the region.&lt;ref name="Salim Mehmud on Munir Khan's work" /&gt; At that time, Khan was attending the [[IAEA]]'s [[General Conference (United Nations)|General Conference]] on [[nuclear safety]] issues and received a secret-coded message, through [[:Category:Ambassadors of Pakistan to Austria|Ambassador of Pakistan to Austria]] [[Abdul Sattar (diplomat)|Abdul Sattar]], from the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Pakistan)|Foreign ministry]].&lt;ref name="Salim Mehmud on Munir Khan's work" /&gt; Khan invited dr. [[Raja Ramana]] of [[Atomic Energy Commission of India|Indian Atomic Energy Commission]] to the dinner at the [[Hotel Imperial (Vienna, Austria)|Imperial Hotel]] at [[Vienna]] to confirm the veracity of the knowledge.&lt;ref name="Salim Mehmud on Munir Khan's work" /&gt; Reportedly, Khan told [[Raja Ramana]] that "any attack on Pakistan's [nuclear] facilities would trigger a possible Pakistan [[Second strike|retaliatory strike]] on Indian nuclear facilities at Trombay, which will result in the release of radioactivity causing a major disaster.&lt;ref name="Salim Mehmud on Munir Khan's work" /&gt; Upon returning, [[Raja Ramana]] held leaks information to [[Indian government]] and convened Khan's message to [[Prime Minister of India|Prime Minister]] [[Indira Gandhi]] about Pakistan's [[Second strike|retaliatory strikes]].&lt;ref name="Salim Mehmud on Munir Khan's work" /&gt; Plans were postponed and the matter subsequently shelved.&lt;ref name="Salim Mehmud on Munir Khan's work" /&gt;

In 1988, the governments of [[Government of India|India]] and [[Government of Pakistan|Pakistan]] reached to the [[Agreement Between India and Pakistan on the Prohibition of Attack against Nuclear Installations and Facilities|concessions for agreeing]] that both countries would not attack each other's nuclear facilities.&lt;ref&gt;"George Perkovich,''India's Nuclear Bomb: The Impact on Global Proliferation'' (Berkeley, Los Angeles, and London: University of California Press, 1999), p. 241.http://www.nti.org/e_research/profiles/India/Nuclear/chronology_1983.html."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Government work and advocacy===
{{Main|Nuclear energy in Pakistan}}

Since 1975, Khan had been lobbying for resolving [[energy crises]] by depending on [[Nuclear power in Pakistan|nuclear power]] sources, and had been in direct negotiation with [[United Kingdom|British]] [[British Nuclear Fuels plc|BNFL]] and [[France|French]] [[Commissariat à l'énergie atomique|CEA]] for a [[Nuclear reprocessing|reprocessing plant]] at [[Chashma, Pakistan|Chashma]].&lt;ref name="Salim Mehmud on Munir Khan's work" /&gt; Despite each facilities were put under the [[IAEA safeguards|IAEA inspections]], none of the plans were feasible due to [[United States|U.S.]] objections.&lt;ref name="Maulana Kausar Niazi and Sani Panwjap" /&gt; By the time, the [[Commissariat à l'énergie atomique|CEA]] cancelled the project, the [[Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission|PAEC]] had acquired 95% of detailed plans [[Nuclear reprocessing|reprocessing plant]] which resulted in local constructions of the [[Pakistan Atomic Research Reactor#PARR-III Reactor (New-Labs)|New Labs]].&lt;ref name="Salim Mehmud on Munir Khan's work" /&gt; By the 1980s, Khan had been serving as the [[Ministry of Science and Technology (Pakistan)#Science Advisors|Science Advisor]] playing integral role in implementing policies on science.&lt;ref name="Salim Mehmud on Munir Khan's work" /&gt;

In 1985, Khan lobbied for another plutonium production plant at Khushab, which is known as [[Khushab Nuclear Complex|Khushab Complex]]; and gained the approval of [[Khushab Nuclear Complex|Khushab I]]— a multipurpose heavy water plant, and a tritium production complex.&lt;ref name="Salim Mehmud on Munir Khan's work" /&gt; In 1987, Khan had been lobbying for acquiring [[Nuclear power plant|nuclear plants]] from [[People's Republic of China|China]] which resulted in constructing the [[Chashma Nuclear Power Plant|commercial nuclear power plant]] in [[Chashma, Pakistan|Chashma]].&lt;ref name="Salim Mehmud on Munir Khan's work" /&gt; Acting as [[Minister of State]], he assisted [[Foreign minister of pakistan|Foreign minister]] [[Sahabzada Yaqub Khan|Yaqub Khan]] in [[Beijing]] where he signed the agreement on behalf of Pakistan with [[Premier of the People's Republic of China|Chinese Premier]] [[Li Peng]].&lt;ref name="Salim Mehmud on Munir Khan's work" /&gt;

This accord opened the way for Pakistan to receive Chinese assistance in setting up four 300[[Megawatt|MWe]] commercial nuclear power plants under [[IAEA]] safeguards at Chashma. Therefore, PAEC reached an agreement with China in November 1989 for the supply of 300[[Megawatt|MWe]] [[Chashma Nuclear Power Plant#Unit 1|CHASHNUPP-I]] commercial nuclear power plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news  | last =  | first =  | title =Nuclear Developments: Pakistani Official On Reactor  | newspaper =[[Xinhua News Agency]]  | location =Beijin, People's Republic of China  | page =1  | publisher =[[Xinhua News Agency]]  | date = 20 November 1989  | url =  | accessdate =}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1990, [[President of France|French President]] [[François Mitterrand|Mitterrand]] visited Pakistan and announced that France had agreed to supply 900[[Megawatt|MWe]] commercial nuclear power reactor to Pakistan which was to be under [[IAEA]] safeguards.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news  | last =  | first =  | title =Pakistan: Details On Bhutto-Mitterrand News Conference  | newspaper =Islamabad Domestic Service  | location =Islamabad, Islamabad Capital Territory  | page =1  | publisher =[[Xinhua News Agency]]  | date =21 February 1990  | url =  | accessdate =}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly afterward, Khan stated that the signing of civil nuclear cooperation agreements with China and France had broken a fifteen-year virtual embargo by western states on the supply of nuclear power plants to Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news  | last =  | first =  | title =Nuclear developments: Munir Assures Safety In Nuclear Radiation Utilization  | newspaper =[[Dawn (newspaper)|Dawn Newspaper]]  | location =Karachi, Sindh Province of Pakistan  | page =12  | publisher =[[Dawn Group of Newspapers]]  | date = 15 May 1990  | url =  | accessdate =}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990, Khan entered in negotiations with [[France]] but remained unsuccessful to acquire commercial nuclear plant from [[France]] when [[Prime Minister of Pakistan|Prime Minister]] [[Benazir Bhutto]] was dismissed from the government.&lt;ref name="Salim Mehmud on Munir Khan's work" /&gt;

==Death==
On 22 April 1999, Khan died following complications from heart surgery at the age of 72 in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]]. He is survived by his wife, Thera, three children and four grandchildren.&lt;ref name=death&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/04/24/world/munir-a-khan-72-managed-nuclear-program-in-pakistan.html|title=Munir A.

When Abdus Salam was ejected from his position in 1974, Khan symbolised of many scientists thinking they could control how other peers would use their research.&lt;ref name="Munir Khan Passes Away 1999" /&gt; During the timeline of atomic bomb project, Khan was seen as a symbol of both moral responsibility of scientists, and to the contribution to the rise of Pakistan's science while preventing the politicisation of the project.&lt;ref name="Transaction Pub"/&gt; Popular depiction of Khan's views on nuclear proliferation as a confrontation between right-wing militarists (symbolised by Abdul Qadeer Khan) and left-wing intellectuals (symbolised by Munir Khan) over the moral question of weapons of mass destruction.&lt;ref name="Transaction Pub"&gt;{{cite book|title=Organizational Cultures and the Management of Nuclear Technology Political and Military Sociology|date=2012|publisher=Transaction Pub|isbn=978-1-4128-4945-6|pages=50–150|editor=Karthika Susikumar|format=google books|chapter=Odyssey of Pakistan's largest scientific endeavors towards the building of atomic bombs|url=https://books.google.com/?id=n8SZlczNkUkC&amp;pg=PA71&amp;dq=GD+Alam#v=onepage&amp;q=GD%20Alam&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Babar portrayed Khan as "tragic fate but consciously genius", and also dubbed him as "Nuclear Sage" of Pakistan. In 1999, Khan staunchly backed his country's nuclear technology project, as he puts it:

{{quote|text=The genius of Pakistan (since its establishment in 1947) is her science and her scientists and engineers. [[Politicization of science|Mixing]] [[science]] with [[politics]] is very, very dangerous. This will contaminate the politics which is never clean, with radioactivity, and it will [[Deutsche Physik|destroy]] the science as we witnessed in [[Nazi Germany|[Nazi] Germany]] in 1940s when their [[German nuclear energy project|atomic bomb project]] was politicised for [absolute] political gain. Without a comprehensive [nuclear and political] policy, things do not work, and no country can go developed its nuclear project without having some kind of framework in which to operate. We had to develop a political strategy to launch our project without arousing great deal of suspicion and opposition at the international level, because no body in the world wanted to see Pakistan to become nuclear power. But we had no choice [as mentioned by Bhutto in 1965]. I can tell you...... that it is not only the Western countries; we were wronged by some of the countries who we regard as our friends. It is not because the people in those countries oppose this project, but the governments felt, the rulers felt that Pakistan would become too strong. |sign=Munir Ahmad Khan, &lt;small&gt;statement on May 1999&lt;/small&gt;|source=source&lt;ref name="Munir Ahmad Khan’s Speech on Chaghi Medal Award Ceremony" /&gt;{{failed verification|date=July 2015}} }}

As a scientist, Khan is remembered by his peers as brilliant researcher and engaging teacher, the founder of nuclear engineering in Pakistan.&lt;ref name="Salim Mehmud on Munir Khan's work" /&gt; In spite of his academic discipline, Khan had diverse interests in nuclear physics and theoretical physics where he researched and worked under his mentor Abdus Salam on many problems arising theoretical physics and the nuclear engineering.&lt;ref name="Transaction Pub"/&gt; An award, Munir Ahmad Khan Gold Medal, is named after him at [[Pakistan Institute of Engineering and Applied Sciences|Institute of Engineering and Applied Sciences]]. After years of urging of many of Khan's colleagues in PAEC and his powerful [[Pakistan Peoples Party|political friends]] who had ascended to power in the government,&lt;ref name="The Tribune Express"/&gt; President [[Asif Ali Zardari]] bestowed and honored Khan with the prestigious and highest civilian state award, [[Nishan-e-Imtiaz]] in 2012 as a gesture of political rehabilitation.&lt;ref name="The Tribune Express"&gt;{{cite news|title=Civilian awards: Presidency issues list of 192 recipients|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/421617/civilian-awards-presidency-issues-list-of-192-recipients/|accessdate=29 Dec 2016|newspaper=The Tribune Express newspaper|date=13 August 2012|author=Staff Report|agency=The Tribune Express|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As military and public policy maker, Khan was a [[Technocracy (bureaucratic)|technocrat]] leader in a shift between [[Military funding of science|science and military]], and the emergence of the concept of the big science in Pakistan.&lt;ref name="Salim Mehmud on Munir Khan's work" /&gt; During the Cold war, scientists became involved in military research on unprecedented degree, because of the threat [[communism]] and Indian integration posed to Pakistan, scientists volunteered in great numbers both for technological and organizational assistance to Pakistan's efforts that resulted in powerful tools such as [[laser rangefinder]], the proximity fuse and operations research.&lt;ref name="Shahid-ur-Rehman, 1999; Printwise Publications" /&gt; As a cultured, intellectual, nuclear engineer who became a disciplined military organiser, Khan represented the shift away from the idea that scientists had their "head in the clouds" and that knowledge on such previously esoteric subjects as the composition of the atomic nucleus had no "real-world" applications .&lt;ref name="nuclearfiles.org"&gt;http://www.nuclearfiles.org/menu/key-issues/nuclear-weapons/issues/policy/pakistani-nuclear-policy/munir%20ahmad%20khan's%20speech.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Quotes by Khan==
* ''"We have to understand that nuclear weapons are not a play thing to be bandied publicly. They have to be treated with respect and responsibility. While they can destroy the enemy, they can also invite self destruction."''
* ''"While we were building capabilities in the nuclear fuel cycle, we started in parallel the design of a nuclear device, with its trigger mechanism, physics calculations, production of metal, making precision mechanical components, high-speed electronics, diagnostics, and testing facilities. For each one of them, we established different laboratories".''&lt;ref name="Nuclear files"/&gt;
* ''"Many sources were tapped after the decision to go nuclear. We were simultaneously working on 20 labs and projects under the administrative control of PAEC, every one the size of Khan Research Laboratories."''
* ''"On 11 March 1983, we successfully conducted the first cold test of a working nuclear device. That evening, I went to General Zia with the news that Pakistan was now ready to make a nuclear device."''&lt;ref name="Nuclear files"/&gt;

'''New racism''' is a term coined in 1981 by [[Marxism|Marxist]] professor of film [[Martin Barker]], in the context of the ideologies supporting [[Margaret Thatcher]]'s rise in the [[United Kingdom|UK]], to refer to what he believed was [[racist]] [[public discourse]] depicting [[immigrants]] as a threat.&lt;ref name="Chin09"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cole97p12"/&gt; New racism can be described as "more indirect, more subtle, more procedural, more ostensibly nonracial".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|jstor = 2111369|title = The New Racism|last = Pettigrew|first = |date = 1991|journal = American Journal of Political Science|doi = 10.2307/2111369|pmid = |volume=35|pages=423}}&lt;/ref&gt; New racism suggests to have some sort of new strength because it does not appear to be [[racism]]. New racism relies more heavily on manipulation of ideas within [[mass media]] and to reproduce and disseminate the ideologies needed to justify racism. These new techniques present [[Hegemony|hegemonic ideologies]] that claim that racism is over.&lt;ref name="Collins 2004 1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Black Sexual Politics|last = Collins|first = Patricia Hill|publisher = Routledge New York|year = 2004|isbn = |location = New York|pages = 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also transnational; one can now have racial inequality that does not appear to be regulated by the state to the same degree. Globalization, [[Transnationalism|trans-nationalism]], and the growth of hegemonic ideologies within mass media provide the context for a new racism that has catalyzed changes within African, Black American and African-Diasporic societies.&lt;ref name="Collins 2004 1"/&gt;

==1980s wave of anti-immigrant sentiment==
From the 1980s, the increase in [[globalization|global inequalities]] between poor and rich countries led to significant immigration flows to Europe, even in those less developed European countries that until the 1970s were more a source of emigration.

A new wave of [[Opposition to immigration|anti-immigrant]] sentiment had started to emerge in the 1970s, most significantly with UK's [[National Front (United Kingdom)|National Front]]; in the early such sentiments gained significant support, most prominently with the electoral success of [[Jean-Marie Le Pen]]'s [[Front National (France)|Front National]] French party, which gained 10% of the vote in the [[1984 European elections]].&lt;ref name="Cole97p12"/&gt; Le Pen's success will serve as a model for many parties and movements that will emulate him all over Europe.&lt;ref name="Cole97p12"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dancygier, Rafaela M. (2010) [https://books.google.com/books?id=vTRzzVMzhScC ''Immigration and Conflict in Europe''], p.5 quote: "The far-right ''Front National'' has served as a model to many anti-immigrant movements in Europe."&lt;/ref&gt;

Many scholars have called this new anti-immigrant sentiments, and the ideologies alimenting it, a new form of racism,&lt;ref name="Cole97p12"/&gt; and the label "new racism" has been particularly influential.&lt;ref name="Chin09"&gt;Chin (2009) pp.13, 92, 178-9, 241&lt;/ref&gt; These scholars argued that the new racism had to cope with the mainstream official repudiation of racism, [[Fascism]] and [[Nazism]], and as a consequence substituted the rhetoric of race and biology with that of [[cultural identity]].&lt;ref name="Cole97p12"/&gt;

These sentiments were first expressed by marginal parties, but as they increased their support by attracting votes from mainstream parties, the leaders of such parties, Margaret Thatcher&lt;ref name="Chin09"/&gt; and [[Bettino Craxi]]&lt;ref&gt;Ginsborg (2003) pp.62, 176&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Guild and Minderhoud (2006) p.173&lt;/ref&gt; started to embrace some of the same anti-immigrant ideologies.&lt;ref name="Cole97p12"&gt;Cole, Jeffrey (1997) [https://books.google.com/books?id=kB3Nqg0ZL8oC ''The new racism in Europe: a Sicilian ethnography''], p.11-2&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Niklas Luhmann''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|l|uː|m|ən}}; {{IPA-de|ˈluːman|lang}}; December 8, 1927 – November 6, 1998) was a [[Germany|German]] [[sociologist]], philosopher of social science, and a prominent thinker in [[systems theory]], who is considered one of the most important social theorists of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Bechmann and Stehr, 'The Legacy of Niklas Luhmann' Society (2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Luhmann was born in [[Lüneburg]], [[Prussia]], where his father's family had been running a [[brewery]] for several generations. After graduating from the Johanneum school in 1943, he was conscripted as a [[Luftwaffenhelfer]] in [[World War II]] and served for two years until, at the age of 17, he was taken [[prisoner of war]] by American troops in 1945.&lt;ref&gt;In an interview Luhmann once said: ''"... die Behandlung war –&amp;nbsp;gelinde gesagt&amp;nbsp;– nicht nach den Regeln der internationalen Konventionen".'' Source: Detlef Horster (1997), ''Niklas Luhmann'', München, p.28.&lt;/ref&gt; After the war Luhmann studied law at the [[Albert Ludwigs University of Freiburg|University of Freiburg]] from 1946 to 1949, when he obtained a law degree, and then began a career in Lüneburg's public administration. During a sabbatical in 1961, he went to [[Harvard]], where he met and studied under [[Talcott Parsons]], then the world's most influential social systems theorist.

In later years, Luhmann dismissed Parsons' theory, developing a rival approach of his own. Leaving the civil service in 1962, he lectured at the national [[Deutsche Hochschule für Verwaltungswissenschaften]] (University for Administrative Sciences) in [[Speyer]], Germany, until 1965, when he was offered a position at the [[Sozialforschungsstelle]] (Social Research Centre) of the [[University of Münster]], led by [[Helmut Schelsky]].
1965/66 he studied one semester of sociology at the University of Münster.

Two earlier books were retroactively accepted as a PhD thesis and [[habilitation]] at the University of Münster in 1966, qualifying him for a university professorship. In 1968/1969, he briefly served as a lecturer at [[Theodor Adorno]]'s former chair at the [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe University Frankfurt am Main|University of Frankfurt]] and then was appointed full professor of sociology at the newly founded [[University of Bielefeld]], Germany (until 1993). He continued to publish after his retirement, when he finally found the time to complete his magnum opus, ''Die Gesellschaft der Gesellschaft'' (literally, "The Society of Society"), which was published in 1997, and translated subsequently in English, under the title "Theory of Society" (volume I in 2012 and volume II in 2013).

==Works==
Luhmann wrote prolifically, with more than 70 books and nearly 400 scholarly articles published on a variety of subjects, including law, economy, politics, art, religion, ecology, mass media, and love. While his theories have yet to make a major mark in American sociology, his theory is currently well known and popular in German sociology,&lt;ref name="(Roth 2011)"&gt;Roth, S. (2011) Les deux angleterres et le continent. Anglophone sociology as the guardian of Old European semantics, Journal of Sociocybernetics, Vol. 9, No. 1-2, available for [http://ssrn.com/abstract=2265350 download at SSRN]&lt;/ref&gt; and has also been rather intensively received in [[Japan]] and Eastern Europe, including [[Russia]]. His relatively low profile elsewhere is partly due to the fact that translating his work is a difficult task, since his writing presents a challenge even to readers of German, including many sociologists. (p. xxvii Social Systems 1995)

Much of Luhmann's work directly deals with the operations of the legal system and his autopoietic theory of law is regarded as one of the more influential contributions to the [[sociology of law]] and socio-legal studies.&lt;ref&gt;Luhmann, N, ''A Sociological Theory of Law'' (1985) and ''Law As a Social System'', translated by Klaus A. Ziegert (Oxford University Press, 2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

Luhmann is probably best known to North Americans for his debate with the [[critical theory|critical theorist]] [[Jürgen Habermas]] over the potential of [[social system]]s theory. Like his one-time mentor [[Talcott Parsons]], Luhmann is an advocate of "grand theory," although neither in the sense of philosophical foundationalism nor in the sense of "meta-narrative" as often invoked in the critical works of post-modernist writers. Rather, Luhmann's work tracks closer to complexity theory broadly speaking, in that it aims to address any aspect of social life within a universal theoretical framework - of which the diversity of subjects he wrote about is an indication. Luhmann's theory is sometimes dismissed as highly abstract and complex, particularly within the Anglophone world, whereas his work has had a more lasting influence on scholars from German-speaking countries, Scandinavia and Italy.&lt;ref name="(Roth 2011)"/&gt;

Luhmann himself described his theory as "labyrinth-like" or "non-linear" and claimed he was deliberately keeping his prose enigmatic to prevent it from being understood "too quickly", which would only produce simplistic misunderstandings.&lt;ref&gt;"Niklas Luhmann: Unverständliche Wissenschaft: Probleme einer theorieeigenen Sprache, in: Luhmann, ''Soziologische Aufklärung 3: Soziales System, Gesellschaft, Organisation''. Wiesbaden: VS Verlag, 4th. ed. 2005, pp. 193-205, quote on p. 199.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Systems theory===
Luhmann's systems theory focuses on three topics, which are interconnected in his entire work.&lt;ref&gt;Niklas Luhmann (1975), "Systemtheorie, Evolutionstheorie und Kommunikationstheorie", in: ''Soziologische Gids'' 22 3. pp.154–168&lt;/ref&gt;
# Systems theory as societal theory
# Communication theory and
# Evolution theory
The core element of Luhmann's theory, pivots around the problem of the contingency of the meaning and thereby it becomes a theory of [[communication]]. Social systems are systems of communication, and society is the most encompassing social system. Being the social system that comprises all (and only) communication, today's society is a world society.&lt;ref&gt;Niklas Luhmann. (1982). The World Society as a Social System. International Journal of General Systems, 8:3, 131-138.&lt;/ref&gt; A [[system]] is defined by a boundary between itself and its [[social environment|environment]], dividing it from an infinitely complex, or (colloquially) chaotic, exterior. The interior of the system is thus a zone of reduced complexity: Communication within a system operates by selecting only a limited amount of all information available outside. This process is also called "reduction of complexity".
The criterion according to which information is selected and processed is meaning (in German, ''Sinn''). Both social systems and psychic  systems (see below for an explanation of this distinction) operate by processing meaning.

Furthermore, each system has a distinctive identity that is constantly reproduced in its communication and depends on what is considered meaningful and what is not. If a system fails to maintain that identity, it ceases to exist as a system and dissolves back into the environment it emerged from. Luhmann called this process of reproduction from elements previously filtered from an over-complex environment [[autopoiesis]] (pronounced "auto-poy-E-sis"; literally: self-creation), using a term coined in [[cognitive biology]] by Chilean thinkers [[Humberto Maturana]] and [[Francisco Varela]]. Social systems are ''operationally closed'' in that while they use and rely on resources from their environment, those resources do not become part of the systems' operation. Both thought and digestion are important preconditions for communication, but neither appears in communication as such. Note, however, that Maturana argued very vocally that this appropriation of autopoietic theory was conceptually unsound, as it presupposes the autonomy of communications from actual persons. That is, by describing social systems as operationally closed networks of communications, Luhmann (according to Maturana) ignores the fact that communications presuppose human communicators. Autopoiesis only applies to networks of processes that reproduce themselves,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Varela, F., Maturana, H., &amp; Uribe, R.|title=Autopoiesis: The organization of living systems, its characterization and a model|journal=Biosystems|year=1974|volume=5|pages=187–196|doi=10.1016/0303-2647(74)90031-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; but communications are reproduced by humans. For this reason, the analogy from biology to sociology does not, in this case, hold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Maturana, H., &amp; Poerkson, B.|title=From Being to Doing: The Origins of the Biology of Cognition|year=2004|publisher=Carl Auer International|isbn=3896704486|pages=105–108}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, Luhmann explicitly stressed that he does not refer to a "society without humans", but to the fact that communication is autopoietic. Communication is made possible by human bodies and consciousness&lt;ref&gt;Luhmann, N. ''Theory of Society, Vol. 1''. Stanford University Press, 2012, pp.56.&lt;/ref&gt;, but this does not make communication operationally open. To "participate" in communication, one must be able to render one's thoughts and perceptions into elements of communication. This can only ever occur as a communicative operation (thoughts and perceptions cannot be directly transmitted) and must therefore satisfy internal system conditions that are specific to communication: intelligibility, reaching and addressee and gaining acceptance&lt;ref&gt;Luhmann, N. ''Social Systems''. Stanford University Press, 1995, p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt;.

Luhmann likens the operation of autopoiesis (the filtering and processing of information from the environment) to a [[program (management)|program]], making a series of logical distinctions (in German, ''Unterscheidungen''). Here, Luhmann refers to the British mathematician [[G. Spencer-Brown]]'s logic of distinctions that Maturana and Varela had earlier identified as a model for the functioning of any cognitive process. The supreme criterion guiding the "self-creation" of any given system is a defining [[binary code]]. This binary code is not to be confused with the computers operation: Luhmann (following Spencer-Brown and [[Gregory Bateson]]) assumes that auto-referential systems are continuously confronted with the dilemma of disintegration/continuation. This dilemma is framed with an ever-changing set of available choices; every one of those potential choices can be the system's selection or not (a binary state, selected/rejected). The influence of Spencer-Brown's book, ''[[Laws of Form]]'', on Luhmann can hardly be overestimated.

Although Luhmann first developed his understanding of social systems theory under Parsons' influence, he soon moved away from the Parsonian concept. The most important difference is that Parsons framed systems as forms of [[Action theory (sociology)|action]], in accordance with the [[AGIL paradigm]]. Parsons' systems theory treats systems as [[Open system (systems theory)|operationally open]], and interactive through an [[Input/output|input and output schema]]. Influenced by [[second-order cybernetics]], Luhmann instead treats systems as [[autopoietic]] and [[Open_and_closed_systems_in_social_science#Sociology|operationally closed]]&lt;ref&gt;Luhmann, N. ''Social Systems''. Stanford University Press, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Luhmann, N. ''Introduction to Systems Theory''. Polity, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;. Systems must continually construct themselves and their perspective of reality through processing the distinction between system and [[Environment (systems)|environment]], and self-reproduce themselves as the product of their own elements. Social systems are defined by Luhmann not as action but as [[Recursion|recursive]] communication. Modern society is defined as a world system consisting of the sum total of all communication happening at once&lt;ref&gt;Luhmann, N. ''Theory of Society, Vol. 1''. Stanford University Press, 2012, pp. 83-99.&lt;/ref&gt;, and individual function systems (such as the economy, politics, science, love, art, the media, etc.) are described as social subsystems which have "outdifferentiated" from the social system and achieved their own operational closure and autopoiesis&lt;ref&gt;Luhmann, N. ''Theory of Society, Vol. 2''. Stanford University Press, 2013, pp. 65ff.&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Another difference is that Parsons asks how certain subsystems contribute to the functioning of overall society. Luhmann starts with the  [[Differentiation (sociology)|differentiation of the systems]]  themselves out of a nondescript environment. While he does observe how certain systems fulfill functions that contribute to "society" as a whole, he dispenses with the assumption of ''a priori'' [[Collective consciousness|cultural or normative consensus]] or "complimentary purpose" which was common to Durkheim and Parsons' conceptualization of a social function&lt;ref&gt;Luhmann, N. ''Theory of Society, Vol. 1''. Stanford University Press, 2012, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;. For Luhmann, functional differentiation is a consequence of selective pressure under temporalized complexity, and it occurs as function systems independently establish their own ecological niches by performing a function&lt;ref&gt;Luhmann, N. ''Theory of Society, Vol. 1''. Stanford University Press, 2012, esp. pp. 336-343.&lt;/ref&gt;. Functions are therefore not the coordinated components of the organic social whole, but rather contingent and selective responses to reference problems which obey no higher principle of order and could have been responded to in other ways.

Finally, the systems' autopoietic closure is another fundamental difference from Parsons' concept. Each system works strictly according to its very own code and can observe other systems only by applying its code to their operations. For example, the code of the economy involves the application of the distinction between payment and non-payment. Other system operations appear within the economic field of references only insofar as this economic code can be applied to them. Hence, a political decision becomes an economic operation when it is observed as a government spending money or not. Likewise, a legal judgement may also be an economic operation when settlement of a contractual dispute obliges one party to pay for the goods or services they had acquired. The codes of the economy, politics and law operate autonomously, but their "interpenetration"&lt;ref&gt;Luhmann, N. ''Social Systems''. Stanford University Press, 1995, Chapter 6.&lt;/ref&gt; is evident when observing "events"&lt;ref&gt;Luhmann, N. ''Theory of Society, Vol. 2''. Stanford University Press, 2013, p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt; which simultaneously involve the participation of more than one system.

One seemingly peculiar, but within the overall framework strictly logical, axiom of Luhmann's theory is the human being's position outside any social system, initially developed by Parsons. Consisting of "pure communicative actions" (a reference to [[Jürgen Habermas]]) any social system requires human consciousnesses (personal or psychical systems) as an obviously necessary, but nevertheless environmental resource. In Luhmann's terms, human beings are neither part of society nor of any specific systems, just as they are not part of a conversation. Luhmann himself once said concisely that he was "not interested in people". That is not to say that people were not a matter for Luhmann, but rather, the communicative actions of people are constituted (but not defined) by society, and society is constituted (but not defined) by the communicative actions of people: society is people's environment, and people are society's environment. Thus, sociology can explain how persons can change society; the influence of the environment (the people) on the system (the society), the so-called ''"structural coupling"''. In fact Luhmann himself replied to the relevant criticism by stating that "In fact the theory of autopoietic systems could bear the title ''Taking Individuals Seriously'', certainly more seriously than our humanistic tradition" (Niklas Luhmann, ''Operational Closure and Structural Coupling: The Differentiation of the Legal System'', Cardozo Law Review, vol. 13: 1422). This approach has attracted criticism from those who argue that Luhmann has at no point demonstrated the operational closure of social systems, or in fact that autopoietic social systems actually exist. He has instead taken this as a premise or presupposition, resulting in the logical need to exclude humans from social systems, which prevents the social systems view from accounting for the individual behavior, action, motives, or indeed existence of any individual person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Autopoiesis in Organization: Theory and Practice|year=2009|publisher=Emerald|location=Bingley, UK|pages=111–129|author=Fuchs, C., &amp; Hofkirchner, W.|chapter=Autopoiesis and Critical Social Systems Theory. In Magalhães, R., Sanchez, R., (Eds.),}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Luhmann was devoted to the ideal of non-normative science introduced to sociology in the early 20th century by [[Max Weber]] and later re-defined and defended against its critics by [[Karl Popper]]. However, in an academic environment that never strictly separated descriptive and normative theories of society, Luhmann's sociology has widely attracted criticism from various intellectuals, including [[Jürgen Habermas]].{{fact|date=March 2017}}

===Luhmann's reception===
Luhmann's systems theory is not without its critics; his definitions of "autopoietic" and "social system" differ from others.
At the same time his theory is being applied or used worldwide by sociologists and other scholars. It is often used in analyses dealing with [[Corporate Social Responsibility|corporate social responsibility]], organisational [[Legitimacy (family law)|legitimacy]], [[Governance|governance structures]] as well as with [[sociology of law]] and of course general [[sociology]].
===Miscellaneous===
Luhmann also appears as a character in [[Paul Wühr]]'s work of literature ''[[Das falsche Buch]]'', together with - among others - [[Ulrich Sonnemann]], [[Johann Georg Hamann]] and [[Richard Buckminster Fuller]].

Luhmann owned a pub ("Pons") in his parents' house in his native town of [[Lüneburg]]. The house, which also contained his father's brewery, had been in his family's hands since 1857.

His recent work has also focused on [[psychoanalysis]] and [[Jaques Lacan]].

Feltham received his [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] at the [[University of Sydney]]. In 2000, he completed his doctoral thesis at [[Deakin University]] in [[Melbourne, Australia|Melbourne]], writing his dissertation on the [[ontology|ontological]] distinction between [[praxis (process)|praxis]] and work in ancient and modern philosophy (with a focus on Badiou and [[Michel Foucault]]) based on research Feltham conducted in Paris.&lt;ref name="faculty homepage"&gt;[http://www.aup.edu/faculty/dept/clen/feltham.htm Faculty Homepage]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pantheism''' is the belief that [[reality]] is identical with [[divinity]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title = The New Oxford Dictionary Of English | publisher = Clarendon Press|year = 1998 | location = Oxford | pages = 1341|isbn = 978-0-19-861263-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; or that [[Everything|all-things]] compose an all-encompassing, [[immanence|immanent]] god.&lt;ref name="Edwards"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Encyclopedia of Philosophy ed. Paul Edwards |publisher=Macmillan and Free Press |year = 1967 |location = New York|pages=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pantheist [[Belief revision|belief]] does not recognize a distinct [[personal god|personal]] [[anthropomorphic]] god&lt;ref&gt;A Companion to Philosophy of Religion edited by Charles Taliaferro, Paul Draper, Philip L. Quinn, p.340 "They deny that God is "totally other" than the world or ontologically distinct from it."&lt;/ref&gt; and instead characterizes a broad range of doctrines differing in forms of relationships between reality and divinity.&lt;ref name="LevineDetailed"/&gt;

Pantheism was popularized in [[Western culture]] as a [[theology]] and philosophy based on the work of the 17th-century philosophers [[Baruch Spinoza]], particularly his book ''[[Ethics (Spinoza)|Ethics]]'', and [[Giordano Bruno]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.it/books?id=7w4_zYPOVEcC&amp;pg=PA75&amp;dq=Bruno+pantheism&amp;hl=it&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj-tvPHi6beAhUn-YUKHahzA_sQ6AEIUjAI#v=onepage&amp;q=Bruno%20pantheism&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Genevieve Lloyd 1996"&gt;Genevieve Lloyd, Routledge Philosophy GuideBook to Spinoza and The Ethics (Routledge Philosophy Guidebooks), Routledge; 1 edition (2 October 1996), {{ISBN|978-0-415-10782-2}}, Page: 24&lt;/ref&gt; The term "pantheism" was coined by mathematician [[Joseph Raphson]] in 1697&lt;ref name="Taylor"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Thomson/&gt; and has since been used to describe the beliefs of a variety of people and organizations.

Pantheistic concepts date back thousands of years, and pantheistic elements have been identified in various religious traditions.

==Etymology==
''Pantheism'' derives from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] πᾶν ''pan'' (meaning "all, of everything") and θεός ''theos'' (meaning "god, divine"). The first known combination of these roots appears in [[Latin]], in [[Joseph Raphson]]'s 1697 book ''De Spatio Reali seu Ente Infinito'',&lt;ref name=Thomson/&gt; where he refers to the "pantheismus" of Spinoza and others.&lt;ref name="Taylor"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Taylor|first1=Bron|title=Encyclopedia of Religion and Nature|date=2008|publisher=A&amp;C Black|isbn=978-1441122780|pages=1341–1342|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i4mvAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA1342&amp;lpg=PA134|accessdate=27 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It was subsequently translated into English as "pantheism" in 1702.

==Definitions==
There are a variety of definitions of pantheism. Some consider it a theological and philosophical [[Conceptions of God|position concerning God]].&lt;ref name=Picton&gt;{{cite book|last=Picton|first=James Allanson|title=Pantheism: its story and significance|year=1905|publisher=Archibald Constable &amp; CO LTD.|location=Chicago|isbn=978-1419140082|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-_yjarZwEhoC&amp;pg=PP8}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p.8}}

Pantheism is the view that everything is part of an all-encompassing, immanent God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mastin|first1=Luke|title=Pantheism - By Branch / Doctrine - The Basics of Philosophy|url=http://www.philosophybasics.com/branch_pantheism.html|website=www.philosophybasics.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; All forms of reality may then be considered either modes of that Being, or identical with it.&lt;ref name="Deity"&gt;Owen, H. P. ''Concepts of Deity''. London: Macmillan, 1971, p. 65..&lt;/ref&gt; Some hold that pantheism is a non-religious philosophical position. To them, pantheism is the view that the Universe (in the sense of the totality of all existence) and God are identical (implying a denial of the personality and transcendence of God).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title = The New Oxford Dictionary Of English|publisher = Clarendon Press|year = 1998|location = Oxford|pages=1341|isbn=978-0-19-861263-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Pre-modern times===
Pantheistic tendencies existed in a number of early [[Gnosticism|Gnostic]] groups, with pantheistic thought appearing throughout the Middle Ages.&lt;ref name=Worman/&gt; These included a section of [[Johannes Scotus Eriugena]]'s 9th-century work [[De divisione naturae]] and the beliefs of mystics such as [[Amalric of Bena]] (11th{{endash}}12th centuries) and [[Meister Eckhart|Eckhart]] (12th{{endash}}13th).&lt;ref name=Worman/&gt;{{rp|pp. 620–621}}

The [[Roman Catholic Church]] has long regarded pantheistic ideas as heresy.&lt;ref&gt;Collinge, William, ''Historical Dictionary of Catholicism'', Scarecrow Press, 2012, p 188, {{ISBN|9780810879799}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.catholic.com/qa/what-is-pantheism|title=What is pantheism?|work=catholic.com|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170801114835/https://www.catholic.com/qa/what-is-pantheism|archivedate=1 August 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Giordano Bruno]], an Italian monk who evangelized about an immanent and infinite God, was burned at the stake in 1600 by the [[Roman Inquisition]]. He has since become known as a celebrated pantheist and martyr of science,&lt;ref&gt;McIntyre, James Lewis, ''Giordano Bruno'', Macmillan, 1903, p 316.&lt;/ref&gt; and an influence on many later thinkers.

===Baruch Spinoza===

In the West, pantheism was formalized as a separate theology and philosophy based on the work of the 17th-century philosopher Baruch Spinoza.&lt;ref name=Picton/&gt;{{rp|p.7}} Spinoza was a Dutch philosopher of Portuguese descent raised in the [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardi Jewish]] community in [[Amsterdam]].&lt;ref name=tws908&gt;{{cite news | author=Anthony Gottlieb | title = God Exists, Philosophically (review of "Spinoza: A Life" by Steven Nadler) | publisher=The New York Times, Books. 18 July 1999 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/books/99/07/18/reviews/990718.18gottlit.html | accessdate =7 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He developed highly controversial ideas regarding the authenticity of the Hebrew Bible and the nature of the Divine, and was effectively excluded from Jewish society at age 23, when the [[Portuguese Synagogue (Amsterdam)|local synagogue]] issued a ''[[Herem (censure)|herem]]'' against him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.neh.gov/humanities/2013/septemberoctober/feature/why-spinoza-was-excommunicated|title=Why Spinoza Was Excommunicated|date=2015-09-01|website=National Endowment for the Humanities|language=en|access-date=2017-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of his books were published posthumously, and shortly thereafter included in the Catholic Church's ''[[Index Librorum Prohibitorum|Index of Forbidden Books]]''.

===18th century===
The first known use of the term "pantheism" was in Latin ("pantheismus" &lt;ref name="Taylor"/&gt;) by the English mathematician Joseph Raphson in his work ''De Spatio Reali seu Ente Infinito'', published in 1697.&lt;ref name=Thomson&gt;Ann Thomson; Bodies of Thought: Science, Religion, and the Soul in the Early Enlightenment, 2008, page 54.&lt;/ref&gt; Raphson begins with a distinction between atheistic "panhylists" (from the Greek roots ''[[wikt:pan-|pan]]'', "all", and ''[[wikt:hyle|hyle]]'', "matter"), who believe everything is matter, and Spinozan "pantheists" who believe in "a certain universal substance, material as well as intelligence, that fashions all things that exist out of its own essence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Raphson|first=Joseph|title=De spatio reali|year=1697|publisher=Londini|pages=2|language=Latin}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Suttle|first=Gary|title=Joseph Raphson: 1648–1715|url=http://naturepantheist.org/raph-son.html|publisher=Pantheist Association for Nature|accessdate=7 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Raphson thought that the universe was immeasurable in respect to a human's capacity of understanding, and believed that humans would never be able to comprehend it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Koyré|first=Alexander|title=From the Closed World to the Infinite Universe|year=1957|publisher=Johns Hopkins Press|location=Baltimore, Md.|isbn=978-0801803475|pages=190–204|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/astro/cwiu/cwiu11.htm#page_190}}&lt;/ref&gt; He referred to the pantheism of the Ancient Egyptians, Persians, Syrians, Assyrians, Greek, Indians, and Jewish Kabbalists, specifically referring to Spinoza.&lt;ref name="T Bennet"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bennet|first1=T|title=The History of the Works of the Learned|date=1702|publisher=H.Rhodes|pages=498|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zv0vAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=498|accessdate=28 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term was first used in English by a translation of Raphson's work in 1702. It was later used and popularized by [[Irish people|Irish]] writer [[John Toland]] in his work of 1705 ''Socinianism Truly Stated, by a pantheist''.&lt;ref name="Dabundo"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dabundo|first1=Laura|title=Encyclopedia of Romanticism (Routledge Revivals):|date=2009|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1135232351|pages=442–443|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KMeOAgAAQBAJ|accessdate=27 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Worman/&gt;{{rp|pp. 617–618}} Toland was influenced by both Spinoza and Bruno, and had read Joseph Raphson's ''De Spatio Reali'', referring to it as "the ingenious Mr. Ralphson's (sic) Book of Real Space".&lt;ref&gt;Daniel, Stephen H. "Toland's Semantic Pantheism," in John Toland's Christianity not Mysterious, Text, Associated Works and Critical Essays. Edited by Philip McGuinness, Alan Harrison, and Richard Kearney.  Dublin, Ireland: The Lilliput Press, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; Like Raphson, he used the terms "pantheist" and "Spinozist" interchangeably.&lt;ref&gt;R.E. Sullivan, "John Toland and the Deist controversy: A Study in Adaptations", Harvard University Press, 1982, p. 193&lt;/ref&gt; In 1720 he wrote the ''Pantheisticon: or The Form of Celebrating the Socratic-Society'' in Latin, envisioning a pantheist society that believed, "All things in the world are one, and one is all in all things ... what is all in all things is God, eternal and immense, neither born nor ever to perish."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Harrison|first=Paul|title=Toland: The father of modern pantheism|url=http://www.pantheism.net/paul/history/toland.htm|work=Pantheist History|publisher=World Pantheist Movement|accessdate=5 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Toland, John, Pantheisticon, 1720; reprint of the 1751 edition, New York and London: Garland, 1976, p 54&lt;/ref&gt; He clarified his idea of pantheism in a letter to [[Gottfried Leibniz]] in 1710 when he referred to "the pantheistic opinion of those who believe in no other eternal being but the universe".&lt;ref name=Worman/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Paul Harrison, ''Elements of Pantheism'', 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Honderich, Ted, ''The Oxford Companion to Philosophy'', Oxford University Press, 1995, p.641: "First used by John Toland in 1705, the term 'pantheist' designates one who holds both that everything there is constitutes a unity and that this unity is divine."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, Ann, ''Bodies of Thought: Science, Religion, and the Soul in the Early Enlightenment'', Oxford University Press, 2008, p 133, {{ISBN|9780199236190}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-eighteenth century, the English theologian [[Daniel Waterland]] defined pantheism this way: "It supposes God and nature, or God and the whole universe, to be one and the same substance—one universal being; insomuch that men's souls are only modifications of the divine substance."&lt;ref name=Worman&gt;Worman, J. H., "Pantheism", in ''Cyclopædia of Biblical, Theological, and Ecclesiastical Literature, Volume 1'', John McClintock, James Strong (Eds), Harper &amp; Brothers, 1896, pp 616–624.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Worman cites Waterland, Works, viii, p 81.&lt;/ref&gt; In the early nineteenth century, the German theologian [[Julius Wegscheider]] defined pantheism as the belief that God and the world established by God are one and the same.&lt;ref name=Worman/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Worman cites Wegscheider, Inst 57, p 250.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pantheism controversy====
Between 1785–89, a major controversy about Spinoza's philosophy arose between the German philosophers [[Friedrich Heinrich Jacobi]] (a critic) and [[Moses Mendelssohn]] (a defender). Known in German as the ''[[Pantheism controversy|Pantheismusstreit]]'' (pantheism controversy), it helped spread pantheism to many German thinkers.&lt;ref&gt;Friedrich Heinrich Jacobi, in [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/friedrich-jacobi/ ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (plato.stanford.edu)].&lt;/ref&gt;
A 1780 conversation with the German dramatist [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing]] led Jacobi to a protracted study of Spinoza's works. Lessing stated that he knew no other philosophy than Spinozism.
Jacobi's ''Über die Lehre des Spinozas'' (1st ed. 1785, 2nd ed. 1789) expressed his strenuous objection to a dogmatic system in philosophy, and drew upon him the enmity of the Berlin group, led by Mendelssohn. Jacobi claimed that Spinoza's doctrine was pure [[materialism]], because all Nature and God are said to be nothing but extended [[Substance theory|substance]]. This, for Jacobi, was the result of Enlightenment [[rationalism]] and it would finally end in absolute atheism. Mendelssohn disagreed with Jacobi, saying that pantheism shares more characteristics of [[theism]] than of atheism. The entire issue became a major intellectual and religious concern for European civilization at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dahlstrom|title=Moses Mendelssohn|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/mendelssohn/#ConJacOveLesAllPan|website=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=28 July 2017|date=3 Dec 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Willi Goetschel argues that Jacobi's publication significantly shaped Spinoza's wide reception for centuries following its publication, obscuring the nuance of Spinoza's philosophic work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Goetschel|first1=Willi|title=Spinoza's Modernity: Mendelssohn, Lessing, and Heine|date=2004|publisher=University of Wisconsin Press|location=Madison, Wisconsin|isbn=978-0299190804|pages=12–13|ref=Goetschel2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===19th century===

====Growing influence====
During the beginning of the 19th century, pantheism was the viewpoint of many leading writers and philosophers, attracting figures such as [[William Wordsworth]] and [[Samuel Coleridge]] in Britain; [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]], Schelling and Hegel in Germany; [[Knut Hamsun]] in Norway; and [[Walt Whitman]], [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] and [[Henry David Thoreau]] in the United States. Seen as a growing threat by the Vatican, in 1864 it was formally condemned by [[Pope Pius IX]] in the ''[[Syllabus of Errors]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pope BI. Pius IX|title=Syllabus of Errors 1.1|url=http://www.papalencyclicals.net/Pius09/p9syll.htm|website=Papal Encyclicals Online|accessdate=28 July 2017|date=9 June 1862}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A letter written by [[William Herndon (lawyer)|William Herndon]], [[Abraham Lincoln]]'s law partner in 1886, was sold at auction for US$30,000 in 2011.&lt;ref name=Letter&gt;{{cite web|title=Sold – Herndon's Revelations on Lincoln's Religion|url=http://www.raabcollection.com/abraham-lincoln-autograph/Abraham-Lincoln-Autograph-Religion/|publisher=Raab Collection|accessdate=5 June 2012|first=William|last=Herndon|format=Excerpt and review|date=4 February 1866}}&lt;/ref&gt; In it, Herndon writes of the U.S. President's [[Abraham Lincoln and religion|evolving religious views]], which included pantheism.
{{quote|
"Mr. Lincoln's religion is too well known to me to allow of even a shadow of a doubt; he is or was a Theist and a Rationalist, denying all extraordinary – supernatural inspiration or revelation. At one time in his life, to say the least, he was an elevated Pantheist, doubting the immortality of the soul as the Christian world understands that term. He believed that the soul lost its identity and was immortal as a force. Subsequent to this he rose to the belief of a God, and this is all the change he ever underwent."&lt;ref name=Letter /&gt;&lt;ref name=Lincoln&gt;{{cite news|last=Adams|first=Guy|title='Pantheist' Lincoln would be unelectable today|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/pantheist-lincoln-would-be-unelectable-today-2269024.html|accessdate=5 June 2012|newspaper=The Independent|date=17 April 2011|authorlink=|location=Los Angeles}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The subject is understandably controversial, but the content of the letter is consistent with Lincoln's fairly lukewarm approach to organized religion.&lt;ref name=Lincoln /&gt;

====Comparison with non-Christian religions====
Some 19th-century theologians thought that various pre-Christian religions and philosophies were pantheistic. They thought Pantheism was  similar to the ancient Hindu&lt;ref name=Worman/&gt;{{rp|pp. 618}} philosophy of [[Advaita]] (non-dualism) to the extent that the 19th-century German Sanskritist [[Theodore Goldstücker]] remarked that Spinoza's thought was "... a western system of philosophy which occupies a foremost rank amongst the philosophies of all nations and ages, and which is so exact a representation of the ideas of the Vedanta, that we might have suspected its founder to have borrowed the fundamental principles of his system from the Hindus."&lt;ref&gt;Literary Remains of the Late Professor Theodore Goldstucker, W. H. Allen, 1879. p32.&lt;/ref&gt;

19th-century European theologians also considered Ancient Egyptian religion to contain pantheistic elements and pointed to Egyptian philosophy as a source of Greek Pantheism.&lt;ref name=Worman/&gt;{{rp|pp. 618–620}} The latter included some of the [[Presocratics]], such as [[Heraclitus]] and [[Anaximander]].&lt;ref&gt;Thilly, Frank, "Pantheism", in ''Encyclopedia of Religion and Ethics, Part 18'', Hastings, James (Ed.), Kessinger Publishing, 2003 (reprint, originally published 1908), p 614, {{ISBN|9780766136953}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Stoics]] were pantheists, beginning with [[Zeno of Citium]] and culminating in the emperor-philosopher [[Marcus Aurelius]]. During the pre-Christian Roman Empire, [[Stoicism]] was one of the three dominant schools of philosophy, along with [[Epicureanism]] and [[Neoplatonism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Armstrong|first=AH|title=The Cambridge History of Later Greek and Early Medieval Philosophy|year=1967|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978052104-0549|pages=57, 60, 161, 186, 222}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McLynn|first=Frank|title=Marcus Aurelius: A Life|year=2010|publisher=Da Capo Press|isbn=9780306819162|pages=232}}&lt;/ref&gt; The early [[Daoism|Taoism]] of [[Laozi]] and [[Zhuang Zhou|Zhuangzi]] is also sometimes considered pantheistic, although it could be more similar to [[Panentheism]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

[[Cheondoism]] and [[Won Buddhism]] which arose in the [[Joseon]] Dynasty of Korea is also considered pantheistic.

===20th century===
In a letter written to Eduard Büsching (25 October 1929), after Büsching sent [[Albert Einstein]] a copy of his book ''Es gibt keinen Gott''  ("There is no God"), Einstein wrote, "We followers of Spinoza see our God in the wonderful order and lawfulness of all that exists and in its soul [''Beseeltheit''] as it reveals itself in man and animal."&lt;ref name="Jammer"&gt;Jammer (2011), ''Einstein and Religion: Physics and Theology'', Princeton University Press, p.51; original at Einstein Archive, [http://alberteinstein.info/vufind1/Record/EAR000015602 reel 33-275]&lt;/ref&gt; According to Einstein, the book only dealt with the concept of a [[personal god]] and not the impersonal God of pantheism.&lt;ref name="Jammer" /&gt; In a letter written in 1954 to philosopher Eric Gutkind, Einstein wrote "the word God is for me nothing more than the expression and product of human weaknesses."&lt;ref name="weakness" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://de.richarddawkins.net/articles/der-einstein-gutkind-brief-mit-transkript-und-englischer-ubersetzung Richard Dawkins Foundation, ''Der Einstein-Gutkind Brief - Mit Transkript und Englischer Übersetzung]&lt;/ref&gt; In another letter written in 1954 he wrote "I do not believe in a personal God and I have never denied this but have expressed it clearly.".&lt;ref name="weakness"&gt;{{cite web| title=Belief in God a 'product of human weaknesses': Einstein letter| publisher=CBC Canada| date=13 May 2008 | url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/story/2008/05/13/einstein-religion.html| accessdate=31 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 20th century, some declared that pantheism was an underlying theology of [[Modern Paganism|Neopaganism]],&lt;ref&gt;Margot Adler, Drawing Down the Moon, Beacon Press, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; and pantheists began forming organizations devoted specifically to pantheism and treating it as a separate religion.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

In 2007, [[Dorion Sagan]], the son of famous scientist and science communicator, [[Carl Sagan]], published a book entitled ''Dazzle Gradually: Reflections on the Nature of Nature'' co-written with his mother, [[Lynn Margulis]]. In a chapter entitled, "Truth of My Father", he declares: "My father believed in the God of Spinoza and Einstein, God not behind nature, but as nature, equivalent to it."&lt;ref&gt;Sagan, Dorion, "Dazzle Gradually: Reflections on the Nature of Nature" 2007, p 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pantheism is mentioned in a [[Papal encyclical]] in 2009&lt;ref name=Caritas&gt;Caritas In Veritate, 7 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and a statement on New Year's Day in 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Message of His Holiness Pope Benedict XVI For The Celebration Of The World Day Of Peace|url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/messages/peace/documents/hf_ben-xvi_mes_20111208_xlv-world-day-peace_en.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; criticizing pantheism for denying the superiority of humans over nature and seeing the source of man{{'s}} salvation in nature.&lt;ref name=Caritas/&gt; In a review of the 2009 film ''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]]'', [[Ross Douthat]], an author, described pantheism as "Hollywood's religion of choice for a generation now".&lt;ref&gt;Heaven and Nature, Ross Douthat, New York Times, 20 December 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Los Angeles muralist [[Levi Ponce]] was commissioned to paint the 75-foot mural ''[http://www.publicartinpublicplaces.info/luminaries-of-pantheism-2015-by-levi-ponce Luminaries of Pantheism]'' on Ocean Front Walk in [[Venice, Los Angeles|Venice]], Los Angeles, California.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.publicartinpublicplaces.info/luminaries-of-pantheism-2015-by-levi-ponce|title="Luminaries of Pantheism" (2015) by Levi Ponce - PUBLIC ART IN PUBLIC PLACES|website=www.publicartinpublicplaces.info|access-date=2018-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization that commissioned the work, [[The Paradise Project]], is "dedicated to celebrating and spreading awareness about pantheism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rod|first=Perry|title=About the Paradise Project|url=https://pantheism.com/about/pantheismcom/|publisher=The Paradise Project|accessdate=21 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mural depicts [[Albert Einstein]], [[Alan Watts]], [[Baruch Spinoza]], [[Terence McKenna]], [[Carl Jung]], [[Carl Sagan]], [[Emily Dickinson]], [[Nikola Tesla]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]], [[W.E.B.

==Categorizations==
There are multiple varieties of pantheism&lt;ref name=Worman/&gt;&lt;ref name="Stanford"&gt;{{cite web|last=Levine|first=Michael|title=Pantheism|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/pantheism/|work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|3}} and various systems of classifying them relying upon one or more spectra or in discrete categories.

===Degree of determinism===
The philosopher [[Charles Hartshorne]] used the term [[Classical Pantheism]] to describe the [[deterministic]] philosophies of Baruch Spinoza, the Stoics, and other like-minded figures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Philosophers Speak of God|year=1953|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|pages=165–210|editor=Charles Hartshorne and William Reese}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pantheism (All-is-God) is often associated with [[monism]] (All-is-One) and some have suggested that it logically implies determinism (All-is-Now).&lt;ref name=Plumptre/&gt;&lt;ref name="Goldsmith"&gt;{{cite book|last=Goldsmith|first=Donald|title=E = Einstein: His Life, His Thought, and His Influence on Our Culture|year=2006|publisher=Stirling Publishing|location=New York|pages=187|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zGzcV40b3IkC&amp;pg=PA187|author2=Marcia Bartusiak|isbn=9781402763199}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;F.C.

This form of pantheism has been referred to as "extreme monism", in which{{spaced ndash}} in the words of one commentator{{spaced ndash}} "God decides or determines everything, including our supposed decisions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Religion: Volume 10|year=2005|publisher=MacMillan|location=USA|isbn=978-0028657332|edition=2nd|editor=Lindsay Jones}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other examples of determinism-inclined pantheisms include those of [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]],&lt;ref&gt;Dependence and Freedom: The Moral Thought of Horace Bushnell By David Wayne Haddorff [https://books.google.com/books?id=dL6_maZuNjYC&amp;pg=PA156&amp;lpg=PA156] Emerson's belief was "monistic determinism".

* Creatures of Prometheus: Gender and the Politics of Technology By Timothy Vance Kaufman-Osborn, Prometheus ((Writer)) [https://books.google.com/books?id=PZiLIEQzgHcC&amp;pg=PA28&amp;lpg=PA28] "Things are in a saddle, and ride mankind."
* Emerson's position is "soft determinism" (a variant of determinism) [https://books.google.com/books?id=ud2ZDts0RHsC&amp;pg=PA145&amp;lpg=PA145]
* "The 'fate' Emerson identifies is an underlying determinism." (Fate is one of Emerson's essays) [https://books.google.com/books?id=E1XhhYR2W6cC&amp;pg=PA443&amp;lpg=PA443]&lt;/ref&gt; and Hegel.&lt;ref&gt;"Hegel was a determinist" (also called a combatibilist a.k.a. soft determinist) [https://books.google.com/books?id=7tu1ZAJzl-sC&amp;pg=PA226&amp;lpg=PA226]
* "Hegel and Marx are usually cited as the greatest proponents of historical determinism" [https://books.google.com/books?id=OF_0c51R_VUC&amp;pg=PA238&amp;lpg=PA238]&lt;/ref&gt;

However, some have argued against treating every meaning of "unity" as an aspect of pantheism,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Levine|first=Michael P.|title=Pantheism, substance and unity|journal=International Journal for Philosophy of Religion|date=August 1992|volume=32|issue=1|pages=1–23|jstor=40036697|doi=10.1007/bf01313557}}&lt;/ref&gt; and there exist versions of pantheism that regard determinism as an inaccurate or incomplete view of nature. Examples include the beliefs of [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling]] and [[William James]].&lt;ref&gt;* Theories of the will in the history of philosophy By Archibald Alexander p 307 Schelling holds "...that the will is not determined but self-determined." [https://books.google.com/books?id=6cV9AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA305&amp;lpg=PA305]
* The Dynamic Individualism of William James by James O. Pawelski p 17 "[His] fight against determinism" "My first act of free will shall be to believe in free will." [https://books.google.com/books?id=-21UjntpjFkC&amp;pg=PA17&amp;lpg=PA17]
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Degree of belief===
It may also be possible to distinguish two types of pantheism, one being more religious and the other being more philosophical. The Columbia Encyclopedia writes of the distinction:
:"If the pantheist starts with the belief that the one great reality, eternal and infinite, is God, he sees everything finite and temporal as but some part of God. There is nothing separate or distinct from God, for God is the universe. If, on the other hand, the conception taken as the foundation of the system is that the great inclusive unity is the world itself, or the universe, God is swallowed up in that unity, which may be designated nature."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pantheism|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/pantheism|work=The Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia, Sixth Edition|publisher=Columbia University Press|accessdate=13 June 2012|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Form of monism===
[[File:Dualism-vs-Monism.png|thumb|right|A diagram with neutral monism compared to Cartesian dualism, physicalism and idealism.]]
Philosophers and theologians have often suggested that pantheism implies monism.&lt;ref name="Deity1"&gt;Owen, H. P. ''Concepts of Deity''. London: Macmillan, 1971, p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt; Different types of monism include:{{sfn|Urmson|1991|p=297}}&lt;ref name=Schaffer&gt;Schaffer, Jonathan, Monism: The Priority of the Whole, http://www.jonathanschaffer.org/monism.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

# [[Substance theory|Substance]] monism, "the view that the apparent plurality of substances is due to different states or appearances of a single substance"{{sfn|Urmson|1991|p=297}}
# Attributive monism, "the view that whatever the number of substances, they are of a single ultimate kind"{{sfn|Urmson|1991|p=297}}
# Partial monism, "within a given realm of being (however many there may be) there is only one substance"{{sfn|Urmson|1991|p=297}}
# Existence monism, the view that there is only one concrete object [[Type–token distinction|token]] (The One, "Τὸ Ἕν" or the [[Monad (philosophy)|Monad]]).&lt;ref&gt;Schaffer, Jonathan, "Monism", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Summer 2015 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2015/entries/monism/&lt;/ref&gt;
# Priority monism, "the whole is prior to its parts" or "the world has parts, but the parts are dependent fragments of an integrated whole."&lt;ref name="Schaffer"/&gt;
# Property monism: the view that all properties are of a single type (e.g. only physical properties exist)
# Genus monism: "the doctrine that there is a highest category; e.g., being" &lt;ref name="Schaffer"/&gt;

Views contrasting with monism are:
* [[Dualistic cosmology|Metaphysical dualism]], which asserts that there are two ultimately irreconcilable substances or realities such as Good and Evil, for example, [[Manichaeism]],{{sfn|Brugger|1972}}
* [[Pluralism (philosophy)|Metaphysical pluralism]], which asserts three or more fundamental substances or realities.{{sfn|Brugger|1972}}
* [[Nihilism]], negates any of the above categories (substances, properties, concrete objects, etc.).

Monism in modern [[philosophy of mind]] can be divided into three broad categories:
# [[Idealism|Idealist]], phenomenalism, or [[Mentalism (psychology)|mentalistic]] monism, which holds that only mind or spirit is real{{sfn|Brugger|1972}}
# [[Neutral monism]], which holds that one sort of thing fundamentally exists,{{sfn|Mandik|2010|p=76}} to which both the mental and the physical can be reduced&lt;ref name="mastin"&gt;[http://www.philosophybasics.com/branch_monism.html Luke Mastin (2008),''Monism'']&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[Material monism]] (also called [[Physicalism]] and materialism), which holds that only the physical is real, and that the mental or spiritual can be reduced to the physical{{sfn|Brugger|1972}}{{sfn|Mandik|2010|p=76}}
::a. [[Eliminativism|Eliminative Materialism]], according to which everything is physical and mental things do not exist{{sfn|Mandik|2010|p=76}}
::b. [[Reductive physicalism]], according to which mental things do exist and are a kind of physical thing{{sfn|Mandik|2010|p=76}}{{refn|group=note|Such as [[Behaviourism]],&lt;ref name="mastin" /&gt; [[Type-identity theory]]&lt;ref name="mastin" /&gt; and [[Functionalism (philosophy of mind)|Functionalism]]&lt;ref name="mastin" /&gt;}}

Certain positions do not fit easily into the above categories, such as functionalism, [[anomalous monism]], and [[reflexive monism]]. Moreover, they do not define the meaning of "real".

===Other===
In 1896, J. H. Worman, a theologian, identified seven categories of pantheism: Mechanical or materialistic (God the mechanical unity of existence); Ontological (fundamental unity, Spinoza); Dynamic; Psychical (God is the soul of the world); Ethical (God is the universal moral order, Fichte; Logical (Hegel); and Pure (absorption of God into nature, which Worman equates with atheism).&lt;ref name=Worman/&gt;

More recently, [[Paul D. Feinberg]], professor of biblical and systematic theology at Trinity Evangelical Divinity School, also identified seven: Hylozoistic; Immanentistic; Absolutistic monistic; Relativistic monistic; Acosmic; Identity of opposites; and Neoplatonic or emanationistic.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Evangelical Dictionary of Theology]]'', edited by Walter A. Elwell, p. 887&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nature worship]] or nature mysticism is often conflated and confused with pantheism. It is pointed out by at least one expert in pantheist philosophy that Spinoza's identification of God with nature is very different from a recent idea of a self identifying pantheist with environmental ethical concerns, Harold Wood, founder of the [[Universal Pantheist Society]]. His use of the word [[nature]] to describe his worldview may be vastly different from the "nature" of modern sciences. He and other nature mystics who also identify as pantheists use "nature" to refer to the limited [[natural environment]] (as opposed to man-made [[built environment]]). This use of "nature" is different from the broader use from Spinoza and other pantheists describing natural laws and the overall phenomena of the physical world. Nature mysticism may be compatible with pantheism but it may also be compatible with theism and other views.&lt;ref name="LevineDetailed"&gt;Levine, Michael, Pantheism: A Non-Theistic Concept of Deity, Psychology Press, 1994, {{ISBN|9780415070645}}, pgs 44, 274-275.
* "The idea that Unity that is rooted in nature is what types of nature mysticism (e.g. Wordsworth, Robinson Jeffers, Gary Snyder) have in common with more philosophically robust versions of pantheism. It is why nature mysticism and philosophical pantheism are often conflated and confused for one another."
* "[Wood's] pantheism is distant from Spinoza's identification of God with nature, and much closer to nature mysticism. In fact it is nature mysticism
* "Nature mysticism, however, is as compatible with theism as it is with pantheism."
&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nontheism]] is an umbrella term which has been used to refer to a variety of religions not fitting traditional theism, and under which pantheism has been included.&lt;ref name="LevineDetailed"/&gt;

[[Panentheism]] (from Greek πᾶν (pân) "all"; ἐν (en) "in"; and θεός (theós) "God"; "all-in-God") was formally coined in Germany in the 19th century in an attempt to offer a philosophical synthesis between traditional theism and pantheism, stating that God is substantially [[omnipresent]] in the physical universe but also exists "apart from" or "beyond" it as its Creator and Sustainer.&lt;ref name="Cooper"&gt;John W. Cooper, ''The Other God of the Philosophers'', Baker Academic, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p.27}} Thus panentheism separates itself from pantheism, positing the extra claim that God exists above and beyond the world as we know it.&lt;ref name="Levine"&gt;{{cite book|last=Levine|first=Michael Philip|title=Pantheism: A Non-Theistic Concept of Deity|year=1994|url=https://books.google.com/?id=HtS2TR8859sC&amp;pg=PR7#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|isbn=9780203014776|publisher=Psychology Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p.11}} The line between pantheism and panentheism can be blurred depending on varying definitions of God, so there have been disagreements when assigning particular notable figures to pantheism or panentheism.&lt;ref name="Cooper" /&gt;{{rp|pp. 71–72, 87–88, 105}}&lt;ref&gt;Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy: Genealogy to Iqbal edited by Edward Craig, pg 100 [https://books.google.com/books?id=5m5z_ca-qDkC&amp;printsec=frontcover].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pandeism]] is another word derived from pantheism, and is characterized as a combination of reconcilable elements of pantheism and [[deism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The History of Science: A Beginner's Guide|pages =90|author=Sean F. Johnston|year=2009|isbn= 978-1-85168-681-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; It assumes a Creator-deity that is at some point distinct from the universe and then transforms into it, resulting in a universe similar to the pantheistic one in present essence, but differing in origin.

[[Panpsychism]] is the philosophical view held by many pantheists that consciousness, mind, or soul is a universal feature of all things.&lt;ref&gt;Seager, William and Allen-Hermanson, Sean, "Panpsychism", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Winter 2012 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = &lt;http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2012/entries/panpsychism/
&lt;/ref&gt; Some pantheists also subscribe to the distinct philosophical views [[hylozoism]] (or panvitalism), the view that everything is alive, and its close neighbor [[animism]], the view that everything has a soul or spirit.&lt;ref&gt;Haught, John F. (1990). What Is Religion?: An Introduction. Paulist Press. p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pantheism in religion==

===Traditional religions===
Many traditional and folk religions including [[African traditional religions]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Parrinder|first=EG|title=Monotheism and Pantheism in Africa|journal=Journal of Religion in Africa|year=1970|volume=3|issue=2|pages=81–88|jstor=1594816|doi=10.1163/157006670x00099}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Native American religions]]{{sfn|Levine|1994|p=67}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Harrison|first=Paul|title=North American Indians: the spirituality of nature|url=http://www.pantheism.net/paul/history/native-americans.htm|publisher=World Pantheist Movement|accessdate=7 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; can be seen as pantheistic, or a mixture of pantheism and other doctrines such as [[polytheism]] and animism.

Ideas resembling pantheism existed in East/South Asian religions before the 18th century (notably [[Sikhism]], Hinduism, [[Confucianism]], and [[Taoism]]). Although there is no evidence that these influenced Spinoza's work, there is such evidence regarding other contemporary philosophers, such as Leibniz, and later Voltaire.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|jstor = 1397760|title = Leibniz's Interpretation of Neo-Confucianism|journal = Philosophy East and West|volume = 21|issue = 1|pages = 3|last1 = Mungello|first1 = David E|doi = 10.2307/1397760|year = 1971}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lan, Feng (2005). ''Ezra Pound and Confucianism: remaking humanism in the face of modernity''. University of Toronto Press. p. 190. {{ISBN|978-0-8020-8941-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of Hinduism, pantheistic views exist alongside panentheistic, polytheistic, monotheistic, and atheistic ones.{{sfn|Fowler|1997|p=2}}{{sfn|Fowler|2002|p=15-32}}{{sfn|Long|2011|p=128}} In the case of [[Sikhism]], stories attributed to [[Guru Nanak]] suggest that he believed God was everywhere in the physical world, and the Sikh tradition typically describes God as the preservative force within the physical world, present in all material forms, each created as a manifestation of God. However, Sikhs view God as the transcendent creator,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Singh|first1=Nikky-Guninder Kaur|title=The Myth of the Founder: The Janamsākhīs and Sikh Tradition|journal=History of Religions|date=1992|volume=31|issue=4|pages=329–343}}&lt;/ref&gt; "immanent in the phenomenal reality of the world in the same way in which an artist can be said to be present in his art".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ahluwalia|first1=Jasbir Singh|title=Anti-Feudal Dialectic of Sikhism|journal=Social Scientist|date=March 1974|volume=2|issue=8|pages=22|jstor=3516312|doi=10.2307/3516312}}&lt;/ref&gt; This implies a more panentheistic position.

===Spirituality and new religious movements===
Pantheism is popular in modern spirituality and [[new religious movement]]s, such as Neopaganism and [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;Carpenter, Dennis D. (1996). "Emergent Nature Spirituality: An Examination of the Major Spiritual Contours of the Contemporary Pagan Worldview". In Lewis, James R., ''Magical Religion and Modern Witchcraft''. Albany: State University of New York Press. {{ISBN|978-0-7914-2890-0}}. p 50&lt;/ref&gt; Two organizations that specify the word pantheism in their title formed in the last quarter of the 20th century. The Universal Pantheist Society, open to all varieties of pantheists and supportive of environmental causes, was founded in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Home page|url=http://www.pantheist.net/|publisher=Universal Pantheist Society|accessdate=8 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[World Pantheist Movement]] is headed by [[Paul Harrison (pantheist)|Paul Harrison]], an environmentalist, writer and a former vice president of the Universal Pantheist Society, from which he resigned in 1996. The World Pantheist Movement was incorporated in 1999 to focus exclusively on promoting [[naturalistic pantheism]] - a strict [[metaphysical naturalism|metaphysical naturalistic]] version of pantheism,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=World Pantheist Movement|title=Naturalism and Religion: can there be a naturalistic &amp; scientific spirituality?|url=http://www.pantheism.net/natural.htm|accessdate=4 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; considered by some a form of [[religious naturalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stone|first=Jerome Arthur|title=Religious Naturalism Today: The Rebirth of a Forgotten Alternative|year=2008|publisher=State University of New York Press|location=Albany|isbn=978-0791475379|pages=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been described as an example of "dark green religion" with a focus on [[environmental ethics]].&lt;ref name="Dark Green"&gt;Bron Raymond Taylor, "Dark Green Religion: Nature Spirituality and the Planetary Future", University of California Press 2010, pp 159–160.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Philip Edward Bertrand Jourdain''' (16 October 1879 – 1 October 1919) was a British [[logician]] and follower of [[Bertrand Russell]].

He was born in [[Ashbourne, Derbyshire|Ashbourne]] in Derbyshire&lt;ref&gt;*{{MacTutor Biography|id=Jourdain}}&lt;/ref&gt; one of a large family belonging to Emily Clay and his father  Francis Jourdain (who was the vicar at Ashbourne).&lt;ref name=turn/&gt; He was partly disabled by [[Friedreich's ataxia]]. He corresponded with [[Georg Cantor]] and [[Gottlob Frege]], and took a close interest in the paradoxes related to [[Russell's paradox]], formulating the [[card paradox]] version of the [[liar paradox]].&lt;ref name=turn&gt;[http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Biographies/Jourdain.html Turnbull archive] accessed 7 December 2007&lt;/ref&gt; He corresponded with [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], meeting with him in Cambridge to discuss Frege's book [[Grundgesetze der Arithmetik]], of parts of which Jourdain had prepared a translation. He also worked on [[algebraic logic]], and the [[history of science]] with [[Isaac Newton]] as a particular study. He was London editor for ''[[The Monist]]''. Near the end of his life he became increasingly obsessed by trying to prove the [[axiom of choice]], and published several incorrect proofs of it. {{harvtxt|Littlewood|1986|loc=p.129}} describes Jourdain on his deathbed still arguing with him about his (incorrect) proof of the axiom of choice. 

His sister [[Eleanor Jourdain]] was an English academic and author. Another sister, Margaret (1876-1951), was an authority on the history of fine English home-furnishings, and the life-long companion of the novelist Ivy Compton-Burnett.

{{Philosophy sidebar}}

In [[philosophy]], '''philosophy of physics''' deals with conceptual and interpretational issues in modern [[physics]], and often overlaps with research done by certain kinds of theoretical physicists. Philosophy of physics can be very broadly lumped into three main areas:
* The interpretations of [[quantum mechanics]]: Concerning issues, mainly, with how to formulate an adequate response to the [[measurement problem]], and understand what the theory tells us about reality.
* The nature of [[space]] and [[time]]: Are space and time substances, or purely relational? Is simultaneity conventional or just relative? Is temporal asymmetry purely reducible to thermodynamic asymmetry?
* Inter-theoretic relations: the relationship between various physical theories, such as [[thermodynamics]] and [[statistical mechanics]]. This overlaps with the issue of scientific reduction.

==Philosophy of space and time==
{{main article|Philosophy of space and time}}

The existence and nature of space and time (or space-time) are central topics in the philosophy of physics.&lt;ref name="MaudlinSTa"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Maudlin|first1=Tim|title=Philosophy of Physics: Space and Time|date=2012|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0691143095|page=xi|url=https://books.google.com/?id=siyNQV8F0y8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=philosophy+of+Physics:+Space+and+Time:+Space+and+Time#v=onepage&amp;q=central%20topic&amp;f=false|accessdate=3 October 2017|language=en|quote=...the existence and nature of space and time (or space-time) is a central topic.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Time===
{{Main article| Time in physics}}
[[File:Wooden hourglass.jpg|thumb|right|Time, in many philosophies, is seen as change.]]
[[Time]] is often thought to be a [[fundamental quantity]] (that is, a quantity which cannot be defined in terms of other quantities), because time seems like a fundamentally basic concept, such that one cannot define it in terms of anything simpler. However, certain theories such as [[loop quantum gravity]] claim that spacetime is emergent. As Carlo Rovelli, one of the founders of loop quantum gravity has said: "No more fields on spacetime: just fields on fields".&lt;ref&gt;Rovelli, C. (2004). Quantum Gravity. Cambridge Monographs on Mathematical Physics. p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt; Time is [[define]]d via measurement—by its standard time interval. Currently, the standard time interval (called "conventional [[second]]", or simply "second") is defined as 9,192,631,770 [[oscillations]] of a [[hyperfine]] transition in the 133 [[caesium]] [[atom]]. ([[ISO 31-1]]). What time is and how it works [[Logical consequence|follows from]] the above definition. Time then can be combined mathematically with the fundamental quantities of [[space]] and [[mass]] to define concepts such as [[velocity]], [[momentum]], [[energy]], and [[Field (physics)|fields]].

Both [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] and [[Galileo]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Roger Penrose]], 2004. ''[[The Road to Reality]]: A Complete Guide to the Laws of the Universe''. London: Jonathan Cape. {{ISBN|0-224-04447-8}} (hardcover), 0-09-944068-7 (paperback).
&lt;/ref&gt;
as well as most people up until the 20th century, thought that time was the same for everyone everywhere.
Our modern conception of time is based on [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]'s [[theory of relativity]] and [[Hermann Minkowski|Minkowski]]'s [[spacetime]], in which rates of time run differently in different inertial frames of reference, and [[space]] and time are merged into [[spacetime]]. Time may be quantized, with the theoretical smallest time being on the order of the [[Planck time]]. Einstein's [[general relativity]] as well as the [[redshift]] of the light from receding distant galaxies indicate that the entire [[Universe]] and possibly space-time itself began about [[Age of the universe|13.8 billion years ago]] in the [[big bang]]. Einstein's theory of special relativity mostly (though not universally) made theories of time where there is something metaphysically special about the present seem much less plausible, as the reference-frame-dependence of time seems to not allow the idea of a privileged present moment.

===Time travel===
{{Main article| Time travel}}
Some theories, most notably special and general relativity, suggest that suitable geometries of [[spacetime]], or certain types of motion in [[space]], may allow time travel into the past and future. Concepts that aid such understanding include the [[closed timelike curve]].

[[Albert Einstein]]'s special theory of relativity (and, by extension, the general theory) predicts [[time dilation]] that could be interpreted as time travel. The theory states that, relative to a stationary observer, time appears to pass more slowly for faster-moving bodies: for example, a moving clock will appear to run slow; as a clock approaches the speed of light its hands will appear to nearly stop moving. The effects of this sort of time dilation are discussed further in the popular "[[twin paradox]]".  These results are experimentally observable and affect the operation of GPS satellites and other high-tech systems used in daily life.

A second, similar type of time travel is permitted by [[general relativity]]. In this type a distant observer sees time passing more slowly for a clock at the bottom of a deep [[gravity well]], and a clock lowered into a deep gravity well and pulled back up will indicate that less time has passed compared to a stationary clock that stayed with the distant observer.

These effects are to some degree similar to [[hibernation]], or cooling of live objects (which slow down the rates of chemical processes in the subject) almost indefinitely suspending their life thus resulting in "time travel" toward the future, but never backward. They do not violate [[causality]]. This is not typical of the "time travel" featured in science fiction (where causality is violated at will), and there is little doubt surrounding its existence. "Time travel" will hereafter refer to travel with some degree of freedom into the past ''or'' future of [[proper time]].

Many in the scientific community believe that backward time travel is highly unlikely, because it violates [[causality]]&lt;ref name="Bolonkin"&gt;{{cite book |title=Universe, Human mmortality and Future Human Evaluation |edition= |first1=Alexander |last1=Bolonkin |publisher=Elsevier |year=2011 |isbn=978-0-12-415810-8 |page=32 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IFZWTf93KwgC}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=IFZWTf93KwgC&amp;pg=PA32 Extract of page 32]&lt;/ref&gt; i.e. the logic of cause and effect. For example, what happens if you attempt to go back in time and kill yourself at an earlier stage in your life (or your grandfather, which leads to the [[grandfather paradox]])? [[Stephen Hawking]] once suggested that the absence of tourists from the future constitutes a strong argument against the existence of time travel&amp;mdash; a variant of the [[Fermi paradox]], with time travelers instead of alien visitors.&lt;ref name="Bolonkin" /&gt;

===Space===
{{Main article|Space}}

Space is one of the few fundamental quantities in [[physics]], meaning that it cannot be defined via other quantities because there is nothing more fundamental known at present. Thus, similar to the definition of other fundamental quantities (like [[time]] and [[mass]]), space is defined via [[measurement]]. Currently, the standard space interval, called a standard metre or simply metre, is defined as the [[speed of light|distance traveled by light in a vacuum]] during a time interval of 1/299792458 of a second (exact).

In [[classical physics]], space is a three-dimensional [[Euclidean space]] where any position can be described using three [[coordinate system|coordinate]]s and parameterised by time.  Special and general relativity use four-dimensional [[spacetime]] rather than three-dimensional space; and currently there are many speculative theories which use more than four spatial dimensions.

==Philosophy of quantum mechanics==
{{Main article|Interpretation of quantum mechanics}}
Quantum mechanics is a large focus of contemporary philosophy of physics, specifically concerning the correct interpretation of quantum mechanics. Very broadly, much of the philosophical work that is done in quantum theory is trying to make sense of superposition states:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8k_2oD66mI&amp;t=128|title=Eleanor Knox (KCL) - The Curious Case of the Vanishing  Spacetime|first=|last=BristolPhilosophy|date=19 February 2013|publisher=|accessdate=7 April 2018|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; the property that particles seem to not just be in one determinate position at one time, but are somewhere 'here', and also 'there' at the same time. Such a radical view turns a lot of our common sense metaphysical ideas on their head. Much of contemporary philosophy of quantum mechanics aims to make sense of what the very empirically successful formalism of quantum mechanics tells us about the physical world.

===The Everett Interpretation===
{{Main article|Many-worlds interpretation}}
The Everett, or many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics claims that the [[wave-function]] of a quantum system is telling us claims about the reality of that physical system. It denies [[wavefunction collapse]], and claims that [[superposition principle|superposition]] states should be interpreted literally as describing the reality of many-worlds where objects are located, and not simply indicating the indeterminacy of those variables. This is sometimes argued as a corollary of [[scientific realism]],&lt;ref&gt;David Wallace, 'The Emergent Multiverse', p.1-10&lt;/ref&gt; which states that scientific theories aim to give us literally true descriptions of the world.

One issue for the Everett interpretation is the role that probability plays on this account. The Everettian account is completely deterministic, whereas probability seems to play an ineliminable role in quantum mechanics.&lt;ref&gt;David Wallace, 'The Emergent Multiverse', pg. 113-117&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary Everettians have argued that one can get an account of probability that follows the Born Rule through certain decision-theoretic proofs.&lt;ref&gt;David Wallace, 'The Emergent Multiverse', pg. 157-189&lt;/ref&gt;

Physicist Roland Omnés noted that it is impossible to experimentally differentiate between Everett's view, which says that as the wave-function decoheres into distinct worlds, each of which exists equally, and the more traditional view that says that a decoherent wave-function leaves only one unique real result. Hence, the dispute between the two views represents a great "chasm." "Every characteristic of reality has reappeared in its reconstruction by our theoretical model; every feature except one: the uniqueness of facts."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Omnès|first1=Roland|title=Quantum philosophy : understanding and interpreting contemporary science|date=2002|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton|isbn=978-1400822867|page=213|edition=First paperback printing, 2002, translated by Arturo Spangalli.|language=French|chapter=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Uncertainty principle===
{{Main article|Uncertainty principle}}
The [[uncertainty principle]] is a mathematical relation asserting an upper limit to the accuracy of the simultaneous measurement of any pair of [[conjugate variables]], e.g. position and momentum. In the formalism of [[Operator (physics)#Operators in quantum mechanics|operator notation]], this limit is the evaluation of the [[Canonical commutation relation|commutator]] of the variables' corresponding operators.

The uncertainty principle arose as an answer to the question: How does one measure the location of an electron around a nucleus if an electron is a wave?  When quantum mechanics was developed, it was seen to be a relation between the classical and quantum descriptions of a system using wave mechanics.

In March 1927, working in [[Niels Bohr]]'s institute, [[Werner Heisenberg]] formulated the principle of uncertainty thereby laying the foundation of what became known as the [[Copenhagen interpretation]] of quantum mechanics. Heisenberg had been studying the papers of [[Paul Dirac]] and [[Pascual Jordan]].  He discovered a problem with measurement of basic variables in the equations. His analysis showed that uncertainties, or imprecisions, always turned up if one tried to measure the position and the momentum of a particle at the same time. Heisenberg concluded that these uncertainties or imprecisions in the measurements were not the fault of the experimenter, but fundamental in nature and are inherent mathematical properties of operators in quantum mechanics arising from definitions of these operators.&lt;ref&gt;Niels Bohr, ''Atomic Physics and Human Knowledge, p. 38&lt;/ref&gt;

The term Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics was often used interchangeably with and as a synonym for Heisenberg's uncertainty principle by detractors (such as Einstein and the physicist [[Alfred Landé]]) who believed in [[determinism]] and saw the common features of the Bohr–Heisenberg theories as a threat. Within the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics the uncertainty principle was taken to mean that on an elementary level, the physical universe does not exist in a deterministic form, but rather as a collection of probabilities, or possible outcomes. For example, the pattern ([[probability distribution]]) produced by millions of photons passing through a diffraction slit can be calculated using quantum mechanics, but the exact path of each photon cannot be predicted by any known method. The Copenhagen interpretation holds that it cannot be predicted by any method, not even with theoretically infinitely precise measurements.

==History of the philosophy of physics==
===Aristotelian physics===
[[Aristotelian physics]] viewed the universe as a [[Sublunary sphere|sphere]] with a center. Matter, composed of the [[classical element#Greece|classical elements]], earth, water, air, and fire, sought to go down towards the center of the universe, the center of the earth, or up, away from it. Things in the [[Aether (classical element)|aether]] such as the moon, the sun, planets, or stars circled the center of the universe.&lt;ref name = MaudlinPPST3 &gt;[[Tim Maudlin]] (2012-07-22). ''Philosophy of Physics: Space and Time: Space and Time'' (Princeton Foundations of Contemporary Philosophy) (p. 3). Princeton University Press. Kindle Edition."Because it is a sphere, Aristotle's universe contains a geometrically privileged center, and Aristotle makes reference to that center in characterizing the natural motions of different sorts of matter. “Upward,”“downward,” and “uniform circular motion” all are defined in terms of the center of the universe."&lt;/ref&gt; Movement is defined as change in place,&lt;ref name = MaudlinPPST3 /&gt; i.e. space.&lt;ref name = MaudlinPPST4 &gt;[[Tim Maudlin]] (2012-07-22). ''Philosophy of Physics: Space and Time: Space and Time'' (Princeton Foundations of Contemporary Philosophy) (p. 4). Princeton University Press. Kindle Edition.  "Aristotle adopts the concept of space, and the correlative concept of motion, that we all intuitively employ."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Newtonian physics===
The implicit axioms of Aristotelian physics with respect to movement of matter in space were superseded in [[Classical mechanics|Newtonian physics]] by [[Isaac Newton|Newton's]] [[Newton's laws of motion#Newton's first law|First Law of Motion]].&lt;ref name = MaudlinPPST3-4 &gt;[[Tim Maudlin]] (2012-07-22). ''Philosophy of Physics: Space and Time: Space and Time'' (Princeton Foundations of Contemporary Philosophy) (pp. 4-5). Princeton University Press. Kindle Edition. "Newtonian physics is implicit in his First Law of Motion: Law I : Every body perseveres in its state either of rest or of uniform motion in a straight line, except insofar as it is compelled to change its state by impressed forces. 1 This single law smashes the Aristotelian universe to smithereens."&lt;/ref&gt;{{cquote|Every body perseveres in its state either of rest or of uniform motion in a straight line, except insofar as it is compelled to change its state by impressed forces.}}
"Every body" includes the Moon, and an apple; and includes all types of matter, air as well as water, stones, or even a flame. Nothing has a natural or inherent motion.&lt;ref name = MaudlinPPST5&gt;[[Tim Maudlin]] (2012-07-22). ''Philosophy of Physics: Space and Time: Space and Time'' (Princeton Foundations of Contemporary Philosophy) (pp. 5). Princeton University Press. Kindle Edition.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Absolute time and space|Absolute space]] being [[three-dimensional space|three-dimensional]] [[Euclidean space]], infinite and without a center.&lt;ref name = MaudlinPPST5 /&gt; Being "at rest" means being at the same place in absolute space over time.&lt;ref name = MaudlinPPST9-10  &gt;[[Tim Maudlin]] (2012-07-22). ''Philosophy of Physics: Space and Time: Space and Time'' (Princeton Foundations of Contemporary Philosophy) (pp. 9-10). Princeton University Press. Kindle Edition. "Newton believed in the existence of a spatial arena with the geometrical structure of E{{smallsup|3}}. He believed that this infinite three-dimensional space exists at every moment of time. And he also believed something much more subtle and controversial, namely, that identically the same points of space persist through time."&lt;/ref&gt; The [[topology]] and [[Affine space|affine structure]] of space must permit movement in a [[Line (geometry)|straight line]] at a uniform velocity; thus both space and time must have [[Absolute time and space|definite, stable dimensions]].&lt;ref name = Maudlin12 &gt;[[Tim Maudlin]] (2012-07-22). ''Philosophy of Physics: Space and Time: Space and Time'' (Princeton Foundations of Contemporary Philosophy) (p. 12). Princeton University Press. Kindle Edition. "...space must have a topology, an affine structure, and a metric; time must be one-dimensional with a topology and a metric; and, most importantly, the individual parts of space must persist through time.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Leibniz===
[[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]], 1646 – 1716, was a contemporary of Newton. He contributed a fair amount to the statics and dynamics emerging around him, often disagreeing with [[Descartes]] and [[Isaac Newton|Newton]]. He devised a new theory of [[Motion (physics)|motion]] ([[Dynamics (mechanics)|dynamics]]) based on [[kinetic energy]] and [[potential energy]], which posited space as relative, whereas Newton was thoroughly convinced that space was absolute. An important example of Leibniz's mature physical thinking is his ''Specimen Dynamicum'' of 1695.&lt;ref&gt;Ariew and Garber 117, Loemker §46, W II.5. On Leibniz and physics, see the chapter by Garber in Jolley (1995) and Wilson (1989).&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the discovery of subatomic particles and the [[quantum mechanics]] governing them, many of Leibniz's speculative ideas about aspects of nature not reducible to statics and dynamics made little sense. For instance, he anticipated [[Albert Einstein]] by arguing, against Newton, that [[space]], [[time]] and motion are relative, not absolute:&lt;ref name=Ferraro&gt;{{cite book |title =Einstein's Space-Time: An Introduction to Special and General Relativity|page= 1| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wa3CskhHaIgC&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=time+%22absolute+space%22|author=Rafael Ferraro |isbn=978-0-387-69946-2 |publisher=Springer |year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; "As for my own opinion, I have said more than once, that I hold space to be something merely relative, as time is, that I hold it to be an order of coexistences, as time is an order of successions."&lt;ref&gt;See H. G. Alexander, ed., ''The [[Leibniz-Clarke Correspondence]]'', Manchester: Manchester University Press, pp. 25–26.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Quotes from Einstein's work on the importance of the philosophy of physics===
[[File:Albert Einstein photo 1921.jpg|thumb|left|Einstein was interested in the philosophical implications of his theory.]]
[[Albert Einstein]] was extremely interested in the philosophical conclusions of his work. He writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"I fully agree with you about the significance and educational value of [[methodology]] as well as [[history of science|history]] and [[philosophy of science]]. So many people today—and even professional scientists—seem to me like somebody who has seen thousands of trees but has never seen a forest. A knowledge of the historic and philosophical background gives that kind of independence from [[prejudice]]s of his generation from which most scientists are suffering. This independence created by philosophical insight is—in my opinion—the mark of distinction between a mere artisan or specialist and a real seeker after truth." [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]. letter to Robert A. Thornton, 7 December 1944. ''EA'' 61-574.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Elsewhere:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"How does it happen that a properly endowed [[natural sciences|natural scientist]] comes to concern himself with [[epistemology]]? Is there no more valuable work in his specialty? I hear many of my colleagues saying, and I sense it from many more, that they feel this way. I cannot share this sentiment. ... Concepts that have proven useful in ordering things easily achieve such an authority over us that we forget their earthly origins and accept them as unalterable givens. Thus they come to be stamped as 'necessities of thought,' 'a priori givens,' etc."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The path of scientific advance is often made impassable for a long time through such errors. For that reason, it is by no means an idle game if we become practiced in analyzing the long-commonplace concepts and exhibiting [revealing, exposing? -Ed.] those circumstances upon which their justification and usefulness depend, how they have grown up, individually, out of the givens of experience. By this means, their all-too-great authority will be broken." [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]], 1916, "Memorial notice for [[Ernst Mach]]," ''Physikalische Zeitschrift'' 17: 101-02.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:ChaadaevPetr2.jpg|thumb|Pyotr Chaadayev]]
'''Pyotr''' or '''Petr Yakovlevich Chaadayev''' ({{lang-ru|Пётр Я́ковлевич Чаада́ев}}; also spelled '''Chaadaev''', or '''Čaadajev'''; June 7 [May 27, [[Old Style]]], 1794 – April 26 [April 14, O.S.], 1856) was a [[Russians|Russian]] [[philosopher]]. He was one of the [[Russian Schellingians]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'' (1998): [https://www.rep.routledge.com/articles/thematic/schellingianism-russian/v-1/sections/schellingian-philosophies-of-history "Schellingianism, Russian"].&lt;/ref&gt;

Chaadayev wrote eight "Philosophical Letters"&lt;ref name="demons" /&gt; about [[Russia]] in [[French language|French]] between 1826-1831, which circulated in [[Russian Empire|Russia]] as manuscript for many years. His works, that are generally an admiration of the West as opposed to the straggling Russia, lagging far behind the [[Western civilization]], were considered unsound at his time and eventually were banned by the Russian imperial authorities (though some were published before the persecution began). Because there was nothing to charge him with, Chaadayev was declared [[legally insane]] and put under constant medical supervision, though this was a formality rather than a real administrative abuse.

==Life==
Chaadayev was born and died in [[Moscow]]. His surname is probably derived from the Turkic word Chaadai.&lt;ref name="Saunders"&gt;{{cite book|author=J. J. Saunders|title=The History of the Mongol Conquests|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nFx3OlrBMpQC&amp;pg=PA247&amp;dq=Chaadayev+turkic+name&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjV_8O77bfQAhUMDywKHbgyDmEQ6AEIKzAD#v=onepage&amp;q=Chaadayev%20turkic%20name&amp;f=false|year=2001|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|isbn=978-0-8122-1766-7|page=247}}&lt;/ref&gt; More generally, it's assumed that he was of [[Tatar people|Tatar]] descent,&lt;ref&gt;Charles J. Halperin, ''Russia and the Golden Horde: The Mongol Impact on Medieval Russian History'', Indiana University Press (1987), p. 112&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stefan Berger &amp; Alexei Miller, ''Nationalizing Empires'', Central European University Press (2015), p. 312&lt;/ref&gt; with the name deriving from [[Chagatai Khan|Chagatay]], the second son of [[Genghis Khan]].&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Riha, ''Readings in Russian Civilization, Volume 1: Russia Before Peter the Great, 900-1700'', University of Chicago Press (2009), p. 191&lt;/ref&gt; After leaving [[Moscow State University|Moscow University]] without completing his course in 1812, he entered the army and served in the [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleonic Wars]].  Chaadaev's first hand observation of Tsar [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander]]'s reaction to a revolt in the Semenovsky regiment may have led to his resignation from service in 1820.  From 1823 to 1826 he travelled in Europe, so that he was out of Russia during the [[Decembrist revolt|Decembrist]] insurrection, though he was questioned on his return about his connections with many of the Decembrists.  These connections may have contributed to his failure to find a position in the new government of [[Nicholas I of Russia|Nicholas I]].

During the 1840s Chaadayev was an active participant in the [[Moscow]] literary circles. He befriended [[Alexander Pushkin]] and was a model for [[Woe from Wit|Chatsky]], the chief protagonist of [[Alexander Griboyedov]]'s play ''[[Woe from Wit]]'' (1824).

==Philosophy==
The main thesis of his famous ''Philosophical Letters'' was that Russia had lagged behind Western countries and had contributed nothing to the world's progress and concluded that Russia must start de novo. As a result, they included criticism of Russia's intellectual isolation and social backwardness.&lt;ref name="demons"&gt;{{Citation|title=Commentaries on Demons by Fyodor Dostoevsky|journal=Soviet Academy of Sciences|publication-place=New York|place=Leningrad|publisher=Alfred A. Knopf, Inc.|publication-date=1994|editor-last=Pevear|editor-first=Richard|editor2-last=Volokhonsky|editor2-first=Larissa|year=1975|volume=12|page=715|isbn=0-679-42314-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When in 1836 the first edition (and only one published during his life)&lt;ref name="demons" /&gt; of the philosophical letters was published in the Russian magazine Telescope, its editor was exiled to the Far North of Russia. The [[Slavophile]]s at first mistook Chaadayev for one of them, but later, on realizing their mistake, bitterly denounced and disclaimed him. Chaadayev fought Slavophilism all of his life. His first Philosophical Letter has been labeled the "opening shot" of the [[Slavophile|Westernizer-Slavophile]] controversy which was dominant in Russian social thought of the nineteenth century.&lt;ref name="demons" /&gt; He wrote in his "first letter":

{{Quotation|1=We are an exception among people. We belong to those who are not an integral part of humanity but exist only to teach the world some type of great lesson.}}

The strikingly uncomplimentary views of Russia in the first philosophical letter caused their author to be declared "clinically insane" because he criticized the regime of Tsar Nicholas I. The 1836 case of Pyotr is believed to be the first recorded incident where psychiatry was used in Russia to suppress dissent.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gordon Thomas (author)|Gordon Thomas]], ''[[Journey Into Madness: Medical Torture and the Mind Controllers]]'' (1988)&lt;/ref&gt;

Living under house arrest following his declaration of insanity, Chaadayev next work was entitled, fittingly, "Apologie d'un Fou" [which has been translated as "Apology of a Madman" but may better be translated as "Apologia of a Madman"] (1837).  It opens with a quote from Samuel Coleridge stating "O my brethren!  I have told/ Most bitter truth, but without bitterness."&lt;ref&gt;Peter Iakovlevich Chaadaev, Sochineniia i pis'ma, ed M. Gershenzon, Moscow, 1913&lt;/ref&gt; 
In this brilliant but uncompleted work he maintained that Russia must follow her inner lines of development if she was to be true to her historical mission.

His ideas influenced both the Westerners (who supported bringing Russian into accord with developments in Europe by way of various degrees of liberal reform) and Slavophiles (who supported Russian Orthodoxy and national culture.)&lt;ref name="demons" /&gt;

Most of his works have been edited by his biographer, [[Mikhail Gershenzon]] (two volumes, Moscow, 1913–14), whose excellent little study of the [[Philosophy|philosopher]] was published at [[Saint Petersburg|St. Petersburg]] in 1908.

==Life==

Quentin Smith was born in Rhinebeck, New York. His father was a psychology professor at Bennington College and he spent most of his early life in Canada.  He received his bachelor's degree in philosophy from Antioch College, advancing to receive a PhD in philosophy from Boston College.

The '''''Shidduch crisis''''' is a commonly observed and discussed&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mishpacha.com/uploads/pdf/rechnitz.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amazon.ca/The-Shidduch-Crisis-Causes-Cures/dp/9655240061&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mikvah"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mikvah.org/article/shidduch_crisis|title=Shidduch Crisis - Mikvah.org - Mivtza Taharas Hamishpacha|publisher=mikvah.org|accessdate=2016-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; phenomenon in the [[Orthodox Jewish]] community whereby eligible single persons, especially women, have difficulty finding a suitable spouse, or a [[shidduch]]. A debate exists as to whether the crisis actually exists or is a new phenomenon.&lt;ref name="thelakewoodscoop"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thelakewoodscoop.com/news/2012/12/opinion-there-is-no-shidduch-crisis-mazal-tov.html|title=The Lakewood Scoop &amp;raquo; Opinion: There is NO Shidduch Crisis &amp;#8211; Mazal Tov! &amp;raquo; The heartbeat of the lakewood community|publisher=thelakewoodscoop.com|accessdate=2016-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Causes and solutions ==
Several causes have been cited for the shidduch crisis, but it is most commonly attributed to the average age gap between Orthodox Jewish women and men at which they get married.&lt;ref name="yated"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yated.com/understanding-the-shidduch-crisis-answering-the-nisayon.0-1090-7-.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518102424/http://www.yated.com/understanding-the-shidduch-crisis-answering-the-nisayon.0-1090-7-.html |archive-date=2015-05-18 |dead-url=yes|title=Yated Newspaper - Understanding The Shidduch Crisis-Answering The Nisayon|accessdate=2016-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this is widely disputed.&lt;ref name="matzav"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://matzav.com/the-matzav-shmoooze-why-solving-the-shidduch-crisis-with-the-age-gap-misses-the-boat|title=The Matzav Shmoooze: Why Solving the Shidduch Crisis With the Age Gap Misses the Boat &amp;#124; Matzav.com|author=ralph|publisher=matzav.com|accessdate=2016-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="blogspot"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thepartialview.blogspot.ca/2013/08/the-shidduch-crisis-is-not-result-of.html|title=The Partial View: The Shidduch crisis is not a result of the age gap or numbers.|publisher=thepartialview.blogspot.ca|accessdate=2016-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://orthonomics.blogspot.com/2010/05/guest-post-age-gap-theory.html&lt;/ref&gt; Several initiatives in various Orthodox Jewish communities exist which try to close the age gap by offering rewards for [[shadchanim]] who set up men with women of the same age or older.&lt;ref name="shidduchproject"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://shidduchproject.com/project/nasi-project/|title=The Shidduch Project &amp;#8211; NASI Project|publisher=shidduchproject.com|accessdate=2016-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hakuyū Taizan Maezumi''' ({{lang|ja|前角 博雄}} Maezumi Hakuyū, February 24, 1931–May 15, 1995) was a [[Japanese people|Japanese]] [[Zen|Zen Buddhist]] teacher and [[rōshi]], and lineage holder in the [[Sōtō]], [[Rinzai school|Rinzai]], and [[Sanbo Kyodan]] traditions of Zen. He combined the Rinzai use of ''[[kōan]]''s and the Sōtō emphasis on ''[[shikantaza]]'' in his teachings, influenced by his years studying under [[Hakuun Yasutani]] in Sanbo Kyodan. He founded or co-founded several institutions and practice centers, including the [[Zen Center of Los Angeles]], [[White Plum Asanga]], [[Yokoji Zen Mountain Center]] and the [[Zen Mountain Monastery]].

Taizan Maezumi left behind twelve [[Dharma transmission|dharma successors]], appointed sixty-eight priests and gave [[Five Precepts|Buddhist precepts]] to more than five hundred practitioners. Along with Zen teachers like [[Shunryū Suzuki]], [[Seungsahn]], and [[Hsuan Hua]], Maezumi greatly influenced the American Zen landscape. Several Dharma Successors of his—including [[Tetsugen Bernard Glassman]], [[Dennis Merzel]], [[John Daido Loori]], [[Jan Chozen Bays]], [[Gerry Shishin Wick]], [[Joko Beck]], and [[William Nyogen Yeo]]—have gone on to found Zen communities of their own.

Maezumi died unexpectedly while visiting Japan in 1995.

==Biography==
[[File:Baian Hakujun Kuroda.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Maezumi's father, Baian Hakujun Kuroda]]
Maezumi was born in Japan on February 24, 1931 to Yoshiko Kuroda-Maezumi and Baian Hakujun Kuroda, a prominent Sōtō priest, in his father's temple in [[Ōtawara, Tochigi]]. In later years, he took the name Maezumi, his mother's maiden name. He was ordained as a [[Śrāmaṇera|novice monk]] in the Sōtō lineage at age eleven, and in high school began studying Zen under a [[laity|lay]] Rinzai instructor, Koryū Osaka. While studying under Koryu he attended [[Komazawa University]]—receiving degrees in [[Asian literature|oriental literature]] and philosophy. After college he trained at [[Sōji-ji]], and then received [[shihō]] from his father in 1955. In 1956 he was sent to the [[United States]] to serve as a priest at the [[Zenshuji]] in [[Little Tokyo, Los Angeles]], a [[Japanese-American]] neighborhood. He worked part-time at a factory.

The Zenshuji Soto Mission consisted of a Japanese-American congregation that placed little emphasis on [[zazen]]. Maezumi began sitting zazen occasionally with [[Nyogen Senzaki]], in nearby [[Boyle Heights, Los Angeles]] for the next two years. In 1959 Maezumi took classes in [[English language|English]] at [[San Francisco State University]], the year he first met Shunryū Suzuki, occasionally visiting Suzuki's temple, Sokoji, for ceremonies. Early in the 1960s, Maezumi began holding zazen at Zenshuji for Western students, which eventually led to the opening of the [[Zen Center of Los Angeles]] in 1967. That same year he married his first wife, Charlene (they divorced in 1971.)&lt;ref name="preston"&gt;{{cite book| last =Preston| first =David L.| authorlink =| title =The Social Organization of Zen Practice: Constructing Transcultural Reality| publisher =Cambridge University Press| year =1988| location =| pages =31–33| url =| doi =| id = | isbn = 0-521-35000-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ford"&gt;{{cite book| last =Ford| first =James Ishmael| authorlink =James Ishmael Ford| title =Zen Master Who?: A Guide to the People and Stories of Zen| publisher =Wisdom publications| year =2006| location =| pages =162–166| url =| doi =| id = | isbn = 0-86171-509-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.buddhanet.net/e-learning/history/zen-chan.htm Profiles of Zen/Ch'an Buddhists]&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 1967, Maezumi began studying with [[Hakuun Yasutani]], completing kōan study under him and receiving ''inka'' (dharma transmission)&lt;ref name=WhitePlum&gt;[http://www.whiteplum.org/ White Plum Asanga website]&lt;/ref&gt; in 1970. He also received ''inka'' from Koryū Osaka in 1973,&lt;ref name=WhitePlum /&gt; making him a lineage-holder in the Sōtō, Rinzai and Sanbo Kyodan schools.&lt;ref name="preston"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ford"/&gt;&lt;ref name="chadwick"&gt;{{cite web| last =Chadwick| first =David| authorlink =David Chadwick (writer)| title =Memories of Taizan Maezumi| work =| publisher =Cuke.com| date =2004-06-14| url =http://www.cuke.com/dchad/writ/short/dc%20on%20maezumi.html| doi =| accessdate = 2008-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="maguire"&gt;{{cite book| last =Maguire| first =Jack| authorlink =| title =Essential Buddhism: A Complete Guide to Beliefs and Practices| publisher =Simon and Schuster| year =2001| location =| pages =184| url =| doi =| id = | isbn = 0-671-04188-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Koryu Osaka.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Koryu Osaka]]
In 1975 Maezumi married his second wife, Martha Ekyo Maezumi, and later the couple had three children (his daughter [[Kyrie Maezumi]] is an actress).&lt;ref name="jones"/&gt; In 1976, Maezumi founded the non-profit Kuroda Institute for the Study of Buddhism and Human Values, promoting academic scholarship on Buddhist topics. The [[White Plum Asanga]] was also established during this period.&lt;ref name="seager"&gt;{{cite book| last =Seager| first =Richard Hughes| authorlink =| title =Buddhism In America| publisher =Columbia University Press| year =1999| location =| pages =101–102| url =| doi =| id = | isbn = 0-231-10868-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; His senior student [[Tetsugen Bernard Glassman]] opened the Zen Community of New York in 1979 with Maezumi's blessing and encouragement. Another student, [[John Daido Loori]], acquired land in the [[Catskill Mountains]] of [[New York (state)|New York]] and in 1980 established [[Zen Mountain Monastery]] (ZMM) with Maezumi; Loori was installed as Abbot at ZMM in 1989. That following year Maezumi founded a summer retreat for the ZCLA called the [[Yokoji Zen Mountain Center]], which today serves as a year-round residential and non-residential [[Zen]] training center. In 1984 another student, [[Dennis Merzel]], left ZCLA to establish the [[Kanzeon Sangha]], an international network practicing in the Sanbo Kyodan lineage.&lt;ref name="oldmeadow"&gt;{{cite book| last =Oldmeadow| first =Harry| authorlink =| title =Journeys East: 20th Century Western Encounters with Eastern Religious Traditions| publisher =World Wisdom, Inc.| year =2004| location =| url =| doi =| id = | isbn = 0-941532-57-7| pages =298}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nay"&gt;{{cite book| last =Nay| first =David N.| authorlink =| title =Tibetan and Zen Buddhism in Britain: Transplantation, Development and Adaptation| publisher =Routledge| year =2004| location =| pages =31| url =| doi =| id = | isbn = 0-415-29765-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last =Ford| first =James Ishmael| authorlink =James Ishmael Ford| title =Zen Master Who?: A Guide to the People and Stories of Zen| publisher =Wisdom publications| year =2006| location =| pages =169| url =| doi =| id = | isbn = 0-86171-509-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maezumi died on May 15, 1995 while visiting his family in Japan. He had been out drinking; returning home, he took a bath, where he fell asleep and drowned. Not long before dying, he had given ''inka'' (dharma transmission) to Tetsugen Bernard Glassman. He did this to emphasize the Sanbo Kyodan connection of his past into the Dharma transmission of [[White Plum Asanga]], naming Glassman President of the organization in his [[will (law)|will]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last =Ford| first =James Ishmael| authorlink =James Ishmael Ford| title =Zen Master Who?: A Guide to the People and Stories of Zen| publisher =Wisdom publications| year =2006| location =| pages =166| url =| doi =| id = | isbn = 0-86171-509-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Teaching style==
[[File:Taizan Maezumi 2.jpg|thumb|200px|On the way to Poland 1992]]
Due to his training in three [[Japan]]ese lineages, Maezumi employed both Rinzai kōan study and Sōtō shikantaza in his teaching curriculum—an approach developed by his teacher [[Hakuun Yasutani]]. He was known to be especially strict about the posture of his students while sitting [[zazen]]. Maezumi used a range of kōans from different Zen traditions, including the ''[[Blue Cliff Record]]'', ''[[The Gateless Gate]]'', ''[[Transmission of the Lamp]]'', and the ''[[Book of Equanimity]]''.&lt;ref name="kennedy"&gt;{{cite book| last =Kennedy| first =Robert E.| authorlink =| title =Zen Gifts to Christians| publisher =Continuum International Publishing Group| year =2000| location =| pages =11| url =| doi =| id = | isbn = 0-8264-1654-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last =Prebish| first =Charles S.| authorlink =| title =Luminous Passage: The Practice and Study of Buddhism in America| publisher =University of California Press| year =1999| location =| pages =16| url =| doi =| id = | isbn = 0-520-21697-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last =Wick| first =Gerry Shishin| authorlink =Gerry Shishin Wick| title =The Book of Equanimity: Illuminating Classic Zen Koans| publisher =Wisdom Publications| year =2005| location =| pages =1–2| url =| doi =| id = | isbn = 0-86171-387-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to author and Dharma Successor [[Gerry Shishin Wick]], Maezumi was also fond of a particular saying—"appreciate your life." This also is the title of a compiled book of teachings by Maezumi, published by [[Shambhala Publications]]. In it Maezumi says, "I encourage you. Please enjoy this wonderful life together. Appreciate the world just this! There is nothing extra. Genuinely appreciate your life as the most precious treasure and take good care of it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last =Maezumi| first =Taizan| authorlink =| title =Appreciate Your Life: The Essence of Zen Practice| publisher =Shambhala| year =2002| location =| pages =| url =| doi =| id = | isbn = 1-57062-916-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Maezumi publicly admitted he was an [[Alcoholism|alcoholic]] in 1983, and sought treatment at the [[Betty Ford Center]]. This coincided with revelations that he had been having sexual relationships with some of his female followers at the Zen Center of Los Angeles despite being married to his wife, Martha Ekyo Maezumi, "including one of the recipients of his dharma transmission".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last =Wright | first =Dale S. | year =2010 | title =Humanizing the Image of a Zen master: Taizan Maezumi Roshi. In: Zen Masters, edited bySteven Heine and Dale S. Wright | place =Oxford | publisher =Oxford University Press| pages=245}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Kirsten Mitsuyo Maezumi, this "caused the separation of my parents and was the reason my mother left the Zen Center of Los Angeles with my brother and [me] in 1983".&lt;ref name=Kirsten&gt;[http://sweepingzen.com/a-letter-from-kirsten-mitsuyo-maezumi Sweeping Zen (2011), ''A Letter from Kirsten Mitsuyo Maezumi'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Maezumi was forthcoming in admitting his mistakes and did not justify his behaviors.&lt;ref name="chadwick"/&gt; These events caused much turmoil in his school, and many students left as a result. Some members who stayed described themselves as forced to see Maezumi on a more human level, even seeing this period as a breakthrough for them, no longer deluded into thinking a teacher could be beyond imperfection.&lt;ref name="coleman"&gt;{{cite book| last =Coleman| first =James William| authorlink =| title =The New Buddhism: The Western Transformation of an Ancient Tradition| publisher =Oxford University Press| year =2001| location =| pages =178| url =| doi =| id = | isbn = 0-19-515241-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Bays and Tetsugen Bernard Glassman founded their own [[Sangha (Buddhism)|sanghas]] at this time.&lt;ref name="jones"&gt;{{cite web| last =Jones| first =Noa| authorlink =| title =White Plums and Lizard Tails: The Story of Maezumi Roshi and his American Lineage| work =| publisher =Shambhala Sun| url =http://www.shambhalasun.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1492&amp;Itemid=0| format =| doi =| accessdate = 2008-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="chushman"&gt;{{cite web| last =Cushman| first =Anne| authorlink =| title =Under The Lens: An American Zen Community In Crisis| work =| publisher =Tricycle: The Buddhist Review| date =2006-03-29| url =http://www.tricycle.com/issues/from_archive/2000-1.html| doi =| accessdate = 2008-01-25 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080118090604/http://www.tricycle.com/issues/from_archive/2000-1.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; When remembering Maezumi, author [[David Chadwick (writer)|David Chadwick]] had this to say: "I'd say he had an interesting mix of humility and arrogance. Mainly to me he'd seem arrogant at a distance, but close up he'd be right there with me not putting on any airs."&lt;ref name="chadwick"/&gt;

==Influence==
[[File:Maezumi memorial.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Maezumi's ashes]]
Maezumi named twelve Dharma Successors, ordained sixty-eight priests, and administered the Buddhist precepts to over five hundred individuals. Author [[James Ishmael Ford]] says, 
{{quote|His influence on the shape of Western Zen is incalculable." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last =Ford| first =James Ishmael| authorlink =James Ishmael Ford| title =Zen Master Who?: A Guide to the People and Stories of Zen| publisher =Wisdom publications| year =2006| location =| pages =164| url =| doi =| id = | isbn = 0-86171-509-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Jan Chozen Bays]] says, 
{{quote|To me, Maezumi's genius lay in his ability to see the buddhanature and also teaching potential in many different kinds of people. There are some Zen teachers who have no successors or maybe one or two. Maezumi was more the Tibetan style—scatter the seeds widely, some will grow and some will not. We won't know for several generations which of his successors have established lineages that will continue."&lt;ref name="jones"/&gt;}}

His daughter Kirsten Mitsuyo Maezumi writes:
{{quote|He was not a good father, or a good husband to my mother, but he was an outstanding teacher with a love for the dharma and a vision of liberation that took precedence in all he did.&lt;br /&gt;
As an adult, in my travels and own seeking, I hear testimonials to his awakened Buddha nature and hear and see the proof of it in the difference it has made for so many other gifted beings to step into their place as teachers and facilitators of peace and consciousness.&lt;br /&gt;
It is a lineage spanning continents and decades and I am very proud of him. It is the best consolation I can have; seeing and hearing his students teach.&lt;ref name=Kirsten /&gt;}}

The '''TriBalance Yoga''' Method is a form of hot yoga that integrates aspects of several styles, including [[Rāja yoga|Ashtanga Yoga]], [[Iyengar Yoga]], [[Yin yoga]], and therapeutic yoga. The style emphasizes mind-body-spirit union and action meditation.

One concept behind the TriBalance Method is self-discipline and modernization of an ancient tradition. One aspect of early yoga was as a martial art, which warriors would practice to be strong and limber for battles. Another is [[Tapas (Sanskrit)|Tapas]], which is a [[Sanskrit]] word that translates literally to heat. In yogic discipline it means ecstasy, burning out negativity on the journey to enlightenment. It is an egalitarian method of yoga emphasizing modifications of poses and use of props, designed to help students gradually grow strong enough to perform the full posture on their own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tribalanceyoga.wordpress.com |title=Tribalanceyoga |publisher=Tribalanceyoga.wordpress.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; It emphasizes mindfulness and action-meditation. From the moment they enter the room until the moment they leave, students are asked to observe silence between classes to quiet their minds. Lastly, the TriBalance Method emphasizes helping students to uncover their practice, rather than teaching it to them.

== Differences from Bikram ==
Though TriBalance yoga is [[hot yoga]], it differs from Bikram in many ways.

*In the TriBalance classes, lights are dim, which is to remove self-consciousness and make the process more internal for students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tribalance.com |title=Schaumburg Yoga Studio : Welcome to Tri Balance Yoga |publisher=Tribalance.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The TriBalance classes can vary from class to class and teacher to teacher, rather than adhering to a set 26-pose sequence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bikramyoga.com/BikramYoga/TwentySixPostures.php |title=Bikram Yoga 26 Postures |publisher=Bikramyoga.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*TriBalance involves more poses to strengthen the core and upper body and stretch the hips and back, particularly to recover from and prevent spinal injury and discomfort. A TriBalance Hot Yoga class integrates standing, balance, core and seated poses.
*Bikram classes do not use props, blocks, or manual adjustments. TriBalance classes teach to the beginner level but use hands-on adjustments to correct for injury prevention or advance students.
*Most Bikram poses are done twice in a row; once for 60 seconds and again for 30. Tribalance poses are generally held once and for longer to stimulate more fascia release. This ties into the Yin Yoga influence; Yin referring to the deep tissues as opposed to the more superficial Yang (outer muscle) tissues &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Grilley |first=Paul |url=http://www.yogajournal.com/practice/580 |title=Yoga Asana Columns - Yin Yoga |publisher=Yoga Journal |date= |accessdate=2012-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*TriBalance discourages pregnant women from practicing heated yoga;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tribalance.com |title=Schaumburg Yoga Studio : Welcome to Tri Balance Yoga |publisher=Tribalance.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bikram encourages it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bikramyoga.com/BikramYoga/PregnancyYoga.php |title=Testimonials - Bikram Yoga During Pregnancy, Bikram Yoga |publisher=Bikramyoga.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Corey Kelly and Shawnda Falvo opened TriBalance Yoga in 2007. Kelly had worked as a personal trainer for 10 years, as well as training in martial arts, before discovering yoga. He then had an intensive, year-long study with a live-in yoga instructor Shiva Kumar Madayya, the world-class yoga champion who won many competitions in India. There he was first introduced to Iyengar and therapuetic yoga.

Kelly trained in Bikram, but wasn't totally satisfied with the one sequence and monologue. He was inspired by class and conversations with Mac McHugh at Niyama Yoga,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.niyamayoga.com/index.html |title=Wilmette, IL |publisher=Niyama Yoga |date= |accessdate=2012-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gabriel Halpern from Yoga Circle,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yogacircle.com |title=Celebrating 26 years! |publisher=Yoga Circle |date= |accessdate=2012-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Paul Grilley of [[Yin yoga]]. He determined that heat is a benefit but there could be many styles of hot yoga. He gradually created the TriBalance Method, integrating different aspects of his yoga practices with his background as a personal trainer and experience with sports injuries. He and his partner Shawnda run the first TriBalance studio in Schaumburg, IL.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3218">Benj Hellie's '''vertiginous question''' is as follows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hellie|first=Benj|title=Against egalitarianism|journal=Analysis|year=2013|volume=73|issue=2|pages=304–320|doi=10.1093/analys/ans101}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of all the subjects of experience out there, why is '''this''' one—the one corresponding to the human being referred to as Benj Hellie—the one whose experiences are ''live''? (The reader is supposed to substitute his/her own case for Hellie's.)

A simple response to this question is that it reduces to "Why are Hellie's experiences live from Hellie's perspective," which is trivial to answer. However, Hellie argues, through a parable, that this response leaves something out. The parable describes two situations, one reflecting a broad global ''constellation'' view of the world and everyone's phenomenal features, and one describing an ''embedded'' view from the perspective of a single subject. The former seems to align better with the simple response above, but the latter seems a better description of consciousness.

[[David Chalmers]] has written a response to Hellie, but he did not address the question itself.&lt;ref name="chalmers"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chalmers|first=David|title=The Contents of Consciousness: Reply to Hellie, Peacocke and Siegel|journal=Analysis|date=2013|volume=73|issue=2|pages=345–368|url=http://consc.net/papers/contents.pdf|doi=10.1093/analys/ant024}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hellie's argument is also closely related to [[Caspar John Hare|Caspar Hare]]'s theories of [[egocentric presentism]] and [[perspectival realism]], of which several other philosophers have written reviews.&lt;ref name="mcdaniels"&gt;{{cite journal|last=McDaniel|first=Kris|title=''On Myself, and Other, Less Important Subjects'' by Hare, Caspar - Review by: Kris McDaniel|journal=Ethics|date=January 2012|volume=122|issue=2|pages=403–410|url=http://krmcdani.mysite.syr.edu/whymcxmattersmost.pdf|doi=10.1086/663578}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="markosian"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Markosian|first=Ned|title=Are You Special?

{{Wikisource|Hyakujo's Fox}}
The '''wild fox kōan''', also known as "'''Pai-chang 's fox'''" and "'''Hyakujō and a Fox'''," is an influential [[kōan]] story in the [[Zen]] tradition dating back as early as 1036, when it appeared in the Chinese biographical history ''T'ien-sheng kuang-teng lu''. It was also in [[Gateless gate|''The Gateless Gate'']] lang-ja {{nihongo||無門関|Mumonkan}}, a 13th-century collection of 48 kōans compiled by the Chinese monk [[Wumen]], as case 2.

==Overview==
The koan tells the story of a monk who, after denying that an enlightened person falls into cause and effect, was turned into a wild fox for five hundred lifetimes. He appears to Zen Master [[Baizhang]] ([[Wade-Giles]]: ''Pai-chang''; Japanese: ''Hyakujō'') and demands a "turning word," a phrase intended to prompt one to realization, to be freed from his animal form. 

After Baizhang tells him not to ignore cause and effect, the monk confirms that he has been released from his wild fox body and asks to be given a monk's funeral rites. Later, when Baizhang's disciple [[Huangbo Xiyun|Huangbo]] (Wade-Giles: ''Huang-po''; Japanese: ''Ōbaku'') asks what would have happened had the monk not denied cause and effect, Baizhang tells Huangbo to come close so he can answer him. Huangbo steps forward and slaps Baizhang, ostensibly in the awareness that Baizhang had intended to strike him. Baizhang laughs approvingly and compares Huangbo to the Indian monk and Zen patriarch [[Bodhidharma]].

==The kōan==

===Main case===
Tanahashi gives the following rendering of the koan:{{sfn|Tanahashi|1999|p=263-264}}
{{quote|Every time Baizhang, Zen Master Dahui, gave a dharma talk, a certain old man would come to listen. He usually left after the talk, but one day he remained. Baizhang asked, "Who is there?"

The man said, "I am not actually a human being. I lived and taught on this mountain at the time of Kashyapa Buddha. One day a student asked me, 'Does a person who practices with great devotion still fall into cause and effect?' I said to him, 'No, such a person doesn't.' Because I said this I was reborn as a wild fox for five hundred lifetimes. Reverend master, please say a turning word for me and free me from this wild fox body." Then he asked Baizhang, "Does a person who practices with great devotion still fall into cause and effect?"

Baizhang said, "Don't ignore cause and effect."

Immediately the man had great realization. Bowing, he said, "I am now liberated from the body of a wild fox. I will stay in the mountain behind the monastery. Master, could you perform the usual services for a deceased monk for me?"

Baizhang asked the head of the monks' hall to inform the assembly that funeral services for a monk would be held after the midday meal. The monks asked one another, "What's going on? Everyone is well; there is no one sick in the Nirvana Hall." After their meal, Baizhang led the assembly to a large rock behind the monastery and showed them a dead fox at the rock's base. Following the customary procedure, they cremated the body.

That evening during his lecture in the dharma hall Baizhang talked about what had happened that day. Huangbo asked him, "A teacher of old gave a wrong answer and became a wild fox for five hundred lifetimes. What if he hadn't given a wrong answer?"

Baizhang said, "Come closer and I will tell you." Huangbo went closer and slapped Baizhang's face. Laughing, Baizhang clapped his hands and said, "I thought it was only barbarians who had unusual beards. But you too have an unusual beard!"{{sfn|Tanahashi|1999|p=263-264}}{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Baizhang's turning word is rendered differently in various translations, as "obscure," "ignore," and "evade."{{sfn|Shibayama|1974}}{{sfn|Heine|1999}}&lt;ref&gt;Robert Aitken ed., The Gateless Barrier: The Wu-Men Kuan (Mumonkan) (San Francisco: North Point Press, 1990).&lt;/ref&gt;}}}}

===Wumen's commentary and poem===
Shibayama gives the following translation of Wumen's commentary and verse:
{{quote|"Not falling into causation." Why was he turned into a fox? "Not ignoring causation." Why was he released from the fox body? If you have an eye to see through this, then you will know that the former head of the monastery did enjoy his five hundred happy blessed lives as a fox.{{sfn|Shibayama|1974|p=33}}}}

{{quote|Not falling, not ignoring:&lt;br&gt;
Odd and even are on one die.&lt;br&gt;
Not ignoring, not falling:&lt;br&gt;
Hundreds and thousands of regrets!{{sfn|Shibayama|1974|p=33}}}}

==Interpretation==
The meaning of the kōan has been the object of intense debate and scrutiny within Zen due to its complexity and multi-layered themes. It was rated by Zen Master [[Hakuin]] (1686–1769) as a ''nantō'' kōan, one that is "difficult to pass through" but has the ability to facilitate "postenlightenment cultivation" or "realization beyond realization" (''shōtaichōyō'').&lt;ref name=note0 &gt;Steven Heine, ''Shifting Shape, Shaping Text: Philosophy and Folklore in the Fox Kōan'' (Honolulu: University of Hawai'i Press, 1999), 41.&lt;/ref&gt; Important themes include causality ([[karma in Buddhism]]), the power of language, reincarnation, and the folklore elements involved in the insertion of the fox into the tale.

Traditionally, interpretations since the time of the ''Mumonkan'' have stressed the nonduality of the two understandings of causality expressed within the case. [[Dogen|Dōgen]], regarded by Sōtō adherents as the founder of their practice, recast the kōan in the later part of his life as an affirmation of the fundamental importance of acknowledging cause and effect. The significance of this debate goes to fundamental issues in Buddhist thought, especially the meaning of [[Bodhi|enlightenment]] with respect to cause and effect.

===Dōgen's interpretation===
Dōgen articulated a doctrine called ''[[Genjōkōan]]'' which stressed “full participation in and through all phenomena” as the kōan bears on the immediate here-and-now.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Heine, ''Dōgen and the Kōan Tradition: A Tale of Two Shōbōgenzō Texts'' (Albany: State University of New York Press, 1994), 125.&lt;/ref&gt; In this way, the stereotypical account of Dōgen as wholly in opposition to the use of kōans is in error. Dōgen drew upon kōans as an arbiter of philosophical authority and credence to grant his own ideas, often rooted in practical considerations, authenticity and importance.

Dōgen's views on the wild-fox kōan underwent a transformation from the conventional interpretation to an embrace of causality, as can be seen in two writings contained in the ''[[Shōbōgenzō]]'', a compilation of [[Fascicle (book)|fascicle]]s written between the years 1231 and 1253. In contrast to his appropriation of other significant kōans, Dōgen initially supported the conventional understanding of the wild-fox kōan and only later recanted his view. The "Daishugyō" fascicle, written in 1244 (less than a year after Dōgen left the capital [[Kyoto]] to build a monastery in [[Echizen, Fukui|Echizen]]), conforms to the conventional view of the nonduality of the two notions of causality:

{{quote|Because causality necessarily means full cause (''ennin'') and complete effect (''manga''), there is no reason for a discussion concerning "falling into" or "not falling into," "obscuring" or "not obscuring" [causality]....Although "not obscuring causality" released the wild fox body in the current age of Buddha Sakyamuni, it may not have been effective in the age of Buddha Kasyapa.&lt;ref&gt;Heine, ''Shifting Shape, Shaping Text: Philosophy and Folklore in the Fox Kōan'', 19.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This view, which is in accordance with Wumen's position, notes the contingency of causality and non-causality and the need to transcend a limited perspective of cause and effect. However, Dōgen turns against this interpretation later in his life and stakes out a position in opposition to the conventional reading.

The change in emphasis in the later part of Dōgen’s life came at a point when he had separated himself from secular politics and had determined the need to create a monastic ideal that would have appeal among lay people. This is a position endorsed by the Monastic View of Dōgen’s late career, which holds that by the late 1240s Dōgen had become "a genuinely innovative administrator and orchestrator of monastic ritualism" who crafted his teachings and rituals with a variety of audiences in mind, including lay people and monks.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Heine, ''Did Dōgen Go to China?: What He Wrote and When He Wrote It'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2006), 216.&lt;/ref&gt; An important implication of the fact that Dōgen sought to cultivate a lay audience is that his emphasis on supernatural events at his monastery [[Eiheiji]], which appears in his writings starting in the late 1240s and lasts until his death, was aimed at attracting lay followers. Dōgen's changing interpretation of the wild-fox kōan, which has clear supernatural themes, can be seen in this light.

Indeed, by 1248, when Dōgen returned to Eiheiji from his Kamakura trip (in the time of the [[Kamakura shogunate]]), during which he refused an offer to head a temple in the city, his newfound view on causality had formed. In a formal talk he gave to his monks immediately upon his arrival, Dōgen was explicit in endorsing the literal interpretation of the kōan that not ignoring causality was an imperative for Buddhists:
{{quote|Some of you may think that crossing countless mountains and rivers to teach lay students is giving priority to lay people over monks. Others may wonder if I taught them dharma that has never been expounded and has never been heard. However, there is no dharma that has never been expounded and has never been heard. I just expounded this dharma to guide people: Those who practice wholesome actions rise and those who practice unwholesome actions fall. You practice cause and harvest the effect….Thus I try to clarify, speak, identify with, and practice this teaching of cause and effect. Do you all understand it?{{sfn|Tanahashi|1999|p=257}}}}

Dōgen acknowledges the perception among the Eiheiji monks that there has been a shift in his emphasis, though he seems to deny that there has been a substantive change. He also roots his teaching in tradition with the statement “there is no dharma that has never been expounded,” suggesting that he is drawing upon precedent and clarifying that his new teaching is meant only “to guide people.” Dōgen thus justifies the new teaching to his monks as a historically grounded and practical doctrine, although he recognizes the suddenness which he has introduced his ideas, apologizing to the assembly for “speak[ing] of cause and effect with no reason” and finishing his talk with a nostalgic poem.&lt;ref&gt;Heine, ''Dōgen and the Kōan Tradition: A Tale of Two Shōbōgenzō Texts'', 128.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dōgen revisits the wild-fox kōan in “Jinshin inga,” a 1250s rewriting of the earlier “Daishugyō” fascicle, to ground his ideas in precedent and explain them in detail. He elaborates upon the significance of cause and effect, setting the stage for criticism of other thinkers and schools of thought. By suggesting that there is a distinction between existing in causality and a state in which causality is no longer in force, Dōgen's newfound view runs, conventional interpretations thus fall victim to "a dualistic contrast between the pure and impure, flux and serenity, and freedom from and subjection to causation."{{sfn|Tanahashi|1999|p=257}} He explains:
{{quote|Those who say "one does not fall into cause and effect" deny causation, thereby falling into the lower realms. Those who say "one cannot ignore cause and effect" clearly identify with cause and effect. When people hear about identifying with cause and effect, they are freed from the lower realms. Do not doubt this. Many of our contemporaries who consider themselves students of Zen deny causation. How do we know? They confuse "not ignoring" with "not falling into." Thus we know they deny cause and effect.&lt;ref&gt;Heine, ''Dōgen and the Kōan Tradition: A Tale of Two Shōbōgenzō Texts'', 264.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This is a clear repudiation of the earlier interpretation of the wild-fox kōan, specifically identifying it as illegitimate and inauthentic. In so doing, Dōgen clarifies his own position and distinguishes himself from interpretations of the kōan that stress the philosophical content of the story over the supernatural, folklore elements. Dōgen is especially clear to distinguish himself in opposition to the prevailing understanding of causality as he sees it in China, who allege that the monk had achieved "a limited view of enlightenment" due to his ability to remember past lives.&lt;ref&gt;Heine, ''Dōgen and the Kōan Tradition: A Tale of Two Shōbōgenzō Texts'', 266.&lt;/ref&gt; Dōgen takes this opportunity to reaffirm the all-encompassing power of cause and effect and the existence of the supernatural, as the fox in the kōan demonstrates. He notes that those who claim the monk "did not become a fox because of past actions" are wrong: while some foxes are born with the ability to remember their past lives, "such a capacity may be the result of unwholesome action and not necessarily a seed of enlightenment." In other words, Dōgen confirms the deeply embedded Asian folklore stereotype that “there is something occultly nasty about an oriental fox," as Robert Aitken notes.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Aitken ed., The Gateless Barrier: The Wu-Men Kuan (Mumonkan) (San Francisco: North Point Press, 1990), 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to Wumen’s commentary that the monk “did enjoy his five hundred blessed lives as a fox,” Dōgen argues that the fox transformation quite simply represents the undesirable result of the monk’s actions and thus demonstrates the power of karmic causality. He also speculates about the fate of the monk and which realm he is reincarnated into, noting that "free from a wild fox’s body, it must be either the realm of devas or humans."{{sfn|Tanahashi|1999|p=265}} In his literal interpretation of the kōan, Dōgen accepts without doubt the supernatural elements in the story: the transformation into a wild fox, the monk’s subsequent ability to assume the form of a man when speaking to Baizhang, and his pledge to exist in the mountain. Having established the link between his embrace of causality and his cultivation of a lay people audience, Dōgen allows for the plausibility of supernatural occurrences within his doctrine of karmic causality.{{sfn|Tanahashi|1999|p=267}}

===Wumen's verse===
{{quote|Not falling, not ignoring:&lt;br&gt;
Odd and even are on one die.&lt;br&gt;
Not ignoring, not falling:&lt;br&gt;
Hundreds and thousands of regrets!{{sfn|Shibayama|1974|p=33}}}}

Steven Heine notes that such a reading, 
{{quote|...emphasizes the relativity and ultimate inseparability of the conflicting views of causality (or not obscuring cause-and-effect) and noncausality (or not falling into cause-and-effect).{{sfn|Heine|1999|p=18}}}} 

Either notion, in other words, can lead to liberation or to the perpetuation of suffering. Wumen's poem suggests that neither view of causality has an absolute monopoly on the truth. This view was quickly taken up by dozens of other commentaries and became the mainstream interpretation, creating a tradition in various schools of understanding the kōan in this way.

An alternative translation of Wumen's Ode:
{{quote|Not falling, not darkening:&lt;br&gt;
Two colors, one game.&lt;br&gt;
Not darkening, not falling:&lt;br&gt;
One thousand mistakes, ten thousand mistakes.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}}}

"Two colors, one game" refers literally to the "die" used in the Chinese game that had colors instead of numbered dots as in the die known to Europeans. The image refers to the Zen view that there is an underlying oneness to the two colors of falling or not falling into cause and effect. As [[Hakuin]] wrote in his Ode To Sitting Meditation (坐禅和讃, ''Zazen Wasan'') when one turns the light around and awakens to one's self-nature, "then opens the gate of the oneness of cause and effect" (因果一如の門ひらけ, Inga ichi nyo no mon hirake). 

The point of the koan is that for the ordinary person the two conflicting views of causality are between falling into cause and effect or not falling into cause and effect, because they dream of being free from cause and effect as being separate from cause and effect. But when a person awakens to their true nature he/she sees the oneness of cause and effect and therefore that person does not "darken", "obscure", or "ignore" (昧, ''mei4'') the functioning of cause and effect by imagining cause and effect are two separate things, that cause and effect is separate from one's Buddha nature. Thus awakened persons neither "fall into" nor do they "not fall into" cause and effect, because they are one with cause and effect. And because they are one with cause and effect, they do not darken or ignore cause and effect.

Yet another and very different translation to the above two takes things more literally:
{{quote|Controlled or not controlled?&lt;br&gt;
The same die shows two faces.&lt;br&gt;
Not controlled or controlled,&lt;br&gt;
Both are a grievous error.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}}}

Štúr was an [[Community organizing|organizer]] of the [[Slovakia|Slovak]] volunteer [[Political campaign|campaigns]] during the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1848]]. He was also a politician, [[Slovak poetry|poet]], journalist, publisher, teacher, philosopher, [[linguist]] and member of the Hungarian Parliament.

== Background ==
{{Off-topic|date=August 2011}}
{{Essay-like|date=August 2011}}

=== Language dispute ===
At the turn of the 18th and 19th centuries, Slovaks were divided concerning the literary language to be used:
* Catholics continued to use the standard{{Clarify|date=June 2009}} that had developed in Slovak writing by 1610. [[Anton Bernolák]]'s language codified in the 1780s was an attempt to blend that standard with the west-Slovakian idiom of the university town of [[Trnava]] (Nagyszombat), but most authors respected Bernolák's standard only to the degree that it did not diverge from the traditional written standard;
* Most [[Lutheran]]s diverged from that standard in the late 17th – early 18th century and began to adhere strictly to the archaic language of the [[Moravian Church|Moravian]] [[Bible of Kralice]], whose imitation became a matter of faith with them during their persecution by the [[Habsburgs]].

This situation did not change until the 1840s, when Ľudovít Štúr became the chief figure of the Slovak national movement.

At the same time, modern nations started to develop in Europe and in the Kingdom of Hungary. The [[Hungarian people|Hungarians]] favoured the idea of a centralized state, although the Magyar population was only some 40% of the population of the Hungarian Kingdom in the 1780s.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} This was unacceptable to other national groups, including the Slovaks, and they expressed their disapproval.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}

=== Slovak language ===
In the 1830s, a new [[generation]] of [[Slovaks]] began to make themselves heard. They had grown up under the influence of the national movement at the prestigious Lutheran ''[[Lyceum|Lýceum]]'' (preparatory high school and college) in [[Bratislava]], where the [[Czech Republic|Czech]]-Slav Society (also called the "Society for the Czechoslovak Language and Literature") had been founded in 1829. Initially, the society operated in accordance with the ideas of [[Ján Kollár]], a Protestant minister, poet, and academic, supporter of [[Czechoslovakian|Czech-Slovak]] unity, and of the users of the language of [[Bible of Kralice]]. In the latter part of the decade, when Ľudovít Štúr came to the fore, its activities intensified. The most prominent representatives of the new generation were, along with Ľudovít Štúr, [[Jozef Miloslav Hurban]] (1817–1888) and [[Michal Miloslav Hodža]] (1811–1870).

Ľudovít Štúr expressed his philosophy in one sentence: "My country is my being, and every hour of my life shall be devoted to it". Štúr, a [[Lutheran]], was aware of the fact that [[Czech language|Czech]], the [[language]] of educated Lutherans, was not enough to carry out a national campaign, and that [[Slovaks]], if they were ever to become autonomous and be an effective force against [[Magyarization]], needed a [[language]] they could call their [[own]]. The central [[Slovak language|Slovak]] [[dialect]] was chosen as the basis of a [[literary language]]. Štúr's [[codification (linguistics)|codification]] work was disapproved of by [[Ján Kollár]] and the Czechs, who saw it as an act of Slovak withdrawal from the idea of a common [[Czechoslovakia|Czecho-Slovak]] nation and a weakening of solidarity. But the majority of Slovak scholars, including the Catholics (using Bernolák's codification until then), welcomed the notion of [[codification (linguistics)|codification]]. The [[standard language]] thus became an important political tool.

=== March 1848 – August 1849 ===
[[Image:Ludovit Stur monument Levoca.jpg|thumb|left|Ľudovít Štúr Monument, [[Levoča]]]]
[[File:Stur - Zofin, Praha.jpg|right|thumb|Ľudovít Štúr monument at Žofín in Prague]]
Štúr's notions (an autonomous [[Slovakia|Slovak]] area, a Slovak [[Diet (assembly)]], Slovak schools, etc.) came to fruition simultaneously with the 1848 Revolution in Hungary, which dealt with the liberation of peasants from [[serfdom]] and other national and ethnic issues. Hungarian revolutionaries called for Hungary’s [[separatism|separation]] from [[Vienna]], but at the same time, they wanted to see Hungary as one nation with one language and one educational system. But the desires of the [[Magyars]] for a centralized Hungarian state ran [[contrary (logic)|contrary]] to the wishes of other national groups, including the [[Slovaks]]. Slovak and Hungarian revolutionary claims ran counter to each other.

In the spring of 1848, Slovak leaders spread their ideas throughout [[Upper Hungary]]. Slovak nationalists, mainly in the progressive western and central [[Upper Hungary]], joined them. In May 1848, a huge public meeting took place in [[Liptovský Mikuláš|Liptovský Svätý Mikuláš]] (Liptószentmiklós; present [[Liptovský Mikuláš]]), where a pan-Slovak program, known as the "Requirements of the Slovak Nation" was proclaimed and accepted. Ethnic Slovaks sought to back this revolutionary [[manifesto]] by force of arms. The provisional Hungarian [[revolutionary]] government was not willing to accept the [[Requirements]] of the [[Slovakia|Slovak]] Nation and the situation developed into open hostility between Hungarian and Slovak revolutionaries.

In September 1848, the [[Slovak National Council (1848-1849)|Slovak National Council]] was established in [[Vienna]] and it forthwith proclaimed the [[secession]] of the Slovak territory from Hungary. The so-called September campaign (consisting of 6000 volunteers) took place in western [[Upper Hungary]]. Slovak demands remained unfulfilled. Between November 1848 and April 1849, the armed Slovaks helped the Habsburg king – along with imperial troops in present-day Hungary – to defeat Hungarians and their revolutionary government on present-day Slovak territory (the so-called Winter Campaign or Volunteer Campaigns). In March 1849, [[Slovaks]] even temporarily managed to start to [[administer]] [[Slovakia]] themselves and they sent a petition (the March Petition) to the emperor. However, in the summer of 1849, the Russians helped the Habsburg monarchy defeat the revolutionary Hungarians, and in November, when the Slovaks were not needed anymore, the Slovak corps was dissolved in Vienna. Then in December 1851, Emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph]] abolished the last vestiges of [[constitutionalism]] and began to rule as an absolute emperor. Francis Joseph continued his centralization policies. This came to be known as the period of [[neo-absolutism]]. Certain Slovak demands were met, however. In the northern counties of the Kingdom of Hungary, the Slovak language was allowed for official communication and was introduced in lower schools (see in [[:sk:Bachovský absolutizmus#Charakteristika]] resp. [[:sk:Bachove Slovenské noviny]]). But in higher courts, the Slovaks faced the same [[Germanization]] as all the other ethnicities. [[Ján Kollár]], who became a professor at [[Vienna University]], obtained permission to print [[Slovakia|Slovak]] newspapers and was appointed a court adviser.

== Biography ==

=== Early life ===
Ľudovít Štúr was born on 29 October 1815 in [[Uhrovec]], in the [[Austrian Empire]] (in the same house where [[Alexander Dubček]] was later born) as the second child of Samuel and Anna Štúr. He was baptized in the [[Evangelical Lutheran]] church in [[Uhrovec]]. He acquired his basic education, including the study of [[Latin language|Latin]], from his father Samuel, who was a teacher. From 1827–1829, he studied in [[Győr]] where he attended a lower [[grammar school]]. There, he improved his knowledge of history, and the German [[Greek language|Greek]] and Hungarian languages. These studies inspired his admiration of [[Pavel Jozef Šafárik]], Ján Kollár and [[Jiří Dobrovsky]]. In 1829, he decided to change schools.

From 1829 to 1836, Ľudovít Štúr studied at the prestigious Lutheran ''Lýceum'' (preparatory high school and college) in Pressburg and became a member of the Czech-Slav Society, which stimulated his interest in all Slav nations. At the Lýceum was a famous professor, [[Juraj Palkovič]], in the Department of the [[Czechoslovak]] Language and Ancient Literature, the only such department at a Protestant school of higher education in 19th century Hungary.

In 1831, Ľudovít Štúr wrote his first poems. From January to September 1834, he temporarily interrupted his studies due to a lack of finances, and returned to [[Uhrovec|Zayugróc]], where he worked as a scribe for Count Károly Zay. Later that year, he resumed his studies, was active in the historical and [[literary]] circle of the Czech-Slav Society, was responsible for correspondence with members of the Society, gave private lessons in the house of a merchant in [[Pressburg]] (today: Bratislava), taught younger students at the Lýceum, and established contacts with important foreign and Czech scholars. On 17 December 1834, he was elected secretary of the Czech-Slav Society at the Lýceum.

=== Slovak national movement ===
In May 1835, Ľudovít Štúr persuaded Jozef Hurban to become involved in the Slovak national movement. Also that year, he was co-editor of the ''Plody'' ("Fruits") almanac, a compilation of the best works of the members of the Czech-Slav Society, including poems of Štúr's. He became vice-president of the Czech-Slav Society, teaching older students at the Lýceum the history of the Slavs and their literatures.

In 1836, Štúr wrote a letter to Czech historian [[František Palacký]], in which he stated that the Czech language used by the Protestants in [[Upper Hungary]] had become incomprehensible for ordinary Slovaks, and proposed the creation of a unified [[Czechoslovak language]], provided that the Czechs would be willing to use some Slovak words – just like Slovaks would officially accept some Czech words. But the Czechs were unwilling to accept this, and so Štúr and his friends decided to introduce a completely new Slovak language standard instead.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} On 24 April 1836, a trip to [[Devín Castle]] (Dévény, now part of [[Bratislava]]) by the members of the Slovak national movement took place, led by Štúr as the vice-president of the [[Czech-Slav Society]]. The beginning of his group's extensive efforts on behalf of national awareness are linked to this visit to the ruins of Devín Castle, woven together with legends and reminders of [[Great Moravia]]. The members of the Czech-Slav Society swore here to be true to the national cause, deciding to travel around [[Upper Hungary]] to drum up support for their ideas. At the castle, they also adopted additional Slavic names (e.g., Jozef Hurban became Jozef Miloslav Hurban, etc.).

From 1836 to 1838, as deputy (non-stipendiary assistant) for Professor Palkovič, Chair of the Czechoslovak Language and Literature Department at the Lýceum where he was previously a student, he taught History of Slavic Literature. He continued to write poetry and under his leadership, the number of members of the Czech-Slav Society continuously increased. In this year, a poem of Štúr's was published in printed form for the first time: ''Óda na Hronku'' ("An ode to Hronka"). In April 1837, the Czech-Slav Society was banned due to a commotion between students at the Lýceum. One week later, Štúr founded the Institute of the Czechoslovak Language and Literature, within which the activities of the Czech-Slav Society continued. In that year, he continued to write articles for newspapers and journals, including ''Tatranka'', ''Hronka'', ''Květy'' (Czech), ''Časopis českého musea'', ''Danica'' ([[Croatia]]n) and ''Tygodnik literacki'' ([[Poland|Polish]]).

=== Travels in Germany and early political works ===
From 1838 to 1840, he attended the (Protestant) University of [[Halle, Saxony-Anhalt|Halle]] in Germany, where he studied linguistics, history, and philosophy. He was influenced by the works of the German philosophers [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] and [[Johann Gottfried Herder]]. Also during this period, his poetic cycle ''Dumky večerní'' ("Evening Thoughts", written in Czech) was published in the Czech journal ''Květy''. He left Pressburg for Halle in September 1838. On his way to Halle, he spent more than a month in [[Prague]], in the company of Czech patriots. In the spring of 1839, Štúr made a long journey to the Upper and Lower [[Lusatia]] in Germany (inhabited by Slavs) and got in touch with the Slavs there. He wrote the short travelogue ''Cesta do Lužic vykonaná na jar 1839'' ("A journey to Lusatia made in the spring of 1839"), written in Czech and published in the Czech journal ''Časopis českého musea''.

In 1840, he returned to Bratislava via Prague and [[Hradec Králové]] (Königgrätz), where he spent some time in the house of publisher [[Jan Pospíšil]]. From October, he was once again working as deputy for Professor Palkovič at the Department of the Czecho-Slav Language and Literature at the Evangelical Lutheran Lýceum, teaching courses of grammar and Slav history, and continuing his activities at the Institute of the Czechoslovak Language.

During 1841–1844, Štúr was co-editor of Palkovič's literary magazine, ''Tatranka''. In 1841, he started activities aimed at publishing a Slovak political newspaper. He wrote defenses and [[polemic]] texts, as well as his ''Starý a nový věk Slovákov'' ("The old and the new age of the Slovaks"), written in Old Czech and published in 1935 (not in Slovak until 1994). On 16 August 1841, Štúr and his friends ascended [[Kriváň (peak)|Kriváň]] (a symbolic mountain in Slovak culture), an event that is now commemorated by annual excursions to its summit. In 1842, he initiated the first ''Slovenský prestolný prosbopis'', a Slovak petition to the Royal Court in Vienna requiring the government to stop national persecutions by the Hungarians in [[Upper Hungary]]. His application for a licence to publish a newspaper was turned down in the same year.

=== Codification of Slovak ===
On 2 February 1843, in Pressburg, Štúr and his friends decided to create a new Slovak language standard (later used as a basis for contemporary literary Slovak), based on central Slovak dialects – a common language that would unify all Slovaks speaking many different dialects. From 26 to 29 June 1843, a special committee met to investigate the Institute of Czechoslovak Language at the Lýceum, also interrogating Štúr. Štúr was forced to leave his position at the Institute. Twenty-two students also left the institution in support of Štúr and transferred their studies to the [[Evangelical]] Lýceum in [[Levoča]] (Lőcse).

In July 1843, his defense, ''Die Beschwerden und Klagen der Slaven in Ungarn über die gesetzwidrigen Übergriffe der Magyaren'' ("The complaints and grievances of the Slavs in Hungary about the illegal malfeasances of the Hungarians"), which editorial offices throughout 19th century Hungary had refused to publish, was published in [[Leipzig]], Germany. From 11 to 16 July 1843, at the parish house of [[Hurban|J. M. Hurban]] in [[Hlboké]], the leaders of the Slovak national movement – Štúr, J. M. Hurban, and M.M. Hodža – agreed on how to codify the new [[Slovak language|Slovak]] language standard and how to introduce it to the public. On 17 July 1843, they visited [[Ján Hollý]], an important writer and representative of the older [[Anton Bernolák|Bernolák]] [[Slovak language]] standard, in [[Dobrá Voda, Trnava District|Dobrá Voda]] and informed him about their plans. On 11 October 1843, although the committee did not find anything illegal about Štúr's activities, Štúr was ordered to stop lecturing and was removed from the function of [[deputy (legislator)|deputy]] for [[Juraj Palkovič|Prof. Palkovič]]. However, Štúr continued to give lectures. On 31 December 1843, he was definitively deprived of the function of deputy for Prof. Palkovič. As a result, in March 1844, 22 students left Pressburg in protest; 13 of them went to study at the [[Evangelical]] [[Lýceum]] in the town of [[Levoča]]. One of the supporting students was [[Janko Matuška]], who took the opportunity to write a hymn, "Nad Tatrou sa blýska", which later became the official [[anthem]] of the [[Slovak Republic]].

From 1843 to 1847, Štúr worked as a private linguist. In 1844, he wrote ''Nárečja slovenskuo alebo potreba písaňja v tomto nárečí'' ("The Slovak dialect or, the necessity of writing in this dialect"). On 19 May 1844, a second ''Slovenský prestolný prosbopis'' was sent to Vienna, but had little influence. But in 1844, other Slovak authors (often Štúr’s students) started to use the new Slovak language standard. On 27 August, he participated in the founding convention of the Slovak association Tatrín, the first nationwide association.

On 1 August 1845, the first issue of ''Slovenskje národňje novini'' ("Slovak National Newspaper", published until 9 June 1848) was published. One week later, its literary supplement, ''Orol Tatranský'' ("The Tatra Eagle", published until 6 June 1848) was also published. In this newspaper, written in the new Slovak language, he gradually shaped a Slovak political program. He based this on the precept that the Slovaks were one nation, and that they therefore had a right to their own language, culture, schools - and particularly to political autonomy within Hungary. The projected expression of this autonomy was to be a Slovak Diet. Also that year, his [[brochure]] ''Das neunzehnte Jahrhundert und der Magyarismus'' ("The 19th century and Magyarism"), written in German, was published in Vienna.

=== Career in the Hungarian Diet ===

In 1846, Štúr got to know the well-situated noble family Ostrolúcky in [[Zemianske Podhradie]] (Nemesváralja), who later helped him to become a deputy in the [[Diet of Hungary]] in Pressburg. He also fell in love with [[:sk:Adela Ostrolúcka]]. In addition, his books ''Nárečja Slovenskuo alebo potreba písaňja v tomto nárečí'' (1844) and ''Nauka reči Slovenskej'' ("The Theory of the Slovak language") were published in Pressburg. In ''Nárečia Slovenskuo'', he rebutted Kollár's concept of only four [[Slavic tribes]] (Russians, Poles, Czechoslovaks and Southern Slavs), and listed reasons for the introduction of the new language, which was based on central Slovak dialects and used phonetic spelling. In ''Nauka reči Slovenskej'', he explained the grammar of the new language standard. In the same year, the upset Kollár and his followers published the compilation work „''Hlasové o potřebě jednoty spisovného jazyka pro Čechy, Moravany a Slováky''“ ("Voices in favour of the necessity of a unified literary language of the Czechs, [[Moravians (ethnic group)|Moravians]] and Slovaks"), written in Czech.

In August 1847, at the 4th convention of the Tatrín association in [[Čachtice]], Catholics and Protestants proclaimed that they "definitively agree to use only the newly codified Štúr language standard". On 30 October 1847, he became an [[ablegate]] for the town of [[Zvolen]] (Zólyom) in the "Parlamentum Publicum" (Diet) in Pressburg. From 17 November 1847 to 13 March 1848, he gave five important speeches at the Diet, in which he demanded the abolition of serfdom in Hungary, the introduction of [[civil rights]], and the use of the Slovak language in elementary schools. The Diet met only until 11 April 1848 due to the 1848 Revolution.

=== 1848/49 Revolution ===
On 1 April 1848 in Vienna, Štúr and his colleagues prepared the [[Slavic Congress of Prague]]. On 20 April 1848, he arrived in Prague on the invitation of the Czech [[Josef Václav Frič|J. V. Frič]], where he won the support of Czech student members of the association Slávie, regarding his attempts to enforce the Slovak language. On 30 April 1848, he initiated the establishment of "Slovanská lipa" (Slavic lime tree) in Prague – an association aimed at promoting the mutual cooperation of Slavs.

In May 1848, he was a co-author of the official petition, ''Žiadosti slovenského národa'' ("Requirements of the Slovak Nation"). The ''Žiadosti slovenského národa'' were publicly declared in Liptovský Svätý Mikuláš, with [[Ján Francisci-Rimavský]] as the reader. In it, the Slovaks demanded autonomy within Hungary, proportional representation in the Hungarian Assembly, the creation of a Slovak Diet to administer their own region, for Slovak to become the official language, and for educational institutions at all levels to use Slovak. They also called for [[universal suffrage]] and democratic rights – e.g., [[freedom of the press]] and public assembly. They requested that peasants be released from serfdom, and that their lands be returned to them. But on 12 May 1848, the Hungarian government issued a warrant for the leaders of the Slovak movement: Štúr, Hurban, and [[Michal Miloslav Hodža|Hodža]]. The persecuted Štúr arrived in [[Prague]] on 31 May 1848. On 2 June 1848, he participated in the Slavic Congress there.

On 19 June 1848, he went to [[Zagreb]], Croatia, because the Slavic Congress was interrupted by fighting in Prague, and became an editor of the Croatian magazine ''Slavenski Jug''. With financial support from some Serbs, he and J. M. Hurban started to prepare an uprising against the Hungarian government. The "[[Slovak Uprising 1848-1849|Slovak Uprising]]" occurred between September 1848 and November 1849. In September 1848, Štúr travelled to Vienna and participated in preparations for the Slovak armed uprising. On 15–16 September 1848, the Slovak National Council, the supreme Slovak political and military organisation, consisting of Štúr, Hurban, and Hodža (as politicians), and the Czechs B. Bloudek, F. Zach, and B. Janeček (as military experts), was created in Vienna. On 19 September 1848 in [[Myjava]], the Slovak National Council declared [[independence]] from the Hungarian government and called on the Slovak nation to start an armed uprising. However, the Council only managed to control their local region.

Štúr, Hurban, and others met in Prague on 7 October 1848 to discuss how to proceed with the uprising. Upon his return to [[Vienna]] in November, Štúr (with a group of Slovak volunteers, on one of the so-called Volunteer Campaigns) traversed northern Hungary from [[Čadca]] (Csaca), arriving in [[Prešov]] (Eperjes) in March 1849. On 20 March 1849, he led a delegation to meet with the Austrian king in the Czech town of [[Olomouc]] and presented the demands of the [[Slovakia|Slovak]] nation. From March until June, Štúr – along with Hurban, Hodža, Bórik, Chalúpka, and others – negotiated in Vienna for a solution to the Slovak demands. But on 21 November 1849, the Slovak volunteer corps was officially demobilized in Pressburg, and the disappointed Štúr retreated to his parents' home in Uhrovec.

=== Later life ===
The later years of Štúr's life saw him engage in further linguistic and literary work. In the autumn of 1850, he attempted but failed to receive a license to publish a Slovak national newspaper. In December of that year, he participated in a delegation to Vienna concerning Slovak schools and the Tatrín association. Several personal tragedies also occurred during his later life. His brother Karol died on 13 January 1851. Štúr moved into the house of Karol's family in [[Modra]] (near Pressburg) to care for his seven children. He lived there under police supervision. On 27 July 1851, his father died, and his mother moved to [[Trenčín]] (Trencsén).

In October 1851, he participated in meetings in Pressburg concerning reforms of the codified Slovak language standard. The reforms, involving mainly a transition from the phonetic spelling to an etymological one, were later introduced by M. M. Hodža and Martin Hattala in 1851–1852, but Štúr, among others, also participated in the preparations. The result of these reforms was the Slovak language standard still in use today, with only some minor changes since then.

In Modra in 1852, Štúr finished his essay ''O národních písních a pověstech plemen slovanských'' ("On national songs and myths of Slavic kin"), written in Czech and published in [[Bohemia]] the next year. In addition, he wrote his important philosophical book, ''Das Slawenthum und die Welt der Zukunft'' ("Slavdom and the world of the future"), written in German, and published in Russian in 1867 and 1909 (subsequently published in German in 1931, and in Slovak in 1993). Among other things, he recapitulated the events that brought the Slovaks to the desperate situation of that time, and suggested cooperation with Russia as a solution, thus moving away from Slovak nationalism toward [[pan-Slavism]].

In 1853, his platonic female friend, Adela, died in Vienna on 18 March. He also went to Trenčín to help care for his ill mother, until she died on 28 August. The only compilation of his poetry, ''Spevy a piesne'' ("Singings and songs"), was published in Pressburg that year. On 11 May 1854, he gave a speech at the unveiling of the Ján Hollý monument in Dobrá Voda (Ján Hollý having died in 1849). Štúr had also written a poem in his honour.

On 22 December 1855, Štúr accidentally shot and wounded himself during a hunt near Modra. In the last days of his life, he was mainly supported by his friend [[Ján Kalinčiak]]. On 12 January 1856, Ľudovít Štúr died in Modra. A national funeral was held there in his honour.

==Legacy==
Štúr has been featured on [[Czechoslovak]] and Slovak banknotes throughout the 20th century. He has appeared on the 50 Czechoslovak Koruna of 1987 and the 500 Slovak Koruna note since 1993. In his honor, the town of Parkan (Párkány in [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]]) on the Hungarian border was renamed [[Štúrovo]] in 1948.
