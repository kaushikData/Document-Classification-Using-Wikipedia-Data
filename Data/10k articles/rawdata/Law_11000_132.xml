      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3141">An '''action alert''' is a message that an organization sends to mobilize people, often members of the group and supporters of a specific point of view, calling on them to take action to influence public policy.&lt;ref name="one hour"&gt; [https://books.google.com/books?id=nN3RMP-BcnkC ''The one-hour activist: the 15 most powerful actions you can take to fight for the issues and candidates you care about''] Christopher Kush, John Wiley and Sons, 2004; {{ISBN|0-7879-7300-9}}, {{ISBN|978-0-7879-7300-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cyber"&gt; [https://books.google.com/books?id=mhRh1LH8tOMC ''Cybercitizen: How to Use Your Computer to Fight for All the Issues You Care about''] Christopher Kush, Macmillan, 2000; {{ISBN|0-312-26305-8}}, {{ISBN|978-0-312-26305-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, action alerts are in reference to a timely issue, where prompt action is needed in order to affect upcoming decisions.&lt;ref name="cyber"/&gt;

==Description==
Action alerts are considered a cost-effective and efficient grassroots organizing tool and are employed widely by many advocacy organizations.&lt;ref name="one hour"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cyber"/&gt; A well-designed action alert can be a "powerful way to invite people to participate in the processes of a democracy."&lt;ref&gt; [https://books.google.com/books?id=v5H1-i6LHu0C ''The Nonprofit Manager's Resource Directory''], Ronald A. Landskroner, John Wiley and Sons, 2001; {{ISBN|0-471-39242-1}}, {{ISBN|978-0-471-39242-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Action alerts may, for instance, ask supporters to:
*Contact their legislator to highlight the issue or argue for/against proposed legislation; or
*Write a [[letter to the editor]] about a specific item in the news.
Action alerts commonly begin by explaining the public policy issue to the recipients, and then tell the reader how they can impact the decision. Action alerts go by many other names. [[Amnesty International]], for instance, refers to them as "Urgent actions".&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url=http://web.amnesty.org/pages/ua-index-eng |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-04-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050403121614/http://web.amnesty.org/pages/ua-index-eng |archivedate=2005-04-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Advocate General for Northern Ireland''' is the chief legal adviser to the [[British Government]] on Northern Ireland law and the post is held by the [[Attorney General for England and Wales]] by virtue of that office.  The Advocate General and the [[Solicitor General for England and Wales]] have, in Northern Ireland, the same rights of audience as members of the Bar of Northern Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;section 27, Justice (Northern Ireland) Act 2002 (c.26)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Advocate General was created as a separate office upon the devolution of policing and justice powers to the [[Northern Ireland Assembly]] on 12 April 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.attorneygeneral.gov.uk/NewsCentre/Pages/Devolution.aspx Attorney General's Office: Statement on Northern Ireland devolution, 12 April 2010] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110705174807/http://www.attorneygeneral.gov.uk/NewsCentre/Pages/Devolution.aspx |date=July 5, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike the [[Advocate General for Scotland]], the position is not supported by a distinct government department.  Instead, that support is provided by the civil law and Northern Ireland section within the Attorney General's Office at Westminster.&lt;ref&gt;[http://data.gov.uk/organogram/attorney-generals-office Attorney General's Office: Structure]&lt;/ref&gt;

The chief legal adviser to the [[Northern Ireland Executive]] is the [[Attorney General for Northern Ireland]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.northernireland.gov.uk/index/media-centre/news-departments/news-ofmdfm/news-ofmdfm-may-2010/news-ofmdfm-240510-appointment-of-attorney.htm OFMDFM: Appointment of Attorney General announced, 24 May 2010] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110424105404/http://www.northernireland.gov.uk/index/media-centre/news-departments/news-ofmdfm/news-ofmdfm-may-2010/news-ofmdfm-240510-appointment-of-attorney.htm |date=24 April 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9630">An '''Agreement on the Enforcement of Sentences with the International Criminal Court''' is a formal agreement whereby a state agrees to carry out a sentence imposed by the Court. Article 103 of the [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court|Rome Statute]] of the [[International Criminal Court]] states that a "sentence of imprisonment shall be served in a State designated by the Court from a list of States which have indicated to the Court their willingness to accept sentenced persons."&lt;ref&gt;Article 103 of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court.&lt;/ref&gt; To this end, the Court has concluded Agreements with a number of states that have declared their willingness to accept sentenced persons.

== States with an agreement with the Court ==
Several states have entered into general agreements to enforce sentences imposed by the Court.

== States accepting sentenced persons by declaration and under certain circumstances ==
Some states have declared their willingness to accept their own nationals or, in some cases, their residents to serve a sentence imposed by the Court within their territory. Sometimes a state has the additional condition of the sentence not exceeding the maximum time allowed for a sentence under national law. The following states have declared their intentions in declarations made when they ratified the Rome Statute.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&amp;mtdsg_no=XVIII-10&amp;chapter=18&amp;lang=en |title=Chapter XVIII Penal Matters: 10.

'''Architectural glass''' is glass that is used as a [[building material]]. It is most typically used as transparent [[glazing in architecture|glazing]] material in the building envelope, including windows in the external walls. [[Glass]] is also used for internal partitions and as an architectural feature. When used in buildings, glass is often of a [[safety glass|safety type]], which include reinforced, toughened and laminated glasses.

==Cast glass==
[[History of glass|Glass casting]] is the process in which [[glass]] objects are [[Casting|cast]] by directing molten glass into a [[Molding (process)|mould]] where it solidifies. The technique has been used since the [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] period. Modern cast glass is formed by a variety of processes such as kiln casting, or casting into sand, graphite or metal moulds. Cast [[glass]] windows, albeit with poor optical qualities, began to appear in the most important buildings in Rome and the most luxurious villas of Herculaneum and Pompeii.&lt;ref&gt;Glass Online: [http://www.glassonline.com/infoserv/history.html A Brief History of Glass] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111024000000/http://www.glassonline.com/infoserv/history.html |date=October 24, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Crown glass==
[[File:Window_Glass_01.JPG|thumb|The concentric arcs that distort some of these panes indicate they are crown glass, possibly of the 16th century.]]
{{main|Crown glass (window)}}

One of the earliest methods of glass window manufacture was the ''crown glass'' method. Hot blown glass was cut open opposite the pipe, then rapidly spun on a table before it could cool. Centrifugal force shaped the hot globe of glass into a round, flat sheet. The sheet would then be broken off the pipe and trimmed to form a rectangular window to fit into a frame.

At the center of a piece of crown glass, a thick remnant of the original blown bottle neck would remain, hence the name "bullseye". Optical distortions produced by the bullseye could be reduced by grinding the glass. The development of [[diapering|diaper]] latticed windows was in part because three regular diamond-shaped panes could be conveniently cut from a piece of Crown glass, with minimum waste and with minimum distortion.

This method for manufacturing [[flat glass]] panels was very expensive and could not be used to make large panes. It was replaced in the 19th century by the cylinder, sheet, and rolled plate processes, but it is still used in traditional construction and restoration.

==Cylinder glass==
{{main|Cylinder blown sheet|Machine drawn cylinder sheet}}

In this manufacturing process, glass is blown into a cylindrical iron mould. The ends are cut off and a cut is made down the side of the cylinder. The cut cylinder is then placed in an oven where the cylinder unrolls into a flat glass sheets.

==Drawn Sheet glass (Fourcault process)==
[[File:DistortedGlass.wmg.jpg|right|thumb|The uneven surface of old glass is visible in the reflection on this window pane.]]
Drawn Sheet glass was made by dipping a leader into a vat of molten glass then pulling that leader straight up while a film of glass hardened just out of the vat – this is known as the [[Fourcault process]].  This film or ribbon was pulled up continuously held by tractors on both edges while it cooled.  After 12 metres or so it was cut off the vertical ribbon and tipped down to be further cut.  This glass is clear but has thickness variations due to small temperature changes just out of the vat as it was hardening. These variations cause lines of slight distortions. This glass may still be seen in older houses.  Float glass replaced this process.

==Cast plate glass==

Developed by James Hartledsay in 1848. The glass is taken from the furnace in large iron ladles, which are carried upon slings running on overhead rails; from the ladle the glass is thrown upon the cast-iron bed of a rolling-table; and is rolled into sheet by an iron roller, the process being similar to that employed in making plate-glass, but on a smaller scale. The sheet thus rolled is roughly trimmed while hot and soft, so as to remove those portions of glass which have been spoiled by immediate contact with the ladle, and the sheet, still soft, is pushed into the open mouth of an annealing tunnel or temperature-controlled oven called a [[lehr (glassmaking)|lehr]], down which it is carried by a system of rollers.

==Polished plate glass==

{{main|Polished plate}}
The polished plate glass process starts with sheet or rolled plate glass.  This glass is dimensionally inaccurate and often created visual distortions.  These rough panes were ground flat and then polished clear.  This was a fairly expensive process.

Before the float process, mirrors were plate glass as sheet glass had visual distortions that were akin to those seen in amusement park or funfair mirrors.

==Rolled plate (figured) glass==
[[File:Domestic glass bathroom 01.JPG|thumb|Figure rolled glass]]
The elaborate patterns found on figured (or 'Cathedral') rolled-plate glass are produced in a similar fashion to the rolled plate glass process except that the plate is cast between two rollers, one of which carries a pattern. On occasion, both rollers can carry a pattern. The pattern is impressed upon the sheet by a printing roller which is brought down upon the glass as it leaves the main rolls while still soft. This glass shows a pattern in high relief. The glass is then annealed in a [[lehr (glassmaking)|lehr]].

The glass used for this purpose is typically whiter in colour than the clear glasses used for other applications.

This glass can be laminated or toughened depending on the depth of the pattern to produce a safety glass.

==Float glass==

{{main|Float glass}}
Ninety percent of the world's flat glass is produced by the [[float glass]] process{{cn|date=February 2017}} invented in the 1950s by Sir [[Alastair Pilkington]] of [[Pilkington Glass]], in which molten glass is poured onto one end of a molten [[tin]] bath. The glass floats on the tin, and levels out as it spreads along the bath, giving a smooth face to both sides. The glass cools and slowly solidifies as it travels over the molten tin and leaves the tin bath in a continuous ribbon. The glass is then annealed by cooling in an oven called a [[lehr (glassmaking)|lehr]]. The finished product has near-perfect parallel surfaces.

The side of the glass that has been in contact with the tin has a very small amount of the tin embedded in its surface. This quality makes that side of the glass easier to be coated in order to turn it into a mirror, however that side is also softer and easier to scratch.

Glass is produced in standard metric thicknesses of 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 19 and 22&amp;nbsp;mm, with 10mm being the most popular sizing in the architectural industry. Molten glass floating on tin in a nitrogen/hydrogen atmosphere will spread out to a thickness of about 6&amp;nbsp;mm and stop due to [[surface tension]]. Thinner glass is made by stretching the glass while it floats on the tin and cools. Similarly, thicker glass is pushed back and not permitted to expand as it cools on the tin.

==Prism glass==
{{main|Prism lighting}}
[[Prism glass]] is architectural glass which bends light. It was frequently used around the turn of the 20th century to provide natural light to underground spaces and areas far from windows.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last = Alter | first = Lloyd | title = Landmarks not Landfill: Prism glass | publisher = TreeHugger| date = May 30, 2008| url = http://www.treehugger.com/files/2008/05/prism-glass.php| accessdate = April 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prism glass can be found on sidewalks, where it is known as [[vault light]]ing,&lt;ref&gt;Ian Macky: [http://www.glassian.org/Prism/ Prism glass]&lt;/ref&gt; in windows, partitions, and canopies, where it is known as [[prism tiles]], and as [[deck prism]]s, which were used to light spaces below deck on sailing ships. It could be highly ornamented; [[Frank Lloyd Wright]] created over forty different designs for prism tiles.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} Modern architectural [[prism lighting]] is generally done with a plastic film applied to ordinary window glass.

==Glass block==

{{main|Glass brick}}
[[File:BurlingtonHousePavementWindow.jpg|thumbnail|Sidewalk skylight (also named '[[pavement light]]') outside [[Burlington House]], [[London]]]]
Glass block, also known as glass brick, is an architectural element made from [[glass]] used in areas where privacy or visual obscuration is desired while admitting light, such as underground parking garages, washrooms, and municipal swimming baths. Glass block was originally developed in the early 1900s to provide natural light in [[Factory|industrial factories]].

==Annealed glass==

[[Annealing (glass)|Annealed glass]] is glass without internal stresses caused by heat treatment, i.e., rapid cooling, or by toughening or heat strengthening. Glass becomes annealed if it is heated above a transition point then allowed to cool slowly, without being quenched. Float glass is annealed during the process of manufacture. However, most toughened glass is made from float glass that has been specially heat-treated.

Annealed glass breaks into large, jagged shards that can cause serious injury and is considered a hazard in [[architecture|architectural]] applications. [[Building code]]s in many parts of the world restrict the use of annealed glass in areas where there is a high [[risk]] of breakage and [[injury]], for example in [[bathroom]]s, [[door]] panels, [[fire exit]]s and at low heights in [[school]]s or domestic houses. [[Safety glass]], such as [[Laminated glass|laminated]] or [[Toughened glass|tempered]] must be used in these settings to reduce risk of injury. 

==Laminated glass==
{{main|Laminated glass}}
[[File:Broken Laminated glass.JPG|thumb|Broken tempered laminated glass "wet blanket effect"]]

Laminated glass is manufactured by bonding two or more layers of glass together with an interlayer, such as [[Polyvinyl butyral|PVB]], under heat and pressure, to create a single sheet of glass. When broken, the interlayer keeps the layers of glass bonded and prevents it from breaking apart. The interlayer can also give the glass a higher [[sound insulation]] rating.

There are several types of laminated glasses manufactured using different types of glass and interlayers which produce different results when broken.

Laminated glass that is made up of annealed glass is normally used when safety is a concern, but tempering is not an option. [[Windshield]]s are typically laminated glasses. When broken, the PVB layer prevents the glass from breaking apart, creating a "spider web" cracking pattern.

Tempered laminated glass is designed to shatter into small pieces, preventing possible injury. When both pieces of glass are broken it produces a "wet blanket" effect and it will fall out of its opening.

Heat strengthened laminated glass is stronger than annealed, but not as strong as tempered. It is often used where security is a concern. It has a larger break pattern than tempered, but because it holds its shape (unlike the "wet blanket" effect of tempered laminated glass) it remains in the opening and can withstand more force for a longer period of time, making it much more difficult to get through.

Laminated glass has similar properties to [[Bulletproof glass|ballistic glass]], but the two should not be confused. Both are made using a PVB interlayer, but they have drastically different tensile strength. Ballistic glass and laminated glass are both rated to different standards and have a different shatter pattern.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://barrettlimited.com/barrett-news/the-difference-between-tempered-glass-and-ballistic-glass/|title=The Difference Between Tempered Glass and Ballistic Glass {{!}} Barrett Limited|website=barrettlimited.com|language=en-CA|access-date=2018-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Heat-strengthened glass==

Heat-strengthened glass, or tempered glass, is glass that has been heat treated to induce surface compression, but not to the extent of causing it to "dice" on breaking in the manner of tempered glass. On breaking, heat-strengthened glass breaks into sharp pieces that are typically somewhat smaller than those found on breaking annealed glass, and is intermediate in strength between annealed and toughened glasses.

Heat-strengthened glass can take a strong direct hit without shattering, but has a weak edge. By simply tapping the edge of heat-strengthened glass with a solid object, it is possible to shatter the entire sheet. 

==Chemically strengthened glass==
{{main|Chemically strengthened glass}}
Chemically strengthened glass is a type of glass that has increased strength.  When broken it still shatters in long pointed splinters similar to float (annealed) glass.  For this reason, it is not considered a safety glass and must be laminated if a safety glass is required. Chemically strengthened glass is typically six to eight times the strength of annealed glass.

The glass is chemically strengthened by submerging the glass in a bath containing a potassium salt (typically potassium nitrate) at {{convert|450|°C|0|abbr=on}}. This causes sodium ions in the glass surface to be replaced by potassium ions from the bath solution.

Unlike toughened glass, chemically strengthened glass may be cut after strengthening, but loses its added strength within the region of approximately 20&amp;nbsp;mm of the cut.  Similarly, when the surface of chemically strengthened glass is deeply scratched, this area loses its additional strength.

Chemically strengthened glass was used on some [[fighter aircraft]] [[Aircraft canopy|canopies]].

==Low-emissivity glass==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Solar collector]] --&gt;
{{main|Low-emissivity}}
Glass coated with a low-emissivity substance can reflect radiant infrared energy, encouraging radiant heat to remain on the same side of the glass from which it originated, while letting visible light pass. This often results in more efficient windows because radiant heat originating from indoors in winter is reflected back inside, while infrared heat radiation from the sun during summer is reflected away, keeping it cooler inside.

==Heatable glass==
{{main|Heatable glass}}
Electrically heatable [[glass]] is a relatively new product, which helps to find solutions while designing buildings and vehicles.
The idea of heating glass is based on usage of [[Efficient energy use|energy-efficient]] [[Low emissivity|low-emissive]] glass that is generally simple [[silicate glass]] with special metallic [[oxides]] coating. Heatable glass can be used in all kinds of standard [[glazing (window)|glazing]] systems, made of wood, plastic, aluminum or steel.

==Self-cleaning glass==
A recent (2001 Pilkington Glass) innovation is so-called [[self-cleaning glass]], aimed at building, automotive and other technical applications. A nanometre-scale coating of [[titanium dioxide]] on the outer surface of glass introduces two mechanisms which lead to the self-cleaning property. The first is a photo-catalytic effect, in which [[ultra-violet]] rays catalyse the breakdown of organic compounds on the window surface; the second is a [[hydrophilic]] effect in which water is attracted to the surface of the glass, forming a thin sheet which washes away the broken-down organic compounds.

==Insulating glass==

{{main|Insulating glass}}
Insulating glass, or double glazing, consists of a [[window]] or glazing element of two or more layers of glazing separated by a spacer along the edge and sealed to create a dead air space between the layers.  This type of glazing has functions of thermal insulation and [[noise reduction]]. When the space is filled with an inert gas it is part of [[energy conservation]] [[sustainable architecture]] design for [[low energy building]]s.

==Evacuated glazing==

A 1994 innovation for insulated glazing is evacuated glass, which as yet is produced commercially only in Japan and China.&lt;ref&gt;Sumitomo Group Public Affairs [http://www.sumitomo.gr.jp/english/discoveries/special/89_05.html World’s First Evacuated Glazing Glass]&lt;/ref&gt; The extreme thinness of evacuated glazing offers many new architectural possibilities, particularly in building conservation and historicist architecture, where evacuated glazing can replace traditional single glazing, which is much less energy-efficient.

An evacuated glazing unit is made by sealing the edges of two glass sheets, typically by using a solder glass, and evacuating the space inside with a vacuum pump. The evacuated space between the two sheets can be very shallow and yet be a good insulator, yielding insulative window glass with nominal thicknesses as low as 6&amp;nbsp;mm overall. The reasons for this low thickness are deceptively complex, but the potential insulation is good essentially because there can be no convection or gaseous conduction in a vacuum.

Unfortunately, evacuated glazing does have some disadvantages; its manufacture is complicated and difficult. For example, a necessary stage in the manufacture of evacuated glazing is [[outgassing]]; that is, heating it to liberate any gases adsorbed on the inner surfaces, which could otherwise later escape and destroy the vacuum. This heating process currently means that evacuated glazing cannot be toughened or heat-strengthened. If an evacuated safety glass is required, the glass must be laminated. The high temperatures necessary for outgassing also tend to destroy the highly effective "soft" [[low-emissivity]] coatings that are often applied to one or both of the internal surfaces (i.e. the ones facing the air gap) of other forms of modern insulative glazing, in order to prevent loss of heat through [[infrared]] radiation. Slightly less effective "hard" coatings are still suitable for evacuated glazing, however.

Furthermore, because of the atmospheric pressure present on the outside of an evacuated glazing unit, its two glass sheets must somehow be held apart in order to prevent them flexing together and touching each other, which would defeat the object of evacuating the unit. The task of holding the panes apart is performed by a grid of spacers, which typically consist of small stainless steel discs that are placed around 20&amp;nbsp;mm apart. The spacers are small enough that they are visible only at very close distances, typically up to 1 m. However, the fact that the spacers will conduct some heat often leads in cold weather to the formation of temporary, grid-shaped patterns on the surface of an evacuated window, consisting either of small circles of interior condensation centred around the spacers, where the glass is slightly colder than average, or, when there is dew outside, small circles on the exterior face of the glass, in which the dew is absent because the spacers make the glass near them slightly warmer.

The conduction of heat between the panes, caused by the spacers, tends to limit evacuated glazing’s overall insulative effectiveness. Nevertheless, evacuated glazing is still as insulative as much thicker conventional double glazing and tends to be stronger, since the two constituent glass sheets are pressed together by the atmosphere, and hence react practically as one thick sheet to bending forces. Evacuated glazing also offers very good sound insulation in comparison with other popular types of window glazing.

==Building code seismic requirements==
The most current building code enforced in most jurisdictions in the United States is the 2006 International Building Code (IBC, 2006). The 2006 IBC references for the 2005 edition of the standard Minimum Design Loads for buildings and other Structures prepared by the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE, 2005) for its seismic provisions. ASCE 7-05 contains specific requirements for nonstructural components including requirements for architectural glass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Behr | first = R A | title = Architectural glass to resist seismic and extreme climatic events | publisher = Woodhead Publishing Limited | year = 2009 | isbn = 978-1-84569-369-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Danger of reflected sunlight==
If incorrectly designed, [[Concave mirror|concave]] surfaces with extensive amounts of glass can act as [[solar concentrator]]s depending on the angle of the sun, potentially injuring people and damaging property.&lt;ref&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/2013/09/03/world/europe/uk-london-building-melts-car/index.html Reflected light from London skyscraper melts car]&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "'''anchor babies in Hong Kong'''" ({{lang-zh|c=雙非嬰兒|links=no}}) refers to children born in Hong Kong whose parents (usually from [[Mainland China]]) are not [[Permanent residents of Hong Kong|Hong Kong permanent residents]].

Since 2003, an [[Individual Visit Scheme]] targeted to boost the economy of Hong Kong has begun. It provides an opportunity for pregnant women visiting from Mainland China to give birth to their infants in Hong Kong. This entitles their children to the [[right of abode in Hong Kong]] as well as the opportunity to benefit from Hong Kong's education system.

These pregnant women use local obstetric services through legal (e.g. births through reservation) or illegal (e.g. A&amp;E births) ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{zh icon}}[http://news.163.com/12/1006/07/8D47N0GM00014JB6.html 香港“双非”孕妇冲急症室人数再见新低]&lt;/ref&gt; The large influx of visiting Mainland pregnant women causes a shortage of hospital resources, resulting in much criticism of visiting pregnant women and their anchor children,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sinosplice.com/life/archives/2009/10/15/hong-kong-maternity-tourism |title=Hong Kong Maternity Tourism |publisher=Sinosplice |date=15 October 2009 |accessdate=15 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; including labelling them as "locusts".&lt;ref&gt;{{zh icon}}[http://www.isunaffairs.com/?p=3412 控制雙非孕婦只需行政手段 iSun Affairs] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121107121537/http://www.isunaffairs.com/?p=3412 |date=7 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Over 170,000&lt;ref&gt;{{zh icon}}[http://news.sina.com.hk/news/20120208/-1-2571880/1.html 自由黨倡停發雙非嬰居港權] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131218072805/http://news.sina.com.hk/news/20120208/-1-2571880/1.html |date=18 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; new births were anchor babies between 2001 and 2011 in which 32,653 were born in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/201105/11/P201105110171.htm LCQ4: Obstetric services]&lt;/ref&gt;

The trial court instructed the jury to find the defendant liable if the failure to diagnose was deemed a substantial factor in the decedent's death.  The jury found for the plaintiff and the defendant appealed.&lt;ref&gt;Henderson, p. 263&lt;/ref&gt;

The Supreme Court of Indiana eschewed the substantial factor test for liability because it would unfairly hold doctors liable for the patient's underlying disease and all of the damage it caused.  Instead the court adopted the loss of a chance doctrine,which allows recovery if negligence results in a substantially higher probability that harm to the plaintiff will result, even if the probability of harm is already over fifty percent.  The court held that the defendants should only be held liable in proportion to the increased chance of harm caused by their negligence, and the case was [[remanded]] for a new trial.&lt;ref&gt;Henderson, p. 264&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact==
''Cahoon'' places Indiana among 24 other states that recognize the loss of a chance doctrine, which has been criticized for unpredictably increasing [[medical malpractice]] liability.&lt;ref&gt;[http://goliath.ecnext.com/coms2/gi_0199-3026884/Loss-of-chance-in-medical.html ''Loss of chance in medical malpractice: a look at recent developments: the growing acceptance of this doctrine raises difficult public policy issues, as well as concerns for the limits of medical professional liability.''  Defense Counsel Journal.  1 July 2003.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Canada Highways Act''' was a 1919 [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of Canada|Dominion Parliament]] of Canada. The act established a fund to support the construction of [[Numbered highways in Canada|provincial highways]] as part of the post-[[World War&amp;nbsp;I]] reconstruction program of [[Robert Borden]]'s [[Unionist Party (Canada)|Union]] government.

==Background==
In the mid-nineteenth century, the primary modes of transportation were [[Rail transport in Canada|rail]] and [[ship transport|waterways]], and authority over them was granted to the federal government under Canada's [[Section 92(10) of the Constitution Act, 1867|Constitution]]; roads were thought of as a local concern and were delegated to the provinces.&lt;ref name="padova"/&gt;&lt;ref name="monaghan"/&gt; As the automobile rose in prominence in the early 20th century, organizations such as the [[Good Roads Movement]] and local [[motor club]]s put pressure on governments to provide improved roads.{{sfnp|Monaghan|1997|pp=10–11}} Several provinces established their own highway authorities to coordinate the development of regional road networks. The federal government's first effort to fund highway construction came with the Railway Grade Crossing Fund in 1907.{{sfnp|Monaghan|1997|pp=17–18}}

[[Robert Borden]]'s [[Conservative Party of Canada (1867–1942)|Conservative]] government first proposed a federal assistance program for provincial road construction in 1913, but the program was rejected by the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]]-dominated [[Senate of Canada|Senate]] over opposition to acting in an area of provincial jurisdiction.{{sfnp|Monaghan|1997|p=18}} Interest in road funding was put aside during [[World War&amp;nbsp;I]], however automobile interest groups (including the 1915 establishment of the [[Canadian Automobile Association]]) maintained pressure on the federal government. Following the war, Borden's [[Unionist Party (Canada)|Union]] government established a reconstruction program including the Canada Highways Act, which passed in 1919.&lt;ref name="padova"/&gt;{{sfnp|Monaghan|1997|p=19}}

==Highways funding==
The act established a fund to provide financial assistance to provincial highway projects, with an emphasis on encouraging interprovincial highway connections. The fund, administered by the [[Department of Railways and Canals]], provided a maximum of $20&amp;nbsp;million to approved projects between 1&amp;nbsp;April 1919 and 31&amp;nbsp;March 1924. To qualify for funding, a province was required to develop a five-year provincial highways plan, including primary and secondary designations. Upon approval, the Dominion fund would subsidize 40% of the cost of construction.{{sfnp|Monaghan|1997|pp=19–20}}

Work on provincial highways proceeded more slowly than anticipated. The fund was not depleted as of the expiry date in 1924, and so the deadline was extended to 31&amp;nbsp;March 1928.&lt;ref name="lewiston" /&gt; A report prepared by the Department showed that the fund contributed $19,596,388 toward $48,990,092 of provincial road construction, funding {{convert|8415|mi|km}} of roads in all nine provinces.{{ref|Nfld|[a]}}&lt;ref name="padova" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lewiston" /&gt;

==Notes==
:{{note label|Nfld|[a]}} [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]] did not become a province until 1949 and thus did not benefit from Canada Highways Act funding.

The '''Charter of the French Language''' ({{lang-fr|link=no|La charte de la langue française}}), also known as '''Bill 101''' (''Law 101 or {{lang-fr|link=no|Loi 101}}''), is a 1977 law in the [[Provinces and territories of Canada|province]] of [[Quebec]] in Canada defining [[French language in Canada|French]], the language of the majority of the population, as the [[official language]] of the provincial government. It is the central legislative piece in Quebec's [[language policy]].

Proposed by [[Camille Laurin]], the Minister of Cultural Development under the first [[Parti Québécois]] government of Premier [[René Lévesque]], it was passed by the [[National Assembly of Quebec|National Assembly]], and granted [[Royal Assent]] by [[Lieutenant Governor of Quebec|Lieutenant Governor]] [[Hugues Lapointe]] on August 26, 1977. The Charter's provisions expanded upon the 1974 ''[[Official Language Act (Quebec)|Official Language Act]]'' (Bill 22), which was enacted by the Lieutenant Governor-in-Parliament during the tenure of Premier [[Robert Bourassa]]'s [[Parti libéral du Québec|Liberal]] government to make French the official language of Quebec. Prior to 1974, Quebec had no official language and was subject only to the requirements on the use of English and French contained in Article 133 of the [[Constitution Act, 1867|British North America Act, 1867]].&lt;ref&gt;"[[s:British North America Act 1867#133.|British North America Act, 1867]]", in ''Wikisource''. Retrieved April 24, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Bill 101 has been amended more than six times since 1977. Each amendment has aroused controversy over such provisions as the use of French on commercial signs or restrictions on enrolment into anglophone schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/debate-on-pq-language-bill-to-begin/article9582744/ | location=Toronto | work=The Globe and Mail | title=Debate on PQ language bill to begin | date=March 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Objective==
The preamble of the Charter states that the National Assembly resolved "to make French the language of Government and the Law, as well as the normal and everyday language of work, instruction, communication, commerce and business". It also states that the National Assembly is to pursue this objective "in a spirit of fairness and open-mindedness", recognizes "the right of the [[Amerind peoples|Amerinds]] and the [[Nunavik|Inuit of Quebec]], the first inhabitants of this land, to preserve and develop their original language and culture".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oqlf.gouv.qc.ca/english/charter/preamble.html The Charter of the French Language — Preamble] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070402153735/http://www.oqlf.gouv.qc.ca/english/charter/preamble.html |date=April 2, 2007 }}, on the Web site of the ''Office québécois de la langue française''. Retrieved April 23, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Titles==
The Charter of the French language consists of six titles and two schedules.

The nine chapters of Title I, pertaining to the status of the French language, declare French the sole official (chapter I), define the fundamental language rights of persons (chapter II), and defines the status of French in the parliament and the courts (chapter III), the civil administration (chapter IV), the semipublic agencies (chapter V), labour relations (VI), commerce and business (VII), and language of instruction (VIII).&lt;ref&gt;Charter of the French Language, [http://www.oqlf.gouv.qc.ca/english/charter/index.html#t1status Title I]&lt;/ref&gt;

The five chapters of Title II, pertain to linguistic officialization, [[toponymy]], and the francization of the civil service and enterprises.&lt;ref&gt;Charter of the French Language, [http://www.oqlf.gouv.qc.ca/english/charter/index.html#t2olf Title II]&lt;/ref&gt;

Title III establishes the [[Office québécois de la langue française]] (Quebec Office of the French language), defines its mission, powers, and organization.&lt;ref&gt;Charter of the French Language, [http://www.oqlf.gouv.qc.ca/english/charter/index.html#t3cplf Title III]&lt;/ref&gt;

Title IV establishes the [[Conseil supérieur de la langue française (Quebec)|Conseil supérieur de la langue française]] (Superior Council of the French language).&lt;ref&gt;Charter of the French Language, [http://www.oqlf.gouv.qc.ca/english/charter/index.html#t4clf Title IV]&lt;/ref&gt;

Title V and VI define penal provisions and sanctions and transitional and miscellaneous provisions.&lt;ref&gt;Charter of the French Language, [http://www.oqlf.gouv.qc.ca/english/charter/index.html#t5penal Title V]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Charter of the French Language, [http://www.oqlf.gouv.qc.ca/english/charter/index.html Title IV]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Status of the French language==
To achieve the goal of making French the "normal and everyday language of work, instruction, communication, commerce and business" and ensure the respect of French Quebecers' language rights, the Charter contains a number of key provisions and various regulations.

===Official language===
In the first article of the Charter, French is declared the official language of Quebec.&lt;ref&gt;Charter of the French Language, [http://www.oqlf.gouv.qc.ca/english/charter/title1chapter1.html Title I – Chapter I] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070404131758/http://www.oqlf.gouv.qc.ca/english/charter/title1chapter1.html |date=April 4, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The French language was previously declared the sole official language of Quebec with the adoption of the ''[[Official Language Act (Quebec)|Official Language Act]]'' in 1974. Quebec is constitutionally obliged nonetheless to provide English services in the courts and the [[National Assembly of Quebec]] (see below).

===Fundamental language rights===
The fundamental French language rights in Quebec are:

# The right to have the civil administration, the health services and social services, the public utility enterprises, the professional corporations, the associations of employees and all enterprises doing business in Quebec communicate with the public in French. (article 2)
# The right to speak French in deliberative assemblies. (article 3)
# The right of workers to carry on their activities in French. (article 4)
# The right of consumers to be informed and served in French. (article 5)
# The right of persons eligible for instruction in Quebec to receive that instruction in French. (article 6)

===Parliament and courts===
French is the declared language of the legislature and courts in Quebec. Section 133 of the ''Constitution Act, 1867'', still in effect, nonetheless requires that bills be printed, published, passed, and assented to in French and in English in Parliaments and the legislatures of Canada and of Quebec.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/Const/page-7.html#h-29 |title=Constitution Acts, 1867 to 1982 |publisher=Laws-lois.justice.gc.ca |accessdate=29 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

French or English may be used by any person before the courts of Quebec. Parties may request the translation in French or English of the judgments by the courts or decisions rendered by any "body discharging quasi-judicial functions".

The French text prevails over the English one, in case of any discrepancy, for any regulation to which section 133 of the Constitution Act of 1867 does not apply.&lt;ref&gt;Charter of the French Language, [http://www.oqlf.gouv.qc.ca/english/charter/title1chapter3.html Title I&amp;nbsp;– Chapter III] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061125003301/http://www.oqlf.gouv.qc.ca/english/charter/title1chapter3.html |date=November 25, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first version of the Charter of the French Language provided that laws be enacted only in French. In 1979, the related provisions (articles 7 through 13) were rendered inoperative by a ruling of the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] in ''[[Attorney General of Quebec v. Blaikie (No. 1)|Attorney General of Quebec v. Blaikie]]''; however, Quebec responded by re-enacting in French and in English the Charter of the French Language, leaving intact articles 7 through 13.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oqlf.gouv.qc.ca/charte/reperes/reperes.html Repère et jalons historiques], on the Web site of the ''Office québécois de la langue française''. Retrieved April 28, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, the Charter's provisions related to the language of the legislature and courts were made compliant with the Supreme Court's ruling.

===Civil administration===
The government departments, agencies are designated by their French name alone, all administrative documents are drafted and published in the official language. All communications by the administration with other governments and legal persons, between departments and internally inside departments, are conducted in the official language.

Knowledge of the official language appropriate to the office being applied for is required.

A non-official language may be used on signs and posters of the administration for health or public safety reasons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oqlf.gouv.qc.ca/english/charter/title1chapter4.html The Charter of the French Language – Title I – Chapter IV] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061125003237/http://www.oqlf.gouv.qc.ca/english/charter/title1chapter4.html |date=November 25, 2006 }}, on the Web site of the ''Office québécois de la langue française''. Retrieved April 28, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

===Semipublic agencies===
Public utilities and professional orders must provide service in the official language and use it for their internal and general communications. Professional orders may issue permits only to persons who have a knowledge of the official language appropriate to the practice of their profession.&lt;ref&gt;Charter of the French Language, [http://www.oqlf.gouv.qc.ca/english/charter/title1chapter5.html Title I – Chapter V] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061129164458/http://www.oqlf.gouv.qc.ca/english/charter/title1chapter5.html |date=November 29, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Labour relations===
Ten articles of the charter provide for the general goal of making French the language of labour relations.

Employers are to draw up written communications to their staff and publish job offers or promotions in the official language.

An employer cannot dismiss, lay off, demote or transfer a staff member on the sole account of his being exclusively French-speaking or of possessing insufficient knowledge of a non-official language, or because that member demanded the respect of his right to work in French. As a job requirement, knowledge or a specific level of knowledge of a language other than French is prohibited, unless the nature of the duties require it.

The ''Commission des relations du travail'' (Commission of Labour Relations) arbitrates in case of disagreement over the necessity of knowing a non-official language to perform a given work. The burden of the proof is on the employer.&lt;ref&gt;Charter of the French Language, [http://www.oqlf.gouv.qc.ca/english/charter/title1chapter6.html Title I – Chapter VI] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061008032946/http://www.oqlf.gouv.qc.ca/english/charter/title1chapter6.html |date=October 8, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Commerce and business===
Product labels, their instructions, manuals, warranty certificates as well as restaurant menus and wine lists must be in French. Other languages may be used, provided French's prominence is at least equivalent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oqlf.gouv.qc.ca/english/charter/title1chapter7.html The Charter of the French Language – Title I – Chapter VII] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070402090304/http://www.oqlf.gouv.qc.ca/english/charter/title1chapter7.html |date=April 2, 2007 }}.

Retrieved May 10, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Catalogues, brochures, folders, commercial directories and other such publications, must be in French. All software (for example, video games and operating systems) must be available in French unless no French version exists.&lt;ref&gt;Charter of the French Language, [http://www.olf.gouv.qc.ca/english/charter/title1chapter7.html Title I – Chapter VII, Section 52.1] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090902010854/http://www.olf.gouv.qc.ca/english/charter/title1chapter7.html |date=September 2, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Signs and posters must be in French, and they may also be in another language provided French is markedly predominant.

A number of exceptions to the general rules for commercial products, signs, and advertising:

* Products destined exclusively for export;
* Educational products for the teaching of a language other than French;
* Cultural and ideological companies, groups, signs, and literature (including non-French broadcasters and newspapers);
* Companies (usually multinational corporations) that sign an agreement with the OQLF permitting an exemption from the francization requirement. (However, the rules regarding the right of a worker to work in French still apply.)&lt;ref&gt;Charter of the French Language, [http://www.oqlf.gouv.qc.ca/english/charter/title1chapter7.html Title I – Chapter VII] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070402090304/http://www.oqlf.gouv.qc.ca/english/charter/title1chapter7.html |date=April 2, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some parts of Quebec like Montreal, signs with bilingual French and English text of equal sizes can be seen (such as in historically English educational institutions, and in federally regulated businesses), although French is sometimes predominant on these signs. For example, French is located to the left of other languages so that it is read "before" the non-French text when reading left to right. (Formerly, the size and colour of text in other languages were tightly regulated as well.)

===Application to indigenous languages===
Though Article 97 clarifies that while "the Indian reserves are not subject to this Act", the local indigenous language is still subject to it off-reserve. For example, the local indigenous language is not exempted from the application of Article 58, whereby "public signs, advertising and posters must be in French", and may be in the local indigenous language "provided that French is markedly predominant".

Though Article 58 does allow the provincial government to "determine by regulation the places, cases, conditions or circumstances ... where French need not be predominant or where such signs, posters and advertising may be in another language only", it imposes no obligation on the government to exempt the local indigenous language.

===Language of instruction===
{{Further|Education in Quebec}}
The language of instruction from kindergarten to secondary school is French. (The instruction language is the language in which the classes are taught. Learning of English as a second language is mandatory for all children attending French school beginning in elementary school.)

Articles 87, 88 and 89 provide for the use of [[Amerindian languages|Amerindic languages]] and [[Inuktitut]] as language of instruction. The rate of introduction of French and English as languages of instruction is left to school committees and parents' committees.&lt;ref name="Title I - Chapter VIII"&gt;Charter of the French Language, [http://www.oqlf.gouv.qc.ca/english/charter/title1chapter8.html Title I – Chapter VIII] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061129164447/http://www.oqlf.gouv.qc.ca/english/charter/title1chapter8.html |date=November 29, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the request of parents, the following may receive instruction in English:

# a child whose father or mother is a Canadian citizen and received elementary instruction in English anywhere in Canada, provided that that instruction constitutes the major part of the elementary instruction he/she received in Canada;
# a child whose father or mother is a Canadian citizen and who has received or is receiving elementary or secondary instruction in English in Canada, and the brothers and sisters of that child, provided that that instruction constitutes the major part of the elementary or secondary instruction received by the child in Canada.

The original 1977 Charter provided for the English instruction not on the basis of a parent having received his instruction in English in ''Canada'', but in ''Quebec'' only. This came to be amended following the adoption of the ''[[Constitution Act 1982]]'', which defined the educational right of French and English minorities in all provinces under [[Section Twenty-three of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|section 23]] of the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]].

==Legal dispute==
{{unreferenced|section|date=August 2017}}
{{Main|Legal dispute over Quebec's language policy}}

Language in Canada is defined federally by the [[Official Languages Act (Canada)|Official Languages Act]] since 1969 and is part of the [[Constitution of Canada]] since 1982. Parts of the Charter of the French language have been amended in response to rulings by Quebec Courts which were upheld by the [[Supreme Court of Canada]].

Before 1982, the only part of the Charter of the French Language that could be challenged constitutionally was that of the language of legislation and the courts. It was challenged in 1979 by [[Peter Blaikie]], [[Roland Durand]] and [[Yoine Goldstein]] (''[[Attorney General of Quebec v. Blaikie (No. 1)|Attorney General of Quebec v. Blaikie]]'').

In 1982, the [[patriation]] of the Canadian constitution occurred as the British Parliament passed the ''[[Canada Act 1982]]''. This act enacted the ''[[Constitution Act, 1982]]'' for Canada (including the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]]); [[Section Twenty-three of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|section 23]] introduced the notion of "minority-language education rights". This opened another door to a constitutional dispute of Quebec's Charter of the French Language.

[[Alliance Quebec]], an anglophone rights lobby group, was founded in May 1982. It is mainly through this civil association that a number of lawyers have challenged the constitutionality of Quebec's territorial language policy.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

==Criticism==
The Charter of the French Language has been strongly condemned and widely unpopular among most of English-speaking Canadians, who constitute the majority of Canadians but are a minority in Quebec.

The Charter was criticised by Prime Minister [[Pierre Trudeau]], who called Bourassa's Bill 22 as a "slap in the face", in his memoirs,{{which|date=June 2013}} as he saw it as contrary to the federal government's initiative to [[Official bilingualism in Canada|mandate bilingualism]]. Except for New Brunswick, most other provinces that accepted Trudeau's bilingualism initiative never fully implemented it. The most notable case was [[Ontario]], where Premier [[Bill Davis]] did not grant full official status to the French language, despite the fact that the infrastructure was already in place.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=A1ARTA0002156  "French Language in Canada"]. ''The Canadian Encyclopedia'' May 14, 2006 &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/quebec-language-policy/ "Quebec Language" ] ''The Canadian Encyclopedia'' May 19, 2008 &lt;/ref&gt;

Political opposition to the Charter and earlier such language legislation has had limited success, given the support of the laws by the Parti Québécois and Quebec Liberal Party. Legislative initiatives prior to Bill 101 were often perceived by francophones as insufficient,{{clarify|date=June 2013}} such as ''[[An Act to promote the French language in Quebec]]'' (Bill 63). After Bourassa passed the [[Official Language Act (Quebec)|''Official Language Act'']], opponents turned their support to the [[Union Nationale (Quebec)|Union Nationale]] in the 1976 election, but despite that short resurgence of support, the party collapsed in the subsequent election. Court challenges have been more successful:  Many of the key provisions of the initial language legislation having been rewritten to comply with rulings.  Despite compliance since 1993 of the Charter with the Canadian constitution, opposition to the Charter and the government body enforcing it has continued.

According to Statistics Canada, up to 244,000 English-speaking people have emigrated from Quebec to other provinces since the 1970s; those in Quebec whose sole native language was English dropped from 789,000 in 1971 to 575,555 in 2006, when they accounted for 7.6% of the population. Altogether, in 2006, 744,430 (10%) used mostly English as their home language, and 918,955 (12.2%) comprised the Official Language Minority, having English as their First Official language spoken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://archives.cbc.ca/IDC-1-73-1297-7470/politics_economy/bill101/clip8 |title=Five years after Bill 101 |date=March 2, 1982 | publisher=CBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; When many anglophones relocated outside of Quebec after the introduction of the Charter in the 1970s, several English-language schools in Montreal closed their doors. These school closures may also have been brought about by restrictions on who can attend English schools, which has been another ongoing drain on the English school system. Of the Anglophones between 25 and 44 years old who left the province between 1981 and 1986, 15000 individuals, which was half of this group, had university degrees. The province's unemployment rate rose from 8.7 percent in 1976 to 10.4 percent in 1977, remaining above 10 percent for 19 of the last 23 years of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.global-economics.ca/dth.chap12.htm|title=Adieu to Official Bilingualism|author=|date=|website=www.global-economics.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; The language barrier has also been regarded as a "soft cap" for population growth; for instance from 2013 to 2014 while Montreal gained around 43,000 immigrants from other parts of the world it lost 10,000 residents to other provinces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/how-does-montreal-maintain-its-enviably-low-rents/article31285810/|title=How does Montreal maintain its enviably low rents?|author=|date=|publisher=|via=The Globe and Mail}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://bennetkelley.wordpress.com/2014/07/27/quebecs-fateful-day/]&lt;/ref&gt;

Many companies, most notably [[Sun Life]], [[Royal Bank of Canada|Royal Bank]] and [[Bank of Montreal]] (which even considered removing "Montreal" from its name), moved their major operations to Toronto as a consequence of the adoption of this law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dannykucharsky.com/awards/beemo.pdf |format=PDF |title=Marketing : 'Bee-mo' and Montreal: The Bank of Montreal/BMO's complicated relationship with its hometown |date=September 2, 2002 |publisher=Dannykucharsky.com |accessdate=29 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This concerted fleeing of business and subsequent loss of thousands of jobs is sometimes said to have hindered Quebec's economy and allowed Toronto to overtake Montreal as Canada's business centre. On the other hand, Toronto's advantage had been growing since the 1930s and had become apparent in the 1950s, and is also related to the greater importance of the United States, rather than Britain, in Canada's economy. It can also be said that this movement led to a larger role for Quebec Inc.{{Clarify|date=May 2012}} in Quebec's economy.

Levying fines of up to $7000 per offence, Charter enforcers were widely labelled in the English media as the "language police" or "tongue troopers". While the ''[[Office québécois de la langue française]]'' (OQLF) provides several warnings{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} before resorting to legal sanctions, allegations that it has abused its powers has led to charges of racism and harassment.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Susan Taylor.

The 2004 annual report of the OQLF was criticized by a columnist of ''The Gazette'' who alleged that there was a "totalitarian mindset in the bureaucracy".&lt;ref&gt;Macpherson, Don. (November 25, 2004). "OQLF report borders on bigotry", ''The Gazette'' (Montreal), page A27&lt;/ref&gt; The columnist complained of sections of the report which described the continued prevalence of languages other than French in two-thirds of Montreal's households as an "alarming" trend that would present a formidable challenge to [[francophone]]s in Montreal.&lt;ref&gt;L'Office québécois de la langue française. (2004) [http://www.olf.gouv.qc.ca/office/rapports/rap20032004/rap_final_20041123.pdf Rapport annuel de gestion 2003–2004] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050324054333/http://www.olf.gouv.qc.ca/office/rapports/rap20032004/rap_final_20041123.pdf |date=March 24, 2005 }} ([[PDF]]), page 13. Retrieved November 26, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; In reality, the report judged alarming the fact that adoption of English as home language by allophones grew faster than the adoption of French as home language.&lt;ref&gt;The passage on page 13 of the report translates: "The number of persons who use French at home is therefore more important than the number of persons of French mother tongue. However, English as a home language continues to make gains in the order of 2%, while those made by French are of no more than 1.7%. These gains are all the more alarming since in 2001, English was used alone or with other languages in at least one household out of three on the Island of Montreal (35.7%), French being for its part used in two out of three households (66.6%).&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of the notwithstanding clause in the 1990s to circumvent the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]] with regards to signage also resulted in reactions from other Canadian provinces; the ''syndrome de [[Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario|Sault Ste. Marie]]'' was a series of symbolic but divisive resolutions by some municipalities outside Quebec declaring their towns unilingually English in protest of what they saw as an infringement on the rights embodied in the charter. It is often believed{{by whom|date=June 2013}} that the controversy over the Charter was what influencing the [[Meech Lake Accord]] and [[Charlottetown Accord]] to fail.
It should be noted that the Supreme Court in their ruling regarding the signs case which led to the use of the notwithstanding clause, ruled that in fact any sign law was a violation of the freedom of expression right.

Aside from the civil rights infringement, the Charter has faced legal challenges because the restricted education opportunities have hindered not only unilingual but bilingual anglophones' employment.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}} Although the Charter made French the official language of government and civil administration, the same cannot be said of the private sector. Despite nearly 30 years of the Charter, it has never been applied as rigorously as intended because to do so would violate civil liberties. English is still often made a requirement by employers in Montreal, including many French-Canadian owned ones, and, to a lesser extent, in Gatineau and Quebec City, with the workforce in Montreal remaining largely bilingual despite the Charter.

On November 14, 1988, the political and human rights [[wikt:watchdog|watchdog]] organization [[Freedom House]] published "The Doctrine of 'Preponderance of Blood' in South Africa, the Soviet Union and Quebec"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://docs.google.com/Doc?id=dg6n6657_8gfjsb8|title=Freedom House article by Tony Kondaks|author=|date=|website=google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; in its journal ''Exchange''. Introduced by [[Zbigniew Brzezinski]] (an anglophone who had once lived in Montreal) former U.S. President Jimmy Carter's National Security adviser, the essay compared the language of instruction provisions of the charter with South African apartheid statutes and jurisprudence. However, the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] disagreed with the discrimination-based-on-ancestry argument under the Quebec Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms in ''[[Gosselin (Tutor of) v. Quebec (Attorney General)]]'', believing that it conflicted with section 23 of the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]]. The criteria used by Quebec to determine if parents are entitled to have their children instructed in English are the same as those found under section 23 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/Const//page-15.html#h-47|title=Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms – Constitution Act, 1982|website=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}

==Influence abroad==
The 2001 report of the [[Estates-General on the Situation and Future of the French Language in Quebec]] identified the negative perception of Quebec's language policy in the rest of Canada and the United States as a problem to solve. It stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In Canada and abroad, the linguistic policy of Quebec is too often negatively perceived. The business community and the media in particular know it very little. For their part, the Americans remain opposed to a legislation that appears to them to reduce individual liberties and limit the use of English. For them, language and culture are two separate elements, they do not see how the protection of Quebec culture also includes the protection of the French language, even though 35 American States have adopted declarations proclaiming English the official language. Thus, must be developed the perception that Quebec culture is a part of the North-American heritage and that it is necessary to preserve it. It is also important to correct the erroneous perceptions regarding the Quebec language policy and its application.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spl.gouv.qc.ca/etatsrapport_pdf/COM1-021_Rapport_final.pdf ''Le français, une langue pour tout le monde''], report of the [[Estates-General on the Situation and Future of the French Language in Quebec]], August 20, 2001, page 184–185&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Recommendation 147 of the report suggested the creation of an institutional television and radio campaign targeting both Quebec citizens and certain groups abroad to inform on the facts of the situation of French in North America and the language policy of Quebec. Recommendation 148 suggested the creation of a watchdog to correct the errors made "both in good faith and bad faith" in the media.&lt;ref&gt;Charter of the French Language, page 186&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of the effort to correct the errors of perception, the OQLF conducted an inquiry on the influence of Quebec's language policy abroad in countries where the fragility of certain languages prompted the use of legislative measures. It requested and published the opinions of various experts from Spain, [[Israel]], the United States, [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]] and [[Lithuania]], [[Wales]], Australia and [[Flanders]] in a special issue of the OQLF's ''Revue d'aménagement linguistique'' celebrating the 25th anniversary of Quebec's Charter of the French language in 2002.

Jonas Žilinskas, lecturer at University of Šiauliai, in Lithuania described the state of the Lithuanian language after a prolonged Russian rule over his country:

&lt;blockquote&gt;One proclaimed a policy of bilingualism which was expressed only by the obligation made to Lithuanians to learn Russian while Russians did not bother to learn Lithuanian. If the written Lithuanian language were more or less protected by writers through newspapers and publishers, the spoken Lithuanian language was degraded. Often, in the institutions, it was only a language of oral communication, the greatest part of technical documentation and correspondence being written in Russian.&lt;ref name="translation"&gt;Jonas Žilinskas. "[http://www.oqlf.gouv.qc.ca/ressources/bibliotheque/ouvrages/amenagement_hs/ral01_charte_zilinkas_vf.pdf Le problème du bilinguisme en Lituanie aujourd'hui]", in ''Revue d'aménagement linguistique'', 2002 ([http://english.republiquelibre.org/The_problem_of_bilingualism_in_Lituania_today translation])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This "false bilingualism" was followed by the [[Sąjūdis]] movement during which the people of Lithuania declared their language the sole official language and began working on a language policy modeled on the experience of Quebec.&lt;ref name="translation"/&gt;

Mart Rannut, vice-dean of research at the Department of philology of the [[University of Tallinn]], in Estonia, recalled the influence of Quebec's expertise in the field of linguistic human rights and language planning which helped countries that have gained independence from the former [[Soviet Union]] and concluded that "Bill 101 indirectly touched one sixth of the planet".&lt;ref&gt;Mart Rannut. "[http://www.oqlf.gouv.qc.ca/ressources/bibliotheque/ouvrages/amenagement_hs/ral01_charte_rannut_vf.pdf Le Québec et l'Estonie]", in ''Revue d'aménagement linguistique'', 2002 ([http://english.republiquelibre.org/Quebec_and_Estonia translation])&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ina Druviete]], at the time dean of the department of sociolinguistics at the Linguistic Institute of Latvia, noted the similarities between the language policies in all three Baltic States and that of Quebec. All policies aiming "to prevent language shifts and to modify the hierarchy of languages in the public life. The principal sectors of intervention were the language used in the government agencies and the administration, in meetings and office spaces in particular, in corporate names, information and education. The principle of territorial linguistic rights was instituted."&lt;ref&gt;Ina Druviete. "[http://www.oqlf.gouv.qc.ca/ressources/bibliotheque/ouvrages/amenagement_hs/ral01_charte_druviete_vf.pdf La Charte de la langue française et les lois linguistiques dans les Pays baltes]", in ''Revue d'aménagement linguistique'', 2002 ([http://english.republiquelibre.org/The_Charter_of_the_French_language_in_the_Baltic_States translation])&lt;/ref&gt;

In Wales, the language policy of Quebec had a great influence, but could not be implemented as it was in the Baltic States because Welsh speakers do not form a majority in this constituent country of the United Kingdom. According to [[Colin H. Williams]], professor and researcher at the Welsh Department of [[Cardiff University]] particular lessons followed in Wales which stem from the experience of Quebec are:

* The acquisition of detailed census data and explanatory facts aiming at clarifying the public discussion 
* The linguistic legislation (official language status, right to speak Welsh before the court, [[Welsh Language Board]] responsible to administer the law) 
* The iconography of the linguistic landscape
* The progress in the teaching of the Welsh language&lt;ref&gt;[[Colin H. Williams]]. "[http://www.oqlf.gouv.qc.ca/ressources/bibliotheque/ouvrages/amenagement_hs/ral01_charte_williams_vf.pdf L'influence de l'aménagement linguistique au Québec au-delà de ses frontières : Le Pays de Galles]", in ''Revue d'aménagement linguistique'', 2002 ([http://english.republiquelibre.org/The_influence_of_Quebec%27s_language_planning_policy_abroad:_Wales translation])&lt;/ref&gt;

In Israel, while the "penetration of English in the sociolinguistic organization of the country" is perceived, according to [[Bernard Spolsky]], professor emeritus of English at the [[Bar-Ilan University]], as a threat to Hebrew, the language policy has thus far only influenced linguists and some politicians. He writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Periodically, Israeli politicians present bills to proclaim Hebrew the sole official language of the country. Presently, Hebrew shares this title with Arabic only, because a measure was taken soon after the foundation of the State, in 1948, to modify the British policy, which imposed three languages, and gave up English. The last attempt at giving a judicial protection to Hebrew goes back to December 2000: two bills were then rejected.&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Spolsky. "[http://www.oqlf.gouv.qc.ca/ressources/bibliotheque/ouvrages/amenagement_hs/ral01_charte_spolsky_vf.pdf L’aménagement linguistique au Québec : regard d'un Israélien]", in ''Revue d'aménagement linguistique'', 2002 ([http://english.republiquelibre.org/Quebec%27s_language_planning_policy:_Israeli_perspective translation])&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In Catalonia, according to Miquel Reniu i Tresserras, president of the ''Comissió de Lectorats'' and former chief executive officer of the Catalan language policy, Quebec's legislation has constituted a "reference model" and the OQLF and the equivalent body in Catalonia are in close collaboration.&lt;ref&gt;Miquel Reniu i Tresserras.

The Court held that a [[plaintiff]] cannot recover from a defendant based on [[implied warranty]] when she does not have contractual [[privity of contract|privity]] with him;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=John S. Allee |author2=Theodore V. H. Mayer |author3=Robb W. Patryk |title=Product Liability|publisher=Law Journal Press|year=1984|pages=550|chapter=§1.03 Warranty and Strict Liability|isbn=978-1-58852-026-5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Kc4-BlWh_BoC&amp;pg=PP45&amp;lpg=PP45&amp;dq=%22139+N.E.+576%22}}&lt;/ref&gt; thus, a plaintiff cannot recover from a defendant who sold her employer food unfit for consumption, because the defendant's implied warranty extended only to the employer.

Chysky is part of a progression of cases that influenced the products liability synthesis that emerged early in the century.  The Chysky case reflects a refinement of Judge [[Benjamin N. Cardozo|Cardozo]]'s argument in ''[[MacPherson v Buick Motor Co.]]'' that a person could be liable for a defective product to someone other than the immediate purchaser.  In Chysky, Cardozo joined Judge McLaughlin's opinion, which relied on Cardozo's statement in MacPherson that the basis of liability in that case was in [[tort]], not [[contract]]. "If the exceptions expressed in MacPherson had been a smokescreen for the basic principle that a producer of a defective product would be liable to anyone who might be expected to use it, Cardozo would have applied the MacPherson principles to permit the waitress to recover regardless of her choice not to sue in tort. Yet Cardozo joined the majority that ruled against the waitress, not Judge Hogan's silent dissent."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nelson|first=William E.|date=Winter 1999|title=Benjamin Cardozo as Paradigmatic Tort Lawmaker|journal=Buffalo Law Review|volume=47 Buff. L. Rev. 117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Brief of case==

===Facts===
Plaintiff's employer gave her a piece of cake that had been made and sold to him by the defendant.  There was a nail in a cake that struck her gum, causing it to be infected to the extent that three teeth needed to be removed.

Plaintiff sued the person who sold the cake to her employer, upon the theory that he was liable to her since he had implicitly warranted (when he sold the cake to her employer) that it was fit for human consumption.

===Issue===
Does the provision of the [[Uniform Sales Act]] §15(1) that provides,

:“there is no implied warranty or condition as to the quality or fitness for any particular purpose of goods supplied under a contract to sell or a sale, except as follows: 1. Where the BUYER expressly or by implication makes known to the seller the particular purpose for which the goods are required, and it appears that the BUYER relies on the seller’s skill or judgment (whether he be the grower or manufacturer or not), there is an [[implied warranty]] that the goods shall be reasonably fit for such purpose”

include a third party who does not have [[privity of contract]] with the seller if no [[negligence]] is implied?

===Holding===
No, said the Court of Appeals. The provision does not include a third party who does not have privity of contract with the seller if no negligence is implied.  If there is no [[privity of contract]] between third persons and the seller of food, there can be no implied warranty.  The benefit of warranty (either express or implied) does not run with the chattel on its resale (and thus is unlike a covenant running with land, which does give a subsequent purchaser a right of action on a warranty).

===Reasoning===
The Court of appeals reasoned:
*In ''[[Rinaldi v. Mohican Co.]]'', the cause of action arose after the section of the Personal Property Law quoted took effect. Court held that “the mere purchase by a customer from a retail dealer in foods of an article ordinarily used for human consumption does by implication make known to the vendor the purpose for which the article is used.”
*In the case at hand, the plaintiff received the cake from her employer, who bought the cake from the defendant. Defendant is not liable to the plaintiff for her injuries because there was no contract between her and the defendant. The general rule is that a manufacturer or seller of food or other articles of personal property is not liable to third persons under an implied warranty. If there is no privity of contract, there is no implied warranty.

==Notes==
The plaintiff could have sued in tort rather than in contract (implied warranty), but plaintiff limited her right to recover to a breach of warranty. This indicates the continued relevance of privity in employment cases.

'''Civil forfeiture in the United States''', also called '''civil asset forfeiture''' or '''civil judicial forfeiture'''&lt;ref name="twsDeptOfJustice"/&gt; or occasionally '''civil seizure''', is a [[legal process]] in which [[law enforcement officer]]s take [[asset]]s from persons suspected of involvement with crime or illegal activity without necessarily charging the owners with wrongdoing. While [[civil procedure]], as opposed to [[criminal procedure]], generally involves a dispute between two private citizens, civil forfeiture involves a dispute between [[law enforcement]] and ''property'' such as a pile of cash or a house or a boat, such that the thing is suspected of being involved in a crime. To get back the seized property, owners must prove it was not involved in criminal activity. Sometimes it can mean a threat to seize property as well as the act of seizure itself.&lt;ref name="twsBostonGlobe"/&gt; 

Proponents see civil forfeiture as a powerful tool to thwart criminal organizations involved in the [[illegal drug trade]], with $12 billion annual profits,&lt;ref name="twsNPR3"/&gt; since it allows authorities to seize cash and other assets, from narcotics trafficking. They also argue that it is an efficient method since it allows [[law enforcement agencies]] to use these seized proceeds to further battle illegal activity, that is, directly converting value obtained from illegal items for law enforcement purposes by harming criminals economically while helping law enforcement financially. Critics argue that [[innocent owner]]s can become entangled in the process to the extent that their [[right to property]] is violated, with few legal protections and [[due process]] rules to protect them in situations where they are presumed guilty instead of being [[presumption of innocence|presumed innocent]]. Further, critics argue that the incentives lead to corruption and law enforcement misbehavior. There is consensus that [[abuse]]s have happened but disagreement about their extent as well as whether the overall benefits to society are worth the cost of the instances of abuse.

==History==

===Legal origins===
[[File:A British Man of War before the Rock of Gibraltar by Thomas Whitcombe.jpg|thumb|Civil forfeiture laws have been traced back to the [[Navigation Acts|British Navigation Acts]], which allowed seizure of ships and goods on suspicion of wrongdoing.]]

{{Quote|The idea of going at people through their property has a long history. The theories are quite old. The prevalence of the practice is comparatively recent.|Daniel C. Richman, [[Fordham Law School]], 1999&lt;ref name="twsNYT432"/&gt;}}

Civil forfeiture has a history dating back several hundred years with roots in British maritime law to the [[Navigation Acts|British Navigation Acts]] around the middle 1600s. These laws required ships importing or exporting goods from British ports to fly the British flag; ships that failed to do this could be seized regardless of whether the ship's owner was guilty of doing any wrongdoing.&lt;ref name="twsForbes1"/&gt; It was easier to seize a vessel than try to apprehend an owner on the other side of the ocean,&lt;ref name="twsNewYorker1"/&gt; as explained by Supreme Court justice [[Joseph Story]]:

{{Quote|...&amp;nbsp;(A) vessel which commits the aggression is treated as the offender, as the guilty instrument or thing to which the forfeiture attaches, without any reference whatsoever to the character or conduct of the owner. (The seizure of the ship is justified by&amp;nbsp;...) the necessity of the case, as the only adequate means of suppressing the offense or wrong, or insuring an indemnity to the injured party.|[[Joseph Story]]&lt;ref name="twsForbes1"/&gt;}}

During the later Colonial years, forfeiture practices by the Crown officials using [[writ of assistance|writs of assistance]] were one of the many activities that angered colonists, who saw the writs as "unreasonable searches and seizures" that deprived persons of "life, liberty, or property, without due process".&lt;ref name="twsNewYorker1"/&gt; The early [[United States Congress|Congress]] wrote forfeiture laws based on British maritime law to help federal tax collectors collect customs duties, which financed most of the expenses of the federal government in the early days of the republic.&lt;ref name="twsForbes1"/&gt; Seizures allowed government to confiscate property from citizens who failed to pay taxes or customs duties.&lt;ref name="twsNYT432"/&gt; The Supreme Court upheld these forfeiture statutes in situations where it was virtually impossible to get hold of guilty persons on the high seas while possible to get hold of their property.&lt;ref name="twsForbes1"/&gt; During much of the 19th century there was not much attention paid to forfeiture laws.&lt;ref name="twsForbes1"/&gt;

===Prohibition era===
[[File:Detroit police inspecting equipment found in a clandestine underground brewery during the prohibition era - NARA - 541928.jpg|thumb|During [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]], [[Detroit police]] inspect equipment suspected of being used to make alcohol; under civil forfeiture laws, police could seize the equipment without having to charge any owners with a crime.]]

Government used forfeiture during the [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]] years 1920–1933.&lt;ref name="twsForbes1"/&gt; Police seized vehicles and equipment and cash and other property from [[rum-running|bootleggers]].&lt;ref name="twsNYT432"/&gt; When Prohibition ended in 1933, much of the forfeiture activity ended as well, and modern forfeiture was an "infrequent resort" until the last few decades.&lt;ref name="twsNewYorker1"/&gt;

===War on Drugs (1980–present)===
Civil forfeiture activity increased substantially in the past thirty years.&lt;ref name="twsWashPost3"/&gt; It stepped up forfeiture during the [[War on Drugs]] during the early 1980s and onwards.&lt;ref name="twsForbes1"/&gt; It became harder for criminal organizations to launder dirty money by means of the financial system, so drug cartels preferred bulk payments of cash.&lt;ref name="twsNPR23"/&gt; Illegal drugs are a big business; one estimate was that the annual profit from selling illegal drugs was $12 billion, according to the [[United States Drug Enforcement Administration]].&lt;ref name="twsForbes1"/&gt; The initial intent, similar to methods used to try to fight alcohol trafficking and use during the Prohibition era, was to use civil forfeitures as a weapon against drug kingpins.&lt;ref name="twsWSJ1"/&gt;

According to journalist [[Sarah Stillman]], a major turning point in forfeiture activity was the passage of the [[Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984]].&lt;ref name="twsLATimes12"/&gt; This law permitted local and federal law enforcement agencies to divvy up the seized assets and cash.&lt;ref name="twsNewYorker1"/&gt; Civil forfeiture allowed federal and local governments to "extract swift penalties from white-collar criminals and offer restitution to victims of fraud", according to Stillman.&lt;ref name="twsNewYorker1"/&gt; From 1985 to 1993, authorities confiscated $3 billion of cash and other property based on the federal ''Asset Forfeiture Program'', which included both civil and criminal forfeitures.&lt;ref name="twsLATimes12"/&gt; The methods were supported by the Reagan administration as a crime fighting strategy.

{{Quote|It's now possible for a drug dealer to serve time in a forfeiture-financed prison after being arrested by agents driving a forfeiture-provided automobile while working in a forfeiture-funded sting operation.|[[Presidency of Ronald Reagan|Reagan]] attorney general [[Dick Thornburgh|Richard Thornburgh]] in 1989.&lt;ref name="twsNewYorker1"/&gt;}}

The politics of civil forfeiture were somewhat unusual. The federal forfeiture laws were introduced and pushed through by Republicans in the 1980s, with support from some Democrats; but efforts to reform forfeiture laws have also come from the right,&lt;ref name="twsWashPost2"/&gt; as libertarians in Congress have focused on the basic idea as offensive to property rights.&lt;ref name="twsWashPost2"/&gt; In many areas civil forfeiture adversely affects persons from minorities and low-income communities, in which the typical seizure is less than $500, and Democrats have also been critical of civil forfeiture programs.&lt;ref name="twsWashPost2"/&gt; The ACLU has also been a long time opponent.&lt;ref name="twsWashPost2"/&gt;

Forfeiture was used for purposes other than trying to discourage illegal drug activity, such as attempts in New York City to discourage [[DUI|drunk driving]]. Forfeiture rules were used to confiscate cars of intoxicated motorists.&lt;ref name="twsNYT432"/&gt; In such instances, there are two types of cases: a criminal case against the drunk driver as a ''person'', and a civil case against the ''property'' used to facilitate the drunk driving, specifically their car.&lt;ref name="twsNYT432"/&gt; Critics contend that the punishment can be "deemed out of proportion with the offense"; for example, after a drunk driver is arrested and convicted and possibly imprisoned, is it proper to punish him or her additionally by civil forfeiture means by confiscating a $50,000 car?&lt;ref name="twsNYT432"/&gt; Civil forfeiture has been used to discourage illegal activities such as [[cockfight]]ing, [[drag racing]], [[gambling in the United States|gambling]] in basements, [[poaching]] of endangered fish, [[securities fraud]], and other illegal activity.&lt;ref name="twsNewYorker1"/&gt;

[[File:Payouts to states in USA by Federal Govt under Equitable Sharing Program.png|thumb|A chart showing that payouts are growing, according to the [[equitable sharing]] arrangement. Source: United States Justice and Treasury Departments.]]
Courts helped set up the legal framework to help law enforcement stem the drug tide while sometimes trying to rein in abuses. A 1984 law set up the [[equitable sharing]] arrangement in which state and local police can share the seizures with federal agents.&lt;ref name="twsWSJ5"/&gt; While the 1993 Supreme Court case ''[[Austin v. United States]]'' ruled that a forfeiture could be considered as an excessive fine,&lt;ref name="twsNYTimes17"/&gt; the court upheld the principle of civil forfeiture generally.&lt;ref name="twsForbes1"/&gt; A 1996 Supreme Court decision ruled that prosecuting a person for a crime and seizing his or her property via civil forfeiture did not constitute [[double jeopardy]], and therefore did not violate the Constitution.&lt;ref name="twsNYTimes17"/&gt; However, in 1999, the Supreme Court ruled that civil forfeiture was not permitted if the amount seized was "grossly disproportional" to the gravity of the offense.&lt;ref name="twsNYT432"/&gt;

Legislatures played a role as well. Since the 1990s, the number of federal statutes permitting government forfeiture doubled from 200 to 400.&lt;ref name="twsWSJ5"/&gt; In 2000, lawmakers passed the ''Civil Asset Forfeiture Reform Act'', or ''CAFRA'', which stipulated protections for individuals and increased the level of proof required.&lt;ref name="twsWSJ5"/&gt; Critics said that the new guidelines did not require poor persons to have free access to legal services.&lt;ref name="twsWSJ5"/&gt; CAFRA guidelines suggest that if a claimant wins a civil-forfeiture case, that some of the legal fees paid to recover the property are partially payable by the government.&lt;ref name="twsWSJ5"/&gt; CAFRA was supposed to raise government's burden of proof before seizing property.&lt;ref name="twsNPR1"/&gt; CAFRA meant if government loses a forfeiture challenge, government must pay the victim's attorney costs, but often victims are unaware of this fact, so they fail to hire lawyers thinking the cost will be prohibitive.&lt;ref name="twsNPR1"/&gt;

Police forces heeded instruction from a law enforcement consultant named Joe David who had an "uncanny talent for finding cocaine and cash in cars and trucks", according to one report.&lt;ref name="twsWashPost13"/&gt; Officers trained in David's so-called ''Desert Snow'' stop-and-seizure techniques raked in $427 million from highway encounters during a five-year period.&lt;ref name="twsWashPost13"/&gt; A contract allowed David's consulting firm to keep 25% of the seized cash.&lt;ref name="twsWashPost13"/&gt;

But when [[innocent owner]]s were sometimes ensnarled in seizure proceedings, it spurred criticism. In the early 1990s, San Francisco-based defense attorney Brenda Grantland organized a group called [[Forfeiture Endangers American Rights]] (which spells the letters ''FEAR''), with branches in [[New Jersey]], [[Virginia]], [[California]], and [[Massachusetts]].&lt;ref name="twsLATimes12"/&gt; Debate about reforming civil forfeiture procedures happened in the late 1990s but after [[public scrutiny]] died down, lawmakers quietly relaxed the reforms at the behest of police groups and prosecutors without much public debate.&lt;ref name="twsWashPost3"/&gt;

Civil forfeiture was used successfully on many occasions. For example, it was used to seize assets by corrupt foreigners, such as against [[Teodoro Nguema Obiang Mangue]], who stole money from the African nation of [[Equatorial Guinea]] and was convicted.&lt;ref name="twsMiamiHerald"/&gt; Overall, the pattern in recent decades has been a substantial increase in forfeiture activity. According to government records, Justice department seizures went from $27 million in 1985 to $556 million in 1993 and $4.2 billion in 2012.&lt;ref name="twsNewYorker1"/&gt;

In 2015, [[Eric Holder]] ended the policy of "adoptive forfeiture", which occurred "when a state or local law enforcement agency seizes property pursuant to state law and requests that a federal agency take the seized asset and forfeit it under federal law" due to abuse.&lt;ref&gt;Office of Public Affairs, January 15, 2017, The Justice Department, [https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/attorney-general-prohibits-federal-agency-adoptions-assets-seized-state-and-local-law Attorney General Prohibits Federal Agency Adoptions of Assets Seized by State and Local Law Enforcement Agencies], Retrieved July 22, 2017, "Attorney General Prohibits Federal Agency Adoptions of Assets Seized by State and Local Law Enforcement Agencies"&lt;/ref&gt; Although states proceeded to curtail the powers of police to seize assets, actions by the [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] in July 2017 have sought to reinstate police seizure powers that simultaneously raise funding for federal agencies and local law enforcement.&lt;ref name=twsWashPost8989&gt;Christopher Ingraham, July 19, 2017, ''The Washington Post'', [https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/07/19/jeff-sessions-justice-department-turns-a-65-million-asset-forfeiture-spigot-back-on/?wpisrc=nl_evening&amp;wpm=1 "Jeff Sessions's Justice Department turns a $65 million asset forfeiture spigot back on"], Retrieved July 19, 2017, "... But the changes announced today turn that cash spigot back on ... more law enforcement agencies now have the incentive to sidestep those reforms via the reinstated adoptive forfeiture process...."&lt;/ref&gt;

Civil procedure cases generally involve disputes between two private citizens, often about money or property, while criminal procedure involves a dispute between a private citizen and the state, usually because a law has been broken. In legal systems based on [[British law]] such as that of the [[United States]], civil and criminal law cases are [[civil procedure#Differences between civil and criminal procedure|handled differently]], with different tests and standards and procedures, and this is true of forfeiture proceedings as well. Both civil and criminal forfeiture involve the taking of assets by police.

In civil forfeiture, assets are seized by police based on a suspicion of wrongdoing, and without having to charge a person with specific wrongdoing, with the case being between police and the ''thing itself'', sometimes referred to by the Latin term ''[[in rem jurisdiction|in rem]]'', meaning "against the property"; the property itself is the defendant and no criminal charge against the owner is needed.&lt;ref name="twsDeptOfJustice"/&gt;

In contrast, criminal forfeiture is a legal action brought as "part of the criminal prosecution of a defendant", described by the Latin term ''[[in personam]]'', meaning "against the person", and happens when government indicts or charges the property that is either used in connection with a crime, or derived from a crime, that is suspected of being committed by the defendant;&lt;ref name="twsDeptOfJustice"/&gt; the seized assets are temporarily held and become government property officially ''after'' an accused person has been convicted by a court of law; if the person is found to be not guilty, the seized property must be returned.

The tests to establish the [[legal burden of proof|burden of proof]] are different;&lt;ref name="twsWSJ5"/&gt; in civil forfeiture, the test in most cases&lt;ref&gt;Note: the legal tests used to justify civil forfeiture vary according to state law, but in most cases the tests are looser than in criminal trials where the "beyond a reasonable doubt" test is predominant&lt;/ref&gt; is whether police feel there is a [[legal burden of proof#Preponderance of the evidence|preponderance of the evidence]] suggesting wrongdoing; in criminal forfeiture, the test is whether police feel the evidence is [[reasonable doubt|beyond a reasonable doubt]], which is a tougher test to meet.&lt;ref name="twsNPR3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="twsWSJ5"/&gt;

If property is seized in a civil forfeiture, it is "up to the owner to prove that his cash is clean".&lt;ref name="twsNPR3"/&gt; Normally both civil and criminal forfeiture require involvement by the judiciary; however, there is a variant of civil forfeiture called ''administrative forfeiture'', which is essentially a civil forfeiture that does not require involvement by the judiciary, which derives its powers from the [[Smoot–Hawley Tariff Act|Tariff Act of 1930]], and empowers police to seize banned imported merchandise, as well as things used to import or transport or store a controlled substance, money, or other property that is less than $500,000 value.&lt;ref name="twsDeptOfJustice"/&gt;

===Justification===
[[File:Oblique facade 3, US Supreme Court.jpg|thumb|The [[SCOTUS|Supreme Court]] has generally upheld the principle of civil forfeiture.]]
According to the [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]], there are three main justifications for civil forfeitures:
#'''Punishment and deterrence'''. To punish and deter criminal activity by depriving criminals of property used or acquired through illegal activities.&lt;ref name="twsDeptOfJustice2"/&gt;
#'''Enhance police cooperation'''. To enhance cooperation among foreign, federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies, through the equitable sharing of assets recovered through this program.&lt;ref name="twsDeptOfJustice2"/&gt;
#'''Revenue for law enforcement'''. As a byproduct, to produce revenues to enhance forfeitures and strengthen law enforcement.&lt;ref name="twsDeptOfJustice2"/&gt;

Since police can charge a person with a crime in a criminal case and charge his or her things in a civil case, issues such as [[double jeopardy]] have been raised. Further, there has been debate about whether seizures of property are considered as a fine or as a punishment in a legal sense. The distinction was clarified by the Supreme Court in ''[[United States v. Bajakajian]]'', which decreed that a criminal forfeiture could be considered as both a type of fine and a punishment, while a civil forfeiture was not intended as a punishment of a person but rather a "legal fiction of punishing the property".&lt;ref name="twsNYT15"/&gt; As a result, the court decreed that civil forfeitures that served as [[Legal remedy|remedial]] were not considered as a type of fine.&lt;ref name="twsNYT15"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1998/06/23/us/supreme-court-roundup-justices-narrow-the-uses-of-forfeiture.html | title = Supreme Court Roundup; Justices Narrow the Uses of Forfeiture | first=  Linda | last = Greenhouse | date = June 23, 1998 | accessdate = November 23, 2018 |work [[The New York Times]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally the [[SCOTUS|United States Supreme Court]] has upheld the principle of civil asset forfeiture at the federal level.&lt;ref name="twsWashPost3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="twsNYT14"/&gt; The Court ruled in ''[[Austin v. United States]]'' (1993) that such civil forfeiture, treated as punitive actions, are subject to the Excessive Fines clause of the Eighth Amendment, though whether this is [[Incorporation of the Bill of Rights|incorporated to state and local]] civil forfeitures is a question asked in the pending case, ''[[Timbs v. Indiana]]'' (2018).&lt;ref name="nytimes timbs"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/25/us/politics/supreme-court-civil-asset-forfeiture.html | title = He Sold Drugs for $225. Indiana Took His $42,000 Land Rover. | first = Adam | last = Liptak | date = June 25, 2018 | accessdate = November 21, 2018 | work = [[The New York Times]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, there are more than 400 federal statutes that empower police to take assets from convicted criminals, as well as from persons not charged with criminality.&lt;ref name="twsWSJ5"/&gt; Sometimes the seizures happen as a result of different government agencies working together, such as the [[United States Internal Revenue Service|Internal Revenue Service]] and the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]].&lt;ref name="twsUSAToday1"/&gt; Police at national and state levels cooperate in many instances according to procedural laws known as [[equitable sharing]]. In addition, there are laws that make it difficult for criminals to get [[dirty money]] clean by methods of [[money laundering]]; for example, law requires that cash deposits greater than $10,000 to a bank account be reported by the bank to the federal government,&lt;ref name="twsWashingtonPost1"/&gt; and there have been instances in which repeated cash deposits under this amount have looked suspicious to authorities even though they were done legitimately, leading to civil forfeiture seizures directly from a bank account. What has caused controversy is when the property of innocent persons is seized by police who believe that the seized items were involved in criminal activity.

===Prevalence===
Although there are accessible statistics of seizures at the federal level, it often happens that the totals of forfeitures from both criminals and innocent owners are combined; for example, one report was that in 2010, government seized $2.5 billion in assets from criminals and innocent owners by forfeiture methods,&lt;ref name="twsWSJ5"/&gt; and the totals of assets seized incorrectly from innocent owners was not separated statistically. Further, since the United States is a [[federalism|federal republic]] with governments at both the national and state level, there are civil forfeiture seizures at the state level, which are not tracked and recorded in any central database,&lt;ref name="twsNPR23"/&gt; which make it difficult to make assessments, since state laws and procedures vary widely. According to ''[[The Washington Post]]'', federal asset forfeiture in 2014 accounted for over $5 billion going into Justice and Treasury Department coffers, while in comparison, official statistics show that the amount stolen from citizens by burglars during that same year was a mere $3.5 billion.&lt;ref name=twsWashPost7&gt;Christopher Ingraham November 23, 2015, ''The Washington Post'', [https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/11/23/cops-took-more-stuff-from-people-than-burglars-did-last-year/ Law enforcement took more stuff from people than burglars did last year], Retrieved November 24, 2015, "...&amp;nbsp;In 2014, for the first time ever, law enforcement officers took more property from American citizens than burglars did.&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods==
Civil forfeiture begins when government suspects that a property is connected with illegal drug activity, and files a civil action:&lt;ref name="twsDeptOfJustice2"/&gt;

{{Quote|The government simply files a civil action ''in rem'' against the property itself, and then generally must prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the property is forfeitable under the applicable forfeiture statute. Civil forfeiture is independent of any criminal case, and because of this, the forfeiture action may be filed before indictment, after indictment, or even if there is no indictment. Likewise, civil forfeiture may be sought in cases in which the owner is criminally acquitted of the underlying crimes&amp;nbsp;...|Craig Gaumer, Assistant United States Attorney, 2007&lt;ref name="twsDeptOfJustice2"/&gt;}}

Properties that can be confiscated include real estate property such as a house or motel, cars, cash, jewelry, boats, and almost anything&lt;ref name="twsWSJ5"/&gt; suspected of being related to the manufacture and sale and transportation of illegal controlled substances, such as:

#controlled substances&lt;ref name="twsDeptOfJustice2"/&gt;
#raw materials needed to make them&lt;ref name="twsDeptOfJustice2"/&gt;
#containers to hold them&lt;ref name="twsDeptOfJustice2"/&gt;
#vehicles to transport them&lt;ref name="twsDeptOfJustice2"/&gt;
#information for manufacture and distribution, such as books, records, and formulas&lt;ref name="twsDeptOfJustice2"/&gt;
#money and other valuables "used or intended to be used" to buy or sell them&lt;ref name="twsDeptOfJustice2"/&gt;
#property facilitating illegal transactions&lt;ref name="twsDeptOfJustice2"/&gt;
#chemicals needed to make them&lt;ref name="twsDeptOfJustice2"/&gt;
#machines for making capsules and tablets&lt;ref name="twsDeptOfJustice2"/&gt;
#drug paraphernalia&lt;ref name="twsDeptOfJustice2"/&gt;
#firearms&lt;ref name="twsDeptOfJustice2"/&gt;

===Traffic stops===
[[File:Police traffic stop Millington TN 2013-11-24 001.jpg|thumb|A motorist stopped by police in Tennessee.]]
[[File:Civil forfeiture case US District Court Nebraska 2.png|thumb|In a civil forfeiture case in the United States, the state is the [[plaintiff]] and a thing is the defendant—in this case, the thing is $25,180 cash that was seized by police under suspicion of being involved in [[illegal activity]]. In legal terms, it is an ''in rem'' case (against a thing) as opposed to an ''[[in personam]]'' case (against a person). Here is the docket for a real case that happened after police seized money.]]
[[File:Deposits to US Dept of Justice from Seizures of Cash and Cash Equivalents.png|thumb|From 2006 to 2008, currency deposits alone exceeded [[$1 billion]] for each year. Source: the [[Institute for Justice]]&lt;ref name=twsPol4Profit/&gt;]]

One method of intercepting funds is by [[traffic stop|highway interdictions]], typically along highway routes suspected to be used regularly by drug smugglers, often between Mexico and the United States.

News media have reported many examples:
* Mandrel Stuart was not charged with a crime and there was no evidence of illegal activity but police seized his money because they assumed it was drug-related:&lt;ref name="twsWashPost4"/&gt; {{Quote|Mandrel Stuart and his girlfriend were on a date driving on Interstate 66&amp;nbsp;... The traffic stop on that balmy afternoon in August 2012 was the beginning of a dizzying encounter that would leave Stuart shaken and wondering whether he had been singled out because he was black and had a police record. Over the next two hours, he would be detained without charges, handcuffed and taken to a nearby police station&amp;nbsp;... stripped of $17,550 in cash&amp;nbsp;... earned through&amp;nbsp;... a small barbecue restaurant&amp;nbsp;... he was going to use the money that night for supplies and equipment.|report in ''[[The Washington Post]]'', 2014&lt;ref name="twsWashPost4"/&gt;}}
*Javier Gonzalez was carrying $10,000 cash in a briefcase and got pulled over in Texas; deputies handed Gonzalez a waiver, that if he signed over the money and did not claim it later, he would not be arrested, but if he refused to sign the waiver, Gonzalez would be arrested for money-laundering.&lt;ref name="twsNPR1"/&gt; Gonzalez signed the waiver wondering if the officers were real "officers of law" and wondering if he got robbed, but later sued the county, which lost, and returned his cash plus paid him $110,000 in damages plus attorney's fees.&lt;ref name="twsNPR1"/&gt;
*Matt Lee of [[Clare, Michigan]], was driving to [[California]] with $2,500 cash when pulled over by police in [[Nevada]], who seized almost all of the cash under suspicion that it was a "drug run"; Lee hired an attorney who took half as his fee, leaving Lee with only $1130 remaining.&lt;ref name="twsWashPost4"/&gt; {{Quote|I just couldn't believe that police could do that to anyone&amp;nbsp;... It's like they are at war with innocent people.|Matt Lee, interviewed in ''[[The Washington Post]]'', 2013&lt;ref name="twsWashPost4"/&gt;}}
*Tan Nguyen. In 2008, a federal judge ordered $50,000 returned to a man after police seized the money during a traffic stop in [[Nebraska]], after reviewing a recording of the seizure in which a sheriff's deputy suggested that we "take his money and, um, count it as a drug seizure".&lt;ref name="twsWSJ5"/&gt; Tan Nguyen's $50,000 was confiscated by police during a traffic stop, and the county agreed to return the funds after a legal challenge.&lt;ref name="twsWSJ8"/&gt;
*In May 2010 a couple was driving from New York to Florida and they were stopped by police because of a cracked windshield.&lt;ref name="twsWashPost4"/&gt; During questioning, the officer decided that $32,000 cash in the van was "probably involved in criminal or drug-related activity", seized it, shared it with federal authorities under [[equitable sharing]].&lt;ref name="twsWashPost4"/&gt; The victim hired a lawyer to get back the seized money who urged settling for half of the seized amount, and after the lawyer's fees, the victim got back only $7,000.&lt;ref name="twsWashPost4"/&gt;
*A 2013 ''[[The New Yorker]]'' piece detailed abuses in [[Tenaha, Texas]], where police would target out-of-state drivers using [[rental cars]], often not issuing traffic tickets, and disproportionately pulling over [[African American]]s and [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Latino-Americans]].&lt;ref name="twsNewYorker1"/&gt; Police sometimes ask stopped motorists to sign "roadside property waivers", which, unless signed, threaten criminal charges unless valuables are handed over; the waivers say, in effect, that victims will not contest the seizure in exchange for not being arrested.&lt;ref name="twsNewYorker1"/&gt;

If a passing motorist does not sign a waiver and it becomes recorded as a legal case, the case names are often unusual.&lt;ref name="twsNewYorker1"/&gt; In a civil forfeiture case, the [[in rem jurisdiction|asset itself is listed as the "defendant"]].&lt;ref name="twsWSJ5"/&gt; For example, one case was titled ''State of Texas v. One Gold Crucifix'', based on a traffic stop in which a woman was pulled over, no charges were filed, but this item of jewelry was seized.&lt;ref name="twsNewYorker1"/&gt; Another case name was ''United States v. $35,651.11 in U.S. Currency''.&lt;ref name="twsWashingtonPost1"/&gt;

''[[The Washington Post]]'' analyzed 400 seizures in 17 states that were examples of [[equitable sharing]] arrangements.&lt;ref name="twsWashPost4"/&gt; Police stop motorists under the [[pretext]] of a minor traffic infraction, and "analyze" the intentions of motorists by assessing nervousness, and request permission to search the vehicle without a warrant; however, of the 400 seizures studied by ''The Washington Post'', police did not make any arrests.&lt;ref name="twsWashPost4"/&gt;

===Other cash seizures===
Cash has been seized in peculiar circumstances. For example, New York businessman James Lieto's $392,000 in cash was seized by federal authorities, since his legitimate funds mixed up with illegal funds in an armored car that was seized by an FBI probe.&lt;ref name="twsWSJ5"/&gt; Lieto had to wait until the government's criminal case was finished before he could get his money back, which took considerable time, and caused considerable financial hardship and stress.&lt;ref name="twsWSJ5"/&gt;

Police have broken into homes. In March 2012, in the middle of the night, without a warrant, New York City police burst into the home of Gerald Bryan, ransacked his belongings, ripped out light fixtures, arrested him, and seized $4,800 of his cash, but after a year, the case against him was dropped.&lt;ref name="twsWashPost3"/&gt; When Bryan tried to get back his money, he was told it was "too late" since the money had already been put into the police pension fund.&lt;ref name="twsWashPost3"/&gt; Victims of forfeiture often find themselves faced with fighting in a "labyrinthine" procedure to get their money back.&lt;ref name="twsWashPost3"/&gt;

In May, 2013, IRS agents seized $32,821 from the account of a restaurant owner in [[Arnolds Park, Iowa]], on suspicion of [[tax evasion]],&lt;ref&gt;Note: when there are numerous cash deposits, each below the $10,000 threshold for reporting requirements, it is sometimes called [[structuring]] and is a federal crime, as well as being a method often used to conceal illegal activity.&lt;/ref&gt; but the seizure was contested by lawyers from the Institute for Justice.&lt;ref name=twsDickinsonCtyNews/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Finney, ''The Des Moines Register'', November 2, 2014, [http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/crime-and-courts/2014/11/02/civil-forfeiture-iowa-carole-hinders-arnolds-park/18362299/ Forfeiture target calls it 'a violation of civil rights'], Retrieved April 3, 2015, "... May 2013 when two Internal Revenue Service agents knocked on the door of her Spirit Lake home&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|The IRS is increasingly taking money from legitimate businesspeople who&amp;nbsp;... run an honest cash business and make frequent cash deposits&amp;nbsp;... The government doesn't allege that she evaded taxes. The government doesn't allege that she was depositing money from an illicit source. She's simply depositing her own lawfully-earned money&amp;nbsp;... that she gets from customers in her restaurant&amp;nbsp;...|[[Institute for Justice]] attorney Larry Salzman, 2014&lt;ref name=twsDickinsonCtyNews&gt;November 4, 2014, Russ Mitchell, Dickinson County News, [http://www.dickinsoncountynews.com/story/2134827.html May 2015 date likely to settle Mrs. Lady's case], Retrieved April 3, 2015, "...&amp;nbsp;accounts are often seized without any real investigation. Agents simply looked at her bank deposits and saw frequent bank deposits of less than $10,000.&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Seizures of real estate===
[[File:Motel Caswell, Wamesit MA.jpg|thumb|Prosecutors threatened to seize a motel, similar to this one owned by the Caswell family, when there was illegal drug use on the premises in [[Wamesit, Massachusetts]]]]

Police can seize not only cash from cars but [[real estate]] such as a person's home. For example, homes have been seized even if someone other than the homeowner on the premises committed drug crimes without the owner's awareness.&lt;ref name="twsWashPost3"/&gt; If the IRS suspects that property is involved with crime, or has been produced as a result of crime, then it has a [[pretext]] with which to seize it.&lt;ref name="twsWashingtonPost1"/&gt; From 2010 to 2013, two motel owners were under constant threat of their property being seized after there were incidents of drug selling on the motel premises.&lt;ref name="twsBostonGlobe"/&gt; A judge ruled in 2013 that the owners could keep their motel since the owners did not know about the illegal activity and took all reasonable steps to prevent it.&lt;ref name="twsBostonGlobe"/&gt;

{{Quote|I'd like to see this law done away with, or heavily modified&amp;nbsp;... This law, where you are presumed guilty and have to prove yourself innocent, is completely backward from any other law I've ever heard of. It's hard to believe the government has that kind of power. It's ridiculous. Prosecutors abuse it, and the average person can't afford to fight it.|Russell Caswell, motel owner, 2013&lt;ref name="twsBostonGlobe"/&gt;}}

Police seized a house on the [[pretext]] that it was being used for selling drugs, after a couple's son was arrested for selling $40 worth of illegal drugs.&lt;ref name="twsWSJ1"/&gt; In another case, homeowners Carl and Mary Shelden sold their house to a man who was later convicted of fraud, but because of the real estate transaction, the Sheldens got caught up in a 10-year legal battle that left them "virtually bankrupt"; after years, they finally got back their house but it was in badly damaged condition; the Sheldens had done nothing wrong.&lt;ref name="twsLATimes12"/&gt;

===Seizures of vehicles===
In Detroit, men suspected of hiring [[prostitution|prostitutes]] had their automobiles seized.&lt;ref name="twsWashPost3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="twsLATimes12"/&gt; An owner's sailboat was taken after he was caught with a negligible amount of [[marijuana]].&lt;ref name="twsLATimes12"/&gt; Members of the [[Bergen County]] Prosecutor's Office were charged with fraud after knowingly selling counterfeit goods at an asset forfeiture auction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=After Fraud Charges, Bergen Prosecutors Attempt Another Suspicious Auction

===Seizures of firearms===
Five states ([[California]], [[Connecticut]], [[Indiana]], [[New York State|New York]], and [[Oregon]]) have statutes that allow law enforcement officials to seize a person's firearms without a warrant or court order if there is probable cause the individual is mentally unstable or may use the weapons to commit a crime. The weapons are to be held in the custody of the law enforcement agency until the case against the individual is dispositioned in a court of law; or the weapons must be returned to the owner if no criminal charges are filed within the timeframe specified by law. In practice, some law enforcement agencies in these states have been known to either sell or destroy seized firearms without compensating the owner after the legal matter that led to the initial seizure has been settled.

===Seizures of funds in a bank account===
The government can seize money directly from a bank account. One way this happens is when there are large numbers of cash deposits that government investigators suspect are [[structuring | structured]] as a way to avoid deposits exceeding $10,000, since deposits greater than that amount must be reported to the federal government. But it can happen that legitimate businesses have regular large deposits of cash. In one instance, the [[Internal Revenue Service]] waited for large deposits to be placed into an owner's bank account, and then forced the bank by legal means to surrender it to the agency by means of a secret warrant;&lt;ref name="twsWashingtonPost1"/&gt; authorities took $135,000 from Michigan restaurant owners, named the Cheung family, who made cash deposits from their Chinese restaurant.&lt;ref name="twsUSAToday1"/&gt; In another instance, a businessman in [[New Jersey]] made repeated cash deposits to save for purchasing a house; each payment was below the $10,000 threshold for reporting to the government, but there were 21 deposits over a period of four months, which caused government to suspect that criminal activity was involved; as a result, the IRS seized $157,000 and the businessman was forced to hire an attorney to get his funds returned.&lt;ref name="twsWSJ5"/&gt; Officials seized $35,000 from the bank account of a grocery store "without any warning or explanation" in 2013.&lt;ref name="twsUSAToday1"/&gt;

===Contested seizures===
After police and authorities have possession of cash or other seized property, there are two ways in which the seized assets become permanently theirs: first, if a prosecutor can prove that seized assets were connected to criminal activity in a courtroom, or second, if nobody tries to claim the seized assets.&lt;ref name="twsBaltimoreSun1"/&gt; What happens in many instances is that the assets revert to police ownership by default. If a victim challenges the seizure, prosecutors sometimes offer to return half of the seized funds as part of a deal in exchange for not suing.&lt;ref name="twsNPR1"/&gt; Sometimes police, challenged by lawyers or by victims, volunteer to return all of the money provided that the victim promises not to sue police or prosecutors; according to ''The Washington Post'', many victims sign simply to get some or all of their money back.&lt;ref name="twsWashPost4"/&gt; Victims often have "long legal struggles to get their money back".&lt;ref name="twsWashPost4"/&gt; One estimate was that only one percent of federally taken property is ever returned to their former owners.&lt;ref name="twsSFGate"/&gt;

Statistical evidence suggests a strong upward trend in recent years towards greater seizure activity. In 1986, the Department of Justice's ''Asset Forfeiture Fund'' took in $93.7 million; in 2008, it took in $1 billion.&lt;ref name="twsForbes1"/&gt; Much of this growth happened in the past decade; one analysis suggested that seizures had grown 600 percent from 2002 to 2012.&lt;ref name="twsSFGate"/&gt; From 2005 to 2010, government seizures of assets from both criminals as well as innocent citizens went from $1.25 billion to $2.50 billion.&lt;ref name="twsWSJ5"/&gt; Federal authorities seized over $4 billion in 2013 through forfeiture, with some of the money being taken from innocent victims.&lt;ref name="twsUSAToday1"/&gt; In 2010, there were 15,000 cases of forfeitures.&lt;ref name="twsWSJ5"/&gt; Over 12 years, agencies have taken $20 billion in cash, securities, other property from drug bosses and Wall Street tycoons as well as "ordinary Americans who have not committed crimes".&lt;ref name="twsSFGate"/&gt; One estimate was that in 85% of civil forfeiture instances, the property owner was never charged with a crime.&lt;ref name="twsWashPost3"/&gt; In 2010, there were 11,000 noncriminal forfeiture cases.&lt;ref name="twsWSJ5"/&gt; In 2010, claimants challenged 1,800 civil forfeiture seizures in federal court.&lt;ref name="twsWSJ5"/&gt;

Civil forfeiture varies greatly state by state. An analysis by [[Sarah Stillman]] in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' suggested that states that place seized funds in neutral accounts, such as [[Maine]], [[Missouri]] (which puts seized funds in accounts for public education), [[North Dakota]], and [[Vermont]], have been much less likely to have major scandals involving forfeiture abuse.&lt;ref name="twsNewYorker1"/&gt; States like [[Texas]] and [[Virginia]] and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], which have few restrictions on how police use the seized funds have had more scandals, as well as states that allow the [[Equitable sharing]] program. With Equitable Sharing, state police can "skirt state restrictions on the use of funds", according to Stillman.&lt;ref name="twsNewYorker1"/&gt; In [[Florida]], using Equitable Sharing, the small village of [[Bal Harbour, Florida|Bal Harbour]] raked in at least $71.5 million in three years by its vice squad by carrying out an undercover money laundering sting operation, but in the end, made no arrests.&lt;ref name="twsNewYorker1"/&gt;
;Florida: Allows [[Equitable sharing]] between state and federal agencies.&lt;ref name="twsNewYorker1"/&gt;
;Georgia: There are few restrictions on how police use seized assets.&lt;ref name="twsNewYorker1"/&gt; Georgia investigators found more than $700,000 in "questionable expenses" by Camden County's sheriff between 2004 and 2008, including a $90,000 [[Dodge Viper]] and a $79,000 boat.&lt;ref name="twsWashPost2"/&gt;
;Maine: Seized funds go into neutral accounts.&lt;ref name="twsNewYorker1"/&gt;
;Maryland: In Maryland, police forfeitures were $6 million in 2012 and $2.8 million in 2013.&lt;ref name="twsBaltimoreSun1"/&gt;
;Minnesota: Minnesota passed a law in 2014 forbidding authorities from confiscating a suspect's property unless they have been convicted of a crime or plead guilty to committing it.&lt;ref name="twsWashPost12"/&gt;
;Missouri: Seized funds go into accounts earmarked for public education.&lt;ref name="twsNewYorker1"/&gt;
;Montana: In June 2015, governor Steve Bullock signed a law requiring authorities to first get a criminal conviction before seizing property through civil forfeiture.&lt;ref name=twsForbes2&gt;Nick Sibilla, July 2, 2015, Forbes, [https://www.forbes.com/sites/instituteforjustice/2015/07/02/civil-forfeiture-now-requires-a-criminal-conviction-in-montana-and-new-mexico/ Civil Forfeiture Now Requires A Criminal Conviction In Montana And New Mexico], Retrieved July 3, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

;Nevada: There were allegations that [[Nevada]] police unlawfully took tens of thousands of dollars from motorists.&lt;ref name="twsWSJ8"/&gt;
;New Mexico: Government took $800,000 from a used car dealer in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and held his money for many months before giving it back, but the seizure had an adverse effect on his business and on the owner's health.&lt;ref name="twsUSAToday1"/&gt; In 2015, New Mexico Governor [[Susana Martinez]] signed a bill into law making Civil Forfeiture illegal in New Mexico. The prohibition does not apply to property directly connected to the commission of a crime (e.g., money or property obtained through drug trafficking, or stolen property)&lt;ref name=twsForbes2/&gt;&lt;ref name="twsabqjournal"/&gt;
;New York: New York City ransacked a home, seized cash, but it was later returned.&lt;ref name="twsWashPost3"/&gt;
;North Carolina: Abolished civil forfeiture almost entirely.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;
;North Dakota: Seized funds go into neutral accounts.&lt;ref name="twsNewYorker1"/&gt;
;Oklahoma: Seized funds or property are forfeited if any connection to any drug crime is proved by a preponderance of the evidence. Once forfeited, the seizing agency can keep and use the funds largely at its [[discretion]]. Due to the lack of any state reporting or centralized accounting, no accurate total of seizures is available, but estimates tend to run in the tens of millions each year, much from known drug trafficking corridors such as [[Interstate 40]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Forfeiture foes debate from opposite ends of the turnpike|url= http://www.tulsaworld.com/homepagelatest/forfeiture-foes-debate-from-opposite-ends-of-the-turnpike/article_e60fc566-a8bc-5144-8c53-e9f5406a4921.html|accessdate= 2015-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notable abuses of forfeiture funds include prosecutors paying off student loans and living in seized houses rent free.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Law Enforcement Seizures Misspent, Missing|url= http://oklahomawatch.org/2015/07/15/law-enforcement-seizures-misspent-missing/|website= Oklahoma Watch|accessdate= 2015-10-03|first= Clifton|last= Adcock}}&lt;/ref&gt;
;Pennsylvania: In Philadelphia, it is often the homes of African-Americans and Hispanics who are targeted by civil forfeiture abuses; what happens in many instances is that a child or grandchild who doesn't own the home is nabbed on a drug-related offense, and police use this as a [[pretext]] to seize the entire home.&lt;ref name="twsNewYorker1"/&gt; In Philadelphia, authorities made thousands of "small-dollar seizures"; in 2010, the city filed 8,000 forfeiture cases, which amounted to $550 for the average take.&lt;ref name="twsWSJ1"/&gt; From 2002 to 2012, Philadelphia seized $64 million by means of its forfeiture program, a total that was more than that seized by [[Brooklyn, New York|Brooklyn]] and [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] combined.&lt;ref name="twsWSJ1"/&gt;
;Texas: In Texas, in [[Jim Wells County, Texas|Jim Wells County]], authorities seized more than $1.5 million during a four-year period mostly off of [[U.S. Route 281]], described as a "prime smuggling route for drugs going north and money coming south".&lt;ref name="twsNPR1"/&gt; Seized cash is a third of the budget of the sheriff's department, allowing it to buy more equipment, high-powered rifles, and police vehicles.&lt;ref name="twsNPR1"/&gt; There are few restrictions on how police use seized funds.&lt;ref name="twsNewYorker1"/&gt; In some counties in [[Texas]], 40% of police revenue comes from forfeitures.&lt;ref name="twsNewYorker1"/&gt; Texas, with many smuggling corridors to Mexico, and police seized $125 million in 2007.&lt;ref name="twsNPR3"/&gt;

==Controversy==
Civil forfeiture has generated substantial controversy.

===Proponents===
[[File:FBI Civil forfeiture image.jpg|thumb|right|[[FBI]] [[special agent]] Douglas Leff argues that civil forfeiture is a necessary tool for law enforcement to combat [[money laundering]] by criminal operatives.]]

Proponents argue that civil forfeiture tactics are necessary to help police fight serious crime.&lt;ref name="twsSFGate"/&gt; It is seen as a vital and powerful weapon in the continuing battle against illegal drugs,&lt;ref name="twsLATimes12"/&gt;&lt;ref name="twsNYT14"/&gt; and effective at discouraging criminal activity.&lt;ref name="twsWSJ5"/&gt;&lt;ref name="twsWashingtonPost1"/&gt; It makes it easier for law enforcement to fight [[organized crime]] when they had trouble imprisoning offenders, since they could deprive them of their property and income when it is much harder to prove their guilt in a court of law.&lt;ref name="twsWashPost3"/&gt;

{{Quote|Prosecutors choose civil forfeiture not because of the standard of proof, but because it is often the only way to confiscate the instrumentalities of crime. The alternative, criminal forfeiture, requires a criminal trial and a conviction. Without civil forfeiture, we could not confiscate the assets of drug cartels whose leaders remain beyond the reach of United States extradition laws and who cannot be brought to trial. Moreover, criminal forfeiture reaches only a defendant's own property. Without civil forfeiture, an airplane used to smuggle drugs could not be seized, even if the pilot was arrested, because the pilot invariably is not the owner of the plane. Nor could law enforcement agencies confiscate cash carried by a drug courier who doesn't own it, or a building turned into a "crack house" by tenants with the knowing approval of the landlord.|Gerald E. Mcdowell Chief, Asset Forfeiture &amp; Money Laundering Section, Dept. of Justice, 1996, writing in ''[[The New York Times]]''&lt;ref name="twsNYT14"/&gt;}}

The head of the asset forfeiture section of the Department of Justice said that civil forfeiture of cash from innocents was insignificant compared to the "thousands of traffic stops" that bust major drug money couriers.&lt;ref name="twsNPR1"/&gt;

{{Quote|What's troubling to you? That a drug trafficker who's bringing money from the U.S. to Mexico, who's carrying hundreds of thousands of millions of dollars in cash in their pickup truck, who just sold dope and crack and cocaine to children in your playgrounds, and his money is being taken away? That troubles you?|Richard Weber, US Justice Department, 2008&lt;ref name="twsNPR1"/&gt;}}

[[File:BernardMadoff.jpg|thumb|right|Police used civil forfeiture laws to help return swindled funds to their owners. Photo: Convicted swindler [[Bernard Madoff]].]]
Civil forfeiture has been used to restore money stolen by fraud and other schemes by corrupt politicians.&lt;ref name="twsNYT19"/&gt; Civil forfeiture targets [[cybercrime]], fraud, and scams in high finance at [[Wall Street]], and money-laundering on a global scale.&lt;ref name="twsSFGate"/&gt; It enables police to have sufficient power to "return money to crime victims" in instances of swindling or fraud.&lt;ref name="twsWSJ5"/&gt; Civil forfeiture laws were helpful in enabling authorities to seize and return swindled funds by the [[Bernard Madoff]] fraud.&lt;ref name="twsWSJ5"/&gt;

Proponents argue that government has sufficient safeguards in place so that individuals can challenge seizures if the need arises.&lt;ref name="twsNPR1"/&gt; Justice [[William H. Rehnquist]] said in a Supreme Court decision that federal forfeiture in drug-related cases was not a [[punishment]] but served nonpunitive purposes such as encouraging people to be careful that their property was not used illegally.&lt;ref name="twsNYTimes17"/&gt; A [[Lobbying in the United States|lobbyist]] for the [[Maryland State Police]] named Thomas Williams argued that bills to require police to keep better records of seized property would cost law enforcement more time and money, and that trying to track seizures by multi-agency task forces would not be easy.&lt;ref name="twsBaltimoreSun1"/&gt; Proponents say that when claimants contest the seizures, they rarely win back their money, suggesting that the "system is working properly".&lt;ref name="twsWSJ5"/&gt; Proponents say the system is monitored to make sure seizures are properly done.&lt;ref name="twsWSJ5"/&gt; In addition, the funds enable police forces to equip themselves further for more effective crime prevention; for example, a $3.8 million drug bust let officers equip their cars with $1,700 video cameras and heat-sensing equipment for a seven-member force.&lt;ref name="twsLATimes12"/&gt;

===Critics===
Critics include citizens, defense attorneys, and advocates for [[civil rights]].&lt;ref name="twsLATimes12"/&gt;
They point to serious instances of abuse in which innocent owners have been victimized.&lt;ref name="twsSFGate"/&gt; Critics are from both sides of the political spectrum, from left-leaning groups such as the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] and right-leaning groups such as [[The Heritage Foundation]].&lt;ref name="twsWSJ5"/&gt; The main criticisms of civil forfeiture proceedings are as follows:

*'''Flawed judicial process'''. Critics suggest that civil forfeitures are mostly "devoid of due process".&lt;ref name="twsWashingtonPost1"/&gt; Arguments have been made that the seizures violate the [[Due Process Clause]] of the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] since owners have few means to challenge the seizures.&lt;ref name="twsWashPost12"/&gt; They see some seizures as assaults against [[rights|individual rights]].&lt;ref name="twsUSAToday1"/&gt; Critics argue that criminals are treated better in the courts than innocent owners who have property seized, since criminals are often told they have a right to an attorney, and that the [[beyond a reasonable doubt]] standard of proof is much higher in criminal trials than in civil trials.&lt;ref name="twsWashingtonPost1"/&gt; Burden of proof is shifted to victims to prove innocence.&lt;ref name="twsForbes1"/&gt; Victims of civil forfeiture are considered guilty until proven innocent, thereby turning the principle of [[presumption of innocence|innocent until proven guilty]] on its head.&lt;ref name="twsWSJ1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="twsUSAToday1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="twsWashingtonPost1"/&gt; Because it is part of the civil justice system, there are no attorneys provided for defendants as can happen in some criminal trials; people who can not afford an attorney have slim chances of recovering their property.&lt;ref name="twsWSJ1"/&gt; Most cases are never heard by a jury or judge since victims are unable to fight the seizures by hiring a lawyer.&lt;ref name="twsUSAToday1"/&gt; In contrast to principles of [[open justice]], seizures are often done through sealed documents with a lack of [[transparency (behavior)|transparency]].&lt;ref name="twsSFGate"/&gt; Clinical law professor Louis Rulli of the [[University of Pennsylvania]] said that a piece of property does not have the same [[rights]] as a human: no [[right to counsel|right to an attorney]], no [[presumption of innocence]].&lt;ref name="twsNewYorker1"/&gt;
*'''Excessive punishment'''. Justice [[John Paul Stevens]] said in a single dissenting vote in 1996 that civil forfeiture of a house, in which marijuana had been illegally processed, was an example of an [[United States constitutional sentencing law#Excessive fines|excessive fine]], and a violation of the [[Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Eighth Amendment]], although the majority of the court disagreed.&lt;ref name="twsNYTimes17"/&gt;

[[File:1000 United States two-dollar bills in shrink wrap.jpg|thumb|Critics contend that the lure of cash tempts police towards subverting the rules for personal gain.]]
*'''Motivates police misbehavior'''. Critics contend that the system is set up in a way as to incentivize "perverse behavior" by "predatory government agencies".&lt;ref name="twsWashingtonPost1"/&gt; It makes it possible for government officials to seize [[property]] such as cash, vehicles, houses, and jewelry from people without ever convicting them for wrongdoing in a court or even charging them with a crime.&lt;ref name="twsUSAToday1"/&gt; The cash and assets are a major temptation for police to presume that activity is illegal. Critics say the huge amount of money involved have a distorting effect on police, such that they are more interested in seizing cash rather than illegal drugs.&lt;ref name="twsNPR3"/&gt; Seized assets can be used for police office expenses, new equipment, vehicles.&lt;ref name="twsNPR3"/&gt; The [[profit motive]], in which police can keep 90% or more of profits, "forms the rotten core of forfeiture abuse".&lt;ref name="twsForbes1"/&gt; Prosecutors and police have a strong incentive to seize property since the funds can be used to pay expenses of the District Attorney's office, including salaries. Over a ten-year period, the forfeiture money collected was $25 million in Philadelphia, with seized funds being used to pay salaries for people working in the District Attorney's office.&lt;ref name="twsWSJ1"/&gt; When funds are returned to the victim, it can happen that the funds come out of taxpayer money, not out of police funds such as a pension fund.&lt;ref name="twsWashPost3"/&gt; Seized amounts of money have gone for new police equipment, parties, travel expenses, training seminars, sometimes held in distant locations such as [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]] or [[Hawaii]].&lt;ref name="twsWashPost3"/&gt; A Texas prosecutor used $25,000 in seized cash to take his office staff including spouses and a judge on a vacation to Hawaii.&lt;ref name="twsWashPost3"/&gt; There are no penalties for wrongful seizures, particularly when taxpayers pay when ill-gotten gains from innocent citizens must be returned, so there is an incentive to "find" a drug-related issue when police come across cash.&lt;ref name="twsWashPost3"/&gt; The incentives work against police seizing drugs but push them to seize cash instead:

::{{Quote|If a cop stops a car going north with a trunk full of cocaine, that makes great press coverage, makes a great photo. Then they destroy the cocaine&amp;nbsp;... If they catch 'em going south with a suitcase full of cash, the police department just paid for its budget for the year.|Jack Fishman, former IRS agent, criminal defense attorney, 2008&lt;ref name="twsNPR3"/&gt;}}

*'''Innocent owners ensnared'''. Critics argue that innocent owners suffer emotionally and financially.&lt;ref name="twsWashPost4"/&gt;
*'''Difficult to challenge seizures'''. The process forces property owners with limited financial abilities to have to hire attorneys and take time and money simply to "prove their innocence".&lt;ref name="twsWashingtonPost1"/&gt; Victims must actively fight to recover their seized property; if they do nothing, or wait, then they will lose everything.&lt;ref name="twsWashingtonPost1"/&gt; If victims do not seek help from sympathetic lawyers such as those of the [[Institute for Justice]], they can sometimes be offered to have a fraction of their property returned as part of a deal; critics have described the IRS as "bullies" practicing "extortion" against innocent citizens.&lt;ref name="twsWashingtonPost1"/&gt; Procedures to get money back are often fraught with difficulty.&lt;ref name="twsWashPost3"/&gt; Retrieving seized property can be a "bureaucratic nightmare" where victims meet not with a judge or jury but with a prosecutor.&lt;ref name="twsWSJ1"/&gt;
*'''Arbitrary punishments'''. Critics suggest that civil forfeitures can be arbitrary, varying significantly from one case to another; for example, Alan Finder in ''[[The New York Times]]'' wondered whether it was "fair that one driver loses a car worth $45,000 and another loses one worth $700?", if each situation resulted from drunk driving arrests.&lt;ref name="twsNYT432"/&gt;
*'''Unfairly targets poor and politically weak persons'''. Many victims of civil forfeiture are "poor and politically weak" and unable to mount a sustained battle in the courts to get their property returned.&lt;ref name="twsWashPost12"/&gt;
*'''Subverts state law'''. Local and state police often cooperate with federal authorities in what has been called [[equitable sharing]] agreements.&lt;ref name="twsWashPost2"/&gt; Since many states have laws restricting or limiting civil forfeitures, as well as requiring higher standards of proof before property can be taken, local police can sidestep these rules by treating the suspected criminal activity as a federal crime, and bringing in federal authorities.&lt;ref name="twsWashPost2"/&gt; As a result, after the seizure, local and federal agencies divvy up the "loot" with 10% to 20% of it going to the federal agency and the remainder to the local police force.&lt;ref name="twsWashPost2"/&gt; Accordingly, equitable sharing "effectively subverts the will and intent of the state legislatures" and has been criticized by prominent [[civil rights]] attorney and [[property rights]] advocate [[Scott Bullock]] as being a "complete violation" of the principle of [[federalism]].&lt;ref name="twsWashPost2"/&gt;
*'''Extent of abuse'''. Proponents and critics differ about the extent of cases in which innocent persons had their property seized. Proponents argue that the cases are few in number, while critics contend that many instances of abuse happen without awareness by the public as a result of the signing of waivers, victims not challenging seizures for lack of knowledge, and other reasons related to a general lack of judicial transparency. The ''[[Baltimore Sun]]'' made reports that in 2012, half of victims with seized assets were not convicted of a crime.&lt;ref name="twsBaltimoreSun1"/&gt;

===Efforts at reform===
[[File:John Oliver Occupy Wall Street 2011 Shankbone.JPG|thumb|upright|Comedian and political commentator [[John Oliver (comedian)|John Oliver]] did a sixteen-minute segment on his show ''[[Last Week Tonight with John Oliver|Last Week Tonight]]'' in 2014 discussing civil forfeiture.]]
There have been numerous reports in the media about systemic abuse of civil forfeiture. ''[[USA Today]]'' described it as "an increasingly common—and utterly outrageous—practice that can amount to legalized theft by police".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Editorial Board|title=When police play bounty hunter: Our view: Civil asset forfeiture is government at its absolute worst.|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2014/11/19/police-civil-asset-forfeiture-profit-drug-trafficking-editorials-debates/19299879/|accessdate=7 December 2014|work=USA Today|date=20 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reporter [[Sarah Stillman]] writing in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' interviewed numerous police officers, lawyers, prosecutors, justices and plaintiffs around the United States and found that many had reservations that innocent Americans were being abused.&lt;ref name="twsNewYorker1"/&gt; ''The New Yorker'' published a "sprawling investigation" about how cities abuse civil forfeiture to "bolster their cash-strapped coffers by seizing the assets of the poor, often on trumped up charges".&lt;ref name="twsWashPost3"/&gt; Comedian [[John Oliver (comedian)|John Oliver]] devoted a presentation to a satirical exposure of civil forfeiture in 2014.

Organizations working for reform, as well as helping individual victims, include the [[Institute for Justice]], a [[libertarian]] [[nonprofit]] law firm in Washington, D.C., which works to end civil forfeiture abuse.&lt;ref name="twsWashingtonPost1"/&gt; It has helped numerous clients recover property seized by the government.&lt;ref name="twsWashingtonPost1"/&gt; The Institute of Justice is helping one forfeiture victim sue the federal district court as well as the mayor, district attorney, and police commissioner in Philadelphia.&lt;ref name="twsWSJ1"/&gt; Scott Bullock, senior attorney at the Institute for Justice, advocates that civil forfeiture should be abolished except for use in enforcing maritime and customs laws, and require that any seizures be linked to criminal convictions of specific people.&lt;ref name=twsIJ/&gt; If that is not possible, Bullock recommends that seized revenues be placed in neutral funds such as [[drug rehabilitation|drug treatment efforts]], that standards of proof for law enforcement be raised to ensure that police provide "clear and convincing evidence" of wrongdoing, that the [[Legal burden of proof|burden of proof]] should be moved to government to prove wrongdoing, that seized assets should be tracked such that information is easily accessible by the public, and that the [[equitable sharing]] arrangement be abolished.&lt;ref name=twsIJ&gt;[[Scott Bullock]], Institute for Justice, [http://www.ij.org/foreword-2 Policing for Profit: Foreword -- Recommendations for Reform], Retrieved October 21, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes victims turn to the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU) for legal assistance in winning back their seized property.&lt;ref name="twsSFGate"/&gt;

There has been opposition to civil forfeiture in some lower courts.&lt;ref name="twsNYTimes17"/&gt; There have been attempts by lawmakers to introduce legislation to prevent abuses based on civil forfeiture procedures; one proposal was to raise the standard of proof necessary before property could be seized, and require government to prove that an owner of property was involved in an illegal criminal activity before such seizures could happen.&lt;ref name="twsWashPost2"/&gt; There have been [[class action lawsuit]]s against authorities, such as one in East [[Texas]] by black and Latino drivers; the suit alleges that police took $3 million from 2006 to 2008 in 140 separate incidents.&lt;ref name="twsWSJ8"/&gt; One reform effort is to require authorities to keep better records about seized assets.&lt;ref name="twsBaltimoreSun1"/&gt;

In 2015, the New Mexico legislature outlawed civil forfeiture.&lt;ref name="twsabqjournal"/&gt; Also in 2015 a number of criminal justice reformers, including the [[Koch family foundations]] and the ACLU, announced plans to advocate the reduction of asset forfeitures due to the disproportionate penalty it places on low-income wrongdoers; the forfeiture of private property in such cases often results in the deprivation of the majority of an individual's wealth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://cjonline.com/news/2015-10-15/forfeiture-reform-aligns-likes-billionaire-charles-koch-aclu |title=Forfeiture reform aligns likes of billionaire Charles Koch, ACLU |work=The Topeka Capital Journal |date=Oct 15, 2015 |author=Hudetz, Mary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As civil forfeiture may not be allowed a new practice has emerged. By classifying valuables such as cars, cellphones, and wallets with cash as evidence the police can keep them and by making it very difficult and time consuming to get them back.

The [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] (DEA) has been using civil forfeiture as one way of funding their efforts to combat the use of illegal drugs, including marijuana, which continues to be illegal to possess under Federal law as of 2016.&lt;ref name="deaurling1"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.dea.gov/divisions/hq/2016/hq081116.shtml |title=DEA Announces Actions Related to Marijuana and Industrial Hemp |publisher=United States Drug Enforcement Administration |date=August 11, 2016 |accessdate=August 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dearuling 2"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/08/11/health/dea-marijuana-schedule-l/ |title=DEA declines to loosen restrictions on medical marijuana |publisher=CNN |date=August 12, 2016 |accessdate=August 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to government figures, the DEA collected $18 million in 2013 as part of its Cannabis Eradication Program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=U.S. Department of Justice|title=Drug Enforcement Administration FY 2014 Performance Budget Congressional Submission|url=http://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/jmd/legacy/2014/05/16/dea-justification.pdf/|accessdate=10 February 2016|work=Drug Enforcement Administration|date=16 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents in favor of legalizing marijuana have objected to this practice, which includes DEA seizures of properties in which marijuana is used and sold.

A report in ''[[The Guardian]]'' in 2015 suggested that such shops operated in a "tricky gray zone", so that even in the 23 states where medicinal cannabis is legal, such dispensaries can be "wiped out by a single visit from law enforcement".&lt;ref name="twsGuardian787"&gt;{{cite news

On the other, cannabis is listed under the federal Controlled Substances Act as a drug with "no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse". As such, small, legal dispensaries can be wiped out by a single visit from law enforcement.&amp;nbsp;...
}}&lt;/ref&gt; While state law may recognize such establishments as having a legal purpose, federal law does not recognize this, and conflicting interpretations can emerge, which can result in properties being confiscated.&lt;ref name="twsGuardian787"/&gt; It has sparked controversy and, in some instances, public outrage.

'''Civilian control of the military''' is a doctrine in [[military science|military]] and [[political science]] that places ultimate [[command responsibility|responsibility]] for a [[Country|country's]] [[military strategy|strategic]] [[Group decision making|decision-making]] in the hands of the [[civilian]] [[politics|political]] [[leadership]], rather than professional [[military]] [[Officer (armed forces)|officers]]. The reverse situation, where professional military officers control national politics, is called a [[military dictatorship]]. A lack of control over the military may result in a [[state within a state]]. One author, paraphrasing [[Samuel P. Huntington]]'s writings in ''[[The Soldier and the State]]'', has summarized the civilian control ideal as "the proper subordination of a competent, professional military to the ends of policy as determined by civilian authority".&lt;ref name=Taylor&gt;Taylor, Edward R. ''[http://handle.dtic.mil/100.2/ADA346358 Command in the 21st Century: An Introduction to Civil-Military Affairs]'' ([[pdf]]), [[United States Navy]] [[Postgraduate]] School thesis. 1998: 30-32.&lt;/ref&gt;

Civilian control is often seen as a prerequisite feature of a stable [[liberal democracy]]. Use of the term in scholarly analyses tends to take place in the context of a [[democracy]] governed by [[election|elected]] [[official]]s, though the subordination of the military to [[politics|political control]] is not unique to these societies. One example is the [[China|People's Republic of China]]. [[Mao Zedong]] stated that "Our principle is that the Party commands the gun, and the gun must never be allowed to command the Party," reflecting the primacy of the [[Communist Party of China]] (and [[Communist party|communist parties]] in general) as decision-makers in [[Marxism-Leninism|Marxist–Leninist]] and [[Maoism|Maoist]] theories of [[democratic centralism]].&lt;ref name=Mao-War&gt;[[Mao Zedong]], English language translation by Marxists.org.

As noted by [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]] professor [[Richard H. Kohn]], "civilian control is not a fact but a process".&lt;ref name=Kohn&gt;Kohn, Richard H. [http://www.unc.edu/depts/diplomat/AD_Issues/amdipl_3/kohn.html An Essay on Civilian Control of the Military]. 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; Affirmations of respect for the values of civilian control notwithstanding, the actual level of control sought or achieved by the civilian leadership may vary greatly in practice, from a statement of broad policy goals that military [[commander]]s are expected to translate into [[military operation|operational]] plans, to the direct selection of specific targets for attack on the part of governing [[politician]]s. [[Head of government|National Leaders]] with limited experience in military matters often have little choice but to rely on the advice of professional military commanders trained in the [[operational art|art]] and [[military science|science]] of warfare to inform the limits of policy; in such cases, the military establishment may enter the [[bureaucracy|bureaucratic]] arena to advocate for or against a particular course of action, shaping the policy-making process and blurring any clear-cut lines of civilian control.

Advocates of civilian control generally take a [[Carl von Clausewitz|Clausewitzian]] view of [[war]], emphasizing its [[policy|political]] character.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}  The [[wikiquote:Georges Clemenceau|words]] of [[Georges Clemenceau]], "War is too serious a matter to entrust to military men" (also frequently rendered as "War is too important to be left to the [[general]]s"), wryly reflect this view. Given that broad [[military strategy|strategic]] decisions, such as the decision to declare a war, start an invasion, or end a conflict, have a major impact on the [[citizen]]s of the country, they are seen by civilian control advocates as best guided by the will of the people (as expressed by their [[representative government|political representatives]]), rather than left solely to an elite group of tactical experts. The [[military]] serves as a special [[government agency]], which is supposed to ''implement'', rather than ''formulate'', policies that require the use of certain types of physical force. Kohn succinctly summarizes this view when he writes that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The point of civilian control is to make security subordinate to the larger purposes of a nation, rather than the other way around. The purpose of the military is to defend society, not to define it.&lt;ref name=Kohn /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A [[State (polity)|state's]] effective use of force is an issue of great concern for all national leaders, who must rely on the military to supply this aspect of their [[authority]]. The danger of granting military leaders full [[Wiktionary:autonomy|autonomy]] or sovereignty is that they may ignore or supplant the democratic decision-making process, and use physical force, or the threat of physical force, to achieve their preferred outcomes; in the worst cases, this may lead to a [[coup]] or [[military dictatorship]]. A related danger is the use of the military to crush domestic [[political opposition]] through intimidation or sheer physical force, interfering with the ability to have free and fair [[election]]s, a key part of the democratic process. This poses the paradox that "because we fear others we create an institution of violence to protect us, but then we fear the very institution we created for protection".&lt;ref&gt;Peter D. Feaver.  1996. "The Civil-Military Problematique: Huntington, Janowitz and the Question of Civilian Control."  [http://afs.sagepub.com/cgi/reprint/23/2/149 ''Armed Forces &amp; Society'']. 23(2): 149–78.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, military personnel, because of the nature of their job, are much more willing to use force to settle disputes than civilians because they are trained military personnel that specialize strictly in warfare. The military is authoritative and hierarchical, rarely allowing discussion and prohibiting dissention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unc.edu/depts/diplomat/AD_Issues/amdipl_3/kohn.html |title=Kohn: Civilian Control |publisher=Unc.edu |date= |accessdate=2015-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, in the [[Empire of Japan]], [[Prime Minister of Japan|prime ministers]] and almost everyone in high positions were military people like [[Hideki Tojo]], and advocated and basically pressured the leaders to start military conflicts against China and others because they believed that they would ultimately be victorious.

===Liberal theory and the American Founding Fathers===
Many of the [[Founding Fathers of the United States]] were suspicious of [[Standing army|standing militaries]].  As [[Samuel Adams]] wrote in 1768, "Even when there is a necessity of the military power, within a land, a wise and prudent people will always have a watchful and jealous eye over it".&lt;ref name=Cairo&gt;Cairo, Michael F. ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20051026185242/http://usinfo.state.gov/products/pubs/democracy/dmpaper12.htm Democracy Papers: Civilian Control of the Military]'', [[U.S. Department of State]] International Information Programs.&lt;/ref&gt; Even more forceful are the words of [[Elbridge Gerry]], a [[delegate]] to the American [[Philadelphia Convention|Constitutional Convention]], who wrote that "[s]tanding armies in time of peace are inconsistent with the principles of republican Governments, dangerous to the liberties of a free people, and generally converted into destructive engines for establishing despotism."&lt;ref name=Cairo /&gt;

In [[Federalist No. 8]], one of ''[[The Federalist]]'' papers documenting the ideas of some of the Founding Fathers, [[Alexander Hamilton]] expressed concern that maintaining a large standing army would be a dangerous and expensive undertaking.  In his principal argument for the ratification of the proposed constitution, he argued that only by maintaining a strong union could the new country avoid such a pitfall.  Using the European experience as a negative example and the British experience as a positive one, he presented the idea of a strong nation protected by a navy with no need of a standing army.  The implication was that control of a large military force is, at best, difficult and expensive, and at worst invites war and division.  He foresaw the necessity of creating a civilian government that kept the military at a distance.

[[James Madison]], another writer of many of ''The Federalist'' papers,&lt;ref&gt;Gottfried Dietze. 1960. ''The Federalist: A Classic on Federalism and Free Government''. Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins Press.&lt;/ref&gt; expressed his concern about a standing military in comments before the Constitutional Convention in June 1787:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
In time of actual war, great discretionary powers are constantly given to the Executive Magistrate.  Constant apprehension of War, has the same tendency to render the head too large for the body.  A standing military force, with an overgrown Executive, will not long be safe companions to liberty.  The means of defense against foreign danger, have been always the instruments of tyranny at home.  Among the Romans it was a standing maxim to excite a war, whenever a revolt was apprehended.  Throughout all Europe, the armies kept up under the pretext of defending, have enslaved the people.
&lt;ref&gt;Max Farrand. 1911.  ''[http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/amlaw/lwfr.html Records of the Federal Convention of 1787]''.  New Haven: Yale University Press. 1:465.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[United States Constitution]] placed considerable limitations on the [[legislature]].  Coming from a tradition of [[Parliamentary sovereignty in the United Kingdom|legislative superiority in government]], many were concerned that the proposed Constitution would place so many limitations on the legislature that it would become impossible for such a body to prevent an executive from starting a war.  Hamilton argued in Federalist No. 26 that it would be equally as bad for a legislature to be unfettered by any other agency and that restraints would actually be more likely to preserve liberty.  James Madison, in [[Federalist No. 47]], continued Hamilton’s argument that distributing powers among the various branches of government would prevent any one group from gaining so much power as to become unassailable.  In [[Federalist No. 48]], however, Madison warned that while the separation of powers is important, the departments must not be so far separated as to have no ability to control the others.

Finally, in [[Federalist No. 51]], Madison argued that to create a government that relied primarily on the good nature of the incumbent to ensure proper government was folly.  Institutions must be in place to check incompetent or malevolent leaders.  Most importantly, no single branch of government ought to have control over any single aspect of governing.  Thus, all three branches of government must have some control over the military, and the system of checks and balances maintained among the other branches would serve to help control the military.

Hamilton and Madison thus had two major concerns: (1) the detrimental effect on liberty and democracy of a large standing army and (2) the ability of an unchecked legislature or executive to take the country to war precipitously.  These concerns drove American military policy for the first century and a half of the country’s existence.  While armed forces were built up during wartime, the pattern after every war up to and including World War II was to demobilize quickly and return to something approaching pre-war force levels.  However, with the advent of the [[Cold War]] in the 1950s, the need to create and maintain a sizable peacetime military force "engendered new concerns" of militarism and about how such a large force would affect [[civil–military relations]] in the United States.&lt;ref name="ecommons.txstate.edu"&gt;Donald S. Inbody. 2009.  ''Grand Army of the Republic or Grand Army of the Republicans? Political Party and Ideological Preferences of American Enlisted Personnel''. ''[http://ecommons.txstate.edu/polsfacp/51 Faculty Publications – Political Science]''. Paper 51.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Domestic law enforcement===
{{Expand section|date=February 2010}}&lt;!-- do similar laws exist in other countries? --&gt;

The United States' [[Posse Comitatus Act]], passed in 1878, prohibits any part of the Army or the Air Force (since the U.S. Air Force evolved from the U.S. Army) from engaging in domestic law enforcement activities unless they do so pursuant to lawful authority.  Similar prohibitions apply to the Navy and Marine Corps by service regulation, since the actual Posse Comitatus Act does not apply to them.  The Coast Guard is exempt from Posse Comitatus since it normally operates under the [[Department of Homeland Security]] versus the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] and enforces U.S. laws, even when operating as a service with the U.S. Navy.

The act is often misunderstood to prohibit any use of federal military forces in law enforcement, but this is not the case.  For example, the President has explicit authority under the Constitution and federal law to use federal forces or federalized militias to enforce the laws of the United States.  The act's primary purpose is to prevent local law enforcement officials from utilizing federal forces in this way by forming a "posse" consisting of federal Soldiers or Airmen.&lt;ref name=Hendell&gt;Hendell, Garri B. "[http://publius.oxfordjournals.org/content/41/2/336]" "Domestic Use of the Armed Forces to Maintain Law and Order—posse comitatus Pitfalls at the Inauguration of the 44th President" Publius (2011) 41(2): 336-348 first published online May 6, 2010 {{doi|10.1093/publius/pjq014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are, however, practical political concerns in the United States that make the use of federal military forces less desirable for use in domestic law enforcement.  Under the U.S. Constitution, law and order is primarily a matter of state concern.  As a practical matter, when military forces are necessary to maintain domestic order and enforce the laws, state [[Militia organizations in the United States|militia]] forces under state control i.e., that state's [[Army National Guard]] and/or [[Air National Guard]] are usually the force of first resort, followed by federalized state militia forces i.e., the Army National Guard and/or Air National Guard "federalized" as part of the U.S. Army and/or U.S. Air Force, with active federal forces (to include "federal" reserve component forces other than the National Guard) being the least politically palatable option.

===Maoist approach===
[[Maoism|Maoist]] military-political theories of [[people's war]] and [[democratic centralism]] also support the subordination of military forces to the directives of the [[communist party]] (although the [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] experience of many early leading [[Communist Party of China]] figures may make their status as [[civilian]]s somewhat ambiguous). In a 1929 essay ''On Correcting Mistaken Ideas in the Party'', [[Mao Zedong|Mao]] explicitly refuted "comrades [who] regard military affairs and politics as opposed to each other and [who] refuse to recognize that military affairs are only one means of accomplishing political tasks", prescribing increased scrutiny of the [[People's Liberation Army]] by the Party and greater political training of officers and enlistees as a means of reducing military autonomy &lt;ref name=Mao-Party&gt;[[Mao Zedong]], [[English language]] translation by Marxists.org. ''[http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/mao/selected-works/volume-1/mswv1_5.htm On Correcting Mistaken Ideas in the Party]''. 1929.&lt;/ref&gt;. In Mao's &lt;!-- in all Communist?--&gt;theory, the military—which serves both as a symbol of the [[revolution]] and an instrument of the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]]—is not merely expected to defer to the direction of the ruling non-uniformed Party members (who today exercise control in the [[People's Republic of China]] through the [[Central Military Commission]]), but also to actively participate in the revolutionary political campaigns of the Maoist era.

== Methods of asserting civilian control ==
[[Image:MacArthur Manila.jpg|thumb|An immensely popular hero of [[World War II]], General [[Douglas MacArthur]]'s public insistence on the need to expand the [[Korean War]], over the objections of President [[Harry S. Truman]], led to [[Dismissal of General Douglas MacArthur|the termination]] of his [[Command (military formation)|command]].]]

Civilian leaders cannot usually hope to challenge their militaries by means of force, and thus must guard against any potential usurpation of powers through a combination of policies, laws, and the inculcation of the values of civilian control in their armed services. The presence of a distinct civilian [[police]] force, [[militia]], or other [[paramilitary]] group may mitigate to an extent the disproportionate strength that a country's military possesses; civilian [[gun]] ownership has also been justified on the grounds that it prevents potential abuses of power by authorities (military or otherwise). Opponents of gun control have cited the need for a [[Gun politics#Balance of power|balance of power]] in order to enforce the civilian control of the military.

===A civilian commander-in-chief===
The establishment of a civilian [[head of state]], [[head of government]] or other government figure as the military's [[commander-in-chief]] within the [[chain of command]] is one legal construct for the propagation of civilian control.

In the United States, [[Article One of the United States Constitution|Article I]] of the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] gives the [[United States Congress|Congress]] the power to [[Declaration of war|declare war]] (in the [[War Powers Clause]]), while [[Article Two of the United States Constitution|Article II]] of the Constitution establishes the [[President of the United States|President]] as the commander-in-chief.  Ambiguity over when the President could take military action without declaring war resulted in the [[War Powers Resolution]] of 1973.

American presidents have used the power to dismiss high-ranking officers as a means to assert policy and strategic control.  Three examples include [[Abraham Lincoln]]'s dismissal of [[George B. McClellan|George McClellan]] in the [[American Civil War]] when McClellan failed to pursue the [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] [[Army of Northern Virginia]] following the [[Battle of Antietam]], [[Harry S. Truman]] [[President Truman's relief of General Douglas MacArthur|relieving]] [[Douglas MacArthur]] of command in the [[Korean War]] after MacArthur repeatedly contradicted the Truman administration's stated policies on the war's conduct, and [[Barack Obama]]'s acceptance of [[Stanley A. McChrystal|Stanley McChrystal]]'s resignation in the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|War in Afghanistan]] after a ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' article was published where he mocked several members of the Obama administration, including [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Joe Biden]].

=== Composition of the military ===
Differing opinions exist as to the desirability of distinguishing the military as a body separate from the larger society. In ''The Soldier and the State'', [[Samuel P. Huntington|Huntington]] argued for what he termed "objective civilian control", "focus[ing] on a politically neutral, autonomous, and professional officer corps".&lt;ref name=Taylor /&gt; This autonomous professionalism, it is argued, best inculcates an [[esprit de corps]] and sense of distinct military corporateness that prevents political interference by sworn servicemen and -women. Conversely, the tradition of the [[citizen-soldier]] holds that "civilianizing" the military is the best means of preserving the loyalty of the armed forces towards civilian authorities, by preventing the development of an independent "[[caste]]" of warriors that might see itself as existing fundamentally apart from the rest of society. In the early history of the United States, according to Michael Cairo,
&lt;blockquote&gt;[the] principle of civilian control... embodied the idea that every qualified citizen was responsible for the defense of the nation and the defense of liberty, and would go to war, if necessary. Combined with the idea that the military was to embody democratic principles and encourage citizen participation, the only military force suitable to the Founders was a citizen [[militia]], which minimized divisions between officers and the enlisted.&lt;ref name=Cairo /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In a less [[egalitarian]] practice, societies may also blur the line between "civilian" and "military" leadership by making direct appointments of non-[[profession]]als (frequently social elites benefitting from [[patronage]] or [[nepotism]]) to an officer rank. A more invasive method, most famously practiced in the [[Soviet Union]] and [[People's Republic of China]], involves active monitoring of the [[Officer (armed forces)|officer corps]] through the appointment of [[political commissar]]s, posted parallel to the uniformed chain of command and tasked with ensuring that national policies are carried out by the armed forces. The regular [[job rotation|rotation]] of soldiers through a variety of different postings is another effective tool for reducing military autonomy, by limiting the potential for soldiers' attachment to any one particular [[military unit]]. Some governments place responsibility for approving [[promotion (rank)|promotions]] or officer candidacies with the civilian government, requiring some degree of deference on the part of [[Officer (armed forces)|officers]] seeking advancement through the ranks.

=== Technological developments ===
[[Image:Bombing in Vietnam.jpg|thumb|During the term of [[Lyndon B. Johnson]], the President and his advisors often chose specific [[bomb]]ing targets in [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]] on the basis of larger [[geopolitics|geopolitical]] calculations, without professional knowledge of the weapons or tactics. Apropos of LBJ's direction of the bombing campaign in Vietnam, no air warfare specialists attended the Tuesday lunches at which the targeting decisions were made.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history.navy.mil/colloquia/cch4c.htm "Washington's Management of the Rolling  Thunder Campaign"], M. Jacobsen, ''US Naval Historical Center Colloquium on Contemporary History Project''&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Historically, direct control over military forces deployed for war was hampered by the technological limits of [[command, control, and communications]]; national leaders, whether democratically elected or not, had to rely on local commanders to execute the details of a [[military campaign]], or risk centrally-directed orders' obsolescence by the time they reached the [[front lines]]. The remoteness of government from the action allowed [[professional soldier]]s to claim military affairs as their own particular sphere of expertise and influence; upon entering a state of war, it was often expected that the [[general]]s and [[field marshal]]s would dictate strategy and tactics, and the civilian leadership would defer to their informed judgments.

Improvements in [[information technology]] and its application to wartime [[Command and Control (Military)|command and control]] (a process sometimes labeled the "[[Revolution in Military Affairs]]") has allowed civilian leaders removed from the [[theater (military)|theater of conflict]] to assert greater control over the actions of distant military forces. [[Precision-guided munition]]s and real-time [[videoconferencing]] with field commanders now allow the civilian leadership to intervene even at the [[:wikt:tactical|tactical]] decision-making level, designating particular targets for destruction or preservation based on political calculations or the counsel of non-uniformed advisors.

=== Restrictions on Political Activities ===
In the United States the [[Hatch Act of 1939]] does not directly apply to the military, however, Department of Defense Directive 1344.10 (DoDD 1344.10) essentially applies the same rules to the military. This helps to ensure a non-partisan military and ensure smooth and peaceful transitions of power.

=== Political officers ===

{{main|political commissar}}

Political officers screened for appropriate ideology have been integrated into supervisory roles within militaries as a way to maintain the control by political rulers. Historically they are associated most strongly with the [[Soviet Union]] and [[China]] rather than liberal democracies.

== Military dislike of political directives ==

While civilian control forms the normative standard in almost every society outside of [[military dictatorship]]s, its practice has often been the subject of pointed criticism from both uniformed and non-uniformed observers, who object to what they view as the undue "politicization" of military affairs, especially when elected officials or political appointees micromanage the military, rather than giving the military general goals and objectives (like "Defeat Country X"), and letting the military decide how best to carry those orders out. By placing responsibility for military decision-making in the hands of non-professional civilians, critics argue, the dictates of military strategy are subsumed to the political, with the effect of unduly restricting the fighting capabilities of the nation's armed forces for what should be immaterial or otherwise lower priority concerns.

===Case study: United States===
The "[[Revolt of the Admirals]]" that occurred in 1949 was an attempt by senior US Navy personnel, to force a change in budgets directly opposed to the directives given by the Civilian leadership.

[[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Bill Clinton]] faced frequent allegations throughout his time in office (particularly after the [[Battle of Mogadishu (1993)|Battle of Mogadishu]]) that he was ignoring military goals out of political and media pressure—a phenomenon termed the "[[CNN effect]]". Politicians who personally lack military training and experience but who seek to engage the nation in military action may risk resistance and being labeled "[[chickenhawk (politics)|chickenhawks]]" by those who disagree with their political goals.

In contesting these priorities, members of the professional military leadership and their non-uniformed supporters may participate in the bureaucratic bargaining process of the state's policy-making apparatus, engaging in what might be termed a form of [[regulatory capture]] as they attempt to restrict the policy options of elected officials when it comes to military matters. An example of one such set of conditions is the "[[Weinberger doctrine|Weinberger Doctrine]]", which sought to forestall another American intervention like that which occurred in the [[Vietnam War]] (which had proved disastrous for the morale and fighting integrity of the [[Military of the United States|U.S. military]]) by proposing that the nation should only go to war in matters of "vital national interest", "as a last resort", and, as [[Powell Doctrine|updated]] by [[Caspar Weinberger|Weinberger]]'s disciple [[Colin Powell]], with "overwhelming force". The process of setting [[List of countries by military expenditures|military budgets]] forms another contentious intersection of military and non-military policy, and regularly draws active [[lobbying]] by rival military services for a share of the national budget.

Nuclear weapons in the U.S. are controlled by the civilian [[United States Department of Energy]], not by the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]].

During the 1990s and 2000s, public controversy over [[LGBT policy in the U.S. military]] led to many military leaders and personnel being asked for their opinions on the matter and being given deference although the decision was ultimately not theirs to make.

During his tenure, Secretary of Defense [[Donald Rumsfeld]] raised the ire of the military by attempting to reform its structure away from traditional infantry and toward a lighter, faster, more technologically driven force. In April 2006, Rumsfeld was severely criticized by some retired military officers for his handling of the [[Iraq War]], while other retired military officers came out in support of Rumsfeld. Although no active military officers have spoken out against Rumsfeld, the actions of these officers is still highly unusual. Some news accounts have attributed the actions of these generals to the [[Vietnam war]] experience, in which officers did not speak out against the administration's handling of military action. Later in the year, immediately after the November elections in which the Democrats gained control of the Congress, Rumsfeld resigned.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

However, without a formal conversion, many highly observant Jews will reject a convert's Jewish status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.convert.org/Movements_in_Judaism.html |title=www.convert.org |publisher=www.convert.org |date= |accessdate=2012-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are some groups that have adopted Jewish customs and practices. For example, in [[Russia]] the [[Subbotniks]] have adopted most aspects of Judaism without formal conversion to Judaism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.molokane.org/subbotniki/Russia/antifashist.html |title=Russian Saturday! |publisher=Molokane.org |date= |accessdate=2012-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, if Subbotniks, or anyone without a formal conversion, wish to marry into a traditional Jewish community or immigrate to Israel, they must have a formal conversion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jrtelegraph.com/2008/11/the-plight-of-subbotniks.html |title=www.jrtelegraph.com |publisher=www.jrtelegraph.com |date=25 November 2008 |accessdate=2012-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Terminology ==
{{Jews and Judaism sidebar |Culture}}
The word ''ger'' comes from the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] verb ''lagur'' (לגור) meaning "to reside" or "to sojourn [with]". In the [[Hebrew Bible]] ''ger'' is defined as a "foreigner", or "sojourner".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bibleencyclopedia.com/stranger.htm |title=Stranger |publisher=Bible Encyclopedia |date= |accessdate=2012-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rabbi Marc Angel writes:
{{quote|The Hebrew ''ger'' (in post-Biblical times translated as "proselyte") literally means "resident" and refers to a non-Israelite who lived among the [[Israelite]] community. When the Torah commands compassion and equal justice for the ''ger'', it is referring to these "residents". Rabbinic tradition interpreted the word ''ger'' as referring to proselytes..."&lt;ref&gt;Marc D. Angel (2005). "Choosing to Be Jewish", K'Tav Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Angel's explanation of the literal meaning of "''ger''" as alien is borne out in [[bible|biblical]] verses such as {{bibleverse||Lev|19:34|HE}}:
{{quote|The stranger that sojourneth with you shall be unto you as the home-born among you, and thou shalt love him as thyself; for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt: I am the LORD your God.}}

Another passage which may be relevant to a process of conversion involves non-Jewish women captured in war who could be adopted forcibly as wives ({{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|21:10–14|HE}}). Another verse which has been interpreted as referring to non-Jews converting to Judaism is Esther 8:17, although no process is described. ({{bibleverse||Esther|8:17|HE}}).

The word is rendered by the Greek "[[proselyte]]" as used in the [[Septuagint]] to denote a "stranger".{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}
A male convert to Judaism is referred to by the [[Hebrew]] word ''ger'' ({{lang-he|גר}}, plural ''gerim'') and a female convert is a ''giyoret''. In all branches of Judaism, a ger or giyoret is considered a full Jew, the literal meaning of "stranger," "resident," or "foreigner" refers to the convert's origin, not present status.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} In [[Karaite Judaism]] the term ''ger'' only refers to a non-Jew who has yet to fully convert to Judaism, and once converted to Karaitism, is no longer called ''ger''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.karaitejudaism.org/talks/Gerim_By_Eliezer_haKohen.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Talmud]], ''ger'' is used in two senses: ''ger tzedek'' refers to a "righteous convert", a proselyte to Judaism, and ''[[ger toshav]]'', a non-Jewish inhabitant of the Land of Israel who observes the [[Seven Laws of Noah]] and has repudiated all links with [[idolatry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.7for70.com/ |title=Ger Toshav – A Look at the Sources for Contemporary Application:A Proposal for Intermarried and other Allies in our Midst |publisher=7for70.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Modern Hebrew]], the unqualified term ''ger'' means ''ger tzedek''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://judaism.about.com/cs/conversion/f/ger.htm |title=Converts – Conversion to Judaism |publisher=Judaism.about.com |date=11 June 2009 |accessdate=2012-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
According to [[Maimonides]], (''Isurei Biah'' 13:14) converts were accepted since the beginning of Jewish history, and the foreign wives of Jewish leaders - such as [[Samson]] and [[Solomon]] - were converts. Yet he says (''Isurei Biah'' 13:15), that in the times of Jewish political power, such as the days of Kings [[David]] and [[Solomon]], ''[[Beth din|Batei Dinim]]'' (Jewish courts) did not accept converts, who may have not had the right intention, and they had to wait and prove their intentions to be legally accepted.&lt;ref name="Moments"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.myvirtualpaper.com/doc/flatbush-jewish-news/may_13_final/2010051301/18.html#6|title=Moments of Hisorerus|date=13 May 2010|accessdate=21 Nov 2011|work=Flatbush Jewish Journal|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150709094933/http://www.myvirtualpaper.com/doc/flatbush-jewish-news/may_13_final/2010051301/18.html#6|archive-date=9 July 2015|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nowadays, with the notable exception of some [[Syrian Jewish]] communities, (primarily the Brooklyn, NY and Deal, NJ communities),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/14/magazine/14syrians-t.html?_r=4&amp;ref=magazine&amp;oref=slogin&amp;oref=slogin|author=Chafets, Zev |work=The New York Times  |title=The Sy Empire |date=14 October 2007 |accessdate=2015-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; all mainstream forms of Judaism today are open to sincere converts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.myjewishlearning.com/ideas_belief/Jews_NonJews/NJ_Attitudes_TO/NJ_Proselytes.htm |title=Jewish Attitudes Toward Proselytes |publisher=My Jewish Learning |date= |accessdate=2012-07-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081006005206/http://www.myjewishlearning.com/ideas_belief/Jews_NonJews/NJ_Attitudes_TO/NJ_Proselytes.htm |archivedate=6 October 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; with all denominations accepting converts converted by their denominations. The rules vary between denominations, as does acceptance of some denomations' converts by other denominations.

For [[Rabbinic Judaism]], the laws governing conversion (''gerut'') are based on codes of law and texts, including discussions in the [[Talmud]], through the [[Shulkhan Arukh]] and subsequent interpretations. (Many of the guidelines of accepting converts are based on the [[Book of Ruth]] and the manner whereby [[Ruth (biblical figure)|Ruth]] was brought into the fold through her mother-in-law, [[Naomi (Bible)|Naomi]]).&lt;ref name="Moments"/&gt; These rules are held as authoritative by [[Orthodox Judaism]] and [[Conservative Judaism]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} 

Within Orthodoxy it is commonly understood that Halacha somewhat discourages [[proselytism|proselytizing]], and religious ''gerut'' is somewhat discouraged. Some rabbis reject potential converts three times, and if they remained adamant in their desire to convert, they would then allow them to begin the process.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt; These practices do not have any solid basis in the written text, and while they may have been the practice in some locations, it was not universal , and a number of rabbis have not followed these practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://rabbimichaelsamuel.com/2010/02/rabbi-ben-tsion-uziels-compassionate-but-pragmatic-approach-to-halacha/|title=Rabbi Ben Tsion Uziel’s Compassionate but Pragmatic Approach to Halacha «  Rabbi Michael Leo Samuel|website=rabbimichaelsamuel.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://blogs.timesofisrael.com/conversion-and-rabbinic-incompetence-a-response-to-rabbi-chaim-navon/|title=Conversion and Rabbinic incompetence – a response to Rabbi Chaim Navon|work=The Times of Israel|access-date=2018-03-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to convert, the conversion candidate must have a circumcision (males) and immerse in the mikveh before a kosher beth din, comprising 3 Jewish males who are [[shomer Shabbat]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; There is also a requirement to accept the commandments (although not necessarily a commitment to keep the mitzvot), although without this step there are many authorities who will accept the conversion as valid. In the past it is likely that conversions happened like this, and were decentralized, and universally accepted once performed.

Today, the process has become more centralized, with the conversion candidate having to convince a rabbi and the beth din of their sincerity, and there will usually be a considerable amount of study. They will then be tested and formally accepted, the convert is issued with a ''Shtar geirut'' ("Certificate of Conversion").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arthistoryclub.com/art_history/Who_Is_A_Jew%3F |title=Who is a Jew? – Art History Online Reference and Guide |publisher=Arthistoryclub.com |date=29 January 2012 |accessdate=2012-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the conversion process becomes more centralized there are only a limited number of conversion courts that are 'acceptable' to the Chief Rabbinate of Israel.

However there are a number of rabbis who are willing to conduct decentralized conversions today, and are recognized by each other. Two of the more prominent of these rabbis are [[Chuck Davidson]] and [[Haim Amsalem]].

[[Conservative Judaism]] takes a more lenient approach in application of the ''halakhic'' rules than [[Modern Orthodox Judaism]]. Its approach to the validity of conversions is based on whether the conversion procedure followed rabbinic norms, rather than the reliability of those performing it or the nature of the obligations the convert undertook.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} Accordingly, it may accept the validity of some [[Reform Judaism|Reform]] and [[Reconstructionist Judaism|Reconstructionist]] conversions, but only if they include immersion in a ritual bath ([[mikvah]]), appearance before a rabbinical court ([[beit din]]) and, for men, circumcision (''brit milah'') or a symbolic circumcision for those already circumcised (''hatafat dam brit'').{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}

The requirements of [[Reform Judaism]] for conversions are different. The denomination states that "people considering conversion are expected to study Jewish theology, rituals, history, culture and customs, and to begin incorporating Jewish practices into their lives. The length and format of the course of study will vary from rabbi to rabbi and community to community, though most now require a course in basic Judaism and individual study with a rabbi, as well as attendance at services and participation in home practice and synagogue life."

Although an infant conversion might be accepted in some circumstances (such as in the case of adopted children or children whose parents convert), children who convert would typically be asked if they want to remain Jewish after reaching religious adulthood – which is 12 years of age for a girl and 13 for a boy. This standard is applied by Orthodox and Conservative Judaism, which accept [[halakha]] as binding.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, George. Essential Judaism: A Complete Guide to Beliefs, Customs and Rituals. New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 2000. {{ISBN|0-671-03480-4}}, pgs 229–232.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.shamash.org/lists/scj-faq/HTML/faq/02-03.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19961018021028/http://shamash.org/lists/scj-faq/HTML/faq/02-03.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=1996-10-18 |title=What is Conservative Judaism? |publisher=Shamash.org |date= |accessdate=2012-07-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Reconstructionist Judaism]] values the symbolism of the conversion ritual, and encourages those who were not born of Jewish parents and who wish to convert to undergo this rite of passage. The Reconstructionist course of study for a prospective convert, which is determined by the rabbi and congregation the individual is working with, includes history, observance and beliefs, and learning how to make educated choices. The completion of the process is marked by ritual immersion for men and women; circumcision or hatafat dam brit (symbolic drop of blood) for men (unless there exists an extraordinary physical or emotional hazard); a Bet Din (a dialogue with three knowledgeable Jews, at least one of whom is a rabbi), and often a public welcoming ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishrecon.org/resource/faqs-reconstructionist-approaches-jewish-ideas-and-practices|title=FAQs on Reconstructionist Approaches to Jewish Ideas and Practices|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Karaite Judaism]] does not accept Rabbinic Judaism and has different requirements for conversion. Traditionally non-proselytizing, Karaite Judaism's long standing abstention from conversions was recently lifted. On 1 August 2007, the Karaites reportedly converted their first new members in 500 years. At a ceremony in their Northern California synagogue, ten adults and four minors swore fealty to Judaism after completing a year of study. This conversion comes 15 years after the Karaite Council of Sages reversed its centuries-old ban on accepting converts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jta.org/cgi-bin/iowa/breaking/103393.html Karaites hold first conversion in 500 years] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081011151023/http://www.jta.org/cgi-bin/iowa/breaking/103393.html |date=11 October 2008 }}. 2 August 2007, JTA Breaking News.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Requirements==
The [[Amoraim]] who produced the [[Talmud]] set out three requirements for a [[religious conversion|conversion]] to Judaism ([[Keritot]] 8b), which must be witnessed and affirmed by a ''[[beth din]] hedyot'' rabbinical court composed of three Jewish males above the age of thirteen (they do not need to be rabbis):{{Original research inline|date=September 2009}}
* [[Circumcision in the Bible|Circumcision]] (''[[Brit milah]]'' or ''[[hatafat dam brit]]'') for men&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt;
* Immersion (''[[tevilah]]'') in a ritual bath (''[[mikveh]]'') for both men and women&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt;
* Offering a certain sacrifice ([[korban]]) in the Temple (the [[Beit Hamikdash]]) – this requirement is deferred while the Temple does not exist until such time as it may be rebuilt.

The consensus of ''halakhic'' authorities also requires a convert to understand and accept the duties of the classical [[Halakha|Jewish law]]. This is not stated explicitly in the Talmud, but was inferred by subsequent [[Rishonim|commentators]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/Conversion.html |title=Conversion |publisher=Jewishvirtuallibrary.org |date= |accessdate=2012-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After confirming that all these requirements have been met, the ''beth din'' issues a "Certificate of Conversion" (''Shtar Giur''), certifying that the person is now a Jew.

==Early debate on requirement for circumcision==
According to the [[Jewish Encyclopedia]] article on circumcision of [[proselytes]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=514&amp;letter=C&amp;search=circumcision#1789 |title=Circumcision" Circumcision of Proselytes |publisher=Jewish Encyclopedia |date= |accessdate=2012-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the 1st century [[Common Era|CE]], before the [[Mishnah]] was edited, the requirement for circumcision of [[proselytes]] was an open issue between the [[zealot]]s and liberal parties in ancient Israel. [[Joshua ben Hananiah|R. Joshua]] argued that besides accepting Jewish beliefs and laws, a prospective convert to Judaism must undergo immersion in a [[mikvah|mikveh]]. In contrast, [[R. Eliezer]] makes circumcision a condition for the conversion. A similar controversy between the [[Shammai]]tes and the [[Hillel the Elder|Hillelites]] is given regarding a proselyte [[Aposthia|born without a foreskin]]: the former demanding the spilling of a drop of blood symbolic of the Brit Milah, thereby entering into the covenant; the latter declaring it to be unnecessary.&lt;ref&gt;Babylonian Talmud, Shabbat 135a and Gerim 2:2, cited in The Way of the Boundary Crosser: An Introduction to Jewish Flexidoxy. Lanham, MD: Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2005. 214-19.&lt;/ref&gt;

In discussions about the necessity of circumcision for those born of a Jewish mother, lending some support to the need for circumcision of converts, the [[Midrash]] states: "If thy sons accept My Godhead [by undergoing circumcision] I shall be their God and bring them into the land; but if they do not observe My covenant in regard either to circumcision or to the [[Shabbat|Sabbath]], they shall not enter the [[Promised Land|land of promise]]" ([[Midrash]] Genesis Rabbah xlvi). "The [[Godfearers|Sabbath-keepers who are not circumcised]] are intruders, and deserve punishment," ([[Midrash]] Deut. Rabbah i).

However, the opposing view is supported in the [[Babylonian Talmud]]: "A male convert who has been immersed but not circumcised, or circumcised but not immersed, is a convert."&lt;ref&gt;Babylonian Talmud, Yevamot 46a and Gerim 1:6, cited in The Way of the Boundary Crosser: An Introduction to Jewish Flexidoxy. Lanham, MD: Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2005. 214-19&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Flavius Josephus]] in [[Jewish Antiquities]] Book 20 Chapter 2 recorded the story of [[Izates bar Monobaz|King Izates]] of [[Adiabene]] who decided to follow the [[613 Mitzvot|Law of Moses]] at the advice of a Jewish merchant named Ananias. He was going to get circumcised, but his mother, Helen, who herself embraced the Jewish customs, advised against it on the grounds that the subjects would not stand to be ruled by someone who followed such "strange and foreign rites". Ananias likewise advised against it, on the grounds that worship of God was superior to circumcision ([[Robert Eisenman]] in ''James the Brother of Jesus'' claims that Ananias is [[Paul of Tarsus]] who held similar views, although this is a novel interpretation lacking support in mainstream scholarship) and that God would forgive him for fear of his subjects. So Izates decided against it. However, later, "a certain other Jew that came out of Galilee, whose name was Eleazar", who was well versed in the Law, convinced him that he should, on the grounds that it was one thing to read the Law and another thing to practice it, and so he did. Once Helen and Ananias found out, they were struck by great fear of the possible consequences, but as Josephus put it, God looked after Izates. As his reign was peaceful and blessed, Helen visited the Jerusalem Temple to thank God, and since there was a terrible famine at the time, she brought lots of food and aid to the people of Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;Josephus F, Retrieved 2011-1-20 [http://sacred-texts.com/jud/josephus/ant-20.htm Book 20 Chapter 2]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern practice==
The requirements for conversions vary somewhat within the different branches of Judaism, so whether or not a conversion is recognized by another denomination is often an issue fraught with religious politics. The Orthodox rejection of non-Orthodox conversions is derived less from qualms with the conversion process itself, since Conservative and even some Reform conversions are ostensibly very similar to Orthodox conversions with respect to duration and content, but rather from that the convert was presumably not properly (i.e. according to tradition) instructed in Jewish Law, and the procedure of conversion has a chance of not having been done properly, and that those overseeing the process were (almost certainly) not qualified to test the convert (and in any case would have had different answers).{{Original research inline|date=September 2009}}

In general, immersion in the mikveh is an important part of a traditional conversion. If the person who is converting is male, [[circumcision]] is a part of the traditional conversion process as well. If the male who is converting has already been circumcised, then a ritual removal of a single drop of blood will take place (''hatafat dam brit'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.convert.org/Conversion_Process.html |title=concert.org: THE CONVERSION PROCESS |publisher=Convert.org |date= |accessdate=2012-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, more liberal branches of Judaism have a more relaxed requirement of immersion and circumcision.

==Maturity==
Someone who was converted to Judaism as a child has an option of rejecting this after reaching the age of maturity, which in Judaism is age twelve for girls or thirteen for boys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.convert.org/Converting_Infants.html |title=Conversion to Judaism Resource Center |publisher=Convert.org |date= |accessdate=2012-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reform Jewish views==
In the United States of America, [[Reform Judaism]] rejects the concept that any rules or rituals should be considered necessary for conversion to Judaism. In the late 19th century, the [[Central Conference of American Rabbis]], the official body of American Reform rabbis, formally resolved to permit the admission of converts "without any initiatory rite, ceremony, or observance whatsoever". (CCAR Yearbook 3 (1893), 73–95; ''American Reform Responsa'' (ARR), no. 68, at 236–237.)

Although this resolution has often been examined critically by many Reform rabbis, the resolution still remains the official policy of American Reform Judaism (CCAR Responsa "Circumcision for an Eight-Year-Old Convert" 5756.13 and [[Solomon Freehof]], ''Reform Responsa for Our Time'', no. 15.) Thus, American Reform Judaism does not require ritual immersion in a mikveh, circumcision, or acceptance of mitzvot as normative. Appearance before a [[Bet Din]] is recommended, but is not considered necessary. Converts are asked to commit to religious standards set by the local Reform community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reformjudaism.org/choosing-judaism-0 |title=Choosing Judaism |publisher=ReformJudaism.org |date= |accessdate=2015-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In actual practice, the requirements for conversion of any individual are determined by the Rabbi who sponsors the convert. Typically, Reform Rabbis require prospective converts to take a course of study in Judaism, such as an "Introduction to Judaism" course, to participate in worship at a synagogue, and to live as a Jew (however that is interpreted by the individual Rabbi) for a period of time. A period of one year is common, although individual Rabbis' requirements vary. When the sponsoring Rabbi feels that the candidate is ready, a Bet Din may be convened. Other rituals such as immersion in a mikvah, circumcision (or [[Hatafat dam brit]]), and a public ceremony to celebrate the conversion, are also at the discretion of the Rabbi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reformjudaism.org/choosing-judaism-0|title=Choosing Judaism|work=Reform Judaism}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sanghani|first1=Radhika|title=Zooey Deschanel is Jewish.

==Interdenominational views==
In response to the tremendous variations that exist within the Reform community, the Conservative Jewish movement attempted to set a nuanced approach. The Conservative [[Committee on Jewish Law and Standards]] has issued a [[responsum|legal opinion]] stating that Reform conversions may be accepted as valid only when they include the minimal Conservative halachic requirements of [[milah]] and [[Tvilah|t'vilah]], appearance before a Conservative Bet Din, and a course of Conservative study. (''Proceedings of Committee on Jewish Law and Standards: 1980–1985'', pp.&amp;nbsp;77–101.)

In general, branches of Orthodox Judaism consider non-Orthodox conversions either inadequate or of questionable halachic compliance, and such conversions are therefore not accepted by these branches of Judaism. Conversely, both Conservative and Reform Judaism accept the stringent Orthodox conversion process as being valid. Since 2008, Haredi Orthodox religious courts in Israel have been rejecting conversions even from some other Orthodox rabbis, in addition to Reform and Conservative conversions, as not being stringent enough.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3538630,00.html |title=Thousands of conversions questioned - Israel Jewish Scene, Ynetnews |publisher=Ynetnews.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Intra-Orthodox controversy==
{{update|date=August 2016}}
In 2008, a Haredi-dominated [[Badatz]] in Israel annulled thousands of conversions performed by the [[Military Rabbinate]] in Israel. The [[Chief Rabbinate of Israel]], which is the only state-recognized authority on religious matters, backed by Rabbi [[Ovadia Yosef]], ruled against this, making it legally invalid for purposes of Israeli law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3538630,00.html |title=Conversions, The Chief Rabbis And The RCA |publisher=Ynetnews.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Canadian Orthodox program==
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2016}}
There are two orthodox conversion programmes in [[Montreal]]. One is made up of a ''Bet Din'' (Jewish Court) of congregational member rabbis from the Rabbinical Council of America, Montreal region (RCA). This program provides a way to convert according to the rigorous rules of Halachah while making the process more "user friendly" for non-Jewish individuals seeking a more "hands-on" or "modern Orthodox" approach. The second program is supervised by the Jewish Community Council of Montreal, the ''Vaad Hair''.

All conversion candidates—who could include singles, non-Jewish couples and adoption cases—must have a sponsoring rabbi and undergo a rigorous screening process. Conversions stemming from both programs are recognized in Israel and around the world.

==Karaite views==
As of 2006, the ''Moetzet Hakhamim'' (Council of Sages) began to accept converts to [[Karaite Judaism]] through the [[Karaite Jewish University]]. The process requires one year of learning, circumcision (for males), and the taking of the vow that Ruth took.

==Attempts to resolve the "Who is a Jew?" issue==
{{Main|Who is a Jew?}}

===1950s: proposed joint beth din===
In the 1950s Rabbi [[Joseph Soloveitchik]] and other members of the [[Rabbinical Council of America]] engaged in a series of private negotiations with the leaders of Conservative Judaism's [[Rabbinical Assembly]], including [[Saul Lieberman]]; their goal was to create a joint Orthodox-Conservative national beth din for all Jews in the United States. It would create communal standards of marriage and divorce. It was to be modeled after the Israeli Chief Rabbinate, where all the judges would have been Orthodox, while it would have been accepted by the larger Conservative movement as legitimate. Conservative rabbis in the Rabbinical Assembly created a ''Joint Conference on Jewish Law'', devoting a year to this effort.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

For a number of reasons, the project did not succeed. According to Orthodox Rabbi Louis Bernstein, the major reason for its failure was the Orthodox rabbis' insistence that the Conservative Rabbinical Assembly agree to expel Conservative rabbis for actions they took prior to the formation of the new beth din, and the RA refused to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Bernstein|first=Louis|title=The Emergence of the English Speaking Orthodox Rabbinate|publisher=Yeshiva University|year=1977}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Orthodox Rabbi [[Emanuel Rackman]], former president of the RCA, the major reason for its failure was pressure from [[haredi]] Orthodox rabbis, who held that any cooperation between Orthodoxy and Conservatism was forbidden. In 1956, Rabbi [[Harry Halpern]], of the ''Joint Conference'' wrote a report on the demise of this beth din. He writes that negotiations between the Orthodox and Conservative denominations were completed and agreed upon, but then a new requirement was demanded by the RCA: The RA must "impose severe sanctions" upon Conservative rabbis for actions they took before this new beth din was formed. Halpern writes that the RA "could not assent to rigorously disciplining our members at the behest of an outside group". He goes on to write that although subsequent efforts were made to cooperate with the Orthodox, a letter from eleven [[Rosh yeshiva|Rosh Yeshivas]] was circulated declaring that Orthodox rabbis are forbidden to cooperate with Conservative rabbis.&lt;ref&gt;Proceedings of the CJLS of the Conservative Movement 1927–1970 Vol. II, p.850-852.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1978–1983: Denver program, patrilineal descent ===
In [[Denver]], [[Colorado]], a joint Orthodox, Traditional, Conservative and Reform Bet Din was formed to promote uniform standards for conversion to Judaism. A number of rabbis were Orthodox and had ''semicha'' from Orthodox yeshivas, but were serving in synagogues without a [[mechitza]]; these synagogues were called ''traditional Judaism''. Over a five-year period they performed some 750 conversions to Judaism. However, in 1983 the joint Beth Din was dissolved, due to the unilateral American Reform Jewish decision to change the definition of Jewishness.&lt;ref name="Wertheimer, A People Divided"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Wertheimer|first=Jack|title=A People Divided: Judaism in Contemporary America|publisher=University Press of New England|year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quotation|The move was precipitated by the resolution on patrilineality adopted that year by the Central Conference of American Rabbis. This decision to redefine Jewish identity, as well as the designation of Denver as a pilot community for a new Reform out reach effort to recruit converts, convinced the Traditional and Conservative rabbis that they could no longer participate in the joint board...the national decision of the Reform rabbinate placed the Traditional and Conservative rabbis in an untenable position. They could not cooperate in a conversion program with rabbis who held so different a conception of Jewish identity. And furthermore, they could not supervise conversions that would occur with increasing frequency due to a Reform outreach effort that was inconsistent with their own understanding of how to relate to potential proselytes.|Wertheimer|A People Divided|&lt;ref name="Wertheimer, A People Divided" /&gt;}}

Specifically, in 1983, the [[Central Conference of American Rabbis]] passed a resolution waiving the need for formal conversion for anyone with at least one Jewish parent who has made affirmative acts of Jewish identity. This departed from the traditional position requiring formal conversion to Judaism for children without a [[matrilineal descent|Jewish mother]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/patrilineal1.html Reform Movement's Resolution on Patrilineal Descent]&lt;/ref&gt; The 1983 resolution of the American Reform movement has had a mixed reception in Reform Jewish communities outside of the United States. Most notably, the [[Israel Movement for Progressive Judaism]] has rejected patrilineal descent and requires formal conversion for anyone without a Jewish mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ajc.org/site/apps/nl/content3.asp?c=ijITI2PHKoG&amp;b=840313&amp;ct=1051515|title=The Establishment of Reform Judaism in Israel|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304114546/http://www.ajc.org/site/apps/nl/content3.asp?c=ijITI2PHKoG&amp;b=840313&amp;ct=1051515|archivedate=4 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 2015 the majority of Britain's Assembly of Reform Rabbis voted in favor of a position paper proposing "that individuals who live a Jewish life, and who are patrilineally Jewish, can be welcomed into the Jewish community and confirmed as Jewish through an individual process".&lt;ref name="jpost1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Lewis |first=Jerry |url=http://www.jpost.com/Diaspora/UK-Reform-rabbis-accept-patrilineal-descent-409298 |title=UK Reform rabbis accept patrilineal descent - Diaspora - Jerusalem Post |publisher=Jpost.com |date= |accessdate=2015-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Britain's Assembly of Reform Rabbis stated that rabbis "would be able to take local decisions – ratified by the [[Beit Din]] – confirming Jewish status".&lt;ref name="jpost1"/&gt;

The end of the joint Beth Din program was welcomed by Haredi Orthodox groups, who saw the program as illegitimate. Further, Haredi groups attempted to prevent non-Orthodox rabbis from following the traditional requirements of converts using a mikveh. In the Haredi view, it is better to have no conversion at all than a non-Orthodox conversion, as all non-Orthodox conversions are not true conversions at all according to them.&lt;ref&gt;''Fifth Anniversary of the Mikveh of East Denver'', Hillel Goldberg&lt;/ref&gt;

===1980s: proposed Israeli joint ''beth din''===
In the 1980s Orthodox Rabbi [[Norman Lamm]], Rosh Yeshiva of [[Yeshiva University]], along with other American and Israeli Orthodox rabbis, worked with Conservative and Reform rabbis to come up with solution to the "Who is a Jew?" issue. In 1989 and 1990 Israeli Prime Minister [[Yitzhak Shamir]] spearheaded an effort to find a way to resolve the impasse.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

A plan was developed by Israeli Cabinet Secretary [[Elyakim Rubenstein]], who negotiated secretly for many months with rabbis from Conservative, Reform and Orthodox Judaism, including faculty at Yeshiva University, with Lamm as ''Rosh Yeshiva''. They were planning to create a joint panel that interviewed people who were converting to Judaism and considering making ''aliyah'' (moving to the State of Israel), and would refer them to a beth din that would convert the candidate following traditional halakha. All negotiating parties came to agreement:{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}
# Conversions must be carried out according to halakha
# the ''beth din'' (rabbinic court) overseeing the conversion would be Orthodox, perhaps appointed by the Chief Rabbinate of Israel, and
# there would be three-way dialogue throughout the process.

Many Reform rabbis took offense at the notion that the ''beth din'' must be strictly halakhic and Orthodox, but they acquiesced. However, when word about this project became public, a number of leading haredi rabbis issued a statement denouncing the project, condemning it as a "travesty of halakha". Rabbi Moshe Sherer, Chairman of Agudath Israel World Organization, stated that "Yes we played a role in putting an end to that farce, and I'm proud we did". Norman Lamm condemned this interference by Sherer, stating that this was "the most damaging thing that he [Sherer] ever did in his forty year career".&lt;ref name="Landau"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Landau|first=David|title=Piety &amp; Power|publisher=Hill &amp; Wang|year=1993|page=320}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rabbi Lamm wanted this to be only the beginning of a solution to Jewish disunity. He stated that had this unified conversion plan not been destroyed, he wanted to extend this program to the area of halakhic Jewish divorces, thus ending the problem of ''mamzerut''.&lt;ref name="Landau" /&gt;

===1997: Neeman Commission proposal===
In 1997 the issue of "Who is a Jew?" again arose in the [[State of Israel]], and Orthodox leaders such as Rabbi [[Norman Lamm]] publicly backed the Neeman commission, a group of Orthodox, Conservative and Reform rabbis working to develop joint programs for conversion to Judaism. In 1997 Lamm gave a speech at the World Council of Orthodox Leadership, in Glen Springs, N.Y., urging Orthodox Jews to support this effort.

{{quote|Lamm told his listeners that they should value and encourage the efforts of non-Orthodox leaders to more seriously integrate traditional Jewish practices into the lives of their followers. They should welcome the creation of Reform and Conservative day schools and not see them as a threat to their own, Lamm said. In many communities, Orthodox day schools, or Orthodox-oriented community day schools, have large numbers of students from non-Orthodox families. The liberal movements should be appreciated and encouraged because they are doing something Jewish, even if it is not the way that Orthodox Jews would like them to, he said. "What they are doing is something, and something is better than nothing," he said in his speech. "I'm very openly attacking the notion that we sometimes find in the Orthodox community that 'being a goy is better{{'"}} than being a non-Orthodox Jew, he said in an interview.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Orthodox leader speaks out on Jewish unity, breaking long silence|last=Nussbaum Cohen|first=Debra|date=5 December 1997|publisher=Jewish Telegraphic Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}The committee recommended the establishment of a joint institute for Jewish studies, which would be a joint effort by all three streams of Judaism. The Committee also recommended that conversion proceedings themselves be held in special conversion courts, to be recognized by all denominations in Judaism. The purpose of the proposal was to prevent a rift in the Jewish people, while at the same time bringing about a state-sponsored arrangement for conversion. On September 7, 1998, the government adopted the Ne'eman Commission Report.

A year later, the Joint Institute for Jewish Studies was established, and since then it has been the official state operator of conversion courses in Israel, including the military conversion courses. In 2015 the institute's name was changed to Nativ – The National Center for Jewish Studies, Identity and Conversion.

===Conversion annulments===
A recent development has been the concept of annulling conversions to Judaism, sometimes many years after they have taken place, due to a reduction in religious observance or change of community by the convert. This is unknown in rabbinic literature, where conversion is considered irreversible. [[Chuck Davidson]], a Modern Orthodox expert on this conversion crisis explains "From the Middle Ages onwards, the greatest of the rabbis wrote explicitly that even if immediately after the conversion the convert goes off to worship idols, the person is still considered Jewish".&lt;ref name="timesofisrael.com"&gt;{{cite news|first=Amanda |last=Borschel-Dan |title=Top court backs rabbis who revoked conversion over secular lifestyle: Israeli justices decide rabbis had the right to cancel Yonit Erez’s conversion two years after she became Jewish|date= 18 December 2014|work= [[Times of Israel]]|url= http://www.timesofisrael.com/top-court-backs-rabbis-who-revoked-conversion-over-secular-lifestyle/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The justification given for the change in approach is that the original conversion must never have been valid in the first place as it is clear from the convert's subsequent actions they were insincere at the time of conversion.

A situation of confusion and instability in Jewish identity in Israel was made worse when Haredi Rabbi Avraham Sherman of Israel's supreme religious court called into question the validity of over 40,000 Jewish conversions when he upheld a ruling by the Ashdod Rabbinical Court to retroactively annul the conversion of a woman who came before them because in their eyes she failed to observe Jewish law (an orthodox lifestyle).&lt;ref&gt;A Tragic Annulment, Jerusalem Report, September 2008: {{cite web|url=http://huc.edu/news/08/8/A%20Tragic%20Annulment.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-09-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527181434/http://www.huc.edu/news/08/8/A%20Tragic%20Annulment.pdf |archivedate=27 May 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cancelled Conversion: Center for Women's Justice, Israel. {{cite web|url=http://www.cwj.org.il/press/rivka-ynet-articles/cancelled-conversion |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-09-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324035026/http://www.cwj.org.il/press/rivka-ynet-articles/cancelled-conversion |archivedate=24 March 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This crisis deepened, when Israel's Rabbinate called into question the validity of soldiers who had undergone conversion in the army, meaning a soldier killed in action could not be buried according to Jewish law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thejewishweek.com/news/israel/amar_calls_netanyahu_quash_military_conversion_bill |title=Amar Calls on Netanyahu to Quash Military Conversion Bill |publisher=The Jewish Week |date=1 December 2010 |accessdate=2012-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, the rabbinate created a further distrust in the conversion process when it began refusing to recognize orthodox converts from the United States as Jewish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mandel |first=Jonah |url=http://www.jpost.com/JewishWorld/JewishNews/Article.aspx?id=216218 |title=‘National religious rabbis ... JPost - Jewish World - Jewish News |publisher=Jpost.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, the great-niece of the renowned Zionist [[Nahum Sokolow]] was recently deemed "not Jewish enough" to marry in Israel, after she failed to prove the purity of Jewish blood for four generations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=[[Ha'aretz]]|title= Sokolow's niece not 'Jewish' enough to get married here|url= http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/sokolow-s-niece-not-jewish-enough-to-marry-here-1.304882}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following a scandal in which U.S. Rabbi [[Barry Freundel]] was arrested on charges of installing hidden cameras in a mikveh to film women converts undressing, the Israeli Chief Rabbinate said it would review the validity of all past conversions performed by Freundel, then quickly reversed its decision, clarifying that it was joining the Orthodox [[Rabbinical Council of America]] in affirming the validity of the conversions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=[[Jewish Telegraphic Agency|JTA]] |title=Rabbi Freundel Conversions Are Valid, Israeli Chief Rabbinate Says|date= 21 October 2014|via= [[The Forward|Jewish Daily Forward]] |url=http://forward.com/articles/207698/rabbi-freundel-conversions-are-valid-israeli-chief/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2014 an Israeli court decided that a conversion could be annulled. In his decision Justice Neal Hendel wrote: "Just as the civil court has the inalienable authority to reverse — in extremely rare cases — a final judgment, so too does the special religious conversion court. For otherwise, we would allow for judgments that are flawed from their inception to exist eternally."&lt;ref name="timesofisrael.com"/&gt;

==Consequences==
Once undergone, a valid religious conversion to Judaism cannot be overturned. However, a Beth Din may determine that the conversion is void as it was never undertaken correctly in the first place. For example, if the rite of mikveh was performed incorrectly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QKxvMujgKfQC&amp;pg=PA49 |title=Conversion to Judaism in Jewish law ... – Google Books |publisher=Books.google.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years many Orthodox conversions have been overturned. In 2008 Israel's highest religious court invalidated the conversion of 40,000 Jews, mostly from Russian immigrant families, even though they had been approved by an Orthodox rabbi.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/07/us/strains-grow-between-israel-and-many-jews-in-the-us.html Strains Grow Between Israel and Many Jews in the U.S.] ''New York Times'', 6 Feb 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Debate on what constitutes a valid Beth Din for conversion and for annulling conversions has caused divisions in the Orthodox world. It is an implicit judgment on the character and uprightness of the rabbis in that religious court. For example, when Rabbi [[Barry Freundel]] was arrested on charges of voyeurism for filming women converts at the mikveh he supervised, Israel's Chief Rabbinate initially threatened to review and possibly invalidate the conversions Freundel had been involved in approving. A crisis between American and Israeli rabbis was averted when the Chief Rabbinate agreed that all conversions completed by Freundel would be considered valid.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/10/22/barry-freundel-conversions_n_6023906.html Conversions Performed By Barry Freundel, Rabbi Arrested For Voyeurism, Still Legitimate: Israel Rabbinate], Huffington Post, 22 Oct 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relations between Jews and proselytes===
Judaism is not currently an openly proselytizing religion. Judaism teaches that the righteous of all nations have a place in the [[Jewish eschatology#Olam Haba - the afterlife and the world to come|afterlife]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.religionfacts.com/judaism/beliefs/afterlife.htm |title=Jewish Beliefs on the Afterlife – ReligionFacts |publisher=Religionfacts.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much like in the other Abrahamic faiths, Jewish law requires the sincerity of a potential convert, but takes it to a much more serious and formal level. In view of the foregoing considerations, most authorities are very careful about it. Essentially, they want to be sure that the convert knows what they are getting into, and that they are doing it for sincerely religious reasons. However, while conversion for the sake of love for Judaism is considered the best motivation, a conversion for the sake of avoiding intermarriage is gaining acceptance also.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QKxvMujgKfQC&amp;pg=PA164 |title=Conversion to Judaism in Jewish law ... – Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a tradition that a prospective convert should be turned away three times as a test of sincerity, though most rabbis no longer follow the tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/judaism/beliefs/conversion.shtml |title=BBC – Converting to Judaism |date=20 July 2006 |accessdate=2008-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neither the [[Rabbinical Council of America]] nor the [[Rabbinical Assembly]], the leading American [[Orthodox Jews|Orthodox]] and [[Conservative Jews|Conservative]] organizations suggest taking this action in their conversion policies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://huc.edu/news/08/8/A%20Tragic%20Annulment.pdf |format=PDF |title=Geirus Policies and Standards that will Govern The Network of Regional Batei Din for Conversion |date=30 April 2007 |accessdate=2008-09-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527181434/http://www.huc.edu/news/08/8/A%20Tragic%20Annulment.pdf |archivedate=27 May 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rabbinicalassembly.org/law/conversion_resources.html |title=Rabbinical Assembly: conversion resources |accessdate=2008-09-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080527163941/http://www.rabbinicalassembly.org/law/conversion_resources.html |archivedate=27 May 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; with the [[Central Conference of American Rabbis]] (CCAR) and [[Union for Reform Judaism]] (URJ) actively opposing its practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ccarnet.org/Articles/index.cfm?id=215&amp;pge_prg_id=3818&amp;pge_id=1637 |title=CCAR: Guidelines for Rabbis Working with Prospective Gerim |date=2 February 2005 |accessdate=2008-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://urj.org/outreach/conversion/qa/ |title=Union for Reform Judaism – Converting to Judaism: Questions and Answers |accessdate=2008-09-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20051018001058/http://urj.org/outreach/conversion/qa/ |archivedate=18 October 2005 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Halakhic considerations===
Halakha forbids the mistreatment of a convert,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rabbihorowitz.com/PYes/ArticleDetails.cfm?Book_ID=636&amp;ThisGroup_ID=292&amp;Type=Article |title=RabbiHorowitz.com |publisher=RabbiHorowitz.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; including reminding a convert that he or she was once not a [[Jew]].{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} Hence, little to no distinction is made in Judaism between those who are born Jewish and those who are Jewish as a result of conversion. However, despite Halakha protecting the rights of converts, some Jewish communities have been accused of treating converts as second-class Jews. For example, many communities of [[Syrian Jews]] have banned conversion and refuse to recognise any Jewish conversion, including those done under Orthodox auspices (possibly influenced by sects in Syria like the [[Druze]] which do not accept converts).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/14/magazine/14syrians-t.html?_r=3&amp;ref=magazine&amp;oref=slogin&amp;oref=slogin |work=The New York Times |title=The Sy Empire |first=Zev |last=Chafets |date=14 October 2007 |accessdate=2010-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] interpretations of [[Halakha]], converts face a limited number of restrictions. A marriage between a female convert and a [[kohen]] (members of the priestly class) is prohibited and any children of the union do not inherit their father's kohen status. While a Jew by birth may not marry a [[mamzer]], a convert can.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-english.tamu.edu/pers/fac/myers/lindemann_debate.html Lindemann vs. Myers&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216072124/http://www-english.tamu.edu/pers/fac/myers/lindemann_debate.html |date=16 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Converts can become rabbis. For instance, [[Rabbi Meir]] Baal Ha Nes is thought to be a descendant of a proselyte. [[Rabbi Akiva]] was also a very well known son of converts. The Talmud lists many of the Jewish nation's greatest leaders who had either descended from or were themselves converts. In fact, [[King David]] is descended from [[Book of Ruth|Ruth]], a convert to Judaism.({{bibleverse||Ruth|4:13–22|HE}}) In Orthodox and Conservative communities which maintain tribal distinctions, converts become ''Yisraelim'' (Israelites), ordinary Jews with no tribal or inter-Jewish distinctions. Converts typically follow the customs of their congregations. So a convert who prays at a [[Sephardi]] synagogue would follow Sephardi customs and learn Sephardi Hebrew.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

A convert chooses his or her own Hebrew first name upon conversion but is traditionally known as the son or daughter of Abraham and Sarah, the first patriarch and matriarch in the Torah, often with the additional qualifier of "Avinu" (our father) and "Imenu" (our mother). Hence, a convert named Akiva would be known, for ritual purposes in a synagogue, as "Akiva ben Avraham Avinu"; in cases where the mother's name is used, such as for the prayer for recovery from an illness, he would be known as "Akiva ben Sarah Imenu".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ukdp.co.uk/name-change-religious-conversion/#Judaism |title=Changing Your Name Upon Religious Conversion &amp;#124; UK Deed Poll |publisher=Ukdp.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Talmudic opinions on converts are numerous; some positive, some negative. A quote from the [[Talmud]] labels the convert "hard on Israel as a scab". Many interpretations explain this quote as meaning converts can be unobservant and lead Jews to be unobservant, or converts can be so observant that born Jews feel ashamed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishpress.com/displayContent_new.cfm?mode=a&amp;sectionid=58&amp;contentid=13089&amp;contentName=Daf+Yomi Daf Yomi] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216071447/http://www.jewishpress.com/displayContent_new.cfm?mode=a&amp;sectionid=58&amp;contentid=13089&amp;contentName=Daf+Yomi |date=16 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jews by choice==
The term "Jew by choice" is often used to describe someone who, with no ancestral connection to the Jewish people, chose to convert to Judaism. It is often contrasted with such terms as "Jew by birth" (or "Jew by chance"). The practice of conversion to Judaism is sometimes understood within Orthodox Judaism in terms of [[reincarnation]]. According to this school of thought in Judaism, when non-Jews are drawn to Judaism, it is because they had been Jews in a former life. Such souls may "wander among nations" through multiple lives, until they find their way back to Judaism, including through finding themselves born in a gentile family with a "lost" Jewish ancestor.&lt;ref&gt;''Jewish Tales of Reincarnation', By Yonasson Gershom, Yonasson Gershom, Jason Aronson, Incorporated, 31 Jan 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bnei Anusim==
In recent decades, there has been a renewed Jewish conversion interest with some Bnei Anusim, that is, the descendants of Jews who were [[forced conversion|forced to convert]] to other faiths.

The [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] term for forced converts is "[[Anusim]]" (lit. "[the] forced [converts]"), while the descendants of said converts are called "Bnei Anusim" (lit. "[the] children [of the] forced [converts]").

In the modern era, the single most notable and numerous group of Bnei Anusim converts are the [[Sephardic Bnei Anusim]], descendants of those [[Sephardic Jews]] who were forced to convert to Christianity during the Spanish and Portuguese Inquisition. They are found throughout [[Iberia]] (Spain and Portugal) and [[Iberoamerica]] (the Hispanic countries of the Americas plus Brazil). There has been a continuous steady growth among them who are now prospective converts, actively seeking conversions back to Judaism.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

Since many Bnei Anusim (i.e. descendants of forced converts) lack an unbroken matrilineal Jewish line of descent or lack satisfactory documentary evidence to that effect (even if they can prove Jewish ancestry along one or all other of their lineages besides their direct matrilineal lineage), conversion has been a growing option for them to return to Judaism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kulanu.org/anousim/index.html |title=Index|accessdate=18 June 2009 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Enabling Act in colour.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Hitler's Reichstag speech promoting the bill was delivered at the [[Kroll Opera House]], following the [[Reichstag fire]].]]

The '''Enabling Act''' ([[German language|German]]: ''{{lang|de|Ermächtigungsgesetz}}'') of 1933, formally titled '''''{{lang|de|Gesetz zur Behebung der Not von Volk und Reich}}''''' ("Law to Remedy the Distress of People and [[Reich]]"),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Third Reich Sourcebook|last1=Rabinbach|first1=Anson|last2=Gilman|first2=Sander L.|year=2013|isbn=0520276833|page=52}}&lt;/ref&gt; was an amendment to the [[Weimar Constitution]]{{cn|date=July 2018}} that gave the [[Hitler Cabinet|German Cabinet]] — in effect, [[Chancellor of Germany|Chancellor]] [[Adolf Hitler]] — the power to enact laws without the involvement of the [[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]].  The Enabling Act gave Hitler [[plenary power]]s and followed on the heels of the [[Reichstag Fire Decree]], which had abolished most civil liberties and transferred state powers to the Reich government. The combined effect of the two laws was to transform Hitler's government into a legal dictatorship.

The act passed in both the Reichstag and  [[Reichsrat (Germany)|Reichsrat]] on 23 March 1933,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blogs.britannica.com/2007/03/the-reichstag-fire-and-the-enabling-act/|title=The Reichstag Fire and the Enabling Act of March 23, 1933 {{!}} Britannica Blog|website=blogs.britannica.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dw.com/en/the-law-that-enabled-hitlers-dictatorship/a-16689839|title=The law that 'enabled' Hitler's dictatorship {{!}} Germany {{!}} DW.COM  23.03.2013|last=(www.dw.com)|first=Deutsche Welle|website=DW.COM|language=en|access-date=2017-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Republic to Reich: A History of Germany 1918-1945|last=Mason|first=K. J.|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was signed by [[President of Germany (1919–1945)|President]] [[Paul von Hindenburg]] later that day. The act stated that it was to last four years unless renewed by the Reichstag, which occurred twice. 

The law was enacted by the Reichstag (meeting at the [[Kroll Opera House]]), where non-Nazi members were surrounded and threatened by members of [[Sturmabteilung|SA]] and [[SS]]. The [[Communist Party of Germany|Communists]] had already been repressed and were not allowed to be present or to vote, and some [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democrats]] were kept away as well. In the end, most of those present voted for the act, except for the Social Democrats, who voted against it.&lt;ref&gt;Kitson, Alison. ''Germany, 1858-1990: Hope, Terror, and Revival'', pages 153-154 (Oxford U. Press 2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
After being appointed chancellor of Germany on 30 January 1933, Hitler asked President von Hindenburg to dissolve the Reichstag. A [[German election, 1933|general election]] was scheduled for 5 March 1933. A [[Secret Meeting of 20 February 1933|secret meeting]] was held between Hitler and 20 to 25 industrialists at the official residence of [[Hermann Göring]] in the Reichstag Presidential Palace aimed at financing the election campaign of the [[Nazi Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author = Daniela Kahn |title = Die Steurung der Wirtschaft durch Recht im nationalsozialistischen Deutschland. Das Beispiel der Reichsgruppe Industrie|year = 2006|isbn = 978-3-465-04012-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author = Rüdiger Jungbluth|title = Die Quandts. Ihr leiser Aufstieg zur mächtigsten Wirtschaftsdynastie Deutschlands|year = 2002|isbn = 3-593-36940-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Reichstag fire|burning of the Reichstag]], depicted by the Nazis as the beginning of a communist revolution, resulted in the presidential [[Reichstag Fire Decree]], which among other things suspended [[freedom of press]] and ''[[habeas corpus]]'' rights just five days before the election. Hitler used the decree to have the [[Communist Party of Germany|Communist Party]]'s offices raided and its representatives arrested, effectively eliminating them as a political force.

Although they received five million more votes than in the previous election, the Nazis failed to gain an absolute majority in parliament, and depended on the 8% of seats won by their coalition partner, the [[German National People's Party]], to reach 52% in total.

To free himself from this dependency, Hitler had the cabinet, in its first post-election meeting on 15 March, draw up plans for an Enabling Act which would give the cabinet legislative power for four years. The Nazis devised the Enabling Act to gain complete political power without the need of the support of a majority in the [[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]] and without the need to bargain with their coalition partners.

===Preparations and negotiations===
The Enabling Act allowed the cabinet to enact legislation, including laws deviating from or altering the constitution, without the consent of the Reichstag. Because this law allowed for departures from the constitution, it was itself considered a constitutional amendment. Thus, its passage required the support of two-thirds of those deputies who were present and voting. A [[quorum]] of two-thirds of the entire Reichstag was required to be present in order to call up the bill.

The Social Democrats (SPD) and the Communists (KPD) were expected to vote against the Act. The government had already arrested all Communist and some Social Democrat deputies under the Reichstag Fire Decree. The Nazis expected the parties representing the middle class, the [[Junker]]s and business interests to vote for the measure, as they had grown weary of the instability of the [[Weimar Republic]] and would not dare to resist.

Hitler believed that with the [[Centre Party (Germany)|Centre Party]] members' votes, he would get the necessary two-thirds majority. Hitler negotiated with the Centre Party's chairman, [[Ludwig Kaas]], a Catholic priest, finalising an agreement by 22 March. Kaas agreed to support the Act in exchange for assurances of the Centre Party's continued existence, the protection of Catholics' civil and religious liberties, religious schools and the retention of civil servants affiliated with the Centre Party. It has also been suggested that some members of the SPD were intimidated by the presence of the [[Sturmabteilung|Nazi Sturmabteilung (SA)]] throughout the proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Collier, From Kaiser to Fuhrer: Germany, 1900-45, p131&lt;/ref&gt;

Some historians, such as [[Klaus Scholder]], have maintained that Hitler also promised to negotiate a [[Reichskonkordat]] with the Holy See, a treaty that formalised the position of the Catholic Church in Germany on a national level. Kaas was a close associate of Cardinal Pacelli, then Vatican Secretary of State (and later [[Pope Pius XII]]). Pacelli had been pursuing a German concordat as a key policy for some years but the instability of Weimar governments as well as the enmity of some parties to such a treaty rendered the project moot.&lt;ref&gt;Klaus Scholder "The Churches and the Third Reich" volume 1 pp 160-1&lt;/ref&gt; The day after the Enabling Act vote, Kaas went to Rome in order to, in his own words, "investigate the possibilities for a comprehensive understanding between church and state".&lt;ref&gt;Letter from Kaas to von Bergen, German ambassador to the Vatican, translation quoted in Scholder, p. 247&lt;/ref&gt; However, so far no evidence for a link between the Enabling Act and the Reichskonkordat signed on 20 July 1933 has surfaced.

==Text==
As with most of the laws passed in the process of ''[[Gleichschaltung]]'', the Enabling Act is quite short, especially considering its implications. The full text, in German&lt;ref&gt;Uwe Brodersen, Gesetze des NS-Staates, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; and English, follows:

[[File:Ermächtigungsgesetz 1933-03-24 Blatt 2.jpg|thumb|Act (page 2 with signatures)]]

==Passage==
Debate within the Centre Party continued until the day of the vote, 23 March 1933, with Kaas advocating voting in favour of the act, referring to an upcoming written guarantee from Hitler, while former Chancellor [[Heinrich Brüning]] called for a rejection of the Act. The majority sided with Kaas, and Brüning agreed to maintain party discipline by voting for the Act.&lt;ref name="RiseFall" /&gt;

The Reichstag, led by its President, [[Hermann Göring]], changed its rules of procedure to make it easier to pass the bill.  Under the [[Weimar Constitution]], a [[quorum]] of two-thirds of the entire Reichstag membership was required to be present in order to bring up a constitutional amendment bill.  In this case, 432 of the Reichstag's 647 deputies would have normally been required for a quorum.  However, Göring reduced the quorum to 378 by not counting the 81 KPD deputies.  Despite the virulent rhetoric directed against the Communists, the Nazis did not formally ban the KPD right away.  Not only did they fear a violent uprising, but they hoped the KPD's presence on the ballot would siphon off votes from the SPD.  However, it was an open secret that the KPD deputies would never be allowed to take their seats; they were thrown in jail as quickly as the police could track them down.  Courts began taking the line that since the Communists were responsible for the fire, KPD membership was an act of treason.  Thus, for all intents and purposes, the KPD was banned as of 6 March, the day after the election.&lt;ref name=Evans/&gt;

Göring also declared that any deputy who was "absent without excuse" was to be considered as present, in order to overcome obstructions. Leaving nothing to chance, the Nazis used the provisions of the Reichstag Fire Decree to detain several SPD deputies. A few others saw the writing on the wall and fled into exile.

Later that day, the Reichstag assembled under intimidating circumstances, with [[Sturmabteilung|SA men]] swarming inside and outside the chamber.&lt;ref name=RiseFall/&gt; Hitler's speech, which emphasised the importance of Christianity in German culture,&lt;ref name=Speech&gt;{{cite web|url=http://atheism.about.com/od/adolfhitlernazigermany/a/HitlerValues.htm |title=Adolf Hitler: Compromises with Atheism Destroy Religious, Ethical Values |publisher=about.com |accessdate=2 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; was aimed particularly at appeasing the Centre Party's sensibilities and incorporated Kaas' requested guarantees almost verbatim. Kaas gave a speech, voicing the Centre's support for the bill amid "concerns put aside", while Brüning notably remained silent.

Only SPD chairman [[Otto Wels]] spoke against the Act, declaring that the proposed bill could not "destroy ideas which are eternal and indestructible." Kaas had still not received the written constitutional guarantees he had negotiated, but with the assurance it was being "typed up", voting began. Kaas never received the letter.&lt;ref name=RiseFall/&gt;{{Page needed|date=December 2016}}

At this stage, the majority of deputies already supported the bill, and any deputies who might have been reluctant to vote in favour were intimidated by the SA troops surrounding the meeting. In the end, all parties except the SPD voted in favour of the Enabling Act. With the KPD banned and 26 SPD deputies arrested or in hiding, the final tally was 444 in favour of the Enabling Act against 94 (all Social Democrats) opposed. The Reichstag had adopted the Enabling Act with the support of 83% of the deputies.  If all SPD deputies had been present, it would have still passed with 78.7% support.  The same day in the evening, the [[Reichsrat (Germany)|Reichsrat]] also gave its approval, unanimously and without prior discussion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Wheaton|first= Eliot Barculo |date= 1968|title= The Nazi Revolution 1933-35|url= |location= |publisher= |page= 269|isbn= |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Act was then signed into law by  President Hindenburg.

==Consequences==
{{refimprove section|date=March 2015}}
Under the Act, the government had acquired the authority to pass laws without either parliamentary consent or control. These laws could (with certain exceptions) even deviate from the Constitution. The Act effectively eliminated the Reichstag as active players in German politics.  While its existence was protected by the Enabling Act, for all intents and purposes it reduced the Reichstag to a mere stage for Hitler's speeches. It only met sporadically until the end of World War II, held no debates and enacted only a few laws. Within three months of the passage of the Enabling Act, all parties except the Nazi Party were banned or pressured into dissolving themselves, followed on 14 July by a law that made the Nazi Party the only legally permitted party in the country. With this, Hitler had fulfilled what he had promised in earlier campaign speeches: "I set for myself one aim ... to sweep these thirty parties out of Germany!"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://alex.onb.ac.at/cgi-content/alex?aid=dra&amp;datum=1933&amp;page=604&amp;size=45|title=ÖNB-ALEX - Deutsches Reichsgesetzblatt Teil I 1867-1945|last=Nationalbibliothek|first=Österreichische|website=alex.onb.ac.at|access-date=2016-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the negotiations between the government and the political parties, it was agreed that the government should inform the Reichstag parties of legislative measures passed under the Enabling Act. For this purpose, a working [[committee]] was set up, co-chaired by Hitler and Centre Party chairman Kaas. However, this committee met only three times without any major impact, and rapidly became a dead letter even before all other parties were banned.

Though the Act had formally given legislative powers to the government as a whole, these powers were for all intents and purposes exercised by Hitler himself. After its passage, there were no longer serious deliberations in Cabinet meetings. Its meetings became more and more infrequent after 1934, and it never met in full after 1938.

Due to the great care that Hitler took to give his dictatorship an appearance of legality, the Enabling Act was renewed twice, in 1937 and 1941. However, its renewal was practically assured since all other parties were banned. Voters were presented with a single list of Nazis and Nazi-approved "guest" candidates under far-from-secret conditions. In 1942, the Reichstag passed a law giving Hitler power of life and death over every citizen, effectively extending the provisions of the Enabling Act for the duration of the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1942/04/27/page/1/article/hitler-seizes-life-and-death-rule-of-nazis|title=HITLER SEIZES LIFE AND DEATH RULE OF NAZIS (April 27, 1942)|access-date=2016-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ironically, two, and possibly three, of the penultimate measures Hitler took to consolidate his power in 1934 violated the Enabling Act. In February 1934, the Reichsrat, representing the states, was abolished even though Article 2 of the Enabling Act specifically protected the existence of both the Reichstag and the Reichsrat.  It can be argued that the Enabling Act had been breached two weeks earlier by the Law for the Reconstruction of the Reich, which transferred the states' powers to the Reich and effectively left the Reichsrat impotent. Article 2 stated that laws passed under the Enabling Act could not affect the institutions of either chamber. In August, Hindenburg died, and Hitler seized the president's powers for himself in accordance with a law passed the previous day.  Article 2 stated that the president's powers were to remain "undisturbed," which has long been interpreted to mean that it forbade Hitler from tampering with the presidency. A 1932 amendment to the constitution made the president of the High Court of Justice, not the chancellor, first in the line of succession to the presidency—and even then on an interim basis pending new elections.&lt;ref name="RiseFall"&gt;William Shirer, ''[[The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich]]'' Touchstone Edition, New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the Enabling Act provided no remedy for any violations of Article 2, and these actions were never challenged in court.

British historian [[Richard J. Evans]] in his book, ''[[The Third Reich Trilogy#The Coming of the Third Reich|The Coming of the Third Reich]]'', argued that the Enabling Act may have been invalid. He contended that Göring's refusal to even acknowledge the Communist seats for the purposes of a quorum was an "illegal act."  (It should be noted that even if the Communists had been present and voting, the Act would have still passed with, at the very least, 68.7 percent support.)  He also argued that the act's passage in the Reichsrat was tainted by the overthrow of the state governments.&lt;ref name=Evans&gt;{{cite book|last=Evans|first=Richard J.|authorlink=Richard J. Evans|title=[[The Third Reich Trilogy#The Coming of the Third Reich|The Coming of the Third Reich]]|publisher=[[Penguin Group|Penguin Press]]|location=[[New York City]]|date=2003|isbn=978-0141009759}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Portrayal in films ==
The film ''[[Hitler: The Rise of Evil]]'' contains a scene portraying the passage of the Enabling Act. The portrayal in the film is inaccurate, with the provisions of the [[Reichstag Fire Decree]] (which in practice, as the name states, was a decree issued by President Hindenburg weeks before the Enabling Act) merged into the Act. Non-Nazi members of the [[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]], including Vice-Chancellor [[Franz von Papen|von Papen]], are shown objecting. In reality the Act met little resistance, with only the centre-left [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democratic Party]] voting against passage.

The same film also shows [[Hermann Göring]], the then speaker of the house, begin singing "[[Deutschlandlied]]". Nazi representatives then stand and immediately join in with Göring; bizarrely, all other party members join in too, with everyone performing the Hitler salute. In reality, this never happened.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7793">'''Executive Order 13087''' was signed by [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Bill Clinton]] on May 28, 1998, amending [[Executive Order 11478]] to prohibit [[discrimination]] based on [[sexual orientation]] in the [[competitive service]] of the [[Office of Personnel Management|federal civilian workforce]].  The order also applies to employees of the government of the [[District of Columbia]], and the [[United States Postal Service]].  However, it does not apply to positions and agencies in the [[excepted service]], such as the [[Central Intelligence Agency]], [[National Security Agency]], and the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]].
[[Image:Clinton signing document.jpg|thumb|right|President [[Bill Clinton]] signs a document in the [[Oval Office]] at the [[White House]]]]
In a statement issued the same day that he signed the order, President Clinton said:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

{{quote|The Executive Order states Administration policy but does not and cannot create any new enforcement rights (such as the ability to proceed before the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission). Those rights can be granted only by legislation passed by the Congress, such as the Employment Non-Discrimination Act.}}

Federal employees cannot appeal claims of discrimination under Executive Order 13087 to the [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission|EEOC]], but they can file complaints under the grievance procedure of the agency where they work and, under certain conditions, may appeal their claims to the [[United States Merit Systems Protection Board|Merit Systems Protection Board]] or the [[Office of Special Counsel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.opm.gov/er/address2/Guide04.asp |title=Addressing Sexual Orientation Discrimination In Federal Civilian Employment: A Guide to Employee's Rights |accessdate=2006-12-25 |author=U.S. Office of Personnel Management |authorlink=Office of Personnel Management |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070114092004/http://www.opm.gov/er/address2/Guide04.asp |archivedate=2007-01-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Clinton had previously included "sexual orientation" in [[Executive Order 12968]] (1995) when listing the characteristics forbidden as the basis for discrimination when granting federal employees access to classified information.

The order applied to civilian employees of the American military,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cpol.army.mil/library/permiss/5236.html |title=PERMISS - Civilian Sexual Orientation Policy |accessdate=2006-12-25 |author=[[United States Army]] |date=2006-06-20 |work=Personnel Management Information and Support System (PERMISS)}}&lt;/ref&gt; but not to uniformed members of the [[United States armed forces|armed forces]], who, at the time, were covered by the [[Don't ask, don't tell]] directive issued by Clinton in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://biotech.law.lsu.edu/blaw/dodd/corres/html2/d130426x.htm |title=Defense Directive 1304.26:  Qualification Standards for Enlistment, Appointment, and Induction |date=December 21, 1993 |publisher=Department of Defense}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Opponents in [[United States Congress|Congress]] objected to the Order and said that it provided special privileges and "special breaks for special interests,"&lt;ref name=varona&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fedglobe.org/actions/HRC-EOarticle.htm |title=Order Offers Equal, Not Special, Protection for Gays |accessdate=2006-12-25 |author=Anthony E. Varona |author2=Kevin Layton|author3=Christine Clark-Trevino |date=1998-07-06 |work=New Jersey Law Journal }}&lt;/ref&gt; Donald Devine, who headed the Office of Personnel Management from 1981 to 1995, criticized Clinton's decision to implement the non-discrimination policy by issuing an Executive Order, "issued out of the glare of public attention," and called on Congress to act to undo the President's action "before it can do much damage both to the orderly management of the government and to its equal employment policies generally."&lt;ref name=mayer&gt;Kenneth E. Mayer, ''With the a Stroke of a Pen: Executive Orders and Presidential Power'' (Garden City, NY: Princeton University Press, 2001), 214-5, 276n162&lt;/ref&gt; On June 11, 1998, the conservative [[Southern Baptist Convention]] passed a resolution asking the President to rescind the order and demanding that [[United States Congress|Congress]] nullify it if he did not do so.&lt;ref name=varona /&gt; Later in 1998, several congressmen, including Republicans [[Bob Barr]] of Georgia and [[Joel Hefley]] of Colorado, introduced bills designed to overturn 13087 or to prohibit government agencies from spending any funds to enforce it. In August 1998, an amendment to the Commerce, Justice, State, Judiciary, and Related Agencies appropriations bill that sought to prohibit spending on behalf of 13087 failed in the House of Representatives on a vote of 176 to 252, the only recorded vote on the issue.&lt;ref name=mayer /&gt;

According to the [[Equal Opportunity Commission]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.eeoc.gov/facts/fs-orientation_parent_marital_political.html |title=Facts About Discrimination Based on Sexual Orientation, Status as a Parent, Marital Status and Political Affiliation |accessdate=2006-12-25 |author=U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission |authorlink=Equal Employment Opportunity Commission |date=2001-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Executive Order 13087 did not create any new rights; however, it did set the stage for positive and constructive action by all units of the federal government to make certain that the workplace is one free from harassment and discrimination.}}

In 2005, the [[Human Rights Campaign]] and others claimed that "the head of the Office of Special Counsel, [[Scott Bloch]], refuses to enforce these longstanding non-discrimination protections."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17226">The '''Government Law Center''' (GLC) of [[Albany Law School]] is a non-profit law and public policy organization and think tank based in [[Albany, New York]]. The GLC is the oldest government law center in the United States, conducting research and education in law and public policy. The Center's areas of expertise include land use planning and zoning, environment, government ethics, local government, aging, public authorities, Chinese Law, racing and gaming, early stage business support for alternate energy, and civilian police review.&lt;ref name=GLCWeb&gt;{{cite web|title=Government Law Center|url=http://www.albanylaw.edu/sub.php?navigation_id=668|work=Albany Law School}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The GLC's principal mission is to conduct programs and research that inform the public policy debate through non-partisan, comprehensive analysis of critical government-related issues. The GLC provides research and technical assistance to public officials and presents instruction for the general public.

The GLC has published a number of reports online at ''Government Law Online''. The Center offers fellowships and internships for students to enhance their academic learning.  The current interim Director of the center is Robert Heverly.  Beginning in August 2013, [[Raymond Brescia]] will take over as Director.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Professor Ray Brescia to Lead Government Law Center at Albany Law School|url=http://www.albanylaw.edu/about/news/current/Pages/Professor-Ray-Brescia-to-Lead-Government-Law-Center-at-Albany-Law-School.aspx|publisher=Albany Law School|accessdate=7/3/2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==History==
&lt;br&gt;
The Government Law Center was founded in 1978, the product of a grant initiated at the federal level and administered by New York State through the [[New York State Department of State]], under the leadership of [[Mario Cuomo|Mario M. Cuomo]] as then-Secretary of State. Cuomo worked with Albany Law School Professors Sandra Stevenson and Bernard Harvith to secure a grant through the United States Office of Personnel Management and the [[United States Civil Service Commission]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hawksley|first=Jane|title=Albany's government law center serves as model|newspaper=The Business Review|date=October 26, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor Sandra Stevenson served as the GLC's Director for a few months before J. Langdon Marsh became the first full-time director of the GLC on March 1, 1979&lt;ref name=Salkin101&gt;{{cite journal|last=Salkin|first=Patricia|title=Teaching Government Law &amp; Policy in Law School: Reflections on Twenty-Five Years of Experience|journal=Albany Law Review|year=2003|volume=66|pages=101–133}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Center contracted with the [[New York State Department of Environmental Conservation]] to prepare its first state legal report in 1980, titled "Selected Legal Problems in the Control of Hazardous Wastes." The Center proceeded to enter into contracts with several New York State agencies, including the [[New York State Department of Family Assistance|New York State Department of Social Services]], [[Adirondack Park Agency]], [[New York State Department of State]], [[New York State Department of Health]], and with the [[New York State Legislature]], to produce reports and offer training. Under Marsh's direction, the Center also focused on issues related to [[hazardous waste]], zoning and planning, environmental quality review, [[economic development]], and local government.

Marsh left the Center in July 1983, and for a brief time following, Joseph W. Bellacosa served as the Center's director. He subsequently was appointed by then-New York State Governor Mario M. Cuomo to serve as a Judge on the Court of Claims and Chief Administrative Judge of all State Courts, followed by a fourteen-year term on the [[New York Court of Appeals]].
In 1983, Professor Sandra M. Stevenson was re-appointed Associate Dean and Director of the Government Law Center, assuming the position she had held in the first months of the Center's existence.&lt;ref name="salkin"/&gt; During her tenure, the GLC conducted training programs in [[alternative dispute resolution]] (ADR) and tying ADR to intellectual property. Under Stevenson's leadership in 1989, Albany Law School and the Government Law Center became the official repository for tapes of oral arguments heard before the New York Court of Appeals.
In 1990, Professor George F. Carpinello was appointed Director. Under Carpinello, the Center introduced the ''Warren M. Anderson Legislative Breakfast Seminar Series'', a series focused on topics of interest to legislators and policy makers, named for the former President Pro Tem and [[Majority Leader of the New York State Senate]]. The GLC also began producing a newsletter for the County Attorneys Association of New York State (CAASNY), prepared the first edition of ''Legal Careers in New York State Government'' (with later editions published by the [[New York State Bar Association]]), and placed student interns in the counsel's office of various state agencies.

[[Patricia Salkin|Patricia E. Salkin]], Raymond and Ella Smith Distinguished Professor of Law and Associate Dean of Albany Law School, was appointed Director of the GLC in 1992, and served as the Center's Director until her appointment as dean of the Touro College Jacob D. Fuchsberg Law Center in 2012. In the first years under Salkin's leadership, the GLC began the ''Edgar and Margaret Sandman Fellowship in Aging and Health Law'', and created the Senior Citizen's Law Day, a day-long program providing local seniors with free seminars on important issues related to aging. The ''Aging Law and Policy Program'' was established in 1994 to focus on issues related to aging.&lt;ref name=salkin/&gt;

In 1994, the GLC also received funding through the [[United States Department of Education]] to create the ''Mediation Assistance Program'' to train and state-certify law and non-law students as volunteer mediators for New York's Community Dispute Settlement Program,&lt;ref name=salkin&gt;{{cite journal|last=Salkin|first=Patricia|title=Teaching Government Law &amp; Policy in Law School: Reflections on Twenty-Five Years of Experience|journal=Albany Law Review|year=2003|volume=66|pages=102–133}}&lt;/ref&gt; leading to the establishment of the ''Program on Public Policy Dispute Resolution'' to focus on issues emerging in this field.

In the years that followed, a number of additional programs were initiated. ''The Lawrence F. Klepper Legal Assistance Program for Non-Profit Organizations'', helping to place law students with attorneys who provide pro bono or very low-cost services to nonprofits, was established at the GLC in 1994 by friends of the former Executive Director of the [[Legal Aid Society]] and with the support of [[Congregation Beth Emeth]].&lt;ref name=DeMare25&gt;{{cite news|last=DeMare|first=Carol|title=Government Law Center to Mark 25 Years of Service|newspaper=Times Union|date=February 20, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Edwin L. Crawford Memorial Lecture in Municipal Law'' was launched in 1996 to address issues of state and national importance to municipal officials. In 1998, the GLC's ''Government Law Network'' began as a way for people working in or with government to meet key law and policy makers at exclusive "Networking Breakfast" forums. The Center's ''Alumni Leaders in Government Networking Series'' provided students with an opportunity to interact with notable Albany Law School graduates.

In 1999, the GLC together with the Albany Law Clinic and Justice Center established the ''Semester in Government Program'', offering students full-time internships in government counsel offices in Albany and Washington, D.C. The Center also began producing ''The Government Law &amp; Policy Journal'' for the New York State Bar Association's Committee on Attorneys in Public Service.

In 2000, the GLC started providing services for the City of Albany's newly created ''Citizen's Police Review Board'', established by a law calling upon an academic institution to support the oversight of law enforcement.&lt;ref name="Benjamin CPRB"&gt;{{cite news|last=Benjamin|first=Elizabeth|title=Albany Law at Heart of Police Oversight|newspaper=Times Union|date=April 28, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The GLC moved to its new location on the Albany Law School campus in 2001. The same year, the Center hosted the annual "Saratoga Institute on Racing and Gaming Law" as part of its ''Program on Racing and Gaming Law''.&lt;ref name="DeMare Racing"&gt;{{cite news|last=DeMare|first=Carole|title=Law Center Jumps Into Gaming|newspaper=Times Union|date=November 8, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Center also received funding from the [[United States Department of Housing and Urban Development]] to expand mediation services for area housing communities.

In 2002, the GLC and Squire, Sanders and Dempsey began sponsoring the ''William B. Sanders Law and Public Policy Forum''. New York State officials such as former Governor [[David Paterson|David A. Paterson]], then Attorney General [[Eliot Spitzer]], and Assembly Speaker [[Sheldon Silver]] have participated. The ''Government Lawyer in Residence'' program at the GLC was established in 2002 to give the Center and law students the resources of a former government attorney.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A Few Words with James P King|newspaper=The Business Review|date=October 25, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The GLC also produced a new edition of the ''Manual for Administrative Law Judges and Hearing Officers'' published by the New York State Department of Civil Service; a conference on the 30th anniversary of the [[Adirondack Park]]; New York's first conference on "smart growth"; a program to mark the 25th anniversary of the State Environmental Quality Review Act; and a symposium on siting new power plants in New York.

The GLC hosted the inaugural ''Nancy M. Sills '76 Memorial Lecture'', featuring then-Lieutenant Governor [[Mary Donohue|Mary O. Donohue]], at the 10th Annual Senior Citizen's Law Day in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Lieutenant Governor Donohue Speaks at Tenth Annual Senior Citizens Law Day|journal=Government Law Center Newsletter|issue=Winter 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Summer in Government'' was also introduced as a way to provide students with internship placements with government lawyers in Albany.

In 2004 the GLC, in partnership with public television station [[WMHT (TV)|WMHT]], produced "Inside the Inner Circle," focused on the process of state policymaking, featuring former counsels to five New York governors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=GLC Television Program Takes Viewers "Inside the Inner Circle"|journal=Government Law Center Newsletter|volume=Fall 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In 2005 the Center introduced Graduate and Post-Graduate Fellowships for law and policy research and a Faculty Affiliate program to augment its research capability. Historian and scholar [[Paul Finkelman]] was named Senior Faculty Fellow at the GLC and Albany Law School's President William McKinley Distinguished Professor of Law and Public Policy. The ''Clarence D. "Rapp" Rappleyea Government Lawyer in Residence Program'' was established to recognize the former State Assembly Minority Leader.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Clarence D.Rappleyea Appointed Government Lawyer in Residence at the GLC|journal=Government Law Center Newsletter|issue=Fall 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005 - 2007, the GLC took on a number of new projects: a series of procurement law initiatives to help improve New York State's procurement process and identify potential areas of reform in the 1995 Procurement Stewardship Act; providing technical assistance related to consolidations, mergers, dissolutions, cooperative agreements and shared services as part of the ''Shared Municipal Services Incentive (SMSI) Grant Program'', under a contract with the New York State Department of State; establishing a ''Non-Profit Legal Assistance Program'' with the assistance of then-U.S. Congressman [[Michael R. McNulty]]; and the establishment of the ''Public Authorities Project'', to provide research on legal aspects of public policy issues facing public authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=GLC Launches Public Authorities Project to Provide|journal=Government Law Center Newsletter|issue=Fall 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The GLC also hosted a number of conferences and programs during 2005 - 2007, including: a [[Cornell University]] co-sponsored invitational series on New York State water resources; a national teleconference on the legal aspects of commercializing hydrogen technology; a forum on the siting of wind facilities in New York, in partnership with the [[New York State Energy Research and Development Authority]] (NYSERDA);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=New York’s Potential for Wind Energy Development|journal=Government Law Center Newsletter|issue=Fall 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; a national teleconference series on renewable energy, sponsored by the American Council on Renewable Energy; and a symposium on municipal broadband and WiFi policies, in cooperation with the New York State Office for Technology, the New York State Public Service Commission, the New York State Department of State, and the [[Empire State Development Corporation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=State’s Municipal Broadband Policy|journal=Government Law Center Newsletter|issue=Fall 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; To celebrate the 20th anniversary of the ''Ethics in Government Act'', the GLC convened a symposium in 2007 keynoted by former Fordham Law School Dean [[John Feerick]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=20 Years of Ethics Reform - The Ethics in Government Act Revisited|journal=Government Law Center Newsletter|issue=Fall 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Government Law Center proceeded to sponsor and co-sponsor numerous conferences in 2008 - 2009, including a 2009 conference on building in the 21st century, co-sponsored with the [[American Institute of Architects]], New York State and the [[New York City Bar Association]]; a symposium on E-FOIL and the impact of technology on accessing records featuring Miriam Nisbet, Director of the Office of Government Information Services, United States National Archives and Records Administration;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Speakers Debate Challenges of|journal=Government Law Center Newsletter|issue=Spring 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a symposium on preserving executive records in 2010, with former Governor of Pennsylvania and United States Attorney General [[Dick Thornburgh]] and presidential historian [[Richard Norton Smith]].

In 2010 - 2011, in conjunction with the Albany Law School's ''Albany Law Review'', the GLC held symposia on education reform with Charles Rose, General Counsel for the [[United States Department of Education]]; baseball and the law, featuring [[John Thorn]], Major League Baseball's official Baseball Historian;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Baseball and the Law Conference|journal=Government Law Center Newsletter|issue=Spring 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender ([[LGBT]]) rights, keynoted by [[Jeh Johnson]], General Counsel for the [[United States Department of Defense]].

In 2009, Albany Law School was awarded a four-year, $250,000 incentive by NYSERDA to help create sustainable networks in New York State that support early-stage companies focused on [[sustainable energy|renewable and clean energy]] product development. In 2010, the GLC received additional funding from NYSERDA to begin providing legal education and early stage business support to New York's [[cleantech]] and alternative energy companies, including a web-based resource, ''Legal Handbook for Early Stage Business''.

In 2010, the GLC introduced the nationwide ''Public Authorities Information Clearinghouse (PAIC)'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Public Authority Reform Research Results in On-Line Clearinghouse and Public Clearinghouse and Publication|journal=Government Law Center Newsletter|issue=Spring 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; designed to help government officials, public interest groups, and others navigate documents that pertain to the operation of government of public authorities. A blog on public authorities was launched in 2011.

The '''Grand Sanhedrin''' was a Jewish high court convened in Europe by [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon I]] to give legal sanction to the principles expressed by the [[Assembly of Notables]] in answer to the twelve questions submitted to it by the government.&lt;ref&gt;Jew. Encyc. v. 468, s.v. France&lt;/ref&gt; The name was chosen to imply that the Grand Sanhedrin had the authority of the original [[Sanhedrin]] that had been the main legislative and judicial body of the [[Jew]]ish people in classical and late antiquity.

==Assembly of Notables==
An Assembly of Jewish notables was summoned in April 1806 by the Emperor to consider a set of 12 questions. Those who attended were largely from the [[Bordeaux]] or Rhine regions ([[Alsace]] and [[Lorraine (province)|Lorraine]]). They were led by [[Rabbi]] [[Joseph David Sinzheim|David Sinzheim]] of [[Strasbourg]], who presently became the president of the Sanhedrin.

The questions presented were:
[[Image:Frenchsanhedrin1.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Cover page to [[siddur]] used at the Grand Sanhedrin of Napoleon, 1807.]]
# Is it lawful for Jews to have more than one wife?
# Is divorce allowed by the Jewish religion? Is divorce valid, although pronounced not by courts of justice but by virtue of laws in contradiction to the French code?
# May a Jewess marry a Christian, or [May] a Jew [marry] a Christian woman? or does Jewish law order that the Jews should only intermarry among themselves?
# In the eyes of Jews are Frenchmen not of the Jewish religion considered as brethren or as strangers?
# What conduct does Jewish law prescribe toward Frenchmen not of the Jewish religion?
# Do the Jews born in France, and treated by the law as French citizens, acknowledge France as their country? Are they bound to defend it? Are they bound to obey the laws and follow the directions of the civil code?
# Who elects the rabbis?
# What kind of police jurisdiction do the rabbis exercise over the Jews? What judicial power do they exercise over them?
# Are the police jurisdiction of the rabbis and the forms of the election regulated by Jewish law, or are they only sanctioned by custom?
# Are there professions from which the Jews are excluded by their law?
# Does Jewish law forbid the Jews to take [[usury]] from their brethren?
# Does it forbid, or does it allow, usury in dealings with strangers?

==Creation of the Sanhedrin==
At one of the meetings of the Notables, Commissioner [[Louis-Mathieu Molé|Count Louis-Mathieu Molé]] expressed the satisfaction of the emperor with their answers, and announced that the emperor, requiring a pledge of strict adherence to these principles, had resolved to call together a 'great sanhedrin' which should convert the answers into decisions and make them the basis of the future status of the Jews, create a new organization, and condemn all false interpretations of their religious laws. In order that this sanhedrin, reviving the old Sanhedrin of Jerusalem, might be vested with the same sacred character as that time-honored institution, it was to be constituted on a similar pattern: it was to be composed of seventy-one members—two-thirds of them rabbis and one-third laymen. The Assembly of Notables, which was to continue its sessions, was to elect the members of the sanhedrin, and notify the several communities of Europe of its meeting, "that they may send deputies worthy of communicating with you and able to give to the government additional information." The Assembly of Notables was to appoint also a committee of nine, whose duty it would be to prepare the work of the sanhedrin and devise a plan for the future organization of the Jews in France and Italy (see [[Consistory (Judaism)|Consistoire]]).

On October 6, 1806, the Assembly of Notables issued a proclamation to all the Jewish communities of Europe, inviting them to send delegates to the sanhedrin, to convene on October 20. This proclamation, written in Hebrew, French, German, and Italian, speaks in extravagant terms of the importance of this revived institution and of the greatness of its imperial protector. While the action of Napoleon aroused in many Jews of Germany the hope that, influenced by it, their governments also would grant them the rights of citizenship, others looked upon it as a political contrivance. When in the war against Prussia (1806-7) the emperor invaded Poland and the Jews rendered great services to his army, he remarked, laughing, "The sanhedrin is at least useful to me."{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} [[David Friedländer]] and his friends in Berlin described it as a spectacle that Napoleon offered to the [[Paris]]ians."{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}
[[Image:Frenchsanhedrin2.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Commemorative coin|Medallion]] struck by the Paris mint in commemoration of the Grand Sanhedrin.]]
The opening of the sanhedrin was delayed until Feb. 9, 1807, four days after the adjournment of the Assembly of Notables. Its seventy-one members included the rabbis sitting in the Assembly, to whom were added twenty-nine other rabbis and twenty-five laymen. Its presiding officers, appointed by the minister of the interior, were: [[Joseph David Sinzheim]], rabbi of [[Strasbourg]] (president); [[Joshua Benzion Segre]], rabbi, and member of the municipal council of [[Vercelli]] (first vice-president); [[Abraham de Cologna]], rabbi of [[Mantua]] (second vice-president). After a solemn religious service in the synagogue, the members assembled in the [[City hall|Hôtel de Ville]], in a hall specially prepared for them. Following the ancient custom, they took their seats in a semicircle, according to age, on both sides of the presiding officers, the laymen behind the rabbis. They were attired in black garments, with silk capes and three-cornered hats. The sittings were public, and many visitors were present. The first meeting was opened with a Hebrew prayer written by [[David Sinzheim]]; after the address of the president and of [[Abraham Furtado]], chairman of the Assembly of Notables, it was adjourned. At the second sitting, Feb. 12, 1807, deputies Asser, Lemon, and Litwack, of the newly constituted Amsterdam [[Reform Judaism|Reform]] congregation Adat Jeshurun, addressed the sanhedrin, Litwack in Hebrew, the others in French, expressing their entire approval of the Assembly and promising their hearty support. But the deputies were greatly disappointed when the president, after having answered them in Hebrew, invited them to be silent listeners instead of taking part in the debates as the proclamation of the Notables had caused them to expect. Addresses from congregations in France, Italy, and the Rhenish Confederation, especially from Neuwied and Dresden, were also presented.

==Sessions of the Sanhedrin==
In the sittings of Feb. 16, 19, 23, 26, and March 2, the sanhedrin voted without discussion on the replies of the Assembly of Notables, and passed them as laws. At the eighth meeting, on March 9, Hildesheimer, deputy from [[Frankfurt-am-Main]], and Asser of [[Amsterdam]] delivered addresses, to which the president responded in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] expressing great hopes for the future. After having received the thanks of the members, he closed the sanhedrin. The Notables convened again on March 25, prepared an official report, and presented it on April 6, 1807; then the imperial commissioners declared the dissolution of the Assembly of Notables.

The decisions of the sanhedrin, formulated in nine articles and drawn up in French and Hebrew, were as follows:
# that, in conformity with the decree of R. [[Gershom ben Judah]], [[polygamy]] is forbidden to the Israelites;
# That divorce by the Jewish law is valid only after previous decision of the civil authorities;
# That the religious act of marriage must be preceded by a civil contract;
# That marriages contracted between Israelites and Christians are binding, although they cannot be celebrated with religious forms;
# That every Israelite is religiously bound to consider his non-Jewish fellow citizens as brothers, and to aid, protect, and love them as though they were coreligionists;
# That the Israelite is required to consider the land of his birth or adoption as his fatherland, and shall love and defend it when called upon;
# That Judaism does not forbid any kind of handicraft or occupation;
# That it is commendable for Israelites to engage in agriculture, manual labor, and the arts, as their ancestors in Israel were wont to do;
# That, finally, Israelites are forbidden to exact usury from Jew or [[Christian]].

In the introduction to these resolutions the sanhedrin declared that, by virtue of the right conferred upon it by ancient custom and law, it constituted, like the ancient Sanhedrin, a legal assembly vested with the power of passing ordinances in order to promote the welfare of Israel and inculcate obedience to the laws of the state. These resolutions formed the basis of all subsequent laws and regulations of the French government in regard to the religious affairs of the Jews, although Napoleon, in spite of the declarations, issued a decree on March 17, 1808, restricting the Jews' legal rights. The plan of organization prepared by the committee of nine, having for its object the creation of consistories, was not submitted to the Sanhedrin, but was promulgated by Napoleon's decree of March 17, 1808.

[[File:POL COA Wąż.svg|thumb|[[Wąż coat of arms|Kostrowicki family's coat-of-arms]]]]
'''Guillaume Apollinaire''' ({{IPA-fr|ɡijom apɔlinɛʁ|lang}}; 26 August 1880 – 9 November 1918) was a French poet, playwright, [[short story writer]], novelist, and [[art critic]] of Polish-Belarusian descent.

Apollinaire is considered one of the foremost poets of the early 20th century, as well as one of the most impassioned defenders of [[Cubism]] and a forefather of [[Surrealism]]. He is credited with coining the term "cubism" in 1911 to describe the emerging [[art movement]] and the term "surrealism" in 1917 to describe the works of [[Erik Satie]]. The term [[Orphism (art)|Orphism]] (1912) is also his. Apollinaire wrote one of the earliest Surrealist literary works, the play ''[[The Breasts of Tiresias]]'' (1917), which became the basis for the 1947 opera ''[[Les mamelles de Tirésias]]''.

Apollinaire was active as a journalist and art critic for ''[[Le Matin (France)|Le Matin]]'', ''[[L'Intransigeant]]'', ''L'Esprit nouveau'', ''[[Mercure de France]]'', and ''Paris Journal''. In 1912 Apollinaire cofounded ''{{Ill|Les Soirées de Paris|fr}}'', an artistic and literary magazine.

Two years after being wounded in [[World War I]], Apollinaire died in the [[Spanish flu]] [[pandemic]] of 1918; he was 38.

[[File:Guillaume Apollinaire, 1902, Cologne.jpg|thumb|Apollinaire, 1902, Cologne]]

Wilhelm Albert Włodzimierz Apolinary Kostrowicki was born in Rome, Italy, and was raised speaking French, Italian, and [[Polish language|Polish]].&lt;ref name="starosti1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://starosti.ru/address_article.php?address=11gio |title=Газетные "старости" (Архив) |publisher=Starosti.ru |date=9 January 1907 |accessdate=6 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He emigrated to France in his late teens and adopted the name Guillaume Apollinaire.  His mother, born Angelika Kostrowicka, was a Polish noblewoman born near [[Navahrudak]], [[Grodno Governorate]] (present-day [[Belarus]]).  His maternal grandfather was a general in the [[Imperial Russia|Russian Imperial Army]] who was killed in the [[Crimean War]].  Apollinaire's father is unknown but may have been Francesco Costantino Camillo Flugi d'Aspermont (born 1835), a [[Graubünden]] aristocrat who disappeared early from Apollinaire's life.  Francesco Flugi von Aspermont was a nephew of Conradin Flugi d'Aspermont (1787–1874), a poet who wrote in ladin putèr (an official language dialect of Switzerland spoken in Engiadina ota), and perhaps also of the Minnesänger Oswald von Wolkenstein (born c. 1377, died 2 August 1445; see ''Les ancêtres Grisons du poète Guillaume Apollinaire'' at Généanet).

Apollinaire eventually moved from Rome to Paris&lt;ref name="Baxter2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=John Baxter|title=Carnal Knowledge: Baxter's Concise Encyclopedia of Modern Sex|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7qEG7CBOH_gC|accessdate=24 December 2011|date=10 February 2009|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=978-0-06-087434-6|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and became one of the most popular members of the artistic community of Paris (both in [[Montmartre]] and [[Montparnasse]]).  His friends and collaborators in that period included [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Henri Rousseau]], [[Gertrude Stein]], [[Max Jacob]], [[André Salmon]], [[André Breton]], [[André Derain]], [[Faik Konitza]], [[Blaise Cendrars]], [[Pierre Reverdy]], [[Alexandra Exter]], [[Jean Cocteau]], [[Erik Satie]], [[Ossip Zadkine]], [[Marc Chagall]], [[Marcel Duchamp]] and [[Jean Metzinger]].  He became romantically involved with [[Marie Laurencin]], who is often identified as his muse. While there, he dabbled in [[anarchism]] and spoke out as a [[Dreyfus Affair|Dreyfusard]] in defense of Dreyfus's innocence.&lt;ref name="Schumaher"&gt;[https://books.google.es/books?isbn=1349173282 Claude Schumacher, ''Alfred Jarry and Guillaume Apollinaire''], Modern Dramatists, Macmillan International Higher Education, 1984, pp. 4, 14, 23, 148, 168, {{ISBN|1349173282}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 1909 or early 1910, Metzinger painted a Cubist portrait of Apollinaire.  In his ''Vie anecdotique'' (16 October 1911), the poet proudly writes: "I am honoured to be the first model of a Cubist painter, Jean Metzinger, for a portrait exhibited in 1910 at the Salon des Indépendants."  It was not only the first Cubist portrait, according to Apollinaire, but it was also the first great portrait of the poet exhibited in public, prior to others by [[Louis Marcoussis]], [[Amedeo Modigliani]], [[Mikhail Larionov]] and Picasso.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Metzinger, 1910, [http://www.christies.com/lotfinder/paintings/jean-metzinger-portrait-de-guillaume-apollin-4911615-details.aspx?from=searchresults&amp;intObjectID=4911615&amp;sid=bf281115-cf70-463b-ad5c-c027467afb4c Portrait of Guillaume Apollinaire], Christie's Paris, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1911 he joined the Puteaux Group, a branch of the Cubist movement soon to be known as the [[Section d'Or]].  The opening address of the 1912 Salon de la Section d'Or—the most important pre-World War I Cubist exhibition—was given by Apollinaire.&lt;ref name="La Section d'Or"&gt;[http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_s8JyxbYrSG0/TJZ4b_6VYNI/AAAAAAAABfo/5RCFXVta2yk/s1600/La+Section+d%27Or+numéro+spécial+9+octobre+1912+couv.jpg La Section d'Or], Numéro spécial, 9 Octobre 1912.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The History and Chronology of Cubism"&gt;[http://www.serdar-hizli-art.com/art_history/abstract_art/history_and_chronology_of_cubism_page_5.htm The History and Chronology of Cubism], p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 September 1911, police arrested and jailed him on suspicion of aiding and abetting the theft of the ''[[Mona Lisa]]'' and a number of Egyptian statuettes from the [[Louvre]],&lt;ref name="starosti1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k564088b/f1.image "Un homme de lettres connu est arrêté comme recéleur"], ''Le Petit Parisien'', 9 September 1911 (in French).&lt;/ref&gt; but released him a week later. The theft of the statues was committed by a former secretary of Apollinaire, Honoré Joseph Géry Pieret, who had returned one of the stolen statues to the French newspaper the ''Paris-Journal''. Apollinaire implicated his friend Picasso, who was also brought in for questioning in the theft of the ''Mona Lisa'', but he was also exonerated.&lt;ref name="monalisa25"&gt;Richard Lacayo, [http://content.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,1894006,00.html "Art's Great Whodunit: The Mona Lisa Theft of 1911"], ''Time'', 27 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The theft of the ''Mona Lisa'' was perpetrated by [[Vincenzo Peruggia]], an Italian house painter who acted alone and was only caught two years later when he tried to sell the painting in Florence. 

==Cubism==

Apollinaire wrote the preface for the first Cubist exposition outside of Paris; ''VIII Salon des Indépendants'', Brussels, 1911.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.lib.uchicago.edu/efts/ARTFL/databases/bibliopolis/art/art.bib.html Préface, in Catalogue du 8&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt; Salon annuel du Cercle d'art Les Indépendants], Musée moderne de Bruxelles, 10 June – 3 July 1911.&lt;/ref&gt; In an open-handed preface to the catalogue of the Brussels Indépendants show, Apollinaire stated that these 'new painters' accepted the name of Cubists which has been given to them. He described Cubism as a new manifestation and high art [''manifestation nouvelle et très élevée de l'art''], not a system that constrains talent [''non-point un système contraignant les talents''], and the differences which characterize not only the talents but even the styles of these artists are an obvious proof of this.&lt;ref name="Cooper"&gt;Douglas Cooper, 1971, [https://archive.org/details/cubistepoch00coop Douglas Cooper, ''The Cubist Epoch''], Los Angeles County Museum of Art, Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, N.Y., 1970, p. 97&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Françoise Roberts-Jones, [https://books.google.com/books?id=fXjRc4yYNukC&amp;pg=PA76&amp;lpg=PA76&amp;dq=%22manifestation+nouvelle+et++très+élevée+de+l'art,+mais+non+point+un+système+contraignant+les+talents%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=BJdY4mogXm&amp;sig=Ngwbhu3RL_NuuX3M0BBZYqqS8C4&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=%22manifestation%20nouvelle%20et%20%20très%20élevée%20de%20l'art%2C%20mais%20non%20point%20un%20système%20contraignant%20les%20talents%22&amp;f=false Chronique d'un musée: Musée royal des beaux-arts de Belgique], Bruxelles.&lt;/ref&gt; The artists involved with this new movement, according to Apollinaire, included [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Georges Braque]], [[Jean Metzinger]], [[Albert Gleizes]], [[Robert Delaunay]], [[Fernand Léger]], and [[Henri Le Fauconnier]].&lt;ref name="Robbins, 1985"&gt;Daniel Robbins, 1985, ''Jean Metzinger in Retrospect, Jean Metzinger: At the Center of Cubism'', University of Iowa Museum of Art, Iowa City, J.

==Orphism==
The term [[Orphism (art)|Orphism]] was coined by Apollinaire at the Salon de la [[Section d'Or]] in 1912, referring to the works of [[Robert Delaunay]] and [[František Kupka]]. During his lecture at the Section d'Or exhibit Apollinaire presented three of Kupka's abstract works as perfect examples of ''pure painting'', as anti-figurative as music.&lt;ref name="Peter Read" /&gt;

In ''[[The Cubist Painters, Aesthetic Meditations|Les Peintres Cubistes, Méditations Esthétiques]]'' (1913) Apollinaire described Orphism as "the art of painting new totalities with elements that the artist does not take from visual reality, but creates entirely by himself. [...] An Orphic painter's works should convey an ''untroubled [[aesthetics|aesthetic]] pleasure'', but at the same time a ''meaningful structure and sublime significance''. According to Apollinaire Orphism represented a move towards a completely new art-form, much as music was to literature.&lt;ref name="MoMA"&gt;Hajo Düchting, [http://www.moma.org/collection/theme.php?theme_id=10142 ''Orphism''], MoMA, From Grove Art Online, 2009 Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Surrealism==
The term Surrealism was first used by Apollinaire concerning the ballet ''[[Parade (ballet)|Parade]]'' in 1917. The poet [[Arthur Rimbaud]] wanted to be a visionary, to perceive the hidden side of things within the realm of another reality. In continuity with Rimbaud, Apollinaire went in search of a hidden and mysterious reality. The term "surrealism" appeared for the first time in March 1917 (Chronologie de Dada et du surréalisme, 1917) in a letter by Apollinaire to [[Paul Dermée]]: "All things considered, I think in fact it is better to adopt surrealism than supernaturalism, which I first used" [''Tout bien examiné, je crois en effet qu'il vaut mieux adopter surréalisme que surnaturalisme que j'avais d'abord employé''].&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Paul Clébert, ''Dictionnaire du surréalisme'', A.T.P. &amp; Le Seuil, Chamalières, p. 17, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

He described ''Parade'' as "a kind of surrealism" (''une sorte de surréalisme'') when he wrote the program note the following week, thus coining the word three years before Surrealism emerged as an art movement in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;Hargrove, Nancy (1998). "The Great Parade: Cocteau, Picasso, Satie, Massine, Diaghilev—and T.S. Eliot". Journal for the Interdisciplinary Study of Literature 31 (1)&lt;/ref&gt;

==World War I==
Apollinaire fought in [[World War I]] and, in 1916, received a serious shrapnel wound to the temple, from which he would never fully recover.&lt;ref name="Baxter2009"/&gt; He wrote ''[[The Breasts of Tiresias|Les Mamelles de Tirésias]]'' while recovering from this wound. During this period he coined the word "[[Surrealism]]" in the programme notes for [[Jean Cocteau]]'s and [[Erik Satie]]'s ballet ''[[Parade (ballet)|Parade]]'', first performed on 18 May 1917. He also published an artistic manifesto, ''L'Esprit nouveau et les poètes''. Apollinaire's status as a literary critic is most famous and influential in his recognition of the [[Marquis de Sade]], whose works were for a long time obscure, yet arising in popularity as an influence upon the [[Dadaism|Dada]] and Surrealist art movements going on in Montparnasse at the beginning of the twentieth century as, "The freest spirit that ever existed."

The war-weakened Apollinaire died of [[influenza]] during the [[Spanish flu]] pandemic of 1918.&lt;ref name="Baxter2009"/&gt; He was interred in the [[Père Lachaise Cemetery]], Paris.

==Works==
In 1900 he wrote his first novel ''Mirely, ou le petit trou pas cher'' (pornographic), which was eventually lost.&lt;ref name="Baxter2009"/&gt; Apollinaire's first collection of poetry was ''L'enchanteur pourrissant'' (1909), but ''[[Alcools]]'' (1913) established his reputation. The poems, influenced in part by the [[symbolism (arts)|Symbolist]]s, juxtapose the old and the new, combining traditional poetic forms with modern imagery. In 1913, Apollinaire published the essay ''[[The Cubist Painters, Aesthetic Meditations|Les Peintres Cubistes, Méditations Esthétiques]]'' on the [[Cubist]] painters, a movement which he helped to define. He also coined the term ''[[Orphism (art)|orphism]]'' to describe a tendency towards absolute abstraction in the paintings of [[Robert Delaunay]] and others.

In 1907 Apollinaire published the well-known [[erotic novel]], ''[[The Eleven Thousand Rods]]'' (''Les Onze Mille Verges'').&lt;ref&gt;Patrick J. Kearney, ''A History of Erotic Literature'', 1982, pp. 163–164&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Karín Lesnik-Oberstein, ''The last taboo: women and body hair'', [[Manchester University Press]], 2006, {{ISBN|0-7190-7500-9}}, p.94&lt;/ref&gt; Officially banned in France until 1970, various printings of it circulated widely for many years. Apollinaire never publicly acknowledged authorship of the novel. Another erotic novel attributed to him was ''The Exploits of a Young [[Don Juan]] (Les exploits d'un jeune Don Juan)'', in which the 15-year-old hero fathers three children with various members of his entourage, including his aunt.&lt;ref&gt;Neil Cornwell, ''The Absurd in Literature'', [[Manchester University Press]], 2006, {{ISBN|0-7190-7410-X}}, pp.86–87&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roger Shattuck, ''The Banquet Years: the arts in France, 1885–1918: Alfred Jarry, Henri Rousseau, Erik Satie, Guillaume Apollinaire'', [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]], 1961, p. 268.&lt;/ref&gt; Apollinaire's gift to Picasso of the original 1907 manuscript was one of the artist's most prized possessions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=John |last=Golding| title=Visions of the Modern| year=1994 |page=109| isbn=0520087925}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book was made into a [[Exploits of a Young Don Juan|movie in 1987]].

Shortly after his death, Mercure de France published ''[[Calligrammes]]'', a collection of his [[concrete poetry]] (poetry in which typography and layout adds to the overall effect), and more orthodox, though still modernist poems informed by Apollinaire's experiences in the First World War and in which he often used the technique of automatic writing.

In his youth Apollinaire lived for a short while in [[Belgium]], mastering the [[Walloon language|Walloon]] dialect sufficiently to write poetry, some of which has survived.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2507">The Implementation Rules are [[regulations]] of the [[PRC]], which set the framework of the valid product [[Technical standard|standards]]. For each product group there is a specific implementation rule, which is set by the [[China|Chinese]] [[authorities]].

== Content of the Implementation Rules ==
The Implementation Rules include 12 or 13 [[chapters]], which determine the scope of the product [[certification]]. The following table provides an overview of the most common contents of the Implementation Rules:
# Scope
# Terms and definitions
# Standards for certification
# Certification pattern
# Individual product units
# Certification commission
# Certification procedure
# Certificates
# Approval procedure
# Certification logo
# Fees
# Responsibilities
# Certification rules &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.cnca.gov.cn/cnca/rdht/qzxcprz/jcjggljg/4731.html |publisher=Chinese Authority|title= 承担强制性产品认证工作的认证机构及其业务范围 (business scope of certification bodies undertaken product certifications) |deadurl=no |accessdate=2015-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Update of the Implementation Rules ==
In 2014, the Implementation Rules have been updated, so that from 2015 some changes have come into effect. For example, some product groups, which were previously grouped under one Implementation Rule, are now divided and subject to some different Implementation Rules. Furthermore, new products have been added, which are now subject to the mandatory certification. Further factory levels were introduced, so that the companies that carry out a product certification will be assigned a level (A-D) in future. Companies that receive particularly positive results on their products certification will receive level A.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.qz-online.de/news/normen-richtlinien/artikel/vier-aenderungen-bei-ccc-zertifizierungen-1063117.html?search.highlight=ccc-zertifizierung|publisher=QZ-Online|title= Vier Änderungen bei CCC-Zertifizierungen |deadurl=no |accessdate=2015-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kalo Bhari''' ([[Nepali language|Nepali]]: कालो भारी): is a type of forced labor in the era of the [[Chogyal|Namgyal dynasty]] in [[Sikkim]] where people were propelled to carry load of [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] consignment to the [[China]] via [[Tibet]].&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=Navigating Social Exclusion and Inclusion in Contemporary India and Beyond: Structures, Agents, Practices|authors=Uwe Skoda, Kenneth Bo Nielsen, Marianne Qvortrup Fibiger|date=2014|publisher=Anthem Press|isbn=9781783083404|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=V9sZBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA138&amp;dq=Kalo+Bhari&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjl0Ya8qsfKAhXEkY4KHfDhBh0Q6AEIHTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Kalo%20Bhari&amp;f=false|page=138|accessdate=2016-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ethnologically Kalo Bhari is a [[Nepali language|Nepali]] word which means black loads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sikkim-historyhunter.blogspot.in/2010/01/kalo-bhari.html|title=Kalo Bhari|website=Sikkim-historyhunter.blogspot.in|accessdate=3 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was very despotic system during Zamindari or the landlords reign in Sikkim where the citizens were subjected to all kinds of hardships.

==Evolution of the Kalo Bhari system==
The evolution of this practice was started in Sikkim after the contact with the [[British India]]. The literary meaning of the term Kalo Bhari in Nepali is Black Load.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sandeeparitar.blogspot.in/2011/05/transport-of-kalo-bhari.html|title=TRANSPORT OF “KALO BHARI”|website=Sandeeparitar.blogspot.in|accessdate=3 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; KALO BHARI [Black Load] was the name given to a special consignment compactly packed in black tarpaulin. The British sold arms and ammunitions to Tibet. The terrain and the inclement weather condition made the trading difficult. The commodities to save them from rain and snow were wrapped in card boards and put inside gunny bags bedaubed with tar. The tar protected the commodities from outside rain, and it also hid the commodities within. The black colour gave the load its local name Kalo Bhari or black load.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newarsinsikkim.weebly.com/ins-and-outs/the-newars-aspect-in-zamindari-system-in-sikkim-kalo-bhari-and-jharlange-demystified|title=THE NEWARS ASPECT IN ZAMINDARI SYSTEM IN SIKKIM : Kalo-bhari and Jharlange demystified|website=Newars in Sikkim|accessdate=3 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For specific information, see [[attorney–client privilege]] (United States); [[legal professional privilege in England and Wales]], and [[Legal professional privilege in Australia]].}}
{{Evidence law}}
In [[common law]] jurisdictions, '''legal professional privilege''' protects all communications between a professional legal adviser (a [[solicitor]], [[barrister]] or [[Lawyer|attorney]]) and his or her clients from being disclosed without the permission of the client.  The privilege is that of the client and not that of the lawyer.

The purpose behind this legal principle is to protect an individual's ability to access the justice system by encouraging complete disclosure to legal advisers without the fear that any disclosure of those communications may prejudice the client in the future.

==History==
The common law principle of legal professional privilege is of extremely long standing. The earliest recorded instance of the principle in English case-law dates from 1577 in the case of ''[[Berd v Lovelace]]&lt;ref&gt;''Berd v Lovelace'' [1577] Cary 62&lt;/ref&gt; the full report of which states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Thomas Hawtry, gentleman, was served with a subpoena to testify his knowledge touching the cause in variance; and made oath that he hath been, and yet is a solicitor in this suit, and hath received several fees of the defendant; which being informed to the [[Master of the Rolls]], it is ordered that the said Thomas Hawtry shall not be compelled to be deposed, touching the same; and that he shall be in no danger of any contempt, touching the not executing of the same process.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The principle originated as protection for individuals when accessing the knowledge and legal resources available to a lawyer and was said to stem from the "oath and honour" of the lawyer, a sort of special contractual relationship. It was based on the fact that the ordinary citizen could not safely navigate the complexities of the law and justice system without some assistance. However, without protection the quality of the advice would suffer as clients would be discouraged from making full disclosure to their legal representatives. As [[Henry Brougham, 1st Baron Brougham and Vaux|Lord Brougham]] put it in ''Greenough v Gaskell'' (1833):

&lt;blockquote&gt;''The foundation of this rule is not difficult to discover. It is not (as has sometimes been said) on account of any particular importance which the law attributes to the business of legal professors, or any particular disposition to afford them protection ... But it is out of regard to the interests of justice, which cannot be upholden, and to the administration of justice, which cannot go on without the aid of men skilled in jurisprudence, in the practice of the courts, and in those matters affecting rights and obligations which form the subject of all judicial proceedings. If the privilege did not exist at all, every one would be thrown upon his own legal resources, deprived of professional assistance, a man would not venture to consult any skilful person, or would only dare tell his counsellor half his case".''&lt;ref&gt;''Greenough v. Gaskell'' [1833], 1 M &amp; K 98&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==England and Wales==
{{Main|Legal professional privilege in England and Wales}}
In [[England and Wales]], the rules on legal professional privilege are set out in common law. The [[Civil Procedure Rules 1998]] ('CPR') Rule 31.15 establishes a right to inspect documents in civil litigation, and provide that a party to whom a document has been disclosed (i.e. mentioned or relied upon in litigation) has a right to inspect that document (if such inspection would be proportionate given the nature of the case) - except where the party making disclosure has the right to withhold such inspection.

One of these rights is legal professional privilege. It is a privilege that attaches to the client (not to the lawyer) in a client–lawyer relationship. It may only, therefore, be waived by the client. In the [[law of England and Wales]], legal professional privilege is divided into two types: advice privilege, and litigation privilege, the former category being more absolutely and broadly-defined than the latter.

==Australia==
{{Main|Legal professional privilege in Australia}}
The Evidence Act 1995 (Cth) and identical provisions in the Evidence Act 1995 of NSW and Tasmania now control when privilege prevents evidence is adduced during trial in any court (as defined by a proceeding bound by the laws of evidence). The rules of court in NSW extends the definitions in the Evidence Act to discovery and [[inspection of documents]]. The right, under legislation, has been renamed to reflect the fact that it is a right of the client. It is now client legal privilege (as opposed to legal professional privilege). The courts regard privilege as a "substantive general principle which plays an important role in the effective and efficient administration of justice by the courts",&lt;ref&gt;''Goldberg v Ng'' (1995) 185 CLR 83&lt;/ref&gt; not a mere rule of evidence. As such, it extends to all forms of compulsory disclosure, including search warrants.&lt;ref&gt;MM v Australian Crime Commission [2007]FCA 2026, [34]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Baker v Campbell'' (1983) 153 CLR 52&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, although the legislature may restrict privilege "the law [shouldn't] ease the way for the legislature to [restrict privilege]".&lt;ref&gt;''Baker'' at 131&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Canada==
Solicitor–client privilege was initially a common law [[evidence (law)|evidentiary]] principle similar to [[Hearsay in English law|hearsay]], but has since become recognized as a substantive rule that is constitutionally protected. This recognition began with ''[[R. v. Solosky]]'' (1979) where Justice [[Brian Dickson|Dickson]], in tracing its history, regarded it as a "fundamental civil and legal right" that guaranteed clients a right to privacy in their communications with their lawyers even outside a courtroom.&lt;ref&gt;''Solosky'', at 839&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[R. v. McClure]]'' [2001] 1 S.C.R. 445, the Court found that solicitor–client privilege was a [[principle of fundamental justice]], hinting that it may be protected under section 7 of the ''[[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|Charter]]''.

In its general sense, Canada has adopted [[John Wigmore]]'s definition of solicitor client privilege:
:''Where legal advice of any kind is sought from a professional legal adviser in his capacity as such, the communications relating to that purpose, made in confidence by the client, are at his instance permanently protected from disclosure by himself or by the legal adviser, except the protection be waived.''&lt;ref&gt;Evidence in Trials at Common Law, vol. 8 (McNaughton rev. 1961) at p. 543&lt;/ref&gt;

Justice Lamer set out the test for solicitor–client privilege in ''[[Decoteaux v. Mierzwinski]]'':&lt;ref&gt;p. 875&lt;/ref&gt;
:''1. The confidentiality of communications between solicitor and client may be raised in any circumstances where such communications are likely to be disclosed without the client's consent.
:''2. Unless the law provides otherwise, when and to the extent that the legitimate exercise of a right would interfere with another person's right to have his communications with his lawyer kept confidential, the resulting conflict should be resolved in favour of protecting the confidentiality.
:''3. When the law gives someone the authority to do something which, in the circumstances of the case, might interfere with that confidentiality, the decision to do so and the choice of means of exercising that authority should be determined with a view to not interfering with it except to the extent absolutely necessary in order to achieve the ends sought by the enabling legislation.
:''4. Acts providing otherwise in situations under paragraph 2 and enabling legislation referred to in paragraph 3 must be interpreted restrictively.

==In the United States==
{{Main|Attorney–client privilege}}
'''Attorney–client privilege''' is a legal concept that protects communications between a client and his or her [[Lawyer|attorney]] and keeps those communications confidential, in both civil and criminal cases.  This [[Privilege (evidence)|privilege]] encourages open and honest communication between clients and attorneys.  However, in the [[United States]], not all state courts treat attorney communications as privileged.  For instance, Washington state law, and the federal courts when applying federal law, only protect client communications&amp;mdash;an attorney's communication will only be protected as privileged to the extent it contains or reveals the client's communications.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}  In contrast, California state law protects the attorney's confidential communications regardless of whether they contain, refer to or reveal the client's communications. In addition, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] has ruled that the privilege generally does not terminate upon the client's [[death]]. See ''[[Swidler &amp; Berlin v. United States]]''.&lt;ref&gt;524 U.S. 399 (1998).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exceptions==
Privilege cannot be relied upon where the communication is used to facilitate a crime.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}&lt;ref&gt;In the UK: Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 section 10(2)&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''list of Oregon ballot measures''' lists all statewide ballot measures to the present.

In [[Oregon]], the [[initiative]] and [[referendum]] process dates back to 1902, when the efforts of the [[Direct Legislation League]] prompted amending the [[Oregon Constitution]] for the first time since 1859. The process of initiative and referendum became nationally known as the ''Oregon System''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://sos.oregon.gov/blue-book/Pages/facts/history/state-oregon.aspx Oregon Blue Book: Oregon History: The Oregon System&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="OBB Initiative"&gt;{{cite web | title = Initiative, Referendum and Recall Introduction | work = Oregon Blue Book | publisher = Salem, Oregon: Oregon Secretary of State | year = 2006 | url = hhttps://sos.oregon.gov/blue-book/Pages/state/elections/history-introduction.aspx | accessdate = 2007-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three types of [[ballot measures]]: initiatives, referendums, and referrals. Initiatives and referendums may be placed on the ballot if their supporters gather enough signatures from Oregon voters; the number of signatures is a percentage based on the number of voters casting ballots in the most recent election for the [[Governor of Oregon]].

; initiative: Any issue may be placed before the voters, either amending the Constitution or revising or adding to the [[Oregon Revised Statutes]]. Constitutional initiatives require the signature of eight percent of recent voters to qualify for the ballot; statutory reforms require six percent.
; referendum: The public may act to undo any bill passed by the [[Oregon Legislative Assembly]], by putting a referendum on the ballot. A referendum requires four percent of recent voters to qualify for the ballot.
; referral: The Legislative Assembly may refer any bill it passes to the public for approval, and must do so for any amendment to the Constitution. Additionally, the Legislative Assembly may refer revisions to the Constitution; a revision differs from an amendment in that it may alter multiple provisions of the Constitution.

The constitutional foundation for ballot measures (and legislation produced by the [[Oregon Legislative Assembly]]) may be found in [[s:Oregon Constitution/Article IV|Article IV of the Oregon Constitution]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://sos.oregon.gov/blue-book/Pages/state-constitution.aspx Article IV of the Oregon Constitution], from the [[Oregon Blue Book]].&lt;/ref&gt; and Chapter 250 of the [[Oregon Revised Statutes]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.oregonlegislature.gov/bills_laws/ors/ors250.html Chapter 250 — Initiative and Referendum], Oregon Revised Statutes&lt;/ref&gt; relates to initiative and referendum as well.

The [[Oregon Blue Book]], produced by the Oregon government, maintains a list similar to this one.&lt;ref&gt;[https://sos.oregon.gov/blue-book/Pages/state/elections/history-introduction.aspx Oregon Election History: Initiative, Referendum, and Recall]. Oregon Blue Book (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the fall election, [[Oregon Ballot Measure 36 (2004)|Measure 36]] (outlawing gay marriage) dominated public attention: 81,667 (or 4.7%) more votes were cast on Measure 36 than the average of all other measures on the ballot. [[Oregon Ballot Measure 37 (2004)|Measure 37]] (restricting land use regulation) was contentious before the election, and became more controversial after the fact, as state and local governments attempted to implement it.

Two other measures passed in 2004, both referred by the Legislature for the General Election, and neither one drawing any opposition in the Voters' Pamphlet. Measure 31 made it possible to postpone certain elections in the event of a candidate's death, and Measure 32 changed the way revenue from mobile home taxes is handled.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wweek.com/story.php?story=5609 Willamette Week | “ELECTION 2004” | October 13, 2004&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===2006===
{{see also|Oregon state elections, 2006}}

In 2006, voters considered 11 statewide ballot measures. All were placed on the ballot by initiative.

Nearly all the measures were defeated. Measures extending prescription drug pricing benefits (Measure 44) and restricting the government's power of eminent domain (39) were the only ones that passed without qualification; a campaign finance reform system (47) passed as well, but a companion measure (46) that would have provided necessary constitutional support for it failed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news
|last=Carter
|first=Steven
|title=Oregon voters make 2006 a year of 'no'
|publisher=[[The Oregonian]]
|date=November 8, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Out-of-state interests spent millions of dollars supporting—and in one significant case, opposing—Oregon ballot measures. None of these big-money measures passed; in fact, Measures 39 and 44 passed without drawing any organized opposition.&lt;ref name="MiPRAO071018"&gt;{{cite press release

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Unsuccessful measures====
[[Oregon Ballot Measure 41 (2006)|Measures 41]] and [[Oregon Ballot Measure 48 (2006)|48]] aimed to restrict the amount of money the State government could raise and spend, respectively. They were both mostly funded by the Taxpayers Association of Oregon, which in turn received nearly all its funding from Illinois-based [[Americans for Limited Government]]. Opposition to these two measures was paired as well, spending $1.9 million to defeat the two measures.&lt;ref name="MiPRAO071018"/&gt;

Measure 42 was promoted by conservative ballot measure activist [[Bill Sizemore]]. Sizemore broke with his custom by promoting a consumer-oriented bill, which would have outlawed the use of credit data in determining insurance premiums. Opponents of the measure spent over $3.7 million (nearly all of which came from out of state), defeating the measure. Their advertising focused heavily on Sizemore's credibility. Sizemore did not run an active campaign promoting the measure. He and his longtime political ally [[Loren Parks]] were the only people to submit arguments in favor for the Voters' Guide.&lt;ref&gt;[https://sos.oregon.gov/elections/Pages/electionhistory.aspx Arguments in Favor] from 2006 General Election Voters' Guide&lt;/ref&gt;

Measure 45, almost entirely financed by $1.2 million from Illinois-based [[U.S. Term Limits]], would have established strict term limits in the [[Oregon Legislative Assembly]]. Term limits had previously been in place in the late 1990s, but the prior law was declared unconstitutional by the [[Oregon Supreme Court]]. The measure failed.

[[Oregon Ballot Measures 46 and 47 (2006)|Measures 46 and 47]] were presented as a single package; 46 would have amended the Constitution to allow limitations on campaign financing (heavily favoring popular vote, and requiring a 75% vote for such changes in the Legislature); and 47 detailed specific limitations. Measure 47 passed, but in the absence of the kind of Constitutional support Measure 46 would have provided, it will have no effect. The campaigns both for and against this package were funded almost entirely from Oregon sources.

Measure 40 sought to require that judges of the [[Oregon Supreme Court]] be elected by district, rather than statewide.

Measure 43 sought to require parental notification in the event of certain teenage abortions. (Two measures restricting abortion were also rejected in the 1990 general election.)

====Successful measures====
[[Oregon Ballot Measure 39 (2006)|Measure 39]], described by its proponents as a natural extension of 2004's [[Oregon Ballot Measure 37 (2004)|Measure 37]], restricted the governments powers of [[eminent domain]]. [[Oregon Ballot Measure 44 (2006)|Measure 44]] extended a state prescription drug benefit, previously only available to seniors, to cover all uninsured Oregonians.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31652">{{NFL Labor Relations}}
The '''NFL Collective Bargaining Agreement''' ('''CBA''') is a [[labour law|labor agreement]] which reflects the results of collective bargaining negotiations between the [[National Football League Players Association]] (NFLPA) and [[National Football League]] (NFL) team owners. The labor agreement classifies distribution of league revenues, sets health and safety standards and establishes benefits, including pensions and medical benefits, for all players in the NFL.  The first collective bargaining agreement was reached in 1968 after player members of the NFLPA voted to go on strike to increase salaries, pensions and benefits for all players in the league. Later negotiations of the collective bargaining agreement called for injury grievances, a guaranteed percentage of revenues for players, an expansion of [[free agent|free agency]] and other issues impacting the business of the NFL. The NFLPA and team owners have negotiated seven different agreements since 1968.

Most recently, in 2011, players and team owners reached a collective bargaining agreement after a player [[2011 NFL lockout|lockout]] and court-ordered mediation. The currently active agreement was ratified in 2011 and extends through the 2020 season, and includes changes to league revenue distribution, increases in player benefits and health and safety improvements including major limits on offseason, preseason and regular season practice activities.

==1968 agreement==
In 1968 the National Football League Players Association was first recognized in writing by National Football League team owners. This occurred after the player members of the NFLPA voted to go on strike, intending to pressure owners to increase minimum salaries, pensions and other [[Employee benefits|benefits]] for all players.&lt;ref name=Bell11&gt;{{cite web |url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/football/nfl/2011-03-03-nfl-labor-disputes-timeline_N.htm |title=Timeline of NFL labor disputes |author=Jarrett Bell |date=March 12, 2011 |work=[[USA Today]] |accessdate=August 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, [[List of NFL franchise owners|NFL team owners]] locked out the players who were on strike.&lt;ref name=Bell11&gt;{{cite web |url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/football/nfl/2011-03-03-nfl-labor-disputes-timeline_N.htm |title=Timeline of NFL labor disputes |author=Jarrett Bell |date=March 12, 2011 |work=[[USA Today]] |accessdate=August 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; After eleven days of work stoppage, the first [[collective bargaining]] agreement (CBA) was reached between the NFL and the NFLPA.&lt;ref name=ESPN11&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?page=nfl_labor_history |title=NFL labor history since 1968 |date=March 3, 2011 |work=espn.com |publisher=[[ESPN]] |accessdate=August 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Rothschild11&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.si.com/more-sports/2011/07/26/labor-scorecard |title=Players vs. owners: Who came out on top in major labor disputes? |author=Richard Rothschild |date=July 26, 2011 |work=si.com |publisher=[[Sports Illustrated]] |accessdate=August 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The agreement set a minimum salary of $9,000 per year for rookie players and $10,000 per year for veteran players.

==1974 strike==

==1993 agreement==
The NFL and its players began negotiations after players won the [[Freeman McNeil]] legal case brought against Plan B. The jury decided on September 10, 1992 that Plan B was too restrictive under federal antitrust laws. Subsequently, team owners agreed to discuss free agency for all players.&lt;ref name=Bell11&gt;{{cite web |url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/football/nfl/2011-03-03-nfl-labor-disputes-timeline_N.htm |title=Timeline of NFL labor disputes |author=Jarrett Bell |date=March 12, 2011 |work=[[USA Today]] |accessdate=August 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NFLPA filed a class action suit in the name of [[Reggie White]], claiming that all players in the NFL should receive money damages as a result of the illegality of Plan B.

The '''National Electoral Council''' ({{lang-es|Consejo Nacional Electoral, CNE}}) is a [[Colombia]]n institution under the [[Colombian Constitution of 1991]] which based in Article 265 is in charge of the supreme inspection and vigilance of the [[election|electoral organization]]. The National Electoral Council is supposed to know and decide when and where an election is going to take place. The entity also watches over the [[List of political parties in Colombia|Colombian political parties]] and political movements, their publicity and marketing, polls to guarantee the opposition or minorities also achieve a fair political aspiration. 

The National Electoral Council also oversees the financing of political campaigns and the rights of citizens to participate in politics within the law. After every election the electoral council is also in charge of counting the votes and determine within the law and rules the overall winners and accredit them with an official identification. The council also must recognize parties and political movements as [[Legal person|legal entities]] and collaborate with the performing of internal research polls within the political parties and political movements through the government owned media.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2899">[[File:Labor Mobilization in Japanese Empire.JPG|right|thumb|200px|Labor Mobilization, 1944]]{{nihongo|'''National Mobilization Law'''|国家総動員法|Kokka Sōdōin Hō}} was legislated in the [[Diet of Japan]] by [[Prime Minister of Japan|Prime Minister]] [[Fumimaro Konoe]] on 24 March 1938 to put the national economy of the [[Empire of Japan]] on war-time footing after the start of the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]].

The National Mobilization Law had fifty clauses, which provided for government controls over civilian organizations (including [[labor union]]s), [[nationalization]] of strategic industries, [[price controls]] and [[rationing]], and nationalized the [[news media]].&lt;ref&gt;Pauer, Japan's War Economy, pp.13&lt;/ref&gt; The laws gave the government the authority to use unlimited budgets to subsidize war production, and to compensate manufacturers for losses caused by war-time mobilization. Eighteen of the fifty articles outlined penalties for violators.

The law was attacked as unconstitutional when introduced to the Diet in January 1938, but was passed due to strong pressure from the [[Imperial Japanese Army|military]] and took effect from May 1938. It was abolished on 20 December 1945 by the [[Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers|American occupation authorities]] after the [[surrender of Japan]].

The {{nihongo|'''National Service Draft Ordinance'''|国民徴用令|Kokumin Choyo rei}} was a supplemental law promulgated by Prime Minister Konoe as part of the National Mobilization Law. It empowered the government to draft civilian workers to ensure an adequate supply of labor in strategic [[war industry|war industries]], with exceptions allowed only in the case of the [[Disability|physically handicapped]] or [[mentally handicapped]].

The program was organized under the Ministry of Welfare, and at its peak 1,600,000 men and women were drafted, and 4,500,000 workers were reclassified as draftees (and thus were unable to quit their jobs). The Ordinance was superseded by the '''National Labor Service Mobilization Law''' in March 1945, which was in turn abolished on 20 December 1945 by the [[Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers]] after the [[surrender of Japan]].

The '''Natural Resources Acts''' were a series of Acts passed by the Parliament of Canada and the provinces of [[Alberta]], [[British Columbia]], [[Manitoba]] and [[Saskatchewan]] in 1930 to transfer control over [[crown lands]] and [[natural resources]] within these provinces from the federal government to the provincial governments.  Alberta,&lt;ref&gt;''[[s:Alberta Act|Alberta Act]]'', S.C. 1905, c. 3, s. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; Manitoba&lt;ref&gt;''[[s:Manitoba Act, 1870|Manitoba Act, 1870]]'', S.C. 1870, c. 3, s. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; and Saskatchewan&lt;ref&gt;''[[s:Saskatchewan Act|Saskatchewan Act]]'', S.C. 1905, c. 42, s. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; had not been given control over their natural resources  when they entered [[Canadian Confederation|Confederation]], unlike the other Canadian provinces.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/Const/page-6.html#s_102 Constitution Act, 1867]'', 30 &amp; 31 Victoria, c. 3. (U.K.), R.S.C. 1985, App. II, No. 11, s. 109.&lt;/ref&gt;  British Columbia had surrendered certain portions of its natural resources and Crown lands to the federal government, the [[Railway Belt (British Columbia)|Railway Belt]] and the [[Peace River Block]], when it entered Confederation in 1871,&lt;ref&gt;''[[s:British Columbia Terms of Union|British Columbia Terms of Union (1871)]]'', clause 10.&lt;/ref&gt; as part of the agreement for the building of the transcontinental railway.

Following protracted negotiations, in 1930 the federal government and the four provinces reached a series of agreements for the transfer of the administration of the natural resources to the provincial governments, called the Natural Resources Transfer Agreements.  Parliament&lt;ref&gt;''Alberta Natural Resources Act'', S.C. 1930, c. 3;  ''Railway Belt and Peace River Block Act'', S.C, 1930, c. 37;  ''Manitoba Natural Resources Act'', S.C. 1930, c. 29;    ''Saskatchewan Natural Resources Act'', S.C. 1930, c. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; and the four provincial legislatures&lt;ref&gt;''An Act to ratify a certain Agreement between the Government of the Dominion of Canada, represented therein by the Honourable Ernest Lapointe, Minister of Justice, and the Honourable Charles Stewart, Minister of the Interior, of the first part, and the Government of the Province of Saskatchewan, represented therein by the Honourable James Thomas Milton Anderson, Premier and Minister of Education of the Province, and the Honourable Murdoch Alexander MacPherson, Attorney-General, of the second part'', S.S. 1930, c. 87.&lt;/ref&gt; then passed acts to implement the agreements.  Finally, the British Parliament passed the ''Constitution Act, 1930'',&lt;ref&gt;''[[s:Constitution Act, 1930|Constitution Act, 1930]]'', 20 &amp; 21 George V, c. 26 (U.K.).&lt;/ref&gt; to ratify the agreements, entrenching them in the [[Constitution of Canada]].  The passage of these Acts rendered the ''[[Dominion Lands Act]]'' obsolete, since these same lands were no longer under federal jurisdiction.

A few small sections of resource-rich territory were excluded from the act, although they would be transferred later. [[First Nations]] reserves and lands reserved for indigenous persons were excluded under the ''[[Indian Act]]''. [[National park]]s were also excluded - they remain under the jurisdiction of the federal government, and are generally off-limits to resource development.

}}

'''Pacta conventa''' ([[Latin]] for "agreed accords") was an alleged agreement concluded between King [[Coloman of Hungary]] and the [[Croatian nobility]] in 1102 or afterwards, defining the status of [[Croatia in the union with Hungary]]. The earliest manuscript of the document is of the fourteenth century.

The document titled ''Pacta conventa'' or ''Qualiter'' (the first word in the document) was found in a [[Trogir]] library.&lt;ref name="mdc-trogir-museum"/&gt; Until the 19th century it was considered that it dated to 1102. However, most historians today hold that it is not an authentic document from 1102 and likely a forgery from the 14th century, but that the contents of the Pacta Conventa still correspond to the political situation of that time in Croatia.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;Pál Engel: [https://books.google.com/books?id=vEJNBqanT_8C ''Realm of St. Stephen: A History of Medieval Hungary''], 2005, p. 35-36&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bárány"&gt;Bárány, Attila (2012). "The Expansion of the Kingdom of Hungary in the Middle Ages (1000–  1490)". In Berend, Nóra. The Expansion of Central Europe in the Middle Ages. Ashgate Variorum.  page 344-345&lt;/ref&gt; The document is preserved in the [[Hungarian National Museum]] in [[Budapest]].&lt;ref name="Herc"&gt;[[Eduard Hercigonja]], ''Tropismena i trojezična kultura hrvatskoga srednjovjekovlja'', [[Matica hrvatska]], Zagreb, 2006. {{ISBN|953-150-766-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
After [[Petar Svačić]], the last Croatian king of Croat descent, was killed on the battlefield in 1097, the Croats had refused to surrender.&lt;ref&gt;Hrvoje Hitrec; Hrvatska povjesnica; in Croatian&lt;/ref&gt; To end the war, an agreement was made, probably in 1102. The Croatian nobles allegedly concluded the ''Pacta conventa'' with King [[Coloman of Hungary|Coloman]] before his crowning as the Croatian king in Biograd.&lt;ref name="Curta, Stephenson, p. 267"&gt;[[#Curta-2006|Curta, Stephenson, 2006]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=YIAYMNOOe0YC&amp;pg=RA3-PA267 p. 267]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hungarian king offered "an agreement as pleases them" to the [[Croatian nobility|twelve noble Croatian tribes]] from the families of [[Kačić family|Kačić]], [[Kukar family|Kukar]], [[Šubić]], [[Snačić family|Snačić]], [[Polečić]], [[Mogorović family|Mogorović]], [[Gusić family|Gusić]], [[Čudomirić family|Čudomirić]], Karinjan and [[Lapčan family|Lapčan]], [[Lisničić]], [[Jamomet family|Jamometić]] and [[Tugomirić family|Tugomirić]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.hrvatski-vojnik.hr/hrvatski-vojnik/0732006/podlistak.asp | title=Posljednji kralj hrvatskoga roda | journal=[[Hrvatski vojnik]] | issue=73 |date=February 2006 | language=Croatian |last=Miletić | first=Jurica | accessdate=5 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terms==
The agreement determined that the Croatian nobles who signed the document with King [[Coloman of Hungary|Coloman]] would retain their possessions and properties without interference. It also granted the mentioned families exemption from tax or tributes to the king. Each of the [[Croatian nobility|twelve noble Croatian tribes]] were obliged to answer the king's call if someone attacked his borders and send at least ten armed horsemen to war, as far as the Drava River ([[Kingdom of Croatia (medieval)|Croatia]]'s northern boundary with [[Kingdom of Hungary (1000–1526)|Hungary]]) at their own expense. Beyond that point, the Hungarian king paid the expenses.&lt;ref&gt;Jean W. Sedlar: East Central Europe in the Middle Ages, 1000-1500, University of Washington Press, 2011, p. 77. {{ISBN|029580064X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Trpimir Macan: Povijest hrvatskog naroda, 1971, p. 71 (full text of Pacta conventa in Croatian)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ferdo Šišić: Priručnik izvora hrvatske historije, Dio 1, čest 1, do god. 1107., Zagreb 1914., p. 527-528 (full text of Pacta conventa in Latin)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Validity of the document itself==
The document's validity is questionable.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fine|2006|p=71}}&lt;/ref&gt; While some claim the earliest text concerning the alleged agreement came from the second half of the 14th century&lt;ref name="Curta, Stephenson, p. 267"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fine, p. 70"&gt;{{harvnb|Fine|2006|p=70}}&lt;/ref&gt; others call it a late medieval forgery, not a twelfth-century source.&lt;ref name="Curta, Stephenson, p. 267"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bellamy, p. 37"&gt;{{harvnb|Bellamy|2003|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While various items of the text seem anachronistic to some, other historians say these could be reworkings of a text from an actual agreement.&lt;ref name="Fine, p. 70"/&gt;

Since the 19th century, a number of historians have claimed that the ''Pacta conventa'' was not a genuine document.

In 1915 and then also in 1925, [[Milan Šufflay]] mentioned the document in some of his works, first declaring it an outright forgery, and later saying it was a 14th-century "addendum" to the manuscript of [[Thomas the Archdeacon]].&lt;ref name="Antoljak-1995"&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://hrcak.srce.hr/65458?lang=en | language = Croatian | title = Milan Sufflay kao paleograf i diplomatičar | first = Stjepan | last = Antoljak | pages = 144&amp;ndash;145 | journal = Arhivski vjesnik | number = 38 |date=November 1995 | issn = 0570-9008 | publisher = [[Croatian State Archives]] | accessdate = 2012-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hungarian historian [[János Karácsonyi]] thought it was a 14th-century forgery, Slovene historian [[Ljudmil Hauptmann]] dated the document to the 13th century, Croatian historians [[Miho Barada]] and [[Marko Kostrenčić]] thought it was made in 1102, while later Croatian historian [[Nada Klaić]] thought it was a forgery probably made in the 14th century. Croatian historian [[Stjepan Antoljak]] in turn said the ''Pacta'' was an incomplete historical source, but not a forgery.&lt;ref name="Antoljak-1995"/&gt; Nada Klaić elaborated her "lack of opinion" over the matter of 1102 in a 1959 article disputing the Croatian writer [[Oleg Mandić]]'s earlier work on the matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.historiografija.hr/hz/1960/HZ_13_27_KLAIC.pdf | language = Croatian | title = O. Mandić, "Pacta conventa" i "dvanaest" hrvatskih bratstava. | last = Klaić | first = Nada | journal = Historical Journal | publisher = Croatian Historical Society | issn = 0351-2193 | volume = XI-XII | year = 1958–59 | pages = 165&amp;ndash;206 | accessdate = 2012-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dispute and uncertainty over the ''Pacta conventa'' matches the overall uncertainty and dispute over the relationship between the Croatian and Hungarian kingdoms in the 10th and 11th century, with Croatian historian [[Ferdo Šišić]] and his followers assuming [[Tomislav of Croatia]] had ruled most of the area inhabited by Croats, including [[Slavonia]], while the Hungarian historians [[Gyula Kristó]], [[Bálint Hóman]] and János Karácsonyi thought the area between [[Drava]] and [[Sava]] belonged neither to Croatia nor to Hungary at the time, an opinion that Nada Klaić said she would not preclude, because the generic name "Slavonia" (lit. the land of the Slavs) may have implied so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://hrcak.srce.hr/index.php?show=clanak&amp;id_clanak_jezik=68144 | language = Croatian | title = Croatian-Hungarian relations from the Middle Ages to the Compromise of 1868, with a special survey of the Slavonian issue | first = Ladislav | last = Heka | page = 155 | journal = Scrinia Slavonica | volume = 8 | number = 1 |date=October 2008 | issn = 1332-4853 | publisher = Croatian Historical Institute - Department of History of Slavonia, Srijem and Baranja | location = Slavonski Brod | accessdate = 2012-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the validity of the document is disputed, there was at least a non-written agreement that regulated the relations between Hungary and Croatia in approximately the same way, since from 1102 until 1918 kings of Hungary were also kings of Croatia, represented by a governor (ban), but Croatia kept its own parliament (Sabor) and considerable autonomy.&lt;ref name=Encarta&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Croatia (History)|url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761577939_6/Croatia.html#p40|encyclopedia=[[Encarta]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The source of inspiration for the text of the document must have been the political and social developments that had taken place over a 300-year period following 1102&lt;ref name="Curta, Stephenson, p. 267"/&gt; when the two kingdoms united under the Hungarian king, either by the choice of the Croat nobility or by Hungarian force.&lt;ref name=Encarta/&gt; The Croatian nobility retained its laws and privileges including the restriction of military service that they owed to the king within the boundaries of Croatia.&lt;ref name="Curta, Stephenson, p. 267"/&gt;

==Interpretations of the agreement==

According to the [[Library of Congress]] country study on the former Yugoslavia, King Coloman crushed opposition after the death of [[Ladislaus I of Hungary]] and won the crown of Dalmatia and Croatia in 1102.&lt;ref name=Congress&gt;{{harvnb|Curtis|1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; The crowning of Coloman forged a link between the Croatian and Hungarian crowns that lasted until the end of World War I.&lt;ref name=Congress/&gt; Croatians have maintained for centuries that Croatia remained a sovereign state despite the voluntary union of the two crowns.&lt;ref name="Bellamy, p. 37"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Congress/&gt;&lt;ref name="Singleton, p. 29"&gt;{{harvnb|Singleton|1985|p=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of Hungarian historians also accept the view that Croatia and Hungary entered in a personal union in 1102&lt;ref name=Barany&gt;Bárány, Attila (2012).

In the eyes of Croatians, Croatia was a separate state which happened to share a ruler with the Hungarians. The degree of Croatian autonomy fluctuated from time to time, as well as its borders.&lt;ref name="Singleton, p. 29"/&gt; According to Daniel Power, Croatia became part of Hungary in the late 11th and early twelfth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Power|2006|p=186}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the country study on Hungary Croatia was never assimilated into Hungary; rather, it became an associate kingdom administered by a ban, or civil governor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://countrystudies.us/hungary/7.htm Stephen R. Burant, ed. Hungary: A Country Study. Washington: GPO for the Library of Congress, 1989]&lt;/ref&gt; In either case, Hungarian culture permeated Croatia, the Croatian-Hungarian border shifted often, and at times Hungary treated Croatia as a vassal state.&lt;ref name=Congress/&gt;

In 1105 Coloman granted privileges to maritime cities in exchange for their submission. These included the election of their own bishops and priors which is later only confirmed by the king, prohibition of Hungarians settling in towns. Also, the cities did not pay tribute, while royal agents supervised the collection of custom duties without interfering in local politics.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Curta-2006|Curta, Stephenson, 2006]], p. 266&lt;/ref&gt;

While Croatian historian [[Nada Klaić]] thinks that some sort of surrender occurred in 1102, giving the Croatians light terms,&lt;ref name=Michigan&gt;{{harvnb|Fine|1991|p=285}}&lt;/ref&gt; Slovenian historians Matjaž Klemenčič and Mitja Žagar believe the Pacta Conventa never actually existed, but the story about it was important to support the Croatian position later in the [[Habsburg Empire]] of rights on the basis of that agreement.&lt;ref name=ABC&gt;{{cite book|author=Matjaž Klemenčič, Mitja Žagar|title=The Former Yugoslavia's Diverse Peoples: A Reference Sourcebook|publisher=[[ABC-CLIO]]|year=2004|isbn=978-1-57607-294-3|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Klemenčič and Žagar think that although Croatia ceased to exist as an independent state, the Croatian nobility retained relatively strong powers.&lt;ref name=ABC/&gt;  Klaić thinks that the Trogir manuscript, the earliest text of the alleged pact, is not the text of that surrender, but describes contemporary relations between king and nobility and then traced that current 14th century reality back to an initial agreement.&lt;ref name=Michigan/&gt;

Unlike Hungarian historians, the Austrians never claimed they conquered Croatia by force and there appears to be little reason to doubt Croatian claims about the events of 1526.&lt;ref name="Bellamy, p. 39"/&gt;

{{Patriot Act titles}}
The [[USA PATRIOT Act]] was passed by the United States [[United States Congress|Congress]] in 2001 as a response to the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]]. It has ten titles, each containing numerous sections. '''Title II: Enhanced Surveillance Procedures''' granted increased powers of [[surveillance]] to various government agencies and bodies. This title has 25 sections, with one of the sections (section 224) containing a [[sunset clause]] which sets an expiration date, December 31, 2005, for most of the title's provisions. This was extended twice: on December 22, 2005 the sunset clause expiration date was extended to February 3, 2006 and on February 2 of the same year it was again extended, this time to March 10.

Title II contains many of the most contentious provisions of the act.  Supporters of the Patriot Act claim that these provisions are necessary in fighting the [[War on Terrorism]], while its detractors argue that many of the sections of Title II infringe upon Constitutionally protected [[individual rights|individual]] and [[civil rights]].

The sections of Title II amend the [[Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act]] of 1978 and its provisions in [[United States Code|18 U.S.C.]], dealing with "Crimes and [[Criminal Procedure]]". It also amends the [[Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986]]. In general, the Title expands federal agencies' powers in intercepting, sharing, and using private telecommunications, especially electronic communications, along with a focus on criminal investigations by updating the rules that govern computer crime investigations. It also sets out procedures and limitations for individuals who feel their rights have been violated to seek redress, including against the United States government. However, it also includes a section that deals with [[trade sanction]]s against countries whose government supports terrorism, which is not directly related to surveillance issues.

==Overview==
{{main|Section summary of the USA PATRIOT Act, Title II}}
Title II covers all aspects of the surveillance of suspected terrorists, those suspected of engaging in computer fraud or abuse, and agents of a foreign power who are engaged in clandestine activities (in other words, spying). In particular, the title allows government agencies to gather "foreign intelligence information" from both US and non-US citizens, which is defined in [[Detailed breakdown of the USA PATRIOT Act, Title II#Section 203: Authority to share criminal investigative information|section 203]] of the title. [[Section summary of the USA PATRIOT Act, Title II#Section 218: Foreign intelligence information|Section 218]] changed the requirements to obtain a FISA surveillance to include that a ''"significant purpose'''' of the surveillance is to "obtain foreign intelligence information" where formerly it was required to be ''"the primary purpose."'' The change in definition was meant to remove a legal "wall" between criminal investigations and surveillance for the purposes of gathering foreign intelligence, which hampered investigations when criminal and foreign surveillance overlapped. However, that this wall even existed was found by the [[United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of Review|Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of Review]] to have actually been a long-held misinterpretation by government agencies. Section 203 also gave authorities the ability to share information gathered before a federal [[grand jury]] with other agencies.

Though not related to surveillance, the title also covers trade sanctions against the [[Taliban]] — a group which was determined by the [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] to have repeatedly provided support for acts of international terrorism – and the export of agricultural commodities, medicine, or medical devices is now pursuant to one-year licenses issued and reviewed by the United States Government. It also excluded export of agricultural commodities, medicine, or medical devices to the Government of [[Syria]] and to the Government of [[North Korea]].

===Scope of allowed surveillance===
The title allows surveillance to intercept communications via [[pen register]] or [[trap and trace device]]s. It does not allow these surveillance measures to be used in violation of the [[First Amendment rights]] of U.S. citizens. To assist in an investigation undertaken to protect against international terrorism or clandestine intelligence activities, the title allows for the seizure of communications records ([[Detailed breakdown of USA PATRIOT Act, Title II#Section 215: Access to records and other items under FISA|section 215]]) and any records of session times, durations of electronic communication as well as any identifying numbers or addresses of the equipment that was being used ([[Detailed breakdown of USA PATRIOT Act, Title II#Section 210: Scope of subpoenas for records of electronic communications|section 210]]). Such orders may be granted ''[[ex parte]]'', and once they are granted – in order to not jeopardize the investigation – the order may not disclose the reasons behind why the order was granted. [[Detailed breakdown of USA PATRIOT Act, Title II#Section 209: Seizure of voice-mail messages pursuant to warrants|Section 209]] made it easier for authorities to gain access to voicemail as they no longer must apply for a wiretap order, and instead just apply for a normal search warrant.

All orders granted under section 215 must be disclosed to the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence of the House of Representatives and the Select Committee on Intelligence of the Senate. Every six months, the Attorney General must also provide a report to the Committees on the Judiciary of the House of Representatives and the Senate which details the total number of applications made for orders approving requests for the production of tangible things and the total number of such orders either granted, modified, or denied.

Under [[Detailed breakdown of USA PATRIOT Act, Title II#Section 211: Scope of subpoenas for records of electronic communications|section 211]], the [[United States Code]] was amended to allow the government to have access to the records of cable customers, with the notable exclusion of access to records revealing cable subscriber selection of video programming from a cable operator.

===Disclosure===
[[Detailed breakdown of USA PATRIOT Act, Title II#Section 212: Emergency disclosure of electronic communications|Section 212]] stopped a communications provider from disclosing the contents of communications with another party. However, if the provider "reasonably" (not defined) believes that an emergency involving immediate danger of death or serious physical injury to any person is imminent, then the communications provider can now disclose this information without fear of liability. The provider may also disclose communications at the request of a government agency, if the customer allows it to be disclosed, or in cases where they must do so to protect their rights or property. Section 212 was later repealed by the [[Homeland Security Act of 2002]] and was replaced with a new and permanent emergency disclosure provision.

===Surveillance orders===
In order for surveillance to be carried out, the [[United States Attorney General]] or his subordinates (so designated under [[Detailed breakdown of USA PATRIOT Act, Title II#Sections 201 &amp; 202: Intercepting communications|section 201]]) may authorize a [[United States federal judge|federal judge]] to grant a surveillance order to the FBI or other Federal agency. Each of the orders granted must be reviewed by one of 11 [[United States district court|district court]] judges, of which at any one time three must live within 20 miles of the [[District of Columbia]] (see [[#Section 208: Designation of judges|section 208]]).

Title II amended the U.S. Code to allow a magistrate judge to issue a warrant outside of their district for any orders that relate to terrorism ([[Detailed breakdown of USA PATRIOT Act, Title II#Section 219: Single-jurisdiction search warrants for terrorism|section 219]]). [[#Section 220: Nationwide service of search warrants for electronic evidence|Section 220]] of the title also gave a Federal court judge the power to issue nationwide service of search warrants for electronic surveillance.

Under FISA, any agency may require a [[common carrier]], landlord, custodian, or other person provide them with all information, facilities, or technical assistance necessary to accomplish ongoing electronic surveillance. They must also protect the secrecy of and cause as little disruption to the ongoing surveillance effort as possible. This was further tightened in [[Detailed breakdown of USA PATRIOT Act, Title II#Section 206: Roving surveillance authority|section 206]]. [[Detailed breakdown of USA PATRIOT Act, Title II#Section 222: Assistance to law enforcement agencies|Section 222]] further limited the sort of assistance an agency may require, and provided for compensation of any person who rendered surveillance assistance to the government agency. [[Detailed breakdown of USA PATRIOT Act, Title II#Section 225: Immunity for compliance with FISA wiretap|Section 225]] allows for [[Immunity from prosecution|legal immunity]] to any provider of a wire or electronic communication service, landlord, custodian, or other person that provides any information, facilities, or technical assistance in accordance with a court order or request for emergency assistance.

===Liability due to unauthorized surveillance===
[[Detailed breakdown of USA PATRIOT Act, Title II#Section 223: Civil liability for certain unauthorized disclosures|Section 223]] allows any party who has had their rights violated due to the illegal interception of communications to take [[civil action]] against any party who undertook the illegal surveillance.

===Sunset===
{{update|date=November 2010}}

Section 224 (''Sunset'') is a [[sunset clause]]. Title II and the amendments made by the title originally would have ceased to have effect on December 31, 2005, with the exception of the below sections. However, on December 22, 2005, the sunset clause expiration date was extended to February 3, 2006, and then on February 2, 2006 it was further extended to March 10:

==Commentary==
Various organizations have commented on Title II. Some of the most significant commentary has come from the [[Electronic Privacy Information Center]] (EPIC), the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] (EFF), the [[American Bar Association]] (ABA), the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU) and from the [[United States government]].

===American Bar Association===
{{main|Patriot Debates}}
&lt;!-- no separate rationale for this article [[Image:PatriotDebate book.png|frame|The U.S. Bar Association published the Patriot Debates in book form.]] --&gt;
The ABA passed [[Resolution (policy debate)|resolution]]s that asked the U.S. government "to conduct a thorough review of the implementation of the powers granted to the Executive Branch under the [USA PATRIOT] Act before considering legislation that would extend or further expand such powers ...." and "to conduct regular and timely oversight including public hearings ... to ensure that government investigations undertaken pursuant to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act ... do not violate the First, Fourth, and Fifth Amendments of the Constitution ...." They also set up a website, [http://apps.americanbar.org/natsecurity/patriotdebates/ Patriot Debates] to discuss issues in relation to the [[USA PATRIOT Act]]. Various people [[debate]]d specific sections of Title II in great depth on the site.

====Section 203====
[[Kate Martin (jurist)|Kate Martin]], the director of the Center for National Security Studies, argued that [[Detailed breakdown of the USA PATRIOT Act, Title II#Section 203: Authority to share criminal investigative information|section 203]] and 905 should be modified as she maintains the Act fails to discriminate between information gathered between terrorist and non-terrorist investigations. She believes that the Act should be modified to include some privacy safeguards: before information is gathered she believes that the court should approve the information transfer to make sure that it is necessary for ongoing activities by the agencies involved; that information shared should be limited to information relevant to investigations into terrorism; that only those people who have access to such information should actually need it to do their jobs (currently those who are not directly related to the investigation can gain access to the information); and information gathered should be marked as confidential and measures put into place to stop the inappropriate dissemination of such information.&lt;ref name=ABA_KateMartin203&gt;[[Kate Martin (jurist)|Kate Martin]], [http://apps.americanbar.org/natsecurity/patriotdebates/section-203#opening "Why Sections 203 and 905 Should be Modified"] (undated), accessed January 2, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Her views were opposed by [[Viet Dinh]], who believed that such alterations would hinder terrorism investigations.

====Section 206====
James X. Dempsey argued that [[Detailed breakdown of the USA PATRIOT Act, Title II#Section 206: Roving surveillance authority|Section 206]], which allows for roving surveillance under FISA, was reasonable considering that investigators already had the ability to perform roving surveillance in criminal cases. However, he says that "as with so many provisions of the PATRIOT Act, the concern with Section 206 is not with the authority itself [but] rather, the issue is the lack of adequate checks and balances". Dempsey believes that the section lacks two important safeguards that are present in the corresponding legislation for criminal investigations: 1) that agents actually ascertain the location of the suspect before turning on their recording devices, and 2) that "some additional changes to FISA adopted outside of the normal process in the Intelligence Authorization Act a few months after the PATRIOT Act had the probably unintended effect of seeming to authorize "John Doe" roving taps – that is, FISA orders that identify ''neither'' the target nor the location of the interception.". Dempsey also believes that the law should be changed so that those under surveillance via FISA should also be notified after surveillance has ceased, so that those wrongly targeted and placed under surveillance can challenge the government's actions.&lt;ref name=ABA_Section206_Dempsey&gt;[[James X. Dempsey]], [http://apps.americanbar.org/natsecurity/patriotdebates/section-206#opening "Why Section 206 Should be Modified"] (undated), accessed January 7, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Paul Rosenzweig]] disagreed with Dempsey's premise that "relaxation of the particularity requirement is constitutionally suspect" and believed that it colored his argument that section 206 should be modified. Rosenzweig believes that the addition of an ascertainment requirement and the requirement that the identification of individuals should be more specific "seem unnecessary and unwise" — in Rosenzweig's view it would unnecessarily burden the ability of law enforcement and intelligence agents to perform surveillance on terrorist suspects.

====Section 209, 212 and 220====
Dempsey also argued that [[Detailed breakdown of the USA PATRIOT Act, Title II#Section 209: Seizure of voice-mail messages pursuant to warrants|section 209]], which deals with the seizure of voicemails through the use of a normal search warrant, unnecessarily overlooked the importance of notice under the Fourth Amendment and under a Title III wiretap. He believes that there is no way to seek redress under the new provisions, as those who have an ordinary search warrant against them may never find out that their voicemail has been seized. On the now repealed [[#Section 212: Emergency disclosure of electronic communications|section 212]] and the similar current provision in the [[Homeland Security Act]], which allows for the emergency disclosure of electronic communications under certain circumstances, he believes it leaves the law open for abuse as an agency may "cut corners" by informing an ISP about a potential emergency, leading to the ISP then making emergency disclosures based on this information. Dempsey suggests several modifications to implement checks and balances into the section: make after-the-act judicial review mandatory, with the suppression of evidence which is not deemed to be properly justified; the mandatory disclosure to the person whose privacy has been invaded that their information has been provided to the government; and to "make it illegal for a government official to intentionally or recklessly mislead a service provider as to the existence of an emergency". Dempsey also believes that [[#Section 220: Nationwide service of search warrants for electronic evidence|section 220]], which allows for the nationwide service of search warrants for electronic evidence, made it "more difficult for a distant service provider to appear before the issuing court and object to legal or procedural defects". A solution suggested by Dempsey to this problem would be to allow a warrant to be challenged in the district it was served as well as in the district it was issued.&lt;ref name=ABA_DempseySection209_212_220&gt;[[James X. Dempsey]], [http://www.abanet.org/natsecurity/patriotdebates/209-212-and-220-2#opening "Why Sections 209, 212, and 220 Should be Modified"] (undated), accessed January 13, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Orin S. Kerr]] also agreed with James Dempsey that the sections were uncontroversial, but argued they should be kept. Kerr believes that "for the most part, Jim Dempsey's proposals for reform would impose greater privacy restrictions for online investigations than equivalent offline investigations". He believes that Dempsey's proposal to require after-the-act judicial review for exigent circumstances has no parallel in the Fourth Amendment; that allowing recipients of orders to challenge orders within the recipients own district would not follow "the traditional rule that any challenge (itself an extremely rare event) must be filed in the issuing district"; and that disclosure to the person whose electronic voicemail has been seized also has no such parallel in the Fourth Amendment, as while notice must be given to a home owner whose house is being searched this is not done to allow a challenge to the order but rather shows them that due legal process is being followed and that the search is not being conducted by a rogue agent – Kerr believes that "current law appears to satisfy this policy concern by providing notice to the ISP".&lt;ref name=ABA_Section209_212_220Kerr&gt;[[Orin S. Kerr]], [http://apps.americanbar.org/natsecurity/patriotdebates/209-212-and-220-2#rebuttal Orin Kerr Replies] (undated), accessed January 13, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Section 213====
[[Heather Mac Donald]] argued that [[#Section 213: Delayed search warrant notification|section 213]], which provides for the so-called "sneak and peek" provisions of the Patriot Act, is necessary because the temporary delay in notification of a search order stops terrorists from tipping off their counterparts that they are being investigated. She claims that the section allows the government to conduct secret searches without notification from such organizations as the ACLU and the [[Century Foundation]] are wrong, and listed several arguments that she believed are easily discredited. She called them: "Conceal Legal Precedent", "Hide the Judge", "Amend the Statute", and "Reject Secrecy".&lt;ref&gt;[http://apps.americanbar.org/natsecurity/patriotdebates/section-213#opening "Sneak-and-Peek in the Full Light of Day"] (undated), accessed January 13, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; James X. Dempsey countered that section 213 was a "perfect example of a good idea gone too far" and argued that secrecy was already dealt when FISA was amended in 1994 to allow the government to carry out secret searches. Dempsey objects to the fact that section 213 as enacted is not limited to terrorism cases. Dempsey believes that the section confuses the law and was hastily cobbled together – his primary example is the reference to the definition of "adverse result", which he argues was unrelated with regards to the Patriot Act's purposes. He believes the definition is too broad and "offer little guidance to judges and will bring about no national uniformity in sneak and peek cases." He also believes that "reasonable period" is too vague and that it leaves judges with no uniform standard, and may leave courts outside the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|Ninth]] and [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit|Second Circuit]] the ability to make up their own rules. He also wonders why if sneak and peak orders are a "time-honored tool" used by courts for decades, then why it was necessary for the Justice Department to push to make section 213 applicable in all cases that such a measure is used. The answer Dempsey posits is that they were on shaky constitutional ground and that they were "trying to bolster it with Congressional action – even action by a Congress that thought it was voting on an anti-terrorism bill, not a general crimes bill." Dempsey's reasons for believing that they were on shaky ground was because although the 1986 ''[[United States v. Freitas]]'', 800 F.2d 1451 (9th Cir.), and 1990, United States v. Villegas, 899 F.2d 1324 (2d Cir.) circuit opinions were premised on the assumption that notice was not an element of the Fourth Amendment, ''[[Wilson v. Arkansas]]'', 514 U.S. 927 (1995) Justice Thomas of the Supreme Court found that notice is part of the Fourth Amendment. In order to fix what he believes to be serious flaws in section 213, Dempsey proposes several changes be made to the section: the requirement for [[reasonable cause]] to be found by a judge be changed to be [[probable cause]]; that the section should not apply to every case of delayed notification and that Congress should require that any delay in notification not extend for more than seven days without additional judicial authorization.&lt;ref name=ABA_Section213Dempsey&gt;[[James X. Dempsey]], [http://apps.americanbar.org/natsecurity/patriotdebates/section-213#rebuttal James X. Dempsey replies] (undated), accessed January 13, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Section 214 and 215====
{{See also|Section summary of the Patriot Act, Title II#Section 215: Access to records and other items under FISA}}

[[Andrew C. McCarthy]] believed that sections [[Detailed breakdown of the USA PATRIOT Act, Title II#Section 214: Pen register and trap and trace authority|214]] (deals with Pen Register and Trap and Trace Authority under FISA) and [[Detailed breakdown of the USA PATRIOT Act, Title II#Section 215: Access to records and other items under FISA|215]] (expanded what records could be accessed under FISA) should be retained. He argues that the Federal Rules of Criminal Prodecure, Rule 17(c), authorizes the compulsory production of "any books, papers, documents, data, or other objects" to criminal investigators by mere subpoena, and so section 215 merely brought FISA into line with current criminal law. He also states that the records included in section 215 are records held by third parties, and therefore are exempt from a citizen's reasonable expectations of privacy. In light of this, McCarthy believes that there are three main reasons why the access to library records is not a problem: firstly he believes that the government has always had the authority to compel the reading of records by subpoena and there has been "no empirical indication of systematic prying into private choices – else we'd surely have heard from the robustly organized librarians"; secondly he believes that in the current information age that there is just too much information for inappropriate access to such records; and thirdly he believes that an ''a priori'' ban on the investigative access to the reading of records would be both unprecedented and wrong. He points out that "literature evidence was a staple of terrorism prosecutions throughout the 1990s" and that the reading of records has already led to convictions of terrorists.

Though the government must only specify that the records concerned are sought for an authorized investigation instead of providing "specific and articulable facts" to perform surveillance on an agent of a foreign power, he points out that it prohibits investigations that violate first amendment rights of citizens, which he says is not specified in the corresponding criminal procedures. He says that the FISC is not meant to apply searching judicial review of surveillance orders as the role of the judiciary is to make sure the [[executive branch]] is not abusing its powers and "by requiring the FBI to make solemn representations to the court, and mandating that the Attorney General report semi-annually on this provision's implementation, Section 215 provides suitable metrics for oversight and, if necessary, reform". However, McCarthy does believe that section 215 "should be amended to clarify that order recipients may move the FISA court to quash or narrow production", however he says that the US DOJ has already decided that this is implicit in the section so it is probably unnecessary. He believes that further amendment is unnecessary and unwise.

On section 214, McCarthy believes that the pre-Patriot Act version of FISA, which required government agencies to "certify that the monitored communications would likely be those either of an international terrorist or spy involved in a violation of U.S. criminal law, or of an agent of a foreign power involved in terrorism or espionage" was "an unnecessary and imprudently high hurdle" as pen registers and wiretaps do not violate the Fourth Amendment. Therefore, he argues, "there is no constitutional reason to require investigators to seek court authorization for them at all". Thus McCarthy says, the amendments to FISA made by section 214 are "both modest and eminently reasonable".&lt;ref name=ABA_Section214McCarthyStart&gt;[[Andrew C. McCarthy]], [http://apps.americanbar.org/natsecurity/patriotdebates/sections-214-and-215#opening "Why Sections 214 and 215 Should be Retained"] (undated), accessed January 16, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Peter Swire|Peter P. Swire]] was much more skeptical about section 214 and 215 than McCarthy. He explains that FISA originally did not apply to business records and was only designed for surveillance, and after the [[Oklahoma City bombing|Oklahoma]] and [[World Trade Center bombing]] it was amended to apply to travel documents only. It was section 215 that made broad changes to allow access to business records. He also explains that the legal standing changed in such a way that a FISA order to access business records to could apply to anyone, and if necessary the government could ask for access to whole databases. He argues that "FISA orders can now apply to anyone, not only the target of the investigation" and that it is no longer necessary for FISA orders to be targeted against a foreign power or agents of a foreign power, but can now be used to gain records of those who have nothing to do with a foreign power. He says that there are only weak constraints to base the order on an authorized investigation and that surveillance must not be based entirely on First Amendment activities.

Swire pointed out that business records obtained under FISA are different from those obtained under similar criminal legislation, in that gag orders may not be applied to criminal investigations. He also argues that the US DOJ's assertion that they can gain access to documents held by a third party because these documents are not protected by the Fourth Amendment is flawed because "it mistakenly asserts that something that is constitutional is also desirable policy". He points out that "to see this mistake, consider that a 90 percent income tax is almost certainly constitutional, but few people think it therefore would be a wise policy" . In this light he argues that a better policy for sensitive library documents is to have significant oversight from the courts.&lt;ref name="ABA Section 214 and 215 Swire replies"&gt;[[Peter P.

====Section 218====
Andrew C. McCarthy argued that section 218, which changed FISA from stating that the ''purpose'' of foreign surveillance was to gather intelligence information to be the ''significant purpose'' of intelligence information gathering, should be kept even though it is already clear that this is what is meant under FISA in any case. He explains that FISA was misinterpreted to have "primary purpose" tests for surveillance for nearly a quarter-century, and that in April 2002 the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of Review found that,
:''it is quite puzzling that the Justice Department, at some point during the 1980s, began to read the statute as limiting the Department's ability to obtain FISA orders if it intended to prosecute the targeted agents–even for foreign intelligence crimes... the definition of foreign intelligence information includes evidence of crimes such as espionage, sabotage or terrorism. Indeed, it is virtually impossible to read the 1978 FISA to exclude from its purpose the prosecution of foreign intelligence crimes, most importantly because, as we have noted, the definition of an agent of a foreign power–if he or she is a U.S. person–is grounded on criminal conduct.''&lt;ref name=FISCR&gt;''[[Foreign Intelligence Court of Review]]'', [https://fas.org/irp/agency/doj/fisa/fiscr111802.html On Motions for Review of Orders of the United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (Nos. 02–662 and 02-968)]. Argued September 9, 2002; decided November 18, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;
Similarly, McCarthy argues that the separation of foreign intelligence and criminal investigation is a false dichotomy, in that "the existence of a crime or national security threat is an objective reality, entirely independent of the investigators' subjective mindsets about why they are investigating". He believes that it is wrong "to suspect systematically dishonest resort to FISA [, as] FISA applications require a specialized and rigorous internal approval process before presentation to the court. Assuming arguendo an agent willing to act corruptly, it would be far easier and less detectable to fabricate the evidence necessary to get an ordinary criminal wiretap than to fabricate a national security reason to use FISA". McCarthy believes that over time, the U.S. Justice Department misinterpreted FISA to believe that criminal investigations could not be undertaken under FISA, but "began construing the certification not as a mere ''announcement of purpose'' but as something more restrictive: a ''substantive limitation'' on the use of FISA evidence in criminal cases". McCarthy then explains that the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of Review found that ""clearly did not preclude or limit the government's use ... of foreign intelligence information, which included evidence of certain kinds of criminal activity, in a criminal prosecution." McCarthy then notes the practical consequences of the U.S. DoJ's misinterpretation of FISA:
:''The best known pernicious consequence of all this occurred in August 2001. Relying on the wall, FBI headquarters declined to allow criminal investigators to assist an intelligence investigation seeking to locate probable terrorists [[Khalid al-Midhar]] and [[Nawaf al-Hazmi]]. A few weeks later, on 9/11, the pair helped hijack [[Flight 77]] and pilot it into [[the Pentagon]].''
In light of these matters, McCarthy believes that although section 218 is not legally necessary it should remain anyway, to clarify clearly what the Act says and remove any misunderstanding as to what is meant in FISA, and he believes that the section should not sunset.&lt;ref name="ABA Andrew McCarthy Section 218 initial argument"&gt;[[Andrew C. McCarthy]], [http://apps.americanbar.org/natsecurity/patriotdebates/section-218#opening "Why Section 218 Should be Retained"], accessed January 23, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[David D. Cole]] argued that the changes to the law were unnecessary, and accused the proponents of the USA PATRIOT Act of "[being] equally guilty of propagating competing myths in this debate, nowhere more so than with respect to Section 218 and the "wall." He agrees that the wall was not required by FISA, and maintains that section 218 was not sufficient to reduce barriers between information sharing amongst agencies – this, he says, was and remains a bureaucratic issue and not a statutory one. He blames the CIA not trusting the FBI, and believes that pre-Patriot Act FISA was not the cause of problems of communications between the two agencies. Cole's argument is that the primary purpose test applied to acquiring foreign intelligence information when undertaking surveillance was "simply sought to reduce the risk that FISA, which permits searches on less than criminal probable cause, would become an end run around the constitutional requirement of criminal probable cause for searches conducted for criminal law purposes" and that although a secondary criminal purpose may later arise, the agency firstly must primarily gain the order to gain foreign intelligence information. He also dismissed the claims that before section 218 was enacted possible terrorist prosecution was not possible, citing the prosecution of [[Sami Al-Arian]] by the U.S. DOJ, which used FISA wiretaps undertaken before the Patriot Act was enacted, which fell under the pre-Patriot FISA law. He also attacks suggestions that when an investigation turned from foreign intelligence to a primarily criminal investigation then a wiretap would need to be taken down, instead positing that once it became criminal "government agents would simply have to satisfy the standards applicable to criminal investigations – namely, by showing that they had probable cause that the tap would reveal evidence of criminal conduct... [and t]he tap or the search would then continue".

Cole believes that the FISA is based on an untested (by the U.S. Supreme Court) assumption that FISA searches can be performed under a lower showing of suspicion than would be mandated for criminal searches. He believes that the term "foreign power" is broad enough to "[encompass] any political organization {{sic|comprised |hide=y|of}} a majority of non-citizens", and though they must show reasonable evidence of a crime when targeting a U.S. citizen, the agency must only show evidence that a foreign person is an agent of a foreign power. He states that FISA was based on an "administrative search" exception to the Fourth Amendment, which relaxed the probable cause requirement for searches "where the search serves some special need beyond criminal law enforcement". However, Cole believes that the administrative search exception does not apply to criminal law enforcement, therefore when an investigation turns into a primarily criminal investigation the traditional standards of criminal probable cause would then apply. The crux of Cole's argument is that,
:''[b]y abandoning that distinction and allowing searches on less than probable cause where the government is primarily seeking criminal prosecution, Section 218 raises a serious constitutional question. Thus, Section 218 was not only unnecessary to bring down the wall, but may render FISA unconstitutional.''
Cole believes that section 218 makes it more likely "that information obtained through FISA wiretaps and searches will be used against defendants in criminal cases", and suggests that criminal defendants or their cleared counsel should be able to review "the initial application for the FISA wiretap or search when contesting the admissibility of evidence obtained through a FISA search" using "[a]n amendment requiring disclosure of FISA applications where evidence is sought to be used in a criminal trial would encourage adherence to the law by putting federal officials on notice that at some point the legality of the FISA warrant would be subjected to adversarial testing". Confidentiality could be kept by limiting access to the information to cleared council or by applying the restrictions of the [[Classified Information Procedures Act]].&lt;ref name="ABA David Cole Section 218 initial argument"&gt;[[David D. Cole]], [http://apps.americanbar.org/natsecurity/patriotdebates/section-218#rebuttal "Imaginary walls..."], accessed January 23, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

McCarthy totally disagreed with everything Cole said, stating that "It is apt that Professor David Cole begins the title of his response 'Imaginary Walls[.]' His submission is largely imaginary, creating rather than relating 'myths' about the structural impediments to good intelligence that plagued the pre-9/11 world."&lt;!--ouch!--&gt; He believes that Cole's whole argument is pinned to the belief that FISA in unconstitutional, something McCarthy totally disagreed with. In McCarthy's mind, Cole's objection to FISA is that he believes, incorrectly, that under the Fourth Amendment searches are "inappropriate absent probable cause of a crime". He argues that Cole is wrong when he states that FISA requires a lower standard of suspicion to authorize searches, but rather it requires a different standard than is required of criminal searches. McCarthy says Cole's "suggestion that a 'foreign power' under FISA could be any 'political organization' {{sic|comprised |hide=y}} predominantly of non-citizens is overwrought", and that only those organizations proven to be engaged in clandestine operations will be targeted. He also says that Cole is wrong in that under FISA government searches and surveillance were never restricted to searches whose primary purpose was intelligence gathering, and therefore section 218 is not constitutionally suspect. McCarthy says that though the enforcing of a wall between criminal and foreign investigations under FISA was a misunderstanding by the U.S. DOJ, the reality was that the misunderstanding of the Act did not mean that structural restrictions were not established. He ends by stating that "[n]o one claims the wall tainted the propriety of intelligence gathering. It blocked sharing of the intelligence gathered. That is the bureaucratic monstrosity dismantled by Section 218... Without that clarification of law, the disastrous primary purpose doctrine would be undisturbed, the unnecessary wall would still be in place, dots would remain unconnected, prosecutions like al-Arian would not have occurred, and the United States would be at considerably greater risk."&lt;ref name="ABA McCarthy Section 218 response"&gt;[[David D. Cole]], [http://apps.americanbar.org/natsecurity/patriotdebates/section-218#surrebuttal A Response to Professor Cole], accessed January 25, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his final response, Cole defended himself, stating that his argument about the constitutionality of section 218 was because it "deprives FISA of its constitutional justification" — previously, he says, FISA searches were justified without reasonable cause justifications because they fell under an "administrative search" exception in the constitution. However, Cole says that the Supreme Court has held that this "does not apply where the government's purpose is criminal law enforcement". Now that the Patriot Act makes foreign intelligence gathering the significant and not sole reason for FISA searches, allowing for criminal searches under FISA, Cole believes that such searches would then by on constitutionally shaky ground. Cole argues that McCarthy's argument is based on a [[false premise]]: that section 218 is constitutional because, in McCarthy's words, "[it] mandat[es] that intelligence gathering be "a primary purpose," [and] constrains the government in a way that neither the Fourth Amendment nor FISA does". Cole disputes this, and says that "the very purpose of Section 218 was to eliminate the 'primary purpose' requirement". Cole also believes that McCarthy is wrong when he asserts that FISA targets only those "foreign powers" engaged in intelligence gathering, sabotage or international terrorism (McCarthy cited {{usc-clause|50|1801|(b)(2)(A), (C)}}). Cole cites {{usc-clause|50|1801|(a)(5)}}, where FISA defines a "foreign power" as "a foreign-based political organization, not substantially composed of United States persons." and defines an "agent" of a foreign power to be those who are "an officer or employee of a foreign power." This, he says, is too broad, giving the example where a "British citizen working here as an employee of [[Amnesty International]] is an 'agent of a foreign power.'". Cole finally points out that McCarthy does not address his suggestion that "[FISA] should be amended to permit defendants in those prosecutions access to the FISA applications to challenge the warrant's validity".&lt;ref name="ABA David Cole Section 218 end argument"&gt;[[David D.

===Electronic Privacy Information Center===
EPIC has criticized numerous sections of the title. The main thrust of their argument is that the Act does not provide a system of [[checks and balances]] to safeguard civil liberties in the face of significantly increase powers of surveillance and investigative powers for law enforcement agencies in the United States. They criticize:

* Section 203, which gives authorities the ability to share information regarding criminal activity. They specifically believe that the section will not limit disclosure to information relating to investigations of terrorist activities, mainly because the term "foreign intelligence information" is too vague.&lt;ref name=EPIC_ShareInfoSection203&gt;[http://www.epic.org/privacy/terrorism/usapatriot/ Analysis of Specific USA PATRIOT Act Provisions: Expanded Dissemination of Information Obtained in Criminal Investigations], [[Electronic Privacy Information Center]]. Accessed December 5, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Section 206, a section that allows for "roving surveillance" of a target whose actions may have the effect of thwarting the identification of a particular person, is criticized for being too broad in scope and that the privacy of citizens is eroded. They are in particular concerned about those who use the Internet through public facilities such as libraries, university computer labs and [[cybercafe]]s, as the FBI may monitor any facility that the target may be using, and do not have to specify which facility they are monitoring. They believe that this violates the Fourth Amendment, which specifies that search warrants must specify the place being searched.
* Section 213 (the "sneak and peek" section), which allows a court to delay the notification of a search warrant. EPIC claims that delayed notifications were only done in a limited number of cases prior to the Patriot Act and that "[applying] this extraordinary authority to all searches constitutes a radical departure from [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]] standards and could result in routine surreptitious entries by law enforcement agents."&lt;ref name=EPIC_SneakAndPeakSection213&gt;[http://www.epic.org/privacy/terrorism/usapatriot/ Analysis of Specific USA PATRIOT Act Provisions: Authority to Conduct Secret Searches ("Sneak and Peek")], [[Electronic Privacy Information Center]]. Accessed December 5, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Section 214, which deals with pen register and trap and trace authorities, as they believe that the section takes away the "statutory requirement that the government prove the surveillance target is "an agent of a 'foreign power'" and as such "the amendment significantly eviscerates the constitutional rationale for the relatively lax requirements that apply to foreign intelligence surveillance... The removal of the 'foreign power' predicate for pen register/trap and trace surveillance upsets that delicate balance.".
* Section 216, which deals with the authority to issue pen registers and trace devices and contend that "the statutory definitions are vague with respect to the types of information that can be captured and are subject to broad interpretations". They are not impressed with the section's specific exclusion of the contents of such communications, because this is defined in {{usc-clause|18|2510|(8)}} as "[including] any information concerning the substance, purport, or meaning of that communication". They say that it "does not adequately take into account the unique nature of information captured electronically, which contains data far more revealing than phone numbers, such as [[Uniform Resource Locator|URL]]s generated while using the [[World Wide Web|Web]] (which often contain a great deal of information that cannot in any way be analogized to a telephone number)". They also say that "availability of nationwide orders for the interception and collection of electronic evidence would remove an important legal safeguard by making it more difficult for a distant service provider to appear before the issuing court and object to legal or procedural defects".&lt;ref name=EPIC_StatDefVagueSection216&gt;[http://www.epic.org/privacy/terrorism/usapatriot/ Analysis of Specific USA PATRIOT Act Provisions: Pen Registers, the Internet and Carnivore], [[Electronic Privacy Information Center]]. Accessed December 4, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; [[#Nationwide service of search warrants for electronic evidence|Section 220]], which deals with nationwide service of search warrants for electronic evidence, is similarly criticized.
* Section 217, which deals with the interception of computer trespasser communications, has "little, if anything, to do with legitimate investigations of terrorism".
*Section 218, where it is now the "significant purpose" of national security and defense based surveillance to gather foreign intelligence information, they criticized the wording of "Significant" as undefined and vague, and believe that this "could lead to inconsistent determinations and potential overuse of the FISA standards."

EPIC also singled out Section 205, which allows the director of the FBI to employ translators, and [[#Section 208: Designation of judges|section 208]], which increases the number of Federal judges that can review surveillance orders from seven to eleven as "commendable in their efforts to aid the government in preventing terrorist acts while maintaining a system checking intrusion onto citizens' civil liberties".

===American Civil Liberties Union===
The [[ACLU]], an advocate of both free speech and also personal privacy has objected strongly to the Patriot Act, claiming it is flawed and violates a number of personal freedoms. "There are significant flaws in the Patriot Act, flaws that threaten your fundamental freedoms by giving the government the power to access to your medical records, tax records, information about the books you buy or borrow without probable cause, and the power to break into your home and conduct secret searches without telling you for weeks, months, or indefinitely."&lt;ref name="EPIC_ShareInfoSection203"/&gt;

Though the ACLU does not largely name specific sections, generally speaking they:

* Oppose the increased ability of the government to gather records held by a third party about a U.S. citizen's activities (they refer to Section 215). They say that the government has been given too much unchecked power. They believe that the government no longer has to show evidence that the subjects of search orders are an agent of a foreign power, that the FBI does not have to show probable cause to gain access to private information, that [[judicial oversight]] of the new powers given to agencies by the Patriot Act is almost non-existent, that surveillance orders can be based in part on a person's First Amendment activities and that when orders are given they are done ''ex parte'' and ''in camera''.&lt;ref name=ACLUSpecificCriticism&gt;''[[ACLU]]'', [https://www.aclu.org/safefree/general/17326res20030403.html "Surveillance Under the USA PATRIOT Act"], published April 3, 2003; accessed December 31, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Believe the Act unconstitutionally amends the [[Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure]] to allow the government to conduct searches without notifying the subjects, at least until long after the search has been executed (cf. [[#Section 213: Delayed search warrant notification|section 213]])&lt;ref name=ACLUSpecificCriticism/&gt;
* Believe that under the Patriot Act, the FBI can secretly conduct a physical search or wiretap on U.S. citizens to obtain evidence of crime without proving probable cause, as the Fourth Amendment explicitly requires. (cf. [[#Section 216: Authority to issue pen registers and trap and trace devices|section 216]])&lt;ref name=ACLUSpecificCriticism/&gt;
* Oppose the expansion of pen register laws (cf. [[#Section 216: Authority to issue pen registers and trap and trace devices|section 216]]). They believe that the Wiretap Act specifically details the use of pen registers with regards to telephone wiretaps, and was never meant for more modern communication, such as surveillance of websurfing. They oppose roving surveillance (cf [[#Section 206: Roving surveillance authority|section 206]]) and the nationwide authorisation of surveillance (cf. [[#Section 220: Nationwide service of search warrants for electronic evidence|section 220]]) "because a judge cannot meaningfully monitor the extent to which his or her order is being used".&lt;ref name=ACLUSpecificCriticism/&gt;

The EFF has been scathing in its criticism of the Patriot Act. They have stated that "while containing some sections that seem appropriate—providing for victims of the September 11 attacks, increasing translation facilities and increasing forensic cybercrime capabilities—it seems clear that the vast majority of the sections included were not carefully studied by Congress, nor was sufficient time taken to debate it or to hear testimony from experts outside of law enforcement in the fields where it makes major changes" and that "[many provisions] are aimed at nonviolent, domestic crime... [and] although many of the provisions facially appear aimed at terrorism, the Government made no showing that the reasons they failed to detect the planning of the recent attacks or any other terrorist attacks were the civil liberties compromised with the passage of PATRIOT."&lt;ref name=EFFScathing&gt;''[[Electronic Frontier Foundation|EFF]]'', [https://www.eff.org/Privacy/Surveillance/Terrorism/20011031_eff_usa_patriot_analysis.php "EFF analysis of the provisions of the USA PATRIOT Act that relate to online activities"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012032738/http://www.eff.org/Privacy/Surveillance/Terrorism/20011031_eff_usa_patriot_analysis.php |date=October 12, 2007 }}, "Were our Freedoms the Problem?", accessed December 19, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; They have also criticized the addition of computer crimes to the list of acts deemed to be terrorist related.&lt;ref name=EFFComputerCrimeTerrorism&gt;''[[Electronic Frontier Foundation|EFF]]'', [https://www.eff.org/Privacy/Surveillance/Terrorism/20011031_eff_usa_patriot_analysis.php "EFF analysis of the provisions of the USA PATRIOT Act that relate to online activities"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012032738/http://www.eff.org/Privacy/Surveillance/Terrorism/20011031_eff_usa_patriot_analysis.php |date=October 12, 2007 }}, "B.

The EFF have criticized:

* [[#Section 201 &amp; 202:Intercepting communications|Section 201]], in combination with [[USA PATRIOT Act, Title VIII|section 805]] which deals with the material support of terrorism. The EFF believes that U.S. citizens should be allowed to support an organization deemed as terrorist, if only to support them in non-terrorist activities. One example they cite of potential problems with section 805 is that citizens would not have been able to support the [[African National Congress]] (ANC) during apartheid, as they believe they would be classed as a terrorist organization. Further examples are of a humanitarian social worker being unable to train [[Hamas]] members how to care for civilian children orphaned in the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians or a lawyer could not teach [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|IRA]] members about [[international law]], or peace workers offering training in effective peace negotiations or how to petition the United Nations regarding human rights abuses. The EFF, however, does not oppose section 201 on its own and believes that the section that should be repealed is section 805.&lt;ref name=EFF_201_805&gt;''[[Electronic Frontier Foundation|EFF]]'', [https://www.eff.org/patriot/sunset/201.php "Let the Sun Set on PATRIOT – Section 201: 'Authority to Intercept Wire, Oral, and Electronic Communications Relating to Terrorism,' and Section 805, 'Material Support for Terrorism'"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071009191205/http://www.eff.org/patriot/sunset/201.php |date=October 9, 2007 }}, access December 20, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[#Section 201 &amp; 202: Intercepting communications|Section 202]] and [[#Interception of computer trespasser communications|section 217]], which both deal with the approval of intercept orders for the investigation of computer crimes. The EFF believes that this section should sunset because the Congress passed the section without having to "cite even a single instance in which a computer-crime investigation—much less a terrorism investigation—had been hindered due to lack of surveillance authority."&lt;ref name=EFFSection202_217&gt;''[[Electronic Frontier Foundation|EFF]]'', [https://www.eff.org/patriot/sunset/202.php "Let the Sun Set on PATRIOT – Section 202: Section 202, “Authority To Intercept Wire, Oral, And Electronic Communications Relating To Computer Fraud And Abuse Offenses,” and Section 217, “Interception Of Computer Trespasser Communications."], accessed December 22, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[#Section 204: Limitations on communication interceptions|Section 204]], which amended FISA to allow the acquisition of foreign intelligence information from non-U.S. source via a variety of measures, has been criticized as removing safeguards against unchecked surveillance. The EFF has stated that "Congress forgot to clarify that the US could also ignore pen-trap laws when the information is gathered outside the country". They hold that it shows that "204 really clarified was just how bad the rest of the law was even before the USA PATRIOT Act passed, and how government surveillance of international communications is dangerously unregulated", and cite [[ECHELON]] as an example of a system out of control. Section 204 modified {{usc-clause|18|2511|(2)(f)}} to include chapter 206 of the US Code (which deals with the regulation of pen registers and trap and trace devices) and includes electronic devices in the list of devices that agencies can intercept communications. The section in contention states that:
*:''Nothing contained in this chapter or chapter 121 ''[regulations that determines when and where stored communications and transactions can be accessed]'' or 206 of this title, or section 705 of the [[Communications Act of 1934]] ''[disallows anyone who receives, assists with receiving, transmits, or assists in transmitting any interstate or foreign communication by [[wire]] or radio from divulging or publishing the contents of such communications, "except through authorized channels of transmission or reception"]'' shall be deemed to affect the acquisition by the United States Government of foreign intelligence information from international or foreign communications, or foreign intelligence activities conducted in accordance with otherwise applicable Federal law involving a foreign electronic communications system, utilizing a means other than electronic surveillance as defined in section 101 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978, and procedures in this chapter or chapter 121 and the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 shall be the exclusive means by which electronic surveillance, as defined in section 101 of such Act, and the interception of domestic wire, oral, and electronic communications may be conducted.''
:The EFF believe that the Patriot Act should be repealed to fix what they say are abuses in the system. They believe that "strong public opposition to Section 204's expansion of international surveillance authority could send a message to Congress that the rest of the law needs fixing."&lt;ref name=EFF_Section204&gt;''[[Electronic Frontier Foundation|EFF]]'', [https://www.eff.org/patriot/sunset/204.php "Section 204: 'Clarification of Intelligence Exceptions From Limitations on Interception and Disclosure of Wire, Oral, and Electronic Communications.'"], accessed December 28, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[#Section 206: Roving surveillance authority|Section 206]], which allows for the roving surveillance of targets, and allows a government agency to require full assistance to perform such surveillance.

They believe that because there is a lower legal standard for FISA wiretaps it will lead to abuses of the fourth amendment rights of U.S. citizens. The EFF states that "the FBI can wiretap every single phone line, mobile communications device or Internet connection that a suspect might be using, without ever having to identify the suspect by name... for up to a year."&lt;ref name=EFFSection206&gt;''[[Electronic Frontier Foundation|EFF]]'', [https://www.eff.org/patriot/sunset/206.php "Let the Sun Set on PATRIOT – Section 206: 'Roving Surveillance Authority Under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978'"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060605152308/https://www.eff.org/patriot/sunset/206.php |date=June 5, 2006 }}, accessed December 28, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The section in question, 205, amended {{usc-clause|50|1805|(c)(2)(B)}} by inserting 'or in circumstances where the Court finds that the actions of the target of the application may have the effect of thwarting the identification of a specified person, such other persons,' after 'specified person'.

*:''[An order approving an electronic surveillance under this section shall direct] that, upon the request of the applicant, a specified communication or other common carrier, landlord, custodian, or other specified person, or in circumstances where the Court finds that the actions of the target of the application may have the effect of thwarting the identification of a specified person, such other persons, furnish the applicant forthwith all information, facilities, or technical assistance necessary to accomplish the electronic surveillance in such a manner as will protect its secrecy and produce a minimum of interference with the services that such carrier, landlord, custodian, or other person is providing that target of electronic surveillance''
:[[#Section 207: Duration of FISA surveillance on agents of a foreign power|Section 207]] is the section that allows for extensions of up to a year for surveillance of agents of a foreign power (and not U.S. citizens).
* [[#Section 207: Duration of FISA surveillance on agents of a foreign power|Section 207]] extended the duration of surveillance orders against agents of a foreign power from 45 days to 90 days, and physical search orders to up to 120 days, with court extensions for up to a period of one year. The EFF believe that criminal wiretaps were generous enough already, and there was no need to increase the duration of surveillance. They also believe that there is a lower legal standard for probable cause for FISA based surveillance orders and that the section dangerously removes safeguards against the abuse of such orders. However, the extensions to the duration of FISA surveillance orders detailed in section 207 only applies to orders taken out against foreign agents, and not to U.S. citizens. The EFF believes that:
::''PATRIOT 207's extension of the FISA time limits is an unnecessary expansion of power with only one clear "benefit": it reduces the amount of paperwork the FBI has to do in order to maintain continuous surveillance. However, that paperwork is far from busy work—it's a procedural check on government surveillance required by the Constitution.

Now it need only demonstrate "reasonable grounds" for the search to get a court order—or, if it uses a subpoena, mere "relevance" to an investigation.''
*:* ''Before PATRIOT, the FBI eventually had to notify you if it listened to your voice mail messages. Now if they use a search warrant, the only way you'll find out is if the FBI uses your voice mail against you in court.''
*:* ''Before PATRIOT, the FBI could listen to your voice mail only if you were suspected of one of a limited number of serious crimes. Now it can gain access to your voice mail messages for any kind of criminal investigation whatsoever.''
*:* ''Before PATRIOT, if the FBI listened to your voice mail illegally, it couldn't use the messages as evidence against you—this is the so-called exclusionary rule. But the ECPA has no such rule, so even if the FBI gains access to your voice mail in violation of the statute, it can freely use it as evidence against you.''
*:''In stripping these key privacy protections from your voice mail, PATRIOT is in possible violation of the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.''&lt;ref name=EFFSection209&gt;''[[Electronic Frontier Foundation|EFF]]'', [https://www.eff.org/patriot/sunset/209.php "Let the Sun Set on PATRIOT – Section 209: 'Seizure of VoiceMail Messages Pursuant to Warrants'"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929105412/http://www.eff.org/patriot/sunset/209.php |date=September 29, 2007 }}, accessed December 29, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[#Section 212: Emergency disclosure of electronic communications|Section 212]], which allows the emergency disclosure of electronic communications to protect life and limb, because they believe that an ISP or phone company should not be able hand over an individual's private records and messages, without their consent or knowledge, to any law enforcement agent on the belief that there would be immediate danger of death or serious physical injury required it to do so. They further protest section 225 of the [[Homeland Security Act of 2002]] (otherwise known as the [[Cyber Security Enhancement Act of 2002]], which repealed and replaced section 212 of the Patriot Act), as they believe that this expands the Patriot Act's section 212.&lt;ref name=EFFSection212&gt;''[[Electronic Frontier Foundation|EFF]]'', [https://www.eff.org/patriot/sunset/212.php "Let the Sun Set on PATRIOT – Section 212 and Homeland Security Act Section 225: 'Emergency Disclosure of Electronic Communications to Protect Life and Limb'"], accessed December 30, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[#Section 214: Pen register and trap and trace authority|Section 214]], which amended the parts of FISA that deal with pen registers and trap and trace devices, because they believe that originally under FISA, court orders brought before the court were limited to the investigation of foreign threats to national security. They believe that the amendment broadens this to include U.S. citizens and "there's no way for citizens to know how often FISA pen-traps are authorized, whether and to what extent they're being used to spy on Internet communications, or how the court interprets the distinction between communications content and non-content when it comes to Internet communications." They also criticize the amendment for being too vague in specifying what can and can't be trapped (trap and trace and pen registers are only meant to determine data about the nature of communications, not the contents of the communications themselves).&lt;ref name=EFFSection214&gt;''[[Electronic Frontier Foundation|EFF]]'', [https://www.eff.org/patriot/sunset/214.php "Let the Sun Set on PATRIOT – Section 214: 'Pen Register and Trap and Trace Authority Under FISA'"], accessed December 30, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[#Section 215: Access to records and other items under FISA|Section 215]], possibly one of the most controversial sections of the Patriot Act because it expands the ability of a government agency to gain access to records and other items under FISA—though investigations must not be performed on U.S. citizens who are carrying out activities protected by the First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. The EFF believe that it allows the U.S. government to violate the 4th amendment rights of U.S. citizens to privacy, without even having to show probable cause that the records are needed in the investigation. They have stated that:
*:''...under Section 215 the FBI can investigate United States persons (citizens and legal residents) based at least in part on their exercise of First Amendment rights, and can investigate non-U.S. persons based solely on their free speech activities or religious practices. You could be investigated based on the political or religious meetings you attend, the websites you visit or even the books that you read. As a result, Americans may be chilled from exercising these Constitutional rights. Already, attendance at and donations to mosques have dropped significantly, as many Muslims reasonably fear that they will be targeted for investigation based solely on their religious beliefs.''&lt;ref name=EFFSection215_1stAmm&gt;''[[Electronic Frontier Foundation|EFF]]'', [https://www.eff.org/patriot/sunset/215.php "Let the Sun Set on PATRIOT – Section 215: 'Access to Records and Other Items Under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act'"], accessed December 30, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;
:The EFF also objects to the fact that a FISA surveillance order leaves a U.S. citizen with no means to go to court and challenge its legality.&lt;ref name="EFFSection215_1stAmm"/&gt;
* [[#Section 220: Nationwide service of search warrants for electronic evidence|Section 220]], which gives the power to Federal courts to issue nationwide service of search warrants for electronic surveillance. The EFF believe that it should not have been included into the Patriot Act as it deals with criminal cases as well as dealing with terrorism, something they believe that should not have been specified in the Act, "despite the fact that PATRIOT was sold to the American public as a necessary anti-terrorism measure." They believe that agencies will be able to "'shop' for judges that have demonstrated a strong bias toward law enforcement with regard to search warrants, using only those judges least likely to say no—even if the warrant doesn't satisfy the strict requirements of the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution", and that it reduces the likelihood that smaller ISPs or phone companies will try to protect the privacy of their clients by challenging the warrant in court – their reasoning is that "a small San Francisco ISP served with such a warrant is unlikely to have the resources to appear before the New York court that issued it." They believe that this is bad because only the communications provider will be able to challenge the warrant as only they will know about it—many warrants are issued ''ex parte'', which means that the party it is made out against will not need to be present when the order is issued.&lt;ref name=EFFSection220&gt;''[[Electronic Frontier Foundation|EFF]]'', [https://www.eff.org/patriot/sunset/222.php "Let the Sun Set on PATRIOT – Section 220: 'Nationwide Service of Search Warrants for Electronic Evidence'"], accessed December 30, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[#Section 223: Civil liability for certain unauthorized disclosures|Section 223]], which allows for civil liability against those who make unauthorized disclosures of communication. According to the EFF they originally praised this section,&lt;ref name=EFFSection223InitialPraise&gt;''[[Electronic Frontier Foundation|EFF]]'', [https://www.eff.org/patriot/sunset/223.php "Let the Sun Set on PATRIOT – Section 223: 'Civil Liability for Certain Unauthorized Disclosures'"], accessed December 30, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; however they now believe that it is "a legislative trojan horse [and] the few checks and balances that 223 obviously added to the law blinded us to the ones it subtly removed." The EFF's reasoning is as follows:
*:* ''You can no longer sue the government for "intentional" violations of the law, like you can sue everyone else. Instead, the violation has to be "willful," a much higher standard.''
*:*''Before, you could get a trial in front of a jury if you sued the government. Now, suits against the government are heard only by a judge.''
*:*''Unlike with any other defendant, if you want to sue the federal government for illegal wiretapping you have to first go through an administrative procedure with the agency that did the wiretapping. That means, essentially, that you have to politely complain to the illegal wiretappers and tip them off to your legal strategy, and then wait for a while as they decide whether to do anything about it before you can sue them in court.''
*:*''Before PATRIOT, in addition to being able to sue for money damages, you could sue for declaratory relief from a judge. For example, an Internet service provider could ask the court to declare that a particular type of wiretapping that the government wants to do on its network is illegal. One could also sue for an injunction from the court, ordering that any illegal wiretapping stop. PATRIOT section 223 significantly reduced a judge's ability to remedy unlawful surveillance, making it so you can only sue the government for money damages. This means, for example, that no one could sue the government to stop an ongoing illegal wiretap. At best, one could sue for the government to pay damages while the illegal tap continued!''&lt;ref name="EFFSection223InitialPraise"/&gt;
*[[#Section 225: Immunity for compliance with FISA wiretap|Section 225]], which gives legal immunity to those who assist the government in undertaking surveillance that is in accordance with a court order or request for emergency assistance. The EFF believe that with "the lack of any procedure to challenge a FISA order, the never-ending gag order that forever bans you from telling anyone, the secret court that won't listen to your arguments—it's just another incentive for ISPs and phone companies to bend to the demands of the Justice Department or the FISA Court, even when the demand is legally questionable."&lt;ref name=EFFSection225&gt;''[[Electronic Frontier Foundation|EFF]]'', [https://www.eff.org/patriot/sunset/225.php "Let the Sun Set on PATRIOT – Section 225: Immunity for Compliance With FISA Wiretap"], accessed December 30, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

===American Library Association===
The [[American Library Association]] strongly objects to section 215. In a resolution passed on June 29, 2005 they stated that "Section 215 of the USA PATRIOT Act allows the government to secretly request and obtain library records for large numbers of individuals without any reason to believe they are involved in illegal activity". They resolved:

* to urge the Senate, in the FY 2006 Senate Commerce-Justice-State appropriations bill, to bar the use of appropriated funds by the Justice Department to search library and bookstore records under Section 215 of the USA PATRIOT Act;
* to urge the United States Congress to pass legislation that restores the privacy rights of library users;
* to oppose any initiatives on the part of the United States government to constrain the free expression of ideas or to inhibit the use of libraries as represented in the USA PATRIOT Act expansion bill, which they believe to be marked-up in secret by the [[United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence|Senate Select Committee on Intelligence]];
* to urge librarians and other library workers, trustees and advocates throughout the country to continue their efforts to educate their users on the impact of Sections 215 and 505 of the USA PATRIOT Act on libraries.&lt;ref&gt;''[[American Library Association]]'', [http://www.ala.org/Template.cfm?Section=ifresolutions&amp;Template=/ContentManagement/ContentDisplay.cfm&amp;ContentID=101514 Resolution on the USA PATRIOT Act and Libraries], enacted June 29, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Their stance did not go without criticism. One prominent critic of the ALA's stance was the [[Manhattan Institute]]'s [[Heather Mac Donald]], who stated in an article for the ''City Journal'' that "[t]he furor over section 215 is a case study in Patriot Act fear-mongering."&lt;ref&gt;[[Heather Mac Donald]] (Summer 2003), [http://www.city-journal.org/html/13_3_straight_talk.html "Straight Talk on Homeland Security"], ''[[City Journal (New York)|City Journal]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States Government===
In response to its many critics, and in response to the many criticisms of the Patriot Act, the U.S. government set up a website, lifeandliberty.gov, devoted to responding to criticism. This website no longer exists; however, when it did, they devoted a page to what they believed to be myths perpetuated by the ACLU and stated that "Congress simply took existing legal principles and retrofitted them to preserve the lives and liberty of the American people from the challenges posed by a global terrorist network."&lt;ref name="USGovtSharingCrimInvestigation"&gt;''[[United States Government]]'', [http://www.justice.gov/archive/ll/highlights.htm Highlights of the USA PATRIOT Act], accessed January 1, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; They defended:
* [[#Section 203: Authority to share criminal investigative information|Section 203]], which allowed Federal authorities to share information brought before a grand jury. They believe that the ability to share such information allows investigators to "connect the dots". They give the example of how a federal grand jury indicted [[Sami al-Arian]] for allegedly being the U.S. leader of the [[Islamic Jihad Movement in Palestine|Palestinian Islamic Jihad]], which they state to be "one of the world's most violent terrorist outfits"&lt;ref name="USGovtSharingCrimInvestigation"/&gt;
* [[#Section 206: Roving surveillance authority|Section 206]], the roving surveillance authority, stating that it was enacted because "international terrorists are sophisticated and trained to thwart surveillance by rapidly changing locations and communication devices such as cell phones, the Act authorized agents to seek court permission to use the same techniques in national security investigations to track terrorists"&lt;ref name="USGovtSharingCrimInvestigation"/&gt;
* [[#Section 213: Delayed search warrant notification|Section 213]], the ability to delay search warrant notifications. Specifically, they state that "in some cases if criminals are tipped off too early to an investigation, they might flee, destroy evidence, intimidate or kill witnesses, cut off contact with associates, or take other action to evade arrest", and say that they have "been used for decades, have proven crucial in drug and organized crime cases, and have been upheld by courts as fully constitutional."&lt;ref name="USGovtSharingCrimInvestigation"/&gt;
* [[#Section 215: Access to records and other items under FISA|Section 215]], which gave the government increased powers to gain access to records to assist in terrorist investigations. They justify the increased powers because they say that examining business records is a crucial part of investigating terrorist cases and that "law enforcement authorities have always been able to obtain business records in criminal cases through grand jury subpoenas, and continue to do so in national security cases where appropriate." They use the specific example of the 1990 Zodiac gunman [[Heriberto Seda]], where they state that authorities used library records to a Scottish occult poet, and wanted to learn who had checked the poet's books out of the library.&lt;ref name="USGovtSharingCrimInvestigation"/&gt;
* [[#Section 219: Single-jurisdiction search warrants for terrorism|Section 219]], which gives single-jurisdiction of search warrants for terrorism. According to the government "modern terrorism investigations often span a number of districts, and officers therefore had to obtain multiple warrants in multiple jurisdictions, creating unnecessary delays", and they believe that investigations have been streamlined by this section.&lt;ref name="USGovtSharingCrimInvestigation"/&gt;

==Facts==
Charles Potter was an analytical chemist who lived in [[Melbourne]], [[Victoria, Australia|Victoria]] who in 1901 obtained patents in [[New South Wales]] and Victoria for a [[froth flotation]] process using sulphuric acid to separate silver, lead and zinc ores from waste.&lt;ref name="Potter ADB"&gt;{{Australian Dictionary of Biography |first=C.J. |last=Davey |title=Potter, Charles Vincent (1859–1908) |id2=potter-charles-vincent-8084 |accessdate=5 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Broken Hill Proprietary Company, now [[BHP]], was incorporated in Victoria and operated a silver, lead and zinc mine [[Broken Hill]]. [[Guillaume Daniel Delprat|Guillaume Delprat]], the General Manager of BHP, claimed to have discovered a similar process, and this was used at BHP's mine.&lt;ref name="Vic CA"&gt;{{cite AustLII|VicLawRp|93|1905|litigants=Potter v Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd |parallelcite=[1905] [[Victorian Law Reports|VLR]] 612 |courtname=[[Supreme Court of Victoria|Supreme Court (Full Court)]], (Vic Australia)}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Potter commenced proceedings in the [[Supreme Court of Victoria]]. BHP denied the novelty and utility of the patented process, but also that that an action for the infringement in New South Wales of a New South Wales patent was not justiciable in Victoria. The question of law whether the claim was justiciable in Victoria was referred to the Full Court. Potter was represented by [[H.B. Higgins|Higgins]] {{post-nominals|country=AUS|KC}} while BHP was represented by [[Isaac Isaacs|Isaacs]] {{post-nominals|country=AUS|KC}}.&lt;ref&gt;Both Isaacs and Higgins were also members of Parliament, however each maintained a practice as a barrister at the Victorian Bar, until their appointment to the High Court in 1906.&lt;/ref&gt; A majority of the Supreme Court held that the Victorian Courts had no jurisdiction to deal with the suit as the cause of action was local to New South Wales.&lt;ref name="Vic CA"/&gt; Potter appealed to the High Court.

==Judgement==

In a key statement affirming the application of the Moçambique rule, Griffith CJ stated:
&lt;blockquote&gt;It is settled law that an English Court cannot entertain a suit in which the question of title to foreign land is directly in controversy: ''British South Africa Co v Companhia de Moçambique''.&lt;ref name="Mozambique"&gt;''[[British South Africa Co v Companhia de Moçambique]]'' [1893] [[Appeal Cases Law Reports|AC]] 602, [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]], (England and Wales).&lt;/ref&gt; The Courts will no doubt entertain such a question of title if it arises merely incidentally in a case in which the foundation of the jurisdiction is a personal obligation arising from contract or quasi-contractual relationship between the parties.&lt;ref name="HCA"/&gt;{{rp|at pp. 498–499}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He further went on to say:
&lt;blockquote&gt;In my opinion the same rule must be applied to foreign patents that is applied to foreign lands. The reasons upon which the rule in the one case are founded are, I think, equally applicable to the other.&lt;ref name="HCA"/&gt;{{rp|at p. 499}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'As already mentioned, the decision is generally regarded as based on the Moçambique rule. Although the Moçambique rule is one of the elements in the conclusion of the High Court, an examination of the way in which the case was argued, and of the reasoning of the High Court, shows that it is a decision extending the act of state doctrine to foreign patents.'&lt;ref name=Lucasfilm/&gt;{{rp|at [60]}}

==Judicial consideration==

===Australia===
In 2002 a majority of the High Court indicated that it would like to reconsider this authority, with [[Murray Gleeson|Gleeson]] [[Chief Justice of Australia|CJ]], [[Mary Gaudron|Gaudron]], [[Michael McHugh (judge)|McHugh]], [[William Gummow|Gummow]] and [[Kenneth Hayne|Hayne]] [[Justices|JJ]] stating "We also would reserve for further consideration in an appropriate case the Moçambique rule,&lt;ref&gt;After ''British South Africa Co v Companhia de Moçambique'' [1893] [[Appeal Cases Law Reports|AC]] 602.&lt;/ref&gt; and the standing of ''Potter v Broken Hill Propriety Co Ltd''."&lt;ref name="HCA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Regie"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|10|2002|litigants=Regie Nationale des Usines Renault SA v Zhang |parallelcite=(2002) 210 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 491 |pinpoint=[76] |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The matter arose again in the High Court in 2011 where [[Robert French|French]] CJ, Gummow, Hayne, [[Susan Crennan|Crennan]], [[Susan Kiefel|Kiefel]] and [[Virginia Bell|Bell]] JJ noted that ''Potter v Broken Hill Propriety Co Ltd'' &lt;blockquote&gt;was argued on a basis which, though conceded, can now be seen to be false, namely,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|88|1906|litigants=Potter v Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd |parallelcite=[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1906/88.pdf (1906)&amp;nbsp;3&amp;nbsp;CLR&amp;nbsp;479]}} at 510; see also at 489, 491, 495, 502-503, 505-507.&lt;/ref&gt; 'that, for the purposes of the question ... under  consideration, the several States of Australia stand towards each other in the position of foreign States'. No consideration appears to have been given in argument or in the judgments to relevant constitutional questions including, but not limited to, the application of the full faith and credit provisions of [[Section 118 of the Constitution of Australia|s 118 of the Constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|50|2011|litigants=Moti v The Queen |parallelcite= (2011) 245 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 456 |date=7 December 2011 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

{{As of|2017|6}} the High Court has not reconsidered the standing of ''Potter v Broken Hill Propriety Co Ltd''.&lt;ref name="law cite"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=1906%20HCA%2088&amp;sort-order=court |accessdate=5 June 2017 |title=Potter v Broken Hill Propriety Co Ltd |website=LawCite search}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
'It received no attention in the English case-law until it was mentioned by Lord Wilberforce in ''Hesperides Hotels Ltd v Aegean Turkish Holidays Ltd'' [1979] [[Appeal Cases Law Reports|AC]] 508, 536 as authority for the proposition that the ''Moçambique'' rule applied in Australia. It was only from the 1980s that it came to be regarded as a significant authority in the field of transnational intellectual property litigation: ''Def Lepp Music v Stuart-Brown'' [1986] {{abbr|RPC|Reports of Patent, Design and Trade Mark. Cases (UK)}} 273; ''Tyburn Productions Ltd v Conan Doyle'' [1991] [[Chancery Division|Ch]] 75 (both copyright cases).'&lt;ref name=Lucasfilm/&gt;{{rp|at [68]}}

The 2011 [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom|United Kingdom Supreme Court]] decision of ''[[Lucasfilm Limited v Ainsworth]]'',&lt;ref name=Lucasfilm/&gt; significantly eroded much of the underpinning of this case and of the [[Mozambique rule|''Moçambique'' rule]], at least within the UK.&lt;ref name=Lucasfilm/&gt;{{rp|at [105]}}

==Notes==
This case was decided at a time when patents were granted by the several States in Australia, and was subject to the common law rule that each Australian State and Territory is treated as a 'distinct and separate country or law area'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|4|1958|litigants=Laurie v Carroll |parallelcite=(1958) 98 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 310 at p. 331 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Prussian estates''' ({{lang-de|Preußischer Landtag}}, {{lang-pl|Stany pruskie}}) were representative bodies of [[Prussia (region)|Prussia]], first created by the [[Monastic state of the Teutonic Knights|Monastic state of Teutonic Prussia]] in the 14th century (around the 1370s)&lt;ref name=ds&gt;Daniel Stone, ''A History of Central Europe'', University of Washington Press, 2001, {{ISBN|0-295-98093-1}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=LFgB_l4SdHAC&amp;pg=PA18&amp;dq=%22Prussian+estates%22&amp;sig=ACfU3U09S0rqg4o3WUuk2R7I7mhTAFW_cg Google Print, p.18-19]&lt;/ref&gt; but later becoming a [[Devolution|devolved]] [[legislature]] for [[Royal Prussia]] within the [[Kingdom of Poland (1385–1569)|Kingdom of Poland]]. They were at first composed of officials of six big cities of the region; [[Braniewo|Braunsberg (Braniewo)]], [[Chełmno|Culm (Chełmno)]], [[Elbląg|Elbing (Elbląg)]], [[Gdańsk|Danzig (Gdańsk)]], [[Königsberg|Königsberg (Królewiec)]] and [[Toruń|Thorn (Toruń)]].&lt;ref name=ds/&gt; Later, representatives of other towns as well as [[nobility]] were also included.&lt;ref name=ds/&gt;&lt;ref name=kf21-24&gt;Karin Friedrich, ''The Other Prussia: Royal Prussia, Poland and Liberty, 1569-1772'', Cambridge University Press, 2006, {{ISBN|0-521-02775-6}}, [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=kpulHjDt8UEC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR11&amp;dq=%22Prussian+estates%22&amp;ots=zDDwX-j_Jb&amp;sig=dS04WCP9crfZjgIE4ppI0iEcgFQ#PPA21,M1 Google Print, pp. 21–24]&lt;/ref&gt; The estates met on average four times per year, and discussed issues such as [[commerce]] and [[Foreign policy|foreign relations]].&lt;ref name=ds/&gt;&lt;ref name=kf21-24/&gt;

== Era of Teutonic Prussia ==
Originally, the [[Teutonic Knights|Teutonic Order]] created the Estate to appease the local citizens, but over time the relations between the Order and the Estates grew strained, as the Order of [[knight]]s treated the local population with contempt.&lt;ref name=ds/&gt;&lt;ref name=nh/&gt;

Different Prussian holders of the [[Right of coinage|privilege of coinage]] (among them the Order and some cities), actually committed to issue a Prussian currency of standardised quality, had [[Debasement|debased]] the coins and expanded their circulation in order to finance the wars between Poland and Teutonic Prussia. However, this expansion disturbed the equilibrium of coins circulated to the volume of contractual obligations, only coming down to a harsh depreciation of all existing nominally fixed contractual obligations by [[Inflation|inflating]] all other non-fixed prices measured by these coins, ending only once the [[purchasing power]] of every extra issued coin equalled its material and production costs.&lt;ref&gt;Nicolaus Copernicus, ''Modus cudendi monetam'' (1519) [= Way of Coinage; i.e. the Latin title of Copernicus' own translation into German of his 'N.(icolai) C.(oppernici&lt;!--sic! 2 "p"s--&gt;), Meditata XV Augusti anno domini MDXVII, 1517], published in: Erich Sommerfeld (ed.), ''Die Geldlehre des Nicolaus Copernicus: Texte, Übersetzungen, Kommentare; in memoriam Kurt Braunreuther 1913–1975'', Berlin: Akademie-Verlag, 1978, pp. 33–37, lines 26–31 of Copernicus' original text, as given by Sommerfeld.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Ulf Heinsohn, "The Role of Good Bills and Covered Bonds in the Creation of Money", in: ''Eigentum und Recht und Freiheit: Otto Steiger zum Gedenken'' ([[Gedenkschrift]]), Detlev Ehrig and Uwe Staroske (eds.), Marburg: Metropolis, 2010, pp. 213–233, here pp. 216seq. {{ISBN|978-3-89518-775-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Obligations would be retroactively changed if new coins, too plentifully issued, would be counted as equal to the old ones (1526, lines 307-310&lt;ref&gt;Nicolaus Copernicus, ''[[Monetae cudendae ratio|Monete cudende ratio per Nicolaum Coppernicum]]'' (1526), Erich Sommerfeld (trl.), published in: Erich Sommerfeld (ed.), ''Die Geldlehre des Nicolaus Copernicus: Texte, Übersetzungen, Kommentare; in memoriam Kurt Braunreuther 1913–1975'', Berlin: Akademie-Verlag, 1978, pp. 48–67, lines 307–310 of Copernicus' original text, as given by Sommerfeld.&lt;/ref&gt;)."&lt;ref&gt;Ulf Heinsohn, "The Role of Good Bills and Covered Bonds in the Creation of Money", in: ''Eigentum und Recht und Freiheit: Otto Steiger zum Gedenken'' ([[Gedenkschrift]]), Detlev Ehrig and Uwe Staroske (eds.), Marburg: Metropolis, 2010, pp. 213–233, here p. 218. {{ISBN|978-3-89518-775-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus a law was "passed by the Diet of Teutonic Prussia in 1418 (cf. Max Toeppen, 1878, 320seqq.&lt;ref&gt;„Disse nachgeschrieben verramung diss gantzen landes ist ausgangen von Marienburg am sontage nach Allerheiligen tag Anno 1418“, in: ''Acten der Ständetage Preussens unter der Herrschaft des Deutschen Ordens'', Max Pollux Toeppen (ed.), see [[#References|references for more detailed]] bibliographical information, vol. 1: Die Jahre 1233–1435, pp. 320seqq.&lt;/ref&gt;), smartly regulating the fulfilment of old debts fixed in old currency by adding an agio when repaid by new coins."&lt;ref&gt;Ulf Heinsohn, "The Role of Good Bills and Covered Bonds in the Creation of Money", in: ''Eigentum und Recht und Freiheit: Otto Steiger zum Gedenken'' ([[Gedenkschrift]]), Detlev Ehrig and Uwe Staroske (eds.), Marburg: Metropolis, 2010, pp. 213–233, here footnote 78 on p. 218. {{ISBN|978-3-89518-775-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Nicolaus Copernicus, ''Monete cudende ratio per Nicolaum Coppernicum'' (1526), Erich Sommerfeld (trl.), published in: Erich Sommerfeld (ed.), ''Die Geldlehre des Nicolaus Copernicus: Texte, Übersetzungen, Kommentare; in memoriam Kurt Braunreuther 1913-1975'', Berlin: Akademie-Verlag, 1978, pp. 48–67, lines 331–334 of Copernicus' original text, as given by Sommerfeld.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus creditors and recipients of nominally fixed revenues were not to lose by debasement-induced inflation.

As Prussia became increasingly tied economically and politically with Poland, and the wars became more and more devastating to the borderlands, and as the policies and attitude of the [[King of Poland]] were more liberal towards the Prussian [[:wikt:burgher|burgher]]s and nobility than that of the Order, the rift between the Teutonic Knights and their subjects widened.

The Estates drifted towards the [[Kingdom of Poland (1385–1569)|Kingdom of Poland]] in their political alignment.&lt;ref name=ds/&gt;&lt;ref name=kf21-24/&gt; Norman Housley noted that "The alienation of the Prussian Estates represented a massive political failure on the part of the Order".&lt;ref name=nh&gt;Norman Housley, ''The Later Crusades, 1274-1580: From Lyons to Alcazar'', Oxford University Press, 1992, {{ISBN|0-19-822136-3}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=JQP2F2q9xDkC&amp;pg=PA369&amp;dq=%22Prussian+estates%22+failure&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;sig=ACfU3U3UVeccihxLTRm0zlw6Lsw35toE6w Google Print, p. 339]&lt;/ref&gt;

At first, the estates opposed the Order passively, by denying requests for additional taxes and support in [[Polish-Teutonic wars|Order wars with Poland]]; by the 1440s Prussian estates acted openly in defiance of the Teutonic Order, rebelling against the knights and siding with Poland militarily (see [[Lizard Union (medieval)|Lizard Union]], [[Prussian Confederation]] and the [[Thirteen Years' War (1454–66)|Thirteen Years' War]]).&lt;ref name=ds/&gt;&lt;ref name=kf21-24/&gt;

== Era of Ducal and Royal Prussia within Poland and Poland-Lithuania ==
The estates eventually became governed by the Kingdom of Poland. First the western part of Prussia, which became known as [[Royal Prussia]] after the [[Second Peace of Thorn]] ended the Thirteen Years' War in 1466, and later the eastern lands, known as [[Ducal Prussia]], after the [[Prussian Homage]] in 1525, became part of the kingdom.&lt;ref name=kf21-24/&gt;&lt;ref name=nh/&gt;&lt;ref name=hh&gt;Hajo Holborn, ''A History of Modern Germany: 1648-1840'', Princeton University Press, 1982, {{ISBN|0-691-00796-9}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=yeXYMV3CZ0IC&amp;pg=PA58&amp;vq=Prussian+estates&amp;dq=%22Prussian+estates%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;source=gbs_search_s&amp;sig=ACfU3U3gEc_KDJFTf8dpMnps84ZxNLdlHQ Google Print, p.58]&lt;/ref&gt; On 10 December 1525 at their session in Königsberg the Prussian estates established the [[Lutheran]] Church in Ducal Prussia by deciding the [[Church Order (Lutheran)|Church Order]].&lt;ref name="Juška 1997 2-Reformatorische Anfänge"&gt;Albertas Juška, ''Mažosios Lietuvos Bažnyčia XVI-XX amžiuje'', Klaipėda: 1997, pp. 742–771, here after the German translation [http://www.liuteronai.lt/Istorija-ir-teologija/Baznycios-istorija/Die-Kirche-in-Klein-Litauen ''Die Kirche in Klein Litauen''] (section: 2. Reformatorische Anfänge; {{de-icon}}) on: [http://www.liuteronai.lt/eng ''Lietuvos Evangelikų Liuteronų Bažnyčia''], retrieved on 28 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nicolaus Copernicus]], then [[canon (priest)|canon]] of the [[Prince-Bishopric of Warmia]], addressed the Prussian estates with three memoranda, in fact little essays,&lt;ref&gt;In these essays Copernicus also described, what has been later called [[Gresham's law]] by [[Henry Dunning Macleod]].&lt;/ref&gt; on currency reform.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Erich Sommerfeld (ed.), ''Die Geldlehre des Nicolaus Copernicus: Texte, Übersetzungen, Kommentare; in memoriam Kurt Braunreuther 1913–1975'', Berlin: Akademie-Verlag, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt; Debasements continued to ruin Prussian finances, the [[groat (coin)|groat]] had been debased by 1/5 to 1/6 of its prior [[bullion]] content. In 1517, 1519 and again in 1526 he suggested to return to the law passed in 1418.&lt;ref&gt;Nicolaus Copernicus, ''Monete cudende ratio per Nicolaum Coppernicum'' (1526), Erich Sommerfeld (trl.), published in: Erich Sommerfeld (ed.), ''Die Geldlehre des Nicolaus Copernicus: Texte, Übersetzungen, Kommentare; in memoriam Kurt Braunreuther 1913–1975'', Berlin: Akademie-Verlag, 1978, pp. 48–67, lines 307–310 and 331–334 of Copernicus' original text, as given by Sommerfeld.&lt;/ref&gt; However, especially the cities refused that. They had raised most of the funds for the warfares, and now lightened their debt burden by debasing their coins, thus passing on part of the burden to receivers of nominally fixed revenues, such as civic and ecclesiastical creditors and civic, feudal and ecclesiastical collectors of nominally fixed monetarised dues. So Copernicus' effort failed. At least the estates refused to peg the Prussian currency to the Polish (as proposed by [[Justus Ludwik Decjusz|Ludwig Dietz]]), which even suffered a worse debasement than the Prussian.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Nicolaus Copernicus, "Epistola Consiliariorum Prussie ad Ludouicum Decium Cracouiensem de Ratione restituende monete Pruthenice" (Letter of the councillors of Prussia to Ludwig Dietz from Cracow, concerning the improvement of the Prussian coin) (1526), published in: Erich Sommerfeld (trl.), ''Die Geldlehre des Nicolaus Copernicus: Texte, Übersetzungen, Kommentare; in memoriam Kurt Braunreuther 1913–1975'', Berlin: Akademie-Verlag, 1978, pp. 112–123, lines 13-15 of the Latin original as given by Sommerfeld on p. 112 (with German translation on p. 113).&lt;/ref&gt;

Under Polish sovereignty, Prussians, particularly those from Royal Prussia, saw their liberties confirmed and expanded; local cities prospered economically ([[Gdańsk]] become the largest and richest city in the Commonwealth), and local nobility participated in the benefits of [[Golden Liberty]], such as the [[Royal elections in Poland|right to elect the king]].&lt;ref name=kf21-24/&gt; Royal Prussia, as a direct part of the Kingdom of Poland (and later [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]]) had more influence on Polish politics and more privileges than Ducal Prussia, which remained a [[fief]] (for example, while nobles from the Royal Prussia had their own [[sejmik]]s, [[sejm walny|Sejm]] and [[Senate of Poland|Senate]] representatives, those from the Duchy did not. Royal Prussia also had its own parliament, the [[Prussian]] ''[[legislature|Landesrat]]'', although it was partially incorporated into the Commonwealth Sejm after the [[Union of Lublin]], it retained distinct features of Royal Prussia.&lt;ref&gt;Karin Friedrich, ''The Other Prussia: Royal Prussia, Poland and Liberty, 1569–1772'', Cambridge University Press, 2006, {{ISBN|0-521-02775-6}}, [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=kpulHjDt8UEC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR11&amp;dq=%22Prussian+estates%22&amp;ots=zDDwX-j_Jb&amp;sig=dS04WCP9crfZjgIE4ppI0iEcgFQ#PPA31,M1 Google Print, p.31]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Era of the Kingdom of Prussia ==
With the power of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth waning from the mid-17th century onwards, the Prussian Estates drifted under the influence of the [[Hohenzollern]] [[Electors of Brandenburg]], who ruled Ducal Prussia in personal union with Brandenburg from 1618 (first the eastern [[Duchy of Prussia]], sovereign after the [[Treaty of Wehlau]] in 1657 and upgraded to the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] in 1701; then the western Royal Prussia, annexed to the former after the [[First Partition of Poland]] in 1772). Under the Hohenzollerns' [[Absolute monarchy|absolutist rule]] the power of the Estates increasingly diminished.&lt;ref name=hh/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;F. L.

[[File:Siegelmarke Westpreussische General - Landschaftsdirection W0205325.jpg|thumb|Sealing stamp of the Westpreussische Landschaft]] The West and East Prussian Estates, separately (the latter gathering after 1772 representatives of newly formed [[East Prussia]], comprising the former Duchy of Prussia and the parts of former Royal Prussia west of the [[Vistula]]), again played a role in the transformation from feudal traditional agriculture to agricultural business. The [[Silesian Wars]] of 1740-1763 had required high taxes, such that many Prussian tax-payers went into debt. Feudal manor estates were not free property sellable at the will of their holders or – in case of over-indebtedness – by way of execution prompted by the creditors of the holders. So the holders of feudal manor estates found it difficult to borrow against their estates. Therefore, in 1787 the [[West Prussia]]n estates, and a year later the East Prussian estates, each took on the task of forming credit corporations: the Westpreussische Landschaft and the {{ill|Ostpreussische Landschaft|de|Ostpreußische Landschaft}}, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Diederich Ernst Bühring, a merchant from Berlin, initiated this process by adopting the idea from [[Dutch Indochina]] and persuading [[Frederick II of Prussia|Frederick II]] to introduce such a system, starting with a credit corporation of the manor estate holders in war-ridden Prussian [[History of Silesia|Silesia]] in 1769. Cf. Claus Schrempf, ''Pfandbriefe und Kommunalobligationen als Geldanlage'', Munich: Moderne Industrie, 1958, p. 10. No ISBN&lt;/ref&gt;

Members of the Estates, then by status mostly noble landed manor holders, and the circle of potential debtors were literally the same. In order to overcome the restrictions on selling manor estates to fulfil outstanding debts, the manor estate holders formed a corporation of mutually liable debtors. So solvent manor estate holders had to step in for over-indebted borrowers, thus transforming the manor estate holders into a corporation of collective liability. Covering over-indebted borrowers imposed hardship for the solvent manor-estate holders. This affected many opinions and even aroused appeals to abolish the feudal system of manor estate holding, while others demanded the re-establishment of pure feudalism without borrowing at all.

In the [[Napoleonic era]] (ca 1799-1815) the East Prussian Estates gained some political influence again. King [[Frederick William III of Prussia]] needed to raise funds in order to pay the enormous French war contributions of [[Prussian thaler|thaler]] 140 million imposed after Prussia's defeat of 1806, and making up about an annual pre-war budget of the government.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Brandt in collaboration with Thomas Hofmann, ''Preußen: Zur Sozialgeschichte eines Staates''; eine Darstellung in Quellen, edited on behalf of Berliner Festspiele as catalogue to the exhibition on Prussia between 15 May and 15 November 1981, Reinbek bei Hamburg: Rowohlt, 1981, (=Preußen; vol. 3), p. 80. {{ISBN|3-499-34003-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1807 the East Prussian Estates made a political bargain on accepting the king as a member within their credit corporation with his royal East Prussian [[demesne]]s, to be encumbered as security for the [[Pfandbrief]]e to be issued in his favour, which he was to sell to investors, thus raising credit funds.

In return the Estates reached a wider representation of further parts of the population. The reformed body included two new groups:

* the East Prussian free peasants, called {{ill|Kölmer|de}} (holders of free estates according to [[Culm law]]) and forming a considerable group only in former Teutonic Prussia holding about a sixth of the arable East Prussian land, and
* non-noble holders of manor estates, who had meanwhile acquired 10% of the feudal land mostly by eventual, but complicated and – subject to government authorisation – purchases of manor estates from over-indebted noble landlords.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Brandt in collaboration with Thomas Hofmann, ''Preußen: Zur Sozialgeschichte eines Staates''; eine Darstellung in Quellen, edited on behalf of Berliner Festspiele as catalogue to the exhibition on Prussia between 15 May and 15 November 1981, Reinbek bei Hamburg: Rowohlt, 1981, (=Preußen; vol. 3), pp. 24 and 35. {{ISBN|3-499-34003-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With representation in the estates the newly represented groups were also entitled to eventually raise credits, obliged to liability for credits of others, but simultaneously gained a say in the Estates assembly.

On 9 October 1807 the [[Prussian reforms|reforming]] Prussian minister [[Heinrich Friedrich Karl vom und zum Stein|Heinrich vom und zum Stein]] prompted Frederick William III to decree the [[October Edict]] (Edict concerning the relieved possession and the free usage of real estate [landed property] as well as the personal relations of the rural population) which generally transformed all kind of landholdings into free [[allodial]] property.&lt;ref name="Brandt Hofmann 82"&gt;Peter Brandt in collaboration with Thomas Hofmann, ''Preußen: Zur Sozialgeschichte eines Staates''; eine Darstellung in Quellen, edited on behalf of Berliner Festspiele as catalogue to the exhibition on Prussia between 15 May and 15 November 1981, Reinbek bei Hamburg: Rowohlt, 1981, (=Preußen; vol. 3), p. 82. {{ISBN|3-499-34003-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; This act enormously increased the amount of alienable real estate in Prussia apt to be pledged as security for credits, needed so much to pay the higher taxes in order to finance Napoléon's warfare through the compulsory war contributions to France. [[Serfdom]] was thus also abolished.&lt;ref&gt;The 1.9 million farmers, who were personally free, but whose land was subject to [[soccage]], and the 2.5 million liberated serfs, now free peasants, had to redeem the former dues and [[soccage]] by a payment in instalments to their former lords organised as of 1811 and mostly fulfilled until 1850, with a few cases lasting into the early 20th century. Cf. Peter Brandt in collaboration with Thomas Hofmann, ''Preußen: Zur Sozialgeschichte eines Staates''; eine Darstellung in Quellen, edited on behalf of Berliner Festspiele as catalogue to the exhibition on Prussia between 15 May and 15 November 1981, Reinbek bei Hamburg: Rowohlt, 1981, (=Preußen; vol. 3), p. 103. {{ISBN|3-499-34003-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most remaining legal differences between the estates (classes) were abolished in 1810, when almost all Prussian subjects – former feudal lords, [[serf]]s, [[:wikt:burgher|burgher]]s (city dwellers), free peasants, [[Huguenot]]s etc., turned into citizens of Prussia. The last excepted group - the Jews - became citizens in 1812.&lt;ref name="Brandt Hofmann 82"/&gt;

When in 1813 the defeated and intimidated King Frederick William III, forced into a coalition with France from 1812,&lt;ref name="Pflug 1863 44"&gt;Ferdinand Pflug, [[s:Aus den Zeiten der schweren Noth (8)|"Aus den Zeiten der schweren Noth.

On 23 January Count [[Friedrich Ferdinand Alexander zu Dohna-Schlobitten]], president of the Estates assembly, called its members for 5 February 1813.&lt;ref name="Pflug 1863 55"&gt;Ferdinand Pflug, [[s:Aus den Zeiten der schweren Noth (8)|"Aus den Zeiten der schweren Noth.

After debating the appeal of [[Ludwig Yorck von Wartenburg|Ludwig Yorck]], illoyal and – therefore by Berlin – outlawed general of the Prussian auxiliary corps within Napoléon's army, to form a liberation army, which was widely agreed,&lt;ref name="Pflug 1863 55"/&gt; on February 7 the East Prussian estates unanimously voted for financing, recruiting and equipping a militia army (Landwehr) of 20,000 men, plus 10,000 in reserve, out of their funds - following a proposal designed by Yorck, [[Clausewitz]] and Stein. The hesitant king could not stop this anymore, but only approve it (17 March 1813).&lt;ref name="Pflug 1863 44"/&gt;

However, this civic act of initiating Prussia's participation in the [[War of the Sixth Coalition|liberation wars]] did not meet with the gratitude of the monarch, who again and again procrastinated over his promise to introduce a parliament of genuine legislative competence for all the monarchy. Only in the wake of the [[Revolutions of 1848]] did Prussia receive its first constitution providing for the [[Preußischer Landtag|Prussian Landtag]] as the parliament of the kingdom. It consisted of two chambers, the Herrenhaus ([[Prussian House of Lords]]) and the Abgeordnetenhaus (House of Representatives).

In 1899, the Prussian Landtag moved into a new building consisting of a complex of two structures, one for the House of Lords ({{as of | 2015 | lc = on}} used by the [[Bundesrat of Germany|Bundesrat]]) in [[Leipziger Straße]] and one for the House of Representatives in Prinz-Albrecht-Straße, today's [[Niederkirchnerstraße]].

The House of Lords was reorganised and renamed into the [[Prussian State Council|Staatsrat]] (state council) of the [[Free State of Prussia]] after the abolition of the monarchy in 1918. Its members were representatives of the [[Provinces of Prussia]]. [[Konrad Adenauer]] served as its [[List of Presidents of the State Council of Prussia|president]] from 1921 to 1933.

Since 1993 the former House of Representatives building has served as the seat of the [[Abgeordnetenhaus von Berlin]] (House of Representatives of Berlin), and similar to the Reichstag, among Berliners it is still sometimes referred to [[colloquially]] as ''Preußischer Landtag''.

'''''R v Secretary of State for Home Affairs ex parte O'Brien''''' [1923] 2 KB 361 was a 1923 [[test case (law)|test case]] in [[English law]] that sought to have the internment and deportation of Irish nationalist sympathisers earlier that year declared legally invalid. In March 1923 between 80 and 100 suspected Irish nationalists in Britain were arrested by the police and sent to the [[Irish Free State]] under the [[Restoration of Order in Ireland Act 1920]] (ROIA). One of the detainees, [[Art O'Brien]], challenged his detention in a test case at the [[Divisional Court]]. The case eventually went to both the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]] and [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]], who decided that the internments were illegal because the Irish Free State was an independent nation and so British Acts of Parliament no longer applied to it.

The decision effectively illegalised the ROIA and led to the immediate release of O'Brien and the other detained individuals, who sued the British Government for false imprisonment. The government pushed through the [[Restoration of Order in Ireland (Indemnity) Act 1923]], which limited the money they had to pay the detainees, who eventually received £43,000. O'Brien himself was re-arrested and found guilty of [[sedition]], and was imprisoned until 1924.

==Background==
Following the [[Irish War of Independence]] the [[Irish Free State]] was set up as an independent British [[Dominion]] covering most of the [[Ireland|island of Ireland]]. After a brief [[Irish Civil War|civil war]] between the pro-Free State forces and members of the [[Irish Republican Army (1922–1969)|Irish Republican Army]] (IRA) who wanted any independent nation to cover the entire island the status of the Irish Free State was confirmed, and the IRA forced underground.&lt;ref name="h36"&gt;Hyde (1960) p.123&lt;/ref&gt; The IRA had supporters in the United Kingdom, working openly as the [[Irish Self-Determination League]] (ISDL), and the Free State government shared the names of these supporters with the British authorities, who kept a close eye on them.&lt;ref name="h36"/&gt; Between February and March they provided information on individuals that they said were part of widespread plots against the Irish Free State being prepared on British soil.&lt;ref&gt;Chandler (1924) p.273&lt;/ref&gt; On 11 March 1923 the police in Britain arrested IRA sympathisers living in Britain including Art O'Brien, the head of the ISDL.&lt;ref name="h37"&gt;Hyde (1960) p.124&lt;/ref&gt; Sources disagree on numbers, giving either approximately eighty&lt;ref name=am1&gt;Amato (2002) p.32&lt;/ref&gt; or approximately 100.&lt;ref name="h37"/&gt; The arrested men were placed on special trains and sent to Liverpool, where they were transferred to Dublin via a [[Royal Navy]] destroyer.&lt;ref name=am1/&gt; It later transpired that not only were many British citizens (Art O'Brien himself had been born in England),&lt;ref name=chand1&gt;Chandler (1924) p.274&lt;/ref&gt; at least six had never even been to Ireland before.&lt;ref name="h37"/&gt;

The next day the arrests were publicly queried in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]], and a Labour backbencher [[Jack Jones (Silvertown MP)|Jack Jones]] started a debate on the subject in the afternoon. [[William Bridgeman, 1st Viscount Bridgeman|W.C. Bridgeman]], the [[Home Secretary]], said that he had directly ordered the police to arrest the ISDL members under the [[Restoration of Order in Ireland Act 1920]], and that he had consulted the [[Attorney General for England and Wales|Attorney General]] who considered it legal.&lt;ref name="h37"/&gt;

==Divisional Court==
A few days after the arrests the solicitors for one of the deported men, Art O'Brien, got in contact with [[Patrick Hastings|Sir Patrick Hastings]] [[King's Counsel|KC]], a [[Member of Parliament (UK)|Member of Parliament]] for the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] and a noted [[barrister]].&lt;ref name="h38"&gt;Hyde (1960) p.126&lt;/ref&gt; On 23 March 1923 Hastings represented O'Brien in front of a [[Divisional Court]] consisting of [[Horace Avory|Mr Justice Avory]] and [[Arthur Salter (judge)|Mr Justice Salter]] to apply for a writ of ''[[habeas corpus]]'' for O'Brien as a test case to allow the release of the others. The initial hearing did not go anywhere because Hastings was unable to provide an affidavit from O'Brien (who was in [[Mountjoy Prison]]),&lt;ref name=chand1/&gt; which was required for a writ of ''habeas corpus'' to be considered, but by the time the hearing was resumed on 10 April he had managed to obtain one.&lt;ref name="h38"/&gt; Hastings argued that because the Irish Free State was an independent nation the British laws governing it, such as the 1920 act, were effectively repealed.&lt;ref name="h39"&gt;Hyde (1960) p.127&lt;/ref&gt; In addition the [[Home Secretary]] had no power to order an individual to be detained overseas because he had no control over what happened to them there.&lt;ref name="h39"/&gt;

The court eventually declared that they could not issue a writ, because the [[Habeas Corpus Act 1862]] prevented them from issuing a writ to any colony possessing a court which could also issue a writ. Since Ireland possessed such a court, the English Divisional Court could not act.&lt;ref name="h39"/&gt; Hastings attempted to argue that the writ could be issued against the Home Secretary but this also failed, since the Home Secretary did not actually possess O'Brien.&lt;ref name="h40"&gt;Hyde (1960) p.128&lt;/ref&gt;

==Court of Appeal and House of Lords==
The decision was then appealed to the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]] and argued on 23 and 24 April.&lt;ref name="h40"/&gt; The Court of Appeal reversed the [[Divisional Court]]'s decision.&lt;ref&gt;Bonner (2007) p.80&lt;/ref&gt; The court decided that the [[Restoration of Order in Ireland Act 1920]] had been implicitly repealed when the [[Irish Free State]], an independent nation, came into existence. In addition it was not proper for the Home Secretary to order the detention and deportation of someone overseas, since they had no control over what happened to them.&lt;ref name=img1&gt;Amato (2002) p.33&lt;/ref&gt; It was completely appropriate to issue a writ of ''[[habeas corpus]]'' against the Home Secretary because, even though he did not physically have O'Brien, he was considered responsible for him.&lt;ref name="h40"/&gt; The Home Secretary was accordingly ordered to produce O'Brien before the court on 16 May.&lt;ref name="h41"&gt;Hyde (1960) p.129&lt;/ref&gt;

He appealed to the [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]], who decided (led by [[F. E. Smith, 1st Earl of Birkenhead|Lord Birkenhead]]) that they did not have the jurisdiction to hear the appeal,&lt;ref name="h41"/&gt; since a rule of English law specifies that once a writ of ''habeas corpus'' is issued (as it was by the Court of Appeal) no superior court can overrule it.&lt;ref&gt;Chandler (1924) p.276&lt;/ref&gt; After a further attempt to keep O'Brien in custody (simply by not letting him out of prison)&lt;ref name=am1/&gt; he was finally released on 16 May.&lt;ref name="h41"/&gt;

==Aftermath==
O'Brien immediately sued the British Government for false imprisonment, and to avoid any liability the government prepared the [[Restoration of Order in Ireland (Indemnity) Act 1923]] which would indemnify them against any claims for damages by the imprisoned sympathisers.&lt;ref name=img1/&gt; The [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] whittled it down when it was being prepared so that it would only limit compensation rather than remove it entirely.&lt;ref name="h41"/&gt; A tribunal was set up under [[James Atkin, Baron Atkin|Lord Atkin]] to assess damages, and the sympathisers as a whole were eventually paid £43,000.&lt;ref name=img1/&gt; Art O'Brien himself was arrested soon after release and convicted of [[sedition]].&lt;ref&gt;Bonner (2007) p.81&lt;/ref&gt; He was released in 1924.&lt;ref name=img1/&gt;

'''Reasonable doubt''' is a term used in [[jurisdiction]] of [[common law]] countries. Evidence that is beyond reasonable doubt is the [[Legal burden of proof|standard of evidence]] required to validate a criminal conviction in most [[adversarial system|adversarial legal systems]].&lt;ref&gt;Grechenig, Nicklisch &amp; Thoeni, Punishment Despite Reasonable Doubt - A Public Goods Experiment with Sanctions under Uncertainty, Journal of Empirical Legal Studies (JELS) 2010, vol. 7 (4), p. 847-867 [http://ssrn.com/abstract=1733792 (ssrn).]&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally, prosecutors bear the [[Legal burden of proof|burden of proof]] and are required to prove their version of events to this standard. This means that the proposition being presented by the prosecution must be proven to the extent that there could be no "reasonable doubt" in the mind of a "[[reasonable person]]" that the defendant is guilty. There can still be a doubt, but only to the extent that it would ''not'' affect a reasonable person's belief regarding whether or not the defendant is guilty.  Beyond "the shadow of a doubt" is sometimes used interchangeably with beyond reasonable doubt, but this extends beyond the latter, to the extent that it may be considered an impossible standard. The term "reasonable doubt" is therefore used.

If doubt ''does'' affect a "reasonable person's" belief that the defendant is guilty, the jury is not satisfied beyond "reasonable doubt".  The precise meaning of words such as "reasonable" and "doubt" are usually defined within [[jurisprudence]] of the applicable country.  A related idea is [[Blackstone's formulation]] "It is better that ten guilty persons escape than that one innocent suffer".

Beyond a reasonable doubt is the highest burden of proof in any court in the United States. Criminal cases must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt.

==By jurisdiction==

===United Kingdom===
====England and Wales====
In English common law prior to the "reasonable doubt" standard, passing judgment in criminal trials had severe religious repercussions for jurors.  According to judicial law prior to the 1780s: "the Juryman who finds any other person guilty, is liable to the Vengeance of God upon his Family and Trade, Body and Soul, in this world and that to come."&lt;ref name="What Are the Origins"&gt;James Q. Whitman [http://hnn.us/articles/47018.html ''What Are the Origins of Reasonable Doubt?''], History News Network, George Mason University, February 25, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; It was also believed "In every case of doubt, where one's salvation is in peril, one must always take the safer way....A judge who is in doubt must refuse to judge."&lt;ref name="What Are the Origins"/&gt;  It was in reaction to these "religious fears"&lt;ref name="What Are the Origins"/&gt; that "reasonable doubt" was introduced in the late 18th century to English common law, thereby allowing jurors to more easily convict.  Therefore, the original use of the "reasonable doubt" standard was opposite to its modern use of limiting a juror's ability to convict.

However, juries in criminal courts in England are no longer customarily directed to consider whether there is "reasonable doubt" about a defendant's guilt.  Indeed, a 2008 conviction was appealed after the judge had said to the jury "You must be satisfied of guilt beyond all reasonable doubt." The conviction was upheld but the [[Appeal Court]] made clear their unhappiness with the judge's remark, indicating that the judge should instead have said to the jury simply that before they can return a verdict of guilty, they "must be sure that the defendant is guilty".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Crim/2009/2563.html R v Majid] [2009] EWCA Crim 2563 (12 October 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

The principle of 'beyond reasonable doubt' was expounded in ''Woolmington v DPP [1935] UKHL 1'':&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1935/1.html Woolmington v DPP] [1935] UKHL 1 (23 May 1935)''&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Juries are always told that, if conviction there is to be, the prosecution must prove the case beyond reasonable doubt. This statement cannot mean that in order to be acquitted the prisoner must "satisfy" the jury. This is the law as laid down in the Court of Criminal Appeal in Rex v. Davies 29 Times LR 350; 8 Cr App R 211, the headnote of which correctly states that where intent is an ingredient of a crime there is no onus on the defendant to prove that the act alleged was accidental. '''Throughout the web of the English Criminal Law one golden thread is always to be seen, that it is the duty of the prosecution to prove the prisoner's guilt''' subject to what I have already said as to the defence of insanity and subject also to any statutory exception. If, at the end of and on the whole of the case, there is a reasonable doubt, created by the evidence given by either the prosecution or the prisoner, as to whether the prisoner killed the deceased with a malicious intention, the prosecution has not made out the case and the prisoner is entitled to an acquittal. No matter what the charge or where the trial, the principle that the prosecution must prove the guilt of the prisoner is part of the common law of England and no attempt to whittle it down can be entertained.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Canada===
In Canada, the expression "beyond a reasonable doubt" requires clarification for the benefit of the jury.&lt;ref name=Brydon&gt;{{Cite court

  |url=http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/1997/1997canlii319/1997canlii319.html
 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The leading decision is ''[[R. v. Lifchus]]'',&lt;ref name=Lifchus/&gt; where the Supreme Court discussed the proper elements of a [[jury instructions|charge to the jury]] on the concept of "reasonable doubt" and noted that "[t]he correct explanation of the requisite burden of proof is essential to ensure a fair criminal trial." While the Court did not prescribe any specific wording that a trial judge must use to explain the concept, it recommended certain elements that should be included in a jury charge, as well as pointing out comments that should be avoided.

The Supreme Court suggested that the concept of proof beyond a reasonable doubt should be explained to juries as follows:&lt;ref name=Lifchus/&gt;
* The standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt is inextricably intertwined with that principle fundamental to all criminal trials, the [[presumption of innocence]].
* The burden of proof rests on the prosecution throughout the trial and never shifts to the accused.
* A reasonable doubt is not a doubt based upon sympathy or prejudice, and instead, is based on reason and common sense.
* Reasonable doubt is logically connected to the evidence or absence of evidence.
* Proof beyond a reasonable doubt does not involve proof to an absolute certainty. It is not proof beyond any doubt, nor is it an imaginary or frivolous doubt. 
* More is required than proof that the accused is probably guilty. A jury which concludes only that the accused is probably guilty must acquit.

The Court also warned trial judges that they should avoid explaining the concept in the following ways:&lt;ref name=Lifchus/&gt; 
* By describing the term "reasonable doubt" as an ordinary expression which has no special meaning in the criminal law context.
* By inviting jurors to apply to the task before them the same standard of proof that they apply to important, or even the most important, decisions in their own lives.
* By equating proof "beyond a reasonable doubt" to proof "to a moral certainty".
* By qualifying the word "doubt" with adjectives other than "reasonable", such as "serious",  "substantial", or "haunting", which may mislead the jury.
* By instructing jurors that they may convict if they are "sure" that the accused is guilty, before providing them with a proper definition as to the meaning of the words "beyond a reasonable doubt".

The Supreme Court of Canada has since emphasized in ''[[R. v. Starr]]''&lt;ref name=Starr&gt;{{Cite court

===New Zealand===
In New Zealand, jurors are typically told throughout a trial that the offence must be proved "beyond reasonable doubt", and judges usually include this in the summing-up.&lt;ref name=Juries1999/&gt; There is no absolute prescription as to how judges should explain reasonable doubt to juries. Judges usually tell jurors that they will be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt if they "feel sure" or "are sure" that the defendant is guilty.&lt;ref name=CrimLR665/&gt; In line with appellate court direction, judges do little to elaborate on this or to explain what it means.&lt;ref name=Juries1999&gt;{{cite book |last1=Young |first1=Warren |last2=Cameron |first2=Neil |author3=Tinsley, Yvette |title=Juries in Criminal Trials: Part Two |url=http://www.lawcom.govt.nz/sites/default/files/publications/1999/11/Publication_76_159_PP37Vol2.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=14 April 2012 |series=Preliminary Paper 37 |volume=2 |date=November 1999 |publisher=Law Commission |location=Wellington, New Zealand |isbn=1-877187-42-9 |page=54 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130209183448/http://www.lawcom.govt.nz/sites/default/files/publications/1999/11/Publication_76_159_PP37Vol2.pdf |archivedate=9 February 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CrimLR665&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Young |first1=William |authorlink1=William Young (judge) |year=2003 |title=Summing-up to juries in criminal cases – what jury research says about current rules and practice |journal=Crim LR |volume=665 |pages=674 |url=http://www.canberra.edu.au/ncf/events/williamyoung.pdf |accessdate=14 April 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121103091947/http://www.canberra.edu.au/ncf/events/williamyoung.pdf |archivedate=3 November 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research published in 1999 found that many jurors were uncertain what "beyond reasonable doubt" meant. "They generally thought in terms of percentages, and debated and disagreed with each other about the percentage certainty required for 'beyond reasonable doubt', variously interpreting it as 100 per cent, 95 per cent, 75 per cent and even 50 per cent. Occasionally this produced profound misunderstandings about the standard of proof."&lt;ref name=Juries1999/&gt;

In ''[[R v Wanhalla]]'', President [[William Young (judge)|Young]] of the Court of Appeal set out a model jury direction on the standard of proof required for a criminal conviction.

In the United States, juries must be [[jury instructions|instructed]] to apply the reasonable doubt standard when determining the guilt or innocence of a criminal defendant, but there is much disagreement as to whether the jury should be given a definition of "reasonable doubt."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Reasonable doubt: to define, or not to define |first=H. A. |last=Diamond |journal=[[Columbia Law Review]] |year=1990 |volume=90 |issue=6 |pages=1716–1736 |doi=10.2307/1122751 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Victor v. Nebraska]]'' (1994), the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] expressed disapproval of the unclear reasonable doubt instructions at issue, but stopped short of setting forth an exemplary jury instruction.&lt;ref&gt;Victor v. Nebraska, {{ussc|511|1|1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. Supreme Court first discusses the term in ''[[Miles v. United States]]'' (1880): "The evidence upon which a jury is justified in returning a verdict of guilty must be sufficient to produce a conviction of guilt, to the exclusion of all reasonable doubt."  ''[[In re Winship]]'' (1970) establishes that the doctrine also applies to juvenile criminal proceedings, and indeed to all the essential facts necessary to prove the crime:  "[W]e explicitly hold that the Due Process Clause protects the accused against conviction except upon proof beyond a reasonable doubt of every fact necessary to constitute the crime with which he is charged."

===Japan===
Since 1945, Japan has also operated by a "reasonable doubt" standard, including the doctrine of ''[[in dubio pro reo]]'', which was instituted by the Supreme Court during a controversial murder trial in 1975 (the Shiratori case brought before the Supreme Court of Japan, see for example notes on [[Shigemitsu Dandō]]). However, this is not considered an essential standard in Japan and lower level judges sometimes disregard it.&lt;ref name="Goodman2003"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Goodman|first1=Carl F|title=Rule of Law in Japan : A Comparative Analysis - What You See May Not Be What You Get|date=2003|publisher=Kluwer Law International|isbn=9789041189035|page=253&lt;!--|accessdate=1 September 2016--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Sabath Act''' was a Federal law that established an immigrant protection network.

==Provisions==

It was sponsored by Rep. [[Adolph J. Sabath]] (D) of Illinois. The act (passed in July, 1913) established Federal Bureaus at railroad junctures and stations to protect [[immigrant]]s from local [[Nativism (politics)|nativists]] and to aid newly arrived immigrants to the United States who were traveling cross-country to their final destinations. The government rented buildings near the stations and equipped them with reception rooms, baths, laundry, and beds.  After the [[Immigration Act of 1924|immigration restriction]]s of the early 1920s, Congress failed to appropriate any further funds for the act and, while still on the books, it fell into disuse.

Brawley's family has maintained that the allegations were true.

== Origins of the case ==

On November 28, 1987, Tawana Brawley, who had been missing for four days from her home in [[Wappingers Falls, New York|Wappingers Falls]], [[New York (state)|New York]], was found seemingly unconscious and unresponsive, lying in a garbage bag several feet from an apartment where she had once lived. Her clothing was torn and burned, her body smeared with feces. She was taken to the emergency room, where the words "[[Ku Klux Klan|KKK]]", "nigger", and "bitch" were discovered written on her torso with charcoal.&lt;ref name="GJ report"/&gt;

A detective from the Sheriff's Juvenile Aid Bureau, among others, was summoned to interview Brawley, but she remained unresponsive. The family requested a black officer, which the police department was able to provide. Brawley, described as having an "extremely spacey" look on her face, communicated with this officer with nods of the head, shrugs of the shoulder, and written notes. The interview lasted 20 minutes, during which she uttered only one word: "neon". Through gestures and writing, however, she indicated she had been raped repeatedly in a wooded area by six white men, at least one of whom, she said, was a police officer. A [[sexual assault kit]] was administered, and police began building a case. Brawley provided no names or descriptions of her assailants. She later told others that there had been no rape, only other kinds of sexual abuse. Forensic tests found no evidence that a sexual assault of any kind had occurred. There was no evidence of exposure to elements, which would have been expected in a victim held for several days in the woods at a time when the temperature dropped below freezing at night.&lt;ref name=NYTPuzzle&gt;{{cite news| url= https://www.nytimes.com/1988/02/29/nyregion/brawley-case-stubborn-puzzle-silent-victim.html?src=pm&amp;pagewanted=7&amp;pagewanted=all |title= Brawley Case: Stubborn Puzzle, Silent Victim| date= February 29, 1988 | work= The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public response==
[[File:Al Sharpton January 2015.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Al Sharpton]] (''pictured in 2015'') helped handle Brawley's publicity.]]
Public response to Brawley's story was at first mostly sympathetic. [[Bill Cosby]] offered a $25,000 reward for information on the case, while [[Don King (boxing promoter)|Don King]] pledged $100,000 toward Brawley's education.&lt;ref name=cosby&gt;{{cite web |url=https://nypost.com/2013/08/04/pay-up-time-for-brawley-87-rape-hoaxer-finally-shells-out-for-slander/|title=Pay-up time for Brawley: '87 rape-hoaxer finally shells out for slander |first=Michael |last=Gartland |date=August 4, 2013 |work=New York Post |accessdate=August 11, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1987, over one thousand people, including [[Nation of Islam]] leader [[Louis Farrakhan]], marched through the streets of [[Newburgh, New York]], in support of Brawley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A tense relationship.|url=http://www.recordonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20061101/NEWS/611010341|quote=Some witnesses say they saw Brawley in Newburgh during the time she was missing, but that never was proven.

Brawley's claims in the case captured headlines across the country. Public rallies were held denouncing the incident. When civil rights activist [[Al Sharpton]], with attorneys [[Alton H. Maddox]] and [[C. Vernon Mason]], began handling Brawley's publicity, the case quickly became highly controversial.&lt;ref name=Book/&gt; Sharpton, Maddox, and Mason generated a national media sensation. The three said that officials all the way up to the state government were trying to cover up defendants in the case because they were white.&lt;ref name=s/&gt; They further asserted that the Ku Klux Klan, the [[Irish Republican Army]] and the [[American Mafia|Mafia]] were collaborating with the U.S. government in the alleged cover up.&lt;ref name=kkk/&gt; Harry Crist Jr., a police officer who committed suicide shortly after the period when Brawley was allegedly held captive, became a suspect in the case. Steven Pagones, an Assistant [[District attorney|District Attorney]] in [[Dutchess County, New York]], attempted to establish an alibi for Crist, stating that he had been with Crist during that period of time. Sharpton, Maddox, and Mason then said that Crist and Pagones were two of the rapists. They also accused Pagones of being a racist.&lt;ref name=s&gt;{{cite news|author=Sleeper, Jim|date=February 24, 2000|title=Playing politics with death|url=http://www.salon.com/2000/02/24/diallo_2/|work=[[Salon (website)|Salon]]|accessdate=December 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Bruni, Frank|date=March 15, 1998|title=Finally, His Day in Court; Man Wrongly Accused in Brawley Case Will Be Heard|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/03/15/nyregion/finally-his-day-in-court-man-wrongly-accused-in-brawley-case-will-be-heard.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=May 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported, based on his [[suicide note]], that Crist killed himself because his girlfriend ended their relationship shortly before his death, and because he was upset that he was unable to become a [[State police (United States)|state trooper]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Bruni, Frank|date=April 5, 1998|title=Mourning a Son Tied to the Brawley Case|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/04/05/nyregion/mourning-a-son-tied-to-the-brawley-case.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=May 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[mainstream media]]'s coverage drew heated criticism from the African-American press and leaders for its treatment of the teenager.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Markovitz|first1=Jonathan|title=Legacies of lynching : racial violence and memory|date=2004|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|location=Minneapolis|isbn=978-0-8166-3995-3| page= 92}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Friedman|first1=Ellen G.|title=Morality USA| date= 1998| publisher=Univ. of Minnesota Press|location=Minneapolis|isbn=9780816627493|page=69|quote=For segments of the black press, however, the Brawley story's truth was not in question: the case simply demonstrated the bankruptcy of the white justice system.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1= McFadden|first1=Robert D.|title=Outrage : the story behind the Tawana Brawley hoax|date=1990|publisher=Bantam|location=New York|isbn=9780553057560}}&lt;/ref&gt; They cited the leaking and publication of photos taken of her at the hospital and the revelation of her name despite her being underage.&lt;ref name=underage&gt;{{cite news| first=Utrice |last= Leid| authorlink= Utrice Leid| title= It's an outrage! |work= [[The City Sun]]| date= April 26 – May 2, 1989| quote= The same media that demanded Brawley "prove" her sexual assault made no such demands in the Central Park case. The same media that had no difficulty identifying the underaged Wappingers Falls teenager by name, invading the sanctity of her home to show her face and even televising semi-nude pictures of her while she was in the hospital...}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, critics were concerned that Brawley had been left in the custody of her mother, stepfather and advisers, rather than being given protection by the state. In an opinion piece in ''The New York Times'', Martha Miles and Richard L. Madden wrote&lt;ref name=miles&gt;{{cite news| first1= Martha| last1= Miles| first2=Richard L. |last2=Madden|title=After the Grand Jury; What Happened to Tawana Brawley's Case – And to Attitudes About Race and Justice|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DEFD71339F93AA35753C1A96E948260| work=The New York Times |date=October 9, 1988|accessdate=April 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;State law provides that if a child appears to have been sexually molested, then the Child Protective Services Agency is supposed to take jurisdiction and custody of that child. Now, Tawana Brawley was 15 at the time of the incident. If that had been done... early on, the agency would have given her psychiatric attention and preserved evidence of rape...&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Sharpton's former aide Perry McKinnon said that Sharpton, Maddox, and Mason were unconcerned with Brawley and were using the case to "tak[e] over the town," as he had heard Sharpton say that the case could make him and Brawley's other two advisers "the biggest niggers in New York".&lt;ref name=kkk&gt;{{cite news|author=Blumenthal, Ralph|date=1998|title= Abrams Considers a Possible Hoax In Brawley Case|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/06/16/nyregion/abrams-considers-a-possible-hoax-in-brawley-case.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=May 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1988, at the height of the controversy surrounding the case, a poll showed a gap of 34 percentage points between blacks (51%) and whites (85%) on the question of whether Brawley was lying.&lt;ref name=Book&gt;{{cite book| first1= Robert Charles |last1= Smith| first2= Richard |last2= Seltzer| title= Contemporary Controversies and the American Racial Divide| publisher= Rowman &amp; Littlefield| year=2000}}&lt;!-- ISBN, page(s) needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Grand jury hearings==
Under the authority of New York State [[Attorney general|Attorney General]] [[Robert Abrams]], a [[grand jury]] was called to hear evidence. On October 6, 1988, the grand jury released its 170-page report concluding Brawley had not been abducted, assaulted, raped and [[Sodomy|sodomized]], as Brawley and her advisers said. The report further concluded that the "unsworn public allegations against Dutchess County Assistant District Attorney Steven Pagones" were false and had no basis in fact. Before issuing the report, the grand jury heard from 180 witnesses, saw 250 exhibits and recorded more than 6,000 pages of testimony.&lt;ref name="Pagones vs. Maddox" /&gt;

In the decision, the grand jury noted many problems with Brawley's story. Among these were that the rape kit results did not indicate sexual assault. Additionally, despite saying she been held captive outdoors for days, Brawley was not suffering from hypothermia, was well-nourished, and appeared to have brushed her teeth recently. Despite her clothing being charred, there were no burns on her body. Although a shoe she was wearing was cut through, Brawley had no injuries to her foot. The racial epithets written on her were upside down, which led to suspicion that Brawley had written the words. Testimony from her schoolmates indicated she had attended a local party during the time of her supposed abduction. One witness claimed to have observed Brawley's climbing into the garbage bag.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Man says Brawley seemed to be faking. |first=Michael |last=Hill| publisher=''[[Albany Times Union]]''| date=January 13, 1998 | page=B2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The feces on her body were identified as coming from her neighbor's dog.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Michael|last= Gartland| title= 25 years after her rape claims sparked a firestorm, Tawana Brawley avoids the spotlight. |url=https://nypost.com/2012/12/23/25-years-after-her-rape-claims-sparked-a-firestorm-tawana-brawley-avoids-the-spotlight/|work= [[New York Post]] |date=December 23, 2012|accessdate=January 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Brawley never testified despite a subpoena ordering her to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= William|last= Glaberson|work= The New York Times| title= Once Again, Brawley Declines to Testify | url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A03E6D61239F937A15754C0A96E958260|date=July 24, 1998 |accessdate=March 30, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1988-08-16/news/8801230237_1_subpoena-brawley-tawana-brawley-brawley-family|title=GRAND JURY DECIDES TO SUBPOENA BRAWLEY|first=New York Times News|last=Service|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 6, 1988, Tawana's mother Glenda Brawley was sentenced to 30 days in prison and fined $250 for contempt of court for refusing to testify at the grand jury hearing. She evaded arrest by hiding in churches, with the police failing to arrest her, arguing it would lead to violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/07/22/nyregion/disputes-stalling-police-agencies-in-plans-to-arrest-glenda-brawley.html|title=Disputes Stalling Police Agencies In Plans to Arrest Glenda Brawley|first=Jeffrey|last=Schmalz|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Brawley family then fled New York state, travelling around the country for several months before settling in [[Virginia Beach]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/09/21/nyregion/the-brawley-family-moves-to-virginia-beach.html|title=The Brawley Family Moves to Virginia Beach|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Possible motives===
Much of the grand jury evidence pointed to a possible motive for Brawley's falsifying the incident: trying to avoid violent punishment from her mother and her stepfather, Ralph King. Witnesses testified that Glenda Brawley had previously beaten her daughter for running away and for spending nights with boys. King had a history of violence that included stabbing his first wife 14 times, later shooting and killing her. There was considerable evidence that King could and would violently attack Brawley: when Brawley had been arrested on a [[shoplifting]] charge the previous May, King attempted to beat her for the offense while at the police station. Witnesses also described King as having talked about his stepdaughter in a sexualizing manner.&lt;ref name="Evidence Points"&gt;{{cite news |title= Evidence Points to Deceit by Brawley |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE0D81E3FF934A1575AC0A96E948260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=September 27, 1988 |accessdate=January 20, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the day of her alleged disappearance, Brawley had skipped school to visit her boyfriend, Todd Buxton, who was serving a six-month jail sentence. When Buxton's mother (with whom she had visited Buxton in jail) urged her to get home before she got in trouble, Brawley told her, "I'm already in trouble." She described how angry King was over a previous incident of her staying out late.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Brawley Case: Stubborn Puzzle, Silent Victim |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DEFD91038F93AA15751C0A96E948260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all |work= The New York Times |date=February 29, 1988 |quote=She vanished on a cold, moonless autumn night in Wappingers Falls, N.Y., from a strip of gas stations and fast-food outlets that stand as a kind of neon-lit mockery of [[Washington Irving]]'s quaint old haunts up the Hudson. |accessdate=January 20, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was evidence that Brawley's mother and King participated knowingly in the hoax. Neighbors told the grand jury that in February they overheard Glenda Brawley saying to King, "You shouldn't have took the money because after it all comes out, they're going to find out the truth." Another neighbor heard Mrs. Brawley say, "They know we're lying and they're going to find out and come and get us."&lt;ref name="Evidence Points" /&gt;

In April 1989, ''[[New York Newsday]]'' published claims by a boyfriend of Brawley's, Daryl Rodriguez, that she had told him the story was fabricated, with help from her mother, in order to avert the wrath of her stepfather.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |title=Paper Says Brawley Friend Was Told of Faked Assault. |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DEFDA123EF93BA15757C0A96F948260 |work=The New York Times |date=April 28, 1989 |accessdate=April 22, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing about the case in a 2004 book on perceptions of racial violence, sociologist Jonathan Markovitz concluded "it is reasonable to suggest that Brawley's fear and the kinds of suffering that she must have gone through must have been truly staggering if they were enough to force her to resort to cutting her hair, covering herself in feces and crawling into a garbage bag."&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

==Aftermath==
[[File:Patricia Williams by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Patricia J. Williams]]' comments regarding the case were controversial.]]
The case highlighted mistrust of legal institutions within the black community.&lt;ref name=miles/&gt; Legal scholar [[Patricia J. Williams]] wrote in 1991 that the teenager "has been the victim of some unspeakable crime. No matter how she got there. No matter who did it to her—and even if she did it to herself."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first= Patricia J. |last= Williams| authorlink= Patricia J.

Indifference to the distinction between fact and fiction minimizes real suffering by implying that it is no worse than imagined or self-inflicted suffering."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first1= Daniel A. |last1= Farber| first2= Sue | last2= Sherry| title= Beyond All Reason: The Radical Assault on Truth in American Law| publisher= Oxford University Press| year=1997| page=96}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 21, 1990, Alton H. Maddox was indefinitely suspended by the Appellate Division of the State Supreme Court in Brooklyn after failing to appear before a disciplinary hearing to answer allegations regarding his conduct in the Brawley case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Court suspends Maddox for refusal to testify at grievance hearing. | first=Arnold| last=Lubasch | url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE0D91F3DF931A15756C0A966958260 |date=May 22, 1990| work=The New York Times | page=B1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, Pagones was awarded $345,000 through a lawsuit for defamation of character that he had brought against Sharpton, Maddox and Mason; Pagones initially sought $395 million. The jury found Sharpton liable for making seven defamatory statements about Pagones, Maddox for two and Mason for one. The jury deadlocked on four of the 22 statements over which Pagones had sued, and it found eight statements to be non-defamatory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |title=Winner in Brawley suit says victory is bittersweet. |url=http://www.cnn.com/US/9807/13/brawley.verdict.02 |publisher=[[CNN]] | location= Poughkeepsie, New York| agency= Reuters, Associated Press| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20020811233652/http://www.cnn.com/US/9807/13/brawley.verdict.02/ |accessdate=June 21, 2007 |archivedate=August 11, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a later interview, Pagones said the turmoil caused by the accusations of Brawley and her advisers had cost him his first marriage and much personal grief.&lt;ref&gt;Sverdlik, Alan.

The '''Treaty of Brussels''', also referred to as the '''Brussels Pact''', was the founding treaty of the [[Western Union (alliance)|Western Union]] (WU) between 1948 and 1954, at which it point it was amended as the '''Modified Brussels Treaty''' ('''MTB''') and served as the founding treaty of the [[Western European Union]] (WEU) until its termination in 2010. The treaty provided for the organisation of military, economic, social and cultural cooperation among member states, as well as a mutual defence clause.

The treaty was signed on 17 March 1948 by [[Belgium]], [[France]], [[Luxembourg]], the [[Netherlands]] and the [[United Kingdom]] - the members of the Western Union - as an expansion to the [[Treaty of Dunkirk]], signed between Britain and France the previous year to guard against possible German or Soviet aggression after the end of [[World War II]].

The need to back up the commitments of the [[North Atlantic Treaty]] with appropriate political and military structures led to the creation of the [[NATO|North Atlantic Treaty Organisation]] (NATO). In December 1950 the parties to the Treaty of Brussels decided to transfer the headquarters, personnel, and plans of the [[Western Union]] Military Organisation (WUDO) to NATO, whose [[Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe]] (SHAPE) took over responsibility for the defence of Western Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/1957/feb/18/brussels-treaty-organisation-resolution Hansard extract] February 18, 1957&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ElusiveQuest&gt;{{cite book |title= The elusive quest for European security: from EDC to CFSP |last= Duke |first= Simon |year= 2000 |publisher= [[Palgrave Macmillan]] |location= Basingstoke, UK |isbn= 978-0-312-22402-8 |pages= 13–14 |url= http://us.macmillan.com/theelusivequestforeuropeansecurity |accessdate=2010-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DYK&gt;{{cite web | title= Did you know that Europe already had a defensive military alliance prior to NATO? | url= http://www.aco.nato.int/page20923100.aspx | work= [[Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe|Allied Command Operations (ACO)]] | publisher= [[NATO]] | year= 2010 | accessdate=2010-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kaplan&gt;{{cite book |title= NATO 1948: the birth of the transatlantic Alliance |last= Kaplan |first= Lawrence S. |year= |publisher= [[Rowman &amp; Littlefield|Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers, Inc.]] |location= [[Lanham, Maryland]] |isbn= 0-7425-3917-2 |pages= 139–165 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=UV-ti1sYcbcC&amp;pg=PA139&amp;lpg=PA139&amp;dq=%http://www.rowmanlittlefield.com/Catalog/SingleBook.shtml?command=Search&amp;db=^DB/CATALOG.db&amp;eqSKUdata=0742539172 |accessdate=2010-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= Brussels Treaty Organisation (Resolution) |url= http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/1957/feb/18/brussels-treaty-organisation-resolution |work= [[Hansard]] |publisher= [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom]] |location= [[London]] |format= |volume=565 |id=cc19-20W |date= 18 February 1957 |accessdate=2010-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The establishment of NATO, along with the signing of a succession of treaties establishing the [[OECD|Organisation for European Economic Cooperation]] (April 1948), the [[NATO|North Atlantic Treaty Organisation]] (April 1949), the [[Council of Europe]] (May 1949) and the [[European Coal and Steel Community]] (April 1951), left the Treaty of Brussels and its Western Union devoid of authority.

The treaty was amended at the 1954 [[London and Paris Conferences#Paris|Paris Conference]] as a result of the failure of the [[Treaty establishing the European Defence Community]] to gain French ratification: The [[General Treaty]] ({{lang-de|Deutschlandvertrag}}) of 1952 formally named the EDC as a prerequisite of the end of Allied occupation of Germany, and there was a desire to include Germany in the Western defence architecture. The Modified Brussels Treaty (MBT) transformed the Western Union into the [[Western European Union]] (WEU), at which point Italy and Germany were admitted. Although the WEU established by the Modified Brussels Treaty was significantly less powerful and ambitious than the original Western Union, German membership of the WEU was considered sufficient for the occupation of the country to end in accordance with the General Treaty.

When the [[European Union]] (EU) gained its own mutual defence clause upon the entry into force of the [[Treaty of Lisbon]] in 2009, the members of the WEU - who were also EU [[Member state of the European Union|member states]] 
- regarded the WEU as redundant. Consequently the Modified Treaty of Brussels was terminated on 31 March 2010, followed by the closure of WEU bodies on 30 June 2011.&lt;ref name=statement2010&gt;{{cite web|title=Statement of the Presidency of WEU of 31.03.10|url=http://www.weu.int/Declaration_E.pdf|accessdate=27 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Background===
====Timeline====
*22 January 1948: British foreign minister [[Ernest Bevin]] announces that the United Kingdom will propose, in agreement with their French colleagues, the drafting of a treaty that expands the 1947 [[Treaty of Dunkirk]] to also include the Benelux countries.
*31 January 1948: Benelux foreign ministers declare that their countries agree to begin these talks.
*19 February 1948: France and the United Kingdom submit a draft treaty to the Benelux states.
*4 March 1948: A conference is held in Brussels between the five foreign ministers, from which point the proposal is elaborated, and on 12 March transmitted to the respective governments.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cvce.eu/content/publication/2010/6/8/a7cda832-d25b-4bdf-8731-1c556b10818d/publishable_fr.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

====Motivation====
The treaty was intended to provide [[Western Europe]] with a bulwark against the communist threat and to bring greater collective security. There were cultural and social clauses and concepts for the setting up of a 'Consultative Council'. Co-operation between Western nations was believed to help stop the spread of Communism{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}.

*Luxembourg: 10 June 1948

*France: 25 August 1948, at which point the treaty entered into force

===Implementation===
In September 1948, the parties to the Treaty of Brussels decided to create a military agency under the name of the [[Western Union Defence Organization]]. It consisted of a WU Defence Committee at Prime Ministerial level, and a WU Combined Chiefs of Staff committee, including all the national chiefs of staff, which would direct the operative organisation.&lt;ref&gt;Sean Maloney, 'To Secure Command of the Sea,' the University of New Brunswick thesis 1991, p.95-97 and Lord Ismay, [http://www.nato.int/archives/1st5years/chapters/1.htm#f NATO: The First Five Years]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Field Marshal]] [[Bernard Montgomery]] (UK) was appointed permanent Chairman of the Land, Naval and Air Commanders-in-Committee, with headquarters in [[Fontainebleau]], France. The nominated commanders-in-chief were General [[Jean de Lattre de Tassigny]] (France) as C-in-C, Land Forces, Air Chief Marshal Sir [[James Robb (RAF officer)|James Robb]] (UK) as C-in-C, Air Forces, and [[Robert Jaujard|Vice-Admiral Robert Jaujard]] (France) for the Navy, as Flag Officer Western Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[[NATO]] Archives, [http://www.nato.int/archives/1st5years/chapters/1.htm The First Five Years] and  [http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~content=a791611127~db=all~order=page The Western Union and its defence organisation], RUSI Journal, 1993 (reprint from 1948-9)&lt;/ref&gt; Volume 3 of Nigel Hamilton's ''Life of Montgomery of Alamein'' gives a good account of the disagreements between Montgomery and de Lattre which caused much ill-feeling in the headquarters.

====Cannibalisation and marginalisation====
The treaty was left devoid of much of its authority after the signing of a succession of treaties establishing the [[OECD|Organisation for European Economic Cooperation]] (April 1948), the [[NATO|North Atlantic Treaty Organisation]] (April 1949), the [[Council of Europe]] (May 1949) and the [[European Coal and Steel Community]] (April 1951).

When the division of Europe into two opposing camps became considered unavoidable, the threat of the USSR became much more important than the threat of German rearmament. Western Europe, therefore, sought a new mutual defence pact involving the [[United States]], a powerful military force for such an alliance. The United States, concerned with containing the influence of the USSR, was responsive. The need to back up the commitments of the North Atlantic Treaty with appropriate political and military structures led to the creation of the [[NATO|North Atlantic Treaty Organisation]] (NATO). In December 1950, with the appointment of General [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|Eisenhower]] as the first [[Supreme Allied Commander Europe]] (SACEUR), the members of the Treaty of Brussels decided to merge the [[Western Union]] Military Organisation (WUDO) into NATO.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/1957/feb/18/brussels-treaty-organisation-resolution Hansard extract] February 18, 1957&lt;/ref&gt; NATO's [[Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe]] (SHAPE) took over the WUDO's defence role.

As an effort towards European postwar security co-operation, the treaty was a precursor to [[NATO]] in that it promised European mutual defence. However, it greatly differed from NATO in that it envisaged a purely-European mutual defence pact primarily against Germany. When NATO took shape the next year, on the other hand, it was recognised that Europe was being unavoidably divided into two opposing blocks (western and [[communist]]), and the [[USSR]] was a much greater threat than the possibility of a resurgent Germany, and Western European mutual defence would have to be [[Atlanticism|Atlanticist]] and so include [[North America]].

Trying to avoid the need for West German rearmament, [[Treaty establishing the European Defence Community|a treaty aimed at establishing a European Defence Community]] was signed by the six [[European Coal and Steel Community|ECSC]] members in May 1952 but failed when it was rejected by the French National Assembly in August 1954. This rejection led to the [[London and Paris Conferences]] in September and October, with the result that the Treaty of Brussels was amended by the Protocol signed in [[Paris]] on 23 October 1954, which added [[West Germany]] and [[Italy]] to the [[Western Union Defence Organization]] (WUDO). At this time, the WUDO was renamed the [[Western European Union]], and the Treaty was renamed the Modified Brussels Treaty.

===Modification===
{{main|London and Paris Conferences}}
On 23 October 1954, as a result of the rejection of the [[Treaty establishing the European Defence Community]] by the French parliament and the following [[London and Paris Conferences]], the Treaty of Brussels was amended as the Modified Brussels Treaty. This transformed the Western Union into the Western European Union and admitted West Germany and Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Text of Modified Brussels Treaty on the WEU website at http://www.weu.int/Treaty.htm#1 (Accessed 22 Feb 18)&lt;/ref&gt; Social and cultural aspects were handed to the Council of Europe to avoid duplication of responsibilities within Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cvce.eu/en/collections/unit-content/-/unit/02bb76df-d066-4c08-a58a-d4686a3e68ff/9059327f-7f8a-4a74-ac7e-5a0f3247bcd3/Resources#73277207-d250-41c5-8960-1d8bce9f11aa_en&amp;overlay The Western European Union] On CVCE website&lt;/ref&gt;

===Termination===
In 2009, Article 42.7 of the [[Treaty of Lisbon]] effectively replaced Article V of the Modified Brussels Treaty as the mutual defence clause for EU member states who were also WEU allies. After discussions, the ten WEU member states decided to terminate the Treaty of Brussels on 31 March 2010.&lt;ref name=statement2010/&gt; The activities of WEU were formally terminated in June 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weu.int/documents/Decision_WEU_en.pdf|title=Decision of the Council of the Western European Union on the Residual Rights and Obligations of the WEU|publisher=WEU|date=2011-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maec.es/es/MenuPpal/Actualidad/NoticiasMAEC/Paginas/20100331_not1.aspx|title=Declaración de la Presidencia del Consejo Permanente de la UEO en nombre de las Altas Partes Contratantes del Tratado de Bruselas Modificado|language=spanish|publisher=Foreign Office (Spain)|date=2010-03-31|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111219035147/http://www.maec.es/es/MenuPpal/Actualidad/NoticiasMAEC/Paginas/20100331_not1.aspx|archivedate=2011-12-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Turkish nationality law''' is based primarily on the principle of [[jus sanguinis]]. Children who are born to a [[Turkish women|Turkish mother]] or a [[Turkish people|Turkish]] father (in or out of marriage) are [[Turkey|Turkish]] citizens from birth.
The intention to renounce Turkish citizenship (or acquire citizenship from another state) is submitted in Turkey by a petition to the highest administrative official in the concerned person's place of residence, and when overseas to the [[Diplomatic missions of Turkey|Turkish consulate]]. Documents processed by these authorities are forwarded to the [[Ministry of Interior]] for appropriate action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/pdfid/4a9d204d2.pdf |title=Turkish Citizenship Law |publisher= |date=29 May 2009 |accessdate=2012-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition of citizenship==
[[Image:Epasaport turkey.jpg|thumb|275px|Cover of biometric Turkish passport|alt=cover of Turkish passport (maroon with gold letters)]]
Citizenship is defined in Article 66 of the [[Constitution of Turkey|Turkish constitution]]:
{{quotation|&lt;div&gt;
* Everyone bound to the Turkish state through the bond of citizenship is a Turk.
* The child of a Turkish father or a Turkish mother is a Turk.
* Citizenship can be acquired under the conditions stipulated by law, and shall be forfeited only in cases determined by law.
* No Turk shall be deprived of citizenship, unless he/she commits an act incompatible with loyalty to the motherland.
* Recourse to the courts in appeal against the decisions and proceedings related to the deprivation of citizenship, shall not be denied.
&lt;/div&gt;|{{Ws|[[s:Constitution of the Republic of Turkey|1982 constitution]]}}|Article 66 (as amended on October 17, 2001)}}

==Adoption==
A child adopted by a Turkish citizen automatically becomes a Turkish citizen if under 18 years old on the date the application for adoption was made.  In some cases (although it is not required), those who have foreign names and are applying for Turkish citizenship change their name to a Turkish (but not necessarily a Muslim) name. Examples of people who have done this include football players [[Colin Kazim-Richards]] and [[Mehmet Aurélio]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/football/european_football/article3026150.ece From Bury to Brazil, the rise of a boy called Colin Kazim-Richards] Times Online. Retrieved on 2009-04-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Loss of citizenship==
Naturalization and loss of Turkish citizenship is controlled by the Vital Statistics Office ({{lang-tr|Nüfus ve Vatandaşlık İşleri Genel Müdürlüğü}}), a department of the [[Ministry of the Interior (Turkey)|Ministry of the Interior]].

==The Blue Card as a form of "Citizenship light"==
Former Turkish citizens who were forced to give up their Turkish citizenship (for example, because they have naturalized in a country that usually does not permit [[dual citizenship]], such as Germany or Austria) can apply for the Blue Card (''Mavi Kart''), which gives them some citizens' rights back, e.g. the right to live and work in Turkey, the right to possess land or the right to inherit. Excluded from this "Citizenship light" is the right to vote.

==Naturalization==
A foreign national may apply for nationalization if the following conditions are met:
* [[Age of majority|Legal majority]] as defined by the laws of the applicant's country of origin or those of Turkey in the case of [[statelessness|stateless]] persons,
* Residence in Turkey for an uninterrupted period of five years prior to the application,
* Intention to settle in Turkey and demonstration thereof,
* No risk to public health,
* Good moral character,
* Adequate command of the [[Turkish language]],
* Sufficient income for his or her own livelihood and that of any dependants in Turkey,
* No threat to national security or public order.
Meeting these conditions does not give a foreign national an absolute right to Turkish citizenship.

A foreign national who has been married to a Turkish citizen for three years and is still married to that partner may apply for naturalization under a different set of conditions:
* Residence with the Turkish spouse (exceptions granted if the Turkish spouse dies after application is lodged),
* Absence of acts jeopardising the marriage,
* No threat to national security or public order.
Following a successful application, the naturalised spouse may retain their Turkish citizenship if the marriage should subsequently be  dissolved, so long as both partners had entered into the marriage in good faith.&lt;ref name="unhcr"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/pdfid/4a9d204d2.pdf |title=Turkish Citizenship Law |publisher= |date=29 May 2009 |accessdate=2013-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Citizenship by Investment ==
Since 12 January 2017, Law No 5901 disposes that foreign citizens investing in Turkey will be granted the right to apply for Turkish citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://ftnnews.com/news-from-turkey/31420-foreigners-can-obtain-turkish-citizenship-by-investment.html|title=Foreigners can obtain Turkish citizenship by investment|last=Tore|first=Ozgur|newspaper=FTNnews|accessdate=2017-02-10|language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A foreign national who make one of the following investments or fulfils one of the condition may apply for Turkish citizenship:
* Investment in real estate worth at least 1'000'000 USD, without selling it for a period of at least 3 years,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.expatguideturkey.com/exceptional-turkish-citizenship-application-for-foreign-investors/|title=Turkish Citizenship By Investment|last=|first=|date=2017-01-24|newspaper=Expat Guide Turkey|accessdate=2017-02-10|archiveurl=|archivedate=|deadurl=|language=english|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Investment in a Turkish Company worth at least 2'000'000 USD,
* A deposit of 3'000'000 USD in a Turkish Bank not to be withdrawn for at least 3 years,
* Investment in Government Bonds worth at least 3'000'000 USD not to be sold for at least 3 years,
* Employment of at least 100 Turkish workers in a company owned by the applicant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.byegm.gov.tr/english/agenda/foreign-investment-in-turkey-can-lead-to-turkish-citizenship/104471|title=FOREIGN INVESTMENT IN TURKEY CAN LEAD TO TURKISH CITIZENSHIP {{!}} Office of the Prime Minister - Directorate General of Press and Information|website=www.byegm.gov.tr|language=en-US|accessdate=2017-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The investment made and claimed by the foreign national will be monitored and confirmed by the relevant Government authority. Once the investment is confirmed by the relevant governmental authority, the foreign national will be granted Turkish citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.invest.gov.tr/en-US/infocenter/news/Pages/amendments-ease-access-to-turkish-citizenship-for-foreign-investors.aspx |title=Amendments Ease Access to Turkish Citizenship for Foreign Investors - Invest in Turkey|website=www.invest.gov.tr|accessdate=2017-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dual citizenship==
[[Dual citizenship]] is possible in Turkish law.

The laws of Turkey provide for acquisition of Turkish citizenship based on one's descent—by birth to a Turkish citizen parent (or parents) in Turkey and also by birth abroad to a Turkish citizen parent (or parents)—regardless of the other nationalities a person might acquire at birth. Children born in Turkey to foreign citizens do not have a claim to Turkish citizenship, unless one of the parents is also a Turkish citizen or the child would otherwise be [[statelessness|stateless]].&lt;ref name="unhcr" /&gt; The automatic acquisition (or retention) of a foreign nationality does not affect Turkish citizenship. Turkish laws have no provisions requiring citizens who are born with dual nationality to choose one nationality over the other when they become adults.

While recognizing the existence of dual nationality and permitting Turkish citizens to have other nationalities, the Turkish government requires that those who apply for another nationality inform the relevant Turkish authority (the nearest Turkish embassy or consulate abroad) and provide the original naturalisation certificate, Turkish birth certificate, document attesting to completion of military service (for males), marriage certificate (if applicable) and four photographs. Dual nationals are not required to use a Turkish passport to enter and leave Turkey; it is permitted to travel with a valid foreign passport (or national ID card for some nationals) and the Turkish National ID card.

Since not all countries allow dual citizenship, Turks must sometimes give up their Turkish citizenship in order to naturalise as citizens of another country. 

== Visa requirements for Turkish citizens ==
{{main|Visa requirements for Turkish citizens}}

[[Image:Visa requirements for Turkish citizens.png|thumb|300px|right|Countries and territories with visa-free or visa-on-arrival entries for holders of Turkish passports {{legend|#ff0000|Republic of Turkey}} {{legend|#22b14c|Visa free}}{{legend|greenyellow|Visa issued upon arrival}}{{legend|#6CC29D|Electronic authorization or [[eVisa]]}}{{legend|#79D343|Visa available both on arrival or online}}{{legend|#C0C0C0|Visa required}}]]

Holders of an ordinary Turkish passport may travel without a visa, or with a visa received upon arrival, to 105 countries, as of 1 January 2017 according to the [[Visa (document)#Visa Restrictions Index|Visa Restrictions Index]].

==Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus==
Turkey also provides a special sort of "passport for foreigners" to citizens of the [[Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus]] (TRNC), to enable them to travel freely, as this country is generally not recognized and the TRNC passports are not accepted as valid travel documents in some countries.

Citizens of TRNC are also entitled to become citizens of Turkey if they wish and apply to do so. They are exempt from the above criterea. The only criterea is that they are born [[Turkish Cypriots]], i.e. of a Turkish Cypriot mother or father.

{{Judaism}}
{{Teshuva}}
'''''Tzedakah''''' {{IPA-he|tsedaˈka|}} or ''''' Ṣ'daqah''''' {{IPA-he|sˤəðaːˈqaː|}} in [[Classical Hebrew]] ({{lang-he|צדקה}}), is a [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] word literally meaning "justice" or "righteousness", but commonly used to signify ''[[Charity (practice)|charity]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Rabbi Hayim Halevy |last=Donin |title=To Be A Jew |publisher=Basic Books |location=New York |year=1972 |page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notably, this concept of "charity" is different from the modern Western understanding of "charity", which is typically understood as a spontaneous act of goodwill and a marker of generosity, as ''tzedakah'' is rather an ethical obligation.  In [[Judaism]], ''tzedakah'' refers to the religious obligation to do what is right and just, which Judaism emphasizes is an important part of living a spiritual life.  Thus, unlike voluntary [[philanthropy]], ''tzedakah'' is seen as a religious obligation that must be performed regardless of one's financial standing, and is considered mandatory even for those of limited financial means. More broadly, ''tzedakah'' is considered to be one of the three main acts that can positively influence an unfavorable heavenly decree.

The word ''tzedakah'' is based on the Hebrew (צדק, ''Tzedek'') meaning ''[[righteousness]]'', ''[[Social justice|fairness]]'' or ''[[justice]]'', and is related to the Hebrew word ''[[Tzadik]]'', meaning ''righteous'' as an adjective (or ''righteous individual'' as a noun in the form of a [[Noun#Substantive as a word for noun|substantive]]).  Although the word appears 157 times in the [[Masoretic Text]] of the [[Hebrew Bible]], typically in relation to "righteousness" ''per se'', its use as a term for "charity" in the above sense is an adaptation of [[Rabbinic Judaism]] in [[Talmud|Talmudic]] times.

In the Middle Ages, [[Maimonides]] conceived of an eight-level hierarchy of ''tzedakah'', where the highest form is to give a gift, loan, or partnership that will result in the recipient becoming self-sufficient, instead of living upon others; in his view, the second highest form of ''tzedakah'' is to give donations anonymously to unknown recipients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jtfn.org/sites/default/files/docs/resources/maimonides_ladder_and_tzedakah_texts.pdf |format=PDF |title=Maimonides Eight Degrees of Tzedakah |work=Jewish Teen Funders Network |access-date=November 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Precedents in ancient Israel==

The [[Hebrew Bible]] teaches the obligation to aid those in need, but does not employ one single term for this obligation.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald L. Randle''The JPS guide to Jewish traditions'' Jewish Publication Society, 2004 p. 531 "Tzedakah (hqdx) The Bible repeatedly stresses the obligation to aid those in need, but never designates a special term for this requirement. The Rabbis adopted the word "tzedakah" to apply to charity, primarily in the form ..."&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''tzedekah'' occurs 157 times in the [[Masoretic Text]], typically in relation to "righteousness" per se, usually in the singular, but sometimes in the plural ''tzedekot'', in relation to acts of charity.&lt;ref&gt;"The word "almsgiving", however, is far from expressing the full meaning of the Hebrew ẓedaḳah, which is, charity in the spirit of uprightness or justice. According to the Mosaic conception, wealth is a loan from God, and the poor have a certain claim on the possessions of the rich; while the rich are positively enjoined to share God's bounties with the poor."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Alms" /&gt; In the [[Septuagint]] this was sometimes translated as ''eleemosyne'', "almsgiving."&lt;ref&gt;As per [[Gesenius]] Lexicon; "Deuterony 6:25 καὶ ἐλεημοσύνη ἔσται..."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"... derived from the Greek ἐλεημοσύνη (mercifulness), used by Greek-speaking Jews to denote almost exclusively the offering of charity to the needy, from a feeling of both compassion and righteousness (ẓedaḳah). (See [[LXX]]. (note: Septuagint) on Prov. xxi. 21, and Dan. iv. 24.)"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Alms"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Kohler |first=Kaufmann |title=Alms |url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/1295-alms |work=1906 Jewish Encyclopedia |access-date=November 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In rabbinical literature of the classical and Middle Ages==

In [[classical rabbinical literature]], it was argued that the Biblical regulations concerning left-overs only applied to corn fields, orchards, and vineyards, and not to vegetable gardens; the classical rabbinical writers were much stricter in regard to who could receive the remains. It was stated that the farmer was not permitted to benefit from the [[gleaning]]s, and was not permitted to discriminate among the poor, nor try to frighten them away with dogs or lions ([[Hullin]] 131a, [[Pe'ah]] 5:6)&lt;ref&gt;[[Maimonides]], ''Mishneh Torah'', 4:11&lt;/ref&gt; the farmer was not even allowed to help one of the poor to gather the left-overs. However, it was also argued that the law was only applicable in [[Canaan]], (Jerusalem Talmud. [[Pe'ah]] 2:5) although many classical rabbinical writers who were based in [[Babylon]] observed the laws there ([[Hullin]] 134b)&lt;ref&gt;Maimonides, ''Mishneh Torah'', 1:14&lt;/ref&gt; it was also seen as only applying to Jewish paupers, but poor non-Jews were allowed to benefit for the sake of civil peace.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gittin]] 59b&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Maimonides]] lists his Eight Levels of Giving, as written in the ''[[Mishneh Torah]]'', ''Hilkhot matanot aniyim'' ("Laws about Giving to Poor People"), Chapter 10:7–14:

#Giving an interest-free loan to a person in need; forming a partnership with a person in need; giving a grant to a person in need; finding a job for a person in need, so long as that loan, grant, partnership, or job results in the person no longer living by relying upon others.
#Giving tzedakah anonymously to an unknown recipient via a person (or public fund) which is trustworthy, wise, and can perform acts of tzedakah with your money in a most impeccable fashion.
#Giving tzedakah anonymously to a known recipient.
#Giving tzedakah publicly to an unknown recipient.
#Giving tzedakah before being asked.
#Giving adequately after being asked.
#Giving willingly, but inadequately.
#Giving "in sadness" (giving out of pity): It is thought that Maimonides was referring to giving because of the sad feelings one might have in seeing people in need (as opposed to giving because it is a religious obligation). Other translations say "Giving unwillingly."

==In practice{{anchor|Ma'aser kesafim}}==
[[File:Jewish cemetery Otwock Karczew Anielin IMGP6721.jpg|left|upright|thumb|Tzedakah motif on a Jewish gravestone. Jewish cemetery in [[Otwock]] (Karczew-Anielin).]]
In practice, most Jews carry out ''tzedakah'' by donating a portion of their income to charitable institutions, or to needy people that they may encounter; the perception among many modern-day Jews is that if donation of this form is not possible, the obligation of ''tzedakah'' still requires that something be given. Traditional Jews commonly practice ''ma'sar kesafim,'' tithing 10% of their income to support those in need.

Special acts of ''tzedakah'' are performed on significant days; at weddings, Jewish brides and bridegrooms would traditionally give to charity, to symbolise the sacred character of the marriage; at [[Passover]], a major holiday in Jewish tradition, it is traditional to be welcoming towards hungry strangers, and feed them at the table; at [[Purim]] it is considered obligatory for every Jew to [[Mishloach manot|give food to one other person, and gifts to at least two poor people]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt3309.htm |title=Esther Chapter 9 |work=Mechon Mamre |access-date=November 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; in an amount that would equate to a meal each, for the purpose of increasing the total happiness during [[Adar|the month]].

As for the more limited form of ''tzedakah'' expressed in the biblical laws, namely the leaving of ''[[gleaning]]s'' from certain crops, the [[Shulchan Aruch]] argues that during the exile Jewish farmers are not obliged to obey it.&lt;ref&gt;Shulchan Aruch, ''Yoreh De'ah'' 332:1&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, in modern [[Israel]], rabbis of Orthodox Judaism insist that Jews allow ''gleanings'' to be consumed by the poor and by strangers, and all crops (not just ''gleanings'') by anyone and everyone (free, not bought nor sold) during [[Shmita|sabbatical years]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Rabbi Yaron |last=Ben-David |title=Shmita |url=https://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3445115,00.html |publisher=Ynetnews |date=November 9, 2007 |access-date=November 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, one must be very careful about how one gives out tzedakah money. It is not sufficient to just give to anyone or any organization, rather, one must check the credentials and finances to be sure that your Tzedakah money will be used wisely, efficiently and effectively "Do not steal from a poor person, for (s)he is poor," ([[Book of Proverbs|Proverbs]] 22:22) and from [[Talmud]]ic-era commentaries including [[Numbers Rabba]] 5:2. It is taught that Tzedakah money was never yours to begin with; rather, it always belongs to God, who merely entrusts you with it so that you may use it properly. Hence it is your obligation to ensure that it is received by those deserving of it.

There are many examples of Tzedakah funds that operate according to Maimonides' principles above (particularly #2), including [[Hands on Tzedakah]] (working with nonprofits in the U.S. and in [[Israel]]), and Mitzvah Heroes Fund (working mainly with nonprofits in Israel). [[Paamonim]] is a nonprofit organization in Israel that operates according to Maimonides' first principle.

[[Gaon of Vilna]] considered about giving Tzedaqah ''to all householders in our city with tax-benefit''.

== Analogous concept in Islam ==
The primary counterpart in Islam is [[Zakat]] (Arabic: زكاة), as that refers to one's religious obligation based on those Muslims who meet the necessary criteria of wealth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Yusuf |last=al-Qaradawi |year=1999 |translator-first=Monzer |translator-last=Kahf |title=Fiqh al-Zakah |location=London |volume=1 |isbn=978-967-5062-766 |page=XIX}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Righteous armies]], Korean guerilla fighters, including monks, who resisted the [[Japanese invasions of Korea (1592–98)]]. 
* [[Knights Templar]], [[Knights Hospitaller]] and [[Teutonic Knights]], warriors during the [[Crusades]].
* [[Shaolin Monastery]], a Chinese monastery renowned for monks who were experts in the martial arts.
* [[Ahsham (Mughal Infantry)#Nagas|Naga]] [[sadhu]]s, a militaristic sect of arms-bearing Hindu [[sannyasa|sannyasi]].

In fiction:
* The description of the ideal soldier in the manual of the [[First Earth Battalion]].
* The [[Jedi|Jedi Order]], a fictional monastic organization in the ''[[Star Wars]]'' epic space opera franchise
* The Adeptus Astartes, [[Space Marines (Warhammer 40,000)|Space Marines]], are genetically altered super soldiers who serve the Imperium of Mankind in the [[Warhammer 40,000]] Dystopian Science Fantasy Universe.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4432">The '''Windfall tax''' or '''windfall profits tax''' in [[Mongolia]] was a taxation on the [[profit (accounting)|profit]]s made by [[Mining in Mongolia|mining companies operating in Mongolia]]. It was implemented in 2006 and was the highest [[windfall profits tax]] in the world. It was a tax on unsmelted copper and gold concentrate that was produced in Mongolia. The tax was repealed in 2009 and phased out over two years. Repealing the 68% tax law was considered essential to enable foreign mining companies to invest in mineral resources development of Mongolia.

== Implementation ==
The tax was initially proposed to the [[State Great Khural]] (the Mongolian Parliament) in 2005, initially taxing copper and gold profits when their respective prices reach $2,600 per tonne and $500 per troy ounce.  The bill passed in May 2006, a change to the law occurred in 2006 changing the gold price that would be taxed to $650 per ounce,&lt;ref name=USGS&gt;{{cite web|title=2006 Minerals Yearbook - Mongolia|url=http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/country/2006/myb3-2006-mg.pdf|publisher=United States Geological Survey|accessdate=13 May 2013|page=15.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and eventually to $850 per ounce.  The tax rate was 68%, which was the highest in the world.&lt;ref name="resource investor"&gt;{{cite news|last=Pistilli|first=Melissa|title=Resource Investors to Watch Mongolian Parliamentary Elections|url=http://resourceinvestingnews.com/32963-resource-investors-watch-mongolian-parliamentary-elections-resource-nationalism-rio-tinto-ivanhoe-mines-oyu-tolgoi.html|accessdate=13 May 2013|newspaper=Resource Investing News|date=12 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The tax was implemented with the hopes that copper mining companies would smelt their copper within the country rather than shipping concentrate out&lt;ref name=USGS /&gt; as there would be no windfall tax if the material was smelted in Mongolia.&lt;ref name=repealed&gt;{{cite news|last=Hornby|first=Lucy|title=Mongolia repeals windfall tax, paves way for Ivanhoe|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2009/08/25/mongolia-ivanhoe-tax-idUSPEK9463520090825|accessdate=13 May 2013|newspaper=[[Reuters]]|date=25 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The implementation of the tax was not anticipated by Vancouver-based [[Turquoise Hill Resources|Ivanhoe Mines]], owners of the [[Oyu Tolgoi mine|Oyu Tolgoi Project]] in Mongolia.  Following the announcement by the government shares of Ivanhoe (traded on the [[Toronto Stock Exchange]]) dropped over 21% (or CA$2.22)).&lt;ref name="ivanhoe surprised"&gt;{{cite news|title=Ivanhoe 'surprised' by new Mongolian windfall tax|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/story/2006/05/15/ivanhoe.html|accessdate=13 May 2013|newspaper=[[CBC News]]|date=15 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opposition== 
Ivanhoe made the case that addition of a smelter to the Oyu Tolgoi Project would increase the capital required to bring the project into production.  Others suggested that the small scale independent miners would simply not report their full production to the government, or turn to smuggling to avoid the tax.&lt;ref name=repealed /&gt;  There was opposition to the rate being established by the [[Mongol Bank]] by appointment of the government, and a claim that it was against the [[Constitution of Mongolia|constitution]].  The [[Constitution Court of Mongolia]] later determined that this was not a violation.&lt;ref name=USGS /&gt;  In 2009 the tax was repealed with a phase out period lasting until 2011.&lt;ref name=repealed /&gt; &lt;ref name="china mining"&gt;{{cite news|title=Mongolia tax repeal clears way for $4 bln mine|url=http://www.chinamining.org/News/2009-08-28/1251440323d28672.html|accessdate=13 May 2013|newspaper=China Mining|date=28 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Repeal==
[[Rio Tinto Group|Rio Tinto]] and its partner Ivanhoe Mines made the scrapping of the tax a precondition to their signing an agreement to establish the [[Oyu Tolgoi mine]], a major copper-gold mining project in the [[Gobi Desert]]. The government agreed to the removal of the tax in return for an increase in [[royalties]] from Oyu Tolgoi. The tax was repealed in early 2011, with Oyu Tolgoi commencing commercial production in 2013.&lt;ref name=Tax&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tax-news.com/news/Mongolia_To_Rescind_Mining_Windfall_Tax____38740.html|title=Mongolia To Rescind Mining Windfall|accessdate=14 May 2013|publisher=Tax-news.com, Honkong}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women have played a central role in animal advocacy since the 19th century. The animal advocacy movement&amp;nbsp;– embracing [[animal rights]], [[animal welfare]], and [[Vivisection|anti-vivisectionism]]&amp;nbsp;– has been disproportionately initiated and led by women, particularly in the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;Gaarder, Emily. [http://citation.allacademic.com/meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/1/0/3/8/6/pages103868/p103868-1.php "The 'Gender' Question of Animal Rights: Why are Women the Majority?"], paper presented at the annual meeting of the American Sociological Association, Montreal Convention Center, August 11, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Women are more likely to support animal rights than men.&lt;ref name="SignalAndTaylor2006"&gt;Signal, Tania; Taylor, Nicola. (2006). "Attitudes to Animals: Demographics Within a Community Sample". ''Society &amp; Animals'', 14:2, pages 147–157. doi:10.1163/156853006776778743&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Herzog, Harold. (2007). "Gender Differences in Human-Animal Interactions: A Review". ''Anthrozoos: A Multidisciplinary Journal of The Interactions of People &amp; Animals''. 20:1. Pages 7–21.&lt;/ref&gt; A 1996 study of adolescents by Linda Pifer suggested that factors that may partially explain this discrepancy include attitudes towards [[feminism]] and science, scientific literacy, and the presence of a greater emphasis on "nurturance or compassion" amongst women.&lt;ref&gt;Pifer, Linda. (1996). "Exploring the Gender Gap in Young Adults' Attitudes about Animal Research". ''Society and Animals''. 4:1. Pages 37–52.&lt;/ref&gt; Although [[vegetarianism]] does not necessarily imply animal advocacy, it is also worth noting that a 1992 market research study conducted by the Yankelovich research organization concluded that "of the 12.4 million people [in the US] who call themselves vegetarian, 68% are female, while only 32% are male".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0820/is_n210/ai_16019829 |title=The gender gap: if you're a vegetarian, odds are you're a woman. Why? |accessdate=October 27, 2007 |date=February 1, 2005 |publisher=''[[Vegetarian Times]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
&lt;!--[[Image:Marywollstonecraft.jpg|thumb|right|150px|--&gt;[[Image:Wollstonecraft-right-of-woman.jpg|right|thumb|200px|When the British author [[Mary Wollstonecraft]] wrote ''[[A Vindication of the Rights of Woman]]'' in 1792, an anonymous tract, ''A Vindication of the Rights of Brutes'' (brutes meaning animals) immediately appeared as a parody.]]
Women and animals were often considered equally irrational and inferior in the past. When the British author [[Mary Wollstonecraft]] wrote ''[[A Vindication of the Rights of Woman]]'' in 1792, British philosopher [[Thomas Taylor (neoplatonist)|Thomas Taylor]] responded anonymously in the same year with ''A Vindication of the Rights of Brutes'', in which he claimed that arguments for the oppression or liberation of women applied equally well to animals, intending it as a ''[[reductio ad absurdum]]'' of Wollstonecraft's position.&lt;ref name=Sunstein&gt;Sunstein, Cass R. [https://www.nytimes.com/books/00/02/20/reviews/000220.20sunstet.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin The Chimps' Day in Court], ''The New York Times'', February 20, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the major British animal advocacy groups founded in the late 1800s and early 1900s, all regarded as radical in their time, were founded by women, including the [[Battersea Dogs' Home]] (Mary Tealby, 1860), the [[National Anti-Vivisection Society]] ([[Frances Power Cobbe]], from Ireland, 1875), the [[British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection]] ([[Frances Power Cobbe]], from Ireland, 1898), and the British [[Animal Defence and Anti-Vivisection Society]] ([[Lizzy Lind af Hageby]], from Sweden, and [[Nina Douglas-Hamilton, Duchess of Hamilton]], 1903.)

In 1867 the American philanthropist [[Caroline Earle White]] co-founded the Pennsylvania Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals; she also founded its women's branch in 1869, and founded the [[American Anti-Vivisection Society]] in 1883.&lt;ref name=Buettinger&gt;Buettinger, Craig. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3789786 "Women and antivivisection in late nineteenth century America"], ''Journal of Social History'', Vol. 30, No. 4 (Summer, 1997), pp. 857-872.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1880, the English feminist [[Anna Kingsford]] became one of the first English women to graduate in medicine, after studying for her degree in Paris, and the only student at the time to do so without having experimented on animals. She published ''The Perfect Way in Diet'' (1881), advocating vegetarianism, and was also vocal in her opposition to animal experiments.&lt;ref&gt;[[Deborah Rudacille|Rudacille, Deborah]] (2000). ''The Scalpel and the Butterfly'', pp. 31, 46.&lt;/ref&gt;

The British [[Animal Defence and Anti-Vivisection Society]] came to widespread attention during the [[Brown Dog affair]] (1903–1910), which began when [[Lizzy Lind af Hageby]] infiltrated the [[vivisection]] in University College London of a brown terrier dog. The subsequent description of the experiment in her book, ''The Shambles of Science'' (1903) – in which she wrote that the dog had been conscious throughout and in pain – led to a protracted scandal and a libel case, which the accused researcher won. The affair however continued for several years, making a name both for Lind af Hageby and for the society.&lt;ref name=Kean1995&gt;[[Kean, Hilda]]. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/4289385 "The 'Smooth Cool Men of Science': The Feminist and Socialist Response to Vivisection"], ''History Workshop Journal'', 1995, 40: 16–38.&lt;/ref&gt;

British political scientist [[Robert Garner]] writes that 70 percent of the membership of the Victoria Street Society (one of the anti-vivisection groups founded by [[Frances Power Cobbe]]) were women, as were 70 percent of the membership of the British [[Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals]] in 1900.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Garner|Garner, Robert]]. ''Animals, Politics and Morality''. (2005), p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt;

Australian writer and academic [[Coral Lansbury]] writes that the [[Women's suffrage in the United Kingdom|suffragist movement]] in the United Kingdom became closely linked with the anti-[[vivisection]] movement. Writing about the [[Brown Dog affair]], she argues that the iconography of vivisection struck a chord with women. The vivisected dog muzzled and strapped to the operating board, she argues, was a symbolic reminder of the suffragette on [[hunger strike]] restrained and force-fed in [[Brixton Prison]], as well as women strapped into the gynaecologist's chair by their male doctors, for childbirth, for sterilization, as a cure for "[[hysteria]]", and as objects of study by male medical students.&lt;ref name=Lansbury24&gt;[[Coral Lansbury|Lansbury, Coral]]. ''The Old Brown Dog: Women, Workers, and Vivisection in Edwardian England''. The University of Wisconsin Press, 1985, pp. x and 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern women and animal advocacy==
In 1944 the [[Vegan Society]], a registered charity and the oldest vegan society in the world, was founded on 1 November in the UK by Elsie "Sally" Shrigley, and 24 others.&lt;ref name=Watson&gt;[http://www.vegparadise.com/24carrot610.html "Interview with Donald Watson"], ''Vegetarians in Paradise'', August 11, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first vegan society in the United States was founded in 1948 by Catherine Nimmo and Rubin Abramowitz in California, who distributed [[Donald Watson]]'s newsletter.&lt;ref&gt;Stepaniak 2000, pp.&amp;nbsp;[https://books.google.com/books?id=6Ia5eZIlgLUC&amp;pg=PA6 6–7]; Linda Austin and Norm Hammond, ''Oceano'', Arcadia Publishing, 2010, p.&amp;nbsp;[https://books.google.com/books?id=B51SjziDRGQC&amp;pg=PA39 39]; Freya Dinshah, [http://www.americanvegan.org/AV1001.pdf "Vegan, More than a Dream"], ''American Vegan'', Summer 2010, p.&amp;nbsp;31.&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest documented practice of [[trap-neuter-return]] was in the 1950s, led by animal activist Ruth Plant in the U.K.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Ellen Perry Berkeley, ''TNR: Past, Present and Future: A History of the Trap-Neuter-Return Movement'' (2004: Alley Cat Allies), {{ISBN|0-9705194-2-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1951 the [American] [[Animal Welfare Institute]] was founded by Christine Stevens.

On November 22, 1954, the [[Humane Society of the United States]] was founded by Marcia Glaser, Helen Jones, and two men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://famousdaily.com/history/humane-society-of-us-founded.html |title=Humane Society of United States founded |publisher=Famousdaily.com |date= |accessdate=2015-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1962 the [[Animal Welfare Board of India]] was founded by [[Rukmini Devi Arundale]].

In 1964 the British author [[Ruth Harrison]] published ''Animal Machines'', an influential critique of factory farming, and on October 10, 1965, the British novelist [[Brigid Brophy]] had an article, "The Rights of Animals", published in ''The Sunday Times''.&lt;ref name="ryder5"&gt;[[Richard D. Ryder|Ryder, Richard]] (2000) [1989]. ''Animal Revolution: Changing Attitudes Towards Speciesism'', pp. 5–6. Berg.&lt;/ref&gt; Brophy wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The relationship of [[homo sapiens]] to the other animals is one of unremitting exploitation. We employ their work; we eat and wear them. We exploit them to serve our superstitions: whereas we used to sacrifice them to our gods and tear out their entrails in order to foresee the future, we now sacrifice them to science, and experiment on their entrail in the hope—or on the mere offchance—that we might thereby see a little more clearly into the present&amp;nbsp;... To us it seems incredible that the Greek philosophers should have scanned so deeply into right and wrong and yet never noticed the immorality of slavery. Perhaps 3000 years from now it will seem equally incredible that we do not notice the immorality of our own oppression of animals.&lt;ref name="ryder5"/&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

British political scientist [[Robert Garner]] writes that [[Ruth Harrison]]'s book and [[Brigid Brophy]]'s article led to an explosion of interest in the relationship between humans and nonhumans.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Garner|Garner, Robert]]. ''Animals, Politics and Morality''. (2005), p. 3ff.&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, Brophy's article was discovered in or around 1969 by a group of postgraduate philosophy students at the University of Oxford, Roslind and Stanley Godlovitch (wife and husband from Canada), John Harris, and [[David Wood (philosopher)|David Wood]], now known as the [[Oxford Group (animal rights)|Oxford Group]]. They decided to put together a symposium to discuss the theory of animal rights.&lt;ref name="ryder5"/&gt; Around the same time, the British writer [[Richard D. Ryder]] wrote several letters to ''The Daily Telegraph'' criticizing animal experimentation; these letters were seen by Brophy, who put Ryder in touch with the Godlovitches and Harris. Harrison, Brophy, and Ryder subsequently became contributors to the Godlovitches' symposium, which was published in 1971 as ''[[Animals, Men and Morals: An Inquiry into the Maltreatment of Non-humans]]'' (edited by Roslind and Stanley Godlovitch and John Harris).&lt;ref&gt;Godlovitch, Roslind; Godlovitch Stanley; and Harris John (1971).

The first of these clinics opened in [[Lewisham]] in 1995, and a second opened in [[Canning Town]] in 1999. The Celia Hammond Animal Trust also runs a sanctuary in [[Brede, East Sussex]], for animals which need new homes. In addition to neutering animals, the clinics (and sanctuary) also help to rescue and rehome animals, and now find homes for thousands of cats each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=About Celia | work=Celia Hammond Animal Trust website | url=http://www.celiahammond.org/index.php?module=pagemaster&amp;PAGE_user_op=view_page&amp;PAGE_id=2&amp;MMN_position=2:2 | accessdate=September 10, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Transcript: Rescued dogs | work=BBC News | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/5012662.stm | accessdate=September 10, 2006  | date=May 24, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
