      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2805">'''Alastair Norcross''' is an [[Associate Professor]] of philosophy specializing in [[normative ethics]], [[applied ethics]], and [[political philosophy]].

In 2007, he transferred to [[University of Colorado at Boulder]] from [[Rice University]], where he had been since 2002, after teaching for ten years at [[Southern Methodist University]] in Dallas, where he was the Easterwood Associate Professor of Philosophy. Before that, he taught at [[Hobart and William Smith Colleges]] in [[Geneva, NY]], while finishing his Ph.D. at [[Syracuse University]] in 1991.

In ethics,  Norcross defends a version of act [[utilitarianism]] known as ''scalar utilitarianism'', which is the theory that there are no right or wrong actions, only better or worse actions ranked along a continuum from the action (or actions) that contributes most to overall [[utility]] to the action (or actions) that contributes the least.

'''Alva Noë''' (born 1964) is Professor of Philosophy at the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. The focus of his work is the theory of perception and consciousness. In addition to these problems in [[cognitive science]] and the [[philosophy of mind]], he is interested in [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], the theory of art, [[Wittgenstein]], and the origins of analytic philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://socrates.berkeley.edu/~noe/]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Noë holds a  [[B.Phil.]] from the [[University of Oxford]] and a [[Ph.D.]] from [[Harvard University]].

==Philosophical work==
Noë joined the [[UC Berkeley]] Department of Philosophy as an associate professor in 2003, where he was a member of the UC Berkeley Institute for Cognitive and Brain Sciences, serving as a core faculty member for the Program in Cognitive Science and the Center for New Media. During 2011-12, he was Distinguished Professor of Philosophy at the City University of New York Graduate Center.  Before coming to Berkeley, Noë was an assistant professor of philosophy at [[UC Santa Cruz]]. He has been a Post-doctoral Research Associate of the Center for Cognitive Studies at Tufts University, a Visiting Scholar at the Department of Logic and Philosophy of Science at UC Irvine and at the Institut Jean-Nicod (CNRS/EN/EHESS) in Paris, a McDonnell-Pew Visiting Fellow at the Oxford Center for Cognitive Neuroscience, and a visiting scholar at the Center for Subjectivity Research at the University of Copenhagen. Noë has been a recipient of a UC President's Fellowship in the Humanities and an ACLS/Ryskamp Fellowship, and in 2007/2008 was a research fellow at the [[Wissenschaftskolleg zu Berlin]].

Noë is the author of the books ''Strange Tools'' (2015),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Strange Tools: Art and Human Nature|last=Alva|first=Noë|publisher=Hill and Wang|year=2015|isbn=978-0809089178|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;''Varieties of Presence'' (2012),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Varieties of Presence|last=Noë|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=2012|isbn=978-0674062146|first1=Alva}}&lt;!--|accessdate=2014-09-13 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; ''Out of Our Heads'' (2009)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Out of Our Heads: Why You Are Not Your Brain, and Other Lessons from the Biology of Consciousness|last=Noë|publisher=Hill and Wang|year=2010|isbn=978-0809016488|first1=Alva}}&lt;!--|accessdate=2014-09-13 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Action In Perception'' ([[MIT Press]], 2004).&lt;ref name="Noë 2004"&gt;{{cite book | last=Noë | first=Alva | title=Action in perception | publisher=MIT Press | location=Cambridge, Mass | year=2004 | isbn=978-0-262-14088-1 | page=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is the co-editor of ''Vision and Mind: Selected Readings in the Philosophy of Perception'' (MIT Press, 2002) and the editor of ''Is the Visual World a Grand Illusion?''

{{Marxism|Variants}}

'''Analytical Marxism''' is an approach to [[Marxist]] theory that was prominent amongst English-speaking philosophers and social scientists during the 1980s. It was mainly associated with the September Group of academics, so called because of their biennial September meetings to discuss common interests. Self-described as "Non-Bullshit Marxism",{{ref|Cohen1}} the group was characterized, in the words of [[David Miller (political theorist)|David Miller]], by "clear and rigorous thinking about questions that are usually blanketed by ideological fog."{{ref|Miller1}} Members of this school seek to apply the techniques of [[analytic philosophy]], along with tools of modern social science such as [[rational choice theory]] to the elucidation of the theories of [[Karl Marx]] and his successors. 

The best-known analytical Marxist was Oxford University philosopher [[G. A. Cohen]], whose ''[[Karl Marx's Theory of History: A Defence]]'' (1978) helped start the school. In that book, Cohen attempted to apply the tools of logical and linguistic analysis to the elucidation and defense of Marx's [[materialist conception of history]].&lt;ref name="Monthly Review"&gt;http://mrzine.monthlyreview.org/2009/farmelant080809.html&lt;/ref&gt; Other prominent analytical Marxists include the economist [[John Roemer]], the social scientist [[Jon Elster]], and the sociologist [[Erik Olin Wright]]. They all have attempted to build upon Cohen's work by bringing to bear modern social science methods, such as rational choice theory, to supplement Cohen's use of analytic philosophical techniques in the interpretation of Marxian theory.

Cohen would later engage directly with [[John Rawls|Rawlsian]] political philosophy in an attempt to advance a [[socialism|socialist]] theory of justice that stands in contrast to both traditional [[Marxism]] and the theories advanced by political philosophers such as the [[social liberalism|left-liberal]] John Rawls and the [[right-libertarianism|right-libertarian]] [[Robert Nozick]]. In particular, he points to Marx's maxim of "[[from each according to his ability, to each according to his needs]]."

==Origin==

Analytical Marxism is understood to have originated with the publication of G. A. Cohen's ''Karl Marx's Theory of History: A Defence'' (1978).&lt;ref&gt;Levine, A. and Olin Writght, E., 1980. Rationality and Class Struggle in New Left Review, I/123, September–October 1980&lt;/ref&gt; Cohen's book was, from the outset, intended as a defence of [[historical materialism]].{{ref|Cohen2}} Cohen painstakingly reconstructed historical materialism through a close reading of Marx's texts, with the aim of providing the most logically coherent and parsimonious account. For Cohen, Marx's historical materialism is a  [[technological determinism|technologically deterministic]] theory, in which the economic [[relations of production]] are functionally explained by the material [[forces of production]], and in which the political and legal institutions (the "superstructure") are [[Base and superstructure|functionally]] explained by the relations of production (the "base"). The transition from one [[mode of production]] to another is driven by the tendency of the productive forces to develop. Cohen accounts for this tendency by reference to the rational character of the human species: where there is the opportunity to adopt a more productive technology and thus reduce the burden of labour, human beings will tend to take it. Thus, human history can be understood as a series of rational steps that increase human productive power.

==Theory==

=== Exploitation ===

At the same time as Cohen was working on ''Karl Marx's Theory of History'', American economist John Roemer was employing [[neoclassical economics]] to defend the Marxist concepts of [[Exploitation of labour|exploitation]] and [[Marxian class theory|class]]. In his ''[[A General Theory of Exploitation and Class]]'' (1982), Roemer employed [[rational choice]] and [[game theory]] to demonstrate how exploitation and class relations may arise in the development of a market for labour. Roemer would go on to reject the necessity of the [[labour theory of value]] to explain exploitation and class. Value was in principle capable of being explained in terms of any class of commodity inputs, such as oil, wheat, etc., rather than being exclusively explained by embodied labour power. Roemer was led to the conclusion that exploitation and class were thus generated not in the sphere of production but of market exchange. Significantly, as a purely technical category, exploitation did not always imply a moral wrong (see section [[#Justice|Justice]] below).

===Rational choice Marxism===

By the mid-1980s, "analytical Marxism" was being recognised as a "[[paradigm]]".{{ref|Roemer}} The September Group had been meeting for several years, and a succession of texts by its members were published. Several of these appeared under the imprint of Cambridge University Press's series "Studies in Marxism and Social Theory", including [[Jon Elster]]'s ''[[Making Sense of Marx]]'' (1985) and [[Adam Przeworski]]'s ''Capitalism and Social Democracy'' (1985). Among the most methodologically controversial were these two authors, and Roemer, due to their use of rational-actor models. Not all analytical Marxists are rational-choice Marxists, however.{{ref|Veneziani}}

Elster's account was an exhaustive examination of Marx's texts in order to ascertain what could be salvaged out of Marxism employing the tools of rational choice theory and [[methodological individualism]] (which Elster defended as the only form of explanation appropriate to the social sciences). His conclusion was that – contra Cohen – no general theory of history as the development of the productive forces could be saved. Like Roemer, he also rejected the labour theory of value and, going further, virtually all of [[Marxian economics]]. The "dialectical" method is rejected as a form of [[G. W. F. Hegel|Hegelian]] [[obscurantism]]. The theory of ideology and revolution continued to be useful to a certain degree, but only once they had been purged of their tendencies to [[holism]] and [[Structural functionalism|functionalism]] and established on the basis of an individualist methodology and a causal or intentional explanation.

Przeworski's book uses rational choice and game theory in order to demonstrate that the [[revolutionary socialism|revolutionary]] strategies adopted by socialists in the twentieth century were likely to fail, since it was in the rational interests of workers to strive for the reform of capitalism through the achievement of [[labor union|union]] recognition, improved wages and living conditions, rather than adopting the risky strategy of revolution.{{Citation needed|reason=Wrong again, see what he says about Kolm, even social democratic class struggle leads to capital flight, etc., so moderation is rational; the general strike was a universal disaster according to Przeworski, so revolution just isn't an issue for developed countries|date=March 2010}} Przeworski's book is clearly influenced by economic explanations of political behaviour advanced by thinkers such as [[Anthony Downs]] (''[[An Economic Theory of Democracy]]'', 1957) and [[Mancur Olson]] (''The Logic of Collective Action'', 1965).{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}

===Justice===
The analytical (and rational choice) Marxists held a variety of leftist political sympathies, ranging from [[communism]] to reformist [[social democracy]]. Through the 1980s, most of them began to believe that Marxism as a theory capable of explaining revolution in terms of the economic dynamics of capitalism and the class interests of the proletariat had been seriously compromised. They were largely in agreement that the transformation of capitalism was an ethical project. During the 1980s, a debate had developed within Anglophone academia about whether Marxism could accommodate a theory of justice. This debate was clearly linked to the revival of normative political philosophy after the publication of [[John Rawls]]'s ''[[A Theory of Justice]]'' (1971). Some commentators remained hostile to the idea of a Marxist theory of justice, arguing that Marx saw "justice" as little more than a bourgeois ideological construct designed to justify exploitation by reference to reciprocity in the wage contract.{{ref|Wood1}}

The analytical Marxists, however, largely rejected this point of view. Led by G. A. Cohen (a moral philosopher by training), they argued that a Marxist theory of justice had to focus on [[egalitarianism]]. For Cohen, this meant an engagement with moral and political philosophy in order to demonstrate the injustice of market exchange, and the construction of an appropriate egalitarian metric. This argument is pursued in Cohen's books, ''Self-Ownership, Freedom and Equality'' (1995) and ''If You're an Egalitarian How Come You're So Rich?'' (2000b).

Cohen departs from previous Marxists by arguing that capitalism is a system characterised by unjust exploitation not because the labour of workers is "stolen" by employers, but because it is a system wherein "autonomy" is infringed and which results in a distribution of benefits and burdens that is unfair. In the traditional Marxist account, exploitation and injustice occur because non-workers appropriate the value produced by the labour of workers. This would be overcome in a [[socialist]] society where no class would own the [[means of production]] and be in a position to appropriate the value produced by labourers. Cohen argues that underpinning this account is the assumption that workers have "rights of [[self-ownership]]" over themselves and thus, should "own" what is produced by their labour. Because the worker is paid a wage less than the value he or she creates through work, the capitalist is said to extract a [[surplus-value]] from the worker's labour, and thus to steal part of what the worker produces, the time of the worker and the worker's powers.

Cohen argues that the concept of self-ownership is favourable to Rawls's difference principle as it ensures "each person's rights over his being and powers"{{ref|Cohen3}} — i.e. that [[Categorical imperative|one is treated as an end always and never as a means]] — but also highlights that its centrality provides for an area of common ground between the Marxist account of justice and the [[right-libertarianism]] of [[Robert Nozick]]. However, much as Cohen criticises Rawls for treating people's personal powers as just another external resource for which no individual can claim desert, so does he charge Nozick with moving beyond the ''concept'' of self-ownership to his own [[right-wing]] "thesis" of self-ownership. In Cohen's view, Nozick's mistake is to endow people's claims to legitimately acquire external resources with the same moral quality that belongs to people's ownership of themselves. In other words, [[proprietarianism]] allows inequalities to arise from differences in talent and differences in external resources, but it does so because it assumes that the world is "up for grabs",{{ref|Cohen4}} that it can be justly appropriated as private property, with virtually no restriction(s).

==Criticisms==
Analytical Marxism received criticism from a number of different quarters, both Marxist and non-Marxist.

===Method===
{{Refimprove section|date=March 2010}}
A number of critics argued that analytical Marxism proceeded from the wrong methodological and [[epistemological]] premises.  While the analytical Marxists dismissed "dialectically oriented" Marxism as "bullshit", others maintain that the distinctive character of Marxist philosophy is lost if it is understood "non-dialectically". The crucial feature of Marxist philosophy is that it is not a reflection in thought of the world, a crude materialism, but rather an intervention in the world concerned with human [[Praxis (process)|praxis]]. According to this view, analytical Marxism wrongly characterizes intellectual activity as occurring in isolation from the struggles constitutive of its social and political [[conjuncture]], and at the same time does little to intervene in that conjuncture. For dialectical Marxists, analytical Marxism eviscerated Marxism, turning it from a systematic doctrine of revolutionary transformation into a set of discrete theses that stand or fall on the basis of their logical consistency and empirical validity.

Analytical Marxism's non-Marxist critics also raised methodological objections. Against Elster and the rational choice Marxists, Carver{{ref|Carver}} argued that methodological individualism was not the only form of valid explanation in the social sciences, that functionalism in the absence of micro-foundations could remain a convincing and fruitful mode of inquiry, and that rational choice and game theory were far from being universally accepted as sound or useful ways of modelling social institutions and processes.

===History===
Cohen's defence of a technological determinist interpretation of historical materialism was, in turn, quite widely criticised, even by analytical Marxists. Together with Andrew Levine, Wright argued that in attributing primacy to the productive forces (the development thesis), Cohen overlooked the role played by class actors in the transition between modes of production. For the authors, it was forms of class relations (the relations of production) that had primacy in terms of how the productive forces were employed and the extent to which they developed. It was not evident, they claimed, that the relations of production become "fetters" once the productive forces are capable of sustaining a different set of production relations.{{ref|Levine}} Likewise, Cornell political philosopher [[Richard W. Miller]], while sympathetic with Cohen's analytical approach to Marxism, rejected Cohen's technological interpretation of historical materialism, to which he counterpoised with what he called a "mode of production" interpretation which placed greater emphasis on the role of class struggle in the transition from one mode of production to another.{{ref|Miller2}} The Greek philosopher [[Nicholas Vrousalis]] generalized Miller's critique, pointing out that Cohen's distinction between the material and social properties of society cannot be drawn as sharply as Cohen's materialism requires.{{ref|Vrousalis}}

Other non-Marxist critics argued that Cohen, in line with the Marxist tradition, underestimated the role played by the legal and political superstructure in shaping the character of the economic base.{{ref|Carter}} Finally, Cohen's anthropology was judged dubious: whether human beings adopt new and more productive technology is not a function of an ahistorical rationality, but depends on the extent to which these forms of technology are compatible with pre-existing beliefs and social practices.{{ref|Hirst}} Cohen recognised and accepted some, though not all, of these criticisms in his ''[[History, Labour, and Freedom]]'' (1988).

Roemer's version of the cause of change in the mode of production as due to being inequitable rather than inefficient is also the source of criticism. One such criticism is that his argument relies of the legal ownership of production which is only present in later forms of class society rather than the social relations of production.{{ref|Hirst}}

===Justice and power===
Some Marxists argue, against analytical Marxist theories of justice, that it is mistaken to suppose that Marxism offers a theory of justice {{ref|Wood2}}; others question analytical Marxists' identification of justice with rights.{{ref|Furner1}}. The question of justice cannot be seen in isolation from questions of power, or from the balance of class forces in any specific [[conjuncture]]. Non-Marxists may employ a similar criticism in their critique of liberal theories of justice in the Rawlsian tradition. They argue that the theories fail to address problems about the configuration of power relations in the contemporary world, and by so doing appear as little more than exercises in logic. "Justice", on this view, is whatever is produced by the assumptions of the theory. It has little to do with the actual distribution of power and resources in the world.

== Etymology ==
The name comes from the Sanskrit words ''baddha'' (बद्ध, baddha) meaning "bound", ''kona'' (कोण, koṇa) meaning "angle" or "split",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ashtangayoga.info/practice/asana-vinyasa-series/primary-series-yoga-chikitsa/item/baddha-konasana-a/ | title=Baddha Konasana |publisher=Ashtanga Yoga | accessdate=11 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Asana'' (आसन, Āsana) meaning "posture" or "seat".&lt;ref name="Sinha1996"&gt;{{cite book |last=Sinha |first=S. C. |title=Dictionary of Philosophy |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-zzRvh1fRzEC&amp;pg=PA18 |date=1 June 1996 |publisher=Anmol Publications |isbn=978-81-7041-293-9 |page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==

From sitting position with both the legs outstretched forward, hands by the sides, palms resting on the ground, fingers together pointing forward, the legs are hinged at the knees so the soles of the feet meet. The legs are grasped at the ankles and folded more until the heels reach the perineum. The knees remain on the ground, the body erect and the gaze in front. The asana is held before coming back to the starting position. The thighs are stretched with care.

== Benefits ==

It is a strong groin- and hip-opener and one of the few asanas that can be practiced comfortably soon after eating as long as the head is not rested on the floor. The asana is specially recommended for those suffering from urinary disorders. The pelvis, the abdomen and the back are stimulated by a plentiful blood supply.&lt;ref name="cny"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cnyhealingarts.com/2010/10/15/the-health-benefits-of-baddha-konasana-bound-angle-pose/ | title=The Health Benefits of Baddha Konasana (Bound Angle Pose) | publisher=www.cnyhealingarts.com | date=October 15, 2010 | accessdate=16 July 2013 | author=Kiltz, Dr. Rob}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="evaidyaji"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.evaidyaji.com/Ayurvedic/Yoga/Baddha_Konasana | title=Baddha Konasana | publisher=evaidyaji | accessdate=16 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It relieves sciatic pain and prevents hernia. If practised regularly, it relieves pain and heaviness in the testicles. For women, coupled with [[Sarvangasana]], it checks irregular menses and helps the ovaries to function properly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Iyengar |first=B. K. S. |authorlink=B. K. S. Iyengar |title=Illustrated Light On Yoga |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pbx5AAAACAAJ |date=1 October 2005 |publisher=HarperCollins |isbn=978-81-7223-606-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regular practise of this asana may be beneficial for the lumbar region, flat feet, high blood pressure, infertility and asthma.&lt;ref name="yogawiz"&gt;{{cite web | first1=Kevin | last1=Pederson | url=http://www.yogawiz.com/articles/59/yoga-asana-benefits/baddha-konasana-a-great-asana-for-hip-and-groin.html | title=Health Benefits Of Bound Angle Pose (Baddha Konasana) | publisher=yogawiz.com/ | accessdate=16 July 2013 | website=yogawiz.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Precautions ==
While doing the asana, take care that:&lt;ref name="evaidyaji" /&gt;
* This asana should be avoided in case of Groin or knee injury.
* Be careful while bending if you suffer from [[High blood pressure]] or any [[Cardiac disease|cardiac problems]].
* Be slow and careful while doing the asana as in almost all the yoga asanas, as being quick is not what is called for in any yogic Asanas.
* Baddha Konasana should be avoided by ladies if menstruating or should be performed under guidance of a yoga expert during those days.

== Variations ==

Supta Baddha Koṇāsana,&lt;ref name="Bhagat2004"&gt;{{cite book | author=Bhagat| title=Alternative Therapies| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oKfvc8bvGwsC&amp;pg=PA40| year=2004| publisher=Jaypee Brothers Publishers| isbn=978-81-8061-220-6| page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cobbler's Pose in Lying Position, ''supta'' (सुप्त) meaning "supine" or "reclining".

Sir '''Christopher Martin Dobson''', [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]], [[Academy of Medical Sciences, United Kingdom|FMedSci]] (born 8 October 1949) is a British [[chemistry|chemist]], who is the John Humphrey Plummer Professor of [[Chemical biology|Chemical]] and [[Structural Biology]] in the [[Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge|Department of Chemistry]] at the [[University of Cambridge]], and Master of [[St John's College, Cambridge]].&lt;ref name=cv/&gt;&lt;ref name=microsoft&gt;{{AcademicSearch|3116244}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Dobson was born on 8 October 1949.&lt;ref name=Who&gt;{{Who's Who | surname = DOBSON | othernames = Prof. Christopher Martin | id = U13819 | volume = 2014 | edition = online [[Oxford University Press]]}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was educated at Hereford Cathedral Junior School, and then [[Abingdon School]] from 1960 until 1967.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.abingdon.org.uk/uploads/school/files/abingdonian/1968_January_V014_N004.pdf#page=58|title=Chemistry Prizes|publisher=The Abingdonian}}&lt;/ref&gt; He completed a [[Bachelor of Arts]] and [[Doctor of Philosophy|D.Phil]]&lt;ref name=dobsondphil&gt;{{cite thesis |degree=DPhil |first=Christopher Martin|last=Dobson |title=The conformation of lysozyme in solution |publisher=University of Oxford |date=2014 |url=https://www.google.com|authorlink=Chris Dobson}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[University of Oxford]] ([[Keble College, Oxford|Keble]] and [[Merton College, Oxford|Merton Colleges]]).

==Research==
Dobson's research is largely concerned with [[protein folding|protein folding and misfolding]], and its links with medical disorders particularly Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. His research interests are focused on protein molecules, and particularly on defining the fundamental principles by which they fold to generate function and biological activity, and yet can misfold to generate toxicity and disease. His studies are highly interdisciplinary and collaborative, and make use of a very wide range of techniques, encompassing theory as well as experiment. The Dobson group based at the [[Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge]] &lt;ref name=cv/&gt; is particularly interested in the discovery of the nature, properties, mechanism of formation and biological significance of the ‘misfolded’ amyloid state of proteins. Amyloid-related diseases include whole-body disorders such as the systemic amyloidoses, neuronal disorders such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, and other organ-specific disorders such as type II diabetes. The major goals are the elucidation of the general molecular principles that underlie this whole family of medical conditions, which are now becoming a major threat to human health and social harmony across the modern world, and the generation of a firm foundation for the rational and effective prevention and treatment of these debilitating and usually fatal conditions.&lt;ref name=cv/&gt; Dobson is an author or co-author of nearly 700 papers and review articles, including more than 30 in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' and ''[[Science (magazine)|Science]]'', which have been cited over 50,000 times. His current [[h-index]] is 110.&lt;ref name=scopus&gt;{{Scopus|id=36042495400}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Dobson held Research Fellowships at Merton College and then [[Linacre College, Oxford|Linacre College]] before working at [[Harvard University]]. He returned to Oxford in 1980 as a [[Oxbridge Fellow|Fellow]] of [[Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford]] and as a University Lecturer in Chemistry, later receiving promotions to [[Reader (academic rank)|Reader]], then Professor, of Chemistry.&lt;ref name=Who/&gt; Dobson has been at Cambridge since 2001 and has been Master of St John's College, Cambridge since 2007.

==Awards and honours==
In 2009 Dobson was awarded the [[Royal Medal]] by the Royal Society "for his outstanding contributions to the understanding of the mechanisms of protein folding and mis-folding, and the implications for disease", and in 2014 he received both the Heineken Prize for Biochemistry and Biophysics and the [[Feltrinelli Prize|Feltrinelli International Prize]] for Medicine. Dobson was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society|Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS)]] in 1996. His nomination reads: {{centered pull quote|Dobson is distinguished for his studies, principally using [[Nuclear magnetic resonance|NMR methods]], of the structures and dynamics of proteins in solution. Such studies include those on [[lysozyme]], with which he demonstrated many methodological advances, [[Interleukin 4|interleukin-4]], with which he established for the first time the topology of the important family of [[Haematopoiesis|haemopoietic]] helical [[cytokine]]s, and [[urokinase]]-type [[plasminogen activator]], with which he elucidated the dynamic characteristics of multidomain [[Fibrinolysis|fibrinolytic proteins]], Dobson is a pioneer in the application of NMR methods to the problem of protein folding, which is now the major theme of his work. His studies on lysozyme are resulting in one of the most detailed descriptions of a folding pathway for a protein. Dobson has explored the properties and reactions of molecules in solids by means of NMR spectroscopy, including [[protein]]s, [[Organometallic chemistry|organometallic compounds]], [[inorganic]] [[Paramagnetism|paramagnets]] and the silicaceous components of hydraulic materials. Notable here are analyses of the nature and origin of dynamic properties in molecular solids, and their relationship to structure and reactivity.&lt;ref name=royal&gt;{{cite web |url=https://collections.royalsociety.org/DServe.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&amp;dsqApp=Archive&amp;dsqDb=Catalog&amp;dsqCmd=show.tcl&amp;dsqSearch=(RefNo==%27EC%2F1996%2F06%27) |title=EC/1996/06: Dobson, Christopher Martin |publisher=The Royal Society |archivedate=30 September 2014 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6SyQujALd?url=https://collections.royalsociety.org/DServe.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&amp;dsqApp=Archive&amp;dsqDb=Catalog&amp;dsqCmd=show.tcl&amp;dsqSearch=%28RefNo%3D%3D%27EC%2F1996%2F06%27%29 |location=London |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all |access-date=30 September 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:Dean_Komel.jpg|thumb|Dean Komel]]

'''Dean Komel''' (born 7 June 1960) is a [[Slovenia]]n [[philosopher]].

He was born in the small village of [[Bilje, Miren-Kostanjevica|Bilje]] in the [[Goriška]] region of [[Slovenia]], then part of the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]].

After finishing the [[Nova Gorica Grammar School]], he studied [[philosophy]] and [[comparative literature]] at the [[University of Ljubljana]]. After further studies under [[Bernhard Waldenfels]] and [[Klaus Held]] in [[Germany]], he obtained his [[PhD]] in 1995 on the theme of a hermeneutic critique of the anthropological orientation in contemporary philosophy. He is the professor of contemporary philosophy and the philosophy of culture at the Department of Philosophy at the Faculty of Arts of the University of Ljubljana. He is additionally president of the Phenomenological Society in [[Ljubljana]] and is on the editorial board of a number of journals for philosophy and culture, including ''Phainomena'', ''[[Nova revija (magazine)|Nova revija]]'', ''Orbis Phaenomenologicus''. Since 2005 he has also headed research activities at the  [http://www.institut-nr.si Humanistic institute of Nova revija]. He has lectured at numerous universities and international symposia. Hermeneutic questions of contemporary philosophy stand out in his philosophical works. Within this context he develops philosophical reflection on language, historicity, art, interculturality and humanistics.

Komel is considered one of the major exponents of the [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenological]] current in Slovene philosophy, continuating the tradition of [[France Veber]], [[Dušan Pirjevec Ahac]], [[Ivan Urbančič]] and [[Tine Hribar]]. In 2003 he received the Zois Award of the Republic of Slovenia for top scientific achievements in the field of philosophy.

'''Dvādaśānta''' ([[Sanskrit]]: द्वादशान्त) or the ''Brahmarandhra'', meaning – having an end or limit of twelve, it is the ''twelve fingers’ breath'', the 12th centre (or ''[[Shakti|śakti]]'' in an individual) identified by some with the [[pituitary gland]], there being six centers in the brain and six below the brain. This term refers to – a) externally to the place where the breath dies away, b) internally to the crown of the skull and known as ''brahmarandhra'', and c) above the skull to the ''dvādaśānta'' which is twelve fingers breadth away from the ''brahmarandhra'', and when no longer identified with the body but with the all-pervading [[Shiva]] it is the Cosmic ''dvādaśānta'', a wheel with a thousand spokes, eternally present. ''Dvādaśānta'' is like the ''triśūla'' signifying three kinds of energy – of the will, of knowledge and of activity. The initial extremity (''ādi-koti'') is the heart (whence the breath rises) but the final extremity (''anta-koti'') is the ''dvādaśānta'' (where the breath finally dies away or rests).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Kundalini: The Energy of the Depths|author=Lilian Silbum|publisher=SUNY Press|pages=31, 49|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=EYWmc0gfYyIC|date=1988|isbn=9780887068003|accessdate=2015-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Pratyabhijna Philosophy|author=Ganesh vasudeo Tagare|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=104|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=GW6UtkgT-CcC|date=2002|isbn=9788120818927|accessdate=2015-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Abhinavagupta]] tells us that Shiva makes the [[sādhaka]] seek a worthy teacher and makes that teacher take up that task with extra responsibility and lead his [[Guru-shishya tradition|śiśya]] towards liberation. The ''ānavopāya'' ('atomic') method utilises the creative functions of Shiva and raises the ''sādhaka'' to ''śaktopāya'' ('method of power') that employs the cognitive functions of the Lord. In this and other two succeeding methods [[mantra]] transmitted by the teacher to the ''śiśya'' plays a vital role. According to the ''Devyā-yāmala- tantra'', the subtle breath composed of sound rising from the former’s heart moves through a series of centers to rest in the ''dvādaśānta'' which is the terminal point where the [[Nadi (yoga)|suśumnā]] ends and the central pathway of the three paths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Tantric Heart|author=Paul Eduardo Muller-Ortega|publisher=SUNY Press|page=168|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=ObmRkyVbgDUC|date=1989|isbn=9780887067860|accessdate=2015-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vijñānabhirava ([[Dhāraṇā]] 28 [[shloka]] 51) states:-
:यथा तथा यत्र तत्र द्वादशान्ते मनः क्षिपेत् |
:प्रतिक्षणं क्षीणवृत्तेर्वैलक्षण्यं दिनैर्भवेत् ||
which statement means that the ''ānavopāya'' involves fixation of the mind again and again at ''ūrdhava dvādaśānta'' or ''bāhya dvādaśānta'' or ''āntara dvādaśānta'' which is the incomparable and ineffable state of [[Bhairava]] (an aspect of Shiva).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Yoga of Delight, Wonder and Astonishment|page=47|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=aVc5JCnO1VgC|date=1991|publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=9780791410738|accessdate=2015-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; This text had earlier in ''shloka'' 28 explained that meditation on ''prāṇaśakti'' arising from the ''[[Muladhara|mūladhārā chakra]]'' getting subtler and subtler dissolves in ''dvādaśānta'' to manifest Bhairava.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Vijnanabhairava or Divine Consciousness|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=25|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=2R2iSiMbuVwC|date=1979|isbn=9788120808201|accessdate=2015-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the ''apāna'' remains in the ''dvādaśānta'', it is known as the external ''[[kumbhaka]]'' (retention of breath as in a pot). When the '' [[Prana|prāṇa]] '' moves up to the nose-tip it is known as ''recaka'' and when it moves up to the extent of the ''dvādaśānta'' it is called ''external-recaka''. The ''apāna'' moving inwards without the ''prāṇa'' is the ''internal-kumbhaka'', and the ''apāna'' rising in the ''dvādaśānta'' attaining internal expansion is the ''internal-pūraka''. According to Yoga Vasiśtha, the one who knows (experienced) these ''kumbhakas'' becomes liberated from the cycle of birth and rebirth;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Concise Yoga Vasistha|publisher=SUNY Press|page=283|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=fe_5bUKSaUEC|date=1981|isbn=9780873959551|accessdate=2015-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''dvādśānta'' represents the highest seat of God in the body, the seat of the vibrating Self.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Laksmi Tantra|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=250,332|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=pENlKmZ4r94C|date=2000|isbn=9788120817357|accessdate=2015-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10642">The term '''emotional affair''' is used in the media to categorise or explain a certain type of relationship.

High levels of non-sexual emotional intimacy in adults may occur without the participants being bound by other intimate relationships or may occur between people in other relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.counseling.ufl.edu/cwc/Types-of-Intimacy.aspx|title=University of Florida Counseling and Wellness Center Types - Types of Intimacy}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Attachment Theory" research reflects both constructs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://talkitover.in/self/understanding-our-attachments-to-others/|title=Understanding our attachments to others}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term often describes a bond between two people that mimics the closeness and emotional intimacy of a romantic relationship while never being [[physical intimacy|physically consummated]].  An emotional affair is sometimes referred to as an ''affair of the heart''.  An emotional affair may emerge from a [[friendship]], and progress toward greater levels of personal intimacy and attachment. What distinguishes an emotional affair from a friendship is the assumption of emotional roles between the two participants that mimic of those of an actual relationship - with regards to confiding personal information and turning to the other person during moments of vulnerability or need.

The intimacy between the people involved usually stems from a friendship with confidence to tell each other intimate aspects of themselves, their relationships, or even subjects they wouldn't talk with their partners. While not physical, this relationship can quickly pass that barrier, and while the first physical contact can take a long time to happen (e.g. a kiss), what follows next is usually followed quickly due to the such high levels of intimacy already existent between the two.

==Definition==
An emotional affair can be defined as: &lt;blockquote&gt; "A relationship between a person and someone other than (their) spouse that affects the level of intimacy, emotional distance and overall dynamic balance in the marriage. The role of an affair is to create emotional distance in the marriage."&lt;ref&gt;Moultrup, David ''Husbands, Wives &amp; Lovers: The Emotional System of the Extramarital Affair'' New York: Guilford Press 1990.  Moultrup also contributed to 'The Handbook of the Clinical Treatment of Infidelity' with editors Piercy, FP; Hertlein, KM and Wetchler, JL. Haworth.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; In this view, neither sexual intercourse nor physical affection is necessary to affect the committed relationship(s) of those involved in the affair. It is theorized that an emotional affair can injure a committed relationship more than a [[one night stand]] or other [[casual sex|casual sexual encounters]].&lt;ref&gt;Schutzwohl, Achim &amp; Koch, Stephanie "Sex differences in jealousy: The recall of cues to sexual and emotional fidelity in personally more and less threatening context conditions." Department of Psychology, University of Bielefeld, Germany 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Incidence and prevalence==
Research by Glass &amp; Wright found that men's extramarital relationships were more sexual and women's more emotional. For both genders, sexual and emotional extramarital involvement occurred in those with the greatest marital dissatisfaction.&lt;ref&gt;Glass &amp; Wright 'Sex differences in type of extramarital involvement and marital dissatisfaction Journal Sex Roles Publisher Springer Netherlands ISSN 0360-0025 (Print) 1573-2762 (Online) Issue Volume 12, Numbers 9-10 / May, 1985&lt;/ref&gt;

Chaste and emotionally intimate affairs tend to be more common than sexually intimate affairs. Shirley Glass reported in ''Not "Just Friends"'' that 44% of husbands and 57% of wives indicated that in their affair they had a strong emotional involvement to the other person without intercourse.&lt;ref&gt;Shirley Glass S 'Not Just Friends - protect your relationship from infidelity and heal the trauma of betrayal'&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[University of Chicago]] surveys conducted by the [[National Opinion Research Center]] (NORC)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.norc.org/homepage.htm |title=NORC at the University of Chicago - Insight for Informed Decisions - NORC.org |work=norc.org |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070307165624/http://www.norc.org/homepage.htm |archivedate=2007-03-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; between 1990 and 2002, 27% of people who reported being happy in marriage admitted to having an extramarital affair. The meaning and definition of what infidelity constitutes often varies depending on the person asked. Sexual feelings in an emotional affair are necessarily denied to maintain the illusion that it is just a special friendship. Affair surveys are unlikely to explore what is denied. Many people in affair surveys are not honest with themselves nor with the interviewer.&lt;ref&gt;Blow, Adrian J,  Hartnett, Kelley "INFIDELITY IN COMMITTED RELATIONSHIPS II: A SUBSTANTIVE REVIEW" Journal of Marital and Family Therapy'', April 2005, retrieved from [http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3658/is_200504/ai_n13641677]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Blow, Adrian J,  Hartnett, Kelley "INFIDELITY IN COMMITTED RELATIONSHIPS I: A METHODOLOGICAL REVIEW Journal of Marital and Family Therapy, April 2005, retrieved from [http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3658/is_200504/ai_n13641667]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Characteristics ==
This type of affair is often characterized by:
* '''Unexpected [[emotional intimacy]].''' The partner being unfaithful may spend inappropriate or excessive time with someone of the opposite or same gender (time not shared with the other partner). He or she may confide more in their new "friend" than in their partner and may share more intimate emotional feelings and secrets with their new partner than with their existing spouse. Any time that an individual invests more emotionally into a relationship with someone besides their partner the existing partnership may suffer.&lt;ref&gt;Jill Hubbard, ''The Secrets Women Keep'' (2008) p. 47-8&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Deception]] and secrecy.''' Those involved may not tell their partners about the amount of time they spend with each other. An individual involved in this type of affair may, for example, tell his or her spouse that they are doing other activities when they are really meeting with someone else. Or the unfaithful spouse may exclude any mention of the other person while discussing the day’s activities to conceal the rendezvous. Even if no physical intimacy occurs, the deception shows that those involved believe they are doing something wrong that undermines the existing relationship. In other words, if there was really no harm in meeting with a friend, both parties would feel comfortable telling their partners the truth about where they are meeting and what they are discussing.&lt;ref&gt;B. Schaeffer, ''Is it Love or is It Addiction'' (2013) p. 104&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Increased fighting.''' When a person becomes emotionally involved with someone and do not recognize it as a valid feeling, they may begin to channel their anger and disgust to diverse relationships, or to interpret different relationships [[Cognitive distortion|in a dichotomized manner]]. This person may also [[Defence mechanisms|rationalize a cause to something or someone]], which can lead to increased fighting and strain on the relationships.
* '''Sexual and emotional chemistry.''' Sexual and emotional chemistry can present itself based on a physical attraction one might feel for another person. In addition, it can also be related to an increase in [[dopamine]], a hormone that produces feelings of pleasure, and [[norepinephrine]], which is similar to adrenaline and causes an increase in excitement. This may or may not lead to physical intimacy, however, if nurtured it may present itself. The time between the first meeting and a first kiss can often be very lengthy, but the time between the first kiss and sexual intercourse may be very short. In most of these affairs, however, an unspoken attraction exists. A partner may spend extra time getting ready before seeing this "friend" or may buy new clothing or change their appearance to seem attractive to them. They may obsess anticipating phone calls, emails or text messages and there may be a decrease or stop in sexual activity with their spouse.
* '''Denial.''' Denial of the attraction and [[limerence]] felt may be exhibited by the cheating partner, but a similar denial and [[Minimisation (psychology)|minimisation]] may also be defensively deployed by the excluded partner as well, to avoid confrontation.&lt;ref&gt;R. T. &amp; P. S. Potter-Efron, ''The Emotional Affair'' (2008) p. 28 and p. 116&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural examples==
In ''[[Casanova's Chinese Restaurant]]'', the composer [[Hugh Moreland]], talking of an unlikely couple experiencing [[love at first sight]], denies that they are having an affair: "You can have a passion for someone without having an affair. That is one of the things no one seems able to understand these days...one of those fascinating mutual attractions between improbable people that take place from time to time.  I should like to write a ballet around it."&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Powell, ''Casanova's Chinese Restaurant'' (1980) p. 54&lt;/ref&gt;

==Therapy as subset==
The entrance of a therapist into a couple's dynamics may be problematic. It may be experienced by the non-client as the client-partner having an emotional affair with the therapist. This is someone granted a greater degree of intimacy and confiding than themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Diane Vaughan, ''Uncoupling'' (1987) p. 212&lt;/ref&gt; The tendency to create a mate-substitute out of the therapist may be especially acute in incest survivors.&lt;ref&gt;Sam Kirschner, ''Working with Adult Incest Survivors'' (1993) p. 129&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Fayan school''', or '''Fayan House''' ({{zh|c=法眼宗|p=Fǎyǎn Zōng}}) was one of the [[Five Houses of Chán]], the major schools of [[Chinese Chán]] during the later [[Tang Dynasty]].

==History==

===Origins===
The Fayan school was named after Chinese Zen Master [[Qingliang Wenyi]] (885–958).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mzb.com.cn/html/report/184602-1.htm |script-title=zh:"一切现成"法眼宗|publisher=|date=March 1, 2011|accessdate=August 9, 2012|language=Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Via [[Xuefeng Yicun]] the Fayang school and Yunmen school are traced back to [[Shitou Xiqian]] and [[Huineng]]. Xuefeng was one of the most influential Chán-teachers at the end of the Tang Dynasty,{{sfn|McRae|2003|p=13}} when "a widely influential zen center formed around [[Xuefeng Yicun]]".{{sfn|Dumoulin|2005-A|p=169}} The loss of control by the Tang Dynasty, and the accompanying loss of support for Buddhist institutions, lead to a regionally based Chan of Xuefeng and his students.{{sfn|Welter|2006|p=90}}

The ''[[Anthology of the Patriarchal Hall|Zutang ji]]'' (祖堂集 "Anthology of the Patriarchal Hall"), compiled in 952, the first document which mentions [[Linji Yixuan]], was written to support the Xuefeng Yicun lineage.{{sfn|Welter|year unknown-B}} It pictures this lineage as heir to the legacy of Mazu and the Hongzhou-school,{{sfn|Welter|year unknown-B}} though Xuefeng Yicun's lineage is traced back to [[Shitou Xiqian]] (700-790). It was written by two students of Zhaoqing Wendeng (884-972), a dharma descendant of [[Xuefeng Yicun]].

{{Zen lineage Fayan school and Yunmen school}}

===Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms Period (907–960/979)===
During the [[Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period]] the Fayan school became the dominant school in the southern kingdoms of Nan-T'ang ([[Jiangxi]], Chiang-hsi) and [[Wuyue]] (Che-chiang).{{sfn|Welter|2000|p=86-87}} It propagated ''chiao-ch'an i-chih'', "harmony between Ch'an and the Teaching", in opposition to ''chiao-wai pieh-ch'uan'', "a special transmission outside the teaching", the latter eventually becoming one of the defining slogans of Chán.{{sfn|Welter|2000|p=86-91}}

===Absorption into the Linji school===
Over the course of Song Dynasty (960–1279), the Fayan school, along with the [[Guiyang school|Guiyang]] and [[Yunmen school|Yunmen]] schools were gradually absorbed into the [[Linji school]].

[[File:Friendship bracelet diagram2.jpg|thumb|Step-by-step diagram of basic knot associated with friendship bracelets]]

A '''friendship bracelet''' is a decorative [[bracelet]] given by one person to another as a symbol of [[friendship]]. Friendship bracelets are often handmade, usually of [[embroidery floss]] or [[thread (yarn)|thread]] and are a type of  [[macrame]]. There are various styles and patterns, but most are based on the same simple [[half-hitch knot]].

The amount of thread used in bracelets varies depending on the pattern. The smallest pattern, a double chain knot, requires two strings while the candy stripe can have as 3 or more strings depending on the desired thickness.

Friendship bracelets first became popular in the [[United States]] during the 1970s. As they are unisex, they are commonly worn by both male and female [[Adolescence|teenagers]] and children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Buchanan |first=Andrea J. |title=The Daring Book for Girls |year=2007 |publisher=Collins |location=New York |isbn=0-06-147257-3 |author2=Miriam Peskowitz |page=99}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are now popular throughout the world&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Robinson|first=Russell|title=Weekend: Mums on a mission|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=lUBBAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=2agMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3899,4275950&amp;dq=friendship-bracelet&amp;hl=en|newspaper=Herald Sun|date=November 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Johnson|first=Dirk|title=Despite rain, Denver is a mile high for the Pope|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=aA0kAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=_tAFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6544,3852443&amp;dq=friendship-bracelet&amp;hl=en|newspaper=Moscow-Pullman Daily News|date=August 13, 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Glascock|first=Stuart|title=Dalai Lama draws 65,000 in Seattle|url=http://www.commondreams.org/archive/2008/04/13/8251|newspaper=Common Dreams|date=April 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are not only popular among teenagers but among the older generation; they are popular among celebrities as well. Friendship bracelets can be worn on various occasions; for example, they are ideal as a fashion accessory at the beach because they are made of materials that will not be easily destroyed and with which one can swim freely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Friendship Bracelets and Patterns |url=http://diamondsinstyle.com/blog/friendship-bracelet-patterns.html | work=diamondsinstyle.com |accessdate=27 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Friendship bracelets are ancient, but their resurgence is modern. The modern popularity of friendship bracelets started in the 1980s when they were seen during protests about the disappearances of [[Mayan people|Mayan]] Indians and peasants in Guatemala.&lt;ref name=Globe&gt;{{cite news|author=Julie Hatfield, Globe Staff|title= Bracelets that Make a Statement |newspaper= The Boston Globe |publisher= The New York Times Company|date= 1988|accessdate= August 27, 2012 |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-8063624.html Highbeam.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The friendship bracelets were brought into the United States by religious groups for use in political rallies.&lt;ref name=Globe /&gt; 

Friendship bracelets can have many meanings and symbolic uses, such as friendship, [[folk art]], or social statements.&lt;ref name=Globe /&gt; Although it is generally accepted that the origins of these colorful bands lie with the Indians in Central and South America, some decorative knots can be traced back to China from 481 to 221 B.C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=Braceletbook.com|url=http://www.braceletbook.com/history_of_friendship_bracelets.html|title=History of friendship bracelets}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to tradition, one ties a bracelet onto the wrist of a friend as a symbol of friendship and may wish for something at that moment. The bracelet should be worn until it is totally worn out and falls off by itself to honour the hard work and love put into making it. The moment at which the band falls off on its own, the wish is supposed to come true.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gryski |first=Camilla |author-link=Camilla Gryski |title=Friendship Bracelets |date= August 1993  |publisher=Mulberry Books |page=front inside cover |isbn=0688124372 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Misanga==
Misanga is an international good luck charm made from knotted [[Embroidery thread|embroidery floss]], [[thread (yarn)|thread]] or [[Gimp (thread)|gimp]]. Similar to friendship bracelets, it is made with basic knots as well as patterning techniques. Its basic structure is a three thread plaited braid. It is becoming a popular portable craft project.

==Patterns==

Pattern names vary slightly depending on location, but are overall similar.

The '''Great White Brotherhood''', in belief systems akin to [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]] and [[New Age]], are said to be perfected beings of great power who spread spiritual teachings through selected humans.&lt;ref name="barrett"&gt;{{cite book |title= Sects, 'Cults', and Alternative Religions: A World Survey and Sourcebook|last= Barrett|first= David|year= 1996|publisher= Blandford|location= London|isbn= 0-7137-2567-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The members of the Brotherhood may be known as the [[Masters of the Ancient Wisdom]] or the [[Ascended master|Ascended Masters]].&lt;ref name="barrett" /&gt;  The first person to talk about them in the West was [[Helena Petrovna Blavatsky]] (Theosophy), after she and other people claimed to have received messages from them.  These included [[Helena Roerich]], [[Aleister Crowley]], [[Alice A. Bailey]], [[Guy Ballard]], Geraldine Innocente ([[The Bridge to Freedom]]), [[Elizabeth Clare Prophet]] and [[Benjamin Creme]].&lt;ref name="barrett" /&gt;

==History==
The idea of a secret organization of enlightened mystics, guiding the spiritual development of the human race, was pioneered in the late eighteenth century by [[Karl von Eckartshausen]] (1752-1803) in his book ''[[The Cloud upon the Sanctuary]]''; Eckartshausen called this body of mystics, who remained active after their physical deaths on earth, the ''Council of Light''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl von Eckartshausen|von Eckartshausen, K.]], ''[[The Cloud upon the Sanctuary]]'' (Isabelle de Steiger, translator).  (Weiser: 2003.  {{ISBN|0-89254-084-2}})&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adepti.com/docs/eck.pdf ''The Cloud on the Sanctuary''] ([[PDF]] etext; accessed Dec. 14, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; Eckartshausen's proposed communion of living and dead mystics, in turn, drew partially on Christian ideas such as the [[Communion of Saints|Communion of the Saints]], and partially on previously circulating European ideas about [[secret society|secret societies]] of enlightened, [[mysticism|mystical]], or [[magic (paranormal)|magic]] adepts typified by the [[Rosicrucian]]s and the [[Illuminati]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Joscelyn Godwin|Godwin, J]]. ''The Theosophical Enlightenment'' (Albany: State University of New York Press, 1994), ch. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Mahatma Letters]]'' began publication in 1881 with information purportedly revealed by "[[Koot Hoomi]]" to [[Alfred Percy Sinnett]], and were also influential on the early development of the tradition. Koot Hoomi, through Sinnett, revealed that high-ranking members of mystic organizations in [[India]] and [[Tibet]] were able to maintain regular [[telepathy|telepathic]] contact with one another, and thus were able to communicate to each other, and also to Sinnett, without the need for either written or oral communications, and in a manner similar to the way that [[spirit medium]]s claimed to communicate with the spirits of the dead. The letters published by Sinnett, which proposed the controversial doctrine of [[reincarnation]], were said to have been revealed through this means.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joscelyn Godwin|Godwin, J.]] ''The Theosophical Enlightenment'' (Albany: State University of New York Press, 1994), ch. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

Eckartshausen's idea was expanded in the teachings of [[Helena P. Blavatsky]] as developed by [[Charles W. Leadbeater]], [[Alice Bailey]] and [[Helena Roerich]]. Blavatsky, founder of the [[Theosophical Society]], attributed her teachings to just such a body of adepts; in her 1877 book ''[[Isis Unveiled]]'', she called the revealers of her teachings the "Masters of the Hidden Brotherhood" or the "[[Mahatma]]s". Blavatsky claimed that she had made physical contact with these adepts' earthly representatives in Tibet; but also, that she continued to receive teachings from them through psychic channels, through her abilities of spirit mediumship.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ronald Hutton|Hutton, R.]] ''The Triumph of the Moon: A History of Modern Pagan Witchcraft'' (Oxford, 2000; {{ISBN|0-19-820744-1}}), p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

Ideas about this secret council of sages, under several names, were a widely shared feature of late nineteenth century and early twentieth century [[esotericism]]. [[Arthur Edward Waite]], in his 1898 ''Book of Black Magic and of Pacts'', hinted at the existence of a secret group of initiates who dispense truth and wisdom to the worthy.&lt;ref&gt;[[Arthur Edward Waite]], ''[http://www.sacred-texts.com/grim/bcm/bcm80.htm The Book of Ceremonial Magic]'' (first edition title: ''The Book of Black Magic and of Pacts''), conclusion.  (London, 1913)&lt;/ref&gt; A young [[Aleister Crowley]], reading this, wrote Waite and was directed to read von Eckartshausen's book. Crowley's search for this secret wisdom eventually led him to become a neophyte in the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]], which represented itself to be the visible and earthly outer order of the Great White Brotherhood.&lt;ref&gt;[[Aleister Crowley]] ([[John Symonds|Symonds, John]] and [[Kenneth Grant|Grant, Kenneth]], eds.), ''[[The Confessions of Aleister Crowley]]'' (Bantam, 1971), pp. xiv-xv (Symonds introduction)&lt;/ref&gt; Within the Golden Dawn itself, its teachings claimed to be derived from a similar body of initiates which in that tradition were called the [[Secret Chiefs]].&lt;ref&gt;Crowley, supra, p. 347 ''et passim''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The actual phrase "Great White Brotherhood" was used extensively in Leadbeater's 1925 book ''The Masters and the Path''.&lt;ref&gt;[[C. W. Leadbeater|Leadbeater, C. W.]], ''The Masters and the Path'' (Theosophical Publishing House, 1925; expanded, 1927)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alice A. Bailey]] also claimed to have received numerous revelations from the Great White Brotherhood between 1920 and 1949, which are compiled in her books known collectively by her followers as the ''[[Alice Bailey#Bibliography|Alice A. Bailey Material]].'' Since the introduction of the phrase, the term "Great White Brotherhood" is in some circles used generically to refer to any concept of an enlightened community of adepts, on earth or in the hereafter, with benevolent aims toward the spiritual development of the human race, and without strict regard to the names used within the tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Crowley, supra.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dion Fortune]] adopts the name to refer to the community of living and dead adepts.&lt;ref&gt;See generally, [[Dion Fortune|Fortune, Dion]], ''The Training and Work of an Initiate'' (1930; rev. ed. Weiser, 2000; {{ISBN|1-57863-183-1}}) and ''The Esoteric Orders and their Work'' (1928).&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[ritual magic]]ians of the [[Western mystery tradition]] sometimes refer to the Great White Brotherhood as the "Great White Lodge", a name that appears to indicate that they imagine it constitutes an [[initiation|initiatory]] [[hierarchy]] similar to [[Freemasonry]]. [[Gareth Knight]] describes its members as the "Masters" or "Inner Plane Adepti", who have "gained all the experience, and all the wisdom resulting from experience, necessary for their spiritual evolution in the worlds of form." While some go on to "higher evolution in other spheres", others become teaching Masters who stay behind to help younger initiates in their "cyclic evolution on this planet". Only a few of this community are known to the human race; these initiates are the "teaching Masters."&lt;ref&gt;[[Gareth Knight|Knight, G]], ''A Practical Guide to Qabalistic Symbolism'' (1965; repr. Weiser, 1978; {{ISBN|0-87728-397-4}}), v. 1 ch. X "Chesed", ss. 14-16.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[AMORC]] Rosicrucian order maintains a difference between the "Great White Brotherhood" and the "Great White Lodge", saying that the Great White Brotherhood is the "school or fraternity" of the Great White Lodge, and that "every true student on the Path" aspires to membership in this Brotherhood.&lt;ref&gt;[[H. Spencer Lewis|Lewis, H. S.]], ''Rosicrucian Manual'' (AMORC, 1938), pp. 139-140.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of Aleister Crowley's remarks appear to indicate that Crowley identified the Great White Brotherhood with the [[A∴A∴]], his magical secret society.&lt;ref&gt;[[Aleister Crowley|Crowley, A.]] ''[http://www.hermetic.com/crowley/aba/app2.html Liber ABA]'', book 4. part 3, appendix II; a/k/a ''Magick in Theory and Practice'' (Sangreal, 1969).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bulgaria]]n [[Gnostic]] master [[Peter Deunov]] referred to his organization of followers as the [[Universal White Brotherhood]], and it is clear that he too was referring to the [[Western mystery tradition|Western esoteric community-at-large]]. When ex-communicated as a heretic on 7 July 1922, he defended the Brotherhood as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
 ‘Let the [[Bulgarian Orthodox Church|Orthodox Church]] resolve this issue, whether Christ has risen, whether Love is accepted in the Orthodox Church. There is one church in the world. But the Universal White Brotherhood is outside the church - it is higher than the church. But even higher than the Universal White Brotherhood is the Kingdom of Heaven. Hence the Church is the first step, the Universal White Brotherhood is the second step, and the [[Kingdom of God|Kingdom of Heaven]] is the third step - the greatest one that is to be manifested.’ (24 June 1923).
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Similarly, [[Bulgaria]]n teacher [[Omraam Mikhaël Aïvanhov]] ([[Deunov]]'s principal disciple) formally established [[Fraternité Blanche Universelle]] as an "exoteric" esoteric organization still operating today in Switzerland, Canada, the USA, the UK and parts of Scandinavia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fbu.org/site_anglais/general_english/oma.htm |title=Omraam Mikhaël Aïvanhov |publisher=Fbu.org |date= |accessdate=2009-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''Great White Brotherhood'' was further developed and popularized in 1934 with the publication of "Unveiled Mysteries"&lt;ref&gt;King, Godfre Ray. ''Unveiled Mysteries''. Chicago, Illinois: Saint Germain Press 1934&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Guy Ballard|Guy Ballard's]] [["I AM" Activity]].&lt;ref&gt;Saint Germain Foundation. ''The History of the "I AM" Activity and Saint Germain Foundation''. Schaumburg, Illinois: Saint Germain Press 2003&lt;/ref&gt; This Brotherhood of "Immortal Saints and Sages"&lt;ref&gt;Vyasa, Krishna-Dwaipayana. [http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/maha/index.htm Mahabharata]. Chapter 23 - Arjuna's Quest: Indra addresses Arjuna saying: "This area is the abode of Immortal Saints and Sages. War and war-weapons are just unknown here."&lt;/ref&gt; who have gone through the Initiations of the Transfiguration, Resurrection, and the Ascension&lt;ref&gt;Besant, Annie. London: Theosophical Publishing House 1912&lt;/ref&gt; was further popularized by [[Ascended Master Teachings]] developed by [[The Bridge to Freedom]], [[The Summit Lighthouse]] and the [[Church Universal and Triumphant]], and The Temple of The Presence.

[[Benjamin Creme]] has published books—he claims the information within them has been telepathically transmitted to him from the Great White Brotherhood.

==Founding of the Great White Brotherhood==
In 1952, [[Geraldine Innocente]], messenger for ''The Bridge to Freedom'', delivered this address purported to be from [[Sanat Kumara]] describing the founding of the "Great White Brotherhood":

:" . . . I had nothing to work with but Light and Love, and many centuries passed before even two lifestreams applied for membership - One, later became Buddha (now, Lord of the World, the Planetary Logos [[Gautama Buddha]]) and the Other, became the Cosmic Christ (Lord [[Maitreya (Theosophy)|Maitreya]], now the Planetary Buddha). The Brotherhood has grown through these ages and centuries until almost all the offices are held now by those belonging to the evolution of Earth and those who have volunteered to remain among her evolution. . .."&lt;ref&gt;''The Bridge to Freedom Journal'' November 1953 (Reprinted by Ascended Master Teaching Foundation).&lt;/ref&gt;

Members of [[The Bridge to Freedom]] believe that on July 4, 1954 [[Sanat Kumara]] stated through Geraldine Innocente:

:" . . . Thus We took Our abode upon the sweet Earth. Through the same power of centripetal and centrifugal force of which I spoke (cohesion and expansion of the magnetic power of Divine Love), We then began to magnetize the Flame in the hearts of some of the Guardian Spirits who were not sleeping so soundly and who were not too enthusiastically engaged in using primal life for the satisfaction of the personal self.
 
:"In this way, the Great White Brotherhood began. The Three-fold Flame within the heart of [[Shamballa]], within the Hearts of the Kumaras and Myself, formed the magnetic Heart of the Great White Brotherhood by Whom you have all been blessed and of which Brotherhood you all aspire to become conscious members. . . . "&lt;ref&gt;''The Bridge to Freedom Journal'' November 1955 (Reprinted by Ascended Master Teaching Foundation).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Great Brotherhood of Light==
The Great White Brotherhood, also known as Great Brotherhood of Light or the Spiritual Hierarchy of Earth, is perceived as a spiritual organization composed of those [[Ascended master|Ascended Masters]] who have risen from the Earth into immortality, but still maintain an active watch over the world.&lt;ref&gt;Blavatsky, H. P. ''Isis Unveiled'' Volume 2 page 100:  ". . . the Secret Association is still alive and as active as ever"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roerich, Nicholas and Helena ''Hierarchy'' Agni Yoga Society, Inc. 1931 (reprinted 1977): "Certainly, when the black lodge directs its arrows against the White Brotherhood, the consequences are self-destructive, and the manifestation of a rebounding blow is unavoidable. What you heard is a consequence of self-destruction, because the aimed arrow returned to the sender."&lt;/ref&gt; C.W. Leadbeater said "The Great White Brotherhood also includes members of the Heavenly Host (the [[Spiritual Hierarchy]] directly concerned with the evolution of our world), [[Spiritual Hierarchy#Cosmic beings on Venus|Beneficent Members from other planets]] that are interested in our welfare, as well as certain unascended [[Apprenticeship|chelas]]".&lt;ref&gt;Leadbeater, C.W. ''The Masters and the Path''. Adyar, India: Theosophical Publishing House 1925 (Reprint: Kessinger Publishing 1997).&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Masters of the Ancient Wisdom]] are believed by Theosophists to be joined together in service to the Earth under the name of the Great White Brotherhood. The use of the term "white" refers to their use of white magic, as opposed to black, and is unrelated to race. The later versions of Blavatsky described the masters as&lt;ref&gt;Sinnett, Alfred Percy. ''[[s:The Occult World/Occultism and Its Adepts#Page 24|The Occult World]]''. Boston: Colby &amp; Rich, 1882.&lt;/ref&gt; ethnically [[Tibetan people|Tibetan]] or [[India]]n ([[Hindu]]), not [[European ethnic groups|European]]. Recent skeptical research indicates, however, that this description was used by Blavatsky to hide the real identity of her teachers, some of whom are said to have really been well known Indian rulers or personalities of her time.&lt;ref&gt;K. Paul Johnson: The Masters Revealed. Madame Blavatsky and the myth of the Great White Lodge. Albany, NY 1994: SUNY press&lt;/ref&gt;

Most occult groups assign a high level of importance to the Great White Brotherhood, but some make interaction with the Ascended Masters of the Brotherhood a major focus of their existence. Of these several, the most prominent are the [["I Am" Activity]], founded in the 1930s, The Bridge to Freedom, the [[Church Universal and Triumphant]], and The Temple of The Presence.&lt;ref&gt;''White Paper - Wesak World Congress 2002''. Acropolis Sophia Books &amp; Works 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Belief in the Brotherhood and the Masters is an essential part of the [[syncretism|syncretistic]] teachings of various organizations that have continued and expanded the Theosophical philosophical concepts.&lt;ref&gt;''I AM Ascended Master Dictation List'' Saint Germain Press Inc., 1995, Listing of those who are claimed to be Ascended Masters by The I AM Activity&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schroeder, Werner ''Ascended Masters and Their Retreats'' Ascended Master Teaching Foundation 2004, Listing of those who are believed to be Ascended Masters by The I AM Activity and The Bridge to Freedom&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Luk, A.D.K.. ''Law of Life - Book II''. Pueblo, Colorado: A.D.K. Luk Publications 1989, Listing of those who are claimed to be Ascended Masters by The I AM Activity and The Bridge to Freedom&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Booth, Annice ''The Masters and Their Retreats '' Summit Lighthouse Library June 2003, Listing of those who are believed to be Ascended Masters by The I AM Activity, The Bridge to Freedom, and The Summit Lighthouse&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shearer, Monroe &amp; Carolyn ''I AM Adorations, Affirmations &amp; Rhythmic Decrees'' Acropolis Sophia Books and Works 1998, Listing of those who are claimed to be Ascended Masters by The I AM Activity, The Bridge to Freedom, The Summit Lighthouse, and The Temple of The Presence&lt;/ref&gt; Information given by the Summit Lighthouse and the I AM movement is suspect, since none of the writers of these groups are Masters of any Brotherhood. Examples of those believed to be Ascended Masters would be, according to different unconfirmed sources are the [[Master Jesus]], [[Confucius]], [[Gautama Buddha]], [[Mary the Mother of Jesus]], [[Master Hilarion|Hilarion]], [[Enoch (ancestor of Noah)|Enoch]], [[Paul the Venetian]], [[Kuan Yin|Kwan Yin]], [[Comte de Saint-Germain|Saint Germain]], and [[Kuthumi]]. These sources say that all these peoples put aside any differences they might have had in their Earthly careers, and unite instead to advance the spiritual well-being of humanity.&lt;ref&gt;Sinnett, Alfred Percy. ''[[s:The Occult World/Recent Occult Phenomena#Page 95|The Occult World]]''. Boston: Colby &amp; Rich, 1882.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Agni Yoga==

The Great White Brotherhood is the name given in some metaphysical/occult circles to adepts of wisdom in or out of earthly incarnation who have assumed responsibility for the cosmic destiny of the human race, both individually and collectively. [[Nicholas Roerich]] and his wife, [[Helena Roerich]], inspired by the [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophical]] writings of [[H.P. Blavatsky]], published the "[[Agni Yoga]]" series of books. Their contents, claimed to be inspired by the Master [[Morya (Theosophy)|Morya]], described the work of the White Brotherhood and the Spiritual Hierarchy.

'''Homosexual agenda''' (or '''gay agenda''') is a term introduced by sectors of the [[Christian right|Christian religious right]] (primarily [[Social conservatism in the United States|in the United States]]) as a disparaging way to describe the [[LGBT social movements|advocacy of cultural acceptance and normalization]] of [[non-heterosexual]] [[Sexual orientation|orientations]] and relationships. The term refers to efforts to change government policies and laws on [[LGBT rights]]-related issues. Additionally, it has been used by social conservatives and others to describe alleged goals of LGBT rights activists, such as [[homosexual recruitment|recruiting heterosexuals]] into what they term a "[[homosexual lifestyle]]".&lt;ref name="thinkprogress.org"&gt;[http://thinkprogress.org/lgbt/2012/07/09/512916/hate-group-homosexual-activists-try-to-confuse-children-to-build-their-numbers/ Hate Group: 'Homosexual Activists' Try To 'Confuse Children' To 'Build Their Numbers'] ''[[Think Progress]]'' July 9, 2012.

== Origins and usage of the term "gay agenda" ==
[[File:Gaymarchwash.jpg|thumb|Cover of DVD ''The Gay Agenda: March on Washington'']]

===Early usage===
In the [[United States]], the phrase "the gay agenda" was popularized by a video series produced by the evangelical religious group, Springs of Life Ministries in California, and distributed by many [[Christian Right]] organizations, the first video of which was called ''The Gay Agenda'' and was released in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Herman|first=Didi|title=The Anti-Gay Agenda:  Orthodox Vision and the Christian Right|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year= 1997 (ebook, 2007)|isbn=9780226327693|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|81-81}}  In the same year the [[Oregon Citizens Alliance]] (a conservative Christian political activist organization) used this video as part of their campaign for [[Oregon Ballot Measure 9 (1992)|Ballot Measure 9]] to amend the Oregon Constitution to prevent what the OCA called [[special rights]] for gays, [[lesbian]]s, and [[bisexual]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Signorile|first=Michelangelo|year=1993|title=Queer In America|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Paul Cameron]]—co-founder of the Institute for the Scientific Investigation of Sexuality in Lincoln, later renamed the [[Family Research Institute]]—appeared in the video, wherein he asserted that 75 percent of gay men regularly ingest [[feces]] and that 70–78 percent have had a [[sexually transmitted disease]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Herman|1998|p=78}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Gay Agenda'' was followed by three other video publications; ''The Gay Agenda in Public Education'' (1993), ''The Gay Agenda: March on Washington'' (1993) and a feature follow-up ''Stonewall: 25 Years of Deception'' (1994). The videos contained interviews with [[LGBT rights opposition|opponents of LGBT rights]], and the series was made available through [[Christian right]] organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Herman|1998|pp=80–81}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of a ''homosexual agenda'' is also used by some Christian critics of LGBT rights in conjunction with a putative ideology they refer to as ''homosexualism'' (as opposed to a synonym for homosexuality), using ''homosexualists'' to describe people who seek to advance LGBT emancipation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sg.christianpost.com/dbase/editorial/330/7%7c15/1.htm|title=''Understanding the Homosexual Agenda'', The Christian Post, Sept 23 2008|publisher=|accessdate=10 May 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120317005543/http://sg.christianpost.com/dbase/editorial/330/7%7C15/1.htm|archive-date=17 March 2012|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anglican-mainstream.net/?p=14100|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090904122311/http://www.anglican-mainstream.net/?p=14100|dead-url=yes|archive-date=4 September 2009|title=''Obama Renews His Commitment to the Full Homosexualist Agenda'', Anglican Mainstream, August 18 2009|publisher=|accessdate=10 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The use of ''homosexualist'' in this way first appeared in 1995 in Scott Lively and Kevin Abrams' book ''[[The Pink Swastika]]'', "to refer to any person, homosexual or not, who actively promotes homosexuality as morally and socially equivalent to heterosexuality as a basis for social policy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mega.nu:8080/ampp/pinkswastika.hold/book.html|title=''The Pink Swastika'', "A Word to the Reader", Scott Lively and Kevin Abrams, 3rd edition, 1998|publisher=|accessdate=10 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lively and Abrahams argue that alleged homosexuality found in the Nazi Party, specifically within [[Ernst Röhm]]'s [[Sturmabteilung|SA]], contributed to the extreme militarism of Nazi Germany, and write about the "gay agenda" in this context.

===Contemporary usage and meaning===
The term is applied to efforts to change government policies and laws on [[lesbian]], [[gay]], [[bisexual]], and [[transgender]] ([[LGBT]]) issues, for example, [[same-sex marriage]] and [[civil unions]], [[LGBT adoption]], recognizing [[Suspect classification|sexual orientation as a protected civil rights minority classification]], [[Sexual orientation and military service|LGBT military participation]], inclusion of [[LGBT history]] and themes in [[public education]], introduction of [[anti-bullying legislation]] to protect LGBT minors—as well as non-governmental campaigns and individual actions that increase visibility and cultural acceptance of LGBT people, relationships, and identities. The term has also been used by some [[social conservatism in the United States|social conservatives]] to describe alleged goals of [[LGBT rights]] activists, such as supposed [[homosexual recruitment|recruitment]] of heterosexuals into a "homosexual lifestyle".&lt;ref name="thinkprogress.org"/&gt;

A 1987 essay titled "The Overhauling of Straight America", by [[Marshall Kirk]] and Hunter Madsen (writing as Erastes Pill),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper |title=The Overhauling of Straight America |url=http://library.gayhomeland.org/0018/EN/EN_Overhauling_Straight.htm |author=Kirk, Marshall and Pill, Erastes (pseud.) |date=1987 |publisher=Guide Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; lays out a six-point plan for a campaign, which was first published in ''Guide'' magazine. They argued that gays must portray themselves in a positive way to straight America, and that the main aim of making homosexuality acceptable could be achieved by getting Americans "to think that it is just another thing, with a shrug of their shoulders". Then "your battle for legal and social rights is virtually won". The pair developed their argument in the 1989 book ''After the Ball: How America Will Conquer Its Fear and Hatred of Gays in the '90s''.  The book outlined a public relations strategy for the LGBT movement. It argues that after the [[gay liberation]] phase of the 1970s and 1980s, gay rights groups should adopt more professional public relations techniques to convey their message. After its publication Kirk appeared in the pages of ''Newsweek'', ''Time'' and ''The Washington Post''. The book is often critically described by social conservatives such as [[Focus on the Family]] as important to the success of the LGBT Movement in the '90s and as part of an alleged "homosexual agenda".&lt;ref name="osten"&gt;{{Citation|last=Osten|first=Craig|title=Q&amp;A: The Homosexual Agenda |publisher=CitizenLink, affiliate of [[Focus on the Family]] |year=2003 |url=http://www.citizenlink.org/CLFeatures/A000000562.cfm |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080612003916/http://www.citizenlink.org/CLFeatures/A000000562.cfm |archivedate=2008-06-12 |accessdate=2011-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Satire ===
A [[satire|satirical]] article by Michael Swift which appeared in the ''[[Gay Community News (Boston)|Gay Community News]]'' in February 1987 entitled "Gay Revolutionary" describes a scenario in which homosexual men dominate [[American society]] and suppress all things heterosexual. This was reprinted in ''[[Congressional Record]]'' without the opening line: "This essay is an outré, madness, a tragic, cruel fantasy, an eruption of inner rage, on how the oppressed desperately dream of being the oppressor."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/pwh/swift1.html|title=Fordham University:  Michael Swift – Gay Revolutionary (the complete essay)|publisher=|accessdate=10 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is sometimes used satirically as a counterfoil by people who would normally find this term offensive, such as the spoof agenda found on the [[Betty Bowers]] satirical website,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bettybowers.com/homoagenda.html|title=This website is currently unavailable.|website=www.bettybowers.com|accessdate=10 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and when Bishop [[Gene Robinson]] declared that "Jesus is the agenda, the homosexual agenda in the Episcopal Church".&lt;ref&gt;Bishop Gene Robinson, "[http://www.beliefnet.com/News/2006/06/Jesus-Is-The-Homosexual-Agenda.aspx?p=2 Jesus is the Homosexual Agenda]", address to the General Convention of the Episcopal Church in the United States of America, June 14, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[https://web.archive.org/web/20080717075629/http://www.episcopalchurch.org/79901_98902_ENG_HTM.htm  Church need not be afraid, New Hampshire bishop tells Putney gathering]", ''Episcopal Life'', July 13, 2008.

The '''Jade Helm 15 conspiracy theories''' were based on the Jade Helm 15 United States [[military exercise|military training exercise]] which took place in multiple U.S. states in the summer of 2015, starting on July 15 and ending on September 15. The announcements of these training exercises raised concerns and led to speculative interpretations that were characterized by ''[[The New York Times]]'' as "travers[ing] the outer edges of political paranoia".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/07/us/conspiracy-theories-over-jade-helm-get-some-traction-in-texas.html|title=Conspiracy Theories Over Jade Helm Training Exercise Get Some Traction in Texas|work=The New York Times|author=Manny Fernandez|date=May 6, 2015|accessdate=May 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9178">'''Jiang Gongfu''' ({{zh|姜公輔}}, [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] : ''Khương Công Phụ'' ; 731 – 805) was an official of the [[History of China|Chinese]] [[Tang Dynasty]] who served as a [[chancellor of Tang Dynasty|chancellor]] during the reign of [[Emperor Dezong of Tang|Emperor Dezong]].
__TOC__

==Biography==
It is not known when Jiang Gongfu was born, but it is known that his family was from Ai Prefecture (愛州, in modern [[Thanh Hóa Province]], [[Vietnam]]),&lt;ref&gt;''[[New Book of Tang]]'', [http://www.sidneyluo.net/a/a17/152.htm vol. 152].&lt;/ref&gt; although the family claimed to be originally from [[Tianshui]]. Jiang Gongfu's grandfather Jiang Shenyi (姜神翊) served as a prefectural prefect, but his father Jiang Ting (姜挺) was not listed with any official titles. He had at least one younger brother, Jiang Fu (姜復).&lt;ref&gt;''New Book of Tang'', vol. 73.{{cite web|url=http://www.sidneyluo.net/a/a17/073.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-04-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090202171923/http://sidneyluo.net/a/a17/073.htm |archivedate=2009-02-02 |df= }} [http://www.sidneyluo.net/a/a17/table/form71.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

After Jiang Gongfu passed the [[imperial examination]]s he was made ''Xiaoshulang'' (校書郎), an editor at the [[Palace Library]]. After he passed a special examination on policy proposals, he was made ''Zuo Shiyi'' (左拾遺), an advisor at the examination bureau of government (門下省, ''Menxia Sheng''), and he was also made an imperial scholar at Hanlin Pavilion (翰林館). After more than a year, when he was to be given a different office, he submitted a petition, citing the poverty of his household and the agedness of his mother, requesting to be also made the census officer under the mayor of Jingzhao Municipality (京兆, i.e., the region of the capital [[Chang'an]]), because the census officer, while a low-level position, had a high salary, and his petition was granted. He was said to be capable and sensible, and whenever he met [[Emperor Dezong of Tang|Emperor Dezong]] to make suggestions, Emperor Dezong often followed his suggestions.&lt;ref name=BT138&gt;''[[Old Book of Tang]]'', [http://www.sidneyluo.net/a/a16/138.htm vol. 138] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080621210544/http://www.sidneyluo.net/a/a16/138.htm |date=2008-06-21 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 783, with Emperor Dezong waging wars against several warlords in the east, the soldiers from Jingyuan Circuit (涇原, headquartered in modern [[Pingliang]], [[Gansu]]), were at Chang'an to await deployment to the east. They were angered that they were not given rewards that they felt they deserved, and they mutinied. Emperor Dezong sent his son Li Yi (李誼) the Prince of Pu&lt;ref&gt;Li Yi was actually Emperor Dezong's nephew — the son of Emperor Dezong's brother Li Miao (李邈), but was adopted by Emperor Dezong at the directions of Emperor Dezong. See ''Old Book of Tang'', [http://www.sidneyluo.net/a/a16/150.htm vol. 150] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080621210610/http://www.sidneyluo.net/a/a16/150.htm |date=2008-06-21 }} and ''[[Zizhi Tongjian]]'', [[:zh:s:資治通鑑/卷233|vol. 233]].&lt;/ref&gt; and Jiang to try to calm the soldiers, but the soldiers merely got angrier, and Emperor Dezong, in panic, decided to flee Chang'an. As he was ready to do so, Jiang tried to warn him about the dangers of leaving the senior general [[Zhu Ci]] in the city – as Emperor Dezong had removed Zhu Ci from his command in 782 due to his brother [[Zhu Tao]]'s rebelling against imperial authority&lt;ref&gt;''Zizhi Tongjian'', [[:zh:s:資治通鑑/卷227|vol. 227]].&lt;/ref&gt; – and had served as the military governor (''[[Jiedushi]]'') of Jingyuan Circuit before, and therefore might receive the Jingyuan soldiers' support. He suggested to Emperor Dezong that either he should kill Zhu Ci before leaving or ask Zhu to accompany him. Emperor Dezong, in panic, could not carry out either action, and left Zhu in the city. Emperor Dezong fled to Fengtian (奉天, in modern [[Xianyang]], [[Shaanxi]]), and Jiang followed him there.&lt;ref name=ZZTJ228&gt;''Zizhi Tongjian'', [[:zh:s:資治通鑑/卷228|vol. 228]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Emperor Dezong issued emergency edicts seeking aid from the nearby circuits. Meanwhile, the Jingyuan soldiers did as Jiang predicted and supported Zhu as their leader. Zhu initially claimed that he was merely calming the situation at Chang'an and was ready to welcome Emperor Dezong back to Chang'an, but soon there were rumors that Zhu was planning to claim imperial title himself and attack Emperor Dezong at Fengtian. In light of this, some officials who had fled to Fengtian suggested that Fengtian's defenses be shored up, but the [[chancellor of Tang Dynasty|chancellor]] [[Lu Qi (Tang dynasty)|Lu Qi]], misjudging the situation, argued to Emperor Dezong that Zhu would surely remain faithful to Tang and advocated taking no precautions at all and stopping the incoming aid troops. It was only at Jiang's advice Emperor Dezong continued to receive the aid troops into Fengtian. At suggestion of Lu and Bai Zhizhen (白志貞) the commander of the imperial guards, Emperor Dezong sent his granduncle Wu Xu (吳漵) to Chang'an to communicate with Zhu. Zhu initially welcomed Wu as an honored imperial emissary, but soon put Wu to death. He declared himself emperor of a new state of Qin. He put Fengtian under siege, and during the siege, Emperor Dezong made Jiang ''Jianyi Daifu'' (諫議大夫), a high-level advisor at the examination bureau, and gave him the designation ''Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi'' (同中書門下平章事), making him a chancellor ''de facto''.&lt;ref name=ZZTJ228/&gt;

==During chancellorship==
In 784, because the general [[Li Huaiguang]] also rebelled, Emperor Dezong fled further to Liang Prefecture (梁州, in modern [[Hanzhong]], [[Shaanxi]]), and Jiang Gongfu accompanied him. On the way to Liang Prefecture, Emperor Dezong's oldest daughter Princess Tang'an died at Chenggu (城固, in modern Hanzhong). After Emperor Dezong reached Liang Prefecture, he wanted to build a [[pagoda]] for Princess Tang'an and bury her with great wealth.&lt;ref name=ZZTJ230&gt;''Zizhi Tongjian'', [[:zh:s:資治通鑑/卷230|vol. 230]].&lt;/ref&gt; Jiang submitted a petition stating:&lt;ref name=BT138/&gt;

{{quote|Soon, the capital will be recaptured, and the princess will be able to be reburied properly. We are now on the road, and we need to be frugal and use the money on the soldiers.}}

Emperor Dezong became angry and wanted to remove Jiang. Despite the intercession of Emperor Dezong's trusted advisor [[Lu Zhi (Tang Dynasty)|Lu Zhi]], Emperor Dezong soon removed Jiang and made him a member of the staff of his [[crown prince]] [[Emperor Shunzong of Tang|Li Song]].&lt;ref name=ZZTJ230/&gt;

==After chancellorship==
Jiang Gongfu's mother soon died, and he left governmental service to observe a period of mourning for her. After the period of mourning, he was returned to Li Song's staff, but went a long time without being promoted.&lt;ref name=BT138/&gt; By 792, Lu Zhi was a chancellor. Because he and Lu Zhi were colleagues while they were imperial scholars, Jiang met Lu to request his help. Lu secretly responded:&lt;ref name=ZZTJ234&gt;''Zizhi Tongjian'', [[:zh:s:資治通鑑/卷234|vol. 234]].&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|I had heard that Chancellor Dou [(i.e., [[Dou Can]], who had recently been removed and exiled by Emperor Dezong)] had recommended you a number of times. The Emperor refused, and had a number of angry words about you.}}

In fear, Jiang offered to resign and asked to become a [[Taoist]] [[monk]]. When Emperor Dezong inquired as to the reason and found out that he was fearful, he did not dare to state that Lu had told him this information, and instead claimed that Dou told him the information. Angry that his words had been leaked, Emperor Dezong demoted Jiang to be the secretary general of Quan Prefecture (泉州, in modern [[Quanzhou]], [[Fujian]]), and sent imperial [[Eunuch (court official)|eunuch]] messengers to Dou, in exile, to rebuke him. After Emperor Dezong died in 805 and was succeeded by Li Song (as Emperor Shunzong), Jiang was slightly promoted, to be the prefect of Ji Prefecture (吉州, in modern [[Ji'an]], [[Jiangxi]]). He soon died, and was posthumously honored by Emperor Shunzong's son and successor [[Emperor Xianzong of Tang|Emperor Xianzong]] (to whom Emperor Shunzong, then seriously ill, passed the throne to in 805 as well).&lt;ref name=BT138/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Zizhi Tongjian'', [[:zh:s:資治通鑑/卷236|vol. 236]].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Friggieri was the first professor of philosophy on the University of Malta faculty not to be a Catholic priest and succeeded [[Peter Serracino Inglott]] in 1996 upon the latter's retirement.

He has won several literary awards, including the National Literary Prize three times (1993, 1999 and 2003).  One of his most popular works is ''L-Istejjer tar-Ronnie'', published in 1994 by Klabb Kotba Maltin, which caricatures father of four ir-Ronnie, a Maltese middle-aged mechanic, in a series of short stories.  The original publication was so popular that it was eventually turned into a teleserial.&lt;ref&gt;Stagno, Guze.

In [[Hindu mythology]], a '''kinnara''' is a [[paradigm]]atic lover, a celestial musician, [[Centaur|half-human and half-horse]] (India). In South-east Asia,  two of the most beloved mythological characters are the benevolent half-human, half-bird creatures known as the Kinnara and Kinnari, which are believed to come from the Himalayas and often watch over the well-being of humans in times of trouble or danger. Their character is clarified in the Adi parva of the [[Mahabharata]], where they say:

:We are everlasting lover and beloved.  We never separate.  We are 	eternally husband and wife; never do we become mother and father. 	No offspring is seen in our lap.  We are lover and beloved 	ever-embracing.  In between us we do not permit any third creature 	demanding affection.  Our life is a life of perpetual pleasure.&lt;ref&gt;

}} p.&amp;nbsp;71&lt;/ref&gt;
They are also featured in a number of Buddhist texts, including the [[Lotus Sutra]].
An ancient Indian string instrument is known as the Kinnari [[Veena]].

In [[Southeast Asian]] mythology, '''Kinnaris''', the female counterpart of Kinnaras, are depicted as half-bird, half-woman creatures. One of the many creatures that inhabit the mythical [[Himavanta]], Kinnaris have the head, torso, and arms of a woman and the wings, tail and feet of a swan. They are renowned for their dance, song and poetry, and are a traditional symbol of feminine beauty, grace and accomplishment.

[[Edward H. Schafer]] notes that in East Asian religious art the Kinnara is often confused with the [[Kalaviṅka]], which is also a half-human half-bird hybrid mythical creature, but that the two are actually distinct and unrelated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last=Schafer | first=Edward H. | authorlink=Edward H. Schafer | title=The Golden Peaches of Samarkand: A Study of Tʻang Exotics | publisher=University of California Press | year=1963 | page=103 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Burma==
[[File:Shan peacock dance.jpg|thumb|[[Shan people|Shan]] kinnara and kinnari dance]]
In Burma (Myanmar), kinnara are called keinnaya or kinnaya ({{my|ကိန္နရာ}} {{IPA-my|kèɪɴnəjà|}}). Female kinnara are called keinnayi or kinnayi ({{my|ကိန္နရီ}} {{IPA-my|kèɪɴnəjì|}}). In [[Shan language|Shan]], they are {{my|ၵိင်ႇၼရႃႇ}} ({{IPA-shn|kìŋ nǎ ràː}}) and {{my|ၵိင်ႇၼရီႇ}} ({{IPA-shn|kìŋ nǎ rì}}) respectively. [[Buddhism in Burma|Burmese Buddhists]] believe that out of the 136 past animal lives of Buddha, four were kinnara. The kinnari is also one of the 108 symbols on the footprint of Buddha. 
[[File:Flag of Kayah State.svg|thumb|right|The flag of [[Kayah State]] (Karenni State) includes a depiction of the kinnara.]]
In Burmese art, kinnari are depicted with covered breasts. The [[Myanmar Academy Awards]] statue for Academy Award winners is of a kinnari.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mmtimes.com/2010/feature/509/academy02.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-09-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100925180148/http://mmtimes.com/2010/feature/509/academy02.html |archivedate=25 September 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The kinnara and kinnari couple is considered the symbol of the [[Karenni]] people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.myanmar.gov.mm/myanmartimes/no68/myanmartimes4-68/Timeouts/6.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-09-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20070822213342/http://www.myanmar.gov.mm/myanmartimes/no68/myanmartimes4-68/Timeouts/6.htm |archivedate=22 August 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cambodia==

In [[Cambodia]], the kinnaras are known in the [[Khmer language]] as '''kenar''' ({{lang|km|កិន្នរ}}, {{lang|km|កិន្នរា}}; {{IPA-km|keˈnɑː|IPA}} or ''{{IPA-km|ken nɑ ˈraː|IPA}}'').  The female counterpart, the kinnari ({{lang|km|កិន្នរី}}; {{IPA-km|ken nɑ ˈrəj|IPA}}), are depicted in Cambodian art and literature more often than the male counterparts. They are commonly seen carved into support figurines for the columns of [[Khmer architecture|post-Angkorian architecture]]. Kinnari are considered symbols of beauty and are skilled dancers.&lt;ref&gt;Headley, Robert K. (1997). Modern Cambodian-English Dictionary, Dunwoody Press&lt;/ref&gt; The kinnari is a character archetype in the repertoire of the [[Royal Ballet of Cambodia]], appearing as mischievous groups that have a strong allurement. A classical dance titled ''robam kinar'' depicts kinnaris playing in a lotus pond.

==India==
In the Sanskrit language, the name Kinnara contains a question mark ([[Sanskrit]] : किन्नर?) i.e. is this man?. In Hindu mythology, Kinnara is described as half man, half-horse, and half-bird. The Vishnudharmottara describes Kinnara as half-man and half-horse, but the correct nature of Kinnara as Buddhists understood is half-man and half-bird. The figure of Yaksha with a horse head illustrated in Bodh Gaya sculptures in however a Kinnari as the Jataka illustrating it treats her as a demi-god. According to the Jatakas, Kinnaras are fairies and are shown as going in pairs noted for mutual love and devotion. In the Chanda Kinnara Jataka the devotion of the Kinnarai to her wounded Kinnara husband brings Indra on the scene to cure him from the wound. The Kinnaras are noted for their long life.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web |title=Mythical Animals in Indian Art |url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=dMI4rZuRs1MC&amp;pg=PA14&amp;dq=Kinnaras&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=KFoqVarqFdG0uATgx4DwAg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Kinnaras&amp;f=false#Directive |year=1985 |publisher=Abhinav Publications }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jatakas describe the Kinnaras as innocent and harmless, hop like birds, are fond of music and song, and with the female beating a drum and male playing on lute. Such harmless creatures are described in Jataka No.481 as being caught, put into cages, and thus presented to kings for their delight. In Jataka No.504, we have the autobiography of a Kinnara who describes the Kinnara class as human-like the wild things deem us; huntsmen call us goblins still. The Kinnaras can sing, play the flute and dance with soft movements of the body. Kalidasa in his Kumara Sambhava describes them as dwelling in the Himalayas. Kinnaras lived also over the hills of Pandaraka, Trikutaka, Mallangiri, Candapabbata, and Gandhamandana (Jataka No. 485). They were tender-hearted and Jataka No. 540 refers to the story of the Kinnaras nursing a human baby whose parents have gone away to the woods. Yet, we find that they were looked upon as queer animals and were hunted, captured and presented to the kings as entertainment. Flowers formed their dress. Their food was flower pollen and their cosmetics were made of flower perfumes.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The depiction of Kinnara in early Indian art is an oft-repeated theme. The ancient sculptures of Sanchi, Barhut, Amaravati, Nagarjunakonda, Mathura, and the paintings of Ajanta depict Kinnaras invariably. Frequently, they are seen in the sculptures flanking the stupas. In this case, they hold garlands or trays containing flowers in their hands for the worship of the Stupas. Sometimes, the Kinnaras appear in the sculptures holding garland in right hand and tray in the left hand. They also appear before Bodhi-Drumas, Dharmacakras, or playing a musical instrument. As such, the portrayal of Kinnaras in early Indian sculpture art is very common.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The images of coupled Kinnara and Kinnari can be found in [[Borobudur]], [[Mendut]], [[Pawon]], Sewu, Sari, and [[Prambanan]] temples. Usually, they are depicted as birds with human heads, or humans with lower limbs of birds. The pair of Kinnara and Kinnari usually is depicted guarding [[Kalpataru]], the tree of life, and sometimes guarding a jar of treasure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Pawon | work = National Library of Indonesia, Temples of Indonesia |url = http://candi.pnri.go.id/temples_en/deskripsi-central_java-pawon_38}}&lt;/ref&gt; A pair of Kinnara-Kinnari bas-reliefs of Sari temple is unique, depicting Kinnara as celestial humans with birds' wings attached to their backs, very similar to popular image of [[angel]]s.

There are bas-relief in [[Borobudur]] depicting the story of the famous kinnari, [[Manohara]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Borobudur: Golden Tales of the Buddhas | first = John | last = Miksic | publisher = Tuttle Publishing | year = 2012 | isbn = 9781462909100| url = https://books.google.co.id/books?id=jwzQAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA77&amp;lpg=PA77&amp;dq=manohara+story+Borobudur&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=TuZ72i32xf&amp;sig=fAk5WTnwGvkKm7sgcUrMnXBpk5w&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiZv-PW79_VAhWLLY8KHal5Dcc4ChDoAQgpMAE#v=onepage&amp;q=manohara%20story%20Borobudur&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Thailand==
[[File:Kinnari at Phra Meru of HRH Princess Galyani Vadhana.jpg|thumb|left|Sculpture of a ''kinnari'' which was decorated in the royal crematorium of Princess [[Galyani Vadhana]] at [[Sanam Luang]], [[Bangkok]], [[Thailand]] (2008).]]

The Kinnari, (usually spelt 'Kinnaree' as noted below) ({{lang-th|กินรี}}) in Thai literature originates from India, but was modified to fit in with the Thai way of thinking. The Thai Kinnari is depicted as a young woman wearing an angel-like costume. The lower part of the body is similar to a bird, and should enable her to fly between the human and the mystical worlds. The most popular portrayal of Kinnaree in Thai art probably the golden figures of kinnaree adorned the [[Wat Phra Kaew]]  in Bangkok, which describe a half-maiden, half-goose figure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Architecture of Thailand: A Guide to Tradition and Contemporary Forms | author1 = Nithi Sthapitanond | author2 = Brian Mertens | publisher = Editions Didier Millet | year = 2012 | isbn = 9789814260862| url = https://books.google.co.id/books?id=hC5TMZ5QTV0C&amp;pg=PA178&amp;dq=kinnaree+wat+phra+kaew&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwja5fmF_t_VAhXJrY8KHf9pC2sQ6AEILzAC#v=onepage&amp;q=kinnaree%20wat%20phra%20kaew&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most famous Kinnari in Thailand is the figure known as ''Manora'' (derived from [[Manohara]]), a heroine in one of the stories collected in "Pannas Jataka" a [[Pali]] tome written by a [[Chiangmai]] Buddhist monk and sage around AD 1450–1470.&lt;ref name="Radhakrishnan"&gt;{{cite book | title = The Big Book of World Mythology | author = Reeja Radhakrishnan | publisher = Penguin UK | year = 2015 | isbn = 9789352140077| url = https://books.google.co.id/books?id=8tctCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT333&amp;lpg=PT333&amp;dq=Kinnaree+in+Thai+mythology&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=HbqH6WBU0Z&amp;sig=u0B8HJTamKY-8FuVYkOtxgn4eEo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiw16zg_N_VAhVKNI8KHTamDxc4HhDoAQhAMAU#v=onepage&amp;q=Kinnaree%20in%20Thai%20mythology&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is supposed to be a collection of 50 stories of the past lives of the [[Buddha]], known to Buddhists as the [[Jataka]]. The specific tale about Manora the Kinnaree was called Sudhana Jataka, after Prince Sudhana, the [[bodhisattva]] who was also the hero of the story and the husband of Manora.

==Tibet==
In Tibet the Kinnara is known as the Miamchi ({{bo|t=མིའམ་ཅི་|w=mi'am ci}}) or 'shang-shang' ({{bo|t=ཤང་ཤང|w=shang shang}}) (Sanskrit: civacivaka). This [[chimera (mythology)|chimera]] is depicted either with just the head or including the whole torso of a human including the arms with the lower body as that of a winged bird. In [[Nyingma]] Mantrayana traditions of [[Mahayoga]] Buddhadharma, the shang-shang symbolizes 'enlightened activity' (Wylie: phrin las). The shang-shang is a celestial musician,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Mythical creatures, Kinnara | work = Himalayan Buddhist Art | url = https://himalayanbuddhistart.wordpress.com/tag/kinnara/}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is often iconographically depicted with cymbals. A [[homonym]]ic play on words is evident which is a marker of oral lore: the '[[shang]]' ({{bo|t=གཆང|w=gchang}}) is a cymbal or gong like ritual instrument in the indigenous traditions of the Himalaya. The shang-shang is sometimes depicted as the king of the [[Garuda]].

The '''New Testament verses not included in modern English translations''' are [[Chapters and verses of the Bible|verses]] of the [[New Testament]] that existed in older versions of the [[Bible]] (primarily the [[King James Version]]), but did not appear or were relegated to footnotes in later versions, such as the [[New International Version]]. Scholars generally regarded these verses as later additions to the original text.

Although many lists of missing verses specifically name the NIV as the version that had omitted them, these same verses were missing from the main text (and mostly relegated to footnotes) by the Revised Version of 1881, the American Standard Version of 1901,&lt;ref&gt;Example, Benjamin G. Wilkinson, ''[http://www.present-truth.org/6-Library/Authorized%20Bible-all.pdf Our Authorized Bible Vindicated]'' (1930).&lt;/ref&gt; the Revised Standard Version of 1947,&lt;ref&gt;Example, J.J. Ray, ''God Wrote Only One Bible'' (1955) ; http://www.asureguidetoheaven.org/onebible.pdf .&lt;/ref&gt; the Today's English Version (the Good News Version) of 1966,&lt;ref&gt;Example, http://christianboydiary.blogspot.com/2010/01/verses-omitted-from-niv-and-good-news.html .&lt;/ref&gt; and several others. Lists of "missing" verses and phrases go back to the Revised Version&lt;ref&gt;E.g., Alexander Gordon, ''Christian Doctrine in the Light of New Testament Revision'' (1882, London)[esp. pages 5-6]; Bejamin G. Wilkinson, ''[[Our Authorized Bible Vindicated]]'' (1930, Washington, DC)[and often reprinted].&lt;/ref&gt; and to the Revised Standard Version,&lt;ref&gt;E.g., Jaspar James Ray, ''God Wrote Only One Bible'' (1955, Junction City, Ore.) [http://www.asureguidetoheaven.org/onebible.pdf]; Peter J. Thuesen, ''In Discordance with the Scriptures: American Protestant Battles over Translating the Bible'' (1999, Oxford Univ. Press).&lt;/ref&gt; without waiting for the appearance of the NIV (1973).  Some of these lists of "missing verses" specifically mention "sixteen verses" - although the lists are not all the same.&lt;ref&gt;For example, [http://kjv.landmarkbiblebaptist.net/missing-verses.html]; [http://americanwisdomseries.com/%21%21%20%20%20aa%20%20Missing%20verses.html]; [http://www.churchofisrael.org/articles-from-the-watchman/the-watchman-summer-2015/the-niv-a-corruption-of-god-s-word/]; [http://www.thestandard.org.uk/god-faith-miracles/item/missing-verses-changed-words-in-modern-bibles-compared-to-the-kjv-3]; [https://klifemin.org/2017/08/03/sixteen-versus-discovered-missing-from-the-word-of-god/]; and many more; to which can be added numerous internet videos, such as: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifn9QfX3RPE]; [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QidldvKJDtY]; [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDNq7BpYTJU] ; [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbXn9Yn3eU0]; etc.&lt;/ref&gt;

The citations of manuscript authority use the designations popularized in the catalog of [[Caspar Rene Gregory]], and used in such resources (which are also used in this remainder of this article) as Souter,&lt;ref&gt;[[Alexander Souter]], ''Novvm Testamentvm Graece'' (1910, Oxford, Clarendon Press)(using as its main text the Greek text underlying the RV, edited by Archdeacon Edwin Palmer, with an apparatus worked up by Souter)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nestle-Aland]],&lt;ref&gt;Eberhard and Erwin Nestle (early editions) and Kurt and Barbara Aland, et al. (recent revisions), ''Novum Testamentum Graece'', (26th ed. 1979, 27th ed. 1993, 28th ed. 2012, Stuttgart, Germany, Deutsche Bibelgeselischaft)&lt;/ref&gt; and the UBS Greek New Testament&lt;ref&gt;Kurt Aland, et al., edd., ''The Greek New Testament'' (2nd ed. 1968, 3rd ed. 1976, 4th ed. 1993, 5th ed. 2014, Stuttgart, Germany, United Bible Societies)(the mss citations are virtually unchanged from edition to edition but the confidence ratings for the choices made for the main text are sometimes revised; the confidence ratings also appear in Metzger's ''Textual Commentary on the Greek New Testament'' cited below).&lt;/ref&gt; (which gives particular attention to 'problem' verses such as these).&lt;ref&gt;See, generally, Kurt Aland and Barbara Aland, ''The Text of The New Testament'' (rev. ed. 1989, Grand Rapids, Mich., Eerdmans).&lt;/ref&gt; Some Greek editions published well before the 1881 Revised Version made similar omissions.&lt;ref&gt;These references are primarily obtained from the catalog of [[Eduard Reuss]], ''Bibliotheca Novi Testamenti Graeci'' (1872, Brunswick). One reason for including this information is to refute the accusations made by some KJVOs that Bishops Westcott and Hort were the originators and instigators of all the omissions occurring in modern versions.&lt;/ref&gt;

The removal or relegation of these verses was done in keeping with the principle of critical editing, as articulated (but not originated) by what Rev. [[Samuel Thomas Bloomfield|Samuel T. Bloomfield]] wrote in 1832, "Surely, nothing dubious ought to be admitted into 'the sure word' of 'The Book of Life'."&lt;ref&gt;Samuel T. Bloomfield, ''The Greek New Testament'' (first ed. 1832, Cambridge) vol.2, page 128.&lt;/ref&gt; A movement called [[King James Only Movement|King James Version Only (KJVO)]], which believes that only the [[King James Version]] (KJV) of the Bible (1611) in English is the true word of God, has sharply criticized these translations for the omitted verses.&lt;ref&gt;E.g., [https://klifemin.org/2017/08/03/sixteen-versus-discovered-missing-from-the-word-of-god/ ''Sixteen verses discovered missing from the word of GOD!'']; http://kjv.landmarkbiblebaptist.net/missing-verses.html; http://www.missingverses.com/ ;.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;E.g.,
[http://www.thestandard.org.uk/god-faith-miracles/item/missing-verses-changed-words-in-modern-bibles-compared-to-the-kjv-3 Missing Verses &amp; changed words in modern Bibles compared to the KJV?]; [http://kjv.landmarkbiblebaptist.net/missing-verses.html The NIV leaves out 16 entire verses!].&lt;/ref&gt;

In most instances another verse, elsewhere in the New Testament and remaining in modern versions, is very similar to the verse that was omitted because of its doubtful provenance.  These are mentioned to show that the omission of the doubtful verse did not cause the loss of the teaching it expressed.

== The sixteen omitted verses ==

=== (1) Matthew 17:21 ===

'''KJV:''' ''Howbeit this kind goeth not out but by prayer and fasting.''

'''Reason:''' The verse closely resembles Mark 9:29, but it is lacking in Matthew in [[Codex Sinaiticus|א]] (original handwriting), [[Codex Vaticanus|B]], θ, some Italic &amp; Syriac &amp; Coptic &amp; Ethiopic mss. It is, however, found in this place in some Greek mss not quite so ancient - [[Codex Ephraemi Rescriptus|C]], [[Codex Bezae|D]], K, L - as well as some other mss of the ancient versions. It is believed to have been assimilated from Mark.&lt;ref&gt;.[[Bruce M. Metzger]], ''A Textual Commentary on the Greek New Testament A Companion Volume to the UBS Greek New Testament'' (1971, United Bible Societies) loc.cit (this book focuses on the 'problem' passages in terms of translation or editing, and is particularly helpful in explaining the likelihood or unlikelihood of scribal errors).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== (2) Matthew 18:11 ===

'''KJV:''' ''For the Son of man is come to save that which was lost.''

'''Reason:''' This verse is lacking in א,B,L (original handwriting), θ, ƒ&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, ƒ&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;, some old Italic &amp; Syriac &amp; Coptic &amp; Georgian mss, and such ancient sources as the Apostolic Canons, Eusebius, Jerome, and others.  It is found in some other sources, not quite so ancient, such as D,K,W,X, and the Latin Vulgate. It is not found in any manuscript before the 5th century.&lt;ref&gt;Lincoln H. Blumell, ''A Text-critical comparison of the King James New Testament with certain modern translations'', Studies in the Bible and Antiquity, vol. 3 (2011) page 80.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to [[Bruce Metzger]], "There can be little doubt that the words ... are spurious here, being omitted by the earliest witnesses representing several textual types.... [This verse was] manifestly borrowed by copyists from Luke 19:10."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;[[Bruce M. Metzger]], ''A Textual Commentary on the Greek New Testament A Companion Volume to the UBS Greek New Testament (1971, United Bible Societies) loc.cit.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== (3) Matthew 23:14 ===

'''KJV:''' ''Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye devour widows' houses, and for a pretence make long prayer: therefore ye shall receive the greater damnation.''

'''Reason:''' This verse is very similar to Mark 12:40 and Luke 20:47.  This verse is lacking altogether in א,B,D,L,Z,θ, ƒ&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, Ethiopic, Armenian, several Italic and Syrian and Coptic mss, and the writings of several early Church Fathers.  It appears before verse 13 in K,W, and several minuscules.  It appears after verse 13 in ƒ&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;, some Italic and Syriac and Coptic mss. The fact that it is absent from the most ancient sources of multiple text types and that the sources that do contain the verse disagree about its placement, as well as the fact that it is a repetition of verses found elsewhere, show "that verse 14 is an interpolation derived from the parallel in Mark 12:40 or Luke 20:47 is clear."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== (4) Mark 7:16 ===

'''KJV:''' ''If any man have ears to hear, let him hear.''

'''Reason:''' This verse is nearly identical with verses 4:9 and 4:23. This verse here is lacking in א,B,L,Δ (original handwriting), some Coptic mss.  It is included in mss only slightly less ancient, A,D,K,W,ƒ&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;,ƒ&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;, Italic mss, the Vulgate, some other ancient versions. As it is missing in the very oldest resources and yet is identical to verses that remain, many editors seem confident in omitting its appearance here.

=== (5 &amp; 6) Mark 9:44 &amp; 9:46 ===

'''KJV:''' ''Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.'' ..  (Both verses identical to each other, and to 9:48, which is still in the main text)

'''Reason:''' Both verses 44 and 46 are duplicates of verse 48, which remains in the text.  Verses 44 and 46 are both lacking in א,B,C,L,W,ƒ&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, and some mss of the ancient versions, but appear in somewhat later sources such as A,D,K,θ, some Italic mss and the Vulgate.  It is possible that verse 48 was repeated by a copyist as an epistrophe, for an oratorical flourish.&lt;ref&gt;Lincoln H. Blumell, ''A Text-critical comparison of the King James New Testament with certain modern translations'', Studies in the Bible and Antiquity, vol. 3 (2011) page 86.&lt;/ref&gt; The UBS text assigns this omission a confidence rating of A.

=== (7) Mark 11:26 ===

'''KJV:''' ''But if ye do not forgive, neither will your Father which is in heaven forgive your trespasses.''

'''Reason:''' This verse is very similar to Matthew 6:15.  This verse appeared in the Complutensian Polyglot and most Textus Receptus editions but Erasmus noted that it was missing from 'most' Greek manuscripts.&lt;ref&gt;Lincoln H. Blumell, ''A Text-critical comparison of the King James New Testament with certain modern translations'', Studies in the Bible and Antiquity, vol. 3 (2011) pages 87- 88.&lt;/ref&gt;  The UBS edition gave the omission of this verse a confidence rating of A.

=== (8) Mark 15:28 ===

'''KJV:''' ''And the scripture was fulfilled, which saith, "And he was numbered with the transgressors."''

'''Reasons:''' This verse is similar to Luke 22:37.  It does not appear in any New Testament ms prior to the end of the 6th century. &lt;ref&gt;Lincoln H. Blumell, ''A Text-critical comparison of the King James New Testament with certain modern translations'', Studies in the Bible and Antiquity, vol. 3 (2011) page 88.&lt;/ref&gt;    

=== (9) Luke 17:36 ===

'''KJV:''' ''Two men shall be in the field; the one shall be taken, and the other left.''

'''Reason:''' It is possible that this verse is a repetition of Matthew 24:40. Even the King James Version had doubts about this verse, as it provided (in the original 1611 edition and still in many high quality editions) a sidenote that said, "This 36th verse is wanting in most of the Greek copies." This verse is missing from Tyndale's version (1534) and the Geneva Bible (1557).  Among major Textus Receptus editions, this verse does not appear in the editions of Erasmus (1516-1535), Aldus (1518), Colinaeus (1534), Stephanus 1st - 3rd eds (1546-1550), but it did appear in the Complutensian (1514), and in the margins of Stephanus 4th ed (1551), and all of Elzivir's and  Beza's eds (1565-1604).&lt;ref&gt;Herman C. Hoskier, ''A Full Account and Collation of the Codex Evangelium 604'' (1890, London) App. B, page 5; Lincoln H. Blumell, ''A Text-critical comparison of the King James New Testament with certain modern translations'', Studies in the Bible and Antiquity, vol. 3 (2011) page 95; F.H.A. Scrivener, ''Novum Testamentum, textus Stephanici'' (1902, London) loc.cit.; Eduard Reuss, ''Biblioteca Novi Testamenti Geaeci ..., (1872, Brunswick) passim.&lt;/ref&gt; In modern conservative Greek editions it is also omitted from the main text of Scrivener's Greek NT according to the Textus Receptus, and the two Majority Text editions.  Verse 36 is included by very few Greek manuscripts of the [[Western text-type]] and by [[Vetus Latina|Old-Latin]] and [[Vulgate]] manuscripts.&lt;ref&gt;NA27, p. 218&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Bruce M. |last=Metzger |title=A Textual Commentary on the Greek New Testament |p=142–143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== (10) John 5:3–4 ===
{{main|John 5#Interpolation (verses 3b-4)}}

'''KJV:''' &lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; . . . ''waiting for the moving of the water.

&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;'' For an Angel went down at a certain season into the pool, and troubled the water: whosoever then first after the troubling of the water stepped in was made whole of whatsoever disease he had.''

(Note: not only is verse 4 omitted, but also the tail end of verse 3.)

'''Reason:''' These words clearly were not in the original text of the Gospel.  They are lacking in the "earliest and best witnesses", and several ancient Greek mss that do contain them enclose them with markings indicating doubts about their authenticity, the passage contains words or expressions that appear nowhere else in John (such as the Greek words for "at a certain season [= occasionally]" and "stirring" and "diseases"), and the mss that contain this verse differ among themselves as to the wording.&lt;ref&gt;[[Frederick Henry [Ambrose] Scrivener]], ''A Plain Introduction to the Criticism of the New Testament'' (3d ed. 1883, London) pages 607-609; [[Bruce M. Metzger]], ''A Textual Commentary on the Greek New Testament A Companion Volume to the UBS Greek New Testament'' (1971, United Bible Societies) loc.cit.&lt;/ref&gt; The UBS text gave the omission of this verse a confidence rating of A.  This verse was omitted from Edward Harwood's Greek NT (1776), marked as doubtful in Griesbach's editions (1777), and thereafter generally relegated to a footnote, enclosed in brackets, or omitted completely.

[[Henry Alford]] wrote, "The spuriousness of this controverted passage can hardly be questioned."&lt;ref&gt;[[Henry Alford]], ''The New Testament for English Readers'' (1863, London) vol. 1, part ii, loc.cit.&lt;/ref&gt; Without the words at issue the context simply states that a swimming or bathing pool in or near Jerusalem was a gathering place for sick and crippled people, some of whom sought to get into the pool (either for physical comfort or for ritual cleansing) and it was there that Jesus performed a miraculous healing.  But the words quoted above complicate this story by asserting that miraculous cures were already taking place at this pool in the absence of Jesus, owing to the unpredictable intervention of an (apparently invisible) angel.  This passage in John 5 is the only mention of this pool - no such miraculous pool is mentioned in Josephus or other histories&lt;ref&gt;E. W. G. Masterman, ''The Pool of Bethesda'', The Biblical World, vol. 25, nr. 2 (Feb 1905) page 88.&lt;/ref&gt; The words in question do not appear in the oldest manuscripts, and in those manuscripts that contain them they are sometimes marked as doubtful, and differ from manuscript to manuscript "with that extreme variation in the reading which so often indicates grounds for suspicion".&lt;ref&gt;[[Frederick Henry [Ambrose] Scrivener]], ''A Plain Introduction to the Criticism of the New Testament'' (3d ed. 1883, London) page 607.&lt;/ref&gt;

The italicized words do not appear at all in '''p'''&lt;sup&gt;66, 75&lt;/sup&gt;, א, A(original hand), B, C(original hand), L, and some Italic, Syriac, Coptic, and Latin Vulgate manuscripts, and in quotations of the story by several early Greek Fathers.  Verse 4 ("For an angel ...") appears but without the concluding words of verse 3 ('waiting for the stirring of the water ...") in A (where it says the angel "bathed in the water" rather than "descended into the water"), L, 18 (fourteenth century), and an Egyptian manuscript.  The concluding words of verse 3 but not any of verse 4 appear in D, 33 (ninth century), and some Latin manuscripts. The entire italicized passage appears in C(third hand), K (also with the angel "bathed in the water"), Δ,Θ,Ψ, and numerous other manuscripts, and some Italic, Syriac, Coptic, and Armenian manuscripts, and several Latin Fathers, Some manuscripts - S,Λ,Π, and a few others - contain the words enclosed by marks of doubt.  Among the manuscripts that contain this sentence-and-a-half, there are many variations and permutations.&lt;ref&gt;[[Frederick Henry [Ambrose] Scrivener]], ''A Plain Introduction to the Criticism of the New Testament'' (3d ed. 1883, London) pages 607-609; Brooke Foss Westcott &amp; Fenton John Anthony Hort, ''The New Testament in the Original Greek'' (1881, Cambridge &amp; London, Macmillan &amp; Co.) vol. 2 (Appendix) page 77; [[Bruce M. Metzger]], ''A Textual Commentary on the Greek New Testament A Companion Volume to the UBS Greek New Testament'' (1971, United Bible Societies) loc.cit.; UBS, loc.cit.; Kurt Aland &amp; Barbara Aland, ''The Text of the New Testament'' (2nd ed.1989, Grand Rapids, Eerdmans) page 303.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Revised Version (1881) omitted the italicized words from its main text, making the passage read: "... a multitude of them that were sick, blind, halt, withered. [5] And a certain man was there ...", and as a side-note, "Many ancient authorities insert, wholly or in part," and here present the italicized words exactly as they appeared in the KJV.  Several modern versions similarly relegate those words to a footnote, and some others (such as Moffatt) include the words in the main text but enclosed in brackets with an explanation in a footnote.

=== (11) Acts 8:37 ===
{{main|Acts 8#Verse 37}}

'''KJV:''' ''And Philip said, "If thou believest with all thine heart, thou mayest." And he [the Eunuch] answered and said, "I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God."''

'''Modern versions:''' Either sidelined to a footnote (e.g., RV, RSV, NRSV, NIV, Hodges &amp; Farstad Majority Text), or omitted altogether (e.g., Moffatt, Goodspeed, Schonfield, Robinson &amp; Pierpont Majority Text).

'''Reason:''' The earliest Greek manuscript ([[Codex Laudianus|E&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt;/E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]) of the New Testament to include this verse dates from the late sixth or early seventh century{{sfn|Metzger|1964|p=52}}&lt;ref&gt;Lincoln H. Blumell, ''A Text-critical comparison of the King James New Testament with certain modern translations'', Studies in the Bible and Antiquity, vol. 3 (2011) page 114.&lt;/ref&gt;  and it is only found in Western witnesses to the text with many minor variations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Bruce M. |last=Metzger |title=A Textual Commentary on the Greek New Testament |location=Stuttgart |publisher=United Bible Societies |date=1971 |p=359 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of Greek manuscripts copied after 600 AD and the majority of translations made after 600 AD do not include the verse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite |last=Becker |first=Siegbert W. |url=http://www.wlsessays.net/files/BeckerVariant.pdf |title=Verbal Inspiration and the Variant Readings |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150930151207/http://www.wlsessays.net/files/BeckerVariant.pdf |archive-date=September 30, 2015 |quote="The fact is that all truly ancient manuscripts omit it entirely, and that almost all very late manuscripts omit it in whole or in part."}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wels.net/cgi-bin/site.pl?1518&amp;cuTopic_topicID=813&amp;cuItem_itemID=967 |work=WELS Topical Q&amp;A |title= Acts 8:37 - Why Omitted in NIV? |publisher=[[Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod]] |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080102124228/https://www.wels.net/cgi-bin/site.pl?1518&amp;cuTopic_topicID=813&amp;cuItem_itemID=967 |archive-date=2 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wels.net/cgi-bin/site.pl?1518&amp;cuTopic_topicID=813&amp;cuItem_itemID=1217 |work=WELS Topical Q&amp;A |title= Acts 8:37 - Decision Theology? |publisher=[[Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod]] |quote=The NIV places Acts 8:37 in a footnote because the preponderance of manuscript evidence indicates that these words are not part of the original text of Acts.

This verse appears in E (specifically, a portion from a codex consisting of Acts, dated to the 6th century, once owned by Archb. William Laud and therefore called the Codex Laudianus, sometimes designated E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; or E&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt;) and several cursives dating after the 9th century (showing many variants), "manuscripts of good character, but quite inadequate to prove the authenticity of the verse," according to F.H.A.

Its omission has a USB confidence rating of A.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bruce M. Metzger]], ''A Textual Commentary on the Greek New Testament A Companion Volume to the UBS Greek New Testament'' (1971, United Bible Societies) loc.cit.; USB version loc.cit.&lt;/ref&gt; But, as Kurt Aland noted, "The external evidence [for the inclusion of this verse] is so weak that the Nestle apparatus cited only the support for insertion and not for the original omission.... The voice which speaks in Acts 8:37 is from a later age, with an interest in the detailed justification of the [Ethiopian] treasuerer's desire for baptism."&lt;ref&gt;Kurt Aland &amp; Barbara Aland, The Text of The New Testament (rev. ed. 1987, Grand Rapids, Eerdmans) pages 303-304.&lt;/ref&gt; It was omitted in the Complutensian edition, and included in Erasmus's editions only because he found it as a late note in the margin of a secondary manuscript and, from Erasmus, it found its way into other Textus Receptus editions and then the KJV.&lt;ref&gt;Brooke Foss Westcott &amp; Fenton John Anthony Hort, ''The New Testament in the Original Greek'' (1881, Cambridge &amp; London, Macmillan &amp; Co.) vol. 2 (Appendix) page 93.&lt;/ref&gt; As Scrivener said, "We cannot safely question the spuriousness of this verse, which all the critical editors condemn. ...."&lt;ref name="Frederick Henry 1883, page 615"/&gt;

=== (12) Acts 15:34 ===

'''KJV:''' ''Notwithstanding it pleased Silas to abide there still.''

'''Reason:''' Although this verse, or something similar to it, is quite old, it does not appear in the oldest manuscripts, and the manuscripts that do contain it are inconsistent about its text.  It does not appear at all in א, A,B,E,L,P,Ψ, and other mss, some Italic, Syriac, Coptic, Slavonic, the best mss of the Latin Vulgate, and other versions, and quotations of this paragraph in Chrysostom.

The verse as it appears in the KJV is found in less ancient Greek mss (cursives, after the 9th century) and some other Italic, Syriac, Coptic, Armenian, Ethiopic, and other versions.  However some other, equally old resources, such as the C codex, and several cursives, change one word to make the verse read, "Notwithstanding it pleased Silas that they should abide there still."

Several other sources, such as Codex D (Codex Bezae) and some Italic mss, extend the verse with the ending, "and Judas traveled alone"; and a couple of Italic and Latin mss add to that, "to Jerusalem." &lt;ref&gt;Brooke Foss Westcott &amp; Fenton John Anthony Hort, ''The New Testament in the Original Greek'' (1881, Cambridge &amp; London, Macmillan &amp; Co.) vol. 2 (Appendix) page 96; [[Frederick Henry [Ambrose] Scrivener]], ''A Plain Introduction to the Criticism of the New Testament'' (3d ed. 1883, London) pages 619-620; [[Bruce M. Metzger]], ''A Textual Commentary on the Greek New Testament A Companion Volume to the UBS Greek New Testament'' (1971, United Bible Societies), loc.cit.; UBS loc.cit..&lt;/ref&gt; Erasmus annotated this verse with the comment that the reference to Judas did not appear in any Greek ms known to him.&lt;ref&gt;Lincoln H. Blumell, ''A Text-critical comparison of the King James New Testament with certain modern translations'', Studies in the Bible and Antiquity, vol. 3 (2011) page 116.&lt;/ref&gt;

As F.H.A. Scrivener put it, "No doubt this verse is an unauthorised addition, self-condemned indeed by its numerous variations. ... [It must have begun as] a marginal gloss, designed to explain how ... Silas was at hand in verse 40, conveniently for Saint Paul to choose him as a companion in travel.&lt;ref&gt;[[Frederick Henry [Ambrose] Scrivener]], ''A Plain Introduction to the Criticism of the New Testament'' (3d ed. 1883, London) page 620.&lt;/ref&gt;

This verse was omitted from the Revised Version and most modern versions, but many versions include it in a footnote.

=== (13) Acts 24:6–8 ===

'''KJV:''' &lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; Who also hath gone about to profane the Temple, whom we took, &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; '' and would have judged according to our law.

&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;'' But the chief captain, Lysias, came upon us, and with great violence took him away out of our hands,

&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; ''Commanding his accusers to come unto thee, '' &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; by examining of whom thyself mayest take knowledge of all these things, whereof we accuse him.

&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; (Note above that not only is verse 7 omitted, but also the end of verse 6 and beginning of verse 8.)

To clarify, only the italicized words are omitted, removing all of verse 7, but leaving the beginning of verse 6 and most of verse 8.  The resulting text looks like this (from the Revised Version):

'''RV:''' &lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; ''Who moreover assayed to profane the temple; on whom we also laid hold;

&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; ''from whom thou wilt be able, by examining him thyself, to take knowledge of all these things, whereof we accuse him.

'''Reason:'''  These words are not found in the oldest sources - '''p'''&lt;sup&gt;74&lt;/sup&gt;,א, A, B, P, several minuscules, some mss of the Italic, Vulgate, Coptic, and Georgian versions.  The words are found in sources not quite as old - E,Ψ, some minuscules (with many variants), some Italic mss, and the Armenian and Ethiopic versions.  The absence of these words from the earliest resources, and the several variations in the resources in which they appear, made their exclusion probable but not a certainty (the UBS assigned the omission a confidence rating of only D).&lt;ref&gt;[[Bruce M. Metzger]], ''A Textual Commentary on the Greek New Testament A Companion Volume to the UBS Greek New Testament (1971, United Bible Societies) loc.cit.; Lincoln H. Blumell, ''A Text-critical comparison of the King James New Testament with certain modern translations'', Studies in the Bible and Antiquity, vol. 3 (2011) pages 116-117.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== (14) Acts 28:29 ===

'''KJV:''' ''And when he had said these words, the Jews departed, and had great reasoning'' [arguing] '' among themselves.''

'''Reason:'''  This verse is lacking in the oldest sources - '''p'''&lt;sup&gt;74&lt;/sup&gt;, א, A,B,E,ψ, several minuscules, some Italic, Vulgate, Syriac, Ethiopic, and Coptic mss, and the Armenian and Georgian versions.  They appear only in later sources such as P (9th century) and several minuscules, and a smattering of Italic mss..  The UBS gave the omission of this verse a confidence rating of B.  Erasmus of Rotterdam, in working up the very first printed Greek New Testament from a multitude of manuscripts, included this note for this verse: "I did not find the words in several old manuscripts."&lt;ref&gt;Lincoln H. Blumell, ''A Text-critical comparison of the King James New Testament with certain modern translations'', Studies in the Bible and Antiquity, vol. 3 (2011) page 118.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== (15) Romans 16:24 ===

'''KJV:''' ''The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.'' &lt;br&gt;

'''Reason:'''  This verse occurs twice in the KJV in this chapter; once as the conclusion to verse 20 and again as verse 24, which is the occurrence omitted from modern versions. The first occurrence (as part of verse 20) is very well supported by ancient resources, including '''p'''&lt;sup&gt;46&lt;/sup&gt;, א, A,B,C,P,Ψ, and several ancient versions (although some omit 'Christ' and some omit 'Amen'); its inclusion got a UBS confidence rating of B.   However, its recurrence as verse 24 is not so well supported.  It does not occur after verse 23 in '''p'''&lt;sup&gt;46 &amp; 61&lt;/sup&gt;, א, A,B,C, several minuscules and some other sources; it does appear in D,G,Ψ, minuscule 629 (although G,Ψ, and 629—and both leading compilations of the so-called Majority Text—end the Epistle with this verse and do not follow it with verses 25-27) and several later minuscules; P and some minuscules do not have it as verse 24 but move it to the very end of the Epistle, after verse 27. Westcott and Hort said of the recurrence as verse 24, "This last combination, which rests on hardly any authority, and is due to late conflation, was adopted by Erasmus from the Latin and is preserved in the 'Received Text'."&lt;ref&gt;Brooke Foss Westcott &amp; Fenton John Anthony Hort, ''The New Testament in the Original Greek'' (1881, Cambridge &amp; London, Macmillan &amp; Co.) vol. 2 (Appendix) page 113.&lt;/ref&gt;   The verses immediately before verse 24, the verse 24 itself, and the verses following verse 24 show many variations in the surviving manuscripts.  An abbreviated history of the passage is that the conclusion of the Epistle to the Romans was known in several different versions:  About the year 144, [[Marcion]]  made radical changes in the ending of the Epistle to the Romans, breaking it off with chapter 14.  At about the same time someone else made in other manuscripts the addition of verses 16:24 and 16:25-27. despite the existence of a concluding benediction at 16:20 (whose purpose was obscured by the greetings appended at 16:21-23).  This resulted in a proliferation of readings (at least 15 different permutations among the surviving resources).&lt;ref&gt;Kurt Aland and Barbara Aland, ''The Text of The New Testament'' (rev. ed. 1989, Grand Rapids, Mich., Eerdmans) pages 295-296.&lt;/ref&gt;  Because of its absence from the oldest sources and the confusion about its appearance in several of the sources containing it, its omission after verse 23 got a UBS confidence rating of B. &lt;ref&gt;[[Bruce M. Metzger]], ''A Textual Commentary on the Greek New Testament A Companion Volume to the UBS Greek New Testament (1971, United Bible Societies) loc.cit.; Lincoln H. Blumell, ''A Text-critical comparison of the King James New Testament with certain modern translations'', Studies in the Bible and Antiquity, vol. 3 (2011) pages 118-119.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== (16) First John 5:7-8 ===
{{main|Comma Johanneum}}

'''KJV:''' &lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; ''For there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the holy Ghost, and these three are one.''

&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; ''And there are three that bear witness in earth, ...''

'''Reason:''' A multitude of books have been devoted to just this verse, including: ''A Vindication of I John V, 7 from the Objections of M. Griesbach'' [by Thomas Burgess] (1821, London); ''Das Comma Ioanneum: Auf Seine Hewrkunft Untersucht'' [The Johannine Comma, an examination of its origin] by Karl Künstle (1905, Frieburg, Switz.); ''Letters to Mr. Archdeacon [George] Travis in answer to his Defence of the Three Heavenly Witnesses'' by [[Richard Porson]] (1790, London); ''A New Plea for the Authenticity of the Text of the Three Heavenly Witnesses or Porson's Letters to Travis Eclectically Examined'' by Rev. Charles Forster (1867, London), ''Memoir of The Controversy respecting the Three Heavenly Witnesses, I John V.7'' ˈ by 'Criticus' [Rev. William Orme] (1830, London), reprinted (1872, Boston, "a new edition, with notes and an appendix by [[Ezra Abbot]]" ); and ''The Three Witnesses - the disputed text in St. John, considerations new and old'' by Henry T. Armfield (1893, London); and many more.&lt;ref&gt;A list of 46 "Treatises on the genuineness of the disputed clause in I John V.7,8" appears in "An Introduction to the Critical Study and Knowledge of the Holy Scriptures" by [[Thomas Hartwell Horne]] (2nd ed. 1836, Philadelphia) vol. 2, Part II, Chap. III, page 80-83.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eberhard Nestle]], writing in Germany at the end of 19th century, said, "The fact that it [the Comma Johanneum] is still defended even from the Protestant side is interesting only from a pathological point of view."&lt;ref&gt;Eberhard Nestle, ''Introduction to the Textual Criticism of the Greek New Testament'' (transl. by William Edie from the 2nd ed. [1899, Gottingen, page 260]) (1901, London) page 327.&lt;/ref&gt; F.H.A. Scrivener, usually regarded as a defender of the KJV text, said of this verse, "The authenticity of [this verse] will, perhaps, no longer be maintained by anyone whose judgment ought to have weight; but this result has been arrived at after a long and memorable controversy, which helped keep alive, especially in England, some interest in Biblical studies. ...."&lt;ref&gt;[[Frederick Henry [Ambrose] Scrivener]], ''A Plain Introduction to the Criticism of the New Testament'' (3d ed. 1883, London) page 648.&lt;/ref&gt;

Early Church Fathers did not mention this verse, even when eagerly scraping together verses to support the Doctrine of the Trinity.&lt;ref&gt;[[Frederick Henry [Ambrose] Scrivener]], ''A Plain Introduction to the Criticism of the New Testament'' (3d ed. 1883, London) page 651.&lt;/ref&gt;
This verse first appears, not in a New Testament manuscript, but in a fifth century Confession of Faith, and after that it was assimilated into mss of the Latin Vulgate, but it was (because of the lack of Greek documentary support) omitted from the first two "[[Textus Receptus]]" printed editions of the New Testament (namely those edited by [[Erasmus]], 1516 and 1519),&lt;ref&gt;[[Andrew Dickson White]], ''A History of the Warfare of Science with Theology'' (1896, NY, Appleton) vol. 2, page 304; Henk Jan de Jonge, ''Erasmus and the Comma Johanneum'', Ephermerides Theologicae Lovanienses, vol. 56, nr. 4 (1980) page 381; Margalit Finkelberg, ''The Original versus the Received Text with Special Emphasis on the case of the Comma Johanneum'', International Journal of Classical Tradition, vol. 21, nr. 3 (Oct. 2014) pages 192-194 (with quotations from Erasmus's notes); Bruce M. Metzger, ''A Textual Commentary on the Greek New Testament A Companion Volume to the UBS Greek New Testament'' (1971, United Bible Societies) loc.cit.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as some other very early Textus Receptus editions, such as Aldus 1518, Gerbelius 1521, Cephalius 1524 and 1526, and Colinaeus 1534.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sir Isaac Newton]], ''Two Letters of Sir Isaac Newton to Mr. [Jean] Le Clerc" (1754 London) page 44.&lt;/ref&gt; Stephanus ([[Robert Estienne]]) , in his influential ''Editio Regia'' of 1550 (which was the model edition of the Textus Receptus in England),&lt;ref&gt;Kurt Aland &amp; Barbara Aland, ''The Text of The New Testament'' (rev. ed. 1987, Grand Rapids, Eerdmans) page 6.&lt;/ref&gt; was the first to provide an apparatus showing variant readings and showed this verse was lacking in seven Greek manuscripts.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sir Isaac Newton]], ''Two Letters of Sir Isaac Newton to Mr. [Jean] Le Clerc" (1754 London) page 46.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Martin Luther]] rejected this verse as a forgery and excluded it from his German translation of the Bible while he lived - it was inserted into the text by other hands after his death.&lt;ref&gt;Criticus, ''Memoir ...'', op.cit. page 42; [[Andrew Dickson White]], ''A History of the Warfare of Science with Theology'' (1896, NY, Appleton) vol. 2, page 304.&lt;/ref&gt; The first appearance of the Comma in a Greek New Testament manuscript is no earlier than the 15th century.&lt;ref&gt;Margalit Finkelberg, ''The Original versus the Received Text with Special Emphasis on the case of the Comma Johanneum'', International Journal of Classical Tradition, vol. 21, nr. 3 (Oct. 2014) page 193; Bruce M. Metzger, ''A Textual Commentary on the Greek New Testament A Companion Volume to the UBS Greek New Testament'' (1971, United Bible Societies) loc.cit.&lt;/ref&gt;

Doubts about its genuineness were indicated in printed Greek New Testaments as early as that of the first two editions (1515 &amp; 1519) of [[Erasmus of Rotterdam]], who simply left the verse out because he could not find a Greek ms containing it - and provided a comment that "this is all I find in the Greek manuscript".&lt;ref&gt;Margalit Finkelberg, ''The Original versus the Received Text with Special Emphasis on the Case of the Comma Johanneum'', International Jl. of the Classical Tradition, vol. 21, nr.  3 (Oct. 2014) page 193 (citing Erasmus, ''Novum Instrumentum Omne'', 1st ed., 1516, page 618).  And when Erasmus added the verse because it appeared in a suspiciously recent Greek ms, he added the note, "we have transferred from a British manuscript what had been said to be missing in our manuscripts .... Yet I suspect that it is corrected against our manuscripts." op.cit., page 194 (quoting ''Erasmi Roterdami in Novum Testamentum ab eodem tertio recignitum Annotationes'', 1511, Basel).&lt;/ref&gt; Expressions of doubt also appeared in the edition of Stephen Courcelles ([[Étienne de Courcelles]]), in 1658, and from [[Johann Jakob Griesbach]]'s edition of 1775.  Most critical editions relegated the Comma to a footnote or otherwise marked it as doubtful.&lt;ref&gt;Eduardus Reuss, ''Bibliotheca Novi Testamenti Graeci'' (1872, Brunswick) pages 130, 197 and following.  See also, [[Frederick Cornwallis Conybeare]], ''History of New Testament Criticism'' (1910, NY, Knickerbocker Press) pages 91-98.&lt;/ref&gt; The American Bible Union.&lt;ref&gt;Bible editions of the American Bible Union, [http://www.bible-researcher.com/abu.html].&lt;/ref&gt; a Baptist organization, omitted this verse from the new English translations of the New Testament it published in the 1860s.  The Roman Catholic Church was a bit more resistant about yielding up this verse; an 1897 decision of the Holy Inquisition forbade a Catholic "to deny or even express doubt about the authenticity of" the Johannine Comma, but this was effectively reversed by a declaration of the Holy Office on June 2, 1927, which allows scholars to express doubts and even denials of the genuineness of the Comma, tempered by the fact that the Vatican would have the final authority.&lt;ref&gt;Pontificae Commissionis de re Biblica Edita, ''Enchiridon Biblicum'' (11961, Rome) page 63, sections 135-136; [[Caspar René Gregory]], ''Critical Note: I John 5:7,8'', American Jl. of Theology, vol. 11, nr. 1 (Jan. 1907) page 131.&lt;/ref&gt; and, e.g., the 1966 [[Jerusalem Bible]] omits the Comma without a footnote. The spurious nature of this verse is so notorious&lt;ref&gt;[[Caspar René Gregory]], ''Critical Note: I John 5:7,8'', American Jl. of Theology, vol. 11, nr. 1 (Jan. 1907) page 131, ".... the spurious character of which is beyond doubt ...."&lt;/ref&gt; that even the Revised Version of 1881 did not bother to include nor provide a footnote for this verse, and many other modern versions do likewise. Ezra Abbot wrote, "It may be said that the question [of excluding this verse] is obsolete; that the spuriousness of the disputed passage had long been conceded by all intelligent and fair-minded scholars. This is true, but a little investigation will show that great ignorance still exists on the subject among the less-informed in the Christian community."&lt;ref&gt;Criticus, ''Memoir ...'', op.cit., page iv.&lt;/ref&gt; Even the two leading editions of the so-called [[Byzantine text-type|Majority Text]] (Robinson &amp; Pierpont, and Hodges &amp; Farstad) omit this verse (the Hodges &amp; Farstad edition acknowledge the 'Textus Receptus' version of this verse in a footnote).

== Some other omitted verses ==

=== Mark 6:11 (''b'') ===

'''KJV:''' &lt;sub&gt;6:11&lt;/sub&gt; And whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear you, when ye depart thence, shake off the

dust under your feet, for a testimony against them:  &amp;nbsp; '''Verily I say unto you, it shall be more

'''tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrha in the Day of Judgement, than for that city.'''  &amp;nbsp; &lt;sub&gt;6:12&lt;/sub&gt; And they

went out, and preached ...

'''RV:''' (omits the emphasized words, without a footnote).

'''Reason:''' Many (perhaps most) modern versions emulate the Revised Version and simply omit the sentence in question, without any explanatory comment.  This is a complete sentence and yet it did not receive, in the Textus Receptus editions, a verse number of its own.  It does not appear here in the majority of important codices, such as א,B,C,D,L,W,Δ,Θ, and Latin, Sahidic, and some Syriac and Boharic manuscripts.  It does, however, appear in some significant manuscripts, including ƒ&lt;sup&gt;1,13&lt;/sup&gt;, A, two very old Latin manuscripts, and some Syriac and Boharic manuscripts, and with slight differences in minuscule 33 (9th century).  It was already doubted even before the KJV; this sentence does not appear in Wycliff (1380), the Bishops Bible (1568), and the Rheims (1582). Westcott and Hort omitted it and did not even mention it in their ''Appendix'' volume, nor is it mentioned in Scrivener's ''Plain Introduction to Criticism of the New Testament'', nor is it mentioned in Metzger's ''Commentary'', nor does it get even a footnote in the Souter or UBS Greek New Testament.  Henry Alford's edition of the New Testament includes this sentence in the main text, but bracketed and italicized, with the brief footnote: "omitted in most ancient authorities: probably inserted here from Matthew 10:15." &lt;ref&gt;[[Henry Alford]], ''The New Testament for English Readers'' (1863, London) vol. 1, part i, loc.cit.&lt;/ref&gt; The same two sentences do appear, without any quibbling about their authenticity, in Matthew 10:14-15, and it is plausible that some very early copyist assimilated the sentence into Mark, perhaps as a sidenote subsequently copied into the main text.  In any case, its omission from Mark 6:11 does not effect its unchallenged presence in Matthew 10:15.

=== Luke 4:8 (''b'') ===

'''KJV:'''  "And Jesus answered and said unto to him [the Devil],  &amp;nbsp;  ' '''Get thee behind me, Satan, for'''  &amp;nbsp; it is written, ........'

'''RV:''' (omits the emphasized words, without a footnote).

'''Reason:'''  The emphasized words, although by now a very familiar quotation, are omitted from the RV and most other modern versions; it was also omitted by the Wycliffe (1380) and Rheims (1582) versions.  This clause is not found in א,B,D,L,W,Ξ, ƒ&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, several cursives, and Latin, Sahidic, and many Syriac and Boharic mss.  It is present in A,Θ,Ψ,ƒ&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;, and some Italic mss.  It is believed probable that the clause was inserted here by assimilation because the corresponding version of this narrative, in Matthew, contains a somewhat similar rebuke to the Devil (in the KJV, "Get thee hence, Satan,"; Matthew 4:10, which is the way this rebuke reads in Luke 4:8 in the Tyndale [1534], Great Bible (also called the Cranmer Bible) [1539], and Geneva [1557] versions), whose authenticity is not disputed, and because the very same words are used in a different situation in Matthew 16:23 and Mark 8:33. The omission of this clause from Luke 4:8 in critical texts is so well-established that no comment about the omission appears in the Appendix to Westcott &amp; Hort, in Scrivener's Plain Introduction to Textual Criticism, or in the UBS New Testament.

=== Luke 23:17 ===

'''KJV:''' ''For of necessity he must release one unto them at the feast.''   &lt;br&gt;
(The '''TEV''', as a footnote, gave this as: ''At every Passover Festival Pilate had to set free one prisoner for them.'')

'''Reasons:'''   The same verse or a very similar verse appears (and is preserved) as Matthew 27:15 and as Mark 15:6.  This verse is suspected of having been assimilated into Luke at a very early date.  But it is missing from Luke in such early manuscripts as '''p'''&lt;sup&gt;75&lt;/sup&gt; (early Third century),A,B,K,L, the Sahidic version, a Bohairic ms, and an Italic ms.  On the other hand, it does appear in א,W,ƒ&lt;sup&gt;1, 13&lt;/sup&gt;, and some Syriac and Bohairic mss, which indicates that its assimilation into Luke had begun at a fairly early time. However, D, the Ethiopic version, and some Italic and Syriac mss put this verse after what is called verse 18, which may further indicate that it was an insertion rather than part of the authorial text.&lt;ref&gt;UBS loc.cit., Nestle-Aland loc.cit., Souter loc.cit.&lt;/ref&gt;   Moffatt characterized this verse as "an explanatory and harmonistic gloss." &lt;ref&gt;Moffatt, loc.cit., footnote.&lt;/ref&gt;  The verse in Luke does differ from the contexts of the similar verses at Matthew 27:15 and  Mark 15:6, where releasing a prisoner on Passover is a "habit" or "custom" of Pilate, and at John 18:39 is a custom of the Jews - but in its appearance in Luke it becomes a necessity for Pilate regardless of his habits or preferences, "to comply with a law which never existed." &lt;ref&gt;Paul Winter, ''A Letter from Pontius Pilate'', Novum Testamentum, vol. 7, nr. 1 (March 1964) page 42.&lt;/ref&gt; Aland lays stress on the differences among the Gospel accounts and says, "Even though א reads the insertion, the evidence for ... omission is stronger by far." &lt;ref&gt;Kurt Aland and Barbara Aland, ''The Text of The New Testament'' (rev. ed. 1989, Grand Rapids, Mich., Eerdmans) page 303.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Not omitted but boxed ==

There are two passages (both 12 verses long) that continue to appear in the main text of most of the modern versions, but distinguished in some way from the rest of the text, such as being enclosed in brackets or printed in different typeface or relegated to a footnote.  These are passages which are well supported by a wide variety of sources of great antiquity and yet there is strong reason to doubt that the words were part of the original text of the Gospels. &lt;!-- the citations are provided with the separate passages --&gt; In the words of [[Philip Schaff]], "According to the judgment of the best critics, these two important sections are additions to the original text from apostolic tradition."&lt;ref&gt;[[Philip Schaff]], ''A Companion to the Greek New Testament and the English Version'' (1883, NY, Harper &amp; Bros.) page 431.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mark 16:9–20 ===
{{main|Mark 16}}

'''KJV:''' ''&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt; Now when Jesus was risen early the first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, out of whom he had cast seven devils.

''&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; And she went and told them that had been with him, as they mourned and wept.

''&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt; And they, when they had heard that he was alive, and had been seen of her, believed not.

''&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; After that he appeared in another form unto two of them, as they walked, and went into the country.

''&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt; And they went and told it unto the residue: neither believed they them.

''&lt;sub&gt;14&lt;/sub&gt; Afterward he appeared unto the eleven as they sat at meat, and upbraided them with their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they believed not them which had seen him after he was risen.

''&lt;sub&gt;15&lt;/sub&gt; And he said unto them, Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature.

''&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt; He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned.

''&lt;sub&gt;17&lt;/sub&gt; And these signs shall follow them that believe; In my name shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues;

''&lt;sub&gt;18&lt;/sub&gt; They shall take up serpents;&lt;ref&gt;This verse - "''They shall take up serpents''" - has become controversial because it has become the proof-text of the sect of [[snake handling]] churches, begun around 1910 and found mostly in Appalachia.  But, oddly enough, although the Greek word here, αρούσίν (root: αίρω), usually means "to lift upward" or "to pick up", as it appears here in the KJV and virtually all subsequent translations, the pre-KJV English versions translated the same root as it is used in John 19:15 and Luke 23:18 and Acts 21:36 and elsewhere, in the sense of killing or removing (in the KJV translated as "Away with him").  Some Greek mss include the words "with their hands".  The opening words (in modernized spelling) of Mark 16:18 were translated in the Wycliffe version (1382 &amp; 1395) as "They shall do away [with] serpents", and in the Tyndale version (1525) as "shall kill serpents" (and similarly in Martin Luther's German version), and in the Coverdale version (1534), Great Bible (1539), and Bishops' Bible (1568) as "they shall drive away serpents", and in Geneva Bible (1560) and Rheims (1582) as "shall take away serpents".  The difference from the KJV's rendering seems significant.&lt;/ref&gt; and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover.

''&lt;sub&gt;19&lt;/sub&gt; So then after the Lord had spoken unto them, he was received up into heaven, and sat on the right hand of God.

''&lt;sub&gt;20&lt;/sub&gt; And they went forth, and preached every where, the Lord working with them, and confirming the word with signs following. Amen.''

The twelves verses shown in the KJV, called the "longer ending" of Mark, usually are retained&lt;ref&gt;One of the few exceptions is ''The Gospel according to St. Mark: Revised from the ancient Greek Mss. unknown to the translators of the Authorised Version'' (attributed to John Ivatt Briscoe)(1870, London, Longmans, Green &amp; Co.) in which the Gospel ends with verse 8, followed by a footnote quoting Dean Alford, who edited a critical edition of the Greek New Testament, to the effect that the familiar ending "probably was an addition placed here in very early times."&lt;/ref&gt; in modern versions, although sometimes separated from verse 8 by an extra space, or enclosed in brackets, or relegated to a footnote, and accompanied by a note to the effect that this ending is not found in the very oldest Greek mss but it is found in sources almost as old.

The RV of 1881 put an extra space between verse 8 and this verse 9 and included a marginal note to that effect, a practice followed by many subsequent English versions.  The RSV edition of 1947 ends its main text at verse 8 and then in a footnote provides this ending with the note that "other texts and versions" include it; but the revised RSV of 1971 and the NRSV reverted to the practice of the RV.

Although the Longer Ending appears in 99% of the surviving Greek mss and most ancient versions,&lt;ref&gt;Kurt Aland &amp; Barbara Aland, ''The Text of The New Testament'' (rev. ed. 1987, Grand Rapids, Eerdmans) page 292.&lt;/ref&gt; there is strong evidence, both external and internal, for concluding that it was not part of the original text of the Gospel.

The preceding portion of chapter 16 tells how Mary Magdalene and two other women came to the tomb, found it opened and Jesus's body missing, and were told by an angel to convey a message to Peter and the other disciples, but the women fled and said nothing to anyone because they were frightened.  The last words of verse 8 are, in Greek, έφοβούντο γάρ, usually translated "for they were afraid".  It is nowadays widely accepted that these are the last remaining verses written by St. Mark.&lt;ref&gt;Suzanne Watts Henderson,''Discipleship After the Resurrection: Scribal Hermeneutics in the Longer Ending of Mark'', Journal of Theological Studies, vol. 63ns, nr. 1 (April 2012) page 108.&lt;/ref&gt; The Gospel of St. Mark ends (somewhat abruptly) at end of verse 8 ("for they were afraid.") in א and B (both 4th century) and some much later Greek mss, a few mss of the ancient versions (Syriac, Coptic, Armenian), and is specifically mentioned in the writings of such Church Fathers as [[Eusebius]] and [[Jerome]] explicitly doubted the authenticity of the verses after verse 8, most other Church Fathers don't quote from this ending.  No papyrus contains any portion of the 12 verses.&lt;ref&gt;David Alan Black, "Mark 16:8 as the conclusion to the Second Gospel" in David Alan Black, ed., ''Perspectives on the Ending of Mark: 4 Views'' (2008, Nashville, Broadman &amp; Holman ) page 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, these 12 verses occur in slightly less ancient Greek mss, A,C,D,K,θ,ƒ&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;, and a "vast number" of others,&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;[[Bruce M. Metzger]], ''A Textual Commentary on the Greek New Testament A Companion Volume to the UBS Greek New Testament'' (1971, United Bible Societies) loc.cit.&lt;/ref&gt; and a great many mss of the ancient versions, and is quoted by some other Church Fathers, the earliest being Irenaeus (although his quotations are imprecise).&lt;ref&gt;Lincoln H. Blumell, "A Text-Critical Comparison of the King James New Testament with Certain Modern Translations", Studies in the Bible and Antiquity, vol.3, page 91.&lt;/ref&gt; So it would appear, initially, that the evidence was nearly in equipoise.

Yet other ancient sources include this longer ending - but mark it with asterisks or other signs or notations indicating the copyists had doubts about its authenticity, most notably ƒ&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; and several minuscules (all twelfth century or later), according to the UBS notes and Bruce Metzger.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Although this Longer Ending is of great antiquity, some early Church Fathers were familiar with mss that lacked it.  [[Eusebius]], in the first half of the fourth century, wrote, in response to a query from a man named Marinus, about how Matthew 28:1 conflicts with the Longer Ending on which day Jesus rose from the dead, with the comment, "He who is for getting rid of the entire passage [at the end of Mark] will say that it is not met with in ''all'' the copies of Mark's Gospel; the accurate copies, at all events, making the end of Mark's narrative come after the words ... '... for they were afraid.' [verse 8] For at those words, in almost all copies of the Gospel According to Mark, comes the end. What follows, which is met with seldom, [and only] in some copies, certainly not in all, might be dispensed with; especially if it should prove to contradict the record of the other Evangelists. This, then, is what a person will say who is for evading and entirely getting rid of a gratuitous problem." Eusebius goes on to try to reconcile the Longer Ending with the other Gospel accounts, if the Longer Ending were to be regarded as authentic.&lt;ref&gt;Quoting from a Greek mss found in 1825 by Cardinal Angelo Mai, as translated in John W. Burgon, ''The Last Twelve Verses of the Gospel According to S. Mark'' (1871, Oxford &amp; London) pages 44-45 (Burgon's emphasis). Also in Brooke Foss Westcott &amp; Fenton John Anthony Hort, ''The New Testament in the Original Greek'' (1881, Cambridge &amp; London, Macmillan &amp; Co.) vol. 2 (Appendix) pages 31-32, which reproduces the Greek text; also Claudio Zamagni, ''L'état canonique du texte face à ses variantes: Eusèbe et Mc 16:9-20'', Adamantius, vol. 11 (2005) page 133.&lt;/ref&gt; St. [[Jerome]], in the first half of the fifth century, received a very similar query from a lady named Hedibia and responded, "Either we should reject the testimony of Mark, which is met with in scarcely any copies of the Gospel, - almost all the Greek codices being without this passage, - especially since it seems to narrate what contradicts the other Gospels; - or else, we shall reply that both Evangelists state what is true."&lt;ref&gt;As translated in John W. Burgon, ''The Last Twelve Verses of the Gospel According to S. Mark'' (1871, Oxford &amp; London) page 53. Also in Brooke Foss Westcott &amp; Fenton John Anthony Hort, ''The New Testament in the Original Greek'' (1881, Cambridge &amp; London, Macmillan &amp; Co.) vol. 2 (Appendix) pages 33-34, which reproduces the Latin text.&lt;/ref&gt; This might be thought an authoritative statement but Jerome compromised it by including the Longer Ending, without any apparent notation about doubting it, in his Latin Vulgate, and Burgon (among others) thinks this inclusion is an endorsement of its authenticity.&lt;ref&gt;John W. Burgon, ''The Last Twelve Verses of the Gospel According to S. Mark'' (1871, Oxford &amp; London) pages 54.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested or suspected that Jerome's expression of doubt was actually a rehash of the similar comment by Eusebius,&lt;ref&gt;John W. Burgon, ''The Last Twelve Verses of the Gospel According to S. Mark'' (1871, Oxford &amp; London) pages 54-56; .also Brooke Foss Westcott &amp; Fenton John Anthony Hort, ''The New Testament in the Original Greek'' (1881, Cambridge &amp; London, Macmillan &amp; Co.) vol. 2 (Appendix) page 33.&lt;/ref&gt; but, to the contrary, it is possible that Jerome was unaware of this particular opinion of Eusebius, considering that it was utterly unknown to modern scholars until its fortuitous discovery in 1825. Burgon also found a patristic comment previously attributed to Gregory of Nyssa (of the late fourth century), but which he suspected was more likely written by Hesychius of Jerusalem (middle of the fifth century) or Severus of Antioch (middle sixth century), again answering the same sort of query, and saying, "In the more accurate copies, the Gospel according to Mark has its end at 'for they were afraid.' In some copies, however, this also is added - 'Now when He was risen early [on] the first day of the week, He appeared first to Mary Magdalene ....'." In this instance Gregory of Nyssa (or Hesychius or Severus) goes on to eliminate the problem by suggesting the imposition of punctuation different from that used in any of the Greek manuscripts (the earliest had no punctuation at all, the later mss had little more than commas and periods) or in the KJV, to make the first verse of the Longer Ending appear to be "Now when He was risen''':''' Early on the first day of the week He appeared first to Mary Magdalene ....." In other words, that Jesus had risen presumably at the end of the Sabbath, as suggested in the other Gospels, but He did not appear to Mary Magdalene until the next day.&lt;ref&gt;John W. Burgon, ''The Last Twelve Verses of the Gospel According to S. Mark'' (1871, Oxford &amp; London) pages 57-58. Also in Brooke Foss Westcott &amp; Fenton John Anthony Hort, ''The New Testament in the Original Greek'' (1881, Cambridge &amp; London, Macmillan &amp; Co.) vol. 2 (Appendix) page 34, also supporting the attribution to either Hesychius or Severus rather than Gregory.&lt;/ref&gt;

Actually, [[Codex Washingtonianus|Greek codex W]] (also known as the Freer Gospels or the Codex Washingtonianus), dating from the fourth or fifth century, is the oldest known Greek ms that sets forth the Longer Ending&lt;ref&gt;Albert J. Edmunds, ''The Text of the Resurrection in Mark, and its Testimony to the Apparitional Theory'', The Monist, vol. 27, nr. 2 (April 1917) page 171.&lt;/ref&gt; and it contains a lengthy addition (which appears nowhere else), known as the Freer Logion, between the familiar verses 14 and 15.&lt;ref&gt;A photograph of this page of the Codex W appears in [[Kurt Aland]] &amp; Barbara Aland, ''The Text of The New Testament'' (rev.ed. 1989, Grand Rapids, Mich., Eerdmans) page 114. See also, [[Caspar René Gregory]], ''Das Freer-Logion'' (1908 Leipzig, JC Hinrichs); and Clarence Russell Williams, ''The Appendices to the Gospel according to Mark: A Study in Textual Transmission'' (1915, Yale Univ. Press)(originally published as part of volume 18, Feb. 1915, of the Transactions of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences) pages 419-422.  It appears that St. [[Jerome]] saw this addition, and possibly in several mss, because he wrote (ca. 415, in ''Contra Pelaginos''. 2:15), "In some copies, and especially in Greek codices, according to Mark at the end of his Gospel it is written: Afterward, when the eleven had reclined, Jesus appeared to them, and rebuked their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they did not believe those who had seen him risen. And they apologized saying, 'This age of iniquity and unbelief is substance [''substantia;'' one MS reads ''sub Satana,''- under Satan], which does not permit the true worth [''virtutem''] of God to be apprehended through unclean spirits." translated (with the bracketed comments) by [[Edgar J. Goodspeed]], ''The Detroit Manuscripts of the Septuagint and New Testament'', The Biblical World, vol. 31, nr. 3 (March 1908) page 225. Goodspeed theorized that Jerome had seen these mss at the Nitrian monasteries at Alexandria, Egypt, which he visited in 386. Goodspeed, ''The Freer Gospels and Shenute of Atripe'', The Biblical World, vol. 33, nr. 3 (March 1909) page 206, and Goodspeed, ''Notes on the Freer Gospels'', American Journal of Theology, vol. 13, nr. 4 (Oct. 1909) pages 602-603.  Curiously, although Goodspeed paid special attention to Codex W, - as shown in [[Edgar J. Goodspeed]], ''The Freer Gospels'', Historical and Linguistic Studies in Literature Related to the New Testament, first series, volume II, part 3 (1914, Chicago, Univ. of Chicago Press) 65 pages - he did not make any mention of the Freer Logion in his own translation of the New Testament.&lt;/ref&gt; The addition in Codex W is included in [[James Moffatt]]'s 1935 translation, with a note indicating Moffatt's belief&lt;ref&gt;A belief apparently not shared by anyone else: "No one maintains that this rather florid passage belongs to the original Mark not ever to the original form of the long ending of the Textus Receptus." Archibald T. Robertson, ''Studies in Mark's Gospel'' (1919, NY, Macmillan Co.) page 133.&lt;/ref&gt; that it was part of the original text of the longer ending "but was excised for some reason at an early date." It was not included in the RSV, but is set forth in a footnote to verse 14 in the NRSV with the comment that "other ancient authorities [''sic plural''] add, in whole or part".
The addition, as translated by '''Moffatt:'''

''But they excused themselves saying, "This age of lawlessness and unbelief lies under the sway of Satan,

''who will not allow what lies under the unclean spirits to understand the truth and power of God;

''therefore," they said to Christ, "reveal your righteousness now."

''Christ answered them, "The term of years for Satan's power has now expired, but other terrors are at hand.

''I was delivered to death on behalf of sinners, that they might return to the truth and sin no more,

''that they might inherit that glory of righteousness which is spiritual and imperishable in heaven."''

In 1891, [[Frederick Cornwallis Conybeare]], while collating several ancient Armenian manuscripts in the library of the monastery at Ećmiadzin, at the foot of Mount Ararat, in what is now Turkey, found a uncial codex written in the year 986, bound with ivory front and back covers. As Conybeare described it:&lt;ref&gt;F.C. Conybeare, ''Aristion, the Author of the Last Twelve Verses of Mark'', The Expositor, 4th series, vol. 8 (Oct. 1893) page 243. Also,Clarence Russell Williams, ''The Appendices to the Gospel according to Mark: A Study in Textual Transmission'' (1915, Yale Univ. Press)(originally published as part of volume 18, Feb. 1915, of the Transactions of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences) pages 379-383. A photo of this ms page appears in [[Henry Barclay Swete]], ''The Gospel according to St. Mark'' (1913, London, Macmillan &amp; Co.) opposite page cxi.&lt;/ref&gt; "Now in this codex the Gospel of Mark is copied out as far as έφοβούντο γάρ [i.e., the end of 16:8]. Then a space of two lines is left, after which, in the same uncial hand, only in red, is written "Ariston Eritzou." which means "Of the Presbyter Ariston." This title occupies one whole line (the book is written in double columns) and then follow the last twelve verses [i.e., the Longer Ending] still in the same hand. They begin near the bottom of the second column of a verse, and are continued on the recto of the next folio." The text in this Armenian codex is a literal translation of the Longer Ending from the Greek mss.&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin W. Bacon, '' Ariston (Aristo)'', in James Hastings, ed., ''A Dictionary of Christ and the Gospels'' (1906, Edinburgh, T &amp; T Clark) vol. 2, page 118 col. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, the Longer Ending was attributed, in this tenth century Armenian codex, to a "Presbyter Ariston".  Conybeare theorized that Ariston was the Armenian version of the Greek name Aristion.  Of a number of Aristions known to history, Conybeare favored the Aristion who had traveled with the original Disciples and was known to [[Papias of Hierapolis|Papias]], a famous Bishop of the early 2nd century; a quotation from Papias, mentioning Aristion as a Disciple, is found in the ''[[Church History (Eusebius)|Historia Ecclesiastica]]'' of [[Eusebius]], 3:39:4.&lt;ref&gt;F.C. Conybeare, ''Aristion, the Author of the Last Twelve Verses of Mark'', The Expositor, 4th series, vol. 8 (Oct. 1893) page 245.&lt;/ref&gt; Other candidates includes an [[Aristo of Pella]], who flourished around the year 140, also mentioned by Eusebius in the ''Historia Ecclesiastica'', 4:6:3, favored by Alfred Resch,&lt;ref&gt;Alfred Resch, ''Ausser-Canonische Paralleltexte zu den Evangelien'', transl. F.C. Conybeare, ''The Authorship of the Last Verses of Mark'', Expositor, series 4, vol. 10 (Sept 1894) page 228.&lt;/ref&gt; but Conybeare considered him too late to have written the Longer Ending in time for it to have achieved its widespread acceptance.&lt;ref&gt;F.C. Conybeare, ''Aristion, the Author of the Last Twelve Verses of Mark'', The Expositor, 4th series, vol. 8 (Oct. 1893) page 243; Theodor Zahn, letter in ''Theologische Literaturblatt'' (Leipzig, Dec. 22, 1893, transl. F.C. Conybeare, ''The Authorship of the Last Verses of Mark'', Expositor, series 4, vol. 10 (Sept 1894) page 222; [[James Moffatt]], ''An Introduction to the Literature of the New Testament'' (1911, NY, Charles Scribner's Sons) page 241.&lt;/ref&gt; An examination of 220 Armenian mss of Mark showed that 88 contained the Longer Ending as a regular part of the text, 99 stop at verse 8, and 33 contained the Longer Ending as a subsequent insertion into the mss.&lt;ref&gt;Ernest Cadman Colwell, ''Mark 16:9-20 in the Armenian Version'', Journal of Biblical Literature, vol. 56, nr. 4 (Dec. 1937) page 369; also Allen Wikgren, ''Armenian Gospel Materials in the Kurdian Collection'', Journal of Biblical Literature, vol. 59, nr. 1 (March 1940) page 53.&lt;/ref&gt; It may be significant that where the Armenian mss do reproduce the Longer Ending, some have conspicuous variants from the Greek version,&lt;ref&gt;Ernest Cadman Colwell, ''Mark 16:9-20 in the Armenian Version'', Journal of Biblical Literature, vol. 56, nr. 4 (Dec. 1937) pages 380-381.&lt;/ref&gt; and a few Armenian mss put the Longer Ending elsewhere than at the end of Mark - of the 220 Armenian mss studied, two put the Longer Ending at the end of the Gospel of John, and puts it at the end of Luke, and one ms has the Longer Ending at the end of Mark and the Shorter Ending at the end of the Gospel of Luke.&lt;ref&gt;Ernest Cadman Colwell, ''Mark 16:9-20 in the Armenian Version'', Journal of Biblical Literature, vol. 56, nr. 4 (Dec. 1937) pages 378-379.&lt;/ref&gt; Even into the 17th century, some Armenian copyists were omitting the Longer Ending or including it with a note doubting its genuineness.&lt;ref&gt;Ernest Cadman Colwell, ''Mark 16:9-20 in the Armenian Version'', Journal of Biblical Literature, vol. 56, nr. 4 (Dec. 1937) page 378.&lt;/ref&gt;

But this situation is a bit more complicated.  Some other ancient sources have an entirely different ending to Mark, after verse 8, known as the "Shorter Ending". The RV of 1881 contained a footnote attesting to the existence of this Shorter Ending but its text did not appear in a popular edition of the Bible until somewhat later.&lt;ref&gt;Apparently the first English version that set forth this shorter ending is ''The Twentieth Century New Testament'' (attributed to "a company of about twenty scholars")(1901 &amp; rev. 1904, NY, Fleming H. Revell Co.), loc. cit.  In the 1901 edition the Shorter Ending, captioned "A Late Appendix", appeared before the longer ending, captioned "Another Appendix", but in the 1904 revised edition this order was switched.&lt;/ref&gt; It appeared in the footnote at this place in the RSV and then in brackets in the main text of the NRSV:

'''RSV &amp; NRSV:''' ''But they reported briefly to Peter and those with him all that they had been told.

'' After this, Jesus himself sent out by means of them,

'' from east to west, the sacred and imperishable proclamation of eternal salvation.''

This Shorter Ending appears, by itself, after verse 8, in only one ms, an Italic ms (Codex Bobbiensis, "k"), of the 4th or 5th century. But there are a handful of other sources that contain the Shorter Ending then add the longer ending after it.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The Shorter Ending is found in Greek in Fragment Sinaiticum ("0112") (7th century), Fragment Parisiense ("099") (8th cent.), Codex Regius ("L") (8th cent.) and Codex Athous Laurae ("Ψ") (8th or 9th century); in the first three it is preceded with a copyist's note about being found in only some mss, in Ψ it follows verse 8 without such a note, and in all four the Shorter Ending is followed by the Longer Ending.&lt;ref&gt;Alfred Plummer, ''The Gospel according to St. Mark'' (of the Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges series, edited by R. St. John Parry)(1915, Cambridge, Univ. Press) page xxxix-xl. The RSV and NRSV do not translate an "Amen" that appears in the text of Bobbiensis and Codex Ψ and several other mss. To be precise, in MS 579, a Greek ms of the 13th century, the Longer Ending is followed by the Shorter Ending - but a marginal note by a copyist says the Shorter Ending should have appeared first. David Alan Black, "Mark 16:8 as the conclusion to the Second Gospel" in David Alan Black, ed., ''Perspectives on the Ending of Mark: 4 Views'' (2008, Nashville, Broadman &amp; Holman) page 25.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also reported to appear similarly (first shorter, then longer ending) in some ancient versions.  Wherever the Shorter Ending appears, even when combined with the Longer Ending, there is some separation in the text (decoration or a copyist's notation) immediately after verse 8; the only exception being Codex Ψ, which treats the Shorter Ending as the proper continuation after verse 8 - but then inserts a copyist's note before providing the Longer Ending.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Barclay Swete, ''The Gospel according to St. Mark'' (1913, London, Macmillan &amp; Co.) page cvii.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result, there are five possible endings to the Gospel of Mark: (1) An abrupt ending at end of verse 8; (2) the Longer Ending following verse 8; (3) the Longer Ending including the "Freer Logion"; (4) the Shorter Ending following verse 8; and (5) the Shorter and Longer endings combined (and we could add as a sixth possible ending, anything after verse 8 enclosed in brackets or otherwise distinguished with indicia of doubt).&lt;ref&gt;Paul L. Danove, ''The End of Mark's Story: A methodological study'' (1993, Leiden, E.J. Brill) page 120.&lt;/ref&gt;

It would appear that the longer ending does not fit precisely with the preceding portion of chapter 16.  For example, verse 9 says Jesus appeared to Mary Magdalene on "the first day of the week", yet verse 2 said that same day Mary Magdalene did not see Jesus.  Perhaps more significantly, verse 9 finds it necessary to identify Mary Magdalene as the woman who had been freed of seven demons, as if she had not been named before, yet she was mentioned without that detail being mentioned in 15:47 and 16:1.&lt;ref&gt;J.C. du Buisson, ''The Origin and Peculiar Characteristics of the Gospel of S. Mark and its Relation to the Synoptists, being the Ellerton Essay, 1896'' (1896, Oxford, Clarendon Press) page 39; Henry Barclay Swete, ''The Gospel according to St. Mark'' (1913, London, Macmillan &amp; Co.) pages cx and 399 ("She is introduced to the reader as if she not been mentioned before"); also Travis B. Williams, ''Bringing Method to the Madness: Examining the Style of the Longer Ending of Mark'', Bulletin for Biblical Research, vol. 20, nr. 3 (2010) page 410 ("the description of Mary Magdalene is an important indicator of inauthenticity in this verse").&lt;/ref&gt; Verse 9 in Greek does not mention Jesus by name or title, but only says "Having arisen ... he appeared ..." (the KJV's inclusion of the name Jesus was an editorial emendation as indicated by the use of italic typeface) - and, in fact, Jesus is not expressly named until verses 19 and 20 ("the Lord" in both verses); a lengthy use of a pronoun without identification.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Additionally, the style and vocabulary of the longer ending appear not to be in the same style as the rest of the Gospel. The Greek text used by the KJV translators is 166 words long, using a vocabulary of (very approximately) 140 words.&lt;ref&gt;Using the text in [[Frederick Henry Ambrose Scrivener]], ''The New Testament in the Original Greek according to the text followed in The Authorised Version'' (1881, Cambridge, Univ. Press) loc.cit.; the 166th word, "Amen", according to the Appendix of this edition (page 649), did not appear in all Textus Receptus editions - it appeared in the Complutensian, Colineaeus, the first three editions of Stephanus, and the first edition of Beza, while the "Amen" was lacking in the editions of Erasmus, the fourth edition of Stephanus, Beza's editions after his first, the Clementine edition of the Latin Vulgate, and Tyndal's English.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, out of that small number, 16 words do not appear elsewhere in the Gospel of Mark, 5 words are used here in a different way than used elsewhere in Mark, and 4 phrases do not appear elsewhere in Mark.&lt;ref&gt;Paul L. Danove, ''The End of Mark's Story: A methodological study'' (1993, Leiden, E.J. Brill) pages 122-124; also Travis B. Williams, ''Bringing Method to the Madness: Examining the Style of the Longer Ending of Mark'', Bulletin for Biblical Research, vol. 20, nr. 3 (2010) pages 405-409 (additionally there are peculiarities in Greek grammar and usage, which are difficult to explain in English); also Ezra P. Gould, ''A Critical and Exegetical Commentary on the Gospel According to St. Mark: The International Critical Commentary'' (1896, NY, Scribners) page 302.&lt;/ref&gt; The shorter ending, in Greek, is approximately (depending on the variants) 32 words long,&lt;ref&gt;Using the UBS edition.&lt;/ref&gt; of which 7 words do not appear elsewhere in Mark.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The Freer Logion consists of 89 words,&lt;ref&gt;Using the UBS edition in the footnote to verse 14.&lt;/ref&gt; of which 8 words do not appear elsewhere in Mark.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Paul L. Danove, ''The End of Mark's Story: A methodological study'' (1993, Leiden, E.J. Brill) page 124.&lt;/ref&gt; The stylistic differences suggest that none of these was written by the author of the Gospel of St. Mark.  Metzger speaks of the "inconcinnities" [''sic''] between the first 8 verses of chapter 16 and the longer ending, and suggests, "all these features indicate that the section was added by someone who knew a form of Mark that ended abruptly with verse 8 and who wished to supply a more appropriate conclusion."&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;[[Bruce M. Metzger]], ''A Textual Commentary on the Greek New Testament A Companion Volume to the UBS Greek New Testament'' (1971, United Bible Societies) loc.cit, page 125.&lt;/ref&gt; Plummer puts it very strongly, "The twelve verses not only do not belong to Mark, they quite clearly belong to some other document. While Mark has no proper ending, these verses have no proper beginning. ... Not only does verse 9 not fit onto verse 8, but the texture of what follows is quite different from the texture of what precedes. A piece torn from a bit of satin is appended to the torn end of roll of homespun."&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Alfred Plummer, ''The Gospel according to St. Mark" (of the Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges series, edited by R. St. John Parry)(1915, Cambridge, Univ. Press) page xliii.&lt;/ref&gt;

The preceding verse, verse 16:8. ends abruptly.  Although the KJV and most English translations render this as the end of a complete sentence ("for they were afraid."), the Greek words έφοβούντο γάρ suggest that the sentence is incomplete.  The word γάρ is a sort of conjunction and rarely occurs at the end of a sentence.&lt;ref&gt;P.W. van der Horst, ''Can a Book End with ΓΑΡ?

This is also reflected in the rendering of this verse as an unfinished sentence in ''The Bible in Basic English'', namely "... because they were full of fear that - - -.", and in the ''Moffatt Bible'', namely "... for they were afraid of - - -."&lt;/ref&gt; The attachment of neither the Longer nor Shorter Ending (nor both of them) smooth this "ragged edge to an imperfect document."&lt;ref&gt;Alfred Plummer, ''The Gospel according to St. Mark" (of the Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges series, edited by R. St. John Parry)(1915, Cambridge, Univ. Press) pages xliii and 200; also, Morton S. Enslin, ''έφοβούντο γάρ, Mark 16,8'', Journal of Biblical Literature, vol 16, nr. 1/2 (1927) page 66, "Finally, when attempts were made to complete the gospel there is no evidence that any effort was made to smooth out the barbarism of a γάρ concluding a paragraph."&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a problem with the narrative; verses 6 and 7, whose genuineness is undoubted, says that Jesus is "not here" (in Jerusalem) but will appear to them and the disciples in Galilee. The Shorter Ending does not contradict this, but the Longer Ending, in verse 9, immediately contradicts this by having Jesus appear to Mary Magdalene while in Jerusalem, and in verse 12 to two disciples apparently not yet in Galilee. This inconsistency has been considered significant by some.&lt;ref&gt;Ezra P. Gould, ''A Critical and Exegetical Commentary on the Gospel According to St. Mark: The International Critical Commentary'' (1896, NY, Scribners) pages 304-306; also Benjamin Wisner Bacon, ''The Gospel of Mark, its composition and date'' (1925, Yale Univ. Press) pages 188-190.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the Longer Ending was included, without any indication of doubt, as part of chapter 16 of the Gospel of St. Mark in the various Textus Receptus editions, the editor of the first published Textus Receptus edition, namely [[Erasmus of Rotterdam]], discovered (evidently after his fifth and final edition of 1535) that the Codex Vaticanus ended the Gospel at verse 8, whereupon he mentioned doubts about the Longer Ending in a manuscript which lay unpublished until modern times.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;James A. Kelhoffer, ''Miracle and Mission: The Authentication of Missionaries and Their Message in the Longer Ending of Mark'' (2000, Tubingen, Germany, Mohr Siebeck) page 7.&lt;/ref&gt; The omission of the Longer Ending in the Codex Vaticanus apparently was not realized again until rediscovered in 1801 by the Danish scholar Andreas Birch (whose discovery got very little publicity owing to a fire that destroyed his newly published book before it could be much distributed).&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; After that, the omission was again rediscovered by Johann Jakob Griesbach, and was reflected in his third edition (1803) of the Greek New Testament, where he ended the Gospel at verse 8 and separated the Longer Ending and enclosed it in brackets,&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; very much as most modern editions of the Greek text and most modern English versions continue to do.

A commonly accepted theory for the condition of the last chapter of the Gospel of Mark is that the words actually written by St. Mark end, somewhat abruptly, with verse 8.  This abrupt ending may have been a deliberate choice of St. Mark or because the last part of his writing (after verse 8) was somehow separated from the rest of his manuscript and was lost (an alternative theory is that St. Mark died before finishing his Gospel).  From the incomplete manuscript the copies that end abruptly at verse 8 were directly or remotely copied.  At some point, two other people, dissatisfied with the abrupt ending at verse 8, and writing independently of each other, supplied the Longer and the Shorter endings.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Henry Barclay Swete, ''The Gospel according to St. Mark'' (1913, London, Macmillan &amp; Co.) page cvi; also James Moffatt, ''An Introduction to the Literature of the New Testament'' (1911, NY, Charles Scribner's Sons) page 238-239.&lt;/ref&gt; The longer ending was written perhaps as early as the last decade of the First Century and acquired some popularity, and the shorter ending could have been written even as late as a few centuries later.  The "lost page" theory has gotten wide acceptance,&lt;ref&gt;[[Brooke Foss Westcott]] &amp; [[Fenton John Anthony Hort]], ''The New Testament in the Original Greek'' (1881, London, Macmillan) vol. 2, Appendix pages 49-50; Robert Oliver Kevin, ''The Lost Ending of the Gospel According to Mark: A criticism and a reconstruction'', Journal of Biblical Literature, vol. 45, nr. 1/2 (1926) pages 85.&lt;/ref&gt; other theories have suggested that the last page was not lost by accident but was deliberately suppressed, perhaps because something in St. Mark's original conclusion was troublesome to certain Christians.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Oliver Kevin, ''The Lost Ending of the Gospel According to Mark: A criticism and a reconstruction'', Journal of Biblical Literature, vol. 45, nr. 1/2 (1926) pages 85-90.&lt;/ref&gt; No matter how or why the original and genuine conclusion to the Gospel disappeared, the fact remains that neither the Longer nor Shorter endings provides an authentic ending to verse 8.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Explanations aside, it is now widely (although not unanimously) accepted that St. Mark's own words end with verse 8 and anything after that was written by someone else at a later date.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bruce M. Metzger]], ''A Textual Commentary on the Greek New Testament A Companion Volume to the UBS Greek New Testament'' (1971, United Bible Societies) loc.cit, page 126; [[James Moffatt]], ''An Introduction to the Literature of the New Testament'' (1911, NY, Charles Scribner's Sons) page 240; Travis B. Williams, ''Bringing Method to the Madness: Examining the Style of the Longer Ending of Mark'', Bulletin for Biblical Research, vol. 20, nr. 3 (2010) pages 417 ("There has been little doubt that verses 9-20 came from the hand of someone other than the evangelist.").&lt;/ref&gt;

=== John 7:53-8:11 ===
{{main|Pericope adulterae}}

'''KJV:''' &lt;sub&gt;7:53&lt;/sub&gt;'' And every man went unto his own house.

&lt;sub&gt;8:1&lt;/sub&gt;'' Jesus went unto the Mount of Olives;

&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' And early in the morning he came again unto the Temple, and all the people came unto him, and he sat down, and taught them.

&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;'' And the Scribes and Pharisees brought unto him a woman taken in adultery, and when they had set her in the midst,

&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;'' They say unto him, "Master, this woman was taken in adultery, in the very act.

&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;'' Now Moses in the Law commanded us that such should be stoned, but what sayest thou?"

&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;'' This they said, tempting'' [testing] ''him, that they might have to'' [be able to] ''accuse him. But Jesus stooped down, and with his finger wrote on the ground &lt;ref&gt;The phrase "wrote on the ground" does not require that Jesus wrote ''words'' or letters, but it could also mean drawing pictures or doodling. cf. Hugh J. Schonfield, ''The Authentic'' [or ''Original''] ''New Testament'' (1955, London; rev. 1985, San Francisco, Harper &amp; Row) loc.cit. ("drew" and "scrawled"); Jennifer Knust &amp; Tommy Wasserman, ''Earth Accuses Earth: Tracing What Jesus Wrote on the Ground'', Harvard Theological Review, vol. 103, nr. 4 (Oct. 2010) page 411; Emil G. Kraeling, ''The Clarified New Testament'' (1962, NY, McGraw-Hill) vol. 1 page 297; Thomas Deans, ''The Rhetoric of Jesus Writing in the Story of the Woman Accused of Adultery'', College Composition and Communication, vol. 65 nr. 3 (Feb. 2014) page 414.&lt;/ref&gt; as though he heard them not.

&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;'' So when they continued asking him, he lift up himself, and said unto them, "He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her."

&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;'' And again, he stooped down, and wrote on the ground.''&lt;ref&gt;Several manuscripts -- namely U, Π, 73, 331, 364, 700, 782, 1592 and some Armenian mss -- end this sentence "the sins of each of them." This phrase is set out in a footnote in the NRSV (1989) - and was dramatized in Cecil B. DeMille's 1927 silent movie ''King of Kings'', but not mentioned in virtually all other modern translations.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;'' And they which heard it, being convicted by their own conscience, went out one by one, beginning at the eldest, even unto the last, and Jesus was left alone, and'' [with] ''the woman standing in the midst.

&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;'' When Jesus had lift up himself, and saw none but the woman, he said unto her, "Woman, where are thine accusers? Hath no man condemned thee?"

&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;'' She said, "No man, Lord." And Jesus said unto her, "Neither do I condemn thee. Go, and sin no more."

'''Reason:''' This familiar story of the adulteress saved by Jesus is a special case. These dozen verses have been the subject of a number of books, including Chris Keith, ''The Pericope Adulterae, the Gospel of John, and the Literacy of Jesus'' (2009, Leiden &amp; Boston, E.J. Brill); David Alan Black &amp; Jacob N. Cerone, eds., ''The Pericope of the Adulteress in Contemporary Research'' (2016, London &amp; NY, Bloomsbury T&amp;T Clark); and John David Punch, ''The Pericope Adulterae: Theories of Insertion &amp; Omission'' (2012, Saarbruken, Lap Lambert Academic Publ'g.).  The principal problem affecting this paragraph is that, although it appears in many ancient manuscripts, it does not consistently appear in this place in chapter 8 nor even in the Gospel of John. Moreover, in the various manuscripts in which the passage appears, it presents a much greater number of variations&lt;ref&gt;As an example of such a variation, in the KJV verse 9 occurs the phrase, "being convicted by their own conscience," - but this phrase did not appear in Erasmus's editions although it appeared in the Complutensian and most subsequent TR editions, nor in most manuscripts that contain this pericope.  It appears in K (Codex Cyprius) of the 9th century, and codex 579, of the 13th century, and a very few other places. It was not included in the earliest English versions - it is missing from Wycliffe, Tyndale, the Great Bible, the Geneva, the Rheims, and the Bishops Bible, and it apparently first appeared in the KJV.&lt;/ref&gt; than an equal portion of the New Testament - so much so, that it would seem that there are three distinct versions of the pericope.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Alford, ''The New Testament for English Readers'' (1871, Boston &amp; New York) vol. 1. page 535; Brooke Foss Westcott &amp; Fenton John Anthony Hort, ''The New Testament in the Original Greek'' (1881, Cambridge &amp; London, Macmillan &amp; Co.) vol. 2 (Appendix) page 88; Maurice A. Robinson &amp; William G. Pierpont, ''The New Testament in the Original Greek according to the Byzantine/Majority Textform'' (1991, Atlanta, The Original Word Publishers) pages 494-505.&lt;/ref&gt;

By its own context, this paragraph appears misplaced; in the verse preceding this pericope (namely verse 7:52) Jesus is conversing or arguing with a group of men, and in the verse following this pericope (verse 8:12) he is speaking "again unto them", even though verses 8:9-10 would indicate he was alone in the Temple courtyard.  It would seem possible that, originally, 7:52 was immediately followed by 8:12, and somehow this pericope was inserted between them, interrupting the narrative.&lt;ref&gt;[[Philip Schaff]], ''A Companion to the Greek Testament and the English Version'' (1883, NY, Harper &amp; Bros.) page 188; Christ Keith, ''Recent and Previous Research on the Pericope Adulterae'', Currents in Biblical Research, vol. 6, nr. 3 (June 2008), page 381.&lt;/ref&gt;

The pericope does not appear in the oldest Codexes - א, A,B,C,L,N,T,W,X,Δ,θ,Ψ - nor in papyri '''p'''&lt;sup&gt;66&lt;/sup&gt; or '''p'''&lt;sup&gt;75&lt;/sup&gt;, nor in minuscules 33, 157, 565, 892, 1241, or ƒ&lt;sup&gt;1424&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;In the case of Codex A and C, the manuscripts are damaged so that the actual text of John 7:53-8:11 is missing but the surrounding text does not leave enough space for the pericope to have been present. In the case of the papyri, these are so very fragmentary that they show only that the pericope was not in its familiar place at the beginning of chapter 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Scrivener lists more than 50 minuscules that lack the pericope, and several more in which the original scribe omitted it but a later hand inserted it. It is also missing from the Syriac and Sahidic versions and some Egyptian versions.  The earliest Greek Codex showing this pericope at all is D (Codex Bezae), of the 5th or 6th century, and some Old Latin manuscripts no older than the 5th century, and many subsequent Greek and Latin mss all at the familiar location following John 7:52.  The first Greek Church Father to mention the pericope in its familiar place was Euthymius, of the 12th century.

However, one minuscule (ms. 225) placed the pericope after John 7:36.  Several -- ƒ&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; -- placed it at the very end of the Gospel of John, and Scrivener adds several more that have so placed a shorter pericope beginning at verse 8:3.  Another handful of minuscules -- ƒ&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt; -- put it after Luke 21:38. Some manuscripts -- S,E,Λ -- had it in the familiar place but enclosed the pericope with marks of doubt (asterisks or some other glyph), and Scrivener lists more than 40 minuscules that also apply marks of doubt to the pericope.&lt;ref&gt;UBS, loc. cit.; [[Bruce M. Metzger]], ''A Textual Commentary on the Greek New Testament A Companion Volume to the UBS Greek New Testament'' (1971, United Bible Societies) loc.cit.; Chris Keith, ''The Initial Location of the Pericope Adulterae in Fourfold Tradition'', Novum Testamentum, vol. 51 (2009), page 209-231; [[Frederick Henry [Ambrose] Scrivener]], ''A Plain Introduction to the Criticism of the New Testament'' (3d ed. 1883, London) pages 610-614.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars have suggested that the pericope is not written in the same style as the rest of the Fourth Gospel, and have suggested it is written more in the style of the Gospel of Luke, a suggestion supported by the fact that the ƒ&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt; manuscripts actually put the pericope into the Gospel of Luke.&lt;ref&gt;Henry J. Cadbury, ''A Possible Case of Lukan Authorship'', Harvard Theological Review, vol. 10, nr. 3 (July 1917) pages 237-244; Kyle R. Hughes, ''The Lukan Special Material and the Tradition History of the Pericope Adulterae'', Novum Testamentum, vol. 55 (2013) page 232-251.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, nowhere else does the Fourth Gospel mention by name the Mount of Olives, and where a new place is mentioned in the Fourth Gospel some explanatory remarks are attached, nor does the Fourth Gospel mention 'the Scribes' elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Alford, ''The New Testament for English Readers'' (1871, Boston &amp; New York) vol. 1. pages 535-536.&lt;/ref&gt; A theory shared by several scholars is that this pericope represents some very early tradition or folktale about Jesus, not originally found in any of the canonical Gospels, which was so popular or compelling that it was deliberately inserted into a Gospel;&lt;ref&gt;Brooke Foss Westcott &amp; Fenton John Anthony Hort, ''The New Testament in the Original Greek'' (1881, Cambridge &amp; London, Macmillan &amp; Co.) vol. 2 (Appendix) page 87.&lt;/ref&gt; a variant on this theory is that this anecdote was written down as a note for a sermon, perhaps in the margin of a codex or on a scrap inserted between the pages of a codex, and a subsequent copyist mistakenly incorporated it in the main text when working up a new copy.  Its source might be indicated by [[Eusebius]] (early 4th century), in his ''Historia Ecclesia'', book 3, sec. 39, where he says, "[[Papias of Hierapolis|Papias]] [2nd century] ... reproduces a story about a woman falsely accused before the Lord of many sins. This is to be found in the ''Gospel of the Hebrews''."&lt;ref&gt;Eusebius, ''The History of the Church'' (transl. G.A. Williamson)(1965, Baltimore, Penguin Books) page 153.  The Gospel of the Hebrew is lost and so is Papias's repetition of this story.&lt;/ref&gt;

The evidence that the pericope, although a much-beloved story, does not belong in the place assigned it by many late manuscripts, and, further, that it might not be part of the original text of any of the Gospels, caused the Revised Version (1881) to enclose it within brackets, in its familiar place after John 7:52, with the sidenote, "Most of the ancient authorities omit John 7:51-8:11. Those which contain it vary much from each other." This practice has been imitated in most of the English versions since then.  The Westcott &amp; Hort Greek New Testament omitted the pericope from the main text and places it as an appendix after the end of the Fourth Gospel, with this explanation:&lt;ref&gt;Brooke Foss Westcott &amp; Fenton John Anthony Hort, ''The New Testament in the Original Greek'' (1881, Cambridge &amp; London, Macmillan &amp; Co.) vol. 2 (Introduction) page 300.&lt;/ref&gt; "It has no right to a place in the text of the Four Gospels; yet it is evidently from an ancient source, and it could not now without serious loss be entirely banished from the New Testament. .... As it forms an independent narrative, it seems to stand best alone at the end of the Gospels with double brackets to show its inferior authority ....." Some English translations based on Westcott &amp; Hort imitate this practice of appending the pericope at the end of the Gospel (e.g., The Twentieth Century New Testament), while others simply omit it altogether (e.g., Goodspeed, Ferrar Fenton, The New World Version).  The Nestle-Aland and UBS Greek editions enclose it in double brackets.  The two 'Majority Text' Greek editions set forth the pericope in the main text (varying slightly from each other) but provide extensive notes elsewhere&lt;ref&gt;(1) Zane C. Hodges &amp; Arthur L. Farstad, ''The Greek New Testament According to the Majority Text'' (2nd ed. 1985, Nashville, Thomas Nelson) pages xxiii-xxxii; (2) Maurice A. Robinson &amp; William G. Pierpont, ''The New Testament in the Original Greek according to the Byzantine/Majority Textform'' (1991, Atlanta, The Original Word Publishers) pages 494-505.&lt;/ref&gt; attesting to the lack of uniformity in the text of the pericope and doubts about its origin.

== Other English translations ==

O = omitted in main text.

B = bracketed in the main text&amp;nbsp;– The translation team and most biblical scholars today believe were not part of the original text. However, these texts have been retained in brackets in the NASB and the Holman CSB.&lt;ref&gt;See Introduction to the Holman Christian Standard Bible 2005&amp;nbsp;– Removed from 2009 edition&amp;nbsp;– They were retained because of their 'undeniable antiquity and their value for tradition and the history of NT interpretation in the church.'&lt;/ref&gt;

F = omission noted in the footnote.

== Versification differences ==

Some English translations have minor versification differences compared with the KJV.

=== Romans 14 and 16 ===

The KJV ends the Epistle to the Romans with these verses as 16:25-27:

'''KJV:''' &lt;sub&gt;25&lt;/sub&gt; ''Now to him that is of power to establish you according to my Gospel, and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery, which was kept secret since the world began:''

&lt;sub&gt;26&lt;/sub&gt; ''But now is made manifest, and by the Scriptures of the Prophets, according to the commandment of the everlasting God, made known to all nations for the obedience of faith,''

&lt;sub&gt;27&lt;/sub&gt; ''To God, only wise, be glory through Jesus Christ, for ever. Amen.''

[Note: Different editions of the KJV show various treatments of the punctuation, especially at the end of the verses, and of capitalization, especially at the beginning of the verses. The quotation above uses the punctuation and capitalization of the original 1611 edition of the KJV.]

The KJV has 23 verses in chapter 14 and 33 verses in chapter 15 of Romans.

Most translations follow KJV (based on Textus Receptus) versification and have Romans 16:25-27 and Romans 14:24-26 do not exist.

The WEB bible, however, moves Romans 16:25-27 (end of chapter verses) to Romans 14:24-26 (also end of chapter verses).

WEB explains with a footnote in Romans 16:

Textus Receptus places Romans 14:24-26 at the end of Romans instead of at the end of chapter 14, and numbers these verses 16:25-27

=== 2 Corinthians 13:14 ===

The KJV has:

: 12 ''Greet one another with an holy kiss.''
: 13 ''All the saints salute you.''
: 14 ''The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God,''&lt;br&gt;
:  ''and the communion of the Holy Ghost, ''[be]'' with you all. Amen.''

In some translations, verse 13 is combined with verse 12, leaving verse 14 renumbered as verse 13.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://studybible.info/compare/2Corinthians+13:12|title=2 Corinthians 13:12 Greet one another with a holy kiss!|website=studybible.info|accessdate=14 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 3 John 15 ===

3 John 14-15 ESV are merged as a single verse in the KJV. Thus verse 15 does not exist in the KJV.

The KJV is quoted as having 31,102 verses. This is an exact figure.

The ESV, however, is quoted as having 31,103. This is '''solely''' because of this difference. The figure 31,103 is achieved by adding up the last verse for each and every chapter which is why it is impacted by end of chapter differences. The figure 31,103 does not account for the "missing verses" referred to above which are missing mid-chapter. Thus the actual number of verses in the ESV is less than 31,103.

Note that in relation to 2 Corinthians 13:14, another end of chapter anomaly (as opposed to mid-chapter), the ESV and KJV agree.

=== Revelation 12:18 ===
In the KJV, this is treated as the first half of 13:1: &lt;br&gt; '''KJV:'''  ''And I stood upon the sand of the sea, '' and saw a beast rise up ..... &lt;br&gt;
Some versions, including pre-KJV versions such as the Tyndale Bible, the Geneva Bible, and the Bishops Bible, treat the italicized words as a complete verse and numbered as 12:18, with similar words.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In several modern versions, this is treated as a continuation of 12:17 or as a complete verse numbered 12:18: &lt;br&gt;  
'''RV:'''  ''And he stood upon the sand of the sea.''   &lt;br&gt;
(Some say "it stood" - the ''he'' or ''it'' being the Dragon mentioned in the preceding verses)  Among pre-KJV versions, the Great Bible and the Rheims version also have "he stood".
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
'''Reasons:'''  The earliest resources - including '''p'''&lt;sup&gt;47&lt;/sup&gt;, א, A,C, several minuscules, several Italic mss, the Vulgate, the Armenian and Ethiopic versions, and quotation in some early Church Fathers - support "he stood" (or "it stood").  The  KJV and TR follow codex P (9th century) and a smattering of other (mostly late) resources in reading "I stood".  Metzger suggests that the TR text is the result of copyists' assimilation to the verb form in 13:1 ("I saw a beast").&lt;ref&gt;.[[Bruce M. Metzger]], ''A Textual Commentary on the Greek New Testament A Companion Volume to the UBS Greek New Testament'' (1971, United Bible Societies) loc.cit.; the UBS Greek New Testament, loc.cit.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Psalms ===

This segment deals with part of the Old Testament.  The verse numbers used in Hebrew (Jewish) editions of the Old Testament are usually the same numbers as used in the KJV, inasmuch as both used the chapter and verse numbers employed in early printed editions of the Latin Vulgate, but there are exceptions.&lt;ref&gt;G.F. Moore, ''The Vulgate Chapters and Numbered Verses in the Hebrew Bible'', Journal of Biblical Literature, vol. 12 (1893) pages 73-78; Ludwig Blau, ''Massoretic Studies ... The Division into Verses'', Jewish Quarterly Review, vol. 8, nr.2 (Jan. 1896) pages 356-359, and continued, vol. 9, nr.1 (Oct. 1896) pages 122-125; Jordan S. Penkower, ''Verse Divisions in the Hebrew Bible'', Vetus Testamentum, vol. 50, nr.3 (2000) pages 379-393; C. David Ginsburg, ''Introduction to the Massoretico-Critical Edition of the Hebrew Bible'' (1897, London, Trinitarian Bible Soc.) chapter VI (The Division into Verses), pages 68-108.&lt;/ref&gt; A table of the places in the Old Testament where the KJV verse numbering differs from that used in printed Hebrew editions is presented, for example, in Strong's ''Exhaustive Concordance to the Bible'' in the appendix on the page following his Hebrew dictionary.&lt;ref&gt;From Strong's Exhaustive Concordance, https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.31175007170429;view=1up;seq=1735 .&lt;/ref&gt; Another such table appears in the appendix to The Jewish Study Bible.&lt;ref&gt;Adele Berlin &amp; Marc Zvi Brettler, eds., ''The Jewish Study Bible'' (2004, NY, Oxford Univ. Press) pages 2118-2119.&lt;/ref&gt;

The part of the Old Testament where the differences in verse numbering is most conspicuous and frequent is the Book of Psalms (in Hebrew, ''Tehillim''), because the title lines of each Psalm are not assigned a number in the Hebrew editions, whereas in the KJV they are always numbered as 1, and the first lyric verse of the Psalm is numbered as 2.
The vast majority of English translations adhere to English KJV verse numbering. However, a few translations vary somewhat.

This list is based on Psalm 51.

* Douay-Rheims
* NABRE (adheres to Jewish verse numbering)
* Orthodox Jewish Bible (adheres to English verse numbering but notes Jewish verse numbering also)
* The Passion Translation (merges verse numbering)
* Tree of Life Version (adheres to Jewish verse numbering)

=== Second Esdras ===

This segment deals with a part of the Old Testament Apocrypha, which appeared in the original edition of the KJV (and still appears in some 'complete' editions).  In the KJV text of chapter 7 of the [[2 Esdras|Second Book of Esdras]] (this book is also known, in the Latin Vulgate, as ''Fourth'' Esdras, or Fourth Ezra, because the Vulgate named the canonical books of Ezra and Nehemiah as First and Second Esdras) the following passage occurs:

'''KJV''': &lt;sub&gt;7:35&lt;/sub&gt; [An angel is speaking to Ezra:] ''"And the work shall follow, and the reward shall be shown,''

''and the good deeds shall be of force, and wicked deeds shall bear no rule."'' &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; ¶ &lt;sub&gt;7:36&lt;/sub&gt; ''Then said I, "Abraham''

''prayed first for the Sodomites, and Moses for the fathers that sinned in the wilderness....."''

This was translated from the available printed editions of the Latin Vulgate, and this is how the text stood in every printed edition of the Vulgate of that time and for nearly three centuries afterward.  However, the Second Book of Esdras existed also in non-Latin versions - Arabic, Syriac, Ethiopic, Armenian - and those versions exhibited a lengthy additional text of the between the two verses above, in the spot indicated by the pilcrow (¶).  This additional text had been noticed, possibly for the first time, in a 14th century Arabic version in the mid-17th century by Oxford scholar [[John Gregory (scholar)|John Gregory]], and it appeared in print in German books published in the second quarter of the 18th century and it thereafter was translated into English.  But this lengthy passage seemed not to appear in any Latin manuscript.  And then, around 1826, Professor John Palmer (1769-1840), professor of Arabic at St. John's College, Cambridge, found a 9th or 10th century Latin manuscript in Alcala, Spain - the Codex Complutensis - which contained the passage.  He copied the Latin text but did not make it public and it was kept among his papers at Cambridge after his death.  Some 37 years later it was found among his papers and published in the Journal of Philology.  However, by that time, Professor [[Robert L. Bensly]] of Cambridge had independently found that same passage in another Latin manuscript of the 9th century - the manuscript was Codex Ambianensis, at Amiens, France.  In 1865, Professor [[Johann Gildemeister]], of the University of Bonn, discovered that in the oldest Latin manuscript of Second Esdras, the [[Codex Sangermanensis I]], written in 822, formerly kept at the Benedictine Abbey of St. Germain des Prés in Paris and by then kept in the Bibliothèque Nationale, the page between the two verses quoted above - the page on which the missing passage would have appeared - had been cut out and the evidence showed that the page had been deliberately cut out in early times and that virtually all the existing Latin manuscripts of Second Esdras had been copied or derived from that codex after that mutilation.  Even now only a handful of Latin manuscripts have been found that contain the "Missing Fragment". Robert Bensly published a full history of the detective work that discovered the missing passage and the reason it was missing in a book published in 1875.&lt;ref&gt;Robert L. Bensly, ''The Missing Fragment of the Latin Translation of the Fourth Book of Ezra'' (1875, Cambridge) 95 pages.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bensly was subsequently appointed to the Apocrypha Committee of the Revised Version of the English Bible (he was a published authority on Sirach and Maccabees as well as Second Esdras).  He died in 1893, the year before the Revised Version of the Apocrypha was published, but the text set forth the "Missing Fragment" immediately after verse 35, with its own verses numbered inside square brackets, beginning with verse [36] until the end of the Missing Fragment at verse [105], where the previously known text resumes with verse 36 (modern versions differ on how they number the remaining verses in chapter 7). The Revised version presents the verses before and after the Missing Fragment this way:

'''RV:''' &lt;sub&gt;7:35&lt;/sub&gt; ''"And the word shall follow, and the reward shall be shewed,''

''and good deeds shall awake, and wicked deeds shall not sleep.'' &amp;nbsp; ¶ &amp;nbsp; &lt;sub&gt;7:[36]&lt;/sub&gt; ''And the''

''pit of torment shall appear, and over against it shall be the place of rest; and the furnace''

''of hell shall be shewed, and over against it the paradise of delight. .....''

The Missing Fragment adds seventy verses to the text previously known to English-language readers.  The Revised Version contained a side-note: "The passage from verse [36] to verse [105], formerly missing, has been restored to the text."
The seventy added verses prophecy a horrifying image of Judgment Day, in which the vast majority of mankind will be damned, and no one will be left to pray for mercy for them.  The text that was available in the KJV resumes after verse [105]:

'''RV:''' &lt;sub&gt;7:[105]&lt;/sub&gt; ''... so never shall anyone pray for another in that day, neither''

''shall one lay a burden on another, for then shall all bear every one his own righteousness''

''or unrighteousness."'' &amp;nbsp; ¶ &amp;nbsp; &lt;sub&gt;7:36&lt;/sub&gt; ''And I answered and said, "How do we now find''

''that first Abraham prayed for the people of Sodom, and Moses for the fathers that sinned ....."''

This disturbing image may be the reason that the page was cut out from the Codex Sangermanensis.&lt;ref&gt;Robert L.

'''''Love and Its Place in Nature: A Philosophical Interpretation of Freudian Psychoanalysis''''' (1990; second edition 1998) is a book about [[psychoanalysis]] by the philosopher [[Jonathan Lear]], in which the author discusses the importance of love in Freudian theory.

The book received positive reviews, praising it as an accessible discussion of psychoanalysis.

==Summary==
Lear argues that [[Sigmund Freud]]'s creation of psychoanalysis involves "three related elements whose significance we have only begun to understand: a science of subjectivity; the discovery of an archaic form of mental functioning; the positing of Love as a basic force in nature." He also argues that most criticisms and defenses of psychoanalysis are irrelevant.{{sfn|Lear|1992|pages=3, 5}}

==Publication history==
''Love and Its Place in Nature'' was first published in 1990 by [[Farrar, Straus and Giroux]] in the United States and [[HarperCollins]] in Canada. In 1992, the book was published by [[Faber and Faber]] in the United Kingdom.{{sfn|Lear|1992|page=iv}} In 1998, it was published in a second edition with a new preface by Lear.{{sfn|Millgram|2001|page=1087–1092}}

==Reception==
===Mainstream media===
''Love and Its Place in Nature'' received positive reviews from Genevieve Stuttaford in ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'',{{sfn|Stuttaford|1990|page=59}} Paul Hymowitz in ''[[Library Journal]]'',{{sfn|Hymowitz|1990|page=1087}} and Don Browning in ''[[The Christian Century]]'',{{sfn|Browning|1991|page=340}} and a negative review from Robert Brown in ''[[The Times Literary Supplement]]''.{{sfn|Brown|1991|pages=22}} The book was also reviewed by Michael Kott in ''[[The New Leader]]'',{{sfn|Kott|1991|pages=19–20}} and listed in ''[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]]''.{{sfn|''The Chronicle of Higher Education''|1990|page=A13}}

Stuttaford described the book as a "heartfelt and scholarly treatise" that provided an "impassioned, generous interpretation" of psychoanalysis and further develops "the revolutionary models raised in Freud's writings." She compared it to the psychoanalyst [[Reuben Fine]]'s ''Love and Work: The Value System of Psychoanalysis'' (1990), but found it "more tightly focused".{{sfn|Stuttaford|1990|page=59}} Hymowitz described Lear's book as "simply written and accessible". He credited Lear with being conversant with psychoanalytic theory, explaining psychoanalytic concepts in a "lucid and compelling manner", and convincingly arguing that they have a psychological rather than a biological root, and that "love rather than sex and aggression" is a central motivator in Freudian theory. He wrote that psychological theorists might question Hymowitz's neglect of the psychoanalyst [[Erich Fromm]], and other authors who have focused on love without being committed to Freudian orthodoxy, but concluded that both lay readers and scholars would benefit from Lear's discussion of psychoanalysis.{{sfn|Hymowitz|1990|page=1087}}

Browning credited Lear with providing an "engaging philosophical perspective on Freudian psychoanalysis", "an important philosophic reading of Freud", and profoundly investigating important themes. He predicted that the themes of ''Love and Its Place in Nature'' would appeal to religious readers, despite the fact that the book itself was not religious, and compared it to the philosopher [[Paul Ricœur]]'s ''[[Freud and Philosophy]]'' (1965), though he commented that it was more accessible to the average reader.{{sfn|Browning|1991|page=340}}

Brown wrote that Lear sometimes seems to favor the view that psychoanalytic claims "are in practice untestable but nevertheless true" adding that, "If that is his claim, it will be enthusiastically received by seers, gurus, and oracles everywhere."{{sfn|Brown|1991|pages=22}}

===Scientific and academic journals===
''Love and Its Place in Nature'' received a positive review from the philosopher [[Elijah Millgram]] in ''[[Mind (journal)|Mind]]'' and a negative review from Carl Goldberg in the ''[[American Journal of Psychotherapy]]''.{{sfn|Millgram|2001|page=1087–1092}}{{sfn|Goldberg|1999|pages=564–565}}

Millgram wrote that the book had "received less attention from the philosophical community than its deserves" due to negative views of Freud held by analytic philosophers. He praised Lear's discussion of Freud for its lack of orthodoxy, writing that "Freud provides Lear with a way of raising and thinking through a range of important but generally neglected issues" and that Lear's work remained valuable and "of great philosophical interest" even if one rejected many Freudian views. He endorsed Lear's view that "propositional attitudes" and "applying concepts" are "psychological achievements" and that "to have a mind is always to be generating new proto-mental material". However, he considered it open to question how far Lear's "description of the way a mind emerges from the field of archaic thought, and of what is going on in psychoanalysis" should be accepted.{{sfn|Millgram|2001|page=1087–1092}}

Goldberg described the book as "provocative". He wrote that Lear argues that Freud's therapeutic methods are "efforts to enable the patient to change the type of responsibility for he characterologically assumes for his emotions", a view Goldberg criticized because of Lear's failure "to notice the unfortunate counterpoint to psychoanalysis' concern with individuation—social irrelevance and a lack of attention to moral responsibility." He argued that Lear's view that "analytic inquiry" is an "act of generosity and compassion" misrepresents Freud, and avoids what Freud actually wrote about love. He also disputed Lear's view that "Freud was committed to science", writing that it was more likely that Freud was "quite ambivalent" about the subject, and found Lear's attempt to reconcile Freud's determinism with personal responsibility unconvincing. He concluded that the book provided a "thoughtful account of what Lear believes psychoanalysis should be about", but that readers should not assume that Lear's views follow logically from Freud's.{{sfn|Goldberg|1999|pages=564–565}}

===Evaluations in books===
The historian Paul Robinson suggested in ''Freud and His Critics'' (1993) that ''Love and Its Place in Nature'' represented a revival of Freud's reputation. He compared the book in this respect to Mark Edmundson's ''Towards Reading Freud'' (1990).{{sfn|Robinson|1993|page=270}}

'''Melchiorre Gioja '''(10 September 1767 – 2 January 1829) was an  [[Italy|Italian]] writer on [[philosophy]] and [[political economy]]. His name is spelled '''Gioia''' in modern Italian.

==Biography==
Gioja was born at [[Piacenza]], in what is now northern [[Italy]].

Originally intended for the church, he took orders, but renounced them in 1796 and went to [[Milan]], where he devoted himself to the study of political economy. Having obtained the prize for an essay on "the kind of free government best adapted to Italy" he decided upon the career of a [[publicist]].

The arrival of [[Napoleon]] in Italy drew him into public life. He advocated a republic under the dominion of the French in a pamphlet ''I Tedeschi, i Francesi, ed i Russi in Lombardia'', and under the [[Cisalpine Republic]] he was named historiographer and director of statistics. He was imprisoned several times, once for eight months in 1820 on a charge of being implicated in a conspiracy with the [[Carbonari]]. After the fall of Napoleon he retired into private life, and does not appear to have held office again.

Gioja's fundamental idea is the value of statistics or the collection of facts. Philosophy itself is with him classification and consideration of ideas. Logic he regarded as a practical art, and his ''Esercizio logico ''has the further title,  ''Art of deriving benefit from ill-constructed books''. In [[ethics]] Gioja follows [[Jeremy Bentham|Bentham]] generally, and his large treatise ''Del merito e delle recompense'' (1818) is a clear and systematic view of social ethics from the [[utilitarianism|utilitarian principle]].

In political economy this avidity for facts produced better fruits. The ''Nuovo Prospetto delle scienze economiche'' (1815-1817), although long to excess, and overburdened with classifications and tables, contains much valuable material. The author prefers large properties and large commercial undertakings to small ones, and strongly favours association as a means of production. He defends a restrictive policy and insists on the necessity of the action of the state as a regulating power in the industrial world. He was an opponent of ecclesiastical domination. He must be credited with the finest and most original treatment of division of labour since the ''[[Wealth of Nations]]''.

Much of what [[Charles Babbage|Babbage]] taught later on the subject of combined work is anticipated by Gioja. His theory of production is also deserving of attention from the fact that it takes into account and gives due prominence to immaterial goods. Throughout the work there is continuous opposition to [[Adam Smith]]. Gioja's latest work ''Filosofia della statistica'' (2 vols, 1826; 4 vols, 1829-1830) contains in brief compass the essence of his ideas on human life, and affords the clearest insight into his aim and method in philosophy both theoretical and practical.

He was one of the founders of the ''Annali universali di statistica''.

Historically, the '''[[merger]] doctrine''' (a.k.a. "doctrine of merger") was the notion that marriage caused a woman's [[legal]] identity to merge with that of her husband.  

Thus, a woman could not [[lawsuit|sue]] or [[testify]] against her husband any more than he could sue or testify against himself. Since her identity had merged with his, the two were now considered one legal entity.

Kapleau was born in [[New Haven, Connecticut]]. As a teenager he worked as a bookkeeper. He briefly studied law and later became an accomplished court reporter. In 1945 he served as chief Allied court reporter for the "Trial of the Major War Criminals Before the International Military Tribunal", which judged the leaders of [[Nazi Germany]]. This was the first of the series commonly known as the [[Nuremberg Trials]].

Kapleau later covered the [[International Military Tribunal for the Far East]], commonly known as the Tokyo War Crimes Trials. While in Japan he became intrigued by and drawn to Zen Buddhism. During the tribunal he became acquainted with [[Karlfried Graf Dürckheim]], then a prisoner at [[Sugamo Prison]], who recommended that Kapleau attend informal lectures given by [[D.T. Suzuki]] in [[Kita-Kamakura]].&lt;ref&gt;Albert Stunkard, "Philip Kapleau’s First Encounter with Zen", (Chapter 1) in ''Zen Teaching, Zen Practice: Philip Kapleau And The Three Pillars Of Zen,'' Weatherhill 2000, edited by Kenneth Kraft; {{ISBN|978-0834804401}}.&lt;/ref&gt; After returning to America, Kapleau renewed his acquaintance with D.T. Suzuki who had left Kita-Kamakura to lecture on Zen at [[Columbia University]]. But disaffected with a primarily intellectual treatment of Zen, he moved to Japan in 1953 to seek Zen's deeper truth.

==Zen training==
He trained initially with [[Soen Nakagawa]], then rigorously with [[Daiun Harada]] at the temple Hosshin-ji. Later he became a disciple of [[Hakuun Yasutani]], himself a dharma heir of Harada.&lt;ref&gt;Yasutani p. XXVI&lt;/ref&gt; After 13 years' training, Kapleau was ordained by Yasutani in 1965 and given permission to teach. Kapleau ended his relationship with Yasutani formally in 1967 over disagreements about teaching and other personal issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sharf |first1=Robert, H. |title=Sanbokyodan.

According to Andrew Rawlinson, "Kapleau has created his own Zen lineage."&lt;ref&gt;Ford p. 156&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work and teaching==
During a book tour in 1965 he was invited to teach meditation at a gathering in [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]], New York{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}. In 1966 he left Japan to create the [[Rochester Zen Center]].&lt;ref name="Ford p. 154"/&gt;

For almost 40 years, Kapleau taught at the Center and in many other settings around the world, and provided his own [[dharma transmission]] to several disciples of both genders. He also introduced many modifications to the Japanese Zen tradition, such as chanting the [[Heart Sutra]] in the vernacular English in the U.S., or Polish at the Center he founded in Katowice. He often emphasized that Zen Buddhism adapted so readily to new cultures especially because it was not dependent upon a dogmatic external form. At the same time he recognized that it was not always easy to discern the form from the essence, and one had to be careful not to "[[wikt:throw the baby out with the bathwater|throw the baby out with the bathwater]]."

He lived with [[Parkinson’s Disease]] for several years, and while his physical mobility was reduced, he enjoyed lively and trenchant interactions with a steady stream of visitors throughout his life. On May 6, 2004, he died peacefully in the backyard of the Rochester Zen Center, surrounded by many of his closest disciples and friends.

==Writings==
Kapleau transcribed other Zen teachers' talks, interviewed lay students and monks, and recorded the practical details of Zen Buddhist practice. His book, ''The Three Pillars of Zen'', was published in 1965, has been translated into 12 languages, and is still in print.&lt;ref&gt;Yasutani p. XXV&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Zen Teaching, Zen Practice: Philip Kapleau and The Three Pillars of Zen|url=http://www.thezensite.com/ZenBookReviews/ZenteachingZenpractice.htm|website=thezensite|accessdate=25 July 2014|quote=First published in 1965, it has not been out of print ever since, has been translated into ten languages and, perhaps most importantly, still inspires newcomers to take up the practice of Zen Buddhism.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was one of the first English-language books to present Zen Buddhism not as philosophy, but as a pragmatic and salutary way of training and living.

Kapleau was an articulate and passionate writer. His emphasis in writing and teaching was that insight and [[bodhi|enlightenment]] are available to anyone, not just austere and isolated Zen monks. Also well known for his views on [[vegetarianism]], peace and compassion, he remains widely read, and is a notable influence on Zen Buddhism as it is practiced in the West. Today, his dharma heirs, descendants and former students teach at Zen Centers around the world.

==Grist for the mill==
A favorite saying of Philip Kapleau was "Grist for the mill" which means that all of our troubles and trials can be useful or contain some profit to us. In the spirit of this his gravestone is one of the mill-stones from [[Chapin Mill]], the 135-acre (0.55 km2) Buddhist retreat center whose land was donated by a founding member of the Rochester Zen Center, Ralph Chapin.

[[File:Max stirner.jpg|thumb|Portrait of Stirner by philosophical rival [[Friedrich Engels]]]]
The '''philosophy of Max Stirner''' is credited as a major influence in the development of [[individualism]], [[nihilism]], [[existentialism]], [[post-modernism]] and [[anarchism]] (especially of [[egoist anarchism]], [[individualist anarchism]], [[postanarchism]] and [[post-left anarchy]]). [[Max Stirner]]'s main philosophical work was ''[[The Ego and Its Own]]'', also known as ''The Ego and His Own'' (''Der Einzige und sein Eigentum'' in German, or more accurately ''The Individual and his Property''). Stirner's philosophy has been cited as an influence on both his contemporaries, most notably [[Karl Marx]] (who was strongly opposed to Stirner's views)&lt;ref&gt;Marx reacted to Stirner with a voluminous polemics ''Saint Max'', that he never published; cf. [http://question-everything.mahost.org/Archive/MarxAndStirner.doc Nicholas Lobkowicz: ''Karl Marx and Max Stirner.''] In: Frederick J. Adelmann (ed.): ''Demythologizing Marxism: A Series Of Studies On Marxism''. Boston: Boston College Chestnut Hill 1969.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as subsequent thinkers such as [[Friedrich Nietzsche]],&lt;ref&gt;The possible influence on Nietzsche was a heavily disputed topic around 1900 and recently again. For a summary and a fresh view, see [http://www.lsr-projekt.de/poly/ennietzsche.html ''Bernd A. Laska: Nietzsche's Initial Crisis''] (2002); [[#See also|See also]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Enrico Arrigoni]], [[Steven T. Byington]], [[Benjamin R. Tucker]], [[Emile Armand]], [[Albert Camus]]&lt;ref name="camus"&gt;"[[Albert Camus]] devotes a section of ''[[The Rebel (book)|The Rebel]]'' to Stirner". [http://www.sccs.swarthmore.edu/users/00/pwillen1/lit/egomax.htm "The Egoism of Max Stirner"] by Sidney Parker.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Saul Newman]].

== Thought ==
=== The self ===
Stirner argues that the concept of the self is something impossible to fully comprehend; a so-called "creative nothing" he described as an "end-point of language": {{quotation|The Unique One is the straightforward, sincere, plain-phrase. It is the end point of our phrase world, of this world in whose "beginning was the Word."|Max Stirner|''Stirner's Critics''}}

In order to understand this creative nothing, Stirner uses poetry and vivid imagery. The creative nothing by its dialectical shortcomings creates the need for a description, for meaning: {{quotation|What Stirner says is a word, a thought, a concept; what he means is no word, no thought, no concept. What he says is not what is meant, and what he means is unsayable.|Max Stirner|''Stirner's Critics''}}

Stirner elaborated this attempt to describe the indescribable in the essay ''Stirner's Critics'', written by Stirner in response to Feuerbach and others (in custom with the time, he refers to himself in the third person): {{quotation|Stirner speaks of the Unique and says immediately: Names name you not. He articulates the word, so long as he calls it the Unique, but adds nonetheless that the Unique is only a name. He thus means something different from what he says, as perhaps someone who calls you Ludwig does not mean a Ludwig in general, but means You, for which he has no word. [...] It is the end point of our phrase world, of this world in whose "beginning was the Word."|Max Stirner|''Stirner's Critics''}}

''The Ego and Its Own'' opens and closes with a quotation from [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]] that reads "I have taken up my cause without foundation", with the unstated next line of the poem being "and all the world is mine". One of Stirner's central ideas is that in realizing the self is "nothing" one is said to "own the world" because—as the book states in its last line—"all things are nothing to me" [''Ibidem'', p.&amp;nbsp;324]: {{quotation|By bringing the essence into prominence one degrades the hitherto misapprehended appearance to a bare semblance, a deception. The essence of the world, so attractive and splendid, is for him who looks to the bottom of it—emptiness; emptiness is—world's essence (world's doings).|Max Stirner|''The Ego and Its Own'', p. 40}}
{{quotation|[F]or 'being' is abstraction, as is even 'the I'. Only I am not abstraction alone: I am all in all, consequently, even abstraction or nothing: I am all and nothing; I am not a mere thought, but at the same time I am full of thoughts, a thought-world.|Max Stirner|''The Ego and Its Own'', p. 300}}
{{quotation|I say: liberate yourself as far as you can, and you have done your part; for it is not given to every one to break through all limits, or, more expressively, not to everyone is that a limit which is a limit for the rest. Consequently, do not tire yourself with toiling at the limits of others; enough if you tear down yours. [...] He who overturns one of his limits may have shown others the way and the means; the overturning of their limits remains their affair.|Max Stirner|''The Ego and Its Own'', p. 127}}

Stirner describes this world view in brief as "enjoyment" and claims that the "nothingness" of the non-self is "unutterable" (p.&amp;nbsp;314) or "unnameable" (p.&amp;nbsp;132), "unspeakable" yet "a mere word" (p.&amp;nbsp;164; cf. Stirner's comments on the skeptic concepts ataraxia and aphasia, p.&amp;nbsp;26).

=== Egoism ===
Stirner has been broadly understood as a proponent of both [[psychological egoism]] and [[ethical egoism]], although the latter position can be disputed as there is no claim in Stirner's writing in which one ought to pursue one's own interest and further claiming any "ought" could be seen as a new "fixed idea". Therefore, he may be understood as a [[rational egoist]] in the sense that he considered it irrational not to act in one's self-interest. However, how this self-interest is defined is necessarily subjective, allowing both selfish and altruistic normative claims to be included. Further, rationality as an end in and of itself is another fixed idea.

Individual self-realization rests on each individual's desire to fulfill their [[Egoist anarchism|egoism]]. The difference between an unwilling and a willing egoist is that the former will be 'possessed' by an empty idea and believe that they are fulfilling a higher cause, but usually being unaware that they are only fulfilling their own desires to be happy or secure; and the latter, in contrast, will be a person that is able to freely choose its actions, fully aware that they are only fulfilling individual desires: {{quotation|Sacred things exist only for the egoist who does not acknowledge himself, the ''involuntary egoist'' [...] in short, for the egoist who would like not to be an egoist, and abases himself (combats his egoism), but at the same time abases himself only for the sake of "being exalted", and therefore of gratifying his egoism. Because he would like to cease to be an egoist, he looks about in heaven and earth for higher beings to serve and sacrifice himself to; but, however much he shakes and disciplines himself, in the end he does all for his own sake [...]. On this account I call him the involuntary egoist.

[...] As you are each instant, you are your own creature in this very 'creature' you do not wish to lose yourself, the creator. You are yourself a higher being than you are, and surpass yourself [...] just this, as an involuntary egoist, you fail to recognize; and therefore the 'higher essence' is to you—an alien essence. [...] Alienness is a criterion of the "sacred" [''Ibidem'', Cambridge edition, pp. 37–38].}}

The contrast is also expressed in terms of the difference between the voluntary egoist being the possessor of his concepts as opposed to being possessed. Only when one realizes that all sacred truths such as [[law]], [[Rights|right]], [[morality]], [[religion]] and so on are nothing other than artificial concepts and not to be obeyed can one act freely. For Stirner, to be free is to be both one's own "creature" (in the sense of 'creation') and one's own "creator" (dislocating the traditional role assigned to the gods). To Stirner, power is the method of egoism. It is the only justified method of gaining '[[property]]'. Even [[love]] is explained as "consciously egoistic": {{quotation|[L]ove cuts no better figure than any other passion [if] I obey [it] blindly. The ambitious man, who is carried away by ambition [...] has let this passion grow up into a despot against whom he abandons all power of dissolution; he has given up himself because he cannot ''dissolve'' himself, and consequently cannot absolve himself from the passion: he is possessed.

I love men too—not merely individuals, but every one. But I love them with the consciousness of my egoism; I love them because love makes ''me'' happy, I love because loving is natural to me, it pleases me. I know no 'commandment of love'. I have a ''fellow-feeling'' with every feeling being, and their torment torments, their refreshment refreshes me too [''Ibidem'', p. 258].}}

However, Stirner cautioned against any [[Reification (fallacy)|reification]] of the egoist or subject: {{quotation|The egoist, before whom the humane shudder, is a spook as much as the devil is: he exists only as a bogie and phantasm in their brain. If they were not unsophisticatedly drifting back and forth in the antediluvian opposition of good and evil, to which they have given the modern names of "human" and "egoistic," they would not have freshened up the hoary "sinner" into an "egoist" either, and put a new patch on an old garment [Second Part: The Owner: 3 – My Self Enjoyment].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lsr-projekt.de/poly/enee.html#secondii3 ''Max Stirner - The Ego and Its Own''].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Anarchism ===
{{main|Egoist anarchism|Individualist anarchism in Europe}}
Stirner proposes that most commonly accepted social institutions&amp;mdash;including the notion of state, property as a right, [[natural rights]] in general and the very notion of society&amp;mdash;were mere illusions or ''ghosts'' in the mind, saying of society that "the individuals are its reality". Stirner wants to "abolish not only the state but also society as an institution responsible for its members".&lt;ref&gt;Heider, Ulrike. ''Anarchism: Left, Right and Green'', San Francisco: City Lights Books, 1994, pp. 95–96.&lt;/ref&gt;

He advocated egoism and a form of [[amoralism]] in which individuals would unite in "[[Union of egoists]]" only when it was in their self-interest to do so. For him, property simply comes about through might: "Whoever knows how to take, to defend, the thing, to him belongs property. [...] "What I have in my power, that is my own. So long as I assert myself as holder, I am the proprietor of the thing". He says: "I do not step shyly back from your property, but look upon it always as my property, in which I respect nothing. Pray do the like with what you call my property!".&lt;ref name="Stirner, Max p. 248"&gt;Stirner, Max. ''The Ego and Its Own''. p. 248.&lt;/ref&gt; Stirner considers the world and everything in it, including other persons, available to one's taking or use without moral constraint&lt;ref name="Moggach, Douglas p. 194"&gt;Moggach, Douglas. The New Hegelians. Cambridge University Press, 2006 p. 194.&lt;/ref&gt;—that rights do not exist in regard to objects and people at all. He sees no rationality in taking the interests of others into account unless doing so furthers one's self-interest, which he believes is the only legitimate reason for acting. He denies society as being an actual entity: "The conquerors form a society which one may imagine so great that it by degrees embraces all humanity; but so-called humanity too is as such only a thought (spook); the individuals are its reality" (''The Ego and Its Own'', Tucker ed., p.&amp;nbsp;329).

Stirner never referred to markets and his philosophy on property causes problems for a market system because—according to proponents of markets—property is not considered to be legitimate if taken by force. Stirner was opposed to communism, seeing it as a form of authority over the individual. He said in ''The Ego and Its Own'': {{quotation|All attempts to enact rational laws about property have put out from the bay of ''love'' into a desolate sea of regulations. Even Socialism and Communism cannot be excepted from this. Everyone one is to be provided with adequate means, for which it is little to the point whether one socialistically finds them still in a personal property, or communistically draws them from a [[Common ownership|community of goods]]. The individual's mind in this remains the same; it remains a mind of dependence. The distributing ''board of equity'' lets me have only what the sense of equity, its ''loving'' care for all, prescribes. For me, the individual, there lies no less of a check in collective wealth than in that of ''individual others''; neither that is mind, nor this: whether the wealth belongs to the collectivity, which confers part of it on me, or to individual possessors, is for me the same constraint, as I cannot decide about either of the two. One the Contrary, Communism, by the abolition of all personal property, only presses me back still more into dependence on another, ''viz.'', on the generality or collectivity; and, loudly as it always attacks the "State," what it intends is itself again a State, a ''status'', a condition hindering my free movement, a sovereign power over me. Communism rightly revolts against the pressure I experience from individual proprietors; but still more horrible is the might that it puts in the hands of the collectivity. Egoism takes another way to root out the non-possessing rabble. It does not say: Wait for what the board of equity will—bestow on you in the name of the collectivity (for such bestowal took place in "States" from the most ancient times, each receiving "according to his desert," and therefore according to the measure in which each was able to ''deserve'' it, to acquire it by ''service''), but: Take hold, and take what you require! With this the war of all against all is declared. ''I'' alone decide what I will have.&lt;ref&gt;Stirner, Max. ''The Ego and Its Own''. Rebel Press. 1982. p. 257.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==== Property ====
Stirner has a concept of "egoistic property" in which he is referring to the absence of moral restrictions on how the individual uses everything in the world, including other people.&lt;ref name="Moggach, Douglas p. 194"/&gt; For Stirner, property come about through might: "Whoever knows how to take, to defend, the thing, to him belongs property. [...] What I have in my power, that is my own. So long as I assert myself as holder, I am the proprietor of the thing". He says: "I do not step shyly back from your property, but look upon it always as my property, in which I respect nothing. Pray do the like with what you call my property!".&lt;ref name="Stirner, Max p. 248"/&gt; This position on property is much different from the then prevalent form of individualist anarchism, which defended the inviolability of the private property that has been earned through labour.&lt;ref&gt;Weir, David. Anarchy &amp; Culture. [[University of Massachusetts Press]]. 1997. p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[American individualist anarchist]] [[Benjamin Tucker]] rejected the [[natural rights]] philosophy and adopted Stirner's egoism in 1886, with several others joining with him. Since he was a radical anarchist, he preferred a political-economic social condition that was anti-statist, anti-capitalist and anti-authoritarian completely void of authoritarian monopolies (whether they positioned themselves as property or sovereignty) which were the enemies of individual liberation. Stirner's egoist anarchism is all about freeing the individual from the domination of property monopolists such as monarchs, governments, or industrialists while at the same time it positions itself against the anti-individualist nature of the traditional political left. Stirner had no concrete dogma on the issue of property and simply urged individuals to stop being ruled by others regardless of the authorities' moral claims about political sovereignty or property rights.

==== Union of egoists ====
{{main|Union of egoists}}
Stirner's idea of the "Union of egoists" was first expounded in ''The Ego and Its Own''. The Union is understood as a non-systematic association, which Stirner proposed in contradistinction to the [[Sovereign state|state]].&lt;ref name=karl&gt;{{cite book|last=Thomas|first=Paul|title=Karl Marx and the Anarchists|publisher=[[Routledge]]/[[Kegan Paul]]|location=London|year=1985|isbn=0-7102-0685-2|pages=142}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Union is understood as a relation between egoists which is continually renewed by all parties' support through an act of will.&lt;ref name=nonserviam&gt;{{citation|url=http://i-studies.com/journal/n/pdf/nsi-17.pdf#page=13|title=The union of egoists|journal=Non Serviam|volume=1|first=Svein Olav|last=Nyberg|pages=13–14|location=Oslo, Norway|publisher=Svein Olav Nyberg|oclc=47758413|accessdate=1 September 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101207042220/http://i-studies.com/journal/n/pdf/nsi-17.pdf#page=13|archivedate=7 December 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Union requires that all parties participate out of a [[Selfishness|conscious egoism]]. If one party silently finds themselves to be suffering, but puts up and keeps the appearance, the union has degenerated into something else.&lt;ref name=nonserviam/&gt; This Union is not seen as an [[authority]] above a person's own will.

==== Revolution ====
Stirner criticizes conventional notions of [[revolution]], arguing that [[social movement]]s aimed at overturning the state are tacitly statist because they are implicitly aimed at the establishment of a new state thereafter. To illustrate this argument, he compares his own social and moral role with that of [[Jesus Christ]]: {{quotation|The time [in which Jesus lived] was politically so agitated that, as is said in the gospels, people thought they could not accuse the founder of Christianity more successfully than if they arraigned him for 'political intrigue', and yet the same gospels report that he was precisely the one who took the least part in these political doings.  But why was he not a revolutionary, not a demagogue, as the Jews would gladly have seen him? [...] Because he expected no salvation from a change of conditions, and this whole business was indifferent to him.  He was not a revolutionary, like Caesar, but an insurgent: not a state-overturner, but one who straightened himself up. [...] [Jesus] was not carrying on any liberal or political fight against the established authorities, but wanted to walk his own way, untroubled about, and undisturbed by, these authorities. [...] But, even though not a ringleader of popular mutiny, not a demagogue or revolutionary, he (and every one of the ancient Christians) was so much the more an insurgent who lifted himself above everything that seemed so sublime to the government and its opponents, and absolved himself from everything that they remained bound to [...]; precisely because he put from him the upsetting of the established, he was its deadly enemy and real annihilator[.]|Max Stirner|''The Ego and Its Own'', pp. 280–281}}

As Stirner specifies in a footnote (p.&amp;nbsp;280), he was here using the word [[Insurgency|insurgent]] "in its [[etymological]] sense", therefore to rise above the religion and government of one's own times and to take control of one's life with no consideration of them, but not necessarily to overthrow them. This contrasts with the method of the revolutionary who brings about a change of conditions by displacing one government with another: {{quotation|The revolution aimed at new arrangements; insurrection leads us no longer to let ourselves be arranged, but to arrange ourselves, and sets no glittering hopes on 'institutions'.  It is not a fight against the established [...] it is only a working forth of me out of the established. [...] Now, as my object is not an overthrow of the established order but my elevation above it, my purpose and deed are not political or social but (as directed toward myself and my ownness alone) an egoistic purpose indeed.|Max Stirner|''The Ego and Its Own'', p. 280}}

Stirner was writing about people liberating themselves from their own limits and rising above limiting social, political and ideological conditions and for each to walk their own way. The passages quoted above are clearly incompatible with David Leopold's conclusion (in his introduction to the [[Cambridge University Press]] edition) that Stirner "saw humankind as 'fretted in dark superstition' but denied that he sought their enlightenment and welfare" (''Ibidem'', p. xxxii). Stirner refused to describe himself as directly liberating others, but his stated purpose in these quotations seems to be to achieve the "enlightenment and welfare" of others by way of demonstration and "[[insurrection]]" as he defines it.

=== Dogma ===
The passages quoted above show the few points of contact between Stirner's philosophy and [[early Christianity]]. It is merely Jesus as an "annihilator" of the established biases and preconceptions of Rome that Stirner can relate to. His reason for "citing" the cultural change sparked by Jesus is that he wants the Christian ideologies of 19th century Europe to collapse, much as the ideology of heathen Rome did before it (e.g. "[the Christian era] will end with the casting off of the ideal, with 'contempt for the spirit'", p.&amp;nbsp;320). As with the [[Skepticism|classical skeptics]] before him, Stirner's method of self-liberation is opposed to faith or belief and he envisions a life free from "dogmatic presuppositions" (p.&amp;nbsp;135, 309) or any "fixed standpoint" (p.&amp;nbsp;295). It is not merely Christian [[dogma]] that his thought repudiates, but also a wide variety of European atheist ideologies that are condemned as [[Crypto-Christianity|crypto-Christian]] for putting ideas in an equivalent role: {{quotation|Among many transformations, the Holy Spirit became in time the 'absolute idea' [in Hegelian philosophy], which again in manifold refractions split into the different ideas of philanthropy, reasonableness, civic virtue, and so on. [...] Antiquity, at its close, had gained its ownership of the world only when it had broken the world's overpoweringness and 'divinity', recognised the world's powerlessness and 'vanity'. [...] [The philosophers of our time say] Concepts are to decide everywhere, concepts to regulate life, concepts to rule.  This is the religious world [of our time], to which Hegel gave a systematic expression, bringing method into the nonsense and completing the conceptual precepts into a rounded, firmly-based dogmatic.  Everything is sung according to concepts and the real man, I, am compelled to live according to these conceptual laws. [...] [[Liberalism]] simply replaced [[Christian]] concepts with [[Humanism|humanist]] ones; human instead of divine, political instead of ecclesiastical, 'scientific' instead of doctrinal etc.|Max Stirner|''The Ego and Its Own'', pp. 87–88}}
{{quotation|The thinker is distinguished from the believer only by believing much more than the latter, who, on his part, thinks of much less as signified by his faith (creed). The thinker has a thousand tenets of faith where the believer gets along with few; but the former brings coherence into his tenets, and take the coherence in turn for the scale to estimate their worth by. p. 304}}

What Stirner proposes is not that concepts should rule people, but that people should rule concepts. The "nothingness" of all truth is rooted in the "nothingness" of the self because the ego is the criterion of (dogmatic) truth. Again, Stirner seems closely comparable to the skeptics in that his radical [[epistemology]] directs us to emphasise [[empirical]] experience (the "unmediated" relationship of mind as world and world as mind), but it leaves only a very limited validity to the category of "truth". When we regard the impressions of the senses with detachment, simply for what they are (e.g. neither good nor evil), we may still correctly assign truth to them: {{quotation|Christianity took away from the things of this world only their irresistibleness [...]. In like manner I raise myself above truths and their power: as I am above the sensual, so I am above the truth.  Before me truths are as common and as indifferent as things; they do not carry me away, and do not inspire me with enthusiasm.  There exists not even one truth, not right, not freedom, humanity, etc., that has stability before me, and to which I subject myself. [...] In words and truths [...] there is no salvation for me, as little as there is for the Christian in things and vanities.  As the riches of this world do not make me happy, so neither do its truths. [...] Along with worldly goods, all sacred goods too must be put away as no longer valuable. (p. 307)}}
{{quotation|Truths are material, like vegetables and weeds; as to whether vegetable or weed, the decision lies in me. (p. 313)}}

In place of such systems of beliefs, Stirner presents a detached life of non-dogmatic, open-minded engagement with the world "as it is" (unpolluted by "faith" of any kind, Christian or humanist), coupled with the awareness that there is no soul, no personal essence of any kind, but that the individual's uniqueness consists solely in its "creative nothingness" prior to all concepts.

== Hegel's possible influence ==
Scholar Lawrence Stepelevich argues that [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] was a major influence on ''The Ego and Its Own''. While the latter has an "un-Hegelian structure and tone" on the whole and is hostile to Hegel's conclusions about the self and the world, Stepelevich argues that Stirner's work is best understood as answering Hegel's question of the role of consciousness after it has contemplated "untrue knowledge" and become "absolute knowledge". Stirner, Stepelevich concludes, presents the consequences of the rediscovering one's self-consciousness after realizing self-determination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stepelevich|first1=Lawrence S.|title=Max Stirner as Hegelian|journal=[[Journal of the History of Ideas]]|volume=46|issue=4|pages=597–614|date=1985|doi=10.2307/2709548|issn=0022-5037|jstor=2709548}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Widukind De Ridder has argued that scholars who take Stirner's references to Hegel and the [[Young Hegelians]] as expressions of his own alleged [[Hegelianism]] are highly mistaken. De Ridder argues that ''The Ego and Its Own'' is in part a carefully constructed parody of Hegelianism, deliberately exposing its outwornness as a system of thought; and that Stirner's notions of "ownness" and "egoism" were part of his radical criticism of the implicit teleology of Hegelian dialectics.&lt;ref&gt;De Ridder, Widukind, "Max Stirner, Hegel and the Young Hegelians: A reassessment". In: History of European Ideas, 2008, 285–297.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Influence ==
Stirner was a philosopher whose "name appears with familiar regularity in historically-orientated surveys of anarchist thought as one of the earliest and best-known exponents of individualist anarchism".&lt;ref  name="SEP"&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/max-stirner/ Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy entry for Max Stirner].&lt;/ref&gt; In 1844, his ''The Ego and Its Own'' (''Der Einzige und sein Eigentum'' which may literally be translated as ''The Unique Individual and His Property'')&lt;ref&gt;Moggach, Douglas. The New Hegelians. Cambridge University Press. p. 177.&lt;/ref&gt; was published and it is considered to be "a founding text in the tradition of individualist anarchism".&lt;ref name="SEP"/&gt;

'''José de la Cruz Porfirio Díaz Mori''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|iː|ə|s}};&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dictionary.com/browse/diaz "Díaz"]. ''[[Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPA-es|poɾˈfiɾjo ði.as|lang}}; 15 September 1830 – 2 July 1915) was a [[Mexico|Mexican]] general and politician who served seven terms as [[President of Mexico]], a total of three and a half decades, from 1876 to 1880 and from 1884 to 1911. A veteran of the [[Reform War|War of the Reform]] (1858–60) and the [[French intervention in Mexico]] (1862–67), Díaz rose to the rank of [[General (Mexico)|General]], leading republican troops against the French-imposed rule of [[Maximilian I of Mexico|Emperor Maximilian]]. Seizing power in a coup in 1876, Díaz and his allies, a group of [[Technocracy|technocrats]] known as "[[Científico]]s",&lt;ref&gt;Mary Kay Vaughan, "Científicos" in ''Encyclopedia of Latin American History and Culture'', vol. 2, p. 155. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; ruled Mexico for the next thirty-five years, a period known as the ''[[Porfiriato]]''.

Díaz has always been a controversial figure in Mexican history; while the Porfirian regime brought stability after decades of conflict, it grew unpopular due to civil repression and political stagnation. His economic policies largely benefited his circle of allies as well as foreign investors, and helped a few wealthy [[Hacienda|estate-owning]] [[wiktionary:hacendado|hacendados]] acquire huge areas of land, leaving rural ''[[wiktionary:campesino|campesinos]]'' unable to make a living. Likewise these estates were often deadly, resulting in the deaths of 600,000 workers in 1900 through the end of Diaz's rule. Despite public statements favoring a return to democracy and not running for office, Díaz reversed himself and ran again in 1910. His failure to institutionalize presidential succession, as he was by then 80 years old, triggered a political crisis between the Científicos and the followers of General [[Bernardo Reyes]], allied with the military and with peripheral regions of Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;Vaughan, "Cientificos", p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt; After Díaz declared himself the winner of an eighth term in office in 1910, his electoral opponent, [[Francisco I. Madero]], issued a [[Plan of San Luis Potosí|call for armed rebellion]] against Díaz, leading to the outbreak of the [[Mexican Revolution]]. After the [[Federal Army]] suffered a number of military defeats against Madero's forces, Díaz was [[Treaty of Ciudad Juárez|forced to resign]] in May 1911 and went into exile in [[French Third Republic|France]], where he died four years later.

== Early years ==
[[File:Mamadeporfirio.jpg|thumb|upright|María Mori Cortés, mother of Porfirio Díaz, in a photograph made around 1854 in Oaxaca.]]
Porfirio Díaz was the sixth of seven children, baptized on 15 September 1830, in [[Oaxaca City|Oaxaca, Mexico]], but his actual date of birth is unknown.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Garner|2001|pp=25, 44, n.4}}&lt;/ref&gt; September 15 is an important date in Mexican history, the eve of the day when hero of independence [[Miguel Hidalgo]] issued his call for independence in 1810; when Díaz became president, the independence anniversary was commemorated on September 15 rather than on the 16th, a practice that continues to the present era.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Garner|2001|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Díaz was a [[castizo]].&lt;ref name="Garner_25"&gt;{{harvp|Garner|2001|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; His mother, Petrona Mori (or Mory), was the daughter of a man whose father had immigrated from Spain and Tecla Cortés, an indigenous woman; Díaz's father was a [[Criollo people|Criollo]].&lt;ref name="Garner_25" /&gt;&lt;ref name="brit" /&gt; There is confusion about his father's name, which is listed on the baptismal certificate as José de la Cruz Díaz; he was also known as José Faustino Díaz, and was a modest innkeeper who died of cholera when his son was three.&lt;ref name="Garner_25" /&gt;&lt;ref name="brit"&gt;{{harvp|Britannica|1993|p=70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the family's difficult economic circumstances following Díaz's father's death in 1833, Díaz was sent to school at age 6.&lt;ref name="Garner_26"&gt;{{harvp|Garner|2001|p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early independence period, the choice of professions was narrow: lawyer, priest, physician, military. The Díaz family was devoutly religious, and Díaz began training for the priesthood at the age of fifteen when his mother, María Petrona Mori Cortés, sent him to the Colegio Seminario Conciliar de Oaxaca. He was offered a post as a priest in 1846, but national events intervened. Díaz joined with seminary students who volunteered as soldiers to repel the U.S. invasion during the [[Mexican–American War]], and, despite not seeing action, decided his future was in the military, not the priesthood.&lt;ref name="Garner_26" /&gt; Also in 1846, Díaz came into contact with a leading Oaxaca liberal, Marcos Pérez, who taught at the secular Institute of Arts and Sciences in Oaxaca. That same year, Díaz met [[Benito Juárez]], who became governor of Oaxaca in 1847, a former student there.&lt;ref name="Garner_27"&gt;{{harvp|Garner|2001|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1849, over the objections of his family, Díaz abandoned his ecclesiastical career and entered the Instituto de Ciencias and studied law.&lt;ref name="brit" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Garner_27" /&gt; When [[Antonio López de Santa Anna]] was returned to power by a coup d'état in 1853, he suspended the 1824 constitution and began persecuting liberals. At this point, Díaz had already aligned himself with radical liberals (''rojos''), such as Benito Juárez. Juárez was forced into exile in New Orleans; Díaz supported the liberal [[Plan de Ayutla]] that called for the ouster of Santa Anna. Díaz evaded an arrest warrant and fled to the mountains of northern Oaxaca, where he joined the rebellion of [[Juan Álvarez]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Garner|2001|pp=35, 241}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1855, Díaz joined a band of liberal guerrillas who were fighting Santa Anna's government. After the ousting and exile of Santa Anna, Díaz was rewarded with a post in [[Ixtlán de Juárez|Ixtlán]], Oaxaca, that gave him valuable practical experience as an administrator.

== Life as a military man and path to the presidency ==
{{refimprove section|date=May 2013}}

Díaz's military career is most notable for his service in the [[Reform War]] and the [[French intervention in Mexico|struggle against the French]]. By the time of the [[Battle of Puebla]] (5 May 1862), Mexico's great victory over the French when they first invaded, Díaz had advanced to the rank of general and was placed in command of an infantry brigade.&lt;ref name="brit"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Garza, James A., "Porfirio Díaz" in ''Encyclopedia of Mexico'', Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn 1997, p. 406.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Battle of Puebla, his brigade was positioned centered between the forts of Loreto and Guadalupe. From there, he successfully helped repel a French infantry attack meant as a diversion, to distract the Mexican commanders' attention from the forts that were the French army's main targets. In violation of General [[Ignacio Zaragoza]]'s orders, after helping fight off the larger French force, General Díaz and his unit then chased after them. Despite Díaz's inability to cede control, General Zaragoza commended his actions during the battle as "brave and notable".

[[File:13488 2 de abril de 1867. Entrada del general Porfirio Díaz a Puebla.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Third Battle of Puebla]] during the [[Franco-Mexican War]], oil painting on canvas depicting an entrance of Porfirio Díaz to Puebla, April 2, 1867]]

In 1863, Díaz was captured by the French Army. He escaped and President [[Benito Juárez]] offered him the positions of secretary of defense or army commander in chief. He declined both, but took an appointment as commander of the Central Army. That same year, he was promoted to the position of Division General.

In 1864, the conservatives supporting [[Maximilian I of Mexico|Emperor Maximilian]] asked him to join the Imperial cause. Díaz declined the offer. In 1865, he was captured by the Imperial forces in Oaxaca. He escaped and fought the battles of Tehuitzingo, Piaxtla, Tulcingo and Comitlipa.

In 1866, Díaz formally declared loyalty. That same year, he earned victories in Nochixtlán, [[Battle of Miahuatlán|Miahuatlán]], and [[Battle of La Carbonera|La Carbonera]], and once again captured Oaxaca. He was then promoted to general. Also in 1866, [[François Achille Bazaine|Marshal Bazaine]], commander of the Imperial forces, offered to surrender [[Mexico City]] to Díaz if he withdrew support of Juárez. Díaz declined the offer. In 1867, Emperor Maximilian offered Díaz the command of the army and the imperial rendition to the liberal cause. Díaz refused both. Finally, on 2 April 1867, he went on to win the final battle for Puebla.

[[File:Young Porfirio Diaz.jpg|thumb|upright|Colonel Porfirio Díaz, 1861. At this time, Díaz was a Federal Deputy and had participated in two wars, namely the [[Revolution of Ayutla]] (1854–55) and the [[Reform War|War of the Reform]] (1857–1861).]]

Five days later, Díaz married [[Delfina Ortega Díaz]] (1845–1880), the daughter of his sister, Manuela Josefa Díaz Mori (1824–1856). Díaz and his niece would have seven children, but Delfina died due to complications of her seventh delivery.

When Juárez became the president of Mexico in 1868 and began to restore peace, Díaz resigned his military command and went home to Oaxaca. However, it wasn't long before the energetic Díaz became unhappy with the Juárez administration.

In 1871, Díaz led a revolt against the re-election of Juárez. In March 1872, Díaz's forces were defeated in the battle of La Bufa in [[Zacatecas City|Zacatecas]]. Following Juárez's death on 9 July of that year, [[Sebastián Lerdo de Tejada]] assumed the presidency and offered amnesty to the rebels. Díaz accepted in October and "retired" to the Hacienda de la Candelaria in [[Tlacotalpan, Veracruz]]. However, he remained very popular among the people of Mexico.

In 1874, he was elected to Congress from [[Veracruz]]. That year, Lerdo de Tejada's government faced civil and military unrest, and offered Díaz the position of ambassador to Germany, which he refused. In 1875, Díaz traveled to New Orleans and [[Brownsville, Texas]] to plan a rebellion, which was launched in Ojitlan, Oaxaca, on 10 January 1876 as the "[[Plan of Tuxtepec|Plan de Tuxtepec]]".

Díaz continued to be an outspoken citizen and led a second revolt against Lerdo de Tejada in 1876. This attempt also failed and Díaz fled to the United States of America.&lt;ref name="brit" /&gt; His fight, however, was far from over.

Several months later, in November 1876, Díaz returned to Mexico and fought the [[Battle of Tecoac]], where he defeated the government forces once and for all (on 16 November). Finally, on 12 May 1877, Díaz was elected president of Mexico for the first time.&lt;ref name="brit" /&gt; His campaign of "no re-election", however, came to define his control over the state for more than thirty years.

== The campaigns of "no-reelection" ==
[[File:AntireelecionistaPosadaDF.JPG|thumb|left|upright|"Manifestación antireeleccionista" by José Guadalupe Posada]]
As a Liberal military hero, Díaz had ambitions for national political power. He challenged the civilian president Benito Juárez, who was running for what Díaz considered an illegal subsequent term as president. In 1870, Díaz ran against President Juárez and Vice President [[Sebastián Lerdo de Tejada]]. In 1871, he made claims of fraud in the July elections won by Juárez, who was confirmed as president by the Congress in October. In response, Díaz launched the ''[[Plan de la Noria]]'' on 8 November 1871, supported by a number of rebellions across the nation, including one by [[Manuel González Flores|Manuel González]] of Tamaulipas, but this rebellion failed.&lt;ref name="Garner_245"&gt;{{harvp|Garner|2001|p=245}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the death of Juárez of natural causes in 1872, Lerdo became president. Lerdo offered amnesty to rebels, which Díaz accepted and took up residency in Veracruz.&lt;ref name="Garner_245"/&gt; In 1874, Díaz served in the legislature, representing Veracruz. Opposition to the presidency of Lerdo grew, particularly as anti-clericalism increased, labor unrest grew, and a major rebellion of the [[Yaqui]] in northwest Mexico under the leadership of [[Cajeme]] challenged central government rule there.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Garner|2001|p=246}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Díaz saw an opportunity to plot a more successful rebellion, leaving Mexico in 1875 for New Orleans and Brownsville, Texas with his political ally Manuel González.

When Lerdo declared he was running for re-election in 1876, Díaz once again had the pretext of the principle of no-reelection to support his opposition. He issued the [[Plan of Tuxtepec]] (a town in Oaxaca) as a call to arms against Lerdo. When Lerdo was re-elected in July 1876, rebellion and unrest both before and after the election forced Lerdo from office. In November 1876, Díaz occupied Mexico City, Lerdo left Mexico for exile in New York. Díaz did not take formal control of the presidency until the beginning of 1877, putting General [[Juan N. Méndez]] as provisional president, followed by new presidential elections in 1877 that gave Díaz the presidency. Ironically, one of his government's first amendments to the 1857 liberal constitution was to prevent re-election.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Garner|2001|p=247}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the liberals had defeated the conservatives in the War of the Reform, the conservatives had been powerful enough still in the early 1860s to aid the imperial project of France that put Maximilian Habsburg as emperor of Mexico. With the fall of Maximilian, Mexican conservatives were cast as collaborators with foreign imperialists. With the return of the liberals under Benito Juárez, and following his death, liberals held power, but basic liberal goals of democracy, rule of law, and economic development were not reached.&lt;ref name="Garner_69"&gt;{{harvp|Garner|2001|p=69}}&lt;/ref&gt; Díaz saw his task in his term as president to create internal order so that economic development could be possible. As a military hero and astute politician, Díaz's eventual successful establishment of that peace (Pax Porfiriana) became "one of [Díaz's] principal achievements, and it became the main justification for successive re-elections after 1884."&lt;ref name="Garner_69"/&gt;

==The Porfiriato==
During his first term in office, Díaz developed a pragmatic and personalist approach to solve political conflicts. Although a political liberal who had stood with radical liberals in Oaxaca (rojos), he was not a liberal ideologue, preferring pragmatic approaches towards political issues. He was explicit about his pragmatism. He maintained control through generous patronage to political allies.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Garner|2001|p=70}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although he was an authoritarian ruler, he maintained the structure of elections, so that there was the façade of liberal democracy. His administration became famous for suppression of civil society and public revolts. One of the catch phrases of his later terms in office was the choice between "pan o palo", ("bread or the bludgeon")—that is, "benevolence or repression."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Krauze|1997|p=212}}&lt;/ref&gt; To secure U.S. government recognition of the Díaz regime, which had come to power by a coup despite the later niceties of an election after Lerdo went into exile, Mexico paid $300,000 to settle claims by the U.S. In 1878, the U.S. government recognized the Díaz regime and former U.S. president and Civil War hero Ulysses S. Grant visited Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Garner|2001|pp=247–248}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During The Porfiriato, Diaz modernized different aspects of Mexico's infrastructure, such as a tenfold increase in railways, steam-powered locomotives, and telegraph lines across the country. These improvements were mainly backed by foreign capital and were done to benefit his close supporters and foreign investors. On the other hand, Diaz showed less concern for the common Mexican people. During 1883-1894, laws were passed to give fewer and fewer people large amounts of land. Land was taken away from people by bribing local judges to declare them vacant. Díaz's friend obtained 12 million acres of land in Baja California by bribing local judges. Those who opposed were killed or captured and sold as slaves to plantations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/915135785|title=A history of modern Latin America : 1800 to the present|last=1948-|first=Meade, Teresa A.,|isbn=9781118772485|edition=Second|location=Chichester, West Sussex|oclc=915135785}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Diaz initially served only one term — after having staunchly stood against Lerdo's re-election policy. Instead of running for a second term, he handpicked his successor, [[Manuel González Flores|Manuel González]], one of his trustworthy companions.&lt;ref name="brit" /&gt; This side-step maneuver, however, did not mean that Díaz was stepping down from his powerful position. The four-year period that followed was marked by corruption and official incompetence, so that when Díaz stepped up in the election of 1884, he was welcomed by his people with open arms.&lt;ref name="brit" /&gt; More importantly, very few people remembered his "No re-election" slogan that had defined his previous campaign. During this period the Mexican underground political newspapers spread the new ironic slogan for the Porfirian times, based on the slogan "''Sufragio Efectivo, No Reelección''" (effective suffrage, no re-election) and changed it to "''Sufragio Efectivo No, Reelección''" (no effective suffrage, re-election).&lt;ref name="Buckman"&gt;{{cite book |title=The World Today Series: Latin America 2007 |last=Buckman |first=Robert T. |authorlink= |year=2007 |publisher=Stryker-Post Publications |location=Harpers Ferry, West Virginia |ISBN=978-1-887985-84-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; In any case, Díaz had the constitution amended, first to allow two terms in office, and then to remove all restrictions on re-election.

With these changes in place, Díaz was re-elected four more times by implausibly high margins, and on some occasions claimed to have won with either unanimous or near-unanimous support.&lt;ref name="Buckman"/&gt;

== Political career ==
[[File:Porfirio Diaz in uniform.jpg|thumb|upright|Porfirio Díaz]]
Having created a band of military brothers, Díaz went on to construct a broad coalition.&lt;ref name="skidmore"&gt;{{harvp|Skidmore|Smith|1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a cunning politician and knew very well how to manipulate people to his advantage. A phrase used to describe the order of his rule was ''pan o palo'' ("bread or a beating"—literally "bread or the club"), meaning that one could either accept what was given willingly (often a position of political power) or else face harsh consequences (often death). Either way, rising opposition to Díaz's administration was immediately quelled.&lt;ref name="crow" /&gt;

Over the next twenty-six years as president, Díaz created a systematic and methodical regime with a staunch military mindset.&lt;ref name="brit" /&gt; His first goal was to establish peace throughout Mexico. According to John A. Crow, Díaz "set out to establish a good strong ''paz porfiriana,'' or Porfirian peace, of such scope and firmness that it would redeem the country in the eyes of the world for its sixty-five years of revolution and anarchy."&lt;ref name="crow" /&gt; His second goal was outlined in his motto – "little of politics and plenty of administration."&lt;ref name="crow" /&gt;

[[File:Piedra_del_sol_Porfirio_Diaz.png|thumb|left|Porfirio Díaz in 1910 at the [[National Museum of Anthropology (Mexico)|National Museum of Anthropology]] with the [[Aztec Calendar Stone]].]]
In reality, he started a Mexican revolution; however, his fight for profits, control, and progress kept his people in a constant state of uncertainty. Díaz managed to dissolve all local authorities and all aspects of federalism that once existed. Not long after he became president, the governors of all federal states in Mexico answered directly to him.&lt;ref name="brit" /&gt; Those who held high positions of power, such as members of the legislature, were almost entirely his closest and most loyal friends. In his quest for even more political control, Díaz suppressed the media and controlled the court system.&lt;ref name="brit" /&gt;

In order to secure his power, Díaz engaged in various forms of co-optation and coercion. He constantly balanced between the private desires of different interest groups and playing off one interest against another.&lt;ref name="brit" /&gt; In order to satisfy any competing forces, such as the [[Mestizo]]s and wealthier indigenous people, he gave them political positions of power that they could not refuse. He did the same thing with the elite [[Creole peoples|Creole]] society by not interfering with their wealth and haciendas. Covering both pro and anti-clerical elements, Díaz was both the head of the Freemasons in Mexico and an important advisor to the Catholic bishops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Zayas Enríquez, Rafael|title=Porfirio Díaz|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JS9JAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA31|year=1908|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Díaz proved to be a different kind of liberal than those of the past. He neither assaulted the Church (like most liberals) nor protected the Church.&lt;ref name="skidmore" /&gt; As for the Native American population, who were historically repressed, they were almost completely depoliticized; neither put on a pedestal as the core of Mexican society nor suppressed, and were largely left to advance by their own means. In giving different groups with potential power a taste of what they wanted, Díaz created the illusion of democracy and quelled almost all competing forces.

Díaz knew that it was crucial for him to suppress banditry; he expanded the [[Rurales|''guardias rurales'']] (countryside police), although it guarded chiefly only transport routes to major cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Vanderwood|1970}}&lt;/ref&gt; Díaz thus worked to enhance his control over the military and the police.&lt;ref name="skidmore"/&gt;

During the Díaz regime, the state began to take control over the cultural patrimony of Mexico, expanding the [[National Museum of Anthropology (Mexico)|National Museum of Anthropology]] as the central repository of artifacts from Mexico's archeological sites, as well as asserting control over the sites themselves.  The Law of Monuments (1897) gave jurisdiction over archeological sites to the federal government. This allowed the expropriation and expulsion of peasants who had been cultivating crops on the archeological sites, most systematically done at [[Teotihuacan]].  Former cavalry officer and archeologist [[Leopoldo Batres]] was Inspector of Archeological Monuments and wielded considerable power. He garnered resources from the Díaz government funds to guard archeological sites in central Mexico and Yucatan, as well as to hire workers to excavate archeological sites of particular importance for creating an image of Mexico's glorious past to foreign scholars and tourists, as well as patriotic fervor in Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;Christina Bueno, ''The Pursuit of Ruins: Archeology, History, and the Making of Modern Mexico''. Albuquerque: University of New Mexico Press 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1892 onwards, Díaz's perennial opponent was the eccentric [[Nicolás Zúñiga y Miranda]], who lost every election but always claimed fraud and considered himself to be the legitimately elected president of Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://eleconomista.com.mx/entretenimiento/2012/07/30/zuniga-miranda-presidente-legitimo|title=Zúñiga y Miranda, "Presidente legítimo"|last=Colín|first=Ricardo Pacheco|language=es|access-date=2017-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Porfirio Díaz and the Catholic Church ==
[[File:Porfirio Diaz.jpg|left|upright|thumb|Porfirio Díaz]]

Díaz came from a devoutly Catholic family; his uncle, José Agustín, was bishop of Oaxaca. Díaz had trained for the priesthood, and it seemed likely that was his career path. Oaxaca was a center of liberalism, and the founding of the Institute of Arts and Sciences, a secular institution, helped foster professional training for Oaxacan liberals, including Benito Juárez and Porfirio Díaz. Díaz was a [[Freemason]], which did not necessarily{{clarify|date=May 2015}} put him at odds with the Catholic Church, but did give him access to a secret brotherhood of like-minded ambitious men.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

Radical liberalism was anti-clerical, seeing the privileges of the Church as challenging the idea of equality before the law and individual, rather than corporate identity. The economic power of the Church was considered a detriment to modernization and development. The Church as a major corporate landowner and ''de facto'' banking institution shaped investments to conservative landed estates more than industry, infrastructure building, or exports. When Díaz abandoned his ecclesiastical career for one in the military, his powerful uncle disowned him.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Krauze|1997|p=213}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike many doctrinaire liberals, Díaz was not virulently anti-clerical. However, powerful liberals following the ouster of Santa Anna had moved to implement legal measures to curtail the power of the Church. The Juárez Law abolished special privileges (fueros) of ecclesiastics and the military, and the [[Lerdo law]] mandated disentailment of the property of corporations, specifically the Church and indigenous communities. The liberal constitution of 1857 removed the privileged position of the Catholic Church and opened the way to religious toleration, considering religious expression as freedom of speech. However, Catholic priests were ineligible for elective office, but could vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Mecham|1934|p=437}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conservatives fought back in the War of the Reform, under the banner of ''religión y fueros'' (that is, Catholicism and special privileges of corporate groups), but they were defeated in 1861. Conservatives unsuccessfully tried again with the French Intervention (1862–67) to reinstate the dominance of the Church.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

Following the fall of the Second Empire in 1867, liberal presidents Benito Juárez and his successor Sebastián Lerdo de Tejada began implementing the anti-clerical measures of the constitution. Lerdo went further, extending the laws of the Reform to formalize: separation of Church and State; civil marriage as the only valid manner for State recognition; prohibitions of religious corporations to acquire real estate; elimination from legal oaths any religious element, but only a declaration to tell the truth; and the elimination of monastic vows as legally binding.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Mecham|1934|p=454}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further prohibitions on the Church in 1874 included: the exclusion of religion in public institutions; restriction of religious acts to church precincts; banning of religious garb in public except within churches; and prohibition of the ringing of church bells except to summon parishioners.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Mecham|1934|pp=454–455}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Díaz was a political pragmatist and not an ideologue, likely seeing that the religious question re-opened political discord in Mexico. When he rebelled against Lerdo, Díaz had at least the tacit and perhaps even the explicit support of the Church.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Mecham|1934|p=456}}&lt;/ref&gt; When he came to power in 1877, Díaz left the anti-clerical laws in place, but no longer enforced them as state policy, leaving that to individual Mexican states. This led to the re-emergence of the Church in many areas, but in others a less full role. The Church flouted the Reform prohibitions against wearing clerical garb, there were open-air processions and Masses, and religious orders existed.&lt;ref name="Mecham_457"&gt;{{harvp|Mecham|1934|p=457}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Church also recovered its property, sometimes through intermediaries, and tithes were again collected.&lt;ref name="Mecham_457"/&gt; The Church regained its role in education, with the complicity of the Díaz regime which did not put money into public education. The Church also regained its role in running charitable institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Mecham|1934|pp=457–459}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite an increasingly visible role of the Catholic Church during the Porfiriato, the Vatican was unsuccessful in getting the reinstatement of a formal relationship between the papacy and Mexico, and the constitutional limitations of the Church as an institution remained the law of the land.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Mecham|1934|p=459}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Díaz's personal life, it is clear that religion still mattered and that fierce anti-clericalism could have a high price. In 1870, his brother Félix, a fellow liberal, who was then governor of Oaxaca, had rigorously applied the anti-clerical laws of the Reform. In the rebellious and supposedly idolatrous town of Juchitán in Tehuantepec, Félix Díaz had "roped the image of the patron saint of Juchitán … to his horse and dragged it away, returning the saint days later with its feet cut off".&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{harvp|Krauze|1997|p=226}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Félix Díaz had to flee Oaxaca City in 1871 following Porfirio's failed coup against Juárez, Félix ended up in Juchitán, where the villagers killed him, doing to his body even worse than he did to their saint.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Having lost a brother to the fury of religious peasants, Díaz had a cautionary tale about the dangers of enforcing anti-clericalism. Even so, it is clear that Díaz wanted to remain in good standing with the Church. In 1879, when his wife died in childbirth, he wrote a private letter to Church officials renouncing the Laws of the Reform, which allowed his wife to be buried with Catholic rites on sacred ground.&lt;ref&gt;Cited in {{harvp|Krauze|1997|p=227}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Díaz remarried in 1881, to Carmen Romero Rubio, the 17-year-old daughter of one of his advisors, Oaxaca cleric Father Eulogio Gillow gave his blessing. Gillow was later appointed archbishop of Oaxaca. Doña Carmen is credited with bringing Díaz into closer reconciliation with the Church, but Díaz was already inclined in that direction.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{harvp|Krauze|1997|pp=227–228}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This ''modus vivendi'' between Díaz and the Church had pragmatic and positive consequences. Díaz did not publicly renounce liberal anti-clericalism, meaning that the Constitution of 1857 remained in place, but neither did he enforce its anti-clerical measures. Conflict could reignite, but it was to the advantage of both Church and the Díaz government for this arrangement to continue. If the Church did counter Díaz, he had the constitutional means to rein in its power. The Church regained considerable economic power, with conservative intermediaries holding lands for it. The Church remained important in education and charitable institutions. Other important symbols of the normalization of religion in late 19th century Mexico included: the return of the Jesuits (expelled by the Bourbon monarchy in 1767); the crowning of the Virgin of Guadalupe as "Queen of Mexico"; and the support of Mexican bishops for Díaz's work as peacemaker.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; Not surprisingly, when the Mexican Revolution broke out in 1910, the Catholic Church was a staunch supporter of Díaz.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Mecham|1934|p=460}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Economic development under Díaz ==
Crow states, "It was the golden age of Mexican economics, 3.2 dollars per peso. Mexico was compared economically to economic powers of the time such as France, Great Britain, and Germany. For some Mexicans, there was no money and the doors were thrown open to those who had."&lt;ref name="crow"&gt;{{harvp|Crow|1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, economic progress varied drastically from region to region. The north was defined by mining and ranching while the central valley became the home of large-scale farms for wheat and grain and large industrial centers.&lt;ref name="skidmore" /&gt;

One component of economic growth involved stimulating foreign investment in the Mexican mining sector. Through tax waivers and other incentives, investment and growth were effectively realized. The desolate region of [[Baja California Sur]] benefited from the establishment of an economic zone with the founding of the town of [[Santa Rosalía, Baja California Sur|Santa Rosalía]] and the commercial development of the [[El Boleo|El Boleo copper mine]]. This came about when Díaz granted a French mining company a 70-year tax waiver in return for its substantial investment in the project. In a similar fashion, the city of [[Guanajuato City|Guanajuato]] realized substantial foreign investment in local silver mining ventures. The city subsequently experienced a period of prosperity, symbolized by the construction of numerous landmark buildings, most notably, the magnificent Juárez Theatre.

Because Díaz had created such an effective centralized government, he was able to concentrate decision-making and maintain control over the economic instability.&lt;ref name="skidmore" /&gt; This instability arose largely as a result of the dispossession of hundreds of thousands of peasants of their land. Communal indigenous landholdings were privatized, subdivided, and sold. The Porfiriato thus generated a stark contrast between rapid economic growth and sudden, severe impoverishment of the rural masses, a situation that was to explode in the Mexican revolution of 1910.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Eakin|2007|p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Collapse of the regime ==
[[File:Creelman04.jpg|thumb|upright|Díaz – Creelman interview, Pearson's Magazine, 1908.]]

On 17 February 1909, in an interview with the U.S. journalist [[James Creelman]] of ''[[Pearson's Magazine]]'', Díaz stated that Mexico was ready for democracy and elections and that he would retire and allow other candidates to compete for the presidency.&lt;ref name="brit" /&gt; Without hesitation, several opposition and pro-government groups united to find suitable candidates who would represent them in the upcoming presidential elections. Many liberals formed clubs supporting the governor of [[Nuevo León]], [[Bernardo Reyes]], as a candidate for the presidency. Despite the fact that Reyes never formally announced his candidacy, Díaz continued to perceive him as a threat and sent him on a mission to Europe, so that he was not in the country for the elections.

In 1909, Díaz and [[William Howard Taft|William Taft]], the then president of the United States, planned a summit in El Paso, Texas, and Ciudad Juárez, Chihuahua, Mexico, a historic first meeting between a U.S. president and a Mexican president and also the first time an American president would cross the border into Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Harris|Sadler|2009|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Díaz requested the meeting to show U.S. support for his planned seventh run as president, and Taft agreed in order to protect the several billion dollars of American capital then invested in Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Harris|Sadler|2009|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; After nearly 30 years with Díaz in power, U.S. businesses controlled "nearly 90 percent of Mexico's mineral resources, its national railroad, its oil industry and, increasingly, its land."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Zeit |first=Joshua |date=February 4, 2017 |title=The Last Time the U.S. Invaded Mexico |url=http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/02/the-last-time-the-us-invaded-mexico-214738 |magazine=Politico Magazine |location=Washington, D.C. |publisher=[[Politico]] |access-date=February 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both sides agreed that the disputed [[Chamizal dispute|Chamizal strip]] connecting El Paso to Ciudad Juárez would be considered neutral territory with no flags present during the summit, but the meeting focused attention on this territory and resulted in assassination threats and other serious security concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Harris|Sadler|2009|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Texas Ranger Division|Texas Rangers]], 4,000 U.S. and Mexican troops, U.S. Secret Service agents, FBI agents and U.S. marshals were all called in to provide security.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Harris|Sadler|2009|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; An additional 250 private security detail led by [[Frederick Russell Burnham]], the celebrated scout, were hired by [[John Hays Hammond]], a close friend of Taft from Yale and a former candidate for U.S. Vice-President in 1908 who, along with his business partner Burnham, held considerable mining interests in Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Hampton|1910}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|van Wyk|2003|pp=440–446}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | date = October 16, 1909 | title = Mr. Taft's Peril; Reported Plot to Kill Two Presidents | newspaper= Daily Mail | location = London | issn = 0307-7578}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 16, the day of the summit, Burnham and Private C.R.

According to Crow, "A cautious but new breath entered the prostrate Mexican underground. Dark undercurrents rose to the top."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Crow|1992|p=673}}&lt;/ref&gt; As groups began to settle on their presidential candidate, Díaz decided that he was not going to retire but rather allow [[Francisco Madero]], an aristocratic but democratically leaning reformer, to run against him. Although Madero, a landowner, was very similar to Díaz in his ideology, he hoped for other elites in Mexico to rule alongside the president. Ultimately, however, Díaz did not approve of Madero and had him jailed during the election in 1910. 

[[File:Porforio Diaz.jpg|thumb|left|Porfirio Díaz and his wife [[Carmen Romero Rubio]] with other members of the Porfirian ruling faction]]

Despite this, the election went ahead. Madero had gathered much popular support, but when the government announced the official results, Díaz was proclaimed to have been re-elected almost unanimously, with Madero gathering only a minuscule number of votes. This case of massive electoral fraud aroused widespread anger throughout the Mexican citizenry.&lt;ref name="brit" /&gt; Madero called for revolt against Díaz, and the [[Mexican Revolution]] began. Díaz was forced from office and fled the country for Spain on May 31, 1911.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Gen.

On 2 July 1915, Díaz died in exile in [[Paris]]. He is buried there in the [[Montparnasse Cemetery|Cimetière du Montparnasse]]. He was survived by his second wife (María del Carmen Romero-Rubio Castelló, 1864–1944) and two of his children (Deodato Lucas Porfirio Díaz Ortega, 1873–1946, and Luz Aurora Victoria Díaz Ortega, 1875–1965). His other five children died as infants. His widow was allowed to return to Mexico in the 1940s under the presidency of [[Manuel Ávila Camacho]].&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{harvp|Garner|2001|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1938, the 430-piece collection of arms of the late General Porfirio Díaz was donated to the [[Royal Military College of Canada]] in [[Kingston, Ontario]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rmcc.forces.gc.ca/cam/mus/collecti-eng.php|title=Collections &amp; History Gallery|first=|last=webmaster.rmc|date=23 March 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legacy ==
[[File:Centenario.jpg|thumb|Celebration of Mexico's first one hundred years of Independence in 1910, Porfirio Díaz (left) and [[Enrique Creel]] (center)]]

The legacy of Díaz has undergone revision since the 1990s. In Díaz's lifetime before his ouster, there was an adulatory literature, which has been named "Porfirismo". The vast literature that characterizes him as a ruthless tyrant and dictator has its origins in the late period of Díaz's rule and has continued to shape Díaz's historical image. In recent years, however, Díaz's legacy has been re-evaluated by Mexican historians, most prominently by [[Enrique Krauze]], in what has been termed "Neo-Porfirismo".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Garner|2001|pp=1–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Krauze|1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Krauze|1997|loc=Chapter 9, "The Triumph of the Mestizo", pp. 205–244}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Mexico pursued a [[neoliberal]] path under President [[Carlos Salinas de Gortari]], the modernizing policies of Díaz that opened Mexico up to foreign investment fit with the new pragmatism of the Institutional Revolutionary Party. Díaz was characterized as a far more benign figure for these revisionists.

With the wave of anti-Americanism in 2003, the following words of Díaz were recalled{{by whom|date=July 2018}}: "Poor Mexico, so far from God, so close to the United States."&lt;ref&gt;Peter H. Merkl, ''The Distracted Eagle: The Rift between America and Old Europe'', (Routeledge, London &amp; New York, 2005), p 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

Partly due to Díaz's lengthy tenure, the [[Constitution of Mexico|current Mexican constitution]] limits a president to a single six-year term with no possibility of re-election, even if it is nonconsecutive. Additionally, no one who holds the post, even on a caretaker basis, is allowed to run or serve again. This provision is so entrenched that it remained in place even after legislators were allowed to run for a second consecutive term.

=== Attempts to return remains to Mexico ===
There have been several attempts to return Díaz's remains to Mexico since the 1920s. The most recent movement started in 2014 in Oaxaca by the ''Comisión Especial de los Festejos del Centenario Luctuoso de Porfirio Díaz Mori'', which is headed by Francisco Jiménez. According to some, the fact that Díaz's remains have not been returned to Mexico "symbolises the failure of the post-Revolutionary state to come to terms with the legacy of the Díaz regime."&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Krauze|1987|p=150}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In popular culture ==
The main Mexican holiday is the Day of Independence, celebrated on September 16. Americans are more familiar with the [[Cinco de Mayo]]. Cinco de Mayo commemorates the date of the [[Battle of Puebla]], in which Díaz participated, when a major victory was won against the French. Under the ''Porfiriato'', the Mexican Consuls in the United States gave Cinco de Mayo more importance than the Day of Independence due to the President's personal involvement in the events. It is still widely celebrated in the United States, although largely due to cultural permeation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27345">{{Sangam literature}}The '''Purananuru''' ([[Tamil language|Tamill]]: புறநானூறு, meaning ''anthology of four hundred stanzas''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ancient Tamil country: its social and economic structure|last=S. Sundararajan|first=|publisher=|year=1991|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a [[Tamil language|Tamil]] poetic work in the [[Eight Anthologies]] (''Ettuthokai''), one of the two divisions of the [[Eighteen Greater Texts]] (''Pathinenmelkanakku'') collection. It is a treatise on kingship: what a king should be, how he should act, how he should treat his subjects and how he should show his generosity.&lt;ref&gt;The Four Hundred Songs of War and Wisdom by George L. Hart and Hank Heifetz p.17&lt;/ref&gt; The Sangam Collection is classified into [[Eighteen Greater Texts]] (''Patinenmelkanakku'') and [[Eighteen Lesser Texts]] (''Pathinenkilkanakku'') and each classification has eighteen collections, as an anthology of [[Tamil literature]], belonging to the [[Sangam period]]. It is dated between 1st century BCE and 5th century CE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Four Hundred Songs of War and Wisdom: An Anthology of Poems from Classical Tamil, The Purananuru |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mVdBeeiYxh4C&amp;pg=PR16 |date=13 August 2013 |publisher=Columbia University Press |isbn=978-0-231-51252-7 |page=16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Purananuru'' is one of the eight books in the secular anthology of [[Sangam literature]].&lt;ref name="encyclo"&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica (India) 2000, p. 334.&lt;/ref&gt;  The secular anthology is entirely unique in [[Indian literature]], which are nearly all religious texts during this era.&lt;ref name="encyclo"/&gt; The ''Purananuru'' contains 400 poems of varying lengths in the ''akaval'' meter. More than 150 poets wrote the poems.&lt;ref&gt;Parmeshwaranand 2001, p. 1151&lt;/ref&gt; It is not known when or who collected these poems into these anthologies.

The ''Purananuru'' is a source of information on the political and social history of prehistoric [[Tamil Nadu]]. There is information on the various rulers who ruled the Tamil country before and during the Sangam era.

==Anthology==
Among the eight Sangam anthologies, ''Purananuru'' and ''Pathitrupathu'' are concerned with life outside family - kings, wars, greatness, generosity, ethics and philosophy.&lt;ref name="Hart"/&gt;  While ''Pathitrupathu'' is limited to the glory of [[Chera Dynasty|Chera]] kings in 108 verses, ''Purananuru'' contains an assortment of themes in three hundred ninety seven poems.&lt;ref name="Hart"/&gt;  Of the original 400 poems, two have been lost, and some poems miss several lines.&lt;ref name="Hart"&gt;Hart 1999, p. xvi&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nature of ''Purananuru''==
There are 400 poems in ''Purananuru'' including the invocation poem. Poems 267 and 268 are lost and some of the poems exist only in fragment.  Of the poets who wrote these poems, there are men and women, kings and paupers. The oldest book of annotations found so far has annotations and commentary on the first 266 poems. The commentator Nachinarkiniyaar, of the eleventh – twelfth century Tamil Nadu, has written a complete commentatry on all the poems.

A majority of poems are
* praise of the king (2-85)&lt;ref name="Hart349"&gt;Hart 1999, p. 349&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rav"&gt;Rav 2003, p. 126&lt;/ref&gt;
* their generosity (315-35)&lt;ref name="Hart349"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rav"/&gt;
* by poets for their patrons (86-173)&lt;ref name="Hart349"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rav"/&gt;
* war poems (283-314)&lt;ref name="Hart349"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rav"/&gt;
* ethical and moral poems (182-95)&lt;ref name="Hart349"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rav"/&gt;
* references to cattle raids (257-9, 262-3)&lt;ref name="Hart349"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rav"/&gt;
* chief drinking toddy before raids (269)&lt;ref name="Hart349"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rav"/&gt;

===Authors===
It is not known exactly how many authors wrote the poems in ''Purananuru''. There are 147 different names found from the colophons. However some of these could denote the same author. For example, Mangudi Kizhaar and Mangudi Maruthanaar could denote the same person. We don't know 
. Some of the authors of the poems, such as [[Kapilar]] and Nakkirar, have also written poems that are part of other anthologies.

Some of the names of the authors, such as Irumpitarthalaiyaar and Kookaikozhiyaar, seem to be nicknames based on words from the poems rather than proper names. This suggests that those who compiled this anthology must have made up these names as the authors' names must have been lost when these poems were collected.

===Subject matter===
As its name suggests, ''Purananuru'' poems deal with the ''puram'' (external or objective) concepts of life such as war, politics, wealth, as well as aspects of everyday living. Some of the poems are in the form of [[elegy|elegies]] in tribute to a fallen hero. These poems exhibit outpourings of affection and emotions.  ''Purananuru'' principally revolves around three themes - the king and his powers over the environment, power of women's purity, namely ''karpu'' (chastity), and the system of caste, which is not too different from the current system prevalent among Tamil society.&lt;ref name="Hartxvii"&gt;Hart 1999, p. xvii&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also a few poems in ''Purananuru'', which are classified as ''attruppatais''. ''Attruppatai'' poems read like travelogues in which poets who were returning with gifts, received from a king, encourage other poets to do the same by describing the glory of the king and his country. This gives an opportunity to the poet, among other topics, to describe in great detail the natural beauty, fertility, and resources of the territory that has to be traversed to reach the palace of the patron.

===Structure===
There seems to be some definite structure to the order of the poems in ''Purananuru''. The poems at the beginning of the book deal with the three major kings [[Chola]], [[Chera dynasty|Chera]] and [[Pandya]] of ancient Tamil Nadu.&lt;ref name="Hartxvii"/&gt; The middle portion is on the lesser kings and the Velir chieftains, who were feudatories of these three major kingdoms, with a short intervening section (poems 182 - 195) of [[didactic]] poems.  The final portion deals with the general scenery of war and the effect of warfare.

===Landscapes===
Just as the ''akam'' (subjective) poems are classified into seven ''thinais'' or [[Sangam landscape|landscapes]] based on the mood of the poem, the Tamil [[Prosody (poetry)|prosodical]] tradition mentioned in the ancient Tamil grammatical treatise ''[[Tolkappiyam]]'' also classifies ''puram'' (objective) poems into seven ''thinais'' based on the subject of the poems. These are ''vetchi,'' when the king provokes war by attacking and stealing the cattle of his enemy; ''vanchi,'' when the king invades the enemy territory; ''uzhingai,'' when the king lays a siege of the enemy's fortress; ''thumbai,'' when the two armies meet on a battlefield; ''vaakai,'' when the king is victorious; ''paataan,'' when the poet praises the king on his victory; and ''kanchi,'' when the poet sings on the fragility of human life.

The ''Purananuru'' does not, however, follow this system.  The colophons accompanying each poem name a total of eleven thinais.  From the subject matter of the poems they accompany, each can be said to represent the following themes:

* ''vetchi'' - the provocation of war through attack and cattle raids
* ''karanthai'' - defending against cattle raids
* ''vanchi'' - invasion of the enemy's territory
* ''kanchi'' - transcience and change, the fragility of human life, against the backdrop of war
* ''uzhingai''- attacking the fort
* ''nochchi'' - defence of the fort or territory
* ''thumpai'' - the frenzy of battle
* ''vaakai'' - victory
* ''paadaan'' - praise of a king's heroism or generosity, asking for gifts
* ''pothuviyal'' - general heroism (mostly philosophical musings and elegies for heroes).
* ''kaikkilai'' - unrequited love
* ''perunthinai'' - unsuitable love

The last two themes are traditionally associated with ''akam'' poetry.  In Purananuru, they occur in the context of the familiar ''puram'' landscape of warfare.  Thus songs 83, 84 and 85 are classified to belong to the ''kaikkilai'' ''thinai'', which denotes unrequited love, and describe a noblewoman's love for King Cholan Poravai Kopperunarkilli.  Similarly, songs 143 to 147 are classified as ''perunthinai'' or ''perunkilai thinai'', which denotes unsuitable love, and deal with King Pekan's abandonment of his wife.  ''Pothuviyal'' is described in commentaries as a general ''thinai'' used for poems that cannot be classified in any other manner but, in the context of ''Purananuru'', is used almost exclusively for didactic verse and elegies or laments for dead heroes.

''[[Tolkappiyam]]'' does not mention several of ''Purananuru's'' poetic meters and grammatical structure, which make it at least as old as Tolkappiyam if not more.  Some of the meters in Purananuru are Archaic.  Also, ''Tolkappiyam's'' ''oozhinai'' theme does not occur in ''Purananuru'', its role being filled to some extent by the ''nochchi'' theme, whilst other themes, described as having a particular function in ''Tolkappiyam,'' are utilised differently by ''Purananuru''.  The ''thinais'' for 44 poems have been lost due to the deterioration of the palm-leaf manuscripts.

The poems are further classified into ''thurais''. A ''thurai'' denotes the ''locale'' of the poem giving the situation under which it was written.  Some of these are ''parisil thurai'' when the poet reminds the king or patron of the reward that he promised to him, ''kalitrutanilai'' in which the hero dies with the elephant he killed in battle, and so on. Some of the poems are too damaged in the manuscripts to determine their ''thurais''. It is not known whether the authors of the poems made these classifications. It is more likely that those who collected the anthology applied these classifications. Poem 289 was not assigned any classification, for reasons unknown.

===Realism===
''Purananuru'' songs exhibit a unique realism and immediacy not frequently found in classical literature. The nature and the subject of the poems lend us to believe that poets did not write these poems on events that happened years prior, rather they wrote (or sang) them on impulse ''in situ''. Some of the poems are conversational in which the poet pleads, begs, chides or praises the king. One such example is poem 46. The poet Kovur Kizhaar address the [[Chola]] king [[Killivalavan]] to save the lives of the children of a defeated enemy who are about to be executed by being trampled under an elephant. The poet says, "… O king, you belong to the heritage of kings who sliced their own flesh to save the life of a pigeon, look at these children; they are so naïve of their plight that they have stopped crying to look at the swinging trunk of the elephant in amusement. Have pity on them…" The almost [[impressionistic]] picture the poem paints cannot be anything but by someone who is witness to the events present in the poem.

The second poem by Mudinagarayar addresses the [[Chera dynasty|Chera]] king Uthayan Cheralaathan and praises him for his feeding the armies at the [[Kurukshetra war]]. This is an obvious anachronism suggesting a king of the early [[common era]] Tamil country had a role to play in a mythological battle of the [[Mahabharata]] epic. Based on this one poem, there have been attempts at dating the ''Purananuru'' poems to around 1000 BCE or older.

==Historical source==
{{See also| Tamil history from Sangam literature}}
Each ''Purananuru'' poem has a colophon attached to it giving the authorship and subject matter of the poem, the name of the king or chieftain to whom the poem relates and the occasion which called forth the eulogy are also found.

It is from these colophons and rarely from the texts of the poems themselves, that we gather the names of many kings and chieftains and the poets and poetesses patronised by them. The task of reducing these names to an ordered scheme in which the different generations of contemporaries can be marked off one another has not been easy. To add to the confusions, some historians have even denounced these colophons as later additions and untrustworthy as historical documents.

A careful study of the synchronisation between the kings, chieftains and the poets suggested by these colophons indicates that this body of literature reflect occurrences within a period of four or five continuous generations at the most, a period of 120 or 150 years. Any attempt at extracting a systematic chronology and data from these poems should be aware of the casual nature of these poems and the wide difference between the purposes of the anthologist who collected these poems and the historian’s attempts are arriving at a continuous history.

There have been unsuccessful attempts at dating the poems of ''Purananuru'' based on the mention of the mythical Mahabharata war. A more reliable source for the period of these poems is based on the mentions one finds on the foreign trade and presence of Greek and Roman merchants in the port of [[Muziris|Musiri]] (poem 343), which give us a date of between 200 BCE to 150 CE for the period of these poems. This is further strengthened by the mention of a reference to [[Ramayana]] in poem 378, and a reference to [[Maurya]] in poem 175, which indicates a late date of about 187 BCE. A combination of these two considerations would indicate a composition date range during the 200 BCE century.

==Publishing in modern times==
[[File:Tamil palm-leaf manuscript of Ciṟupañcamūlam 2.jpg|A palm leaf manuscript with ancient Tamil text|300x200px|thumb]]
[[U. V. Swaminatha Iyer]] (1855-1942 CE) resurrected the first three epics and Sangam literature from the appalling neglect and wanton destruction of centuries.&lt;ref name="Lal"&gt;Lal 2001, pp. 4255-4256&lt;/ref&gt; He reprinted the literature present in the palm leaf form to paper books.&lt;ref&gt;M.S. 1994, p. 194&lt;/ref&gt;  Ramaswami Mudaliar, a Tamil scholar, first gave him the palm leaves of ''Civaka Cintamani'' to study.&lt;ref name="Lal"/&gt;  Being the first time, Swaminatha Iyer had to face many difficulties in terms of interpreting, finding the missing leaves, textual errors and unfamiliar terms.&lt;ref name="Lal"/&gt;  He went on tiring journeys to remote villages in search of the missing manuscripts.  After years of toil, he published ''[[Civaka Cintamani]]'' in book form in 1887 CE, followed by ''[[Silappatikaram]]'' in 1892 CE and ''Purananuru'' in 1894 CE.&lt;ref name="Lal"/&gt;&lt;ref name="zvelebil"&gt;Zvelebil 1992, p. 197&lt;/ref&gt;  Along with the text, he added abundant commentary and explanatory notes of terms, textual variations and approaches to explaining the context.&lt;ref name="Lal"/&gt;

{{Roman Catholic Mariology}}
'''''Redemptoris Mater''''' ([[Latin language|Latin]]: ''Mother of the Redeemer'') is the title of a [[Mariology (Roman Catholic)|Mariological]] [[encyclical]] by [[Pope John Paul II]], delivered on March 25, 1987 in [[Saint Peter's Basilica]] in [[Rome]].

This encyclical is subtitled ''On the Blessed Virgin Mary in the life of the Pilgrim Church'' and deals with a number of issues in [[Mariology (Roman Catholic)|Mariology]]. It is a somewhat detailed encyclical with three main parts, as well as an introductory section and a conclusions section. 

==Contents==
The encyclical starts by discussing the special place of the [[BVM(RC)|Blessed Virgin Mary]] in the plan of salvation and continues to focus on Mary's role in the ''Mystery of Christ'' in Part I of the encyclical.

Part II discusses Mary's role as the ''Mother of God'' at the centre of the Pilgrim Church. This is built on later in Part III where [[Pope John Paul II]] confirmed the title, ''Mother of the Church'', proclaimed by [[Pope Paul VI]] at the [[Second Vatican Council]] on November 21, 1964. This encyclical states:
 
:Mary embraces each and every one in the Church, and embraces each and every one through the Church. In this sense Mary, Mother of the Church, is also the Church's model.

Part III also deals with ''Maternal Mediation'' and the role of the Virgin Mary as a ''[[Mediatrix]]''. The pontiff said:

:Thus there is a mediation: Mary places herself between her Son and mankind in the reality of their wants, needs and sufferings. She puts herself "in the middle," that is to say she acts as a mediatrix not as an outsider, but in her position as mother. She knows that as such she can point out to her Son the needs of mankind, and in fact, she "has the right" to do so. Her mediation is thus in the nature of intercession: Mary "intercedes" for mankind.

==Influences==
This encyclical reflects the influence of Saint [[Louis de Montfort]]'s [[Mariology|Marian]] teachings on [[Pope John Paul II]]. The pontiff singled out Saint Louis (who also inspired the pontiff's motto ''[[Totus Tuus]]'') in this encyclical, saying that:

:I would like to recall, among the many witnesses and teachers of this spirituality, the figure of [[Saint Louis Marie Grignion de Montfort]] who proposes consecration to Christ through the hands of Mary, as an effective means for Christians to live faithfully their baptismal commitments.

The seeds of this encyclical may be traced to the statement by [[Pope John Paul II]] that as a young seminarian he "read and reread many times and with great spiritual profit" a work of [[Saint Louis de Montfort]] and that:&lt;ref&gt;''Behold Your Mother'' by Stephen J. Rossetti 2007 {{ISBN|1-59471-028-7}} page 30&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zeitun-eg.org/jp2.htm Pope Reveals Mary'S Role In His Life]&lt;/ref&gt;

:''"Then I understood that I could not exclude the Lord's Mother from my life without neglecting the will of God-Trinity"''

In the conclusion to the encyclical the pontiff stated: "The Church sees the Blessed Mother of God in the saving mystery of Christ and in her own mystery".

{{Close Relationships}}
'''Relational transgressions''' occur when people violate implicit or explicit [[Interpersonal relationship|relational]] [[Norm (sociology)|rules]].  These transgressions include a wide variety of behaviors.  

Scholars tend to delineate relational transgressions into three categories or approaches.  

The first approach focuses on the aspect of certain behaviors as a violation of relational [[Norm (sociology)|norms]] and rules. 

The second approach focuses on the interpretive consequences of certain behaviors, particularly the degree to which they hurt the victim, imply disregard for the victim, and imply disregard for the relationship.

The third and final approach focuses more specifically on [[behaviors]] that constitute [[infidelity]] (a common form of relational transgression).&lt;ref name="Metts and Cupach, 2007"&gt;Metts and Cupach, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The boundaries of relational transgressions are permeable.  [[Betrayal]] for example, is often used as a synonym for a relational transgression.  In some instances, betrayal can be defined as a rule violation that is traumatic to a relationship, and in other instances as destructive conflict or reference to infidelity.  Common forms of relational transgressions include the following:  having sex with someone else, wanting to or actually dating others, deceiving one's partner about something significant, [[flirting]] with or kissing someone else, keeping secrets from your partner, becoming emotionally involved with someone else, and betraying the partner's confidence.&lt;ref name="Guerrero, Andersen, &amp; Afifi, 2007"&gt;Guerrero, Andersen, &amp; Afifi, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conceptual and operational definitions==

===Rule violations===
Rule violations are events, actions, and behaviors that violate an implicit or explicit relationship norm or rule.  Explicit [[Norm (sociology)|rules]] tend to be relationship specific, such as those prompted by the bad habits of a partner (e.g., excessive drinking or drug abuse), or those that emerge from attempts to manage conflict (e.g., rules that prohibit spending time with a former spouse or talking about a former girlfriend or boyfriend). Implicit rules tend to be those that are accepted as cultural standards for proper relationship conduct (e.g., [[monogamy]] and secrets kept private).  The focus on relational transgressions as rule violations presents an opportunity to examine a wide range of behaviors across a variety of relationship types.  This method facilitates analysis of transgressions from a rules perspective.&lt;ref name="Metts and Cupach, 2007"/&gt;  In a study of college students' relational transgressions, the following nine categories emerged consistently.&lt;ref&gt;Metts and Cupach, 2007, p. 246&lt;/ref&gt;

# Inappropriate interaction: Instances in which a partner performs badly during an interaction, typically a conflict episode.
# Lack of sensitivity: Instances in which a partner exhibits thoughtless, disrespectful, or inconsiderate behavior.  Offender demonstrates a lack of concern or emotional responsiveness when expected and appropriate.
# Extrarelational involvement: Sexual or emotional involvement with persons other than the offended party.  Offender does not confound involvement with deception.
# Relational threat confounded by deception:  Instances in which a partner participates in sexual or emotional involvement with persons other than the offended party and then uses deception to conceal the involvement.
# Disregard for primary relationship: Actions that indicate the transgressor does not privilege the primary relationship; chooses other people or activities over partner or changes plans.
# Abrupt termination: Actions that terminate a relationship with no warning and no explanation.
# Broken promises and rule violations:  Occasions during which a partner fails to keep a promise, changes plans with no warning or explanation, or violates a rule that the offended person assumes was binding.
# Deception, secrets and privacy: Instances in which a partner lied, kept important information a secret, failed to keep sensitive information private, or violated privacy boundaries.
# [[Abuse]]: Verbal or physical threats.
 
Cameron, Ross, and Holmes (2002) identified 10 categories of common relational negative behavior that constitute relational transgressions as rule violations:&lt;ref name="Cameron, Ross, and Holmes, 2002"&gt;Cameron, Ross, and Holmes, 2002, p.310&lt;/ref&gt;
# Broken promises
# Overreaction to the victim's behavior
# Inconsiderate behavior
# Violating the victim's desired level of intimacy
# Neglecting the victim
# Threat of infidelity
# Infidelity
# Verbal aggression toward the victim
# Unwarranted disagreement
# Violent behavior toward the victim

===Infidelity===
{{Main|Infidelity}}
Infidelity is widely recognized as one of the most hurtful relational transgressions.  Around 30% to 40% of dating relationships are marked by at least one incident of sexual infidelity.&lt;ref name="Cameron, Ross, and Holmes, 2002"/&gt; It is typically among the most difficult transgressions to forgive.  There are typically four methods of discovery:   
# Finding out from a third party. 
# Witnessing the infidelity firsthand, such as  walking in on your partner with someone else. 
# Having the partner admit to infidelity after another partner questions. 
# Having the partner tell their partner on their own.
Partners who found out through a third party or by witnessing the infidelity firsthand were the least likely to forgive.  Partners who confessed on their own were the most likely to be forgiven.&lt;ref name="Guerrero, Andersen, &amp; Afifi, 2007"/&gt;

====Sexual vs. emotional infidelity====
[[Infidelity|Sexual infidelity]] refers to sexual activity with someone other than a person's partner.  Sexual infidelity can span a wide range of behavior and thoughts, including: sexual intercourse, heavy petting, passionate kissing, sexual fantasies, and sexual attraction.  It can involve a sustained relationship, a one-night stand, or a prostitute.&lt;ref name="Metts and Cupach, 2007"/&gt;  Most people in the United States openly disapprove of sexual infidelity, but research indicates that infidelity is common.  Men are typically more likely than women to engage in a sexual affair, regardless if they are married or in a dating relationship.

[[Emotional affair|Emotional infidelity]] refers to emotional involvement with another person, which leads one's partner to channel emotional resources to someone else. Emotional infidelity can involve strong feelings of love and intimacy, nonsexual fantasies of falling in love, romantic attraction, or the desire to spend time with another individual.  Emotional infidelity may involve a coworker, Internet partner, face-to-face communication, or a long distance phone call.&lt;ref name="Metts and Cupach, 2007"/&gt;  Emotional infidelity is likely related to dissatisfaction with the communication and social support an individual is receiving in his or her current relationship.&lt;ref name = "Guerrero, Andersen, &amp; Afifi, 2007"/&gt;

Each type of infidelity evokes different responses. Sexual infidelity is more likely to result in  hostile, shocked, repulsed, humiliated, homicidal, or suicidal feelings. Emotional infidelity is more likely to evoke feelings of being undesirable, insecure, depressed, or abandoned. When both types of infidelity are present in a relationship, couples are more likely to break up than when only one type of infidelity is involved.&lt;ref name="Metts and Cupach, 2007"/&gt;

====Gender differences in infidelity====
While [[gender]] is not a reliable predictor of how any individual will react to sexual and [[Emotional affair|emotional infidelity]], there are nonetheless differences in how men and women on average react to sexual and [[Emotional affair|emotional infidelity]].  [[Western world|Culturally Western]] men, relative to culturally Western women, find it more difficult to forgive a partner's sexual infidelity than a partner's emotional infidelity. {{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}   Western men are also more likely to break up in response to a partner's [[Infidelity|sexual infidelity]] than in response to a partner's emotional infidelity. {{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}  Conversely, Western women on average find it more difficult to forgive a partner's emotional infidelity than a partner's sexual infidelity, and are more likely to end a relationship in response to a partner's emotional infidelity. {{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}  A possible explanation for these differences has been proposed by [[evolutionary psychology|evolutionary psychologists]]: over human evolution, a partner's sexual infidelity placed men, but not women, at risk of investing resources in a rival's offspring.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}  Therefore, a partner's sexual infidelity represents a potentially more costly adaptive problem for men than women.  As such, modern men have psychological mechanisms that are acutely sensitive to a partner's sexual infidelity.&lt;ref name="Metts and Cupach, 2007"/&gt;  

Whereas on average Western men are more acutely sensitive to sexual infidelity (supposedly driven by evolutionary requirements noted above), Western women are commonly believed to have greater sensitivity to emotional infidelity.  This response in women is, by the arguments of the theory above, driven by the perception that emotional infidelity suggests a long-term diversion of a partner's commitment, and a potential loss of resources.&lt;ref&gt;Shackelford, Buss, and Bennett, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;  Evolutionary psychology explains this difference by arguing that a woman's loss of male support would result in a diminished chance of survival for both the woman and her offspring.  Consequently, relationship factors that are more associated with commitment and partner investment play a more critical role in the psyche of women in contrast to men.&lt;ref name="Cann and Baucom, 2004"&gt;Cann and Baucom, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

When infidelity involves a former romantic partner, as opposed to a new partner, it is perceived to be more distressing – especially for women.  Both men and women overall view situations of sexual infidelity as more distressing than situations of emotional involvement.  The typical man, however, viewed only the former partner scenario as more distressing with regard to sexual infidelity; men made no distinction for emotional infidelity.  Women, however, view a former partner scenario as the most distressing option for both sexual and emotional infidelity.&lt;ref name="Cann and Baucom, 2004"/&gt; Men and women both judge infidels of the opposite gender as acting more intentionally than their own gender.&lt;ref&gt;Mongeau, Hale, and Alles, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

====Internet infidelity====
Recent research provides support for conceptualizing infidelity on a continuum ranging in severity from superficial/informal behavior to involving or goal-directed behavior.  This perspective accounts for the varying degrees of behavior (e.g., sexual, emotional) on the Internet.  A number of acts not involving direct, one-to-one communication with another person (e.g. posting a personal ad or looking at pornography) can be perceived as forms of infidelity.  Thus, communication with another live person is not necessary for infidelity to occur.   Accordingly, Internet infidelity is defined by Docan-Morgan and Docan (2007) as follows: "An act or actions engaged via the internet by one person with a committed relationship, where such an act occurs outside the primary relationship, and constitutes a breach of trust and/or violation of agreed-upon [[norm (sociology)|norms]] (overt or covert) by one or both individuals in that relationship with regard to relational exclusivity, and is perceived as having a particular degree of severity by one or both partners."&lt;ref&gt;Docan-Morgan and Docan, 2007, p.331&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jealousy===
{{Main|Jealousy}}

====Characteristics of jealousy====
Jealousy is the result of a relational transgression, such as a partner having a sexual or emotional affair.  Jealousy can also be seen as a transgression in its own right, when a partner's suspicions are unfounded.  Thus, jealousy is an important component of relational transgressions.  There are several types of jealousy.  Romantic jealousy occurs when a partner is concerned that a potential rival might interfere with his or her existing romantic relationship.  Sexual jealousy is a specific form of romantic jealousy where an individual worries that a rival is having or wants to have sex with his or her partner.  

Other forms of jealousy include:
*'''Friend jealousy''' – feeling threatened by a partner's relationships with friends.
*'''Family jealousy''' – feeling threatened by a partner's relationships with family members.
*'''Activity jealousy''' – perceiving that a partner's activities, such as work, hobbies, or school, are interfering with one's relationship.
*'''Power jealousy''' – perceiving that one's influence over a partner is being lost to others.
*'''Intimacy jealousy''' – believing that one's partner in engaging in more intimate communication, such as disclosure and advice seeking, with someone else.

Jealousy is different from [[envy]] and rivalry.  Envy occurs when people want something valuable that someone else has.  Rivalry occurs when two people are competing for something that neither person has.&lt;ref name = "Guerrero, Andersen, &amp; Afifi, 2007"/&gt;

====Experiencing romantic jealousy====
Individuals who are experiencing jealous thoughts typically make primary and secondary cognitive appraisals about their particular situation.  Primary appraisals involve general evaluations about the existence and quality of a rival relationship.  Secondary appraisals involve more specific evaluations about the jealous situation, including possible causes of the jealousy and potential outcomes to the situation.  There are four common types of secondary appraisals:  
# Jealous people assess motives. 
# Jealous people compare themselves to their rival. 
# They evaluate their potential alternatives. 
# Finally, jealous people assess their potential loss.&lt;ref name = "Guerrero, Andersen, &amp; Afifi, 2007"/&gt;

Jealous individuals make appraisals to develop coping strategies and assess potential outcomes.

Jealous individuals normally experience combinations of emotions, in addition to the aforementioned cognitive appraisals.  The most common emotions associated with jealousy are fear and anger; people are fearful of losing their relationship and they are often angry at their partner or rival.  Other common negative emotions associated with jealousy are sadness, guilt, hurt, and envy.  Sometimes, however, jealousy leads to positive emotions, including increased passion, love, and appreciation. 

Relational partners sometimes intentionally induce jealousy in their relationship.&lt;ref name = "Guerrero, Andersen, &amp; Afifi, 2007"/&gt;  There are typically two types of goals for jealousy induction.  Relational rewards reflect the desire to improve the relationship, increase self-esteem, and increase relational rewards.  The second type of goal, relational revenge, reflects the desire to punish one's partner, the need for revenge, and the desire to control one's partner.  The tactic of inducing jealousy may produce unintended consequences, as jealousy often leads to other relational transgressions including violence.&lt;ref&gt;Fleischmann, Spitzberg, Andersen, and Roesch, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

====Communicative responses to jealousy====
Jealousy can involve a wide range of communicative responses.  These responses are based upon the individuals' goals and emotions.  The most common of these responses are negative affect expression, [[Integrative communication theory|integrative communication]], and distributive communication.  When people want to maintain their relationship, they use integrative communication and compensatory restoration.  People who are fearful of losing their relationships typically use compensatory restoration.  

Conversely, people who are concerned with maintaining their self-esteem allege that they deny jealous feelings.  When individuals are motivated to [[Uncertainty Reduction Theory|reduce uncertainty]] about their partner, they use integrative communication, surveillance, and rival contacts to seek additional information.  Communicative responses to jealousy may help reduce uncertainty and restore self-esteem, but they may actually increase uncertainty and negatively impact relationships and self-esteem in some instances. The type of communicative response used is critical.  

For example, avoidance/denial may be used to protect one's self-esteem, but it may also result in increased uncertainty and relational dissatisfaction, if the jealous partner is left with lingering suspicions.  Similarly, compensatory restoration may improve the relationship in some instances, but it may also communicate low self-esteem and desperation by the jealous individual.&lt;ref&gt;Guerrero, Andersen, Jorgensen, Spitzberg, and Eloy, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;  Distributive communication, which includes behaviors such as yelling and confrontation, may serve to vent negative emotion and retaliate by making the partner feel bad.  This may exacerbate an already negative situation and make reconciliation less likely.&lt;ref&gt;Bachman and Guerrero, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

====Jealousy and relational satisfaction====
Jealousy is generally considered to be a relationship dysfunction, though it may have some positive relational properties.  These positive properties can be attained through development of one's ability to manage jealousy in a productive way, so that the jealous individual shows care and concern without seeming overly fearful, aggressive, or possessive.  Negative affect expression can be effective if used in conjunction with integrative communication.  Compensatory restoration can be effective, but when used in excess, too much can make an individual seem desperate and too eager to please, which can have detrimental effects on the relationships.&lt;ref name = "Guerrero, Andersen, &amp; Afifi, 2007"/&gt;

====Rumination====
{{Main|Rumination (psychology)}}
From the aspect of jealousy, rumination reflects uncomfortable mulling about the security of a relationship.  Rumination refers to thoughts that are conscious, recurring, and not demanded by the individual's current environment.  Ruminative thoughts occur repetitively and are difficult to eliminate.  In the context of relational threats, rumination can be described as obsessive worry about the security of the current relationship.  Individuals who ruminate are very likely to respond to jealousy differently from individuals who do not ruminate.  Rumination is positively associated with several communicative responses to jealousy (e.g. compensatory restoration, negative affect expression, showing signs of possession, and derogation of competitors) that attempt to strengthen a relationship.  Rumination is also associated with responses that are counterproductive.  Despite efforts to restore relational intimacy, rumination sustains uncertainty, which thereby forms a cycle where rumination is sustained.  Rumination intensifies over time and serves as a constant reminder to the threat to the relationship, resulting in increased negative affect.  This negative affect is associated with destructive responses to jealousy including violent communication and violence towards objects.  Finally, jealous rumination is associated with relational distress and counterproductive responses to jealousy.&lt;ref&gt;Carson and Cupach, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sex differences in jealous emotions and communication====
Women generally experience more hurt, sadness, anxiety, and confusion than men, perhaps because they often [[blame]] themselves for the jealous situation.  Conversely, men have been found to deny jealous feelings and focus on increasing their self-esteem.  Generally speaking, women tend to be more focused on the relationship, while men tend to be more focused on individual concerns.  In communicative responses, women tend to use integrative communication, express negative affect, enhance their appearance, and use counterjealousy induction more often than jealous men.  Jealous men more often contact the rival, restrict the partner's access to potential rivals, and give gifts and spend money on the partner.  Jealous men also engage in dangerous behaviors, such as getting drunk and engaging in promiscuous sex with others.  Analysis from an evolutionary perspective would suggest that men focus on competing for mates and displaying resources (e.g., material goods to suggest financial security), while women focus on creating and enhancing social bonds and showcasing their beauty.&lt;ref name = "Guerrero, Andersen, &amp; Afifi, 2007"/&gt;

===Deception===
{{Main|Interpersonal deception theory|Deception}}
Deception is a major relational transgression that often leads to feelings of betrayal and distrust between relational partners.  Deception violates relational [[Norm (sociology)|rules]] and is considered to be a negative violation of expectations.  Most people expect friends, relational partners, and even strangers to be truthful most of the time.  If people expected most conversations to be untruthful, talking and communicating with others would simply be unproductive and too difficult.  On a given day, it is likely that most human beings will either deceive or be deceived by another person.  A significant amount of deception occurs between romantic and relational partners.&lt;ref name = "Guerrero, Andersen, &amp; Afifi, 2007"/&gt;

====Types====
Deception includes several types of communications or omissions that serve to distort or omit the complete truth.  Deception itself is intentionally managing verbal and/or nonverbal messages so that the message receiver will believe in a way that the message sender knows is false.  Intent is critical with regard to deception.  Intent differentiates between deception and an honest mistake.  The [[Interpersonal deception theory|Interpersonal Deception Theory]] explores the interrelation between 
communicative context and sender and receiver cognitions and behaviors in deceptive exchanges.  

Five primary forms of deception consist of the following:
* '''[[Lie]]s''': Making up information or giving information that is the opposite or very different from the truth.
* '''[[Equivocations]]''': Making an indirect, ambiguous, or contradictory statement.
* '''[[Lie#Lying_by_omission|Concealments]]''': Omitting information that is important or relevant to the given context, or engaging in behavior that helps hide relevant information.
* '''[[Exaggeration]]''': Overstatement or stretching the truth to a degree.
* '''[[Minimisation (psychology)|Understatement]]''': Minimization or downplaying aspects of the truth.&lt;ref name="Guerrero, Andersen, &amp; Afifi, 2007"/&gt;

====Motives====
There are three primary motivations for deceptions in close relationships.
*'''Partner-focused motives''': Using deception to avoid hurting the partner, helping the partner to enhance or maintain his or her [[self-esteem]], avoid worrying the partner, and protecting the partner's relationship with a third party.  Partner-motivated deception can sometimes be viewed as socially polite and relationally beneficial.
*'''Self-focused motives''':  Using deception to enhance or protect their [[self-image]], wanting to shield themselves from [[anger]], [[embarrassment]], or [[criticism]]. Self-focused deception is generally perceived as a more serious transgression than partner-focused deception because the deceiver is acting for selfish reasons rather than for the good of the relationship.
*'''Relationship-focused motives''': Using deception to limit relationship harm by avoiding conflict or relational trauma.  Relationally motivated deception can be beneficial to a relationship, and other times it can be harmful by further complicating matters.&lt;ref name="Guerrero, Andersen, &amp; Afifi, 2007"/&gt;

====Detection====
Deception detection between relational partners is extremely difficult, unless a partner tells a blatant or obvious lie or contradicts something the other partner knows to be true.  While it is difficult to deceive a partner over a long period of time, deception often occurs in day-to-day conversations between relational partners.&lt;ref name="Guerrero, Andersen, &amp; Afifi, 2007"/&gt;   Detecting deception is difficult because there are no known completely reliable indicators of deception.  Deception, however, places a significant cognitive load on the deceiver.  He or she must recall previous statements so that his or her story remains consistent and believable.  As a result, deceivers often leak important information both verbally and nonverbally.  

Deception and its detection is a complex, fluid, and cognitive process that is based on the context of the message exchange.  The [[Interpersonal deception theory|Interpersonal Deception Theory]] posits that interpersonal deception is a dynamic, iterative process of mutual influence between a sender, who manipulates information to depart from the truth, and a receiver, who attempts to establish the validity of the message.&lt;ref&gt;Buller &amp; Burgoon, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;  A deceiver's actions are interrelated to the message receiver's actions.  It is during this exchange that the deceiver will reveal verbal and nonverbal information about deceit.&lt;ref&gt;Burgoon &amp; Qin, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  Some research has found that there are some cues that may be correlated with deceptive communication, but scholars frequently disagree about the effectiveness of many of these cues to serve as reliable indicators.  Noted deception scholar Aldert Vrij even states that there is no nonverbal behavior that is uniquely associated with deception.&lt;ref name="Vrij, 2008"&gt;Vrij, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;   As previously stated, a specific behavioral indicator of deception does not exist.  There are, however, some nonverbal behaviors that have been found to be correlated with deception.  Vrij found that examining a "cluster" of these cues was a significantly more reliable indicator of deception than examining a single cue.&lt;ref name="Vrij, 2008"/&gt; 

In terms of perceptions about the significance of deceiving a partner, women and men typically differ in their beliefs about deception.  Women view deception as a much more profound relational transgression than men.  Additionally, women rate lying in general as a less acceptable behavior than men.  Finally, women are much more likely to view any act of lying as significant (regardless of the subject matter) and more likely to report negative emotional reactions to lying.

=====Truth bias=====
The truth bias significantly impairs the ability of relational partners to detect deception.  In terms of deception, a truth bias reflects a tendency to judge more messages as truths than lies, independent of their actual veracity.&lt;ref&gt;Burgoon, Blair, and Strom, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  When judging message veracity, the truth bias contributes to an overestimate of the actual number of truths relative to the base rate of actual truths.  The truth bias is especially strong within close relationships.  People are highly inclined to trust the communications of others and are unlikely to question the relational partner unless faced with a major deviation of behavior that forces a reevaluation.  When attempting to detect deceit from a familiar person or relational partner, a large amount of information about the partner is brought to mind.  This information essentially overwhelms the receiver's cognitive ability to detect and process any cues to deception.  It is somewhat easier to detect deception in strangers, when less information about that person is brought to mind.&lt;ref&gt;Millar and Millar, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hurtful messages===
Messages that convey negative feelings or rejection lead to emotions such as hurt and anger. Hurtful messages are associated with less satisfying relationships.  Intentionally hurtful messages are among the most serious, as perceived by a partner.  Unlike physical pain that usually subsides over time, hurtful messages and hurt feelings often persist for a long period of time and be recalled even years after the event.  The interpersonal damage caused by hurtful messages is sometimes permanent.&lt;ref&gt;Leary, Springer, Negel, Ansell, and Evans, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;  People are more likely to be upset if they believe their relational partner said something to deliberately hurt them.  Some of the most common forms of hurtful messages include evaluations, accusations, and informative statements.&lt;ref name="Guerrero, Andersen, &amp; Afifi, 2007"/&gt;  

Feeling devalued is a central component of hurtful messages.&lt;ref name="Guerrero, Andersen, &amp; Afifi, 2007"/&gt;  Similar to verbally aggressive messages, hurtful messages that are stated intensely may be viewed as particularly detrimental. The cliché "It's not what you say, but how you say it" is very applicable with regard to recipients' appraisals of hurtful messages.&lt;ref&gt;Young, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Females tend to experience more hurt than males in response to hurtful messages.&lt;ref&gt;Fine and Olson, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

==Repairing the damage==

===Conceptualizing forgiveness===
{{Main|Forgiveness}}
Individuals tend to experience a wide array of complex [[emotion]]s following a relational transgression.  These emotions are shown to have utility as an initial coping mechanism.&lt;ref name="Metts, S., &amp; Cupach, W., 2007"&gt;Metts, S., &amp; Cupach, W., 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, fear can result in a protective orientation following a serious transgression;&lt;ref&gt;Izard &amp; Ackerman, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; sadness results in contemplation and reflection &lt;ref&gt;Barr-Zisowitz, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; while disgust causes us to repel from its source.&lt;ref&gt;Rozin, Haidt, &amp; McCauley, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;  However, beyond the initial situation these emotions can be detrimental to one’s mental
and physical state.&lt;ref&gt;Baumeister, Exline, &amp; Sommer, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;  Consequently, forgiveness is viewed as a more productive means of dealing with the transgression along with engaging the one who committed the transgression.&lt;ref name="Metts, S., &amp; Cupach, W., 2007"/&gt;

Forgiving is not the act of excusing or condoning.  Rather, it is the process whereby negative emotions are transformed into positive emotions for the purpose of bringing emotional normalcy to a relationship.  In order to achieve this transformation the offended must forgo retribution and claims for retribution.&lt;ref&gt;Boon &amp; Sulsky, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;  McCullough, Worthington, and Rachal (1997) defined forgiveness as a, “set of motivational changes whereby one becomes (a) decreasingly motivated to retaliate against an offending relationship partner, (b) decreasingly motivated to maintain estrangement from the offender, and (c) increasingly motivated by conciliation and goodwill for the offender, despite the offender’s hurtful actions”.&lt;ref&gt;McCullough, Worthington, and Rachal, 1997, p.323&lt;/ref&gt;  In essence, relational partners choose constructive behaviors that show an emotional commitment and willingness to sacrifice in order to achieve a state of forgiveness.

===Dimensions of forgiveness===
The link between reconciliation and forgiveness involves exploring two dimensions of forgiveness:  intrapsychic and interpersonal.  The '''intrapsychic''' dimension relates to the cognitive processes and interpretations associated with a transgression (i.e. internal state), whereas '''interpersonal''' forgiveness is the interaction between relational partners.  ''Total forgiveness'' is defined as including both the intrapsychic and interpersonal components which brings about a return to the conditions prior to the transgression.&lt;ref&gt;Baumeister et al., 1998&lt;/ref&gt;  To only change one’s internal state is ''silent forgiveness'', and only having interpersonal interaction is considered ''hollow forgiveness''.

However, some scholars contend that these two dimensions (intrapsychic and interpersonal) are independent as the complexities associated with forgiveness involve gradations of both dimensions.&lt;ref&gt;Fincham, 2000; Worthington, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, a partner may not relinquish negative emotions yet choose to remain in the relationship because of other factors (e.g., children, financial concerns, etc.).  Conversely, one may grant forgiveness and release all negative emotions directed toward their partner, and still exit the relationship because trust cannot be restored.  Given this complexity, research has explored whether the transformation of negative emotions to positive emotions eliminates negative affect associated with a given offense.  The conclusions drawn from this research suggest that no correlation exists between forgiveness and unforgiveness.&lt;ref&gt;Witvleit, Ludwig, and Vander Lann, 2001; Wade and Worthington, 2003; Konstam, Holmes, and Levine, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;  Put simply, while forgiveness may be granted for a given transgression, the negative affect may not be reduced a corresponding amount.

===Determinants of forgiveness===
[[Image:Determinants of Forgiveness Graphic.JPG|thumb|upright=2.85|right|alt=Predictors of Forgiveness.|Predictors of forgiveness]] 

McCullough et al. (1998) outlined predictors of forgiveness into four broad categories &lt;ref&gt;McCullough et al., 1998; Metts and Cupach, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;
*Personality traits of both partners
*Relationship quality
*Nature of the transgression
*Social-cognitive variables

While personality variables and characteristics of the relationship are preexisting to the occurrence of forgiveness, nature of the offense and social-cognitive determinants become apparent at the time of the transgression.&lt;ref name="Metts and Cupach, 2007"/&gt;

====Personality traits of both partners====
Forgivingness is defined as one’s general tendency to forgive transgressions.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;  However, this tendency differs from forgiveness which is a response associated with a specific transgression.  Listed below are characteristics of the forgiving personality as described by Emmons (2000).&lt;ref&gt;Emmons, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;
*Does not seek revenge; effectively regulates negative affect
*Strong desire for a relationship free of conflict
*Shows empathy toward offender
*Does not personalize hurt associated with transgression

In terms of personality traits, [[agreeableness]] and [[neuroticism]] (i.e., instability, anxiousness, aggression) show consistency in predicting forgivingness and forgiveness.&lt;ref&gt;Ashton, Paunonen, Helmes, &amp; Jackson, 1998; Berry et al., 2001; Berry, Worthington, O’Connor, Parrott, &amp; Wade, 2005; Exline, Baumeister, Bushman, Campbell, &amp; Finkel, 2004; Hoyt et al., 2005&lt;/ref&gt;  Since forgiveness requires one to discard any desire for revenge, a vengeful personality tends to not offer forgiveness and may continue to harbor feelings of vengeance long after the transgression occurred.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson et al., 2005; McCullough et al., 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

Research has shown that agreeableness is inversely correlated with motivations for revenge and avoidance, as well as positively correlated with benevolence.  As such, one who demonstrates the personality trait of agreeableness is prone to forgiveness as well as has a general disposition of forgivingness. Conversely, neuroticism was positively correlated with avoidance and vengefulness, but negatively correlated with benevolence.  Consequently, a neurotic personality is less apt to forgive or to have a disposition of forgivingness.

Though the personality traits of the offended have a predictive value of forgiveness, the personality of the offender also has an effect on whether forgiveness is offered.  Offenders who show sincerity when seeking forgiveness and are persuasive in downplaying the impact of the transgression will have a positive effect on whether the offended will offer forgiveness.&lt;ref&gt;Hoyt et al., 2005; Wolf-Smith &amp; LaRossa, 1992; Metts and Cupach, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  

[[Narcissistic]] personalities, for example, may be categorized as persuasive transgressors.  This is driven by the narcissist to downplay their transgressions, seeing themselves as perfect and seeking to save face at all costs.&lt;ref&gt;Exline et al, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;  Such a dynamic suggests that personality determinants of forgiveness may involve not only the personality of the offended, but also that of the offender.

====Relationship quality====
The quality of a relationship between offended and offending partners can affect whether forgiveness is both sought and given.  In essence, the more invested one is in a relationship, the more prone they are to minimize the hurt associated with transgressions and seek reconciliation.&lt;ref name="Metts and Cupach, 2007"/&gt;  

McCullough et al. (1998) provides seven reasons behind why those in relationships will seek to forgive:&lt;ref&gt;McCullough et al., 2007&lt;/ref&gt;
# High investment in relationship (e.g., children, joint finances, etc.)
# Views relationship as long term commitment
# Have high degree of common interests
# Is selfless in regard to their partner
# Willingness to take viewpoint of partner (i.e. empathy)
# Assumes motives of partner are in best interest of relationship (e.g., criticism is taken as constructive feedback)
# Willingness to apologize for transgressions

Relationship maintenance activities are a critical component to maintaining high quality relationships.  While being heavily invested tends to lead to forgiveness, one may be in a skewed relationship where the partner who is heavily invested is actually under benefitted.  This leads to an over benefitted partner who is likely to take the relationship for granted and will not be as prone to exhibit relationship repair behaviors.  As such, being mindful of the quality of a relationship will best position partners to address transgressions through a stronger willingness to forgive and seek to normalize the relationship.&lt;ref&gt;Fincham et al., 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

Another relationship factor that affects forgiveness is history of past conflict.  If past conflicts ended badly (i.e., reconciliation/forgiveness was either not achieved or achieved after much conflict), partners will be less prone to seek out or offer forgiveness.&lt;ref&gt;Hoyt et al., 2005&lt;/ref&gt;  As noted earlier, maintaining a balanced relationship (i.e. no partner over/under benefitted) has a positive effect on relationship quality and tendency to forgive.  In that same vein, partners are more likely to offer forgiveness if their partners had recently forgiven them for a transgression.&lt;ref&gt;Metts, Morse et al., 
2001&lt;/ref&gt;  However, if a transgression is repeated resentment begins to build which has an adverse effect on the offended partner’s desire to offer forgiveness.&lt;ref name="Metts and Cupach, 2007"/&gt;

====Nature of the transgression====
The most notable feature of a transgression to have an effect on forgiveness is the seriousness of the offense.&lt;ref name="Metts and Cupach, 2007"/&gt;  Some transgressions are perceived as being so serious that they are considered unforgivable.&lt;ref&gt;Younger et al., 2004&lt;/ref&gt;  To counter the negative affect associated with a severe transgression, the offender may engage in repair strategies to lessen the perceived hurt of the transgression.  The offender’s communication immediately following a transgression has the greatest predictive value on whether forgiveness will be granted.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;  

Consequently, offenders who immediately apologize, take responsibility and show remorse have the greatest chance of obtaining forgiveness from their partner.&lt;ref&gt;McCullough et al., 1998&lt;/ref&gt;  Further, self-disclosure of a transgression yields much greater results than if a partner is informed of the transgression through a third party.&lt;ref name="Metts and Cupach, 2007"/&gt;  By taking responsibility for one’s actions and being forthright through self-disclosure of an offense, partners may actually form closer bonds from the reconciliation associated with a serious transgression.  As noted in the section on personality, repeated transgressions cause these relationship repair strategies to have a more muted effect as resentment begins to build and trust erodes.

==== Social-cognitive variables ====
Attributions of responsibility for a given transgression may have an adverse effect on forgiveness.  Specifically, if a transgression is viewed as intentional or malicious, the offended partner is less likely to feel empathy and forgive.&lt;ref name="Metts and Cupach, 2007"/&gt;  Based on the notion that forgiveness is driven primarily by empathy, the offender must accept responsibility and seek forgiveness immediately following the transgression, as apologies have shown to elicit empathy from the offended partner.&lt;ref name="Metts and Cupach, 2007"/&gt;  The resulting feelings of empathy elicited in the offended partner may cause them to better relate to the guilt and loneliness their partner may feel as a result of the transgression.  In this state of mind, the offended partner is more likely to seek to normalize the relationship through granting forgiveness and restoring closeness with their partner.&lt;ref&gt;McCullough et al, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

===Remedial strategies for the offender===
Prior sections offered definitions of forgiveness along with determinants of forgiveness from the perspective of the partner who has experienced the hurtful transgression.  As noted earlier, swift apologies and utilization of repair strategies by the offender have the greatest likelihood of eliciting empathy from the offended and ultimately receiving forgiveness for the transgression.  The sections below address remedial strategies offenders may use to facilitate a state in which the offended more likely to offer forgiveness and seek to normalize the relationship.

====Apologies/concessions====
Most common of the remedial strategies, an apology is the most straightforward means by which to admit responsibility, express regret, and seek forgiveness.&lt;ref name="Guerrero, Andersen, &amp; Afifi, 2007"/&gt;  Noted earlier, apologies are most effective if provided in a timely manner and involve a self-disclosure.  Apologies occurring after discovery of a transgression by a third party are much less effective.&lt;ref name="Guerrero, Andersen, &amp; Afifi, 2007"/&gt;  Though apologies can range from a simple, “I’m sorry” to more elaborate forms, offenders are most successful when offering more complex apologies to match the seriousness of the transgression.&lt;ref&gt;Darby &amp; Schlenker, 1982, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

====Excuses/justifications====
{{see also|Rationalization (making excuses)}}
Rather than accepting responsibility for a transgression through the form of an apology, a transgressor who explains why they engaged in a behavior is engaging in excuses or justifications.&lt;ref name="Guerrero, Andersen, &amp; Afifi, 2007"/&gt;  While excuses and justifications aim to minimize blame on the transgressor, the two address blame minimization from completely opposite perspectives. Excuses attempt to [[Minimisation (psychology)|minimize]] [[blame]] by focusing on a transgressor’s inability to control their actions (e.g., “How would I have known my exgirlfriend was going to be at the party.”) or displace blame on a third party (e.g., “I went to lunch with my exgirlfriend because I did not want to hurt her feelings.”)&lt;ref name="Guerrero, Andersen, &amp; Afifi, 2007"/&gt;  Conversely, a justification minimizes blame by suggesting that actions surrounding the transgression were justified or that the transgression was not severe.&lt;ref name="Guerrero, Andersen, &amp; Afifi, 2007"/&gt;  For example, a transgressor may justify having lunch with a past romantic interest, suggesting to their current partner that the lunch meeting was of no major consequence (e.g., “We are just friends.”)

====Refusals====
Refusals are where a transgressor claims no blame for the perceived transgression.&lt;ref name="Guerrero, Andersen, &amp; Afifi, 2007"/&gt;  This is a departure from apologies and excuses/justifications which involve varying degrees of blame acceptance.  In the case of a refusal, the transgressor believes that they have not done anything wrong.  Such a situation points out the complexity of relational transgressions.  Perception of both partners must be taken into account when recognizing and addressing transgressions.  For example, Bob and Sally have just started to date, but have not addressed whether they are mutually exclusive.  When Bob finds out that Sally has been on a date with someone else, he confronts Sally.  Sally may engage in refusal of blame because Bob and Sally had not explicitly noted whether they were mutually exclusive.  The problem with these situations is that the transgressor shows no sensitivity to the offended.  As such, the offended is less apt to exhibit empathy which is key towards forgiveness.  As such, research has shown that refusals tend to aggravate situations, rather than serve as a meaningful repair strategy.&lt;ref name ="Mongeau et al., 1994"&gt;Mongeau et al., 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

====Appeasement/positivity====
Appeasement is used to offset hurtful behavior through the transgressor ingratiating themselves in ways such as promising never to commit the hurtful act or being overly kind to their partner.&lt;ref name="Guerrero, Andersen, &amp; Afifi, 2007"/&gt;  Appeasement may elicit greater empathy from the offended, through soothing strategies exhibited by the transgressor (e.g., complimenting, being more attentive, spending greater time together).  However, the danger of appeasement is the risk that the actions of transgressor will be viewed as being artificial.  For example, sending your partner flowers every day resulting from an infidelity you have committed, may be viewed as downplaying the severity of the transgression if the sending of flowers is not coupled with other soothing strategies that cause greater immediacy.

====Avoidance/evasion====
Avoidance involves the transgressor making conscious efforts to ignore the transgression (also referred to as “silence”).&lt;ref name="Guerrero, Andersen, &amp; Afifi, 2007"/&gt;  Avoidance can be effective after an apology is sought and forgiveness is granted (i.e., minimizing discussion around unpleasant subjects once closure has been obtained).  However, total avoidance of a transgression where the hurt of the offended is not recognized and forgiveness is not granted can result in further problems in the future.  As relational transgressions tend to develop the nature of the relationship through drawing of new [[Norm (sociology)|rules]]/boundaries, avoidance of a transgression does not allow for this development.  Not surprisingly, avoidance is ineffective as a repair strategy, particularly for instances in which [[infidelity]] has occurred.&lt;ref name="Mongeau et al., 1994"/&gt;

====Relationship talk====
Relationship talk is a remediation strategy that focuses on discussing the transgression in the context of the relationship.&lt;ref name="Guerrero, Andersen, &amp; Afifi, 2007"/&gt;  Aune et al. (1998) identified two types of relationship talk, relationship invocation and metatalk.&lt;ref&gt;Aune et al., 1998&lt;/ref&gt;  '''Relationship invocation''' involves using the relationship as a backdrop for a discussion of the transgression.  For example, “We are too committed to this relationship to let it fail.”, or “Our relationship is so much better than any of my previous relationships.” '''Metatalk''' involves discussing the effect of the transgression on the relationship.  For example, [[infidelity]] may cause partners to redefine [[Norm (sociology)|rules]] of the relationship and reexamine the expectations of commitment each partner expects from the other.

==Summary and application of concepts==
Relational transgressions are a part of any relationship.  In each instance, partners must weigh the severity of the transgression against how much they value the relationship.  In some cases, trust can be so severely damaged that repair strategies are fruitless.  With each transgression both transgressor and victim assume risks.&lt;ref name="Metts and Cupach, 2007"/&gt;  The transgressor’s efforts at reconciliation may be rejected by the victim, which results in loss of face and potentially an avenue of attack by the victim.  If the victim offers forgiveness, there is risk that the transgressor may view the forgiveness as a personality trait that may prompt future transgressions (e.g., “I’ll be forgiven by my partner just like every other time”).

These risks aside, promptly engaging in repair strategies helps to ensure the relationship recovers from transgressions.  Addressing relational transgressions can be a very painful process.  Utilizing repair strategies can have a transformative effect on the relationship through redefining [[Norm (sociology)|rules]] and boundaries.  An added benefit can be gained through the closeness that can be realized as partners address transgressions.  Engaging in relationship talk such as metatalk prompts broader discussions about what each partner desires from the relationship and aligns expectations.  Such efforts can mitigate the effects of future transgressions, or even minimize the frequency and severity of transgressions.

{{Fuke Zen}}
The {{nihongo|'''''shakuhachi'''''|尺八、しゃくはち|extra={{IPA-ja|ˌʃakʊˈhatʃi|pron}}}} is a [[Japan]]ese longitudinal, [[end-blown flute|end-blown]] [[bamboo]]-[[flute]].

It was originally introduced from China into Japan in the 7th century and underwent a resurgence in the early [[Edo period]]. The oldest shakuhachi in Japan is currently stored in [[Shōsōin|Shōsō-in]], Nara. The shakuhachi is traditionally made of [[bamboo]], but versions now exist in [[Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene|ABS]] and [[hardwood]]s. It was used by the monks of the [[Fuke Zen|Fuke sect]] of [[Zen]] [[Buddhism]] in the practice of {{nihongo|''[[suizen]]''|[[wikt:吹禅|吹禅]]||blowing meditation}}.

The instrument is tuned to the [[Pentatonic scale|minor pentatonic scale]].

==Overview==
&lt;!-- Please keep both "shakuhachi means" and "shaku-hachi means" for Google --&gt;
The name ''shakuhachi'' means "1.8 [[Shaku (unit of measurement)|shaku]]", referring to its size. It is a compound of two words:
#{{nihongo|''[[Shaku (unit)|shaku]]''|[[wiktionary:尺|尺]]|}} is an archaic unit of length equal to 30.3 [[centimeters]] (0.994 English [[foot (length)|foot]]) and subdivided in ten subunits.
#{{nihongo|''hachi''|[[wiktionary:八|八]]|}} means "eight", here eight ''[[cun (unit)|sun]]'', or tenths of a ''shaku''.

Thus, "''shaku-hachi''" means "one shaku eight sun" (54.54 centimeters), the standard length of a shakuhachi. Other shakuhachi vary in length from about 1.3 shaku up to 3.6 shaku.  Although the sizes differ, all are still referred to generically as "''shakuhachi''".

[[File:JapaneseShakuhachiSection.jpg|255x255px|thumb|left|A shakuhachi showing its Kinko school ''utaguchi'' (歌口, blowing edge) and inlay]][[File:Myoan-fingering chart.jpg|thumb|164x164px|[[Myōan-ji|Myoan-ji]] shakuhachi fingering chart and notation|left]]Shakuhachi are usually made from the root end of ''[[Phyllostachys bambusoides|madake]] (真竹)'' (''[[Phyllostachys bambusoides]])'' [[bamboo]] [[culm (botany)|culm]] and are extremely versatile instruments. Professional players can produce virtually any pitch they wish from the instrument, and play a wide repertoire of original [[Zen]] music, ensemble music with [[koto (musical instrument)|koto]], [[biwa]], and [[shamisen]], [[folk music]], [[jazz]], and other modern pieces.

Much of the shakuhachi's subtlety (and player's skill) lies in its rich tone colouring, and the ability for its variation. Different fingerings, [[embouchure]]s and amounts of ''meri/kari'' can produce notes of the same pitch, but with subtle or dramatic differences in the tone colouring. Holes can be covered partially (1/3 covered, 1/2, 2/3, etc.) and pitch varied subtly or substantially by changing the blowing angle. The [[Honkyoku]] (本曲)  pieces rely heavily on this aspect of the instrument to enhance their subtlety and depth.

Unlike a [[recorder (musical instrument)|recorder]], where the player blows into a duct&amp;mdash;a narrow airway over a block which is called a "[[fipple]]"&amp;mdash;and thus has limited pitch control, the shakuhachi player blows as one would blow across the top of an empty bottle (though the shakuhachi has a sharp edge to blow against called ''utaguchi'') and therefore has substantial pitch control. The five finger holes are tuned to a [[pentatonic scale|minor pentatonic scale]] with no half-tones, but using techniques called ''meri'' メリ and ''[[kari (music)|kari]]'' カリ, in which the blowing angle is adjusted to bend the pitch downward and upward, respectively, combined with [[embouchure]] adjustments and fingering techniques the player can bend each pitch as much as a whole tone or more. Pitches may also be lowered by shading (''kazashi'' カザシ) or partially covering finger holes. Since most pitches can be achieved via several different fingering or blowing techniques on the shakuhachi, the [[timbre]] of each possibility is taken into account when composing or playing thus different names are used to write notes of the same pitch which differ in timbre. The shakuhachi has a range of two full octaves (the lower is called ''otsu'' 乙/呂, the upper, ''kan'' 甲) and a partial third octave (''dai-kan'' 大甲) though experienced players can produce notes up to E7 (2637.02Hz) on a 1.8 shakuhachi &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://shakuhachisociety.eu/resources/getting-started/|title=Getting started {{!}} The European Shakuhachi Society|website=shakuhachisociety.eu|language=en-US|access-date=2017-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Shakuhachi: Fundamental Technique Guidance|last=Koga|first=Masayuki|publisher=CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform; 1 edition|year=July 24, 2016|isbn=978-1535460705|location=USA|pages=101, 28}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The various octaves are produced using subtle variations of breath, finger positions and [[embouchure]].

In traditional shakuhachi repertoire instead of [[tonguing]] for [[Articulation (music)|articulation]] like many western wind instruments, hitting holes ''(oshi 押し / osu オス)'' with a very fast movement is used and each note has its corresponding repeat fingerings e.g. for repeating C5 (リ) the 5th hole (D5's tone hole) is used.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

A 1.8 shakuhachi produces D4 (D above Middle C, 293.66&amp;nbsp;Hz) as its fundamental&amp;mdash;the lowest note it produces with all five finger holes covered, and a normal blowing angle. In contrast, a 2.4 shakuhachi has a fundamental of A3 (A below Middle C, 220&amp;nbsp;Hz). As the length increases, the spacing of the finger holes also increases, stretching both fingers and technique. Longer flutes often have offset finger holes, and very long flutes are almost always custom made to suit individual players. Some [[honkyoku]], in particular those of the Nezasaha (Kimpu-ryū) school are intended to be played on these longer flutes.

Due to the skill required, the time involved, and the range of quality in materials to craft bamboo shakuhachi, one can expect to pay from [[United States dollar|US$]]1,000 to US$8,000 for a new or used flute. Because each piece of bamboo is unique, shakuhachi cannot be mass-produced, and craftsmen must spend much time finding the correct shape and length of bamboo, curing it for more or less of a decade in a controlled environment and then start shaping the bore for almost a year using Ji 地 paste — many layers of a mixture including tonoko powder (砥の粉) and seshime and finished with [[urushi]] lacquer — for each individual flute to achieve correct pitch and tonality over all notes. Specimens of extremely high quality, with valuable inlays, or of historical significance can fetch US$20,000 or more. Plastic or [[Polyvinyl chloride|PVC]] shakuhachi have some advantages over their traditional bamboo counterparts: they are lightweight, extremely durable, nearly impervious to heat and cold, and typically cost less than US$100. Shakuhachi made of wood are also available, typically costing less than bamboo but more than synthetic materials. Nearly all players, however, prefer bamboo, citing tonal qualities, aesthetics, and tradition.

==History==
[[File:A begging criminal-J. M. W. Silver.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Sketch of a [[komusō]] (right) playing shakuhachi]]
The Shakuhachi first came to Japan from China during the 7th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Shakuhachi: A Manual for Learning (Includes Practice CD)|last=Yohmei Blasdel|first=Christopher|last2=Kamisango|first2=Yuko|publisher=Printed Matter Press|year=June 1, 2008|isbn=978-1933606156|location=|pages=|https://www.amazon.com/Shakuhachi-Manual-Learning-Practice-CD/dp/1933606150=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.shakuhachi.com/Q-Origins&amp;History.html|title=Origns &amp; History of the Shakuhachi|last=Levenson|first=Monty H.|website=www.shakuhachi.com|access-date=2018-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; It derived from Chinese bamboo-flute. Shakuhachi looks like the Chinese instrument [[Xiao (flute)|Xiao]], but it is quite distinct from it.

During the medieval period, shakuhachi were most notable for their role in the [[Fuke Zen|Fuke sect]] of Zen Buddhist monks, known as ''[[komusō]]'' ("priests of nothingness," or "emptiness monks" 虚無僧), who used the shakuhachi as a spiritual tool. Their songs (called "''[[honkyoku]]''") were paced according to the players' breathing and were considered meditation (''suizen'') as much as music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Keister|first1=Jay|title=The Shakuhachi as a Spiritual Tool: A Japanese Buddhist Instrument in the West|journal=Asian Music|date=2004|volume=35|issue=2|pages=104-105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Travel around Japan was restricted by the [[shogunate]] at this time, but the Fuke sect managed to wrangle an exemption from the Shōgun, since their spiritual practice required them to move from place to place playing the shakuhachi and begging for alms (one famous song reflects this mendicant tradition, "Hi fu mi, hachi gaeshi", "One two three, pass the alms bowl",  一二三鉢返の調). They persuaded the Shōgun to give them "exclusive rights" to play the instrument. In return, some were required to spy for the shogunate, and the Shōgun sent several of his own spies out in the guise of Fuke monks as well. This was made easier by the [[wicker]] [[basket]]s (''tengai'' 天蓋) that the Fuke wore over their heads, a symbol of their detachment from the world.

In response to these developments, several particularly difficult honkyoku pieces, e.g., Distant Call of the Deer (''Shika no tone 鹿の遠音)'', became well known as "tests": if you could play them, you were a real Fuke. If you couldn't, you were probably a spy and might very well be killed if you were in unfriendly territory.

[[File:Himeji Oshiro Matsuri August09 126.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Performer playing shakuhachi in 60th [[Himeji]] oshiro festival, 2009]]

With the [[Meiji Restoration]], beginning in 1868, the shogunate was abolished and so was the [[Fuke Zen|Fuke]] sect, in order to help identify and eliminate the shōgun's holdouts. The very playing of the shakuhachi was officially forbidden for a few years. Non-Fuke folk traditions did not suffer greatly from this, since the tunes could be played just as easily on another pentatonic instrument. However, the honkyoku repertoire was known exclusively to the Fuke sect and transmitted by repetition and practice, and much of it was lost, along with many important documents.

When the [[Meiji government]] did permit the playing of shakuhachi again, it was only as an accompanying instrument to the [[koto (musical instrument)|koto]], [[shamisen]], etc. It was not until later that honkyoku were allowed to be played publicly again as solo pieces.

Shakuhachi has traditionally been played almost exclusively by men in Japan, although this situation is rapidly changing. Many teachers of traditional shakuhachi music indicate that a majority of their students are women. The 2004 Big Apple Shakuhachi Festival in New York City hosted the first-ever concert of international women shakuhachi masters. This Festival was organized and produced by Ronnie Nyogetsu Reishin Seldin, who was the first full-time Shakuhachi master to teach in the Western Hemisphere. Nyogetsu also holds 2 Dai Shihan (Grand Master) Licenses, and has run KiSuiAn, the largest and most active Shakuhachi Dojo outside Japan, since 1975.

The first non-Japanese person to become a shakuhachi master is the American-Australian [[Riley Lee]]. Lee was responsible for the World Shakuhachi Festival being held in [[Sydney]], [[Australia]] over 5–8 July 2008, based at the [[Sydney Conservatorium of Music]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.shakuhachi.com/V-WSF08.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ITM"&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/rn/intothemusic/stories/2008/2358068.htm The Empty Bell - Blowing Zen], ''Into The Music'', [[ABC Radio National]], accessed 24 October 2008&lt;/ref&gt;
Riley Lee played the shakuhachi in Dawn Mantras which was composed by Ross Edwards especially for the Dawn Performance which took place on the sails of the Sydney Opera House at sunrise on 1 January 2000 and televised internationally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rossedwards.com/?page_id=27 |title=Dawn Mantras (1999) |publisher=Ross Edwards |date= |accessdate=2014-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Acoustics==
The shakuhachi creates a harmonic spectrum that contains the [[fundamental frequency]] together with even and odd harmonics and some blowing noise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Yoshikawa|first1=Shigeru|editor1-last=Schneider|editor1-first=Albrecht|title=Studies in Musical Acoustics and Psychoacoustics|date=2017|publisher=Springer|location=Cham|isbn=978-3-319-47292-8|pages=1-47|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-47292-8_1|accessdate=24 May 2018|ref=yoshi|chapter=Japanese Flutes and Their Musical Acoustic Peculiarities|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-47292-8_1|series=R. Bader, M. Leman and R.I. Godoy (Series Eds.): Current Research in Systematic Musicology|volume=Volume 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Five tone holes enable musicians to play the notes D-F-G-A-C-D. Cross (or fork) fingerings, half-covering tone holes, and meri/kari blowing cause pitch sharpening, referred to as intonation anomaly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ando|first1=Yoshinori|title=Input admittance of shakuhachis and their resonance characteristics in the playing state|journal=J.

Even though the geometry of the shakuhachi is relatively simple, the sound radiation of the shakuhachi is rather complicated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|last=Ziemer|first=Tim|title=Sound Radiation Characteristic of a Shakuhachi with different Playing Techniques|date=2014|conference=International Symposium on Musical Acoustics (ISMA)|conference-url=http://www.conforg.fr/isma2014/cdrom/data/author_index/index.html|pages=549-555|format=pdf|access-date=24 May 2018|url=http://www.conforg.fr/isma2014/cdrom/data/articles/000121.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sound radiating from several holes and the natural asymmetry of bamboo create an individual spectrum in each direction. This spectrum depends on frequency and playing technique.

==Notable players==
{{Category see also|Shakuhachi players}}
{{anchor|International Shakuhachi Society}}The '''International Shakuhachi Society''' maintains a directory of notable professional, amateur, and teaching shakuhachi players.&lt;ref name="issplayers"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.komuso.com/people/index.pl | title=People whose speciality is shakuhachi | publisher=The International Shakuhachi Society | accessdate=March 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recordings==
{{listen|filename=Shikanotoone new.ogg|title=''Shika no Tōne''|description=''Honkyoku'' recording|format=[[Ogg]]}}
The primary genres of shakuhachi music are:

* [[honkyoku]] (traditional, solo)
* [[sankyoku]] (ensemble, with koto and shamisen)
* [[shinkyoku]] (new music composed for shakuhachi and koto, commonly post-[[Meiji period|Meiji]] era compositions influenced by western music) &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wsf2018.com/about/shakuhachi-terms|title=Shakuhachi Terms – WSF2018|website=wsf2018.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recordings in each of these categories are available; however, more albums are catalogued in categories outside the traditional realm. As of 2018, shakuhachi players continue releasing records in a variety of traditional and modern styles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.komuso.com/albums/index.pl?genre=9|title=The International Shakuhachi Society|last=Nelson|first=Ronald|website=www.komuso.com|language=EN|access-date=2018-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first shakuhachi recording appeared in the United States in the late 1960s. [[Gorō Yamaguchi]] recorded ''A Bell Ringing in the Empty Sky'' for Nonesuch Explorer Records on LP, an album which received acclaim from ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' at the time of its release.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/20-albums-rolling-stone-loved-in-the-sixties-that-youve-never-heard-27652/goro-yamaguchi-a-bell-ringing-in-the-empty-sky-176552/|title=20 Sixties Albums You've Never Heard|last=Stone|first=Rolling|date=2014-05-22|work=Rolling Stone|access-date=2018-09-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the pieces featured on Yamaguchi's record was "Sokaku Reibo," also called "Tsuru No Sugomori" (Crane's Nesting).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.komuso.com/pieces/pieces.pl?piece=2180|title=The International Shakuhachi Society|last=Nelson|first=Ronald|website=www.komuso.com|language=EN|access-date=2018-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[NASA]] later chose to include this track as part of the [[Voyager Golden Record|Golden Record]] aboard the [[Voyager program|Voyager]] spacecraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/golden-record/whats-on-the-record/music/|title=Voyager - Music on the Golden Record|website=voyager.jpl.nasa.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Shakuhachi in the film industry==
Shakuhachi are often used in modern film scores, for example those by [[James Horner]]. Films in which it is featured prominently include: ''The Karate Kid'' parts [[The Karate Kid, Part II|II]] and [[The Karate Kid, Part III|III]] by [[Bill Conti]], ''[[Legends of the Fall]]'' and ''[[Braveheart]]'' by [[James Horner]], ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]'' and its sequels by [[John Williams]] and [[Don Davis (composer)|Don Davis]], and ''[[The Last Samurai]]'' by [[Hans Zimmer]] and ''[[Memoirs of a Geisha (film)|Memoirs of a Geisha]]'' by [[John Williams]].

Renowned Japanese classical and film-score composer [[Toru Takemitsu]] wrote many pieces for shakuhachi and orchestra, including his well-known ''Celeste'', ''Autumn'' and ''November Steps''.

==Western contemporary music==
The Australian Shakuhachi Master and composer [http://www.bambooheart.com/ Jim Franklyn] has composed an impressive number of works for solo shakuhachi, also including electronics. After an extensive research and consultation with virtuoso [[Yoshikazu Iwamoto]], British composer [[John Palmer (composer)|John Palmer]] has pushed the virtuosity of the instrument to the limit by including a wide range of extended techniques in ''Koan'' (1999, for shakuhachi and ensemble).
In [[Carlo Forlivesi]]'s composition for shakuhachi and guitar ''Ugetsu'' (雨月) "The performance techniques present notable difficulties in a few completely novel situations: an audacious movement of ‘expansion’ of the respective traditions of the two instruments pushed as they are at times to the limits of the possible, the aim being to have the shakuhachi and the guitar playing on the same level and with virtuosity (two instruments that are culturally and acoustically so dissimilar), thus increasing the expressive range, the texture of the dialogue, the harmonic dimension and the tone-colour."&lt;ref&gt;ALM Records ALCD-76&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jazz==
[[Brian Ritchie]] of the [[Violent Femmes]] formed a [[Jazz]] quintet in 2002 called ''The N.Y.C. Shakuhachi Club''. They play [[Avant-garde jazz]] versions of tradition American [[Folk music|Folk]] &amp; [[Blues]] songs with Ritchie's shakuhachi playing as the focal point. In 2004 they released their debut album on [[Weed Records]]. 

===Synthesized shakuhachi===
The ''sound'' of the shakuhachi is also featured from time to time in electronica, pop and rock, especially after being commonly shipped as a "preset" instrument on various synthesizers and keyboards beginning in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;The "[[E-mu Emulator II]] shakuhachi" is number nine in [http://www.synthmania.com/Famous%20Sounds.htm "20 Sounds That Must Die"] by David Battino, ''[[Keyboard Magazine]]'', October 1995&lt;/ref&gt; Here is a list of well-known tracks where the sound of an emulated, or sampled shakuhachi can be heard:

'''Sheng Yen''' (聖嚴; [[Pinyin]]:  Shèngyán, birth name '''Zhang Baokang''', 張保康) (January 22, 1931 &amp;ndash; February 3, 2009) was a Chinese [[Bhikkhu|Buddhist monk]], a religious scholar, and one of the mainstream teachers of [[Chan Buddhism]]. He was a 57th generational [[Dharma transmission|dharma heir]] of [[Linji Yixuan]] in the [[Linji school]] (Japanese: [[Rinzai school|Rinzai]]) and a third-generation dharma heir of [[Hsu Yun]]. In the [[Caodong school|Caodong]] (Japanese: [[Sōtō]]) lineage, Sheng Yen was a 52nd-generation Dharma heir of [[Dongshan Liangjie]] (807-869), and a direct Dharma heir of [[Dongchu]] (1908–1977).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dharmadrumretreat.org/aboutus.php?id=ourfounder |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-02-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120220110952/http://www.dharmadrumretreat.org/aboutus.php?id=ourfounder |archivedate=2012-02-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sheng Yen was the founder of the [[Dharma Drum Mountain]], a Buddhist organization based in [[Taiwan]]. During his time in Taiwan, Sheng Yen was well known as a progressive Buddhist teacher who sought to teach Buddhism in a modern and Western-influenced world. In Taiwan, he was one of four prominent modern Buddhist masters, along with [[Hsing Yun]], [[Cheng Yen]] and [[Wei Chueh]], popularly referred to as the "[[Buddhism in Taiwan|Four Heavenly Kings]]" of Taiwanese Buddhism. In 2000 he was one of the keynote speakers in the Millennium World Peace Summit of Religious and Spiritual Leaders held in the [[United Nations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Biography==
Born as Chang Baokang on January 22, 1931 in [[Nantong]], [[Jiangsu]] near [[Shanghai]] in [[mainland China]], he became a monk at the age of 13.

From 1961 to 1968 he trained in solitary retreat in southern Taiwan at Chao Yuan Monastery. Sheng Yen became a lecturer at Shan Dao Monastery in Taipei and then completed a [[master's degree]] (1971) and [[doctorate]] (1975) in [[Buddhist texts|Buddhist literature]] at [[Rissho University]] in [[Japan]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dharmadrum.org/master/master.aspx?cid=C_00000009 Chronology of Master Sheng Yen, ddm.org.tw] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070325230248/http://www.dharmadrum.org/master/master.aspx?cid=C_00000009 |date=2007-03-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.khamkoo.com/uploads/9/0/0/4/9004485/encyclopedia_of_buddhism.pdf|title=Encyclopedia of Buddhism|last=Irons|first=Edward|publisher=Facts on File|year=2008|isbn=978-0-8160-5459-6|location=|pages=441|access-date=2017-05-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170517061902/http://www.khamkoo.com/uploads/9/0/0/4/9004485/encyclopedia_of_buddhism.pdf|archive-date=2017-05-17|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time Sheng Yen was the only major Buddhist figure in Taiwan to have earned a doctorate from a reputable foreign university.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schak|first=David|last2=Hsiao|first2=Hsin-Huang Michael|date=2005-06-01|year=|title=Taiwan’s Socially Engaged Buddhist Groups|url=https://chinaperspectives.revues.org/2803#tocto2n2|journal=China Perspectives|language=|volume=|issue=59|pages=|issn=1996-4617|via=|access-date=2016-12-31|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161012062338/https://chinaperspectives.revues.org/2803#tocto2n2|archive-date=2016-10-12|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sheng Yen received full transmission in the Caodong tradition in 1975 and the Linji tradition in 1978.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Sheng Yen became abbot of [[Nung Chan]] in Taiwan in 1978 and founder of the Institute of Chung-Hwa Buddhist Culture in [[New York City]] in 1979. In 1985, he founded the Institute of Chung-Hwa Buddhist Studies in [[Taipei]] and the International Cultural and Educational Foundation of [[Dharma Drum Mountain]] in 1989.

Sheng Yen taught in the [[United States]] starting in 1975, and established Chan Meditation Center in Queens, New York, and its retreat center, [[Dharma Drum Retreat Center]] at [[Pine Bush, New York]] in 1997. He also visited many countries in [[Europe]], as well as continuing his teaching in several [[Asia]]n countries, in particular Taiwan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.dharmadrum.org/content/about/about2.aspx?sn=43 |title=Biography of Master Sheng Yen, ddm.org.tw |access-date=2013-03-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120728190509/http://www.dharmadrum.org/content/about/about2.aspx?sn=43 |archive-date=2012-07-28 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sheng Yen gave dharma transmission to several of his lay Western students, such as [[John Crook (ethologist)|John Crook]], who later formed the [[Western Chan Fellowship]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.westernchanfellowship.org/ |title=Western Chan Fellowship |access-date=2016-08-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160813034809/http://www.westernchanfellowship.org/ |archive-date=2016-08-13 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and several other Western disciples such as Simon Child, Max Kalin, and Zarko Andricevic.

Sheng Yen's health was poor in the last couple years of his life, although he still gave lectures in Taiwan.

Officially, according to the Western way of reckoning age, Sheng Yen died at the age of 79.

Hours after his death, tributes from eminent Buddhist monks and Taiwanese politicians and celebrities, including President [[Ma Ying-jeou]], Vice President [[Vincent Siew]], [[Democratic Progressive Party|DPP]] Chairwoman [[Tsai Ing-wen]], kung fu star [[Jet Li]], and actress [[Brigitte Lin]], began to pour into Dharma Drum Mountain monastery. As stipulated in his will, Sheng Yen forbade the use of extravagant funeral services, including the construction of memorials or monuments. Sheng Yen received a simple Buddhist ritual attended by the President and dignitaries, and was buried in the Life Memorial Garden near the monastery. His ashes were divided into five sections, with each section filled by the Abbot, senior disciples, President Ma, Vice President Siew, and other laity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In the Chan lineage of Sheng Yen, a "Dharma heir" receives the dharma transmission based on his or her selfless administrative contributions to Dharma Drum Mountain and practice of Chan.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ddm.org.tw/maze/190/page1.asp {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130604064429/http://www.ddm.org.tw/maze/190/page1.asp |date=2013-06-04 }} 交付傳持佛法的任務&lt;/ref&gt; However, a Dharma heir may not have had [[Kenshō|a personal experience of self-nature]] or [[Buddha-nature]], the nature of [[śūnyatā]], in which case the person would also receive ''yinke'' (Jp. [[Dharma transmission#Inka shōmei|inka shōmei]]), the seal of approval. Among the Dharma heirs, there are only a few who have both Dharma transmission and yinke.

Among Sheng Yen's senior disciples, there are also those who have received yinke but no dharma transmission for various reasons.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ddm.org.tw/maze/190/page1.asp {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130604064429/http://www.ddm.org.tw/maze/190/page1.asp |date=2013-06-04 }} 交付傳持佛法的任務&lt;/ref&gt;

(2008). pg 240: "Sultan Valad does not always display technical control of the meter ofhis verse, but he is a generally competent Persian poet&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Sufi]], and one of the founders of the [[Mevlevi Order|Mawlawiya]] ({{lang-fa|مولویه}}) order.&lt;ref name="EncyclopediaIslami"&gt;Schubert, Gudrun. "Sulṭān Walad , Bahāʾ al-Dīn Muḥammad-i Walad." Encyclopaedia of Islam. Edited by: P. Bearman , Th. Bianquis , C.E. Bosworth , E. van Donzel and W.P. Heinrichs. Brill, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and Impact==
He was given the name of his grandfather Sultan al-Ulama Baha al-Din Walad.   Mawlana Jalal al-Din Rumi sent Sultan Walad and his brother Ala al-Din Muhammad to [[Aleppo]] and [[Damascus]] for the study of religious sciences.  Sultan Walad was deeply trusted by Rumi, and it was him that Rumi sent to seek [[Shams Tabrizi]] after the disappearance of Shams.

Sultan Walad married the daughter of [[Salah al-Din Zarkub]], Fatima Khatun.&lt;ref name="EncyclopediaIslami"/&gt;  He had two daughters by her and one son (Jalal Ali-Din Arif). Sultan Walad at the insistence of his entourage, took up the succession which, at his father's death, he had declined in favour of [[Husam Al-Din]].

With Sultan Walad, the Mawlawiya order starts in the true sense of the word, since he gathered the followers (Murids) of his father around himself and organized the order.  He also erected a mausoleum for his father, which also became the center of his order. He died at the advanced age of nearly ninety years on 10 Radjab 712/12 November 1312 in [[Konya]] and was buried next to his father. For nearly fifty years he had lived in the shadow of his famous father, whose personality had determined the life and work of his son even beyond his death.

==Written Work==
Sultan Walad like his father was prolific and has left a considerable [[Persian Language|Persian]] literary heritage.&lt;ref name="Franklin Lewis 2000. pg 237-40"&gt;Franklin Lewis, Rumi Past and Present, East and West, Oneworld Publications, 2000. pg 237-40&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ibtida Nama (The book of the beginning)===
({{lang-fa|ابتدانامه}})
[[File:Ibtida nama 172.jpg|thumb|A copy of ''Ibtida Nama'' in the [[SS. Cyril and Methodius National Library]] in [[Sofia]], [[Bulgaria]]]]

The first Persian poetic verse book of Sultan Walad, in the style Mathnawi (a type of Persian verse)  is the Ibtidā-nāma (The book of the beginning), also called Walad-nāma (The book of Walad) or Mat̲h̲nawī-yi Waladī.&lt;ref name="Franklin Lewis 2000. pg 237-40"/&gt;   Composed around 1291, it is written in the meter of the Hadiqe of Sanai.  It constitutes an important source for the biographies o Baha al-din (Rumi’s father) and Mawlānā (Rumi) as well as for the early history of the order.  It chronicles the history of the Mawlawwiya order, as well focusing primarily on Rumi.  It also describes the predecessors and successors of Rumi.   One of the students of Rumi, Salah al-Din Zarkub who had a close spiritual relationship with Sultan Walad is also mentioned.  This work provides a first hand account by Rumi’s son who was very close to many of the events described in the book.   Overall, it is a hagiographical book, and promotes an image of Rumi as a miracle-working saint.  It also provides a first hand account of the Mawlawwiya order and the major personages associated with its history, including Baha al-Din, Borhan alDin, Shams, Rumi, Salah al-Din Zarkub, Hosam al-din and finally Sultan Wad.  The work contains over 9000 lines of poetry in Persian.  A first critical edition was produced by the Iranian scholar Jalal al-Din Homai in 1937.  A French translation appeared in 1988 through the efforts of Djamchid Mortazavi and [[Eva de Vitray-Meyerovitch]] as ‘’La Parole secrete: l’enseignement du maitre Soufi Rumi’’.

===Rabab-nama===
({{lang-fa|رباب نامه}})
Rabāb-nāma, a Persian Mathnawai, composed, at the behest of a notable, within five months of the year 700/1301 in the meterr ramal of his father's Mathnawī.  It contains 7745 lines in Persian, 35 in Arabic, 22 in Greek and 157 in Turkish.  A critical edition was prepared by Ali Soltani Gordfaramazi in 1980 and published in Montreal as a collaborative effort between McGill University’s Institute of Islamic Studies and the University of Tehran under the title: ‘’Rabāb-nāma az Sultan Walad, Farzand-e Mowlana Jalal al-Din Mowlavi’’.&lt;ref name="Franklin Lewis 2000. pg 237-40"/&gt;  Sultan Walad composed the Rabāb-nāma between April and August 1301 at the request of certain saint whom Sultan Walad repeatedly praises in the text.  This “man of God” approached Sultan Walad with the suggestion that since had already produced a Mathnawi in the meter of Sanai’s Hadiqe, he should now set to work on a mathwnawi in the same meter as the Mathnawi of his father, Rumi.

Sultan Wlad beings this work in an imitation the song of the reed flute (Persian: Nay) at the beginning of the Mathnawi, but instead has the Rabāb start the opening tale:
“Hear in the cry and wail of the Rabāb
A hundred chapters on the depth of love”

At one point Sultan Walad references his fathers work as being “sent-down”, suggesting he regarded Rumi’s writing as quasi-divinely inspired.

=== Intiha-nama ===
({{lang-fa|انتها نامه}})
The Intihā-nāma  is another Persian Mathnawi.  It was composed for the purposes, and is a kind of summary of the first two mathnawī (Ibtida Nama and Rabab Nama).  It contains about 8300 lines of poetry.&lt;ref name="Franklin Lewis 2000. pg 237-40"/&gt;

===Diwan-i Walad===
({{lang-fa|دیوان ولد}})
The Diwan of Sultan, in Persian contains 9256 Ghazals and Qasida, and 455 quatrains.  Approximately there are 12500 lines.  Sultan Walad describes this as his first literary work, but he continued to add to it until his death.  The Diwan has been published under the title:
"Divan-e Soltan Walad, ed. Said Nafisi (ehran, Rudaki, 1959).

A sample Ghazal:

چون ز عشق رخ او نیست مرا هیچ قرار

آمدم باز که بینم رخ آن خوب عذار

می عشقش چو بنوشید دلم از کف جان

مست گشتم که نداندم سر خود از دستار

بدویدم بدر یار و بگفتم ای ماه

که برون آی ز پرده بنما آن رخسار

بنمود او رخ خود را که بمن بنگر لیک

طمع و طلم زنهار توهش دار و مدار

گفتم ای جان نظری کهن سوی این خسته دلم

که ز بدر رخ تو همچو هلالست نزار

غیر تو هیچ کسی نیست بعالم دیگر

از سر لطف بدان دست سر بنده بخار

گفت بگذار مرا رو غم خود خور یارا

تا نگردی تو هلاک و نشوم من افکار

عاشقان رخ من خونی و رندند و دلیر

تیغ بر روت کشند از سر غیرت ناچار

گفتم ای بت غم عشقت نه چنانست که آن

برود از سر من گر بکشندم بردار

چاره خود نیست مرا از دو یکی کار اکنون

یا بوصلت برسم یا که شوم کشتهء زار

از برای تو اگر کشت شوم باکی نیست

مرگ باشد پی آن شخص که باشد بیمار

فد من گشت خمیده مثل چنگ ز غم

بنوازش نفسی گرنه شد از عشق چو تار

گر بخوانی تو بر خویش مرا وررانی

کز غم عشق تو من هیچ نگردم بیزار

تا منم زنده فغانست نصیبم بجهان

گه کنم شوی بکوی تو گهی در بازار

تاج و تختست ولد را غم عشقت صنما

فخر آرد زغلامیت و ندارد او عار

=== Ma’arif-i Waladi (The Waladi Gnosis)===
({{lang-fa|معارف ولدی}})
Also called al-Asrār al-d̲j̲alāliyya.&lt;ref name="Franklin Lewis 2000. pg 237-40"/&gt; It is a Persian prose work in a style approaching the spoken language and containing accounts of Sulṭān Walad's thoughts and words. The title is an evocation of his grandfather's work by the same title. An uncritical edition appeared as an appendix to an undated Tehran print of Mawlānā's Fīhi mā fīh; a scholarly edition was prepared by Nadjib Mayil-i Hirawi, Ma'arif, Tehran 1367/1988.  A collection of 56 of his sermons and lectures in the book demonstrates that he spoke from the pulpit in a straightforward and enganing manner.  Sultan Walad punctuated his discourses with lines of verse from Persian poets such as Sana’i, Attar and his own father, Rumi.  The Ma’arif has been pubhsed under the title "Ma’aref-e Baha al-Din Muhammad b. Jlal al-Din Muhammad Balkhi, Manshur beh Sultan Walad, edited by Najib Mayer Haravi (Tehran, Mowla, 1988)

===Turkish and Greek poems ===

Besides approximately 38,000 lines of Persian poetry in Sultan Walad’s work, in the Rababb Nama there are 22 lines in Greek and 157 in Turkish.&lt;ref name="Franklin Lewis 2000. pg 237-40"/&gt;  In the Diwan-I Walad, there are 15 Ghazals in Turkish besides the approximately 9200 Ghazals and Qasida in Persian,&lt;ref name="Franklin Lewis 2000. pg 237-40"/&gt; and four Ghazals in Greek. In the Ibitda Nama, there are 27 verses in Greek&lt;ref&gt;Matthias Kappler, Die griechischen Verse aus dem ''İbtidâ-nâme'' von Sultân Veled. In Matthias Kappler, Mark Kirhner &amp; Peter Zieme (eds), ''Trans-Turkic Studies: Festschrift in Honour of Marcel Erdal'', Istanbul, pp. 379–397.&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus Sultan Valad composed approximately 300 verses in Greek and Turkish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opoudjis.net/Play/rumiwalad.html|title= Greek Verses of Rumi &amp; Sultan Walad}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sultan Walad admits to his poor knowledge of Greek and Turkish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Franklin Lewis|title= Rumi Past and Present, East and West|publisher= Oneworld Publications|year= 2000|page=239|quote=Sultan Valad elsewhere admits that he has little knowledge of Turkish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, in his Ebteda-Nama,  Sultan Walad admits twice in Persian after some of the lines in Greek/Turkish:&lt;ref&gt;Masnavi-ye Waladi, Ensha’e Baha’ al-Din b. Mawlana Jalal al-Din Muhammad b. Hussayn-e Balkhi, Manshur beh Mowlavi, ed. Jajal al-Din oma’I (Tehran: Eqbal, 1316/1937)&lt;/ref&gt;

بگذر از گفت ترکی و رومی

که از این اصطلاح محرومی

گوی از پارسی و تازی

که در این دو همی خوش تازی

Translation:

Let go of the languages of Greek (Rumi) and Turkish (Turki)
Because you lack knowledge in these two,
Thus speak in Persian and Arabic,
Since in these two, you recite very well.

And also elsewhere in Ghazal in his Diwan, he writes::
''If I knew Turkish, I would have brought one to a thousand.  But when you listen to Persian, I tell the secrets much better''.&lt;ref&gt;Sultan Walad, ”Mowlavi-ye Digar:Shamel-e Ghazzaliyat, Qasayed, Qete’at, Tarkibat, Ash’ar-eTorki, Ashar-e Arabi, Mosammat, Robbi’yyat” Tehran, Sana’i, 1984. pg 556:
ترکچه اگر بیلیدم بر سروزی بک ایدیدم
طتچه اگر دیلرسز گویم اسرار علا&lt;/ref&gt;

He also says:
''If I had known Turkish, I would have told you, the secrets that God had imparted on Me''.&lt;ref&gt;Mehmed Fuad Koprulu, "Early Mystics in Turkish Literature", Translated by Gary Leiser and Robert Dankoff, Routledge, 2006, pg 253&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Mehmed Fuad Koprulu, the Turkish poems are: ''Written in a very crude and primitive manner and with a very defective and rudimentary versification replete with zihaf (pronouncing long vowels short) and imalā (pronouncing a short vowel long)''.
Also according to Mehmed Fuad Koprulu: ''Sultan Walad’s motivation in writing Turkish poetry, just as it was with composing and reciting Persian poetry, was to raise the religious consciousness of the people of Anatolia, to guide them and instill in them a sense of the greatness of Mawlana'' and ''The fact he occasionally resorted to Turkish derives from his fear that a large majority who did not undesrand Persian, would be deprived of these teaching''.&lt;ref&gt;Mehmed Fuad Koprulu, "Early Mystics in Turkish Literature", Translated by Gary Leiser and Robert Dankoff, Routledge, 2006, pg 206&lt;/ref&gt;

Also the Greek verses gives us one of the earliest specimen of [[Islamic]] poetry in the Greek languages, and some of the earliest extensive attestation of [[Cappadocian Greek]].

== Legacy ==

Sultan Walad was instrumental in laying down the Mawlawiya order and expanding the teaching of his father throughout Anatolia and the rest of the Muslim world.  According to Professor. Annemarie Schimmel:&lt;ref&gt;Annemarie Schimmel, "Mawlana Rumi: yesterday, today, tomorrow" in Amin Banani, Richard G. Hovannisian, Georges Sabagh, Poetry and Mysticism in Islam: The Heritage of Rumi, Columbia University Press, 1994.  pg 16&lt;/ref&gt;{{cquote|I have always wondered what kind of Person Sultan Walad was the obedient son who never contradicted his father (unlike his younger brother, 'Ala al-Din, Shams al-Din's bitter enemy), and who tried to fulfill all of his wishes.  Sultan Walad must have had a very strong personality to be able to carry out his duties and, toward the end of his life, to integrate his experience into the formation of the Mevlevi order.  I know of only one other case in the history of Sufism which attests such a loving, complete surrender of a son to his father.}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11053">'''Superdiversity''', or '''super-diversity''', is a [[social science]] term and concept often said to have been coined by sociologist Steven Vertovec in a 2007 article in ''Ethnic and Racial Studies'',&lt;ref name=Vertovec&gt;{{cite journal|first=Steven|last=Vertovec|title=Super-diversity and its implications|journal=Ethnic and Racial Studies|volume=30|issue=6|pages=1024-1054|year=2007|doi=10.1080/01419870701599465}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mmg.mpg.de/departments/socio-cultural-diversity/research-focus/ |title=Research focus|publisher=Max Planck Institute for the Study of Religious and Ethnic Diversity|date= |accessdate=20 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; but which he first used in a [[BBC]] article in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4266102.stm |title=Opinion: Super-diversity revealed |publisher=BBC News |date= 20 September 2005 |accessdate=22 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition and usage==
The term superdiversity is used to refer to some current levels of population diversity that are significantly higher than before.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/research/activity/superdiversity-institute/about/about-superdiversity.aspx |title=About superdiversity|publisher=University of Birmingham |date= |accessdate=20 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vertovec argues superdiversity in Britain "is distinguished by a dynamic interplay of variables among an increased number of new, small and scattered, multiple-origin, transnationally connected, socio-economically differentiated and legally stratified immigrants who have arrived over the last decade".&lt;ref name=Vertovec/&gt; It denotes increased diversity not only between immigrant and ethnic minority groups, but also within them. It has also been called the "diversification of diversity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Recognise superdiversity in S'pore to overcome stereotyping|url=http://www.todayonline.com/daily-focus/education/recognise-superdiversity-spore-overcome-stereotyping|work=Today|accessdate=22 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vertovec gives the example of [[Somalis in the United Kingdom]], arguing that the Somali community includes British citizens, [[refugees]] and [[asylum seeker]]s, people granted [[exceptional leave to remain]], undocumented migrants, and [[secondary migrants]] from other European states.&lt;ref name=Vertovec/&gt; Parveen Akhtar, a sociologist at the [[University of Bradford]], argues that the UK is no longer characterized by diversity but by superdiversity: "Post-1945 you had large waves of immigration from fewer places in the world, largely from the former colonies. Now, since the 1980s, you’ve got smaller waves of immigration from a wider range of places".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How will 'super diversity' affect the future of British politics|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2014/oct/08/immigration-britains-changing-identity|work=The Guardian|accessdate=22 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to Nasar Meer, "Super-diversity has emerged both as a description of empirical phenomena (the proliferation of diversities) and as a normative claim that increased pluralism (both associated with migration as well as wider changes in our understanding of identity categories) requires social scientists and policy makers to develop approaches to register this".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Key Concepts in Race and Ethnicity|first=Nasar|last=Meer|year=2014|location=London|publisher=Sage|isbn=9780857028686|page=144}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Fran Meissner and Steven Vertovec, writing in 2015, the concept of superdiversity has been the subject of "considerable attention" since Vertovec introduced it in 2005. They note that Vertovec's 2007 article in ''Ethnic and Racial Studies'' is the most [[Citation|cited]] article in the history of the journal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Comparing super-diversity|first1=Fran|last1=Meissner|first2=Steven|last2=Vertovec|journal=Ethnic and Racial Studies|volume=38|issue=4|pages=541–555|year=2015|doi=10.1080/01419870.2015.980295}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept has started to influence the fields of [[sociolinguistics]] and [[linguistic anthropology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mutsaers|first1=Paul|last2=Swanenberg|first2=Jos|title=Super-diversity at the margins? Youth language in North Brabant, The Netherlands|journal=Sociolinguistic Studies|year=2012|volume=6|issue=1|pages=65–89|doi=10.1558/sols.v6i1.65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Some authors are critical of the concept of superdiversity. Sinfree B. Makoni argues that the concept "contains a powerful sense of social romanticism, creating an illusion of equality in a highly asymmetrical world, particularly in contexts characterized by a search for homogenization...I find it disconcerting, to say the least, to have an open celebration of diversity in societies marked by violent xenophobia, such as South Africa".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=A Critique of Language, Languaging and Supervernacular|first=Sinfree B.|last=Makoni|journal=Muitas Vozes|volume=1|issue=2|pages=189-199|year=2012|doi=10.5212/MuitasVozes.v.1i2.0003}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Ana Deumert argues:  “The use of ‘superdiverse’ as a descriptive adjective, is a theoretical cul-de-sac, because the complexities brought about by diversity in the social world ultimately defy numerical measurement” &lt;ref&gt; Deumert, A. (2014) [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/22116958/4/supp/C Digital superdiversity: A commentary. Discourse, Context, and Media,4-5, 116-120].&lt;/ref&gt;
The claims of increased migrations and diversity have been challenged by Czajka and de Haas (2014). They observe that while globally the number of migrants has increased so has the world population so the ''proportion'' of  migrants has actually decreased . In the Americas migration has increased but diversity hasn't. The fact that migrations have centered on a “shrinking pool of prime destination countries”  (many of them small countries in Western Europe) led them to conclude that “the idea that immigration has become more diverse may partly reveal a Eurocentric worldview”&lt;ref&gt;Czajka, M. &amp; de Haas (2014) [http://iussp.org/sites/default/files/event_call_for_papers/The%20Globalization%20of%20Migration_extended%20abstract.pdf The globalization of migration: Has the world become more migratory]? International Migration Review, 48, 2, 283-323.&lt;/ref&gt;
Aneta Pavlenko argues that superdiversity is an exercise in academic branding  which  fails as an academic term:&lt;ref&gt;Pavlenko, A (2016) [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/292157452_Superdiversity_and_why_it_isn't_Reflections_on_terminological_innovations_and_academic_branding Superdiversity and why it isn't: Reflections on terminological innovations and academic branding] &lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|text=The uptake of the slippery slogan is not surprising. The aesthetic appeal of truthiness and the illusion of novelty, contemporaneity and relevance undoubtedly explain some of the attraction yet we cannot ignore the fact that the advent of superdiversity provided scholars of multilingualism with a new means to move up the academic ladder, distinguish their publications, and fund their work.}}

==Researchers and research institutes==
Key researchers working on superdiversity include Vertovec, [[Jan Blommaert]] and Jenny Phillimore. The University of Birmingham established the Institute for Research into Superdiversity in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Elkes |first=Neil |url=http://www.birminghampost.co.uk/news/local-news/superdiversity-represents-real-opportunity-birmingham-4311557 |title=Superdiversity represents real opportunity for Birmingham |work=Birmingham Post |date=14 June 2013|accessdate=20 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Max Planck Institute for the Study of Religious and Ethnic Diversity]] in [[Göttingen]] is also an important centre for superdiversity research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://interlandaston.wordpress.com/2014/11/17/exploring-superdiversity-at-the-max-planck-institute/ |title=Exploring Superdiversity at the Max Planck Institute|website=Interland at Aston University|publisher=Aston University|date=17 November 2014|accessdate=20 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New Zealand's "Superdiversity Stocktake: Impact on Business, Government and on New Zealand" was launched in November 2015&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/73871314/New-Zealand-needs-to-adapt-to-diversity|title=New Zealand needs to adapt to diversity|publisher=Stuff.co.nz|date=10 November 2015|accessdate=16 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sponsored by banks, companies, the [[Human Rights Commission (New Zealand)|Human Rights Commission]], and the [[Ministry of Education (New Zealand)|Ministry of Education]]. A study on "Implications of Superdiversity for NZ’s Electoral Laws and Democracy" was also launched. Both projects were carried out by the Superdiversity Centre for Law, Policy and Business, which describes itself as "a multidisciplinary centre specialising in analysing the law, policy and business implications of New Zealand’s superdiversity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Superdiversity Stocktake to launch|url=http://www.immigration.govt.nz/employers/retain/settlementactionz/sept2015/superdiversitystocktake.htm|publisher=Immigration New Zealand|accessdate=2 November 2015|date=1 October 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160202070431/http://www.immigration.govt.nz/employers/retain/settlementactionz/sept2015/superdiversitystocktake.htm|archivedate=2 February 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Superdiversity Centre for Law, Policy and Business|url=http://www.chenpalmer.com/superdiversity/|publisher=Chen Palmer|accessdate=2 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its patron is Sir [[Anand Satyanand]] and its chair is [[Mai Chen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Key Personnel|url=http://www.chenpalmer.com/superdiversity/key-personnel/|publisher=Chen Palmer|accessdate=2 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{distinguish|Empathy}}
'''Sympathy''' (from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] words ''syn'' "together" and ''pathos'' "feeling" which means "fellow-feeling") is the perception, understanding, and reaction to the distress or need of another [[life form]].&lt;ref name="Decety 2010 886–899"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tear|first=J|author2=Michalska, KJ |title=Neurodevelopmental changes in the circuits underlying empathy and sympathy from childhood to adulthood|journal=Developmental Science|year=2010|volume=13|issue=6|pages=886–899|doi=10.1111/j.1467-7687.2009.00940.x|pmid=20977559 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This empathic concern is driven by a switch in viewpoint, from a personal perspective to the perspective of another group or individual who is in need.

==Etymology==
The words ''[[empathy]]'' and ''sympathy'' are often used interchangeably. Sympathy is a [[feeling]], but the two terms have distinct origins and meanings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lishner|first=D. A.|author2=Batson, C. D. |author3=Huss, E. |title=Tenderness and Sympathy: Distinct Empathic Emotions Elicited by Different Forms of Need|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|year=2011|volume=37|issue=5|pages=614–625|doi=10.1177/0146167211403157}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Merriam-Webster]] defines ''empathy'' as "the action of understanding, being aware of, being sensitive to, and vicariously experiencing the feelings, thoughts, and experience of another of either the past or present without having the feelings, thoughts, and experience fully communicated in an objectively explicit manner".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/empathy|website=Merriam-Webster|title=Definition of empathy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Merriam-Webster defines that sympathy is when you share the feelings of another; empathy is when you understand the feelings of another but do not necessarily share them,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What's the difference between sympathy and empathy?|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/sympathy-empathy-difference|website=Merriam Webster|accessdate=14 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/sympathy|website=Merriam-Webster|title=Definition of sympathy}}&lt;/ref&gt; as ''sympathy'' was defined by 18th century philosophers such as Adam Smith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bloom|first1=Paul|title=Against Empathy|url=http://www.bostonreview.net/forum/paul-bloom-against-empathy|publisher=Boston Review|accessdate=28 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Grammarist.com defines ''sympathy'' as "the feeling that you care about and are sorry about someone else's trouble, grief, misfortune, etc."; "a feeling of support for something"; or "a state in which different people share the same interests, opinions, goals, etc.", but not necessarily the feeling that you share another person's emotions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Empathy vs. sympathy|url=http://grammarist.com/usage/empathy-sympathy/|publisher=Grammarist|accessdate=28 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==

In order to get an experience of sympathy there are specific conditions that need to occur. These include: attention to a subject, believing that a person/group is in a state of need, and the specific characteristics of a given situation. An individual must first give his or her attention to a person/group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dickert|first=S|author2=Slovic, P |title=Attentional mechanisms in the generation of sympathy|journal=Judgment and Decision Making|year=2009|volume=4|issue=4|pages=297–306}}&lt;/ref&gt; Distractions severely limit the ability to produce strong affective responses. Without distractions, people are able to attend to and respond to a variety of emotional subjects and experiences. Attention facilitates the experience of sympathy, and without giving undivided attention to many situations sympathy cannot be experienced.

The need of an individual/group is also considered to elicit sympathy. Varying states of need (such as perceived vulnerability or pain) require unique human reactions, ranging from attention to sympathy. A person with cancer might draw a stronger feeling of sympathy than a person with a cold. The conditions which sympathy is deemed as an appropriate response are organized into individual differences and situational differences.

The ways in which people think about human deservingness, interdependence, and vulnerability motivate sympathy. A person who seems 'deserving' of aid is more likely to be helped.&lt;ref name="Lowenstein 2007 112–126"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lowenstein|first=G.|author2=Small, D. A. |title=The scarecrow and the tin man: The vicissitudes of human sympathy and caring|journal=Review of General Psychology|year=2007|volume=11|issue=2|pages=112–126|doi=10.1037/1089-2680.11.2.112}}&lt;/ref&gt; A belief in human interdependence fuels sympathetic behavior.

Sympathy is also believed to be based on the principle of the powerful helping the vulnerable (young, elderly, sick).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Djiker|first=A. J. M.|title=Perceived vulnerability as a common basis of moral emotions|journal=British Journal of Social Psychology|year=2010|volume=49|pages=415–423|doi=10.1348/014466609x482668}}&lt;/ref&gt; This desire to help the vulnerable has been suggested to stem from the paternalistic nature of humans, in which they seek to protect and aid the children and the weak in their survival. People help others based on maternal/paternal instincts to care for their own children or family when they are in need.

Individual moods, previous experiences, social connections, novelty, salience, and spatial proximity can also influence the experience of sympathy.&lt;ref name="Lowenstein 2007 112–126"/&gt; Individuals experiencing positive mood states and people who have similar life experiences are more likely to produce sympathy.

Spatial proximity, or when a person or group exists close geographically (such as neighbors and citizens of a given country), they will more likely experience sympathy towards each other. Similarly, ''social'' proximity follows the same pattern. Members of certain groups (ex. racial groups) favor people who are also members of groups similar to their own.&lt;ref name="Lowenstein 2007 112–126"/&gt; Social proximity is intimately linked  with in-group and out-group status. In-group status, or a person falling within a certain social group, is also integral to the experience of sympathy. Both of these processes are based on the notion that people within the same group are interconnected and share successes and failures and therefore experience more sympathy towards each other than to out-group members, or social outsiders.

New and emotionally provoking situations also represent an explanation for empathic emotions, such as sympathy. People seem to habituate to events that are similar in content and type and strength of emotion. The first horrific event that is witnessed will elicit a greater sympathetic response compared to the subsequent experiences of the same horrific event.

==Evolutionary origins==
The evolution of sympathy is tied directly into the development of [[social intelligence]]. Social intelligence references a broad range of behaviors, and their associated cognitive skills, such as pair bonding, the creation of social hierarchies, and alliance formation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dautenhahn|first=Kerstin|title=I Could Be You: The Phenomenological Dimension Of Social Understanding|journal=Cybernetics and Systems|date=1 July 1997|volume=28|issue=5|pages=417–453|doi=10.1080/019697297126074}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers theorize that empathic emotions, or those relating to the emotions of others, arose due to reciprocal altruism, mother-child bonding, and the need to accurately estimate the future actions of conspecifics. In other words, empathic emotions were driven by the desire to create relationships that were mutually beneficial and to better understand the emotions of others that could avert danger or stimulate positive outcomes. By working together, there were better results for everyone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=de Vignemont|first=Frederique|author2=Singer, Tania |title=The empathic brain: how, when and why?|journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences|date=1 October 2006|volume=10|issue=10|pages=435–441|doi=10.1016/j.tics.2006.08.008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social order is improved when people are able to provide aid to others when it is a detriment to oneself for the good of the greater society. For example, giving back to the community often leads to personal benefits.
 
The conditions necessary to develop empathic concerns, and later sympathy, begin with the creation of a small group of socially dependent individuals. Second, the individuals in this community must have a relatively long lifespan in order to encounter several opportunities to react with sympathy. Parental care relationships, alliances during conflicts, and the creation of social hierarchies are also associated with the onset of sympathy in human interactions. Sympathetic behavior originally came about during dangerous situations, such as predator sightings, and moments when aid was needed for the sick and/or wounded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Trivers|first=Robert L.|title=The Evolution of Reciprocal Altruism|journal=The Quarterly Review of Biology|year=1971|volume=46|issue=1|pages=35–57|doi=10.1086/406755}}&lt;/ref&gt; The evolution of sympathy as a social catalyst can be seen in both primate species and in human development.

==Communication==
Verbal communication is the clearest medium by which individuals are able to communicate feelings of sympathy. People can express sympathy by addressing the emotions being felt by themselves and others involved and by acknowledging the current environmental conditions for why sympathy would be the appropriate reaction.

Nonverbal communication presents a fascinating study of speech intonation, facial expression, bodily motions and person-to-person physical contacts. Some other forms of nonverbal communication include how far people position themselves in relation to each other, posture and appearance. These forms of expression can convey messages related to emotion as well as opinions, physical states (fatigue), and understanding. Emotional expression is especially linked to the production of emotion-specific facial expressions. These expressions are often the same from culture to culture and are often reproduced by observers, which facilitates the observers' own understanding of the emotion and/or situation.  There are six universal emotions: happiness, sadness, fear, surprise, disgust and anger.

[[File:Portret van een man005.jpg|thumb|right|alt=|Facial expressions can communicate sympathy and other emotions nonverbally.]]

Nonverbal communication cues are often subconscious and difficult to control. Deliberate regulation of emotion and nonverbal expression is often imperfect. Nonverbal gestures and facial expressions are also generally better understood by people observing the gestures, expressions, etc., and not by the person experiencing them first hand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=DePaulo|first=B. M.|title=Nonverbal behavior and self-presentation|journal=Psychological Bulletin|year=1992|volume=111|issue=2|pages=203–243|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.111.2.203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Communicating using physical touch has the unique ability of conveying affective information upon contact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wang|first=R.|author2=Quek, F. |title=Touch &amp; talk: Contextualizing remote touch for affective interaction|journal=Proceedings of the fourth international conference on Tangible, embedded, and embodied interaction|year=2010|pages=13–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;   However, this sensation must be paired with the understanding of the specific context of a given situation. The touch of the hand on the shoulder during a funeral might be the fastest method of conveying sympathy. Patting a person on their back, arms, or head for a few seconds can effectively convey feelings of sympathy between people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hertenstein|first=Matthew J. |author2=Holmes, Rachel |author3=McCullough, Margaret |author4=Keltner, Dacher|title=The communication of emotion via touch.|journal=Emotion|year=2009|volume=9|issue=4|pages=566–573|doi=10.1037/a0016108}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonverbal communication seems to provide a more genuine communication of sympathy, because it is difficult to control nonverbal behavior and expressions. The combination of verbal and nonverbal communication facilitates the acknowledgment and comprehension of sympathy.

==Human behavior==
Although sympathy is a well-known term, the implications of sympathy found in the study of human behavior are often less clear. Decision-making, an integral part of human behavior, involves the weighing of costs with potential outcomes. Research on decision-making has been divided into two mechanisms, often labeled "System 1" and "System 2." These two systems, representing the gut and the head respectively, influence decisions based on context and the individual characteristics of the people involved. Sympathy is an agent working in System 1, a system that uses affective cues to dictate decisions whereas System 2 is based in logic and reason. For example, deciding on where to live based on how the new home feels would be a System 1 decision, whereas deciding on a home based on the property value and personal savings would be a System 2 decision. Sympathy acts in a way that provides a means of understanding another person's experience or situation, good or bad, with a focus on their individual well-being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Clark|first=Arthur J.|title=Empathy and Sympathy: Therapeutic Distinctions in Counseling|journal=Journal of Mental Health Counseling|year=2010|volume=32|issue=2|pages=95–101}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is often easier to make decisions based on emotional information, because all humans have general understanding of emotions. It is this understanding of emotions that allows people to use sympathy to make their decisions.

Sympathy also helps to motivate philanthropic, or aid-giving, behavior (i.e. donations, community service). The choice to donate, and the subsequent decision of how much to give, can be separated into two, different emotion-driven decision making processes. Mood management, or how people act to maintain their moods, influences the initial decision to donate because of selfish concerns (to avoid regret or feel better). However, how a person feels about the deservingness of the recipient determined ''how much'' to donate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dickert|first=Stephan |author2=Sagara, Namika |author3=Slovic, Paul|title=Affective motivations to help others: A two-stage model of donation decisions|journal=Journal of Behavioral Decision Making|date=1 October 2011|volume=24|issue=4|pages=361–376|doi=10.1002/bdm.697}}&lt;/ref&gt; Human sympathy in donation behavior can influence the amount of aid given to people and regions that are in need. Increasing how emotional a description is, presenting individual cases instead of large groups, and using less information and numerical information can positively influence giving behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Small|first=Deborah A. |author2=Loewenstein, George |author3=Slovic, Paul|title=Sympathy and callousness: The impact of deliberative thought on donations to identifiable and statistical victims|journal=Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes|year=2007|volume=102|issue=2|pages=143–153|doi=10.1016/j.obhdp.2006.01.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to its influence on decision-making, sympathy also plays a role in maintaining social order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Irwin|first=K.|author2=Mcgrimmon, T. |author3=Simpson, B. |title=Sympathy and Social Order|journal=Social Psychology Quarterly|date=1 December 2008|volume=71|issue=4|pages=379–397|doi=10.1177/019027250807100406}}&lt;/ref&gt; Judging people's character helps to maintain social order, making sure that those who are in need receive the appropriate care. The notion of interdependence fuels sympathetic behavior; this action is seen as self-satisfying because helping someone who is connected to you through some way (family, social capital) will often result in a personal reward (social, monetary, etc.). Regardless of selflessness or selfishness, sympathy facilitates the cycle of give and take that is necessary for maintaining a functional society.

==Healthcare==
Sympathy can also impact the way doctors, nurses, and other members of society think about and treat people with different diseases and conditions. Sympathetic tendencies within the health field fall disproportionately based on patient characteristics and disease type.&lt;ref name="Etchegary 65–84"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Etchegary|first=Holly|title=Stigma and Genetic Risk: Perceptions of Stigma among Those at Risk for Huntington Disease (HD)∗|journal=Qualitative Research in Psychology|date=7 August 2007|volume=4|issue=1-2|pages=65–84|doi=10.1080/14780880701473417}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One factor that is frequently considered when determining sympathy is controllability, or the degree to which an individual could have avoided contracting the disease or medical condition. People devote less sympathy to individuals who had control during the event when they acquired HIV.&lt;ref name="Norman 1032–1039"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Norman|first=L. R.|author2=Carr, R. |author3=Uche, C. |title=The role of sympathy on avoidance intention toward persons living with HIV/AIDS in Jamaica|journal=AIDS Care|date=1 November 2006|volume=18|issue=8|pages=1032–1039|doi=10.1080/09540120600578409}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Even less sympathy is granted to individuals who have control over the means by which they contracted HIV, such as individuals who engage in prostitution.

Sympathy in health-related decision making is heavily based on disease stigma. Disease stigma can lead to discrimination in the work place and in insurance coverage.&lt;ref name="Etchegary 65–84"/&gt; High levels of stigma are also associated with social hostility. Several factors contribute to the development of negative disease stigmas, including the disease's time course, severity, and the dangers that the disease might pose to others. Sexual orientation of individual patients has also been shown to affect stigma levels in the case of HIV diagnoses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Skelton|first=J. A.|title=How Negative Are Attitudes Toward Persons With SAKIDESL–TLOENUKEMIA PARADIGM AIDS? Examining the AIDS–Leukemia Paradigm|journal=Basic and Applied Social Psychology|year=2006|volume=28|issue=3|pages=251–261|doi=10.1207/s15324834basp2803_4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sympathy is generally associated with low levels of disease stigmatization.

Sympathy is related to increased levels of knowledge regarding HIV and a lower likelihood of avoiding individuals with HIV.&lt;ref name="Norman 1032–1039"/&gt;

==Neuroscience perspectives==
[[File:User-FastFission-brain.gif|thumb|right|alt=A succession of brain scan images|Sympathy is being studied with new technology.]]

Social and emotional stimuli, particularly those related to the well-being of another person, are being more directly studied with advent of technology that can track brain activity (such as [[Electroencephalogram]]s and [[functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging]]). [[Amygdala]] and insula activation occur when a person experiences emotions, such as fear and disgust respectively.&lt;ref name='Decety'&gt;{{cite journal|last=Decety|first=Jean|author2=Michalska, Kalina J. |title=Neurodevelopmental changes in the circuits underlying empathy and sympathy from childhood to adulthood|journal=Developmental Science|date=1 November 2010|volume=13|issue=6|pages=886–899|doi=10.1111/j.1467-7687.2009.00940.x|pmid=20977559}}&lt;/ref&gt; Primary motor regions are also activated during sympathy. This could be caused by humans' reaction to emotional faces, reflecting the expressions on their own faces, which seems to help people better understand the other person's emotion. In addition, researchers have also suggested that the neural mechanisms that are activated when personally experiencing emotions are also activated when viewing another person experiencing the same emotions ([[mirror neurons]]).&lt;ref name="Singer 81–96"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Singer|first=Tania|author2=Lamm, Claus |title=The Social Neuroscience of Empathy|journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences|date=1 March 2009|volume=1156|issue=1|pages=81–96|doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.2009.04418.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pain seems to specifically activate a region known as the cingulate cortex,{{mcn|date=August 2016}} in addition to activation that is mentioned earlier.  The temporal parietal junction, orbitofrontal cortex, and ventral striatum are also thought to play a role in the production of emotion.{{mcn|date=August 2016}}

Generally, empathic emotions (including sympathy), require the activation of top-down and bottom-up activity. Top-down activity refers to cognitive processes that originate from the frontal lobe and require conscious thought whereas bottom-up activity begins from sensation of stimuli in the environment. From the sensory level, people must sense and experience the emotional cues of another. At the same time, indicative of the dual-process theory, top-down responses must be enacted to make sense of the emotional inputs streaming in and apply motive and environmental influence analyses to better understand the situation. Top-down processes often include attention to emotion and emotion regulation.&lt;ref name="Singer 81–96"/&gt;

==Child development==
[[File:Baby yelling.jpg|thumb|right|alt=|A baby will often cry at the sound of another baby's cries.]]

Sympathy is a stepping stone in both social and moral development. It generally arises between 2–3 years old, although some instances of empathic emotion can be seen as early as 18 months. Basic sharing of emotions, a precursor for sympathy, can be seen in infants. For example, babies will often begin to cry when they hear another baby crying nearby.&lt;ref name="Decety 2010 886–899"/&gt; This emphasizes the infant's ability to recognize emotional cues in his or her environment, even if not able to fully comprehend the emotion. Another milestone in child rearing is the development of the ability to mimic facial expressions. Both of these processes act on sensory and perceptual pathways, yet executive functioning for empathic emotions does not begin during these early stages. Decety and Michalska (2010) believe that early affective development and later development of executive functions create a disparity between how children and young adults experience another person's pain. Young children tend to be negatively aroused more often in comparison to the older subjects.&lt;ref name='Decety'/&gt;

Sympathy can lead to, and be the cause of [[prosocial]] and [[altruistic]] behaviour. Altruistic behaviour is when people who experience emotional reactions consistent with the state of another person and feel "other-oriented" (inclined to help other people in need or distressed.)
People are more inclined to help those in need when they cannot easily escape the situation. If leaving is easy, an individual is likely to reduce one's own distress (of sympathy; feeling bad) by avoiding contact with the other(s) in need. Sympathy is still experienced when it is easy to escape the situation, showing that humans are "other oriented" and altruistic.&lt;ref name="Nancy Eisenberg 1989"&gt;Nancy Eisenberg, R. A. (1989). Relation of Sympathy and Personal Distress to Prosocial Behavior: A Multimethod Study. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 55-64.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is important to acknowledge that the use or acceptance of sympathy can be both altruistic and self-satisfying in social situations. Parenting styles (specifically level of affection) can influence the development of sympathy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wispé|first=Lauren|title=The distinction between sympathy and empathy: To call forth a concept, a word is needed.|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date=1 January 1986|volume=50|issue=2|pages=314–321|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.50.2.314}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prosocial and moral development extends into adolescence and early adulthood as humans learn to better assess and interpret the emotions of others. Prosocial behaviours have been observed in children 1–2 years old. Through self-report methods it is difficult to measure emotional responses as they are not as able to report these responses as well as adult.&lt;ref name="Nancy Eisenberg 1989"/&gt; This is representative of an increased efficiency of and ability to engage in internal moral reasoning.

===Theory of mind===
The development of [[theory of mind]], or the ability to view the world from perspectives of other people, is strongly associated with the development of sympathy and other complex emotions.&lt;ref name="Decety 2010 886–899"/&gt; These emotions are complex because they involve more than just one's own emotional states; complex emotions involve the interplay of multiple people's varying and fluctuating thoughts and emotions within given contexts. The ability to experience vicarious emotion, or imagining how another person feels, is integral for empathic concern. Moral development is similarly tied to the understanding of outside perspectives and emotions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Weele|first=Cor|title=Empathy's purity, sympathy's complexities; De Waal, Darwin and Adam Smith|journal=Biology &amp; Philosophy|year=2011|volume=26|issue=4|pages=583–593|doi=10.1007/s10539-011-9248-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moral reasoning has been divided into five categories beginning with a hedonistic self-orientation and ending with an internalized sense of needs of others, including empathic emotions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eisenberg|first=Nancy |author2=Carlo, Gustavo |author3=Murphy, Bridget |author4=Court, Patricia|title=Prosocial Development in Late Adolescence: A Longitudinal Study|journal=Child Development|date=1 August 1995|volume=66|issue=4|pages=1179–1197|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.1995.tb00930.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Innate feature===
A study conducted in Switzerland in 2006 sought to find whether or not sympathy demonstrated by children was solely for personal benefit, or if the emotion was an innate part of development. Parents, teachers, and 1,300 children (aged 6 and 7) were interviewed regarding the child's behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Buchmann, Marlis, Michaela Gummerum, Monika Keller, and Tina Malti. "Child's Moral Motivation, Sympathy, and Prosocial Behaviour." Child Development 80.2 Apr. (2009): 442-60.&lt;/ref&gt; Over the course of one year, questionnaires were filled out regarding the progress and behavior of each youth. Thereafter, an interview was conducted in the spring of 2007. The study concluded that children do develop sympathy and empathy independently of parental guidance. Furthermore, the study found that girls are more sympathetic, prosocial, and morally motivated than boys. [[Prosocial behavior]] has been noted in children as young as 12 months when showing and giving toys to their parents, without promoting or being reinforced by praise. Levels of prosocial behavior increased with sympathy in children with low moral motivation, as it reflects the link between innate abilities and honing them with the guidance of parents and teachers.

'''Thomas Hollis''' (April 14, 1720, [[London]] – January 1, 1774) was an English political philosopher and author.&lt;ref name="BJRL"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt;

==Early life==
Hollis was educated at [[Adams Grammar School]] until the age 10, and then in St. Albans until 15, before learning French, Dutch and accountancy in Amsterdam. After the death of his father in 1735, his guardian was a John Hollister. He was trained in this time in public service by [[John Ward (academic)|John Ward]] of [[Gresham College]], London. He [[took Chambers]] with [[Lincoln's Inn]] from 1740 to 1748, though without ever [[reading law]]. By this time he was a man of considerable wealth having inherited from his father, grandfather and uncle.

==Travel and art==
In 1748–9 Hollis toured Europe with [[Thomas Brand Hollis|Thomas Brand]] (later Brand Hollis) and again during 1750–53, largely on his own, meeting many leading French philosophers and several Italian painters. Back in England he was an active member of the [[Royal Society of Arts]]. He proposed [[Giovanni Battista Piranesi|Piranesi]] for membership of the [[Society of Antiquaries of London|Society of Antiquaries]], gave numerous commissions to [[Cipriani]], and, as one of Canaletto's best friends in England, commissioned six paintings from him. These paintings included [[Old Walton Bridge]] in which Hollis, his heir Thomas Brand and Hollis's manservant were depicted, also the interior of the rotunda at Ranelagh. He was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] in 1757. He was well connected, knowing [[Francis Blackburne (archdeacon)|Francis Blackburne]] and [[Theophilus Lindsey]], [[John Wilkes]], several peers, and the elder [[William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham|William Pitt]]. He was a governor of Guy's and St Thomas's hospitals, and a guardian of the asylum and Magdalen Hospital.

==Writing==
Hollis's main contribution to public service was protecting and advancing English liberty by circulating appropriate books on government. From 1754 he reprinted and distributed literature from the seventeenth-century, including works such as [[John Toland|Toland]]'s ''Life of Milton'', tracts by [[Marchamont Nedham]], [[Henry Neville (writer)|Henry Neville]], and [[Philip Sidney]], and [[John Locke]]'s ''[[Two Treatises of Government]]''. From 1760, he had commissioned the bookseller [[Andrew Millar]] to publish works advocating republican government, including [[John Milton]] (1760), John Toland (1760), [[Algernon Sidney]] (1763), Henry Neville (1763) and John Locke (1764). The books were elegantly bound to give them greater effect and tooled with libertarian ornaments such as the liberty cap and owl.&lt;ref name="BJRL"/&gt; He also published writings by American colonists on the Stamp Act crisis, including [[John Adams]]'s ''Dissertation on the Canon and the Feudal Law ''(1765).

To start with the tracts were directed towards libraries throughout Britain and continental Europe; later he turned his generosity to America.

He continued his great-uncle Thomas's practice, as a great benefactor to American colleges, especially [[Harvard]], sending donations and numerous books, often decorated with libertarian symbols. From 1755 his principal American correspondent was [[Jonathan Mayhew]] of Boston, and, after his death in 1766, [[Eliot family (America)|Andrew Eliot]].&lt;ref name="BJRL"/&gt; His other benefactions included substantial donations to [[Berne]] Library and to the [[University of Leiden]] Library.

Hollis was the patron and a friend of [[William Harris (historian)]].

He died suddenly on 1 January 1774. He was unmarried, and after minor legacies left his estates to [[Thomas Brand Hollis|Thomas Brand]], who added Hollis's name to his own.

'''Thomas Jefferson''' (April 13, &amp;#91;[[Old Style and New Style dates|O.S.]] April 2&amp;#93;&amp;nbsp;1743&amp;nbsp;– July 4, 1826) was an American [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Father]] who was the principal author of the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] and later served as the third [[President of the United States]] from 1801 to 1809. Previously, he had been [[United States presidential election, 1796|elected]] the second [[Vice President of the United States]], serving under [[John Adams]] from 1797 to 1801. He was a proponent of democracy, [[republicanism]], and individual rights motivating [[Thirteen Colonies|American colonists]] to break from the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] and form a new nation; he produced formative documents and decisions at both the state and national level.

Jefferson was mainly of English ancestry, born and educated in [[Colony of Virginia|colonial Virginia]]. He graduated from the [[College of William &amp; Mary]] and briefly practiced law, with the largest number of his cases concerning land ownership claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.encyclopediavirginia.org/Jefferson_Thomas_and_the_Practice_of_Law|title=Jefferson, Thomas and the Practice of Law|website=www.encyclopediavirginia.org|language=en|access-date=2018-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[American Revolution]], he represented Virginia in the [[Continental Congress]] that adopted the Declaration, drafted the law for religious freedom as a Virginia legislator, and served as a wartime governor (1779–1781). He became the United States Minister to France in May 1785, and subsequently the nation's first [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] in 1790–1793 under [[George Washington|President George Washington]]. Jefferson and [[James Madison]] organized the [[Democratic-Republican Party]] to oppose the [[Federalist Party]] during the formation of the [[First Party System]]. With Madison, he anonymously wrote the controversial [[Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions]] in 1798–1799, which sought to strengthen [[states' rights]] by nullifying the federal [[Alien and Sedition Acts]].

As President, Jefferson pursued the nation's shipping and trade interests against [[Barbary pirates]] and aggressive British trade policies. He also organized the [[Louisiana Purchase]], almost doubling the country's territory. As a result of peace negotiations with France, his administration reduced military forces. He was [[United States presidential election, 1804|reelected in 1804]]. Jefferson's second term was beset with difficulties at home, including the trial of former Vice President [[Aaron Burr]]. American foreign trade was diminished when Jefferson implemented the [[Embargo Act of 1807]], responding to British threats to U.S. shipping. In 1803, Jefferson began a controversial process of Indian tribe removal to the newly organized [[Louisiana Territory]], and he signed the [[Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves]] in 1807.

Jefferson, while primarily a [[Plantations in the American South#Plantation owner|planter]], lawyer and politician, mastered many disciplines, which ranged from surveying and mathematics to [[horticulture]] and mechanics. He was an architect in the [[classical architecture|classical tradition]]. Jefferson's keen interest in religion and philosophy led to his presidency of the [[American Philosophical Society]]; he shunned organized religion but was influenced by both Christianity and [[deism]]. A [[Philology|philologist]], Jefferson knew several languages. He was a prolific letter writer and corresponded with many prominent people. His only full-length book is ''[[Notes on the State of Virginia]]'' (1785), considered perhaps the most important American book published before 1800.&lt;ref&gt;Bernstein, Richard B. (2004-05-06). Thomas Jefferson: The Revolution of Ideas. Oxford University Press, p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; After retiring from public office, Jefferson founded the [[University of Virginia]].

Although regarded as a leading spokesman for democracy and republicanism in the era of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], Jefferson's historical legacy is mixed. Some modern scholarship has been critical of Jefferson's private life, pointing out the contradiction between his ownership of the large numbers of slaves that worked his plantations and his famous declaration that "all men are created equal." Another point of controversy stems from the evidence that after his wife [[Martha Jefferson|Martha]] died in 1782, Jefferson fathered children with Martha's half-sister, [[Sally Hemings]], who was his slave. Nonetheless, presidential scholars and historians generally praise his public achievements, including his advocacy of religious freedom and tolerance in Virginia. Jefferson continues to [[Historical rankings of Presidents of the United States|rank highly]] among U.S. presidents.

==Early life and career==
{{Main|Early life and career of Thomas Jefferson}}

Thomas Jefferson was born on April 13, 1743 (April 2, 1743, [[Old Style and New Style dates|Old Style]], [[Julian calendar]]), at the family home in [[Shadwell, Virginia|Shadwell]] in the [[Colony of Virginia]], the third of ten children.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Tucker37|Tucker, 1837]], v. 1, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; He was of English, and possibly Welsh, descent and was born a British subject.&lt;ref name=Malone5&gt;[[#Malone48|Malone, 1948]], pp. 5–6.&lt;/ref&gt; His father [[Peter Jefferson]] was a planter and surveyor who died when Jefferson was fourteen; his mother was [[Jane Randolph Jefferson|Jane Randolph]].{{efn|Jefferson personally showed little interest in his ancestry; on his father's side, he only knew of the existence of his grandfather.&lt;ref name=Malone5/&gt;&lt;ref name=Brodie33&gt;[[#Brodie|Brodie, 1974]], pp. 33–34.&lt;/ref&gt; Malone writes that Jefferson vaguely knew that his grandfather "had a place on the Fluvanna River which he called Snowden after a mountain in Wales near which the Jeffersons were supposed to have once lived".&lt;ref name=Malone5/&gt;}} Peter Jefferson moved his family to [[Tuckahoe (plantation)|Tuckahoe Plantation]] in 1745 upon the death of William Randolph, the plantation's owner and Jefferson's friend, who in his will had named him guardian of his children. The Jeffersons returned to Shadwell in 1752, where Peter died in 1757; his estate was divided between his sons Thomas and [[Randolph Jefferson|Randolph]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Malone48|Malone, 1948]], pp. 31–33.&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas inherited approximately {{convert|5,000|acre|ha sqmi|lk=off}} of land, including [[Monticello]]. He assumed full authority over his property at age 21.&lt;ref name=Malone437&gt;[[#Malone48|Malone, 1948]], pp. 437–40.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education, early family life===
[[File:Rear view of the Wren Building, College of William &amp; Mary in Williamsburg, Virginia, USA (2008-04-23).jpg|thumb|alt=A university building|Wren Building (rear), College of William &amp; Mary where Jefferson studied]]
Jefferson began his childhood education beside the [[Randolph family of Virginia|Randolph]] children with tutors at [[Tuckahoe, Virginia|Tuckahoe]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Tucker37|Tucker, 1837]], v. 1, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas' father, Peter, self-taught, regretting not having a formal education, entered Thomas into an English school early, at age five. In 1752, at age nine, he began attending a local school run by a Scottish Presbyterian minister and also began studying the natural world, for which he grew to love. At this time he began studying Latin, Greek, and French, while also learning to ride horses. Thomas also read books from his father's modest library.&lt;ref name=bowers12&gt;[[#Bowers45|Bowers, 1945]], p.12-13&lt;/ref&gt; He was taught from 1758 to 1760 by Reverend [[James Maury]] near [[Gordonsville, Virginia]], where he studied history, science, and the classics while boarding with Maury's family.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Peterson70|Peterson, 1970]], pp. 7–9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bowers12/&gt; During this period Jefferson came to know and befriended various American Indians, including the famous Cherokee chief, ''Ontassete'', who often stopped at Shadwell to visit, on their way to Williamsburg to trade.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bowers45|Bowers, 1945]], p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Meacham|Meacham]], p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; During the two years Jefferson was with the Maury family, he traveled to Williamsburg and was a guest of [[John Dandridge|Colonel Dandridge]], father of [[Martha Washington]]. In Williamsburg the young Jefferson met and came to admire [[Patrick Henry]], who was eight years his senior, sharing a common interest of violin playing.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bowers45|Bowers, 1945]], p. 14–15&lt;/ref&gt;

Jefferson entered the [[College of William &amp; Mary]] in [[Williamsburg, Virginia]], at age 16 and studied mathematics, metaphysics, and philosophy under Professor [[William Small]]. Small introduced him to the [[George Wythe]] and [[Francis Fauquier]] along with [[empiricism|British Empiricists]] including [[John Locke]], [[Francis Bacon]], and [[Isaac Newton]]. Small, Wythe and Fauquier recognized in Jefferson a man of exceptional ability and included him in their inner circle where the young Jefferson became a regular member of their Friday dinner parties where such men gathered and discussed politics and philosophy. Jefferson later wrote that he "heard more common good sense, more rational &amp; philosophical conversations than in all the rest of my life".&lt;ref&gt;[[#boles|Boles, 2017]], p. 17; [[#Bowers45|&amp;nbsp;Bowers,1945]], p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; During his first year at the college he was given more to parties, dancing and was not very frugal with his expenditures; during his second year, regretting that he had squandered away much time and money, he applied himself to fifteen hours of study a day.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bowers45|&amp;nbsp;Bowers,1945]], pp. 22–23; [[#boles|Boles, 2017]], p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; Jefferson improved his French and Greek and his skill at the violin. He graduated two years after starting in 1762. He [[reading law|read the law]] under Professor Wythe's tutelage to obtain his law license, while working as a [[law clerk]] in his office.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Meacham|Meacham, 2012]], pp. 29, 39.&lt;/ref&gt; He also read a wide variety of English classics and political works.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Meacham|Meacham, 2012]], pp. 19, 28–29.&lt;/ref&gt; Jefferson was well read in a broad variety of subjects, which along with law and philosophy, included history, natural law, natural religion, ethics, and several areas in science, including agriculture. Overall, he drew very deeply on the philosophers. During the years of study under the watchful eye of Wythe, Jefferson authored a survey of his extensive readings in his ''Commonplace Book''.&lt;ref&gt;[[#chinard|Chinard, 1926]], book cover&lt;/ref&gt; So impressed with Jefferson, Wythe would later bequeath his entire library to him.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bowers45|Bowers, 1945]], pp.32–34; [[#boles|&amp;nbsp;Boles, 2017]], p. 19;&lt;/ref&gt;

1765 was an eventful year in Jefferson's family. In July, his sister Martha married his close friend and college companion [[Dabney Carr]], which greatly pleased Jefferson. In October, he mourned his sister Jane's unexpected death at age 25 and wrote a farewell epitaph in Latin.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Meacham|Meacham, 2012]], p. 37&lt;/ref&gt;
Jefferson treasured his books. In 1770, his Shadwell home was destroyed by fire, including a library of 200 volumes inherited from his father and those left to him by George Wythe.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Tucker37|Tucker, 1837]], v. 1, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, he had replenished his library with 1,250 titles by 1773, and his collection grew to almost 6,500 volumes in 1814.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ferling2000|Ferling, 2000]], p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; The British burned the [[Library of Congress]] that year; he then sold more than 6,000 books to the Library for $23,950. He had intended to pay off some of his large debt, but he resumed collecting for his personal library, writing to [[John Adams]], "I cannot live without books."&lt;ref name=library&gt;[[#Library|Library of Congress]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#boles|Boles, 2017]], p. 458&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lawyer and House of Burgesses===
[[File:House of Burgesses in the Capitol Williamsburg James City County Virginia by Frances Benjamin Johnston.jpg|thumb|alt=Chamber of House of Burgesses|House of Burgesses in Williamsburg, Virginia, where Jefferson served 1769–1775]]
Jefferson was admitted to the Virginia bar in 1767 and then lived with his mother at Shadwell.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Meacham|Meacham, 2012]], pp. 11, 49.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to practicing law, Jefferson represented [[Albemarle County, Virginia|Albemarle County]] as a delegate in the Virginia [[House of Burgesses]] from 1769 until 1775.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Tucker37|Tucker, 1837]], v. 1, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; He pursued reforms to slavery. He introduced legislation in 1769 allowing masters to take control over the emancipation of slaves, taking discretion away from the royal governor and General Court. He persuaded his cousin [[Richard Bland]] to spearhead the legislation's passage, but reaction was strongly negative.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Meacham|Meacham, 2012]], pp. 47–49.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jefferson took seven cases for freedom-seeking slaves&lt;ref&gt;[[#Gordon08|Gordon-Reed, 2008]], p. 348.&lt;/ref&gt; and waived his fee for one client, who claimed that he should be freed before the statutory age of thirty-one required for emancipation in cases with inter-racial grandparents.&lt;ref name=Gordon99&gt;[[#Gordon08|Gordon-Reed, 2008]], pp. 99–100.&lt;/ref&gt; He invoked the [[Natural law|Natural Law]] to argue, "everyone comes into the world with a right to his own person and using it at his own will&amp;nbsp;... This is what is called personal liberty, and is given him by the author of nature, because it is necessary for his own sustenance." The judge cut him off and ruled against his client. As a consolation, Jefferson gave his client some money, conceivably used to aid his escape shortly thereafter.&lt;ref name=Gordon99/&gt; He later incorporated this sentiment into the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Meacham|Meacham, 2012]], p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; He also took on 68 cases for the General Court of Virginia in 1767, in addition to three notable cases: ''Howell v. Netherland'' (1770), ''Bolling v. Bolling'' (1771), and ''Blair v. Blair'' (1772).&lt;ref name=Konig_Time_Line&gt;[[#Konig1|Konig, David T., Encyclopedia Virginia]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The British Parliament passed the [[Intolerable Acts]] in 1774, and Jefferson wrote a resolution calling for a "Day of Fasting and Prayer" in protest, as well as a boycott of all British goods. His resolution was later expanded into ''[[A Summary View of the Rights of British America]]'', in which he argued that people have the right to [[Self-governing colony|govern themselves]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Meacham|Meacham, 2012]], pp. 71–73.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Monticello, marriage and family===
[[File:Monticello 2010-10-29.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Monticello plantation house|Jefferson's home Monticello]]
In 1768, Jefferson began constructing his primary residence Monticello (Italian for "Little Mountain") on a hilltop overlooking his {{convert|5000|acre|sqkm sqmi|adj=on}} plantation.{{efn|His other properties included [[Shadwell (Virginia)|Shadwell]], Tufton, Lego, Pantops, and his retreat [[Poplar Forest]]. He also owned the unimproved mountaintop Montalto, and the Natural Bridge.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bear|Bear, 1967]], p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt;}} Construction was done mostly by local masons and carpenters, assisted by Jefferson's slaves.&lt;ref&gt;[[#TJFSlaveBuilders|TJF: Monticello (House) FAQ – "Who built the house?"]]&lt;/ref&gt;

He moved into the South Pavilion in 1770. Turning Monticello into a neoclassical masterpiece in the [[Palladian architecture|Palladian]] style was his perennial project.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ellis96|Ellis, 1996]], pp. 142–44.&lt;/ref&gt;
On January 1, 1772, Jefferson married his third cousin Martha Wayles Skelton, the 23-year-old widow of Bathurst Skelton, and she moved into the South Pavilion.&lt;ref name="Tucker p.47"&gt;[[#Tucker37|Tucker, 1837]], v. 1, p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Roberts93|Roberts, 1993]]&lt;/ref&gt; She was a frequent hostess for Jefferson and managed the large household. Biographer [[Dumas Malone]] described the marriage as the happiest period of Jefferson's life.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Malone48|Malone, 1948]], p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; Martha read widely, did fine needlework, and was a skilled pianist; Jefferson often accompanied her on the violin or cello.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Malone48|Malone, 1948]], pp. 47, 158.&lt;/ref&gt; During their ten years of marriage, Martha bore six children: [[Martha Jefferson Randolph|Martha]] "Patsy" (1772–1836); Jane (1774–1775); a son who lived for only a few weeks in 1777; [[Mary Jefferson Eppes|Mary Wayles]] "Polly" (1778–1804); Lucy Elizabeth (1780–1781); and another Lucy Elizabeth (1782–1785).{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} Only Martha and Mary survived more than a few years.&lt;ref name="Martha"&gt;[[#Skelton|White House Archives]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Martha Jefferson Randolph portrait.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.8|[[Martha Jefferson Randolph|Jefferson's daughter Martha]]]] Martha's father John Wayles died in 1773, and the couple inherited 135 people of color who were legally enslaved, {{convert|11,000|acre|sqkm sqmi|lk=off}}, and the estate's debts. The debts took Jefferson years to satisfy, contributing to his financial problems.&lt;ref name="Tucker p.47"/&gt;

Martha later suffered from ill health, including diabetes, and frequent childbirth further weakened her. Her mother had died young, and Martha lived with two stepmothers as a girl. A few months after the birth of her last child, she died on September 6, 1782, at the age of 33 with Jefferson at her bedside. Shortly before her death, Martha made Jefferson promise never to marry again, telling him that she could not bear to have another mother raise her children.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Gordon08|Gordon-Reed, 2008]], p. 145; [[#Meacham|Meacham, 2012]], p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; Jefferson was grief-stricken by her death, relentlessly pacing back and forth, nearly to the point of exhaustion. He emerged after three weeks, taking long rambling rides on secluded roads with his daughter Martha, by her description "a solitary witness to many a violent burst of grief".&lt;ref name="Martha"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Halliday48"&gt;[[#Halliday09|Halliday, 2009]], pp. 48–53.&lt;/ref&gt;

After working as Secretary of State (1790–93), he returned to Monticello and initiated a remodeling based on the architectural concepts which he had acquired in Europe. The work continued throughout most of his presidency, being finished in 1809.&lt;ref&gt;[[#TJFHouseConstruction|TJF:Monticello Construction]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bernstein03|Bernstein, 2003]], p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political career 1775–1800==

===Declaration of Independence===
[[File:Us declaration independence.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Declaration of Independence|U.S. Declaration of Independence – 1823 facsimile of the engrossed copy]]
{{Main|United States Declaration of Independence}}
Jefferson was the primary author of the Declaration of Independence. The document's social and political ideals were proposed by Jefferson before the inauguration of Washington.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bowers45|Bowers, 1945]], p. v&lt;/ref&gt; At age 33, he was one of the youngest delegates to the [[Second Continental Congress]] beginning in 1775 at the outbreak of the [[American Revolutionary War]], where a formal declaration of independence from Britain was overwhelmingly favored.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Tucker37|Tucker, 1837]], v. 1, p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt; Jefferson chose his words for the Declaration in June 1775, shortly after the war had begun, where the idea of independence from Britain had long since become popular among the colonies. He was inspired by the Enlightenment ideals of the sanctity of the individual, as well as by the writings of Locke and Montesquieu.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Meacham|Meacham, 2012]], pp. 103–04.&lt;/ref&gt;

He sought out John Adams, an emerging leader of the Congress.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Peterson70|Peterson, 1970]], p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt; They became close friends and Adams supported Jefferson's appointment to the [[Committee of Five]] formed to draft a declaration of independence in furtherance of the [[Lee Resolution]] passed by the Congress, which declared the United Colonies independent. The committee initially thought that Adams should write the document, but Adams persuaded the committee to choose Jefferson.{{efn|Adams recorded his exchange with Jefferson on the question. Jefferson asked, "Why will you not? You ought to do it." To which Adams responded, "I will not—reasons enough." Jefferson replied, "What can be your reasons?" And Adams responded, "Reason first, you are a Virginian, and a Virginian ought to appear at the head of this business. Reason second, I am obnoxious, suspected, and unpopular. You are very much otherwise. Reason third, you can write ten times better than I can." "Well," said Jefferson, "if you are decided, I will do as well as I can." Adams concluded, "Very well. When you have drawn it up, we will have a meeting."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Meacham|Meacham, 2012]], p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Jefferson consulted with other committee members over the next seventeen days, and drew on his own proposed draft of the [[Constitution of Virginia|Virginia Constitution]], [[George Mason]]'s draft of the [[Virginia Declaration of Rights]], and other sources.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Maier|Maier, 1997]], p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt; The other committee members made some changes, and a final draft was presented to the Congress on June 28, 1776.&lt;ref name="Meacham, 2012, p. 105"&gt;[[#Meacham|Meacham, 2012]], p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt;

The declaration was introduced on Friday, June 28, and congress began debate over its contents on Monday, July 1,&lt;ref name="Meacham, 2012, p. 105"/&gt; resulting in the omission of a fourth of the text, including a passage critical of King George III and the slave trade.&lt;ref name="Ellis, 1996, p. 50"&gt;[[#Ellis96|Ellis, 1996]], p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; Jefferson resented the changes, but he did not speak publicly about the revisions.{{efn|Franklin, seated beside the author, observed him "writhing a little under the acrimonious criticisms on some of its parts."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Tucker37|Tucker, 1837]], p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt;}} On July 4, 1776, the Congress [[Ratification#United States|ratified]] the Declaration, and delegates signed it on August 2; in doing so, they were committing an act of treason against the Crown.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Meacham|Meacham, 2012]], p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt; Jefferson's preamble is regarded as an enduring statement of human rights, and the phrase "[[all men are created equal]]" has been called "one of the best-known sentences in the English language" containing "the most potent and consequential words in American history".&lt;ref name="Ellis, 1996, p. 50"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ellis2008|Ellis, 2008]], pp. 55–56.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Virginia state legislator and governor===
[[File:Colonial Williamsburg Governors Palace Front Dscn7232.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.3|alt=Governor's Palace|[[Governor's Palace (Williamsburg, Virginia)|Governor's Palace]], Governor Jefferson's residence in Williamsburg]]
At the start of the Revolution, Jefferson was a [[Colonel (United States)|Colonel]] and was named commander of the [[Albemarle County, Virginia|Albemarle County]] Militia on September 26, 1775.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Brodie|Brodie, 1974]], p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt; He was then elected to the [[Virginia House of Delegates]] for Albemarle County in September 1776, when finalizing a state constitution was a priority.&lt;ref name="Peterson pp. 101"&gt;[[#Peterson70|Peterson, 1970]], pp. 101–02, 114, 140.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Fer26&gt;[[#Ferling04|Ferling, 2004]], p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;
For nearly three years, he assisted with the constitution and was especially proud of his Bill for Establishing Religious Freedom, which forbade state support of religious institutions or enforcement of religious doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Tucker37|Tucker, 1837]], v. 1, p. 102; [[#Bernstein03|Bernstein, 2003]], p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; The bill failed to pass, as did his legislation to disestablish the Anglican church, but both were later revived by [[James Madison]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Peterson70|Peterson, 1970]], pp. 134, 142; [[#Bernstein03|Bernstein, 2003]], pp. 68–69.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1778, Jefferson was given the task of revising the state's laws. He drafted 126 bills in three years, including laws to streamline the judicial system. Jefferson's proposed statutes provided for general education, which he considered the basis of "republican government".&lt;ref name="Peterson pp. 101"/&gt; He had become alarmed that Virginia's powerful landed gentry were becoming a hereditary aristocracy. He took the lead in abolishing what he called "feudal and unnatural distinctions." He targeted laws such as [[entail]] and [[primogeniture]] by which the oldest son inherited all the land. The [[Fee tail|entail]] laws made it perpetual: the one who inherited the land could not sell it, but had to bequeath it to his oldest son. As a result, increasingly large plantations, worked by white tenant farmers and by black slaves, gained in size and wealth and political power in the eastern ("Tidewater") tobacco areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Brewer | first1 = Holly | year = 1997 | title = Entailing Aristocracy in Colonial Virginia: 'Ancient Feudal Restraints' and Revolutionary Reform | journal = William and Mary Quarterly | volume = 54 | issue = 2| pages = 307–46 | jstor=2953276 | doi=10.2307/2953276}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the Revolutionary era, all such laws were repealed by the states that had them.&lt;ref&gt;Richard B. Morris, "Primogeniture and Entailed Estates in America," ''Columbia Law  Review'', 27 (Jan. 1927), 24–51. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1113540 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

Jefferson was elected [[Governor of Virginia|governor]] for one-year terms in 1779 and 1780.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Tucker37|Tucker, 1837]], v. 1, p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt; He transferred the state capital from Williamsburg to [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]], and introduced measures for public education, religious freedom, and revision of inheritance laws.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Tucker37|Tucker, 1837]], v. 1, p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt;

During General [[Benedict Arnold]]'s 1781 invasion of Virginia, Jefferson escaped Richmond just ahead of the British forces, and the city was burned to the ground.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Peterson70|Peterson, 1970]], pp. 234–38.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Meacham|Meacham, 2012]], pp. 133–35; [[#Ellis96|Ellis, 1996]], p. 66; [[#Gordon08|Gordon-Reed, 2008]], pp. 136–37.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis|General Charles Cornwallis]] that spring dispatched a cavalry force led by [[Banastre Tarleton]] to capture Jefferson and members of the Assembly at Monticello, but [[Jack Jouett]] of the [[Virginia militia]] thwarted the British plan. Jefferson escaped to [[Poplar Forest]], his plantation to the west.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Tucker37|Tucker, 1837]], v. 1, p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt; When the General Assembly reconvened in June 1781, it conducted an inquiry into Jefferson's actions which eventually concluded that Jefferson had acted with honor—but he was not re-elected.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Meacham|Meacham, 2012]], pp. 140–42.&lt;/ref&gt;

In April of the same year, his daughter Lucy died at age one. A second daughter of that name was born the following year, but she died at age three.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Tucker37|Tucker, 1837]], v. 1, p. 263.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Notes on the State of Virginia''===
{{Main|Notes on the State of Virginia}}
Jefferson received a letter of inquiry in 1780 about the geography, history, and government of Virginia from French diplomat [[François Barbé-Marbois]], who was gathering data on the United States. Jefferson included his written responses in a book, ''Notes on the State of Virginia'' (1785).&lt;ref&gt;[[#Tucker37|Tucker, 1837]], v. 1, pp. 165–66.&lt;/ref&gt; He compiled the book over five years, including reviews of scientific knowledge, Virginia's history, politics, laws, culture, and geography.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Shuffelton|Shuffelton, 1999]]&lt;/ref&gt; The book explores what constitutes a good society, using Virginia as an exemplar. Jefferson included extensive data about the state's natural resources and economy, and wrote at length about slavery, [[miscegenation]], and his belief that blacks and whites could not live together as free people in one society because of justified resentments of the enslaved.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Jeff Notes|Notes on the State of Virginia]], p. 149; [[#Burstein2006|Burstein, 2006]], p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt; He also wrote of his views on the American Indian and considered them as equals in body and mind to European settlers.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Jeff Notes|''Notes on the State of Virginia'', 1853, Query XI]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#TJFEnlightenment|TJF: Thomas Jefferson's Enlightenment and American Indians]]&lt;/ref&gt;

''Notes'' was first published in 1785 in French and appeared in English in 1787.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bernstein2004|Bernstein, 2004]], p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; Biographer [[George Tucker (politician)|George Tucker]] considered the work "surprising in the extent of the information which a single individual had been thus able to acquire, as to the physical features of the state",&lt;ref&gt;[[#Tucker37|Tucker, 1837]], v. 1, p. 166.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Merrill D. Peterson]] described it as an accomplishment for which all Americans should be grateful.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Peterson70|Peterson, 1970]], ch. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Member of Congress===
[[File:Independence Hall Assembly Room.jpg|thumb|alt=Legislative chamber|Independence Hall Assembly Room where Jefferson served in Congress]]
The United States formed a [[Congress of the Confederation]] following victory in the Revolutionary War and a [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|peace treaty]] with Great Britain in 1783, to which Jefferson was appointed as a Virginia delegate. He was a member of the committee setting foreign exchange rates and [[Plan for Establishing Uniformity in the Coinage, Weights, and Measures of the United States|recommended]] an American currency based on the decimal system which was adopted.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Tucker37|Tucker, 1837]], v. 1, pp. 172–73.&lt;/ref&gt; He advised formation of the [[Committee of the States]] to fill the power vacuum when Congress was in recess.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Peterson70|Peterson, 1970]], p. 275.&lt;/ref&gt; The Committee met when Congress adjourned, but disagreements rendered it dysfunctional.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Rayner34|Rayner, 1834]], p. 207.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Congress's 1783–84 session, Jefferson acted as chairman of committees to establish a viable system of government for the new Republic and to propose a policy for the settlement of the western territories. Jefferson was the principal author of the [[Land Ordinance of 1784]], whereby Virginia ceded to the national government the vast area that it claimed northwest of the [[Ohio River]]. He insisted that this territory should not be used as colonial territory by any of the thirteen states, but that it should be divided into sections which could become states. He plotted borders for nine new states in their initial stages and wrote an ordinance banning slavery in all the nation's territories. Congress made extensive revisions, including rejection of the ban on slavery.&lt;ref name=Peretson189&gt;[[#Peterson60|Peterson, 1960]], pp. 189–90.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Finkelman1989|Finkelman, 1989]], pp. 21–51.&lt;/ref&gt; The provisions banning slavery were known later as the "Jefferson Proviso;" they were modified and implemented three years later in the [[Northwest Ordinance]] of 1787 and became the law for the entire Northwest.&lt;ref name=Peretson189/&gt;

===Minister to France===
[[File:Mather Brown - Thomas Jefferson - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Young Thomas Jefferson|Portrait of Thomas Jefferson while in London in 1786 by [[Mather Brown]]]]

In 1784, Jefferson was sent by the [[Congress of the Confederation]]{{efn|the immediate successor to the [[Second Continental Congress]]}} to join Benjamin Franklin and John Adams in Paris as Minister [[Plenipotentiary]] for Negotiating Treaties of Amity and Commerce with [[Great Britain]], [[Russia]], [[Austria]], [[Prussia]], [[Denmark]], [[Electorate of Saxony|Saxony]], [[Hamburg]], [[Spain]], [[Portugal]], [[Kingdom of Naples|Naples]], [[Kingdom of Sardinia|Sardinia]], [[The Pope]], [[Republic of Venice|Venice]], [[Republic of Genoa|Genoa]], [[Grand Duchy of Tuscany|Tuscany]], the [[Sublime Porte]], [[Morocco]], [[Algeria|Algiers]], [[Tunisia|Tunis]], and [[Kingdom of Tripoli|Tripoli]].&lt;ref&gt;"Enclosure I: Commission for Negotiating Treaties of Amity and Commerce, 16 May 1784," Founders Online, National Archives, last modified June 13, 2018, http://founders.archives.gov/documents/Jefferson/01-07-02-0214. [Original source: The Papers of Thomas Jefferson, vol. 7, 2 March 1784 – 25 February 1785, ed. Julian P. Boyd. Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1953, pp. 262–265.]&lt;/ref&gt;  Some believed that the recently widowed Jefferson was depressed and that the assignment would distract him from his wife's death.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Peterson70|Peterson, 1970]], pp. 289–94.&lt;/ref&gt; With his young daughter Patsy and two servants, he departed in July 1784, arriving in Paris the next month.&lt;ref name=Stewart39&gt;[[#Stewart97|Stewart, 1997]], p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Meacham|Meacham, 2012]], p. 180.&lt;/ref&gt; Less than a year later he was assigned the additional duty of succeeding Franklin as Minister to France. French foreign minister [[Charles Gravier, comte de Vergennes|Count de Vergennes]] commented, "You replace Monsieur Franklin, I hear." Jefferson replied, "I ''succeed''. No man can replace him."&lt;ref&gt;[[#McCullough|McCullough, 2001]], p. 330.&lt;/ref&gt; During his five years in Paris Jefferson played a leading role in shaping the foreign policy of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bowers45|Bowers, 1945]], pp.vii-viii&lt;/ref&gt;

Jefferson had Patsy educated at the [[Pentemont Abbey]]. In 1786, he met and fell in love with [[Maria Cosway]], an accomplished—and married—Italian-English musician of 27. They saw each other frequently over a period of six weeks. She returned to Great Britain, but they maintained a lifelong correspondence.&lt;ref&gt;[[#TJFMariaCosway|TJF: Maria Cosway (Engraving)]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Jefferson sent for his youngest surviving child, nine-year-old Polly, in June 1787, who was accompanied on her voyage by a young slave from Monticello, [[Sally Hemings]]. Jefferson had taken her older brother [[James Hemings]] to Paris as part of his domestic staff, and had him trained in French cuisine.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Gordon08|Gordon-Reed, 2008]], pp. 156, 164–68.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Sally's son, [[Madison Hemings]], the 16-year-old Sally and Jefferson began a sexual relationship in Paris, where she became pregnant.&lt;ref name="madisonstatement"&gt;{{cite web|title=Memoirs of Madison Hemings|url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/jefferson/cron/1873march.html|work=Frontline|publisher=Public Broadcasting Service – WGBH Boston|accessdate=November 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to his account, Hemings agreed to return to the United States only after Jefferson promised to free her children when they came of age.&lt;ref name="madisonstatement"/&gt;

While in France, Jefferson became a regular companion of the [[Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette|Marquis de Lafayette]], a [[France in the American Revolutionary War|French hero of the American Revolutionary War]], and Jefferson used his influence to procure trade agreements with France.&lt;ref name=Bowers328&gt;[[#Bowers45|Bowers, 1945]], p. 328.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Burstein120&gt;[[#Burstein10|Burstein, 2010]], p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt; As the [[French Revolution]] began, Jefferson allowed his Paris residence, the [[Hôtel de Langeac]], to be used for meetings by Lafayette and other republicans. He was in Paris during the storming of the Bastille&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jefferson|first1=Thomas|title=Letter from Thomas Jefferson to John Jay|url=https://research.archives.gov/id/783912|website=National Archives|publisher=National Archives at Washington, DC|accessdate=January 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and consulted with Lafayette while the latter drafted the [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Meacham|Meacham, 2012]], pp. 222–23.&lt;/ref&gt; Jefferson often found his mail opened by postmasters, so he invented his own enciphering device, the "[[Jefferson disk|Wheel Cipher]]"; he wrote important communications in code for the rest of his career.&lt;ref&gt;[[#TJFCode|TJF: Coded Messages]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|An example can be seen at the [http://memory.loc.gov/mss/mgw/mgw4/098/0500/0595.jpg  Library of Congress website].}} Jefferson left Paris for America in September 1789, intending to return soon; however, President [[George Washington]] appointed him the country's first Secretary of State, forcing him to remain in the nation's capitol.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ellis96|Ellis, 1996]], pp. 116–17.&lt;/ref&gt; Jefferson remained a firm supporter of the French Revolution, while opposing its more violent elements.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ellis96|Ellis, 1996]], p. 110; [[#Wood2010|Wood, 2010]], pp. 179–81.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Secretary of State===

[[File:T Jefferson by Charles Willson Peale 1791 2.jpg|right|upright=0.9|thumb|alt=Thomas Jefferson |Thomas Jefferson in 1791 at 49 by [[Charles Willson Peale]]]]
Soon after returning from France, Jefferson accepted Washington's invitation to serve as [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Tucker37|Tucker, 1837]], v. 1, p. 334.&lt;/ref&gt; Pressing issues at this time were the national debt and the permanent location of the capital. Jefferson opposed a national debt, preferring that each state retire its own, in contrast to [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|Secretary of the Treasury]] [[Alexander Hamilton]], who desired consolidation of various states' debts by the federal government.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Tucker37|Tucker, 1837]], v. 1, pp. 364–69.&lt;/ref&gt; Hamilton also had bold plans to establish the national credit and a national bank, but Jefferson strenuously opposed this and attempted to undermine his agenda, which nearly led Washington to dismiss him from his cabinet. Jefferson later left the cabinet voluntarily; Washington never forgave him, and never spoke to him again.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Chernow|Chernow, 2004]], p. 427.&lt;/ref&gt;

The second major issue was the capital's permanent location. Hamilton favored a capital close to the major commercial centers of the Northeast, while Washington, Jefferson, and other agrarians wanted it located to the south.&lt;ref name="Cooke, 1970, pp. 523–45"&gt;[[#Cooke|Cooke, 1970]], pp. 523–45.&lt;/ref&gt; After lengthy deadlock, the [[Compromise of 1790]] was struck, permanently locating the capital on the Potomac River, and the federal government assumed the war debts of all thirteen states.&lt;ref name="Cooke, 1970, pp. 523–45"/&gt;

In the Spring of 1791, Jefferson and Congressman James Madison took a vacation to [[Vermont]]. Jefferson had been suffering from migraines and he was tired of Hamilton in-fighting.&lt;ref name=Randall_1996_p1&gt;[[#Randall 1996|Randall (1996)]], p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1792, Jefferson was alarmed at the political rivalries taking shape; he wrote to Washington, urging him to run for re-election that year as a unifying influence.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Tucker37|Tucker, 1837]], v. 1, p. 429.&lt;/ref&gt; He urged the president to rally the citizenry to a party that would defend democracy against the corrupting influence of banks and monied interests, as espoused by the Federalists. Historians recognize this letter as the earliest delineation of [[Democratic-Republican Party]] principles.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Greider2010|Greider, 2010]], p. 246.&lt;/ref&gt; Jefferson, Madison, and other Democratic-Republican organizers favored [[states' rights]] and local control and opposed federal concentration of power, whereas Hamilton sought more power for the federal government.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Wood2010|Wood, 2010]], pp. 145–49.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jefferson supported France against Britain when the two nations fought in 1793, though his arguments in the Cabinet were undercut by French Revolutionary envoy [[Edmond-Charles Genêt]]'s open scorn for President Washington.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Wood2010|Wood, 2010]], pp. 186–88.&lt;/ref&gt; In his discussions with British Minister [[George Hammond (diplomat)|George Hammond]], Jefferson tried unsuccessfully to persuade the British to acknowledge their violation of the Treaty of Paris, to vacate their posts in the Northwest, and to compensate the U.S. for slaves whom the British had freed at the end of the war. Seeking a return to private life, Jefferson resigned the cabinet position in December 1793, perhaps to bolster his political influence from outside the administration.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ellis96|Ellis, 1996]], p. 119; [[#Meacham|Meacham, 2012]], pp. 283–84; [[#Tucker37|Tucker, 1837]], v. 1, p. 523.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Washington administration negotiated the [[Jay Treaty]] with Great Britain (1794), Jefferson saw a cause around which to rally his party and organized a national opposition from Monticello.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Meacham|Meacham, 2012]], pp. 293–94.&lt;/ref&gt; The treaty, designed by Hamilton, aimed to reduce tensions and increase trade. Jefferson warned that it would increase British influence and subvert republicanism, calling it "the boldest act [Hamilton and Jay] ever ventured on to undermine the government".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Peterson70|Peterson, 1970]], ch.8 [e-book].&lt;/ref&gt; The Treaty passed, but it expired in 1805 during Jefferson's administration and was not renewed. Jefferson continued his pro-French stance; during the violence of the [[Reign of Terror]], he declined to disavow the revolution: "To back away from France would be to undermine the cause of republicanism in America."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Yarbrough2006|Yarbrough, 2006]], p. xx.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Election of 1796 and Vice Presidency===
{{further|United States presidential election, 1796|Democratic-Republican Party}}
[[File:ElectoralCollege1796.svg|thumb|right|alt=Electoral College map|1796 election results]]
In the presidential campaign of 1796, Jefferson lost the electoral college vote to Federalist John Adams by 71–68 and was elected vice president because of a mistake in voting for Adams's running mate. As presiding officer of the Senate, he assumed a more passive role than his predecessor John Adams. He allowed the Senate to freely conduct debates and confined his participation to procedural issues, which he called an "honorable and easy" role.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Meacham|Meacham, 2012]], p. 305.&lt;/ref&gt; Jefferson had previously studied parliamentary law and procedure for 40 years, making him unusually well qualified to serve as presiding officer. In 1800, he published his assembled notes on Senate procedure as ''[[Jefferson's Manual|A Manual of Parliamentary Practice]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bernstein03|Bernstein, 2003]], pp. 117–18.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jefferson held four confidential talks with French consul Joseph Létombe in the spring of 1797 where he attacked Adams, predicting that his rival would serve only one term. He also encouraged France to invade England, and advised Létombe to stall any American envoys sent to Paris by instructing him to "listen to them and then drag out the negotiations at length and mollify them by the urbanity of the proceedings."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Elkins1994|Elkins, 1994]], p. 566.&lt;/ref&gt; This toughened the tone that the French government adopted toward the Adams administration. After Adams's initial peace envoys were rebuffed, Jefferson and his supporters lobbied for the release of papers related to the incident, called the [[XYZ Affair]] after the letters used to disguise the identities of the French officials involved.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Chernow04|Chernow, 2004]], p. 550.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the tactic backfired when it was revealed that French officials had demanded bribes, rallying public support against France. The U.S. began an undeclared naval war with France known as the [[Quasi-War]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Meacham|Meacham, 2012]], p. 312.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Adams presidency, the Federalists rebuilt the military, levied new taxes, and enacted the [[Alien and Sedition Acts]]. Jefferson believed that these laws were intended to suppress Democratic-Republicans, rather than prosecute enemy aliens, and considered them unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Tucker37|Tucker, 1837]], v. 2, p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; To rally opposition, he and James Madison anonymously wrote the [[Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions]], declaring that the federal government had no right to exercise powers not specifically delegated to it by the states.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Wood2010|Wood, 2010]], pp. 269–71.&lt;/ref&gt; The resolutions followed the "[[interposition]]" approach of Madison, in which states may shield their citizens from federal laws that they deem unconstitutional. Jefferson advocated [[Nullification (U.S. Constitution)|nullification]], allowing states to invalidate federal laws altogether.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Meacham|Meacham, 2012]], p. 318.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|Jefferson's Kentucky draft said: "where powers are assumed which have not been delegated, a nullification of the act is the rightful remedy: that every State has a natural right in cases not within the compact, (casus non fœderis) to nullify of their own authority all assumptions of power by others within their limits."&lt;ref&gt;[[#UCP|Thomas Jefferson, Resolutions Relative to the Alien and Sedition Acts, 1798]]&lt;/ref&gt;}} Jefferson warned that, "unless arrested at the threshold", the Alien and Sedition Acts would "necessarily drive these states into revolution and blood".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Onuf2000|Onuf, 2000]], p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian [[Ron Chernow]] claims that "the theoretical damage of the Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions was deep and lasting, and was a recipe for disunion", contributing to the [[American Civil War]] as well as later events.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Chernow04|Chernow, 2004]], p. 574.&lt;/ref&gt; Washington was so appalled by the resolutions that he told Patrick Henry that, if "systematically and pertinaciously pursued", the resolutions would "dissolve the union or produce coercion."&lt;ref name="Chernow587"&gt;[[#Chernow04|Chernow, 2004]], p. 587.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jefferson and Madison moved to Philadelphia and founded the [[National Gazette]] in 1791, along with poet and writer [[Phillip Freneau]], in an effort to counter Hamilton's Federalist policies, which Hamilton was promoting through the influential Federalist newspaper the [[Gazette of the United States]]. The National Gazette made particular criticism of the policies promoted by Alexander Hamilton, often through anonymous essays signed by the pen name ''Brutus'' at Jefferson's urging, which were actually written by Madison.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bernstein03|Bernstein, 2003]], p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jefferson had always admired Washington's leadership skills but felt that his Federalist party was leading the country in the wrong direction. Jefferson thought it wise not to attend his funeral in 1799 because of acute differences with Washington while serving as Secretary of State, and remained at Monticello.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Meacham|Meacham, 2012]], p. 323.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Election of 1800===
[[File:ElectoralCollege1800.svg|thumb|right|alt=Electoral College map|1800 election results]]
{{Main|United States presidential election, 1800}}
In the 1800 presidential election, Jefferson contended once more against Federalist John Adams. Adams's campaign was weakened by unpopular taxes and vicious Federalist infighting over his actions in the Quasi-War.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bernstein03|Bernstein, 2003]], pp. 126–28; [[#McCullough|McCullough, 2001]], p. 556.&lt;/ref&gt; Republicans pointed to the Alien and Sedition Acts and accused the Federalists of being secret monarchists, while Federalists charged that Jefferson was a godless libertine in thrall to the French.&lt;ref&gt;[[#McCullough|McCullough, 2001]], pp. 543–44.&lt;/ref&gt; Historian Joyce Appleby said the election was "one of the most acrimonious in the annals of American history".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Appleby|Appleby, 2003]], pp. 27–28.&lt;/ref&gt;

Republicans ultimately won more electoral college votes, but Jefferson and his vice presidential candidate [[Aaron Burr]] unexpectedly received an equal total. Due to the tie, the election was decided by the Federalist-dominated House of Representatives.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Tucker37|Tucker, 1837]], v. 2, p. 75; [[#Wood2010|Wood, 2010]], p. 278.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|This electoral process problem was addressed by the [[Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] in 1804, which provided separate votes for presidential and vice presidential candidates.&lt;ref name=W284/&gt;}} Hamilton lobbied Federalist representatives on Jefferson's behalf, believing him a lesser political evil than Burr. On February 17, 1801, after thirty-six ballots, the House elected Jefferson president and Burr vice president.&lt;ref name=W284/&gt;

The win was marked by Republican celebrations throughout the country.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Meacham|Meacham, 2012]], pp. 340–41.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of Jefferson's opponents argued that he owed his victory over Adams to the South's inflated number of electors, due to counting slaves as partial population under the [[Three-Fifths Compromise]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ferling04|Ferling, 2004]], p. 208.&lt;/ref&gt; Others alleged that Jefferson secured [[James A. Bayard (elder)|James Asheton Bayard]]'s tie-breaking electoral vote by guaranteeing the retention of various Federalist posts in the government.&lt;ref name=W284&gt;[[#Wood2010|Wood, 2010]], pp. 284–85.&lt;/ref&gt; Jefferson disputed the allegation, and the historical record is inconclusive.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Meacham|Meacham, 2012]], pp. 337–38.&lt;/ref&gt;

The transition proceeded smoothly, marking a watershed in American history. As historian [[Gordon S. Wood]] writes, "it was one of the first popular elections in modern history that resulted in the peaceful transfer of power from one 'party' to another."&lt;ref name=W284/&gt;

Jefferson was sworn in by [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]] [[John Marshall]] at the new Capitol in Washington, D.C. on March 4, 1801. In contrast to his predecessors, Jefferson exhibited a dislike of formal etiquette; he arrived alone on horseback without escort, dressed plainly&lt;ref&gt;[[#Wood2010|Wood, 2010]], pp. 287–88.&lt;/ref&gt; and, after dismounting, retired his own horse to the nearby stable.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hale1896|Hale, 1896]], Illustrious Americans, p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt; His inaugural address struck a note of reconciliation, declaring, "We have been called by different names brethren of the same principle. We are all Republicans, we are all Federalists."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Meacham|Meacham, 2012]], pp. 348–50.&lt;/ref&gt; Ideologically, Jefferson stressed "equal and exact justice to all men", minority rights, and freedom of speech, religion, and press.&lt;ref name=Peterson_2002_p40&gt;[[#Peterson2002|Peterson (2002)]], p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; He said that a free and democratic government was "the strongest government on earth."&lt;ref name=Peterson_2002_p40/&gt; He nominated moderate Republicans to his cabinet: James Madison as Secretary of State, [[Henry Dearborn]] as Secretary of War, [[Levi Lincoln Sr.|Levi Lincoln]] as Attorney General, and [[Robert Smith (Cabinet member)|Robert Smith]] as Secretary of the Navy.&lt;ref name=Peterson41/&gt;

Upon assuming office, he first confronted an $83 million national debt.&lt;ref name=Meacham387/&gt; He began dismantling Hamilton's Federalist fiscal system with help from Secretary of Treasury [[Albert Gallatin]].&lt;ref name=Peterson41&gt;[[#Peterson2002|Peterson, 2002]], p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; Jefferson's administration eliminated the whiskey excise and other taxes after closing "unnecessary offices" and cutting "useless establishments and expenses".&lt;ref name="Wood, 2010, p. 293"&gt;[[#Wood2010|Wood, 2010]], p. 293.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bailey2007|Bailey, 2007]], p. 216.&lt;/ref&gt; They attempted to disassemble the national bank and its effect of increasing national debt, but were dissuaded by Gallatin.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Wills02|Wills, 2002]], pp. 50–51.&lt;/ref&gt; Jefferson shrank the Navy, deeming it unnecessary in peacetime.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Chernow04|Chernow, 2004]], p. 671.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, he incorporated a fleet of inexpensive gunboats used only for defense with the idea that they would not provoke foreign hostilities.&lt;ref name="Wood, 2010, p. 293"/&gt; After two terms, he had lowered the national debt from $83 million to $57 million.&lt;ref name=Meacham387&gt;[[#Meacham|Meacham, 2012]], p. 387.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jefferson pardoned several of those imprisoned under the Alien and Sedition Acts.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Meacham|Meacham, 2012]], p. 357.&lt;/ref&gt; Congressional Republicans repealed the [[Midnight Judges Act|Judiciary Act of 1801]], which removed nearly all of Adams's "midnight judges" from office. A subsequent appointment battle led to the Supreme Court's landmark decision in ''[[Marbury v. Madison]]'', asserting judicial review over executive branch actions.&lt;ref name="Meacham, 2012, p. 413"&gt;[[#Meacham|Meacham, 2012]], p. 375.&lt;/ref&gt; Jefferson appointed three [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court justices]]: [[William Johnson (judge)|William Johnson]] (1804), [[Henry Brockholst Livingston]] (1807), and [[Thomas Todd]] (1807).&lt;ref&gt;[[#Urofsky|Urofsky, 2006]], p. viii.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jefferson strongly felt the need for a national military university, producing an officer engineering corps for a national defense based on the advancement of the sciences, rather than having to rely on foreign sources for top grade engineers with questionable loyalty.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Scythes1|Scythes, 2014]], pp. 693–94.&lt;/ref&gt; He signed the [[Military Peace Establishment Act]] on March 16, 1802, thus founding the [[United States Military Academy]] at West Point. The Act documented in 29 sections a new set of laws and limits for the military. Jefferson was also hoping to bring reform to the Executive branch, replacing Federalists and active opponents throughout the officer corps to promote Republican values.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Scythes1|Scythes, 2014]], pp. 422–23.&lt;/ref&gt;

===First Barbary War===
{{Main|First Barbary War}}
[[File:1800 map Afrique by Arrowsmith BPL 15210 detail2.jpg|thumb|upright=1.65|alt=Map. Barbary Coast of North Africa 1806|Barbary Coast of North Africa 1806. Left is Morocco at Gibraltar, center is Tunis, and right is Tripoli.]]

American merchant ships had been protected from [[Barbary Coast]] pirates by the [[Royal Navy]] when the states were British colonies.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Fremont-Barnes|Fremont-Barnes, 2006]], p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; After independence, however, pirates often captured U.S. merchant ships, pillaged cargoes, and enslaved or held crew members for ransom. Jefferson had opposed paying tribute to the Barbary States since 1785.&lt;ref name=Barnes36&gt;[[#Fremont-Barnes|Fremont-Barnes, 2006]], p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;
In March 1786, he and John Adams went to London to negotiate with Tripoli's envoy, ambassador Sidi Haji Abdrahaman (or Sidi Haji Abdul Rahman Adja).&lt;ref&gt;[[First Barbary War]]&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1801, he authorized a U.S. Navy fleet under Commodore [[Richard Dale]] to make a show of force in the Mediterranean, the first American naval squadron to cross the Atlantic.&lt;ref name="Meacham pp. 364"&gt;[[#Meacham|Meacham, 2012]], pp. 364–65.&lt;/ref&gt; Following the fleet's first engagement, he successfully asked Congress for a declaration of war.&lt;ref name="Meacham pp. 364"/&gt; The subsequent "First Barbary War" was the first foreign war fought by the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Herring|Herring, 2008]], p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pasha]] of [[Tripoli]] [[Yusuf Karamanli]] captured the {{USS|Philadelphia|1799|6}}, so Jefferson authorized [[William Eaton (soldier)|William Eaton]], the U.S. Consul to [[Tunis]], to lead a force to restore the pasha's older brother to the throne.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Wood2010|Wood, 2010]], p. 638.&lt;/ref&gt; The American navy forced Tunis and [[Algiers]] into breaking their alliance with Tripoli. Jefferson ordered five separate naval bombardments of Tripoli, leading the pasha to sign a treaty that restored peace in the Mediterranean.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bernstein03|Bernstein. 2003]], p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt; This victory proved only temporary, but according to Wood, "many Americans celebrated it as a vindication of their policy of spreading free trade around the world and as a great victory for liberty over tyranny."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Wood2010|Wood, 2010]], p. 639.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Louisiana Purchase===
{{Main|Louisiana Purchase}}
[[File:Louisiana Purchase.png|thumb|right|upright=1.65|The 1803 Louisiana Purchase totaled {{convert|827,987|lk=in|sqmi|km2|abbr=off|sp=us}}, doubling the size of the United States.]]

Spain [[Third Treaty of San Ildefonso|ceded ownership]] of the Louisiana territory in 1800 to the more predominant France. Jefferson was greatly concerned that [[Napoleon]]'s broad interests in the vast territory would threaten the security of the continent and [[Mississippi River]] shipping. He wrote that the cession "works most sorely on the U.S. It completely reverses all the political relations of the U.S."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Meacham|Meacham, 2012]], pp. 383–84.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1802, he instructed [[James Monroe]] and [[Robert R. Livingston (chancellor)|Robert R. Livingston]] to negotiate with Napoleon to purchase [[New Orleans]] and adjacent coastal areas from France.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Wood2010|Wood, 2010]], p. 368.&lt;/ref&gt; In early 1803, Jefferson offered Napoleon nearly $10 million for {{convert|40,000|sqmi|abbr=off|sp=us}} of tropical territory.&lt;ref name=Freehling2005&gt;[[#Freehling05|Freehling, 2005]], p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt;

Napoleon realized that French military control was impractical over such a vast remote territory, and he was in dire need of funds for his [[The United Kingdom in the Napoleonic Wars|wars on the home front]]. In early April 1803, he unexpectedly made negotiators a counter-offer to sell {{convert|827,987|sqmi|abbr=off|sp=us}} of French territory for $15 million, doubling the size of the United States.&lt;ref name=Freehling2005/&gt; U.S. negotiators seized this unique opportunity and accepted the offer and signed the treaty on April 30, 1803.&lt;ref name="Meacham387"/&gt; Word of the unexpected purchase didn't reach Jefferson until July 3, 1803.&lt;ref name="Meacham387"/&gt; He unknowingly acquired the most fertile tract of land of its size on Earth, making the new country self-sufficient in food and other resources. The sale also significantly curtailed British and French imperial ambitions in North America, removing obstacles to U.S. westward expansion.&lt;ref name=Ellis208&gt;[[#Ellis2008|Ellis, 2008]], pp. 207–08.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most thought that this was an exceptional opportunity, despite Republican reservations about the Constitutional authority of the federal government to acquire land.&lt;ref name="The Rise of American Democracy"&gt;[[#Wilentz|Wilentz, 2005]], p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt; Jefferson initially thought that a Constitutional [[History of the United States Constitution#Senate changes|amendment]] was necessary to purchase and govern the new territory; but he later changed his mind, fearing that this would give cause to oppose the purchase, and he therefore urged a speedy debate and ratification.&lt;ref&gt;Meecham, 2012, pp. 389–90.&lt;/ref&gt; On October 20, 1803, the Senate ratified the purchase treaty by a vote of 24–7.&lt;ref&gt;Tucker, 1837, v. 2, pp. 152–54.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the purchase, Jefferson preserved the region's Spanish legal code and instituted a gradual approach for integrating settlers into American democracy. He believed that a period of federal rule would be necessary while Louisianians adjusted to their new nation.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Peterson70|Peterson, 1970]], p. 777; [[#Wood2010|Wood, 2010]], p. 372; [[#Ellis2008|Ellis, 2008]], p. 230.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|Louisiana nevertheless gained statehood nine years later in 1812.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Wood2010|Wood, 2010]], p. 373.&lt;/ref&gt;}} Historians have differed in their assessments regarding the constitutional implications of the sale,&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, 2008, pp. 231–32.&lt;/ref&gt; but they typically hail the Louisiana acquisition as a major accomplishment. [[Frederick Jackson Turner]] called the purchase the most formative event in American history.&lt;ref name="Ellis208"/&gt;

===Lewis and Clark expedition===
{{Main|Lewis and Clark Expedition|Red River Expedition (1806)|Pike expedition}}
[[File:Lewis and clark-expedition.jpg|thumb|alt=Corps of Discover on river boat October 1805|Corps of Discovery, October 1805]]

Jefferson anticipated further westward settlements due to the Louisiana Purchase and arranged for the exploration and mapping of the uncharted territory. He sought to establish a U.S. claim ahead of competing European interests and to find the rumored [[Northwest Passage]].&lt;ref name="Ambrose76"&gt;[[#Ambrose|Ambrose, 1996]], pp. 76, 418.&lt;/ref&gt; Jefferson and others were influenced by exploration accounts of [[Antoine-Simon Le Page du Pratz|Le Page du Pratz]] in Louisiana (1763) and Captain [[James Cook]] in the Pacific (1784),&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ambrose|Ambrose, 1996]], p. 154.&lt;/ref&gt; and they persuaded Congress in 1804 to fund an expedition to explore and [[:File:Lewis and Clark Expidition Map.jpg|map]] the newly acquired territory to the Pacific Ocean.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Rodriguez|Rodriguez, 2002]], pp. xxiv, 162, 185.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jefferson appointed [[Meriwether Lewis]] and [[William Clark]] to be leaders of the [[Corps of Discovery]] (1803–1806).&lt;ref&gt;[[#Rodriguez|Rodriguez, 2002]], pp. 112, 186.&lt;/ref&gt; In the months leading up to the expedition, Jefferson tutored Lewis in the sciences of mapping, botany, natural history, mineralogy, and astronomy and navigation, giving him unlimited access to his library at Monticello, which included the largest collection of books in the world on the subject of the geography and natural history of the North American continent, along with an impressive collection of maps.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ambrose|Ambrose, 1996]], pp. 54, 80.&lt;/ref&gt;

The expedition lasted from May 1804 to September 1806 [[:template:Timeline of the Lewis and Clark Expedition|(see Timeline)]] and obtained a wealth of scientific and geographic knowledge, including knowledge of many Indian tribes.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ambrose|Ambrose, 1996]], pp. 154, 409, 512.&lt;/ref&gt;
;&lt;big&gt;Other expeditions&lt;/big&gt;
{{Main|Red River Expedition (1806)|Pike expedition}}
In addition to the Corps of Discovery, Jefferson organized three other western expeditions: the [[William Dunbar (explorer)|William Dunbar]] and George Hunter expedition on the [[Ouachita River]] (1804–1805), the [[Red River Expedition (1806)|Thomas Freeman and Peter Custis expedition]] (1806) on the [[Red River of the South|Red River]], and the [[Pike expedition|Zebulon Pike expedition]] (1806–1807) into the Rocky Mountains and the Southwest. All three produced valuable information about the American frontier.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Berry|Berry, 2006]], p. xi.&lt;/ref&gt;

===American Indian policies===
{{Main|Thomas Jefferson and Native Americans}}
[[File:Black Hoof.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|right|Black Hoof, leader of the Shawnee, accepted Jefferson's Indian assimilation policies.]]

Jefferson's experiences with the American Indians began during his boyhood in Virginia and extended through his political career and into his retirement. He refuted the contemporary notion that Indians were an inferior people and maintained that they were equal in body and mind to people of European descent.&lt;ref&gt;[[#TJF:Indians|TJF: American Indians]]&lt;/ref&gt;

As governor of Virginia during the Revolutionary War, Jefferson recommended moving the [[Cherokee]] and [[Shawnee]] tribes, who had allied with the British, to west of the Mississippi River. But when he took office as president, he quickly took measures to avert another major conflict, as American and Indian societies were in collision and the British were inciting Indian tribes from Canada.&lt;ref name="Miller2008"&gt;[[Thomas Jefferson#Miller08|Miller, 2008]], p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sheehan1974&gt;[[#Sheehan74|Sheehan, 1974]], pp. 120–21.&lt;/ref&gt; In Georgia, he stipulated that the state would release its legal claims for lands to its west in exchange for military support in expelling the Cherokee from Georgia. This facilitated his policy of western expansion, to "advance compactly as we multiply".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Peterson70|Peterson, 1970]], ch. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

In keeping with his [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] thinking, President Jefferson adopted an assimilation policy towards American Indians known as his "civilization program" which included securing peaceful U.S. '''–''' Indian treaty alliances and encouraging agriculture. Jefferson advocated that Indian tribes should make federal purchases by credit holding their lands as collateral for repayment. Various tribes accepted Jefferson's policies, including the Shawnees led by [[Black Hoof]], the Creek, and the Cherokees. However, some Shawnees broke off from Black Hoof, led by [[Tecumseh]], and opposed Jefferson's assimilation policies.&lt;ref&gt;[[#TJFIndian Nations|TJF: President Jefferson and the Indian Nations]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian Bernard Sheehan argues that Jefferson believed that assimilation was best for American Indians; second best was removal to the west. He felt that the worst outcome of the cultural and resources conflict between American citizens and American Indians would be their attacking the whites.&lt;ref name=Sheehan1974/&gt; Jefferson told Secretary of War General [[Henry Dearborn]] (Indian affairs were then under the War Department), "If we are constrained to lift the hatchet against any tribe, we will never lay it down until that tribe is exterminated or driven beyond the Mississippi."&lt;ref&gt;[[#morals|The Life and Writings of Thomas Jefferson]], pp. 265–66.&lt;/ref&gt; Miller agrees that Jefferson believed that Indians should assimilate to American customs and agriculture. Historians such as [[Peter S. Onuf]] and Merrill D. Peterson argue that Jefferson's actual Indian policies did little to promote assimilation and were a pretext to seize lands.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Miller08|Miller, 2008]], p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Re-election in 1804 and second term===
{{further|United States presidential election, 1804}}
[[File:ElectoralCollege1804.svg|thumb|right|alt=Electoral College map|1804 Electoral College vote]]
Jefferson's successful first term occasioned his re-nomination for president by the Republican party, with [[George Clinton (vice president)|George Clinton]] replacing Burr as his running mate.&lt;ref name=Meacham405&gt;[[#Meacham|Meacham, 2012]], pp. 405–06.&lt;/ref&gt; The Federalist party ran [[Charles Cotesworth Pinckney]] of South Carolina, John Adams's vice presidential candidate in the 1800 election. The Jefferson-Clinton ticket won overwhelmingly in the electoral college vote, by 162 to 14, promoting their achievement of a strong economy, lower taxes, and the Louisiana Purchase.&lt;ref name=Meacham405/&gt;

In March 1806, a split developed in the Republican party, led by fellow Virginian and former Republican ally [[John Randolph of Roanoke|John Randolph]] who viciously accused President Jefferson on the floor of the House of moving too far in the Federalist direction. In so doing, Randolph permanently set himself apart [[Tertium quids|politically]] from Jefferson. Jefferson and Madison had backed resolutions to limit or ban British imports in retaliation for British actions against American shipping. Also, in 1808, Jefferson was the first president to propose a broad Federal plan to build roads and canals across several states, asking for $20 million, further alarming Randolph and believers of limited government.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Meacham|Meacham, 2012]], pp. 415–17.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jefferson's popularity further suffered in his second term due to his response to wars in Europe. Positive relations with Great Britain had diminished, due partly to the antipathy between Jefferson and British diplomat [[Anthony Merry]]. After Napoleon's decisive victory at the [[Battle of Austerlitz]] in 1805, Napoleon became more aggressive in his negotiations over trading rights, which American efforts failed to counter. Jefferson then led the enactment of the [[Embargo Act of 1807]], directed at both France and Great Britain. This triggered economic chaos in the U.S. and was strongly criticized at the time, resulting in Jefferson having to abandon the policy a year later.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Tucker37|Tucker, 1837]], v. 2, pp. 291–94.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the revolutionary era, the states abolished the international slave trade, but South Carolina reopened it. In his annual message of December 1806, Jefferson denounced the "violations of human rights" attending the international slave trade, calling on the newly elected Congress to criminalize it immediately. In 1807, Congress passed the [[Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves]], which Jefferson signed.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Miller80|Miller, 1980]], pp. 145–46.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Randal583"&gt;[[#Randall|Randall, 1994]], p. 583.&lt;/ref&gt; The act established severe punishment against the international slave trade, although it did not address the issue domestically.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kaplan|Kaplan, 1999]], p. 407.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the wake of the Louisiana Purchase, Jefferson sought to annex Florida from Spain, as brokered by Napoleon.&lt;ref name=Peterson2002p49&gt;[[#Peterson2002|Peterson, 2002]], p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; Congress agreed to the President's request to secretly appropriate purchase money in the "$2,000,000 Bill".&lt;ref name=Peterson2002p49/&gt; The Congressional funding drew criticism from Randolph, who believed that the money would wind up in the coffers of Napoleon. The bill was signed into law; however, negotiations for the project failed. Jefferson lost clout among fellow Republicans, and his use of unofficial Congressional channels was sharply criticized.&lt;ref name=Peterson2002p49/&gt; In Haiti, Jefferson's neutrality had allowed arms to enable the slave independence movement during its [[Haitian Revolution|Revolution]], and blocked attempts to assist Napoleon, who was defeated there in 1803.&lt;ref name=jstorhaiti&gt;[[#JeffHaiti|Jefferson, Haiti ''The Journal of Southern History'' 61, no. 2 (May 1995)]], p. 221.&lt;/ref&gt; But he refused official recognition of the country during his second term, in deference to southern complaints about the racial violence against slave-holders; it was eventually extended to Haiti in 1862.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bernstein03|Bernstein, 2003]], pp. 146–47.&lt;/ref&gt; Domestically, Jefferson's grandson James Madison Randolph became the first child born in the White House in 1806.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Malone81|Malone, 1981]], p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Burr conspiracy and trial===
{{further|Burr–Hamilton duel|Burr conspiracy}}
[[File:Vanderlyn Burr.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|left|Aaron Burr&lt;br /&gt;Vanderlyn, 1802]]
Following the 1801 electoral deadlock, Jefferson's relationship rapidly eroded with his vice president, former New York Senator [[Aaron Burr]]. Jefferson suspected Burr of seeking the presidency for himself, while Burr was angered by Jefferson's refusal to appoint some of his supporters to federal office. Burr was dropped from the Republican ticket in 1804.

The same year, Burr was soundly defeated in his bid to be elected New York governor. During the campaign, [[Alexander Hamilton]] publicly made callous remarks regarding Burr's moral character.&lt;ref name=Chernow04_p714&gt;[[#Chernow04|Chernow, 2004, p. 714]].&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, Burr challenged Hamilton to a duel, mortally wounding and killing Hamilton on July 11, 1804. Burr was indicted for Hamilton's murder in New York and New Jersey, causing him to flee to Georgia, although he remained President of the Senate during Supreme Court Justice [[Samuel Chase]]'s impeachment trial.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Wood2010|Wood, 2010]], pp. 385–86.&lt;/ref&gt; Both indictments quietly died and Burr was not prosecuted.&lt;ref name=Banner_1974_p34&gt;[[#Banner 1974|Banner (1974)]], p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; Also during the election, certain New England separatists approached Burr, desiring a New England federation and intimating that he would be their leader.&lt;ref name=Banner_1974_pp34-35&gt;[[#Banner 1974|Banner (1974)]], pp. 34–35.&lt;/ref&gt; However, nothing came of the plot, since Burr had lost the election and his reputation was ruined after killing Hamilton.&lt;ref name=Banner_1974_pp34-35/&gt; In August 1804, Burr contacted British Minister [[Anthony Merry]] offering to capture U.S. western territory in return for money and British ships.&lt;ref name="The Burr Conspiracy 2000"&gt;[[#TBC 2000|The Burr Conspiracy (2000)]]&lt;/ref&gt;

After leaving office in April 1805, Burr traveled west and conspired with Louisiana Territory governor [[James Wilkinson]], beginning a large-scale recruitment for a military expedition.&lt;ref name=Peterson_2002_p50&gt;[[#Peterson2002|Peterson (2002)]], p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; Other plotters included Ohio Senator [[John Smith (Ohio Senator)|John Smith]] and an Irishman named [[Harman Blennerhassett|Harmon Blennerhassett]].&lt;ref name=Peterson_2002_p50/&gt; Burr discussed a number of plots—seizing control of Mexico or Spanish Florida, or forming a secessionist state in New Orleans or the Western U.S. Historians remain unclear as to his true goal.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Wood2010|Wood, 2010]], pp. 385–86; [[#Meacham|Meacham, 2012]], pp. 420, 422.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|Further complicating matters, Wilkinson was posthumously revealed to have been in the simultaneous pay of the British, French, and Spanish.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bernstein03|Bernstein, 2003]], pp. 161–62.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the fall of 1806, Burr launched a military flotilla carrying about 60 men down the [[Ohio River]]. Wilkinson renounced the plot, apparently from self-interested motives; he reported Burr's expedition to Jefferson, who immediately ordered Burr's arrest.&lt;ref name=Peterson_2002_p50/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Meacham|Meacham, 2012]], p. 420.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Banner_1974_p37&gt;[[#Banner 1974|Banner (1974)]], p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; On February 13, 1807, Burr was captured in Louisiana's Bayou Pierre wilderness and sent to Virginia to be tried for treason.&lt;ref name="The Burr Conspiracy 2000"/&gt;

Burr's 1807 conspiracy trial became a national issue.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Appleby|Appleby, 2003]], p. 100; [[#Bernstein03|Bernstein, 2003]], p. 162.&lt;/ref&gt; Jefferson attempted to preemptively influence the verdict by telling Congress that Burr's guilt was "beyond question", but the case came before his longtime political foe [[John Marshall]], who dismissed the treason charge. Burr's legal team at one stage subpoenaed Jefferson, but Jefferson refused to testify, making the first argument for [[executive privilege]]. Instead, Jefferson provided relevant legal documents.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bernstein03|Bernstein, 2003]], pp. 163–64; [[#Meacham|Meacham, 2012]], pp. 422–23.&lt;/ref&gt; After a three-month trial, the jury found Burr not guilty, while Jefferson denounced his acquittal.&lt;ref name=Banner37&gt;[[#Banner 1974|Banner, 1974]], p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bernstein03|Bernstein, 2003]], p. 165.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|Burr then left for Europe and eventually returned to practicing law.}}&lt;ref&gt;[[#Appleby|Appleby, 2003]], p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt; Jefferson subsequently removed Wilkinson as territorial governor but retained him in the U.S. military. Historian James N. Banner criticized Jefferson for continuing to trust Wilkinson, a "faithless plotter".&lt;ref name=Banner_1974_p37/&gt;

===''Chesapeake''–''Leopard'' affair and Embargo Act===
{{Main|Chesapeake–Leopard affair}}
[[File:Leopardchesapeake.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|right|HMS ''Leopard'' (right) firing upon USS ''Chesapeake'']]

The British conducted raids on American shipping and kidnapped seamen in 1806–07; thousands of Americans were thus [[Impressment|impressed]] into the British naval service. In 1806, Jefferson issued a call for a boycott of British goods; on April 18, Congress passed the Non-Importation Acts, but they were never enforced. Later that year, Jefferson asked James Monroe and [[William Pinkney]] to negotiate with Great Britain to end the harassment of American shipping, though Britain showed no signs of improving relations. The [[Monroe–Pinkney Treaty]] was finalized but lacked any provisions to end impressment, and Jefferson refused to submit it to the Senate for ratification.&lt;ref name=Hayes505&gt;[[#Hayes|Hayes, 2008]], pp. 504–05.&lt;/ref&gt;

The British ship {{HMS|Leopard|1790|6}} fired upon the {{USS|Chesapeake|1799|6}} off the Virginia coast in June 1807, and Jefferson prepared for war.&lt;ref name=embargo&gt;[[#TJFEmbargo|TJF: Embargo of 1807]]&lt;/ref&gt; He issued a proclamation banning armed British ships from U.S. waters. He presumed unilateral authority to call on the states to prepare 100,000 militia and ordered the purchase of arms, ammunition, and supplies, writing, "The laws of necessity, of self-preservation, of saving our country when in danger, are of higher obligation [than strict observance of written laws]". The {{USS|Revenge|1806|6}} was dispatched to demand an explanation from the British government; it also was fired upon. Jefferson called for a special session of Congress in October to enact an embargo or alternatively to consider war.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Meacham|Meacham, 2012]], pp. 425–29.&lt;/ref&gt;

In December, news arrived that Napoleon had extended the [[Berlin Decree]], globally banning British imports. In Britain, [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]] ordered redoubling efforts at impressment, including American sailors. But the war fever of the summer faded; Congress had no appetite to prepare the U.S. for war. Jefferson asked for and received the Embargo Act, an alternative that allowed the U.S. more time to build up defensive works, militias, and naval forces. Later historians have seen irony in Jefferson's assertion of such federal power. Meacham claims that the Embargo Act was a projection of power which surpassed the Alien and Sedition Acts, and R. B. Bernstein writes that Jefferson "was pursuing policies resembling those he had cited in 1776 as grounds for independence and revolution".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Meacham|Meacham, 2012]], p. 430; [[#Bernstein03|Bernstein, 2003]], p. 168.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ograbme.jpg|thumb|alt=A turtle biting a man carrying a barrel to a waiting ship|A political cartoon showing merchants dodging the "Ograbme", which is "Embargo" spelled backwards (1807)]]

Secretary of State James Madison supported the embargo with equal vigor to Jefferson,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Burstein10|Burstein, 2010]], pp. 497–98.&lt;/ref&gt; while Treasury Secretary Gallatin opposed it, due to its indefinite time frame and the risk that it posed to the policy of American neutrality.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Meacham|Meacham, 2012]], p. 430.&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. economy suffered, criticism grew, and opponents began evading the embargo. Instead of retreating, Jefferson sent federal agents to secretly track down smugglers and violators.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Tucker90|Tucker, 1990]], v. 1, pp. 204–09, 232.&lt;/ref&gt; Three acts were passed in Congress during 1807 and 1808, called the ''Supplementary'', the ''Additional'', and the ''Enforcement'' acts.&lt;ref name=embargo/&gt; The government could not prevent American vessels from trading with the European belligerents once they had left American ports, although the embargo triggered a devastating decline in exports.&lt;ref name=embargo/&gt;

Most historians consider Jefferson's embargo to have been ineffective and harmful to American interests.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Cogliano|Cogliano, 2008]], p. 250; [[#Meacham|Meacham, 2012]], p. 475.&lt;/ref&gt; Appleby describes the strategy as Jefferson's "least effective policy", and Joseph Ellis calls it "an unadulterated calamity".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Appleby|Appleby, 2003]], p. 145; [[#Ellis|Ellis, 1996]], p. 237.&lt;/ref&gt; Others, however, portray it as an innovative, nonviolent measure which aided France in its war with Britain while preserving American neutrality.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hayes|Hayes, 2008]], pp. 504–05; [[#Kaplan|Kaplan, 1999]], pp. 166–68.&lt;/ref&gt; Jefferson believed that the failure of the embargo was due to selfish traders and merchants showing a lack of "republican virtue." He maintained that, had the embargo been widely observed, it would have avoided war in 1812.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hayes|Hayes, 2008]], pp. 504–05; [[#Peterson60|Peterson, 1960]], pp. 289–90.&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1807, Jefferson announced his intention not to seek a third term. He turned his attention increasingly to Monticello during the last year of his presidency, giving Madison and Gallatin almost total control of affairs.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ellis96|Ellis, 1996]], p. 238; [[#Appleby|Appleby, 2003]], pp. 128–29.&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly before leaving office in March 1809, Jefferson signed the repeal of the Embargo. In its place, the [[Non-Intercourse Act]] was passed, but it proved no more effective.&lt;ref name=embargo/&gt; The day before Madison was inaugurated as his successor, Jefferson said that he felt like "a prisoner, released from his chains".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ellis96|Ellis, 1996]], p. 238.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-presidency (1809–1826)==
{{further|Thomas Jefferson and education}}
Following his retirement from the presidency, Jefferson continued his pursuit of educational interests; he sold his vast collection of books to the Library of Congress, and founded and built the University of Virginia.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Tucker37|Tucker, 1837]], v. 2, p. 479.&lt;/ref&gt; Jefferson continued to correspond with many of the country's leaders, and the [[Monroe Doctrine]] bears a strong resemblance to solicited advice that Jefferson gave to Monroe in 1823.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Meacham|Meacham, 2012]], pp. 481–82.&lt;/ref&gt; As he settled into private life at Monticello, Jefferson developed a daily routine of rising early. He would spend several hours writing letters, with which he was often deluged. In the midday, he would often inspect the plantation on horseback. In the evenings, his family enjoyed leisure time in the gardens; late at night, Jefferson would retire to bed with a book.&lt;ref&gt;[[#TJFRise|TJF: I Rise with the Sun]]&lt;/ref&gt; However, his routine was often interrupted by uninvited visitors and tourists eager to see the icon in his final days, turning Monticello into "a virtual hotel".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ellis96|Ellis, 1996]], p. 232; [[#Meacham|Meacham, 2012]], pp. 463–65.&lt;/ref&gt;

===University of Virginia===
{{Main|University of Virginia}}
[[File:Lawn UVa colorful winter sun 2010.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|The University of Virginia, Jefferson's "Academical Village"]]

Jefferson envisioned a university free of church influences where students could specialize in many new areas not offered at other colleges. He believed that education engendered a stable society, which should provide publicly funded schools accessible to students from all social strata, based solely on ability.&lt;ref&gt;[[#UVALibrary|U Va. Library]]&lt;/ref&gt; He initially proposed his University in a letter to [[Joseph Priestley]] in 1800&lt;ref&gt;[[#Adams88|Adams, 1888]], p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; and, in 1819, the 76-year-old Jefferson founded the University of Virginia. He organized the state legislative campaign for its charter and, with the assistance of [[Edmund Bacon (1785–1866)|Edmund Bacon]], purchased the location. He was the principal designer of the buildings, planned the university's curriculum, and served as the first rector upon its opening in 1825.&lt;ref name="Peterson 1970 ch11"&gt;[[#Peterson70|Peterson, 1970]], ch. 11 [e-book].&lt;/ref&gt;

Jefferson was a strong disciple of Greek and Roman architectural styles, which he believed to be most representative of American democracy. Each academic unit, called a pavilion, was designed with a two-story temple front, while the library "Rotunda" was modeled on the [[Pantheon, Rome|Roman Pantheon]]. Jefferson referred to the university's grounds as the "[[The Lawn|Academical Village]]," and he reflected his educational ideas in its layout. The ten pavilions included classrooms and faculty residences; they formed a quadrangle and were connected by colonnades, behind which stood the students' rows of rooms. Gardens and vegetable plots were placed behind the pavilions and were surrounded by [[Crinkle crankle wall|serpentine walls]], affirming the importance of the agrarian lifestyle.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hogan87|Hogan, 1987]], pp. 28–29.&lt;/ref&gt; The university had a library rather than a church at its center, emphasizing its secular nature—a controversial aspect at the time.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Gordon08|Gordon-Reed, 2008]], p. 649.&lt;/ref&gt;

When Jefferson died in 1826, James Madison replaced him as rector.&lt;ref&gt;[[#TJFMadison|TJF: James Madison]]&lt;/ref&gt; Jefferson bequeathed most of his library to the university.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Crawford2008|Crawford, 2008]], p. 235.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reconciliation with Adams===
[[File:Abigail Adams by Gilbert Stuart.jpg|thumb|In 1804, Abigail Adams attempted to reconcile Jefferson and Adams.]]

Jefferson and John Adams had been good friends in the first decades of their political careers, serving together in the Continental Congress in the 1770s and in Europe in the 1780s. The Federalist/Republican split of the 1790s divided them, however, and Adams felt betrayed by Jefferson's sponsorship of partisan attacks, such as those of James Callender. Jefferson, on the other hand, was angered at Adams for his appointment of "midnight judges".&lt;ref name=Freeman2008&gt;[[#Freeman1|Freeman, 2008]], p.  12.&lt;/ref&gt; The two men did not communicate directly for more than a decade after Jefferson succeeded Adams as president.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ellis03|Ellis, 2003]], pp. 207, 209.&lt;/ref&gt; A brief correspondence took place between [[Abigail Adams]] and Jefferson after Jefferson's daughter "Polly" died in 1804, in an attempt at reconciliation unknown to Adams. However, an exchange of letters resumed open hostilities between Adams and Jefferson.&lt;ref name=Freeman2008/&gt;

As early as 1809, [[Benjamin Rush]], signer of the Declaration of Independence, desired that Jefferson and Adams reconcile and began to prod the two through correspondence to re-establish contact.&lt;ref name=Freeman2008/&gt; In 1812, Adams wrote a short New Year's greeting to Jefferson, prompted earlier by Rush, to which Jefferson warmly responded. Thus began what historian [[David McCullough]] calls "one of the most extraordinary correspondences in American history".&lt;ref&gt;[[#McCullough|McCullough, 2001]], pp. 603–05.&lt;/ref&gt; Over the next fourteen years, the former presidents exchanged 158 letters discussing their political differences, justifying their respective roles in events, and debating the revolution's import to the world.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ellis03|Ellis, 2003]], pp. 213, 230.&lt;/ref&gt; When Adams died, his last words included an acknowledgement of his longtime friend and rival: "Thomas Jefferson survives", unaware that Jefferson had died several hours before.&lt;ref&gt;[[#McCullough|McCullough, 2001]], p. 646.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ellis03|Ellis, 2003]], p. 248.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Autobiography===
In 1821, at the age of 77 Jefferson began writing his autobiography, in order to "state some recollections of dates and facts concerning myself".&lt;ref name=Jeffbio&gt;[[#Bio|Autobiography of Thomas Jefferson, 1743–1790]]&lt;/ref&gt; He focused on the struggles and achievements he experienced until July 29, 1790, where the narrative stopped short.*&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bernstein03|Berstein, 2003]], p. 179.&lt;/ref&gt; He excluded his youth, emphasizing the revolutionary era. He related that his ancestors came from Wales to America in the early 17th century and settled in the western frontier of the Virginia colony, which influenced his zeal for individual and state rights. Jefferson described his father as uneducated, but with a "strong mind and sound judgement". His enrollment in the College of William and Mary and election to the Continental Congress in Philadelphia in 1775 were included.&lt;ref name=Jeffbio/&gt;

He also expressed opposition to the idea of a privileged [[aristocracy]] made up of large land owning families partial to the King, and instead promoted "the aristocracy of virtue and talent, which nature has wisely provided for the direction of the interests of society, &amp; scattered with equal hand through all it's conditions, was deemed essential to a well ordered republic".&lt;ref name=Jeffbio/&gt;

Jefferson gave his insight about people, politics, and events.&lt;ref name=Jeffbio/&gt; The work is primarily concerned with the Declaration and reforming the government of Virginia. He used notes, letters, and documents to tell many of the stories within the autobiography. He suggested that this history was so rich that his personal affairs were better overlooked, but he incorporated a self-analysis using the Declaration and other patriotism.&lt;ref&gt;[[#self|Hamelman, 2002, Journal]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lafayette's visit===
{{Main|Visit of the Marquis de Lafayette to the United States}}
[[File:Lafayette-scheffer.jpg|thumb|upright|Lafayette in 1824, portrait by Scheffer, hanging in U.S. House of Representatives]]

In the summer of 1824, the [[Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette|Marquis de Lafayette]] accepted an invitation from President James Monroe to visit the country. Jefferson and Lafayette had not seen each other since 1789. After visits to [[New York (state)|New York]], [[New England]], and Washington, Lafayette arrived at Monticello on November 4.&lt;ref name="Peterson 1970 ch11"/&gt;

Jefferson's grandson [[Thomas Jefferson Randolph|Randolph]] was present and recorded the reunion: "As they approached each other, their uncertain gait quickened itself into a shuffling run, and exclaiming, 'Ah Jefferson!' 'Ah Lafayette!', they burst into tears as they fell into each other's arms." Jefferson and Lafayette then retired to the house to reminisce.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mapp|Mapp, 1991]], p. 328.&lt;/ref&gt; The next morning Jefferson, Lafayette, and James Madison attended a tour and banquet at the University of Virginia. Jefferson had someone else read a speech he had prepared for Lafayette, as his voice was weak and could not carry. This was his last public presentation. After an 11-day visit, Lafayette bid Jefferson goodbye and departed Monticello.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Malone81|Malone, 1981]], pp. 403–04; [[#Brodie|Brodie, 1998]], p. 460; [[#Crawford2008|Crawford, 2008]], pp. 202–03.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Final days, death, and burial===
[[File:Thomas Jefferson's Grave Site.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Jefferson's gravesite|alt=Obelisk at Thomas Jefferson's gravesite]]

Jefferson's approximately $100,000 of debt weighed heavily on his mind in his final months, as it became increasingly clear that he would have little to leave to his heirs. In February 1826, he successfully applied to the General Assembly to hold a public lottery as a fund raiser.&lt;ref name=Ellis288&gt;[[#Ellis96|Ellis, 1996]], pp. 287–88.&lt;/ref&gt; His health began to deteriorate in July 1825, due to a combination of rheumatism from arm and wrist injuries, as well as intestinal and urinary disorders&lt;ref name="Peterson 1970 ch11"/&gt; and, by June 1826, he was confined to bed.&lt;ref name=Ellis288/&gt; On July 3, Jefferson was overcome by fever and declined an invitation to Washington to attend an anniversary celebration of the Declaration.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Tucker37|Tucker, 1837]], v. 2, p. 551.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{anchor|Death}}
During the last hours of his life, he was accompanied by family members and friends. On July 4 at 12:50&amp;nbsp;p.m., Jefferson died at age 83 on the 50th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence, and just a few hours before the death of John Adams.&lt;ref name="rayner428–29"&gt;[[#Rayner34|Rayner, 1834]], pp. 428–29.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Berstein189&gt;[[#Bernstein03|Bernstein, 2003]], p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt; When Adams died, his last words included an acknowledgement of his longtime friend and rival: "Thomas Jefferson survives", though Adams was unaware that Jefferson had died several hours before.&lt;ref&gt;[[#McCullough|McCullough, 2001]], p. 646&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ellis03|Ellis, 2003]], p. 248&lt;/ref&gt; The sitting president was Adams's son [[John Quincy Adams|John Quincy]], and he called the coincidence of their deaths on the nation's anniversary "visible and palpable remarks of Divine Favor".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Meacham|Meacham, 2012]], p. 496.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after Jefferson had died, attendants found a gold locket on a chain around his neck, where it had rested for more than 40 years, containing a small faded blue ribbon which tied a lock of his wife Martha's brown hair.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Donaldson|Donaldson, 1898]], p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jefferson's remains were buried at Monticello, under a self-written epitaph:

&lt;blockquote&gt;HERE WAS BURIED THOMAS JEFFERSON, AUTHOR OF THE DECLARATION OF AMERICAN INDEPENDENCE, OF THE STATUTE OF VIRGINIA FOR RELIGIOUS FREEDOM, AND FATHER OF THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA.&lt;ref&gt;[[#TJFBio|Thomas Jefferson Foundation: "Thomas Jefferson, A Brief Biography"]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Jefferson died deeply in debt, unable to pass on his estate freely to his heirs.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bernstein03|Bernstein, 2003]], p. xii.&lt;/ref&gt; He gave instructions in his will for disposal of his assets,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Tucker37|Tucker, 1837]], v. 2, p. 556.&lt;/ref&gt; including the freeing of Sally Hemings's children;&lt;ref name="Meacham, 2012, p. 495"&gt;[[#Meacham|Meacham, 2012]], p. 495.&lt;/ref&gt; but his estate, possessions, and slaves were sold at public auctions starting in 1827.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ellis96|Ellis, 1996]], p. 289.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1831, Monticello was sold by [[Martha Jefferson Randolph]] and the other heirs.&lt;ref&gt;[[#TJFSale|Thomas Jefferson Foundation: "Sale of Monticello"]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political, social and religious views==

Jefferson subscribed to the political ideals expounded by [[John Locke]], [[Francis Bacon]], and [[Isaac Newton]], whom he considered the three greatest men who ever lived.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kayes|Hayes, 2008]], p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Cogliano|Cogliano, 2008]], p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; He was also influenced by the writings of [[Edward Gibbon|Gibbon]], [[David Hume|Hume]], [[William Robertson (historian)|Robertson]], [[Henry St John, 1st Viscount Bolingbroke|Bolingbroke]], [[Montesquieu]], and [[Voltaire]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Cogliano|Cogliano, 2008]], p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; Jefferson thought that the independent [[Yeoman#United States|yeoman]] and agrarian life were ideals of [[Republicanism in the United States|republican virtues]]. He distrusted cities and financiers, favored decentralized government power, and believed that the tyranny that had plagued the common man in Europe was due to corrupt political establishments and [[monarch]]ies. He supported efforts to disestablish the [[Church of England]]&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ferling2000|Ferling, 2000]], p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt; wrote the [[Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom]], and he pressed for a [[Separation of church and state in the United States|wall of separation]] between church and state.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mayer2|Mayer, 1994]], p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt; The Republicans under Jefferson were strongly influenced by the 18th-century British [[Whig (British political party)|Whig Party]], who believed in [[limited government]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Wood2010|Wood, 2010]], p. 287.&lt;/ref&gt; His [[Democratic-Republican Party]] became dominant in [[First Party System|early American politics]], and his views became known as [[Jeffersonian democracy]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Tucker37|Tucker, 1837]], v. 2, pp. 559–67.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Smith2003_p_314&gt;[[#Smith2003|Smith, 2003]], p. 314.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Society and government===

According to Jefferson's philosophy, citizens have "certain inalienable rights" and "rightful liberty is unobstructed action according to our will, within limits drawn around us by the equal rights of others".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bassani|Bassani, 2010]], p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt; A staunch advocate of the jury system to protect people's liberties, he proclaimed in 1801, "I consider [trial by jury] as the only anchor yet imagined by man, by which a government can be held to the principles of its constitution."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Wilson2012|Wilson, 2012]], p. 584.&lt;/ref&gt;
Jeffersonian government not only prohibited individuals in society from infringing on the liberty of others, but also restrained itself from diminishing individual liberty as a protection against [[Tyranny of the majority|tyranny from the majority]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mayer2|Mayer, 1994]], p. 328.&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, Jefferson favored restricted voting to those who could actually have free exercise of their reason by escaping any corrupting dependence on others. He advocated enfranchising a majority of Virginians, seeking to expand suffrage to include "yeoman farmers" who owned their own land while excluding tenant farmers, city day laborers, vagrants, most Amerindians, and women.&lt;ref name=Wood220/&gt;

He was convinced that individual liberties were the fruit of political equality, which were threatened by arbitrary government.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Peterson60|Peterson, 1960]], p. 340.&lt;/ref&gt; Excesses of democracy in his view were caused by institutional corruptions rather than human nature. He was less suspicious of a working democracy than many contemporaries.&lt;ref name=Wood220&gt;[[#Wood2011|Wood, 2011]], pp. 220–27.&lt;/ref&gt; As president, Jefferson feared that the [[Federalism in the United States|Federalist system]] enacted by Washington and Adams had encouraged corrupting patronage and dependence. He tried to restore a balance between the state and federal governments more nearly reflecting the [[Articles of Confederation]], seeking to reinforce state prerogatives where his party was in a majority.&lt;ref name=Wood220/&gt;

Jefferson was steeped in the [[Whigs (British political party)|British Whig]] tradition of the oppressed majority set against a repeatedly unresponsive court party in the Parliament. He justified small outbreaks of rebellion as necessary to get monarchial regimes to amend oppressive measures compromising popular liberties. In a republican regime ruled by the majority, he acknowledged "it will often be exercised when wrong".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Golden|Golden &amp; Golden, 2002]], p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt; But "the remedy is to set them right as to facts, pardon and pacify them".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Meacham|Meacham, 2012]], p. 213. The full letter to [[William Stephens Smith|William S. Smith]] can be seen [https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/jefferson/jefffed.html at the Library of Congress]&lt;/ref&gt; As Jefferson saw his party triumph in two terms of his presidency and launch into a third term under James Madison, his view of the U.S. as a continental republic and an "empire of liberty" grew more upbeat. On departing the presidency in 1809, he described America as "trusted with the destines of this solitary republic of the world, the only monument of human rights, and the sole depository of the sacred fire of freedom and self-government".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bober|Bober, 2008]], p. 264.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Democracy===
[[File:Jefferson Portrait West Point by Thomas Sully.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Thomas Jefferson|Thomas Jefferson at age 78. Portrait by [[Thomas Sully]] hanging at [[West Point]], commissioned by Faculty and Cadets, 1821.]]
Jefferson considered democracy to be the expression of society, and promoted national self-determination, cultural uniformity, and education of all males of the commonwealth.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Wood2010|Wood, 2010]], p. 277.&lt;/ref&gt; He supported public education and a free press as essential components of a democratic nation.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Appleby|Appleby, 2003]], pp. 57–58, 84.&lt;/ref&gt;

After resigning as Secretary of State in 1795, Jefferson focused on the electoral bases of the Republicans and Federalists. The "Republican" classification for which he advocated included "the entire body of landholders" everywhere and "the body of laborers" without land.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Meacham|Meacham, 2012]], p. 298.&lt;/ref&gt; Republicans united behind Jefferson as vice president, with the election of 1796 expanding democracy nationwide at grassroots levels.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Wilentz|Wilentz, 2005]], p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt; Jefferson promoted Republican candidates for local offices.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Meacham|Meacham, 2012]], p. 308.&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning with Jefferson's electioneering for the "revolution of 1800", his political efforts were based on egalitarian appeals.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Wilentz|Wilentz, 2005]], pp. 97–98.&lt;/ref&gt; In his later years, he referred to the 1800 election "as real a revolution in the principles of our government as that of '76 was in its form", one "not effected indeed by the sword&amp;nbsp;... but by the&amp;nbsp;... suffrage of the people."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Wilentz|Wilentz, 2005]], p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt; Voter participation grew during Jefferson's presidency, increasing to "unimaginable levels" compared to the Federalist Era, with turnout of about 67,000 in [[United States presidential election, 1800|1800]] rising to about 143,000 in [[United States presidential election, 1804|1804]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Wilentz|Wilentz, 2005]], p. 138.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the onset of the Revolution, Jefferson accepted [[William Blackstone]]'s argument that property ownership would sufficiently empower voters' independent judgement, but he sought to further expand suffrage by land distribution to the poor.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Keyssar|Keyssar, 2009]], p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; In the heat of the Revolutionary Era and afterward, several states expanded voter eligibility from landed gentry to all propertied male, tax-paying citizens with Jefferson's support.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ferling04|Ferling, 2004]], p. 286.&lt;/ref&gt; In retirement, he gradually became critical of his home state for violating "the principle of equal political rights"—the social right of universal male suffrage.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Keyssar|Keyssar, 2009]], p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; He sought a "general suffrage" of all taxpayers and militia-men, and equal representation by population in the General Assembly to correct preferential treatment of the slave-holding regions.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Wilentz|Wilentz, 2005]], p. 200.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religion===
{{Main|Religious views of Thomas Jefferson}}
[[File:Thomas Jefferson Bible Lined Cover.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.1|Jefferson's Bible featuring only the words of Jesus from the evangelists, in parallel Greek, Latin, French and English|alt=A leather-bound Bible]]

Baptized in his youth, Jefferson became a governing member of his local [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]] in Charlottesville, which he later attended with his daughters.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Randall|Randall, 1994]], p. 203.&lt;/ref&gt; Influenced by [[Deism|Deist]] authors during his college years Jefferson abandoned "orthodox" [[Christianity]] after his review of [[New Testament]] teachings.&lt;ref&gt;[[#TJFReligion|TJF: "Jefferson's Religious Beliefs"]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Onuf07|Onuf, 2007]], pp. 139–68.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1803 he asserted, "I am Christian, in the only sense in which [Jesus] wished any one to be."&lt;ref name="Randal583"/&gt; Jefferson later defined being a [[Christian]] as one who followed the simple teachings of [[Jesus]]. Jefferson compiled Jesus' biblical teachings, omitting miraculous or supernatural references. He titled the work ''The Life and Morals of Jesus of Nazareth'', known today as the ''[[Jefferson Bible]]''.&lt;ref name="Jefferson Bible, 1820"&gt;[[#Jesus|Jefferson Bible, 1820]]&lt;/ref&gt; Peterson states Jefferson was a [[Theism|theist]] "whose God was the Creator of the universe&amp;nbsp;... all the evidences of nature testified to His perfection; and man could rely on the harmony and beneficence of His work."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Peterson70|Peterson, 1970]], ch. 2 [e-book].&lt;/ref&gt;

Jefferson was firmly [[Anti-clericalism|anticlerical]], writing in "every age, the priest has been hostile to liberty&amp;nbsp;... they have perverted the purest religion ever preached to man into mystery and jargon."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Wood2010|Wood, 2010]], p. 577.&lt;/ref&gt; The full letter to Horatio Spatford can be read at the National Archives.&lt;ref&gt;[[#archives|U.S. Gov: National Archives]]&lt;/ref&gt; Jefferson once supported banning clergy from public office but later relented.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Finkelman2006|Finkelman, 2006]], p. 921.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1777, he drafted the [[Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom]]. Ratified in 1786, it made compelling attendance or contributions to any state-sanctioned religious establishment illegal and declared that men "shall be free to profess&amp;nbsp;... their opinions in matters of religion."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Yarbrough2006|Yarbrough, 2006]], p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; The Statute is one of only three accomplishments he chose to have inscribed in the epitaph on his gravestone.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Peterson|Peterson, 2003]], p. 315.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;W. W. Hening, ed., Statutes at Large of Virginia, vol. 12 (1823): 84–86.&lt;/ref&gt; Early in 1802, Jefferson wrote to the Danbury Connecticut Baptist Association, "that religion is a matter which lies solely between Man and his God." He interpreted the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] as having built "a wall of [[Separation of church and state|separation between Church and State]]."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Meacham|Meacham, 2012]], pp. 369–70.&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase 'Separation of Church and State' has been cited several times by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] in its interpretation of the [[Establishment Clause]].

Jefferson donated to the [[American Bible Society]], saying the [[Four Evangelists]] delivered a "pure and sublime system of morality" to humanity. He thought Americans would rationally create "[[Beekeeping|Apiarian]]" religion, extracting the best traditions of every denomination.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Meacham|Meacham]], 2012, pp. 472–73.&lt;/ref&gt; And he contributed generously to several local denominations nearby Monticello.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Randall|Randall, 1994]], p. 555.&lt;/ref&gt; Acknowledging [[organized religion]] would always be factored into political life for good or ill, he encouraged reason over supernatural revelation to make inquiries into religion. He believed in a [[Creator deity|creator god]], an [[afterlife]], and the sum of religion as loving God and neighbors. But he also controversially renounced the conventional Christian [[Trinity]], denying Jesus' divinity as the [[Son of God]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Meacham|Meacham, 2012]], pp. 471–73.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#sanford|Sanford, 1984]], pp. 85–86.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jefferson's unorthodox religious beliefs became an important issue in the [[United States presidential election, 1800|1800 presidential election]].&lt;ref name=Wood586&gt;[[#Wood2010|Wood, 2010]], p. 586.&lt;/ref&gt; Federalists attacked him as an [[Atheism|atheist]]. As president, Jefferson countered the accusations by praising religion in his inaugural address and attending services at the Capitol.&lt;ref name=Wood586/&gt;

===Banks===
[[File:Alexander Hamilton portrait by John Trumbull 1806.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.7|Alexander Hamilton, national bank proponent and Jefferson's adversary]]
Jefferson distrusted government banks and opposed public borrowing, which he thought created long-term debt, bred monopolies, and invited dangerous speculation as opposed to productive labor.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Malone81|Malone, 1981]], pp. 140–43.&lt;/ref&gt; In one letter to Madison, he argued each generation should curtail all debt within 19 years, and not impose a long-term debt on subsequent generations.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Meacham|Meacham, 2012]], pp. 224–25.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1791, President Washington asked Jefferson, then Secretary of State, and Hamilton, the Secretary of the Treasury, if the Congress had the authority to create a [[First Bank of the United States|national bank]]. While Hamilton believed Congress had the authority, Jefferson and Madison thought a national bank would ignore the needs of individuals and farmers, and would violate the [[Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Tenth Amendment]] by assuming powers not granted to the federal government by the states.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Wood2010|Wood, 2010]], p. 144; [[#Bailey2007|Bailey, 2007]], p. 82; [[#Meacham|Meacham, 2012]], p. 249.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jefferson used agrarian resistance to banks and speculators as the first defining principle of an opposition party, recruiting candidates for Congress on the issue as early as 1792.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ferling13|Ferling, 2013]], pp. 221–22.&lt;/ref&gt; As president, Jefferson was persuaded by Secretary of Treasury Albert Gallatin to leave the bank intact, but sought to restrain its influence.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Wood2010|Wood, 2010]], pp. 293–95.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|The First Bank of the U.S. was eventually abolished in 1811 by a heavily Republican Congress.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Wood2010|Wood, 2010]], pp. 295–96.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Slavery===
{{Main|Thomas Jefferson and slavery}}
[[File:Jefferson slaves.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Farm Book page|Jefferson's 1795 Farm Book, page 30, lists 163 slaves at Monticello.]]
Jefferson lived in a planter economy largely dependent upon slavery, and as a wealthy landholder, used slave labor for his household, plantation, and workshops. He first recorded his slaveholding in 1774, when he counted 41.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Cogliano|Cogliano, 2006]], p. 219; [[#Onuf07|Onuf, 2007]], p. 258.&lt;/ref&gt; Over his lifetime he owned about 600 slaves; he inherited about 175 while most of the remainder were born on his plantations.&lt;ref name = TJFSlaveryFAQ&gt;[[#TJFSlaveryFAQ|TJF: Slavery at Monticello – Property]]&lt;/ref&gt; Jefferson purchased slaves in order to unite their families, and he sold about 110 for economic reasons, primarily slaves from his outlying farms.&lt;ref name = TJFSlaveryFAQ/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Gordon08|Gordon-Reed, 2008]], p. 292.&lt;/ref&gt; Many historians have described Jefferson as a benevolent slaveowner&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bear|Bear, 1967]], p. 99; [[#Peterson60|Peterson, 1960]], p. 535; [[#Halliday09|Halliday, 2009]], p. 236.&lt;/ref&gt; who didn't overwork his slaves by the conventions of his time, and provided them log cabins with fireplaces, food, clothing and some household provisions, though slaves often had to make many of their own provisions. Additionally, Jefferson gave his slaves financial and other incentives while also allowing them to grow gardens and raise their own chickens. The whip was employed only in rare and extreme cases of fighting and stealing.&lt;ref name = TJFSlaveryFAQ/&gt;&lt;ref name = TJFSlaveDwellings&gt;[[#TJFSlaveDwellings|TJF – Thomas Jefferson's Monticello "Slave Dwellings"]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Jefferson once said, "My first wish is that the labourers may be well treated".&lt;ref name = TJFSlaveryFAQ/&gt; Jefferson did not work his slaves on Sundays and Christmas and he allowed them more personal time during the winter months.&lt;ref&gt;[[#TJFSlaveryWork|TJF: Slavery at Monticello – Work]]&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars doubt Jefferson's benevolence,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Wiencek12|Wiencek, 2012]], pp. 114, 122.&lt;/ref&gt; however, noting cases of excessive slave whippings in his absence. His nail factory was only staffed by child slaves, but many of those boys became tradesmen. Burwell Colbert, who started his working life as a child in Monticello's Nailery, was later promoted to the supervisory position of butler.&lt;ref&gt;[[#TJFNailery|TJF: Thomas Jefferson's Monticello – Nailery]],&lt;br /&gt;[[#Wiencek12|Wiencek, 2012]], p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jefferson felt slavery was harmful to both slave and master, but had reservations about releasing unprepared slaves into freedom and advocated gradual emancipation.&lt;ref name=TJFslavery&gt;[[#TJFslavery|TJF: Thomas Jefferson and Slavery]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ferling2000|Ferling, 2000]], p. 161.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Howe09|Howe, 2009]], p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1779, he proposed gradual voluntary training and resettlement to the Virginia legislature, and three years later drafted legislation allowing owners to free their own slaves.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Meacham|Meacham]], p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt; In his draft of the Declaration of Independence, he included a section, stricken by other Southern delegates, criticizing King George III's role in promoting slavery in the colonies.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Meacham|Meacham]], p. 475.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1784, Jefferson proposed the abolition of slavery in all western U.S. territories, limiting slave importation to 15 years.&lt;ref name=Ferling_2000_p287&gt;[[#Ferling2000|Ferling 2000]], p. 287.&lt;/ref&gt; Congress, however, failed to pass his proposal by one vote.&lt;ref name=Ferling_2000_p287/&gt; In 1787, Congress passed the Northwest Ordinance, a partial victory for Jefferson that terminated slavery in the Northwest Territory. Jefferson freed his slave Robert Hemings in 1794 and he freed his cook slave James Hemings in 1796.&lt;ref&gt;[[# Finkelman1994|Finkelman (1994)]], p. 215.&lt;/ref&gt; During his presidency Jefferson allowed the diffusion of slavery into the [[Louisiana Territory]] hoping to prevent slave uprisings in Virginia and to prevent [[South Carolina]] secession.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Freehling05|Freehling, 2005, p. 70]].&lt;/ref&gt; In 1804, in a compromise on the slavery issue, Jefferson and Congress banned domestic slave trafficking for one year into the Louisiana Territory.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Wiencek12|Wiencek, 2012]], pp. 257–58.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1806 he officially called for anti-slavery legislation terminating the import or export of slaves. Congress passed the law in 1807, taking effect in 1818.&lt;ref name=TJFslavery/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Du Bois|Du Bois, 1904]], pp. 95–96.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ferling_2000_p288&gt;[[#Ferling2000|Ferling 2000]], p. 288.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1819, he strongly opposed a Missouri statehood application amendment that banned domestic slave importation and freed slaves at the age of 25 on grounds it would destroy the union.&lt;ref name=Ferling_2000_pp286_294&gt;[[#Ferling2000|Ferling 2000]], pp. 286, 294.&lt;/ref&gt; Jefferson freed his runaway slave [[Harriet Hemings]] in 1822.&lt;ref name="Finkelman 1994 p. 215"/&gt; Upon his death in 1826, Jefferson freed five male Hemings slaves in his will.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Finkelman1994|Finkelman (1994)]], pp. 220–21.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jefferson shared the common belief of his day that blacks were mentally and physically inferior, but argued they nonetheless had innate human rights.&lt;ref name=TJFslavery/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Appleby|Appleby, 2003]], pp. 139–40.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Notes on the State of Virginia'', he created controversy by calling slavery a moral evil for which the nation would ultimately have to account to God.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ellis97|Ellis, 1997]], p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt; He therefore supported colonization plans that would transport freed slaves to another country, such as [[Liberia]] or [[Sierra Leone]], though he recognized the impracticability of such proposals.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Helo|Helo, 2013]], p. 105; [[#Peterson70|Peterson, 1970]], pp. 998–99; [[#Meacham|Meacham, 2012]], p. 478.&lt;/ref&gt;

During his presidency Jefferson was for the most part publicly silent on the issue of slavery and emancipation,&lt;ref name = TJFAntiSlaveryActions&gt;[[#TJFAntiSlaveryActions|TJF:Jefferson's Antislavery Actions]]&lt;/ref&gt; as the Congressional debate over slavery and its extension caused a dangerous north-south rift among the states, with talk of a northern confederacy in New England.&lt;ref&gt;[[#DiLo|DiLorenzo, 1998, Yankee Confederates]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|[[Aaron Burr]] was offered help in obtaining the governorship of New York by [[Timothy Pickering]] if he could persuade New York to go along, but the secession effort failed when Burr lost the election.}} The violent attacks on white slave owners during the [[Haitian Revolution]] due to injustices under slavery supported Jefferson's fears of a race war, increasing his reservations about promoting emancipation at that time.&lt;ref name=TJFslavery/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Meacham|Meacham, 2012]], pp. 255, 275–78.&lt;/ref&gt; After numerous attempts and failures to bring about emancipation,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ferling|Ferling 2000]], p. 287.&lt;/ref&gt; Jefferson wrote privately in an 1805 letter to [[William A. Burwell]], "I have long since given up the expectation of any early provision for the extinguishment of slavery among us." That same year he also related this idea to [[George Logan]], writing, "I have most carefully avoided every public act or manifestation on that subject."&lt;ref&gt;[[#TJFSlaveryQuotes|TJF: Quotations on slavery (May 11, 1805)]]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Historical assessment====
Scholars remain divided on whether Jefferson truly condemned slavery and how he changed.&lt;ref name="Finkelman 1994 p. 215"&gt;[[#Finkelman1994|Finkelman (1994)]], p. 215; [[#Finkelman2012|Finkelman (2012)]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Alexander10|Alexander, 2010]]; [[#Davis99|Davis, 1999]], p. 179.&lt;/ref&gt; [[#Cogliano|Francis D. Cogliano]] traces the development of competing emancipationist then revisionist and finally contextualist interpretations from the 1960s to the present. The emancipationist view, held by the various scholars at the [[Thomas Jefferson Foundation]], [[Douglas L. Wilson]], and others, maintains Jefferson was an opponent of slavery all his life, noting that he did what he could within the limited range of options available to him to undermine it, his many attempts at abolition legislation, the manner in which he provided for slaves, and his advocacy of their more humane treatment.&lt;ref name = TJFSlaveDwellings/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#TJFTreatment|Landscape of Slavery – Mulberry Row at Monticello: Treatment]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Cogliano|Cogliano, 2008]], p. 209.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|For examples of each historian's view, see [[#Wilson16|Wilson, Douglas L.]], ''Thomas Jefferson and the Issue of Character'', ''The Atlantic'', Nov. 1992. [[#Finkelman1994|Finkelman (1994)]]  "Thomas Jefferson and Antislavery: The Myth Goes On" and [[#Ellis96|Joseph J. Ellis, 1996]], American Sphinx: the character of Thomas Jefferson}} The revisionist view, advanced by [[Paul Finkelman]] and others, criticizes Jefferson for racism, for holding slaves, and for acting contrary to his words. Jefferson never freed most of his slaves, and he remained silent on the issue while he was president.&lt;ref name = TJFAntiSlaveryActions/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Finkelman2012|Finkelman (2012)]]&lt;/ref&gt; Contextualists such as [[Joseph J. Ellis]] emphasize a change in Jefferson's thinking from his emancipationist views before 1783, noting Jefferson's shift toward public passivity and procrastination on policy issues related to slavery. Jefferson seemed to yield to public opinion by 1794 as he laid the groundwork for his first presidential campaign against Adams in 1796.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Cogliano|Cogliano, 2008]], pp. 218–20.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Jefferson–Hemings controversy====
{{Main|Jefferson–Hemings controversy}}
Claims that Jefferson fathered [[Sally Hemings]]'s children have been debated since 1802. That year [[James T. Callender]], after being denied a position as [[postmaster]], alleged Jefferson had taken Hemings as a concubine and fathered several children with her.&lt;ref&gt;In 1853, [[William Wells Brown]] published a novel called [[Clotel]] or The President's Daughter alluding to Jefferson. This is the first novel in America published by anyone of African descent.[[#Hyland2009|Hyland, 2009]], pp. ix, 2–3.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, a panel of researchers conducted a [[Y-DNA]] study of living descendants of Jefferson's uncle, Field, and of a descendant of Hemings's son, [[Eston Hemings]]. The results, published in the journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', showed a match with the male Jefferson line.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Foster|Foster et al., 1998]]&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Thomas Jefferson Foundation, since the results of the DNA tests were made public, most historians believe Jefferson had a relationship with Hemings&lt;ref&gt;[[#TJFSally|TJF: Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings: A Brief Account]]&lt;/ref&gt; and, as of 2018, "the issue is a settled historical matter".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.monticello.org/site/blog-and-community/monticello-affirms-thomas-jefferson-fathered-children-sally-hemings Monticello Affirms Thomas Jefferson Fathered Children with Sally Hemings], Thomas Jefferson Foundation, June 6, 2018; accessed July 5, 2018&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, the Thomas Jefferson Foundation (TJF) assembled a team of historians whose report concluded that "the DNA study&amp;nbsp;... indicates a high probability that Thomas Jefferson fathered Eston Hemings".&lt;ref&gt;[[#TJFConclusions|TJF: Report of the Research Committee on Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings – Conclusions]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|The minority report from White Wallenborn stated that "the historical evidence is not substantial enough to confirm nor for that matter to refute his paternity of any of the children of Sally Hemings.

It is part of their Mountaintop Project of restoration.&lt;ref name="nbc"&gt;[https://www.nbcnews.com/news/nbcblk/thomas-jefferson-sally-hemings-living-quarters-found-n771261 Michael Cottman, "Historians Uncover Slave Quarters of Sally Hemings at Thomas Jefferson's Monticello"], NBC News, July 3, 2017; accessed February 4, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wapost"&gt;Krissah Thompson, "[https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/for-decades-they-hid-jeffersons-mistress-now-monticello-is-making-room-for-sally-hemings/2017/02/18/d410d660-f222-11e6-8d72-263470bf0401_story.html For decades they hid Jefferson’s relationship with her. Now Monticello is making room for Sally Hemings].", ''Washington Post'', February 18, 2017; accessed February 4, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

After Thomas Jefferson's death, although not formally [[manumission#United States|manumitted]], Sally Hemings was allowed by Jefferson's daughter Martha to live in [[Charlottesville, Virginia|Charlottesville]] as a [[free negro|free woman]] with her two sons until her death in 1835.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reed97|Gordon-Reed, 1997]], pp. 657–60.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|[[Annette Gordon-Reed]] notes that it would have been legally challenging to free Sally Hemings, due to Virginia laws mandating the support of older slaves and requiring special permission for freed slaves to remain within the state.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reed97|Gordon-Reed, 1997]], pp. 658–59.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Some scholars maintain the evidence is insufficient to prove Jefferson's paternity conclusively. Based on DNA and other evidence, they note the possibility that additional Jefferson males, including his brother Randolph Jefferson and any one of Randolph's four sons, or his cousin, could have fathered Eston Hemings or Sally Hemings's other children.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hyland2009|Hyland, 2009]], pp. 30–31, 79; [[#TJHS|Thomas Jefferson Heritage Society]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interests and activities==
[[File:Virginia State Capitol Building.jpg|thumb|right|Virginia State Capitol, designed by Jefferson (wings added later)]]
Jefferson was a farmer, obsessed with new crops, soil conditions, garden designs, and scientific agricultural techniques. His main cash crop was tobacco, but its price was usually low and it was rarely profitable. He tried to achieve self-sufficiency with wheat, vegetables, flax, corn, hogs, sheep, poultry, and cattle to supply his family, slaves, and employees, but he lived perpetually beyond his means&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.monticello.org/site/research-and-collections/debt Debt], Thomas Jefferson Foundation; accessed October 9, 2018&lt;/ref&gt; and was always in debt.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hayes|Hayes, 2008]], p. 100; [[#McEwan|McEwan, 1991]], pp. 20–39.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the field of architecture, Jefferson helped popularize the Neo-Palladian style in the United States utilizing designs for the [[Virginia State Capitol]], the University of Virginia, Monticello, and others.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bernstein03|Berstein, 2003]], p. 193; [[#Tucker37|Tucker, 1837]], v. 2, p. 202.&lt;/ref&gt; Jefferson mastered architecture through [[Autodidacticism|self-study]], using various books and classical architectural designs of the day. His primary authority was [[Andrea Palladio]]'s ''The Four Books of Architecture'', which outlines the principles of classical design.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Brodie|Brodie, 1974]], pp. 87–88; [[#Bernstein03|Bernstein, 2003]], p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

He was interested in birds and wine, and was a noted [[gourmet]]; he was also a prolific writer and linguist, and spoke several languages.&lt;ref name=Hayes135&gt;[[#Hayes|Hayes, 2008]], pp. 135–36.&lt;/ref&gt; As a naturalist, he was fascinated by the [[Natural Bridge (Virginia)|Natural Bridge]] geological formation, and in 1774 successfully acquired the Bridge by grant from George III.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kastning|Kastning, 2014]], p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

===American Philosophical Society===

Jefferson was a member of the [[American Philosophical Society]] for 35 years, beginning in 1780. Through the society he advanced the [[Science in the Age of Enlightenment|sciences and Enlightenment ideals]], emphasizing that knowledge of science reinforced and extended freedom.&lt;ref name=Hayes432&gt;[[#Hayes|Hayes, 2008]], p. 432.&lt;/ref&gt; His ''Notes on the State of Virginia'' was written in part as a contribution to the society.&lt;ref name=TJFAPS&gt;[[#TJFAPS|TJF: "American Philosophical Society"]]&lt;/ref&gt; He became the society's third president on March 3, 1797, a few months after he was elected Vice President of the United States.&lt;ref name=TJFAPS/&gt;&lt;ref name=Berstein118&gt;[[#Bernstein03|Bernstein, 2003]], pp. 118–19.&lt;/ref&gt; In accepting, Jefferson stated: "I feel no qualification for this distinguished post but a sincere zeal for all the objects of our institution and an ardent desire to see knowledge so disseminated through the mass of mankind that it may at length reach even the extremes of society, beggars and kings."&lt;ref name=Hayes432/&gt;

Jefferson served as APS president for the next eighteen years, including through both terms of his presidency.&lt;ref name=TJFAPS/&gt; He introduced [[Meriwether Lewis]] to the society, where various scientists tutored him in preparation for the [[Lewis and Clark Expedition]].&lt;ref name=TJFAPS/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ambrose, 1996, p. 126"&gt;[[#Ambrose|Ambrose, 1996]], p. 126.&lt;/ref&gt; He resigned on January 20, 1815, but remained active through correspondence.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Tucker37|Tucker, 1837]], v. 2, p. 399.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Linguistics===

Jefferson had a lifelong interest in [[linguistics]], and could speak, read, and write in a number of languages, including French, Greek, Italian, and German. In his early years he excelled in classical language while at boarding school&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[[#Miller|Univ. Virginia archives: Miller Center]]&lt;/ref&gt; where he received a classical education in Greek and Latin.&lt;ref&gt;[[Andresen]], 2006, Chap. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Jefferson later came to regard the Greek language as the "perfect language" as expressed in its laws and philosophy.&lt;ref name=Boberchap1&gt;[[#Bober|Bober, 2008]], p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; While attending the College of William &amp; Mary, he taught himself Italian.&lt;ref name=Italy&gt;[[#TJFItaly|TJF: Italy – Language]]&lt;/ref&gt; Here Jefferson first became familiar with the [[Anglo-Saxon]] language, especially as it was associated with [[English Law#Common law|English Common law]] and system of government and studied the language in a linguistic and philosophical capacity. He owned 17 volumes of Anglo-Saxon texts and grammar and later wrote an essay on the Anglo-Saxon language.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Jefferson claimed to have taught himself Spanish during his nineteen-day journey to France, using only a grammar guide and a copy of ''[[Don Quixote]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[#TJFSpanish|TJF: Spanish Language]]&lt;/ref&gt; Linguistics played a significant role in how Jefferson modeled and expressed political and philosophical ideas. He believed that the study of ancient languages was essential in understanding the roots of modern language.&lt;ref name=Hellen155&gt;[[#Hellenbrand|Hellenbrand, 1990]], pp. 155–56.&lt;/ref&gt; He collected and understood a number of [[Indigenous languages of the Americas|American Indian vocabularies]] and instructed Lewis and Clark to record and collect various Indian languages during their Expedition.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Frawley|Frawley, 2003]], p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt; When Jefferson removed from Washington after his presidency, he packed 50 Native American vocabulary lists in a chest and transported them on a river boat back to Monticello along with the rest of his possessions. Somewhere along the journey, a thief stole the heavy chest, thinking it was full of valuables, but its contents were dumped into the James River when the thief discovered it was only filled with papers. Subsequently, 30 years of collecting were lost, with only a few fragments rescued from the muddy banks of the river.&lt;ref&gt;[[#apsmuseum|American Philosophical Society, 2016: Gathering voices]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Jefferson was not an outstanding orator and preferred to communicate through writing or remain silent if possible. Instead of delivering his [[State of the Union]] addresses himself, Jefferson wrote the annual messages and sent a representative to read them aloud in Congress. This started a tradition which continued until 1913, when President [[Woodrow Wilson]] (1913–1921) chose to deliver his own State of the Union address.&lt;ref&gt;[[#TJFSpeaking|TJF: "Public speaking"]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inventions===
Jefferson invented many small practical devices and improved contemporary inventions, including a revolving book-stand and a "Great Clock" powered by the gravitational pull on cannonballs. He improved the [[pedometer]], the [[polygraph (duplicating device)|polygraph]] (a device for duplicating writing),&lt;ref&gt;[[#cipher|Univ. Virginia archives]]&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[moldboard plow]], an idea he never patented and gave to posterity.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Malone62|Malone, 1962]], pp. 213–15.&lt;/ref&gt; Jefferson can also be credited as the creator of the [[swivel chair#Origin|swivel chair]], the first of which he created and used to write much of the Declaration of Independence.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kaplan|Kaplan, 1993]], p. 315.&lt;/ref&gt;

As Minister to France, Jefferson was impressed by the military standardization program known as the ''[[Gribeauval system|Système Gribeauval]]'', and initiated a program as president to develop [[interchangeable parts]] for firearms. For his inventiveness and ingenuity, he received several honorary Doctor of Law degrees.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Peterson70|Peterson, 1970]], pp. 335–36.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical reputation==
{{Further|List of places named for Thomas Jefferson}}
[[File:Jefferson Memorial (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright=1.05|right|alt=Jefferson Memorial building and reflecting pool|Jefferson Memorial, Washington, D.C.]]
Jefferson is an icon of individual liberty, democracy, and republicanism, hailed as the author of the Declaration of Independence, an architect of the American Revolution, and a renaissance man who promoted science and scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Peterson60|Peterson, 1960]], pp. 5, 67–69, 189–208, 340.&lt;/ref&gt; The participatory democracy and expanded suffrage he championed defined his era and became a standard for later generations.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Appleby|Appleby, 2006]], p. 149.&lt;/ref&gt; Meacham opined, that Jefferson was the most influential figure of the democratic republic in its first half century, succeeded by presidential adherents [[James Madison]], [[James Monroe]], [[Andrew Jackson]], and [[Martin Van Buren]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Meacham|Meacham, 2012]], p. xix.&lt;/ref&gt; Jefferson is recognized for having written more than 18,000 letters of political and philosophical substance during his life, which Francis D. Cogliano describes as "a documentary legacy&amp;nbsp;... unprecedented in American history in its size and breadth."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Cogliano|Cogliano, 2008]], p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jefferson's reputation declined during the [[American Civil War]], due to his support of [[states' rights]]. In the late 19th century, his legacy was widely criticized; conservatives felt that his democratic philosophy had led to that era's populist movement, while [[Progressivism in the United States|Progressives]] sought a more activist federal government than Jefferson's philosophy allowed. Both groups saw [[Alexander Hamilton]] as vindicated by history, rather than Jefferson, and President [[Woodrow Wilson]] even described Jefferson as "though a great man, not a great American".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bernstein03|Bernstein, 2003]], pp. 191–92; [[#Appleby|Appleby, 2003]], pp. 132–33.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Thomas Jefferson Memorial front.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|left|alt=Statue of Thomas Jefferson inside Jefferson Memorial|Thomas Jefferson&lt;br /&gt;Memorial Statue]]
In the 1930s, Jefferson was held in higher esteem; President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] (1933–45) and [[New Deal]] Democrats celebrated his struggles for "the common man" and reclaimed him as their party's founder. Jefferson became a symbol of American democracy in the incipient [[Cold War]], and the 1940s and 1950s saw the zenith of his popular reputation.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bernstein03|Bernstein, 2003]], pp. 192–94; [[#Appleby|Appleby, 2003]], pp. 135–36.&lt;/ref&gt; Following the [[civil rights movement]] of the 1950s and 1960s, Jefferson's slaveholding came under new scrutiny, particularly after DNA testing in the late 1990s supported allegations that he had a relationship with Sally Hemings.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Cogliano|Cogliano, 2008]], p. 12; [[#Appleby|Appleby, 2003]], p. 136, 140; [[#Bernstein03|Bernstein, 2003]], pp. 194–97.&lt;/ref&gt;

Noting the huge output of scholarly books on Jefferson in recent years, historian Gordon Wood summarizes the raging debates about Jefferson's stature: "Although many historians and others are embarrassed about his contradictions and have sought to knock him off the democratic pedestal&amp;nbsp;... his position, though shaky, still seems secure."&lt;ref&gt;Gordon S. Wood. "Revealing the Total Jefferson," The New York Review of Books. June 23, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Siena Research Institute]] poll of presidential scholars, begun in 1982, has consistently ranked Jefferson as one of the five best U.S. presidents,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Siena|SRI]], 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; and a 2015 [[Brookings Institution]] poll of [[American Political Science Association]] members ranked him as the fifth greatest president.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Brookings|Brookings, 2015]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Memorials and honors===
[[File:Dean Franklin - 06.04.03 Mount Rushmore Monument (by-sa)-3 new.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|(left to right) Washington, Jefferson, T. Roosevelt and Lincoln sculptured into Mt. Rushmore]]
Jefferson has been memorialized with buildings, sculptures, [[U.S. presidents on U.S. postage stamps|postage]], and [[United States dollar|currency]]. In the 1920s, Jefferson, together with George Washington, [[Theodore Roosevelt]], and Abraham Lincoln, was chosen by sculptor [[Gutzon Borglum]] and approved by President [[Calvin Coolidge]] to be depicted in stone at the [[Mount Rushmore]] Memorial.&lt;ref name="rushmore"&gt;[[#Rushmore|NPS: Mt. Rushmore]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Jefferson Memorial]] was dedicated in [[Washington, D.C.]] in 1943, on the 200th anniversary of Jefferson's birth. The interior of the memorial includes a {{convert|19|ft|m|0|adj=on}} statue of Jefferson and engravings of passages from his writings. Most prominent are the words inscribed around the monument near the roof: "I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Peterson60|Peterson, 1960]], p. 378.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Platonism|dialogues=show}}

'''''Timaeus''''' ({{IPAc-en|t|aɪ|ˈ|m|iː|ə|s}}; {{lang-grc-gre|Τίμαιος|Timaios}}, {{IPA-grc|tǐːmai̯os|pron}}) is one of [[Plato#Dialogues|Plato's dialogues]], mostly in the form of a long monologue given by the title character [[Timaeus of Locri]], written c. 360 BC. The work puts forward speculation on the nature of the physical world and human beings and is followed by the dialogue ''[[Critias (dialogue)|Critias]]''.

Participants in the [[dialogue]] include [[Socrates]], Timaeus, [[Hermocrates]], and [[Critias]]. Some scholars believe that it is not the Critias of the [[Thirty Tyrants]] who is appearing in this dialogue, but his grandfather, who is also named Critias.&lt;ref&gt;See Burnet, John (1913). ''Greek Philosophy, Part 1: Thales to Plato''. London: Macmillan, p. 328&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, AE (1928). ''A commentary on Plato's Timaeus''. Oxford: Clarendon, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nails, Debra (2002). "Critias III," in ''The People of Plato''. Indianapolis: Hackett, pp. 106–7.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that ''Timaeus'' was influenced by a book about [[Pythagoras]], written by [[Philolaus#Writings|Philolaus]].

==Introduction==
[[File:Athanasius Kircher's Atlantis.gif|thumb|left|[[Athanasius Kircher]]'s map of Atlantis from ''Mundus Subterraneus'' (1669) drawn with south at the top.]]
The dialogue takes place the day after Socrates described his ideal state. In Plato's works such a discussion occurs in the [[Republic (Plato)|Republic]]. Socrates feels that his description of the ideal state wasn't sufficient for the purposes of entertainment and that "I would be glad to hear some account of it engaging in transactions with other states" (19b).

Hermocrates wishes to oblige Socrates and mentions that Critias knows just the account (20b) to do so. Critias proceeds to tell the story of [[Solon]]'s journey to Egypt where he hears the story of [[Atlantis]], and how Athens used to be an ideal state that subsequently waged war against Atlantis (25a). Critias believes that he is getting ahead of himself, and mentions that Timaeus will tell part of the account from the origin of the [[universe]] to man.

Critias also cites the Egyptian priest in [[Sais]] about long term factors on the fate of mankind:&lt;blockquote&gt;''"There have been, and will be again, many destructions of mankind arising out of many causes; the greatest have been brought about by the agencies of fire and water, and other lesser ones by innumerable other causes. There is a story that even you [Greeks] have preserved, that once upon a time, [[Phaethon]], the son of Helios, having yoked the steeds in his father's chariot, because he was not able to drive them in the path of his father, burnt up all that was upon the earth, and was himself destroyed by a thunderbolt.  Now this has the form of a myth, but really signifies a declination of the bodies moving in the heavens around the earth, and a great conflagration of things upon the earth, which recurs after long intervals."&lt;ref&gt;Translation by [[Benjamin Jowett]] (1817-1893) reproduced in, for example, [https://books.google.com/books?id=wTNctKDjxaMC&amp;pg=PA4&amp;dq=Jowett+Timaeus+Phaethon&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=K1EwUt6bK-nC7Aa4zICgAQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Jowett%20Timaeus%20Phaethon&amp;f=false John Michael Greer, ''Atlantis'' (Llewelyn Worldwide 2007] {{ISBN|978-0-73870978-9}}), p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The history of Atlantis is postponed to ''[[Critias (dialogue)|Critias]]''. The main content of the dialogue, the exposition by Timaeus, follows.

==Synopsis of Timaeus' account==

===Nature of the physical world===

[[File:Raffael 067.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Plato]] is depicted in [[Raphael|Raphael's]] ''[[The School of Athens]]'' anachronistically carrying a bound copy of ''Timaeus''.]]

Timaeus begins with a distinction between the physical world, and the [[eternity|eternal]] world. The physical one is the world which changes and perishes: therefore it is the object of opinion and unreasoned sensation. The eternal one never changes: therefore it is apprehended by reason (28a).

The speeches about the two worlds are conditioned by the different nature of their objects. Indeed, "a description of what is changeless, fixed and clearly intelligible will be changeless and fixed," (29b), while a description of what changes and is likely, will also change and be just likely. "As being is to becoming, so is truth to belief" (29c). Therefore, in a description of the physical world, one "should not look for anything more than a likely story" (29d).

Timaeus suggests that since nothing "becomes or changes" without cause, then the cause of the universe must be a [[demiurge]] or a god, a figure Timaeus refers to as the father and maker of the universe. And since the universe is fair, the [[demiurge]] must have looked to the eternal model to make it, and not to the perishable one (29a). Hence, using the eternal and perfect world of "[[Theory of forms|forms]]" or ideals as a template, he set about creating our world, which formerly only existed in a state of disorder.

===Purpose of the universe===
Timaeus continues with an explanation of the creation of the universe, which he ascribes to the handiwork of a divine craftsman. The demiurge, being good, wanted there to be as much good as was the world.  The [[demiurge]] is said to bring order out of substance by imitating an unchanging and eternal model (paradigm). The ''[[ananke]]'', often translated as 'necessity', was the only other co-existent element or presence in Plato's [[cosmogony]]. Later Platonists clarified that the eternal model existed in the mind of the Demiurge.

===Properties of the universe===

Timaeus describes the substance as a lack of homogeneity or balance, in which the [[Classical element|four elements]] ([[earth (classical element)|earth]], [[air (classical element)|air]], [[fire (classical element)|fire]] and [[water (classical element)|water]]) were shapeless, mixed and in constant motion. Considering that order is favourable over disorder, the essential act of the creator was to bring order and clarity to this substance. Therefore, all the properties of the world are to be explained by the [[demiurge]]'s choice of what is fair and good; or, the idea of a dichotomy between good and [[evil]].

First of all, the world is a ''living creature''. Since the unintelligent creatures are in their appearance less fair than intelligent creatures, and since intelligence needs to be settled in a soul, the [[demiurge]] "put intelligence in soul, and soul in body" in order to make a living and intelligent whole. "Wherefore, using the language of probability, we may say that the world became a living creature truly endowed with soul and intelligence by the providence of God" (30a-b).

Then, since the part is imperfect compared to the whole, the world had to be one and only. Therefore, the demiurge did not create several worlds, but a single unique world (31b). Additionally, because the demiurge wanted his creation to be a perfect imitation of the Eternal "One" (the source of all other emanations), there was no need to create more than one world.

The creator decided also to make the perceptible body of the universe by four elements, in order to render it ''proportioned''. Indeed, in addition to fire and earth, which make bodies visible and solid, a third element was required as a mean: "two things cannot be rightly put together without a third; there must be some bond of union between them". Moreover, since the world is not a surface but a solid, a fourth mean was needed to reach harmony: therefore, the creator placed water and air between fire and earth. "And for these reasons, and out of such elements which are in number four, the body of the world was created, and it was harmonised by proportion" (31-33).

As for the figure, the demiurge created the world in the geometric form of a ''globe''. Indeed, the round figure is the most perfect one, because it comprehends or averages all the other figures and it is the most omnimorphic of all figures: "he [the demiurge] considered that the like is infinitely fairer than the unlike" (33b).

The creator assigned then to the world a rotatory or ''circular movement'', which is the "most appropriate to mind and intelligence" on account of its being the most uniform (34a).

Finally, he created the [[Anima mundi (spirit)|soul of the world]], placed that soul in the center of the world's body and diffused it in every direction. Having thus been created as a perfect, self-sufficient and intelligent being, the world is a ''god'' (34b).

===The Creation of the World Soul===
Timaeus then explains how the soul of the world was created (Plato's following discussion is obscure, and almost certainly intended to be read in light of the [[Sophist (dialogue)|''Sophist'']]). The demiurge combined three elements: two varieties of ''Sameness'' (one indivisible and another divisible), two varieties of ''Difference'' (again, one indivisible and another divisible), and two types of ''Being'' (or ''Existence,'' once more, one indivisible and another divisible). From this emerged three compound substances, intermediate (or mixed) Being, intermediate Sameness, and intermediate Difference. From this compound one final substance resulted, the World Soul.&lt;ref&gt;"The components from which he made the soul and the way in which he made it were as follows: In between the ''Being'' that is indivisible and always changeless, and the one that is divisible and comes to be in the corporeal realm, he mixed a third, intermediate form of being, derived from the other two. Similarly, he made a mixture of the ''Same,'' and then one of the ''Different,'' in between their indivisible and their corporeal, divisible counterparts. And he took the three mixtures and mixed them together to make a uniform mixture, forcing the Different, which was hard to mix, into conformity with the Same. Now when he had mixed these two with Being, and from the three had made a single mixture, he redivided the whole mixture into as many parts as his task required, each part remaining a mixture of the Same, the Different and Being." (35a-b), translation Donald J. Zeyl&lt;/ref&gt; He then divided following precise mathematical proportions, cutting the compound lengthways, fixed the resulting two bands in their middle, like in the letter [[Chi (letter)|Χ (chi)]], and connected them at their ends, to have two crossing circles. The demiurge imparted on them a circular movement on their axis: the outer circle was assigned Sameness and turned horizontally to the right, while the inner circle was assigned to Difference and turned diagonally and to the left (34c-36c).

The demiurge gave the primacy to the motion of Sameness and left it undivided; but he divided the motion of Difference in six parts, to have seven unequal circles. He prescribed these circles to move in opposite directions, three of them with equal speeds, the others with unequal speeds, but always in proportion. These circles are the orbits of the [[Geocentrism|heavenly bodies]]: the three moving at equal speeds are the Sun, Venus and Mercury, while the four moving at unequal speeds are the Moon, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn (36c-d). The complicated pattern of these movements is bound to be repeated again after a period called a 'complete' or [[Platonic year|'perfect' year]] (39d).

Then, the demiurge connected the body and the soul of the universe: he diffused the soul from the center of the body to its extremities in every direction, allowing the invisible soul to envelop the visible body. The soul began to rotate and this was the beginning of its eternal and rational life (36e).

Therefore, having been composed by Sameness, Difference and Existence (their mean), and formed in right proportions, the soul declares the sameness or difference of every object it meets: when it is a sensible object, the inner circle of the Diverse transmit its movement to the soul, where opinions arise, but when it is an intellectual object, the circle of the Same turns perfectly round and true knowledge arises (37a-c).

===The Elements===
Timaeus claims that the minute particle of each element had a special [[Platonic solid|geometric shape]]: [[tetrahedron]] (fire), [[octahedron]] (air), [[icosahedron]] (water), and [[cube]] (earth).

[[File:Dodecahedron.gif|thumb|upright=0.56|[[Dodecahedron]] - [[Aether (classical element)|the fifth element]]]]
The ''Timaeus'' makes conjectures on the composition of the four elements which some [[ancient Greeks]] thought constituted the physical universe: earth, water, air, and fire.  Timaeus links each of these elements to a certain [[Platonic solid]]: the element of earth would be a [[cube]], of air an [[octahedron]], of water an [[icosahedron]], and of fire a [[tetrahedron]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Plat.+Tim.+53c Plato, Timaeus, 53c]&lt;/ref&gt;  Each of these perfect [[polyhedron|polyhedra]] would be in turn composed of triangular faces the [[Special right triangles#Angle-based|30-60-90]] and the 45-45-90 triangles. The faces of each element could be broken down into its component right-angled triangles, either isosceles or scalene, which could then be put together to form all of physical matter.  Particular characteristics of matter, such as water's capacity to extinguish fire, was then related to shape and size of the constituent triangles. The fifth element (i.e. Platonic solid) was the [[dodecahedron]], whose faces are not triangular, and which was taken to represent the shape of the Universe as a whole, possibly because of all the elements it most approximates a sphere, which Timaeus has already noted was the shape into which God had formed the Universe.

The extensive final part of the dialogue addresses the creation of humans, including the [[soul]], [[anatomy]], [[perception]], and [[transmigration of the soul]].

==Later influence==
[[File:Timaeus trans calcidius med manuscript.jpg|thumb|Medieval manuscript of Calcidius' Latin ''Timaeus'' translation.]]
The ''Timaeus'' was translated into Latin by [[Cicero]],&lt;ref&gt;Cicero's version can be found at http://www.forumromanum.org/literature/cicero_timaeus.html&lt;/ref&gt; and the first part (to 53c) was again translated by [[Calcidius]] c. 321 AD. Calcidius' partial translation of the ''Timaeus'' was the only Platonic dialogue, and one of the few works of classical [[natural philosophy]], available to Latin readers in the early [[Middle Ages]]. Thus it had a strong influence on medieval [[Neoplatonic]] cosmology and was commented on particularly by 12th century Christian philosophers of the [[Chartres School]], such as [[Thierry of Chartres]] and [[William of Conches]], who, interpreting it in the light of the Christian faith, understood the dialogue to refer to a [[creatio ex nihilo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Stiefel, Tina | title=The Intellectual Revolution in Twelfth Century Europe | publisher=[[St. Martin's Press]] |location=New York | date=1985 | isbn=0-312-41892-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Uriel da Costa''' ({{IPA-pt|uɾiˈɛɫ dɐ ˈkɔʃtɐ|lang}}; c. 1585 – April 1640), '''Uriel Acosta''' or '''d'Acosta''' (from the [[Latin]] form of his [[Portugal|Portuguese]] surname, ''[[Costa (surname)|Costa]]'', or ''[[da Costa]]'') was a Jewish [[philosopher]] and [[skeptic]] who questioned the Catholic and [[Rabbinic Judaism|Rabbinic]] institutions of his time.

==Life==
Many details about his life appear in his short autobiography, but over the past two centuries documents uncovered in Portugal, Amsterdam, Hamburg and more have changed and added much in the picture.

Costa was born in  [[Porto]] with the name '''Gabriel da Costa Fiuza'''. His ancestors were ''Cristãos-novos'', or [[New Christians]], [[Religious conversion|converted]] from [[Judaism]] to [[Roman Catholicism|Catholicism]] [[Persecution of Jews and Muslims by Manuel I of Portugal|by state edict]] at 1497.&lt;ref&gt;Salomon &amp; Sassoon, introduction to da Costa's Examination of Pharisaic Traditions, 1993 [p. 2].&lt;/ref&gt; His father was a well-off international merchant and tax-farmer.&lt;ref&gt;Salomon &amp; Sassoon, introduction to da Costa's Examination of Pharisaic Traditions, 1993 [p. 4].&lt;/ref&gt;

Studying [[Canon law of the Catholic Church|canon law]] in the [[University of Coimbra]] intermittently between 1600 and 1608, he began to read the [[Bible]] and contemplate it seriously. Costa also occupied an ecclesiastical office. In his autobiography Costa pictured his family as devout Catholics. However they have been subjects to several investigations by the [[Portuguese Inquisition|Inquisition]], suggesting they were [[Marrano|Conversos]], more or less close to Jewish customs. Gabriel explicitly supported the adherence to Mosaic prescriptions as well as traditional ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=|title=In the shadow of history : Jews and conversos at the dawn of modernity|last=Faur|first=José|date=1992|publisher=State University of New York Press|year=|isbn=9780791408018|location=|pages=esp. 123|oclc=878665784}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After his father died, the family came in greater need of some debts they had not been paid. In 1614 they changed this predicament as they sneaked out of Portugal with a significant sum of money they previously collected as tax-farmers for [[:pt:Jorge de Mascarenhas|Jorge de Mascarenhas]]. The family took Jewish names, and headed to two major [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardic]] [[diaspora]] communities. Newly circumcised, two brothers settled in [[Amsterdam]], and two with their mother in [[Hamburg]]. Gabriel was in the latter city, and became '''Uriel''' for the Jewish neighbors, and '''Adam Romez''' for outside relations, presumably because he was wanted in Portugal. All resumed their international trade business.&lt;ref&gt;Salomon &amp; Sassoon, introduction to da Costa's Examination of Pharisaic Traditions, 1993 [p. 6-8].&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon arriving there, Costa quickly became disenchanted with the kind of Judaism he saw in practice. He came to believe that the [[rabbi]]nic leadership was too consumed by [[ritual]]ism and [[Halakha|legalistic]] posturing. His earliest known written message is known as "Objections against tradition".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/dieschriftendesu00acos|title=Die Schriften des Uriel da Costa|last=Acosta|first=Uriel|last2=Gebhardt|first2=Carl|date=1922-01-01|publisher=Amsterdam, M. Hertzberger|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=1–10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In eleven short theses he called into question the disparity between certain Jewish customs and a literal reading of the [[Law of Moses]], and more generally tried to prove from reason and scripture that this system of law is sufficient. In 1616 the text was dispatched to the leaders of the prominent [[History of the Jews in Venice |Jewish community in Venice]]. The Venetians ruled against it and prompted the [[Portuguese Jewish community in Hamburg|Hamburg community]] to sanction Costa with a  [[Herem (censure)|''herem'', or excommunication]]. The ''Objections'' are extant only as quotes and paraphrases in ''Magen ṿe-tsinah (מגן וצנה''; "Shield and Buckler"), a longer rebuttal by [[Leon of Modena]], of the Venice community,&lt;ref&gt;Salomon &amp; Sassoon, introduction to da Costa's Examination of Pharisaic Traditions, 1993 [p. 9-12].&lt;/ref&gt; who responded to religious queries about Costa sent by the Hamburg Jewish authorities.&lt;ref&gt;Leone of Modena later published a developed iconoclastic treatise of his own ("kol sakhal / shaagat arye"), and it is quite possible that da
Costa's doubts had some influence on him. Salomon &amp; Sassoon, introduction to da Costa's Examination of Pharisaic Traditions, 1993 [p. 24-29].&lt;/ref&gt;

Costa's 1616 attempts resulted in official excommunication in Venice and Hamburg. It is not known what this meant in practice, Costa barely mentions it in his autobiography, and he would continue his international business. In 1623 he moved to Amsterdam for an unknown reason.&lt;ref&gt;Previous research concluded he went to Hamburg after a time in Amsterdam, but some official documents show otherwise.&lt;/ref&gt; The leaders of the Amsterdam Sephardic community were troubled by the arrival of a known [[Heresy in Judaism|heretic]],&lt;ref&gt;Salomon &amp; Sassoon, introduction to da Costa's Examination of Pharisaic Traditions, 1993 [p. 12-16].&lt;/ref&gt; staged a hearing and approved the excommunication set by the previous authorities.

At about the same time (in Hamburg or Amsterdam) Costa was working on a second treatise. Three chapters of the unpublished manuscript were stolen, and formed the target for a traditionalist rebuttal quickly published by [[Samuel da Silva|Semuel da Silva]] of Hamburg; so Costa enlarged his book and the printed version already contains responses and revisions to the crux of the tract.

In 1623 Costa published the Portuguese book, titled ''An Examination of the Traditions of the Pharisees''.&lt;ref&gt;The complete printed book was discovered in 1990 at the [[Royal Library, Denmark|Danish Royal Library]] by H P Salomon; previously only the three chapters had been known.&lt;/ref&gt; Costa's second work spans more than 200 pages. In the first part it develops his old "Objections", owing to Modena's responses and corrections. In the second part he adds his newer views that the [[Hebrew Bible]], especially the Torah, does not support the idea of [[immortality of the soul]]. Costa believed that this was not an idea deeply rooted in biblical Judaism, but rather had been formulated primarily by later [[Pharisees|Pharisaic]] rabbis, and promoted to a [[Jewish principles of faith]]. The work further pointed out the discrepancies between biblical Judaism and [[Rabbinic Judaism]]; he declared the latter to be an accumulation of mechanical [[ceremony|ceremonies]] and practices. In his view, it was thoroughly devoid of [[spirituality|spiritual]] and philosophical concepts.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}} Costa was relatively early in teaching to Jewish readership in favor of the mortality of the soul, and in appealing exclusively to direct reading of the bible. He cites neither rabbinic authorities nor philosophers of the Aristotelian and Neoplatonic traditions.&lt;ref&gt;Salomon &amp; Sassoon, introduction to da Costa's Examination of Pharisaic Traditions, 1993 [p. 47].&lt;/ref&gt;

The book became very controversial among [[Jews in Amsterdam|the local Jewish community]], whose leaders reported to the city authorities this was an attack on Christianity as well as on Judaism, and it was [[book burning|burned publicly]]. He was fined a significant sum. In 1627 Costa was a denizen of Utrecht. The Amsterdam community still had an uncomfortable relationship with him; they queried a Venetian rabbi, Yaakov Ha-Levi, whether his elderly mother is eligible for a burial lot in their city; the next year the mother died and Uriel went back to Amsterdam. Ultimately, the loneliness was too much for him to handle,&lt;ref&gt;Salomon &amp; Sassoon, introduction to da Costa's Examination of Pharisaic Traditions, 1993 [p. 18-24].&lt;/ref&gt; Around 1633 he accepted the terms of reconciliation, which he does not detail in his autobiography, and was reaccepted into the community.

Shortly after that Costa was tried again; he encountered two Christians who expressed to him their desire to convert to Judaism. In accordance with his views, he dissuaded them from doing so. Based on this and earlier accusations regarding [[kashrut]]'','' he was [[Herem (censure)|excommunicated]]. As he describes it, for seven years he lived in virtual isolation, shunned by his family and embroiled in civil-financial disputes with them. In search for legal help, he decided to go back being "an ape amongst the apes"; he would follow the traditions and practices, but with little real conviction. He sought a way of reconciliation. As a punishment for his heretical views, Costa was publicly given 39 [[Flagellation|lashes]] at the Portuguese [[synagogue]] in Amsterdam. He was then forced to lie on the floor while the congregation trampled over him. This left him both demoralized and seeking revenge against the man (a cousin or nephew) who brought about his trial, seven years previously.

The humiliating ceremony makes the final dramatic point of his autobiography. This document is a few pages long, and was transmitted to print in Latin some decades after his death, with the title ''Exemplar Humanae Vitae''. It tells the story of his life and intellectual development, his experience as a victim of [[Religious intolerance|intolerance]]. It also expresses [[rationalism|rationalistic]] and skeptical views: It doubts whether biblical law was divinely sanctioned or whether it was simply written down by [[Moses]]. It suggests that all [[religion]] was a human invention, and specifically rejects formalized, ritualized religion. It sketches a religion to be based only on [[natural law]], as god has no use for empty ceremony, nor for violence and strife.

Two reports agree that Costa committed suicide&lt;ref&gt;Salomon &amp; Sassoon, introduction to da Costa's Examination of Pharisaic Traditions, 1993 [p. 23].&lt;/ref&gt; in Amsterdam in 1640: [[:w:de:Johannes Müller (Pastor)|Johannes Müller]], a Protestant theologian of [[Hamburg]] gives the time as April, and Amsterdam [[Remonstrants|Remonstrat]] preacher [[Philipp van Limborch]] adds that he set out to end the lives of both his brother (or nephew) and himself. Seeing his relative approach one day, he grabbed a pistol and pulled the trigger, but it misfired. Then he reached for another, turned it on himself, and fired, dying a reportedly terrible death.

Ultimately there have been many ways to view Uriel da Costa. In his lifetime, his book ''Examinations'' inspired not only Silva's answer, but also [[Menasseh Ben Israel|Menasseh ben Israel]]'s more lasting ''De Resurrectione Mortuorum'' (1636) directed against the "Sadducees",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4v5wRSYnT0kC&amp;lpg=PA101&amp;dq=da%20costa%201636%20resurrection&amp;pg=PA101#v=onepage&amp;q=da%20costa%201636%20resurrection&amp;f=false|title=Menasseh Ben Israel and His World|last=van den Berg|first=Jan|date=1989|publisher=BRILL|year=|isbn=9004091149|location=|pages=101|language=en|chapter=Menasseh ben Israel, Henry More and Johannes Hoornbeeck on the Pre-existence of the Soul}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a listing in the [[Index Librorum Prohibitorum|Index of Prohibited Books]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T2riGg0gVxIC&amp;dq=&amp;pg=PA354#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Novus index librorum prohibitorum et expurgatorum|last=Zapata|first=Antonio|date=1632|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|language=la}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=DEN BOER|first=HARM|date=1989-01-01|title=WAS URIEL DA COSTA'S "EXAMEN" SEIZED BY THE SPANISH INQUISITION?

After his death, his name became synonymous with the ''Exemplar Humanae Vitae''.

Internally to Judaism, he was seen by many{{who|date=April 2017}} as both a troublemaking [[Heresy|heretic]] and [[martyr]] against the intolerance of the [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jewish]] establishment. He has also been seen as a precursor to [[Baruch Spinoza]] and of modern [[biblical criticism]].

Costa is also indicative of the difficulty that many ''[[Marrano]]s'' faced upon their arrival in an organized Jewish community. As a [[Crypto-Judaism|Crypto-Jew]] in [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberia]], he read the Bible and was impressed by it. Yet upon confronting an organized Rabbinic community, he was not equally impressed by the established ritual and religious doctrine of Rabbinical Judaism, such as the [[Oral Torah|Oral Law]].  As da Costa himself pointed out, traditional [[Pharisee]] and Rabbinic doctrine had been contested in the past by the [[Sadducees]] and the [[Karaite Judaism|Karaites]].

==Writings==
*[''Propositions against tradition''], ca. 1616. an untitled letter addressed at certain Rabbis, opposing their extra-biblical traditions.
*''Exame das tradições farisaicas'' (Portuguese for ''Examination of [[Pharisees|Pharisaic]] traditions''), 1623. Here, Costa argues that the human [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] is not [[Immortality|immortal]].
*''Exemplar humanae vitae'' ([[Latin]] for ''Example of a human life''), 1640. Costa's life, questions the authorship of Torah, and expresses trust in Natural law.

==Works based upon Costa's life==
* In 1846, in the midst of the [[liberalism|liberal]] milieu that led to the [[Revolutions of 1848]], the [[Germany|German]] writer [[Karl Gutzkow]] (1811–1878) wrote ''Uriel Acosta'', a play about Costa's life. This would later become the first classic play to be translated into [[Yiddish]], and it was a longtime standard of [[Yiddish theater]]; Uriel Acosta is the signature role of the actor Rafalesco, the protagonist of [[Sholem Aleichem]]'s ''[[Wandering Stars (novel)|Wandering Stars]]''. The first translation into Yiddish was by [[Osip Mikhailovich Lerner]], who staged the play at the [[Mariinski Theater]] in [[Odessa]], [[Ukraine]] (then part of [[Imperial Russia]]) in 1881, shortly after the assassination of [[Tsar]] [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]]. [[Abraham Goldfaden]] rapidly followed with a rival production, an [[operetta]], at Odessa's [[Remesleni Club]]. [[Israel Rosenberg]] promptly followed with his own translation for a production in [[Łódź]] (in modern-day [[Poland]]). Rosenberg's production starred [[Jacob Pavlovich Adler|Jacob Adler]] in the title role; the play would remain a signature piece in Adler's repertoire to the end of his stage career, the first of the several roles through which he developed the persona that he referred to as "the Grand Jew".
* [[Hermann Jellinek]] (brother of [[Adolf Jellinek]]) wrote a book entitled ''Uriel Acosta ''(1848).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/8582-jellinek#anchor6&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Israel Zangwill]] used the life of Uriel da Costa as one of several fictionalized biographies in his book "Dreamers of the Ghetto".
* Agustina Bessa-Luís, Portuguese writer  (1922- ) published in 1984 the novel " Um bicho da terra" based on Uriel's life.

'''Wasif Ali Wasif''' (15 January 1929 – 18 January 1993) was a teacher, writer, poet and [[sufi]] [[intellectual]] from [[Pakistan]]. He was the son of Muhammad Arif. Wasif Ali Wasif received his early education from Khushab before going to Jhang where he passed matriculation, intermediate and bachelor's in first division.

He was proficient at playing hockey and received many awards during his school and college time. After completing his bachelor's degree, he opted for English literature for his master's degree. Wasif started writing for the college magazine named "Ravi". He wrote on many topics. His two writings on the topics “College Miserable Life” and “Farewell Party” survive to this day.

He also passed the civil service exam but did not pursue it. In 1962 he established his own institute named "Lahore English College" near anarkali in Lahore.
Wasif had an interest in Sufism from his very childhood. He strived to meet sufis and visited different shrines.

He is famous for his literary works. He is said to have been cited in [[quotations]] more than any other contemporary [[Urdu]] writer. Master of [[aphorism]], he has downright a miraculous ability to capture a rainbow of meaning in a few dewdrops of well chosen words. Many of his aphorisms have become proverbs in recent years.  His  book "Kiran Kiran Suraj(کرن کرن سورج)" containing these aphorisms remained best seller for many many years. He used to write short essays on topics like love, life, fortune, fear, hope, expectation, promise, prayer, happiness, sorrow and so on with clear objective of highlighting the true spirit of Islam. He was a regular [[columnist]] of Pakistani Urdu daily newspaper ''[[Nawa-i-Waqt]]''. His column was named "GUFTGOO (گفتگو)" and it started publishing in newspaper in 1984. His shrine is in Lahore in the famous Mianiasaab graveyard where his Urs is celebrated on 22–24 Rajab annually.

'''Yerim Seowon''' is a former [[seowon]] in [[Miryang]], [[Gyeongsangnam-do]].  It is located in [[Bubuk-myeon]] on the slopes of [[Jongnamsan]], in the valley of the [[Miryang River]].

The Yerim Seowon was built in 1567 by [[Yi Do-u]] to enshrine [[Kim Jong-jik]], a Confucian scholar and politician who was native to Miryang.  At that time it bore the name "Deokseong Seowon."  Destroyed during [[Hideyoshi's invasions of Korea]] in the 1590s, it was rebuilt in 1606.  In 1669 it received a royal warrant.

The seowon, like most of those across Korea, was closed by order of the regent [[Daewon-gun]] in 1871.  However, beginning in 1874 local scholars once again began to gather there, although it no longer served as a school.  It continues in use as a shrine today, and was designated a tangible cultural treasure of Gyeongsangnam-do in 1974.
