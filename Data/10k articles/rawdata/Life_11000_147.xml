      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18202">'''Abd-Allah ibn Ubayy''' ({{lang-ar|عبد الله بن أبي بن سلول}}, died 631), also called '''ibn Salul''' in reference to his grandmother, was a chief of the [[Arab]] tribe [[Banu Khazraj]] and one of the leading men of [[Medina]] (then known as Yathrib). Upon the arrival of [[Muhammad]], Ibn Ubayy became a [[Muslim]], but the sincerity of his conversion is disputed.  Because of repeated conflicts with Muhammad, Islamic tradition has labelled him a ''[[Munafiq]]'' (hypocrite) and "leader of the Munafiqun".&lt;ref name="EoI-AiU"&gt;William Montgomery Watt, "`Abd Allah b. Ubayy", ''[[Encyclopaedia of Islam]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Position in Medina==

Abd-Allah was the son of Ubayy ibn Salul and Uzza bint Ka'ab, also from [[Banu Khazraj]]. His father's mother was called Salul. Ibn Ubayy was one of the chiefs of the Khazraj, who then were in conflict with the other major Arab tribe of the city, the [[Banu Aws]]. During the ''fidjar'', the so-called "sacrilegious war", Ibn Ubayy had led parts of the Khazraj tribe on the first day of fighting but held aloof on the second day. Also, he did not participate in the [[Battle of Bu'ath]] because of a quarrel with another leader over the execution of [[Jewish]] hostages.&lt;ref name="EoI-AiU"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Glubb 142"&gt;John Bagot Glubb, ''The Life and Times of Muhammad'' (2002), p. 142&lt;/ref&gt; It appears that at one point during the conflict, his life was saved by his Jewish allies from the tribe of [[Banu Qaynuqa]], as he would later exclaim: "300 soldiers armed in mail, and 400 unequipped, -- they defended me on the fields of Hadaick and Boath from every foe."&lt;ref name="Muir3-13"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Glubb 197"&gt;Glubb (2002), p. 197f.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ibn Ubayy "used every effort to end the fratricidal strife" &lt;ref name="Glubb 142"/&gt; and achieved a partial reconciliation between the two factions, which both recognized the leadership of Ibn Ubayy.&lt;ref name="Glubb 161"&gt;Glubb (2002), p. 161, 164f.&lt;/ref&gt;

He occupied a high status in pre-Islamic Medinan society, and his supporters aimed for him to become "king". The aim was not realized, however, because of the arrival of Muhammad in 622:&lt;ref name="EoI-AiU"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RM156"&gt;Maxime Rodinson, ''Muhammad: Prophet of Islam'' (2002), p. 156&lt;/ref&gt; since the tribal conflict had not been completely resolved, some citizens looked towards another arbitrator and called in Muhammad, whose preaching had made him famous beyond his home town of [[Mecca]].&lt;ref name="Glubb 161"/&gt;

The arrival of a man who claimed to speak in the name of God eclipsed Ibn Ubayy's influence. That provoked his jealousy, which he was careful to conceal, but was mitigated by his moderation and peacefulness. Ibn Ubayy nonetheless remained a well-respected man.&lt;ref name="Glubb 161"/&gt;
According to [[Ibn Ishaq]], Ibn Ubayy was "a man of great authority in Medina before the advent of the apostle" and "remained a continuing thorn in the flesh of his success".
&lt;ref name="Ibn Ishaq"&gt;Ibn Ishaq, ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20040625103910/http://www.hraic.org/hadith/ibn_ishaq.html#The%20earliest%20biography%20of%20Muhammad,%20by%20ibn%20Ishaq The earliest biography of Muhammad]´''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conversion==
After the entry of Muhammad in Medina, many of the Arabs converted to [[Islam]]. Ibn Ubayy followed suit, according to [[Maxime Rodinson]], as "he thought it wiser to join than to stand out against it".&lt;ref name="RM156"/&gt; However, [[Rudi Paret]] thinks it probable that he converted very soon after the [[Hijra (Islam)|Hijra]], at the same time as [[Sa'd ibn Mua'dh]].&lt;ref&gt;Rudi Paret, ''Mohammed und der Koran'', Stuttgart: Kohlhammer (1957), p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt; Islamic tradition, which views Ibn Ubayy's conversion as insincere, labelled him "leader of the hypocrites" (''munafiqun'').&lt;ref name="EoI-AiU"/&gt;&lt;ref name="M285"&gt;Saif-ur-Rahman al-Mubarakpuri, ''[[Ar-Raheeq Al-Makhtum]]'' (2002), p. 285&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="restatement"&gt;Sayed Ali Asgher Razwy, ''[http://al-islam.org/restatement/57.htm Restatement of History of Islam]''&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to Rodinson, Ibn Ubayy may have converted out of a "genuine sympathy with monotheist ideas fostered by his friendly relations with the Jews".&lt;ref&gt;Rodinson (2002), p. 157&lt;/ref&gt;

Being second only to Muhammad, Ibn Ubayy became a "figurehead for those Arabs of Medina who, openly or secretly, sneered at the Prophet's teaching and complained of the confusion and the danger which the coming of the Muslims had brought to Medina".&lt;ref name="Glubb 161"/&gt; Ibn Ishaq writes that some of the [[Ansar (Islam)|Ansar]] "were not altogether convinced of the political wisdom of supporting the apostle: these came to be regarded as paying lip-service to Islam, but hiding treachery in their hearts, and they were known and reviled as 'the Hypocrites'".&lt;ref name="Ibn Ishaq"/&gt; [[William Muir]] opines that tradition "makes a scapegoat of Abdallah" standing for "a great number, who had incurred Mahomet's anger, and some of them much more than Abdallah".&lt;ref name="Muir4-28"&gt;William Muir, ''[http://www.answering-islam.org.uk/Books/Muir/Life4/chap28.htm The Life of Mahomet], vol. 3, chapter 14&lt;/ref&gt;

==Military campaigns==

{{Main|List of expeditions of Muhammad}}

===Banu Qaynuqa===
{{Main|Invasion of Banu Qaynuqa}}
In 624, the Muslims moved against the Jewish tribe of the [[Banu Qaynuqa]]. According to [[Ibn Hisham]], a dispute had broken out between the Muslims and the Banu Qaynuqa, the allies of the [[Khazraj]] tribe. When a Muslim woman visited a jeweler's shop in the Qaynuqa marketplace, she was pestered to uncover her face. The goldsmith, a Jew, pinned her clothing such that upon getting up, she was unveiled. A Muslim man, coming upon the resulting commotion, killed the shopkeeper in retaliation and was in turn killed by Jews. As a result of the revenge killings, enmity grew between Muslims and the Banu Qaynuqa.&lt;ref name="Mubarakpuri 2005 284"&gt;{{citation |title=The sealed nectar: biography of the Noble Prophet|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r_80rJHIaOMC&amp;pg=PA284 | first=Saifur Rahman Al|last=Mubarakpuri|year=2005|publisher=Darussalam Publications | isbn= 978-9960-899-55-8| page= 284}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "Stillman"&gt;{{citation | last = Stillman | title = The Jews of Arab Lands: A History and Source Book}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp |122}}&lt;ref name= "Ishaq1"&gt;Guillaume 363, ibn Kathir 2&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Muslims besieged the Banu Qaynuqa, and after 15 days, forced them to surrender. Now, Ibn Ubayy was allied to the Qaynuqa and according to Muslim historians, appealed to Muhammad for leniency.&lt;ref name="EoI-AiU"/&gt; He grabbed hold of the top of Muhammad's breast plate as he turned away, provoking his anger.&lt;ref name="RM173"&gt;Rodinson (2002), p. 173&lt;/ref&gt; "Let me go," Muhammad said. Ibn Ubayy replied:
{{bquote|Nay [...] I will not let thee go, until thou hast compassion on my friends; 300 soldiers armed in mail, and 400 unequipped, - they defended me on the fields of Hadaick and Boath from every foe. Wilt thou cut them down in one day, O Mahomet? As for me, I am one verily that feareth the vicissitudes of fortune.&lt;ref name="Muir3-13"&gt;William Muir, ''[http://www.answering-islam.org.uk/Books/Muir/Life3/chap13.htm The Life of Mahomet], vol. 3, chapter 13&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Then, Muhammad acceded to his request and gave the Banu Qaynuqa three days to leave the city.&lt;ref name="RM173"/&gt;

Ibn Ubayy's last sentence has been interpreted in various ways. Rodinson considered it as threat against Muhammad,&lt;ref name="RM173"/&gt; [[William Montgomery Watt|Watt]] that Ibn Ubayy "urged their importance as a fighting unit in view of the expected Meccan onslaught".&lt;ref name="EoI-AiU"/&gt;

Muslims have traditionally seen the episode as another piece of evidence for Ibn Ubayy's hypocrisy since he insisted that adherence to Islam had not completely severed the old obligations of tribal and personal loyalty.&lt;ref&gt;Glubb (p. 197) refers to Ubada ibn al-Samit as an alternative; a Muslim from the tribe of Aws and also an ally of the Qunayqa, he then renounced his friendship the Jews.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Ibn Ubayy had not defended the Qaynuqa but merely pleaded for mercy. His plea implies that Muhammad intended to put the Qaynuqa to death, as he later did with the [[Banu Qurayza]], but after Ibn Ubayy's intercession, they were merely expelled from Medina, their property falling to Muhammad and the [[Muhajirun]].&lt;ref name="Glubb 197"/&gt;

===Battle of Uhud===
{{further|Battle of Uhud}}
In the consultations preceding the approaching [[Mecca]]n attack on Medina in 625, Ibn Ubayy had favored Muhammad's original plan to defend from the strongholds inside Medina itself:

{{bquote|...our city is a virgin, inviolate. We have never gone forth to our enemies, but we have suffered loss: remaining within our walls, we have beaten them off with slaughter. Leave the Coreish alone. If they remain, it will be in evil case; when they retire, it will be disappointed and frustrated in their designs.&lt;ref name="Muir3-14"&gt;William Muir, ''[http://www.answering-islam.org.uk/Books/Muir/Life3/chap14.htm The Life of Mahomet], vol. 3, chapter 14&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Some young Muslims, however, argued that the Meccans should be fought outside the city. Persuaded by the latter, Muhammad adopted an offensive strategy. According to Islamic tradition, Ibn Ubayy expressed his anger about his advice being rejected: "We do not know why we shall kill ourselves".&lt;ref&gt;al-Mubarakpuri (2002), p. 298&lt;/ref&gt;

When Muhammad marched out to fight the Meccans, Ibn Ubayy also marched out with 300 of his own men and his remaining Jewish allies, according to [[al-Waqidi]]; however, Muhammad ordered him to send the Jews back into the town, calling them "idolaters". Ibn Ubayy then led his men back to Medina, retiring to the strongholds, while Muhammad resumed his advance.&lt;ref name="EoI-AiU"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Muir3-14"/&gt; Islamic tradition presumes that Ibn Ubayy turned back to protect the town or his own possessions.&lt;ref name="Muir3-14"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Glubb 202"&gt;Glubb (2002), p. 202-205.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Watt, Surah {{cite quran|3|166|style=nosup|expand=no}} interprets Ibn Ubayy's withdrawal as showing "cowardice and lack of belief in God and the Prophet"&lt;ref name="EoI-AiU"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Some scholars interpret the Surah to indicate that Ibn Ubayy stayed in the town in the first place; A. Schaade, "`Abd-Allah b. Ubaiy", Enzyklopädie des Islam.&lt;/ref&gt;

Muhammad's 700 men met the 3000 of the Quraish in the [[Battle of Uhud]] and were defeated. The Quraish, however, did not succeed in killing Muhammad, and did occupy the town of Medina, possibly because they knew it was guarded by Ibn Ubayy.&lt;ref name="EoI-AiU"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Glubb 215"&gt;Glubb (2002), p. 215f.&lt;/ref&gt; Rodinson suggests that the Meccans did not want to reforge the very unity of the population, which had been jeopardised by Muhammad's defeat.&lt;ref&gt;Rodinson (2002), p. 182&lt;/ref&gt;

===Banu Nadir===
{{Main|Invasion of Banu Nadir}}
Ibn Ubay was also involved in Muhammad's conflict with another Jewish tribe, the [[Banu Nadir]]. Ibn Ishaq writes that when Muhammad ordered the tribe to leave the city within ten days, "certain persons of Medina who were not Believers sent a message to the Banu al-Nadir: 'Hold out, and defend yourselves; we shall not surrender you to Muhammad. If you are attacked we shall fight with you and if you are sent away we shall go with you'".&lt;ref name="Ibn Ishaq"/&gt; Other sources include or even identify the persons with the Muslim Ibn Ubayy. Waqidi reports that Ibn Ubayy, at first, strove to bring about a reconciliation, and [[Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari|Tabari]] relates that Abd-Allah accused Muhammad of treachery and urged the Nadir to resist by promising aid.&lt;ref name="Muir3-15"&gt;William Muir, ''[http://www.answering-islam.org.uk/Books/Muir/Life3/chap15.htm The Life of Mahomet], vol. 3, chapter 15.&lt;/ref&gt; However, as the promised help failed to materialize, the Nadir surrendered and Muhammad expelled them from the city.&lt;ref&gt;V. Vacca, "Nadir, Banu'l", ''[[Encyclopaedia of Islam]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jewenc"&gt;Hartwig Hirschfeld, "[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=192&amp;letter=A&amp;search=Banu%20Khazraja Abdallah ibn Ubaiy]", ''[[Jewish Encyclopedia]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Watt considered this to be the first instance in which Ibn Ubayy went beyond verbally criticizing Muhammad to intriguing against him, a practice Watt saw as continuing for the next two years.&lt;ref name="EoI-AiU"/&gt;

===Controversy during Mustaliq campaign===
{{Main|Invasion of Banu Mustaliq}}
In 627, Ibn Ubayy participated in a raid against the [[Banu Mustaliq]]. On the march home, conflict arose between the [[Muhajirun]] and the Ansar when a [[Bedouin]] servant of [[Umar]] pushed an ally of the Khazraj. Hearing of this, Ibn Ubayy reportedly voiced his discontent:

{{bquote|This... ye have brought upon yourselves, by inviting these strangers to dwell amongst us. When we return to Medina, the Mightier shall surely expel the Meaner!&lt;ref name="Muir3-16"/&gt;}}

Watt described the phrase as an attempt by Ibn Ubayy "to undermine Muhammad's authority and make men think of expelling him".&lt;ref name="EoI-AiU"/&gt; Muhammad forestalled any fighting by immediately continuing the march. Ibn Ubayy denied having said so and Muhammad accepted the excuse, but after their return to Medina, the "Munafiqun" would be reprimanded in Surah {{cite quran|63|8|style=nosup|expand=no}}. Reportedly, Muhammad rejected the advice of Umar, who counseled to have Ibn Ubayy killed and the offer of [[Abd-Allah ibn Abd-Allah ibn Ubayy|Ibn Ubayy's own son]], a fervent Muslim, to kill his own father.&lt;ref name="Muir3-16"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Akram Diya Al-Umari, ''[http://www.islaam.com/Article.aspx?id=423 The Bonds of Faith Are the Bases of the Links Between Men] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061018235017/http://www.islaam.com/Article.aspx?id=423 |date=October 18, 2006 }}'' (1991).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Glubb 262"&gt;Glubb (2002), p. 262f.&lt;/ref&gt;

Later during the march, Muhammad's wife [[Aisha#Aisha accused of adultery|Aisha]] was rumoured to have committed adultery, and Ibn Ubay was among those spreading the rumour.&lt;ref name="Muir3-16"/&gt;&lt;ref name="EoI-A"&gt;William Montgomery Watt, "Aisha bint Abi Bakr", ''[[Encyclopaedia of Islam]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Glubb 264"&gt;Glubb (2002), p. 264f.&lt;/ref&gt; 

One of the chiefs of the Aws asked for the permission to punish the slanderers without incurring a feud, but the Khazraj opposed that. After Muhammad had announced that he had received a revelation confirming Aisha's innocence, he had her three of her accusers, who had come forward, punished by eighty lashes. He did not venture to enforce the sentence against Ibn Ubayy, who had not come forward.&lt;ref name="Muir3-16"&gt;William Muir, ''[http://www.answering-islam.org.uk/Books/Muir/Life3/chap16.htm The Life of Mahomet], vol. 3, chapter 16&lt;/ref&gt;

==Last years==
According to Watt, after 627, there is no record of Ibn Ubayy "actively opposing Muhammad or intriguing against him". In 628, Ibn Ubayy participated in the march to [[Treaty of Hudaybiyyah|Hudaybiyya]].&lt;ref name="EoI-AiU"/&gt; According to Rudi Paret, Muhammad's "most dangerous rival" was now on Muhammad's side.&lt;ref&gt;Rudi Paret, ''Mohammed und der Koran'', Stuttgart: Kohlhammer (1957), p. 126.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 630, when Muhammad's launching a [[Battle of Tabouk|campaign]] against the [[Byzantine Empire]] during a time of drought and food shortage created serious discontent in Medina, Ibn Ubayy  expressed his sympathy for those criticizing the expedition as untimely. As the army assembled, Ibn Ubayy's troops formed a separate camp and turned back to Medina when Muhammad's forces set out.&lt;ref name="Glubb 333"&gt;Glubb (2002), p. 333f.&lt;/ref&gt; That possibly happened with Muhammad's consent because of Ibn Ubayy's ill health.&lt;ref name="EoI-AiU"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Muir4-28"/&gt; After Muhammad's return, those criticizing the campaign and had remained behind were chided in Surah {{cite quran|9|81|style=nosup|expand=no}}.&lt;ref name="Muir4-28"/&gt;

Ibn Ubayy died two months after Muhammad's return, in 631. Despite the various conflicts between the two men, Muhammad did not show signs of vindictiveness towards Ibn Ubayy and attended his funeral and prayed above his grave.&lt;ref name="restatement"/&gt; With Ibn Ubayy died the faction of the Munafiqun, as "there was no one left ... possessed of power or influence".&lt;ref name="Muir4-28"/&gt;

== Family==
{{refimprove|date=November 2018}}
Ibn Ubayy married three times and left behind nine children, all of whom became devout Muslims.&lt;ref name="EoI-AiU"/&gt; 

From his first wife, Khawla bint Mundhir ibn Haram of Banu Malik ibn al-Najjar:
*[[Abd-Allah ibn Abd-Allah ibn Ubayy|Hubab]], later known as Abd-Allah
*Jamila bint Abd-Allah ibn Ubayy
*Qays ibn Abd-Allah ibn Ubayy 

From his second wife, Rayta bint Amir ibn Qays of Banu Sa'id:
*Malika bint Abd-Allah ibn Ubayy
*Ubada ibn Abd-Allah ibn Ubayy
*Muhammad ibn Abd-Allah ibn Ubayy

From his third wife, Lubna bint Ubada bint Nadl of Banu Qauqal:
*Ramla bint Abd-Allah ibn Ubayy
*Sa'ida bint Abd-Allah ibn Ubayy
*Ma'mar ibn Abd-Allah ibn Ubayy

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3806">'''Publius Aelius Hadrianus Marullinus''' (c.31–c.91), also known as '''Aelius Hadrianus Marullinus''' or '''Aelius Marullinus''' was a [[Spain|Spanish]] [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[Roman Senate|Senator]] of Praetorian rank that lived during the [[Roman Empire]] in the 1st century.

== Family ==
Marullinus came from a well-established, wealthy and aristocratic family of [[Praetorian rank]] in the ''[[gens]] [[Aelia (gens)|Aelia]]''. His mother is unknown and his father was a Roman senator called Publius Aelius Hadrianus Marullinus, also the name of his paternal grandfather and great paternal grandfather. 

The paternal ancestors of Marullinus had descended from Picenum (modern [[Marche]] and [[Abruzzo]], [[Italy]]). They were originally [[Centurion]]s who participated in the [[Punic Wars]] possibly under the general [[Scipio Africanus]]. About 205 BC, at the end of the [[Second Punic War]], the paternal ancestors of Marullinus left Picenum and settled in [[Italica]] (near modern [[Seville]], [[Spain]]) in the Roman Province of [[Hispania Baetica]].

The paternal great-grandfather of Marullinus, ''Publius Aelius Hadrianus Marullinus'', was admitted into the [[Roman Senate]] by Octavian (future Emperor [[Augustus]]) when he served as a member of the [[Second Triumvirate]] between 43 BC–33 BC. He was the first person in his family to become a senator, however the circumstances leading him to be admitted into the senate are unknown. Nevertheless, Marullinus was one of the few Romans that came from the provinces that Octavian had never admitted into the Senate.

== History ==
Marullinus was born and raised in [[Italica]], but spent various amount of time in [[Rome]]. He married a noblewoman from Italica called [[Ulpia (grandmother of Hadrian)|Ulpia]], who was a sister to the Roman general and senator [[Marcus Ulpius Traianus (senior)|Marcus Ulpius Traianus]], the father of Emperor [[Trajan]].

Ulpia and Marullinus had at least one child, a son called [[Publius Aelius Hadrianus Afer]], who would become a distinct soldier and politician. Hadrianus Afer would marry [[Domitia Paulina]] and would have two children: [[Aelia Domitia Paulina]] (75–130) and [[Hadrian|Publius Aelius Hadrianus]] (76–138). Hadrianus [[Adoption in Ancient Rome|was adopted]] by Trajan as his heir and eventually succeeded him as Emperor [[Hadrian]].

Marullinus had a reputation in practising [[astrology]] and had predicted by the stars, that his grandson would rule as Roman Emperor.

When Hadrian ruled as Roman Emperor, as a tribute to his birthplace and ancestry he created Hispania Baetica into a colony. Hadrian's second adoptive son and successor [[Antoninus Pius]], assumed the name ''Aelius Hadrianus'', as a part of his name when he ruled as Emperor and sixth child born to Roman Emperor [[Marcus Aurelius]] and Roman Empress [[Faustina the Younger]] was named ''Hadrianus''. The prince ''Hadrianus'' (152–157) was named in honor of his grandson Hadrian and is a tribute to his family.

'''Alexander Ivanovich Greba '''(born September 23, 1980 in Moshchenoe, [[Belgorod Oblast]], [[RSFSR]]), known as "'''The Goblin'''", is a [[Russia|Russian]] [[serial killer]]. In March 2005, he was sentenced to [[life imprisonment]] for several murders.

== Biography ==
Greba was born on September 23, 1980 in Moshchenoe, in the [[Yakovlevsky District, Belgorod Oblast|Yakovlevsky District]]. Alexander's parents divorced when he was barely 2 years old, as his father could not stand tolerating his wife. The mother drank, led a riotous life, stole from home and was hysterical. After the first divorce, she remarried, but the second husband soon abandoned her as well. After that, she took out her anger on her children, especially on Alexander. The family struggled to make ends meet, so from the age of 10, Alexander began to steal. After growing up, he fled to the forest, where he lived.

At the age of 16 he was convicted of murder. On that day, it beginning to get cold, and Greba had to leave the forest. He made his way into a coop, and when the landlady entered, he killed her, because she resembled his mother. Greba was caught at the crime scene and sentenced to 8 years and 10 months imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://vsrf.ru/stor_pdf.php?id=116948|title=Кассационное определение по делу Гребы А.И.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;In April 2004, he was released on [[parole]].

'''''Anna''''' was launched at Bombay in 1790. She was often called '''''Bombay Anna''''' to distinguish her from ''Bengal'' {{ship||Anna|1793 ship|2}}. ''Bombay Anna'' made two voyages for the British [[East India Company]] (EIC). She was lost at sea in 1816.

==Career==
''Anna'' first appeared in ''[[Lloyd's Register]]'' for 1797 (published in 1796), with M. Gilmore, master, changing to J. Horne, Law &amp; Co., owner, and trade London–East Indies. The entry noted that she had been built in 1788 of teak in the East Indies.&lt;ref name=LR1797&gt;[https://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015004281278?urlappend=%3Bseq=26 ''Lloyd's Register'' (1797), Seq.№417.]&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1796 she carried rice from Bengal to Britain on behalf of the British government which was importing grain to address high prices for wheat in Britain following a poor harvest.

{{See also|Transport vessels for the British Government's importation of rice from Bengal (1795–1796)}}

''Anna'' was admitted to the Registry of Great Britain on 24 November 1796.&lt;ref name=Select&gt;Select... (1814), p.86.&lt;/ref&gt; The next day Captain John Horn acquired a [[letter of marque]].&lt;ref name=LoM/&gt;

On 31 July 1797 ''Bengal Anna'', ''Bombay Anna'', and {{ship||Coromandel|1793 ship|2}} arrived in Portsmouth with invalids and prisoners from the West Indies. They had made a rapid voyage of about a month.&lt;ref&gt;[http://find.galegroup.com/ttda/infomark.do?&amp;source=gale&amp;prodId=TTDA&amp;userGroupName=upenn_main&amp;tabID=T003&amp;docPage=article&amp;searchType=AdvancedSearchForm&amp;docId=CS50469122&amp;type=multipage&amp;contentSet=LTO&amp;version=1.0] "Ship News." ''Times'' [London, England] 2 Aug. 1797.&lt;/ref&gt; The vessels may have gone out to the West Indies in connection with Admiral Sir [[Hugh Cloberry Christian]]'s expedition to the West Indies, thought they are not listed amongst the vessels that left on 24 January 1796.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.1812privateers.org/LLOYDS/1796/02-02-1796.jpg ''[[Lloyd's List]]'' №2790.]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 November 1798 Captain James Horsburgh sailed from China, bound for England. ''Anna'' left [[Whampoa Anchorage]] on 20 November 1798 and was at [[Nei Lingding Island|Lintin]] on 7 February 1799. She reached Malacca on 22 February and [[Saint Helena|St Helena]] on 8 May; she arrived at Long Reach on 17 July.&lt;ref name=BL&gt;[http://searcharchives.bl.uk/IAMS_VU2:IAMS045-001114537 British Library: ''Anna'' (3).]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 December 1799 ''Bengal Anna'' and ''Bombay Anna'' were at Madeira taking on wine. They were in company with ''Calcutta'', which shortly thereafter was captured and recaptured. They had sailed from Spithead on 20 November.&lt;ref &gt;''Naval Chronicle'', Vol. 3, p.79.&lt;/ref&gt;  One report has her in the [[Red Sea]] as one of the many transports supporting [[Sir David Baird, 1st Baronet|General]] Baird's expedition to help General [[Ralph Abercromby]] expel the [[France|French]] from Egypt.&lt;ref name=Select/&gt;

Captain James Horsburgh sailed from Bombay on 6 May 1801, bound for England. ''Anna'' reached St Helena on 26 August and arrived at [[The Downs (ship anchorage)|The Downs]] 30 October.&lt;ref name=BL/&gt;

She then made voyages to China in 1802, 1805, 1806, and 1807. On the voyage in 1804 she carried opium.&lt;ref&gt;Bulley (2000), p.151.&lt;/ref&gt; From 1807 to 1808 her captain was F. Smith.&lt;ref name=Bulley/&gt;

In the summer of 1810 the Royal Navy took up ''Anna'' as a transport. The navy detached ''Anna'' and ''Minerva'', and two Calcutta ships, ''Oxford'' and [[Lucy Maria (1801 ship)|''Troubridge'']] from the rest of the transports and sent the four to the Cape of Good Hope to gather reinforcements. The governor there, Lord [[Du Pre Alexander, 2nd Earl of Caledon|Caledon]], delayed their departure. They were armed and received a naval officer to command them. (They may thereafter have been styled briefly as HM [[Hired armed vessels|hired armed ships]].) They arrived at Mauritius too late to participate in the [[Invasion of Île de France]] in December.&lt;ref&gt;Bulley (2000), p.69.&lt;/ref&gt; Lieutenant Bertie Cator was appointed to command ''Anna''. He moved from temporary command of {{HMS|Otter|1805|6}} and by some accounts commanded ''Anna'' during the Invasion. He then became (acting) commander of {{HMS|Acteon|1805|6}}, which he sailed back to England with duplicate dispatches.&lt;ref&gt;''The Gentleman's Magazine, and Historical Chronicle, for the Year 1864'', Vol. 217 (September), p.394.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|In 1816 the Admiralty paid prize money for the campaign, and the Invasion. A first-class share, that of a captain or commander, was worth [[£sd|£]]153 5[[shilling|s]] 5½[[pence|d]]. A second-class share, that of a lieutenant, was worth £29 2s 5¼d. It is not clear whether Cator qualified for a first-class share as commander of ''Anna'', despite being a lieutenant. A sixth-class share, that of an ordinary seaman, was worth £1 18s 0¾d.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|date=2 March 1816|issue=17115|page=410}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1828 there was a fourth and final payment.

A sixth-class share was worth 8s 2½d.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|date=15 July 1828|issue=18487|page=1377}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}} 

Captain Jonathon Tate commanded ''Anna'' between 1811 and 1816. She made a voyage to Mauritius in 1811.&lt;ref name=Bulley/&gt;

''Anna'' served as a transport ship during the British [[Invasion of Java (1811)|invasion of Java]] in 1811.&lt;ref&gt;Select... (1814), p.656.&lt;/ref&gt; She was part of the second division, which sailed from Malacca on 11 June 1811.&lt;ref&gt;''Naval Chronicle'', Vol. 27, (Jan-Jun 1812), p.109.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Transport vessels for the British invasion of Java (1811)}}

On 4 July 1812 ''Anna'' was at [[Penang Island|Prince of Wales' Island]] when a fire broke out on shore. She was among the many vessels, Navy and merchant, that contributed men to fight the fire.&lt;ref&gt;''Literary Panorama'', Vol. 13, p.1002.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1812, 1814, and 1816 ''Anna'' again sailed to China. In 1814, for instance, she carried 14,495 piculs of cotton to China.&lt;ref name=Bulley/&gt;

==Fate==
Captain Jonathon Read commanded ''Anna'' in 1816.&lt;ref name=Bulley/&gt; ''Anna'' was lost at sea in 1816,&lt;ref name=Hackman/&gt; or 1817.

The '''arapaima''', '''pirarucu''', or '''paiche''' are any large species of [[bonytongue]] in the genus '''''Arapaima''''' native to the [[Amazon Basin|Amazon]] and [[Essequibo River|Essequibo]] basins of South America.  Genus ''Arapaima'' is the [[type genus]] of the family [[Arapaimidae]].&lt;ref name=FishBase/&gt;&lt;ref name=CastelloStewart&gt;Castello, L.; and Stewart, D.J (2008).

These fish are widely dispersed and do not migrate, which leads scientists to suppose that more species are waiting to be discovered among the depths of the Amazon Basin harbors. Sites such as these offer the likelihood of diversity.&lt;ref&gt;Arantes, Caroline C., Leandro Castello, Mauricio Cetra, and Ana Schilling. "Environmental 
Influences on the Distribution of Arapaima in Amazon Floodplains." Environmental

==Morphology==
[[Image:Arapaima leptosoma 2009 G2.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Arapaima leptosoma]]'' shown at its full length]]
Arapaima can reach lengths of more than {{convert|2|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, in some exceptional cases even more than {{convert|2.5|m|ftin|abbr=on}} and over {{convert |100|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. The maximum recorded weight for the species is {{convert|200|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, while the longest recorded length was 4.52&amp;nbsp;m (15&amp;nbsp;ft). As a result of overfishing, large arapaima of more than {{convert|2|m|ftin|abbr=on}} are seldom found in the wild.

The arapaima is [[torpedo]]-shaped with large blackish-green scales and red markings. It is streamlined and sleek, with its [[dorsal fin|dorsal]] and [[anal fin]] set near its tail.

Arapaima scales have a mineralised, hard, outer layer with a corrugated surface under which lie several layers of [[collagen]] fibres in a [[Bouligand Structure|''Bouligand'']]-type arrangement.&lt;ref name="Sherman 2016"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Sherman |first=Vincent R. |title=A comparative study of piscine defense: The scales of Arapaima gigas, Latimeria chalumnae and Atractosteus spatula |journal=Journal of the Mechanical Behavior of Biomedical Materials |year=2016 |doi=10.1016/j.jmbbm.2016.10.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Engineers Find Inspiration for New Materials in Piranha-proof Armor|url=http://www.jacobsschool.ucsd.edu/news/news_releases/release.sfe?id=1151|publisher=Jacobs School of Engineering, UC San Diego|accessdate=8 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a structure similar to plywood, the fibres in each successive layer are oriented at large angles to those in the previous layer, increasing toughness. The hard, corrugated surface of the outer layer, and the tough internal collagen layers work synergistically to contribute to their ability to flex and deform while providing strength and protection—a solution that allows the fish to remain mobile while heavily armored.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Sherman |first=Vincent R. |title=The materials science of collagen |journal=Journal of the Mechanical Behavior of Biomedical Materials |volume=52 |pages=22–50 |year=2015 |doi=10.1016/j.jmbbm.2015.05.023 |pmid=26144973}}&lt;/ref&gt; The arapaima has a fundamental dependence on surface air to breathe. In addition to gills, it has a modified and enlarged [[swim bladder]], composed of [[lung]]-like tissue, which enables it to extract oxygen from the air.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arkive.org/arapaima/arapaima-gigas/#speciesFactFile|title=Arapaima videos, photos and facts - Arapaima gigas - ARKive|work=arkive.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ecology==
The diet of the arapaima consists of fish, [[crustacean]]s and small land animals that walk near the shore.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} The fish is an [[Fish#Respiration|air-breather]], using its [[labyrinth organ]], which is rich in blood vessels and opens into the fish's mouth,&lt;ref name=Ferraris&gt;{{cite book| author = Ferraris, C.J. | year = 2003 | chapter = Family Arapaimatidae | editor = Reis, R.E. |editor2=Kullander, S.O. |editor3=Ferraris, C.J. | title = Check List of the Freshwater Fishes of South and Central America | pages = 582–588 | publisher = EDIPUCRS | location = Porto Alegre, Brazil}}&lt;/ref&gt; an advantage in oxygen-deprived water that is often found in the [[Amazon River]]. This fish is able to survive in [[oxbow lake]]s with dissolved oxygen as low as 0.5 ppm. In the [[wetlands]] of the [[Araguaia River|Araguaia]], one of the most important refuges for this species, it is the top [[predation|predator]] in such lakes during the low water season, when the lakes are isolated from the rivers and oxygen levels drop, rendering its prey lethargic and vulnerable.

Arapaimas may leap out of the water if they feel constrained by their environment or harassed.

==Life history/behavior==
===Reproduction===
Due to its geographic [[range (biology)|range]]s, arapaima's life cycle is greatly affected by seasonal [[flood]]ing. Various pictures show slightly different coloring owing to colour changes when they reproduce.&lt;ref&gt;"Fish Warrior: Amazon Giant." http://natgeotv.com/. National Geographic. Web. 
&lt;http://natgeotv.com/ca/fish-warrior/facts&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; The arapaima lays its [[egg (biology)|eggs]] during the months when water levels are low or beginning to rise. They build a nest about {{convert|50|cm}} wide and {{convert|15|cm}} deep, usually in muddy-bottomed areas. As the water rises, the eggs hatch and the offspring have the flood season during May to August to prosper such that yearly spawning is regulated seasonally.

=== Breeding ===
The arapaima male is a [[mouthbreeder]], like his relative, the ''[[Osteoglossum]]'', meaning the young are protected in his mouth until they are older. The female arapaima helps to protect the male and the young by circling them and fending off potential predators.

In his book ''Three Singles to Adventure'', naturalist [[Gerald Durrell]] reported that in British Guiana, female arapaima had been seen secreting a white substance from a gland in the head and that their young were seemingly feeding on the substance.

==Evolution==
[[Fossils]] of arapaima or a very similar species have been found in the [[Miocene]] Villavieja Formation of [[Colombia]]&lt;ref name=Lundberg&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Lundberg, J.G.  |author2=B.

"Environmental Influences on the Distribution of Arapaima in Amazon Floodplains." Environmental Biology of Fishes (2011): 1257-267. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relation to humans==
[[File:Arapaima gigas scales 3860.jpg|thumb|right|Closeup of scales|274x274px]][[File:Arapaima close-up.jpg|thumb|Arapaima or Pirarucu close-up|271x271px]]Arapaima is used in many ways by local human populations.

It is considered an [[aquarium]] fish, one that requires substantial space and food.

Its [[tongue]] is thought to have medicinal qualities in South America. It is dried and combined with [[guarana]] bark, which is grated and mixed into water. Doses are given to kill [[intestinal worms]].

The bony tongue is used to scrape cylinders of dried [[guarana]], an ingredient in some beverages, and the bony scales are used as nail files.

Arapaima produces boneless steaks and is considered a delicacy. In the Amazon region locals often salt and dry the meat, rolling it into a cigar-style package that is then tied and can be stored without rotting, which is important in a region with little refrigeration. Arapaimas are referred to as the "cod of the Amazon", and can be prepared in the same way as traditional salted cod.

In July 2009, villagers around [[Kenyir Lake]] in [[Terengganu]], Malaysia, reported sighting ''A. gigas''. The "Kenyir monster", or "dragon fish" as the locals call it, was claimed to be responsible for the mysterious drowning of two men on 17{{nbsp}}June.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thestar.com.my/metro/story.asp?file=/2009/7/8/southneast/4215888&amp;sec=southneast|title=Archives|work=thestar.com.my}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fishing===
[[File:F de Castelnau-poissonsPl25.jpg|thumb|right|Skull from side and above]]

Fishing is allowed only in certain remote areas of the [[Amazon basin]], and must either be [[catch-and-release]] or subsistence harvesting by native peoples.

Some 7000 tons per year were taken from 1918 to 1924, the height of its commercial fishing. Demand led to farming of the fish by the ''ribeirinhos'' (people living on riverbanks).&lt;ref&gt;''[[River Monsters]]'' episode name: "Unhooked", Animal Planet, 16 July 2010 10AM PDT.&lt;/ref&gt;

They are [[harpoon]]ed or caught in large nets. Since the arapaima needs to surface to breathe air, traditional arapaima fishermen harpoon them and then club them to death. An individual fish can yield as much as {{convert|70|kg}} of meat.

The arapaima was introduced for fishing in [[Thailand]] and [[Malaysia]]. Fishing in Thailand can be done in several lakes, where specimens over {{convert|150|kg}} are often landed and then released.

With catch-and-release after the fish is landed, it must be held for five minutes until it takes a breath. The fish has a large blood vessel running down its spine and lifting the fish clear of the water for trophy shots can rupture this vessel, causing death.

=== Aquaculture ===
In 2013 [[Whole Foods]] began selling [[Aquaculture|farm-raised]] arapaima in the United States as a cheaper alternative to [[halibut]] or [[Patagonian toothfish|Chilean sea bass]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Saving an Endangered Fish by Eating More of It - BusinessWeek Education Resource Center|url = http://resourcecenter.businessweek.com/reviews/saving-an-endangered-fish-by-eating-more-of-it1|website = resourcecenter.businessweek.com|accessdate = 2015-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Thailand there is only one legal breeding farm located in Tambon Phrong Maduea, [[Amphoe Mueang Nakhon Pathom]], [[Nakhon Pathom Province]]. This has been approved by both the Department of Fisheries and [[CITES]] since early 2018, and has been exported to worldwide as an aquarium fish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.technologychaoban.com/pet/article_54255|title=ศิริวรรณ อะราไพม่า ฟาร์มนครปฐม เพาะเลี้ยงปลาช่อนอะเมซอนส่งขายทั่วโลก ได้เพียงที่เดียวในประเทศ|language=thai|date=2018-04-07|first=ธาวิดา|last= ศิริสัมพันธ์|work=Technology Chaoban Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Status==
=== Conservation ===
The status of the arapaima population in the Amazon River Basin is unknown, hence it is listed on the [[IUCN red list]] as Data Deficient. It is difficult to conduct a population census in so large an area, and it is problematic to monitor catches in a trade that is largely illegal. Commercial arapaima fishing is banned by the [[Brazil]]ian government due to its [[extinction|commercial extinction]].{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} [[Colombia]] bans the fishing and consumption of the arapaima between October 1 and March 15 as it's within the seasons that the fish breeds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ica.gov.co/getdoc/a7e40c46-1243-45a9-80d4-c52097320b2b/vedas.aspx|title=Vedas|author=|date=|website=ica.gov.co|accessdate=22 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- clarify There is a scope for captive breeding and reintroduction to the wild in effort to increase the population. --&gt;

=== Threats ===
A 2014 study found that the fish was depleted or [[overexploited]] at 93% of the sites examined and well-managed or unfished in only 7%; the fish appeared to be [[Local extinction|extirpated]] in 19% of these sites.&lt;ref name = "Castello2014"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Castello | first1 = L. | last2 = Arantes | first2 = C.

'''Artur de Sacadura Freire Cabral''', [[Order of the Tower and Sword|GCTE]] (23 May 1881 &amp;ndash; 15 November 1924), known simply as '''Sacadura Cabral''' ({{IPA-pt|sɐkɐˈduɾɐ kɐˈbɾaɫ}}), was a Portuguese [[aviation]] pioneer. He, together with fellow aviator [[Gago Coutinho]], conducted [[first aerial crossing of the South Atlantic|the first flight across the South Atlantic Ocean]] in 1922, and also the first using only astronomical navigation, from [[Lisbon]], [[Portugal]], to [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Brazil]]. On 15 November 1924, he [[List of previously missing aircraft|disappeared while flying]] over the [[English Channel]], along with his co-pilot, Mechanical Corporal José Correia, due to fog and his shortening eyesight (which never kept him from flying). Although some mechanical wreckage from his seaplane had been discovered four days later, the bodies were never recovered.

The '''Battle of Blair Mountain''' was the largest labor uprising in [[United States history]] and one of the largest, best-organized, and most well-armed uprisings since the [[American Civil War]].{{sfn|Kinder|2005|p=149}}  

The conflict occurred in [[Logan County, West Virginia|Logan County]], [[West Virginia]], as part of the [[Coal Wars]], a series of early-20th-century labor disputes in Appalachia. Tensions rose between workers and mine management, and for five days from late August to early September 1921, some 10,000 armed [[coal miner]]s confronted 3,000 lawmen and [[strikebreakers]], called the Logan Defenders,{{sfn|Patel|2012|p=}} who were backed by coal mine operators during the miners' attempt to [[Trade union|unionize]] the southwestern West Virginia coalfields. The battle ended after approximately one million rounds were fired&lt;ref&gt;Ayers, Rothrock and King 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[United States Army]] intervened by presidential order.&lt;ref&gt;[[:s:Proclamation 1606|Proclamation 1606]], August 30, 1921&lt;/ref&gt; Up to 100 people were killed, and many more arrested. The [[United Mine Workers]] saw major declines in membership, but the long-term publicity led to some improvements in working conditions.

== Background ==
[[File:Child Labor in United States, coal mines Pennsylvania.jpg|thumb|Child labor in American coal mines, Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, 1906.]]
{{See also|Coal Wars}}

On May 19, 1920, 12 [[Baldwin-Felts]] agents, including Lee Felts, arrived in [[Matewan, West Virginia]] and promptly met with Albert Felts, who was already in the area. Albert and Lee were the brothers of Thomas Felts, the co-owner and director of the agency. Albert had already been in the area and had tried to bribe Mayor Testerman with $500 to place machine guns on roofs in the town; Testerman refused.{{sfn|Savage|1990|p=16}} That afternoon Albert and Lee along with 11 other men set out to the Stone Mountain Coal Co. property. The first family they evicted was a woman and her children; the woman's husband was not home at the time. They forced them out at gunpoint and threw their belongings in the road under a light but steady rain. The miners who saw it were furious, and sent word to town.{{sfn|Savage|1990|pp=20–22}}&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Sidhatfield.jpg|thumb|[[Sid Hatfield]]]] --&gt;

As the agents walked to the train station to leave town, Police Chief [[Sid Hatfield]] and a group of deputized miners confronted them and told them they were under arrest. Albert Felts replied that in fact he had a warrant for Hatfield's arrest.{{sfn|Savage|1990|p=21}} Testerman was alerted, and he ran out into the street after a miner shouted that Sid had been arrested. Hatfield backed into the store and Testerman asked to see the warrant. After reviewing it, the mayor exclaimed, "This is a bogus warrant." With these words, a gunfight erupted and Hatfield shot Albert Felts. Testerman and Albert and Lee Felts were among the ten men killed (three from the town and seven from the agency).{{sfn|Savage|1990|p=21}}

This gunfight became known as the [[Matewan Massacre]], and its symbolic significance was enormous for the miners. The seemingly invincible Baldwin-Felts had been beaten.{{sfn|Savage|1990|p=26}} Sid Hatfield became an immediate legend and hero to the union miners, and a symbol of hope that the oppression of coal operators and their hired guns could be overthrown.{{sfn|Savage|1990|p=28}} Throughout the summer and into the fall of 1920 the union gained strength in [[Mingo County, West Virginia|Mingo County]], as did the resistance of the coal operators. Low-intensity warfare was waged up and down the [[Tug Fork|Tug River]]. In late June state police under the command of Captain Brockus raided the Lick Creek tent colony near Williamson. Miners were said to have fired on Brockus and Martin's men from the colony, and in response the state police shot and arrested miners, ripped the canvas tents to shreds and scattered the mining families' belongings.{{sfn|Savage|1990|p=60}} Both sides were bolstering their arms, and Sid Hatfield continued to be a problem, especially when he converted Testerman's jewelry store into a gun shop.{{sfn|Savage|1990|p=50}}

On January 26, 1921, the trial of Hatfield for killing Albert Felts began. It was in the national spotlight and brought much attention to the miners' cause. Hatfield's stature and mythical status grew as the trial proceeded. He posed and talked to reporters, fanning the flames of his own legend. All men were acquitted in the end, but overall the union was facing significant setbacks.{{sfn|Shogan|2004|p=98}} Eighty percent of mines had reopened with the importation of replacements and the signing of [[yellow-dog contracts]] by ex-strikers returning to the mines.{{sfn|Shogan|2004|p=81}} In mid-May 1921 union miners launched a full-scale assault on non-union mines. In a short time the conflict had consumed the entire Tug River Valley. This "Three Days Battle" was finally ended by a flag of truce and the implementation of martial law.{{sfn|Savage|1990|p=53}} From the beginning, the miners perceived the enforcement of martial law as one-sided.{{sfn|Savage|1990|p=57}} Hundreds of miners were arrested; the smallest of infractions could mean imprisonment, while those on the side of "law and order" were seen as immune.{{sfn|Savage|1990|p=58}} The miners responded with guerrilla tactics and violence.{{sfn|Savage|1990|p=58}}

In the midst of this tense situation, Hatfield traveled to [[McDowell County, West Virginia|McDowell County]] on 1 August 1921 to stand trial on charges of dynamiting a [[Tipple|coal tipple]]. Along with him traveled a good friend, Ed Chambers, and their wives.{{sfn|Shogan|2004|pp=154–156}} As they walked up the courthouse stairs, unarmed and flanked by their wives, a group of Baldwin-Felts agents standing at the top of the stairs opened fire. Hatfield was killed instantly. Chambers was bullet-riddled and rolled to the bottom of the stairs. Despite Sally Chambers' protests, one of the agents ran down the stairs and shot Chambers once more,-point blank in the back of the head.{{sfn|Shogan|2004|pp=157–158}} Hatfield's and Chambers' bodies were returned to Matewan, and word of the slayings spread through the mountains.

The miners were angry at the way Hatfield had been slain, and that it appeared the assassins would escape punishment.{{sfn|Savage|1990|p=73}} They began to pour out of the mountains and take up arms.

Miners along the [[Coal River (West Virginia)|Little Coal River]] were among the first to militarize, and began actions such as patrolling and guarding the area. Sheriff Don Chafin sent [[Logan County, West Virginia|Logan County]] troopers to the Little Coal River area, where armed miners captured the troopers, disarmed them and sent them fleeing.{{sfn|Savage|1990|p=75}}

On August 7, 1921, the leaders of the [[United Mine Workers]] (UMW) District 17, which encompasses much of southern West Virginia, called a rally at the state capitol in Charleston. These leaders were [[Frank Keeney]] and Fred Mooney, who were veterans of previous [[West Virginia coal wars|mine conflicts in the region]]. Both were local, well-read and articulate. Keeney and Mooney met with [[Ephraim F. Morgan|Governor Ephraim Morgan]] and presented him with a petition of the miners' demands.{{sfn|Shogan|2004|pp=164–165}}  When Morgan summarily rejected the demands, the miners became more restless and began to talk of a march on Mingo to free the confined miners, end martial law and organize the county. But Blair Mountain, Logan County, and Sheriff Chafin stood directly in the way.{{sfn|Shogan|2004|p=166}}

At a rally on August 7, [[Mary Harris Jones|Mary Harris "Mother" Jones]] called on the miners not to march into Logan and Mingo counties and set up the union by force. Accused by some of losing her nerve, she feared a bloodbath in a battle between lightly armed union forces and the more heavily armed Logan County deputies. Yet, feeling Morgan had lied to them again, armed men began gathering at Lens Creek Mountain, near [[Marmet, West Virginia|Marmet]] in [[Kanawha County]], on August 20. Four days later an estimated 13,000 had gathered and began marching towards Logan County. Impatient to get to the fighting, miners near St. Albans, in Kanawha County, commandeered a Chesapeake and Ohio freight train, renamed by the miners the Blue Steel Special, to meet up with the advanced column of marchers at Danville in [[Boone County, West Virginia|Boone County]] on their way to ''Bloody Mingo''. During this time Keeney and Mooney fled to Ohio, while the fiery [[Bill Blizzard]] assumed quasi-leadership of the miners. Meanwhile, the anti-union Sheriff Chafin&lt;ref&gt;[[The Herald-Dispatch]]: ''[http://www.wvculture.org/History/government/chafindon01.html Funeral Rites Thursday For Colorful Don Chafin].'' August 10, 1954&lt;/ref&gt; had begun to set up defenses on Blair Mountain. He was supported financially by the Logan County Coal Operators Association, creating the nation's largest private armed force of nearly 2,000.

The first skirmishes occurred on the morning of August 25. The bulk of the miners were still {{convert|15|mi|km|abbr=on}} away.

The following day, President [[Warren Harding]] threatened to send in federal troops and Army [[Martin MB-1]] bombers. After a long meeting in Madison, the seat of Boone County, the miners were convinced to return home. But the struggle was far from over. After spending days assembling his private army, Chafin would not be denied his battle to end union attempts at organizing Logan County coal mines. Within hours of the Madison decision, rumors abounded that Chafin's men had shot union sympathizers in the town of [[Sharples, West Virginia|Sharples]], just north of Blair Mountain—and that families had been caught in crossfire during the skirmishes. Infuriated, the miners turned back toward Blair Mountain, many traveling in other stolen and commandeered trains.
[[File:Miners with bomb.jpg|thumb|200px|A group of miners display one of the bombs dropped by Chafin's airplanes.]]

By August 29 battle was fully joined. Chafin's men, though outnumbered, had the advantage of higher positions and better weaponry. Private planes were hired to drop homemade bombs on the miners. A combination of gas and explosive bombs left over from World War I were dropped in several locations near the towns of Jeffery, Sharples and Blair. At least one did not explode and was recovered by the miners; it was used months later to great effect during treason and murder trials. On orders from General [[Billy Mitchell]], Army bombers from Maryland were also used for aerial surveillance. One Martin bomber crashed on its return flight, killing the three crew members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Laurie |first1=Clayton D. |last2= |first2= |year=1991 |title=The United States Army and the Return to Normalcy in Labor Dispute Interventions: The Case of the West Virginia Coal Mine Wars, 1920–1921 |journal=West Virginia History |volume=50 |issue= |pages=1–24 |publisher=West Virginia Archives and History |doi= |url=http://www.wvculture.org/history/journal_wvh/wvh50-1.html |accessdate=18 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Torok|2004|p=48}}

On August 30, Morgan appointed Colonel William Eubanks of the [[West Virginia National Guard]] to command the government and volunteer forces confronting the miners.&lt;ref&gt;The Battle of Blair Mountain: The Story of America's Largest Labor Uprising
By Robert Shogan p.193&lt;/ref&gt; Sporadic gun battles continued for a week, with the miners at one time nearly breaking through to the town of Logan and their target destinations, the non-unionized counties to the south, Logan and Mingo. Up to 30 deaths were reported by Chafin's side and 50–100 on the union miners' side, with hundreds more injured or wounded.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}} Chafin's forces consisted of 90 men from [[Bluefield, West Virginia]]; 40 from [[Huntington, West Virginia]]; and about 120 from the [[West Virginia State Police]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=EQQ9AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA268&amp;dq=Ernest+Ripley+killed&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjCpLHatMrKAhUGeSYKHYYKAgMQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=found%20a%20dead%20man&amp;f=false West Virginia Coal Fields: Hearings Before the Committee on Education and ....p.995 Testimony of Arnold Jackson, Superintedant of the West Virginia State Police testimony]&lt;/ref&gt; Three of Chafin's forces, two volunteers and a deputy sheriff, were killed&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2202&amp;dat=19210901&amp;id=qTZUAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=PzoNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6920,3276730&amp;hl=en Gettysburg Times September 1, 1921]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.odmp.org/officer/20304-deputy-sheriff-john-gore Odmp memorial John Gore]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=EQQ9AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA268&amp;dq=Ernest+Ripley+killed&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjCpLHatMrKAhUGeSYKHYYKAgMQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=found%20a%20dead%20man&amp;f=false West Virginia Coal Fields: Hearings Before the Committee on Education and ...".p.996 testiomony of Jackson Arnold Superintendent of the West Virginia State Police that he knew of two dead men at Blair Mountain and that a third man had been found dead in the woods at Blair Mountain]&lt;/ref&gt; and one miner was fatally wounded.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1917&amp;dat=19220619&amp;id=AE0hAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=EIIFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2213,4797821&amp;hl=en Schenectady Gazette June 19, 1922]&lt;/ref&gt;

By September 2 federal troops arrived. Realizing he would lose a lot of good miners if the battle continued with the military,{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} Bill Blizzard passed the word for the miners to start heading home the following day. Miners fearing jail and confiscation of their guns found clever ways to hide rifles and handguns in the woods before leaving Logan County. Collectors and researchers are still finding weapons and ammunition embedded in old trees and in rock crevices. Thousands of spent and live cartridges have made it into private collections.

After the battle, 985 miners were indicted for [[murder]], [[Conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy]] to commit murder, [[Accessory (legal term)|accessory]] to murder and [[treason]] against the State of West Virginia. Though some were [[Acquittal|acquitted]] by sympathetic juries, others were imprisoned for years. The last was paroled in 1925. At Blizzard's trial, the unexploded bomb was used as evidence of the government and companies' brutality, and he was acquitted.

In the short term the battle was an overwhelming victory for coal industry owners and management. UMW membership plummeted from more than 50,000 miners to approximately 10,000 over the next several years, and it was not until 1935—following the [[Great Depression]] and the beginning of the [[New Deal]] under President [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]]—that the UMW fully organized in southern West Virginia.

This union defeat had major implications for the UMWA as a whole. After [[World War I]], as the coal industry began to collapse, union mining was no longer financially sustainable. Because of the defeat in West Virginia, the union was undermined in Pennsylvania and Kentucky also. By the end of 1925 Illinois was the only remaining unionized state that could compete, in terms of soft coal production, with the others listed.

In the long term, the battle raised awareness of the appalling conditions miners faced in the dangerous West Virginia coalfields, and led directly to a change in union tactics in political battles to get the law on labor's side via confrontations with recalcitrant and abusive managements and thence to the much larger organized labor victory a few years later during the [[New Deal]] in 1933. That in turn led to the UMWA helping organize many better-known unions, such as the Steel Workers during the mid-'30s.

In the final analysis, management's success was a [[Pyrrhic victory]] that helped lead to a much larger and stronger organized labor movement in many other industries and labor union affiliations and umbrella organizations, such as the [[American Federation of Labor]] (AFL) and [[Congress of Industrial Organizations]] (CIO).

In April 2008, Blair Mountain was chosen for the list of protected places on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].  As of mid-2010, "[s]ubsidiaries of two of the United States' largest coal producers — [[Arch Coal]], Inc., and [[Massey Energy Company]],&amp;nbsp;... — hold permits to blast and [[surface mining|strip-mine]] huge chunks of the upper slopes and ridge of Blair Mountain, removing much of the mountaintop," ''[[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]]'' reported. Starting in the summer of 2006, Kenneth King, a local [[avocation|hobby]] archeologist, led a team of professional archeologists to further investigate the battlefield. King and the team's initial survey "mapped 15 combat sites and discovered more than a thousand artifacts, from rifle and shotgun shell casings to coins and batteries [and] little sign of disturbance" to the site, challenging earlier surveys conducted by Arch.&lt;ref&gt;Pringle, Heather, [http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2010/05/100520-science-environment-blair-mountain-coal-massey-energy-nation/ "Coal Firms to Strip-Mine Historic Battlefield?"], ''National Geographic'', June 2, 2010. Retrieved 2011-11-24.&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2012, a federal district judge ruled that a coalition of preservation groups did not have [[Standing (law)|standing]] to [[Lawsuit|sue]] to protect the historic site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.wvgazettemail.com/coaltattoo/?s=blair |title=Judge Rules Against Groups in Blair Mountain List Case |last1=Ward |first1=Ken |date=Oct 2, 2012 |work=Coal Tattoo |publisher=West Virginia Gazette |accessdate=Sep 15, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 26, 2014, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit]] voted 2-1 to overturn the ruling and returned the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nyden|first1=Paul J.|title=Federal appeals court says groups can sue over Blair Mountain|url=http://www.wvgazette.com/article/20140826/GZ01/140829441|website=wvgazette.com|publisher=The Charleston Gazette|accessdate=30 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2016, the order to remove the Blair Mountain battlefield from the National Register was overturned by a federal court, and the further decision to add the site back to the register was turned over to the Keeper of the National Register. On June 27, 2018, the Keeper's Office decided that the 2009 decision to remove the site from its listings was "erroneous" and issued a statement confirming that as of that date the site was again on the National Register&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4567879-Blair-MountainFinal-Decision-Memo-signed027.html |title=Decision Memorandum Regarding the 2009 Decision Removing the Blair Mountain Battlefield from the National Register of Historic Places |date=June 27, 2018 |accessdate=September 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wvgazettemail.com/news/blair-mountain-battlefield-back-on-national-register-of-historic-places/article_98d954c4-4ea6-5881-b3e7-efb42ee8c1ff.html |title=Blair Mountain Battlefield back on National Register of Historic Places |last1=Mishkin |first1=Kate |date=June 29, 2018 |publisher=Charlotte Gazette-Mail |accessdate=September 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The Blair Mountain march, as well as the events leading up to it and those immediately following it, are depicted in the novels ''[[Storming Heaven (1987 novel)|Storming Heaven]]'' ([[Denise Giardina]], 1987),  ''Blair Mountain'' (Jonathan Lynn, 2006), and ''Carla Rising'' (Topper Sherwood, 2015).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Imbrogno|first1=Douglas|title=Novel ‘Carla Rising’ animated by the Battle of Blair Mountain|url=http://www.wvgazettemail.com/article/20150719/GZ05/150719447/1178|accessdate=May 19, 2017|work=Charleston Gazette-Mail|date=July 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''The Ballad of Trenchmouth Taggart'' (Glenn Taylor, 2008) the book's main character meets Sid Hatfield, and is involved in the Matewan massacre and the ensuing battle. [[John Sayles]]' 1987 film ''[[Matewan]]'' depicts the [[Matewan Massacre]], a small part of the Blair Mountain story. [[Diane Gilliam Fisher]]'s poetry collection ''[[Kettle Bottom]]'' also focuses on the events of the Battle of Blair Mountain, from the perspective of the miners' families.

== In music ==
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2016}}
Tom Breiding's "Union Miner" from "The Unbroken Circle: Songs of the West Virginia Coalfields" (2008) accurately depicts events surrounding the Battle of Blair Mountain from the perspective of a coal miner preparing to march. "Union Miner" can be heard at virtually every event sponsored by the United Mine Workers of America today. Tom Breiding has provided the music for the UMWA's "Fairness at Patriot" campaign (2013–14), the UMWA centennial commemoration of the Ludlow Massacre in Colorado (2014), the inauguration of UMWA officers (2014), and various other Mine Workers events.

"Miners' Rebellion" (2012) by [[Alternative country|alt country]] band The Miners tells the story of the Battle of Blair Mountain.  The song is contained on The Miners debut EP also entitled ''Miners' Rebellion''.

''When Miners March'' (2007) contains 16 recently written songs (not music from the 1920s) from the audiobook ''When Miners March — The Battle of Blair Mountain''.

"Battle of Blair Mountain" (2004) is a song by [[folk singer]] [[David Rovics]] and can be found on his album ''Songs for Mahmud''.

The song "Battle of Blair Mountain" (2010) written by Louise Mosrie and Mike Richardson can be found on Louise Mosrie's album ''Home'' (Zoe Cat Music/BMI).

The song "Red Neck War" by [[Byzantine (band)|Byzantine]] is based on the Battle of Blair Mountain and can be found on the group's 2005 album ''...&amp;nbsp;And They Shall Take Up Serpents'' (Prosthetic Records). The song "Black Lung" by The Radio Nationals (band) is also based on this conflict.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

''Blair Pathways'' (2011) is a multimedia project, including a CD and maps, tracing the history of the Blair Mountain area and its labor disputes.  It contains music by a number of traditional artists, including [[Riley Baugus]] and [[Tim Eriksen]].

Chicago Irish folk punk band [[The Fisticuffs]] released a song titled "The Ballad of Bill Blizzard" on their 2011 final album "You'll Not Take Us Alive" about the battle of Blair Mountain.

== Historic interpretation ==
The Battle of Blair Mountain is interpreted by the State of [[West Virginia]] through a Historic Highway marker.  The marker was made by the West Virginia Division of Culture and History.  The marker reads, "BATTLE OF BLAIR MT.  In August of 1921, 7000 striking miners led by Bill Blizzard met at Marmet for a march on Logan to organize the southern coalfields for the UMWA.  Reaching Blair Mt. on August 31, they were repelled by deputies and mine guards, under Sheriff Don Chafin, waiting in fortified positions.  The five day battle ended with the arrival of U.S. Army and Air Corps.  UMWA organizing efforts in southern WV were halted until 1933."  The marker is on West Virginia 17, about eight miles (13&amp;nbsp;km) east of Logan, between Ethel and Blair.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Marking Our Past: West Virginia's Historical Highway Markers|last=State of West Virginia|publisher=West Virginia Division of Culture and History|year=2002|location=Charleston|pages=83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[network science]], a '''biased random walk on a graph''' is a time path process in which an evolving variable jumps from its current state to one of various potential new states; unlike in a pure [[random walk]], the probabilities of the potential new states are unequal.

Biased random walks on a graph provide an approach for the [https://www.springer.com/birkhauser/mathematics/book/978-0-8176-4788-9 structural analysis] of [[Graph (discrete mathematics)#Undirected graph|undirected graphs]] in order to extract their symmetries when the network is too complex or when it is not large enough to be analyzed by [[Statistics|statistical methods]]. The concept of biased random walks on a graph has attracted the attention of many researchers and data companies over the past decade especially in the transportation and [[social network]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Roberta Sinatra, Jesús Gómez-Gardeñes, Renaud Lambiotte, Vincenzo Nicosia, and Vito Latora|title=Maximal-entropy random walks in complex networks with limited information|journal=Physical Review E|date=March 2011|doi= 10.1103/PhysRevE.83.030103 |pmid=21517435|volume=83|issue=3|pages=030103|arxiv=1007.4936|bibcode=2011PhRvE..83c0103S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Latora|title=Entropy rate of diffusion processes on complex networks|journal=Physical Review E|date=Dec 2008 |doi= 10.1103/PhysRevE.78.065102 |pmid=19256892|volume=78|issue=6|pages=065102| arxiv=0712.0278| bibcode=2008PhRvE..78f5102G}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On an [[Graph (discrete mathematics)#Undirected graph|undirected graph]], a walker takes a step from the current node, &lt;math&gt;j,&lt;/math&gt; to node &lt;math&gt;i.&lt;/math&gt; Assuming that each node has an attribute &lt;math&gt;\alpha_i,&lt;/math&gt; the probability of jumping from node &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;T_{ij}^\alpha=\frac{\alpha_i A_{ij}}{\sum_{k} \alpha_k A_{kj}},&lt;/math&gt; 

where &lt;math&gt;A_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; represents the topological weight of the edge going from &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;i.&lt;/math&gt;

In fact, the steps of the walker are biased by the factor of &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; which may differ from one node to another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| authors=R. Lambiotte, R. Sinatra, J.-C. Delvenne, T.S. Evans, M. Barahona, V. Latora|title=Flow graphs: interweaving dynamics and structure| journal = Physical Review E|date=Dec 2010|doi=10.1103/PhysRevE.84.017102|pmid=21867345|volume=84|issue=1|pages=017102|arxiv=1012.1211|bibcode=2011PhRvE..84a7102L}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Depending on the network, the attribute &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; can be interpreted differently. It might be implied as the attraction of a person in a [[social network]], it might be [[betweenness centrality]] or even it might be explained as an intrinsic characteristic of a node. In case of a [http://www.math.uah.edu/stat/markov/WalkGraph.html fair random walk on graph] &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is one for all the nodes.

In case of shortest paths random walks&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors=Blanchard, Volchenkov, D|title=Mathematical Analysis of Urban Spatial Networks| date=2008|doi=10.1007/978-3-540-87829-2| url= https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233971652| journal=Understanding Complex Systems|isbn=978-3-540-87828-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;math&gt;\alpha_i&lt;/math&gt; is the total number of the shortest paths between all pairs of nodes that pass through the node &lt;math&gt;i &lt;/math&gt;. In fact the walker prefers the nodes with higher [[betweenness centrality]] which is defined as below:

:&lt;math&gt;C(i)=\tfrac{\text{Total number of shortest paths through } i}{\text{Total number of shortest paths}}&lt;/math&gt;

Based on the above equation, the recurrence time to a node in the biased walk is given by:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Volchenkov D |author2=Blanchard P|title=Fair and biased random walks on undirected graphs and related entropies|date=2011|publisher=Birkhäuser|page=380|url=http://pub.uni-bielefeld.de/publication/1997352|isbn=9780817649036}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Borneo Orangutan Survival''' ('''BOS''') '''Foundation'''  is an [[Indonesia]]n non-profit [[NGO]] founded by Dr [[Willie Smits]] in 1991 and dedicated to the conservation of the [[Endangered species|endangered]] [[Bornean orangutan]] and its habitat through the involvement of local people. It is audited by a multinational auditor company&lt;ref&gt;See http://www.sambojalodge.com/AboutBOSFoundation/ – "every year we are audited by Price Waterhouse Coopers (or similar well reputed firm)"&lt;/ref&gt; and operates under the formal agreement with the Indonesian Ministry of Forest to conserve and rehabilitate [[orangutan]]s. BOS manages orangutan rescue, rehabilitation and re-introduction programmes in East and Central Kalimantan. With 804 orangutans (per November 2012) in its care and employing between six hundred and a thousand people at a hundred sites&lt;ref&gt;Thompson 2010,  p180&lt;/ref&gt; BOS is the biggest primate conservation NGO worldwide.

Nyaru Menteng and Samboja Lestari are the BOS sites that have received most extensive media coverage. Nyaru Menteng, founded and run by [[Lone Drøscher Nielsen]], has been the subject of a number of TV series, including ''[[Orangutan Diary]]'' and ''[[Orangutan Island]]''. Samboja Lestari featured recently in a 2009 [[TED (conference)|TED]] talk, ''"Willie Smits restores a rainforest"''&lt;ref name="TED"/&gt; in which Smits describes how he recreated forest to provide habitat for rescued orangutans.

==History==
In 1989 Dr. Willie Smits, then a forest ecologist, had his first encounter with an orangutan, a sick baby female in a cage, while walking in the market in [[Balikpapan]], [[East Kalimantan]]. He was struck by "the saddest eyes" he had ever seen and going back later found her on a rubbish heap and took her home. He nursed her back to health and a few weeks later was given another to care for, this time a sick baby male. The number of orangutans in his care grew, and from these beginnings what was initially the "Balikpapan Orangutan Society" came into being in 1991, with the support of fellow researchers at the Tropenbos Kalimantan Program and the schoolchildren of Balikpapan. As its sphere of activity broadened, it was renamed the Borneo Orangutan Survival Foundation in 1994. Since then it has received increasing recognition in Indonesia and globally, with sister organizations in 11 other countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sn/tvradio/programmes/orangutandiary/about.shtml |title=TV &amp; Radio Follow-up – Orangutan Diary (Series 2) |publisher=BBC |date=2009-01-12 |accessdate=2011-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/picturegalleries/earth/3131064/Orangutan-diary-to-highlight-World-Animal-Day.html |title=Filming BBC's Orangutan Diary (Series 2) |publisher=Telegraph |date= 2008-10-03|accessdate=2011-04-02 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-1076592/My-orangutans-sensed-I-8217-d-cancer--gentle-I-weak.html | location=London | work=Daily Mail | first=Amanda | last=Riley-Jones | title=My orangutans sensed I'd had cancer - they were so gentle with me when I was weak | date=2008-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; according to the [[IUCN Red List]] of [[mammal]]s, and is listed on Appendix I of [[CITES]].
The total number of Bornean orangutans is estimated to be less than 14&amp;nbsp;percent of what it was in the recent past (from around 10,000&amp;nbsp;years ago until the middle of the twentieth century) and this sharp decline has occurred mostly over the past few decades due to human activities and development.&lt;ref name="IUCN Pongo pygmaeus"/&gt; Their habitat is so much reduced that they are now only to be found in pockets of remaining rainforest.&lt;ref name="IUCN Pongo pygmaeus"/&gt; The largest remaining population is found in the forest around the [[Sabangau River]], but this environment too is at risk.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wildcru.org/aboutus/people/cheyne_pdfs/Cheyne%20Gibbon%20Density%202007.pdf Density and population estimate of gibbons (Hylobates albibarbis) in the Sabangau catchment, Central Kalimantan, Indonesia] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326001206/http://www.wildcru.org/aboutus/people/cheyne_pdfs/Cheyne%20Gibbon%20Density%202007.pdf |date=March 26, 2009 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the IUCN, it is expected that in 10 to 30 years orangutans will be [[extinct]] if there is no serious effort to overcome the threats that they are facing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2003/09/0930_030930_orangutanthreat.html |title=NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC: Wild Orangutans: Extinct by 2023? |publisher=News.nationalgeographic.com |date=2010-10-28 |accessdate=2011-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=NINIEK KARMINI, Associated Press Writer |url=http://www.foxnews.com/wires/2006Nov15/0,4670,OrangutansBesieged,00.html |title=Orangutans in Losing Battle in Indonesia |publisher=Fox News |date=2006-11-15 |accessdate=2011-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This view is also supported by the [[United Nations Environment Programme]], which states in its report that due to [[Deforestation in Borneo|deforestation]] by [[illegal logging]], fire and the extensive development of [[oil palm]] plantations (see [[Social and environmental impact of palm oil]]), orangutans are endangered, and if the current trend continues, they will become extinct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unep.org/grasp/docs/2007Jan-LastStand-of-Orangutan-report.pdf |title=United Nations Environment Programme: The Last Stand of the Orangutan – State of Emergency: Illegal Logging, Fire and Palm Oil in Indonesia's National Parks |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2011-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Orangutan rescue and rehabilitation centres==

===Wanariset===
Wanariset began as a tropical forest research station near [[Balikpapan]] in the Indonesian Province of [[East Kalimantan]] and was developed as an orangutan rescue and rehabilitation centre.

===Nyaru Menteng===
[[File:Kepin - Kevin taking a nap.jpg|right|thumb|Kevin, one of the young orangutans at Nyaru Menteng, takes a nap.]]
[[Nyaru Menteng]] {{coord|2|6|34|S|113|49|14|E|display=inline}} is an orangutan rescue and rehabilitation centre 28&amp;nbsp;km from [[Palangkaraya]] in [[Central Kalimantan]]. Lone Drøscher Nielsen sought the advice of Dr Smits about the possibility of creating a new project in Central Kalimantan to deal with the swelling numbers of orphaned orangutans.  Dr Smits agreed to help and, with the financial backing of the Gibbon Foundation and BOS Indonesia, Drøscher Nielsen founded Nyaru Menteng in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.forests4orangutans.org/who-we-are/|title= The Organisation|publisher= [[Orangutan Land Trust]]|accessdate=31 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was able to build the facility under an agreement with the Indonesian Ministry of Forestry, and Nyaru Menteng officially opened its doors to the first dozen orangutans in 1999.

The sanctuary was designed to hold up to 100 orphaned orangutans while they go through rehabilitation. In addition to quarantine cages, medical clinic, and nursery, the sanctuary had a large area of forest in which orangutans could learn the skills needed to live in the wild.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.savetheorangutan.co.uk/?page_id=17|title= Save the Orangutan |author= The Nyaru Menteng Sanctuary|accessdate=31 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nyaru Menteng quickly became the largest primate rescue project in the world, with nearly 700 orphaned and displaced orangutans in its care at the present.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video

Many of these orangutans are only weeks old when they arrive, and all of them are psychologically traumatized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://blog.ted.com/2009/03/orangutans_and.php|title= Orangutans and palm oil: What's the connection?|author= Richard Zimmerman|date= 5 March 2009|publisher= TED Blog|accessdate=31 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sanctuary not only saves the mostly orphaned baby orangutans from the local farmers and illegal pet-traders, but has developed a process for their gradual re-introduction to the remaining Borneo [[rainforest]].

As of 2009, up to 20 young orangutans arrive every month. The centre's running costs are $1.5m a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bowditch |first=Gillian |title=TV shows Stranrear doctor curing orangutans|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/scotland/article5779796.ece|accessdate=7 June 2010|newspaper=The Sunday Times|date=22 February 2009|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are 170 staff: babysitters, assistants, people working in the medical department, guards and other workers.&lt;ref name="redapes1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://redapes.org/bos-projects/nyaru-menteng |title=Nyaru Menteng |publisher=redapes.org |date= |accessdate=2011-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Associated with the centre are:&lt;ref name="redapes1"/&gt;
*"The Workers' Village" which accommodates workers from outside the locality;
*The Islands: Kaja, Palas I. and II., Hampapak Matei and Bangamat, all islands in the Rongan River with primitive feeding-platforms and jetties;
*The Information Centre, where local schools visit, and from where information campaigns about alternatives to the cutting are sent out all over Borneo.
*The Fruit plantation, "Nyaru Menteng Lestari", 3 ha planted with fruit-bearing trees, such as mango, pineapple and rambutan.

With helicopters, mapping and other logistical support from the world's largest mining company [[BHP Billiton]] that operates a coal mining concession in Central Kalimantan, Nyaru Menteng released 36 adult orangutans in 2007, and 25 in 2008, filmed for ''[[Orangutan Diary]]''. A planned airlift of 48 orangutans scheduled to take place in July 2009 was cancelled as BHP Billiton intended to withdraw from the area for strategic reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hickman|first=Martin |title= Hope of freedom for orang-utans dashed|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/nature/hope-of-freedom-for-orangutans-dashed-1762058.html|accessdate=7 June 2010|newspaper=The Independent|date=27 July 2009|location=London}} BHP Billiton did not in fact withdraw, and in January 2010, agreed to sell a 25% stake in the concession instead.{{cite news|title=BHP Billiton to sell stake in Maruwai to Adaro|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2010/04/01/bhp-billiton-sell-stake-maruwai-adaro.html|accessdate=8 June 2010|newspaper=The Jakarta Post|date=4 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Samboja Lestari]] {{coord|1|2|44|S|116|59|15|E|display=inline}} is a reforestation project on nearly {{convert|2000 |ha |sqmi}} of deforested, degraded and burnt land in East Kalimantan. In 2001, BOS started purchasing land near Wanariset. The area it acquired had been [[Deforestation|deforested]] by mechanical logging, drought and severe fires and was covered in alang-alang grass ([[Imperata cylindrica]]). The aim was to restore the [[rainforest]] and provide a safe haven for rehabilitated orangutans while at the same time providing a source of income for local people. The name Samboja Lestari roughly translates as the "everlasting conservation of Samboja".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orangutans.com.au/Orangutans-Survival-Information/Samboja-Lestari-128959069771931264.aspx |title=BOS Australia website |publisher=Orangutans.com.au |date= |accessdate=2011-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Reforestation]] and rehabilitation is the core of the  project, with hundreds of indigenous species planted. By the middle of 2006 over 740 different tree species had been planted;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sambojalodge.com/AboutBOSFoundation/BOSSambojaLestari/ |title=Samboja Lodge website |publisher=Sambojalodge.com |date= |accessdate=2011-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; by 2009 there were 1200 species of trees, 137 species of birds and nine species of primates.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson 2010, p193&lt;/ref&gt;

The Orangutan Reintroduction Project at Wanariset was moved to Samboja Lestari. "Forest Schools" were established, areas that provide natural, educational playgrounds for the orangutans in which to learn forest skills. Here the orangutans roam freely but under supervision and are returned to sleeping cages for the night. "Orangutan islands" were created where the orangutans and other wildlife that cannot return to the wild are nevertheless able to live in almost completely natural conditions.

Alongside the orangutan reintroduction work, BOS has promoted forms of farming that do not involve burning and destroying forests, by switching to agriculture combining rattan, sugar palms and fruits and vegetables. A community has developed that can now support itself on the land. Smits believes that to develop the orangutan population, their forest habitat must first be built; also, to achieve sustainable solutions the root social problems must be addressed by empowering local communities to take up livelihood options that is more rewarding than logging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://masarang.or.id/ |title=Welcome to the Frontpage |publisher=Masarang.or.id |date=2009-07-31 |accessdate=2011-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Yellow vented Bulbul2.jpg|right|thumb|[[Yellow-vented Bulbul|Yellow-vented bulbul]], one of the 137 species of birds now found at Samboja Lestari]]
In his 2009 TED talk Smits claimed there had been a substantial increase in cloud cover and 30% more rainfall due to the reforestation at Samboja Lestari.&lt;ref name="TED"&gt;February 2009 [[TED (conference)|TED talk]], {{cite web |url= http://www.ted.com/talks/lang/eng/willie_smits_restores_a_rainforest.html|title= Willie Smits restores a rainforest |accessdate=28 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To finance the nature reserve, BOS created a system of "land-purchasing", a "Create Rainforest" initiative where donors can symbolically adopt square metres of rainforest&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.createrainforest.com/en/idea |title=Create Rainforest website |publisher=Createrainforest.com |date= |accessdate=2011-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are able to view and follow the progress of their "purchase"  in the project area with [[Google Earth]] satellite images from 2002 and 2007 with additional information overlaid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JhcRKlGuCA |title='&amp;#39;"Google Earth Hero: BOS, Borneo rain forest"'&amp;#39; on YouTube |publisher=Youtube.com |date= |accessdate=2011-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Samboja Lodge&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.sambojalodge.com/AboutBOSFoundation/|title= About BOS|accessdate=27 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; was established to provide accommodation for visitors and volunteers at Samboja. Its design was based upon local architecture and its interior and exterior walls are made of recycled materials.

The SarVision&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sarvision.nl/index.php?page=about |title=Sarvision website |publisher=Sarvision.nl |date= |accessdate=2011-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Satellite Natural Resources Monitoring Centre was established to monitor deforestation and illegal logging and the relentless growth of palm oil in unsuitable locations. A study commissioned by [[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF]] Netherlands with SarVision showed that almost half of present oil palm plantations are not located on suitable land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.greenkampong.com/green_reporter/environmental-hero-willie-smits/ |title=Environmental Hero – Willie Smits : Green Kampong – Inspiring a greener today |publisher=Greenkampong.com |date=2009-10-16 |accessdate=2011-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of satellite technology and [[GIS]] has enabled Sarvison to monitor forests down to the individual tree level, to develop accountability in the management of the forest and identify where palm oil plantations are destroying areas of forest illegally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esri.com/news/arcnews/winter0910articles/willie-smits.html |title=Willie Smits Shares Methodology for Sustainable Forests - ArcNews Winter 2009/2010 Issue |publisher=Esri.com |date= |accessdate=2011-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mawas===
{{coord|1|59|S|114|39|E|display=inline}} Mawas is a forest conservation, reforestation and research area in [[Central Kalimantan]]. The Mawas project is now in its development phase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.orangutans.com.au/Orangutans-Survival-Information/Mawas.aspx|title= Mawas|author= Borneo Orangutan Survival (BOS) Australia|date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=5 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main aim of the project is to protect the fast-disappearing [[Borneo peat swamp forests|peat lands]] through collaboration with the Central and Local Governments and the local communities. The Mawas area is home to one of the last tracts of forest supporting wild orangutans. An estimated 3,000 wild orangutans are found in this area. Mawas is also important for its biodiversity and the geological conditions of Mawas make it a storage house of giga-tonnes of [[Carbon sequestration|sequestered]] carbon.  Over a period of 8,000 years, decaying plant matter from the swamp forests has built up 13 – 15&amp;nbsp;metre high domes of peat.

In September 2003, the provincial parliament in Central Kalimantan approved a new land use plan that designates {{convert|500000|ha |sqmi}} in the Mawas area to be managed by BOS for conservation. BOS is currently working in an area of about {{convert|280000|ha |sqmi}} within the ex-[[Mega Rice Project (Kalimantan)|Mega Rice Project]] area.

BOS has initiated a forest conservation project with the objectives of:

* conserving peat swamp forest area including reforesting degraded areas;
* preserving the bio-diversity of the area;
* providing global greenhouse gas (GHG) benefits;
* providing access to programs such as health and education; and
* improving incomes and building capacity and economic prosperity in local communities
* assisting communities in learning technical skills including aquaculture, rice cultivation, agro-forestry and farm development
* assisting local independence and self-sustaining livelihoods.
* providing education to children on the environment and conservation, by visiting schools 
* providing community awareness programs as well as co-operative conservation programs.

The area is important for research activities, with BOS operating the Tuanan Research Station in Kapaus. The Station has been established through extensive consultation with all local people and institutions and the use of local labour. Its purpose is to provide a year-round base for scientists tracking and observing the wild orangutan population. BOS is involved in patrolling and monitoring the area for illegal activities via air and land and supporting law enforcement by providing guidance and [[legal awareness]] programs to the community and government.

===Kutai===
On 15 July 2010 at an international meeting on orangutan conservation in [[Bali]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bali to host orangutan conservation workshop |url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2010/05/26/bali-host-orangutan-conservation-workshop.html|newspaper=The Jakarta Post|date=26 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Indonesian forestry ministry secretary general Boen Purnama announced that the Indonesian government will grant a permit to BOS to reserve thousands of hectares of forest formerly used for logging for the release of around 200 orangutans in the [[Kutai]] area in East Kalimantan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Indonesia pledges forests for orangutan conservation|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5iXKwt_Tg8Z50qdRqSqyHgDCCeFjQ|newspaper=AFP|date=16 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The forest will need to be restored before it can be used for conservation. In response, BOS set up a company, PT Orangutan Habitat Restoration Indonesia (ROI), to restore 86,450 hectares of former timber concession area in the East Kutai district, to be the new home for rehabilitated orangutans. BOS chairman Togu Manurung announced the start of gradual release as April 2011 at the latest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Orangutans in rehabilitation to get new homes in Kalimantan|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2010/08/24/orangutans-rehabilitation-get-new-homes-kalimantan.html|accessdate=4 September 2010|newspaper=The Jakarta Post|date=24 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other projects==
BOS also runs the Primate Conservation Education Program in the privately funded Primate Centre at the [[Ragunan Zoo]] in [[Jakarta]]. The centre was designed by Willie Smits so that orangutans would be able to live in as natural surroundings as possible. Visitors view the orangutans through thick darkened glass so that the orangutans are not disturbed by their presence.

== Documentaries ==
The work of the Borneo Orangutan Survival Foundation has appeared in a number of [[documentary|documentaries]]. The orangutans of Nyaru Menteng were the followed in the two series of ''[[Orangutan Diary]]'' produced by the [[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sn/tvradio/programmes/orangutandiary/about.shtml |title=BBC programme information on Orangutan Diary |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2009-01-12 |accessdate=2011-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also, as they were reintroduced to a semi-wild habitat, in the 23 programmes of the ''[[Orangutan Island]]'' series, produced by [[NHNZ]]. ''[[The Disenchanted Forest]]'' was an award-winning 1999 film that follows orphan orangutans as they are rehabilitated and returned to their rainforest home. It centres on three BOS projects – Wanariset, Nyaru Menteng and Mawas. ''[[The Burning Season (2008 film)|The Burning Season]]'' is a 2008 documentary about the burning of rainforests in [[Indonesia]] which featured Lone Drøscher Nielsen. Willie Smits appeared in ''Dying for a Biscuit'', a 2010 [[BBC]] [[Panorama (British television series)|Panorama]] investigation which looked into the causes of deforestation, focusing particularly on illegal logging and the palm oil industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00r4t3s |title=One Programmes - Panorama, Dying for a Biscuit |publisher=BBC |date= |accessdate=2011-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, Australian Current Affairs Program [[60 Minutes (Australian TV program)]] featured a special ''Jungle Orphans'' showing the work of BOS and Borneo Orangutan Survival Australia President Tony Gilding and Vice President [[Louise Grossfeldt]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sixtyminutes.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=8652208 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-11-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304001605/http://sixtyminutes.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=8652208 |archivedate=2016-03-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Capital punishment]] in [[Vatican City]]''' was legal between 1929 and 1969, reserved for attempted [[assassination]] of the [[Pope]], but has never been applied there.&lt;ref name=megivern&gt;{{cite book| title=The Death Penalty| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lG-a_RBO8VgC&amp;pg=PA261&amp;lpg=PA261&amp;dq=capital+punishment+for+pope+1969&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=aEIUVxnqB-&amp;sig=--c7xCdJmhog-Cm6NNZgqQ9Nox0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=0iPtUOxV55bRAcytgYgO&amp;ved=0CFgQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=capital%20punishment%20for%20pope%201969&amp;f=false| last=Megivern| first=James J.| publisher=Paulist Press| location=Mawah, New Jersey| date=August 1997| pages=261–262| isbn=978-0-8091-0487-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[List of people executed in the Papal States|Executions]] were carried out elsewhere in the [[Papal States]] during their existence.

==Background==
{{main article|Catholic Church and capital punishment}}
[[File:Mastro Titta.jpg|thumb|right|[[Giovanni Battista Bugatti]], executioner of the Papal States between 1796 and 1865, carried out 516 executions ''(Bugatti pictured offering [[snuff (tobacco)|snuff]] to a condemned prisoner in front of [[Castel Sant'Angelo]])''.]]
The death penalty had support from early Catholic theologians, though some of them such as [[Saint Ambrose]] encouraged members of the clergy not to pronounce or carry out capital punishment. [[Augustine of Hippo|Saint Augustine]] answered objections to capital punishment rooted in the [[Ten Commandments|first commandment]] in ''[[City of God (book)|The City of God]]''.&lt;ref name="dulles"&gt;{{cite news| authorlink=Avery Dulles| last=Dulles| first=Avery| date=April 2001| title=Catholicism and Capital Punishment| url=http://www.firstthings.com/article/2001/04/catholicism-amp-capital-punishment| work=First Things: A Monthly Journal of Religion and Public Life | pages=30–35|  volume=121| publisher=catholiceducation.org| accessdate=2016-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Augustine's argument is as such: "Since the agent of authority is but a sword in the hand [of God], it is in no way contrary to the commandment 'Thou shalt not kill' for the representative of the state's authority to put criminals to death".&lt;ref name="allen"&gt;{{cite news| last=Allen| first=John L., Jr.| date=14 September 2001| url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/He+executed+justice.-a078728719| title=He executed justice—papal execution Giovanni Battista Bugatti's life and work| work=National Catholic Reporter| publisher=freelibrary.com| accessdate=2014-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Aquinas]] and [[Duns Scotus]] argued that civil authority to carry out capital punishment was supported by scripture.&lt;ref name="dulles"/&gt;

[[Pope Innocent III]] required [[Peter Waldo]] and the [[Waldensians]] to accept that "secular power can, without mortal sin, exercise judgement of blood, provided that it punishes with justice, not out of hatred, with prudence, not precipitation" as a prerequisite for reconciliation with the church.&lt;ref name="dulles"/&gt; During the Middle Ages and into the modern period, the [[Inquisition]] was authorized by the [[Holy See]] to turn over heretics to secular authority for execution, and the [[Papal States]] carried out executions for a variety of offences.&lt;ref name="dulles"/&gt;

The [[Roman Catechism]] (1566) codified the teaching that God had entrusted civil authorities with the power over life and death.&lt;ref name="dulles"/&gt; [[Doctor of the Church|Doctors of the Church]] [[Robert Bellarmine]] and [[Alphonsus Liguori]], as well as modern theologians such as [[Francisco de Vitoria]], [[Thomas More]], and [[Francisco Suárez]] continued this tradition; [[Pope Pius XII]] issued an [[allocution]] to medical experts to that effect.&lt;ref name="dulles"/&gt;

==History of the Statute==
The [[Lateran Treaty]] of 1929 copied from the contemporaneous Italian legal code (concerning attempted assassinations of the [[King of Italy]]), providing for capital punishment for anyone who attempted to assassinate the pope within Vatican City.&lt;ref name=megivern/&gt;  Article 8 of the Lateran Treaty provides:

{{cquote|Considering the person of the Supreme Pontiff to be sacred and inviolable, Italy declares any attempt against His person or any incitement to commit such attempt to be punishable by the same penalties as all similar attempts and incitements to commit the same against the person of the King.&lt;br&gt;All offences or public insults committed within Italian territory against the person of the Supreme Pontiff, whether by means of speeches, acts, or writings, shall be punished in the same manner as offences and insults against the person of the King.&lt;ref name=lateran&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/secretariat_state/archivio/documents/rc_seg-st_19290211_patti-lateranensi_it.html| title=Lateran Pact: Agreement between the Holy See and Italy| date=11 February 1929| language=Italian| publisher=[[Secretariat of State (Holy See)|Secretariat of State]]| accessdate=2014-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

There were no attempted assassinations of the pope within Vatican City while the statute was on the books.&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;{{cite news| work=[[The New York Times]]| date=16 January 1971| url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FA0C16FF3A55127B93C4A8178AD85F458785F9&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=Vatican+Says+It+Revoked+Its+Death+Penalty+in+%2769&amp;st=p| title=Vatican Says It Revoked Its Death Penalty in '69| page=33| publisher=NYTimes.com| accessdate=2014-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was no longer in force in 1981, when [[Mehmet Ali Ağca]] [[Pope John Paul II assassination attempt|attempted to assassinate Pope John Paul II]], and in any case Ağca was tried by an Italian court rather than in the Vatican.

==Abolition==
[[Pope Paul VI]] removed the capital punishment statute from the "fundamental law" of Vatican City in 1969, along with other adaptations, four years after closing the [[Second Vatican Council]], announcing the change only in the August 1969 issue of the ''[[Gazette (Vatican City)|Gazette]]'', which is published in [[Latin]].&lt;ref name=megivern/&gt; The change came to public attention only in January 1971 after reporters accused Paul VI of hypocrisy for his criticisms of planned executions in [[Spain]] and the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref name=megivern/&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt;

'''Gale Sondergaard''' (born '''Edith Holm Sondergaard'''; February 15, 1899 &amp;ndash; August 14, 1985) was an American actress.

Sondergaard began her acting career in theater, and progressed to films in 1936. She was the first recipient of the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress]] for her film debut in ''[[Anthony Adverse]]'' (1936). She regularly played supporting roles in  films during the late 1930s and 1940s, including ''[[The Cat and the Canary (1939 film)|The Cat and the Canary]]'' (1939), ''[[The Mark of Zorro (1940 film)|The Mark of Zorro]]'' (1940) and ''[[The Letter (1940 film)|The Letter]]'' (1940). For her role in ''[[Anna and the King of Siam (film)|Anna and the King of Siam]]'' (1946), she was nominated for her second Best Supporting Actress Academy Award. After the late 1940s, her screen work came to an abrupt end for the next 20 years.

Married to the director [[Herbert Biberman]], Sondergaard supported him when he was accused of communism and named as one of the [[Hollywood Ten]] in the early 1950s. She moved with Biberman to New York City and worked in theatre, and acted in film and television occasionally from the late 1960s. She moved back to Los Angeles where she died from cerebrovascular [[thrombosis]].

==Early life==
She was born Edith Holm Sondergaard on February 15, 1899 in [[Litchfield, Minnesota]] to [[Danes|Danish]]-American parents, Hans and Christin (Holm) Sondergaard. Her father taught at [[University of Minnesota]], where she was a drama student.&lt;ref name="Nissen2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Axel Nissen|title=Actresses of a Certain Character: Forty Familiar Hollywood Faces from the Thirties to the Fifties|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IbpwDl1nt0MC&amp;pg=PA196|year=2007|publisher=McFarland &amp; Company, Inc|isbn=978-0-7864-2746-8|pages=196–202}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stage and film career==
===Until the late-1940s===
She studied acting at the Minneapolis School of Dramatic Arts before joining the John Keller Shakespeare Company. She later toured North America in productions of ''[[Hamlet]]'', ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]'', ''[[The Merchant of Venice]],'' and ''[[Macbeth]]''. After becoming a member of the [[Theatre Guild]], she began performing on the New York stage.&lt;ref name=IBDB&gt;{{cite web|title=Gale Sondergaard|url=http://www.ibdb.com/person.php?id=60564|website=International Broadway Database|publisher=The Broadway League|accessdate=2 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gale Sondergaard in The Letter trailer.jpg|left|200px|thumb|in the trailer for ''[[The Letter (1940 film)|The Letter]]'' (1940)]]
Sondergaard made her first film appearance in ''[[Anthony Adverse]]'' (1936) as Faith Paleologue and became the first recipient of the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress]] for her performance.&lt;ref name="Nissen2007"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The 9th Academy Awards|url=http://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1937|website=Oscars.org|publisher=Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences|accessdate=3 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her career as an actress flourished during the 1930s, including a role with [[Paul Muni]] in ''[[The Life of Emile Zola]]'' (1937).&lt;ref name="AFICatalog"/&gt;

During pre-production of [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]'s classic ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'' (1939), an early idea was to have the [[Wicked Witch of the West]] portrayed as a slinky, glamorous villainess in a black, sequined costume, inspired by the Evil Queen in [[Walt Disney]]'s ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'' (1937).&lt;ref name="Nissen2007"/&gt; Sondergaard originally was cast as the witch and was photographed for two wardrobe tests, both of which survive. One was as a glamorous wicked witch, and another as a conventionally ugly wicked witch. After the decision was made to have an ugly wicked witch, Sondergaard, reluctant to wear the disfiguring makeup and fearing it could damage her career, withdrew from the role, and it went to veteran character actress [[Margaret Hamilton (actress)|Margaret Hamilton]]. Sondergaard was, however, cast as the sultry and slinky Tylette (a magically humanized but devious cat) in ''[[The Blue Bird (1940 film)|The Blue Bird]]'' (1940).&lt;ref name="Lev2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Lev|title=Twentieth Century-Fox: The Zanuck-Skouras Years, 1935–1965|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dA3LcAd5O5gC&amp;pg=PA68|date=15 March 2013|publisher=University of Texas Press|isbn=978-0-292-74447-9|pages=67–68}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around the same time, she played the role of the exotic, sinister wife in ''[[The Letter (1940 film)|The Letter]]'' (also 1940), a film starring [[Bette Davis]].&lt;ref name="Nissen2007"/&gt; She featured in a supporting role in ''[[The Spider Woman]]'' (aka ''Sherlock Holmes and the Spider Woman'', 1943),&lt;ref name="Folkart"&gt;{{cite news|last=Folkart|first=Burt A.|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1985-08-15/news/mn-1616_1_gale-sondergaard|title=Gale Sondergaard Dies; Movies' 'Spider Woman'|work=Los Angeles Times|date=August 15, 1985|accessdate=24 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; part of the [[Sherlock Holmes (1939 film series)|Universal cycle]], followed by the non-canonical ''[[The Spider Woman Strikes Back]]'' (1946), also for [[Universal Pictures|Universal]].

She received a second Academy Award nomination as Best Supporting Actress for her role as the king's principal wife in ''[[Anna and the King of Siam (film)|Anna and the King of Siam]]'' (1946).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1946 19th Oscar nominees|url=http://awardsdatabase.oscars.org/ampas_awards/DisplayMain.jsp?curTime=1407030431677|website=Oscar.org|publisher=Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences|accessdate=3 August 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808061910/http://awardsdatabase.oscars.org/ampas_awards/DisplayMain.jsp?curTime=1407030431677|archivedate=8 August 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===House Un-American Activities Committee===
Sondergaard's career suffered irreparable damage during the United States Congressional [[House Un-American Activities Committee|HUAC]] [[Second Red Scare|Red Scare]] of the early 1950s when her husband was accused of being a [[communism|communist]] and named as one of the [[Hollywood Ten]].&lt;ref name="Hogan2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=David J. Hogan|title=The Wizard of Oz FAQ: All That's Left to Know About Life, According to Oz|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PuYMBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT113|date=1 June 2014|publisher=Applause Theatre &amp; Cinema Books|isbn=978-1-4803-9719-4|pages=113–115}}&lt;/ref&gt; (In the 2000 movie ''One of the Hollywood Ten'', Sondergaard was portrayed by actress [[Greta Scacchi]] while [[Jeff Goldblum]] was cast as Biberman.) With her career stalled, she supported her husband during the production of ''[[Salt of the Earth (1954 film)|Salt of the Earth]]'' (1954).&lt;ref name="Eagan2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Daniel Eagan|title=America's Film Legacy: The Authoritative Guide to the Landmark Movies in the National Film Registry|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FcioAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA483|date=26 November 2009|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=978-1-4411-1647-5|page=483}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Baker2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ellen R. Baker|title=On Strike and on Film: Mexican American Families and Blacklisted Filmmakers in Cold War America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HciBOUI19RYC&amp;pg=PT106|date=12 March 2007|publisher=UNC Press Books|isbn=978-1-4696-0654-5|page=106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[One of the Hollywood Ten]]'' (2000) chronicled Sondergaard's relationship with Biberman and her role in the making of ''Salt of the Earth''. The Bibermans sold their home in Hollywood shortly after they completed ''Salt of the Earth'', and moved to New York where Sondergaard was able to work in theatre.&lt;ref name="Hogan2014"/&gt;

===Later career===
In 1969, she appeared in an off-Broadway one-woman show entitled ''Woman''. Sondergaard resumed her career in film and television around the same time.&lt;ref name="Folkart"/&gt; Her revived career extended into the early 1980s.&lt;!-- "Echoes" (1983, see below) was actually shot in the period November 1979 to January 1980 according to the AFI database. --&gt;

==Personal life==
Her younger sister Hester Sondergaard was also an actress who featured in ''[[The Naked City]]'' (1948) and ''[[Jigsaw (1949 film)|Jigsaw]]'' (1949).&lt;ref name="Hester"&gt;{{cite web|title=Hester Sodergaard|url=http://www.afi.com/members/catalog/SearchResult.aspx?s=&amp;retailCheck=&amp;Type=PN&amp;CatID=DATABIN_CAST&amp;ID=70517&amp;AN_ID=&amp;searchedFor=Hester_Sondergaard|website=AFI Catalog of Feature Films|publisher=American Film Institute|accessdate=August 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sondergaard first married in 1922 to actor Neill O'Malley; they divorced in 1930. On May 15, 1930, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, she married [[Herbert Biberman]], a theater director then associated with the Theatre Guild Acting Company; he became a [[film director]] and died in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;"A Theatre Guild Wedding: Gale Sondergaard, Actress, Bride of H.J. Biberman, Executive", ''The New York Times'', May 16, 1930.&lt;/ref&gt; They had two children, Daniel Hans Biberman and Mrs. Joan Campos.&lt;ref name="Nissen2007"/&gt;

Following several strokes, she died from cerebral vascular [[thrombosis]] in the [[Motion Picture &amp; Television Country House and Hospital|Motion Picture and Television Hospital]] in [[Woodland Hills, California]], in 1985, aged 86. She had been admitted to the hospital in 1982.&lt;ref name="Nissen2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Folkart"/&gt;

'''Genetic erosion''' (also known as '''genetic depletion''') is a process where the limited [[gene pool]] of an [[endangered species]] diminishes even more when reproductive individuals die off before reproducing [[Small population size|low population]]. The term is sometimes used in a narrow sense, such as when describing the loss of particular [[allele]]s or genes, as well as being used more broadly, as when referring to the loss of a phenotype or whole species.

Genetic erosion occurs because each individual organism has many unique genes which get lost when it dies without getting a chance to breed. Low genetic diversity in a population of wild animals and plants leads to a further diminishing gene pool&amp;nbsp;– inbreeding and a weakening immune system can then "fast-track" that species towards eventual [[extinction]].

By definition, endangered species suffer varying degrees of genetic erosion. Many species benefit from a human-assisted breeding program to keep their population viable,{{cn|date=December 2016}} thereby avoiding extinction over long time-frames. Small populations are more susceptible to genetic erosion than larger populations. 

Genetic erosion gets compounded and accelerated by habitat loss and [[habitat fragmentation]]&amp;nbsp;– many endangered species are threatened by habitat loss and (fragmentation) [[habitat]]. Fragmented habitat create barriers in gene flow between populations. 

The [[gene pool]] of a [[species]] or a [[population]] is the complete set of unique alleles that would be found by inspecting the genetic material of every living member of that species or population. A large gene pool indicates extensive [[genetic diversity]], which is associated with robust populations that can survive bouts of intense [[Selection (biology)|selection]]. Meanwhile, low genetic diversity (see [[inbreeding]] and [[population bottleneck]]s) can cause reduced [[fitness (biology)|biological fitness]] and increase the chance of [[extinction]] of that species or population.

==Processes and consequences==
Population bottlenecks create shrinking gene pools, which leave fewer and fewer fertile mating partners. The genetic implications can be illustrated by considering the analogy of a high-stakes poker game with a crooked dealer. Consider that the game begins with a 52-card deck (representing high genetic diversity). Reduction of the number of breeding pairs with unique genes resembles the situation where the dealer deals only the same five cards over and over, producing only a few limited "hands".

As specimens begin to inbreed, both physical and reproductive congenital effects and defects appear more often. Abnormal sperm increases, infertility rises, and birthrates decline. "Most perilous are the effects on the immune defense systems, which become weakened and less and less able to fight off an increasing number of bacterial, viral, fungal, parasitic, and other disease-producing threats. Thus, even if an endangered species in a bottleneck can withstand whatever human development may be eating away at its habitat, it still faces the threat of an epidemic that could be fatal to the entire population."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://lynx.uio.no/jon/lynx/obrien-e.htm |quote=A population bottleneck creates a shrinking gene pool that leaves fewer and fewer mating partners.

==Loss of agricultural and livestock biodiversity==
{{See also|Agricultural biodiversity}}
Genetic erosion in [[agricultural]] and [[livestock]] is the loss of biological genetic diversity&amp;nbsp;– including the loss of individual genes, and the loss of particular [[Genetic recombination|recombinants]] of genes (or gene complexes)&amp;nbsp;– such as those manifested in locally adapted [[landraces]] of [[domesticated]] animals or plants that have become adapted to the natural environment in which they originated.

The major driving forces behind genetic erosion in crops are variety replacement, land clearing, [[overexploitation]] of species, population pressure, [[environmental degradation]], [[overgrazing]], governmental policy, and changing agricultural systems. The main factor, however, is the replacement of local varieties of domestic plants and animals by other varieties or species that are non-local. A large number of varieties can also often be dramatically reduced when commercial varieties are introduced into traditional farming systems. Many researchers believe that the main problem related to agro-ecosystem management is the general tendency towards genetic and ecological uniformity imposed by the development of modern agriculture.

==Prevention by human intervention, modern science and safeguards==

===''In situ'' conservation===
With advances in modern bioscience, several techniques and safeguards have emerged to check the relentless advance of genetic erosion and the resulting acceleration of endangered species towards eventual extinction. However, many of these techniques and safeguards are too expensive yet to be practical, and so the best way to protect species is to protect their [[habitat]] and to let them live in it as naturally as possible.

[[Wildlife sanctuaries]] and [[national park]]s have been created to preserve entire [[ecosystem]]s with all the web of species native to the area. [[Wildlife corridor]]s are created to join fragmented habitats (see [[Habitat fragmentation]]) to enable endangered species to travel, meet, and breed with others of their kind. Scientific [[Wildlife conservation|conservation]] and modern [[wildlife management]] techniques, with the expertise of scientifically trained staff, help manage these protected ecosystems and the wildlife found in them. Wild animals are also [[Species translocation|translocated]] and [[Species reintroduction|reintroduced]] to other locations physically when fragmented wildlife habitats are too far and isolated to be able to link together via a wildlife corridor, or when local extinctions have already occurred.

===''Ex situ'' conservation===
Modern policies of [[zoo associations]] and [[zoo]]s around the world have begun putting dramatically increased emphasis on keeping and breeding wild-sourced [[species]] and [[subspecies]] of animals in their registered endangered species breeding programs. These specimens are intended to have a chance to be reintroduced and survive back in the wild. The main objectives of zoos today have changed, and greater resources are being invested in breeding species and subspecies for then ultimate purpose of assisting conservation efforts in the wild. Zoos do this by maintaining extremely detailed scientific breeding records (''i.e.'' [[studbook]]s)) and by loaning their wild animals to other zoos around the country (and often globally) for breeding, to safeguard against [[inbreeding]] by attempting to maximize genetic diversity however possible.

Costly (and sometimes controversial) [[ex-situ conservation]] techniques aim to increase the genetic [[biodiversity]] on our planet, as well as the diversity in local [[gene pool]]s. by guarding against genetic erosion. Modern concepts like [[seedbank]]s, [[sperm bank]]s, and [[tissue bank]]s have become much more commonplace and valuable. [[Sperm]], [[Egg (biology)|eggs]], and [[embryos]] can now be frozen and kept in banks, which are sometimes called "Modern Noah's Arks" or "[[Frozen Zoo]]s". [[Cryopreservation]] techniques are used to freeze these living materials and keep them alive in perpetuity by storing them submerged in [[liquid nitrogen]] tanks at very low temperatures. Thus, preserved materials can then be used for [[artificial insemination]], [[in vitro fertilization|''in vitro'' fertilization]], [[embryo transfer]], and [[cloning]] methodologies to protect diversity in the gene pool of critically endangered species.

It can be possible to save an [[endangered species]] from [[extinction]] by preserving only ''parts'' of specimens, such as tissues, sperm, eggs, etc.&amp;nbsp;– even after the death of a critically endangered animal, or collected from one found freshly dead, in [[captivity (animal)|captivity]] or from the [[Wilderness|wild]]. A new specimen can then be "resurrected" with the help of cloning, so as to give it another chance to breed its genes into the living population of the respective threatened species. Resurrection of dead critically endangered wildlife specimens with the help of cloning is still being perfected, and is still too expensive to be practical, but with time and further advancements in science and methodology it may well become a routine procedure not to far into the future.

Recently, strategies for finding an integrated approach to ''in situ'' and ''ex situ'' conservation techniques have been given considerable attention, and progress is being made.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.diverseeds.eu/forum/viewforum.php?f=14 DIVERSEEDS online discussion]{{dead link|date=January 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} forum on the integrated approach.{{deadlink|date=March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background and history==

At the 1976 annual meeting of the [[American Sociological Association]] (ASA), the founding organizational meeting of the Association for Humanist Sociology was held.&lt;ref name="Galliher"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nichols"/&gt;  The president of the ASA, [[Alfred McClung Lee]], having run into resistance against his efforts to reform the ASA, organized the formation of the AHS to be distinct and outside of the structure of the ASA.  The first issue of ''The Humanist Sociologist'' newsletter was published later that year, and the first issue of the ''Humanity &amp; Society'' journal was published in 1977, the only issue published that year.  Beginning in 1978, the journal was published quarterly.

With the journal's focus outside of mainstream sociology, article themes have included "human liberation", "unity and coalition building", "analysis of oppression and inequality", "studies of specific minority and disadvantaged minority groups" and "social change".&lt;ref name="Nichols"&gt;''Public Sociology: The Contemporary Debate''; edited by [[Lawrence T. Nichols]]; [[Transaction Publishers]] 2011; Pgs. 41-72&lt;/ref&gt;

The journal would also inform potential contributors that, "authors of articles will be asked to include information as to the primary moral and/or value commitments, as well as their commitments to any particular sociological paradigm ... [and] 'domain assumptions' that undergird their analyses."&lt;ref name="Galliher"/&gt;

The first editor of the journal was sociologist Charles P. Flynn.  Although Al and Betty Lee never exercised control or edited the journal, it reflected their concern for issues of injustice, human suffering and social activism.&lt;ref name="Galliher"/&gt; The quarterly ''The Humanist Sociologist'' newsletter was initially developed and edited by Richard H.Wells.&lt;ref&gt;''Sociology for People: Toward a Caring Profession'';  Alfred McClung Lee; [[Syracuse University Press]], 1990; Pgs. 202&lt;/ref&gt;

A review of the first two years of ''Humanity &amp; Society'' published in the ''[[Contemporary Sociology]]'' journal described how it seeks "to redraw the domain of sociological discourse, theoretically, philosophically, substantively, or ethically. They challenge the status quo and the dominant tendency of current publications. Thus they are more difficult to evaluate by conventional standards." According to this review, the journal and a couple journals like it show that the field of humanistic and interactionist sociology are active fields of inquiry, after neglect on the part of the major journals in sociology. The journal was described as having opened up previously restricted channels for qualitative sociologists to publish their empirical work.&lt;ref name="ASA-CS"&gt;Review: Thoughts On Five New Journals And Some Old Ones; Malcolm Spector, Robert R. Faulkner; ''[[Contemporary Sociology]]'' Vol. 9, No. 4, July, 1980, Pgs 477-482; [[American Sociological Association]]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jean-Julien Lemordant''' (28 June 1882 &amp;ndash; 11 June 1968) was a [[Breton people|Breton]] artist and [[France|French]] soldier and patriot.

==Life==
Lemordant was born in [[St. Malo]]. He grew up in [[Brittany]] and was orphaned in his teens.&lt;ref&gt;[http://musee-beauxarts.quimper.fr/htcoib/fjlemor.htm LEMORDANT Jean-Julien&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; At first he studied architecture but made his career as a painter, initially in Rennes and later in Paris, studying under [[Léon Bonnat]] at the [[École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts|Beaux-Arts]].

The life of [[Brittany]] figured prominently in his early paintings, including his paintings for the Hôtel de l'Épée dining rooms at Quimper, and for the ceiling of the Theatre of Rennes. He was associated with [[Charles Cottet]], and his influences included [[Paul Gauguin|Gauguin]], the [[Fauvism|Fauves]], and the [[Pont-Aven School|School of Pont-Aven]]. When his work was exhibited in [[Paris]], it was to broad critical acclaim.

==Blindness==
At the outset of [[World War I]], in August 1914, he volunteered for [[France]] and was sent to the front as a private. He was wounded at [[Charleroi]] and promoted to lieutenant. In October 1915 he was again wounded, at the [[Third Battle of Artois|battle of Artois]], and further wounds in the same battle left him blind. He was left for four days, thought dead, then was taken as prisoner to Germany. He was eventually exchanged and returned to France through [[Switzerland]].&lt;ref&gt;Anna Seaton Schmidt, "Jean Julien Lemordant", ''The American Magazine of Art'', vol. X, #10, August 1919, pp. 363-369.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gustave Geffroy &amp; Charles Le Goffic, ''Jean-Julien Lemordant, peintre et soldat'', Yale University School of Fine Arts, 1919.&lt;/ref&gt;

Embraced as a victim of German "Kultur", Lemordant became an inspirational speaker, talking about the effects of his blindness, and the role of the artist in society. He believed that France was victorious over [[Germany]] because a series of great artists ([[Eugène Anatole Carrière|Carrière]], [[Alfred Sisley|Sisley]], [[Camille Pissarro|Pissarro]], [[Pierre Puvis de Chavannes|Puvis de Chavannes]] and [[Auguste Rodin|Rodin]]) had kept the spirit of art and sacrifice alive in France. In 1919 he was awarded the [[Howland Memorial Prize]] and his works were exhibited at [[Yale University]]; the retrospective exhibit also was shown at the Gimple and Wildenstein Galleries in New York,&lt;ref&gt;''The New York Times, 23 March 1919.&lt;/ref&gt; and toured the United States under the auspices of the American Federation of Art. In 1926, he was made a Commandeur of the [[Légion d'honneur|Légion d'Honneur]], and was carried through the [[Grand Palais]] on the shoulders of the greatest artist of the day.

Lemordant was made Professor of Esthetics at the [[École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts|École des Beaux-Arts]], for life.

In 1927, he acquired a site on the Avenue-René-Coty, and designed, with the assistance of Jean Launay, the Hôtel Lemordant to be erected there. His living quarters contained a huge, naturally lit studio, which, being [[blindness|blind]], he never used.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Ayers, ''The Architecture of Paris'', Edition Axel Menges, Stuttgart, 2004, pp. 219-220. {{ISBN|3-930698-96-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later years==
Fifty years after his injuries, a series of operations restored his sight.

Ironically, Lemordant died of [[tear-gas]] poisoning during the [[May 1968 in France|May 1968 student uprisings in Paris]].

'''John Davenport''' (April 9, 1597 &amp;ndash; May 30, 1670) was an English [[Puritan]] clergyman and co-founder of the American colony of [[New Haven Colony|New Haven]].

==Early life==
Born in [[Coventry]], [[Warwickshire, England]] to a wealthy family, Davenport was educated at [[Oxford University]]. He [[matriculate]]d at [[Merton College, Oxford|Merton College]] in 1613 but migrated to [[Magdalen College, Oxford|Magdalen College]] two years later, eventually leaving Oxford before completing his degree.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stamfordhistory.org/dav_bremer1.htm Lecture by Francis J. Bremer, Ph.D., at the Stamford Historical Society, April 17, 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;

His father was [[Henry Davenport]] (1567 &amp;ndash; May 29, 1627),&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Millennium File |date=2003 |author=Heritage Consulting |publication-place=Provo, UT |publisher=Ancestry.com Operations Inc |access-date=2018-05-23 |website=Ancestry.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; draper, alderman, and mayor of [[Coventry]], son of Edward Davenport, mayor of Coventry (1551-2).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1509-1558/member/davenport-%2528damport%2529-edward-1504-87 |title=DAVENPORT (DAMPORT), Edward (by 1504-87), of Coventry, Warws. |date=1982 |website=www.historyofparliamentonline.org |access-date=2018-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; His mother was Winifred Barnaby (1569 - April 12, 1597).

==Career==
After serving as  [[chaplain]] of [[Hilton Castle]], he became [[curate]] of [[St Lawrence Jewry]] in [[London]]. In 1624, he was chosen [[vicar]] of St. Stephen's Church, in Coleman Street, London. In 1625, he returned to Oxford for further studies, receiving an MA and BD.&lt;ref&gt;Francis J. Bremer, "John Davenport: The American Career of an International Puritan," Lecture at the Stamford Historical Society, April 17, 2005; online at http://www.stamfordhistory.org/dav_bremer1.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  He became an associate of [[John Preston (clergyman)|John Preston]], a leading Puritan teacher and scholar, and edited his works for posthumous publication. His efforts to organize the re-purchase of "lay-[[impropriations]]" for the support of rural clergy were frustrated by Bishop [[William Laud]] and condemned by the Court of [[Exchequer]], as were also his efforts for the relief of Reformed clergy displaced by war in the [[Electorate of the Palatinate]]. In 1633 he resigned from the established church and moved to [[Holland]].

While in Holland, it is believed that he was the model for several portraits by Rembrandt, though these are now thought to be self-portraits of Rembrandt.

In 1637, he acquired the patent for a colony in [[Massachusetts]] and sailed with much of his congregation for [[Boston]]. While staying in Boston with Reverend [[John Cotton (Puritan)|John Cotton]] in March 1638, he sat during the church trial of [[Anne Hutchinson]] which resulted in her excommunication from the Boston church, ending the [[Antinomian Controversy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Battis |first=Emery |title=Saints and Sectaries: Anne Hutchinson and the Antinomian Controversy in the Massachusetts Bay Colony |publisher=University of North Carolina Press |place=Chapel Hill |year=1962|pages=232–248}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Later that month he co-founded the [[New Haven Colony|Colony of New Haven]] along with his classmate, [[Theophilus Eaton]], a wealthy merchant from London who became the colony's first governor. He was a large proponent of education in his colony and is often credited with the co-founding of [[Hopkins School]].&lt;ref name="hopchron"&gt;''Chronicles of Hopkins Grammar School: 1660-1935''. Thomas B Davis. Quinnipiack Press, New Haven, CT. 1938&lt;/ref&gt; As a [[burgess (title)|burgess]], he was an important figure in the colony up until his departure to Boston in 1668. He unsuccessfully opposed the incorporation of the New Haven colony into the reorganized colony of Connecticut under a royal charter in 1667.

Davenport was a lifelong advocate of the rigorous Puritan standards for church membership and for the strict qualifications for [[infant baptism]], which he believed should be administered only to the children of full church members. His time in Holland had been disrupted by a controversy with his supervising pastor [[John Paget (priest)|John Paget]] over this issue, and it led to his withdrawal from the Puritan church in Amsterdam. In New England, he was a staunch opponent of the recommendations made by the Synod of 1662, known as the [[Half-Way Covenant]], which proposed that the children of "half-way" members (those who had been baptized as infants but who had not given evidence of a "conversion" and been admitted to full membership) be allowed to receive baptism.&lt;ref&gt;Perry Miller, ''The New England Mind: From Colony to Province'' (Cambridge, 1953).&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1667, after the death of their pastor, John Wilson, the [[First Church in Boston]] invited Davenport to be their new pastor.&lt;ref&gt;Richard D. Pierce, ed., ''The Records of the First Church in Boston 1630–1868'' (Boston, 1961), p.62.&lt;/ref&gt; A minority in that church opposed the invitation, objecting to his rejection of the compromise on infant baptism. Convention required that Davenport secure a release from his former congregation before accepting a new post, and the church in New Haven was reluctant to let him go. Still, he moved to Boston in the spring of 1668, and eventually produced excerpts of a letter from the New Haven church that appeared to grant his release. He was installed as pastor of the First Church in December 1668, but a faction opposed to his appointment sought to withdraw from the church to form a new congregation. A council of clergy from local churches endorsed their request, and they formed the [[Old South Church|Third (or Old South) Church]] in May 1669.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur B. Ellis, ''History of the First Church in Boston, 1630–1880'' (Boston, 1881)&lt;/ref&gt; On May 19, 1669, Davenport preached the [http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/etas/53/ Election Sermon] before the [[Massachusetts General Court|General Court]] in Boston, using the occasion to condemn the actions of "Councils" that interfered with the liberty and administration of individual congregations. Perhaps instigated by this sermon, the Deputies (the lower house of the General Court) named a commission to investigate the actions of the founders of the Third Church and the ministers who had endorsed the separation. However, the Assistants (the upper house) blocked any action, including the publication of Davenport's sermon at public expense. Later that summer, it was discovered that the release letter from New Haven had been severely redacted to give an impression that was not perhaps warranted, though Davenport's First Church rejected charges that they had been misrepresented.&lt;ref&gt;Robert G. Pope, ''The Half-way Covenant: Church Membership in Puritan New England'' (Princeton, 1969).&lt;/ref&gt;

Davenport's appointment to the leading church in New England and his inflammatory election sermon brought to a head the simmering disagreements over the compromise settlement of the Half-way Synod. But Davenport died the following year; [[Increase Mather]], the other leading Anti-Synodist, experienced a change of heart; and Synodist deputies swept the election of 1671, ending the temporary crisis.

Davenport died in Boston of [[apoplexy]] on March 15, 1670, and was buried in the same tomb as [[John Cotton (puritan)|John Cotton]] in [[King's Chapel Burying Ground]], Boston.

[[Yale University]] was envisioned by Davenport, although his proposal for it would not be realized until some 30 years after his death.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.library.yale.edu/mssa/YHO/Piersons/beginnings.html ''Yale: A Short History'']&lt;/ref&gt; [[Davenport College]] is named in his honor and an oil portrait of him (above) is in the Yale collection. He was also instrumental in the founding of [[Hopkins School]], a grammar school, in 1660.

Notable descendants include [[Abraham Davenport]], of [[John Greenleaf Whittier]]'s "[[s:Abraham Davenport|Dark Day]]" poem; brothers John and James Davenport, who were Congressmen; [[Claude Davenport]]; [[Archibald Cox]], the [[Watergate]] Special Prosecutor; and [[Maxwell Perkins]], the editor.

{{redirect|Skullcup|other uses|Skull cup}}

A '''kapala''' ([[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]] for "skull") or '''skullcup''' is a cup made from a human skull and used as a ritual implement (bowl) in both [[Hindu]] [[Tantra]] and [[Buddhist]] [[Tantra]] ([[Vajrayana]]). Especially in Tibet, they are often carved or elaborately mounted with precious metals and jewels. 

[[Image:Kapala skull cup.jpg|thumb|right|Tibetan carved kapala]]

[[File:Kapala.JPG|thumbnail|Kapala]]

==Nomenclature, orthography and etymology==
'Kapala' ({{bo|t=ཀ་པ་ལ|w=kapala}}) is a [[loan word]] into Tibetan from Sanskrit ''kapāla'' ([[Devanagari]]: कपाल) referring to the skull or forehead, usually of a human. By association, it refers to the ritual skullcup fashioned out of a human cranium.

== Vajrayana deities ==
[[Image:Chakrasamvara Vajravarahi.jpg|thumb|right|The Buddhist Deities [[Chakrasamvara]] and [[Vajravarahi]], circa 15th century Painting Kapala is seen on one of the left hands]]
Many of the deities of [[Vajrayana]], including [[mahasiddha]]s, [[dakini]]s and [[dharmapala]]s, are depicted as carrying the kapala, usually in their left hand. Some deities such as the Hindu [[Chinnamasta]] and the related Buddhist [[Vajrayogini]] are depicted as drinking blood from the kapala.&lt;ref&gt;Benard, Elisabeth Anne (1994). ''Chinnamasta: The Aweful Buddhist and Hindu Tantric Goddess''. Delhi: Motilal Barnarsidass. {{ISBN|81-208-1065-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hindu deities ==
Hindu deities that may be depicted with the kapala include [[Durga]], [[Kālī]] and [[Shiva]], especially in his [[Bhairava]] form. Even [[Ganesha]], when adopted into Tibetan Buddhism as Maharakta [[Ganapati]], is shown with a kapala filled with blood. 

Some of the Hindu deities pictured thus are:

a) [[Kālī]], pictured in the most common four-armed iconographic image, shows each hand carrying variously a sword, a [[trishula]] (trident), a severed head, and a bowl or skullcup (kapala) catching the blood of the severed head.

b) The [[Chamunda]], a form of [[Durga]], seen in the [[Halebidu]] temple built by the [[Hoysala]], is described as wearing a garland of severed heads or skulls ([[Mundamala]]). She is described as having four, eight, ten, or twelve arms, holding a [[damaru]] (drum), trishula (trident), sword, a snake ([[nāga]]), skull-mace ([[khatvanga]]), thunderbolt ([[vajra]]), a severed head and panapatra (drinking vessel, wine cup) or skullcup (kapala), filled with blood.

[[File:Kapala Mala courtesy The WOVENSOULS collection.jpg|thumb|Kapala Mala, 19th century, Tibet, courtesy of the Wovensouls collection]]

In Tibetan monasteries a kapala is used symbolically to hold bread or dough cakes, [[torma]], and wine instead of blood and flesh as offerings to wrathful deities, such as the ferocious [[Dharmapāla]] ("defender of the faith"). The dough cakes are shaped to resemble human eyes, ears and tongues. The ''kapala'' is made in the form of a skull, specially collected and prepared. It is elaborately anointed and consecrated before use. The cup is also elaborately decorated and kept in a triangular pedestal. The heavily embossed cup is usually made of [[silver-gilt]] bronze with lid shaped like a skull and with a handle made in the form of a thunderbolt.&lt;ref name=EB&gt;''Encyclopædia Britannica''. [http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9044643/kapala Kapala]&lt;/ref&gt;

Kapalas are used mainly for esoteric purposes such as rituals. Among the rituals using kapalas are higher tantric meditation to achieve a transcendental state of thought and mind within the shortest possible time; libation to gods and deities to win their favor; by Tibetan Lamas as an offering bowl on the altar, being filled with wine or blood as a gift to the Yidam Deity or all the Deities; and the [[Vajrayana]] empowerment ceremony.

== Charnel ground or sky burial ==
{{Main|Sky burial}}
The kapala is one of several charnel ground implements made from human bone found by tantrics at sky burial sites.
[[Image:Sky burial site, Yerpa Valley.JPG|thumb|left| Sky burial site in Yerpa valley in Tibet where kapalas are searched for by tantric practitioners]]

The charnel ground, an ancient Tibetan burial custom, is distinctly different from the customs of graveyards and cremation, but all three of them have been a part of the home ground of [[tantra|tantric]] practitioners’ such as the yogis and yoginis, Shaiva Kapalikas and Aghoris, shamans and sadhus. The charnel ground, often referred to as "sky burial" by Western sources, is an area demarcated specifically in Tibet, defined by the Tibetan word Jhator (literal meaning is ’giving alms to the birds’), a way of  exposing the corpse to nature, where human bodies are disposed as it were or in a chopped (chopped after the rituals) condition in the open ground as a ritual that has great religious meaning of the ascent of the mind to be reincarnated into another circle of life. Such a practice results in finding human bones, half or whole skeletons, more or less putrefying corpses and disattached limbs lying scattered around. Items made from human skulls or bones are found in the sky burial grounds by the [[Sadhus]] and Yogins of the tantric cult. The charnel grounds are also known by the epithets the "field of death" or the  "valley of corpses". In Tibet,  a class distinction in the burial practices is also noted. The dead High Lamas are buried in [[Stupa]]s or cremated but the dead commoners are disposed of in the Charnel ground or in a Sky burial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yoniversum.nl/dakini/charnel_g.html|title=Charnel- and Cremation Grounds|first=Rufus C.|last=Camphausen|website=www.yoniversum.nl|accessdate=15 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.travelchinaguide.com/cityguides/tibet/sky-buria.htm|title=Sky Burial, Tibetan Religious Ritual, Funeral Party|website=www.travelchinaguide.com|accessdate=15 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The products from the charnel ground are the charnel ground ornaments such as the i) Crown of five skulls, ii) Bone necklace, iii) Bone armlets, iv)  Bone bracelets, v) Bone skirt and vi) Bone anklets which decorate  many images of dakinis, yoginis, dharmapalas and a few other deities (as may be seen in some of the pictures and stone images depicted in the gallery here), and other products such as the Bone trumpet, the Skull cup and Skull drum used by the tantric practitioners. Kapala or the skull cup is thus a produce from the Charnel ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yoniversum.nl/dakini/charnel_o.html|title=Charnel Ground Ornaments and Implements|first=Rufus C.|last=Camphausen|website=www.yoniversum.nl|accessdate=15 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lodovico Altieri''' (17 July 1805 &amp;ndash; 11 August 1867) was an [[Italian people|Italian]] [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]].&lt;ref name=CH&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www2.fiu.edu/~mirandas/bios1840.htm|title=Consistory of December 14, 1840 (XVI)|author=Salvador Miranda|date=|publisher=The Cardinals of the Holy Roman Church|accessdate=1 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He served in various capacities under various popes and belonged to a [[Altieri family|noble Roman house]] making him a descendant of [[Pope Clement X]].

The sainthood process commenced under [[Pope Benedict XVI]] and the late cardinal has been titled as a [[Servant of God]].

==Life==
Lodovico Altieri was born in [[Rome]] in 1805 as the last of three children to Paluzzo Altieri (21.07.1760-10.01.1834) and Maria Anna von Sachsen (20.10.1770-24.12.1845). His two older siblings were Clemente (06.08.1795-21.06.1873) and Augusto (1797-1860) who became a [[Jesuit]]. His father served from 1801 until his death as the commander for the [[Noble Guard (Vatican)|Papal Noble Guard]] after [[Pope Pius VII]] named him to that position. His brother Clemente succeeded their father in that role. He was [[baptized]] in the parish of San Marco mere moments after his birth.

He was [[ordained]] to the [[priesthood]] in Rome on 24 March 1833.

He was named after his ordination as the qualificator for the [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith|Congregation of the Inquisition]] while he served as the vicar for the [[Santa Maria in Via Lata]] school.&lt;ref name=CH/&gt; During this time he also served as the aide for the [[Congregation for Catholic Education|Congregation of Studies]]. His rise through the ranks continued after he was appointed as the [[Catholic archdiocese of Ephesus|Titular Archbishop of Ephesus]]; he received his [[episcopal consecration]] from the pope himself in [[Saint Peter's Basilica]]. The [[co-consecrators]] were [[Giovanni Soglia Ceroni]] and Giovanni Giacomo Sinibaldi.

He was also appointed as the [[apostolic nuncio]] to [[Habsburg Monarchy|Austria]] just after his consecration.&lt;ref name=CH/&gt; His aide in the nunciature was the future cardinal [[Gaetano Bedini]]. It was he who encouraged Bedini to expose himself to the Church's diplomatic atmosphere.

The pope created him as a cardinal but reserved him [[in pectore]] on 14 December 1840. His name was not announced until 21 April 1845 and he was made the [[Santa Maria in Campitelli|Cardinal-Priest of Santa Maria in Campitelli]] (the diaconate was elevated [[pro hac vice]] to a titular rank).&lt;ref name=CH/&gt;

He participated in the [[Papal conclave, 1846|conclave in 1846]] that elected [[Pope Pius IX]].&lt;ref name=CH/&gt; In that conclave he supported the candidature of Cardinal Mastai-Ferretti which formed a knit group among cardinals such as [[Clarissimo Falconieri Mellini]] and [[Luigi Amat di San Filippo e Sorso]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citebook|first=George|last=Fitz-Hardinge Berkeley|title=Italy in the Making: 1815 to 1846|date=1932|publisher=Cambridge University Press|accessdate=1 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a member of the [[triumvirate]] that governed Rome between 1849 and 1850 after the short-lived [[Roman Republic (19th century)|Roman Republic]] together with cardinals Luigi Vannicelli Casoni and [[Gabriele della Genga Sermattei|Gabriele Sermattei della Genga]]. The disorder in 1848 saw Altieri flee with Pius IX to [[Gaeta]]. Pius IX held Altieri in great esteem and Altieri proved himself the center of opposition within the cardinalate to [[Giacomo Antonelli]].

He was the aide for the Congregation for Memorials from 1855 to 1857 and was later appointed [[Camerlengo of the Holy Roman Church]] on 19 March 1857; the cardinal held that position until his death.&lt;ref name=CH/&gt; He later opted for the order of [[Cardinal-Bishop|Cardinal-Bishops]] and assumed the [[suburbicarian see]] of [[Suburbicarian See of Albano|Albano]] on 17 December 1860. He was later appointed as the [[Congregation of the Index|Prefect of the Congregation of the Index]] on 5 September 1861 and then appointed as the [[Archpriest|archpriest]] for the [[Basilica of Saint John Lateran]] on 8 March 1863.&lt;ref name=CH/&gt; Altieri had little interactions with [[John Bosco|Saint Giovanni Bosco]] and once sent him in 1867 funds for Bosco's apostolic work in [[Turin]].

During the [[cholera]] epidemic that affected his suburbicarian see he assisted and tended to the ill though contracted it himself and died of it later on 11 August 1867. His funeral took place in [[Santa Maria in Campitelli]] and his remains were interred in [[Campo Verano]] before being transferred.&lt;ref name=CH/&gt;

==Beatification process==
The beatification process commenced under [[Pope Benedict XVI]] once the [[Congregation for the Causes of Saints]] issued the official "[[nihil obstat]]" (no objections) and titled him as a [[Servant of God]] on 14 March 2009. The diocesan process of the investigation was inaugurated in Albano on 22 November 2009 and concluded its investigations later on 26 September 2015.

The current [[postulator]] for this cause is Dr. Ulderico Parente.

'''Lucius Aemilius Papus''' ([[floruit|fl.]] 216 BC) was a Roman general and statesman. He jointly commanded the Roman armies which defeated the [[Gaul]]s at the [[Battle of Telamon]] in 225 BC; his co-Consul, [[Gaius Atilius Regulus (consul 225 BC)|Gaius Atilius Regulus]] was killed during the battle. Papus was honoured with a [[roman triumph|triumph]] for this victory. He subsequently held several senior positions. He belonged to the [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]] ''[[gens]] [[Aemilia (gens)|Aemilia]]''.

== Ancestry ==
William Smith says that Papus was the grandson of [[Quintus Aemilius Papus]], himself the grandson of (a different) Quintus Aemilius Papus. His grandfather had been [[Roman consul|consul]] twice and [[Roman censor|censor]] once.&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;William Smith. (1870). [http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/2453.html "Papus - Q. Aemilius Papus"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514091238/http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/2453.html |date=May 14, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
[[File:Talamone - Vista dalla giannella.JPG|thumb|The hills around the site of the [[Battle of Telamon]]]]
Papus was consul for 225, with [[Gaius Atilius Regulus (consul 225 BC)|Gaius Atilius Regulus]] as his colleague.&lt;ref name="Smith" /&gt; That year the [[Boii]], [[Insubres]] and [[Taurisci]] of [[Cisalpine Gaul]] enlisted the aid of the mercenary [[Gaesatae]] and mobilised against Rome. Papus was stationed at Ariminum (modern [[Rimini, Italy|Rimini]]) to guard against them. Regulus' army was at this time stationed in [[Sardinia]]. A smaller force of Roman allies was stationed on the border of [[Etruria]] under a [[praetor]], and it was this force that encountered the Gauls first, suffering a defeat at [[Battle of Faesulae|Faesulae]] (modern [[Fiesole]]). Papus arrived shortly after the battle and this persuaded the Gauls to withdraw along the coast.{{sfn|Goldworthy|2000|p=139}}

Meanwhile, Regulus had crossed from Sardinia, landed at Pisa, and was marching towards Rome. His scouts met the Celts' advance guard head-on near Telamon (modern Talamone), in an area called Campo Regio, to the surprise of both. As soon as they realised that they faced a second full Roman army they deployed their infantry facing both front and rear, with their flanks protected by wagons and chariots. The [[Battle of Telamon|fighting was fierce]], with Regulus being killed early in the battle and his head brought to the Celtic leaders. Eventually, the surrounded Gauls were worn down and broke. Most of their cavalry fled, but forty thousand Gauls are reported to have died with ten thousand being taken prisoner.{{sfn|Mommsen|2015|p=689}} The Romans lost six thousand killed and many more wounded.{{sfn|Perrett|1992|p=289}} After the battle Papus marched the army into [[Liguria]] and the territory of the [[Boii]] to conduct punitive actions. The defeat of the Gauls was so heavy that they never threatened Rome again. Papus was awarded the honour of a [[Roman triumph|triumph]].{{sfn|Goldworthy|2000|p=139}}&lt;ref&gt;[[Polybius]], [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Polybius/2*.html#21 'The Histories of Polybius'], Book 2. pp. 21–31.&lt;/ref&gt;

Papus was censor in 220, with [[Gaius Flaminius]] as his colleague.&lt;ref&gt;[[Livy]]. (1905). ''From the Founding of the City'', [[s:From the Founding of the City/Book 23#23|Book 23.23]]&lt;/ref&gt; In 218 he was one of five men sent as an embassy to [[Carthage]] following [[Hannibal]]'s [[siege of Saguntum]]. The embassy was sent to obtain satisfaction for the capture and destruction of the city, which had been under Rome's protection. The mission ended with the Roman delegation declaring war on the floor of the Carthaginian senate and so starting the [[Second Punic War]].{{sfn|Goldworthy|2000|p=145}}&lt;ref&gt;[[Livy]]. (1905). ''From the Founding of the City'', [[s:From the Founding of the City/Book 21#18|Book 21.18]]&lt;/ref&gt; In 216 Papus was one of the ''[[triumviri]]'' appointed to deal with Rome's lack of money during the war.&lt;ref&gt;[[Livy]]. (1905). ''From the Founding of the City'', [[s:From the Founding of the City/Book 23#21|Book 23.21]]&lt;/ref&gt;

There are no surviving records of when Papus died, nor of whether he left any surviving children.

The '''''Cemfjord''''' was a Cyprus-registered cargo ship which foundered in the [[Pentland Firth]] off the north-east coast of [[Scotland]] on 2 January 2015. Built as the general cargo ship '''''Margareta''''' in 1984, she was converted to carry cement in 1998 and was en route from [[Aalborg]], [[Denmark]] to [[Runcorn]], [[Cheshire]], United Kingdom when she capsized in bad weather and sank in {{convert|270|ft|m|order=flip}} of water. All eight crew were presumed lost. No bodies were recovered, and the ship has been left as a sea grave.

==Description==
The ship was {{convert|83.13|m|ftin}} long overall, with a beam of {{convert|11.34|m|ftin}}. She had a draught of {{convert|4.40|m|ftin}} and a height of {{convert|21.00|m|ftin}}. The ship was assessed at {{GT|1850}},&lt;ref name=Brise/&gt; {{DWT|2327}},&lt;ref name=Seanews132164/&gt; 661 [[net tonnage|NT]].&lt;ref name=Brise/&gt;

She was powered by a [[KHD|Klöckner-Humboldt-Deutz]] 6M 628 [[diesel engine]] which produced {{convert|1175|kW|hp}} at 790 rpm. The engine was a [[four-stroke engine]] with six cylinders of 240mm diameter by 280mm stroke.&lt;ref name=Scheepvaartwest/&gt; It drove a screw propeller, which could propel her at {{convert|10|kn|km/h}}. The ship was also equipped with a 136-kilowatt (182-horsepower) [[bow thruster]].&lt;ref name=Brise&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.brise.de/download/details/Cemfjord.pdf |title=CEMFJORD |publisher=Baltrader Schiffahrt |location=Hamburg |accessdate=4 January 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150104162004/http://www.brise.de/download/details/Cemfjord.pdf |archivedate=4 January 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The ship was built as yard number 126 by Detlef Hegemann Rolandwerft [[GmbH]], [[Bremen]], [[West Germany]]. Her keel was laid on 15 February 1984 and she was launched as the general cargo ship ''Margareta'' on 31 August. Completion was in November 1984. She was allocated the [[IMO Number]] 8403569. Her call sign was DCOG.  She had a cargo capacity of 72 [[twenty-foot equivalent unit]]. ''Margareta'' was built for Thekla Schepers KG and operated under the management of MS Margareta &amp; Co, [[Haren, Germany|Haren]], [[West Germany]]. In May 1995 she was sold to the Margareta – Shark Shipping Co NV, [[Willemstad]], [[Netherlands Antilles]] and placed under the management of Briese Schiffahrts GMBH &amp; Co KG, [[Bremen]], Germany.&lt;ref name=Scheepvaartwest&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scheepvaartwest.be/CMS/index.php/general-cargo/1612-cemfjord-imo-8403569 |title=Cemfjord – IMO8403659 |publisher=Scheepvaartwest |accessdate=4 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1998, she was converted to a cement carrier by [[Morska Stocznia Remontowa]] S.A., [[Świnoujście]], [[Poland]]. Pneumatic equipment was installed which enabled her to self load and self discharge. She was allocated the call sign P3ZG9.&lt;ref name=Brise/&gt; She was owned and operated by Brise Bereederung, [[Hamburg]], Germany.&lt;ref name=Seanews132164/&gt;

Following an inspection at Runcorn, Cheshire, on 15 December 2013, ''Cemfjord'' was detained due to deficiencies found. The launch apparatus for her [[lifeboat (shipboard)|lifeboats]] was inoperative and her safety management did not meet the required standard. There were nine other deficiencies of a lesser nature. She was released from detention on 18 December 2013.&lt;ref name=Shipworld&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.shipworld.org/casualties-archive/casualties-january-2014/ |title=CASUALTIES – JANUARY 2014 |publisher=Shipworld |date=31 January 2014 |accessdate=4 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At 22:14 on 29 July 2014, ''Cemfjord'' ran aground in the [[Kattegat]] off [[Læsø]], Denmark. The authorities were contacted at 01:47 on 30 July and the ship was refloated later that day. Her Russian captain was subsequently convicted of being drunk in charge of the vessel. He was fined [[Danish krone|DKK 10,000]] by a Danish court. A new Polish captain was appointed to take charge of the ship.&lt;ref name=Seanews132164&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.seanews.com.tr/article/ACCIDENTS/132164/Cemfjord/ |title=Drunk master ran cement carrier aground off Denmark |publisher=SeaNews Turkey |date=31 July 2014 |accessdate=4 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2014, a second Russian captain in command of ''Cemfjord'' was convicted by [[Stavanger District Court|a court]] in [[Stavanger]], Norway. The court sentenced him to 35 days imprisonment for steering his ship while being intoxicated, and banned him from being in charge of a ship in Norwegian waters for two years.&lt;ref name=Seanews133696&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.seanews.com.tr/article/worldship/133696/Cemfjord-drunk-captain/ |title=35 days imprisonment for drunken Russian captain |publisher=SeaNews Turkey |date=29 August 2014 |accessdate=4 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sinking===

On her last voyage, ''Cemfjord'' was carrying 2,000 tonnes of cement from Aalborg in Denmark to Runcorn in Cheshire and was due to arrive on 5 January 2015.&lt;ref name=BBC30670842&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-north-east-orkney-shetland-30670842|title=Crew of eight feared lost as cargo ship Cemfjord sinks|publisher=BBC News Online|date=4 January 2015 |accessdate=4 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was last sighted at 13:00 on 2 January 2015 in the Pentland Firth. At 14:30 on 3 January,&lt;ref name=BBC30667084&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-highlands-islands-30667084 |title=Major search after ship overturns off north of Scotland |publisher=BBC News Online |date=3 January 2015 |accessdate=4 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; her upturned hull was sighted {{convert|11|nmi|km}} east of the [[Pentland Skerries]] by the [[NorthLink Ferries|NorthLink]] [[ferry]] {{MV|Hrossey||2}}, which was sailing from [[Shetland]] to [[Aberdeen]]. Only the bow was visible above the waves. The ferry searched for survivors for two and a half hours pending the arrival of [[lifeboat (rescue)|lifeboats]].&lt;ref name=WMN148569&gt;{{cite web |url=http://worldmaritimenews.com/archives/148569/eight-missing-after-cement-carrier-sinks-off-scotland/ |title=Eight Missing after Cement Carrier Sinks off Scotland |publisher=World Maritime News |accessdate=4 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; No distress call had been received and the weather at the time was bad, with storm force winds. There was no trace of her eight crew, comprising seven Poles and a Filipino. The Longhope, Scrabster, Stromness and Wick lifeboats were launched. Two helicopters and an aircraft also joined the search for the missing crew members,&lt;ref name=BBC30667084/&gt; as did {{HMS|Somerset|F82|6}}.&lt;ref name=Orcadian&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orcadian.co.uk/2015/01/missing-crew-search-suspended/ |title=Missing crew search suspended |publisher=The Orcadian |accessdate=4 January 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150104203706/http://www.orcadian.co.uk/2015/01/missing-crew-search-suspended/ |archivedate=4 January 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; By mid-afternoon on 4 January, the ship had sunk entirely.&lt;ref name="DR-5-1-2015"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/cargo-ship-sinking-lifeboat-crew-4920338|title=Cargo ship sinking: Lifeboat crew fear eight men died trapped inside their ship as search fails to find them|work=Daily Record|last=Gall|first=Charlie|date=5 January 2015|accessdate=5 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Marine Accident Investigation Branch]] (MAIB) conducted an investigation into the sinking.&lt;ref name=MAIB&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/maib-investigations-launched|title=MAIB investigators deployed to Pentland Firth and to the Solent |publisher=Marine Accident Investigation Branch |accessdate=29 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; An MAIB underwater survey located the vessel on the seabed at a depth of around {{convert|270|ft|order=flip}},&lt;ref name="PJ21-Feb-2015" /&gt; {{convert|12|mi|km}} east of [[Muckle Skerry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.orcadian.co.uk/2015/02/cemfjord-wreck-survey-is-complete/|title=Cemfjord wreck survey is complete|work=The Orcadian|date=10 February 2015|accessdate=29 July 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150817215351/http://www.orcadian.co.uk/2015/02/cemfjord-wreck-survey-is-complete/|archivedate=17 August 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The wreck was found to be intact but inverted and resting on its superstructure; no evidence was observed of structural failure.&lt;ref name="PJ21-Feb-2015"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.pressandjournal.co.uk/fp/news/highlands/497925/no-sign-of-cemfjord-bodies-during-survey-say-investigators/|title=No sign of Cemfjord bodies during survey, say investigators|last=Candlish|first=Jane|work=The Press and Journal|location=Aberdeen|date=21 February 2015|accessdate=29 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is thought that the ''Cemfjord'' may have been overwhelmed so quickly by bad weather that the crew did not have time to evacuate.&lt;ref name="DR-5-1-2015" /&gt; No bodies were seen or recovered during the survey or subsequently. The ship's owner, Brise of Hamburg, has said that no attempt to raise the wreck would be made and it will be left as a sea grave.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.pressandjournal.co.uk/fp/news/highlands/628027/families-of-seamen-lost-on-the-cemfjord-honour-loved-ones/|title=Families of seamen lost on the Cemfjord honour loved ones|last=Kerr|first=David|work=The Press and Journal|location=Aberdeen|date=4 July 2015|accessdate=29 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Less than two months prior to her sinking, on 7 October 2014 ''Cemfjord'' was left with a list in the [[Pentland Firth]], after her cargo shifted. The list was corrected by ballasting the ship. Contrary to regulations, the incident was not reported to the MAIB, although an internal investigation was carried out by Brise Breederungs, the ship's managers.&lt;ref name=Final&gt;{{cite web |url=https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/media/571760fee5274a22d300001e/MAIBInvReport_8_2016.pdf |title=Report on the investigation of the capsize and sinking of the cement carrier Cemfjord in the Pentland Firth, Scotland with the loss of all eight crew on 2 and 3 January 2015 |publisher=Marine Accident Investigation Branch |date=April 2016 |accessdate=21 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chief of Naval Staff==
{{Main|Karachi affair|l1=Agosta Submarines Scandal}}
In 1992, [[Rear-Admiral]] Haq was promoted to [[Three-star rank|three-star]] assignment, and was appointed as [[secondment]] at the [[Pakistan National Shipping Corporation|National Shipping Corporation]] (PNSC) by then-[[Chief of Naval Staff (Pakistan)|Chief of Naval Staff]] Admiral [[Saeed Mohammad Khan|S.M. Khan]]. However, his chairmanship was caught between the [[Privatization in Pakistan|privatization policy]] led by then-[[Prime Minister of Pakistan|Prime Minister]] [[Nawaz Sharif]] and Admiral [[Saeed Mohammad Khan|S.M. Khan]], when a civilian bureaucrat filed a petition against his tenureship at the [[Sindh High Court]].{{rp|contents}}&lt;ref name="Vij Books India Pvt Ltd, Prasad"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Prasad|first1=Dr Nitin|title=Contemporary Pakistan: Political System, Military and Changing Scenario|date=2016|publisher=Vij Books India Pvt Ltd|isbn=9789385505270|url=https://books.google.com/?id=FLufCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT54&amp;dq=mansurul+haq+vice+admiral#v=onepage&amp;q=mansurul%20haq%20vice%20admiral&amp;f=false|accessdate=23 August 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Vice-Admiral]] Haq fiercely opposed any attempts of [[Privatization in Pakistan|privatization policy]], causing a stress on the [[civil-military relations]] with the [[Government of Pakistan|civilian federal government]].{{rp|contents}}&lt;ref name="Vij Books India Pvt Ltd, Prasad"/&gt; In 1992, Vice-Admiral Haq announced to sell off the old metal scrap that would raise the revenue of [[United States Dollar|US$]]50–60&amp;nbsp;million to buy new [[cargo ship]]s.{{rp|4}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Lloyd's List Maritime Asia|date=1994|publisher=Lloyd's of London Press|url=https://books.google.com/?id=e7u1AAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=mansurul+haq+vice+admiral&amp;q=mansurul+haq|accessdate=23 August 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, [[Prime Minister of Pakistan|Prime Minister]] [[Benazir Bhutto]] publicly announced to promote [[Vice-Admiral]] Haq as a [[four-star admiral]] in the Navy, appointing him as the [[Chief of Naval Staff (Pakistan)|Chief of Naval Staff]].{{rp|35}}&lt;ref name="AuthorHouse, Anwar"/&gt; The promotion came with controversy since Vice-Admiral Mansur was due retirement a month before the change was due.{{rp|35}}&lt;ref name="AuthorHouse, Anwar"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Anwar|first1=Muhammad|last2=Baig|first2=Ebad|title=Pakistan: Time for Change|date=2012|publisher=AuthorHouse|isbn=9781477250303|pages=160|url=https://books.google.com/?id=mb6OOYcrIOYC&amp;pg=PA35&amp;lpg=PA35&amp;dq=mansurul+haq++appointed+chief+Bhutto#v=onepage&amp;q=mansurul%20haq%20%20appointed%20chief%20Bhutto&amp;f=false|accessdate=23 August 2017|language=en|format=google books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although, it was Admiral [[Saeed Mohammad Khan]] who had given a go-ahead of procuring the [[technology transfer]] of the [[Agosta 90B class submarine|Agosta 90B submarines]] in 1994 against his discretionary and wanting to directly procure the [[Upholder/Victoria-class submarine|Victoria class]] submarines. Admiral Haq, nonetheless oversaw the financial deals closed in between the [[Bainazir Bhuttoo Government|Benazir administration]] and the administrations of [[François Mitterrand|Mitterrand]] and [[Jacques Chirac|Chirac]] in 1994–97.&lt;ref name="News International, 2011"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Editorial|first1=et.al.|title=PPP govt, not Navy, purchased French subs, in a deal|url=https://www.thenews.com.pk/archive/print/617254-ppp-govt,-not-navy,-purchased-french-subs,-in-a-deal|accessdate=29 August 2017|work=www.thenews.com.pk|agency=News International|publisher=News International 2011|date=12 October 2011|location=Islamabad|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995, Adm.

==Dismissal and extradition==

In 1996–97, the [[Naval Intelligence (Pakistan)|Naval Intelligence]] led by [[Rear-Admiral]] [[Tanvir Ahmed (admiral)|Tanvir Ahmed]] began investigating the allegations and rumors at the [[NHQ (Pakistan Navy)|Navy NHQ]] surrounding the role of Admiral [[Saeed Mohammad Khan|S.M.

[[Saeed Mohammad Khan|SM Khan]] and others were also implicated, including the role of Aamir Lodhi, an [[arms dealer]] based in France who is also brother of Dr. [[Maleeha Lodhi]], currently serving as [[Permanent Representative of Pakistan to the United Nations|Permanent Representative of Pakistan]] to the [[United Nations]].&lt;ref name="South Asian Tribune, 2003"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Special Report|title=Musharraf Fires US Spy Agency for Pushing Amir Lodhi's Arrest:Maleeha's Fugitive Brother Allowed to Sneak Away from Embassy in Washington|url=http://antisystemic.org/satribune/www.satribune.com/archives/nov9_15_03/P1_maleeha.htm|accessdate=8 September 2017|work=antisystemic.org|agency=South Asian Tribune|publisher=South Asian Tribune, 2003|date=5 November 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though, Adm. [[Saeed Mohammad Khan|SM Khan]] denied his role in such deals as the latter wanted to purchase the [[Upholder/Victoria-class submarine]]s in 1994.&lt;ref name="News International, 2011" /&gt;

In 2010, [[Commodore (rank)|Cdre]] Shahid Ashraf, the [[Director-General|DG]] [[Naval Intelligence|NI]] under Admiral Haq, revealed on the [[Dawn News]] that the submarine deal, for which Admiral Mansurul Haq pleaded guilty, was signed before he took charge as Chief of Naval Staff.&lt;ref name="The News International 2010"&gt;{{cite news|last1=staff writer|first1=editorial|title=DG Naval Intelligence ready to spill the beans|url=https://www.thenews.com.pk/archive/print/610048-dg-naval-intelligence-ready-to-spill-the-beans|accessdate=8 September 2017|work=www.thenews.com.pk|agency=The News International|publisher=The News International|date=10 November 2010|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shahid Ashraf further claimed that Admiral Haq was not part of the selection team which recommended [[Agosta class submarine|Agosta 90B]] for purchase from France.&lt;ref name="The News International 2010"/&gt; The selection was made during Admiral [[Saeed Mohammad Khan]].&lt;ref name="The News International 2010"/&gt; The selection committee included various Admirals including those who subsequently held senior positions after Admiral Haq was removed from his position. However, Shahid Ashraf did not put forward any evidence that proved Haq's innocence.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|sL-TbIpotLs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2010, [[French police|French investigators]] raided the house of Amir Lodhi, and handed over the important documents relating the defence deals to the [[National Accountability Bureau|NAB]]. The reports confiscated by the French investigators revealed to have found in regards involvement of former [[President of Pakistan|President]] [[Asif Ali Zardari]] who had have received [[Euros|€]]33 million while Amir Lodhi's share was [[Euros|€]]2.9&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nation.com.pk/pakistan-news-newspaper-daily-english-online/Politics/15-Jan-2011/Zardari-pocketed-millions-in-French-subs-deal-report "Zardari 'pocketed millions' in French subs deal: report"] ''Nation'', 15 January 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

About the case study and trial of the Haq, former [[Chief of Naval Staff (Pakistan)|chief of naval staff]], [[Admiral|Adm.]] [[Abdul Aziz Mirza]] reportedly quoted in the [[Pakistani media|news media]] that "former Naval Chief Mansurul haq was not convicted of Agosta kickbacks but for the bribes he had pocketed in other defence deals."{{rp|contents}}&lt;ref name="Grosvenor House Publishing, Sehri"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sehri|first1=Inam|title=Judges and Generals in Pakistan|date=2013|publisher=Grosvenor House Publishing|isbn=9781781482346|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ZgRnAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT411&amp;dq=mansurul+haq+aziz+mirza#v=onepage&amp;q=mansurul%20haq%20aziz%20mirza&amp;f=false|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3734">[[File:Margherita Bevignani.jpg|right]]'''Margherita Bevignani''' (1887, (?) – March 1921, [[Milan]]) was an Italian operatic [[soprano]], best known for being the first singer to record the entire role of Violetta in [[Giuseppe Verdi]]'s opera ''[[La traviata]]'' in 1915. 

==Biography==
Information is lacking concerning Bevignani's place of birth and her early years. She was apparently born in 1887 and studied singing with a certain teacher Perilli. She made her debut in 1909 at Politeama Garibaldi in [[Treviso]] as Micaela in Bizet's ''[[Carmen (opera)|Carmen]]''. Subsequently, she was invited to many Italian provincial stages, such as the [[Teatro Petruzzelli]] in [[Bari]] and the [[Teatro Massimo Bellini]] in [[Catania]]. In 1910 she made several guest appearances in a number of opera houses of [[Latin America]], including the [[Theatro Municipal (Rio de Janeiro)|Theatro Municipal]] in [[Rio de Janeiro]],&lt;ref&gt;"Echoes of Music Abroad," ''Musical America'' (May 21, 1910), p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; where she sang Musetta in Puccini's ''[[La bohème]]'' and Gilda in ''[[Rigoletto]]''. In 1911 she performed the role of Marguerite de Valois in [[Giacomo Meyerbeer]]'s ''[[Les Huguenots]]'' at the [[Teatro Donizetti]] in [[Bergamo]] under the direction of [[Gino Marinuzzi]].&lt;ref name=kr&gt;"Bevignani, Margherita," ''Grosses Sängerlexikon'', Vierte, erweiterte und aktualisierte Auflage, (München: K.G. Sauer, 2003), Band 1, p. 398.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1912 Bevignani arrived in [[Milan]], where she sang Amina in Bellini's ''[[La sonnambula]]'' at the [[Teatro dal Verme]], though never appeared at [[La Scala]]. In the same year she toured [[London]], where, despite never managing to sing at [[The Royal Opera House]], she performed Nedda in Leoncavallo's ''[[Pagliacci]]'' at the [[Coliseum Theatre]].&lt;ref name = "Voce"&gt;La Voce Antica. [http://www.lavoceantica.it/Soprano/Bevignani%20Margherita.htm"]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1914-1916 Bevignani was invited to the [[Netherlands]], where she was particularly praised for her Violetta in ''[[La traviata]]'' as well as Norina in [[Gaetano Donizetti]]'s ''[[Don Pasquale]]''.&lt;ref name=kr/&gt; Italy's entrance into the [[First World War]] forced the singer's stay in the Netherlands, where she gave successful performances as Violetta, Gilda, Rosina in Rossini's ''[[Il barbiere di Siviglia]]'' and Lucia di Lammermoor in Donizetti's [[Lucia di Lammermoor|opera]] of the same title. After returning to Italy in 1918, Bevignani was struck by a fierce attack of [[pulmonary tuberculosis]] which put an end to her career. Her last performance was ''La traviata'' at the [[Royal Theatre Carré]] in [[Amsterdam]] where she sang Violetta. Margherita Bevignani died in [[Milan]] in March 1921, being only 34 years old.

==Discography==
Even though Margherita Bevignani did not achieve any worldwide recognition and virtually never managed to sing at any of the world's principal opera houses, the name of this singer is significant. She sang Violetta in the first complete Italian recording of ''[[La traviata]]'' in 1915 with Franco Tumminello and [[Ernesto Badini]] as partners, made by [[HMV]] in [[Milan]] with the forces of [[La Scala]] under the direction of [[Carlo Sabajno]]. It shows Bevignani as a  [[coloratura soprano]]. In addition, Bevignani can be heard on a number of separate recordings made for the Favorite company, including extended excerpts from Gounod's ''[[Faust (opera)|Faust]]'', arias and duets by [[Verdi]], [[Vincenzo Bellini|Bellini]], [[Donizetti]], [[Rossini]], [[Wagner]] and [[Massenet]].

'''Mary Dyer''' (born '''Marie Barrett'''; c. 1611&amp;nbsp;– 1 June 1660) was an [[English people|English]] and colonial American [[Puritan]] turned [[Religious Society of Friends|Quaker]] who was [[hanging|hanged]] in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]], for repeatedly defying a Puritan law banning Quakers from the colony.  She is one of the four executed [[Quakers]] known as the [[Boston martyrs]].

While the place of her birth is not known, she was married in [[London]] in 1633 to the [[milliner]] [[William Dyer (settler)|William Dyer]].  Mary and William were Puritans who were interested in reforming the [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] Church from within, without separating from it.  As [[Charles I of England|the English king]] increased pressure on the Puritans, they left [[England]] by the thousands to go to [[New England]] in the early 1630s. Mary and William arrived in Boston by 1635, joining the Boston Church in December of that year.  Like most members of Boston's church, they soon became involved in the [[Antinomian Controversy]], a theological crisis lasting from 1636 to 1638.  Mary and William were strong advocates of  [[Anne Hutchinson]] and [[John Wheelwright]] in the controversy, and as a result, Mary's husband was disenfranchised and disarmed for supporting these "heretics" and also for harboring his own heretical views.  Subsequently, they left Massachusetts with many others to establish a new colony on [[Aquidneck Island]] (later Rhode Island) in [[Narraganset Bay]].

Before leaving Boston, Mary had given birth to a severely deformed infant that was stillborn. Because of the theological implications of such a birth, the baby was buried secretly.  When the [[Massachusetts]] authorities learned of this birth, the ordeal became public, and in the minds of the colony's ministers and magistrates, the [[monstrous birth]] was clearly a result of Mary's "monstrous" religious opinions.  More than a decade later, in late 1651, Mary Dyer boarded a ship for England, and stayed there for over five years, becoming an avid follower of the Quaker religion that had been established by [[George Fox]] several years earlier.  Because Quakers were considered among the most heinous of heretics by the Puritans, [[Massachusetts]] enacted several laws against them.  When Dyer returned to Boston from England, she was immediately imprisoned and then banished.  Defying her order of banishment, she was again banished, this time upon pain of death.  Deciding that she would die as a martyr if the anti-Quaker laws were not repealed, Dyer once again returned to Boston and was sent to the gallows in 1659, having the rope around her neck when a reprieve was announced.  Not accepting the reprieve, she again returned to Boston the following year and was then hanged to become the third of four Quaker martyrs.

== Early life ==
Details of the life of Mary Dyer in England are scarce; only her marriage record and a short probate record for her brother have been found.  In both of these English records, her name is given as Marie Barret.  A tradition that Dyer was the daughter of [[Lady Arbella Stuart]] and [[William Seymour, 2nd Duke of Somerset|Sir William Seymour]], was debunked by genealogist [[George Andrews Moriarty, Jr|G. Andrews Moriarty]] in 1950.  However, Moriarty correctly predicted that despite his work the legend would persist, and in 1994 the tradition was included as being plausible in a published biography of Dyer.{{sfn|Winsser|2004|pp=27-28}}{{sfn|Plimpton|1994|pp=12-13}}

While the parents of Mary Dyer have not been identified, Johan Winsser made a significant discovery concerning a brother of Dyer, which he published in 2004.  On 18 January 1633/4, a probate administration was recorded in the Prerogative Court of [[Canterbury]] for a William Barret.  The instrument granted administration of Barret's estate "jointly to William Dyer of [[St Martin-in-the-Fields]], fishmonger, and his wife Marie Dyer, otherwise Barret."{{sfn|Winsser|2004|pp=27-28}}  The fact that the estate of a brother of Mary Dyer would be left in the hands of Mary and her husband strongly suggests that William (and therefore Mary) had no living parents and no living brothers at the time, and also suggests that Mary was either William Barrett's only living sister, or his oldest living sister.  The other facts that could be drawn from the instrument are that William Barrett was unmarried and that he died somewhere "beyond the seas" from England.{{sfn|Winsser|2004|pp=27-28}}

[[Image:Stmartins 1562.jpg|thumb|right|Map showing [[St Martin-in-the-Fields]], circa 1562, where Mary and [[William Dyer (settler)|William Dyer]] were married in 1633]]

That Mary was well educated is apparent from letters that she wrote.{{sfn|Rogers|1896|p=31}}  Quaker chronicler George Bishop described her as a "Comely Grave Woman, and of a goodly Personage, and one of a good Report, having a husband of an Estate, fearing the Lord, and a Mother of Children."{{sfn|Rogers|1896|p=30}} The Dutch writer [[Gerard Croese]] wrote that she was reputed to be a "person of no mean extract and parentage, of an estate pretty plentiful, of a comely stature and countenance, of a piercing knowledge in many things, of a wonderful sweet and pleasant discourse, so fit for great affairs..."{{sfn|Rogers|1896|p=31}}  Massachusetts Governor [[John Winthrop]] described her as being "a very proper and fair woman...of a very proud spirit, and much addicted to revelations".{{sfn|Rogers|1896|p=30}}

Mary was married to [[William Dyer (settler)|William Dyer]], a [[fishmonger]] and [[milliner]], on 27 October 1633 at the parish of St Martin-in-the-Fields, which at the time was in Westminster, Middlesex, but is now a part of [[London]].{{sfn|Anderson|Sanborn|Sanborn|2001|p=381}}  Mary's husband was baptized in Lincolnshire, England.{{Sfn|Anderson|Sanborn|Sanborn|2001|p=381}}  Settlers from Lincolnshire contributed a disproportionately large percentage of members of the Boston Church in New England, and a disproportionately large part of the leadership during the founding of Rhode Island.{{sfn|Battis|1962|pp=300-307}}

Mary and William Dyer were Puritans, as evidenced by their acceptance into the membership of the Boston church in New England.  The Puritans wanted to complete the separation of the Anglican church from Catholicism that had begun under the rule of the English monarch [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]].  The conformists in England accepted the English monarch as the head of the church, and the form of worship that greatly resembled that in the Catholic church.{{sfn|Arnold|1859|pp=1-6}}  The Puritans, as non-conformists, wanted to do away with the vestments, bowing and making the sign of the cross that were prevalent in Anglican worship, and observe a much simpler and Biblical form of worship.  Some of the non-conformists, such as the Pilgrims, wanted to separate completely from the Anglican church, while the Puritans wished to reform the church from within. As the ranks of Puritans began swelling in England, so too did the severity of government intervention, including exile or death for ministers not adhering to the state religious practices.{{sfn|Arnold|1859|pp=1-6}} In the 1620s England's [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]], with little understanding of religion, was adamant that English subjects conform to the same uniform religion, which included the vestments and procedures found in the Catholic church.  As exploration of the North American continent was then leading to settlement, the Puritans found a way to practice their form of religion by emigrating from England.{{sfn|Bremer|1995|pp=29-32}}

== Massachusetts ==
In 1635, Mary and William Dyer sailed from England to [[New England]].  Mary was likely pregnant or gave birth during the voyage because on 20 December 1635 their son Samuel was baptized at the Boston church, exactly one week after the Dyers joined the church.{{sfn|Anderson|Sanborn|Sanborn|2001|p=381}}{{Sfn|Austin|1887|p=290}} William Dyer became a [[Freeman (Colonial)|freeman]] of Boston on 3 March the following year.{{Sfn|Anderson|Sanborn|Sanborn|2001|p=379}}

=== Antinomian Controversy ===
{{main article|Antinomian Controversy}}

During the earliest days of the Boston Church, before the arrival of Mary and William Dyer, there was a single minister, the Reverend [[John Wilson (minister)|John Wilson]].  In 1633, one of England's most noted Puritan clergymen, [[John Cotton (Puritan)|John Cotton]], arrived in Boston, and quickly became the second minister (called "teacher") in Boston's church.   In time, the Boston parishioners could sense a theological difference between Wilson and Cotton.{{sfn|Winship|2002|pp=6-7}}  [[Anne Hutchinson]], a theologically astute [[midwife]] who had the ear of many of the colony's women, became outspoken in support of Cotton, and condemned the theology of Wilson and most of the other ministers in the colony during gatherings, or [[conventicle]]s, held at her house.{{sfn|Hall|1990|p=5}}{{sfn|Bremer|1981|p=4}}

[[File:Anne Hutchinson on Trial.jpg|thumb|left|[[Anne Hutchinson]], who was tried for slandering the ministers, was a friend and mentor of the much younger Mary Dyer]]

Differing religious opinions within the colony eventually became public debates and erupted into what has traditionally been called the [[Antinomian Controversy]].{{sfn|Winship|2002|pp=6–7}}  Many members of Boston's church found Wilson's emphasis on morality, and his doctrine of "evidencing justification by sanctification" (a [[Covenant theology#Covenant of works|covenant of works]]) to be disagreeable. Hutchinson told her followers that Wilson lacked "the seal of the Spirit."{{sfn|Battis|1962|p=105}}  Wilson's theological views conformed with those of all of the other ministers in the colony except for Cotton, who instead stressed "the inevitability of God's will" (a [[Covenant theology#Covenant of grace|covenant of grace]]).{{sfn|Bremer|1995|p=66}}  The Boston parishioners had become accustomed to Cotton's doctrines, and some of them began disrupting Wilson's sermons, even finding excuses to leave when Wilson got up to preach or pray.{{sfn|Bremer|1981|p=5}}

Both William and Mary Dyer sided strongly with Hutchinson and the free-grace advocates, and it is highly likely that Mary attended the periodic theological gatherings at the Hutchinson's home.{{sfn|Battis|1962|pp=300-307}}  In May 1636, the Bostonians received a new ally when the Reverend [[John Wheelwright]] arrived from England, and immediately aligned himself with Cotton, Hutchinson and the other free-grace supporters.{{sfn|Winship|2002|pp=83-89}}  Yet another boost for those advocating the free-grace theology came during the same month, when the young aristocrat [[Henry Vane the Younger|Henry Vane]] was elected as the governor of the colony.  Vane was a strong supporter of Hutchinson, but also had his own unorthodox ideas about theology that were considered radical.{{sfn|Winship|2002|pp=6–7}}

By late 1636, the theological schism had become great enough that the General Court called for a day of fasting to help ease the colony's difficulties.  The appointed fasting day, in January, included church services, and Cotton preached during the morning, but with Wilson away in England,  John Wheelwright was invited to preach during the afternoon.{{sfn|Hall|1990|p=7}} Though his sermon may have seemed benign to the average listener in the congregation, most of the colony's ministers found Wheelwright's words to be objectionable.  Instead of bringing peace, the sermon fanned the flames of controversy, and in Winthrop's words, Wheelwright "inveighed against all that walked in a covenant of works, ... and called them antichrists, and stirred up the people against them with much bitterness and vehemency."{{sfn|Hall|1990|p=7}}  In contrast, the followers of Hutchinson were encouraged by the sermon, and intensified their crusade against the "legalists" among the clergy.  During church services and lectures, they publicly questioned the ministers about their doctrines which disagreed with their own beliefs.{{sfn|Hall|1990|p=7}}

[[File:Wheelwright.John.AmAntiquarianSoc.jpg|thumb|By signing the petition in support of the Reverend [[John Wheelwright]] (shown here), William Dyer was disarmed.]]

When the General Court next met on 9 March, Wheelwright was called upon to answer for his sermon.{{sfn|Hall|1990|p=8}}  He was judged guilty of "contempt &amp; sedition" for having "purposely set himself to kindle and increase" bitterness within the colony.{{sfn|Hall|1990|p=8}}  The vote did not pass without a fight, however, and Wheelwright's friends protested formally.  Most members of the Boston church, favoring Wheelwright in the conflict, drafted a petition justifying Wheelwright's sermon, and 60 people signed this remonstrance protesting the conviction.{{sfn|Hall|1990|p=153}}  William Dyer was among those who signed the petition which accused the General Court of condemning the truth of Christ.  Dyer's signature in support of Wheelwright soon proved to be fateful to the Dyer family.{{sfn|Rogers|1896|p=32}}

Anne Hutchinson faced trial in early November 1637 for "traducing" (slandering) the ministers, and was sentenced to banishment on her second day in court.  Within a week of her sentencing, many supporters of hers, including William Dyer, were called into court and were disenfranchised.{{sfn|Rogers|1896|p=32}}  Fearing an armed insurrection, the constables were then sent from door to door throughout the colony's towns to disarm those who signed the Wheelwright petition.{{sfn|Battis|1962|p=211}}  Within ten days these individuals were ordered to deliver "all such guns, pistols, swords, powder, shot, &amp; match as they shall be owners of, or have in their custody, upon paine of ten pound[s] for every default".{{sfn|Battis|1962|p=211}}  A great number of those who signed the petition, faced with losing their protection and in some cases livelihood, recanted under the pressure, and "acknowledged their error" in signing the petition.  Those who refused to recant suffered hardships and many decided to leave the colony.{{sfn|Battis|1962|p=212}}  Being both disenfranchised and disarmed, William Dyer was among those who could no longer justify remaining in Massachusetts.{{sfn|Rogers|1896|p=33}}

=== Monstrous birth ===
While William Dyer appeared in the Boston records on several occasions, Mary Dyer had not caught the attention of the Massachusetts authorities until March 1638 as the Antinomian Controversy came to an end. Following Hutchinson's civil trial, she was kept as a prisoner in the home of a brother of one of the colony's ministers. Though she had been banished from the colony, this did not mean she was removed as a member of the Boston church. In March 1638 she was forced to face a church trial to get at the root of her heresies, and determine if her relationship with the Puritan church would continue. While William Dyer was likely with other men finding a new home away from Massachusetts, Mary Dyer was still in Boston and in attendance at this church trial. At the conclusion of the trial, Hutchinson was excommunicated, and as she was leaving the Boston Church, Mary stood and walked hand in hand with her out of the building.{{sfn|LaPlante|2004|p=207}} As the two women were leaving the church, a member of the congregation asked another person about the identity of the woman leaving the church with Hutchinson. A reply was made that it was the woman who had had the monstrous birth. [[John Winthrop|Governor Winthrop]] soon became aware of this verbal exchange and began conducting an investigation.{{sfn|Rogers|1896|p=32}}

Dyer had given birth five months earlier, on 11 October 1637, to a deformed [[stillbirth|stillborn]] baby. Winthrop wrote that while many women had gathered for the occasion, that "none were left at the time of the birth but the midwife and two others, whereof one fell asleep."{{sfn|LaPlante|2004|p=206}} Actually, two women present were midwives—Anne Hutchinson and Jane Hawkins, but the third woman was never identified. Hutchinson fully understood the serious theological implications of such a birth, and immediately sought the counsel of the Reverend John Cotton. Thinking about how he would react if this were his child, Cotton instructed Hutchinson to conceal the circumstances of the birth. The infant was then buried secretly.{{sfn|Winsser|1990|p=23}}

Once Winthrop had learned of the monstrous birth, he confronted Jane Hawkins, and armed with new information then confronted Cotton. As the news spread among the colony's leaders, it was determined that the infant would be exhumed and examined. According to Winthrop, a group of "above a hundred persons" including Winthrop, Cotton, Wilson, and the Reverend [[Thomas Weld (minister)|Thomas Weld]] "went to the place of buryall &amp; commanded to digg it up to [behold] it, &amp; they sawe it, a most hideous creature, a woman, a fish, a bird, &amp; a beast all woven together..."{{sfn|LaPlante|2004|p=206}}{{sfn|Winsser|1990|p=24}} In his journal, Winthrop provided a more complete description as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;it was of ordinary bigness; it had a face, but no head, and the ears stood upon the shoulders and were like an ape's; it had no forehead, but over the eyes four horns, hard and sharp; two of them were above one inch long, the other two shorter; the eyes standing out, and the mouth also; the nose hooked upward; all over the breast and back full of sharp pricks and scales, like a thornback [i.e., a skate or ray], the navel and all the belly, with the distinction of the sex, were where the back should be, and the back and hips before, where the belly should have been; behind, between the shoulders, it had two mouths, and in each of them a piece of red flesh sticking out; it had arms and legs as other children; but, instead of toes, it had on each foot three claws, like a young fowl, with sharp talons.{{sfn|Winthrop|1996|p=254}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:JohnWinthropColorPortrait.jpg|thumb|left|When Governor [[John Winthrop]] learned of Dyer's monstrous birth, he had the infant exhumed and examined, then wrote a highly embellished report.|alt=A painting of a man with a stern expression on his face, wearing very dark clothing so that his pale hands show boldly. His hands are placed in front of him, separately, one above the other.]]

While some of the description may have been accurate, many puritanical embellishments were added to better fit the moral story being portrayed by the authorities. The modern medical condition that best fits the description of the infant is [[anencephaly]], meaning partial or complete absence of a brain.{{sfn|LaPlante|2004|p=206}} This episode was just the beginning of the attention emanating from Dyer's personal tragedy. The religion of the Puritans demanded a close look at all aspects of one's life for signs of God's approval or disapproval. Even becoming a member of the Puritan church in New England required a public confession of faith, and any behavior that was viewed by the clergy as being unorthodox required a theological examination by the church, followed by a public confession and repentance by the offender.{{sfn|Winsser|1990|pp=20-21}} Such microscopic inspection caused even private matters to become looked at publicly for the purpose of instruction, and Dyer's tragedy was widely examined for signs of God's judgment. This led to a highly subjective form of justice, an example of which was the 1656 hanging of [[Ann Hibbins]] whose offense was simply being resented by her neighbor. In Winthrop's eyes, Dyer's case was unequivocal, and he was convinced that her monstrous birth was a clear signal of God's displeasure with the antinomian heretics. Winthrop felt that it was quite providential that the discovery of the monstrous birth occurred exactly when Anne Hutchinson was excommunicated from the local body of believers, and exactly one week before Dyer's husband was questioned in the Boston church for his heretic opinions.{{sfn|Winsser|1990|pp=22-25}}

To further fuel Winthrop's beliefs, Anne Hutchinson suffered from a miscarriage later in the same year when she aborted a strange mass of tissue that appeared like a handful of transparent grapes (a rare condition, mostly in woman over 45, called a [[hydatidiform mole]]).{{sfn|LaPlante|2004|p=217}} Winthrop was convinced of divine influence in these events, and made sure that every leader in New England received his own account of the "monster" birth, and he even sent a deposition to England. Soon, the story took on a life of its own, and in 1642 it was printed in London under the title ''Newes from New-England of a Most Strange and Prodigious Birth, brought to Boston in New-England...'' Though the author of this work was not named, it may have been the New England minister Thomas Weld who was in England at the time to support New England's ecclesiastical independence. In 1644 Weld, who was still in England, took Winthrop's account of the Antinomian Controversy, and published it under one title, and then added a preface of his own and republished it under the title ''A Short story of the Rise, reign and ruine of the Antinomians, Familists &amp; Libertines...'' usually just called ''Short Story''.{{sfn|Winsser|1990|pp=25-27}} In 1648 [[Samuel Rutherford]], a Scottish Presbyterian, included Winthrop's account of the monster in his anti-sectarian treatise ''A Survey of the Spirituall Antichrist, Opening the Secrets of Familisme and Antinomianisme''. Even the English writer, Samuel Danforth, included the birth in his 1648 ''Almanack'' as a "memorable occurrence" from 1637. {{sfn|Winsser|1990|pp=27-28}} The only minister who wrote without sensationalism about Dyer's deformed infant was the Reverend [[John Wheelwright]], Anne Hutchinson's ally during the Antinomian Controversy. In his 1645 response to Winthrop's ''Short Story'', entitled ''Mercurius Americanus'', he wrote that Dyer's and Hutchinson's monsters described by Winthrop were nothing but "a monstrous conception of his [Winthrop's] brain, a spurious issue of his intellect."{{sfn|LaPlante|2004|p=219}}

Twenty years after the tragic birth, when Mary Dyer returned to the public spotlight for her Quaker evangelism, she continued to be remembered for the birth of her deformed child, this time in the diary of John Hull. Also, in 1660, an exchange of letters took place between England and New England when the two eminent English clergymen, Richard Baxter and Thomas Brooks, sought information about the monstrous birth from 1637. A New Englander, whose identity was not included, sent back information about the event to the English divines. The New Englander, who used Winthrop's original description of the "monster" almost verbatim, has subsequently been identified as yet another well-known clergyman, [[John Eliot (missionary)|John Eliot]] who preached at the church in Roxbury, not far from Boston. {{sfn|Winsser|1990|p=29}}

The most outrageous accounting of Dyer's infant occurred in 1667 when a memorandum of the Englishman Sir Joseph Williamson quoted a Major Scott about the event. Scott was a country lawyer with a notorious reputation, and his detractors included the famous diarist [[Samuel Pepys]].{{sfn|Winsser|1990|pp=32-33}} Scott's outlandish assertion was that the young Massachusetts governor, Henry Vane, fathered the monstrous births of both Mary Dyer and Anne Hutchinson; that he "debauched both, and both were delivered of monsters."{{sfn|LaPlante|2004|p=219}} After this, the accounts became less frequent, and the last historical account of Dyer's monstrous birth was in 1702 when the New England minister [[Cotton Mather]] mentioned it in passing in his ''Magnalia Christi Americana.''{{sfn|Winsser|1990|pp=32-33}}

== Rhode Island ==
Several of those affected by the events of the Antinomian Controversy went north with John Wheelwright in November 1637 to found the town of [[Exeter, New Hampshire|Exeter]] in what would become New Hampshire.  A larger group, uncertain where to go, contacted [[Roger Williams (theologian)|Roger Williams]], who suggested they purchase land from the natives along the [[Narraganset Bay]], near his settlement in [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]].  On 7 March 1638, just as Anne Hutchinson's church trial was getting underway, a group of men gathered at the home of [[William Coddington]] and drafted a [[Portsmouth Compact|compact]] for a new government.  This group included several of the strongest supporters of Hutchinson who had either been disenfranchised, disarmed, excommunicated, or banished, including William Dyer.{{sfn|Battis|1962|p=231}}  Altogether, [[List of early settlers of Rhode Island#Founders of Portsmouth|23 individuals]] signed the instrument which was intended to form a "Bodie Politick" based on Christian principles, and Coddington was chosen as the leader of the group.  Following through with Roger Williams' proposed land purchase, these exiles established their colony on [[Aquidneck Island]] (later named Rhode Island), naming the settlement Pocasset.{{sfn|Bicknell|1920|p=975}}

[[File:Portsmouth Compact document.jpg|thumb|right|Portsmouth Compact; William Dyer's name is 11th on the list]]

William and Mary Dyer joined [[William Hutchinson (Rhode Island)|William]] and Anne Hutchinson and many others in building the new settlement on Aquidneck Island.  Within a year of the founding of this settlement, however, there was dissension among the leaders, and the Dyers joined Coddington, with [[List of early settlers of Rhode Island#Founders of Newport|several other inhabitants]], in moving to the south end of the island, establishing the town of [[Newport, Rhode Island|Newport]].  The Hutchinsons remained in Pocasset, whose inhabitants renamed the town [[Portsmouth, Rhode Island|Portsmouth]], and William Hutchinson became its chief magistrate.  William Dyer immediately became the recording secretary of Newport,{{sfn|Bicknell|1920|p=976}} and he and three others were tasked in June 1639 to proportion the new lands.{{Sfn|Austin|1887|p=290}}  In 1640 the two towns of Portsmouth and Newport united, and Coddington was elected governor, while Dyer was chosen as Secretary, and held this position from 1640 to 1647.{{sfn|Bicknell|1920|p=976}}   Roger Williams, who envisioned a union of all four settlements on the Narragansett Bay (Providence, Warwick, Portsmouth, and Newport), wanted royal recognition of these settlements for their protection, and went to England where he obtained a patent bringing the four towns under one government.  Coddington was opposed to the Williams patent and managed to resist union with Providence and Warwick until 1647 when representatives of the four towns ultimately met and united under the patent.{{Sfn|Bicknell|1920|p=980}}  With all four of the Narragansett settlements now under one government, William Dyer was elected the General Recorder for the entire colony in 1648.{{Sfn|Austin|1887|p=290}}

Coddington continued to be unhappy with the consolidated government, and wanted colonial independence for the two island towns.  He sailed to England to present his case, and in April 1651, the Council of State of England gave him the commission he sought, making him governor-for-life of the island.{{Sfn|Bicknell|1920|p=983}}  Criticism of Coddington arose as soon as he returned with his commission.  Three men were then directed to go to England to get Coddington's commission revoked:  Roger Williams, representing the mainland towns, and [[John Clarke (Baptist minister)|John Clarke]] and William Dyer representing the two island towns. In November 1651 the three men left for England, where Dyer would meet his wife.{{Sfn|Bicknell|1920|p=987}}  Mary Dyer had sailed to England before the three men departed, as Coddington wrote in a letter to Winthrop that Mr. Dyer "sent his wife over in the first ship with Mr. Travice, and is now gone himself for England."{{Sfn|Anderson|Sanborn|Sanborn|2001|p=384}}  It remains a mystery as to why Mary Dyer would leave six children behind, one an infant, to travel abroad.  Biographer Ruth Plimpton hinted that Mary had some royal connection, and suggested that the news of the execution of [[Charles I of England|King Charles]] compelled her to go.  However, no record has been found to satisfactorily explain this mystery.{{sfn|Plimpton|1994|p=110}}

Because of recent hostilities between the English and the Dutch, the three men, once in England, did not meet with the Council of State on New England until April 1652.  After the men explained their case, Coddington's commission for the island government was revoked in October 1652.{{Sfn|Bicknell|1920|p=987}}  William Dyer was the messenger who returned to Rhode Island the following February, bringing the news of the return of the colony to the Williams Patent of 1643.  Mary, however, would remain in England for the next four years.{{sfn|Plimpton|1994|p=137}}

== Quaker conversion ==
=== England ===

[[File:Fox by Lely 2.jpg|thumb|right|[[George Fox]] founded the Quaker religion in about 1647]]

Mary Dyer's time in England lasted for over five years, and during her stay she had become deeply taken by the Quaker religion established by [[George Fox]] around 1647.  Formally known as the [[Society of Friends]], the Quakers did not believe in baptism, formal prayer and the Lord's Supper, nor did they believe in an ordained ministry.  Each member was a minister in his or her own right, women were essentially treated as men in matters of spirituality, and they relied on an "Inner Light of Christ" as their source of spiritual inspiration.{{sfn|Rogers|1896|p=22}}  In addition to denouncing the clergy, and refusing to support it with their tithes, they also claimed liberty of conscience as an inalienable right and demanded the separation of church and state.  Their worship consisted of silent meditation, though those moved by the Spirit would at times make public exhortations.  They minimized the customs of bowing or men removing their hats, they would not take an oath, and they would not fight in wars.  The Puritans in Massachusetts viewed Quakers as being among the most reprehensible of heretics, and they enacted several laws against them.{{sfn|Rogers|1896|pp=24-26}}

While in England, one place that Dyer visited, and likely spent a lot of time, was [[Swarthmoor Hall]], located near [[Ulverston]] in [[Cumbria]] in northwestern England.  Biographer Ruth Plimpton surmises that Dyer had spent time with her old friend Henry Vane at his estate in [[Lincolnshire]], called Belleau, and that Vane had introduced Mary to the judge Thomas Fell who traveled extensively across the kingdom, and who owned the Swarthmoor manor.  In 1652 George Fox had visited Swarthmoor while the judge was traveling, but was invited in as a house guest by the judge's wife, [[Margaret Fell]].  Within a few days, Fox had swayed Margaret to his religious beliefs.  When the judge returned to Swarthmoor, he too listened to Fox, and though he was not taken by Fox's religious views, he was nevertheless tolerant and sympathetic with Fox, and allowed him to use Swarthmoor as a Quaker meeting place.{{sfn|Plimpton|1994|pp=123-125}}

Plimpton relates that Dyer made the journey of several days from Lincolnshire to Cumbria, and stayed at Swarthmoor as a guest of the Fells.  It is here that Dyer almost certainly met George Fox, and learned about his beliefs and the role of women as preachers in his faith.{{sfn|Plimpton|1994|p=129}}  Though documentary evidence of an actual meeting of Dyer and Fox is lacking, it is certain that Dyer was known to Margaret Fell, based on a letter written to Margaret by two Quakers in [[Barbadoes]].  The two men, John Rous and Henry Fell (no close relation to Thomas and Margaret Fell)  wrote on 24 May 1657 that "We are still waiting here to get a passage for New England.  We have not heard anything yet from Anne Burden and Mary Dyer, who went thither..."{{sfn|Webb|1884|pp=184-185}}

Judge Thomas Fell died in 1658, but Swarthmoor continued to be a center of Quaker activity where George Fox would visit on many occasions.  Margaret Fell was imprisoned for her Quaker activism from 1664 to 1668, and following her release she married George Fox.{{sfn|Plimpton|1994|p=131}}

=== Quakers in Massachusetts ===
Of all the New England colonies, Massachusetts was the most active in persecuting the Quakers, but the Plymouth, Connecticut and New Haven colonies also shared in their persecution.  When the first Quakers arrived in Boston in 1656 there were no laws yet enacted against them, but this quickly changed, and punishments were meted out with or without the law.  It was primarily the ministers and the magistrates who opposed the Quakers and their evangelistic efforts.{{sfn|Rogers|1896|pp=26-27}}  A particularly vehement persecutor, the Reverend [[John Norton (divine)|John Norton]] of the Boston church, clamored for the law of banishment upon pain of death.  He is the one who later wrote the vindication to England, justifying the execution of the first two Quakers in 1659.{{sfn|Rogers|1896|pp=2-3}}

The punishments doled out to the Quakers intensified as their perceived threat to the Puritan religious order increased.  These included the stocks and pillory, lashes with a three-corded, knotted whip, fines, imprisonment, mutilation (having ears cut off), banishment and death.  When whipped, women were stripped to the waist, thus being publicly exposed, and whipped until bleeding.  Such was the fate of Dyer's Newport neighbor, [[Herodias Gardiner]] who had made a perilous journey through a 60-mile wilderness to get to [[Weymouth, Massachusetts|Weymouth]] in the Massachusetts colony.  She had made the arduous trek with another woman and with her "Babe sucking at her Breast" to give her Quaker testimony to friends in Weymouth.  Similarly, [[Katherine Marbury Scott]], the wife of [[Richard Scott (settler)|Richard Scott]], and a younger sister of [[Anne Hutchinson]], had received ten lashes for petitioning for the release of future son-in-law, [[Christopher Holder]], who was imprisoned. This was the setting into which Mary Dyer stepped, upon her return from England.{{sfn|Rogers|1896|pp=4-11}}

=== Dyer's return to New England ===
In early 1657 Dyer returned to New England with the widow Ann Burden, who came to Boston to settle the estate of her late husband.{{sfn|Plimpton|1994|p=137}}{{sfn|Rogers|1896|p=35}} Dyer was immediately recognized as a Quaker and imprisoned.   Dyer's husband had to come to Boston to get her out of jail, and he was bound and sworn not to allow her to lodge in any Massachusetts town, or to speak to any person while traversing the colony to return home.  Dyer nevertheless continued to travel in [[New England]] to preach her Quaker message, and in early 1658 was arrested in the [[New Haven Colony]], and then expelled for preaching her "inner light" belief, and the notion that women and men stood on equal ground in church worship and organization.{{sfn|Rogers|1896|p=36}}  In addition to sharing her Quaker message, she had come to New Haven with two others to visit Humphrey Norton who had been imprisoned for three weeks.  Anti-Quaker laws had been enacted there, and after Dyer was arrested, she was "set on a horse", and forced to leave.{{sfn|Plimpton|1994|pp=143-144}}

Following her New Haven trip, Mary was recovering from a bout of pneumonia when in June 1658 two Quaker activists, [[Christopher Holder]] and John Copeland came to Boston.  They had already been evicted from other parts of the colony, and were exasperating the magistrates.  Being joined by John Rous from Barbadoes, the three men were sentenced to having their right ears cut off, and the sentence was carried out in July.{{sfn|Plimpton|1994|pp=147-148}}  As biographer Plimpton wrote, the men "were so stalwart while their ears were removed" that additional punishment in the form of whippings were carried out for the next nine weeks.{{sfn|Plimpton|1994|p=149}}  Word of this cruelty reached Dyer while she was visiting [[Richard Scott (settler)|Richard and Katherine Scott]] in Providence.  Richard and Katherine Scott were considered to be the first Quakers in Providence.  The Scotts had two daughters, Mary, the older, who was engaged to Christopher Holder, and Patience, the younger, aged 11.  Mrs. Scott and her two daughters, along with Mary Dyer and her friend Hope Clifton, were all compelled to go to Boston to visit with Holder and the other men in jail. The four women and child were all imprisoned. Three other people who had also come to visit Holder and were then imprisoned were Nicholas Davis from Plymouth, the London merchant [[William Robinson (martyr)|William Robinson]] and a Yorkshire farmer named [[Marmaduke Stephenson]], the latter two on a Quaker mission from England.{{sfn|Plimpton|1994|p=149}}{{sfn|Rogers|1896|p=37}}

[[File:JohnEndecottPortrait.jpg|thumb|left|Governor [[John Endecott]] sent the Quaker martyrs to the gallows.]]

The Quaker situation was becoming highly problematical for the magistrates.  Their response to the increasing presence of these people was to enact tougher laws, and on 19 October 1658, a new law was passed in the Massachusetts colony that introduced capital punishment.  Quakers would be banished from the colony upon pain of death, meaning they would be hanged if they defied the law.  Dyer, Davis, Robinson, and Stephenson were then brought to court, and then sentenced to "banishment upon pain of death" under the new law.{{sfn|Plimpton|1994|p=151}}  Davis returned to Plymouth, Dyer went home to Newport, but Robinson and Stephenson remained in the Massachusetts Bay Colony, spending time in Salem.{{sfn|Plimpton|1994|p=152}}

In June 1659 Robinson and Stephenson were once again apprehended and brought back to the Boston jail.{{sfn|Rogers|1896|p=37}}  When Dyer heard of these arrests, she once again left her home in Newport, and returned to Boston to support her Quaker brethren, ignoring her order of banishment, and once again being incarcerated.  Her husband had already come to Boston two years earlier to retrieve her from the authorities, signing an oath that she wouldn't return.  He wouldn't come back to Boston again, but on 30 August 1659 he did sit down to write a long and impassioned letter to the magistrates, questioning the legality of the actions taken by the Massachusetts authorities.{{sfn|Plimpton|1994|pp=155-159}}

On 19 October Dyer, Robinson and Stephenson were brought before Governor [[John Endicott|Endicott]], where they explained their mission for the Lord.{{sfn|Rogers|1896|p=40}}   The next day, the same group was brought before the governor, who directed the prison keeper to remove the men's hats.  He then addressed the group, "We have made many laws and endeavored in several ways to keep you from among us, but neither whipping nor imprisonment, nor cutting off ears, nor banishment upon pain of death will keep you from among us.  We desire not your death."  Having met his obligation to present the position of the colony's authorities, he then pronounced, "Hearken now to your sentence of death."{{sfn|Rogers|1896|p=41}}  William Robinson then wanted to read a prepared statement about being called by the Lord to Boston, but the governor would not allow it to be read, and Robinson was sent back to prison.  Marmaduke Stephenson, being less vociferous than Robinson, was allowed to speak, and though initially declining, he ultimately spoke his mind, and then was also sent back to jail.{{sfn|Rogers|1896|pp=41-43}}

When Dyer was brought forth, the governor pronounced her sentence, "Mary Dyer, you shall go from hence to the place from whence you came, and from thence to the place of execution, and there be hanged till you be dead."  She replied, "The will of the Lord be done."  When Endicott directed the marshall to take her away, she said, "Yea, and joyfully I go."{{sfn|Rogers|1896|p=44}}

== First Quaker executions ==
The date set for the executions of the three Quaker evangelists, William Robinson, Marmaduke Stephenson and Mary Dyer, was 27 October 1659.  Captain James Oliver of the Boston military company was directed to provide a force of armed soldiers to escort the prisoners to the place of execution.  Dyer walked hand-in-hand with the two men, and between them.  When she was publicly asked about this inappropriate closeness, she responded instead to her sense of the event:  "It is an hour of the greatest joy I can enjoy in this world.  No eye can see, no ear can hear, no tongue can speak, no heart can understand the sweet incomes and refreshings of the spirit of the Lord which now I enjoy."{{sfn|Rogers|1896|pp=46-48}}  The prisoners attempted to speak to the gathered crowd as they proceeded to the gallows, but their voices were drowned out by constant drum beats.{{sfn|Rogers|1896|p=48}}

[[File:ExecutionAnnHibbins1.jpg|thumb|left|The gallows consisted of a ladder under a tree as in this portrayal of the execution of [[Ann Hibbins]] for witchcraft in 1656.]]

The place of execution was not the [[Boston Common]], as expressed by many writers over the years, but instead about a mile south of there on Boston Neck, near the current intersection of West Dedham Street and Washington Street.  Boston Neck was at one time a narrow spit of land providing the only land access to the Shawmut Peninsula where Boston is located.  Over time, the water on both sides of the isthmus was filled in, so that the narrow neck no longer exists.  A possible reason for the confusion may be because the land immediately south of Boston Neck was not privately owned and considered "common lands", leading some writers to misinterpret this as being the Boston Common.{{sfn|Boston Neck Gallows|2014}}

The gallows consisted of nothing more than a large elm tree.  Here the prisoners would step up a ladder with one end of a rope about their neck and the other end secured to the tree, and the ladder would then be pulled away.  William Robinson was the first of the three to mount the ladder, and when he was positioned he made a statement to the crowd, then died when the ladder was removed.  Marmaduke Stephenson was the next to hang, and then it was Dyer's turn after she witnessed the execution of her two friends.  Dyer's arms and legs were bound and her face was covered with a handkerchief provided by Reverend [[John Wilson (minister)|John Wilson]] who had been one of her pastors in the Boston church many years earlier.{{sfn|Rogers|1896|p=50}}  She stood calmly on the ladder, prepared for her death, but as she waited, an order of a reprieve was announced.  A petition from her son, William, had given the authorities an excuse to avoid her execution.  It had been a pre-arranged scheme, in an attempt to unnerve and dissuade Dyer from her mission.  This was made clear from the wording of the reprieve, though Dyer's only expectation was to die as a martyr.{{sfn|Rogers|1896|pp=50-52}}

The day after Dyer was pulled from the gallows she wrote a letter to the General Court, refusing to accept the provision of the reprieve.  In this letter she wrote, "My life is not accepted, neither availeth me, in comparison with the lives and liberty of the Truth and Servants of the living God for which in the Bowels of Love and Meekness I sought you; yet nevertheless with wicked Hands have you put two of them to Death, which makes me to feel that the Mercies of the Wicked is cruelty; I rather chuse to Dye than to live, as from you, as Guilty of their Innocent Blood."{{sfn|Rogers|1896|p=54}}

The courage of the martyrs led to a popular sentiment against the authorities who now felt it necessary to draft a vindication of their actions.  The wording of this petition suggested that the reprieve of Mary Dyer should soften the reality of the martyrdom of the two men.{{sfn|Rogers|1896|pp=55-56}}  The Massachusetts General Court sent this document to the newly restored [[Charles II of England|king]] in England, and in answer to it, the Quaker historian, [[Edward Burrough]] wrote a short book in 1661.  In this book, Burrough refuted the claims of Massachusetts, point by point, provided a list of the atrocities committed against Quakers, and also provided a narrative of the three Quaker executions that had transpired prior to the book's publication.{{sfn|Burrough|1661|p=i (abstract)}}

After going home to Rhode Island, Dyer spent most of the following winter on [[Shelter Island, New York|Shelter Island]], sitting between the north and south forks of [[Long Island]].  Though sheltered from storms, the island's owner, [[Nathaniel Sylvester]], used it as a refuge for Quakers seeking shelter from the Puritans, thus providing its name.{{sfn|Plimpton|1994|p=175}}  Here Dyer was able to commune with her fellow Quakers, including her Newport neighbors, [[William Coddington]] and his wife Anne Brinley, who had recently converted.{{sfn|Plimpton|1994|p=176}}  Dyer used her time here to mull over the vindication prepared by the Puritan authorities to send to England, concerning their actions against the Quakers.  This document was an affront to Dyer, and she viewed it as merely a means to soften public outrage.{{sfn|Rogers|1896|pp=56-57}}  She was determined to return to Boston to force the authorities to either change their laws or to hang a woman, and she left Shelter Island in April 1660 focused on this mission.{{sfn|Plimpton|1994|p=182}}

== Dyer's martyrdom ==
[[File:Mary dyer being led.jpg|thumb|300px|Mary Dyer being led to her execution on 1 June 1660, by an unknown 19th-century artist]]

Dyer returned to Boston on 21 May 1660 and ten days later she was once again brought before the governor.  The exchange of words between Dyer and [[John Endecott|Governor Endicott]] was recorded as follows:

{{quote|Endicott:  Are you the same Mary Dyer that was here before?

Dyer:  I am the same Mary Dyer that was here the last General Court.

Endicott:  You will own yourself a Quaker, will you not?

Dyer:  I own myself to be reproachfully so called.

Endicott:  Sentence was passed upon you the last General Court; and now likewise--You must return to the prison, and there remain till to-morrow at nine o'clock; then thence you must go to the gallows and there be hanged till you are dead.

Dyer:  This is no more than what thou saidst before.

Endicott:  But now it is to be executed.  Therefore prepare yourself to-morrow at nine o'clock.

Dyer:  I came in obedience to the will of God the last General Court, desiring you to repeal your unrighteous laws of banishment on pain of death; and that same is my work now, and earnest request, although I told you that if you refused to repeal them, the Lord would send others of his servants to witness against them.{{sfn|Rogers|1896|pp=58-59}}|}}

Following this exchange, the governor asked if she was a prophetess, and she answered that she spoke the words that the Lord spoke to her.  When she began to speak again, the governor called, "Away with her!  Away with her!"  She was returned to jail.  Though her husband had written a letter to Endicott requesting his wife's freedom, another reprieve was not granted.{{sfn|Rogers|1896|pp=58-59}}

[[File:JohnWilson 1stChurch Boston.png|thumb|right|Reverend [[John Wilson (minister)|John Wilson]] implored Dyer to repent, but she said, "Nay, man, I am not now to repent."]]

On 1 June 1660, at nine in the morning, Mary Dyer once again departed the jail and was escorted to the gallows.  Once she was on the ladder under the elm tree she was given the opportunity to save her life.  Her response was, "Nay, I cannot; for in obedience to the will of the Lord God I came, and in his will I abide faithful to the death."{{sfn|Rogers|1896|p=60}}  The military commander, [[Captain John Evered|Captain John Webb]], recited the charges against her and said she "was guilty of her own blood."{{sfn|Rogers|1896|p=60}}  Dyer's response was:

{{quote|Nay, I came to keep bloodguiltiness from you, desiring you to repeal the unrighteous and unjust law of banishment upon pain of death, made against the innocent servants of the Lord, therefore my blood will be required at your hands who willfully do it; but for those that do is in the simplicity of their hearts, I do desire the Lord to forgive them.  I came to do the will of my Father, and in obedience to his will I stand even to the death.{{sfn|Rogers|1896|pp=60-61}}{{sfn|Sewel|1844|p=291}}|Dyer's words as she prepared to hang|}}

Her former pastor, John Wilson, urged her to repent and to not be "so deluded and carried away by the deceit of the devil."{{sfn|Rogers|1896|p=61}}  To this she answered, "Nay, man, I am not now to repent."  Asked if she would have the elders pray for her, she replied, "I know never an Elder here."  Another short exchange followed, and then, in the words of her biographer, Horatio Rogers, "she was swung off, and the crown of martyrdom descended upon her head."{{sfn|Rogers|1896|pp=61-62}}

=== Burial ===
The Friends' records of Portsmouth, Rhode Island contain the following entry: "Mary Dyer the wife of William Dyer of Newport in Rhode Island:  she was put to death at the Town of Boston with ye like cruil hand as the martyrs were in [[Mary I of England|Queen Mary]]'s time, and there buried upon ye 31 day of ye 3d mo. 1660."  In the calendar used at the time, May was the third month of the year, but the date in the record is incorrect by a day, as the actual date of death was 1 June.{{sfn|Rogers|1896|p=63}}  Also, this entry states that Mary was buried there in Boston where she was hanged, and biographer Rogers echoed this, but this is not likely.  Johan Winsser presents evidence that Mary was buried on the Dyer family farm, located north of Newport where the [[Naval Station Newport|Navy base]] is now situated in the current town of Middletown.  The strongest evidence found is the 1839 journal entry given by Daniel Wheeler, who wrote, "Before reaching Providence [coming from Newport], the site of the dwelling, and burying place of Mary Dyer was shown me."{{sfn|Dyer's Grave|2014}}  Winsser provides other items of evidence lending credence to this notion; it is unlikely that Dyer's remains would have been left in Boston since she had a husband, many children, and friends living in Newport, Rhode Island.{{sfn|Dyer's Grave|2014}}

=== Aftermath ===
In his ''History of Boston'', Dr. Caleb Snow wrote that one of the officers attending the hanging, Edward Wanton, was so overcome by the execution that he became a Quaker convert.{{sfn|Rogers|1896|p=62}}  The Wantons later became one of the leading Quaker families in Rhode Island, and two of Wanton's sons, [[William Wanton|William]] and [[John Wanton|John]], and two of his grandsons, [[Gideon Wanton|Gideon]] and [[Joseph Wanton]], became governors of the Rhode Island Colony.{{sfn|Austin|1887|p=215}}

[[Humphrey Atherton]], a prominent Massachusetts official and one of Dyer's persecutors, wrote, "Mary Dyer did hang as a flag for others to take example by."{{sfn|Rogers|1896|p=67}}  Atherton died on 16 September 1661 following a fall from a horse, and many Quakers viewed this as God's wrath sent upon him for his harshness towards their sect.{{sfn|Woodward|1869|p=6}}

A strong reaction from a contemporary woman and friend of Mary Dyer came from Anne Brinley Coddington, with whom Dyer spent her final winter on Shelter Island.  Anne Coddington sent a scathing letter to the Massachusetts magistrates, singling out Governor Endicott's role in the execution.  In addition, her husband, [[William Coddington]] sent several letters to the Connecticut governor, [[John Winthrop, Jr.]], condemning the execution.{{sfn|Plimpton|1994|pp=191-194}}

While news of Dyer's hanging was quick to spread through the American colonies and England, there was no immediate response from London because of the political turbulence, resulting in the restoration of the [[Charles II of England|king]] to power in 1660.  One more Quaker was martyred at the hands of the Puritans, William Leddra of the Barbadoes, who was hanged in March 1661.{{sfn|Rogers|1896|p=67}}  A few months later, however, the English Quaker activist [[Edward Burrough]] was able to get an appointment with the king.  In a document dated 9 September 1661 and addressed to Endicott and all other governors in New England, the king directed that executions and imprisonments of Quakers cease, and that any offending Quaker be sent to England for trial under the existing English law.{{sfn|Plimpton|1994|pp=196-197}}

While the royal response put an end to executions, the Puritans continued to find ways to harangue the Quakers who came to Massachusetts.  In 1661 they passed the "Cart and Tail Law", having Quakers tied to carts, stripped to the waist, and dragged through various towns behind the cart, being whipped en route, until they were taken out of the colony.{{sfn|Plimpton|1994|p=204}}  At about the time that Endicott died in 1665, a royal commission directed that all legal actions taken against Quakers would cease.  Nevertheless, whippings and imprisonments continued into the 1670s, after which popular sentiment, coupled with the royal directives, finally put an end to the Quaker persecution.{{sfn|Rogers|1896|p=67}}{{sfn|Plimpton|1994|p=205}}

== Modern view ==
{{Underlinked|section|date=July 2018}}
According to literary scholar Anne Myles, the life of Mary Dyer "functions as a powerful, almost allegorical example of a woman returning, over and over, to the same power-infused site of legal and discursive control."   The only first-hand evidence available as to the thoughts and motives of Dyer lie in the letters that she wrote.  But Myles sees her behavior as "a richly legible text of female agency, affiliation, and dissent."{{sfn|Myles|2001|p=8}}  Looking at Burrough's account of the conversation between Dyer and Governor Endicott, Myles views the two most important dimensions as being agency and affiliation. The first is that Dyer's actions "can be read as staging a public drama of agency," a means for women, including female prophets, to act under the power and will of God.  While Quaker women were allowed to preach, they were not being assertive when doing so because they were actually "preaching against their own wills and minds."{{sfn|Myles|2001|p=8}}

Dyer possessed a "vigorous intentionality" in engaging with the magistrates and ministers, both in her speech and in her behavior.  Even though those who chronicled her actions and life, such as Burroughs and Rogers, looked at her as being submissive to the will of God, she was nevertheless the active participant in her fate, voluntarily choosing to become a martyr.  She took full responsibility for her actions, while imploring the Puritan authorities to assume their moral responsibility for her death.  This provides a distinguishing feature between Dyer and Anne Hutchinson, the latter of whom may not have fully comprehended the consequences of her behavior.  While Dyer's husband and those unsympathetic to her labelled her as having a "madness", it is clear from her letters and her spoken words that her purpose and intentions were displayed with the utmost clarity of mind.{{sfn|Myles|2001|pp=8-9}}

During her dialogues, while walking to the gallows, or standing on the ladder under the hanging tree, Dyer exchanged a series of "yeas" and "nays" with her detractors.  With these affirmations and negations, she was refusing to allow others to construct her meaning.  She refuted the image of her as a sinner in need of repentance, and contested the authority of the elders of the church.  Just like Hutchinson's befuddling of her accusers during her civil trial, Dyer did not allow her interrogators to feel assured in how they framed her meaning.{{sfn|Myles|2001|p=10}}

While agency is the first of two dimensions of Dyer's story, the second is allegiance.  Dyer became a known in the public eye on the day when Anne Hutchinson was excommunicated, and Dyer took her hand while they walked out of the meeting house together.  Dyer had a strong affiliation and allegiance to this older woman who shared the secret of her unfortunate birth.  Likewise, two decades later she framed her acts as a means to stand by her friends and share in their fate.{{sfn|Myles|2001|p=10}}  In the first of two letters of Dyer's that have been preserved, she wrote to the General Court, "if my Life were freely granted by you, it would not avail me, nor could I expect it of you, so long as I should daily hear or see the Sufferings of these People, my dear Brethren and Seed, with whom my Life is bound up, as I have done these two years".{{sfn|Rogers|1896|p=35}}  Traditional bonds for females were to spouses and children, yet in the Quaker community there were strong spiritual bonds that transcended gender boundaries.  Thus the Puritan public found it very unusual that Dyer walked to the gallows hand-in-hand between two male friends, and she was asked if she was not ashamed of doing so.  This spiritual closeness of the Quakers was very threatening to the Puritan mindset where allegiance was controlled by the male church members.  The Quakers allowed their personal bonds to transgress not only gender lines but also the boundaries of age and class.{{sfn|Myles|2001|pp=10-11}}

In her first letter to the General Court, Dyer used the themes of agency and allegiance in creating an analogy between her witnessing in Massachusetts with the [[Book of Esther]]. Esther, a [[Jew]], was called upon to save her people after the evil [[Haman]] urged the king to enact a law to have all Jews put to death.  It was Esther's intercession with the king that saved her people, and the parallels are that Dyer is the beautiful Esther, with wicked Haman representing the Massachusetts authorities, and the Jews of the Bible being the Quakers of Dyer's time.{{sfn|Myles|2001|pp=12-14}}  Ultimately, Dyer's martyrdom did have the desired effect.  Unlike the story of Anne Hutchinson, that was narrated for more than a century by only her enemies, the orthodox Puritans, Dyer's story became the story of the Quakers, and it was quickly shared in England, and eventually made its way before the English King, [[Charles II of England|Charles II]].  The king ordered an end to the capital punishments, though the severe treatment continued for several more years.{{sfn|Myles|2001|pp=12-14}}

According to Myles, Dyer's life journey during her time in New England transformed her from "a silenced object to a speaking subject; from an Antinomian monster to a Quaker martyr".{{sfn|Myles|2001|p=2}}  The evidence from a personal standpoint and from the standpoint of all Quakers, suggests that Dyer's ending was as much a spiritual triumph as it was a tragic injustice.{{sfn|Myles|2001|pp=15-17}}

In Portsmouth, Rhode Island, Mary Dyer and her friend [[Anne Hutchinson]] have been remembered at Founders Brook Park with the Anne Hutchinson/Mary Dyer Memorial Herb Garden, a medicinal botanical garden, set by a scenic waterfall with a historical marker for the early settlement of Portsmouth.{{sfn|Heritage Passage}}  The garden was created by artist and herbalist Michael Steven Ford, who is a descendant of both women.  The memorial was a grass roots effort by a local Newport organization, the Anne Hutchinson Memorial Committee headed by Newport artist, Valerie Debrule. The organization, called Friends of Anne Hutchinson, meets annually at the memorial in Portsmouth, on the Sunday nearest to 20 July, the date of Anne's baptism, to celebrate her life and the local colonial history of the women of Aquidneck Island.{{sfn|Herald News|2011}}

== Published works ==
Three adult biographies of Mary Dyer have been published, the first being ''Mary Dyer of Rhode Island, the Quaker Martyr That Was Hanged on Boston Common, June 1, 1660'' by Horatio Rogers (1896) and the second being ''Mary Dyer: Biography of a Rebel Quaker'' by Ruth Plimpton (1994), and the third, ''Mary and William Dyer: Quaker Light and Puritan Ambition in Early New England'' by Johan Winsser (2017). A biography for middle-school students, ''Mary Dyer, Friend of Freedom'' by John Briggs, was published in 2014. While Dyer published no works herself, she did write two letters which have been preserved, both of them focal to her martyrdom, and both of them published in her biographies.{{sfn|Plimpton|1994|p=i}}{{sfn|Rogers|1896|p=i}}{{sfn|Briggs|2014|p=i}} She is the only woman associated with the [[Antinomian Controversy]] who produced any published texts.{{sfn|Myles|2001|p=2}}

A play titled ''The Joy,'' by [[Jeanmarie Simpson]], about the life of Mary Dyer, was published in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Joy|last=Bishop|first=Jeanmarie (Simpson)|publisher=CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform|year=2016|isbn=978-1532756979|location=United States|page=76|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Children and descendants ==
[[File:RI Governor Elisha Dyer.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Rhode Island Governor [[Elisha Dyer]] descends from Mary Dyer]]

Mary Dyer had eight known children, six of whom grew to adulthood.  Following her martyrdom, her husband remarried and had one more known child, and possibly others.  Her oldest child, William, was baptized at [[St Martin-in-the-Fields]] (London) on 24 October 1634 and was buried there three days later.  After sailing to New England, her second child, Samuel, was baptized at the Boston church on 20 December 1635 and married by 1663 to Anne Hutchinson, the daughter of [[Edward Hutchinson (captain)|Edward Hutchinson]] and the granddaughter of [[William Hutchinson (Rhode Island)|William]] and [[Anne Hutchinson]].  Her third child was the premature stillborn female, born 17 October 1637, discussed earlier.  Henry, born roughly 1640, was the fourth child, and he married Elizabeth Sanford, the daughter of John Sanford, Jr., and the granddaughter of Governor [[John Sanford (governor)|John Sanford]].{{Sfn|Anderson|Sanborn|Sanborn|2001|pp=382-383}}

The fifth child was a second William, born about 1642, who married Mary, possibly a daughter of Richard Walker of Lynn, Massachusetts, but no evidence supports this.  Child number six was a male and given the Biblical name Mahershallalhashbaz.  He was married to Martha Pearce, the daughter of Richard Pearce.  Mary was the seventh child, born roughly 1647, and married by about 1675 Henry Ward; they were living in Cecil County, Maryland, in January 1679.  Mary Dyer's youngest child was Charles, born roughly 1650, whose first wife was named Mary; there are unsupported claims that she was a daughter of John Lippett.  Charles married second after 1690 Martha (Brownell) Wait, who survived him.{{Sfn|Anderson|Sanborn|Sanborn|2001|pp=382-383}}

There is no evidence that Mary's husband, William Dyer, ever became a Quaker.  However, her two sons, Samuel and Mahershallalhashbaz, were likely Quakers because they were required to appear before the General Court of Trials at Portsmouth, Rhode Island to face charges for not serving in the military.  In general, Quakers refused to serve in the military, and the charges were eventually dropped.  There was a lot of litigation concerning the estate of William Dyer, Sr; his widow, Katherine, took both the widow of his son Samuel and later his son Charles to court over the estate, likely feeling that more of his estate belonged to his children with her.{{Sfn|Anderson|Sanborn|Sanborn|2001|pp=384-385}}

Notable descendants of Mary Dyer include Rhode Island Governors [[Elisha Dyer]] and [[Elisha Dyer, Jr.]], and U.S. Senator from Rhode Island, [[Jonathan Chace]].{{sfn|Rogers|1896|p=34}}

([https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0775180/ IMDB bio]: "Date of Birth: 6 September 1879," ... "born on June 11, 1879" ... "Date of Death 26 November 1936," ... "death from a heart attack on February 19, 1936")&lt;/ref&gt; was a German actor, best known for his lead role as the [[vampire]] [[Count Orlok]] in the film ''[[Nosferatu]]'' (1922).

==Biography==
===Early life===
Max Schreck was  born in [[Friedenau|Berlin-Friedenau]], on 6 September 1879. Six years later, his father bought a house in the independent rural community of Friedenau, then part of the district of Teltow.

His father did not approve of Schreck's ever-growing enthusiasm for theater. Schreck's mother provided the boy with money, which he secretly used for acting lessons, although only after the death of his father did he attend drama school. After graduating, he travelled briefly across the country with poet and dramatist [[Demetrius Schrutz]].

Schreck had engagements in [[Mulhouse]], [[Międzyrzec Podlaski|Meseritz]], [[Speyer]], [[Rudolstadt]], [[Erfurt]] and [[Weissenfels]], and his first extended stay at the Gera Theater. Greater engagements followed, especially in Frankfurt am Main. From there he went to [[Berlin]] for [[Max Reinhardt (theatre director)|Max Reinhardt]] and the Munich Chamber Games for [[Otto Falckenberg]]. From then on he began to work in films.

Schreck received his training at the Berliner Staatstheater (State Theatre of [[Berlin]]), completing it in 1902.&lt;ref name=Walk/&gt; He made his stage début in [[Międzyrzec Podlaski|Meseritz]] and [[Speyer]], and then toured Germany for two years, appearing at theatres in [[Zittau]], [[Erfurt]], [[Bremen (city)|Bremen]],&lt;ref name=Walk/&gt; [[Lucerne]],&lt;ref name=Walk/&gt; [[Gera]],&lt;ref name=Walk/&gt; and [[Frankfurt am Main]].&lt;ref name=Walk/&gt; Schreck then joined [[Max Reinhardt (theatre director)|Max Reinhardt]]'s company of performers in Berlin.&lt;ref name=missing&gt;[http://www.missinglinkclassichorror.co.uk/max.htm Enigmatic Max: The career of Max Schreck]. Retrieved 26 December 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Many members of Reinhardt's troupe went on to make significant contributions to the German film industry.&lt;ref name=missing/&gt;

===Career===
[[File:Schreck.jpg|thumb|right|Max Schreck in ''[[Nosferatu]]'' (1922)]]
For three years between 1919 and 1922, Schreck appeared at the [[Munich Kammerspiele]],&lt;ref name=missing/&gt; including a role in the [[expressionism|expressionist]] production of [[Bertolt Brecht]]'s début, {{lang|de|Trommeln in der Nacht}} (''[[Drums in the Night]]'') (in which he played the "freakshow landlord" Glubb).&lt;ref&gt;[[#Brecht|Brecht, Willett and Manheim (1970, ix)]]&lt;/ref&gt; During this time he also worked on his first film ''[[The Mayor of Zalamea (1920 film)|The Mayor of Zalamea]]'', adapted from a six-act play, for Decla Bioscop.&lt;ref name=missing/&gt; In 1921, he was hired by [[Prana Film]] for its first and only production, ''[[Nosferatu]]''. The company declared itself [[bankrupt]] after the film was released to avoid paying [[copyright infringement]] costs to ''[[Dracula]]'' author [[Bram Stoker]]'s widow, [[Florence Balcombe|Florence Stoker]].&lt;ref name=missing/&gt; Schreck portrayed [[Count Orlok]], a character analogous to [[Count Dracula]].&lt;ref name=missing/&gt;

In 1923, while still in Munich, Schreck appeared in a 16-minute (one-reeler) [[slapstick]], "surreal comedy" written by [[Bertolt Brecht]] with cabaret and stage actors [[Karl Valentin]], Liesl Karlstadt, [[Erwin Faber]], and Blandine Ebinger, entitled {{lang|de|Mysterien eines Friseursalons}} (''[[Mysteries of a Barbershop]]''), directed by Erich Engel.&lt;ref&gt;McDowell, W. Stuart. "A Brecht-Valentin Production: ''Mysteries of a Barbershop''", ''Performing Arts Journal'', Vol. 1, No. 3 (Winter, 1977), pp. 2-14; and "Acting Brecht: The Munich Years," by W. Stuart McDowell, in ''The Brecht Sourcebook'', Carol Martin, Henry Bial, editors (Routledge, 2000) p. 71 - 83.&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 1923, Schreck appeared as a blind man in the film {{lang|de|[[Die Straße]]}} (''The Street'').&lt;ref name=Brill&gt;[[#Brill|Brill, Olaf. 2004]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=missing/&gt;

Schreck's second collaboration with ''Nosferatu'' director [[F. W. Murnau]] was the 1924 comedy {{lang|de|Die Finanzen des Grossherzogs}} (''[[The Grand Duke's Finances]]'').&lt;ref name=missing/&gt; Even Murnau did not hesitate to declare his contempt for the picture.&lt;ref name=missing/&gt; In 1926, Schreck returned to the Kammerspiele in Munich and continued to act in films surviving the advent of sound until his death in 1936 of [[heart failure]].&lt;ref name="Gra2"/&gt; 

===Personal life===
[[File:Max schreck little girl.jpg|right|thumb|Schreck in ''[[Die Straße]]'' (1923)]]
Schreck was married to actress [[Fanny Normann]],&lt;ref name=missing/&gt; who appeared in a few films, often credited as Fanny Schreck.

One of Schreck's contemporaries recalled that he was a loner with an unusual sense of humor and skill in playing grotesque characters. He also reported that he lived in "a remote and incorporeal world" and that he often spent time walking through forests.&lt;ref name="Gra2"&gt;[[#Graham|Graham 2008]] [https://www.reuters.com/article/oddlyEnoughNews/idUSL0983779720080509?pageNumber=2&amp;virtualBrandChannel=0 Page 2]. Retrieved 2008-12-26&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death===
On 19 February 1936, Schreck had just played The Grand Inquisitor in the play {{lang|fr|[[Don Carlos]]}}, standing in for [[Will Dohm]]. That evening he felt unwell and the doctor sent him to the hospital where he died early the next morning of a heart attack.&lt;ref name=obituary&gt;[[#Brill|Brill 2004]], Peter Trumm: obituary in {{lang|de|Münchner Neueste Nachrichten}} vol. 89, no. 52, on 21 February 1936. {{lang|de|"am Donnerstag früh um einhalb neun Uhr im Schwabinger Krankenhaus gestorben"}} (ie. 08:30 in the morning of February 20, 1936)&lt;/ref&gt; His [[obituary]] especially praised his role as [[The Miser]] in [[Molière]]'s comedy play.&lt;ref name=obituary/&gt; He was buried on 14 March 1936 at Wilmersdorfer Waldfriedhof Stahnsdorf in [[Brandenburg]].&lt;ref name=Brill/&gt;

[[File:A Child of the Honigh Family on its Deathbed.jpg|thumb|''A Child of the Honigh Family on its Deathbed'', by an unknown painter, 1675-1700]]
A '''mourning portrait''' or '''deathbed portrait''' is a portrait of a person who has recently died, usually shown on their deathbed, or [[lying in repose]], displayed for mourners. Though it seems like a morbid subject now, these were not rare in European homes of well-to-do people as a way of remembering and honoring the dead. Generally the name of the painter is unknown. Generally people were laid out in their best clothes with some sort of special headdress, and some sort of token in their hands. Today these portraits give insights into old funeral customs, but also various types of information regarding folk costumes.  In the 19th century [[post-mortem photography]] continued the tradition.

Recent research on deathbed portraits, which can be found also in prints and photographs up to today, shows that they became popular after the [[Protestant Reformation]] but were never treasured as family heirlooms in the same way as other artworks and thus relatively few early examples such as this one have survived. As a continuous art form, laying out traditions did not go away and photography has continued to preserve the deathbed portrait, though such photos were meant for mourners and did not find their way into photo albums. 

In the Netherlands, complicated wreaths of greens were placed around the heads of unmarried people, who were mostly children.&lt;ref name=Pelen&gt;[http://www.benhartman.nl/begrafenisrituelen/afleggen/versieren-pelen-van-het-lijk/ Afleggen en versieren van het lijk] ''Laying out and "palling" of the body'' on Dutch website&lt;/ref&gt;  In Dutch such a wreath is called a "hoedje" (little hat) and this is part of the general body decoration called "pelen".&lt;ref&gt;''Naar het lijk: het Nederlandse doodsportret 1500-heden'', catalog of [[Teylers Museum]] exhibition by Bert Sliggers, Walburg Pers, Zutphen, 1998 {{ISBN|9789057300424}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word "pelen" is related to the English word "pall", as in "pallbearer", which in funeral contexts refers to the cloth (sometimes a flag) over the body or casket.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

An example of this type of portrait is the ''Mourning portrait of K. Horvath-Stansith, née Kiss'', an 1680s painting by an anonymous Baroque artist in the [[Slovak National Gallery]].&lt;ref name=museum&gt;[http://www.webumenia.sk/dielo/SVK:SNG.O_4842 collection record] on museum website&lt;/ref&gt;

This painting shows a postmortem portrait of a woman from the Horvath-Stansith family, K. Horvath-Stansith. She appears to be lying on a bed, but her body has been specially prepared and she is lying not on a bed, but a prepared [[catafalque]] laid with a [[Kilim]] carpet and special red [[damask]] cushion. Her fingers have already discoloured and thread is wrapped around her thumbs. Theoretically, the location is her local church and this is how she looked during the funeral service. She is wearing the costume of the former Hungarian region of [[Levoča]] and the closefitting cap she has on is probably not the headgear she wore when she was alive.

'''''Murder Collection V.1''''' is a 2009 American horror [[anthology film]] written and directed by [[Fred Vogel]], and co-written by Don Moore, Shelby Vogel and Jerami Cruise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author = Steve Jones|title = Torture Porn: Popular Horror after Saw|url = http://www.palgrave.com/us/book/9780230319417|accessdate = 25 February 2016|year = 2013|publisher = [[Palgrave Macmillan]]|isbn = 9781137317124|page = 174}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author = Alexandra Heller-Nicholas|title = Found Footage Horror Films: Fear and the Appearance of Reality|url = http://www.mcfarlandbooks.com/book-2.php?id=978-0-7864-7077-8|accessdate = 25 February 2016|year = 2014|publisher = [[McFarland &amp; Company]]|isbn = 9780786470778|page = 194}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plot ==
The film's opening explains that in 1994 a [[web series]] called ''Murder'', which broadcast footage of actual deaths and acts of violence, appeared. After being active for four months, ''Murder'' was shut down by the authorities and had all of its content confiscated, though the website's host, a man known only as Balan, evaded capture. Now, years later, Balan has reemerged to share more clips that he has unearthed, while also offering commentary on people's obsession with death, the effect it has on them, and how accessible [[new media]] has made it. The series of videos is kicked off by Balan querying, "I ask you all... Why are you watching? Are you trying to find reality? Do you feel the need to be shocked? To witness something that human eyes shouldn't see? Murder is reality. Death comes when you least expect it. With what you are about to observe, you may question your own integrity. You will ask, could this happen to me? My answer to you is... Yes it can."

* '''Bludgeoning:''' A drunk Russian man accidentally beats his teenage son to death in front of the son's [[webcam]].
* '''The Heist:''' A restaurant's security system records a robbery committed by four gunmen, who shoot a cashier in the head and a fleeing customer in the back.
* '''The Cheat:''' In front of a stationary camera a man, Greg reminisces about how he met his wife, and about all of the good times that they shared, while a monitor in the background shows his wife having sex with someone else. The man leaves the room, and the monitor shows him barging in on his wife and her lover, hacking the former to death with an ax before cutting out her heart, which the wife had once said would always belong to him.
* '''S&amp;G:''' A parking lot security camera catches two people attacking a couple, beating the man with a baseball bat, and abducting the woman.
* '''Broadway Rob:''' The distorted home movie of a pedophile, Broadway Rob who forces two gagged boys, Shawn and Ben clad in only their socks and underwear to dance with him. Shawn tackles Rob, fatally strangling and stabbing him. Shawn and Ben flee, leaving Rob's dead body behind.
* '''Execution:''' A muffled black and white [[camcorder]] video of a hooded and masked group (possibly a [[cult]] or a gang) executing a man via decapitation in front of a woman, whom they taunt with the severed head before shooting her.
* '''ATM:''' A man is mugged and killed at an [[Automated teller machine|ATM]].
* '''Autopsy:''' Japanese autopsy footage of a woman who was shot in the mouth, with the bullet exiting the top of her skull. The coroner eventually kicks the cameraman out due to his unprofessional antics and inattentiveness.
* '''Bullied:''' A trio of drunks use a camcorder to record themselves taking a man out into the woods under the pretense of initiating him into their group. The three bully and humiliate the man and, during a scuffle, one of them accidentally knocks him onto the knife another was holding. The trio panic and bicker, and the camera is dropped when a fight breaks out over whether they should go for help.
* '''Homecoming:''' A building security camera records two figures [[Garrote|garroting]] a man.
* '''Ransom:''' A deteriorated series of [[ransom]] videos depict three men brutalizing a [[Senate|senator's]] daughter, who eventually dies due to the severity of her injuries.

After the last clip, Balan delivers the closing statement, "You realize now it's everywhere. Death casts a shadow on all our faces. The new media shines light on dank crevasses, revealing moral decay and broken experiences that are better left beyond the pale. Goosebumps explode on my skin with every clip we watch. I feel it now more than ever. How do you feel?"

== Reception ==
Ryan Doom of [[JoBlo.com|Arrow in the Head]] gave ''Murder Collection V.1'' a 2/4 and wrote, "In the end, I think it's an interesting exercise, but I don't know if it makes it a good movie. This isn't the type of film that I suspect most viewers would revisit often, if at all. Instead, it's just an experiment that people will dig or not, depending on how much violence and gore they can stomach without a story for context. While it captivated me at times with certain segments, others seemed unnecessary or overdone. But maybe that's just me".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.joblo.com/horror-movies/dvd-reviews/murder-collection-v1|title = ''Murder Collection V.1''|last = Doom|first = Ryan|publisher = Arrow in the Head|date = |website = joblo.com|accessdate = 25 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Horror News's Jay Alan praised the special effects, also calling the acting "convincingly believable for the most part" and writing, "As much as the film focuses on the graphic and dark nature of death, it also delves into the human psyche and personalities of the characters within the little given time shown."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://horrornews.net/30431/film-review-murder-collection-vol-1-2009/|title = Film Review: ''Murder Collection Vol. 1'' (2009)|last = Alan|first = Jay|publisher = Horror News|date = 2 November 2011|website = horrornews.net|accessdate = 25 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sultan Muzaffar Shah II''' (1546–1570) was the second [[Sultan of Johor]]. He was known as ''Raja Muda Perdana'' before he succeeded the throne. He was installed to the throne of [[Johor Sultanate|Johor]] in 1564 by the [[Acehnese people|Acehnese]] upon the death of his father, [[Alauddin Riayat Shah II of Johor|Sultan Alauddin Riayat Shah II]], who died shortly after he was captured and brought back to [[Aceh]] after the Acehnese invasion of Johor.

Muzaffar II moved his capital to [[Seluyut]] in 1565 from [[Johor Lama]] to assert his independence from the Acehnese. He died in 1570 of poison and was succeeded by [[Abdul Jalil I of Johor|Sultan Abdul Jalil Shah I]].

==Personal life==
He had three wives. His first wife was [[Tun Mas Jiwa]], daughter of the [[temenggung]], [[Tun Hassan]]. His second wife was [[Tun Trang]], daughter of [[Tun Ali bin Tun Tahir|Tun Ali]], Seri Nara Diraja of [[Pahang]], and [[Tun Fatimah]]. Tun Trang bore him two sons, [[Abdul Jalil I of Johor|Abdul Jalil I]] and Raja Radin. His third wife was the former wife of [[Ali Jalla Abdul Jalil II of Johor|Sultan Ali Jalla Abdul Jalil Shah II]] and daughter of Sultan Husain Ali Riayat Shah of [[Aceh Sultanate|Aceh]].

In psychology, '''parallel processing''' is the ability of the [[brain]] to simultaneously process incoming stimuli of differing quality.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite journal | last=LaBerge | first=David | last2=Samuels | first2=S.Jay | title=Toward a theory of automatic information processing in reading | journal=Cognitive Psychology | publisher=Elsevier BV | volume=6 | issue=2 | year=1974 | issn=0010-0285 | doi=10.1016/0010-0285(74)90015-2 | pages=293–323 | ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parallel processing is a part of [[Visual perception|vision]] in that the brain divides what it sees into four components: [[color]], [[motion (physics)|motion]], [[shape]], and [[Distance|depth]]. These are individually analyzed and then compared to stored [[memory|memories]], which helps the brain identify what you are viewing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Hinton | first=Geoffrey | title=Parallel models of associative memory | publisher=Psychology Press | publication-place=New York | year=2014 | isbn=978-1-315-80799-7 | ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The brain then combines all of these into the field of view that you see and comprehend.&lt;ref name="Wässle2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wässle|first1=Heinz|title=Parallel processing in the mammalian retina|journal=Nature Reviews Neuroscience|volume=5|issue=10|year=2004|pages=747–757|issn=1471-003X|doi=10.1038/nrn1497}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parallel processing has been linked, by some experimental psychologists, to the [[Stroop effect]]. This is a continual and seamless operation.

'''Perry County Jane Doe''', also nicknamed as "'''Girl with the Turquoise Jewelry'''"&lt;ref name=ties/&gt; is an unidentified woman whose body was found on June 20, 1979, in [[Watts Township, Perry County, Pennsylvania]], near the [[Juniata River]]. The cause of her death is not known, but it was considered to be suspicious by the authorities.&lt;ref name=suspicious/&gt;&lt;ref name=girl/&gt;&lt;ref name=namus&gt;{{cite web|title=NamUs UP # 5166|url=https://identifyus.org/cases/5166|website=identifyus.org|publisher=[[National Missing and Unidentified Persons System]]|accessdate=24 August 2014|date=5 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her name is still not known, despite efforts to identify her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Johnson|first1=Jeffery A.|title=State police release sketch of woman whose body was found in 1979 in Perry County|url=http://www.pennlive.com/midstate/index.ssf/2013/05/state_police_release_sketch_of.html|accessdate=27 November 2014|work=The Patriot News|date=30 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NCMEC&gt;{{cite web|title=Jane Doe 1979|url=http://www.missingkids.org/poster/NCMC/1192091/1#poster|website=missingkids.org|publisher=[[National Center for Missing and Exploited Children]]|accessdate=24 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=doe&gt;{{cite web|title=Case File 11UFPA|url=http://doenetwork.org/cases/11ufpa.html|website=doenetwork.org|publisher=[[The Doe Network]]|accessdate=24 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is the only [[unidentified decedent]] in the county.&lt;ref name=ties/&gt;

==Description==
The badly decomposed remains were found by a "stone mason" alongside a river, near a highway in [[Perry County, Pennsylvania]], near [[Watts Township, Perry County, Pennsylvania|Watts Township]].&lt;ref name=ties/&gt; The remains were mostly skeletonized and the estimated time of death was months before, perhaps as early as Autumn of 1978.&lt;ref name=namus/&gt;&lt;ref name=doe/&gt;

The decedent is believed to have been between 15 and 30 years old, although she may have been as old as 38.&lt;ref name=namus/&gt;
She was [[White American|white]], had straight, shoulder-length [[blond]] or light [[brown hair]] and was between 5 feet 2 inches and 5 feet 9 inches tall.&lt;ref name=girl/&gt;&lt;ref name=doe/&gt;

She had received [[dentistry|dental care]] during her life, as a back tooth had been removed four or five years prior to her death. She also had [[dental filling|teeth fillings]]. One tooth, which was a [[molar (tooth)|molar]], had not yet erupted.&lt;ref name=doe/&gt; Her teeth showed no evidence of crowding. Despite that her teeth appeared to have had some dental work, it is not known if she had ever had braces.&lt;ref name=suspicious&gt;{{cite web|title=SUSPICIOUS DEATH/UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE - WATTS TOWNSHIP, PERRY COUNTY, PENNSYLVANIA|url=https://www.crimewatchpa.com/crimestoppers/316/cases/suspicious-deathunidentified-female-watts-township-perry-county-pennsylvania|website=crimewatchpa.com|publisher=Pennsylvania Crime Stoppers|accessdate=24 August 2014|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to her death, she had suffered a fractured [[rib]], which had healed.&lt;ref name=NCMEC/&gt; Just before her death, she may have returned to Pennsylvania after having spent several months in the southwestern United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New lead on Jane Doe found in Pennsylvania|url=https://www.facebook.com/notes/help-id-me/new-lead-on-jane-doe-found-in-pennsylvania/991211054240135?notif_t=notify_me|publisher=National Center for Missing &amp; Exploited Children|accessdate=22 January 2015|date=22 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent analysis of the decedent's bones indicated that she had spent a long time living in the [[Midwest]] or in Canada, near the [[Great Lakes]], when she was an adolescent.&lt;ref name=NCMEC/&gt;

==Belongings==
[[File:Perry Jewelry.jpg|300px|thumb|Jewelry worn by Perry County Jane Doe.]]

Perry County Jane Doe wore several pieces of [[jewelry]]. She was wearing two [[sterling silver]] rings with [[turquoise]] stones, one of which also contained [[onyx]] pieces that are believed to have originated in the Southwest, possibly having been made by [[Navajo people|Navajo]] or [[Zuni people|Zuni]] Indians inhabiting that area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=FBI's Nameless Victims Of Violent Crime|url=http://www.ksbw.com/news/16416160#!bJhwpa|accessdate=24 August 2014|agency=KSBW News|publisher=ABC|date=5 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also had a chain bracelet on her right arm and a turquoise necklace and earrings.&lt;ref name=suspicious/&gt;&lt;ref name=NCMEC/&gt; The jewelry led authorities to believe the victim had ties to [[Arizona]], [[New Mexico]] or a similar region.&lt;ref name="ties"&gt;{{cite news|title=Does Pennsylvania suspicious death investigation have an Arizona link?|url=http://www.abc15.com/news/state/does-pennsylvania-suspicious-death-investigation-have-an-arizona-link|accessdate=26 February 2016|work=ABC 15 Arizona|publisher=Scripps Media, Inc|date=4 May 2013|location=Phoenix, Arizona}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She wore a tan jacket, white boots with silver buckles, green and white socks, and blue slacks.&lt;ref name=fbi&gt;{{cite web|title=JANE DOE Newport, Watts Township, Perry County, Pennsylvania|url=https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/vicap/unidentified-persons/@@wanted-group-scroll-view?selected-uid=cb6907bf45a260ecb8d8252ab909d08f|website=fbi.gov|publisher=[[Federal Bureau of Investigation]]|accessdate=24 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The slacks were described as having been made from knitted wool which contained strands of red thread.&lt;ref name=suspicious/&gt; She was wearing two [[Top (clothing)|tops]], which consisted of a white shirt and a blue [[Sleeveless shirt|tank top]].&lt;ref name=suspicious/&gt;&lt;ref name=namus/&gt;

==Investigation==
The victim had been buried shortly after her discovery, but was exhumed in 2008, following the reopening of her case.&lt;ref name=ties/&gt; Her [[DNA profiling|DNA]] and dental records were recorded and are on file. Because of the condition of her remains, no fingerprints and no cause of death could be confirmed.&lt;ref name=namus/&gt; An initial examination of her teeth indicated that she had had three teeth extracted, but this was later disproved.&lt;ref name=suspicious/&gt;&lt;ref name=namus/&gt;&lt;ref name=doe/&gt; Despite the fact that these characteristics have been entered into national databases, there have been no matches with missing persons.&lt;ref name="ties" /&gt;

About sixty possible identities for her have been ruled out.&lt;ref name=girl&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lanyon|first1=Ali|title=Midstate Mysteries: The girl with the turquoise jewelry|url=http://www.abc27.com/story/22040531/midstate-mysteries-the-girl-with-the-turquoise-jewelry|accessdate=24 August 2014|agency=WHTM News|publisher=ABC|date=22 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her face was [[forensic facial reconstruction|reconstructed]] twice by professionals. A sketch by Barbara Martin-Bailey was drawn in 2009, and the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children created a three-dimensional rendering by digitally adding layers of muscles and skin to a [[CT scan]] of her skull, which was released in 2013. A revised image was later released in 2018.&lt;ref name=NCMEC/&gt;

'''''Phantasm''''' is a 1979 American [[horror film]] directed, written, photographed, and edited by [[Don Coscarelli]]. The first film in the [[Phantasm (franchise)|''Phantasm'' franchise]], it introduces the [[Tall Man (Phantasm)|Tall Man]] ([[Angus Scrimm]]), a supernatural and malevolent [[undertaker]] who turns the dead of earth into dwarf [[zombies]] to be sent to his planet and used as slaves.  He is opposed by a young boy, Mike ([[A. Michael Baldwin|Michael Baldwin]]), who tries to convince his older brother Jody (Bill Thornbury) and family friend Reggie ([[Reggie Bannister]]) of the threat.

''Phantasm'' was a locally financed [[independent film]]; the cast and crew were mostly amateurs and aspiring professionals.  Though initial reviews were mixed in regards to the dream-like, surreal narrative and imagery, later reception was more positive and the film became a [[cult classic]].  It has appeared on several critics' lists of best horror films, and it has been cited as an influence on later horror series. It was followed by four sequels: ''[[Phantasm II]]'' (1988), ''[[Phantasm III: Lord of the Dead]]'' (1994), ''[[Phantasm IV: Oblivion]]'' (1998) and ''[[Phantasm: Ravager]]'' (2016).

==Plot==
{{Long plot|date=July 2018}}
Tommy (Bill Cone) and the Lady In Lavender (Kathy Lester) have sex in Morningside Cemetery, after which the woman kills Tommy with a knife. Later, Tommy's friends, including 24-year-old musician Jody Pearson and family man Reggie, attend Tommy's funeral at Morningside, believing he committed suicide. Jody explains that he didn't bring his 13-year-old brother, Mike, because their parents died recently and he felt Mike would be traumatised by another funeral. However, Mike has been secretly observing the funeral from the bushes; after the mourners leave, Mike witnesses a tall man in a suit who seems to be the Morningside mortician lift Tommy's 500-pound casket with superhuman strength and load it into his hearse instead of completing the burial. He also seems to telekinetically knock Mike off his motorbike as he flees the cemetery.

Mike relays this story to a fortune teller (Mary Ellen Shaw) and her granddaughter (Terrie Kalbus), as well as his fears about the possibility of Jody departing and leaving him in the care of his aunt. Through her granddaughter, the fortune teller tells Mike not to worry about Jody, assuring him that Jody would take Mike along if he chose to leave town. Then, she seems to magically produce a small black box and instructs Mike to put his hand into it. After the box grips his hand, Mike is told not to be afraid, and as the panic subsides, the box relaxes its grip. After Mike leaves, the fortune teller's granddaughter investigates the Morningside mausoleum, where she finds a strange room filled with white light. She screams at what she sees, and is presumably killed. Later, the Lady in Lavender seduces Jody in a bar and takes him to Morningside Cemetery to have sex. Mike, who has taken to secretly following Jody in the wake of their parents' deaths, has an aggressive encounter with a short, hooded figure while spying on his brother. He runs screaming from the bushes, interrupting Jody mid-coitus. When Jody catches up to him, Mike frantically tries to tell him about the hooded figure, but Jody dismisses the story.  

After another violent encounter with more hooded figures and seeing the Tall Man walk down the street and react strangely to cold air coming out of Reggie's ice cream truck, Mike resolves to investigate Morningside and obtain proof of his suspicions to show to Jody. While exploring the mausoleum, a silver sphere flies through the air, narrowly missing Mike as he dives under it. He is accosted by a Morningside caretaker, but Mike escapes just as the sphere is making another pass; it impales itself in the caretaker's skull and drills into his brain, killing him. The Tall Man approaches Mike, but he escapes by exercising control over his fear, surprising the Tall Man and trapping his hand in a heavy door. Mike cuts the fingers off of the hand, causing the Tall Man to bellow an alien roar while yellow blood gushes from the wound. Mike takes one of the Tall Man's still-moving fingers and escapes the mausoleum, narrowly avoiding capture by the hooded figures. 

The finger is enough for Jody to believe Mike's stories about Morningside. Meanwhile, the finger transforms into a vicious, oversized fly-like insect that attacks Mike. Reggie coincidentally witnesses this, and joins the brothers in their suspicions about Morningside. Jody decides to go on his own investigation alone. He is chased away from Morningside by a seemingly driverless hearse, but is rescued by Mike in Jody's [[Plymouth Barracuda]]. The two run the hearse off the road and discover it was driven by one of the hooded figures, whom they discover to be a re-animated Tommy. Tommy's body has been unnaturally shortened, although he weighs significantly more than average. Reggie and Jody resolve to defeat the Tall Man. Mike is taken to an antique store owned by Jody's friend Sally (Lynn Eastman). There, Mike discovers an antique photograph of the Tall Man. Mike begs Sally to take him home; on the way they see Reggie's ice cream truck overturned. Mike finds a handprint melted into a block of ice with the same yellow blood that came out of the Tall Man. Mike tries to get Sally and her friend to leave the scene quickly, but all three are attacked by a mob of hooded dwarves. Mike survives by being thrown out of the back window, while the girls drive off into the night, screaming. Mike assumes they and Reggie are all dead. 

Jody locks Mike in his room to keep him safe, then goes to Morningside to execute his plan to kill the Tall Man. Mike escapes his bedroom and tries to leave to help Jody, but the Tall Man is waiting for him outside his front door. He kidnaps Mike in a hearse, but Mike thwarts him by shooting out the back window and a rear tire, causing the hearse to strike a pole and explode. While looking for Jody in Morningside, Mike opens his father's casket and sees that it is empty, prompting him to scream and attract the attention of the silver sphere. Jody destroys it with a shotgun. Suddenly, Reggie appears and explains that he rescued Sally and several other girls. The three then open the mysterious door the fortune teller's daughter opened earlier. Inside, they find oil drum-like canisters with more dwarfed re-animated corpses inside them. Mike accidentally falls through a portal and catches a brief glimpse of a red, hot planet where the dwarves are toiling as slaves. He is quickly snatched back to Earth by Jody, after which he deduces that the Tall Man must come from the red planet and that the corpses are shortened so they can withstand the increased gravity and temperatures. 

The trio is suddenly split up by a power outage. Reggie remains in the dwarf storage room alone, and places his hands on the portal, mirroring an earlier scene when he stopped a tuning fork from vibrating. This causes the portal to become a powerful vacuum that Reggie narrowly escapes. It also stuns the Lady in Lavender, revealed to be a shape-shifted Tall Man, and saves Jody from being stabbed. However, in the chaos, Reggie stumbles upon the Lady in Lavender's body, and she kills him. Jody and Mike flee, and the mausoleum vanishes. The brothers devise a plan to lure the Tall Man into a local deserted mine shaft and trap him inside. Mike once again controls his fear and succeeds in the plan, after which he suddenly wakes up in his bed. Reggie, still alive, tells Mike that much of what he experienced was a nightmare, which has been happening frequently since Jody died in a car crash. Mike appears to remember this and believe it. Reggie tells Mike that he will take care of him as Jody did, and that they should go on a road trip together. When Mike enters his bedroom to pack, he is shocked to see the Tall Man is waiting for him. Hands crash through the glass of his bedroom mirror, pulling Mike into a dark void.

==Cast==
* [[Angus Scrimm]] as [[Tall Man (Phantasm)|The Tall Man]]:
: After being intimidated by Scrimm on the set of a previous film, Coscarelli decided that Scrimm would make a great villain.&lt;ref name=sphere&gt;{{cite news|last=Savlov|first=Marc|title=Sphere of Influence|url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/screens/2000-03-31/76665/|accessdate=August 9, 2013|newspaper=[[Austin Chronicle]]|date=March 31, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Initially, Scrimm had little input into the character, but he made more of a contribution as Coscarelli began to trust his instincts.  Scrimm was outfitted in lifts and a suit too small for him in order to make him seem even taller and skinnier.  Coscarelli says of Scrimm, "I really didn't have any idea that he would take it to the level that he did. ... I could see it was going to be a very powerful character."&lt;ref name=birthday/&gt;
* [[A. Michael Baldwin]] as Mike Pearson:
: After the deaths of his parents, Mike tries to convince his brother and Reggie that a local mortician called the Tall Man is responsible for their deaths.  Coscarelli attributes the enduring popularity of the film to young audiences who respond to Mike's adventures.&lt;ref name=birthday&gt;{{cite news|title=Happy Birthday, Tall Man! 'Phantasm' Turns 30|url=http://herocomplex.latimes.com/uncategorized/phantasm/|first=Gina|last=McIntyre|accessdate=August 10, 2013|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=October 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After they worked together in a prior film, Coscarelli wrote a film in which Baldwin could star.{{sfn|Baldassarre|1999|p=51}}
* Bill Thornbury as Jody Pearson:
: Jody is Mike's older brother.  After their parents die, Jody becomes Mike's guardian, but Jody confides in his friends that he's uncomfortable with the responsibility.
* [[Reggie Bannister]] as [[Reggie (Phantasm)|Reggie]]:
: Don Coscarelli based the character of Reggie on his friend Reggie Bannister, for whom the role was written; they then twisted the character into new directions.&lt;ref name=ch&gt;{{cite web|last=Yapp|first=Nate|title=Reggie Bannister ("Phantasm") Interview|url=http://classic-horror.com/newsreel/reggie_bannister_phantasm_interview|work=classic-horror.com|accessdate=October 11, 2013|date=November 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Reggie was designed to be an everyman,&lt;ref name=ch/&gt; a loyal friend,&lt;ref name=icon/&gt; and the comic relief.{{sfn|Hennessey|McCarty|2004|p=79}}
* Kathy Lester as Lady in Lavender:
:The Tall Man appears in the form of the Lady in Lavender,{{sfn|Newman|2011|p=278}} which he uses to seduce and kill Tommy, Jody's friend.  Laura Mann appears as Kathy Lester's double, credited as Double Lavender.

The cast includes Bill Cone as Tommy, Mary Ellen Shaw as the fortune-teller, and Terrie Kalbus as the fortune-teller's granddaughter.

==Analysis==
Film scholar [[John Kenneth Muir]] interprets the film as being about mourning and death.{{sfn|Muir|2002|pages=611–613}} Many of the film's fans are young boys, aged 10–13. According to Angus Scrimm, the film "gives expression to all their insecurities and fears".  Scrimm states that the theme of loss and how, by fantasizing about death, the young protagonist deals with the deaths in his family drives the story.&lt;ref name=birthday/&gt;  Coscarelli identifies it as a "predominately male story" that young teens respond to.&lt;ref name=sphere/&gt;  Scrimm explains the popularity of the film as fans responding to themes of death,&lt;ref name=sphere/&gt; and the Tall Man himself represents death.&lt;ref name=birthday/&gt;  Muir describes the Tall Man as embodying childhood fears of adults and states that the Tall Man wins in the end because dreams are the only place where death can be defeated.{{sfn|Muir|2002|pages=611–613}}  American views of death are another theme:
{{quote|I had a compunction to try to do something in the horror genre and I started thinking about how our culture handles death; it’s different than in other societies. We have this central figure of a mortician. He dresses in dark clothing, he lurks behind doors, they do procedures on the bodies we don't know about. The whole embalming thing, if you ever do any research on it, is pretty freaky. It all culminates in this grand funerary service production. It's strange stuff. It just seemed like it would be a great area in which to make a film.|Don Coscarelli|''Los Angeles Times'' interview&lt;ref name=birthday/&gt;}}

Dreams and surrealism are also an important part of ''Phantasm''.  Marc Savlov of the ''[[Austin Chronicle]]'' compares ''Phantasm'' to the works of [[Alejandro Jodorowsky]] and [[Luis Buñuel]] in terms of weirdness.  Savlov describes the film as existentialist horror and "a truly bizarre mix of outlandish horror, cheapo gore, and psychological mindgames that purposefully blur the line between waking and dreaming."&lt;ref name=sphere/&gt;  Gina McIntyre of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' describes the film as surreal, creepy, and idiosyncratic.&lt;ref name=birthday/&gt;  Muir writes that ''Phantasm'' "purposely inhabits the half-understood sphere of dreams" and takes place in the imagination of a disturbed boy.{{sfn|Muir|2002|pages=611–613}}

After seeing the audience reaction to jump scares in ''[[Kenny and Company]]'', writer-director Don Coscarelli decided to do a horror film as his next project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Yapp|first=Nate|title=Reggie Bannister ("Phantasm") Interview|url=http://classic-horror.com/newsreel/reggie_bannister_phantasm_interview|work=Classic-Horror.com|accessdate=August 10, 2013|date=November 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His previous films had not performed well, and he heard that horror films were always successful; branching into horror allowed him to combine his childhood love of the genre with better business prospects.&lt;ref name=fortean&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sutton|first=David|title=Don Coscarelli|journal=[[Fortean Times]]|year=2006|url=http://www.forteantimes.com/features/interviews/116/don_coscarelli.html|accessdate=August 11, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105114832/http://www.forteantimes.com/features/interviews/116/don_coscarelli.html|archivedate=November 5, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original idea was inspired by ''[[Something Wicked This Way Comes (novel)|Something Wicked This Way Comes]]'' by [[Ray Bradbury]].  Coscarelli had initially sought to adapt the story to film, but the license had already been sold.&lt;ref name=fearnet&gt;{{cite web|last=McCabe|first=Joseph|title=Don Coscarelli Talks Phantasm and Bubba|url=http://www.fearnet.com/news/review/don-coscarelli-talks-phantasm-and-bubba|work=[[Fearnet]]|accessdate=August 10, 2013|date=April 9, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The theme of a young boy's difficulty convincing adults of his fears was influenced by ''[[Invaders from Mars (1953 film)|Invaders from Mars]]'' (1953).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Piepenburg|first=Erik|title=Just So You Know: ‘John Dies at the End’|url=http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/01/24/just-so-you-know-john-dies-at-the-end/?_r=0|accessdate=August 11, 2013|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=January 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Dario Argento]]'s ''[[Suspiria]]'' (1977) and its lack of explanations was another influence on Coscarelli.&lt;ref name=fortean/&gt;  The soundtrack was influenced by [[Goblin (band)|Goblin]] and [[Mike Oldfield]].  The synthesizers were so primitive that it was difficult to repeat sounds.&lt;ref name=ign&gt;{{cite web|last=Gilchrist|first=Todd|title=Exclusive Interview: Don Coscarelli|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2007/04/10/exclusive-interview-don-coscarelli|work=[[IGN]]|accessdate=August 11, 2013|date=April 10, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When writing the film's conclusion, Coscarelli intentionally wanted to shock audiences and "send people out of the theater with a bang."&lt;ref name=ten&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1982&amp;dat=19840226&amp;id=jYpGAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=ei4NAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1573,2637606|title='Cult' films Spell Success for Movie-Maker|last=Duvoli|first=John|work=The Evening News|location=Newburgh, New York|date=February 26, 1984|accessdate=March 5, 2014|via=Google News}} {{free access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Filming===
There were no accountants on the set, but Coscarelli estimates the budget at $300,000.&lt;ref name=birthday/&gt;  Funding for the film came in part from Coscarelli's father,&lt;ref name=fangoria&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pace|first=Dave|title=Q&amp;A: Don Coscarelli on "JOHN DIES" &amp; Independent Filmmaking for 30+ Years|journal=[[Fangoria]]|date=April 11, 2013|url=http://www.fangoria.com/new/qa-don-coscarelli-on-john-dies-independent-filmmaking-for-30-years/|accessdate=August 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; who was credited as the film's producer;&lt;ref name=afi/&gt; additional funding came from doctors and lawyers.&lt;ref name=birthday/&gt; His mother designed some of the special effects,&lt;ref name=fangoria/&gt; costumes, and make-up.&lt;ref name=birthday/&gt;  The cast and crew were composed mainly of friends and aspiring professionals.  Due to their inexperience, they did not realize that firing blanks could be dangerous; Coscarelli's jacket caught fire from a shotgun blank.&lt;ref name=birthday/&gt; Casting was based on previous films that Coscarelli directed, and he created roles for those actors.&lt;ref name=fearnet/&gt;  Because he could not afford to hire an editor or cameraman, Coscarelli did these duties himself.{{sfn|Baldassarre|1999|p=50}}

Filming was done weekends and sometimes lasted for 20 hours over the course of more than a year.&lt;ref name=sphere/&gt; Reggie Bannister described the production as "flying by the seat of our pants." The actors would be called to perform their scenes and picked up as soon as they were available.&lt;ref name=birthday/&gt;&lt;ref name=icon&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iconvsicon.com/2009/07/28/30-years-of-phantasm-reggie-bannister-interview-200/|title=30 Years of Phantasm|last=Johnson|first=Steve|work=Icon vs Icon|date=July 28, 2009|accessdate=August 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bannister did many of his own stunts.&lt;ref name=icon/&gt;  Though set in [[Oregon]], shooting took place primarily in the San Fernando Valley in [[Chatsworth, California]].&lt;ref name=birthday/&gt;  The script changed often during production, and Bannister says that he never saw a completed copy of it; instead, they worked scene-by-scene and used improvisation.&lt;ref name=sphere/&gt;&lt;ref name=icon/&gt;  The script was characterized by Coscarelli as "barely linear".&lt;ref name=fortean/&gt;  While it contained the basic concepts of the completed film, the script was unfocused and rewritten during filming.&lt;ref name=fortean/&gt;  The spheres came from one of Coscarelli's nightmares, but the original idea did not involve drilling.&lt;ref name=sphere/&gt;  Will Greene, an elderly metal-worker, fashioned the iconic spheres, but he never got to see the finished film, as he died before the film was released.&lt;ref name=ten/&gt;  The black 1971 [[Plymouth Barracuda]] was used because Coscarelli had known someone in high school who drove one; he realized that he could get his hands on one by using it in the film.&lt;ref name=birthday/&gt;

===Post-production===
Post-production took another six to eight months.&lt;ref name=birthday/&gt;  The first test screening was poorly received due to the film's length; Coscarelli says that he erred in adding too much character development, which needed to be edited out.&lt;ref name=sphere/&gt;  ''Phantasm''{{'}}s fractured dream logic was due in part to the extensive editing.&lt;ref name=ign/&gt;  During shooting, they did not have a clear idea of the ending.&lt;ref name=fortean/&gt;  Several endings were filmed, and one of them was re-used in ''[[Phantasm IV: Oblivion]]''.  Coscarelli attributed the freedom to choose from among these endings to his independent financing.&lt;ref name=birthday/&gt;

==Release==
To solicit outside opinions, Coscarelli paid an audience to watch an early cut of the film.  Although Coscarelli called the result "a disaster", he was encouraged by the audience's reactions to the film.&lt;ref name=ten/&gt; The financial success of ''[[Halloween (1978 film)|Halloween]]'' released the prior year convinced vice-president of marketing at [[Embassy Pictures|AVCO Embassy Pictures]], Robert Rehme, to purchase ''Phantasm'' for distribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nowell|first1=Richard|title=The Ambitions of Most Independent Filmmakers: Indie Production, the Majors, and Friday the 13th (1980)|journal=Journal of Film and Video|date=2011|volume=63|issue=2|page=32|doi=10.5406/jfilmvideo.63.2.0028|url=https://doi.org/10.5406/jfilmvideo.63.2.0028}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original theatrical release was March 28th, 1979.

In late 2015, Coscarelli showed a work-in-progress [[4K resolution]] restoration of ''Phantasm'' (called ''Phantasm: Remastered'') at the [[Butt-Numb-A-Thon]] film festival.  It was supervised by Coscarelli at [[Bad Robot Productions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2015/12/14/phantasm-jj-abrams-star-wars|title=Phantasm director talks J.J.

J. Abrams]], a fan of the series, requested a screening of the film.  Coscarelli told him that he did not have a high quality print, but Abrams volunteered the use of his technicians for a restoration.  The completed restoration premiered at [[SXSW]] in March 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.screamhorrormag.com/17161-2/|title=Don Coscarelli Muses Over PHANTASM Remastered Ahead of SXSW Screening|last=Gorman|first=Howard|work=Scream Magazine|date=March 14, 2016|accessdate=April 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Phantasm: Remastered'' was released in limited theaters on September 24, 2016&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://thecolonialtheatre.com/programs/phantasm-remastered/|title=The Colonial Theatre - Phantasm: Remastered|accessdate=July 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and was released on Blu-ray on December 6, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blu-ray.com/movies/Phantasm-Blu-ray/78092/|title=Phantasm: Remastered - Blu-ray|accessdate=July 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical response===

Charles Champlin of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' deemed the film "a smooth and terrifically impressive technical achievement, a sort of ''jeu de spook'' with all manner of eerie and shocking special effects."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|title=A Screamer in 'Phantasm'|author=Champlin, Charles|pages=11–{{url|https://www.newspapers.com/clip/23115351/the_los_angeles_times/|12}}|date=March 28, 1979|via=Newspapers.com|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/23115101/the_los_angeles_times/}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a mostly negative review, critic [[Roger Ebert]] described the film as "a labor of love, if not a terrifically skillful one."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ebert|first=Roger|title=Phantasm|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/phantasm|work=Chicago Sun-Times|accessdate=August 25, 2018|date=March 28, 1979|authorlink=Roger Ebert}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trevor Johnston of ''[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]]'' called the film "a surprisingly shambolic affair whose moments of genuine invention stand out amid the prevailing incompetence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Johnston|first=Trevor|title=Phantasm|journal=[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]]|url=http://www.timeout.com/london/film/phantasm|accessdate=August 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Dave Kehr]] of the ''[[Chicago Reader]]'' described it as "spotty" and "effective here and there", though he praised Coscarelli's raw ability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kehr|first=Dave|title=Phantasm|journal=[[Chicago Reader]]|url=http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/phantasm/Film?oid=1071451|accessdate=August 25, 2018|authorlink=Dave Kehr}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Vincent Canby]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' compared it to a ghost story told by a bright, imaginative 8-year-old; he concluded that it is "thoroughly silly and endearing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Canby|first=Vincent|title=Phantasm|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9507E7DC1539E732A25752C0A9609C946890D6CF&amp;partner=Rotten%20Tomatoes|accessdate=August 25, 2018|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=June 1, 1979|authorlink=Vincent Canby}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' gave it a positive review that highlighted the use of both horror and humor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Review: Phantasm|journal=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|url=https://variety.com/1978/film/reviews/phantasm-1200424446/|accessdate=August 11, 2013|author=''Variety'' Staff}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tim Pulleine (''[[Monthly Film Bulletin]]'') described the film as a "dilapidated z-movie" with "singularly unconvincing apparitions and contraptions" and that the film did not have "anything resembling a coherent plot in the course of all the fumblingly juvenile malarkey".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Monthly Film Bulletin]]|title=Phantasm|volume=46|issue=540|page=182|year=1979|publisher=[[British Film Institute]]|location=London|last=Pulleine|first=Tim|ISSN=0027-0407}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name of ''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens]]'' villain [[Captain Phasma]] was chosen as a reference to ''Phantasm''.

''USA Today'' quoted Jovanka Vuckovic, editor in chief of ''[[Rue Morgue (magazine)|Rue Morgue]]'', as stating that ''[[Supernatural (U.S. TV series)|Supernatural]]'', ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street]]'' (1984), and ''[[One Dark Night]]'' (1983) were all influenced by ''Phantasm''.&lt;ref name=usatoday/&gt; ''Folklore, Horror Stories, and the Slender Man'' identifies the Tall Man as an influence on the internet-based character [[Slender Man]].{{sfn|Chess|Newsom|2014|pages=58–59}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1971">'''Pierre-César Abeille''' (1674 - after 1733) was a French composer. Born in the [[Salon-de-Provence]] of southern France, he was baptized on 24 February 1674. He was the son of Jean Abeille, a royal notary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Grove|first=George|title=The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians|year=1980|publisher=Macmillan Publishers|location=London|isbn=9781561591749|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1699 to 1700, Abeille was ''maître de chapelle'' of the primate's [[Church of St. Trophime, Arles]].  When he was succeeded by Fançois Pétouille, he was ''vicaire de choeur'' and ''maitre de musique'' at the royal parish church of [[Saint-Germain l'Auxerrois]] in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Raugel|first=Félix|authorlink= Félix Raugel |title=Les maîtres français de l'orgue aux XVIIe et XVIIIe siècles|year=1961|publisher=Musicales de la Schola Cantorum et de la Procure Générale de Musique|location=Paris|oclc=642932728|pages=99–106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Music ==
Abeille's best known work is the two volume set ''Psalms of David'', dedicated to [[Françoise d'Aubigné, Marquise de Maintenon|Madame de Maintenon]]. It is a set of 150 psalms that alternate among [[Air (music)|airs]], [[duet]]s, and [[ritornello]]s. The pieces are generally performed in a concertante style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Grove|first=George|title=The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians|year=1980|publisher=Macmillan Publishers|location=London|isbn=9781561591749|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pig slaughter is an activity performed to obtain pig meat ([[pork]]). It regularly happens as part of traditional and [[intensive pig farming]].

Pigs are slaughtered at different ages. Generally they can be divided into [[Piglet (animal)|piglets]], which are 1.5 to 3 months old; the [[fattening pig]]s, intended for pork and [[bacon]], which are 4 months to one year old; and finally the older pigs, such as sows (female pigs) and [[boar]]s (un[[castrated]] male pigs). The meat obtained from piglets is subdivided into more meaty or more fatty, determined by the thickness of bacon. Male hogs are usually castrated a month before slaughter. Their meat quality is determined on the mass of halves and the thickness of bacon on the back.

Transport of pigs to slaughter and all the other procedures and circumstances leading up to the actual act of stunning and killing the pig are in modern times carefully arranged in order to avoid excessive suffering of animals, which both has a humane rationale as well as helping provide for a higher quality of meat.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hsa.org.uk/Information/Slaughter/Pig%20Slaughter.html Humane Slaughter of Pigs], by the [[Humane Slaughter Association]], United Kingdom&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="zdolec-2006"/&gt;

Typically, pigs are first rendered unconscious using one of the following means: stunning using [[electric current]] applied with [[electrode]]s, or stunning using [[captive bolt pistol]], and inhalation of [[CO2|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], then in some cases a .22 pistol/rifle which is shot directly into the brain. They are then hoisted on a rail, after which they are [[exsanguinate]]d, usually via the [[carotid artery]] and the [[jugular vein]]. After the [[blood]] is gone, the [[Cadaver|carcass]] is drenched in hot water in a device called a [[pig scalder]] which helps in the removal of hair, which is subsequently completed by using scissor-like devices and then if necessary with a torch. However, in many countries across the world, rendering the pig unconscious is not standard practice and exsanguination occurs whilst the pigs are fully conscious.

The pig is then [[Disembowelment|eviscerated]], the head is usually removed, and the body is cut into two halves. The remaining halves are washed to remove any remaining blood, [[bacteria]] or remains of bone, and then cooled down in order to help with the process of cutting and deboning.

In the [[European Union]], the Regulation (EC) of the [[European Parliament]] and of the [[European Council|Council]] No. 852/2004, 853/2004 and 854/2004 cover various aspects of hygiene of foodstuffs that includes pig slaughter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/food_safety/veterinary_checks_and_food_hygiene/f84001_en.htm Food hygiene&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/food_safety/veterinary_checks_and_food_hygiene/f84002_en.htm Hygiene for food of animal origin&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/food_safety/veterinary_checks_and_food_hygiene/f84003_en.htm Official controls on products of animal origin intended for human consumption&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==European tradition==
[[File:Sausage making-H-1.jpg|thumb|uright|The process of making a sausage in a traditional Hungarian household]]

Pig slaughter is a tradition known in numerous [[Europe]]an countries and regions: [[Albania]](Non-Muslim Parts), [[Bulgaria]] (''колене на прасе, kolene na prase''), [[Croatia]] (''kolinje''), [[Serbia]] (''see below''), [[Hungary]] (''disznóvágás''), [[Poland]] (''świniobicie''), the [[Czech Republic]] (''zabijačka''), [[Slovakia]] (''zabíjačka''), [[Greece]], [[Italy]] (''maialata''), [[Moldova]], [[Romania]] (''tăiatul porcului, Ignat''), [[Russia]], [[Slovenia]] (''koline''), [[Portugal]] (''matança''), [[Spain]] (''matanza''), [[Ukraine]], [[Corsica]] and others.

Family [[hog pen]]s have also existed in the [[United States]] on small family farms, but in recent decades has become rare.

===Traditional autumn activity===
The slaughter traditionally takes place in the autumn and early winter, and the timing has several practical considerations.&lt;ref name="karolyi-salajpal-lukovic-2010"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;!-- all three authors from Faculty of Agriculture, [[University of Zagreb]] --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; It can start as soon as it gets cold, as the cold is required as a natural method of preserving the relatively large quantities of meat during the [[butcher]]ing.&lt;ref name="gradiste-zkg"/&gt; Yet, because people often do the work in the open, it is preferable that the temperatures aren't too much below freezing during this time, hence the slaughter rarely extends into winter.
Also, slaughter activities typically need to produce results before the [[Christmas]] season, to provide for the festive cuisine.

In the past, this was also the only time of the year when people could afford to eat larger amounts of [[meat]].&lt;ref name="gradiste-zkg"/&gt; In modern times, almost any family in Europe that is so inclined can afford to slaughter, yet there is also an abundance of pre-processed meat in the shops, so the traditional method of slaughtering is becoming more and more of a [[folk custom]] rather than a necessity.

The slaughter requires numerous preparations, including troughs,&lt;ref name="gradiste-zkg"/&gt; large quantities of boiling water, large wooden [[barrel]]s for storing meat, [[cooking pot|pots]], sharp knives,&lt;ref name="gradiste-zkg"/&gt; and in modern times also artificial intestines (hoses for various sausages).

Historically, [[butcher]]ing was a trade passed from father to son.&lt;ref name="gradiste-zkg"/&gt; Today the initial slaughter is normally performed by a professional butcher.&lt;ref name="karolyi-salajpal-lukovic-2010"/&gt; After that, the meat is butchered by laymen, and the process is accompanied by various local [[ritual]]s.&lt;ref name="gradiste-zkg"/&gt;

===Act of slaughter and the butchering of carcass===
[[Image:Zabijacka.jpg|thumb|right|Stirring of blood in order to prevent its coagulation. Collected blood will be further used. ([[Moravia]], [[Czech Republic]]).]]

Traditionally, the pig is slaughtered with a knife and then put in a wooden or a metal [[Watering trough|trough]] and showered with hot water to remove the hair. The pig is then removed from the trough and any remaining hair is removed with a knife or a [[razor]],&lt;ref name="gradiste-zkg"/&gt; and then it is again washed with hot water.

Today, the animal is rendered unconscious by electrical or carbon dioxide stunning and then immediately bled by cutting the throat.&lt;ref name="karolyi-salajpal-lukovic-2010"/&gt; For quality reasons, mechanical means of stunning such as a [[captive bolt pistol]] are not recommended although in some abattoirs they do use it and the pigs are stunned at 80 volts &lt;ref name="karolyi-salajpal-lukovic-2010"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hsa.org.uk/Information/Slaughter/Pig%20Slaughter.html Humane Slaughter of Pigs], by the [[Humane Slaughter Association]], England&lt;/ref&gt;

Then, the pig's [[intestine]]s are removed. The evisceration process is when the sexual, digestive and excretory organs are removed. These days, the pig can also be obtained as a half (Croatian: ''polovica'' or ''polutka''), without intestines or blood.

In modern times, because of the danger of [[Trichinosis]], people in some countries are required to have critical parts of the fresh meat tested by a [[veterinarian]] before any further contact with potentially infected meat.&lt;ref name="masic-2004"&gt;{{cite journal

Very sharp knives and a [[cleaver (knife)|cleaver]] are required for butchering. The carcass is cut into [[ham]]s, shoulders, [[bacon]] sides, [[pork belly]]s, [[ham hock]]s, loins, pork chops, and other cuts of lesser importance.

===Processing of animal parts===
After it is cut into pieces, the meat from the animal is then processed further into edible products.

The buttocks are salted and pressed in order to eventually produce [[ham]]. The ribcage meat is salted and smoked in order to get [[bacon]].&lt;ref name="karolyi-salajpal-lukovic-2010"/&gt; Salt is rubbed thoroughly into each piece of meat and all surfaces are covered. Some formulas also include lots of black pepper.
The bulk of the meat is cut and ground to produce various [[sausage]]s, which are traditionally wrapped into the intestines of various sizes.&lt;ref name="karolyi-salajpal-lukovic-2010"/&gt;
[[File:Schwein-Ganz.svg|thumb|Schematic representation of the main pork cuts.]]
The bulk of the fat is cut into small pieces. Some of it is fried to produce [[Pork rind|cracklings]]. 
[[Lard]] is made by [[Kitchen rendering|rendering]] - heating fragments of fat in a large iron pot over a fire until it is reduced to simmering grease which congeals when cooled.&lt;ref name="karolyi-salajpal-lukovic-2010"/&gt; Lard is then stored in lard tins with tin covers. The typical tins in the US are five gallons.
In some areas (mainly [[Eastern Europe|Eastern]] and [[Central Europe]], but also [[Italy]] and [[United Kingdom]]), the fat is salted as is to produce [[salo (food)|salo]], [[lardo]] or [[salt pork]].

The intestines are stripped by drawing them through a clenched fist. They are then washed, cut into short pieces, and fried to make [[chitlin]]s.

The various "leftovers" are put into various forms of [[headcheese]] jelly, etc. Most parts of the pig are used in this traditional process, even parts of the skin that would normally be thrown away are preserved to be cooked with beans.

The [[smoke house]] is essential for the preservation and long term storage of hams, shoulders, bacon sides, and pork bellies. The meat is hung on racks and hooks in the smokehouse; and later smoked. Fragrant hardwood, such as [[hickory]], [[beech]], or [[cherry]] is allowed to smolder slowly in a pit below the hanging meat. This gives added flavor and color to the meat as well as serving to dry cure the pork.

==Country-specific statistics and customs==
[[File:Medieval pig slaughter.jpg|thumb|Illustration of medieval pig stunning, from ''The Medieval Cookbook'']]

===Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Slovenia and Serbia===
{{Refimprove section|date=August 2007}}

The traditional pig slaughter in [[Croatia]] as well as the neighboring [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], Slovenia and [[Serbia]] is a widespread practice that involves pig slaughtering, processing, and butchery of pig meat, and is observed by rural families, usually in late autumn. The tradition is variously called "koline", ''kolinje'', ''prašćina'', ''svinjokolj'', ''svinjokolja'' or ''svinjokolje'' or ''posjek''. The names literally mean "pig-slaughtering" (''svinja''=pig, n., ''klanje''=slaughter, n.). It is a custom specific to the parts of the countries in the [[Pannonian plain]].&lt;ref name="gradiste-zkg"&gt;{{cite web

After WWII, in [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], a state holiday fell on November 29, with that and next day being non-working, so most slaughters were held on that occasion. In Croatian region Dalmatia, the pig-slaughter are traditionally done in period between Christmas and New Year's Eve.

The entire duration of the slaughter can be as long as three days. Because people were traditionally stocking up on supplies before winter, it became customary to slaughter more than one pig, which increased the amount of time necessary for the meat to be processed. Some families visit their relatives (often grandparents) and friends at that time of the year, in order to help. Also, little [[mechanization]] is used, with meat being cut manually. Any grinding is done with relatively small manually operated, mechanical grinding machines.

The traditionally produced ham (''šunka''), bacon (''slanina''), the sausages (''kobasica'') such as [[blood sausage]] (''krvavica'') and [[kulen]] are well known as delicacies.&lt;ref name="gradiste-zkg"/&gt; Some of them, notably kulen, are classified under the laws of [[protected designation of origin]]. The non-meat products such as cracklings (''čvarci'') or [[švargl]] and [[hladetina]] are also respected as parts of traditional cuisine.

To complement the activities, [[rakija]] or [[wine]] is drunk by participants during the butchering.&lt;ref name="gradiste-zkg"/&gt;

The pig [[liver]] is customarily roasted the same day of the slaughter.
&lt;!--
The meat can then be salted and stored in a cellar, to be taken out after ten days, when the [[blood]] is squeezed out. The meat is then stored again and left until May of the next year.
* who does this? --&gt;

Men and women were traditionally assigned different jobs during the slaughter. It was commonly the men who were doing the actual slaughter, the larger part of butchering, and the grinding of meat. Because the society is traditionally [[patriarchal]], the women were in charge of a relatively menial tasks, such as waiting and cooking for the whole crew throughout the event, keeping the environment clean (washing and scrubbing), as well as the emptying the pigs' bowels in order to make them suitable for holding sausage meat.&lt;ref name="gradiste-zkg"/&gt;

The standard of hygiene long recommended by veterinarians has included various requirements for the people, tools and space used in the process.
All people involved in the slaughter and butchering must be healthy, dressed with a hat, apron and boots, and clean hands. The tools (knives, axes, saws etc.) are sharpened, cleaned and disinfected before use, and they should be kept in a clean place throughout the process, preferably in a clean toolbox around the butcher's belt. The location of the killing needs to be a clean concrete surface with a sewer canal, meaning that the space can be easily cleaned. The trough used should have a zinced surface which is easy to clean and disinfect; the wooden troughs absorb water and microorganisms which makes them unsuitable.

The [[Croatian Ministry of Agriculture]] has published rules on sanitation requirements for animal slaughter since 1992, animal waste disposal rules since 2003, while regulations from 2005 also cover animal welfare in relation to slaughter.&lt;ref name="zdolec-2006"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;!-- author is from the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, [[University of Zagreb]] --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; These rules track the relevant European Union regulation.&lt;ref name="zdolec-2006"/&gt;

Croatian [[animal rights]] activists regard the traditional slaughtering process as cruel and outdated. They also question if European animal welfare and sanitary standards are really met, as there is not sufficient supervision available during the country-wide slaughter. Farmers are barely educated about the new standards they have to apply to, as this information is solely available through a website from the Ministry of Agriculture.

The most vocal Croatian animal rights organization "Animal Friends Croatia" advocates banning the entire practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.prijatelji-zivotinja.hr/index.en.php?id=1581/ | title = Home Slaughter | publisher = Animal Friends Croatia | accessdate = 23 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the process of [[Accession of Croatia to the European Union|Croatia's entry into the EU]], there were widespread fears that new legislation would make ''svinjokolja'' as such illegal, forcing all pig slaughter to be conducted in controlled, inspected facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

[[File:Jitrnice studena.jpg|thumb|200px|left|''Jitrnice'', traditional part of the Czech national cuisine]]
In some countries traditional pig slaughter is a special event.&lt;ref name="turek"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pozitivni-noviny.cz/cz/clanek-2009010112|title=Zabíjačkové karminy a rafinézní erotiky|last=Turek |first=Milan |date=31 January 2009|publisher=Pozitivní noviny|language=Czech|accessdate=26 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pig slaughter in the [[Czech Republic]] has usually taken place during the winter months, when low temperatures make it easier to store fresh meat and meat products. Preparations for the event extended over a number of days and involved a variety of ceremonies.&lt;ref name="turek"/&gt; The event itself was accompanied by the making of traditional dishes such as ''[[Liverwurst|jitrnice]]'', ''[[tlačenka]]'' and ''[[pork rind|škvarky]]''. After the slaughter, the young men of the village would visit neighbours and relatives bringing gifts of meat and fresh soup. The pig slaughter ended with what was called a ''karmina'', a special celebration held in the household where the slaughter had taken place. Invited guests, sometimes dressed in masks, would join in the feasting and drinking.&lt;ref name="turek"/&gt; In the past, the traditional pig slaughters usually ended on [[Ash Wednesday]].&lt;ref name="turek"/&gt;

Traditional pig slaughters (''[[:cs:Zabijačka|zabijačka]]'') still (as of 2011) take place in public at [[Mardi Gras]] celebrations in many Czech towns and villages.&lt;ref name=denik1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.denik.cz/z_domova/zabijacky-tradice-ktera-zanika20100129.html|title=Zabijačky: česká tradice, která zaniká|last=Vaňková|first=Zuzana|date=30 January 2010|publisher=deník.cz|language=Czech|accessdate=23 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="radio"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radio.cz/en/section/magazine/magazine-6|title=Magazine |last=Lazarová|first=Daniela|date=28 February 2004|publisher=[[Czech Radio]]|accessdate=23 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However the domestic pig slaughter is a disappearing tradition.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} During the [[History of Czechoslovakia (1948–1989)|communist era]] it was cheaper and people preferred to raise and slaughter pigs at home. Many [[Bohemia proper|Bohemian]] and [[Moravia]]n villagers worked in the [[Collective farming#Czechoslovakia (1948-90)|JZD]] (collective farms) and it was easier for them to obtain the foodstuffs needed to fatten a pig.&lt;ref name=denik1/&gt; Since then pig raising and slaughtering has become less common in Czech villages and towns. It is also subject to regulation by the [[European Union]]. In 2009 [[Jan Březina]], Czech politician and [[Member of the European Parliament|MEP]], commented that: "The discovery that in [[Romania]] the animals are not paralyzed before slaughter provoked a hysterical reaction on the part of the European institutions. The older member states have begun calling for more stringent European regulation. "&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.denik.cz/ze_sveta/brusel-koriguje-zabijacky-delat-odbornik20090626.html|title=Brusel koriguje zabíjačky, musí je dělat odborník|last=Lapčík|first=Michael|date=26 June 2009|publisher=deník.cz|language=Czech|accessdate=24 May 2011}} (''„Zjištění, že se v Rumunsku zvířata před porážkou neomračují, vyvolalo na půdě evropských institucí hysterickou reakci.

The traditional domestic pig slaughter was a favourite theme of the renowned Czech painter [[Josef Lada]].&lt;ref name="turek"/&gt; In the play ''[[The Pig, or Václav Havel's Hunt for a Pig|Prase]]'' (The Pig, 1987), [[Václav Havel]] tries to buy a pig for a ''zabijačka'' by local villagers, with difficulty because as a [[dissident]] he is considered politically suspect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radio.cz/en/section/news/news-2010-03-20|title=Brno theatre stages previously unknown Havel play|last= Willoughby|first=Ian|date=20 March 2010|publisher=[[Czech Radio]]|accessdate=23 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kultura.idnes.cz/brnenska-husa-na-provazku-uvede-havlovo-prase-prazaci-ho-uvidi-v-arse-12l-/divadlo.aspx?c=A100323_171823_divadlo_tt|title=Brněnská Husa na provázku uvede Havlovo Prase, Pražáci ho uvidí v Arše |date=24 March 2010|publisher=[[Mladá fronta DNES]]|language=Czech|accessdate=23 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1968, Jiří Šebánek, a founder of the ''[[Jára Cimrman]] Theatre'', wrote the play ''The Pig Slaughter at Home.

=== Slovakia ===
In [[Slovakia]], the pig slaughter (''zabíjačka'', ''zakáľačka'', ''bravčovina'', ''svinský kar'', ''karmina'') was an essential part of the winter traditions from early medieval times.&lt;ref name="konsulat"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slowakei-info.ch/sl/kultur/themen/kn-110110-2.html|title=Zabíjačka bola v minulosti spoločenská udalosť|date=7 January 2011|publisher=Generalkonsulat Slowakische Republik in Zürich|language=Slovak|accessdate=26 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pig slaughter was considered an important event in village society and an opportunity for families to get together. According to Katarína Nádaská of the Department of Ethnology and Cultural Anthropology at [[Comenius University in Bratislava|Comenius University]] in [[Bratislava]], the traditional period for pig slaughters usually started on 21 December, the feast day of [[Thomas the Apostle|St. Thomas]]. There was a special magical importance attached to the date and farmers believed that the meat of a pig slaughtered on St. Thomas Day would last longer.&lt;ref name="konsulat"/&gt; A second traditional pig slaughtering period began around [[Mardi Gras]].

In the past there were a number of traditional customs associated with the pig slaughter. After the slaughter, the girls of the household would collect the bones and scatter them around the yard for [[love magic]] purposes. They believed that when a dog snatched the first bone, the girl who had thrown the bone would be the first one to marry.&lt;ref name="konsulat"/&gt;

{{Signs of death}}

'''Rigor mortis''' ([[Latin]]: ''rigor'' "stiffness", ''mortis'' "of death") or '''postmortem rigidity''', the third [[Stages of death|stage of death]], is one of the recognizable [[Signs of death#Signs|signs of death]], caused by chemical changes in the [[muscle]]s post mortem, which cause the limbs of the [[Cadaver|corpse]] to stiffen.&lt;ref name="saladin"&gt;Saladin, K.S. 2010. Anatomy &amp; Physiology:  6th edition. McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt; In humans, rigor mortis can occur as soon as 4 hours post mortem.

== Physiology ==

After death, respiration in an organism ceases, depleting the source of oxygen used in the making of '''[[adenosine triphosphate]]''' (ATP). ATP is required to cause separation of the [[Myofibril|actin-myosin]] [[Sliding filament theory|cross-bridges]] during relaxation of muscle.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Hall, John E., and Arthur C. Guyton. Guyton and Hall Textbook of Medical Physiology. Philadelphia, PA: Saunders/Elsevier, 2011. MD Consult. Web. 26 Jan. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; When oxygen is no longer present, the body may continue to produce ATP via anaerobic [[glycolysis]]. When the body's [[glycogen]] is depleted, the ATP concentration diminishes, and the body enters rigor mortis because it is unable to break those bridges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fremery|first1=Donald|title=Biochemistry of Chicken Muscle as Related to Rigor Mortis and Tenderization|journal=Journal of Food Science|date=3 February 1959|volume=25|issue=1|pages=73–87|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2621.1960.tb17938.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, calcium enters the [[cytosol]] after death. Calcium is released into the cytosol due to the deterioration of the [[sarcoplasmic reticulum]]. Also, the breakdown of the sarcolemma causes additional calcium to enter the cytosol. The calcium activates the formation of actin-myosin cross-bridging. Once calcium is introduced into the cytosol, it binds to the troponin of thin filaments, which causes the troponin-tropomyosin complex to change shape and allow the myosin heads to bind to the active sites of actin proteins.&lt;ref name="saladin"/&gt; In rigor mortis [[myosin]] heads continue binding with the active sites of actin proteins via [[adenosine diphosphate]] (ADP), and the muscle is unable to relax until further enzyme activity degrades the complex.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Normal relaxation would occur by replacing ADP with ATP, which would destabilize the myosin-actin bond and break the cross-bridge.&lt;ref name="saladin"/&gt; However, as ATP is absent, there must be a breakdown of muscle [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]] by [[enzyme]]s (endogenous or bacterial) during [[decomposition]]. As part of the process of decomposition, the myosin heads are degraded by the enzymes, allowing the muscle contraction to release and the body to relax.&lt;ref name="about.com"&gt;[http://chemistry.about.com/cs/biochemistry/a/aa0 About.com]{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ask a Scientist"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newton.dep.anl.gov/askasci/zoo00/zoo00248.htm|title=Classroom Resources - Argonne National Laboratory|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Decomposition of the myofilaments occurs 48 to 60 hours after the peak of rigor mortis, which occurs approximately 13 hours after death.&lt;ref name="saladin"/&gt;
&lt;!-- Placeholder for diagram of Sarcomere including Actin and Myosin --&gt;

== Physical changes ==
At the time of death, a condition called "primary flaccidity" occurs. Following this, the muscles stiffen in rigor mortis. All muscles in the body are affected. Starting between two and six hours following death, rigor mortis begins with the eyelids, neck, and jaw. The sequence may be due to different [[lactic acid]] levels among different muscles, which is directly related to the difference in [[glycogen]] levels and different types of muscle fibers.

Rigor mortis then spreads to the other muscles, including the internal organs, within the next four to six hours. The onset of rigor mortis is affected by the individual's age, sex, physical condition, and muscular build. Rigor mortis may not be perceivable in many infant and child corpses due to their smaller muscle mass.&lt;ref&gt;"Rigor Mortis and Other Postmortem Changes - Burial, Body, Life, Cause, Time, Person, Human, Putrefaction." Encyclopedia of Death and Dying. 2011. Web. 4 December 2011. &lt;http://www.deathreference.com/Py-Se/Rigor-Mortis-and-Other-Postmortem-Changes.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications in meat industry ==
Rigor mortis is very important in meat technology. The onset of rigor mortis and its resolution partially determine the tenderness of [[meat]]. If the post-slaughter meat is immediately chilled to 15&amp;nbsp;°C (59&amp;nbsp;°F), a phenomenon known as cold shortening occurs, whereby the muscle sarcomeres shrink to a third of their original length. &lt;!-- the muscles don't actually shrink, just change shape This will lead to the loss of water from the meat along with many of the [[vitamins]], [[minerals]], and [[water-soluble]] proteins. The loss of water makes the meat hard and interferes with the manufacturing of several meat products like [[cutlet]] and [[sausage]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}--&gt;

Cold shortening is caused by the release of stored [[calcium]] ions from the [[sarcoplasmic reticulum]] of muscle fibers, in response to the cold stimulus. The calcium ions trigger powerful muscle contraction aided by ATP molecules. To prevent cold shortening, a process known as electrical stimulation is carried out, especially in beef carcasses, immediately after [[Animal slaughter|slaughter]] and [[skinning]]. In this process, the [[Cadaver|carcass]] is stimulated with [[alternating current]], causing it to contract and relax, which depletes the ATP reserve from the carcass and prevents cold shortening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M3wmO3ynTUwC&amp;pg=PA13|title=New Zealand Journal of Agricultural Research|publisher=The Royal Society of New Zealand|author=The Royal Society of New Zealand|page=13|year=1976}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Application in forensic pathology ==
The degree of rigor mortis may be used in [[forensic pathology]], to determine the approximate time of death. A dead body holds its position as rigor mortis sets in. If the body is moved after death, but before rigor mortis begins, forensic techniques such as [[livor mortis]] can be applied.  If the position in which a body is found does not match the location where it is found (for example, if it is flat on its back with one arm sticking straight up), that could mean someone moved it. &lt;!--Rigor mortis is also useful because it's like an alarm clock set to go off and cease to ring in an understood span of happiness. poor analogy--&gt;

Several factors also affect the progression of rigor mortis, and investigators take these into account when estimating the time of death. One such factor is the ambient temperature. In warm environments, the onset and pace of rigor mortis are sped up by providing a conducive environment for the metabolic processes that cause decay. &lt;!--muscles are essentially sterile unless punctured or the blood is contaminated peri mortem--&gt; Low temperatures, however, slow them down. Therefore, for a person who dies outside in frozen conditions rigor mortis may last several days more than normal, so investigators may have to abandon it as a tool for determining time of death.&lt;ref&gt;Peress, Robin.

'''Samiilo Bohdanovych-Zarudny''' ({{lang-uk|Самійло Богданович-Зарудний}}; {{lang-pl|Samuel Zarudny Bogdanowicz}}) was a [[Cossack]] diplomat, noble and general judge of the [[Zaporozhian Host]], who defected to [[Bohdan Khmelnytsky]]'s side at [[Korsun-Shevchenkivskyi]] in 1648.

Bohdanovych-Zarudny played key roles in the [[Treaty of Pereyaslav]] (Pereiaslav Treaty) of 1654 which began when he conducted negotiations in [[Warsaw]] in 1650, and subsequently headed the Kozak delegations to Moscow (1652 and again in 1654) and [[Turkey]] (1653). In 1657 Bohdanovych-Zarudny traveled to [[Transylvania]] to once again initiate negotiations towards another treaty. This eventually led to the 1658 signing, with [[Poland]], of the [[Treaty of Hadiach]] (Hadiache).

Following the decline of [[Ivan Vyhovsky]], Bohdanovych-Zarudny joined [[Yurii Khmelnytsky]] where he participated in drafting the Treaty of Slobodyshche.

In 1664, Bohdanovych-Zarudny fought, alongside the [[Poland|Polish]], against [[Ivan Briukhovetsky]] who eventually signed the [[Moscow Articles of 1665]], effectively placing [[Ukraine]] under the direct rule of the [[Tsar]], and thereby ending Ukraine's independence and autonomy.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17263">'''Sperm sorting''' is a means of choosing what type of [[sperm cell]] is to [[Fertilisation|fertilize]] the [[egg cell]]. Several conventional techniques of  [[density gradient centrifugation|centrifugation]] or [[swim-up]]. Newly applied methods such as flow cytometry expand the possibilities of sperm sorting and new techniques of sperm sorting are being developed.

It can be used to sort out sperm that are most healthy, as well as for determination of more specific traits, such as [[sex selection]] in which spermatozoa are separated into [[X chromosome|X-]] (female) and [[Y chromosome|Y-]] (male) chromosome bearing populations based on their difference in DNA content. The resultant 'sex-sorted' spermatozoa are then able to be used in conjunction with other assisted reproductive technologies such as [[artificial insemination]] or [[in-vitro fertilization]] (IVF) to produce offspring of the desired sex - in farming animals but also in human medical practice.

== Methods ==

=== Conventional techniques ===
Several methods have been used to sort sperm before the advent of flow cytometry. [[Density gradient centrifugation]] (in a continuous or discontinuous gradient) can concentrate semen samples with low concentration of sperm, using the density of sperm as a measure of their quality.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ribeiro|first=Sofia C.|last2=Sartorius|first2=Gideon|last3=Pletscher|first3=Flurina|last4=Geyter|first4=Maria de|last5=Zhang|first5=Hong|last6=Geyter|first6=Christian de|title=Isolation of spermatozoa with low levels of fragmented DNA with the use of flow cytometry and sorting|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0015028213006407|journal=Fertility and Sterility|volume=100|issue=3|pages=686–694.e4|doi=10.1016/j.fertnstert.2013.05.030}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, so-called [[swim-up]] techniques apply a centrifugation step and then sperm is allowed to swim up into a medium, thus enriching a subpopulation of motile sperm. However, use of sperm centrifugation is detrimental to the sperm viability and elicits production of reactive oxygen species.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rappa|first=Kari L.|last2=Rodriguez|first2=Harold F.|last3=Hakkarainen|first3=Gloria C.|last4=Anchan|first4=Raymond M.|last5=Mutter|first5=George L.|last6=Asghar|first6=Waseem|date=2016-09-01|title=Sperm processing for advanced reproductive technologies: Where are we today?|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0734975016300076|journal=Biotechnology Advances|volume=34|issue=5|pages=578–587|doi=10.1016/j.biotechadv.2016.01.007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conventional techniques are routinely used in assisted reproductive technology.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Paasch|first=Uwe|last2=Grunewald|first2=Sonja|last3=Glander|first3=Hans-Juergen|date=2007-01-01|title=Sperm selection in assisted reproductive techniques|journal=Society of Reproduction and Fertility Supplement|volume=65|pages=515–525|issn=1747-3403|pmid=17644989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Flow cytometry ===
[[Flow cytometry]] is another method used to sort sperm and adaptations of this technique opens new opportunities in sperm sorting. However, because flow cytometry-based sperm sorting often uses fluorescent dyes that often stain DNA, the safety of this technique in human reproductive medicine is a matter of scientific discussion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Caroppo|first=Ettore|title=Sperm sorting for selection of healthy sperm: is it safe and useful?|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0015028213007000|journal=Fertility and Sterility|volume=100|issue=3|pages=695–696|doi=10.1016/j.fertnstert.2013.06.006|pmid=23809504}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ribeiro|first=Sofia|last2=Sartorius|first2=Gideon|last3=Geyter|first3=Christian de|title=Sorting of spermatozoa with flow cytometry|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0015028213007395|journal=Fertility and Sterility|volume=100|issue=3|doi=10.1016/j.fertnstert.2013.06.039|page=e15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, flow cytometry is the only currently used technique able to determine the sex of future progeny by measuring DNA content of individual sperm cells. It evaluates if they contain the larger [[X chromosome]] (giving rise to a female offspring) or smaller [[Y chromosome]] (leading to male progeny). It then allows separation of X and Y sperm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Johnson|first=L. A.|last2=Welch|first2=G. R.|last3=Rens|first3=W.|date=1999-01-01|title=The Beltsville sperm sexing technology: high-speed sperm sorting gives improved sperm output for in vitro fertilization and AI|journal=Journal of Animal Science|volume=77 Suppl 2|pages=213–220|issn=0021-8812|pmid=15526798|doi=10.2527/1999.77suppl_2213x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The so-called ''[[Beltsfield Sperm Sexing Technology]]'' was developed by USDA in conjunction with Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories, relying on the DNA difference between the X- and Y- chromosomes.&lt;ref&gt;Garner DL, Seidel GE. History of commercializing sexed semen for cattle. Theriogenology 2008;69: 886-895.&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to flow cytometric sorting, semen is labeled with a fluorescent dye called [[Hoechst 33342]] which binds to the DNA of each spermatozoon. As the X chromosome is larger (i.e. has more DNA) than the Y chromosome, the "female" (X-chromosome bearing) spermatozoa will absorb a greater amount of dye than its male (Y-chromosome bearing) counterpart.  As a consequence, when exposed to UV light during flow cytometry, X spermatozoa fluoresce brighter than Y- spermatozoa.  As the spermatozoa pass through the flow cytometer in single file, each spermatozoon is encased by a single droplet of fluid and assigned an electric charge corresponding to its chromosome status (e.g. X-positive charge, Y-negative charge).  The stream of X- and Y- droplets is then separated by means of electrostatic deflection and collected into separate collection tubes for subsequent processing.&lt;ref&gt;Seidel GE, Jr., Garner DL. Current status of sexing mammalian spermatozoa. Reproduction 2002;124: 733-743.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another cytometric technique used in sperm sorting is [[magnetic-activated cell sorting]] (MACS) which is routinely applied in assisted reproduction hospitals to sort out sperm with fragmented DNA. This is achieved using [[Antibody|antibodies]] to surface markers of programmed cell death ([[apoptosis]]) such as [[annexin V]], coupled with magnetic beads. Following the binding of these antibodies, spermatozoa which undergo apoptosis are sorted by applying [[magnetic field]] to the sperm suspension.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gil|first=Monica|last2=Sar-Shalom|first2=Valerie|last3=Sivira|first3=Yolisid Melendez|last4=Carreras|first4=Ramon|last5=Checa|first5=Miguel Angel|date=2013-03-07|title=Sperm selection using magnetic activated cell sorting (MACS) in assisted reproduction: a systematic review and meta-analysis|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10815-013-9962-8|journal=Journal of Assisted Reproduction and Genetics|language=en|volume=30|issue=4|pages=479–485|doi=10.1007/s10815-013-9962-8|issn=1058-0468|pmc=3644127}}&lt;/ref&gt; MACS obviates the need for fluorescent DNA binding molecules.

=== Other techniques ===
[[DNA damage]] in sperm cells may be detected by using [[Raman spectroscopy]].&lt;ref name="MIT"&gt;[http://www.technologyreview.com/biomedicine/21982/page1/ Ranking sperm cells could improve the odds of in vitro fertilization.] By Courtney Humphries. TechnologyReview. Wednesday, January 21, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; It is not specific enough to detect individual traits, however.&lt;ref name="MIT" /&gt; The sperm cells having least DNA damage may subsequently be injected into the egg cell by [[intracytoplasmic sperm injection]] (ICSI).&lt;ref name="MIT" /&gt; Many other methods for sperm sorting have been proposed or are currently tested.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Applications ==
Sperm undergoes a process of [[natural selection]] when millions of sperm enter vagina but only few reach the egg cell and then only one is usually allowed to [[Fertilisation|fertilize]] it. The sperm is selected not only by its highest [[Sperm motility|motility]] but also by other factors such as [[DNA integrity]], production of [[reactive oxygen species]] and [[Cell viability|viability]]. This selection is largely circumvented in case of [[in-vitro fertilization]] which leads to higher incidence of [[Congenital disorder|birth defects]] associated with [[Assisted reproductive technology|assisted reproductive techniques]]. Egg cells are often fertilized by sperm which would have low chance of fertilizing it in natural conditions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Sperm sorting could thus be used to decrease risks associated with assisted reproduction. Additionally, there is ongoing debate about using sperm sorting for choosing the child's sex.

=== For general health ===
Conventional methods of sperm sorting have been widely used to assess quality of sperm before subsequent [[artificial insemination]] or [[in-vitro fertilization]]. It has been verified that sperm sorted using these techniques is of superior quality than unsorted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Aitken|first=R. John|last2=Clarkson|first2=Jane S.|date=1988-11-12|title=Significance of Reactive Oxygen Species and Antioxidants in Defining the Efficacy of Sperm Preparation Techniques|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/j.1939-4640.1988.tb01067.x/abstract|journal=Journal of Andrology|language=en|volume=9|issue=6|pages=367–376|doi=10.1002/j.1939-4640.1988.tb01067.x|issn=1939-4640}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=De Geyter|first=C.|last2=Bals-Pratsch|first2=M.|last3=Doeren|first3=M.|last4=Yeung|first4=C.

New flow-cytometry based techniques such as [[YO-PRO]] staining can discriminate [[Apoptosis|apoptotic]] and dead spermatozoa from the viable ones.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; For example, [[annexin V]] staining followed by [[Magnetic-activated cell sorting|MACS]] can significantly improve pregnancy rates in couples with previous assisted reproduction failure.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== For sex selection ===

==== In farming ====
Sperm sorting by flow cytometry is an established technique in veterinary practice, and in the dairy industry most female cows are artificially inseminated with sorted semen to increase the number of female [[Calf|calves]] (using sperm sorting is less common in other species of farm animals, however artificial insemination is common).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rath|first=D.|last2=Barcikowski|first2=S.|last3=de Graaf|first3=S.|last4=Garrels|first4=W.|last5=Grossfeld|first5=R.|last6=Klein|first6=S.|last7=Knabe|first7=W.|last8=Knorr|first8=C.|last9=Kues|first9=W.|date=2013-01-01|title=Sex selection of sperm in farm animals: status report and developmental prospects|journal=Reproduction (Cambridge, England)|volume=145|issue=1|pages=R15–30|doi=10.1530/REP-12-0151|issn=1741-7899|pmid=23148085}}&lt;/ref&gt; Artificial insemination of farm animals with sorted sperm is recognized by the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO) as a promising way of increasing efficiency of agriculture needed to produce enough food for the growing human population. Utilizing artificial insemination with sorted sperm is seen as a way to create an optimal ratio of male and female calves to increase dairy [[milk production]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== In humans ====
{{Further information|Sex selection#Ethical concerns}}Choosing the sex of children might help prevent [[Sex-linked inheritance|sex-associated heritable diseases]] such as [[Duchenne muscular dystrophy|Duchene muscular dystrophy]] or [[haemophilia]] in families with a history of these diseases. On the other hand, sperm sorting in humans raises the ethical concerns implicit to the idea of [[sex selection]]. If applied large-scale, it has a potential to elicit a [[Human sex ratio|sex-ratio imbalance]]. It could also have implications on gender equality if parents consistently choose to have a boy as their first-born (first-borns were shown to be more likely to succeed in life).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kalfoglou|first=A.L.|last2=Kammersell|first2=M.|last3=Philpott|first3=S.|last4=Dahl|first4=E.|title=Ethical arguments for and against sperm sorting for non-medical sex selection: a review|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S147264831200692X|journal=Reproductive BioMedicine Online|volume=26|issue=3|pages=231–239|doi=10.1016/j.rbmo.2012.11.007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the early to mid-1980s, [[Glenn Spaulding]] was the first to sort viable whole human and animal spermatozoa using a flow cytometer, and utilized the sorted motile rabbit sperm for artificial insemination. Subsequently, the first patent application disclosing the method to sort "two viable subpopulations enriched for x- or y- sperm" was filed in April 1987 as US Application Serial Number 35,986 and later became part of US Patent 5,021,244; and the patent included the discovery of [[haploid]] expression (sex-associated membrane proteins, or SAM proteins) and the development of monoclonal antibodies to those proteins.&lt;ref&gt;US Patent 5,021,244, column 9, Sorting Sperm; http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;d=PALL&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.htm&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;s1=5021244.PN.&amp;OS=PN/5021244&amp;RS=PN/5021244&lt;/ref&gt; Additional applications and methods were added, including antibodies, from 1987 through 1997.&lt;ref&gt;US Patent 5,021,244; 5,346,990; 5,369,012; 5,439,362; 5,496,722; 5,648,468; 5,660,997; PCT/US1989/002069&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of the patent filing, both [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories]] and the [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]] were only sorting fixed sperm nuclei,&lt;ref&gt;L.

There is no country in the world which explicitly permits sex selection for non-medical purposes. There were 31 countries in 2009 which allowed sex selection in case of sex-linked disease risk or other medical purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://geneticsandsociety.org/downloads/200904_sex_selection_memo.pdf|title=Countries with laws or policies on sex selection|last=Darnovsky|first=Marcy|date=2009|website=|publisher=geneticsandsociety.org|access-date=2016-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the US, for humans, the application of sperm sorting in sex selection is tightly regulated by the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration|FDA]]. After the establishment of the MicroSort technique, it was offered to parents as a part of a [[clinical trial]]. The procedure was made available to a limited number of participants each month, in addition to fulfilling certain criteria, such as having a disease with [[sex linkage]] or having at least one child (for family balancing).&lt;ref name="institute"&gt;[http://www.microsort.net/ Genetics &amp; IVF Institute: MicroSort Clinical Trial]&lt;/ref&gt; There are currently MicroSort laboratories and collaborating physicians in several countries (some for general purposes, some only offering service in case of genetic disease risks associated with one sex).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.microsort.com/?page_id=319|title=About Us {{!}} MicroSort International|last=ThemeFuse|website=www.microsort.com|access-date=2016-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While highly accurate, sperm sorting by flow cytometry will not produce two completely separate populations. That is to say, there will always be some "male" sperm among the "female" sperm and vice versa. The exact percentage purity of each population is dependent on the species being sorted and the 'gates' which the operator places around the total population visible to the machine. In general, the larger the DNA difference between the X and Y chromosome of a species, the easier it is to produce a highly pure population. In sheep and cattle, purities for each sex will usually remain above 90% depending on 'gating', while for humans these may be reduced to 90% and 70% for "female" and "male" spermatozoa, respectively.&lt;ref name="institute" /&gt;

{{Short description|Choral work by Edward Elgar about the journey of a soul}}
'''''The Dream of Gerontius''''', [[Opus number|Op]]. 38, is a work for voices and orchestra in two parts composed by [[Edward Elgar]] in 1900, to text from [[The Dream of Gerontius (poem)|the poem]] by [[John Henry Newman]]. It relates the journey of a pious man's soul from his deathbed to his judgment before God and settling into [[Purgatory]]. Elgar disapproved of the use of the term "[[oratorio]]" for the work (and the term occurs nowhere in the score), though his wishes are not always followed. The piece is widely regarded as Elgar's finest choral work, and some consider it his masterpiece.

The work was composed for the [[Birmingham Triennial Music Festival|Birmingham Music Festival]] of 1900; the first performance took place on 3 October 1900, in [[Birmingham Town Hall]]. It was badly performed at the premiere, but later performances in Germany revealed its stature. In the first decade after its premiere, the [[Roman Catholic]] dogma in Newman's poem caused difficulties in getting the work performed in [[Anglican]] cathedrals, and a revised text was used for performances at the [[Three Choirs Festival]] until 1910.

==History==
[[File:Edward Elgar.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Elgar, around the time of composition]]
Elgar was not the first composer to think about setting [[John Henry Newman]]'s poem "[[The Dream of Gerontius (poem)|The Dream of Gerontius]]". [[Antonín Dvořák|Dvořák]] had considered it fifteen years earlier, and had discussions with Newman, before abandoning the idea.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, p. 291&lt;/ref&gt; Elgar knew the poem well; he had owned a copy since at least 1885, and in 1889 he was given another copy as a wedding present. This copy contained handwritten copies of extensive notes that had been made by [[Charles George Gordon|General Gordon]], and Elgar is known to have thought of the text in musical terms for several years.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, p. 290&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the 1890s, Elgar had composed several large-scale works for the regular festivals that were a key part of Britain's musical life. In 1898, based on his growing reputation, he was asked to write a major work for the 1900 [[Birmingham Triennial Music Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;Moore, p. 256&lt;/ref&gt; He was unable to start work on the poem that he knew so well until the autumn of 1899, and did so only after first considering a different subject.&lt;ref name=m296&gt;Moore, p. 296&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:HansRichter1876.png|left|thumb|upright|Hans Richter conducted the premiere]]
Composition proceeded quickly. Elgar and [[August Jaeger]], his editor at the publisher [[Novello &amp; Co|Novello]], exchanged frequent, sometimes daily, letters,&lt;ref&gt;Moore, pp. 302–316&lt;/ref&gt; which show how Jaeger helped in shaping the work, and in particular the climactic depiction of the moment of judgment.&lt;ref name=m322&gt;Moore, p. 322&lt;/ref&gt; By the time Elgar had completed the work and Novello had printed it, there were only three months to the premiere. The Birmingham chorus, all amateurs, struggled to master Elgar's complex, demanding and somewhat revolutionary work. Matters were made worse by the sudden death of the chorus master [[Charles Swinnerton Heap]] and his replacement by [[William Stockley (musician)|William Stockley]], an elderly musician who found the music beyond him.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, p. 325&lt;/ref&gt; The conductor of the premiere, [[Hans Richter (conductor)|Hans Richter]], received a copy of the full score only on the eve of the first orchestral rehearsal.&lt;ref name=mt/&gt; The soloists at the Birmingham Festival on 3 October 1900 were [[Marie Brema]], [[Edward Lloyd (tenor)|Edward Lloyd]] and [[Harry Plunket Greene]].&lt;ref&gt;Moore, p. 331&lt;/ref&gt; The first performance was, famously, a near disaster. The choir could not sing the music adequately, and two of the three soloists were in poor voice.&lt;ref&gt;Reed, p. 60&lt;/ref&gt; Elgar was deeply upset at the debacle, telling Jaeger, "I have allowed my heart to open once – it is now shut against every religious feeling &amp; every soft, gentle impulse for ever."&lt;ref name=gram/&gt; However, many of the critics could see past the imperfect realisation and the work became established in Britain&lt;ref name=grove/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moore, p. 357&lt;/ref&gt; once it had had its first London performance in 1903, at the [[Roman Catholic]] [[Westminster Cathedral]].&lt;ref name=dnb&gt;[[Michael Kennedy (music critic)|Kennedy, Michael]], [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/32988 "Elgar, Sir Edward William, baronet (1857–1934)".] ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004, accessed 22 April 2010 {{subscription}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after the premiere, the German conductor and chorus master [[Julius Buths]] made a German translation of the text and arranged a successful performance in [[Düsseldorf]] on 19&amp;nbsp;December 1901. Elgar was present, and he wrote "It completely bore out my idea of the work: the chorus was very fine".&lt;ref&gt;Moore, p. 362&lt;/ref&gt; Buths presented it in Düsseldorf again on 19 May 1902 in conjunction with the [[Lower Rhenish Music Festival]].&lt;ref name=reed61&gt;Reed, p. 61&lt;/ref&gt; The soloists included [[Muriel Foster]], and Elgar was again in the audience, being called to the stage twenty times to receive the audience's applause.&lt;ref name=m368/&gt; This was the performance that finally convinced Elgar for the first time that he had written a truly satisfying work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musicweb-international.com/hooey/foster.htm |title=Elgar's Blessed Charmer – Muriel Foster |publisher=Music Web International |accessdate=2 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Buths's festival co-director [[Richard Strauss]] was impressed enough by what he heard that at a post-concert banquet he said: "I drink to the success and welfare of the first English progressive musician, Meister Elgar".&lt;ref name=reed61/&gt; This greatly pleased Elgar,&lt;ref name=m368&gt;Moore, p. 368&lt;/ref&gt; who considered Strauss to be "the greatest genius of the age".&lt;ref&gt;Liner notes to ''Salome'', Decca Records, 2006, oclc 70277106&lt;/ref&gt;

The strong Roman Catholicism of the work gave rise to objections in some influential British quarters; some [[Church of England|Anglican]] clerics insisted that for performances in English cathedrals Elgar should modify the text to tone down the Roman Catholic references. There was no Anglican objection to Newman's words in general: [[Arthur Sullivan]]'s setting of his "[[Lead, Kindly Light]]", for example, was sung at [[Westminster Abbey]] in 1904.&lt;ref name="The Times 1904, p. 13"&gt;''The Times'', 13 February 1904, p. 13{{Full citation needed|date=October 2018}} &lt;/ref&gt; Disapproval was reserved for the doctrinal aspects of ''The Dream of Gerontius'' repugnant to Anglicans, such as Purgatory.&lt;ref&gt;"A Dean's Objections to ''The Dream of Gerontius''", ''The Manchester Guardian'', 17 November 1903. p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; Elgar was unable to resist the suggested [[bowdlerization|bowdlerisation]], and in the ten years after the premiere the work was given at the [[Three Choirs Festival]] with an expurgated text.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 11 September 1903 and 13 September 1905{{Full citation needed|date=October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Dean (Christianity)|Dean]] of [[Gloucester Cathedral|Gloucester]] refused admission to the work until 1910.&lt;ref&gt;McGuire, Charles Edward, [https://books.google.com/books?id=JDRN-arhD2wC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Elgar+Byron+Adams&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=7SzBtX0G8Z&amp;sig=tjM_q_cSKP4XXoSNRbp5n7qV64E&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=REHBTPTfH4yA4QaL2tmjDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CB8Q6AEwAw#v=snippet&amp;q=Newman&amp;f=false "Measure of a Man"], in ''Edward Elgar and his World'', ed. Byron Adams, Princeton University Press, 2007 p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, Geraint, "A Cathedral in Sound", ''[[Gramophone (magazine)|Gramophone]]'', September 2008, p. 50. The Gloucester performance in 1910 was described in ''[[The Manchester Guardian]]'' (5 September 1910, p. 7) as "given unmutilated for the first time in an Anglican cathedral".&lt;/ref&gt; This attitude lingered until the 1930s, when the Dean of [[Peterborough Cathedral|Peterborough]] banned the work from the cathedral.&lt;ref&gt;"Cathedral Ban on 'Gerontius'," ''The Manchester Guardian'', 19 October 1932, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; Elgar was also faced with many people's assumption that he would use the standard hymn tunes for the sections of the poem that had already been absorbed into Anglican hymn books: "Firmly I believe and truly", and "Praise to the Holiest in the Height".&lt;ref name="The Times 1904, p. 13"/&gt;

[[File:Gerontius-singers.jpg|thumb|right|Notable ''Gerontius'' soloists, [[Edward Lloyd (tenor)|Edward Lloyd]] and [[Marie Brema]], (top); [[Gervase Elwes]] and [[Elena Gerhardt]], (below)]]
''The Dream of Gerontius'' received its US premiere on 23 March 1903 at The Auditorium, Chicago, conducted by Harrison M. Wild. It was given in New York, conducted by [[Walter Damrosch]] three days later.&lt;ref name=hod&gt;Hodgkins, p. 187&lt;/ref&gt; It was performed in Sydney, in 1903.&lt;ref name=hod/&gt; The first performance in Vienna was in 1905;&lt;ref&gt;McColl, Sandra, "Gerontius in the City of Dreams: Newman, Elgar, and the Viennese Critics", ''International Review of the Aesthetics and Sociology of Music'', Vol. 32, No. 1 (Jun. 2001), pp. 47–64&lt;/ref&gt; the Paris premiere was in 1906;&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Musical Times]]'', April 1934, p. 318{{Full citation needed|date=October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by 1911 the work received its Canadian premiere in [[Toronto]] under the baton of the composer.

In the first decades after its composition leading performers of the tenor part included [[Gervase Elwes]] and [[John Coates (tenor)|John Coates]], and [[Louise Kirkby Lunn]], [[Elena Gerhardt]] and [[Julia Culp]] were admired as the Angel. Later singers associated with the work include Muriel Foster, [[Clara Butt]], [[Kathleen Ferrier]], and [[Janet Baker]] as the Angel, and [[Heddle Nash]], [[Steuart Wilson]], [[Tudor Davies]] and [[Richard Lewis (tenor)|Richard Lewis]] as Gerontius.&lt;ref name=gram&gt;Farach Colton, Andrew, "Vision of the Hereafter", ''Gramophone'', February 2003, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;

The work has come to be generally regarded as Elgar's finest choral composition. The ''[[Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]'' rates it as "one of his three or four finest works", and the authors of ''[[The Record Guide]]'', writing in 1956 when Elgar's music was comparatively neglected, said, "Anyone who doubts the fact of Elgar's genius should take the first opportunity of hearing ''The Dream of Gerontius'', which remains his masterpiece, as it is his largest and perhaps most deeply felt work."&lt;ref&gt;Sackville-West, p. 254&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'', [[Michael Kennedy (music critic)|Michael Kennedy]] writes, "[T]he work has become as popular with British choral societies as ''[[Messiah (Handel)|Messiah]]'' and ''[[Elijah (oratorio)|Elijah]]'', although its popularity overseas did not survive 1914. Many regard it as Elgar's masterpiece. ... It is unquestionably the greatest British work in the oratorio form, although Elgar was right in believing that it could not accurately be classified as oratorio or cantata."&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;

==Synopsis==
[[File:John Henry Newman by Sir John Everett Millais, 1st Bt.jpg|thumb|upright|[[John Henry Newman|Cardinal Newman]], author of the poem set by Elgar]]
Newman's poem tells the story of a soul's journey through death, and provides a meditation on the unseen world of [[Roman Catholic]] theology. Gerontius (a name derived from the Greek word ''geron'', "old man") is a devout [[Everyman]].&lt;ref name=grove/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The name "Gerontius" is not sung in the work, and there is no consensus on how it is pronounced. The Greek "geron" has a hard 'g'; but English words derived from it often have a soft 'g', as in "geriatriac"&lt;/ref&gt; Elgar's setting uses most of the text of the first part of the poem, which takes place on Earth, but omits many of the more meditative sections of the much longer, otherworldly second part, tightening the narrative flow.&lt;ref name=m296/&gt;

In the first part, we hear Gerontius as a dying man of faith, by turns fearful and hopeful, but always confident. A group of friends (also called "assistants" in the text) joins him in prayer and meditation. He passes in peace, and a priest, with the assistants, sends him on his way with a valediction. In the second part, Gerontius, now referred to as "The Soul", awakes in a place apparently without space or time, and becomes aware of the presence of his [[Guardian angel (spirit)|guardian angel]], who expresses joy at the culmination of his task (Newman conceived the Angel as male; Elgar gives the part to a female singer, but retains the references to the angel as male). After a long dialogue, they journey towards the [[Throne#Thrones and the Bible|judgment throne]].

They safely pass a group of [[Demon#War in Heaven|demons]], and encounter choirs of angels, eternally praising God for His grace and forgiveness. The Angel of the [[Gethsemane|Agony]] pleads with Jesus to spare the souls of the faithful. Finally Gerontius glimpses God and is judged in a single moment. The Guardian Angel lowers Gerontius into the soothing lake of Purgatory, with a final benediction and promise of a re-awakening to glory.

==Music==
===Forces===
The work calls for a large orchestra of typical [[Romantic music#Instrumentation and scale|late Romantic]] proportions, double chorus with semichorus, and usually three soloists. Gerontius is sung by a [[tenor]], and the Angel is a [[mezzo-soprano]]. The Priest's part is written for a [[baritone]], while the Angel of the Agony is more suited to a [[bass (voice type)|bass]]; as both parts are short they are usually sung by the same performer, although some performances assign different singers for the two parts.

The choir plays several roles: attendants and friends, demons, Angelicals (women only) and Angels, and souls in Purgatory. They are employed at different times as a single chorus in four parts, or as a double chorus in eight parts or [[antiphonal]]ly. The semichorus is used for music of a lighter texture; usually in performance they are composed of a few members of the main chorus; however, Elgar himself preferred to have the semi-chorus placed near the front of the stage.

The required instrumentation comprises two [[flute]]s (II doubling [[piccolo]]), two [[oboe]]s and [[cor anglais]], two [[clarinet]]s in B{{music|flat}} and A and [[bass clarinet]], two [[bassoon]]s and [[contrabassoon]], four [[French horn|horn]]s, three [[trumpet]]s, three [[trombone]]s, [[tuba]], [[timpani]] plus three [[Percussion instrument|percussion]] parts, [[harp]], [[organ (music)|organ]], and [[string orchestra|strings]]. Elgar called for an additional harp if possible, plus three additional trumpets (and any available percussionists) to reinforce the climax in Part II, just before Gerontius's vision of God.

===Form===
Each of the two parts is divided into distinct sections, but differs from the traditional oratorio in that the music continues without significant breaks. Elgar did not call the work an oratorio, and disapproved when other people used the term for it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/opr/t114/e2086 "Dream of Gerontius, The",] ''Oxford Companion to Music'', Oxford Music Online, accessed 22 October 2010 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; Part I is approximately 35 minutes long and Part II is approximately 60 minutes.

'''Part I:'''
# Prelude
# Jesu, Maria – I am near to death
# Rouse thee, my fainting soul
# Sanctus fortis, sanctus Deus
# Proficiscere, anima Christiana

'''Part II:'''
# I went to sleep
# It is a member of that family
# But hark! upon my sense comes a fierce hubbub
# I see not those false spirits
# But hark! a grand mysterious harmony
# Thy judgment now is near
# I go before my judge
# Softly and gently, dearly-ransomed soul

====Part I====
The work begins with an orchestral prelude, which presents the most important [[motif (music)|motifs]]. In a detailed analysis, Elgar's friend and editor [[August Jaeger]] identified and named these themes, in line with their functions in the work.&lt;ref&gt;Jaeger's analysis is summarised at Burton, James [http://www.choirs.org.uk/prognotes/Elgar%20Gerontius.htm "The Dream of Gerontius], British Choirs on the Net, accessed 22 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Gerontius sings a prayer, knowing that life is leaving him and giving voice to his fear, and asks for his friends to pray with him. For much of the soloist's music, Elgar writes in a style that switches between exactly [[musical notation|notated]], fully accompanied [[recitative]], and [[arioso]] phrases, lightly accompanied. The chorus adds devotional texts in four-part [[fugue|fugal]] writing. Gerontius's next utterance is a full-blown aria ''Sanctus fortis'', a long ''[[creed|credo]]'' that eventually returns to expressions of pain and fear. Again, in a mixture of conventional chorus and recitative, the friends intercede for him. Gerontius, at peace, submits, and the priest recites the blessing "Go forth upon thy journey, Christian soul!" (a translation of the [[litany]] ''Ordo Commendationis Animae''). This leads to a long chorus for the combined forces, ending Part I.&lt;ref name=notes&gt;Grove; Jenkins, Lyndon (1987), notes to EMI CD CMS 7 63185 2; and [[Jerrold Northrop Moore|Moore, Jerrold Northrop]] (1975), notes to Testament CD SBT 2025&lt;/ref&gt;

====Part II====
In a complete change of mood, Part II begins with a simple four-note phrase for the [[viola]]s which introduces a gentle, rocking theme for the strings. This section is in triple time, as is much of the second part. The Soul's music expresses wonder at its new surroundings, and when the Angel is heard, he expresses quiet exultation at the climax of his task. They converse in an extended duet, again combining recitative with pure sung sections. Increasingly busy music heralds the appearance of the demons: [[fallen angel]]s who express intense disdain of men, mere mortals by whom they were supplanted. Initially the men of the chorus sing short phrases in close harmony, but as their rage grows more intense the music shifts to a busy [[fugue]], punctuated by shouts of derisive laughter.&lt;ref name=notes/&gt;

Gerontius cannot see the demons, and asks if he will soon see his God. In a barely accompanied recitative that recalls the very opening of the work, the Angel warns him that the experience will be almost unbearable, and in veiled terms describes the [[stigmata]] of [[Francis of Assisi|St. Francis]]. Angels can be heard, offering praises over and over again. The intensity gradually grows, and eventually the full chorus gives voice to a setting of the section that begins with ''Praise to the Holiest in the Height''. After a brief orchestral passage, the Soul hears echoes from the friends he left behind on earth, still praying for him. He encounters the Angel of the Agony, whose intercession is set as an impassioned aria for bass. The Soul's Angel, knowing the long-awaited moment has come, sings an Alleluia.&lt;ref name=notes/&gt;

The Soul now goes before God and, in a huge orchestral outburst, is judged in an instant. At this point in the score, Elgar instructs "for one moment, must every instrument exert its fullest force." This was not originally in Elgar's design, but was inserted at the insistence of Jaeger, and remains as a testament to the positive musical influence of his critical friendship with Elgar. In an anguished aria, the Soul then pleads to be taken away. A chorus of souls sings the first lines of [[Psalms|Psalm]] 90 ("Lord, thou hast been our refuge") and, at last, Gerontius joins them in [[Purgatory]]. The final section combines the Angel, chorus, and semichorus in a prolonged song of farewell, and the work ends with overlapping Amens.&lt;ref name=notes/&gt;

===Dedication and superscription===
Elgar dedicated his work "A.M.D.G." (''[[Ad maiorem Dei gloriam]]'', "To the greater glory of God", the motto of the [[Society of Jesus]] or ''Jesuits''), following the practice of [[Johann Sebastian Bach]], who would dedicate his works "S.D.G." (''[[Soli Deo gloria]]'', "Glory to God alone").&lt;ref name=m317&gt;Moore, p. 317&lt;/ref&gt; Underneath this he wrote a line from [[Virgil]]: "Quae lucis miseris tam dira cupido?" together with [[John Florio|Florio]]'s English translation of [[Michel de Montaigne|Montaigne]]'s adaptation of Virgil's line: "Whence so dyre desire of Light on wretches grow?"&lt;ref name=m317/&gt;

At the end of the manuscript score, Elgar wrote this quotation from [[John Ruskin]]'s ''Sesame and Lilies'':
:This is the best of me; for the rest, I ate, and drank, and slept, loved and hated, like another: my life was as the vapour and is not; but ''this'' I saw and knew; this, if anything of mine, is worth your memory.&lt;ref name=grove&gt;McVeagh, Diana.

Richter signed the autograph copy of the score with the inscription: "Let drop the Chorus, let drop everybody—but let ''not'' drop the wings of your original genius."&lt;ref name=mt&gt;''[[The Musical Times]]'', 1 November 1900, p. 734{{Full citation needed|date=October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recordings==
{{Main|The Dream of Gerontius discography}}
[[Henry Wood]] made [[acoustic recording]]s of four extracts from ''The Dream of Gerontius'' as early as 1916, with [[Clara Butt]] as the Angel.&lt;ref name=gram/&gt; Edison Bell issued the work in 1924 with Elgar's tacit approval (despite his contract with HMV); acoustically recorded and abridged, it was swiftly rendered obsolete by the introduction of the electrical process, and soon after withdrawn. [[HMV]] issued live recorded excerpts from two public performances conducted by Elgar in 1927, with the soloists [[Margaret Balfour]], [[Steuart Wilson]], [[Tudor Davies]], [[Herbert Heyner]], and [[Horace Stevens]].&lt;ref&gt;"The Elgar Birthday Records", ''The Gramophone'', June 1927, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; Private recordings from radio broadcasts ("off-air" recordings) also exist in fragmentary form from the 1930s.

The first complete recording was made by [[EMI]] in 1945, conducted by [[Malcolm Sargent]] with his regular chorus and orchestra, the [[Huddersfield Choral Society]] and the [[Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra|Liverpool Philharmonic]]. The soloists were [[Heddle Nash]], [[Gladys Ripley]], [[Dennis Noble]] and [[Norman Walker (bass)|Norman Walker]]. This is the only recording to date that employs different singers for the Priest and the Angel of the Agony.&lt;ref name=gram/&gt; The first stereophonic recording was made by EMI in 1964, conducted by [[John Barbirolli]]. It has remained in the catalogues continuously since its first release, and is notable for [[Janet Baker]]'s singing as the Angel.&lt;ref name=gram/&gt; [[Benjamin Britten]]'s 1971 recording for [[Decca Records|Decca]] was noted for its fidelity to Elgar's score, showing, as the ''[[Gramophone (magazine)|Gramophone]]'' reviewer said, that "following the composer's instructions strengthens the music's dramatic impact".&lt;ref name=gram/&gt; Of the other dozen or so recordings on disc, most are directed by British conductors, with the exception of a 1960 recording in German under [[Hans Swarowsky]] and a Russian recording (sung in English by British forces) under [[Yevgeny Svetlanov]] performed 'live' in Moscow in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;Essex, Walter, [http://www.elgar.org/3gerontr.htm#disco "The Recorded Legacy"], The Elgar Society, accessed 22 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Another Russian conductor, [[Vladimir Ashkenazy]], performed the work with the Sydney Symphony Orchestra and its choral and vocal soloists in 2008 and this too has been released on CD.

The [[BBC]] [[BBC Radio 3|Radio 3]] feature "Building a Library" has presented comparative reviews of all available versions of ''The Dream of Gerontius'' on three occasions. Comparative reviews also appear in ''[[The Penguin Guide to Recorded Classical Music]]'', 2008, and ''Gramophone'', February 2003. The recordings recommended by all three are Sargent's 1945 EMI version and Barbirolli's 1964 EMI recording.&lt;ref name=gram /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio3/building/data2/rev_771_1808.shtml Building a Library]{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }} BBC Radio 3; [http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio3/building/data2/rev_771_1815.shtml Building a Library]{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}, BBC Radio 3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;March, pp. 438–40{{Full citation needed|date=October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Vincent Paul Abbott''' (March 11, 1964 – June 22, 2018), also known as '''Vinnie Paul''', was an American musician, songwriter and producer, best known for being the drummer and co-founder of the [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band [[Pantera]]. He was a member of [[Hellyeah]] for 12 years from 2006 until his death in 2018. He also co-founded the heavy metal band [[Damageplan]] in 2003 with his younger brother, [[Dimebag Darrell]].

==Early years==
Vincent Paul Abbott was born in [[Abilene, Texas]], on March 11, 1964. His parents were [[Jerry Abbott|Jerry]], a [[country music]] songwriter and producer, and Carolyn Abbott.

Abbott cited [[Peter Criss]],&lt;ref name="vicfirth1"/&gt; and [[Tommy Aldridge]] as his biggest influences as a drummer.

==Career==
===Pantera===
{{main|Pantera}}
Abbott formed the heavy metal band [[Pantera]] in 1981 with his brother [[Dimebag Darrell|Darrell Abbott]] and [[Terry Glaze]] on guitars, bassist Tommy D. Bradford, and vocalist Donnie Hart. Upon Hart's departure, Glaze assumed vocal duties. In the summer of 1982, Bradford left the band and was succeeded by [[Rex Brown]]. The band released three albums with that lineup.

Pantera recruited vocalist [[Phil Anselmo]] in 1987. By 1990, the band had been signed to Atco Records and released ''[[Cowboys from Hell]]'', which proved to be the band's turning point. Over the course of four more studio records, a live album and a [[The Best of Pantera: Far Beyond the Great Southern Cowboys' Vulgar Hits!|greatest hits compilation]], Anselmo and Pantera were nominated for four [[Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance|best metal performance Grammy]]s for the songs "[[I'm Broken]]", "[[Suicide Note Pt. I]]", "[[Cemetery Gates]]", and "[[Revolution Is My Name]]".

In 2001, Anselmo decided to put Pantera on hold because of [[degenerative disk disease|back pain]] while he toured and recorded with his side projects. Pantera's official disbandment took place in 2003 for several reasons, but mainly because of the ongoing dispute between Anselmo and the Abbott brothers, although Rex Brown remained neutral. In the years to follow, animosity would stir up between Abbott and Anselmo. Anselmo had publicly announced that he wished for Paul to forgive him and reform a friendship. However, Paul stated that he was not interested in speaking to Anselmo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://loudwire.com/pantera-rex-brown-vinnie-paul-wont-speak-to-me-or-philip-anselmo/|title=Pantera's Rex Brown: Vinnie Paul Won't Speak to Me or Philip Anselmo|website=Loudwire|date=August 4, 2017|accessdate=June 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Damageplan===
{{main article|Damageplan}}
After the breakup of Pantera, the Abbott brothers formed the heavy metal band [[Damageplan]] with former [[tattoo]] artist [[Bob Kakaha|Bob Zilla]] on bass and former [[Halford (band)|Halford]] guitarist [[Patrick Lachman|Pat Lachman]] on lead vocals. Damageplan recorded one album, ''[[New Found Power]]'', which was released on February 10, 2004.&lt;ref name="New Found Power"/&gt; The song "Ashes to Ashes", a collaboration with [[Alice in Chains]] guitarist/vocalist [[Jerry Cantrell]], was not completed in time to be featured on the album,&lt;ref name="showandtellonline.com"&gt;{{cite web|title=Pat Lachman interview |publisher=Show &amp; Tell |date=January 29, 2004 |url=http://www.showandtellonline.com/_damageplan/_interview_012904.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040302180615/http://showandtellonline.com/_damageplan/_interview_012904.html  |dead-url=yes |archive-date=March 2, 2004 |accessdate=June 25, 2018 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; but it was featured on the soundtrack to the 2004 film ''[[The Punisher (2004 film)|The Punisher]]'', and was a bonus track on the Japanese version of ''New Found Power''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/damageplan-s-collaboration-with-jerry-cantrell-confirmed-for-punisher-soundtrack/|title=DAMAGEPLAN's Collaboration With JERRY CANTRELL Confirmed For 'Punisher' Soundtrack |work=Blabbermouth|date=February 25, 2004|accessdate=June 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="showandtellonline.com"/&gt;

On December 8, 2004, while on tour to support Damageplan's album, Darrell Abbott was shot dead onstage by Nathan Gale at the [[Alrosa Villa]] in [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]], [[Ohio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1494653/dimebag-darrell-four-others-killed-in-ohio-concert-shooting/ |title=Dimebag Darrell, Four Others Killed In Ohio Concert Shooting |date=December 9, 2004 |website=MTV News |access-date=June 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Damageplan disbanded shortly thereafter. In a 2016 interview with [[Loudwire]], Vinnie Paul revealed that there are five unreleased Damageplan tracks that were meant for the band's second album that was set to be released in 2005, but that those tracks have no vocals, only him and Dimebag playing on them.&lt;ref name="unreleased Damageplan tracks"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2K-AS-2iAk&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=6m20s |title=Pantera / Hellyeah's Vinnie Paul - Wikipedia: Fact or Fiction? |date=November 30, 2016 |website=YouTube |access-date=June 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paul said that he didn't know what to do with those tracks, but he often thought about having some of Dimebag's favorite singers like [[Rob Halford]] of [[Judas Priest]] and [[Chris Cornell]] of [[Soundgarden]] to record vocals for the songs, but he didn't have time to do it because he was focused on his band Hellyeah.&lt;ref name="unreleased Damageplan tracks"/&gt;

===Later projects and Hellyeah===
{{Main article|Big Vin Records|Hellyeah}}

[[File:Vinnie Paul Uproar 2010.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Abbott performing with Hellyeah]]

After burying his brother, Abbott formed Big Vin Records in February 2006 and released ''[[Rebel Meets Rebel]]'' and a DVD, ''[[Big Vin Records|Dimevision, Volume 1]]''. Abbott along with [[Cristina Scabbia]], co-lead vocalist of [[Lacuna Coil]]) wrote a monthly question-and-answer column in ''[[Revolver (magazine)|Revolver]]''. Abbott maintained endorsement deals with [[ddrum]], [[Sabian (company)|Sabian]] cymbals, and [[Vic Firth]] drumsticks. He previously endorsed [[Tama drums|Tama]], [[Pearl drums]], and Remo drumheads and hardware.

In June 2006, after the death of his brother and an 18-month hiatus, Abott was not sure if he would return to music, but eventually joined in with the heavy metal [[Supergroup (music)|supergroup]] [[Hellyeah]], which also features vocalist [[Chad Gray]] and guitarist [[Greg Tribbett]] from [[Mudvayne]], guitarist [[Tom Maxwell (guitarist)|Tom Maxwell]] from [[Nothingface]], and bassist [[Bob Kakaha|Bob Zilla]] from [[Damageplan]], who was called on to replace original bassist [[Jerry Montano]]. In 2016, the group has released 5 studio albums, with the latest being [[Undeniable (Hellyeah album)|Unden!able]], released in June 2016. Unden!able was his last Hellyeah album.

For several years, Abbott had been trying to publish a [[cookbook]] called ''Drumming up an Appetite with Vinnie Paul''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://loudwire.com/hellyeah-vinnie-paul-cookbook/|title=Hellyeah Drummer Vinnie Paul Planning to Release Cookbook|website=Loudwire|accessdate=August 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8MeGU2-lg0|title=Vinnie Paul Talks Cookbooks, Strip Clubs, and Vehicle City Tacos|date=May 19, 2016|accessdate=August 26, 2017|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Collaborations====
In November 2008, he handpicked several of his most memorable drum parts to demonstrate in a promotional video for the drum company [[ddrum]]: "Use My Third Arm", "Primal Concrete Sledge", "13 Steps to Nowhere", "Domination", and "Becoming".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WH2_Yq0wm3I |title=Vinnie Paul on DDRUMS |publisher=YouTube |date=November 5, 2008 |accessdate=October 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2009, he started American Drummer Champions with the aide of friend and influence M. Ludowise, former Downset drummer.

In August 2013, Abbott was featured in a music video for [[Black Label Society]]'s cover of "[[Ain't No Sunshine]]", appearing alongside a horse-masked [[Zakk Wylde]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icEHA2DGFCk |title=Black Label Society - Ain't No Sunshine |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=July 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wylde and Abbott were well known to be close friends, with Wylde also having been particularly close with Abbott's brother Darrell before his death in 2004.

'''Vojin B. Rakic''' (born 1967 in [[Belgrade]], [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]]) is a [[philosopher]] and [[political scientist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arhiva.glas-javnosti.rs/arhiva/2001/12/19/srpski/D01121810.shtml|title=Vojin Rakić : Srpska duša i nove biotehnologije|date=19 December 2001|publisher=Glas Javnosti|language=Croatian|accessdate=17 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He publishes in [[English language|English]], but also in [[Serbian language|Serbian]]. He has a PhD in political science from [[Rutgers University]] in the [[United States]]. His publications on [[bioethics]] ([[human enhancement]] in particular), [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], and cosmopolitan [[justice]] are considered as influential writings in the international academic arena.

== Justice and Kant ==

Rakić is the author of a variety of books and articles from the domain of philosophy and political science. They include ''A Theory of the Normative Will'', [[History and Future of Justice]] and ''Hegemony, Culture and Human Resources in Politics''. In ''History and Future of Justice'' Rakić analyzes the [[teleological]] thesis that [[history]] in the long run is marked by a gradual development of [[morality]] and [[justice]], and that [[human]]ity will achieve a condition of “perfect justice” at the end of its historical development– provided that history will last sufficiently long. A topical book influenced by ''History and Future of Justice'' is ''[[The Evolution of God]]'', published in 2009 by [[Robert Wright (journalist)|Robert Wright]].

In a number of his writings Rakić shows that the essence of [[Immanuel Kant|Kant's]] understanding of the concept of justice in international relations is to be found in “[[Religion Within the Boundaries of Mere Reason”]], a book that has mostly escaped the attention of scholars dealing with this aspect of Kant's thought.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.routledge.com/books/details/9780415817295/ Vojin Rakić et al.(eds), 2013, ''The Semantics of State Building'', Routledge&lt;/ref&gt;

== Bioethics ==

During the previous years Rakić has been devoted to [[bioethics]], developing the concept of voluntary [[moral bioenhancement]], a recent field of interest of scientists dealing with [[human enhancement]]. Rakić favors moral enhancement, even with the help of medicines and other substances (e.g., [[oxytocin]], some [[SSRI]]s, [[dopamine]], propranalol), but only under the condition that their use is voluntary.
Rakić has polemicized on the one hand with [[John Harris (bioethicist)|John Harris]] (who believes that cognitive bio-enhancement is sufficient for our moral improvement) and, on the other hand, with [[Julian Savulescu]] and [[Ingmar Persson]] (who used to defend the idea of making moral bio-enhancement compulsory). These two authors and Rakić have polemicized with each other during 2013 in the [[Journal of Medical Ethics]]. Rakić opened the debate in February 2013&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/medethics-2012-100700 |pmid=23412695 |title=Voluntary moral enhancement and the survival-at-any-cost bias |journal=Journal of Medical Ethics |volume=40 |issue=4 |pages=246–250 |year=2014 |last1=Rakić |first1=Vojin }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Persson and Savulescu responded in March.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/medethics-2013-101423 |pmid=23525170 |title=Should moral bioenhancement be compulsory? Reply to Vojin Rakic |journal=Journal of Medical Ethics |volume=40 |issue=4 |pages=251–252 |year=2014 |last1=Persson |first1=Ingmar |last2=Savulescu |first2=Julian }}&lt;/ref&gt; During 2014 Rakić, [[Robert Sparrow (philosopher)|Robert Sparrow]] and [[Harris Wiseman]] polemicized in the [[American Journal of Bioethics]] on the same problem, as well as on other issues related to enhancement.

In 2012 Rakić founded the [[Center for the Study of Bioethics]], a research institute based in [[Belgrade]], [[Serbia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1017/S096318011300008X |pmid=23631816 |title=Philosophy for Public Good |journal=Cambridge Quarterly of Healthcare Ethics |volume=22 |issue=3 |pages=271–276 |year=2013 |last1=Rakić |first1=Vojin }}&lt;/ref&gt; CSB has internal and associate members. They include [[Peter Singer]], [[John Harris (bioethicist)|John Harris]], [[Don Marquis (philosopher)|Don Marquis]], [[Nicholas Agar]], [[Ingmar Persson]], [[James J. Hughes]] and [[Stefan Lorenz Sorgner]]. In May 2013 CSB attracted widespread attention by organizing a conference in [[Belgrade]] at which [[John Harris (bioethicist)|John Harris]] and [[Julian Savulescu]] confronted their differing positions on [[human enhancement]] and [[Autonomy|freedom]]. Their debate continued for several days in [[Belgrade]], not only at the conference (with [[Peter Singer]] as a discussant of their positions), but also in front of TV cameras.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.csb.eu.com/index_en.html Center for the study of bioethics&lt;/ref&gt; The Oxford Centre for Neuroethics co-organized the congress.

In October 2015 CSB organized another highly acclaimed bioethics conference in Belgrade, this time in collaboration with [[The Hastings Center]].The keynote speakers were [[John Harris (bioethicist)|John Harris]] and [[Erik Parens]]. Reports on the event have appeared in dozens of media.

On 16–19 August 2017, CSB organized, in cooperation with the [[European Society for the Philosophy of Medicine and Health Care]], the 31st ESPMH Annual Meeting "New Technologies in Health Care".

On 20–21 August 2017, CSB partnered with the Division of Medical Ethics in [[NYU School of Medicine]]´s Department of Population Health and [[The Hastings Center]], in order to organize the international conference “Genome editing: biomedical and ethical perspectives”. This event gathered an international group of ethics experts in order to discuss genome editing in humans and other living beings. The conference keynote speech included one that was delivered by [[Arthur Caplan]]. The conference was opened by the Serbian [[Prime Minister]] [[Ana Brnabic]].

== Social role ==

Rakić's role has not been limited to science and academia. In 2002 he became a special adviser of the [[United Nations]] to the [[Government of Serbia]]. During his work as a government adviser Rakic worked closely with Serbian Prime Minister [[Zoran Djindjic]], who was assassinated in 2003 by rogue elements of the Serbian [[secret police]] that were still loyal to ousted President [[Slobodan Milosevic]].

Before his commitments in the [[United Nations]] and the [[Government of Serbia]],  Rakić was a senior research fellow at the [[Center for Higher Education Policy Studies]] (CHEPS) of [[Twente University]] in the Netherlands.

Vojin Rakić spent much of his life in the [[Netherlands]], the United States, the [[Czech Republic]] and [[Italy]]. Currently he is a [[university professor]] in Belgrade.

'''Wolf reintroduction''' involves the [[reintroduction|reestablishment]] of a portion of [[gray wolf|gray wolves]] in areas where native wolves have been [[Local extinction|extirpated]].  Reintroduction is only considered where large tracts of suitable wilderness still exist and where certain prey species are abundant enough to support a predetermined wolf population.

== United States ==

===Arizona and New Mexico===
[[File:reintroducedmexicanwolf.jpg|right|thumb|Captive bred Mexican wolf in pen, Sevilleta National Wildlife Refuge.]]
The five last known wild [[Mexican wolf|Mexican gray wolves]] were captured in 1980 in accordance with an agreement between the United States and Mexico intended to save the critically endangered subspecies. Between 1982 and 1998 a comprehensive captive breeding program brought Mexican wolves back from the brink of extinction. Over 300 captive Mexican wolves were part of the recovery program.

The ultimate goal for these wolves, however, is to reintroduce them to areas of their former range. In March 1998, this reintroduction campaign began with the releasing of three packs into the [[Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest]] in Arizona, and eleven wolves into the [[Blue Range Wilderness|Blue Range Wilderness Area]] of New Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fws.gov/southwest/es/mexicanwolf/ "Mexican Gray Wolf Recovery Program"] U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service; archived here [https://www.webcitation.org/5z60fBpHp] by [[WebCite]]&lt;/ref&gt; Today, there may be up to 100 wild Mexican wolves in Arizona and New Mexico. The final goal for Mexican wolf recovery is a wild, self-sustaining population of at least 300 individuals.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;span class="plainlinks"&gt;{{cite web | title= USFWS| work= 2014 Mexican Wolf Population Survey Complete – Population Exceeds 100 -| url= http://www.fws.gov/southwest/es/mexicanwolf/pdf/fNR_Mexican_Wolf_winter_count_joint_Feb13-2015.pdf}}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

{{See also|History of wolves in Yellowstone}}
[[File:yellowstone wolfmap.svg|right|thumb|Map showing wolf packs in Yellowstone National Park as of 2002.]]
[[Grey wolf]] packs were reintroduced to Yellowstone National Park and Idaho starting in 1995. The subspecies native to the Yellowstone area prior to extirpation was the Northern Rocky Mountains wolf (''[[Canis lupus irremotus]]'') however the species that was reintroduced was the Mackenzie Valley wolf (''[[Canis lupus occidentalis]]'') though both subspecies were similar and their range overlapped across the region (needs citation). These wolves were considered as “experimental, non-essential” populations per article 10(j) of the [[Endangered Species Act]] (ESA). Such classification gave government officials greater leeway in managing wolves to protect livestock, which was considered one of a series of compromises wolf reintroduction proponents made with concerned local ranchers.

Indeed, local industry and environmental groups battled for decades over the Yellowstone and Idaho wolf reintroduction effort. The idea of wolf reintroduction was first brought to Congress in 1966 by biologists who were concerned with the critically high [[elk]] populations in Yellowstone and the ecological damages to the land from excessively large herds. Officially, 1926 was the year that the last wolves were killed within Yellowstone’s boundaries. When the wolves were eradicated and hunting eliminated, the elk population boomed. Over the succeeding decades, elk populations grew so large that they unbalanced the local ecosystem. The number of elk and other large prey animals increased to the point that they gathered in large herds along valley bottoms and meadows overgrazing new-growth vegetation. Because of overgrazing, deciduous woody plant species such as upland aspen and riparian cottonwood became seriously diminished. So, because the keystone predators, the wolves, had been removed from the Yellowstone-Idaho ecosystem, the ecosystem changed. This change affected other species as well. [[Coyotes]] filled in the niche left by wolves, but couldn't control the large ungulate populations. Booming coyote numbers, furthermore, also had a negative effect on other species, particularly the [[red fox]], pronghorn, and domestic sheep. Ranchers, though, remained steadfastly opposed to reintroducing a species of animal that they considered to be analogous to a plague, citing the hardships that would ensue with the potential loss of stock caused by wolves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://courses.washington.edu/envir100/readings/population/ripple2004.pdf|title=A problem has occurred|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The government, which was charged with creating, implementing, and enforcing a compromise, struggled for over two decades to find middle ground. A wolf recovery team was appointed in 1974, and the first official recovery plan was released for public comment in 1982. General public apprehension regarding wolf recovery forced the [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service|U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service]] to revise their plan to implement more control for local and state governments, so a second recovery plan was released for public comment in 1985. That same year, a poll conducted at Yellowstone National Park showed that 74% of visitors thought wolves would improve the park, while 60% favored reintroducing them. The preparation of an environmental impact statement, the last critical step before reintroduction could be green-lighted, was halted when Congress insisted that further research be done before an [[Environmental impact assessment#United States|Environmental Impact Statement]] (EIS) was to be funded.

[[File:YellowstoneWolfIntroductionGardinerMTJanuary1995.jpg|right|thumb|People look on as the grey wolves are trucked through Roosevelt Arch, Yellowstone National Park, January 1995.]]
In 1987, in an effort to shift the burden of financial responsibility from ranchers to the proponents of wolf reintroduction, Defenders of Wildlife set up a “wolf compensation fund” that would use donations to pay ranchers market value for any stock that was lost to wolf depredation. That same year, a final recovery plan was released. Following a long period of research, public education, and public commenting, a draft EIS was released for public review in 1993 and it received over 150,000 comments from interested parties. It was finalized in May 1994, and included a clause that specified that all wolves reintroduced to the recovery zones would be classified under the “experimental, non-essential” provision of the ESA. Though the original plan called for three recovery zones – one in Idaho, another in [[Montana]], and a final one in the Greater Yellowstone Area – the Montana recovery zone was eliminated from the final EIS after it had been proven that a small, but breeding population had already established itself in the northwestern part of the state. The plan stipulated that each of the three recovery areas must have ten breeding pairs of wolves successfully rearing two or more pups for three consecutive years before the minimum recovery goals would be reached.

[[File:Reintroduced wolves being carried to acclimation pens, Yellowstone National Park, January, 1995.jpg|right|thumb|Reintroduced wolves being carried to acclimation pens, Yellowstone National Park, January 1995.]]

A pair of lawsuits filed in late 1994 put the recovery plan in jeopardy. While one of the lawsuits was filed by the Wyoming Farm Bureau, the other was filed by a coalition of concerned environmental groups including the Idaho Conservation League and Audubon Society. The latter group pointed to unofficial wolf sightings as proof that wolves had already migrated down to Yellowstone from the north, which, they argued, made the plan to reintroduce an experimental population in the same area unlawful. According to their argument, if wolves were already present in Yellowstone, they should rightfully be afforded full protection under the ESA, which, they reasoned, was preferable to the limited “experimental” classification that would be given to any reintroduced wolves.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;span class="plainlinks"&gt;{{cite web | title= Defenders of Wildlife| work= A Yellowstone Chronology| url=http://www.defenders.org/wildlife/wolf/ynpchro.html| accessdate=May 3, 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060602062712/http://www.defenders.org/wildlife/wolf/ynpchro.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = June 2, 2006}}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Wolf in Yellowstone National Park NPS15047.jpg|right|thumb|Wolf in acclimation pen, Yellowstone National Park.]]

Nevertheless, both cases were thrown out on January 3, 1995. Adolescent members from packs of [[Mackenzie Valley wolf|Mackenzie Valley wolves]] in Alberta, Canada were tranquilized and carted down to the recovery zones later that week, but a last minute court order delayed the planned releases. The stay came from an appellate court in Denver and was instigated by the Wyoming Farm Bureau. After spending an additional 36 hours in transport cages in Idaho and in their holding pens in Yellowstone, the wolves were finally released following official judicial sanction. Yellowstone’s wolves stayed in acclimation pens for two more months before being released into the wild. Idaho’s wolves, conversely, were given a hard (or immediate) release. A total of 66 wolves were released to the two areas in this manner in January 1995 and January 1996.

2005 estimates of wolf populations in the two recovery zones reflect the success the species has had in both areas: 
* Greater Yellowstone Area: 325
* Central Idaho: 565

These numbers, added with the estimated number of wolves in northwestern Montana (130), puts the total number of wolves in the Northern [[Rocky Mountains]] recovery area at over 1000 individuals. This includes approximately 134 packs (two or more wolves traveling together) and 71 breeding pairs (male and female that successfully rear a litter of at least two until Dec. 31). The recovery goal for the area was revised to 30 breeding pairs total, and this number has been surpassed for some time.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;span class="plainlinks"&gt;{{cite web | title= USFWS| work= Rocky Mountain Wolf Recovery 2005 Interagency Annual Report| url=http://westerngraywolf.fws.gov/annualrpt05/2005_WOLF_REPORT_TOTAL.pdf|accessdate=May 3, 2006 }}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the decades since wolves have been present in the region, there have been hundreds of confirmed incidents of livestock depredation, though such predation represents a minute proportion of a wolf’s diet on a per wolf basis. While the majority of wolves ignore livestock entirely, a few wolves or wolf packs will become chronic livestock hunters, and most of these have been killed to protect livestock. Since the year Defenders of Wildlife implemented their compensation fund, they have allocated over $1,400,000 to private owners for proven and probable livestock depredation by wolves. Opponents argue that the Yellowstone reintroductions were unnecessary, as American wolves were never in danger of biological extinction since wolves still persisted in Canada. Opponents have also stated that wolves are of little commercial benefit, as cost estimates on wolf recovery are from $200,000 to $1 million per wolf. But the Lamar Valley is one of the best places in the world to observe wolves, and tourism based on wolves is booming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.yellowstonepark.com/MoreToKnow/ShowNewsDetails.aspx?newsid=182 | title = Gray Wolves increase tourism in Yellowstone National Park | author = Brodie Farquhar | journal = Yellowstone Journal and YellowstonePark.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The growing wolf-viewing outfitting trend contrasts with declines for big game hunters.  National Park Service Biologist Wayne Brewster informed guides and outfitters living north of Yellowstone National Park, to expect a fifty percent (50%) drop in harvestable game when wolves were reintroduced to Yellowstone National Park.&lt;ref name="Fact sheet"&gt;{{cite web| url =http://www.aws.vcn.com/fact.html | title= Fact Sheet- Wolf Reintroduction in the United States | publisher= Abundant Wildlife Society of North America | accessdate = 2008-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was confirmed when in 2006, the Yellowstone elk herd had in fact shrunk to 50% since the mid 1990s though researchers documented that most of the elk that fell prey to wolves were very old, diseased, or very young{{Citation Needed|date=December 2016}}. Two 30-day periods of tracking radio collared wolves showed that 77–97% of prey species documented by wolves in the park were elk. Outside the park, numerous hunting outfitters have closed due to the concomitant 90% reduction in elk permits.&lt;ref name="PI"&gt;{{cite book | author = Miniter, Frank |url =  | title = The Politically Incorrect Guide to Hunting | year = 2007 | publisher=Regnery Publishing|location=Washington, DC|isbn = 1-59698-521-6 | page = 269}}&lt;/ref&gt; Defenders of Wildlife transitioned from paying compensation to helping ranchers utilize nonlethal methods to better protect livestock from wolf predation. These methods include carcass removal to reduce attractants to scavengers, increased human presence near livestock, lighting, herd management, livestock guard dogs, and other measures (see http://www.defenders.org/sites/default/files/publications/livestock_and_wolves.pdf for more information).

The reintroduction of wolves, an apex predator, has had important impacts on [[biodiversity]] within Yellowstone National Park. Through predation of elk populations, wolf reintroduction has coincided with an increase of new-growth vegetation among certain plants, such as aspen and willow trees,&lt;ref name=LOE032015&gt;{{cite news|title=Beyond the Headlines|url=http://loe.org/shows/segments.html?programID=15-P13-00012&amp;segmentID=5|accessdate=March 22, 2015|work=Living on Earth|date=March 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; which elk previously grazed upon at unsustainable levels. Presence of wolves has even changed behavioral patterns of other animals. Elk have quit venturing into deeper thickets, out of fear of being attacked by wolves in an area of such low visibility. Elk have also begun avoiding open areas such as valley bottoms and open meadows where, prior to wolf introduction, the elk grazed collectively and avoided predation from mountain lions and bears. This process of [[Top-down and bottom-up design|top predators regulating the lower sections of the trophic pyramid]] was dubbed, "the ecology of fear" by William J. Ripple and Robert L. Bestcha&lt;ref&gt;Ripple, W; Beschta R: "Wolves and the Ecology of Fear:
Can Predation Risk Structure", page 761, "Bioscience", 2004 Vol. 54 No. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the restoration of vegetation several important species such as the [[beaver]]&lt;ref name=LOE032015/&gt; (which also became extinct in the park) and red fox have also recovered, probably due to the wolves keeping coyote populations under control.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;span class="plainlinks"&gt;{{cite web | title= Lessons from the Wolf – Bringing the top predator back to Yellowstone has triggered a cascade of unanticipated changes in the park's ecosystem | url=http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?chanID=sa006&amp;articleID=00076914-0667-10AA-84B183414B7F0000&amp;pageNumber=3&amp;catID=2 | accessdate=May 24, 2006 }}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The Idaho state government opposed the reintroduction of wolves into the state and many ranchers and hunters there feel as if the wolves were forced onto the state by the federal government. The state's wolf management plan is prefaced by the legislature's memorial declaring that the official position of the state is the removal of all wolves by any means necessary. Because of the state of Idaho's refusal to participate in wolf restoration, the US Fish and Wildlife Service and the Nez Perce tribe initially managed the wolf population there since the reintroduction.  During that time, the Idaho wolf population had made the most remarkable comeback in the region with its abundant federal lands and wilderness areas peaking at nearly 900 wolves (almost half of the regional wolf population) in 2009. However, the wolves have increasingly blamed for livestock and hunting opportunity losses. The US Fish and Wildlife Service attempted twice to delist wolves from federal protection and turn them over to state management but both of those attempts were found unlawful by the federal court in Missoula, Montana. In order to quell the political battle between the ranchers, hunters and conservationists, members of Congress removed Endangered Species Act protection from wolves in 2011 and gave wolf management to the states of Idaho and Montana under state wolf management plans. Since that time, the US Fish and Wildlife Service has also delisted wolves from federal protection in Wyoming and the state now has authority over wolf management there as well.  This decision is also being challenged as unlawful in court in 2013.

Despite being approved by the US Fish and Wildlife Service Idaho’s proposed management plan is still shrouded in controversy.  The plan &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fishandgame.idaho.gov/public/docs/wolves/plan02.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-03-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120512130739/https://fishandgame.idaho.gov/public/docs/wolves/plan02.pdf |archivedate=May 12, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; calls for 10 breeding pairs in Idaho or 100 to 150 wolves. Compared with the states' other wildlife numbers (e.g. 2000 - 3000 mountain lions, 20,000 American black bears, 100,000 elk and several hundred thousand mule deer), conservationists are concerned that too few wolves are protected under the plan. According to the US Fish and Wildlife Services guidelines the Idaho wolf population needs to stay above 100 individuals for the species to stay off the endangered species list and remain a viable, self-sustaining population.  However, there is much evidence that shows that a much larger wolf population can survive in Idaho without having major impacts on livestock and hunting opportunities. {{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}

In adjacent Washington State, wolves were not reintroduced, but populations have been reestablished through the natural expansion of the Idaho population. By 2008, wolves had established a permanent toehold in Washington, and have increased their number every year since.  The Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife tracks the "minimum numbers" of wolves.  This number in only counts wolves in known packs that den inside the State.  Lone wolves, suspected packs, and packs that range into the State but den outside the State are not counted.  In 2008, this "minimum number" was 5; by the end of 2014 it was 68.  Known wolf packs are concentrated in the northeastern corner of the state, but there are also packs in the central Cascades. In 2015, a wolf was killed on Interstate 90, approximately 10 west of the Snoqualmie Pass, proving the wolves are expanding westward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://wdfw.wa.gov/conservation/endangered/species/gray_wolf.pdf|title = Threatened and Endangered Species in Washington: 2012 Annual Report|last =|first =|date =|website =|publisher =|access-date =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Great Smoky Mountains National Park===
[[Red wolf|Red wolves]] were once native to the southeastern United States, but the last wolf seen in the vicinity of the park was in 1905. In 1991, two pairs were reintroduced into the [[Great Smoky Mountains National Park]]. Despite some early success, the program was cancelled in 1998 due to the death of wolf pups from malnutrition and disease, and the wolves roaming beyond the boundaries of the park.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mansfield|first=Duncan|title=Red wolf re-introduction program ends in Great Smoky Mountains|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=QYBDAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=aK4MAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2614,4796488&amp;dq=red+wolf+great+smoky+mountain&amp;hl=en|accessdate=November 15, 2010|newspaper=The Durant Daily Democrat|date=October 18, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; The wolves were relocated to North Carolina in 1998, ending the effort to reintroduce the species to the park.

===North and South Carolina===
[[File:Canis rufus walking in forest cropped.jpg|thumb|Canis rufus walking in forest]]
In Dec. 1976, two wolves were released onto [[Cape Romain National Wildlife Refuge]]'s Bulls Island in South Carolina with the intent of testing and honing reintroduction methods. They were not released with the intent of beginning a permanent population on the island.&lt;ref name="ref35"&gt;Carley, Curtis J. 1979. "Report on the Successful Trans location Experiment of Red Wolves (Canis rufus) to Bulls Island, S.C." Presentation at the Portland Wolf Symposium, Lewis and Clark College, Portland, Oregon, August 13–17, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt; The first experimental trans location lasted for 11 days, during which a mated pair of red wolves were monitored day and night with remote telemetry. A second experimental trans location was tried in 1978 with a different mated pair, and they were allowed to remain on the island for close to nine months.&lt;ref name="ref35"/&gt; After that, a larger project was executed in 1987 to reintroduce a permanent population of red wolves back to the wild in the [[Alligator River National Wildlife Refuge]] (ARNWR) on the eastern coast of [[North Carolina]]. Also in 1987, Bulls Island became the first island breeding site. Pups were raised on the island and relocated to North Carolina until 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fws.gov/caperomain/redwolf.html U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Cape Romain NWR, red wolf web page] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120104043938/http://www.fws.gov/caperomain/redwolf.html |date=January 4, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1987, four male-female pairs of red wolves were released in Alligator River National Wildlife Refuge in northeastern North Carolina and designated as an experimental population. Since then, the experimental population has grown and the recovery area expanded to include four national wildlife refuges, a Department of Defense bombing range, state-owned lands, and private lands, encompassing about {{convert|1700000|acre|km2}}.&lt;ref name="ref20"&gt;USFWS.2010. Red Wolf Recovery Program, 1st Quarter Report, October–December 2010, Manteco, NC.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the latest Red Wolf Recovery Program First Quarter Report (October–December 2010), the US Fish and Wildlife Service estimates that there are currently 110-130 red wolves in the Red Wolf Recovery Area in North Carolina, however, since not all of the newly bred in the wild red wolves have radio collars, they can only confirm a total of 70 "known" individuals, 26 packs, 11 breeding pairs, and 9 additional individuals not associated with a pack.&lt;ref name="ref22"&gt;"Current Red Wolf Facts," found on the Red Wolf Recovery web page, http://www.fws.gov/redwolf/index.html, accessed on July 5, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Interbreeding with the coyote (a species not native to North Carolina{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}) has been recognized as a threat affecting the restoration of red wolves. Currently, adaptive management efforts are making progress in reducing the threat of coyotes to the red wolf population in northeastern North Carolina. Other threats, such as habitat fragmentation, disease, and anthropogenic mortality, are of concern in the restoration of red wolves. Efforts to reduce the threats are presently being explored.&lt;ref name="ref22"/&gt;

Over 30 facilities participate in the red wolf [[Species Survival Plan]] and oversee the breeding and reintroduction of over 150 wolves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pdza.org/page.php?id=296 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-09-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110524225431/http://www.pdza.org/page.php?id=296 |archivedate=May 24, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gulf coast===
In 1989, the second island propagation project was initiated with release of a population on [[Horn Island (Mississippi)|Horn Island]] off the Mississippi coast. This population was removed in 1998 because of a likelihood of encounters with humans. The third island propagation project introduced a population on [[St. Vincent Island, Florida]] offshore between [[Cape San Blas]] and [[Apalachicola, Florida]] in 1990, and in 1997 the fourth island propagation program introduced a population to [[Cape St. George Island]], [[Florida]] south of Apalachicola, Florida.

==Europe==

===Northern Europe===
In Sweden and Norway, there has been a long and ongoing conflict between some groups whose belief it is that wolves have no place in human inhabited areas and those who wish the wolf to be allowed to expand out into more of the area’s vast [[Taiga|boreal forests]]. The former mostly consists of members of the rural working class who fear competition for certain large ungulate species ([[roe deer]], moose, etc.), and who consider the wolf to be a foreign element. They argue that modern [[Scandinavia]]n wolves are actually recent migrants from Russia and not the remnants of old native wolf packs, which, they reason, is why they do not belong in Sweden and Norway.

Scandinavian wolves had been nearly completely eliminated from the range due to [[Local extinction|extirpation]] campaigns in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, and were considered to be gone from the area by the 1960s.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} In the early 1980s, however, a single breeding pack was discovered in southern Sweden, over 1000&amp;nbsp;km away from the nearest known population in Russia or Eastern Finland.  The pack was small – about ten animals – and it stayed that way for many years until its population began to noticeably increase starting in 1991. Prior to 1991, the small population lacked ideal genetic diversity, and inbreeding had been occurring to a potentially dangerous degree. Furthermore, low birth rates suggest that the wolves were apprehensive to mate with each other, which was most likely due to their close relation. Genetic data suggests that, in 1991, a lone immigrant wolf from Russia migrated to the area and single-handedly restored genetic diversity to the population. A particular study showed that of the 72 wolves born between 1993 and 2001, 68 of them could trace their genetic heritage to this lone migrant wolf. Today, there are over one hundred individuals that range across this southern area of Scandinavia.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;span class="plainlinks"&gt;{{cite web | title= ‘’Nature’’ | work= Conservation biology: Lone wolf to the rescue | url= http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v420/n6915/full/420472a.html| accessdate=May 4, 2006 }}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
The population remains genetically isolated, however, which is a cause of concern for some. On the other hand, there is reason to believe that as the number of wolves living in this area increases, the boundaries of the population's range will creep towards the ranges of other, separate populations in Finland, thus promoting dispersal. Direct reintroduction remains an intriguing option to foster genetic diversity in the Scandinavian population in the meantime.

There has been much speculation as to how the original population came to be in the early 1980s. Some believe that they might be a native species – remnants of a population that somehow survived persecution. Much genetic research has been performed on this population, however, and this particular theory isn’t supported by the findings. Genetic analysis seems to support the idea that the wolves were immigrants that had traveled over 1000&amp;nbsp;km from Russia to southern Scandinavia along one of several possible dispersal routes. Certain people believe that they were artificially reintroduced per some secret agenda by the Swedish government.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;span class="plainlinks"&gt;{{cite web | title= ‘’Wildlife Biology’’| work= The origin of the southern Scandinavian wolf ‘’Canis Lupus’’ population | url=http://www.wildlifebiology.com/2005/4/linnell.pdf | accessdate=May 4, 2006 }}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Central and Western Europe===

In several areas in Europe, reintroduction of wolves to areas where they have become extinct is being actively considered. Charities in many European countries including Denmark, Germany, Italy, Ireland and the United Kingdom &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/6310211.stm|title=BBC NEWS - Science/Nature - Wild wolves 'good for ecosystems'|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; are also advocating the reintroduction of wolves to specific rural and forested areas. Most plans have been met with a mixture of enthusiasm and unease by different population groups. Opponents fear the loss of livestock that may result from their reintroduction. In several countries, charity based compensation plans (similar to those that operate in the USA) have been proposed.

The reintroduction of wolves to [[Scotland]] and [[England]] is currently being considered, along with [[brown bear|bears]] and [[lynx]], as part of a larger effort to reintroduce native species to the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snh.gov.uk/protecting-scotlands-nature/safeguarding-biodiversity/reintroducing-native-species/|title=Reintroducing native species - Scottish Natural Heritage|first=MHMG - Scottish Natural|last=Heritage|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/nature/22287080|title=The big predator debate|date=July 22, 2013|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wolvesandhumans.org/wolves/wolf_reintroduction_to_scotland.htm|title=Reintroducing the wolf to Scotland - Wolves and Humans Foundation|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
