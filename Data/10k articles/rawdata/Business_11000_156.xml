'''Antonio Mattei Lluberas'''&lt;ref group=note&gt;{{Spanish name|'''Mattei'''|'''Lluberas'''|plain=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; (September 7, 1857 – January 15, 1908), was a businessman and politician who in 1897 planned and led the second and last major uprising against Spanish colonial rule in [[Puerto Rico]], known as the [[Intentona de Yauco]].

==Early years==
Mattei Lluberas was born in the town of [[Yauco, Puerto Rico]] to Antonio Mattei Casanova and Mercedes Lluberas Torres de Figueroa. Mattei Lluberas' father's parents, who were of [[Corsican people|Corsican]] descent, sent him to France where he received his primary and secondary education.&lt;ref name="GHA"&gt;[http://home.coqui.net/sarrasin/pers12.htm Protagonistas de la Guerra Hispano Americana en Puerto Rico Parte XII]&lt;/ref&gt;

He returned to Puerto Rico and became a wealthy businessman after he established a successful coffee plantation. He later married Ana María Rita Emmanuelli Negroni, the (daughter of Louis Henri Emanuelli Ciavaldini b 1824 [[Corsica]] and Ana Maria Negroni Rodriguez) and had three children: Rita María, Rita Monserrate and Luis Antonio.&lt;ref name="GHA"/&gt;

==Intentona de Yauco==
[[File:Intentona de Yauco.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Flag flown by Fidel Vélez and his men during the "Intentona de Yauco" revolt]]
{{Main article|Intentona de Yauco}}
Mattei Lluberas was among the many Puerto Ricans at the time who professed liberal ideals and believed that Puerto Rico should be an independent nation free from Spanish Colonial rule. As such, he became involved with the island's revolutionary movement and became one of their leaders.&lt;ref name="GHA"/&gt; In 1896, Mattei Lluberas met with Mateo Mercado and a group of "Yaucanos" (as the natives of Yauco are known) who believed in full independence of Puerto Rico in ''Barrio Barinas'' of Yauco and made plans to overthrow the government. On December of that year, the local Civil Guard discovered their plans and proceeded to arrest all those involved who, besides Mercado and Mattei Lluberas, included Dario and Carlos Franchesi and Emiliano Lavergue, however they were soon released and returned to their respective homes.&lt;ref name="HMPR"&gt;''Historia militar de Puerto Rico'', by [[Hector Andres Negroni]] (Author); Pages: 305–06; Publisher: Sociedad Estatal Quinto Centenario (1992); Spanish; {{ISBN|84-7844-138-7}}; {{ISBN|978-84-7844-138-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1897, Mattei Lluberas visited the Puerto Rican Revolutionary Committee in New York City. There he met with Ramon Emeterio Betances, Juan de Mata Terreforte and Aurelio Méndez Martinez and together they proceeded to plan a major coup. The uprising was to be directed by Betances, organized by Mendez Mercado and the armed forces were to be commanded by General Rius Rivera. At the time Rius Rivera, who joined [[José Martí]]'s struggle for Cuban independence as a member of the Cuban Liberation Army, was the Commander-in-Chief of the Cuban Liberation Army of the West.&lt;ref&gt;[http://solidaridad_cuba.tripod.com/id50.html ''Noticias de la XVII Brigada Juan Rius Rivera en Cuba'']{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In accordance to the plan, Mattei Lluberas purchased 30,000 machetes which were to be distributed amongst the rebels. Mattei Lluberas returned to Puerto Rico with a [[Flag of Puerto Rico|Puerto Rican flag]] and began to proceed with the plans of the revolt with his group. The Budet Rivera brothers established an insurgent training camp in the farm of Gullermo Velazco. Fellow rebels, Gerardo Forest Velez and Agustin F. Morales (himself a general in the Army of the [[Dominican Republic]]), were in charge of propaganda and traveled throughout the island seeking public support for their cause. Cuban revolutionist Tomas Estrada Palma, offered a contribution of 500 rifles with half a million rounds of ammunition and his comrade offered a steamship with an invading force of 200 men under the command of General Agustin F. Morales. The revolution was set for the beginning of the month of December 1897.&lt;ref name="MHPR"&gt;''Historia militar de Puerto Rico'', by [[Hector Andres Negroni]] (Author); Pages: 307; Publisher: Sociedad Estatal Quinto Centenario (1992); Spanish; {{ISBN|84-7844-138-7}}; {{ISBN|978-84-7844-138-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mayor of Yauco Francisco Lluch Barreras heard the rumors of the planned uprising, he immediately notified General Sabas Marín González the governor of the island.

Fidel Velez, a native of [[Sabana Grande, Puerto Rico|Sabana Grande]] and one of the separatist leaders, found out that the Spanish authorities knew about their plans and immediately held a meeting with Mattei Lluberas and the other leaders. Fearing that they all would soon be arrested, he demanded that the insurrection start immediately and not in December. In the discussion that followed, the other leaders did not agree with him, fearing that such a haste action would lead to the same disastrous results of ''[[El Grito de Lares]]''.&lt;ref name="MHPR"/&gt;

On March 24, 1897, Fidel Velez and his men met at Susua Arriba, just outside Yauco. They unfurled the Puerto Rican flag for the first time in Puerto Rican soil.&lt;ref&gt;[http://joseosvaldo.freeyellow.com/Sabiausted.htm Sabia Usted?] {{es icon}}, Sabana Grande, Retrieved Feb. 25, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://flagspot.net/flags/pr.html#f The Flag], Flags of the World, Retrieved Feb. 25, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; and marched towards the town. They planned to attack the barracks of the Spanish Civil Guard with the aim of gaining control of the arms and ammunition which were stored there. The plan did not succeed because when they arrived they were ambushed by the Spanish forces who had set up positions and were waiting for them. A firefight ensued upon the arrival of the group and the rebels quickly retreated. On March 26, another group headed by Jose Nicolas Quiñones Torres and Ramon Torres attempted to fight the Spaniards in a barrio called "Quebradas" of Yauco, however said revolt also failed.&lt;ref name="MHPR"/&gt; Over 150 rebels were arrested, accused of various crimes against the state and sent to prison in the City of [[Ponce, Puerto Rico|Ponce]]. Velez fled to [[Saint Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands|St. Thomas]] where he lived in exile, while Mattei Lluberas went into exile in New York City and joined a group known as the "Puerto Rican Commission".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.proyectosalonhogar.com/Enciclopedia_Ilustrada/Documentos_historicos/Protagonistas/P12.htm Projecto Salon Hogar] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304092737/http://www.proyectosalonhogar.com/Enciclopedia_Ilustrada/Documentos_historicos/Protagonistas/P12.htm |date=2016-03-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mattei Lluberas and the [[Puerto Rican Commission]] in New York had been trying to convince President [[William McKinley]] to invade Puerto Rico for sometime. After Cuba was taken during the [[Spanish–American War]], President McKinley approved the land invasion of Puerto Rico. A convoy of ships left [[Tampa, Florida]] and on July 21 another convoy departed from [[Guantánamo]] for a 4-day journey to Puerto Rico.&lt;ref name="AAMPR"&gt;

Under the terms of the [[Treaty of Paris (1898)|Treaty of Paris of 1898]], ratified on December 10, 1898, Puerto Rico was annexed by the United States.

==Later years==
In 1904, Mattei Lluberas was elected Mayor of Yauco as a candidate of the pro-statehood Republican Party of Puerto Rico. Mattei Lluberas died on January 15, 1908.&lt;ref name="SH"/&gt; The town of Yauco honored his memory by naming an avenue after him.

Vehicles of creating artificial demand can include [[mass media]] advertising, which can create demand for [[good (economics)|goods]], [[Service (economics)|services]], [[policy|political policies]] or [[political platform|platforms]], and other entities.

Another example of artificial demand can be seen in [[penny stock]] [[Spam (e-mail)|spam]]. After purchasing a large number of shares of an extremely low-value stock, the spammer attempts to create artificial demand by implementing a spam-based [[guerrilla marketing]] strategy.

'''Asa Griggs "Buddy" Candler Jr.''' (August 27, 1880 – January 11, 1953, Atlanta)&lt;ref name=grave&gt;[https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/14991070 Find a Grave]&lt;/ref&gt; was the eccentric son of [[Asa Griggs Candler]], co-founder of [[Coca-Cola]]. Candler Jr. helped build his father's business into an empire. He later became a real-estate developer, opening the [[Briarcliff Hotel]] at the corner of [[Ponce de Leon Avenue]] and N. Highland Ave. in [[Virginia Highland]].

==Life and career==

===Education and career===
Asa Jr. attended [[Oxford College of Emory University|Emory College]] at its original campus in [[Oxford, Georgia]] and was a classmate of the future vice president [[Alben W. Barkley]].&lt;ref name=pilot&gt;[http://files.usgwarchives.org/va/virginiabeach/obits/obitsc.txt Asa Candler Jr. obituary, ''Virginian Pilot''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111123030052/http://files.usgwarchives.org/va/virginiabeach/obits/obitsc.txt |date=November 23, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After graduation he helped set up bottling plants for Coca-Cola across North America. He also supervised construction of various office buildings in Atlanta and of Candler Airport, now known as the [[Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=430cAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=zWQEAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=asa-candler-jr&amp;pg=2200%2C1863676 "Asa Candler Jr. dies in Atlanta", ''Sarasota Herald-Tribune'', January 12, 1953]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Briarcliff Farm===
In 1910, Candler moved from the fashionable [[Inman Park]] neighborhood where his father also had a mansion, to a "ramshackle" farmhouse on Briarcliff Farm, {{Convert|42|acres|ha}} on Williams Mill Road in what is now the [[Druid Hills, Georgia|Druid Hills]] neighborhood near [[Atlanta]]. Williams Mill Road was renamed Briarcliff Road in the 1920s after the estate that Candler built there. The farm was just north of [[Callanwolde]], his brother Charles Howard Candler's estate. Candler Jr. managed a huge agricultural operation which provided meat and produce to local retailers. Cows, sheep, pigs, and chickens were raised on the farm. During [[World War I]], Briarcliff Farm supplied milk to [[Fort Gordon]].&lt;ref name=dhn&gt;[http://druidhills.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/dhn_fall07.pdf "Briarcliff", ''Druid Hills News'', Druid Hills Civic Association, Fall 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

The farm was lauded for its use of electric lights and fans, even individual drinking fountains for the cows, its cleanliness, and its air and light, resulting in sanitary conditions that led to higher yields and quality.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=sjxOAAAAYAAJ&amp;lpg=PA996&amp;ots=9Gtt_hOamh&amp;dq=%22briarcliff%20farm%22%20atlanta&amp;pg=PA995 "Use of electricity on dairy farms to increase production", ''Electrical Review'', vol. 73, no. 26, Dec. 28, 1918]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Briarcliff estate and mansion===
[[File:Asa G. Candler, Jr. Mansion.JPG|thumb|Asa G. Candler Jr. Mansion, 2012]]
{{Main|Briarcliff (mansion)}}
In 1916 he began plans to turn the farm into an estate with a mansion, [[Briarcliff (mansion)|Briarcliff]]. Briarcliff was built between 1920 and 1922, and featured a [[Georgian Revival]] exterior. Architect Dan Bodin assisted Frazier in overseeing the completion.  In 1925 Candler had the mansion enlarged, including the {{convert|1700|ft2|m2}} music room, now DeOvies Hall, with its vaulted Tudor interior, limestone fireplace and painted walls.&lt;ref name=gr&gt;[http://thegeorgianrevival.wordpress.com/2009/12/09/an-unwritten-chapter-of-briarcliff-road/ "Clement J. Ford: The Gentleman Architect", ''The Georgian Revival'' (blog)]&lt;/ref&gt;

His father and older brother had [[Aeolian Company|Aeolian]] organs, and to outdo them, in 1925 Candler had a $94,000, 88-rank, 187-stop, cathedral-sized Aeolian installed in the music room.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=lkrzcTYnNV8C&amp;lpg=PA133&amp;ots=jtTLQKvq1B&amp;dq=asa%20griggs%20%22candler%20jr%22&amp;pg=PA133 Craig Whitney, "All the Stops: The Glorious Pipe Organ and Its American Masters", p.133]&lt;/ref&gt; It was the largest privately owned organ in Georgia at the time, and the 8th largest that Aeolian had ever built for a private residence. It was inaugurated in November 1925 in a recital by family friend [[Palmer Christian]], which was broadcast over radio station [[WSB (AM)|WSB]]. IN 1952 the organ was given to [[Wesleyan College]] in [[Macon, Georgia]]. It was renovated in 2008 and is now known as the Goodwyn-Candler-Panoz organ.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wesleyancollege.edu/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=dKUVPGxgEu0%3D&amp;tabid=431 "Celebrating Aeolian Opus 1542", ''Wesleyan'' magazine, Fall/Winter 2008] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110806023630/http://www.wesleyancollege.edu/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=dKUVPGxgEu0%3D&amp;tabid=431 |date=2011-08-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mansion also included a golf course, two swimming pools (one open to the public for 25 cents per person), and a private zoo.&lt;ref name=gk&gt;[http://www.dekalb.k12.ga.us/DruidHills/neighborhood/history-dh-comm.rtf Gail King, "History of the Druid Hills Community'']&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sale of the estate===

[[File:Briarcliff Hotel 2012.JPG|thumb|[[Briarcliff Hotel]] at [[Ponce de Leon Avenue|Ponce de Leon]] and [[Highland Avenue (Atlanta)|N. Highland]] avenues, in the penthouse of which Candler lived out his later years]]
The Candlers sold their estate to the [[General Services Administration]] in 1948. The planned veterans' hospital never emerged, and the estate was used to house the Georgian Clinic (later the DeKalb County Addiction Center), the first alcohol treatment facility in Georgia - poignant as Asa Jr. was a severe alcoholic himself. Later the complex housed the Georgia Mental Health Institute.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elephant.se/location2.php?location_id=690&amp;show=3 Elephant Encyclopedia]&lt;/ref&gt; The complex is now the Briarcliff campus of [[Emory University]].

Candler lived out his later life in the penthouse of the Briarcliff Hotel, and was buried in [[Westview Cemetery]].&lt;ref name=grave /&gt;

==Hobbies and eccentricities==
Candler was a big game hunter and aviation enthusiast.&lt;ref name=grave/&gt; He participated in many local and national air races.

Another hobby was magic and sleight of hand tricks which he learned on his travels to China and India. A 1930 report described how his mansion had a room full of equipment for magic shows, and that every spring he would hold a "high-jinks" magic show and party for friends.&lt;ref name=ei&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=_PtPAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=61QDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6225%2C1818193 "Mr. and Mrs. Asa Candler Jr. fly from to St. Petersburg from home in Atlanta, Ga., in three hours", ''Evening Independent'' (St. Petersburg, Fla.), January 1, 1930]&lt;/ref&gt;

He was an alcoholic and suffered from depression.&lt;ref name=bgsu&gt;[http://blog.lib.umn.edu/gschache/greggblogs/sacred%20changes/Sacred%20Changes-Spiritual%20conversion%20%26%20Transformation.pdf Annette Mahoney,"Sacred Changes", Bowling Green State University] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121011073833/http://blog.lib.umn.edu/gschache/greggblogs/sacred%20changes/Sacred%20Changes-Spiritual%20conversion%20%26%20Transformation.pdf |date=October 11, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Candler collected exotic birds and animals in a menagerie held at his estate with cages designed by architect Bodin.&lt;ref name=gr/&gt; He may have bought the animals while traveling in Europe from a down-and-out circus owner.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emory.edu/EMORY_MAGAZINE/issues/2011/autumn/of_note/neighborhood.html "Neighborhood Character", ''Emory Magazine'', August 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; The collection included a Bengal tiger, four lions, a black leopard, a gorilla, baboons, and six elephants: Coca, Cola, Pause, Refreshes, Refreshing, and Delicious.&lt;ref name=gk/&gt; In 1935 Candler was in financial trouble. He put up his pipe organ for sale. 

Candler's neighbor sued him and won a $10,000 settlement because "a baboon jumped over the wall of the zoo and devoured $60 in currency out of her purse".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,748775,00.html#ixzz1HXimn000 Time Magazine]&lt;/ref&gt; He gave away his entire menagerie of animals to the Atlanta City zoo at Grant Park (now [[Zoo Atlanta]]).

==Marriages==
Candler's first marriage was in 1901 to Helen Magill, daughter of the late Col. John H. Magill, former editor of the [[Hartwell, Georgia]] ''Sun'' and Laura Eberhardt Magill. Helen was "a leading figure in local social and civic circles" in Atlanta both before and during her marriage active in the [[United Daughters of the Confederacy]], the Fine Arts club, the Atlanta Woman's club, and the Atlanta Garden club.&lt;ref name=obit2&gt;[http://files.usgwarchives.org/ga/hart/obits/c/candler9694gob.txt "DEATH SUMMONS BELOVED WOMAN", ''Atlanta Constitution'', 30 Jan 1927] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120421042628/http://files.usgwarchives.org/ga/hart/obits/c/candler9694gob.txt |date=April 21, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Helen was frequently lauded in the local press for her elegant "toilets", a term used at the time for dresses or gowns.&lt;ref&gt;[https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/ajc_historic/access/513928502.html?dids=513928502:513928502&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:AI&amp;date=Apr+28%2C+1920&amp;author=&amp;pub=The+Atlanta+Constitution&amp;desc=BEAUTIFUL+TOILETTES+MAKE+AUDITORIUM+KALEIDOSCOPE+OF+COLOR&amp;pqatl=google "BEAUTIFUL TOILETTES MAKE AUDITORIUM KALEIDOSCOPE OF COLOR: Panorama of Fashion Formed by Box Parties At New Farrar Opera", ''Atlanta Constitution'', April 18, 1920]&lt;/ref&gt; Helen died in January 1927, aged 40. Asa Jr.'s uncle Bishop [[Warren Akin Candler]] officiated at her funeral, and she was buried, as her husband later was, in [[Westview Cemetery]].&lt;ref name=obit2/&gt;

In October 1927 Bishop Warren Candler married Asa Jr. to his second wife Florence Adeline Stephenson of [[Lithonia, Georgia]], who for nine years had been his secretary.&lt;ref&gt;[https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/ajc_historic/access/856221772.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:AI&amp;type=historic&amp;date=Oct+15%2C+1927&amp;author=&amp;pub=The+Atlanta+Constitution+(1881-2001)&amp;desc=ASA+CANDLER%2C+JR.%2C+QUIETLY+MARRIED&amp;pqatl=google "Asa Candler, Jr., Quietly Married", ''Atlanta Constitution'', October 15, 1927]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Children==
Asa and Helen's children included three sons, Asa G. III, who died at 7 months of age, John H. (1905–1947),&lt;ref name=fmc&gt;[http://www.atlantafirstumc.org/pages/aboutus/history-historicmembers.html "Our History: Historic Former Members", Atlanta First United Methodist Church website] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425130341/http://www.atlantafirstumc.org/pages/aboutus/history-historicmembers.html |date=April 25, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; who moved to [[Baltimore]], and Samuel, who remained in Atlanta. They had four daughters: Laura, Helen, Martha, and Lucy.&lt;ref name=obit2/&gt;{{dead link|date=October 2016}}

==Religion==
Asa was a member of the Atlanta First United Methodist Church at 360 Peachtree Street.&lt;ref name=fmc/&gt; A 1951 interview states that his alcoholism, depression, and other troubles were mitigated by a "surrender to God."

[[File:Ashapatti letterhead.jpg|thumb|Letterhead of the firm Ashapatti &amp; Son in the 1930s.]]
'''Ashapatti Tamrakar''' ([[Devanagari]]: आशापति ताम्रकार) (1904–1942) was a pioneer [[optician]] of [[Nepal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last= Tuladhar|first= Kamal Ratna|title= Herbalist, Optician, Compounder and Merchant|url= |accessdate=|newspaper=Matina|date=November 2009}} {{BLCAT|ZK.9.b.25686}} Page 4.&lt;/ref&gt; He imported and dispensed spectacles, and was trained in [[ophthalmology]] and orthoposcopy when such specialists were practically unheard of in Nepal.

== Early life ==

[[Tamrakar]] was born in [[Maru, Kathmandu|Maru]], [[Kathmandu Durbar Square]] to father Pranpati and mother Hera Laxmi. His father was a [[herbalist]], and he trained under him and joined the family business of dispensing herbal medicines. The Tamrakars had given up their ancestral occupation generations ago. Many of Tamrakar's relatives were [[artisans]] and practiced their hereditary occupation of making household utensils of copper and lamps and other ritual objects of silver, according to the division of labor laid down in ancient times.

Tamrakar's first wife died leaving him a son Rampati. In 1927, he got married a second time to Moti Lani [[Tuladhar]] who bore him a daughter Hira Shobha.

== Medical practice ==

Tamrakar's firm Ashapatti &amp; Son, which was based in his home, imported spectacles from India. Subsequently, he imported an edging machine and also made reading glasses. In 1935, he travelled to [[Kolkata]] and enrolled at United Optical Service at 54 [[Bowbazar]] Street to receive training in ophthalmology and orthoposcopy. 

Besides being an optician, Tamrakar was engaged as a herbalist and compounder. In 1939, he went to Kolkata and served briefly as a dresser in the wards and operation theater of Campbell Medical School and Hospital, which has since been renamed Nil Ratan Sircar Medical College and Hospital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | date=| url=http://nrsmc.tripod.com/his.htm|title=This is the story of Nil Ratan Sircar Medical College|work=|accessdate=3 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also worked as an anesthetist at [[Bir Hospital]] in Kathmandu.

==Forward-minded==

Tamrakar was a firm believer in female education, an idea which was frowned upon during his time. He insisted on his daughter going to school and enrolled her at Kanya Pathshala at Durbar Square, one of the very few in existence in the country. This was a school for girls run by Chandra Kanta Joshi, sister of martyr [[Shukraraj Shastri|Shukra Raj Shastri]].

Tamrakar contracted [[tuberculosis]] in his later years for which treatment was not available in Nepal in those days. He died at his home in 1942 at the age of 38.

BDO USA, LLP was founded as '''Seidman and Seidman''' in [[New York City]] in 1910 by three immigrant brothers:  Maximillian L. Seidman, Francis E. Seidman, and Jacob S. Seidman. At that time the accounting profession was in its infancy, with fewer than 2,200 practicing CPAs in the United States. Shortly thereafter in 1913, the [[16th Amendment to the United States Constitution]] was ratified, followed by the [[Revenue Act of 1913]] with new impositions of [[Income tax in the United States|U.S. Federal income tax]] enacted by Congress in that year. M. L. Seidman  saw the potential of the accountant's role to provide tax services to individuals. By 1917, Congress enacted the first revenue bills and the U.S. entry into [[World War I]] created the need for corporate income and excess profit taxes. At the same time, federal spending rose to $18.9 billion with 58 percent of the federal revenues provided from income taxes. M.L. Seidman and his siblings, who joined him in his new accounting firm, seized the opportunity to provide tax services to businesses in addition to individuals.

===Expansion===
An era of expansion began. Fostered by the federal government's conversion of furniture and woodworking companies to aircraft production for the war effort, the firm opened an office in Grand Rapids, Michigan in 1917. Seidman and Seidman quickly established itself as a leader in serving the furniture industry by developing the first effective furniture plant costing system. Today, BDO Seidman's Furniture Industry practice remains in the industry.

In 1925, the firm rapidly expanded, opening offices in [[Jamestown, Illinois]], and [[Rockford, Illinois]], followed by [[Chicago]] in 1921, and [[Gardner, Massachusetts]] in 1924. In 1922, J. S. Seidman joined the firm as a founding member.

The 1930s brought another new beginning for the accounting profession. In 1933, Congress passed the Securities Act, requiring public corporations to have financial statements included in registration statements and periodic reports reported on by independent CPAs. A year later, the Securities and Exchange Commission was created to administer the new legislation.

In 1950, [[L. William Seidman]] joined the firm and ultimately became its managing partner before leaving for government service, most notably as Chair of the FDIC.&lt;ref name=bloom&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=aL39kRBP7IhU William Seidman, Who Led Cleanup of S&amp;L Crisis, Dies], ''Bloomberg'', May 13, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===Development of the national firm===
The firm continued to grow and by the 1960s, truly became a national firm. On April 1, 1968, the firm was converted into a national general partnership. This marked the beginning of a new era of expansion. Over the years to the present, the firm established many offices throughout the United States.  Founding Partner Keith Beresheim was instrumental in helping BDO grow its practice and become a national tier firm.

==Present==

Today, BDO USA, LLP has more than 60 offices and more than 400 independent Alliance firm locations nationwide.  During this timeframe, [[BDO International]] was created and has grown to become the fifth largest accounting and consulting network in the world with over 1,400 Member Firm offices in 135 countries.

In February 2009, BDO USA, LLP launched the firm's first-ever national advertising campaign: "PEOPLE WHO KNOW, KNOW BDO".

In June 2012, the Monitor (Joseph A. Smith, Jr.) of the National Mortgage Settlement announced he engaged BDO USA, LLP as his primary professional firm.  BDO will join the Monitor and his team for a period of three and a half years as they oversee implementation of the historic National Mortgage Settlement involving 49 states, the United States government and five of the nation's largest banks.

==Controversies==
BDO has been involved in a number of engagements which resulted in major litigation and press attention.

===Washington, D.C. tax scandal (November 2007–10)===
A group of DC government employees had embezzled funds by fraudulently issuing real estate tax refund checks to their friends.  BDO Seidman was the independent auditor of the DC government's financial records. On November 21, 2007, Reuters wrote "Washington, D.C., officials should fix problems identified in an audit that found the city mishandled millions of dollars, according to Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton, who represents the U.S. capital in Congress&amp;nbsp;... The audit, conducted by accounting firm BDO Seidman, LLP, found that financial reporting for the city's school system and Medicaid programs did not match their financial statements, making both areas vulnerable to fraud&amp;nbsp;... Altogether, auditors found more than 160 instances where the city failed to comply with conditions for spending federal money, primarily by misreporting funds and mismanaging cash." As of November 2007, it was estimated that over $30 million were scammed by [[Washington, DC]] tax officials since 1999. At the height of the scam, half of the [[property tax]] refund checks were fraudulent. The average legitimate check was less than $10,000 while the average scam check was over $300,000. "The scandal may also singe BDO Seidman, a private audit firm that gave [Washington DC CFO Natwar] Gandhi its seal of approval earlier this year. Its auditors were paid millions to go over the city's books and gave Gandhi's office an unqualified opinion."{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} In 2010, a mentally ill woman, who was not a DC employee was able to exploit a security loophole in DC's financial systems to file tax returns claiming $19.1 million in refunds, but these were stopped.{{relevance inline|date=December 2015}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/woman-worms-into-d.c.-taxpayer-accounts/article/17483|title=Woman worms into D.C. taxpayer accounts|first=Michael |last=Neibauer|date=February 5, 2010|accessdate=2010-12-30|work=Washington Examiner}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- this is not the blacklisted examiner.com --&gt;

===New York Law School and Madoff scandal (December 2008)===
On December 16, 2008, in connection with the [[Bernard Madoff]] scandal, the [[New York Law School]] filed a lawsuit against [[J. Ezra Merkin]], [[Ascot Partners]], and its auditor BDO Seidman, after losing its $3 million investment in Ascot. The lawsuit charged Merkin with recklessness, gross negligence and breach of fiduciary duties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/business/article/0,8599,1867092,00.html|title=The Madoff Fraud: How Culpable Were the Auditors?|first=Stephen|last=Gandel|date=December 17, 2008|work=TIME magazine|accessdate=2010-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Use dmy dates|date=May 2013}}

In many countries, a '''blue-collar worker''' is a [[working class]] person who performs [[manual labour|manual labor]]. Blue-collar work may involve skilled or unskilled [[manufacturing]], [[mining]], sanitation, [[Janitor|custodial work]], [[textile industry|textile manufacturing]], [[commercial fishing]], [[food processing]], [[roughneck|oil field]] work, [[Waste management|waste disposal]], and [[recycling]], [[construction]], [[mechanic]], [[Maintenance (technical)|maintenance]], [[warehousing]], technical installation, and many other types of physical work. Blue-collar work often involves something being physically built or maintained.
[[File:Working man-obrero 2.jpg|thumb|right|150px|A [[manual labor]]er at work in [[Venezuela]].]]
In contrast, the [[white-collar worker]] typically performs work in an office environment and may involve sitting at a computer or desk. A third type of work is a service worker ([[pink collar]]) whose labor is related to customer interaction, entertainment, sales or other service-oriented work. Many occupations blend blue, white, or pink industry categorizations.

Blue-collar work is often paid hourly [[wage|wage-labor]], although some professionals may be paid by the project or salaried.  There is a wide range of payscales for such work depending upon field of specialty and experience.

==Origin of term==
[[File:AlfredPalmerwelder1.jpg|thumb|260px|Welder making boilers for a ship, Combustion Engineering Company. Chattanooga, Tennessee, June 1942. Despite their name, blue-collar workers don't always or typically wear blue shirts.]]

The term ''blue collar'' was first used in reference to trades jobs in 1924, in an [[Alden, Iowa]] newspaper.&lt;ref&gt;Wickman, Forrest.  [http://www.slate.com/articles/business/explainer/2012/05/blue_collar_white_collar_why_do_we_use_these_terms_.html "Working Man's Blues:  Why do we call manual laborers blue collar?"] [[Slate.com]], 1 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;   The phrase stems from  the image of manual workers wearing blue [[denim]] or chambray shirts as part of their uniforms.&lt;ref&gt;Lynch, Annette and Mitchell D. Strauss, eds. (2014), ''Ethnic Dress in the United States: A Cultural Encyclopedia'', s.v. "Chambray,"  Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers; UK ed., p. 68. {{ISBN|978-0759121485}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Industrial and manual workers often wear durable canvas or cotton clothing that may be soiled during the course of their work. Navy and light blue colors conceal potential dirt or grease on the worker's clothing, helping him or her to appear cleaner. For the same reason, blue is a popular color for [[boilersuit]]s which protect workers' clothing. Some blue collar workers have uniforms with the name of the business and/or the individual's name embroidered or printed on it.

Historically, the popularity of the color blue among manual laborers contrasts with the popularity of white dress shirts worn by people in office environments. The blue collar/white collar color scheme has [[Social class|socio-economic class]] connotations. However, this distinction has become blurred with the increasing importance of [[skilled labour|skilled labor]], and the relative increase in low-paying white-collar jobs.

==Education requirements==
[[File:PV-Anlage Zugspitze Montage.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Workers constructing a [[photovoltaic system]].]]
Since many blue-collar jobs consist of mainly manual labor, educational requirements for workers are typically lower than those of white-collar workers.  Often, only a high school diploma is required, and many of the skills required for blue-collar jobs will be learned by the employee while working.  In higher level jobs, vocational training or apprenticeships may be required,  and for workers such as electricians and plumbers, state-certification is also necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://smallbusiness.chron.com/bluecollar-worker-whitecollar-worker-11074.html|title=What Is a Blue-Collar Worker and a White-Collar Worker?|access-date=2018-03-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Blue collar shift to developing nations==
{{See also|Deindustrialization}}
With the [[information revolution]], [[Western world|Western nations]] have moved towards a service and white collar economy. Many manufacturing jobs have been [[Offshoring|offshored]] to developing nations which pay their workers lower wages. This offshoring has pushed formerly [[agrarian nation]]s to industrialized economies and concurrently decreased the number of blue-collar jobs in developed countries.

In the [[United States]], '''blue collar and service occupations''' generally refer to jobs in precision production, craft, and repair occupations; machine operators and inspectors; transportation and moving occupations; handlers, equipment cleaners, helpers, and laborers.&lt;ref name="uslabor"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bls.gov/bls/glossary.htm|title=BLS Information |date=February 28, 2008|work=Glossary|publisher=U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics Division of Information Services |accessdate=2009-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Photo by Mona Mijthab, July 2011 (6349812257).jpg|thumb|Women work in a textile industry|Textile factory outside Dhaka, Bangladesh.]]

In the United States, an area known as the [[Rust Belt]] comprising the [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]] and [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]], including [[Western New York]] and [[Western Pennsylvania]], has seen its once large manufacturing base shrink significantly.  With the de-industrialization of these areas starting in the mid-1960s cities like [[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]]; [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]]; [[Buffalo, New York]]; [[Pittsburgh]], [[Pennsylvania]]; [[Erie, Pennsylvania]]; [[Youngstown, Ohio]]; [[Toledo, Ohio]], [[Rochester, New York]], and [[St. Louis]], [[Missouri]], have experienced a steady decline of the blue-collar workforce and subsequent population decreases. Due to this economic osmosis, the rust belt has experienced high unemployment, poverty, and urban blight.

==Automation and future==
[[File:Cargo loading, Operation Deep Freeze 2007 070208-N-4868G-323.JPEG|thumb|U.S. Navy sailors load a cargo container onto a container ship.]]

Due to many blue-collar jobs involving manual labor and relatively unskilled workers, automation poses a threat of unemployment for blue-collar workers.  One study from the MIT Technology Review estimates that 83% of jobs that make less than $20 per hour are threatened by automation.  Some examples of technology that threaten workers are self-driving cars and automated cleaning devices, which could place blue-collar workers such as truck drivers or janitors out of work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/603465/the-relentless-pace-of-automation/|title=Here’s how to use AI to make America great again|last=Rotman|first=David|work=MIT Technology Review|access-date=2018-03-17|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others have suggested that technological advancement will not lead to blue-collar job unemployment, but rather shifts in the types of work that blue-collar workers currently do.  Some foresee computer coding as becoming the blue-collar job of the future.  Proponents of this idea view coding as a skill that can be learned through vocational training, and suggest that more coders will be needed in a technologically advancing world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2017/02/programming-is-the-new-blue-collar-job/|title=The Next Big Blue-Collar Job Is Coding|work=WIRED|access-date=2018-03-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Others see future of blue-collar work as humans and computers working together to improve efficiency.  Such jobs would consist of data-tagging and labeling.

==Electoral politics==
Blue-collar workers have played a large role in electoral politics.  In the 2016 United States Presidential election, many attributed Donald Trump's victories in the states of Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Michigan to blue-collar workers, who overwhelmingly favored Trump over opponent Hillary Clinton.  Amongst white-working class citizens, Trump won 64% of the votes, compared to only 32% for Clinton.  This was the largest margin of victory amongst this group of voters for any presidential candidate since 1980.

Many attributed Trump's success amongst this bloc of voters to his opposition of international trade deals and environmental regulations, two of the largest threats to blue-collar employment.  Opponents of this view believe Trump's success with this bloc had more to do with an anti-immigrant and nationalist platform that supports deportation and discourages investment in higher education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/05/white-working-class-trump-cultural-anxiety/525771/|title=It Was Cultural Anxiety That Drove White, Working-Class Voters to Trump|last=Green|first=Emma|work=The Atlantic|access-date=2018-03-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adjective==
[[File:Municipal recycling facilities, Montgomery County, MD. 2007, Credit USEPA (14410405277).jpg|thumb|Workers in a materials recovery ([[recycling]]) facility in [[Montgomery County, Maryland]].]]
"Blue-collar" can be used as an adjective to describe the environment of the blue-collar worker such as a "blue-collar" neighborhood, [[restaurant]], or [[Bar (establishment)|bar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://experts.about.com/e/b/bl/Blue-collar_worker.htm |title=Blue Collar can also describe the environment |accessdate=2006-08-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120708031216/http://experts.about.com/e/b/bl/Blue-collar_worker.htm |archivedate=8 July 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Corporate finance}}
A '''business plan''' is a formal written document containing business goals, the methods on how these goals can be attained, and the time frame that these goals need to be achieved. It also describes the nature of the business, includes background information on the organization, the organization's financial projections, and the strategies it intends to implement to achieve stated targets. In its entirety, this document serves as a road map that provides direction to the business.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.entrepreneur.com/encyclopedia/business-plan|title=Business Plan Definition - Entrepreneur Small Business Encyclopedia|website=Entrepreneur|language=en|access-date=2018-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Written business plans are often required to obtain a bank loan or other kind of financing.

==Audience==

Business plans may be internally or externally focused.  Externally-focused plans draft goals that are important to outside stakeholders, particularly financial stakeholders.  These plans typically have detailed information about the organization or the team making effort to reach its goals.  With for-profit entities, external stakeholders include investors and customers,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smallbusinessnotes.com/planning/sbabusplan.html Small Business Notes] business plan outline for small    business start-up&lt;/ref&gt;  for non-profits, external stakeholders refer to donors and clients,&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20131105152438/http://ase.tufts.edu/yet/pdf/Non-Profit%20Incorporating%20%20The%20Business%20Plan.pdf Tufts University] non-profit business plan&lt;/ref&gt;  for government agencies, external stakeholders are the tax-payers, higher-level government agencies, and international lending bodies such as the [[International Monetary Fund]], the [[World Bank]], various economic agencies of the [[United Nations]], and [[Multilateral development bank|development banks]].

Internally-focused business plans target intermediate goals required to reach the external goals.   They may cover the development of a new product, a new service, a new IT system, a restructuring of finance, the refurbishing of a factory or a restructuring of the organization.  An internally-focused business plan is often developed in conjunction with a [[balanced scorecard]] or a list of critical success factors.  This allows success of the plan to be measured using non-financial measures.  

Business plans that identify and target internal goals, but provide only general guidance on how they will be met are called [[Strategic planning|strategic plans]].

Operational plans describe the goals of an internal organization, working group or department.&lt;ref&gt;[http://doa.louisiana.gov/opb/faf/OPFormatWord_FY01MWLayout.pdf State of Louisiana, USA]  government agency operational plan&lt;/ref&gt; Project plans, sometimes known as project frameworks, describe the goals of a particular project.  They may also address the project's place within the organization's larger strategic goals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.egovernment.tas.gov.au/themes/project_management/project_management/knowledge_base Tasmanian government project management knowledge base] government project plan {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090622211235/http://www.egovernment.tas.gov.au/themes/project_management/project_management/knowledge_base |date=June 22, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Content ==

Business plans are [[decision-making tools]].  The content and format of the business plan is determined by the goals and audience. For example, a business plan for a non-profit might discuss the fit between the business plan and the organization's mission.  Banks are quite concerned about defaults, so a business plan for a bank loan will build a convincing case for the organization's ability to repay the loan.  [[Venture capitalists]] are primarily concerned about initial investment, feasibility, and exit valuation.  A business plan for a project requiring equity financing will need to explain why current resources, upcoming growth opportunities, and [[sustainable competitive advantage]] will lead to a high exit valuation.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

Preparing a business plan draws on a wide range of knowledge from many different business disciplines: [[finance]], human resource management, [[intellectual property]] management, [[supply chain management]], operations management, and [[marketing]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bc.edu/schools/csom/mba/academics/bplan.html Boston College, Carroll School of Management, Business Plan Project] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080116051622/http://www.bc.edu/schools/csom/mba/academics/bplan.html |date=2008-01-16 }} The business school advises students that "To create a robust business plan, teams must take a comprehensive view of the enterprise and incorporate management-practice knowledge from every first-semester course." It is increasingly common for business schools to use business plan projects to provide an opportunity for students to integrate knowledge learned through their courses.&lt;/ref&gt;   It can be helpful to view the business plan as a collection of sub-plans, one for each of the main business disciplines.&lt;ref name="Eric S. Siegel 1993"&gt;Eric S. Siegel, Brian R. Ford, Jay M. Bornstein (1993), ''''The Ernst &amp; Young Business Plan Guide'''' (New York: John Wiley and Sons) {{ISBN|0-471-57826-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"... a good business plan can help to make a good business credible, understandable, and attractive to someone who is unfamiliar with the business. Writing a good business plan can’t guarantee success, but it can go a long way toward reducing the odds of failure." &lt;ref name="Eric S. Siegel 1993" /&gt;

== Presentation ==
{{Refimprove section|date=August 2012}}
The format of a business plan depends on its presentation context. It is common for businesses, especially start-ups, to have three or four formats for the same business plan.

An "[[elevator pitch]]" is a short summary of the plan's executive summary. This is often used as a teaser to awaken the interest of potential investors, customers, or strategic partners. It is called an elevator pitch as it is supposed to be content that can be explained to someone else quickly in an elevator. The elevator pitch should be between 30 and 60 seconds.&lt;ref name="inc magazine"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.inc.com/guides/2010/05/mastering-business-elevator-pitch.html|title=How to Master Your Elevator Pitch|accessdate=2014-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Sales presentation|pitch deck]] is a slide show and oral presentation that is meant to trigger discussion and interest potential investors in reading the written presentation.  The content of the presentation is usually limited to the executive summary and a few key graphs showing financial trends and key decision making benchmarks. If a new product is being proposed and time permits, a demonstration of the product may be included.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2012/01/07/pitchdeck/|title=How To Create An Early-Stage Pitch Deck For Investors|first=|last=Contributor|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A written presentation for external stakeholders is a detailed, well written, and pleasingly formatted plan targeted at external stakeholders.

An internal operational plan is a detailed plan describing planning details that are needed by management but may not be of interest to external stakeholders.  Such plans have a somewhat higher degree of candor and informality than the version targeted at external stakeholders and others.

== Revising the business plan ==

=== Cost overruns and revenue shortfalls ===

Cost and [[revenue]] estimates are central to any business plan for deciding the viability of the planned venture. But costs are often underestimated and revenues overestimated resulting in later cost overruns, revenue shortfalls, and possibly non-viability. During the [[dot-com bubble]] 1997-2001 this was a problem for many technology start-ups. [[Reference class forecasting]] has been developed to reduce the risks of cost overruns and revenue shortfalls and thus generate more accurate business plans.

==Legal and liability issues==

=== Disclosure requirements ===
An externally targeted business plan should list all legal concerns and financial liabilities that might negatively affect investors.  Depending on the amount of funds being raised and the audience to whom the plan is presented, failure to do this may have severe legal consequences.

=== Limitations on content and audience ===
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2015}}
[[Non disclosure agreement]]s (NDAs) with third parties, [[non-compete agreement]]s, conflicts of interest, privacy concerns, and the protection of one's [[trade secrets]] may severely limit the audience to which one might show the business plan.  Alternatively, they may require each party receiving the business plan to sign a contract accepting special clauses and conditions.

This situation is complicated by the fact that many venture capitalists will refuse to sign an NDA before looking at a business plan, lest it put them in the untenable position of looking at two independently developed look-alike business plans, both claiming originality.  In such situations one may need to develop two versions of the business plan: a stripped down plan that can be used to develop a relationship and a detail plan that is only shown when investors have sufficient interest and trust to sign an NDA.

==Open business plans==
Traditionally business plans have been highly confidential and quite limited in audience.
The business plan itself is generally regarded as secret.

An open business plan is a business plan with unlimited audience. The business plan is typically
web published and made available to all.

In the free software and open source business model, trade secrets, [[copyright]] and patents can no longer
be used as effective locking mechanisms to provide sustainable advantages to a particular business and therefore a secret business plan is less relevant in those models.

== Uses ==
*[[Education]]
**Business plans are used in some primary and secondary programs to teach economic principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=Economic Spa|url=http://www.economicspa.org/products.asp?cat=15&amp;hierarchy=02|title= Pennsylvania Business Plan Competition}} competition intended to teach economic principles to K-12 students&lt;/ref&gt;  
:*[[Wikiversity]] has a [[v:Lunar Boom Town|Lunar Boom Town]] project where students of all ages can collaborate with designing and revising business models and practice evaluating them to learn practical business planning techniques and methodology

*Fundraising
Fundraising is the primary purpose for many business plans, since they are related to the inherent probable success/failure of the company risk.
:*[[Angel investor]]s
:*[[Business loan]]s
:*[[Grant (money)|Grants]]
:*[[Startup company]] funding
:*[[Venture capital]]

*Internal use
:*[[Management by objectives]] (MBO) is a process of agreeing upon objectives (as can be detailed within business plans) within an organization so that management and employees agree to the objectives and understand what they are in the organization.
:*[[Strategic planning]] is an organization's process of defining its strategy, or direction, and making decisions on allocating its resources to pursue this strategy, including its capital and people. Business plans can help decision makers see how specific projects relate to the organization's strategic plan.
:*[[Total quality management]] (TQM) is a business management strategy aimed at embedding awareness of quality in all organizational processes. TQM has been widely used in manufacturing, education, call centers, government, and service industries, as well as NASA space and science programs.

==Not for profit businesses==
The business goals may be defined both for [[non-profit]]  or for-profit organizations.  For-profit business plans typically focus on financial goals, such as profit or creation of wealth.  Non-profit, as well as government agency business plans tend to focus on the "organizational mission" which is the basis for their governmental status or their non-profit, tax-exempt status, respectively—although non-profits may also focus on optimizing revenue.

The primary difference between profit and non-profit organizations is that "for-profit" organizations look to maximize wealth versus non-profit organizations, which look to provide a greater good to society. In non-profit organizations, creative tensions may develop in the effort to balance mission with "margin" (or revenue).

==Satires==
The business plan is the subject of many satires.  Satires are used both to express cynicism about business plans and as an educational tool to improve the quality of business plans.  For example,
* In his presentation, ''Five Criteria For a Successful Business Plan in Biotech'', Dr. Roger Bernier, uses ''[[Dilbert]]'' comic strips to remind people what ''not'' to do when researching and writing a business plan for a biotech start-up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.mta.ca/rendezvousbiosciences/day3panel-ppt/Roger%20Bernier.ppt |title=Five Criteria For a Successful Business Plan in Biotech |author=Bernier, Roger Laurent |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120106201111/http://www.mta.ca/rendezvousbiosciences/day3panel-ppt/Roger%20Bernier.ppt |archivedate=January 6, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;   
* Selena Maranjian's "Fool on the Hill" article in ''[[The Motley Fool]]'', "'South Park's' Investing Lesson" (November 8, 2001), references the "Underpants Gnomes" to illustrate the fallacy of focusing on goals without a clear implementation strategy. That "[[Gnomes (South Park)|Gnomes]]" episode satirizes the business plans of the [[Dot.com bubble|Dot-com era]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='South Park's' Investing Lesson|author=Maranjian, Selena|date=November 8, 2001|work=The Motley Fool|url=http://www.fool.com/news/foth/2001/foth011108.htm|access-date=2007-10-16|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/66ArVrcEB?url=http://www.fool.com/news/foth/2001/foth011108.htm#|archive-date=2012-03-15|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Chapter 26 of [[Neal Stephenson]]'s 1999 novel [[Cryptonomicon]] begins with the business plan of a fictional high tech company, satirizing both the writing style and the physical form of slickly produced business publications like business plans and [[annual report]]s.

'''Choi Tae-min''' (5 May 1912 – 1 May 1994) was the leader of a [[South Korea]]n [[cult]] combining elements of [[Buddhism]], [[Christianity]], and traditional [[Korean Shamanism]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/news/article/article.aspx?aid=3025424&amp;cloc=etc%7Cjad%7Cgooglenews|title=Shamanistic cult linked to president|publisher=|accessdate=26 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Choi, originally a [[Buddhist monk]], then a convert to [[Roman Catholic]]ism, was married six times. He was the mentor of the impeached South Korean president, [[Park Geun-hye]] (the daughter of former president [[Park Chung-hee]]), until his death in 1994. He allegedly used his relationship with Park to solicit bribes from government officials and businessmen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |title=South Korea's leader acknowledges ties to woman in scandal |url=http://www.foxnews.com/world/2016/10/25/south-korea-leader-acknowledges-ties-to-woman-in-scandal.html |date=25 October 2016 |newspaper=[[Fox News]] |access-date=28 October 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite news |last=Choe |first=Sang-hun |title=A Presidential Friendship Has Many South Koreans Crying Foul |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/28/world/asia/south-korea-choi-soon-sil.html?_r=0 |date=27 October 2016 |newspaper=[[New York Times]] |access-date=31 October 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In late 2016, a [[2016 South Korean political scandal|scandal]] involving his daughter, [[Choi Soon-sil]], broke out, with allegations that she too has exerted undue influence over President Park.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://english.hani.co.kr/arti/english_edition/e_national/667320.html|title=Pres.

== History ==
Choi Tae-min set up a religious group called [[Yongsae-gyo]] ({{lang|ko|영세교}}), or “Church of spirit world”, and declared himself [[Maitreya]], or a “Future Buddha.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://justgopoppi.com.br/2016/11/03/o-que-esta-acontecendo-na-coreia-sul-politica-seitas-e-corrupcao/ O que está acontecendo na Coreia do Sul: política, seitas e corrupção]&lt;/ref&gt; He befriended [[Park Geun-hye]] soon after her mother, [[Yuk Young-soo]], was assassinated in 1974. According to a report by the [[National Intelligence Service (South Korea)|Korean Central Intelligence Agency]] from the 1970s that was published by a South Korean news magazine in 2007, Choi initially approached Park Geun-hye by telling her that her mother had appeared to him in his dreams, asking him to help her daughter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://qz.com/821612/a-rasputinesque-mystery-woman-and-a-cultish-religion-could-take-down-south-koreas-president-park-geun-hye/|title=A Rasputinesque mystery woman and a cultish religion could take down South Korea’s president|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Choi was an associate of former-president President Park Chung-hee until the latter's death by assassination in 1979. [[Kim Jae-gyu]], the director of the [[KCIA]] who assassinated President Park Chung-hee, told a court that one of his motives was what he called the president’s failure to stop Choi Tae-min's corrupt activities and keep him away from his daughter.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In a newspaper interview in 2007, Park Geun-hye called Choi a patriot and said she was grateful for his counsel and comfort during “difficult times.” 

Also in 2007, a diplomatic cable made public through [[WikiLeaks]], the [[Embassy of the United States, Seoul|American Embassy in Seoul]] reported rumors that Mr. Choi, a 'Korean [[Grigori Rasputin|Rasputin]]', “had complete control over Park’s body and soul during her formative years and that his children accumulated enormous wealth as a result.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2016/10/28/2016102801342.html|title=Leaked U.S. Embassy Cable Warned of 'Rasputin' Behind Park|last=Lim|first=Min-hyuk|date=28 October 2016|newspaper=[[The Chosun Ilbo]]|access-date=28 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite document|last=Stanton|first=William|authorlink=William Stanton (diplomat)|coauthors=|title=ROK presidential election: Still the politics of the vortex|id={{WikiLeaks cable|07SEOUL2178_a}}|work=|publisher=[[WikiLeaks]]|date=20 July 2007|url=http://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/07SEOUL2178_a.html|format=|doi=|accessdate=28 October 2016|archiveurl=|archivedate=|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''colour trade mark''' (or '''color trademark''', see [[spelling differences]]) is a [[non-conventional trademark|non-conventional]] [[trade mark]] where at least one [[color|colour]] is used to perform the trade mark function of uniquely identifying the commercial origin of products or services. 

In recent times colours have been increasingly used as trade marks in the [[marketplace]]. However, it has traditionally been difficult to protect colours as trademarks through registration, as a colour as such was not considered to be a distinctive 'trademark'. This issue was addressed by the [[World Trade Organization]] [[Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights]],{{ref|TRIPs}} which broadened the legal definition of trademark to encompass "any sign...capable of distinguishing the goods or services of one undertaking from those of other undertakings" (article 15(1)).

Despite the recognition which must be accorded to colour trade marks in most countries, the ''graphical representation'' of such marks sometimes constitutes a problem for trademark owners seeking to protect their marks, and different countries have different methods for dealing with this issue.

This category of trade marks is distinguished from conventional (word or logo) trade marks that feature a specific colour or combination of colours; the latter category of trade marks present different legal issues.

==Registration of colour marks in different jurisdictions==

===Australia===
Requirements are set out in the ''Trade Marks Office Manual of Practice and Procedure'' issued by IP Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://xeno.ipaustralia.gov.au/D:/Exmanual/pt20_29/part21.htm#5|title=- IP Australia|publisher=Xeno.ipaustralia.gov.au|accessdate=29 November 2014}}{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===European Union===
In the [[European Union]], Article 4 of ''Council Regulation (EC) No. 40-94'' of 20 December 1993 ("signs of which a [[Community Trade Mark]] may consist") relevantly states that any CTM may consist of "any signs capable of being represented graphically...provided that such signs are capable of distinguishing the goods or services of one undertaking from those of other undertakings". In Libertel Groep v Benelux Merkenbureau (case C-104/01)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.copat.de/markenformen/c-104_01en.pdf|format=PDF|title=(Trade marks - Approximation of laws - Directive 89/104/EEC - Signs capable of constituting a trade mark- Distinctive character - Colour per se - Orange) |publisher=Copat.de|accessdate=29 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; dated May 6, 2003 the ECJ repeats the criteria from Sieckmann v German Patent Office (case C-273/00)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.copat.de/markenformen/C-273-00EN.pdf|format=PDF|title=(Trade marks - Approximation of laws - Directive 89/104/EEC - Signs of which a trade mark may consist - Distinctive character and graphic representability - Unsuitability of olfactory signs as trade marks)|publisher=Copat.de|accessdate=29 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; that graphical representation preferably means by images, lines or characters, and that the representation must be clear, precise, self-contained, easily accessible, intelligible, durable and objective.

This definition generally encompasses colour marks, and therefore an applicant for a CTM or a national trademark in the EC may define their colour trademark using an international colour code such as [[RAL (color space system)|RAL]] or [[Pantone]]. In most cases, a colour trademark will be registered only after an enhanced distinctiveness through use in the EC has been proved.

===United Kingdom===
In the [[United Kingdom]], trade marks consisting of colours or combinations of colours can be registered. However, an applicant's ability to register colour trade marks is limited by several considerations, in line with European Union jurisprudence. Thus, for example, while a trade mark described simply as a colour is registrable, a trade mark described as consisting "predominantly" of a particular colour is not. In a recent case, the High Court of Justice, Court of Chancery held that an application to register such a trade mark was permissible in ''[[Société des Produits Nestlé S.A. v. Cadbury UK Limited]]'' (2012), but on appeal the Court of Appeal reversed the decision in October 2014.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/oct/04/cadbury-dairy-milk-purple-trademark-blocked&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
In the [[United States]], the United States Court of Appeals ruled in 1985 that [[Owens Corning]] had the right to prevent competitors from using the colour [[pink]] in their insulation products, thus making Owens Corning the first company in the United States to trademark a colour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.colormatters.com/color-and-marketing/color-branding-legal-rights | title=Color Branding &amp; Trademark Rights | work=Color Matters | accessdate=January 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1995, the United States Supreme Court further acknowledged that a colour could be used as a trademark in the case of ''[[Qualitex Co. v. Jacobson Products Co., Inc.]]'', 514 U.S. 159 (1995).
The trademark owner must show that the trademark colour has acquired substantial distinctiveness, and the colour indicates source of the goods to which it is applied.

====Functionality bar====
The Lanham Act specifically states that "[n]o trademark by which the goods of the applicant may be distinguished from the goods of others shall be refused registration on the principal register on account of its nature unless it (e) Consists of a mark which (5) comprises any matter that, as a whole, is functional." {{USC|15|1052(e)(5)}}.
If a colour is held functional for any product, then it is not registrable or protectable as a trademark. 
Several U.S. Courts have dealt with the matter, and colours have been held functional for various purposes.
In [[Saint-Gobain Corp. v. 3M Co.]], 90 USPQ2d 1425 (TTAB 2007), the purple colour was considered functional for coated abrasives, because “[i]n the field of coated abrasives, color serves a myriad of functions, including color coding, and the need to color code lends support for the basic finding that color, including purple, is functional in the field of coated abrasives having paper or cloth backing.” [[Saint-Gobain Corp. v. 3M Co.]], 90 USPQ2d 1425, 1447 (TTAB 2007).
The [[Trademark Trial and Appeal Board]], in [[In re Ferris Corp.]], 59 USPQ2d 1587 (TTAB 2000), held that the colour pink for wound dressings was functional and not registrable, as its colour resembles human skin and was selected for this specific purpose.
In [[In re Orange Communications, Inc.]], 41 USPQ2d 1036 (TTAB 1996), the [[Trademark Trial and Appeal Board]] denied registration for the colours orange and yellow for public telephones and telephone booths, because it confers the goods better visibility under any lighting condition.
Also, the colour coral was held functional for earplugs, because it makes them easier to see in safety checks. [[In re Howard S. Leight &amp; Associates Inc.]], 39 USPQ2d 1058 (TTAB 1996).

====Aesthetical functionality bar====
In addition to the functionality bar, the colour cannot have an aesthetically functional purpose in order to be registrable or protected. In [[Brunswick Corp. v. British Seagull]], for example, the [[United States Patents and Trademark Office]]'s [[Trademark Trial and Appeal Board]] held that the black colour was not registrable for outboard motors:
"[A]lthough the color black is not functional in the sense that it makes these engines work better, or that it makes them easier or less expensive to manufacture, black is more desirable from the perspective of prospective purchasers because it is color compatible with a wider variety of boat colors and because objects colored black appear smaller than they do when they are painted other lighter or brighter colors. The evidence shows that people who buy outboard motors for boats like the colors of the motors to be harmonious with the colors of their vessels, and that they also find it desirable under some circumstances to reduce the perception of the size of the motors in proportion to the boats." [[British Seagull Ltd. v. Brunswick Corp.]], 28 USPQ 2d 1197, 1199 (1993).
Even though there is no direct function for the colour black in this case, protection was denied under the argument that consumers prefer it for aesthetic purposes.

A similar judgement was entered in [[Deere &amp; Co. v. Farmhand]]. Deere &amp; Co. tried to establish exclusive use of its John Deere green colour as a trademark, in order to enjoin Farmhand from applying it to its products. Although the John Deere green colour does not provide any specific function to the good to which it is applied, the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of Iowa|United States District Court for S.D. Iowa]] "found that farmers prefer to match their loaders to their tractor". Deere &amp; Co. v. Farmhand, Inc., 560 F. Supp. 85, 98 (U.S. Dist. Court S.D. Iowa, 1982). Therefore, if Deere &amp; Co. were awarded exclusive use of the John Deere green, its competitors would be in disadvantage because of reasons unrelated to the functional quality or price of its products.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6969">In [[economics]], the '''cost-of-production theory of value''' is the theory that the price of an object or condition is determined by the sum of the cost of the resources that went into making it. The cost can comprise any of the [[factors of production]] (including labor, capital, or land) and [[Effect of taxes and subsidies on price|taxation]].

The theory makes the most sense under assumptions of [[constant returns to scale]] and the existence of just one non-produced factor of production. These are the assumptions of the so-called [[non-substitution theorem]] {{clarify|date=April 2014}}. Under these assumptions, the long-run price of a commodity is equal to the sum of the cost of the inputs into that commodity, including interest charges.

==Historical development of theory==
Historically, the best-known proponent of such theories is probably [[Adam Smith]]. [[Piero Sraffa]], in his introduction to the [[Principles of Political Economy and Taxation|first volume of the "Collected Works of David Ricardo"]], referred to Smith's "adding-up" theory. Smith contrasted [[prices of production|natural prices]] with [[market price]]. Smith theorized that market prices would tend toward natural prices, where outputs would stand at what he characterized as the "level of effectual demand". At this level, Smith's natural prices of commodities are the sum of the natural rates of wages, profits, and rent that must be paid for inputs into production. (Smith is ambiguous about whether rent is price determining or price determined. The latter view is the consensus of later [[classical economics|classical economists]], with the Ricardo-Malthus-West theory of rent.)

[[David Ricardo]] mixed this cost-of-production theory of prices with the [[labor theory of value]], as that latter theory was understood by [[Eugen von Böhm-Bawerk]] and others. This is the theory that prices tend toward proportionality to the socially necessary labor embodied in a commodity. Ricardo sets this theory at the start of the first chapter of his ''[[Principles of Political Economy and Taxation]]''. He also refutes the labor theory of value in later sections of that chapter. Taknaga advances a new interpretation that Ricardo had cost-of-production theory of value from the start and presents a more coherent interpretation based on texts of ''[[Principles of Political Economy and Taxation]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Susumu_Takenaga?_sg=wZ0M45WMDO-NGFdnr86xTXB9yrOIWd6RUaG122hAOL8FC4cpcY59V7FV9KDk7WOStLcm8y1IxKyPo-f8wucSgQ Structure of the theory of value of David Ricardo]&lt;/ref&gt; This alleged refutation leads to what later became known as the [[transformation problem]]. [[Karl Marx]] later takes up that theory in the first volume of ''Capital'', while indicating that he is quite aware that the theory is untrue at lower levels of abstraction. This has led to all sorts of arguments over what both David Ricardo and Karl Marx "really meant". Nevertheless, it seems undeniable that all the major classical economics and Marx explicitly rejected the labor theory of price&lt;ref name="Gordon"&gt;Donald F. Gordon, "What was the Labor Theory of Value", ''American Economic Review Papers and Proceedings'', V. 49, n. 2 (May 1959): 462–472&lt;/ref&gt;([https://www.jstor.org/stable/1816138]).

A somewhat different theory of cost-determined prices is provided by the "[[Neo-Ricardianism|neo-Ricardian School]]" [http://homepage.newschool.edu/~het/schools/neoric.htm] of [[Piero Sraffa]] and his followers. Shiozawa presented a modern interpretation of Ricardo's cost-of-production theory of value.&lt;ref&gt;Shiozawa, Y. (2016) The revival of classical theory of values, in Nobuharu Yokokawa et als. (Eds.) ''The Rejuvenation of Political Economy'', May 2016, Oxon and New York: Routledge. Chapter 8, pp.151-172.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Polish economist [[Michał Kalecki]] [http://homepage.newschool.edu/~het/profiles/kalecki.htm] distinguished between sectors with "cost-determined prices" (such as manufacturing and services) and those with "demand-determined prices" (such as agriculture and raw material extraction).

==Market price==
{{main|Market price}}
Market price is a familiar economic concept: it is the price that a good or service is offered at, or will fetch, in the marketplace. It is of interest mainly in the study of microeconomics. Market value and market price are equal only under conditions of market efficiency, equilibrium, and [[rational expectations]].

In economics, ''returns to scale'' and ''economies of scale'' are related terms that describe what happens as the scale of production increases. They are different, non-interchangeable concepts.

==Labor theory of value==
{{main|Labor theory of value}}
The labor theories of value are economic theories according to which the true values of commodities are related to the labor needed to produce them.

There are many accounts of labor value, with the common element that the "value" of an exchangeable good or service is, or ought to be, or tends to be, or can be considered as, equal or proportional to the amount of labor required to produce it (including the labor required to produce the raw materials and machinery used in production).

Different labor theories of value prevailed among classical economists through the mid-19th century. This theory is especially associated with Adam Smith and David Ricardo. Since that time, it has been most often associated with Marxian economics, while among modern mainstream economists it is considered to be superseded by the marginal utility approach.

==Taxes and subsidies==
[[File:Tax supply and demand.svg|thumbnail|200px|right|A [[supply and demand]] diagram illustrating taxes' effect on prices.]] 
{{main|Effect of taxes and subsidies on price}}
[[Tax]]es and [[subsidy|subsidies]] change the price of goods and services. A marginal tax on the sellers of a good will shift the supply curve to the left until the vertical distance between the two supply curves is equal to the per unit tax; other things remaining equal, this will increase the [[price]] paid by the consumers (which is equal to the new market price) and decrease the price received by the sellers. Marginal subsidies on production will shift the supply curve to the right until the vertical distance between the two supply curves is equal to the per unit subsidy; other things remaining equal, this will decrease price paid by the consumers (which is equal to the new market price) and increase the price received by the producers.

}}'''Driver Reifen und KFZ-Technik''' is a German company  providing tire and car services. Since 1994, the company has been part of the Italian tire manufacturer [[Pirelli]] and is a 100% subsidiary of ''Deutsche Pirelli Reifen Holding GmbH''. The company has more than 80 stores in Germany operating under several brand names including ''Pneumobil, Driver,'' and ''Reifen-Wagner''. It employs approximately 500 people and had revenues of approx. €100 million in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation/core|Surname1=Echo Zeitungen GmbH|Title=Pneumobil kauft zu|language=German|URL=http://www.echo-online.de/wirtschaft/wirtschaft-suedhessen/pneumobil-kauft-zu_17976272.htm|AccessDate=2017-09-27
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company’s service offering includes tires, rims, high-quality car services and car accessories for almost all types of vehicles. The company is headquartered in Breuberg in the Odenwald region, on the factory premises of Pirelli Deutschland GmbH.

== History ==
The company was established in 1979 and acquired by the Pirelli Group in 1994. After taking over, among others, the branches of Reifen Laupichler in the metropolitan area of Hamburg and Hanover the company, then named Pneumobil GmbH, acquired the tire retailers Junginger of Metzingen and Reifen Herl of [[Nürtingen]] with a total of 15 stores on 1 November 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation/core|Periodical=Reifenpresse|Title=Jetzt auch offiziell: Herl und Junginger zu Pneumobil|Date=2003-10-31|language=German|URL=http://reifenpresse.de/2003/10/31/jetzt-auch-offiziell-herl-und-junginger-zu-pneumobil/|AccessDate=2017-09-27
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Effective 1 January 2012, Christian F. Mühlhäuser took the helm of Pneumobil succeeding Hans-Ulrich Röske who had gone into early retirement after working more than 40 years for Pirelli Deutschland.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation/core|Surname1=Vogel Business Media GmbH &amp; Co.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mühlhäuser joined Pirelli as a working student in 1993. Later, after studying engineering and obtaining an MBA degree at US universities, he assumed management functions in the areas of logistics and planning, quality and technology, and in Pirelli‘s headquarters in Milan. In 2009, he took the helm of the Pirelli motorcycle tire factory in Breuberg. 
[[File:Pneumobil_Niederlassung_Stuttgart-Weilimdorf.jpg|thumb|Pneumobil branch Stuttgart-Weilimdorf]]
Pneumobil went on to acquire more companies such as Reifen Blank of [[Düren]] on 1 August 2013 &lt;ref&gt;{{citation/core|Periodical=Reifenpresse|Title=Pneumobil weiter auf Einkaufstour|Date=2013-08-06|language=German|URL=http://reifenpresse.de/2013/08/06/pneumobil-weiter-auf-einkaufstour/|AccessDate=2017-09-27

}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, Pneumobil obtained possession of Reifen-Wagner R.W. Auto-Technik, a [[Landshut]]-based company offering specialized tire retail and car services. The 100 employees of Reifen-Wagner were kept on the payroll and the service network with a total of ten workshops exclusively based in the state of Bavaria was also taken over.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pneumobil kauft Reifen Wagner - autohaus.de|periodical=|publisher=|url=http://www.autohaus.de/nachrichten/reifenhandel-kfz-service-pneumobil-kauft-reifen-wagner-1279454.html|deadurl=|accessdate=2017-09-27|archiveurl=|archivedate=|last=|date=|year=|month=|day=|language=German|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation/core|Surname1=Vogel Business Media GmbH &amp; Co.

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 September 2013, Pneumobil opened its first ''Driver Center'' in [[Frankfurt]]. A combination of show room, design lounge, consultation room, sales and service area, these flagship stores are designed to turn “purchasing tires and car services into an experience.”&lt;ref&gt;{{citation/core|Periodical=Reifenpresse|Title=In Frankfurt errichtet Pirelli ein „Driver Center“|Date=2013-08-02|language=German|URL=http://reifenpresse.de/2013/08/02/in-frankfurt-errichtet-pirelli-ein-driver-center/|AccessDate=2017-09-27

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 April 2017, Pneumobil GmbH changed its name to Pneumobil Reifen und KFZ-Technik GmbH by registering the new name in trade register B of the local court of [[Darmstadt]]. Shortly afterwards, on 1 July 2017, the Cologne-based tire retailer Reifen Schäfer e.K. was taken over by Pneumobil.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation/core|Periodical=Reifenpresse|Title=Reifen Schäfer aus Köln geht an Pneumobil|Date=2017-06-19|language=German|URL=http://www.reifenpresse.de/2017/06/19/reifen-schaefer-aus-koeln-geht-an-pneumobil/|AccessDate=2017-09-27

[[File:Reifen-Wagner_Ingolstadt.jpg|thumb|Pneumobil branch Ingolstadt]]
After a redesign of six Pneumobil stores in the area of Frankfurt and two Reifen-Wagner stores in Munich, there are 21 Driver Centers (as of October 2017) which are all 100% property of Pneumobil Reifen und KFZ-Technik GmbH. In addition, there are other Driver Centers in the network of Pneumobil’s sister company ''Driver Handelssysteme GmbH'' which is also a subsidiary of ''Deutsche Pirelli Reifen Holding GmbH''. 

At the end of September 2017, the former Reifen Wagner branch in Hanauerstr. 42, Munich was reopened as the Driver Center Munich. The first European P-Zero World of the Pirelli Group was also formed within this Driver Center.

{{About|the US naval rating|the general occupation|Electronics technician|the occupation in several armed forces|Electronics technician (armed forces)}}

The [[United States Navy]] job [[Naval rating|rating]] of '''Electronics Technician''' (abbreviated as '''ET''') is a designation given by the Bureau of Naval Personnel ([[BUPERS]]) to enlisted members who satisfactorily complete initial Electronics Technician "A" school training.

==History of the Electronics Technician rating==

{{Infobox Military rating
|name= Electronics technician
|image=[[File:Rating Badge ET.jpg|125px]]
|caption= Rating insignia
|issued_by= [[United States Navy]]
|type= Enlisted rating
|abbreviation= ET
|specialty= Technical
|Disestablished=29 September 2016}}

===WWII era===
The Electronics Technician (abbreviated as ET) rating was originally established as Radio Technician (abbreviated as RT) in April 1942 during the height of [[World War II]]. The story of their training may be found at "Solving the Naval Radar Crisis" by Raymond C Watson, Jr. Trafford Publishing 2007 {{ISBN|978-1-4251-6884-1}}. 
The rating insignia adopted was that of the established [[Radioman]] (abbreviated as RM) rating, and remained until October 1945, when the rating name was changed to Electronic Technician's Mate (abbreviated as ETM). In 1948, the Navy changed the name of the rating to Electronics Technician, and a new rating insignia was created.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.navy.mil/research/library/online-reading-room/title-list-alphabetically/c/enlisted-ratings-in-u-s-navy-1775-1969.html |title=Compilation of Enlisted Ratings and Apprenticeships, U.S. Navy, 1775 to 1969 |publisher=History.navy.mil |date= |accessdate=2012-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Vietnam era to present===
In 1971 the [[Radarman]] (abbreviated as RD) rating was disestablished. Former Radarmen, depending on their training, were placed in to the either the established Electronic Technician (ET) rating or either of the newly established [[Operations specialist (United States Navy)|Operations Specialist]] (abbreviated as OS) or Electronic Warfare Technician (abbreviated as EW) ratings.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.navycs.com/navy-jobs/operations-specialist.html&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 1, 1998 the [[Data systems technician|Data Systems Technicians]] (abbreviated as DS) rating was disestablished. Former Data Systems Technicians were, depending on their training, placed in to either the Electronics Technician or [[Fire controlman|Fire Controlman]] (abbreviated as FC) rating.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.navydads.com/forum/topics/discontinued-and-changed&lt;/ref&gt;

===Creation of the service ratings ET, ETR, ETV, and ETN===

On November 3, 2015 a mostly administrative change was made to the general ET rating. Electronics Technicians who volunteered for submarine duty where redesignated as either Electronics Technician, Submarine, Communications (abbreviated as ETR) or Electronics Technician, Submarine, Navigation (abbreviated as ETV). Nuclear Power trained Electronics Technicians were redesignated as Electronics Technicians, Nuclear Power (abbreviated as ETN). Electronics Technicians serving in the service rating Electronics Technician (ET) remained designed as Electronics Technician (ET). Electronics Technician (ET) is sometimes abbreviated as ETSW when it is necessary to distinguish ET from ETR, ETV, and ETN. All three new ratings as well as the original Electronics Technician rating use the same Electronics Technician rating insignia.&lt;ref name="NAVADMIN 261/15" /&gt;

The reason for the change is because even those these four service ratings (ET, ETR, ETV, and ETN) fall under the same general rating (ET), share a common history, have similar names and share the same rating insignia the enlistment requirements, initial 'A' school training, specialized 'C' school training, job assignments (billets), specific qualification, and community managers are unique to each of the four service rating. This prevents someone trained in any of the four service rating from easily transferring to another of the four service rating without first going through significant retraining and qualification that would be required by anyone transferring from any of the other general rating in the Navy.&lt;ref name="NAVADMIN 261/15" /&gt;

===Elimination of all Naval Ratings===
On September 29, 2016 the Navy moved away from traditional ratings to an alphanumeric system of Navy Occupational Specialty (NOS) codes. The ET-related NOS codes were: for ET, B420; for ETR, C126; for ETV, C121; for ETN, D110, D111, or D112. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.public.navy.mil/bupers-npc/reference/messages/Documents/NAVADMINS/NAV2016/NAV16218.txt |title=NAVADMIN 16218 |publisher=navy.mil |date= |accessdate=2016-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 21, 2016 however, after months of widespread complaints, Chief of Naval Operations John Richardson released a message announcing a restoration of all U.S. Navy Ratings.

==== Electronics Technician Navy Enlisted Classifications ====
The [[Navy Enlisted Classification]] (NEC) system supports the enlisted rating structure in identifying personnel and billets in manpower authorizations. NEC codes identify a non-rating wide skill, knowledge, aptitude, or qualification that must be documented to identify both people and billets for management purposes.  The most current information regarding NECs can be found in the Navy [http://www.public.navy.mil/bupers-npc/reference/nec/NECOSVolII/Pages/default.aspx NEOCS Manual.]

After 'A' school and between duty assignments ETs will attend advanced 'C' school training. These 'C' school give the ET advanced training in the specific systems that will be required to maintain and repair at their next duty assignment.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cool.navy.mil/usn/enlisted/rating_info_cards/et.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

There are 62 ET-related NECs.&lt;ref name="NEOCS Manual"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.public.navy.mil/bupers-npc/reference/nec/NECOSVolII/Pages/default.aspx|title = Navy NEOCS Manual|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Electronics Technician Nuclear Power (ETN) ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2016}}
Nuclear-trained ETNs perform duties in nuclear propulsion plants primarily in operating, maintaining, and repairing reactor instrumentation and control systems. ETNs may be assigned as an operator to a nuclear-powered [[aircraft carriers|aircraft carrier]], as an instructor at a Navy nuclear power training command, or as a [[technician]] at a [[shipyard]] or other nuclear support facility.  Additionally ETNs may volunteer for nuclear [[submarine]] service.  ETNs are the only rating in the Navy that can qualify as a [[reactor operator]] of a [[Nuclear marine propulsion|naval nuclear propulsion plant]].

==== Training ====
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2016}}
ETNs complete several different phases of training in order to be able to operate a naval nuclear propulsion plant.  In order to be selected for nuclear training prospective Navy recruits must have a high enough cutscore on the [[ASVAB|Armed Service Vocational Battery]] (ASVAB) that score being greater than 88 and the [[Navy Advanced Placement Test]] (NAPT) that score being greater than 55%.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}  Prospective nuclear recruits are then sent to Navy boot camp where prospective nuclear trainees are selected in a 50-30-20 ratio to be trained as nuclear [[Machinist's Mate|machinist's mates]], nuclear [[electricians|electrician's mate]], or nuclear electronics technicians.  Those who are selected to be nuclear electronics technicians then enter the Navy Nuclear Pipeline to train to become an ETN.

In the first stage of training in the Navy Nuclear Pipeline, prospective ETNs are trained for six months at the Nuclear Field 'A' School (NFAS) at the [[Naval Nuclear Power Training Command]] (NNPTC) in [[Goose Creek, SC]].  The curriculum at NFAS includes a mathematics refresher course, basic electronics theory, analog electronics theory (EFUNDS), digital electronics theory, and instrumentation and control equipment (I&amp;CE) theory and maintenance.  The curriculum is presented in a high paced manner that ramps up over the term at NFAS in order to prepare students for the difficulties of [[Naval Nuclear Power School|Nuclear Power School]].  The curriculum is very similar to that which is presented to nuclear electricians except that nuclear electricians train in electrical motor and generator theory and maintenance instead of I&amp;CE theory and maintenance.  Due to the specialized training given at NFAS, ETNs who have trained there instead of another ET 'A' school are not qualified to be assigned to billets designed for non-nuclear ETs. Personnel who are disqualified from Navy nuclear work ('de-nuked') or who fail to qualify for Navy nuclear work later in the pipeline are reclassified and retrained into another rating in order to remain in the Navy. ETN is not eligible for direct conversion to ET. This means that for an ETN to become and ET they must attend the ET 'A' school.

In the second stage of training in the Navy Nuclear Pipeline, ETNs are trained for six months at the Nuclear Power School at the NNPTC.  The curriculum for ETNs at the Nuclear Power School includes a higher level mathematics (Calculus) refresher course, introduction to nuclear propulsion systems, Navy nuclear mechanical, electrical, and electronics system design, reactor theory, health physics, basic materials science, and chemistry as it applies to nuclear power plants.  The curriculum is similar for MMNs, EMNs, and ETNs, except that each rating focuses more on their particular nuclear system design (for nuclear ETNs this means that they have additional training in nuclear electronics design).

In the third and final stage of training in the Navy Nuclear Pipeline, ETNs are trained for six months at one of four Navy [[nuclear prototype training units]] (NPTUs).  Two NPTUs are moored training ships (MTS) using [[S5W]] reactors located at the [[Naval Weapons Station Charleston|Naval Weapons Station]] in Charleston, SC., and two additional NPTUs are land-based prototype units using a [[S7G]] reactor and a [[S8G]] reactor located in [[Saratoga Springs, NY]].  The curriculum for ETNs at an NPTU includes detailed health physics training, design, operation, and maintenance of electronics systems for the NPTU, nuclear watchstanding procedures, and nuclear casualty procedures.  Unlike the first two stages of the Navy Nuclear Pipeline where the curriculum is presented in a typical classroom format, training at an NPTU is self-motivated training where students are required to research different aspects of a nuclear propulsion plant design, operation, or theory and demonstrate this knowledge in an oral interview with a qualified nuclear instructor.  Additionally, ETNs must perform graded watches under the instruction of a qualified nuclear instructor where they operate a particular piece of nuclear equipment or respond to a casualty.  The culmination of training for an ETN is an oral board where an ETN must demonstrate the knowledge of all procedures, equipment, theory expected for a nuclear reactor operator.  Completion of NPTU qualifies an ETN to stand watch on the NPTU or to train to operate nuclear propulsion plants on a nuclear aircraft carrier or submarine.  Additionally, it gives the individual the ETN [[Navy Enlisted Classification]] (NEC), and the individual is then said to be "nuclear qualified."

Upon completion of the Naval Nuclear Pipeline, most nuclear qualified ETNs are sent to nuclear aircraft carriers or nuclear submarines.  On a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, ETNs are sent to a nuclear training division where they train to qualify to operate the nuclear reactors of the ship in a similar way to NPTU for about six months prior to being sent to a reactor control division.  In contrast, on a submarine ETNs are directly assigned to the Reactor Controls division and are directed to qualify different watches incrementally.  Due to the smaller number of personnel on a nuclear submarine, ETNs must also cross qualify on several nuclear electrician watches.  Since ETNs are required to stand watches, perform maintenance, and train and qualify on additional submarine systems, it is not uncommon for it to take over 12 months for an ETN to become fully qualified as a reactor operator, shutdown reactor operator, and all intermediate watches.  Upon subsequent transfer to an NPTU or another nuclear ship, operators are required to re-qualify the same watches in only about 6 months.

Even upon completion of being fully qualified on all ETN watches ("qualified in rate"), additional proficiency and casualty training is required for all ETNs.  On a ship this generally includes general Engineering or Reactor Department training, Reactor Controls division training, periodic exams and interviews, monitored maintenance and operations, periodic watch re-qualifications, and monitored tactical or casualty drills.

Usually after an ETN is "fully qualified" the individual is sent to an "in-rate" technical school [[ETMS]] where the technician studies electronic troubleshooting and repair on shipboard equipment.  Completion of this school allows the technician to be designated with the NEC 3373.

Senior ETNs (typically those who hold the rank of [[petty officer first class]] (E-6) or higher) are expected to qualify for senior supervisory watches.  Self-motivated training for this includes the detailed operations of all nuclear systems on a ship (not just the ETN specific parts) focusing on the big picture view of nuclear operations and casualty response.  The training time required to qualify for senior supervisory watches depends on the individual.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5437">'''Ferdinand Osvald Conrad Anker''' (12 December 1876 – 23 April 1954) was a [[Norway|Norwegian]] businessperson.

==Pre-war career==
Anker was born in [[Oslo|Christiania]], attended commerce school and resided in [[Germany]] and [[France]] between 1897 and 1899. In 1899 he started his own company, trading in iron, steel and other construction metals. He later expanded the company with the selling of [[agricultural machinery]]. In 1910 he abandoned the company he had started in order to take the head job of [[P. Schreiner sen. &amp; Co]], a company ran by his father beforehand.&lt;ref name=merkbio&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|editor-last=Hoffstad|editor-first=Einar|editor-link=Einar Hoffstad|title=Anker, F(erdinand)|encyclopedia=[[Merkantilt biografisk leksikon]]|publisher=Yrkesforlaget|location=Oslo|year=1935|page=34|url=http://runeberg.org/merkbio/0108.html|language=Norwegian|accessdate=5 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anker became a board member of [[Kværner Brug]] in 1910, and advanced to chairman in 1914. He also chaired [[Myrens Verksted]], [[Moss Værft &amp; Dokk]], Landbruk Maskin (in both Oslo and Florø), A/S Staal &amp; Jern and Jernmetal.&lt;ref name=merkbio/&gt; He was a main shareholder in Landbruk Maskin, Staal &amp; Jern and Jernmetal, and a board member of [[Elektrisk Bureau]],&lt;ref name=lagmann&gt;{{cite news|title=Saken mot Ferdinand Anker for lagmannsrett|date=5 September 1946|work=[[Verdens Gang]]|page=5|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; supervisory council member of [[Nationaltheatret]] and [[Christiania Bank og Kreditkasse]], and also chaired two philanthropical institutions run by his family. Heavily engaged in politics, Anker was a member of the financial committee of the [[Conservative Party (Norway)|Conservative Party]]'s central board from 1909 to 1916. From 1925 he chaired the [[employers' association]] Jerngrossistenes Forening.&lt;ref name=merkbio/&gt;

==Second World War and later life==
In February 1946 Anker was arrested together with the office manager in P. Schreiner sen. &amp; Co, on suspicion of "economic treason", as a part of the [[legal purge in Norway after World War II]].

Anker pleaded not guilty, and referred to his office manager who handled the daily affairs.&lt;ref name=lagmann2/&gt; He was found not guilty of the spike deliverance. In spite of this, he was found guilty of high treason, and sentenced to one year of prison and a {{NOK|3 million|link=yes}} fine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Anker fikk 1 års lengsel og 3 millioners bot|date=24 September 1946|work=Verdens Gang|page=1|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{as of|2011}}, This represents about {{NOK|54,4 million}} in currency (about {{USD|10 million|link=yes}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ssb.no/vis/kpi/kpiregn.html|title=Konsumprisindeksen|publisher=[[Statistics Norway]]|language=Norwegian|accessdate=10 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1950 Anker was sued, as chairman of Moss Værft &amp; Dokk, by [[Øivind Lorentzen]]'s company Sobral. Sobral claimed that Moss Værft &amp; Dokk negliged their contract agreement regarding the construction of two vessels during the war. First, claimed Sobral, Moss Værft &amp; Dokk had instead used their capacity on arming whaling vessels. The two vessels had been delayed, and when they were completed, they had been taken over by ''Kriegsmarine'' as [[Minesweeper (ship)|minesweeper]]s. The court case lasted several years, reaching the Court of Appeal in 1954.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Erstatningskrav på 7 mill kroner mot Moss Værft &amp; Dokk|date=20 February 1950|work=Verdens Gang|page=1|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Millionsak i Lagmannsretten|date=16 February 1954|work=Verdens Gang|page=10|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anker was decorated as a Commander, Second Class of the [[Royal Order of the Lion (Belgium)|Belgian Royal Order of the Lion]] before the Second World War.&lt;ref name=merkbio/&gt; He died in April 1954 and was buried at [[Vestre gravlund]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.disnorge.no/gravminner/vis.php?mode=x|title=Cemeteries in Norway|publisher=DIS-Norge|language=Norwegian|accessdate=8 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gainsborough Studios''' is a 1908 building located at 222 [[Central Park South]] in Manhattan, New York City. The 16-story building contains 34 artist's studios, each unit features double height, 18 foot ceilings with double height windows facing north and overlooking [[Central Park]]. A well-heeled artist rented each studio as working space, primarily producing oil portraits for well-heeled patrons.

The building was designed as a combination studio and living space for artists, featuring shared kitchen areas, a laundry, and a private dining room, as well as a reception area for clients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Zimmer|first1=Lori|title=Gainsborough Studios|url=http://art-nerd.com/newyork/gainsborough-studios/|website=art-nerd.com|publisher=Art Nerd New York|accessdate=21 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The facade features a bust of the English painter [[Thomas Gainsborough]], a [[bas-relief]], or [[frieze]], ''Procession of the Arts'', by [[Isidore Konti]], and a tile mural by [[Henry Chapman Mercer]] and his [[Moravian Pottery and Tile Works]].&lt;ref name="DolkartLandmarks"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dolkart|first1=Andrew|title=Guide to New York City Landmarks|date=2008|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=0470289635|page=128}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The architects were Herbert Harde and R. Thomas Short, originally named Herbert Spencer Steinhardt (born about 1873) and Richard Thomas Short (born about 1870), each had shortened his name. Together they formed the well-known New York architectural firm, [[Harde &amp; Short]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Grey|first1=Christopher|title=2 Architects' Brief Journey Into Design Pyrotechnics|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/04/realestate/2-architects-brief-journey-into-design-pyrotechnics.html|accessdate=21 February 2018|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=2 December 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''High Pay Centre''' is a [[United Kingdom|UK]] [[think tank]] carrying out [[research]] and analysis on issues relating to top [[income]]s, [[corporate governance]], and [[business performance management|business performance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://highpaycentre.org/about|title=About - High Pay Centre|website=Highpaycentre.org|accessdate=4 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Centre is generally critical of existing top pay practices, and advocates policies designed to reduce [[economic inequality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://highpaycentre.org/pubs/reform-agenda-how-to-make-top-pay-fairer|title=Reform Agenda: How to make top pay fairer - Publications - High Pay Centre|website=Highpaycentre.org|accessdate=4 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; HPC research and commentary on high pay and [[pay inequities|inequality]] are regularly cited in the [[UK media]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://highpaycentre.org/press|title=Press - High Pay Centre|website=Highpaycentre.org|accessdate=4 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2014, the Centre has promoted 'fatcat day', usually occurring in the first week of January, marking the date on which the earnings for the average FTSE 100 Chief Executive surpasses the amount that the average UK worker can expect to earn all year.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jan/04/fat-cat-thursday-top-bosses-earn-workers-annual-salary-by-lunchtime&lt;/ref&gt;

The Centre was established by [[Compass (think tank)|Compass]] in 2009 as the High Pay Commission, and changed its name to the High Pay Centre following publication of the final report of the Commission.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.compassonline.org.uk/action/campaigns/high-pay-commission-for-a-just-and-sustainable-economy/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Hotel Management''''' magazine is a [[Trade journal|trade publication]] produced by Questex, LLC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=HotelWorld To Debut in Las Vegas September 18-20, 2007|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/hotelworld-to-debut-in-las-vegas-september-18-20-2007-56463207.html|accessdate=25 April 2017|work=PR Newswire|date=20 November 2006|location=Newton}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==History and profile==
The magazine ''Hotel Management'' was established in New York in 1922 by Ahrens Publishers.  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Announcing a "Made-to-Measure" Magazine|journal=Hotel Management|date=February 1922|volume=1|issue=1|page=1|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.c2535285;view=1up;seq=9|accessdate=8 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It absorbed or merged with various other hotel management magazines over the years, including ''Hotel World'', which had been established in 1875.  The magazine sometimes took on other names such as ''Hotel &amp; Motel Management''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Martin Scarrott|title=Sport, Leisure and Tourism Information Sources|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LHIABAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA96|accessdate=25 April 2017|date=3 November 2009|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-36455-6|page=96}}&lt;/ref&gt;, reflecting these mergers or changes in the market.

The magazine delivered hotel news, analysis and operational strategies. Regular features included special reports, research/top lists, hot products, technology, furniture, fixtures and equipment, hotel operations, and trends and statistics. Later owners included Advanstar Communications, Inc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=All editions for 'Hotel &amp; motel management'|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/hotel-motel-management/oclc/1681167/editions?referer=di&amp;editionsView=true|work=WorldCat|accessdate=25 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Hadyn Ingram|title=Business of Hotels|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QC3cTxSAhCsC&amp;pg=PA203|accessdate=25 April 2017|date=7 June 2007|publisher=Routledge|isbn=1-136-35944-3|page=203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2011, the magazine was redesigned and renamed ''Hotel Management''.&lt;ref name=fol&gt;{{cite news|author=Jason Fell|title=Questex Renames, Redesigns Hotel &amp; Motel Management|url=http://www.foliomag.com/questex-renames-redesigns-hotel-motel-management/|accessdate=25 April 2017|work=Folio:|date=12 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following these changes the magazine began to cover articles about [[technology]], development and trends/statistics.&lt;ref name=fol/&gt; It is published fifteen times a year.&lt;ref name=fol/&gt; It was formerly published 21 times per year.&lt;ref name=trat&gt;{{cite book|title=Travel and Tourism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SmMcHkpviiAC&amp;pg=PT187|accessdate=25 April 2017|year=2010|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=978-0-8160-8078-6|page=187}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its headquarters is in [[New York City]].&lt;ref name=trat/&gt;

[[File:Kari-Kairamo-1976.jpg|thumb|right|Kari Kairamo in 1976.]]
'''Kari Antero Oswald Kairamo''', titled ''[[Vuorineuvos]]'' (31 December 1932  [[Helsinki]] in [[Finland]], &amp;ndash; 11 December 1988 in [[Espoo]], [[Finland]]), was a Chairman and CEO of [[Nokia|Nokia Corporation]] and a significant and popular person in the industry, who was also actively involved in [[Finland]]'s foreign policy.

==Biography==

===Career===
Kari Kairamo had a master's degree in engineering (wood processing). Early on in his career, he had leading positions in several international firms in the paper industry. Nokia hired him in 1967, when it was still a major player in the forest industry. In 1977, Kairamo became CEO of Nokia after [[Björn Westerlund]] retired. Kairamo's mission was to build Nokia fast into an internationally large multi-industry company, and he led several courageous [[Mergers and acquisitions|acquisitions]] for the company.

The late 1980s was a very special period of time both for the Nokia Corporation and for Finland. The place Finland occupied on the map of [[Europe]] was about to change, and cold war and protectionism in the Finnish trade politics was about to break down. Kairamo saw the importance of Nokia, the biggest company in Finland, as a major agent in getting Finland closer to Western Europe, although at the same time he considered the [[Soviet Union]] to be an important trade partner and managed to retain close relations with major Soviet politicians and business leaders.

===Death===
Kari Kairamo committed [[suicide]] by hanging himself in his home on 11 December 1988, an act which Nokia at first attempted to hide. His sudden death by his own hand only served to strengthen his already legendary image. He had endless amount of energy and a stunning work efficiency. Suffering from [[bipolar disorder]] is also a commonly suspected reason for his tragic decision. As he was part of the Kihlman family, famous for their artists, some people close to the family suspect he was manic-depressive like many great artists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cord|first=David|title=[[The Decline and Fall of Nokia]]|date=April 2014|publisher=Schildts &amp; Söderströms|location=Helsinki|isbn=978-951-52-3320-2|page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Khyberpassrifles.jpg|thumb|240px|Copies of British [[Martini–Henry|Martini]] and Snider firearms built in the Khyber region]]
A '''Khyber Pass copy''' is a firearm manufactured by cottage gunsmiths in the [[Khyber Pass]] region between [[Pakistan]] and [[Afghanistan]].

The area has long had a reputation for producing unlicensed, homemade copies of firearms using whatever materials are available – more often than not, railway rails, scrap motor vehicles, and other [[Scrap|scrap metal]]. The quality of such firearms varies widely, ranging from as good as a factory-produced example to dangerously poor.

==Models==
[[Image:Webleypocket.jpg|thumb|240px|Copy of Webley Pocket Pistol in .38 S&amp;W, purchased at [[Bagram Airfield]], [[Afghanistan]]]]
The most commonly encountered Khyber Pass copies are of British military firearms, notably [[Martini–Henry]], [[Martini–Enfield]], and [[Lee–Enfield]] rifles, although [[AK-47]] rifles, [[Webley Revolver]]s, [[Tokarev TT-33]]s, [[Colt M1911]]s and [[Browning Hi-Power]]s have also been encountered. In the United States, a Kalashnikov-style rifle composed of a mix of parts from various style AK rifles is sometimes referred to as a Khyber Pass AK because, like Khyber guns, they are unlike any rifle produced by a factory or issued by a regular military force. The typical example of a "Khyber Pass AK" is a stamped [[Receiver (firearms)|receiver]] AKM chambered for the [[7.62×39mm]] cartridge, fitted with the triangular folding stock common to Russian [[AK-74|AKS-74]] rifles.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

The Khyber Pass gunsmiths first acquired examples of the various British service arms during nineteenth-century British military expeditions in the [[North-West Frontier (military history)|North-West Frontier]], which they used to make copies. During [[World War II]], some locally organised [[Irregular military|irregular forces]] were issued Khyber Pass-made rifles – partly for financial reasons and partly because there was concern the troops would steal their rifles and desert if issued higher-quality British or Indian manufactured rifles.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Skennerton, ''The Lee-Enfield Story'' (1993). Arms &amp; Militaria Press, Gold Coast QLD (Australia) {{ISBN|1-85367-138-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Identification==
{{externalvideo|video1=[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTvxFNRLbiw Khyber Pass Martini Pistol at RIA]}}
Khyber Pass rifles are usually copied exactly from a "master" rifle (which may itself be a Khyber Pass copy), markings and all. It's not uncommon to see Khyber Pass rifles with numerous errors and particular identifying factors, notably:
*Spelling errors in the markings (the most common of which is EИFIELD for ENFIELD)&lt;ref name="Atkin"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.martinihenry.com/khyberpage.html |title=The Khyber Pass Martini |author=Jason Atkin |publisher=[http://www.martinihenry.com/index.html Martini-Henry Rifles and Cartridges site] |accessdate=2009-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Manning2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Stephen Manning|title=The Martini-Henry Rifle|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sesENlxA8QAC&amp;pg=PT107|date=20 May 2013|publisher=Osprey Publishing|isbn=978-1-78096-508-6|pages=107–}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*V.R. (''Victoria Regina'') cyphers dated after 1901 – [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]] died in 1901, so any rifles made after this should be stamped "E.R" (''Edward Rex'', referring to [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|King Edward VII]])
*Generally inferior workmanship, including weak or soft metal, poorly finished wood, and badly struck markings.

Afghanistan was a [[The Great Game|point of conflict]] between the British Empire and Imperial Russia throughout the 19th century, from which it is reasonable to assume that tools and expertise relevant to both cultures were accumulated by native gunsmiths. Rather than a translation error, a reversed "N" or "L" in ENFIELD may be the [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]] "И" and "Г" characters, with the gunsmith using whatever [[Punch (metalworking)|letter punches]] similar to original letters, but ensuring it can be identified as duplicate to avoid legal issues of using original trademark names.

==Ammunition==
Not only are there counterfeit weapons, but there is counterfeit ammunition as well. Typically they are based on low-powered modern cartridges. .30 [[Gauge (firearms)|bore]] cartridges are compatible with [[7.63×25mm Mauser]] or [[7.62×25mm Tokarev]]. .32 bore cartridges are compatible with [[.32 ACP|.32 Auto Colt Pistol / 7.65mm Browning (7.65×17mmSR)]]. 12 bore cartridges are [[Gauge (bore diameter)#Sizes in use|12 gauge (18.5x70mmR)]] [[shotgun shell]]s.

44 bore cartridges are compatible with the [[7.92×33mm Kurz]] round for the World War Two era [[StG 44]]. Pakistan has a ban on rifles designed to fire military cartridges; the use of the 44 bore cartridge was a loophole in the law until specifically banned in 2012. It was used in AKM copies chambered or modified for it. It was a popular cartridge because it was easy to modify AKMs to fire it but still fed from standard AK magazines. Saquib brand makes 44 bore ammunition.

The ammunition used in the Khyber Pass region is often underloaded, being made from a variety of powders or even old film (which contains nitrocellulose, a key component of [[smokeless powder]]); Khyber Pass Copy rifles cannot be expected to withstand the pressures generated by modern commercial ammunition. A few collectors have made extremely mild handloaded cartridges for their Khyber Pass rifles and fired them, at substantial personal risk.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

The packaging and [[headstamp]]s are often forged versions of quality foreign brands like GECO (''Gustav Genschow &amp; Co.''), Golden Tiger (Vympel [[Integrated reporting|IIRC]]), China Sport ([[NORINCO]]), MEN (''Metallwerk Elisenhütte Nassau''), and PPU ([[Prvi Partizan|Prvi Partizan Užice]]). Local counterfeits have colorful brand-name packaging like Buffalo, Diamond, Double Dragon, Double Star, Federal SKF, Goodluck, Gorilla, and Tiger SBR.

The Khyber Arms Company, a local ammunition manufacturer, makes the Expert or X-Pert brand. It uses counterfeit Winchester ammunition packaging with cartridges stamped with fake [[NORINCO]] ''State Factory 311'' headstamps.

New casings and bullet jackets are usually copper-washed steel, like Chinese ammunition. The casings are sometimes recycled from scrounged US or NATO military brass casings. 5.56mm NATO cases are cut-down and reshaped to make .30 bore rounds. [[9×19mm Parabellum]] cases are cut down to make reloaded [[.380 ACP|.380 ACP / 9×17mm Short]] or [[9×18mm Makarov]] rounds.

The '''law of carriage of goods by sea''' is a body of law that governs the rights and duties of shippers, carriers and consignees of marine cargo.&lt;ref&gt;''The Law of Carriage of Goods by Sea'' (2011) - L.Singh&lt;/ref&gt;  

Primarily concerned with '''[[cargo claim]]s''', this body of law is an aspect of [[international commercial law]] and [[maritime law]].

==Cargo claims==
{{Main|freight claim}}
[[Consignee]]s (or indeed any lawful holder of the [[bill of lading]])&lt;ref&gt;Bill of lading, or sea way bill or ship's delivery order: Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1992 ss.1 &amp; 2&lt;/ref&gt; who wishes to make a cargo claim because their goods are substandard or have been lost or damaged at sea, typically have four options: 
* They may sue the '''seller''', the '''shipper''', or the '''carrier'''; or they may claim from their own '''insurance policy'''.
* A suit will lie against the seller if the seller has insufficient title,&lt;ref&gt; Sale of Goods Act1979 (as amended), section 12&lt;/ref&gt; or the goods are not of satisfactory quality,&lt;ref&gt; Sale of Goods Act1979 (as amended), section 14&lt;/ref&gt; or do not comply with sample&lt;ref&gt; Sale of Goods Act1979 (as amended), section 15&lt;/ref&gt; or description.&lt;ref&gt; Sale of Goods Act1979 (as amended), section 13&lt;/ref&gt;
* A suit will lie against the shipper if the goods are damaged through insufficient packing,&lt;ref&gt;Hague Visby Rules Art. IV Rule 2(n)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Goodwin v Lamport and Holt'' [1929] All ER 623&lt;/ref&gt; or if any loss is suffered through insufficient labelling.&lt;ref&gt;Hague Visby Rules Art. III&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Parsons v New Zealand Shipping'' [1901] KB 548&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Bunge v Brasil'' [2009] 2 Lloyds Rep 175  &lt;/ref&gt;
* A suit will lie against the carrier if the damage occurred aboard ship.&lt;ref&gt;Hague-Visby Rules Arts. II &amp; III&lt;/ref&gt; The carrier's [[Protection and indemnity insurance|P&amp;I Club]] cover will normally bear the cost.
* If the cargo is damaged where the shipper without fault (e.g. if the goods have been properly packed and stowed) or if the carrier is either blameless or exempted from liability&lt;ref&gt;Hague-Visby Rules Art IV&lt;/ref&gt;  (e.g. because of '[[Act of God]]' or '[[Deviation (law) |Justifiable Deviation]]'), &lt;ref&gt;''The Teutonia'' (1872) LR 4 PC 171&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Al Taha'' [1990] 2 LL R 117&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;	''Stag Line v Foscolo, Mango &amp; Co'' [1932] AC 328&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;''Scaramanga v Stamp'' (1880) 5 CPD 295&lt;/ref&gt; a cargo-owner will have to claim on his own cargo policy.
A claim having been paid, the assured's rights of claim will be [[Subrogation|subrogated]] to the insurer, who may consider proceeding against a party who has caused the damage.

A [[Ship-owner|shipowner]] may sue a [[Chartering (shipping)#Charter types|time-charterer]] or [[Chartering (shipping)|voyage-charterer]] in the event of breach of contract. For instance, if the charterer exceeds [[laytime]], [[demurrage]] will have to be paid; and if the charterer cannot comply with a [[Laytime|Notice of Readiness]] (NOR), the shipowner may [[Anticipatory repudiation|repudiate]] (cancel) the contract of carriage and claim [[damages]] for any loss.&lt;ref&gt;[[Maredelanto Compania Naviera SA v Bergbau-Handel GmbH]]|''The Mihalis Angelos''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Carriage conventions==
In most contracts of carriage the carrier has greater bargaining power than the shipper, and in the 19th century English judges developed rules to protect the weaker parties.&lt;ref&gt;''M'Andrew  v Adams'' (1834) 1 Bing NC 29&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning with the [[Hague Rules]], the various conventions set out to codify and develop such [[common law]] principles by providing an international set of basic standards to be met by the carrier, with a view to establishing a universal framework of legal rights and duties. In practice, however, the level of protection was actually reduced because of new provisions allowing the carrier to (i) limit his liability, and (ii) rely on a wide array of exemptions from liability &lt;ref&gt;...such as "[[Act of God]]", "[[Perils of the Sea]]" and "[[negligence]] in navigation or management of the ship").&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Hague-Visby Rules Art. IV (1) &amp; (2)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Principles of the Carriage of Goods by Sea'' -Paul Todd&lt;/ref&gt; Also, whereas up until about 1885,&lt;ref&gt;''The Glenfruin'' (1885) 10 PD 103&lt;/ref&gt; the carrier's duties were deemed to be [[Strict liability|strict]], by 1905 the duty became one of "[[reasonable care]]" or "[[due diligence]]" only.&lt;ref&gt;''McFadden v Blue Star Line'' [1905] 1 KB 697&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hague Rules of 1924 effectively [[Codification (law)|codified]], albeit in a diluted form, the English common law rules to protect the cargo owner against exploitation by the carrier. Nearly 50 years later, the [[Hague-Visby Rules|Hague-Visby]] "update" made few changes, so that the newer Rules still applied only to "tackle to tackle" carriage (i.e. carriage by sea) and the [[Intermodal container|container]] revolution of the 1950s was virtually ignored. The Hague-Visby Rules both excluded cabotage carriage, and declared that deck cargo and live animals were not to be considered as "goods" (although the  [[Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1971]] provided that cabotage, deck cargo and live animals are to be covered in English contracts). 

The enormous list of exemptions to liability in Article IV made the Rules seem biased in favour of the carrier. As a result, The United Nations produced its own Hamburg Rules which were both more modern and fairer to cargo-owners; but while these have been enthusiastically adopted by developing nations, the wealthier ship-owning nations have stuck to Hague-Visby. In 2008 the final text of the Rotterdam Rules was agreed at [[UNCITRAL]].&lt;ref&gt; UNCITRAL: United Nations Commission of International Trade Law.&lt;/ref&gt;  These Rules are very extensive, with over 90 Articles against 11 in Hague-Visby.  Although the Rotterdam Rules are up-to-date and address multimodal carriage, they have, nine years later, yet to be in force.  It now seems doubtful that the Rotterdam Rules will ever be adopted, but there is a slim possibility that a cut-down version of the Rules ("Rotterdam Lite") might find favour.

China has effectively adopted the Hague Rules. The USA, which tends to shun conventions and instead rely on homespun legislation, has its own [[statutes]]. These comprise the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act (a mildly updated version of the Hague Rules for goods in foreign commerce), and the [[Harter Act]] (for mostly domestic carriage).&lt;ref&gt;Lexolology report [https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=04c1704f-05cd-4dc5-89c8-bb1a921dd13b]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Kenya]] EPZ Authority the aim of the program is "to transform the economy from import substitution to a path of export led growth". "EPZs are designed to further integrate Kenya into the global supply chain and attract export-oriented investments in the zones, thus achieving its economic objectives of job creation, diversification and expansion of exports, increase in productive investments, technology transfer and creation of backward linkages between the zones and the domestic economy"."The program has contributed significantly to achieving these objectives with over 40 zones in place, close to 40,000 workers employed and contribution of 10.7 % of national exports. Over 70% of EPZ output is exported to the USA under AGOA".&lt;ref name="KenyaEPZA"&gt;

* Kandla Special Economic Zone, India. India was one of the first in Asia to recognize the effectiveness of the Export Processing Zone (EPZ) model in promoting exports, with Asia's first EPZ set up in Kandla in 1965. With a view to overcome the shortcomings experienced on account of the multiplicity of controls and clearances; absence of world-class infrastructure, and an unstable fiscal regime and with a view to attract larger foreign investments in India, the Special Economic Zones (SEZs) Policy was announced in April 2000.
SuRSEZ is the First Operating Zone in the private sector in India. The track record of SuRSEZ in the last 5 years speaks for itself. From a level of about Rs.62 crores in 2000-01, exports from SuRSEZ rose to Rs. 2400 crores in the year 2005-06.

==Career==

=== CNN ===
Dobbs joined CNN when it launched in 1980, serving as its chief [[economics]] [[correspondent]] and as [[Host (radio)#Television presenter|host]] of the business news program ''[[Lou Dobbs Tonight|Moneyline]]'' on CNN. Dobbs also served as a [[corporate executive]] for CNN, as its executive vice president and as a member of CNN's executive committee. He founded [[CNN fn]] (CNN financial news), serving as its president and anchoring the program ''Business Unusual'', which examined business creativity and leadership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsbios.com/newslum/dobbs.htm |title=Business News Luminaries |publisher=Newsbios.com |date= |accessdate=2010-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Departure and founding of Space.com===
Dobbs repeatedly clashed with [[Rick Kaplan]], who became president of CNN in 1997. Dobbs said Kaplan, noted friend of then president [[Bill Clinton]], was "clearly partisan" and "was pushing Clinton stories", while Kaplan said Dobbs was "a very difficult person to work with".&lt;ref name="Madashell"/&gt;

On April 20, 1999, CNN was covering Clinton's speech in [[Littleton, Colorado]], following the [[Columbine High School massacre]]. Dobbs ordered the producer to cut away from the speech and return to broadcast ''Moneyline''.&lt;ref name="Madashell"/&gt; Dobbs was countermanded by Kaplan, who ordered CNN to return to the speech. Kaplan later said, "Tell me what journalistic reason there was not to cover the president at Columbine soon after the shootings? Everyone else was doing it". Dobbs announced on the air that "CNN President Rick Kaplan wants us to return to Littleton". A few days later, Dobbs announced that he was leaving the network to start [[Space.com]], a website devoted to [[Astronautics|astronautical]] news.&lt;ref name="Madashell"/&gt; Dobbs was subsequently replaced as host of ''Moneyline'' by [[Willow Bay]] and [[Stuart Varney]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timewarner.com/corp/newsroom/pr/0,20812,667811,00.html |title=MONEYLINE Launches Bicoastal News Format |publisher=Time Warner |date=2000-08-22 |accessdate=2010-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Return to CNN===
Kaplan left CNN in August 2000, and Dobbs returned the following year, at the behest of his friend and CNN founder [[Ted Turner]], becoming host and [[managing editor]] of the new and initially more general news program ''Lou Dobbs Reporting'', which later became ''CNN News Sunday Morning''.

===Exit from CNN===
On the November 11, 2009 edition of his nightly broadcast ''Lou Dobbs Tonight'', Dobbs announced his immediate departure from CNN, ending a nearly thirty-year career at the network, citing plans to "pursue new opportunities".&lt;ref name="Update: Lou Dobbs to Quit CNN"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/11/11/lou-dobbs-to-depart-cnn/|title=Update: Lou Dobbs to Quit CNN|last1=Stelter|first1=Brian|date=2009-11-11|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=2009-11-11|last2=Carter|first2=Bill}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "CNN1"&gt;{{Cite book

In July 2009, controversy around Dobbs began when he was the only mainstream news anchor to give airtime to the [[birther]] conspiracy theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/08/02/lou-dobbs-a-publicity-nig_n_249466.html |title=Lou Dobbs A "Publicity Nightmare" For CNN: AP |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |date= 2009-08-02|accessdate=2010-04-12 |first=Rachel |last=Weiner}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several liberal advocacy groups, including [[Media Matters for America|Media Matters]], and the [[Southern Poverty Law Center]] criticized Dobbs for his reporting.  The controversy eventually caused CNN President [[Jonathan Klein (CNN)|Jon Klein]] to rein Dobbs in via an internal memorandum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Ariens |first=Chris |url=http://www.mediabistro.com/tvnewser/cnn/jon_klein_on_birthers_it_seems_this_story_is_dead_122546.asp |title=Jon Klein on Birthers: "It Seems This Story is Dead" – mediabistro.com: TVNewser |publisher=mediabistro.com |date=2009-07-24 |accessdate=2010-04-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100425075638/http://www.mediabistro.com/tvnewser/cnn/jon_klein_on_birthers_it_seems_this_story_is_dead_122546.asp |archivedate=2010-04-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In September, advocates challenged Dobbs for appearing at a conference organized by the anti-immigration group Federation for American Immigration Reform.  Multiple campaigns were launched, including "Drop Dobbs" ([[New Democrat Network|NDN]], [[Media Matters for America|Media Matters]]), and "Basta Dobbs" ([[Presente.org]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bastadobbs.com/blog/2009/sep/16/latino-leaders-across-us-demand-cnn-drop-controver/ |title=Basta Dobbs : Latino Leaders Across U.S. Demand CNN Drop Controversial Host Lou Dobbs for Extremist Ties |publisher=BastaDobbs.com |date= |accessdate=2010-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The campaigns also attacked CNN for alleged hypocrisy towards Latinos, citing CNN's ''Latino in America'' special as incompatible with their continued support of Dobbs. The campaigns generated considerable anti-Dobbs press,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.impre.com/eldiariony/noticias/locales/2009/10/22/hispanos-a-cnn--eres-latino-o--155229-1.html |title=El Diario La Prensa NY – noticias de Nueva York – impre.com – Hispanos a CNN: ¿eres latino o anti-latino? |publisher=impre.com |date=2009-10-22 |accessdate=2010-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are credited by some{{Who|date=September 2010}} as pushing Dobbs out.

Dobbs was reportedly paid $8 million in severance pay when he left CNN prior to his contract being due for renewal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Shain |first=Michael |url=http://www.nypost.com/p/news/national/source_cnn_wanted_lou_out_LOBEhi0KhBVvzqxDoxbPWI |title=Source: CNN wanted Lou out |publisher=Nypost.com |date=2009-11-16 |accessdate=2010-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Dobbs left CNN in 2009, he gave an interview where he did not rule out the possibility of running for [[President of the United States]] in [[United States presidential election, 2012|2012]], saying the final decision would rest with his wife.&lt;ref&gt;Memmot, Mark (2009-11-24) [https://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2009/11/lou_dobbs_white_house_independ.html "Lou Dobbs Hints At White House Run In 2012 As An Independent"], NPR.org.

===Radio===
From 2009 to 2012, Dobbs hosted ''Lou Dobbs Radio'' on [[United Stations Radio Networks]]. The three-hour daily show had affiliates in several major markets, including its [[flagship (radio)|flagship station]] ([[WOR (AM)|WOR]]) in New York City, [[Washington D.C.]] ([[WJFK (AM)|WHFS]]), [[Miami]] ([[WZAB]]-AM) and the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] ([[KDOW]]), as well as stations such as [[WGNY (AM)|WGNY-AM]] in [[Newburgh (city), New York|Newburgh, New York]]. The show was guest-centered and featured political discussion and listener calls. It aired from 2 to 5 p.m. Eastern, directly competing with ''[[The Sean Hannity Show]]'', ''The Tom Sullivan Show'' and ''[[The Dave Ramsey Show (radio program)|The Dave Ramsey Show]]''. Dobbs also hosts the financially themed ''Lou Dobbs Minute'' on the same network.

In June 2008, Dobbs reached an agreement with [[Business Talk Radio Network]] to carry a rebroadcast of the show from 7 p.m. to 10 p.m. Eastern, displacing [[Bruce Williams (talk radio host)|Bruce Williams]]. Dobbs' show was also carried live on [[CRN Digital Talk Radio Networks]].

Dobbs was among the hosts who tried out for the position vacated by the cancellation of ''[[Imus in the Morning]]'' on [[WFAN (AM)|WFAN]], a position that was eventually filled by ''[[Boomer and Carton in the Morning]]''. Dobbs mentioned on his radio show that he is currently seeking a position in the [[US Department of Treasury]] during the economic crisis. He stated that he believed he could "do more good than the clowns currently in position."

Dobbs also is a regular columnist in ''[[Money (magazine)|Money]]'' magazine, ''[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]]'', and the ''[[New York Daily News]]''.&lt;ref name="Madashell"/&gt;

===Current show on Fox Business Network===

On November 10, 2010, Fox Business Network announced that Dobbs would host a show on the channel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/entertainmentnewsbuzz/2010/11/lou-dobbs-joining-fox-business-network.html Lou Dobbs joining Fox Business Network] ''Los Angeles Times''  November 10, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The network announced on March 3, 2011 the start date, show title, and time slot of Dobbs' new show. Titled ''[[Lou Dobbs Tonight]]'' the program debuted on March 14, 2011, airing at 7 PM Eastern. That is the same title and time slot that Dobbs' old CNN show had.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/03/03/lou-dobbs-fox-business-sh_n_831033.html Lou Dobbs' new Fox Business show gets a start date and a name] ''The Huffington Post''  March 3, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other appearances===

Since 2009, Dobbs has made regular appearances to discuss issues on other news network programs including CNBC's ''[[The Kudlow Report]]'' and Fox News Channel's ''[[The O'Reilly Factor]]''. On October 5, 2010, Dobbs made a guest appearance on an episode of ''[[The Good Wife (TV series)|The Good Wife]]'', entitled "Double Jeopardy",&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|1632297|The Good Wife, Double Jeopardy}} October 5, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; in which he plays himself as a client in search of a new law firm to represent his legal interests.

==Political views and controversies==

Dobbs was a lifelong Republican.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, he later registered as an Independent following a break with the Bush Administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mediaite.com/tv/lou-dobbs-says-it-may-be-time-to-declare-war-outright-against-the-deep-state/|title=Lou Dobbs Says 'It May Be Time to Declare War Outright Against the Deep State'|author=|date=|website=www.mediaite.com|accessdate=27 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dobbs is known for his anti-immigration views,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/apr/28/usa.television|title=Hispanic congressmen demand corporate action against CNN host|last=Schor|first=Elana|date=2008-04-28|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-10-14|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt; warnings about Islamist terror, and his opposition to free trade.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/money/economy/employment/2005-02-22-dobbs-usat_x.htm | work=USA Today | first1=Michael | last1=McCarthy | title=Dobbs blasts outsourcing | date=2005-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is known for his pro-Trump coverage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://money.cnn.com/2017/09/14/media/pro-trump-media-daca-dreamers/index.html|title=Pro-Trump media incensed over reports he struck deal with Dems on Dreamers|last=Darcy|first=Oliver|work=CNNMoney|access-date=2017-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://uk.businessinsider.com/trump-media-democrats-debt-deal-2017-9?r=US&amp;IR=T|title=Right-wing media praises Trump's deal with the Democrats and rips Republican leaders|work=Business Insider|access-date=2017-10-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://amp.thedailybeast.com/donald-trump-cherishes-lou-dobbs-so-much-he-puts-him-on-speakerphone-for-oval-office-meetings|title=Donald Trump 'Cherishes' Lou Dobbs So Much He Puts Him on Speakerphone for Oval Office Meetings|website=amp.thedailybeast.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''The Daily Beast'', by 2018, Dobbs had turned into a "full-on conservative nationalist-populist and culture warrior."&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

===Birtherism===
Dobbs promoted the [[Barack Obama citizenship conspiracy theories|false conspiracy theory]] that [[Barack Obama]] was not born in the United States.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Guardian Unlimited]]'', 29 July 2009, [https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2009/jul/29/birthers-obama-citizenship-republicans Birthers are citizens of Idiot America]&lt;/ref&gt; His willingness to raise the "[[birther]]" issue repeatedly&lt;ref&gt;"a lot of questions remaining, and seemingly the questions won't go away because they haven't been dealt with".

In a 2006 article, Dobbs expressed frustration at failed legislation to build a southern "border fence to stop the flow of illegal aliens and drugs across our borders." He argued that the "true victims of corporate America's lust for cheap labor" were "American working men and women, taxpayers all."&lt;ref name="Dobbs_CNN_2006_wall"&gt;{{cite news |title=Five-weeks off for 'do-nothing Congress' |author=Lou Dobbs |work=CNN |date=August 2, 2006 |location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dobbs' show has made factually incorrect claims, such as the one that illegal immigrants were responsible for bringing 7,000 new cases of [[leprosy]] to the United States in a three-year period, where the actual timeframe was over the last thirty years.&lt;ref&gt;James L.

Dobbs has criticized local officials for their approach to border security.

In a November 2009 interview with [[Telemundo]], Dobbs said that the U.S. needed a "rational, effective humane policy" for immigration that included enhanced border security and also "the ability to legalize illegal immigrants on certain conditions."&lt;ref&gt;Angie Drobnic Holan, [http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/nov/30/lou-dobbs/did-lou-dobbs-oppose-amnesty-he-doesnt-oppose-it-n/ Did Lou Dobbs oppose amnesty?

In March 2009, Dobbs said he thought that there should not be a [[St. Patricks Day]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://thinkprogress.org/lou-dobbs-attacks-st-patricks-day-how-about-an-american-day-e61c94b1d3aa|title=Lou Dobbs attacks St. Patrick's Day: 'How about an American day?'|date=18 March 2009|work=[[ThinkProgress]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2010, ''[[The Nation]]'' published the results of a yearlong investigation detailing undocumented workers who had worked on Dobbs' personal properties. The labor involved upkeep of Dobbs' multimillion-dollar estates in [[New Jersey]] and [[Florida]], including the horses belonging to his daughter, Hillary, a champion show jumper. The article featured interviews with five immigrants who had worked without papers on Dobbs' properties. Dobbs and his daughter had declined to comment to ''The Nation'' as part of the story.&lt;ref name="amhypocrite"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenation.com/article/155209/lou-dobbs-american-hypocrite?page=full|title=Lou Dobbs, American Hypocrite|last=MacDonald|first=Isabel|date=2010-10-06|work=[[The Nation]]|accessdate=2010-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speaking to the [[Associated Press]], Dobbs referred to the article as "a political assault," claiming it was a lie that he hired illegal immigrants. He said: "I have never, do not now, and never will."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/10/07/AR2010100704043.html Report: Illegal Labor Worked at Dobbs' homes] AP via Washington Post; October 7, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

On his show ''Lou Dobbs Tonight'', Dobbs stopped short of a full endorsement of Presidential candidate [[Donald Trump]], saying, "Whatever you think of Trump, whatever your politics, Trump has taken on enormous risk and threats in seeking the presidency ... promised to restore the voice of the people ... and a government that will respect all that our Constitution assures." Dobbs has since endorsed Donald Trump.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.facebook.com/LouDobbsTonight/videos/10153688766037951/|title=Political and business establishment intensifying its assault on Donald J.

On October 13, 2016, Dobbs publicized by [[Twitter]] a link which contained the address and phone number of a woman who was among several who had come forward with allegations of being sexually assaulted by Republican Presidential candidate Donald Trump.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/blogs/on-media/2016/10/fox-anchor-tweets-trump-accusers-address-and-phone-number-229738|title=Lou Dobbs tweets Trump accuser's address and phone number|publisher=[[Politico]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trump repeatedly calls Dobbs to get his views on various policy issues.  In 2017 Trump patched Dobbs into senior-level [[Oval Office]] meetings multiple times, sometimes interrupting officials to ask for Dobbs' opinions.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Dobbs is a proponent of the [[Deep state in the United States|Deep State conspiracy theory]]. In January 2018, Dobbs called for a "war" on the "Deep State", which he described as the FBI and the Department of Justice.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://thehill.com/homenews/media/370469-lou-dobbs-its-time-to-declare-war-on-deep-state#.WmlNOdL_MzY.twitter|title=Lou Dobbs: 'May be time to declare war' on 'deep state'|last=Anapol|first=Avery|date=2018-01-24|work=TheHill|access-date=2018-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dobbs said that the FBI and DOJ had destroyed evidence and that they were clandestinely working to bring down the Trump presidency.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In June 2018, Dobbs promoted a conspiracy which originated on Reddit and the far-right conspiracy website Gateway Pundit that "the FBI May have initiated a number of spies into the Trump campaign as early as December of 2015."&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2018/06/06/politics/trump-fbi-texts-conspiracy-theory/index.html|title=From Reddit to Trump: How the President latched onto a conspiracy theory|last=CNN|first=Jeremy Herb and Manu Raju,|work=CNN|access-date=2018-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after Dobbs promoted the unfounded conspiracy theory, Trump retweeted Dobbs' assertion and praised Dobbs for a "great interview".&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; In July 2018, Dobbs said that Special Counsel Robert Mueller was on a "jihad" against Trump, and accused him of seeking to "subvert" and "overthrow" Trump's presidency.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://uk.businessinsider.com/fox-host-lou-dobbs-mueller-trump-2018-7?r=US&amp;IR=T|title='The hell with Mueller': Fox host Lou Dobbs says the special counsel is on 'jihad' against Trump|work=Business Insider|access-date=2018-08-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Trump criticized Attorney General Jeff Sessions for not investigating alleged abuses of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act in the investigation on Russian interference in the 2016 election, Dobbs attacked Sessions, saying that he had become physically or mentally unwell.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/fox-news-host-lou-dobbs-jeff-sessions-has-fallen-ill-needs-to-resign|title=Fox News Host Lou Dobbs: Jeff Sessions Has 'Fallen Ill,' Needs to Resign|last=Tani|first=Maxwell|date=2018-03-04|work=The Daily Beast|access-date=2018-03-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dobbs said, "Sessions has fallen ill, he's incapacitated in some fashion, or he's been coopted or captured: to preserve any dignity, for the good of the country he needs to resign."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

In July 2018, Dobbs defended the Trump administration's decision to ban a CNN reporter from a press event.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://thehill.com/media/398919-lou-dobbs-to-cnn-after-white-house-bans-cnn-reporter-who-the-hell-are-you|title=Lou Dobbs to CNN after White House bans reporter: 'Who the hell are you?'|last=Birnbaum|first=Emily|date=2018-07-25|work=TheHill|access-date=2018-07-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Multiple Fox colleagues, including Fox News President Jay Wallace, had shown solidarity with CNN and called on the White House to rescind the ban.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; In 2012, when a ''Daily Caller'' reporter was criticized by the White House for shouting out a question during an address by Obama, Dobbs defended the reporter, saying "What is rude is a president not speaking to the American people and taking the questions of the White House press."&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/jake-tapper-calls-out-foxs-lou-dobbs-for-attacking-cnns-kaitlan-collins|title=Jake Tapper Calls Out Fox’s Lou Dobbs on ‘Colbert’ for Attacking CNN’s Kaitlan Collins|last=Wilstein|first=Matt|date=2018-07-27|work=The Daily Beast|access-date=2018-07-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''CNN''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s [[Jake Tapper]] suggested that Dobbs was hypocritical, saying "Lou Dobbs, it might surprise you to find out, had a very different take on the situation....

In August 2018, Dobbs called CNN journalist [[Jim Acosta]] "delicate" and "triggered" after Acosta recorded a hostile crowd Trump supporters at a rally harassing him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://uk.businessinsider.com/jim-acosta-calls-sean-hannity-a-propagandist-for-profit-2018-8?utm_source=reddit.com&amp;r=US&amp;IR=T|title='A propagandist for profit, peddling lies every night': CNN correspondent Jim Acosta goes in on Fox News host Sean Hannity|work=Business Insider|access-date=2018-08-03|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.mediamatters.org/video/2018/08/01/lou-dobbs-criticizes-jim-acosta-triggered-and-delicate-after-trump-supporters-harassed-him-rally/220883|title=Lou Dobbs criticizes Jim Acosta as "triggered" and "delicate" after Trump supporters harassed him at rally|date=2018-08-01|work=Media Matters for America|access-date=2018-08-03|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

That same month, Dobbs ran a segment pushing unsubstantiated claims that Google was biased against Trump and that Google was promoting anti-Trump stories.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.axios.com/trump-tweet-google-censorship-e5fb9792-069b-419e-8506-03855d3bf9c7.html|title=Go deeper: Tracing Trump's Google censorship tweet|website=Axios|language=en|access-date=2018-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2018/08/28/a-short-investigation-into-trumps-tweets-on-rigged-google-results-about-himself/|title=Analysis {{!}} A short investigation into Trump’s claims of ‘RIGGED’ Google results against him|last=|first=|date=|website=Washington Post|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following Dobbs' segment, Trump tweeted that Google was suppressing conservatives and he tasked economic adviser Larry Kudlow to look into regulating Google.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

In September 2018, after Trump falsely claimed that the official death count from [[Hurricane Maria death toll controversy|Hurricane Maria]] in Puerto Rico were fabricated by Democrats, Dobbs defended Trump's assertion.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/406644-trump-shares-lou-dobbs-segment-doubling-down-on-his-puerto-rico|title=Trump shares Lou Dobbs segment praising his Puerto Rico claims|last=Keller|first=Megan|date=2018-09-13|work=TheHill|access-date=2018-09-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dobbs claimed that "the numbers were inflated" and that the organizations behind the numbers "threw out science, statistics, and evidence to discredit the Trump administration."&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

In October 2018, when CNN and a number of prominent Democrats were targeted with bomb attempts, Dobbs described the bomb attempts as "fake news" and promoted conspiracy theories that the bomb attempts were by Democrats who sought to increase their support in the upcoming mid-term elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://uk.businessinsider.com/lou-dobbs-tweet-conspiracy-theory-democrats-mail-bombs-2018-10?r=UK&amp;IR=T|title=Lou Dobbs promotes conspiracy theory that Democrats sent explosive devices to Clinton, Obama, and Soros to improve midterm chances|work=Business Insider|access-date=2018-10-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://thehill.com/homenews/media/413103-fox-business-networks-dobbs-calls-bomb-attacks-fake-bombs-in-since-deleted|title=Fox Business Network's Dobbs calls bomb attacks 'fake bombs' in since-deleted tweet|last=Nam|first=Rafael|date=2018-10-25|work=TheHill|access-date=2018-10-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several Fox News employees expressed dismay over Dobbs' rhetoric, with one employee telling CNN, "It's people like Dobbs who really ruin it for all the hard working journalists at Fox."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2018/10/25/media/lou-dobbs-fake-bombs/index.html|title=Fox Business Network host Lou Dobbs peddles conspiracy theory about suspicious packages|last=Business|first=Oliver Darcy, CNN|work=CNN|access-date=2018-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the Trump administration rescinded CNN White House correspondent Jim Acosta's press pass, Dobbs supported the administration. At the same time, numerous media organizations, including Fox News, spoke out against the Trump administration's decision. When U.S. District Court Judge Timothy Kelly, a Trump appointee, temporarily restored Acosta's press pass, Dobbs described the ruling as "absurd."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/lou-dobbs-loses-his-mind-after-cnn-defeats-white-house-over-acostas-press-access|title=Lou Dobbs Loses His Mind After CNN Defeats White House Over Acosta’s Press Access|last=Melendez|first=Pilar|date=2018-11-16|work=The Daily Beast|access-date=2018-11-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the Trump administration complied with the ruling, Dobbs called on the administration to ignore the ruling and tell the "district court judge to go to hell."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/lou-dobbs-freaks-after-trump-surrenders-to-cnns-jim-acosta-says-president-should-tell-judge-to-go-to-hell|title=Lou Dobbs: Trump Should Tell Judge in CNN Case to ‘Go to Hell’|last=Wilstein|first=Matt|date=2018-11-20|work=The Daily Beast|access-date=2018-11-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thewrap.com/lou-dobbs-suggests-trump-should-have-ignored-court-order-on-jim-acosta/|title=Lou Dobbs Suggests Trump Should Have Ignored Court Order on Acosta|date=2018-11-20|work=TheWrap|access-date=2018-11-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===George Soros===
Dobbs has peddled numerous conspiracy theories about the Jewish-American philanthropist and businessman George Soros.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2018/10/28/media/lou-dobbs-fox-news-guest/index.html|title=Fox condemns rhetoric used by Lou Dobbs guest as channel's star host faces growing criticism|last=Business|first=Oliver Darcy, CNN|work=CNN|access-date=2018-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dobbs has referred to him as an "evil SOB" and insidious.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; 

Dobbs's Fox Business Channel shows stirred controversy in October 2018 when a guest on Dobbs' show used what many described as an anti-Semitic trope to suggest that the State Department was "Soros-occupied" territory (which echoed the anti-Semitic trope of a "Zionist-occupied government").&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://newrepublic.com/minutes/151926/lou-dobbs-extreme-even-fox-business-news|title=Lou Dobbs is too extreme even for Fox Business News.|work=The New Republic|access-date=2018-11-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The remarks came days after bombing attempts on Soros, and the remarks were replayed on Fox Business hours after an anti-Semitic attack on a Pittsburgh synagogue which killed 11 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://thehill.com/homenews/media/413542-fox-business-exec-condemns-rhetoric-of-guest-who-blamed-migrant-caravan-on|title=Fox Business drops guest who blamed migrant caravan on 'Soros-occupied State Department'|last=Anapol|first=Avery|date=2018-10-28|work=TheHill|access-date=2018-11-05|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; After widespread condemnation, Fox stated that the guest, Chris Farrell of Judicial Watch, would no longer be booked.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://eu.usatoday.com/story/money/nation-now/2018/10/29/lou-dobbs-controversy-fox-bans-george-soros-conspiracy-theory-guest/1804634002/|title=Fox bans Lou Dobbs' guest over George Soros conspiracy theory|work=USA TODAY|access-date=2018-11-05|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

===Other views===
Dobbs was a registered [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]. Though he made a donation of $1,000 to the [[George W. Bush presidential campaign, 2000|Bush-Cheney]] campaign in January 2001,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url = http://www.newsmeat.com/media_political_donations/Lou_Dobbs.php | title = Lou Dobbs's Federal Campaign Contribution Report | date = 2007-02-04 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061104180416/http://www.newsmeat.com/media_political_donations/Lou_Dobbs.php | archivedate = 2006-11-04 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; he often has described the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]] and the then Republican-controlled [[United States Congress|Congress]] as "disgraceful." He has also argued that both parties are controlled by corporate interests.&lt;ref&gt;Dobbs, Lou, (2006). War on the Middle Class. The Dobbs Group, pp. 127-128&lt;/ref&gt;

Dobbs is [[pro-choice]], opposes [[gun control]] and, though he is a fiscal conservative, supports some government regulations, as revealed in a ''[[60 Minutes]]'' interview.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/05/03/60minutes/main2758082_page3.shtml |title=Lou Dobbs, "Advocacy" Journalist? |publisher=Cbsnews.com |date=2007-05-06 |accessdate=2010-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has been critical of trade policies that he says encourage "sending jobs overseas".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url = http://msnbc.msn.com/id/4670239/ | title = CNN's Lou Dobbs is a man on a mission | work = [[MSNBC]] | accessdate = 2007-06-03 | agency = Associated Press | date = 2004-04-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dobbs' stance on trade has earned plaudits from some [[Labor unions in the United States|trade union]] activists on the traditional [[Modern liberalism in the United States|political left]], while his stance on immigration tends to appeal to the [[American conservatism|right]].&lt;ref name="Madashell"/&gt; In an interview with [[Larry King]], Dobbs revealed that he is now "an unaffiliated independent" owing to dissatisfaction with both the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] and [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic parties]].

In June 2006, as the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]] debated the [[Federal Marriage Amendment]], Dobbs was critical of the action. He asserted that marriage was threatened more by financial crises perpetuated by Bush administration economic policy than by [[same-sex marriage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url = http://www.cnn.com/2006/US/06/06/dobbs.june7/index.html | title = Dobbs: Gay marriage amendment sheer nonsense | date = 2006-06-08 | accessdate = 2006-01-17 | work=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dobbs is the author of ''War on the Middle Class'', in which he claims that both Democrats and Republicans are harming the middle class. In it, he comes out strongly against the [[Bush tax cuts]], which he argues favor the wealthy, and argued for raising the U.S. [[minimum wage]] from what was then $5.15 an hour.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url = http://www.cnn.com/2006/US/10/10/Dobbs.Oct11/index.html | title = Dobbs: Middle class needs to fight back now | date = 2006-10-18 | accessdate = 2006-01-17 | work=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==
Dobbs has also been criticized for his lack of [[journalistic ethics]] by liberal news journalist [[Amy Goodman]]. She accused him of flagrant errors in his reporting and his staff's association with disreputable sources, stating that "he has a special responsibility to rely on facts and to correct misstatements of fact."&lt;ref name="amy06seattlePI"&gt;{{Cite news|title=CNN's Lou Dobbs needs to follow his own advice |date=December 5, 2007 |first=AMY |last=GOODMAN|

==Awards==
Dobbs has won numerous major awards for his television journalism, most notably a [[Emmy Award|Lifetime Achievement Emmy Award]] and a [[Cable ACE Awards|Cable Ace Award]]. He received the [[Peabody Award|George Foster Peabody Award]] for his coverage of the [[Black Monday (1987)|1987 stock market crash]]. He also has received the Luminary Award of the Business Journalism Review in 1990, the [[Horatio Alger, Jr.|Horatio Alger]] Association Award for Distinguished Americans in 1999 and the National Space Club Media Award in 2000. ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' has named Dobbs "TV's Premier Business News Anchorman".

==Early life==
Nchindo was born 30 November 1941 in [[Tlokweng]], Botswana, and was educated in [[Molepolole]] and [[St. Joseph's College, Kgale]], Botswana.&lt;ref name=nkala2010 /&gt; He went on to study medicine at [[University College London Medical School]], but in 1964 quit the program to enroll at [[Balliol College, Oxford]], receiving BA degree in Politics, Philosophy and Economics.&lt;ref name=dailynews2004&gt;[http://www.gov.bw/cgi-bin/news.cgi?d=20041004&amp;i=Former_Debswana_chief_receives_top_honour Former Debswana chief receives top honour].

After working for Procter and Gamble in Caracas, [[Venezuela]], and southern Africa, Nchindo rose to become the managing director of Debswana, the chairman of the [[Botswana Stock Exchange]], Botswana head for [[Barclays Bank]] and resident director of [[Anglo American PLC|Anglo American]] in Botswana. Nchindo became director of the Anglo-American owned [[De Beers|De Beers Botswana Mining Company]], which had government contracts to market all Botswana diamonds.

Nchindo presided over a successful period at Debswana, but eventually fell out with the president, who in 2004 refused to renew his employment. Following his September 2004 retirement, Nchindo was awarded Botswana's highest honor, the Presidential Order of Honour Award, by Former President of the Botswana Festus Mogae during the country's Independence Day celebrations, although he did not attend to ceremony.&lt;ref name=dailynews2004 /&gt; Prior to this, Nchindo had also gained press attention when he fired 461 Debswana workers for engaging in industrial action.&lt;ref name=nkala2010 /&gt;

In 2008 [[Gaborone]] Chief Magistrate [[Lot Moroka]] brought corruption charges against Nchindo, which were ongoing at the time of his death.&lt;ref&gt;[http://allafrica.com/stories/200801220800.html Botswana: Mogae Versus Nchindo].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2428">'''Metropolitan Educational Enterprises, Inc.''' is a company, founded in 1968 and based in [[Chicago, Illinois]], that reportedly sells educational materials through [[independent contractor]]s.  The company often targets [[Military of the United States|US military]] members as potential customers, sometimes even conducting door-to-door soliciting on [[military base]]s.

Military families have complained to the media that the company's representatives use deceptive selling techniques and hidden fees and charges. If military families fall behind on payments for expensive encyclopedias or educational materials, which customers report are often never or tardily delivered, the company used aggressive collection tactics, including calling the commanders of customer's [[military unit]]s.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}

{{Other people|Richard Baker}}
 
'''Richard "Dick" Baker''' (September 3, 1946 &amp;ndash; April 14, 2009) was an  [[United States|American]] businessman and [[surfing|surf]] apparel executive for [[Ocean Pacific]]. Baker helped to shape the surf apparel industry as president and chief executive of Ocean Pacific, also known as OP.&lt;ref name=lat&gt;{{cite news |first=Adam|last=Tschorn|title=Richard Baker dies at 62; former Ocean Pacific president bridged surf industry and Wall Street|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/obituaries/la-me-dick-baker16-2009apr16,0,648591.story|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|publisher=|date=2009-04-16|accessdate=2009-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

===Early life===
Baker was born on September 3, 1946 in Los Angeles.&lt;ref name=lat/&gt; He grew up in the [[San Fernando Valley]] and earned his bachelor's degree from  [[California State University, Northridge]].&lt;ref name=lat/&gt;

===Career===
Baker first entered the apparel industry as a college student.  He became a [[buyer]] at a men's specialty store to pay for school.&lt;ref name=lat/&gt; He later became a buyer for the now defunct [[Bullock's]] [[department store]].&lt;ref name=lat/&gt;

Baker became head of the [[Marithé François Girbaud]]'s U.S. division, based in [[New York City]], in 1980.&lt;ref name=lat/&gt; He gradually moved on to head other clothing brands.  In 1983, Baker became the president and [[chief executive]] of [[Izod|Izod Ltd]].'s [[Fashion|menswear]] division.&lt;ref name=lat/&gt; He became president of [[Esprit Sport]] in 1986 before later moving on to become the head of [[Tommy Hilfiger]]'s women's clothing division.&lt;ref name=lat/&gt;

===Ocean Pacific===
In 1998, Baker and his partners at the Doyle &amp; Boissiere investment group, which is based in [[Burlingame, California]], acquired the [[Ocean Pacific]] heritage surf [[brand]].&lt;ref name=lat/&gt; Ocean Pacific was in financial trouble at the time as [[consumer preference]]s had changed over the years.

Baker became the chief executive of Ocean Pacific following the 1998 acquisition.&lt;ref name=lat/&gt; He was able to successfully revive the flagging label.  Under his helm, Baker led Ocean Pacific through two sales.  The first was to [[Warnaco Group]] in 2004, which acquired Ocean Pacific for $40 million.&lt;ref name=lat/&gt; The second sale, in 2006, was to [[Iconix Brand Group]], a [[surf wear]] maker, for an estimated $54 million.&lt;ref name=lat/&gt;

Baker remained the president of Ocean Pacific until he stepped down in 2006, and continued as a [[consultant]] with the company until 2007.&lt;ref name=lat/&gt;

===Surf Industry Manufacturers Association===
Baker joined the board of directors of the [[Surf Industry Manufacturers Association]] ([[SIMA]]), based in [[Aliso Viejo, California]], in 2000 while he was the chief executive of Ocean Pacific.&lt;ref name=lat/&gt; He served as the head of SIMA for nine years before becoming the chairman [[emeritus]] of the organization.&lt;ref name=lat/&gt; The ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' noted that as head of SIMA, Baker directed the business of "selling [[Surfing|surf]] to the suits" in the larger business community.&lt;ref name=lat/&gt; He also served as a mentor to the CEOs and heads of other surf oriented apparel brands. [[Fernando Aguerre]], the co-founder of [[Reef (company)|Reef]] clothing company and current chief executive of [[Liquid Tribe]], later called Baker, "part father, part brother and part friend."&lt;ref name=lat/&gt;

In a speech to a surf insutry gathering in  [[San José del Cabo]], [[Mexico]], in May 2005, Baker told attendees that, "Surf is on the [[world stage]], and this hard-core, laid-back industry has been discovered by the suits. The non- endemic business types see this as an area of growth, and if you see this as a threat, then get a life -- it's a compliment."&lt;ref name=lat/&gt;

Baker also told the surf industry to use their influence to do good works saying in 2006, "Pick your spot and make a difference...Whether you're big or small, give back what you can."&lt;ref name=lat/&gt;

===Death===
Richard Baker died on April 14, 2009, at [[Mission Hospital]] in [[Mission Viejo, California]], after a two-year battle with cancer.&lt;ref name=lat/&gt; He was 62 years old and was survived by his wife of 19 years, Una Baker; sons, Ryan and Jack; his father, Donald Baker, and his sister, Donna Smith Vigil.&lt;ref name=lat/&gt;

The Surf Industry Manufacturers Association announced that its plans to honor Baker with its Lifetime Achievement Award at its 20th annual [[Waterman's Ball]] in August 2009.&lt;ref name=lat/&gt;

[[Richard Woolcott]], the founder and CEO of [[Volcom]] told the ''LA Times'', "Dick was a great friend, [[mentor]] and [[role model]] to many of us in the industry. He understood the magic of [[action sports]] and helped us harness it into big-picture thinking and execution. But most of all, he was a wonderful human being with a loving heart and spirit. He was always supportive in what we were doing, lending his advice and positive feedback. He was a blessing to this industry and will be deeply missed."&lt;ref name=lat/&gt;

Fernando Aguerre, founder of Reef, said in reaction to Baker's death, "And I feel like an orphan today."&lt;ref name=lat/&gt;

In the last few years of his life, Rockefeller was working to establish better worldwide methods of treatment for individuals suffering from [[post-traumatic stress disorder]].&lt;ref name="bloomberg"/&gt;

He also served as chairman of the board of Maine Coast Heritage Trust from 2000 to 2006.&lt;ref name="bloomberg"/&gt; Rockefeller served as president of the [[Rockefeller Brothers Fund]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rbf.org/people/richard-rockefeller Richard Rockefeller | Rockefeller Brothers Fund]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Rockefeller, an experienced pilot, was flying home after visiting his father at the Rockefeller family estate in [[Pocantico Hills, New York|Pocantico Hills]], a hamlet in the town of [[Mount Pleasant, New York]]. The family patriarch, his father, [[David Rockefeller]], had celebrated his 99th birthday on June 12, 2014.&lt;ref name="Berger2014"/&gt;

Rockefeller took off from [[Westchester County Airport]] in a [[Piper PA-46#PA-46-500TP Malibu Meridian|Piper Meridian]] single-engine [[turboprop]] at 8:08&amp;nbsp;a.m. on June 13, 2014, departing from runway 16 in dense fog and steady rain. Less than 10 minutes later, the Federal Aviation Administration notified airport officials it had lost contact with the pilot. At 8:23&amp;nbsp;a.m. local police in the town of [[Harrison, New York]] reported Rockefeller's plane crashed less than a mile from the airport in the town of Harrison. Rockefeller, the pilot, was the only person on the private plane.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/14/nyregion/richard-rockefeller-killed-in-new-york-plane-crash.html?_r=0/ Son of David Rockefeller Dies in Small-Plane Crash] ''The New York Times''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/06/13/us-usa-new-york-crash-idUSKBN0EO1DE20140613 Rockefeller heir killed in small plane crash near New York City | Reuters]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2014/06/13/us/richard-rockefeller-plane-crash/ Richard Rockefeller, great-grandson of John D. Rockefeller, dies in plane crash - CNN]&lt;/ref&gt;

The cause of the crash was attributed to the pilot's failure to maintain a positive climb rate after takeoff due to spatial disorientation ([[Sensory illusions in aviation#Vestibular.2Fsomatogravic illusions|somatogravic illusion]]).&lt;ref&gt;http://app.ntsb.gov/pdfgenerator/ReportGeneratorFile.ashx?EventID=20140613X91656&amp;AKey=1&amp;RType=Final&amp;IType=FA&lt;/ref&gt;

Richard is the only one of six siblings to have died during his father's lifetime. Through him, he was also a nephew of the late U.S. Vice President [[Nelson Rockefeller]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7673">'''Roger De Clerck''' (July 27, 1924 – October 23, 2015) was a Belgian entrepreneur and CEO of the [[Beaulieu International Group|Beaulieu textile group]]. An international business man, his family was ranked 15th place in a list of "richest Belgians".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://derijkstebelgen.be/vermogende/familie-de-clerck/|title=Familie De Clerck - De Rijkste Belgen|work=De Rijkste Belgen}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his lifetime he was controversial due to a series of scandals where he and his company were accused of [[fiscal fraud]].

==Biography==

De Clerck born in  [[Wielsbeke]], the second son of a [[flax]] farmer who owned a large farm, "Ter Lembeek" there. His two brothers became priests.&lt;ref name="nieuwsblad.be"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nieuwsblad.be/cnt/dma28012005_026|title=Dallas in Vlaanderen: de familie Beaulieu|work=Het Nieuwsblad}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a nephew of minister {{Interlanguage link multi|Albert De Clerck|nl}} (father of politician [[Stefaan De Clerck]]) and the brother of Thérèse De Clerck, wife of {{Interlanguage link multi|Willy De Nolf|nl}}, founder of [[Roularta]].

In 1951 De Clerck married Anne-Marie Hanssens from [[Gullegem]].&lt;ref name="nieuwsblad.be"/&gt; In normal circumstances he would have taken over his father's farm, but the [[flax]] market collapsed around this time and he was forced to look for another source of income. De Clerck decided to produce [[loom]]s and later [[carpet]]s. In 1959 he founded the carpet company "Beaulieu", which became an international trader in the next few decades. He also became a politically active member of the [[Christelijke Volkspartij|CVP]].&lt;ref name="nieuwsblad.be"/&gt;

In 1991, because of internal struggles between his heirs, De Clerck divided his empire among them. Jan De Clerck received ''Domo''. Luc became head of ''Berry Group''. Mieke of ''[[Associated Weavers]]''. Francis ''[[Ideal Group]]''. Ann ''Beaulieu Kruishoutem'' and Dominiek ''Ter Lembeek''. Five of his six children kept their head department in Belgium, only Mieke moved hers to the USA.

In 1992 Jan De Clerck's eleven-year-old son, Anthony De Clerck, was kidnapped by the gang of [[Danny Vanhamel]]. A [[ransom]] of 250 million Belgian francs was demanded, but after a month Anthony was freed and the kidnappers arrested.&lt;ref name="nieuwsblad.be"/&gt;

During the 1990s and 2000s ''Beaulieu'' felt more rivalry from foreign companies. In 2005 four branches of the company were merged into one company ''Beaulieu International Group'', which is still the largest West European carpet group. The only branches that were kept out were ''Domo'' (because Jan had fallen into dishonor with his father) and ''Beaulieu in America'' (which Mieke preferred to keep independent). At this point none of the De Clercks was part of the daily management and in October 2005 De Clerck himself also stepped down.

==Scandals==

In 1987 Roger De Clerck had his first run-in with the law. He was suspected of having exported large fortune from his companies to foreign counties under the veil of commission fees. A money export of about 1,5 to 2 billion Belgian francs were traced. He was found guilty, but his punishment was dismissed because his social position and the employment of his personnel could become endangered. In 1989 five business employees, including his sons Jan and Dominiek, spent a week in jail in England, because they had sold their carpets in black market money.&lt;ref name="nieuwsblad.be"/&gt; Couriers smuggled the money in their clothing and luggage to Belgium. Two years later De Clerck bought his sons off with 2 million euro, without any prosecution or conviction coming about.

In 1997 Jan De Clerck and his partner Martine Van De Weghe were arrested. An associate of Jan, Ronny Verhoeven - who was a banker at [[Generale Bank]] in [[Sint-Niklaas]] - had whitewashed black market money through fake commission fees and bills. Verhoeven admitted this fraud in September 1997. In April 1998 Jan De Clerck was forced to do the same. Him and his wife admitted the fraud and paid 2,5 million euro.&lt;ref name="nieuwsblad.be"/&gt; A year later they paid another 50 million euro to pay off their overdue personnel taxes and venture taxes. This caused a drift between them and the rest of the family, who kept repeating they were innocent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.knack.be/nieuws/belgie/bijzondere-belastingsinspectie-en-beaulieu-blijven-bikkelen/article-normal-91030.html|title=Bijzondere Belastingsinspectie en Beaulieu blijven bikkelen|work=knack.be}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roger De Clerck himself was suspected from [[false document|forgery of documents]], gang organisation and violation of the laws for venture taxes.&lt;ref name="nieuwsblad.be"/&gt; He was also thought to have tried to bribe investigation judges and researchers. The Beaulieu group was thought to have had paid fake commission payments to a Libanese business family for years.&lt;ref name="nieuwsblad.be"/&gt; They officially acted as middle man for the sales in the Middle-East and Russia, but according to the researchers they were simply [[straw men]]. Their commission payments on sold products were meant to scoop off the profits of the Beaulieu branches and were returned to the family in the shape of loans, investments or black market money. The case kept going for years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hln.be/hln/nl/957/Binnenland/article/detail/1326161/2011/09/29/Staat-legt-zich-nog-niet-neer-bij-fraudezaak-Beaulieu.dhtml|title=Staat legt zich nog niet neer bij fraudezaak Beaulieu|work=HLN}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2014 it was revealed that a new research was started to clear out suspicions of [[whitewashing]] in a Luxembourgian venture. Business shares which belonged to a Libanese businessman were carried over to the De Clerck family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.knack.be/nieuws/belgie/nieuw-fraudeonderzoek-tegen-beaulieu-en-familie-de-clerck/article-normal-140737.html|title=Nieuw fraudeonderzoek tegen Beaulieu en familie De Clerck|work=knack.be}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reputation==

Despite his massive wealth and large company imperium De Clerck was often nicknamed "Boer Clerck" ("Farmer Clerck") in the media, because of his roots in the farming industry, his local dialect and his simple-minded behavior. He detested this nickname himself.&lt;ref name="nieuwsblad.be"/&gt;

In 1999 De Clerck celebrated his 75th birthday. This event attracted a lot of press attention when he invited world-famous politicians to meet him at his garden party, including [[Margaret Thatcher]] and [[George H.W. Bush]].&lt;ref name="nieuwsblad.be"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.margaretthatcher.org/speeches/displaydocument.asp?docid=109300|title=Remarks at Roger De Clerck's Birthday Party|work=margaretthatcher.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] was invited too, but had to excuse himself because his wife, [[Raisa Gorbachev]], was seriously ill. She would die that same year. De Clerck's son Jan was not invited because he had fallen into disgrace.

==Death==

De Clerck died in 2015 at the age of 91.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tijd.be/ondernemen/textiel/Roger_De_Clerck_is_overleden.9690659-3117.art?ckc=1&amp;ts=1445588859|title=Roger De Clerck is overleden|work=Tijd.be}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deredactie.be/cm/vrtnieuws.english/News/1.2476716|title=One of Flanders’ most well-known entrepreneurs dies aged 91|work=flandersnews.be}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[computing]], '''scheduling''' is the method by which work specified by some means is assigned to resources that complete the work.  The work may be virtual computation elements such as [[thread (computer science)|threads]], [[process (computing)|processes]] or data [[flow (computer networking)|flows]], which are in turn scheduled onto hardware resources such as [[central processing unit|processors]], [[telecommunications link|network links]] or [[expansion card]]s.

A scheduler is what carries out the scheduling activity.  Schedulers are often implemented so they keep all computer resources busy (as in [[load balancing (computing)|load balancing]]), allow multiple users to share system resources effectively, or to achieve a target [[quality of service]].  Scheduling is fundamental to computation itself, and an intrinsic part of the [[execution model]] of a computer system; the concept of scheduling makes it possible to have [[computer multitasking]] with a single [[central processing unit]] (CPU).

A scheduler may aim at one or more of many goals, for example: 
&lt;!-- throughput --&gt;
maximizing ''[[throughput]]'' (the total amount of work completed per time unit); 
&lt;!-- wait time --&gt;
minimizing  ''[[Computer performance#Response time|wait time]]'' 
(time from work becoming enabled until the first point it begins execution on resources); 
&lt;!-- response_time/latency for batch systems --&gt;
minimizing ''[[latency (engineering)|latency]]'' or ''[[Response time (technology)|response time]]'' (time from work becoming enabled until it is finished in case of batch activity,&lt;ref name="liu1973"&gt;{{Cite journal

Often, a process can produce some output fairly early and can continue computing new results while previous results are being output to the user.

This measure, called response time, is the time it takes to start responding, not the time it takes to output the response.

&lt;!-- fairness --&gt;
or maximizing ''fairness'' (equal CPU time to each process, or more generally appropriate times according to the priority and workload of each process).  In practice, these goals often conflict (e.g. throughput versus latency), thus a scheduler will implement a suitable compromise.  Preference is measured by any one of the concerns mentioned above, depending upon the user's needs and objectives.

In [[real-time computing|real-time]] environments, such as [[embedded system]]s for [[automatic control]] in industry (for example [[robotics]]), the scheduler also must ensure that processes can meet [[time limit|deadlines]]; this is crucial for keeping the system stable. Scheduled tasks can also be distributed to remote devices across a network and [[device Management|managed]] through an administrative back end.

=={{Anchor|SCHEDULER}}Types of operating system schedulers==
{{See also|Network scheduler|I/O scheduling|Job scheduler}}

The scheduler is an operating system module that selects the next jobs to be admitted into the system and the next process to run. Operating systems may feature up to three distinct scheduler types: a ''long-term scheduler'' (also known as an admission scheduler or high-level scheduler), a ''mid-term or medium-term scheduler'', and a ''short-term scheduler''. The names suggest the relative frequency with which their functions are performed.

==={{Anchor|PROCESS}}Process scheduler===
The process scheduler is a part of the operating system that decides which process runs at a certain point in time. It usually has the ability to pause a running process, move it to the back of the running queue and start a new process; such a scheduler is known as ''[[Preemption (computing)|preemptive]] scheduler'', otherwise it is a ''[[Nonpreemptive multitasking|cooperative]] scheduler''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===={{Anchor|LONG-TERM}}Long-term scheduling====
The ''long-term scheduler'', or ''admission scheduler'', decides which jobs or processes are to be admitted to the ready queue (in main memory); that is, when an attempt is made to execute a program, its admission to the set of currently executing processes is either authorized or delayed by the long-term scheduler. Thus, this scheduler dictates what processes are to run on a system, and the degree of concurrency to be supported at any one time{{snd}} whether many or few processes are to be executed concurrently, and how the split between I/O-intensive and CPU-intensive processes is to be handled. The long-term scheduler is responsible for controlling the degree of multiprogramming.

In general, most processes can be described as either [[I/O-bound]] or [[CPU-bound]]. An I/O-bound process is one that spends more of its time doing I/O than it spends doing computations. A CPU-bound process, in contrast, generates I/O requests infrequently, using more of its time doing computations. It is important that a long-term scheduler selects a good process mix of I/O-bound and CPU-bound processes. If all processes are I/O-bound, the ready queue will almost always be empty, and the short-term scheduler will have little to do. On the other hand, if all processes are CPU-bound, the I/O waiting queue will almost always be empty, devices will go unused, and again the system will be unbalanced. The system with the best performance will thus have a combination of CPU-bound and I/O-bound processes. In modern operating systems, this is used to make sure that real-time processes get enough CPU time to finish their tasks.&lt;ref name="galvin"&gt;{{cite book
| authors = [[Abraham Silberschatz]], Peter Baer Galvin and Greg Gagne
| title = Operating System Concepts
| volume = 9
| year= 2013
| publisher= John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.
| isbn= 978-1-118-06333-0
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Long-term scheduling is also important in large-scale systems such as [[batch processing]] systems, [[computer cluster]]s, [[supercomputer]]s, and [[render farm]]s. For example, in [[concurrent computing|concurrent systems]], [[coscheduling]] of interacting processes is often required to prevent them from blocking due to waiting on each other. In these cases, special-purpose [[job scheduler]] software is typically used to assist these functions, in addition to any underlying admission scheduling support in the operating system.

===={{Anchor|MEDIUM-TERM}}Medium-term scheduling====
The ''medium-term scheduler'' temporarily removes processes from main memory and places them in secondary memory (such as a [[hard disk drive]]) or vice versa, which is commonly referred to as "swapping out" or "swapping in" (also incorrectly as "[[paging]] out" or "paging in").  The medium-term scheduler may decide to swap out a process which has not been active for some time, or a process which has a low priority, or a process which is [[page fault]]ing frequently, or a process which is taking up a large amount of memory in order to free up main memory for other processes, swapping the process back in later when more memory is available, or when the process has been unblocked and is no longer waiting for a resource.  [Stallings, 396]  [Stallings, 370]

In many systems today (those that support mapping virtual address space to secondary storage other than the swap file), the medium-term scheduler may actually perform the role of the long-term scheduler, by treating binaries as "swapped out processes" upon their execution.  In this way, when a segment of the binary is required it can be swapped in on demand, or "lazy loaded".  [Stallings, 394]

===={{Anchor|SHORT-TERM}}Short-term scheduling====
The ''short-term scheduler'' (also known as the ''CPU scheduler'') decides which of the ready, in-memory processes is to be executed (allocated a CPU) after a clock [[interrupt]], an I/O interrupt, an operating [[system call]] or another form of [[Signal programming|signal]].  Thus the short-term scheduler makes scheduling decisions much more frequently than the long-term or mid-term schedulers{{snd}}a scheduling decision will at a minimum have to be made after every time slice, and these are very short.  This scheduler can be [[Preemption (computing)|preemptive]], implying that it is capable of forcibly removing processes from a CPU when it decides to allocate that CPU to another process, or non-preemptive (also known as "voluntary" or "co-operative"), in which case the scheduler is unable to "force" processes off the CPU.

A preemptive scheduler relies upon a [[programmable interval timer]] which invokes an [[interrupt handler]] that runs in [[kernel mode]] and implements the scheduling function.

===={{Anchor|DISPATCH-LATENCY}}Dispatcher====
Another component that is involved in the CPU-scheduling function is the dispatcher, which is the module that gives control of the CPU to the process selected by the short-term scheduler. It receives control in kernel mode as the result of an interrupt or system call. The functions of a dispatcher involve the following:

* [[Context switch]]es, in which the dispatcher saves the [[State (computer science)|state]] (also known as [[Context (computing)|context]]) of the [[Process (computing)|process]] or [[Thread (computing)|thread]] that was previously running; the dispatcher then loads the initial or previously saved state of the new process.
* Switching to user mode.
* Jumping to the proper location in the user program to restart that program indicated by its new state.

The dispatcher should be as fast as possible, since it is invoked during every process switch. During the context switches, the processor is virtually idle for a fraction of time, thus unnecessary context switches should be avoided. The time it takes for the dispatcher to stop one process and start another is known as the ''dispatch latency''.&lt;ref name="galvin" /&gt;{{rp|155}}

==Scheduling disciplines==
Scheduling disciplines are algorithms used for distributing resources among parties which simultaneously and asynchronously request them. Scheduling disciplines are used in [[router (computing)|router]]s (to handle packet traffic) as well as in [[operating system]]s (to share [[CPU time]] among both [[thread (computer science)|threads]] and [[process (computing)|processes]]), disk drives ([[I/O scheduling]]), printers ([[print spooler]]), most embedded systems, etc.

The main purposes of scheduling algorithms are to minimize [[resource starvation]] and to ensure fairness amongst the parties utilizing the resources. Scheduling deals with the problem of deciding which of the outstanding requests is to be allocated resources. There are many different scheduling algorithms. In this section, we introduce several of them.

In [[packet-switched]] [[computer networks]] and other [[statistical multiplexing]], the notion of a '''scheduling algorithm''' is used as an alternative to [[FIFO (computing and electronics)|first-come first-served]] queuing of data packets.

The simplest best-effort scheduling algorithms are [[round-robin scheduling|round-robin]], [[fair queuing]] (a [[max-min fair]] scheduling algorithm), [[proportionally fair]] scheduling and [[maximum throughput scheduling|maximum throughput]]. If differentiated or guaranteed [[quality of service]] is offered, as opposed to best-effort communication, [[weighted fair queuing]] may be utilized.

In advanced packet radio wireless networks such as [[HSDPA]] (High-Speed Downlink Packet Access) [[3.5G]] cellular system, '''channel-dependent scheduling''' may be used to take advantage of [[channel state information]]. If the channel conditions are favourable, the [[throughput]] and [[system spectral efficiency]] may be increased. In even more advanced systems such as [[LTE Advanced|LTE]], the scheduling is combined by channel-dependent packet-by-packet [[dynamic channel allocation]], or by assigning [[OFDMA]] multi-carriers or other [[frequency-domain equalization]] components to the users that best can utilize them.&lt;ref name=Miao&gt;{{cite book|author1=[[Guowang Miao]]|author2=Jens Zander|author3=Ki Won Sung|author4=Ben Slimane|title=Fundamentals of Mobile Data Networks|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|isbn=1107143217|year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===First come, first served===
{{Main article|FIFO (computing and electronics)}}

[[File:Thread pool.svg|thumb|400px|A sample [[thread pool]] (green boxes) with a queue (FIFO) of waiting tasks (blue) and a queue of completed tasks (yellow)]]

''First in, first out'' ([[FIFO (computing and electronics)|FIFO]]), also known as ''first come, first served'' (FCFS), is the simplest scheduling algorithm. FIFO simply queues processes in the order that they arrive in the ready queue. This is commonly used for a '''{{visible anchor|task queue}}''', for example as illustrated in this section.

* Since context switches only occur upon process termination, and no reorganization of the process queue is required, scheduling overhead is minimal.
* Throughput can be low, because long processes can be holding CPU, waiting the short processes for a long time (known as convoy effect).
* No starvation, because each process gets chance to be executed after a definite time.
* [[Turnaround time]], waiting time and response time depends on the order of their arrival and can be high for the same reasons above.
* No prioritization occurs, thus this system has trouble meeting process deadlines.
* The lack of prioritization means that as long as every process eventually completes, there is no starvation. In an environment where some processes might not complete, there can be starvation.
* It is based on queuing.

===Priority scheduling===
{{Main article|Earliest deadline first scheduling}}
{{See also|Deadline-monotonic scheduling|}}
Earliest deadline first (EDF) or ''least time to go'' is a dynamic scheduling algorithm used in real-time operating systems to place processes in a priority queue. Whenever a scheduling event occurs (a task finishes, new task is released, etc.), the queue will be searched for the process closest to its deadline, which will be the next to be scheduled for execution.

===Shortest remaining time first ===
{{Main article|Shortest remaining time}}

Similar to [[shortest job first]] (SJF). With this strategy the scheduler arranges processes with the least estimated processing time remaining to be next in the queue. This requires advanced knowledge or estimations about the time required for a process to complete.

* If a shorter process arrives during another process' execution, the currently running process is interrupted (known as preemption), dividing that process into two separate computing blocks. This creates excess overhead through additional context switching. The scheduler must also place each incoming process into a specific place in the queue, creating additional overhead.
* This algorithm is designed for maximum throughput in most scenarios.
* Waiting time and response time increase as the process's computational requirements increase. Since turnaround time is based on waiting time plus processing time, longer processes are significantly affected by this. Overall waiting time is smaller than FIFO, however since no process has to wait for the termination of the longest process.
* No particular attention is given to deadlines, the programmer can only attempt to make processes with deadlines as short as possible.
* Starvation is possible, especially in a busy system with many small processes being run.
* To use this policy we should have at least two processes of different priority

===Fixed priority pre-emptive scheduling===
{{Main article|Fixed priority pre-emptive scheduling}}

The operating system assigns a fixed priority rank to every process, and the scheduler arranges the processes in the ready queue in order of their priority.  Lower-priority processes get interrupted by incoming higher-priority processes.
* Overhead is not minimal, nor is it significant.
* FPPS has no particular advantage in terms of throughput over FIFO scheduling.
* If the number of rankings is limited, it can be characterized as a collection of FIFO queues, one for each priority ranking.  Processes in lower-priority queues are selected only when all of the higher-priority queues are empty.
* Waiting time and response time depend on the priority of the process.  Higher-priority processes have smaller waiting and response times.
* Deadlines can be met by giving processes with deadlines a higher priority.
* Starvation of lower-priority processes is possible with large numbers of high-priority processes queuing for CPU time.

===Round-robin scheduling===
{{Main article|Round-robin scheduling}}

The scheduler assigns a fixed time unit per process, and cycles through them. If process completes within that time-slice it gets terminated otherwise it is rescheduled after giving a chance to all other processes.

* RR scheduling involves extensive overhead, especially with a small time unit.
* Balanced throughput between FCFS/ FIFO and SJF/SRTF, shorter jobs are completed faster than in FIFO and longer processes are completed faster than in SJF.
* Good average response time, waiting time is dependent on number of processes, and not average process length.
* Because of high waiting times, deadlines are rarely met in a pure RR system.
* Starvation can never occur, since no priority is given. Order of time unit allocation is based upon process arrival time, similar to FIFO.
* If Time-Slice is large it becomes FCFS /FIFO or if it is short then it becomes SJF/SRTF.

===Multilevel queue scheduling===
{{Main article|Multilevel queue}}

This is used for situations in which processes are easily divided into different groups. For example, a common division is made between foreground (interactive) processes and background (batch) processes. These two types of processes have different response-time requirements and so may have different scheduling needs. It is very useful for shared memory problems.

===Work-conserving schedulers===
{{Main article|Work-conserving scheduler}}

A [[work-conserving scheduler]] is a scheduler that always tries to keep the scheduled resources busy, if there are submitted jobs ready to be scheduled. In contrast, a non-work conserving scheduler is a scheduler that, in some cases, may leave the scheduled resources idle despite the presence of jobs ready to be scheduled.

===Scheduling optimization problems===
There are several scheduling problems in which the goal is to decide which job goes to which station at what time, such that the total [[makespan]] is minimized:
* [[Job shop scheduling]]{{snd}} there are {{mvar|n}} jobs and {{mvar|m}} identical stations. Each job should be executed on a single machine. This is usually regarded as an online problem.
* [[Open-shop scheduling]]{{snd}} there are {{mvar|n}} jobs and {{mvar|m}} different stations. Each job should spend some time at each station, in a free order.
* [[Flow shop scheduling]]{{snd}} there are {{mvar|n}} jobs and {{mvar|m}} different stations. Each job should spend some time at each station, in a pre-determined order.

===Manual scheduling===
A very common method in embedded systems is to schedule jobs manually. This can for example be done in a time-multiplexed fashion. Sometimes the kernel is divided in three or more parts: Manual scheduling, preemptive and interrupt level. Exact methods for scheduling jobs are often proprietary.

* No resource starvation problems
* Very high predictability; allows implementation of hard real-time systems
* Almost no overhead
* May not be optimal for all applications
* Effectiveness is completely dependent on the implementation

===Choosing a scheduling algorithm===
When designing an operating system, a programmer must consider which scheduling algorithm will perform best for the use the system is going to see. There is no universal “best” scheduling algorithm, and many operating systems use extended or combinations of the scheduling algorithms above.

For example, [[Windows NT]]/XP/Vista uses a [[multilevel feedback queue]], a combination of fixed-priority preemptive scheduling, round-robin, and first in, first out algorithms. In this system, threads can dynamically increase or decrease in priority depending on if it has been serviced already, or if it has been waiting extensively. Every priority level is represented by its own queue, with [[round-robin scheduling]] among the high-priority threads and [[FIFO (computing and electronics)|FIFO]] among the lower-priority ones. In this sense, response time is short for most threads, and short but critical system threads get completed very quickly. Since threads can only use one time unit of the round-robin in the highest-priority queue, starvation can be a problem for longer high-priority threads.

==Operating system process scheduler implementations==
The algorithm used may be as simple as [[Round-robin scheduling|round-robin]] in which each process is given equal time (for instance 1&amp;nbsp;ms, usually between 1&amp;nbsp;ms and 100&amp;nbsp;ms) in a cycling list. So, process A executes for 1&amp;nbsp;ms, then process B, then process C, then back to process A.

More advanced algorithms take into account process priority, or the importance of the process.  This allows some processes to use more time than other processes. The kernel always uses whatever resources it needs to ensure proper functioning of the system, and so can be said to have infinite priority. In [[Symmetric multiprocessing|SMP]](symmetric multiprocessing) systems, [[processor affinity]] is considered to increase overall system performance, even if it may cause a process itself to run more slowly.  This generally improves performance by reducing [[cache thrashing]].

===OS/360 and successors===
IBM [[OS/360 and successors|OS/360]] was available with three different schedulers.  The differences were such that the variants were often considered three different operating systems:

* The ''Single Sequential Scheduler'' option, also known as the ''Primary Control Program (PCP)'' provided sequential execution of a single stream of jobs.
* The ''Multiple Sequential Scheduler'' option, known as ''Multiprogramming with a Fixed Number of Tasks (MFT)'' provided execution of multiple concurrent jobs.  Execution was governed by a priority which had a default for each stream or could be requested separately for each job.  MFT version II added subtasks (threads), which executed at a priority based on that of the parent job.  Each job stream defined the maximum amount of memory which could be used by any job in that stream.
* The ''Multiple Priority Schedulers'' option, or ''Multiprogramming with a Variable Number of Tasks (MVT)'', featured subtasks from the start; each job requested the priority and memory it required before execution.

Later virtual storage versions of MVS added a ''[[Workload Manager]]'' feature to the scheduler, which schedules processor resources according to an elaborate scheme defined by the installation.

===Windows===
Very early [[MS-DOS]] and Microsoft Windows systems were non-multitasking, and as such did not feature a scheduler. [[Windows 3.1x]] used a non-preemptive scheduler, meaning that it did not interrupt programs. It relied on the program to end or tell the OS that it didn't need the processor so that it could move on to another process. This is usually called cooperative multitasking. Windows 95 introduced a rudimentary preemptive scheduler; however, for legacy support opted to let 16 bit applications run without preemption.&lt;ref&gt;{{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/*/www.jgcampbell.com/caos/html/node13.html |date=* |title=Early Windows }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Windows NT]]-based operating systems use a multilevel feedback queue. 32 priority levels are defined, 0 through to 31, with priorities 0 through 15 being "normal" priorities and priorities 16 through 31 being soft real-time priorities, requiring privileges to assign. 0 is reserved for the Operating System. Users can select 5 of these priorities to assign to a running application from the Task Manager application, or through thread management APIs. The kernel may change the priority level of a thread depending on its I/O and CPU usage and whether it is interactive (i.e. accepts and responds to input from humans), raising the priority of interactive and I/O bounded processes and lowering that of CPU bound processes, to increase the responsiveness of interactive applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Tale of Two Schedulers Windows NT and Windows CE |url=http://sriramk.com/schedulers.html |author=Sriram Krishnan |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120722015555/http://sriramk.com/schedulers.html |archivedate=July 22, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The scheduler was modified in [[Windows Vista]] to use the [[Time Stamp Counter|cycle counter register]] of modern processors to keep track of exactly how many CPU cycles a thread has executed, rather than just using an interval-timer interrupt routine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc162494.aspx |title=Windows Administration: Inside the Windows Vista Kernel: Part 1 |website=Technet.microsoft.com |date=2016-11-14 |accessdate=2016-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vista also uses a priority scheduler for the I/O queue so that disk defragmenters and other such programs do not interfere with foreground operations.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080219174631/http://blog.gabefrost.com/?p=25 ]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Classic Mac OS and macOS===
Mac OS 9 uses cooperative scheduling for threads, where one process controls multiple cooperative threads, and also provides preemptive scheduling for multiprocessing tasks. The kernel schedules multiprocessing tasks using a preemptive scheduling algorithm. All Process Manager processes run within a special multiprocessing task, called the "blue task". Those processes are scheduled cooperatively, using a [[round-robin scheduling]] algorithm; a process yields control of the processor to another process by explicitly calling a {{req|blocking function}} such as &lt;code&gt;WaitNextEvent&lt;/code&gt;. Each process has its own copy of the [[Thread Manager]] that schedules that process's threads cooperatively; a thread yields control of the processor to another thread by calling &lt;code&gt;YieldToAnyThread&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;YieldToThread&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;ref name=appletn2028&gt;{{cite web|url=https://developer.apple.com/technotes/tn/tn2028.html |title=Technical Notes |website=Developer.apple.com |date= |accessdate=2016-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

macOS uses a multilevel feedback queue, with four priority bands for threads{{snd}}normal, system high priority, kernel mode only, and real-time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://developer.apple.com/mac/library/documentation/Darwin/Conceptual/KernelProgramming/scheduler/scheduler.html |title=Guides and Sample Code |website=Developer.apple.com |date= |accessdate=2016-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Threads are scheduled preemptively; macOS also supports cooperatively scheduled threads in its implementation of the Thread Manager in [[Carbon (API)|Carbon]].&lt;ref name=appletn2028/&gt;

===AIX===
In AIX Version 4 there are three possible values for thread scheduling policy:

* First In, First Out: Once a thread with this policy is scheduled, it runs to completion unless it is blocked, it voluntarily yields control of the CPU, or a higher-priority thread becomes dispatchable. Only fixed-priority threads can have a FIFO scheduling policy.
* Round Robin: This is similar to the AIX Version 3 scheduler round-robin scheme based on 10ms time slices. When a RR thread has control at the end of the time slice, it moves to the tail of the queue of dispatchable threads of its priority. Only fixed-priority threads can have a Round Robin scheduling policy.
* OTHER: This policy is defined by POSIX1003.4a as implementation-defined. In AIX Version 4, this policy is defined to be equivalent to RR, except that it applies to threads with non-fixed priority. The recalculation of the running thread's priority value at each clock interrupt means that a thread may lose control because its priority value has risen above that of another dispatchable thread. This is the AIX Version 3 behavior.

Threads are primarily of interest for applications that currently consist of several asynchronous processes. These applications might impose a lighter load on the system if converted to a multithreaded structure.

AIX 5 implements the following scheduling policies: FIFO, round robin, and a fair round robin. The FIFO policy has three different implementations: FIFO, FIFO2, and FIFO3. The round robin policy is named SCHED_RR in AIX, and the fair round robin is called SCHED_OTHER.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/aix/library/au-aix5_cpu/index.html#N100F6]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811094049/http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/aix/library/au-aix5_cpu/index.html |date=2011-08-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Linux===
[[File:Simplified Structure of the Linux Kernel.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|A highly simplified structure of the Linux kernel, which includes process schedulers, I/O schedulers, and [[Linux kernel packet scheduler|packet schedulers]] ]]

====Linux 2.4====
In [[Linux]] 2.4, an [[O(n) scheduler]] with a [[multilevel feedback queue]] with priority levels ranging from 0 to 140 was used; 0&amp;ndash;99 are reserved for real-time tasks and 100&amp;ndash;140 are considered [[nice (Unix)|nice]] task levels. For real-time tasks, the time quantum for switching processes was approximately 200&amp;nbsp;ms, and for nice tasks approximately 10 ms.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} The scheduler ran through the [[run queue]] of all ready processes, letting the highest priority processes go first and run through their time slices, after which they will be placed in an expired queue. When the active queue is empty the expired queue will become the active queue and vice versa.

However, some enterprise [[Linux distributions]] such as [[SUSE Linux Enterprise Server]] replaced this scheduler with a backport of the [[O(1) scheduler]] (which was maintained by [[Alan Cox]] in his Linux 2.4-ac Kernel series) to the Linux 2.4 kernel used by the distribution.

====Linux 2.6.0 to Linux 2.6.22====
In versions 2.6.0 to 2.6.22, the kernel used an [[O(1) scheduler]] developed by [[Ingo Molnar]] and many other kernel developers during the Linux 2.5 development. For many kernel in time frame, [[Con Kolivas]] developed patch sets which improved interactivity with this scheduler or even replaced it with his own schedulers.

====Since Linux 2.6.23====
Con Kolivas's work, most significantly his implementation of "[[Fair-share scheduling|fair scheduling]]" named "Rotating Staircase Deadline", inspired Ingo Molnár to develop the [[Completely Fair Scheduler]] as a replacement for the earlier [[O(1) scheduler]], crediting Kolivas in his announcement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite mailing list 
       | last=Molnár

       | mailinglist=linux-kernel
       | date=2007-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  CFS is the first implementation of a fair queuing [[process scheduler]] widely used in a general-purpose operating system.&lt;ref name="dwrr"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://happyli.org/tongli/papers/dwrr.pdf|format=PDF|title=Efficient and Scalable Multiprocessor Fair Scheduling Using Distributed Weighted Round-Robin|author1=Tong Li|author2=Dan Baumberger|author3=Scott Hahn|website=Happyli.org|accessdate=2016-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Completely Fair Scheduler]] (CFS) uses a well-studied, classic scheduling algorithm called [[fair queuing]] originally invented for [[packet network]]s. Fair queuing had been previously applied to CPU scheduling under the name [[stride scheduling]].  The fair queuing CFS scheduler has a scheduling complexity of O([[Logarithm|log]] N), where N is the number of tasks in the [[run queue|runqueue]]. Choosing a task can be done in constant time, but reinserting a task after it has run requires O(log N) operations, because the [[run queue]] is implemented as a [[red-black tree]].

The [[Brain Fuck Scheduler]] (BFS), also created by Con Kolivas, is an alternative to the CFS.

===FreeBSD===
[[FreeBSD]] uses a multilevel feedback queue with priorities ranging from 0–255. 0–63 are reserved for interrupts, 64–127 for the top half of the kernel, 128–159 for real-time user threads, 160–223 for time-shared user threads, and 224–255 for idle user threads. Also, like Linux, it uses the active queue setup, but it also has an idle queue.&lt;ref name="opensolaris-queue"&gt;{{cite web|title=Comparison of Solaris, Linux, and FreeBSD Kernels |url=http://cn.opensolaris.org/files/solaris_linux_bsd_cmp.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080807124435/http://cn.opensolaris.org/files/solaris_linux_bsd_cmp.pdf |archivedate=August 7, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===NetBSD===
[[NetBSD]] uses a multilevel feedback queue with priorities ranging from 0–223. 0–63 are reserved for time-shared threads (default, SCHED_OTHER policy), 64–95 for user threads which entered [[kernel space]], 96-128 for kernel threads, 128–191 for user real-time threads (SCHED_FIFO and SCHED_RR policies), and 192–223 for [[Interrupt|software interrupts]].

===Solaris===
[[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]] uses a multilevel feedback queue with priorities ranging between 0 and 169. Priorities 0&amp;ndash;59 are reserved for time-shared threads, 60&amp;ndash;99 for system threads, 100&amp;ndash;159 for real-time threads, and 160&amp;ndash;169 for low priority interrupts. Unlike Linux,&lt;ref name="opensolaris-queue"/&gt; when a process is done using its time quantum, it is given a new priority and put back in the queue. Solaris&amp;nbsp;9 introduced two new scheduling classes, namely fixed priority class and fair share class. The threads with fixed priority have the same priority range as that of the time-sharing class, but their priorities are not dynamically adjusted. The fair scheduling class uses CPU ''shares'' to prioritize threads for scheduling decisions. CPU shares indicate the entitlement to CPU resources. They are allocated to a set of processes, which are collectively known as a project.&lt;ref name="galvin"/&gt;

'''''Selling Blue Elephants: How to Make Great Products That People Want Before They Even Know They Want Them''''' is a book written by [http://www.sellingblueelephants.com/About_us.html Howard Moskowitz] and [http://www.alexgofman.com Alex Gofman] (Publisher: [[Wharton School Publishing]] 2007).

The book outlines a new solution-oriented learning experience co-developed with [[Jerry Wind|Prof. Jerry (Yoram) Wind]] of [[Wharton School of Business]] - [[Rule Developing Experimentation]] (RDE).
 
RDE is the systematized process of designing, testing and modifying alternative ideas, packages, products, or services in a disciplined way so that the developer and marketer discover what appeals to the customer, even if the customer can't articulate the need, much less the solution. The book describes best practices in the RDE from some of today's top companies: [[Hewlett-Packard|HP]], [[Prego]], [[Vlasic Pickles|Vlasic]], [[MasterCard]] and others. Filled with real-life stories, this book changes the way people think about selling to their present and future customers.

The book is currently under contracts to be translated and published in Germany, Italy, Spain (both full and digest), [[Japan]], [[Indonesia]], [[Taiwan]] (Chinese Traditional), China (Chinese Simplified), [[South Korea]], Russia, Netherlands, [[Lebanon]], [[Romania]] (both full and digest), [[Thailand]], India, [[Lithuania]] and [[Vietnam]].

'''Shabtai Shikhman''' ({{Lang-he|שבתאי שיכמן}}, born 10 September 1915, died 9 January 1987) was an [[Israel]]i politician who served as a member of the [[Knesset]] for [[Herut]] and [[Gahal]] between 1959 and 1965.

==Biography==
Born in an area that became [[Poland]], Shikhman joined the [[Betar]] youth movement, and was commander of the branch in his home town. He joined the local branch of [[Hatzohar]], and served as the local branch's deputy chairman.

In 1935 he made [[aliyah]] to [[Mandatory Palestine]], where he served as secretary of HaOved HaLeumi until 1941. In 1949 he founded the Sela housing company and worked as its general manager.

In [[Israeli legislative election, 1959|1959]] he was elected to the Knesset on the Herut list. He was re-elected in [[Israeli legislative election, 1961|1961]], but lost his seat in the [[Israeli legislative election, 1965|1965 elections]], shortly before which Herut had formed the Gahal alliance.

He died in 1987 at the age of 71.

== Career ==
Motta recorded [[calypso (music)|calypso]] and [[mento]] style albums. He recorded on [[78 rpm]] records.

Talent from [[Vere Johns]] competitions was scouted by producers such as [[Clement "Coxsone" Dodd]] and [[Arthur "Duke" Reid]]. The groups recorded at Motta's studio. The records they cut would then be played on their [[Sound system (Jamaican)|sound systems]].&lt;ref name="Cooke2"&gt;Cooke, Mel (2010), "[http://www.jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20100302/ent/ent2.html Lincoln traces Ambassador music role to England]", ''Jamaica Gleaner'', 2 March 2010, retrieved 2010-05-03.&lt;/ref&gt;

Motta's electronics business became a subsidiary of Musson before it relaunched with an [[initial public offering]] (IPO) on the [[Jamaica Stock Exchange]] in 2018. It owns and manages the 58 HWT technology park property. The IPO raised $4 billion [[Jamaican dollar]]s for the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.loopjamaica.com/content/stanley-motta-lists-jse-after-4-billion-ipo-58-hwt|title=Stanley Motta lists on the JSE after $4 billion IPO on 58 HWT|website=www.loopjamaica.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''State Palaces, Castles and Gardens of Saxony''' ({{lang-de|Staatliche Schlösser, Burgen und Gärten Sachsen}}) is a state-owned company with its head office in [[Dresden]]. It belongs to the Saxon State Ministry of Finance and has the aim of preserving Saxon cultural heritage whilst respecting [[culture|cultural]] and [[architectural conservation|conservation]] needs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schloesserland-sachsen.de/cms/fileadmin/user_upload/bilder/Satzung_SSBG.pdf/ Satzung (pdf)]&lt;/ref&gt; The state-owned company manages several palaces, castles and parks in the [[Saxony]]. These include the [[Zwinger (Dresden)|Zwinger]] in [[Dresden]], the [[Albrechtsburg]] in [[Meissen]] and [[Kriebstein Castle]].

== History ==
Following the restoration of the [[Free State of Saxony]] on 3 October 1990, assets that had already been owned in the past by the state, or which had been managed during the East German era as legal entities under the Asset Allocation Act, were transferred into the ownership of the new German state.

Starting on the first of January 1992, the state took over the following properties: [[Dresden Castle]] including the [[Johanneum (Dresden)|Johanneum]] and the [[Stallhof (Dresden)|Stallhof]], the Dresden [[Zwinger (Dresden)|Zwinger]] and the Zwinger Gardens, the [[Japanese Palace]] with its palace garden, [[Pillnitz Castle|Pillnitz Castle and park]], [[Schloss Moritzburg|Moritzburg Palace]] and the surrounding landscape gardens, the [[Albrechtsburg|Albrechtsburg in Meißen]], [[Königstein Fortress]], [[Schloss Weesenstein]], [[Gnandstein Castle]], [[Frauenstein Castle (Ore Mountains)|Frauenstein castle ruins]], [[Großsedlitz Baroque Gardens]], [[Hubertusburg|Hubertusburg Palace]], [[Nischwitz Palace]], [[Burg Stolpen|Stolpen Castle]], [[Augustusburg Hunting Lodge|Augustusburg Palace]], [[Lichtenwalde Palace]], the [[Muskau Park|palace and park at Bad Muskau]], [[Colditz Castle]], [[Altzella Abbey]], [[Nossen Palace]], [[Pegau#Wiederau Palace|Wiederau Palace]], [[Mildenstein Castle]] and the [[Ortenburg (Bautzen)|Ortenburg]]&lt;ref&gt;Drucksache des Sächsischen Landtages 1/907&lt;/ref&gt;

In the following years, other historic buildings were allocated to the Free State of Saxony.

With a cabinet decision on third November 1992, 17 independent state companies were formed for some of the most important sites and placed under commercial management. These companies together formed the State Palaces Department (''Staatliche Schlösserverwaltung''). During the implementation phase, between 1 April 1993 and 1 January 1994, 15 state-owned enterprises were founded for the following properties:&lt;ref name="2/10146"&gt;Drucksache des Sächsischen Landtages 2/10146&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1 April 1993: the Albrechtsburg at Meißen, Augustusburg Palace, Scharfenstein Castle, Königstein Fortress, Moritzburg Palace
* 1 June 1993: Großsedlitz Baroque Gardens, Gnandstein Castle, Kriebstein Castle, Mildenstein Castle, Rammenau Palace, Stolpen Castle, Weesenstein Palace
* 1 August 1993: Dresden State Palaces and Gardens (''Staatliche Schlösser und Gärten Dresden'') (Pillnitz Palace and park, the Großer Garten, the Brühlsche Terrasse/Zwinger/Stallhof), Nossen Palace/Altzella Abbey Park
* 1 January 1994: Rochlitz Palace

In addition, the Palaces Department managed the following properties directly: the [[Albertinum (Dresden)|Albertinum]], the [[Catholic Church of the Royal Court of Saxony|Catholic Court Church]], the [[Jägerhof (Dresden)|Jägerhof]], the [[Freiberg Cathedral#Chancel and Royal Burial Chapel of the Albertines|Royal Burial Chapel at Freiberg]], [[Colditz Castle]], [[Lichtenwalde Palace]] and the [[Art Gallery in the Lipsius building|Exhibition Hall of the Academy of Art]].&lt;ref name="2/10146" /&gt;

The following properties remained under the administration of local authority land offices: the [[Japanese Palace]], [[Siebeneichen Palace]], [[Reinhardtsgrimma Palace]], the [[Ortenburg (Bautzen)|Ortenburg]], [[Hubertusburg|Hubertusburg Palace]], [[Freudenstein Castle]], [[Wurzen Palace]], [[Grimma Palace]] [[Königswartha#Palace and park|Königswartha Palace]], [[Suchominsky Villa]],  [[Sonnenstein Castle]], [[Dippoldiswalde Palace]], the [[Lauterstein Castle (Marienberg)|Niederlauterstein castle ruins]], the [[Frauenstein Castle (Ore Mountains)|Frauenstein castle ruins]], [[Wachwitz Palace]], the [[Wachwitz Palace|Royal Villa]],  [[Lützschena Palace]], [[Thallwitz Palace]], the [[Grillenburg Hunting Lodge]], [[Brauna Palace]], the [[Keppschloss]], [[Schieritz Palace|Zehren-Schieritz Palace]], [[Königsbrück Palace]], [[Gaussig House]], [[Hohenprießnitz Palace]] and [[Ruhenthal Palace]].&lt;ref name="2/10146" /&gt; Many of these sites were later transferred to the towns and cities in which they were situated or sold off to third parties.

On 1 March 1996 the Saxon Palaces Department was incorporated into the State Finance Office. On 1 July 2000 the companies running Königstein Fortress on the one hand and the castles of Augustusburg, Lichtenwalde, and Scharfenstein on the other hand were turned in a charitable company. Their owner remains the Free State of Saxony. The management of those involved is carried out by the Palaces Department.

In the period from 1993 to 2003 the Palaces Department's share of the cost rose from 37% to 61.4%. As of 1 January 2003, the Palaces Department was separate from the State Office and a common public enterprise, the "State Palaces, Castles and Gardens of Saxony", was founded. The palace companies are its individual business units.&lt;ref&gt;Drucksache des Sächsischen Landtages 3/8236&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proposed downtown Las Vegas arena==
Prior to the construction and opening of [[T-Mobile Arena]], Las Vegas officials envisioned a $400 million arena with about 20,000 seats, large enough to house an [[NBA]] team, with additional retail throughout. It would have gone on the northeastern edge of Symphony Park, close to the Smith Center for the Performing Arts.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2012/jul/15/glance-downtown-arena/&lt;/ref&gt; The project was envisioned to be a  private/public partnership between the city of Las Vegas and the [[Cordish Cos.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The project later morphed into a soccer stadium to attempt to attract a [[Major League Soccer]] franchise.&lt;ref&gt;https://lasvegassun.com/news/2014/may/14/las-vegas-could-get-mls-team-soccer-specific-stadi/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==

In the book, Johansson argues that innovation comes from diverse industries, cultures, and disciplines when they all intersect, bringing ideas from one field into another.&lt;ref name=WiredWOW/&gt; He also recommends assembling diverse teams of people to collaborate on innovation.&lt;ref name=TheBGlobSValley&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dabscheck|first1=David|title=Silicon Valley needs more foxes|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/opinion/2014/09/20/for-innovation-silicon-valley-needs-more-foxes/VhYrFOY43orE2VmSDQ5sNI/story.html|accessdate=5 June 2015|publisher=The Boston Globe|date=21 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name of the book is derived from the [[House of Medici|Medici Dynasty]], an [[Italy|Italian]] banking family that came to power in the 14th century. The family's wealth was able to support artists that led to [[The Renaissance]].&lt;ref name=WiredWOW/&gt;{{failed verification|date=July 2015}}{{unreliable source?|date=July 2015}} The book looks at examples of how Renaissance painters, sculptors, poets, philanthropists, scientists, philosophers, financiers, and architects, shaped historical eras of innovation.&lt;ref name=Buseinss2CommunityDebunking&gt;{{cite news|last1=Susco|first1=Darlene|title=Debunking 5 Myths of Innovation|url=http://www.business2community.com/business-innovation/debunking-5-myths-of-innovation-01238231|accessdate=5 June 2015|publisher=Business2Community|date=1 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Medici family did not intend the Renaissance, but contributed to it with what Johansson coins as the "Medici Effect."&lt;ref name=WiredWOW/&gt;

The book became the foundation for the "Medici Effect", a term that describes contributions of [[disruptive innovation]] from people who have no experience in an industry.&lt;ref name=WiredWOW/&gt; An example from the book includes Charles Darwin being a geologist and collecting a number of bird species from the [[Galápagos Islands]]. Darwin kept poor notes of his collection and returned the birds and notes over to [[John Gould]] upon his return.&lt;ref name=HBSchoolCreateME&gt;{{cite web|title=Create the Medici Effect|url=http://hbswk.hbs.edu/archive/4376.html|website=Harvard Business School|accessdate=5 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gould was an expert [[Ornithology|ornithologist]] and initially dismissed the birds as being normal. Gould later discovered that each species was in fact distinct.&lt;ref name=HBSchoolCreateME/&gt; The example from the book shows how Darwin, without the knowledge of ornithology, could contribute to the field without having the training or knowledge.&lt;ref name=HBSchoolCreateME/&gt;

==Reception==

''[[Bloomberg Businessweek|BusinessWeek]]'' called ''The Medici Effect'' "one of the best books on innovation."&lt;ref name=ConveneDontRun&gt;{{cite news|last1=Russell|first1=Michelle|title=Don't Run From Randomness|url=http://www.pcma.org/convene-content/convene-article/2012/12/01/dont-run-from-randomness#.VXIwJkb0eXc|accessdate=5 June 2015|publisher=Convene|date=December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was described as a "work of art" by ''[[Entrepreneur (magazine)|Entrepreneur]]''.&lt;ref name=Entreprworkofart&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hendricks|first1=Mark|title=A Work of Art - Creating a business masterpiece takes a palette of different ideas|url=http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/73662|accessdate=5 June 2015|publisher=Entrepreneur|date=30 November 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Washington Post]]'' said that Johansson has "written a book dozens of business school professors meant to write, but couldn't."&lt;ref name=WashPostReading&gt;{{cite news|title=Readings|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A37482-2004Oct16.html|accessdate=5 June 2015|publisher=The Washington Post|date=17 October 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harvard Business School professor [[Clayton M.

'''Traffic management''' is a key branch within [[logistics]]. It concerns the planning, control and purchasing of transport services needed to physically move vehicles (for example [[aircraft]], [[road vehicles]], [[rolling stock]] and [[watercraft]]) and [[freight]].

Traffic management is implemented by people working with different job titles in different branches:

* Within freight and cargo logistics: '''traffic manager''', assessment of hazardous and awkward materials, carrier choice and fees, [[demurrage]], documentation, [[expediting]], freight consolidation, insurance, reconsignment and tracking
* Within [[air traffic management]]: [[air traffic controller]]
* Within rail traffic management: [[rail traffic controller]], [[train dispatcher]] or [[Signalman (rail)|signalman]]
* Within [[road traffic management]]: [[traffic controller (disambiguation)|traffic controller]]

Traffic Control Management is the design, auditing and implementation of traffic control plans at worksites and civil infrastructure projects. Traffic Management can include but is not limited to: flagging, lane closures, detours, full freeway closures, pedestrian access, traffic plans and sidewalk closures.&lt;ref&gt;City Rise Safety [http://cityrisesafety.com/control Why Traffic Control is so important to the livelihood of your Community].&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2982">{{nihongo|'''Tsuneo Kusunoki'''|楠　恒男|Kusunoki Tsuneo}} is the founder of the now-bankrupt [[GEOS (eikaiwa)|GEOS Corporation]], previously one of the major [[eikaiwa]] (private school for conversational [[English language|English]]) providers in [[Japan]]. 
 
==GEOS==
===Founding===
In 1973, roommates [[Kiyoshi Aki]] and Tsuneo Kusunoki founded the company AMVIC, an acronym of the phrase, "for AMbition and VICtory." The company would focus on foreign language studies. 

Later, AMVIC International would be split into two divisions. Aki became the head of AMVIC Gaigogakuin (AMVIC　外語学院), which provided foreign language training for students. Kusunoki would assume control of the AMVIC Eikaiwa (AMVIC 英会話), which specialized in English language education for non-native speakers. In 1989, Kusunoki's branch of AMVIC International entered negotiations with [[Warner Pacific College]] to assume control of 49% of its physical plant for $6 million, a 30-year lease on the schools facilities, and a seat as a regent of the school.&lt;ref name=time&gt;
{{cite web 
|url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,956791,00.html
|title= Japan's Search for U.S. Colleges
|accessdate= 2007-08-12 
|publisher= Time Magazine
|date= 1989-01-23 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Not long after, AMVIC International split into two separate companies, after the former partners developed differing visions of the company's future. Aki went on to create [[Aeon (eikaiwa)|Aeon]], focusing on language learning in Japan. Aki remains Aeon's President. Kusunoki created GEOS, focusing on global language learning with focus on English language education.

===Financial crisis===
Kusunoki was the company's long standing President and CEO until April 2010.

Kusunoki, who has not been present at the press conferences, has said "the bankruptcy was filed by a member of the board and a small group of employees. It is not the will of the company." There has been some serious disagreement among the management at the company for some time. Specifically, those that filed the bankruptcy were board member Kazumi Sugihara and two employees. Normally filing for bankruptcy requires agreement among all the board members, but they filed under a special "semi-personal bankruptcy," something that according to GEOS' lawyer Nobuaki Kobayashi is perfectly legal and valid. Kusunoki's complaints may hold up the bankruptcy process significantly.&lt;ref&gt;http://headlines.yahoo.co.jp/hl?a=20100422-00000079-mai-bus_all{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Murray was born on 22 July 1932, in [[Clonmel]], [[County Tipperary]] to parents, Jeremiah Murray and Mai Lynch Murray.&lt;ref name=it&gt;{{cite news |first=|last=|title=Goods Council chief executive who created Buy Irish scheme|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/obituaries/2009/0314/1224242845920.html|work=[[Irish Times]]|publisher=|date=14 March 2009 |accessdate=5 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was one of six children in his family.&lt;ref name=it/&gt; Murray attended the [[CBS High School Clonmel|Christian Brothers High School]] in his native Clonmel.&lt;ref name=it/&gt;

==Irish Goods Council==
{{see also|Guaranteed Irish}}
Murray's career began to take off when he was appointed general manager at the Irish National Development Association.  The organisation would later be renamed the Irish Goods Council and was funded by the Irish government.&lt;ref name=it/&gt; Under Murray, the Irish Goods Council would be known as a champion of Irish products, sold both domestically and abroad.

He became widely known for his launch of the "Guaranteed Irish" and "Buy Irish" marketing and [[advertising campaign]]s of the 1970s and 1980s, which were aimed at Irish consumers.&lt;ref name=rte/&gt; Murray's "Buy Irish" was based on his own beliefs that quality was more important in Irish products than merely purchasing an item because it was made in Ireland.&lt;ref name=it/&gt; He also believed that the Buy Irish campaign, as it came to be called, should focus on the Irish consumer market.&lt;ref name=it/&gt; Murray also felt that low quality products should not be supported by the "Buy Irish" campaign.&lt;ref name=it/&gt;
Murray felt that [[free trade]] was important, but did not want the "Buy Irish" campaign to heavily emphasise exports, which he believed was detrimental to the domestic Irish manufacturing and consumer markets.&lt;ref name=it/&gt; However, he was also strongly against any intrusion by Irish protectionists into the marketing campaign.&lt;ref name=it/&gt; Th campaign was credited with saving thousands of domestic manufacturing jobs, especially for younger people.&lt;ref name=it/&gt; He explained his goals for the Irish Goods Council and its "Buy Irish" campaign in 1980 saying, "What the Irish Goods Council does is to create the selling environment, develop new patterns of [[consumer behavior|consumer desire]], build up [[Social capital|goodwill]] and favourable attitudes. These attitudes must then be exploited by the manufacturer."&lt;ref name=it/&gt; Murray's success at the Irish Goods Council was widely noted. He and his colleagues at the Council were praised by then [[Seanad Éireann|Senator]] [[Mary Harney]] during a 1980 [[political debate]].&lt;ref name=it/&gt; However, success ended during the 1980s. The "Guaranteed Irish" [[promotional campaign]] was founded to be in violation of the [[European Union]]'s [[Treaty of Rome]].&lt;ref name=it/&gt; As a result, the Irish government soon cut its state funding for the campaign. Murray left the Irish Goods Council in 1989.&lt;ref name=it/&gt; However, he was still named the Small Firms' Association Business Person of the Year in 1989, the same year he left the Irish Goods Council.&lt;ref name=it/&gt;

==Other positions==
Murray simultaneously appointed the chairman of the [[Bord Iascaigh Mhara]] in 1981 while still heading the Irish Goods Council.&lt;ref name=it/&gt; He stayed on as chairman of Bord Iascaigh Mhara for two terms.&lt;ref name=it/&gt;

He next became the chairman of [[An Post]] in 1990 following his departure from the Irish Goods Council and was credited with returning the Irish postal system to [[Profit (accounting)|profitability]] during his tenure.&lt;ref name=it/&gt; Murray also joined the Gray-Murray [[consulting firm]], which is now known as Indecon.&lt;ref name=it/&gt;

==Later life==
Vivian Murray fully retired from the business world during the middle of the 1990s.&lt;ref name=it/&gt; However, he continued to remain active in other causes and foundations. For example, he collaborated closely with [[Roman Catholic]] Father [[James McDyer]] in [[Glencolumcille]], [[County Donegal]], to establish projects to promote [[Irish culture]].&lt;ref name=it/&gt;
He was appointed to the [[board of trustees]] of the [[Louvain Institute]] for Ireland in Europe. The Louvain Institute, which was created to promote Ireland and its cultural heritage in the European Union, is headquartered at the [[Irish College]] in [[Leuven]], Belgium.&lt;ref name=it/&gt; Murray was later awarded a fellowship by the institute.

Murray's had other very wide ranging life accomplishments and community involvements. He was appointed as a member of the first [[Independent Radio and Television Commission]].&lt;ref name=rte/&gt; Murray served as a former director of the former [[LSB College]], which has since become part of the [[Dublin Business School]]. He was also an active member of the [[The Priory Institute|Priory Institute]], which is part of the St Mary's Dominican Priory in [[Tallaght]], [[County Dublin]].&lt;ref name=it/&gt;

Vivian Murray died in [[Dublin]] on 6 March 2008, at the age of 76 after a long illness.&lt;ref name=rte/&gt; Murray was survived by his wife, Nancy (née Clear), and six children – daughters Mary, Anne, Bernie and Madeleine and sons, Dermot and John.&lt;ref name=rte/&gt;
